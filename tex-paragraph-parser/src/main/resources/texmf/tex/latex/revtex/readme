Other files in this package are copyrighted as stated, and their rights

This version of REVTeX is a cooperative product of the American Physical
Society (APS), American Institute of Physics (AIP), and Optical Society of
America (OSA).

The Joint Society Task Force, comprised of AIP and AIP Member Societies has
appointed a REVTeX Working Group in order to coordinate the development and
evolution of a joint electronic publishing product and mark-up language
standards amongst the participating societies.

Those authors interested in publishing articles in the journals of the
American Astronomical Society should use AASTeX (the LaTeX-based mark-up
developed by the American Astronomical Society). One of the primary objectives
of the REVTeX Working Group is to make REVTeX and AASTeX as similar as
possible. Authors will use many of the same mark-up tags in manuscripts prepared
using either REVTeX or AASTeX. Style differences in the journals---for example,
the manner in which citations are handled (numerical reference or author/date
format)---require that authors actually write different text. Thus, it is
important that authors identify the journal they intend to publish in and use
the appropriate electronic publishing product.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GETTING STARTED %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You must have TeX and LaTeX running to use these macros. All macros
run on a standard LaTeX format.

Installing to just test the macros can be accomplished by copying all the
files into an unused directory, then changing to that directory. All the
files and facilities of REVTeX should then be usable while you are in that
directory.

A more permanent installation would usually mean installing the .sty files
and reftest.tex file into the directory where TeX usually looks for input
files, the .bst files into the directory where BibTeX usually looks for its
style files, and the rest of the files into a REVTeX working directory or a
public directory, depending on your system setup. Care should be taken to
avoid writing over files already present. The files in the REVTeX package have
been named to help avoid this problem, but there can be no guarantee that
our file names are unique.

If you are permanently upgrading an older version of REVTeX (<3.0), the files
from the old version should be removed first. You may delete these files or
save them somewhere where they will not be found by TeX when it looks for
style files. Here is a list of the older files:

      readme        % make sure you only delete the REVTeX readme!
      revtex.sty
      aps.sty
      aps10.sty
      aps12.sty
      preprint.sty
      eqsecnum.sty
      smplea.tex
      smpleb.tex
      smplec.tex
      apguide.tex

Older versions of REVTeX (<3.0) will not coexist with this version.

The next thing you need to do is run LaTeX on the files for the input guide.
The input guide consists of common introductory material (manintro.tex),
society-specific chapters (manaps.tex for APS, manosa.tex for OSA, and
manaip.tex for AIP), and common appendixes (manend.tex). Run LaTeX on, and
print, manintro.tex, the desired society-specific chapters, and manend.tex.
Gathering the printed material together in order will provide all needed
information. There is a general table of contents in manintro.tex, and
separate tables of contents in each society's chapter. Carefully read the
intructions in the appropriate chapter of the Input Guide. The sample file(s)
and template will also contain useful examples and explanations.

You may get a number of "Underfull \hbox . . ." messages when running the
documentation and samples; these are normal. Also, you may need to LaTeX
these files three times to complete all references and build the table of
contents.

If needed, consult a local (La)TeX user or system support person for
information on how to run LaTeX and print its output on your local system.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ERROR REPORTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before you report an error please check that

  - the error isn't caused by obsolete versions of other software.
    LaTeX from 1986 is a good candidate; for example, negative indents
    (outdents) following an equation environment.

  - you use an original version of the package.


If you think you have found a genuine bug please report it, together
with the following information:

  - version of the REVTeX file(s)

  - version (date!) of your LaTeX

  - a short test file showing the behavior with all unnecessary
    coding removed. The log file showing the problem might also help.


Errors should be reported to the person listed in your copy of the
user guide.
