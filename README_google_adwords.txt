Google Adwords.

# Glossary.

Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave a website after viewing only
    one page.
Click-Through-Rate (CTR): number of clicks the ad receives divided by the
    number of times it is shown.
Conversion: someone clicks your ad and then takes an action that youâ€™ve defined
    as valuable
Cost-per-click (CPC): average amount charged per click on the ad, i.e. the
    total cost of all clicks divided by the total number of clicks received.
Impressions: how often the ad appears on search result pages or websites on the
    Google Network.
Maximum CPC (bid): the most you are willing to pay for a click on your ad
Pay-per-click (PPC): Adwords only charges advertisers when a user clicks on one
    of their ads
Return of Investment (ROI): How much profit you've made from your ads compared
    to how much you've spent on those ads.

# Basics

(1) Adwords is based on campaigns. There are different campaign types:
        * Google Search Network: The ads are shown in search results of Google 
          (and partner sites).
        * Google Display Network: The ads are automatically matched to websites
          and other placements, that show AdWords ads related to the content of
          the page.
    One can choose where the ads should be displayed: one of them or both.
(2) For each campaign, you must define your bid and budget. 
        * A bid is the most you're willing to pay for a click on your ad
        * The budget establishes a charging limit for an individual campaign.
    There are a couple of autmoatic bidding strategires (e.g., for maximizing
    clicks)
(3) You can define AdGroups, consisting of multiple ads for the same product.
        * Good for trying out different ad formats.
        * You configure Adwords, such that only the "best" ad is displayed.
(4) The position of the ad depends on the ad Rank. 
        * ad rank = maximum CPC * quality score
        * Quality Score: ranking between 1 and 10. Depends on:
            * Click-Through Rate.
            * Landing Page Experience
            * Ad relevance.
(5) Ads can be restricted to
        * different devices (mobiles, desktop, etc.)
        * different countries and regions
        * different languages
(6) Keyword matching options
        * Broad match: Ads may show on searches that include misspellings,
          synonyms, related searches, and other relevant variations.
            Example: Keywords: nike shoes. Matching Query: "nike sneaker"
        * Broad match modifier: Ads may show on searches that contain the
          modified term (or close variations, but not synonyms), in any order.
            Example: Keywords: +nike shoes. Matching Queries: "shoes nike", 
                     "nike shoe", "nike shoes yellow".
        * Phrase matches: Ads may show on searches that are a phrase, and close
          variations of that phrase.
            Example: Keywords: "nike shoes". Matching Query: "yellow nike shoes"
        * Exact matches: Ads may show on searches that are an exact term and
          close variations of that exact term.
            Example: Keywords: "nike shoes". Matching Query: "nike shoes"
        * Negative match: Ads may show on searches without the term.

# Best practices.

Campaign:
    * Create a campaign for each single product/service you want to advertise.
Budget:
    * Start with low daily budget, and increase it over time.
    * In particular, increase the budget of the campaigns generating the most
      clicks.
Audience:
    * Define your target audience: who, where and what languages do they speak?
Ads:
    * Create 3-4 ads per AdGroup to let Google choose the most effective one.
    * The title of the ad is important. In contrast, the text of the ad has
      quite low impact.
    * Focus on budget and keywords.
    * Add sitelinks.
Keywords:
    * Choose high-quality keywords (that matches the text of ad and website).
    * Put keywords from the AdGroup into the text of ad.
    * General keywords are quite expensive (resulting in low positions).
    * Choose language-dependent keywords and include wrong spellings.
    * Find tradeoff between the fit of keywords and website, but without
      overloading the website with too much informations.
Costs:
    * Depends on campaign, ~0.50 - 0.75$ / click.
    * Needs ~2 days to setup; 1.5 day per week to maintain
    * There is a certain threshold to cross in order for your ad to be eligible
      to enter in an auction (you cannot bidy only 5 cents when there are no
      other bids).
    * Seeing no ads for a particular query, does not mean that no one else is
      bidding on those keywords and it certainly does not mean you can get
      clicks for cheap.
Website:
    * Build a high-quality, nice-looking landing page. Consider the standards
      given by Google (in terms of relevant and original content, transparency, 
      and navigability) [3].
    * Define a clear conversion to be able to measure the ROI
Quality Score:
    * Check destination url:
        - Remove forward slashed and backward slashes
        - Remove commands, apostrophes, parentheses and ampersands.
    * Check your site speed.
Other:
    * Link your Google AdWords and Google Analytics accounts to use the insights
      to refine and optimize your campaigns.
