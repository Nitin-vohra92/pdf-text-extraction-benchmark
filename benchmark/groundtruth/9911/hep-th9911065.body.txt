La Plata-Th 99/11 IP-BBSR 99/32 Monopoles in non-Abelian Einstein-Born-Infeld Theory

and Fidel A. Schaposnik

The Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) model has recently received special consideration in connection with string theory and D-brane dynamics after the discovery that the low energy effective action for D-branes is precisely described by the DBI action [\cite=fradkin]-[\cite=leigh] (for a review see ). BPS solutions to DBI theory for gauge fields and scalars were then studied and interpreted in terms of branes pulled by strings [\cite=juan]-[\cite=Hashi].

Different non-Abelian generalization of the DBI action have been proposed [\cite=nappi]-[\cite=park]. They differ in the way a scalar action is defined from objects carrying group indices. The use of a symmetrised trace proposed by Tesytlin [\cite=aat2] in the context of superstring theory seems to be the natural one in connection with supersymmetry and leads to a linearized Lagrangian with BPS equations identical to Yang-Mills ones [\cite=brecher]-[\cite=chr]. The use of the ordinary trace and other recipes for defining the DBI action have been also investigated [\cite=park].

Vortex, monopole and other soliton-like solutions to theories containing a DBI action have been studied for Abelian and non-Abelian gauge symmetry [\cite=nakamura]-[\cite=galtsov], in this last case both using the symmetrised and the normal trace operation to define a scalar DBI action. A distinctive feature was discovered for DBI vortices and monopoles: there exists a critical value βc of the Born-Infeld β-parameter below which regular solutions cease to exist [\cite=moreno]-[\cite=pakman]. In the non-Abelian case, this critical value can be tested only when the normal trace is adopted since, for the symmetrised trace, the Lagrangian is known only as a perturbative series in 1 / β and the results are valid outside the domain where β-criticality takes place.

The existence of βc is much resemblant to the phenomenon occuring for self-gravitating monopoles [\cite=ortiz]-[\cite=volkov], that exhibit a critical behavior with respect to the strength of the gravitational interaction: above some maximum value of a parameter α, related to the strength of gravitational interaction, regular monopole solutions collapse. This behavior, originally described in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, has been shown to take place also when the DBI action governs the dynamics of the gauge field [\cite=pkt1] [\cite=pkt2]. Since the symmetric trace has been adopted in these last references, the existence of βc in DBI theories coupled to gravity could not be analysed; it is the purpose of the present work to address this issue, namely, to study the Einstein-DBI-Higgs model using the normal trace for defining the DBI action, find self-gravitating monopole solutions, determine whether they cease to exist below some critical value βc as in the flat space case and, in the affirmative, study the interplay between α and βc.

We consider the following Einstein-Born-Infeld-Higgs action for SU(2) fields with the Higgs field in the adjoint representation

[formula]

with

[formula]

and the non Abelian Born-Infeld Lagrangian,

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and the trace tr in Lagrangian ([\ref=2]) is defined so that tr(tatb)  =  δab.

Here we are interested in purely magnetic configurations, hence we have Fμνμν  =  0. The elementary excitations are a massless photon, two massive charged vectors bosons with mass MW  =  ev, and a massive neutral Higgs scalar with mass [formula]. Varying the action with respect to the matric we obtain the following expression for the energy-momentum tensor

[formula]

For static spherical symmetric solutions, the metric can be parametrized as

[formula]

We consider the 't Hooft-Polyakov ansatz for the gauge and scalar fields

[formula]

and

[formula]

Putting the above ansatz in Eq.1, defining α2  =  4πGv2 and rescaling R  →  R / ev, r(R)  →  r(R) / ev and β  →  βev2 we get the following expression for the Lagrangian

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here the prime denotes differentiation with respect to R. The dimensionless parameter α can be expressed as the mass ratio

[formula]

where [formula] is the Planck mass. As expected in the limit of β  →    ∞   the above action reduces to that of the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs model. Also, the limit α  =  0, for which we must have ν(R)  =  0  =  λ(R) corresponds to the flat space Born-Infeld-Higgs theory. Note that the use of the normal trace allowed to reaccomodate the Lagrangian in terms of a square root without reference to the gauge group generators; this is not possible for the case of the symmetyrized trace.

From now on we consider the gauge r(R)  =  R, corresponding to the Schwarzschild-like coordinates and rename R  =  r. We define A  =  eν  +  λ and N  =  e- 2λ. Integrating the tt component of the energy-momentum we get the mass of the monopole equal to M / evG where

[formula]

Following 't Hooft the electromagnetic U(1) field strength Fμν can be defined as

[formula]

Then using the ansatz(3) the magnetic field

[formula]

is equal to eir  /  er2 with a total flux 4π / e and unit magnetic charge.

The tt and rr components of Einstein's equations are

[formula]

and the matter field equations are

[formula]

Note that the field A can be elliminated from the matter field equations using Eq.(12).

Now we consider the globally regular solution to the above equations. Expanding the fields in powers of r and keeping the leading order terms we obtain the following expressions near the origin

[formula]

where c is expressed interms of the free parameters a and b as

[formula]

We are looking for asymptotically flat solution and hence we impose

[formula]

Then the gauge and the Higgs fields has the following behaviour in the asymptotically far region:

[formula]

We solved the equations of motion numerically using the above boundary conditions. The solutions are pretty much the same as those for the case of the symmerised trace for β  ~  1 and they agree with the corresponding solution for the Yang-Mills-Higgs case for lagre β . For a definite value of β, the solution exists up to some critical value αmax of the parameter α. The minima of the metric function decreases as we increase the value of α for α  <  αmax and it approches zero for α  →  αmax. The solution does not exist for α  >  αmax. It is observed that when we decrease the value of β the αmax goes on increaseing. The values of αmax for different β are given in table 1. However it is also found that, similar to the flat space monopoles there is a critical value βc for finite α, and the solutions does not exist for β  <  βc. For α  =  1 and g  =  0 we find βc  ~  0.1 which is much smaller than the corresponding value for flat space which is approximately 0.5. The profile for different values of α,β for the case of g  =  0 are given in the Figs.1,2&3.

To understand these results, let us recall that the existence of an upper bound αmax for the gravitation strength can be interpreted by observing that monopole mass/  radius ratio increases as α increases so that αmax can be seen as the value at which the monopole becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses -[\cite=LW]. This for Yang-Mills action, which corresponds to the β  →    ∞   limit of DBI action. Now, as β decreases from its limiting value, the mass of the monopole decreases (see Table 2) so that the collapse should occur for a value αβmax  >  αβ  =    ∞max, as observed in our solutions. The same kind of analysis can be performed regarding the lowering of βc as α increases: as shown in [\cite=moreno]-[\cite=pakman], the singular behavior occuring at βc manifests as an abrupt descent in the soliton mass, a phenomenon which is in concurrence with the enhancing of the mass as α grows. That is the reason why βαc  <  βα = 0c.

In summary, we analysed the gravitating monopole solutions in non-Abelian Born-Infeld-Higgs system with a normal trace structure. The solutions exist up to some critical value βc of the Born-Infeld parameter β below which there is no solution. It was not possible to study this feature in the corresponding model with symmetrised trace structure since the perturbative expansion implicit in this case is not valid for small β. We also found that the parameter α has some maximum allowed value αmax for a definite β. This αmax increases as we decrease β. It would be worth studying if the similar behaviour occures in case of non-Abelian black holes. Also it should be possible to study the dyon solutions in the non-Abelian model with normal trace structure.
