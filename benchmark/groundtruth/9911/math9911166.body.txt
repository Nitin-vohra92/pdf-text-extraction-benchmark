Equidimensionality of complex Lagrangian fibrations

Introduction

First we define Lagrangian subvariety .

Let X be a manifold with a holomorhpic symplectic form ω. A subvariety Y is said to be Lagrangian subvariety if dim Y  =  (1 / 2) dim X and there exists a resolution ν:  →  Y such that ν*ω is identically zero on [formula].

Note that this notion does not depend the choice of ν. We prove the following theorem.

Let f:X  →  B be a proper surjective morphism over a normal base B. Assume that X is a Kähler manifold with holomorphic symplectic form ω and a general fiber of f is a Lagrangian submanifold with respect to ω. Then every irreducible component of a fibre of f is a Lagrangian subvariety.

From Theorem [\ref=main], we obtain the following corollary.

Under the situation above, f is equidimensional. Especially f is flat if B is smooth.

Combining Corollary [\ref=equi_dimensional] with [\cite=matsu] and [\cite=matsu2], we obtain the following result.

Let f:X  →  B be a fibre space of an irreducible symplectic manifold X over a normal Kähler base B. Then f is equidimensional.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

We refer the following theorem due to Kollár [\cite=kollar] and Saito [\cite=saito]

Let f:X  →  B be a proper surjective morhpism from a smooth Kähler manifold X to a normal variety B. Then Rif*ωX is torsion free, where ωX is the dualizing sheaf of X.

Let [formula] be the complex conjugate of ω. By Leray spectral sequence, there exists a morphism

[formula]

Then [formula] is a torsion element in H0(B,R2f*OX) since a general fibre of f is a Lagrangian manifold. In addition, [formula]. Hence [formula] is zero in H0(B,R2f*OX) by Theorem [\ref=kollar]. We derive a contradiction assuming that there exists an irrducible component of a fibre of f which is not a Lagrangian subvariety. The letter V denotes an non Lagrangian component. We take an embedding resolution π:  →  X of V. Let ṽ be the proper transform of V. We will show that π*ω is not zero in H0(ṽ,Ω2ṽ). If dim V  =  (1 / 2) dim X, it is obious by the definition. If dim V  >  (1 / 2) dim X, we take a smooth point q∈V such that π is isomorhpic in a neighborhood of q. Since dim V  >  (1 / 2) dim X and ω is nondegenerate, the restriction of ω on the tangent space of V at q is nonzero. Because π is isomorphic in a neighborhood of q, π*ω is not zero in H0(ṽ,Ω2ṽ). Take the complex conjugate, π* is not zero in H2(ṽ,Oṽ). Therefore [formula] is not zero in H2(V,OV). Let p: = f(V) and Xp: = f- 1(p). We consider the following morphism:

[formula]

Then [formula] is zero in [formula] and notzero in H2(V,OV). That is a contradiction.
