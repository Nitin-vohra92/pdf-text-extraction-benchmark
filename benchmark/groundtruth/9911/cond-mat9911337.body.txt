Introduction

The attractive Hubbard model is very challenging for theorists since its physics is bearing quite some resemblance to the underdoped regime in High Temperature Superconductors [\cite=1], [\cite=2].

In the present paper we treat analytically the intermediate coupling regime of this model. There are two characteristic temperatures in this regime. The first one is a crossover temperature [formula], where the density of electrons in bound pairs [formula] is equal to the density of unpaired electrons nF. Of course, the total density of charge carriers in the system satisfies the condition [formula]. The second temperature [formula] is a Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature [\cite=3] of a superfluid transition in 2D. We consider the low-temperature normal regime of the model [formula].

Theoretical model and results

We consider an attractive-U Hubbard model [\cite=5] (U < 0) in the intermediate coupling regime [formula]. We restrict our calculations to low density limit In this limit the crossover temperature [formula] is given by [\cite=5]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the binding energy of a local pair on the empty lattice [\cite=5]. At the same time, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature reads [\cite=6], [\cite=7]:

[formula]

Low density means that [formula], or, in another words: [formula] [formula].

We first calculate the two-particle T-matrix for small ω and q. This yields:

[formula]

It is important to note that the pole-structure of the T-matrix reflects the creation of a bound pair with a mass [formula] and a bosonic chemical potential [formula], where μ is the one-particle chemical potential. As a result, we obtain the following expression for the one-particle spectral function:

[formula]

This expression describes an assymmetric two-band structure, consisting of a fermionic band and a bosonic band separated by a correlation gap [formula]. For [formula]: [formula], hence [formula] and we have a new type of metal: a normal bosonic metal. Let us study the resistivity and specific heat of this metal. At very low densities, when not only the parameter [formula], but also [\cite=6], [\cite=7] [formula], the Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature is smaller than the degeneracy temperature T0  =   [formula] of a 2D gas of bound pairs. In this case the bosonic chemical potential at temperatures T < T0 becomes exponentially small and reads: [formula]. As a result, the specific heat of the system becomes linear [\cite=8]: Cv = nT / T0 for T < T0. Note that since Cv = n for T > T0 there is no λ-point in our system.

Finally, the resistivity changes its behavior [\cite=8] from [formula] for T > T0 on [formula] for T  <  T0.

Conclusions

We would like to emphasize that already such a simple theory, as presented above, brings a lot of similarities with the recent results of beautiful tunneling experiments [\cite=9] in underdoped regime of HTSC-materials. These similarities include a large value of the ratio of [formula]~  8  ÷  10 and a strong anisotropy of the density of states both in theory and in experiment. Note that in our theory [formula].
