Explicit formulae describing the genus one characters and modular transformation properties of permutation orbifolds of arbitrary Rational Conformal Field Theories are presented, and their relation to the theory of covering surfaces is investigated.

If C denotes a Rational Conformal Field Theory, its n-th tensor power [formula] is straightforward to describe for any positive integer n, e.g. the primary fields are just n-tuples of primaries of C, and their ( genus one ) characters are simply the product of the corresponding C characters. An interesting feature of these theories is that any permutation x∈Sn of the n "replicas" is a global symmetry of [formula], so it is possible to orbifoldize [formula] by any permutation group Ω < Sn. For reasons to become clear soon, we shall denote the resulting permutation orbifold by [formula].

The first systematic investigation of permutation orbifolds has been performed in [\cite=1] ( see also [\cite=2] ). Permutation orbifold techniques have been applied in [\cite=DMV2] to compute the free energy of second quantized strings. Recently, a detailed analysis of cyclic permutation orbifolds, i.e. the case [formula] for prime n, has been presented in [\cite=BHS], where the explicit form of the genus one characters and their modular properties can be found for [formula]. The aim of the present paper is to generalize the above results to arbitrary - possibly nonabelian - Ω, and to understand the underlying geometry. We shall only sketch the main results, their derivation being left to a future publication.

The basic observation, which lies behind most of the results to be presented, is that if [formula] denotes the wreath product of the permutation groups Ω1 and Ω2 ( c.f. [\cite=ker] ), then the [formula] permutation orbifold of C is nothing but the Ω2 permutation orbifold of [formula], i.e.

[formula]

This property, which explains our choice for the notation, is a straigthforward consequence of the definition of the wreath product. In particular if C is holomorphic, i.e. it has only one primary with respect to the maximally extended chiral algebra - e.g. the E8 WZNW model at level 1 -, the permutation orbifold [formula] is a holomorphic orbifold model, whose properties are described by the double D(Ω) of the group Ω [\cite=DPR] [\cite=B1].

A most important consequence of Eq. ([\ref=wr]) is the following description of the primary field content of permutation orbifolds : the primary fields of [formula] are in one-to-one correspondence with the pairs 〈p,φ〉, where p is some representative of an orbit of Ω acting on the n-tuples [formula] of primaries pi of C, while φ is an irreducible character of the double D(Ωp) of the stabilizer

of the n-tuple p.

If, as usual, 0 denotes the vacuum of C, then the vacuum of [formula] - which we shall also denote by 0 in the sequel - corresponds to the pair 〈0,φ0〉, where
