Recently, various numerical integration techniques are developed to simulate the dynamics of complex systems with many-body interactions. Above all, symplectic integrators are important because they exactly preserve the symplectic form [formula] which any natural Hamiltonian H() must have. Thus, it is very important to investigate and estimate how these symplectic integrators improve our capacity of tracking many-body dynamics. We consider the following simple system to be tested:

[formula]

The equations of motion remain invariant under the transformation [formula]), where t is a time variable and α is an arbitrary real and dimensionless quantity which does not vanish. Thus, our simulations do not depend on the scale of time. It is known that this quartic potential system shows chaotic behavior, as is predicted by the non-integrability proof[\cite=zig]. Furthermore, the system ([\ref=eq:hami]) allows not only chaotic but also intermittent behavior, which significantly affects the accuracy of the higher-order symplectic simulations[\cite=ku] [\cite=suku].

In this paper, we investigate the time step-size dependences of its simulations by two different explicit type higher-order symplectic integrators, namely (i) Suzuki's third-order symplectic integrator and (ii) Ruth's third-order symplectic integrator, which are obtained by the real decompositions of exponential operators;

[formula]

where Δt is a time step-size and the coefficients c1,c2,c3,d1,d2,d3 are given as

[formula]

in (i)Suzuki's case[\cite=su] or they are given as

[formula]

in (ii)Ruth's case[\cite=ru]. The main reason why we use third-order symplectic integrators here lies in the fact that they are already higher-order than the popular leap-flog method (the second-order integrator) and it is also guaranteed that there are no other third-order symplectic integrators with real coefficients[\cite=su]. In cases of separable Hamiltonian systems H() = K() + V(), the implementation of these third-order symplectic integrators is straightforward as follows:

[formula]

where [formula]. In our simulations here, we always fix the initial condition as (q1,q2,p1,p2) = (1000,0.002,0,0) to cause a strong intermittency . Around this initial condition, we can employ the adiabatic approximation as

[formula]

where [formula] is a slow variable. A fast dynamics is simply described by the harmonic oscillator [formula] with the spring coefficient k = q21. Thus, the adiabatic invariant J is given by the formula

[formula]

because k = q21 = 10002 and E2 = 4 hold at the initial condition. Thus, we have a slow dynamics given by the Hamiltonian [formula] and therefore we can obtain the analytic solution of this slow dynamics

[formula]

By considering that the hypothesis of this adiabatic approximation is based on the assumption |q1|  ≫  1, an adiabatic transition is predicted to occur at t = T given by

[formula]

where q1(t = T)  ≈  0. Figure 1 shows that the third-order symplectic integrator with a step-size Δt = 0.001 can correctly track the adiabatic transition at t = 1000. Figure 2 shows that a slight step-size difference cause the great discrepancy in tracking the trajectory (q1(t),q2(t)), even though each third-order symplectic integrator with the step-size around Δt = 0.001 can give the correct behavior of adiabatic transitions like Fig.1. Figure 3.(a)-(c) show that this effect of step-size dependences of the dynamical variable q2 at the fixed transition time t = 1000 is extraordinary complex beyond our imagination. Remark that this effect does not depend on the choice of integrators as is indicated in Fig.3.(a)-(c). This result suggests that the following usual argument that "if Δt = 0.002 is not O.K, then Δt = 0.001 is maybe O.K." is generally untrue unless the step-size Δt is sufficiently small such as 0 < Δt  ≤  0.0001 like Fig.3.(c). Thus, this kind of complex behavior of step-size dependences can be a real challenge to the solid progress in the studies of many-body dynamics simulations, since the intractability here is closely related to the non-integrable character of generic many-body systems[\cite=ku1] [\cite=ku2], whether the simulations are classical or quantum ones[\cite=ku3].
