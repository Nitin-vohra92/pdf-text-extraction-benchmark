Introduction

The problem of cosmological constant, Λ, or, what is the same, of vacuum energy is one of the most or just the most striking problem in the contemporary fundamental physics. This is a unique case when theoretical expectations differ from observations at least by 1045 or maybe even by 120 (!) orders of magnitude. It is known from cosmology that vacuum energy would influence the evolution of the universe and from the absence of the noticeable changes with respect to the usual Friedman model one may deduce that |Ωvac|  =  |ρvac  /  ρc|  ≤  1. Here ρc = 3H2m2Pl / 8π  ≈  10- 29g  /  cm3  ≈  10- 47GeV4 is the critical energy density. So we can conclude that

[formula]

On the other hand, quantum field theory predicts that there are plenty of contributions into vacuum energy which are larger than this bound, roughly speaking, by 50-100 orders of magnitude.

Sometimes astronomers put a different meaning into the words "the problem of cosmological constant". Namely, there is a continuous discussion, if Ωvac is exactly zero (or unnoticeably small) or it may be close to unity so that its effects on universe evolution are essential. In particular, the relation between the universe age, tU, and the present-day value of the Hubble constant, H0, depends upon the magnitude of Λ and the discrepancy between the large values of H0 and tU would disappear if Ωvac  =  0.7 - 0.8. With the same value of Ωvac the theory of large scale structure formation gives a better description of the data than just with Λ  =  0. (Let us note that the relation between ρvac and Λ is given by the expression ([\ref=lamrho]) below.) It is quite mysterious why the value of ρvac, which remains constant in the course of the universe expansion, is so close today to the value of the critical energy density which falls down as 1 / t2 (in cosmologies with Ωtot = 1). It adds up to the other two mysteries: why the energy density of baryons, which contributes into Ω at a per cent level, and energy densities of hot and cold dark matter (if both or any one of the latter exist) all are close to each other within the order of magnitude, though they seem to be unrelated and could easily differ by several (many?) orders of magnitude.

We will concentrate on the first problem, namely why vacuum energy is tiny on the scale of elementary particle physics despite all huge contributions (see below). The other problem, if vacuum energy is cosmologically noticeable, is not directly addressed here but it is quite possible that the solution to the first problem (which is unknown at the present day) could help to solve the second one too.

History of the Problem

Cosmological constant was introduced in 1918 by Einstein [\cite=ae] when he unsuccessfully tried to apply General Relativity equations to cosmology and was disappointed to find that there were no stationary solutions. The usual Einstein equations have the form:

[formula]

where the source of gravity is the energy-momentum tensor of matter, T(mat)μν. These equations do not have static solutions for homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter. To overcome this, what seemed to be a shortcoming, Einstein proposed to add an extra term into this equations, Λgμν:

[formula]

where gμν is the metric tensor and Λ is a constant which got the name cosmological constant. As it was understood later this new term corresponds to a nonzero energy-momentum tensor of vacuum and Λ is related to the vacuum energy density as:

[formula]

It can be shown that a positive ρvac induces gravitational repulsion, so that the introduction of the cosmological term may balance the gravitational attraction of the usual matter and correspondingly may lead to stationary solutions of eq. ([\ref=einlam]). To this end a careful tuning of ρ(mat) and ρvac should be arranged. What is worse, this static solution is evidently unstable with respect to density perturbations. After Friedman [\cite=af] had found the non-stationary cosmological solution and especially after Hubble [\cite=hub] discovered that the universe indeed expands in accordance with this solution, Einstein very strongly objected the idea of nonzero lambda-term and considered it as the biggest blunder of his life. In drastic contrast to that opinion Lemaitre [\cite=lem] advocated the introduction of cosmological constant as a great discovery.

It was much later stressed by Zeldovich [\cite=ybz] that quantum field theory generically demands that cosmological constant or, let us repeat, what is the same, vacuum energy is non-vanishing. It is very well known from quantum mechanics that the ground state energy of harmonic oscillator is not zero but equal to ω / 2. It can be understood in the following way: a particle "siting" on the bottom of harmonic oscillator potential must have a nonzero momentum due to uncertainty principle. Correspondingly its energy should be nonzero. Similar phenomenon takes place in quantum field theory because any quantized field can be represented as a collection of oscillators with all possible frequencies. Correspondingly the ground state energy of this system is given by the expression:

[formula]

Here m is the mass of the field, gs is the number of spin states of the field and it is assumed that the field in question is a bosonic one.

One cannot live in the world with infinitely big vacuum energy, so Zeldovich assumed that bosonic vacuum energy should be compensated by vacuum energy of fermionic fields. Indeed, vacuum energy of fermions is shifted down below zero and is given by exactly the same integral as ([\ref=rhob]) but with the opposite sign. (This is related to the condition that bosons are quantized with commutators while fermions are quantized with anti-commutators.) So, if there is a symmetry between bosons and fermions such that for each bosonic state there exists a fermionic state with the same mass and vice versa, then the energy of vacuum fluctuations of bosons and fermions would be exactly compensated, giving zero net result. This assertion [\cite=ybz] was made before the the pioneering works on supersymmetry [\cite=gl] [\cite=va] [\cite=wz] were published. However, since supersymmetry is not exact this compensation is not complete (see the next Section).

Sources of Vacuum Energy

It is not excluded experimentally that the number of fermionic and bosonic species in Nature are the same. Moreover it is practically a necessity, because otherwise vacuum energy density would be infinite. Still the masses of bosons and corresponding fermions are different and, with arbitrary relations between their masses, only the leading term, which diverges as the fourth power of the integration limit, would be canceled out. However in some supersymmetric theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking there may be specific relations between masses of different fields which ensure the compensation not only of the leading term but also quadratically and logarithmically divergent terms. This looks as a very strong argument in favor of such models. However the finite terms are not compensated. Moreover in global supersymmetric theories finite contributions into ρvac must be nonzero and by the order of magnitude they are equal to

[formula]

where msusy is the scale of supersymmetry breaking. It is known from experiment that msusy  ≥  100 GeV. Correspondingly ρ(susy)vac  ≥  108 GeV, i.e. 55 orders of magnitude larger than the permitted upper bound. In more advanced supersymmetric theories which include gravity (the so called supergravity or local supersymmetry) the condition of non-vanishing vacuum energy in the broken symmetry phase is not obligatory. However, if one does not take a special care, the value of vacuum energy in unbroken supergravity models is typically about m4Pl  ≈  1076 GeV. One can choose in principle the parameters in such a way that this contribution into ρvac is compensated down to zero with the accuracy 10- 123 but this demands a fantastic fine-tuning.

One more source of vacuum energy is the energy of the scalar (Higgs) field in the theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The potential of such field is typically of the form:

[formula]

This potential has minimum at φ2  =  m2 / 2λ  ≠  0. At nonzero temperatures it acquires corrections of the form ~  T2φ2 so at sufficiently high T the minimum of the potential shifts to φ  =  0. Thus, in the early universe the ground state in such a theory was at φ = 0 and in the course of the universe cooling down a phase transition [\cite=kir] [\cite=kl] took place to the state with nonzero φ. The change of vacuum energy in the course of such phase transition is δρvac  =  m4 / 4λ. Accordingly the electroweak phase transition contributes about 1010  GeV4 into ρvac and the grand unification one gives more than 1060  GeV4.

One could argue that these phase transitions are manifestations of high energy physics and who knows, if they existed or not. The vacuum energy might be adjusted in such a way that it is always zero in the broken symmetry phase when φ  ≠  0. This corresponds to the choice of the potential U(φ) ([\ref=uphi]) in the form U(φ)  =  λ(φ2  -  η2)2. So maybe these huge contributions into ρvac are just products of our imagination. However there exist some other contributions which, though smaller than the grand unification and even the electroweak ones, are still huge in comparison with 10- 47  GeV4. It is well known that vacuum state in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is not empty. It is filled by non-perturbative quark (or chiral) condensate [\cite=gm] and gluon condensate [\cite=svz]. The existence of these condensates is practically an experimental fact. Successful QCD description of hadron properties is impossible without these condensates. The vacuum energy density of the quark condensate 〈q〉 is about 10- 4  GeV4 and that of gluon condensate 〈G2μν〉 is approximately an order of magnitude bigger. Comparing these numbers with the upper bound ([\ref=upvac]) we see that there must exist something which does not know anything about quarks and gluons (this "something" is not related to quarks and gluons by the usual QCD interactions, otherwise it will be observed at experiment) but still this mysterious agent is able to compensate their vacuum energy with the fantastic accuracy of 10- 44.

The problem seems to be very serious and most probably demands new physics beyond the known standard model. An important feature that makes the solution of the problem especially difficult, is that the looked for modification should be done in low energy physics, corresponding to the energy scale about 10- 3  eV.

Possible Models of "Nullification" of Vacuum Energy

Several possible approaches to the problem of vacuum energy have been discussed in the literature, for the review see refs. [\cite=sw1] [\cite=ad1]. They can be roughly put into four different groups:

Modification of gravity on large scales.

Anthropic principle.

Symmetry leading to ρvac  =  0.

Adjustment mechanism.

A modification of gravity at large scales should be done in such a way that the general covariance, which ensures vanishing of the graviton mass, is preserved, energy momentum tensor is covariantly conserved, and simultaneously the vacuum part of this tensor, which is proportional to gμν, does not gravitate. This is definitely not an easy thing to do. Possibly due to this reasons there is no satisfactory model of this kind at the present time.

Anthropic principle states that the conditions in the universe must be suitable for life, otherwise there would be no observer that could put a question why the universe is such and not another. With cosmological constant which is as large as predicted by natural estimates in quantum theory, life of our type is definitely impossible. Still this point of view does not look very appealing. The situation is similar to the one that existed in the Friedmann cosmology before inflationary resolution of the fundamental cosmological problems has been proposed [\cite=guth].

There is one more difficulty in the implimenttion of the anthropic principle. Even if we assume that it is effective, there are no visible building blocks to achieve the necessary compensation of vacuum energy. One can say of course that this compensation is not achieved by a physical field but just by a subtraction constant or in other words by a choice of the position of zero on the energy axis. In other words it is assumed that there is some energy coming from nowhere, which exactly cancels out all the contributions of different physical fields. Though formally this is not excluded, it definitely does not look beautiful.

Probably the most appealing would be a model based on a symmetry principle which forbids a nonzero vacuum energy. Such a symmetry should connect known fields with new unknown ones. Some of those fields should be very light to achieve the cancellation on the scale 10- 3 eV. Neither such fields are observed, nor such a symmetry is known.

An adjustment mechanism seems to me the most promising one at the present time. The idea is similar to the mechanism of solving the problem of natural CP-conservation in quantum chromodynamics by the axion field [\cite=pq] [\cite=sw2] [\cite=wil]. The axion potential automatically acquires a minimum at the value of the field amplitude that cancels out the CP-odd contribution from the so called theta-term, θG. Similar mechanism can hopefully kill vacuum energy. Let us assume that there is a very light or massless field coupled to gravity in such a way that it is unstable in De Sitter background and develops the condensate whose energy-momentum tensor is equal by magnitude and opposite by sign to the original vacuum energy-momentum tensor. Though it looks rather promising, it is very difficult, if possible at all, to construct a realistic model based on this idea. Some of the existing attempts to do that, are discussed in the following three sections.

Adjustment by a Scalar Field

A scalar field looks the most natural for the role of the adjustment agent. This is why the first attempts to realize the adjustment was based on the hypothesis on a massless scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity [\cite=ad2]:

[formula]

Here ξ is a constant and R is the curvature scalar. Such non-minimal coupling is well known in the literature. In particular the condition of conformal invariance of a massless scalar field demands ξ = 1 / 6. We will consider the evolution of homogeneous (space-point independent) field φ in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background with the metric:

[formula]

For simplicity we assumed that it is spatially flat.

The equation of motion for massless minimally coupled (ξ = 0) scalar field in this metric has the form:

[formula]

where a(t) is the scale factor and [formula] is the Hubble parameter. Evidently this equation has only constant solutions or solutions decreasing in the course of the expansion.

If ξ  ≠  0 and the product ξR is negative, then it effectively behaves as negative mass squared and correspondingly the state with φ = 0 is unstable. Now the equation takes the the form:

[formula]

In the De Sitter space-time both the curvature scalar R = 12H2 and the Hubble constant H (which now is a constant indeed) are time independent and it is easy to see that for ξR < 0 this equation has an exponentially rising solution, φ  ~   exp (cHt), where c is a numerical coefficient. Thus if one starts from the state dominated by vacuum energy, Tμν  ≈  ρvacgμν, the universe would initially expand exponentially, a(t)  ~   exp (Ht). However fluctuations of the field φ would be unstable in this background and very soon the amplitude of this field would become large, so its influence on the expansion should be taken into account. One can check that asymptotically φ  ~  t and the exponential expansion of the universe turns into the power law one [\cite=ad2], a(t)  ~  tκ. Thus it seems that our goal is reached. We started from the De Sitter universe and ultimately came to the Friedmann one. However one can check that the energy-momentum tensor of the field φ is by no means proportional to the vacuum one, so there is no cancellation between them. The slowing down of expansion is achieved not by killing the anti-gravitating vacuum energy but by asymptotic cancellation of the gravitational coupling constant. Indeed, the curvature scalar enters the Lagrangian as (8πm2Pl  -  ξφ2)R. It means that the effective gravitational coupling behaves as

[formula]

So with φ  ~  t the gravitational coupling dies down with time as 1 / t2. This is not the solution that we looked for. Though the example itself is rather interesting, most probably it has nothing to do with a realistic cosmology.

There is quite a long list of papers where the attempts has been made to solve the problem of the cosmological constant along similar lines. A list of references, probably non-complete, can be found in paper [\cite=ad3]. All these attempts proved to be not successful. There is even a no-go theorem [\cite=sw1] which states that a scalar field cannot successfully solve the problem of adjustment of vacuum energy. Because of that we will turn in the next section to fields with higher spins.

Vector Field and the Adjustment Mechanism

At a first glance a condensate of vector or higher rank tensor field would destroy the observed homogeneity and isotropy of the universe and that is why the earlier attempts to realize adjustment of vacuum energy down to zero, were based on a scalar field. This is not true however, because space-point independent time components of these fields as well as isotropic components of symmetric tensor field, Sij  ~  δij, break neither homogeneity nor isotropy. Such condensates would destroy of course Lorents invariance of the theory but since such a field interacts with matter only gravitationally, the breaking of Lorents invariance would be at the same level as that induced by a choice of a preferable cosmological frame where cosmic microwave radiation is isotropic, and is not dangerous from the point of view of experiment. A theory of higher rank tensor fields opens reacher possibility than that of just massless scalar field and in particular presents a counterexample to the "no-go" theorem mentioned in the previous section.

In ref. [\cite=ad4] a gauge vector field with the usual kinetic term, like in the Maxwell electrodynamics, F2μν, was considered. Such field is stable in the De Sitter background. To induce an instability the coupling to the curvature, ξRU(A2μ), which breaks gauge symmetry was introduced. The model contains too much arbitrariness, connected with the choice of the potential U(A2), and gives rise to a time dependent gravitational constant though the dependence can be much milder than in the scalar case, e.g. GN may logarithmically depend on time.

A more interesting model is based on the gauge non-invariant Lagrangian of the form [\cite=ad5] [\cite=ad3]:

[formula]

which contains only a simple kinetic term without any potential terms. The classical equation of motion for the time component At in this case has an unstable solution and with the proper sign of the constant η0 the energy-momentum tensor corresponding to this solution compensates the vacuum one. Indeed the equations of motion for the field Aμ in metric ([\ref=ds2]) have the form:

[formula]

[formula]

The energy-momentum tensor of this field is easily calculated from the Lagrangian ([\ref=la]) and is equal to:

[formula]

The Hubble parameter which enters equation ([\ref=d2tat]) is determined by the expression:

[formula]

where m21  =  m2Pl / 8π.

We will consider a special homogeneous solution: Aj = 0 and At = A(t). We assume that initially the magnitude of At is small and the expansion of the universe is dominated by the vacuum energy, [formula]. In this regime At exponentially rises, At(t)  ~   exp (0.79Hvt) and soon its contribution into the energy density becomes non-negligible. If η0  =    -  1 is chosen, so that the vacuum energy density and the energy density of the field At has opposite signs, the contribution of At would diminish H and both the expansion rate and the rate of increase of At would slow down. One can check that asymptotically At  ~  t and H = 1 / t. Expanding the solution in powers of 1 / t and assuming that ρvac  >  0 and η0  =   - 1 < 0 we find:

[formula]

[formula]

where c2  =  3m2Pl / 8πρvac and c1 is determined by initial conditions. The energy and pressure density of this solution are respectively

[formula]

and

[formula]

>From eq.([\ref=rhoat]) we obtain the following expression for the Hubble parameter:

[formula]

The energy density of normal matter, ρmatter, is added here for generality. Since ρmatter  ~  1 / a4 for relativistic matter, ρr, and ~  1 / a3 for non-relativistic matter, ρnr, the contribution of the usual matter into total cosmological energy density quickly dies down, ρr  ~  1 / t4 and ρnr  ~  1 / t3, and becomes negligible. Thus the result H   =  1 / t does not depend on the matter content and follows from the asymptotic rise of the field, At  ~  t. The total cosmological energy density in this model is dominated by the remnant of (ρvac  -  ρA)  ~  1 / t2. This cosmology is not realistic and in particular because the expansion rate, a(t)  ~  t is too fast. One can try to construct a model with a slower expansion rate using the freedom of adding new derivative terms into the Lagrangian:

[formula]

[formula]

However the first one gives exactly the same equation of motion for At as the Lagrangian L0 and the contribution from L2 into the equation of motion is just [formula]. It does not change the asymptotic behavior obtained above. So for a more realistic cosmologies one has to address higher rank fields. We will do that in the next section.

Let us consider now the contribution of the space components Aj into the energy density. It follows from eq. ([\ref=dt2aj]) that in the cosmological background with H = 1 / t the space components Aj increase as [formula] i.e. even faster than At, but the energy density of these components remain small in comparison with ρ(At)  ≈  const ([\ref=rhoat]):

[formula]

However since ρ(At) is canceled with ρvac down to terms of the order 1 / t2, the contribution of ρ(Aj) becomes dominant. Moreover the energy-momentum tensor of Aj contains undesirable non-isotropic terms proportional to AiAj or to [formula]. These terms can be suppressed if one adds the Lagrangian L1 ([\ref=l1]) with the proper choice of parameter η1. One can check that in this case the space components rise as [formula]. So for - 1 < η1  /  η0 <  - 1 / 2 the contribution of Aj into cosmological energy density would be small. Though the model of this Section is not realistic the tricks used here may be useful for more realistic models considered in the following Section.

One more comment about the cosmological solutions with At may be of interest. Let us assume now that η0 is positive, η0  =  1. Corresponding cosmological model in this case possesses a rather peculiar singularity. The equation of motion ([\ref=d2tat]) does not change and the field At remains unstable in the Robertson-Walker background but the behavior of the solution becomes quite different. One can see from eq. ([\ref=h2]) that the Hubble parameter H has a singularity during expansion stage at a finite value of the field amplitude and at a finite time. The solution near the singularity has the form:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and c1 and h1 are constant. The energy density of the field At at the singular point tends to infinity as (t0  -  t)- 2 / 3 while the scale factor tends to a constant value according to the expression a(t)  ~   exp [ -  3h1(t0  -  t)1  /  3].

Second Rank Symmetric Tensor Field

Essential features of cosmologies with higher rank symmetric tensor fields are the same as discussed in the previous section but some details may be different and in particular the expansion rate. Equation of motion for the space-point independent components of the second rank symmetric tensor Sαβ in the flat RW background ([\ref=ds2]) has the form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where stj  =  Stj / a(t) and sij  =  Sij / a2(t).

For η0  =   - 1 there exists a particularly interesting homogeneous solution of these equations which at large t behaves as Stt  =  Ct, sij  =  δijCt / 3, and stj = 0. The condition of vanishing of stj is not stable but its stability can be ensured in the same way as stability of space components Aj discussed in the previous Section. There may be non-vanishing components sij, which are not proportional to the isotropic tensor δij, but they rise with time slower than t. The energy density corresponding to this solution

[formula]

exactly compensates the vacuum energy density, as above in the case of vector field, but the expansion rate at large t is different:

[formula]

In this model a  ~  t3 / 8 and the energy density of usual matter decreases rather slowly, ρr  ~  t- 3 / 2 and ρnr  ~  t- 9 / 8. Corresponding values of the parameter Ω  =  ρmatter  /  ρc would be much larger than 1. Though the energy density of the usual matter may be the dominant one, the Hubble parameter, as above, does not depend on it. Using expression ([\ref=rhostt]) we find similarly to ([\ref=h2]):

[formula]

One can easily check that the asymptotic solution of the equation of motion Stt  ~  t and sij  ~  t gives the result ([\ref=3h8t]) independently of the energy density of the usual matter, ρmatter, and its equation of state. This is in a drastic contrast to the standard cosmology, when the expansion rate is determined by the usual matter, so for an agreement with observations a particular fine-tuning is necessary even if one manages to obtain a normal expansion rate. To achieve the latter we can use the freedom in the choice of the Lagrangian of the tensor field similar to expressions ([\ref=l1]) and ([\ref=l2]):

[formula]

Varying the coefficients ηj one can get different expansion regimes, in particular a(t)  ~  t1 / 2 or a(t)  ~  t2 / 3 which correspond respectively to radiation domination (RD) and matter domination (MD) expansion regimes in the standard cosmology. However this cosmological scenario has a serious problem which is related to the fact that the Hubble parameter does not depend upon the equation of state of cosmic matter. In particular it is not clear how to change the regime from RD to MD, how to satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraints, and many other constraints on the way of constructing a realistic cosmology.

Except for more freedom for realization of different expansion regimes there is one more advantage of symmetric tensor field in comparison to the vector one. Namely, quantum corrections for a non-gauge field generically induce a nonzero mass even if one has started with a massless theory. In the case of considered above vector field no principle is seen which could prevent from the quantum mass generation. For the symmetric tensor field there is symmetry of the Lagrangian with respect to transformation Sμν  →  Sμν  +  Cgμν with an arbitrary constant C. This symmetry does not permit to generate mass terms by quantum corrections.

Conclusion

The models described above have at least a partial success in solving the mystery of vacuum energy. We started with dominated by cosmological term De Sitter universe, which expanded exponentially, and came to the Friedmann type universe, which expanded as a power of time. The energy-momentum tensors of the classically unstable condensates of the vector or tensor fields asymptotically tend to the vacuum one (with the opposite sign), so that the vacuum energy is canceled out in accordance with our expectations.

Unfortunately there are still quite many serious problems on the road to a realistic cosmology. The most serious one is mentioned at the end of the previous section, that the expansion regime is not related to the matter content in the universe. It is determined by the new fields and in this new cosmology there should be a new fine-tuning, which makes the density of the usual matter so close to the critical one.

If despite all these shortcomings the solution to the problem of vacuum energy is achieved by the compensating field, it seems then that all such theories have the generic feature that there is always a remnant of non-compensated vacuum energy density which is close to the critical one. Correspondingly at all stages of the universe evolution the role of cosmological constant should be essential. It looks like a model with a time-varying cosmological constant [\cite=ad2] which always, during nucleosynthesis, at the onset of structure formation, and now, is 100% essential. In these frameworks the problem is why the traditional cosmology describes observations so well.

There are also quite serious problems associated with the theory of (massless) non-gauged vector or tensor fields especially in its quantized version. Usually a theory of high spin field is formulated in such a way that lower spin components are suppressed by an additional condition. In the models which are considered here the condition is opposite, namely we have to exclude the highest spin component in the theory. It is an open question if such a theory may be formulated in self-consistent way. Still, keeping in mind the gravity of the cosmological constant problem, maybe the price paid here for its possible solution is not too high.
