on the axion decays

Various extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are the subject of constant theoretical and experimental investigations. The existence of such particles would be a low-energy manifestation of new physics at energy scales much larger than can be probed in the laboratory and they could play an important role in astrophysics and cosmology.

In this work we present some of our results concerning the decays of the most widely discussed pseudo-Goldstone boson, the axion [\cite=P1] [\cite=WW], associated with Peccei-Quinn PQ-symmetry (see, for example [\cite=P2] [\cite=P3]).

The allowed range for the axion mass, and therefore for the PQ-symmetry breaking scale, fa, is strongly constrained by astrophysical and cosmological considerations [\cite=P3] [\cite=Raf1] [\cite=Tur] which leave a rather narrow window :

[formula]

The upper bound on ma arises from astrophysical arguments because axion emission removes energy from stars altering their evolution. If the axion has a mass near the lower limit, then axions play a very important role in the Universe and could be the Universe's cold dark matter. A survey of various processes involving weakly coupled particles production and astrophysical methods for obtaining constraints on the parameters of axion models is given in a wonderful book by Raffelt [\cite=Raf3].

Despite constant theoretical and experimental interest to the axion all attempts of its experimental detection have not a success yet. It can be naturally explained by the fact that axions are very light, very weakly interacting (coupling constant ~  f- 1a) and very long living. The axion lifetime in vacuum is gigantic one:

[formula]

On the other hand, investigations in strong external electromagnetic fields become of principal interest in astrophysics and cosmology of the early Universe in that they can be effective in getting new limits on weakly coupled particles parameters. At present by strong magnetic fields we mean the fields of strength of order and more the critical, so called, Schwinger value B  >  Be, Be  =  m2e / e≃0.44  ·  1014  G. It should be noted that by now astrophysical knowledge of strong magnetic fields which can be realized in the nature have changed essentially. At present the field strengths inside the astrophysical objects as high as 1015  ÷  1017G [\cite=B-K] are discussed.

It is known that an external field can catalyze substantially the decay processes. For example, in our recent work [\cite=L1] we have studied a double radiative axion decay a  →  γγ in the external field. The effect of significant enhancement of the decay probability by the field was discovered, namely, the field removes the main suppression caused by the smallness of the axion mass. To illustrate this we present here the comparison of the decay probability we have obtained with the one in vacuum:

[formula]

Here cos 2β determines the electron Yukawa coupling [formula] in the DFSZ model [\cite=DFSZ]; P(χ) is the function of the field dynamical parameter. Notice that this result (the strong catalyzing influence of the field) wasn't curious or unexpected one. In our previous works [\cite=L2] we have studied the other loop process, namely, the neutrino radiative decay in external electromagnetic field of various configurations and found the analogous phenomenon. Unfortunately despite such an enhancement the axion lifetime in this decay the field remains the big one.

The other special feature of the external field influence is that the field can open new channels forbidden in vacuum (for example, the well known photon splitting into electron-positron pair γ  →  e+e- [\cite=Klep] and into two photons γ  →  γγ [\cite=Adl]).

A tree level axion decay into charged fermion-antifermion pair a  →  f is one of the processes which is forbidden in vacuum when ma  <  2mf and opened in the magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the kinematics of a charged particle in a magnetic field is that which allows to have both time-like and space-like total momentum for the charged fermion-antifermion pair. For this reason this process becomes possible in the magnetic field even for massless pseudoscalar particle as it occurs in photon splitting γ  →  e+e-.

An amplitude of this decay can be immediately obtained from the Lagrangian of axion-fermion interaction:

[formula]

using the known solutions of the Dirac equation in a magnetic field. Here gaf  =  Cfmf / fa is a dimensionless coupling constant, Cf is a model-dependent factor, mf is a fermion mass. To obtain the decay probability one has to carry out a non-trivial integration over the phase space of the fermion pair taking the specific kinematics of charged particles in the magnetic field into account.

However the decay probability can be obtained by another easier way. It is known, that the decay probability of a  →  f is connected with the imaginary part of the amplitude of the a  →  f  →  a transition via the fermion loop by the unitarity relation:

[formula]

In the second order of the perturbation theory the field-induced part of Ma  →  a can be presented in the form:

[formula]

where [formula]; ef  =  eQf, e  >  0 is the elementary charge, Qf is a relative fermion charge; Fαβ is the external magnetic field tensor ((qFFq)  =  qμFμνFνρqρ, (FF)  =  FμνFνμ); Ea is the energy of the decaying axion; θ is the angle between the vectors of the magnetic field strength [formula] and the momentum of the axion [formula]. We stress that in order to obtain the correct expression for Ma  →  a one has to use a derivative nature of the axion-fermion interaction Lagrangian ([\ref=eq:L]) as it was first emphasized by Raffelt and Seckel [\cite=Raf4].

Here we present the results of our calculations in a more intersting limiting case, [formula], when the charged fermion-antifermion pair can be born only in the states corresponding to the lowest Landau level. This becomes possible if the high energy axion propagates almost along the magnetic field strength vector sin 2θ  ~  4m2f  /  E2a, so E2a sin 2θ  ~  4m2f  <  |efB|. The decay probability has the form:

[formula]

Here the factor ρ is introduced which takes into account a possible influence of the medium on the axion decay (ρ  =  1 when the medium is absent):

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function of fermion at a temperature T, μ is the chemical potential, [formula] is the distribution function of antifermions.

The expression for the lifetime is:

[formula]

As it follows from Eq. ([\ref=eq:T1]), the axion lifetime tends to zero under the kinematical condition: [formula]. Actually the expression [formula] has a minimal nonzero value due to the axion dispersion in the magnetic field:

[formula]

So, the minimal value for the axion lifetime is:

[formula]

Considering possible applications of the result we have obtained to cosmology it is necessary to take an influence of a hot plasma into account. It is known that such an influence is reduced to suppressing statistical factors in the integral over the phase space of the fermion pair. Under the early Universe conditions the hot plasma is nondegenerated one (μ  ≪  T) and the medium parameter ρ in ([\ref=eq:W1]), ([\ref=eq:T1]) and ([\ref=eq:TM]) is close to [formula].

The result we have obtained could be of use to re-examine the lower limit of the axion mass in the case of a possible existence of strong magnetic fields (B  >  Be) at the early Universe stage.
