Introduction

For a hypergraph H, the vertex set of the general Kneser graph KG(H) is the set of all hyperedges of H and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding hyperedges are disjoint. It is known that any graph can be represented by various general Kneser graphs. In this paper, we show that one can determine the chromatic number of some graphs, by choosing some appropriate representations for them. In view of Tucker's Lemma, an equivalent combinatorial version of the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, the present authors [\cite=Alishahi2015] introduced the altermatic number of Kneser hypergraphs. Moreover, they showed that it provides a tight lower bound for the chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs. Next, they determined the chromatic number of some families of graphs, e.g., Kneser multigraphs, see [\cite=2014arXiv1401.0138A].

A matching graph can be represented by the general Kneser graph KG(H), where the hyperedges of H are corresponding to all matchings of a specified size of a graph. It is worth noting that a Schrijver graph is a matching graph KG(H), where the hyperedge set of H is corresponding to all matchings of a specified size of a cycle. Hence, by determining the chromatic number of matching graphs, we generalize the well-known result of Schrijver about the chromatic number of Schrijver graphs.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=secnotation], we set up notations and terminologies. In particular, we will be concerned with the definition of altermatic number and strong altermatic number and we mention some results about them. Also, we introduce the alternating Turán number of graphs which is a generalization of the generalized Turán number. Next, we introduce a lower bound for the chromatic number in terms of the alternating Turán number. In fact, if one can show that the alternating Turán number is the same as the generalized Turán number for a family of graphs, then one can determine the chromatic number of some family of graphs.

In Section [\ref=secmatching], we study the chromatic number of matching graphs. In particular, as a generalization of the well-known result of Schrijver, we specify the chromatic number of a large family of matching graphs in terms of the generalized Turán number of matchings. Also, as a consequence, we determine the chromatic number of large permutation graphs.

Notations and Terminologies

In this section, we setup some notations and terminologies. Hereafter, the symbol

[formula]

Altermatic Number

The sequence [formula] is said to be an alternating sequence, if any two consecutive terms are different. For any [formula], the alternation number of X, alt(X), is the length of a longest alternating subsequence of nonzero terms of [formula]. Note that we consider just nonzero entries to determine the alternation number of X. However, for the simplicity of notations, we define [formula]. Let [formula] be a set of size n and LV be the set of all linear orderings of V, i.e., [formula]. For any linear ordering [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, define σ(j) = vij. We sometimes represent a linear ordering of V by a permutation, i.e., [formula], and we use interchangeably these two kinds of representations of any linear ordering. Moreover, for any [formula], define X+σ  =  {σ(j): xj =  + 1}  =  {vij: xj =  + 1} and X-σ  =  {σ(k): xk =  - 1}  =  {vik: xk =  - 1}.

For any hypergraph H = (V,E) and σ∈LV, where |V| = n. Define altσ(H) (resp. saltσ(H)) to be the largest integer k such that there exists an X∈{ - 1,0, + 1}n with alt(X) = k and that none (resp. at most one) of X+σ and X-σ contains any (resp. some) hyperedge of H. Note that if any singleton is a hyperedge of H, then alt(H) = 0. Also, altσ(H)  ≤  saltσ(H) and equality can hold. Now, set alt(H) =  min {altσ(H): σ∈LV} and salt(H) =  min {saltσ(H): σ∈LV}. Define the altermatic number and the strong altermatic number of a graph G, respectively, as follows

[formula]

and

[formula]

It was proved in [\cite=Alishahi2015] [\cite=2014arXiv1401.0138A] that both altermatic number and strong altermatic number provide tight lower bounds for the chromatic number of graphs.

Alternating Turán Number

Let G be a graph and F be a family of graphs. A subgraph of G is called an F-subgraph, if there is an isomorphism between this subgraph and a member of F. The general Kneser graph KG(G,F) has all F-subgraphs of G as vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding F-subgraphs are edge-disjoint. A graph G is said to be F-free, if it has no subgraph isomorphic to a member of F. For a graph G, define ex(G,F), the generalized Turán number of the family F in the graph G, to be the maximum number of edges of an F-free spanning subgraph of G. A spanning subgraph of G is called F-extremal if it has ex(G,F)-edges and it is F-free. We denote the family of all F-extremal subgraphs of G with EX(G,F). It is usually a hard problem to determine the exact value of ex(G,F). The concept of Turán number was generalized in [\cite=2014arXiv1401.0138A] in order to find the chromatic number of some families of general Kneser graphs as follows. Let G be a graph with [formula]. For any ordering [formula] of edges of G, a 2-coloring of a subset of edges of G (with 2 colors red and blue) is said to be alternating (respect to the ordering σ), if any two consecutive colored edges (with respect to the ordering σ) receive different colors. Note that we may assign no color to some edges of G. In other words, in view of the ordering σ, we assign two colors red and blue alternatively to a subset of edges of G. We use the notation exalt(G,F,σ) (resp. exsalt(G,F,σ)) to denote the maximum number of edges of a spanning subgraph H of G such that the edges of H can be colored alternatively (with respect to the ordering σ) by 2-colors so that each (resp. at least one of) color class is F-free. Now, we are in a position to define the alternating Turán number exalt(G,F) and the strong alternating Turán number exsalt(G,F) as follows

[formula]

and

[formula]

For a graph G, let F be a member of EX(G,F) and σ be an arbitrary ordering of E(G). Now, if we color the edges of F alternatively with two colors with respect to the ordering σ, one can see that any color class has no member of F; and therefore, ex(G,F)  ≤  exalt(G,F,σ). Also, it is clear that if we assign colors to more than 2ex(G,F) edges, then a color class has at least more than ex(G,F) edges. It implies exalt(G,F,σ)  ≤  2ex(G,F). Consequently,

[formula]

Next lemma was proved in [\cite=2014arXiv1401.0138A]. For the convenince of the reader, we repeat its proof, thus making our exposition self-contained.

The previous lemma enables us to find the chromatic number of some families of graphs. If we present an appropriate ordering σ of the edges of G such that exalt(G,F) = ex(G,F) or exsalt(G,F) - 1 = ex(G,F), then one can conclude that

[formula]

By this observation, the chromatic number of several families of graphs was determined in [\cite=2014arXiv1401.0138A].

Hereafter, for a given 2-coloring of a subset of edges of G, a spanning subgraph of G whose edge set consists of all edges such that red (resp. blue) color has been assigned to them, is termed the red subgraph GR (resp. blue subgraph GB). Furthermore, by abuse of language, any edge of GR (resp. GB) is termed a red edge (resp. blue edge).

Matching Graphs

In this section, we investigate the chromatic number of graphs via their altermatic number. First, in Subsection [\ref=subsecschrijver], we study the chromatic number of the matching graph KG(G,rK2) when G is a sparse graph. In contrast, in Subsection [\ref=subsecdense], we determine the chromatic number of the matching graph KG(G,rK2) provided that G is a large dense graph.

A Generalization of Schrijver's Theorem

Matching graphs can be considered as a generalization of Kneser, Schrijver, and permutation graphs. In fact, one can check that KG(nK2,rK2), KG(Cn,rK2), and KG(Km,n,rK2), are isomorphic to Kneser, Schrijver, and permutation graphs, respectively. Hence, as a generalization of Lovász's Theorem [\cite=MR514625] and Schrijver's Theorem [\cite=MR512648], it would be of interest to determine the chromatic number of matching graph KG(G,rK2). It seems that for any graph G, we usually have χ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2), but the assertion is not true when G is not a connected graph. For instance, note that χ(KG(nK2,rK2)) = |E(nK2)| - 2ex(nK2,rK2). In this section, we introduce some sufficient conditions such that the equality χ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2) holds.

A famous generalization of Tutte's Theorem by Berge in 1985, says that the largest number of vertices saturated by a matching in G is [formula], where o(G - S) is the number of odd components in G - S. For a bipartite graph, we define its odd girth to be infinite.

Let r  ≥  2 be an integer and G be a connected graph with odd girth at least g, vertex set [formula], and degree sequence [formula]. Moreover, suppose that [formula] and [formula] forms an independent set. If  degG(vr - 1) is an even integer or  degG(vr - 1) >  degG(vr), then [formula].

Note that [formula]. Hence, the aforementioned theorem can be considered as a generalization of Schrijver's Theorem [\cite=MR512648].

Let G be a connected non-bipartite k-regular graph with odd girth at least g, where k is an even integer. For any positive integer [formula], we have χ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - k(r - 1).

Matching-Dense Graphs

In this subsection, we determine the chromatic number of matching-dense graphs.

Let G be a graph with [formula]. The graph G is termed (r,c)-locally Eulerian, if there are edge-disjoint nontrivial Eulerian connected subgraphs [formula] of G such that for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, we have ui∈Hi and that for any u∈V(Hi), where [formula], we have  degHi(ui)  ≥  (r - 1) degHi(u) + c.

Let r  ≥  2 and s be nonnegative integers. Also, let G be a graph with n vertices and [formula]. If there exists an (r + s,c)-locally Eulerian graph H such that G is a subgraph of H, |V(H)| = |V(G)| + s, and [formula], then χ(KG(G,rK2)) = ζ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2).

Let G be a graph. A G-decomposition of a graph H is a set [formula] of pairwise edge-disjoint subgraphs of H such that for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  t, the graph Gi is isomorphic to G; and moreover, the edge sets of Gi's partition the edge set of H. A G-decomposition of H is called a monogamous G-decomposition, if any distinct pair of vertices of H appear in at most one copy of G in the decomposition. Note that if a graph H has a decomposition into the complete graph Kt, then it is a monogamous Kt-decomposition.

Let r,t and t' be positive integers, where 11  ≤  t  ≤  t'  ≤  2t - 2. If c is a nonnegative integer and t  ≥  8r + 4c + 2, then the complete bipartite graph Kt,t' is (r,c)-locally Eulerian.

For a family F of graphs, we say a graph G has an F-factor if there are vertex-disjoint subgraphs [formula] of G such that each Hi is a member of F and [formula]. Note that if a graph G has an F-factor, where each member of F is an (r,c)-locally Eulerian graph, then G is also (r,c)-locally Eulerian. In view of the aforementioned lemma, if a graph G has a Kt,t' factor, then one can conclude that G is (r,c)-locally Eulerian. Now, we introduce some sufficient condition for a graph to have a Kt,t' factor.

Graph expansion was studied extensively in the literature. Let 0 < ν  ≤  τ < 1 and assume that G is a graph with n vertices. For S  ⊆  V(G), the ν-robust neighborhood of S, RNν,G(S), is the set of all vertices v∈V(G) such that [formula]. A graph G is called robust (ν,τ)-expander, if for any S  ⊆  V(G) with τn  ≤  |S|  ≤  (1 - τ)n we have |RNν,G(S)|  ≥  |S| + νn. Throughout this section, we write 0 < a  ≪  b  ≪  c to mean that we can choose the constants a, b, and c from right to left. More precisely, there are two increasing functions f and g such that, given c, whenever we choose some b  ≤  g(c) and a  ≤  f(b), for more about robust (ν,τ)-expander see [\cite=MR3002574]. A graph G with n vertices has bandwidth at most b if there exists a bijective assignment l:V(G)  →  [n] such that for every edge uv∈E(G), we have |l(u) - l(v)|  ≤  b.

Let ν,τ and η be real numbers, where 0 < ν  ≤  τ  ≪  η < 1 . If n is sufficiently large, then for any robust (ν,τ)-expander graph G with n vertices and δ(G)  ≥  ηn, χ(KG(G,rK2)) = ζ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2).

The following lemma is an immediate consequence of Lemma 13 from [\cite=MR2644240]. In view of the previous lemma and Theorem [\ref=expandercondition], we have the next corollary.

For a positive constant γ, there is an integer n0 such that for any n  ≥  n0 we have the followings. If G is a connected graph with n vertices and the degree sequence [formula] such that that for each [formula], we have di  ≥  i + γn or dn - i - ⌊γn⌋  ≥  n - i, then χ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2).

For a graph property P, we say G(n,p) possesses P asymptotically almost sure, or a.a.s. for brevity, if the probability that G∈G(n,p) possesses the property P tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. For constants 0 < ν  ≪  τ  ≪  p < 1, a.a.s. any graph G in G(n,p) is a robust (ν,τ)-expander graph with minimum degree at least [formula] and maximum degree at most 2np. This observation and Theorem [\ref=expandercondition] imply that a.a.s. for any graph G in G(n,p) we have χ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2). Moreover, Huang, Lee, and Sudakov [\cite=MR2871764] proved a more general theorem. Here, we state it in a special case. In view of the proof of Theorem [\ref=expandercondition] and the previous theorem, we have the following result.

If 0 < p  ≤  1 and γ > 0, then a.a.s. for any spanning subgraph G' of any G∈G(n,p) with minimum degree at least [formula] we have χ(KG(G',rK2)) = |E(G')| - ex(G',rK2).

Let H be a graph with h vertices and χ(H) = l. Set cr(H) to be the size of the smallest color class over all proper l-colorings of H. The critical chromatic number, χcr(H), is defined as [formula]. One can check that χ(H) - 1 < χcr(H)  ≤  χ(H) and equality holds in the upper bound if and only if in any l-coloring of H, all color classes have the same size. Assume that H has k connected components [formula]. Define hcfc(H) to be the highest common factor of integers [formula]. Let f be an l-coloring of H such that [formula] are the size of coloring classes in f. Set D(f) = {xi + 1 - xi| 1  ≤  i  ≤  l - 1} and [formula] where the union ranges over all l-colorings f of H. Now, define hcfχ(H) to be the highest common factor of the members of D(H). If D(H) = {0}, then we define hcfχ(H) =   ∞  . We say

[formula]

otherwise, H is in Class 2.

For any integer r  ≥  2, there are constants α, β, and n0 such that for any graph G with n vertices, if [formula] and n  ≥  n0, then χ(KG(G,rK2)) = ζ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2).

Permutation Graphs

Let m,n,r be positive integers, where r  ≤  m,n. For an r-subset A  ⊆  [m] and an injective map f:A  →  [n], the ordered pair (A,f) is said to be an r-partial permutation [\cite=MR2892478]. Let Sr(m,n) denotes the set of all r-partial permutations. Two partial permutations (A,f) and (B,g) are said to be intersecting, if there exists an [formula] such that f(x)  =  g(x). Note that Sn(n,n) is the set of all n-permutations. The permutation graph Sr(m,n) has all r-partial permutations (A,σ) as its vertex set and two r-partial permutations are adjacent if and only if they are not intersecting. Note that [formula]; and therefore, for the simplicity, we assume that m  ≥  n for all permutation graphs. One can see that the permutation graph Sr(m,n) is isomorphic to KG(Km,n,rK2).

Next theorem gives a sufficient condition for a balanced bipartite graph to have a decomposition into complete bipartite subgraphs.

Now, we investigate the chromatic number of general Kneser graph KG(G,rK2) provided that G = (X,Y) is a balanced (|X| = |Y|) dense bipartite graph. In particular, we determine the chromatic number of any permutation graph provided that the number of its vertices is large enough. For more about permutation graphs, see [\cite=MR2009400] [\cite=MR2489272] [\cite=MR2202076].

For any positive integer r, there exist constants q and m such that for all n  ≥  m, the following holds. If G is a graph on 2n vertices which has a bipartite subgraph H = (U,V) with |U| = |V| = n and [formula], then χ(KG(G,rK2)) = ζ(KG(G,rK2)) = |E(G)| - ex(G,rK2).

Let m,n,r be positive integers, where m  ≥  n  ≥  r. If m is large enough, then

[formula]

Let s  ≥  t be positive integers and G = G(X,Y) be a connected (s,t)-regular connected bipartite graph. Theorem [\ref=grk2] implies that if s is an even integer, then for any r  ≤  |X| we have χ(KG(G,rK2)) = s(|X| - r + 1). This result shows that χ(KG(Km,n,rK2)) = χ(Sr(m,n)) = m(n - r + 1) provided that m is an even integer and m  ≥  n  ≥  r. However, if m is a small odd value, then the chromatic number of the permutation graph Sr(m,n) is unknown.

Let m,n,r be positive integers, where m  ≥  n  ≥  r. If m is even, then

[formula]

The aforementioned results motivate us to consider the following conjecture.
