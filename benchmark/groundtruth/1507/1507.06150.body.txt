THE BERGMAN KERNEL FOR INTERSECTION OF TWO COMPLEX ELLIPSOIDS

The Bergman kernel for intersection of two complex ellipsoids

Tomasz Beberok

In this paper we obtain the closed forms of some hypergeometric functions. As an application, we obtain the explicit forms of the Bergman kernel functions for intersection of two complex ellipsoids [formula]. We consider cases p = 6,q = r = 2 and p = q = r = 2. We also investigate the Lu Qi-Keng problem for p = q = r = 2.

Introduction

In 1921, S. Bergman introduced a kernel function, which is now known as the Bergman kernel function. It is well known that there exists a unique Bergman kernel function for each bounded domain in [formula]. Computation of the Bergman kernel function by explicit formulas is an important research direction in several complex variables. Let D be a bounded domain in [formula]. The Bergman space L2a(D) is the space of all square integrable holomorphic functions on D. Then the Bergman kernel KD(z,w) is defined [\cite=BE] by

[formula]

where {φj( · ):j  =  0,1,2,...} is a complete orthonormal basis for L2a(D). If D is the Hermitian unit ball Bn defined by

[formula]

It is easy to see that zα, [formula] form an orthogonal basis of L2a(Bn). A direct computation shows that [formula]. So the functions [formula], [formula], form an orthonormal basis of L2a(D). An easy computation gives:

[formula]

where [formula]. J.-D. Park in [\cite=Park1] compute Bergman kernel for nonhomogeneous domain

[formula]

for any positive integers q1 and q2. The goal of this paper is to give Bergman kernel for [formula] in cases when p = 6,q = r = 2 or p = q = r = 2.

Explicit formulas of hypergeometric functions

A great interest in the theory of hypergeometric functions (that is, hypergeometric functions of several variables) is motivated essentially by the fact that the solutions of many applied problems involving (for example) partial differential equations are obtainable with the help of such hypergeometric function (see, for details, ([\cite=Multiple], p. 47); see also other works ([\cite=H1] [\cite=H2], [\cite=OSS]) and the references cited therein). For instance, the energy absorbed by some non-ferromagnetic conductor sphere included in an internal magnetic field can be calculated with the help of such functions [\cite=LO], [\cite=NI]. Hypergeometric functions of several variables are used in physical and quantum chemical applications as well [\cite=MA], [\cite=SE]. Especially, many problems in gas dynamics lead to solutions of degenerate second-order partial differential equations, which are then solvable in terms of multiple hypergeometric functions. Among examples, we can cite the problem of adiabatic flat-parallel gas flow without whirlwind, the flow problem of supersonic current from vessel with flat walls, and a number of other problems connected with gas flow [\cite=Bers], [\cite=Fran]. Multiple hypergeometric functions (that is, hypergeometric functions in several variables) occur naturally in a wide variety of problems. In particular, one of the Lauricella functions

[formula]

Appell's functions F, F1 and F2 defined by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and Horn's function H3

[formula]

For function F1 we have the following integral representation (see [\cite=Edr])

[formula]

where [formula]. Picard has pointed out that F1 can be represented by a single integral in the form

[formula]

where [formula].

In [\cite=decH3] presented certain interesting integral representation for Horn's H3 function

[formula]

where [formula].

In this section we prove following recursion formula for

[formula]

Using well know fact (1)k = k! we have

[formula]

Next from [formula] we have

[formula]

After little calculation we obtain

[formula]

Now summing the m and p respectively in the second and third lines, we have

[formula]

Reversing the summation indexes, we can write

[formula]

which complete proof.

Now we calculate formulas in special cases.

For |x|  +  |y| < 1, |x|  +  |z| < 1 and y  ≠  0, z  ≠  0 z  ≠  y, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where P(x,y,z) = 2x9 + x6(2y + 2z + 3) + 2x3(yz + y + z - 6) + yz - 4y - 4z + 7, G(x,y,z) = x9 + x6(y + z + 6) + x3(yz + 4y + 4z - 15) + 2yz - 5y - 5z + 8 and Mtx = 1 - x3 - t.

If y = 0 then we have

[formula]

[formula]

where as before Mtx = 1 - x3 - t. In the case when z = y = 0, we have

[formula]

[formula]

If y = z and z  ≠  0 then we have

[formula]

[formula]

Using twice recursion formula for F8 function, we have

[formula]

Now using recursion formula for F2 (see [\cite=Park1] or more general version [\cite=Park2]), we obtain

[formula]

After some calculations using integral representation for F1 function and well known formulas [formula] [formula] and [formula] we obtain desired result. The proof for the other formulas in similar to above.

To prove Bergman kernel formula for domain D4 we need the following lemma.

It is possible that the following sum is represented by a hypergeometric function or is related to a combination of certain hypergeometric functions, but from the point of view of this work most interesting is its calculation.

For |x|  +  |y|  +  |z| < 1, |4w| < 1, w  ≠  0, w  ≠  z  -  z2 and [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula], and W2(x,y,z,w) = w(4x(x + y - 1) - 2yz - 5y - 4z - 2) - (x - 1)(x + y + 2z + 1)

Since Γ(a + 1) = aΓ(a)

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

By proceeding in a similar manner as in the case of the sum of S, we have

[formula]

Using the identity Γ(a + 1) = aΓ(a), after a little simplification, we obtain

[formula]

After some calculations, we obtain

[formula]

Shifting (changing) the summation index l, we have

[formula]

Sum out of l

[formula]

Using the following well know formula

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Sum out of m i n variables, we get

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Now analogous maneuvers for sum S2 lead us to

[formula]

Similar as in S1 case, we have

[formula]

Sum out of l

[formula]

Using the following formula

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Sum out of m and n variables, we have

[formula]

In S3 case, we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

After a little calculations, we have

[formula]

This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemd3].

Computation of the kernel

For Reinhardt domains it is a standard method for computing the Bergman kernel to use series representation, since we can choose [formula] Put Φα(ζ) = zα11zα22zα33. It is well known, that function f holomorphic in a Reinhardt domain [formula] has a “global” expansion into a Laurent series [formula], z∈D (see Proposition 1.7.15 (c) in [\cite=JP]). Moreover if [formula], [formula] then aα = 0 for [formula] (see Proposition 1.6.5 (c) in [\cite=JP]). Therefore {Φα} such that each αi  ≥  0 is a complete orthogonal set for L2(D1) and L2(D2). If D is a Reinhardt domain, [formula], [formula], then [formula] where [formula] (for proof see [\cite=JP] p. 67). Thus it is easy to check, that the set {zα11zα22zα33:α2  ≥  0,α3  ≥  0,α1  ≥   - 1  -  α3} is a complete orthogonal set for L2a(D3).

The proof of all above propositions is similar, and so we only proof [\ref=pr2].

[formula]

we introduce polar coordinate in each variable by putting z1 = r1eiθ1, z2 = r2eiθ2, z3 = r3eiθ3. After doing so, and integrating out the angular variables we have

[formula]

Integrating out of r2 and r3 variables, we obtain

[formula]

After little calculation using well known fact

[formula]

we obtain desired result.

Now by series representation of the Bergman kernel function, we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula]. Sum out of ν1 variable, we have

[formula]

Since Γ(α2  +  α3  +  4)  =  (α2  +  α3 + 3)Γ(α2  +  α3 + 3), that

[formula]

Finally using

[formula]

we obtain explicit formula for domain D1. Similarly we can obtain Bergman kernel for domains

[formula]

where p,q are positive reals numbers. Now we consider domain D2. As before by [\ref=pr2], we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula].

Using partial derivative notation we can write

[formula]

Now we can express above sum in F8 hypergeometric function terms separating α1 modulo 3.

[formula]

where [formula] for i = 1,2,3. After some calculations using explicit formulas from lemma [\ref=lem1] we obtain desired result. It is also possible in analogous way, compute Bergman kernel function for

[formula]

for any rational number r and for

[formula]

Now we consider domain D3. From Proposition [\ref=pr3], we have

[formula]

Sum out of ν1 variable, we have

[formula]

Sum out of ν2 variable, we get

[formula]

Finally sum out of α3 variable, we obtain the desired result.

In order to prove formula for domain D4 is sufficient to use lemma [\ref=lemd3].

Lu Qi-Keng’s problem

A domain [formula] is called a Lu Qi-Keng domain if [formula] for all z,w∈Ω. Obviously, a biholomorphic image of a Lu Qi-Keng domain is a Lu Qi-Keng domain due to the rule of the Bergman kernel transformation between two biholomorphic equivalent domains. A Cartesian product of two Lu Qi-Keng domains is a Lu Qi-Keng domain. If KΩ  ≠  const and Ω is the sum of an increasing sequence of Lu Qi-Keng domains Ωm, then Ω is a Lu Qi-Keng domain due to the Ramadanov theorem and Hurwitz theorem. However, it is not always easy to determine whether or not a given domain is Lu Qi-Keng domain. In 1969, M. Skwarczynski [\cite=SKWA] gave the first example that the Bergman kernel on an annulus in the complex plane Ω  =  {r  <  |z|  <  1} has zeros if 0  <  r  <  e- 2. Since the Bergman kernel for a bounded symmetric domain is a negative power of a certain polynomial, it has no zeros anywhere. In 1996, Boas [\cite=Boas1] proved that bounded Lu Qi-Keng domains of holomorphy in [formula] form a nowhere dense subset of all bounded domains of holomorphy. Since then the concrete forms of non-Lu Qi-Keng domains have been found in the various classes of domains in [formula]. The minimal ball [\cite=OPY] with n  ≥  4 and the symmetrized polydisks [\cite=NZ] with n  ≥  3 are not Lu Qi-Keng domains. For the complex ellipsoids, see [\cite=BS] [\cite=ZY]. The explicit formula of the Bergman kernel function for the domain D enables us to investigate whether the Bergman kernel has zeros in D  ×  D or not. We will call this kind of problem a Lu Qi-Keng problem. The motivation of this problem comes from the Riemann mapping theorem. If n  ≥  2, then there is no analogue of Riemann mapping theorem in [formula]. Thus the following natural question arises: Are there canonical representatives of biholomorphic equivalence classes of domains? In higher dimensions, Bergman himself [\cite=BE] introduced a representative domain to which a given domain may be mapped by representative coordinates. Let K(z,w) be the Bergman kernel for a bounded domain [formula], and define

[formula]

Then its converse is [formula]. Hence the local representative coordinate [formula] based at the point z0 is given by

[formula]

for [formula] In 1966, Lu Qi-Keng [\cite=Qi] observed the following phenomenon: It is necessary that the Bergman kernel K(z,w) has no zeros in order to define the Bergman representative coordinates.

The domains D1 and D3 are Lu Qi-Kengs domains.

Suppose that the Bergman function for D1 is zero at (z,w). It means that there exists z = (z1,z2,z3)∈D1 and w = (w1,w2,w3)∈D1, such that KD1(z,w) = 0. Then by Theorem [\ref=th1], we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Since

[formula]

then |ν3| < |ν1|. Hence

[formula]

from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, easily follows

[formula]

Hence |ν1|2  +  |ν2|  <  |ν1|, which is a contradiction with ([\ref=lu1]). In order to prove lemma for domain D3 is sufficient to use observation, that function defined by

[formula]

is biholomorphic between domains [formula] and D3.

It is well known fact, that Bergman kernel function for unit ball in [formula] is zero free. In view of the above lemma, we can ask the following question: Is there a relationship between the existence of zeros of the Bergman kernel function for domains
