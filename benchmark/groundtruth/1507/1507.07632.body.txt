Geography of Emotion: Where in a City are People Happier?

Introduction

Happiness is an intrinsic goal of human activity. Although people have been pondering for centuries about what leads to happiness and how best to attain it, it is only in the last few decades that researchers were able to study happiness empirically. Psychologists and economists designed surveys to quantify an individual's subjective level of happiness, subjective well-being, or satisfaction with life, which then allowed them to study how responses to survey questions are related to socio-economic and demographic factors. Using such data, Easterlin [\cite=easterlin1974does] famously found that high incomes correlate with happiness.

More recently, researchers explored the geographic and environmental factors that affect happiness. They found that proximity to amenities, such as the coast or major routes of transportation, lead to higher levels of subjective well-being, while proximity to a landfill negatively affects well-being [\cite=Brereton08happiness]. Such findings offer guidelines for city planners and policy makers for designing urban areas that promote happiness and maximize equity in the distribution of resources.

One drawback of the earlier studies is that they relied on questionnaires and surveys to collect data on subjective well-being and happiness. Such data are expensive to collect, and thus limited studies to small populations, obscuring small but significant trends. However, the rise of social media -- and location-sharing services in particular -- has given researchers an unprecedented access to geo-located data for studying the interplay between geography and happiness on a much bigger scale {and more precise temporal and geographical resolutions. Despite these advantages, social media data sources suffer from self-selection and demographic biases [\cite=Tufekci2014], and thus provide an alternative approach to survey data rather than a strict improvement. It is in the combination of different methodologies that we can derive new knowledge, rather than by using each separately and arguing about which one is best.

The microblogging service Twitter, for example, allows people to share short text updates with their followers and attach geographic coordinates to these posts. In addition, location-sharing services, such as Facebook Places, Gowalla, and Foursquare, allow users to simply announce their arrival to some place by "checking-in" to a "venue", which is a geo-tagged place identified by a short name. Users can either use an existing venue or create a new one. Users can even link their accounts across services, so that their Foursquare check-ins are announced to their Twitter followers or Facebook friends. Researchers have used these publicly available location data to study human mobility [\cite=Noulas:Foursquare2011], track people's movement [\cite=Cheng:Footprints2011], and explore urban land use [\cite=Quercia:Deprivation2015].

The availability of text on social media platforms also enabled researchers to analyze the sentiment of the messages and the emotional state of individuals posting them. Sentiment analysis has received much attention from the research community [\cite=Kivran:Network2011], since it allows people to monitor sentiment on a global scale [\cite=GolderMacy] -- an impossible task if one had to rely on surveys to measure people's emotional states [\cite=Quercia:Tracking2012]. For example, Kramer [\cite=Kramer:Unobtrusive2010] built a sentiment score for Facebook status updates and found that it correlates well with the self-reported satisfaction with life at the national level. Although Kramer's study suggested that one might be able to gauge a whole nation's subjective well-being and overall emotional health from the sentiment expressed on social media, it is not clear how sentiment varies on a micro-level, e.g., within communities or city neighborhoods. Eagle et al. [\cite=Eagle:Network2010] showed that the subjective well-being of communities strongly correlates with network diversity, where members of well-off communities have diverse networks while members of economically and socially disadvantaged communities have insular social relations. Alshamsi et al. [\cite=Alshamsi:Misery2015] studied the effectiveness of social media in mapping happiness at finer spatial resolution and found that happy areas tend to interact with other happy areas (i.e., homophily), although they did not use other urban indicators such as demographics or mobility [\cite=Cheng:Footprints2011] [\cite=Noulas:Foursquare2011].

In this paper, we combined social media data from Twitter and Foursquare with demographic data from the US Census to carry out micro-analysis of geography and emotion. Specifically, we used Foursquare check-ins to identify areas within a major US metropolitan area that people like to use. These are the places with amenities, such as parks, restaurants, public transportation, and gyms. We then analyzed properties of these places by looking at geo-tagged messages, or tweets, coming from those areas. We linked the tweets to US Census tracts through their locations. Census tracts are small areas that are relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. This allows us to link the sentiment expressed in tweets that are posted from different census tracts with those tracts' demographic properties.

Our results reveal that areas with many check-ins are different from other areas within the city. In particular, these areas have happier tweets, which also encourage people from other areas to commute longer distances to these places. These findings shed light on human mobility patterns, as well as how physical and environment influences human emotions that can be used to design smarter, happier, more equitable cities.

Related Works

A number of innovative research works attempted to better understand human emotion and mobility. Some of these works focuses on geo-tagged location data extracted from Foursquare and Twitter. Researchers reported [\cite=Cramer:Performing2011] [\cite=Noulas:Foursquare2011] that Foursquare users usually check-in at venues they perceived as more interesting and express actions similar to other social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Foursquare check-ins are, in many cases, biased: while some users provide important feedback by checking-in at venues and share their engagement, others subvert the rules by deliberately creating unofficial duplicate and nonexistent venues [\cite=Duffy:Foursquare2011].

The high availability of Foursquare and Twitter data transmitted from mobile devices has also been subject to human mobility research [\cite=Eagle:Sensing2006]. More specifically, some researchers used Radius of Gyration (rg) [\cite=Barabasi:Rg2008] to characterize and quantify human mobility. For example, Noulas et al. [\cite=Noulas:Foursquare2011] applied rg to conduct a large-scale study of user behaviour and Foursquare check-ins with 700K users spanning a period of more than 100 days. The study revealed users' temporal and mobility patterns (the majority of users moved between 1 and 10 km and expended 100 and 2000 minutes to do so) in urban locations. Usually, human mobility is measured at the individual's level of granularity, disclosing the users' profile as well as their personal mobility patterns, which potentially discloses information that the user may prefer to keep private [\cite=Alshamsi:Misery2015].

Other researcher used demographic factors and associated them to sentiment analysis to measure happiness in different places. For instance, Mitchell et al. [\cite=Mitchell:Happiness2013] generated taxonomies of US states and cities based on their similarities in word use and estimates the happiness levels of these states and cities. Then, the authors correlated highly-resolved demographic characteristics with happiness levels and connected word choice and message length with urban characteristics such as education levels and obesity rates, showing that social media may potentially be used to estimate real-time levels and changes in population-scale measures, such as obesity rates. Eagle et al. [\cite=Eagle:Network2010] built communication networks from phone records across the entire United Kingdom, cross-referenced it with Census data, and showed that members of well-off communities have diverse networks, while members of economically and socially disadvantaged communities have insular social relations. Quercia et al. [\cite=Quercia:Deprivation2014] [\cite=Quercia:Deprivation2015] used the Index of Multiple Deprivation (i.e., qualitative study of deprived areas in the UK local councils) to compute happiness based on small areas, providing promising fine-grained, micro-level results. Alshamsi et al. [\cite=Alshamsi:Misery2015] studied the effectiveness of social media in mapping happiness with finer spatial resolution and, similar to [\cite=Quercia:Tracking2012], found that happy areas tend to interact with other happy areas (i.e., homophily), although other indicators such as demographic data and human mobility were not used in their research [\cite=Cheng:Footprints2011] [\cite=Noulas:Foursquare2011].

Inspired by these related works but exploring alternative approaches, we propose to use US Census tract and demographic factors to study the Los Angeles County, a large and diverse metropolitan area, and link these data with geo-tagged check-ins and tweets. Our goal is to characterize differences between areas in Los Angeles that contain amenities, or venues that people check-in, to areas that do not. We compare the sentiment expressed in tweets that are posted from these areas and identify the physical and demographic factors that influence human emotions.

Data

We collected a large body of tweets from Los Angeles (LA) County over the course of 4 months, starting in July 2014. Our data collection strategy was as follows. First, we used Twitter's location search API to collect tweets from an area that included Los Angeles County. We then used Twitter4J API to collect all (timeline) tweets from users who tweeted from within this area during this time period. A portion of these tweets were geo-tagged, i.e. they had geographic coordinates attached to them. In all, we collected 6M tweets, of which 700K made by 24K distinct users were geo-tagged.

We localized geo-tagged tweets to tracts from the 2012 US Census. A tract is a geographic region that is defined for the purpose of taking a census of a population, containing about 4,000 residents on average, and is designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to socio-economic characteristics of that population. We included only Los Angeles County tracts in the analysis. A sample of the Los Angeles Census tract map is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:map].

Some Foursquare users link their accounts to Twitter, so that their check-ins will be visible to their Twitter followers. Such check-in tweets were automatically generated and had a specific format, e.g., "I'm at 1K Studios (Burbank, CA) http: /  / t.co / 3W5ymDM5EI", "I'm at Cafe & Bakery in Glendale, CA https: /  / t.co / IeHOY6Bbbz", "I'm at Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine - (West Hollywood, CA) http: /  / t.co / pGHsMVGE3v". We created parsers to extract the location and venue from these tweets. In all, we extracted 5,863 check-ins from 687 tracts around Los Angeles County. The tracts in Figure [\ref=fig:map] are colored by the number of check-ins within their boundaries.

Methods

The field of sentiment analysis [\cite=Pang2008] aims at developing tools that process text to quantify subjective states, including opinions and emotions. Early developments in sentiment analysis extracted opinions from text, coining the term opinion mining. Later research focused on emotions, applying both supervised and unsupervised techniques to infer emotional states from text. Two recent independent surveys evaluated different sentiment analysis tools in various social media [\cite=Gonccalves2013] and in a benchmark of datasets from Twitter [\cite=Abbasi2014]. Across social media, one of the best performing tools is SentiStrength [\cite=Thelwall2012], which also was shown to be the best unsupervised tool for tweets in various contexts [\cite=Abbasi2014].

SentiStrength quantifies the emotions expressed in text by applying a lexicon and taking into account intensifiers, negations, misspellings, idioms, and emoticons. We apply the standard English version of SentiStrength to each tweet in our dataset, quantifying positive sentiment P∈[ +  1,  +  5]andnegativesentimentN∈ in a way that is consistent with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) in psychology [\cite=Watson1988]. Beyond its accuracy, SentiStrenght has been shown to perform very closely to human raters in validity tests [\cite=Thelwall2012] and has been applied to measure emotions in product reviews [\cite=Garcia2011], online chatrooms [\cite=Garas2012], Yahoo answers [\cite=Kucuktunc2012], and Youtube comments [\cite=Garcia2012]. In addition, SentiStrength allows our approach to be applied in the future to other languages, like Spanish [\cite=Alvarez2015], and to include contextual factors [\cite=Thelwall2013], like sarcasm [\cite=Rajadesingan2015].

Research in psychology shows that emotional experiences contain components in more than two dimensions [\cite=Fontaine2007], calling for extended analysis that includes multidimensional aspects of emotions. When measured through text, emotional meanings can be quantified through the application of the semantic differential [\cite=Osgood1964], a dimensional approach that quantifies emotional meaning in terms of valence, arousal, and dominance [\cite=Russell1977]. The dimension of valence quantifies the level of pleasure expressed by a word, arousal measures the level of activity induced by the emotions associated with a word, and dominance quantifies the level of subjective power experienced during an emotion. The state of the art in the quantification of these three dimensions is the lexicon of Warriner, Kuperman, and Brysbaert (WKB) [\cite=Warriner2013], which includes scores in the three dimensions for almost 14,000 English lemmas. To quantify the valence, arousal, and dominance expressed in a tweet, we lemmatize its content and apply the lexicon to compute mean values of the three dimensions as in [\cite=Gonzalez2012]. Thanks to the size of the lexicon, we find emotional terms in 82.39% of the tweets in our dataset, producing a multidimensional measure of emotion aggregates as expressed through tweets.

Mobility patterns are well-correlated with demographics and individual's socio-economic status and is a current topic of academic research [\cite=Cheng:Footprints2011]. Studies of human mobility usually focus on either the small scale (e.g., travel modes of individuals' daily commutes) or the large scale (e.g., air-travel patterns to track the spread of epidemics over time). Some researchers adapted concepts from physics, such as the radius of gyration (rg), to characterize human mobility [\cite=Barabasi:Rg2008]. In this paper, we also use rg to quantify a Twitter user's mobility. The radius of gyration rg is the standard deviation of distances between the user's locations (given by geolocated tweets) and the center of mass of those locations. The rg measures both how frequently and how far a user moves. A low rg indicates a user who travels mainly locally (with tweets mainly concentrated in a small geographic area), while a high radius of gyration indicates a user whose tweets are spread far apart spatially. The rg for a user is defined as [\cite=Barabasi:Rg2008]:

[formula]

where n is the number of geotagged tweets posted by that user, and (ri  -  rcm) is the distance between a particular tweet ri and the user's center of mass rcm. The latter is simply the average location of all tweets.

Results

We first analyze the emotions expressed in tweets posted from different places around Los Angeles County. We find that places with many check-ins have tweets that express happier and less negative emotions. We then explore how demographic factors contribute to these observations.

Sentiment analysis

We use WKB and SentiStrength, described in Section [\ref=sec:method], to measure the emotional content of tweets. WKB quantifies emotion along three dimensions: valence, arousal, and dominance, while SentiStrength quantifies the positive and negative sentiment expressed in tweets. Note that values measured by WKB range from 1 to 9, with 5 being the neutral score [\cite=Garcia:Positive2012].

We calculated the mean values of positive (P) and negative (N) sentiment, as well as mean valence (V), arousal (A), dominance (D) of tweets from each tract. Figures [\ref=fig:senti] and [\ref=fig:warriner] show the distribution of the means of these quantities for all 1718 tracts for which we have tweets (All LA Tracts), the 687 tracts for which we have check-ins (Tracts with Check-ins), and the 101 tracts with more than three check-ins (Tracts with >3 Check-ins). Table [\ref=table:sentiment] reports the means of these distributions.

To determine whether the difference in the emotional content of tweets from all tracts is different from the emotional content of tweets from tracts with check-ins, we conducted the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, testing the null hypothesis that the means of these distributions are the same, and rejecting it only at confidence level of at least 95%. Comparing the distributions of means, we found that they are significantly different for all measurements, including mean P (p  <  0.01), N (p  <  10- 5), V (p  <  10- 7), A (p  <  0.01), and D (p  <  10- 6). Thus, although the differences between tweets from All LA Tracts and those from Tracts with Check-ins are are small, they are significant. This difference increases further as we filter out tracts with less popular venues.

Check-in locations in Foursquare can be freely created by users, which gives rise to much noise. Users often create fake, nonsensical, and idiosyncratic locations [\cite=Cramer:Performing2011] that no one else uses. To reduce the impact of such invalid locations on our results, we filter out tracts that have only 1 or 2 checks-ins. This leaves 101 tracts with three or more check-ins (out of 697 tracts with check-ins). The distributions of the mean emotion scores of these tracts are shown in the last column in Figures [\ref=fig:senti] and [\ref=fig:warriner], with the means of these distributions summarized in Table [\ref=table:sentiment]. We observe that Tract with >3 Check-ins have "happier" (higher valence) and less negative (less negative N) tweets compared to tweets from All LA Tracts or those from Tracts with Check-ins. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we found significant difference between the distributions of the means of N (p  <  10- 8), V (p  <  10- 7), A (p  <  0.001), and D (p  <  10- 7); however, we did not find a difference for P (p  <  0.1). These statistical tests lead us to find differences at a high significance level and thus reject the four null hypothesis above (the null hypothesis failed to be rejected only for P). Comparing emotional content of tweets across all tracts, a trend towards "happier" and "positively excited" emotional states can be observed for tracts that have more check-ins.

Why are tweets from tracts with many check-ins happier? To get insight, we look at the words that are commonly used in these tweets. Figure [\ref=fig:wordle] shows the world cloud of tweets from a single tract without check-ins and one tract that has many check-ins. The latter tract has words like "beach" and "playa" (Spanish for "beach"), in addition to "paseo" and "esplanade", which suggest pleasant places to stroll. While tweets from the first tract have "Shrine Auditorium", which is a popular venue for concerts, they have fewer words associated with pleasant experiences, such as going to the beach, or strolling with friends. Though deeper analysis is required, these results suggest place with check-ins offer pleasant amenities, such as the beach, that attract people to those areas.

Human mobility

Inspired by work such as [\cite=Barabasi:Rg2008] [\cite=Cheng:Footprints2011] and as detailed in Section [\ref=sec:method], we quantify Twitter user mobility by computing the user's "radius of gyration" (rg) such as in Equation [\ref=eq:rg], which represents the average distance between locations from which the user tweets. We aggregate these values to quantify tract mobility Rg as the average radius of gyration of all users tweeting from that tract:

[formula]

where rgi is the radius of gyration of the ith of N users who tweet from that tract. This allows us to compare mobility of tracts with check-ins. Figure [\ref=fig:rg] presents the distributions Rg for different sets of tracts we are comparing: all tracts in LA County with tweets, those tracts with check-ins, and tracts with >3 check-ins. Are these distributions different? The means of the distributions are: 191,925 meters for All LA Tracts, 241,261 meters for Tracts with Check-ins, and 295,057 meters for Tracts with >3 Check-ins. We conducted statistical inferences to test whether these distributions are the same at confidence level of 95%. These tests show that the means of these distributions are significantly different from each other (p < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons).

We conclude that people tweeting from tracts with many check-ins travel farther, on average, than other people in our data set. Moreover, users tweeting from tracts with more popular places (>3 check-ins) travel farthest distances. Two distinct mechanisms could explain this difference. First, people may need to travel longer distances to go to the places with more popular amenities. This would suggest that amenities that people want to use are not located equitably, forcing people to travel greater distances to use them. Alternately, however, residents of tracts with more popular amenities could have higher mobility in general (perhaps, they can better afford to travel). Although we cannot resolve between these mechanisms due to limitations of our data, doing so will have implications for city planners and land use designers.

Demographics

We next examine whether differences between tracts with check-ins and those without could be explained by demographics of their residents. For this analysis, we used four demographic factors: median age, ethnicity percentage, employment percentage, and bachelor's percentage by tract. Regarding age, the calculated average (median) ages are 36 years old for All LA Tracts, 37 for Tracts with Check-ins, and 38 for Tracts with >3 Check-ins. Since the differences between median ages are small and their distribution shapes are nearly normal, we conducted statistical inferences to test whether means of these distributions are the same at confidence level of 95%. Median ages differences between All LA Tracts and Tracts with Check-ins are different and highly statistically significant (p  <  0.001), as well as between All LA Tracts and Tracts with >3 Check-ins (p  <  0.001), whereas differences between Tracts with Check-ins and Tracts with >3 Check-ins are not significant. These results demonstrate that although the differences between median ages are small, still there is a important finding: residents in locations with check-ins and those with >3 check-ins tend to be slightly older.

Ethnicity is an important demographic measure. Big cities such as Los Angeles bring together people from all around the world and a variety of ethnic groups. For simplicity, we decided to focus on two different ethnicities: Hispanic and Non-Hispanic. Indeed, Los Angeles attracts many Hispanic groups due to its strategic position and border, which makes this city and interesting case study. In Non-Hispanic ethnicity tracts, the population mean is 2287 in All LA Tracts, 2744 in Tracts with Check-ins and 3379 in Tracts with >3 Check-ins. In another direction, Hispanic ethnicity tracts present a opposite trend in the population means: 2009 in All LA Tracts, 1653 in Tracts with Check-ins and 1113 Tracts with >3 Check-ins. Statistical inferences were also used to test whether means of these distributions are the same at confidence level of 95%. All null hypothesis were rejected when comparing All LA Tracts, Tracts with Check-ins and Tracts with >3 Check-ins population means for both Non-Hispanic and Hispanic ethnicities, which show the groups of populations are different with highly statistically significant results (p  <  0.001). Ethnicity results show that tracts with check-ins have high Non-Hispanic population and lower Hispanic population, suggesting that attractive amenities are located in places where fewer Hispanics live.

Another important demographic measure in cities is employment status of residents. US Census report the percentage of employed residents in each tract, and we use these values in our analysis. Results show that the mean employment percentage of All LA Tracts is 66%, while Tracts with Check-ins is 67%, and Tracts with >3 Check-ins is 69%. Since employment percentage distributions are nearly normal, we use the Wilcoxon rank-sum to test if these distributions are different at confidence level of at least 95%. While employment percentages differences between All LA Tracts and Tracts with Check-ins as well as All LA Tracts and Tracts with >3 Check-ins are statistically significant (p  <  0.001), differences between Tracts with Check-ins and Tracts with >3 Check-ins are smaller but still significant (p  <  0.05). These results show that Tracts with Check-ins and Tracts with >3 Check-ins tend to have higher fraction of employed population.

The last demographic measure we use is education, given by percentage of residents in a tract who have received bachelor's degree from a college or university, a master's, professional, or doctorate degrees. The bachelor's percentage means are: All LA Tracts 19%, Tracts with Check-ins 24%, and Tracks with >3 Check-ins (>3) 30%. By computing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at confidence level of at least 95%, we found that all null hypothesis were rejected when comparing All LA Tracts, Tracts with Check-ins and Tracts with >3 Check-ins bachelor's percentage means with highly statistically significant results (p  <  0.001). These results show that Tracts with Check-ins, as well as Tracts with >3 Check-ins, are more likely to have better educated population.

Complementing the analysis of results of this section, we also computed correlations between these four demographic measures. Employment percentage and bachelor percentage have a positive correlation (0.39), as well as bachelor's percentage and Non-Hispanic ethnicity (0.59), and bachelor's percentage and rg (0.50). A significant negative correlation occur between bachelor's percentage and Hispanic ethnicity (-0.75), as well as rg and Hispanic ethnicity (-0.46). Due to the positive correlation of Non-Hispanic ethnicity and bachelor's percentage, these results also suggest that tracts with better educated residents (higher bachelor's) tend also to have more employed and more mobile population. Tracts with higher percentage of Hispanic population also have less employed and less educated population, which also tends to be less mobile (lower rg). These correlations corroborate with the analysis of means and their respective statistical inferences results, as described above.

Discussions and Future Works

In this paper, we combined geo-tagged tweets, Foursquare check-ins, and demographic data from the US Census to carry out micro-analysis of geography and emotion. Specifically, we used check-ins to identify census tracts that contain amenities that people use and publicize their use of these venues through check-ins. We then carried out sentiment analysis of the tweets posted by Twitter users from these tracts. This allowed us to link the sentiment expressed by people in different places with the demographic properties of those places, as well as human mobility patterns.

We found that tracts with more check-in were happier places. Comparing sentiment scores of tweets from all tracts with tracts with check-ins, we observed a shift towards happier, less negative scores. We further filtered data to ignore possibly spurious or fake check-ins by removing tracts with fewer than three check-ins. We found that tracts with >3 check-in are even happier and less negative places than tracts with check-ins. However, the positive sentiment scores calculated by SentiStrength were not significantly different. This shows that including additional dimensions in analysis helps portray a more nuanced representation of emotional expression that is more robust with respect to fake content in social media.

Our results reveal that places (tracts) with check-ins are fundamentally different from other areas within the Los Angeles County. These places offer amenities that people like to use, such as restaurants, parks, beaches, and gyms. Indeed, population of tracts with check-ins (including >3 check-ins) tends to be slightly older, better educated, more employed, and more Non-Hispanic, compared to the population of Los Angeles County (all tracts). In addition, people tweeting from tracts with check-ins (and tracts with >3 check-ins) are more mobile, traveling farther, on average, than other people in our data set. This suggests that areas offering desirable amenities encourage people to commute longer distances to use them, although this observation may also be explained if residents of tracts with check-ins traveled more than other people.

Researchers have urged caution using when social media data, in particular Twitter, to study social science questions [\cite=Tufekci2014]. Twitter users may not be representative of the population researchers intended to study. Selection bias and other sampling effects could grossly distort the observations researchers make using Twitter data. Although we cannot eliminate all criticisms, we believe that our approach mitigates at least some of these concerns. Specifically, we conducted a comparative analysis of user populations. Since our analysis considers differences between populations, rather than populations themselves, it is less susceptible to selection and other biases, because these will affect all populations.

Despite this, there are still limitations of our data and analysis, which prevent us from drawing important conclusions from these findings. One fundamental issue is that we are not able to distinguish between residents and visitors to the area. While demographic analysis applies to residents, we have extended it to all people tweeting from the tract. Another concern is that Foursquare users are different, perhaps they are younger and better educated, so using them to select "attractive" tracts may skew the data. Further work is required to address these questions. However, even with these caveats, social media offers an intriguing data source for monitoring happiness in urban areas and exploring the questions of how happiness is connected to land use.

Future works should consider to include socio-economic factors, such as family income by census tract, to the study of sentiments analysis and human mobility patterns. Question on people's sociability within and between tracts, commuting preferences, as well as internet accessibility, should be considered for studying sentiments and mobility patterns in cities. Finally, for research purposes we suggest the application of the ideas of this paper to other cities and countries. We hope the findings described in this paper help researcher and policy maker in designing smarter, happier, more equitable cities.
