How Voltage Drops are Manifested by Lithium Ion Configurations at Interfaces and in Thin Films on Battery Electrodes

Introduction

Unlike pristine noble metal or graphite basal-plane electrodes used in classical electric double layer (EDL) studies,[\cite=text] [\cite=double] lithium ion battery (LIB) electrodes generally exhibit complex interfaces.[\cite=book3] [\cite=gross1] Both electron (e-) and Li+ transport can occur inside LIB electrodes. In addition, solid thin films, on the order 1-50 nm thick, are ubiquitous on LIB electrode surfaces and can become part of the EDL (Fig. [\ref=fig1]a-h). The EDL is critical because key battery processes like Li+ incorporation kinetics (including Li+ desolvation), parasitic reactions, Li-plating, and degradation-inducing phase transformations on electrode surfaces most likely initiate within it. Indeed, "solid electrolyte interphase" (SEI) films[\cite=book3] [\cite=xu] [\cite=verma] [\cite=korth] covering anodes are relied upon as kinetic barriers that prevent thermodynamic equilibrium in batteries; they are critical for LIB which operate outside the redox stability window of the organic solvent electrolytes used. As discussed below, the EDL is also crucial in computational work because it effectively determines the electrode potential (henceforth "applied voltage" or simply "voltage") in the simulation cell. Our work examines EDL associated with thin-film coated electrode surfaces, and emphasizes the importance of creating electrode interface models that exhibit consistent electrochemical activities for both Li+ and e-.

Examples of solid films on electrode surfaces include Li2CO3 layers formed on pristine cathode oxide surfaces;[\cite=aurbach2000] [\cite=saito2011] [\cite=song2004] [\cite=ostrovskii] cathode-coating films made of electrolyte decomposition products;[\cite=book3] [\cite=eriksson2002] [\cite=eriksson2002a] [\cite=kostecki] [\cite=novak] [\cite=lmo1] [\cite=lmo2] SEI films on anodes arising from reductive decomposition of liquid electrolyte components;[\cite=book3] [\cite=xu] [\cite=verma] [\cite=korth] artificial protective/passivating coatings,[\cite=dudney] including atomic layer deposition (ALD) layers[\cite=ald] [\cite=ald1] which can undergo phase transformations at low voltages;[\cite=alotrans] [\cite=ald_anode] ALD layers between solid electrolytes and electrodes in all-solid state batteries;[\cite=aldsolid] and even Li2O2 films deposited on cathodes during fast discharge of Li-air batteries,[\cite=liair] [\cite=liair1] the re-oxidation of which is accompanied by significant voltage hysteresis and is a root cause of the lack of a suitable liquid electrolyte in Li-air batteries.

Detailed atomic lengthscale understanding of the interfaces and EDL associated with such thin films has remained elusive, partly due to challenges in imaging buried interfaces at sub-nanometer resolution. Even EDLs associated with liquid organic electrolyte in batteries have arguably only recently received systematic experimental studies.[\cite=harris1] [\cite=browning] [\cite=leenheer] Modeling efforts have made much progress in elucidating the structures of solid-solid[\cite=sodeyama] [\cite=holzwarth2] [\cite=santosh] and solid-vacuum[\cite=meng] [\cite=greeley] [\cite=persson] [\cite=ceder] [\cite=islam] interfaces. However, voltage dependences, particularly in processes involving e- transfer like parasitic reactions and undesirable metal plating, have arguably received less theoretical attention. In this work, we apply electronic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how voltages affect the structures and stoichiometries of thin solid films, their interfaces, and their EDL at atomic lengthscales. In view of the complexities of LIB electrodes, we have adopted simple model systems. The liquid electrolyte is omitted, although a few solvent molecules are included as frozen monolayers in some models to illustrate their huge impact on the voltage. Au(111) surfaces are adopted as model cathodes, instead of transition metal oxides typically found in batteries. Au does not alloy with Li under voltages considered in this work and is a convenient inert electrode. These systems might be realized in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) settings; they dovetail with the use of copper[\cite=harris] and gold[\cite=bruce] electrodes in recent fundamental battery science experimental studies.

The model thin films examined in this work, in order of increasing complexity, are Li3PO4 (010) (Fig. [\ref=fig2]a),[\cite=holzwarth1] [\cite=holzwarth2] Li2CO3 basal plane (Fig. [\ref=fig2]b),[\cite=li2co3] [\cite=li2co3_dftu] [\cite=qi1] [\cite=qi2] [\cite=ouyang] [\cite=curtiss] [\cite=li2co3_surf] and LixMn2O4 (111) (Fig. [\ref=fig2]c).[\cite=persson] These are coated on Au(111) on one side and face a vacuum region on the other. Li3PO4 is a non-redox-active solid electrolyte. It illustrates the correlation between interfacial dipole densities and voltages. Li2CO3 is often found on as-synthesized cathode surfaces. In LIB studies, there is disagreement[\cite=saito2011] concerning whether Li2CO3 dissolves upon soaking in electrolyte,[\cite=aurbach2000] [\cite=song2004] is formed at high voltages,[\cite=ostrovskii] or is removed at >  4 V.[\cite=saito2011] In Li-air batteries, Li2CO3 is generally accepted to be oxidized and removed above ~  4.5 V.[\cite=liair1] Our goal is not to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism, but to study the electronic and structural signatures accompanying voltage increase. Redox-active LiMn2O4 (spinel LMO) is not used as nanometer-thick films in batteries, but its inclusion here helps illustrate the diversity of interfacial behavior (Fig. [\ref=fig1]). Like most LIB cathode materials, LMO is a polaron conductor because Mn can exhibit multiple redox states. It also conducts Li+, but is not a band ("metallic") conductor. By classical electrostatics definition, the interior of LMO is not instantaneously at a constant potential.[\cite=kanno] Our LMO/Au interface model provides a well-defined Fermi level (EF) to demonstrate how voltage control is achieved at atomic lengthscales, and how this affects EC oxidative decomposition on LMO surfaces.[\cite=lmo2]

Out of necessity, we critically examine the voltage calibration method used in the theortical LIB literature (Sec. [\ref=voltage]). The same experimental voltage governs Li+ and e- motion. Indeed, in cyclic voltametry, it is difficult to distinguish currents arising from Faradaic Li-insertion or parasitic processes that involve undesired e- transfer to the liquid. But what is "voltage" at atomic lengthscales? The absolute electrochemical potential for a charged particle in an atomic configuration is the (free) energy needed to transfer it into a given phase from infinity (see, e.g., Ref. [\cite=rossmeisl2015]). There can be differences whether the particle is a Li+ or a e-. In DFT modeling, the electronic voltage (Ve) governing electronic motion, and ionic voltage (Ve) governing Li+ motion, can and must be distinguished.

First we focus on Ve. Under constant voltage experimental conditions, potentiostats directly control the e- (not Li) content. When the phase is a metallic conductor with a well-defined EF, the voltage asociated with transferring e- from infinity, multiplied by the electronic charge, is equal to the work function (Φ) modulo a constant, just like in photovoltaics (PV)[\cite=brocks] and electrocatalytic systems.[\cite=gross] Φ=Evac - EF, where Evac is the vacuum level and EF is set to zero herein without loss of generality. If the electrode is immersed in liquid electrolyte, Φ calculated for the electrode covered by a sufficiently thick liquid layer, divied by the electronic charge, also gives Ve.[\cite=sprik] [\cite=otani08] Ve applies even under out-of-equilibrium conditions. It is readily computed in our model systems because vacuum regions exist and qualify as "infinity." In commercial batteries, there is no vacuum. Nevertheless, our focus on Φ is formally correct and emphasizes the synergy between batteries, fuel cells,[\cite=rossmeisl15] PV,[\cite=pv1] [\cite=pv] [\cite=nsai] [\cite=brocks] and metal-semiconductor interfaces.[\cite=tung1] [\cite=tung2] In those research areas, dipoles at interfaces are recognized as properties of paramount importance. At battery liquid-solid interfaces, EDL's are the manifestations of complex surface dipole distributions associated with applied voltages; it is in effect our computational potentiostat. Based on our calculations, we propose the manipulation of surface dipoles as a novel electrode passivating strategy (Fig. [\ref=fig1]b).

Li+ ions are only indirectly controlled by potentiostats; they slowly redistribute in response to changes in electronic configurations. We define the Li "voltage" (Vi) as the (free) energy difference between Li chemical potential in a system and the lithium metal cohesive energy per Li divided by |e|. This definition is widely used as the sole voltage estimate in the LIB theory literature.[\cite=licohes1] [\cite=licohes2] [\cite=ceder_review] [\cite=meng_review] At equilibrium, when the voltage is pinned at the redox potential of Li-insertion reactions, Ve must be equal to Vi. Thus Vi should be considered a self-consistent criterion at interfaces. By itself, Vi can give incorrect voltages when modeling parasitic processes induced by e- transfer, and it may not govern the dynamics of Li+ insertion processes adequately.

Fig. [\ref=fig3]a-d offers a preview of our results, pertinent to issues discussed above. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 discusses and reconciles different definitions of voltage in DFT calculations in more detail. Sec. 3 describes the methods used. The results are given in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 summarizes the paper. A supporting information (S.I.) document provides further details about our three model systems, compares the modeling of battery interfaces with geochemical[\cite=geochem] [\cite=geochem1] [\cite=multiscale] and other liquid-oxide interfaces,[\cite=adriaanse] [\cite=sodeyama1] and discusses Li2CO3 oxidation thermodynamics. Experimentalist readers are encouraged to skip to Sec. [\ref=results].

Voltage Calibration in DFT Calculations

DFT calculations are conducted at constant number of electrons, not constant electrochemical potential. Estimating and maintaining voltages in periodically replicated, condensed phase DFT simulation cells have long been recognized as a challenge.[\cite=sprik] [\cite=otani12] [\cite=otani13] [\cite=rossmeisl13] [\cite=rossmeisl15] [\cite=gross] [\cite=arias] [\cite=neurock] [\cite=norskov] Recently we have applied an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)-based Li+ transfer free energy method to predict voltage dependences of redox processes at interfaces between liquid electrolytes and lithium-intercalated graphite.[\cite=voltage] [\cite=vedge] AIMD has also been coupled with continuum approximations of liquid electrolytes to model constant voltage conditions on pristine electrodes.[\cite=otani12] But present-day AIMD simulation time scales are too short to extend to Li+ motion inside LIB electrodes or the surface films coating them except at significantly elevated temperatures. This work focuses on how applied voltages affect solid films.

Thus we model solid interfaces at zero temperature. With sufficient equilibration time and in the presence of Li+ and e- reservoirs, the total number of electrons (ne) and Li+ content (nLi +) in an electrode in a LIB are governed by the chemical potentials for electrons (μe) and Li+ ions (μLi +), respectively. EF of a metallic electrode is μe modulo a constant. Here we have not used μ̄e or μ̄Li +, the notations for total electrochemical potentials of e- and Li+,[\cite=text] precisely because constant-charge DFT calculations and terminologies are being applied to infer constant-potential electrochemical properties. Surface potential contributions to μ̄'s should naturally be present in our simulation cells, which feature explicit interfaces.

Electronic Voltage (Ve) from Work Function

The electronic voltage of an atomic configuration which is band conductor, imposed by a potentiostat, not necessarily at equilibrium with respect to nLi or the Li+ occupation sites, is defined as

[formula]

if the Li+/Li(s) reference is used.[\cite=borodin137] In the literature, values of 1.39 V and 1.44 V have been adopted; the small discrepancy is a measure of possible systematic error. In the DFT formulation, the e- configuration finds its ground state instantaneously. Ve pertains to infinitesimal changes in ne, which leaves the system uncharged. Note that Refs. [\cite=voltage] and [\cite=vedge] deal with Ve despite the fact that Li+ is transferred, because the excess e- is left on the metallic electrode at its Fermi level. As stated in Ref. [\cite=vedge], the free energy of that graphite edge-plane system has yet to be optimized with respect to the surface Li-content. In the present work, Ve are always reported for locally optimized atomic configurations so that all forces are zero.

Lithium Metal Cohesive Energy (Vi) for Voltage

In the "lithium cohesive energy" (Vi) approach, discrete and matched numbers of e- and Li+ are added/subtracted simultaneously:

[formula]

The last equality holds when the system approaches infinite size. Here E(nLi +,ne) is the zero temperature total energy after optimization of all interior degrees of freedom. The T = 0 K voltage is then given by

[formula]

where ELi(s) is the cohesive energy of lithium metal, predicted to be 1.57 eV using the DFT/PBE functional. No net charge is introduced. There is an ambiguity concerning whether μLi(nLi) should be E(nLi + 1) - E(nLi) or E(nLi1) - E(nLi - 1). We have chosen the latter definition (Eq. [\ref=mu_li]). μLi is used instead of μLi + to control nLi because the former is the widely used convention, and because it is harder to control charged particles due to the periodic boundary condition adopted. In the literature, Vi is generally averaged over a wider range of Li content than in the present work.[\cite=licohes1] [\cite=licohes2]

Ve and Vi are not necessarily equal. A transparent example is a pristine Li metal slab in vacuum. Vi=0 by definition. Yet the work function of Li(100) is reported to be 2.93 eV.[\cite=crc] This translates into an electronic voltage of Ve=1.51 V (Eq. [\ref=instant])! Indeed, if the Li surface is covered with a poor SEI that allows e- transfer but Li+ transfer is slowed to beyond experimental timescales - the opposite of what a good SEI does - the lithium slab acts as an e- emitter, the voltage of which must be governed by its EF. For Li(s) to truly exhibit 0 V vs. the LIB Li+/Li(s) reference in e- transfer processes, net surface charge densities and electrode-electrolyte interface contributions must be accounted for. Organic solvent decomposition can occur on uncharged Li (100) surface under UHV conditions despite the relatively high (1.51 V) potential, but in these reactions the metal surface is a reactant and Li+ are produced.

Relation between Ve and Vi

(1) Ve=Vi at equilibrium. Under this condition, Vi controls the Li content. Thus Eq. [\ref=relax] should be interpreted as a self-consistency criterion. μLi=(Φ-1.37 eV+1.57 eV) from Eqs. [\ref=instant], [\ref=relax], and the PBE estimate of ELi(s). Identifying Φ as μe, Eq. [\ref=mu_li] implies that μLi + becomes a voltage-independent 0.20 eV. This reflects that Li+ is in excess in an infinite reservoir. A related point has been made in the fuel cell literature.[\cite=rossmeisl15] In that case H+ concentration at the interface, governed by the pH, is also strongly coupled to the predicted voltage.

(2) When Vi  <  Ve, and the voltage is held fixed by the potentiostat, and Li+ and e- sources are present, the Li content should spontaneously decrease (as permitted by kinetics) so that Vi rises towards Ve. But Vi does not always increase with decreasing nLi. Going back to the lithium solid example: if the potentiostat is set at 1.51 V in solution, the entire Li slab dissolves. If instead an electrically disconnected Li solid is dipped into an electrolyte, some Li+ ionizes, leaving a negatively charge, possibly SEI-covered, Li surface. Now it is the electronic voltage Ve which decreases to 0 V vs. Li+/Li(s) to coincide with Vi.

(3) When Vi  >  Ve and the voltage is held fixed, the Li content should in general increase to lower Vi. This may not occur in all cases. For example, when all available Li+ insertion sites are filled in fully lithiated LiC6, the electrode becomes supercapacitor-like. Ve now controls the net surface electronic charge,[\cite=voltage] and Vi ceases to matter. Conducting simulations under such non-equilibrium conditions are crucial to understanding many phenomena in batteries. An example is the kinetics of metal plating[\cite=plating] [\cite=gross1] [\cite=zavadil] at overpotentials - an explicitly non-equilibrium phenomenon, a major safety issue in LIB, but also a critical process for batteries featuring rechargeable metal anodes. This discussion highlights the primacy of Ve when computing voltages.

Eq. [\ref=relax] was originally applied to bulk crystalline electrode simulation cells, and Vi has been identified as the redox potential.[\cite=licohes1] [\cite=licohes2] [\cite=zhou] Li should remain in the solid when the applied potential is lower than Vi. In these special cases of simulation cells without interfaces, the Li(s) cohesive energy approach (Vi) is neither consistent nor inconsistent with Ve. This is because the electrostatic potential at any point in space is only defined to within a constant in the interior of a crystal;[\cite=electr] therefore neither Ve nor EF is well-defined without specifying interfaces. Thus metals terminated in different crystal facets exhibit different Φ's.[\cite=marzari] Much more significant changes in Φ can be induced using adsorbed molecules.[\cite=brocks] Using DFT+U or hybrid DFT functional methods, Vi has generally been predicted to be in good agreement with measured open circuit voltages in bulk transition metal oxide simulation cells. The errors are at most a few hundred meVs.[\cite=zhou] This suggests that interfacial contributions may be small on most battery cathode surfaces. Our work suggests that artificial interfaces can be potentially be engineered to give larger, beneficial effects. Molecular adsorption effects will be emphasized in Sec. [\ref=li2co3_ec].

DFT calculations of interfaces are usually performed in finite-sized, periodically-replicated simulation cells kept at overall charge neutrality. In the literature, in DFT calculations without ions in the electrolyte (or without any electrolyte at all), the Vi approach has therefore assigned a wide range of voltages to LIB interfaces at charge neutrality. In other words, a continuous range of potentials-of-zero-charge (PZC) have been assigned by DFT. Yet simple "classical" electrodes such as pristine noble metals usually permit one PZC;[\cite=text] at voltages away from PZC, the surface is charged. If liquid electrolyte is present, the electrode surface can exhibit non-zero charges, compensated by counterions in the electrolyte. In this work, we illustrate this effect by adding PF-6 anions under UHV conditions.

Methods

DFT calculations are conducted using the Vienna Atomic Simulation Package (VASP) version 5.3[\cite=vasp] [\cite=vasp1] [\cite=vasp2] and the PBE functional.[\cite=pbe] Modeling spinel LixMn2O4 requires spin-polarized DFT and the DFT+U augmented treatment[\cite=dftu] of Mn 3d orbitals. The U and J values depend on the orbital projection scheme and DFT+U implementation details; here U - J = 4.85 eV is chosen to taken from the literature.[\cite=zhou] The charge state on Mn ions are determined from the approximate local spin polarzation sz reported by the VASP code; |sz|=3/2, 4/2, and 5/2 are assigned to Mn(IV), Mn(III), and Mn(II), respectively. For Li3PO4 and Li2CO3, most calculations exclude spin-polarization. A few spin-polarized calculations are performed to confirm that this is adequate. A 400 eV planewave energy cutoff and a 3×  3×  1 Monkhorst-Pack grid are applied in all cases. Increasing the cutoff or the k-grid changes the predicted absolute energies by at most 0.1 eV; energy differences, which are the relevant quantities, are much smaller.

Our model systems are asymmetric slabs: Li2CO3 basal plane, Li3PO4 (010), and LiMn2O4 (111) slabs on one side of 4-layer thick Au(111) (Fig. [\ref=fig2]). The standard dipole correction is applied to negate image interactions in the periodically replicated, charge-neutral simulation cells.[\cite=dipole_corr] Au is a metallic conductor and its EF is well defined. Work functions (Φ) are the differences between EF and vacuum levels. Two vacuum-surface interfaces exist per asymetric slab, and two vacuum levels, for bare and coated Au(111) respectively, are obtained.[\cite=brocks] Four layers of Au atoms do not give a completely converged Φ for uncoated Au(111). Therefore we have shifted the two computed Φ of each system by the difference between the predicted Au(111) Φ, and the fully converged Au(111) Φ=5.15 eV.[\cite=au_note] The shift is at most 0.1 eV. We also report the net surface dipole density (δ), which is the total dipole moment of the simulation cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface divided by the lateral surface area. The dipole moment is computed as the sum of all charges (including electron density defined on a grid) multipled by their displacement from a user-specified center of the cell, and is reported by the VASP code. δ should be independent of the cell-center in a charge-neutral simulation cell as long as the choice locates the artificial dipole layer[\cite=dipole_corr] inside the vacuum region. More details on the thin film models, and rationale for crystal facets chosen, are provided in the S.I.

Results

Au(111)/Li3PO4/Vacuum (Fig. [\ref=fig3]a for Summary)

First we examine the Ve of a non-redox active system: a thin β-Li3PO4 (010) solid electrolyte film on Au(111). We start with the stochiometric Li3PO4 slab with all Li+ sites occupied (ΔN(Li)=0, Fig. [\ref=fig2]a). The work function is Φ=4.23 eV. This translates into Ve=2.86 V vs. Li+/Li(s), which is reduced from the bare, charge-neutral Au(111) surface value Ve=3.78 V (Φ=5.15 V) by 0.88 eV. In the absence of Au, the Li3PO4 slab is symmetric and does not exhibit a net dipole moment. The fact that it modifies the Au Φ is not due to charge transfer between Au and Li3PO4. The spatially decomposed electronic density of state (DOS) (Fig. [\ref=fig4]a) shows that the phosphate Kohn-Sham valence band edge, located at about - 1.5 eV of the phosphate,[\cite=note7] is far from the Fermi level residing on Au orbitals. The Li3PO4 conduction band edge is higher than 5 eV and the vacuum level is at 4.23 eV (not shown in the panel).

Thus the stoichiometric slab must have induced image charges which set up surface dipoles. Indeed, the net surface dipole density (δ) of the entire simulation cell is predicted to be finite; δ=-  0.0048 |e|/Å, or -  0.023 Debye/Å2. The negative sign means that the dipole points into Li3PO4 from Au (111). Using

[formula]

where all quantities are in atomic units, this "small" δ should yield a large -  0.86 V shift between bare and phosphate-coated Au(111). This explains the -  0.88 V difference deduced from work function differences discussed above. DFT calculations give an aggregate δ, that includes screening, induced-dipoles, and depolarization effects, not individual contributions. Hence no effective dielectric constant is present in Eq. [\ref=delta].[\cite=tung2]

Under strictly UHV conditions, no net charge can be introduced. Net bulk or surface charges lead to infinite repulsive energies due to long-ranged coulombic repulsion. Instead, we raise the voltage by removing matched Li+/e- pairs, as is normally done in DFT calculations.[\cite=zhou] [\cite=greeley] The configuration space associated with removing multiple Li is large. We assume that Li vacancies are weakly interacting, and their formation energetics only depend on their positions in the z direction, perpendicular to the surface. Vacancies on the same layer of Li3PO4 are placed as far apart from each other as possible. With ΔN(Li)=- 4, two different configurations with all Li-vacancies right at the interface are indeed found to yield total energies within 30 meV of each other.

Removing one Li (i.e., ΔN(Li)=- 1) from the Li3PO4 layer in contact with Au is most energetically favorable (Fig. [\ref=fig5]a). It also gives the lowest Ve at this nLi content. The DOS there reveals no charge transfer between Au and Li3PO4 (Fig. [\ref=fig4]b). Some spurious Li3PO4 "orbitals" in contact with Au(111) are above - 1.0 eV, but they likely arise from the arbitary spatial decomposition scheme; the valence band edge should be taken as - 1 eV where at least two layers of Li3PO4 atoms exhibit the same orbital level.[\cite=note7] A net negative charge must remain at the Li-vacancy site, compensated by a positive charge on Au(111) (Fig. [\ref=fig1]e). This charge separation modifies δ to -  0.0029 |e|/Å  which should yield a voltage shift of - 0.53 V from the bare Au(111) value. Using explicit Φ calculations, Ve is found to rise to 3.28 V, shifted from the Au(111) Ve by -  0.52 V (Table [\ref=table1]), which is quantatitively explained by the change in δ. The phosphate valence band edge is raised by about 0.45 eV relative with EF on the Au surface (Fig. [\ref=fig4]b). Removing more Li at the phosphate-gold interface augments δ in the positive direction, increases Ve (Table [\ref=table1]), and raises the valence band edge proportionately (Fig. [\ref=fig4]c). Finally, removing a single Li inside the phosphate slab (Fig. [\ref=fig4]d) or at the phosphate-vacuum interface (Fig. [\ref=fig4]e) yields a larger Ve than if the vacancy is right at the Au(111) surface (Table [\ref=table1]). In the latter case, the phosphate valence band edge now coincides with EF.

So far we have not discussed the ionic voltage (Vi) governing the Li content. Table [\ref=table1] shows that Ve exhibits a significantly larger slope as a function of ΔN(Li) than Vi as long as Li are removed from the interior interface. The two voltage definitions should intersect at only one point. Ve approaches Vi between ΔN(Li)=- 1 to - 2. Away from that solid-state PZC, equilibrium (Ve=Vi) can be achieved with a net surface charge compensated by liquid electrolytes (Fig. [\ref=fig1]g, Sec. [\ref=li2co3_ec]), just like on noble metal electrodes. Models with non-equilibrium interfacial Li content are "wrong" in the sense that they only have transient existence.

Removing a Li sitting deeper inside the phosphate layer (Fig. [\ref=fig1]f, [\ref=fig5]b) shows signs of yielding self-consistency: Ve=3.78 V, Vi=3.69 V (Table [\ref=table1]). However, the relative free energy (ΔG) of this alternatve ΔN(Li)=- 1 configuration, evaluated using

[formula]

is less favorable than ΔN(Li)=- 3 where all Li vacancies are at the interface (Table [\ref=table1], fifth column), at a similar Li chemical potential (μLi=Vi). In general, if Vi increases upon successive Li removal right at the interface, Eq. [\ref=deltag] favors removing multiple Li there, rather than removing a single Li further inside the slab - even if the latter yields the same Vi. Thus Fig. [\ref=fig1]f should not be a candidate for equilibrium interfaces,[\cite=rossmeisl15] at least under these UHV conditions. If a liquid electrolyte is present, it cannot be ruled out that Li+ vacancy near the outer surface may be stabilized; we speculate that this could even yield a multitude of equilibrium Li+ configurations in Li-containing films, and therefore more than one PZC at different voltages.

Electrostatics-based Passivation Strategy

These results emphasize that the interfacial dipole density (δ) is one atomic lengthscale determinant of applied voltages. From Eq. [\ref=delta], a thin dipole sheet is expected to give rise to a step-like voltage drop at the interior interface of Li3PO4 (Fig. [\ref=fig1]e), which is therefore not an inert, passive coating (Fig. [\ref=fig1]d). At long enough times such that Li+ can insert and relax their configurations, this solid electrolyte should absorb much of the voltage drop/rise at the sharp metal/electrolyte interface. If a liquid electrolyte exists in the vacuum region of Fig. [\ref=fig5], it should experience a reduction in the extreme potential exerted by the cathode (Fig. [\ref=fig1]e), in effect widening the liquid stability window. Solid films coated on anodes should work analogously; in that case, the film, or at least its interface with the anode, must be able to incorporate extra Li.[\cite=maier]

The above discussions suggest a new design principle for "smart" artificial SEI passivating lithium ion battery anodes and high-voltage cathodes. Traditional SEI relies on Li+-conducting but e- insulating films to slow down e- tunneling from electrodes to organic-solvent based electrolytes. They are not designed to affect the voltage experienced by the liquid electrolyte, which thermodynamically speaking should still decompose at battery operating conditions. Our proposed scheme focuses on local thermodynamics, not e- tunneling kinetics.

A fast Li+ transport rate is crucial for successful implementation of passivation based on Li+-motion induced interfacial dipoles. Another route, not involving Li motion, is to incorporate permanent dipoles that can re-orient, such as ferroelectric films (Fig. [\ref=fig1]b). Ferroelectric surfaces have already been used to manipulate photochemical reactivities.[\cite=ferro1] Most ferrorelectrics are not Li+ conductors. However, electrostatic effects are long-ranged, and it is likely that non-continuous ferrorelectric films, lined with gaps that Li+ can pass through, can serve to reduce extreme voltages experienced by liquid electrolytes.

Au/Li2CO3/vacuum (Fig. [\ref=fig3]b) for Summary

The band alignment between Au(111) and the stoichiometric Li2CO3 basal plane (Fig. [\ref=fig2]b) is similar to that predicted for Au/Li3PO4. In the S.I., the Au(111)/Li2CO3(001) interface is also shown to be qualitatively similar. The broad correspondence suggests that the predicted behavior is universal for non-redox-active films.

The valance and conduction band edges of the ΔN(Li)=0 basal Li2CO3 slab bracket the Au Fermi level (Fig. [\ref=fig6]a), indicating no e- transfer. Vi associated with this Li2CO3 slab is predicted to be 3.53 V, very close to Ve=3.58 V there. Thus the PZC somewhat fortuitously occurs at stoichiometry. Next, we raise the voltage and try to oxidize Li2CO3.[\cite=saito2011] [\cite=liair1] by removing successive Li+/e- pairs. The most favorable Li vacancies are at the Au/carbonate interface (Fig. [\ref=fig7]a-b). As Li are further removed (Fig. [\ref=fig7]c, Fig. [\ref=fig6]b-c), Ve increases (Table [\ref=table2]). The valence band also rises until the occupied states at the Au/carbonate interface reaches EF (Fig. [\ref=fig6]d). At this point, e- transfers from Li2CO3 to Au(111). Oxidation under UHV conditions thus initiate from the Au/Li2CO3 interface. The redox reaction pins Ve, which ceases to increase with another Li removal (Table [\ref=table2]). This is reminiscent of "Fermi level pinning" at metal-semiconductor interfaces by surface/defect states,[\cite=tung1] except that in LIB the "defects" are mobile Li+ vacancies, not static impurities, and their density can be much higher. When 6 Li vacancies are created at the interface, Ve increases again. This may due to the complete removal of e- from some surface states. Unlike Li3PO4, the interfacial layer of Li2CO3 starts to lose structural integrity with removal of multiple Li+ (Fig. [\ref=fig7]c).

Removing one Li from the middle of the Li2CO3 slab (the hole remains on the Au surface) is less favorable by 0.25 eV compared to removing Li+ at the Au/carbonate interface. Removing a Li+ on the vacuum surface (Fig. [\ref=fig7]d) is less favorable by another 0.22 eV, and Ve=4.50 V, much higher than the most energetically favorable Li+ vacancy at the interior Au(111) interface. These configurations reveal an inhomogeneity in the energy landscape perpendicular to the interface that may strongly affect Li+ transport[\cite=santosh] - especially if Li+ has to escape from the interior interface to the outer carbonate surface to the liquid electrolyte.

Au/Li2CO3/EC/vacuum (Fig. [\ref=fig3]c)for summary

Next we use this Li2CO3 example to illustrate the impact of including explicit molecules in the theoretical models. A monolayer of adsorbed ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules is shown to exhibit profound effect on predicted voltages. Such molecular adsorption might be realized under UHV settings. We stress that frozen EC layers at T = 0 K cannot be considered adequate approximations of liquids at finite temperature.[\cite=interface]

Fig. [\ref=fig7]e corresponds to Fig. [\ref=fig7]a except for the adsorbed EC monolayer. The solid film atomic structure, energetics of successive Li removal (Vi, Tables [\ref=table2] and [\ref=table3]), and DOS (Fig. [\ref=fig6]a and Fig. [\ref=fig8]a, after shifting EF to zero), are almost identical with or without EC. This is unsurprising because the EC layer neither transfers e- to nor form a chemical bond with Li2CO3. However, this "spectator" EC layer leads to a large Ve decrease. They carry sufficiently large dipole moments, even when tilted almost flat in the adsorption geometry, to reduce Ve by >  1 V compared to vacuum interfaces.[\cite=delta_notes] At liquid-solid interfaces, thermal fluctuations should modify the δ value predicted for the monolayer EC in vacuum at T=0 K. Nevertheless, liquid EC at finite temperature has also been shown to change the PZC of the LiC6 edge plane by more than 1 V.[\cite=vedge] EC molecules are highly asymmetric; they bind strongly to cations, including Li+ ions at material surfaces,[\cite=borodin09] [\cite=voth] but weakly to anionic species. The resulting dipole layer decreases the vacuum Ve on both anodes and cathodes unless the surfaces are sufficiently highly charged to force reorientation of the molecules.

The DOS of Fig. [\ref=fig8]b may superficially seem to suggest Li2CO3 oxidation can occur at a very low Ve=2.31 V. However, Ve predicted with no Li vacancy is already lower than Vi computed for removing one Li. The correct interpretation of the first 3 columns of Table [\ref=table3] is that the Li content needs to increase in the direction of Ve until all Li-sites are occupied (Sec. [\ref=voltage]). It is inconsistent for (Li+,e-) pairs to be removed from the stoichiometric Li2CO3 slab when Ve=2.31 V. Therefore no oxidation occurs.

So far we have considered uncharged electrodes. If a liquid electrolyte is present, net surface charges can be compensated by mobile ions in the liquid electric double layer (Fig. [\ref=fig1]g). Fig. [\ref=fig7]f and [\ref=fig8]c represent a charged interface after replacing an EC molecule with a PF-6.[\cite=pf6_notes] The simulation cell remains charge neutral, and the - |e| charge must be largely compensated by a net positive charge on the Au(111) surface. This sets up an additional dipole moment, which increases Φ (Eq. [\ref=delta]). As a result, Ve rises to 3.53 V, very close to Vi under these conditions (Table [\ref=table3]). The DOS (Fig. [\ref=fig8]c) shows that, while the PF-6 valence band remains well below EF, some Li2CO3 orbitals on the outer surface has been raised almost to the Fermi level due to the close proximity of the anion. Although the extent of the surface charge depletion is difficult to quantify, Fig. [\ref=fig8]c suggests that oxidation may initiate at the outer surface of Li2CO3 in liquid electrolyte if PF-6 coordinates to the carbonate surface in an inner-shell configuration (i.e., they are in physical contact), and if the carbonate film is thin enough to allow electron transport.

A thicker carbonate film will increase δ at the same PF-6 surface density because of the larger charge separation. This means that fewer PF-6 ion near the surface would be needed to generate the same voltage increase (Eq. [\ref=delta]). We speculate that net charges on thick film surfaces are sparse and can be treated as isolated defects. The anions may also be farther away inside the liquid region and be screened by solvent molecules. As a result, the center of negative charge may or may not become more distant from the surface, and a quantative estimate of the effect of anion-surface separation on the voltage needs to be explicitly computed. Whether thin film-coated electrodes exhibit net charges compensated by counterions in the liquid (Fig. [\ref=fig1]g), or whether the voltage increase can be accommodated entirely by changes in Li+ configurations in the solid region (Fig. [\ref=fig1]f), depends on which option minimizes the Gibbs free energy.

Au/LiMn2O4/vacuum and Au/LiMn2O4/EC/vacuum (Fig. [\ref=fig3]d for Summary)

In previous work, we have considered EC oxidative decomposition on LixMn2O4 (100)[\cite=lmo1] and (111)[\cite=lmo2] surfaces, in both UHV conditions[\cite=lmo1] [\cite=lmo2] and in explicit liquid electrolyte.[\cite=lmo1] The liquid is found not to strongly affect the rate-determining reaction barrier on the (100) surface. The voltage dependence of EC decomposition was not considered there because LixMn2O4, like most transition metal oxides, does not have a readily-defined EF.

In this work, EF is made unambiguous by putting a thin, reconstructed[\cite=persson] LMO (111) slab on a Au (111) "current collector" (Fig. [\ref=fig2]c). Removing an e- from the system, without removing an accompanying Li+, does not immediately lead to a change in any Mn ion charge state, strongly suggesting that the e- is removed from the Fermi level straddling Au orbitals (not shown). This confirms that EF is relevant for voltage estimate via Eq. [\ref=instant]. Allowing geometry optimization after e- removal yields a localized hole polaron which is now in equilibrium with EF.

In contrast to Li2CO3 and Li3PO4, successive removal of Li+/e- pairs from the stoichiometric LMO slab occur most favorably from the outer surface (Fig. [\ref=fig9]a, see also the S.I.), not the LMO/Au interface. A Mn(III) turns into a Mn(IV) to accompany each e- removal. Table [\ref=table4] indicates that the voltage increases with decreasing surface Li content, and Ve=Vi is achieved at ΔN(Li)=-  2 under UHV conditions.

Next we add EC to the LMO surface. If the system were a liquid-solid interface, the surface Li content, net surface charge, and surface density of EC molecules which directly coordinate to available Li ions should be self-consistently deduced using AIMD simulations at finite temperature.[\cite=interface] Here we confine ourselves to T = 0 K and to adding one EC, yielding the surface used in Ref. [\cite=lmo2]. ΔN(Li)=-4 in this model (Fig. [\ref=fig9]b), and Ve=4.23 V, in reasonably agreement with Vi=4.19 V for this configuration (Table [\ref=table4]). The voltage is within the experimental LMO operating range. Except for the shift in Ve, and hence in the vacuum level, the DOS is almost unchanged from the case where no EC is present (Fig. [\ref=fig10]a-b). With no anion on the surface, the EDL structure should resemble Fig. [\ref=fig1]a.

It is also important to elucidate the EDL structure of a charged, polaron-conducting LMO surface, not considered previously.[\cite=lmo2] As in the Li2CO3 example, we impose a positive charge by optimizing the geometry of a PF-6 anion on the LMO surface in the overal charge-neutral simulation cell (Fig. [\ref=fig9]c). The DOS (Fig. [\ref=fig10]c) reveals that PF-6 retains its excess electron and is not oxidized.[\cite=pf6_notes] A net + |e| compensating charge is found in the LMO slab, on a second layer Mn ion ("Mn 14") below the LMO/vacuum interface. This layer contains Mn(II) ions, exchanged with Li+ in the Persson group's reconstruction,[\cite=persson] which may be the reason a Mn(III) ion there can lose an e- most readily. The dipole moment created by the Mn(IV)-PF-6 charge separation raises Ve dramatically, from 4.25 V to 6.41 V. Comparing the DOS with (Fig. [\ref=fig10]b) and without (Fig. [\ref=fig10]c) the PF-6, an occupied d-orbital on "Mn 14" is indeed seen to be depopulated; its orbital energy level now moves above EF. The EDL in this redox-active material now resembles Fig. [\ref=fig1]h. A lower surface anion density will yield smaller shifts Ve but will require a simulation cell with a much larger lateral surface area.

EC decomposition on LiMn2O4/Au surface

Finally, we re-examine EC decomposition on the ΔN(Li)=-  4 LMO slab, now with Au(111) present. Fig. [\ref=fig9]d depicts a partially decomposed EC molecule on this LMO surface. A H+ is transferred to the LMO slab without breaking any C-O bond in the EC. Its energy is +0.35 eV above the intact EC configuration (Fig. [\ref=fig9]b), in good agreement with that of the reaction intermediate depicted in Fig. 5c of Ref. [\cite=lmo2] where the Au slab was absent. A subsequent, C-O bond-breaking step is needed to render EC oxidation favorable.[\cite=lmo2]

Examining the spin states reveals that a Mn(IV) ion ("Mn 16") immediately below the oxide surface gains an e- to become a Mn(III). Consistent with this analysis, the DOS shows an unoccupied Mn d-orbital (Fig. [\ref=fig10]b for intact EC) becoming occupied (Fig. [\ref=fig10]d for broken EC), moving from above EF to below it due to polaronic relaxation.[\cite=mno_notes] Some orbitals on the decomposed EC fragment reside near EF, suggesting further oxidation can readily occur.

Regardless of whether an e- is added to LMO from an oxidized EC, or is removed by imposing a + |e| charge due to a counter-anion nearby, only Mn redox states change. Charge localization on Mn ions, accompanied by polaronic relaxation and a compensating PF-6 or EC+ fragment nearby, ensures that e- and hole never access the Fermi level which lies on Au orbitals (Fig. [\ref=fig10]). The Au current collector only serves to establish EF, with which polaron formation in LMO must remain in equilibrium. Therefore the effect of the applied voltage is indirect. Increasing Vi and Ve consistently requires the loss of surface Li+ (Table [\ref=table4]), which leaves the surface with more oxygen ions that are under-coordinated, and increases its reactivity towards EC molecules. Adsorbed PF-6 ions also increases the voltage.

Since Vi controls the Li content at equilibrium in this voltage range (Li-sites are not fully depopulated yet), one can arguably ignore both the Au slab and Ve while performing simulations of parasitic reaction on such redox-active surfaces.[\cite=lmo1] [\cite=lmo2] As discussed above, the same reaction intermediate energetics is predicted with or without the Au slab. However, Ve also controls the PF-6 surface density. Anions in proximity of the electrode surface constitute spatial inhomogeneities or "hot spots" where parasitic or Li+ insertion reactions may preferentially occur. Indeed, when a PF-6 is adsorbed near the EC, the deprotonated EC intermediate (Fig. [\ref=fig9]e) is found to be 0.1 eV more favorable than the intact EC, instead of 0.35 eV less favorable when the PF-6 is absent. Thus voltage-dependent anion adsorption can affect interfacial processes. If the cathode material is metallic rather than polaronic, the surface charge is more uniformly distributed,[\cite=voltage] [\cite=vedge] Ve is more relevant, and qualitatively different behavior may be observed.

Conclusions

Both electrons and Li+ can move in the surface films covering the electrodes in lithium ion battery (LIB), and in the electrodes themselves, in response to voltage variations. This makes LIB rather unique among electrochemical devices. The structures of electric double layers (EDL), and the atomic lengthscale manifestations of voltages, become much more complex than on pristine noble metal electrodes.

This work considers Au(111) slabs coated with Li-conducting solid electrolytes or cathode oxide materials under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions. The applied voltage is shown to be strongly correlated with the surface dipole density at the interface, reminiscent of photovoltaics studies. In relatively electrochemically inert thin films like Li3PO4 and Li2CO3 coated on Au(111), dipole moments responsible for voltage increase are established by creating negatively charged Li+ vacancies at the interface between cathode surfaces and the thin solid films, compensated with positive charges on the cathode. The phosphate example highlights the crucial role of dipole density. The carbonate case emphasizes that organic solvent molecules like ethylene carbonate (EC) can dramatically modify the predicted voltage even in the absence of charged species (salt). A corollary is that the Poisson-Boltzmann theory for liquid electrolytes, which ignores solvent dipole moments, may not quantitatively describe battery interfaces.

With LixMn2O4 (LMO) cathode oxide thin films coated on Au current collectors, charge transfer occurs at the outer LMO surface and involves changes in Mn redox states. The Au slab only indirectly determines the surface Li content and the anion surface density. Modeling of electrolyte decomposition on such electrode surfaces arguably does not require explicitly including the current collector. However, the voltage-dependent surface density of PF-6 creates inhomogeneities and hot spots where fast electrolyte decomposition can occur.

We also critically examine the definitions of "applied voltage" in DFT calculations at interfaces. We distinguish two voltages: electronic (Ve), due to electronic motion, and ionic (Vi), due to Li+ redistribution. In any atomic configuration, Ve is well defined in a metallic electrode and should coincide with the experimental voltage imposed via a potentiostat. Vi is a self-consistency critierion. At equilibrium, the system is pinned by Li+ insertion redox reactions, and Ve=Vi. It can be efficiently computed using the "lithium metal cohesive energy" method widely used in the battery theoretical literature, although most previous work neglects the possibility of net surface charges, compensated by ions inside the liquid electrolyte, which may affect parasitic reactions and Li+ insertion kinetics.

But out-of-equilibrium conditions are also critical to many battery-related phenomena such as SEI formation and electroplating. Here Ve, which governs electron content at battery interfaces, is the correct definition of voltage. However, the work function-derived definition of Ve does not fully account for spatial inhomogeneities. Our solid state modeling considerations form the basis for future AIMD simulations of thin film-coated electrode/liquid electrolyte interfaces.
