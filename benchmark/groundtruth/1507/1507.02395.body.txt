Equivariant smoothing of piecewise linear manifolds

Introduction

A topological action of a finite group on an n-manifold is called locally linear, if the local action of each isotropy group can be conjugated to a linear action on [formula]. According to classical results every topological action of a finite group on a 1- or 2-manifold M is locally linear (cf. [\cite=MR1309126]) and preserves a piecewise linear- and a smooth structure on M. On S3 there are wild topological actions for which none of these properties holds [\cite=MR0049549]. However, at least for actions on closed 3-manifolds it is known that these properties are still equivalent [\cite=MR948910]. This is not true anymore in dimension four. There are locally linear actions of finite groups on closed 4-manifolds that do not preserve any piecewise linear- or smooth structure [\cite=MR948910]. It has been conjectured though that every piecewise linear action of a finite group on a closed piecewise linear 4-manifold M preserves some smooth structure on M [\cite=MR948910]. We confirm this conjecture in the following stronger form.

A piecewise linear- and a smooth structure on a manifold M are called compatible with each other, if there exists a triangulation of M as a piecewise linear manifold all of whose simplices are smoothly embedded with respect to the smooth structure. Due to a theorem by Whitehead every smooth manifold M admits a unique compatible piecewise linear structure [\cite=Whitehead] [\cite=MR0198479]. An equivariant version of this result for smooth actions of finite groups on M holds by a theorem of Illman [\cite=MR0500993]. Conversely, any piecewise linear manifold of dimension n  ≤  7 admits a smoothing, i.e. a compatible smooth structure, which is unique up to isotopy for n  ≤  6 (cf. Section [\ref=sec:smoothing_theory]). In this paper we show that for n  ≤  4 piecewise linear manifolds can be equivariantly smoothed in the following sense, thereby confirming the conjecture in [\cite=MR948910].

In dimension higher than four the statement of the theorem is false, even without the compatibility condition (cf. [\cite=MR948910] or Remark [\ref=rem:counter_example] below).

It is always possible to find a piecewise linear triangulation of M with respect to which the group G acts simplicially (cf. Section [\ref=sub:pl_structure]). For n = 1 we can choose the lengths of the segments of such a triangulation so that M becomes metrically flat and G acts isometrically. In this way we obtain a desired smooth structure. The task of finding such in the case n = 2 appears in Thurston's book [\cite=MR1435975] in a slightly modified version as a "problem" and in the case n = 3 as a "challenge". Thurston asks for so-called canonical smoothings of triangulated piecewise linear manifolds, which are, in particular, preserved by simplicial isomorphisms. As a hint for the case n = 3 he remarks that one probably needs some "heavy machinery such as the uniformization theorem for Riemannian metrics on S2, used with ingenuity". The uniformization theorem implies that smooth actions of finite groups on S2 are smoothly conjugate to linear actions. The corresponding property for S3 is assumed in [\cite=MR948910] while formulating the above mentioned conjecture and has later been proven by Dinkelbach and Leeb [\cite=MR2491658] using Ricci flow techniques, thereby drawing on earlier work of Perelman and others on the geometrization conjecture.

Indeed, it turns out that the key ingredients for proving our main result are uniqueness of smoothings and the linearizability of finite smooth group actions on spheres up to dimension three. For our proof we specify the notion of canonical smoothings (cf. Definition [\ref=dfn:can_smoothing] and Remark [\ref=rem:thurston_can]) in a way that allows us to show essentially by induction on the dimension that piecewise linear manifolds can be canonically smoothed up to dimension four (cf. Proposition [\ref=prp:can_smoothing]). Here, essentially means that additional technical difficulties have to be handled in dimensions three and four in order to guarantee the compatibility of the constructed smooth structure due to the necessity of introducing simplicial subdivisions.

Preliminaries

Piecewise linear spaces

We recall some concepts from piecewise linear topology. References are [\cite=MR0248844] and [\cite=MR0350744]. A subset [formula] is called a polyhedron if, for every point x∈P, there exists a finite number a simplices contained in P such that their union is a neighborhood of x in P. An n-cell is a convex compact polyhedron that spans a subspace of dimension n. For a cell [formula] and a point x∈C the set [formula] is defined to be the union of all lines through x in [formula] that intersect C in an arc with x in its interior. If there are no such lines, then [formula] is defined to be {x} and x is called a vertex of C. Otherwise [formula] is an affine subspace. In general the cell [formula] is called a face of C and we write D < C. A cell complex K is a collection of cells in [formula] satisfying the following conditions

if C∈K and B < C then B∈K.

if B,C∈K then [formula] is a face of both B and C.

K is locally finite in the sense that for every cell C∈K and every point x∈C there are only finitely many cells in K that contain x.

The linear image of a cell is again a cell and the intersection [formula] of two cell complexes K and L is again a cell complex. The k-skeleton of K is the cell complex comprising all cells of K of dimension smaller or equal to k. A simplicial complex is a cell complex all of whose cells are a simplices. The underlying space P = |K| of a simplicial complex K is a polyhedron. Conversely, every polyhedron P in [formula] is the underlying space of some simplicial complex K. Such a complex is called a triangulation of P. We denote the k-th barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex K by K(k). The support [formula] of a point x in a simplicial complex K is defined to be the smallest dimensional simplex of K that contains x. The star [formula] of a simplex σ in a simplicial complex K is the smallest simplicial complex that contains all simplices of K that contain σ. The link of σ is defined as

[formula]

We write [formula] and [formula] interchangeably for the star and the link as a simplicial complex and as their underlying space. Also we sometimes omit the complex K in [formula], [formula] and [formula] if its meaning is clear. A subdivision of a cell complex K is a simplicial complex K' such that |K| = |K'| and every simplex of K' is contained in a cell of K. We have

Any cell complex can be canonically subdivided into a simplicial complex.

The 1-skeleton of K is already a simplicial complex. We successively subdivide the [formula]-skeleton of K. Assume that we have already subdivided the [formula]-skeletons of K. Then we star the (k + 1)-cells of its (k + 1)-skeleton at their barycenters, i.e. we replace each (k + 1)-cell by the join of its boundary with its barycenter. Having replaced the n-cells we obtain a simplicial complex that subdivids our initial cell complex.

A map f:P  →  Q between polyhedra [formula], [formula] is called piecewise linear (PL), if its graph [formula] is a polyhedron. A PL chart (P,φ) for a second-countable Hausdorff topological space X is an embedding φ:P  →  X of a polyhedron P. Two PL charts (P,φ) and (Q,φ) are said to be compatible if φ- 1(φ(Q)) is a polyhedron and [formula] is piecewise linear. A PL structure on X is a maximal family of compatible PL charts covering X. The space X endowed with a PL structure is called a PL space. In this way, one can define PL maps and PL homeomorphisms between PL spaces. A PL space X is called a PL manifold of dimension n, if for every point p∈X there exists a chart [formula] of X such that [formula]. Every PL manifold of dimension n can be triangulated by some simplicial complex [formula], i.e. it can be realised as a polyhedron [\cite=MR0248844][\cite=MR0488059]. From now on all PL manifolds are regarded as polyhedra in some Euclidean space. If X is a PL manifold, then the link of every simplex of K is a PL standard sphere, i.e. it is PL homeomorphic to ∂Δn.

The following result is certainly known, but the author has not found a reference.

A piecewise linear manifold M on which a finite group G acts by piecewise linear homeomorphisms can be triangulated by a simplicial complex K such that the action of G on |K| is simplicial, i.e. maps simplices linearly onto simplices.

We first triangulate M by a simplicial complex [formula]. For each g∈G we can choose a subdivision Lg of K such that g maps simplices of Lg linearly into simplices of K (cf. [\cite=MR0248844]). Let L be the cell complex obtained by intersecting the cell complexes Lg. Then the restriction of each element g∈G to each cell of L is linear. Therefore, the translates gL are again cell complexes. Hence, their intersection [formula] is a cell complex on which G acts cellularly, i.e. it maps cells linearly onto cells. Now we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:subdivision_cell_simplex] to this complex. By construction, the group G acts simplicially on the resulting simplicial complex.

Piecewise differentiable maps and smoothings

The following definition is central for comparing piecewise linear and smooth spaces.

We call a map f:P  →  M from a polyhedron P to a smooth manifold M piecewise differentiable or PD, if there exists a triangulation K of P such that the restriction of f to each simplex is smooth. We call f a PD homeomorphism, if it is moreover a homeomorphism and each simplex is smoothly embedded, i.e. for each simplex σ∈K and each point p∈σ the differential (df|σ)p is injective.

A smooth structure on a PL manifold M is called compatible with the PL structure of M, if the identity map from M as a PL manifold to M as a smooth manifold is a PD homeomorphism. It is known that all PL manifolds up to dimension 7 can be smoothed and that such smoothings are unique up to isotopy in dimensions lower or equal to 6. General smoothing theory is described in [\cite=MR0415630] and [\cite=MR0645390]. For the proof of our main result we only need the uniqueness statement in dimensions [formula], which follows from the fact that every diffeomorphism of S2 can be extended to a diffeomorphism of the unit 3-ball (cf. [\cite=MR1435975]).

Approximating PD maps by PL maps

In this section we explain how PD maps can be approximated by PL maps.

Two PD maps [formula] are called C1 δ-close, if there exists a triangulation K of P such that both f|σ and |σ are smooth and the values of (f - )|σ and their first derivatives are bounded by δ for every simplex σ∈K.

The following result is proven in [\cite=MR0198479].

Let [formula] be a PD homeomorphism from a compact polyhedron to a smooth submanifold M of [formula]. Then there exist some δ > 0 such that every PD map :P  →  M that is C1 δ-close to f is also a PD homeomorphism.

In order to approximate PD maps by PL maps we need the following concept (cf. [\cite=MR0198479]).

Let K' be a subdivision of a simplicial complex K and let [formula] be a PD map. The secant map [formula] is defined to be the map that is linear on the simplices of K' and coincides with f on the vertices of K'.

By definition LK'f is a PL map. We would like to choose the subdivisions K' such that LK'f becomes close to f in the C1 sense. To this end one needs to ensure that the thickness of the simplices in the subdivisions stays bounded from below. The thickness of a simplex is defined to be the ratio of the minimal distance of its barycenter to its boundary and its diameter (cf. [\cite=MR0198479]). The following result holds [\cite=MR0198479].

Let K be a finite simplicial complex and let [formula] be a PD map. Then for every δ  >  0 there exists a subdivision K' of K such that the secant map LK'f is C1 δ-close to f.

Finite group actions on spheres

Using Ricci flow techniques Dinkelbach and Leeb showed that any smooth action of a finite group on S3 is smoothly conjugate to an orthogonal action [\cite=MR2491658]. The same statement is true for smooth actions of finite groups on S2, but in this case it follows more elementary, either by the uniformization theorem or by the geometrization of spherical 2-orbifolds (cf. [\cite=MR2883685] [\cite=MR2954692]).

Proof of the main result

Let K be a simplicial complex that is also a PL manifold of dimension n  ≤  4. We are going to show that the complex K admits a smoothing with respect to which every simplicial isomorphism of K is smooth. This implies our main result according to Proposition [\ref=prp:triangulation]. Parts of the proof are by induction on the dimension. However, in dimension three and four additional issues have to be dealt with. Let us first sketch the induction step before we describe the proof in detail. By induction we will obtain a certain smoothing of the link of each vertex in K. We use such a smoothing to construct a chart contained in the star of the corresponding vertex. We do this in such a way that charts contained in simplicially isomorphic stars are equivalent, that the obtained charts form an atlas of K and that the resulting smooth structure is compatible with the piecewise linear structure. In constructing such charts we are facing two disjoint problems. Extending the smooth structure inwards to the cone point in a compatible way and extending it outwards such that overlapping charts are compatible. The problem of extending the smooth structure inwards to the cone point can be treated by using the following two key lemmas. The first lemma just formulates the uniqueness of smoothings and the linearizability of finite group actions on spheres in dimensions n  ≤  3 in a suitable manner (cf. Section [\ref=sub:linearization] and Section [\ref=sec:smoothing_theory]).

Let K be a triangulated PL n-sphere, [formula], on which a finite group G acts simplicially. Suppose that K is equipped with a smoothing with respect to which G acts smoothly. Then there exists a group homomorphism r:G  →  O(n) and a G-equivariant PD homeomorphism [formula].

For a topological space X we denote by CX its open cone which is defined to be the quotient space [formula] where (x,t)  ~  (y,s) if and only if s = t = 0. For a PL space X, the cone CX inherits a natural PL space structure from X. Moreover, if X is a PL n-sphere, then CX is PL homeomorphic to [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR0350744]).

Let K be a triangulated PL n-sphere on which a finite group G acts simplicially. Suppose there exists a group homomorphism r:G  →  O(n) and a G-equivariant PD homeomorphism [formula]. Then for every 0 < ε < 1 this PD homeomorphism can be extended to an G-equivariant PD homeomorphism [formula] such that F(x,t)  =  tf(x) for all x∈K and all t > ε.

We cannot simply extend the map f linearly to the origin, because in this case the restriction to a simplex could be degenerate at the cone point. However, we can isotopy f along the radial direction to a map that can be linearly extended to the cone point in a compatible way. We do this in two steps. In the first step we isotopy f such that the wildly embedded simplices of K become spherical simplices. The second isotopy deforms the spherical simplices into flat simplices (cf. Figure [\ref=fig:isotopy]). More precisely, let [formula] be the radial projection and let [formula] be a smooth cutoff function with [formula], θ'(t)  ≤  0, θ(t) = 1 for t < 1 / 3 and θ(t) = 0 for 2 / 3 < t. According to Theorem [\ref=thm:PD_approx] we can subdivide the complex K such that the map [formula] becomes arbitrarily close to f in the C1-sense. Hence, the same is true for the map [formula]. For a sufficiently good approximation the map

[formula]

with θ1(t) = θ(2t - 1) is well-defined for t > 1 / 2. Moreover, if we choose a sequence of subdivisions such that [formula] converges to f in the C1-sense, then Ft converges uniformly in t to f in the C1-sense. Therefore the map

[formula]

defines a G-equivariant PD homeomorphism onto its image by Theorem [\ref=thm:PD_approx_close] applied to the maps Ft. With θ2(t) = θ(2t) we set

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Then the map [formula] descends to a G-equivariant PD homeomorphism [formula]. Finally, we can replace F by (x,t) = εF(x,t / ε) to guarantee the last condition.

The compatibility of overlapping charts will be guaranteed by defining the outward extensions in a certain canonical way. To this end we endow a simplicial complex K with a polyhedral metric such that any 1-simplex in K has unit length and such that the simplices of K are flat. We denote the set of vertices of K(1), the barycentric subdivision of K, whose supporting simplex in K has dimension i by ci(K) and set [formula] where [formula]. Each point x∈c(K) has a neighborhood [formula] that splits isometrically as a product Vx  ×  Sx of open sets [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the set of points in [formula] for which the straight line between x and y meets [formula] orthogonally. Note that open sets [formula] and [formula] are disjoint for distinct x,y∈ci(K).

A neighborhood [formula] of x∈c(K) as above is called a product neighborhood. We call it a symmetric product neighborhood if Ux is in addition invariant under all simplicial isomorphisms of [formula] that leave [formula] invariant. An open cover U  =  {Ux}x∈c(K) of K consisting of symmetric product neighborhoods Ux of x∈c(K) is called a symmetric product cover, if for all [formula] and all x,y∈ci(K) any simplicial isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] that maps [formula] onto [formula], maps Ux onto Uy.

In order to have control on the sizes of product neighborhoods of a symmetric product cover U (cf. proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2]) we introduce its fineness [formula] defined as

[formula]

We call a collection of symmetric product covers, one for each triangulated piecewise linear n-manifold, uniform, if the conditions in Definition [\ref=dfn:unifrom-cover2] also hold for points x and y in distinct triangulated piecewise linear n-manifolds and if the finenesses of the symmetric product covers are uniformly small. The supremum of [formula] over covers of the collection is called the fineness of the collection of symmetric product covers.

It is clear that triangulated piecewise linear 1-manifolds admit a uniform collection of symmetric product covers with arbitrarily small fineness. In higher dimensions such will later be constructed inductively. Given a symmetric product cover, we would like to find a smoothing that behaves accordingly in the following sense.

Let U be a symmetric product cover of a triangulated piecewise linear n-manifold K. A smoothing of K is called a product smoothing with respect to U, if for each product neighborhood Ux = Vx  ×  Sx∈U of a point x∈c(K) the sets Vx and Sx are smooth submanifolds of K, the set Vx is moreover a smooth submanifold of the simplex [formula] and the restriction of the smooth structure on K to Ux coincides with the product smooth structure on Ux = Vx  ×  Sx.

Moreover, given a uniform collection of symmetric product covers, we would like to construct product smoothings that are uniform accordingly in the following sense.

Suppose we are given a uniform collection of symmetric product covers, one for each triangulated piecewise linear n-manifold. We say that a collection of product smoothings, one for each triangulated piecewise linear n-manifold adapted to the corresponding symmetric product cover, is uniform, if for any two points x∈c(K) and x∈c(L) in any two triangulated piecewise linear n-manifolds K and L the following condition holds. Any simplicial isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] that maps [formula] onto [formula] and thus Ux = Vx  ×  Sx onto Uy = Vy  ×  Sy restricts to a diffeomorphism between Sx and Sy and hence to a diffeomorphism between Ux and Uy.

We combine the introduced concepts in the following definition.

We say that PL n-manifolds can be canonically smoothed if

there exists a uniform collection of symmetric product covers for triangulated piecewise linear n-manifolds,

any triangulated piecewise linear n-manifold K admits an atlas defining a compatible smooth structure and comprising one chart for each vertex of K that is contained in the star neighborhood of this vertex

such that

the resulting smoothings form a uniform collection of product smoothings with respect to the uniform collection of symmetric product covers,

any simplicial isomorphism between star neighborhoods of vertices in any two triangulated piecewise linear manifolds maps corresponding charts onto each other.

Thurston calls a collection of smoothings canonical if they satisfy condition b and (ii) in the preceding definition (cf. [\cite=MR1435975]).

Our main theorem follows once we prove the following proposition.

For n  ≤  4 PL n-manifolds can be canonically smoothed.

In view of proving Proposition [\ref=prp:can_smoothing] we first prove a stronger statement in dimensions [formula]. Note that the proof of this statement is formulated in a more general way. Except for certain parts which require the assumption [formula] as will be pointed out explicitly, the proof can later again be applied in higher dimensions.

For n  ≤  2 PL n-manifolds can be canonically smoothed. Moreover, the smoothings can be chosen in such a way that for a given triangulated PL n-manifold all of its simplices are smoothly embedded.

Any triangulated PL 1-manifold with its canonical metric is either isometric to a circle or to the real line and by this identification we obtain the desired smooth structure. Let n = 2, fix corresponding uniform collections of symmetric product covers and product smoothings for triangulated PL 1-manifolds and let ε be small. The link of any vertex v in any triangulated PL 2-manifold K is a triangulated circle. Let G be the group of all simplicial isomorphism of such a link [formula]. This group acts smoothly with respect to the canonical smooth structure of [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_linearization] there exists a group homomorphism r:G  →  O(2) and a G-equivariant PD homeomorphism [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_extension] we can extend f to a G-equivariant PD homeomorphism [formula] such that F(x,t)  =  tf(x) for all [formula] and all t > ε / 2. Note that in this case of dimension n = 2 we can simply identify a rescaled version of [formula] with respect to its canonical metric with S1 to obtain the map [formula] instead of applying Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_linearization]. Hence, in this case the map F can be chosen such that its restriction to the cone over each simplex of [formula] is a smooth embedding (cf. proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_extension]). This construction defines charts [formula] which are however in general not compatible with each other. We want to replace them by charts [formula], defined on a small open neighborhood of [formula], that are compatible with each other. The idea is to construct the map [formula] as indicated in Figure [\ref=fig:Function_H]. The construction will guarantee that the smooth structures defined by two overlapping charts are product smooth structures on their overlap that fit together by induction. The map Hε,v is going to be composed of building blocks h = hε:CΔn  →  CΔn that are constructed in the following lemma. For n = 3 the need of a modified version of this lemma (cf. Lemma [\ref=lem:modified_version]) will become clear later. Recall that a map h between subsets [formula] is called smooth, if it admits a smooth extension onto an open neighborhood of A and that it is called a diffeomorphism, if it is smooth and has a smooth inverse.

Let Δn, n = 1,2, be a simplex together with a symmetric product cover U. We endow [formula] with a flat metric such that all sides of (Δn  ×  [0,1]) /   ~   have unit length. Then for every ε > 0 there exists a diffeomorphism

[formula]

such that the following properties hold

the map h is equivariant with respect to the group of isometries of CΔn.

for all [formula] and all x∈Δn we have [formula].

[formula].

for all t1,t2  ≥  2ε, all x∈c(K) and all (vi,si)∈Ux = Vx  ×  Sy∈U, i = 1,2, we have

[formula]

A proof of this lemma can be found below. Copies of h can be put together to a homeomorphism [formula] that is equivariant with respect to the group of all simplicial isomorphisms of [formula]. We define

[formula]

for some small ε' that will be specified later and claim that the new charts are compatible with each other. Before proving this we make the following observations. Let σ be a simplex of K with two different vertices u and v. Then we have

[formula]

and thus there exists a simplicial isomorphism between the corresponding stars that maps [formula] onto [formula] and is the identity on [formula]. Such a simplicial isomorphism restricts to a diffeomorphism between the product neighborhoods Ux = Vx  ×  Sx of [formula] in [formula] and Uy = Vy  ×  Sy of [formula] in [formula] corresponding to the uniform collection of symmetric product covers and smoothings of triangulated PL 1-manifolds that we have fixed above, and further to a diffeomorphism f:Sx  →  Sy (cf. Definition [\ref=dfn:uniform_smoothings]). Note that this diffeomorphism f is independent of the specific choice of the simplicial isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] we started with. Suppose we have (v1,x)∈Ux = Vx  ×  Sx, (v2,y)∈Uy = Vy  ×  Sy and some t1,t2  ≥  2ε with Hε,v((v1,x),t1) = Hε,u((v2,y),t2). Then it is clear by the properties of the maps Hε,v and Hε,u and because of f(x) = y that Hε,v((v1,s1),t1) = Hε,u((v2,f(s1)),t2) holds for all s1∈Sx (cf. (i) and (iv) in Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local]). By this observation and the properties of the map h (cf. (iv) in Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local]), we can construct a symmetric product cover of K, and more generally of any triangulated piecewise linear 2-manifold, as described in the following lemma.

Suppose we have fixed a uniform collection of symmetric product covers of triangulated piecewise linear n-manifolds, n = 1,2, and some 0 < ε <  < 1. For a triangulated piecewise linear (n + 1)-manifold K and a vertex v∈K(1) let [formula]. For [formula] we set

[formula]

Otherwise v is a vertex of K and we set Ũv  =  Hε(B3ε(v)). Then the sets   =  {Ũv}v∈K(1) define a uniform collection of symmetric product covers of triangulated piecewise linear (n + 1)-manifolds. Moreover, the fineness of the collection of sets [formula] can be chosen to be arbitrarily small by choosing ε and the fineness of the uniform collection of symmetric product covers of triangulated piecewise linear n-manifolds we started with sufficiently small.

Let   =  {Ũv}v∈K(1) be the symmetric product cover of K given by Lemma [\ref=lem:new_product_cover] and let u and v be adjacent vertices of K. For fixed fineness we can choose ε' such that

[formula]

for all simplices σ of K with [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

where the union runs over all simplices of K that contain u and v as a vertex. Then, by the observation above and the regularity of the map h from Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local], the composition

[formula]

factorises through a product of a diffeomorphism between [formula] and [formula] (recall that Vx and Vy are smooth submanifolds of [formula] and [formula], respectively, cf. Definition [\ref=dfn:prod_smoothing]) and the diffeomorphism f:Sx  →  Sy introduced above. Hence, the restriction of the transition map [formula] to [formula] is smooth and thus it is everywhere smooth because of ([\ref=eqn:inclusion]). Moreover, we see that the resulting smooth structure on Ũc(σ)  =  ṽc(σ)  ×  S̃c(σ) is a product of the smooth structures on [formula] inherited from σ and on the submanifold [formula]. Consequently, the collection of charts {φv}v∈c0(K) defines an atlas and by construction any simplicial isomorphism between star neighborhoods of two vertices in any two triangulated PL 2-manifolds maps corresponding charts onto each other. Moreover, since the map h in Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local] is a diffeomorphism and since we did not have to subdivide [formula] in order to construct the map F in the case n = 2, the inclusions of the simplices of K are smooth embeddings. In particular, the defined smooth structure is compatible with the PL structure of K. It is even a product smoothing according to what has been shown above. Finally, it is clear that this construction yields a uniform collection of product smoothings corresponding to the given uniform collection of product covers.

Let us now prove Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local].

We can assume that CΔn is embedded in [formula] such that the cone point lies in the origin and such that Δn  =  Δn  ×  {1} lies in the [formula] plane. We first construct a vector field X with flow Φ such that the restriction of the map

[formula]

to CΔn satisfies all conditions of the lemma, but h̃(x,t)∈Ht: = {(x,s)∈CΔn|s = t} instead of the orthogonality condition in (iv). Here [formula] are cone coordinates corresponding to [formula]. Afterwards we reparametrise the map h̃ along the flow lines of Φ in the interval (ε,2ε) such that the reparametrised map satisfies all conditions formulated in the lemma.

More precisely, for δ  >  0 we define U'x = Bδ(Vx)  ×  Bδ(Sx) where Bδ(Vx) is the open δ-neighborhood of Vx in [formula] and Bδ(Sx) is the open δ-neighborhood of Sx in [formula]. We choose δ such that the collection of sets [formula] still defines a symmetric product cover of Δn. For x∈c(Δn) we define

[formula]

Note that for each [formula] the sets Û'x, x∈ci(Δn), are disjoint and for (y,t)∈Û'x we have t > ε. Let Û'i be the union of the Û'x, x∈ci(Δn). Clearly [formula] is an open cover of Ht > ε: = {(x,t)∈CΔn|t > ε}. We want to define a smooth vector field X on Ht > ε / 2 that is equivariant with respect to the group of isometries of CΔn such that for some small δ' that will be specified later the following conditions are satisfied

X(p)n + 1 = cn for all p∈Ht > ε / 2.

X(p) = cnp / pn + 1 if pn + 1  <  εcn  +  δ'.

[formula] for p∈Û'x with pn + 1  >  εcn + 2δ'.

X(p) = X(q) for p,q∈Û'x with pn + 1 = qn + 1  >  εcn + 2δ' and [formula].

[formula] for all p,q,p',q'∈Û'x with pn + 1 = qn + 1 = p'n + 1 = q'n + 1 and [formula].

To this end, for a subset T  ⊂  c0(Δn), we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

The sets R(T) form a partition of Ht > ε. We define an equivariant vector field X+ on Ht > ε by [formula] if p∈R(T). The vector field X+ satisfies conditions (i)-(v) on Ht > ε  +  δ' / cn, but it is neither smooth nor continuous. However, we can mollify X+ such that the resulting vector field + is smooth and satisfies conditions (i)-(v) on Ht > ε  +  δ' / cn by a convolution with a centrosymmetric mollifier with sufficiently concentrated support. The vector field X-(p) = cnp / pn + 1 is well-defined on the upper halfspace, smooth and equivariant and satisfies conditions (i)-(v) on Ht < ε + 2δ' / cn. Hence, we can interpolate between X- and + in the interval ε  +  δ' / cn < t < ε + 2δ' / cn to obtain a desired vector field. Let h̃ be the map defined above with the flow Φ of this vector field. By continuity, for sufficiently small δ' the Δn-component in cone coordinates of h̃(y,t) lies in U'x for all y∈Ux and all t > 0. Hence, for such a δ' the map h̃ satisfies all conditions of the lemma by construction except the orthogonality condition in (iv). Instead we have h̃(x,t)∈Ht by (i). For sufficiently small δ' we can construct smooth maps fx:U'x  →  (3δ',ε - 3δ') by using the implicit function theorem such that for all t > ε and all y = (v,s)∈Ux = Vx  ×  Sx∈U we have

[formula]

We can use a partition of unity [formula] with [formula] on U'x for all x∈cj(K) with j  ≤  i to interpolate the maps fx, x∈c(K), to a map f:Δn  →  (3δ',ε - 3δ'), which can be assumed to be equivariant with respect to all isometries of CΔn, such that for all t > ε, all x∈c(K) and all y = (v,s)∈Ux = Vx  ×  Sx∈U we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be a smooth function with θ(t) = 0 for t < ε + 3δ', θ(t) = 1 for ε + 4δ' < t and θ'(t)  ≥  0 everywhere. Suppose that δ' < ε / 4. Then the reparametrised map

[formula]

has all desired properties.

Let us introduce the following notation before we proceed to the 3-dimensional case.

For a vertex v of a simplex Δn and 0 < s < 1 we define

[formula]

where we have realised Δn as a closed cone Δn - 1  ×  [0,s] with vertex v = (Δn - 1  ×  {0}) /   ~  . Analogously we define for a vertex v of an n-dimensional simplicial complex K

[formula]

If the complex is understood we simply write Ns(v).

Similar as in Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2], the statement in the 3-dimensional case is formulated in a more general way. The additional conclusions will be needed to treat the 4-dimensional case below.

PL 3-manifolds can be canonically smoothed. Moreover, for some 0 < s <  < 1 the smoothings can be chosen in such a way that for any triangulated PL 3-manifold K with symmetric product cover U and any 3-simplex Δ3 of K the cells [formula], v∈c0(K), are smoothly embedded and for all v∈c0(K) and all Ux∈U, x∈c(K), x  ≠  v, we have [formula].

We proceed as in the proof of the two-dimensional case (cf. Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2]), except that we may have to subdivide the link of a vertex v of a triangulated PL 3-manifold K during the procedure of Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_extension]. Therefore, the simplices of K are not necessarily smoothly embedded anymore. However, if we choose s = ε from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2], the cells [formula] are smoothly embedded in K for any 3-simplex Δ3 of K. The reason is that the necessary subdivisions introduced in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_extension] only cause non-smooth breaks for t < ε  /  2. We construct a uniform collection of symmetric product covers as in Lemma [\ref=lem:new_product_cover] and observe that for such a cover U of a triangulated piecewise linear 3-manifold K we have [formula] for all vertices v∈c0(K) of K and all Ux∈U, x∈c(K), x  ≠  v. Therefore everything follows as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2] except the compatibility of the piecewise linear and the smooth structure. To see this compatibility, we subdivide the simplicial neighborhoods Ns(v) as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_extension] and extend this subdivision to a subdivision of the initial triangulation of K as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:subdivision_cell_simplex]. With respect to such a triangulation all simplices are smoothly embedded and thus the claim follows.

Let us now prove the 4-dimensional version of Proposition [\ref=prp:can_smoothing].

PL 4-manifolds can be canonically smoothed.

The new difficulty compared to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2] and Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:3] is that in general we cannot apply Lemma [\ref=lem:rad_linearization] without subdividing the link of a vertex of a triangulated PL 4-manifold K. If we applied Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local] as before, we would still obtain a smooth structure invariant under all simplicial isomorphisms, but we could not guarantee its compatibility anymore, since we had no control about the effect of the maps Hv,ε on the simplices in our subdivision. However, we can use the following modified version of Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local] instead. The construction of the new map h is sketched in Figure [\ref=fig:Function_h]. It is piecewise linear in all regions [formula] in which we had to introduce nonsmooth breaks in the step before.

Let Δ3 be a simplex together with a symmetric product cover U and let s > 0 be such that Ns(v)  ⊂  Uv for all v∈c0(Δn). We endow [formula] with a flat metric such that all sides of (Δ3  ×  [0,1]) /   ~   have unit length. Then for every ε > 0 there exists a homeomorphism

[formula]

such that the following properties hold

the map h is equivariant with respect to the group of isometries of CΔ3.

for all [formula] we have [formula].

[formula].

the restriction of h to Δ3  ×  [ε,2ε] is PL and the restrictions of h to

[formula]

and Ns(x)  ×  {2ε}, x∈c0(Δ3), are linear.

the restrictions of h to [formula] and to [formula] are diffeomorphisms onto their images.

for all t1,t2  ≥  2ε, any vertex v of Δ3 and for all u1,u2∈Ns(v) we have

[formula]

for all t1,t2  ≥  3ε, all x∈c(K) and all (vi,si)∈Ux = Vx  ×  Sx∈U, i = 1,2, we have

[formula]

It is easy to define the map for t  ≤  2ε. Then the map is determined on [formula] by condition (vi) of the lemma. With the same methods as in Lemma [\ref=lem:subdivision_cell_simplex] the map can be extended to the rest of CΔn such that all desired properties hold.

Let us continue with the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:four-dim]. The properties of the maps h from this lemma and from Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local] differ only for small t. Therefore, using Lemma [\ref=lem:modified_version] with s as in Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:3] instead of Lemma [\ref=lem:function_h_local] to construct the maps Hε,v in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2], the compatibility of overlapping charts follows as before. In fact, everything else follows as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:2] and Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:3] except the compatibility of the PL and smooth structure. We set

[formula]

[formula]

and [formula]. Here the join [formula] is defined to be the set of points in [formula] that lie on a shortest path connecting a point of [formula] with v. Recall that we have endowed K with a smooth structure. By the properties of the map h in Lemma [\ref=lem:modified_version], the spaces I, J and L are polyhedra. Moreover, the inclusion [formula] is PD and the inclusion of L endowed with the smooth structure from the simplices of K into K is smooth and nondegenerate (cf. Lemma [\ref=lem:canonical_smooth_n:3]). We can first choose a triangulation of [formula] such that all its simplices are smoothly embedded in K. Then we can extend this triangulation to a triangulation of K all of whose simplices are smoothly embedded by again applying the method from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:subdivision_cell_simplex] as indicated in Figure [\ref=fig:LJ_sub]. Hence the constructed smooth structure is compatible with the PL structure and the claim follows.

There exist piecewise linear actions of [formula] on a 4-dimensional piecewise linear sphere that cannot be equivariantly smoothed. One way to obtain such an example is as follows (cf. [\cite=MR948910]). The group [formula] admits a piecewise linear action on S4 whose fixed point set is a knotted S2 [\cite=MR0515288]. By suspending this action one obtains a piecewise linear action of [formula] on S5 with fixed point set S3. However, this action cannot be equivariantly smoothed because its fixed point set S3  ⊂  S5 is not locally flat. Counterexamples in higher dimensions can be obtained by taking suspensions of this example.
