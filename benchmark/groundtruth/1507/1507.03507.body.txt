Introduction

Understanding the microscopic origin of black hole thermodynamics is one of the most important outstanding problem in theoretical physics. Recently Ref.[\cite=Morita:2013wfa] proposed the following microscopic description of the near extremal black branes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system. This system admits the extreme brane solution in which no force works between the parallel branes if we tune the dilaton coupling suitably. In case these branes are nearly parallel or slowly moving, they start interacting with each other and the low energy effective action for these branes is given as

[formula]

Here we consider 0-branes in four dimensions as a simple example. N is the number of the branes, [formula] is velocity of the i-th brane, m is mass of the brane and κ4 is the gravitational coupling. Also [formula] and [formula] denote the relative position and the relative velocity of the i-th and j-th branes. The first term is the ordinary non-relativistic kinetic term and the second term is the interactions between the branes which vanish when the branes are relatively static.

If we assume that the branes compose a bound state due to the interactions, we can estimate the thermodynamical properties of the bound state by applying the virial theorem to the effective action ([\ref=single-brane]). In [\cite=Morita:2013wfa], we found that the branes are strongly coupled in the bound state and the thermodynamical properties are coincident with the corresponding black brane thermodynamics in the near extremal regime (up to unfixed numerical factors). It suggests that the black hole thermodynamics may be explained via the effective action ([\ref=single-brane]) microscopically. We call this conjecture "p-soup proposal".

This proposal works in the various BPS branes in superstring and M-theory, and we can explain the black hole thermodynamics of the black brane solutions through the effective actions for these branes similar to ([\ref=single-brane]) [\cite=Wiseman:2013cda] [\cite=Morita:2013wla] [\cite=Morita:2014ypa]. (The related studies have been done in [\cite=Horowitz:1997fr] [\cite=Li:1997iz] [\cite=Banks:1997tn] [\cite=Li:1998ci] [\cite=Smilga:2008bt].) Moreover, this proposal works even in the D1-D5(-P) system [\cite=Morita:2014cfa]. Since this system [\cite=Callan:1996dv] [\cite=David:2002wn] involves the different species of the branes and the supersymmetry is less than the single brane case, it is non-trivial that the p-soup proposal works in such a system.

This motivates us to investigate general multiple species of branes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system. We set these multiple species of branes so that the forces between the branes vanish when they are static. It happens when the branes satisfy so-called "intersecting rule" [\cite=Argurio:1997gt], and the D1-D5(-P) system also satisfies it. Then we derive the effective action for these branes similar to ([\ref=single-brane]), and, by analyzing this action, we find that the bound state of these branes exhibits thermodynamical properties corresponding to the black hole thermodynamics. Thus the p-soup proposal works in this system, and we believe that it captures the fundamental natures of the black hole microstate.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:setup] we review Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory and clarify our setup of intersecting brane systems. In Sec. [\ref=sec:twobrane] we discuss intersecting brane systems of only two species of branes. This simple example would be helpful to understand our discussion without complicating the story. The general intersecting brane systems are discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:general], but the details of calculation are shown in [\ref=app:eff]. Sec. [\ref=sec-conclusion] is the discussions including possible applications to string theory. The corresponding black branes in supergravity and their thermodynamics are discussed in [\ref=app:thermo].

Intersecting brane system

We consider D-dimensional gravitational theory coupled to dilaton φ and (nA + 1)-form gauge field ([formula]). The action is given by

[formula]

Here aA is taken as

[formula]

in order to have asymptotically flat solutions, and so that extremal qA-brane solutions obey a 'no-force' condition when the branes are static and parallel .

We compactify (D - d - 3)-dimensional space as a rectangular torus TD - d - 3 and define its volume as VT. To make intersecting brane system in this setup, we put various branes on the torus. We set NA qA-branes winding around qA cycles of the torus ([formula]) and assume that the branes are smeared along the other cycles. When we set the branes, we respect the intersection rule: qA-brane and qB-brane wind around the same [formula] cycles of the torus, where [formula] is determined as

[formula]

where εA is 1 (- 1), if qA-brane is electrically (magnetically) coupled to the field strength FnA + 2 with qA = nA (qA = D - nA - 4). If all the branes satisfy this rule each other, 'no-force' work among them when they are static. Also we constrain d  ≥  1 so that the co-dimension of the branes is higher than two. (See Table [\ref=table-branes] as an example.)

We will consider the black brane solution for this setup and argue that their thermodynamical properties can be explained via the microscopic theory of interacting branes (up to numerical factors). It will work in general intersecting brane system as far as the branes satisfy the intersection rule. However, discussion on the general systems is rather complicated, and hence we first demonstrate it for a two brane system.

Example: two brane system

We consider the intersecting brane system which consists of N1 q1-branes and N2 q2-branes. They wind around q1 and q2 cycles of the torus, sharing [formula] cycles so that they satisfy the intersecting rule ([\ref=intersection-rule]). Note that, since [formula] has to be a non-negative integer, qA and D are restricted to particular combinations of values.

If we focus on only the non-compact (d + 3)-dimensional spacetime, the qA-branes behave as BPS particles with mass [formula] (A = 1,2). Here μA is the tension of the single qA-brane and VA is the volume of the qA-dimensional torus which the brane winds around. Due to the intersecting rule, no forces work between the branes when they are static. However, if they are moving, the interactions arise. Our proposal is that these interactions confine the branes and make them compose a bound state, and this bound state explains the thermodynamics of the intersecting q1-q2 black hole. To see this, we estimate the low energy effective action of this interacting brane system. If the branes are well separated, the gravitational interactions dominate and the effective action for this system has the following structure

[formula]

The derivation of this effective action is summarized in [\ref=app:eff]. Here

[formula]

is the kinetic term of the branes. [formula] and [formula] are the velocity and the position of the i-th brane in the non-compact (d + 2)-dimensional space. We have assumed that the velocity is low ([formula]) at low energy regime and used the non-relativistic approximation. We will justify this approximation soon. In addition, we have assumed that the volume of the torus is small and the motions of the branes depend on time t only.

[formula] is the interaction which arises from a single graviton (, gauge and dilaton) exchange between two branes,

[formula]

Here [formula] and [formula] denote the relative position and the relative velocity of the i-th and j-th branes, and [formula] is the (d + 3)-dimensional gravitational coupling constant. [formula] is the volume of a unit (d + 1)-sphere. The first and second terms describe the two-body interactions between two q1-branes and two q2-branes, respectively. The third term is the two-body interactions between a q1-brane and a q2-brane. There are higher order terms of [formula] but we have omitted them in this equation, since [formula] would be small in the low energy regime. Note that the power of [formula] of the third term is lower than the others, and it implies that the third term would dominate. Hence we treat this term separately and define it as

[formula]

We will soon see that it indeed becomes relevant.

Similarly the effective action has various interaction terms through the multi-graviton exchanges. Here we write down only the terms proportional to the lowest power of v, since they will become relevant at low energy. Among 3-graviton exchange interactions, the following term will be relevant,

[formula]

We define this term as L2. '~  ' in this article denotes equality not only including dependence on physical parameters but also including all factors of π. When we derive these interactions in [\ref=app:eff], we do not fix the precise numerical coefficients of these interactions. Since we will consider an order estimate for the thermodynamics of this interacting brane system, the precise expressions are not important. Similarly the system has the following interactions

[formula]

which describes the 2n - 1 graviton exchange among n q1-branes and n q2-branes.

From now, we estimate the dynamics of this system by using the virial theorem. We first assume that the branes are confined due to the interactions, and the branes satisfy

[formula]

Here v and r are the characteristic scales of the velocity and size of the branes in the bound state which do not depend on the species of the branes. (Note that since the masses of the q1-brane and q2-brane are generally different, we naively expect that these scales should depend on the species of the branes. However we will soon see that it does not occur in the bound state.) Then we can estimate the scales of the terms ([\ref=eff-kin]), ([\ref=eff-2-body-D1-D5]) and ([\ref=eff-4-body]) in the effective Lagrangian as

[formula]

The Lagrangian also have other terms ([\ref=moduli-multi-graviton]) but we will consider them later. Here we consider which terms in ([\ref=estimate-D1D5]) dominate at the low energy where v would be small (v  ≪  1). In the second line of ([\ref=estimate-D1D5]), the third term which is from L1 ([\ref=eff-2-body-D1-D5]) would dominate, since the power of v is lowest . Suppose that this term is balanced to the term in the third line which is from L2 ([\ref=eff-4-body]) due to the virial theorem, we obtain the relation between v and r as

[formula]

Now we see that the other terms listed in ([\ref=estimate-D1D5]) are indeed subdominant at this scaling. To see this, it is convenient to define [formula]. Then the scaling relation ([\ref=scale-v-r]) is rewritten as v2  ~  r2d  /  Q1Q2 and the low energy |v|  ≪  1 indicates rd  /  Q1 and rd  /  Q2 are small. Thus the terms in the Lagrangian ([\ref=estimate-D1D5]) scale as,

[formula]

Here the ordering of the terms is the same as in eq. ([\ref=estimate-D1D5]). We see that L1 and L2 scale as Ωd + 1rd  /  κ2d + 3, while the other terms earn the factors of rd  /  Q1 and/or rd  /  Q2 and are suppressed at low energy (rd  ≪  Q1,Q2). This self-consistently ensures our assumption that L1 and L2 are relevant at the low energy, and hence the scaling relation ([\ref=scale-v-r]) is confirmed. Note that the masses of the branes always appear as the combination m1m2 in L1 and L2, and it ensures that the scales of the position r and velocity v are independent of the species of the branes as we assumed in ([\ref=assumption-scales]).

So far we have considered the terms up to L2, and now we consider Ln ([\ref=moduli-multi-graviton]) (n  ≥  3) too. We can see that at the scaling ([\ref=scale-v-r]) which was derived via the virial theorem L1  ~  L2, all the other interactions Ln also become the same order. It means that the branes are strongly coupled in the bound state. We called such a bound state as 'warm p-soup' in Ref. [\cite=Morita:2013wfa].

From now, we evaluate the thermodynamical quantities of the bound state. By substituting the relation ([\ref=scale-v-r]) to the Lagrangian L  ~  L1, we estimate the free energy of the system as

[formula]

Here we consider temperature dependence. When the bound state is thermalized, we treat [formula] as a thermal field (particle) and expand [formula]. Hence we assume that the velocity v  =  ∂tr are characterized by the temperature of the system through

[formula]

Note that such a relation is not held generally if the system has a mass gap, but there would be no mass gap in the interacting brane system as argued in Ref. [\cite=Morita:2013wfa]. Then, from ([\ref=scale-v-r]), we obtain the relation between the size of the bound state and the temperature

[formula]

Here we have assumed d  ≠  1, and we will consider d = 1 case later. By substituting this relation into the free energy ([\ref=free-energy-D1D5]), we estimate the entropy of the bound state as

[formula]

We compare the obtained quantities with the corresponding black hole solution. In the near extremal regime, the black hole thermodynamics tells us,

[formula]

The derivation of these expressions is summarized in [\ref=app:thermo], and we have taken M = 2. Here rH is the location of the horizon. Therefore, if we identify the size of the bound state r with the horizon rH, our result ([\ref=free-energy-D1D5]), ([\ref=scale-r-T]) and ([\ref=entropy-D1D5]) reproduce the parameter dependences of the black hole thermodynamics including π. (rH depends on the coordinate and we have argued what coordinate is natural in [\cite=Morita:2013wfa].) This agreement may indicate that the interacting q1 and q2-branes described by the effective action ([\ref=moduli-D1D5]) provide the microscopic origin of the q1-q2 black hole thermodynamics.

Now we comment on the assumption rd  ≪  Q1,Q2 which we have used when we consider the effective action ([\ref=moduli-D1D5]). At the scale ([\ref=scale-r-T]), this relation becomes

[formula]

Since we consider here the situation Q1  /  Q2  ~  O(1), this means [formula] and this is the near extremal limit in supergravity. Thus our analysis is valid when we consider the near extremal black holes.

Finally we consider the d = 1 case. In this case the relations ([\ref=scale-v-r]) and ([\ref=key-assumption]) fix T as

[formula]

and r remains as a free parameter. This is the Hagedorn behavior, and this temperature is coincident with the Hagedorn temperature in supergravity ([\ref=HagedornT]). Thus the p-soup proposal works even in the d = 1 case too.

General intersecting black brane

We discuss general black brane system with arbitrary number of species of branes. We can also introduce momentum along one of the cycles of the torus if all the branes wind around this cycle. (We define R as the radius of this cycle.) In this case, the momentum is quantized as NP / R and there are NP gravitational waves each of which carries a momentum 1 / R. We can regard this gravitational wave as a 0-brane with mass 1 / R via the KK reduction of this cycle. Although the setup is complicated, we will see a simple result that the effective theory of the separated intersecting branes explains the black hole thermodynamics of the corresponding black brane at low energy.

In [\ref=app:eff], we argue the derivation of the low energy effective action for NA qA-branes ([formula]) where M is the number of the species of the charges (including momentum if we introduce it). The dominant terms of the action are given by

[formula]

where A is the product including momentum. Similar to the two brane case, we apply the virial theorem and estimate the thermodynamics of this system. With the assumption ([\ref=assumption-scales]), the first two terms of the action scale as

[formula]

Therefore through the virial theorem L1  ~  L2, we obtain the relation between v and r as

[formula]

Then the free energy can be estimated as

[formula]

Note that this expression is common for all M. Moreover, if we assume the relation between the velocity and temperature of the system v  ~  πTr, we can estimate the radius of horizon

[formula]

for dM - 2  ≠  0. Using the expressions of free energy and horizon radius, the entropy can be written as

[formula]

Now we compare our results with the corresponding black hole thermodynamics. The results in the black hole are shown in eqs. ([\ref=rH:sugra]), ([\ref=en:sugra]) and ([\ref=F:sugra]). We can check that our results are coincident with the black hole thermodynamics up to rational numerical factors. Similar consistency can be also seen for the Hagedorn case (dM - 2 = 0).

Discussions

We generalized the p-soup proposal [\cite=Morita:2013wfa] to the intersecting brane systems. We figured out that, in case the branes satisfy the intersection rule ([\ref=intersection-rule]), the bound state of the branes exhibits the thermodynamical properties which agree with the corresponding black brane. Although the intersecting brane systems are complicated themselves, this result is strikingly simple, and we believe that our proposal captures profound natures of the black hole microstates.

Also we can apply the results to superstring theory and M-theory. For example, the D1-D5 brane system studied in [\cite=Morita:2014cfa] can be mapped to other brane configurations such as D0-D4 system or M5-P system via string dualities [\cite=Martinec:1999sa]. Then we can investigate the microstates of these branes similarly. Furthermore the phase transitions between these branes [\cite=Martinec:1999sa] could be understood microscopically in a fashion of [\cite=Morita:2014ypa]. In such a way, we can study the various black brane dynamics in string theory through our proposal.

Moreover, our discussion would be important to investigate supersymmetric gauge theories. In the case of the single-species Dp/M-branes, through the gauge/gravity correspondence, the duality between the black branes and the supersymmetric gauge theories on the branes at finite temperature is expected [\cite=Itzhaki:1998dd]. We can explain this duality by using the fact that the effective action for the interacting N branes (a variety of ([\ref=single-brane])), which is obtained from gravity, is also derived from the supersymmetric gauge theory on the branes as a low energy effective action [\cite=Morita:2013wfa]. Not only that, the effective action might be useful to estimate several quantities in the gauge theory which cannot be calculated in the gravity [\cite=Morita:2014ypa]. In the case of the intersecting brane systems, much more varieties of supersymmetric gauge theories appear on the branes than the single-species brane case. There, the effective action ([\ref=lag-gen]) may play a key role to understand the dynamics of these gauge theories.

In this way, the p-soup proposal may be important in the various contexts in theoretical physics. In order to establish the proposal, we have to derive the thermodynamical quantities from the effective action ([\ref=lag-gen]) exactly and compare them with the black hole results. However even fixing the coefficients of the interactions in the effective action ([\ref=lag-gen]) is difficult in the intersecting brane system, and we need to find a clever way to solve this issue. If we could achieve it, it must be a valuable step toward the understanding of the black hole microstate.

Thermodynamics of intersecting black brane

In this appendix, we introduce the intersecting black brane system and its thermodynamical properties. We consider the brane configuration discussed around equation ([\ref=intersection-rule]). In the non-extremal case, the metric for the intersecting black brane with momentum is given by

[formula]

where the index A is given for each species of branes and yα ([formula]) denote the coordinates for TD - d - 3. Here we have introduced momentum for one of the isometric directions y1 around which all the branes wind. Then the y1 direction is Lorentz boosted:

[formula]

For the other directions of yα, some of the branes wind around them. If the brane A wind around the yα-cycle, δ(α)A = 1. If not, δ(α)A = 0. (If we don't introduce momentum P = 0, not all the branes have to wind around the y1-cycle and we treat y1 as one of yα's.)

The gauge potentials and dilaton are given by

[formula]

Thus the field strength behaves [formula] (r  →    ∞  ), and we can read off the charges of the black brane from it. Then by dividing the charges by [formula] where μA is the tension of a single qA-brane, we obtain the number of the qA-branes which compose the black brane as

[formula]

Here VT is the volume of TD - d - 3 and VA is the volume of the TqA around which the qA-branes wind. (The volume dependence has arisen since the branes are smeared on the (D - d - 3 - qA)-dimensional torus with the volume VT / VA.) Hence QA is written as

[formula]

in the near extremal regime (QA  ≫  2μ). It is convenient to define the (d + 3)-dimensional gravitational coupling [formula] and mass of the qA-brane [formula]. By using them, QA is rewritten as

[formula]

The momentum is also quantized because of compactification. Since  / K can be regarded as a Kaluza-Klein gauge potential, similar to ([\ref=brane-number]), we can easily read off the relation between the parameter P and NP which is the number of the momentum with the unit 1 / R where R is the radius of the y1-cycle,

[formula]

We discuss the thermodynamical quantities of this black brane in the near extremal regime. To do it, we formally reduce the torus part and regard the black brane as a (d + 3)-dimensional black hole. Through the dimensional reduction, the (d + 3)-dimensional metric in Einstein frame becomes

[formula]

Then we can read off the ADM energy E from the gtt component of the metric,

[formula]

where A is the sum including momentum as one of charges as mANA = NP / R if we introduce it (i.e. P  ≠  0) and M is the number of the species of the charges (including momentum).

The Hawking temperature is obtained through the smoothness condition of the metric in the Euclidean signature. In the near extremal limit μ  →  0, we obtain

[formula]

where A is the product including momentum if we introduce it. Then, if M  ≠  2 / d, we see the radius of horizon can be expressed as

[formula]

If M = 2 / d, the radius of the horizon remains as a free parameter of the system while temperature is fixed as

[formula]

This is called the Hagedorn behavior and the thermodynamical quantities are characterized by rH rather than temperature.

The area of horizon can be calculated using the angular part (dΩ2d + 1) of the metric, and it is given by

[formula]

Then we obtain the entropy by using Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula

[formula]

Finally we obtain the free energy F = E - TS from ([\ref=ADM]), ([\ref=TH:sugra]) and ([\ref=en:sugra]),

[formula]

where we have omitted the temperature independent terms in ([\ref=ADM]).

Derivation of the effective action of intersecting branes

In this appendix, we derive the effective action for separated intersecting NA qA-branes. We assume that the branes satisfy the intersection rule ([\ref=intersection-rule]), then no force work between the branes if they are static. When the branes are excited and moving, they gravitationally interact with each other. We derive the effective action for this system at low energy.

However our purpose of this paper is the derivation of the parametric dependence of the thermodynamical quantities of this system and we do not need the precise numerical coefficients of the effective action. Hence we employ the probe action and read off the interactions between the branes up to numerical factors (but we keep the π dependences).

First we consider the extremal brane geometry

[formula]

where yα ([formula]) denote the coordinates for TD - d - 3 and xi ([formula]) denote the coordinates for the non-compact (d + 2)-dimensional space. This geometry is merely obtained from the black brane ([\ref=metric-gen]) with μ = 0. To see the interactions, we choose one of the branes in the system and consider the probe brane action for this brane [\cite=Morita:2013wfa]

[formula]

where γμν is the worldvolume metric induced from the spacetime metric ([\ref=metric-gen])

[formula]

and ÊA is the pullback of gauge potential ([\ref=gauge]) to the brane worldvolume. We take the static gauge and assume that Zm depend only on time t, i.e. Zm = Zm(t). (See footnote [\ref=ftnt-KK].) Also we ignore the motion of the branes on the torus by assuming the branes are smeared. (See footnote [\ref=ftnt-GL].) Then the probe action becomes

[formula]

where m1  =  μAVA is mass of the probe brane and vm1  =  ∂tZm ([formula]) is velocity in the non-compact (d + 2)-dimensional space.

We assume the velocity is low (v1  ≪  1) and expand the action as

[formula]

Here we omit the rest mass term. By using eq. ([\ref=H2]), we can rewrite this as

[formula]

where M is the number of the species of charges including momentum.

Now we argue how to read off the interactions between the separated branes from this probe action. We first consider M = 2 case with no momentum (P = 0) which we discuss in section [\ref=sec:twobrane]. In this case the probe action ([\ref=probe-gen]) becomes

[formula]

In this action, since QA involves κ2d + 3 as shown in ([\ref=Q-N-relation]), the terms proportional to (QA)n would describe the n-graviton (, dilaton and gauge field) exchange interaction between the probe brane and other branes. For example, the first term and the third term do not depend on QA and they are merely the non-relativistic kinetic term [formula] and its relativistic correction [formula], respectively. On the other hand, the second term is proportional to [formula] and hence would describe the two body interaction between q1 and q2-brane. Thus it indicates that the separated intersecting N1 q1-brane and N2 q2-brane system has interactions

[formula]

Here [formula] is the relative position and [formula] is the relative velocity. In this way, we can estimate the interactions between the intersecting branes from the probe action. By regarding the probe action for q2-brane in the same background, we estimate the whole interactions between the intersecting branes and we finally obtain the effective action,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here [formula] describes the n-graviton exchange interactions among n + 1 branes. Note that we cannot determine the precise velocity dependence in this method, although it is not a matter for our current purpose. (In principle we can derive it if we use the method in Ref. [\cite=Okawa:1998pz].)

By repeating these estimations, we can obtain the interaction terms in the form of infinite series. However we do not need to derive the whole interactions to discuss the thermodynamics of the intersecting brane system. As we argue in section [\ref=sec:twobrane], only a few of the interaction terms are relevant at low energy ([formula]). There Q1 / rd, ~ Q2 / rd  ≫  1 would be satisfied as discussed around eq. ([\ref=r-Q]), and, to read off the dominant interactions in this regime from the probe action, we can approximate HA  ~  QA / rd. Then we obtain the relevant terms of the effective action

[formula]

For the case of general M, the discussion is almost parallel to the M = 2 case. We can show that QA / rd  ≫  1 would be satisfied at low energy and we can use the approximation HA  ~  QA / rd when we read off the dominant terms of the effective action for the intersecting branes from the probe action ([\ref=probe-gen-1]). We can treat the momentum P in the same way since it can be regarded as an additional charge via the KK reduction. Especially the gravitational wave which carries the momentum 1 / R can be regarded as a 0-brane with mass 1 / R and we take into account the interactions to the other branes. As a result, we obtain the low energy effective action

[formula]

where the first two terms are

[formula]

and a general n-th term is

[formula]

This describes the nM - 1 graviton exchange among n qA-branes ([formula]).
