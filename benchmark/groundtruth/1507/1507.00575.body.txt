Status of measurement of KS  →  πeν branching ratio and lepton charge asymmetry with the KLOE detector

Introduction

A special role in [formula] violation searches plays a neutral kaon system which, due to a sensitivity to a variety of symmetry violation effects, is one of the best candidates for such kind of studies. One of the possible tests is based on the comparison between semileptonic asymmetry in KS decays (AS) and the analogous asymmetry in KL decays (AL)[\cite=handbook_cp]. So far the AL[\cite=ktev_kl_charge_asymm] was determined with a precision more than two orders of magnitude better than AS[\cite=kloe_final_semileptonic]. The present accuracy of AS determination is dominated by the statistical uncertainty. Therefore the aim of this work is a determination of AS with two times smaller statistical error due to four times bigger data sample and improved systematical uncertainties. Charge asymmetry is also an important source of information about the real and imaginary parts of the [formula] violating parameter δK. Until now Re(δK) was known with much worse precision than Im(δK).

The measurement was performed using KLOE detector[\cite=kloe] located at DAΦNE accelerator[\cite=dafne] in the National Laboratory in Frascati, Italy. The experimental data used in this paper has been collected during data campaign in 2004-2005.

Charge asymmetry in neutral kaons semileptonic decays

Neutral kaons are the lightest particles which contain a strange quark. Observed short-living KS and long-living KL are linear combinations of strange eigenstates (K0 and [formula]):

[formula]

where introduced small parameter εS and εL can be rewritten to separate [formula] and [formula] violation parameters εK and δK, respectively:

[formula]

In the Standard Model decay of K0 (or [formula]) state is associated with the transition of the s̄ quark into ū quark (or s into u) and emission of the charged boson. Change of strangeness (ΔS) implies the corresponding change of electric charge (ΔQ) (see Figure [\ref=feynmann_diagrams_semi]). This is so called ΔS  =  ΔQ rule. Therefore decays of K0  →  π-e+ν and   →  π+e- are present but K0  →  π+e- and   →  π-e+ν are not. Decay amplitudes for semileptonic decays of states [formula] and [formula] can be written as follows[\cite=handbook_cp]:

[formula]

where the Hweak is a part of Hamiltonian corresponding to the weak interaction and a, b, c, d parameters describe the semileptonic decay amplitudes. Applying the symmetry operators to above amplitudes a set of relations between them can be obtained (Table [\ref=tab_relations]). Semileptonic decay amplitudes can be associated with the KS and KL semileptonic decay widths through the charge asymmetry (AS,L):

[formula]

where above equation contains only the first order of symmetry-violating terms. Moreover, conservation of ΔQ  =  ΔS rule and [formula] symmetry simplifies Equation [\ref=eq4]. Determination the value of charge asymmetry for KS and KL allows for tests the fundamental assumptions of Standard Model.

The charge asymmetry for KL decays was precisely determined by KTeV experiment at Fermilab[\cite=ktev_kl_charge_asymm]. The measurement was based on 1.9 millions KL  →  π±e∓ν decays produced in collision of proton beam with BeO target. At present the most accurate measurement of KS charge asymmetry was conducted by KLOE collaboration[\cite=kloe_final_semileptonic]. Obtained charge asymmetry for KS decays is consistent in error limits with charge asymmetry for KL decays which suggest conservation of [formula] symmetry. However, this result is dominated by a statistical uncertainty which is three times larger than the systematic one. Nevertheless it can be improved by analysing 1.7 - 1 total luminosity data sample acquired in 2004 and 2005.

Measurement

The KLOE experiment located at DAΦNE φ factory is specially suited for analysis of KS  →  πeν decay. The KLOE detector is constituted by two main components: a drift chamber and an electromagnetic calorimeter, both inserted into an axial magnetic field (0.52 T). Due to the size of the KLOE drift chamber, about 40% of KL mesons decay inside the detector while the rest reach the electromagnetic calorimeter. Detection of KL interaction in the calorimeter allows to identify a KS meson on the opposite side of φ meson decay point.

In order to select semileptonic decay of KS meson, an additional kinematic selection is applied. It starts from a requirement of a vertex formed by tracks of two oppositely charged particles near the interaction point. Those tracks must be associated to calorimeter clusters. Obtained tracks parameters allow for identification of charged particles in the final state by applying a Time of Flight technique. For each particle, the difference δt between the measured time of associated cluster (tcl) and time of flight is calculated assuming a given mass hypothesis, mx:

[formula]

where L is a total length of particle trajectory and P is particle momentum measured by drift chamber. The Time of Flight technique aims at rejection of the background, which is mainly due to KS  →  π+π- events, and at identification of the final charge states (π-e+ν and π+e-). The distribution of difference between missing energy and momentum (ΔE(π,e)) shows remaining background components (see Figure [\ref=de_pi_e]). Altogether around 105 of KS  →  πeν decays was reconstructed, which will be used to determine the charge asymmetry and branching ratio for KS semileptonic decays. The analysis is still in progress and preliminary results will be available soon[\cite=my_master].
