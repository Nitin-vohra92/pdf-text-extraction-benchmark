Homological invariants of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a k-decomposable simplicial complex

Introduction

Squarefree monomial ideals are a class of ideals with strong connections to combinatorics and topology that have been studied extensively by many researchers in the last few years. In this regard the Stanley-Reisner correspondence plays an important role. Finding connections between algebraic invariants of a squarefree monomial ideal and combinatorial and topological invariants of its Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex is of great interest. k-decomposability is a topological combinatorial concept such as shellability and is related to the algebraic properties of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex. It was first introduced by Provan and Billera [\cite=Provan+Billera] for pure complexes. An analogous extension was given for non-pure complexes by Woodroofe in [\cite=W1]. For k = 0, this notion is known as vertex decomposable, firstly defined for non-pure complexes in [\cite=BW]. Defined in a recursive manner, k-decomposable simplicial complexes form a well-behaved class of simplicial complexes. It is known that a d-dimensional simplicial complex is d-decomposable if and only if it is shellable (see [\cite=W1]). In [\cite=RY], the concept of a k-decomposable monomial ideal was introduced and it was proved that a simplicial complex Δ is k-decomposable if and only if [formula] is a k-decomposable ideal.

Several recent papers have related some homological invariants of Stanley-Reisner rings such as the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the projective dimension with various invariants of the simplicial complex or the graph associated to the simplicial complex in the case it is a flag complex (see for example [\cite=Ha] [\cite=HTW] [\cite=KM] [\cite=kummini] [\cite=Moh] [\cite=MVi] [\cite=VT]). In this paper, we study the regularity and the projective dimension of a k-decomposable monomial ideal and the Stanley-Reisner ring associated to a k-decomposable simplicial complex, which extend some existing results about vertex decomposable simplicial complexes.

The paper is structured as follows. In the first section, we present the background material. In Section 2, first we study the graded Betti numbers of a k-decomposable monomial ideal and give an inductive formula for them (see Theorem [\ref=ss]). As a corollary, for a k-decomposable simplicial complex Δ, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the projective dimension of the Stanley-Reisner ring R / IΔ are explained recursively (see Theorem [\ref=regp]). This extends the result proved for vertex decomposable simplicial complexes in [\cite=MK] and [\cite=HTW]. Then for a chordal clutter H (in the sense of [\cite=W1]) with the simplicial vertex x and an edge [formula] containing x, we show that

[formula]

where [formula]'s and [formula] are chordal minors of H, which are chordal too.

Preliminaries

In this section, we recall some preliminaries which are needed in the sequel.

Simplicial complexes and clutters

Throughout this paper, we assume that [formula], Δ is a simplicial complex on the vertex set X, [formula] is a field, [formula] is the ring of polynomials in the variables [formula] and I is a monomial ideal of R. For a monomial ideal I, the unique set of minimal generators of I is denoted by G(I).

A simplicial complex on a vertex set X is a set Δ of subsets of X such that

for any x∈X, {x}∈Δ, and

if F∈Δ and G  ⊆  F, then G∈Δ.

Any element of Δ is called a face and maximal faces (under inclusion) are called facets of Δ. The set of all facets of a simplicial complex Δ is denoted by F(Δ). A simplicial complex with [formula] is denoted by [formula] and it means that Δ is generated by the facets [formula]. The dimension of a face F∈Δ is defined as |F| - 1 and is denoted by   (F). Moreover, the dimension of Δ is defined as   (Δ) =  max {  (F): F∈Δ}.

For a simplicial complex Δ with the vertex set X, the Alexander dual simplicial complex associated to Δ is defined as

[formula]

For a subset W  ⊆  X, let xW be the monomial [formula] and let [formula] be a squarefree monomial ideal. The Alexander dual ideal of I, denoted by [formula], is defined as

[formula]

where PWi = (xj: xj∈Wi).

One can see that

[formula]

where IΔ is the Stanley-Reisner ideal associated to Δ and [formula]. Moreover, [formula].

A clutter H on a vertex set V is a set E of subsets of V (called edges) such that

for any distinct elements e,e'∈E, one has [formula], and

|e|  ≥  2 for any e∈E.

The vertex set and the edge set of the clutter H are denoted by V(H) and E(H), respectively. There is a correspondence between clutters and the set of minimal non-faces of simplicial complexes in the following way.

Let H be a clutter. The edge ideal of H is an ideal of the ring [formula] defined as

[formula]

It is easy to see that I(H) can be viewed as the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the simplicial complex

[formula]

i.e., I(H) = IΔH. The simplicial complex ΔH is called the independence complex of H.

For a clutter H, and a vertex v∈V(H), the deletion [formula] is the clutter on the vertex set [formula] with the edge set {e: e∈E(H), v∉e}. The contraction H / v is the clutter on the vertex set [formula] with edges the minimal sets of [formula]. A clutter K obtained from H by repeated deletion and/or contraction is called a minor of H.

The concept of a simplicial vertex and a chordal clutter was introduced in [\cite=W1] as follows.

Let H be a clutter. A vertex v of H is called a simplicial vertex if for every two edges e1 and e2 of H that contain v, there is a third edge e3 such that [formula].

A clutter H is called chordal, if any minor of H has a simplicial vertex.

Woodroofe in [\cite=W1] also defined the concept of a containment pair of a clutter H as a vertex v and an edge e with v∈e such that for any edge e2  ≠  e with v∈e2, there exists an edge [formula].

k-decomposable simplicial complexes and k-decomposable ideals

For a simplicial complex Δ and F∈Δ, the link of F in Δ is defined as

[formula]

and the deletion of F is the simplicial complex

[formula]

Woodroofe in [\cite=W1] extended the definition of k-decomposability to non-pure complexes as follows.

[\cite=W1] Let Δ be a simplicial complex on vertex set V. Then a face σ is called a shedding face if every face τ containing σ satisfies the following exchange property: for every v∈σ there is [formula] such that [formula] is a face of Δ.

[\cite=W1] A simplicial complex Δ is recursively defined to be k-decomposable if either Δ is a simplex or else has a shedding face σ with   (σ)  ≤  k such that both [formula] and [formula] are k-decomposable. The complexes {} and [formula] are considered to be k-decomposable for all k  ≥   - 1.

Note that 0-decomposable simplicial complexes are precisely vertex decomposable simplicial complexes.

The notion of decomposable monomial ideals was introduced in [\cite=RY] as follows.

For the monomial [formula] in R, the support of u denoted by   (u) is the set {xi: ai  ≠  0}. For a monomial M in R, set   =  1 if for all xi∈  (u), [formula]. Otherwise set ≠  1.

For the monomial u and the monomial ideal I, set

[formula]

and

[formula]

For a monomial ideal I with [formula], the monomial [formula] is called a shedding monomial for I if Iu  ≠  0 and for each Mi∈G(Iu) and each [formula] there exists Mj∈G(Iu) such that [formula].

A monomial ideal I with [formula] is called k-decomposable if r = 1 or else has a shedding monomial u with |  (u)|  ≤  k + 1 such that the ideals Iu and Iu are k-decomposable.

A monomial ideal I in the ring R has linear quotients if there exists an ordering [formula] on the minimal generators of I such that the colon ideal [formula] is generated by a subset of [formula] for all 2  ≤  i  ≤  m. We show this ordering by [formula] and we call it an order of linear quotients on G(I).

Let I be a monomial ideal with linear quotients and [formula] be an order of linear quotients on the minimal generators of I. For any 1  ≤  i  ≤  m,   I(fi) is defined as

[formula]

The following theorem, which was proved in [\cite=T], is one of our main tools in the study of regularity of the ring R / IΔ.

[\cite=T] Let I be a squarefree monomial ideal. Then [formula].

Regularity and projective dimension of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a k-decomposable simplicial complex

In this section, first we explain the graded Betti numbers of a k-decomposable ideal inductively. Then using this formula, for a k-decomposable simplicial compelx Δ, recursive formulas for the regularity and the projective dimension of the Stanley-Reisner ring R / IΔ are given. Finally, we give an applicaion on chordal clutters.

The following theorem was proved in [\cite=RY]. In order to prove Theorem [\ref=ss], one needs to know the construction of the order of linear quotients for a decomposable ideal. So for the convenience of the reader, the proof is stated.

[\cite=RY] Any k-decomposable ideal has linear quotients.

Let I be a k-decomposable ideal, u be a shedding monomial for I and inductively assume that Iu and Iu have linear quotients. Let [formula] and [formula] be the order of linear quotients on the minimal generators of Iu and Iu, respectively. Then it is easy to see that [formula] is an order of linear quotients on the minimal generators of I, since for any t + 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, [formula], which is again generated by some variables. Indeed, by the definitions of Iu and Iu, for any x∈  (u) and any t + 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, there exists 1  ≤  i  ≤  t such that (fi):(gj) = (x).

The next theorem, which is a special case of [\cite=Leila], is our main tool to prove Theorem [\ref=ss].

[\cite=Leila] Let I be a monomial ideal with linear quotients with the ordering [formula] on the minimal generators of I. Then

[formula]

We also use the following lemma, which can be easily proved by induction on m.

Let i,k and m be non-negative integers. Then

[formula]

The following theorem generalizes [\cite=MK].

Let I be a k-decomposable ideal with the shedding monomial u. Then

[formula]

where m = |  (u)|.

For a monomial [formula] and 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, we set vi(f) = ai. By Theorem [\ref=q], if [formula] is an order of linear quotients on the minimal generators of Iu and [formula] is an order of linear quotients on the minimal generators of Iu, then [formula] is an order of linear quotients on the minimal generators of I,   I(fi) =   Iu(fi) for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  t and [formula] for any t + 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. Also for any t + 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, [formula], since for any [formula] and any distinct integers i and j, [formula] and then [formula]. Thus |  I(gi)| = |  Iu(gi)| + m. Now by Theorem [\ref=Leila],

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem1], we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

In the following corollary, recursive formulas for the regularity and the projective dimension of a k-decomposable ideal are presented.

Let I be a k-decomposable ideal with the shedding monomial u and m = |  (u)|. Then

[formula], and

[formula].

Hà in [\cite=Ha] gave an upper bound for the regularity of R / IΔ for an arbitrary simplicial complex Δ in terms of the deletion and the link of a face of Δ as follows.

[\cite=Ha] Let Δ be a simplicial complex and let σ be a face of Δ. Then

[formula]

As one of the main results of this paper, in Theorem [\ref=regp], it is shown that the inequality in Theorem [\ref=ha] becomes an equality for a k-decomposable simplicial complex and a shedding face σ. It also generalizes [\cite=MK]. To this aim we use the following theorem.

[\cite=RY] A d-dimensional simplicial complex Δ is k-decomposable if and only if [formula] is a squarefree k-decomposable ideal for any k  ≤  d.

Let Δ be a k-decomposable simplicial complex on the vertex set X with the shedding face σ. Then

[formula],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are Stanley-Reisner ideals of [formula] and [formula] on the vertex sets X and [formula], respectively.

(i) By [\cite=RY], [formula] is a decomposable ideal and xσ is a shedding monomial for [formula]. Also by Theorem [\ref=1.3], [formula]. Now, using Corollary [\ref=corvd],

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula], where [formula]. Thus [formula]. Since for any Fi with σ  ⊆  Fi and any 1  ≤  l  ≤  t, there exists Fj such that [formula] and xFcj:xFci = xl or equivalently [formula], so for any face F∈Δ with [formula], one has [formula] for some 1  ≤  l  ≤  t and some 1  ≤  i  ≤  m then F  ⊆  Fj for some Fj not containing σ. Thus [formula] and then [formula]. Also [formula]. Since for any Fi with σ  ⊆  Fi, one has [formula], so [formula], where [formula] is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of [formula] on the vertex set [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Again using Theorem [\ref=1.3], the result follows.

(ii) By Corollary [\ref=corvd],

[formula]

As was discussed above, [formula] and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

From the equalities [formula], [formula], [formula] and Theorem [\ref=1.3], one has [formula], which completes the proof.

Any k-decomposable simplicial complex is shellable and hence sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. So by [\cite=MVi], for a k-decomposable simplicial complex Δ, [formula] is equal to the big height of IΔ.

(Compare [\cite=MK]) If Δ is a vertex decomposable simplicial complex on the set X with the shedding vertex x , then [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are Stanley-Reisner ideals of [formula] on the vertex sets X and [formula], respectively. Thus [formula], where [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Note that in [\cite=MK], [formula] and [formula] are considered on the vertex set [formula].

As an application, we give an upper bound for the regularity of R / I(H) for a chordal clutter H in terms of the regularities of edge ideals of some minors of H which are chordal too. First we state the following easy lemma.

Let H be a clutter, Δ  =  ΔH, [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula].

Note that [formula], where [formula] denotes the set of minimal non-faces of [formula]. One has [formula] if and only if either F∈N(Δ) or F = σ. Thus [formula]. For any edge e'∈E(H), if [formula], then [formula]. Otherwise [formula] for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  d. Thus

[formula]

Also [formula]. For any [formula], one has

[formula]

Thus [formula].

Let H be a chordal clutter, x∈V(H) be a simplicial vertex for H and [formula] be an edge of H containing x and [formula]. Then

[formula], and

[formula]

(i) Since x is a simplicial vertex, one may observe that (x,e) is a neighborhood containment pair of H. Thus by [\cite=W1], [formula] is a shedding face of Δ  =  ΔH and by [\cite=W1], Δ is (k - 2)-decomposable, where k is the maximum cardinality of edges in H. Thus by Theorem [\ref=regp], [formula]. Now, by Lemma [\ref=h], the result holds.

(ii) Using the equality [formula], part (i), [\cite=kmu] and the fact that [formula], the result follows.
