Asymmetric Latin squares, Steiner triple systems, and edge-parallelisms

This article, showing that almost all objects in the title are asymmetric, is re-typed from a manuscript I wrote somewhere around 1980 (after the papers of Bang and Friedland on the permanent conjecture but before those of Egorychev and Falikman). I am not sure of the exact date. The manuscript had been lost, but surfaced among my papers recently.

I am grateful to Laci Babai and Ian Wanless who have encouraged me to make this document public, and to Ian for spotting a couple of typos. In the section on Latin squares, Ian objects to my use of the term "cell"; this might be more reasonably called a "triple" (since it specifies a row, column and symbol), but I have decided to keep the terminology I originally used.

Introduction

Recently, Bang [\cite=1] and Friedland [\cite=3] have shown that the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix of order n is at least [formula]. This result substantially improves known lower bounds for the numbers of combinatorial structures of the types mentioned in the title. (It is already documented in the literature [\cite=6] [\cite=8] [\cite=2] that such improvement would follow from the truth of the van der Waerden permanent conjecture; the result of Bang and Friedland is close enough to the conjecture to have the same effect.) In this paper, I give a possibly less well-known consequence of the result on permanents.

Almost all Latin squares, Steiner triple systems, or edge-parallelisms of complete graphs have no non-trivial automorphisms; that is, the proportion of such objects of an admissible order n admitting non-trivial automorphisms tends to zero as n  →    ∞  .

Here, as is well-known, n is admissible for Steiner triple systems if and only if [formula] or 3 (mod 6), and n is admissible for edge-parallelisms if and only if [formula] (mod 2). All integers are admissible orders of Latin squares. The paper concludes with the observation that a similar result holds for strongly regular graphs with least eigenvalue - 3 or greater.

I am grateful to J. H. van Lint for helpful discussions on permanents.

Latin squares

Given an n  ×  (n - k) Latin rectangle, the number of ways of choosing an [formula] row is the permanent of a (0,1) matrix of order n with row and column sums k (see Ryser [\cite=6]), and hence is at least [formula] (by [\cite=1] [\cite=3]). So the number of Latin squares of order n is at least [formula]. This number is greater than n(1 - ε)n2 for n  ≥  n0(ε).

We take the most general definition of an automorphism of a Latin square S, as a permutation on the 3n symbols indexing the rows, columns and entries (say [formula]) preserving the obvious partition into three sets R,C,E of size n and also the set of triples (ri,cj,ek) for which the (i,j) entry of S is k. (We call such triples cells.) If an automorphism fixes elements in at least two of R,C,E, then its fixed elements form a subsquare of S. Note that the order of a subsquare is at most [formula].

Now let g be one of the 6(n!)3 permutations of [formula] fixing the partition. How many Latin squares admit g as an automorphism? If g doesn't fix the three sets R,C,E, then it fixes at most n cells of any such square (for any fixed cell on ri must also be on cj, if g(ri) = cj, and ri and cj determine a unique cell; similar arguments in the other cases). If g is not the identity but fixes the three sets then, as remarked earlier, it fixes at most [formula] cells. For [formula], we have [formula].

Let r be the number of fixed cells (determined by their rows and columns). We may choose their entries in at most nr ways. Any choice of entry for a non-fixed cell determines all the cells in its orbit under g; so there are at most [formula] of these. So the number of fixed squares is at most [formula].

Hence the number of Latin squares admitting non-trivial automorphisms is at most [formula].

Steiner triple systems

The number of Steiner triple systems of admissible order n is at least n(1 - ε)n2 / 6 for sufficiently large n (combining Wilson's results [\cite=8] with those of Bang and Friedland).

Let g be a non-identity automorphism of a Steiner triple system S of order n, and suppose g fixes m points. The fixed points carry a subsystem of S, so [formula]. This subsystem contains m(m - 1) / 6 fixed blocks. Any other point lies in at most one fixed block, so at most [formula] further blocks are fixed. The total number of fixed blocks is thus at most (n2 + 2n - 9) / 24, and the number r of block-orbits satisfies

[formula]

Now take a permutation g on the set of points. Choose triples for the blocks of a Steiner triple system admitting g in such a way that, when any new block is chosen, its entire orbit under g is included. The number of such sequences of blocks is at most [formula]; so the number of Steiner triple systems is at most [formula].

Now (a / x)x is an increasing function of x for [formula]; so, since r  ≤  5n2 / 48, we have that [formula]. Hence the number of Steiner triple systems admitting non-trivial automorphisms is at most [formula].

Edge-parallelisms

The structures considered here are sometimes referred to as 1-factorisations or minimal edge-colourings of complete graphs; they are partitions of the 2-subsets of an n-set X into "parallel classes", each of which partitions X. For a general reference, see [\cite=2]. It follows from [\cite=2] together with the result of Bang and Friedland that, if n is admissible (that is, even), the number of edge-parallelisms of order n is at least n(1 - ε)n2 / 2 for n  ≥  n0(ε).

We need the fact that the number of 1-factors of a k-valent graph on n vertices is at most [formula] (see [\cite=2]).

Let Γ be a k-valent graph on n vertices, g an automorphism of Γ with no fixed vertices. Then the number of 1-factors of Γ fixed by g is at most [formula].

Proof

Count fixed 1-factors containing r edges fixed by g. The fixed edges are 2-cycles of g, so there are at most [formula] choices for these. Suppose the non-fixed edges lie in m orbits under g. Choosing these in order, such that each new edge chosen is followed by its orbit, we have at most [formula] choices; hence at most [formula] choices up to permutations of the orbits. As in the last section, this number is greatest when m has its largest possible value [formula], and so it is smaller than [formula]. Now the total number of 1-factors is less than

[formula]

Now we turn to the proof of the theorem. Suppose g is a permutation of an n-set; we want to count edge-parallelisms fixed by g. If g fixes r points, with r > 0, then its fixed points carry a subsystem, whence [formula] ([\cite=2]), and it fixes r - 1 parallel classes (1-factors). So the number of orbits of g on parallel classes satisfies [formula]. There are at most [formula] 1-factors altogether, and so at most n3n2 / 8 fixed edge-parallelisms.

Now suppose that g fixes no points; count fixed edge-parallelisms with s fixed parallel classes. By the lemma, the fixed parallel classes can be chosen in at most [formula] ways. If the remaining classes fall into m orbits, then [formula], and as before there are at most [formula] choices for these. Multiplying, and summing over s, we obtain at most [formula] fixed edge-parallelisms. This number is smaller than n3n2 / 8 for sufficiently large n.

Thus the number of edge-parallelisms admitting non-trivial automorphisms is at most [formula].

Strongly regular graphs

Ray-Chaudhuri [\cite=5] and Neumaier [\cite=4] have shown that all but finitely many strongly regular graphs with least eigenvalue - 3 are of one of the following types:

complete multipartite with block size 3;

a Latin square graph (whose vertices are the cells of a Latin square, two vertices adjacent if the cells agree in row, column or entry);

a Steiner graph (whose vertices are the blocks of a Steiner triple system, two vertices adjacent if the blocks intersect in a point).

For all but finitely many graphs of the second and third type, every graph-automorphism is induced by an automorphism of the Latin square or Steiner triple system. Moreover, all but finitely many strongly regular graphs with least eigenvalue greater than - 3 are complete multipartite with block size 2, or square lattice or triangular graphs (Seidel [\cite=7]).

It follows that, of strongly regular graphs with least eigenvalue - 3 or greater on at most n vertices, the proportion admitting non-trivial automorphisms tends to zero as n  →    ∞  .

It would be interesting to know whether the same assertion holds without the restriction on the least eigenvalue.
