Introduction

In this paper, we consider solutions of an integral equation driven by a nonlocal, linear operator of the form

[formula]

We suppose that K is a measurable and nonnegative kernel, such that K(ζ) = K( - ζ) for a.e. [formula]. We consider both integrable and non-integrable kernels K.

We recall that in the past few years, there has been an intense activity in this type of operators, both for their mathematical interest and for their applications in concrete models. In particular, the fractional operators that we consider here can be seen as a compactly supported version of the fractional Laplacian ( - Δ)s with s∈(0,1) (and possibly arising from a more general kernel, which is not scale invariant and does not possess equivalent extended problems). Also, convolution operators are nowadays very popular, also in relation with biological models, see, among the others [\cite=25] [\cite=26] [\cite=32] [\cite=34].

We consider here solutions u of the semilinear equation

[formula]

Notice that, in the biological framework, the solution u of this equation is often thought as the density of a biological species and the nonlinearity f is a logistic map, which prescribes the birth and death rate of the population. In this setting, the nonlocal diffusion modeled by L is motivated by the long-range interactions between the individuals of the species.

The goal of this paper is to study the symmetry properties of solutions of [\eqref=EQ] in the light of a famous conjecture of De Giorgi arising in elliptic partial differential equations, see [\cite=EDG]. The original problem consisted in the following question:

Let u be a bounded solution of

[formula]

in the whole of [formula], with Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional, i.e. there exist [formula] and [formula] such that [formula], for any [formula], at least when [formula].

The literature has presented several variations of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG]: in particular, a weak form of it has been investigated when the additional assumption

[formula]

is added to the hypotheses. When the limit in [\eqref=LIM] is uniform with respect to the variables [formula], the version of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] obtained in this way is due to Gibbons and is related to problems in cosmology.

In spite of the intense activity of the problem, Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] is still open in its generality. Up to now, Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] is known to have a positive answer in dimension 2 and 3 (see [\cite=AC] [\cite=GG] and also [\cite=AAC] [\cite=BCN]) and a negative answer in dimension 9 and higher (see [\cite=DKW]). Also, the weak form of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] under the limit assumption in [\eqref=LIM] was proved, up to the optimal dimension 8, in [\cite=S] (see also [\cite=FVT] for more general conditions at infinity), and the version of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] under a uniform limit assumption in [\eqref=LIM] holds true in any dimension (see [\cite=BBG] [\cite=BHM] [\cite=F]). Since it is almost impossible to keep track in this short introduction of all the research developed on this important topic, we refer to [\cite=FV] for further details and motivations.

The goal of this paper is to investigate whether results in the spirit of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] hold true when the Laplace operator is replaced by the nonlocal operator in [\eqref=OP]. We remark that symmetry results in nonlocal settings have been obtained in [\cite=CC1] [\cite=CC2] [\cite=CS2] [\cite=CS3] [\cite=CSM] [\cite=LV] [\cite=SV], but all these works dealt with fractional operators with scaling properties at the origin and at infinity (and somehow with nice regularizing effects).

Also, some of the problems considered in the previous works rely on an extension property of the operator that brings the problem into a local (though higher dimensional and either singular or degenerate) problem (see however [\cite=bucur] [\cite=CSV] where symmetry results for fractional problems have been obtained without extension techniques).

In this sense, as far as we know, this paper is the first one to take into account kernels that are compactly supported, for which the above regularization techniques do not always hold and for which equivalent local problems are not available. Moreover, the strategy used in our proof is different from the ones already exploited in the nonlocal setting, since it relies directly on a technique introduced by [\cite=BCN] and refined in [\cite=AC], which reduced the symmetry property of the level sets of a solution to a Liouville type property for an associated equation (of course, differently from the classical case, we will have to deal with equations, and in fact inequalities, of integral type, in which the appropriate simplifications are more involved).

In this paper, we prove the following one-dimensional result in dimension 2. The case of dimension 3, following the approach of Ambrosio and Cabré in the local case for instance would require deeper analysis of optimal energy estimates. Here, and throughout the paper, Br denotes the open Euclidean ball with radius r > 0 and centered at the origin, Br(x) = x + Br, and χE denotes the characteristic function of a set E.

Let n = 2 and let L be an operator of the form [\eqref=OP], with K satisfying either

[formula]

or

[formula]

for any [formula], for some fixed M0  ≥  m0 > 0, R0  ≥  r0 > 0, and 0 < s < 1 in [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac]. Let u be a solution of [\eqref=EQ], with [formula] and [formula]. Assume that

[formula]

Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional.

The assumptions in [\eqref=ASS-kernel] and [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac] correspond, respectively, to the case of an integrable kernel of convolution type and to the case of a cutoff fractional kernel. For the existence and further properties of one-dimensional solutions of [\eqref=EQ] under quite general conditions, see Theorem 3.1(b) in [\cite=Bates], and [\cite=ch] [\cite=co]. As far as assumption [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac] is concerned, there is no direct reference on the existence of one-dimensional solutions. However, an adaptation of the techniques in [\cite=Palatucci-Savin-Valdinoci] could lead to such a result.

We recall that if condition [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac] (or, more generally, (H1) below) is assumed, one needs to interpret [\eqref=OP] in the principal value sense, i.e., as customary,

[formula]

As a matter of fact, our proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2] does not use any special structure of the kernel K, but only relies on the following facts: the kernel K has compact support, and the operator L satisfies a Harnack inequality. More precisely, we need:

The operator L is of the form [\eqref=OP], with the kernel K satisfying K  ≥  0, K(ζ) = K( - ζ) and K(ζ)  ≥  m0χBr0(ζ) in [formula] for some m0 > 0 and r0 > 0. Moreover, K has compact support in BR0 for some R0 > 0, that is,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The operator L satisfies the following Harnack inequality: if φ is continuous and positive in [formula] and is a weak solution to Lφ + c(x)φ = 0 in BR, with c(x)∈L∞(B1) and [formula], then

[formula]

for some constant C depending on L and b, but independent of φ.

Under these assumptions, we have the following.

Let n = 2, let L be an operator of the form [\eqref=OP], with K and L satisfying  and , and let u be a solution of [\eqref=EQ], with [formula] and [formula]. Assume that If K is not integrable, assume in addition that [formula]. Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional.

When [\eqref=ASS-kernel] holds, then (H2) follows from the results of Coville (more precisely, Corollary 1.7 in [\cite=Coville]). Similarly, when [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac] is in force, then (H2) follows from a suitable generalization of the results in [\cite=DKP] (see Remark [\ref=TBD] below). Thus, thanks to the results in [\cite=Coville] [\cite=DKP], Theorem [\ref=DG-2] follows from Theorem [\ref=DG-3] --the only difference being the regularity assumed on the solution u.

Notice that when the kernel K is non-integrable at the origin, then one expects the operator L to be regularizing, and thus bounded solutions u to [\eqref=EQ] to be at least C1 (recall that f is [formula]). Moreover, when f is smooth, then u is expected to be smooth. However, in case that K is integrable at the origin as in ([\ref=ASS-kernel]), then it is not clear if all bounded solutions are in [formula], and this is why we need to take this assumption in Theorem [\ref=DG-2].

Harnack inequalities for general nonlocal operators L have been widely studied and are known for different classes of kernels K; see for instance a rather general form of the Harnack inequality in [\cite=DKP]. Notice that in our case, we need a Harnack inequality with a zero order term in the equation. It has been proved when the integral operator is the pure fractional Laplacian in [\cite=CS1] and refined in [\cite=TX]. It is by now well known that the Harnack inequality may fail depending on the kernel K under consideration, and a characterization of the classes of kernels for which it holds is out of the scope of this paper. Notice indeed that condition [\eqref=ASS-kernel] is stronger than (H1), but under the general assumption (H1) then the Harnack inequality in (H2) is not known, and thus needs to be assumed in Theorem [\ref=DG-3].

The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3]. In particular, Section [\ref=PF] will present the proof these results, making use of suitable algebraic identities and a Liouville type result in a nonlocal setting. Then, in Section [\ref=EXT] we will consider the extension of Theorem [\ref=DG-3] to stable (instead of monotone) solutions, giving also a variational characterization of stability.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3]

The proofs of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3] are exactly the same. We will prove them at the same time. The first step towards the proof of these results is a suitable algebraic computation, that we express in this result:

Let u be as in Theorem [formula] or [formula]. Let ui: = ∂xiu, for i∈{1,2}, and

[formula]

Also, let [formula]. Then

[formula]

First, notice that in case [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac], since f∈C1,α then [formula]. This means that in all cases --either [\eqref=ASS-kernel] or [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac] or (H1)--, the derivatives ui are regular enough so that Lui is well defined pointwise, and hence all the following integrals converge.

We observe that, for any g and h regular enough,

[formula]

By [\eqref=EQ], we have that

[formula]

Accordingly,

[formula]

By subtracting these two identities and using [\eqref=DF:v], we obtain

[formula]

Now, we multiply the previous equality by 2τ2v and we integrate over [formula]. Recalling [\eqref=R1] together with vu2, we conclude that By writing

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

In the same way, if we write

[formula]

we get that

[formula]

By [\eqref=XR-2] and [\eqref=XR-3], after a simplification we obtain that

[formula]

Now we notice that

[formula]

and so

[formula]

This proves [\eqref=ALG-1].

Now we use a Liouville type approach to prove that solutions v of the integral equation in [\eqref=ALG-1] are necessarily constant (and this is the only step in which the assumption that the ambient space is [formula] plays a crucial role):

Let u be as in Theorem [formula] or [formula], and let v = u1 / u2. Then v is constant.

First, by the previous Lemma v satisfies [\eqref=ALG-1] for all [formula].

Let R > 1, to be taken arbitrarily large in the sequel. Let τ: = τR∈C∞0(B2R), such that [formula] in [formula], τ = 1 in BR and

[formula]

for some C > 0 independent of R > 1. Throughout the proof, C will denote a positive constant which may change from a line to another, but which is independent of R > 1. Using [\eqref=ALG-1], and recalling [\eqref=ASS-kernel], [\eqref=mono] and the support properties of τ, we observe that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Moreover, making use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we see that

[formula]

Now we notice that

[formula]

for any (x,y)∈RR, for a suitable C > 0, possibly depending on R0 but independent of R > 1 and (x,y)∈RR. This is a consequence of [\eqref=5bis] with [formula] and of assumption (H2) applied recursively to some shifts of the continuous and positive function u2.

From [\eqref=tau], [\eqref=HA] and the assumption [formula], we obtain that, for any (x,y)∈RR,

[formula]

for some C > 0 independent of R > 1 (the constant C in the last term may be larger than the one in the second term). Hence, by [\eqref=ASS-kernel], (H1) and the symmetry in the (x,y) variables,

[formula]

for some C > 0. Therefore, recalling [\eqref=J22],

[formula]

Hence, since

[formula]

we can use the symmetric role played by x and y in [\eqref=J23] and obtain that

[formula]

up to renaming C > 0. So, we insert this information into [\eqref=J24] and we conclude that

[formula]

for some C > 0.

Since [formula] and u2 and K are nonnegative, we can simplify the estimate in [\eqref=J25] by writing

[formula]

In particular, since τ = 1 in BR,

[formula]

Since C is independent of R, we can send R  →    +    ∞   in this estimate and obtain that the map

[formula]

belongs to [formula].

Using this and the fact that RR approaches the empty set as R  →    +    ∞  , we conclude from Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem that

[formula]

Therefore, going back to [\eqref=J25] and recalling the properties of τ  =  τR,

[formula]

This and [\eqref=mono] imply that [formula] for a.e. [formula]. Hence, recalling assumption (H1), we have that v(x) = v(y) for any [formula] and any y∈Br0(x). As a consequence, the set [formula] is open and closed in [formula], and so, by connectedness, we obtain that v is constant.

By combining Lemmata [\ref=L-A-1] and [\ref=Lio], we can finish the proof of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3]:

Using first Lemma [\ref=L-A-1] and then Lemma [\ref=Lio], we obtain that v is constant, where v is as in [\eqref=DF:v]. Let us say that v(x) = a for some [formula]. So we define [formula] and we observe that

[formula]

Thus, if ω  ·  y = 0 then

[formula]

Therefore, if we set [formula] for any [formula], and we write any [formula] as

[formula]

with ω  ·  yx = 0, we conclude that

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-3].

It is an interesting open problem to investigate if symmetry results in the spirit of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3] hold true in higher dimension.

Stable solutions and extension of the main results

We discuss here the extension of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3] to the more general context of bounded stable solutions u of [\eqref=EQ] in the whole space [formula] with n  ≥  2. In the case of second order equations, there are two equivalent definitions of stability: a variational one and a non-variational one. In case of nonlocal operators [\eqref=OP], these two different definitions read as follows.

The following inequality holds

[formula]

for every [formula]. That is, the second variation of the energy functional associated to [\eqref=EQ] is nonnegative under perturbations with compact support in [formula].

There exists a positive continuous solution φ > 0 to the linearized equation

[formula]

For completeness, we observe that a more general version of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3] holds true, namely if we replace assumption [\eqref=mono] with the following non-variational stability condition (S2).

Let n = 2 and L be an operator of the form [\eqref=OP], with K satisfying either [\eqref=ASS-kernel], or [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac], or -. Let u be a solution of [\eqref=EQ], with [formula] and [formula], and with [formula] in case -. Assume that u is stable, in the sense of . Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional.

Notice that, in this setting, Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-3] are a particular case of Theorem [\ref=DG-2-STAB], choosing φ: = u2  =  ∂x2u and recalling [\eqref=5bis].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2-STAB] is exactly the one of Theorem [\ref=DG-3], with only a technical difference: instead of [\eqref=DF:v], one has to define, for i∈{1,2},

[formula]

Then the proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-3] goes through (replacing u2 with φ when necessary) and implies that v is constant, i.e. ui = aiφ, for some [formula]. This gives that [formula], which in turn implies the one-dimensional symmetry of u.

Given the result in Theorem [\ref=DG-2-STAB], we discuss next the equivalence between the two definitions of stability (S1) and (S2). We will always assume that the kernel K satisfies assumption .

Let n  ≥  1 and L be any operator of the form [\eqref=OP]. Let u be a bounded solution of [\eqref=EQ] in the whole of [formula] with [formula]. Assume that the kernel K satisfies assumption . Then, [formula] .

Let [formula]. Using ξ2  /  φ as a test function in the equation Lφ = f'(u)φ, we find

[formula]

Next, we use [\eqref=R1] (which holds in [formula] as in [formula]) to see that at least at the formal level for any function v and w such that Lw is well defined and v belongs to [formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

We find (recall that φ is such that Lφ exists and ξ is compactly supported)

[formula]

Now, it is immediate to check that

[formula]

and this yields

[formula]

Let us now show that

[formula]

Once this is proved, then we will have

[formula]

and thus the result will be proved.

To establish [\eqref=volem], it is convenient to write Θ as

[formula]

Now, using the inequality

[formula]

we find

[formula]

But since

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Hence [\eqref=volem] is proved, and the result follows.

Notice that the previous proposition holds for any operator of the form [\eqref=OP], with no additional assumptions on K. However, we do not know if the two stability conditions (S1) and (S2) are equivalent for all operators L. Indeed, in order to show the other implication (S1) [formula] (S2), we need some additional assumptions. Namely, we need:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using [\eqref=H3.1]-[\eqref=H3.2], we have the following.

Let n  ≥  1 and L be any operator of the form [\eqref=OP] with kernel K satisfying [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac]. Let u be any bounded solution of [\eqref=EQ] in the whole of [formula], with [formula]. Then, [formula]

Let R > 0 and consider the quadratic form

[formula]

for [formula]. Let [formula] be as in [\eqref=H3.2] and λR be the infimum of QR among the class SR defined by

[formula]

Since the functional QR is bounded from below in SR (recall that f'(u) is bounded) and thanks to the compactness assumption in [\eqref=H3.2], we see that its infimum λR is attained for a function φR∈SR. Moreover, by assumption (S1), we have

[formula]

Also, we can assume that φR  ≥  0, since if φ is minimizer then |φ| is also a minimizer. Thus, the function [formula] is a solution, not identically zero, of the problem

[formula]

It follows from the strong maximum principle for integro-differential operators (remember that K satisfies [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac]) that φR is continuous in [formula] and φR > 0 in BR. On the other hand, for any 0 < R < R' we have

[formula]

The equality above is a consequence of [\eqref=R1] (in [formula]), while the inequality follows from the fact that φR = 0 in [formula], and thus LφR < 0 in that annulus. Hence, using the equations for φR and φR' we deduce that

[formula]

Therefore, λR'  <  λR for any R' > R > 0. From this and [\eqref=XC], it follows that λR > 0 for all R > 0.

Now consider the problem

[formula]

for any fixed cR > 0. The solution to this problem can be found by writing ψR  =  φR - cR, which solves

[formula]

It is immediate to check that the energy functional associated to this last problem is bounded from below and coercive, thanks to the inequality λR > 0. Therefore, ψR and φR exist.

Next we claim that φR > 0 in BR. To show this, we use φ-R as a test function for the equation for φR. We find

[formula]

Now, since

[formula]

this yields

[formula]

Since λR > 0, this means that φ-R vanishes identically, and thus [formula]. Since K satisfies [\eqref=ASS-kernel-frac], φR is then continuous and positive in [formula]. The above arguments also imply that the solution φR of [\eqref=varphiR] is unique, whence (1 / cR)φR is actually independent of R > 0. Therefore, one can choose the constant cR > 0 so that φR(0) = 1. Then, by the Hölder regularity in [\eqref=H3.1] and the Harnack inequality in (H2), we have that, for a sequence [formula], the functions φRk converge to a continuous function φ > 0 in [formula] and satisfying [\eqref=linear].
