A note on semisymmetry Aleksandar Krape and Zoran Petri

Abstract. A survey of properties of the adjunction involving a semisymmetrization functor, which was suggested by J.D.H. Smith, and which maps the category of quasigroups with homotopies to the category of semisymmetric quasigroups with homomorphisms, is given. A new semisymmetrization functor is suggested. This functor maps a quasigroup to its square instead to its cube as it was the case with the former functor.

Introduction

For a plausible category of quasigroups, it seems that homotopies between quasigroups, taken as morphisms, are better choice than homomorphisms (see [\cite=Gvaramiya]). However, homomorphisms are sometimes easier to work with. For example, isotopies do not preserve units--every quasigroup is isotopic to a loop (quasigroup with a unit) but is not necessarily a loop itself. This note is about turning homotopies into homomorphisms.

Smith, [\cite=Smith], proved that there is an adjunction from the category of semisymmetric quasigroups with homomorphisms to the category of quasigroups with homotopies. Also, he proved in [\cite=Smith] that the latter category is isomorphic to a subcategory of the former category, and in [\cite=Smith8], that every T algebra, for T being the monad defined by the above adjunction, is isomorphic to the image of a semisymmetric quasigroup under the comparison functor.

These results, especially the embedding of the category of quasigroups with homotopies into the category of semisymmetric quasigroups with homomorphisms, could be of interest to a working universal algebraist. Our intention is to make them more accessible to such a reader and to indicate a possible misusing. Also, we make some alternative proofs and add the fullness of the comparison functor in order to complete the picture of this adjoint situation.

At the end of the paper, we show that there is a more economical way to embed the category of quasigroups with homotopies into the category of semisymmetric quasigroups with homomorphisms. One could get an impression, due to [\cite=Smith], that for such an embedding it is necessary to have a semisymmetrization functor that is a right adjoint in an adjunction. If one is interested just in this embedding and not in reflectivity (see the end of Section [\ref=adj]), then this new semisymmetrization suits as any other.

We assume that the reader is familiar with the notions of category, functor and natural transformation. If not, we suggest to consult [\cite=ML71] for these notions. All other relevant notions from Category theory are introduced at the appropriate places in the text.

Quasigroups

We start by recapitulating a few basic facts about quasigroups. One way to define a quasigroup is that it is a grupoid (Q;  ·  ) satisfying:

[formula]

Uniqueness of the solution of the equation x  ·  a  =  b  (a  ·  x  =  b) enables one to define right (left) division operation [formula] which is also a quasigroup (short for: (Q; / ) is a quasigroup). We can define three more operations:

[formula]

dual to [formula] respectively. They are also quasigroups. The six operations [formula] and [formula] are parastrophes of ·   (and of each other).

A function f:Q  →  R between the base sets of quasigroups (Q;  ·  ) and (R,  ·  ) is a homomorphism iff:

[formula]

and isomorphism if f is a bijection as well.

A triple   =  (f1,f2,f3) of functions (fi:Q  →  R) is a homotopy iff:

[formula]

which implies (and is implied by any of): If all three components of [formula] are bijections, then [formula] is an isotopy.

***

We can also define a quasigroup as an algebra [formula] with three binary operations: multiplication (·  ), right and left division. The axioms that a quasigroup satisfies are (xy is short for (x  ·  y)):

[formula]

For obvious reasons, such quasigroups are called equational, primitive or equasigroups.

Thus, we have the variety of all quasigroups. Another important variety is the variety of semisymmetric quasigroups, defined by one of the following five equivalent axioms (in addition to (Q)):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Smith, [\cite=Smith], defined a semisymmetrization of a quasigroup [formula] as a one-operation quasigroup [formula] where the binary operation [formula] is defined by:

[formula]

and proved that, for any quasigroup [formula], the semisymmetrization [formula] of [formula] is a semisymmetric quasigroup.

Twisted quasigroups

For our purpose, there is a better way to define a quasigroup. In this definition the twisted quasigroup is an algebra [formula] satisfying appropriate paraphrasing of the above quasigroup axioms (Q):

We have the following symmetry result, lacking for quasigroups defined as [formula].

An algebra [formula] is a twisted quasigroup iff [formula] is a twisted quasigroup iff [formula] is a twisted quasigroup.

Analogously, we have the paraphrasing of axioms for twisted semisymmetric quasigroups: ([\ref=eq:SS1]),([\ref=eq:SS2]) and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The last three identities we shorten to symbolic identities: [formula].

There is also a result corresponding to Proposition [\ref=TQ]:

An algebra [formula] is a semisymmetric twisted quasigroup iff [formula] is a semisymmetric twisted quasigroup iff [formula] is a semisymmetric twisted quasigroup.

***

Using twisted quasigroups we can see how a (twisted) semisymmetrization (defined below), which we call [formula], 'works'.

Let us start with three single-operation quasigroups (Q;  ·  ),(Q;  /     / ) and [formula], where /      /   and [formula] are duals of appropriate division operations of ·  . We can define direct (Cartesian) product [formula] and an operation [formula] on Q3 such that

[formula]

defines multiplication in the direct product. Therefore [formula] is a quasigroup.

Define also a permutation ':Q3  →  Q3 by (x1,x2,x3)'  =  (x2,x3,x1). It follows that (x1,x2,x3)''  =  (x3,x1,x2) and (x1,x2,x3)'''  =  (x1,x2,x3). Define another operation [formula] by [formula], where ū = (u1,u2,u3). The groupoid [formula] is also a quasigroup, so there are appropriate division operations of [formula] and their duals [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

Therefore [formula] is a twisted quasigroup.

Let us calculate [formula]. [formula] [formula] [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

i.e. [formula] (and consequently [formula]) hence [formula] is semisymmetric twisted quasigroup. So we recognize [formula] as a twisted analogue of Smith's [formula] (see identity ([\ref=eq:SSprod])). Let us call [formula] a twisted semisymmetrization of [formula].

For (f1,f2,f3) being a homotopy from [formula] to [formula], we also have: [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula], so f1  ×  f2  ×  f3 is a homomorphism.

Biquasigroups

An algebra [formula] is a biquasigroup iff [formula] is the dual of the right (left) division operation of a quasigroup operation ·  .

A biquasigroup is semisymmetric iff [formula].

An algebra [formula] is a biquasigroup iff [formula] is a biquasigroup iff [formula] is a biquasigroup.

An algebra [formula] is a semisymmetric biquasigroup iff [formula] is a semisymmetric biquasigroup iff [formula] is a semisymmetric biquasigroup.

***

Let us start with three single-operation quasigroups (Q;  ·  ),(Q;  /     / ) and [formula], where /      /   and [formula] are duals of appropriate division operations of ·  . We can define direct (Cartesian) product [formula] and an operation [formula] on Q2 such that

[formula]

defines multiplication in the direct product. Therefore [formula] is a quasigroup.

Define also a permutation ':Q2  →  Q2 by (x1,x2)'  =  (x2,x1). Define another operation [formula] by [formula], where û is (u1,u2), Lx̂(ŷ)  =  (x1  ·  y1,y2) and Rŷ(x̂)  =  (x1,x2  ·  y2). The groupoid [formula] is also a quasigroup, moreover a semisymmetric one. Therefore [formula] is a semisymmetric biquasigroup.

Let us define:

[formula]

Then the definition of [formula], which we abbreviate just by [formula], is:

[formula]

There are two more alternative semisymmetrizations with corresponding definitions in [formula] (respectively (Q2;  ·  ,  /     / )):

[formula]

[formula]

The indexing of operations is used to emphasize the symmetry. These semisymmetrizations are object functions of functors related to a functor explained in details in Section [\ref=new].

The categories Qtp and P

This section follows the lines of [\cite=Smith] with some adjustments. The main novelty is a proof of [\cite=Smith]. We try to keep to the notation introduced in [\cite=Smith]. However, we write functions and functors to the left of their arguments.

Let Qtp be the category with objects all small quasigroups [formula] and arrows all homotopies. The identity homotopy on [formula] is the triple (Q,Q,Q), where Q is the identity function on Q, and the composition of homotopies

[formula]

is the homotopy

[formula]

Let P be the category with objects all small semisymmetric quasigroups and arrows all quasigroup homomorphisms. For every arrow [formula] of P, the triple (f,f,f) is a homotopy between [formula] and [formula].

Let Σ be a functor from P to Qtp, which is identity on objects. Moreover, let Σf, for a homomorphism f, be the homotopy (f,f,f).

The category P is a full subcategory of the category Q with objects all small quasigroups and arrows all quasigroup homomorphisms. The functor Σ is just a restriction of a functor from Q to Qtp, which is defined in the same manner.

An adjunction is given by two functors, F :  →   and G :  →  , and two natural transformations, the unit [formula] and the counit [formula], such that for every object C of [formula] and every object D of [formula]

[formula]

These two equalities are called triangular identities. The functor F is a left adjoint for the functor G, while G is a right adjoint for the functor F.

That Σ :  →   has a right adjoint is shown as follows. Let /      /   and [formula] be defined as at the beginning of Section [\ref=Q]. For [formula] a quasigroup, let [formula] be defined as in Section [\ref=twist], i.e. for every x̄ = (x1,x2,x3) and  = (y1,y2,y3)

[formula]

That [formula] is a semisymmetric quasigroup follows from the fact that the structure [formula] is a semisymmetric twisted quasigroup, which is shown in Section [\ref=twist]. The semisymmetric quasigroup [formula] is the semisymmetrization [formula] of [formula] defined at the end of Section [\ref=Q] (see ([\ref=eq:SSprod])).

Let Δ :  →   be a functor, which maps a quasigroup [formula] to the semisymmetric quasigroup [formula]. A homotopy (f1,f2,f3) is mapped by Δ to the product f1  ×  f2  ×  f3, which is a homomorphism as it is shown at the end of Section [\ref=twist]. By the functoriality of product, we have that Δ preserves identities and composition, and it is indeed a functor.

The functor Δ is a right adjoint for Σ.

For [formula] an object of P, let [formula] be a function defined so that for every x∈P, [formula]. Note that [formula] is a homomorphism from [formula] to [formula], i.e. an arrow of P, since

[formula]

(This is why we consider just a restriction Σ of a functor from Q to Qtp. For an object [formula] of Q, the function defined as [formula] need not be a homomorphism.)

Let η be the family

[formula]

This family is a natural transformation from the identity functor on P to the composition ΔΣ since for every arrow [formula] of P and every x∈P, we have

[formula]

For [formula] an object of Qtp and i∈{1,2,3}, let πi :Q3  →  Q be the ith projection. Let [formula] be the triple (π1,π2,π3), which is a homotopy from [formula] to [formula], since

[formula]

Hence, [formula] is an arrow of Qtp.

Let ε be the family

[formula]

This family is a natural transformation from the composition ΣΔ to the identity functor on Qtp since for every arrow [formula] of Qtp and every x̄ from [formula], we have

[formula]

Eventually, we have to show that the following triangular identities hold for every object [formula] of Qtp and every object [formula] of P

[formula]

For every x̄∈Q3, we have [formula] [formula] =  x̄. For every x∈P and every i∈{1,2,3}, we have [formula].

Moreover, every component of the counit of this adjunction is epi (i.e. right cancellable) and the semisymmetrization is one-one. This is sufficent for Qtp to be isomorphic to a subcategory of P. This is one way how to establish this fact using the previous proposition. It is not clear to us how this fact is obtained as a corollary of the corresponding proposition in [\cite=Smith]. However, if the goal was just to establish that Qtp is isomorphic to a subcategory of P, this adjunction is not necessary at all, which will be also shown.

A functor F :  →   is faithful when for every pair [formula] of arrows of C, Ff = Fg implies f = g. An arrow f :A  →  B of C is epi when for every pair g,h :B  →  C of arrows of C, the equality [formula] implies g = h. The following lemmata will help us to prove that Qtp is isomorphic to a subcategory of P.

The functor Δ is faithful.

By [\cite=ML71] (see also [\cite=D14] for an elegant proof of a related result) it suffices to prove that for every object [formula] of Qtp, the arrow [formula] is epi.

Let [formula] be a pair of arrows of Qtp such that [formula]. This means that for every i∈{1,2,3} we have that [formula]. Hence, the function gi is equal to the function hi, since the function πi is right cancellable. (However, the homotopy [formula] need not have a right inverse in Qtp.)

The second proof of this lemma is direct and does not rely on Proposition [\ref=adjunction]. Simply, for homotopies (f1,f2,f3) and (g1,g2,g3) from [formula] to [formula], if f1  ×  f2  ×  f3 and g1  ×  g2  ×  g3 are equal as homomorphisms from [formula] to [formula] in P, then for every i∈{1,2,3}, fi = gi. Hence, these homotopies are equal in Qtp.

If [formula] and [formula] are two different quasigroups, then there are x,y∈Q such that

[formula]

Suppose that for every x,y∈Q, x  ·  y = x  ·  'y holds. Then for every z,t∈Q we have

[formula]

Analogously, we prove that for every u,v∈Q, [formula]. Hence, [formula] and [formula] are the same, which contradicts the assumption.

The functor Δ is one-one on objects.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are two different quasigroups. If Q and Q' are different sets, then [formula] and [formula] are different. If Q = Q', then, by Lemma [\ref=dif], there are x and y in this set such that x  ·  y  ≠  x  ·  'y. Hence, the operations [formula] for [formula] and [formula] differ when applied to (x,x,x) and (y,y,y).

As a corollary of these two lemmata we have the following result.

The category is isomorphic to a subcategory of ; namely, to its image under the functor Δ.

As we have shown by the second proof of Lemma [\ref=Dfaith], Proposition [\ref=embedding] is independent of Proposition [\ref=adjunction]. The adjunction, together with this embedding of Qtp in P, says that the category P reflects in Qtp in the following sense. A subcategory A of B is reflective in B, when the inclusion functor from A to B has a left adjoint called a reflector. The adjunction is called a reflection of B in A.

Propositions [\ref=adjunction] and [\ref=embedding] say that Qtp may be considered as a reflective subcategory of P. The functor Σ is a reflector and the adjunction between Σ and Δ is a reflection of P in Qtp. However, this does not mean that two quasigroups are isotopic in Qtp if and only if their semisymmetrizations are isomorphic in P, which one may conclude from [\cite=ImKoSm]. The reader should be aware of this potential missusing of these results.

Monadicity of Δ

For F :  →   a left adjoint for G :  →  , and η and ε, the unit and counit of this adjunction, a GF-algebra is a pair (C,h), where C is an object of C and h :GFC  →  C is an arrow of C such that the following equalities hold.

[formula]

A morphism of GF-algebras (C,h) and (C',h') is given by an arrow f :C  →  C' of C such that [formula].

The category GF has GF-algebras as objects and morphisms of GF-algebras as arrows. The comparison functor K :  →  GF is given by

[formula]

In many cases the comparison functor is an isomorphism or an equivalence (i.e. there is a functor from GF to D such that both compositions with K are naturally isomorphic to the identity functors). The right adjoint of an adjunction or an adjunction are called monadic when the comparison functor is an isomorphism (see [\cite=ML71], also [\cite=SR99]). Some other authors (see [\cite=BW85]) call an adjunction monadic (tripleable) when K is just an equivalence.

In the case of adjoint situation involving Σ and Δ, the comparison functor K :  →  ΔΣ is just an equivalence. To prove this, by [\cite=ML71] it suffices to prove that K is full and faithful, and that every GF-algebra is isomorphic to [formula] for some quasigroup [formula]. The faithfulness of K follows from [\ref=Dfaith] since the arrow function K coincides with the arrow function Δ. That every GF-algebra is isomorphic to [formula] for some quasigroup [formula] is proven in [\cite=Smith8].

A functor F :  →   is full when for every pair of objects C1 and C2 of [formula] and every arrow g :FC1  →  FC2 of [formula] there is an arrow f :C1  →  C2 of [formula] such that g = Ff. It remains to prove that K is full. For this we use the following lemma.

Every arrow of ΔΣ from [formula] to [formula] is of the form f1  ×  f2  ×  f3, for (f1,f2,f3) a homotopy from [formula] to [formula].

For quasigroups [formula] and [formula] we have that [formula] and [formula]. So, let

[formula]

be an arrow of ΔΣ. Since f is a morphism of ΔΣ-algebras, we have that

[formula]

as functions from (Q3)3 to R3.

For i∈{1,2,3} and u∈Q, let fi(u) = πi(f(u,u,u)). Let (x,y,z) be an arbitrary element of Q3. Apply the both sides of the above equality to ((x,x,x),(y,y,y),(z,z,z))∈(Q3)3 in order to obtain f(x,y,z) = (π1(f(x,x,x)),π2(f(y,y,y)),π3(f(z,z,z))) = (f1(x),f2(y),f3(z)). Hence, f = f1  ×  f2  ×  f3 and since it is a homomorphism from [formula] to [formula], we have for every x̄,∈Q3

[formula]

By restricting this equality to the third component, we obtain f1(x1)  ·  f2(y2) = f3(x1  ·  y2), and hence (f1,f2,f3) is a homotopy from [formula] to [formula].

A new semisymmetrization

In this section we introduce a new semisymmetrization functor from Qtp to P. This leads to another subcategory of P isomorphic to Qtp. We start with an auxiliary result.

The third component f3 of a homotopy is determined by the first two components f1 and f2.

Let [formula] be a quasigroup. For every element x∈Q there are y,z∈Q such that x = y  ·  z (e.g. [formula]). Hence, f3(x) = f1(y)  ·  f2(z).

Let Γ :  →   be a functor defined on objects so that [formula] is a semisymmetric quasigroup [formula] (see Section [\ref=biq]) whose elements are pairs (x1,x2), abbreviated by x̂, and [formula] is defined so that

[formula]

(It is straightforward to check that [formula], hence [formula] is a semisymmetric quasigroup.)

A homotopy (f1,f2,f3) is mapped by Γ to the product f1  ×  f2, which is a homomorphism: [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula]. By the functoriality of product, we have that Γ preserves identities and composition, and it is indeed a functor.

The functor Γ is not a right adjoint for Σ since a right adjoint is unique up to isomorphism and [formula] is not isomorphic to [formula] for every object [formula] of Qtp. However, this adjunction is not necessary for the faithfulness of Γ.

The functor Γ is faithful.

We proceed as in the second proof of Lemma [\ref=Dfaith]. If (f1,f2,f3) and (g1,g2,g3) are two homotopies from [formula] to [formula], then Γ(f1,f2,f3) = Γ(g1,g2,g3) means that f1  ×  f2 = g1  ×  g2. Hence, f1 = g1 and f2 = g2, and by Lemma [\ref=homotopy], f3 = g3.

The functor Γ, as defined, is not one-one on objects. For example,

[formula]

where +   is addition mod 2 and [formula], are mapped by Γ to the same object of P. To remedy this matter, one may redefine Γ so that

[formula]

where [formula], as the third component of every element, guarantees that Γ is one-one on objects. The operation [formula] is defined as above, just neglecting the third component. Hence, Qtp may be considered as another subcategory of P.
