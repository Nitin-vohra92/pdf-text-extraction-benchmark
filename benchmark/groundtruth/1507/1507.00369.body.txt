On a Conjecture on the Representation of Positive Integers as the Sum of Three Terms of the Sequence [formula]

Theorem Corollary Conjecture Observation Definition

Introduction

In the following we let [formula] denote the set of non-negative integers, [formula] is the integer part function, and [formula] is the fractional part function.

A classical result by Legendre [\cite=threeSquare] states that every natural number not of the form [formula] can be written as the sum of three squares.

In relation to this Farhi recently conjectured the following:

Let [formula] be an integer. Then every natural number can be represented as the sum of three terms of the sequence [formula].

The conjecture was confirmed by Farhi [\cite=Farhi1] and Mezroui, Azizi, and Ziane [\cite=analyt] for a∈{3,4,8}.

In this paper we generalize the method used by Farhi for a = 4, and partially for a = 3, to prove that the conjecture holds for a∈{4, 7, 8, 9, 20, 24, 40, 104, 120}. The method uses Legendre's three-square theorem and properties of quadratic residues.

We also note that the set of integers, a, such that Conjecture [\ref=main] holds is closed under multiplication by a square.

Method and results

We start by introducing the following sets:

For any nonzero [formula] we define

[formula]

Therefore, Qa is the set of quadratic residues modulo a.

For any nonzero [formula] we define

[formula]

Thus, Aa is the set of integers that can be written as the sum of three elements of [formula].

For any nonzero [formula] we define

[formula]

So, Ra is the set of integers that can be written as the sum of three elements of [formula], and such that no other integer in the same residue class modulo a has this property.

Now, we are ready to formulate the main result.

Let [formula] be nonzero and assume that for every [formula] there exists an r∈Ra such that ak + r  ≠  4s(8t + 7) for any [formula]. Then every [formula] can be written as the sum of three terms of the sequence [formula].

Let [formula] be fixed. By assumption we can choose r∈Ra such that aN + r  ≠  4s(8t + 7) for any [formula]. By Legendre's theorem it follows that aN + r can be written of the form

[formula]

for some [formula]. Now we have so

[formula]

since r∈Ra. Dividing by a and separating the integer and fractional parts of the right hand side in [\eqref=eq], we get and from [\eqref=red] we have

[formula]

so

[formula]

Since we can find the sets Ra by computation, we can now apply the main theorem to get the following corollary.

Conjecture [\ref=main] is satisfied for a∈{4,7,8,9,20,24,40,104,120}.

Consider the following table:

Calculating modulo 8 it can be checked fairly easily that for each a∈{4, 7, 8, 9, 20, 24, 40, 104, 120} and every [formula] there exists an r∈Ra such that ak + r is not of the form [formula], and thus every natural number can be written as the sum of three terms of the sequence [formula].

To demonstrate this, we show the case a = 7. All the other cases are done in exactly the same way.

For [formula] (mod 8) we have [formula] (mod 8), respectively, and for [formula] (mod 8) we have [formula] (mod 8), respectively. Since [formula] (mod 8), [formula], we conclude that for every [formula] we can write 7k + r, for r∈R7  =  {4,6}, such that it is not of the form [formula]. The case now follows from Theorem [\ref=hovedresultat].

Further, one should note that the set of integers satisfying Conjecture [\ref=main] is closed under multiplication by a square.

Let M be the set of integers satisfying Conjecture [\ref=main]. If a∈M, then ak2∈M for any integer k > 0.

This follows easily since for any n we can find [formula] such that

[formula]

Knowing this, we see that since Conjecture [\ref=main] is satisfied for a = 3,9,4, and 8, it must also hold for a = 3k for any positive integer k and for a = 2k,k > 1.

Finally, using Observation [\ref=oplagt], Corollary [\ref=vals], and the fact [\cite=analyt] that Conjecture [\ref=main] holds for a = 3, we get that the conjecture holds for the following values up to 120.

[formula]

Unfortunately, it seems that the method deployed in Theorem [\ref=hovedresultat] is not extendable to other cases, since its success relies on Ra, and in general Ra does not contain the necessary elements for the condition in the theorem to be satisfied.
