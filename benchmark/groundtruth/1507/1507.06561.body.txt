Classification of trisections and the Generalized Property R Conjecture

Introduction

A trisection is a decomposition of a four-manifold into three standard pieces. The theory of trisections, due to Gay and Kirby [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections], provides a four-dimensional analogue to the theory of Heegaard splittings for three-manifolds and promises a new bridge between well-established techniques and results from three-manifold theory and the less well-understood realm of four-manifolds.

Recall that an n-dimensional 1-handlebody of genus g is a space diffeomorphic to [formula]. The following definition of a trisection is slightly more general than the original one appearing in [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections].

Let X be a closed, connected, orientable, smooth four-manifold. A (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection of X is a quadruple (Σ,X1,X2,X3) satisfying the following conditions:

[formula];

Xi is four-dimensional 1-handlebody of genus ki for i∈{1,2,3};

[formula] is a three-dimensional handlebody of genus g for i  ≠  j; and

[formula] is a closed, orientable surface of genus g.

The genus of the trisection is the genus g of Σ.

The original definition in [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections] requires that k1 = k2 = k3; here, we will relax this condition. If k1 = k2 = k3, we call the trisection balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

The simplest example of a trisection is the genus zero trisection of S4, which is a decomposition of S4 into three four-balls which are glued pairwise along three-ball halves of their boundaries. This is the unique trisection of genus zero, and there are precisely three balanced trisections of genus one. These trisections correspond to the manifolds [formula], [formula], and S1  ×  S3, and their diagrams are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:GenusOneBal] below. However, as we will see, there are three more unbalanced trisection of genus one, which correspond to the three stabilizations of the genus zero trisection of S4.

In addition to deducing an existence result for trisections, Gay and Kirby define a stabilization operation and prove that any two trisections of a fixed four-manifold have a common stabilization. Their stabilization operation is effectively the combination of three smaller stabilization operations, arranged to preserve balance. Since we are interested in unbalanced trisections, we will restrict our attention to the three component operations instead of the balanced operation. (See Section 3.)

The main result of this paper is that a large class of unbalanced trisections is trivial in the sense that each member can be expressed as the connected sum of (unbalanced) genus one trisections. In particular, they are stabilizations of connected sums of balanced genus one trisections.

Suppose that X admits a (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection T with k1  ≥  g - 1, and let k'  =   max {k2,k3}. Then, X is diffeomorphic either to #  k'(S1  ×  S3) or to the connected sum of #  k'S1  ×  S3 with one of [formula] or [formula], and T is the connected sum of genus one trisections.

The proof makes essential use of "Heegaard-Kirby diagrams", which we introduce in Section [\ref=sec:Heeg-Kirb], and which let us pass easily between handle decompositions and trisections of four-manifolds. In particular, they allow us to utilize deep classification results for Dehn surgeries between connected sums of S1  ×  S2 (drawing on multiple works [\cite=gabai:II] [\cite=gordon:combinatorial] [\cite=scharlemann:reducible]) in order to prove the trisection classification result Theorem [\ref=thm:class]. We then use Heegaard-Kirby diagrams to go back in the opposite direction, leveraging Theorem [\ref=thm:class] to prove the following Dehn surgery result.

Suppose that L is a c-component link in #  k(S1  ×  S2) with an integral framed surgery to #  c + k(S1  ×  S2).

If L has tunnel number c + k - 1, then L is a c-component 0-framed unlink.

If L has tunnel number c + k, then there is a sequence of handleslides taking the split union of L with a (k + 1)-component 0-framed unlink to a (c + k + 1)-component 0-framed unlink.

As a special case of this corollary, we see that c-component links with tunnel number c - 1 satisfy the Generalized Property R Conjecture, while c-component links with tunnel number c satisfy a slight weakening of this conjecture. We discuss the connection between trisections and the Generalized Property R Conjecture in Section [\ref=sec:propR], where we introduce a family of trisections of S4 that seem highly likely to be non-standard.

Conventions

Unless otherwise mentioned, we work in the smooth category throughout. A manifold Y is said to be properly embedded in X if it is transverse to ∂X and [formula]. A proper isotopy of Y in X is a homotopy of Y in X through proper embeddings. Let N(Y,X) denote a closed regular neighborhood of Y in X, and let [formula] be the exterior of Y in X. We shall often drop the ambient space X from this notation when no confusion can arise.

Heegaard splittings

In this section, we formally introduce Heegaard splittings of compact, orientable three-manifolds. We recommend [\cite=scharlemann:handbook] for a more detailed introduction.

A Heegaard splitting of a closed, orientable three-manifold Y is a decomposition of Y into a pair of three-dimensional handlebodies. This definition can be generalized to compact Y by using compression bodies.

Let Σ be a closed surface. A compression body is a compact three-manifold H constructed from Σ  ×  I by attaching 2-handles to Σ  ×  {0} and capping off any resulting 2-sphere boundary components with 3-balls. We define ∂+H  =  Σ  ×  {1} and [formula].

Let Y be a compact, connected, orientable three-manifold. A genus g Heegaard splitting of Y is a triple (Σ,H1,H2) satisfying the following conditions:

[formula];

Hi is a compression body for i = 1,2; and

[formula] is a closed, orientable surface of genus g.

The surface Σ is said to be a Heegaard surface for Y.

Notice our definition forces [formula]. In the case that Y is closed, this agrees with the above definition in which H1 and H2 are handlebodies. The following result is well-known.

Every compact, orientable, connected three-manifold admits a Heegaard splitting.

One way to describe a Heegaard splitting of a closed three-manifold is by means of a Heegaard diagram, which is defined using compressing disks in each of the handlebodies in the splitting.

Suppose H is a genus g handlebody and [formula] is a disjoint union of properly embedded disks in H. The collection D is said to be complete if E(D,H) is homeomorphic to a ball. In this case, the curves ∂D in ∂H are said to be a defining set of curves for H.

A Heegaard diagram of a Heegaard splitting (Σ,Hα,Hβ) is a triple (Σ,α,β), where α is a defining set of curves for Hα in Σ and β is a defining set of curves for Hβ in Σ.

Although every Heegaard diagram determines a single Heegaard splitting, every Heegaard splitting admits infinitely many distinct Heegaard diagrams. The simplest Heegaard diagrams and their corresponding splittings arise frequently in this paper.

A Heegaard diagram (Σ,α,β) in a genus g surface Σ is said to be (g,k)-standard if the α and β curves can be indexed so that

αi  =  βi for all i  ≤  k.

[formula] for all i > k.

A Heegaard diagram is called standard if it is (g,k)-standard for some 0  ≤  k  ≤  g.

A (g,k)-standard Heegaard diagram defines a genus g Heegaard splitting of #  k(S1  ×  S2) for all g  ≥  k  ≥  0 (throughout, we define #  0(S1  ×  S2) = S3). In fact this is the unique genus g splitting of #  k(S1  ×  S2) up to isotopy according to the following classical result of Waldhausen.

[\cite=waldhausen] Suppose [formula]. Then for all g  ≥  k  ≥  0, there is a unique genus g Heegaard splitting of Y up to isotopy.

The connected sum operation extends naturally to Heegaard splittings. Let H' and H'' be Heegaard splittings for three-manifolds Y' and Y'' given by (Σ',Hα',Hβ') and (Σ'',Hα'',Hβ''), respectively. Then there is a natural Heegaard splitting H for Y'  #  Y'' given by (Σ,Hα,Hβ) where

[formula]

Let δ denote the curve on Σ that determines the decomposition Σ  =  Σ'  #  Σ''. This curve has the property that it bounds disks Dα and Dβ in Hα and Hβ, respectively.

A Heegaard splitting H given by (Σ,Hα,Hβ) is reducible if there exists a curve δ on Σ that bounds disks Dα and Dβ in Hα and Hβ, respectively.

The curve δ is called a reducing curve. The following classical result is due to Haken.

[\cite=haken] Suppose Y is a reducible three-manifold with Heegaard surface Σ. Then there is a reducing sphere S for Y that meets Σ in a single reducing curve.

Consequently, every Heegaard splitting of a reducible three-manifold is reducible. The final operation on Heegaard splittings that we will need to understand is stabilization.

Let H = (Σ,Hα,Hβ) be a Heegaard splitting of M and let ω be a boundary parallel arc properly embedded in Hβ. Then if [formula], Hβ' = E(ω,Hβ) and [formula], the triple H' = (Σ',Hα',Hβ') is also a Heegaard splitting of Y, called the stabilization of H. Conversely, we say that H is a destabilization of H'.

Alternatively, the stabilization of a Heegaard splitting H is just H  #  S, where S is the genus one Heegaard splitting of S3. Hence, if both (Σ',Hα',Hβ') and (Σ'',Hα'',Hβ'') are stabilizations of the same Heegaard splitting of Y, then there is an isotopy of Y taking Σ' to Σ'' and Hα' to Hα''. In other words, the Heegaard splittings are isotopic. On the other hand, destabilizations do not always exist, and when they do they are not always unique up to isotopy.

As an example, when g > k, the (g,k)-standard Heegaard splitting is stabilized, so it follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:waldhausen] that every genus g Heegaard splitting of #  k(S1  ×  S2) with g > k is stabilized.

Two Heegaard splittings H1 and H2 for Y are called stably isotopic if there exist integers m1 and m2 such that the Heegaard splittings H1' and H2' obtained by stabilizing H1 and H2 m1 times and m2 times, respectively, are isotopic. The following is a classical result of Reidemeister and Singer.

[\cite=reidemeister] [\cite=singer] Any two Heegaard splittings for a fixed three-manifold are stably isotopic.

Trisections

In this section we describe how analogues of the concepts introduced in the previous section naturally arise in the theory of trisections as well. Gay and Kirby proved the following existence result for trisections.

[\cite=gay-kirby:trisections] Every closed, orientable, connected, smooth four-manifold admits a balanced trisection.

Given a trisection (Σ,X1,X2,X3) of X as in Definition [\ref=def:tri], let [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We call the union of the handlebodies [formula] the spine of the trisection. Note that each pair of three-dimensional handlebodies in the spine of a trisection forms a Heegaard splitting of the boundary of the four-dimensional 1-handlebody on which they lie. For example, (Σ,Hα,Hβ) is a Heegaard splitting of [formula].

On the other hand, one may thicken the spine [formula] to obtain a four-manifold with three boundary components, each of which is homeomorphic to some #  ki(S1  ×  S2). By [\cite=laudenbach-poenaru], there is a unique way to cap off each of these boundary components with a four-dimensional handlebody. It follows that every trisection is determined up to diffeomorphism by its spine, which in turn is determined by a diagram of curves in Σ.

Let X be a four-manifold with trisection T with spine [formula]. A trisection diagram for T is a quadruple (Σ,α,β,γ) where α, β, and γ are defining sets of curves in Σ for Hα, Hβ, and Hγ, respectively.

As with Heegaard splittings, a given trisection admits many distinct trisection diagrams, although each diagram determines a single trisection. Using diagrams, we can readily define the class of standard trisections.

A trisection diagram (Σ,α,β,γ) is called standard if each of the Heegaard diagrams (Σ,α,β), (Σ,α,γ) and (Σ,β,γ) is standard. A trisection is called standard if it has a standard diagram.

It is easy to see that all six of the genus one trisections are standard. The three possibilities in the balanced case are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:GenusOneBal], and correspond to [formula], [formula], and S1  ×  S3. The three unbalanced genus one trisections of S4 are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:GenusOneStab] and correspond to the three stabilization operations (see below). In [\cite=mz:genus2], the authors show that all balanced genus two trisections are standard. The main theorem of the present work states that every (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection with k1 = g or g - 1 is standard. In particular, this proves that unbalanced genus two trisections are standard as well. Note that any trisection obtained by taking a connected sum of genus one trisections is standard.

We call a four-manifold X reducible if X = X1  #  X2 such that neither Xi is diffeomorphic to S4. As with Heegaard splittings, there is a natural extension of the connected sum operation to trisections given by the formula

[formula]

There is a notion of reducibility for trisections, as well.

A trisection T with spine [formula] is reducible if there exists a curve δ  ⊂  Σ such that δ bounds disks Dα, Dβ, and Dγ in Hα, Hβ, and Hγ, respectively. The curve δ is called a reducing curve.

An embedded three-sphere S in a trisected manifold [formula] is said to be trisected reducing sphere if [formula] is a three-ball for each i and [formula] is an essential closed curve.

A trisection T is reducible if and only if T admits a trisected reducing sphere.

Suppose T is reducible. Let R1  ⊂  ∂X1 denote the two-sphere [formula], and note that X1 has a handle decomposition consisting only of a single 0-handle and k1 1-handles. It is possible that the belt spheres of the 1-handles intersect R1 initially, but by [\cite=laudenbach:spheres], we can isotope and handle slide the 1-handles over one another until their belt spheres are disjoint from R1. It follows that R1 can be assumed to lie in the boundary of the 0-handle such that it is disjoint form the attaching regions of the 1-handles. Since this boundary is diffeomorphic to S3, it follows that R1 bounds a three-ball B1 in X1.

A similar argument produces three-balls B2 and B3 bounded by [formula] and [formula], respectively. The union of these three-balls along their pairwise intersections gives the desired three-sphere S. The converse is clear, since [formula] is a reducing curve.

This leads us to the following question, which is the four-dimensional analogue of Haken's Lemma (Theorem [\ref=thm:haken]).

Is every trisection of a reducible four-manifold reducible?

If the answer is "yes", it would imply that the maximum number of summands that can occur in a connected sum decomposition of a closed orientable smooth four-manifold X is bounded from above by the minimum genus of a trisection of X. In particular, it would imply the smooth Schönflies conjecture.

Finally, we define the process of stabilization.

Let T = (Σ,X1,X2,X3) be a trisection for X, and let ω be a properly embedded, boundary parallel arc in [formula]. A i-stabilization of T is a trisection T' = (Σ',X1',X2',X3'), where [formula], Xj' = E(ω,Xj) for [formula], and [formula]. Conversely, T is said to be an i-destabilization of T'.

If T is a (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection, then the 1-stabilization of T is a (g + 1;k1 + 1,k2,k3) trisection (and similarly for i = 2,3). Definition [\ref=def:heegstab] for Heegaard splittings is similar; however, the construction is symmetric - it does not matter whether the arc ω is properly embedded in H1 or H2, as the resulting Heegaard splittings are isotopic. For trisections, the result of an i-stabilization is generally not isotopic to the result of a j-stabilization when j  ≠  i. However, any two i-stabilizations of a trisection are isotopic. Moreover, i-stabilizations and j-stabilizations commute; the result of performing an i-stabilization followed by a j-stabilization is isotopic to the result of performing a j-stabilization followed by an i-stabilization.

We note that our definition of stabilization differs slightly from the one appearing in [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections]; Gay and Kirby define stabilization to be the result of a 1-, 2-, and 3-stabilization in order to preserve the balance of a trisection.

Just as with Heegaard splittings, there is an alternative to Definition [\ref=def:tristab] that uses the connected sum operation on trisections. Recall the three unbalanced genus one trisections of S4 whose diagrams are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:GenusOneStab].

Let T be a trisection for X. Then, for any unbalanced genus one trisection S of S4, T' = T  #  S is also a trisection for X and is called a stabilization of T. Any trisection T that can be written as T' = T  #  S is called stabilized.

As with reducibility, there is a diagrammatic criterion which allows us to deduce that a trisection is stabilized.

Suppose T is a trisection with spine [formula], and suppose there is a pair of curves ω,γ properly embedded in Σ with the following properties.

ω bounds a disk in Hα and Hβ;

γ bounds a disk in Hγ; and,

[formula].

Then T is 1-stabilized. The obvious analogues hold for i = 2,3 as well.

This is clear when the genus of T is one. When the genus is greater than one, [formula] is an essential curve which bounds disks in each of Hα,Hβ, and Hγ. By Proposition [\ref=prop:red_diag], δ is a reducing curve on Σ that decomposes T into two trisections, one of which is the genus one trisection of S4 corresponding to 1-stabilization.

Gay and Kirby show that the analogue of the classical Reidemeister-Singer Theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:reid_sing]) holds for trisections as well.

[\cite=gay-kirby:trisections] Any two trisections of a smooth four-manifold X are stably isotopic.

Aside from Theorem [\ref=thm:tristab], we know almost nothing about the set of trisections associated with a smooth manifold X. Even the case of S4 (equipped with its standard smooth structure) is not well-understood, although it clearly admits a family of standard trisection obtained via stabilization. Let S0 denote the standard (0,0)-trisection of S4, and let Sk1,k2,k3 denote the trisection obtained by performing ki i-stabilizations of S0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  3. Each of these trisections is unique up to isotopy. Despite the fact that it is likely false (see Section [\ref=sec:propR]), we boldly make the following conjecture as a four-dimensional analogue to Waldhausen's Theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:waldhausen]) for S4.

Every trisection T of S4 is isotopic to S0 or one of its stabilizations Sk1,k2,k3.

In other words, we posit that every positive genus trisection of S4 stabilized. Theorem [\ref=thm:class] proves Conjecture [\ref=ques:wald] for the case of (g;g - 1,1,0)-trisections.

Let X be a four-manifold that admits a (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection. The induced handle decomposition (described in Section [\ref=sec:Heeg-Kirb]) yields χ(X) = k1 + k2 + k3 - g + 2. It follows that any trisection of S4 must satisfy g = k1 + k2 + k3. Moreover, if ki = 0 for any i, then [formula]. (The next section shows how such a trisection induces a handle decomposition of X with no 1-handles.) By work of Freedman, if χ(X) = 2 and [formula], then X is homeomorphic to S4 [\cite=freedman] [\cite=freedman-quinn].

Heegaard-Kirby diagrams

In this section, we discuss how to pass between handle decompositions and trisections of four-manifolds using Heegaard-Kirby diagrams.

Suppose L is a c-component integer-framed link in #  n(S1  ×  S2) such that Dehn surgery along the framing of L yields #  m(S1  ×  S2). Suppose (Σ,H1,H2) is a genus g Heegaard splitting of E(L,  #  n(S1  ×  S2)) such that H1 is a handlebody. Then the pair L = (L,Σ) is said to be a (g;n,c,m)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram.

We will regard two Heegaard-Kirby diagrams in #  n(S1  ×  S2) as equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism of #  n(S1  ×  S2) which preserves the corresponding links (with framings) and Heegaard surfaces. The framed link L of a (g;n,c,m)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram determines a handle decomposition of a closed four-manifold X which consists of a single 0-handle, n 1-handles, c 2-handles, m 3-handles, and a single 4-handle. The Heegaard splitting (Σ,H1,H2) of Definition [\ref=def:Heeg-Kirb] then determines a way to carve out a trisection from this handle decomposition. The proof of the following proposition is contained in Lemma 14 of [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections], which uses different terminology.

Every (g;n,c,m)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram L corresponding to a four-manifold X determines a unique (g;n,g - c,m)-trisection T(L) of X up to diffeomorphism.

Let L = (L,Σ) be a (g;n,c,m)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram for X, and let [formula] denote the result of the integral surgery on [formula] along L. Let X1 and X3 denote the unions of the 0-handle and the 1-handles and the 3-handles and the 4-handles, respectively. Then, ∂X1  =  Y, and ∂X3  =  Y'.

Now, let (Σ,Hα,Hβ) be the genus g Heegaard splitting of Y induced by Σ, and suppose that (Σ,Hα,E(L,Hβ)) is the corresponding Heegaard splitting of E(L,Y). The result of surgering Hβ along L is a new handlebody, which we denote Hγ. Let X2 be the trace of this surgery. In other words, X2 is the result of attaching c 2-handles to Hβ  ×  [0,1] along L  ×  {1}. It follows that [formula], since [formula] and since the 2-handles attached along L are dual to c of the 1-handles in [formula].

Thus, X1, X2, and X3 are all four-dimensional 1-handlebodies of genus n, g - c, and m, respectively. By construction, [formula], [formula], and [formula] are all three-dimensional handlebodies of genus g whose common boundary is Σ. Therefore, T(L) = (Σ,X1,X2,X3) is a (g;n,g - c,m)-trisection of X.

In [\cite=gay-kirby:trisections], Gay and Kirby use Proposition [\ref=thm:HeegKirb1] to give one proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:triext].

The roles played by Hα, Hβ, and Hγ can be interchanged due to the inherent symmetry of trisections. We use this fact to prove the main theorem, and this symmetry is a major strength of viewing four-manifolds through the lens of trisections. For the sake of consistency, however, we will stick with the chosen designations throughout.

Now, every curve on Σ which bounds a disk in H2  =  E(L,Hβ) bounds a disk in both Hβ and Hγ. This observation, in conjunction with Propositions [\ref=prop:red_diag] and [\ref=prop:stab_diag], allows us to immediately deduce the following easy but powerful lemma.

Let L = (L,Σ) be a Heegaard-Kirby diagram for X. Let H = (Σ,H1,H2) be a Heegaard splitting of E(L), and suppose that L induces a trisection T(L) of X.

If H is reducible, then T is reducible.

If H is stabilized, then T is 2-stabilized.

On the other hand, given a trisection T = (Σ,X1,X2,X3) of X, we can find many Heegaard-Kirby diagrams (L,Σ) which induce T. As we will see, each such diagram arises from a special choice of disks in Hβ, which amounts to changing our framed link description of X.

Let (Σ,H,H') be a genus g Heegaard splitting for a three-manifold Y. A disk D properly embedded in H is primitive in H with respect to H' if there is a disk D' properly embedded in H' such that [formula]. If [formula], then a complete collection of primitive disks for H is any disjoint union [formula] of nonisotopic disks which are primitive in H with respect to H'.

Note that Theorem [\ref=thm:waldhausen] implies that for every Heegaard splitting (Σ,H,H') for #  k(S1  ×  S2), there is a complete collection of primitive disks for H.

Just as a Heegaard splitting has many Heegaard diagrams, a trisection has many Heegaard-Kirby diagrams. Given a (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection (Σ,X1,X2,X3) of X with spine [formula], let [formula] be the boundary of a complete collection of primitive disks for Hγ with respect to Hβ. Then after pushing L into Hβ and giving it the surface framing induced by Σ, we obtain a (g;k1,g - k2,k3)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram L(D) = (L,Σ), where (Hα,E(L,Hβ),Σ) is a Heegaard splitting of E(L,∂X1). A key fact to observe is that the primitivity of L with respect to Hβ ensures that E(L,Hβ) will be a compression body. This gives the following lemma.

For any (g;k1,k2,k3)-trisection T = (Σ,X1,X2,X3) of X and complete collection D of disks in Hγ that are primitive with respect to Hβ, we have T(L(D)) = T, where T(L(D)) is the trisection induced by the Heegaard-Kirby diagram L(D).

Proof of the main theorem

An important ingredient in the proof of the main theorem is the following classification of Dehn surgeries between connected sums of S1  ×  S2. This result is implicit in the more general Theorem 6.9 of [\cite=gordon:combinatorial], where the pertinent case is attributed to [\cite=gabai:II] and [\cite=scharlemann:reducible]. We sketch a proof for convenience.

Suppose that K is a knot in #  k(S1  ×  S2) and that K admits a non-trivial Dehn surgery to #  k'(S1  ×  S2), where k'  ≥  k. Then k'∈{k,k + 1}, K is unknotted and contained in a ball, and the surgery slope is [formula] for [formula] or zero, respectively.

Note that the theorem implies that if K is a knot in #  k(S1  ×  S2) with a surgery to #  k'(S1  ×  S2), then k'∈{k - 1,k,k + 1}, since the case k' < k is just the dual surgery picture to the case k < k'. It follows that the above theorem completely classifies such surgeries.

Knots in #  k(S1  ×  S2) are determined by their complements [\cite=gabai:II], so the result follows in the case that surgery on K yields #  k(S1  ×  S2).

Suppose instead that K has a surgery to #  k'(S1  ×  S2), where k'  >  k. Since K is a knot, surgery on K can increase the rank of the first homology by at most one, and thus k'  =  k + 1. We proceed by induction. The case when k = 0 is the Property R Conjecture, which was settled by Gabai [\cite=gabai:III]. Assume that the theorem is true for any k < n, and suppose that K is a knot in #  n(S1  ×  S2) with a surgery to #  n + 1(S1  ×  S2). Because the rank of the first homology is increasing from n to n + 1, K must be null-homologous.

Suppose that E(K) contains a reducing sphere P. Then, by surgering P, we reduce the set-up to a surgery on K in #  n - 1(S1  ×  S2), so we are done by our inductive hypothesis. If E(K) is ∂-reducible, the E(K) is reducible; surgering ∂E(K) along the reducing disk gives an essential sphere in E(K).

It follows that E(K) is irreducible and ∂-irreducible. But now we satisfy the hypotheses of the main result of [\cite=scharlemann:reducible], which tells us that n = 0, completing the proof.

We are now prepared to prove our main result.

The case k1 = g is trivial, since it implies X has a handle decomposition without 2-handles and must be the connected sum of k2  =  k3 copies of S1  ×  S3.

For the case k1 = g - 1, we proceed by induction on g. If g = 1, the statement follows from the classification of genus one trisections. Suppose that the theorem holds whenever g' < g. It suffices to show that T is reducible, because this implies that T can be written as a connected sum of a (g';k1',k2',k3')-trisection T' and a (g'';k1'',k2'',k3'')-trisection T'', where g  =  g'  +  g'' and g - 1  =  k1  =  k1'  +  k1''. By the inductive hypothesis, both T' and T'' satisfy the conclusions of the theorem.

To match the conventions in Section [\ref=sec:Heeg-Kirb], regard T as a (g;k2,g - 1,k3)-trisection from now on. Given such a trisection, a complete collection of primitive disks for Hγ with respect to Hβ will consist of a single disk, and will thus induce a Heegaard-Kirby diagram (L,Σ) in #  k2(S1  ×  S2) in which L has a single component. If necessary, permute X2 and X3 so that k3  ≥  k2. By Theorem [\ref=thm:Dehn], the knot L is an unknot in #  k2(S1  ×  S2) and k3∈{k2,k2 + 1}.

Therefore, we have [formula], where V denotes the solid torus. Hence, if k2 > 0, then E(L,  #  k2(S1  ×  S2)) is reducible. In the case k2 = 0, E(L) is a solid torus. It is a standard theorem (see [\cite=lei:stability] for a reference) that any genus g  ≥  2 Heegaard splitting of the solid torus is reducible (in fact stabilized). In any case, the splitting of E(L) is reducible, and thus by Lemmas [\ref=lem:Heeg-Kirb] and [\ref=lem:Heeg-Kirb2], the trisection T is reducible as well.

Notice that if T is a (g;g,k2,k3)-trisection, then k2  =  k3. Similarly, if T is a (g;g - 1,k2,k3)-trisection, then we have that k3∈{k2 - 1,k2,k2 + 1}. In addition, if a manifold X with a (g;g - 1,k2,k3)-trisection T has a [formula] or [formula] summand, then T may be expressed as the connected sum of the standard (1;0,0,0)-trisection and a (g - 1;g - 1,k2,k3)-trisection; thus, T must have parameters (g;g - 1,k3,k3).

Applications to the Generalized Property R Conjecture

In this section, we prove Corollary [\ref=coro:links], and we discuss the applications of our results to the Generalized Property R Conjecture and related problems, including the search for non-standard trisections of S4.

Let L be a c-component link in a closed three-manifold Y. A tunnel system τ for L is a collection of arcs [formula] that are embedded in Y such that [formula] for all i. A tunnel system is called complete if [formula] is a handlebody. The minimum number of arcs in a complete tunnel system for L is called the tunnel number of L, and is denoted τ(L). Note that L admits a complete tunnel system with n tunnels if and only if E(L) has a Heegaard splitting (Σ,H1,H2) of genus n + 1 such that H1 is a handlebody.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:class] above relies heavily on the Dehn surgery classification given by Theorem [\ref=thm:Dehn]. Using the symmetry inherent to trisections, we may now take Theorem [\ref=thm:class] and extract a new surgery result, stated in the following corollary.

We may assume that c  ≥  2, since the case c = 1 is covered by Theorem [\ref=thm:Dehn]. Let [formula] be a complete tunnel system for L, and let X be the four-manifold constructed by capping off the boundary components of the trace of the surgery on L with four-dimensional 1-handlebodies. First, if n  =  c + k - 1, then E(L,  #  k(S1  ×  S2)) has a genus c + k Heegaard splitting Σ, and (Σ,L) is a (c + k;k,c,c + k)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram for X inducing a (c + k;k,k,c + k)-trisection T. By the correspondence in Section [\ref=sec:Heeg-Kirb], we know that L lies on the trisection surface Σ and bounds disks in Hγ. However, since [formula] is a genus (c + k) Heegaard splitting for #  c + k(S1  ×  S2), every curve bounding a disk in Hγ also bounds a disk in Hα. We conclude that L is a c-component unlink in [formula].

If n  =  c + k, then there is a (c + k + 1;k,c,c + k)-Heegaard-Kirby diagram (Σ,L) for X which yields a (c + k + 1;k,k + 1,c + k)-trisection T. By Theorem [\ref=thm:class], the trisection T may be written as a connected sum of genus one trisections, and by Remark [\ref=rmk:parameters], X does not have a [formula] or [formula] summand. It follows that each summand of T is a genus one diagram for S4 or S1  ×  S3, and T has a diagram (Σ,α',β',γ') such that each curve in γ' bounds a disk in at least one of Hα or Hβ. This implies that γ' is a (c + k + 1)-component 0-framed unlink in [formula]. Let Dγ' denote the collection of disks in Hγ bounded by γ'.

As above, the link L bounds a complete collection D of primitive disks in Hγ with respect to Hβ. Since D is primitive with respect to Hβ and (Σ,Hβ,Hγ) is a Heegaard splitting of #  k + 1(S1  ×  S2), we can extend D to a complete collection [formula] of disks for Hγ such that the k + 1 curves U  =  ∂D* bound disks in both Hβ and Hγ. It follows that U is a (k + 1)-component 0-framed unlink. Finally, by [\cite=johannson], the collections [formula] and Dγ' of disks are related by a sequence of handleslides, and thus their boundaries, [formula] and γ', are similarly related.

We note that in the case that k = 0 and c = 2, conclusion (1) above has been established in [\cite=gst] with a proof attributed to Alan Reid. This proof can be extended to show (1) holds for k = 0 and for any value of c. The restriction to links in S3 is of special importance, because it relates to the Generalized Property R Conjecture (GPRC). For an overview of recent developments in the GPRC, see [\cite=gst] and [\cite=williams:GPR]. The strongest statement of the conjecture is likely false.

The authors of [\cite=gst] also present a weaker version of the conjecture.

We propose a third, related conjecture to serve as an intermediary between the GPRC and the Weak GPRC. This new conjecture is more closely related to Corollary [\ref=coro:links] and to trisections than the two conjectures appearing in [\cite=gst].

Observe that Corollary [\ref=coro:links] implies that c-component links with tunnel number at most c satisfy the Stable GPRC. Clearly, the GPRC implies the Stable GPRC, and the Stable GPRC implies the Weak GRPC. In [\cite=gst], the GPRC for two-component links is discussed in detail, and an infinite family {Ln,1} of likely counterexamples is given, along with an interesting relationship between the GPRC and the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture. Roughly, the latter conjecture states that every balanced presentation of the trivial group can be changed to a trivial presentation via Andrews-Curtis moves, which include the inversion of a relator, replacing a relator with a product of two relators, and conjugating a relator by a generator. If a presentation P of the trivial group can be transformed to the trivial presentation in this way, then P is Andrew-Curtis trivial. See [\cite=andrews-curtis] for more details.

In [\cite=gst], the authors establish the following theorem.

[\cite=gst] If Ln,1 satisfies the Generalized Property R Conjecture, then the following presentation of the trivial group is Andrews-Curtis trivial:

[formula]

For n  ≥  3, the presentations Pn are believed to be Andrews-Curtis nontrivial. Although they conclude that the GPRC is likely false, the authors of [\cite=gst] show that the links {Ln,1} still satisfy the Weak GPRC. Thus, the following question is of interest.

Do the links {Ln,1} satisfy the Stable Generalized Property R Conjecture?

There is a well-known weakening of the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture, called the Stable Andrews-Curtis Conjecture, which asserts that any balanced presentation of the trivial group may be reduced to the trivial presentation with Andrews-Curtis moves and a stabilization/destabilization move in which a trivial generator-relator pair is either added or deleted. Although the stable version is typically distinguished from the original conjecture in group theory literature, the distinction is often blurred among topologists (see, for example, [\cite=gompf-stipsicz]). It is unknown whether the above presentations Pn are stably Andrews-Curtis trivial.

Let L be a link, and let (Σ,L) be a Heegaard-Kirby diagram which gives rise to a trisection T, with components labeled as above. We leave it to the reader to verify that stabilizing Σ and adding a distant 0-framed unknot to L can be arranged to correspond to 3-stabilizing the trisection T, stabilizing Σ without modifying L corresponds to 2-stabilizing T (Lemma [\ref=lem:Heeg-Kirb]), and adding a canceling Hopf pair may be arranged to correspond to 1-stabilizing T.

For some n  ≥  3, consider Ln,1, one of the proposed counterexamples, and let Σ be a Heegaard surface for E(Ln,1). Let Tn denote the trisection induced by (Ln,1,Σ). In [\cite=gst], the authors show that the link L'n,1 consisting of Ln,1 and a single Hopf pair is handleslide equivalent to a 0-framed unlink and a single Hopf pair, and the four-manifold X described by the surgery is a standard S4. This fact does not immediately imply that a 1-stabilization of Tn is trivial (since handleslides may not take place in the surface Σ), but it is reasonable to believe that applying a 1-stabilization to Tn and then stabilizing a relatively small number (possibly zero) of additional times will give one of the standard trisections of S4.

On the other hand, if Tn itself is standard, then it follows that there is an r-component 0-framed unlink Ur such that [formula] is handle slide equivalent to a (2 + r)-component unlink, so the links Ln,1 have the Stable Generalized Property R. We conclude with the following.

If the trisection Tn is standard, then the presentation Pn is stably Andrews-Curtis trivial. More generally, if every trisection of the smooth four-sphere is standard, then the presentations Pn are stably Andrews-Curtis trivial.

Note that, as mentioned above, only 1-stabilization results in the introduction of a Hopf pair to the surgery description. It follows performing 2- or 3-stabilizations on Tn will not change the conclusion of the above proposition. In particular, any choice of Heegaard surface Σ for E(L) is allowed.

Therefore, if Question [\ref=stableln] has a negative answer, then not only are the trisections Tn non-standard splittings of S4, but it would also follow that any trisection in an infinite sequence of 2- and 3-stabilizations performed on Tn is also non-standard! We consider this possibility to be both striking and probable.
