Limits on Planet Formation Around Young Pulsars and Implications for Supernova Fallback Disks

Introduction

Somewhat surprisingly, the first extra-solar planets were detected in orbit around the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+ 12 [\citep=Wolszczan90]. Since then, optical observers have honed their techniques to the point where thousands of planets have now been detected around virtually all stellar classes [\citep=Wright11] [\citep=Rowe14]. Meanwhile, in spite of potentially high sensitivity to low-mass planets [\citep=Thorsett92] [\citep=Cordes93], the radio pulsar community has turned up only one further case, a super-Jupiter in a triple system within a globular cluster [\citep=Sigurdsson03].

Why is this so? First, a Galactic field pulsar planet must either have survived a supernova or have formed from the debris of the explosion. [\citet=Phinney93] give a delightful review of these "Salamander" and "Memnonides" scenarios, of which we consider planet formation in a supernova fallback disk [\citep=Lin91] the most relevant mechanism. Here, reverse shock waves generated at density transitions in the stellar core and envelope decelerate material that falls back toward the compact remnant [\citep=Chevalier89]. The total mass, accretion rate, and intrinsic angular momentum depend sensitively on both the initial stellar conditions and mixing during the explosion, but ultimately ~   0.1 M[formula] of material may circularize into a relatively long-lived "debris" disk [\citep=Menou01]. [\citet=Wang06] observed a distinct infrared component from the anomalous X-ray pulsar 4U 0141+  61, consistent with the reprocessing of X-ray emission by a warm disk, but other direct disk searches have failed to locate further examples [\citep=Wang14].

Secondly, pulsars are far from perfect clocks. A companion induces a neutron star reflex motion detectable as a periodic delay in the pulse time-of-arrival (TOA). But pulsars suffer large amplitude, red timing noise [\citep=Shannon10] and glitches which can mask such periodic signals. In addition, correlations between pulse shape and timing residuals indicate quasi-periodic state switching [\citep=Lyne10] [\citep=Hobbs10b] with time-scales of months to years, mimicking the signature of planets. Finally, planets with very short or very long periods can evade detection due to finite observing cadences and data spans, respectively.

To further investigate the paucity of pulsar planets, we have searched for periodic signals in a sample of 151 energetic (spin-down luminosity [formula] erg s- 1) pulsars timed with the Parkes telescope in support of the Fermi mission. The [formula] and characteristic age τc of the sample are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:edots]. These young pulsars tend to glitch regularly and are also subject to strong timing noise, complicating the search for planets with periods much longer than a year. However, given the angular momentum budget (~  1049 erg s) of a fallback disk, any Earth-mass planets should reside within ~  2 AU of the neutron star, making our insensitivity to long periods unimportant for searching for planets formed in such disks. Moreover, the age range of our sample precisely spans the lifespan of an active disk and subsequent planet formation. Below, we present a new technique (§[\ref=sec:data]) for jointly modelling stochastic timing noise with other timing parameters which improves the robustness of detections of and upper limits on periodic signals. We derive upper limits (§[\ref=sec:ul]) for a range of periods for each member of our sample and present the combined constraints on the young pulsar population. We interpret the limits and their implications for supernova fallback debris disks in §[\ref=sec:discussion_disks] and we summarize our results in §[\ref=sec:summary].

Data Analysis

Our data comprise monthly timing observations with the Parkes telescope of 151 pulsars, largely identical to those given by [\citet=Weltevrede10]. The bulk of these observations are carried out with the 20 cm multi-beam receiver, with 256 MHz of bandwidth centred at 1369 MHz digitally polyphase filterbanked into 1024 channels and folded in real-time into 1024 phase bins. Observation lengths [formula] range from 2-20 minutes depending on the flux density and sharpness of the pulse profile. Data typically span the seven years from 2007 June to 2014 Oct, and within this interval we supplement our observations with archival data where available.

For each pulsar, we have determined the best timing model, typically comprising spin-down terms ν and [formula], the pulsar position, and, where required, proper motion and glitch parameters. A representative sample of the timing residuals to such a model (including a [formula] term) appears in Figure [\ref=fig:residuals]. The pulsars are strongly affected by red "spin" noise, and to estimate these parameters robustly requires modelling the resulting covariance between TOA measurements. We assume the red noise process is widesense stationary and model its power spectral density as

[formula]

Here, fc allows a possible low-frequency cutoff to the timing noise, while α describes its shape. By the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, P(f) is the Fourier transform of C(τ), the covariance between TOAs separated in time by an interval τ. To this C(τ) we add the white noise model, a diagonal covariance matrix comprising measurement uncertainty and "jitter" noise [\citep=Shannon14], which we model as [formula]. The complete covariance matrix C can be written as a Cholesky decomposition, C  =  LL*, with L a lower triangular matrix. If the noise model is accurate, L transforms the TOAs into unit variance normal random variables [\citep=Coles11]. The timing noise and jitter parameters, together with the pulsar timing parameters, form a complete model, and with the Cholesky decomposition we can efficiently evaluate its log likelihood. We apply Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods [\citep=Foreman-Mackey13] to determine its maximum and shape, yielding estimators for the parameters and their statistical uncertainty. We generally find this approach results in an acceptable fit, as evidenced by the successful whitening of the residuals, justifying our adoption of a power-law red noise model.

To characterize the reflex motion due to a single planet, we add to the above model the five Keplerian parameters (orbital period Pb, projected semi-major axis a, epoch of periastron T0, eccentricity e, and longitude of ascending node Ω) that fully define the orbit. We restrict the parameter space to 0 < e < 0.3 (with uniform prior) and [formula]. This is roughly the range of eccentricity expected from oligarchical planet formation scattering (see §[\ref=sec:discussion_disks]). The lower Pb bound is critically sampled with our monthly observing cadence, while the upper bound is roughly twice the data span. This is a substantial parameter space, and to ensure we explore it fully, we divide it into three subspaces: [formula], [formula], and [formula], a division motivated below. Following a lengthy burn-in period for the Markov chains to "forget" their initial conditions, we draw [formula] samples from the first subspace and [formula] samples from the latter two to form our final MCMC sample.

To search for planets, we computed the change in the log likelihood δ log L between the null (no planet) model and the best-fitting planet model over Pb bins. The value δ log L for a given planet mass depends strongly on the level of white and red noise, but with simulations we established [formula] as a reasonable universal threshold for a significant detection.

Restricting attention to candidates with Pb < 2 yr, we found significant modulation in five pulsars,with the timing residuals of one, PSR J1705-  3950, appearing in Figure [\ref=fig:residuals]. There are two strong arguments suggesting these are not pulsar planets. First, the implied masses are as great as 6 M[formula], and such objects would be easily detected, but have not been, in samples including older pulsars with little timing noise [\citep=Hobbs10b]. Second, three show evidence for a significant second harmonic, similar to the well-known state switching PSR B1828-  11 [\citep=Stairs00] [\citep=Lyne10], inviting a magnetospheric interpretation. If these harmonics are instead interpreted as two-planet systems, the resulting 2:1 mean motion resonance is dynamically unstable for the mass ratios [\citep=Beauge03]. We will present a detailed analysis and interpretation of these modulations in a future work, but emphasize here the key conclusion, that these modulations are unlikely to represent bona fide planets, and that the small number of candidates ensures that the upper limits we compute below remain valid.

Upper Limits on Planet Masses

The Keplerian parameter a is related to the companion mass by the mass function:

[formula]

where we have assumed mc  ≪  M*, with M* the neutron star mass. While masses of isolated neutron stars are generally unknown, measurements from unrecycled binary systems suggest the Chandrasekhar mass [formula] is representative [\citep=Lattimer12]. If the plane of the putative binary is randomly orientated, i.e. p(i) =  sin i, then the mean and median values of sin i are π / 4 = 0.785 and 0.866 respectively. We report projected mass values mc   sin i, so physical masses corresponding to our upper limits will typically be 15% greater.

Several examples of the resulting planet limits, as a function of Pb, are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:ul_examples]. As noted by [\citet=Thorsett92], the general features of these spectra reflect simple physics and the relative strength of the white and red noise. The high-frequency limit is set by white noise in the data, in turn set by the observing cadence and the TOA precision. In the absence of red noise, this limit scales as P- 2 / 3b following Equation [\ref=eq:kepler]. The sinusoid induced by planets with [formula] yr can be absorbed by shifting the apparent pulsar position, resulting in a dramatically reduced sensitivity. However, because we generalize our model to include 0 < e < 0.3, sensitivity at these time-scales is actually improved relative to the circular orbit case. Finally, the partial sinusoid of a long-period planet is similar to a parabola and is degenerate with ν, [formula], and the realization of timing noise, admitting large values of a. Our division into three subspaces reflects this behaviour.

Figure [\ref=fig:ul_examples] shows the range of typical cases. PSRs J1028-  5819 and J1614-  5048 are both affected by red noise and their sensitivity decreases monotonically with increasing Pb, but the low white noise level for J1028-  5819 allows good sensitivity to short-period objects like Mercury. PSR J1016-  5819 has a relatively high white noise level but very little red noise, and the favorable scaling of sensitivity with Pb yields good sensitivity to objects with Pb > 1 yr, like Mars. Finally, J1845-  0743 offers low noise at all frequencies and provides good sensitivity to every inner solar system analogue.

We can extract a posterior probability distribution for the entire population by assuming each pulsar is equally likely to host a planet. Then the posterior distribution of companion mass in a period bin is simply the sum of the individual distributions. Because we do in fact expect different pulsar ages to correspond to different stages of disk activity and planet formation, we have divided our sample into three bins of characteristic age (τc in Myr): τc > 0.3 (47 pulsars); 0.03 < τc  <  0.3 (84); and τc < 0.03 (20). Our primary result appears in Figure [\ref=fig:ul_population], where we have constructed posterior distributions for the first two τc bins. The curves show the companion mass below which the indicated fraction of the posterior distribution is contained. They can be interpreted as limits on the occurrence of planets of a given mass: there is only a 5% chance a planet as massive as those indicated by the uppermost curve could reside in our sample, etc. For completeness, we performed a similar analysis using a frequentist method (profile likelihood) but assuming circular orbits, and we obtained similar results when considering the 95% confidence upper limits of the population.

The oldest pulsars provide the tighest constraints, and these are the most likely to harbor planets, having had sufficient time for disk evolution and planet formation. In this population, we conclude that planets of 0.1-0.2 M[formula] and Pb  <  1 yr are absent from at least two thirds of the sample, and planets with M> 0.6 M[formula] can occur in no more than 5% of systems. Consequently, planet formation within ≈  1.4 AU of neutron stars is at best a rare phenomenon.

Younger systems (0.03 < τc  <  0.3) provide similar but somewhat poorer constraints: planets exceeding 0.3 M[formula] are absent from at least 2/3 of our sample, and planets of mass 1-1.5 M[formula] must be rare, present in no more than 5% of cases. The youngest systems (τc < 0.03) have low sensitivity due to their substantial timing noise. We expect such systems are also too young for planet formation (see §[\ref=sec:discussion_disks]), but for completeness, we note that our limits rule out planets of 1-2 M[formula] in 68% of the very young sample.

Implications for Debris Disks

Our upper limits clearly show that Earth-mass planets are rare or absent within the first ~  2 Myr of the formation of a pulsar. What implication, if any, does this result have for the presence of debris disks around neutron stars? Following [\citet=Phinney93] and [\citet=Miller01], we consider it unlikely that any original planets with periastron <  1 AU could have survived immersion in the stellar envelope or remained bound after the supernova kick, and we concentrate on in situ planet formation.

First, we must ask: does our sample trace the young pulsar distribution? Our sample excludes magnetars and other obviously young but low-[formula] neutron stars, e.g. the weakly magnetized compact central objects [\citep=Halpern10]. However, [\citet=Watters11] and other authors have argued that γ-ray pulsars, with properties similar to our sample, require the bulk of Milky Way supernova activity to account for their numbers. We therefore believe our selection of high-[formula] pulsars presents a minimally biased view of the young pulsar population, but it does not constrain disk formation around less typical neutron stars.

Secondly: given a disk with sufficient mass and angular momentum (radius), does planet formation occur efficiently and produce palpable planets? Fallback disks differ from protoplanetary disks in a key aspect: there is no external source of material. Thus, we appeal to a study aimed at reproducing the properties of planets around PSR B1257+  12. [\citet=Hansen09] found that disks with fallback-like angular momenta and layered viscous accretion can produce Earth-mass planets rapidly (105-107 yr) at inner solar system scales and with relatively small (e < 0.2) eccentricities. Even more encouragingly, they found that annular density profiles produced planets of a few M[formula] in <   1 Myr. Such profiles might result if dust agglomerates into grains quickly after condensation during disk expansion, in which case the disk can deposit most of its dust at the same radius. In these scenarios, two or three planets with mass 1-3 M[formula] populate the inner AU, along with a few residual planitesimals, and would be easily detectable in our sample.

Thus, we can say that if such disks are common around young neutron stars, at least some should host Earth-mass planets and we should detect such in our sample. Moreover, even if rapid sedimentation does not proceed and the mass profile remains more homogeneous, [\citet=Hansen09] find the production of detectable planets is still inevitable and merely proceeds on a 1-10 Myr time-scale. The absence of Earth-mass planets in both our sample and in larger samples including pulsars with τc > 107 yr [\citep=Hobbs10b] seems to rule out such disks.

However, such disks seem to play an important rôle, at least in the pulsar literature. Debris disks have been advanced as triggering magnetospheric reconfiguration [\citep=Cordes08] [\citep=Brook14] [\citep=Kerr14], altering the spin-down histories of pulsars [\citep=Menou01b] [\citep=Yan12], contributing to pulsar timing noise [\citep=Shannon13b], and even enabling the pulsar mechanism [\citep=Michel81]. [\citet=Chatterjee00], among others, have speculated that normal pulsars accreting from a fallback disk may provide the X-ray emission observed in anomalous X-ray pulsars. They may also be responsible for some cases of peculiar supernova light curve evolution [\citep=Dexter13].

Can we save this picture by forming disks that evade our upper limits? After an initial period of super-Eddington accretion, a fallback disk evolves self-similarly provided it remains viscous, transporting angular momentum and a small fraction of the material beyond the tidal disruption radius where planet formation can occur. The magneto-rotational instability [\citep=Balbus91] is generally thought to provide this viscosity so long as the disk remains ionized, but as it cools, thermal ionization instabilities result in rapid condensation, leaving an inactive dust disk [\citep=Menou01]. (Though we note accretion may continue via an active central "layer", in which case [\citet=Currie07] find the disk can reach the right scale for planet formation.) The final radius of such a debris disk depends sensitively on metallicity, and high-metallicity disks generally became inactive at small radii (<  1010 cm), within the tidal disruption radius. Such disks could still form planets, but would first require scattering to move material beyond the tidal disruption radius. Moreover, this process is impeded by ablation of small bodies by the energetic pulsar wind [\citep=Miller01] and cannot proceed until the pulsar's spin-down power [formula] drops low enough.

On the other hand, near impact on a companion from a supernova kick could form a debris disk with large angular momentum [\citep=Phinney93], giving rise to planets with periods too long to be reliably detected in our analysis. We expect such events to be rare, as even in tight binaries the solid angle presented by an unevolved companion is small, and simulations suggest most binaries will have Pb > 10 d [\citep=Terman98]. Our sample contains only two binary systems, supporting the idea that most sample members did not form in close binaries.

Finally, it may be that long-lived debris disks simply fail to form. Stellar material may fall back onto the compact remnant but ultimately be ejected by a propeller phase [\citep=Eksi05]. Or, the pre-supernova conditions may be such that the specific angular momentum of the stellar core is too low to circularize. In this case, the explosion energy either unbinds the entirety of the star, leaving a neutron star, or a huge amount of material falls back, triggering a collapse to a black hole. Recent one-dimensional numerical simulations by [\citet=Perna14] suggest that magnetic coupling saps the specific angular momentum of the stellar core to such a degree that only fine-tuned explosions can produce appreciable fallback onto a neutron star, and the resulting disk lasts only a few hundred seconds.

Summary and Conclusion

We have searched a large sample of young pulsars for periodic modulation characteristic to planetary companions. Our work is an improvement on previous efforts [\citep=Thorsett92], as our pulsar sample is two orders of magnitude larger and we employ sophisticated methods to mitigate pulsar timing noise and model realistic (noncircular) orbits. Despite the good sensitivity to low-mass planets we find no compelling evidence for such systems. We argue that such companions could have formed in debris disks within the 2 Myr age range spanned by our sample, and their absence implies supernova fallback disks are either rare or confined to small radii.

Whence, then, the planets of PSR B1257+  12? [\citet=Miller01] have argued PSR B1257+  12 was born with its present 6 ms spin period and an intrinsically weak magnetic field. Such a weak field may point to atypically weak magnetic coupling in the progenitor stellar core, evading the constraints of [\citet=Perna14]. If this is so, isolated millisecond pulsars with modest spin periods may make excellent targets for direct debris disk searches.
