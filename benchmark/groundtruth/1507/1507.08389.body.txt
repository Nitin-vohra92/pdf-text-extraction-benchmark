Covariant functors and asymptotic stability

Introduction

In this paper, we will extend two results on asymptotic stability by M. Brodmann. Let us begin by fixing some terminology. A ring will mean a commutative ring with unity, unless specified otherwise. For a ring R, we let [formula] denote the category of R-modules and [formula] the category of finitely generated R-modules. A functor will mean a covariant functor. For a nonempty set X and a sequence of elements [formula] of X, we say that asymptotic stability holds for the elements xn, or that the elements xn stabilize, if the sequence [formula] is eventually constant.

For the rest of this section, we will let R be a Noetherian ring unless specified otherwise, [formula] and I,J be ideals of R. The background of our project can be traced back to one of Ratliff's papers.

Brodmann [\cite=BPrime] gave a negative answer to the question, but at the same time, he proved a related, by now well-known result. Using the notation established so far, we will state his first result that we are interested in.

[\cite=BPrime] The sets [formula] and [formula] stabilize.

The second result that we are interested in is as follows.

[\cite=BSpread] The values [formula] and [formula] stabilize.

Most of this paper will be related to Theorem [\ref=thm:BPrime]. There have been numerous generalizations of the theorem over the years. Here are a few of them.

[\cite=MS] The sets [formula] and [formula] stabilize for any [formula].

[\cite=KW] Let [formula] be a complex. Suppose that L'  ⊆  L, M'  ⊆  M and N'  ⊆  N are submodules such that α(L')  ⊆  M' and β(M')  ⊆  N'. For [formula], let [formula] denote the homology of the induced complex

[formula]

Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

[\cite=KW] Let M'  ⊆  M be a submodule. Then for any [formula], the sets [formula] and [formula] stabilize.

A rather extensive introduction to results related to Theorems [\ref=thm:BPrime] and [\ref=thm:BSpread] can be found in [\cite=McA]. However, we will proceed in a different direction. Our main goal is to relate the theorems to the following notions.

[\cite=Har] Let R be a Noetherian ring and [formula]. We say that:

F is representable if [formula] for some [formula];

F is coherent if there exist [formula] and an exact sequence hN  →  hM  →  F  →  0;

F is finitely generated if there exist [formula] and an exact sequence hM  →  F  →  0.

We can now state our main result, which will be proved in several steps in Section [\ref=sec:stab].

Let R be a Noetherian ring, I,J ideals of R, [formula] and F be a coherent functor. Then the sets [formula], [formula] and the values [formula], [formula] stabilize.

A summary of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:twoeg], we consider two covariant R-linear functors, the zeroth local cohomology functor ΓI where I is an ideal of R, and the torsion functor τS where S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R. We show that in most cases, the functors [formula] and [formula] are finitely generated but not coherent, while the functors ΓI and τS are not even finitely generated. However, if [formula], [formula], ΓI or τS, then whether or not F is coherent, the sets [formula] and [formula] always stabilize. In Section [\ref=sec:dd], we consider the case where R is a Dedekind domain. We show that if F is a finitely generated functor, then the sets [formula] stabilize. We give a family of non-finitely generated functors F such that the sets [formula] do not stabilize. In Section [\ref=sec:midfin], we consider a complex [formula] of R-modules where [formula] and the functor [formula], an example of which is the zeroth local cohomology functor. We show that if R is a one-dimensional Noetherian domain, then the sets [formula] stabilize.

Proof of stability results

In the section, we let R be a Noetherian ring. All R-modules will be finitely generated unless specified otherwise. We will prove our main result, Theorem [\ref=thm:main], which will follow from Corollary [\ref=cor:coh], Corollary [\ref=cor:dep] and Corollary [\ref=cor:graded]. First, we need a slightly more general result than Theorem [\ref=thm:KWhom]. We recall that the Theorem follows from an even more general result.

[\cite=KW] Let I  ⊆  R be an ideal, [formula] and U,V,W submodules of T such that W  ⊆  V. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

Consider the situation as in Theorem [\ref=thm:KWhom]. Let [formula] and L1,L2 be submodules of L such that IcL'  ⊆  L2. For [formula], let [formula] denote the homology of the induced complex

[formula]

Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

We follow [\cite=KW]. By the Artin-Rees Lemma, there is [formula] such that for all [formula], [formula]. Then for [formula], we have

[formula]

The result then follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:KWgen] by letting

[formula]

Next, we recall some results from [\cite=Har].

For any [formula] and [formula], there is a natural isomorphism [formula] given by [formula].

Let [formula] be a complex of finitely generated R-modules. Then for any [formula], the functor [formula] is coherent.

Let [formula]. Then for any [formula], the functors [formula] are coherent.

We then obtain the following generalization of the first half of Theorem [\ref=thm:BPrime]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:Har][\ref=item:torext], Corollary [\ref=cor:coh] may also be viewed as a generalization of Corollary [\ref=cor:KW].

Let F be a coherent functor, [formula], M' be a submodule of M and I  ⊆  R an ideal. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

Let F be given by hL  →  hK  →  F  →  0. By Lemma [\ref=lem:Har][\ref=item:nat], the map hL  →  hK arises from a map f:K  →  L. Choose free resolutions of K and L and a lift of f such that the following diagram commutes.

[formula]

Apply [formula] to get the commutative diagram

[formula]

where f*n,α*n,β*n,γ*n are induced by f,α,β,γ respectively. Then we have

[formula]

Similarly, we apply [formula] to ([\ref=eqn:lift]) to get maps α*,β*,γ* induced by α,β,γ respectively. Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. As in the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:KWhom], there is [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula], and hence

[formula]

The result then follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:KWhom].

We next generalize the first half of Theorem [\ref=thm:BSpread] along similar lines.

The values [formula] stabilize.

First, suppose that [formula] for infinitely many n. Then by Theorem [\ref=thm:KWgen], we see that [formula] for large n. So for all large n, we have Tn / JTn  =  0 and hence [formula]. Hence we may assume that Tn  ≠  JTn for large n.

The rest of the proof is the same as that in [\cite=BSpread]. We let [formula], [formula] if such exists, and prove by induction on hT that [formula]. Suppose that hT  =  0. Then [formula] for infinitely many n. By Theorem [\ref=thm:KWgen], we have [formula] for all large n, so [formula].

Now suppose that hT  >  0. Then by Theorem [\ref=thm:KWgen], there is x∈J such that [formula] for all large n. Writing [formula], we have [formula] for all large n. Hence [formula]. By induction, we have [formula], so [formula].

Let J  ⊆  R be an ideal. Consider the situation as in Corollary [\ref=cor:KWhom] with the complexes

[formula]

and [formula] denoting the homology of the complex. Then the values [formula] stabilize.

Let F be a coherent functor, [formula], M' be a submodule of M and I,J be ideals of R. Then the values [formula] stabilize.

In order to generalize the rest of Theorems [\ref=thm:BPrime] and [\ref=thm:BSpread], we let [formula] be a Noetherian R-algebra generated in degree 1 with R0  =  R. We will use a result from [\cite=MS].

[\cite=MS] Let [formula] be a finitely generated graded S-module. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

Let L  →  M  →  N be a complex of [formula]-graded S-modules, where the maps are homogeneous and [formula]. Let [formula] be the homology of the complex. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

Let [formula] be a finitely generated graded S-module, for example the module H as in Corollary [\ref=cor:gradedap]. Let J be an ideal of R. Then the values [formula] stabilize.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:Bdepth] works, since [formula] and M / xM are also finitely generated graded S-modules.

Let I be an ideal of R, [formula] and M'  ⊆  M be a submodule. Then the sets [formula] and the values [formula] stabilize.

As in Corollary [\ref=cor:coh], we apply [formula] to ([\ref=eqn:lift]) to get

[formula]

Again we have [formula] , where α*n,β*n,γ*n are the maps induced by α,β,γ in ([\ref=eqn:lift]) respectively, so the result follows from Corollaries [\ref=cor:gradedap] and [\ref=cor:gradeddep] by letting [formula].

A coherent functor F given by hL  →  hK  →  F  →  0 can be considered as a functor [formula] since hL and hK are (cf. [\cite=Har]). So the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:graded] gives the next result.

Let F be a coherent functor, [formula], M'  ⊆  M be a submodule, I be an ideal of R, [formula] and [formula]. Then:

[formula] is a finitely generated graded S-module.

When M'  =  IM, [formula] is a finitely generated graded [formula]-module.

The module structures over S and [formula] in [\ref=item:rees] and [\ref=item:gri] respectively correspond to the multiplication maps given by applying F to [formula], where x∈Im.

Examples of non-coherent functors with asymptotic stability

In view of the results in Section [\ref=sec:stab], one may be interested in knowing whether or not a R-linear covariant functor is coherent. Some important examples of coherent functors are given in Lemma [\ref=lem:Har]. In this section, we will study the zeroth local cohomology functor [formula] where I is an ideal of R, and the torsion functor τS where S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R. It turns out that if F  =  ΓI, τS, [formula] or [formula], then the functor F is usually not coherent. However, we will see that whether or not F is coherent, the sets [formula] and [formula] always stabilize.

Let R be a Noetherian ring and F be a finitely generated functor given by [formula]. Then for any [formula] and x∈F(N), there is [formula] such that [formula]. In particular, [formula].

If x∈F(N), then we let [formula] be such that TN(f) = x. The result follows from the commutative diagram

Let R be a Noetherian ring and {Fλ}λ∈Λ be a direct system of functors in [formula]. Let [formula] be given by {  Tλ:Fλ  →  F  }λ∈Λ. If [formula] and is finitely generated, then [formula] for some λ0∈Λ. In particular, if Tλ is injective for all λ∈Λ, then F  =  Fλ for all [formula].

Let F be given by hM  →  F  →  0. Since [formula], there is λ0∈Λ such that [formula]. Let [formula] and x∈F(N). By Lemma [\ref=lem:Yon], there is [formula] such that [formula].

[formula]

Therefore F  =  Tλ0(Fλ0).

In the following, we will consider two applications of Corollary [\ref=cor:dirlim].

Let I be an ideal of a Noetherian ring R. The following are equivalent:

ΓI is representable.

ΓI is finitely generated.

In  =  In + 1 for some [formula].

For all [formula], we have [formula]. So by Corollary [\ref=cor:dirlim], ΓI is finitely generated iff there exists [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula] iff In  =  In + 1 for some [formula] by considering M  =  R / In + 1 for "only if".

The relationship between our result and Section [\ref=sec:stab] is as follows.

[\cite=Har] Let F,G be coherent functors and T:F  →  G be a natural transformation. Then ker (T), [formula] and [formula] are also coherent.

Let R be a Noetherian ring, I  ⊆  R be an ideal and [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula], where [formula].

Let [formula] be a sequence of modules in [formula] such that the sets [formula] stabilize. Let I  ⊆  R be an ideal. If In  ≠  In + 1 for any n, then the functor [formula] is finitely generated but not coherent, and ΓI is not finitely generated. However, whether or not In  =  In + 1 for any n, the sets [formula] and [formula] always stabilize.

Now we consider our second example.

Let R be a ring, possibly noncommutative, with 1. Let S  ⊆  R and f:S  ×  S  →  R be a function. The following are equivalent:

For every r,s∈S, left R-module M and m∈M, if rm  =  0, then f(r,s)m  =  f(s,r)m  =  0.

For every r,s∈S we have [formula].

[\ref=item:anymod] ⇒   [\ref=item:justr]: Let r,s∈S and M  =  R / Rr. Then [formula]. By assumption, we have [formula], so f(r,s)∈Rr. Similarly, with M  =  R / Rs we have f(r,s)∈Rs, so that [formula].

[\ref=item:justr] ⇒   [\ref=item:anymod]: Let r,s∈S and m∈M. By assumption, f(r,s),f(s,r)∈Rr. So if rm  =  0, then f(r,s)m,f(s,r)m∈Rrm  =  0.

Let R be a commutative ring with 1.

We say that a subset S  ⊆  R is common multiplicatively closed if [formula] and there is a function f:S  ×  S  →  S satisfying any condition in Lemma [\ref=lem:cmc], or equivalently, for any r,s∈S there is f(r,s)∈S that satisfies any condition in Lemma [\ref=lem:cmc].

We say that a (nonempty) subset S  ⊆  R is coprincipal if there is s∈S such that [formula]. Such an s is called a cogenerator of S.

For any S  ⊆  R and [formula], we let [formula]. If S is common multiplicatively closed, then τS(M) is a submodule of M.

Let R be a Noetherian ring and S be a common multiplicatively closed subset of R. The following are equivalent:

τS is representable.

τS is finitely generated.

S is coprincipal.

First, we note that for all [formula], [formula], where s runs through S and [formula] iff (s)  ⊆  (t). So by Corollary [\ref=cor:dirlim], τS is finitely generated iff there exists s∈S such that [formula] for all [formula] iff there exists s∈S such that (s)  ⊆  (r) for all r∈S by considering M  =  R / (r) for "only if".

Let R be a ring and S be a subset of R. Consider the following statements.

S is coprincipal.

There are rings R1,R2 such that R  =  R1  ×  R2, [formula] and for all s∈S we have s(1,0)∈(R1)×.

Then [\ref=item:idem] ⇒   [\ref=item:coprin]. If S is furthermore multiplicatively closed, then [\ref=item:coprin] ⇒   [\ref=item:idem].

[\ref=item:idem] ⇒   [\ref=item:coprin]: Let [formula] and s∈S. Since s(1,0)∈(R1)×, (u,0)∈Rs. Therefore (u,0) is a cogenerator of S.

Now suppose that S is multiplicatively closed and coprincipal with cogenerator e. Since S is multiplicatively closed, e2∈S. Since e is a cogenerator of S, e = re2 for some r∈R. Then (re)2  =  r(re2)  =  re, so re is idempotent. Let R1  =  R(re) and R2  =  R(1 - re), so that R  =  R1  ×  R2. Then e(re)  =  re2  =  e, so e∈R1, and e(r2e)  =  (re)2  =  re, so [formula]. Finally, let s∈S. Then e  =  r's for some r'∈R, and (r'r2e)(sre)  =  (re)3  =  re, so sre∈(R1)×.

Let R be a ring, S  ⊆  R and [formula]. If τS(M) is a submodule of M, then [formula]. If R is Noetherian and S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R, then [formula].

Let R be a Noetherian ring, S be a multiplicatively closed subset of R and [formula] be a sequence of modules in [formula] such that the sets [formula] stabilize. If S is not coprincipal, then the functor [formula] is finitely generated but not coherent, and τS is not finitely generated. However, whether or not S is coprincipal, the sets [formula] and [formula] always stabilize.

Covariant functors over a Dedekind domain

In Section 2, we saw that the sets [formula] stabilize whenever F is a coherent functor. One may ask whether such asymptotic stability still holds when F is not coherent. In this section, we consider the case where R is a Dedekind domain. We will see that if F is a finitely generated functor over R, then the sets [formula] stabilize. We then construct a family of examples of R-linear covariant functors F such that the sets [formula] do not stabilize.

Let R be a ring, F be an R-linear functor from [formula] to itself and [formula]. Then [formula].

Let R be a Dedekind domain, I be an ideal of R, [formula] and F be a finitely generated functor. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

The proof will proceed in several steps.

Step 1. First, we will make some reductions. Since F is R-linear, it preserves finite direct sums. By the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain, we may assume that M  =  J is an ideal of R or M  =  R / Pi for some maximal ideal P of R and [formula]. If M  =  R / Pi, then either M / InM  =  0 for all n or M / InM  =  M for all [formula]. If 0  ≠  M  =  J  ⊆  R and I  ≠  0, then [formula] for all [formula]. But R / In is again a direct sum of modules of the form R / Pni. So it suffices to show that asymptotic stability holds for [formula], where P is a maximal ideal of R. Furthermore, by Lemma [\ref=lem:ann], [formula] or [formula] for all [formula]. So we only need to show that F(R / Pn) is either always 0 or always nonzero for all large n.

Step 2. Let F be given by the surjection hL  →  F, where [formula]. First we consider the case where L = J is an ideal of R. Suppose that F(R / Pn) = 0 for infinitely many n. We will show that in fact F(R / Pn) = 0 for all n, which will conclude this case. So fix [formula]. Let [formula] be such that F(R / PN) = 0. Let π:R / PN  →  R / Pn be the natural projection map. Since J is a projective R-module, the map hJ(π):hJ(R / PN)  →  hJ(R / Pn) is surjective. From the commutative diagram

[formula]

we see that F(π) is surjective and therefore F(R / Pn) = 0.

Step 3. Next, we consider the case where L = R / Qi such that Q is a maximal ideal of R and [formula]. We may assume that Q = P. Suppose that F(R / PN) = 0 for some [formula]. We will show that in fact F(R / Pn) = 0 for all [formula], concluding this case. We recall the following facts. For any [formula], R / Pn1 is a principal ideal ring. Choose an element [formula]. Then Pn2 / Pn1 is generated by pn2 for all [formula]. Now fix [formula]. Let pn - N:R / PN  →  R / Pn denote multiplication by pn - N. Again from the commutative diagram

[formula]

we see that F(pn - N) is surjective and therefore F(R / Pn) = 0.

Step 4. Finally, we consider the general case where [formula] such that [formula] are ideals, [formula] are maximal ideals of R and [formula]. Again we may assume that [formula]. Suppose that F(R / Pn) = 0 for infinitely many n. Fix [formula] such that F(R / PN) = 0. Then repeating Steps 2 and 3, we see that for all [formula], each direct summand of [formula] is mapped to 0 in F(R / Pn). Therefore F(R / Pn) = 0 for all [formula].

Let R be a Dedekind domain, I be an ideal of R and [formula]. Then the modules InM  /  In + 1M are all isomorphic for large n. In particular, let F be an R-linear functor from [formula] to itself. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

As in Step 1 of Theorem [\ref=thm:dd], we may assume that M = J is an ideal of R or M = R / Pi for some maximal ideal P of R and [formula]. If M = J  ≠  0 and I  ≠  0, then [formula] for all [formula]. If M  =  R / Pi, then InM  /  In + 1M  =  0 for all [formula].

Let R be a Dedekind domain and I  ≠  0 be an ideal of R. Then there exists [formula] such that the sets [formula] do not stabilize. In fact, we may construct F such that [formula] is given by any sequence of subsets of [formula].

First, let [formula] be the subcategory of finitely generated torsion R-modules. Then the torsion functor [formula] is R-linear. Next, we recall from category theory that any category is naturally equivalent to any skeleton of itself. In particular, given a skeleton [formula] of [formula], there is an R-linear functor [formula]. Therefore it suffices to construct [formula] as in our Theorem.

We will define [formula] as follows. Fix a linear ordering [formula] of the nonzero prime ideals R, and let the objects of [formula] be modules of the form [formula], where [formula] and [formula] whenever Pi  =  Pi + 1. For each maximal ideal P we choose a subset SP of [formula]. Then we define F(R / Pe)  =  R / P if e∈SP, and 0 otherwise. We let [formula], where k is the number of F(R / Peii) that are nonzero. Next we define F(f) for f:M  →  N, where [formula]. It suffices to consider the case where M,N are both P-torsion for some maximal ideal P of R. Fix an element [formula]. Then [formula] is generated by pn2 - n1 if [formula], and [formula] if [formula]. So we can identify f with a square matrix with entries in R (more precisely, in R / Pei for suitable ei) viewed as multiplication maps, adding rows or columns of zeroes if necessary. If M,N are both direct sums of copies of [formula] with [formula], then we define

[formula]

where the entries in the lower diagonal of the matrix on the left are multiples of p, and [formula] are the square blocks that correspond to [formula] respectively. Since F(R / Pe)  =   either R / P or 0, the definition of F(f) does not depend on the choice of coset representatives in the entries of f. It is then immediate that F preserves identity maps and is R-linear. Finally, if f:M  →  N and g:N  →  L where M,N,L are P-torsion, then

[formula]

Therefore F respects composition.

The functors constructed in Theorem [\ref=thm:osc] are not finitely generated.

Functors arising from middle finite complexes

In this section, we will study a class of R-linear covariant functors F which arise naturally and are non-finitely generated in general. An example of such kind of functor is the zeroth local cohomology functor. We will obtain results that are related to all the previous sections. Our main result is that over a one-dimensional Noetherian domain R, the sets [formula] stabilize.

Let R be a ring and [formula] be a complex of R-modules.

We say that an R-linear functor [formula] arises from [formula] if [formula].

We say that [formula] is middle finite if [formula].

Let R be a Noetherian ring. Let F be a functor that arises from the middle finite complex [formula]. Then F is coherent iff it is finitely generated.

Suppose that F is finitely generated and is given by the surjection hM  →  F. Let K,I denote the functors given by [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] and n∈K(N) be such that n  +  I(N)∈F(N). By Lemma [\ref=lem:Yon], there is [formula] such that [formula]. That is, there are m∈K(M) and [formula] such that [formula]. Now [formula], where D ranges over all finitely generated submodules of C. Since [formula], there is a finitely generated submodule C0 of C that contains [formula] such that [formula]. From the commutative diagram

[formula]

we see that in fact [formula]. Finally, let A0 be a finitely generated submodule of A such that ∂A(A0)  =  ∂A(A). Then F arises from the complex A0  →  B  →  C0. Therefore F is coherent by Lemma [\ref=lem:Har].

Let R be a Noetherian ring, I,J be ideals of R, [formula], M' be a submodule of M and F be a functor that arises from the middle finite complex A  →  B  →  C. Then the sets [formula] and the values [formula] stablize.

The module [formula] is finitely generated and graded over [formula], and the maps in the induced complex

[formula]

are homogenous of degree 0. The result then follows from Corollaries [\ref=cor:gradedap] and [\ref=cor:gradeddep].

Let R be a one-dimensional Noetherian domain, I be an ideal of R, [formula] and F be a functor that arises from the middle finite complex [formula]. Then the sets [formula] stabilize.

First, since [formula], it suffices to show that the sets [formula] stabilize. We have [formula], so

[formula]

where F' arises from the complex 0  →  B / α(A)  →  C. So we may assume that A = 0. Furthermore, since localization is flat, we may assume that R is local of dimension one. So it remains to show that F(R / In) is either always 0 or always nonzero for all large n.

Now let [formula] and [formula] be the map induced by β with graded components γn. By Corollary [\ref=cor:gradedap], there is N so large such that the sets [formula] are equal for all n  >  N. Again we have βn:B / In + 1B  →  C / In + 1C, so that F(R / In)  =   ker βn - 1. Suppose that there is m  >  N such that ker βm - 1  =  0 but ker βm  ≠  0. Then [formula], so that 0  ≠   ker βm  ⊆   ker γm, and hence ker γn  ≠  0 for all n  >  N. But ker βn  ⊇   ker γn always holds. Therefore we have ker βn  ≠  0 for all n > N.
