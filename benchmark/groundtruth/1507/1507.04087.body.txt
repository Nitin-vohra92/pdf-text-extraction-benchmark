Two Weak Forms of Countability Axioms in Free Topological Groups

Introduction

In 1941, Markov [\cite=MA1945] introduced the concepts of the free topological group F(X) and the free Abelian topological group A(X) over a Tychonoff space X, respectively. Since then, free topological groups have been a source of various examples and also an interesting topic of study in the theory of topological groups, see [\cite=AT2008]. From the algebraic point of view, the structure of F(X) or A(X) is very simple - it is the free algebraic group over the set X. However, the topological structure of F(X) and A(X) is rather complicated even for simple spaces X. For example, it is a well known fact that if X is a non-discrete space, then neither F(X) nor A(X) is Fréchet-Uryshon, and hence first countable, see [\cite=A1980]. This fact motivates researchers to investigate free topological groups in two directions. The first direction of the research on free topological groups is to study some weak forms of countability axioms in F(X) and A(X) over certain classes of spaces X. In this line, Arhangel'skiı et al. [\cite=AOP1989] considered the following questions on F(X) and A(X) over a metrizable space X: For which spaces X, is F(X) or A(X) a k-space? When is the tightness of F(X) or A(X) countable? They proved that F(X) is a k-space iff X is locally compact separable or discrete; A(X) is a k-space iff X is locally compact and X' is separable, where X' is the derived set of X. Furthermore, the tightness of F(X) is countable iff X is separable or discrete, and the tightness of A(X) is countable iff X' is separable.

The other direction of research on free topological groups is to study (weak) countability axioms of Fn(X) or An(X), where Fn(X) (resp. An(X)) stands for the subset of F(X) (resp. A(X)) formed by all words whose reduced length is at most n. Indeed, Yamada [\cite=Y2002] showed that for a metrizable space X, F3(X) or A3(X) is Fréchet-Uryshon iff X' is compact, and F5(X) is Fréchet-Uryshon iff X is compact or discrete. As applications, characterizations of a metrizable space X are given such that An(X) is Fréchet-Uryshon for each n  ≥  3, and Fn(X) is Fréchet-Uryshon for each n  ≥  3 except for n = 4. The subspaces F4(X) and A4(X) are very special cases. In [\cite=Y1998], Yamada proved that for a metrizable space X, the following are equivalent: (i) Fn(X) is metrizable for each [formula]; (ii) Fn(X) is first countable for each [formula]; (iii) F4(X) is metrizable; (iv) F4(X) is first countable; (v) X is compact or discrete. In the same paper, Yamada also studied the first countability of Fn(X) and An(X) for n = 2,3. It is proved that for a metrizable space X, the following are equivalent: (i) F3(X) is metrizable; (ii) F3(X) is first-countable; (iii) F2(X) is metrizable; (iv) F2(X) is first-countable; (v) X' is compact. Furthermore, for a metrizable space X, the following are also equivalent: (i) A2(X) is first-countable; (ii) A2(X) is metrizable; (iii) An(X) is first-countable for each [formula]; (iv) An(X) is metrizable for each [formula]; (v) X' is compact.

Recently, Li et al. [\cite=LLL] continued the study of F(X) and A(X) along the afore-mentioned first direction. They studied several weak forms of countability axioms of F(X) and A(X) defined by networks over some classes of generalized metric spaces X. More precisely, they studied the concepts of sn-networks, cs-networks, cs*-networks in F(X), A(X), and their subspaces Fn(X) and An(X). Two types of countability axioms defined by these concepts, namely snf-countability and csf-countability, were considered. Among many other things, Li et al. established the following results: For a metrizable and crowded space X, F(X) or A(X) is csf-countable iff X is separable; For a stratifiable k-space X, F(X) is snf-countable iff X is discrete. However, the authors of [\cite=LLL] did not consider the snf-countability and csf-countability of Fn(X) and An(X).

In the paper, we continue the study of free topological group F(X) and the free Abelian topological group A(X) in the afore-mentioned two directions. In particular, we investigate the csf-countability and the snf-countability of F(X), A(X), Fn(X) and An(X) over various classes of generalized metric spaces X. In Section 2, we introduce the necessary notation and terminologies which are used for the rest of the paper. In Section 3, we investigate the snf-countability of free (Abelian) topological groups. First, we provide some characterizations of the snf-countability of F(X), A(X), Fn(X) and An(X) over certain classes of topological spaces. The main theorem in this section generalizes a result of Yamada in [\cite=Y1998]. Section 4 is devoted to the study of the csf-countability of F(X), A(X), Fn(X) and An(X). It is shown that for a non-discrete Lanev space X, F4(X) is csf-countable iff F4(X) is an [formula]-space. This result gives an affirmative answer to an open question in [\cite=LLL]. It is also shown that for a sequential μ-space X, if X' has a countable cs*-network in X, then F3(X) and A(X) are csf-countable. Finally, we pose several interesting open questions in the last section.

Throughout this paper, all topological spaces are assumed to be at least Tychonoff, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Notation and Terminologies

In this section, we introduce the necessary notation and terminologies. First of all, let [formula], [formula] and [formula] denote the sets of all positive integers, all integers and all real numbers, respectively. For undefined terminologies, the reader may refer to [\cite=AT2008], [\cite=E1989] and [\cite=Gr].

Let X be a topological space X and A  ⊆  X be a subset of X. The closure of A in X is denoted by [formula] and the diagonal of X is denoted by Δ(X). The subset A is called [formula]-embedded in X if every bounded continuous real-valued function f defined on A has a bounded continuous extension over X. Moreover, A is called bounded if every continuous real-valued function f defined on A is bounded. If the closure of every bounded set in X is compact, then X is called a μ-space. The derived set of X is denoted by X'. We say that X is crowded if X  =  X'. Recall that X is said to have a Gδ-diagonal (resp. regular Gδ-diagonal) if Δ(X) is a Gδ-set (resp. regular Gδ-set) in X  ×  X. A pseudometric d on X is said to be continuous if d is continuous as a mapping from the product space X  ×  X to [formula]. The space X is called a k-space provided that a subset C  ⊆  X is closed in X if [formula] is closed in K for each compact subset K of X. If there exists a family of countably many compact subsets [formula] of X such that each subset F of X is closed in X provided that [formula] is closed in Kn for each [formula], then X is called a kω-space. Note that every kω-space is a k-space. In addition, X is called a cf-space if every compact subset of X is finite. A subset P of X is called a sequential neighborhood [\cite=FR1965] of x∈X, if each sequence converging to x is eventually in P. A subset U of X is called sequentially open if U is a sequential neighborhood of each of its points. The space X is called a sequential space if each sequentially open subset of X is open. Let κ be an infinite cardinal. For each α∈κ, let Tα be a sequence converging to [formula]. Let [formula] be the topological sum of [formula]. Then [formula] is the quotient space obtained from T by identifying all the points xα∈T to the point x.

Let [formula] be a family of subsets of X. Then, [formula] is called a cs-network [\cite=G1971] at a point x∈X if for every sequence [formula] converging to x and an arbitrary open neighborhood U of x in X there exist an [formula] and an element [formula] such that

[formula]

The space X is called csf-countable if X has a countable cs-network at each point x∈X. We call [formula] a [formula]-network [\cite=LT1994] of X if for every sequence [formula] converging to a point x and an arbitrary open neighborhood U of x in X there is an element [formula] and a subsequence [formula] of [formula] such that [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is called a k-network [\cite=O1971] if for every compact subset K of X and an arbitrary open set U containing K in X there is a finite subfamily [formula] such that [formula]. Recall that a space X is an [formula]-space (resp. [formula]-space) if X has a σ-locally finite (resp. countable) k-network. Let [formula] be a cover of X such that (i) [formula]; (ii) for each point x∈X, if [formula], then [formula] for some [formula]; and (iii) for each point x∈X and each open neighborhood U of x there is some [formula] such that x∈P  ⊆  U. Then, [formula] is called an sn-network [\cite=Lin1996] for X if for each point x∈X, each element of [formula] is a sequential neighborhood of x in X, and X is called snf-countable [\cite=Lin1996] if X has an sn-network [formula] and [formula] is countable for all x∈X. The following implications follow directly from definitions:

[formula]

Note that none of the above implications can be reversed. It is well known that Sω is csf-countable but not snf-countable. Moreover, any space without non-trivial convergent sequences is snf-countable, see Example [\ref=e11].

Given a group G, let eG denote the neutral element of G. If no confusion occurs, we simply use e instead of eG to denote the neutral element of G. Let [formula] be a function. We call N a pre-norm on G if the following conditions are satisfied for all x,y∈G: (i) N(e) = 0; (ii) N(xy- 1)  ≤  N(x) + N(y). If G is a topological space and N is continuous, then we say that N is a continuous pre-norm on G.

Let X be a non-empty Tychonoff space. Throughout this paper, X- 1: = {x- 1:x∈X} and - X:  =  { - x:x∈X}, which are just two copies of X. For every [formula], Fn(X) denotes the subspace of F(X) that consists of all words of reduced length at most n with respect to the free basis X. The subspace An(X) is defined similarly. We always use G(X) to denote topological groups F(X) or A(X), and Gn(X) to Fn(X) or An(X) for each [formula]. Therefore, any statement about G(X) applies to F(X) and A(X), and Gn(X) applies to F(X) and A(X). Let e be the neutral element of F(X) (i.e., the empty word) and 0 be that of A(X). For every [formula] and an element [formula] of [formula] we call [formula] a form. In the Abelian case, [formula] is also called a form for [formula]. This word g is called reduced if it does not contains e or any pair of consecutive symbols of the form xx- 1 or x- 1x. It follows that if the word g is reduced and non-empty, then it is different from the neutral element e of F(X). In particular, each element g∈F(X) distinct from the neutral element can be uniquely written in the form [formula], where n  ≥  1, [formula], xi∈X, and xi  ≠  xi + 1 for each [formula], and the support of [formula] is defined as [formula]. Given a subset K of F(X), we put [formula]. Similar assertions (with the obvious changes for commutativity) are valid for A(X). For every [formula], let [formula] be the natural mapping defined by in(x1,x2,...xn) = x1x2...xn for each [formula]. We also use the same symbol in the Abelian case, that is, it means the natural mapping from [formula] onto An(X). Clearly, each in is a continuous mapping.

The snf-Countability of Free Topological Groups

In this section, we discuss the snf-countability of G(X) and Gn(X) for a given topological space X. First, we provide some general characterizations for the snf-countability of G(X). Then, we give some particular classes of spaces X for which those characterizations hold. Finally, we characterizes the snf-countability of F4(X) for a specific class of spaces X, namely k-spaces with a Gδ-diagonal.

The following theorem generalizes Corollary 4.14 in [\cite=A1980].

For a space X, the following statements are equivalent:

G(X) is snf-countable.

Each Gn(X) contains no non-trivial convergent sequences.

G(X) contains no non-trivial convergent sequences.

The implications (iii) ⇒   (ii) and (iii) ⇒   (i) are obvious.

(ii) ⇒   (iii). Assume that each Gn(X) contains no non-trivial convergent sequences. If G(X) contains a non-trivial convergent sequence S, there is an [formula] such that S  ⊆  Gn(X). This implies that Gn(X) contains a non-trivial convergent sequence, which is a contradiction.

(i) ⇒   (iii). Let G(X) be snf-countable with a countable sn-network [formula] at e, where Un + 1  ⊆  Un for each [formula]. Assume that G(X) contains a non-trivial convergent sequence [formula] converging to e. Without loss of generality, we assume that xi  ≠  e for each [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula]. We may further assume that [formula].

We first consider the case of F(X). For each [formula], let [formula] be the first letter of xi. Put [formula] and [formula]. Obviously, we have [formula]. Without loss of generality, we may assume that |A| = ω. We further assume that [formula]. Take an arbitrary point x∈X. For each [formula], let [formula]. Then [formula] for any m  ≠  n. Indeed, take arbitrary [formula] with m < n, and then pick any g∈Lm and h∈Ln. Since each xi belongs to [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence g  ≠  h, where [formula] and [formula] denote the lengths of g and h, respectively. It is evident that each [formula] converges to e. For each [formula], pick a point [formula]. Then, the sequence [formula] converges to e. However, since [formula] for each [formula], by Corollary 7.4.3 in [\cite=AT2008], the set [formula] is closed and discrete in F(X). A contradiction occurs.

Now, we consider the case of A(X). Let [formula] It is easy to see that [formula] for any m  ≠  n. Obviously, each [formula] converges to e. We can derive a contradiction by a proof similar to that for the case of F(X).

Next, we consider what conditions on a space X can guarantee G(X) to be snf-countable. In the light of Theorem [\ref=thm:freegeneral], one may conjecture that G(X) is snf-countable if X contains no non-trivial convergent sequences. Unfortunately, this is not true, since there is a countably compact and separable cf-space X such that A(X) and F(X) contain a non-trivial convergent sequence, refer to Theorem 3.5 in [\cite=T2013]. Nevertheless, by applying Theorem [\ref=thm:freegeneral] to some special classes of topological spaces, we obtain the following result.

For a space X, G(X) is snf-countable if one of the following holds:

X is a cf- and μ-space;

Every countable discrete subset of X is [formula]-embedded.

(i) It suffices to show that G(X) is a cf-space. If K  ⊆  G(X) is compact, then K  ⊆  Gn(X) for some [formula]. Let [formula]. Then Z is a compact subset in X, as X is a μ-space. Hence Z is finite. Since [formula] (in Abelian case, [formula]), K must be finite. Therefore, G(X) is snf-countable.

(ii) Since X is a space in which every countable discrete subset is [formula]-embedded, it follows from Porposition 2.4 in [\cite=T2013] that G(X) contains no non-trivial convergent sequences. Therefore, by Theorem [\ref=thm:freegeneral], G(X) is snf-countable.

A topological space X is extremely disconnected if the closure of every open subset is open. Since every countable discrete subset of an extremely disconnected space X is [formula]-embedded, by Theorem [\ref=thm:cf_snf_countable], G(X) is snf-countable. As a particular example, the Stone-ech compactification βD of any discrete space D is extremely disconnected, and hence G(βD) is snf-countable.

If X is a topological group, then we can characterize the snf-countability of G(X) in terms of the property that X contains no non-trivial convergent sequences, as it is shown in the next result.

For a topological group X, G(X) is snf-countable if and only if X contains no non-trivial convergent sequences.

The necessity is obvious by Theorem [\ref=thm:freegeneral]. To show the sufficiency, suppose that X contains no non-trivial convergent sequences. By Theorem [\ref=thm:freegeneral], it suffices to show that G(X) contains no non-trivial convergent sequences. We only consider the case of F(X), since the proof for the case of A(X) is quite similar. Assume that F(X) contains a non-trivial convergent sequence. It follows from [\cite=T2013] that there are two sequences [formula] and [formula] in X such that [formula] is infinite, xn  ≠  yn for each [formula] and for every continuous pseudometric d on X, and d(xn,yn)  ≥  1 for at most finitely many [formula]. Let [formula]. Then S is a non-trivial sequence.

We claim that S is convergent to e in X. If not, there exists an open neighborhood U of e in X and an infinite set [formula] such that [formula] for each n∈A. By Theorem 3.3.9 in [\cite=AT2008], there exists a continuous pre-norm N on X such that {g∈X:N(g) < 1}  ⊆  U. Define a continuous pseudometric d on X by d(x,y) = N(x- 1y), for all x,y∈X. It follows that d(xn,yn)  ≥  1 for all n∈A. However, this is impossible, since by the construction of [formula] and [formula], d(xn,yn)  ≥  1 holds only for at most finitely many n∈A. Thus, S is a non-trivial sequence in X converging to e. This contradicts with the fact that X contains no non-trivial convergent sequences.

To see how Theorem [\ref=thm:non_trivial_cs] can be applied, we need to identify some classes of topological groups that contain no non-trivial convergence sequences. By a result of [\cite=B2012], every hereditarily normal topological group without a Gδ-diagonal contains no non-trivial convergent sequences, and thus G(X) is snf-countable for such a topological group X. On the other hand, every infinite compact group X contains a non-trivial convergent sequence, as it contains a copy of the Cantor cube {0,1}w(X), where w(X) is the weight of X. Hence, G(X) is not snf-countable for any infinite compact group X. Note that there are infinite pseudocompact topological groups containing no non-trivial convergent sequences, refer to [\cite=Si1969] for the existence of such a topological group.

Next, we discuss the snf-countability of subspaces Fn(X) of F(X) for a space X. Recall that a subspace Y of a space X is said to be P-embedded in X if each continuous pseudometric on Y admits a continuous extensions over X.

Let X be a space with a regular Gδ-diagonal. If F4(X) is snf-countable, then X is either a cf-space or compact.

Suppose that X contains an infinite compact subset C. We show that X must be compact. Since X has a regular Gδ-diagonal, then C must be a metrizable subspace. Without loss of generality, we may assume that C is a non-trivial convergent sequence with its limit point x. Since by a result in [\cite=AB2006] any pseudocompact space with a regular Gδ-diagonal is metrizable and compact, we only need to show that X is pseudocompact. Assume that X is not pseudocompact. Then X contains an infinite and discrete sequence of open subsets [formula]. Note that [formula] is also discrete in X. Therefore, [formula] is closed in X. Since C is compact, we may assume that [formula]. It follows that [formula] is discrete in X. For each [formula], take a point xn∈Un. Then, [formula] is closed, σ-compact and P-embedded in X. By a result in [\cite=U1991], the subgroup F(Y,X) of F(X) generated by Y is topologically isomorphic to F(Y). Obviously, F(Y) is a kω-space. We claim that F4(Y) contains a closed copy of Sω. For each [formula], put Cn: = xnCx- 1x- 1n. Let [formula]. Then Z  ⊆  F(Y) is closed. Since F(Y) is a kω-space, Z is also a kω-subspace. Take an arbitrary infinite subset

[formula]

Then P is a discrete closed subset of Z, since Z is a kω-space. Therefore, the claim is verified. It follows that Sω must be snf-countable, which is a contradiction.

The following theorem generalizes Theorem 4.9 in [\cite=Y1998].

For a k-space X with a regular Gδ-diagonal, the following are equivalent:

F4(X) is snf-countable.

Each Fn(X) is snf-countable.

F4(X) is metrizable.

Each Fn(X) is metrizable.

X is discrete or compact.

Obviously, we have (ii) ⇒   (i), (iv) ⇒   (iii), (iv) ⇒   (ii) and (iii) ⇒   (i). It suffices to show that (i) ⇒   (v) and (v) ⇒   (iv).

(i) ⇒   (v). Since X has a regular Gδ-diagonal, it follows from Theorem [\ref=t11] that either each compact subset of X is finite or X is compact and metrizable. Moreover, it is easy to check that a k-space is discrete if each compact subset is finite. Therefore, X is discrete or compact.

(v) ⇒   (iv). If X is discrete, then F(X) is discrete, hence each Fn(X) is metrizable. If X is compact, then X is a compact metrizable space since a compact space with a Gδ-diagonal is metrizable [\cite=Gr]. Moreover, since each in is continuous, each Fn(X) is compact. Therefore, each Fn(X) is metrizable.

The next example shows that the condition that X is "a k-space" in Theorem [\ref=thm:subspacefree] cannot be dropped.

There is an infinite, non-discrete, cf-space X with a regular Gδ-diagonal such that F4(X) is snf-countable. Let [formula] be the Stone-ech compactification of [formula] (equipped with the discrete topology). Take an arbitrary point [formula], and consider the subspace [formula] of [formula]. It is well known that X is not compact. Indeed, X is a non-discrete cf-space with a regular Gδ-diagonal. However, as shown in [\cite=LLL], F(X) is snf-countable. Thus F4(X) is also snf-countable.

By Theorem 4.12 in [\cite=Y1998], it is easy to see that "F4(X)" in Theorem [\ref=thm:subspacefree] cannot be replaced by "F3(X)". However, we have the following result.

Let X be a stratifiable k-space. If G2(X) is snf-countable, then X' is compact.

We only consider the case of A2(X), as the proof of the F2(X) case is quite similar.

Suppose that X' is not compact. Then, X' is not countably compact since X is stratifiable. Therefore, there is a closed, countable, infinite and discrete subset [formula] in X'. Since X is paracompact, we can choose a discrete family [formula] of open subsets in X such that xn∈Un for each [formula]. For each [formula], since X is sequential and [formula], we can choose a non-trivial sequence [formula] such that [formula] converges to xn and [formula]. Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Obviously, each sequence [formula] converges to 0 in A2(X) and [formula] is a discrete family in X.

We claim that the subspace C is a copy of Sω. Indeed, the subspace S, defined by

[formula]

is closed in [formula]. Since X is paracompact, it follows from Proposition 4.8 in [\cite=Y1998] that i2 is a closed map. Then [formula] is a quotient mapping. Therefore, C  ⊆  A2(X) is homeomorphic to Sω, and this verifies the claim. Since A2(X) is snf-countable, then C is snf-countable. This contradicts with the fact that Sω is not snf-countable.

Note that in general, the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm:derivedset] does not hold. To see this, consider the space Sω. It is easy to check that Sω is a stratifiable k-space whose set of non-isolated points is compact. However, neither Sω nor G2(Sω) is snf-countable.

The csf-Countability of Free Topological Groups

In this section, we discuss the csf-countability of G(X) and Gn(X) for a given space X. First of all, we have the following simple observation.

For a space X, G(X) is csf-countable iff Gn(X) is csf-countable for all [formula].

It is clear that if G(X) is csf-countable, then each Gn(X) is csf-countable.

Conversely, if each Gn(X) is csf-countable with a cs-network [formula] at e, then it is easy to check that [formula] is a cs-network for G(X) at e. Hence, if Gn(X) is csf-countable for all [formula], then G(X) is csf-countable.

In the light of Proposition [\ref=prop:csf], one of our purposes in this section is to identify those classes of spaces X for which the csf-countability of Gn(X) at certain level [formula] will be adequate to guarantee the csf-countability of G(X).

For a paracompact, crowded, k- and [formula]-space X, the following are equivalent:

G(X) is csf-countable.

G2(X) is csf-countable.

X is separable.

Since (i) ⇒   (ii) is trivial, we only need to show (ii) ⇒   (iii) and (iii) ⇒   (i). Further, we only consider A(X), as the proof of the case of F(X) is quite similar.

(ii) ⇒   (iii). Suppose X is not separable. Since X is an [formula]-space, there is a closed, uncountable and discrete subset {xα:α  <  ω1} in X. Since X is paracompact, we can choose a discrete family of open subsets {Uα:α  <  ω1} in X such that xα∈Uα for each α  <  ω1. For each α  <  ω1, since X is sequential, we can choose a non-trivial sequence [formula], convergent to xα. Put

[formula]

and let [formula]. Obviously, [formula] is convergent to 0 in A2(X) and {Yα:α  <  ω1} is a discrete family in X. We claimed that C is a copy of Sω1. Indeed, let

[formula]

Then S is closed in [formula]. Since X is paracompact, by Proposition 4.8 in [\cite=Y1998], i2 is a closed map. It follows that [formula] is a quotient mapping, and thus C  ⊆  A2(X) is homeomorphic to Sω1. Since A2(X) is csf-countable, then C is csf-countable. However, Sω1 is not csf-countable, which is a contradiction.

(iii) ⇒   (i). Let X be separable. Then X is an [formula]-space. By Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=AOP1989], A(X) is an [formula]-space. Thus, A(X) is csf-countable.

The following theorem provides an affirmative answer to Question 3.9 in [\cite=LLL]. Recall that a topological space X is said to be Lanev if it is the closed image of some metric space.

Let X be a non-discrete Lanev space. Then F4(X) is csf-countable if and only if F(X) is an [formula]-space.

The sufficiency is obvious. To show the necessity, let F4(X) be csf-countable. Then X contains no copy of Sω1, and hence X is an [formula]-space. By Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=AOP1989], it suffices to show that X is an [formula]-space. Since X is an [formula]-space, the proof will be completed if we can show that each closed and discrete subset of X is at most countable. Assume that X contains an uncountable, closed and discrete subset D = {dα:α  <  ω1}. Since X is a non-discrete Lanev space, there exists a non-trivial convergent sequence [formula] with the limit point x in X such that [formula] is a closed copy of X, where [formula]. Since [formula] is a closed subspace of F4(X), [formula] is csf-countable.

Next, we shall show that [formula] contains a copy of Sω. To this end, for each α  <  ω1, define [formula]. Then Cα converges to e. Let [formula]. Obviously, [formula], which implies that C is csf-countable. Then C has a countable cs-network [formula] at e. Put

[formula]

and

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] is a countable infinite set and B is a countable set. It is easy to see that [formula] is a countable cs-network at e in

[formula]

Moreover, for each [formula], the set Pn intersects uncountably many Cα. Inductively, we can find a countable infinite subset [formula] of ω1 such that αn  ≠  αm if n  ≠  m and [formula] for each [formula]. Let [formula]. It is clear that [formula]. We claim that Y is homeomorphic to Sω. Indeed, let Z = (Y). Then, Z is a countable, infinite, locally compact and closed subspace in [formula]. Hence, F(Z) is a sequential space by Theorem 7.6.36 in [\cite=AT2008]. Moreover, F(Z) is a subspace of [formula], since [formula] is metrizable and Z is closed in [formula]. Assume that Y is not a copy of Sω. Then there is a non-trivial convergent sequence [formula] in Y. Since Z is paracompact, the closure of [formula] in Z is compact. However, [formula] is an infinite, closed and discrete subspace in Z, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the claim is verified.

Finally, pick an arbitrary point [formula] for each [formula]. Since the family [formula] is a countable cs-network at e in Y, e is a cluster point of the set [formula], which is a contradiction. Therefore, each closed and discrete subset of X is at most countable.

For a non-discrete metrizable space X, the following are equivalent:

X is separable.

F(X) is an [formula]-space.

F(X) is csf-countable.

F4(X) is csf-countable.

By Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=AOP1989], we have (i) ⇔   (ii). Moreover, (ii) ⇒   (iii) and (iii) ⇒   (iv) are obvious. Finally, (iv) ⇒   (ii) follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:level4_csf].

(i) Theorem [\ref=thm:level4_csf] does't hold for the Abelian case, refer to Theorem 4.5 in [\cite=Y1998].

(ii) In Corollary [\ref=cor:level4_csf], F4(X) cannot be replaced by F3(X). Let [formula], where D is an uncountable discrete space and S is a non-trivial convergent sequence with its limit. Then, F3(X) is metrizable by Theorem 4.12 in [\cite=Y1998], hence it is csf-countable. However, X is not separable.

(iii) The conclusion of Corollary [\ref=cor:level4_csf] does not hold for the snf-countability. Consider [formula] with the usual Euclidean topology. By Corollary [\ref=cor:level4_csf], [formula] is an [formula]-space. However, it follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:subspacefree] that [formula] is not snf-countable.

Next, we shall consider the question when G3(X) is csf-countable for a given space X. First, we recall an important lemma in [\cite=S2005].

If [formula] is a countable [formula]-network at x∈X, then the family

[formula]

is a countable cs-network at x.

Let X be a sequential and μ-space. If X' has a countable cs*-network in X, then F3(X) is csf-countable.

Let [formula] be a countable cs*-network for X' in X. By Lemma [\ref=lcs], X is csf-countable. Hence, [formula] is csf-countable for each [formula]. Moreover, since [formula] is open in F3(X) and homeomorphic to a subspace of [formula], F3(X) is csf-countable at each point of [formula]. In what follows, we shall show that F3(X) is also csf-countable at each point of F1(X). To this end, take an arbitrary point g∈F1(X). By Lemma [\ref=lcs], we are done if we can prove that F3(X) has a countable cs*-network at g. We divide the proof in three cases.

Case 1. The point g is isolated in [formula].

In this case, let

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]. We verify that [formula] is a cs*-network for F3(X) at g. Take an arbitrary sequence [formula] converging to g in F3(X) and an open neighborhood U of g in F3(X). Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula] is a non-trivial convergent sequence such that that xn  ≠  xm whenever n  ≠  m. By Theorem 1.5 in [\cite=AOP1989], [formula] is bounded in X. Since X is a μ-space, [formula] is compact in X. Let

[formula]

Then Z is sequentially compact. For each [formula], pick a point [formula]. Then it follows from the sequential compactness of X that [formula] has a subsequence [formula] converging to z = (z1,z2,z3) for some z∈Z3. Since xn  ≠  xm for any n  ≠  m, the sequence [formula] is a non-trivial sequence. Hence, we have that z∈i- 13(g), [formula] for each i∈{1,2,3}, |{i:i  ≤  3,zi  ≠  g}| is an even number, z1 = g or z3 = g, and [formula]. Then z∈{(g,z2,z- 12),(z- 12,z2,g)}. Without loss of generality, we assume that z1 = g,z2∈X' and z = (g,z2,z- 12). Pick an open neighborhood V of z2 in X such that {g}  ×  V  ×  V- 1  ⊆  i- 13(U). Since g is isolated in [formula] and the sequence [formula] converges to g in [formula], zi(1) = g for all but finitely many i. Then, since [formula] is a cs*-network for X', it is easy to see that there exist [formula] such that z2∈P1  ⊆  V, z- 12∈P- 12  ⊆  V- 1 and z∈{g}  ×  P1  ×  P- 12 contains a subsequence of [formula]. Hence, g∈gP1P- 12  ⊆  gVV- 1  ⊆  U and gP1P- 12 contains a subsequence of [formula].

Case 2. The point g is non-isolated in [formula].

Without loss of generality, we assume that g∈X. In this case, let

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]. We verify that [formula] is a cs*-network for F3(X) at g. Take an arbitrary sequence [formula] converging to g in F3(X) and an open neighborhood U of g in F3(X). Next we shall show that there exists a [formula] such that g∈P  ⊆  U and P contains a subsequence of [formula]. Without loss of generality, we assume that [formula] is a non-trivial convergent sequence such that that xn  ≠  xm whenever n  ≠  m.

Subcase 2.1. The sequence [formula] contains a subsequence [formula] which is contained in X.

Since [formula] is a cs*-network for X' in X, there exists a [formula] such that P contains a subsequence of [formula] and g∈P  ⊆  U. Hence, [formula] contains a subsequence of [formula] and g∈P  ⊆  U.

Subcase 2.2. The sequence [formula] does not contain any subsequence which is contained in X.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula], since [formula] is clopen in F3(X). Similar to the proof of Case 1, let

[formula]

Then Z3 is sequentially compact. For each [formula], pick a point [formula]. Then [formula] has a subsequence [formula] converging to z = (z1,z2,z3) for some z∈Z3. Since g is assumed to be non-isolated in [formula], we have

[formula]

Moreover, since xn  ≠  xm for any n  ≠  m, the sequence [formula] is a non-trivial sequence. Hence, we have z∈i- 13(g), [formula] for each i∈{1,2,3}, z1 = g or z3 = g, and [formula]. Then z∈{(g,z2,z- 12),(z- 12,z2,g)}. Without loss of generality, we assume that z1 = g,z2∈X' and z = (g,z2,z- 12). Pick open neighborhoods V1,V2 of g and z2 in X, respectively, such that V1  ×  V2  ×  V- 12  ⊆  i- 13(U). Since [formula] is a cs*-network for X' in X, it is easy to see that there exist [formula] such that g∈P1  ⊆  V1, z2∈P2  ⊆  V2, z- 12∈P- 13  ⊆  V- 12 and z∈P1  ×  P2  ×  P- 13 contains a subsequence of [formula]. Hence, g∈P1P2P- 13  ⊆  V1V2V- 12  ⊆  U and P1P2P- 13 contains a subsequence of [formula].

Case 3: g = e.

In this case, let

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]. We verify that [formula] is a cs*-network for F3(X) at e. Take an arbitrary sequence [formula] converging to e and an open neighborhood U of e in F3(X). Without loss of generality, we assume that [formula] is a non-trivial convergent sequence such that xn  ≠  xm whenever n  ≠  m. Since [formula] is clopen in F3(X), we assume that

[formula]

By an argument similar to that in Case 2, we can show that there exist [formula] such that e∈Pε11Pε22  ⊆  U and Pε11Pε22 contains a subsequence of [formula].

As shown by the following result, for the Abelian case, the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:level3_csf] can be strengthened significantly.

Let X is be a sequential and μ-space. If X' has a countable cs*-network in X, then A(X) is csf-countable.

Since A(X) is a topological group, we only need to prove that A(X) has a countable cs-network at 0. Let [formula] be a countable cs*-network for X' and

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]. Next, we verify that [formula] is a cs*-network for A(X) at 0.

Take an arbitrary sequence [formula] converging to 0 in A(X) and an arbitrary open neighborhood U of 0 in A(X). Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula] is a non-trivial convergent sequence. Further, we may assume that xn  ≠  xm for any n  ≠  m. Obviously, we have [formula] for some [formula]. Then there exists some m  ≤  l such that [formula] contains a subsequence of [formula]. Therefore, we may assume that [formula] is contained in [formula]. Let

[formula]

By the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:level3_csf], Zm is sequentially compact. For each [formula], pick a point [formula]. Then [formula] has a subsequence [formula] converging to z = (z1,z2,...zm) for some z∈Zm. Obviously, z∈i- 1m(0) and [formula] for each j  ≤  m. Pick an open subset Vj in [formula] for each j  ≤  m such that

[formula]

For each [formula], choose a [formula] inductively such that zj∈εjPj  ⊆  Vj, εjPj contains a subsequence [formula] of [formula] and [formula] is a subsequence of [formula], where each εj  =  1 or - 1. Let

[formula]

Then 0∈B  ⊆  U, which verifies that [formula] is a cs*-network at 0. By Lemma [\ref=lcs], A(X) is csf-countable.

For a Lanev space X, if G2(X) is csf-countable, then so is G3(X).

Since X is a Lanev space, it is sequential. By a proof analogous to that of the implication (ii) ⇒   (iii) in Theorem [\ref=thm:level2_csf], one can show that X' is a separable subspace of X. Hence it follows from [\cite=JY] that X is a paracompact [formula]-space, since G2(X) is csf-countable and X is a Lanev space. Since X' is closed and separable in X, X' is Lindelöf, which shows that X' is an [formula]-subspace in X. Hence X' has a countable [formula]-network in X. Therefore, F3(X) and A3(X) are csf-countable by Theorems [\ref=thm:level3_csf] and [\ref=thm:abelian_csf], respectively.

(i) Let [formula], where D is an uncountable discrete space and K is a compact metric space. Then A(X) is csf-countable. However, F3(X) and each An(X) are first-countable by Theorem 4.5 and Theorem 4.12 in [\cite=Y1998], and F4(X) is not csf-countable by Corollary [\ref=cor:level4_csf].

(ii) In general, the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm:level3_csf] or Theorem [\ref=thm:abelian_csf] does not hold. Indeed, let X be an uncountable pseudocompact topological group containing no nontrivial convergent sequences, as given in [\cite=Si1969]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:non_trivial_cs], G(X) is snf-countable, and hence G(X) is csf-countable. Since X is an uncountable pseudocompact topological group, X' is uncountable. Then X' must not have a countable cs*-network in X. Indeed, assume on the contrary that X' has a countable cs*-network in X. Then X' = X is an [formula]-space, hence it is submetrizable. Since a pseudocompact submetrizable space is metrizable, it follows that X is metrizable, which is a contradiction with the assumption.

Open Questions

We conclude this paper by posing some open questions. Our first open question concerns about the Abelian case of Theorem [\ref=thm:subspacefree]. Theorem [\ref=thm:subspacefree] establishes relationships among the snf-countability and the metrizability of F4(X) and each Fn(X), as well as some properties of X for a fairly large class of topological spaces. It is nice to know whether a similar result on A4(X) and An(X) holds for the same class of spaces. Thus, the following question is of interests.

Let X be a k-space with a regular Gδ-diagonal. If A4(X) is snf-countable, must every An(X) be snf-countable?

In the light of Theorem 4.5 and Theorem 4.12 in [\cite=Y1998], Theorem [\ref=thm:subspacefree] and Theorem [\ref=thm:level4_csf], it is natural to pose the following two questions.

Let X be a k-space with a regular Gδ-diagonal. If G2(X) is snf-countable, must G3(X) be snf-countable?

Let X be a non-discrete Lanev space. If A4(X) is csf-countable, must each An(X) be csf-countable?

Note that the answers to Question [\ref=ques:g2_to_g3] and Question [\ref=ques:level4_abelian] are not known even when X is a metrizable space. Our last open question concerns about how to characterize the csf-countability of F(X) and A(X) in term of properties of X.

Let X be a space. Is there a topological property [formula] of X which characterizes the csf-countability of F(X) or A(X)?
