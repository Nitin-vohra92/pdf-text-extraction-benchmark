Abstract

We were invited by the Organizing Committee of the Mathematical Conference dedicated to Professor Ivan Prodanov on the occasion of the 60-th anniversary of his birth and the 10-th anniversary of his death, held on May 16, 1995 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of the Sofia University ``St. Kliment Ohridski", to give a talk on his investigations in the theory of abstract spectra. All of his results in this area were announced by him in a short paper published in [\cite=P1] and, as far as we know, their proofs were never written by him in the form of a manuscript, preprint or paper. The very incomplete notes which we have from Prodanov's talks on the Seminar on Spectra, organized by him in 1979/80 academic year at the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Sofia, seem to be the only trace of a small part of the proofs of some of the results from the cited above paper. Since the untimely death of Ivan Prodanov withheld him from preparing the full version of this paper and since, in our opinion, it contains interesting and important results, we undertook the task of writing a full version of it and thus making the results from it known to the mathematical community. So, the aim of this paper is to supply with proofs the results of Ivan Prodanov announced in the cited above paper, but we added also a small amount of new results. The main of them is Theorem [\ref=th66] which was formulated and proved by us as a generalization of Prodanov's assertions Corollary [\ref=th6] and Corollary [\ref=th7].

The full responsibility for the correctness of the proofs of the assertions presented below in this work is taken by us; just for this reason our names appear as authors of the present paper. The talks of the participants of the conference had to be published at a special volume of the Annuaire de l�Universite de Sofia ``St. Kliment Ohridski�, but this never happened. That is why we have decided to publish our work separately. Since our files were lost and we had to write them once more, the paper appears only now.

Introduction

This paper contains an extended version of the invited talk given by the authors at the Mathematical Conference dedicated to Professor Ivan Prodanov on the occasion of the 60[formula] anniversary of his birth and the 10[formula] anniversary of his death. The conference took place on May 16, 1995 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of the Sofia University ``St. Kliment Ohridski". It was planned the talks of the participants in this conference to be published in a special volume of the Annuaire de l�Universite de Sofia ``St. Kliment Ohridski�, Faculte de Mathematiques et Informatique, Livre 1 - Mathematiques, but this has never happened. That's why we have decided to publish our work separately. Since our files were lost and we had to write them once more, the paper appears only now.

In 1979/80 academic year, Professor Ivan Prodanov organized a seminar on spectra at the Faculty of Mathematics of Sofia University. The participants in this seminar, besides Iv. Prodanov, were G. Dimov, G. Gargov, Sv. Savchev, L. Stoyanov, V. Tchoukanov, T. Tinchev, D. Vakarelov. The talks of Iv. Prodanov on this seminar were on his own investigations in the theory of abstract spectra and the uniqueness of Pontryagin-van Kampen duality. In the reviewing talks of the other participants, Stone Duality Theorems for Boolean algebras and for distributive lattices ([\cite=Sto1] [\cite=Sto2]), H. A. Priestley's papers [\cite=Pr1] [\cite=Pr2] [\cite=Pr3] [\cite=Pr4], M. Hochster papers [\cite=H1] [\cite=H2], the topological proof of Gödel Completeness Theorem given by Rasiowa and Sikorski in [\cite=RS] and many other interesting topics were discussed.

Iv. Prodanov raised a number of interesting open problems on his seminar on spectra. Two of them were solved by some of the participants of the seminar and these solutions caused, on their part, the appearence of other new papers. One of these problems was whether the category LR of locally compact topological R-modules, where R is a locally compact commutative ring, admits precisely one (up to natural equivalence) functorial duality. (Using the classical Pontryagin-van Kampen duality, one easily obtains a functorial duality in LR, called again Pontryagin duality. Hence, there is always a functorial duality in LR.) L. Stoyanov [\cite=St] showed that if R is a compact commutative ring then the Pontryagin duality is the unique functorial duality in LR. Later on, Gregorio [\cite=Gre] and Gregorio and Orsatti [\cite=GrOr94] generalized that result of Stoyanov. The second problem was whether a uniqueness theorem, like that for Pontryagin-van Kampen duality, can be proved in the cases of Stone dualities for Boolean algebras and for distributive lattices. The answers were given by G. Dimov in [\cite=D1] and [\cite=D2], where it was proved that the Stone duality for Boolean algebras is unique and that there are only two (up to natural equivalence) duality functors in the case of distributive lattices. Some very general results about representable dualities and the group of dualities were obtained later on by G. Dimov and W. Tholen in [\cite=DT1] [\cite=DT2]. It could be said that D. Vakarelov's paper [\cite=V1] was also inspired by Prodanov's seminar on spectra. This was certainly so for the diploma thesis [\cite=Sav1] of Sv. Savchev, written under the supervision of Professor Iv. Prodanov, and for the paper [\cite=Sav2].

Iv. Prodanov presented his results on the uniqueness of Pontryagin-van Kampen duality in the manuscripts [\cite=P2] and [\cite=P3]. The more than fifty-pages-long paper [\cite=P3] contained also an impressive list of open problems and conjectures. The publication of these manuscripts was postponed because Prodanov discovered that analogous results were obtained earlier by D. Roeder [\cite=R]. Prodanov's approach, however, was different and even more general than that of D. Roeder. Only his untimely death withheld him from preparing these manuscripts for publication. The task of doing that was carried out by D. Dikranjan and A. Orsatti. In their paper [\cite=DO], all results of [\cite=P2] and [\cite=P3] were included and some of Prodanov's conjectures were answered. In such a way the manuscripts [\cite=P2] and [\cite=P3] became known to the mathematical community and stimulated the appearance of other papers (see [\cite=Dik94], [\cite=Greg89]).

The results of Iv. Prodanov on abstract spectra and separative algebras were announced in [\cite=P1], but their proofs were never written by him in the form of a manuscript, preprint or paper. The very incomplete notes which we have from the Prodanov talks on the seminar on spectra seem to be the only trace of a small part of these proofs. Since, in our opinion, the results, announced in [\cite=P1], are interesting and important, we decided to supply them with proofs. This is done in the present paper, where we follow, in general, the exposition of [\cite=P1], but some of the announced there assertions are slightly generalized, some new statements are added and some new applications are obtained. The main of the added results is Theorem [\ref=th66] which was formulated and proved by us as a generalization of Prodanov's assertions Corollary [\ref=th6] and Corollary [\ref=th7].

Section 1 of the paper is an introduction. Section 2, divided into four subsections, is devoted to the abstract spectra. In Subsection 2.1 the category S of abstract spectra and their morphisms is introduced and studied. Subsection 2.2 contains two general examples of abstract spectra (see [\ref=th2] and [\ref=th4]). The classical spectra of rings endowed with Zariski topology appear as special cases of the first of these examples (see [\ref=ex1]), while the classical spectra of distributive lattices with their Stone topology appear as special cases of both examples (see [\ref=ex2] and [\ref=ex20]). In Subsection 2.3 the main theorem of Section 2 is proved (see [\ref=th5]). This theorem asserts that the category S of abstract spectra and their morphisms is isomorphic to the category CohSp of coherent spaces and coherent maps and, hence, by the Stone Duality Theorem for distributive lattices, the category S is dual to the category DLat of distributive lattices and lattice homomorphisms. It is well known that the category OStone of ordered Stone spaces and order-preserving continuous maps is also dual to the category DLat (see [\cite=Pr1] [\cite=Pr2] or [\cite=J]), and that it is isomorphic to the category CohSp (see, for example, [\cite=J]). Therefore, the category OStone is isomorphic to the category S. (The last fact could be also proved directly, but we don't do this.) So, each one of the categories CohSp, OStone and S is dual to the category DLat. In our opinion, the category S is the most natural and symmetrical one from all three of them. Subsection 2.4 contains two applications (see Corollary [\ref=th6] and Corollary [\ref=th7]) of the already obtained results. The one from Corollary [\ref=th6] is important for Section 3. These applications appear as special cases of a general theorem (see Theorem [\ref=th66]) which we formulate and prove here as a generalization of Prodanov's results Corollary [\ref=th6] and Corollary [\ref=th7]. Theorem [\ref=th66] was used later on by us in our paper [\cite=DV].

At the first glance the advent of spectra in so general situations as in [\ref=th2] is unexpected, since psychologically they usually are connected with separation. Actually, in general one does not know whether there are nontrivial prime ideals but it turns out that if the operations ×   and +   from [\ref=th2] satisfy a few not very restrictive natural conditions, then the prime ideals become as many as in the commutative rings or in distributive lattices, for example. In this way one comes to the notion of a separative algebra considered in Section 3.

Section 3 is divided into several subsections. In Subsection 3.1 the definition of a preseparative algebra as an algebra with two multivalued binary operations ×   and +   satisfying some natural axioms as commutativity and associativity is given, and some calculus with this operations is developed. Subsection 3.2 is devoted to the theory of filters and ideals in preseparative algebras. The main notion of a separative algebra is given in Subsection 3.3. Here a far of being complete list of examples is given: the commutative rings, the distributive lattices and also the convex spaces (= separative algebras in which the two operations coincide) are separative algebras. The main theorem for separative algebras - the Separation theorem, is proved in Subsection 3.4. In Subsection 3.5 some natural new operations in separative algebras are studied and in Subsection 3.6 a general representation theorem for separative algebras is given. Roughly speaking, every separative algebra  = (X,  ×  , + ) can be embedded into a distributive lattice L in such a way that the operations in [formula] are obtained easily from the operations in L. That is new even for the plane: there exists a distributive lattice L  ⊇  2 such that for each segment ab  ⊂  2 one has

[formula]

The notion of separative algebra comes from an analysis of the separation theorems connected with the convexity. The abstract study of convexity was started by Prenovitz [\cite=Pr] and different versions of the notion of convex space appeared in [\cite=P4], [\cite=P5], [\cite=T], [\cite=Br], [\cite=BrW], [\cite=PrJ]. All they are compared in [\cite=Tes]. The convexity was examined from other aspects in [\cite=B], [\cite=Can], [\cite=Gua], [\cite=Kay] and [\cite=Mah], a few applications are considered in [\cite=Zim] and [\cite=BS] contains a critique.

Y. Tagamlitzki [\cite=T] obtained a general Separation theorem for convex spaces. It was improved (again for convex spaces) and applied to analytical separation problems in [\cite=P4] and [\cite=P5] (cf. [\cite=B] and [\cite=BrW]). It seems however that the natural region for that theorem are not the convex spaces but the separative algebras: the presence of two operations makes the instrument more flexible, without additional complications (see Subsection 3.4). This permits to obtain as special cases the separation by prime ideals of an ideal and a multiplicative set in a commutative ring, or of an ideal and a filter in a distributive lattice, and also the separation of two convex sets by a convex set with convex complement.

The paper ends with Subsection 3.8 devoted to a generalization of the Separation theorem for separative algebras supplied with a topology. Thus, even restricted to convex spaces, one can find, as in [\cite=P5], a few classical separation and representation theorems, but the presence of two operations enlarges the possibilities for new applications.

Let's fix the notation. If C denotes a category, we write X∈|C| if X is an object of C, and f∈C(X,Y) if f is a C-morphism with domain X and codomain Y. All lattices will be with top (=unit) and bottom (=zero) elements, denoted respectively by 1 and 0. We don't require the elements 0 and 1 to be distinct. As usual, the lattice homomorphisms are assumed to preserve the distinguished elements 0 and 1. DLat will stand for the category of distributive lattices and lattice homomorphisms. If X is a set then we write Exp(X) for the set of all subsets of X and denote by |X| the cardinality of X. If (X,T) is a topological space and A is a subset of X then cl(X,T)A or, simply, clXA stands for the closure of A in the space (X,T). We denote by D the two-point discrete topological space and by Set the category of all sets and functions between them. As usual, we say that a preordered set (X,  ≤  ) (i.e. ≤   is a reflexive and transitive binary relation on X) is a directed set (resp. an ordered set) if for any x,y∈X there exists a z∈X such that x  ≤  z and y  ≤  z (resp. if the relation ≤   is also antisymmetric).

Spectra

The Category of Abstract Spectra

It is obvious.

By (SP3), one of the spaces (S,T+) and (S,T-) is T0-space. Let, for example, (S,T+) be a T0-space. Then we shall prove that (S,T-) is also a T0-space.

Let x,y∈S and [formula]. Then there exists U∈T+ such that [formula]. Let, for example, x∈U. Then, using (SP1), we can find a V∈L+ such that x∈V  ⊆  U. Putting [formula], we obtain that W∈T-, y∈W and [formula]. Therefore, (S,T-) is a T0-space.

Since S is a closed subset of (S,T+), the condition (SP2) implies that S is a compact subset of (S,T-).

Analogously, we obtain that (S,T+) is a compact space.

Let us prove first that L+  =  {U∈T+:U is a compact subset of (S,T+)}.

If V∈L+ then [formula]. Hence V is a closed subset of (S,T-). This implies, by (SP2), that V is a compact subset of (S,T+). Conversely, if U∈T+ and U is a compact subset of (S,T+) then for every x∈U there exists a Ux∈L+ such that x∈Ux  ⊆  U. Choose a finite subcover [formula] of the cover {Ux:x∈U} of the compact set U. Then [formula] and hence, by [\ref=pr0], U∈L+.

The proof of the equation L-  =  {U∈T-:U is a compact subset of (S,T-)} is analogous.

Let's prove that [formula].

Take V∈L- and put [formula]. Then U∈T+ and [formula]. Hence, U∈L+ and [formula]. Conversely, if U∈L+ then [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

The proof of the equation [formula] is analogous.

Let (S,T+,T-1) and (S,T+,T-2) be abstract spectra. Then the topologies T-1 and T-2 coincide.

It follows directly from [\ref=pr2], [\ref=pr3] and (SP1) (see [\ref=de1]).

(  ⇒  ) Let (S,T,T) be a Stone spectrum. Then, by [\ref=pr1], (S,T) is a compact T0-space. According to (SP1) (see [\ref=de1]), the family [formula] is a base for T. Consequently (S,T) is a zero-dimensional space. We shall show that it is also a T2-space. Indeed, let x,y∈S and [formula]. Then there exists a U∈T such that [formula]. Let, for example, x∈U. Since L+ is a base for T, we can find a V∈L+ such that x∈V  ⊆  U. Then x∈V∈T and [formula]. Therefore, (S,T) is a T2-space. So, we proved that (S,T) is a compact zero-dimensional T2-space, i.e. a Stone space.

(⇐) Let (S,T) be a Stone space. Put [formula] and T+  =  T-  =  T. Then L+  =  L  =  L- (see [\ref=no1] for the notation). We shall prove that (S,T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum. Then it will be automatically a Stone spectrum. Since L is a base for (S,T), the axiom (SP1) (see [\ref=de1]) is fulfilled. The axioms (SP2) and (SP3) are also fulfilled, since (S,T) is a compact T2-space. Consequently (S,T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum.

(  ⇒  ) Since (S,T+,T-) is a Stone spectrum, we have that T+  =  T-. Then [\ref=pr4] implies that (S,T+) and (S,T-) are even T2-spaces.

(⇐) Let (S,T+) and (S,T-) are T1-spaces. We shall prove that T+  =  T-.

Let U∈T-. Then [formula] is closed in (S,T-) and hence, by [\ref=pr1], it is a compact subset of (S,T-). Let x∈U. Since (S,T+) is a T1-space, for every [formula] there exists a Vy∈L+ such that [formula]. Hence [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be a finite subcover of the cover [formula] of [formula] and let [formula]. Then x∈Vx∈T+ and Vx  ⊆  U. We obtain that [formula]. Hence T-  ⊆  T+. Analogously, using the fact that (S,T-) is a T1-space, we prove that T+  ⊆  T-. Therefore T+  =  T-, i.e. (S,T-,T+) is a Stone spectrum.

Let (S,T+,T-) be an abstract spectrum. Then, arguing as in [\ref=pr1], we obtain that (S,T+) and (S,T-) are T1-spaces iff at least one of them is a T1-space.

The topology T has as a subbase the family [formula]. Hence the family [formula] is a base for T. Then, obviously, the family [formula] is also a base for T. For every U∈L+ we have that U∈T+  ⊆  T and [formula]. Consequently the elements of L+ are clopen subsets of (S,T). Obviously, the same is true for the elements of L-. Hence the elements of B0 are clopen in (S,T), which implies that (S,T) is a zero-dimensional space. This fact, together with (SP3) (see [\ref=de1]), shows that (S,T) is a Hausdorff space.

Applying Alexander subbase theorem to the subbase P of (S,T), we shall prove that (S,T) is a compact space. Indeed, let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and F is closed in (S,T+). Consequently, by (SP2) (see [\ref=de1]), F is a compact subset of (S,T-). This implies that there exist [formula] such that [formula]. Then [formula]. Since G is a closed subset of (S,T-), it is a compact subset of (S,T+) (by (SP2)). Hence, there exist [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. This shows that (S,T) is compact. Hence, (S,T) is a Stone space.

Let (S,T+,T-) be an abstract spectrum and id:S  →  S, x  →  x, be the identity function. Then, obviously, id∈((S,T,T),(S,T+,T-)) (see [\ref=pr6] for the notation).

(  ⇒  ) Let T1  =   sup {T+1,T-1}. Then, by [\ref=pr6], (S1,T1) is a Stone space. Hence it is a compact Hausdorff space. Since, obviously, T1  =  T|S1, we obtain that S1 is a compact subspace of the Hausdorff space (S,T). Consequently S1 is a closed subset of (S,T).

(⇐) We shall show that (S1,T+1,T-1) is an abstract spectrum. Let [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then, obviously, L+1  ⊆  L+S1 and L-1  ⊆  L-S1. Since L+1 (resp. L-1) is a base for (S1,T+1) (resp. (S1,T-1)), we obtain that L+S1 (resp. L-S1) is a base for (S1,T+1) (resp. (S1,T-1)). Hence the condition (SP1) (see [\ref=de1]) is fulfilled.

In the part (  ⇒  ) of this proof, we noted that the topology T1  =   sup {T+1,T-1} on S1 coincides with the topology T|S1. Hence, (S1,T1) is a compact Hausdorff space (since (S,T) is such and S1 is a closed subset of (S,T)). Let now F be a closed subset of (S1,T+1) (resp. (S1,T-1)). Then F is a closed subset of (S1,T1). Therefore F is a compact subset of (S1,T1). Since the identity maps id:(S1,T1)  →  (S1,T+1) and id:(S1,T1)  →  (S1,T-1) are continuous, we obtain that F is a compact subset of (S1,T-1) (resp. (S1,T+1)). Hence, the condition (SP2) (see [\ref=de1]) is fulfilled.

For showing that the condition (SP3) (see [\ref=de1]) is fulfilled, it is enough to prove that (S1,T+1) is a T0-space. Let x,y∈S1 and [formula]. Since (S1,T1) is a T2-space, there exist U∈L+1 and V∈L-1 such that [formula]. If [formula] then the element U of T+1 separates x and y. If y∈U then [formula]. Hence [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], we obtain that x and y are separated by an element of T+1. Consequently, (S1,T+1) is a T0-space.

Let (S,T+,T-) be an abstract spectrum, T  =   sup {T+,T-}, S1  ⊆  S, [formula] and [formula]. Then the bitopological space (S1,T+1,T-1) is an abstract spectrum iff S1 is a closed subset of the topological space (S,T).

It follows immediately from [\ref=pr61], [\ref=de1] and [\ref=pr6].

Examples of Abstract Spectra

Let [formula]. Then [formula] is a subbase for the topology [formula] on Exp(X). For every x∈X we have, identifying Exp(X) and X by means of the map e, that Ũ+x  =  {f∈X:f(x) = 0} and Ũ-x  =  {f∈X:f(x) = 1}. Now it becomes clear that the family [formula] is also a subbase for the Tychonoff topology on X when [formula] is endowed with the discrete topology. Therefore the topology [formula] on Exp(X) coincides with the Tychonoff topology on X.

(a)  ⇒  (b). This follows from [\ref=pr6].

(b)  ⇒  (a). Let x∈X. Then [formula] and [formula]. Hence P+  ⊆  L+ and P-  ⊆  L- (see [\ref=no1] for the notation). Consequently, using [\ref=pr0], we obtain that L+ (resp. L-) is a base for (S,T+) (resp. (S,T-)). This shows that putting S1 = S in [\ref=pr61], we get that (S,T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum.

(b)  ⇒  (c). It is clear from the corresponding definitions that, using the notation of [\ref=lm20], we have [formula] and [formula] for every x∈X. Hence, by [\ref=lm20], the topology T on S coincides with the subspace topology on S induced by the Tychonoff topology on X. Then the condition (b) and the fact that X is a Hausdorff space imply that S is a closed subset of the Cantor cube X.

(c)  ⇒  (b). In the preceding paragraph we have already noted that the topology T on S coincides with the subspace topology on S induced by the Tychonoff topology on X. Therefore the condition (c) implies that (S,T) is a compact Hausdorff space (since X is such).

Let X be a set endowed with two arbitrary multivalued binary operations [formula] and [formula] and two fixed different points ξo and ξ1. Denote by S(X) (resp. S(X)pr) the set of all (resp. all proper) prime ideals in [formula] and define the topologies T+ and T- on S(X) (resp. T+pr and T-pr on S(X)pr) exactly as in [\ref=th1]. Then the bitopological spaces (S(X),T+,T-) and (S(X)pr,T+pr,T-pr) are abstract spectra.

We first prove that the bitopological space (S(X),T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum. For doing this it is enough to show that S(X) is a closed subset of the Cantor cube X (see [\ref=th1]).

Let [formula] be a net in the Cantor cube X converging to a point p∈X. We have to prove that p∈S(X), i.e. that p is a prime ideal in [formula]. Let [formula] and f = e(p) (see [\ref=lm20] for the notation). Then the net [formula] in X converges to f, i.e., for every x∈X, the net [formula] in the discrete space [formula] converges to f(x).

Let a,b∈p. Then f(a) = f(b) = 1. Therefore there exists a σ0∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  >  σ0. This means that for every σ  >  σ0 we have that [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] is a prime ideal, we obtain that [formula] for every σ  >  σ0. Then, for every [formula] and for every σ  >  σ0, we have that [formula]. This implies that f(x) = 1 for every [formula]. Hence, if [formula] then x∈p, i.e. [formula].

Let a,b∈X and [formula]. Then there exists a [formula]. Hence f(x) = 1. This implies that there exists a σ0∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  >  σ0. Consequently [formula] for every σ  >  σ0. Then [formula] for every σ  >  σ0. Hence, for every σ  >  σ0, we have that [formula] or [formula], i.e. [formula] or [formula]. Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Then f(a) = 0 = f(b). Therefore, there exists a σ1∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  >  σ1. Since for every σ  >   sup {σ0,σ1} we have that [formula] or [formula], we get a contradiction. Hence we obtain that a∈p or b∈p. So, we proved that p is a prime ideal in [formula]. This shows that S(X) is a closed subset of the Cantor cube X. Hence, the bitopological space (S(X),T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum.

If the prime ideals [formula] in the above proof were proper, then, obviously, p would be also proper. This shows that the set S(X)pr is also a closed subset of the Cantor cube X. So, the bitopological space (S(X)pr,T+pr,T-pr) is an abstract spectrum.

Let (A, + ,.) be a commutative ring with unit [formula], [formula] be the ideal in the ring (A, + ,.) generated by {x,y}, and [formula], for every x,y∈A. Then, applying the construction from [\ref=th2] to the set A with the operations [formula] and [formula] and with fixed points 0 and 1, we get the topological space (S(A)pr,T+pr). We assert that it coincides with the classical spectrum of the ring (A, + ,.).

Recall that: a) a subgroup I of the additive group (A, + ) is called an ideal in the commutative ring (A, + ,.) with unit if A.I = I; b) an ideal [formula] in the ring A is said to be a prime ideal if (x,y∈A, x.y∈p)  ⇒   (x∈p or y∈p); c) the set of all prime ideals in the commutative ring A is denoted by spec(A); d) the family [formula] is an ideal in A} is a topology on the set spec(A), called Zariski topology; e) the topological space (spec(A),Z) is the classical spectrum of the commutative ring (A, + ,.) with unit.

We shall denote by I(M) the ideal in A generated by a subset M of A.

We first prove that the sets spec(A) and S(A)pr coincide.

Let p∈S(A)pr. Then [formula] and hence [formula]. If a,b∈p then [formula], i.e. I({a,b})  ⊆  p. Hence, a - b∈p. This shows that p is an additive subgroup of A. Let x∈A and a∈p. Since [formula], we get that x.a∈p. If x,y∈A and x.y∈p, then [formula] and, hence, x∈p or y∈p. Consequently, we proved that p∈spec(A).

Conversely, let p∈spec(A) and a,b∈p. Then, obviously, I({a,b})  ⊆  p and, hence, [formula]. If [formula] then a.b∈p. This implies that a∈p or b∈p. Since [formula], we get that p∈S(A)pr. Therefore, S(A)pr = spec(A).

Now we prove that T+pr  =  Z.

Let a∈A. Then, obviously, [formula]. Hence, T+pr  ⊆  Z. Conversely, let U∈Z. Then there exists an ideal I in A such that U = UI. Let p∈U. Then there exists an [formula]. Hence p∈U+a. We shall prove that U+a  ⊆  U. Indeed, if q∈U+a then [formula] and, consequently, [formula]. This shows that q∈UI = U. So, we obtained that p∈U+a  ⊆  U. Therefore, Z  ⊆  T+pr.

Let [formula] be a distributive lattice with 0 and 1 and let us put [formula] and [formula], for every x,y∈L. Then, applying the construction from [\ref=th2] to the set L with the operations [formula] and [formula] and with fixed points 0 and 1, we get the topological space (S(L)pr,T+pr). We assert that it coincides with the classical spectrum spec(L) of the distributive lattice [formula].

Recall that: a) a sub-join-semillatice I of the lattice L is said to be an ideal in L if (a∈I, b∈L and b  ≤  a)  ⇒  (b∈I); b) an ideal p in L is called a prime ideal if [formula] and [formula] (a∈p or b∈p); c) the set of all prime ideals in L is denoted by spec(L); d) the family [formula] is an ideal in L} is a topology on the set spec(L), called Stone topology; e) the topological space (spec(L),O) is the classical spectrum of the lattice [formula].

We first prove that the sets spec(L) and S(L)pr coincide.

Let p∈S(L)pr. Then 0∈p and [formula]. If a,b∈p then [formula] and, hence, [formula]. Let c∈L, a∈p and c  ≤  a. Since a∈p, we have that [formula] and, consequently, c∈p. If c,d∈L and [formula] then [formula]. Therefore c∈p or d∈p. So, p∈spec(L).

Let p∈spec(L) and a,b∈p. Then [formula] and, for all c∈L such that [formula], we have that c∈p. Hence [formula]. Let x,y∈p and [formula]. Then there exists a z∈p such that [formula]. Hence [formula]. This implies that x∈p or y∈p. Since [formula], we obtain that p∈S(L)pr. So, S(L)pr = spec(L).

Now we prove that T+pr  =  O.

Let a∈L and I(a) = {x∈L:x  ≤  a}. Then I(a) is an ideal in L. Obviously, [formula]. Hence T+pr  ⊆  O. Conversely, let U∈O. Then there exists an ideal I in L such that U = UI. Let p∈U. Then there exists an [formula]. Hence p∈U+a and we need to prove only that U+a  ⊆  U. Let q∈U+a. Then [formula]. Consequently [formula], which means that q∈UI = U. So, p∈U+a  ⊆  U. We obtained that O  ⊆  T+pr.

Let X be a set endowed with two arbitrary single-valued binary operations +   and ×   and two fixed different points ξo∈X and ξ1∈X. Denote by S'(X) (resp. S'(X)pr) the set of all (proper) l-prime ideals in (X, + ,  ×  ) and define the topologies T+ and T- on S'(X) (resp. T+pr and T-pr on S'(X)pr) exactly as in [\ref=th1]. Then the bitopological spaces (S'(X),T+,T-) and (S'(X)pr,T+pr,T-pr) are abstract spectra.

We first prove that the bitopological space (S'(X),T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum. For doing this it is enough to show that S'(X) is a closed subset of the Cantor cube X (see [\ref=th1]).

Let [formula] be a net in the Cantor cube X converging to a point p∈X. We have to prove that p∈S'(X), i.e. that p is an l-prime ideal in (X, + ,  ×  ).

Exactly as in the proof of [\ref=th2], we show that a,b∈p implies that a + b∈p and that if a  ×  b∈p then a∈p or b∈p.

Let [formula] and f = e(p) (see [\ref=lm20] for the notation). Then the net [formula] in X converges to f, i.e., for every x∈X, the net [formula] in the discrete space [formula] converges to f(x).

Let a,b∈X and a + b∈p. Then f(a + b) = 1. Hence there exists a σ0∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  ≥  σ0. Consequently, for every σ  ≥  σ0, we have that [formula]. Then, for every σ  ≥  σ0, we get that [formula] and [formula], i.e. [formula] and [formula]. This implies that f(a) = 1 and f(b) = 1, i.e. a∈p and b∈p.

Let a,b∈X be such that a∈p or b∈p. Suppose that [formula]. Then f(a  ×  b) = 0. Hence there exists a σ0∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  ≥  σ0. This means that for every σ  ≥  σ0, we have that [formula]. Consequently, [formula] and [formula] for every σ  ≥  σ0. We obtain that [formula] and [formula] for every σ  ≥  σ0. This implies that f(a) = 0 and f(b) = 0, i.e. [formula] and [formula], which is a contradiction. Therefore, a  ×  b∈p. Hence, p is an l-prime ideal in (X, + ,  ×  ). This shows that S'(X) is a closed subset of the Cantor cube X. Hence, the bitopological space (S'(X),T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum.

If the prime ideals [formula] in the above proof were proper, then, obviously, p would be also proper. This shows that the set S'(X)pr is also a closed subset of the Cantor cube X. So, the bitopological space (S'(X)pr,T+pr,T-pr) is an abstract spectrum.

Let [formula] be a distributive lattice with 0 and 1 and let us put [formula] and [formula], for every x,y∈L. Then, applying the construction from [\ref=th4] to the set L with the operations +   and ×   and with fixed points 0 and 1, we get the topological space (S'(L)pr,T+pr). We assert that it coincides with the classical spectrum spec(L) of the distributive lattice [formula].

We first prove that the sets spec(L) and S'(L)pr coincide.

Let p∈S'(L)pr. Then 0∈p and [formula]. If a,b∈p then a  +  b∈p and, hence, [formula]. Let c∈L, a∈p and c  ≤  a. Then [formula], i.e. c  +  a∈p. Thus c∈p. If c,d∈L and [formula] then c  ×  d∈p. Therefore c∈p or d∈p. So, p∈spec(L).

Let p∈spec(L). If a,b∈p then [formula], i.e. a  +  b∈p. Further, if x,y∈L and x  +  y∈p, then [formula] and [formula], [formula]. Hence x∈p and y∈p. So, x + y∈p iff x∈p and y∈p. Now, let a∈p or b∈p. Then [formula] and [formula]. Therefore [formula], i.e. a  ×  b∈p. Finally, if x,y∈L and x  ×  y∈p then [formula] and, hence, x∈p or y∈p. So, x  ×  y∈p iff x∈p or y∈p. Since 0∈p and [formula], we obtain that p∈S'(L)pr. Therefore, we proved that S'(L)pr = spec(L).

The proof of the equality T+pr  =  O is analogous to the proof of the corresponding statement about S(L)pr, given in the proof of [\ref=ex2].

The Main Theorem

The main theorem of Section 2 - Theorem {[\ref=th5] below - will be proved here. For doing this we need some preliminary definitions and results.

(a) The relation ≤   defined in [\ref=de6] is a partial order on S since (S,T-) is a T0-space (see [\ref=pr1]) and, as it is well known, the specialization is a partial order on every T0-space.

(b) It is obvious that a  ≤  b iff a∈cl(S,T-){b} iff b∈cl(S,T+){a} iff cl(S,T+){b}  ⊆  cl(S,T+){a}.

(c) It is easy to see that if a∈S then cl(S,T+){a}  =  {b∈S:b  ≥  a} and cl(S,T-){a}  =  {b∈S:b  ≤  a}.

(d) If the elements of an abstract spectrum S are prime (or l-prime) ideals defined as in Section 2.2 (i.e. S = S(X), where X is a set with two binary operations), then a  ≤  b iff a  ⊆  b, for a,b∈S.

Let U∈L+ and b∈U. Then there exists a σ0∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  ≥  σ0. Suppose that [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. Hence there exists a σ1∈Σ such that [formula] for every σ  ≥  σ1. Putting σ' =  sup {σ0,σ1}, we obtain that bσ'∈U and [formula]. Therefore [formula], i.e. [formula] - a contradiction. Hence a∈U. This shows that b∈cl(S,T+){a}, i.e. a  ≤  b.

Since (A,  ≤  ) is a directed set and A  ⊆  S, {a,a∈A} is a net in the compact Hausdorff space (S,T) (where T  =   sup {T+,T-}) (see [\ref=pr6]) and, hence, it has a cluster point b∈S. We shall prove that b =  sup {a:a∈A} in (S,  ≤  ). Indeed, let U∈T+ and b∈U. Then U∈T and for every a∈A there exists an a'∈A such that a'  ≥  a and a'∈U. Hence A  ⊆  U. This shows that b∈cl(S,T+){a} for every a∈A, i.e. b  ≥  a for every a∈A. Let now b'∈S and b'  ≥  a for every a∈A. The point b is a limit in (S,T) (and, hence, in (S,T-)) of a net [formula] that is finer than the net {a,a∈A}. Put [formula] for every σ∈Σ. Then the net [formula] converges to b' in (S,T+). Since [formula] for every σ∈Σ, we obtain, using [\ref=lm1], that b  ≤  b'. Hence, b =  sup A.

The proof of this lemma is completely analogous to that of Lemma [\ref=lm2].

It follows from the Zorn lemma and [\ref=lm2] (resp. [\ref=lm3]).

(a) We first prove that (Max(S),T+M) is a compact T1-space. Since, for every a∈S, cl(S,T+){a}  =  {b∈S:b  ≥  a} (see [\ref=re3](c)), we obtain that (Max(S),T+M) is a T1-space. Let [formula] be a net in (Max(S),T+M). Then [formula] is a net in the compact space (S,T+) (see [\ref=pr1]) and, hence, it has a cluster point a∈S in (S,T+). Now, we can find a net {aσ',σ'∈Σ'} in (Max(S),T+M) which is finer than the net [formula] and converges to a in (S,T+). By [\ref=lm4], there exists an a'∈Max(S) such that a  ≤  a'. Then a'∈cl(S,T+){a} and, hence, the net {aσ',σ'∈Σ'} converges to a' in (Max(S),T+M). This shows that the net [formula] has a cluster point in (Max(S),T+M). Therefore, the space (Max(S),T+M) is compact.

The proof of the fact that (Min(S),T-m) is a compact T1-space is analogous.

(b) We first prove that (Min(S),T+m) is a Hausdorff space. Indeed, let a,b∈Min(S) and [formula]. Suppose that for any U,V∈L+ such that a∈U and b∈V, we have that [formula]. Then the family F  =  {W∈L+: a∈W or b∈W} has the finite intersection property (see [\ref=pr0]) and its elements are closed subsets of the compact space (S,T-). Consequently there exists a [formula]. Since L+ is a base for T+, we obtain that a∈cl(S,T+){c} and b∈cl(S,T+){c}. Hence c  ≤  a and c  ≤  b. Having in mind that a,b∈Min(S), we get that c = a and c = b, i.e. a = b, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (Min(S),T+m) is a Hausdorff space.

Analogously, one proves that (Max(S),T-M) is a Hausdorff space.

(c) We first prove that Min(S) is dense in (S,T+). Indeed, let x∈U∈T+. By [\ref=lm4], there exists an a∈Min(S) such that a  ≤  x. Then x∈cl(S,T+){a}. Hence [formula]. Therefore, Min(S) is dense in (S,T+).

The proof of the fact that Max(S) is dense in (S,T-) is analogous.

Let's recall the definitions of the coherent spaces and coherent maps:

The categories S and CohSp  are isomorphic.

We shall construct two covariant functors F:  →   and G:  →   such that [formula] and [formula].

For every (S,T+,T-)∈||, we put F(S,T+,T-) = (S,T+). We shall prove that (S,T+)∈||. Indeed, we have: a) the space (S,T+) is compact (by [\ref=pr1]); b) KO(S,T+) = L+ (by [\ref=pr2]) and hence the family KO(S,T+) is a closed under finite intersections base for the topology T+ (by [\ref=pr0] and (SP1) of [\ref=de1]). Therefore we need only to show that (S,T+) is a sober space. We have that (S,T+) is a T0-space (by [\ref=pr1]). Let A be a non-empty irreducible subset of (S,T+). Then A is a closed subset of (S,T), where T  =   sup {T+,T-}. Hence, by [\ref=co2], (A,T+A,T-A) is an abstract spectrum (where T+A (resp. T-A) is the induced by T+ (resp. T-) topology on the subset A of S). We shall prove that |Min(A)| = 1. Suppose that x,y∈Min(A) and [formula]. Let T' be the induced by T+A topology on Min(A). Since (Min(A),T') is a Hausdorff space (by [\ref=pr7](b)), there exists an U∈T' such that x∈U and [formula]. Put [formula] and [formula]. Then B and C are closed subsets of (Min(A),T'), [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Since Min(A) is dense in (A,T+A) (by [\ref=pr7](c)), we obtain that [formula], where B' = cl(A,T+A)B and C' = cl(A,T+A)C. The sets B' and C' are closed in (S,T+) since they are closed in (A,T+A) and A is closed in (S,T+). Moreover, [formula] and [formula], because [formula] and [formula]. Since A is irreducible, we get a contradiction. Therefore, |Min(A)| = 1. Let Min(A) = {a}. Then [\ref=pr7](c) implies that A = cl(S,T+){a}. So, (S,T+) is a sober space. We proved that (S,T+) is a coherent space.

Let f∈((S1,T+1,T-1),(S2,T+2,T-2)). We denote by F(f):S1  →  S2 the function defined by F(f)(x) = f(x) for every x∈S1. We shall show that F(f):(S1,T+1)  →  (S2,T+2) is a coherent map. Indeed, since f is a S-morphism, we have that F(f):(S1,T+1)  →  (S2,T+2) is a continuous map. Let K  ⊆  S2, K∈T+2 and K be a compact subspace of (S2,T+2). Then, by [\ref=pr2], K∈L+2, i.e. [formula]. Hence f- 1(K)∈T+1 and [formula]. Since [formula], we obtain that f- 1(K)∈L+1. Consequently, by [\ref=pr2], f- 1(K) is a compact subspace of (S1,T+1). So, we proved that F(f)∈(F(S1,T+1,T-1),F(S2,T+2,T-2)). The definition of F(f) implies immediately that F preserves the identity maps and that [formula]. Therefore, we constructed a functor F:  →  .

Let now (S,T+)∈||, B+ = KO(S,T+) and [formula]. Since B+ is closed under finite intersections and finite unions, we obtain that B- has the same properties. Obviously, [formula]. Hence the family T- of all subsets of S that are unions of subfamilies of B- is a topology on S and B- is a base for the topological space (S,T-). We shall show that the bitopological space (S,T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum and we will put G(S,T+) = (S,T+,T-).

It is easy to see that B+  ⊆  L+ and B-  ⊆  L- (see [\ref=no1] for the notation). Since, by the definition of a coherent space, the family B+ is a base for the topological space (S,T+) and since the family B- is a base for the space (X,T-), we obtain that L+ (resp. L-) is a base for (S,T+) (resp. (S,T-)). Hence the condition (SP1) of [\ref=de1] is fulfilled. The condition (SP3) of [\ref=de1] is also fulfilled since (S,T+) is a T0-space. Let us put T  =   sup {T+,T-}. We shall prove that the space (S,T) is compact. This will imply immediately that the condition (SP2) of [\ref=de1] is fulfilled.

Obviously, for proving that (S,T) is compact, it is enough to show that every cover of S of the type [formula], where Ω+ (resp. Ω-) is a subfamily of [formula] (resp. [formula]), has a finite subcover. Let Ω* be the family of all finite unions of the elements of Ω-. Then Ω*  ⊆  B-, [formula] and (Ω*,  ⊆  ) is a directed set (i.e. for every U,V∈Ω* there exists a W∈Ω* such that [formula]). Put [formula]. Then [formula] and H is a closed and, hence, compact subset of (S,T+). If we find a U0∈Ω* such that H  ⊆  U0 then we will have that [formula]. From U0∈B- we will get that [formula] and, hence, [formula] will be a compact subset of (S,T+) covered by Ω+. Consequently there will be a finite subfamily Ω+f of Ω+ covering [formula]. Then [formula] will cover S. Therefore, we will find a finite subcover of Ω. So, it is enough to prove that there exists an U0∈Ω* such that H  ⊆  U0.

Put [formula]. Then H+ is a base for the subspace H of (S,T+), H+ is closed under finite unions and finite intersections, H+ is a distributive lattice with respect to the operations [formula] and [formula] and, since H is closed in (S,T+), all elements of H+ are compact subsets of (S,T+). Furthermore, for every U∈Ω* we put [formula]. Then U+∈B+ for every U∈Ω*.

Suppose that for every U∈Ω* we have that [formula]. Then [formula] for every U∈Ω*. Since for every U,V∈Ω* there exists a W∈Ω* such that [formula], the family [formula] has the finite intersection property. Hence it generates a filter φ in H+. Let Φ be an ultrafilter in H+ containing φ and let [formula]. Then L is a non-empty closed subset of (S,T+) and L  ⊆  H. Moreover, [formula] for every W0∈Φ. Indeed, let W0∈Φ. Then W0∈H+ and, hence, W0 is a compact subset of (S,T+). It is easy to see that the family [formula] has the finite intersection property. Consequently [formula]. So, we proved that [formula] for every W0∈Φ. We shall prove now that L is an irreducible subset of (S,T+). Indeed, suppose that [formula], where A and B are closed subsets of (S,T+) and [formula], [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula]. Then there exists a W'∈H+ such that [formula]. Since x∈L, we obtain that [formula] for every W∈Φ. Consequently W'∈Φ. Analogously, taking an [formula], we can find a W''∈Φ such that [formula]. Putting [formula], we get that W0∈Φ. Since [formula], we conclude that [formula] - a contradiction. Therefore, L is an irreducible subset of (S,T+). This implies, because of the fact that (S,T+) is sober, that there exists a point l∈L such that L = cl(S,T+){l}. We shall show that [formula]. Indeed, let U∈Ω*. Then [formula]. Hence [formula]. Let [formula]. Then x∈U+∈T+ and x∈L = cl(S,T+){l}. Consequently l∈U+. So, we proved that [formula]. On the other hand we have that [formula], i.e. [formula] - a contradiction. It shows that there exists a U0∈Ω* such that H  ⊆  U0. Therefore, we proved that the space (S,T) is compact and, hence, that the condition (SP2) of [\ref=de1] is fulfilled. So, the bitopological space (S,T+,T-) is an abstract spectrum.

Let f∈((S1,T+1),(S2,T+2)). We denote by G(f):S1  →  S2 the function defined by G(f)(x) = f(x) for every x∈S1. We shall show that G(f)∈((S1,T+1,T-1),(S2,T+2,T-2)), where (Si,T+i,T-i) = G(Si,T+i), i = 1,2. Indeed, we have that f:(S1,T+1)  →  (S2,T+2) is a continuous map and hence G(f):(S1,T+1)  →  (S2,T+2) is a continuous map. For proving that G(f):(S1,T-1)  →  (S2,T-2) is a continuous map it is enough to show that U∈B-2 implies that f- 1(U)∈B-1 (because B-1 (resp. B-2) is a base for T-1 (resp. T-2)) (here we use the notation introduced above in the process of the definition of G on the objects of the category CohSp). So, let U∈B-2. Then [formula]. Since f is a coherent map, we obtain that [formula]. Obviously, [formula]. Consequently [formula]. So, G(f)∈(G(S1,T+1),G(S2,T+2)). The definition of G(f) implies immediately that G preserves the identity maps and [formula]. Therefore, we constructed a functor G:  →  .

From [\ref=co1] and the constructions of the functors F and G we get that [formula] and [formula]. So, the categories S and CohSp are isomorphic.

The categories DLat and S are dual.

Since the categories DLat and CohSp are dual (see, for example, [\cite=J]), our statement follows immediately from [\ref=th5].

Some Applications

Let's start with recalling that if L is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1 then its classical spectrum spec(L) can be interpreted as an abstract spectrum (see [\ref=ex2], [\ref=pr3] and [\ref=co1]).

We will first prove a general theorem.

Let X be a set, S be a family of subsets of X (i.e. S  ⊆  Exp(X)), T+ and T- be the topologies on S defined in [\ref=th1], and let the bitopological space (S,T+,T-) be an abstract spectrum. Then there exist a distributive lattice L with 0 and 1, and a function φ:X  →  L such that:

(i) the set φ(X) generates L;

(ii) φ- 1(q)∈S for every q∈spec(L) (see [\ref=ex2] for the notation);

(iii) Φ:spec(L)  →  S, q  ↦  φ- 1(q), is an S-isomorphism;

(iv) if L' is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1, and θ:X  →  L' is a function such that:

(1) θ- 1(q)∈S for every q∈spec(L'), and

(2) Θ:spec(L')  →  S, q  ↦  θ- 1(q), is an S-morphism, then there exists a unique lattice homomorphism l:L  →  L' with [formula];

(v) if φ1:X  →  L1, where L1 is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1, is such that:

(1') (φ1)- 1(q)∈S for every q∈spec(L1), and

(2') Φ1:spec(L1)  →  S, q  ↦  (φ1)- 1(q), is an S-isomorphism, then there exists a unique lattice isomorphism l:L  →  L1 with [formula];

(vi) φ:X  →  L is an injection iff for any two different points x and y of X there exists a p∈S containing exactly one of them.

We shall use the notation of [\ref=th1], [\ref=th2] and [\ref=ex2].

By (the proof of) [\ref=th5], we have that (S,T+)∈||. We put L = F'(S,T+) (see [\ref=ni1]), i.e. L = {U∈T+:U is compact} and, hence, by [\ref=pr2], L = L+. Then L is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1. Define the function φ:X  →  L by the formula φ(x) = U+x for every x∈X (recall that [formula] and U+x∈L+ (see [\ref=th1] and the part (b)  ⇒  (a) of its proof)). Hence φ(X) (=  {U+x:x∈X}  =  P+) is a subbase for T+ (see [\ref=th1]). In what follows, the topological space (S,T+) will be denoted, briefly, by S.

The proof of (i): Let L* be the set of all finite unions of the elements of the set B+ of all finite intersections of the elements of P+  =  φ(X). Then L* coincides with the subset of L generated by φ(X) and B+ is a base for T+. If U∈L then U is a compact open subset of S and, hence, it is a finite union of elements of B+. Thus U∈L*. Therefore, the set φ(X) generates L.

The proof of (ii) and (iii): By [\ref=ni1], we have that spec(L) = G'(L). Since the map [formula], [formula] is a CohSp -isomorphism (see [\ref=ni1]), we get that spec(L) = ψS(S).

Let q∈spec(L). Then there exists a unique p∈S such that q = ψS(p). So, we have that [formula], i.e. φ- 1(q) = ψ- 1S(q) for every q∈spec(L). Since the function ψ- 1S is a CohSp -isomorphism, we conclude that the function Φ:spec(L)  →  S, q  →  φ- 1(q), is a CohSp -isomorphism. Now, (the proof of) [\ref=th5] implies, that Φ is an S -isomorphism.

The proof of (iv): Put [formula]. Then, by [\ref=th5] and [\ref=ni1], Θ:spec(L')  →  (S,T+) and [formula] are CohSp -morphisms. Since G'(L') = spec(L') and F'(S,T+) = L, we obtain that [formula] (see [\ref=ni1]). Put [formula] (using the notation from [\ref=ni1]). Then l:L  →  L' is a lattice homomorphism. We shall prove that [formula]. This will imply that [formula] and, hence, we wll have that [formula], i.e. that [formula].

Let x∈X. Then [formula]. On the other hand, [formula]. Put [formula]. Since ψ- 1S  =  Φ (see the proof of (ii) and (iii) above), we get that (F'(ψS))- 1 = F'(ψ- 1S) = F'(Φ). Hence [formula]. Now, the definition of F'(Φ) (see [\ref=ni1]) implies that (F'(Φ))(U) = Φ- 1(U). Hence [formula]. Since Φ is an isomorphism (see (iii)), we get that [formula], i.e U = U+x. Therefore, [formula]. Then [formula]. So, we proved that [formula]. This, combined with the fact that φ(X) generates L (see (i)), proves the uniqueness of l.

The proof of (v): Let φ1:X  →  L1 has the properties (1') and (2'). Then, using (iv), we obtain a lattice homomorphism l:L  →  L1 such that [formula]. From the construction of l, given in (iv), we have that [formula]. Since Φ1 is an CohSp -isomorphism (by (2') and [\ref=th5]), we get that l is a DLat -isomorphism (because all other components of the composition defining l are also DLat -isomorphisms (see [\ref=ni1])).

The proof of (vi): Let x,y∈X and [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. Hence, [formula] iff there exists a p∈S containing exactly one of the points x and y.

Let X be a set endowed with two arbitrary multivalued binary operations [formula] and [formula] and with two fixed different points ξ0∈X and ξ1∈X. Then there exist a distributive lattice [formula] with 0 and 1, and a function φ:X  →  L such that:

(i) the set φ(X) generates L;

(ii) φ- 1(q)∈S(X)pr for every q∈spec(L) (resp. φ- 1(q)∈S(X) for every q∈spec(L)) (see [\ref=th2] and [\ref=ex2] for the notation);

(iii) Φ:spec(L)  →  S(X)pr, q  ↦  φ- 1(q) (resp. Φ:spec(L)  →  S(X), q  →  φ- 1(q)) is an S-isomorphism;

(iv) if L' is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1, and θ:X  →  L' is a function such that:

(1) θ- 1(q)∈S(X)pr (resp. θ- 1(q)∈S(X)) for every q∈spec(L'), and

(2) Θ:spec(L')  →  S(X)pr, q  ↦  θ- 1(q), (resp. Θ:spec(L')  →  S(X), q  ↦  θ- 1(q),) is an S-morphism, then there exists a unique lattice homomorphism l:L  →  L' with [formula];

(v) if φ1:X  →  L1, where L1 is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1, is such that:

(1') (φ1)- 1(q)∈S(X)pr for every q∈spec(L1) (resp. (φ1)- 1(q)∈S(X) for every q∈spec(L1)), and

(2') Φ1:spec(L1)  →  S(X)pr, q  ↦  (φ1)- 1(q) (resp. Φ1:spec(L1)  →  S(X), q  ↦  (φ1)- 1(q)) is an S-isomorphism, then there exists a unique lattice isomorphism l:L  →  L1 with [formula];

(vi) [formula] and [formula] for any a,b∈X.

Denote by S the set S(X)pr (resp. S(X)) (see [\ref=th2] for the notation) and define the topologies T+pr (resp. T+) and T-pr (resp. T-) on S as in [\ref=th1]. Then, by [\ref=th2], the bitopological space (S,T+pr,T-pr) (resp. (S,T+,T-)) is an abstract spectrum. Hence, applying Theorem [\ref=th66], we obtain a distributive lattice [formula] and a function φ:X  →  L satisfying conditions (i)-(v) of [\ref=th66] and, hence, our conditions (i)-(v) as well. Consequently, we need only to check that the condition (vi) is also satisfied. In what follows, the notation of the proof of [\ref=th66] and the construction of the function φ given there are used.

Let a,b∈X and [formula]. Then [formula] [formula] or [formula]. Hence [formula] and b∈p}. Let [formula] and suppose that [formula]. Then a∈p' and b∈p'. This implies that [formula]. Then x∈p' and, hence, [formula] - a contradiction. Therefore, [formula]. This shows that [formula], i.e. [formula], for every [formula]. Consequently, [formula] for any a,b∈X.

Let [formula]. We have that [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that [formula]. Then x∈p' and, hence, [formula]. This implies that a∈p' or b∈p', i.e. we get a contradiction. Therefore, p'∈φ(x). So, [formula], i.e. [formula] for every [formula].

Let X be a set endowed with two arbitrary single-valued binary operations +   and ×   and with two fixed different points ξo∈X and ξ1∈X. Then there exist a distributive lattice [formula] with 0 and 1, and a function φ:X  →  L such that:

(i) the set φ(X) generates L;

(ii) φ- 1(q)∈S'(X) for every q∈spec(L) (resp. φ- 1(q)∈S'(X)pr for every q∈spec(L)) (see [\ref=th4], [\ref=ex2] and [\ref=th2] for the notation);

(iii) Φ:spec(L)  →  S'(X), q  ↦  φ- 1(q), (resp. Φ:spec(L)  →  S'(X)pr, q  ↦  φ- 1(q),) is an S-isomorphism;

(iv) if L' is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1, and θ:X  →  L' is a function such that:

(1) θ- 1(q)∈S'(X) (resp. θ- 1(q)∈S'(X)pr) for every q∈spec(L'), and

(2) Θ:spec(L')  →  S'(X), q  ↦  θ- 1(q) (resp. Θ:spec(L')  →  S'(X)pr, q  ↦  θ- 1(q)) is an S-morphism, then there exists a unique lattice homomorphism l:L  →  L' with [formula];

(v) if φ1:X  →  L1, where L1 is a distributive lattice with 0 and 1, is such that:

(1') (φ1)- 1(q)∈S'(X) for every q∈spec(L1) (resp. (φ1)- 1(q)∈S'(X)pr for every q∈spec(L1)), and

(2') Φ1:spec(L1)  →  S'(X), q  ↦  (φ1)- 1(q) (resp. Φ1:spec(L1)  →  S'(X)pr, q  ↦  (φ1)- 1(q)) is an S-isomorphism, then there exists a unique lattice isomorphism l:L  →  L1 with [formula];

(vi) [formula] and [formula] for every a,b∈X.

Denote by S the set S'(X) (resp. S'(X)pr) (see [\ref=th4] for the notation) and introduce the topologies T+ (resp. T+pr) and T- (resp. T-pr) on S as in [\ref=th1]. Then, by [\ref=th4], the bitopological space (S,T+,T-) (resp. (S,T+pr,T-pr) ) is an abstract spectrum. Hence, applying Theorem [\ref=th66], we obtain a distributive lattice [formula] and a function φ:X  →  L satisfying conditions (i)-(v) of [\ref=th66] and, hence, our conditions (i)-(v) as well. Consequently, we need only to check that the condition (vi) is also satisfied. This can be done easily (see the proof of [\ref=th6]).

Separative algebras

The main aim of this section is to give a detailed exposition of the theory of separative algebras, introduced and announces by Prodanov in [\cite=P1]. This theory is a straight generalization of the theory of convex spaces in the sense of Tagamlitzki [\cite=T], which have been also a subject of Prodanov's Ph.D. dissertation [\cite=PD]. We will follow very closely the style of Prodanov's proofs from [\cite=P5] and [\cite=PD].

Preseparative algebras

Let [formula] be a set with two binary multivalued operations denoted by ``  ×  " and `` + ". This means that for any x,y∈X, x  ×  y  ⊆  X and x  +  y  ⊆  X. Later on, instead of ``  ×  " and `` + ", we shall use ``." and `` + ", and following the common mathematical practice, sometimes we shall omit the sign ``.".

We extend the operations ``." and `` + " for arbitrary subsets A and B of X putting

[formula]

The one element subset {x}  ⊆  X will be denoted simply by x. Then for instance x(yz) will mean {x}.(y.z).

By means of the operations ``." and `` + ", we introduce two new operations as follows: division:     a / b = {x∈X:a∈b.x} and difference: a - b = {x∈X:a∈b + x}.

We extend the operations division and difference for arbitrary subsets putting

[formula]

Sometimes instead of A / B we will write A:B or [formula].

The following lemma follows immediately from the relevant definitions.

(i) [formula] iff [formula]: [formula] iff [formula]: x∈A / B and x∈C iff [formula] a∈A, b∈B x∈a / b and x∈C iff [formula]: a∈A, b∈B, a∈b.x and x∈C iff [formula]: a∈A and a∈B.C iff [formula]: [formula] iff [formula].

The proof of (ii) is similar.

As an example we shall verify (i) . The proof of the remaining conditions is similar.

x∈AB iff [formula] [formula]: x∈ab iff (by commutativity of ``.") [formula] [formula]: x∈ba iff x∈BA.

Associativity enables us to write [formula] and [formula] without parentheses.

We denote An = A.A....A (n-times) and nA = A + A + ... + A (n-times), putting A1 = 1A = A.

(i) and (i') follow immediately from the definition, and (ii) and (ii') follow from Lemma [\ref=3.1.2](iii') and commutativity.

As an example we shall show the equivalence of the Axiom (iii) with (i).

((Axiom (iii))→   (i)). Let [formula]. Then there exists y∈X such that x∈a + y, [formula] and b∈c + y. By Axiom (iii), [formula]. Then, by Proposition [\ref=3.1.3](i), we obtain that [formula] and hence [formula]. Since x is an arbitrary element of X, this shows that [formula].

((i)→   (Axiom (iii))). Let a∈b + x and c∈dx. Then [formula] and [formula]. Then, by (i), [formula], so that [formula]. Applying Proposition [\ref=3.1.3](i), we obtain that [formula], which shows that Axiom (iii) holds.

The equivalence of Axiom (iii) with (ii) can be proved similarly by using Proposition [\ref=3.1.3](ii).

(i) and (ii) are extensions of (i) and (ii) of Proposition [\ref=3.1.6] for arbitrary sets and follow directly from Proposition [\ref=3.1.6].

(iii) Let x be an arbitrary element of X. Then, applying Proposition [\ref=3.1.3](i), we obtain that x∈(A / B) / C iff [formula] iff [formula] iff [formula] iff [formula] iff [formula] iff x∈A / (BC). Hence, (A / B) / C = A / (BC).

(iv) The proof can be done similarly by applying Proposition [\ref=3.1.3](ii).

(v) [formula]. We have applied two times (i) and then (iii).

(vi) The proof can be done similarly by applying two times (ii) and then (iv).

Filters and ideals in preseparative algebras

Obviously the empty set [formula] and the whole set X are examples of a filter, ideal, prime filter and prime ideal. They are in some sense trivial examples. Nontrivial examples of filters and ideals will be given by the constructions μ(A) and α(A) below. Constructions of prime filters and prime ideals will be given in Section 3.4 for separative algebras.

The following lemma follows immediately from the definitions of filter and ideal.

Let A  ⊆  X. We define μ(A) - the multiplicative closure of A, by putting μ(A) to be the intersection of all filters containing A. By Lemma [\ref=3.2.2], μ(A) is the smallest filter containing A. Analogously, the intersection of all ideals containing A, denoted by α(A) and called the additive closure of A, is the smallest ideal containing A.

(i) To prove the equality (i) it is enough to show that [formula] is the smallest filter containing A. By Lemma [\ref=3.1.2](iv), we have [formula], so [formula] is a filter, which obviously contains A. To prove that [formula] is the smallest filter containing A, let α be a filter and A  ⊆  α. Applying Lemma [\ref=3.1.2](ii), we can show by induction on i that Ai  ⊆  αi  ⊆  α and consequently [formula].

(i') can be shown similarly.

(ii) The proof of the conditions a), b), c) and d) follow directly from the definition of μ. To prove condition e), we shall show that the set [formula], where F = μ(A) and G = μ(B), is the smallest filter containing [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=3.1.5](ii), we obtain

[formula]

This shows that [formula] is a filter containing F and G and hence A and B. To show that [formula] is the smallest filter containing A and B, let γ be a filter such that A  ⊆  γ and B  ⊆  γ, so we have F  ⊆  γ and G  ⊆  γ. Then [formula], FG  ⊆  γγ  ⊆  γ and consequently [formula].

The proof of (ii') can be obtained in a similar way.

We shall proof (iv); the proofs of the other conditions are similar. Applying Proposition [\ref=3.1.3], we obtain:

[formula]; since [formula], we get that [formula].

Let

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=3.2.3](i)(i'), we have that

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=(1)]), ([\ref=(2)]) and ([\ref=(3)]), we obtain that for some x∈X, [formula] and [formula]. Then for some i and j we have that

[formula]

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=(4)]) that there exist a set [formula] such that [formula]. From here we obtain that [formula] and consequently

[formula]

In an analogous way we obtain from ([\ref=(5)]) that there exists a finite subset [formula] such that

[formula]

Then from ([\ref=(1)]) and ([\ref=(6)]) and ([\ref=(7)]) we obtain

[formula]

Thus, for some finite subsets A'  ⊆  A and B'  ⊆  B, we have [formula].

Separative algebras

Let  = (X,.,  +  ) be a preseparative algebra. For x,y∈X define

[formula]

Convex spaces have been studied by several authors: Tagamlitzki [\cite=T], Prodanov [\cite=P4] [\cite=P5], Bair [\cite=B], Bryant [\cite=Br], Bryant and Webster [\cite=BrW].

We will now give several examples of separative algebras.

Let [formula] be a distributive lattice and for x,y∈X define [formula] and [formula] (see Example [\ref=ex2]). Then [formula] is a separative algebra.

Let  = (X,1, + ,.) be a commutative ring and for x,y∈X define x  ×  y = x.y and x  +  y = A(x,y) , where A(x,y) is the ring-ideal generated by the set {x,y} (see Example [\ref=ex1]). Then [formula] is a separative algebra.

Let [formula] be a real linear space. For arbitrary a,b∈X, we set a  ×  b = a  +  b = {ta + (1 - t)b:0  ≤  t  ≤  1}. Then [formula] is a convex space.

Apart from these starting examples, there is a number of other ones. It seems that whenever we have a satisfactory theory of prime ideals, then there is also a structure of separative algebra.

Let X be an ordered linear topological space. Then X is a separative algebra with respect to the operations

[formula],

[formula], where ab = {ta + (1 - t)b:0  ≤  t  ≤  1}.

Let  = (X,.) be a commutative semigroup. Then [formula] is a convex space.

The following lemma for filters and ideals is very important.

Suppose that the lemma does not hold and proceed to obtain a contradiction. Then for some A,B  ⊆  X and x∈X we have that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=3.2.3]((ii)e)((ii')e), we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=1(1)]), ([\ref=1(3)]) and ([\ref=1(5)]), we obtain that

either (a) [formula],

or      (b) [formula].

From ([\ref=1(2)]), ([\ref=1(3)]) and ([\ref=1(4)]), we obtain that

either (a') [formula],

or      (b') [formula].

So, we have to consider and to obtain a contradiction in each of the following combinations of cases: (aa'), (ab'), (ba') and (bb'). As an example we shall treat of only the case (aa') - the remaining cases can be treated in a similar way. For the sake of brevity, we put F = μ(A), I = α(B); note that F is a filter and I is an ideal. Now (a) and (a') become:

(a) [formula] and

(a') [formula].

Applying Proposition [\ref=3.1.3] to (a) and (a'), we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=1(5')]), we conclude that there exists y∈X such that

[formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=1(6)]), we obtain that for some z∈X we have

[formula]

[formula]

Conditions ([\ref=1(7)]) and ([\ref=1(9)]) are equivalent respectively to

[formula]

[formula]

Since y  ⊆  α(y), using ([\ref=1(11)]), we get

[formula]

and, consequently, x  ≤  y.

Since z  ⊆  μ(z), using ([\ref=1(12)]), we get

[formula]

and, consequently, z  ≤  x.

Now, by the axiom (Sep0), we obtain that z  ≤  y and, consequently,

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=3.2.4](i), F - I is a filter and since, by ([\ref=1(10)]), z∈F - I, we get that

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=3.2.4](i'), [formula] is an ideal and since, by ([\ref=1(8)]), [formula], we get that

[formula]

From ([\ref=1(16)]) and ([\ref=1(17)]), we get that

[formula]

By ([\ref=1(15)]) and ([\ref=1(18)]), we obtain that

[formula]

Applying Proposition [\ref=3.2.4](iv), we obtain that [formula], i.e. [formula], which contradicts ([\ref=1(3)]). This completes the proof of the lemma.

If F is a filter, I is an ideal and [formula], then, for any x∈X, either [formula] or [formula].

Separation theorem

The main aim of this section is the following:

(Separation theorem for separative algebras) Let  = (X,.,  +  ) be a separative algebra. Then [formula] satisfies the Separation principle (Sep).

Let F0 be a filter in [formula], I0 be an ideal in [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula]. It is easy to see that M with the set-inclusion ⊆   is an inductive set and hence, by the Zorn lemma, M has a maximal element, say F.

Let [formula]. The set N supplied with the set-inclusion is also an inductive set and hence, by the Zorn lemma, it has a maximal element, say I. We shall show that F is a prime filter and I is a prime ideal.

Since F is a filter, I is an ideal and [formula], it is enough to show that [formula]. Let x∈X. We shall show that either x∈F or x∈I. Since [formula], Corollary [\ref=3.3.8] implies that either [formula] or [formula].

Case 1: [formula]. Since I0  ⊆  I, we obtain that [formula]. We also have that [formula]. From here we obtain that the filter [formula]. By the maximality of F in M, we obtain that [formula], and hence x∈F.

Case 2: [formula]. Since [formula], we obtain that [formula]. Then, by the maximality of I in N, we obtain that [formula], and hence x∈I.

So we have found a prime filter F  ⊇  F0 and a prime ideal I  ⊇  I0 such that [formula], which proves the theorem.

Let's note that Theorem [\ref=3.4.1] generalizes a few well known statements: the Stone separation theorem for filters and ideals in distributive lattices [\cite=Sto2] and in Boolean algebras [\cite=Sto1], as well as the separation theorem for convex sets in convex spaces from [\cite=T].

Let  = (X,.,  +  ) be a preseparative algebra. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is a separative algebra,

(ii) [formula] satisfies the Separation principle (Sep).

The implication (i)→  (ii) is just Theorem [\ref=3.4.1]. For the converse implication (ii)→  (i), we have to show that (Sep) implies (Sep0) (see Definition [\ref=3.3.1] for (Sep0)). So, let a,b,c∈X,

[formula]

[formula]

and suppose that

[formula]

Then ([\ref=2(3)]) and (Sep) imply that there exist a prime filter F and and a prime ideal I such that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=2(1)]) and ([\ref=2(5)]) we obtain

[formula]

From ([\ref=2(2)]) and ([\ref=2(6)]) we obtain

[formula]

For the element b we have, by ([\ref=2(4)]), that either b∈F or b∈I.

Case 1: b∈F. Then μ(b)  ⊆  F and, by ([\ref=2(8)]), we obtain that [formula] - a contradiction with ([\ref=2(4)]).

Case 2: b∈I. Then α(b)  ⊆  I and, by ([\ref=2(7)]), we obtain that [formula] - again a contradiction with ([\ref=2(4)]).

This completes the proof of the theorem.

We shall conclude this section by showing that the Separation theorem is equivalent to the following statement, which is a generalization of the well known Wallman's lemma:

Let  = (X,.,  +  ) be a preseparative algebra. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is a separative algebra,

((ii) (Wallman's lemma) Let M be a filter in X and let, for any prime filter F  ⊇  M, an element xF∈F be chosen. Then there exists a finite number of prime filters Fi  ⊇  M, [formula], such that [formula].

(i)→  (ii).  Let [formula] be a separative algebra and M be a filter in [formula]. Denote by N the set of all elements xF, chosen as in the condition of the Wallman's lemma. Then [formula]. To prove this suppose the contrary. Then there exists a prime filter F  ⊇  M such that [formula]. But this is impossible because xF∈N  ⊆  α(N). So, [formula]. Now, by Lemma [\ref=3.2.5], there exists a finite subset [formula] such that [formula].

(ii)→  (i).  Suppose the Wallman's lemma. We shall prove the Separation principle (Sep). Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that (Sep) does not hold. Then, for some filter F0 and some ideal I0 such that [formula], we have that any prime filter F extending F0 has a non-empty intersection with I0, i.e, there exists [formula]. Then, by the Wallman lemma, there exists a finite set [formula] such that [formula]. But [formula], so that [formula], which implies [formula] - a contradiction.

Standardization of the operations

Here we shall consider two couples of natural operations in a given separative algebra.

Let [formula] be a separative algebra and, for any a,b∈X, define the following two new multivalued operations, called convex operations:

[formula]

If [formula] is a separative algebra then it remains separative algebra with respect to its convex operations.

The easy proof follows from the observation that the filters and ideals with respect to convex operations remain the same.

Let [formula] be a separative algebra. For any A  ⊆  X, let μρ(A) be the intersection of all prime filters containing A, and αρ(A) be the intersections of all prime ideals containing A. A subset A of X will be called a radical filter (resp., a radical ideal) if μρ(A) = A (resp., αρ(A) = A).

It follows from the Separation theorem that if A is an ideal (resp. filter), then

[formula]

The following two new operations in X are called radical operations:

[formula]

where a,b∈X.

If [formula] is a separative algebra then it remains separative algebra with respect to its radical operations.

The proof follows from the observation that the filters and ideals with respect to the radical operations are the radical filters and radical ideals with respect to the initial operations, but the order ≤   do not change. To show this, note that μρ(a) = μρ(μ(a)) and αρ(b) = αρ(α(b)). Then, by the above observation, we have that

[formula]

[formula]

Then [formula] iff [formula]: a  ≤  x and x  ≤  b iff a  ≤  b.

Canonical representation

Let [formula] be a separative algebra. Then [formula] has a canonical representation φ:X  →  L into a distributive lattice with the properties from Corollary [\ref=th6]. Now φ has some additional properties.

First of all, the inequality a  ≤  b takes place if and only if φ(a)  ⊆  φ(b) . Therefore φ(a) = φ(b) if and only if the radical ideals containing a contain b and conversely. If we do not distinguishing such points (which is natural, if we are interested only in radical ideals and filters), φ becomes an embedding.

Now the operations from Corollary [\ref=th6](v) look in the following manner:

[formula]

where a.b and a + b are the radical operations. In particular, if the initial operations coincide with radical ones, as it is in Example [\ref=3.3.4], we can get the separative structure of X from suitable embedding of X into a distributive lattice.

Now, let [formula] be a ring with the separative structure from Example [\ref=3.3.3], and let φ:X  →  L be the canonical representation. Then L can be identified with the distributive lattice of all finitely generated radical ideals of X (the whole X is included), and, for arbitrary a∈X, the image φ(a) is the radical ideal in X generated by a.

Topological version of the separation theorem

Clearly, every separative algebra X endowed with the discrete topology is a separative space, but there are also analytical examples. Now we shall only note that if [formula] is a topological preseparative algebra such that the topology of [formula] has a basis from open filters, then X is a separative space.

The next statement, which we include here without proof, is a topological version of the Separation theorem.

Let [formula] be a separative space, I0 be an ideal in X and F0 be an open filter in X such that [formula]. Then there exist a closed prime ideal I and an open prime filter F in X such that F0  ⊆  F, I0  ⊆  I and [formula].

For a proof of Theorem [\ref=3.8.2] for topological convex spaces see [\cite=T]. We shall notice only one application of the theorem which uses the separative (not convex) structure: Example [\ref=3.3.5] and Theorem [\ref=3.8.2] give the classical separation theorem in ordered linear spaces, and, in particular, the general representation theorem of Kadison [\cite=K].
