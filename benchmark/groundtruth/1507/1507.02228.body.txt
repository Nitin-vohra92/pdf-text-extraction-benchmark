Keywords: Attractor Crisis, Transfer Operators, Bifurcation Theory, Response Theory, Structural Stability

Introduction

Much progress has been achieved during the last decades regarding bifurcation theory of low-dimensional dynamical systems and the emergence of aperiodic behaviour and sensitive dependence to initial conditions, or chaos, when a parameter of the system is changed. Examples include changes in the Rayleigh number in hydrodynamics [\cite=Lorenz1963a] or in the solar constant in climate science [\cite=Saltzman2002]. Much less is known, however, on the sudden appearance or destruction of chaotic attractors. The review by [\cite=Grebogi1983] provides a good starting point regarding the topological description of attractor crisis and the statistics of chaotic transients. However, little is known regarding the changes in statistical properties of high-dimensional chaotic systems undergoing an attractor crisis.

While it is a classical result that bifurcations involving non-chaotic invariant sets are associated with Lyapunov exponents crossing the imaginary axis and with the critical slowing down of trajectories [\cite=Strogatz1994], what happens before a chaotic attractor is destroyed is less understood. One reason for this is that the Lyapunov spectrum of high-dimensional systems is virtually inaccessible, either analytically or numerically, even when averaged over the attractor. However, one would still expect critical slowing down to occur before the destruction of a chaotic attractor when the control parameter approaches its critical value at which the crisis occurs.. The system must take more and more time to recover from exogenous perturbations and also from spontaneous fluctuations due to instabilities on the attractor. To make the distinction clear between the low-dimensional case and the chaotic case, we will here prefer the term "attractor crisis" rather than "bifurcation". We will also avoid the term "tipping point", often used in geophysics, because, even though a clear definition has been given in [\cite=Lenton2008], its mathematical characterisation remains vague and may refer to different concepts such as bifurcation, phase transition [\cite=LeBellac2004] or catastrophe [\cite=Arnold1986].

For high-dimensional chaotic systems, geometrical approaches soon become intractable. However, statistical physics methods developed for nonequilibrium systems can become very fruitful [\cite=Eckmann1985] [\cite=Young2002] [\cite=Gallavotti2014]. Following the ground-breaking ideas of Boltzmann, a steady-state is described as a time invariant probability measure (a statistical steady-state) rather than a point in phase space. It is a fundamental property of nonequilibrium systems that the invariant measure is supported on a strange attractor with dimensionality lower than that of the phase space. This is the result of a contraction rate of the phase space that is positive on average and indicates the presence of a positive rate of entropy production [\cite=Ruelle1989] [\cite=Gallavotti2014]. While most results concerning nonequilibrium mechanics have been found for the particular case of smooth uniformly hyperbolic systems [\cite=Young1998], their applicability to more general physical systems with a large number of degrees of freedom and exhibiting chaotic dynamics has been motivated by the Chaotic Hypothesis in [\cite=Gallavotti1995] (see also [\cite=Gallavotti2014]).

In the particular, yet physically highly relevant, case of mixing systems, probability distributions converge to a unique invariant measure [\cite=Lasota1994]. How such relaxation occurs is described by the spectrum of transfer operators governing the evolution of distributions by the dynamics [\cite=Ruelle1986] [\cite=Gaspard1998] [\cite=Baladi2000]. If a system close to undergo a crisis experiences a slowing down, the relaxation time of densities to the invariant measure must become very long, because trajectories take more and more time to converge to the more and more weakly attracting invariant set. Since this relaxation time can be traced back to the inverse of the real part of the eigenspectrum of the transfer operators, the latter must thus get closer and closer to the imaginary axis as the crisis is approached. This simple idea is also supported by the fact that the gap between the leading eigenvalue of the transfer operators (associated with the invariant measure) and the secondary eigenvalues gives a measure of the size of the perturbation for which one can expect the response of the system to be smooth [\cite=Butterley2007] [\cite=Ruelle2009] [\cite=Lucarini2015b]. Since the response of a system at the crisis is definitely rough as an infinitesimal perturbation can lead to an attractor change, the gap in the eigenspectrum of the transfer operators is expected to shrink at the crisis.

For some smooth uniformly hyperbolic systems, the discrete spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators acting on Banach spaces, taking into account the dynamics of contraction and expansion on the stable and unstable manifolds, has been shown to be stable to perturbations [\cite=Gouezel2006] [\cite=Butterley2007] and is accessible via numerical schemes [\cite=Froyland2007a]. Moreover, for high-dimensional systems, it has been shown in [\cite=Chekroun2014] that the leading part of the spectrum can also be estimated numerically, but is dependent on the appropriate choice of an observable [\cite=Tantet2015].

In this study, we explore the properties of an attractor crisis by taking an example from climate physics. This field has motivated many new concepts in dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics. Prominent examples are the case of chaos itself [\cite=Lorenz1963a], the use of stochastic dynamical systems [\cite=Hasselmann1976] [\cite=Saltzman2002], the interpretation of complex climatic features using bifurcation theory [\cite=Dijkstra2005a] [\cite=Dijkstra2005b], the study of predictability of chaotic flows with its practical implications [\cite=Kalnay2003], methods for studying multiscale systems and developing parameterisations [\cite=Majda2001] [\cite=Wouters2012] [\cite=Wouters2013a] [\cite=Franzke2015a], and the use of response theory for studying how the climate responds to forcing [\cite=Gritsun2007] [\cite=Abramov2007] [\cite=Lucarini2011] [\cite=Lucarini2014b] [\cite=Ragone2015].

There are many indications that the climate of our planet is multistable, i.e. the present astronomical conditions are compatible with two climatic regimes, the present-day state, and the so-called Snowball state, whereby the Earth experiences extremely cold conditions. Paleoclimatological studies support the fact that in the distant past (about 700 Mya) the Earth was in such a Snowball state, and it is still a matter of debate which mechanisms brought the planet in the present warm state. Note that the issue of multistability is extremely relevant for the present ongoing investigations of habitability of exoplanets [\cite=Lucarini2013a]. Multistability is found for climate models across a hierarchical ladder of complexity, ranging from simple Energy Balance Models [\cite=Budyko1969] [\cite=Sellers1968] [\cite=Ghil1976a] to fully coupled global circulation models [\cite=Pierrehumbert2011a] [\cite=Voigt2010]. The robustness of such features is tied to the presence of an extremely powerful positive feedback which controls the transitions between the two competing states, the so-called ice-albedo feedback. The presence of a positive anomaly in ice cover favours a decrease of the absorbed radiation, because ice effectively reflects incoming solar radiation. This leads to a decrease in the surface temperature, which favours the formation of ice.

The Planet Simulator (PlaSim) [\cite=Fraedrich2005a] [\cite=Fraedrich2005b] is a model displaying chaotic behavior. The model is complex enough to represent the main physical mechanisms of climate multistability, yet sufficiently fast to perform extensive numerical simulations [\cite=Lucarini2010a] [\cite=Boschi2013]. In the present study, we demonstrate that critical slowing down is observed in PlaSim before the destruction of the chaotic attractor corresponding to a warm climate. This slowing down is visible for observables supported by the attractor (thus from simulations which have already converged to the attractor, without having to perturb the system). The slowing down is described by the leading eigenvalues of coarse-grained approximations of the transfer operators, constructed from a long simulation of the dynamical system and capturing the fundamental features of the attractor crisis.

Section 2 below briefly describes the climate model as well as the set up of different simulations for varying values of the control parameter. The spectral theory of transfer operators and the link to the slow decay of correlations associated with critical slowing down is described in section 3. This section contains also a presentation of the numerical method used to approximate the spectrum of transfer operators. The results are presented in section 4, where critical slowing down is shown to occur in the model as the attractor crisis is approached and to be associated with the approximated leading eigenvalues of the transfer operators getting closer to the imaginary axis. The results are summarised in section 5 where we explain the observed critical slowing down from the theory of boundary crisis [\cite=Grebogi1983] and discuss its applications to response theory and the design of early-warning indicators of the crisis.

Model and simulations

As mentioned above, the attractor crises corresponding to the transition between warm states and snowball climate states has been replicated with qualitatively similar feature in a variety of models of various degrees of complexity. Given the goals of this study, we need a climate model that is simple enough to allow for an exploration of parameters in the vicinity of the attractor crisis and complex enough to feature essential characteristics of high-dimensional, dissipative, and chaotic systems, as the existence of a limited horizon of predictability due to the presence of instabilities in the flow. We have opted for using PlaSim, a climate model of so-called intermediate complexity. This model has already been used for several theoretical climate studies and provides an efficient platform for investigating climate transitions when changing boundary conditions and parameters.

The Planet Simulator (PlaSim)

The dynamical core of PlaSim is based on the Portable University Model of the Atmosphere PUMA [\cite=Fraedrich1998]. The atmospheric dynamics is modelled using the primitive equations formulated for vorticity, divergence, temperature and the logarithm of surface pressure. Moisture is included by transport of water vapour (specific humidity). The governing equations are solved using the spectral transform method [\cite=Eliasen1970] [\cite=Orszag1970]. In the vertical, non-equally spaced sigma (pressure divided by surface pressure) levels are used. The parametrization of unresolved processes consists of long- [\cite=Sasamori1968] and short- [\cite=Lacis1974] wave radiation, interactive clouds [\cite=Stephens1978] [\cite=Stephens1984] [\cite=Slingo1991], moist [\cite=Kuo1965] [\cite=Kuo1974] and dry convection, large-scale precipitation, boundary layer fluxes of latent and sensible heat and vertical and horizontal diffusion [\cite=Louis1979] [\cite=Louis1981] [\cite=Laursen1989] [\cite=Roeckner1992]. The land surface scheme uses five diffusive layers for the temperature and a bucket model for the soil hydrology. The oceanic part is a 50 m mixed-layer (swamp) ocean, which includes a thermodynamic sea ice model [\cite=Semtner1976].

The horizontal transport of heat in the ocean can either be prescribed or parametrized by horizontal diffusion. In this case, we consider the simplified setting where the ocean gives no contribution to the large-scale heat transport. While such a simplified setting is somewhat less realistic, the climate simulated by the model is definitely Earth-like, featuring qualitatively correct large scale features and turbulent atmospheric dynamics. Beside standard output, PlaSim provides comprehensive diagnostics for the nonequilibrium thermodynamical properties of the climate system and in particular for local and global energy and entropy budgets. PlaSim is freely available including a graphical user interface facilitating its use. PUMA and PlaSim have been applied to a variety of problems in climate response theory [\cite=Ragone2015], entropy production [\cite=Lucarini2014a] [\cite=Fraedrich2008], and in the dynamics of exoplanets [\cite=Lucarini2013a].

Attractor crisis and instability mechanism

In [\cite=Lucarini2010a] and [\cite=Boschi2013], a parameter sweep in PlaSim is performed by changing the solar constant. The resulting changes in the Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) are represented in figure [\ref=fig:hysteresis], taken from [\cite=Boschi2013]. For a large range of values of the solar constant there are two distinct statistical steady states, which can be characterised by a large difference -- of the order of 40-50 K -- in the value of the GMST. The upper branch in figure [\ref=fig:hysteresis] corresponds to warm (W) climate conditions (akin to present day) and the lower cold branch represents snowball (SB) states. The W branch is depicted with a thin line, whereas the SB branch is depicted with a thick line. In the SB states, the planet is characterised by a greatly enhanced albedo due to a massive ice-cover.

The actual integration of the model is performed by starting from present-day climate conditions and decreasing the value of S, until a sharp W →   SB transition is observed, corresponding to the attractor crisis, occurring at S  ≈  1263(Wm- 2). The critical value of the solar constant needed to induce the onset of snowball conditions basically agrees with that found in [\cite=Poulsen2004a] and in [\cite=Voigt2010] (see also [\cite=Wetherald1975], Fig. 5). The SB state is realised for values of the solar constant up to S  ≈  1433(Wm- 2), where the reverse SB →   W transition occurs. Hence, in the model there are two rather distinct climatic states for the presenday solar irradiance [\cite=Voigt2010].

These W - SB transitions are induced by the ice-albedo positive feedback [\cite=Budyko1969] [\cite=Sellers1968] which is strong enough to destabilise both W and SB states. The main ingredient of this feedback is the increase in the albedo (i.e. the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected by a surface) due to the presence of ice. When a negative (positive) perturbation in surface temperature results in temperatures below (above) the freezing point (Tf  ≈  271.8K, for sea ice), ice is formed (melts). Because of the larger albedo of the ice compared to ocean or land surfaces, this increase (decrease) in the ice-cover extent leads to a decrease (increase) of the surface temperature, further favouring the formation (melting) of ice. The dominant damping processes of this growth mechanism include the local decrease of emitted long-wave radiation with decreasing temperatures and the meridional heat transport from the equator to the poles. However, as the solar constant is decreased to criticality, these negative feedbacks are not sufficient to damp the ice-albedo feedback and the transitions occur.

In more idealized models [\cite=Scott1999] or, in general, in non-chaotic models [\cite=Lucarini2007a], bistability is typically associated with the presence of two stable fixed points separated by a saddle-node, and the loss of a fixed point is related to a bifurcation determining the change in the sign of one eigenvalue of the system linearised around the fixed point. In the present case, instead, the two branches define the presence of two parametrically modulated (by the changes in the value of the solar constant) families of disjoint strange attractors, as in each climate state the dynamics of the system is definitely chaotic. This is suggested by the fact that, for example, the system features variability on all time-scales [\cite=Schalge2013] which corresponds, to having intransitive climate conditions [\cite=Lorenz1967] [\cite=Peixoto1992]. The loss of stability occurring through the W →   SB and SB →   W transitions is related to the catastrophic disappearance of one of the two strange attractors [\cite=Grebogi1983]. Near the transitions, the system features quasi-transitive climate conditions, where long transients can be observed.

Set-up of long simulations for varying solar constant

While the studies in [\cite=Lucarini2010a] [\cite=Boschi2013] were focused on the thermodynamic properties of the model solutions along the two branches of statistical steady-state, we here focus on the changes in the characteristic evolution of statistics (cf. section [\ref=sec:specTransfer]) along the warm branch as the solar constant S is decreased to its critical value Sc  =  1263(Wm- 2). The method presented in section [\ref=sec:approxSpectrum] requires very long time series of observables. The model is hence ran for 10,000 years in the configuration presented section [\ref=sec:PlaSim] and for 12 different fixed values of the solar constant, ranging from the critical value Sc to 1360 ~ (Wm- 2) (approximately the present day value).

The initial state of each simulation is taken in the basin of attraction of the warm state. While this is difficult to guarantee, taking as initial state the annual mean of the 100th year of a simulation for a solar constant as high as 1450  ~  (Wm- 2) (i.e for which only the warm state exists) resulted in the convergence to the warm state for each of the 14 values of S. A spin-up of 200 years was more than enough for the simulations to converge to the statistical steady-state (facilitated by the fact that the ocean has no dynamics). Preparing for the analysis of section [\ref=sec:results], this spin-up period was removed from the time series. The time series for each observable is subsequently sub-sampled from daily to annual averages, in order to focus on interannual-to-multidecadal variability and to avoid having to deal with the seasonal cycle.

Transfer operators and their approximation

In this section, we shortly review (i) the connection between the spectrum of the transfer operator and correlations and (ii) the computational approach to determine approximations of this spectrum.

Spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators and decay of correlations

We consider a dissipative dynamical system (DDS) governed by the system of ODEs

[formula]

where [formula] is the phase space and F:X  →  X is a smooth vector field with flow {Φτ}τ  ≥  0.

Instead of focussing on individual trajectories, one can also follow the evolution of probability distributions over which observables can be averaged. This is what is done, for instance, when meteorologists or climate scientists run an ensemble simulation for which the members differ only in their slightly different initial conditions. As time evolves, the ensemble spreads more and more over the phase space (i.e. mixes) until each member becomes decorrelated from the others and averages taken over the ensemble converge to a constant value. From the conservation of probabilities in phase space, the evolution of a distribution f by the flow is governed by the Liouville equation:

[formula]

The infinitesimal (linear) operator A generates a one-parameter semigroup [\cite=Engel2001] of transfer operators {Lτ}τ  ≥  0 yielding the evolution of initial distributions after a finite time τ. Formally, taking an observable g in a smooth space D and a distribution f in the dual space D', the semigroup of transfer operators can be defined, by duality, as such

[formula]

where [formula] is the action of the linear functional f on the smooth test function g, depending on their functional spaces. In particular, taking f and g in ([\ref=eq:adjoint]) in spaces of integrable functions, such as L1μ(X) and L∞μ(X), respectively, provides the definition of the correlation function [\cite=Lasota1994]

[formula]

where the product of the averages of f and g is determined w.r.t to the measure μ. The first term in ([\ref=eq:ccf]) can also be understood as the average of g, as time evolves, with respect to an initial density f. For mixing systems, as illustrated with the example of the ensemble simulation above, with unique invariant measure μ, the correlation function converges to 0 with time. This means that Lτf converges weakly to μ [\cite=Lasota1994].

Of particular interest is the spectrum of the generator A, which we refer to as the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators in the following. Because this operator is infinite dimensional, its spectrum depends on the functional spaces chosen and may not only contain discrete eigenvalues, but also a continuous part. In this study, we focus on dissipative systems (for which the phase space contracts on average, indicative of positive entropy production, which can result in the fractal structure of the attractor, see [\cite=Eckmann1985] [\cite=Strogatz1994]) and the relevant eigenvectors are in spaces of distributions (in the Schwartz sense). In particular, for mixing systems, the first eigenvalue is simple and equal to 0 and its eigenvector is the invariant physical measure or statistical steady-state (meaning that the time average of smooth observables converges to their average w.r.t. the invariant measure, for an initial set of positive Lebesgue measure), while the rest of the spectrum is to the left of the imaginary axis.

It has been shown in [\cite=Butterley2007] that, for Anosov flows, there exists a strip [formula] in the complex plane, in which only discrete eigenvalues λi of finite multiplicity are to be found. In the following, we will assume that this is the case, again supported by the chaotic hypothesis [\cite=Gallavotti1995] [\cite=Gallavotti2014]. We furthermore assume, for convenience, that the discrete spectrum is composed of n simple eigenvalues {λi}1  ≤  i  ≤  n. The spectral decomposition of the generator then gives for the correlation function

[formula]

where ψi and ψ*i are the eigenvectors of the generator and its adjoint, respectively, associated with the eigenvalue λi and [formula] is the spectral projection of f on the continuous part of the spectrum applied to g [\cite=Butterley2015]. Note also that, from the Spectral Mapping Theorem for strongly continuous semigroups (SMT, see [\cite=Engel2001]), eλit is equal to the eigenvalue ζi(τ) of the transfer operator Lτ (with same eigenvector ψi and adjoint eigenvector ψ*i).

The first term in the sum of ([\ref=eq:ccfDecomp]) is associated with the eigenvalue 0, which is unique for mixing systems, and cancels out with the product of the averages [formula]. Furthermore, since the {λi}2  ≤  i  ≤  n have negative real parts, the contribution of each secondary eigenvalue in the decomposition decays exponentially fast. Eigenvalues closer to the imaginary axis are, however, responsible for a slower decay, resulting in bumps in the correlation spectrum (i.e. the Fourier transform of the correlation function) at a frequency given by the imaginary part of the eigenvalue. The amplitude of the bumps depend on how f and g project on the eigenvectors ψ*i and ψi, respectively [\cite=Chekroun2014]. From these considerations, one would expect the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators of a system undergoing a critical slowing down (i.e. a slow decay of correlations) to accumulate at the imaginary axis. This has indeed been shown to be the case for the normal forms of the pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations [\cite=Gaspard1995] [\cite=Gaspard2001a] and we will investigate this here for a chaotic attractor crisis.

Approximation of the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators

As mentioned in the introduction, it has been shown that the discrete spectrum of transfer operators (of smooth uniformly hyperbolic systems) acting on Banach spaces is stable to perturbations [\cite=Gouezel2006] [\cite=Butterley2007]. These stability results justify the use of numerical schemes [\cite=Froyland2007a] such as Ulam's method to approximate transfer operators by transition matrices acting on a discrete space such as a grid spanned by characteristic functions. Each element of these matrices is a transition probability from one grid-box to the other, which can be estimated from simulations [\cite=Dellnitz1999a]. Such method has successfully been applied to low-dimensional systems such as Chua's ciruit [\cite=Dellnitz1997a] or the Lorenz system [\cite=Froyland2009]. For high-dimensional systems, however, Ulam's method becomes prohibitive, as the size of the grid grows exponentially with the dimension (for an equivalent refinement).

To overcome this curse of dimensionality, it has recently been suggested in [\cite=Chekroun2014] to approximate transfer operators by transition matrices on a reduced, low-dimensional phase space Y defined by an appropriately chosen observable h:X  →  Y. As for Galerkin approximations, the reduced phase space is discretised into a grid of boxes {Bi}1  ≤  i  ≤  m (another type discretisation could also be used) and the elements of the transition matrix Phτ at a lag τ and for the observable h, are estimated from a long time series {xk}1  ≤  k  ≤  T of the system by

[formula]

The hats in the formula are there to remind that the (P̂hτ)ij's are only likelihood estimators of the true transition probabilities (Phτ)ij.

Note that because of the high-dimensionality, it is not possible to estimate the transition probabilities from many simulations starting from different initial conditions seeding the phase space. Instead, taking advantage of the ergodicity of the invariant measure implied by the mixing property, only one long simulation is used which, after an initial spin-up, evolves arbitrarily close to the attractor (in fact, several simulations starting from a different initial state could also be used, facilitating the numerical implementation of the method). Thus, unless, for instance, some noise is added to perturb the system away from the attractor, only transitions corresponding to motions along the attractor will be resolved. This is an important remark as critical slowing down may well be only visible when the system is pushed away from the statistical steady-state (for instance, in the case of a stable fixed point or periodic orbit). However, as will be shown in section [\ref=sec:results], critical slowing down can also be detected through spontaneous fluctuations (due to instabilities) on the chaotic attractor.

Once the transition matrix Phτ has been estimated for an observable h and a lag τ, its l leading eigenvalues {hi(τ)}1  ≤  i  ≤  l can be calculated. Applying the SMT, the complex logarithm of these eigenvalues divided by τ is taken to give

[formula]

The {λ̂hi(τ)}1  ≤  i  ≤  l are the leading eigenvalues that the generator would have if P̂hτ was the true transfer operator Lτ. These eigenvalues should be independent of the lag τ, but because the transition matrices are estimated on a reduced phase space Y, {P̂hτ}τ  ≥  0 do not constitute a semigroup and transition matrices estimated for different lags can yield different {λ̂hi(τ)}1  ≤  i  ≤  l, as is stressed by the addition of the argument τ. Indeed, the projection of the dynamics on a reduced phase space introduces memory effects, violating the Markov property of the original system (see Mori-Zwanzig formalism in [\cite=Zwanzig2001] [\cite=Chorin2002]). The importance of the choice of the lag τ was already pointed out in [\cite=Tantet2015], where the method has been applied to the study of atmospheric regime transitions. As a rule of thumb, a shorter lag allows to access to shorter time scales but a longer lag allows to treat the fast unresolved variables as decorrelated noise.

While the quality of the approximation of the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators by the spectrum of transition matrices depends on the choice of the observable h, it has been proven in [\cite=Chekroun2014] that the transition probabilities between two sets in the reduced phase space Y correspond exactly to transition probabilities between the pre-images of these sets in the full phase space X. Thus, it is expected that the leading eigenvalues of the transfer operators can be approximated by the spectrum of transition matrices in the reduced phase space as long as the observable h is appropriately chosen so as to project significantly on the slowest decaying vectors (the eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues closest to the imaginary axis).

Results

The long simulations described in section [\ref=sec:simulations] are now used to study the statistical changes occurring along the warm branch of statistical steady-states as the solar constant is decreased towards its critical value Sc. Before applying the methods presented in section [\ref=sec:methodology], it is first of all shown that critical slowing down can be observed before the crisis. Note that we have discarded all results relative to values of the solar constant smaller than 1265(Wm- 2), because the sea-ice cover (a discontinuous observable) becomes very sensitive to the spatial resolution of the model close to criticality. This results in spurious meta-stable states with different number of grid boxes covered by sea ice.

Changes in the statistical steady-state

We start by discussing the statistics of a few observables to stress their key role in the ice-albedo feedback, the instability mechanism responsible for the attractor crisis (see section [\ref=sec:crisisPlasim]). Based on physical grounds, the following observables will be used:

the global fraction of Sea Ice Cover (SIC) in the Northern Hemisphere (NH),

the Mean Surface Temperature (MST) averaged around the Equator (Eq, i.e. from [formula] to [formula]),

The SIC is the primary variable involved in the ice-albedo feedback as an ice-covered ocean has a much bigger albedo than an ice-free ocean. Sea ice forms when the surface temperature is below the freezing point (Tf  ≈  271.8K) motivating the choice of a surface temperature indicator. Furthermore, the MST at the equator is an indicator of the amount of heat stored in the ocean at low-latitudes (indeed, because the ocean is slab, the temperature of the water column is uniform and proportional to its heat content) and that can potentially be transported to high latitudes through horizontal diffusion in the Ocean or, indirectly, through the general circulation of the Atmosphere.

The sample mean (from the long simulations) of these observables are represented in figure [\ref=fig:moments](a-b), allowing us to recap the changes in the climate steady-state [\cite=Lucarini2010a] [\cite=Boschi2013]. As the solar constant is decreased, less thermal Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) is necessary to balance the Incoming Shortwave Radiation (ISR) from the sun, so that, as predicted by the Stefan-Boltzmann law of black bodies, the temperature of the Earth cools down, explaining the decrease in the Eq MST (fig. [\ref=fig:moments](b)). The cooling of the surface of the Earth induces an increase of the extent of the sea ice towards low latitudes, further weakening the amount of absorbed solar radiation and strengthening the cooling. These changes in the mean of these observables are smooth, almost linear. Only for a value of the solar constant smaller than 1280(Wm- 2) does the increase in NH SIC strengthen.

However, the sample variance (fig. [\ref=fig:moments](c-d)) and skewness (fig. [\ref=fig:moments](e-f)) experience rougher changes with the solar constant. Indeed, the variance of the NH SIC and Eq MST increases dramatically for S  <  1300(W / m2). This increase indicates that the ice-albedo feedback is less and less damped as the criticality is approached. Thus, an anomaly in, for instance, the surface temperature can lead to an increase in the SIC which will be less easily damped by heat transport from a cooler equator. To stress the relationship between the NH SIC and the Eq MST, their joint Probability Density Function (PDF, calculated from the first eigenvector of the transition matrices estimated in the next section [\ref=sec:resultSpectrum], yielding exactly the same results as binned estimates, see [\cite=Tantet2015]) is plotted figure [\ref=fig:PDFJOINT], for decreasing values of the solar constant. Apart from the changes in the mean and the increase in the variance (the axis of each panel have the same scaling), these plots show that while for S  =  1300(Wm- 2) (panel (a)) the NH SIC and Eq MST are not correlated and normally distributed, their distribution becomes more and more tilted and skewed as the solar constant is decreased (panel (b-d)). This increase in the skewness of the NH SIC and Eq MST is also visible figure [\ref=fig:moments](e-f) from which one can verify that positive values of the NH SIC and negative values of the Eq MST are favoured as the criticality is approached. This asymmetry is in agreement with the fact that as the ice-albedo feedback is less and less damped, larger excursions of the SIC to low latitudes and concomitant cooler temperatures are permitted.

Critical slowing down

Section [\ref=sec:moments] revealed the changes in the moments of the steady-state along the warm branch, which could be linked to the physical mechanism of ice-albedo feedback. We now show that, consistent with the increase in variance and skewness of the NH SIC and Eq MST, their decorrelation time also increases. For this purpose, the sample Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) of these observables are calculated from the simulations presented in section [\ref=sec:simulations] and shown in figure [\ref=fig:ACF]. Note that, because the NH SIC and Eq MST are mostly anti-correlated, the absolute value of the CCF between NH SIC and the Eq MST is plotted in figure [\ref=fig:ACF](c).

From the rather piecewise linear dependence of the correlation functions with the lag, we observe that the decay of the correlation functions is in qualitative agreement with a sum of exponentials, as formulated in ([\ref=eq:ccfDecomp]). The fact that the correlation functions in figure [\ref=fig:ACF] show different decay rates depending on the choice of the observables is indicative that these observables project differently on the eigenvectors of the generator of the semigroup of transfer operators and its adjoint, predicted by ([\ref=eq:ccfDecomp]). For example, that the auto-correlation functions for the NH SIC (fig. [\ref=fig:ACF].a) decay more slowly that the auto-correlation functions for the Eq MST (fig. [\ref=fig:ACF].b) suggests that the NH SIC projects more strongly on the part of the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators close to the imaginary axis than the Eq MST. Furthermore, no oscillatory behavior is found in the correlation functions, indicative that the leading rates in the exponentials must be real. Note also the strong correlations between the NH SIC and the Eq MST figure [\ref=fig:ACF](c), in agreement with the PDFs of figure [\ref=fig:PDFJOINT]. Most importantly, the correlation functions decay more and more slowly as the solar constant is decreased towards its critical value.

Critical slowing down is thus apparent before the attractor crisis in this model, even when the unperturbed evolution of the system alone is observed (i.e., from time series converged to the attractor). This result can be explained in physical terms by the fact that, as the criticality is approached, spontaneous fluctuations, such as a temperature anomalies caused by instabilities in the atmosphere, are able to trigger the ice-albedo feedback. Mathematically, the slowing down and the chaotic attractor crisis cannot simply be understood in terms of a Lyapunov exponent becoming positive, as in [\cite=Gaspard1995] [\cite=Gaspard2001a] for the normal forms of the pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations. Indeed, estimates in [\cite=Schalge2013] suggest that the dynamical core of PlaSim possesses many positive Lyapunov exponents. As will be discussed in section [\ref=sec:discussion], the slowing down can be explained by the approach of the stable manifold of a repeller colliding with the attractor at the crisis.

Changes in the spectrum of transfer operators

The theory presented in section [\ref=sec:specTransfer] suggests that the slowing down observed before the attractor crisis can be explained by the approach of the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators towards the imaginary axis. To test this theory here, we apply the numerical method presented in section [\ref=sec:approxSpectrum] and estimate transition matrices from the time series of the NH SIC and the Eq MST, observables selected for being most sensitive to the slowing down (cf. fig. [\ref=fig:ACF]) and most relevant in terms of ice-albedo feedback (see section [\ref=sec:moments]).

We first consider a one dimensional reduced phase space defined from the NH SIC or the Eq MST alone. A grid of 50 boxes spanning the interval

Summary and Discussion

Motivated by the question whether critical slowing down can be observed in a chaotic system undergoing an attractor crisis and whether this slowing down can be explained in terms of spectrum of operators governing the dynamics of statistics, we have taken as test bed a high-dimensional chaotic climate model undergoing a change of attractor as a control parameter is varied.

Correlation functions estimated from long simulations of the model have revealed that a slowing down indeed occurs as the critical value of the control parameter is approached. Importantly, the slowing down could be seen from the evolution of observables in steady-state, without having to perturb the system away from the attractor. This could be explained in physical terms by the fact that the primary mechanism of instability leading to the destruction of the attractor, the ice-albedo feedback, is not only activated by exogenous perturbations but also by spontaneous fluctuations along the attractor (i.e., internal variability, in climatic jargon). This aspect, related to the presence of positive Lyapunov exponents associated with unstable processes, makes the treatment of deterministic chaotic systems intrinsically more interesting than that of simpler systems featuring fixed points or periodic orbits as attractors.

The topological explanation of this phenomenon is less straightforward, but the study in [\cite=Bodai2013] suggests that the observed critical slowing down could be related to the approach of the attractor by a repeller, eventually leading to the crisis. They show that in a simple, yet physically relevant, energy model able to reproduce accurately the snowball/snowfree bistability system the attractor crisis is due to the collision of the attractor of the warm steady-state with a repelling invariant set (the so-called "edge state"). Such mechanism has been extensively described in [\cite=Grebogi1983] for low-dimensional systems such as the Hénon map or the Lorenz flow and also in [\cite=Schneider2007] for high-dimensional hydrodynamic flows. In these studies, several attractors coexist for a large range of parameter values, as in PlaSim, and it is shown that their basins of attraction are separated by the stable manifold of a repeller, while the closure of the unstable manifold of the repeller lies on the attractors (the simplest example of this situation would be two stable fixed points separated by a saddle node). Furthermore, as the control parameter is varied towards its critical value one of the attractors gets dangerously close to the stable manifold of the repeller, eventually colliding with it at the crisis. There, one of the attractors is destroyed and becomes part of the basin of attraction of the other.

Recently the edge state has been constructed also for a simplified climate model incorporating the dynamical core of PlaSim and a simplified representation of the oceanic transport and of the ice-albedo feedback [\cite=Lucarini2015c]. For this case, the above mentioned mechanism of attractor crisis has been confirmed in detail. We are therefore led to think that the edge state exists also in the PlaSim configuration adopted here. The critical slowing down observed at the approach of the crisis could thus be explained by the influence of the stable manifold of the edge state on the dynamics on the attractor. Indeed, trajectories along the attractor approaching the region in which the stable manifold of the edge state is close are expected to spend more and more time in this region, resulting in an increase of the correlations (and thus of predictability). Note that understanding the properties of the edge state is key to predicting the features of the noise induced transitions across the two basins of attractions.

The second step of this study was to verify that the slowing down of the decay of correlations can be described in terms of spectrum of transfer operators, relying on approximations by Markov transition matrices acting on a reduced phase space. Approximating this spectrum for systems with competing time-scales can reveal much reacher dynamics than by the estimation of the decorrelation rates alone. Of course, one cannot expect to recover the discrete part of the spectrum of transfer operators very accurately with such coarse-grained representations. However, with an appropriate choice of observable one can expect to get good estimates of the leading eigenvalues. The observable should be such that it projects well on the leading eigenvectors of the semigroup of transfer operators. However, these eigenvectors are difficult to access and the choice of the observable should eventually be guided by the behaviour of its correlation functions and by an understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms responsible for the slow dynamics. Moreover, if the reduced phase space on which the transition matrices are estimated is defined by an observable which is such that its correlation functions decay slowly, unresolved fluctuations (i.e orthogonal to the reduced phase space) are more likely to experience a correlation decay faster than the observable itself and could thus be approximated by a decorrelated noise. In this case, the evolution of the observable could be modelled by a stochastic process on the reduced phase space and the evolution of densities in this space would itself be governed by the semigroup of transfer operators of the stochastic process (see [\cite=Tantet2015] for a detailed discussion).

Contrary to the changes in the statistical moments of observables (cf. section [\ref=sec:moments]), which are expected to vary depending on the topology of the attractor, the approach of the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators to the imaginary axis responsible for the slowing down as an attractor crisis is approached is expected to be rather general. It is based on both the physical idea that the instability mechanism becomes more and more easy to trigger by spontaneous fluctuations along the chaotic attractor and on the discussion on the collision with an edge state. In fact the narrowing of the spectral gap between the eigenvalue 0 and the secondary eigenvalues of the semigroup is an indicator that the radius of convergence of the series expansion of the perturbed invariant measure shrinks [\cite=Kato1995] [\cite=Lucarini2015b]. In other words, the size of the perturbation for which response theory applies [\cite=Ruelle2009] vanishes at the criticality, accordingly to the fact that a dramatic change in the statistics occurs during the attractor crisis.

Finally, we have seen in section [\ref=sec:resultSpectrum], that the change in the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators (and, a fortiori, in the decorrelation rates) is very smooth before the crisis, in agreement with the analytical results in [\cite=Gaspard1995] [\cite=Gaspard2001a] for low-dimensional systems. Invoking the chaotic hypothesis, such numerical results could be explained by the differentiability of the spectrum of Anosov systems, proved in [\cite=Gouezel2006] for appropriate Banach spaces. The fact that critical slowing down can be observed from long time series of a high-dimensional chaotic system suggests that classical early warning indicators such as the lag-1 autocorrelation [\cite=Held2004a], could be used to detect a chaotic attractor crisis from observations. However, the smoothness in the change of the spectrum of the semigroup of transfer operators suggests that autocorrelation-based indicators cannot be expected to give a very strong signal at the approach of an attractor crisis. This analysis thus shows, that even though the methodology presented section [\ref=sec:methodology] is too demanding in terms of data to apply it to observations and use the spectral gap as an early-warning indicator of a crisis, it is very well suited to understand and design such indicators in the more general context of high-dimensional chaotic (and also stochastic) systems than the one of AR(1) processes for which the lag-1 auto-correlation indicator was originally developed in [\cite=Held2004a].

Robustness of the numerical estimates of the spectrum of the reduced transition matrices

In this section, we test the robustness of the eigenvalues of the reduced transition matrices represented figure [\ref=fig:ratesW2SB] to the sampling length, the grid size and the lag. For convenience, all the tests are presented for the NH SIC only. However, the corresponding tests done for the Eq MST and (NH SIC, Eq MST) do not challenge the conclusions taken in this study. Unless specified, all the parameters used in the following to estimate the transition matrices, such as the length of the times series, the grid, or the lag, are taken the same as for the ones used section [\ref=sec:resultSpectrum] to produce figure [\ref=fig:ratesW2SB].

Robustness to the sampling length

To test the robustness of the approximated spectra to the length of the time series used to estimate the transition probabilities, one could calculate confidence intervals from a version of the non-parametric bootstrap (see [\cite=Efron1982a] [\cite=Mudelsee2010]), adapted to the estimation of transition matrices (see [\cite=Craig2002a]) as was done in [\cite=Chekroun2014] [\cite=Tantet2015]. Instead, we simply look at the changes in the real part of the leading eigenvalues of the transition matrices when only the first half (4850 years) or quarter (2425 years) of the time series is used. The thus obtained real parts of the leading eigenvalues of transition matrices calculated for the NH SIC, with a lag of 1 year and on a grid of 50 boxes, are represented figure [\ref=fig:robustLength]. Furthermore, the inverse of the real part of the second eigenvalue is catalogued in the third and fourth column of table [\ref=tab:robust].

It is sufficient for this analysis to see, by comparing figure [\ref=fig:ratesW2SB] to figure [\ref=fig:robustLength] and from table [\ref=tab:robust], that using time series of NH SIC twice or even four times as short as the original one to estimate the transition probabilities results in errors of less than 10% in the inverse of the real part of the eigenvalues. This shows the convergence of the estimates with the length of the time series, and that the qualitative picture, of the approach of the eigenvalues to the imaginary axis as the attractor crisis is neared, is not affected by the sampling length.

Robustness to the grid size

The robustness of our results to the size of the grid is now addressed. Figure [\ref=fig:robustGrid](a) to (c) represents the real part of the leading eigenvalues of transition matrices estimated on a grid of 25, 75 or a 100 boxes, respectively, instead of the original grid of 50 boxes used to produce figure [\ref=fig:ratesW2SB]. Figure [\ref=fig:robustGrid](a-c) and figure [\ref=fig:ratesW2SB] are qualitatively similar, with the approach to 0 of the real part of the leading eigenvalues as the solar constant is decreased. The inverse of the real part of the second eigenvalue is also given in the fifth to the seventh column of table [\ref=tab:robust] from which one can see that increasing the resolution results in differences in the inverse of the real part of the second eigenvalue of less than 5%. This suggests that the grid of 50 boxes used for the NH SIC is sufficiently thin to obtain good estimates of, at least, the second eigenvalue, allowing one to conclude that the outcome of this study is not challenged by the coarse resolution of the grid used to estimate the transition matrices.

Robustness to the lag

All the transition matrices in section [\ref=sec:resultSpectrum] were calculated for a lag of 1 year, in order to have access to time scales as short as possible. However, due to the fact that the transition matrices are calculated on a reduced phase space, {Phτ}τ  ≥  0 does not constitute a semigroup, so that the SMT does not apply and the eigenvalues {λ̂hi(τ)}1  ≤  i  ≤  l depend on the lag for which the transition matrix has been estimated. To verify that the conclusions of the analysis presented section [\ref=sec:resultSpectrum] are not questioned by a different choice of the lag, we represent, in figure [\ref=fig:robustLag](a) and (b), the real part of the leading secondary eigenvalues, calculated, as for figure [\ref=fig:ratesW2SB], for the NH SIC and on a grid of 50 boxes but for a longer lag of 3 and 5 years, respectively. Again, the inverse of the real part of the first secondary eigenvalue thus obtained is catalogued in table [\ref=tab:robust].

It is obvious from figure [\ref=fig:robustLag], that eigenvalues far away from the imaginary axis are not well estimated for long lags as they are cornered to some cut-off value. This effect is expected, since the lag used to estimate the transition matrices gives a lower bound to the time scale associated with the eigenvalues that the method presented in section [\ref=sec:approxSpectrum] can resolve. However, even when a lag of 5 years is taken, the approach of the second eigenvalue to the imaginary axis as the control parameter is decreased towards its critical value can still be observed figure [\ref=fig:robustLag](b), since the real part of this eigenvalue corresponds to a time scale larger than 5 years for S  <  1280(Wm- 2).
