Visible lattice points and the chromatic zeta function of a graph

Introduction

Two distinct points X,Y of the s-dimensional integer lattice are said to be mutually visible if the line segment joining them contains no other lattice point. We denote this situation by [formula]. It is well known [\cite=Ch] that if X,Y are lattice points taken at random uniformly in s then [formula] as n  →    ∞  , where ζ(s) is the classical Riemann zeta function. Since [formula] and [formula] are independent events, then [formula]. What about [formula]? In other words, what is the probability that the three edges of a random triangle X,Y,Z contains no other lattice points than their vertices?

At first sight, we could expect that [formula] since apparently the three events, [formula], are independent events. We prove that this intuition is not correct. In fact we obtain a more general result.

Let s,k  ≥  2 positive integers. If [formula] are lattice points taken uniformly at random in s, we have

[formula]

The repetition of vertices Xi is allowed in Theorem [\ref=main]. However, the probability of these degenerate cases tends to zero as n  →    ∞  , so we could have formulated Theorem [\ref=main] saying that [formula] are distinct lattice points.

It is interesting to note that the value of the limit in Theorem [\ref=main] is smaller than ζ- k(s) when k is odd and greater than ζ- k(s) when k is even. We do not understand the reason of this phenomenom.

The following version of Theorem [\ref=main] can be more illustrative. Take a lattice point X1 at random. Then take a random lattice point X2 visible from X1, then take a random lattice point X3 visible from X2 and so on. What is the probability that Xk is visible from X1? Corollary [\ref=cor], which is a trivial consequence of Theorem [\ref=main], answers this question.

Let s,k  ≥  2 positive integers. If [formula] are lattice points taken uniformly at random in s we have

[formula]

Again, we see that [formula] is smaller than [formula] when k is odd and greater when k is even. Theorem [\ref=main] can be extended to more general configurations.

Given a graph H of order k we say that that a sequence of lattice points [formula] is H-visible if [formula] whenever {i,j}∈E(H).

Our main Theorem is the following.

Let s,k  ≥  2 positive integers and H a graph of order k. If [formula] are lattice points taken uniformly at random in s then we have

[formula]

where ζH(s) is the chromatic zeta function of H defined by

[formula]

where PH is the chromatic polynomial of H.

If we consider the linear graph H = Lk, with chromatic polynomial PLk(x) = x(x - 1)k - 1, we have that ζH(s) = ζk - 1(s) and we recover the classic result [\cite=Ch]:

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=main] follows from Theorem [\ref=main2] by taking the cycle of k vertices, H = Ck, and observing that PCk(x) = (x - 1)k + ( - 1)k(x - 1):

[formula]

David Rearick [\cite=R] considered a related problem. Given a set [formula] of m mutually visible lattice points, he studied the probability that a random lattice point in s is visible from all the lattice points of Sm. He proved that

[formula]

if m < 2s and 0 if m  ≥  2s. In particular [\eqref=R] implies that if m < 2s and [formula] are taken uniformily at random in s, then

[formula]

This result can be obtained easily from Theorem [\ref=main2] considering the chromatic polynomials of the complete graphs, [formula], and observing that

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2]

Given two lattice points [formula] and [formula] we write [formula] if [formula] for all [formula]. We write [formula] otherwise.

Given a prime p, we say that [formula] is Hp-visible if [formula] whenever {i,j}∈E(H). The first observation is that

[formula]

For any positive integer M and n > M we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We split R in two sets: [formula]. The set R1 contains those [formula] with Xi = Xj for some i  ≠  j and R2 contains those with all Xi distinct.

Clearly,

[formula]

On the other hand we observe that if Xi  ≠  Xj then [formula] for p  ≥  n, so [formula] is always Hp-visible when p  ≥  n for those [formula] counted in R2. Indeed, for a fixed [formula] the number of [formula] such that [formula] is (n / p + O(1))s  ≪  ns / ps for p < n. Thus,

[formula]

and we get the upper bound

[formula]

By [\eqref=ss], [\eqref=aa] and [\eqref=M] we have

[formula]

The next step is to estimate the quantity

[formula]

A good coloration of a labeled graph H is an assigment of colours to the vertices such that two adjacents vertices do not share the same colour. The polynomal chromatic PH(x) counts the number of good colorations of H using x colours.

For each p we assign to each vertex [formula] the p-colour cp(X) defined as the only vector cp(X)∈[0,p  -  1]s such that [formula].

We observe that [formula] if and only if there exists a good p-coloration [formula] of H such that [formula] Thus, [formula] for any p  ≤  M if and only if there exists a sequence of good colorations (Cp)p  ≤  M such that [formula] for all p  ≤  M.

Since for each prime p there are ps colours, the number of good p-colorations of H is PH(ps), where PH is the chromatic polynomial of H. Therefore, the number of sequences of good colorations (Cp)p  ≤  M is

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

where the sum [formula] is extended over all sequences of good colorations (Cp)p  ≤  M of the graph H.

Given a sequence of colorations [formula] we have that

[formula]

Given the vectors [formula], the lattice points [formula] with cp(X) = cip for all p  ≤  M will be those such that the congruences [formula] hold for any [formula]. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem these congruences are equivalent, for each [formula], to the congruence [formula] for some ar. The number of xr  ≤  n satisfying each congruence is [formula] so the number of X∈[1,n]s with cp(X) = cip for all p  ≤  M is

[formula]

Since this estimate does not depend on the values of cip we have

[formula]

Summing up, as consequence of [\eqref=pp1], [\eqref=pp2], [\eqref=pp3] and [\eqref=numbercolour] we obtain

[formula]

In terms of probability we have proved that

[formula]

Using [\eqref=sss] we have that

[formula]

Taking the limit as n  →    ∞   we get

[formula]

Finally, taking the limit as M  →    ∞   we have

[formula]
