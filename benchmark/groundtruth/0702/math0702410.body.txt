New polynomials producing absolute pseudoprimes with any number of prime factors

Introduction

A composite positive integer N is called the absolute pseudoprime if [formula] (mod N) for any integer a prime to N. This is also called the Carmichael number. The following criterion is essential:

Korselt's criterion. A composite odd positive integer N is the absolute pseudoprime if and only if N is squarefree and p - 1 divides N - 1 for every prime p dividing N.

From this, it easily follows that the number of prime divisors of the absolute pseudoprime is at least three.

In [\cite=AGP], Alford, Granville and Pomerance showed that there are infinitely many absolute pseudoprimes. Furthermore L ow and Niebuhr [\cite=LN] introduced a new algorithm for constructing absolute pseudoprimes with a large number of prime factors. However, it is still open that there are infinitely many k-component absolute pseudoprimes for each k  ≥  3. Hence we aim to produce many k-component absolute pseudoprimes. Furthermore it seems to be important to consider the polynomials producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors which is the product of distinct k linear polynomials such as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] (1  ≤  i  ≤  k) which satisfy the congruences [formula] (mod αim + βi - 1) for any [formula] (1  ≤  i  ≤  k). This has been already considered by Chernick [\cite=Ch]. Chernick called Uk(m) the universal form. For example, he constructed

[formula]

for [formula] with k  ≥  3. Indeed, if k  ≥  4 and m = 2k - 4M then Uk(2k - 4M) is a absolute pseudoprime when all factors in the right-hand side of ([\ref=ee-0]) are simultaneously prime numbers. He further gave a certain algorithm to construct a k-component universal form from a k-component absolute pseudoprime. However, by the Chernich method, it is impossible to construct many k-component universal forms because we cannot obtain even one k-component absolute pseudoprime for an arbitrary k.

From the viewpoint of what is called the k-tuple prime conjecture (see [\cite=CP] Chapter 1), it seem to be natural that Uk(m) produces infinitely many k-component absolute pseudoprimes. Furthermore Granville and Pomerance [\cite=GP] considered this deeply and gave the general theory about estimation of the number of k-component absolute pseudoprimes under the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture. As they mentioned in [\cite=GP] Section 2, it is sufficient to consider the case bi = 1 for each i in order to construct many k-component absolute pseudoprimes. Namely we consider the form

[formula]

We can see that ([\ref=ee-1]) produces k-component absolute pseudoprimes if Uk(m) satisfies the congruences [formula] (mod αim) for any [formula] (1  ≤  i  ≤  k). However they did not concretely construct k-component universal forms, namely polynomials producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors.

In the present paper, we give a certain sufficient condition that ([\ref=ee-1]) is a polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors (see Theorem [\ref=Th-1]). By this result, we construct the polynomial Uk,l(m) producing many absolute pseudoprimes which can be viewed as a generalization of Chernick's universal form ([\ref=ee-0]). In particular when l = 3, we see that Uk,3(m) coincides with ([\ref=ee-0]). Similarly, we give another type of polynomial Vk(m) producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors. As concrete examples, we tabulate the counts of such numbers by using the method similar to Dubner's one. Indeed, Dubner turned the method of Hardy and Littlewood precisely (see [\cite=HL]), and tabulated the counts of absolute pseudoprimes of the form U3,3(M) (see [\cite=Du]). We make use of his method, and tabulate the counts of absolute pseudoprimes of the form U4,4(M), U5,5(M) and W4(3M).

Polynomials producing many absolute pseudoprimes

First we give the following theorem.

Let [formula] with [formula] and r  ≥  3, which satisfy that

[formula]

Put

[formula]

for [formula] with k  ≥  r. Suppose [formula] with 2k - r - 1  |  m when k > r and [formula] is arbitrary when k = r, and put m = 2k - r - 1M (resp. m = M) when k > r (resp. k = r). Then [formula] [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors when k > r (resp. k = r).

First we prove the case where k = r. We can write [formula] as a polynomial in m of degree r. We immediately check that C0 = 1 and

[formula]

In particular, it follows from ([\ref=e-2]) that [formula]. From ([\ref=e-3]), we have [formula] (mod 2araj), namely

[formula]

Suppose μ  ≥  2. Considering each case when iμ < r and iμ = r, we obtain

[formula]

Since aj  |  2ar (1  ≤  j  ≤  r), we obtain [formula] (mod 2araj), namely

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=e-8]) and ([\ref=e-10]), we have

[formula]

Therefore [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes.

Secondly we assume k  ≥  r + 1. As well as the above argument, we write [formula]. From ([\ref=e-6]), we obtain D0 = 1 and

[formula]

where the sum [formula] is taken over all [formula] such that [formula] and all [formula] such that [formula].

In order to prove that [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes, we have only to prove that

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula].

When μ = 1, it follows from ([\ref=e-2]) that

[formula]

Hence, from ([\ref=e-3]), we have

[formula]

for [formula]. Hence ([\ref=e-12]) and ([\ref=e-13]) hold for μ = 1.

When μ  ≥  2, we have Hence we have [formula] (mod 4a2r). By ([\ref=e-3]), we see that ([\ref=e-12]) and ([\ref=e-13]) hold for μ  ≥  2. Thus [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors if k  ≥  r + 1.

If r - 1 strictly increasing natural numbers satisfy the condition

[formula]

then we can define ar by ([\ref=e-2]) and can get [formula] in the theorem, factoring out the GCD of [formula].

We consider the cases (r,k) = (4,5), (5,6) and (6,7). Then we can immediately give r-tuple sequences [formula] (r = 4,5,6) which satisfy ([\ref=e-2])-([\ref=e-4]), for example,

[formula]

Corresponding to these sequences, we can construct [formula] (k = 5,6,7) determined by ([\ref=e-6]), such as

[formula]

Furthermore we can construct certain classes of these forms as follows. Suppose [formula] with l  ≥  3. Then we can apply Theorem [\ref=Th-1] with r = l, a1 = 1, a2 = 2l - 2 and [formula], because the conditions ([\ref=e-2])-([\ref=e-4]) hold. For [formula] with k  ≥  l, we define [formula]. Then

[formula]

When k = l, then Uk,k(m) is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors. When k  ≥  l + 1, putting m = 2k - l - 1M, we see that [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes. Note that if l = 3 then Uk,3(m) coincides with the Chernick form ([\ref=ee-0]). When (k,l) = (4,4),  (5,5), we have

[formula]

By the same consideration as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Th-1], we give another polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes as follows. However, this form can not be derived from Theorem [\ref=Th-1] directly.

For k  ≥  3, we define

[formula]

When 3k - 3  |  m, putting m = 3k - 3M, we see that [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors. In order to prove this fact, we have only to check that

[formula]

Indeed, if we write [formula] then we can see that E0 = 1, E1 = 4  ·  3k - 1, and

[formula]

Hence we see that ([\ref=e-17]) and ([\ref=e-18]) hold and [formula] is the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with k prime factors. When k = 3, W3(m) coincides with Chernick's form (6m + 1)(12m + 1)(18m + 1). When k = 4, we have the polynomial producing many absolute pseudoprimes with 4 prime factors

[formula]

Numerical results

In [\cite=Du], Dubner turned the method of Hardy and Littlewood precisely (see [\cite=HL]) and constructed a function for estimating the count of absolute pseudoprimes of the form U3,3(m) = (6m + 1)(12m + 1)(18m + 1). We apply his method with U4,4, U5,5 and W4.

We recall Dubner's method to estimate the number of absolute pseudoprimes (see [\cite=Du] § 3). Denote by P(N) the probability of N being prime for [formula]. By the Prime Number Theorem, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, it follows from the Mertens theorem (see [\cite=HW] §  22.8) that

[formula]

First, we consider U4,4(m). Let u = q  ·  r  ·  s  ·  t, where q = 20m + 1, r = 80m + 1, s = 100m + 1 and t = 200m + 1. By the Prime Number Theorem, the probability of q being prime becomes

[formula]

because q is not divisible by 2 or 5. However, the primality of r is affected if q is prime, because q = 20m + 1 and r = 80m + 1, namely r = 4q - 3. Let p is a prime with [formula]. Then the condition that q is prime shows that [formula] (mod p). Under this condition, if r is prime then [formula] (mod p). This means that we need to consider the correction factor Cr(p) defined by

[formula]

When p = 3, the condition that q is prime shows that [formula] (mod 3). Hence we let Then the probability of r being prime becomes

[formula]

We see that 4s = 5r - 1. For a prime p with [formula], if [formula] (mod p) then [formula] (mod p), where 4- 1 is a inverse element of 4 mod p. Note that [formula] (mod p), since p > 5. Under the condition that both q and r are prime, if s is prime then [formula] (mod p). This means that we need to consider the correction factor Cs(p) defined by

[formula]

When p = 3, the condition that [formula] (mod 3) means that [formula] (mod 3) because 4s = 5r - 1. Under the condition, s is prime means [formula] (mod 3). So we let Then the probability of s being prime becomes

[formula]

Furthermore we see that t = 2s - 1. For a prime p with [formula], if [formula] (mod p) then [formula] (mod p). Note that [formula] (mod p), since p > 5. Under the condition that both q,r and s are prime, if t is prime then [formula] (mod p). This means that we need to consider the correction factor Cs(p) defined by

[formula]

When p = 3, the condition [formula] (mod 3) means [formula] (mod 3) because t = 2s - 1. Under the condition, t is prime means [formula] (mod 3). Hence we let Then the probability of s being prime becomes

[formula]

Hence the probability of q,r,s and t being prime simultaneously becomes

[formula]

Following Dubner's method introduced in [\cite=Du] Section 3, we consider

[formula]

which gives an estimate for the number of such absolute pseudoprimes with m  ≤  M for a given M. Define am by

[formula]

Then the estimate becomes

[formula]

Integrating by parts third times gives

[formula]

Note that the first term in the right-hand side of ([\ref=e-26]) can be calculated by using the well-known logarithmic integral function Li(x). By ([\ref=e-26]), we obtain the following table of theoretical count of U4,4(m). Note that N1(M) is the actual number of such absolute pseudoprimes with m  ≤  M.

Table 1: Count of U4,4(m)

Using the similar consideration, we can give an estimate for the number of absolute pseudoprimes of the form

[formula]

and of

[formula]

Corresponding to these forms, we let

[formula]

Then we obtain the following table of theoretical count of U5,5(m) and W4(3m), where N2(M) and N3(M) are the actual numbers of such absolute pseudoprimes with m  ≤  M.
