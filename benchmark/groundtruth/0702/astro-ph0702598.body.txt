SGR1806-20: evidence for a superstrong Magnetic Field from Quasi Periodic Oscillations

Introduction

Soft Gamma Repeaters are a small class of galactic sources of X and soft gamma radiation. They have spin periods of [formula] s, display a secular spin-down with timescales of [formula] yr and do not possess a companion. Unlike radio pulsars, the rotational energy loss of SGRs is a factor of [formula] too small to explain their persistent emission, typically [formula] erg/s (see e.g. [\citet=WooTho06]). Like Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXPs, [\citet=MeSte95]), with whom they share a number of properties, SGRs are believed to host magnetars, neutron stars the emission of which is powered by the decay of their superstrong (internal) magnetic field (B > 1015 G, [\citet=DT92] [\citet=TD93]).

The name-defining characteristic of SGRs is that they show periods of activity in which recurrent short bursts are emitted, with peak luminosities of [formula] ergs s- 1 and sub-second durations. The characteristics of the three giant flares observed so far in about 30 yr of monitoring are much more extreme. Their initial, tenths-of-seconds-long spike releases enormous amounts of energy, ~  1044 ergs in the 1979 March 5 event from SGR 0526-66 [\citep=Maz79] and the 1998 August 27 event from SGR 1900+14 [\citep=Hur99] [\citep=Fer99] and as much as 5  ×  1046 erg in the 2004 December 27 event from SGR1806-20 [\citep=Hur05] [\citep=Mere05] [\citep=Palm05] [\citep=Teras05]. After the initial spike, giant flares display a very bright ringing tail lasting hundreds of seconds and releasing a total energy of about ~  1044 ergs. The emitted spectrum is roughly thermal, with a blackbody equivalent temperature of ~  5 keV in the case of SGR1806-20 [\citet=Hur05].

The highly super-Eddington luminosities of the recurrent bursts of SGRs and especially of their giant flares make models involving accretion energy not viable. According to the magnetar model, the emission of SGRs (and AXPs) draws from their extremely high magnetic fields [\citep=TD95] [\citep=TD96] [\citep=TD01]. Within this model the neutron star interior is characterized by a wound-up, mainly toroidal magnetic field configuration with Bt > 1015 G. A less intense (mainly poloidal) field emerges out of the star magnetosphere, causing spin-down via rotating dipole losses at the observed rate [\citep=TD93] [\citep=TD01] (dipole B-field strength of Bd  ~  7.8  ×  1014 G). Energy propagates to the neutron star magnetosphere through Alfvén waves driven by local "crust-quakes" and giving rise to recurrent bursts with a large range of amplitudes. Large-scale rearrangements of the internal magnetic field or catastrophic instabilities in the magnetosphere are invoked to explain the sudden release of very large amounts of energy that occurs in giant flares [\citep=TD01] [\citep=Lyu03]. A fireball of plasma expanding at relativistic speeds breaks out of the star's magnetosphere, causing the initial sub-second spike of giant flares. The ringing tail that follows results most likely from the part of the fireball that remains trapped in the star's magnetosphere. The energy release in the ringing tail yields a limit for the external field of magnetars ([formula] G) in agreement with the values inferred from spin-down dipole losses [\citep=TD95] [\citep=TD01], while an analysis of the initial time scales gives evidence in favor of the crustal cracking mechanism [\citep=Sch05].

To confirm this model it is thus essential to measure the surface magnetic field, which complements the measurement of the dipole component ([\citet=Woo02]), to include higher order multipoles. In this paper we present an interpretation of the QPOs observed in SGR 1806-20 which provides a lower limit (B  ≫  Bq  ≈  4.4  ×  1013  G) to the surface field. The argument is based upon a seldom-used constraint ([\citep=CaRe78] [\citep=FaRe79] [\citep=Fab79]) that puts a very strong upper limit on the time-scale on which significant luminosity variations can take place. In the next section we discuss the relevant observations; in Section 3 we will re-derive the limit and show that it is largely violated by QPOs in SGR 1806-20; after vainly trying to circumvent it, we will show that it can be reconciled with observations only if B  ≫  Bq.

Quasi Periodic Oscillations in Giant Flares of SGRs

Recent studies led to the discovery that the X-ray flux of the ringing tail of SGRs' giant flares is characterized by fast Quasi Periodic Oscillations, QPOs [\citep=Isr05]. Different QPO modes were detected, some of which were excited simultaneously. The ringing tail of the December 2004 event from SGR 1806-20 displayed clear QPO signals at about 18, 30, 93, 150, 625 and 1840 Hz ([\citet=WaSt06]). Similarly, QPOs around frequencies of 28, 54, 84 and 155 Hz were detected during the ringing tail of the 1998 giant flare of SGR 1900+14 [\citep=StWa05], while hints for a signal at ~  43 Hz were found in the March 1979 event from SGR 0526-66 [\citep=Bar83]. These QPOs show large variations of the amplitude with time and, especially, of the phase of the spin modulation in the giant flare's tail.

The similarity in some of the QPO modes and frequencies across different SGRs suggests that the production mechanism is the same. A likely interpretation involves the excitation of neutron star oscillation modes, whose expected eigenfrequencies match some of the observed QPOs peaks ([\citep=Dun98] [\citep=Isr05] [\citep=Pir05]). Infact, if giant flares result from large scale fracturing of the crust induced by instabilities of the internal magnetic fields, then the excitation of crustal and (possibly) global neutron star modes is to be expected ([\citep=Lev06]). Regardless of the exact mechanism driving these oscillations we are concerned here with the extremely large and fast luminosity variations of the QPOs.

We concentrate on the signals with the largest luminosity time derivative, i.e. the 625 and 1840 Hz QPOs from SGR 1806-20 ([\citet=WaSt06]). The power spectrum peaks through which these QPOs are revealed, are a few Hz wide, testifying that their signal remained coherent for hundreds of cycles. The signal shape must be close to sinusoidal, as evidenced by the absence of detectable harmonic signals. The 625 and 1840 Hz QPOs were detected only in a ~  50 s long interval of the ringing tail, about 200 s after the initial spike, and were especially prominent over a ~  140 deg interval in rotational phase. The QPO amplitude reached a maximum in this phase interval over two consecutive rotation cycles: for both signals the rms amplitude was arms  ~  18%. Approximating the QPOs with sinusoids, we estimate their highest luminosity derivative as ΔL / Δt  =  23 / 2πLarmsνQPO, with νQPO the QPO frequency. Here L  ~  1041 ergs s- 1 is the luminosity in the relevant section of the ringing tail (for the likely source distance of 15  kpc). This gives ΔL / Δt  ~  1  ×  1044 and 3  ×  1044 ergs s- 2 for the 625 and 1840 Hz QPOs, respectively. The effects of beaming might decrease these values somewhat, but not by a very large factor. In fact, these QPO signals were observed over a large interval of rotational phases (about ~  140 deg), translating into approximately the same azimuthal range of emission angles. It is natural to assume a comparably large angular spread in latitude (unless the neutron star rotation axis is very close to our line of sight, which is unlikely given the large amplitude of the rotation modulation and the size of the emission region, see below). This gives a solid angle of order ~  π ster. Adopting this beaming factor the luminosity derivatives above reduce to ~  2  ×  1043 and 6  ×  1043 ergs s- 2; this are the values that we adopt in the following discussion.

We stress here, because this is essential to our argument (to be presented shortly), that, together with the QPOs, in the ringing tail a strong modulation at the star's spin period is clearly present, similar in relative amplitude and shape to the modulation observed when the source is in its quiescent state: this (together with the lack of significant amounts of beaming) indicates that the emission in the ringing tail originates from a region that remains stably anchored to the star's magnetosphere, and thus that relativistic bulk motions are not present at this stage of the flare.

The blackbody temperature and luminosity in the ringing tail translates into a lower limit on the size of the emitting region of about ~  30 km, i.e. substantially larger than the neutron star. On the other hand the black body-like spectral shape testifies that the emitting region is optically thick (or at least effectively thick), implying a scattering optical depth ≫  1. We remark that the size estimate, ≈  30  km, will play an important role in the following.

The Cavallo-Fabian-Rees Variability Limit

There is a well-known limit on the rate of change of the luminosity of any given source, which we briefly summarize here ([\citet=CaRe78] [\citet=FaRe79] [\citet=Fab79], see also [\citet=Law80] [\citet=Hos89]). Suppose a source undergoes a large luminosity variation on a time-scale Δt, and there is a luminosity variation, over this time-scale, ΔL. The total energy released within Δt is related to the total mass within the source dimension R by

[formula]

where n is the average baryon density, and η is the energy extraction efficiency. The time-scale Δt must obviously exceed the time over which the photons manage to diffuse out of the source:

[formula]

where τT  =  σTnR is the Thomson optical depth and σT the Thomson cross-section. Eliminating R from the first two equations, we find

[formula]

Regarded as a function of τT, the above has a minimum for τT  =  1, which yields the limit

[formula]

where ne is the electron number density, [formula] the plasma frequency, v  ≈  c the proton speed, and W  ≈  2E2p / (mec2) is the maximum energy transfer in the not too extreme limit, [formula] (but considering the opposite limit, [formula] would change the argument very little since W only appears as an argument to a logarithm).

The energy transfer timescale is of course [formula], which, for this whole idea to work, must be shorter than Δt. The condition tE  <  Δt can also be rewritten as, in the limit v2  ≈  c2:

[formula]

Inserting the numerical values for the luminosity of SGR 1806-20 during the ringing tail and for the typical magnetospheric density for a pulsar with a normal magnetic field we find

[formula]

In order to reconcile the CFR limit with observations, we need γ  ≈  30, corresponding to a magnetospheric density n  ≈  3  ×  1019  cm- 3. While it is certainly true that plasma outside pulsars need not be charge-separated, still this density would exceed the minimum (i.e., charge separated) value by more than 9 orders of magnitude, making it unlikely that such a plasma may exist.

This argument must be modified in the presence of a pair plasma, where pair creation processes can easily lead to a strong increase in [formula]. Still, we know that astrophysical pair plasmas are thermally regulated [\citep=PiKr95], so that their temperatures always lie around [formula]. At these temperatures, ne  ≈  1031  cm- 3, but we also know that Ep  ≪  mpc2, so that the limit of eq. [\ref=cavallo] still holds, provided the total energy density is still dominated by the rest mass of the baryons. When instead the total energy density is dominated by the pairs (in other words, when little or no baryons are admixed), eq. [\ref=timevar] obviously still holds (with τT now indicating the total optical depth due to the pairs and possibly to photons as well), while eq. [\ref=energycontent] must be rewritten as

[formula]

where we used the fact that γ  ≈  2 for the electrons. The new limit for the variability is

[formula]

A technical comment is in order at this point: the description of radiation transfer in terms of separate modal propagation is not always adequate ([\citet=Lai03]), because of mode collapse. However this effect seems to be mostly relevant for even higher fields ([formula]) than those derived here, which means that our naive treatment is probably justified.

We now remark that this lower limit applies to the field close to, but not at the surface of SGR 1806-20, because, as discussed in the previous section, emission from the ringing tail is generated within 30  km. At this distance from the star surface, the dipole field inferred from pulsar spin-down (B  =  7.8  ×  1014  G, [\citet=Woo02]), is 2.9  ×  1013  G(Rns / 10  km)3, which is smaller than the limit just derived, as expected if higher order multipoles are relevant in the star vicinity.

Given the rapid decrease of the dipole field (and a fortiori of the other multipoles) with distance from the star, the surface magnetic field must certainly satisfy

[formula]

where a dipole-like radial dependence has been assumed between 30  km and the star surface, located at Rns; we shall refrain from making more elaborate hypothesis about the structure of the magnetic field within R  =  30  km ([\citet=TD01]), because our aim is simply to provide a lower limit to the surface field, for which this minimum hypothesis (pure dipole) is fully adequate.

Discussion

Our final result is the lower limit in eq. [\ref=finallimit]. This value is close to that of the dipole field, as inferred from pulsar spin-down, B  =  7.8  ×  1014  G, but our estimate includes higher order multipoles, at least at 30  km. It is thus completely independent of the estimates from pulsar spin-down. We note that the limit on B derived by requiring that the magnetic field close to the star can prevent the escape of the "trapped fireball" includes also the contribution of higher multipole components ([\citet=TD01]), but gives a substantially lower magnetic field (B > 1014  G) than the limit derived above.

There is an easy way to test our interpretation of the failure of the CFR limit. The O- and E-mode photospheres of the trapped fireball are located at different heights in the star's magnetosphere, as a result of the different electron scattering cross sections, which therefore sample regions of different B-field strengths and orientations. The polarization fraction and angle of the emerging X-ray flux should thus be modulated with the phase of the QPO signal as a result of the varying (relative) intensity of the O- and E-mode photon component. This in principle gives a clear test for the correctness of our interpretation, which might perhaps become verifiable in the future.

Photons in the O-mode suffer a strong Comptonization ([\citet=TD01]). If the atmosphere were due to pure scattering, the ensuing photon distribution would differ from a blackbody at low photon frequency, [formula] instead of [formula], a result due to photon number conservation. At first sight, one might think that there are many processes which may lead to photon absorption and emission in a strong magnetic field, like photon splitting or pair creation via γ  +  B (resulting then in pair annihilation, and photon energy downgrading via Compton recoil), which make photon number conservation unlikely. At the same time, there are important radiation transfer effects taking place, which obviously tend to favor flatter spectra at low energies; also, all rates for photon emission and absorption depart from their values in the absence of magnetic field. Detailed computations ([\citep=Lyu02]) show that the ensuing spectrum is flatter, not steeper, than a blackbody; and we remark here that, despite many calibration uncertainties, fits to the spectrum seem to favor spectra flatter than a blackbody, with a preference for thermal bremsstrahlung of temperature T  =  30  keV.

We have presented our argument by stressing its independence from the estimates of the dipole field from pulsar spin-down, and from Thompson and Duncan's ([\citet=TD93] [\citet=TD95] [\citet=TD96]) model, but it should be obvious that the limit in eq. [\ref=finallimit] is perfectly consistent with the previous measurements, and the model itself.
