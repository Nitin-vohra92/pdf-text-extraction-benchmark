Asymptotic arbitrage and numéraire portfolios in large financial markets

Introduction

The notion of a large financial market as a sequence of the traditional market models with a finite number of risky assets (called stocks in the sequel), was introduced in [\cite=KabKra94]. It is assumed that in n-th small market the discounted stock prices are described by a vector semimartingale [formula], t∈[0,T(n)]. Any element of the set Xn of nonnegative value processes, generated by trading strategies, is as a sum of an initial non-random endowment and a stochastic integral with respect to Sn. The number d(n) of stocks as well as the planning horizon T(n) can increase to infinity as n  →    ∞  .

The notions of asymptotic arbitrage, introduced in [\cite=KabKra94], connected the results of modern arbitrage theory and the conclusions, obtained in the framework of Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, Lintner) and Arbitrage Pricing Model (Ross, Huberman): see [\cite=Shi99], [\cite=Kab01]. The present paper is aimed at further study of the conditions of asymptotic arbitrage of the first kind [\cite=KabKra94] and strong asymptotic arbitrage of the first kind [\cite=KabKra98]. In what follows, the term "first kind" is omitted since we do not consider asymptotic arbitrage of the second kind [\cite=KabKra94]. Another notions of arbitrage on a large market were introduced in [\cite=Kle00], [\cite=Ras03], [\cite=Kle06].

Following [\cite=KleSch96a], asymptotic arbitrage (resp., strong asymptotic arbitrage) can be interpreted as an opportunity of getting infinitely rich with positive probability (resp., with probability 1) by risking vanishing amount of money. Under the assumptions of no-arbitrage and completeness of the small markets it was proved in [\cite=KabKra94] that the condition of no asymptotic arbitrage (NAA) is equivalent to the contiguity of the sequence [formula] of original probability measures with respect to the unique sequence [formula] of equivalent local martingale measures. In the paper [\cite=KleSch96a] it was shown that if the small markets are incomplete then NAA condition is equivalent to the existence of some sequence [formula] with the same properties. Another proofs of this result were given in [\cite=KleSch96b], [\cite=KabKra98]. It was proved in [\cite=KabKra98] that the strong asymptotic arbitrage (SAA) is equivalent to the entire separation of the sequence [formula] and any sequence [formula] of equivalent local martingale measures.

Let us remember that, with some abuse of terminology, a value process 0 < Vn∈Xn is called the numéraire portfolio if any process Xn∈Xn, being expressed in the units of Vn, becomes a supermartingale. This notion in slightly narrow meaning (martingales instead of supermartingales) was introduced in [\cite=Lon90]. We refer to [\cite=Bec01], [\cite=PlaHea06], [\cite=Kar06], [\cite=ChrLar07], [\cite=Chr05] for the existence theorems and the properties of numéraire portfolios as well as for further references. The main theme of the present paper concerns the characterization of NAA and SAA conditions in terms of the sequence (Vn).

The numéraire portfolio possesses a number of optimality properties. Particulary, under some technical conditions, it maximizes the expected logarithmic utility and the correspondent supermartingale measure (or density process) minimizes the reverse relative entropy [\cite=Bec01]. So, the process Vn can be looked for as the solution of the correspondent optimization problem. In any case, Vn is uniquely defined [\cite=Bec01]. Thus the criteria proposed below are not purely existence results, but also computational tools for checking asymptotic arbitrage conditions.

Note that in the case of infinite time horizon a market with finite number of stocks can be regarded as "large" by representing it as a sequence of "small" markets with finite horizons [formula] and the same stocks. For such a market NAA condition is tantamount to the condition of no unbounded profit with bounded risk (NUPBR) [\cite=Kar06]. It was established in [\cite=Kar06] that NUPBR condition is equivalent to the existence of the non-exploding numéraire portfolio V, i.e. V∞ <  +   ∞  . Underlying the connection with the results of the present paper, one may say that the condition V∞ <  +   ∞   is imposed on the sequence (Vn) of the numéraire portfolios, which are the restrictions of V to

[formula]

Organization of the paper

In Sect. [\ref=sec:2] under minimal assumptions regarding the structure of the sets Xn, we prove that the realization of NAA and SAA conditions is completely determined by the behavior of the sequence (Vn). The correspondent criteria can be expressed in terms of contiguity, entire separation and Hellinger integrals, provided these notions are extended to sub-probability measures (Theorems [\ref=theo:1], [\ref=theo:2], [\ref=theo:3], [\ref=theo:4]).

The rest of the paper is devoted to more concrete market models. Although the results of Sect. [\ref=sec:2] are applicable to all of them, the specific features of these models deserve a separate study. In Sect. [\ref=sec:3] we consider a sequence of incomplete markets on finite probability spaces. Theorem [\ref=theo:5] contains the assertion about the equivalence of NAA condition to the contiguity of the sequence [formula] with respect to the sequence (n) of martingale measures, minimizing the reverse relative entropy. Likewise, SAA condition is equivalent to the entire separation of [formula] and (n).

The results of [\cite=KleSch96a], [\cite=KleSch96b], [\cite=KabKra98], cited above and concerning the semimartingale market models, are reproved in Sect. [\ref=sec:4]. Although these results are not contained in theorems of Sect. [\ref=sec:2], it is straightforward to give their proofs utilizing the mentioned theorems and the assertions of [\cite=KraSch99], [\cite=DelSch98], [\cite=KabStr01] regarding the structure of the set of supermartingale measures for Xn. This is done in Theorem [\ref=theo:6]. Criteria, linking NAA and SAA conditions to the sequence of optimization problems are given in Theorem [\ref=theo:7].

In Sect. [\ref=sec:5] we treat the diffusion market models. The obtained criteria (Theorem [\ref=theo:8]) are, in fact, of the same form as in [\cite=KabKra98]. However, the class of models under consideration is wider since we do not require the existence of local martingale measures in the small markets.

In Sect. [\ref=sec:6] we consider a market model with discrete time and infinite horizon. It is assumed that there is only one stock with independent log-normal returns. In this example exactly one of the conditions NAA or SAA is realized. Under an additional assumption we are able to express these conditions in terms of convergence of some series, determined by the parameters of the model (Theorem [\ref=theo:9]).

Let's briefly mention the mathematical tools used in the paper. The argumentation of Sect. [\ref=sec:2], where the key results are collected, is based only on elementary probabilistic inequalities. In the subsequent sections we utilize non-trivial but well-known results related to the theory of "small" markets. Some material from stochastic analysis is used in Sect. [\ref=sec:4] and  [\ref=sec:5].

Market models on finite probability spaces

Assume that for every n the set Ωn is finite, [formula] and there is an [formula]-adapted process [formula], [formula] of discounted stock prices, defined on the probability space [formula]. Denote by (x,y) the scalar product of vectors x and y in [formula]. Suppose that the set Xn of value processes consists of the elements Xn, admitting the representation

[formula]

where [formula] and the components of [formula]-predictable processes

[formula]

describe the number of stocks in investor's portfolio.

Let [formula] be the set of equivalent to [formula] probability measures, under which the process Sn is a martingale. Denote by [formula] the entropy of [formula] with respect to an (equivalent) measure [formula].

Let [formula]. Then for every n there exists a unique minimal reverse entropy martingale measure [formula]:

[formula]

and the following relations hold true

[formula]

Proof. Consider the optimization problems

[formula]

From Theorem 2.4 of [\cite=Sch04] we know that the problems ([\ref=3.1]) are solvable and their unique solutions V̂n∈Xn1, [formula] are related as follows [formula]. Moreover, the process V̂n = Vn is the numéraire portfolio and n minimizes the reverse relative entropy (see [\cite=Bec01] and Remark [\ref=rem:3]). Thus the proof is implied by conditions (d) of Theorems [\ref=theo:1] and [\ref=theo:2].

Semimartingale market models

In this section we assume that the processes in Xn, Dn have cádlág trajectories [formula]-a.s. Evidently, these assumptions do not affect the argumentation of Sect. [\ref=sec:2].

Suppose there are d(n) stocks in n-th small market and their discounted prices are described by a vector semimartingale [formula], adapted to the filtration [formula], satisfying the usual conditions [\cite=JacShi03]. Furthermore, assume that any element Xn∈Xn is of the form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] is an Sn-integrable process (notation: γn∈L(Sn)) and

[formula]

is a vector stochastic integral [\cite=JacShi03]. The quantity γi,nt determines the number of units of i-th stock in investor's portfolio at time t.

Let [formula] (resp., [formula]) be the set of equivalent to [formula] probability measures, under which the process Sn is a σ-martingale (resp., local martingale). Assume that [formula]. Then there exists the numéraire portfolio Vn∈Xn1. In full generality this assertion follows from the results of [\cite=ChrLar07] (see also [\cite=Bec01], [\cite=Kar06]). Thus the conclusions of Sect. [\ref=sec:2] are valid for the sequence (Xn) of semimartingale market models.

Denote by [formula] the set of equivalent to [formula] probability measures [formula] such that all processes in Xn are [formula]-supermartingales and put [formula].

The statements of Theorem [\ref=theo:6] below were proved in [\cite=KabKra98] under the assumption [formula]. Previously, assertion (a) was proved in [\cite=KleSch96a], where the process Sn was assumed to be locally bounded. We give alternative proofs, based on Theorems [\ref=theo:1], [\ref=theo:2] and on the well-known non-trivial results, concerning the approximative properties of inclusions

[formula]

Note that the inclusion [formula] follows from the Ansel-Stricker theorem [\cite=AnsStr94] (Corollary 3.5): see [\cite=DelSch98] (Theorem 5.3).

Let [formula]. Then

NAA condition is satisfied iff there exists a sequence [formula] such that [formula];

SAA condition is satisfied iff [formula] for any sequence [formula].

If [formula] then in the above statements the set [formula] can be replaced by [formula].

Proof. Let Zn∈Dn. It follows from Theorem 4(b) of [\cite=Zit02] (and, in fact, from the results of [\cite=KraSch99], [\cite=BraSch99]) that there exist a sequence of non-negative FnT-measurable random variables gk,n  ≤  1 and a sequence [formula], k  ≥  1 such that

[formula]

To each probability measure [formula], absolutely continuous with respect to [formula], we assign its Radon-Nikodym derivative [formula]. Thus the set of all such measures is identified with the subset [formula] of non-negative [formula]-integrable random variables. It is proved in [\cite=DelSch98] (Proposition 4.7) that the set [formula] is dense in [formula] with respect to the norm topology of L1,n. Therefore, we may assume that [formula].

Put εn = 1 / n and choose M(n) > 0 so that

[formula]

By Egorov's theorem there is a set Bn∈FnT such that

[formula]

and gk,nZk,nT converges to ZnT uniformly on Bn as k  →    ∞  . Furthermore, choose k(n) large enough to ensure the inequality

[formula]

Then for any An∈FnT the following esimates hold true:

[formula]

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

where [formula].

It follows from inequality ([\ref=2.1]) that if the sequence [formula] is contiguous with respect to [formula] then it is contiguous with respect to some sequence [formula]. Likewise, if [formula] for any sequence [formula] then [formula] for any sequence Zn∈Dn. By conditions (e) of Theorems [\ref=theo:1] and [\ref=theo:2] this proves that NAA condition implies the existence of a sequence [formula] such that [formula], and SAA condition is satisfied if the relation [formula] holds true for any sequence [formula].

The converse statements also follow from conditions (e) of Theorems [\ref=theo:1], [\ref=theo:2] and the inclusion [formula].

Let's prove the last assertion of the theorem. If [formula] then [formula] is dense in [formula] with respect to the norm topology of L1,n. This result, as is mentioned in [\cite=Klo06], follows from Theorem 1.1 of the paper [\cite=KabStr01]. Thus in the above argumentation the set [formula] can be replaced by [formula].

The subsequent theorem shows, in particular, that NAA and SAA conditions can be checked by exploring the sequence of strategies that achieve the optimal expected logarithmic utility of the terminal wealth. Taking into account the results of [\cite=GolKal00], [\cite=GolKal03], this gives an opportunity to express criteria for NAA and SAA conditions in terms of the semimartingale characteristic sequences of the stock price processes Sn.

Suppose, [formula] and

[formula]

Then for every n there exists a unique log-optimal strategy V̂n, a unique minimal reverse entropy supermartingale density Ẑn (see Remark [\ref=rem:3]) and the following relations hold true:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. The statements, concerning the existence and uniqueness of the processes V̂n, Ẑn with the above properties, the existence of the numéraire portfolio Vn and the relations Vn  =  V̂n, 1 / Vn  =  Ẑn were proved in [\cite=Bec01] with the use of the results of [\cite=KraSch99]. It remains to apply conditions (b) of Theorems [\ref=theo:3] and [\ref=theo:4] and conditions (d) of Theorems [\ref=theo:1] and [\ref=theo:2].

Diffusion market models

In the framework of the model considered in Sect. [\ref=sec:4], assume that for every n the stock prices are driven by m(n)-dimensional process [formula], t∈[0,T(n)], composed of independent standard Wiener processes Wi,n, defined on the filtered probability space [formula]. The stock prices Sn are subject to the system of stochastic differential equations

[formula]

where predictable stochastic processes μi,n, βi,n satisfy the conditions

[formula]

and Si0 > 0. We use the notation [formula] for the length of a vector x as well as for the absolute value of a scalar.

Assume also that d(n)  ≤  m(n) and the rank of the matrix σn with the rows (βi,n)di = 1 is equal to d(n) for all t,ω and n. Then the matrix σn(σn)T is invertible. Let the vector λn = (σn)T(σn(σn)T)- 1μn be such that

[formula]

It is customary to call λn a market price of risk process.

The following assertion is known: see e.g. Example 4.2 in [\cite=GolKal00] and Example 2.2.19 in [\cite=Chr05]. For convenience, we provide its direct proof.

Under the adopted assumptions there exists the numéraire portfolio

[formula]

Proof. We drop index n in the course of the proof. Represent Si as a sum of the process Ai of finite variation and the local martingale Mi:

[formula]

Since [formula] we conclude (see [\cite=JacShi03], Theorem 6.30) that the class L(S) consists of predictable processes γ, verifying the condition

[formula]

Condition ([\ref=4.1]) assures that the following local martingale (Girsanov exponential, represented by Dolean-Dade exponential) is well-defined:

[formula]

By virtue of the representation

[formula]

and the equality μi = (βi,λ), we deduce that the processes

[formula]

are local martingales. It follows (from [\cite=ChrLar07], Lemma 3.2) that the processes XZ, X∈X are local martingales as well. Hence, they are supermartingales and Z∈D.

Furthermore, let δ = (σσT)- 1μ and γi  =  δi / (ZSi). Then

[formula]

[formula]

and condition ([\ref=4.2]) is satisfied in view of ([\ref=4.1]). Thus, γ∈L(S).

Note that

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

and Z∈D admits the representation Z = 1 / V, [formula], which was to be proved.

Lemma [\ref=lem:2] shows that for the diffusion market model under consideration the results of Sect. [\ref=sec:2] are valid. The subsequent lemma allows us to give a characterization of NAA and SAA conditions in terms of the sequence (λn) (see Theorem [\ref=theo:8] below).

(a) The following equality holds:

[formula]

(b) [formula] for all M > 0 iff

[formula]

Proof. A simple calculation yields:

[formula]

[formula]

As long as [formula] for any non-negative local martingale Yn, by the estimate ([\ref=1.4]) we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

Taking the upper limit as n  →    ∞  , and then the limits as M  →    ∞  , N  →    ∞  , we get equality ([\ref=4.3]). Furthermore, let [formula] for all M > 0. Then inequality ([\ref=4.4]) implies that

[formula]

In the case of [formula] for all M > 0, by inequality ([\ref=4.5]) we have

[formula]

Taking the limits in ([\ref=4.6]), ([\ref=4.7]) as M  →    ∞  , we get the assertion (b).

The following relations hold true:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof follows directly from Lemma [\ref=lem:3] and conditions (c) of Theorems [\ref=theo:1] and [\ref=theo:2].

Theorem [\ref=theo:8] implies Propositions 8 and 9 of the paper [\cite=KabKra98]. Note, that as compared to [\cite=KabKra98], we do not merely drop the condition [formula], but even do not assume the existence of equivalent local martingale measures in the "small" markets.

Discrete-time infinite horizon market model with one log-normal stock

Consider a sequence (ξk)∞k = 1 of independent standard normally distributed random variables ξk∈N(0,1), defined on the probability space [formula], F  =  σ(ξk, k  ≥  1). Assume that there is only one stock, whose price is determined by the recurrence relation

[formula]

Here [formula], σk > 0 are non-random sequences.

We put [formula], T(n) = n and introduce the sequence of small markets, defined on the probability spaces [formula], [formula] with associated sets Xn of value processes, containing the elements X of the form

[formula]

An element δk∈[0,1] of (Fn)-predictable process (δn) describes the fraction of wealth, invested in the stock at time k.

Let the elements of the sequence (δ*k)k  ≥  1 be the solutions of the following optimization problems:

[formula]

and let [formula]. Then the processes (Xk / Vk)0  ≤  k  ≤  n are supermartingales ([\cite=Bec01], Example 6). Thus all the results of Sect. [\ref=sec:2] are valid. At that, the measures [formula] coincide with the restrictions of [formula] to Fn, and Vn = (Vk)nk = 0.

As is shown in [\cite=Shi99], the condition [formula] is sufficient for the absence of asymptotic arbitrage. More complete picture is given in Lemma [\ref=lem:4] and Theorem [\ref=theo:9]. Instead of a direct analysis of the sequence (Vk), we exploit conditions (c) of Theorems [\ref=theo:3], [\ref=theo:4].

Put ε > 0 and

[formula]

[formula]

The following assertions hold:

if Σ∞(1) <   ∞   then NAA condition is satisfied;

if Σ2∞(ε) =   ∞   for some ε > 0 then SAA condition is satisfied;

if there exists an ε∈(0,1) such that

[formula]

and Σ1∞(ε) =   ∞   then SAA condition is satisfied.

Proof. (a). Let [formula], where

[formula]

The independence of ξk and Fk - 1 and the equality [formula] imply

[formula]

Thus, (Zk)nk = 1 is an equivalent supermartingale density for Xn:

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=theo:3] we see that NAA condition is a consequence of the equality

[formula]

We have,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

and [formula] under condition (a). Conversely, [formula], α∈(0,1) by Jensen's inequality.

(b). Put [formula] and α∈(0,ε). Then

[formula]

and the correspondent value process X satisfies the inequality

[formula]

By condition (b) we have [formula] and by Theorem [\ref=theo:4] there exists a strong asymptotic arbitrage.

(c). Put [formula] To show the existence of a strong asymptotic arbitrage it is enough to prove that

[formula]

and apply Theorem [\ref=theo:4].

Since the series Σ1(ε) is divergent, the sequence (δk) contains infinitely many non-zero members. Without loss of generality, we assume that [formula] for all k and σk  →  0, k  →    ∞  .

By Taylor's formula we obtain the estimate

[formula]

Put [formula] Then

[formula]

Let us find an asymptotic form of the right-hand side of this inequality as k  →    ∞  . By formula (7.1.23) of [\cite=AbrSte72]:

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Moreover, νk  →  0 and

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

Furthermore, [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

and the condition Σ1∞(ε) =   ∞   implies ([\ref=5.2]).

The following assertions hold:

exactly one of the conditions NAA or SAA is satisfied and

[formula]

If condition ([\ref=5.1]) is satisfied for some ε∈(0,1) then

[formula]

Proof. The process (1 / Vn)n  ≥  1 converges a.s. since it is a positive supermartingale. Moreover, Vn is a product of independent positive random variables. From Kolmogorov's zero-one law it follows that the events {V∞  <    ∞  }, {V∞  =    ∞  } have probability 0 or 1.

Let [formula]. The sequence Vn converges to V∞  <    ∞   a.s. Hence, [formula] is tight:

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=theo:1] this implies the absence of asymptotic arbitrage.

If [formula] then

[formula]

and condition (c) of Theorem [\ref=theo:2] is satisfied. Hence, there exists a strong asymptotic arbitrage.

Assertion (b) follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:4] and the inequality Σn(ε)  ≥  Σn(1), ε∈(0,1).
