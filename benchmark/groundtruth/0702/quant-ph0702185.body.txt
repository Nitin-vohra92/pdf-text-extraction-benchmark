Violation of Energy Conservation in Boson and Fermion Fieldson Subwavelength Nano-Scale

The energy conservation law, which is one of the most important laws in physics, states that energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The energy conservation is a mathematical consequence of the shift symmetry of time. More abstractly, energy is a generator of a continuous time-shift symmetry of the physical system under study. When a physical system has a time-shift symmetry, Noether's theorem [\cite=Noeth] implies the existence of a conserved current. The thing that "flows" in the current is the energy, the energy is the generator of the symmetry group [\cite=Noeth] [\cite=Bye].

The energy conservation affects all systems without exceptions, for an example, classical [\cite=Nott] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] and quantum [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Scul] fields. Recently, we have shown that the cross-correlation energy associated with classical interference violates the energy conservation in an ensemble of EM modes having different phases [\cite=Kukh]. The ensemble does not obey the shift symmetry of time (the energy nonconservation does not contradict the energy conservation law) when the time shifts are different for each of the modes. The energy nonconservation should not be confused with the uncertainty principle. In quantum mechanics, lack of commutation of the time derivative operator with the time operator itself mathematically results in an uncertainty principle for time and energy: the longer the period of time, the more precisely energy can be defined. Although, quantum theory in general, and the uncertainty principle specifically, do not violate energy conservation, we have shown that the quantum interference could create or destroy energy for infinite time. In the present paper, the Hamiltonians describing the energy nonconservation in boson and fermion multimode fields under quantum interference are derived. We show that violation of the energy conservation is accompanied by the nonconservation of momentum, number of particles and field charge. The phenomena could be observed in Young's two-source subwavelength setup.

With the objective of deriving the Hamiltonians that describe the energy nonconservation in boson and fermion fields under quantum interference, let us begin with the canonical quantization of a Boson scalar field (spin s = 0) described by the Lagrangian density L = (∂μψ*)(∂μψ) - m2ψ*ψ . The dynamics of the field is determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion. Due to the space-time shift symmetry, the fields ψ and ψ* obey the conservation laws for the energy and momentum [\cite=Noeth] [\cite=Bye] [\cite=Nott] [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Scul]. The Lagrangian density is invariant under U(1) local gauge transformation (ψ  →  ψ' = eiφψ) given rise to the conserved current. The continuity equation for the 4-vector of the current density jμ  =  m(ψ*(∂μψ) - (∂μψ*)ψ) yields the conservation of the field charge [formula]. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by

[formula]

The secondary quantization of the field is performed by replacing the fields ψ and ψ* by the respective multimode field operators ψ̂ and [formula], where

[formula]

[formula]

and [formula]. Here, [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula] are respectively creation and destruction operators for boson particles and antiparticles inside a volume V = 1. The operators satisfy the canonical Bose commutation relations. Equation (1) yields the conventional Hamiltonian:

[formula]

Here, [formula] and [formula] are the number operators for particles and antiparticles, respectively.

We now consider a multimode field [formula], namely a superposition of N phase-coherent modes with different phases [formula]. The field does not obey the above-mentioned symmetries (conservation laws) [\cite=Noeth] [\cite=Bye] [\cite=Nott] [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Scul] if the shifts are different for each of the modes. The secondary quantization is performed by replacing the fields ψ and ψ* in (1) by the operators

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus the Hamiltonian (1) for the multimode field, an ensemble of noninteracting particles and antiparticles, has the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The procedure of secondary quantization for momentum P, number of particles N and field charge Q is similar. The first term in Eq. 7 corresponds to the conventional Hamiltonian (4) of a Boson scalar field [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Scul]. The second term, which is neglected in the field theory [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Scul], does associate with the quantum interference and the positive or negative cross-correlation energy. The interference phenomenon and phase correlation between the undistinguishable particles of different modes ([formula]) are taken into account by using the nonconventional (Bose-type) commutation relations

[formula]

= 1; the other operator pairs commute. One can use also the equivalent commutation relations:

[formula]

=   =    -  e -  iφm  +  iφn and [formula], the fluctuation of boson energy about its zero ensemble average for a vacuum state is zero, 〈E〉 = 0.

So far we have considered the Hamiltonian that takes into account the quantum interference in a field of scalar (s = 0) Boson particles. The quantization of a field of Boson particles having the spin s  >  0 is similar to the above-considered case of scalar particles. As an example, we derive the Hamiltonian of a Boson vector (spin s = 1) field of noninteracting particles that corresponds to an EM field. An EM field is described by the Lagrangian density L = ( - 1 / 4)ψμνψμν, where the 4-tensor ψμν is the field tensor Fμν; the 4-vector ψμ is the 4-potential Aμ [\cite=Nott] [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Scul]. The operators of the field have the form:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where uα * μ is the unit 4-vector of polarization; the index α corresponds to the two independent polarizations. Owing to the identity of the photons and anti-photons, [formula] and [formula]. The secondary quantization of the multimode field, an ensemble of N phase-coherent modes with different phases [formula], yields the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

We assume the commutation relation = 1; the other operator pairs commute.

The quantization of a multimode field of Fermion particles is similar to the above-considered Bose particles. As an example, consider a spinor (s = 1/2) field described by the Dirac Lagrangian density L = iγμ∂μψ - mψ. It is not necessary to repeat all the quantization procedures. The secondary quantization is performed by replacing the fields ψ and [formula] in the free Dirac field [\cite=Mont] [\cite=Land] [\cite=Jack] [\cite=Bere] [\cite=Itz] [\cite=Ryde] [\cite=Grei] [\cite=Wein] [\cite=Pes] by the operators:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the summation is performed over all values [formula] and σ  =    ±  1 / 2. The secondary quantization of the multimode field, an ensemble of N phase-coherent modes having different phases [formula], yields the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

The interference phenomenon and phase correlation between the undistinguishable fermions of different modes ([formula]) are taken into account by using the nonconventional (Fermi-type) anticommutation rules [formula] = [formula] = 1; the other operator pairs are anticommutative. In the case of [formula] = [formula] and [formula], the fluctuation of fermion energy about its zero ensemble average for a vacuum state is zero.

The cross-correlation integrals (9), (14) and (19) could be interpreted as exchange ones. The integrals describe the quantum exchange interference associated with the indistinguishability of identical particles. The quantum exchange of particles is somewhat similar to the exchange of virtual particles for a short time (Δt  ≤  1 / Δε) in perturbation theory. The cross-correlation integrals have nonzero values if [formula] or V =  ΔxΔyΔz  ≤  1  /  (kn - km)x(kn - km)y(kn - km)z. In agreement with principle of the indistinguishability of individual bosons, the commutation relations introduced above have the canonical form if [formula]. In the case of fermions, one should take into account the Pauli exclusion principle.

It is worth to note that all properties of an ensemble of bosons described by the first term in (7) are undistinguishable from the conventional Hamiltonian (4). The first term [formula]is responsible for the quantum interference of the modes with themselves. The term does not take into account the interference between the different modes. The quantum state φ∈ is a pure state because it is separable, [formula]. The energy [formula], momentum [formula], a total number [formula] of bosons, and field charge [formula] are conserved under interfering ("mixing") the quantum states [formula].

The behavior of the field described by the full Hamiltonian (7) is different from the usual Hamiltonian (4). The field quantum state φ is an entangled state because [formula]. The Hamiltonian (7) takes into account the phase correlation between the modes under the intermode interference. The positive or negative cross-correlation energy associated with the second term in (7) violates energy conservation in the field. Indeed, the energy can be created or destroyed in an ensemble of coherent modes by changing (shifting) the phases [formula] if the shifts are different for each of the modes. The phase modification under the free-space propagation or reflection of the mode does not require additional energy. The interference of modes completely destroys the energy if the modes interfere destructively in all points of a physical system. The interference creates energy if the modes interfere only constructively. For instance, in the case of [formula] (the commutation relations have the canonical form), the total energy depends on the values φn and φm: [formula] (see, (5-9)). The total number of particles and antiparticles can vary from zero to [formula]. In the case of φn  -  φm  =  π for the mode pairs, the interference completely destroys the energy (〈E〉=0), momentum (〈P〉=0), charge (〈Q〉 = 0) and the probability to find bosons ([formula]); here, we have discarded irrelevant constants associated with the vacuum field. The field has zero energy in both the vacuum and non-vacuum states under the commutation relations [formula] = [formula] = -  e -  iφm  +  iφn. The interference creates the maximum of the energy ([formula])), momentum ([formula])), a number of particles ([formula])) and charge ([formula])) if φn  -  φm = 0. In the case of the phase-noncorrelated modes, the energy [formula], momentum [formula], a number of bosons [formula], and field charge [formula] are conserved under the interference (see, (4-9)). If the phase-coherent modes have a spatial dependence appropriate for a cavity resonator, the model predicts the same result; the resonator modes are orthogonal to each other.

The nonconservation of energy, momentum, number of particles and field charge in the multimode boson field could be observed in Young's double-slit subwavelength setup. Let us consider the two-mode field; each of the phase-coherent modes contains one boson. The field describes a bi-boson (two entangled bosons). In conventional Young's setup, the two plane waves (modes) generated by the pinholes separated by the distance Λ >  > λ have different wave vectors, [formula] [\cite=Kukh]. The cross-correlation integrals (9) vanish if [formula]. Correspondingly, the energy [formula], momentum [formula], a total number [formula] of bosons, and field charge [formula] are conserved; here [formula]. In the case of Young's subwavelength (Λ <  < λ, [formula] = [formula]) system, the interference completely destroys the energy (〈E〉=0), momentum (〈P〉=0), charge (〈Q〉 = 0) and the probability to find bosons ([formula]) if φ1  -  φ2  =  π. If φ1  -  φ2 = 0, the interference creates the maximum of the energy ([formula])), momentum ([formula])), charge ([formula])) and a number of particles ([formula])); here [formula]. The result is different from the generally accepted opinion that the energy of two bosons, for instance photons, is always constant. According to our model, the energy of two noncorrelated bosons only is preserved, [formula]. This is in agreement with the fact that the frequency (energy) of a biphoton depends on the experimental configuration (the values of [formula] and φn) of the biphoton generation [\cite=Sou]. The interference of a single boson with itself does not create or destroy energy. In such a case, one of the modes characterized by [formula] or [formula] does not contain the boson. Notice that the phase conditions required for the creation or destruction of photon energy in Young's two-source experiment [\cite=Scul] [\cite=Baha] can be easily realized experimentally by using two subwavelength fibres with different refraction indexes. The energy nonconservation in a multimode photon field is relevant also to a Dicke quantum model [\cite=Dick] of superradiance emission of a subwavelength ensemble of atoms. In the model, the wave vectors of the light waves produced by the atoms in the far-field zone are practically the same, [formula]. In addition to the superradiance, our model predicts the total destruction of energy in the Dicke ensemble of atoms at the condition φn  -  φm  =  π for the atom (photon) pairs. Finally, our model shows that a quantum entangled state of photons is preserved on passage through a subwavelength aperture array; the values [formula] and φk do not change (see, (12-14)). The propagation of an entangled state through a lens, however, destroys the entanglement by the well-known modification of the wave vectors [formula] and phases [formula]. Such a behavior is in agreement with the experiment [\cite=Alte].

It should be stressed that our results do not contradict the conservation laws attributed to the space-time shift symmetry and the U(1) local gauge symmetry. The superposition of phase-coherent modes [formula] with different phases [formula] and the respective field operators do not obey the symmetries (conservation laws) if the shifts are different for each of the modes. The quantum state of the field is an entangled state. The interference phenomenon and phase correlation between the undistinguishable particles of different modes ([formula]) were taken into account by using the nonconventional commutation relations

[formula]

= 1. In the case [formula], the commutation relations have the canonical form. It worth noting that

[formula]

≈  0 for very large values of [formula] and [formula]. In this case, the quantum energy calculated by (7) is the same as the "classical" value (1) according to the correspondence principle, which states that the quantum and "classical" treatments must agree for a very large number of particles. We have presented formulas for the coherent modes. One can easily rewrite Eqs. (1-19) for the incoherent or partially coherent modes. The positive or negative cross-correlation energy and the corresponding positive or negative [\cite=Feyn] probability can be easily demonstrated for the boson and fermion fields described by the Hamiltonians (12) and (17). Notice that the energy, momentum, number of particles and electrical charge do not conserve in the fermion multimode field under the interference. In the case of electrons, the phase conditions required for the creation or destruction of energy in Young's two-source experiment can be easily realized by placing a solenoid between the slits like that in the Bohm-Aharonov setup [\cite=Aha].
