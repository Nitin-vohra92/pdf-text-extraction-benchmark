Recently, the study on QCD phase structure is extended to finite isospin density. The physical motivation to study QCD at finite isospin density and the corresponding pion superfluidity is related to the investigation of compact stars, isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies. While there is not yet precise lattice result at finite baryon density, it is in principle no problem to do lattice simulation at finite isospin density[\cite=son]. It is found that[\cite=kogut1] the phase transition from normal phase to pion superfluidity happens at a critical isospin chemical potential which is exactly the pion mass in the vacuum, μcI  =  mπ. The QCD phase structure at finite isospin density is also investigated in many low energy effective models, such as chiral perturbation theory[\cite=son] [\cite=kogut2] [\cite=split] [\cite=loewe] [\cite=michae], Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model[\cite=toub] [\cite=bard1] [\cite=frank] [\cite=he], random matrix method[\cite=klein], ladder QCD[\cite=bard2], and strong coupling lattice QCD[\cite=nishi].

There are two kinds of isospin symmetry breaking. At low isospin chemical potential, μI  <  μcI, the isospin symmetry is explicitly broken. In this phase, while σ and π mesons are still the eigen collective modes of the Hamiltonian of the system, the π meson splits into three channels with linear μI dependence for π+ and π- masses[\cite=he], Mπ+ = mπ  -  μI and Mπ- = mπ  +  μI. At high isospin chemical potential, μI  >  μcI, the isospin symmetry is spontaneously broken with nonzero pion condensate. In this phase, σ and π are no longer the eigen collective modes of the system, and the new eigen modes are the linear combination of them. In the pion superfluid, the simple linear dependence of the collective modes on the isospin chemical potential disappears, and masses of the new eigen modes are determined by the complicated pole equations[\cite=he].

Like the three π mesons which form an isospin triplet, proton and neutron are different isospin states of nucleon. Similar to the linear μI dependence for charged pions, we guess that there may exist a simple μI dependence for proton and neutron masses in the phase with only explicit isospin symmetry breaking. In this paper, we calculate the nucleon mass splitting at finite isospin chemical potential in the NJL model. We first extend the nucleon structure[\cite=ishii] of a quark and a diquark in the model to dense medium, and then determine analytically the proton and neutron masses at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials.

We take the two flavor NJL model defined by the Lagrangian density

[formula]

where C = iγ2γ0 is the charge conjugation matrix, the superscript t denotes the transposition operator, m0 is the current quark mass, μ is the quark chemical potential matrix in flavor space [formula] with μB and μI being baryon chemical potential and isospin chemical potential, Gs and Gd are coupling constants in color singlet channel and anti-triplet channel, [formula] are Pauli matrices in flavor space, and εf and εc are totally antisymmetric tensors in flavor and color spaces.

Since we are interested in the nucleon mass splitting induced by explicit isospin symmetry breaking at μI  <  μcI, there are no pion superfluid and color superconductor, the only condensate is [formula] which is the order parameter of chiral phase transition.

In mean field approximation, the thermodynamics of the system can be evaluated as[\cite=he]

[formula]

in terms of the quasi-particle energies E±i = Ep  ±  μi with [formula], where m = m0 - 2Gsσ is the effective quark mass. From the thermodynamic stable condition of the system, the physical condensate is determined by the gap equation

[formula]

which gives the temperature and chemical potential dependence of the quark mass, m(T,μB,μI). At zero temperature, the quark mass keeps its vacuum value in the normal phase without pion superfluid and color superconductor[\cite=he], m(0,μB,μI) = m(0,0,0).

Since we still have color symmetry, the effective quark propagator S in mean field approximation is independent of color index and diagonal in flavor space,

[formula]

with the elements

[formula]

In the NJL model, the meson modes and diquark modes are regarded as quantum fluctuations above the mean field, they can be calculated in the frame of RPA[\cite=klevansky] [\cite=zhuang] [\cite=he]. When the mean field quark propagator is diagonal in flavor and color spaces, e.g. the case with only chiral condensate, the summation of bubbles in RPA selects its specific channel by choosing at each stage the same proper polarization function, the diquark propagator can be written as

[formula]

where Πd is the diquark polarization function constructed by two quarks[\cite=ishii],

[formula]

There are three kinds of diquarks [formula] and [formula] constructed by quarks with colors 2 and 3, 1 and 3, and 1 and 2, respectively. Since the quark propagator is color independent, they are degenerated. Taking the trace in flavor and color spaces and employing the relation

[formula]

the polarization function can be simplified as

[formula]

now the trace is taken only in Dirac space.

Taking the replacements p0  →  p0  -  μu for the first term in the square bracket and p0  →  p0  -  μd for the second term, the chemical potential dependence of Πd and Dd can be reflected in a shift of the diquark energy,

[formula]

It is easy to see that the diquark polarization and propagator are isospin chemical potential independent. This is easy to be understood. From the interaction in diquark channel in ([\ref=njl]), only the quarks with different flavor and color can construct a diquark, and a u quark and a d quark have opposite isospin chemical potential. We should emphasize two points for the relation ([\ref=pid]). First, ([\ref=pid]) is valid only in normal phase where the effective quark mass m is a constant. In the pion superfluid phase, m is a function of chemical potentials, m(μB,μI), and then the relation ([\ref=pid]) fails. Second, at finite temperature the Lorentz invariance is broken down, and the integration over quark energy p0 or diquark energy k0 is changed into a summation over the discrete Fermi or Bose frequencies. Therefore, the replacement used to get ([\ref=pid]) does not work at finite temperature.

Now we investigate nucleons in the NJL model. A nucleon constructed by three quarks can be described by the three-body Faddeev equation[\cite=ishii]. In the static approximation[\cite=buck], the Faddeev equation is reduced to an effective BS equation constructed by a quark and a diquark, the quark propagator between two quark-diquark bubbles becomes a constant - 1 / m, and then we can use RPA again to derive the nucleon propagator[\cite=mineo]

[formula]

where ΠN is the nucleon polarization function

[formula]

Since the diquark contains a u and a d quark, we take Si = Su for protons and Si = Sd for neutrons. Making a transformation for the diquark energy, k0  →  k0 - 2μB / 3, we have

[formula]

The chemical potential dependence of ΠN and DN is only reflected in the quark propagator.

From the definition of particle mass, nucleon mass MN corresponds to the pole of the nucleon propagator at zero momentum,

[formula]

In the vacuum it is reduced to

[formula]

for the vacuum mass mN. At this stage, we can determine the four parameters in the NJL model, the current quark mass m0, the momentum cutoff Λ and the two coupling constants. By fitting the pion mass mπ = 140 MeV, pion decay constant fπ = 93 MeV and the quark mass m = 400 MeV in the vacuum, we have m0 = 5 MeV, Λ = 593 MeV and Gs = 6.92 GeV- 2. The coupling constant Gd in the diquark channel is controlled by the nucleon mass in the vacuum. The ratio between the two couplings is Gd / Gs = 1.1, corresponding to mN = 940 MeV and diquark mass Md = 600 MeV which can de obtained from the pole of the diquark propagator ([\ref=diquark1]). Note that the value of the ratio is in between the estimated minimum and maximum values[\cite=zhuang].

From the comparison between the pole equations ([\ref=matter]) in matter and ([\ref=vacuum]) in vacuum, we obtain analytically the relation between the nucleon masses MN in matter and mN in vacuum,

[formula]

For a proton which is a u(ud) state and a neutron which is a d(ud) state, we have

[formula]

Just as we expected, the nucleon mass splits into two channels in matter at finite isospin chemical potentia μI  <  μcI, and the proton and neutron masses change linearly in μI. Again, we should note that these linear relations are true only at zero temperature and in normal phase with only chiral condensate.

In summary, we have investigated the nucleon mass splitting in the phase with explicit isospin symmetry breaking in the frame of two flavor NJL model at zero temperature. While proton and neutron are still degenerated at finite baryon chemical potential μB and the mass drops down linearly in μB, the introduction of isospin chemical potential μI leads to their mass splitting. The proton mass decreases and neutron mass increases linearly in μI. This remarkable mass splitting may significantly change the properties, such as the threshold values, of those dynamic processes including protons and neutrons in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter.

At finite temperature, the pole equation for proton and neutron masses is still valid but it needs numerical calculations to obtain their temperature dependence. When we go into the pion superfluid region with finite pion condensate, the nucleon mass splitting is still true, but the linear relation fails, because the quark propagator is off-diagonal in flavor space and the diquark propagator and in turn the nucleon propagator become much more complicated.
