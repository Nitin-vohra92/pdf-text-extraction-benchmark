Embeddings into Free Heyting Algebras and Translations into Intuitionistic Propositional Logic

Introduction

Intuitionistic logic has been explored for many years as a language for computer science, with a guiding principle being the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation, under which intuitionistic proofs of implication are functions and existence proofs require witnesses. Higher-order intuitionistic systems which can express a great deal of mathematics, such as Girard's System F and Martin-Löf's type theory (good references are [\cite=girardpat] and [\cite=beeson]), have been developed and implemented by prominent computer scientists such as Constable, Huet and Coquand (see [\cite=nuprl] and [\cite=coq]). With all this development and with the existence of well-established topological, Kripke, and categorical semantics for intuitionistic systems, it may come as a surprise that many fundamental structural properties of intuitionistic propositional calculus have not been developed. By way of contrast, corresponding issues for classical logics have been settled for at least 75 years.

Heyting algebras are an equationally defined class of algebras with operations [formula], [formula], and →   and constants [formula] and [formula] (representing "or," "and," "implies," "false," and "true" respectively) that stand in the same relation to intuitionistic propositional logic that Boolean algebras do to classical propositional logic. What follows is a very brief introduction to free Heyting algebras and a summary of the results that will be presented in this paper.

For each [formula], let [formula] and let Fn be the set of propositional sentences in variables Vn. Let ≃ni and ≃nc be the intuitionistic and classical logical equivalence relations respectively.

The classical Lindenbaum algebra Bn is then defined as Fn  /  ≃nc and the intuitionistic Lindenbaum algebra Hn is defined as Fn  /  ≃ni. The operations [formula] and [formula] and the constants [formula] and [formula] are naturally defined on Bn and the operations [formula], [formula], and →   and the constants [formula] and [formula] are naturally defined on Hn. Bn is then isomorphic to the free Boolean algebra on n generators and Hn is the free Heyting algebra on n generators. As usual, the order ≤   may be defined from [formula] (or from [formula]). Like all Heyting algebras, each Hn is also a distributive lattice.

The analogous statements are true for [formula], Fω, Bω, and Hω.

The structure of each Bn and of Bω is well understood. However, among the free Heyting algebras, only H1 is completely understood. It is known from [\cite=nishimura] that if we let [formula], ψ1  =  x1, φi + 1  =  φi  →  ψi, and [formula], then each propositional formula in the single variable x1 is intuitionistically equivalent to exactly one formula in [formula]. Further, we can easily write down conditions characterizing the order on those formulas, so that the structure of H1 is completely characterized.

Although the structure of Hn for n  ≥  2 and of Hω is not fully understood, there are a number of facts known. Although not a complete list, the reader is referred to [\cite=bellissima], [\cite=ghilardi], [\cite=butz], and [\cite=darniere]. A very useful construction is contained in [\cite=bellissima] which will we avail ourselves of in this paper and which is described in Section [\ref=notation] below.

The results of this paper are as follows: There is a lattice-embedding from Hω into H2. This obviously implies that there is a lattice-embedding from Hm into Hn for any m  ≥  1, n  ≥  2, but in these cases, more is true: For any n  ≥  2 and m  ≥  1, there is a φ and a ψ∈Hn such that : = {ρ∈Hn|φ  ≤  ρ  ≤  ψ} and Hm are isomorphic as lattices. In addition, the isomorphism from

Notation, Terminology, and Bellissima's Construction

As above, let [formula].

We will use Bellissima's construction ([\cite=bellissima]) of, for each n, a Kripke model Kn over Vn satisfying Propositions [\ref=exact] and [\ref=phidef] below. The construction and relevant facts about it will be stated here.

Given a Kripke model K over Vn, let [formula] be the set of nodes of K and let [formula] be the (non-strict) partial order on [formula] given by K. If no confusion will result, we may use K in place of [formula]. Given α∈K, let [formula].

We will define a Kripke model Kn in stages, so that [formula] where the Kin are defined as follows:

[formula] and [formula]. For clarity, when we want to emphasize that we are thinking of U  ⊆  Vn as a node, we may write [formula] or [formula]. If we want to also note that it is in K0n, we may write [formula] or [formula]. For U  ⊆  Vn, we let [formula].

Given [formula], let Ti + 1 be the set of subsets T of [formula] such that [formula] and such that the elements of T are pairwise incomparable with respect to [formula]. Then we define [formula] to be

[formula]

For clarity, when we want to emphasize that we are thinking of 〈T,U〉 as a node, we may write [formula] or [formula]. If we want to also note that it is in Ki + 1n, we may write [formula] or [formula].

We declare that w(〈T,U〉)  =  U and we let [formula] be the reflexive transitive closure of [formula].

Let k(φ) denote the set of nodes in Kn which force φ, for φ a propositional formula in n variables.

For φ and ψ propositional formulas in [formula], [formula] iff k(φ)  ⊆  k(ψ).

For each node α∈Kn, there is a φα such that k(φα)  =  {β∈Kn|β  ≥  α} and there is a φ'α such that [formula].

We now fix some terminology.

If α  <  β are nodes in some Kripke model, then β is called a successor of α and α a predecessor of β. If there is no γ with α  <  γ  <  β, then β is called an immediate successor of α. The assertions "α is above β" and "β is below α" both mean α  ≥  β.

For any node α in any Kripke model, s(α) is the set of α's immediate successors.

If α∈Kn, then φα and φ'α are as in Proposition [\ref=phidef].

For each m, [formula]. This may also be called [formula] if n is clear from context and may be denoted in English as "level m."

If α∈Kn, then [formula] is the unique i such that [formula]. Note that if α  ≤  β, [formula].

If T is a set of nodes in Kn, let [formula]. Thus, for example, for any T with |T|  ≥  2, [formula]. The following facts will be used below and follow without much difficulty directly from the construction.

For n  ≥  2 and m  ≥  0, [formula]. In particular, there are arbitrarily large levels of Kn.

The following fact is a more general version of the preceding fact.

Let S  ⊆  Kn, |S|  ≥  3 and let each element of S be at the same level. Let S' be the downward closure of S. Then [formula] for any m greater than or equal to the common level of the elements of S .

A Lattice Embedding from Hm to Hn for m  ≥  1, n  ≥  2

Let n  ≥  2, m  ≥  1. Then there are φ, ψ∈Hn such that Hm is isomorphic to

[formula]

to Hm can be extended to a surjective lattice-homomorphism from Hn to Hm.

The main work is contained in the following proposition.

Let m  ≥  2 and n be such that there is a level [formula] of Kn and a set [formula] such that |A|  =  m and each α∈A has some immediate successor not above any other α'∈A. Then there is a φ, ψ∈Hn such that Hm is lattice-isomorphic to

[formula]

to Hm can be extended to a surjective lattice-homomorphism from Hn to Hm.

Fix A and i from the hypothesis.

Let [formula]. Let φ be

[formula]

For each A'  ⊆  A, let γA' be the node [formula] where [formula]. This is valid as the elements of r(T) are pairwise incomparable and |r(T)|  ≥  2 since m  ≥  2.

Note that γA' is at level i + 1 if A' is nonempty and at level i if A' is empty. Since each αi has a successor not above any other αj, if A'  ≠  A'', γA'  ≠  γA''.

Let [formula] and let ψ be [formula] where ψ0 is

[formula]

and ψ1 is

[formula]

Define a function g with domain Km as follows:

1. [formula] where A'  =  {αk|xk∈Vm  -  U}.

2. [formula], where [formula].

We will show that the range of g is contained in Kn. By induction, what we must show is that [formula] is in Kn, which will hold as long as |r(T')|  ≥  2.

The function g is into Kn and preserves order and nonorder. For all β∈Km and xk∈Vm, [formula] iff [formula].

We will prove by induction on i that g restricted to Kim satisfies the conditions in the statement of the lemma.

For i  =  0, observe that [formula] is pairwise incomparable and that if U  ≠  U', [formula] as they have different immediate successors. It is also the case that for all [formula] and xk∈Vm, [formula] iff xk∈U iff [formula], where A'  =  {αk|xk∈Vm  -  U}.

Finally, since each γA' is in Kn, the range of g restricted to K0m is contained in Kn.

Now suppose g restricted to Kim satisfies the hypotheses in the statement of the lemma.

We first show that the range of g restricted to Ki + 1m is contained in Kn. Let [formula]. If |T|  ≥  2, then |r(T)|  ≥  2 and we are done. If |T|  =  {β}, then [formula] and T' must contain both g(β) and αk, where xk∈w(β)  -  U. Since [formula], [formula]. Since it is fairly easy to see that each αk is not less than any element of the range of g, we must have |r(T')|  ≥  2.

It is immediate then that g restricted to Ki + 1m is preserves order and the immediate successor relation. Each element of [formula] is of the form [formula]. Observe that if U  ≠  U' and 〈T,U〉,〈T,U'〉∈Km, then [formula] as they have different immediate successors. Similarly, if r(T)  ≠  r(T') then [formula] as they have different immediate successors. We can now conclude that g preserves nonorder by using the inductive hypothesis and the fact that g preserves the immediate successor relation.

The sets [formula] and k(φ) are disjoint and [formula].

It is immediate that [formula] and k(φ) are disjoint.

We will first show that [formula]. It is clear that k(φ)  ⊆  k(ψ). Since every node in [formula] is at level ≥  i + 1, every node in [formula] forces ψ1. Since ψ0 is doubly negated and every successor of a node in [formula] is in [formula] or k(φ), by induction every element of [formula] forces ψ0 and [formula].

We will now show that [formula]. By construction, [formula] and [formula]. We will show that [formula] for all j  ≥  i  +  1 by induction on j. We just observed that this holds for j  =  i + 1.

Suppose it holds for j. A node of [formula] must be of the form [formula] for [formula]. Since T must contain an element of [formula] and every such node is below every element of [formula], T must be a subset of [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is [formula]

It follows from Lemmas [\ref=injection] and [\ref=disjoint] that g is an order-isomorphism from Km to k(φ)  -  k(ψ).

Define f:Fm  →  Fn by:

1. [formula]

2. [formula]

3. [formula].

4. [formula].

5. [formula].

For any ρ∈Fm, [formula]. If δ  =  g(γ) then [formula] iff [formula].

The proof that [formula] is an easy proof by induction on ρ.

We now prove the second part of the lemma by induction on ρ.

For [formula], the result is immediate. The observation that [formula] iff [formula] furnishes the case where ρ is xi. The inductive steps follow from the existence of the order-isomorphism g from Km to k(ψ)  -  k(φ) and the fact that [formula] for all ρ.

Note that it follows from Lemma [\ref=fembedding] that f is injective and hence an embedding.

We now define a function from Fn to Fm that is an inverse to f when restricted to

[formula]

A Lattice-Embedding from Hω to Hn for n  ≥  2

There is a lattice-embedding from Hω into H2

Pick α1,α2,α3,α4,α5∈K2, all at the same level, say i. This may be done by Fact [\ref=biglevel]. Let [formula]. Let φ be

[formula]

Let [formula]. Let ψ be

[formula]

Define a sequence {βji|i∈ω,j∈{1,2,3,4}} as follows: let βj0  =  αj. For i  ≥  0, let {βji + 1|j  =  1,2,3,4} be a collection of four distinct nodes of the same level, with [formula] and such that they all force [formula]. For example, we may take [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula].

As in [\cite=bellissima] (where a very similar construction is done), the nodes of {β1i|i∈ω} are pairwise incomparable, and they all force φ.

Define a Kripke model K over the language Vω  =  {xi|i∈ω} as follows: The set of nodes of K is the set k(ψ)  -  k(φ) and a node α forces xi iff [formula].

For all φ∈Fω, let [formula].

For all φ,ψ∈Fω, k(φ)  ⊆  k(ψ) iff [formula].

Since K is a Kripke model, if [formula], k(φ)  ⊆  k(ψ).

Suppose [formula]. Then there is a rooted finite Kripke model K' over Vω such that [formula] and [formula]. Since variables not occurring in φ or ψ are irrelevant, we may assume that each node of K' forces cofinitely many propositional variables.

Define a map a:K'  →  K inductively on K' as follows: If γ∈K' is a node such that a(γ') has defined for all immediate successors of γ, then let a(γ) be a node whose set of successors in K2 is the upward-closure of the set [formula].

For each i, [formula] iff [formula]. Since a is also order-preserving and its range is upward-closed in K, we have that if γ is the root of K', [formula] and [formula].

Now, as before, define f:Fω  →  F2 by:

1. [formula]

2. [formula]

3. [formula].

4. [formula].

5. [formula].

By precisely the same argument as before, this is an embedding.

Note that, by [\cite=bellissima], in any interval ⊆  Hn, there are atomic elements. As there are no atomic elements in Hω, Hω cannot be embedded in Hn as an interval.

Impossibility of Lattice-Embedding Bω into Hω

Let Bω be the countable atomless Boolean algebra. We will think of it as the Lindenbaum algebra of classical propositional logic on countably infinitely many variables.

There is no lattice embedding from Bω into Hn for any n or into Hω.

By the previous theorem, it suffices to prove the proposition for H2. Suppose there is a lattice embedding of Bω into H2. Call it f.

Let [formula] have n subformulas. Consider the 2n formulas [formula], [formula]. Since f preserves [formula] and [formula] we must have that {k(f(φi))|1  ≤  i  ≤  2n} is a partition of [formula] and that [formula] is non-empty for each i.

Let α be a node in a Kripke model with exactly two immediate successors, α1 and α2. Let φ be a formula. Suppose that for each subformula φ' of φ, [formula] iff [formula] and that for all propositional variables v appearing in φ, if α1 and α2 force v, then [formula]. Then for each subformula φ' of φ, [formula] iff [formula]. In particular, [formula] iff [formula] iff [formula].

By induction on the structure of φ. The conclusion is immediate if φ is atomic, and the [formula] and [formula] cases are straightforward.

Suppose φ is φ1  →  φ2. By induction, we can conclude that [formula] iff [formula] if φ' is a subformula of φ1 or φ2. We just have to verify that [formula] iff [formula].

Suppose [formula]. Then, as α1  ≥  α, [formula].

Now suppose [formula]. Thus, there must be some α'  ≥  α such that [formula] and [formula]. If α'  =  α then we are done by induction. Otherwise, we must have α'  ≥  α1 or α'  ≥  α2, and thus [formula].

For each i, let [formula]. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be some i and j, i  ≠  j, such that [formula] iff [formula] for all subformulas φ' of [formula]. Let β be [formula]. We can easily verify that β∈K2. By the lemma, [formula]. Thus, β is in [formula] for some m. Without loss of generality, say m  ≠  i. Then [formula] and [formula] but [formula], a contradiction.

Order-Embeddings

Any countable partial ordering can be order-embedded into H2 (and, therefore, into Hn for any n  ≥  2).

We first make the following definition:

Let [formula] be a set of nodes of K2 all with the same level. Let [formula].

We define [formula] to be

[formula]

If [formula] then ψ(T) will denote [formula]. If some αi is at a different level than some αj, [formula] is not defined.

A formula of the form [formula] where m  ≥  3 will be called permissive. The set [formula] is called the set of generators of [formula] and [formula] is called the level of [formula].

Given any permissive formula ψ, there exist permissive formulas ψn for n∈{0,1} such that for each n∈{0,1}, k(ψn)  ⊆  k(ψ) and [formula] is finite.

Let i be greater than the level of ψ with [formula]. We can find i by Fact [\ref=bignotnot]. Let [formula], let ψ0  =  ψ(α1,α2,α3) and ψ1  =  ψ(β1,β2,β3).

We define ψσ, for σ∈{0,1}<  ω as follows: Let [formula]. Given φσ, define φσn for n∈{0,1} so that φσn is permissive, k(φσn)  ⊆  k(φσ), and [formula] is finite as in the above lemma.

Note that [formula] iff σ is an initial segment of σ' as a binary string. Note also that [formula] iff there is an i such that σ  =  σi.

A set S  ⊆  H2 such that each element of S is a disjunction of the form [formula] is called complete if it satisfies the following property: Let S1, S2 be such that [formula], [formula], S1 is upward closed, and S2 is downward closed. Then there is some σ(S1,S2) such that [formula], ψσ(S1,S2) implies every element of S1, and ψσ(S1,S2) implies no element of S2.

Note that the condition that

[formula]

means that no ψσ∈S can imply ψσ(S1,S2).

Note also that if σ1 is such that [formula], ψσ1 implies every element of S1, and ψσ1 implies no element of S2 then so does σ1σ2 for any σ2 (where the juxtaposition indicates concatenation). Without loss of generality, then, we may assume that each σ(S1,S2) has the same length.

The proposition will follow from the following lemma.

Suppose P is a finite partial order, S  ⊆  H2 is a complete set, and h is an isomorphism from P to (S,  ≤  ). For any partial order P' such that |P'|  =  |P|  +  1, there is a φ of the form [formula] such that [formula] is complete, [formula] via an isomorphism extending h.

If [formula], let φ be ψ0. This is complete as we may let [formula] and [formula].

Suppose [formula] where T1 is downward closed and T2 is upward closed, and we would like to find φ so that φ is above all the elements of T1, below all the elements of T2 and incomparable with the elements of T3.

Let S be the collection of all partitions (S1,S2) of S such that S1 is upward closed and S2 is downward closed.

Let φ be

[formula]

Clearly, φ is above every χ∈T1. We also have that φ is below every ρ∈T2, since every χ∈T1 must be below every ρ∈T2, and by definition every ψσ(S1,S2)0 with T2  ⊆  S1 is below every ρ∈T2.

φ is not above any element in [formula]: As noted above, [formula] implies σ  =  σi for some i. But the disjuncts of φ are either elements of T1 (which cannot be implied by elements of T2 or T3) or of the form ψσ where the length of σ is greater than the length of any σ' for ψσ' some disjunct of a formula in [formula].

φ is not below any element in [formula]: Let [formula]. Let S2  =  {μ'|μ'  ≤  μ} and S1  =  S - S2. Then ψσ'(S1,S2)0 is a disjunct of φ which does not imply μ.

To see that [formula] is complete: Let (S1,S2)∈S with φ∈S1. Since S1 is upward closed, we must have [formula]. Thus ψσ(S1  -  {φ},S2)0 is a disjunct of φ. We may therefore take σ(S1,S2) to be σ(S1  -  {φ},S2)0 concatenated with enough zeroes to make its length greater than [formula].

Let (S1,S2)∈S with φ∈S2. Thus T1  ⊆  S2. If there is any member of T2 in S2, then we may take σ(S1,S2) to be any sufficiently long extension of σ(S1,S2  -  {φ}), since ψσ(S1,S2  -  {φ}) cannot imply φ since φ implies each element of S2.

Thus we may assume that T2  ⊆  S1. Therefore, ψσ(S1,S2  -  {φ})0 is a disjunct of φ. By construction, there are no disjuncts of φ above it. We may take σ(S1,S2) to be any sufficiently long extension of σ(S1,S2  -  {φ})1.
