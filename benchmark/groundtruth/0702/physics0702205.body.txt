QED calculation of the 2p3 / 2 - 2p1 / 2 transition energy in five-electron ion of argon

In the recent paper [\cite=draganic:03], high precision measurements of the 2p3 / 2 - 2p1 / 2 transition energy in Ar XV, Ar XIV, Ar XI, and Ar X have been reported. The best results have been achieved for the five-electron ion of argon, where the experimental precision is 2700 times better than the theoretical one and 200 times better than that in the best of the previous measurements. This unprecedent precision provides a unique possibility to test various branches of the theory describing many-electron systems.

Since within the framework of the non-relativistic theory the 2p3 / 2 and 2p1 / 2 levels are degenerate, the transition energy is exclusively determined by the relativistic and quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. Hence, investigation of this transition allows us to test the many-electron QED effects as well as calculations of the relativistic electron-correlation effects up to an extremely high level of accuracy.

To date ab initio calculations of many-electron QED effects were considered for two- and three-electron ions [\cite=artemyev:05] [\cite=yerokhin:01:pra2p]. For systems with a larger number of electrons these effects were accounted for only within some one-electron or semi-empirical approximations [\cite=safronova:96] [\cite=draganic:03] [\cite=indelicato:05]. Although the agreement of the results of Refs. [\cite=draganic:03] [\cite=indelicato:05] with experiment is rather good, the precision of these calculations is much worse compared to the experimental one. The improvement of this precision is a challenging problem for the theory. The goal of the present letter is to improve the theoretical precision for the 2p3 / 2 - 2p1 / 2 transition energy in Ar13 +. To achieve this goal we perform rigorous QED calculations to first two orders of perturbation theory and extremely large-scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm (CI-DFS) calculations of the third- and higher-order contributions within the Breit approximation.

To formulate the QED perturbation theory we use the two-time Green function method [\cite=shabaev:02:rep]. Instead of usual Furry picture, where only the nucleus is considered as a source of the external field, we have used an extended version of the Furry picture. It implies incorporation of some screening potential, which partly accounts for the interelectronic interaction, into the zeroth-order Hamiltonian. The perturbation theory is formulated in powers of the difference between the full QED interaction Hamiltonian and the screening potential. This accelerates the convergence of the perturbative series. In addition, the usage of the screening potential allows us to avoid the degeneracy of the (1s)2(2s)22p3 / 2 and (1s)2(2p1 / 2)22p3 / 2 states that occurs if the pure Coulomb potential is employed as the zeroth-order approximation.

In the present letter we use four different types of the effective potential. The simplest choice is the core-Hartree (CH) potential. To obtain this potential we add the radial charge density distribution of the (four) core electrons
