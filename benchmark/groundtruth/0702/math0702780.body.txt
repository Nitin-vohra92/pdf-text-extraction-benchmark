Introduction

Let [formula] be the field of residue classes modulo a prime number p and let A be a non-empty subset of [formula] Consider the sum set

[formula]

and the product set

[formula]

Bourgain, Katz, Tao [\cite=BKT] and Bourgain, Glibichuk, Konyagin [\cite=BGK] have shown that if |A| < p1 - δ, where δ > 0, then one has the sum-product estimate

[formula]

for some ε  =  ε(δ) > 0. This result has found a number of spectacular applications in combinatorial problems and exponential sum estimates, see [\cite=B1]-[\cite=BKT].

Bound [\eqref=eqn:sumprodclass] does not yield an explicit relationship between ε and δ. Hart, Iosevich and Solymosi [\cite=HIS], by using Kloosterman sums, could obtain a concrete value of ε in certain ranges of |A|. More precisely, they proved that

[formula]

The aim of the present paper is to obtain an explicit sum-product estimate for any range of |A|.

Let |A| > 1. Then

[formula]

In particular, if 1 < |A| < p7 / 13( log p)- 4 / 13, then we have

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest] uses results and tools from arithmetical combinatorics. When |A| is larger than p5 / 9, combinatorial arguments and trigonometric sums can be used together to get a better estimate.

Let |A| > 1. Then

[formula]

In particular, if 1 < |A| < p2 / 3, then we have

[formula]

When p7 / 10( log p)- 1 / 3 < |A| < p, the inequality [\eqref=eqn:HIS] is preferable. We remark that [\eqref=eqn:HIS] can also be proved using the method described in the present paper.

In the corresponding problem for integers (i.e., if the field [formula] is replaced by the set of integers) the conjecture of Erdös and Szemerédi [\cite=ErSz] is that max {|A + A|,|AA|}  ≫  c(ε)|A|2 - ε for any ε > 0. At present the best known bound in the integer problem is max {|A + A|,|AA|}  ≫  |A|14 / 11( log |A|)- 3 / 11 due to Solymosi [\cite=Sol].

We do not know what the optimal lower bound for max {|A + A|,  |AA|} in terms of |A| and p should be. It is known that the analogy of the Erdös and Szemerédi conjecture in the form max {|A + A|,|AA|}  ≥  c(ε) min {|A|2 - ε,p1 - ε} for all subsets A of [formula] does not hold.

In what follows, all the sets under consideration are assumed to be non-empty. For a set [formula] and for an element [formula] we use the notation

[formula]

Lemmas

The following lemma follows from the work of Glibichuk and Konyagin [\cite=GK].

Let [formula] with 1 < |A1| < p1 / 2. Then there exist elements a1,a2,b1,b2∈A1 such that [formula] and

[formula]

When |A1| > p1 / 2, we will use the following statement (see [\cite=BGK] or [\cite=Glib]).

Let [formula] with |A1| > p1 / 2. Then there exist a1,a2,b1,b2∈A1 such that

[formula]

The following lemmas are due to Ruzsa (see [\cite=Nat], [\cite=R1], [\cite=R2], [\cite=TV]). They hold for subsets of any abelian group, but here we state them only for subsets of [formula] We will repeatedly use these lemmas to prove our result. Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaTr] is called Ruzsa's triangle inequality.

For any subsets X,Y,Z of [formula] we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be any subsets of [formula] with

[formula]

Then there is an X1  ⊂  X such that

[formula]

An important corollary of Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaPlun] is the inequality

[formula]

Below, when we refer to Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaPlun], we will always understand this inequality. The case k = 2 illustrates another version of Ruzsa's triangle inequality.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest]

We use an idea of the proof of Katz-Tao lemma presented in [\cite=TV]. That proof, as it was mentioned in [\cite=TV], used Bourgain's idea from [\cite=B2].

We may assume that |A|2  ≥  100|AA| and that [formula] Let J denote the number of solutions of the equation

[formula]

From the well-known relationship between the cardinality of a set and the number of solutions of the corresponding equation, we have that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

there exists a fixed element b = b0∈A such that

[formula]

For a given positive integer j  ≤   log |A| /  log 2 + 1, let Dj be the set of all a∈A for which

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

Let the quantity [formula] takes its biggest value (or one of its biggest values if there are several such ones) when j = j0. Denote

[formula]

Then, for any a∈A1, we have

[formula]

In particular, since N  ≤  |A| and |A1|  ≤  |A|, we get

[formula]

Now let a be an arbitrary element of A1. From Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaTr] and the inequality [\eqref=eqn:aAcapbAge] we have

[formula]

Furthermore, using Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaPlun] with

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Thus, the bound

[formula]

holds for any a∈A1 and for any choice of the sign "±  ".

There are two cases to consider.

Case 1: |A1| < p1 / 2.

First of all, in this case besides of [\eqref=eqn:boundA1], we also have

[formula]

Thus, together with [\eqref=eqn:boundA1], we have

[formula]

Since A1  ⊂  A, according to Lemma [\ref=lem:GKon] there exist a1,a2,b1,b2∈A1 such that [formula] and

[formula]

We apply Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaPlun] with k = 3 and

[formula]

Then we get

[formula]

Next, we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaPlun] with k = 4 and

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

Applying the inequality [\eqref=eqn:aA_pm_b0A] to the right hand side of [\eqref=eqn:2A-2A_to_b0A-aA] and incorporating the resulting estimate to [\eqref=eqn:3A-3A_to_2A-2A], we get

[formula]

Taking into account [\eqref=eqn:aAcapbAge] to substitute N|A1| and then [\eqref=eqn:Case1NA1] to substitute N, we conclude that

[formula]

This proves Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest] in Case 1.

Case 2:  |A1| > p1 / 2.

In this case, according to Lemma [\ref=lem:bigAgeneral], there exist elements a1,a2,b1,b2∈A1 such that

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:RuzsaPlun] with k = 4 and

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Taking into account the inequality [\eqref=eqn:aA_pm_b0A], we obtain that

[formula]

Using [\eqref=eqn:boundA1], we get

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest] is proved.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest1]

We remark that the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:bigAgeneral], as well as the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:GKon], uses the fact that for any sets [formula] there exists ξ∈G such that

[formula]

This estimate is nontrivial when |G| is larger than |X| and |Y|. In order to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest1] we would like to have a similar estimate which in certain cases would be nontrivial when the cardinality of G is smaller than those of X and Y. The following lemma provides with such an estimate.

Let [formula] Then there exists ξ∈G such that

[formula]

It is easy to see that the bounds [\eqref=eqn:aAcapbAge], [\eqref=eqn:boundA1], [\eqref=eqn:aA_pm_b0A] and Lemma [\ref=lem:XYG] imply Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest1]. Indeed, apply Lemma [\ref=lem:XYG] with

[formula]

Then for some a∈A1, in view of [\eqref=eqn:aA_pm_b0A], we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Recalling [\eqref=eqn:aAcapbAge], [\eqref=eqn:boundA1], we get that either

[formula]

or

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Thus, if we prove Lemma [\ref=lem:XYG], then we are done. To this end, let I denote the number of solutions of the equation

[formula]

We express I via trigonometric sums:

[formula]

Picking up the term corresponding to n = 0 and then extending the summation over g to the whole range 0  ≤  g  ≤  p - 1, we obtain

[formula]

Therefore, there exists a fixed element ξ∈G such that the number I0 of solutions of the equation

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

From the relationship between the cardinality of a set and the number of solutions of the corresponding equation, we derive that

[formula]

This proves Lemma [\ref=lem:XYG] and thus Theorem [\ref=thm:sumprodest1] is also proved.
