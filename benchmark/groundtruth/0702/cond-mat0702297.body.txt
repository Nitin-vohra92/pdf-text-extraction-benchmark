Nonintegrability and fluctuation by symmetry violation in perturbed harmonic oscillator systems

Introduction

We demonstrate the characterization of chaos by exploiting a correlation coefficient for a rate of elongations and contractions of consecutive phase-space point spacings. In the case of an integrable orbit on a Poincar[formula] section plane[\cite=rf:1] [\cite=rf:2], it is found that a degree of symmetry occurs between the elongation and contraction rates of the consecutive phase-space point spacings. When this symmetry occurs, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient becomes 1.0. On the other hand, the symmetry of the rates of elongation and contraction is violated when integration becomes impossible, and the absolute values of correlation coefficients are close to zero. This analysis provides us with a new method of considering how the nonintegrabilities depend on the degree of symmetry violation between the elongations and contractions of consecutive phase-space point spacings in perturbed harmonic oscillator systems. We compare the information obtained from the absolute value of the correlation coefficient with that obtained from the Lyapunov exponent[\cite=rf:1] [\cite=rf:2] and show the advantage of using the correlation coefficient. Moreover, we show that a fluctuation property derived from the consecutive phase-space point spacings follows the shape of a non-Gaussian distribution function as the degree of symmetry violation increases.

Consecutive phase-space point spacings

To begin with, let us define ln. The spacing of consecutive phase-space points on the Poincar[formula] section plane is defined as [formula]. Here, n enumerates a set of points on the Poincar[formula] section plane. The scaled spacings of ln is defined as [formula], where the bar denotes a "spacing average" over all spacings. The spacings were scaled to make n = 1.0. The following modified nondimensional [formula](3) Hamiltonian[\cite=rf:3] [\cite=rf:4] was adopted in analyzing Ln:

[formula]

where [formula], and V(1) and V(2) denote the strength of perturbation interaction in each degree of freedom. The system with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.1) consists of three single-particle levels with energies E(0), E(1), and E(2), where each level has N-fold degeneracy. All subsequent analysis assumes that V(1) = V(2) = V. In our numerical calculation, we used N = 30, and the single-particle energies were E(0) = 0, E(1) = 1, and E(2) = 2. The position at time t is written as q(1)n, and the position at time t + ε is written as q(1)n + 1, where ε represents the time step of our simulation.

The succession of mappings with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.1) is approximated as

[formula]

Hereafter the discussion focuses on q(1) and p(1), which are written as q and p for simplicity.

If the interaction V is sufficiently small, the Poincar[formula] section map turns out to be closed curves, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Many orbits form invariant curves in this map, like Fig.1(a), as guaranteed by the KAM theorem. [\cite=rf:1] [\cite=rf:2] In this weak-interaction case, the time dependence of Ln turns out to be periodic, as shown in Fig.2(a) and Fig.3(a). The alternating behavior of Ln for this case is shown in more detail in Fig.2(d). The value of Ln is distributed in the range 0.943 to 1.03, giving a distribution width of 0.087. As is clearly seen from Fig.3(a), the Fourier components[\cite=rf:5] expressing the mixing effects from other periodic orbits are small in the case of a small interaction V =  - 0.009. Comparing Fig.3(a) with Fig.3(b), one can see that the peak of the Fourier coefficients becomes continuous when the interaction strength increases from V =  - 0.009 to V =  - 0.045. As the interaction strength increases further, the chaotic region begins to spread out from the hyperbolic fixed points. This is shown in Fig.1(c). In this chaotic case, the value of Ln is distributed in a wider range from 0.0 to 2.0, giving a distribution width of 2.0, and the periodicity of Ln disappears, as shown in Fig.2(c) and Fig.3(c). A set of peaks extending from n = 0 to n = 5018 and beyond with no clear maxima in the Fourier coefficients of consecutive point spacings reflects the nonintegrability of the orbit.

Symmetry violation for consecutive phase-space point spacings and the relationship to chaos

We will now examine a quantitative estimate of chaos that uses the absolute value of the correlation coefficient for the rates of elongation and contraction of Ln. In the case where [formula], the rate of elongation is defined as [formula], and in the case where [formula], the rate of contraction is defined as [formula]. For example, the values [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] give rise to elongation rates R1 = 1.1, R2 = 1.2, and R3 = 1.3 and contraction rates r1 = 0.9, r2 = 0.8, and r3 = 0.7. The average rates of elongation and contraction for a number M of phase-space point spacings are given by

[formula]

One may introduce a correlation coefficient[\cite=rf:6] for Rm and rm that takes the form

[formula]

Now, let us begin our analysis by considering the regular-to-chaos transition visible in Figs.1(a)-(c) and Figs.2(a)-(c). Since the consecutive phase-space point spacings are periodic in the case of a weak interaction, the time dependences of Rm and rm are symmetric with respect to [formula], as shown in Fig.4(a). In this case, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is close to 1.0. In Fig.4, note that the time series of Rm and rm are independent of each other. As the interaction strength increases only slightly, the orbit appears as shown in Fig.1(b), and Rm and rm now behave as shown in Fig.4(b). This orbit is, however, not integrable and it can be seen that the symmetry between Rm and rm is approximately maintained as shown in Figs.4(b) and 4(d). When the interaction strength increases as shown in Fig.1(c), one may not expect symmetric behavior between Rm and rm, and this is demonstrated in Fig.4(c). In this case, as seen from Fig.5, the absolute values of the correlation coefficients are close to zero.

Features of the correlation coefficient analysis

In this section, the process is analyzed using the absolute value of the correlation coefficient and the Lyapunov exponent, for the case in which the periodic orbit transitions to the nonintegrable orbit.

In the case with weak interaction, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient quickly reaches 1.0 as shown in Fig.6(a). When the interaction strength increases, the absolute values of the correlation coefficients are close to 0.0, as shown in the plot for V =  - 0.110 in Fig.6(a).

When the orbit is completely integrable, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient has exactly 1.0 as an upper bound. On the other hand, if the orbit is nonintegrable, it has |CRmrm| = 0.0 as a lower bound. The Lyapunov exponent takes negative values when the system is integrable and positive values when the system is non-integrable. However, the upper and lower limits of the value of the Lyapunov exponent are not clear, as depicted in Fig. 6(b).

Asymmetric behavior in consecutive phase-space point spacings and nonintegrability in the Hénon-Heiles system

To date, the analysis of |CRmrm| has been performed using the specific SU(3) Hamiltonian with fixed energy E=40. To confirm the usefulness of our analysis using |CRmrm|, let us apply our method to the Hénon-Heiles system[\cite=rf:1] and also study what happens when the energy of the system is varied.

The Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

If the energy E is sufficiently small, the Poincar[formula] section map turns out to be integrable, as shown in Fig. 7(a). In this case, it is found that a degree of symmetry occurs between the Rm and rm as shown in Fig. 8(a). Since this symmetry occurs, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient becomes 0.5091691 shown in Fig. 9(a). In Fig.7(b), the successive intersections of the trajectory with the Poincar[formula] section plane lie on twenteen closed curves with ten hyperbolic fixed points located at the joins of adjacent closed curves. Nonintegrability appears in the Hénon-Heiles system as energy increases. An example of this at E = 0.1669 is shown in Fig. 7(c). From Figs. 8(c) and 9(a), it can be seen that the symmetry between Rm and rm is violated with the result that the absolute value of the correlation coefficient approaches zero.

Next, we describe an advantage that the correlation coefficient has when compared with the Lyapunov exponent. The unstable orbit of Fig. 7(b) is divided into two orbits, as depicted in Figs. 10(a)-(b). The absolute value of the correlation coefficient for the orbit in Fig. 7(b) is represented by the short dashed line corresponding to E = 0.11796899 in Fig. 9(a). The value of |CRmrm| markedly varies in the region around m  ≈  2450 as seen in Fig. 9(a). The corresponding values for the Lyapunov exponent are represented by the short dashed line in Fig. 9(b). As can be seen in those figures, there is a clear change in the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the sections corresponding to the orbit of Fig. 10(a) and the orbit of Fig. 10(b). The Lyapunov exponent calculation shows the value does not vary markedly with increasing time, as illustrated in Fig. 9(b). In this case, the differing orbits of the two time sections shown in Figs. 10(a)-(b) cannot be distinguished clearly. This suggest a possible advantage of the correlation coefficient over the Lyapunov exponent. The numerical results discussed here show that it is possible to use |CRmrm| to sensitively detect even slight changes of orbit, something that the Lyapunov exponent is unable to do.

Symmetry violation and probability density distributions

The main topic of this section is the determination of a relationship between a fluctuating property measuring symmetry violation and nonintegrability. To begin with, we define a new variable Om = Rm  ×  rm. When the perturbation interaction is sufficiently small, as in Fig. 4(a), this quantity is stationary with a value of Om  ≈  1.0 as shown in Fig. 11(a). This corresponds to the case where there is symmetry between Rm and rm and |CRmrm|  ≈  1.0. This suggests the following equation for the time evolution m when the system is completely integrable.

[formula]

In the case of Figs. 4(b)-(c), the balance between the elongation rate and contraction rate of the phase-space point spacings is broken, and this is confirmed in Figs. 11(b)-(c) as a fluctuation where [formula]. The statistical properties of this fluctuation are now discussed. To handle the logarithmic behavior between the elongation rate and contraction rates, and hence of Om, let us introduce the variable Qm, where

[formula]

For example, the values O1 = 2.0, O2 = 5.0, O3 = 10.0, O4 = 0.5, O5 = 0.2, and O6 = 0.1 correspond to Q1 = 1.0, Q2 = 4.0, Q3 = 9.0, Q4 =  - 1.0, Q5 =  - 4.0, and Q6 =  - 9.0. This variable behaves in a manner similar to Om for symmetry violations.

We now investigate the distribution of Qm with increasing nonintegrability. Figures. 12(a)-(c) show the probability density P(Qm) of finding for the components a value between Qm and Qm + dQm for each interaction value. The probability density of Qm behaves as a delta function when the system is integrable, as shown in Fig. 12(a). On the other hand, it becomes a non-Gaussian function as follows, such as that shown in Fig. 12(c) when the nonintegrability is intensified.

[formula]

Where the parameter α is fitted by the general least squares procedure[\cite=rf:6].

In the case of the Hénon-Heiles system at an energy of 0.1669, P(Qm) also shows a function in Eq. (6.3), as can be seen in Fig. 14(c). This corresponds to the fluctuation property Om in Fig. 13(c).

Note that the statistical property of Om changes from a delta function to a function in Eq. (6.3) with increasing perturbation strength. This highlights the importance of Om as a fluctuating measure of non-integrability in the perturbed harmonic oscillator systems.

Conclusions

We conclude that this analysis provides us with a new method of detecting nonintegrabilities based on the degree of symmetry violation between Rm and rm. It was demonstrated that slight changes in the properties of unstable orbits, which cannot be distinguished using the Lyapunov exponent, could be detected when using the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.

We also verified numerically that the breaking of symmetry caused the probability density for Qm to become the function in Eq. (6.3). It is hoped that a distribution function that describes the symmetry violation may be found in the future. Further research on the statistical principle that determines the probability distribution function for generating symmetry violation is needed; thus, statistical mechanics which can describe chaotic motion that breaks the symmetry based on this principle should be constructed.
