Variational bounds for the shear viscosity of gelling melts

Introduction

The most prominent feature of a gelling (macro-) molecular liquid is the divergence of the static shear viscosity as the gelation transition is approached from the sol side. The melt becomes increasingly more viscous, reflecting larger and larger solid like regions and signalling the emergence of shear rigidity in the amorphous solid state of the gel. Many experiments have tried to measure the divergence of the shear viscosity quantitatively, yet the data are still very confusing.

The gelation transition is known to be a percolation transition, which is controlled by the crosslink density c, see e.g. [\cite=StCo82] for a review. It has been analysed with the tools of critical phenomena, in particular it has been verified that the cluster size distribution follows the scaling law f(n)  ~  n-  τ exp { - n / n*} if the distance to the critical point, [formula], is sufficiently small. Here n is the cluster size or more precisely the number of crosslinked monomers of a cluster. The quantity [formula] has the meaning of a "cut-off size" and σ and τ are critical exponents [\cite=StAh94].

The divergence of the static shear viscosity is usually analysed in terms of an algebraic singularity [formula] and a dynamic critical exponent k. However the values of k which have been deduced from experiment vary enormously - in contradiction to the concept of universal exponents put forward by the dynamic renormalisation group theory. To appreciate the scatter of the data we summarise the reported values for k in Table [\ref=data]. We have also included results from simulations in Table [\ref=data], based either on the bond-fluctuation model[\cite=GaAr00] or on molecular dynamics in combination with a soft pair potential[\cite=VePl01] [\cite=JePl03].

The origin of the broad scatter of the data is not understood at present. It has been suggested that there might be more than one universality class for the dynamic critical exponents. For example, in dense solutions hydrodynamic interactions play a crucial role, whereas in melts such interactions are absent. However, it is not obvious, how to group the above data into two universality classes. Another explanation for the scatter has evoked the size of the critical region, which shrinks with growing linear size of the crosslinked (macro-) molecules[\cite=DeGe77]. Consequently some experiments could be outside the critical region or measure crossover exponents.

In view of the controversial results it is highly desirable to obtain rigorous results for the divergence of the static shear viscosity. In this paper we consider a Rouse model, generalised to account for excluded-volume interactions, and derive an exact lower bound for η. This allows us to conclude that the viscosity diverges at least as strongly as the lower bound, implying the inequality [formula] for the critical exponent k. Here, ν and β are the critical exponents of percolation theory for the correlation length and the gel fraction. In d = 3 spatial dimensions the lower bound for the exponent implies [formula], in disagreement with several entries in Table [\ref=data]. Furthermore the lower bound exceeds the value for the critical exponent of the Rouse model without excluded volume, proving that excluded-volume interactions are indeed relevant for the dynamic critical behaviour. We also derive a lower bound for the case of a single (isolated) cluster with n monomers. This lower bound is found to agree with an upper bound, resulting in an exact expression for the shear viscosity [formula] for single clusters of fixed size n. If the radius of gyration scales with cluster size according to [formula], where [formula] is the Hausdorff fractal dimension for isolated clusters, then the single-cluster viscosity is shown to obey the Mark-Houwink scaling relation [formula].

Model

We consider a system of N identical particles at positions [formula] in a d-dimensional volume V. Permanent crosslinks connect M randomly chosen pairs of particles N  =  {(i1,j1),(i2,j2),...(iM,jM)}. The crosslinks are modelled by harmonic springs

[formula]

of typical length a. (Energies are measured in units of [formula]). A particular crosslink realisation N can be decomposed into L clusters of crosslinked particles: [formula]. The l-th cluster, Nl, contains Nl particles. All the particles interact via an isotropic pair potential

[formula]

which can be taken as a Lennard-Jones potential or just a as hard core to ensure excluded volume. The details of the potential are irrelevant for this paper. The total potential energy is the sum of the harmonic crosslinks and the excluded volume: [formula] .

Shear viscosity

We are interested in shear flow and impose an external velocity field which points in the x-direction and increases linearly with y: [formula]. Here κ denotes the shear rate which is taken time independent because we aim to compute the static shear viscosity. In the following we shall need the symmetrised external flow field [formula] with Kνμ: = (δν,xδμ,y  +  δν,yδμ,x) / 2 and summation over repeated Greek indices implied. The monomers of the melt perform a Brownian motion on a semi-microscopic scale. The monomer configuration at time t is then described by the N-particle probability density [formula], which obeys the time-dependent Fokker-Planck or Smoluchowski equation [\cite=DoEd86]

[formula]

Here ζ > 0 denotes the friction constant.

The external velocity field builds up stresses in the system. Following Kirkwood, they are described by the stress tensor [formula] with components [\cite=DoEd86]

[formula]

The stress tensor is proportional to the monomer density ρ, and the brackets [formula] indicate the thermal average over particle positions with respect to the suitably normalised stationary solution [formula] of ([\ref=smol-eq]) in the presence of a shear flow. Note that the stress tensor as defined in ([\ref=stress]) is symmetric. The intrinsic linear-response viscosity is obtained from the stress tensor ([\ref=stress]) as η: =  lim κ  →  0σxy / (ρκ).

In order to determine the shear viscosity η within linear response, we follow [\cite=Fix83] and expand the stationary probability density [formula] in powers of the shear rate. The zeroth-order term is given by the canonical equilibrium state [formula]. In order to ensure the correct normalisation of [formula] we require [formula], where [formula] denotes the thermal average over [formula] weighted by [formula]. The above expansion allows us to express the linear viscosity as an average over the equilibrium distribution in two alternative forms

[formula]

Here only the symmetrised external flow field enters, even if the externally imposed flow is not symmetric. This is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the stress tensor as defined in ([\ref=stress]).

All the difficulties in the computation of η are hidden in the stationary non-equilibrium distribution φ. In this paper we shall follow Fixman[\cite=Fix83] and derive variational bounds for η which circumvent the exact knowledge of φ. Instead a guess for φ will serve as a test function in the variational principle with the quality of the bounds depending strongly on the chosen test function. To get a first hint, we consider the simpler case without excluded-volume interactions ("phantom clusters"), which can be solved exactly for the viscosity. In this case the centre of mass positions of the clusters

[formula]

follow the external flow field, giving rise to a nonzero current in the stationary state. The stationary distribution [formula] depends only on the particle positions relative to the centre of mass of the cluster to which they belong, i.e. on [formula]. It is explicitly given by [formula] with

[formula]

Inserting ([\ref=phi-x]) into ([\ref=eta]) and using isotropy, we recover the result

[formula]

for the viscosity of the Rouse model for gelling polymers [\cite=BrLo99] [\cite=BrLo01] [\cite=LoMu05b] in terms of the cluster-weighted sum of the squared radii of gyration

[formula]

Bounds for the viscosity

To derive a lower bound for the viscosity in the presence of excluded-volume interactions, we define the functional

[formula]

for smooth scalar fields [formula]. With help of the two alternative expressions for the viscosity ([\ref=eta]), the latter can be represented as η  =  F(φ) / N. Functional differentiation of F with respect to [formula] shows that its global maximum is attained for [formula]. Hence [formula] for any choice of the test function [formula]. Choosing the exact solution φ× of the phantom case yields a lower bound for the polymers with excluded volume

[formula]

where we used isotropy.

Fixman [\cite=Fix83] has also given an upper bound for the viscosity

[formula]

in terms of N test vector fields [formula], [formula], subject to the divergence condition

[formula]

The problem with this estimate lies in the difficulty to find test fields that satisfy condition ([\ref=u-cond]). The upper bound would match the lower bound ([\ref=eta-lb-x]) precisely, if we chose uνi  =  KνμδRμi. However this choice in general does not fulfil condition ([\ref=u-cond]) due to excluded-volume interactions between monomers in different clusters. The above test field is a valid choice for a system which consists just of a single cluster N. In that case the upper bound ([\ref=eta-ub]) coincides with the lower bound ([\ref=eta-lb-x]) and the equality

[formula]

holds exactly. The additional subscript 's' of the thermal average indicates that there are no other degrees of freedom besides the positions of the monomers in the cluster to be averaged--in contrast to the average in ([\ref=eta-lb-x]), which includes all monomers from all clusters. Eq. ([\ref=eta-N]) has been suggested on a phenomenological basis in the context of scaling arguments [\cite=CoGi93] [\cite=MaAd88] [\cite=Gen78] [\cite=Gen79b] [\cite=Cat85] [\cite=Mut85] [\cite=RuCo89] [\cite=ArSa90] [\cite=Sa94], which relate the viscosity to the longest time scale and the latter to the clusters' linear dimension [formula] and the diffusion constant.

Disorder average over crosslinks

To obtain the viscosity of the macroscopic polymeric melt, we have to perform the macroscopic limit N  →    ∞   and average over different crosslink realisations. We focus on gelling systems for which the appropriate crosslink ensemble is given by d-dimensional lattice-bond percolation with bond probability c / d, corresponding to the crosslink concentration c. We denote this combined procedure by an overbar [formula]. For the viscosity of a polymeric melt, Eq. ([\ref=eta-lb-x]) yields the lower bound

[formula]

with f(n) denoting the cluster-size distribution and [formula] the (normalised) partial average obtained from restricting [formula] to clusters of fixed size n. Next we employ the scaling description of bond percolation for [formula] to compute critical exponents. In particular, the percolation average of the radius of gyration of n-clusters is known to obey the scaling relation [\cite=StAh94]

[formula]

with the fractal dimension [formula]. It is experimentally well confirmed (e.g. in [\cite=AdLa91] [\cite=YiEr98]) and generally accepted [\cite=StCo82] [\cite=MaAd91] that the scaling [\eqref=r2scal] with the same fractal dimension also applies to gelation clusters with excluded-volume interactions in a melt. Moreover, on the theoretical side, thermostatic properties of vulcanization clusters at criticality were shown to fall into the universality class of lattice-bond percolation [\cite=PeGo00]. Thus, when inserting [\eqref=r2scal] into ([\ref=eta-result]), we obtain that the averaged viscosity of the polydisperse melt diverges with a critical exponent

[formula]

at the sol-gel transition. We recall that throughout our calculations we have not made any assumptions on the detailed nature of the excluded-volume potential.

On the other hand, if excluded-volume interactions were absent, the geometric fractal dimension [formula] would take on the Gaussian or ideal Rouse value [formula]. The resulting lower bound for k would then coincide with the exact result in the phantom case that was computed previously [\cite=BrLo99] [\cite=BrLo01] [\cite=LoMu05b].

Finally, we turn to the viscosity ([\ref=eta-N]) of a single cluster with excluded-volume interactions that has been isolated from a gelling melt. On average, we get

[formula]

which is an exact result. For single clusters isolated from critical melts, ([\ref=eta-Nav]) implies the Mark-Houwink relation [formula] with the fractal dimension [formula] for a single cluster. Whereas for clusters in the melt the excluded volume interaction is (partially) screened, this is not the case for an isolated cluster, resulting in a lower value of [formula] as compared to [formula]. A generalisation of Flory's argument to clusters [\cite=Lubensky] suggests [formula]. This exponent value is observed in light-scattering experiments for solutions obtained from diluting a polydisperse melt [\cite=MaKe86] [\cite=AdLa97] [\cite=LeNi99].

Discussion and outlook

The exact lower bound for the critical exponent is definitely in disagreement with several entries in Table [\ref=data]. For simulations or experiments referring to a melt, the only way out are effects due to entanglements (besides crossover effects due to a tiny critical region). Entanglement effects cannot be ruled out, but are generally not expected to play a vital role on the sol side of the transition - quite in contrast to the well crosslinked gel phase, where entanglement effects due to interlocking loops are clearly important[\cite=EvKr95] [\cite=EvKr96].

As far as dense solutions are concerned, one needs to consider hydrodynamic interactions due to the presence of a solvent. It seems feasible to include pre-averaged hydrodynamic interactions in the variational approach pursued here. This may provide a semi-microscopic starting point for the computation of upper and lower bounds for viscosities for solutions of gelling polymers. Such bounds are all the more interesting, because a dense solution of gelling phantom polymers is known to behave completely unphysically, showing a finite viscosity at the sol-gel transition [\cite=LoMu05a].
