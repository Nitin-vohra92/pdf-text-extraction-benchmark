Genocchi Numbers and f-Vectors of Simplicial Balls

Introduction

The aim of this note is to investigate f-vectors of simplicial balls, especially the relations between interior and boundary faces. For a simplicial ball B we denote by fi(B) the number of i-dimensional faces. The boundary ∂B of B is a simplicial sphere with face numbers fi(∂B). We also define [formula] although the interior [formula] of B is not a polyhedral complex.

For simplicial spheres the Dehn-Sommerville relations give non-trivial dependences for the f-vector. McMullen and Walkup gave in [\cite=MR0298557] a similar equation for simplicial balls which relates the f-vector of the boundary ∂B with the f-vector of B (see also Billera and Bj�rner [\cite=MR1730171] and Klain [\cite=Klain]). The most important examples of simplicial balls are triangulated polytopes. Special interest on connections between the f-vector of the boundary and the interior occurs for example when the polytope is simplicial and so the f-vector of the boundary is fixed (see McMullen [\cite=MR2070631]), but also in other cases, e.g. for triangulations without interior edges of low dimension [\cite=HJ].

The f-vector of the interior of a simplicial ball occurs in the study of the combinatorics of certain unbounded polyhedra [\cite=HJ]: It is dual to the f-vector of the polyhedral complex of their bounded faces. A very important special case is the tight span of a finite metric space [\cite=MR753872] [\cite=HJ].

We will give a relation between the f-vector of the boundary and the interior of a simplicial ball directly in terms of the f-vector of the interior. The most interesting point about our equation is the occurrence of the Genocchi numbers G2n:

The proof of this theorem is given in Section 3, while Section 2 collects basic facts about the Genocchi numbers.

Genocchi Numbers

The Genocchi numbers (Sequence A001469 in Sloane [\cite=OEIS]) are defined by means of the generating function

[formula]

Their investigation goes back to Leonhard Euler while the term Genocchi numbers (after the Italian mathematician Angelo Genocchi (1817-1889)) was presumably introduced by Edouard Lucas in [\cite=Lucas]. Intensive studies on these numbers were done by Eric T. Bell in the 1920s [\cite=MR1501336] [\cite=MR1501490].

The Genocchi numbers are directly related to the much more famous Bernoulli numbers Bn via Gn = 2(1 - 22n)Bn. There is also a combinatorial interpretation which is due to Dominique Dumont [\cite=MR0337643]: The absolute value of G2n + 2 equals the number of permutations τ of [formula] such that τ(i) > i if and only if i is odd. There is a continuing interest in the Genocchi numbers and especially their generalizations (see e.g. [\cite=MR2020979] [\cite=MR2110777] [\cite=MR2206473]).

There are a lot of possibilities of computing the values of the Genocchi numbers (see for example [\cite=MR2110777] [\cite=MR1771988] [\cite=TT], and also the entry in [\cite=OEIS] for further references). Here we need two other formulae which are obtained by differentiating [\eqref=gn] and comparing the coefficients of even and odd powers of t respectively.

For the Genocchi numbers we have the recursion formulae

[formula]

Additionally, we will use the following technical lemma:

For n  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

First we remark that the second part of Proposition [\ref=prop:genocchi] yields

[formula]

for all [formula]. Then we use the first part of Proposition [\ref=prop:genocchi] and compute

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1

To prove our main theorem we use a variation of the Dehn-Sommerville relations by Klain [\cite=Klain] for arbitrary triangulated manifolds with boundary. The following is a reformulation of [\cite=Klain]. (Note that there is a typing error in Klain's version: the - 1 in the exponent of - 1 should be left out.)

For each simplicial (n - 1)-ball B and n - k even we have

[formula]

Now we can give the proof of our main result.

The claim is trivial for k = n so we may assume that it holds for k' > k. For simplicity we also assume that n (and thus k) is even. The case n odd is analogous. Thus we compute

[formula]

Where in (*  ) we used the computation

[formula]

If we now consider a simplicial (n - 1)-ball B without any interior faces of dimension up to e we derive from this theorem the equations

[formula]

for n - k even and k  ≤  e. So we have ⌊(e + 2) / 2⌋ (⌊(e + 3) / 2⌋) equations for the ⌊(n - 1 - e) / 2⌋ (⌊(n - e) / 2⌋) unknowns [formula] with n - k odd for n even and odd respectively. This is an f-vector analog of Proposition 3.4 in [\cite=HJ].
