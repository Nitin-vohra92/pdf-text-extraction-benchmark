Complex asystatic actions of compact Lie groups

Introduction

A proper action of a compact Lie group K on a manifold M is called asystatic if the isotropy representation of a principal isotropy subgroup L has no non-trivial fixed vector in the tangent space of a principal orbit K / L, or, equivalently, if the quotient group NK(L) / L is finite. Asystatic actions are particular cases of polar actions, namely, if we endow M with any K-invariant Riemannian metric, there exists a properly embedded submanifold Σ, called a section, which intersects every K-orbit orthogonally; in the case of asystatic actions, a section is provided by the fixed point set of a principal isotropy. Asystatic actions, whose introduction goes back to Lie (see [\cite=LE]), have been treated in [\cite=AA] and [\cite=PT]. If K acts isometrically and holomorphically on a Kähler manifold M, then the asystatic condition is rarely satisfied, at least when the action is Hamiltonian, as the following proposition shows.

Let K acts effectively on a Kähler manifold M by holomorphic isometries. If the K-action is Hamiltonian, then it is asystatic if and only if K is semisimple and M is the Kähler product of a flag K / H and a Kähler manifold which is acted on trivially by K.

Now, given a K-action on a manifold M with principal isotropy type (L), the core [formula] is defined as the closure of [formula], where ML denotes the fixed point set of the subgroup L. The quotient group NK(L) / L acts effectively on [formula] and the inclusion [formula] induces a bijection at the orbit space level; this gives the primary motivation for referring to the induced transformation group [formula] as the reduction of (K,M) (see e.g. [\cite=GS] and [\cite=SS]).

In this paper we are interested in the fixed point set of a principal isotropy for a Hamiltonian action of a compact group of holomorphic isometries K of a Kähler manifold M; in this case one of our results states the following

Let M be a Kähler manifold endowed with an effective Hamiltonian K-action. Let (L) be a principal isotropy type, [formula] a core and c the cohomogeneity of the K-action. Then

[formula];

the equality in (1) holds if and only if the group (NK(L) / L)o is abelian;

if M = V is a linear space and K acts linearly on V or M is locally irreducible, then [formula].

It is therefore natural to investigate actions for which this equality holds. With this notation we say that a proper K-Hamiltonian action on a Kähler manifold M by holomorphic isometries is called complex asystatic (or [formula]-asystatic) if

[formula]

or, equivalently, if (NK(L) / L)o is abelian.

In the algebraic setting we prove the following theorem, which connects the [formula]-asystatic condition with the class of actions of reductive groups with spherical orbits; we recall here that a complex homogeneous space N of a reductive complex group G is called spherical if a Borel subgroup of G has an open orbit in N (see e.g. [\cite=BLV]). All irreducible representations of a reductive algebraic group G with spherical orbits have been classified by Arzhantsev ([\cite=A2]). In the last section we therefore use this result and our Theorem [\ref=spherical] in order to determine all the irreducible [formula]-asystatic representations. Our result is the following We note here that the actions appearing in the classification are either orbit equivalent to isotropy representations of Hermitian symmetric spaces or are obtained from these by deleting the one-dimensional torus.

The organization of the paper is as follows: definitions and basic useful facts on complex asystatic actions are given in Section 2, while in Section 3 we prove our main result in the algebraic setting. Applying our main result we give, in Section 4, the complete classification of irreducible complex asystatic representations.

Actions on Kähler manifolds and the [formula]-asystatic condition

Throughout the following K will denote a connected compact Lie group. A proper K-action on a manifold M is said to be asystatic if, given a principal point p∈M and its isotropy subgroup Kp: = L, the isotropy representation of L on Tp(K  ·  p) has no nontrivial fixed vector.

If M is a Kähler manifold and K acts on M by holomorphic isometries, the asystatic condition is rarely satisfied, at least if K acts in Hamiltonian fashion. We now give the proof of Prop[\ref=flag] (for some related see also [\cite=GP]).

Let L be a principal isotropy subgroup and let Σ be the connected component of the fixed point set ML passing through the principal point p. Then [formula] and since Σ is complex, so is K  ·  p. We now claim that every K-orbit is complex. Indeed, Σ intersects every K-orbit and for every q∈Σ we have that TqΣ is a section for the linear Kq-action on the normal space νq of K  ·  q (see e.g. [\cite=PT]); moreover if v∈νq, there exists g∈Kq so that gv∈TqΣ, hence Jv∈g- 1TqΣ  ⊂  νq since Σ is complex. This means that νq, hence K  ·  q is complex.

Since the K-action is Hamiltonian, the Z-action on K  ·  p is also Hamiltonian, where Z denotes the connected component of the center of K; this implies that Z acts trivially on K  ·  p, hence on M by the effectiveness of the action, and therefore K is semisimple.

If [formula] is a moment map for the K-action, where [formula] denotes the dual of the Lie algebra of K, we first note that μ is constant on Σ, because Σ is complex and therefore 〈dμq(X),Y〉  =  ω(X,Ŷ)|q  =  0 for every [formula] and q∈Σ. We put μ(Σ)  =  {β} for some [formula]. If x∈Σ, then K  ·  x is complex, hence μ:K  ·  x  →  K  ·  β is a covering and since K  ·  β is simply connected, we have Kx = Kβ and every K-orbit in M is principal. This also implies that Σ intersects every K-orbit in a single point: indeed if x,gx∈Σ for some g∈K, then g∈Kβ = Kx, hence x = gx. The map φ:K  ·  p  ×  Σ  →  M given by φ(kp,x) = kx where p is any fixed point in Σ is a well defined K-equivariant diffeomorphism, which can be proved to be an isometry using the same arguments as in the proof of the main result in [\cite=GP].

From now on we will always suppose that the K-action is also Hamiltonian.Given a K-action on a manifold M with principal isotropy type (L), recall that the core [formula] is defined as the closure of [formula] and it is known (see [\cite=GS] and [\cite=SS]) that all the components of [formula] are equi-dimensional. We now give the proof of Prop. [\ref=inequality].

(1) We denote by [formula] a moment map, where [formula] is the Lie algebra of K, identified with its dual [formula] by means of a Ad(K)-invariant scalar product <    ·  ,  ·    >   on [formula]. We fix a point p∈ML and, since principal isotropy subgroups are conjugate, we may suppose that p belongs also to the open dense subset [formula]. Then it is known (see [\cite=HW], p.267) that, given a K-regular point p∈M with Kp  =  L, L is normal in Kμ(p) with Kμ(p) / L abelian; moreover the kernel [formula] is a L-invariant subspace of Tp(K  ·  p), which can be identified with the tangent space Tp(Kμ(p)  ·  p). This implies that

[formula]

and also that [formula]. Since the normal space [formula] with respect to any K-invariant scalar product on M is obviously contained in (TpM)L because p is regular, we obtain our first claim, recalling that [formula] (2) The fixed point set (K  ·  p)L clearly identifies with the orbit NK(L)  ·  p and the equality holds if and only if dim (Tp(NK(L)  ·  p))  =   dim Kμ(p)  ·  p, i.e. if and only if (NK(L) / L)o  =  Kμ(p) / L, which is abelian. (3) Suppose that [formula]; this implies that L = Kμ(p) because Kμ(p) / L is abelian. Since L has maximal rank, [formula]; moreover since VL contains the normal space of the orbit K  ·  p at p, we see that VL coincides with [formula] and therefore the orbit K  ·  p is complex. In particular, since the K-action is Hamiltonian, the group K is semisimple by the same arguments used in the proof of Prop. [\ref=flag]. If M = V is a linear space, then K  ·  p is a compact connected complex submanifold, hence a point and the K-action is trivial. Suppose now that M is a locally irreducible Kähler manifold. We write [formula], an [formula]-invariant decomposition, where [formula] identifies with Tp(K  ·  p); we decompose [formula] into irreducible [formula]-invariant subspaces, which are mutually inequivalent, because K / L is a generalized flag manifold of a semisimple compact Lie group (see e.g. [\cite=W]). If ξ∈VL, then the shape operator Aξ, viewed as an element of [formula], commutes with [formula] and therefore maps each [formula] into itself; being self-adjoint, we have that [formula] for some [formula] by Schur's Lemma. Moreover, the complex structure J of V leaves each [formula] invariant and therefore commutes with Aξ; on the other hand it is well-known (see [\cite=KN]) that Aξ anti-commutes with J, hence Aξ  =  0 for all ξ∈VL, meaning that every principal orbit is totally geodesic. The open subset of principal points admits two complementary, totally geodesic foliations, given by the K-orbits and by the fixed point sets of principal isotropies; it is well-known that two complementary totally geodesic foliations are parallel, contradicting the local irreducibility of M.

Example. On the quadric [formula], we consider the action of [formula]. A principal isotropy subgroup L is given by [formula] and [formula], hence the action is [formula]-asystatic.

The example [formula] acting on [formula] shows that NK(L) / L is in general not abelian, even if the action is [formula]-asystatic; indeed in this case [formula].

The following proposition shows that the condition of [formula]-asystatic is preserved in the slice representation at complex orbits.

If the K-action on M is [formula]-asystatic then the slice representation at a complex K-orbit is [formula]-asystatic.

We now close this section with the following lemma that might be useful in order to classify [formula]-asystatic actions.

Let K be a compact connected Lie group acting on a Kähler manifold M and K'  ⊂  K a compact connected subgroup whose action on M is [formula]-asystatic, then the action of K is [formula]-asystatic, provided one of the following conditions holds:

K and K' have the same orbits;

[formula], where [formula] is a one dimensional torus.

We remark that if K'  ⊂  K have the same orbits and the K-action is [formula]-asystatic, then the K'-action is not necessarily [formula]-asystatic, as the example of the linear action of [formula] shows.

[formula]-asystatic actions and spherical orbits

In this section we prove our main Theorem [\ref=spherical]. We recall here that a complex homogeneous space X  =  G / H, where G is a complex algebraic group, is called spherical if a Borel subgroup of G has an open orbit in X. We recall also that if (M,g) is a Kähler manifold with Kähler form ω and K is a compact connected Lie subgroup of its full isometry group, then the K-action is called coisotropic if the principal K-orbits are coisotropic with respect to ω.

Let K be a maximal compact Lie subgroup of G whose action on M is Hamiltonian. Let [formula] be a moment map for the K-action and let [formula]. Since Mμ is an open set, the intersection [formula] is non empty and open; we fix p in [formula] and we denote by O the orbit G  ·  p under the complexified group G. We now prove that the orbit K  ·  p is coisotropic in O, hence every principal orbit of K in O will be coisotropic by Theorem 3 in [\cite=HW]. By a result due to Wurzbacher (Theorem 2.1, p. 542 [\cite=Wu]) this means that the G-orbit O is spherical. In order to prove our claim, we denote by [formula] the tangent space Tp(Kμ(p)  ·  p) and by [formula] the orthogonal complement [formula]; by the assumption of [formula]-asystatic, the fixed point set (TpM)L is given by [formula], where νp denotes the normal space [formula]; since TpML is a complex subspace, we have that [formula] is complex too. This means that TpO is given by [formula], where J denotes the complex structure of M, so that the normal space of Tp(K  ·  p) inside TpO is [formula]; hence the orbit K  ·  p is coisotropic inside O. This argument shows that for any point x in the open set [formula] the orbit G  ·  x is spherical; our claim now follows from [\cite=A1], where it is proved that every G-orbit is spherical if this happens in an open dense subset.

In the following we will denote by G / H a G-spherical orbit and by NG(H) the normalizer of H in G, using [\cite=Vi] (Proposition 10, p. 19), under the same hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=spherical], we get

If the action of a compact Lie subgroup of G on M is [formula]-asystatic then NG(H) / H is abelian.

The linear Case

All representations of a reductive algebraic group G with spherical orbits have been classified in [\cite=A2]. In order to have the classification of [formula]-asystatic representations, we have to go through the list in [\cite=A2] and select which are [formula]-asystatic. Since the computation of a principal isotropy is not easily accessible in the literature, we provide a table of all irreducible representations with spherical orbits, where we also indicate a principal isotropy L. We now give the proof of the classification Theorem.

By Theorem  [\ref=spherical], we know that the G-orbits are spherical. By Arzhantsev's result [\cite=A2], an irreducible representation of a reductive algebraic group has spherical orbits if and only if it appears in Table I (p. 291 in  [\cite=A2]) or is obtained from any of these by a torus extension; here in Table 1, we indicate a compact real form K with the corresponding representation, a principal isotropy subgroup L, the difference [formula] and the dimension d of the fixed point set for the isotropy action of L on the tangent space of the orbit K / L. Clearly, the representation is [formula]-asystatic if and only if f = d. According to Lemma [\ref=extension], we then need only consider the cases which are not [formula]-asystatic and compute the same invariants f and d for [formula]; this is done in Table 2 and the full classification is then obtained by taking all representations which appear in Table 1 or 2 and are [formula]-asystatic.
