Vacuum decay by p-branes production

Introduction

Vacuum decay can be seen as a phase transition in spacetime and a long time ago the relevance of gravity for the process was studied [\cite=bib:ColDeL]. The standard treatment of this process makes use of a scalar field, known as the inflaton, that drives the transition between the false and true vacuum states. This situation can be described by instanton calculations as, for instance, the Coleman-de Luccia and the Hawking-Moss instantons.

Here we present a different approach, generalizing past works of one of the authors [\cite=reviews] [\cite=cqsdvd]. In particular we are going to use (anti-)de Sitter solutions in N spacetime dimensions. In this background we put a spherically symmetric (N - 1)-brane that splits spacetime into two domains. The system can be described by Israel junction conditions [\cite=Israel], which provide the equations of motion for the timelike brane. The associated solutions are of two kinds: the first one consists of a degenerate brane of zero radius, while the second one consists of a bounce brane collapsing from infinity towards a finite nonzero turning point, and then re-expanding. To model vacuum decay we consider the tunnelling from the zero radius solution to the bounce solution. The corresponding physical picture is the following: a very small brane inside a de Sitter geometry with cosmological constant Λ+, due to quantum effects, has a non-vanishing probability to tunnel into a brane, containing a de Sitter spacetime with a different cosmological constant Λ-. This represents the formation of a bubble of a different vacuum phase that then expands to infinity, realizing a transition of the whole spacetime geometry. We can obtain an expression for the probability of such a process using an effective action for this system.

Classical Dynamics

The stress-energy tensor for a distribution of matter localized on an hypersurface Σ (the p-brane we mentioned above) can be written in the form Sμνδ(η), where δ is a Dirac delta, and η can be thought as a transverse coordinate to Σ. In N-dimensional General Relativity it is possible to write down the equations of motion for this infinitesimally thin distribution of matter by splitting Einstein equations in the tangential and transverse part (see [\cite=Israel] for the 4-dimensional case; it can be extended to higher dimensions). Israel junction conditions, then, are

[formula]

where Kij and K are, respectively, the extrinsic curvature tensor and its trace and hij is the induced metric on Σ. Here we introduced the standard notation [formula]. Israel junction conditions describe how the (N - 1)-brane is embedded in the (in principle different) geometries of the two spacetime domains that it separates. For our purposes, we are going to write down these equations for a spherical brane with surface stress energy tensor Sij  =  khij separating two de Sitter spacetimes. This can be done explicitly in terms of the radius R of the brane. Then Israel junction conditions reduce to the single differential equation

[formula]

k is the constant tension of the brane, ε are signs to be determined by the equation itself [\cite=tesi], and f(R) = 1  -  ΛR2 is the metric function appearing in the static line element adapted to the spherical symmetry for the (anti-)de Sitter spacetime. For suitable values of the cosmological constants equation ([\ref=eq:sphjuncon]) has two types of solutions: the first is [formula], while the second represents a brane collapsing and re-expanding from and to infinity. For our purpose it is also important to note that equation ([\ref=eq:sphjuncon]) can also be obtained by an effective action, which in the N-dimensional case can be written as

[formula]

with the additional constraint H  =  0 that has to be imposed on the solutions of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation [\cite=tesi].

Tunnelling

The action ([\ref=eq:actfun]) is crucial in our semiclassical quantization program, since it can be used to quantize the system via a path integral approach. Here we are going to consider the tunnelling process from the [formula] solution to the bounce solution, within the saddle-point approximation. This gives the possibility to estimate the following approximated amplitude

[formula]

where [formula] is the Euclidean effective action obtained by analytically continuing the action ([\ref=eq:actfun]) to the Euclidean sector. In order to simplify some expressions, we introduce the following adimensional quantities: Moreover it is a well known result that the adimensional version of the equation of motion ([\ref=eq:sphjuncon]) can be cast in the following form

[formula]

where the prime now denotes the derivative with respect the adimensional time t. The potential V(x) is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the adimensional turning radius, provided that the argument of the square root is positive. If this condition holds, there is a bounce trajectory, otherwise we have only the x = 0 solution. Starting from ([\ref=eq:actfun]), ([\ref=eq:eucact]) and ([\ref=eq:effpot]) it is possible to evaluate the Euclidean action on the tunnelling trajectory, i.e on the segment

[formula]

Conclusions

In this contribution we have summarized how it is possible to compute the tunnelling amplitude for a spherical p-brane: the process, in view of our short discussion in the introduction, can be used to model the transition between two different vacuum phases, one being the de Sitter spacetime with cosmological constant Λ+ and the other being the inflating inside of the p-brane, which is characterized by the cosmological constant Λ-. This computation was already performed in four dimensions in the seminal work by Coleman and de Luccia [\cite=bib:ColDeL] and that result was reproduced in [\cite=cqsdvd]. Here we have carried out its generalization to arbitrary dimensions (referring to [\cite=bib:SinAnsToPub] for a more detailed analysis).
