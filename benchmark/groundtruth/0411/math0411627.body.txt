Minimal hypersurfaces with zero Gauss-Kronecker curvature

Introduction

A classical result of Beez-Killing states that a hypersurface Mn in the Euclidean space Rn + 1 is rigid if the rank of the Gauss map is at least 3. Dajczer and Gromoll in [\cite=DG] developed a powerful method, the so called "Gauss parametrization", which has interesting applications in the study of rigidity problems in the case where the rank is at least 2. The essential point of this method is that it provides a parametrization for every hypersurface with second fundamental form of constant nullity by inverting the Gauss map. The local rigidity of minimal hypersurfaces with nullity n - 2 is well understood. In fact, Dajczer and Gromoll [\cite=DG], show that such hypersurfaces allow locally an one-parameter family of isometric deformations, the so called associated family. Hence, the rigidity of minimal hypersurfaces make sense under global assumptions. Among others, Dajczer and Gromoll in [\cite=DG] proved the following global rigidity result: If Mn [formula] is a complete Riemannian manifold which does not have Rn - 3 as a factor, then every minimal immersion f:Mn  →  Rn + 1 is rigid as a minimal submanifold of Rn + p for any p  ≥  1. This is proved by establishing an interesting criterion for a complete hypersurface Mn in Rn + 1 to split as a Euclidean product Mn = L3  ×  Rn - 3. However, the case of dimension n = 3 is left open.

The aim of the present paper is to fill in the gap for n = 3, by studying complete minimal hypersurfaces in R4 with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero. One can easily construct complete minimal hypersurfaces with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero in R4 just by erecting cylinders over complete minimal surfaces in R3. In fact, let [formula] be a complete minimal surface. Denote by λ, -  λ its principal curvatures and by a a unit vector in [formula] normal to R3. Then the cylinder f:M3 = M2  ×  R  →  R4, [formula], is a complete minimal hypersurface in R4 with principal curvatures k1  =  λ, k2 = 0, k3 =  - λ. The scalar curvature of M3 is equal to the Gaussian curvature of M2. Observe that, the cylinder over the helicoid in R3 gives a non-totally geodesic complete minimal hypersurface in R4, with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero, three distinct principal curvatures and scalar curvature bounded from below. Also, we note that there are complete minimal surfaces in R3 having their Gaussian curvature not bounded from below [\cite=Na]. So, erecting the cylinder over those surfaces, one can produce complete minimal hypersurfaces in R4 with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero and scalar curvature not bounded from below. However, to the best of our knowledge,  the cylinders are the only known examples of complete minimal hypersurfaces with Gauss-Kronecker identically zero in R4. This led us to the following

Question: It is true that any complete minimal hypersurface with vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature in R4 is a cylinder over a minimal surface in R3?

We shall give here a partial answer to this question under some additional assumptions on the scalar curvature. In particular, we prove the following

Let M3 be an oriented, 3-dimensional, complete Riemannian manifold and f:M3  →  R4 a minimal isometric immersion with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero and nowhere vanishing second fundamental form. If the scalar curvature is bounded from below, then [formula] splits as a Euclidean product L2  ×  R, where L2 is a complete minimal surface in R3 with Gaussian curvature bounded from below.

Remark: It is clear that the cylinders in Theorem 1 are not rigid.

Recently Cheng [\cite=C] proved that complete minimal hypersurfaces in R4 with scalar curvature bounded from below and constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature, have identically zero Gauss-Kronecker curvature. Also he gave an example of a minimal hypersurface in R4 with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero which is in fact a cone shaped hypersurface over the Clifford torus in S3 and certainly is not complete. Motivated by these facts, we consider complete minimal hypersurfaces in R4 with constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature and prove that this constant must be zero without any assumption on the scalar curvature. The key of the proof is the powerful Principal Curvature Theorem proved by Smyth and Xavier in [\cite=SX]. More precisely, we prove the following

Let M3 be an oriented, 3-dimensional, complete Riemannian manifold and f:M3  →  R4 a minimal isometric immersion with constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature. Then the Gauss-Kronecker curvature is identically zero.

Preliminaries

Let f:M3  →  R4 be an oriented minimal hypersurface equipped with the induced metric and unit normal vector field ξ along f. Denote by A the shape operator associated with ξ and by k1  ≥  k2  ≥  k3 the principal curvatures. The Gauss-Kronecker curvature K and the scalar curvature τ are given by Assume now that the second fundamental form is nowhere vanishing. Then the principal curvatures satisfies the relation k1  =  λ > k2 = 0 > k3 =  - λ, where λ is a smooth positive function on M3. We can choose locally an orthonormal frame field [formula] of principal directions corresponding to λ,0, - λ. Let [formula] and [formula], i,j∈{1,2,3}, be the corresponding dual and the connection forms. Throughout this paper we make the following convection for indices and adopt the method of moving frames. The structure equations are

[formula]

Consider the functions which will play an crucial role in the proof of Theorem 1. From the structural equations, and the Codazzi equations, we easily get and

[formula]

Furthermore, the above equations yield

[formula]

Proofs

We shall use in the proof of Theorem 1 a result due to S.Y Cheng and S.T Yau [\cite=CY] that we recall in the following lemma. For the reader's convenience we shall include a brief proof, following Nishikawa [\cite=N].

Lemma. Let Mn be an n-dimensional, n  ≥  2, complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature [formula], where k is a positive constant. Suppose that g is a smooth non-negative function on Mn satisfying

[formula]

where c is a positive constant and Δ stands for the Laplacian operator. Then g vanishes identically.

Proof. Take a point x0∈Mn. If g attains its maximum at x0 then [formula] and the result is true. We shall prove that [formula] for any point x∈M3. Suppose in the contrary, that there exists a point x1 such that [formula]. We set [formula] and denote by [formula] the geodesic ball of radius a centered at x0, where d is the distance on M3. We consider the function [formula], [formula], where a > β and [formula]. Since [formula] and G is non-negative we deduce that G attains its maximum at some point [formula]. First let us assume that x2 is not a cut point of x0. Then G is smooth near x2 and by the maximum principle we have

[formula]

It is well known that [formula] since the Ricci curvature is bounded from below by [formula]. Then from (4), we get

[formula]

Assume now that x2 is a cut point of x0. Let σ be a unit speed segment from x0 to x2 and [formula] such that [formula], for sufficiently small ε > 0. Then the function [formula] is smooth near x2 and the function is a "support function" of G, i.e. [formula], [formula]. Thus Gε attains its maximum at x2. Proceeding as before and passing to the limit we get the same estimate as in (5). Since x2 is the maximum point of G in [formula] we have [formula] and thus

[formula]

Since Mn is complete, letting a  →    ∞  , from (6), we get [formula] which is a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem 1. Without loss of generality we may assume that M3 is simply connected, after passing to the universal covering space. Since M3 is simply connected, the standard monodromy argument allows us to define a global orthonormal frame field [formula] of principal directions. The assumptions of Theorem 1 imply that M3 has three distinct principal curvatures λ > 0 >  - λ, and Ricci curvature bounded from below. The functions u and v are well defined on entire M3. Moreover, we claim that u and v are harmonic functions. Indeed,

[formula]

Making use of (1), we get

[formula]

Therefore, taking (2) into account, we obtain

[formula]

In a similar way, we verify that Δu = 0.

Using (1), and the fact that Δv = Δu = 0 we get

[formula]

Thus, Appealing to the Lemma, we infer that u2 + v2 is identically zero. Thus [formula] and λ is constant along the integral curves of e2. Consider the 2-dimensional distribution V which is spanned by e1 and e3. Because [formula], from (2) we see that V is involutive. Let L2x be a maximal integral submanifold of V passing through a point x of M3, and denote by i:L2x  →  M3 its inclusion map. Then [formula] defines an immersion. Let A1 and A2 be the shape operators of [formula] in the directions [formula] and ξ, respectively. A direct calculation shows that A1 = 0 and with respect to the basis [formula]. Thus, [formula] is a minimal surface with bounded Gaussian curvature which lies in [formula] and [formula] is constant along [formula]. Hence [formula] splits as we wished, and this completes the proof of theorem.

Proof of Theorem 2. We can choose an orientation such that k1 > 0 > k2  ≥  k3. According to the Principal Curvature Theorem due to Smyth and Xavier [\cite=SX], we have [formula], where Λ is the set of values assumed by the non-zero principal curvatures. Hence there exists a secuence of points [formula] such that [formula]. From the minimality we get [formula], i = 2,3 and consequently the Gauss-Kronecker curvature satisfies [formula]. Thus K is zero, and this completes the proof.
