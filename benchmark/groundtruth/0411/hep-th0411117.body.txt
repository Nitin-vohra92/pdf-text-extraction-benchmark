Edge solitons in the QHE

Reduction of Chern-Simons

The Landau-Ginzburg theory of the Quantum Hall Effect [\cite=ZHK] uses the Chern-Simons Lagrangian in (2 + 1) dimensions,

[formula]

where the scalar field φ is the order parameter and Aμ is the statistical gauge field; Dμ  =  ∂μ - iAμ is the covariant derivative. The constant κ is interpreted as the Hall conductivity. The second-order field equations are not integrable [\cite=LVW]; they admit integrable reductions, though. The simplest of these is when time-dependence is eliminated; then, for a judicious choice of the self-interaction potential V(φ), the system admits finite-energy vortex solutions [\cite=JPD]. Here we focus our attention to another, space-like reduction [\cite=AGJPS]. Assuming independence from one spacelike coordinate and adding a suitable kinetic term yields in fact, after elimination of the gauge field using its equation of motion,

[formula]

where ρ  =  |φ|2 is the particle density. This is the model proposed in Ref. [\cite=BERA] to describe the edge states in the QHE.

The field equations associated to ([\ref=redlag]) read

[formula]

Then the particle density and the current satisfy the continuity equation ∂tρ  +  ∂xj = 0. Let us first assume that V = 0. Now the non-local transformation [\cite=MIPA]

[formula]

takes ([\ref=modeqs]) into the modified non-linear Schrödinger equation in which the density in the non-linearity has been replaced by the current,

[formula]

The variable-coefficient NLS

Decomposing ψ into module and phase, [formula], yields (formally) the ordinary cubic NLS with variable coefficient,

[formula]

with F(t,x) = 2κ2∂xθ. Then Aglietti et al. [\cite=AGJPS] observe that, for θ = vx - ωt, Eq. ([\ref=vnls]) reduces to the usual non-linear Schrödinger equation with constant coefficient F = 2κ2v which admits, for example, the travelling soliton solution

[formula]

The non-linearity in ([\ref=vnls]) has to be attractive, F > 0; the solution ([\ref=trasol]) is therefore chiral, v > 0.

It is natural to ask whether the travelling soliton ([\ref=trasol]) can be generalized. Let us first study the variable-coefficient NLS ([\ref=vnls]) on its own. It has been shown [\cite=JOSHI] that this equation only passes the Painlevé test of Weiss, Tabor and Carnevale [\cite=WTC], when the coefficient of the non-linearity is

[formula]

where a and b constants. For b = 0, F(t,x) is a constant and we recover the constant-coefficient NLS. For [formula], the equation becomes explicitly time-dependent. Assuming, for simplicity, that a = 0 and b = 1, it reads

[formula]

This equation can also be solved. Generalizing the usual travelling soliton, we find, for example, the 1-soliton

[formula]

It is worth pointing out that the steps followed in constructing ([\ref=travwave]) are essentially the same as those for the travelling soliton of the ordinary NLS -- and this is not a pure coincidence. A short calculation shows in fact that

[formula]

satisfies the time-dependent equation ([\ref=tnls]) if and only if Ψ(t,x) solves Eqn. ([\ref=vnls]) with F = 1. Our soliton ([\ref=travwave]) comes in particular from the "standing soliton" [formula] solution of the NLS.

Non-relativistic conformal transformations

Where does the formula ([\ref=travwave]) come from ? The non-linear space-time transformation

[formula]

has already been met in a rather different context, namely in describing planetary motion when the gravitational "constant" changes inversely with time, as suggested by Dirac [\cite=DIR]. One shows in fact that [formula] describes planetary motion with Newton's "constant" varying as G(t) = G0  /  t, whenever [formula] describes ordinary planetary motion, i.e. the one with a constant gravitational constant G0 [\cite=VIN], [\cite=DHP]. The strange-looking transformation ([\ref=dtraf]) is indeed related to the conformal structure of non-relativistic space-time [\cite=JNH]. It has been noticed in fact almost thirty years ago, that the "conformal" space-time transformations

[formula]

implemented on wave functions according to

[formula]

permute the solutions of the free Schrödinger equation. In other words, they are symmetries of the free Schrödinger equation. The generators in ([\ref=o21]) span in fact an [formula] group. (A Dirac monopole, an Aharonov-Bohm vector potential and an inverse-square potential can also be included). The transformation D in Eqn. ([\ref=dtraf]) belongs to this symmetry group: it is in fact (i) a time translation with ε = 1, (ii) followed by an expansion with κ = 1, (iii) followed by a second time-translation with ε = 1. It is hence a symmetry for the free (linear) Schrödinger equation.

The cubic NLS with constant non-linearity is not more [formula] invariant: the transformation D in ([\ref=dtraf]) implemented as in Eq. ([\ref=impl]) carries the cubic term into the time-dependent term (1 / t)|u|2u, just like Newton's gravitational potential G0 / r with G0  =  const. is carried into the time-dependent Dirac expression t- 1G0 / r. More generally, the the non-linear Schrödinger equation with time-dependent coefficients,

[formula]

can be transformed into the constant-coefficient form, whenever

[formula]

This same condition was found later as the one needed for the Painlevé test [\cite=JOSHI].

Similar arguments explain the integrability of other NLS type equations. For example, electromagnetic waves in a non-uniform medium propagate according to

[formula]

which can again be solved by inverse scattering [\cite=CL]. This is explained by observing that the potential term here can be eliminated by switching to a uniformly accelerated frame:

[formula]

Then u(t,x) solves ([\ref=CLLeq]) whenever Ψ(T,X) solves the free equation.

The transformation ([\ref=accelf]) is again related to the structure of non-relativistic space-time. It can be shown in fact [\cite=DHP] that the (linear) Schrödinger equation

[formula]

can be brought into the free form by a space-time transformation if and only if the potential is [formula] For the uniform force field (ω = 0) the required transformation is precisely ([\ref=accelf]).

For the oscillator potential (α = 0), one can use rather Niederer's transformation [\cite=NI]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

so that ψ satisfies the oscillator-equations iff Ψ solves the free equation.

The Niederer transformation ([\ref=ntraf]) leaves the inverse square potential invariant; this explains why the Calogero model in a harmonic background can be brought into the pure Calogero form [\cite=AVJE]. Restoring the nonlinear term allows us to infer also that

[formula]

is integrable, and its solutions are obtained from those of the "free" NLS by the transformation ([\ref=ntraf]). Let us mention that the covariance w. r. t. chronoprojective transformations was used before [\cite=BUPE] for solving the NLS in oscillator and uniform-field backgrounds.

Now the constant-coefficient, damped, driven NLS,

[formula]

passes the Painlevé test if

[formula]

[\cite=CLA], i. e., precisely when the potential can be transformed away by our "non-relativistic conformal transformations".

An integrable extension

Unfortunately, the time-dependent travelling soliton ([\ref=travwave]) is inconsistent with the original equation ([\ref=jnls]), since its phase is quadratic in x rather than linear, as required by consistency. The clue for finding integrable extensions is to observe that Eqn. ([\ref=jnls]) is in fact a Derivative Non-Linear Schrödinger equation (DNLS) [\cite=MIPA]. Now the results of Clarkson and Cosgrove [\cite=CLCO] say that the constant-coefficient equation

[formula]

is integrable iff

[formula]

In our case a =  - b =  - κ2 and c = 0; Eq. ([\ref=jnls]) is therefore not integrable. However, adding a 6th-order potential to the Lagrange density i. e. considering rather

[formula]

converts ([\ref=jnls]) into an integrable equation. Eq. ([\ref=6jnls]) admits, e. g., the travelling wave solution [formula], where

[formula]

This can be checked by observing that for the Ansatz ψ = f(x,t)eivx / 2 the modified NLS ([\ref=6jnls]) again reduces to a constant-coefficient equation. Then the imaginary part of ([\ref=6jnls]) requires that f(x,t) = f(x - (v / 2)t), while the real part can be integrated by the usual trick of multiplication by f'. The asymptotic conditions fix the integration constant to vanish, yielding a six-order non-linear equation, only containing even powers of f. Then, introducing ρ = f2, we end up with the equation

[formula]

whose integration provides us with ([\ref=newsol]).

Another way of understanding how the integrability comes is to apply the non-local transformation ([\ref=nltraf]) backwards, which carries ([\ref=6jnls]) into a Derivative Non-linear Schrödinger equation of type II (DNLSII),

[formula]

which, consistently with Eq. ([\ref=clcocond]), is integrable [\cite=KNCLL].
