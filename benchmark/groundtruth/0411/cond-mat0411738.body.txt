Comment on "A Tale of Two Theories: Quantum Griffiths Effects in Metallic Systems" by A. H. Castro-Neto and B. A. Jones:

In a recent paper[\cite=Neto04] Castro-Neto and Jones argue that because (as previously noted [\cite=Neto00] [\cite=Millis02]) the observability of quantum Griffiths-McCoy effects in metals is controlled by non-universal quantities, the quantum Griffiths-McCoy scenario is a viable explanation for the non-fermi-liquid behavior observed in heavy fermion compounds. Here we show, expanding on results of Ref. [\cite=Millis02], that the "non-universal quantity" is simply the damping of the spin dynamics by the metallic electrons. Quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior is only obtained when the damping is parametrically weak relative to other scales in the problem, in other words when the spins are essentially decoupled from the metallic electrons. This suggests that in heavy fermion materials, where the Kondo effect leads to a strong carrier-spin coupling, quantum Griffiths-McCoy effects are unlikely to occur.

Quantum Griffiths-McCoy divergences arise from quantum mechanical tunneling of disorder-induced spin droplets. For example, the Griffiths-McCoy contribution to the magnetic susceptibility χ(T) may be expressed as

[formula]

Here N is a measure of the droplet size and [formula],

[formula]

are respectively the probability of finding a droplet of size N and the rate at which a typical droplet of size N tunnels.

The essential feature of these equations is the critical droplet size, Nc, above which tunnelling ceases. In an insulator with Ising symmetry one expects Nc  =    ∞  . Quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior with exponent controlled by N(ξ) / ν occurs as a balance between the exponentially decreasing probability of finding a large droplet and the exponentially increasing tunnelling time ω- 1tun. However, in a metallic system, the spin excitations of the particle-hole continuum typically lead to an overdamped spin dynamics and thus to a finite, damping-dependent Nc. Frozen droplets with N > Nc give a superparamagnetic 1 / T contribution to χ, whereas those with N  ≤  Nc may in appropriate circumstances give a contribution to χ which in some temperature regime is approximately a power law divergence with exponent between 0 and 1 and which is larger than the superparamagnetic contribution.

Eqs. ([\ref=chi]), ([\ref=tunn]) and much of the physical picture were given in Ref. [\cite=Neto00]; similar results were derived from a different starting point in Ref. [\cite=Millis02]. Ref. [\cite=Neto04] presents a detailed correspondence between the two approaches, expanding on the comparison noted in Ref. [\cite=Millis02]. The key points, not discussed in [\cite=Neto00] [\cite=Neto04] are that the 'appropriate circumstances' in which quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior may occur are that Nc is large enough that almost all relevant droplets can tunnel, that the distribution of tunnelling rates is appropriately broad and is nearly continuous. We show that this requires that the damping is very weak relative to the other scales in the problem [\cite=note2].

A spin system embedded in a metal has, at sufficiently long times, an overdamped dynamics characterized by a damping coefficient Γ which is expected to be of the order of the other scales in the problem (such as the Fermi energy). We denote these scales generically as E0. The conventions are such that Γ  ≫  E0 corresponds to very weak damping and Γ  ≪  E0 to very strong damping (see Ref. [\cite=Millis02] for details). Eqs.(3) and (4) of Ref. [\cite=Neto04] show that Nc  ≈  Γ / E0; thus only for systems with parametrically small damping can Nc be large enough to allow a quantum Griffiths-McCoy regime. Ref. [\cite=Neto00] obtained a large value for Nc by using an inconsistent procudure: the Γ was calculated for the single impurity Kondo problem (i.e. a 'light electron' value was used) but an E0 calculated for a dense Kondo system. A consistent calculation [\cite=Millis04] for a dense Kondo system leads to Γ / E0  ~  1

An additional constraint having to do with the tunnelling rate distribution arises from a detailed analysis, which shows that for quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior to be observable a certain constant C2 must be much greater than unity (see Eqs.(50) of Ref. [\cite=Millis02] or Eqs.(11) of Ref. [\cite=Neto04]). Ref. [\cite=Neto04] uses an incorrect result for C2. The correct result is (see Eqs.(29)-(34) of Ref. [\cite=Millis02])

[formula]

with ln cd = 0.115 and ξ0 a 'microscopic' length scale expected to be of the order of a lattice constant. Ref. [\cite=Millis02] found [formula] implying that C2≃2.2 is a fixed number of order unity and therefore not a number large enough to yield significant quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior. This estimate of τm was derived on the assumption that the damping scale is comparable to other scales in the problem. If τm is determined by some damping-independent physics and if the damping is parametrically weak (Γ exponentially large) then a large value of C2 could occur. Thus we see again that, as expected, one obtains quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior only if the dissipative contribution to the dynamics becomes unimportant.

To summarize, quantum Griffiths-McCoy behavior may occur in disordered magnets with undamped or very weakly damped spin dynamics, but not in magnets in which the damping is significant. The essential feature of heavy fermion materials is a strong carrier-spin coupling. While it seems very unlikely that in these materials the damping is weak enough to allow quantum Griffiths-McCoy divergences, a final resolution of this issue can only come from experiments. To this end, we will show in a future paper [\cite=Millis04] how nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron scattering measurements may be used to determine the ratio Γ / E0.
