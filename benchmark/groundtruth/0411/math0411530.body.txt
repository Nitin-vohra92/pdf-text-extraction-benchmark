Let (M,d(x,y)) be a metric space. Thus M is a nonempty set and d(x,y) is a nonnegative real-valued function defined for x,y∈M such that d(x,y)  =  0 if and only if x  =  y, d(y,x)  =  d(x,y) for all x,y∈M, and

[formula]

for all x,y,z∈M. If

[formula]

for all x,y,z∈M, then we say that d(x,y) defines an ultrametric on M.

A real-valued function f(x) on M is said to be Lipschitz of order α for some positive real number α if there is a nonnegative real number C such that

[formula]

for all x,y∈M, which is equivalent to

[formula]

for all x,y∈M. Notice that this holds with C  =  0 if and only if f is constant on M.

If p∈M and f(x)  =  d(x,p), then f is Lipschitz of order 1 with C  =  1 by the triangle inequality. More generally, if A is a nonempty subset of M, then

[formula]

is Lipschitz of order 1 with C  =  1.

Every Lipschitz function on the real line of order α  >  1 is constant. One way to see this is to observe that such a function is differentiable at every point with derivative equal to 0. More generally, every Lipschitz function on [formula] of order strictly larger than 1 is constant.

If a, b are nonnegative real numbers and q is a positive real number, then

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

when r  >  q. In particular, if 0  <  q  ≤  1, then

[formula]

Let (M,d(x,y)) be a metric space and let q be a positive real number with q  ≤  1. One can check that d(x,y)q is also a metric on M.

Now suppose that d(x,y) is an ultrametric on M and that q is any positive real number. One can check d(x,y)q is an ultrametric on M too. In both situations the topology on M determined by d(x,y)q is the same as the one determined by d(x,y).

Suppose that (M,d(x,y)) is a metric space and that

[formula]

for some metric ρ(x,y) on M and some a  >  0. A real-valued function f(x) on M is Lipschitz of order α  >  0 on M with constant C with respect to the metric d(x,y) if and only if f(x) is Lipschitz of order a  α on M with constant C with respect to ρ(x,y).

If a  >  1, then it follows that there are plenty of Lipschitz functions on M of order a with respect to d(x,y), since there are plenty of Lipschitz functions of order 1 on M with respect to ρ(x,y). For example, these functions separate points on M, which is to say that for any pair of distinct points in M there is such a function which takes different values at the two points.

As a special case, consider the real line [formula] with the metric |x  -  y|a for some a∈(0,1). A Lipschitz function on [formula] of order 1 with respect to the standard metric |x  -  y| is Lipschitz of order 1 / a  >  1 with respect to |x  -  y|a. For each positive integer n we can consider [formula] with the metric |x  -  y|a, where |x  -  y| is the standard metric, and every Lipschitz function on [formula] of order 1 with respect to the standard metric is a Lipschitz function of order 1 / a with respect to |x  -  y|a.

Now consider [formula] where the distance between x  =  (x1,x2) and y  =  (y1,y2) is defined to be

[formula]

One can check that this defines a metric on [formula] which is compatible with the standard topology.

This kind of space was considered by my colleague Frank Jones in connection with the heat equation and related singular integral operators. It is also an instance of a "Rickman's rug" as discussed in [\cite=Juha3], with very interesting properties concerning quasiconformal mappings and geometry.

As on any metric space, there are plenty of Lipschitz functions on this space of order α  ≤  1. There are nonconstant Lipschitz functions of order α∈(1,2], which are constant in the first variable. Every Lipschitz function on this space of order strictly larger than 2 is constant.

It is convenient to define [formula] for [formula] by

[formula]

so that the distance function on [formula] defined above can be described as [formula]. Notice that

[formula]

for all [formula], and if we define dilations δr on [formula] for r  >  0 by

[formula]

then

[formula]

for all [formula] and r  >  0.

One can check that the measure of a ball of radius t in [formula] with respect to this metric and using standard Lebesgue measure is equal to a positive constant times t3, where the constant is simply the measure of the ball centered at the origin with radius 1. Also, every open ball in [formula] with respect to this metric is homeomorphic to the standard unit disk in [formula].

Let (M,d(x,y)) be a metric space, and let ε, λ be positive real numbers. A finite sequence of points [formula] in M will be called an (ε,λ)-chain if

[formula]

for all i, 0  ≤  i  <  l, and

[formula]

In other words, the size of each step in the chain is less than ε, and the total length of the chain is less than or equal to λ.

Suppose that f(x) is a real-valued function on M which is Lipschitz of order α  >  1 with constant C. If [formula] is an (ε,λ)-chain in M, then we have that

[formula]

On [formula] with the standard metric, each pair of points can be connected by an (ε,λ)-chain where ε  >  0 is arbitrary and λ is equal to the distance between the two points, and this gives another way to see that Lipschitz functions of order strictly larger than 1 must be constant. In the real line there are Cantor sets on which there are plenty of locally constant functions, and hence plenty of functions which are Lipschitz of any positive order, and where the gaps in the Cantor set are small enough so that there are a lot of interesting (ε,λ)-chains with ε small, which lead to significant restrictions on the behavior of Lipschitz functions of order strictly larger than 1.

Let (M1,d1(x,y)) and (M2,d2(u,v)) be metric spaces. A mapping φ:M1  →  M2 is said to be bilipschitz with constant C  ≥  1 if

[formula]

for all x,y∈M1. If there is a bilipschitz mapping of M1 onto M2, then we say that M1 and M2 are bilipschitz equivalent.

Notice that C  =  1 in this condition if and only if φ:M1  →  M2 is an isometry, which is to say that

[formula]

for all x,y∈M1. If there is an isometry of M1 onto M2, then we say that M1, M2 are isometrically equivalent.

Let (M,d(x,y)) be a metric space, and let E be a subset of M. We say that E is porous in M if there is a C  >  0 so that for each x∈M there is a y∈M with d(x,y)  ≤  r and d(y,z)  ≥  C- 1  r for all z∈E.

Clearly a porous set has empty interior. Observe that the closure of a porous set is again porous, and with the same constant C. Thus a porous set is nowhere dense.

Let us take M to be [formula] with the standard metric. It is easy to see that a porous set E has measure 0, and indeed even if one takes the closure of E there are no points of density.

We can strengthen this assertion as follows. If Q is a cube in [formula] and L  ≥  2 is an integer, then we can express Q as the union of Ln cubes with sidelength equal to 1 / L times the sidelength in the usual way, by subdividing the sides of Q into L segments of equal length. A subset E of [formula] is porous if and only if there is an L  ≥  2 such that for each cube Q in [formula] there is a subcube Q1 of Q which is disjoint from E and which is one of the Ln subcubes with sidelength equal to 1 / L times the sidelength of Q just described.

Using this one can check that for each cube Q in [formula] and each positive integer k one can cover [formula] by ≤  (Ln  -  1)k subcubes of Q with sidelength equal to L- k times the sidelength of Q. It follows that the Hausdorff dimension of E is less than or equal to ( log (Ln  -  1))  /  ( log L)  <  n.
