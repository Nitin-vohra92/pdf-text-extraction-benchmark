Hypercubes circumscribed in hyperspheres: a constant growth ratio for volumes at large dimensions

It is well known that the volume of a hypersphere embedded in an euclidean n-dimensional space decreases to zero for large n [\cite=uno] [\cite=dos]. The value of n in which the hypersphere volume starts to decrease depends on the ratio R. On the other hand, the corresponding volume of a unitary hypercube remains constant in an euclidean n-dimensional space. We now consider the problem of the circumscription of hypercubes in hyperspheres in euclidean n-dimensional spaces.

The volume of a hypersphere in n dimensions, for a given ratio R, is given by:

[formula]

If the hypersphere circumscribes an unitary hypercube in the same n dimensional space, then, the hypersphere ratio is given by:

[formula]

So, the volumes Vn + 1 and Vn are related by the equation:

[formula]

Clearly, for large n:

[formula]

Fig. 1 shows, for continuous n, the corresponding plot of Eq.([\ref=three])

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the irrational number [formula] appears in a computation related to n-dimensional geometry. The result shows that the circumscription requirement defines o family of hyperspheres that possess constant volume growth as the number of dimensions of its corresponding space tends to infinity. Further properties of circumscription problems will be studied in future work.
