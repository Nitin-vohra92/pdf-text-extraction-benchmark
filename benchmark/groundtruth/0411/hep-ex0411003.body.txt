CHARMED MESON SPECTROSCOPY

Introduction

These proceedings will discuss new results in the P-wave sector of the c systems, where q is one of u, d or s. The spectroscopy of these mesons is described by coupling of the spins of the quark and anti-quark, Sc and [formula], with the orbital angular momentum, L, between the quark and anti-quark. When L = 1 this coupling produces 4 states, with JP  =  {2+,1+,1+,0+}.

Until recently, all of the measured properties of the P-wave sector were well described by models which exhibit Heavy Quark Symmetry, HQS. In the limit that the mass of the charmed quark is >  > ΛQCD, the spin of the charmed quark decouples from the dynamics, leaving the total angular momentum of the light quark, [formula], as an effective quantum number. In this limit, the cū and c P-wave states are grouped into two doublets. One doublet, with [formula], has members with JP  =  {2+,1+}; these states decay to D( * )π in a D-wave and have natural widths of order 20 MeV. The other doublet, with [formula] has members with JP  =  {1+,0+}; these states decay to D( * )π in an S-wave and have natural widths of order a few hundred MeV. In the following the two JP = 1+ states will be denoted as D1 and [formula], where the first notation is for the state with [formula]. To obtain the properties of the physical states, the finite mass of the charmed quark is introduced as a small perturbation on the HQS states.

The states with [formula] are well established and have the predicted properties. The states with [formula] have only recently been observed and are the topic of these proceedings. A more detailed discussion of HQS and a review of the data up to 10 years ago can be found in reference [\cite=barteltshukla]. The experimental results reviewed in these proceedings are the first significant new results since that time so the reference remains relevant.

P-wave Charmed Non-Strange Mesons

There are two new measurements in this sector. The FOCUS collaboration has presented measurements[\cite=focus] using the traditional method of looking at the inclusive D+π- and D0π+ invariant mass spectra. The second set of new measurements comes from the BELLE collaboration[\cite=belledalitz], who have pioneered a new technique, the measurement of excited charm resonances in the Dalitz plots of the decays B  →  Dππ and B  →  D*ππ.

In the Dπ mass spectra presented by FOCUS one expects contributions from five processes plus combinatoric background. The five processes are: D*2  →  Dπ, feed-down from D*2  →  D*π , feed-down from D1(2420)  →  D*π, D*0  →  Dπ, and feed-down from [formula]. In the feed-down processes, the D*'s decay to a D plus unobserved neutrals, giving a final state of Dπ. Because of the small Q values in these decay chains, the peaks from the feed-down processes suffer little kinematic broadening. In previous inclusive measurements, the first three processes, which give rise to narrow peaks, have been well established, but the final two processes, which produce broad peaks, could not be resolved above the combinatoric background.

Following the earlier experiments, the FOCUS collaboration first tried to fit their Dπ mass spectra without including the last two processes. Their experiment, however, has an order of magnitude higher statistics than previous experiments and, after trying many models of the combinatoric background, none was able to produce a good fit to their data. Inspection of the residuals of the fits suggested that the fit would be improved by introducing a contribution from a broad resonance. Such a contribution was parameterized using S-wave Breit-Wigner with a free mass, width and yield. This contribution is intended to model the sum of the contributions from an unknown mixture of D*0 and feed-down from the [formula]. When this term was added, the fit produced an acceptable χ2. However it was never possible to resolve separately contributions from the D*0 and the [formula].

It has long been anticipated that the e+e- B-factory experiments would open a new window on charm spectroscopy through the analysis of the Dalitz plots in B decay. The first hint at the power of this technique was presented by CLEO[\cite=cleo99], in which they used a partial reconstruction technique to perform a multi-dimensional fit to the decay B-  →  D*  +π-π-.

BELLE has presented the first example of this technique using full reconstruction of the final state. They presented a fit to the Dalitz plot of the decay B-  →  D+π-π- and a 4 dimensional fit to the decay B-  →  D*  +π-π-. A key component of their analysis is that the energy of the B mesons in the e+e- center-of-mass frame is fully determined and they require that the energy of their B candidates be consistent with this energy. This requirement removes the feed-down processes which complicate the FOCUS analysis. Compared with the FOCUS data, the BELLE data has an improved signal to background ratio, at the expense of signal yield.

The power of multi-dimensional fits is that interference among the contributing amplitudes gives rise to structures with distinctive shapes that are readily distinguished from backgrounds. For example the presence of the D* 00 is established by observing its interference with the D*2 in the D+π-π- Dalitz plot. Moreover these interference effects are powerful probes of the JP of the intermediate states and BELLE establishes that the D* 00 and [formula] states do indeed have JP = 0+ and JP = 1+, as expected. In neither fit does BELLE find a significant contribution from a constant amplitude; that is, the data are fully described by a sum of resonant contributions, including virtual processes via the D* and B*.

FOCUS and BELLE also presented new measurements of the parameters of the D*2 mesons. These measurements have errors that are comparable to those of the previous world averages.

All of the masses and widths discussed above, along with the PDG 2002 averages and new world averages, are shown in figure [\ref=fig:nonstrange]. Inspection shows that the new results are consistent with the PDG 2002 values, albeit barely consistent in a few cases. It does seem that the new results do prefer broader widths for both the of the D*2 charge states. Perhaps this indicates of a bias toward narrow widths in early, statistically weaker observations. Because the FOCUS measurements of the [formula] states are for an unknown mixture of the D*0 and feed-down from the [formula], the author recommends that the best values for the properties of the D* 00 are the BELLE results alone.

There are several reasons why the B decay results might differ systematically from the inclusive measurements. The line shape of the resonances is a matrix element squared multiplied by a phase-space factor. In the inclusive measurements it is difficult to write down the phase-space factor and it has always been ignored, motivated by the assumption that it varies only slowly over the region of interest. In B decays it is straightforward to write down the phase space factors and BELLE includes them. Presumably this is a small effect for the narrow states but an important effect for the broad states. A second difference is that the inclusive analyses always assume that the resonances are produced incoherently. While this is likely, is not certain.

The author looks forward to BaBar entering the field with Dalitz analyses of their B decays. He also looks forward to both B-factories presenting updated results with much larger datasets. In the longer term, both BTeV and LHC-b should contribute to charm spectroscopy through the Dalitz analysis of B decays.

P-wave Charmed Strange Mesons

In the charmed strange sector, the D*s2 and the narrow Ds1(2536) have been well established for more than a decade. It was long presumed that the the D*s0 and the [formula] would lie above threshold for decay to DK and D*K. In such a case this sector would look much like the non-strange sector, differing only in detail.

This picture was overthrown when the BaBar collaboration published the surprising observation of a new, narrow resonance at a mass of about 2317 MeV which decays to Dsπ0[\cite=babards1]. Their paper also hinted at a second narrow resonance at a mass near 2456 MeV which decays to D*sπ0. Shortly afterward the first state was confirmed by CLEO[\cite=cleods], who also claimed a definite observation of the second state. Both BaBar and CLEO observed these states in continuum e+e- production. Both states were soon confirmed by BELLE, who observed them both in continuum e+e-[\cite=bellenonb] and in B decay[\cite=belleb]. BELLE observed new decay modes of the Ds(2456), to Dsγ and Dsπ+π-, and a new decay mode of one of the well established states, Ds1(2536)  →  Dsπ+π-. BaBar has since confirmed the Ds(2456)[\cite=babar2]. Finally, FOCUS has observed the state at 2317 MeV in Dsπ0, which represents the first observation of either state outside of the e+e-[\cite=vondo]. In the following these states will be refered to the as the D*s0((2317) and the Ds1(2456).

The analysis of the two states is more subtle than is hinted at by the previous paragraph. Consider the decay chain, Ds1(2456)  →  D*sπ0, D*s  →  Dsγ. If the γ is missed and the state is reconstructed as Dsπ0, it produces a narrow feed-down peak in the Dsπ0 mass spectrum at a mass very close to that of the D*s0(2317). Now consider starting with the decay D*s0(2317)  →  Dsπ0, adding a random photon, requiring that the Dsγ invariant mass fall within the experimental resolution on the D*s mass, and then plotting the Dsγπ0 invariant mass. This feed-up process will produce a narrow peak in the D*sπ0 invariant mass spectrum at a mass close to that of the Ds(2456). A typical mass peak in any of the BaBar, BELLE or CLEO analysis contains about 75% from the signal being looked for and about 25% from either the feed-up or feed-down background. The three experiments have developed different methods for unfolding the true signals from these backgrounds and all experiments get consistent results.

None of the experiments observe a non-zero natural width for these states and the best upper limit comes from BELLE [\cite=bellenonb], Γ(D*s0(2317)) < 4.6 MeV and Γ(Ds1(2456)) < 5.5 MeV, both at the 90% confidence level.

The quantum numbers of these states are already well constrained. The observation of Ds1(2456)  →  Dsγ, forbids J = 0 and the BELLE analysis of angular distributions in the decay B  →  DDs1(2456) prefers J = 1 over J = 2. The decay Ds1(2456)  →  Dsπ0 is not observed, even though phase space favors it over D*sπ0. This is most easily explained if the Ds(2456) has JP from the unnatural sequence, [formula]. So the spin parity assignment of JP = 1+ is strongly preferred for the Ds(2456). Because the Ds(2317) is observed to decay to two pseudo-scalars, and presuming that parity is conserved in its decay, the Ds(2317) must have JP from the natural spin parity sequence, [formula].

Summary and Conclusions

In the cū and c sectors most of the [formula] states have been observed; only the [formula] remains unobserved. These states have the properties predicted by HQS and the JP quantum numbers are established using the multi-dimensional analysis presented by BELLE. The results from the old inclusive technique and the new exclusive technique agree with each other but, in a few cases, the agreement is only marginal. Perhaps this is an indication that small effects, which could be ignored in the past can no longer be ignored in high statistics, high precision experiments. The author looks forward to many years of new results in charm spectroscopy from the multi-dimensional analysis of B decays.

In the cs̄ sector both [formula] states have now been established. The Ds1(2456) has JP = 1+ strongly favored while the D*s0(2317) is known to have JP from the natural sequence, consistent with the expectation of 0+. Although many people considered the low masses of these states a surprise, if you accept the masses then all of the other properties of these states make sense. For example the narrow widths arise because only suppressed decay modes are kinematically allowed.
