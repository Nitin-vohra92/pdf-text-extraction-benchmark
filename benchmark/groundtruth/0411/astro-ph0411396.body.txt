The CRESST dark matter search

Introduction

Despite persuasive indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe and in galaxies, the direct detection of dark matter remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges of present-day physics and cosmology. The Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) is a well motivated candidate for cold dark matter in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particle. It is possible that it can be detected by laboratory experiments, particularly using cryogenic methods, which are well adapted to the small energy deposit expected[\cite=Goodman].

The CRESST experiment

In the CRESST experiment we attempt to detect WIMP-nucleus scattering using cryogenic methods. Results from the first phase of CRESST using sapphire detectors have been reported previously[\cite=CRESST-I]. For CRESST II[\cite=proposal] we have developed cryogenic detectors based on scintillating CaWO4 crystals. When further equipped with a light detector these provide very efficient discrimination of nuclear recoils from radioactive γ and β backgrounds, down to recoil energies of about 10 ~ keV. The mass of each crystal is about 300 g. Passive background suppression is achieved with a low background installation and the deep underground location at the Gran Sasso laboratory. The overburden of 3500 meter water equivalent reduces the surface muon flux to about 1 / (m2h). The detectors themselves are shielded against ambient radioactivity by low background copper and lead. A neutron shield and a muon veto, to be installed for CRESST-II, were not present for the data presented here. A four channel SQUID system allowed the simultaneous operation of only two phonon/light modules.

Detectors

A single detector module consists of a scintillating CaWO4 crystal, operated as a cryogenic calorimeter (the "phonon channel"), and a nearby but separate cryogenic detector optimized for the detection of scintillation photons (the "light channel"). The phonon channel is designed to measure the energy transfer to a nucleus of the CaWO4 crystal in a WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering. Since a recoil-nucleus differs substantially in the yield of scintillation light from an electron or a γ-quanta of the same energy, an effective background discrimination against γ-particles and electrons is obtained by a simultaneous measurement of the phonon and light signals. The prototype detector modules used here consist of a 300 g cylindrical CaWO4 crystal with 40 mm diameter and height, and an associated cryogenic light detector[\cite=Meunier] [\cite=LTD10]. The light detector is mounted close to a flat surface of the CaWO4 crystal, and both detectors are enclosed by a housing made of a highly reflective polymeric multilayer foil. The arrangement is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:detector_scheme]. The detectors are operated at a temperature of about 10  mK where the tungsten thermometer is in its transition between the superconducting and the normal conducting state, so that a small temperature rise of the thermometer leads to a relatively large rise of its resistance which is measured by means of a two-armed parallel circuit. One branch of the circuit has the superconducting film and the other comprises a reference resistor in series with the input coil of a SQUID, which provides a sensitive measurement of current changes. A rise in the thermometer resistance and so an increase in current through the SQUID coil is then observed as a rise in SQUID output voltage. Incoming pulses are recorded using a 16-bit transient recorder. For a more detailed description of the experimental setup see[\cite=astro_limit].

Temperature stability and energy calibration

To monitor the long term stability of the thermometers particle-event like heater test pulses with a range of discrete energies in the energy region of interest were sent every 30  s throughout both dark matter and calibration runs. The response to these proved to be stable within the energy resolution of the detectors. The accuracy of the energy calibration from 10 to 40 ~ keV, as relevant for the WIMP search is in the range of a few percent. This can be inferred from a peak at 47.1 ~ keV which appeared in the energy spectrum of the phonon channel with a rate of (3.2 ±   0.5) counts / day. We associate this peak with an external 210Pb contamination resulting in a γ-line at 46.5 ~ keV. The FWHM of the measured peak is 1.0 ~ keV, identical with that for the heater pulses. This good resolution confirms the stability of the response during the dark matter run.

Results and discussion

The results shown here were obtained in measurements taken between January 31 and March 23, 2004. The total exposures after all cuts are 9.809 ~ kg ~ d and 10.724 ~ kg ~ d for the two modules. The low-energy data from the dark matter run is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig-ratio_12_34] as a scatter plot. The determination of a nuclear recoil acceptance region in the phonon-light plane is based on a knowledge of the "quenching factor", i.e. the reduction of the light output of a nuclear recoil event relative to an electron/photon event of the same energy. From earlier measurements of recoil neutrons a quenching factor of Q=7.4 was determined[\cite=Meunier]. From this and the light detector resolution the 90 % acceptance band for nuclear recoils is calculated, which is shown in the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig-ratio_12_34] as the area below the upper dashed lines. If we attribute all 16 events from the two detector modules in the acceptance region (corresponding to a count rate of R = (0.87  ±  0.22) / (kg  day)  ) to WIMP interactions, we can set a conservative upper limit for the WIMP scattering cross section shown as the full line in Fig. [\ref=fig-ratio_12_34]. For details on the assumptions made see Ref.[\cite=astro_limit]. Monte Carlo simulations for our setup without neutron shield yield an estimate for the neutron background of about 0.6 ~ events / (kg ~ day) for 12 ~ keV  ≤  Erecoil  ≤  40 ~ keV, in reasonable agreement with the observed rate[\cite=Hesti].

Kinematic considerations and simulations show that the contribution to the neutron spectrum is dominated by recoil of oxygen nuclei within the CaWO4 crystal[\cite=Hesti]. Hence the measured quenching factor will be mostly due to oxygen recoils. However, if one assumes coherent scattering of WIMPs by the nucleus, the interaction cross section will be proportional to A2. Thus WIMPs are mainly expected to interact with tungsten nuclei. In a seperate measurement the quenching factor of tungsten has been determined to be between QW  ≥  40 [\cite=jelena] for 18 ~ keV and 36 ~ keV tungsten energies, thus WIMP interactions are expected to lie in a seperate band below the one determined from neutron recoils. The discrimination efficiency of the two bands will strongly depend on the energy resolution of the attributed light detector. In Fig. [\ref=fig-ratio_12_34] the 90 % acceptance regions for recoil by tungsten are indicated by the area below the solid lines. Since we know that the light detector of one of the two modules did have a slightly deteriorated resolution we discard these data for the extraction of the WIMP coherent cross-section limit. For the better of the two modules there are no recoil events below the full line in the energy range from 12 to 40 ~ keV. Using these data to set a limit we obtain the thick dashed line in the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig-ratio_12_34]. As a check we lowered the threshold to 10 ~ keV to include the two events at 10.5 ~ keV and 11.3 ~ keV below the tungsten line and obtained essentially the same curve. At a WIMP mass of 60 ~ GeV / c2, these tungsten limits, which were obtained without any neutron shielding, are identical to the limits set by EDELWEISS [\cite=Edelweiss]. Very recent results from CDMS at the Soudan Underground Laboratory [\cite=CDMS] have improved these limits by a further factor of four.

Outlook: Upgrade with neutron shield and a 66-channel SQUID readout system

The limits presented in section [\ref=sec:results] were obtained using measurements that were taken without a neutron shield. Thus the sensitivity of these data is limited by the neutron background as well as by the limited exposure. Presently the CRESST setup is being upgraded with a 66-channel SQUID readout system[\cite=squids]. This will allow the installation of 33 detector modules providing 10 ~ kg of target material. Together with the neutron shield that has been installed in October 2004 and the muon veto that is presently under construction this shoud improve CRESST's sensitivity to WIMP dark matter interactions by two orders of magnitude. Fig. [\ref=fig:squids] shows the first 24 SQUIDs that were installed onto the cryostat insert and cooled down to liquid helium temperature at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory. All the tested SQUIDs performed well at liquid helium temperature. The upgrade of the experiment will be completed in early 2005.
