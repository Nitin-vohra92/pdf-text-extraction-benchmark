Voltage-controlled coded qubit based on electron spin

Considerable experimental and theoretical effort is currently being applied towards the realisation of scalable quantum bits and gates. [\cite=feynman] [\cite=bennett] [\cite=nielsen] [\cite=vandersypen] [\cite=bayer] Electron spin-based qubits are considered to be viable candidates due to demonstrated long coherence times [\cite=awschalom] [\cite=fujisawa] [\cite=hanson]. For single quantum dots [\cite=hanson] [\cite=tarucha] [\cite=ciorgaprb] it is now possible to isolate, control, and exploit the spin properties of electron at the single-spin level [\cite=ciorgaprb] [\cite=pioro]. Simultaneously, progress has been made in coupled quantum dot systems, where control of electron numbers in individual dots and coupling between the dots necessary to realise the building blocks for quantum information processing [\cite=pioro] [\cite=livermore] [\cite=oosterkamp] [\cite=duncan] [\cite=holleitner] [\cite=craig] has been demonstrated. Despite this progress many obstacles need to be overcome before elementary quantum operations on electron spin-based qubits[\cite=brum] [\cite=loss] [\cite=ciorga] [\cite=kane] can be demonstrated. One of the fundamental challenges is the task of isolating a single-electron spin and contacting it to perform single-qubit operations. This challenge stems from the need to produce a localised and switchable magnetic field required for spin manipulation. A number of solutions have been proposed [\cite=kato] [\cite=rashba] [\cite=xiao] [\cite=elzerman] to replace the local magnetic field by locally engineered coupling (g-factor) to the constant magnetic field. The g-factor engineering has to be combined with equally challenging spatial manipulation of electron position using surface gates. To date, even single-qubit operation of qubits based on electron spin still awaits demonstration. An alternative solution to the problem of qubit operations on a single spin was proposed by DiVincenzo, Lidar and collaborators [\cite=divincenzo] [\cite=mizel] [\cite=bacon], who suggested quantum computation with exchange interaction. The basic idea is to replace the two-level system based on the single-electron spin with selected levels of a composite object consisting of several spins. The manipulation of selected quantum levels proceeds not through operations on single spins but through manipulation of the coupling J between neighbouring spins due to exchange interaction. For example, two qubit states |0〉 and |1〉 for a single total spin S = 1 / 2 can be identified with two opposite spin directions (Sz) up and down: [formula] and [formula] . By contrast, in a coded qubit consisting of three localised electron spins (a, b, c) we start by selecting a total spin Sz of the three spins, e.g., [formula]. A state with this direction can be realised by three different states: [formula], [formula], and [formula], which differ by the position of the spin pointing up. We can group these three states into a single state with total spin S = 3 / 2 and two orthogonal states with total spin S = 1 / 2. Examples of the two orthogonal spin states forming the two logical qubit states |0L〉 and |1L〉 are [formula] and [formula]).

The properties of a three-electron complex in a single quantum dot, including the two logical spin states discussed above, have been analyzed previously[\cite=hawrylak] [\cite=ashoori]. The three-electron states are a product of the orbital and spin part. The spin part has been discussed in terms of the logical qubit states. But it is precisely the orbital part, and specifically the one electron wavefunction, that can be manipulated using voltages, and hence it plays a crucial role in a coded qubit. In what follows we employ the methodology which allowed for a quantitative understanding of a single dot with controlled number of electrons [\cite=kyriakidis] to study the energy levels and spin and orbital wave functions of a realistic coded qubit. We show that there exist two low-energy states which map very well onto the two logical qubit states, and that they can be manipulated by applied voltages.

The proposed device is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1]a. It consists of a metallic gate defining three coupled lateral quantum dots. The dots are defined by locally depleting the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at a distance D below the surface. Application of a negative voltage creates a broad region depleted of electrons, with three identical minima. An additional gate (the control gate Vx), shown in red, is positioned in-between the two adjacent dots 1 and 2. The gate Vx lowers or increases the tunnelling barrier between the two dots. As we will show, the effect of the gate is identical to the effect of the σx operation acting on logical qubit states. The σx acting on logical qubit |0L〉 transforms it into qubit |1L〉 and vice versa. The manifestation of the σx operation is the energy splitting Δx of the two degenerate logical qubit states. In order to have complete logical qubit rotation we need a second gate. This gate, labelled Vz, plays the role of σz spin operation, and in our model it tunes the potential minimum of the third dot. Finally, we need to precisely control the number of electrons N = 3 in our device. This can be accomplished by following the detailed design which allowed to control the number of electrons in single and coupled quantum dots [\cite=ciorgaprb] [\cite=pioro].

The operation of gates translates into the changes of a potential seen by each of the three electrons in a coded qubit. The electrostatic potential [formula] in the electronic plane due to the gates on the surface is given by an integral over the potential [formula] applied to the gates as [\cite=kyriakidis] [\cite=davies]

[formula]

where D is the distance between the surface and the 2DEG layer, and [formula] is the electrical potential on the surface, corresponding to the appropriate voltage on the gates, and equal to zero in the openings (the holes). In our calculation, we express all energies and distances in the units of effective Rydberg, R  =  m*e4 / 2ε22, and effective Bohr radius, aB  =  ε2  /  m*e2, respectively. Here, e and m* are the electronic charge and effective mass, respectively, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, and [formula] is the Dirac's constant. For GaAs these units are 1R  =  5.93 meV, and 1aB  =  97.9 Å ~   10 nm. The candidate for a coded qubit investigated here has the length of the side of the rectangular gate of 22.4 aB (for better visibility of the potential minima, in Fig. [\ref=fig1] we only show a central part of the gate, with side length of 14 aB). The diameter of the opening (the hole) in the gate is taken to be 4.2 aB, the distance between the centers of each pair of holes is 4.85 aB, and the distance between the gate and the 2DEG layers is 14 aB. The voltage applied to the main gate corresponds to the electronic potential energy - eV = 10 R in the plane of the gates. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1], the pattern of the holes in the surface gate translates into three potential minima on the electronic plane. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1]a, if the voltage of the control gate Vx is set to zero, the three potential minima are identical. But if we apply voltage - eV =  - 10 R, i.e., opposite to that of the main gate, the barrier between two of the dots is lowered and the dots 1 and 2 are strongly coupled. Note that the two other tunnelling barriers are weakly affected by the control gate. The voltage applied to the gates couples to the charge of the electron and determines the potential VE acting on each individual electron. The potential determines the single-electron energies En and wave functions φn(x,y). The external voltages applied to control gates affect directly only single-electron properties, and through the modification of single-electron energies and wave functions - the states of the three-electron complex. To calculate the single-electron spectrum we discretize the area under the gates, and define the single-electron states φn(x,y) on a lattice (xi,yj) with spacing h. Electrons move on a lattice, and their spectrum is described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian:

[formula]

where the site energy and hopping matrix elements are given by Ei,j  =  4h- 2 and [formula], respectively. As a result we obtain a large, but sparse Hamiltonian matrix, which is diagonalized using the conjugate gradient method. In Fig. [\ref=fig2]a we show the calculated energies En corresponding to nine lowest single-particle states as a function of the potential Vx of the control gate. At zero bias the spectrum consists of three energy levels, the ground state and two degenerate excited states, separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum. The corresponding three lowest single-particle wave functions at zero bias are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2]b. The states and the energy spectrum can be understood by considering a linear combination of wave functions fm(x,y) localized on m-th dot. The corresponding ground state can be written as [formula], and the two degenerate excited states as [formula] and [formula]. In all of these states the electron is delocalised and shared between all dots. For negative gate voltages, i.e., when the barrier between the two dots is lowered, the two excited states mix and energy levels split. When the voltage is zero, the three dots are identical, and the two excited states are degenerate. As the barrier between the two dots is increased even further (positive gate voltages), the energies of degenerate states are split again. In this case, however, the splitting is not large. We attribute it to the fact that, in this regime, all interdot barriers are already high and the three dots are almost isolated. Therefore, a further increase of the control gate voltage increases the total energy of the system, but does not lead to a significant symmetry breaking. Now that we understand the effect of gate voltages on a single electron, we proceed to consider three electrons localized in our three-dot potential. We describe simultaneously the spin and orbital three-electron states in the language of second quantization as |iσ,jσ',kσ''〉  =  c+iσc+jσ'c+kσ''|0〉. The operator c+iσ (ciσ) creates (annihilates) an electron with spin σ on the single-particle state φi calculated from Eq. [\ref=eq1]. The electron-electron interactions mix different three-electron configurations for a given set of applied voltages. The mixing is governed by the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, which takes the form:

[formula]

where the energies Eiσ(Vx,Vz) and matrix elements 〈i,j|V|k,l〉(Vx,Vz) of the Coulomb potential are implicit functions of the applied voltages Vx, Vz. These matrix elements are independent of spin. They are calculated in real space as

[formula]

with parameter d accounting for the finite thickness of the electron layer (in the following example we take d  =  0.2 aB). To capture spin effects we generate all possible configurations of three electrons on NS single-particle states and classify them by total spin [\cite=wensauer]. This allows us to construct the Hamiltonian matrix separately in the spin 3 / 2 and spin 1 / 2 basis and diagonalize these matrices numerically. Figure [\ref=fig3] shows the low-energy segment of the three-electron energy spectrum as a function of the voltage on the control gate Vx (the energies are measured from the ground-state energy). The low-energy spectrum consists of two low-energy states corresponding to the two states of the S = 1 / 2 Hilbert space (black lines), while the energy of the higher state corresponds to the high-spin S = 3 / 2 state (red line). The fact that the two S = 1 / 2 logical qubit states are the lowest energy states is important as it facilitates the intialization of a qubit. It is also a rather counterintuitive result as one might expect exchange to favor spin polarized state. A detailed analysis of the correlations in a coded qubit and analogies with Hubbard model will be presented elsewhere. The central result of this paper rests on the identification of the two lowest energy S = 1 / 2 states of a three electron complex as the two logical states of the coded qubit. The two logical states can be manipulated by applying gate voltage Vx, which shifts the energy of the two levels, as seen in Figure [\ref=fig3]. The voltage Vx acts analogously to the σx operation, while the σz operation can be implemented by applying voltage Vz.

The remaining concern is that the two logical qubit states be well isolated from other states with the same total spin. The inset in Fig. [\ref=fig3] shows the energy spectrum over larger energy scale, with a significant gap in the energy spectrum between the two logical qubit states and the remaining S = 1 / 2 states.

In summary, we show that realistic calculations of a lateral gated quantum dot device produce a voltage-tuneable qubit based on electron spin. The device should be able to combine long coherence time inherent to spin with ease of operation inherent to electrical means. While the understanding of real-time operation of the qubit, its coupling to environment, and design of complex qubit circuits remains to be investiagted, it appears that coded qubits based on electron spin are promising devices for quantum information processing.
