The theory of QCD is very remarkable. It is a theory of very few parameters, i. e. only Λc and the quark masses. The latter are related to inputs by the flavor interactions and have nothing to do with the strong interactions. The parameter Λc just sets the scale of the strong interactions and is not a real parameter for the strong interaction itself. Thus the QCD-theory, proposed by Gell-Mann and myself in 1972 [\cite=FritGell], is indeed an exceptional theory, describing lots of complexities in terms of very few parameters, which, as discussed below, might even depend on time.

Usually in physics, especially in particle physics, we deal with the local laws of nature, say the field equations of QCD or the Maxwell equations. But when it comes to the fundamental constants, like the finestructure constant α, we must keep in mind that also questions about the boundary conditions of the universe come up. We do not know, where these constants, like α or αs or the lepton and quark masses, come from, but it could well be that at least a few of them are products of the Big Bang. If the Bing Bang would be repeated, these constants could easily take different values. But in this case it is clear that the constants could never be calculated.

So in connection to the fundamental constants the question comes up, whether they are really cosmic accidents, or whether they are determined by the dynamics, whether they are changing in time or in space, or whether they are indeed calculable in a hypothetical theory going far above the present Standard Model. Also considerations related to the Anthropic Principle should be made. Life in our universe can exist only if the values of the fundamental constants take on certain values. In a universe in which, for example, the u-quark is heavier than the d-quark, the proton would decay in a neutron, and life would not exist, at least not in a form known to us.

Of course, today α is just the interaction constant, describing e. g. electron-scattering at low energies:

[formula]

But it is remarkable. Based on this number, one can calculate all effects in QED to an accuracy of about 1 : 10.000.000, e. g. the magnetic moment of the electron. Of course, QED is only a part of the Standard Model of today, based on a superposition of QCD and the SU(2)  ×  U(1) - electroweak theory, and α is just one of at least 18 parameters, entering the Standard Model.

One of the fundamental quantities is the proton mass. I should like to stress that the proton mass is a rather complicated object in the Standard Model. The coupling constant of QCD follows in leading order the equation:

[formula]

Here the scale parameter Λ enters, which has been determined to be:

[formula]

Λ is a free parameter of QCD, and all numbers of QCD scale with Λ, at least in the limit where the masses of the quarks are set to zero. But Λ can be expressed in terms of MeV, i. e. it is given in reference to the electron mass, which is outside QCD. The physical parameters like the proton mass are simply proportional to Λ, apart from a small correction due to quark masses. The scale of confinement of the quarks is inversely proportional to Λ.

I should also remind you that Grand Unification imposes that the parameters αs, α and αw are not independent. They are related to each other, and related to the unified coupling constant, describing the interaction at the unification scale Λun.

It is known that the group SU(5) does not describe the observations, since the three coupling constants do not converge precisely. If supersymmetric particles are added at an energy scale of about 1 TeV, a convergence takes place, however [\cite=Amaldi]. In SO(10), proposed by P. Minkowski and me [\cite=Fritzsch] the situation is different, since in this group the unification is a two-step process, where another mass scale, the mass scale for the righthanded W-boson, enters. If this mass scale is chosen in the right way, the unification can be achieved without supersymmetry.

After these preparations let me come to the question of time dependence. A group of physicists has recently published their evidence that the finestructure constant had a different value billions of years ago [\cite=Webb]. They were investigating the light from about 134 quasars, using the so-called "many multiplet method". They were looking at the fine-structure of atomic lines, originating from elements like Fe, Ni, Mg, Sn, Ag etc.   .

One particular aspect is that the fine-structure is a rather complex phenomenon, fluctuating in particular also in the sign of the effect. These sign changes have been observed and used in fixing the experimental values of α. The result is:

[formula]

Thus α was slightly larger in the past. If one takes a linear approximation and uses a cosmic lifetime of 14 billion years, the effect is [formula] per year.

If α depends on time, the question arises, how this time-variation is generated. Since α  =  e2  /  , a time variation could come from a time variation of [formula] or c. Both cases are, I think, not very likely. If c depends on time, it would mean, that we have a serious problem with relativity. If [formula] would depend on time, atomic physics runs into a problem. So I think that a time dependence of α simply means that e is becoming time-dependent.

Let me also mention that according to the results of Dyson and Damour [\cite=Damour1] there is a rather strong constraint on a time-variation of α, derived from the investigation of the remains of the Oklo reactor in Gabon. If no other parameters change as well, the relative change [formula] per year cannot be more than 10- 17, i. e. there is a problem with the astrophysical measurements, unless the rate of change for α has become less during the last 2 billion years. The constraint is derived by looking at the position of a nuclear resonance in Samarium, which cannot have changed much during the last 2 billion years. However, I tend not to take this constraint very seriously. According to the Grand Unification αs and Λ should have changed as well, and the two effects (change of α and of Λ) might partially cancel each other.

The idea of Grand Unification implies that the gauge group SU(3) of the strong interactions and the gauge group SU(2)  ×  U(1) of the electroweak sector are subgroups of a simple group, which causes the unification.

Both the groups SU(5) and SO(10) are considered in this way. I like to emphasize that the group SO(10) has the nice property that all leptons and quarks of one generation are described by one representation, the 16-representation. It includes a righthanded neutrino, which does not contribute to the normal weak interaction, but it is essential for the appearance of a mass of the neutrino, which is expected in the SO(10)-Theory.

In SU(5) two representations of the group are needed to describe the leptons and quarks of one generation, a 10- and a ()-representation.

I should also like to emphasize that the gauge couplings αs,αw and α meet in the SU(5)-theory only, if one assumes that above about 1 TeV supersymmetry is realized. In the SO(10)-theory this is not needed. A convergence of the coupling constants can be achieved, since at high energies another energy scale enters, which has to be chosen in a suitable manner.

A change in time of α can be obtained in two different ways. Either the coupling constant αun stays invariant or the unification scale changes. I consider both effects in the SU(5)-model with supersymmetry. In this model the relative changes are related:

[formula]

One may consider the following scenarios:

ΛG invariant, αu  =  αu(t). This is the case considered in [\cite=Calmet] (see also [\cite=Lang]), and one finds

[formula]

and

[formula]

αu invariant, ΛG  =  ΛG(t). One finds

[formula]

[formula]

αu  =  αu(t) and ΛG  =  ΛG(t). One finds

[formula]

where theoretical uncertainties in the factor [formula] have been discussed in [\cite=Calmet]. The actual value of this factor is sensitive to the inclusion of the quark masses and the associated thresholds, just like in the determination of Λ. Furthermore higher order terms in the QCD evolution of αs will play a role. In ref. [\cite=Calmet] it was estimated: R = 38  ±  6.

According to {[\cite=Calmet] the relative changes of Λ and α are opposite in sign. While α is increasing with a rate of 1.0  ×  10- 15  /  yr, Λ and the nucleon mass are decreasing, e.g. with a rate of 1.9  ×  10- 14  /  yr. The magnetic moments of the proton μp as well of nuclei would increase according to

[formula]

The time variation of the ratio Mp / me and α discussed here are such that they could by discovered by precise measurements in quantum optics. The wave length of the light emitted in hyperfine transitions, e.g. the ones used in the cesium clocks being proportional to α4me  /  Λ will vary in time like

[formula]

taking [formula]yr. The wavelength of the light emitted in atomic transitions varies like α- 2:

[formula]

One has [formula]yr. A comparison gives:

[formula]

At present the time unit second is defined as the duration of 6.192.631.770 cycles of microwave light emitted or absorbed by the hyperfine transmission of cesium-133 atoms. If Λ indeed changes, as described above, it would imply that the time flow measured by the cesium clocks does not fully correspond with the time flow defined by atomic transitions.

Recently a high precision experiment was done at the MPQ in Munich, using the precise cesium clock PHARAO from Paris [\cite=haensch].

In this experiment the drift between the year 1999 and 2003 could be measured since in 1999 a similar experiment has been done accidentally. Today the frequency of the 1S-2S-transition is measured to 2466 061 413 187 127 Hz, with an uncertainty of 18 Hz. The drift during the past 43 months is given by 24 Hz, uncertainty about 50 Hz. This implies a change of -0.9 (2.9) 10- 15 per year.

Thus it is found that the prediction of about 2  ×  10- 14 per year is presumably not realized. But further tests are going on.

Nevertheless we have to think what might be the reason that no change seems to be there on the level of 10- 14. Of course, there is the possibility that the astrophysics result is wrong. Further tests to check this are being prepared. But is could also be that a cancellation takes place. The time change [formula] receives 2 contributions, one by [formula], but also one by [formula]. If both are present, one could have a suppression such that e. g. [formula] is not [formula], but only [formula]. This would imply that in the experiment of Haensch et al. the effect is there at the level of few ×  10- 15 / year.

Tests to look for such an effect are being prepared. But it will take at least one year, before results are known. It might also be that the astrophysics observations are wrong. Recently new observations were published, indicating a null-effect [\cite=Quart].
