Black Holes in Brans-Dicke Theory with a Cosmological Constant

Introduction

In 1915, Einstein constructed the relativistic theory of gravity, i.e. general relativity. General relativity is extremely successful at describing the dynamics of our solar system and perhaps the observable Universe. However, general relativity probably does not describe gravity accurately at all scales. Two kinds of problems coming from two different ways, namely that, the singularity problem at small scales and the dark energy problem at large scales, may account for this point explicitly. Since general relativity is also a classical theory, it is natural that it will face the singularity problem. As regards dark energy, Lovelock showed us long ago that it was an entirely natural part of general relativity, namely, the cosmological constant term being the dark energy. However, if we take the cosmological constant term as the dark energy, we will face two even harder problems, the well-known cosmological problem and the correspondence problem. It is widely believed that these problems may be overcome in the quantum gravity. On the other hand, general relativity does not accommodate either Mach's principle or Dirac's large-number hypothesis. Herein, various alternatives of gravity have been explored. As the simplest modification of general relativity, Brans and Dicke developed another relativistic theory of gravity, namely that, the notable Brans-Dicke theory [\cite=1]. Compared to Einstein's general relativity, Brans-Dicke theory describes the gravitation in terms of the metric as well as a scalar field and accommodates both Mach's principle and Dirac's large-number hypothesis as its new ingredients. Furthermore, Brans-Dicke theory also passed all the available observational and experimental tests [\cite=2]. Unfortunately, the singularity problem remains in this theory. Since the gravitational collapse and the subsequent black hole formation is of great importance in classical gravity, many authors have investigated these aspects in Brans-Dicke theory [\cite=3]. Hawking has proved that in four dimensions, the stationary and vacuum Brans-Dicke solution is just the Kerr solution with constant scalar field everywhere [\cite=4]. Cai and Myung have proved that in four dimensions, the charged black hole solution in the Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory is just the Reissner-Nordstr[formula]m solution with a constant scalar field [\cite=5]. Since one had no knowledge of the cosmological constant term in the Brans-Dicke theory, one had not obtained the solution of black holes with the cosmological constant. Thus the goal of this paper is to report we have found the explicit expression of the cosmological term and the solution of de Sitter version for black holes in Brans-Dicke theory.

black holes in four dimensions

We start from the actions of dilaton gravity theory and the Brans-Dicke theory in four dimensions which are given by

[formula]

where R, are the scalar curvature, F2,2 are the usual Maxwell contribution, α is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the Maxwell field, and [formula] is the potential of dilaton which is with respect to the cosmological constant given by [\cite=6]

[formula]

Here λ is the Einstein's cosmological constant. When α = 0 or φ = 0, the potential reduces to the usual Einstein cosmological constant. As for the scalar potential V(φ), we have no knowledge about it. In the next, we would derive this potential by performing a conformal transformation. Varying the actions with respect to the scalar fields, respectively, yields

[formula]

Using equations (3), if we perform a conformal transformation with

[formula]

and demand

[formula]

we get the following relations

[formula]

where f0 and φ0 are two integration constants. The resulting action of Brans-Dicke theory is

[formula]

where Λ is an integration constant and ω = 2f20  -  3  /  2. The cosmology with the potential V(φ) = 2λφ2 have been discussed by Santos and Gregory [\cite=7]. Torres have investigated the cosmology with even more general potential V = φn [\cite=8]. Here we have derived it theoretically. We see that when α = 0, the dilaton gravity theory reduces to the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory and the physical black hole solution is just the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter solution with a constant scalar field [formula]. On the other hand, Eq.(6) indicates that φ is also a constant. Thus we see that the physical black hole solution in Brans-Dicke theory in four dimensions is still the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter one. In this aspect, Hawking has proved that in the four dimensional vacuum Brans-Dicke theory, the black hole solution is just the Kerr solution with a constant scalar field. Cai and Myung have proved that in four dimensions, the charged black hole solution in the Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory is just the Reissner-Nordstr[formula]m solution with a constant scalar field. Thus our conclusion is an extension of their results. We note that the constant Λ is not present in the solution. Thus the term 2λφ2 in Eq.(7) corresponds to the Einstein cosmological constant. It is a remarkably simple expression.

black holes in higher dimensions

The higher dimensional analogue of the actions for the dilaton gravity theory and the Brans-Dicke theory are

[formula]

where [\cite=9]

[formula]

Varying the actions with respect to the scalar fields, respectively, yields

[formula]

Using equations (10), if we perform a conformal transformation with

[formula]

and demand

[formula]

we get the following relations

[formula]

where φ0 is an integration constant. The resulting action of Brans-Dicke theory is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Λ is an integration constant. For simplicity in writing, the potential is expressed as the function of [formula]. At first glance, it is very complicated. In fact, the potential consists of simply four monomials of the scalar field φ. The higher dimensional non-rotating dilaton black hole solution (μν,,μν) with the cosmological constant has been constructed by us [\cite=9]. By applying the conformal transformation in Eq.(11) and Eq.(13), we are easy to write out the higher dimensional one with the cosmological constant in Brans-Dicke theory. In general, the resulting metric is not identical to the Reissner-Nordstr[formula]m-de Sitter solution. In four dimensions, since the scalar field is constant everywhere, if a massive body collapses behind an event horizon, its effect as a source of the scalar field decreases to zero. So Hawking concluded that there will not be any scalar gravitational radiation emitted when two black holes collide in the four dimensional Brans-Dicke theory. In higher dimensions, the scalar field is not constant everywhere, so scalar gravitational radiation will occur when black holes collide. We note again that Λ does not present in the black hole solution. Thus the Λ term in the potential exerts no influences on the properties of the black hole. However, recalling the discussions of Santos and Gregory, and Torres, we conclude that the Λ term makes great contributions to the evolution of the Universe. Here the λ term in the potential is the counterpart of the Einstein cosmological constant.

black holes in Brans-Dicke-Ni theory

In section I, we find that if and only if the coupling α = 0, the dilaton gravity theory reduces to the Brans-Dicke theory via conformal transformation. In this section, we show that when α  ≠  0, the dilaton gravity theory reduces to the Brans-Dicke-Ni theory via conformal transformation. The action of the four dimensional Brans-Dicke-Ni theory is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Lagrangian density found by Ni [\cite=10]. In general, f is a scalar function of other fields which includes scalar, vector and any other fields in the theory of gravity under consideration. However, in Brans-Dicke-Ni theory, f is only the function of Brans-Dicke scalar field. Carroll and Field have investigated following Brans-Dicke-Ni action [\cite=11]

[formula]

β is some coupling constant. The Brans-Dicke-Ni theory leads to the violation of the Einstein equivalence principle while obeying the weak equivalence principle. Varying the action in Eq.(16) with respect to the scalar field yields

[formula]

Using equation (19), if we perform a conformal transformation in the action S̄ in Eqs.(1) with

[formula]

where f0,φ0 are constants, we find that the dilaton gravity theory becomes the Brans-Dicke-Ni theory

[formula]

where

[formula]

f1,Λ are two integration constants. The potential also consists of four monomials of the scalar field φ and when α = 0,φ0 = 1, it reduces to the potential in Eq.(7). Four dimensional rotating [\cite=12] and Non-rotating [\cite=13] dilaton black hole solutions without the cosmological constant have been found by Sen and Gibbons etc. Via conformal transformation, we are easy to write out their version in the presence of the cosmological constant in the Brans-Dicke-Ni theory. From the resulting solutions, we can conclude that the black hole solution in Brans-Dicke-Ni theory is not yet Kerr-Newman-de Sitter one and λ term in the potential is with respect to the Einstein cosmological constant. Λ term exerts no influences on the properties of the black hole but would make contributions to the evolution of the Universe.

higher dimensional origin of Brans-Dicke scalar field

In the previous sections we have verified that the Brans-Dicke theory is conformal related to the dilaton gravity theory and the corresponding cosmological constant term is derived. In this section, we discuss the higher dimensional origin of the four dimensions Brans-Dicke scalar field. Our discussion is motivated by the elegant work of Gibbons et al [\cite=14]. Consider the (4 + p + q) dimensional vacuum Einstein theory

[formula]

Assume the (4 + p + q) dimensional metric takes the form of

[formula]

We note that the metric is only depend on the coordinates of the four dimensional submanifold. Then the (4 + p + q) dimensional action reduces to the four dimensional one

[formula]

Put

[formula]

then the action reduces to

[formula]

On the other hand, we are aware that the Brans-Dicke theory is given by

[formula]

from which we have the equation of motion

[formula]

Substituting Eq.(29) into Eq.(27) and setting

[formula]

we can find that when

[formula]

Eq.(28) turns out to be

[formula]

Λ is an integration constant. It is exactly the action of Eq.(7) in the absence of the cosmological constant. Thus we see that both Brans-Dicke scalar field and Λ term originate from the extra dimensions of the vacuum Einstein theory.

conclusion and discussion

In conclusion, by applying the conformal transformations, we have derived the cosmological constant term in the Brans-Dicke theory. It is found that, in four dimensions, the resulting black hole solution is just the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter solution in general relativity. However, this is not the truth for higher dimensions. On the other hand, in Brans-Dicke-Ni theory, even in four dimensions, the resulting black hole solution is not yet the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter one. We had better point out that in Brans-Dicke theory, the scalar potential consists of two terms one of which, λ term, is for the Einstein cosmological constant and the other, Λ term, has no counterpart in general relativity. λ term exerts influences on both the properties of the black hole and the evolution of large scale Universe. In contrast, Λ term exerts no influences on the properties of the black hole. But the investigations of some specific forms of this term [\cite=7] [\cite=8] have revealed that it plays some important role in the evolution of the Universe. Thus we should not omit it freely. It is found that both the Brans-Dicke scalar field and the Λ term can be viewed as the contributions of extra dimensions of the vacuum Einstein theory.
