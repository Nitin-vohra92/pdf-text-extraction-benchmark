Maps on posets, and blockers

Introduction

The aim of this note is to present an order-theoretic generalization of Seymour relations [\cite=PDS] which describe the set-theoretic blocker, deletion, and contraction maps on clutters, see ([\ref=Label6]) below. Those relations are a powerful tool of discrete mathematics, see, e.g., [\cite=C] [\cite=CH].

A set H is called a blocking set ( cover, system of representatives, transversal) for a nonempty family [formula] of nonempty subsets of a finite set if it holds [formula], for each [formula]. The family of all inclusion-minimal blocking sets for G is called the blocker of G, see, e.g., [\cite=GLS]. We denote the blocker of G by B(G).

A family of subsets of a finite ground set S is called a clutter or a Sperner family if no set from that family contains another. The empty clutter [formula] containing no subsets of S, and the clutter {} whose unique set is the empty subset [formula] of S, are called the trivial clutters on S. The set-theoretic blocker map assigns to a nontrivial clutter its blocker, and this map alternates the trivial clutters: [formula] and [formula], see, e.g., [\cite=CFM].

Let X  ⊆  S. The set-theoretic deletion [formula], and contraction ( / X) maps on clutters are defined in the following way: if G is a nontrivial clutter on S then the deletion [formula] is the family [formula], and the contraction G / X is the family of all inclusion-minimal sets from the family {G - X: G∈G}. One often says that the clutters [formula] and G  /  X are those on the ground set S - X. The trivial clutters do not change under the deletion and contraction maps: [formula] and [formula].

Let G be a clutter on the ground set S. We have

[formula]

see [\cite=EF] [\cite=L]; given a subset X  ⊆  S, it holds (see [\cite=PDS]):

[formula]

A generalization of relations ([\ref=Label6])

We refer the reader to [\cite=St] for information and terminology in the theory of posets. See, e.g., [\cite=Aigner] on the Galois correspondence and (co)closure operators.

Let L be a finite poset. Let δ:L  →  L be an order-preserving map, and let γ:L  →  L be an order-preserving map such that

[formula]

for all x∈L. Let β:L  →  L be an order-reversing map such that

[formula]

for all x∈L. Either of the relations (for all x∈L):

[formula]

[formula]

implies

[formula]

for any z∈L. Moreover, if β(β(x)) = x, for all x∈L, then either of the equalities β(δ(β(x))) = γ(x) and β(γ(β(x))) = δ(x), for all x∈L, implies

[formula]

for any z∈L.

Relation ([\ref=Label1]) implies because the map β is order-reversing; moreover, we have

We now prove implication ([\ref=Label9])[formula]([\ref=Label8]).

On the one hand, with respect to ([\ref=Label3]), we have δ(β(z))  ≤  β(β(δ(β(z)))). On the other hand, since β is order-reversing, relation ([\ref=Label9]) implies β(β(δ(β(z))))  ≤  β(γ(z)). We obtain

[formula]

Further, on the one hand, relation ([\ref=Label9]) implies γ(β(z))  ≤  β(δ(β(β(z)))). On the other hand, since β(β(z))  ≥  z by ([\ref=Label3]), and δ is order-preserving, and β is order-reversing, we obtain β(δ(β(β(z))))  ≤  β(δ(z)). We conclude that

[formula]

and we are done.

We now prove implication ([\ref=Label11])[formula]([\ref=Label8]).

On the one hand, with respect to ([\ref=Label11]), we have δ(β(z))  ≤  β(γ(β(β(z)))). On the other hand, since β is order-reversing, and γ is order-preserving, relation ([\ref=Label3]) implies β(γ(β(β(z))))  ≤  β(γ(z)). We obtain ([\ref=Label18]).

Further, on the one hand, relation ([\ref=Label3]) implies γ(β(z))  ≤  β(β(γ(β(z)))). On the other hand, since β is order-reversing, relation ([\ref=Label11]) implies β(β(γ(β(z))))  ≤  β(δ(z)). We come to ([\ref=Label19]), and we are done.

The proof of relation ([\ref=Label12]) is now straightforward, with respect to the argument above.

Note that since the map β in Theorem [\ref=Label7] is order-reversing, and ([\ref=Label3]) holds, it is a consequence of [\cite=Aigner] that we have

[formula]

for any x∈L.

To illustrate Theorem [\ref=Label7], we give a comment to ([\ref=Label6]). Let P be a finite bounded poset of cardinality greater than one, whose least element is denoted P. We denote by [formula] and [formula] the order ideal and filter of P generated by an antichain A  ⊂  P, respectively. The atoms of P are the elements covering P; we denote the set of all atoms of P by [formula].

The antichains in P compose a distributive lattice, denoted [formula]. In the present note, the antichains are ordered in the following way: if [formula] then we set We call the least element [formula] and greatest element [formula] of [formula] the trivial antichains in P because, in the context of the present note, those antichains are counterparts of the trivial clutters. Here [formula] is the empty antichain in P, and [formula] is the one-element antichain {P}.

If {a} is a nontrivial one-element antichain in P then the order-theoretic blocker [formula] of {a} in P is the antichain

If A is a nontrivial antichain in P then the order-theoretic blocker [formula] of A in P is the following meet in [formula]:

[formula]

The order-theoretic blockers of the trivial antichains in P are:

See [\cite=BjH] [\cite=BPS] [\cite=M1] [\cite=M2] [\cite=M3] on blockers in posets.

The map [formula] is called the order-theoretic blocker map on [formula]. That map is order-reversing, with the property [formula], for all [formula]. Equality ([\ref=Label10]) implies cf. ([\ref=Label5]). The posets with the property [formula], for all [formula], are characterized in [\cite=BjH].

Let [formula].

If {a} is a nontrivial one-element antichain in P then the order-theoretic deletion [formula] and contraction {a}  /  X of {a} in P are the antichains

[formula]

If A is a nontrivial antichain in P then the order-theoretic deletion [formula] and contraction A / X of A in P are the following joins in [formula]:

[formula]

The order-theoretic deletion and contraction of the trivial antichains in P are:

The map [formula], [formula], is called the operator of deletion on [formula]; it is a coclosure operator on [formula]. The map [formula], A  ↦  A / X, is called the operator of contraction on [formula]; it is a closure operator on [formula] [\cite=M2].

Let the poset L from Theorem [\ref=Label7] be the lattice [formula]. In this context, the maps [formula] are instances of the maps β, δ, and γ from Theorem [\ref=Label7], respectively. In particular, ([\ref=Label9]) and ([\ref=Label11]) read as follows:

For any antichain A in P, the relations

[formula]

hold in [formula].

There is nothing to prove if A is trivial.

Let {a'} be a nontrivial one-element antichain in P.

Suppose that [formula]. In this case we have and

Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. In this case we have and

If [formula] then we have and

Now, let A be an arbitrary nontrivial antichain in P. On the one hand, we by definition ([\ref=Label16]) have in [formula]. On the other hand, for any element a'∈A, we have and in [formula]. Definitions ([\ref=Label15]) now imply relations ([\ref=Label13]) and ([\ref=Label14]).

With the help of relation ([\ref=Label8]) and Lemma [\ref=Label17], we come to the following conclusion:

For any antichain A in P, the relation holds in [formula].
