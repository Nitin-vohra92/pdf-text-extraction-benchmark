Random Multi-Overlap Structures for Optimization problems

Key words and phrases: optimization problems, replica symmetry breaking, ultrametric overlap structures.

Introdution

In the case of non-diluted spin glasses, M. Aizenman R. Sims and S. L. Starr ([\cite=ass]) introduced the idea of Random Overlap Structure (ROSt) to express in a very elegant manner the free energy of the model as the an infimum over a rich probability space, to exhibit an optimal structure (the so-called Boltzmann one), to write down a general trial function through which one can formulate various ansatz's for the free energy of the model. It was also described how to formulate in particular the Parisi ansatz within this formalism. In [\cite=lds1] [\cite=lds2] we extended those results to the case of diluted spin glass (Viana-Bray model). Here we extend the same results to optimization problems, the K-SAT and the p-XOR-SAT. The latter is the simple extension to p-body interactions of the Viana-Bray model, which is the diluted version of the famous model of Sherrington and Kirkpatrick of mean field spin glass. Many of the calculations in the present paper are quite simple and standard, and as general reference with many details the reader can take for instance [\cite=franz].

Model, Notations, Definitions

Consider configurations of Ising spins [formula]. Let Pζ be Poisson random variable of mean ζ, and {iμν} be independent identically distributed random variables, uniformly distributed over points [formula]. If {Jμν} are independent identically distributed copies of a symmetric random variable J =   ±  1, then the Hamiltonian of random K-SAT is Here α  ≥  0 is the degree of connectivity and both p and K are supposed to be even. We do not consider the presence of an external field, but all the results trivially extends to this case as well. By ω we mean the Bolztmann-Gibbs average We will denote by [formula] the average over all the others (quenched) random variables, and the free energy fN per site and its thermodynamic limit are defined by We will use the notation Ω for the product of the needed number of independent copies (replicas) of ω and 〈  ·  〉 for the composition of an [formula]-type average over some quenched variables and some sort of Boltzmann-Gibbs average over the spin variables, to be specified each time. The multi-overlaps are defined (using replicas) by

A Random Multi-Overlap Structure R is a triple (Σ,{n},ξ) where

Σ is a discrete space;

[formula] is a system of random weights;

[formula] is a positive definite Multi-Overlap Kernel.

The Structure of the model

In order to understand what is the underlying structure of the model, it is well known that it is useful to compute the derivative of the free energy with respect to the somewhat basic parameter. In the case of non-diluted spin glasses such parameter the strength of the couplings (and it is equivalent to differentiating with respect to the inverse temperature). In the case of diluted spin glasses such parameter is the connectivity. It is very easy to show (see e.g. [\cite=franz]) by pretty standard calculation that

[formula]

where The fundamental quantities governing the model are therefore the multi-overlap, like for diluted spin glasses ([\cite=lds1] [\cite=lds2]). That is why we use RaMOSt in this context as well. The main difference is that here the function 1 + Qn takes the place of the mere multi-overlaps.

As it should be clear from [\cite=ass] [\cite=lds1] [\cite=lds2], we must therefore introduce also two random variables H̃.(γ,α;) and Ĥ(γ,α;Ĵ) such that

[formula]

Finally, we introduce as expected the following trial function, that we write this first time only considering an external field where H̃i are independent copies of H̃. We will construct explicitly H̃. and Ĥ in the next sections. Let us define

Generalized Bound and Extended Variational Principle

Let us state the extension to the K-SAT model of the results presented in [\cite=ass] [\cite=lds1].

Consider the interpolating Hamiltonian where t is understood to multiply the connectivity, and then it is easy to prove ([\cite=lds1] [\cite=franz] [\cite=ass]) by interpolation the following

The proof is based on observing that R(1) =  - βfN,R(0) = GN and computing the t-derivative of R(t) using the expressions in the previous section

[formula]

where the odd terms are missing since they cancel out. Therefore the derivative above is non-positive since the function xp - pxyp - 1 + (p - 1)yp of x and y is non-negative.

The Boltzmann RaMOSt RB(M) is by definition the one for which Σ  =  { - 1,1}M and, using τ instead of γ, one choses ξτ  =   exp ( - βHM(τ)) and

[formula]

where the independent random variables j.. are uniformly distributed over [formula] and ..,Ĵ.. are independent copies of J. The (limiting) Boltzmann RaMOSt RB fulfills the Reversed Bound ([\cite=ass] [\cite=lds1]) which can be proven in the same way as the analogous theorem 3 of [\cite=lds1], except here we must chose [formula]. As a consequence, one can state the following

It is easy to see that the Boltzmann RaMOSt for the K-SAT is factorized in the sense of section 5 of [\cite=lds1].

Replica Symmetry Breaking and Ultrametric RaMOSt

We are about to extend the results of [\cite=lds2] to the K-SAT by constructing the Ultrametric RaMOSt RU with R-level Replica Symmetry Breaking. The latter corresponds to the choice of [formula] (illustrated e.g. in [\cite=t1]) derived from the Random Probability Cascades, to be used in the case of the K-SAT together with

[formula]

with ũγ,ûγ chosen such that

[formula]

in which Wγ is the same as in the case of diluted p-spin glasses ([\cite=lds2]) where α̃(ρkν) is the infinite volume limit of the Boltzmann-Gibbs average of a random spin from an auxiliary system with a Viana-Bray one-body interaction Hamiltonian at connectivity α̃ ([\cite=lds2]). The indices, the bar, the tilde, the hat mean independent copies of the corresponding variables. Let us now report a comment from [\cite=lds1]. Given any partition {xa}Ra = 0 of the interval

[formula]

considered as the set of trial values of [formula], provided the α̃a are not too large

[formula]

We limit our trial multi-overlaps to belong to partions generated in this way. This implies that the points of the generated partitions tend to get closer to zero as n increases. Which is good, since in any probability space 〈n〉 decreases as n increases and therefore the probability integral distribution functions tend to grow faster near zero. Now put inductively then an elementary calculation shows that

[formula]

with [formula] ultrametric ([\cite=lds2]), i.e. If we denote by X the map α̃a  →  ma satisfying ([\ref=constraint]), we have RU  =  RX,R and the trial function is Notice that the Ultrametric RaMOSt for the K-SAT factorizes exactly like the Boltzmann one, which is optimal.

Conclusions

The RaMOSt is the minimal generalization of the ROSt, and what we showed here and in [\cite=lds1] is that the minimal generalization is enough to formulate the variational principle and also exhibit a concrete RaMOSt analogous to the Parisi one for SK. As a consequence, it is enough to restrict the space of trial functions to those expressible in terms of fixed multi-overlaps (i.e. a set of numbers, not random variables to be averaged).

The p-XOR-SAT

The Hamiltonian of the random p-XOR-SAT coincides with the one of the diluted p-spin glass It is therefore elementary to extend all the results of [\cite=lds1] [\cite=lds2] to this case, also when in presence of an external field. Since it is easy to show ([\cite=lds1]) the structure of the model is the same RaMOSt valid for the case of the Viana-Bray model, but the equality above suggests to try and get the non-negative convex function xp - pxyp - 1 + (p - 1)yp whenever we got the square x2 - 2xy + y2 in the Viana-Bray case. That is why here H̃ and Ĥ are chosen such that

[formula]

and plugged in The Generalized Bound clearly holds, the Boltzmann RaMOSt is the one with (same couplings as the original system) and it is optimal so that we can also state the Extended Variational Principle. The Broken Replica Symmetry Ultrametric RaMOSt (which includes as a trivial case the Replica Symmetric one) relies on the weights ξγ of the Random Probability Cascades as in [\cite=t1] and on

[formula]

with where W̃.γ are independet copies of with .  =    ±  1 symmetric.
