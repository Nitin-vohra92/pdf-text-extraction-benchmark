BARYONIC MIXING AND PRODUCTION OF HYPERNUCLEI

Production of neutron-rich Λ hypernuclei by the (π-,K+) reaction

Interest to neutron-rich Λ hypernuclei was recently stimulated by the KEK experiment.[\cite=Saha] In this experiment, production of neutron-rich hypernuclei 10ΛLi and 12ΛBe by the (π-,K+) reaction was observed at the first time.

We considered[\cite=TL] two mechanisms of this reaction. The first one is the two-step production with meson charge-exchange: π-p  →  π0n, π0p  →  K+Λ or π-p  →  K0Λ, K0p  →  K+n. The second mechanism is the one-step production π-p  →  K+Σ- proceeding via a Σ- doorway state. The Σ- admixture arises from the Λn - Σ-p coupling interaction. The results of our study[\cite=TL] can be summarized as follows.

The cross sections of the (π-,K+) reaction are typically smaller by about three orders of magnitude than those of the "usual" (π+,K+) reaction.

The two-step mechanism is dominant.

Pion and kaon charge exchanges give comparable contributions.

The cross sections of the 10B(π-,K+)10ΛLi reaction are higher than those of the 12C(π-,K+)12ΛBe reaction.

The first and the last conclusions are confirmed qualitatively by the experiment.[\cite=Saha] Comparison of our predictions with the measured data is shown in Table 1. Quantitatively the agreement is relatively poor, which is not, however, so discouraging in view of rather complicated nature of the process and many uncertainties in the input information. It should be noted also that the compared quantities in Table 1 are not of the same meaning strictly, since the theoretical cross sections were summed over all the neutron bound states of the final hypernuclei whereas integration over the whole interval 0 < BΛ < 15 MeV has been performed in the experiment.

The main qualitative disagreement is in the energy dependence of the cross sections. We predicted the cross sections at pπ = 1.05 GeV/c to be about twice as large as those at pπ = 1.2 GeV/c according to the sharp peak of the cross section of the elementary πN  →  KΛ reaction at pπ = 1.05 GeV/c. The experimental ratio is nearly inverse.[\cite=Saha] The energy dependence is still an open problem now.

Here, we would like to suggest a new mechanism of the reaction. It is also a one-step process like production via the Σ- admixture but it is originated from a baryonic admixture in the initial (nuclear) rather than in the final (hypernuclear) state. It is known that Δ baryonic admixtures occur in ordinary nuclei. Then, the π-Δ+  +  →  K+Λ process on this admixture leads just to the reaction considered.

Under usual approximations, the cross section of this process can be estimated as

[formula]

Here [formula] is the cross section of elementary process π-Δ+  +  →  K+Λ. Of course, it can not be measured experimentally. We use the theoretical estimation[\cite=Tms] based on a quark model. Then, pΔ+  + is the probability of the [formula](Z-  2) state, where the nucleus is in some definite, for instance, the ground, state. Recent experiments[\cite=MB] attempted to measure Δ admixture probabilities in nuclei. From these data, we adopt NΔ+  + = 0.4% for 12C. It should be noted that this is the total Δ+  + probability (not related to a certain 10Be state), so pΔ+  + < NΔ+  +. Thus, using NΔ+  + instead of pΔ+  +, we obtain an upper limit for the cross section.

Typical effective numbers Neff for specific states of final Λ hypernuclei are known to be (2-3)·  10- 2 for the 12C target from the theory of the (π+,K+) reaction. Assuming the same values for the reaction considered, we finally estimate [formula](10-15) nb/sr (recall that this is an upper bound) for the 12C(π-,K+)12ΛBe reaction at forward angles.

Comparing this value with the cross sections exhibited in Table 1, we see that the suggested mechanism is at least non-negligible. Of course, existence of the additional mechanism makes the problem still more complicated. On the other hand, it might be rather interesting if Δ admixtures in ordinary nuclei are closely related to the production of neutron-rich Λ hypernuclei, and this mechanism deserves further study.

Double-Λ p shell hypernuclei and ΛΛ  -  ΞN mixing

The ΛΛ  -  ΞN mixing in ΛΛ hypernuclei is possibly the most significant among baryonic mixings in various nuclear systems due to the small (about 25 MeV) mass splitting between ΛΛ and ΞN pairs. Here, we study the effect in p shell hypernuclei, specifically, 12ΛΛBe attainable by the 12C(K-,K+) reaction. We adopt the coupled-channel model similar to that previously applied[\cite=LY] to s shell hypernuclei 5ΛΛH and 5ΛΛHe.

We treat the following coupled channels. The main channel is 10Begs + 2Λ. Here, we consider 1s2Λ(L = 0) and 1p2Λ(L = 0,1,2) states. The second channel is 11Bgs  +  Ξ-, where Ξ- is in a p state. Also the third channel was considered, namely, 11ΞZgs + N, where the ΞN pair possesses zero isospin, and the nucleon is in an s state. The role of the third channel is found to be typically small if the orthogonalization of the s nucleon state to the 1s nucleons within 11ΞZ is performed. On the other hand, the precise value of the probability of this channel depends strongly on input parameters, so we present below the results obtained in the two-channel approximation.

We use phenomenological Woods-Saxon potentials for Λ-nucleus and Ξ-nucleus interactions. For diagonal ΛΛ and coupling ΛΛ  -  ΞN interactions, potentials[\cite=LY] derived from G matrix calculations with various meson-exchange Nijmegen models[\cite=Nij] are employed.

In Fig. 1, ΔBΛΛ values (upper panel) and Ξ channel probabilities pΞ (lower panel) are presented for various Nijmegen models as functions of volume integral [formula]. First, it is seen that the contribution of the coupling interaction to the energy of the ground (1s2Λ) state may be considerable. For instance, the ΔBΛΛ values for the weakest coupling (Nijmegen hard-core D model, the leftmost point) and for the strongest coupling (Nijmegen hard-core F model, the rightmost point) differ by about 2 MeV. In the latter case, ΔBΛΛ is as large as almost 4 MeV (note that all the interactions are fitted to ΔBΛΛ(6ΛΛHe) = 1 MeV, see Ref. ). On the other hand, the Ξ probability is not substantially greater than 1% anyway.

A stronger coupling effect may be expected in the 1p2Λ states since they lie much closer in energy to the Ξ hypernuclear spectrum. It is seen in Fig. 1 that this is just the case for the L = S = 0 state: [formula] for strong coupling potentials exceeds the ground state value, though loosely bound hyperons move rather far from each other. For the strongest coupling, ΔBΛΛ reaches a huge value about 6 MeV. Contrary to the ground state, the Ξ probabilities may be also rather great.

On the other hand, the coupling effect is relatively small for the L = 2 state and extremely small for the L = 1 state (the latter is not shown in Fig. 1). So the coupling can split levels almost degenerated without it.

The most interesting point observed here is probably the possibility of rather large mixing in the 1p2Λ(L = 0) state. Due to small energy separation from the Ξ hypernuclear spectrum, excited double-Λ hypernuclei can be essentially states with comparable weights of the ΛΛ and ΞN (and possibly also ΣΣ not considered here) components. Large Ξ admixtures generally imply relatively large production rates in the (K-,K+) reaction via Ξ- doorway states and the one-step K-p  →  K+Ξ- process[\cite=DGM] similar to the mechanisms considered in Sec. 1. Note that the Ξ- probabilities obtained for 12ΛΛBe are greater by several orders of magnitude than the Σ- probabilities[\cite=TL] in the neutron-rich Λ hypernuclei. However, the production rate for the specific 1p2Λ(L = 0) state in 12ΛΛBe is evidently small since the 0+  →  0+ transition is strongly suppressed in the (K-,K+) reaction due to a large momentum transfer. Search for ΛΛ hypernuclear states with considerable Ξ admixtures and yet producible with reasonable rates is a challenging problem.

How to inject the Θ pentaquark into a nucleus?

The recent discovery of positive-strangeness baryon Θ+ (Ref. ; further references are collected in Ref. ) is one of the most exciting events in particle/nuclear physics. So far, most of experimental activities, either performed or planned, are focused on static properties of the pentaquark.

Several theoretical groups studied Θ interaction with nuclei and possibility of Θ nuclei existence.[\cite=ThN] By analogy with hypernuclei, such systems may be named pentanuclei. It is notable that, while a number of different approaches was applied, attraction between Θ and nucleons was deduced in all the papers,[\cite=ThN] though nuclear wells vary from very shallow to a deep one enough even to stabilize the system with respect to strong decays.

We do not deal with any specific model of Θ-nucleus interaction. Instead, just the question formulated in the heading of this Sec. is addressed.

It is well known that the key point for production of "usual" hypernuclei is the kinematical conditions. For instance, the main ways to form Λ hypernuclei are the (K,π) reaction, where Λ can be produced recoillessly (with zero momentum), as well as the (π,K) and (γ,K) reactions providing Λ momenta nonzero, but comparable to the nucleon Fermi momentum.

Since Θ is heavier than hyperons, the momenta transferred to Θ produced from a single nucleon (γN  →  qΘ, πN  →  qΘ, KN  →  πΘ) are rather high (upper curves in Fig. 2). The minimal momentum transfer in these reactions is 635 MeV/c reached in the (K,π) reaction at 900 MeV/c. The momenta transfer in the γ- and π-induced reactions (as well as for nucleon-induced production, which is not shown in Fig. 2) are still higher.

We suggest another type of reactions, namely, production of Θ from a nucleon pair. It is seen from Fig. 2 that reactions γNN  →  ΘY, πNN  →  ΘY and KNN  →  ΘN, where Y is Λ or Σ, provide really recoilless kinematics. It is important that the momenta transfer remain small compared to the nucleon Fermi momentum in a wide range of the incident momentum. The relevant nuclear reactions are as follows: AZ[formula]Z', AZ[formula]Z' and AZ[formula]Z', so the reactions are binary, like the usual reactions of hypernuclear production, but detection of baryons (instead of mesons) is needed.

Usually cross sections of hypernuclear production are factorized into an elementary production cross section and an effective number involving nuclear properties. Effective numbers for the recoilless kinematics may be expected to be greater by several orders of magnitude than those at the momenta transfer exceeding 600 MeV/c. On the other hand, the cross sections of the elementary (two-nucleon) processes may be small.

To get some rough estimation, we deal with pentanucleus production on deuteron clusters and consider cross sections summed over all final states using the closure approximation in lines of Ref. . We have

[formula]

where Nd is the deuteron cluster number taken from a cluster model[\cite=KR], Sdist is the distortion factor derived using the eikonal approximation.

Any experimental information on the reactions ad  →  BΘ, where B is a baryon, is still absent. The reaction γd  →  ΘY was considered theoretically.[\cite=Guz] So we performed estimations for the 12C[formula]C reaction.

Using the cross sections from Ref. , we estimate the summed cross section as follows: [formula], 10 and 2 nb/sr at Eγ = 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 GeV, respectively. Such cross sections are evidently measurable at existing facilities. It should be noted, however, that the elementary cross sections in the model[\cite=Guz] are proportional to the unknown Θ width, and the calculations[\cite=Guz] have been performed at an arbitrary value of 5 MeV. If the Θ width is about 1 MeV as argued recently,[\cite=Cahn] the cross sections must be reduced by the factor of 5.

The summed cross section is not directly related to production of low-lying pentanuclear states, but gives rather an upper bound. From the theory of the AZ[formula]Z reaction (also recoilless) it has been known[\cite=Boy] that about a half of the summed cross section is contributed by low-lying substitutional states for the 12C target. So one may expect that the fraction of the low-lying pentanuclear states in the summed cross section is also substantial.

Of course, it is rather problematic now to predict the elementary cross sections reliably, so the experimental data on the ad  →  BΘ reactions are strongly needed. The g10 experiment at TJNAF, in which the γd  →  ΛΘ reaction is studied,[\cite=CEBAF] is encouraging from this point of view. The reaction [formula]He with Λ emission[\cite=CEBAF] is also rather interesting since pentadeuteron 2ΘHe can be produced, if it exists. On the other hand, the meson-induced reactions deserve study as well.

To conclude this section, the pentaquark production from a nucleon pair is probably the most promising way for formation of Θ nuclei (pentanuclei).
