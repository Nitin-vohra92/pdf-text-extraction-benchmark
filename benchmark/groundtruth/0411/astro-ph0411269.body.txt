Mg II Absorbing Galaxies: Morphologies and Kinematics

Quasar Absorption Lines: Further and Farther

From the study of the Galaxy and local galaxies, the disk/halo interface is now known to be a dynamic region, probably built in response to star forming regions and the infall of "high velocity clouds" (HVCs). Using sensitive 21-cm emission line imaging of local galaxies, several contributers of this meeting have reported himneys, fountains, superbubbles, and holes (see contributions throughout this volume). Extending somewhat further into the halo are the so-called " beards" [\citep=sancisi01] and "forbidden gas" complexes [\citep=fraternali02]. Beards are cold neutral gas structures several kpc from the disks that depart from galaxy rotation by as much as ~  50-100 km s- 1; they are suggestive of a "lagging halo". Forbidden gas structures have kinematics that run counter to the galaxy. The diffuse interstellar gas (DIGs) in local galaxies is seen out to ~  10 kpc above the galactic disks [\cite=swater97] [\cite=rand00]. DIG gas often exhibits decreasing rotational velocities with height above the disk (i.e., "halo lag"). Simple fountain flow models are consistent with this behavior [\citep=collins02].

In order to make greater sense of these observations and ultimately of the role of gas in galaxy evolution, it would be desirable to build an observational bridge connecting slightly earlier cosmic epochs to the present. It would also be desirable to probe further out into the galactic halos in order to firmly establish the nature of gas far from galaxy disks. The technique of quasar absorption lines is uniquely suited to the task; it provides a natural window on the gaseous conditions in galaxies over a broad range of redshifts (cosmic epochs) and allows for the study of both the inner and outer regions of galaxies and their halos.

Mg II Absorption: Case for the Ideal Probe

The strong resonant λλ2796,2803 doublet in absorption is quite arguably the best tracer of metal-enriched gas associated with galaxies. absorption is common and easily spotted in quasar spectra. Furthermore, magnesium, an α-process element, is ejected by supernovae into interstellar, intergroup, and intergalactic space from the epoch of the very first generation of stars at the highest redshifts. Since absorption is known to arise in gas spanning five decades of neutral hydrogen column density, from [formula] to 20.5 atoms cm- 2 [\citep=ber86] [\citep=weakI], it samples a large range of astrophysical environments near star forming and post-star forming regions (i.e., galaxies).

Absorption-Selected Galaxies

Following the initial study by [\citet=bb91], [\citet=sdp94], obtained images of roughly 50 quasar fields and identified the "absorption-selected galaxies" associated with strong systems. Their study firmly established a connection between the galaxy luminosities and colors and the extent of their gaseous " absorbing envelopes" for 0.3  ≤  z  ≤  1.0

As shown in the left and center panels of Figure [\ref=fig:BKlum], the luminosities of selected galaxies exhibit little evolution with redshift. However, there is differential evolution in the luminosity function [\citep=lilly96] [\citep=guillemin97] in that faint blue galaxies are apparently under abundant; they are not selected in a survey using gas cross section, seen as a turn down at the faint-end of the B-band luminosity. This is a quandary in that low mass halos of star forming galaxies are most expected to have large gas cross sections (as will be discussed below, this may be a selection bias).

[\citet=steidel95] showed that the sizes of "halos" scale weakly with galaxy luminosity, following, [formula] kpc. This relationship, illustrated in the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:RLK], was determined by plotting the impact parameter as a function of host galaxy luminosity and maximizing the number of absorbing galaxies (open circles) below the R(LK) relation and the number of non-absorbing galaxies (solid triangles) above the R(LK) relation. From the clean demarcation (as marked by the dashed line) it was inferred that the halos are roughly spherical and have unity covering factors and sharp boundaries for [formula] Å (the dotted line is the canonical Holmberg slope 0.4, normalized at D  =  38h- 1 kpc).

As illustrated in the right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:RLK], the gas cross section for [formula] Å is ~  40 kpc and is statistically consistent the extent of gas optically thick at the Lyman limit of neutral hydrogen (i.e., LLS). However, for the so-called weak absorbers, those with [formula] Å [\citep=weakI], little is known about what galaxy types are selected. If it is assumed that normal bright galaxies give rise to weak absorption, then, using the normalization appropriate for the luminosity functions presented in Figure {[\ref=fig:BKlum], their gas cross section is ~  70 kpc and is consistent with the region occupied by strong absorbing gas.

Need for Complete Census

For all that has been accomplished to date, it is probable the scenario of a spherical distribution of gas with unity covering factor may be oversimplified, or a result of survey methodology. Indeed, the SDP survey remains relatively imcomplete in that 30% of the absorbing galaxies in the fields do have spectroscopically measured redshifts (i.e., are to be at the absorption redshift).

Though 25 "control" fields, in which none of the galaxies gave rise to strong absorption, were systematically studied (i.e., all galaxies having [formula] within 10arcsec have measured photometry and spectroscopic redshifts), this was not the case for the 52 fields with absorbing galaxies. In these latter fields, the spectroscopic redshifts were not completed out to a fixed radius around the quasars; once a galaxy was identified at the absorber redshift, no further redshifts were determined in the field. The galaxy spectroscopy was performed in an outward pattern from the quasar and galaxies that were targeted were based upon their magnitudes and colors being consistent with the absorber redshift. Close in galaxies of unexpected luminosity and color and further out galaxies could have been missed as potential absorbers [\citep=bbp95].

Thus, there is the very real possibility that some galaxies have been misidentified as the absorber, or their may be more than one galaxy giving rise to the absorption. Such incompleteness in the survey could have strong implications on our inference of the covering factor, luminosity functions, and geometric model of the absorbing gas halos. [\citet=cc96] studied the effects of incompleteness and possible misidentifications in the SDP survey and concluded that the realization of absorbing/non-absorbing galaxies shown in Figure [\ref=fig:RLK] obtained by Steidel (1995) was not improbable for the survey methods even if the covering factor was as small as 70%.

For only a single quasar field, that of 3C 336 has a thorough census of absorbing and non-absorbing galaxies been completed [\citep=steidel97]. This rich field had four known strong absorbers, but in the course of the study two additional weaker systems were found with [formula] Å! A deep WFPC-2/HST image of the field was obtained and every galaxy within 50arcsec of the quasar in the field with [formula] was spectroscopically redshifted.

A Damped absorber (DLA), still remains unidentified. Interestingly, there is a galaxy at the DLA redshift; if it is the absorbing galaxy it lies well outside the R(LK) relation ([formula] and D = 65h- 1 kpc) and has an extraordinarly large [formula] for this impact parameter.

Furthermore, at least one non-absorbing galaxy was identified that is well below the R(LK) relation so that it would be predicted to give rise to strong . An after-the-fact search for absorbtion in the HIRES/Keck spectrum was inconclusive; this galaxy may host very weak absorber. For each of two additional cases, there are two galaxies having redshifts coincident with the absorption redshift.

Over the last decade, several quasar fields have been reexamined by us in a patch work effort and a disturbing number of misidentifications and multiple galaxies at the absorption redshift have indeed been found! For example, in one case, a galaxy at 70h- 1 kpc was found to be the absorber, not the assumed galaxy at 30h- 1 kpc. This case again demonstrates that some of the absorbing galaxies lie well above the R(LK) relation (see Figure [\ref=fig:RLK]).

In another case, the spectroscopic redshift of a galaxy thought to be associated with a strong absorber revealed it to be at a redshift with no known absorption . When reexamined with higher senstivity quasar spectra, the galaxy was found to align with a weak absorber at a different redshift; there is no obvious galaxy candidate in the field for the strong absorber! In the SDP survey, the galaxy associated with weak , if properly identified, would have been a non-absorber below the R(LK) relation.

In yet another field, a double galaxy was found at the absorber redshift; the assumed galaxy was not the absorber. Their are at least two other fields in which three or more galaxies are clustered at the absorption redshift.

Clearly, our recent work and the complete analysis of the 3C 336 field has provided examples of departures from the conclusions drawn by SDP. What is also very important to realize is that the HIRES/Keck quasar spectroscopy that has uncovered weak absorption has shed new levels of sensitivity and complications on the whole halo gas-galaxy connection. Some galaxies show weak absorption at smaller galactocentric distances and some show it at larger galactocentric distances. Armed with a factor of 10 increase in sensitivity to absorption using HIRES/Keck, we now have the potential leverage to probe the patchiness of the halos and measure the covering factor at much more sensitive column density thresholds. All this, of course, hinges on the paramount objective of obtaining an unbiased, accurate, and complete census of the galaxies.

Galaxy Morphologies and Gas Kinematics

There has been a fair amount of activity in examining the kinematics of z  ≤  1 absorbers and comparing them with the gross properties of the absorbing galaxies [\citep=lb92] [\citep=csv96] [\citep=archiveII] [\citep=cv01]. However, knowledge of the galaxy has been limited to the photometric magnitudes, B - K colors, and the observed impact parameters.

The sample size has remained relatively small, about 15 absorption system/absorbing galaxy pairs. These studies have not provided any clear systematic trends to elucidate the nature of absorbing gas in relation to the galaxies. The "scatter" in the properties is simply too high for statisitcally significant trends to be seen in the small sample. If systematic kinematics do exists, it is highly probable that additional "parameters" are at play that once invoked can illucidate the systematics. Thus, it is also of supreme importance to explore kinematic connections with the galaxy morphologies, the line of sight paths of the quasar light, and the kinematics of the galaxies themselves.

In Figure [\ref=fig:collage] we show the galaxy morphologies and λ2796 absorption profile kinematics as a function of the quasar-galaxy impact parameter for 10 galaxies. The galaxy images have been obtained with WFPC-2/HST and the profiles with HIRES/Keck. The images are 2 arcsec   ×  2 arcsec ; the galaxy impact parameters are given in the upper portion of the panels and the redshifts in the lower portion. The absorbing gas is shown in the galaxy rest-frame velocity from - 220 to 220 km s- 1 (the zero points are arbitrary). The absorption exhibits a wide range of kinematic complexity, with velocity spreads of ~  150 km s- 1, at various impact parameters. Ticks above the profiles give the numbers and velocities of subcomponents, based upon χ2 Voigt profile fitting [\citep=cv01] [\citep=cvc03].

We have used GIM2D [\citep=simard] to model the galaxy morphologies for 26 absorbing galaxies [\citep=glennk]. In Figure [\ref=fig:glennfig], we show, from top left to top right, the HST image, the two-component GIM2D model, and the model residuals. , i.e., [formula]. North is oreinted up and east to the left. Note the striking asymmetric bar structure and the "tail" extending to the southeast. These structures are not immediately apparent in the data prior to modeling. We have found that similar levels of asymmetric structures are present in many of the galaxies in our sample. That is, the galaxy morphologies appear fairly normal prior to examination of the model residuals [\citep=steidel98] [\citep=glennk].

For each galaxy in our sample, we have quantified the residual asymmetries using the parameter RA [\citep=schade95] for 3 ~ σ residuals out to twice the half light radius, R1 / 2. When RA  >  0.05, the galaxy is considered to have significant morphological assymetry (rotated [formula] about the galaxy axis). In the lower panel of Figure [\ref=fig:glennfig], we plot RA versus Ncl, the number of "clouds" (Voigt profile components) comprising the absorption profile. Filled data points have [formula] Å and open data points have [formula] Å. Note that 18 of the 26 galaxies are catagorized as having significant asymmetric morphologies.

We limit further discussion to those systems with [formula] Å. These are "classical" systems, whereas those with larger [formula] typically are "double" systems; those with [formula] Å are typically DLAs with severe profile saturation [\citep=archiveII]. There is a 2.8 ~ σ correlation between RA for the galaxy and Ncl for the absorbing gas. The dotted line through the data is not a fit, only a guide for the eye.

We also tested for correlations between gas kinematics and galaxy orientation. Orientation was parameterized by the angle between the galaxy major axis and the quasar sightline, and by the inclination of the galaxy. Only three of our 26 galaxies are ellipticals. We also examined orientation normalized to the galaxy luminosity and the quasar-galaxy impact parameter. No significant correlations were found.

First Hints of a Galaxy-Halo Gas Kinematic Connection

At least in our moderate sized sample, there is no clear indication that the geometric cross section and kinematics of the gas is closely related to orientation of the line of sight through the galaxy "halo". However, the correlation between galaxy morphological asymmetry and the number of clouds intercepted by the quasar sightline is our first hint of a connection between the galaxy proporties and the gaseous conditions in extended gas. It suggests that gravitational disturbance, possibly due to a previous merging or accretion event, may have induced a stirring of gas surrounding the galaxy. Such disturbances are often seen in local galaxies from 21-cm studies [\citep=hibbard01]. The fact that, for our sample, the luminous morphologies of the galaxies are fairly normal would imply that the events are not neccessarily violent, or that they occured a few dynamical times prior to the epoch of observation.

Ultimatley, we need to obtain the kinematics of the luminous components of the galaxies. [\citet=steidel02] recently conducted a detailed study comparing the galaxy kinematics to the gas kinematics for five absorbers. We caution that these galaxies are all edge-on spirals, and not representative of the overall population of absorption-selected galaxies. For four of the five, the absorbing gas kinematics is rotating in the same sense as the galaxy; however, the total spread of gas velocities is inconsistent with simple disk rotation. In three of the five cases, the gas kinematics can be explained if the halo rotation "lags" the galaxy disk rotation, as is seen with DIGs and "beards" in local galaxies [\citep=swater97] [\citep=rand00], but we are probing much higher in the halo. As a caveat, we offer a counter example: [\citet=ellison03] showed that the gas kinematics in an edge-on spiral galaxy toward MC 1331 + 170 does not fully follow the disk rotation. Some of the gas is akin to the aforementioned "forbidden" gas, moving opposite to the rotation [\citep=fraternali02].
