Group velocity of the acoustic eigen-modes in sonic crystals

The phenomenon of band structures, revealed as waves propagate through periodic structures, was put on a solid foundation in the context of Bloch's theorem[\cite=Bloch]. It was first studied for electronic systems. Since the central physics behind electronic band structures lies in the wave nature of electrons, it is natural to extend the study to any wave systems in general, and to electromagnetic (EM) and acoustic systems in particular.

Not excluding other efforts, band structures were earlier addressed for general waves in periodic structures by Brillouin[\cite=Bri], then to EM waves by Yariv and Yeh[\cite=Yariv], later by Yablonovitch[\cite=Yab] and John[\cite=John]. Since then, the study of EM waves in periodic structures has been booming, eventually extended to the exploration of acoustic waves in periodic structures (e. g. Refs. [\cite=Dowling] [\cite=sanchez1] [\cite=sanchez2] [\cite=Kush]), leading to the establishment of the field of photonic crystals (PCs) and sonic crystals (SCs).

Sonic crystals (SCs) are made of periodically structured materials which are sensitive to acoustic waves, and have been studied both intensively and extensively. The exciting phenomenon of band structures in sonic crystals allows for many possible applications. It has been recognized that SCs could be used as sound shields, acoustic filters, acoustic flow guiding, sonic crystal lenses, and so on[\cite=sanchez1] [\cite=sanchez2] [\cite=caba1] [\cite=rober] [\cite=sanchis] [\cite=kuswa] [\cite=Ye_lens] [\cite=Ye_APL].

One of the top issues in the research of acoustic crystals is how to describe the propagation of acoustic waves in crystal structures, by analogy with the photonic crystals. The common theoretical approach to electromagnetic propagation in periodic media has been given in Ref. [\cite=Yariv], and may be summarized as follows[\cite=Ye_Energy]. The Maxwell equations are first derived for waves in periodic media. By Bloch theorem, the solution can be expanded in terms of Bloch waves. The solution is then substituted into the governing equations to obtain an eigen-equation that determines the dispersion relations between the frequency and the wave vector that lies within the first Brillouin zone for the eigen-modes. These relations are termed as frequency band structures. Since it has been proved[\cite=Yariv] [\cite=Sakoda] that the averaged energy velocity [formula] equals the group velocity which can be obtained as the gradient of the dispersion relations with the respect to the space of wave vectors, i. e. [formula], the investigation of electromagnetic propagation in periodic structures is thus reduced to the calculation of the group velocity from the band structures.

Simply due to similarities between the electromagnetic and acoustic waves, it is naturally expected that the above prescription can be automatically adopted for sonic crystals, and this recipe has been indeed used for SCs in the literature (e. g. Ref. [\cite=CTChan]). To the best of our knowledge, however, so far there has been no attempt in the literature to prove this analogy and connection between PCs and SCs. Here, we wish to bridge the gap. In this paper, we will provide a proof that in analogy with PCs, the acoustic energy velocity of the eigen-modes of a sonic crystal averaged within a unit cell also equals the group velocity of these eigen-modes, defined as [formula]. Moreover, we will discuss how the group velocity can be used to describe acoustic energy flows in sonic crystals. In addition, following the work on photonic crystals[\cite=Luan], it will be shown that measuring the unit-cell volume averaged acoustic energy velocity can be reduced to the measurement of the corresponding unit-cell surface averaged components. Such a reduction is expected to facilitate the practical measurement of acoustic energy flows.

General - In the linear region, the propagation of acoustic waves are governed by three physical principles: Newton's second law, conservation law, and equation of states. And acoustic waves are characterized by three major physical quantities: variations in pressure and mass density, and the displacement velocity, denoted respectively by δp, δρ, and [formula]. The governing equations are then

[formula]

These equations lead to

[formula]

So we have two main equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where we ignore 'δ'.

From Eqs. ([\ref=eq:scm1]) and ([\ref=eq:scm2]), we have the wave equation

[formula]

Multiplying Eq. ([\ref=eq:scm1]) with [formula], and multiplying Eq. ([\ref=eq:scm2]) with [formula], and then adding the correspondingly the complex conjugated equations, we will get

[formula]

This equation can be written as

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Eq. ([\ref=eq:cons]) represents the energy conservation. The quantities [formula] and U are the acoustic intensity and energy respectively.

Proof of [formula] - Now we consider sonic crystals. We will consider three dimensional cases; the extension to two dimensions is straightforward. The band structures can be readily computed by the plane-wave method. Here we assume that the band structure is known. Readers may refer to Ref. [\cite=Kush] for details. We will prove that the acoustic energy velocity of the eigen-modes of a sonic crystal averaged within a unit cell equals the group velocity of these eigen-modes.

Considering monochromatic waves in sonic crystals, from Eqs. ([\ref=eq:scm1]) and ([\ref=eq:scm2])

[formula]

Hereafter we drop out the time factor e- iωt.

According to Bloch's theorem, waves of the eigen-modes in periodic structures can be expressed in terms of Bloch functions,

[formula]

Taking these two equations into Eqs. ([\ref=eq:scc3]) and ([\ref=eq:scc4]), we have

[formula]

Considering an arbitrary infinitesimal change in [formula], which induces the changes in ω, u, and p, Eqs. ([\ref=eq:scc5]) and ([\ref=eq:scc6]) become

The corresponding complex conjugates are

Multiplying Eq. ([\ref=eq:scc7]) with [formula], and Eq. ([\ref=eq:scc9]) with [formula], then making a subtraction between the two resulting equations, we have where

[formula]

Multiplying Eq. ([\ref=eq:scc8]) with [formula], and Eq. ([\ref=eq:scc10]) with [formula], then making a subtraction between the two resulting equations, we have

Adding Eqs. ([\ref=eq:scc11]) and ([\ref=eq:scc12]), and taking into account Eqs. ([\ref=eq:scc5]) and ([\ref=eq:scc6]), we have Due to the periodicity, the unit cell integration for any periodic function [formula] can be shown to be zero, i. e. [formula] Now performing the unit cell integration for Eq. ([\ref=eq:scf1]), we have

[formula]

where [formula], with Vc being the volume of the unit cell.

We define the unit-cell volume averaged energy velocity as

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have finally proved the identity for the group velocity defined as [formula]:

[formula]

When the index [formula] for the eigen-mode is ignored, we simply have

[formula]

with [formula] which was first derived for PCs.

From the above, we know that [formula] may describe the averaged energy flow in sonic crystals. For example, the direction of averaged energy follows that of [formula]. As such, in the study of photonic crystals, [formula] is regarded as the key quantity in discerning the photonic flows. Here, however, we must stress that the average of the energy velocity is performed over the whole unit cell of periodic media, under what condition such averaged energy flow can depict the actual energy flow in periodic media is worth considering. Moreover, since in actual measurements it is often hard to detect the physical quantities inside the periodic media, how to obtain the group velocity without having to put a detector into the media needs also to be considered. In the following, we will consider these two questions.

First, due to the periodicity, the local acoustic current of the eigen-modes can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the reciprocal vectors. It is shown that

[formula]

From this result, we clearly see that when and only when the component with [formula] dominates, the group velocity [formula] can represent well the actual wave flows. In this case, the eigen-modes will behave effectively as a plane wave in a free space. Some recent studies indicate that this may not be generally valid, and have caused in certain circumstances some confusions about whether waves are diffracted or refracted, referring to the discussions in Refs. [\cite=PLA] [\cite=CJP]. Additionally, when a crystal is ensonified by an external wave, many eigen-modes may be excited for a given frequency, adding complications to the determination of the actual acoustic propagation.

Reduction of integration - Second, it can be shown that the unit volume averaged acoustic intensity [formula] can be represented by surface averaged acoustic intensity. This is important, since it will allow us to measure certain physical quantities at surfaces rather than putting detectors into the volume of samples. To briefly show this, we will take the procedure stemming from the excellent note [\cite=Luan]. For details, readers should refer to Ref. [\cite=Luan].

We consider an acoustic lattice with the base lattice vectors [formula], [formula], and [formula]. The base vectors for the reciprocal lattice [formula] and [formula] are determined by [formula]. We will show that

[formula]

where i is the unit vector of [formula], given by [formula], and Si denotes the three surfaces of a unit cell, characterized by [formula], [formula], [formula] respectively.

For the stationary case, i. e. [formula], we have from Eq. ([\ref=eq:r33])

[formula]

To show the identity in Eq. ([\ref=eq:r1]), we consider the surface S3 as the example. Writing [formula], we have

[formula]

Applying Eq. ([\ref=eq:GJ]) to Eq. ([\ref=eq:r30]), we arrive at

[formula]

From Eq. ([\ref=eq:r33]) and by comparing to Eq. ([\ref=eq:r2]), we get

[formula]

Following the same procedure, we can have the similar results for the other two surfaces. Thereby we prove

[formula]

This result indicates that the components of the volume averaged acoustic intensity can be reduced to the surface averaged counterparts. Clearly, this is expected to be very useful to actual measurements.

In summary, we have provided a proof that in analogy with PCs, the acoustic energy velocity of the eigen-modes of a sonic crystal averaged within a unit cell also equals the group velocity of these eigen-modes, defined as [formula]. We have also discussed the conditions that the group velocity can be used to describe acoustic energy flows in sonic crystals. Then it is shown that the volume averaged acoustic energy velocity can be reduced to the surface averaged components.
