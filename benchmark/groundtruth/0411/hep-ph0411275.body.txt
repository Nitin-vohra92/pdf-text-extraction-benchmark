Approximate solutions for the Higgs masses and couplings in the NMSSM

Introduction

The minimal SUSY version of the Standard Model (SM) stabilizing the mass hierarchy does not provide any explanation for its origin.Indeed the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) being incorporated in the supergravity theories leads to the [formula]. Within supergravity models the full superpotential is usually represented as an expansion in powers of observable superfields Ĉα

[formula]

where hm and Ŵ0(hm) are the "hidden" sector fields and its superpotential respectively. The "hidden" sector fields acquire vacuum expectation values of the order of Planck scale (MPl) breaking local supersymmetry and generating a set of soft masses and couplings in the observable sector. From dimensional considerations one would naturally expect the parameter μ to be either zero or the Planck scale. If μ = 0 then the minimum of the Higgs boson potential occurs for 〈H1〉 = 0 and down quarks and charged leptons remain massless. In the opposite case, when the values of μ  ~  MPl, there is no spontaneous breakdown of SU(2)  ×  U(1) symmetry at all since the Higgs scalars get a huge positive contribution μ2 to their squared masses. In order to provide the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking, μ is required to be of the order of the electroweak scale.

In the simplest extension of the MSSM, the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) [\cite=3] [\cite=5], the superpotential is invariant with respect to the discrete transformations Ĉα' = e2πi / 3Cα of the Z3 group. The term μ(Ĥ1Ĥ2) does not meet this requirement. Therefore it is replaced in the superpotential by

[formula]

where Ŝ is an additional superfield which is a singlet with respect to SU(2) and U(1) gauge transformations. A spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry leads to the emergence of the vacuum expectation value of the extra singlet field [formula] and an effective μ-term is generated ([formula]). The Z3 symmetry of the superpotential naturally arises in string inspired models, where all observable fields are massless in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry.

In this paper we investigate the Higgs masses and their couplings to the Z-boson in the NMSSM using approximate solutions. In Section 2 we specify the Higgs sector of the model. In section 3 the exact Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry limit in the NMSSM is studied and approximate solutions for the Higgs masses and couplings are obtained. The scenario of soft PQ-symmetry breaking is discussed in section 4. In section 5 we summarize our results .

NMSSM Higgs sector

The NMSSM Higgs sector involves two Higgs doublets H1,2 and one singlet field S. The interactions of the extra complex scalar S with other particles is defined by the superpotential ([\ref=4]) that leads to a Higgs boson potential of the following form:

[formula]

where g and g' are SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings respectively, while ΔV corresponds to the contribution of loop corrections. The couplings g,  g',  λ and κ do not violate supersymmetry. The set of soft SUSY breaking parameters includes soft masses m21,  m22,  m2S and trilinear couplings Aκ,  Aλ.

At the physical minimum of the potential ([\ref=5]) the neutral components of the Higgs doublets H1 and H2 develop vacuum expectation values v1 and v2 breaking the electroweak symmetry down to U(1). Upon the breakdown of SU(2)  ×  U(1) symmetry three goldstone modes (G± and G0) emerge, and are absorbed by the W± and Z bosons. In the field space basis rotated by an angle β (tan β = v2 / v1) with respect to the initial direction

[formula]

these unphysical degrees of freedom are removed by a gauge transformation and the mass terms in the Higgs boson potential can be written as follows

[formula]

where we replace the real parts of the neutral components of the Higgs doublets by their superpositions H  ,h so that

[formula]

From the conditions for the extrema [formula] of the Higgs effective potential ([\ref=5]) one can express m2S, m21, m22 via other fundamental parameters, β and s. Substituting the obtained relations for the soft masses in the 2  ×  2 CP-odd mass matrix 2ij we get:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] and ij are contributions of the loop corrections to the mass matrix elements. The mass matrix ([\ref=14]) can be easily diagonalized via a rotation of the fields P and PS by an angle θA (tan 2θA = 2212 / (211  -  222)) .

The charged Higgs fields H± are already physical mass eigenstates with

[formula]

Here [formula] is the charged W-boson mass and Δ± includes loop corrections to the charged Higgs masses.

In the rotated basis H  ,h  ,N the matrix elements of the 3  ×  3 mass matrix of the CP-even Higgs sector can be written as [\cite=6]-[\cite=7]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Z-boson mass, [formula], and Δij can be calculated by differentiating ΔV [\cite=6]. Since the minimal eigenvalue of a matrix does not exceed its smallest diagonal element, at least one Higgs scalar in the CP-even sector has to be comparatively light: [formula]. At the tree level the upper bound on the lightest Higgs mass in the NMSSM was found in [\cite=5]. It differs from the corresponding theoretical limit in the minimal SUSY model only for moderate values of tan β. As in the MSSM the loop corrections from the t-quark and its superpartners raise the value of the upper bound on the lightest Higgs mass resulting in a rather strict restriction on mh1  ≤  135   [\cite=8]. The Higgs sector of the NMSSM and loop corrections to it were studied in [\cite=9].

In the field basis P,  PS,  H,  h,  N the trilinear part of the Lagrangian, which is responsible for the interaction of the neutral Higgs states with the Z-boson, is simplified:

[formula]

Only one CP-even component, h, couples to a pair of Z-bosons while another, H, interacts with pseudoscalar P and Z. The coupling of h to the Z pair is exactly the same as in the SM. In the Yukawa interactions with fermions h also manifests itself as the SM like Higgs boson.

The couplings of the physical Higgs scalars to the Z pair (gZZi, i = 1,2,3) and to the Higgs pseudoscalars and Z boson (gZA1i and gZA2i) appear due to the mixing of h,H and P with other components of the CP-odd and CP-even Higgs sectors. Following the traditional notation we define the normalized R-couplings as: [formula] and [formula]. All relative R-couplings vary from zero to unity and are given by

[formula]

where Uij is unitary matrix relating components of the field basis H,  h, and N to the physical CP-even Higgs eigenstates.

Exact Peccei-Quinn symmetry limit

First of all let us discuss the NMSSM with κ = 0. At the tree level the Higgs masses and couplings in this model depend on four parameters: λ,μ, tan β,mA(    x). When λ is small enough (say λ  ≤  0.1) the experimental constraints on the SUSY parameters obtained in the minimal SUSY model remain valid in the the NMSSM. If tan β  ≤  2.5 the predominant part of the NMSSM parameter space is excluded by unsuccessful Higgs searches. Non-observation of charginos at LEPII restricts the effective μ-term from below: |μ|  ≥  90 - 100  . Combining these limits one gets a useful lower bound on mA at the tree level:

[formula]

Requirement of the validity of perturbation theory up to the high energy scales constrains the parameter space further. In order to prevent the appearance of Landau pole during the evolution of the Yukawa couplings from the electroweak scale to Grand Unification scale (MX) the value of λ has to be always smaller than 0.7 .

In the NMSSM with κ = 0 the mass of the lightest pseudoscalar vanishes. This is a manifestation of the enlarged SU(2)  ×  [U(1)]2 global symmetry of the Lagrangian. The extra U(1) (Peccei-Quinn) symmetry is spontaneously broken giving rise to a massless Goldstone boson (axion) [\cite=10]. The Peccei-Quinn symmetry and the axion allow one to avoid the strong CP problem, eliminating the θ-term in QCD [\cite=11]. At low energies the axion gains a small mass due to mixing with the pion. The mass of orthogonal superposition of P and PS is

[formula]

The lower bound on mA ([\ref=25]) leads to the hierarchical structure of the CP-even Higgs mass matrix. It can be written as

[formula]

where ε <  < 1. Indeed the top-left entry (M211 = A) of the corresponding 3  ×  3 mass matrix ([\ref=18]) is the largest one in the dominant part of parameter space. It is proportional to m2A while M212  ~  M222  ~  M233  ~  M2Z and M213  ~  mAMZ. Therefore the ratio MZ / mA plays the role of a small parameter ε.

The CP-even Higgs mass matrix can be reduced to block diagonal form:

[formula]

by virtue of unitary transformation

[formula]

The obtained matrix ([\ref=24]) is now easily diagonalized via a rotation by an angle θ of the two lowest states

[formula]

As a result we find the approximate formulae for the masses of the CP-even Higgs bosons

[formula]

Also using the explicit form of the unitary matrix [formula], that links H,h and N to the mass eigenstates, the approximate expressions for the couplings of the lightest Higgs particles to the Z-boson can be established:

[formula]

The approximate solutions for the CP-even Higgs boson masses and couplings shed light on their behaviour as the NMSSM parameters are varied. As evident from Eq.([\ref=244]), at large values of tan β or μ the mass-squared of the lightest Higgs scalar tends to be negative because M223 becomes large while bottom-right entry of the matrix ([\ref=24]) goes to zero. Due to the vacuum stability requirement, which implies the positivity of the mass-squared of all Higgs particles, the auxiliary variable x is localized near unity. At the tree level we get

[formula]

where m0A = 2μ  /   sin 2β. The allowed range of the auxiliary variable x is quite narrow (see [\cite=7]). According to the definition of mA ([\ref=14]) the tight bounds on x enforce mA to be confined in the vicinity of μ  tgβ which is considerably larger than the Z-boson mass. As a result the masses of the charged Higgs boson, heaviest CP-odd and CP-even Higgs states are rather close to mA. At the tree level the theoretical bounds on the masses of the lightest Higgs scalars are

[formula]

The masses of h2 and h1 are set by the Z-boson mass and λv respectively so that mh1,mh2  ≪  mA in the allowed range of the parameter space.

Soft breaking of the PQ-symmetry

Unfortunately searches for massless pseudoscalar and light scalar particles exclude any choice of the parameters in the NMSSM with κ = 0, unless one allows λ to become very small [\cite=12]. In order to get a reliable pattern for the Higgs masses and couplings the Peccei-Quinn symmetry must be broken. Recently different origins of extra U(1) symmetry breaking were discussed [\cite=13]-[\cite=131]. Here we assume that the violation of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is caused by non-zero value of κ. As follows from the explicit form of the mass matrices ([\ref=14]), ([\ref=16]) and ([\ref=18]) in this case the Higgs spectrum depends on six parameters at the tree level: λ,κ,μ,tgβ,Aκ and mA (or x). We restrict our consideration by small values of κ when the PQ-symmetry is only slightly broken. To be precise we consider such values of κ that do not change much the vacuum energy density. the last requirement places a strong bound on κ when λ goes to zero:

[formula]

If κ  ≫  λ2 then the terms κ2|S|4 and [formula] in the Higgs effective potential ([\ref=5]) becomes much larger |μ|4  ~  M4Z increasing the absolute value of the vacuum energy density significantly. A small ratio κ  /  λ may naturally arise from the renormalization group flow of λ and κ from MX to MZ [\cite=7] [\cite=14].

The soft breaking of the PQ-symmetry does not lead to the realignment of the Higgs spectrum preserving its mass hierarchy. Still M211 is the largest matrix element of the CP-even Higgs mass matrix in the admissible part of the NMSSM parameter space. Therefore the approximate formulae ([\ref=244])-([\ref=42]) obtained in the previous section remain valid in the considered limit. It is easy to see that the lightest CP-even Higgs states respect a sum rule

[formula]

The right-hand side of Eq.([\ref=37]) is almost insensitive to the choice of mA and rather weakly varies with changing tgβ. As a result of the sum rule ([\ref=37]) the second lightest Higgs scalar mass is maximized as mh1 goes to zero, and vice versa the lightest Higgs scalar gets maximal mass when mh2 attains minimum (see also Fig.1). According to Eq.([\ref=244]) the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson vary within the limits:

[formula]

The mass matrix of the CP-odd Higgs sector also exhibits the hierarchical structure. Indeed the entry 211 is determined by m2A whereas the off-diagonal element of the matrix ([\ref=14]) is of the order of λv  ·  mA. Since the ratio κ  /  λ is small, the other diagonal entry 222  ≪  m2A. this again permits one to seek the eigenvalues of the matrix ([\ref=14]) as an expansion in powers of λv / mA. The perturbation theory being applied for its diagonalization results in concise expressions for the squared masses of the Higgs pseudoscalars

[formula]

Because the PQ-symmetry is now broken the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson also gains non-zero mass. In compliance with Eq.([\ref=42]) the couplings of h1 and h2 to a Z-pair obey the following sum rule:

[formula]

while RZA11 and RZA12 are suppressed by a factor (λ2v2 / m2A).

At the tree level and large values of tgβ ([formula]) the approximate expressions ([\ref=244]) and ([\ref=39]) describing the masses of the Higgs scalar and pseudoscalar particles are simplified

[formula]

making their analysis more transparent. Again the positivity of the mass-squared of the lightest Higgs scalar restricts the allowed range of x

[formula]

if the PQ-symmetry is only slightly broken. When κ  ≪  λ2 the admissible interval of the auxiliary variable x shrinks drastically establishing a very stringent bound on the value of mA and strong correlation between mA, μ and tg  β (see [\cite=7], [\cite=131]) that constrains the masses of the heavy Higgs bosons mh3  ≈  mH±  ≈  mA2 in the vicinity of μ  tgβ.

The results of the numerical studies of the Higgs boson masses and their couplings including leading one-loop corrections from the top and stop loops are given in Fig.1-3. As a representative example we fix the Yukawa couplings at the Grand Unification scale so that λ(MX) = κ(MX) = 2ht(MX) = 1.6, that corresponds to tgβ  ≥  3, λ(Mt)≃0.6 and κ(Mt)≃0.36 at the electroweak scale. We set μ = 150   which is quite close to the current limit on μ in the MSSM. The parameter Aκ occurs in the right-hand side of the sum rule ([\ref=37]) and in the mass of the lightest pseudoscalar m2A1 with opposite sign. As a consequence whereas m2h1 rises over changing Aκ, m2A1 diminishes and vice versa. Too large positive and negative values of Aκ pull the mass-squared of either lightest scalar or pseudoscalar below zero destabilizing the vacuum that restricts Aκ from below and above. To represent the results of our numerical analysis the parameter Aκ is taken to be near the center of the admissible interval Aκ≃135  .

The one-loop Higgs masses of scalars (solid curve) and pseudoscalars (dashed-dotted curve) are confronted with the approximate solutions (dashed and dotted curves). Masses are in GeV.

In Fig.1-3 the masses of the neutral Higgs particles and their couplings to Z are examined as a function of mA. From the restrictions ([\ref=41]) on the parameter x and numerical results presented in Fig.1 it is evident that the requirement of the stability of the physical vacuum and the experimental constraints on μ and tgβ rules out low values of mA, maintaining mass hierarchy whilst κ  ≤  λ2. The lightest Higgs scalar and pseudoscalar can be heavy enough to escape their production at LEP. Moreover as one can see from Fig.2 the lightest Higgs scalar can be predominantly a singlet field, making its detection more difficult than in the SM or MSSM. The lightest Higgs pseudoscalar is also singlet dominated, making its observation at future colliders quite problematic; the coupling of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson to a CP-odd Higgs bosons and a Z is always strongly suppressed (see Fig.3) according to ([\ref=42]). The hierarchical structure of the mass matrices ensures that the heaviest CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons are predominantly composed of H and P. As a result the coupling RZA23 is rather close to unity while RZZ3 is almost negligible. In Fig.1-3 the approximate solutions ([\ref=244])-([\ref=42]) are also given. They work remarkably well.

Conclusions

In the present article we have obtained the approximate solutions for the Higgs masses and couplings in the NMSSM with exact and softly broken PQ-symmetry which describe the numerical solutions with high accuracy. The approximate formulae ([\ref=244])-([\ref=42]) provide nice insight into mass hierarchies in the considered model. The vacuum stability requirements and LEP restrictions on the NMSSM parameters leads to the splitting in the spectrum of the Higgs bosons. When κ = 0 or κ  ≤  λ2 the charged Higgs states, the heaviest scalar and pseudoscalar are nearly degenerate around mA  ~  μ  tgβ. The masses of new scalar and pseudoscalar states, which are predominantly singlet fields, are governed by the combination of parameters [formula]. In the NMSSM with exact and softly broken PQ-symmetry they are considerably lighter than the heaviest Higgs states. Decreasing κ pushes their masses down so that they can be even the lightest particles in the Higgs boson spectrum. The SM like Higgs boson has a mass around 130  . We have established useful sum rules for the masses of the lightest Higgs scalars and their couplings to a Z pair. Also we found that the couplings of the lightest CP-even Higgs states to the lightest pseudoscalar and Z-boson are suppressed. Observing two light scalar and one pseudoscalar Higgs particles but no charged Higgs boson, at future colliders would present an opportunity to distinguish the NMSSM with softly broken PQ-symmetry from the MSSM even if the heavy states are inaccessible.
