Recurrence relations for the Lerch Φ function and applications

Introduction

In recent years the properties of the Riemann Zeta function for positive integer values of its argument have received a lot of attention. Rapidly convergent series representation such as Euler's well-known one

[formula]

have been recently discovered by several authors in many different ways (see [\cite=Sri_Taiwan2000] for an exhaustive overview).

In this contest, H.M Srivastava, M.L. Glasser e V. S. Adamchick ([\cite=SriGlaAdam2000]) found some interesting series representations of the values ζ(2n + 1), [formula], studying different possible evaluations of the definite integral

[formula]

At the end of their article, the authors demonstrate that every representation they found can be derived from the following unification formula

[formula]

This paper presents a very simple method for deriving some recurrence relations and shows how it can be used as a short cut to obtain two formulas that generalize equation ([\ref=EquSriv]). The usefulness of the obtained results is then shown by deducting in a simple and unified way many known (or equivalent to known) evaluations and series representations for the Riemann Zeta function and the Dirichlet Beta function.

Notations

This section presents the notation used in the next sections. The Euler Gamma function Γ(s) is defined as the analytic continuation of the integral

[formula]

and, for [formula], satisfies the property Γ(n + 1) = n! The Hurwitz Zeta function ζ(s,b) is defined as the analytic continuation of the following series (defined for [formula] and [formula])

[formula]

and it reduces to the Riemann Zeta function ζ(s) in the case b = 1. Similarly, the Dirichlet Beta function β(s) is the analytic continuation of the series

[formula]

For [formula] with [formula], taken [formula] satisfying [formula] if a = 1 and [formula] if [formula], the Polylogarithm function is defined by and the Lerch Φ function is defined, for [formula], by Furthermore we use Bernoulli polynomials Bk(x) defined by

[formula]

and Euler polynomials Ek(x) defined by

[formula]

The Bk(0) values, called Bernoulli numbers, are represented as Bk, while Euler numbers are the 2kEk(1 / 2) values, represented as Ek. Two important (and well known) results that relate Bernoulli and Euler numbers with the values ζ(2k) and β(2k + 1), where [formula], are the following relations ([\cite=handbook])

[formula]

[formula]

Finally, the basic notions of complex variable analysis will be used.

Holomorphic functions in a strip

Let α and β be positive real numbers and let f(z) be an holomorphic function in the strip [formula] such that f(z) = O(zν), where ν < 0, if [formula]. Then the following equality holds

[formula]

Given φ∈( - α,β), take [formula], with R > 0, and consider de rectangular contour C of vertices 0, R, R + iφ and iφ. For Cauchy theorem the integral of f over C must be null; taking the limit for R  →    ∞  , the integral over the right vertical side tends to zero and, parameterizing the integrals over the other three sides, we have ([\ref=ident:funol]).

Given a function g(z), M(g)(z) is its Mellin transform, that is

[formula]

for those values of z for which the integral exists. Furthermore, we indicate with gφ(z) its translated of a value iφ in the domain, that is

[formula]

Let α and β be positive real numbers and let g(z) be an holomorphic function in the strip [formula] such that g(z) = o(z- k), for all [formula] if [formula]. Then, for every integer n  ≥  0 Moreover, if g(z) is not holomorphic in z = 0, having a pole of order p, the equality holds for every n  ≥  p.

Let us consider f(z) defined as

[formula]

where n is chosen as specified in the above Proposition. Then f(z) satisfies the hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=teo:funol] and, in view of ([\ref=def:gphitrasl]),

[formula]

For the binomial theorem, we have

[formula]

Substituting in ([\ref=ident:funol]), in view of ([\ref=def:mellintrasf]), noting that the Mellin transforms are well defined, we obtain ([\ref=ident:funolmelpot]).

Recurrence relations for the Lerch Φ function

An important transform

Given [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], let us consider the function of the complex variable t

[formula]

Its Mellin transform (as defined in ([\ref=def:mellintrasf])) is

[formula]

We note that the integral exists if [formula] when a = 1 and if [formula] in the other cases. We can write

[formula]

so that we have (cf. for ex. [\cite=SriChoi2001])

Lerch Φ and Bernoulli polynomials series

Referring to equation ([\ref=ident:funolmelpot]) let us consider, for [formula] with [formula], the function of the complex variable z

[formula]

for which we have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ident:PhiMel]), considering that Φ(1,s,b) = ζ(s,b), we easily find that, for [formula], M(g)(n + 1) = n!  ζ(n + 1,b) and, for [formula] and 0 < |φ| < 2π, M(gφ)(k + 1) = e- ibφk!  Φ(e- iφ,k + 1,b). Furthermore, from ([\ref=def:PolBern]) we have

[formula]

So that ([\ref=ident:funolmelpot]) becomes (multiplying both sides by (iφ)- n)

Some applications of this result, as well as its connection with ([\ref=EquSriv]), will be discussed in section [\ref=applic].

Lerch Φ and Euler polynomials series

Let us now consider, for [formula], the function of the complex variable z

[formula]

so that we have

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=ident:PhiMel]), for n  ≥  0, M(g)(n + 1) = n!  Φ(  -  1,n  +  1,b) and, for [formula] and |φ| < π, M(gφ)(k + 1) = e- ibφk!  Φ( - e- iφ,k + 1,b). Moreover, from ([\ref=def:PolEul]) we have

[formula]

Substituting in ([\ref=ident:funolmelpot]) and multiplying both sides by (iφ)- n we obtain

Applications of ([\ref=ident:variamiameno])

Deduction of ([\ref=EquSriv])

Suppose b = 1 in ([\ref=ident:variamiameno]); it can be easily shown that ζ(n,1) = ζ(n) and, if [formula] and 0 < |φ| < 2π, Φ(e- iφ,k + 1,1) = eiφ  k + 1(e- iφ). So, equation ([\ref=ident:variamiameno]) reduces to Moreover, it is well known (see [\cite=handbook]) that B1 =  - 1 / 2, B2k + 1 = 0 for k > 0 and, if φ  ≠  0, 1(e- iφ) =  -  log (1 - e- iφ).

Thus, taking φ =  - 2π  /  ω, equation ([\ref=ident:equasri01]) becomes Using ([\ref=ident:zetanumbern]) to express B2k in terms of ζ(2k), multiplying by - 1 / 2 and rearranging terms, we obtain

[formula]

which is ([\ref=EquSriv]) (and thus [\cite=SriGlaAdam2000]) with the correction of the index of the PolyLogarithm.

As explained by the authors in [\cite=SriGlaAdam2000], equation ([\ref=EquSrivcor]) can be used to obtain several series representation for the ζ for odd integer values of its arguments. Some interesting examples, obtained for ω = 2, are ([\cite=SriGlaAdam2000])

[formula]

[formula]

Combining these two equations we have ([\cite=ChenSri1998] and [\cite=Sri2000a])

[formula]

and

[formula]

On the other hand, when ω = 4, more interesting results can be obtained. It is easy to see that

[formula]

Substituting in ([\ref=EquSrivcor]), taking the real part of both sides (paying attention on the parity of n) it is possible to obtain the following results (calculations are omitted for brevity)

[formula]

and

[formula]

which are equivalent to [\cite=SriGlaAdam2000] but where we have isolated the β function terms (which corresponds to express the Clausen's functions of [\cite=SriGlaAdam2000], when ω = 4, in terms of the β function instead of using [\cite=SriGlaAdam2000]).

If, in ([\ref=ident:bordel1]), n = 0, we have ([\cite=SriGlaAdam2000])

[formula]

and substituting this representation in ([\ref=ident:bordel2]) with n = 1

[formula]

The formula ([\ref=Z34k]) is essentially the same as a known result [\cite=ChenSri1998]. Applying alternatively ([\ref=ident:bordel1]) and ([\ref=ident:bordel2]) with increasing values of n and using the representations found at every step we have

[formula]

[formula]

and so on.

Another application: case b=1/2

We present here another possible use of equation ([\ref=ident:variamiameno]) when b = 1 / 2 and φ  =  π. It is easy to verify that ζ(n,1 / 2) = (2n - 1)ζ(n) and, if k  ≥  0, Φ(e- iπ,k + 1,1 / 2) = 2k + 1β(k + 1). It is also easy to demonstrate that Bk(1 / 2)  =  (21 - k - 1)Bk; thus equation ([\ref=ident:variamiameno]) reduces to and using ([\ref=ident:zetanumbern]) we have

This equation allows us to obtain some relations; taking the imaginary part of both side we have the following two formulas

[formula]

which, in view of ([\ref=ident:zetanumbern]) and ([\ref=ident:betanumeul]), show to be equivalent to (cf. for ex. [\cite=SriChoi2001])

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively (or, viceversa, known ([\ref=ident:numeulrecurel]) and ([\ref=ident:numbercombnumeul]), ([\ref=ident:betarecurel]) and ([\ref=ident:zetacombeta]) are equivalent to ([\ref=ident:zetanumbern]) and ([\ref=ident:betanumeul])).

Now, taking the real part of both sides of ([\ref=ident:convarmiameno]) we have

[formula]

From equation ([\ref=ident:betaserepr]), some interesting series representations for β(2m), [formula] can be derived. When n = 0, for example, we have

[formula]

which can also be obtained by combining [formula] and the known (see [\cite=Sri_Taiwan2000], eq. 4.11, pg. 586) sum ([\ref=sumzetalog2]), while for n = 1 we have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ident:zetaserepr]), similar series representations for the values ζ(2m + 1) [formula] can be obtained, for example

[formula]

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=beta(2)]), the formula ([\ref=Z(3)]) is equivalent to a known result [\cite=ChenSri1998].

Applications of ([\ref=ident:variamiapiu])

Series of β: companion of ([\ref=EquSrivcor])

From equation ([\ref=ident:variamiapiu]), if b = 1 / 2, a companion of equation ([\ref=EquSrivcor]) can be derived, in which the rule of the ζ function is played by the β function. It is easy to see that Φ( - 1,n + 1,1 / 2) = 2n + 1β(n + 1). Now, taking φ =  - π  /  ω, using ([\ref=ident:betanumeul]) and remembering that Ek = 2kEk(1 / 2), we can rewrite the right hand side of ([\ref=ident:variamiapiu]) as

[formula]

where we have used the fact that E2k + 1 = 0. Thus, multiplying both sides by - 1 / 2, equation ([\ref=ident:variamiapiu]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Case ω =  - 2 and Dirichlet L-series

As an example of application of equation ([\ref=Equsrivvar]), let us set ω =  - 2 so that, multiplying both sides for - 2, the left hand side becomes

[formula]

With some further calculations, it is possible to demonstrate that for every s > 1

[formula]

so that we have

[formula]

where χ1 and χ2 are characters on [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Considering the convergence of the L-series, we can say that equation ([\ref=ident:phiLseries]) holds for every integer s = k with [formula]. As a result, equation ([\ref=Equsrivvar]) becomes

[formula]

Taking the imaginary part of both sides we have the following two relations (see [\cite=SriTsu2001] for interesting more general, but not equivalent, recursions and series representation for Dirichlet L-series)

[formula]

[formula]

If, for example, on equation ([\ref=ident:bordelL01]), n = 0, we have

[formula]

On the other hand one may verify that

[formula]

so that, writing the cosines in exponential form, we can sum the series to obtain [formula]. This gives us the result

[formula]

which is an interesting (presumably new) counterpart of the known sum ([\cite=Sri_Taiwan2000], eq. 4.11, pg. 586)

[formula]

These examples show some possible uses of equations ([\ref=ident:variamiameno]) and ([\ref=ident:variamiapiu]), and it is clear that other chooses of the parameters b and φ will give more complicated, but maybe interesting, equalities and recurrence relations.

Reflection properties

It is well known that Bernoulli and Euler polynomials satisfy the property

[formula]

and

[formula]

So, called S1(n,φ,b) the left hand side of ([\ref=ident:variamiameno]), we have and, called S2(n,φ,b) the left hand side of ([\ref=ident:variamiapiu]), we have We have found a relation between the values Φ(eiφ,k,b) and Φ(eiφ,k,1 - b), [formula], that does not include any infinite sum.
