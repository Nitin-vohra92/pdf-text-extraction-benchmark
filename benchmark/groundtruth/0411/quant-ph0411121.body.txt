Excited Field of Particle in Quantum Theory

Introduction

Quantum Mechanics(QM) is one of the pillars of modern physics and supported by a lot of precise experiment data. But, after one century, the basic concept of QM, wave-particle duality is still unclarified. The strangeness is, in Young's double slit experiment, a photon has to go through both slits at the same time to give interference pattern. To solve wave-particle duality, a series of experiments were done, in which, the most important one is the "Which way" experiment in an atom interferometer which was proposed by Scully et al[\cite=scully], and successfully realized by DNR[\cite=dnr]. In spite of trying to solve wave-particle duality experimentally, we try to construct a more fundamental model which can give wave-particle duality clearly and directly and be consistent with Quantum Theory. Since to a particle there is wave-particle duality, instead of made up by only field in Standard Quantum Theory, we treat a particle as two parts, a point charge and its excited field, where we assume all the interaction and energy-momentum of the particle are taken by the excited field but not the point charge(because of this, the point charge will disappear in Lagrangian of particle and it is impossible for us to detect the position of the point charge, we will show this in Sec.2). Before we begin to construct the model, we first discuss this assumption is reasonable. In Classical Electromagnetic Theory, when we calculate the force between two rest electrons A and B, we first calculate the electric field excited by electron A,

[formula]

and the force between the two electrons is

[formula]

where [formula] is the amplitude of excited electric field of electron A at the point of electron B. From the the right hand of equation (2), we can see that its the excited electric field of electron A which interacts with electron B. In other word, if we treat the electron A as a system, including a point charge and its excited electric field, only the excited electric field interacts with electron B. On the other hand, we know electric field takes energy, and electron B can also excite electric field, so we can calculate the total energy of excited electric fields [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

where R is distance between the two electrons, and C is constant

[formula]

We can calculate the gradient of energy W to get the force

[formula]

It's consistent with Coulomb's law. We can see that the interaction of two "rest" electrons could be totally expressed by the interaction of their excited electric fields

[formula]

And from equation (3) ,(4) and (5) , the total energy(except the mass which we will talk in Sec.2) of the two rest electrons are also taken by their excited electric fields, but not the point charge. Here we have discussed that in Classical Electromagnetic Theory, the interaction and energy of two rest electrons are taken by their excited fields. Furthermore, we expect that, to a physical particle (we separate it into two parts, a point charge and its excited field), all interaction and energy-momentum are taken by its excited field. Based on this argument, we can derive the Lagrangian of excited field of a particle, and we will see it is consistent with Quantum Theory. We can see, in this model, wave particle duality is obvious, the point charge is particle like and the excited field is wave like.

Model of Excited Field

In this section, we construct model of excited field of a vector particle, Scalar particle and Spinor particle, and we found its Lagrangian is consistent with Standard Quantum Theory. Since a particle has wave-particle duality character, instead of made up by only field, we treat a particle is made up by two parts, a point charge and its excited field, and we assume all the interaction and energy-momentum are taken by the excited field, as argued in previous section. Recall that in Classical Electromagnetic Theory, a current of an electron charge can excite electromagnetic potential

[formula]

[formula]

where jμ  =  ρ0Uμ, [formula] is rest electron charge density, Uμ is four velocity. and the Lagrangian is

[formula]

To a photon, in our model, is made up by two parts, a point charge eB and its excited field Bμ. Since photon is vector particle, the excited field Bμ excited by eB should be vector field, compared with (7), the equation of excited vector field Bμ should be

[formula]

[formula]

so, in our model, the Lagrangian of a free photon particle is

[formula]

where [formula].

We have to be very careful here. Different with Standard Quantum Theory, in Lagrangian (12), there is no - eBjμBμ term, and to a free photon particle, the Lagrangian is simply [formula]. While in our model, a particle is made up by point charge eB and excited field Bμ, the term - eBjμBμ is required to excite vector field Bμ.

We can write Bμ(x) as

[formula]

where B+  μ(x) is positive frequency part and B-  μ(x) are negative frequency part.

In quantum field theory, causality requires particle and antiparticle have opposite quantum number[\cite=peskin], and only the net excess of particle or antiparticle is observable.[\cite=s&ab]. While the positive frequency field is corresponding to particle and negative frequency field is corresponding to antiparticle, so the positive frequency field and negative frequency field have opposite quantum number and only the net excess of positive frequency field or negative frequency field is observable, in other word, only the difference of positive frequency and negative frequency field can appear in the Lagrangian of interaction. We can write the Lagrangian of interaction as

[formula]

where f(B+  μ - B-  μ,∂(B +   μ  -  B -   μ)) is general function of (B+  μ - B-  μ) and its derivative, V(x) is other fields interacting with B+  μ and B-  μ. The exact form of f(B+  μ - B-  μ,∂(B +   μ  -  B -   μ)) and V(X) are given by gauge symmetry[\cite=gauge], here we don't talk about this point.

The total Lagrangian becomes

[formula]

Define [formula], then the Lagrangian becomes

[formula]

Aμ = B+  μ - B-  μ and Bμ = B+  μ + B-  μ, they are linear independent. But from (16), their is no energy and momentum term of Aμ. Since both Aμ and Bμ are vector fields, they should have same form of energy and momentum , so the Lagrangian is

[formula]

where

[formula]

We can see the first line of (17) is just the Lagrangian of Maxwell field which interacts with other fields V(x). But now, |Aμ(x)|2 is not the amplitude of possibility of a photon at point x any more. Aμ(x) is B+  μ(x) - B-  μ(x), where B+  μ(x) and B-  μ(x) are positive and negative frequency part of excited field of a point charge. From the second line of (17), we can see the field Abμ(x) doesn't interact with any field( as for eBjμ, the current of point charge, there is no interaction and energy-momentum, since all the interaction and energy-momentum are taken by its excited fields B+  μ(x) and B-  μ(x) , as assumed and argued in Sec.1). So if at initial time the energy and momentum of Abμ(x) is zero, [formula], at any later time, the energy-momentum of Abμ(x) is also zero, [formula]. If at initial time, the energy and momentum of Abμ is not zero, at later time, if Aμ interacts with other field, its momentum will change. But the momentum of Abμ cannot change, Aμ and Abμ will be separated. We know Aμ(x) is B+  μ(x) - B-  μ(x) and Abμ(x) is B+  μ(x) + B-  μ(x), where B+  μ(x) and B-  μ(x) are two parts of excited field of a point charge eB, Aμ and Abμ have to be together, so the energy and momentum of Abμ must be zero. We can drop the second line of (17) into background and what is left is

[formula]

this is consistent with Quantum Field Theory.(the exact form of f(Aμ,∂Aμ) and V(x) is given by gauge symmetry[\cite=gauge])

Wave-particle duality appears at Lagrangian (17) clearly and directly. The point charge eB is particle like and the difference of positive and negative frequency of its excited field, Aμ is wave like. But since eBjμ, except of exciting field Bμ, doesn't interact with any field, it is impossible for us to detect its position. In "Which way" experiment[\cite=scully], according to our model, even we can tell which slit the photon goes through, the interference pattern is possibly not destroyed. In our model, both photon field Aμ(x) and electromagnetic potential Aμ(x) in classical electromagnetic theory are excited by a source. Electromagnetic potential is excited by electron field, and photon field is excited by a point charge. So |Aμ(x)|2 doesn't mean the possibility of a photon appears at position x, as statistical interpretation.[\cite=interpretation]

After constructing a model of a photon, we begin to construct models of scalar particle and spinor particle. We know an electron charge density can excite scalar potential

[formula]

[formula]

but obviously, φ is not Lorentz invariant. To get an equation of excited scalar field, we have to rewrite equation (17) to be Lorentz invariant,

[formula]

where φ is a scalar field, ê is the charge to excite φ, and ρ0 is Lorentz invariant charge "density", or scalar charge density, we can write it as

[formula]

To a point charge eφ of a scalar particle and its excited scalar field φB(x) where we separate φB(x) into positive frequency part φ+(x) and negative frequency part φ-(x), as same argument as Maxwell field, we can write the Lagrangian as

[formula]

where f(φ+  -  φ-,∂(φ +    -   φ - )) is general function of φ+  -  φ- and its derivative, V(x) is other fields which interacts with φ+ and φ-. Define [formula] and put the energy-momentum term of φ, then the Lagrangian is

[formula]

where the first line of (22) is just the Lagrangian of scalar field in QFT.

If φ interacts with Higgs field, then φ could be massive scalar field, the Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

where m is the mass of φ. Since φ is massive but φb is massless(φB cannot interact with any field, including Higgs field), at the rest frame of φ, the energy and momentum of φB is zero, so at any frame, the energy-momentum of φB is zero. Dropping the second line of (23) into background( the energy and momentum of ρ0 is also zero, as argued in Sec.1), what is left is

[formula]

which is just the Lagrangian of massive scalar field in Quantum Field Theory.

Compared with equation (7) and (20), the equation of excited spinor field should be like

[formula]

where Λ is a spinor number and Λ̄Λ = 1, [formula], êψ is the charge to excite field ψ. Define that

[formula]

[formula]

the Lagrangian is

[formula]

To a point charge eψ of a spinor particle and its excited spinor field ψB, where we separate ψB(x) into two parts, positive frequency ψ+(x) and negative frequency ψ-(x), we can write the Lagrangian as

[formula]

where

[formula]

and f(ψ+  -  ψ-,+  -  -,∂(ψ+  -  ψ-),∂(+  -  -)) is general function of (ψ+  -  ψ-),(+  -  -) and their derivatives. Here we don't write down the energy and momentum term of gψ(x) because it is not a real field, and all energy momentum is taken by the excited field ψ+(x) and ψ-(x) of point charge eψ.

Define ψ  =  ψ+  -  ψ- and put the energy and momentum term of ψ, then the Lagrangian becomes

[formula]

Dropping the second line of (31) and its H.C into background, as argued as in (17) and (23), then we get

[formula]

which is as same as the Lagrangian of spinor field in QFT.

If ψ interacts with Higgs field, then ψ could be massive spinor field

[formula]

So electron field ψ can also be treated as the difference of positive frequency and negative frequency part of excited field of a point charge. We get such picture: a point charge eψ excites a field ψB, and we separate it into two parts: positive frequency part ψ+ and negative frequency part ψ-, but we found, all the interaction and energy-momentum are taken by the difference of two parts of excited field,ψ  =  ψ+  -  ψ-, or electron field, so we can only "see" the electron field, as for the sum of the two parts of excited field ψB and the point charge eψ, they just "disappeared". In other hand, electron field can excite electric field. But the scale of excited electric field is much bigger than the electron field, so in Classical Electromagnetic Theory, we can treat the electron field as a "point charge".

Discussion and Conclusion

We have discussed a model of excited field of particle. In this model, to a particle, there is two parts, a point charge and its excited field. And in this this model, wave particle duality is very clearly, point charge is particle like and excited field is wave like. But, as seen in Lagrangian (17),(23) and (31), the Lagrangian of point charge can be dropped into background, and it is impossible to detect its position. After dropping background , we get Lagrangian (18),(24) and (32), and they are consistent with QFT. But now, to a field χ(x), |χ(x)|2 doesn't mean the amplitude of possibility of a particle appearing at point x. χ(x) is just present the difference of positive and negative frequency part of excited field by a point charge (or current). So we get same Lagrangian(if we drop the background) as QFT, but the interpretation are totally different. If this model is correct, then we have to reconsider some parts of quantum physics, especially string theory . The main difference of this model and standard Quantum Theory in Lagrangian is that there is unusual background, as shown in (17), (23) and (32). With more study about this background, possibly we can testify this model in experiment. We have to mention that based on the argument that both interaction and energy-momentum of a particle are taken by its excited fields, the model we've discussed is not unique to satisfy Quantum Theory.
