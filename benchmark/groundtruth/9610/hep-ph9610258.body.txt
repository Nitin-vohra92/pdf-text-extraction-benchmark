Introduction

Despite that the Standard Model (SM) describes very successfully all the experimental data within the range of energies available today, it has many unsolved problems, such as the problem of mass, CP violation and the number of generations, etc., and the failure of the unification of electroweak and strong forces. For this reason one would expect that a more fundamental theory should exist, which describes the three forces within the context of a single group. Recent LEP data shows that this indeed can be achieved in Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories [\cite=R1] .

It is well known that the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) predicts the existence of many new particles (supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles) and the Higgs sector of the theory contains two Higgs doublets in order to give mass to the up and down quarks [\cite=R2]. The physical Higgs spectrum of the MSSM is richer than the SM and contains two CP-even and one CP-odd neutral Higgs bosons and a charged Higgs boson [\cite=R3]. The MSSM extension of the SM leads to clear and distinct experimental signatures especially in the Higgs sector. The search for the Higgs sector of the MSSM constitutes one of the main research fields in the existing and future accelerators to which theoretical physicists focus their attention. A lot of theoretical work in the literature has been devoted to the production and decay channels of Higgs particles, in particular the pseudoscalar neutral Higgs-boson A0, in various reactions (see for example [\cite=R4] and references therein). Here in this work, we investigate the production of the A0 in the polarized γe beams, namely in the process γe  →  eA0, at the center of mass energies [formula] and [formula]. Note that production of the A0 without polarization in γe beams, is studied in [\cite=R5]. However, the numerical results presented in that work, for the cross-sections of the the unpolarized beams, are over estimated and approximately 20 times larger than ours.

The paper is organized as follows. In sect.2 we calculate the cross-section for A0 production. We present our numerical results and give a discussion about them in sect.3.

Calculation of the Cross-Section γe  →  eA0 process

The process γe  →  eA0 is described by two type of diagrams: box and triangle diagrams. From quite a number of diagrams, however, the main contributions arise from triangle ones with photon exchange. This is clear from the fact that, the photon pole diagrams give the dominant contributions since t = 0 is in the physical region. Contributions of the triangle diagrams with Z-boson exchange and box diagrams give negligible contributions than that of photon exchange diagrams, since these diagrams are non-singular at t = 0. Therefore these contributions are all disregarded in this present work. On the other hand since the SUSY extension of the SM is considered, the charged chargino contributions are included.

The amplitude for the pseudoscalar A0 production in the γe  →  eA0 process can be written as

[formula]

Here p2 and p1 are the momenta of the final and initial electrons, respectively, k1 and ε are the photon momentum and polarization, t =  - (p1 - p2)2, and the loop factor F(t) is given as,

[formula]

where, NC = 3 is the color factor, Qt = 2 / 3 and Qb =  - 1 / 3 are the electric charge of the top and bottom quarks, m1 and m2 are the chargino masses and tan(β) is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs Doublets (see for example [\cite=R3]). The chargino coupling constants g11 and g22 depend on the elements of the 2  ×  2 unitary matrices U and V, that appear in diagonalization of the chargino mass matrix [\cite=R2]:

[formula]

where, M and μ are the symmetry breaking terms. Following [\cite=R5], we also consider two different cases: Mμ > m2Wsin(2β) (case-1) and Mμ < m2Wsin(2β) (case-2), for which

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. In further analysis we will take m1 > m2.

The scalar function C0 entering in (2) is given as (since in the present case one of the external particles is a photon),

[formula]

where,

[formula]

Using eq.(1) and performing summation over final electron spin and taking into account the polarization of the initial particle for the cross-section, we get

[formula]

where,

[formula]

Here we take s =  - (p1 + k1)2, u =  - (p2 - k1)2, and λ and ξ2 are the longitudinal polarization of the electron and circular polarization of the photon, respectively. From eq.(8) it follows that the expression for the differential cross-section contains the [formula] term and therefore in order to obtain the total cross-section for the subprocess, one must introduce a convenient cut-off parameter in the lower bound of the integration, namely, either the the mass of the electron or the cut-off parameter for the angle. By imposing the angular cut-off, i.e., [formula] the expression for the total cross-section takes the following form (see also [\cite=R5]):

[formula]

where,  = xs and x is the momentum fraction of the electron carried out by the photon. Explicit calculations show that, the contribution of the Z0 exchange diagram to the total cross-section is negligible than that of the photon exchange diagram.

It is well known that the high energy e+e- colliders can be converted into high energy γe colliders with the help of the back-scattered laser beams [\cite=R6]. So, taking into consideration the distribution function of the back-scattered photons, the total cross-section for the γe  →  eA0 process can be calculated by

[formula]

where, σ(sx) is given by eq.(10), the explicit form of the distribution function is [\cite=R6]

[formula]

where,

[formula]

In our numerical calculations we take ξ = 4.83.

Numerical Analysis

We present our numerical results for the cross-sections for various values of tan(β) in a series of graphs. The dependence of the cross-section on mA0 at different values of the circular polarization ξ2 of the photon is presented in Fig.1 and Fig.2 for case-1 at [formula] and [formula], respectively. A similar graphical analysis is illustrated for case-2 in Fig.3 and Fig.4. In the numerical calculations, for the largest chargino mass we take m1 = 250 ~ GeV and for m2 we take the largest value consistent with the restriction [formula], where upper and lower signs correspond to case-1 and case-2, respectively. Such restrictions are needed in order to ensure that M and μ are real. The choice we made for m1 and m2 in this article, is within the range of the chargino masses that are found in the SUSY theories. Further, we checked for the contribution coming from t, b, τ and charginos separately. Our calculations show that, for larger values of tan(β) the contributions arising from τ lepton and charginos become important.

Our starting point is the analysis of case-2. For tan(β) = 1, the cross-section decreases with increasing values of mA0 and around mA0≃mt, it reaches a deep minimum value, which from that point on it starts increasing and attains its maximum value at mA0≃2mt, and then decreases smoothly again. For larger values of tan(β) (i.e., for tan(β) = 5, ~ 20 and 50), the behavior of the cross-section is absolutely different and it gets its first maximum value around mA0≃mt, contrary to the previous case. The second maximum point is again around mA0≃2mt. Note that, at [formula], around the point mA0≃500 ~ GeV, a new maximum value for the cross-section shows itself, which is totally absent in the [formula] case. It is interesting to observe that, the locations of the maximum values of the cross-section are all independent of tan(β). Similar situation holds for all other values ξ2 of the circular polarization of the photon. The different behavior of the cross-section for the small and large values of tan(β) is due to the increase in the contributions arising from the τ-lepton and charginos.

Similar arguments hold for case-1 as well, but with the following differences: For almost all values of tan(β) the cross-section has its maximum value located around the same point mA0≃mt, while for tan(β) = 20 and tan(β) = 50 it has a minimum around the point mA0≃150 ~ GeV.

For all cases the maximum value of the cross-section is about ~  0.1fb. If we assume that the integral luminosity at [formula] is 10 ~ fb- 1 and at [formula] is 60 ~ fb- 1 [\cite=R6], we have at most 2 events for [formula] and 12 events for [formula].

From the analysis of all graphs, we can deduce the following result: For the detection of A0, the tan(β) = 1 case is more preferable. At [formula] , when g11 =  - g22 (g11 = g22), it seems that it is possible to detect A0 with a mass around mA0≃mt (mA0≃2mt). Similar situation is present for [formula], but with one important difference. For the case g11 =  - g22 at tan(β) = 1, it is possible to detect A0 with a mass around mA0≃mt and mA0≃2mt. Note that for this value of the tan(β), the cross-section for the case g11 =  - g22, is larger than that of g11 = g22.

Few words about the possibility of detecting A0 in experiments should be mentioned. In order to detect A0 in real experiments, we must take the decay products of A0 into account and separate the background processes from the signal of the A0 decay with the same final state particles. The main decay channels of A0 are [\cite=R4] [\cite=R7] : A0  →  b, c, t, τ+τ-, W±W∓, Zh, ZH, gg, γγ and Zγ. If mA0  ≤  2mt, in the minimal supersymmetric models the dominant decay mode of A0 is A0  →  b (for more detail see [\cite=R4]). This decay mode is dominant even above the top quark threshold up to tan β≃30 [\cite=R8]. In this case we can also neglect the chargino contributions since they are smaller than the one arising from b mode (see [\cite=R4]). Therefore, in our case the main process which is responsible for detecting A0 is γe  →  eA0  →  eb with a branching ratio of Br(A0  →  b)≃0.95 [\cite=R4]. It is clear that in this case the main background process is the direct b production in γe  →  eb (see [\cite=R5]). A comparison of our results on cross-section and the background process γe  →  eb [\cite=R5] leads to the conclusion that at [formula] the background process dominates for all values of tan β. On the other hand at [formula], and tan β  =  1 the b signal from A0 can be detected with a mass mA0≃2mt.

Finally we would like to discuss the following question: Can we deduce any extra information about the mass of A0, if we investigate the polarization asymmetry due to the longitudinal and circular polarization of the initial electron and photon, respectively? In order to answer this question, we presented in Fig.(5) the behavior of polarization asymmetry versus [formula] at different values of mA0. We clearly observe that when mA0≃mt polarization asymmetry approaches to zero around [formula], and this value of energy is far from the maximum available energy range of the present colliders. Moreover, it follows from this figure that, the dependence of polarization asymmetry on [formula] at different values of mA0, is practically the same. Therefore, in our opinion, the polarization asymmetry is not a convenient tool for deducing extra information about the mass of A0.

Our final conclusion is that, in search of the pseudo-scalar A0 in γe collider, with the preferred choice of tan(β) = 1, it is possible to detect the pseudoscalar A0 with a mass of mA0≃2mt.
