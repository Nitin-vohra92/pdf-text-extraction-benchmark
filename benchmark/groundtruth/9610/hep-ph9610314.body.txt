Abstract

The problem of the "strangeness" of nucleon is a very important theoretical and experimental issue (see, for example, Ref.[\cite=Anselmino]). The data obtained in the recent CERN [\cite=CERN] and SLAC [\cite=SLAC] experiments on deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons on polarized nucleons are in agreement with the data of EMC collaboration [\cite=EMC]. From the analysis of these data it follows that the one-nucleon matrix elements of the axial strange current is relatively large and comparable with the matrix elements of axial u and d currents. In a recent analysis of the data [\cite=Ellis-Karliner] it was found that

[formula]

where the constants Δq (with q = u,d,s) are determined by

[formula]

Here M is the nucleon mass and [formula] is the state vector of a nucleon with momentum p and projection of the spin on the direction sα equal to r.

As it is well known, in order to determine the constants Δq from the data on polarized deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering it is necessary extrapolate the polarized structure function g1 to the point x = 0. Usually, a Regge behaviour of the function g1 is assumed. The value of the constant F / D that is also used in order to determine the constants Δq is obtained from the data on the leptonic decays of hyperons under the assumption that the effects of violation of SU(3) can be neglected. Both these assumption require further investigation (see, for example, Ref.[\cite=Cheng96]).

Alternative methods that could allow to determine the matrix elements of the strange currents are obviously necessary. It is well known (see Ref.[\cite=Kaplan-Manohar]) that NC-induced processes could be important sources of information on the matrix elements of the axial and vector strange currents.

The neutral current of the Standard Model in the u, d and s approximation has the form

[formula]

where v3α and a3α are the third components of the isovector vector and axial currents, [formula] is the electromagnetic current and

[formula]

are the vector and axial strange currents.

Using Eq.([\ref=03]) we can connect the matrix elements of the strange currents with the quantities that can be measured with the investigation of NC, CC and electromagnetic processes. This will be our main strategy.

There are two types of NC-induced effects:

P-odd effects in lepton-nucleon scattering;

NC neutrino-nucleon(nucleus) scattering.

P-odd effects in lepton-nucleon scattering are due to the interference of diagrams with γ and Z exchange. It is easy to see from general symmetry arguments that the contribution of the vector (axial) strange currents to the P-odd asymmetry is proportional to gV  =    -  1 / 2  +  2 sin 2θW (gA  =    -  1 / 2). Using the latest value of the parameter sin 2θW ( sin 2θW  =  0.226  ±  0.004 [\cite=PDG96]) we obtain gV≃  -  0.05. Thus, the investigation of P-odd effects in lepton-nucleon scattering could allow to obtain information only about the matrix elements of the strange vector current. On the other hand, in the cross sections of neutrino processes there is no any apriori suppression of the contributions of both axial and vector strange currents.

In Ref.[\cite=ABGM96] we have considered in detail the possibilities to extract information about the strange vector and axial nucleon form factors from the investigation of the elastic neutrino(antineutrino)-nucleon scattering processes

[formula]

We have shown that the strange magnetic GSM(Q2) and strange axial FSA(Q2) form factors are connected with asymmetry

[formula]

by the relation

[formula]

Here Vud is the ud element of the CKM matrix, G3M(Q2) = (GpM(Q2) - GnM(Q2)) / 2 is the isovector magnetic form factor of the nucleon, Gp(n)M(Q2) is the magnetic form factor of the proton (neutron), FA(Q2) is the CC axial form factor, FsA(Q2) and GsM(Q2) are axial and magnetic strange form factors. In Eq.([\ref=06]) the quantities [formula] and [formula] are the differential cross sections of the NC elastic processes ([\ref=05]), and [formula] and [formula] are the differential cross sections of the CC quasi-elastic processes

[formula]

The relation ([\ref=07]) depends only on the magnetic form factors of the nucleon, which are known from the experimental data with better accuracy than the electric form factors. Moreover, in this relation enters the ratio of the magnetic form factors of the neutron and proton, that is approximately equal to the ratio of the corresponding magnetic moments (scaling law). A measurement of the asymmetry A(Q2) could allow to obtain information about the strange axial and vector form factors of the nucleon.

We will consider now the inclusive neutrino processes

[formula]

where A is a nucleus with isotopic spin T equal to zero (as d, 4He, 12C, etc.).

The cross sections of the processes ([\ref=11]) have the following general form

[formula]

where M is the mass of the nucleus, p is the nucleus momentum, k and k' are the momenta of the initial and final neutrinos (antineutrinos), q  =  k - k', Q2  =    -  q2,

[formula]

and the hadronic tensor [formula] is given by

[formula]

In order to separate the contribution of strange axial current, let us consider the difference of the cross sections of the processes ([\ref=11]) From Eq.([\ref=12]) we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the contribution of the interference of the vector and axial currents to [formula]. In the case of a target with isospin T = 0, the interference of the isovector and isoscalar currents do not contribute to [formula] and we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us notice that in Eq.([\ref=17]) we neglected the term quadratic in the strange currents.

The first term in the Eq.([\ref=17]) is connected with the corresponding pseudotensor that determines the difference of the cross sections of inclusive CC processes

[formula]

In fact, in the region of relatively small energies (up to the threshold of charm production) the main contribution to the cross sections of the processes ([\ref=20]) comes from the ud part of the charged hadronic current:

[formula]

where v1 + i2α  =  v1α  +  i  v2α and a1 + i2α  =  a1α  +  i  a2α. For the difference of the cross sections of the processes ([\ref=20]) we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the contribution of the interference of the hadronic vector and axial currents to [formula].

From the isotopic SU(2) invariance of the strong interactions it follows that

[formula]

For the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry

[formula]

from Eqs.([\ref=16]), ([\ref=17]), ([\ref=22]) and ([\ref=23]), we obtain the following relation

[formula]

Thus, a measurement of the asymmetry A(Q2,ν) could allow to determine the relative contribution of the axial strange current to the cross sections of the NC inclusive processes ([\ref=11]) in a direct model independent way.

It was shown in Ref.[\cite=Paschos-Wirbel] that in the deep inelastic region the last term of the relation ([\ref=25]) is small. The corresponding relation for the total cross sections (the so-called Paschos-Wolfenstein relation [\cite=Paschos-Wolfenstein]) has been used in the deep inelastic region for the determination of the value of the parameter sin 2θW from CC and NC neutrino and antineutrino data. We are proposing to use relation ([\ref=25]) at intermediate neutrino energies, in which the parton approximation is not applicable and nuclei behave as bound states of nucleons. It was shown in Ref.[\cite=Donnelly92] that in this energy region the contribution of the isoscalar part of the electromagnetic current to the longitudinal part of the cross section of electron-carbon inclusive scattering is comparable with the contribution of the isovector part of the current. If there is no dynamical suppression of the contribution of the axial strange current to the asymmetry A(Q2,ν) at intermediate neutrino energies, then, in accordance with the data from EMC and other experiments, the last term in the relation ([\ref=25]) can be significant. A significant deviation of the measured asymmetry A(Q2,ν) from the known quantity (1  -  2 sin 2θW)  /  2|Vud|2  =  0.289  ±  0.004 (derived from  sin 2θW  =  0.226  ±  0.004 and |Vud|  =  0.9736  ±  0.0010 [\cite=PDG96]) would be a clear signal in favor of the importance of the contribution of the axial strange current to the hadronic matrix elements.

We would like to express our deep gratitude to A. Molinari for the useful discussions on the problem of the isoscalar current.
