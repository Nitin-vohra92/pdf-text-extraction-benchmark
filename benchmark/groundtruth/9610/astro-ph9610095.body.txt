The authors would like to thank NATO for providing a Collaborative Research Grant (CRG 920182) which facilitated our interaction. The facilities used to develop this code were provided by NSERC in Canada and PPARC in the UK. HMPC is supported by NSERC. FRP is supported by EPSRC as the PDRA for the Virgo Consortium. This work was carried out while PAT was holding a Nuffield Foundation Science Research Fellowship.
