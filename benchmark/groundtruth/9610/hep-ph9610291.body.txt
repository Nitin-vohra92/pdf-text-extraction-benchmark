Abstract

Recent experiments on the deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarized leptons on longitudinally polarized nucleons [\cite=recent_experiments] confirmed the important EMC [\cite=EMC] result: the one-nucleon matrix element of the axial strange current is relatively large and comparable with the matrix elements of the axial u and d currents. From a recent analysis of the data it follows that [\cite=Ellis-Karliner]

[formula]

The constants Δq (with q = u,d,s) are determined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the state of a nucleon with momentum p and projection of the spin on the direction sα equal to r and M is the mass of the nucleon.

The usual determination of the constants Δq from the data on deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering and from other data requires, however, several assumptions. Probably the most questionable assumption is about the Regge behavior of the polarized structure function g1 at small x.

As it is well known (see Ref.[\cite=Kaplan-Manohar]), the investigation of NC-induced processes allow us to obtain information about the matrix elements of the axial and vector strange currents in a direct way. The neutral current of the standard model in the u, d, s approximation has the form

[formula]

where v3α and a3α are the third components of the isovector vector and axial currents, [formula] is the electromagnetic current and

[formula]

are the strange vector and axial currents. From Eq.([\ref=03]) it follows that using only the isotopic SU(2) invariance of strong interactions we can connect the contributions of the strange currents to the cross sections of the NC-induced processes with measurable quantities. In Ref.[\cite=ABGM96] we have considered possibilities to extract information about the strange axial and vector form factors from the measurement of the cross sections of NC elastic and CC quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering.

We will consider here the inclusive processes

[formula]

where A is a nucleus with isotopic spin T equal to zero (as d, 4He, 12C, etc.). For a T = 0 nucleus, the interference between the isovector and isoscalar terms of the hadronic neutral current do not contribute to the cross sections of the processes ([\ref=05]). In order to separate the contribution of the axial strange current to the cross sections, let us consider the difference

[formula]

where p is the nucleus momentum, k and k' are the momenta of the initial and final neutrinos (antineutrinos), q  =  k - k', Q2  =    -  q2,

[formula]

and the pseudotensor [formula] is due to the interference of the hadronic vector and axial currents. We have

[formula]

The first term of this expression is due to the interference of V3 and A3. From the isotopic invariance of strong interactions it follows that

[formula]

where the pseudotensor [formula] determines the difference of the cross sections of the CC inclusive processes

[formula]

for relatively small energies (up to the threshold of charm production).

The pseudotensor WV0;ASαβ(p,q) in the Eq.([\ref=07]) is due to the interference of the isoscalar part of electromagnetic current and the strange axial current. With the help of Eqs.([\ref=06]) and ([\ref=08]), for the asymmetry

[formula]

we find the following expression

[formula]

The values of parameters |Vud| and sin 2θW is known with high accuracy (|Vud|  =  0.9736  ±  0.0010 and  sin 2θW  =  0.226  ±  0.004 [\cite=PDG96]). Thus, a measurement of the asymmetry A could allow to obtain a model independent information about the matrix element of the axial strange current.

Let us notice that in the deep inelastic region the last term of Eq.([\ref=11]) is small [\cite=Paschos-Wirbel] and the corresponding relation for the total asymmetry (the so-called Paschos-Wolfenstein relation [\cite=Paschos-Wolfenstein]) is used for the determination of the value of sin 2θW. We are proposing to measure the asymmetry A in the intermediate energy region, in which nuclei behave like bound states of nucleons and the contribution of the electromagnetic isoscalar current is not suppressed [\cite=Donnelly92].

It is a pleasure for us to thank A. Molinari for useful discussions on the problem of the isoscalar current.
