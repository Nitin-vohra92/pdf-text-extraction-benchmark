Past, Present and Future of Muonium

Muonium - The Atom discovered by Vernon Hughes

Atomic hydrogen is generally considered the simplest and most fundamental atom in nature. Its role in development of modern physics is outstanding. Our physical picture of atoms, the success of quantum mechanics and the start of quantum field theories such as Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) are just a few examples for insights which go back to careful analysis of what had been observed in this atom. Hydrogen has been exploited in numerous precision measurements to determine fundamental constants and to reconfirm fundamental concepts such as, e.g. the equality of the electron and proton charge units.

Unfortunately, the presence of the proton as the nucleus in this one electron atom reduces the possibilities for a complete theoretical description. Precise measurements are at present orders of magnitude more accurate than calculations can be performed. Proton properties such as its mean square charge radius or its magnetic radius or even the dynamics of the charge and spin carrying constituents inside the proton are not known to sufficient accuracy.

High energy scattering experiments have shown for leptons no structure down to dimensions of 10- 18 m. They may therefore be considered "point-like". As a consequence, complications as those arising from the structure of the nucleus in natural atoms and such artificial systems that contain hadrons are absent in the muonium atom (M  =  μ+e-), which is the bound state of two leptons, a positive muon (μ+) and an electron (e�) [\cite=Hughes_1990] [\cite=Jungmann_1999]. It may be considered a light hydrogen isotope.

The dominant interaction within the muonium atom (see Fig. [\ref=M_term]) is electromagnetic. In the framework of bound state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) the electromagnetic part of the binding can be calculated to sufficiently high accuracy for modern high precision spectroscopy experiments. There are also contributions from weak interactions arising through Z0-boson exchange and from strong interactions owing to vacuum polarization loops containing hadrons. The corresponding energy level shifts can be obtained to the required level of precision using standard theory. Precision experiments in muonium can therefore provide sensitive tests of the Standard Model of particle physics and sensitive searches for new and yet unknown forces in nature become possible. Parameters in speculative theories can be restricted. In particular, such speculations which try to expand the Standard Model in order to gain deeper insights into some of its not well understood features, i.e. where the standard theory gives well a full description, but lacks a fully satisfactory explanation of the observed facts. In addition, fundamental constants like the muon mass mμ, its magnetic moment μμ and magnetic anomaly aμ and the fine structure constant α can be measured precisely by muonium spectroscopy.

In 1960 a team led by Vernon W. Hughes has observed the muonium atom for the first time [\cite=Hughes_1960]. The details of the exciting circumstances around this discovery and the research in the early years are described in this volume by an eye witness, Richard Prepost [\cite=Prepost_2004]. They are also available from the viewpoint of the leader, Valentin Telegdi, of the very group, which was competing in muonium research with the Yale team of Vernon Hughes for more than a decade [\cite=Telegdi_1991].

Muonium Formation

In the early years muonium research concentrated on measurements that were possible with atoms created by stopping muons in a material and studying them in this environment (see Fig. [\ref=mprod]). Besides important work on condensed matter in the framework of muon spin rotation (μSR) there were in particular precision experiments which concerned the ground state hyperfine structure and a search for muonium-antimuonium conversion. In the 1980ies the spectrum of possible experiments could be significantly expanded when methods where developed which allowed to have the atoms in vacuum [\cite=Hughes_1990] [\cite=Jungmann_1999].

All high precision experiments in muonium up to date atom have involved the 1s ground state (see Fig.[\ref=M_term]), in which the atoms can be produced in sufficient quantities. The most efficient mechanism is e- capture after stopping μ+ in a suitable noble gas, where yields of 80(10) % were achieved for krypton gas. This technique was used in the most recent precision measurements of the atom's ground state hyperfine structure splitting ΔνHFS and μμ at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) in Los Alamos, USA [\cite=Liu_1999].

Muonium at thermal velocities in vacuum can be obtained by stopping μ+ close to the surface of a SiO2 powder target, where the atoms are formed through e- capture and some of them diffuse through the target surface into the surrounding vacuum. This process has an efficiency of a few percent and was an essential prerequisite for Doppler-free two-photon laser spectroscopy of the 12S1 / 2-22S1 / 2 interval Δν1s2s at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Chilton, United Kingdom [\cite=Meyer_2000], which yields an accurate value for mμ.

Electromagnetic transitions in excited states, particularly the 22S1 / 2-22P1 / 2 classical Lamb shift and 22S1 / 2-22P3 / 2 fine structure splitting could be induced by microwave spectroscopy, too. Only moderate numbers of atoms in the metastable 2s state can be produced with a beam foil technique. Because furthermore these atoms have keV energies due to a velocity resonance in their formation, the experimental accuracy is now the 1.5 % level [\cite=Ora_84] [\cite=Bad_84], which represents not yet a severe test of theory.

Muonium Ground State Hyperfine Structure

The Last LAMPF Experiment

The most recent experiment at LAMPF had a krypton gas target inside of a microwave cavity at typically atmospheric density and in a homogeneous magnetic field of 1.7 T. Microwave transitions between the two energetically highest respectively two lowest Zeeman sublevels of the n=1 state at the frequencies ν12 and ν34 (Fig. [\ref=BrRa]) involve a muon spin flip. Due to parity violation in the weak interaction muon decay process the e+ from μ+ decays are preferentially emitted in the μ+ spin direction. This allows a detection of the spin flips through a change in the spatial distribution of the decay e+. As a consequence of the Breit-Rabi equation, which describes the behaviour of the muonium ground-state Zeeman levels in a magnetic field B, the sum of ν12 and ν34 equals at any value of B the zero field splitting ΔνHFS. For sufficiently well known B the difference of these two frequencies yields the magnetic moment μμ. The latest LAMPF experiment [\cite=Liu_1999] has utilized the technique of "Old Muonium", which allowed to reduce the line width of the signals below half of the "natural" line width Δνnat  =  1 / (2πτμ) (Fig. [\ref=HFS_sig])[\cite=Bos_95], where τμ = 2.2μs is the muon lifetime. For this purpose an essentially continuous muon beam was chopped by an electrostatic kicking device into 4 μs long pulses with 14 μs separation. Only decays of atoms which had been interacting coherently with the microwave field for periods longer than several muon lifetimes were detected. Here, the first quoted uncertainty is due to the accuracy to

The magnetic moment was measured to be μμ= 3.183 345 24(37) (120 ppb) which translates into a muon-electron mass ratio μμ / me = 206.768 277(24) (120 ppb). The zero-field hyperfine splitting is determined to ΔνHFS(exp) = 4 463 302 765(53) Hz (12 ppb) which agrees well with the theoretical prediction of ΔνHFS(theo) = 4 463 302 563(520)(34)(<  100) Hz (120 ppb).

which mμ / me is known, the second error is from the knowledge of a as extracted from Penning trap measurements of the electron magnetic anomaly, and the third uncertainty corresponds to estimates of uncalculated higher order terms. Among the non-QED contributions is the strong interaction through vacuum polarization loops with hadrons (250 Hz) and a parity conserving axial vector-axial vector weak interaction (-65 Hz).

For the muonium hyperfine structure the comparison between theory and experiment is possible with almost two orders of magnitude higher precision than for natural hydrogen because of the not sufficiently known proton charge and magnetism distributions. The achieved - some six orders of magnitude higher - experimental precision in hydrogen maser experiments can unfortunately not be exploited for a better understanding of fundamental interactions. Among the possible exotic interactions, which could contribute to ΔνHFS, is muonium-antimuonium conversion [\cite=Willmann_1999]. Here, an upper limit of 9 Hz could be set from an independent experiment described in section [\ref=MMbar].

Search for CPT violation

Recently, generic extensions of the Standard Model, in which both Lorentz invariance and CPT invariance are not assumed, have attracted widespread attention in physics.

Diurnal variations of the ratio (ν12  -  ν34) / (ν12  +  ν34) are predicted (see Fig. [\ref=CPT_fig]). An upper limit could be set from a reanalysis of the LAMPF data at 2  ·  10- 23 GeV for the Lorentz and CPT violating parameter. In a specific model by Kostelecky and co-workers a dimensionless figure of merit for CPT tests is sought by normalizing this parameter to the particle mass. In this framework ΔνHFS provides a significantly better test of CPT invariance than electron g-2 and the neutral Kaon oscillations[\cite=Hughes_2001].

The Fine Structure Constant

The hyperfine splitting is proportional to α2  ·  R∞ with the very precisely known Rydberg constant R∞. Comparing experiment and theory yields α- 1= 137.035 996 3(80) (58ppb). If R∞ is decomposed into even more fundamental constants, one finds ΔνHFS  =  α4�me / h. With h / me as determined in measurements of the neutron de Broglie wavelength we have α- 1= 137.036 004 7(48) (35 ppb). In the near future a small improvement in this figure can be expected from ongoing determinations of h / me in measurements of the photon recoil in Cs. A better determination of the muon mass, e.g. will result in a further improvement and may contribute to resolving the situation of various poorly agreeing determinations of the fine structure constant, which is important in many different fields of physics.

It should be mentioned that the present agreement between α as determined from muonium hyperfine structure and from the electron magnetic anomaly is generally considered the best test of internal consistency of QED, as one case involves bound state QED and the other one QED of free particles.

Future Possibilities for ΔνHFS

The results from the LAMPF experiment are mainly statistics limited and improve the knowledge of both ΔνHFS and μμ by a factor of three over previous measurements. This gain could be significantly surpassed with an experiment based on the "Old Muonium" technique at a future high flux muon source (see section [\ref=Future]). As a useful starting point one would like to have [formula] μ+/s at below 28 MeV/c momentum with typically 1 % momentum width. The beam should be pulsed with 1μs wide pulses of up to several 10 kHz repetition frequency. One can expect that theory will be continuously improved to allow the extraction of fundamental physics information from a precision experiment[\cite=Eides_2003].

Muonium 1s-2s Two-photon Spectroscopy

In muonium the 1s-2s energy difference is essentially given by the relevant quantum numbers, R∞ and a reduced mass correction. Therefore, this transition may be regarded ideal for a determination of the muon-electron mass ratio. QED corrections are well known for the needs of presently possible precision experiments and do not play an important role here.

Doppler-free excitation of the 1s-2s transition has been achieved in pioneering experiments at KEK [\cite=Chu_88] and at RAL [\cite=Maas_94]. In all these experiments two counter-propagating pulsed laser beams at 244 nm wavelength were employed to excite the n=2 state. The successful transitions were then detected by photo-ionization with a third photon from the same laser field. The released μ+ was then registered on a micro-channel plate detector.

The recent RAL Experiment

The accuracy of the early measurements was limited by the ac-Stark effect and rapid phase fluctuations (frequency chirps), which were inherent properties of the necessary pulsed high power laser systems (see Fig. [\ref=m1s2shistory]). The key feature for the latest high accuracy measurement at RAL was a shot by shot recording of the spatial laser intensity profile as well as the time dependences of the laser light intensity and phase. This together with a newly developed theory of resonant photo-ionization [\cite=Yak_99] allowed a shot-by-shot prediction of the transition probability as a basis for the theoretical line shape (Fig. [\ref=AAA]). The latest RAL experiment [\cite=Meyer_2000] yields Δν1s2s(exp)= 2 455 528 941.0(9.8) MHz in good agreement with a theoretical value Δν1s2s(theo)=2 455 528 935.4(1.4) MHz [\cite=Pac_98]. The muon-electron mass ratio is found to be mμ+ / me- = 206.768 38(17).

Alternatively, with mm+ / me- as extracted from ΔνHFS, a comparison of experimental and theoretical values for the 1s-2s transition can be interpreted in terms of a μ+ - e- charge ratio, which results as qm+ / qe- + 1 =  - 1.1(2.1)  ·  10- 9. This is the best verification of charge equality in the first two generations of particles. The existence of one single universal quantized unit of charge is solely an experimental fact and no underlying symmetry could yet be revealed. The interest in such a viewpoint arises because gauge invariance assures charge quantization only within one generation of particles.

Slow Muons from Muonium Ionization

A new development aims at providing low energy (<  1 eV energy spread) muons for condensed matter research. At RIKEN-RAL facility a new muon source is being set-up which bases on the laser photo-ionization of muonium. The atoms are produced from hot metal foils which they leave at thermal velocities. The ionization process involves one-photon excitation of the 1s-2p transition and subsequent ionization with a second laser. At present the yield is a few μ+/s. [\cite=Nagamine_2003]

Future Muonium Laser Spectroscopy

Major progress in the laser spectroscopy of muonium can be expected from a continuous wave laser experiment, where frequency measurement accuracy does not present any problem because light phase fluctuations are absent. For this an intense source of muons will be indispensable (see section [\ref=Future]). which provides at least a factor of 1000 higher flux of (pulsed) surface muons. As a promising starting point one would like to have a pulsed beam 5  ·  108 μ+/s below 20 MeV/c with typically 3 % momentum width and about 100 Hz repetition rate.

Muonium and the Muon Magnetic Anomaly

The muon magnetic anomaly aμ (see contributions by Francis Farley and Ernst Sichtermann to this volume [\cite=Farley_2004]) is given, like in case of the electron, mostly by virtual photon and electron-positron fields. However, the effects of heavier particles can be enhanced by the square of the muon - electron mass ratio mμ / me  ≈  4  ·  104.

At the level of present experimental accuracy there are contributions to the muon magnetic anomaly which are absent in the electron case. For the muon the contributions of the strong interaction, which come in through vacuum polarization loops with hadronic content, can be determined using a dispersion relation and the input from experimental data on e+-e- annihilation into hadrons and hadronic τ-decays. They amount to 58 ppm. The weak interactions contributing through W or Z boson exchange give a 1.3 ppm correction. At present standard theory yields aμ to about 0.7 ppm. Contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model could arise from, e.g., supersymmetry, compositeness of fundamental fermions and bosons, CPT violation and many other sources. They could be at the ppm level.

The experimental values for the magnetic anomaly of μ+ and μ� have been determined very recently by a collaboration headed by Vernon Hughes at the Brookhaven national Laboratory (BNL). It is a "g-2" experiment in which the difference of the spin precession and the cyclotron frequencies is measured. The experimental results for muons of both sign of electric charge are accurate to 0.7 ppm and agree well. Assuming CPT invariance they yield a combined value of aμ to 0.5 ppm [\cite=Bennett_2004]. At this time it is unclear, whether there is a small difference between theory and experiment at the level of 2 to 3 standard deviations due to unresolved issues in the theory of hadronic corrections.

The microwave and laser spectroscopy of muonium are closely related to the measurement of the muon magnetic anomaly. The fundamental constants such as mμ, μμ, α and qμ+ / qe- are indispensable input for the theory and the experiment on aμ. It should be noted that prior to a future significant experimental improvement of aμ, such as planned at the Japanese J-PARC accelerator complex [\cite=Carey_2003], an improvement in the knowledge of muon related fundamental constants would be required. Muonium spectroscopy offers a clean way to obtain them.

Muonium-Antimuonium Conversion

In addition to the indirect searches for signatures of new physics in the muon magnetic anomaly and in electromagnetic interactions within the muonium atom the bound state offers also the possibility to search more directly for predictions of speculative models.

The process of muonium to antimuonium-conversion (M-[formula])violates additive lepton family number conservation. It would be an analogy in the lepton sector to the well known K0-[formula] and B0-[formula] oscillations in the quark sector. Muonium-antimuonium conversion appears naturally in many theories beyond the Standard Model. The interaction could be mediated, e.g., by a doubly charged Higgs boson Δ+  +, Majorana neutrinos, a neutral scalar, a supersymmetric τ-sneutrino , or a doubly charged bileptonic gauge boson.

There have been a number of attempts to observe M-[formula] conversion. The pioneering work was again performed by a group guided by Vernon Hughes already in the 1960ies [\cite=Amato_1967]. The early experiments [\cite=Amato_1967] [\cite=Huber_1990] relied on the X-rays which would follow a μ--transfer to a heavy element upon contact of [formula] with matter as part of their signature. A breakthrough was the availability of thermal muonium in vacuum [\cite=Woodle_1988] which led to a significant increase in sensitivity [\cite=Matthias_1991].

The latest M-[formula] Experiment at PSI

At PSI an experiment was designed to exploit a powerful new signature, which requires the coincident identification of both particles forming the anti-atom in its decay [\cite=Willmann_1999]. The technique had been pioneered by an international collaboration led by Vernon Hughes at LAMPF [\cite=Matthias_1991].

Thermal muonium atoms in vacuum from a SiO2 powder target, are observed for decays. Energetic electrons from the decay of the μ- in the atom can be identified in a magnetic spectrometer (Fig. [\ref=exp_mmb]). The positron in the atomic shell of [formula] is left behind after the decay with 13.5 eV average kinetic energy. It has been post-accelerated and guided in a magnetic transport system onto a position sensitive micro-channel plate detector (MCP). Annihilation radiation can be observed in a segmented pure CsI calorimeter around it. The decay vertex can be reconstructed. The measurements were performed during a period of 6 months in total over 4 years during which 5.7  ·  1010 muonium atoms were in the interaction region. One event fell within a 99% confidence interval of all relevant distributions. The expected background due to accidental coincidences is 1.7(2) events (Fig. [\ref=MMB_sig]). Depending on the interaction details one has to account for a suppression of the conversion in the 0.1 T magnetic field in the spectrometer. This amounts maximally to a factor of about 3 for V±  A type interactions. Thus, the upper limit on the conversion probability is 8.2  ·  10- 11 (90% C.L.). The coupling constant is bound to below 3.0  ·  10- 3 ~ GF, where GF is the weak interaction Fermi coupling constant.

This new result, which exceeds limits from previous experiments by a factor of 2500 and one from an early stage of the experiment by 35, has some impact on speculative models. For example: A certain Z8 model is ruled out. It had more than 4 generations of particles and where masses could be generated radiatively with heavy lepton seeding. A new lower limit of 2.6 TeV/c2  ×  g3l (95% C.L.) on the masses of flavour diagonal bileptonic gauge bosons in GUT models is extracted, which lies well beyond the value derived from direct searches, measurements of the muon magnetic anomaly or high energy Bhabha scattering. Here, g3l is of order unity and depends on the details of the underlying symmetry. For 331 models the experimental result can be translated into � 850 GeV/c2  ×  g3l which excludes some of their minimal Higgs versions, where an upper bound of 600 GeV/c2 has been extracted from an analysis of electro-weak parameters. The 331 models need now to refer to a less attractive and more complicated extensions. In the framework of R-parity violating supersymmetry the bound on the relevant coupling parameters could be lowered by a factor of 15 to λ132  ·  λ231  ≤  3  ·  10- 4 for assumed super-partner masses of 100 GeV/c2.

Future Possibilities for M-[formula] Experiments

A future experiment to search for M-[formula] conversion could particularly take advantage of high intensity pulsed beams. In contrast to other lepton (family) number violating muon decays, the conversion through its nature as particle-antiparticle oscillation has a time evolution in which the probability for finding a system formed as muonium decaying as [formula] increases quadratically in time. This gives the signal an advantage, which grows in time over exponentially decaying background. E.g., with a twofold coincidence as part of a signature: after a time ΔT  =  2τμ beam related accidental background has dropped by almost two orders of magnitude, whereas a M-[formula]-signal would not have suffered significantly at all. An almost ideal beam would have 1  ·  1010 μ+/s at below 23 MeV/c with typically 1-2 % momentum width. The beam should be pulsed with up to 1μs wide pulses of up to several 10 kHz repetition frequency.

Such efforts appear well motivated among other reasons through the connection to numerous speculative models involving, e.g., lepton flavour violation in general or a possible Majorana nature of the neutrinos [\cite=Clark_2003].

Future Possibilities for Fundamental Interaction Research with Muons

It appears that the availability of particles limits at present progress in research with muonium. This includes better fundamental constants as well as the possibility to find very rare processes and to impose significantly improved limits in continuation of the search program of dedicated experiments.

Therefore significant measures to boost the muon fluxes at existing accelerator centers and to create future facilities with orders of magnitude higher muon currents is indispensable prior to any significant progress. This requirement matches well with the demand of several communities within physics which request an intense particle accelerator. Such interest exists, e.g., worldwide for a Neutrino Factory and a Muon Collider [\cite=Alsharo_2003], in Japan for the J-PARC facility and in Europe for EURISOL facility [\cite=Ridicus_2003]. The perspectives for muonium research have beam worked out for such a scenario in some detail [\cite=Alsharo_2003].

Examples of tailored intense muon sources at existing facilities are the π  -  μ converter at PSI, the planned muon production of the planned MECO experiment at BNL or the projected phase rotated intense source of muons (PRISM) [\cite=Kuno_2003] in connection with the upcoming J-PARC facility.

The design goal for such a new machine should be a minimum of 1 MW proton beam on a production target. This could become a reality at various places including BNL, CERN, GSI and J-PARC.

Conclusions

More than 70 years after the muon was discovered [\cite=Kunze_1933], its properties still remain puzzling. The mysteries include not less than the reason for the muon's existence, the size of its mass, its charge and the fact of lepton number (and for charged species) lepton family number conservation. All precision experiments to date have confirmed that the muon is a heavy copy of the "point-like" electron. Standard theory appears to be an adequate description of all measurements, although it cannot answer some of the deeper questions.

Searches for a violation of the Standard Model were not blessed with a successful observation yet. However, both the theoretical and experimental work in this connection have led to a much deeper understanding of particle interactions. One special value of the precision experiments are their continuous contributions towards guiding theoretical developments by excluding various speculative models. The research of Vernon Hughes has most significantly added to shaping our knowledge about nature in this way. Research on muonium has contributed quite some essential facets to the picture of fundamental particles and fundamental interactions in physics.

Final Remarks

The author owes his heartily gratitude to Vernon Willard Hughes for a long fruitful collaboration in the framework of a number of international collaborations. The measurements we could carry out together all involved muons. In particular, many of them involved centrally the fundamental atom we could find for our research:

Thank You Vernon for introducing muonium to the scientific community.
