Introduction

The notion of energy-momentum localization has been one of the most interesting and thorny problems which remains unsolved since the advent of general theory of relativity. Misner et al. [\cite=MTW] argued that the energy is localizable only for spherical systems. Cooperstock and Sarracino [\cite=CS] contradicted their viewpoint and argued that if the energy is localizable in spherical systems then it is also localizable for all systems. Bondi [\cite=Bo] expressed that a non-localizable form of energy is inadmissible in relativity and its location can in principle be found. In a series of papers, Cooperstock [\cite=COO] hypothesized that in a curved space-time energy and momentum are confined to the region of non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor Tab and consequently the gravitational waves are not carriers of energy and momentum in vacuum space-times. This hypothesis has neither been proved nor disproved. There are many results support this hypothesis (see for example, [\cite=Xulu] [\cite=Gad2]). It would be interesting to investigate the cylindrical gravitational waves in vacuum space-time. We use Landau-Lifshitz and Bergmann-Thomson energy-momentum complexes to investigate whether or not these waves have energy and momentum densities.

The foremost endeavor to solve the problem of energy-momentum localization was the energy-momentum complex introduced by Einstein(E) [\cite=E]. After this many physicists, for instance, Tolman (T) [\cite=T], Landau and Lifshitz (LL) [\cite=LL], Papapetrou (P) [\cite=P], Bergmann (B) [\cite=B] and Weinberg (W) [\cite=W] (abbreviated to (ETLLPBW), in the sequel) have given different definitions for the energy-momentum complexes. The major difficlty with these attempts was that energy-momentum complexes had to be computed in quasi-Cartesian coordinates. Møller (M) [\cite=E1] introduced a consistent expression which enables one to evaluate energy and momentum in any coordinate system. Although of these drawbacks, some interesting results obtained recently lead to the conclusion that these energy-momentum complexes give the same energy distribution for a given space-time [\cite=V1]-[\cite=V8]. Aguirregabiria, Chamorro and Virbhadra [\cite=V9] showed that the five different energy-momentum complexes (ELLPBW) give the same result for the energy distribution for any Kerr-Schild metric. Recently, Virbhadra [\cite=V99] investigated whether or not these definitions (ELLPBW) lead to the same result for the most general non-static spherically symmetric metric and found that they disagree. He noted that the energy-momentum complexes (LLPW) give the same result as in the Einstein prescription if the calculations are performed in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates. However, the complexes (ELLPW) disagree if computations are done in "Schwarzschild Cartesian coordinates ".

Some interesting results [\cite=Xulu1]-[\cite=Gad3] led to the conclusion that in a given space-time, such as: the Reissner-Nordstörm, the de Sitter-Schwarzschild, the charged regular metric, the stringy charged black hole and the Gödel-type space-time, the energy distribution according to the energy-momentum complex of Einstein is different from that of Møller. But in some specific case [\cite=E1] [\cite=Xulu1] [\cite=V97] [\cite=V99] (the Schwarzschild, the Janis-Newman-Winicour metric) have the same result.

The scope of this paper is to evaluate the energy and momentum densities for the solutions exhibiting directional singularities using Landau-Lifshitz and Bergmann-Thomson energy-momentum complexes. In general relativity the term "directional singularity" is applied if the limit of an invariant scalar (Kretschmann scalar [formula], [formula] are the components of the Riemann tensor) depends upon the direction by which the singularity is approached. One of the best known examples of such directional behavior is the Curzon singularity occurring at R  =  0 in the Weyl metric [\cite=11]. Gautreau and Anderson [\cite=GA] showed that for the field of a Curzon [\cite=Curzon] particle, the Kretschmann scalar [formula] tends to the value zero along the z-axis but becomes infinite for other straight line trajectory to the origin. A more detailed analysis ecoompassing a wider class of curves was carried out by Cooperstock and Junevicus [\cite=CJ].

Through this paper we use G  =  1 and c  =  1 units and follow the convention that Latin indices take value from 0 to 3 and Greek indices take value from 1 to 3.

The quantity L00 represents the energy density of the whole physical system including gravitation and L0α represents the components of the total momentum (energy current) density.

In order to evaluate the energy and momentum densities in Landau-Lifshitz's prescription associated with the Weyl metric ([\ref=1]), we evaluate the non-zero components of Sikjl

Discussion

Using different definitions of energy-momentum complex, several authors studied the energy distribution for a given space-time. Most of them restricted their intention to the static and non-static spherically symmetric space-times. Rosen [\cite=R] calculated the energy and momentum densities of a non-static cylindrical space-time using the energy-momentum pseudo tensors of Einstein and Landau-Lifshitz. He found, if the calculations are preformed in cylindrical polar coordinates, that the energy and momentum density components vanish. When the calculations are carried out in Cartesian coordinates, Rosen and Virbhadra [\cite=RV] evaluated these quantities using Einstein's prescription and found that these quantities turn out to be non-vanishing and reasonable. Virbhadra [\cite=V5] used Tolman, Landau-Lifshitz and papapetrou's prescriptions and found that they give the same energy and momentum densities for the aforementioned space-time and agree with the results obtained by using Einstein's prescription.

In our previous two papers [\cite=Gad4] we have calculated the energy and momentum densities associated with a general static axially symmetric vacuum space-time, using Einstein, Papapetrou and Møller's energy-momentum complexes. We found that these definitions do not provide the same energy density, while give the same momentum density.

In this paper, we calculated the energy and momentum density components for this space-time using Landau-Lifshitz and Bergmann-Thomson energy-momentum complexes. Further, using these results we obtained the energy and momentum densities for the Curzon metric. We found that for both, Weyl and Curzon metrics, the Landau-Lifshitz and Bergmann-Thomson give exactly the same momentum density but do not provide the same energy density, except only at R  →    ∞  , in the case of Curzon metric, where the energy density tends to zero.

Furthermore, we have made a comparison of our results with those calculated [\cite=Gad4] using (EPM) prescriptions. We obtained that the five prescriptions (ELLPBM) give the same result regarding the momentum density associated with Weyl as well as Curzon metrics. Concerning the energy density associated with both two metrics under consideration, we found that these prescriptions (ELLPBM) do not give the same result except when R  →    ∞  , in the case of Curzon metric, where the energy in all prescriptions (ELLPBM) tends to zero. Finally, in the case of Curzon metric we see that the energy in the prescriptions (ELLPB) diverges at the singularity (R  =  0), but it will never diverge in Møller's prescription.
