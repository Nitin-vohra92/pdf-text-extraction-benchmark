Steering Distillation Processes through Zeno Effect

A distillation process, in its essence, is nothing but a systematic way of driving a system toward a state nonorthogonal to its initial condition. In some sense thus, it often represents the realization of a projection operator. In recent years, efforts have been made to realize distillation procedures since they might be exploited to prepare and to control at one's will the state of a quantum system. In the field of quantum technology[\cite=qtech] covering such research areas like quantum computation, quantum information or quantum teleportation it is, for instance, usually assumed that a desired state, which is necessary to start with a specific quantum manipulation, can be in principle prepared. In reality, however, it is not at all trivial and we have to specify explicitly how such a preparation is actually implemented. Various distillation processes have been proposed for this purpose so far [\cite=qpp].

Recently a general and new strategy of distillation specifically addressed to bipartite systems has been reported [\cite=NakazatoPRL]. Its goal is to drive the subsystem of interest (called Slave) toward a final state by repeated measurement acts performed on the auxiliary subsystem (called Master), in interaction with the former, provided the latter part is always found in the same state. This conditional procedure, inspired by the Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements (QND) [\cite=QND], shares with the latter the difficulty of singling out the suitable Master-Slave coupling allowing the selection of a prefixed target state. Such an intrinsic weakness poses limitations on the practical application of the method.

In this letter we propose an effective way of overcoming this structural drawback. Our scope is indeed to demonstrate the systematic possibility of controlling the distillation mechanism, furnishing conditions on the coupling to reach prefixed target subspaces. The key tool to suitably modify the two-subsystem interaction is the generalized Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) [\cite=FacchiPascazioPRL] [\cite=QZE] [\cite=FacchiPascazioReview].

Consider two interacting systems, referred to as Master (M) and Slave (S). Let [formula] denote a basis of M, and [formula] indicate a basis of S. Let us denote by Û(τ) = e- iĤτ the time evolution operator ([formula]) for time τ, Ĥ  =  Ĥ0 being the compound system hamiltonian.

Perform a measurement of the Master state, and assume that the result is [formula]. Let the system evolve for time τ under Ĥ, then perform another measurement of the Master, and so on N times. Assume that at each step the Master system is found into the state [formula]. Under such a hypothesis the compound system is subjected to a non-unitary time evolution described by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a non-unitary operator describing the transformation that the Slave state undergoes owing to both the time evolution Û(τ) and the projection following the successful measurement act on M. The normalization constant [formula] takes into account the probability of finding M in the state [formula] N times.

Let us solve the eigenvalue problem related to V̂(τ). Since this operator is not hermitian, generally its right and left eigenvalue problems turn out to have different solutions. Assume now that it is possible to diagonalize the operator V̂(τ) in the standard way [\cite=NUY04]

[formula]

where {P̂k} are orthogonal projection operators satisfying the completeness relation [formula], S being the Slave identity operator.

Introducing γ  =   max k{|γk|}, for large enough N, one finds

[formula]

If a unique eigenvalue of V̂(τ) having modulus γ exists and in addition it is non-degenerate, then the distillation procedure realizes just a single-state selection.

The success of such a procedure is based upon the realization of some specific conditions. First of all, observe that what we have done is implementing a projection operator into a Slave subspace determined by the specific Master-Slave interaction and by the repeatedly detected Master state. Hence in order to reach the goal of distilling a state, such a state should be included in the initial state. Moreover, the evolution leading to the target state is not deterministically followed by the system, instead it is a conditional one. In fact there are N stochastic intermediate steps (the measurement acts), and each one of them should be done successfully, that is, at each Master measurement step the result should be [formula] (or some other prefixed Master State, but always the same).

Assume that the orthonormal basis [formula] constitutes the eigenstates of V̂(τ). Accordingly, the action of the unitary operator Û(τ) on the state [formula] induces transitions to other Master states but leaves unchanged the Slave state which factorizes [formula], i.e., [formula] →   [formula] [formula], [formula] being the relevant survival probability. Therefore one immediately finds

[formula]

Such a decomposition gives a precise physical meaning to the moduli of the eigenvalues of V̂(τ) and shows that the distilled (preserved) Slave states (corresponding to higher eigenvalue moduli) are those undergoing a unitary evolutions (between two measurement acts) which do not induce (or induce smaller) abandon of the initial Master states [formula] in favor of the others [formula], [formula]. Therefore, each state [formula] may be thought of as a channel of probability loss, which may be opened or closed depending on the specific features of Û(τ).

Consider now the case wherein all the transition channels are going to be closed, i.e. all transitions from [formula] to different Master states are hindered. Such a circumstance may occur under the presence of an external agent, the freezing agent, related to a hamiltonian Ĥ12 responsible for an additional coupling between Master and Slave. Hence, in the lapse between two Master detections, the dynamics of the compound system is governed by ĤΛ  =  Ĥ0  +  ΛĤ12, where Λ is the strength of the new coupling term. Let us denote by [formula] the relevant evolution operator.

It is well known that the stronger the new interaction term (i.e., the bigger Λ) is, the more the dynamics is governed by Ĥ12 [\cite=FacchiPascazioPRL]. This means that the time evolution exhibits invariant subspaces related substantially to Ĥ0 when Λ approaches 0 and those related to the structure of Ĥ12 as Λ grows enough [\cite=FacchiPascazioPRL]. Depending on the specific features of Ĥ0 and Ĥ12, it is possible to provide an interpretation of this change of dynamical regime in terms of the Continuous Measurement Quantum Zeno Effect or Zeno Dynamics [\cite=FacchiPascazioReview]. To better understand this point of view, consider the particular case wherein the hamiltonian Ĥ0 governs Slave-state-dependent oscillations between the two Master states [formula] and [formula], while Ĥ12 couples states characterized by the Master states [formula] and [formula]. In this case the second coupling term may be thought of as an observer that, watching at the system following the unperturbed dynamics governed by Ĥ0, is able to freeze it into the initial Master state [formula] [\cite=FacchiPascazioReview]. The larger the watching-strength (Λ) is, the stronger the freezing effect is. Since Ĥ12 is, generally speaking, responsible for a Slave-state-dependent quantum Zeno effect, the distillation may be made ineffective/effective, depending on the corresponding Hilbert subspaces of the Slave.

The ability of controlling the channel opening/closing is improvable when the more general case of Hierarchically Controlled Dynamics [\cite=MilitelloFortPh] [\cite=FacchiPascazioPRL] is considered, instead of the Zeno effect. In fact, the action of a subsequent coupling, let us denote it by Ĥ23 assuming for simplicity that it involves Master states [formula] and [formula] only, can hinder the hindering effect of Ĥ12. As a very simplified toy-model clarifying this point, let us consider, parenthetically, the following 4  ×  4 tridiagonal matrix, expressing a coupling scheme between the states of a four-level system:

[formula]

The four-level system, whose relevant dynamics is here described, performs Rabi oscillations between the two lowest states (those coupled by Ω) when Λ  =  Γ = 0. Such a dynamical regime corresponds to the unperturbed time evolution. As Λ is made non-vanishing, the dynamics becomes more and more complicated until the condition Λ  ≫  Ω is reached. In such a situation, the dynamics of the lowest level is frozen, and this is just the continuous measurement quantum Zeno effect already recalled. Once Γ is also adjusted as a non-vanishing coupling constant, an unexpected phenomenon does happen: as Γ grows up, the effect due to the strong coupling Λ between the second and the third levels becomes weaker and weaker, up to the point, identified by the condition Γ  ≫  Λ, wherein the original Rabi oscillations are completely restored. In agreement with Refs. [\cite=FacchiPascazioPRL] [\cite=FacchiPascazioReview], one can interpret Λ- and Γ-couplings as continuous  measurements so that it is possible to give the following metaphorical statement: a watched pot never boils (Λ  ≫  Ω, Γ = 0) but a watched cook can freely watch a boiling pot(Λ  ≫  Ω, Γ  ≫  Λ) [\cite=FacchiPascazioPRL].

In passing, we mention the fact that the hierarchical chain of interactions in principle may be extended (with further rings), maintaining the same substantial features: the last ring of the chain is able to destroy the effects of the previous one depending on how the relevant coupling strengths compare to each other. For instance we could add a fifth level and a fourth coupling involving the fourth and fifth levels. In this way, we obtain a 5  ×  5 tridiagonal matrix. In concomitance with an increase of the fourth-coupling strength, the hindering of inhibition given by the third coupling (Γ) is hindered.

Coming back to our original problem, since the third coupling, Ĥ23, is Slave-state-dependent too, it can differently exert its effect subspace by subspace. Such a circumstance, of course, enlarges our ability of controlling the dynamical behavior of the compound system and hence the distillation process.

In the light of such considerations, we can express the main result of this paper as follows. A continuous measurement quantum Zeno effect, involving Master states in a Slave-state-dependent way, is able to hinder the Ĥ0-governed unperturbed dynamics, eventually closing channels for Slave-state probability loss, which are open in the unperturbed dynamics. Hence the final distillation result may be predicted and, moreover, a priori decided, by exploiting the very clear mechanism of channel-closing or opening in connection with our will of preserving or non-preserving the corresponding Slave states. Moreover, we can go through a hierarchically controlled dynamics of the compound Master-Slave system, improving our ability in implementing the filter.

Let us now consider, as an example of this strategy, a three-level system (the Master) coupled to a harmonic oscillator (the Slave). Such a physical system may be realized in the context of trapped ions [\cite=ManiscalcoFortPh].

As is well known, a time-dependent quadrupolar electric field is able to confine a charged particle, providing an effective quadratic potential that induces a harmonic motion. When the confined particle is an ion, the complete result is a compound system possessing both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom, the first ones describing the internal motion of the electrons with respect to the atomic nucleus, the second ones describing the ion center-of-mass motion. In most of the experiments, only a few atomic states are really involved in the dynamics and a single vibrational mode is considered. Following Ref. [\cite=ManiscalcoFortPh], it is possible to realize an experimental setup which involves, in the dynamics, only the following three atomic levels, [formula], [formula] [formula], using a magnetic field of 1 mT to obtain the useful level splittings (ω(e2) - ω(e1)  ≈  100 MHz, ω(g) - ω(e1)  ≈  1 GHz), and exploiting the auxiliary level [formula] to realize Raman coupling schemes.

Consider now the action of two effective (i.e., implemented via Raman schemes) lasers, one tuned to the pth blue or red sideband of the atomic transition [formula], and the other to the qth blue or red sideband of the atomic transition [formula] →   [formula]. The relevant interaction-picture hamiltonian in the Rotating Wave Approximation is given by[\cite=MilitelloPLA]

[formula]

where p and q are integer numbers related to the specific choice of the laser frequencies (sidebands), Ω and Λ are coupling constants proportional to the laser intensities, ηj (j = 1,2) are the relevant Lamb-Dicke parameters expressing the ratio between the vibrational ground state oscillation amplitudes and the laser wavelengths, â is the harmonic-oscillator annihilation operator (here the notation is such that [formula] for positive s), while [formula], [formula] and [formula] are the three atomic states effectively involved in the dynamics. The functions fp and fq express nonlinear vibrational energy dependence of vibronic couplings and are such that for very small Lamb-Dicke parameters (η  ≪  1), they almost approach unity, while for larger values of η they exhibit a strongly nonlinear behavior in the variable â†â, and possesses some zeroes.

Considering the unitary evolution due to ĤΛ in [\eqref=Model_3lev_Oscillator] in the special regime Λ = 0 and p = 0, and repeatedly detecting the atomic state [formula] leads to the standard quantum non-demolition measurements, by which it is possible to extract, i.e. distill, a number state [\cite=QND] [\cite=NakazatoPRL]. More in detail, denoting by [formula] the harmonic oscillator Fock states, the effective non-unitary evolution operator acting upon the vibrational state is given by

[formula]

Since in this case the Fock states are eigenstates of V̂(τ), we have [formula]. It is possible to choose [formula] such that [formula]. Taking into account that for [formula], f0(n,η1) and [formula] are incommensurable, the eigenvector [formula], and it only, is preserved by the distillation procedure ([formula]), while all the others are partially destroyed at each atomic state detection ([formula] for [formula]).

Consider now the effect of the freezing agent, i.e., assume [formula]. In this case the total Hamiltonian, ĤΛ, is substantially characterized by three-dimensional invariant subspaces, [formula], wherein the operator may be represented as a 3  ×  3 block of the form

[formula]

with Ωn  =   [formula], Λn  =   [formula] . Of course, depending on p and q, there could exist also invariant doublets and singlets. For instance, in correspondence to n - p < 0 there is a singlet, while if n - p  ≥  0 and n - p - q < 0 there is a doublet.

It is straightforward to evaluate the non-unitary operator [formula]. In particular, in the case p = 0 (previously analyzed in absence of freezing agent), we obtain

[formula]

with [formula]. The operator is diagonal in the Fock basis.

It is easy to see that in correspondence to continuous measurement quantum Zeno effect (Λn  ≫  Ωn) in the nth subspace (the subspace the state [formula] belongs to), the channel of probability loss is closed, otherwise it could be open. Therefore, the ability of controlling the dependence on n of the quantum Zeno effect incoming, plays the role of a real handle grip by which it is possible to open and close distillation channels. As a specific application, consider the dynamical regime characterized by Λ  ≫  Ω, p = 0 and, in order to have fq(n - q,η2) almost constant and non-vanishing for all Fock states, η2  ≪  1. Under such hypotheses, Λn  ≫  Ωn, [formula]. If the measurement interval τ is not fine-tuned, i.e., [formula], [formula], where τ(k)j satisfies Ωf0(j,η1)τ(k)j = kπ, all Fock states with an excitation number less than q are eliminated in the course of repeated measurements, hence realizing the projector [formula]. That is,

[formula]

As another specific application, consider the implementation of the projector [formula]. In order to reach the goal, we consider the case where Λ  ≫  Ω, p = q = 0, η2 large enough to make the zeroes of f0 visible also for not extremely high [formula]: [formula] [formula], and τ is such that [formula]. In this case, all channels result to be closed (because of the condition Λn  ≫  Ωn, for [formula]) except for that related to the [formula]th subspace (being [formula]).

In conclusion, in this paper we have addressed the general problem of how to project a quantum system in a desired prefixed subspace. We have indeed improved the distillation approach based upon repeated measurements on a part of a bipartite system[\cite=NakazatoPRL] introducing the generalized Quantum Zeno Effect as a control mechanism of the two-subsystem-interaction determining the target subspace. In other words, our main and novel result is that the presence of such a control mechanism acts upon the interaction transforming the original distillation process into a driven distillation. We conclude emphasizing that the method and the idea presented in this letter are general and then exploitable in different physical context both for fundamental and technological scopes.
