Cosmic Ray Astrophysics with AMS-02

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a cosmic ray (CR) experiment that will operate on the International Space Station for three years, measuring the particle spectra in the rigidity range from 0.2 GV to 2 TV. The AMS-02 detector will provide measurements with unprecedented statistics of the hadronic and leptonic cosmic rays, allowing for a better study of the Earth magnetosphere through the secondaries produced by CR interactions in the atmosphere; of the solar system environment through the measurement of the solar modulation over a long period; of the solar system neighborhood through the measurement of the ratio between unstable isotopes and stable elements; of the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through the ratio between secondary and primary isotopes and the measurement of proton and helium spectra.

Introduction

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a cosmic ray (CR) experiment that will operate on the International Space Station (ISS) for three years, measuring the particle spectra in the rigidity range from 0.2 GV to 2 TV. The first version of the detector, called AMS-01, was flown on board of the space shuttle Discovery in 1998, from June 2 to 12. The second version of the detector, called AMS-02, will operate on the ISS starting from year 2007. AMS-01 collected more than hundred million events, and the results were published about the CR protons and antiprotons, helium, electrons and positrons, and the upper limit on the antimatter ratio (for a review, see Ref. [\cite=ams01]).

The physics goals of the AMS experiment are: (1) the search for antinuclei among the CR, that would be a smoking gun in favor of the existence of cosmic antimatter in form of anti-stars (figure [\ref=fig1], left panel, shows the upper limits on the antihelium to helium ratio); (2) the search for signatures of the supersymmetric dark matter candidates, looking at the antiproton and positron spectra (figure [\ref=fig1], right panel, shows the expected distortion of the positron to electron ratio that would be produced by the annihilation of 65 GeV/c2 neutralinos [\cite=lamanna03]); (3) the high-statistics study of the CR particle spectra up to 1-2 TV rigidity.

The AMS-02 detector (figure [\ref=fig2]) is able to make multiple measurements of the energy lost by the particles traversing it, of their track and of their velocity [\cite=ams02]. The basic technique for particle recognition lays on the measurement of the energy loss, giving the particle charge absolute value, of the track curvature, giving the particle rigidity, and of the velocity value and direction, that gives the charge sign together with the curvature measurement.

The anticoincidence system (ACC) vetoes tracks crossing the magnet, hence all particles must traverse the transition radiation detector (TRD), the time of flight system (TOF), the silicon tracker and the proximity focusing erenkov detector (RICH). About half of them will also produce a shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), placed below the RICH. RICH and TOF are used to distinguish electrons and positrons from antiprotons and protons down to 0.2 GeV, whereas TRD and ECAL allow for the e/p separation up to 300 GeV, that is the upper energy limit for the antiproton and positron measurements. Nuclei can be separated from antinuclei up to the maximum detectable rigidity, i.e. up to 2 TV. Finally, gamma rays can be detected in the largely unexplored energy range above few tens of GeV.

This paper focuses on the "ordinary" CR astrophysics items that can be studied with the help of the AMS-02 detector. They are necessary steps before anyone will trust the possible exotic results of the measurement, but they are also important for the understanding of our Galactic environment.

Earth Magnetosphere

Figure [\ref=fig3] shows the trapped electrons and positrons measured by AMS-01, as function of the geographic coordinates. The orbit inclination was 51.7[formula] and the altitude ranged between 350 and 390 km. Field countours at 380 km are also shown. Back-tracing every event, all particles started from the Earth atmosphere were considered secondary [\cite=ams01el]. Secondary electrons and positrons were detected after a time τ since their creation, and it was found that they can be divided into two populations: "short-lived" e+/e-   (τ < 0.1 s, left panel) originated uniformly (one can follow the AMS-01 orbits in the left panel), whereas "long-lived" e+/e-   (τ > 1 s, right panel) were bouncing between two mirror points. This is due to the kinematics of charged particles in the asymmetric geomagnetic field, that was sampled by a detector moving between geomagnetic latitudes from roughly 75[formula] North to 75[formula] South. Hence, an orbiting detector is a powerful instrument to study the trapped particles in the geomagnetic field.

Solar Modulation

The solar activity, parametrized with the number of sun spots or with the value of the interplanetary magnetic field, is anticorrelated with the total CR flux on the top of the atmosphere, as measured for example with high mountain neutron detectors. The Sun affects the diffusion of charged particles below several GeV/nucl following its 22-years cycles (solar modulation). Figure [\ref=fig4], left panel, shows the solar modulation first-order effect on the proton spectrum measured by AMS-01 [\cite=casadei03], that it is expected to be a single power-law in rigidity R  =  pc  /  (Ze) down to hundred MV. At the next order, the solar modulation has a charge-sign dependent effect that can be best seen in the antiparticle/particle ratio, as shown in the right panel with antiprotons. This plot shows also the expected statistics for AMS-02, that has the potential to discover high energy bumps that could be produced by exotic sources, like the annihilation of neutralinos, the supersymmetric candidates for the dark matter [\cite=lamanna03].

Local bubble and solar system neighborhood

The solar system is inside the "local bubble", a low-density region with scale length of 100 pc with irregular shape, that is the result of the explosion of several supernovae in the neighborhood [\cite=maiz01]. Recent simulations [\cite=maurin02] show that the ratio between unstable and stable isotopes is very sensitive to the features of the local bubble. Figure [\ref=fig5], left panel, shows the expected AMS-02 statistics for the 10Be/9Be measurement.

One can probe larger distances measuring the electron and positron spectra, and the ratio between stable secondary species to primary nuclei, like the ratios of Li, Be and B to C. In particular, electrons (figure [\ref=fig5], right panel) can diffuse for relatively short time compared to CR nuclei, because of their large radiative losses. High energy electrons (with E  ~  1 TeV) can reach distances of the order of 1 kpc, comparable with the galactic disk thicness, and lower energy electrons can propagate further beyond this limit: with electrons, the spherical propagation model becomes a rough approximation and a two-phases (disk and halo) cylindrical model is normally used.

Galactic Interstellar Medium

A two-phases cylindrical model of the Galaxy is also used to simulate the propagation of protons and helium nuclei (figure [\ref=fig6]) in the interstellar medium, where they diffuse for roughly 2  ×  107 years. Protons and helium nuclei are the deepest charged probes of the Galaxy: they diffuse on the average through one third of the Galactic disk and in the halo, before being measured [\cite=maurin02]. Other primary nuclei, like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron, travel for long distances in the interstellar medium, where their interactions produce the secondary nuclei (Li, Be, B, and sub-Fe elements) that are not produced by the stellar nucleosynthesis, and whose fluxes are used to constrain the parameters of the galactic CR diffusion. AMS-02 will provide very accurate measurements of all elements up to Fe, thus allowing for a deeper knowledge of the characteristics of the CR sources (supernova explosions) and the interstellar medium.
