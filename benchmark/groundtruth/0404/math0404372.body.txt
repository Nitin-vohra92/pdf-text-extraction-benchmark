A short proof of a theorem of Morton Brown on chains of cells

Introduction

Consider the following theorem due to Morton Brown [\cite=B-cell]:

Suppose that a topological space [formula] is the union of an increasing sequence of open subsets Ui each of which is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space [formula]. Then X is homeomorphic to [formula].

The aim of this paper is to give a very short proof of this theorem, based on other two theorems by Morton Brown concerning near homeomorphisms and cellular sets. These theorems read:

Let (Xn) be an inverse sequence of compact metric spaces with limit X∞. If all bonding maps Xk  →  Xn are near homeomorphisms, then so are the limit projections X∞  →  Xn.

Let F be a closed subset of the n-sphere Sn. The following conditions are equivalent:

F is cellular;

the quotient map Sn  →  Sn / F (which collapses F to a point) is a near homeomorphism;

the quotient space Sn / F is homeomorphic to Sn.

Let f:Sn  →  Sn be a map of the n-sphere onto itself such that only one point-inverse of f has more than one point. Then f is a near homeomorphism.

Let us explain the notions used in these theorems. A map X  →  Y between compact spaces is a near homeomorphism if it is in the closure of the set of all homeomorphisms from X onto Y, with respect to the compact-open topology on the space C(X,Y) of all maps from X to Y. A (closed) n-cell is a space homeomorphic to the closed n-cube n. A compact subset C of a Hausdorff n-manifold M is cellular if it has a base of open neighbourhoods in M homeomorphic to [formula], or, equivalently, if it is the intersection of a decreasing sequence (Bk) of closed n-cells such that each Bk + 1 lies in the interior of Bk.

Cellular sets were used in the beautiful paper [\cite=B-Sch] to prove the Generalized Schoenflies Theorem [\cite=D]. For that, a stronger version of Corollary [\ref=cor] was needed: every onto self-map of Sn with two non-trivial point-inverses is a near homeomorphism. This requires a little more effort. For our purposes, the elementary Theorem [\ref=cell] suffices. To make the paper less dependent on external sources, we show in Section 3 that Theorem [\ref=cell] readily follows from Bing's Shrinking Criterion.

A short proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

The proof can be made one line: consider one point compactifications, and apply Corollary [\ref=cor] and Theorem [\ref=near]. We now elaborate.

Let [formula] be the union of an increasing sequence of open subsets Ui each of which is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space [formula]. Note that X must be Hausdorff: any two points x,y∈X lie in a Hausdorff open subspace Uk. Let [formula] be the one point compactification of X. Let Fi be the complement of Ui in X∞. Let Xi = X∞ / Fi be the space obtained by collapsing the closed set Fi to a point. Then Xi is a one-point compactification of Ui and hence homeomorphic to the n-sphere Sn.

Since the sequence (Fi) is decreasing, there are natural maps pji:Xj  →  Xi for j > i, and we get an inverse sequence (Xi) of n-spheres. Since the quotient maps p∞i:X∞  →  Xi separate points of X∞, the limit of this sequence can be identified with X∞.

The maps pji:Xj  →  Xi have at most one non-trivial point-inverse. According to Corollary [\ref=cor], they are near homeomorphisms. In virtue of Theorem [\ref=near], so is the map p∞0:X∞  →  X0. It follows that X∞ is homeomorphic to Sn. Hence X is homeomorphic to [formula].

Shrinkable decompositions and cellular sets

To make the paper more self-contained, we show how to deduce Theorem [\ref=cell] from Bing's Shrinking Criterion.

A decomposition of a set is a cover by disjoint subsets. If G is a decomposition of X, a subset of X is G-saturated if it is the union of some elements of G. A decomposition G of a compact Hausdorff space X is upper semicontinuous if one of the following equivalent conditions holds: (1) there exists a compact Hausdorff space Y and a continuous map f:X  →  Y such that G = {f- 1(y):y∈Y}; (2) the set [formula] is closed in X  ×  X; (3) for every closed subset F of X its G-saturation [formula] is closed. An upper semicontinuous decomposition G of a compact metric space X is shrinkable if for every ε > 0 and every cover U of X by G-saturated open sets there exists a homeomorphism h of X onto itself such that: (1) for every g∈G the set h(g) has diameter <  ε; (2) for every x∈X there exists U∈U such that x∈U and h(x)∈U.

Bing's Shrinking Criterion ([\cite=D], [\cite=vM]. An onto map f:X  →  Y between compact metric spaces is a near homeomorphism if and only if the decomposition {f- 1(y):y∈Y} of X is shrinkable.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=cell].

(1)  ⇒  (2). If F is a cellular set in a compact n-manifold M, the decomposition GF of M whose only non-singleton element is F is shrinkable. This easily follows from the fact that for every ε > 0 there exists a homeomorphism of the n-cube n onto itself which is identity on the boundary and shrinks the subcube n to a set of small diameter. Bing's Shrinking Criterion implies that the quotient map M  →  M / F is a near homeomorphism.

(2)  ⇒  (3) is trivial.

(3)  ⇒  (1). Suppose Sn / F is homeomorphic to Sn. We want to prove that F is cellular. Let U be an open neighbourhood of F. Denote the quotient map Sn  →  Sn / F by p. Let a∈Sn / F be the point onto which F collapses, p(F) = {a}. Then p(U) is an open neighbourhood of a. Since Sn / F topologically is a sphere, there exists a neighbourhood V of a such that V  ⊂  p(U) and the complement C of V is Sn / F is cellular. Then p- 1(C) is cellular in Sn (note that p restricted to [formula] is a homeomorphism). From the first part of the proof (implication (1)  ⇒  (2)) it follows that the complement of any cellular subset of Sn is homeomorphic to [formula]. Thus [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula], and it is an open neighbourhood of F which is contained in U. Since U was arbitrary, F is cellular.
