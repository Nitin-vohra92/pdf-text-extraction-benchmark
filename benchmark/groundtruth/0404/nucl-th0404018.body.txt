Abstract: The CEM2k and LAQGSM codes have been recently developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory to simulate nuclear reactions induced by particles and nuclei for a number of applications. We have benchmarked our codes against most available measured data at projectile energies from 10 MeV/A to 800 GeV/A and have compared our results with predictions of other current models used by the nuclear community. Here, we present a brief description of our codes and show illustrative results obtained with CEM2k and LAQGSM for A+p and A+A spallation, fission, and fragmentation reactions measured recently at GSI compared with predictions by other models. Further necessary work is outlined.

Introduction

During recent years, for a number of applications like Accelerator Transmutation of nuclear Waste (ATW), Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT), Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA), Proton Radiography (Prad), astrophysical work for NASA, and other projects, we have developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory an improved version of the Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM), contained in the code CEM2k, to describe nucleon-, pion-, and photon-induced reactions at incident energies up to about 5 GeV [\cite=CEM2k]-[\cite=fitaf] and the Los Alamos version of the Quark-Gluon String Model, realized in the high-energy code LAQGSM [\cite=LAQGSM], to describe both particle- and nucleus-induced reactions at energies up to about 1 TeV/nucleon [\cite=LAQGSM]-[\cite=Mashnik02d].

Both codes have been tested against most of the available data and compared with predictions of other modern codes [\cite=CEM2k]-[\cite=Mashnik02d]. Our comparisons show that these codes describe a large variety of spallation, fission, and fragmentation reactions quite well and often have a better predictive power than some other available Monte-Carlo codes, thus they can be used as reliable event generators in different applications and in fundamental nuclear research.

We have analyzed with CEM2k and LAQGSM all the A+p and A+A measurements done recently at GSI at energies near or below 1 GeV/nucleon for which we have results. The size of this paper allows us to present only a brief description of our models and a few results for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus spallation, fission and fragmentation reactions measured at GSI. Results for other reactions may be found in Refs. [\cite=CEM2k]-[\cite=Mashnik02d].

CEM2k and LAQGSM Codes

A detailed description of the initial version of the CEM may be found in [\cite=Gudima83], therefore we outline here only its basic assumptions. The CEM assumes that reactions occur in three stages. The first stage is the IntraNuclear Cascade (INC) in which primary particles can be re-scattered and produce secondary particles several times prior to absorption by or escape from the nucleus. The excited residual nucleus remaining after the cascade determines the particle-hole configuration that is the starting point for the preequilibrium stage of the reaction. The subsequent relaxation of the nuclear excitation is treated in terms of an improved Modified Exciton Model (MEM) of preequilibrium decay followed by the equilibrium evaporative final stage of the reaction. Generally, all three stages contribute to experimentally measured outcomes.

The improved cascade-exciton model in the code CEM2k differs from the older CEM95 version [\cite=CEM95] by incorporating new approximations for the elementary cross sections used in the cascade, more precise values for nuclear masses and pairing energies, a corrected systematics for the level-density parameters, adjusted cross sections for pion absorption on quasi-deuteron pairs inside a nucleus, the Pauli principle in the preequilibrium calculation, and an improved calculation of fission widths. Significant refinements and improvements in the algorithms used in many subroutines lead to a decrease of computing time by up to a factor of 6 for heavy nuclei, which is very important when performing simulations with transport codes. Essentially, CEM2k has a longer cascade stage, less preequilibrium emission, and a longer evaporation stage with a higher initial excitation energy, compared to its precursors CEM97 [\cite=CEM97] and CEM95 [\cite=CEM95]. Besides the changes to CEM97 and CEM95 mentioned, we also made a number of other improvements and refinements, such as: (i) imposing momentum-energy conservation for each simulated event (the Monte-Carlo algorithm previously used in CEM provided momentum-energy conservation only statistically, but not exactly for the cascade stage of each event), (ii) using real binding energies for nucleons at the cascade stage instead of the approximation of a constant separation energy of 7 MeV used in previous versions of the CEM, (iii) using reduced masses of particles in the calculation of their emission widths instead of using the approximation of no recoil used previously, and (iv) a better approximation of the total reaction cross sections. On the whole, this set of improvements leads to a much better description of particle spectra and yields of residual nuclei and a better agreement with available data for a variety of reactions. Details, examples, and further references may be found in [\cite=CEM2k]-[\cite=fitaf].

The Los Alamos version of the Quark-Gluon String Model (LAQGSM) [\cite=LAQGSM] is a further development of the Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) by Amelin, Gudima, and Toneev (see [\cite=Amelin90] and references therein) and is intended to describe both particle- and nucleus-induced reactions at energies up to about 1 TeV/nucleon. The core of the QGSM is built on a time-dependent version of the intranuclear-cascade model developed at Dubna, often referred in the literature simply as the Dubna intranuclear Cascade Model (DCM) (see [\cite=Toneev83] and references therein). The DCM models interactions of fast cascade particles ("participants") with nucleon spectators of both the target and projectile nuclei and includes interactions of two participants (cascade particles) as well. It uses experimental cross sections (or those calculated by the Quark-Gluon String Model for energies above 4.5 GeV/nucleon) for these elementary interactions to simulate angular and energy distributions of cascade particles, also considering the Pauli exclusion principle. When the cascade stage of a reaction is completed, QGSM uses the coalescence model described in [\cite=Toneev83] to "create" high-energy d, t, 3He, and 4He by final-state interactions among emitted cascade nucleons outside of the colliding nuclei. After calculating the coalescence stage of a reaction, QGSM moves to the description of the last slow stages of the reaction, namely to preequilibrium decay and evaporation, with a possible competition of fission using the standard version of the CEM [\cite=Gudima83]. If the residual nuclei have atomic numbers with A  ≤  13, QGSM uses the Fermi break-up model to calculate their further disintegration instead of using the preequilibrium and evaporation models. LAQGSM differs from QGSM by replacing the preequilibrium and evaporation parts of QGSM described according to the standard CEM [\cite=Gudima83] with the new physics from CEM2k [\cite=CEM2k] [\cite=CEM2kTsukuba] and has a number of improvements and refinements in the cascade, coalescence, and the Fermi break-up models (in the current version of LAQGSM, we use the Fermi break-up model only for A  ≤  12). A detailed description of LAQGSM and further references may be found in [\cite=LAQGSM] and in our later publications [\cite=Mashnik02a] [\cite=fitaf] [\cite=OurNewINC].

Originally, both CEM2k and LAQGSM were not able to describe fission reactions and production of light fragments heavier than 4He, as they had neither a high-energy-fission nor a fragmentation model. Recently, we addressed these problems [\cite=Mashnik02a]-[\cite=fitaf] by further improving our codes and by merging them with the Generalized Evaporation Model code GEM2 developed by Furihata [\cite=GEM2].

Our current versions of CEM2k and LAQGSM were incorporated recently into the MARS and LAHET transport codes and are currently being incorporated into MCNPX. This will allow others to use our codes as event-generators in these transport codes to simulate reactions with targets of practically arbitrary geometry and nuclide composition.

Illustrative Results

The Generalized Evaporation Model code GEM2 of Furihata [\cite=GEM2] merged with both our CEM2k and LAQGSM takes into account evaporation of up to 66 types of particles and light fragments (from n to 28Mg) from excited compound nuclei, while most other evaporation models used in the literature consider evaporation of only 6 types of particles, from n to 4He. It is interesting to see how important this is when analyzing the recent GSI A+p and A+A measurements. Fig. 1 gives us a quick and clear answer to this question: It is not important at all. We see that calculations by CEM2k+GEM2 taking into account up to 66 types of evaporated particles and fragments almost coincide with similar results calculated considering only 6 types of evaporated particles for all products measured recently at GSI [\cite=Rejmund01] for the reaction 800 MeV/A 197Au+p. Similar results were obtained for other GSI measurements. We do see a big difference between the results of these "66" and "6" calculations, but only for products with A  <  28 and Z  <  12, and such light products have not been measured at GSI. Note that the "66" calculations require about 7-8 times more computing time than the "6" ones. This means that if we study only spallation and fission products and are not interested in light fragments, we can consider evaporation of only 6 types of particles and save the computing time, getting results very close to the ones calculated with the more time consuming "66" option. But if we need to describe correctly all products from a reaction, including the light fragments, we will need to use the "66" option. All results presented below (and in previous publications) were obtained using the "66" option.
