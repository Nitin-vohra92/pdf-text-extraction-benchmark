Abstract. We prove some q-Identities related to overpartitions and divisor functions

Introduction

In this note, using the classical notations [formula], and [formula], we prove the following two identities :

For any pair positive integers m,n, one has

[formula]

[formula]

In the next section, we shall show that ([\ref=EQ1]) and ([\ref=EQ2]) can be obtained from the Newton interpolation in points [formula], using complete functions in the variables [formula].

Using the same methods, we have already given in [\cite=FuLa] an identity which generalizes the case x = 0 of ([\ref=EQ1]).

Given [formula], Newton gave the following interpolation formula, for any function f(x):

[formula]

where ∂i, acting on its left, is defined by

[formula]

Taking in particular f(x) = xn, we have

[formula]

where hk is the complete function of degree k, defined by

[formula]

Recall the following properties of hk:

The generating function of hk is:

[formula]

More generally, given two alphabets [formula] and [formula], then the generating functions of [formula] and [formula] are:

[formula]

As a consequence, one has:

[formula]

Given [formula], and a positive integer m, we have:

[formula]

Taking [formula], it is easy to check from ([\ref=Com]) and ([\ref=Gene]):

[formula]

Proofs of ([\ref=EQ1]) and ([\ref=EQ2])

The Gauss polynomials [formula] satisfy the following recursion (cf.[\cite=Andrews1]):

[formula]

In this paper, we need the following more general relations.

Let k, m and n be nonnegative integers. Then we have the following formulas:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof.   Taking [formula] and [formula], we obtain from ([\ref=gened]) and ([\ref=expan]):

[formula]

Letting f(m) be the left side of ([\ref=Pascal1]), then we have:

[formula]

[formula]

Taking [formula], [formula] and [formula], we get from ([\ref=gened]) and ([\ref=expan]), the proof of ([\ref=Pasz]):

[formula]

Taking

[formula]

and [formula] then we have,

[formula]

as stated in ([\ref=EQ1]).

Taking

[formula]

we have,

[formula]

[formula]

and this proves ([\ref=EQ2]).

Special Cases

In their study of overpartitions [\cite=CorLove], Corteel and Lovejoy obtained a combinatorial interpretation of the identity:

[formula]

Corteel asked us a proof of the following two related identities :

[formula]

and

[formula]

the first one becoming ([\ref=CortLovejoy]) for m = 1 and n =   ∞  , because

[formula]

In fact, ([\ref=Conje1]) is the special case of ([\ref=EQ1]) when x = 1.

Changing n into 2n, specializing x = 1 and z = q2, one gets from ([\ref=EQ2])

[formula]

Suppressing in the left member the term corresponding to i = 0, and taking into account that the right member of ([\ref=Conje2]) sums to 2q(1 - q2n)(1 - q4)- 1(1 - q2n + 1)- 1, one obtains ([\ref=Conje2]).

The case x = 0, m = 1 of ([\ref=EQ1]) is due to Van Hamme [\cite=Hamme] (see also [\cite=Andrews], [\cite=FuLa], [\cite=Uchimura]):

[formula]

Taking x = 0, and ([\ref=Pas]), we get the formula of Dilcher [\cite=Dilcher]:

[formula]

When x = 0 and z = qm in ([\ref=EQ2]), we get Uchimura's identity [\cite=Uchimura2]:

[formula]
