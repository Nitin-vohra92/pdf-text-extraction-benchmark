On topological properties of ultraproducts of finite sets

, Saharon Shelah

Introduction

In first order model theory the ultraproduct construction can be applied rather often. this is because ultraproducts preserve the validity of first order formulas. It is also natural to ask, what connections can be proved between certain higher order formulas and ultraproducts of models of them. In [\cite=cl1a] we answer related questions in terms of topological spaces which can be naturally associated to ultraproducts. These spaces are called ultratopologies and their definition can be found in [\cite=cl1a] and also at the beginning of [\cite=ut]. Although ultratopologies were introduced from logical (model theoretical) reasons, these spaces can be interesting on their own right. In [\cite=ut] a systematic investigation about these topological properties has been started. However, in [\cite=ut] some problems remained open. In the present note we are dealing with two such problems. In Section [\ref=hb] we give a positive answer for Problem 5.2 of [\cite=ut]: there are sequences of finite sets of pairwise different cardinalities such that their certain ultraproducts are still homeomorphic with respect to some carefully chosen ultratopologies. In fact, in Theorem [\ref=discr] below we show that if U is a good ultrafilter and A is any infinite ultraproduct of finite sets modulo U then there is an ultratopology on A in which the family of closed sets consists just the finite sebsets of A and the whole A. From this the affirmative answer for Problem 5.2 of [\cite=ut] can be immediately deduced. In Section [\ref=ds] we investigate the possible cardinalities of dense sets in ultratopologies, again on ultraproducts of finite sets. In Corollary [\ref=dc] we show that if C is any ultratopology on an infinite ultraproduct A then the density of C is smaller then |A|, that is, one can always find a dense set whose cardinality is less than |A|. Throughout we use the following conventions. I is a set and for every i∈I Ai is a set. Moreover A  =  Πi∈IAi  /  U denotes the ultraproduct of Ai's modulo an ultrafilter U. Every ordinal is the set of smaller ordinals and natural numbers are identified with finite ordinals. Throughout ω denotes the smallest infinite ordinal and cf denotes the cofinality operation. In order to simplify notation, sometimes we will identify [formula] with [formula] by the natural way, that is, k-tuples of sequences are identified with single sequences whose terms are k-tuples. If X is a topological space and A  ⊆  X then cl(A) denotes the closure of A. Suppose k∈ω, 〈Ai: i∈I〉 is a sequence of sets, U is an ultrafilter on I and [formula] is a given relation for every i∈I. Then the ultraproduct relation Πi∈IRi / U is defined as follows.

[formula].

As we mentioned, we assume that the reader is familiar with the notions of "choice function", "ultratopology", "a point is close to a relation", "T(a,R)", etc. These notions were introduced in [\cite=cl1a] and a short (but fairly complete) survey can be found at the beginning of [\cite=ut].

Homeomorphisms between different ultraproducts

In [\cite=ut] Problem 5.2 asks whether is it possible to choose ultrafilters U1, U2 and sequences of natural numbers s  =  〈ni, i∈I〉 and z  =  〈mj, j∈J〉 so that (i) [formula] for all i∈I,j∈J and (ii) for every k∈ω there are k-dimensional ultratopologies Ck in Πi∈Ini  /  U1 and Dk in Πj∈Jmj  /  U2 such that Ck and Dk are homeomorphic?

We will give an affirmative answer. In fact, we prove the following theorem from which the above question can be easily answered.

Suppose 〈ni, i∈I〉 is an infinite sequence of natural numbers and U is a good ultrafilter on I such that A  =  Πi∈Ini  /  U is infinite. Then for every k∈ω there is a k-dimensional choice function on A such that the family of closed sets in the induced ultratopology consists of the finite subsets of [formula] and [formula].

Let c be any k-dimensional choice function on [formula]. By modifying c, we will construct another choiche function [formula] which induces the required ultratopology. Let E be the set of all triples 〈s,i,m〉 where [formula], i∈I such that Πl∈Is(l)  /  U is infinite and [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula]. Therefore [formula]. Let {〈sα,iα,mα〉: α  <  2|I|} be an enumeration of E. By transfinite recursion we construct an injective function [formula] such that for every 〈s,i,m〉∈E one has f(〈s,i,m〉)∈Πl∈Is(l)  /  U. Suppose fβ has already been defined on {〈sα,iα,mα〉: α  <  β} for all β  <  γ  ≤  2|I| such that β1  <  β2  <  γ  ⇒  fβ1  ⊆  fβ2 and |fβ|  ≤  |β|. If γ is a limit ordinal, then let [formula]. Now suppose γ is a successor ordinal, say γ  =  δ  +  1. Since U is a good ultrafilter, by Theorem VI, 2.13 of [\cite=clasth] it follows, that the cardinality of B  =  Πl∈Is(l)  /  U is 2|I|. Therefore there is an element b∈B which is not in the range of fδ. Let fγ be [formula]. Clearly, f  =  f2|I| is the required function. Now we construct a k-dimensional choice function [formula] as follows. If [formula] then let â  =  c(a). Otherwise there is a unique e  =  〈s,i,m〉∈E such that f(e)  =  a. Let

[formula]

In this way we really defined a k-dimensional choice function on A. We claim that the closed sets of the induced ultratopology are exactly the finite subsets of [formula] and [formula]. By Theorem 2.5 of [\cite=ut] every ultratoplogy is T1 therefore every finite subset of [formula] is closed. Let F be an infinite closed subset of [formula] and suppose, seeking a contradiction, that there is an element

( * ) [formula].

By Corollary 2.2 of [\cite=ut] F is a decomposable relation, say F  =  Πl∈Is(l)  /  U. Therefore, there is a J∈U such that for every i∈J one has [formula]. Hence, for every i∈J ei  =  〈s,i,(i)〉∈E. By construction, for every i∈J one has f(ei)∈F and f(ei)(i)  =  (i). This means that

[formula].

That is, T(F,b)∈U (where T is understood according to the new choice function [formula]). Since we assumed that F is closed, this implies b∈F which contradicts to ( * ).

There are ultrafilters U1, U2 (respectively, over I and J) and sequences of natural numbers s  =  〈ni, i∈I〉 and z  =  〈mj, j∈J〉 so that (i) [formula] for all i∈I,j∈J and (ii) for every k∈ω there are k-dimensional ultratopologies Ck in Πi∈Ini  /  U1 and Dk in Πj∈Jmj  /  U2 such that Ck and Dk are homeomorphic.

Let U1,U2 be good ultrafilters and let s and z be arbitrary sequences of natural numbers satisfying the requirements of the corollary such that |I|  =  |J| and both A  =  Πi∈Isi  /  U1 and B  =  Πj∈Jzj  /  U2 are infinite. Let k∈ω be arbitrary. By Theorem [\ref=discr] there are ultratopologies Ck, Dk, respectively on A and B such that the closed sets of Ck are exactly the finite subsets of [formula] and [formula] and the closed sets of Dk are exactly the finite subsets of [formula] and [formula]. By Theorem VI, 2.13 of [\cite=clasth] |A| = |B|  =  2|I|. Let f:A  →  B be any bijection. Then [formula], f(〈a0,...,ak - 1〉  =  〈f(a0),...,f(ak - 1)〉 is clearly a bijection from [formula] onto [formula] mapping finite subsets of [formula] to finite subsets of [formula]. Thus, f is the required homeomorphism.

cardinalities of dense sets

Problem 5.3 (A) of [\cite=ut] asks whether is it possible to choose a sequence of finite sets s and an ultrafilter U so that there is an utratopology on A  =  Πi∈Ini  /  U in which every dense set has cardinality |A|. In this section we will show that this is impossible if A is infinite. We start by a simple observation: every k-dimensional ultratopology is homeomorphic with an appropriate 1-dimensional ultratopology.

Suppose Ck is a k-dimensional ultratopology on A. Then there is a 1-dimensional ultratopology D which is homeomorphic to C.

The idea is to identify k-tuples of sequences by sequences of k-tuples. By a slight abuse of notation, we will use this identification freely. Let A  =  Πi∈IAi  /  U (here the Ai's are not necessarily finite) and suppose [formula] is a k-dimensional choice function inducing Ck. Let [formula]. We define a 1-dimensional choice function c in B as follows. If s = 〈si:i∈I〉  /  U∈B then for each j∈k let sj  =  〈si(j): i∈I〉  /  U. Define c(s)  =  〈s0,...,sk - 1〉 and [formula], φ(〈s0  /  U,...,sk - 1 / U〉)  =  〈〈s0(i),...,sk - 1(i)〉:i∈I〉  /  U. Then clearly, c is a 1-dimensional choice function which induces an ultratopology D on B. Then for any [formula] and i∈I one has â(i)  =  c(φ(a))(i). Now it is straightforward to check that φ is a homeomorphism between C and D.

Let C be an ultratopology on an ultraproduct A  =  Πi∈Ini  /  U of finite sets. Suppose C can be induced by a choice function [formula]. Let

G  =  {〈i,m〉: i∈I,m∈ni and [formula]

and for each 〈i,m〉∈G let ai,m∈A be such that âi,m(i) = m. Clearly, if I is infinite, then |G|  ≤  |I|. We claim that there is a dense subset R of A such that |R|  ≤  |G|. In fact, R can be chosen to be R  =  {ai,m: 〈i,m〉∈G}. To see this, suppose a∈A. Then for every i∈I one has 〈i,â(i)〉∈G and therefore T(R,a)  =  I∈U. Hence cl(R)  =  A, as desired. Now we are able to provide a negative answer for Problem 5.3 (A) of [\cite=ut].

Suppose C is a 1-dimensional ultratopology on an infinite ultraproduct A  =  Πi∈Ini  /  U where each ni is a finite set. Then d(C)  <  |A|.

Suppose, seeking a contradiction, that C is an ultratopology on A such that the cardinality of every dense set in C is equal with |A|  =  κ. Using the notation just introduced in the remark before the theorem, R is a dense subset of A and therefore |R|  =  |A|. Let <  A be a well ordering of A (having order type κ). By transfinite recursion we define a sequence 〈bi∈A:i  <  κ〉 as follows. Assume j  <  κ and bl has already been defined for every l  <  j. Let Wj  =  {bl:l  <  j} and let Vj  =  {a∈A:T(Wj,a)∈U}. Since j  <  κ, [formula]. If j is an odd ordinal, then let bj be the <  A-first element of R - Wj. Otherwise let bj be the <  A-first element in A - Vj. Clearly, the following conditions are satisfied: (i) for every 〈i,m〉∈G there is a j  <  κ such that j(i)  =  m, in fact, R  ⊆  {bl: l  <  κ}  =  Wκ. (ii) for every a∈A there is a j  <  κ such that a∈Vj (the smallest such j will be denoted by ja), (iii) for every j  <  κ there is an ordinal j  <  s(j) such that s(j)  <  κ and [formula]. (This is true because otherwise by (i) one would have cl(Wj)  ⊇  cl(R)  =  A which is impossible since |Wj|  <  κ.) Now let H  =  {i∈I:ni  =  {j(i):j  <  κ}}. We show that H∈U. Again, seeking a contradiction, assume I - H∈U. For every i∈I - H let ei∈ni  -  {j(i):j  <  κ} be arbitrary, let e  =  〈ei:i∈I - H〉  /  U and let O  =  {i∈I:ê(i)  =  ei}. Clearly, O∈U. In addition, if [formula] then by (i) there is a j  <  κ such that j(i)  =  ê(i)  =  ei contradicting to the selection of ei's. For every i∈H we introduce a binary relation [formula] as follows. If n,m∈ni then [formula] means that there is a j∈κ such that j(i)  =  n but for every l  ≤  j [formula]. Clearly, for each i∈H the relation [formula] is irreflexive, transitive, and trichotome. Since ni is finite, for every i∈H there is an [formula]-maximal element yi∈ni. Let y  =  〈yi: i∈H〉  /  U and let K  =  {i∈I:ŷ(i)  =  yi}. Now by (ii) and (iii) y∈Vjy and [formula]. Thus, for every [formula] one has

[formula]

cl(Vjy) is closed, therefore there is L∈U such that for all i∈L one has [formula] and thus [formula] for every [formula] and for every l  <  jy. Particularly, ( * ) implies that if [formula] then [formula] which is impossible since by construction, yi is the [formula]-maximal element in ni. This contradiction completes the proof.

Using Theorem [\ref=dims] the above results can be generalized to higher dimensional ultratopologies as well.

Let k∈ω be arbitrary and suppose C is a k-dimensional ultratopology on an infinite ultraproduct A  =  Πi∈Ini  /  U where each ni is a finite set. Then d(C)  <  |A|.

Assume, seeking a contradiction, that C is a k-dimensional ultratopology on A whose density is |A|. Then, by Theorem [\ref=dims] there is a 1-dimensional ultratopology with the above property, contradicting to Theorem [\ref=maint]
