ABSTRACT

We have studied dijet production in γγ collisions with a view to probing the physics of large extra dimensions. The exchange of virtual spin-2 Kaluza-Klein excitations is found to modify the dijet cross-section substantially from its Standard Model value and allows the effective string scale to be probed to values between 2.5 and 6.4 TeV in the unpolarised case. In the case where the photons are polarised, the limits are seen to improve by roughly 20%. Dijet production in γγ collisions is thus shown to be a very effective probe of large extra dimensions.

There has been tremendous interest recently in the physics of large compact extra dimensions [\cite=dimo] [\cite=dimo2] [\cite=shiu] i.e. a number n of the dimensions of a higher dimensional string theory are compactified to a scale R which is very large compared to the Planck scale. The SM particles are confined to a 3-brane and do not see the effects of these dimensions. Only gravitons propagate in the bulk and so the the magnitude of R is constrained only by gravitation experiments. The constraints from the latter experiments are relatively weak [\cite=gravexp] and allow the extra dimension to be as large as 1 mm. After compactification, an effective theory of quantum gravity emerges, with the scale of the effective theory MS being of the order of a TeV. It is at these low energies of the order of 1 TeV that we will now expect to see the effects of quantum gravity. This very novel idea has far-reaching consequences : it is a possible solution to the heirarchy problem (though the latter manifests itself in a new garb). But, more interestingly, it is possible to make a viable scenario [\cite=dimo4] which can survive the existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints and predict other interesting consequences like low-energy unification [\cite=dienes] [\cite=kakushadze]. For some early papers on large Kaluza-Klein dimensions, see Ref. [\cite=anto] [\cite=taylor] and for recent investigations on different aspects of the TeV scale quantum gravity scenario and related ideas, see Ref. [\cite=related].

The low-energy effective theory that emerges below the scale MS [\cite=sundrum] [\cite=grw] [\cite=hlz], has an infinite tower of massive Kaluza-Klein states, which contain spin-2, spin-1 and spin-0 excitations. For low-energy phenomenology the most important of these are the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein states i.e. the infinite tower of massive graviton states which couple to the SM particles via the energy-momentum tensor, as usual. These couplings can lead to observable effects at present and future colliders. There have been several studies exploring these consequences. Production of gravitions giving rise to characteristic missing energy or missing pT signatures at e+e- or hadron colliders have been studied resulting in bounds on MS which are around 500 GeV to 1.2 TeV at LEP2 [\cite=mpp] [\cite=keung] and around 600 GeV to 750 GeV at Tevatron (for n between 2 and 6) [\cite=mpp]. Production of gravitons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in high-energy e+e- collisions at the Next Linear Collider (NLC) have also been considered. Virtual effects of graviton exchange in dilepton production at Tevatron yields a bound of around 950 GeV [\cite=hewett] to 1100 GeV [\cite=gmr] on MS, in t production at Tevatron a bound of about 650 GeV is obtained while at the LHC this process can be used to explore a range of MS values upto 4 TeV [\cite=us]. Virtual effects in deep-inelastic scattering at HERA put a bound of 550 GeV on MS[\cite=us2], while from jet production at the Tevatron strong bounds of about 1.2 TeV are obtained [\cite=us3]. Pair production of gauge bosons and fermions in e+e- collisions at LEP2 and NLC and in γγ collisions at the NLC [\cite=rizzo] [\cite=agashe] [\cite=soni] [\cite=davoudiasl] [\cite=lee] [\cite=ks] can probe values of MS from 0.5 TeV at LEP2 energies to several TeV at NLC. Virtual effects of gravitons [\cite=davoudiasl2] and real graviton production [\cite=gps] in eγ collisions have been shown to probe values of MS as high as 5 or 6 TeV. Other processes studied include associated production of gravitons with gauge bosons and virtual effects in gauge boson pair production at hadron colliders [\cite=balazs] [\cite=cheung] [\cite=eboli]. Higgs production [\cite=rizzo2] [\cite=xhe] and electroweak precision observables [\cite=precision] in the light of this new physics have also been discussed. Astrophysical constraints, like bounds from energy loss for supernovae cores, have also been discussed [\cite=astro].

In the present paper we study the effects of virtual graviton exchange in dijet production in γγ collisions at the NLC. The basic process is the Compton scattering of a low-energy laser beam of a well-determined frequency off a high energy electron beam [\cite=nlc], and the parameters of the photon-photon subprocess are fixed by controlling the electron and laser beam parameters. These experiments are planned over several steps of e+e- centre-of-mass energy spanning the range between 500 GeV and 1.5 TeV. Given the relatively clean initial state, very high precision is possible in these experiments and, indeed, the degree of precision can be enhanced by using polarised initial electrons and laser beams. Due to the reach in energy and the high precision, these experiments can test the SM very accurately and probe new physics that may lie beyond the SM. In particular, the NLC can be used very effectively to study the physics of large extra dimensions and it is with this aim that we study dijet production in γγ collisions at the NLC.

Since in the γγ scattering process, each γ is produced from the electron-laser Compton back-scattering, the energy of the back-scattered photon, Eγ, follows a distribution characteristic of the Compton scattering process and can be written in terms of the dimensionless ratio x = Eγ / Ee. It turns out that the maximum value of x is about 0.82 so that provides the upper limit on the energy accessible in the γγ sub-process. To get the full cross-section, the γγ subprocess cross-section is convoluted with the luminosity functions, fiγ(x), which provide information on the photon flux produced in Compton scattering of the electron and laser beams [\cite=lumino].

In the SM, dijet production in γγ collisions takes place via the usual t- and u-channel production mechanisms, γγ  →  q, where five massless flavours of quarks are summed over in the final state. In the presence of large extra dimensions, the γγ  →  q cross-section gets modified because of the s-channel exchange of virtual spin-2 Kaluza-Klein particles. In the following, we refer to this latter contribution as the non-SM (NSM) contribution. In addition to this, there is an entirely new NSM channel that opens up: γγ  →  gg. There is no SM contribution in this gg production channel, while in the q production channel the SM and the NSM contributions interfere. We calculate the cross-section for the polarised case and then obtain the unpolarised cross-section by summing over the polarisations of the initial photons .

The cross-section for the production of two jets in γγ collision can be written in terms of the transverse momentum, pT, and the rapidity, y, of one of the jets as follows:

[formula]

where the f(xi,ξ2i), i = 1,2 are the luminosity functions for each of the photons where ξ21 and ξ22 are the Stokes parameters of the first and second photons respectively, dσ̂(γγ  →  q) / dt and dσ̂(γγ  →  gg) / dt are the subprocess cross-sections for the q and gg channels respectively, and are given in terms of helicity amplitudes as follows:

[formula]

with the helicity amplitudes are given as:

[formula]

In the above equations, Mq(λ1,λ2) are the helicity amplitudes for the subprocess γγ  →  q and Mg(λ1,λ2) are those for the subprocess γγ  →  gg, with λ1 and λ2 denoting the polarisations of the first and the second photons, respectively.

The non-SM contribution involves two new parameters: the effective string scale MS and λ which is the effective coupling at MS. λ is expected to be of O(1), but its sign is not known a priori. In our work we will explore the sensitivity of our results to the choice of the sign of λ. Consequently, the only free parameter left is MS so that our results can be directly translated into quantitative predictions for the reach in MS.

We begin with the results for the unpolarised case. We have computed the unpolarised integrated cross-section for three different values of the initial e+e- C.M. energy i.e. [formula] GeV both for the SM and the NSM. In order to obtain the integrated cross-section, we have integrated the cross-section in Eq. [\ref=e1] over pT greater than a chosen pcutT and over all accessible values of y. From the value of the SM cross-section we derive the 2σ error band, assuming purely statistical errors and assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 fb[formula]. Comparing this with the NSM contribution (including the interference term in the q production channel), we obtain the 2σ limits on MS. These limits are displayed in Table 1, as a function of the e+e- centre-of-mass energy and pcutT. Stringent limits ranging from about 2.5 TeV at the lowest [formula] to about 6.4 TeV at the highest [formula] are obtained. Also we find that the bound that we obtain improves as we demand a larger value of pcutT. Given that the dijet cross-section is large, for a luminosity of 100 fb[formula] we get large event rates even for a pcutT of 60 GeV. The value of pcutT may thus be optimised so as to get a larger limit on MS, while still retaining a large number of dijet events.

We now discuss the results for the polarised case. As mentioned earlier, for a given choice of the initial electron and laser polarisations, the photon polarisation is fixed once the x value is known. The latter polarisation is therefore dependent crucially on the luminosity functions and it is only on the polarisation of the electron and the laser beams that we have a direct handle. At the level of the γγ subprocess, the helicity amplitudes directly reflect the dynamics of the SM and NSM. As can be seen from Eq. [\ref=e2], the amplitude where both photons have identical polarisation (λ1  =  λ2) vanishes for both the SM and the NSM. The helicity structure of the SM and the NSM contributions is similar to this extent, the differences between them coming only from the non-vanishing helicity amplitudes i.e. when the photons have opposite polarisation (λ1  =    -  λ2). For hard photons, the sign of λ is the same as that of the helicity of the initial electron. Therefore, λ1  =    -  λ2 is realised when the electron beams have opposite helicities i.e. (λe1  =    -  λe2). Further, the luminosity function is such that it peaks for a certain value of the product λeλl (where λl is the laser beam polarisation) in the high-x region. By scanning over the different choices of the laser beam and initial electron polarisation, we find that the best sensitivity is realised for the cases ( + , - , - , - ) and ( - , + , - , - ), where these represent the polarisations [formula]. In Table 2, we have displayed the limits on MS obtained with the first of these choices for the initial electron and laser beam polarisations. With this choice of polarisations, we find that the limits can improve by about 20% as compared to the unpolarised case.

In Fig. 1 we have plotted the rapidity distribution for [formula] TeV, in order to consider whether the use of differential quantities will further enhance the sensitivity of the process under consideration to the effects of the new physics. We find that the difference between the SM and the SM+  NSM distributions to be quite significant, especially when we concentrate in the central regions of rapidity. Though we refrain from making a quantitative estimate of the bound that would result (for such an estimate would be premature without knowing further experimental details), it is clear from Fig. 1 that the rapidity distribution can be used to improve the bound that would result from looking only at the integrated cross-section.

We have shown that virtual effects of spin-2 Kaluza Klein exchange can significantly affect dijet production in γγ collisions at the NLC and so this process can be used to probe the physics of large extra dimensions. The range of MS values that can be probed with this process is of the order of 2.5 - 6.5 TeV using the information on integrated unpolarised cross-sections. For the case of polarised photon beams, the sensitivity is enhanced by about 20%. Using differential informations, like rapidity distributions may help to further enhance the sensitivity of this process.
