THE SCALED UNIVERSE

*E-mail:birlasc@hd1.vsnl.net.in

Introduction

It has been argued by several authors[\cite=r1] [\cite=r2] [\cite=r3] [\cite=r4] [\cite=r5] [\cite=r6] that it is a Brownian process that underlies quantum behaviour and a fractal dimension of two for quantum paths. On the other hand the fractal nature of the macro universe has been noticed over the past several years [\cite=r7] [\cite=r8] [\cite=r9] [\cite=r10]. Indeed, this is obvious- matter is concentrated in atoms, stars and planets, galaxies, clusters and so on [\cite=r11] and not spread uniformly. Indeed, uniformity is dependant on the scale of observation or resolution. Not just that: the mysterious curiosity of a "cosmic" quantization has also been noticed[\cite=r3] [\cite=r12] [\cite=r13] [\cite=r14]. We will now show that the underlying connection between quantum type phenomena at different scales has a Brownian underpinning: there exists what may be called, a "Scaled Quantum Mechanics".

Scaling

We first observe that in Brownian motion we have[\cite=r15]

[formula]

where, for example Δx is the typical length of a step, n is the number of steps and x is the distance covered. We next observe that the following relations hold:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where N1  ~  106 is the number of superclusters in the universe, l1  ~  1025cms is a typical supercluster size N2  ~  1011 is the number of galaxies in the universe and l2  ~  1023cms is the typical size of a galaxy, l3  ~  1 light year is a typical distance between stars and N3  ~  1011 is the number of stars in a galaxy, R being the radius of the universe ~  1028cms,N  ~  1080 is the number of elementary particles, typically pions in the universe and l is the pion Compton wavelength. Equations ([\ref=e5]) and ([\ref=e1]) have been compared and it has been argued [\cite=r5] that this is symptomatic of quantum behaviour. Here, the Compton wavelength is a length scale within which we can find the corresponding mass. In this same spirit and in the light of the comments in Section 1, we can expect that equations ([\ref=e2]) to ([\ref=e4]) would also lead to a quantum type behaviour though, not at the micro scale represented by the pion (as in equation ([\ref=e5])) but rather at a suitable higher scale. Infact as we will now show, this is indeed the case with a scaled Planck constant given by

[formula]

for super clusters;

[formula]

for galaxies and

[formula]

for stars. Let us start with equation ([\ref=e5]). It is quite remarkable that ([\ref=e5]), (and a corresponding equation with the radius of the universe replaced by its age and the Compton wavelength replaced by its Compton time) can be deduced in a cosmological scheme in which elementary particles, typically pions are fluctuationally produced out of a background Zero Point Field[\cite=r16] [\cite=r17] [\cite=r18] [\cite=r19]. This scheme is consistent with astrophysical observations and also deduces from theory the various large number relations which were hitherto considered to be magical coincidences. Further, we have,

[formula]

where M is the mass of the universe and m the pion mass and N is defined in ([\ref=e5]). From ([\ref=e9]) and ([\ref=e5]) we can deduce,

[formula]

From ([\ref=e10]), we can easily deduce that there is the scaled Planck constant h1 given in ([\ref=e6]), such that,

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=e11]) shows that with this scaled constant h1, the radius of the universe turns out to be the counterpart of the Compton wavelength. Earlier it was argued[\cite=r20] [\cite=r21] that an electron could be modelled as a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with radius given by the Compton wavelength. It is interesting to note that this is also true for the universe itself with the scaled Compton wavelength: Infact in the case of the electron, the spin was given by

[formula]

where the domain of integration was a sphere of radius given by the Compton wavelength[\cite=r20] [\cite=r22]. If this is carried over to the case of the universe, with radius given by ([\ref=e5]) or ([\ref=e11]) and mass as in ([\ref=e9]) we get from ([\ref=e12])

[formula]

where h1 is as in ([\ref=e6]) and SU denotes the counterpart of electron spin. Infact the origin of h1 is in ([\ref=e13]): From this point of view, ([\ref=e6]) is not mysterious. In this case h1 turns out to be the spin of the universe itself in broad agreement with Godel's spin value for Einstein's equations [\cite=r23]. Incidentally this is also in agreement with the Kerr limit of the spin of the rotating Black Hole of mass given by ([\ref=e9]). Further as pointed out by Kogut and others, the angular momentum of the universe given in ([\ref=e13]) is compatible with a rotation from the cosmic background radiation anisotropy[\cite=r24]. Finally it is also close to the observed rotation as deduced from anisotropy of cosmic electromagnetic radiation as reported by Nodland and Ralston and others[\cite=r25]. We next use ([\ref=e3]), and the well known fact that [formula] [\cite=r26], along with the relation,

[formula]

which is the analogue of quantized angular momenta. It immediately follows that h22  =  G2m3Gl  ~  1074, which gives equation ([\ref=e7]). Further from ([\ref=e14]) it follows that

[formula]

which is consistent with the quantized large scale velocities that have been observed [\cite=r13]. Similarly taking the cue from ([\ref=e4]), if in conjunction with the well known Kepler type equation viz.,

[formula]

where mS is the mass of the sun, we use the counterpart of equation ([\ref=e14]) for the sun, can get the relation ([\ref=e8]), and then the planetary angular momentum, ~  nh3 gives correctly what may be called the BodeTitius type relation for the planetary distances. This was noted by Nottale, Agnese, Festa, Laskar, Carneiro and others[\cite=r3] [\cite=r14] [\cite=r12] and so will not be elaborated here. The above considerations not only provide a rationale for this behaviour, but also show how this fits into a more generalized scaling principle.

Discussion

(i) We have given a rationale for quantum like behaviour at large scales, expressed by equations ([\ref=e6]), ([\ref=e7]) and ([\ref=e8]). These express scales at the level of superclusters (and the universe), galaxies and stars. It may be mentioned that a hierarchical structure in the context of the now defunct strong gravity was considered by Caldirola and coworkers[\cite=r27]. (ii) We saw in Section 2 that the universe shows up as a black hole. Indeed this has been argued from an alternative view point (cf.ref.[\cite=r18]). Moreover, this is symptomatic of a holistic or Machian behaviour (cf.ref.[\cite=r3]). This infact has been the purport of earlier considerations (cf.refs.[\cite=r5] and [\cite=r19], for example). Moreover, this universal black hole could just be a scale expressing the upper limit of our capability to observe. In the spirit of reference [\cite=r17], there could be several such black holes or parallel universes. In this context, we may refer to the fact that in earlier work (cf. for example refs.[\cite=r17] and [\cite=r5]), a background zero point field (ZPF) or Prigogine's quantum vacuum was considered, our of which elementary particles, typically pions were fluctuationally created - the energy of the ZPF within the pion Compton wavelength being the rest energy of the pion. We could turn the perspective around and consider the creation of the universal black hole instead, at the scaled "Compton" wavelength of the universe, as given by equation ([\ref=e11]). It would then appear that the structure formation of the universe would be due to, as Mandelbrot pointed out, a curdling process (cf.ref.[\cite=r11] and [\cite=r28]). Indeed, we are prisoners of perspective: the following analogy would clarify. Let us consider the drawing on (two dimensional) paper of a (three dimensional) match box or rectangular parallelopiped. There are two rectangles - the outside rectangle and the inside one. Depending on which of these we start with, the match box would be either going inwards or coming outwards, two totally different possibilities. (iii) Given equations like ([\ref=e6]), ([\ref=e11]) and subsequent considerations of Section 2, it would be natural to expect the universe to be a "wave packet", though not in the spirit of Hawking[\cite=r29]. We can see that this is indeed so. Infact for a Gaussian wave packet[\cite=r30], we have,

[formula]

where, now, R and T denote the radius and age of the universe (at a given time), M its mass and σ  ~  R is the spread of the wave packet. Remembering that R  ≈  cT, ([\ref=e15]) actually reduces to equation ([\ref=e11])! The width of the wave packet is the "Compton" length. Differentiation of ([\ref=e15]) gives,

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=e16]) resembles Hubble's law. We can show that this is indeed so: Using ([\ref=e9]), and ([\ref=e13]), it follows from ([\ref=e16]) that,

[formula]

where the last equality has been deduced previously (cf.refs.[\cite=r16] [\cite=r17]) and can be easily verified. Not only does ([\ref=e17]) give the correct value of the Hubble constant, but it is also Weinberg's "mysterious" empirical relation (cf.ref.[\cite=r26]), giving the pion mass in terms of the Hubble constant or vice versa. Interestingly, from ([\ref=e15]), using again R  ≈  cT, we can deduce that

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=e18]) and ([\ref=e11]) are the analogues of Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle.
