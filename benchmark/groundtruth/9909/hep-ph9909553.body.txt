Triggered by the EMC experimental result [\cite=emc] on inelastic muon-proton scattering, there have been considerable discussions concerning the strangeness in hadron physics. Beginning with Kaplan and Nelson's work  [\cite=kaon1] on the charged kaon condensation the theory of condensation in dense matter has become one of the central issues in nuclear physics and astrophysics together with the supernova collapse. The K- condensation at a few times nuclear matter density was later interpreted [\cite=kaon2] in terms of cleaning of [formula]q condensates from the QCD vacuum by a dense nuclear matter and also was further theoretically investigated [\cite=kaon3] in chiral phase transition.

Quite recently, the SAMPLE collaboration[\cite=sample] reported the experimental data of the proton strange form factor through parity violating electron scattering[\cite=mck89]. On the other hand, McKeown[\cite=mck] has shown that the strange form factor of proton should be positive by using the conjecture that the up-quark effects are generally dominant in the flavor dependence of the nucleon properties. This result is contrary to the negative values of the proton strange form factor which result from most of the model calculations[\cite=jaffe] [\cite=musolf] [\cite=koepf] [\cite=park] except that of Hong and Park [\cite=hp] based on the SU(3) chiral bag model (CBM) and that of Meissner and co-workers [\cite=meissner].

Now let us consider the strange form factors of baryons in the chiral models, such as Skyrmion, MIT and chiral bag models with the general chiral SU(3) group structure. In these models, using the electromagnetic (EM) currents obtained from the model Lagrangian, the magnetic moment operator is given by the sum of isovector and isoscalar parts, [formula] where

[formula]

Here D8ab is the adjoint representation of SU(3) and Ĵi =  - T̂Ri (i = 1,2,3) and T̂Rp (p = 4,5,6,7) are the right SU(3) operators along the isospin and strangeness directions, respectively. M, N and [formula] are the inertia parameters obtained in the chiral symmetric limit and P and Q are the inertia parameters coming from the explicit current flavor symmetry breaking (FSB) effects in the adjoint representation where the chiral symmetry breaking mass terms cannot contribute to the magnetic moment operator.

Now, in order to take into account the missing symmetry breaking mass effects, we employ the quantum mechanical perturbative scheme where we use the SU(3) cranking and treat the symmetry breaking terms perturbatively. In this scheme, the Hamiltonian is split up into two pieces, the SU(3) flavor symmetric and symmetry breaking parts, H = H0 + HSB where

[formula]

Here M is the static mass of the baryon and I1 and I2 are the moments of inertia along the isospin and strangeness directions, respectively. Ĵ2 and C2(SU(3)) are the Casimir operators in the SU(2) and SU(3) group, Y2R the right hypercharge operator and m the inertia parameter denoting the symmetry breaking strength.

In the higher dimensional irreducible representation of SU(3) group, the baryon wave function is described as [formula] with the representation mixing coefficients CBλ, to yield the implicit FSB contribution to the magnetic moment

[formula]

Now the magnetic moments of baryon octet in the FSB case can break up into three parts

[formula]

where the first term μ0,B comes from the chiral symmetric contribution, δμ1,B is due to the explicit FSB and δμ2,B is obtained from the implicit FSB in the representation mixing as shown in Eq. ([\ref=delmu2]).

Following the above scheme we can obtain the proton magnetic moment

[formula]

Here one notes that the coefficients are solely given by the SU(3) group structure of the chiral models and the physical informations such as decay constants and masses are included in the inertia parameters.

Now one can easily see the spin symmetries as follows. First, in the adjoint representation of the SU(3) chiral symmetric limit with M, N and [formula], we have the U-spin symmetry, μ0,p  =  μ0,Σ+, μ0,n  =  μ0,Ξ0, μ0,Σ-  =  μ0,Ξ- and μ0,Λ =  - μ0,Σ0. Secondly, in the implicit representation mixing FSB contributions, we can obtain the V-spin symmetry relations, δμ2,p  =  δμ2,Ξ-, δμ2,n  =  δμ2,Σ- and [formula]. Finally, we can see that the s-flavor channel possesses the I-spin symmetry, [formula].

Using the flavor projection operators in the EM currents of the chiral models we can obtain the strange components of the nucleon magnetic moments, which are degenerate in the isomultiplets and respect the above I-spin symmetry

[formula]

On the other hand, the form factors of the baryons, with internal structure, are defined by the matrix elements of the EM currents

[formula]

where u(p) is the spinor of the baryons. Using the flavor projection operators in the EM currents as before, in the limit of zero momentum transfer, one can obtain the strange form factors of the baryons

[formula]

in terms of the strange quantum number of the baryon S and the strange components of the baryon magnetic moments. In Table 1, we obtain the chiral model predictions that the CBM with R  ≈  0.6 fm corresponding to θ(R) = π / 2 yield F(s)2p = 0.30 comparable to the experimental data [\cite=sample] F(s)2p = 0.23  ±  0.37  ±  0.15 (exp) within about 30% errors. Here one notes that the large positive values of the proton strange form factors originate from δF(s),12p (with P and Q) and F(s),22p (with mI2), the explicit and implicit FSB contributions due to fπ  ≠  fK, mπ  ≠  mK and mu = md  ≠  ms.

Now let us briefly review other model predictions. To the dispersion theory prediction[\cite=jaffe] F(s)2p =  - 0.31, the kaon loop correction is included[\cite=musolf] to yield F(s)2p =  - 0.40 where the SU(3) flavor symmetric baryon octet, for example mN = mΛ, is used. On the other hand, neglecting the sea-quark fluctuation effects, the nonrelativistic constituent quark model produces[\cite=koepf] F(s)2p =  - 0.0324. In the Skyrmion model, Park and collaborators[\cite=park] evaluates the proton strange form factor to yield F(s)2p =  - 0.13, which has the same sign but is much larger than our Skyrmion prediction due to the fact that they used the different Skyrmion parameter e = 4.0 and missed the contribution from the term proportional to f2K - f2π in the inertia parameter mI2. Very recently Meissner and co-workers[\cite=meissner] included the kaon loop corrections in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to yield F(s)2p = 0.18, which is positive also.

Similarly to the baryon octet case, one can obtain the magnetic moments of Δ baryons in the s-flavor channel

[formula]

Substitution of the above equation into Eq. ([\ref=f]) yields the strange form factors of Δ baryons whose numerical values are listed in Table 1, together with the predictions for the other octet and decuplet baryons.
