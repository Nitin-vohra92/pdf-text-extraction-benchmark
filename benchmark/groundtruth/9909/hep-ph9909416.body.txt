Each final state particle has energy greater than 10 GeV (including neutrino).

The transverse energy of each particle (including missing transverse energy) should be greater than 5 GeV.

The opening angle between two quark jets should be more than 20o.

Each final state particle should have the outgoing direction more then 10o away from the beam axis.
