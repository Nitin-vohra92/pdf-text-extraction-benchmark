Muon-catalyzed fusion in "warm-fusion"

1. We would like once more to consider Ref.[\cite=p1] in which a "warm" fusion effect on d - d nuclei was observed. The experiment was carried out in Broochyven National Laboratory (USA). A deuterated titanium plate TiD highly saturated with deuterium was bombarded by heavy water clusters (D2O)ND+ (further we shall denote them as (D2O)N) with energy 300 keV.

As at is seen from Ref.[\cite=p2] the results obtained are in a sharp contradiction to the standard concept of these processes. Attempts, made to explain the results of Refs.[\cite=p2], [\cite=p3] are unconvincing because they are aimed to reduce the experimental results to an old idea of fusion by macroparticles collision [\cite=p4].

In this paper we represent a fusion model operating within a system (D2O)N  -  TiD which enables one to explain the main peculiarities of the experiment [\cite=p1] in detail not using the idea mentioned above [\cite=p4].

2. Let us formulate the initial hypothesis which, from our point of view, is necessary to explain the experiment discussed :

g1. The output Noff of a fusion reaction (counting rate) is proportional to the deuterium concentration CD in the cluster (D2O)N (the D atoms concentration in the target is constant).

Hence, Noff  ~  CD  ~  N / V  ~  N / R3, where N is the number of D atoms in the cluster (D2O)N; R is the average radius of the cluster. Thus

[formula]

3. Hypothesis given above allows one to reproduce many peculiarities of the experimental data [\cite=p1] but two significant problems are still not clear:

why does a sharp change of fusion reaction behavior take place for N  ≈  110?

why does the number of deuterium "supplied" by clusters for the fusion reaction greatly decrease for N  >  500 (vanishing practically) ?

Moreover, the most important problem - why does the fusion reaction occur at all when the deuterium atoms possess such a relatively low energy (0.5...12keV)? - remains unsolved.

We think that to solve these problems we need the following postulate:

in a molecule D2O (in a cluster of heavy water (D2O)N) when its specific energy is of the order of 150eV one of the molecular bonds O  -  D is changed into O  -  Dμ i.e. a molecule D2O transforms into a muonic molecule.

4. Further considerations are sufficiently clear. First of all, we think that in the experiment [\cite=p1], the process of μ-catalyzed nuclear fusion reaction was observed. Let us take into consideration that the initial hypothesis g1 merely becomes one of the characteristics of the μ-catalyzed fusion (see for example Ref.[\cite=p5] ). In this case however the formula ([\ref=e01]) is to be represented in the form

[formula]

where k and B are constants. When the value of the output Noff of the fusion reaction is not so great, NoffB  ≪  1. Ionization energy of a muonic atom Dμ is to be equal to Tμ  =  206  To, where To is the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom. Hence, Tμ  =  2.8keV. This is exactly the same energy that muonic atom Dμ has in a cluster at N  =  107 (the cluster energy being equal to 300keV). Thus the processes, which occur in the experiment [\cite=p1], can be described in the following way:

for a small cluster size (N  =  25...110) the specific energy of cluster muonic atoms Dμ is greater than their ionization energy; there appears a sufficiently high local concentration of nuclei d and free μ-mesons in the target after its collision with the cluster and "destroying" the latter; afterwards the μ-catalyzed fusion reaction develops according to the standard scheme;

in large cluster (N  =  120...150) the specific energy of a muonic atom Dμ is not sufficient to ionize it; as a result the cluster "supplies" in the target not charged particles (d and μ) but neutral muonic atoms Dμ; probability of collisions between them is very small; hence, in this case, the fusion takes place mainly owing to collisions of muonic atoms Dμ with target nuclei d; consequently the relative concentration CD in comparison with light cluster sharply decreases.

Thus, we answered the first question of part 3 about causes of a threshold character of the fusion reaction at N  ≈  110. To answer the second question we note that maximal cluster size N at which the cluster still has energy for dissociation of a muonic molecular axis D2O (which moves so that its molecular axis O  -  D and the movement direction make angle ϑ ), can be calculated by the formula

[formula]

where TN is the cluster energy and Tdis is the dissociation energy of a muonic molecule D2O.

Unfortunately, the author doesn't know experimental value of the dissociation energy for a muonic molecule D2O, but one can evaluate this energy judging from the following considerations. For the molecule H2O the electron affinity is 0.9eV. Hence, for the muon the electron affinity is to be equal to 185 eV. Since, for dissociation of a muonic molecule D2O through the canal D2O  →  Dμ  +  DO the molecular bounding  maintained by a muon is to be broken. Because of it the dissociation energy of a muonic molecule D2O does differ from that of an ordinary molecule (i.e.5eV) by the 185eV value (the electron affinity for muon). Thus, Tdis  ≈  190eV.

Then from ([\ref=e03]) for T  =  300keV and ϑ  =  0 we obtain that N  =  1580. If we take into account the fact that according to the classical theory of molecular bounds the angle between molecular axis O  -  H in a water molecule is to be equal to [formula] then for To  =  300keV and [formula] we obtain the N  ≈  550. However orientation of different molecules D2O in a cluster toward the movement direction is likely to be rather random. Therefore in the range of N from 550 to 1580 the number of muonic molecules D2O of a cluster which energy is sufficient for dissociation is smoothly vanishing.

In conclusion we note that the statement expressed as a postulate in the part 3 is a quality result of the quantum theory interpretation, which is developed by the author in his previous paper (Refs.[\cite=p6]).
