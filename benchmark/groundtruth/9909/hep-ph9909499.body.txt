SUSYGEN3, AN EVENT GENERATOR FOR LINEAR COLLIDERS

SUSYGEN2 content and upgrades

Hopefully the linear collider would operate in an environment where a few sparticles would have been discovered and the high statistics will permit a precise study of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters [\cite=haberandkane]. One has therefore to move from a searches Monte Carlo to a "precision" physics Monte Carlo since one would need to measure accurately the above parameters. SUSYGEN2 [\cite=kats:susygen2] is a Monte Carlo event generator for the production and decay of supersymmetric particles and has been initially designed for e+e- colliders. It has been extensively used by all four LEP experiments to simulate the expected signals. It includes pair production of charginos and neutralinos, scalar leptons and quarks. It offers also the possibility to study the production of a gravitino plus a neutralino within GMSB models and the production of single gauginos if one assumes R-Parity to be broken All important decay modes of supersymmetric particles relevant to LEP energies have been implemented, including cascades, radiative decays and R-Parity violating decays to standard model particles. The decay of particles is done through the exact matrix elements. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) can either be the neutralino (01), the sneutrino ([formula]) or the gravitino ([formula]) in R-Parity conserving models, or there can be no LSP if R-Parity is violated. The initial state radiative corrections take account of pT  /  pL effects in the Structure Function formalism. QED final state radiation is implemented using the PHOTOS [\cite=was:photos] library. An optimized hadronization interface to JETSET [\cite=sjos:jetset] is provided, which also takes into account the lifetime of sparticles. Finally, a widely used feature of SUSYGEN2 is the possibility to do automatic scans on the parameter space through user friendly ntuples. Recently SUSYGEN2 has been upgraded to SUSYGEN3 [\cite=nous:susygen3] in order to adapt to the needs of the next generation of linear colliders, but also in order to extend its potential to supersymmetric particles searches at e-p colliders (e.g HERA) and hadronic colliders (e.g TEVATRON or LHC). The main new features relevant for linear colliders are the inclusion of beamstrahlung through an interface to CIRCEE [\cite=ohl:beamstrah], the full spin correlation in initial and final states, the inclusion of CP violating phases and the possibility to have an elaborate calculation of the MSUGRA spectrum through an interface to SUSPECT [\cite=djoua:suspect].

Beam polarization and spin correlations

Since one expects high luminosities for the next generation of linear colliders (e.g. ~  500fb- 1 for the TESLA project), one can use beam polarization to reduce the standard model backgrounds and use the polarization dependence of the cross sections to study specific SUSY parameters. Moreover, as it has been stressed by several authors [\cite=gudi:spincorr], spin correlations play a major role in the kinematic distributions of final particles. To fulfill these two requirements, the helicity amplitude method [\cite=mana:helicity] was used for the calculation of the different feynman amplitudes for production and decay, in order to obtain full spin correlation. Since such an amplitude involves products and contractions of fermionic currents, two basic functions, namely the B and Z functions were defined through:

[formula]

where Pλ stands for one of the two chiral projectors PL or PR and uλ(p,m) denotes the positive energy spinor solution of the Dirac equation for a particle of helicity λ, four momentum p and mass m. The decomposition of the bispinors uλ(p,m) in terms of the massless helicity eigenstates ωλ(k) yields analytic and easy to handle expressions for the B and Z functions. The amplitude is then factorized in terms of these basic building blocks; this fact permits compact and transparent coding and speed of calculation. The masses are not neglected in any stage of the calculation. For gaugino productions and decay, we use the widthless approximation. Let us illustrate it with, for instance, the calculation of the cross section associated to e+e-  →  0201  →  0101e+e-. The total amplitude associated to a given helicity configuration of the different particles is approximated by the product of the amplitude associated to the production of the two neutralinos (0201) with the amplitude corresponding to the decay of the next to lightest neutralino (02). The propagator squared of 02 is approximated by a factor given by 8π4 / (m02Γ02). The total amplitude expression is given by:

[formula]

The phase space integration is done through multichannel method [\cite=pittau]. The left side of figure [\ref=fig:beampolcorr], illustrates the effect of spin-correlations in angular distributions of decay electrons for the neutralinos case [\cite=spincorrtalks]. Recent studies [\cite=Nojiri:stau] have shown that τ polarization effects yield valuable information for the MSSM parameters e.g for tan β, the nature of the LSP and the mixing angle [formula]. That is why, we interfaced SUSYGEN3 to TAUOLA [\cite=was:tauola] which takes into account the τ polarization accurately in the decays. The large effects one expects, for the momenta of the decay distributions are shown on the right side of figure [\ref=fig:beampolcorr].

Including phases in supersymmetry searches

In the MSSM, there are new potential sources of CP non conservation[\cite=poko:phases]. Complex CP violating phases can arise from several parameters present in the MSSM Lagrangian: the higgs mixing mass parameter μ, the gauginos masses Mi, the trilinear couplings Ai. Experimental constraints on these CP violating phases come from the electric dipole moment of the electron and the neutron. Since all the couplings [\cite=rosi:coupling] and the different mass parameters μ, M1, and the trilinear couplings Aτ, At and Ab have been assumed to be complex by default, the introduction of phases in the gaugino and sfermion sector for masses as well for cross sections has been straightforward in SUSYGEN3. Figure [\ref=fig:phases] shows the chargino pair production cross section variations in terms of φμ, the phase associated to the μ parameter, for several values of the sneutrino mass me and for a value of tan β equal to 1. One sees that there is a local minimum between the two extreme values (Φμ = 0,180 degrees), by default examined at LEP searches, but also that it is not so deep as to raise doubts on the exhaustiveness of "phaseless" searches. On the contrary at the linear collider, one cannot neglect this strong dependence of the cross section from phases.

Future projects

Native C++ event generators are needed to optimize the couplings with linear collider simulation based on GEANT 4 and analysis tools. This will enable to share code and reuse classes between different generators. The helicity amplitude method and the two basic functions, namely the B and the Z functions, used to upgrade SUSYGEN seem to be optimally suited for object oriented implementation. Moreover, Multichannel integration looks well adapted for object treatment.
