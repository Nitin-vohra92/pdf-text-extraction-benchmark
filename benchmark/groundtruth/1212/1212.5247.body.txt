New techniques for chargino-neutralino detection at LHC

Introduction

The recent discovery of the Higgs boson, with a mass around 126 GeV [\cite=HiggsATLAS], [\cite=HiggsCMS], does not only have crucial importance by itself. It also has far-reaching consequences for well-motivated candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), such as Supersymmetry (SUSY), and in particular the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). As it is well known, such a value requires large radiative corrections, which go with (the logarithm of) the supersymmetric masses, in particular with the stop masses. Consequently, the latter must be rather high (well above 1 TeV unless the stop mixing is close to the maximal value), thus suggesting that the mass scale of SUSY particles could be substantially higher than expected from fine-tuning arguments. This would also make very challenging, if not impossible, to detect SUSY at LHC in a direct or indirect way. In fact, this is already the most likely situation for the constrained MSSM [\cite=Farina:2011bh] [\cite=Balazs:2012qc] [\cite=Akula:2012kk] [\cite=Buchmueller:2012hv] [\cite=Arbey:2012dq] [\cite=Strege:2012bt] [\cite=Cabrera:2012vu], i.e. assuming universality of soft terms at a high-scale.

Prospects become much more interesting if some supersymmetric states remain sufficiently light, which in general implies to go beyond the constrained MSSM. An attractive possibility in this sense is that charginos and neutralinos are substantially lighter than sfermions. This scenario is supported not only by the phenomenological fact that the present bounds on charginos and neutralinos are pretty mild. There are also some theoretical and phenomenological motivations to explore this possibility. Namely, the successful supersymmetric unification of the gauge couplings requires light supersymmetric fermions. Besides, heavy sfermions are welcome to suppress dangerous flavor-violation effects. Another motivation comes from dark matter (DM) constraints. The last data of XENON100 in combination with the Higgs mass have narrowed enormously the MSSM candidates for DM, see e.g. refs.[\cite=Farina:2011bh] [\cite=Cabrera:2012vu]. Probably the most satisfactory scenario that survives occurs when the lightest neutralino is almost pure Higgsino with a mass around 1 TeV. But if gaugino masses are not universal there are other possibilities. Namely, one can have a much lighter (mostly bino) neutralino which annihilates in the early universe through a combination of Z - boson and Higgs funnels, see [\cite=Farina:2011bh]. It can also co-annihilate with e.g. sleptons if their masses are close enough. Another alternative is that the LSP neutralino is mostly wino, in which case the co-annihilation with the lightest chargino becomes important.

In summary, a scenario where all the supersymmetric particles are too heavy, except charginos and neutralinos (and maybe gluinos), is plausible and has interesting motivations. Therefore it would be worthy to improve the present techniques to analyze the production and detection of chargino/neutralino pairs at the LHC; and this is the main motivation of this paper.

In most of the cases the chargino-neutralino pair created is χ±1χ02, i.e. the lightest chargino and the next-to-lightest neutralino. Some of the diagrams of production and decay are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:C1N2]. The chargino and the neutralino can decay in several ways, always giving an LSP (χ01) at the end of each cascade.

The study of chargino-neutralino pair production has been performed previously in e.g. [\cite=Aad:2012cwa], [\cite=Chatrchyan:2012ewa], [\cite=Aad:2009wy] through the analysis of leptonic final states. The aim of our work is to improve those analyses, by proposing new strategies which are complementary and more efficient in some cases . Our analysis is by construction independent of the diagrams through which the chargino and the neutralino decay, since it is entirely based on the properties of the final states. It can also be applied to final states including hadrons, such as [formula].

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section [\ref=sec:Art] we describe the present status of the analyses of possible chargino-neutralino production and detection, as done by ATLAS and CMS groups, and motivate the convenience of improving this kind of analysis. In section [\ref=sec:strat] we describe our strategy, by proposing a kinematical variable which allows to obtain direct information about the SUSY spectrum. It is also very useful to concentrate signal-events, thus improving the S/B ratio, and thus the LHC potential for discovery of new physics. Section [\ref=sec:Testing] is devoted to illustrate the use of this variable in concrete SUSY models. We finally conclude in section [\ref=sec:Concl].

State of the art of the analysis

As shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:C1N2], the neutralino χ02 can decay through a charged sfermion, a Higgs or a Z - boson, depending on the kinematical availability and the χ02 composition. Likewise, the chargino χ±1 can decay, among other channels, through a charged sfermion or a W - boson. However, as long as the sleptons are heavier than χ02 and χ±1, these decay channels become very suppressed and the decays through on-shell Higgs, Z and W dominate. Ref. [\cite=Aad:2012cwa] contains a study of purely leptonic final states of the type [formula], where [formula] and [formula] may be identical leptons. The authors perform separate analyses of two cases: 1) the invariant mass of identical opposite-sign leptons ([formula]) does not reproduce the Z-boson mass, MZ, and 2) it does. They assume that the χ02 decays through a slepton (case 1) or a Z - boson (case 2). In both cases, they use the EmissT variable to compare the actual experimental data with the SM background, finding no significant excess of events so far, once all the uncertainties are taken into account. The negative result is then interpreted as contour bounds in the parameter space of e.g. concrete simplified models.

A very complete analysis was presented later in ref.[\cite=Chatrchyan:2012ewa]. Again, the authors focus on 3-lepton final states, but using either the variable EmissT or [formula] in combination with MT (the transverse mass built with the momentum of the unpaired lepton) and EmissT. One option gives better sensitivity than the other, depending on the mass splittings between χ01 and its respective mothers. A second analysis was performed for 2-lepton final states, considering the possibility that one of the 3 leptons produced by χ±1 or χ02 may be lost or does not pass the kinematical cuts. In a last analysis they considered that both χ±1 and χ02 may decay through on-shell vector bosons, giving [formula] in the final state, for which the SM background has not intrinsic EmissT. Using these techniques they were able to provide contour bounds on χ±1,χ02 and χ01 masses for particular simplified models.

A quite efficient analysis of the decay through sleptons was presented in ref. [\cite=Aad:2009wy] (based on [\cite=Nojiri:1999ki] and [\cite=DeSanctis:2007td]), where the authors used the [formula] variable. An obvious advantage of this choice us that [formula] is Lorentz invariant and thus the analysis is fully valid in the (boosted) LAB frame. It can be shown that, when the intermediate sleptons are produced on-shell, the histogram on [formula] has an edge at a value given by a certain combination of the χ02,χ01 and [formula] masses[\cite=Nojiri:1999ki],[\cite=Gjelsten:2004ki],[\cite=Birkedal:2005cm]. This potentially gives a very distinctive experimental signal. When the sleptons are produced off-shell, the authors use a strategy based on the study of end-points in [formula]. This case is much less efficient, since by definition one has poorer statistics and a more difficult-to-control background.

In this paper we propose the use of a variable whose distinctive feature is to concentrate the signal events around a peak, not relying on end-points. It also provides direct information about the spectrum. Besides, it can be applied without any assumption or guess about the decay mode that takes place (through Z - boson, sleptons, Higgs or whatever). We describe the idea in the next section.

Our Strategy

The visible transverse energy

In contrast with the previous analyses, our strategy is purely kinematical and based only on the characteristics of the initial (χ02) and the final states (fχ01); so it is independent of the channel through which the χ02 decays. As it is based just on the χ02  -  chain, the analysis can be easily combined with other analyses that use partial information from both the χ02 and the χ±1 chains. It can also be applied to other processes where one or two χ02 states are produced.

We initially work in the reference frame in which χ02 is at rest, which we call CMχ (do not confuse with the center-of mass of the partonic collision) and consider the ET variable, defined as

[formula]

where ÊvT, ÊχT are the transverse energies of the the visible system (e.g. [formula]) and the missing system,

[formula]

Here Mv and Mχ are the invariant masses of the visible system and the LSP (χ01) and hats denote CMχ quantities everywhere. Of course, (p̂vT)2 = (p̂χT)2.

As it has been discussed in ref. [\cite=Cabrera:2012cj], the histogram of events displayed in the ET variable has a pole at the mass of χ02,

[formula]

Besides, for ET > M2 there are no events, so the histogram has an sharp edge at the pole. Hence, potentially, the ET variable can give a very distinctive signal, well separated from the background, providing in addition direct information about the SUSY spectrum. Note also that ET is invariant under longitudinal boosts. There are however some problems. First, even working at the CMχ frame, i.e. assuming that χ02 was produced with vanishing transverse momentum, we cannot measure the invisible transverse energy, EχT, due to the uncertainty on the value of Mχ. Actually, we have checked that in general Mχ≃0 is not a good approximation. Second, the χ02 neutralino is usually produced with a non-vanishing transverse momentum. We postpone the second issue to the next subsection and focus now on the first one.

In order to avoid the dependence on unknown quantities, a good strategy is to work just with the visible transverse energy, EvT, defined in eq.([\ref=ETdef]). It can be easily checked that the pole in the ET variable, eq.([\ref=ETpole]), translates into a pole in ÊvT,

[formula]

In general, the mass of the visible system, Mv, can change from event to event. However, if χ02 decays through a Higgs (very common case) or through a Z - boson, all the events are concentrated around Mv  =  mh (MZ). An example of this kind, which shows clearly the edge and pole in the CMχ frame can be seen in the plot a) of Fig.2, to be discussed below in more detail. When χ02 decays through sleptons, we can select a fraction of the events with similar Mv, and check that in CMχ a pole appears as in ([\ref=ETvpole]). This decreases the statistics but not in a dramatic way. Actually, in cases where M2v  ≪  M2χ2, one could do a histogram with all the events, since the pole appears then around [formula].

Next, we study what happens when we go from the CMχ to the actual LAB frame.

From CMχ to LAB

The clean and sharp behavior of the ÊvT variable in CMχ becomes of course less keen-edged when passing to the LAB frame. This is illustrated by the plots of Fig. [\ref=fig:ETvCMvsLAB]. They correspond to a CMSSM model with m0 = 500 GeV, M1 / 2 = 700 GeV, tan β = 10, A0 = 0, and μ > 0. The associated relevant spectrum for us is Mχ2  ≈  554 GeV and [formula] GeV. The χ02 neutralino decays almost entirely through an on-shell Higgs. In the CMχ frame the pole for EvT, eq. ([\ref=ETvpole]), is at [formula] GeV. We have simulated the events using Pythia, with a center-of-mass energy [formula] TeV and a luminosity of 20/fb. The upper (lower) plots of Fig.2 correspond to events where the Higgs decayed into τ (a pair of b-jets, jbjb). The left (right) plots are obtained in the CMχ (LAB) frame. We emphasize that this example is just for illustrative purposes. For this reason we have not incorporated a realistic τ-reconstruction, as well as b-jet identification.

As expected, the CMχ histograms show a very clear and sharp peak (pole) around 200-220 GeV, followed by an edge. In the case of the jbjb histogram there appear events beyond the edge due to the limited efficiency in the jet reconstruction. The corresponding LAB histograms show two (non-dramatic) differences. First, a logical spreading around the maximum; and second, a slight shift of the peak towards smaller values of EvT. This shift is almost invisible for the jbjb histogram. All these effects can be explained, estimated in a semi-analytical way and kept under control, as we discuss below.

We recall that the transverse variables we are using are only affected by transverse boosts when passing from CMχ to LAB. Longitudinal boosts are irrelevant for this analysis. There are two sources of transverse boosts. First, the partonic collision will not occur in general in its center-of-mass, i.e. it will have a non-vanishing net transverse momentum, typically due to initial state radiation. Second (and more importantly) even at the center-of-mass of the partonic collision, χ02 can be produced with non-vanishing transverse momentum (and opposite to that of χ±1) . Next we estimate the change in the EvT of the events at the pole due to the non-vanishing transverse momentum of χ02 in the LAB.

We will distinguish two perpendicular directions in the transverse plane: the direction along pχ2T ([formula]), and the perpendicular to it ([formula]). Due to the boost in the [formula] direction (we will ignore the boost in the longitudinal direction, which is irrelevant here), the visible energy changes (from CMχ to LAB) as

[formula]

where [formula] is the component of the visible 3-momentum in the [formula] direction. As usual, γ and β are the parameters of the Lorentz transformation, satisfying

[formula]

Now, for the events at the pole ÊvT  =  Êv in the CMχ frame [\cite=Cabrera:2012cj]. This holds after the transverse boost. Hence, when going to LAB, for those events the transverse energy of those events changes as in eq.([\ref=Ev]):

[formula]

which represents a shift

[formula]

Let us estimate the size of this shift. Since for a non-relativistic boost, [formula], the second term in the r.h.s. of ([\ref=DeltaETv]) will normally be the dominant one, because it scales with β instead of β2. However this term is sometimes positive and sometimes negative (depending on the sign of β), whereas the first term, which scales with β2, is always positive. On the other hand, in average, [formula]. Using eq.([\ref=ETvpole]) we can express p̂ vT as a combination of the masses involved in the system,

[formula]

This gets simplified when M2v  ≪  M2χ2, e.g. when the decay occurs via Higgs or Z - boson and also in the other cases if we select events with relatively small Mv. Therefore, at the pole

[formula]

which substituted back in eq.([\ref=DeltaETv]) gives

[formula]

We recall that this is expression is valid for events lying at the pole, which of course are especially interesting as they provide the maximum in the histogram of the signal. Now for a numerical evaluation of ΔÊvT we need to estimate βγ. In Fig. [\ref=fig:pTN2] we show a scatter plot of different SUSY models, showing the correlation between the transverse momentum of χ02 and its mass. As it can be checked from the fitting function, it is a good approximation to take, in average:

[formula]

This is illustrated in the right plot of Fig. [\ref=fig:pTN2] for a typical example. Actually this is consistent with expectations. First, the production of χ±1χ02 through a W in S-channel (see Fig.[\ref=fig:C1N2]a) is dominated by the resonance. Even though the W will be normally off-shell, the penalisation for large momenta of χ±1χ02 is important, although this reason becomes weaker for MW  ≪  Mχ2 + Mχ±1. Second, and more importantly, the PDFs penalize large energies. Since the final state particles are colourless (in this case charginos and neutralinos) with a net electric charge, they are essentially produced via quarks/antiquarks (and not gluons). This is significantly affected by the PDFs of the anti-quarks, which tend to prefer lower momenta rather than higher ones. As a consequence of these two effects, the energies of the particles at the final state are expected to be very close to their mass. This is consistent with the relation ([\ref=pTtipico]), which implies that the energy of the particle produced differs less than 5% from its mass. In consequence, from eq.([\ref=gammabeta], [\ref=pTtipico]) typically βγ≃1 / 3. Then eq. ([\ref=DeltaETv2]) becomes

[formula]

where we have already incorporated the fact that β has a random sign. This implies a shift in the range inthevisibletransverseenergyofthepoleeventswhengoingfromCMχtoLAB.Finally,wehavetoevaluatehowthismodifiesthepositionofthepeak.Noticethatthepoleeventsshiftedpositively(totherightofthehistogram),willnotproduceanynewglobalmaximumastheyfallinaregionofEwheretherewerealmostnoevents.Ontheotherhandthepoleeventsshiftednegatively(totheleftofthehistogram)willpopulatearegionwheretherewerealreadyevents.Inaddition,thatregiongetsalsopopulatedbypositiveshiftsofnon - poleevents,withlowerÊvalues.Consequently,weexpectamaximuminavalueofEwhichisapproximately18%smallerthanthevalueofthepoleinCMχ[formula]Ê|,givenbyeq.(),andtheactualpeakvalueoftheE-histogram,reconstructedforeachSUSYmodel.Theupper(lower)plotscorrespondtohistogramsofeventswheretheχneutralinosdecayedintoaτ-  (jj- )pairs.Weremarkagainthattheseplotsareshownforillustrativepurposesonly,sonoattemptofrealisticidentificationoftheτandb-jetsstatesisdoneatthislevel.Theleft(right)plotscorrespondtohistogramsintheCMχ(LAB)system.TheCMχplotsshowtheperfectcorrelationofthehistogrammaximumandthetheoreticalpole().TheLABplotsshowthetwoeffectsexpected:acertainspreadingandanetshiftoftheaveragemaximumwithrespecttotheCMχprediction.WehavefittedthepointsoftheLABplotswithsimplelinearfunctionsE=aE+b,getting(a,b) = (0.79.02,17), (0.86.04,22)fortheτandjjcases,respectively.NotethattheresultsforτeventsareconsistentwiththepreviouslydiscussedΔ Ê≃ -18%Êexpectation.Itisremarkable,however,thatforjjevents,theLABresultsaremoresymmetricallydistributedaroundtheCMχprediction.ThiscanbeeasilyunderstoodbyrecallingthatforjjeventstheCMχhistogramdoesnothaveanend - pointatthepolebecauseofthelimitedefficiencyinthejetreconstruction,seeplotc)ofFig.2.Inconsequencethediscussionaftereq.()getsnowmodifiedsincethepolejj-eventsshiftedpositivelyfallinaregionofEwheretherewerealreadyevents.Inconsequence,thelimitedefficiencyinthejetreconstructionfunnilymakesthepositionofthemaximummorestablethanfortheleptonichistogram;thusthesymmetricspreadingoftheLABscatter - plotaroundtheCMχprediction.OneofthemostinterestingfeaturesoftheEvariableisthatitconcentratesthesignaleventsaroundamaximum(determinedbythesupersymmetricspectrum),whichdoesnothappenforthebackgroundevents(thesegetconcentratedaroundM,seebelow).Thisbehaviourisveryhelpfultoseparatethesignaleventsfromthebackgroundevents,thusimprovingthesignal / background(S / B)ratiointhesearchofnewphysicsatLHC(evenbeforeusingthisvariabletoextractinformationabouttheSUSYspectrum).Itshouldbenoticedherethatthebackgroundevents(typicallySMproductionofWZ)behaveasifthe"neutralino"χhadexactlythemassoftheZ- bosonandthe"neutralino"χhadzero - mass.ThusforthebackgroundeventsthepeakintheEvariableliesat~ M.ForsomeSUSYmodels,however,thepositionofthemaximumofthesignal - determinedbyeq.() - canbeclosetoM,i.e.thepeakofEforbackgroundevents.Then,thestrategytodetecttheexistenceofnew - physicseventscanbefurtherimprovedbyplottingthepvariableratherthanE(ofcourse,bothvariablesareequivalentsincetheyareunambiguouslyrelatedthroughE = ,whereMisameasurablequantity).Notethatforthebackgroundevents,thepeakinpisnotfarfromthelowerkinematicalcutused,whileforthesignaleventsisgivenbyeq.(),andliesnormallyatsomenon - trivialvalue(evenifthecorrespondingEisclosetoM).Inthenextsectionwewillseesomeexplicitexampleswheretheuseofthepvariableisveryconvenienttoshowtheexistenceofnewphysicsinthefirstplace.Oncethenewphysicsisdetected,thevalueofp atthemaximumofthesignalcanberelatedtotheSUSYspectrumthrougheq.()orequivalentlythrougheq.().Nextweexplorethesefeaturesinfurtherdetail.

Testing the efficiency of EvT and pvT in concrete SUSY models

As we have described before, the chargino-neutralino pair production can be studied through the use of the visible transverse energy, EvT, regardless of the way the neutralino χ02 has decayed. So here we only care about initial and final states.

We will simulate LHC signals with [formula]14 TeV and luminosity of 100/fb, using the package SUSY-HIT [\cite=Djouadi:2002ze] [\cite=Muhlleitner:2003vg] [\cite=Djouadi:1997yw] [\cite=Djouadi:2006bz], as well as SOFTSUSY[\cite=Allanach:2001kg] for the spectrum calculators, and MadGraph /MadEvent [\cite=Alwall:2011uj] and PYTHIA[\cite=Sjostrand:2006za] for the event simulation. We focus on events with 3 leptons + missing transverse momentum, and apply the following general cuts

the existence of at least two identical, opposite signed leptons

the 3rd hardest lepton having ET  >  10 GeV

At least an electron (muon) with ET  >  25 GeV (pT  >  20 GeV)

3 leptons with pT > 20 GeV and η < 2.47 for electrons (η  <  2.4 for muons)

EmissT  >   50 GeV

The transverse mass of the 2nd chain MT > 90 GeV,

Jets pT  <  20 GeV

PGS ATLAS cuts [\cite=Alwall:2011uj]  .

The jet reconstruction is performed using the anti-kT algorithm with ΔR = 0.4, whereas the Initial State Radiation is simulated directly from the Matrix Element, with Parton Shower matching implemented by Madgraph/MadEvent by making use of MLM methods.

We illustrate our strategy by working in the context of the MSSM. Specifically we choose the following SUSY models (defined at the MZ scale)

[formula]

where M1,M2 are the bino and wino mass parameters at low-energy, and [formula] is the ratio between the VEVs of the two Higgs doublets. We do not specify the values of gluino and sfermion masses, which are assumed to be heavy (note that we are not imposing gaugino-mass unification). In the three models we study the signal of χ02 decaying through a Z - boson, which is the dominant one for all of them (more details below). The dominant background is WZ and WZ + jet production in the SM.

The strategy of the analysis for the three models is the following:

We reconstruct the possible invariant masses Mv of a pair of identical leptons, selecting the events where a pair of opposite-sign leptons has an invariant mass close to MZ

[formula]

This pair is identified as a daughter of a Z, thus the third lepton, [formula], should come from a W. This holds for both the signal and the SM background.

It is important to note that most of the WZ background events are actually removed thanks to the MT > 90 GeV requirement in the above list of cuts. The reason is the following. Taking into account that for the events of the background the missing momentum can be identified with the neutrino, one constructs the associated transverse mass, which satisfies the following inequality

[formula]

where [formula] is the charged lepton coming from the W (i.e. the unpaired lepton). Hence, identifying pmissT with pνT and discarding events with [formula] would in principle remove the whole WZ background. Although, due to the inefficiency in the reconstruction of the missing piece, some background events may violate in practice the inequality ([\ref=MTMW]). This turns out to be an extremely efficient constraint to improve the S/B ratio.

With the surviving events, we reconstruct the EvT, pvT variables associated to the lepton pair daughter of the Z.

We simulate the background taking into account only the contribution from WZ and WZ + jet production, which is by far the dominant one in the regions of interest (see e.g. [\cite=Aad:2012cwa]). We have checked that the results of our simulations are in agreement with [\cite=Aad:2012cwa].

Finally, we construct the EvT, pvT histograms to show the signal over the background.

Next we expound the results obtained for the three models considered, in a separate way.

Model 1

From the initial parameters listed in eq.([\ref=models]), we obtain the relevant supersymmetric spectrum for the analysis, which reads

[formula]

Since the staus are heavy, a priori the preferred decay channel of χ02 is through the lightest Higgs, mh = 126 GeV. However, since Mχ2  -  Mχ  <  mh, this channel is suppressed and the favourite decay-channel turns out to be through an on-shell Z. As mentioned above, the main background for this final-state topology is the SM production of a W / Z pair.

Fig.[\ref=fig:ETv_1] shows the histogram corresponding to the variable EvT, considering the background plus the signal with a luminosity of 100/fb, which will be reached in the near future. The SUSY signal is clearly visible. The position of its peak can be used to extract information about the SUSY spectrum in the way discussed in sect. 3. More precisely, for this model the prediction of eq.([\ref=ETvpole]) for the visible transverse energy at the pole of the signal is [formula] GeV, which is consistent with the bin of the histogram corresponding to the maximum signal, i.e. 90 ~ GeV - 110 GeV.

This case illustrates the possibility that the peak of the EvT  -  histogram for the signal lies close to the peak for the background, i.e. MZ. Note from Fig. [\ref=fig:ETv_1] that both peaks are at the same bin, as expected.

As discussed at the end of sect. 3, this feature can be improved by plotting pvT instead of EvT. The result is shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:pTv_1] (top-left plot). Note that the peak of the signal (the bin centered at 50 GeV) is now displaced with respect to the background one (the bin at 30 GeV), which represents a certain (though admittedly non-dramatic) improving. Fig.[\ref=fig:pTv_1] (top-right plot) shows the pvT  -  histogram of just the signal events. Of course, it is not something one can realistically obtain from the experiment but we present it in order to show the shape of the signal events, gathered around the (theoretically predicted) maximum.

For the sake of comparison we have presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:pTv_1] (bottom) the analogous plots for the missing momentum variable, pmissT, which is used in the experimental searches of ATLAS and CMS. The pvT variable turns out to be slightly better in the S/B ratio, showing that it can be at least as efficient as pmissT for the initial task of detecting the presence of new physics. Besides, in contrast with pmissT, the measure of pvT is direct and presumably less affected by systematic uncertainties. And, furthermore, once the presence of new physics is recognized, the pvT variable provides valuable information about its spectrum since the the maximum of the signal in is related to a defined combination of the supersymmetric masses, eq. ([\ref=pTvpole]).

Model 2 In this case the relevant supersymmetric spectrum reads

[formula]

χ02 and χ01 are almost pure bino and wino respectively. Now the decay of χ02 through an on-shell Higgs is kinematically allowed, so one would expect it to be the preferred decay channel. However, the branching ratio of the decays through a Higgs or through a Z - boson are 39% and 61% respectively. The reason is the following. Due to the relatively high value of tan β, the χ02 and χ01 neutralinos are essentially gauginos with a small H̃0d component and a very small H̃0u component. On the other hand, the physical Higgs-boson is essentially H0u for the same reason. Then the χ02 decay through a Higgs occurs thanks to those very small H̃0u components and gets suppressed, while the decay through a Z - boson may occur also through the not-so-small H̃0d components of the neutralinos.

Fig. [\ref=fig:ETv_2] shows the histogram corresponding to the variable EvT, containing the background plus the signal, again with a luminosity of 100/fb. The SUSY signal is of course weaker than in Model 1, since the supersymmetric masses are larger. On the other hand, it is nice that now the peak of the signal does not coincide with the peak of the background. In this case eq.([\ref=ETvpole]) gives [formula] GeV, consistent with what the signal peak visible at Fig. [\ref=fig:ETv_2].

As for Model 1, in this case the separation between the signal and background peaks is more efficiently achieved using the variable pvT rather than EvT, as it is shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:pTv_2] (top plots). We show also the analogous plots for pmissT. Again the behavior is slightly better for pvT, in particular in the region of higher statistics.

Model 3

Finally, for Model 3 the spectrum reads

[formula]

Again here χ02 and χ01 are almost purely wino and bino respectively, with very small Higgsino components of [formula]. Also in this case the neutralinos contain much more H̃0d than H̃0u, leading to branching ratios BR(χ02  →  χ01h) and BR(χ02  →  χ01Z) to be 4% and 96% respectively, for similar reasons as before. Since now tan β is much larger the Higgs channel is even more suppressed.

Fig. [\ref=fig:ETv_3] and Fig.  [\ref=fig:pTv_3] show the histograms in the EvT and the pvT,pmissT variables respectively. They show similar features as for Model 2. The difference of course is that the signal is now quite small due the large supersymmetric masses. Still it is visible, especially for the pvT variable. Since the S/B ratio is high (~  2) around the pvT-peak of the signal, the later would be visible with larger luminosities (say 300/fb).

Conclusions

The study of chargino-neutralino pair production at the LHC finds nowadays an unprecedented motivation, since the detection of those particles could well represent an opportunity of discovering light supersymmetric states at the LHC. Different strategies have been used so far by the experimental groups ATLAS and CMS to explore this process. They have been mainly focused on the analysis of 3-leptons plus missing-energy final states using standard kinematical variables, such as pmissT and the invariant mass [formula].

In this work, we have presented a new -purely kinematical- method based on the variable [formula], i.e. the transverse energy of the visible products coming from the neutralino (typically two leptons or two b-jets), which presents some very useful features. First of all, the histogram in EvT (in the frame where the decaying neutralino is at rest) has a pole. This translates into a peak in the actual experimental distribution. Consequently, this is a very robust feature against poor statistics. In addition, this concentration of signal-events around the maximum does not occur for the background-events. In this sense, it is highly advantageous to use, instead of EvT, the equivalent variable pvT (transverse momentum of the visible decaying products). This optimizes the S/B ratio, showing a (slightly) better performance than the usual pmissT variable. Furthermore, the main merit of the EvT or pvT variables is that the peak in the histogram is correlated in a well-defined way to a precise combination of SUSY masses, given by

[formula]

[formula]

where Mχ2, Mχ1 and Mv are the masses of the decaying neutralino χ02, the lightest neutralino (LSP) and the visible system to which χ02 decays to.

Of course, when passing from the CMχ to the LAB system the maximum becomes less sharp and the position of the maximum is slightly shifted. However, these effects are not dramatic and, besides, can be well estimated in a semi-analytical way and kept under control.

We have illustrated these facts performing a realistic analysis of particular SUSY models, where the χ02 neutralino decays mainly through a Z boson. We have focussed in events where the final state consists of 3 leptons plus missing energy, showing that the SUSY signal in the pvT variable could be very well detected at the LHC running with 14 TeV and a luminosity of 100/fb, which is attainable in the near future.

Let us finally stress that the same method can be applied to any possible decay channel of χ02: through squark, sleptons or a Higgs. The latter case is actually the most frequent one for MSSM models. Then, the most probable final state contains 2 b-jets, 1 lepton (or jet) and missing energy. The h  →  b channel has the additional advantage of having large branching ratios compared to the [formula] case. On the other hand, the topology [formula] is much less clean and difficult to reconstruct properly. Thus it requires a separate study which is out of the scope of the present paper and will be the subject of a future research work.
