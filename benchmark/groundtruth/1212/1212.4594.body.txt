Comment to the paper: 'Seeded quantum FEL at 478 keV' AIP Conf. Proc. 'Light at Extreme Intensities' 1462 173-176 (2012)'

In the paper [\cite=geuente], the Authors claim that a seeded quantum optical FEL driven by an electron beam at 125 MeV of energy, with current I=40 A, transverse dimension σx = 5 - 50μm and Twiss parameter [formula]cm, interacting with a laser beam at wavelength λL = 1μm and with a rather low laser parameter a0 = 0.03 can produce gamma rays at 478 keV with an expected spectral flux up to 1011eV- 1s- 1. The statements of this paper violate not only the physical laws, but also the common sense. The authors in fact base their estimates on an manipulated expression of the classical Pierce parameter ρ (that then appears in the expression for the quantum parameter , ruling the efficiency of their quantum FEL) given by[\cite=robbPP]:

[formula]

obtaining the value ρDiffr = 9  10- 5.

Unfortunately, they completely ignore that the previous formula is valid in cases of diffraction dominated FELs and derives from:

[formula]

where ρ is the usual 1D Pierce parameter (as defined for instance, in the paper by Ming-Xie [\cite=key-4]) and σrad the transverse dimension of the radiation.

As can be easily seen, eq. (2), when correctly used for diffraction dominated FELs, σrad  >  σx and consequently ρDiffr  <  ρ, translates the obvious consideration that diffraction can never strengthen the radiation, but only oppose to it.

In the case treated by [\cite=geuente], the radiation diffraction is completely negligible, due to the value of the radiation wavelength in the gamma rays range, and surely the Rayleigh length of the radiation is very much larger than the Twiss electron beta function, so that the usual expression of ρ must be used.

The usual 1D Pierce parameter ρ (see for instance, the paper by Ming-Xie [\cite=key-4]) with the same parameters of [\cite=geuente], in the most advantageous of their cases, gives:

[formula]

almost two orders of magnitude less than what they claim, changing completely the conclusions of their study.

An energy spread Δγ  /  γ of the order of 10- 3 or even 10- 4, in fact, does not satisfy one of the basic criteria for the lasing, i.e. [formula].

The production of brilliant X rays with optical FELs requires electron beams with current and brightness very much larger than those proposed in [\cite=geuente] as shown for instance in [\cite=key-5]or [\cite=key-6], and summarized in [\cite=key-7], with suitable emittances and energy spreads and laser energy.

In conclusion, the use of an expression of the Pierce parameter applied outside its validity range leads M. M. Guenther, D. Habs et al. to claim that it is possible to obtain a brilliant pulse of gamma rays with an optical FEL, contrarily instead to what found within a correct formulation of the problem.
