Statements and Dilemmas Regarding the [formula]-homology of Coxeter groups

Introduction

The following conjecture is attributed to Singer. For details on [formula]-homology theory, see [\cite=davismoussong], [\cite=do2] and [\cite=eckmann]. Now, let X be a geometric G-complex. A key feature of the [formula]-theory is that it is possible to attach to the Hilbert space Hi(X) a nonnegative real number, called the [formula] [formula]-Betti number. A formula of Atiyah states that the alternating sum of these [formula]-Betti numbers is the orbihedral Euler characteristic [formula], or in the case of a free action, the ordinary Euler characteristic χ(X / G). Thus, Conjecture [\ref=conj:singer] implies the following conjecture regarding Euler characteristic (attributed to H.Hopf):

Singer's conjecture holds for elementary reasons in dimensions ≤  2. Indeed, top-dimensional cycles on manifolds are constant on each component, so a square-summable cycle on an infinite component is constant 0. As a result, Conjecture [\ref=conj:singer] in dimension ≤  2 follows from Poincaré duality. In [\cite=LL], Lott and Lück prove that it holds for those aspherical 3-manifolds for which Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture is true. (Hence, by Perelman, all aspherical 3-manifolds.)

Let S be a finite set of generators. A Coxeter matrix on S is a symmetric S  ×  S matrix M = (mst) with entries in [formula] such that each diagonal entry is 1 and each off diagonal entry is ≥  2. The matrix M gives a presentation for an associated Coxeter group W:

[formula]

The pair (W,S) is called a Coxeter system. Denote by L the nerve of (W,S). In several papers (e.g., [\cite=davisannals], [\cite=davisbook], and [\cite=davismoussong]), M. Davis describes a construction which associates to any Coxeter system (W,S), a simplicial complex Σ(W,S), or simply Σ when the Coxeter system is clear, on which W acts properly and cocompactly. The two salient features of Σ are that (1) it is contractible and (2) it permits a cellulation under which the link of each vertex is L. It follows that if L is a triangulation of [formula], Σ is an n-manifold. There is a special case of Singer's conjecture for such manifolds.

In [\cite=do2], Davis and Okun prove that if Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] for right-angled Coxeter systems is true in some odd dimension n, then it is also true for right-angled systems in dimension n + 1. (A Coxeter system is right-angled if generators either commute or have no relation.) They also show that Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture holds for these Davis 3-manifolds arising from right-angled Coxeter systems. Hence, the Lott and Lück result implies that Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] for right-angled Coxeter systems is true for n = 3 and, therefore, also for n = 4. (Davis and Okun also show that Andreev's theorem, [\cite=andreev2], implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimension 3 for right-angled systems.) In [\cite=schroedergeom], the author geometrizes arbitrary 3-dimensional Davis manifolds and shows that Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimension 3 follows.

Right-angled Coxeter systems are specific examples of even Coxeter systems. We say a Coxeter system is even if for any two generators s  ≠  t, mst is either even or infinite. In [\cite=schroedereven], the author proves the following extension of the Davis-Okun 4-dimensional result:

The purpose of this paper is to generalize the methods used in [\cite=schroedereven] to any dimension. Following that template, we look at specific subspaces Ω of Σ called ruins (see [\ref=ss:ruins]). What follows is a similar, but much more complicated, statement to that proven by Davis and Okun in [\cite=do2]. For n = 2k we consider even Coxeter systems with flag nerves. We prove that Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimensions n - 2 and n - 1, along with the vanishing of the [formula]-homology of certain subspaces called "two-letter" ruins above dimension k + 1, implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimension n.

The Davis Complex

Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system. Denote by S the poset of spherical subsets of S, partially ordered by inclusion; and let [formula]. Given a subset V of S, let S< V: = {T∈S|T  ⊂  V}. Similar definitions exist for > ,  ≤  ,  ≥  . For any w∈W and T∈S, we call the coset wWT a spherical coset. The poset of all spherical cosets we will denote by WS.

The poset [formula] is an abstract simplicial complex, denote it by L, and call it the nerve of (W,S). The vertex set of L is S and a non-empty subset of vertices T spans a simplex of L if and only if T is spherical.

Let K = |S|, the geometric realization of the poset S. In K, simplices correspond to linearly ordered chains in the poset S. It is the cone on the barycentric subdivision of L, the cone point corresponding to the empty set, and thus a finite simplicial complex. Denote by Σ(W,S), or simply Σ when the system is clear, the geometric realization of the poset WS. This is the Davis complex. The natural action of W on WS induces a simplicial action of W on Σ which is proper and cocompact. K includes naturally into Σ via the map induced by T  →  WT, T∈S. So we view K as a subcomplex of Σ and note that it is a strict fundamental domain for the action of W on Σ.

For any element w∈W, write wK for the w-translate of K in Σ. Let w,w'∈W and consider [formula]. This intersection is non-empty if and only if V = S(w- 1w') is a spherical subset. In fact, [formula] is simplicially isomorphic to |S≥  V|, the geometric realization of S≥  V: = {V'∈S|V  ⊆  V'}.

A cubical structure on Σ.

For each w∈W, T∈S, denote by wS≤  T the subposet {wWV|V  ⊆  T} of WS. Put [formula]. |wS≤  T| has the combinatorial structure of a subdivision of an n-cube. We identify the sub-simplicial complex |wS≤  T| of Σ with this coarser cubical structure and call it a cube of type T. Note that the vertices of these cubes correspond to spherical subsets V∈S≤  T. (For details on this cubical structure, see [\cite=moussong].)

A cellulation of Σ by Coxeter cells.

Σ has a coarser cell structure: its cellulation by "Coxeter cells." (References for this cellulation include [\cite=davisbook] and [\cite=do2].) The features of the Coxeter cellulation are summarized by the following from [\cite=davisbook].

We will write Σcc, when necessary, to denote the Davis complex equipped with this cellulation by Coxeter cells. Under this cellulation, the vertices of Σcc correspond to cosets of [formula], i.e. to elements from W; and 1-cells correspond to cosets of Ws, s∈S. It will be our convention to use the term "vertices" for vertices in the cellulation of Σ by Coxeter cells or for vertices in L and to use "0-simplices" for 0-simplices in K or translates of K.

Ruins

The following subspaces are defined in [\cite=ddjo]. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system. For any U  ⊆  S, let S(U) = {T∈S|T  ⊆  U} and let Σ(U) be the subcomplex of Σcc consisting of all cells of type T, with T∈S(U).

Given T∈S(U), define three subcomplexes of Σ(U):

[formula]

The pair (Ω(U,T),∂Ω(U,T)) is called the (U,T)-ruin. For [formula], we have [formula] and [formula].

One-Letter Ruins.

Let t∈S. We call the (S,t)-ruin a one-letter ruin. Put U: = {s∈S|mst  <    ∞  }, i.e. U is the vertex set of the star of t in L. 1-cells in Ω(S,t) are of type u where u∈U. So two vertices w,v in a component of Ω(S,t), thought of as group elements of W, have the property that v = wp, where p∈WU. Thus, the path components of Ω(S,t) are indexed by the cosets W / WU. Denote by Ω the path-component of Ω(S,t) with vertex set corresponding WU. The action of WU on Σ restricts to an action on Ω. Put [formula] and note that the WU-translates of K(U) cover Ω, i.e. [formula]. Let [formula]. Coxeter 1-cells of ∂Ω(S,t) are of type u where u∈U - t; so the path components of ∂Ω are indexed by the cosets WU / WU - t.

Boundary collars.

If we restrict our attention to cubes of type T, where T  ⊆  T' for some T'∈S≥  t, Ω is a cubical complex and ∂Ω is a subcomplex. Moreover, if B is a component of ∂Ω, the space [formula] is isomorphic to the union of the w-translates of K(U) where w is a vertex of B. We call such subspaces boundary collars. It is clear that the collection of boundary collars covers Ω. We denote by ∂in(D) the end of this product which does not lie in ∂Ω; the 0-simplices of ∂in(D) correspond to elements of S≥  t. The boundary collars intersect along subsets of these "inner" boundaries.

Two-Letter Ruins.

For U  ⊆  S and T∈S(U) with [formula], we call the (U,T)-ruin a "two-letter" ruin.

Variations on Singer's Conjecture

In [\cite=do2], Davis and Okun present several variations of Singer's Conjecture for Coxeter groups (Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc]) in the case W is a right-angled Coxeter system. They then prove several implications regarding these statements including their proof that Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimension 2k - 1 implies [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimension 2k. We procede similarly, beginning with a restatement of Singer's Conjecture. The Roman numeral notation is to model that used in [\cite=do2] and [\cite=ddjo].

[formula] and [formula] are true.

Indeed, top-dimensional cycles on manifolds are constant on each component, so a square-summable cycle on an infinite component is constant 0. As a result, Conjecture [\ref=conj:singer] in dimension ≤  2 follows from Poincaré duality.

[formula] is true.

In [\cite=do2], the authors show that [formula] is true for right-angled Coxeter groups. In [\cite=schroedergeom], the author geometrizes arbitrary 3-dimensional Davis manifolds and shows that [formula] follows, Corollary 4.4, [\cite=schroedergeom].

Singer's Conjecture for Ruins

What follows are variations of [formula] for one-letter ruins, as definined in section [\ref=ss:ruins].

[formula] implies that Hi(∂Ω(S,t)) = Hi(Ω(S,t)) for [formula].

Consider the long exact sequence of the pair (Ω,∂Ω) = (Ω(S,t),∂Ω(S,t):

[formula]

[formula] implies the third term vanishes, for [formula]. The result follows from exactness.

The same proof applied to the long exact sequence of the pair (Ω(V,t),∂Ω(V,t)) proves the following.

Singer's Conjecture for two-letter ruins.

The following statement about two-letter ruins is needed for our program.

Implications

Excision Isomorphisms.

Now let V  ⊆  S, be arbitrary; T  ⊆  V spherical, Ω: = Ω(V,T), ∂Ω: = ∂Ω(V,T). Recall that Σ(V) is the subcomplex of Σcc consisting of cells of type T', with T'  ⊆  V. We have excision isomorphisms (as in [\cite=ddjo]):

[formula]

and for any s∈T and T': = T - s,

[formula]

Set [formula], and [formula]. Consider the long, weakly exact sequence of the triple (Σ(V),:

[formula]

By equations ([\ref=e:excision1]) and ([\ref=e:excision2]), the left hand term excises to the homology of the (V - s,T')-ruin, the right hand term to that of the (V,T)-ruin and the middle term to that of the (V,T')-ruin; leaving the sequence:

[formula]

[formula].

It is clear that Hi(Ω(V,t)) = 0 for [formula] whenever [formula], so we may assume that [formula]. We induct on [formula], [formula] giving us the base case. Let [formula] and t∈V'. Assume the result holds for V. If mst  =    ∞   then (Ω(V',t),∂) = (Ω(V,t),∂) and we are done. Otherwise, consider the sequence in equation ([\ref=e:ruinsequence]), taking T = {s,t}, T' = {t}:

[formula]

(where [formula] if n is even, [formula] if n is odd). Hi(Ω(V,t),∂) = 0 for [formula] by assumption and [formula] implies Hi(Ω(V,{s,t}),∂) = 0. So by exactness, Hi(Ω(V',t),∂) = 0 for [formula].

[formula].

Let V  ⊆  S and t∈V. Consider the following form of ([\ref=e:ruinsequence]), where T = {t}:

[formula]

(where [formula] if n is even, [formula] if n is odd). By [formula], Hi(Ω(V,t),∂) = 0 for [formula]. So by exactness,

[formula]

for [formula]. It follows that [formula] for [formula] and hence, by Poincaré duality, Hi(Σ) = 0 for [formula].

Even Coxeter systems

The Compbinatorics of Even systems

We present some of the background for the combinatorial arguments used in [\cite=schroedereven]. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system. Given a subset U of S, define WU to be the subgroup of W generated by the elements of U. (WU,U) is a Coxeter system. A subset T of S is spherical if WT is a finite subgroup of W. In this case, we will also say that the subgroup WT is spherical. We say the Coxeter system (W,S) is even if for any s,t∈S with s  ≠  t, mst is either even or infinite.

Given w∈W, we call an expression [formula] reduced if there does not exist an integer m < n with [formula]. Define the length of w, l(w), to be the integer n such that [formula], is a reduced expression for w. Denote by S(w) the set of elements of S which comprise a reduced expression for w. This set is well-defined, [\cite=davisbook].

For T  ⊆  S and w∈W, the coset wWT contains a unique element of minimal length. This element is said to be [formula]-reduced. Moreover, it is shown in [\cite=bourbaki], that an element is [formula]-reduced if and only if l(wt) > l(w) for all t∈T. Likewise, we can define the [formula]-reduced elements to be those w such that l(tw) > l(w) for all t∈T. So given X,Y  ⊆  S, we say an element w∈W is (X,Y)-reduced if it is both [formula]-reduced and [formula]-reduced.

Shortening elements of W.

We have the so-called "Exchange" (E) condition for Coxeter systems ([\cite=bourbaki] or [\cite=davisbook]):

(E) Given a reduced expression [formula] and an element s∈S, either [formula] or there is an index i such that

[formula]

In the case of even Coxeter systems, the parity of a given generator in the set expressions for an element of W is well-defined. (We prove this herein, Lemma [\ref=l:T-hom].) So, in (), si = s; i.e, if an element of s∈S shortens a given element of W, it does so by deleting an instance of s in an expression for w.

It is also a fact about Coxeter groups ([\cite=davisbook]) that if two reduced expressions represent the same element, then one can be transformed into the other by replacing alternating subwords of the form [formula] of length mst by the alternating word [formula] of length mst. The proof of the first of the following two lemmas follows immediately from this. The proof of the second depends on the first Lemma [\ref=l:onereduction] and may be found in [\cite=schroedereven].

Let (W,S) be an even Coxeter system, let t,s∈S be such that 2 < mst  <    ∞   and let Ust  =  {r∈S|mrt = mrs = 2}. Suppose that tstw' = wtv (both reduced) where w'∈W, w∈WS - t and [formula]. Then [formula].

Coloring the Davis Complex

Here and for the remainder of this section, we require that (W,S) be an even Coxeter system with nerve L. Fix t∈S and let [formula], and let Ω and ∂Ω be defined as in Section [\ref=s:davis]. The following is a generalization of the argument put forth in [\cite=schroedereven].

Any s∈U has the property that mst  <    ∞  . Let S': = {s∈U|mst > 2}, and assume that S' is not empty. The group WU has the following properties.

Suppose that s  ≠  s' and that mss'  <    ∞  . Then {s,s'}∈S, and since s,s' are both in U, the vertices corresponding to s, s' and t are pairwise connected in L. L is a flag complex, so this implies that {s,s',t}∈S. But

[formula]

This contradicts {s,s',t} being a spherical subset. So we must have that mss'  =    ∞  .

In other words, the generators from T - {s,t} commute with both s and t.

Links.

Now let Lst denote the link in L of the edge connecting the vertices s and t. The above Corollary states that the generators in the vertex set of Lst commute with both s and t. As in Lemma [\ref=l:reduction], denote this set of generators by Ust.

Of particular interest to us will be elements of WU with a reduced expression of the form [formula] for some s∈S'. Since W is even, this expression is unique, and we have the following lemma.

We show that gVT respects the relations in WV. Let s,u∈V be such that (su)m = 1. Then In all cases, since (WV,V) is even, gVT((su)m) = e.

Group Action on Cosets.

Then with T∈S≥  t and U as above, we define an action of WU on the set of cosets WT / WT - t: For w∈WU and v∈WT, define

[formula]

Painting vertices of Ω.

Set We call A the set of colors and note that it is a finite set. The action defined in equation ([\ref=e:action]) extends to a diagonal WU-action on A; for w∈WU and a∈A, write w  ·  a to denote w acting on a. Let ē be the element of A defined by taking the trivial coset WT - t for each T∈S≥  t. Vertices of Ω correspond to group elements of WU, so we paint the vertices of Ω by defining a map c:WU  →  A with the rule c(w): = w  ·  ē.

If an element w∈WU does not contain t in any reduced expression, then w acts trivially on the element ē, i.e. w  ·  ē  =  ē.

Painting boundary collars.

We paint the space wK(U) with c(w). In this way, all of Ω is colored with some element of A. For vertices w and w' of the same component B of ∂Ω, h = w- 1w'∈WU - t, so c(w') = c(wh) = wh  ·  ē = w  ·  ē = c(w), where the third equality follows from Remark [\ref=r:trivial]. Therefore all of the boundary collar containing w is painted with c(w). Note that each component of ∂Ω is monochromatic while the interior of Ω is not.

Suppose, by way of contradiction, that [formula], i.e. there exist vertices w∈B, w'∈B' such that c(w) = c(w') and [formula]. Let V = S(v), where v = w- 1w', and since w and w' are from different components of ∂Ω, t∈V. Now c(w) = c(w')  ⇒  w  ·  ē = wv  ·  ē  ⇒  ē = v  ·  ē. Thus, for any T∈S≥  t, we have that

[formula]

But since v∈WV, the action of v on WV / WV - t defined in ([\ref=e:action]) is left multiplication by v. But by equation ([\ref=e:h]), we have that v∈WV - t; a contradiction.

c-collars.

Now for c∈A, define the c-collar, Fc, to be the disjoint union of the boundary collars [formula] where each component B of ∂Ω has the color c. The collection of c-collars, for all colors c, is a finite cover of Ω.

Even and odd collars

Let T = {t} and consider the homomorphism gUT:WU  →  Wt defined in Lemma [\ref=l:T-hom]. Under gUT, an element w∈WU is sent to the identity in Wt if w has an even number of t's present in some factorization (and therefore, all factorizations) as a product of generators from U and an element w∈WU is sent to t∈Wt if w has an odd number of t's present in factorizations. Thus, we call a vertex w even if gUT(w) = e; odd if gUT(w) = t. If two vertices w and w' are such that c(w) = c(w'), then clearly gUT(w) = gUT(w'), so we may also classify the colors as even or odd. A c-collar is even or odd as c is even or odd and we refer to it as an "even or odd collar."

We will be employing a Mayer-Vietoris argument using the collars as individual pieces of the union. So, of fundamental importance will be how these collars intersect. By Remark [\ref=r:trivial], we know that in order for the vertices of a Coxeter cell to support two different colors, this cell must be of type T∈S≥  t. But, for a cell to support two different even vertices, v and v', this cell must be of type T∈S≥  {s,t} for exactly one s∈S' (uniqueness is given by Corollary [\ref=c:commute]). Moreover, w = v- 1v' has the properties that (1) {s,t}  ⊆  S(w) and that (2) it contains at least two, and an even number of t's in any factorization as a product of generators. Such a w we call t-even.

The intersection of even collars.

Now let L be a flag triangulation of [formula], so that Σ is an n-manifold. Let D0 denote the boundary collar containing the vertex e. Fix s∈S' and let D2 denote the boundary collar containing the vertex u, where u∈W{s,t} is t-even and has a reduced expression ending in t. We study [formula].

For any w∈W', the vertex w is in the same component of ∂Ω as e (by Remark [\ref=r:trivial]), and therefore wK(U)  ⊂  D0. wu = uw, so wu is in the same component of ∂Ω as u and wuK(U)  ⊂  D2. Thus [formula].

Now let σ be a 0-simplex in [formula]. Then there exist w,w'∈WU - t such that [formula], i.e. σ is simultaneously the w- and uw'-translate of a 0-simplex σ' in K(U). Let V be the spherical subset to which σ' corresponds and let v∈WV be such that uw' = wv. c(e) = c(w) and c(u) = c(uw'), so w and uw' are differently colored even vertices of a Coxeter cell of type V. By the second paragraph of [\ref=ss:evenodd], {s',t}  ⊆  S(v)  ⊆  V for exactly one s'∈S' and v is t-even.

Claim 1: s' = s. Pf: Since w'∈WU - t, c(u) = c(uw') = c(wv), i.e. u and wv act the same on every coordinate of ē. Consider the {s,t}-coordinate. u∈W{s,t} is t-even, so u  ·  Ws = uWs and uWs  ≠  Ws. But if s∉S(v), then v being t-even and w∈WU - t imply that wv  ·  Ws = Ws; which contradicts u and wv having the same color. So Claim 1 is true, and as a result V∈S≥  {s,t} and σ'∈K'. Moreover, by Corollary [\ref=c:commute], [formula]. It remains to show that σ is in the W'-orbit of K'.

Claim 2: [formula]. Pf: Take a reduced expression for u which ends in t. If this expression begins with s, multiply u on the left by s, so that we have suw' = swv. The only change this can effect on S(w) is either adding or subtracting an s, which is inconsequential to our claim. So, we may assume that u has a reduced expression of the form [formula] as described in Lemma [\ref=l:XY-reduced]. Hence, u is (U - t,U - t)-reduced and uw' has a reduced expression beginning with the subword tst. wv has a reduced expression of the form w''tv' where w''∈WU - t, [formula] and where the difference between S(w) and S(w'') is contained in [formula]. Claim 2 then follows from Lemma [\ref=l:reduction] applied to w''.

We now finish the proof of Lemma [\ref=l:W'-orbit]. If s∉S(w), then w∈W' and we are done since σ is the w-translate of σ'. If s∈S(w), then w may be written as qs, with q∈W' and since s∈V, qsWV = qWV. So σ is also the q-translate of σ'.

[formula], an infinite connected (n - 2)-manifold.

Since S(u) = {s,t}, K' is the geometric realization of the poset S≥  {s,t}  =  {V∈S|{s,t}  ⊆  V}. By Lemma [\ref=l:W'-orbit], [formula], and by Corollary [\ref=c:commute], S≥  {s,t} is isomorphic to S(Ust) via the map T  →  T - {s,t}. So [formula].

Recall that Lst denotes the link in L of the edge connecting s and t. Simplices in Lst correspond to spherical subsets T∈S such that neither s nor t is contained in T but [formula]. So by Corollary [\ref=c:commute], the vertex set of a simplex of Lst corresponds to a spherical subset of S(Ust). Conversely, given a spherical subset T∈S(Ust), [formula], which is finite. So T corresponds to a simplex of Lst. Thus, Lst is the nerve of the Coxeter system (W',Ust). Since L triangulates [formula], Lst triangulates [formula]. It follows from Proposition [\ref=p:coxeter] that Σ(W',Ust) is a contractible (n - 2)-manifold.

Suppose that Fc  ≠  Fc' are both even collars and [formula]. Then there exist even vertices v and v' with [formula]. Let w = v- 1v' and put T = S(v- 1v'). T is a spherical subset, and v and v' are both vertices of a cell of type T. So we have exactly one s∈S' with {s,t}  ⊆  T. Factor w as w = xq where x∈W{s,t} is t-even and q∈WT - {s,t}. Now, x may not have a reduced expression ending in t. If it does not, then xs does and it is in the same boundary collar as x and w. So let

[formula]

Then [formula]. Act on the left by v- 1 and we are in the situation studied in Lemma [\ref=l:W'-orbit] and Proposition [\ref=p:W'-Daviscpx]. So [formula] is the disjoint union of infinite connected 2-manifolds.

If W is right-angled, or if [formula], then WU = WU - t  ×  Wt and there is one even and one odd collar. This is why all the effort on the colors....because the ruins have branching points.

Multiple even collars.

Suppose that [formula] are even boundary collars. Then and suppose that for some 1  ≤  i < k  ≤  n we have that [formula] and [formula] are not disjoint. Let σ be a 0-simplex contained in [formula] corresponding to a coset of the form vWT. Then there exists w,w'∈WT such that v∈De, vw∈Di, vw'∈Dk and [formula]. These three vertices are differently colored even vertices of a cell of type T, so {s,t}  ⊆  T for exactly one s∈S' and both w and w' are t-even. Then, as in the proof of Corollary [\ref=c:2evens], it follows that [formula]. As a result, Corollary [\ref=c:2evens] generalizes to the following:

Odd collars.

We now consider how the odd collars intersect with the entire collection of even collars.

Since Fo is a disjoint union of boundary collars, it suffices to show that [formula] for some boundary collar D  ⊂  Fo.

(⊇  ): Let σ be a 0-simplex in ∂in(D). Then σ corresponds to a coset of the form wWV where V∈S≥  t and w∈WU is an odd vertex of D. Consider the even vertex wt. Then since t∈V, wWV = wtWV, and σ∈wtK(U)  ⊂  FE.

(⊆  ): Now suppose that σ is a 0-simplex contained in [formula]. Then there exists a spherical subset V and cosets wWV = w'WV where w is odd and w' is even. Let v = w- 1w'. Since w is odd and w' is even, v must contain an odd number of t's in any of its reduced expressions. Therefore t∈V and σ∈∂in(D).

As before, let FE denote the union of all even collars, and now let FO denote the union of a sub-collection of odd collars. Let [formula] and let Fo be an odd collar not included in FO. Then by Lemma [\ref=l:oneodd], Any 0-simplex in Fo which is also in a different collar must be of the form wWV, where w is a vertex of Fo and V∈S≥  t. Therefore [formula] and [formula].

It is clear from the product structure on boundary collars that [formula], the latter a disjoint collection of components of ∂Ω. Since L is flag, we have a 1-1 correspondence between Coxeter cells of any component of ∂Ω and cells of Σ(WU - t,U - t)cc. Denote by Lt the link in L of the vertex corresponding to t, it is a triangulation of [formula] and it is isomorphic to the nerve of (WU - t,U - t). So we have the following corollary.

Inductive arguments in the case (W,S) is even

Consider the following restatements of conjectures [formula], [formula] and [formula], each in the case that (W,S) is even and L is a flag triangulation of [formula]. (Here the "E" stands for even, the "F" for flag.)

A version of [formula] is proven in [\cite=schroedereven], which only requires showing the top dimensional [formula]-homology vanishes and the proof of which only requires the nerve L being flag. So, the proof given in [\cite=schroedereven] does generalize to the following "top-dimensional only" version of [formula]. Note that the following shows that [formula] is true, and in fact, we can also drop the even hypothesis.

Let n  ≥  3 and (W,S) be a Coxeter system whose nerve L is flag triangulation of [formula]. Then Hn(Ω(V,T),∂Ω(V,T)) = 0.

If [formula], then Ω(V,T) does not contain n-dimensional cells, and we are done. So assume that [formula]. The codimension 1 faces of n-cells of Ω(V,T) are either faces of one other n-cell in Ω(V,T) (Σ is an n-manifold), or they are free faces, i.e they are not faces of any other n-cell in Ω(V,T).

Suppose that cells of type T'∈S(V)(n)> T have a co-dimension one face of type R which is a face of another n-cell in Ω(V,T) of type T''. Then any relative n-cycle must be constant on adjacent cells of type T' and T'', where [formula], and [formula], R∈S(V)(n - 1)> T and r,s∈V. Since L is flag and (n - 1)-dimensional, mrs  =    ∞  . So in this case, there is a sequence of adjacent n-cells with vertex sets [formula]. Hence, this constant must be 0.

Now suppose that for a given n-cell of Ω(V,T), every co-dimension one face is free. This cell has faces not contained in ∂Ω(V,T), so relative n-cycles cannot be supported on this cell.

Note the importance of [formula] to this program, as you see in Theorem [\ref=t:newmain] below. If a generalized version of this could be proved, then the program would move forward to prove further cases of Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc].

Inductive Arguments

We now generalize the steps used in [\cite=schroedereven], presenting inductive arguments on the painted Davis Complex as a partially successful program to prove [formula]. Since the proofs of Proposition [\ref=p:one-letter] and Theorem [\ref=t:Singer] do not depend on the even nor odd hypotheses, the same proofs give us the following.

For [formula], [formula].

It suffices to calculate [formula]. We first show that Hn(Ω,∂Ω) = 0. Consider the long exact sequence of the pair (Ω,∂Ω):

[formula]

Ω is an n-dimensional manifold with infinite boundary, so Hn(Ω) = 0 and Hn - 1(∂Ω) = 0. Then by exactness, Hn(Ω,∂Ω) = 0.

Now, let [formula] and let FE' denote the union of a collection of even collars or the union of all evens and a collection of odd collars. Let Fc be a collar not contained in FE' where if FE' is not all the even collars, require that Fc be an even collar. Let [formula] and let [formula]. Note that [formula] and consider the relative Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the pair [formula]:

[formula]

Assume that Hi - 1(FE',∂E') = 0. Each color retracts onto its boundary, so Hi(Fc,∂Fc) = 0. If Fc is even, then the last term vanishes by Corollary [\ref=c:2evens] and [formula] and since [formula], if Fc is odd, then the last term vanishes by [\ref=c:oddn-1], [formula] and since for n even, [formula] implies [formula]. In either case, exactness implies that [formula]. It follows from induction that H3(Ω,∂Ω) = 0.

Note that if n is odd, then with these hypotheses we are unable to guarantee the vanishing of the [formula] term for odd colors Fc. However, if we knew the inclusion map of the intersection of the painted boundary collars into the direct sum in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence was injective, we wouldn't need both dimensional statements. Since this "even-flag" argument is pretty technical, I am usure of the most general statement that can be made.

It is known that [formula] and [formula] are true and therefore the more specific statements [formula] and [formula] are true. The purpose of [\cite=schroedereven] is to prove that [formula] is true. This is done in a manner exactly like that spelled out above, including the fact that [formula] is true. Thus the main result of [\cite=schroedereven] is generalized by the following statement.

[formula].

By Proposition [\ref=p:even1ruin], the first two hypotheses give us that know that [formula] is true. Then, along with [formula], this implies that [formula] is true (see [\ref=sss:evenone-letter]). Finally, by [\ref=sss:evenSinger], we can conclude that [formula] is true.
