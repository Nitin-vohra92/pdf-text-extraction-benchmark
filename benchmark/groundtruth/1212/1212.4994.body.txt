Amalgamated free product type III factors with at most one Cartan subalgebra

Introduction and main results

A Cartan subalgebra A in a von Neumann algebra M is a unital maximal abelian [formula]-subalgebra A  ⊂  M such that there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation EA:M  →  A and such that the group of normalizing unitaries of A inside M defined by NM(A)  =  {u∈U(M):uAu*  =  A} generates M.

By a classical result of Feldman and Moore [\cite=feldman-moore], any Cartan subalgebra A in a von Neumann algebra M with separable predual arises from a countable nonsingular equivalence relation R on a standard measure space (X,μ) and a 2-cocycle [formula]. Namely, we have the following isomorphism of inclusions

[formula]

In particular, for any nonsingular free action [formula] of a countable discrete group Γ on a standard measure space (X,μ), [formula] is a Cartan subalgebra in the group measure space von Neumann algebra [formula].

The presence of a Cartan subalgebra A in a von Neumann algebra M with separable predual is therefore an important feature which allows to divide the classification problem for M up to [formula]-isomorphism into two different questions: uniqueness of the Cartan subalgebra A inside M up to conjugacy and classification of the underlying countable nonsingular equivalence relation R up to orbit equivalence.

In [\cite=connes-feldman-weiss], Connes, Feldman and Weiss showed that any amenable countable nonsingular ergodic equivalence relation is hyperfinite and thus implemented by an ergodic [formula]-action. This implies, together with [\cite=Kr75], that any two Cartan subalgebras inside an amenable factor are always conjugate by an automorphism.

The uniqueness of Cartan subalgebras up to conjugacy is no longer true in general for nonamenable factors. In [\cite=CJ81], Connes and Jones discovered the first examples of II1 factors with at least two Cartan subalgebras which are not conjugate by an automorphism. More concrete examples were later found by Popa and Ozawa in [\cite=OP08]. We also refer to the recent work of Speelman and Vaes [\cite=SV11] on II1 factors with uncountably many non (stably) conjugate Cartan subalgebras.

In the last decade, Popa's deformation/rigidity theory [\cite=Po01] [\cite=popa-malleable1] has led to a lot of progress in the classification of II1 factors arising from probability measure preserving (pmp) actions of countable discrete groups on standard probability spaces and from countable pmp equivalence relations. We refer to the recent surveys [\cite=Po06b] [\cite=Va10a] [\cite=ioana-ecm] for an overview of this topic.

We highlight below three breakthrough results regarding uniqueness of Cartan subalgebras in nonamenable II1 factors. In his pioneering article [\cite=Po01], Popa showed that any rigid Cartan subalgebra inside group measure space II1 factors [formula] arising from rigid pmp free ergodic actions [formula] of the free group [formula] (n  ≥  2) is necessarily unitarily conjugate to [formula]. In [\cite=OP07], Ozawa and Popa proved that any compact pmp free ergodic action of the free group [formula] (n  ≥  2) gives rise to a II1 factor [formula] with unique Cartan decomposition, up to unitary conjugacy. This was the first result in the literature proving the uniqueness of Cartan subalgebras in nonamenable II1 factors. Recently, Popa and Vaes [\cite=PV11] proved that any pmp free ergodic action of the free group [formula] (n  ≥  2) gives rise to a II1 factor [formula] with unique Cartan decomposition, up to unitary conjugacy. We refer to [\cite=OP08] [\cite=Ho09] [\cite=CS11] [\cite=CSU11] [\cite=PV12] [\cite=houdayer-vaes] [\cite=Io12a] for further results in this direction.

Very recently, using [\cite=PV11], Ioana [\cite=Io12a] obtained new results regarding the Cartan decomposition of tracial amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras [formula]. Let us highlight below two of Ioana's results [\cite=Io12a]: any nonamenable tracial free product [formula] has no Cartan subalgebra and any pmp free ergodic action [formula] of a free product group [formula] with |Γ1|  ≥  2 and |Γ2|  ≥  3 gives rise to a II1 factor with unique Cartan decomposition, up to unitary conjugacy.

In the present paper, we use Popa's deformation/rigidity theory to investigate Cartan subalgebras in nontracial amalgamated free product (AFP) von Neumann algebras [formula] over an amenable von Neumann subalgebra B. We generalize some of Ioana's recent results [\cite=Io12a] to this setting. The methods of proofs rely on a combination of results and techniques from [\cite=PV11] [\cite=houdayer-vaes] [\cite=Io12a].

Statement of the main results

Using his free probability theory, Voiculescu [\cite=Vo95] proved that the free group factors [formula] (n  ≥  2) have no Cartan subalgebra. This exhibited the first examples of II1 factors with no Cartan decomposition. This result was generalized later in [\cite=Ju05] to free product II1 factors [formula] of diffuse subalgebras which are embeddable into Rω. Finally, the general case of arbitrary tracial free product von Neumann algebras was recently obtained in [\cite=Io12a] using Popa's deformation/rigidity theory.

The first examples of type III factors with no Cartan subalgebra were obtained in [\cite=Sh00] as a consequence of [\cite=Vo95]. Namely, it was shown that the unique free Araki-Woods factor of type IIIλ (0  <  λ  <  1) has no Cartan subalgebra. This result was vastly generalized later in [\cite=houdayer-ricard] where it was proven that in fact any free Araki-Woods factor has no Cartan subalgebra.

Our first result settles the question of the absence of Cartan subalgebra in arbitrary free product von Neumann algebras.

Observe that when dim M1  =   dim M2  =  2, the free product [formula] is hyperfinite by [\cite=Dy92] and so has a Cartan subalgebra. Note that the questions of factoriality, type classification and fullness for arbitrary free product von Neumann algebras were recently settled in [\cite=ueda-advances]. These results are used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmA].

We next investigate more generally Cartan subalgebras in nontracial AFP von Neumann algebras [formula] over an amenable von Neumann subalgebra B. Even though we do not get a complete solution in that setting, our second result shows that, under fairly general assumptions, any Cartan subalgebra A  ⊂  M can be embedded into B inside M, in the sense of Popa's intertwining techniques. We refer to Section [\ref=preliminairies] for more information on these intertwining techniques and the notation [formula]. Recall from [\cite=houdayer-vaes] that an inclusion of von Neumann algebras P  ⊂  M has no trivial corner if for all nonzero projections [formula], we have Pp  ≠  pMp.

A similar result was obtained for tracial AFP von Neumann algebras in [\cite=Io12a].

The first examples of type III factors with unique Cartan decomposition were recently obtained in [\cite=houdayer-vaes]. Namely, it was shown that any nonamenable nonsingular free ergodic action [formula] of a Gromov hyperbolic group on a standard measure space gives rise to a factor [formula] with unique Cartan decomposition, up to unitary conjugacy. This generalized the probability measure preserving case that was established in [\cite=PV12].

In order to state our next results, we need to introduce some terminology. Let R be a countable nonsingular equivalence relation on a standard measure space (X,μ) and denote by [formula] the von Neumann algebra of the equivalence relation R ([\cite=feldman-moore]). Following [\cite=adams], we say that R is recurrent if for all measurable subsets U  ⊂  X such that μ(U)  >  0, the set [formula] is infinite for almost every x∈U. This is equivalent to saying that [formula] has no type I direct summand. We then say that a nonsingular action [formula] of a countable discrete group on a standard measure space is recurrent if the corresponding orbit equivalence relation [formula] is recurrent.

Our next result provides a new class of type III factors with unique Cartan decomposition, up to unitary conjugacy. These factors arise from countable nonsingular ergodic equivalence relations R which split as a free product [formula] of arbitrary recurrent subequivalence relations. We refer to [\cite=Ga99] for the notion of free product of countable nonsingular equivalence relations.

Observe that Theorem [\ref=thmC] generalizes [\cite=Io12a] where the same result was obtained for countable pmp equivalence relations under additional assumptions. Note that in the case when R1 is nowhere amenable, that is, [formula] has no amenable direct summand and R2 is recurrent, Theorem [\ref=thmC] is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thmB] and [\cite=houdayer-vaes]. However, Theorem [\ref=thmB] does not cover the case when both R1 and R2 are amenable. So, in the setting of von Neumann algebras arising from countable nonsingular equivalence relations, Theorem [\ref=thmC] is a generalization of Theorem [\ref=thmB] in the sense that we are able to remove the nonamenability assumption on [formula].

Finally, when dealing with certain nonsingular free ergodic actions [formula] of amalgamated groups [formula], we obtain new examples of group measure space type III factors with unique Cartan decomposition, up to unitary conjugacy.

Observe that Theorem [\ref=thmD] generalizes the probability measure preserving case that was established in [\cite=Io12a].

In the spirit of [\cite=houdayer-vaes], we obtain the following interesting consequence. Let [formula] be an arbitrary free product group such that Γ1 is amenable and infinite and |Γ2|  ≥  2. Then we get group measure space factors of the form [formula] with unique Cartan decomposition, having any possible type and with any possible flow of weights in the type III0 case.

We finally mention that, unlike the probability measure preserving case [\cite=Io12a], the assumption of recurrence of the action [formula] for all i∈{1,2} is necessary. Indeed, using [\cite=SV11], we exhibit in Section [\ref=non-uniqueness] a class of nonamenable infinite measure preserving free ergodic actions [formula] of free product groups [formula] such that the corresponding type II ∞  group measure space factor [formula] has uncountably many non conjugate Cartan subalgebras.

Comments on the proofs

As we already mentioned above, the proofs of our main results rely heavily on results and techniques from [\cite=PV11] [\cite=houdayer-vaes] [\cite=Io12a]. Let us describe below the main three ingredients which are needed. We will mainly focus on the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmA].

Denote by [formula] an arbitrary free product of von Neumann algebras as in Theorem [\ref=thmA]. For simplicity, we may assume that M is a factor. In the case when both M1 and M2 are amenable, M is already known to have no Cartan subalgebra by [\cite=houdayer-ricard]. So we may assume that M1 is not amenable. Using [\cite=Dy92] [\cite=ueda-advances], we may further assume that M1 has no amenable direct summand and [formula]. By contradiction, assume that A  ⊂  M is a Cartan subalgebra.

We first use Connes-Takesaki's noncommutative flow of weights [\cite=connes73] [\cite=connestak] [\cite=Ta03] in order to work inside the semifinite von Neumann algebra [formula] which is the continuous core of M. We obtain a canonical decomposition of [formula] as the semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra [formula]. Moreover [formula] is a Cartan subalgebra.

Next, we use Popa's intertwining techniques in the setting of nontracial von Neumann algebras that were developed in [\cite=houdayer-vaes]. Since A is diffuse, we show that necessarily [formula] (see Proposition [\ref=intertwining-core]).

Finally, we extend Ioana's techniques from [\cite=Io12a] to semifinite AFP von Neumann algebras (see Theorems [\ref=dichotomy-intertwining] and [\ref=dichotomy-amenability]). The major difference though between our approach and Ioana's approach is that we cannot use the spectral gap techniques from [\cite=Io12a]. The main reason why Ioana's approach cannot work here is that [formula] is not full in general even though M is a full factor. Instead, we strengthen [\cite=Io12a] in the following way. We show that the presence of the Cartan subalgebra [formula] which satisfies [formula] forces both [formula] and [formula] to have an amenable direct summand. Therefore, both M1 and M2 have an amenable direct summand as well. Since we assumed that M1 had no amenable direct summand, this is a contradiction.

Preliminaries

Since we want the paper to be as self contained as possible, we recall in this section all the necessary background that will be needed for the proofs of the main results.

Intertwining techniques

All the von Neumann algebras that we consider in this paper are always assumed to be σ-finite. Let M be a von Neumann algebra. We say that a von Neumann subalgebra P  ⊂  1PM1P is with expectation if there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation EP:1PM1P  →  P. Whenever V  ⊂  M is a linear subspace, we denote by [formula] the unit ball of V with respect to the uniform norm [formula]. We will sometimes say that a von Neumann algebra (M,τ) is tracial if M is endowed with a faithful normal tracial state τ.

In [\cite=Po01] [\cite=popa-malleable1], Popa discovered the following powerful method to unitarily conjugate subalgebras of a finite von Neumann algebra. Let M be a finite von Neumann algebra and A  ⊂  1AM1A, B  ⊂  1BM1B von Neumann subalgebras. By [\cite=popa-malleable1] and [\cite=Po01], the following statements are equivalent:

There exist projections p∈A and q∈B, a nonzero partial isometry v∈pMq and a unital normal [formula]-homomorphism φ:pAp  →  qBq such that av  =  vφ(a) for all a∈A.

There exist n  ≥  1, a possibly nonunital normal [formula]-homomorphism [formula] and a nonzero partial isometry [formula] such that av  =  vπ(a) for all a∈A.

There is no net of unitaries (wk) in U(A) such that EB(x*wky)  →  0 [formula]-strongly for all x,y∈1AM1B.

If one of the previous equivalent conditions is satisfied, we say that A embeds into B inside M and write [formula].

We will need the following generalization of Popa's Intertwining Theorem which was proven in [\cite=houdayer-vaes]. A further generalization can also be found in [\cite=ueda12].

Observe that when 1A and 1B are finite projections in M then [formula] is finite, and [formula] in the sense of Definition [\ref=intertwining-general-definition] if and only if [formula] holds in the usual sense for finite von Neumann algebras.

In case of semifinite von Neumann algebras, we recall the following useful intertwining result (see [\cite=houdayer-ricard]). When [formula] is a semifinite von Neumann algebra endowed with a semifinite faithful normal trace, we will denote by [formula] the set of all nonzero finite trace projections of B. We will denote by [formula] the [formula]-norm associated with the trace [formula].

Let [formula] be a semifinite von Neumann algebra endowed with a semifinite faithful normal trace. Let B  ⊂  M be a von Neumann subalgebra such that [formula] is semifinite. Denote by EB:M  →  B the unique trace-preserving faithful normal conditional expectation.

Let [formula] and A  ⊂  pMp any von Neumann subalgebra. The following conditions are equivalent:

For every [formula], we have [formula].

There exists an increasing sequence of projections [formula] such that qn  →  1 strongly and [formula] for all [formula].

There exists a net of unitaries wk∈U(A) such that [formula] for all x,y∈pM.

(1)  ⇒  (2) is obvious.

(2)  ⇒  (3) Let [formula] be a finite subset and ε  >  0. We need to show that there exists w∈U(A) such that [formula] for all x,y∈F. Since the projection p has finite trace, there exists [formula] large enough such that

[formula]

Put q  =  qn. Since [formula], there exists a net wk∈U(A) such that [formula] for all a,b∈pMq. Appying this to a  =  pxq and b  =  pyq, if we take w  =  wk for k large enough, we get [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

(3)  ⇒  (1) Let [formula] and put [formula]. Let [formula] and denote by [formula] the [formula]-norm with respect to the normalized trace on eMe. For all x,y∈pMq, we have

[formula]

This means exactly that [formula] in the usual sense for tracial von Neumann algebras and so [formula].

Let Γ be any countable discrete group and S any nonempty collection of subgroups of Γ. Following [\cite=BO08], we say that a subset F  ⊂  Γ is small relative to S if there exist n  ≥  1, [formula] and [formula] such that [formula].

We will need the following generalization of [\cite=vaes-cohomology] and [\cite=houdayer-vaes].

Let [formula] be a semifinite von Neumann algebra endowed with a semifinite faithful normal trace. Let [formula] be a trace preserving action of a countable discrete group Γ on [formula] and denote by [formula] the corresponding semifinite crossed product von Neumann algebra. Let [formula] and A  ⊂  pMp any von Neumann subalgebra. Denote [formula].

For every subset F  ⊂  Γ which is small relative to S, denote by PF the orhogonal projection from [formula] onto the closed linear span of [formula].

The set [formula] is directed and attains its maximum in a projection z which belongs to Z(P).

There exists a net (wk) in U(Az) such that [formula] for every subset F  ⊂  Γ which is small relative to S.

For every ε  >  0, there exists a subset F  ⊂  Γ which is small relative to S such that [formula] for all a∈A(p  -  z).

(1) In order to show that the set J is directed and attains its maximum, it suffices to prove that whenever (ei)i∈I is a family of projections in [formula] and [formula], if e∉J, then there exists i∈I such that ei∉J. If e∉J, there exist Σ∈S and [formula] such that [formula]. Let n  ≥  1, a nonzero partial isometry [formula] and a normal [formula]-homomorphism [formula] such that av  =  vφ(a) for all a∈Ae. By definition we have ev  =  v. Choose i∈I such that eiv  ≠  0 and denote by [formula] the polar part of eiv. Since aw  =  wφ(a) for all a∈Ae, it follows that [formula]. Hence, ei∉J.

Denote by z the maximum of the set J. It is easy to see that uzu*∈J whenever u∈NpMp(A), hence uzu*  =  z. Therefore z∈Z(P).

(2) We have that [formula] for all Σ∈S and all [formula]. Let ε  >  0 and F  ⊂  Γ a subset which is small relative to S. We show that we can find w∈U(Az) such that [formula].

Let [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. Consider the semifinite von Neumann algebra [formula] together with the diagonal subalgebra [formula]. Observe that the canonical trace on [formula] is still semifinite on Q. Consider moreover the trace preserving [formula]-embedding [formula].

Since [formula] for all [formula] and all [formula], we get that [formula] for all [formula] by the first criterion in Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR]. Then by the second criterion in Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR], there exists a net wk∈U(Az) such that

[formula]

Recall that [formula] for all [formula]. Applying what we have just proved to x  =  u*gi and y  =  u*hi, we get that [formula] for all [formula]. Therefore [formula].

(3) By construction, for any projection e  ≤  p  -  z, there exist Σ∈S and [formula] such that [formula]. Let ε  >  0. Choose [formula] and [formula] pairwise orthogonal projections such that:

For every [formula], ei  ≤  p  -  z and [formula] satisfies [formula].

For every [formula], there exist ni  ≥  1, Σi∈S, a projection [formula], a nonzero partial isometry [formula] and a normal [formula]-homomorphism [formula] such that viv*i  =  ei and avi  =  viφi(a) for all a∈A.

Put [formula], [formula] and define [formula] by putting together the φi diagonally. Similarly, define the partial isometry [formula] such that vv*  =  e and av  =  vφ(a) for all a∈A.

Using Kaplansky density theorem, choose [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Define G  ⊂  Γ the finite subset such that v0 belongs to the linear span of [formula]. Put [formula].

Let [formula] and write a  =  a(p  -  z  -  e)  +  ae. Observe that [formula]. Since ae  =  vφ(a)v*, it follows that ae lies at a distance less than 2ε / 3 from v0φ(a)v*0. Observe that by construction PF(v0φ(a)v*0)  =  v0φ(a)v*0. Therefore, a lies at a distance less than ε from the range of PF.

Amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras

For i∈{1,2}, let B  ⊂  Mi be an inclusion of von Neumann algebras with expectation Ei:Mi  →  B. Recall that the amalgamated free product [formula] is the von Neumann algebra M generated by M1 and M2 where the faithful normal conditional expectation E:M  →  B satisfies the freeness condition:

[formula]

Here and in what follows, we denote by [formula] the kernel of the conditional expectation Ei:Mi  →  B. We refer to [\cite=voiculescu85] [\cite=voiculescu92] [\cite=ueda-pacific] for more details on the construction of amalgamated free products in the framework of von Neumann algebras.

Assume that [formula] is a semifinite faithful normal trace on B such that for all i∈{1,2}, the weight [formula] is a trace on Mi. Then the weight [formula] is a trace on M by [\cite=ueda-pacific]. In that case, we will say that the amalgamated free product [formula] is semifinite. Whenever we consider a semifinite faithful normal trace on a semifinite amalgamated free product [formula], we will always assume that [formula] and [formula] is semifinite.

The following proposition is a semifinite analogue of [\cite=IPP05]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=controlling-afp] is essentially contained in [\cite=CH08].

Using [\cite=Ta02], we denote by EM1:M  →  M1 the unique trace preserving faithful normal conditional expectation which satisfies

[formula]

whenever m  ≥  1, x1,x2m  +  1∈M1, [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  m  -  1. Observe that we moreover have [formula]. We denote by [formula] the kernel of the conditional expectation EM1:M  →  M1.

We have that [formula] for all [formula].

Observe that using Kaplansky's density theorem, it suffices to prove the Claim for [formula] and [formula] with m,n  ≥  1, x1,x2m  +  1,y1,y2n  +  1∈M1, [formula] and [formula] for all [formula] and all [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

Hence, [formula].

In particular, we get [formula] for all [formula]. Finally, applying [\cite=vaes-bourbaki-popa], we are done.

We will moreover need the following technical results.

Let [formula] be a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra with semifinite faithful normal trace [formula]. Assume the following:

For all i∈{1,2} and all nonzero projections z∈Z(B), Bz  ≠  zMiz.

For all [formula] and all [formula], we have [formula].

Then for all i∈{1,2}, all [formula] and all [formula], we have [formula].

By contradiction, assume that there exist i∈{1,2}, [formula] and [formula], a nonzero partial isometry v∈eMf and a unital normal [formula]-homomorphism φ:eMe  →  fMif such that xv  =  vφ(x) for all x∈eMe. We may assume without loss of generality that i  =  1. Moreover, as in [\cite=vaes-bimodules], we may assume that the support projection of EM1(v*v) in M1 equals f.

Let [formula] be arbitrary. By assumption, we have [formula]. Next, we claim that [formula]. Indeed, otherwise there would exist n  ≥  1, a nonzero partial isometry [formula] and a normal [formula]-homomorphism [formula] such that φ(x)w  =  wψ(φ(x)) for all x∈eMe. Hence, we get [formula] for all x∈eMe. We have [formula] since the support projection of EM1(v*v) is f and fw  =  w. By taking the polar part of vw, this would imply that [formula], a contradiction.

By Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR] and Theorem [\ref=controlling-afp], we get [formula], hence v*v∈fM1f. Thus, we may assume that v*v  =  f. We get fMf  =  v*Mv  ⊂  fM1f  ⊂  fMf, so fM1f  =  fMf. The proof of [\cite=houdayer-vaes] shows that there exists a nonzero projection z∈Z(B) such that zM2z  =  Bz, contradicting the assumptions.

Let [formula] be a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra with semifinite faithful normal trace [formula]. Let [formula] and A  ⊂  pMp any von Neumann subalgebra. Assume there exist i∈{1,2} and [formula] such that [formula].

Then either there exists [formula] such that [formula] or [formula].

We assume that for all [formula], we have [formula] and show that necessarily [formula].

Since [formula], there exist n  ≥  1, a nonzero partial isometry [formula] and a possibly nonunital normal [formula]-homomorphism [formula] such that av = vφ(a) for all a∈A. Since we also have [formula] for all [formula], a reasoning entirely analogous to the one of the proof of Proposition [\ref=intertwining-afp] allows us to further assume that [formula] for all [formula].

Let u∈NpMp(A). Then for all a∈A, we have

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=controlling-afp] and Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR], we get [formula] for all u∈NpMp(A), hence [formula]. Therefore, we have [formula].

Hilbert bimodules

Let M and N be any von Neumann algebras. Recall that an M-N- bimodule H is a Hilbert space endowed with two commuting normal [formula]-representations [formula] and [formula]. We then define [formula] by [formula] for all x∈M and all y∈N. We will simply write [formula] for all x∈M, all y∈N and all ξ∈H.

Let H and K be M-N-bimodules. Following [\cite=Co94], we say that K is weakly contained in H and write [formula] if [formula] for all [formula]. We simply denote by [formula] the standard form of N (see e.g. [\cite=Ta03]). Then the N-N-bimodule [formula] with left and right action given by xξy  =  xJy*Jξ is the trivial N-N-bimodule while the N-N-bimodule [formula] with left and right action given by [formula] is the coarse N-N-bimodule.

Recall that a von Neumann algebra N is amenable if as N-N-bimodules, we have [formula]. Equivalently, there exists a norm one projection [formula].

For any von Neumann algebras B,M,N, any M-B-bimodule H and any B-N-bimodule K, there is a well defined M-N-bimodule [formula] called the Connes's fusion tensor product of H and K over B. We refer to [\cite=Co94] and [\cite=AD93] for more details regarding this construction.

We will be using the following well known fact (see [\cite=AD93]). For any von Neumann algebras B,M,N such that B is amenable, any M-B-bimodule H and any B-N-bimodule K, we have, as M-N-bimodules,

[formula]

Relative amenability

Let M be any von Neumann algebra. Denote by [formula] the standard form of M. Let P  ⊂  1PM1P (resp. Q  ⊂  M) be a von Neumann subalgebra with expectation EP:1PM1P  →  P (resp. EQ:M  →  Q). The basic construction 〈M,Q〉 is the von Neumann algebra [formula]. Following [\cite=OP07], we say that P is amenable relative to Q inside M if there exists a norm one projection Φ:1P〈M,Q〉1P  →  P such that Φ|1PM1P  =  EP.

In the case when (M,τ) is a tracial von Neumann algebra and the conditional expectation EP:M  →  P (resp. EQ:M  →  Q) is τ-preserving, the basic construction that we denote by 〈M,eQ〉 coincides with the von Neumann algebra generated by M and the orthogonal projection [formula]. Observe that 〈M,eQ〉 comes with a semifinite faithful normal trace given by [formula] for all x,y∈M. Then [\cite=OP07] shows that P is amenable relative to Q inside M if and only if there exists a net of vectors [formula] such that [formula] for all x∈1PM1P and [formula] for all y∈P.

Noncommutative flow of weights

Let (M,φ) be a von Neumann algebra together with a faithful normal state. Denote by Mφ the centralizer of φ and by [formula] the continuous core of M, that is, the crossed product of M with the modular automorphism group [formula] associated with the faithful normal state φ. We have a canonical [formula]-embedding [formula] and a canonical group of unitaries [formula] in [formula] such that

[formula]

The unitaries [formula] generate a copy of [formula] inside [formula].

We denote by [formula] the dual weight on [formula] (see [\cite=Ta03]), which is a semifinite faithful normal weight on [formula] whose modular automorphism group [formula] satisfies

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the dual action on [formula], given by

[formula]

Denote by hφ the unique nonsingular positive selfadjoint operator affiliated with [formula] such that hisφ  =  λφ(s) for all [formula]. Then [formula] is a semifinite faithful normal trace on [formula] and the dual action θφ scales the trace [formula]: Note that [formula] is semifinite on [formula]. Moreover, the canonical faithful normal conditional expectation [formula] defined by [formula] preserves the trace [formula], that is,

Because of Connes's Radon-Nikodym cocycle theorem (see [\cite=Ta03]), the semifinite von Neumann algebra [formula], together with its trace [formula] and trace-scaling action [formula], "does not depend" on the choice of φ in the following precise sense. If ψ is another faithful normal state on M, there is a canonical surjective *  -isomorphism [formula] such that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Note however that Πψ,φ does not map the subalgebra [formula] onto the subalgebra [formula].

Altogether we can abstractly consider the continuous core [formula], where [formula] is a von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal semifinite trace [formula], θ is a trace-scaling action of [formula] on [formula] and [formula] contains a copy of M. Whenever φ is a faithful normal state on M, we get a canonical surjective [formula]-isomorphism [formula] such that

[formula]

A more functorial construction of the continuous core, known as the noncommutative flow of weights can be given, see [\cite=connes73] [\cite=connestak] [\cite=falcone].

By Takesaki's duality theorem [\cite=Ta03], we have that [formula]. In particular, by [\cite=AD93], M is amenable if and only if [formula] is amenable.

If P  ⊂  1PM1P is a von Neumann subalgebra with expectation, we have a canonical trace preserving inclusion [formula].

We will also frequently use the following well-known fact: if A  ⊂  M is a Cartan subalgebra then [formula] is still a Cartan subalgebra. For a proof of this fact, see e.g. [\cite=houdayer-ricard].

Let M be any von Neumann algebra with no amenable direct summand. Then the continuous core [formula] has no amenable direct summand either.

Assume that [formula] has an amenable direct summand. Let [formula] be a nonzero projection such that [formula] is amenable. Denote by [formula] the dual action which scales the trace [formula]. Put [formula]. Observe that [formula] and θt(e)  =  e for all [formula]. By [\cite=Ta03], we have [formula], hence e∈Z(M). We canonically have [formula].

Since amenability is stable under direct limits, we have that [formula] is amenable, hence [formula] is amenable. Applying again [\cite=Ta03], we have [formula]. We get that [formula] is amenable and so is Me. Therefore, M has an amenable direct summand.

We will frequently use the following:

Assume that we are in the setup of Notation [\ref=notation]. If [formula], then for all [formula] and all [formula], we have [formula].

Let vk∈U(A) be a net such that EB(x*vky)  →  0 [formula]-strongly for all x,y∈M. Recall that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. Observe that since p commutes with every element in [formula], p commutes with every element in [formula]. Then wk  =  ΠφB,φA(πφA(vk))p  =  πφB(vk)p is a net of unitaries in [formula].

Write [formula] for the algebraic crossed product, that is, the linear span of [formula]. Observe that [formula] is a dense unital [formula]-subalgebra of [formula]. We have [formula] [formula]-strongly for all [formula]. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Fix now [formula]. By Kaplansky density theorem, choose a net (xi)i∈I (resp. (yj)j∈J) in [formula] such that xi  →  px (resp. yj  →  py) [formula]-strongly. Let ε  >  0. Since [formula], we can choose (i,j)∈I  ×  J such that

[formula]

Therefore, by triangle inequality, we obtain

[formula]

Since ε  >  0 is arbitrary, we get [formula]. This finally proves that [formula].

We emphasize two well-known examples that will be extensively used in this paper.

Let [formula] be any nonsingular action on a standard measure space. Define the Maharam extension (see [\cite=maharam]) [formula] by

[formula]

where dm  =  dμ  ×   exp (t)dt. It is easy to see that the action [formula] preserves the infinite measure m and we moreover have that

[formula]

Let [formula] be any amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra. Fix a faithful normal state φ on B. We still denote by φ the faithful normal state [formula] on M. We realize the continuous core of M as [formula]. Likewise, if we denote by [formula] the corresponding state on Mi, we realize the continuous core of Mi as [formula]. We denote by [formula] (resp. [formula]) the canonical trace preserving faithful normal conditional expectation. Recall from [\cite=ueda-pacific] that [formula] for all [formula] and all i∈{1,2}, hence

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] is a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra.

Intertwining subalgebras inside semifinite AFP von Neumann algebras

Malleable deformation on semifinite AFP von Neumann algebras

First, we recall the construction of the malleable deformation on amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras discovered in [\cite=IPP05].

Let [formula] be any semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra with semifinite faithful normal trace [formula]. We will simply write [formula] when no confusion is possible. Put [formula] and observe that [formula] is still a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra. We still denote by [formula] the semifinite faithful normal trace on [formula]. Let [formula] be the canonical Haar unitaries generating [formula]. Observe that we can decompose [formula] with [formula].

Consider the unique Borel function [formula] such that f( exp (it))  =  t for all t∈( - π,π]. Define the selfadjoint operators h1  =  f(u1) and h2  =  f(u2) so that exp (iu1)  =  h1 and exp (iu2)  =  h2. For every [formula], put ut1  =   exp (ith1) and ut2  =   exp (ith2). We have

[formula]

Define the one-parameter group of trace preserving [formula]-automorphisms [formula] by

[formula]

Define moreover the trace preserving [formula]-automorphism [formula] by

[formula]

with β0(u1)  =  u*1 and β0(u2)  =  u*2. We have αtβ  =  βα-  t for all [formula]. Thus, (αt,β) is a malleable deformation in the sense of Popa [\cite=Po06b].

We will be using the following notation throughout this section.

Let m,n  ≥  1, [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] with [formula] for [formula]. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

The proof is the same as the proof of [\cite=Io12a]. We leave it to the reader.

Lemma [\ref=orthogonalranges] allows us, in particular, to put [formula] and [formula] since the KI's are pairwise orthogonal. We then have

[formula]

For all [formula], write [formula] with ξn∈Hn for all [formula]. A simple calculation shows that for all [formula],

[formula]

Observe that [formula] is decreasing on

[formula]

A semifinite analogue of Ioana-Peterson-Popa's intertwining theorem [\cite=IPP05]

The first result of this section is an analogue of the main technical result of [\cite=IPP05] (see [\cite=IPP05]) for semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras. A similar result also appeared in [\cite=CH08]. For the sake of completeness, we will give the proof.

By assumption, there exist c  >  0 and t∈(0,1) such that [formula] for all w∈U(A). Choose [formula] large enough such that 2- r  ≤  t. Then [formula] for all w∈U(A). So, we may assume that t  =  2- r. A standard functional analysis trick yields a nonzero partial isometry [formula] such that vx = αt(x)v for all x∈A. Observe that [formula] and [formula].

We prove the result by contradiction. Using Proposition [\ref=intertwining-afp-bis] and as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=intertwining-semifinite], we may choose a net of unitaries wk∈U(A) such that [formula] for all i∈{1,2} and all x,y∈pM. In particular, we get [formula] for all x,y∈pM. Regarding [formula], we get [formula] by Theorem [\ref=controlling-afp]. We use now Popa's malleability trick [\cite=popa-malleable1] and put [formula]. Since ww*  =  αt(vv*)  ≠  0, we get w  ≠  0 and wx  =  α2t(x)w for all x∈A. Iterating this construction, we find a nonzero partial isometry [formula] such that

[formula]

Moreover, using again Proposition [\ref=controlling-afp], we get [formula] and [formula].

Next, exactly as in the proof of [\cite=CH08], we obtain the following.

We have [formula] for all [formula].

Regard [formula]. By Kaplansky density theorem, it suffices to prove the Claim for x  =  pa and y  =  pb with a,b in B or reduced words in [formula] with letters alternating from [formula] and [formula]. Write a  =  ca' with c  =  a if a∈B; c  =  1 if a begins with a letter from [formula]; c equals the first letter of a otherwise. Likewise, write b  =  db'. Then we have x*wky  =  a*wkb  =  a'*  c*wkd  b' and note that c*wkd∈M. Observe that a' (resp. b') equals 1 or is a reduced word beginning with a letter from [formula].

Denote by P the orthogonal projection from [formula] onto [formula]. Observe that since [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence, [formula]. Moreover, a simple calculation shows that

[formula]

Therefore, [formula]. This finishes the proof of the Claim.

Finally, combining Equation () together with the Claim, we get

[formula]

This contradicts the fact that v  ≠  0 and finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=convergence-deformation].

A semifinite analogue of Ioana's intertwining theorem [\cite=Io12a]

Let [formula] be a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra with semifinite faithful normal trace [formula]. Put [formula] and observe that [formula] is still a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra. We still denote by [formula] the semifinite faithful normal trace on [formula]. Let [formula]. Observe that N can be identified with an infinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra, that [formula] is semifinite and that, under this identification, the action [formula] is given by the free Bernoulli shift which preserves the canonical trace [formula]. We moreover have [formula].

We will denote by [formula] the unique trace preserving faithful normal conditional expectation as well as the orthogonal projection [formula].

We prove next the analogue of [\cite=Io12a] for semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras.

The main technical lemma that will be used to prove Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-intertwining] is a straightforward generalization of [\cite=Io12a]. We include a proof for the sake of completeness.

Let t∈(0,1) and [formula]. For all n  ≥  0, define

[formula]

Then lim ncn  =  0.

First, observe that for all [formula] and all [formula], we have

[formula]

Thus for all I∈Sn, we have [formula] and since αt(HI)  ⊂  KI, we get that [formula] for all x∈HI. So defining

[formula]

we see that cn  =   max I∈SncI since the subspaces KI's are pairwise orthogonal.

Let us fix [formula] and calculate cI. Denote by a and b the canonical generators of [formula] so that u1  =  ua, u2  =  ub and put G1  =  〈a〉 and G2  =  〈b〉. For [formula], define a map

[formula]

for all [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=orthogonalranges], these maps [formula] extend to isometries [formula] with pairwise orthogonal ranges when [formula] are pairwise distinct. Indeed, we have [formula] unless [formula]. Since moreover [formula], this further implies that gj  =  gj' and hj  =  hj' for all [formula].

Denote the Fourier coefficients of ut1 and ut2 respectively by β1(g1) = τ(ut1u*g1) for g1∈G1 and β2(g2) = τ(ut2u*g2) for g2∈G2. We have an explicit formula for these coefficients given by

[formula]

It follows in particular that [formula] for all i∈{1,2} and all gi∈Gi. Since ut1 and ut2 are unitaries, we moreover have

[formula]

If [formula] with [formula] satisfying [formula], we have

[formula]

where the sum converges in [formula]. Thus, for all x∈HI, we get

[formula]

Now, using the calculation (), and the fact that the isometries [formula] have mutually orthogonal ranges, we get that for all x∈HI,

[formula]

Thus we get an explicit formula for cI given by

[formula]

For i∈{1,2}, define [formula] by μi(g)  =  βi(g)2 if g∈Gi and μi(g)  =  0 otherwise. Likewise, define [formula] by [formula] for all [formula]. Put [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

So if we put [formula], we have that

[formula]

Then [\cite=Io12a] implies that [formula] for all [formula] and so lim ncn  =  0.

Assume by contradiction that the conclusion of the theorem does not hold. Then Theorem [\ref=convergence-deformation] implies that for t∈(0,1) there exists a net wk∈U(A) such that

[formula]

We will show that for all [formula], we have [formula], which will contradict the assumption of Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-intertwining]. By a linearity/density argument, it is sufficient to show that for all [formula],

[formula]

For all k, we have [formula] so that we can write [formula], with wk,n∈Hn. Recall that [formula]. Thus the fact that [formula] implies that for all n  ≥  0, [formula].

Fix [formula] and ε  >  0. Note that for n  ≥  1, EN(ugαt(wk,n)uh)∈Kn, so that all these terms are pairwise orthogonal. They are also all orthogonal to EN(ugαt(wk,0)uh), which belongs to K0. Thus

[formula]

where cn is defined in Lemma [\ref=cn]. Observe that cn  ≤  1 for all [formula].

Lemma [\ref=cn] implies that there exists n0  ≥  0 such that for all n  >  n0, c2n  <  ε / 2. Then we can find k0 such that for all k  ≥  k0, and all n  ≤  n0, [formula]. So we get that for all k  ≥  k0,

[formula]

This shows () and finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-intertwining].

Relative amenability inside semifinite AFP von Neumann algebras

Let [formula] be a semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebra with semifinite faithful normal trace [formula]. Recall that [formula], [formula] and observe that [formula]. We denote by [formula] the malleable deformation from Section [\ref=section-malleable].

The main result of this section is the following strengthening of Ioana's result [\cite=Io12a] in the framework of semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras over an amenable subalgebra.

Let [formula] be the semifinite faithful normal trace on [formula]. Consider the basic construction [formula] associated with the inclusion of tracial von Neumann algebras [formula].

We denote by [formula] the faithful normal tracial state on [formula] and by [formula] the [formula]-norm on [formula] associated with τ. We then simply denote by [formula] the canonical semifinite faithful normal trace on [formula] given by [formula] for all [formula]. Observe that [formula]. Following [\cite=Io12a], we define the qM1q-qM1q-bimodule

[formula]

Denote by [formula].

As qM1q-qM1q-bimodules, we have that [formula].

The proof goes along the same lines as [\cite=Io12a]. First observe that since [formula], we have

[formula]

So it suffices to prove that for all [formula] such that h  ≠  g- 1, as qM1q-qM1q-bimodules, we have

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the qM1q-qM1q-bimodule [formula] with left and right action given by x  ·  ξ  ·  y  =  xξugyu*g for all x,y∈qM1q and all [formula]. Likewise, define the M1-M1-bimodule [formula]. As qM1q-qM1q-bimodules, we have

[formula]

Put [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Using [\cite=ueda-pacific], there are B-B-bimodules L and Lg for [formula], such that as M1-M1-bimodules, we have

[formula]

Since B is amenable, we have that [formula] as B-B-bimodules. Using [\cite=AD93], we obtain that, as qM1q-qM1q-bimodules,

[formula]

Since [formula] is isomorphic to a qM1q-qM1q-subbimodule of [formula], we infer that, as qM1q-qM1q-bimodules,

[formula]

Similarly, for all [formula] we get that, as qM1q-qM1q-bimodules,

Since αt(qMq) is amenable relative to qNq inside [formula], we find a net of vectors [formula] for n∈I, such that

[formula] for all [formula], and

[formula] for all x∈αt(qMq).

Observe that using the proof of [\cite=OP07] we may assume that ξn  ≥  0 so that [formula] for all [formula] and all n∈I. Since [formula], we may further assume that [formula] for all n∈I.

By contradiction, assume that for some i∈{1,2}, qMiq has no amenable direct summand. Without loss of generality, we may assume that i  =  1. Denote by [formula] the orthogonal projection. Observe that PH1 is the orthogonal projection corresponding to the unique trace preserving faithful normal conditional expectation [formula] onto the von Neumann subalgebra [formula]. We claim that [formula]. If this is not the case, let ζn  =  (1  -  PH1)(ut *1ξnut1)∈H and observe that [formula]. Arguing as in the proof of [\cite=Io12a], we may further assume that [formula].

Then ζn∈H is a net of vectors which satisfies the following conditions:

[formula];

[formula] for all x∈qM1q;

[formula] for all y∈qM1q.

Since as qM1q-qM1q-bimodules, we have that [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:weak-containment], it follows that qM1q has an amenable direct summand by Connes's result [\cite=connes76]. This contradicts our assumption and we have shown that [formula].

Put L1  =  ut1H1ut *1 and denote by [formula] the orthogonal projection. Put ηn  =  PL1(ξn) and observe that ηn∈L1 and ηn  ≥  0. We moreover have [formula]. So ηn∈L1 is a net of vectors which satisfy

[formula] for all [formula], and

[formula] for all x∈αt(qMq).

We have [formula] with [formula]. Since ηn  =  η*n for all n∈I, we may assume that xn,g  =  x*n,g for all n∈I and all [formula]. Next, we claim that we may further assume that xn,g∈qM1q with xn,g  =  x*n,g for all n∈I and all [formula].

To do so, define the set J of triples j  =  (X,Y,ε) where [formula], [formula] are finite subsets and ε  >  0. We make J a directed set by putting (X,Y,ε)  ≤  (X',Y',ε') if and only if X  ⊂  X', Y  ⊂  Y' and ε'  ≤  ε. Let j  =  (X,Y,ε)∈J. There exists n∈I such that [formula] and [formula] for all x∈X and all y∈Y. Let [formula] such that [formula]. For each [formula], choose yj,g∈qM1q such that yj,g  =  y*j,g and [formula]. Put [formula] and observe that ηj'  =  ηj'* and [formula]. We get [formula] and [formula] for all x∈X and all y∈Y. Then the net (ηj')j∈J clearly satisfies Conditions [formula] and [formula] above. This finishes the proof of the claim.

Fix any [formula] satisfying [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Expanding αt(y) and ηn, we obtain

[formula]

Recall from Section [\ref=section-malleable] the definition of the Hilbert spaces Kk for [formula] and denote by bn,g  =  EqBq(xn,g). Since we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

we get

[formula]

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-intertwining], for i∈{1,2}, put G1  =  〈a〉 and G2  =  〈b〉 so that u1  =  ua and u2  =  ub. Denote by (βi(g))g∈Gi the Fourier coefficients of uti. For [formula], define the isometry [formula] by Wg,h(x)  =  ugxu*h for [formula] such that [formula]. Thanks to Lemma [\ref=orthogonalranges], the isometries Wg,h have pairwise orthogonal ranges when (g,h) are pairwise distinct. For all [formula] and all [formula], using calculation (), we obtain

[formula]

Using the facts that [formula] and that the isometries Wg',h' have pairwise orthogonal ranges when (g',h') are pairwise distinct, we get

[formula]

For i∈{1,2}, define [formula] by μi(g)  =  βi(g)2 if g∈Gi and μi(g)  =  0 otherwise. Likewise, define [formula] by [formula] for all [formula]. Put [formula]. Since [formula] and xn,g∈qM1q, we obtain that

[formula]

Summing over all [formula] and using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Since we moreover have [formula], we get

[formula]

Likewise we have [formula].

Denote by [formula] the Markov operator defined by [formula]. Since the support of μ generates [formula] and μ(e)  >  0 (see the proof of [\cite=Io12a]), Kesten's criterion for amenability [\cite=kesten] yields [formula]. This gives

[formula]

Since ηn  =  η*n, we obtain

[formula]

hence [formula]. This however contradicts the fact that

[formula]

and hence our assumption that qM1q had no amenable direct summand. Thus for all i∈{1,2}, qMiq has an amenable direct summand and so does Mi. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-amenability].

A combination of the proof of the above Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-amenability] and the one of [\cite=Io12a] shows that "or" can be replaced with "and" in Ioana's result [\cite=Io12a].

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=thmA] and [\ref=thmB]

A general intermediate result

Theorems [\ref=thmA] and [\ref=thmB] will be derived from the following very general result regarding Cartan subalgebras inside semifinite amalgamated free product von Neumann algebras.

Put [formula] and regard [formula] as the tracial crossed product von Neumann algebra [formula] with [formula]. We denote by (αt) the malleable deformation from Section [\ref=section-malleable]. Applying Popa-Vaes's dichotomy result [\cite=PV11] to the inclusion [formula] for t∈(0,1), we get that at least one of the following holds true:

Either [formula].

Or αt(pMp) is amenable relative to pNp inside [formula].

Since M1 has no amenable direct summand, case (2) cannot hold by Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-amenability]. It remains to show that case (1) leads to the conclusion of the theorem.

In case (1), using Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR] and Theorem [\ref=dichotomy-intertwining], we get that either there exists [formula] such that [formula] or there exist i∈{1,2} and [formula] such that [formula]. Since the latter case is impossible by Proposition [\ref=intertwining-afp], we get [formula] for some [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmA]

We first need to prove the following well-known result.

Let M be any von Neumann algebra such that [formula] and φ any faithful normal state on M. Realize the continuous core [formula]. Then for every nonzero projection [formula], we have [formula].

There are two cases to consider.

Case (1): assume that [formula]. Choose r∈Mφ a projection such that r  ≠  0,1. Observe that x  =  φ(1  -  r)  r  -  φ(r)  (1  -  r)∈Mφ is invertible and φ(x)  =  0. Then for every nonzero projection [formula], we have xp  ≠  0 and [formula]. This proves that [formula].

Case (2): assume that [formula]. Since Z(M)  ⊂  Z(Mφ), it follows that M is a factor. If M is of type III, it follows from Connes's classification of type III factors [\cite=connes73] that M is necessarily of type III1. In that case, [formula] is a type II ∞  factor and thus [formula] for every nonzero projection [formula]. If M is a semifinite factor with semifinite faithful normal trace [formula], there exists [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Let q∈M be a nonzero spectral projection of b. Since

[formula]

for all x∈M, we get q∈Mφ and so q  =  1. This shows that b  =  1 and [formula] is a finite trace on M. Hence [formula], which is a contradiction.

By [\cite=ueda-advances], we know that there exists a nonzero projection z∈Z(M) such that Mz is a full factor and M(1  -  z) is a purely atomic von Neumann algebra. In particular, M is not amenable.

In the case when both M1 and M2 are amenable, [\cite=houdayer-ricard] implies that M has no Cartan subalgebra. It remains to consider the case when M1 or M2 is not amenable. Without loss of generality, we may assume that M1 is not amenable.

By contradiction, assume that M has a Cartan subalgebra. Hence, Mz also has a Cartan subalgebra. Let p∈Z(M1) be the largest nonzero projection such that M1p has no amenable direct summand. Since M(1  -  z) is purely atomic, we necessarily have p  ≤  z.

By [\cite=ueda-advances], we have

[formula]

with [formula]. Observe that [formula]. Indeed let q∈M2 be a projection such that q  ≠  0,1. Then [formula]. Since Mz is a factor and p  ≤  z, it follows that pMp has a Cartan subalgebra by [\cite=popa-malleable1].

From the previous discussion, it follows that we may assume that M1 has no amenable direct summand, [formula] and M has a Cartan subalgebra A  ⊂  M. Using Notation [\ref=notation], denote by [formula] the Cartan subalgebra in the continuous core [formula]. Let [formula]. Since [formula] is maximal abelian and [formula] is semifinite, [\cite=houdayer-vaes] shows that there exists a nonzero finite trace projection [formula] and a partial isometry [formula] such that p  =  v*v and q  =  vv*. Observe that [formula] is still a Cartan subalgebra by [\cite=popa-malleable1].

By Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR], Proposition [\ref=amenable-core], Theorem [\ref=general-semifinite] and Lemma [\ref=nontrivial-free-product], there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Then Proposition [\ref=intertwining-core] implies that [formula]. This contradicts the fact that A is diffuse and finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmA].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmB]

Let A  ⊂  M be a Cartan subalgebra. Since A,B  ⊂  M are both tracial von Neumann subalgebras of M with expectation, we use Notation [\ref=notation]. Let [formula]. By [\cite=houdayer-vaes], there exists [formula] and a partial isometry [formula] such that p  =  v*v and q  =  vv*. Observe that [formula] is still a Cartan subalgebra by [\cite=popa-malleable1].

Using the assumptions, by Lemma [\ref=intertwining-general-HR], Proposition [\ref=amenable-core], [\cite=houdayer-vaes] and Theorem [\ref=general-semifinite], there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Then Proposition [\ref=intertwining-core] implies that [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmC]

Let R be any countable nonsingular equivalence relation on a standard measure space (X,μ). Following [\cite=feldman-moore], denote by m the measure on R given by

[formula]

for all measurable subsets W  ⊂  R. We denote by

[formula]

(u(ψ)ξ)(x,y) = ( (x)) ξ(ψ(x),y).

[formula]

Φ(u(ψ) F u(ψ)) = u(ψ) Φ(F) u(ψ), ψ ∈.

[formula]

(M) = ((R)),   (M) = ((R)),   (M) = ((R))     (M) = (M) (M).

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmD]

We start by proving Theorem [\ref=thmD] in the infinite measure preserving case. More precisely, we deduce the following result from its finite measure preserving counterpart proven in [\cite=Io12a].

For every subset F  ⊂  Γ, denote by PF the orthogonal projection from [formula] onto the closed linear span of [formula]. Since [formula], Proposition [\ref=intertwining-semifinite] (see also [\cite=houdayer-vaes]) provides a central projection z∈Z(pMp) and a net of unitaries wk∈U(Az) such that:

[formula] for all finite subset F  ⊂  Γ.

For every ε  >  0, there exists a finite subset F  ⊂  Γ such that [formula] for all [formula].

We prove by contradiction that z  =  0. So, assume that z  ≠  0. Recall that [formula]. Hence the subgroup [formula] is finite and normal in Γ. Define the quotient homomorphism ρ:Γ  →  Γ  /  Σ0 and put Λ  =  Γ  /  Σ0, Λi  =  Γi  /  Σ0 for i∈{1,2}, Υ  =  Σ  /  Σ0 so that [formula]. We get that [formula], hence [formula] is a II1 factor which does not have property Gamma by [\cite=Io12a].

Define the unitary [formula] by

[formula]

Next, define the dual coaction [formula] by [formula] for all x∈M. Observe that Δρ is a trace preserving [formula]-embedding which satisfies [formula] for all b∈B and all g∈Γ.

For every subset F  ⊂  Γ, denote by Qρ(F) the orthogonal projection from [formula] onto the closed linear span of {vρ(g):g∈F}. Observe that [formula] for all x∈M. Since Δρ is [formula]-preserving and since Σ0 is finite, for any finite subset F  ⊂  Γ, we have

[formula]

Since Υ  <  Λ is a finite subgroup, this implies that [formula] for all [formula].

Put [formula] and consider the malleable deformation (αt) on [formula] from Section [\ref=section-malleable]. Define N  <  Λ the normal subgroup generated by [formula] so that [formula] with [formula]. Applying Popa-Vaes's dichotomy result [\cite=PV11] to each of the inclusions

[formula]

we obtain that at least one of the following holds true:

Either there exists t∈(0,1) such that [formula].

Or for all t∈(0,1), [formula] is amenable relative to [formula] inside [formula].

We will prove below that each case leads to a contradiction.

In case (1), by [\cite=Io12a] and since [formula] and [formula], there exists i∈{1,2} such that [formula]. In order to get a contradiction, we will need the following.

Let [formula], Q  ⊂  eMe any von Neumann subalgebra and S any nonempty collection of subgroups of Γ. If [formula] for all H∈S and all [formula], then [formula] for all H∈S and all [formula].

Since [formula] for all H∈S and all [formula], Proposition [\ref=intertwining-semifinite] implies that there exists a net vk∈U(Q) such that [formula] for all subsets F  ⊂  Γ which are small relative to S. Observe that since Σ0 is finite, Σ0F is small relative to S for all subsets F  ⊂  Γ which are small relative to S. Moreover, [formula] for all x∈Q and all subsets F  ⊂  Γ which are small relative to S. Since Δρ is [formula]-preserving, for all subsets F  ⊂  Γ which are small relative to S, we have

[formula]

Denote by ρ(S) the nonempty collection of subgroups ρ(H)  ⊂  Λ with H∈S. Let G  ⊂  Λ be any subset which is small relative to ρ(S). Then there exist n  ≥  1, [formula] and [formula] such that [formula]. Choose gi,hi∈Γ such that ρ(gi)  =  si and ρ(hi)  =  ti and denote [formula]. Then G  ⊂  ρ(F). Therefore, () implies that [formula] for all subsets G  ⊂  Λ which are small relative to ρ(S). Thus, Proposition [\ref=intertwining-semifinite] implies that [formula] for all H∈S and all [formula].

We apply the Claim to Q  =  pMpz and S  =  {Γ1,Γ2}. In order to do that, we need to check that [formula] for all i∈{1,2} and all [formula]. Since [formula] is a type I von Neumann algebra and [formula] is a type II von Neumann algebra, Proposition [\ref=intertwining-afp] yields the result. Therefore, by the Claim, we get that [formula] for all i∈{1,2}. This is a contradiction.

In case (2), since [formula] does not have property Gamma, [\cite=Io12a] shows that either there exists i∈{1,2} such that [formula] or [formula] is amenable. Both of these cases are easily seen to lead to a contradiction. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=gms-semifinite].

Let now [formula] be any nonsingular free ergodic action on a standard measure space such that for all i∈{1,2}, the restricted action [formula] is recurrent. Let [formula] and put [formula]. Assume that A  ⊂  M is another Cartan subalgebra.

Since A,B  ⊂  M are both tracial von Neumann subalgebras of M with expectation, we use Notation [\ref=notation]. Define [formula] and consider the Maharam extension [formula] of the action [formula] so that we canonically have [formula]. Observe that for all i∈{1,2}, the action [formula] is still recurrent so that [formula] is a type II von Neumann algebra.

Let [formula]. By [\cite=houdayer-vaes], there exist [formula] and a partial isometry [formula] such that p  =  v*v and q  =  vv*. Observe that [formula] is still a Cartan subalgebra by [\cite=popa-malleable1].

By Theorem [\ref=gms-semifinite], we get [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=intertwining-core], this implies that [formula]. Since M is a factor, by [\cite=houdayer-vaes], we get that there exists a unitary u∈U(M) such that uAu*  =  B. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmD].

AFP von Neumann algebras with many nonconjugate Cartan subalgebras

Connes and Jones exhibited in [\cite=CJ81] the first examples of II1 factors M with at least two Cartan subalgebras which are not conjugate by an automorphism of M. More concrete examples were found by Ozawa and Popa in [\cite=OP08].

Recently, Speelman and Vaes exhibited in [\cite=SV11] the first examples of group measure space II1 factors [formula] with uncountably many non stably conjugate Cartan subalgebras. Recall from [\cite=SV11] that two Cartan subalgebras A and B of a II1 factor N are stably conjugate if there exists nonzero projections p∈A and q∈B and a surjective [formula]-isomorphism α:pNp  →  qNq such that α(Ap)  =  Bq. Put [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Observe that A and B are Cartan subalgebras in the type II ∞  factor N. Moreover, we have that A and B are stably conjugate in N if and only if A and B are conjugate in N.

Let [formula] be a probability measure preserving free ergodic action as in the statement of [\cite=SV11] so that the corresponding group measure space II1 factor [formula] has uncountably many non stably conjugate Cartan subalgebras.

Put [formula] and consider the induced action [formula] with [formula]. Observe that [formula] is an infinite measure preserving free ergodic action. Write [formula] for the corresponding group measure space type II ∞  factor. Since [formula], we canonically have [formula] with [formula], [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand, we also have

[formula]

Therefore we obtain the following result.

This result shows that the condition in Theorem [\ref=thmD] imposing recurrence of the action [formula] for all i∈{1,2}, is indeed necessary.
