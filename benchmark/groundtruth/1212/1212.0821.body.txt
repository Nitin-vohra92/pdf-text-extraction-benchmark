Riesz means and Greedy Sums.

Motivation.

The concept of greedy sum [formula] of a numerical array {as}s∈S was introduced in [\cite=Shch].

The direct product {asbt}s,t∈S  ×  T of two greedy summable numeric arrays {as}s∈S {bt}t∈T is not greedy summable in general. To sum up such products we adopt the general method of Riesz means.

Arithmetic Riesz means.

Let {λn} be an increasing to infinity sequence of positive numbers and κ be a positive number. The series [formula] is called summable by Riesz method with parameters ({λn},κ to the sum A if

[formula]

If we consider a sequence of complex numbers an, such that [formula], then we can substitute in this definition [formula] and [formula]. Riesz means with such parameters being applied to Dirichlet series associated with a numerical array {as}s∈S (see [\cite=Shch]) led us to the following definition. � numeric array {as}s∈S is called greedy κ-summable for some positive κ, if there exists the following limit

[formula]

which we name as greedy κ-sum of the array. For κ = 0 the concept of greedy κ-sum converts into the original concept of greedy sum.

If an array {as}s∈S has greedy κ-sum equal to A for some κ then it has the greedy κ'-sum for any κ' < κ.

The above theorem follows from the theorem 16 of [\cite=H-R].

If an array {as}s∈S has greedy κ1-sum equal to A and another array {bt}t∈T has greedy κ2-sum equal to B, then their product {asbt}s,t∈S  ×  T has greedy (κ1  +  κ2 + 1)-sum equal to AB.

The last theorem follows from the theorem 56 of [\cite=H-R].
