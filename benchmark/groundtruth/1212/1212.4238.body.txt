Trivial symmetries in a 3D topological torsion model of gravity

Introduction

Gauge symmetries and their systematic construction, while being of great significance, is fraught with subtleties. They must be off-shell, i.e. the action should remain invariant under them without use of any equations of motion and there are systematic algorithms for construction of such off-shell symmetries [\cite=Henneaux:1990au] [\cite=Banerjee:1999yc] [\cite=Banerjee:1999hu]. In models of gravity obtained by gauging Poincare symmetries, it is however seen that such systematic approaches yield the Poincare symmetries only on-shell. So, at the off-shell level, it appears that there are two independent set of symmetries. This is unsettling. We would then be required to find additional independent first-class constraints to support these symmetries. However, physically the only independent symmetries present are the space-time translations and Lorentz boosts, i.e. the Poincare symmetries.

We set up the model in the Poincare gauge theory (PGT) formalism [\cite=Utiyama:1956sy] [\cite=Kibble:1961ba] [\cite=Sciama:1962]. The global Poincare symmetries on a set of global coordinates xμ are localised at every spacetime point by introducing local frames having coordinates xi. Both sets are 3-dimensional for our model, though the construction can be carried out in any dimensions. To change physical variables from one set of coordinates to another, triad fields are introduced, which are defined through

[formula]

Here 'g' and 'η' are the metrics of the global and local sets of coordinates, respectively and 'η' is the standard Minkowskian metric with signature ( + , - , - ). Now, to keep the invariance of the theory, a gauge connection field 'ωi μ' is introduced through a newly defined gauge covariant derivative. For an arbitrary vector Ai, the derivative is written as

[formula]

The corresponding field strengths give rise to gravitational fields

[formula]

where Ri μν  =  ∂μωi ν  -  ∂μωi ν  +  εi jk  ωj μωk ν defines the Riemann. Similarly, the commutator of [formula] derivatives give rise to the torsion [formula] It must be emphasised that this is a setting in the Riemann-Cartan spacetime rather than the Riemann spacetime of usual general relativity. In general it contains torsion, which goes to zero only after imposition of the connection variable's equation of motion, giving back the torsion free Riemannian manifold of general relativity. The Poincare symmetries of the basic fields are [\cite=Banerjee:2009vf]

[formula]

where θi parametrizes local Lorentz rotations and ξρ local coordinate translations. They together constitute the 3 + 3 = 6 independent Poincare symmetries in 3D. These symmetries are independent of the particular action being considered, so long as they are constructed in a proper tensorial manner.

Now, symmetries of an action can be constructed via a Hamiltonian analysis through completely off-shell procedures, as stated before. After this is carried out, we find the symmetries which keeps the action invariant, as expected. However they cannot be identified with the Poincare symmetries [\eqref=PGT_deltas], even after an appropriate field-dependent redefinition of the symmetry parameters. The clue of identification, as we show, lies in 'trivial' gauge symmetries [\cite=Henneaux:1992ig] [\cite=Henneaux:2009zb]. They are symmetries of the form

[formula]

which keep any action off-shell invariant due to antisymmetry in the coefficients Λij. Thus

[formula]

without depending on the form of the Euler derivatives [formula] and without requiring the imposition of the equations of motion [formula]

In what follows, we take up the Mielke-Baekler model, summarise its Hamiltonian constraints, outline construction of an off-shell gauge generator and generate gauge symmetries. These are then compared with the Poincare symmetries to see how the two may actually be equivalent.

Hamiltonain analysis and construction of a gauge generator

The Mielke-Baekler 3D topological gravity model with torsion [\cite=Baekler:1992ab] along with a cosmological term is described by

[formula]

whose equations of motion are found by setting the Euler derivatives to zero

[formula]

The constraints in the above model are [\cite=Blagojevic:2004hj] listed in Table [\ref=Tab:Constraints_MB] with the definitions

[formula]

The gauge generator G which generates gauge symmetries is, by the Dirac principle, a linear combination of all first class constraints

[formula]

the sum in A running over the complete first-class sector. The symmetries of the basic variables are then obtained through δq  =  {q,G}*  =  εA{q,ψA}* where {  ,  }* indicates Dirac brackets obtained through elimination of the second class sector χ [\cite=Banerjee:2009vf].

Now, we know that all the gauge parameters εA are not independent, as the number of independent gauge parameters must equal the number of independent primary first-class constraints. In the off-shell method that we adopt [\cite=Henneaux:1990au] [\cite=Banerjee:1999yc] [\cite=Banerjee:1999hu], the restriction on εA is obtained from the commutativity of gauge variations and time evolution [formula] Explicit calculations [\cite=Banerjee:2009vf] yield the generator

[formula]

where τi and σi are six independent gauge parameters. We are now ready to study the gauge symmetries of the model utilising this generator.

Hamiltonian and Poincare gauge: role of trivial symmetries

The generator [\eqref=Gen_MB] yields the following symmetries of the basic fields

[formula]

A first comparison of the two sets of symmetries [\eqref=PGT_deltas] and [\eqref=symm_MB] reveals that the Hamiltonian symmetries are explicitly dependant on the coupling parameters of the various terms in the action [\eqref=action_TMG], in contrast to the PGT symmetries. Also, we note that the gauge parameters of the two symmetries are different. So we need to map the gauge parameters of [\eqref=symm_MB] into the PGT gauge parameters. This is achieved through the field dependent map [\cite=Blagojevic:2004hj]

[formula]

Using this map, the Hamiltonian symmetries can be written in the form

[formula]

It may seem that the two symmetries are thus equivalent only on-shell. To show that this is not the case, we write out their form explicitly

[formula]

To cast the balance terms of [formula] into the form [\eqref=trivial_gauge_gen], we first write down the appropriate Λ matrix:

[formula]

The anti-symmetry of the above structure can now be easily demonstrated. As an example,

[formula]

So, we see that indeed 'δ' is of the required form [\eqref=trivial_gauge_gen] for trivial gauge symmetries. Thus the invariance of the action can now be achieved under these 'balance' symmetries [formula] without the use of any equations of motion. Hence we see, that from a canonical point of view,

[formula]

as their difference is just an un-physical 'trivial' symmetry.
