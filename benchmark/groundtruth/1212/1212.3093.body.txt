Notation

In this note we are only concerned with simple undirected graphs G  =  (V,E) where V is a set and E  ⊆  P2(V) where

[formula]

We also require that [formula] to avoid notational ambiguities. We denote the vertex set of a graph G by V(G) and the edge set by E(G). Moreover, for any cardinal α we denote the complete graph on α points by Kα.

For any graph G, disjoint subsets S,T  ⊆  V(G) are said to be connected to each other if there are s∈S,t∈T with {s,t}∈E(G). Note that Kα is a minor of a graph G if and only if there is a collection {Sβ:β∈α} of nonempty, connected and pairwise disjoint subsets of V(G) such that for all β,γ∈α with β  ≠  γ the sets Sβ and Sγ are connected to each other. We will need the following observation later on:

For any graph G, finite or infinite, the following are equivalent:

G is connected;

if S,T  ⊆  V(G) are nonempty and disjoint such that [formula] then S,T are connected to each other.

The construction

In [\cite=Ha], Hadwiger formulated his well-known and deep conjecture, linking the chromatic number χ(G) of a graph G with clique minors. His conjecture can be formulated that Kχ(G) is a minor of G for every graph G. In the following we present a connected graph H with chromatic number ω such that Kω is not a minor of H. Let [formula] be the set of positive integers. For any [formula] we let

[formula]

and set [formula] As for the edge set of H, we define

[formula]

χ(H)  =  ω.

Since we have [formula] we get χ(H)  ≤  ω. Moreover, each Cn is a complete subgraph of H, so H cannot be colored with finitely many colors.

For the remainder of this note, we assume that {Sn:n∈ω} is a collection of nonempty, connected, pairwise disjoint subsets of H such that for m  ≠  n the sets Sn,Sm are connected to each other. Our goal is to show that such a collection cannot exist.

First, we need a simple observation on what a connected subset of H looks like. If S  ⊆  V(H) we define [formula].

Suppose S  ⊆  V(H) is connected and m < n∈I(S). Then for all [formula] with m  ≤  x  ≤  n we have (1,x)∈S.

If (1,m)∉S then [formula] and [formula] are disjoint, nonempty and not connected to each other. By Fact [\ref=connectedness], S is not connected, contradicting our assumption. A similar argument shows that (1,n)∈S. Suppose there is x with m < x < n and (1,x)∉S. Then set T  =  {(i,j)∈S:j  <  x}. Again, T and [formula] are nonempty and not connected to each other, so S is not connected, contradicting our assumption.

If {Sn:n∈ω} is a collection of subsets of V(H) as described above, then for every [formula] the set of neighbors of Sk, which is denoted by N(Sk), must be infinite. As the next lemma shows, this implies that I(Sk) must be infinite for all [formula].

If S  ⊆  V(H) is such that I(S) is finite, then N(S) is finite.

Let m =  max (IS). Then [formula], which is a finite set.

Now we go back to our assumption that {Sn:n∈ω} is a collection of nonempty, connected, pairwise disjoint subsets of H such that for m  ≠  n the sets Sn,Sm are connected to each other. We consider just two of these sets, say S0,S1. Because of lemma [\ref=infinite], the sets I(S0) and I(S1) are infinite. For k  =  0,1 let μk  =   min (I(Si)). We may assume that μ0  ≤  μ1. Since I(S0) is infinite, there is n∈I(S0) with n  ≥  μ1. So lemma [\ref=interval] implies that [formula], contradicting the assumption that the Sk are pairwise disjoint. So we established:

The complete graph Kω is not a minor of H.
