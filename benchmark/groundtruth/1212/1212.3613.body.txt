Report

This short document concerns the second data release of the Kepler-INT Survey (KIS, [\citealt=greissetal12]). The Kepler field, a 116 deg2 region of the Cygnus and Lyra constellations, is the target of the most intensive search for transiting planets to date. The Kepler mission provides superior time series photometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability. However, up to the beginning of 2012, its field lacked optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the Kepler instrument. For this reason, in 2011, we followed the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the IPHAS [\citep=drewetal05] and UVEX [\citep=grootetal09] galactic plane surveys in order to produce a deep optical survey of the Kepler field. The initial release catalogue [\citep=greissetal12] concerned data taken between May and August 2011, using the Isaac Newton Telescope on the island of La Palma. Four broadband filters were used, U,g,r,i, as well as one narrowband one, HÎ±, reaching down to a limit of ~  20th mag in the Vega system. Observations covering ~  50 deg2 passed our quality control thresholds and constituted the first data release. Here we report on the second data release, covering an additional ~  63 deg2 of the Kepler field. We apply the exact same quality control criteria and photometric calibration as in the initial release catalogue (see [\citet=greissetal12] for further details). The global photometric calibration was derived by placing the KIS magnitudes as close as possible to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) ones. The second data release catalogue containing ~  14.5 million sources from all the good photometric KIS fields is available for download from the KIS webpage ([formula]), as well as from the Kepler Target Search page at MAST ([formula]). It includes all the objects from the initial data release catalogue and covers ~  97% of the Kepler field. Therefore this release adds ~  8.5 million sources to the initial data release catalogue, all observed between May and August 2012. The remaining ~  3% of the field will be completed once the Kepler field is visible in 2013. Similarly to the initial data release catalogue, the number of sources given does not correspond to the number of unique sources in the catalogue. Around 25% of the sources will have duplicates and a few thousand sources have more than 2 detections in the catalogue.
