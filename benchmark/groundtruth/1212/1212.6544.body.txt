On the unitary part of isometries in commuting, completely non doubly commuting pairs.

Introduction and preliminaries

Let H be a complex Hilbert space and L(H) denotes the algebra of all bounded linear operators acting on H. For operator T∈L(H) by negative power Tn we understand T* |n|. For any subspace L  ⊂  H by PL we understand the orthogonal projection on L. Recall that L reduce T∈L(H) if and only if T commutes with PL. Recall the classical Wold's result [\cite=W]:

Let V∈L(H) be an isometry. There is a unique decomposition of H into orthogonal, reducing for V subspaces

[formula]

such that V|Hu is a unitary operator, V|Hs is a unilateral shift. Moreover

[formula]

[formula]

For a given isometry V∈L(H) subspaces Hu,Hs always mean suitable subspaces in the Wold decomposition given by Theorem [\ref=W]. The restrictions V|Hu,V|Hs we call simply a unitary part and a shift part of an isometry. It arises a natural question about a generalization of Wold result to a pair or a family of operators. The most natural generalization, which following [\cite=CPS] is supposed to be called a multiple canonical Wold decomposition, is obtained in some special cases ([\cite=BKS], [\cite=Sl]). In general case of a pair or a family of commuting isometries there are investigated a multiple Wold type decomposition or models ([\cite=BDF], [\cite=BDF1], [\cite=BCL], [\cite=B0], [\cite=GG], [\cite=GS], [\cite=Pop], [\cite=Su].) Recall that operators T1,T2∈L(H) doubly commute if they commute and T*1T2 = T2T*1. Consider V1,V2∈L(H) a pair of isometries. It can be found a maximal subspace reducing it to a doubly commuting pair. In [\cite=Sl] is described a multiple Wold decomposition in case of doubly commuting pair. Moreover there is given a model of a pair of doubly commuting unilateral shifts. Therefore we consider a completely non doubly commuting pairs (i.e. the only subspace of H reducing V1,V2 to a doubly commuting pair is {0}.) Examples of such pairs are non doubly commuting unilateral shifts or so called modified bi-shift (see [\cite=Pop]). Note that if operators commute and one of them is unitary, then they doubly commute. Thus, in considered completely non doubly commuting pairs each of the isometry has a nontrivial unilateral shift part and a restriction to any nontrivial subspace reducing both operators also have a nontrivial unilateral shift part. However the unitary part may be, but not need to be trivial. There are known examples of undecomposable pairs where unitary part of any isometry is a bilateral shift (mentioned modified bi-shift). In the paper we try to answer the question what kind of unitary operator can be a unitary part of an isometry in a completely non doubly commuting pair.

Multiple Wold decomposition for pairs of isometries

In the chapter we are going to recall more precisely obtained multiple canonical Wold decomposition and a multiple Wold type decompositions. For a definition of a multiple canonical decomposition in general case refer to [\cite=CPS]. In a case of a pair of commuting isometries the definition is as follows:

Suppose V1,  V2 is a pair of isometries on H. The multiple canonical Wold decomposition is given by a decomposition of a Hilbert space

[formula]

where Huu,  Hus,  Hsu,  Hss are reducing subspaces for V1 and V2 such that

V1|Huu,  V2|Huu are unitary operators,

V1|Hus is a unitary operator, V2|Hsu is a unilateral shift,

V1|Hsu is a unilateral shift, V2|Hsu is a unitary operator,

V1|Hss,  V2|Hss are unilateral shifts.

By [\cite=Sl] and [\cite=BKS] there are multiple canonical Wold decompositions for doubly commuting pairs of isometries or if dim  ker V*1  <    ∞   and dim  ker V*2  <    ∞  . However in the general case we have only a weaker result. Recall a definition from [\cite=Pop].

A pair of isometries V1,V2 is called a weak bi-shift if and only if [formula] [formula], and the product isometry V1V2 are shifts.

The following general decomposition of a pair of commuting isometries obtained in [\cite=Pop] is not a canonical one.

For any pair of commuting isometries V1,V2 on H there is a unique decomposition

[formula]

such that Huu,  Hus,  Hsu,  Hws reduce V1 and V2 and

V1|Huu,V2|Huu are unitary operators,

V1|Hus is a unitary operator, V2|Hus is a unilateral shift,

V1|Hsu is a unilateral shift, V2|Hsu is a unitary operator,

V1|Hws,V2|Hws is a weak bi-shift.

[formula]

We are going to focus on a weak bi-shift part. Precisely, we consider a pair of isometries which decomposition given by Theorem [\ref=wbs] trivializes to a weak bi-shift subspace. In such a case the subspace reducing isometries to a doubly commuting pair is trivial or reduces the isometries to a pair of unilateral shifts. Indeed in other case the decomposition of a restriction to a doubly commuting pair of isometries would give a non trivial subspace orthogonal to Hws. By [\cite=Pop] there can be found a maximal subspace of Hws which reduces isometries to a doubly commuting pair of unilateral shifts which model can be found in [\cite=Sl]. Therefore we reduce our interest to a completely non doubly commuting pair of isometries. Such pairs are a case of a weak bi-shift which finer but not fully satisfying decomposition has been described in [\cite=B0].

Decomposition for single isometries

A unitary part of an isometry in a modified bi-shift is a bilateral shift. Our aim is to describe a unitary part of an isometry in a pair of commuting, completely non doubly commuting isometries. In order to answer whether there can be some other operator, note that being a bilateral shift is not a hereditary property. In other words a restrictions of a bilateral shift to some reducing subspace can be not a bilateral shift.

Let H = L2(m) where m denotes the normalized Lebesgue measure on the unit circle [formula]. Let T be the operator of multiplication by the variable ''z'', i.e. (Tf)(z) = zf(z) for f∈L2(m). Let F denotes the spectral measure of T. Then F(α)f = χαf for f∈L2(m). Let α be an entire subarc of Γ and mα be the restriction of m to α. Let Tα be the restriction of T to F(α)H. Since the spectrum σ(Tα) do not contain the whole unit circle the restriction Tα is not a bilateral shift.

Note that a canonical decomposition of an operator T∈L(H) with respect to some property is in fact a construction of a unique maximal reducing subspace Hp  ⊂  H such that the restriction T|Hp has the property. Since being a bilateral shift is not a hereditary property, there is a problem with construction of a maximal subspace reducing operator to a bilateral shift. Example [\ref=e2] in the last section shows that a maximal such subspace is not unique. The construction of a maximal bilateral shift subspace can be done by a construction of a maximal wandering subspace. We follow the idea of wandering vectors from [\cite=B0]. Let G be a semigroup and {Tg}g∈G be a a semigroup of isometries on H. The vector x∈H is called a wandering vector ( for a given semigroup of isometries ) if for any g1,  g2∈G and g1  ≠  g2 holds (Tg1x,Tg2x) = 0. For a semigroup generated by by two commuting isometries we obtain the following definition of a wandering vector.

A vector x∈H is a wandering vector of isometry V∈L(H) if [formula] for every positive n.

Note that for a wandering vector x a vector x + Vx is not wandering. Indeed since x is wandering, then also Vx is wandering. Therefore 〈x + Vx,V(x + Vx)〉  =  〈Vx,Vx〉. Thus the only linear V invariant subspace of wandering vectors is the trivial one. Since we are interested in reducing subspaces, there is no point in considering subspaces of wandering vectors. Instead we consider subspaces generated by wandering vectors. Note that for a wandering vector x we have [formula] for n  ≠  m but only positive. Let [formula] denotes the Wold decomposition of a given isometry V∈L(H). If a wandering vector x∈Hu then [formula] for [formula]. However for x∈Hs is not so clear. On the other hand every vector in the set [formula] is wandering, fulfill the orthogonality condition also for negative powers and generates the whole Hs. Therefore a "weaker" definition of a wandering vector seems to be sufficient.

For any isometry V∈L(H) there is a unique decomposition:

[formula]

reducing operator V such, that

Hw is linear span of wandering vectors,

H0  ⊂  Hu.

Since Hs  ⊂  Hw we need to show only that Hw is V reducing. Obviously Hw is V invariant. Note that for w wandering holds true w,PHsw∈Hw and consequently also PHuw = w - PHsw∈Hw. Note also that [formula] Thus vector x∈Hw if and only if PHux∈Hw. Let us show that PHuV*w∈Hw for arbitrary wandering vector w. Denote wu = PHuw,ws = PHsw for any vector w∈H. By 〈Vnw,w〉  =  〈Vnwu,wu〉  +  〈Vnws,ws〉 vector w is wandering if and only if 〈Vnwu,wu〉 =  - 〈Vnws,ws〉 for every positive n. On the other hand 〈VnV*wu,V*wu〉  =  〈Vnwu,wu〉 =  - 〈Vnws,ws〉. Thus if [formula] is wandering then [formula] is wandering as well. Moreover PHuV*w = V*PHuw = PHuw̃. On the other hand since w̃ is wandering then by previous argumentation PHuw̃∈Hw. Consequently PHuV*w∈Hw. Since w was taken arbitrary wandering and Hw is linearly spanned by wandering vectors, we get V*PHuHw  ⊂  Hw. By the showed inclusion and inclusion Hs  ⊂  Hw we get V*Hw  ⊂  Hw. Consequently Hw reduce V.

Note some property of wandering vectors.

Let V,W∈L(H) is a pair of commuting isometries. Let w be a wandering vector for isometry V. We have

[formula]

for [formula] and hence Wx is also a wandering vector for the isometry V.

As an easy corollary we obtain the following.

The subspace Hw in Theorem [\ref=decthm] is invariant for every isometry commuting with V and H0 is invariant for adjoint of isometry commuting with V.

Let W be any isometry commuting with V. Since Hw is linearly spanned by a set of all V wandering vectors then by Remark [\ref=H0*inv] it is W invariant. Consequently H0 is W* invariant.

Decomposition for pairs of isometries

In this section we take advantage of the showed decomposition and construct a decomposition for pairs of isometries.

Let Hw be a linear span of vectors wandering for V1∈L(H). Consider the decomposition [formula] For any isometry V2∈L(H) commuting with V1 the subspace [formula] reduces V1,V2 and V1 is unitary on it.

It follows directly from the definition of H+0 that it is V1,V2 invariant. Since H0 reduce V1 to a unitary operator then

[formula]

Hence H+0 reduces V1. Note that by formula in Wold decomposition (Theorem [\ref=W]) subspace Hu is hyperinvariant. Thus, by H0  ⊂  Hu follows H+0  ⊂  Hu. Consequently H+0 reduces V1 to a unitary operator.

By Remark [\ref=H0*inv], the subspace H+0 reduces also V2.

Note that the subspace H+0 can be bigger that H0. Moreover, every wandering vector of a unitary operator generates a subspace reducing it to a bilateral shift. Recall Example [\ref=e1]. The whole space H is generated by wandering vectors. On the other hand, in a subspace F(α)H there are no vectors wandering for Tα. Therefore, despite [formula], it is possible that operator [formula] can be nontrivially decomposed by Theorem [\ref=decthm]. However, in such case we can repeat construction of subspace H+01 which is a subspace constructed by Theorem [\ref=H+] for a pair [formula] Define a sequence H0  =  {0} and [formula] for positive n where H+0n is a subspace constructed by Theorem [\ref=H+] for a pair [formula] Note that [formula] is a subspace reducing for V1,V2 and, if H was separable, subspace H0  =  {0} in a decomposition of V1|H1,V2|H1 by Theorem [\ref=H+]. This way we obtain that whole H1 is linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V1. We can now repeat a construction on V1|H1,V2|H1 to obtain subspace linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V2. However the property of being linearly spanned by wandering vectors is not a hereditary property. Thus we obtain a subspace linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V2 but but it might bo no longer linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V1. We solve the problem by other way. Recall form [\cite=B1], that a pair of commuting contractions V1,V2 is called strongly completely non unitary if there is no proper subspace reducing V1,V2 and at least one of them to a unitary operator. Moreover, there is a decomposition theorem ([\cite=B1], Thm. 2.1):

Let T1,T2∈L(H) be a pair of commuting contractions. There is a unique decomposition

[formula]

where subspaces [formula] are maximal such, that:

T1|Huu,T2|Huu are unitary operators,

T1|Hu  ~  u is a unitary operator, [formula] is a completely non unitary operator,

[formula] is a completely non unitary operator, [formula] is a unitary operator,

[formula] is a strongly completely non unitary pair of contractions.

The theorem in case of a pair of commuting isometries leads us to the following decomposition.

Let V1,V2∈L(H) be a pair of commuting isometries. There is a decomposition

[formula]

where

Huu is a maximal subspace reducing V1,V2 to a pair of unitary operators,

Hus is a maximal subspace reducing V1 to a unitary operator and V2 to a unilateral shift,

Hsu is a maximal subspace reducing V1 to a unilateral shift and V2 to a unitary operator,

HS reduce V1,V2 and HS is linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V1 and is linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V2.

Since a completely non unitary isometry is just a unilateral shift, Theorem [\ref=B1] applied for isometries gives a decomposition [formula]. We need to show that [formula] has suitable properties. We prove it for the operator V1. Let [formula] be a decomposition of [formula] obtained by Theorem [\ref=decthm] . By Theorem [\ref=H+] the subspace H0 generates a subspace H+0 which reduces V1 to a unitary operator and reduces V2. Since [formula] reduces V1,V2 it holds true [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] is a strongly completely non unitary pair. Thus H+0  =  {0} and consequently H0  =  {0}. Hence [formula] and is linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V1.

The immediate consequence of the theorem is the following:

Let V1,V2∈L(H) be a pair of commuting, completely non doubly commuting isometries. There are sets W1,W2 of vectors wandering for V1,V2 suitably such that:

[formula]

By the proof of Theorem [\ref=decthm] the projection of a wandering vector on unitary subspace may not be wandering.

Let V∈L(H) be an isometry and w∈H be a wandering vector. Note that for every wandering vector in Hu equality 〈VnPHuw,VmPHuw〉 = 0 holds true for every [formula] Thus the minimal V reducing subspace generated by w is [formula] In other words the minimal V reducing subspace generated by a wandering vector in Hu reduce V to a bilateral shift.

Let us introduce a definition of some class of operators.

We call an operator V∈L(H) a span of bilateral shifts if there are subspaces {Hι}ι∈I such that [formula] and V|Hι is a bilateral shift.

Note that a span of bilateral shifts is a unitary operator.

Let V∈L(H) be an isometry such that H is a linear span of V wandering vectors. The minimal unitary extension U∈L(K) of V is a span of bilateral shifts.

Note that every V wandering vector w∈H becomes U wandering. On the other hand U is unitary. According to Remark [\ref=r2] subspace [formula] is the minimal U reducing subspace generated by w. Since H is linearly spanned by wandering vectors then [formula] where W denotes set of all V wandering vectors. Since Lw  ⊂  K, by minimality of unitary extension we have [formula] On the other hand U|Lw is a bilateral shift which finishes the proof.

Eventually we obtain the following result.

Let V1,V2∈L(H) be a pair of commuting, completely non doubly commuting isometries. The unitary extension of each isometry is a span of bilateral shifts.

Examples

We are going to give a few examples. The first is an example of isometry V∈L(H) such that Hs  ≠  {0} and H is not linearly spanned by wandering vectors.

Denote by f,ei for [formula] the set of orthonormal vectors in some Hilbert space. Define new Hilbert space [formula] and isometry V∈L(H) by Vf = f,Vei = ei + 1 for [formula] Assume that H is linearly spanned by vectors wandering for V. Then there is w a wandering vector, such that PHuw  ≠  0. Obviously [formula] Assume for convenience that w = f + v where [formula] By the proof of Theorem [\ref=decthm] since w is wandering then 〈Vnf,f〉 =  - 〈Vnv,v〉. By the definition of V we obtain [formula] Since v∈Hs then V* nv vanishes to 0. Consequently we obtain a contradiction [formula] Thus H can not be linearly spanned by V wandering vectors.

The next is the example of a span of bilateral shifts which is not a bilateral shift. We would like to thanks Professor László Kérchy for this example.

Let [formula] and U∈L(H) be multiplying by ''z''. If we assume α to be such an subarc that [formula] where [formula] denotes the whole unit circle then H0  =  {0}. If the operator would be unitary equivalent to some bilateral shift then its spectral multiplicities has to be equal. However spectral multiplicity of a bilateral shift is constant, while in our example it is not.

It is clear that wandering vectors of isometry V∈L(H) span the whole subspace Hs. On the other hand by Remark [\ref=r2] wandering vector in a subspace Hu fulfills the orthogonality [formula] for every integer powers. The natural question is what will change if we make a definition of a wandering vector stronger in the following way. We call a wandering vector w strongly wandering if it fulfills the condition [formula] for every [formula] Denote Hws the minimal subspace linearly spanned by strongly wandering vectors and Hw a subspace linearly spanned by wandering vectors. Obviously Hws  ⊂  Hw and both subspaces are reducing for isometry V. As we know subspace Hw is invariant for every isometry commuting with V but Hws does not need to be. Consider the following lemma.

Let V∈L(H) be isometry [formula] denotes its Wold decomposition. Then the following conditions holds.

for x a strongly wandering vector also xu: = PHux,xs: = PHsx are strongly wandering vectors,

[formula] where W,Wu denotes subspaces generated by strongly wandering vectors for V and V|Hu respectively.

Since Hu,Hs reduce V and x is wandering then 〈Vnxu,Vmxu〉 =  - 〈Vnxs,Vmxs〉 for every n  ≠  m. On the other hand

[formula]

for n  ≠  m also n - k  ≠  m - k and consequently

[formula]

Thus xu is a wandering vector and by 〈Vnxu,Vmxu〉 =  - 〈Vnxs,Vmxs〉 also xs is wandering.

For the second part note that Vn( ker V*) for every n  ≥  0 is a set of V wandering vectors. Thus Hs  ⊂  W. Since Hu reduce V every vector wandering for V|Hu is wandering for V. Thus Wu  ⊂  W. By the first part of the lemma follows the reverse inclusion [formula]

We want to show that unitary extension can be a linear span of bilateral shifts and Hilbert space H is not linearly spanned by strongly wandering vectors. Consider the following example.

Consider Example [\ref=e2] and denote [formula] and operator of multiplying by ''z'' by U. Find a wandering subspace W in a bilateral shift [formula] such that [formula] Then take [formula] Restriction U|H is isometry with unitary part equal L2(α) and U is its minimal unitary extension. Since σ(T|Hu) do not contain unit circle, there is no subspace reducing it to a bilateral shift. Consequently Hu do not contain any wandering vector and [formula] On the other hand the unitary extension is a span of bilateral shifts.
