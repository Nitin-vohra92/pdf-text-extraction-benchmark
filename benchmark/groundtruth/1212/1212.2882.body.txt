Introduction

Precision matrix plays a fundamental role in many high-dimensional inference problems. For example, knowledge of the precision matrix is crucial for classification and discriminant analyses. Furthermore, precision matrix is critically useful for a broad range of applications such as portfolio optimization, speech recognition, and genomics. See, for example, Lauritzen (1996), Yuan and Lin (2007), Saon and Chien (2011). Precision matrix is also closely connected to the graphical models which are a powerful tool to model the relationships among a large number of random variables in a complex system and are used in a wide array of scientific applications. It is well known that recovering the structure of an undirected Gaussian graph is equivalent to the recovery of the support of the precision matrix. See for example, Lauritzen (1996), Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2006) and Cai, Liu and Luo (2011). Liu, Lafferty and Wasserman (2009) extended the result to a more general class of distributions called nonparanormal distributions.

The problem of estimating a large precision matrix and recovering its support has drawn considerable recent attention and a number of methods have been introduced. Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2006) proposed a neighborhood selection method for recovering the support of a precision matrix. Penalized likelihood methods have also been introduced for estimating sparse precision matrices. Yuan and Lin (2007) proposed an [formula] penalized normal likelihood estimator and studied its theoretical properties. See also Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani (2008), d'Aspremont, Banerjee and El Ghaoui (2008), Rothman et al. (2008), Lam and Fan (2009), and Ravikumar et al. (2011). Yuan (2010) applied the Dantzig Selector method to estimate the precision matrix and gave the convergence rates for the estimator under the matrix [formula] norm and spectral norm. Cai, Liu and Luo (2011) introduced an estimator called CLIME using a constrained [formula] minimization approach and obtained the rates of convergence for estimating the precision matrix under the spectral norm and Frobenius norm.

Although many methods have been proposed and various rates of convergence have been obtained, it is unclear which estimator is optimal for estimating a sparse precision matrix in terms of convergence rate. This is due to the fact that the minimax rates of convergence, which can serve as a fundamental benchmark for the evaluation of the performance of different procedures, is still unknown. The goals of the present paper are to establish the optimal minimax rates of convergence for estimating a sparse precision matrix under a class of matrix norm losses and to introduce a fully data driven adaptive estimator that is simultaneously rate optimal over a collection of parameter spaces for each loss in this class.

Let [formula] be a random sample from a p-variate distribution with a covariance matrix [formula]. The goal is to estimate the inverse of Σ, the precision matrix [formula]. It is well known that in the high-dimensional setting structural assumptions are needed in order to consistently estimate the precision matrix. The class of sparse precision matrices, where most of the entries in each row/column are zero or negligible, is of particular importance as it is related to sparse graphs in the Gaussian case. For a matrix A and a number 1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  , the matrix [formula] norm is defined as ||A||w  =   sup |x|w  ≤  1|Ax|w. In particular, the commonly used spectral norm is the matrix [formula] norm. For a symmetric matrix A, it is known that the spectral norm [formula] is equal to the largest magnitude of eigenvalues of A. The sparsity of a precision matrix can be modeled by the [formula] balls with 0  ≤  q < 1. More specifically, we define the parameter space Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) by

[formula]

where 0  ≤  q < 1, Mn,p and cn,p are positive and bounded away from 0, M1 > 0 is a given constant, λmax (Ω) and λmin (Ω) are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of Ω respectively, and [formula] for some constants β > 1, c1 > 0 and γ > 0. The notation [formula] means that A is symmetric and positive definite. In the special case of q = 0, a matrix in G0(cn,p,Mn,p) has at most cn,p nonzero elements on each row/column.

Our analysis establishes the minimax rates of convergence for estimating the precision matrices over the parameter space Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) under the matrix [formula] norm losses for 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  . We shall first introduce a new method using an adaptive constrained [formula] minimization approach for estimating the sparse precision matrices. The estimator, called ACLIME, is fully data-driven and easy to implement. The properties of the ACLIME are then studied in detail under the matrix [formula] norm losses. In particular, we establish the rates of convergence for the ACLIME estimator which provide upper bounds for the minimax risks.

A major step in establishing the minimax rates of convergence is the derivation of rate sharp lower bounds. As in the case of estimating sparse covariance matrices, conventional lower bound techniques, which are designed and well suited for problems with parameters that are scalar or vector-valued, fail to yield good results for estimating sparse precision matrices under the spectral norm. In the present paper we apply the "two-directional" lower bound technique first developed in Cai and Zhou (2012) for estimating sparse covariance matrices. This lower bound method can be viewed as a simultaneous application of Assouad's Lemma along the row direction and Le Cam's method along the column direction. The lower bounds match the rates in the upper bounds for the ACLIME estimator and thus yield the minimax rates.

By combining the minimax lower and upper bounds developed in later sections, the main results on the optimal rates of convergence for estimating a sparse precision matrix under various norms can be summarized in the following theorem. We focus here on the exact sparse case of q = 0; the optimal rates for the general case of 0  ≤  q < 1 are given in the end of Section [\ref=lowerbd.sec]. Here for two sequences of positive numbers an and bn, [formula] means that there exist positive constants c and C independent of n such that c  ≤  an / bn  ≤  C.

Let [formula], [formula] and let [formula] The minimax risk of estimating the precision matrix Ω  =  Σ- 1 over the class G0(k,Mn,p) based on the random sample {X1,...,Xn} satisfies

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  .

In view of Theorem [\ref=MinimaxOpe.q0], the ACLIME estimator, which is fully data driven, attains the optimal rates of convergence simultaneously for all k-sparse precision matrices in the parameter spaces G0(k,Mn,p) with [formula] under the matrix [formula] norm for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  . As will be seen in Section [\ref=lowerbd.sec], the adaptivity holds for the general [formula] balls Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) with 0  ≤  q < 1. The ACLIME procedure is thus rate optimally adaptive to both the sparsity patterns and the loss functions.

In addition to its theoretical optimality, the ACLIME estimator is computationally easy to implement for high dimensional data. It can be computed column by column via linear programming and the algorithm is easily scalable. A simulation study is carried out to investigate the numerical performance of the ACLIME estimator. The results show that the procedure performs favorably in comparison to CLIME.

Our work on optimal estimation of precision matrix given in the present paper is closely connected to a growing literature on estimation of large covariance matrices. Many regularization methods have been proposed and studied. For example, Bickel and Levina (2008a, b) proposed banding and thresholding estimators for estimating bandable and sparse covariance matrices respectively and obtained rate of convergence for the two estimators. See also El Karoui (2008) and Lam and Fan (2009). Cai, Zhang and Zhou (2010) established the optimal rates of convergence for estimating bandable covariance matrices. Cai and Yuan (2012) introduced an adaptive block thresholding estimator which is simultaneously rate optimal rate over large collections of bandable covariance matrices. Cai and Zhou (2012) obtained the minimax rate of convergence for estimating sparse covariance matrices under a range of losses including the spectral norm loss. In particular, a new general lower bound technique was developed. Cai and Liu (2011) introduced an adaptive thresholding procedure for estimating sparse covariance matrices that automatically adjusts to the variability of individual entries.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The ACLIME estimator is introduced in detail in Section [\ref=method.sec] and its theoretical properties are studied in Section [\ref=optimality.sec]. In particular, a minimax upper bound for estimating sparse precision matrices is obtained. Section [\ref=lowerbd.sec] establishes a minimax lower bound which matches the minimax upper bound derived in Section [\ref=method.sec] in terms of the convergence rate. The upper and lower bounds together yield the optimal minimax rate of convergence. A simulation study is carried out in Section [\ref=simulation.sec] to compare the performance of the ACLIME with that of the CLIME estimator. Section [\ref=discussion.sec] gives the optimal rate of convergence for estimating sparse precision matrices under the Frobenius norm and discusses connections and differences of our work with other related problems. The proofs are given in Section [\ref=proof.sec].

Methodology

In this section we introduce an adaptive constrained [formula] minimization procedure, called ACLIME, for estimating a precision matrix Ω. The properties of the estimator are then studied in Section [\ref=optimality.sec] under the matrix [formula] norm losses for 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞   and a minimax upper bound is established. The upper bound together with the lower bound given in Section [\ref=lowerbd.sec] will show that the ACLIME estimator is adaptively rate optimal.

We begin with basic notation and definitions. For a vector [formula], define [formula] and [formula]. For a matrix [formula], we define the elementwise [formula] norm by [formula]. The Frobenius norm of A is the elementwise [formula] norm. I denotes a p  ×  p identity matrix. For any two index sets T and [formula] and matrix A, we use [formula] to denote the [formula] matrix with rows and columns of A indexed by T and [formula] respectively.

For an i.i.d. random sample [formula] of p-variate observations drawn from a population X, let the sample mean [formula] and the sample covariance matrix

[formula]

which is an unbiased estimate of the covariance matrix [formula]. It is well known that in the high dimensional setting, the inverse of the sample covariance matrix either does not exist or is not a good estimator of Ω. As mentioned in the introduction, a number of methods for estimating Ω have been introduced in the literature. In particular, Cai, Liu and Luo (2011) proposed an estimator called CLIME by solving the following optimization problem:

[formula]

where [formula] for some constant C. The convex program ([\ref=c1]) can be further decomposed into p vector-minimization problems. Let ei be a standard unit vector in [formula] with 1 in the i-th coordinate and 0 in all other coordinates. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  p, let i be the solution of the following convex optimization problem

[formula]

where ω is a vector in [formula]. The final CLIME estimator of Ω is obtained by putting the columns i together and applying an additional symmetrization step. This estimator is easy to implement and possesses a number of desirable properties as shown in Cai, Liu and Luo (2011).

The CLIME estimator has, however, two drawbacks. One is that the estimator is not rate optimal, as will be shown later. Another drawback is that the procedure is not adaptive in the sense that the tuning parameter λn is not fully specified and needs to be chosen through an empirical method such as cross-validation.

To overcome these drawbacks of CLIME, we now introduce an adaptive constrained [formula]-minimization for inverse matrix estimation (ACLIME). The estimator is fully data-driven and adaptive to the variability of individual entries. A key technical result which provides the motivation for the new procedure is the following fact.

Let [formula] with log p = O(n1 / 3). Set [formula], where [formula] is the sample covariance matrix defined in ([\ref=MLE]). Thenand for all δ  ≥  2,

[formula]

A major step in the construction of the adaptive data-driven procedure is to make the constraint in [\eqref=c1] and [\eqref=o1] adaptive to the variability of individual entries based on Lemma [\ref=var.bnd.lem], instead of using a single upper bound λn for all the entries. In order to apply Lemma [\ref=var.bnd.lem], we need to estimate the diagonal elements of Σ and Ω, σii and wjj, i,j = 1,...,p. Note that σii can be easily estimated by the sample variances [formula], but ωjj are harder to estimate. Hereafter, (A)ij denotes the (i,j)-th entry of the matrix A, (a)j denotes the j-th element of the vector a. Denote [formula].

The ACLIME procedure has two steps: The first step is to estimate ωjj and the second step is to apply a modified version of the CLIME procedure to take into account of the variability of individual entries.

Estimating ωjj. Note that [formula] and [formula]. So the inequality on the left hand side of ([\ref=le1]) can be relaxed to

[formula]

Let [formula] be a solution to the following optimization problem:

[formula]

where [formula], 1  ≤  j  ≤  p, [formula] and

[formula]

Here δ is a constant which can be taken as 2. The estimator 1 yields estimates of the conditional variance ωjj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  p. More specifically, we define the estimates of ωjj by

Adaptive estimation. Given the estimates [formula], the final estimator [formula] of Ω is constructed as follows. First we obtain 1 = :(1ij) by solving p optimization problems: for 1  ≤  j  ≤  p

[formula]

where λn is given in [\eqref=lambdan]. We then obtain the estimator [formula] by symmetrizing 1,

[formula]

We shall call the estimator [formula] adaptive CLIME, or ACLIME. The estimator adapts to the variability of individual entries by using an entry-dependent threshold for each individual ωij. Note that the optimization problem ([\ref=le3]) is convex and can be cast as a linear program. The constant δ in [\eqref=lambdan] can be taken as 2 and the resulting estimator will be shown to be adaptively minimax rate optimal for estimating sparse precision matrices.

Note that δ = 2 used in the constraint sets is tight, it can not be further reduced in general. If one chooses the constant δ < 2, then with probability tending to 1, the true precision matrix will no longer belong to the feasible sets. To see this, consider Σ  =  Ω = Ip  ×  p for simplicity. It follows from Liu, Lin and Shao (2008) and Cai and Jiang (2011) that

[formula]

in probability. Thus P(|Ω - Ip  ×  p|∞  >  λn)  →  1, which means that if δ < 2, the true Ω lies outside of the feasible set with high probability and solving the corresponding minimization problem cannot lead to a good estimator of Ω.

The CLIME estimator uses a universal tuning parameter [formula] which does not take into account the variations in the variances σii and the conditional variances ωjj. It will be shown that the convergence rate of CLIME obtained by Cai, Liu and Luo (2011) is not optimal. The quantity Mn,p is the upper bound of the matrix [formula] norm which is unknown in practice. The cross validation method can be used to choose the tuning parameter in CLIME. However, the estimator obtained through CV can be variable and its theoretical properties are unclear. In contrast, the ACLIME procedure proposed in the present paper does not depend on any unknown parameters and it will be shown that the estimator is minimax rate optimal.

Properties of ACLIME and Minimax Upper Bounds

We now study the properties of the ACLIME estimator [formula] proposed in Section [\ref=method.sec]. We shall begin with the Gaussian case where X  ~  N(μ,Σ). Extensions to non-Gaussian distributions will be discussed later. The following result shows that the ACLIME estimator adaptively attains the convergence rate of over the class of sparse precision matrices Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) defined in [\eqref=parameterspace] under the matrix [formula] norm losses for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  . The lower bound given in Section [\ref=lowerbd.sec] shows that this rate is indeed optimal and thus ACLIME adapts to both sparsity patterns and this class of loss functions.

Suppose we observe a random sample [formula]. Let Ω  =  Σ- 1 be the precision matrix. Let δ  ≥  2, log p = O(n1 / 3) and

[formula]

Then for some constant C > 0 for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  .

For q = 0 a sufficient condition for estimating Ω consistently under the spectral norm is This implies that the total number of nonzero elements on each column needs be [formula] in order for the precision matrix to be estimated consistently over G0(cn,p,Mn,p). In Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm] we show that the upper bound [formula] is indeed rate optimal over G0(cn,p,Mn,p).

We now consider the rate of convergence under the expectation. For technical reasons, we require the constant δ  ≥  3 in this case.

Suppose we observe a random sample [formula]. Let Ω  =  Σ- 1 be the precision matrix. Let log p = O(n1 / 3) and δ  ≥  3. Suppose that p  ≥  n13 / (δ2 - 8) and The ACLIME estimator [formula] satisfies, for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞   and 0  ≤  q  <  1, for some constant C > 0.

Theorem [\ref=cminiupp] can be extended to non-Gaussian distributions. Let [formula] be a p - variate random variable with mean μ and covariance matrix [formula]. Let [formula] be the precision matrix. Define Yi = (Zi  -  μi) / σ1 / 2ii, 1  ≤  i  ≤  p and [formula]. Assume that there exist some positive constants η and M such that for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  p,

[formula]

Then we have the following result.

Suppose we observe an i.i.d. sample X1,...,Xn with the precision matrix Ω satisfying Condition ([\ref=T1]). Let log p = O(n1 / 3), p  ≥  nγ for some γ > 0. Suppose that

[formula]

Then there is a δ depending only on η, M and γ such that the ACLIME estimator [formula] satisfies, for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞   and 0  ≤  q < 1,

[formula]

for some constant C > 0.

Under Condition ([\ref=T1]) it can be shown that an analogous result to Lemma [\ref=var.bnd.lem] in Section [\ref=method.sec] holds with some δ depending only on η and M. Thus, it can be proved that, under Condition ([\ref=T1]), Theorem [\ref=Generalupp] holds. The proof is similar to that of Theorem [\ref=cminiupp]. A practical way to choose δ is using cross validation.

Theorems [\ref=cth1-1], [\ref=cminiupp] and [\ref=Generalupp] follow mainly from the convergence rate under the element-wise [formula] norm and the inequality ||M||w  ≤  ||M||1 for any symmetric matrix M from Lemma [\ref=lwl2]. The convergence rate under element-wise norm plays an important role in graphical model selection and in establishing the convergence rate under other matrix norms, such as the Frobenius norm [formula]. Indeed, from the proof, Theorems [\ref=cth1-1], [\ref=cminiupp] and [\ref=Generalupp] hold under the matrix [formula] norm. More specifically, under the conditions of Theorems [\ref=cminiupp] and [\ref=Generalupp] we have

[formula]

The results in this section can be easily extended to the weak [formula] ball with 0  ≤  q < 1 to model the sparsity of the precision matrix Ω. A weak [formula] ball of radius c in Rp is defined as follows, where |ξ|(1)  ≥   [formula] |ξ|(p). Let

[formula]

Theorems [\ref=cth1-1], [\ref=cminiupp] and [\ref=Generalupp] hold with the parameter space Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) replaced by [formula] by a slight extension of Lemma [\ref=le5] for the [formula] ball to for the weak [formula] ball similar to Equation (51) in Cai and Zhou (2012).

Minimax Lower Bounds

Theorem [\ref=cminiupp] shows that the ACLIME estimator adaptively attains the rate of convergence

[formula]

under the squared matrix [formula] norm loss for 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞   over the collection of the parameter spaces Gq(cn,p,Mn,p). In this section we shall show that the rate of convergence given in [\eqref=opt.rate] cannot be improved by any other estimator and thus is indeed optimal among all estimators by establishing minimax lower bounds for estimating sparse precision matrices under the squared matrix [formula] norm.

Let [formula] with p > c1nβ for some constants β > 1 and c1 > 0. Assume that

[formula]

for some constant c > 0. The minimax risk for estimating the precision matrix Ω  =  Σ- 1 over the parameter space Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) under the condition ([\ref=cnp]) satisfies for some constant C > 0 and for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  .

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm] is involved. We shall discuss the key technical tools and outline the important steps in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm] in this section. The detailed proof is given in Section [\ref=proof.sec].

A General Technical Tool

We use a lower bound technique introduced in Cai and Zhou (2012), which is particularly well suited for treating two-directional problems such as matrix estimation. The technique can be viewed as a generalization of both Le Cam's method and Assouad's Lemma, two classical lower bound arguments. Let X be an observation from a distribution [formula] where θ belongs to a parameter set Θ which has a special tensor structure. For a given positive integer r and a finite set [formula], let [formula] and Λ  ⊆  Br. Define

[formula]

In comparison, the standard lower bound arguments work with either Γ or Λ alone. For example, the Assouad's Lemma considers only the parameter set Γ and the Le Cam's method typically applies to a parameter set like Λ with r = 1. Cai and Zhou (2012) gives a lower bound for the maximum risk over the parameter set Θ to the problem of estimating a functional ψ(θ), belonging to a metric space with metric d.

We need to introduce a few notations before formally stating the lower bound. For two distributions [formula] and [formula] with densities p and q with respect to any common dominating measure μ, the total variation affinity is given by [formula]. For a parameter γ = (γ1,...,γr)∈Γ where γi∈{0,1}, define

[formula]

be the Hamming distance on [formula].

Let DΛ  =  Card[formula]. For a given a∈{0,1} and 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, we define the mixture distribution [formula] by

[formula]

So [formula] is the mixture distribution over all Pθ with γi(θ) fixed to be a while all other components of θ vary over all possible values. In our construction of the parameter set for establishing the minimax lower bound, r is the number of possibly non-zero rows in the upper triangle of the covariance matrix, and Λ is the set of matrices with r rows to determine the upper triangle matrix.

For any estimator T of ψ(θ) based on an observation from the experiment [formula], and any s > 0

[formula]

where [formula] is defined in Equation ([\ref=avepi]) and α is given by

[formula]

We introduce some new notations to study the affinity [formula] in Equation ([\ref=rhsLemma1]). Denote the projection of θ∈Θ to Γ by [formula] and to Λ by [formula]. More generally we define [formula] for a subset [formula], a projection of θ to a subset of Γ. A particularly useful example of set A is for which [formula]. [formula] and [formula] are defined similarly. We denote the set [formula] by ΛA. For [formula], [formula], and c∈Λ- i  ⊆  Br - 1, letand define

[formula]

In other words, [formula] is the mixture distribution over all [formula] with λi(θ) varying over all possible values while all other components of θ remain fixed.

The following lemma gives a lower bound for the affinity in Equation ([\ref=rhsLemma1]). See SEction 2 of Cai and Zhou (2012) for more details.

Let [formula] and [formula] be defined in Equation ([\ref=avepi])and ([\ref=avepibd]) respectively, then where the average over γ- i and λ- i is induced by the uniform distribution over Θ.

Lower Bound for Estimating Sparse Precision Matrix

We now apply the lower bound technique developed in Section [\ref=Glowbd.sec] to establish rate sharp results under the matrix [formula] norm. Let [formula] with p > c1nβ for some β > 1 and c1 > 0, where Ω∈ Gq(cn,p,Mn,p). The proof of Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm] contains four major steps. We first reduce the minimax lower bound under the general matrix [formula] norm, 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  , to under the spectral norm. In the second step we construct in detail a subset [formula] of the parameter space Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) such that the difficulty of estimation over [formula] is essentially the same as that of estimation over Gq(cn,p,Mn,p), the third step is the application of Lemma [\ref=AL] to the carefully constructed parameter set, and finally in the fourth step we calculate the factors α defined in ([\ref=alpha]) and the total variation affinity between two multivariate normal mixtures. We outline the main ideas of the proof here and leave detailed proof of some technical results to Section [\ref=proof.sec].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm]: We shall divide the proof into four major steps.

Step 1: Reducing the general problem to the lower bound under the spectral norm. The following lemma implies that the minimax lower bound under the spectral norm yields a lower bound under the general matrix [formula] norm up to a constant factor 4.

Let [formula], and F be any parameter space of precision matrices. The minimax risk for estimating the precision matrix Ω over F satisfies

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  .

Step 2: Constructing the parameter set. Let r = ⌈p / 2⌉ and let B be the collection of all vectors [formula] such that bj = 0 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  p - r and bj = 0 or 1 for p - r + 1  ≤  j  ≤  p under the constraint [formula] (to be defined later). For each b∈B and each 1  ≤  m  ≤  r, define a p  ×  p matrix λm(b) by making the mth row of λm(b) equal to b and the rest of the entries 0. It is clear that Card(B)[formula]. Set [formula]. Note that each component bi of λ = (b1,...,br)∈Λ can be uniquely associated with a p  ×  p matrix λi(bi). Λ is the set of all matrices λ with the every column sum less than or equal to 2k. Define [formula] and let [formula] be fixed. (The exact value of εn,p will be chosen later.) For each θ = (γ,λ)∈Θ with γ = (γ1,...,γr) and λ = (b1,...,br), we associate θ with a precision matrix Ω(θ) by Finally we define a collection [formula] of precision matrices as We now specify the values of εn,p and k. Set

[formula]

and

[formula]

which is at least 1 from Equation ([\ref=epsilonnp]). Now we show [formula] is a subset of the parameter space Gq(cn,p,Mn,p). From the definition of k in ([\ref=kdef]) note that

[formula]

From Equation ([\ref=cnp]) we have [formula], which implies

[formula]

then

[formula]

Since [formula], we havewhich implies that every Ω(θ) is diagonally dominant and positive definite, and

[formula]

which immediately implies

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=qnorm]), ([\ref=1norm]), ([\ref=posi]) and ([\ref=cond]) all together imply [formula].

Step 3: Applying the general lower bound argument. Let [formula] with θ∈Θ and denote the joint distribution by Pθ. Applying Lemmas [\ref=AL] and [\ref=aff] to the parameter space Θ, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] and [formula] are defined as in ([\ref=avepi]).

Step 4: Bounding the per comparison loss α defined in ([\ref=alpha1]) and the affinity [formula] in ([\ref=lowerbound*]). This is done separately in the next two lemmas which are proved in detailed in Section [\ref=proof.sec].

The per comparison loss α defined in ([\ref=alpha1]) satisfies

Let [formula] with θ∈Θ and denote the joint distribution by [formula]. For a∈{0,1} and 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, define [formula] as in ([\ref=avepibd]). Then there exists a constant c1 > 0 such that

Finally, the minimax lower bound for estimating a sparse precision matrix over the collection Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) is obtained by putting together ([\ref=lowerbound*]) and Lemmas [\ref=dffbd] and [\ref=affbd],

[formula]

for some constant c2 > 0.

Putting together the minimax upper and lower bounds in Theorems [\ref=cminiupp] and [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm] as well as Remark [\ref=weak.lq.remark] yields the optimal rates of convergence for estimating Ω over the collection of the [formula] balls Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) defined in ([\ref=parameterspace]) as well as the collection of the weak [formula] balls G*q(cn,p,Mn,p) defined in [\eqref=weak.lq.ball].

Suppose we observe a random sample [formula], [formula]. Let Ω  =  Σ- 1 be the precision matrix. Assume that log p = O(n1 / 3) and

[formula]

for some constant c > 0. Then

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  , where G  =  Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) or G*q(cn,p,Mn,p).

Numerical results

In this section, we consider the numerical performance of ACLIME. In particular, we shall compare the performance of ACLIME with that of CLIME. The following three graphical models are considered. Let [formula], where Ui, 1  ≤  i  ≤  p, are i.i.d. uniform random variables on the interval (1,5). Let Σ  =  Ω- 1 = DΩ- 11D. The matrix D makes the diagonal entries in Σ and Ω different.

Band graph. Let Ω1 = (ωij), where ωii = 1, ωi,i + 1  =  ωi + 1,i = 0.6, ωi,i + 2  =  ωi + 2,i = 0.3, ωij = 0 for |i - j|  ≥  3.

AR(1) model. Let Ω1 = (ωij), where ωij = (0.6)|j - i|.

Erdös-Rényi random graph. Let Ω2 = (ωij), where ωij = uij  *  δij, δij is the Bernoulli random variable with success probability 0.05 and uij is uniform random variable with distribution U(0.4,0.8). We let Ω1  =  Ω2 + (| min (λmin)| + 0.05)Ip. It is easy to check that the matrix Ω1 is symmetric and positive definite.

We generate n = 200 random training samples from Np(0,Σ) distribution for p = 50,100,200. For ACLIME, we set δ = 2 in Step 1 and choose δ in Step 2 by a cross validation method. To this end, we generate an additional 200 testing samples. The tuning parameter in CLIME is selected by cross validation. Note that ACLIME chooses different tuning parameters for different columns and CLIME chooses a universal tuning parameter. The log-likehood loss

[formula]

where 1 is the sample covariance matrix of the testing samples, is used in the cross validation method. For δ in ([\ref=lambdan]), we let δ  =  δj = j / 50, 1  ≤  j  ≤  100. For each δj, ACLIME (δj) is obtained and the tuning parameter δ in ([\ref=lambdan]) is selected by minimizing the following log-likehood loss

[formula]

The tuning parameter λn in CLIME is also selected by cross validation. The detailed steps can be found in Cai, Liu and Luo (2011).

The empirical errors of ACLIME and CLIME estimators under various settings are summarized in Table [\ref=tb:simu] below. Three losses under the spectral norm, matrix [formula] norm and Frobenius norm are given to compare the performance between ACLIME and CLIME. As can be seen from Table [\ref=tb:simu], ACLIME, which is tuning-free, outperforms CLIME in most of the cases for each of the three graphs.

Discussions

We established in this paper the optimal rates of convergence and introduced an adaptive method for estimating sparse precision matrices under the matrix [formula] norm losses for 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  . The minimax rate of convergence under the Frobenius norm loss can also be easily established. As seen in the proof of Theorems [\ref=cth1-1] and [\ref=cminiupp], with probability tending to one,

[formula]

for some constant C > 0. From Equation ([\ref=infinitybound]) one can immediately obtain the following risk upper bound under the Frobenius norm, which can be shown to be rate optimal using a similar proof to that of Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm].

Suppose we observe a random sample [formula], [formula]. Let Ω  =  Σ- 1 be the precision matrix. Under the assumption ([\ref=cond.c]), the minimax risk of estimating the precision matrix Ω over the class Gq(cn,p,Mn,p) defined in ([\ref=parameterspace]) satisfies

[formula]

As shown in Theorem [\ref=MinimaxOpe], the optimal rate of convergence for estimating sparse precision matrices under the squared [formula] norm loss is [formula]. It is interesting to compare this with the minimax rate of convergence for estimating sparse covariance matrices under the same loss which is [formula] (cf. Theorem 1 in Cai and Zhou (2012)). These two convergence rates are similar, but have an important distinction. The difficulty of estimating a sparse covariance matrix does not depend on the [formula] norm bound Mn,p, while the difficulty of estimating a sparse precision matrix does.

As mentioned in the introduction, an important related problem to the estimation of precision matrix is the recovery of a Gaussian graph which is equivalent to the estimation of the support of Ω. Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph representing the conditional independence relations between the components of a random vector X. The vertex set V contains the components of X, [formula]. The edge set E consists of ordered pairs (i,j), indicating conditional dependence between the components Vi and Vj. An edge between Vi and Vj is in the set E, i.e., (i,j)∈E, if and only ωij = 0. The adaptive CLIME estimator, with an additional thresholding step, can recover the support of Ω. Define the estimator of the support of Ω by

[formula]

where the choice of τij depends on the bound |ij  -  ωij|. Equation ([\ref=infinitybound]) implies that the right threshold levels are [formula]. If the magnitudes of the nonzero entries exceed [formula], then [formula] recovers the support of Ω exactly. In the context of covariance matrix estimation, Cai and Liu (2011) introduced an adaptive entry-dependent thresholding procedure to recover the support of Σ. That method is based on the sharp bound

[formula]

where ij is an estimator of Var((Xi  -  μi)(Xj  -  μj)). It is natural to ask whether one can use data and entry-dependent threshold levels τij to recover the support of Ω. It is clearly that the optimal choice of τij depends on the sharp bounds for |ij  -  ωij| which are much more difficult to establish than in the covariance matrix case.

Several recent papers considered the estimation of nonparanormal graphical models where the population distribution is non-Gaussian, see Xue and Zou (2012) and Liu, et al. (2012). The nonparanormal model assumes that the variables follow a joint normal distribution after a set of unknown marginal monotone transformations. Xue and Zou (2012) estimated the nonparanormal model by applying CLIME (and graphical lasso, neighborhood Dantzig selector) to the adjusted Spearman's rank correlations. ACLIME can also be used in such a setting. It would be interesting to investigate the properties of the resulting estimator under the nonparanormal model. Detailed analysis is involved and we leave this as future work.

Proofs

In this section we prove the main results, Theorems [\ref=cth1-1] and [\ref=cminiupp], and the key technical results, Lemmas [\ref=reduction], [\ref=dffbd] and [\ref=affbd], used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Operlower.bd.thm]. The proof of Lemma [\ref=affbd] is involved. We begin by proving Lemma [\ref=var.bnd.lem] stated in Section [\ref=method.sec] and collecting a few additional technical lemmas that will be used in the proofs of the main results.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=var.bnd.lem] and Additional Technical Lemmas

Proof of Lemma [\ref=var.bnd.lem] Let [formula]. Note that Σ* has the same distribution as that of Σ̃ with Xk  ~  N(0,Σ). So we can replace Σ* in Section 2 by Σ̃n  =  Σ̃ + n- 1Ip  ×  p and assume Xk  ~  N(0,Σ). Let [formula] and set [formula]. It suffices to prove that with probability greater than An,

[formula]

Note that [formula], [formula] and [formula] for i  ≠  j. So Xki and [formula] are independent. Hence, [formula]. By Theorem 5.23 and (5.77) in Petrov (1995), we have

[formula]

We next prove the second inequality in ([\ref=a6]). We have [formula] and [formula]. Note that [formula] for some absolute constants t0 and c0. By Theorem 5.23 in Petrov (1995),

[formula]

Since [formula], we have σjjωjj  ≥  1. This, together with ([\ref=a1]) and ([\ref=a2]), yields ([\ref=a6]).

Let [formula] be any estimator of Ω and set tn = |  -  Ω|∞. Then on the event

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Proof. Define Then which implies that |h2j|1  ≤  |h1j|1. This follows that |hj|1  ≤  2|h1j|1. So we only need to upper bound |h1j|1. We have

[formula]

So ([\ref=a44]) holds.

The following Lemma is a classical result. It implies that, if we only consider estimators of symmetric matrices, an upper bound under the matrix [formula] norm is an upper bound for the general matrix [formula] norm for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  , and a lower bound under the matrix [formula] norm is also a lower bound for the general matrix [formula] norm. We give a proof to this lemma to be self-contained.

Let A be a symmetric matrix, then for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  .

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lwl2]. The Riesz-Thorin Interpolation Theorem (See, e.g., Thorin, 1948) implies

[formula]

Set w1 = 1 and w2  =    ∞  , then Equation ([\ref=RT]) yields [formula] for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞  . When A is symmetric, we know [formula], then immediately we have [formula]. Since 2 is sandwiched between w and [formula], and [formula] by duality, from Equation ([\ref=RT]) we have [formula] for all 1  ≤  w  ≤    ∞   when A symmetric.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=cth1-1] and [\ref=cminiupp]

We first prove Theorem [\ref=cth1-1]. From Lemma [\ref=lwl2] it is enough to consider the w = 1 case. By Lemma 1, we have with probability greater than An,

[formula]

We first assume that [formula]. By the above inequality, with probability greater than An. Because λmax(Ω) / λmin(Ω)  ≤  M1, we have max iω- qii  ≤  2(n /  log p)q / 2. Thus by the conditions in Theorems [\ref=cminiupp] and [\ref=cth1-1], we have with probability greater than An. By ([\ref=a6]), we can see that, under conditions of Theorem 2, Ω belongs to the feasible set in ([\ref=op1]) with probability greater than An. Under conditions of Theorem 3, Ω belongs to the feasible set in ([\ref=op1]) with probability greater than [formula]. So by a similar argument as in ([\ref=a7]), we can get [formula] and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=le5], we see that

[formula]

We consider the case [formula]. Under this setting, we have [formula] with probability greater than An. Hence [formula] and Ω belongs to the feasible set in ([\ref=op1]) with probability greater than An. So [formula]. This proves Theorem [\ref=cth1-1].

To prove Theorem [\ref=cminiupp], note that [formula]. We have

[formula]

This proves Theorem [\ref=cminiupp].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=reduction]

We first show that the minimax lower bound over all possible estimators is at the same order of the minimax lower over only estimators of symmetric matrices under each matrix [formula] norm. For each estimator [formula], we define a projection of [formula] to the parameter space F, which is symmetric, then

[formula]

where the first inequality follows from the triangle inequality and the second one follows from the definition of project. Since Equation ([\ref=symmest1]) holds for every [formula], we have

From Lemma [\ref=lwl2], we havewhich, together with Equation ([\ref=symmest1]), establishes Lemma [\ref=reduction].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=dffbd]

Let [formula] be a column vector with length p, and i.e., [formula]. Set Note that for each i, if [formula], we have [formula]. Then there are at least [formula] number of elements wi with [formula], which impliesSince [formula], the equation above yields i.e.,when [formula].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=affbd]

Without loss of generality we assume that Mn,p is a constant, since the total variance affinity is scale invariant. The proof of the bound for the affinity given in Lemma [\ref=affbd] is involved. We break the proof into a few major technical lemmas Without loss of generality we consider only the case i = 1 and prove that there exists a constant c2 > 0 such that [formula]. The following lemma turns the problem of bounding the total variation affinity into a chi-square distance calculation on Gaussian mixtures. Define which is the set of all values of the upper triangular matrix [formula] could possibly take, with the first row leaving out.

If there is  a constant c2 < 1 such that

[formula]

then [formula].

From the definition of [formula] in Equation ([\ref=avepibd]) and θ in Equation ([\ref=theta]), γ1 = 0 implies [formula] is a single multivariate normal distribution with a precision matrix,

[formula]

where [formula] is uniquely determined by [formula] withLet which gives the set of all possible values of the first row with rest of rows given, i.e., λ- 1(θ) = c, and define [formula], the cardinality of all possible λ1 such that [formula] for the given λ- 1. Then from definitions in Equations ([\ref=avepibd]) and ([\ref=theta]) [formula] is an average of [formula] multivariate normal distributions with precision matrices of the following form

[formula]

where [formula] with nonzero elements of r equal εn,p and the submatrix [formula] is the same as the one for Σ0 given in ([\ref=sigma0]). It is helpful to observe that pλ- 1  ≥  p / 4. Let nλ- 1 be the number of columns of λ- 1 with column sum equal to 2k for which the first row has no choice but to take value 0 in this column. Then we have [formula]. Since [formula], the total number of 1's in the upper triangular matrix by the construction of the parameter set, we thus have [formula], which immediately implies [formula].

With Lemma [\ref=chisquares.lem] in place, it remains to establish Equation ([\ref=chi-squarebd]) in order to prove Lemma [\ref=affbd]. The following lemma is useful for calculating the cross product terms in the chi-square distance between Gaussian mixtures. The proof of the lemma is straightforward and is thus omitted.

Let gi be the density function of [formula] for i = 0,1 and 2. Then

Let Ωi, i = 1 or 2, be two precision matrices of the form ([\ref=matrix.form]). Note that Ωi, i = 0,1 or 2, differs from each other only in the first row/column. Then Ωi  -  Ω0, i = 1 or 2, has a very simple structure. The nonzero elements only appear in the first row/column, and in total there are 2k nonzero elements. This property immediately implies the following lemma which makes the problem of studying the determinant in Lemma [\ref=crossproduct] relatively easy.

Let Ωi, i = 1 and 2, be the precision matrices of the form ([\ref=matrix.form]). Define J to be the number of overlapping εn,p's between Ω1 and Ω2 on the first row, and There are index subsets Ir and Ic in [formula] with [formula] and [formula] such that and the matrix [formula] has rank 2 with two identical nonzero eigenvalues Jε2n,p.

Let

[formula]

where Ω0 is defined in ([\ref=sigma0]) and determined by [formula], and Ω1 and Ω2 have the first row λ1 and [formula] respectively. We drop the indices λ1, [formula] and [formula] from Ωi to simplify the notations. Define

[formula]

It is a subset of Θ- 1 in which the element can pick both a1 and a2 as the first row to form parameters in Θ. From Lemma [\ref=crossproduct] the left hand side of Equation ([\ref=chi-squarebd]) can be written as

[formula]

The following result shows that [formula] is approximately [formula] which is equal to [formula] from Lemma [\ref=sigmai].  Define

For [formula] defined in Equation ([\ref=R]) we have

[formula]

where [formula] satisfies

[formula]

where J is defined in Lemma [\ref=sigmai].

Proof of Equation ([\ref=chi-squarebd])

We are now ready to establish Equation ([\ref=chi-squarebd]) which is the key step in proving Lemma [\ref=affbd]. It follows from Equation ([\ref=Rdecomp]) in Lemma [\ref=R.lem] that

[formula]

Recall that J is the number of overlapping εn,p's between Σ1 and Σ2 on the first row. It can be shown that J has the hypergeometric distribution with

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=plambda]) and Lemma [\ref=R.lem], togetehr with Equation ([\ref=epsilonnp]), imply

[formula]

where the last step follows from [formula] and [formula] from Equations ([\ref=kdef]) and ([\ref=cnp]) and the condition p > c1nβ for some β > 1, and c2 is a positive constant.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=R.lem]

Let

[formula]

Since [formula] from Equation([\ref=kepsilon]), it is easy to see that

[formula]

DefineThen we can rewrite [formula] as follows

[formula]

where the last equation follows from Lemma [\ref=sigmai]. To establish Lemma [\ref=R.lem] it is enough to establish Equation ([\ref=R1.eq]).

Let

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Similar to Equation ([\ref=Aeig]), we have [formula], and writeTo establish Equation ([\ref=R1.eq]), it is enough to show that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

The proof for Equation ([\ref=A1bd]) is as follows. Writewhere [formula] satisfies vj = 0 for 2  ≤  j  ≤  p - r and vj = 0 or 1 for p - r + 1  ≤  j  ≤  p with [formula], and [formula] satisfies a similar property. Without loss of generality we consider only a special case with Note that B1 can be written as a polynomial of Ω1  -  Ω0 and Ω2  -  Ω0, and B2 can be written as a polynomial of [formula] By a straightforward calculation it can be shown thatand where [formula], which impliesNote that [formula] due to the simple structure of [formula]. Let [formula] withand [formula] by eliminating the non-zero off-diagonal elements of the first row and column of A1, and We can show that all eigenvalues of [formula] are [formula]. Since [formula] then which impliesThus

Now we establish Equation ([\ref=A1Abd]), which, together with Equation ([\ref=A1bd]), yields Equation ([\ref=R1.eq]) and thus Lemma [\ref=R.lem] is established. Write

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is important to observe that [formula] again due to the simple structure of [formula], then [formula] is determined by at most two nonzero eigenvalues, which are bounded by

[formula]

Note that [formula], andwhich impliesi.e.,Definethenfrom Equations ([\ref=AStartbd]). It is then sufficient to show

where [formula] depends on the values of [formula] and [formula]. We dropped the indices λ1, [formula] and [formula] from A to simplify the notations.

Let [formula]. Let nλEm be the number of columns of λEm with column sum at least 2k - 2 for which two rows can not freely take value 0 or 1 in this column. Then we have [formula]. Without loss of generality we assume that k  ≥  3. Since [formula], the total number of 1's in the upper triangular matrix by the construction of the parameter set, we thus have [formula], which immediately implies [formula]. Thus we have

[formula]

from Equation ([\ref=plambda]), which immediately implies

[formula]

where the last step is an immediate consequence of the following two equations,and which follow from [formula] from Equation ([\ref=kdef]) and the condition p > c1nβ for some β > 1.
