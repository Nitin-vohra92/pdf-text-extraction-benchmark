New Massive Gravity on de Sitter Space and Black Holes at the Special Point

Introduction

A fully nonlinear covariant theory of massive gravity in 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime, dubbed New Massive Gravity (NMG), has been introduced in Ref. [\cite=Bergshoeff:2009hq]. At the linearized level, the theory is equivalent to the Fierz-Pauli action (FP) for a massive spin-2 field. It also passes highly nontrivial consistency checks at the nonlinear level[\cite=alas] [\cite=Gabadadzeetal].

In this note, we revisit the formulation of NMG on de Sitter (dS) spacetime. We analyze the theory linearized about dS and study the appearance of an enhanced symmetry at a special point of the parameter space, similarly as it happens in FP gravity on dS [\cite=Deser:1983mm] [\cite=Higuchi:1986py] [\cite=Deser:2001pe] [\cite=Gabadadze:2008uc]. This symmetry enhancement has also been observed in Ref. [\cite=Belgrado] within the canonical approach; here, we go further by relating this symmetry with the existence of dS black holes at the very special point of the parameter space.

New massive gravity on de Sitter space

The action of NMG is given by [\cite=Bergshoeff:2009hq]

[formula]

The square-curvature terms K satisfy the remarkable property gμνδK / δgμν = K, which is important for the unitarity of the theory about flat background.

The equations of motion derived from ([\ref=action]) admit dS spacetime as exact solution provided λ  ≤  m2, with the Hubble constant [formula].

We consider perturbations of the form gμν  =  γμν + hμν, where γμν denotes the metric of dS3 space. We denote the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric by [formula] and [formula] by [formula]. It is possible to choose transverse traceless gauge [formula] h = γμνhμν = 0, and the equations of motion read

[formula]

where we used that [formula]. Interestingly, the equations ([\ref=eomtt]) factorize into

[formula]

This splits the space of solutions into two: the General Relativity modes, hμν, that solve equation [formula], and the massive mode, h̃μν, that solves [formula]. In the limit m  →    ∞  , the latter decouples.

Conformal symmetry at the special point

Here, we will be concerned with the special points λ = m2, that is H2 = 2m2. At this point, the theory exhibits a special property. To see this, consider the variation of action ([\ref=action]) under the transformation

[formula]

for an arbitrary function φ. Up to a total derivative, the variation of the action is

[formula]

We see that, if λ = m2 (equivalently, H2 = 2m2), the variation does vanish for arbitrary φ; therefore, at this point the linarized theory exhibits a symmetry enhancement. This is reminiscent of the special point of FP gravity on dS. In the case of FP theory, the enhanced symmetry is of the form [formula]. NMG is generally covariant, so that the term [formula] represents a symmetry by itself; it is the γμνφ term that becomes enhanced at λ = m2.

Black holes at the special point

It turns out that, at λ = m2, NMG exhibits another peculiar property: it admits dS black hole solutions [\cite=Bergshoeff:2009aq] [\cite=Oliva:2009ip]. The metrics is

[formula]

where b and μ are two arbitrary parameters. In the range 0 < μ  ≤  b2, metric ([\ref=bhmetric]) describes a black hole that asymptotes dS3 spacetime. The black hole exhibits a curvature singularity at the origin, it being covered by an event horizon located at [formula]. The cosmological horizon of dS3 space is located at [formula].

Considering b as small parameter and expanding to linear order one gets

[formula]

where g0μν corresponds to metric ([\ref=bhlin]) with b = 0. Now, we observe that a special combination of a conformal symmetry and coordinate transformations of the form

[formula]

precisely cancels the terms proportional to b in ([\ref=bhlin]). This means that ([\ref=bhlin]) can be generated by a transformation ([\ref=delg]). At the nonlinear level, the symmetry ([\ref=delg]) is absent.

Away from the special point, the linear analysis of NMG reveals the existence of a non-propagating tensor mode of 3D massless General Relativity, as well as the helicity-2, helicity-1, and the helicity-0 modes of a 3D massive graviton (helicity-2 being nondynamical). In contrast, at the special point, the kinetic term of the helicity-0 mode vanishes, and it becomes infinitely strongly coupled since the corresponding conformal symmetry is present at the linear level only. These facts get reflected onto the black hole solution (6) as follows: as shown above, the black hole hair is a gauge artifact in the linearized theory, while this hair is not removable in the full nonlinear case.

It appears that the consistency with no-hair theorems prevents the existence of the black holes away from the special point since for λ  ≠  m2 the extra longitudinal mode, which would provide the hair, is a propagating field. At λ  =  m2 the black holes are possible only in the regime where the hair is carried by the longitudinal mode that is very (or perhaps infinitely) strongly coupled, at least when the dS horizon is approached. This feature is what seems to be responsible for the evasion of the no-hair theorems. It may be interesting to study similar questions in 3D ghost-free massive gravity [\cite=deRham:2010ik] [\cite=deRham:2010kj]. The latter theory differs from NMG by the absence in it of the massless 3D GR field. This field is responsible for negative mass, -  μ in ([\ref=bhmetric]).
