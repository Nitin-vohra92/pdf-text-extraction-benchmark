Density theorems for rational numbers

Introduction

In 1927, van der Waerden proved (in [\cite=vdW]) that for any finite partition of the set of natural numbers, there exists a cell of the partition which contains arbitrary long arithmetic progressions, which is a (perhaps the most) fundamental result of Ramsey theory. The density version of the van der Waerden theorem, that any set of positive upper density in [formula] possesses arbitrary long arithmetic progressions (the upper density of a subset [formula] is defined by [formula] where |A| denotes the cardinality of A) was conjectured by Erd[formula]s and Turán in 1930's and established by Szemerédi in 1975 ([\cite=Sz]).

Furstenberg, in 1977, reproved Szemerédi's theorem, introducing a correspondence principle, which provides the link between density Ramsey theory and ergodic theory ([\cite=Fu]) and proving a multiple recurrence theorem for measure preserving systems.

In this paper we will prove a multiple recurrence and two density results for the set of rational numbers giving sufficient conditions in order a set of rational numbers to contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. Using a representation of rational numbers (proved in [\cite=BIP]), according to which every rational number can be represented as a dominated located word over an infinite alphabet, we define the notion of a rational system (Definition [\ref=rmps]). We obtain:

(a) a multiple recurrence result concerning rational systems of measure preserving transformations in Theorem [\ref=thm:2], using the analogous result of Furstenberg-Katznelson for the IP-systems of measure preserving transformations,

(b) a sufficient condition via Følner sequences in order a subset of rational numbers to contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions in Theorem [\ref=thm:4], using a result of Hindman and Strauss for infinite countable left cancellative semigroups; and

(c) a density result viewing the rational numbers as located words in Theorem [\ref=l], which follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem of Furstenberg-Katznelson.

Let [formula] be the set of natural numbers, [formula] be the set of integer numbers, [formula] the set of rational numbers and [formula] [formula]

A multiple recurrence result for rational numbers

In this section, using the representation of rational numbers as dominated located words over an infinite alphabet, we define (in Definition [\ref=rmps]) the rational systems and we prove, in Theorem [\ref=thm:2] below, a recurrence result for such systems for measure preserving transformations using an analogous result for IP-systems of Furstenberg-Katznelson.

According to [\cite=BIP], every rational number q has a unique expression in the form

[formula]

where [formula] with   0  ≤  q- s  ≤  s for every s > 0, 0  ≤  qr  ≤  r for every r > 0 and q- s = qr = 0 for all but finite many r,s.

So, for a non-zero rational number q, there exist unique [formula] a non-empty finite subset of non-zero integers, the domain of q, [formula] and a subset of natural numbers [formula] with 1  ≤  qti  ≤   - ti if ti < 0 and 1  ≤  qti  ≤  ti if ti  >  0 for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, such that if dom-(q) = {t∈dom(q):  t < 0} and dom+(q) = {t∈dom(q):  t > 0} to have

[formula]

Consequently, q can be represented as the word

[formula]

It is easy to see that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

We will now recall the notion of IP-systems introduced by Furstenberg and Katznelson in [\cite=FuKa].

Let [formula] be a set of commuting transformations of a space. To every multi-index [formula] we attach the transformation

[formula]

The corresponding family {Tα}α∈[null]<  ω> 0 is an IP-system (of transformations).

Two IP-systems {T(1)α}α∈[null]<  ω> 0, {T(2)α}α∈[null]<  ω> 0 defined by [formula] and [formula] respectively, are commuting if T(1)nT(2)m = T(2)mT(1)n for every n, [formula]

Let [formula] be k commuting IP-systems defined by the measure preserving transformations [formula] 1  ≤  j  ≤  k of a measure space (X,B,μ) with μ(X) = 1 (i.e. T(j)n is B-measurable with μ(T(j) - 1n(A)) = μ(A) for every A∈B, 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, [formula]). If A∈B with μ(A) > 0, then there exists an index α with

[formula]

We will define the notion of a rational system (see also [\cite=K]), extending the notion of an IP-system.

Let [formula] be a set of commuting transformations of a set X. For a non-zero rational number q represented as the word [formula] we define

[formula] and T0(x) = x for every x∈X.

The corresponding family [formula] is a rational system (of transformations).

Two rational systems [formula] [formula] defined by [formula] and [formula] respectively, are commuting if Tn,1Tm,2 = Tm,2Tn,1 for every n, [formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=thm:1], we can take the following:

Let [formula] be k commuting rational systems defined by the measure preserving transformations [formula] 1  ≤  j  ≤  k respectively of a measure space (X,B,μ) with μ(X) = 1. If A∈B and μ(A) > 0 then there exists [formula] with

[formula]

Let A∈B with μ(A) > 0. For every [formula] choose a natural number qt with 1  ≤  qt  ≤  |t|. For every [formula] 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, set φ(i)2t - 1 = Tqtt,i, φ(i)2t = Tq- t- t,i and let the corresponding IP-systems {φ(i)α}α∈[null]<  ω> 0.

According to Theorem [\ref=thm:1] there exists [formula] with

[formula]

Since φ(i)α  =  Tqi for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, where

[formula]

we have that [formula]

With the same arguments as in Theorem [\ref=thm:2], we can prove that:

(1) There exists [formula] which satisfies the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:2], setting φ(i)t = Tqtt,i for every [formula] and 1  ≤  i  ≤  k.

(2) There exists [formula] which satisfies the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:2], setting φ(i)t = Tq- t- t,i for every [formula] and 1  ≤  i  ≤  k.

Density conditions for rational numbers

In this section, using Theorem [\ref=thm:2], we will give, via left Følner sequences, a sufficient condition (in Theorem [\ref=thm:4]) in order a subset of rational numbers to contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions, using a result of Hindman and Strauss (Theorem [\ref=thm:33]). Also, using Furstenberg-Katznelson's density Hales-Jewett theorem for words over a finite alphabet (Theorem [\ref=thm:6]), we prove in Theorem [\ref=l] a density result viewing the rational numbers as located words.

Firstly, we will define the left Følner sequences.

Let (S, + ) be a semigroup. A left Følner sequence in <  ω> 0 is a sequence [formula] in <  ω> 0 such that for each s∈S,

[formula]

where [formula]

If (S, + ) is an infinite countable left cancellative semigroup (i.e. a + b = a + c    ⇒    b = c for every a,b,c∈S), then we can find a left Følner sequence in <  ω> 0.

Given a left Følner sequence [formula] in <  ω> 0, there is a natural notion of upper density associated with F, namely

[formula]

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:4], which gives a sufficient condition in order a subset of rational numbers to contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions, we will need some notions from the theory of ultrafilters and also Theorem [\ref=thm:33], a fundamental result of Hindman and Strauss, which we mention below.

Ultrafilters

Let X be a non-empty set. An ultrafilter on the set X is a zero-one finite additive measure μ defined on all the subsets of X. The set of all ultrafilters on the set X is denoted by βX. So, μ∈βX if and only if

μ(A)∈{0,1} for every A  ⊆  X, μ(X) = 1, and

[formula] for every A,B  ⊆  X with [formula].

For μ∈βX, it is easy to see that [formula] if μ(A) = 1 and μ(B) = 1. For every x∈X is defined the principal ultrafilter μx on X which corresponds a set A  ⊆  X to μx(A) = 1 if x∈A and μx(A) = 0 if x∉A. So, μ is a non-principal ultrafilter on X if and only if μ(A) = 0 for every finite subset A of X.

The set βX becomes a compact Hausdorff space if it be endowed with the topology [formula] which has basis the family [formula], where [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula], [formula] and [formula] for every A,B  ⊆  X. We always consider the set βX endowed with the topology [formula] Also βX is called the Stone-[formula]ech compactification of the set X.

If (X, + ) is a semigroup, then a binary operation +   is defined on βX, extending the operation +   on X, corresponding to every μ1,μ2∈βX the ultrafilter μ1  +  μ2∈βX, with

(μ1  +  μ2)(A) = μ1({x∈X:μ2({y∈X:x + y∈A}) = 1}) for every A  ⊆  X.

With this operation [formula] becomes a right topological semigroup, that is, for every μ∈βX the function fx0:βX  →  βX with fx0(μ) = μx0  +  μ is continuous.

Hindman and Strauss in [\cite=HS] proved the following result concerning left cancellative semigroups. For A  ⊆  S and t∈S we set - t + A = {s∈S:  t + s∈A}.

Let S be an infinite countable left cancellative semigroup, let [formula] be a left Følner sequence in <  ω> 0, and let A  ⊆  S. There is a countably additive measure μ on the set B of Borel subsets of βS such that

(1) [formula]

(2) for all B  ⊆  S, [formula]

(3) for all B∈B and all t∈S, μ( - t + B) = μ(B) = μ(t + B), and

(4) μ(βS) = 1.

Now we can state our theorem and give a proof in analogy to Theorem 5.6 in [\cite=HS].

Let [formula] be a left Følner sequence in <  ω> 0, and let [formula] such that [formula] Then for each [formula] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Let B be the set of Borel subsets of [formula] Pick a countably additive measure μ on B which satisfies the conditions of Theorem [\ref=thm:33]. Let [formula] For [formula] and [formula] let Tl,m(ν) = μl( - 1)m + 1m!  +  ν for [formula] and [formula] for [formula] Each Tl,n, [formula] is a continuous function from [formula] to [formula] since [formula] is a right topological semigroup. Let [formula] be the rational system defined from [formula] for every 1  ≤  l  ≤  k respectively.

The transformations Tl,n, [formula] preserve μ, since μ satisfies the condition (3) of Theorem [\ref=thm:33]. Consequently, [formula] 1  ≤  l  ≤  k are commuting rational systems of measure preserving transformations on the space [formula] According to the condition (1) of Theorem [\ref=thm:33], we have [formula] So, using Theorem [\ref=thm:2], we can find [formula] such that

[formula]

This gives

[formula] [formula]

which finishes the proof.

Let [formula] be a left Følner sequence in <  ω> 0, and let [formula] such that [formula] Then for each [formula] there exist [formula] and p∈A such that

p + jq∈A for every 0  ≤  j  ≤  k.

Let [formula] According to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:4] there exists [formula] such that [formula] Pick [formula]

(1) In the statements of Theorem [\ref=thm:4] and Corollary [\ref=c] the rational number q can be located either in [formula] or in [formula] using in the respective proof the results of Remark [\ref=r].

(2) Defining for a left Følner sequence [formula] in <  ω> 0, and [formula] the density

[formula]

we can replace [formula] with [formula] in the statements of Theorem [\ref=thm:4] and Corollary [\ref=c], using Theorem 4.6 in [\cite=HS], instead of Theorem [\ref=thm:33].

Viewing the rational numbers as words and using the density Hales-Jewett theorem of Furstenberg and Katznelson ([\cite=FuKa]), we will prove in Theorem [\ref=l] another density result for the set of rational numbers. Let start with the necessary notation.

Let [formula] for [formula] a finite set and υ∉Σ. We denote by W(Σ) the set of all the words [formula] where [formula] and w(i)∈Σ for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and by W(Σ,υ) the set of all the (variable) words in [formula] with at least one occurrence of the symbol υ. A combinatorial line in W(Σ) is a set {w(α):  α∈Σ} obtained by substituting the variable υ of the variable word w(υ) by the symbols [formula] We also denote by Wn(Σ) the subset of W(Σ) consisting of all the words of length n.

Furstenberg and Katznelson in [\cite=FuKa2] proved the following theorem:

Let [formula] a finite alphabet. If A  ⊆  W(Σ) and [formula] then A contains a combinatorial line.

For every [formula] and integers [formula] with |tnj|  ≥  k for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  n we define, in analogy to the representation of rational numbers, the subset [formula] as

[formula] 1  ≤  qtnj  ≤  k, [formula] if tnj < 0            and ctnj = ( - 1)tnj + 1tnj! if tnj > 0}.

For [formula] we define

[formula] with [formula]

Note that [formula] is 1 - 1 and onto for every [formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=thm:6] we have the following density theorem:

Let [formula] and a sequence [formula] with [formula] and |tnj|  ≥  k for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, [formula] If [formula] with [formula] then there exist p∈A and [formula] with dom(p), [formula] for some [formula] such that

p + iq∈A for every [formula]

Let [formula] Since [formula] for every [formula] the set g- 1(A) contains a combinatorial line {w(α):  α∈Σ} obtained by a variable word w(υ), υ∉Σ, according to Theorem [\ref=thm:6]. Let n be the length of w(υ). Then, [formula] So, there exist F1  =  {t∈dom(w):wt∈Σ}, F2  =  {t∈dom(w):wt  =  υ} with [formula] and [formula] such that if [formula] and [formula] where [formula] if t < 0 and ct = ( - 1)t + 1t! if t > 0, we have that g(w(i)) = p + iq∈A for every 0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1.
