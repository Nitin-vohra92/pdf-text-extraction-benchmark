A tree-free group that is not orderable

Let Λ be an ordered abelian group. A group is Λ-free if it admits a free isometric action without inversions on a Λ-tree, and tree-free if it is Λ'-free for some Λ'. We refer to the book [\cite=Chiswell-book] for a detailed account of the fundamentals of Λ-trees.

In this book Chiswell asks [\cite=Chiswell-book] whether all tree-free groups are orderable, or at least right-orderable. There has recently been some progress made on questions of orderability in tree-free groups. Chiswell himself has shown [\cite=Chiswell-ro] that [formula]-free groups are right-orderable. Kharlampovich, Myasnikov and Serbin have shown [\cite=KM-Lambda] that finitely presented tree-free groups are [formula]-free for some n; thus these groups are right-orderable. Chiswell has shown moreover [\cite=Chiswell-LIO] that tree-free groups admit a locally invariant order.

In their recent survey Kharlampovich, Myasnikov and Serbin state [\cite=KMS-long-survey] that finitely presented tree-free groups have a finite index subgroup that embeds in a right-angled Artin group: this is a consequence of their result [\cite=KM-Lambda] and the extensive work of Wise (see [\cite=Wise-hierarchy] and [\cite=Wise-shorter-hierarchy]) on quasi-convex hierarchies on groups. Since right-angled Artin groups are residually torsion-free nilpotent (see [\cite=Droms-thesis]), it follows that finitely presented tree-free groups are virtually residually torsion-free nilpotent; hence they are virtually orderable.

The author has recently [\cite=affine-paper] raised the question of whether [formula]-free groups are residually torsion-free nilpotent. An affirmative answer to this question would have implied that [formula]-free groups are orderable.

Nevertheless the answer to Chiswell's question is negative, even when restricted to finitely presented [formula]-free groups, as will show presently. It follows that the word 'virtually' cannot be dropped in the discussion above. This suggests an analogy with the situation of braid groups Bn and their finite index subgroups, the pure braid groups Pn: the former are right-orderable but not orderable (see [\cite=Rolfsen-braid-survey]), while the latter are residually torsion-free nilpotent [\cite=Falk-Randell].

Recall that a group G is orderable if there is a linear order ≤   on G satisfying x  ≤  y  ⇒  gxh  ≤  gyh for g,h∈G. (One can define right-orderable by restricting to g = 1 in the definition above.) It is well-known and easy to see that in an orderable group G there can be no non-trivial generalised torsion elements: these are elements g such that [formula] for some [formula] and n  ≥  1. (Here gh denotes the conjugate h- 1gh.)

Let F be the free group on {x,y,z}, and consider the natural free action of F on the corresponding Cayley graph, viewed as a [formula]-tree. Observe that xy- 1, yz- 1 and zx- 1 and their respective inverses belong to distinct conjugacy classes since they are cyclically reduced as elements of F and none is a cyclic permutation of another. Moreover, the translation lengths of these elements are all equal to 2.

Now taking s1 = xy- 1 = s2, t1 = yz- 1, t2 = zx- 1, u = u1 and v = u2, and applying [\cite=Bass], the multiple HNN extension

[formula]

is seen to be [formula]-free. However,

[formula]

whence xy- 1 is a non-trivial generalised torsion element of Γ, and Γ is not orderable. This gives the promised negative answer to Chiswell's question.
