High-precision camera distortion measurements with a "calibration harp"

Note to referees and editor: Our lens distortion measurement algorithm can be tested on the online demo version available at .

Introduction

The precision of 3D stereovision applications is intimately related to the precision of the camera calibration, and especially of the camera distortion correction. An imprecise distortion model produces residual distortion that will be directly back-projected to the reconstructed 3D scene. Such imprecision can be a serious hindrance in remote sensing applications such as the early warnings of geology disasters, or in the construction of topographic maps from stereographic pairs of aerial photographs. The fast growing resolution of digital cameras and of their optical quality is transforming them into (potential) high precision measurement tools. Thus, it becomes important to measure the calibration precision with ever higher precision.

A first step toward high-precision distortion corrections is to perform precise distortion measurements. This basic tool can then be used to evaluate the precision of a correction method, or can become part of the correction method itself.

Camera and lens distortion measurement methods usually require a flat pattern containing aligned elements. The pattern is photographed using the target lens, and the distortion is measured by how much the observed elements deviate from the straight alignment on the pattern. For example the classic DxO-labs' software, a good representative of camera maker practice, () uses a pattern with a grid of aligned dots. Distortion is measured by the positional errors associated with the maximal deviation in a row, see Fig. [\ref=fig:dxo_distortion]. Similar methods are proposed by the SMIA, EBU, IE, and I3A standards. These measurements are generally manual and require a perfectly flat pattern.

Every lens distortion correction method includes, implicitly, a lens distortion measurement. These methods can be roughly classified into four groups:

re-projection error minimization methods;

pattern matching methods;

enlarged epipolar geometry based methods;

plumb-line methods.

Re-projection methods usually rely on a planar pattern containing simple geometric shapes. In these methods, the lens distortion is estimated together with the camera internal and external parameters [\cite=Slama1980] [\cite=Tsai1987] [\cite=Zhang2000] [\cite=Lavest1998] [\cite=Weng1992], by minimizing the re-projection error between the observed control points on the pattern and the re-projected control points simulated by the pattern model and camera model. The distortion is measured in terms of re-projection error once all the parameters have been estimated. Both the internal parameter errors and the external parameter errors contribute to the re-projection error. Unfortunately, these errors can compensate each other. Thus, a small re-projection error may be observed while the internal and external parameters are not well estimated. This compensation effect reduces the precision of the estimation of the lens distortion parameters [\cite=TheseZhongwei]. It hinders accurate distortion estimation from the re-projection error. Notice that this high precision is not always required. In some applications, the distortion estimated in these bundle adjustment based re-projection methods, which makes the 3D geometry consistent with the pin-hole model, is precise enough for human observer.

A quite different kind of method proceeds by matching a photograph of a flat pattern to its digital model. These methods estimate the distortion field by interpolating a continuous distortion field from a set of matching points. Several variants exist depending on the kind of pattern, matching and interpolation technique. A common and crucial assumption for these methods is that the pattern is flat. In practice, however, it is difficult to produce a very flat pattern, and the consequences of a tiny flatness flaw are considerable. For example it is reported in [\cite=Grompone2010] that a flatness error of about 100 μm for a 40 centimeters broad pattern can lead to an error of about 0.3 pixels in the distortion field computation for a Canon EOS 30D camera of focal length 18 mm with the distance between the camera and the object about 30 cm. The only physical method to assess a pattern flatness at a high precision is interferometry, but it requires the pattern to be a mirror, which is not adequate for photography. Furthermore, camera calibration requires large patterns, which are therefore flexible. Deformations of the order of 100 μm or more can be caused by temperature changes, and by a mere position change of the pattern, which deforms under its own weight.

Recently, more attention has been paid to pattern-free methods (or self-calibration methods) where the distortion estimation is obtained without using any specific pattern. The distortion is estimated from the correspondences between two or several images in absence of any camera information. The main tool is the so-called enlarged epipolar constraint, which incorporates lens distortion into the epipolar geometry. Some iterative [\cite=Stein1997] [\cite=Zhang1996] or non-iterative methods [\cite=Fitzgibbon2001] [\cite=Micusik2003] [\cite=Li2005] [\cite=Thirthala2005] [\cite=Claus2005a] [\cite=Barreto2005] [\cite=Kukelova2007] [\cite=Kukelova2008] [\cite=Byrod2008] [\cite=Kukelova2007a] [\cite=Josephson2009] are used to estimate the distortion and correct it by minimizing an algebraic error. The estimated distortion can be used as the initialization in bundle adjustment methods to improve the camera calibration precision [\cite=Triggs2000].

The so called "plumb-line" methods, which correct the distortion by rectifying distorted images of 3D straight lines, date back to the 1970s (see Brown's seminal paper in 1971 [\cite=Brown1971]). Since then, this idea has been applied to many distortion models: the radial model [\cite=Alvarez2009] [\cite=PRESCOTT1997] [\cite=Pajdla1997], the FOV (Field Of View) model [\cite=Devernay2001], or the rational function model [\cite=Claus2005]. These methods minimize the straightness error of the corrected lines. According to the fundamental theorem to be introduced in section [\ref=sec:theorem], the plumb-line methods minimize an error directly related to the distortion, without suffering from the above mentioned drawback, namely a numerical error compensation. On the other hand, in spite of their name, current digital plumb-line methods usually involve flat patterns with alignments on them and not the plumb lines that were originally proposed in analog photogrammetry.

Taken literally, these methods should use photographs of 3D straight lines. When a high precision is required, this setup becomes much easier to build than a flat pattern. The main purpose of this article is to show that very accurate distortion evaluation and correction can be obtained with a basic plumb line tool which we called "calibration harp". The calibration harp is nothing but a frame supporting tightly stretched strings. Nevertheless, the photographs of a calibration harp require a new numerical treatment to exploit them. The strings will have to be detected at high sub-pixel accuracy and their distortion converted into an invariant measurement.

Distortion measurements can be used to evaluate the distortion of a camera, but also its residual distortion after correction. Two aspects of the measurement should be clarified here. In this paper we discuss distortion measurements that apply to the camera conceived as a whole: It is impossible to tell which part the relative position and deformation of the CCD, and the lens distortion itself play in the global camera distortion. The distortion measurement is therefore not a pure optical lens distortion measurement, but the distortion measurement of the full acquisition system of camera+lens in a given state. Different lenses on different cameras can be compared only when the camera calibration matrix is known. On the other hand, the residual error due to different correction algorithms can be compared objectively after applying an appropriate normalization on the corrected images.

This paper is organized as follows: The fundamental theorem characterizing undistorted cameras is introduced in section [\ref=sec:theorem]. Section [\ref=sec:harp_building] uncovers the simple fabrication secrets of calibration harps. The image processing algorithms needed for an automatic measurement are presented in section [\ref=sec:edge_detection] and section [\ref=sec:measurements] introduces the two most relevant measures. Section [\ref=sec:applications] demonstrates two applications, to the measurement of residual distortion after applying a calibration method, and to the transformation of existing manual distortion correction methods into automatic and far more precise ones. Finally, section [\ref=sec:conclusion] concludes the paper.

From Straight Lines to Straight Lines

In multiple-view geometry, the pinhole camera is the ideal model that all techniques tend to approximate at best by calibrating the real cameras. This model corresponds to the ideal geometric perspective projection. The next theorem characterizes perspective projections by the fact that they preserve alignments. Instead of restating the simplified version in [\cite=Hartley2004], we prefer to make it more precise. The proof of the theorem can be found in [\cite=TheseZhongwei].

Let [formula] be a continuous map from P3 to P2 (from 3D projective space to 2D projective plane). If there is a point [formula] such that:

the images of any three point belonging to a line in P3 not containing [formula], are aligned points in P2;

the images of any two points belonging to a line in P3 containing [formula], are the same point in P2;

there are at least four points belonging to a plane not containing [formula], such that any group of three of them are non aligned, and their images are non aligned either;

then [formula] is a pinhole camera with center [formula].

This theorem provides us with a fundamental tool to verify that a camera follows the pinhole model. Nevertheless, rectifying straight lines does not define a unique distortion correction: two corrections can differ by any 2D homography that preserves all alignments. More concretely, assume that the real camera model is [formula] with [formula] the coordinate of camera optic center in a given 3D world frame, [formula] the camera 3  ×  3 orientation matrix, [formula] the camera 3  ×  3 calibration matrix and D the camera lens non-linear distortion. The estimated distortion can be written as [formula] with [formula] the unknown homography introduced in the distortion correction and can be different from one correction algorithm to another. By applying the inverse of the estimated distortion, the recovered pinhole camera is [formula]. The homography [formula] can enlarge or reduce the straightness error, which makes the comparison of different correction algorithms unfair. This effect can be compensated by two strategies.

To arrive at a universal measurement, a first strategy that we will consider is to normalize the homography:

Select four points [formula] in the distorted image in general position (not three of them aligned). For example, they can be the four corners of the distorted image.

Find their corresponding points [formula] in the corrected image, according to the correction model: [formula]. Note that [formula] is different from one correction algorithm to another.

Compute the normalization homography [formula] which maps [formula] to [formula]: [formula]. Note that [formula] is different from one correction algorithm to another.

Apply the normalization homography [formula] on the corrected image.

With this normalization, the final correction model is [formula].

A second possible strategy would be to fix specific parameters in the correction model. For example, since the zoom factor in the distortion correction is mainly determined by the order-1 parameters in the correction model, it is sufficient to set all the order-1 parameters to be 1 to obtain a unique distortion measurement. Unfortunately, this will not be possible for some non-parametric distortion correction methods. The first strategy therefore is more general.

Building a Calibration Harp

Theorem [\ref=theo:fundamental_prop] suggests to take a set of physical straight lines, as a calibration pattern. However, a common practice actually contradicts the plumb-line basic idea: line patterns are printed and pasted over a flat plate. There are many sources of imprecision in this setup: the printer quality is not perfect; the paper thickness is not perfectly uniform; the pasting process can add bubbles or a non uniform glue layer; the supporting surface is not perfectly flat either. Notwithstanding these defects, if only a pixel precision is required, this setup is quite sufficient. Nonetheless, when high sub-pixel precision is involved, the flatness errors cannot be neglected. For current camera precision, a flatness error of 100 μm (the thickness of current writing paper) for a 40 cm pattern can lead to errors in the observed image coordinates of about 0.3 pixels [\cite=Grompone2010]. High precision aims at final 3D reconstructions far more precise than this. So the measuring tool error should be also far smaller, if only possible.

The obvious advantage of "real" plumb lines on 2D patterns with straight lines on them, is that it is much easier to ensure a very precise physical straightness for lines than a very precise physical flatness for a physical pattern plate. Yet, the precision of the resulting measurement or correction depends on the straightness of the physical lines. In [\cite=Brown1971], to achieve a high precision, plumb lines were made of very fine white thread and stabilized by immersion of the plumb bobs in oil containers. Illumination was provided by a pair of vertically mounted fluorescent fixtures. A dead black background was provided for the plumb-line array to highlight the contrast. The points on the lines were measured with a microscope. The measuring process required from 5 to 6 hours for generating 324 points. The digital procedure proposed here will be automatic and faster.

For the applications where the precision is not a crucial point, straight lines present in the natural scene can be used. In [\cite=Claus2005] [\cite=Rosten2011], the straight lines are obtained by photographing the architectural scenes and points on the lines are detected by Canny edge detector.

In order to keep the high precision and simplify the fabrication procedure, we built a simple calibration pattern by tightly stretching strings on a frame as shown Fig. [\ref=fig:harp1]. The pattern looks like the musical instrument, hence its name. The setup warrants the physical straightness of the lines. Its construction does not require any experimental skill, but only good quality strings. Indeed twisted strings show local width oscillations; other strings do not have a round section, and a little torsion also results in width variations that can have a large spatial period. Rigid strings may have a remanent curvature. Finally, a (tiny) gravity effect can be avoided by using well stretched vertical lines.

In our experiments three different strings were tested: a sewing string, a smooth tennis racket string, and an opaque fishing string, all shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:three_types_lines1]. Sewing strings have a braid pattern and their thickness oscillates. Tennis racket strings are rigid and require a very strong tension to become straight. Fishing strings are both smooth and flexible, and can therefore be easily tightened and become very straight. The transparent ones, however, behave like a cylindrical lens, producing multiple complex edges. Opaque fishing strings end up being the best choice to build a calibration harp. Fig. [\ref=fig:string_high_freq1] shows an evaluation of the obtained straightness. We took photos of the three types of strings, and corrected their distortion. The green curves show the signed distance from edge points of a corrected line to its regression line. The red curve shows the high frequency component of the corresponding distorted line. The high frequency is computed as follows:

Transform the edge points extracted from the distorted line into the intrinsic coordinate system, which is determined by the direction of the regression line computed from these points. In this coordinate system, the x-coordinate is the distance between the edge points and a reference edge point along the regression line and the y-coordinate is the signed distance from the edge points to the regression line. This produces a one-dimensional signal (see Fig. [\ref=fig:intrinsic_coord]).

Apply a big Gaussian convolution of standard deviation σ  =  40 pixels on this one-dimensional signal to keep only the low frequency component.

The difference between this convolved signal and the original signal in the intrinsic coordinate system is considered as the high frequency. The red curves in Fig. [\ref=fig:string_high_freq1] show the high frequency (due to the border effect of Gaussian convolution, there is a sharp increase of magnitude at the border).

To ensure the precision of the edge detection in the string images, a uniform background whose color contrasts well with the string color must be preferred. Using an opaque background is not a good idea because this requires a direct lighting and the strings project shadows on the background (Fig. [\ref=fig:harp_opaque_bg1] and [\ref=fig:closeup_harp_opaque_bg1]). The sky itself is hardly usable: a large open space is needed to avoid buildings and trees entering the camera field of view, and clouds render it inhomogeneous, see Fig. [\ref=fig:background1]. The simplest solution is to place a translucent homogeneous paper or plastic sheet behind the harp and to use back illumination, preferably natural light to make it more uniform (see Fig. [\ref=fig:harp_translucent_bg1] and [\ref=fig:closeup_harp_translucent_bg1]).

The acquisition aspects are also important for producing high quality measurements: lens blur, motion blur, aliasing, noise, must be as reduced as physically possible. To that aim a tripod and timer were used to reduce camera motions, but also to avoid out of focus strings while taking photos at different orientations. Of course, changing focus changes the distortion. Thus each distortion calibration must be done for a fixed focus, and is associated with this focus.

Straight Edges Extraction

In this section we describe the procedure to extract accurately and smooth the aligned edge points, which will be used to measure the distortion.

Devernay's algorithm [\cite=Devernay1995] is the classic sub-pixel accurate edge detector. The implementation of Devernay's detector is very simple since it is derived from the well-known Non-Maxima Suppression method [\cite=Canny1986] [\cite=Deriche1987]. On good quality images (SNR larger than 100), Devernay's detector can attain a precision of about 0.05 pixels.

Straightness measurements require the detection of groups of edge points that belong to the same physical straight line, and the rejection of points that do not belong to any line. To this aim, line segments are detected on the image using the LSD algorithm [\cite=Grompone2010lsd] [\cite=IPOLLSDpaper]. When applied to photographs of the calibration harp, the detection essentially corresponds to the strings. In case of a strong distortion, one string edge could be cut into several line segments.

LSD works by grouping connected pixels into line support regions, see Fig. [\ref=fig:line-support-regions]; for more details we refer to [\cite=Grompone2010lsd] [\cite=IPOLLSDpaper]. These regions are then approximated by a rectangle and validated. The line support region links a line segment to its support pixels. Thus, Devernay's edge points that belong to the same line support region can be grouped as aligned; points belonging to none are ignored.

For photos of strings, almost every pixel along each side of one string is detected as an edge point at sub-pixel precision. So there are about 1000 edge points detected for a line of length of about 1000 pixels. This large number of edge points opens the possibility to further reduce the detection and aliasing noise left by sub-sampling the edge points.

The sub-sampling step must be done carefully. First the edge points are re-sampled to warrant a uniform sampling step along the edge; this will facilitate the following steps. The re-sampling uses a step of d  =  L / N where L is the length of a line and N is the number of extracted edge points on the line. The interpolation of an edge point (x',y') between two adjacent edge points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is expressed by

[formula]

where a and b are the distances between the points, see Fig. [\ref=fig:resampling]. Then, a Gaussian blur with [formula] is needed before a sub-sampling of factor t to avoid aliasing [\cite=Morel2011sift]. We have two one-dimensional signals (x-coordinate and y-coordinate of edge points) along the length of the line. The Gaussian convolution is performed on both one-dimension signals, parameterized by the length along the edge. Finally, the sub-sampling of integer factor t keeps one edge point out of t.

Distortion Measurements

This section examines two natural distortion measurements that are somewhat complementary.

Root-Mean-Square Distance

According to Theorem [\ref=theo:fundamental_prop], the most direct measure should be the straightness error, defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) distance from a set of distorted edge points that correspond to the same physical line, to their global linear regression line, see Fig. [\ref=fig:straightness].

Given N edge points [formula] of a distorted line, the regression line

[formula]

is computed by where Since (α,β) is a unit vector, the signed distance from point (xi,yi) to the line is given by

[formula]

Given L lines, with Nl points in line l, the total sum of squared signed distance is given by

[formula]

Thus, the RMS straightness error is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] is the total number of points.

Maximal error

An alternative measure is the average maximal error defined by

[formula]

In the classic camera maker practice, the maximal error is defined by

[formula]

which would become instable with the calibration harp, some of the strings being potentially distorted by blur or wrong detection.

This measure is traditionally used in manual settings, for example see Fig. [\ref=fig:dxo_distortion]. While traditionally the measures are made relatively to the line joining the extremities of the distorted edge, see Fig. [\ref=fig:arc], here we use the signed distance to the regression line to make it more comparable to the previous measure. The use of a signed distance and the difference between the maximal and minimal value is needed to handle correctly the fact that there are values on both sides of the regression line, see Fig. [\ref=fig:arc].

Applications

In this section, real photographs of the calibration harp will be used to evaluate the residual camera distortion when this distortion has been corrected with three state-of-the-art correction methods or two popular software. In addition, we can feed any plumb-line method with the precise edge points detected on the harp images to improve the correction precision. The efficient Alvarez et al. algorithm thus becomes an automatic parametric distortion correction method. Our lens distortion measurement algorithm can be tested on the online demo version available at .

Precision

It is reported in [\cite=Devernay1995] that Devernay edge points have a precision better than 0.05 pixel under zero-noise condition. As proposed in Section [\ref=sec:edge_detection], the precision of Devernay edge points can be further improved by applying Gaussian convolution of standard deviation [formula], followed by a sub-sampling of factor t. The only parameter to adjust here is the factor t, which corresponds to the assumed regularity of the lens distortion. We are only interested in realistic lens distortion, which makes a straight line globally convex or concave. Thus local edge oscillations due to noise can be harmlessly removed. In the experiments, the value of t  =  30 was chosen, which is enough to remove the local oscillation while keeping the global distortion.

Measuring the residual error after distortion

As a first main application, the "calibration harp" permits to evaluate the performance of any distortion correction algorithm by measuring its residual distortion in corrected images. The procedure is as follows:

A series of photos of the "calibration harp" are taken at different orientations.

These photos are processed by a camera distortion correction algorithm.

The corrected images are normalized by a homography as described in section [\ref=sec:theorem].

The residual distortion is measured by the proposed method.

Three distortion correction algorithms and two software were tested. With the exception of the classic Lavest et al. calibration method, all the others are designed to only correct the lens distortion without estimating the other camera parameters:

The Lavest et al. method [\cite=Lavest1998]: probably the most advanced pattern-based global camera calibration method, which estimates and corrects for the pattern non-flatness, using a bundle adjustment technique. Various distortion parameter configurations are allowed in this method: 2 radial parameters and 2 tangential parameters for a partial distortion model; 2 radial parameters for a partial radial distortion model; 5 radial parameters for a complete radial distortion model; 5 radial parameters and 2 tangential parameters for a full distortion model.

A non-parametric lens distortion correction method requiring a textured flat pattern [\cite=Grompone2010]. The pattern is obtained by printing a textured image and pasting it on an aluminum plate, which is thick and solid.

The DxO-Optics-Pro software: a program for professional photographers automatically correcting lens distortion (even from fisheyes), color fringing and vignetting, noise and blur. This software reads the EXIF of each image to know exactly what camera, lens and settings have been used. It therefore uses a fixed lens distortion estimation for each supported camera model.

PTLens: Photoshop plug-in that corrects lens pincushion/barrel distortion, vignetting and chromatic aberration.

The distorted photographs to be corrected are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:distorted_calib_harp_photos] and Table [\ref=tab:mesurements_on_different_algo] shows the residual distortion measurements obtained by the calibration harp, after applying the corrections specified by the various methods.

The Lavest et al. method depends on the parameter configuration of the distortion model integrated in the global calibration process. Since the global calibration process only minimizes the re-projection error and does not control the distortion correction, it can happen that the error in internal parameters compensates the error in external parameters. In consequence, the minimized re-projection error is small, but neither the estimated distortion parameters nor the other parameters are correct. In fact this is the common drawback of global camera calibration methods based on bundle adjustment. The textured pattern based method requires a perfectly flat pattern. Even though it is not very feasible to fabricate a perfectly flat pattern, a pattern made of a thick and solid aluminium plate gives a good flatness condition and thus a precise distortion correction. DxO Optics Pro includes many pre-calibrated distortion models depending on the camera type and parameters setting. But these distortion models are only calibrated on several fixed focused distances and obtain by interpolation the distortion models focused on the other distances. Once the camera parameters are extracted from the EXIF of each image, DxO Optics Pro asks the user to manually input the focused distance before performing the correction. This makes the distortion correction result less precise; considering this, the results are surprisingly good. PTLens works in the similar manner as DxO Optics Pro except that it does not ask users to provide the focused distance information. It is not clear how PTLens recovers this information which is not available in EXIF. Probably PTLens applies a fixed correction for each focal length, independently of the focus. This coarse approximation may explain why its correction precision is not as good as DxO Optics Pro.

We also note that [formula] is always larger than d. This is not surprising, since [formula] is the largest displacement with respect to the linear regression line of the edge points.

Strengthening Plumb-Line Distortion Correction Methods

Any plumb-line distortion correction method requires as input the edge points on distorted lines, which are themselves projections of 3D straight lines. The distortion can then be corrected by aligning the edge points belonging to the same line. To see this, let us introduce the widely used radial distortion correction model:

[formula]

with (xu,yu) the corrected point, (xd,yd) the distorted point, (xc,yc) the distortion center and [formula] the distorted radius. Usually f(rd) is a polynomial of rd and can be written as:

[formula]

with k0, k1, k2, [formula], kN the distortion parameters. Assume we have L lines and there are Nl points on line l, [formula]. A natural way to correct the distortion is to minimize the sum of squared distances from the corrected points to the corresponding regression line:

[formula]

with the linear regression line l:αlx  +  βly  +  γl  =  0 computed from the corrected points [formula]. The only unknown parameters in D are [formula] and (xc,yc). With an appropriate initialization of these parameters, D can be efficiently minimized by non-linear optimization algorithms, like Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

Instead of minimizing D, Alvarez et al. [\cite=Alvarez2009] proposed to minimize the measurement:

[formula]

where Sl is the covariance matrix for the corrected points on the line l:

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. It can be proven [\cite=Alvarez2009] that this new energy function E is always positive and equals to 0 if and only if for each line its points are aligned. The functional E can be further written in the form of matrix-vector multiplication [\cite=Alvarez2009]:

[formula]

with [formula] the distortion parameters in the form of vector and

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The trivial solution [formula] can be avoided by setting k0  =  1.

In general, minimizing [formula] is equivalent to solve a set of equations:

[formula]

When there is only one unknown parameter, the solution can be approximated by solving the root of the resulting univariate polynomial. When there are two unknown parameters, resultant-based method can be used to minimize [formula]. The case of more than two variables requires Gröbner basis techniques or multivariate-resultants based method (see [\cite=Alvarez2009] for more detail). To make the algorithm efficient, [\cite=Alvarez2009] optimizes on two parameters at one time and iterates:

Obtain distorted edge points which are the 2D projection of 3D straight segments;

Initialize [formula];

Choose any pair (p,q),1  ≤  p,q  ≤  N and fix all the other parameters, then optimize kp and kq by resultant-based method;

Update k0 using a zoom factor such that distorted and undistorted points are as close as possible;

Repeat Step 3 and 4 until all the parameters are estimated.

It is usually supposed that the edge points are already available for the plumb-line methods. But in practice, it is not a trivial problem to precisely extract aligned edge points in images. For example, the online demo [\cite=AlvarezIPOL] of Alvarez et al. method [\cite=Alvarez2009] requires the user to click manually edge points. This is on the one hand a tedious and time consuming work, and on the other hand, it may reduce the precision of edge points. Our method thus gives the possibility to automatize plumb-line methods. We fed four kinds of edge points to the Alvarez et al. method: first the manually clicked edge points of a natural image (Fig. [\ref=subfig:natural_img]), second the manually clicked edge points of an image of the grid pattern (Fig. [\ref=subfig:grid_img]), third the manually clicked edge points of an image of the calibration harp (Fig. [\ref=subfig:harp_img]) and finally the automatically extracted edge points of an image of the calibration harp (Fig. [\ref=subfig:harp_img]), as described in section [\ref=sec:edge_detection]. These points were used as the input to the Alvarez et al. method to estimate an order-4 radial distortion model, which will be used to correct the distorted images in Fig. [\ref=fig:distorted_calib_harp_photos]. The precision of this correction was finally evaluated by the method proposed in the paper (applied to a different set of images of the calibration harp from the one used to estimate the correction).

The results in Table [\ref=tab:manual_alvarez_vs_automatic_alvarez] show that the edge point extraction by our proposed method strengthens the plumb-line method in terms of precision and spares the long, tedious and imprecise manual point clicking task. Compared to the manual clicks with the calibration harp, the improvement in precision is moderate. Indeed, the Alvarez et al. method is applied on a very good quality photograph of the harp. The manual clicks were carefully placed on the lines across the domain of the image. The slight inaccuracy of the clicks was smoothed out by our method which applies a Gaussian convolution of the edge points along the edges, see section [\ref=sec:edge_detection]. The manual clicks on the image of the grid pattern and on the natural image give a precision that is two or three times lower than the calibration harp. For the grid pattern, the imprecision may come from the non-flatness error, the engraved straight lines on the pattern being not really straight. For the natural image, the imprecision comes from two aspects: one is again the non-straightness error of the lines, the other is the lack of lines at the border of the image domain, which can explain a precision decay near the image border.

Conclusion

A "calibration harp" has been proposed for camera distortion measurement, along with its associated image processing chain. This harp is both a measurement tool and a correction tool. As a measurement tool, it can be used independently to measure the residual distortion left by any distortion correction methods or any software. As a correction tool, the precise edge points detected on the harp can be used as the input to plumb-line methods and lead to more precise distortion correction result. In the future, we aim at finding a more general distortion model to correct more severe distortion by using the calibration harp. The ideal case would be a harp-free distortion correction method. But we think that the harp will always remain useful, as a final measurement tool to validate any other correction precision and or to detect its failures.
