The Tate-Hochschild Cohomology Ring of a Group Algebra

Introduction

The theory of group cohomology is a well-studied yet ongoing research area. It has many applications to other areas such as representation theory, algebraic geometry, and commutative algebra. It is well-known that the Hochschild cohomology of a group algebra agrees with its usual cohomology, in the following sense. For an arbitrary commutative ring R and a group G, if M is an RG-bimodule, then it may be regarded as a left RG-module via the diagonal action g  ·  m  =  gmg- 1, where g∈G,m∈M. Conversely, any left RG-module M may be considered as an RG-bimodule by letting RG act trivially on the right. Together with the Eckmann-Shapiro Lemma, this shows that the Hochschild cohomology ring, [formula] with coefficients in an RG-bimodule M, is the same as the usual group cohomology ring, [formula] with coefficients in M under the diagonal action. In particular, by considering RG as its own bimodule, [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], where RG is a left RG-module via conjugation. From this identification and the Eckmann-Shapiro Lemma, one can prove that [formula] may be decomposed as a direct sum of the cohomology of the centralizers of conjugacy class representatives of G ([\cite=Ben2], Theorem 2.11.2). In 1999, Siegel and Witherspoon then described a formula for the products in [formula] in terms of this additive decomposition [\cite=SW]. When G is abelian, Cibils and Solotar proved that the Hochschild cohomology ring of G is (isomorphic to) the tensor product over R of RG and its usual cohomology ring [\cite=CiSo].

In 1952, John Tate introduced a group cohomology theory that is based on complete resolutions, and hence, expands the study of group cohomology to negative degrees [\cite=Tate]. Tate cohomology exploits the similarities between the usual homology and cohomology of a finite group G. A lot of study about this new cohomology has been done and can be found in ([\cite=Brown], Ch. VI) or ([\cite=CaEi], Ch. XII). In particular, in 1992, Benson and Carlson proved that for a finite group G and a field [formula] of characteristic p > 0, if the depth of [formula] is greater than one, products of elements in negative cohomology are zero [\cite=BeCa]. More recently, Bergh and Jorgensen combined the notions of Hochschild cohomology and Tate cohomology to form the Tate-Hochschild cohomology [\cite=BeJo]. In this paper, we explore the structure of the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of a group algebra and generalize some known results about group cohomology to its negative degrees.

The material is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:Tate_RG], we recall the definition and properties of Tate cohomology. Let M be a left RG-module. Then for all [formula]:

[formula]

The readers who are familiar with Tate cohomology can skip this section. In Section [\ref=sec:Tate-Hochschild_RG], we specialize the definition of Tate-Hochschild cohomology in [\cite=BeJo] to the group algebra. Let M be an RG-bimodule. Then for all [formula]:

[formula]

In this section, we also briefly present a cup product that makes the Tate-Hochschild cohomology

[formula]

become a graded ring [\cite=Nguyen]. In Section [\ref=sec:relationship_RG], we reduce the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of RG to its Tate cohomology using a similar argument as in the usual cohomology. In particular, we show that *(RG,RG) is isomorphic to *(G,RG), where RG is a left RG-module via conjugation. In addition, we state known Tate cohomology relations with subgroups, which will be useful in proving our main result. In Section [\ref=sec:decomp], we introduce a generalization of the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring of RG by letting another finite group H act on G and consider *(H,RG). Let [formula] be representatives of the orbits of the action of H on G. Let [formula] be the stabilizer of gi. We show that *(H,RG) decomposes as:

[formula]

In the main Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product], we describe the multiplicative structure of *(H,RG) by giving it a product formula in terms of this additive decomposition. Our work, which uses mainly the idea from [\cite=SW], is a straightforward generalization of the usual group cohomology results. We observe that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring [formula] is a special case of *(H,RG) by letting H = G act on itself by conjugation. Working with this generalization, we prove that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of G decomposes as a direct sum of the Tate cohomology of the centralizers of conjugacy class representatives of G with coefficients in R. Moreover, the product formula reduces the computation of products in *(RG,RG) to products within the Tate cohomology rings of certain subgroups of G. When G is abelian, Cibils and Solotar's result in [\cite=CiSo] is also generalized to the isomorphism [formula] in Proposition [\ref=abelian_RG]. In Section [\ref=sec:S3], we describe the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring of the symmetric group on three elements S3 over a field [formula] of characteristic 3, utilizing the product formula in Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product].

Tate Cohomology of a Group Algebra

Throughout this paper, we let G be a finite group and R be the ring of integers [formula] or a field [formula] of characteristic p > 0 such that p divides the order of G. All rings and algebras are assumed to possess a unit; all modules are assumed to be left modules unless stated otherwise; and tensor products will be over R unless stated otherwise. If [formula] is a field, then [formula] is a finite dimensional, symmetric, and self-injective algebra over [formula] ([\cite=Ben1], Prop. 3.1.2), and hence, projective [formula]-modules are the same as injective [formula]-modules. If G is acting on a set X, then we denote the action gx = gxg- 1, for all g∈G and x∈X.

Let M and N be left RG-modules. Then for any g∈G, m∈M, n∈N, and [formula], we observe some basic facts:

[formula] is a left RG-module via [formula],

[formula] is a left RG-module via (g  ·  f)(m) = g(f(g- 1  ·  m)),

We may regard left RG-modules as right RG-modules via m  ·  g = g- 1  ·  m.

The Tate cohomology for RG is defined in both positive and negative degrees using the following general resolution:

Let R be a two-sided Noetherian ring. A complete resolution of a finitely generated R-module M is an exact complex [formula] of finitely generated projective R-modules such that:

The dual complex [formula] is also exact

There exists a projective resolution [formula] of M and a chain map [formula] where φn is bijective for n  ≥  0 and 0 for n < 0.

We explicitly construct an RG-complete resolution of R as follows. Let

[formula]

be an RG-projective resolution of R, where each Pi is a finitely generated projective RG-module. Apply [formula] to get a dual sequence:

[formula]

which is an exact sequence of RG-modules, since [formula] and [formula] is an exact functor when [formula] is a field (the case [formula] is shown in [\cite=CaEi], Prop. XII.3.3). Splicing these two sequences together, one forms a doubly infinite sequence:

[formula]

We use the notation [formula]. By definition, the above sequence is an RG-complete resolution of R:

[formula]

Let M be any (left) RG-module. Apply [formula] to [formula] and take the homology of this new complex, we obtain the Tate cohomology for RG:

[formula]

Observe that in our context, naturally, the Tate (co)homology is independent of the complete resolution of R ([\cite=AvMa], Theorem 5.2 and Lemma 5.3). One can see this by applying a complete chain map between two complete resolutions of R in both positive and negative degrees. This is the generalized Comparison Theorem on complete resolutions ([\cite=Brown], Prop. VI.3.3).

We note that the Tate cohomology of RG obtains a multiplicative structure as described in ([\cite=Brown], Section VI.5) and ([\cite=CaEi], Sections XII.4 and XII.5). In particular, if M is a ring on which G acts by automorphisms: g  ·  (m1m2) = (g  ·  m1)(g  ·  m2), then *(G,M) becomes an associative graded ring. It is graded-commutative, in the sense that, for α∈i(G,M) and β∈j(G,M), αβ = ( - 1)ijβα ([\cite=CaEi], Props. XII.5.2 and XII.5.3). When M = R, we denote *(G): = *(G,R).

Moreover, for a left RG-module M, we recall the following properties of Tate cohomology ([\cite=Brown], Section VI.5):

For all n > 0, [formula].

This follows from the construction of a complete resolution of R. The positive-degree component of a complete resolution of R arises from a projective resolution of R which is also used to form the usual cohomology groups [formula].

The group 0(G,M) is a quotient of [formula].

The group - 1(G,M) is the dually defined submodule of H0(G,M).

These follow from the construction of complete resolutions.

For all n  <   - 1, we have isomorphisms: [formula].

For any left finitely generated RG-module Pt, the map [formula] is an RG-module isomorphism ([\cite=CaEi], Section XII.3 (5)). It is defined explicitly by: [formula], where m∈M,p∈Pt, and [formula]. With t = n <  - 1, [formula]. Since P- (n + 1) is finitely generated, [formula]. Hence, by the duality isomorphism, we have [formula], which induces the desired isomorphism on homology.

If 0  →  M  →  M'  →  M''  →  0 is a short exact sequence of (left) RG-modules, then there is a doubly infinite long exact sequence of Tate cohomology groups:

[formula]

This is true since the spliced complex [formula] consists of projective modules, so the short exact sequence of modules 0  →  M  →  M'  →  M''  →  0 gives rise to a short exact sequence of complexes:

[formula]

whose cohomology long exact sequence is the desired long exact sequence ([\cite=AvMa], Prop. 5.4).

If (Nj)j∈J is a finite family of (left) RG-modules and (Mi)i∈I is any family of RG-modules, then there are natural isomorphisms, for all [formula]:

[formula]

[formula]

The idea of this proof is similar to that of the usual [formula], using the analogous relation for [formula] ([\cite=AvMa], Prop. 5.7).

In 2011, Bergh and Jorgensen introduced the notion of Tate-Hochschild cohomology which is the extended Hochschild cohomology using complete resolutions [\cite=BeJo]. One natural question to ask is whether the Tate-Hochschild cohomology shares the same properties as those of the usual Hochschild cohomology. In the following sections, we will examine the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of RG and its ring structure.

Tate-Hochschild Cohomology of a Group Algebra

The opposite algebra of RG, denoted by RGop, is RG with the same addition but with multiplication performed in the reverse order. Let [formula] be the enveloping algebra of RG. Since G is finite, RGe is two-sided Noetherian and Gorenstein of Gorenstein dimension 0. Let M be an RG-bimodule. M may be regarded as a left RGe-module by setting [formula], where a∈RG,b∈RGop, and m∈M. In particular, we shall regard RG as a left RGe-module. For any integer [formula], the n-th Tate-Hochschild cohomology of RG is defined as:

[formula]

where the [formula] functor is taken using an RGe-complete resolution of RG. As RGe is a two-sided Noetherian and Gorenstein ring, Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 in [\cite=AvMa] guarantee that every finitely generated RGe-module admits a complete resolution. Hence, we obtain an RGe-complete resolution [formula] for RG. The n-th Tate-Hochschild cohomology group of RG is the n-th homology group of the complex [formula].

Let M and N be RG-bimodules. Then [formula] is also an RG-bimodule, which can be considered as a left RGe-module via [formula], where a∈RG,b∈RGop,m∈M, and n∈N. There is a cup product on Tate-Hochschild cohomology:

[formula]

which we describe as follows. Let [formula] be any RGe-complete resolution of RG. The complete tensor product [formula] is obtained by defining:

[formula]

By the same argument as in ([\cite=Brown], Section VI.5) or ([\cite=Nguyen], Section 6.1), [formula] is an acyclic chain complex of RGe-modules. Lemma 6.5 in [\cite=Nguyen] shows the existence of a complete diagonal approximation chain map [formula] that preserves the augmentation.

Given graded modules B,B',C,C' and module homomorphisms u:C  →  B of degree i and v:C'  →  B' of degree j, there is a map uv:CC'  →  BB' of degree i + j defined by:

[formula]

Let [formula] represent an element of i(RG,M) and let [formula] represent an element of j(RG,N). Then:

[formula]

represents an element of [formula]. One can check that this product is independent of [formula] and Γ and satisfies the usual cup product properties. When M = N = RG, this cup product gives *(RG,RG) the structure of an associative graded ring, as [formula].

Reduction to Tate Cohomology and Relations with Subgroups

We show here that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology of RG can be reduced to its Tate cohomology. We begin with a lemma which is based on the original Eckmann-Shapiro Lemma but is generalized to a complete resolution:

Let H be a subgroup of a finite group G, M be a left RH-module and N be a left RG-module. Consider [formula] to be a left RH-module via restriction of the action, and let [formula] denote the induced RG-module where G acts on the leftmost factor by multiplication. Then for all [formula], there is an isomorphism of abelian groups:

[formula]

For any subgroup H  ⊆  G, every RH-complete resolution gives rise to an RG-complete resolution by inducing the modules (induction takes projectives to projectives, and exact sequences to exact sequences). Since coinduction is the same as induction in the finite group case ([\cite=Brown], Prop. III.5.9), the proof for this lemma goes through in the present context and follows from the Nakayama relations ([\cite=Ben1], Prop. 2.8.3).

We have [formula] as algebras via g  ↦  g- 1, and [formula] as algebras. As a result, [formula]. Here, RG is a left R(G  ×  G)-module by the two-sided action: (g1,g2)  ·  g  =  g1gg- 12. So RG is just the permutation module [formula] on the cosets of the diagonal δ(G) = {(g,g)  |  g∈G}. Moreover, any RG-bimodule M may be considered as a left RG-module with action given by g  ·  m  =  gmg- 1, for all g∈G and m∈M. It follows from this discussion and Lemma [\ref=Eckmann-Shapiro_RG] that:

[formula]

The Tate-Hochschild cohomology of G with coefficients in the bimodule M is just the Tate cohomology of G with coefficients in M under the diagonal action. When M is an algebra itself with compatible G-action, this is in fact an algebra isomorphism as it respects the cup products defined for Tate and Tate-Hochschild cohomology ([\cite=Nguyen], Theorem 7.2). In particular, when M = RG with G-action via conjugation,

[formula]

Therefore, all properties of *(G,RG) that we observed in Section [\ref=sec:Tate_RG] transfer to those for the Tate-Hochschild cohomology.

Let H be a subgroup of G. By restricting the action, any RG-module N may be regarded as an RH-module and any RG-complete resolution [formula] of R may also be considered as an RH-complete resolution. Sections XII.8 and XII.9 in [\cite=CaEi] show that there are maps in the Tate cohomology with properties analogous to those in the usual group cohomology:

The restriction map:

[formula]

which is induced from the inclusion [formula].

The corestriction map (or transfer):

[formula]

which is given on the cochain level by defining:

[formula]

where G denotes a set of left coset representatives of H in G, [formula], and p∈Pi. One can check that this definition is independent of the choice of the representatives g∈G.

Moreover, for any g∈G, there is an isomorphism:

[formula]

defined on the cochain level as (g*f)(p) = g(f(g- 1p).

We shall list some properties of these maps without proving them. The proof goes through using similar arguments as in [\cite=CaEi]. The readers can refer to [\cite=CaEi] for more details.

Let K  ⊆  H  ⊆  G be subgroups, and N1,N2 be RG-modules which may be regarded as RH-modules. Let αi∈*(G,Ni), βi∈*(H,Ni), and gi∈G, for i = 1,2. Then the maps defined above satisfy:

g*1g*2 = (g1g2)*

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let H,K  ⊆  G be subgroups and N be an RG-module which may be regarded as an RH (or RK)-module. The map [formula] is given by:

[formula]

where β∈*(H,N) and D is a set of double coset representatives such that [formula] is a disjoint union.

Generalized Additive Decomposition

For the rest of this paper, we let H be another finite group which acts as automorphisms on G. Via this action, RG becomes an RH-module. The multiplication map [formula] is an RH-module homomorphism. Hence, it induces the ring structure on cohomology *(H,RG): = *RH(R,RG) by compositing with the cup product. We will study the additive decomposition of this ring *(H,RG). The Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring [formula] is a special case of *(H,RG) by letting H = G act on itself by conjugation.

If H acts trivially on G, then [formula] as graded R-algebras. In particular, if G is abelian, then

[formula]

If G is abelian, H = G acting on itself by conjugation yields the trivial action. Hence, the second statement follows from the first statement and the isomorphism ([\ref=THdecomp_eq:1]):

[formula]

To prove the first statement, let [formula] be an RH-complete resolution of R. Since H acts trivially on G, RG is a trivial RH-module and is free as an R-module. We claim that [formula] is an isomorphism. It can be seen by sending [formula], where F(p) = f(p)g, for [formula], and g∈G. It is easy to check that [formula] and it is a cocycle when f is. Hence, passing to the homology, γ induces an isomorphism of graded R-modules:

[formula]

The definition of cup product corresponds to this map, making γ* a ring homomorphism.

This proposition helps us to find and study the structure of the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring of a finite abelian group algebra, given its Tate cohomology ring. For example, knowing the Tate cohomology of a cyclic group G, (see [\cite=CaEi], Section XII.7), one can easily compute its Tate-Hochschild cohomology by applying Proposition [\ref=abelian_RG].

Now we return to the general case where H acts on G non-trivially and G is not necessarily abelian. Let [formula] be representatives of the orbits of the action of H on G. Let [formula] be the stabilizer of gi. For any g∈G, there are two [formula]-module homomorphisms:

[formula]

[formula]

If V is any subgroup of [formula], then these maps induce maps on cohomology:

[formula]

[formula]

since * is covariant in the second argument. The following properties of θ*g and π*g will help us in proving the main result.

Let h∈H and a,b∈G.

If V is a subgroup of [formula], then [formula] as maps from *(V) to *(hV,RG).

Suppose [formula] and α,β∈*(V). Then:

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then θ*a and π*a commute with [formula] and [formula].

If [formula], then [formula], where [formula] is the identity map on *(V) and δa,b is the Kronecker delta.

Lemma 5.2 in [\cite=SW] showed these properties in positive degrees. We generalize the proof to negative degrees and present it on the cochain level. The desired results are induced on cohomology.

Let [formula] be an RV-complete resolution of R, [formula] be a cocycle representing an element of i(V), and p∈Pi. Then

[formula]

Let [formula] be the multiplication map and [formula] be a complete diagonal approximation map. Let [formula] represent α,β∈*(V), respectively. Then on the cochain level:

[formula]

where the left side represents [formula] and the right side represents [formula].

Let [formula] be an RV-complete resolution of R which can also be regarded as an RV'-complete resolution by restricting the action. Let [formula] represent an element of i(V',RG), [formula] represent an element of i(V'), and p∈Pi.

[formula]

since [formula], we have v- 1a = a, and V acts trivially on R. Similarly,

[formula]

The other cases follow similarly by commutativity between πa, θa and the inclusion map [formula], where N = RG or R.

Let r∈R.

[formula]

For all [formula], let ψi:*(Hi,R)  →  *(H,RG) be defined as the composition [formula]. We describe the additive decomposition that is generalized from the usual cohomology ([\cite=Ben2], Theorem 2.11.2):

The map [formula], sending [formula], is an isomorphism of graded R-modules, for ζ∈*(H,RG). Its inverse sends α∈*(Hi,R) to ψi(α)∈*(H,RG).

For [formula], let Mi be the free R-module generated by elements of the orbit containing gi. Then [formula]. There is an isomorphism [formula] given by [formula]. It induces an isomorphism in cohomology [formula].

Since [formula] is additive, [formula]. Apply the Eckmann-Shapiro Lemma [\ref=Eckmann-Shapiro_RG], we have [formula]. One can also check directly that the maps given in the statement of the lemma are inverses of each other by taking their compositions and applying Proposition [\ref=THdecomp_prop] and Lemma [\ref=THdecomp_lemma] to show that their compositions are the identity maps.

In 1999, Siegel and Witherspoon showed that there is a product formula for the usual Hochschild cohomology of G in terms of a similar additive decomposition ([\cite=SW], Theorem 5.1). We will describe products in *(H,RG) with respect to the isomorphism in Lemma [\ref=THdecomp]. The argument will be analogous to that in [\cite=SW] but is generalized to the Tate cohomology.

Fix [formula]. Let D be a set of double coset representatives for [formula]. For each x∈D, there is a unique k = k(x) such that

[formula]

for some y∈H. One can expand the action on the right hand side and get gk  =    y(gi  xgj) showing that gk is just a representative of an orbit of the action of H on the double coset HixHj. Moreover, k is independent of the choice of double coset representative x. The set of all y satisfying ([\ref=THdecomp_eq:2]) is also a double coset. To see this, let us fix y = y(x) for which ([\ref=THdecomp_eq:2]) holds. Let y'∈H be another element such that gk  =    y'gi  y'xgj. Then y'gi  y'xgj  =  gk  =    ygi  yxgj implies y'(gi  xgj) =   y(gi  xgj). Let h = y'y- 1. We have hgk  =    h(y(gi  xgj)) =   y'(gi  xgj) = gk showing [formula]. On the other hand, if h∈Hk, then let y' = hy∈H, we have hygi  hyxgj  =    h(ygi  yxgj)  =    hgk  =  gk. Putting together, we have shown:

[formula]

where the last equality follows from ([\ref=THdecomp_eq:2]) and [formula]. We can now prove our main result which provides a formula for products in *(H,RG) with respect to Lemma [\ref=THdecomp].

Let α∈*(Hi) and β∈*(Hj). Then

[formula]

where D is a set of double coset representatives for [formula], k = k(x) and y = y(x) are chosen to satisfy ([\ref=THdecomp_eq:2]), and [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=THdecomp],

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=THdecomp_lemma] (d), the only terms that can be non-zero in the next to last step are those for which gk  =    ygi  yxgj. We have seen in the discussion prior to this theorem that each x determines a unique k and double coset [formula] for which this holds. Therefore, we may take y = y(x) and [formula]. Hence, [formula].

We observe that when i = 1, ψ1:*(H,R)  →  *(H,RG) is an algebra monomorphism that is induced by the algebra homomorphism R  →  RG mapping r  ↦  r1. Alternatively, by letting i = j = 1 in Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product], we see that ψ1 respects the cup product:

[formula]

where α,β∈*(H). Hence, via ψ1, we may view *(H,RG) as a (left) *(H)-module with action via multiplying (on the left) by ψ1(*(H)). Each *(Hi) may also be regarded as an *(H)-module via restriction. As a consequence, we obtain:

The isomorphism in Lemma [\ref=THdecomp] is an isomorphism of graded *(H)-modules:

[formula]

For i = 1, let α∈*(H) and β∈*(Hj). Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product] reduces to:

[formula]

where the left hand side is considered as action of *(H) on *(H,RG) that corresponds to the action of *(H) on each *(Hj) on the right hand side, via the isomorphism in Lemma [\ref=THdecomp].

As noted in the remark following Lemma [\ref=THdecomp], when H = G acts on itself by conjugation, Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product] gives a formula for the multiplicative structure of [formula] in terms of this decomposition. It reduces the computation of products in *(RG,RG) to products within the Tate cohomology rings of certain subgroups of G. In the next section, we will show a basic non-abelian example that demonstrates the usefulness of Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product].

The symmetric group on three elements

Let [formula] be a field of characteristic 3. Let [formula] act on itself by conjugation. Without loss of generality, we choose conjugacy class representatives g1 = 1, g2 = a, and g3 = b whose centralizers are H1 = G, H2  =  {1,a,a2} = :N, and H3  =  {1,b}, respectively. We will find the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring of [formula] using elements of [formula] and the product formula given in Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product].

Let us examine each ring [formula]. Since the characteristic of [formula] is 3 and N is cyclic of order 3, the cohomology ring *(N) is periodic by ([\cite=CaEi], Theorem XII.11.6) and ([\cite=Ben], (4.1.3)). By direct computation from Section XII.7 in [\cite=CaEi], *(N) is of the form [formula], where Λ(w1) is the exterior [formula]-algebra on the element w1 of degree 1 and [formula] is generated by the elements w2 of degree 2 and w- 12 of degree - 2, subject to the graded-commutative relations and w2w- 12 = 1. By a similar computation, because the characteristic of [formula] does not divide the order of H3  =  {1,b}, we find that n(H3) = 0 in all degrees. As a result, *(H3) = 0.

We now compute the Tate cohomology ring of G = S3 with coefficients in [formula]. N is a normal subgroup of G. The quotient group G / N is (isomorphic to) [formula]. It is easy to check that G is isomorphic to a semidirect product [formula] and every abelian subgroup of G is cyclic. It follows from ([\cite=CaEi], Theorem XII.11.6) and ([\cite=Ben], (4.1.3)) that the Tate cohomology ring *(G) is periodic and Noetherian. One can directly compute *(G) by using an N-complete resolution of [formula], imposing on it an action of [formula] to make it become a G-complete resolution of [formula], computing the Tate cohomology groups from that resolution, and studying their products. Alternatively, following the discussion in ([\cite=CaEi], Section XII.10), we see that for any G-module M, *(G,M) is a direct sum of *(G,M,p), where *(G,M,p) is the p-primary component of *(G,M) and p runs through all the prime divisors of |G| = 6. Here, [formula] is a field of characteristic 3, so only the 3-primary component is non-zero. By ([\cite=CaEi], Theorem XII.10.1), G / N operates on *(N) and so [formula]. Therefore, *(G) is of the form [formula], where x and z are of degrees 3 and 4, respectively, subject to the graded-commutative relations.

By the decomposition Lemma [\ref=THdecomp], [formula] as graded [formula]-modules. We then can define elements of the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring of [formula] as follows. Since ψ1 is an algebra monomorphism, we may identify any element of *(G) with its image under ψ1. Let Ei  =  ψi(1), Wi  =  ψ2(wi), for i = 1,2, and W- 12  =  ψ2(w- 12). For simplification, we will use C: = E2 + 1 in the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a field of characteristic 3 and S3 be the symmetric group on three elements. Then the Tate-Hochschild cohomology [formula] of S3 is generated as an algebra by elements x,z,z- 1,C,W1,W2, and W- 12 of degrees 3,4, - 4,0,1,2, and - 2, respectively, subject to the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

together with the graded-commutative relations. In particular, the algebra monomorphism [formula] induces an isomorphism modulo radicals.

[formula] is a graded-commutative [formula]-algebra whose underlying [formula]-module is isomorphic to [formula]. Here, *(G) is a graded subalgebra of [formula] generated by x, z and z- 1. Additionally, ψ2(*(N)) is a graded *(G)-submodule of [formula] generated by E2, W1, W2 and W- 12. This follows from the discussion after the proof of Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product]. Moreover, we will check that these generators satisfy the following conditions:

action on ψ2(*(N)) as an *(G)-module, and

every product in ψ2(*(N)) can be expressed as the sum of an element of *(G) and a *(G)-linear combination of the images under ψ2 of the generators of *(N).

Therefore, it is clear that [formula] is generated as a [formula]-algebra by x,z,z- 1,E2,W1,W2, and W- 12, subject to these conditions. The first line of the relations in the statement of the theorem satisfies the first condition. The second and third lines satisfy the second condition. We will check each of them in detail.

The restriction [formula], which sends x  ↦  w1w2, z  ↦  w22, and z- 1  ↦  w- 22, is injective. We also observe that by graded-commutativity of the Tate cohomology ring, every element of odd degree has square 0. In particular, w1w1  =   - w1w1 implies w21 = 0. One can check that *(N) is an *(G)-module with action via [formula]:

[formula]

Therefore, as an *(G)-module, *(N) is generated by 1,w1,w2 and w- 12, subject to the relation x  ·  w1  =  0, x  ·  w2  =  z  ·  w1, and z- 1  ·  w1  =  (xz- 1)  ·  w- 12. By the isomorphism in Lemma [\ref=THdecomp] and mapping through ψ2, we obtain the first line of the relations.

To check the second and third lines of the relations, we recall the fact that the submodule of invariants [formula] is the center [formula] of the group algebra [formula], which is generated by conjugacy class representatives of G. Therefore, we may identify the degree-0 Tate-Hochschild cohomology with a quotient of [formula], as [formula] is a quotient of [formula]. Under this identification, Ei corresponds to (a quotient of) the sum of the group elements conjugate to gi. In particular,

[formula]

in characteristic 3, which implies

[formula]

For the rest of the relations, we use the product formula in Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product]. Let α and β be elements of *(N), we have:

[formula]

Recall that b*:*(N)  →  *(bN)  =  *(N). By checking on the definition of b* and the degrees of wi, we see that b*(w- 12) =  - w- 12 and b*(wi) =  - wi, for i = 1,2. Moreover, as there are no degree-1,2 and - 2 elements in *(G), we have [formula]. Similarly, by checking on the cochain level and using Lemma [\ref=THdecomp_prop] (10), for all [formula], we obtain:

[formula]

Hence, using Lemma [\ref=THdecomp_prop] (10) again,

[formula]

Let α = 1 and β = w1, using the product formula in Theorem [\ref=THdecomp_product], we obtain:

[formula]

So CW1  =  (E2 + 1)W1  =  E2W1  +  W1  =   - W1  +  W1  =  0. Similarly, let α = 1 and β = w2 or w- 12, we show that CW2 = 0 = CW- 12. This proves the second line of the relations.

Let α  =  β = w2, we have:

[formula]

Similarly, for α  =  β = w- 12, we acquire that W- 22  =  z- 1C.

Let α = w1 and β = w- 12:

[formula]

Using the same argument, for α = w1 and β = w2, we obtain W1W2 = xC. Thus, we have found all necessary relations for the generators of [formula]. Furthermore, because the ring [formula] is graded-commutative, its nilpotent elements all lie in its radical. We observe that C2 = 0 = W21, W32  =  W22W2  =  zCW2 = 0, and (W- 12)3  =  W- 22W- 12  =  z- 1CW- 12 = 0. This implies that C,W1,W2, and W- 12 are contained in the radical of the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring [formula]. Consequently, modulo radicals, the algebra monomorphism [formula] induces an isomorphism.
