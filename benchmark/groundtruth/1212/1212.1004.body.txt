Rates of convergence of extremes from skew normal samples

Abstract  For a skew normal random sequence, convergence rates of the distribution of its partial maximum to the Gumbel extreme value distribution are derived. The asymptotic expansion of the distribution of the normalized maximum is given under an optimal choice of norming constants. We find that the optimal convergence rate of the normalized maximum to the Gumbel extreme value distribution is proportional to 1 /  log n.

Introduction

The biggest weakness of the normal distribution is its inability to model skewed data. This has led to several skewed extensions of the normal distribution. The most popular and the most studied of these extensions is the skew normal distribution due to Azzalini (1985). A random variable X is said to have a standard skew-normal distribution with shape parameter λ∈R (written as [formula]) if its probability density function (pdf) is

[formula]

where φ(  ·  ) denotes the standard normal pdf and Φ(  ·  ) denotes the standard normal cumulative distribution function (cdf). It is known that [formula] is a standard normal random variable.

The skew normal distribution has received more applications than any other extension of the normal distribution. Its applications are too many to list. Some applications of the skew normal distribution that have appeared in the past year alone include: the distribution of threshold voltage degradation in nanoscale transistors by using reaction-diffusion and percolation theory (Islam and Alam, 2011); population structure of Schima superba in Qingliangfeng National Nature Reserve (Liu et al., 2011); rain height models to predict fading due to wet snow on terrestrial links (Paulson and Al-Mreri, 2011); modeling of seasonal rainfall in Africa (Siebert and Ward, 2011); modeling of HIV viral loads (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012); multisite flooding hazard assessment in the Upper Mississippi River (Ghizzoni et al., 2012); modeling of diabetic macular Edema data (Mansourian et al., 2012); risks of macroeconomic forecasts (Pinheiro and Esteves, 2012); modeling of current account balance data (Saez et al., 2012); automated neonatal EEG classification (Temko et al., 2012).

The aim of this note is to establish the convergence rate of the distribution of the maxima for samples obeying [formula]. Chang and Genton (2007) showed that [formula] belongs to the domain of attraction of the Gumbel extreme value distribution Λ(x) =  exp ( -  exp ( - x)). Rates of convergence of the distribution of maxima for a sequence of independent SN(0) random variables were studied by Hall (1979), Leadbetter et al. (1983) and Nair (1981). Precisely speaking, Leadbetter et al. (1983) proved that

[formula]

holds for large n with normalized constants αn and βn given by

[formula]

The optimal uniform convergence rate of [formula] to Λ(x) due to Hall (1979) is

[formula]

for some absolute constants [formula] with normalized constants [formula] and [formula] determined by

[formula]

The following more informative result was established by Nair (1981):

[formula]

where the normalized constants [formula] and [formula] are given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are defined as

[formula]

The contents of this note are organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec2] derives some preliminary results related to [formula] like Mills inequalities, Mills ratios, and the distributional tail representation of [formula] for λ  ≠  0. Convergence rates of the distribution of the maxima of [formula] and related proofs are given in Section [\ref=sec3]. In the sequel we shall assume that the shape parameter λ  ≠  0.

Preliminary results

In this section, some preliminary but important properties about [formula] are derived. These properties not only imply that [formula] belongs to the max-domain of attraction of the Gumbel extreme value distribution but they also help us to find two pairs of norming constants.

The following Mills inequality and Mills ratio about [formula] due to Mills (1926) are needed in this section, i.e.,

[formula]

for all x > 0 and

[formula]

as x  →    ∞  . For some improved Mills inequalities, see Mitrinovi and Vasi (1970, pages 177-180) and references therein.

First we derive Mills inequalities and Mills ratios of [formula], which are stated as follows.

Let Fλ(x) and fλ(x) denote the cdf and the pdf of [formula], respectively. For all x > 0, we have

if λ > 0,

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

as x  →    ∞  ;

if λ < 0,

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

as x  →    ∞  .

Proof. For x > 0,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

In the case of λ > 0, by [\eqref=eq4.2], we can get

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

By using [\eqref=eq4.1] and [\eqref=eq1.15], we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq4.3] with [\eqref=eq4.4], we can derive [\eqref=eq1.1] and [\eqref=eq1.3].

In the case of λ < 0, by [\eqref=eq4.2] and [\eqref=eq1.15], we have

[formula]

For x > 0,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq4.5] with [\eqref=eq4.6], we can derive [\eqref=eq1.2] and [\eqref=eq1.4].

By Proposition [\ref=pro1.1], we can derive the distributional tail representation of the skew normal distribution. This representation is useful to find optimal normalized constants to establish expansions of the distribution of the maxima for [formula] samples. Similar expansions for [formula] samples were given in Nair (1981).

Let Fλ(x) and fλ(x) denote the cdf and the pdf of [formula], respectively. Then,

[formula]

for large x, where c(x), g(x) and the auxiliary function f(x) are determined according to the sign of λ, i.e.,

for λ > 0,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

for λ < 0,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=pro1.2] shows that Fλ∈D(Λ) by Corollary 1.7 of Resnick (1987). The norming constants an and bn can be determined by

[formula]

such that

[formula]

By using Mills ratio of the skew normal distribution and arguments similar to the case of [formula] provided in Leadbetter et al. (1983), we can choose another pair of normalized constants such that [\eqref=eq1.13] holds.

Let (Xn,n  ≥  1) be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with common cdf Fλ(x). Let Mn  =   max (Xk,1  ≤  k  ≤  n) denote the partial maximum. Then

[formula]

where the norming constants αn and βn are given by

[formula]

for λ > 0, and by

[formula]

for λ < 0.

Proof. First we consider the case of λ > 0. As Fλ is continuous, for x∈R, there exists un = un(x) such that n(1 - Fλ(un)) = e- x. By using [\eqref=eq1.3], we have

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  , and so

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  , which implies

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  . Taking logarithms, we have

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  , so

[formula]

Noting that lim n  →    ∞Φ(λun) = 1 for λ > 0 and putting [\eqref=eq4.22] into [\eqref=eq4.21], we have

[formula]

So, by Theorem 1.2.3 and Theorem 1.5.1 of Leadbetter et al. (1983), we have

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly, for λ < 0 there exists vn = vn(x) such that n(1 - Fλ(vn)) = e- x. By using [\eqref=eq1.4] and [\eqref=eq1.16], we have

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  . By arguments similar to the case of λ > 0, we can derive

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

The proof is complete.

Convergence rates of extremes

In this section, we establish two different convergence rates of the distribution of Mn: one for the norming constants αn and βn given by Proposition [\ref=pro1.3], and the other for the norming constants an and bn determined by [\eqref=eq1.12].

For norming constants αn and βn given by Proposition [\ref=pro1.3], we have

For λ > 0,

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  ;

For λ < 0,

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  .

Proof. Set un  =  αnx + βn and τn = n(1 - Fλ(un)), where αn and βn are given by Proposition [\ref=pro1.3].

For λ > 0,

[formula]

implies

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Noting that [formula] for large n and rewriting [\eqref=eq1.1] as

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Obviously, for τ(x) = e- x,

[formula]

for large n. So, by using Theorem 2.4.2 of Leadbetter et al. (1983), we can get [\eqref=eq2.1].

In the case of λ < 0, using [\eqref=eq1.2] and the following fact

[formula]

we can get [\eqref=eq2.2] by arguments similar to the case of λ > 0.

Theorem [\ref=thm2.2] shows that the convergence rates of the distribution of the normalized maxima are different even though both [\eqref=eq1.13] and [\eqref=eq1.14] hold, which implies αn / an  →  1 and (βn - bn) / an  →  0 by Khintchine Theorem (cf. Leadbetter et al. (1983), Resnick (1987)). The auxiliary function f(x) of the distributional tail representation of Fλ(x) plays an important role on the convergence rates for distributions belonging to the domain of attraction of the Gumbel extreme value distribution. For related work, see Peng et al. (2010) and Liao and Peng (2012): Peng et al. (2010) derived convergence rates of the distribution of maxima for random sequences obeying the general error distribution; Liao and Peng (2012) derived convergence rates of the distribution of maxima for random sequences obeying the lognormal distribution. Another interesting application of the auxiliary function f(x) is to characterize F∈D(Λ). For more details, see Goldie and Resnick (1988).

For norming constants an and bn given by [\eqref=eq1.12], we have

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  , where both κ(x) and ω(x) may depend on λ according to the sign of λ as:

for λ > 0,

[formula]

for λ < 0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm2.2], we need two lemmas. The first lemma is about a decomposition of the distributional tail representation of the skew normal distribution.

Let Fλ(x) denote the cdf of the skew normal distribution. For large x, we have

for λ > 0,

[formula]

with f(t) and g(t) given by [\eqref=eq1.7] and [\eqref=eq1.8], respectively;

for λ < 0,

[formula]

with f(t) and g(t) given by [\eqref=eq1.10] and [\eqref=eq1.11], respectively.

Proof. By integration by parts, we have

[formula]

It is easy to check that both

[formula]

and

[formula]

hold for x > 0.

For λ > 0, it is obvious that x5φ(λx)  →  0 and Φ(λx)  →  1 as x  →    ∞  . So, by [\eqref=eq4.9], [\eqref=addpeng2] and [\eqref=addpeng3], we can get

[formula]

which is [\eqref=eq4.7].

In the case of λ < 0, first notice that

[formula]

for large x, cf. Castro (1987). So, by [\eqref=eq4.9] and [\eqref=eq1.17], we have

[formula]

which is [\eqref=eq4.8]. The proof is complete.

To prove [\eqref=eq2.3], we need the following auxiliary result.

Let Hλ(bn;x) = Fλ(anx + bn) and hλ(bn;x) = n log Hλ(bn;x)  +  e- x with the normalized constants an and bn given by [\eqref=eq1.12]. Then,

[formula]

where κ(x) and ω(x) are those given by Theorem [\ref=thm2.2].

Proof. First, we consider the case of λ > 0. Obviously, bn  →    ∞   if and only if n  →    ∞   since 1 - Fλ(bn) = n- 1. The following two facts hold by Proposition [\ref=pro1.1]:

[formula]

and

[formula]

For simplicity, let

[formula]

Then lim n  →    ∞Aλ(bn)  =  1 and

[formula]

So, we can check that both

[formula]

and

[formula]

hold. By [\eqref=eq4.7], we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq1.3], [\eqref=eq4.11], [\eqref=eq4.12], [\eqref=eq4.13], [\eqref=eq4.14] and [\eqref=eq4.15] together, we have

[formula]

where the last step follows by the dominated convergence theorem. It remains to prove [\eqref=eq4.10] for λ > 0. By arguments similar to those of [\eqref=addpeng1], we have

[formula]

Second, we consider the case of λ < 0. By [\eqref=eq1.4], [\eqref=eq1.10], and arguments similar to the case of λ > 0, we can see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

hold. Setting

[formula]

we have lim n  →    ∞Bλ(bn) = 1 and

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

and

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq4.8], we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq1.4], [\eqref=eq4.16], [\eqref=eq4.17], [\eqref=eq4.18], [\eqref=eq4.19] and [\eqref=eq4.20] together, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The claimed result follows for λ < 0. The proof is complete.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2.2]. Obviously, by Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have hλ(bn;x)  →  0 and

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  . By using Lemma [\ref=lem2] once again, we have

[formula]

The desired result follows.

Theorem [\ref=thm2.2] establishes the asymptotic expansion of Fnλ(anx + bn). Meanwhile the convergence rate of Fnλ(anx + bn) to its limit distribution Λ(x) is proportional to 1 /  log n by Theorem [\ref=thm2.2] since one can check that [formula] through [\eqref=eq1.12].
