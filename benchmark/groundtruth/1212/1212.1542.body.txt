Separating properties for normal ultrafilters

Introduction

Suppose κ is a measurable cardinal, and U is a normal ultrafilter on κ. Let p0,p1 be two properties (defined by some formula) and set A0  =  {α  <  κ:p0(α)},A1  =  {α  <  κ:p1(α)}. We are interested in the possibility that A0∈U yet A1∉U.

Of course, this may happen trivially. For instance, let p0 be the property of being weakly compact, and let p1 be the opposite property of being not weakly compact. In this case, A0∈U and A1∉U for every normal U on every measurable κ.

To avoid this kind of trivialities, we shall ask for a measurable cardinal κ which carries two normal ultrafilters V,W. For V we shall have A0,A1∈V, and for W we will be able to separate, namely A0∈W but A1∉W. The existence of V shows that the separation is not construed on trivial grounds.

The following definition sets our terminology:

Cognate properties and separability. Assume κ is a measurable cardinal, p0,p1 are two properties of ordinals, and A0  =  {α  <  κ:p0(α)},A1  =  {α  <  κ:p1(α)}.

p0 and p1 are cognates (for κ) if there exists a normal ultrafilter U on κ such that A0,A1∈U.

p0 and p1 are separable (for κ) if they are cognates (for κ), but there is also a normal ultrafilter W on κ such that A0∈W and A1∉W.

We emphasize that the interesting problem is whether two properties are cognates and separable on the same κ. Moreover, we are looking for separability at every measurable cardinal κ. The following theorem of Solovay (see [\cite=MR1994835], 5.16) is a good example:

Normal ultrafilters which do not contain measurables. For every measurable cardinal κ there exists a normal ultrafilter U such that the set {α  <  κ:α is not a measurable cardinal } belongs to U.

[formula]

In our terminology, we can define p0 as being weakly compact, and p1 as being measurable. The sets A0,A1 are defined respectively. The theorem of Solovay says that p0 and p1 are separable for every measurable cardinal κ which carries a normal ultrafilter U concentrating on the measurables.

Some point should be stretched here. If κ is the first measurable cardinal, then every normal U on κ separates p0 from p1, as the set of measurables below κ is empty. The theorem of Solovay begins to be interesting for higher measurables, on which a normal V that contains the measurables exists as well. The same point will arise in the theorems below.

Let us fix three properties for the rest of the paper:

p0 is the property of being measurable.

p1 is the property of being compact.

p2 is the property of being supercompact.

The corresponding sets A0,A1,A2 are defined in accordance with p0,p1,p2. We shall see that all of them can be cognates, but p0,p1 are never separable, and p1,p2 are separable. We indicate (in light of the above paragraph) that there exists a measurbale cardinal κ and a normal U on κ such that A0∈U and A1∉U, but p0 and p1 are not cognates for this κ, and it will be the case for every normal ultrafilter on this κ. If there is one normal U on some κ which contains the compact cardinals, then for every normal ultrafilter on κ, we shall get A0∈U  ⇒  A1∈U.

In fact, we shall prove the following:

measurable and compcat cardinals. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let U be a normal ultrafilter on κ such that A0∈U. Then A1∈U iff κ is a limit of compact cardinals.

[formula]

This theorem means that the case of A0∈U and A1∉U (for a normal U on κ) happens only in the trivial case, in which the set of compact cardinals is bounded below κ. It follows that if one normal ultrafilter on κ contains A1, then all the normal ultrafilters on κ contain A1, provided that A0 is in the ultrafilter, of course.

The other side of the coin is captured in the second theorem:

compact and supercompact cardinals. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let V be a normal ultrafilter on κ such that A2∈V. Then there is another normal ultrafilter W on κ such that A1∈W but A2∉W.

[formula]

In the second part of the paper, we apply separating properties to a problem concerning the number of normal ultrafilters which contain the non-measurables. We show that such properties enable us to create different normal ultrafilters by summing over a sequence of normal measures.

We conclude this introduction with an additional point of view. Magidor has proved in [\cite=MR0429566] the consistency of the following:

The first compact is also the first measurable.

The first compact is also the first supercompact.

In the phraseology of Magidor, these facts demonstrate an identity crisis of the compactness notion. We suggest the separability as another criterion for determining the identity of large cardinals. Due to the theorems above, compactness cannot be separated from measurability, but it is far from supercompactness (as much as normal ultrafilters are concerned).

We shall try to use standard notation, following [\cite=MR1940513] and [\cite=MR1994835]. Recall that κ is measurable if there exists a κ-complete non-principal ultrafilter on κ, so [formula] is included, but throughout the paper we always mean that a measurable cardinal is uncountable. κ is 1-extendible it there exists an elementary embedding [formula] so that [formula]. κ is compact if Lκκ is compact (and here, again, we assume that κ is uncountable). κ is γ-supercompact if there exists an elementary embedding [formula] so that [formula] and γM  ⊆  M. Finally, κ is supercompact if κ is γ-supercompact for every γ.

I thank professor Saharon Shelah for a very helpful discussion on the subject of this paper.

Separating theorems

We commence with a general simple lemma:

Suppose that:

κ is a measurable cardinal.

U is a normal ultrafilter on κ.

S∈U.

T is an unbounded subset of κ.

Then the set S' = {α∈S:α is a limit of members from T} belongs to U.

Proof. Assume toward contradiction that S'∉U, so [formula]. For every [formula] we define f(α) =  sup{β  <  α:β∈T}. By the definition of S', each member α of [formula] is not a limit of members from T, hence f(α) < α. It follows that f is a regressive function on [formula]. As U is normal (and [formula]) there is an ordinal γ  <  κ and a subset [formula] such that:

[formula]

But X∈U, so in particular X is unbounded in κ. It follows that T  ⊆  γ + 1, in contrary to assumption (d) of the lemma.

[formula]

Menas proved (in [\cite=MR0357121]) that if κ is a measurable cardinal, limit of compact cardinals, then κ is a compact cardinal. Combining this theorem with the lemma above, we can conclude:

Suppose that:

κ is a measurable cardinal.

U is a normal ultrafilter on κ.

U contains the set of measurables below κ.

Then U contains the set of compact cardinals below κ iff κ is a limit of compact cardinals.

Proof. Clearly, if the set of compact cardinals below κ is bounded then it is not in U. Assume that this set is unbounded in κ. Denote the set of measurable cardinals below κ by S (so S∈U by assumption (c)), and the set of compact cardinals below κ by T.

Applying Lemma [\ref=llll] we know that the set S' = {α∈S:α is a limit of compact cardinals } belongs to U. By the theorem of Menas, S' is a set of compact cardinals, hence S'  ⊆  T. It follows that T∈U, as required.

[formula]

The meaning of this claim is that the properties p0,p1 are not separable. In other words, if κ carries a mormal ultrafilter U which contains the compact cardinlas below κ, then every normal ultrafilter V which contains the measurables must agree with U about the compact cardinlas below κ.

It is consistent that κ is a measurable cardinal, U is a normal ultrafilter on κ, the set of measurables belongs to U, yet U does not contain the set of compact cardinlas below κ.

Indeed, take the model of Magidor, in which the first compact κ is also the first supercompact. Being supercompact entails the existence of a normal U which contains the measurables, and being the first compact means that the set of compact cardinlas below κ is empty. Nevertheless, in this case every normal V on κ which contains the measurables, behaves like U.

[formula]

Our goal is to prove that p1 and p2 are separable for every relevant κ. We shall prove this by induction on the measurables, and it holds for every measurable cardinal κ for which p1 and p2 are cognates. Let us phrase the accurate assertion:

Compactness and Supercompactness. If κ is a measurable cardinal, V is a normal ultrafilter on κ, and A2∈V, then there is a normal ultrafilter W on κ such that A1∈W but A2∉W.

Proof. By induction on the measurables which carry a normal ultrafilter V so that A2∈V. Suppose we have arrived at κ which satisfies this assumption, and the theorem holds below κ. For every measurable cardinal α below κ we choose a normal ultrafilter Uα on α as follows:

If there is no normal ultrafilter on α which contains the measurables, then let Uα be any normal measure on α. If there is a normal ultrafilter on α which contains the measurables, we choose Uα such that A0∈Uα and A2∉Uα. This is possible either by the induction hypothesis or if there is no normal ultrafilter on α such that A2∈Uα at all.

Notice that κ is a limit of compact cardinals, by the assumptions of the theorem. Let V be any normal measure on κ such that A0∈V. If A2∉V then we are done (as A1∈V by virtue of Claim [\ref=ccccom]), so assume A2∈V. We shall elicit a new normal ultrafilter W on κ, as required. For every subset X  ⊆  κ we define:

[formula]

It is easily verified that W is an ultrafilter on κ. Let us show that W is normal. Suppose X∈W and f is a regressive function on X. Denote the set [formula] by SX. It follows from the definition of W that SX∈V. As [formula] is regressive for every α∈SX, there exist a set [formula] and an ordinal γα  <  α so that [formula]. The mapping α  ↦  γα is a regressive function on SX, so (by the normality of V) there is a set S  ⊆  SX,S∈V and a fixed ordianl γ  <  κ such that α∈S  ⇒  γα  =  γ. Let Y be [formula]. By the considerations above, Y∈W (as SY  ⊇  S∈V) and [formula]. It follows that W is normal, as required.

We claim that W satisfies the theorem. Indeed, [formula] for every measurable α in A0 (by the choice of Uα). As A0∈V it means that A2∉W.

On the other hand, [formula] for every supercompact α in A2 (as every supercompact α carries a normal ultrafilter which concentrates on the measurables), hence A0∈W (recall that A2∈V). As κ is a limit of compact cardinals (recall that A2∈V and every supercompact is compact) we conclude from Claim [\ref=ccccom] that A1∈W as well, so we are done.

[formula]

One may wonder if the theorem of Menas can be rephrased for measurables and supercompact cardinals or even for compact and supercompact cardinals. We can infer from the theorem above that if κ is measurable and a limit of supercompact cardinals, then κ need not be a supercompact cardinal (but notice that κ is a compact cardinal). In fact, the amount of measurables, limit of supercompact cardinals, which are not supercompact by themselves, is large in the following sense:

Assume that:

κ is a measurable cardinal.

κ is a limit of supercompact cardinals.

U is a normal ultrafilter on κ.

A0∈U.

Then there exists a normal ultrafilter V on κ such that the set of measurables limit of supercompact cardinals which are not supercompact, belongs to V. Moreover, the members of this set are compact cardinals.

Proof. By Theorem [\ref=mt] we can create V such that A0∈V and A2∉V. Let A'  ⊆  A0 be the set of measurables which are limit of supercompact cardinals. By Lemma [\ref=llll] we know that A'∈V (assumption (b) is used here, and A2 plays the role of T in the lemma).

As A2∉V we know that [formula] Notice that the members of this set are not supercompact although each of them is a limit of supercompact cardinals. By the theorem of Menas, the members of [formula] are compact cardinals. Hence the set [formula] completes the proof of the corollary.

[formula]

However, if there is a normal ultrafilter U on κ so that A2∈U, then the set of supercompact cardinals which are limit of supercompact cardinals belongs to U (by Lemma [\ref=llll]). The existence of U is coherent, of course, with Corollary [\ref=nnnnmenas]. It should be observed that under stronger assumption we can get the following parallel to the theorem of Menas:

Suppose that:

κ is a measurable cardinal.

U is a normal ultrafilter on κ.

A2∈U.

Then κ is supercompact.

Proof. Let γ be any ordinal above κ. We have to show that κ is γ-supercompact, i.e., that there is a fine and normal measure on Pκγ. For every α∈A2 we choose a fine and normal ultrafilter Uα on Pαγ. Now, for every x  ⊆  Pκγ we define:

[formula]

We claim that V is a fine and normal ultrafilter on Pκγ. The fact that V is an ultrafilter is routine. We know that V is normal since it results as a sum of normal ultrafilters over some normal ultrafilter. Let us show that V is fine.

Fix any i∈γ and let Si be the set {x∈Pκγ:i∈x}. We must prove that Si∈V. Observe that [formula]. It follows that [formula] for every α∈A2. This is suffice, as A2∈U.

[formula]

The main theorem above can be rephrased in a more general setting. We shall prove, on the basis of this generalization, that some higher properties are separable:

The generalized separation. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let p,r be two properties such that Ar  ⊆  Ap, and there is a normal ultrafilter V on κ such that Ar∈V. Assume that r(α)  ⇒   there is a normal Uα on α so that Ap∈Uα. Then the properties p and r are separable.

In particular, the properties of measurability and 1-extendibility are separable, as well as the properties 1-extendibility and 2κ-supercompactness.

Proof. Let X be the collection of measurables which carry a normal ultrafilter V so that Ar∈V. We procceed by induction on the members of X. Assume κ∈X, and the theorem holds on the members of X below κ. Fix V on κ so that Ar∈V. We shall define W, another normal ultrafilter on κ, such that Ap∈W yet Ar∉W.

For this end, we choose a sequence of normal ultrafilters 〈Uα:α  <  κ〉 (for every measurable α) as follows. If there is no normal ultrafilter on α which contains Ap then let Uα be any normal ultrafilter. Otherwise, let Uα satisfy [formula]. This is possible by the induction hypothesis.

For every y  ⊆  κ define:

[formula]

As in the main theorem above, W is normal, and [formula], so we are done.

Recall that if κ is 2κ-supercompact then κ carries a normal ultrafilter U which contains the set of 1-extendible cardinals below κ. Inasmuch as every 1-extendible cardinal carries a normal ultrafilter which contains the measurables, we know that measurability and 1-extendibility are separable. Likewise, measurability and 2κ-supercompactness are separable. Hence, one can prove a parallel to Theorem [\ref=mt] with respect to measurability and 2κ-supercompactness.

The same holds for higher notions of large cardinals. For instance, each extendible cardinal carries a normal ultrafilters which contains the supercompact cardinals. It follows that extendibility and supercompactness are separable.

[formula]

The theorems of this section provide some stable distinction between compact and supercompact cardinals. This is natural when the defining criterion is related to normality of ultrafilters. Indeed, the notion of normality plays a central role in the definition of supercompactness, but not in the definitions of measurability or compactness.

Normal measures containing the non-measurables

As mentioned in the previous section, Solovay proved that each measurable cardinal κ carries a normal measure which contains the non-measurables below κ. Clearly, there is no parallel theorem for normal measures which concentrate on the measurables. If κ is the first measurable (or any measurable cardinal which is not a limit of measurable cardinals) then the set of measurables below κ cannot be a member of a normal ultrafilter.

Nonetheless, if we assume more than measurability then we have normal ultrafilters containing the measurables. It suffices that κ is 2κ-supercompact to prove the existence of such an ultrafilter. Moreover, there are many distinct normal ultrafilters on κ which concentrate on the measurables if we assume enough supercompactness.

Despite that fact, we do not know if there are two distinct normal ultrafilters on κ which contain the non-measurables. This is labeled as an open problem in [\cite=MR1994835]. It seems that separability properties below the notion of measurability cannot be established, so a direct approach for creating two distinct normal ultrafilters fails. The essential obstacle is that weak properties (namely, weaker than measurability) can hardly be separated in the sense of Theorem [\ref=gggg]. We cannot assume that r(α)  ⇒   there is a normal Uα on α so that Ap∈Uα, since there is no normal ultrafilter on α at all if the property r is weaker than measurability.

Moreover, it may happen that the normal ultrafilter ensured by Theorem [\ref=sssolovay] of Solovay is the only normal ultrafilter on κ (see [\cite=MR0277346]). If so, there are no two distinct normal ultrafilters (on κ) containing the non-measurables. Nevertheless, separability can be invoked in a slight different manner. In order to use separability for producing two distinct normal ultrafilters which do not contain the measurable cardinals, we shall act as follows.

In the theorems below we shall see that separating properties above measurability enable us to create distinct normal ultrafilters which contain the non-measurables (but we do not resolve the above open problem). Let κ be a measurbale cardinal, and for every measurable α  <  κ choose a normal ultrafilter Uα which does not contain the measurables. We shall try to define sums of the same sequence 〈Uα:α  <  κ〉 over distinct normal ultrafilters on κ which contain the measurables. Unfortunately, there is no reason that this process will be one-to-one, but separating properties may help:

Ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let p,q be two properties that are separable on κ. Let Uα be a normal ultrafilter on α which does not contain the measurables, for every measurable α  <  κ, and let SX be [formula] for every X  ⊆  κ. If there is X  ⊆  κ so that [formula], then there are (at least) two distinct normal ultrafilters on κ which do not contain the measurables.

Proof. Let {Vγ:γ  <  γ*} be the set of all normal ultrafilters on κ which contain the measurables. Let D be [formula]. Observe that D is a normal filter (as an intersection of normal filters) but not an ultrafilter (unless γ* = 1). Denote the complement ideal by I.

We claim that if there is a subset X  ⊆  κ such that [formula] then we are done. Indeed, if such an X exists, then we may find two distinct ultrafilters V0,V1 so that SX∈V0 and SX∉V1. We define W0,W1 as usual, namely [formula] for [formula]. It follows that each [formula] is a normal ultrafilter which do not contain the measurables (as every Uα runs away from the measurables, and the set of α-s belongs to [formula]). Moreover, W0  ≠  W1, as demonstrated by X. Indeed, X∈W0 as SX∈V0, but X∉W1 as SX∉V1.

Now choose X  ⊆  κ so that [formula]. Let V0,V1 be normal ultrafilters on κ such that [formula] and Ap,Aq∈V1. This can be done by the assumptions of the Theorem. It follows that SX∉V1 (as Aq∈V1) and SX∈V0, so we are done.

[formula]

The opposite direction holds as well. If 〈Uα:α  <  κ〉 is fixed, V0  ≠  V1 are normal ultrafilters on κ which contain the measurables, W0,W1 are the sums of 〈Uα:α  <  κ〉 over V0,V1 and W0  ≠  W1, then there exists X  ⊆  κ such that [formula].

[formula]

Based on Theorem [\ref=aaaa], we shall introduce a theorem about normal ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables. The idea is to use the definition of Anti-Limit-Condition (ALC, to be defined below). The strong version of this notion yields distinct ultrafilters in ZFC, and we indicate that the weaker version enables us to force the existence of distinct normal measures on κ (which do not contain the measurables) whenever κ is supercompact. The method is to procure a subset X  ⊆  κ so that SX belongs to one normal ultrafilter on κ but not to some other such ultrafilter.

The Anti-Limit-Condition.

Let α be a measurable cardinal, limit of measurable cardinals. Let [formula] is a measurable cardinal〉 be a sequence of normal ultrafilters, each Uβ is defined on the measurable cardinal β. We say that 〈Uβ:β  ≤  α〉 has the ALC if one can find a sequence of sets 〈Xβ:β  <  α〉 such that Xβ∈Uβ for every β  <  α but [formula].

Let κ be a measurable cardinal, T1 an unbounded subset of κ which is a set of measurable cardinals and T = {α:α is a measurable cardinal limit of members from T1}. We say that κ satisfies the ALC with respect to T1 if there is a sequence [formula] of normal ultrafilters (each Uβ is defined on the measurable cardinal β) such that the sequence 〈Uβ:β  ≤  α〉 has the ALC whenever α∈T.

Let κ be a measurable cardinal, T1 an unbounded subset of κ which is a set of measurable cardinals and T = {α:α is a measurable cardinal limit of members from T1}. We say that κ satisfies the uniform ALC with respect to T1 if it satisfies the ALC with respect to T1 (as exemplified by [formula]) and one can choose 〈Xβ:β  <  κ〉 such that Xβ∈Uβ for every [formula], and [formula] whenever α∈T.

Part (a) defines a property of the sequence of ultrafilters. Part (b) deals with a property of the measurable κ itself, demanding that the property of part (a) holds for every measurable cardinal limit of measurable cardinals (in the set T) below κ. The extra requirement in part (c) is that the sets in the ultrafilters are taken from some fixed sequence of sets, while in part (b) we may change them for every specific α.

[formula]

The uniform ALC property (of part (c)) provides the tools for the construction of two distinct ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables in ZFC, as follows:

Uniform ALC and distinct normal measures. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, satisfies the uniform ALC. Suppose T0,T1 are separable for κ, T0  ⊆  T1 and both consist of measurable cardinals. Then one can elicit two distinct normal ultrafilters on κ which do not contain the measurable cardinlas below κ, by summing over a fixed sequence of ultrafilters.

Proof. Set T = {α:α is a measurable cardinal, limit of members from T1}. Let [formula] exemplify the uniform ALC on κ with respect to T1. We compute SX according to this sequence, i.e., [formula] for every X  ⊆  κ. Choose a sequence [formula] as in Definition [\ref=aallcc](c). Define:

[formula]

We claim that SX = T1. For this, consider an ordinal β∈T1. If follows (from the very definition of the set X) that [formula]. As Xβ∈Uβ we have [formula], hence β∈SX. On the other hand, if β∉T1 then we may assume (without loss of generality) that β∈T (notice that we ignore measurable cardinals outside [formula], as this set is negligible). By the ALC we know that [formula], so β∉SX. Now by virtue of Theorem [\ref=aaaa] we are done.

[formula]

Essentially, the same idea may be rendered in order to force the existence of distinct normal ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables. We have to assume merely ALC (i.e., part (b) of Definition [\ref=aallcc]). Suppose κ is a supercompact cardinal. By the preparatory forcing of Laver (see [\cite=MR0472529]) we may assume that κ is indestructible.

We begin with two distinct normal ultrafilters V0,V1 which contain the measurables, and separate the properties T0,T1. Now we can employ the so-called generalized Mathias forcing (see [\cite=MR2927607], for an explicit description of it) to force the existence of a pair (s,x) so that s  ⊆  Sx  ⊆  T1. If we use V0,V1 for summing over a fixed sequence of normal ultrafilters which satisfies [\ref=aallcc](b), we produce W0,W1 as required (i.e., normal ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables such that x∈W1 yet x∉W0).

Anyway, as Saharon Shelah indicated, much simpler arguments may be invoked in order to force distinct normal ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables. It means that the original problem is interesting only in the frame of ZFC.

The existence of two distinct normal ultrafilters which do not contain the measurables need not come from summing over normal ultrafilters which concentrate on the measurables. By Kunen-paris (see [\cite=MR0277381]) one can force the existence of many normal ultrafilters on the first measurable cardinal. All of them do not contain the measurabels, but none of them comes from the process described in the theorems of this paper.
