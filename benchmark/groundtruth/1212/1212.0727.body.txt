Reconstruction from boundary measurements for less regular conductivities

Introduction

Let [formula] be an open, bounded domain and let γ be a strictly positive real valued function defined on Ω which gives the conductivity at a given point. Given a voltage potential f on the boundary, the equation for the potential in the interior, under the assumption of no sinks or sources of current in Ω, is

[formula]

The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is defined in this case as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] is the outward normal derivative at the boundary. For γ∈L∞(Ω) and being the boundary of Ω Lipschitz, then Λγ is a well defined map from [formula] to [formula].

The Calderón problem concerns the inversion of the map γ  →  Λγ, i.e., whether Λγ determines γ uniquely and in that case how to reconstruct γ from Λγ.

For the boundary determination: if ∂Ω is C∞ and γ∈C∞(), Kohn and Vogelius [\cite=KV1] showed that Λγ determines [formula] for all k  ≥  0; if ∂Ω is Lipschitz and γ∈Lip(Ω), Brown [\cite=Bro1] showed that [formula] can be recovered from the knowledge of Λγ; if ∂Ω is C1 and γ∈C1(), Nakamura and Tanuma [\cite=NT1] showed that [formula] can be recovered from Λγ. Now, being γ∈C1() and for Ω Lipschitz domain, the authors and Brown together show the recovering of the gradient of the conductivity at the boundary (see Appendix).

For the higher dimensional problem (n  ≥  3), uniqueness was first proven for piecewise analytic conductivities by Kohn and Vogelius [\cite=KV2]. Later, Sylvester and Uhlmann showed that the uniqueness holds for smooth conductivities in their fundamental paper [\cite=SU1] which opened the door for studying the Calderón problem. Generalization to less regular conductivities had been obtained by several authors. Brown [\cite=B1] obtained uniqueness under the assumption of [formula] derivatives. Päivärinta, Panchenko and Uhlmann [\cite=PPU1] proved uniqueness under the assumption of [formula] bounded derivatives. Brown and Torres [\cite=BT1] obtained uniqueness under the assumption of [formula] derivatives being in Lp,p > 2n. Later, Uhlmann [\cite=Uhl1] proposed a conjecture whether uniqueness holds in dimension n  ≥  3 for Lipschitz or less regular conductivities.

Recently, Haberman and Tataru [\cite=HT1] gave a partial answer to this conjecture. They used a totally new idea to construct CGO solutions in Bourgain's space and showed uniqueness for C1 conductivity γ or Lipchitz conductivity γ with small enough value of [formula]. The ideas and techniques coming from this work have been widely used as can be seen in the papers by Zhang [\cite=Z], Caro, Garca and Reyes [\cite=CGR] or Caro and Zhou [\cite=CZ].

If uniqueness holds, one whether or not construct the conductivity in the domain Ω by the boundary measurements. Nachman [\cite=Na1] and Novikov [\cite=Nov1] independently solved this problem for C2 conductivity.

We will briefly describe Nachman's idea as follows. For γ∈C2(), if u is a solution to [\eqref=0.1], Sylvester and Uhlmann reduced [formula] to satisfy

[formula]

where [formula], and the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann map Λq to [\eqref=0.2] is determined by Λγ. For [formula] and [formula], Sylvester and Uhlmann constructed a family of CGO solutions v(n) = ex  ·  ρ(n)1(1 + Φ(n)1(x)) to

[formula]

with the remainder term Φ(n)1(x) decaying to zero in some sense as |ρ(n)1|  →    ∞  , where [formula] in Ω and q = 0 outside Ω.

For the appropriate chosen [formula] and ρ(n)1  +  ρ(n)2 = ik, Green's formula gives us

[formula]

where

[formula]

Letting n  →    ∞   in [\eqref=0.4] we conclude from the decay property of Φ(n)1(x)

[formula]

so the problem is then to recover the boundary values [formula].

On the othe hand, v(n) is a solution to the exterior problem:

[formula]

If v(n) satisfies the radiation condition

[formula]

using Green's formula in [\eqref=eq:0.5] we can reduce fρ(n)1 to satisfy a boundary integral equation

[formula]

and [\eqref=0.7] is uniquely solvable by Fredholm alternative theory, where [formula] are defined in Section 3.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to directly check that v(n) satisfy [\eqref=0.6]. To move around this obstacle, Nachman [\cite=Na1] dealt with this problem in an inverse direction: He first constructed CGO solutions to [\eqref=0.3] automatically satisfying the radial condition [\eqref=0.6] from boundary integral equation [\eqref=0.7] and then showed that these solutions are the same as the solutions obtained by Sylvester and Uhlmann[\cite=SU1].

For γ∈C1() or γ∈Lip(Ω) with the small enough value of [formula] we will follow Nachman's idea to construct CGO solutions to the equation

[formula]

from the boundary integral equation [\eqref=0.7]. In view of the less smooth regular γ, we need to do some changes in the above steps. First we reduce conductivity γ to the case [formula] near the boundary of BR(0)  ⊃  Ω and show that the new Dirichlet-to-Neumann map Λ̃γ corresponding to γ in BR(0) is determined by Λγ. Next we construct CGO solutions to [\eqref=0.8] from the boundary integral equation [\eqref=0.7] on the boundary ∂BR(0) and show that these solutions are the same as the solutions obtained by Haberman and Tataru [\cite=HT1].

We state the theorem as follows.

The conductivity γ can be recovered in the domain Ω by the knowledge of Λγ under one of the following assumptions: (a) Let [formula] be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and let γ(x)∈C1() be a real valued function with γ(x)  ≥  C0 > 0. (b)  Let [formula] be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and let γ(x)∈Lip(Ω) be a real valued function with γ(x)  ≥  C0 > 0 and such that there exists a constant εn,Ω satisfying [formula].

Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we reduce the conductivity γ to be [formula] near the boundary. In Section 3 we construct CGO solutions from the boundary integral equation. In Section 4 we state the reconstruction of the conductivity γ from Λγ. In the appendix the authors and R. M. Brown give the proof of the recovering of the gradient of a C1-conductivity at the boundary of a Lipschitz domain.

Reduction to The Case [formula] near The Boundary

For a bounded domain Ω with Lipschitz boundary and γ∈Lip(Ω), if Λγ is known, we can recover the values of γ at the boundary ∂Ω (see [\cite=Bro1] ). From this knowledge we can extend γ to be a Lipchitz function in [formula] with [formula] outside a large ball BR0 and γ(x)  ≥  C0  >  0. Furthermore, If [formula] we can keep this property holding in [formula]. For a bounded Lipschitz domain Ω and γ∈C1(), if Λγ is known, we can recover the values of γ and the gradient of γ at the boundary ∂Ω (see the appendix). Next, Whitney's extension allows us from the information of ∂αγ(x) for all x∈∂Ω and all |α|  ≤  1 to extend γ to be C1 in [formula] with [formula] outside a large ball BR0 and γ(x)  ≥  C0  >  0(The readers are referred to see Chapter VI .7 of [\cite=St]). In the above two cases obviously γ is known in [formula].

Now for fixed R > R0 such that Ω  ⊂  BR(0), we define the new Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as follows:

[formula]

where uf is a solution to

[formula]

In the following, we will show Λ̃γ is determined by Λγ and the value of γ in [formula]. Here we need to mention that Nachman already used this idea in [\cite=Na2] and obtained an exact formula in the plane with the the conductivity γ∈W2,p,p > 1 (see Proposition 6.1 of [\cite=Na2]). Following Nachman's idea, we will generalize this formula in a bounded Lipchitz domain [formula] for a Lipchitz conductivity γ.

In fact, if we denote by Ω1, respectively Ω2, the domains Ω and BR(0), and by ∂Ω1, respectively ∂Ω2, the boundary of Ω and the boundary of BR(0), the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map corresponding to γ in the domain [formula] can be viewed as [formula] matrix of operators [formula] defined as follows. Given fj∈H1(∂Ωj) for j = 1,2., considering the Dirichlet problem

[formula]

we have the following Dirichlet-to Neumann map:H1(∂Ωj)  →  L2(∂Ωj) as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the nontangential limit of [formula] from outside of 1 and [formula] denotes the nontangential limit of [formula] from inside of Ω2. Since γ is known in [formula], Λij,i,j = 1,2., are determined. Now for any f∈H1(∂Ω2) we have a solution [formula], where 0  ≤  s < 2, satisfying

[formula]

Let [formula]. We have that [\eqref=1.1] implies

[formula]

If g can be recovered from [formula], then Λ̃γ is known. On the other hand, in view of [formula] we can deduce from [\eqref=1.1]

[formula]

Hence, it follows that

[formula]

If we can show that ( - Λγ  -  Λ11) is an invertible operator: H1(∂Ω1)  →  L2(∂Ω1), then we have

[formula]

Finally [\eqref=1.2] and [\eqref=1.3] imply

[formula]

Now we state the generalized result of Nachman [\cite=Na2] as follows.

Let 1  ⊂  Ω2 be a bounded Lipschitz domain in [formula] and let γ(x)∈Lip(Ω2) with γ(x)  ≥  C0 > 0. Then ( - Λγ  -  Λ11) is an invertible operator: H1(∂Ω1)  →  L2(∂Ω1) and Λ̃γ  =  Λ21( - Λγ  -  Λ11)- 1Λ12  +  Λ22.

Before proving Theorem [\ref=t1.1], we first introduce some known results. Let G(x,y) be the Green function such that, for x∈Ω2,

[formula]

Now we define the single layer potential and double layer potential as

[formula]

[formula]

For the single potential Sf(x) and the double layer potential Df(x), we collect the following results from Mitrea and Taylor's paper [\cite=MT1] (see Proposition 1.6, Theorem 3.7, Proposition 3.8 and Proposition 8.2 of [\cite=MT1]).

If Ω1 is a bounded Lipschitz domain in [formula] and f∈L2(∂Ω1), then the functions Sf(x) and Df(x) have the following properties:

(a) The following estimates hold

[formula]

[formula]

(b)  [formula].

(c) Sf(x)∈H1(Ω2  -  1) and Sf(x)∈H1(Ω1). The boundary value Sf+(x)(Sf-(x)) of Sf(x) from outside (respectively inside) Ω1 are identical as elements of H1(∂Ω1) and agree with [formula].

(d) The (nontangential) limits [formula] as the boundary is approached from outside (respectively inside) Ω1 are given by the formula

[formula]

where

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

(e) The nontangential limits Df+(x)(Df-(x)) of Df(x) as we approach the boundary from outside (respectively inside) Ω1 exist and satisfy

[formula]

where

[formula]

Our case is a little bit different from the case of the paper [\cite=MT1]. In [\cite=MT1] they dealt with the operator [formula] in a compact, connected smooth M with C1 metric tensor. But if we just want to get the above Proposition [\ref=p1.2], we can reproduce the steps of the proof of Theorem 3.7 and Proposition 3.8 to show that the above Proposition [\ref=p1.2] still holds for the operator [formula] in a bounded domain in Ω2 with Lipchitz conductivity γ.

We know that the Dirichlet-to Neumann map Λγ is a bounded operator:[formula]. In fact, when Ω1 is a bounded Lipschitz domain and γ(x)∈Lip(Ω1), the Dirichlet-to Neumann map Λγ is a bounded operator :H1(∂Ω1)  →  L2(∂Ω1)(the same argument for Λ̃γ,Λi,j,i,j = 1,2.). This result follows from the following Proposition [\ref=p1.3] and Proposition [\ref=p1.3] can be deduced from Proposition 7.4 and Proposition 8.2 of the paper [\cite=MT1].

Suppose Ω is a bounded domain in [formula] with Lipchitz boundary and γ(x)∈Lip(Ω) with γ(x)  ≥  C0 > 0. Let u(x)∈H1(Ω) be a solution to

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is the nontangential maximal fuction of [formula].

With the above preliminary works in hand we are now in the position to show an identity about Λγ  +  Λ11.

For any g∈H1(∂Ω1), we have the identity

[formula]

For any g∈H1(∂Ω1) we can find a solution [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Since γ(x)∈Lip(Ω2) the local regularity of the uniformly elliptic equation implies that [formula] and Proposition [\ref=p1.3] implies that [formula]. Therefore we can still use Green's formula for [formula],

[formula]

Since G(x,y) = 0,y∈∂Ω2 and [formula], [\eqref=1.8] implies

[formula]

Let x  →  ∂Ω1 in [\eqref=1.9] and Proposition [\ref=p1.2] implies

[formula]

On the other hand we can find a solution u to

[formula]

Using Green's formula again we know for x∈Ω1

[formula]

Let x  →  ∂Ω1 in [\eqref=1.11] and Proposition [\ref=p1.2] gives

[formula]

Finally [\eqref=1.10] +   [\eqref=1.12] imply

[formula]

which means

[formula]

At last we need to point out that the above proof is just a formal deduction due to the singularity of [formula]. To overcome this obstacle we can deal with the integrations in a domain in which we remove a small ball Bε(x) centered at the singular point x. Finally letting ε  →  0 we get the above identity.

Now we will show that Λγ  +  Λ11 is an invertible operator: H1(∂Ω1)  →  L2(∂Ω1). From this Theorem [\ref=t1.1] follows.

Λγ  +  Λ11 is an invertible operator: H1(∂Ω1)  →  L2(∂Ω1) and the invertible operator is [formula] for any f∈L2(∂Ω1).

We first show that [formula] is an isomorphism from L2(∂Ω1) to H1(∂Ω1). In fact Lemma [\ref=l1.5] implies [formula] is surjective. To show that [formula] is injective we assume that [formula] on ∂Ω1 for f∈L2(∂Ω1). By Proposition [\ref=1.2] we know Sf(x) is a solution to [formula] in Ω1 and Sf-(x) = 0 on the boundary ∂Ω1. Hence the maximum principle of the uniformly elliptic equation implies [formula] in 1. On the other hand Sf(x) is also a solution to [formula] in [formula]. In view of the choice G(x,y) = 0,x∈∂Ω2, we know [formula] and Proposition [\ref=1.2] implies Sf+(x) = 0 on the boundary ∂Ω1, so the maximum principle of the uniformly elliptic equation also implies [formula] in [formula].

From the analysis above we know that [formula] in Ω2. By Proposition [\ref=1.2], we have

[formula]

which implies [formula] on the boundary ∂Ω1. Thus [formula] is bijective and Proposition [\ref=1.2] implies [formula] is a bounded operator:L2(∂Ω1)  →  H1(∂Ω1). Finally Banach inverse mapping theorem gives us [formula] is an isomorphism which L2(∂Ω1) to H1(∂Ω1).

On the other hand, from Lemma [\ref=l1.5]'s identity [formula], bijection of [formula] implies Λγ  +  Λ11 is also bijective and from Proposition [\ref=p1.3] we have that Λγ  +  Λ11 is a bounded operator: H1(∂Ω1)  →  L2(∂Ω1). Banach inverse mapping theorem implies [formula].

Construction of CGO Solutions from the Boundary Integral Equation

In this section we will follow Nachman's idea to construct Complex Geometrical Optic solutions to the equation [formula] from the boundary integral equation. We begin with some basic properties of Green's function. For [formula] with ρ  ·  ρ = 0, ( - ξ2 + 2iρ  ·  ξ)- 1 is easily checked to be locally integrable as a function of ξ in [formula]. Its inverse Fourier transform formally written as

[formula]

is a tempered distribution satisfying

[formula]

The distribution Gρ(x) =  - ex  ·  ρg(x,ρ) is then a fundamental solution for the Laplace operator in [formula]:

[formula]

It follows that Gρ(x) differs from the Green's function of classical potential theory by a global harmonic function in [formula]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that Gρ(x) is a smooth function for x away from the origin and has the same singularity near x = 0 as that of G0(x).

Using the family Gρ of Green's function defined above we now consider analogues of the classical single and double potentials. Let

[formula]

[formula]

where Gρ(x,y) = :Gρ(x - y) and to begin with, f is continuous on ∂Ω and [formula]. Define the boundary, or trace , double layer potential by

[formula]

Now we collect some properties about single and double layer potentials from Nachman's paper [\cite=Na1] as follows (see Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.5 of [\cite=Na1]).

Let Ω be a bounded domain in [formula] with C1,1 boundary and suppose [formula]. Then the function u = Sρf have the following properties:

(a) [formula] in [formula].

(b) u is in H2(Ω) and in H2(Ω'θ) for θ  >  θ0, where θ0 is a large enough number so that   ⊂  {x: |x| < θ0}, and for any θ  >  θ0, Ω'θ  =  {x: x∉,|x| < θ}.

(c)The boundary values u+(u-) of u from outside (respectively inside) Ω are identical as elements of [formula] and agree with the trace of single layer potential Sρf.

(d)  u satisfies the following decay properties:

[formula]

(e) Let [formula] and v = Dρg defined in [formula]. Then the nontangential limits v+(v-) of v as we approach the boundary from outside (respectively inside) Ω exist and satisfy

[formula]

With the above preliminary works in hand we first deduce a boundary integral equation for the CGO solutions.

From the analysis we performed in Section 2 we can assume Ω = BR(0) and [formula] near the boundary ∂BR(0) and for [formula] define the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as follows

[formula]

where uf is the solution to

[formula]

Clearly Λγ is a bounded operator: [formula].

We are now ready to establish a one to one correspondence between the solutions of the boundary integral equation and those of the following exterior problem:

[formula]

We state Lemma 2.7 of Nachman's paper [\cite=Na1] as follows.

(a) Suppose ψ solves [formula]. Then its trace on the boundary [formula] solves

[formula]

(b) Conversely, suppose [formula] solves [\eqref=3.3]. Then the function ψ(x,ρ) defined for x in [formula] by

[formula]

solves the exterior problem [\eqref=3.2](i),(ii),(iii),(iv). Furthermore [formula].

In the following we will use the boundary integral equation [\eqref=3.3] to construct CGO solutions to [formula] in [formula].

Suppose [formula] solves [\eqref=3.3]. Then

(a) There exists a unique solution [formula] to

[formula]

in [formula] such that u = ψ(x,ρ) in [formula].

(b) Let [formula] and [formula] is a weak solution to the following Schrödinger equation where [formula]. Furthermore the following identity holds

[formula]

(c) Let v(x) = ex  ·  ρ(1 + Φ(x,ρ)). Then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

as a tempered distribution.

For [formula] we can find a solution w∈H2(BR(0)) such that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=p3.2] implies [formula] and [formula]. Hence defining

[formula]

we know [formula] is a solution to

[formula]

The uniqueness follows from the maximum principle of the uniformly elliptic equation. Then (a) follows.

Letting [formula] in view of [formula] in [formula], we can deduce from [\eqref=3.5] that [formula] is a weak solution to

[formula]

where [formula].

For any R' > R and δ > 0 small enough, we can consider a Lipschitz function hδ(t) given by

[formula]

and then define the function Hδ(x) = hδ(|x|)∈Lip(BR'(0)),x∈R'(0). Clearly, we have

[formula]

Given ε > 0 we define the following regularized version of Gρ(x,y) by

[formula]

Taking the test function Hδ(y)Gερ(x,y)∈H10(BR(0)) in [\eqref=3.8], we have

[formula]

On the other hand since [formula] and [formula] Green's formula gives us

[formula]

where [formula]

Now from [\eqref=3.10]+  [\eqref=3.11] we have

[formula]

Note that the left hand side of [\eqref=3.12] can be rewritten as follows

[formula]

Letting [formula] Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem implies

[formula]

On the other hand in view of [formula] and [formula] in [formula], when δ < R - R0 we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=3.12], [\eqref=3.13], [\eqref=3.14] and [\eqref=3.15], we deduce that

[formula]

For I we have

[formula]

For V by letting [formula] Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem implies

[formula]

In view of [formula] and [formula] integration by parts gives us

[formula]

Since [formula] and Gερ(x,y) is smooth, letting δ  →  0 in [\eqref=3.19] we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=3.12], [\eqref=3.17], [\eqref=3.18] and [\eqref=3.20], we have

[formula]

and from [\eqref=3.12], [\eqref=3.16] and [\eqref=3.21] we derive

[formula]

On the other hand, Green's formula gives us

[formula]

From [\eqref=3.22] and [\eqref=3.23], we deduce

[formula]

Due to [formula] and v = γ1 / 2u, letting ε  →  0 in [\eqref=3.24] we have for almost every x∈BR'(0)

[formula]

where we have used that [formula] is an approximation of identity and Lp estimate of the convolution type integration about the kernels of G0(x - y) and [formula].

In view of [formula] and [formula] whenever  ρ  ·  ρ = 0, we deduce from Green's formula

[formula]

Since u = ψ(x,ρ) in [formula] and Proposition [\ref=3.2] implies that u - ex  ·  ρ satisfies [\eqref=3.1], we can deduce from [\eqref=3.26]

[formula]

Then [\eqref=3.25] and [\eqref=3.27] imply

[formula]

Then (b) follows.

Let [formula], where Jε is the standard mollifier. Since [formula] and [formula] in [formula], by integration by parts we can deduce from [\eqref=3.28]

[formula]

Recalling v(x) = ex  ·  ρ(1 + Φ(x,ρ)) we can deduce from [\eqref=3.29]

[formula]

where we have used the relations Gρ(x,y) = Gρ(x - y), gρ(x,y) = gρ(x - y) and gρ(x) =  - ex  ·  ρGρ(x).

Hence, we conclude from [\eqref=3.30] that

[formula]

as a tempered distribution.

In fact,

[formula]

and

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula] in [formula] and [formula] from the results of the paper of [\cite=HT1], we know [\eqref=3.31], [\eqref=3.32] and [\eqref=3.33] all make sense. Then (c) follows.

In Lemma [\ref=l3.3], we proved the identity [\eqref=3.7]. We mentioned that [formula] and [formula] are tempered distributions. In fact in the paper [\cite=HT1] by Habermann and Tataru, they showed [formula] and [formula] [formula]. We are now in the position to introduce the definition of Bourgain's space [formula] (see [\cite=Bou]). Following the idea of Haberman and Tataru we define the space [formula] by the norm

[formula]

where pρ(ξ) =  - |ξ|2 + 2iρ  ·  ξ is the symbol of [formula].

Now given [formula], consider P a 2-dimensional linear subpace orthogonal to k and set

[formula]

[formula]

where η1,η2∈Sn - 1 satisfy (k,η1) = (k,η2) = (η1,η2) = 0 and [formula]. We have that η1 can be chosen to be [formula] (for later references set [formula]) and η2 is the unique vector making {η1,η2} a positively oriented orthonormal basis of P. The vectors are chosen so that ρi  ·  ρi = 0,i = 1,2. and ρ1  +  ρ2 = ik.

We can prove the following result.

Let γ(x)∈Lip(BR(0)) be a real valued function and assume that γ(x)  ≥  C0 > 0 with [formula] near the boundary ∂BR(0) . Then there exists a constant εn,R such that if γ satisfies either [formula] or γ∈C1(R(0)), then the following properties hold

(a) [formula] is a compact operator on [formula].

(b) For any [formula], when |ρ| is large enough, then there exists a unique [formula] such that

[formula]

(c) Let us consider ρi  =  ρi(s,η1) as above. We have that u = γ- 1 / 2ex  ·  ρi(1 + Φ(x,ρi)) are solutions to Moreover, for a fixed [formula] and P as above we have that for sufficiently large λ,

[formula]

[formula]

where ηB is a smooth function with compact support.

For (a) let [formula] and consider u∈H2(BR(0)) solution to

[formula]

Let x∈Ω and apply Green's formula to Gερ(x,y) in Ω. After taking the limit as ε tends to zero we obtain

[formula]

Letting x  →  ∂BR(0) (nontangential from inside BR(0) ), we deduce from Proposition [\ref=p3.1]

[formula]

where T denotes the trace operator.

Since γ∈Lip(BR(0)) from the estimates of the uniformly elliptic equation we know that the operator [formula] is bounded. Furthermore Rellich's compact embedding theorem implies that the operator [formula] is compact and Calderón-Zygmund estimates imply that the operator Gρ:f∈L2(BR(0)  →  Gρf∈H2(BR(0)) is bounded. On the other hand, the trace operator [formula] is bounded. Summing up the above analysis we can deduce from [\eqref=3.34] that [formula] is a compact operator on [formula]. Then (a) follows.

To prove (b) by Fredholm alternative theorem we just need to show that the homogeneous equation

[formula]

only has the zero solution. For any [formula] satisfying [\eqref=3.35] repeating the steps of the proof of Lemma [\ref=l3.3] we can find a solution [formula] to

[formula]

with u|∂BR(0) = g and

[formula]

Noting [formula] and [formula] with compact support, by dual method we can show

[formula]

Then [\eqref=3.36] and [\eqref=3.37] imply [formula].

Under our assumptions: γ∈Lip(BR(0)) and [formula] or γ∈C1(R(0)), when ρ is large enough Haberman and Tataru [\cite=HT1] showed the operator :

[formula]

is a contraction. Therefore it follows from [\eqref=3.36] that [formula]. Hence [formula] and [formula]. Then (b) follows.

In view of (b), for any [formula], when |ρ| is large enough, then there exists a unique [formula] such that

[formula]

Now Lemma [\ref=l3.3] implies that u(x) = γ- 1 / 2ex  ·  ρ(1 + Φ(x,ρ)) is a solution to and

[formula]

Finally from [\eqref=3.38] under our assumptions about γ, Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=HT1] imply that (c) follows.

Reconstruction of the Conductivity γ

Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=t3.4] γ can be recovered from the knowledge of Λγ at the boundary ∂BR(0).

Before proving Theorem [\ref=t4.1] we first recall an integral identity appearing in Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=Knu].

Suppose γi∈C1(),i = 1,2. and u1,u2∈H1(Ω) satisfy [formula] in Ω. Suppose further that 1∈H1(Ω) satisfies [formula] with 1 = u2 on ∂Ω. Then

[formula]

where the integral on the boundary is understood in the sense of the dual pairing between [formula] and [formula].

Proposition [\ref=p4.2] also holds for γi∈Lip(Ω).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t4.1]

Taking the conductivities γ1  =  γ and γ2 = 1, ρ1 and ρ2 as in [\eqref=ro1] and [\eqref=ro2] respectively and the solutions u1  =  γ- 1 / 2ex  ·  ρ1(1 + Φ(x,ρ1)) and u2 = ex  ·  ρ2 in Proposition [\ref=p4.2], we have

[formula]

We have that [formula] is a solution of the exterior problem [\eqref=3.2] such that [formula]. Since [formula], Sρ1, Bρ1 are known and Λγ and γ at ∂BR(0) can be determined, Proposition [\ref=p3.2] and (b) of Theorem [\ref=t3.4] imply that the right hand side of [\eqref=4.1] is known. Since we have that ρ1  +  ρ2 = ik we deduce from [\eqref=4.1]

[formula]

Let γε be as in Lemma [\ref=l3.3]. Now integration by parts in the left hand side of [\eqref=4.2] gives us

[formula]

Clearly we have

[formula]

in the sense of the tempered distribution.

Since [formula] as ε  →  0 it holds

[formula]

where 〈  〉 means the dual pairing between [formula] and [formula] and [formula] with [formula] in BR(0). Therefore, we have from [\eqref=4.3], [\eqref=4.4] and [\eqref=4.5] that the following holds

[formula]

For a fixed [formula] and λ  ≥  |k|, we next take average of the last identity in (s,η1)∈[λ,2λ]  ×  S. We get that

[formula]

By (c) of Theorem [\ref=t3.4] in Section 3 we have that

[formula]

as λ  →    ∞  . Since the right hand side of [\eqref=average] is still known and (k) does not depend neither on s nor on η1, we have that (k) is known as a tempered distribution. By inverting the Fourier transform the potential q(x) can be recovered in [formula]. From the definition of [formula] we know [formula] is a weak solution to

[formula]

The nonlinear Dirichlet problem [\eqref=4.7] has a unique solution by the maximum principle of uniform elliptic equations and since we have already recovered q(x) we may construct γ in BR(0) by solving the equation [\eqref=4.7]. In other words γ can be recovered by the knowledge of Λγ at the boundary ∂BR(0). Then Theorem [\ref=t4.1] follows.

Appendix.

The goal of this appendix is to give a method for recovering the gradient of a coefficient from the Dirichlet to Neumann map. The argument is an extension of a method from earlier work of Brown [\cite=Bro1].

Throughout this appendix, we let Ω be a Lipschitz domain as defined in [\cite=Ve1], for example, and we let γ denote a function on [formula] that is continuous and satisfies the ellipticity condition for some λ > 0,

[formula]

We will use Hs to denote the standard scale of L2 Sobolev spaces. Given f∈H1 / 2(∂Ω), we may solve the Dirichlet problem

[formula]

We define γ∂u  /  ∂ν, the co-normal derivative of u, as an element of H- 1 / 2(∂Ω) by

[formula]

Here, [formula] is the bilinear pairing of duality and we use φ to denote both a function in H1 / 2(∂Ω) and an extension into Ω which lies in H1(Ω). Because u is a solution, the right-hand side depends only on the boundary values and not on the particular extension chosen for φ.

We give a reformulation of a result of the author Brown for recovering the conductivity at the boundary [\cite=Bro1].

Let Ω be a Lipschitz domain. For almost every x∈∂Ω, we may find a sequence of functions fN which are Lipschitz on ∂Ω, supported in {y:|x - y|  <  N - 1 / 2}, satisfy

[formula]

and so that if γ is a continuous function satisfying ([\ref=Elliptic]), and uN is the solution of the Dirichlet problem for [formula] with data fN, and ψ is a continuous function in [formula], we have

[formula]

As an immediate consequence of the above theorem, we obtain recovery at the boundary and a stability result. The stability result for the recovery of the boundary values of a continuous coefficient in smooth domains was proved by Sylvester and Uhlmann [\cite=SU2].

Let γ be continuous function in [formula] and let x∈∂Ω and fN be as in Theorem [\ref=Brown], then we have

[formula]

As a consequence, we obtain the stability result: If γ and γ̃ are continuous on [formula] and elliptic, then

[formula]

This follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=Brown].

If γ is continuously differentiable in the closure of Ω, we have additional regularity of the solution uN. Since the boundary values fN lie in L2,1(∂Ω), we have that the full gradient of uN lies in L2(∂Ω) and we obtain estimates for the non-tangential maximal function of the gradient [formula]

[formula]

This result holds for elliptic operators in Lipschitz domains with C1 coefficients and follows from the work of Mitrea and Taylor on manifolds with C1-metrics [\cite=MT1]. We will use the estimate ([\ref=NTEstimates]) to justify the use of the divergence theorem for expressions involving the gradient of a solution on the boundary. In our next result, we let [formula] denote the tangential component of the gradient of u. The following theorem gives a recipe for recovering [formula] from the gradient of fN on the boundary, the boundary values of γ, and the Dirichlet to Neumann map acting on fN.

Let Ω be a Lipschitz domain and let x and fN be as in Theorem [\ref=Brown]. Let α be a constant vector. We have

[formula]

The rather mysterious expression on the right is obtain by rewriting the Rellich identity [\cite=Re1] using [formula] for the normal derivative. The following identity holds because the integrands are equal as functions

[formula]

Recalling that uN is a solution, an application of the divergence theorem gives

[formula]

We use the non-tangential maximal function estimate ([\ref=NTEstimates]) to justify the application of the divergence theorem. With this, the theorem follows from the properties of uN given in Theorem [\ref=Brown].
