Hyers-Ulam stability of higher-order Cauchy-Euler dynamic equations on time scales

introduction

In 1940, Ulam [\cite=ulam] posed the following problem concerning the stability of functional equations: give conditions in order for a linear mapping near an approximately linear mapping to exist. The problem for the case of approximately additive mappings was solved by Hyers [\cite=hyers] who proved that the Cauchy equation is stable in Banach spaces, and the result of Hyers was generalized by Rassias [\cite=rassias]. Alsina and Ger [\cite=ag] were the first authors who investigated the Hyers-Ulam stability of a differential equation.

Since then there has been a significant amount of interest in Hyers-Ulam stability, especially in relation to ordinary differential equations, for example see [\cite=gavruta] [\cite=gjl] [\cite=jung] [\cite=jung2] [\cite=jung3] [\cite=jung4] [\cite=mmt] [\cite=mmt2] [\cite=pr] [\cite=rus]. Also of interest are many of the articles in a special issue guest edited by Rassias [\cite=rass2], dealing with Ulam, Hyers-Ulam, and Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability in various contexts. Also see Li and Shen [\cite=lishen1] [\cite=lishen2], Wang, Zhou, and Sun [\cite=wang], and Popa et al [\cite=popa] [\cite=bpx]. András and Mészáros [\cite=andras] recently used an operator approach to show the stability of linear dynamic equations on time scales with constant coefficients, as well as for certain integral equations. Anderson et al [\cite=and] proved the following concerning second-order non-homogeneous Cauchy-Euler equations on time scales:

Let [formula] (or [formula], the complex conjugate) be such that

[formula]

for all [formula], where [formula] satisfies a > 0. Then the Cauchy-Euler equation

[formula]

has Hyers-Ulam stability on [formula]. To wit, if there exists [formula] that satisfies

[formula]

for [formula], then there exists a solution [formula] of [\eqref=CEeq] given by

[formula]

where for any [formula] the function w is given by

[formula]

such that |y - u|  ≤  Kε on [formula] for some constant K > 0.

The motivation for this work is to extend Theorem [\ref=coroCE] to the general nth-order Cauchy-Euler dynamic equation; we will show the stability in the sense of Hyers and Ulam of the equation

[formula]

This is essentially [\cite=bp2] if φ(t) = t and f(t) = 0. Throughout this work we assume the reader has a working knowledge of time scales as can be found in Bohner and Peterson [\cite=bp1] [\cite=bp2], originally introduced by Hilger [\cite=hilger].

Hyers-Ulam stability for higher-order Cauchy-Euler dynamic equations

In this section we establish the Hyers-Ulam stability of the higher-order non-homogeneous Cauchy-Euler dynamic equation on time scales of the form

[formula]

for given constants [formula] with [formula], and for functions [formula], using the following definition.

Let [formula] and [formula]. If whenever [formula] satisfies

[formula]

there exists a solution u of [\eqref=2ndivc] with [formula] for [formula] such that |x - u|  ≤  Kε on [formula] for some constant K > 0, then [\eqref=2ndivc] has Hyers-Ulam stability [formula].

Before proving the Hyers-Ulam stability of [\eqref=2ndivc] we will need the following lemma, which allows us to factor [\eqref=2ndivc] using the elementary symmetric polynomials [\cite=pbg] in the n symbols [formula] given by

[formula]

In general, we let sji represent the ith elementary symmetric polynomial on j symbols. Then, given the αk in [\eqref=2ndivc], introduce the characteristic values [formula] via the elementary symmetric polynomial snt on the n symbols [formula], where

[formula]

Given [formula] and [formula] with [formula], let [formula], where M0y(t): = y(t) and [formula] for [formula]. Then we have the factorization

[formula]

where the differential operator D is defined via Dx = xΔ for [formula], and I is the identity operator.

We proceed by mathematical induction on [formula], utilizing the substitution defined in [\eqref=alphas]. For n = 1,

[formula]

and the result holds. Assume [\eqref=factorize] holds for n  ≥  1. Then we have [formula] and

[formula]

and the proof is complete.

Given [formula] with |φ|  ≥  A > 0 for some constant A, and [formula] with [formula], consider [\eqref=2ndivc] with [formula] for [formula]. Using the λk from the factorization in Lemma [formula], assume

[formula]

for all [formula]. Then [\eqref=2ndivc] has Hyers-Ulam stability on [formula].

Let ε > 0 be given, and suppose there is a function x, with [formula], that satisfies

[formula]

We will show there exists a solution u of [\eqref=2ndivc] with [formula] for [formula] such that |x - u|  ≤  Kε on [formula] for some constant K > 0.

To this end, set

[formula]

This implies by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.3] that

[formula]

so that

[formula]

By the construction of gn we have [formula], that is

[formula]

By [\cite=and] and [\eqref=CEregress] there exists a solution [formula] of

[formula]

[formula], where w1 is given by

[formula]

and there exists an L1 > 0 such that

[formula]

Since gn - 1  =  φgΔn - 2  -  λn - 1gn - 2, we have that

[formula]

Again we apply [\cite=and] to see that there exists a solution [formula] of

[formula]

[formula], where w2 is given by

[formula]

and there exists an L2 > 0 such that

[formula]

Continuing in this manner, we see that for [formula] there exists a solution [formula] of

[formula]

[formula], where wk is given by

[formula]

and there exists an Lk > 0 such that

[formula]

In particular, for k = n - 1,

[formula]

implies by the definition of g1 that

[formula]

Thus there exists a solution [formula] of

[formula]

[formula], where wn is given by

[formula]

and there exists an Ln > 0 such that

[formula]

By construction,

[formula]

on [formula], so that u = wn is a solution of [\eqref=2ndivc], with [formula] and |x(t) - wn(t)|  ≤  Kε for [formula] by [\eqref=xminusw]. Moreover, using [\eqref=wnform] and [\eqref=wkform], we have an iterative formula for this solution u = wn in terms of the function x given at the beginning of the proof.
