A note on the hypercontractivity of the polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille inequality

Introduction

If [formula] is an m-homogeneous polynomial defined by

[formula]

and [formula] is the unit polydisc in [formula] let

[formula]

The Sidon constant S1(m,n) (see [\cite=annals] [\cite=seip]) is the smallest constant satisfying the inequality

[formula]

for all m-homogeneous polynomials [formula] From [\cite=annals] [\cite=seip] (see also the references therein) we know that there is an absolute constant [formula] such that

[formula]

It is also known that this result is sharp (we refer to [\cite=annals] [\cite=seip] and the references therein).

The inequality ([\ref=sid]) is related to the famous polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille inequality for complex scalars (see [\cite=bh]). Since the polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille inequality is hypercontractive for both real and complex scalars (see [\cite=CMPS] [\cite=annals]), there exists a constant [formula] such that

[formula]

for all positive integers n and all m-homogeneous polynomials [formula], with [formula] or [formula].

It is well-known that ([\ref=comp]) is a corollary of ([\ref=09]). In fact, according to [\cite=fr] there are constants [formula] such that

[formula]

For related recent results we refer to [\cite=Nu3] [\cite=os] [\cite=Se] and [\cite=seip3] for a panorama of the subject.

Both ([\ref=comp]) and the polynomial (and multilinear) Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities were originally conceived for complex scalars; the reason is that these inequalities were motivated by problems arising over the complex scalar field. In the last years, however, the interest in the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality encompassed the case of real scalars, mainly due to its connections with Quantum Information Theory (see [\cite=montanaro]).

In this note we remark that ([\ref=comp]) and ([\ref=09]) are particular cases of a continuum family of sharp inequalities for both complex and real scalars:

Let [formula] m,n be positive integers and [formula] [formula] or [formula] There is an universal constant [formula] such that

[formula]

for all m-homogeneous polynomials [formula] Moreover, the power [formula] is optimal.

It is worth mentioning that, in general, the adaptation of asymptotic results involving homogeneous polynomials from the complex setting to real scalars is not a straightforward task. In fact, sometimes polynomials present a completely different behavior when we change the scalar field from [formula] to [formula] (we refer to [\cite=studia] for an illustrative example of this fact).

The proof

Let r∈ . The proof of ([\ref=ki]) for complex scalars is easily obtained by adapting the argument used in ([\ref=0p]). For real scalars, according to [\cite=CMPS], if [formula] is an m-homogeneous polynomial, then

[formula]

where [formula] is the complexification of P; this result goes back to the Visser's paper [\cite=Visser]. So, we obtain ([\ref=0p]) for real scalars. It also simple to see that the constant [formula] can be chosen independent of m,r,n. Now let us prove the optimality of the exponent [formula] for this task let us suppose that the result holds for a power [formula].

For each m,n, let

[formula]

be the m-homogeneous Bernoulli polynomial satisfying the Kahane-Salem-Zygmund inequality (note that this inequality is also valid for real scalars, see [\cite=Nun2]).

The proof follows the lines of [\cite=Nun2]; the essence of this argument can be traced back to Boas' classical paper [\cite=Boas]. We can suppose n > m. As in [\cite=Nun2], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is a polynomial of degree m - 1. If ([\ref=ki]) was valid with the power q, then there would exist a constant [formula] so that

[formula]

where CKSZ > 0 is the universal constant from the Kahane-Salem-Zygmund inequality. Hence

[formula]

for all n. Raising both sides to the power of r and letting n  →    ∞   we obtain

[formula]

with

[formula]

Since [formula], we have deg s = m > qr + r(m + 1) / 2 and thus the limit above is infinity, a contradiction.
