Anomalous Hall Effect in perpendicularly magnetized Mn3 - xGa thin films

Recently, the integration of materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy into magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have found a lot of attraction due to the predicted lowered current densities for current induced switching and a higher thermal stability.[\cite=Kent:2004p3669] The perpendicular anisotropy of magnetic thin films for the integration into MTJs can be realized differently.

One example for common perpendicular thin films are ()n[\cite=Kugler:2011p3334] or ()n[\cite=Carcia:1985p2264] multilayers which take advantage of interface anisotropy.

Another approach to induce a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is the utilization of ferromagnetic materials in combination with rare earth elements. The integration of such films into so-called perpendicular MTJs (pMTJs) or spin valves (SPVs) was reported by Nakayama et al.[\cite=Nakayama:2008p3670] and Li et al.[\cite=Li:2010p3257] for Tb+CoFe and Tb+Co2FeAl.

However, for the industrial applicability a single perpendicular film is preferred to avoid process complications and to realize tunnel junctions and spin valves with a total thickness below 10 nm.

Furthermore, materials with a high spin polarization like Heusler compounds [\cite=DeGroot:1983p65] are eligible for the integration into MTJs to realize high tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios. Such junctions with half-metallic Heusler junctions have been successfully demonstrated in the recent years by several groups for in-plane magnetization.[\cite=Ebke:2010p1637] [\cite=Wang:2009p858] [\cite=Tsunegi:2008p68] [\cite=Tezuka:2009p912]

A high spin polarization and an out-of-plane magnetization is predicted for the Heusler compound Mn3Ga.[\cite=Balke:2007p2533] [\cite=Winterlik:2008p2531] [\cite=Wurmehl:2006p2224] Such films exhibit a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and experimental values of up to 1.2  ×  107 erg/cm3 are reported by Wu et al. for the effective anisotropy constant Keffu.[\cite=Wu:2010p4215] Furthermore, the spin polarization of Mn3Ga thin films was determined experimentally by point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR). Here, a maximum value of 58% is reported by Kurt et al.[\cite=Kurt:2011p3666] Additionally, a high spin polarization of Mn2Ga is concluded by Wu et al. from electrical transport properties studies using anomalous (or extraordinary) Hall-effect.[\cite=Wu:2010p4215] Therefore, the Mn3 - xGa compounds fulfill all required items of a high performance spin torque device suggested by the shopping list of Graf et al.[\cite=Graf:2011jj]

In this work, we have investigated the magnetic, crystallographic and transport properties of Mn3 - xGa thin films (x = 0.1, 0.4, 0.7). A magnetic perpendicular anisotropy of these layers can be realized when grown in the crystallographic D022 phase (Figure 1a)).

DC and RF magnetron sputtering was used for the preparation of our thin films. The Mn3 - xGa layers were co-deposited in a UHV system from a Mn50Ga50 and a Mn sputtering target to adjust the stoichiometry which was verified by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements. The Mn-Ga layers were deposited on MgO (001) and SrTiO3 (001) (STO) substrates at different substrate temperatures of up to 650[formula]C to generate a tetragonal distorted crystal structure. A layer thickness of 23, 25 and 27  nm was determined for the Mn2.3Ga, Mn2.6Ga and Mn2.9Ga films. The Ar pressure was 1.3  ×  10- 3 mbar and the growth rate was set to ≈   0.4 nm/sec. The lattice mismatch of 7  % for MgO (aMgO = 4.21 Å) and < 1  % for SrTiO3 (aSTO = 3.91 Å) allows a coherent growth of the Mn3 - xGa films (a[formula] Å) in c axis orientation. Finally, the layers were capped by a 2 nm thick MgO layer to prevent the Mn3 - xGa from oxidation.

Figure 1b) schematically shows the used Hall bars (1 mm wide ×   2.5 mm long), which were patterned by optical lithography and ion beam etching. Contact pads were fabricated by depositing Ta (5 nm) and Au (40 nm). The measurements of the transport properties were carried out by 4-terminal arrangement in a temperature range between 20 K and 330 K. The Hall voltage was measured in a magnetic field of up to 1 T perpendicular to the film plane.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed by a Philips X'pert pro diffractometer (λCu,kα = 1.5418  Å) to find the optimal deposition temperature for the Mn3 - xGa layers. The intended tetragonal D022 phase was found for deposition temperatures from 490[formula]C to 570[formula]C. The diffraction pattern of the Mn-Ga films which were prepared at lower deposition temperatures show peaks which can be attributed to the cubic D03 phase. Higher deposition temperatures leads to a phase change into the hexagonal D019 phase.

Figure 2a) shows the obtained Θ/2Θ scans for the investigated Mn-Ga compositions deposited at 530[formula]C on MgO and STO substrates, respectively. The (002) and (004) superlattice peaks are clearly visible at 24.6 and 50.4 degree. Additionally, the presence of the (006) peak at 79.2 degree demonstrates a high film quality. The substrate peaks can be found at 42.9 (002) degree for MgO and at 22.8 (001), 46.5 (002) and 72.6 (003) degree for STO. The corresponding c axis lattice constants ranges are cMgO  =  7.18 to 7.22 Å  on MgO substrates and cSTO  =  7.22 to 7.25 Å  on STO substrates. In both cases the lattice expands slightly with decreasing Mn content. Winterlik et al. also observed this behavior and attributed it to the removal of Mn of the X positions.[\cite=Winterlik:2008p2531] The different c axis parameter for MgO and STO originate from the lattice mismatch in the a-b plane. The Mn-Ga in-plane lattice constants ([formula] Å) perfectly matches the STO substrate lattice (aSTO = 3.91 Å). This leads to a higher crystallinity of the Mn-Ga films when compared to these grown on MgO substrates. As shown in Figure 2b) a higher (004) peak intensity and a lower full width at half maximum (FWHM) (Figure 2c)) was determined from the XRD pattern for the Mn2.9Ga films which were deposited on STO. Here, a minimum FWHM of 0.48 degree was achieved for a deposition temperature of 530[formula]C. The values are as low as the values reported by Wu et al. [\cite=Wu:2009p2744] for similar films and indicate the good crystalline quality of these films. The intended tetragonal D022 phase of the Mn-Ga films was verified by pole figure scans. The fourfold (011) peak could be observed for all investigated stoichiometries in a deposition temperature range from 490[formula]C to 570[formula]C.

To investigate the surface roughness of the Mn3 - xGa thin films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed. The surface structure is an important factor for the further integration of Mn3 - xGa into magnetic tunnel junctions. A high roughness will produce pinholes through the barrier, thus the tunnel probability tends to zero. Figure 3 presents the rms surface roughness in relation to the deposition temperature for a 27 nm thick Mn2.9Ga thin film. The rms surface roughness obtained a minimum value in the temperature regime between 490 and 570[formula]C, where the crystallographic properties are ideal. For thin films on STO substrates the proper deposition temperature is 530[formula]C (0.21 nm rms) and on MgO substrates 570[formula]C (0.54 nm rms). The films deposited at 530[formula]C on STO show a roughness comparable with the data obtained by Wu et al.[\cite=Wu:2010p2745] Our films grown on MgO are smoother than films prepared by Kurt et al. Samples prepared on STO showed a smoother surface when compared to Pt-buffered samples, due to the lower lattice mismatch.[\cite=Kurt:2011p3666]

Figure 4 shows an overlay of magnetization data (grey) and the transversal Hall resistivity ϱxy for all compositions deposited at 530[formula]C. A maximum value of ϱsatxy = 2.2  μΩcm can be found for the saturated Hall resistivity of the Mn2.9Ga film deposited on MgO. All values are lower when compared to Mn2Ga films reported by Wu et al. (11.5  μΩcm)[\cite=Wu:2010p4215] which might originate from different preparation conditions such as growth rate, pressure and temperature. As expected, we found a decreasing magnetic moment with increasing Mn content for the layers deposited on STO. The decrease in the magnetic moment originates again from a higher removal of Mn on the X positions compared to the Y positions, which leads to a nonequilibrium of compensating Mn moments.[\cite=Winterlik:2008p2531] By contrast, the lowest moment for films deposited on MgO was found for Mn2.6Ga. Most likely, the higher magnetization we found for Mn2.9Ga is due to atomic disorder. In addition, the magnetic moment for thin films on MgO is higher than for layers on STO substrates. This characteristic arise from the bigger expansion in the a-b plane for Mn3 - xGa on MgO substrates. Due to this expansion the cell area increases with decreasing height, which leads to a weakening in the compensation between the Mn atoms on the X and Y positions.

To quantify the degree of order in our layers, we have analyzed the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity ϱxx (Figure 5a) which can be expressed as ϱxx(T) = ϱxx0  +  ϱxxT(T). The values were determined by a linear fit of ϱxx in the temperature range of 100 K to RT. The temperature dependent contribution of the resistivity ϱxxT stands for the degree of electron scattering on phonons and magnons. The highest values were observed for Mn2.9Ga on MgO and Mn2.6Ga (Figure 5b)). Furthermore, the ϱxx0 represents atomic disorder or impurities (Figure 5c)). The extracted values scale reverse the magnetic moments. A maximum ϱxx0 was found for the nearly compensated Mn2.9Ga film deposited on STO. Because of the higher film quality we found for layers grown on STO this is most likely due to the antiparrallel aligned Mn moments instead of atomic disorder.

Generally, the Hall resistivity consists of two contributions: ϱxy = R0H + RS4πMS, where R0 is the ordinary Hall coefficient and RS the anomalous Hall coefficient. Because ϱxy in Figure 4 has a similar shape to the magnetization hysteresis loops, the AHE is much larger than the ordinary Hall effect in the investigated samples. The anomalous Hall resistivity depends on intrinsic and extrinsic effects and can be expressed as: ϱxy  =  Φskϱxx  +  κϱ2xx

Here, the parameter Φsk of the linear term of the longitudinal resistivity ϱxx represents the extrinsic skew scattering.[\cite=Smit:1958p4317] The κ of the quadratic term contains the extrinsic conductivity κsj, which originates from the side-jump mechanism and the intrinsic conductivity κint, which originates from the band structure.[\cite=Berger:1964p4319]

A linear fit of the function ln ϱxy vs ln ϱxx is applied to distinguish the dominating mechanism from the experimental data. The data and the corresponding fit functions of the investigated samples are given in Figure 6a). A slope m of the fit function with m = 1 gives a dominating skew scattering mechanism whereas m = 2 represents the side jump and the intrinsic mechanism.[\cite=Luttinger:1958p3663] [\cite=Berger:1970p4318] Except the slope of m = 2.1 for the Mn2.9Ga sample grown on STO, the determined slopes of the fit functions (Figure 6b) indicating a contribution of both mechanism. A dominating skew scattering can be deduced for layers with higher magnetization.

For extended differentiation between skew scattering and intrinsic factor, the values of Φsk and κ are determined by a linear fit when ϱxy  /  ϱxx is plotted vs ϱxx as shown in Figure 7a). The resulting slope of the fit characterizes κ (Figure 6c)), the y-axis intercept represents Φsk (Figure 7b)). The extracted Φsk value for the Mn2.9Ga film on STO nearly vanishes (- 1.0  ×  10- 3) as expected from Figure 5b). Additionally, a similar low value (1.6  ×  10- 3) can be found for Mn2.6Ga on MgO. The corresponding κ values range between 25 and 64  S/cm. Notably, the κ values of films grown on STO are throughout higher when compared to these grown on MgO. Probably, this represents the higher ordering we found for STO from XRD measurements.

In summary, we have fabricated Mn3 - xGa thin films at various deposition temperatures. Because of the difference in the magnetic moment for different compositions. We conclude that Mn2.9Ga is the favorable composition for spintronic devices, because of the low magnetic moment. We found STO substrates to be preferable when compared with MgO substrates with regard to the crystalline quality of the films. The observed higher κ contribution of this layers might be attributed to the ordering. Finally, we conclude that the obtained skew scattering is correlated to the magnetic moment of the Mn3 - xGa films.
