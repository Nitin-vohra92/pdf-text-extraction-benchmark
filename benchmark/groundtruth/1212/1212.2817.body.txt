Introduction and statement of the main result

In the present paper X always denotes a real separable infinite-dimensional Banach space; by ball in X we mean a closed ball. Let A be a collection of subsets of X. We say that A is point-finite if every point of X belongs to at most finitely many elements of A. A point x of X is said to be a regular point for A if there is a neighborhood of x that meets at most finitely many elements of A; x is said to be a singular point for A otherwise. If every point of X is a regular point for A, we say that A is locally-finite (clearly, that is equivalent to the requirement that no compact set in X meets infinitely many members of A). A is said a covering of X if each point of X belongs to some member of A.

The aim of the present paper is to take a step forward to answering the following

Which infinite-dimensional Banach spaces admit point-finite coverings by balls (each of positive radius)?

In order to explain how such a question arises, we recall the following two results (the first one is well known as "the Corson's Theorem").

No (infinite-dimensional) reflexive Banach space admits locally finite coverings by bounded closed convex sets.

Any real Banach space X can be covered by bounded closed convex sets, each with nonempty interior, in such a way that no point of X belongs to more than two of them.

The family of sets exhibited in the general construction used to prove Theorem [\ref=index2] is very far from being a family of balls in the original norm of X. Moreover, some classical Banach spaces admit point-finite coverings by balls. For instance, it is easy to check that the covering of c0 that can be obtained by translating the unit ball without overlapping interiors is even locally finite. V. Klee proved in [\cite=Kl] that the space l1(Γ) for suitable (uncountable) Γ can be covered by translates of its unit ball without overlapping them at all. So Question [\ref=question] seems to be very natural, though providing it with a complete answer seems not to be an easy matter. A first step in that direction have been recently made with the following Theorem, that excludes Hilbert spaces from the class of spaces Question [\ref=question] asks for. Even if, looking for spaces outside that class, Hilbert spaces appear as the simplest ones to be considered, up to now no elementary argument for getting such exclusion seems to be available.

No covering by balls, each of positive radius, of the infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space can be point-finite.

We refer to [\cite=FZ] also for more details and references concerning the subjects involved in the present Introduction. The goal of this paper is to extend Theorem [\ref=Hilbert] to a considerably wider class of spaces. In fact we prove the following

No covering by balls, each of positive radius, of any infinite-dimensional uniformly rotund and uniformly smooth separable Banach space can be point-finite.

It is very well known that those Banach spaces that are uniformly rotund or uniformly smooth are reflexive (in fact, super-reflexive). Moreover, if a Banach space X is uniformly rotund or uniformly smooth, then an equivalent norm can be put on X under which X is both uniformly rotund and uniformly smooth. Among those spaces that are both uniformly rotund and uniformly smooth there are Lp(μ) spaces for any measure μ and p∈(1,  +    ∞  ), so in particular we claim

No covering by balls, each of positive radius, of a separable infinite-dimensional Lp(μ) space, 1 < p <   ∞  , μ any measure, can be point-finite.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=goal] we provide here is based on a key result of [\cite=FZ]; however, after that, it follows a completely different way than what was used in [\cite=FZ] to get Theorem [\ref=Hilbert]. In fact the argument there runs as follows. Separable polyhedral Banach spaces are first characterized as those whose unit sphere under some equivalent norm admits a point-finite covering by slices of the unit ball that do not contain the origin. (Recall that a Banach space is called "polyhedral" if the unit ball of any its finite-dimensional subspace is a polytope.) As a consequence, if the unit sphere of some separable Banach space X admits such a covering, then X must be isomorphically polyhedral. It is well known that no (infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space is isomorphically polyhedral. Next, point-finite coverings of the Hilbert space by balls (if any) are easily reduced to point-finite coverings of the unit sphere by balls that do not contain the origin. Finally, to get a contradiction, these coverings are reduced to point-finite coverings of the unit sphere by slices of the unit ball via the following observation: whenever two spheres in an inner product space do not coincide and have nonempty intersection, such an intersection lies in some hyperplane; this hyperplane splits each of the two balls determined by those spheres in two complementary slices. Unfortunately such a situation characterizes inner product spaces (see [\cite=Ami] (15.17)), so the argument cannot be applied outside that class of spaces.

Our argument here in proving Theorem [\ref=goal] has an essential topological component: Corson's Theorem [\ref=corson], which is based on Brouwer's fixed point Theorem, is now our basic tool. We use it in connection with suitable considerations of geometrical nature.

Throughout the paper we use standard Geometry of Banach Spaces notation as in [\cite=JL]. In particular, for x∈X and r > 0, B(x,r) and S(x,r) respectively denote the closed ball and the sphere with center at x and radius r; moreover, B(0,1) and S(0,1) are denoted in short respectively by BX and SX.

Proof of the main result

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=goal], first of all we notice that, X being separable, we can confine ourselves to prove our theorem for countable coverings. (In fact, let {xn} be any sequence dense in X: since each ball has nonempty interior, for some n0 it must happen that xn0 belongs to uncountably many balls.)

We start by borrowing from [\cite=FZ] the following Proposition. It describes a quite general situation in which a sequence of slices of the unit ball of any separable Banach space cannot be point-finite.

Let {fi}∞i = 1 be a sequence of norm-one linear functionals on X and {αi}∞i = 1 a sequence in the interval (0,1) converging to 0. Then the sequence {Si}∞i = 1 of slices of BX defined by

[formula]

is not point-finite.

Next we point out a very simple (probably well known) fact.

Roughly speaking, it simply states that any point of a sphere of any uniformly smooth Banach space admits "almost flat" neighborhoods (relative to the sphere) of "big" diamater provided that the radius of the sphere is "big". We make this sentence precise in the following way.

Let X be uniformly smooth. For any ε  >  0 there exists b > 0 such that, for any R  >  b and x∈RSX, if Γx is the hyperplane supporting RBX at x, then

[formula]

Proof. For t∈SX, denote by ft the (only) norm-one linear functional such that ft(t) = 1. Fix ε > 0. By definition of uniform smoothness, for any ε > 0 there exists δ  =  δ(ε) > 0 such that for any w,z∈SX with ||w - z||  ≤  δ, the following estimate holds

[formula]

So for x  =  Rz,y  =  Rw∈RSX with ||y - x||  ≤   min{Rδ,2} it is true that

[formula]

By assuming b = 2 / δ we are done. [formula]

The previous fact allows us to say that, in a uniformly smooth space, a "big" sphere intersecting a "small" ball splits it in two parts that are not "too far" from being slices of the small ball. So Proposition 2.1 leads us to the following Proposition, which will be crucial for our purposes and may have interest by itself.

Let B  =  {B(xn,Rn)}∞n = 1 be a countable collection of balls in a uniformly smooth Banach space X such that Rn goes to infinity with n. If B is not locally finite, then it is not point-finite.

Proof. Since B is not locally finite, there exist a point x∈X and a sequence {nk} of integers such that

[formula]

Without loss of generality we may assume x = 0 and {nk}  =  {k}. Moreover, we may assume that 0∉B(xn,Rn) for every n and that Rn  >  2 and ||xn||  <  Rn  +  1. For any n, let zn be the point at which the segment

S = { t ∈ B: f(t) ≥ β + 1/i }

ε = ||x|| - R ≥ 0    and    = B(x, R + ε);
