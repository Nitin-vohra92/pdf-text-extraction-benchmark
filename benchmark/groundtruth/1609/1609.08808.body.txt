Lefschetz classes on projective varieties

Introduction

Let X be a d-dimensional smooth complex projective variety, and let [formula] be the commutative graded [formula]-algebra of algebraic cycles on X modulo homological equivalence

[formula]

A hyperplane section of [formula] defines a cohomology class [formula]. Grothendieck's standard conjectures predict that [formula] satisfies analogues of the hard Lefschetz theorem and Poincaré duality:

For every nonnegative integer [formula], the linear map

[formula]

is an isomorphism.

For every nonnegative integer [formula], the bilinear map

[formula]

is nondegenerate.

The properties (HL) and (PD) for [formula] are implied by the Hodge conjecture for X.

The Lefschetz algebra of X is the graded [formula]-subalgebra L*(X) of [formula] generated by divisor classes. When X is singular, we may define the Lefschetz algebra to be the graded [formula]-algebra in the intersection cohomology generated by the Chern classes of line bundles

[formula]

An application of Lefschetz algebras to the "top-heavy" conjecture in enumerative combinatorics was given in [\cite=Huh-Wang].

It was asked whether there are smooth projective varieties whose Lefschetz algebras do not satisfy analogues of the hard Lefschetz theorem and Poincaré duality [\cite=Kaveh]:

For every nonnegative integer [formula], the linear map

[formula]

is an isomorphism.

For every nonnegative integer [formula], the bilinear map

[formula]

is nondegenerate.

We show in Proposition [\ref=PropositionEquivalence] that (HL) and (PD) for L*(X) are equivalent to each other, and to the numerical condition that

[formula]

Many familiar smooth projective varieties satisfy (HL) and (PD) for L*(X). In Section [\ref=symmetric], we show that this is the case for

toric varieties,

abelian varieties,

Grassmannians and full flag varieties,

wonderful compactifications of arrangement complements,

products of two or more varieties listed above,

complete intersections of ample divisors in the varieties listed above,

all smooth projective varieties with Picard number 1, and

all smooth projective varieties of dimension at most 4.

In Section [\ref=nonsymmetric], we construct three varieties whose Lefschetz algebras do not satisfy (HL) and (PD).

There is a d-dimensional smooth complex projective variety X with the property

[formula]

The first example has dimension 5 and Picard number 2, and the second example has dimension 6 and Picard number 3. The third example is a partial flag variety; it shows that the assumption made in [\cite=Kaveh] is not redundant.

Lefschetz algebras with Poincaré duality

Let [formula] be a d-dimensional smooth complex projective variety, and let ω∈L1(X) be the cohomology class of a hyperplane section.

The following statements are equivalent.

The Lefschetz algebra L*(X) satisfies the hard Lefschetz theorem, that is, the linear map

[formula]

is an isomorphism for every nonnegative integer [formula].

The Lefschetz algebra L*(X) satisfies Poincaré duality, that is, the bilinear map

[formula]

is nondegenerate for every nonnegative integer [formula].

The Lefschetz algebra L*(X) has symmetric dimensions, that is, the equality

[formula]

holds for every nonnegative integer [formula].

Clearly, (1) implies (3), and (2) implies (3). The hard Lefschetz theorem for [formula] shows that (3) implies (1). We prove that (3) implies (2).

Suppose (3), or equivalently, (1). This implies that, for every nonnegative integer [formula],

[formula]

In other words, every primitive component appearing in the Lefschetz decomposition of an element x∈Lk(X) is an element of L*(X). Let us write

[formula]

If x is nonzero, then some summand ωk - jxj is nonzero. The Hodge-Riemann relation for the primitive subspace of Hj,j(X) shows that

[formula]

Thus the product of x with ωd - j - kxj is nonzero, and hence L*(X) satisfies Poincaré duality.

Many familiar smooth projective varieties have Lefschetz algebras satisfying Poincaré duality. The most obvious examples are the varieties with [formula], such as smooth projective toric varieties, complete flag varieties, wonderful compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements, etc. We collect more examples in the remainder of this section.

For every nonnegative integer [formula], the linear map

[formula]

is injective. For k = 0 and k = 1, the map is bijective.

We prove the assertion for k = 1. By the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem, we have

[formula]

The hard Lefschetz theorem for [formula] implies that the left-hand side is isomorphic to

[formula]

which contains Ld - 1(X) as a subspace. This forces [formula].

Suppose any one of the following conditions:

X is an abelian variety.

X has Picard number 1.

X has dimension at most 4.

Then L*(X) satisfies Poincaré duality.

([\ref=c1]) is proved by Milne [\cite=Milne]. ([\ref=c2]) and ([\ref=c3]) follow from Proposition [\ref=PropositionEquivalence] and Lemma [\ref=LemmaSmallk].

We may construct Lefschetz algebras with Poincaré duality by taking hyperplane sections. Let ι be the inclusion of a smooth ample hypersurface D  ⊆  X with cohomology class ω∈L1(X).

If L*(X) satisfies Poincaré duality, then L*(D) satisfies Poincaré duality.

The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for D  ⊆  X and Poincaré duality for D show that the pullback ι* in cohomology induces a commutative diagram

[formula]

If L*(X) satisfies Poincaré duality, then [formula] satisfies Poincaré duality:

[formula]

When d < 4, the conclusion follows from Proposition [\ref=goodones] applied to D. Assuming d  ≥  4, we show that the induced map [formula] is an isomorphism.

When d  ≥  4, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for Picard groups applies to the inclusion D  ⊆  X, and therefore [formula] is surjective [\cite=Lazarsfeld]. To conclude, we deduce from the hard Lefschetz theorem for [formula] that

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=LemmaSmallk] applied to D shows that [formula] is an injective in the remaining degrees [formula].

We may construct Lefschetz algebras with Poincaré duality by taking products. Let X1 and X2 be smooth projective varieties, and suppose that [formula].

There is an isomorphism between graded algebras

[formula]

Thus L*(X1  ×  X2) satisfies Poincaré duality if L*(X1) and L*(X2) satisfy Poincaré duality.

By the Künneth formula, there is an isomorphism of Hodge structures

[formula]

The above restricts to an isomorphism between subspaces

[formula]

which induces an isomorphism of graded [formula]-algebras [formula].

Proposition [\ref=goodones], Proposition [\ref=hyperplane], and Proposition [\ref=product] justify that the eight classes of smooth projective varieties listed in the introduction have Lefschetz algebras with Poincaré duality.

Lefschetz algebras without Poincaré duality

We construct three smooth projective varieties whose Lefschetz algebras do not satisfy Poincaré duality. Before giving the construction, we recall standard description of the cohomology ring of a blowup.

Let Z be a codimension r smooth subvariety of a d-dimensional smooth projective variety Y. We write π:X  →  Y for the blowup of Y along Z, and ι:Z  →  Y for the inclusion of Z in Y:

[formula]

The cohomology ring of the blowup X can be described as follows [\cite=GH].

There is a decomposition of graded vector spaces

[formula]

where e is the cohomology class of the exceptional divisor in X. The cup product satisfies

[formula]

and, writing NZ / Y for the normal bundle of the embedding ι:Z  →  Y, we have

[formula]

We abuse notation and suppress the symbols ι* and π* in computations below.

A 5-dimensional example

According to Proposition [\ref=goodones], if X is a smooth projective variety whose Lefschetz algebra does not satisfy Poincaré duality, then the dimension of X is at least 5 and the Picard number of X is at least 2. We construct such an example of dimension 5 and Picard number 2.

Let [formula] be a smooth plane cubic curve, let Y be the projective space [formula], and let Z be the product [formula]. We write ι for the composition of inclusions

[formula]

where the second map is the Segre embedding. Let X be the blowup of Y along Z.

[formula] and [formula].

We have [formula], where a and b are cohomology classes of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Writing c for the cohomology class of a hyperplane in Y, we have

[formula]

where e is the cohomology class of the exceptional divisor in X.

The algebra L*(X) is generated by c and e. The restriction of c to Z is a + 3b, and hence

[formula]

This proves the first assertion.

We next show [formula]. It is enough to check that e3 is not in the subspace

[formula]

According to Proposition [\ref=blowup], the following relation holds in the cohomology of X:

[formula]

Since [formula] is a multiple of ce2 and [formula] is a multiple of abe, we have

[formula]

The tangent bundle of the elliptic curve C is trivial, and therefore [formula] must be a multiple of ae2. It follows that e3 is not contained in V. This proves the second assertion.

A 6-dimensional example

A simpler example can be found in dimension 6. Let [formula], and let [formula]. We write ι for the composition of inclusions

[formula]

where [formula] is the identity map, δ is the diagonal embedding, and s is the Segre embedding. Let X be the blowup of Y along Z.

[formula] and [formula].

Write y1, y2 for the cohomology classes

[formula]

and write z1, z2, z3 for the cohomology classes

[formula]

Note that ι*y1 = z1 + z2 and ι*y2 = z2 + z3. According to Proposition [\ref=blowup],

[formula]

where e is the cohomology of the exceptional divisor in X.

The vector space L2(X) is spanned by the cohomology classes y21, y1y2, y22, e2,

[formula]

From the above description of [formula], we see that the six elements are linearly independent. This proves the first assertion.

We next check [formula]. Note that L4(X) contains y31y2, y21y22, y1y32, and

[formula]

From the above description of [formula], we see that the seven elements span [formula]. This proves the second assertion.

An 8-dimensional example

Let X be the 8-dimensional partial flag variety

[formula]

We show that the Lefschetz algebra of X does not satisfy Poincaré duality. This is in contrast with the case of Grassmannians and full flag varieties.

[formula] and [formula].

We use standard facts and notations in Schubert calculus [\cite=Eisenbud-Harris]. Let Y be the Grassmannian variety parametrizing 2-dimensional subspaces of [formula]. The Schubert classes form a basis of the cohomology of Y:

[formula]

We write Q for the universal quotient bundle on Y. Since X is the projectivization [formula],

[formula]

where ζ is the first Chern class of the line bundle [formula].

The Lefschetz algebra of X is generated by [formula] and ζ, and therefore

[formula]

This proves the first assertion.

We now show that [formula]. For this we use four elements

[formula]

It is enough to prove that the last element [formula] is not contained in the subspace

[formula]

According to [\cite=Eisenbud-Harris], the Chern classes of Q are

[formula]

In other words, [formula] in the cohomology of [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

This proves the second assertion.
