Sonneberg plate photometry in two colors for KIC 8462852:No dimming between 1934 and 1995

Introduction

The Kepler Space Telescope's exquisite photometry has allowed for the detection of more than a thousand exoplanets [\citep=2010Sci...327..977B]. The data have also been used for a wide range of stellar studies [\citep=2011ApJ...743..143H] [\citep=2015ApJ...798...42H]. One very peculiar object is KIC 8462852 (TYC 3162-665-1). This is an F3 main-sequence star, which was observed by the NASA Kepler mission from April 2009 to May 2013. An analysis by [\citet=2016MNRAS.457.3988B] shows inexplicable series of day-long brightness dips up to 20%. The behavior has been theorized to originate from a family of large comets [\citep=2016ApJ...819L..34B], or signs of a Dyson sphere [\citep=2016ApJ...816...17W]. Subsequent analysis found no narrow-band radio signals [\citep=2016ApJ...825..155H] and no periodic pulsed optical signals [\citep=2016ApJ...825L...5S] [\citep=2016ApJ...818L..33A]. The infrared flux is equally unremarkable [\citep=2015ApJ...815L..27L] [\citep=2015ApJ...814L..15M] [\citep=2016MNRAS.458L..39T]. Recently, the star has been claimed to dim by 0.164 mag ([formula]) between 1890 and 1990 [\citep=2016ApJ...822L..34S], and lost [formula] of brightness during the 4.25yrs of Kepler mission [\citep=2016arXiv160801316M]. The century-long dimming has been challenged by [\citet=2016ApJ...825...73H] and [\citet=2016arXiv160502760L]. The distance estimates from Gaia's DR1 parallax ([formula] pc, [\citet=2016arXiv160905492H]) cannot constrain the absolute magnitude of the star. To resolve the controversy whether this star has dimmed considerably over 130 years (and perhaps more so earlier), it is crucial to gather more data.

Method

The plate photometry used in the previous long-term studies was taken by the Harvard College Observatory, which observed large portions of the sky repeatedly between 1886 and 1992. The photographs were taken on glass plates mainly with a blue-sensitive emulsion. The plates were digitized with a high speed scanner [\citep=2006SPIE.6312E..17S]. The initial photometry and astrometry are described in [\citet=2010AJ....140.1062L] and [\citet=2011ASPC..442..273S], and the current progress is summarized in [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T]. Today, the archive can be accessed over the internet (DASCH, Digital Access to a Sky Century Harvard) [\citep=2009ASPC..410..101G] [\citep=2010AJ....140.1062L] [\citep=2012IAUS..285..243G] [\citep=2012IAUS..285...29G].

A major issue for long-term photometry spanning 130 years were changes in emulsion, filters, geographic locations, aging of optics, and the use of 16 different telescopes [\citep=2016ApJ...825...73H]. These changes might introduce small offsets in zeropoints, on the level of < 0.1mag, and are very hard to determine and remove from timeseries. Also, observations ceased in the 1960s during the so-called "Menzel gap", when organizational changes reduced the observatory activities. It has been speculated that KIC 8462852 has undergone a dimming event in this decade [\citep=2016arXiv160801316M], but such is hard to verify without data.

Sonneberg Plate Archive

The second largest plate archive in the world, after Harvard, is located at Sonneberg Observatory [\citep=1992Stern..68...19B]. The archive was fed by two different observation programme: the Sky Patrol, taken with 14 short-focus cameras of the same optics, plate sizes and emulsions, covered the entire sky between about 1935 and 2010 in a very homogeneous manner in two color bands, pg (blue) and pv (red) [\citep=1992Stern..68...19B] [\citep=1999AcHA....6...70B]. The deeper Field Patrol aimed at recording about 80 selected areas mostly along the Milky Way and the Galactic North Pole. The archive contains a total of about 275,000 plates.

For this study we have used the Sky Patrol plates of [formula] cm2 size, a scale of 830 arc sec per mm, giving a field size of about [formula]. The limiting magnitudes are of the order of 14.5 mag in pg and 13.5 mag in pv, but the average limit achieved is about one mag brighter than these values. Plate scanning was initially performed with a digitalization machine, but subsequently upgraded with more, and more modern, scanners. Scan resolution was 15 Î¼m at 16 bit data depth.

Sonneberg plates have been used in previous studies, including novae [\citep=2009AJ....138.1846C] [\citep=2010PZ.....30....4G] [\citep=2014ApJ...780L..25J], protostellar stars [\citep=2010AJ....139.1527X], RR Lyrae [\citep=2010IBVS.5926....1H], RS CVn binaries [\citep=2006A&A...454..295F] and other variables [\citep=2004A&A...428..925V] [\citep=2005ASPC..335..119V].

Sonneberg Photometry Pipeline

The studies mentioned in the previous section often used visual estimates to derive the magnitudes. Common tools were loupes, microscopes and iris diaphragma photometers. Some studies used custom-made digital extraction pipelines. All methods performed very similarly, with typical scatter of order 0.15 mag for individual measurements. A systematic digital analysis by [\citet=2004A&A...428..925V] (their section 3) yields scatter of [formula] mag depending on stellar brightness and location on the plate. This study is also very interesting as it asks "How many "constant" stars are in fact long-term variables?", and presents many figures, each comparing a constant reference star to a newly found variable, sometimes with decade-long periods. About 85% of randomly selected stars are found to be constant within their uncertainty of 0.1 mag per century.

In order to maximize robustness, we used an established pipeline to reduce the images, closely resembling the process of the APPLAUSE project in the digitization of the plate archives in Hamburg, Bamberg and Potsdam [\citep=2014aspl.conf..127T]. The plate negatives are first inverted and then cropped to the inner 90% area of the scanned images, in order to exclude the glass borders and annotations. Then, we perform an astrometric solution with the Astrometry.net software [\citep=2010AJ....139.1782L] using a list of coordinates of the brightest sources as an input and the Tycho-2 catalog as a reference. For our wide-field images [formula] we have a resolution of 17.5 arc seconds per scanned pixel, and the astrometric solution yields a global fit with errors of several pixels, due to lens distortions. Therefore, we split the image into mosaics of [formula] and re-run the astrometry software for each mosaic individually. Afterwards, the astrometric errors are much smaller than the pixel scale. Therefore, we do not further improve the astrometric solution through cross-calibration, which could be done by software packages like SCAMP [\citep=2006ASPC..351..112B]. Of course, pairs of stars with separations smaller than the pixel scale get blended. Our object of interest, KIC 8462852, is fortunately located so that its neighbour stars are always separated by several pixels, even in bad seeing and overexposed plates (Figure [\ref=fig:raw]). KIC 8462852 is almost always located within the inner [formula]% from the center of the plate. Due to some overlap in the Sonneberg Sky Patrol, there are further plates in the archive which are nominally taken at a different sky position, but have the star still on glass, mostly towards the corners or edges, and thus the star's imprint will suffer from astigmatism. An extensive search for such plates could be done in case of further interest, but is beyond the scope of this paper.

After obtaining star coordinates, we perform photometry using the SExtractor program [\citep=1996A&AS..117..393B] which identifies all sources above a specified brightness threshold. SExtractor works on scans of photographic plates as well as CCDs. In principle, the program could be calibrated with the specific response curve of the scanner used to digitize the plates, and to specific photographic emulsions. However, it has been shown that it is prefered not to do this, as each plate has slight individual differences. Instead, it is recommended to use the default configuration of SExtractor ("standard mode"). This results in a non-linear magnitude scale, which has to be corrected using a number of constant calibration stars in post-processing [\citep=2008AcA....58..279K] [\citep=2016arXiv160700312W]. We tried both methods, and got virtually identical results for stars of the same brightness, as expected. SExtractor offers several aperture settings, and we got the smallest scatter when using a constant circular aperture.

Then, we follow the procedure described in [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T] for the photometric calibration of the DASCH plates. Each plate is divided in sub-fields, and a series of nearby comparison stars (using catalog values) is used to calibrate each star. This is similar to what people do when examining the plates by eye: The target object is compared with neighbouring stars of similar magnitudes. Due to subtle changes over time, e.g. in emulsions, color sensitivity may change. This may introduce trends of a few tenths of a magnitude. It is crucial to have comparison stars as close in color to the program star as possible. By adding comparison stars of different colors one gets a synthetic comparison star with a mean color index of the stars. If the mean color index differs from the color index of the program star, then there will still be magnitude shifts with variations in the emulsion.

Therefore, we cannot blindly re-use the 8 comparison stars in [\citet=2016arXiv160801316M] and the 2 stars from [\citet=2016ApJ...822L..34S]. Instead, we use the Tycho-2 catalogue and select stars within 0.5mag in brightness from our program star, within 1 degree distance, and within 0.1 mag of color difference in Tycho-2 BT - VT. This gives a total of 39 comparison stars.

In each epoch, we create one artificial "reference star" from the mean magnitudes of these comparison stars. As we selected stars very similar in brightness and color, the overall mean difference between the program star and the reference star is very small, 0.01 mag. With this method, we obtain a differential magnitude for our program star for each epoch. As we are not interested in absolute magnitudes, we simply tie the mean magnitudes to the Tycho BT and VT magnitudes and calculate the difference for our program star. In the future, one might determine the color response of Sonneberg pg and pv and shift the magnitudes slightly for these colors. We estimate the differences between pg and BT, and between pv and BV, to be < 0.1mag.

The SExtractor solution of a single plate contains on average 120,000 identified sources, and usable photometry for 100,000 stars. After the calibration, the average standard deviation of KIC 8462852, compared to its mean magnitude, is 0.18mag per plate in pg and 0.2 mag in pv. These values are comparable to other studies using Sonneberg plates (section [\ref=sec:archive]), and photographic plates in general; e.g., [\citet=2010ApJS..187..275S]. The described procedure produces 1263 magnitudes from a total of 1645 plates. As a quality filter, we remove all magnitudes of KIC 8462852 where its calculated astrometric position is located outside of the star image, which is usually [formula] pixels. This removes 13 measurements, and eliminates the risk to mix up identifications. The remainder of 369 plates were rejected by SExtractor. Visual examination of 20 of the rejected plates showed that glass/emulsion defects and failure of star tracking were the most common issues. We have not attempted to recover these plates. We also decided against further quality cuts, such as measurements near the plate limit, and instead use all values including their (larger) uncertainties.

For reproducibility and independent re-analysis, we make the relevant raw photometry open source.

Results

In the following sections, we discuss photometry from different sources. Most magnitudes are reported in B, however these have different zeropoints due to the different use of filters and photographic emulsions. Unless otherwise noted, we have not modified the magnitudes, but left them as reported in the given sources. That is, we do not focus on absolute brightness comparisons, but on relative changes for each set of observations individually.

Lightcurve with Sonneberg data

We show the Sonneberg data for KIC 8462852 in Figure [\ref=fig:sonne_phot]. At first glance, one prominent outlier in pv is obvious for the year 1977.92. The results remain unchanged within the errors if this point is removed, therefore we kept it as is. We fit least-squares regressions to the data separately and get [formula] mag/century (n = 862) for pg and [formula] mag/century for pv (n = 401). Then, we merge both colors by subtracting their zeropoints, and get a slope of [formula] mag/century (n = 1263). The results remain virtually identical with and without accounting for individual data point uncertainties, usually around 0.18 mag per plate in pg and 0.2 mag in pv as reported by SExtractor.

This result is consistent with no dimming of the star between 1934 and 1995. We can test the hypothesis of a trend of 0.164mag/century using a t-test (or F-test) for the Î²-parameter (slope) of the regression. The result indicates that a slope of 0.164 mag/century is in disagreement with the data by 4.9Ï (F = 25.07,p < 0.0001). The discrepancy with the claimed dimming is visually obvious when plotting the hypothetical linear trend (compare Figure [\ref=fig:sonne_sonne_comp], right panel).

We checked the 39 comparison stars and found that several exhibit traces of variability, but these effects cancel out in the "masterflat" due to the large number of comparison stars. We show examples of comparison stars in the appendix (section [\ref=sec:appendix]).

We tested the Sonneberg photometry for normality and found strong statistical evidence for a non-Gaussian distribution. We repeated our tests using robust regressions, and get the same results within the errors.

We binned the data yearly to examine possible fluctuations on shorter timescales. The result is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:sonne_sonne_comp] (left panel). Most years are consistent with no deviation from the mean flux. We see a dip in pg for the years 1937-1939 (0.1 mag) and 1950-1953 (0.15 mag), but have no pv data for these years to confirm an astrophysical origin. The DASCH data for both intervals is consistent with no dips, so that we must assume a systematic error. For the years 1976-1978, we see a brightening in pv, but nominal flux in pg (and DASCH). The yearly binned pv magnitude for 1977 is strongly influenced by an outlier at 1977.92.

The Sonneberg data samples the 1960s well, the time of the "Menzel gap" in DASCH data. Using Sonneberg data, we find yearly binned standard deviations from the mean to be < 0.1 mag in pg for each year in the 1960s, and to < 0.12 mag in pv for all available years after 1962, consistent with no dimming in this decade.

Also, most other years are within 0.1 mag of the mean. Of course, a difference of 0.1 mag corresponds to a brightness variation of [formula], so that any year-on-year fluctuation below 10% is within the noise. Therefore, year-long trends of 3% as reported by [\citet=2016arXiv160801316M] are consistent with, and invisible in, the Sonneberg data.

Lightcurve with APPLAUSE data

The APPLAUSE project digitizes photographic plates in the archives of Hamburg, Bamberg and Potsdam observatories [\citep=2014aspl.conf...53G] [\citep=2014aspl.conf..127T]. The plates are digitized with high-resolution flatbed scanners. As of August 2016, 42,789 plates have been scanned and reduced. These data have been used e.g. in a study on the historic long-term variability of active galaxies [\citep=2016arXiv160700312W]. We have extracted the magnitudes for KIC 8462852 using the public web interface. A first analysis showed a correlation of the star's brightness with its position on the plate, which will be corrected in the next data release. For KIC 8462852, this accounts for 0.15mag extra scatter. We have reduced the scatter by subtracting the mean magnitude of the annular bin (there are 8 annular bins). For a least-squares linear regression, this is irrelevant, as it does not change the slope of the fit. The result is a dimming of [formula] mag/century, inconsistent with all other data from Harvard, Sonneberg and Pulkovo (Figure [\ref=fig:photocomp], middle).

The slope in the APPLAUSE light curve is strongly affected by the data points from 1938-1939. These data originate from a telescope at the Hamburg Observatory that has strong coma effect in the images. The other data points come from three other telescopes. The APPLAUSE data is heterogeneous, with various telescopes and a wide range of emulsions and exposure times used, so calibration is an issue. Also, photometry has been calibrated globally, without choosing local comparison stars for KIC 8462852. Such calibrations might be performed in a future data release. At the moment, however, the APPLAUSE data suffers from large systematics in the case of KIC 8462852 and cannot be used for an individual analysis.

Lightcurve with Pulkovo data

Pulkovo observatory is the main astronomical observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, located outside of St. Petersburg. It was founded in 1839 and the regular photographic observations were started at in 1894. The collection today contains 50,000 plates [\citep=2002rict.confE..22K]. The plates were measured using the "Ascorecord" machine with visual pointing, the "Fantasy" automatic complex [\citep=1989WisZe..38...28G], and the UMAX scanner (600 ppi) [\citep=2016AstL...42...41I]. In 2010, the measurement and calibration technique for wide fields digitized by the scanner Microtec (3200 ppi) was developed. About 2000 plates with asteroids observations were digitized and measured [\citep=2011gfun.conf..131K]. These data were used for e.g. studies on Pluto [\citep=2013arXiv1310.7502K]. The plates were taken with the "Normal Astrograph", D/F=330 mm/3467 mm, between 1922 and 2001. The plates emulsion had maximum of sensitivity close to band B (440-450 nm). For KIC 8462852, we decided to use a digital camera for plate digitization. The plate digitization and calibration process is described in [\citep=2016AstL...42...41I] and used 9 nearby stars for calibration. The average standard deviation from the mean is 0.13mag. A least-squares regression yields [formula]mag/century (Figure [\ref=fig:photocomp], bottom). Due to the low number of data points, any one point already changes the result significantly. Therefore, the Pulkovo data cannot be used for an individual analysis of KIC 8462852.

Lightcurve with DASCH data

These data were discussed extensively in [\citet=2016ApJ...825...73H]. For comparison, we show all APASS data without quality cuts, resulting in a slope of 0.12 instead of 0.16 as claimed by [\citet=2016ApJ...822L..34S] (Figure [\ref=fig:photocomp], top).

Period search

[\citet=2016MNRAS.457.3988B] discuss several periodic signals (their section 2.1). The rotation period of the star is found to be 0.88d [\citep=2016MNRAS.457.3988B], although this period has been claimed to originate from a different, nearby star [\citep=2016arXiv160904032M]. From the separation of dips, a possible period of a circumstellar body is identified, at 48.4 or 48.8d (or half this value). Finally, the largest dips are separated by 726d. In order to search for such periodicities in our historic data, we combined all photometry, and normalized the flux values per observatory by their median. Each measurement (plate) received the same weight.

For sinusoidal trends, such as the rotation signal, the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram is most sensitive. It is the generalized form of the Fourier transforms and handles gaps in the data without introducing spurious power [\citep=1982ApJ...263..835S] [\citep=1986ApJ...302..757H] [\citep=2009A&A...496..577Z]. For transit-like events, the Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm [\citep=2002A&A...391..369K] is more suitable. It fits the input time series to periodic "box"-shaped functions, rather than decomposing it into sinusoids. The BLS has been run for periods up to 50 years, and transit durations between 1 hour and 10 days.

Both methods, LS and BLS, we find only peaks that are yearly aliases, and a few caused by single outliers. When these are ignored, no significant peaks remain. We tested the sensitivity to a 48.8d transit signal through injection and retrieval. We find that a 10% dip of 1-day length, repeating regularly every 48.8d, would have been detected with > 3Ï confidence. Consequently, we can constraint transits to < 10% in depth for periods < 50d. For 726-day signals, we cannot give useful upper limits due to insufficient data caused by many gaps.

Discussion

If we take the results of constant flux (witin 10% per year) at face value, it is still possible that the star undergoes periodic changes in brightness of a few percent. Our own Sun changes luminosity by [formula] [\citep=1998A&A...335..709F] over the 11-year solar cycle [\citep=1843AN.....20..283S] [\citep=1861MNRAS..21...77W] [\citep=2009ApJ...700L.154U], so that a brightness variation of [formula] over a few years, as reported by [\citet=2016arXiv160801316M], seems plausible. Without a century-long dimming, the main mystery can then focus on the day-long dips as described in [\citet=2016MNRAS.457.3988B]. The recently published "Families of plausible solutions" [\citep=2016ApJ...829L...3W] can provide a useful framework to identify the correct cause; a detailed discussion, however, is beyond the scope of this paper.

Conclusion

We have analyzed photometry from the Sonneberg observatory, and other sources, and found strong evidence that KIC 8462852 has not dimmed, but kept a constant flux over the last century. Yearly variations are found to be less than 10%. We found no evidence for any periodicity, neither sinusoidal, nor transit-like.
