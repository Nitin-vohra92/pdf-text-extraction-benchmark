Hadwiger's conjecture: finite vs infinite graphs

Definitions

In this note we are only concerned with simple undirected graphs G  =  (V,E) where V is a set and E  ⊆  P2(V) where

[formula]

We denote the vertex set of a graph G by V(G) and the edge set by E(G). Moreover, for any cardinal α we denote the complete graph on α points by Kα.

For any graph G, disjoint subsets S,T  ⊆  V(G) are said to be connected to each other if there are s∈S,t∈T with {s,t}∈E(G).

Given a collection D of pairwise disjoint, nonempty, connected subsets of V, we associated with D a graph G(D) with vertex set D and

[formula]

We say that a graph M is a minor of a graph G if there is a collection D of pairwise disjoint, nonempty, connected subsets of V and an injective graph homomorphism f:M  →  G(D).

This implies that Kα is a minor of a graph G if and only if there is a collection {Sβ:β∈α} of nonempty, connected and pairwise disjoint subsets of V(G) such that for all β,γ∈α with β  ≠  γ the sets Sβ and Sγ are connected to each other.

Different statements of Hadwiger's conjecture

The statement of Hadwiger's conjecture that is usually found in the literature is the following:

(H): If G is a simple undirected graph and λ  =  χ(G) then the complete graph Kλ is a minor of G.

The next version of Hadwiger's statement has a bit of a different flavor, and we will compare it to (H) in the finite and infinite contexts in the following sections.

(ModH): For every graph G there is a minor M of G such that

[formula], and

χ(M)  =  χ(G).

There is a version of (ModH) that has appears to be similar, but we will see later that it is worthwhile to look at the statement separately.

(HomH): For every graph G there is a minor M of G such that

[formula], and

there is a graph homomorphism f:G  →  M.

Last, the following weaker version of this was studied in [\cite=me]:

(WeakH): Whenever λ is a cardinal such that there is no graph homomorphism c:G  →  Kλ then Kλ is a minor of G.

The finite case

Overview:

(H) is a long-standing open problem.

(ModH) is equivalent to (H) for finite graphs (see proposition [\ref=fin]).

(HomH) is also equivalent to (H) for finite graphs.

(WeakH) is implied by (H).

For finite graphs G, the statements (H) and (ModH) are equivalent.

Given a finite non-complete graph G = (V,E), the statement (H) implies that K = Kχ(G) is a minor of G. Since K is complete, but not G, they are not isomorphic, so (ModH) holds.

For the other implication, take any finite graph G and let n = χ(G). Use (ModH) to get a proper minor M1 such that χ(M1) = n. If M1 is complete, we have proved (H), otherwise use (ModH) again to find a proper minor M2 of M1 with χ(M2) = n, and so on. Since G is finite, this procedure is bound to end at some Mk for some [formula], which implies that Mk is complete and has n points.

It is easy to modify Proposition [\ref=fin] to see that in the finite case, (H) and (HomH) are equivalent.

In the finite setting, the statement (WeakH) amounts to saying that if χ(G) = t > 0 then Kt - 1 is a minor of G. This is weaker than (H); whether it is strictly weaker is an open question (see section [\ref=open]).

The infinite case

Infnite chromatic number

Overview:

(H) is false: Let G be the disjoint union of all [formula]. Then χ(G) = ω, but Kω is not a minor of G.

(ModH) is true, see proposition [\ref=propinf].

(HomH) is open.

(WeakH) is true, see [\cite=me].

So that is why we sepatately introduced (HomH) in addition to (ModH): they might be different for graphs with infinite chromatic number.

For graphs with infinite chromatic number, (ModH) is true.

Let I be the set of isolated vertices of G.

Case 1. [formula]. We set [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] as M contains no isolated points. Since [formula] we have χ(M) = χ(G).

Case 2. [formula]. Fix v0∈V(G). Let M = (V(G),E) where

[formula]

that is we remove all edges connecting v0 to some other vertex in V(G). Since M has v0 as an isolated point, but G has no isolated points, we have [formula], and it is easy to verify that χ(M) = χ(G).

Finite chromatic number

For infinite graphs with finite chromatic number we get the following results:

It is not known whether (H) and (WeakH) are true;

(ModH) is true: the theorem of De Bruijn and Erds [\cite=DeBE] implies that if G is infinite with finite chromatic number, there is a finite subgraph M of G with χ(M)  =  χ(G).

(HomH) is true for the same reason (note that a coloring is always a graph homomorphism to a complete graph).

Open questions

Question 1. Does the weak Hadwiger conjecture (WeakH) hold for finite graphs?

(WeakH) might be as elusive has (H) has been so far; so here is a different problem:

Question 2. When we restrict ourselves to finite graphs, does the weak Hadwiger conjecture (WeakH) imply the statement of the Hadwiger conjecture?

The next question is a stronger version of (ModH) and focuses on finite graphs.

Question 3. Suppose that G is a finite, connected graph such that whenever you contract 1 edge or 2 edges, the chromatic number decreases. Does this imply G is complete?

Finally we turn to infinite graphs:

Question 4. Does (WeakH) hold for infinite graphs with finite chromatic number?

Question 5. Does (HomH) hold for graphs with infinite chromatic number?
