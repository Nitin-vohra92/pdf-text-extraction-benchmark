Introduction

In the framework of Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM), galaxies form at the centres of dark matter haloes [\citep=Silk12] [\citep=Somerville15]. The ratio of galaxy stellar mass to halo mass has an absolute maximum from the cosmic baryon fraction (fb  ~  0.16; [\citealt=Planck15]). In practice, stellar feedback processes limit the maximum ratio to ~  30% for a [\cite=Salpeter55] initial mass function [\citep=moster-09] [\citep=Moster12] [\citep=Behroozi10] [\citep=BWC13]. At z < 4, this maximum ratio is never achieved for massive haloes ([formula]), due to inefficient cooling [\citep=Lu11b] and feedback from supermassive black holes [\citep=Silk98]. At z > 4, however, comparisons of galaxy and halo number densities suggest that massive haloes can indeed reach close to 30% integrated efficiency in converting baryons into stars [\citep=BWC13] [\citep=BehrooziHighZ] [\citep=Finkelstein15] [\citep=Sun16].

Conversely, an observed galaxy mass ([formula]) places a lower limit on its host halo mass (Mh). ΛCDM alone implies that [formula], and known baryonic physics would give a more stringent limit of [formula]. This fact has been used in [\cite=Steinhardt16] to argue that galaxy number densities at [formula] are inconsistent with ΛCDM. While we disagree with their assumptions (especially that the [formula] ratio cannot increase at z > 4) and therefore also their conclusions, the basic principle that galaxy number densities constrain halo number densities is well-established.

In this paper, we apply the maximum achievable [formula] ratios to halo mass functions to calculate physically interesting thresholds for observed stellar masses. As galaxy number densities are consistent with halo number densities for redshifts z < 8 [\citep=BWC13], we compute galaxy masses that would imply departures from currently-known baryonic physics or from ΛCDM over 8 < z < 20, observable with future infrared space-based telescopes (e.g., JWST, the James Webb Space Telescope, and WFIRST, the Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope).

Similarly, interesting physical thresholds can be calculated for supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Constraints on SMBH mass ([formula]) at z = 0 suggest a maximum [formula] ratio of 2% for non-satellite galaxies [\citep=Thomas16]; and the highest median relation for the [formula] ratio at z = 0 [\citep=Kormendy13] gives ~  0.5% for [formula]. The observed number density of high-z quasars gives a limit on the largest possible host halo mass in ΛCDM [\citep=Haiman01], which in turn limits the highest possible host galaxy mass (via [formula]). Hence, given the number density of black holes of a given mass, we can derive a lower limit for their [formula] ratios without requiring difficult observations of the host galaxy.

Throughout, we assume a flat, ΛCDM cosmology with ΩM  =  0.309, Ωb  =  0.0486, σ8 = 0.816, h = 0.678, ns  =  0.967, corresponding to the best-fit Planck cosmology [\citep=Planck15]. For halo masses, we use the virial overdensity definition of [\cite=mvir_conv].

Methodology

We adopt cumulative halo mass functions (Φh) from [\cite=BWC13] and define two maximum cumulative galaxy mass functions, both functions of redshift:

[formula]

If the observed cumulative number density of galaxies ([formula]) exceeds [formula], it rules out our adopted [formula]CDM model (provided that the observations are correct). Likewise, if [formula] exceeds [formula], it could imply either that our understanding of stellar feedback is incorrect or that our adopted ΛCDM model is incorrect. As our understanding of stellar feedback is much less certain, we assume that [formula] exceeding [formula] but not [formula] most likely implies a deficit in our knowledge of stellar feedback.

Similarly, we define two cumulative supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass functions:

[formula]

If [formula] exceeds [formula], the observed black holes must have [formula] ratios of >  2% (assuming that galaxies do not exhibit new physics), potentially implying that unusual accretion physics grows the SMBH quickly relative to its host galaxy [\citep=Volonteri15] or that massive seeds had high initial [formula] ratios [\citep=Bromm03] [\citep=Banik16]. If [formula] exceeds [formula], then the SMBHs have [formula] ratios above the z = 0 median relation. Our choice of the highest z = 0 median relation makes the latter statement as conservative as possible--i.e., if [formula] is higher than [\cite=Kormendy13], then it will also be higher than all other determinations [\citep=Haring04] [\citep=McConnell13].

Results

Similar to CANDELS [\citep=Koekemoer11] [\citep=Grogin11] with Hubble, a future JWST survey may probe galaxy cumulative number densities down to nJ  ~  10- 6 Mpc- 3. WFIRST has a ~  100  ×   larger field of view, so it may reach cumulative number densities of nW  ~  10- 8 Mpc- 3. For these two threshold densities, we plot Φ- 1(n,z) (i.e., the stellar mass [formula] at which [formula]) for both [formula] and [formula] in Fig. [\ref=f:mass]. For comparison, we also plot observed cumulative number densities for galaxies at z = 8 from [\cite=Song15] and z = 11.1 from [\cite=Oesch16]. Neither observation approaches cumulative number densities of 10- 8 Mpc- 3, but that is not necessary--all galaxies with cumulative number densities greater than this threshold must still have stellar masses less than the values given by [formula] and [formula] to be consistent with ΛCDM and known stellar feedback physics, respectively. For arbitrary future surveys, Fig. [\ref=f:mass] also shows cumulative number density thresholds as a function of galaxy stellar mass from z = 4 to z = 20, including a comparison to the massive galaxy in [\cite=Stefanon15]. If this galaxy's reported stellar mass and redshift were correct (z = 5.4 and [formula] after conversion to a [\citealt=Salpeter55] IMF), it would require turning > 30% of the baryons in its host halo into stars; however, both measurements have significant uncertainties (§ [\ref=s:conclusions]). Finally, we calculate limits using a cumulative number density n(z) such that only one object should exist in a volume 20  ×   greater than the volume of the observable Universe over a redshift range z - 0.5 to z + 0.5; these volumes are potentially accessible with all-sky surveys like SPHEREX [\citep=Dore14]. Finding a single galaxy above the black threshold in Fig. [\ref=f:mass] (bottom-left panel)--e.g., a [formula] galaxy at z = 13--would rule out the adopted ΛCDM model with 95% confidence in the absence of other priors and observations at other redshifts.

Threshold masses for black holes are shown in Fig. [\ref=f:mass_bh] and compared to the most massive known quasars at z > 5 [\citep=Jiang07] [\citep=Willott10] [\citep=DeRosa11] [\citep=Mortlock11b] [\citep=Wu15] [\citep=Wang15c]. As bright quasars are detectable in large-area photometric surveys (e.g., the SDSS, [\citealt=SDSSQ], and the CFHQS, [\citealt=Willott07]), we calculate mass thresholds at cumulative number densities of 10- 9.5 Mpc- 3 and 10- 11 Mpc- 3. Provided their mass estimates are correct, all referenced quasars exceed the highest median z = 0 [formula] ratios [\citep=Kormendy13]. Two quasars, SDSS J1044-  0125 [\citep=Jiang07] and SDSS J010013.02+  280225.8 [\citep=Wu15] have minimum [formula] ratios equalling the 2% ratio found for NGC 1600 [\citep=Thomas16].

Discussion and Conclusions

Aforementioned "other priors" significantly limit any naive attempt to rule out ΛCDM with galaxy masses. First are uncertainties in converting luminosity to stellar mass [\citep=Conroy09] [\citep=Behroozi10]; besides systematic offsets, these also induce Eddington bias [\citep=Eddington13] that artificially inflates the number densities of massive galaxies [\citep=Behroozi10] [\citep=Caputi11] [\citep=Grazian15]. Also present are uncertainties in photo-z codes and priors; improperly chosen, the latter can similarly inflate massive galaxy counts [\citep=Stefanon15]. Just as problematic are multiple peaks in the posterior distribution of z, as for the massive galaxy in [\cite=Stefanon15]. Finally, we note the relatively high lensing optical depth at z > 8, which further boosts the apparent number of massive galaxies [\citep=Mason15].

Black hole masses are also subject to many uncertainties [\citep=Peterson14], and virial masses in particular may be overestimates [\citep=Shankar16]. Selecting the largest black holes from a sample with uncertain masses also imposes Eddington bias. Nonetheless, our limits agree with other approaches that infer large black hole mass -- stellar mass ratios [\citep=Targett12] [\citep=Venemans16], which are expected due to selecting for luminous, massive black holes [\citep=Lauer07] [\citep=Volonteri11].

Even so, it is exciting that the highest stellar masses observed in Fig. [\ref=f:mass] are so close to the limits expected for ΛCDM. This suggests that high-redshift galaxy surveys will give independent checks on the evolution of the halo mass function at z > 8, which is otherwise very difficult to measure. Combined with constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities and dark matter from faint galaxies [\citep=Habouzit14] [\citep=Governato15], JWST and WFIRST will place very interesting limits on early Universe cosmology.

For SMBHs, [formula]2% has been claimed at z = 0 [\citep=Walsh16], but only for satellite galaxies whose masses have likely been reduced by tidal stripping [\citep=Barber16]. Direct observation of the quasar host galaxies, if possible, would likely place them at ratios similar to the highest known at z > 0 [\citep=Trakhtenbrot15]. Fig. [\ref=f:mass_bh] provides a simple estimate of whether a given [formula] requires an anomalously high [formula] ratio, potentially bolstering the case for follow-up observations.

Finally, we cite examples of "unusual" physics that could be invoked if future observations cross the thresholds outlined here. We refer to ideas beyond usual prescriptions for supernova feedback and AGN (active galactic nuclei) quenching that limit star formation in current cosmological and zoom-in simulations. Specifically, we mention positive feedback from AGN (as a precursor to the negative feedback observed via AGN-driven massive gas outflows; [\citealt=Gaibler12] [\citealt=Ishibashi12] [\citealt=Silk13] [\citealt=Wagner16], examples of which are beginning to be found [\citep=Zinn13] [\citep=Cresci15] [\citep=Salome15], and a significant duty cycle of hyper-Eddington accretion, increasingly invoked to solve SMBH growth problems at high redshift [\citep=Jiang14] [\citep=Volonteri15] [\citep=Inayoshi16].
