Evidence for a systematic offset of -  0.25 mas in Gaia DR1 parallaxes at [formula] mas

Introduction

The advent of trigonometric parallaxes for ~  109 stars from the Gaia mission promises to revolutionize many areas of stellar and Galactic astrophysics, including exoplanet science. For example, with eventual expected precision in the parallax of ≈  20 μas for bright exoplanet host stars, it should be possible to determine the stellar and planet radii and masses directly and empirically with accuracies of 3-5% [\citep=Stassun:2016b]. Already, the Gaia first data release [\citep=Gaia:2016] provides parallaxes for ~  2 million Tycho-2 stars (the TGAS stars) with a nominal precision of ≈  0.3 mas and with a quoted systematic uncertainty at present of 0.3 mas.

The results from DR1 are based on only 14 months of observations, and use external information in the form of earlier positions from the Hipparcos [\citep=ESA:1997] [\citep=vanLeeuwen:2007] and Tycho-2 [\citep=Hog:2000] catalogs to help remove degeneracies [\citep=Michalik:2015]. Additionally, they rely on very provisional and as yet incomplete calibrations, and as a result the astrometric products including the parallaxes are still preliminary. Nonetheless, the new parallaxes represent such an improvement in both quality and quantity that they are certain to be used by the community for a wide range of astrophysical applications, at least until future Gaia releases supersede them.

It is essential, therefore, to assess the on-sky delivered performance of these parallaxes from Gaia DR1, especially the presence of any unexpected biases. This is particularly important in light of the experience from Hipparcos, which suffered a significant bias in at least the case of the Pleiades cluster [\citep=Pinsonneault:1998]. Such a check requires a set of benchmark stars whose parallaxes are determined independently and with an accuracy that is at least as good as that expected from Gaia DR1.

[\citet=Stassun:2016] assembled a sample of 158 eclipsing binary stars (EBs) whose radii and effective temperatures are known empirically and precisely, such that their bolometric luminosities are determined to high precision (via the Stefan-Boltzmann relation) and therefore independent of assumed distance. [\citet=Stassun:2016] reported new, accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes for these EBs which, together with the precisely known bolometric luminosities, yields a highly precise distance (or parallax).

The precision of the parallaxes for this EB sample was predicted by [\citet=Stassun:2016] to be ≈  190 μas on average. This is a factor of ~  2 better than the median precision of 320 μas for Gaia DR1 [\citep=Gaia:2016]. It is even somewhat superior to the expected Gaia precision floor of 240 μas. These EB parallaxes can therefore readily serve as distance benchmarks for the trigonometric parallaxes reported by Gaia DR1, and in particular can be used to assess the presence of any systematics.

In this Letter, we report the results of testing Gaia DR1 parallaxes against the [\citet=Stassun:2016] EB benchmark sample. Section [\ref=sec:data] describes the EB and Gaia data used. Section [\ref=sec:results] presents the key result of a systematic offset in the Gaia parallaxes relative to the EB sample. Section [\ref=sec:disc] considers potential trends in the parallax offset with other parameters. Section [\ref=sec:summary] concludes with a brief summary of our conclusions.

Data

We adopted the predicted parallaxes for the 158 EBs included in the study of [\citet=Stassun:2016]. Of these, 116 had parallaxes available in the Gaia first data release. We excluded from our analysis any EBs identified as potentially problematic in [\citet=Stassun:2016] or for which the Gaia measurement had σπ  >  π. This left 108 EBs with good parallaxes from both the EB analysis and from Gaia. These EBs are all relatively nearby, with parallaxes in the range π  ≈   0.5-30 mas. The EBs and their relevant data are provided in Table [\ref=tab:data].

Results

Figure [\ref=fig:delta_plx_hist] presents the overall distribution of parallax differences in the sense of πGaia  -  πEB. The distribution appears roughly symmetric and normally distributed, but with a clear offset relative to zero. The mean offset is Δπ  =   - 0.269  ±  0.051 mas, where the quoted error is the uncertainty of the mean for 108 measurements.

[\citet=Stassun:2016] noted that a number of the EBs used in that study are known triple or quadruple systems. In general these companions contribute very little to the total system light, and [\citet=Stassun:2016] found no evidence for significant systematics in their predicted parallaxes. Nonetheless, the offset that we find above for the Gaia parallaxes is small and could potentially have gone unnoticed in [\citet=Stassun:2016]. Indeed, the effect of additional light contribution to the EBs by companions would be in the sense of making the EB stars appear brighter, therefore inferred to be closer, and in turn the Gaia distances interpreted as too long (parallax too small).

In Gaia DR1, 12 of our EBs have known companions (see Table [\ref=tab:data]; one additional EB with a known companion is already excluded by the cuts discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:data]). These EBs are indicated in blue in Fig. [\ref=fig:delta_plx_hist], which shows the two largest outliers to be triples. Excluding all of the triples results in a parallax offset of Δπ  =   - 0.239  ±  0.047 mas, consistent with that determined for the full sample, though slightly smaller.

Overall, from the EB sample, a systematic offset in the Gaia DR1 parallaxes of - 0.24 to - 0.27 mas is indicated. For simplicity, we adopt the rounded value between these estimates of - 0.25  ±  0.05 mas.

Discussion

The official Gaia DR1 documentation states: "There are colour dependent and spatially correlated systematic errors at the level of ±  0.2 mas. Over large spatial scales, the parallax zero-point variations reach an amplitude of ±  0.3 mas.... Furthermore, averaging parallaxes over small regions of the sky will not reduce the uncertainty on the mean below the 0.3 mas level."

Our finding of a mean parallax offset of Δπ  ≈   - 0.25  ±  0.05 mas (Sec. [\ref=sec:results]; Fig. [\ref=fig:delta_plx_hist]) corroborates this statement, and further quantifies it precisely using an independent benchmark sample of EBs with accurately known distances [\citep=Stassun:2016]. Aside from this systematic offset, the Δπ differences appear to be distributed roughly as expected considering random error contributions from both the Gaia and EB parallax measurements (see Fig. [\ref=fig:delta_plx_hist]). Nonetheless, it is also possible in principle that the parallax offset we observe is not simply a global offset but rather a function of one or more parameters. We have considered some obvious possible parameters, including distance, brightness, and color. These are represented in Figure [\ref=fig:delta_vs_eb_plx], where we have used the EB effective temperature as a proxy for color.

There is weak evidence for a dependence of Δπ with color/Teff. The best fitting unweighted regression relation is Δπ  ≈   - 1.41 + 0.29  ×   log 10Teff mas, but with a coefficient of determination R2  =  0.12; this parameter explains only 12% of the variance in Δπ. There is stronger evidence for a dependence of Δπ on distance and/or brightness, the best fitting unweighted regression relations being Δπ  ≈   - 0.07 - 0.36  ×   log 10π mas (R2  =  0.19) and Δπ  ≈   - 0.90 + 0.07  ×  V mas (R2  =  0.27), respectively. It is difficult to gauge from the plots alone whether these modest distance and brightness dependencies are independent of one another. However, a Kendall's τ non-parametric correlation test clearly prefers the dependence on distance: The correlation with V has only 75.5% confidence whereas the correlation with distance is significant with 99.7% confidence.

Therefore, we refit the correlation with distance, this time weighted using the EB and Gaia parallax uncertainties in quadrature. The resulting best fitting relation is [formula] mas, where the quantities in parentheses are the formal uncertainties on the fit coefficients. We emphasize that the offset given by this relation is the offset in the Gaia DR1 parallaxes relative to the EB scale, thus this (negative) offset must be subtracted from the Gaia parallax to place the Gaia parallax on the EB scale.

If indeed the parallax offset is a function of distance as suggested above, we note that the offset becomes statistically insignificant for π  <  0.8 mas and vanishes at π  ≈  0.5 mas. This is consistent with the findings of [\citet=Casertano:2016], who find good agreement in the Gaia DR1 parallaxes among a sample of much more distant Cepheids. They also find evidence for an offset in the parallaxes in the near field among the small number of very nearby, bright Cepheids in their sample.

Finally, we have considered the possible spatial dependence of Δπ (Fig. [\ref=fig:map]). However no apparent trends emerge within the spatial coverage of the EB sample considered here, in either equatorial or ecliptic coordinates.

We point out also that the EB distances are based on stellar parameters (radii, temperatures) determined independently by many authors, and are therefore completely uncorrelated. As a result, we do not expect the EB parallaxes to be affected by any significant zero-point shifts with a sample as large as the one used here.

Summary and Conclusions

Here we present evidence of a small but systematic offset in the average zero-point of the parallax measurements recently released by the Gaia Mission of about - 0.25  ±  0.05 mas, in the sense that the Gaia values are too small. There is also evidence that the offset depends on stellar distance, according roughly to the relation [formula] mas. To apply the correction, this (negative) offset must be subtracted from the reported Gaia DR1 parallaxes. At present the average offset and linear relation are statistically valid for relatively large parallaxes, [formula] mas.

The reference for this determination is a set of more than 100 independently inferred parallaxes from a benchmark sample of well-studied eclipsing binaries with a wide range of brightnesses and distributed over the entire sky. It is expected that future releases of the Gaia catalog will remove this small shift as the number of observations increases, calibrations are improved, and the astrometric solution transitions to a self-consistent global fit using only Gaia data, independent of external astrometric information. In the meantime, investigators using the parallax results from DR1 are encouraged to keep this source of systematic error in mind.
