Boosting Lyα and HII  λ1640 line fluxes from Population III galaxies: stochastic IMF sampling and departures from case-B

Introduction

The first generation of stars, so called Population III (Pop III; hereafter) stars, played an important role in setting up the 'initial conditions' for galaxy formation in our Universe: Pop III stars initiated Cosmic Reionization and deposited the first heavy elements into the interstellar (ISM) and intergalactic media (IGM). In addition, Pop III stars likely provided seeds for the formation of the massive black holes we observe today [\citep=Bromm2013] [\citep=Karlsson2013] [\citep=Greif2015]. All these processes, in detail, depend on the physical properties of Pop III stars, such as their mass, temperature, spin, and stellar evolution.

Most predictions of observational signatures of Pop III stars have focused on their spectral energy distribution (SED) [\citep=Schaerer2014]. One of the most important parameters affecting the SED is the stellar mass, since it strongly affects the stars' total and ionizing luminosities. Unfortunately, the mass of Pop III stars, as well as the initial mass function (IMF), is still uncertain. Early works focused on the study of very massive objects [\citep=Bromm2001] [\citep=Bromm2002] [\citep=Abel2002] [\citep=Schneider2002] [\citep=Schneider2003]. Although it is still possible to form stars with masses of a few hundreds of solar masses in current calculations [\citep=Omukai2002] [\citep=Mckee2008] [\citep=Kuiper2011] [\citep=Hirano2014], it is also likely to obtain low mass stars, sometimes of only a few tens of solar masses or less [\citep=Turk2009] [\citep=Stacy2010] [\citep=Greif2011] [\citep=Clark2011] [\citep=Stacy2012] [\citep=Stacy2014] [\citep=Susa2014] [\citep=Hirano2015] [\citep=Hosokawa2015]. The preference for masses less than [formula] M[formula] is consistent with abundance patterns found in extremely metal-poor stars [\citep=Umeda2005] [\citep=Chen2016], metal-poor Damped Lyman Alpha systems [\citep=Pettini2002] [\citep=Erni2006] and with the inferred number of pair instability supernovae [\citep=Heger2002] events [\citep=Tumlinson2004] [\citep=Tumlinson2006] [\citep=Karlsson2008] [\citep=Frebel2009] [\citep=Aoki2014] [\citep=Bennassuti2014] [\citep=Frebel2015].

Direct searches for Pop III stars/galaxies have mostly focused on detecting strong hydrogen Lyα and [formula] line emission [\citep=Schaerer2008] [\citep=Nagao2008], the latter being associated with the spectrum of massive Pop III stars [\citep=Tumlinson2000] [\citep=Tumlinson2001] [\citep=Bromm2001] [\citep=Malhotra2002] [\citep=Jimenez2006] [\citep=Johnson2009] [\citep=Raiter2010]. Interestingly, [\citet=Sobral2015] have recently reported on the discovery of a high-redshift galaxy with unusually large Lyα and [formula] line emission, which had led to speculation that we might have discovered a massive Pop III galaxy, although this is still a matter of intense debate [\citep=Pallottini2015] [\citep=Dijkstra2015] [\citep=Smidt2016] [\citep=Smith2016] [\citep=Visbal2016] [\citep=Xu2016].

In this work, we revisit calculations of the spectral signature of Population III galaxies. Our work differs from previous analyses in the following ways: (i) We allow for stellar populations with lower stellar mass limits than previous studies. This is motivated by the more recent theoretical and observational preferences for lower mass Pop III stars. (ii) We examine, for the first time, the effects of the stochastic sampling of the IMF to the photon flux and luminosities from Pop III stellar populations. As we will show, stochasticity effects can be significant, and they can be further amplified when departures from case-B recombination assumption are taken into account.

Our paper is structured as follows: In Section [\ref=sec:models] we show the calculations to model the stellar and nebular SEDs, and we also detail the method for the stochastic sampling of the IMF. We present and analyse our results in Section [\ref=sec:results], and we discuss them in Section [\ref=sec:discussion] before concluding in Section [\ref=sec:summary].

Stellar atmosphere, population and nebula models

In this section, we present the calculations that yield to the obtention of the final spectra. We compute stellar atmosphere SEDs in Section [\ref=sec:stars]. In Section [\ref=sec:pops] we construct several stellar populations accounting for various IMFs and the stochastic sampling of the IMF. In Section [\ref=sec:nebula] we include the nebula surrounding the stellar populations using the photoionization code Cloudy version 13.03 [\citep=Ferland2013].

Hereafter, we will refer to stellar populations containing low-mass Pop III stars when the upper limit of the IMF is [formula], and high-mass star populations for upper limits above this threshold.

Stellar atmosphere models

We use the code Tlusty v200 [\citep=Hubeny1995] for the creation of the stellar SEDs. This code performs radiative transfer calculations in stellar atmospheres allowing for line blanketing and non-LTE effects. The latter is of particular importance in very hot stars, where the radiative processes are dominant [\citep=Marigo2001] [\citep=Schaerer2002a] [\citep=Bromm2002] [\citep=Kubat2012] [\citep=Rydberg2013] [\citep=Lovekin2014]. The code considers a plane-parallel geometry, which is also a good approximation in our case, since Pop III stars have large masses and radii [\citep=Schaerer2002a] [\citep=Kubat2012].

In our calculations we only consider the stage when the stars reside in the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) and we do not account for stellar evolution. Several authors have studied the evolution of massive Pop III stars [\citep=Marigo2001] [\citep=SchaererPello2002] [\citep=Schaerer2003] [\citep=Inoue2011] [\citep=Kubat2012]. We have explicitly tested that our choice has little impact on our main conclusions. Due to the lack of metals, the effect of stellar winds for Pop III stars has been considered to be not important since the radiation pressure is thought to be very small [\citep=Marigo2001] [\citep=Kudritzki2002] [\citep=Marigo2003] [\citep=Schaerer2002a] [\citep=Krticka2006] [\citep=Krticka2009]. We therefore ignore stellar winds or mass ejections in the computations but we note that other authors are revisiting these processes, e.g.,[\cite=Vink2015]. We construct only hydrogen and helium non-rotating stars. Rotation may induce a strong metal mixing from the inner to the outer stellar layers, as well as ejection of material to the surrounding medium. This can strongly affect the predicted spectra during the evolution of the star, but these effects are expected to be smaller during the ZAMS. In addition, the effects of rotation depend on parameters, such as velocity and angular momentum, which are still not fully understood for the case of Pop III stars [\citep=Ekstrom2008] [\citep=Yoon2012] [\citep=Yoon2014] [\citep=Lau2014]. We assume an helium mass fraction of YHe = 0.24, which implies a fraction in number of 0.06, although we have tested that a number fraction of 0.10 does not produce significant differences.

We use stellar parameters for the mass range [formula] from [\cite=Kubat2012], who adopted values for the stellar mass, temperature and radius from the works of [\cite=Schaerer2002a] and [\cite=Marigo2001]. For the calculation of the stellar lifetime we have used the analytical expression in Table 6 of [\cite=Schaerer2002a], for the case of zero metallicity and no mass-loss stars. The values of these parameters are shown in Table [\ref=ta:starparams], where we also show the computed values for Q(HI), Q(HeII), Q(LW) and [formula]. These parameters denote the ionizing photon flux for hydrogen, singly-ionized helium, the photon flux in the Lyman Werner (LW; hereafter) band and the mean Lyman continuum photon energy in units of Rydbergs, respectively. Our photon flux values are in agreement with those by [\cite=Schaerer2002a]. We stress that the variation of the photon flux in the whole mass range for the case of He II (a factor ~  109) is much larger than those for hydrogen and the LW band (factors ~  104 and ~  103, respectively). This implies that the ionized helium emission is much more sensitive to the hardness of the spectra than that from hydrogen, as already noticed by [\cite=Schaerer2002a] [\cite=Schaerer2003].

Stellar population models

We compute a set of stellar populations considering different mass ranges and power law indexes for an IMF of the form

[formula]

where ξ(m) gives the number of stars with mass in the range m  ±    dm / 2, and α is the power law index considered. We use several upper mass limits and the values α = 0 and α = 2.35, which denote a top-heavy and Salpeter slope distributions, respectively. A detailed view of the parameters is presented in Table [\ref=ta:imfparams]. The name of each model denotes the IMF parameters, e.g., m9M50a2 meaning a population with lower and upper stellar mass limits of 9 and 50 M[formula], respectively, and Salpeter slope . We also show in the table the values of the mean Lyman continuum photon energy, in units of Rydbergs, wich will be important in following sections.

Stochastic sampling of the IMF

The stochastic sampling of the IMF has been shown to have a very important effect in cases where the deterministic IMF only allows a low number of massive stars (e.g., Salpeter slopes instead of flat IMFs), and in cases with low star formation rate or starbursts with a small total stellar mass [\citep=Cervino2000] [\citep=Bruzual2002] [\citep=Cervino2006] [\citep=Haas2010] [\citep=Fumagalli2011] [\citep=Forero-Romero2013] [\citep=DaSilva2014]. For simplicity we only consider here the sampling of the IMF although a more detailed stochastic treatment might also consider the sampling of stellar clustering [\citep=Fumagalli2011] [\citep=Clark2011b] [\citep=Eldridge2011] [\citep=Greif2011] [\citep=DaSilva2012] and stellar evolution. For the case of non metal free populations there are codes specially designed for such purposes, e.g., the publicly available software SLUG [\citep=DaSilva2012] [\citep=Krumholz2015].

Here we ignore the populations with an upper mass limit of 1000 M[formula] due to the large stellar 'mass gap' between 500 and 1000 M[formula] in our stellar models. To obtain the stochastic stellar populations, we proceed as follows: We draw stars from our IMFs using the inverse cumulative distribution function and we follow the same procedure as in the STOP-NEAREST method in SLUG [\citep=Krumholz2015] for sampling the total stellar mass (target mass; hereafter). Specifically, this method decides whether or not to include the star for which the target mass is exceeded, based on the absolute value of the difference between the target and the total masses; the star is included in the sample if the difference between the two masses when including the star is less than that without it. We consider a default target mass of 1000 M[formula] for each starburst but we also examine the values 100 and 10 000 M[formula] (we compare these numbers with the results from simulations in Section [\ref=sec:discussion]).

We assess the following two cases:

ZAMS phase: We compute different samples, considering different IMF parameters and target masses, containing 10 000 stochastic stellar populations each. We do not consider the effect of time, i.e., the populations are assumed to be at the ZAMS and do not evolve. We use our stellar sample in Table [\ref=ta:starparams] to compare the results with the deterministic calculation.

Temporal evolution: We repeat the above calculations to obtain samples but in this case we allow for any stellar mass within the population, which enables smoother evolution profiles of the distributions. We use a cubic interpolation of the values in Table [\ref=ta:starparams] to obtain the parameters for a given stellar mass. We assess the evolution in time in two ways: First, we study the evolution of galaxies considering only one burst of star formation. We compute the distributions at certain time steps considering only the stars that are still alive at that time. We repeat this procedure until all the stars in the galaxies have disappeared. Second, we follow the evolution of galaxies as before but we allow now periodic bursts of star formation.

Nebular models

In this section, we examine the contribution of the medium around the stellar populations to the final spectra. This region will shape the incident stellar radiation field and will yield a different outcoming spectrum [\citep=Schaerer2002a] [\citep=Schaerer2003] [\citep=Osterbrock2006] [\citep=Schaerer2008] [\citep=Raiter2010] [\citep=Inoue2010] [\citep=Inoue2011] [\citep=Schaerer2014].

We use the photoionization code Cloudy v13.03 [\citep=Ferland2013], which considers all relevant physical processes and allows us to avoid the use of, e.g., the usual case-B recombination assumption. Case-B is often used in calculations of HII regions but [\cite=Raiter2010] showed that significant departures from case-B can occur in very low metallicity environments. We will examine the case-B recombination assumption for our populations in Section [\ref=sec:caseb].

It is common to use black body spectra to characterize the stellar spectra incident on the nebula. However, black body spectrum does not reproduce the stellar spectra accurately and several corrections need to be done [\citep=Tumlinson2000] [\citep=Rauch2003] [\citep=Raiter2010] [\citep=Schaerer2014]. Therefore, we use our previously computed stellar population SEDs.

We assume, following [\cite=Schaerer2002a] [\cite=Raiter2010], that the escape fraction of ionizing photons is fesc = 0, and that the nebula surrounding the stellar population is a static, ionization bounded, spherically closed geometry with a constant density. If the escape fraction of ionizing photons is small, the variations to the luminosity and photon flux will also be small, almost null for the helium line flux [\citep=Schaerer2002a]. If the escape fraction is large, the calculations rapidly become much more complicated [\citep=Inoue2011], and taking into account proper radiative transfer codes and/or numerical simulations for the environment may be necessary. Given that the actual value of the escape fraction for Pop III populations is not well know, we do not explore more complex scenarios in this work. We explore a grid of models with different nebular parameters such as density, metallicity and ionization parameter, covering the parameter space used by [\cite=Raiter2010], who explored usual values found in HII regions. The values of these parameters are described in Table [\ref=ta:nebulaparams].

Results

In this section we present our main results, focusing on the differences between stellar populations for different IMF parameters in Section [\ref=sec:spectrum]. We only discuss about the differences for a variety of nebular parameters when this is relevant for our work; a detailed analysis can be found in [\cite=Raiter2010]. In Section [\ref=sec:caseb] we examine the departures from case-B and their origin, and in Section [\ref=sec:stoch] we explore the effects of the stochastic sampling of the IMF.

Spectrum of Pop III stellar populations

We find that populations with massive stars can give rise to significant emission of the Lyman series and HeII[formula] lines, due to their large stellar ionizing flux and high mean Lyman continuum photon energy (we will discuss about the importance of the mean Lyman continuum photon energy in Sections [\ref=sec:caseb] and [\ref=sec:stoch]). The luminosity in the LW band is also enhanced above the stellar values [\citep=Schaerer2002a] [\citep=Johnson2008]. High nebular hydrogen density and very low metallicities boost this behaviour in agreement with the results of [\cite=Raiter2010]. For the case of populations containing only stars of mass [formula], the LW and Lyman series line fluxes are fainter. More importantly, the HeII[formula] line is dramatically reduced, and its visibility over the continuum strongly depends on the metallicity and density of the nebula.

Case-B departures

In this section we first study the existence of departures from the case-B assumption in our populations, shown to be important in metal-free objects by [\cite=Raiter2010], and second, we revisit the origin of these departures.

We compute the luminosity for the Lyα and HeII[formula] lines assuming case-B recombination, and compare them with the output from Cloudy, always for our lowest metallicity value, [formula], since we expect the differences to be the largest in this case as shown by [\cite=Raiter2010]. For the same reason, we make use of the populations m50M1000a0 and m9M50a2, which present the two most extreme cases of stellar populations.

For the analytical case-B, we follow the assumptions and formalism in [\cite=Raiter2010] and we adopt for the nebula an electron density ne = 102  cm- 3 and an electron temperature Te = 30  000  K. This implies a conversion of ionizing photons into Lyα of ~  68%, and yields to the formulae [\citep=Schaerer2002a]

[formula]

[formula]

where Q(HI) and Q(HeII) are here the photon flux computed by Cloudy for comparative reasons.

The most important results for our further discussion can be summarized as: (i) case-B overestimates the values for the luminosity of the HeII[formula] line by a factor [formula] for the case of high nebular densities, nH = 102 - 103  cm- 3, and low ionization parameter,  log   U  =    -  4, for both populations. (ii) The values for the Lyα luminosity are underestimated by a factor [formula] for our high-mass stars population and [formula] for the low-mass stars one. These values closely match the mean Lyman continuum photon energy in units of 1 Rydberg [\citep=Raiter2010]. For high densities, nH = 102 - 103  cm- 3, the departures are slightly higher than for lower densities. These results are in very good agreement with those obtained originally by [\cite=Raiter2010].

As an explanation for the case-B departure of the Lyα radiation, [\cite=Raiter2010] proposed that the high temperatures in the ionized region of the nebula allow for the collisional excitations to populate the first excited state of the hydrogen atom. Then, ionization by low energy photons can occur from that level, thus boosting the emission of Lyα to larger values compared to case-B (which only accounts for photoionizations from the ground state). However, for the photoionization from the first excited state to occur, very large column densities for this state are necessary since the cross section of this transition is of the order [formula]. Having a non-negligible optical depth to photoionization from the n = 2 state may imply that the nebular region becomes optically thick in the HI fine structure lines [\citep=Dijkstra2016]

In order to revisit the processes governing the departures from case-B, we use the population m50M1000a0. The parameters for the nebula are  log   U  =    -  1, nH = 103  cm- 3 and [formula]. This set of parameters is the one favouring the largest differences between Cloudy and the analytical calculation. For this population, the mean Lyman continuum photon energy is 2.9 Ryd.

The left panel in Figure [\ref=fig:caseB] shows several parameters of the nebula as a function of depth (x-axis), where r denotes the distance into the nebula (which begins at rin = 1017  cm). Two regions besides [formula] pc are clearly visible, denoting the mostly ionized (left part) and mostly neutral (right part) nebular hydrogen regions. The populations for the 2s and 2p excited states (light blue and purple thin lines, respectively) appear to be ~  9 orders of magnitude below that of the ground state (red thin line) in the ionized region, and the difference is larger in the neutral part of the nebula. This difference is the same for the column densities (green and dark blue lines) and similar for the optical depth (yellow and black thick lines), due to differences in the cross-section of the ground and first excited states. This implies that the first excited state is very optically thin to ionizing radiation. The right panel denotes the processes contributing to the hydrogen ionization from Cloudy. In the ionized part, the electron temperature reaches very high values allowing for the collisional processes of ionization from the ground state to be important (red line), representing [formula] of the total ionization. The other ~  90% is due to photoionization from the ground state (green solid line). In the neutral part, secondary ionizations are the major mechanism (dotted light blue line), although the total ionization rate is now many orders of magnitude lower. In any case, photoionizations from the first excited state are negligible. Cloudy shows that ~  40% of the Lyα flux is due to collisionally excited Lyα cooling radiation. Therefore, we conclude that Lyα departures from case-B arise mainly due to collisional excitation and ionization of hydrogen atoms by energetic free electrons. In addition, there is contribution to the Lyα production from the collisional mixing between the 2s and 2p levels for the case of high density regions [\citep=Raiter2010], helium recombinations and secondary ionizations.

Stochastic IMF effects

We show the effects of the stochastic sampling of the IMF in the two following sections. We first present the results for bursts of star formation at the ZAMS in Section [\ref=sec:stochzams] and then the results regarding time evolution in Section [\ref=sec:stochtime]. With this stochasticity study accounting for time evolution we aim to provide a basic framework/intuition for extending our results to more general star formation histories. Our discussion focuses on the default target mass (total stellar mass) 1000 M[formula], although we also show and discuss the cases with target masses 100 and 10 000 M[formula].

ZAMS phase

We present the results for the samples containing 10 000 galaxies at the ZAMS, built using the stochastic IMF method described in Section [\ref=sec:stochmethod].

Figure [\ref=fig:Qdistr] shows the normalized distributions of ionizing and LW photon fluxes, relative to the deterministic values (vertical dashed lines), for several IMFs. As expected from previous studies, the stochastic effects are more important for those populations favoring the presence of a low number of massive stars with respect to the total number of stars in a burst, i.e., Salpeter slope, and for high upper mass limit IMFs. The distributions for helium present the broadest shapes ( >  1 order of magnitude below and a factor [formula]3 above the deterministic value for all IMFs except for the flat one). This is due to the strong dependence on the hardness of the spectra, which in turn, depends on the stellar mass distribution in the populations. For the case of hydrogen and LW, the distributions are much narrower since the photon flux in these cases is less sensitive to the stellar mass. The distributions of helium flux for the case of target mass 100 and 10 000 M[formula] reach a maximum value of ~  1 order of magnitude and less than a factor 2 above the deterministic values, respectively, denoting the sensitivity of the stochastic effects to the target mass. For hydrogen and the LW band, the differences compared to the default target mass are smaller but still significant.

We showed in Section [\ref=sec:caseb] that the departure of the Lyα luminosity from the case-B assumption depends on the hardness of the spectra, i.e., on the mean Lyman continuum photon energy. Therefore, stochasticity can further enhance this difference since the hardness of the spectra depends on the distribution of stellar masses. To quantify this effect, we calculate the stochastic distributions for Lyα and HeII[formula] luminosities with and without the case-B assumption. We use the IMFs m9M500a2 and m9M50a2 as representative for this calculation since they denote the cases where stochasticity has a very high and low effect, respectively. For the case-B calculations we adopt the same formalism as in Section [\ref=sec:caseb]. Due to the high computational cost of running 10 000 different stellar populations with Cloudy, for the non-case-B calculations we use the fitting formulae given by [\cite=Raiter2010] instead. This yields a value for the Lyα luminosity

[formula]

where LBα is the luminosity assuming case-B (Equation [\ref=eq:b]), Ē denotes the mean Lyman continuum photon energy in Rydbergs and coll accounts for the density effects. For simplicity, we consider a nebular density nH = 103  cm- 3 which yields to coll = 0.78 following equation (9) in [\cite=Raiter2010]. Small variations of the density give rise to a few percent variation in the total result [\citep=Raiter2010]. We assume, again for simplicity, that the ionization parameter is  log   U  =    -  4. This has no effect on Lyα but implies that case-B overestimates HeII[formula] emission by a factor [formula], due to the actual competition between H and HeII for ionizing photons in cases with low U [\citep=Stasinska1986] [\citep=Raiter2010]. We will simply use this value for computing the non case-B helium luminosity. We stress that this is an arbitrary selection and for other values of the ionization parameter and same density, the departures from case-B for the case of helium are almost null [\citep=Raiter2010].

Figure [\ref=fig:Ldistr] shows the results after these calculations for the default target mass 1000 M[formula], where the results assuming case-B are plotted in red. The vertical dashed lines show the deterministic values for the corresponding distributions. Left panels present the cases for m9M500a2 and right panels for m9M50a2. Upper panels show the results for Lyα and the lower panels those for HeII[formula]. We see that the HeII[formula] luminosity can be boosted by a factor of [formula] compared to the deterministic calculation in both populations. The case of Lyα is more interesting since the stochastic boost (a factor ~  3 for m9M500a2 and ~  1.5 for m9M50a2) can be added to the departure from case-B (a factor ~  2.5 in both cases). The joint effects may give rise up to a factor ~  8 and ~  3.5 for the respective IMFs compared to the common calculations that do not consider stochasticity and case-B departures. For the 100 M[formula] target mass, the total Lyα boost can reach a very large value (a factor ~  16 and ~  9 for the two IMFs, respectively) and roughly the same values for the case of helium just accounting for the stochastic effects. The distributions are much narrower for the case of the largest target mass. In this case, the total maximum boosts are hardly above factors of a few in all populations and transitions.

Temporal evolution

In this section, we discuss the results for the distribution of photon fluxes and luminosities taking into account time evolution for two cases: (i) A single burst of star formation, and (ii) allowing for periodic bursts. As before, we use the IMFs m9M500a2 and m9M50a2, which have very different sensitivity to stochastic effects, and add now m9M100a0 to investigate the effect of time to flat IMFs.

First, in Figure [\ref=fig:decay1000] we present the evolution of the distribution of photon fluxes considering a single burst of star formation for the default target stellar mass 1000 [formula]. The black solid lines show the deterministic calculations, which in general follow the peak of the stochastic distributions. The differences at later times exist because the stochastic case can only account for an integer number of stars while the deterministic approximation can take any real number. This can be seen in the last time step of the right panel, where the deterministic number of 9 M[formula] stars is lower than unity, so the stochastic distribution can never reach those flux values. As expected, the higher upper mass limit IMFs, and specially for the case of helium, present the broadest distributions which, in general for all transitions, tend to slightly broaden with time. This broadening is much more important for the flat IMF, which can reach the minimum value just when the massive stars begin to disappear. This is because in these cases the flat IMF has favored the formation of populations with predominantly massive stars. For the lowest target mass the distributions are much broader and the minimum value of the photon flux can be reached at early times for the same reason as explained above. For the largest target stellar mass the distributions are narrow and show small differences compared to the deterministic calculations.

Second, we show in Figure [\ref=fig:csfr1000_Myr_L] the same above distributions but allowing now for periodic bursts of star formation and for the case of Lyα and HeII[formula] luminosities. In this case, we create a new stochastic burst using a target mass of 1000 M[formula] every Myr, which represents an average star formation rate SFR  =  10- 3 M[formula]. We account for Lyα departures from case-B adopting the same formalism and values used for Equation [\ref=eq:lyab] in Section [\ref=sec:stochzams] and we assume that there are no departures from case-B for helium. Interestingly, the Lyα luminosity reaches high values, [formula], for the populations in the left and right panels, and a factor of [formula] below for the population in the middle panel. For the case of helium, the highest upper mass limit population in the left panel reaches a maximum value of L1640  ~  1039  erg  s -  1 due to the stochastic effects. This plot gives an intuition for the values of the luminosities associated with our models.

Our results can be extrapolated to other target masses and SFRs. Figure [\ref=fig:evo] shows examples of this for a single starburst after 1 Myr and continuous SFRs after 20 Myr. Note that for the case of a single starburst the values in Figure [\ref=fig:evo] and the ones for luminosity presented above only last for 2 - 3 Myr, while the most massive stars are still alive (Figure [\ref=fig:decay1000]). Figure [\ref=fig:evo] shows that when considering a target mass of 100 M[formula] or SFR  =  10 -  4 M[formula], the stochastic effects are larger but not enough to compensate for the reduced total stellar mass. On the other hand, for a target mass of 10 000 M[formula], the stochastic effects are small but the photon fluxes and luminosities are a factor of ~  6 - 9 above those for a target mass 1000 M[formula] due to the larger stellar mass. This implies luminosities as high as [formula] and [formula]. We have checked with a simple linear extrapolation of these fluxes that for higher SFR values the stochastic broadening disappears quickly after SFR[formula]. Only the stochastic effects for the IMF m9M500a2 are visible slightly further although never reaching the point SFR[formula].

In the next section, we discuss the factors that may increase or reduce the luminosity values that we have found and the possibility for a detection of Pop III populations.

Discussion

We discuss in this section the factors that can affect our results and the possibility for a detection of Pop III galaxies.

Our stellar populations cover the mass range [formula]. We adopted the lower mass limit accounting for the validity of the plane parallel assumption in our stellar atmosphere modelling. However, we have tested the inclusion of low mass stars in our stochastic calculations, simply taking the values of photon fluxes for stars down to [formula] in [\cite=Marigo2001]. This implies a broadening of the IMFs, i.e., an increase of the stellar mass range. The effect on the stochastic distributions is not very significant for the case of hydrogen photon flux and Lyα luminosities. It is important, however, for the HeII distributions due to their strong dependence on stellar masses. This can reduce the luminosities and photon fluxes of helium by factors ~  4 - 8, depending on the sensibility to the stochastic effects of the IMF considered.

For simplicity, we have used in our photo-ionization modelling a constant nebular hydrogen density. We note, however, that since we extend our calculations to large time scales, these density values might very well change; e.g., supernova feedback from the most massive stars, stellar winds, changes in the ionizing radiation field, etc. As mentioned before, high nebular densities favor high line luminosities, specially for helium lines, so a decrease of density due to the above processes would be accompanied by a decrease of luminosities at late times. This might be further considered in more detail making use of numerical simulations and radiative transfer codes which can engulf all the necessary physical processes.

We have explored the cases with average star formation rates SFR  =  10- 3 and SFR  =  10- 4 M[formula]. These values are in agreement with the simulations by, e.g., [\cite=Wise2012] [\cite=Wise2014], but these and other recent studies also allow for lower SFR. [\cite=Cen2016] argues that the episodic bursts of star formation in atomic cooling halos are of the order of one every 20  -  100 Myr, yielding [formula] M[formula] or less, depending on the target mass of the bursts. In these cases, the high luminosity and photon flux values that we have obtained would only be present for a few Myr, during the life of the most massive stars.

Pop III stars are usually thought to exist only at very high redshifts, z > 11 - 25, but various studies indicate that they can also form at much lower redshifts, up to [formula] [\citep=Scannapieco2003] [\citep=Salvadori2007] [\citep=Tornatore2007b] [\citep=Trenti2009] [\citep=Wise2012] [\citep=Maio2013] [\citep=Muratov2013] [\citep=Visbal2016]. Recent simulations by [\cite=Xu2016] find a non-negligible number of galaxies containing Pop III stars at [formula]. These stars reside in dark matter halos of masses [formula] and the total stellar mass covers the range from a few tens to ~  1000 M[formula], in agreement with our target masses. In some cases, the mean metallicity of the halo is high enough to affect our luminosity results, especially for helium emission lines, but it is also possible that the regions where the stars reside contain only pristine gas [\citep=Whalen2008] [\citep=Xu2016]. If the metal enrichment by previous stars affects the star forming region, this could also supress the formation of successive metal-free objects, thus reducing the SFR, or even allowing only for an initial burst [\citep=Nomoto2006] [\citep=Heger2002].

It is important to mention that the maximum photon flux and luminosities that we have found correspond to the upper tails of the stochastic distributions. When these distributions are broad, specially for m9M500a2, the expected number of stochastic stellar populations giving rise to these values is small and the values in the peaks of the stochastic distributions are far from those in the tails. For this IMF, and considering populations with ages > 10 Myr in Figure [\ref=fig:csfr1000_Myr_L], we find that [formula] ([formula]) of the galaxies have luminosities above [formula] ([formula]) erg  s -  1, and [formula] ([formula]) have values above L1640  =  1039 ([formula]) erg  s -  1. The probability for obtaining these extreme values increases and the peaks of the distributions are closer to the tails (the distributions narrow) when considering flatter IMFs. The simple deterministic calculation for m9M500a0 considering Lyα case-B departures and a total stellar mass 1000 M[formula] (Equation [\ref=eq:lyab]) gives luminosities [formula] and L1640  ~  1039  erg  s -  1, which are similar to those for m9M500a2. The differences between tail and peak values are less important for the other populations with lower upper mass limits.

Many works have investigated the possible detection of Population III galaxies and the use of different techniques to distinguish them from the more 'normal' galaxies [\citep=Schaerer2014]. This is a difficult task since different factors which are still not fully constrained (e.g., dust, galactic feedback, neutral gas fraction, gravitational lensing, etc.) can contribute to the enhancement or reduction of the intrinsic fluxes during the transmission through the ISM and IGM [\citep=Johnson2009] [\citep=Dijkstra2011] [\citep=Laursen2011] [\citep=Smith2015]. The resonant nature of the Lyα transition adds an extra difficulty in this case, strongly affecting the highly uncertain escape fraction of Lyα photons [\citep=Dijkstra2014]. We consider the simple case of our default target mass, 1000 M[formula], with intrinsic luminosity values [formula] and L1640  ~  1039  erg  s -  1. We calculate the fluxes expected from populations at redshift z = 7,  10 and 14, accounting for the dilution factor due to the luminosity distance, and we compare them with the sensitivity limit of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) aboard the JWST [\citep=Gardner2006]. We consider the case of line fluxes from a point source, with a signal-to-noise, SNR = 10, and 104 s of integration time. We find that Lyα luminosity is a factor of [formula] below the detection threshold at redshifts z = 7 and 10, and falls below a factor of 40 at z = 14. The helium luminosity is a factor [formula] below the detection limit at z = 7 and almost three orders of magnitude below for the highest redshifts. Therefore, higher total stellar masses and/or gravitational lensing [\citep=Stark2007] [\citep=Zackrisson2012] [\citep=Zackrisson2015] appear to be indispensable for a spectroscopic confirmation of Pop III galaxies (non-metal detection and the presence of strong Lyα emission), and also for detection with, e.g., the combination of wide-field surveys and multiband photometry [\citep=Zackrisson2011b] [\citep=Zackrisson2011a] [\citep=Inoue2011].

Summary and conclusions

We have revisited the spectra of population III galaxies, specifically focusing on the nebular hydrogen Lyα and [formula] lines. We have computed a series of stellar helium and hydrogen model atmospheres covering a mass range from [formula]. We have used the stars to construct several populations, allowing for top-heavy and Salpeter slope IMFs, and different upper stellar mass limits. We have included upper mass limits that are lower than those in earlier works, motivated by recent studies favoring the formation of low mass objects, and, for the first time in studies of Pop III populations, we have considered the stochastic sampling of the IMF. We have obtained the nebular spectra using our own SEDs and the photoionization code Cloudy. Finally, we have explored the departures from the case-B recombination assumption for our populations, and we have revisited their origin. Our results can be summarized as follows.

The Lyα line flux is enhanced by a factor of 2  -  3 compared to case-B, depending on the IMF and parameters of the nebula, in agreement with [\cite=Raiter2010]. Our analysis shows that the origin of the Lyα departures from case-B is due mainly to energetic free electrons which collisionally excite and ionize hydrogen atoms. The photoionization from the first excited state, argued to be the major mechanism in previous works, is negligible.

Stochastic sampling of the IMF produces large fluctuations in the ionizing photon flux, specially for the single-ionized helium (Q(HeII); more than a factor 100 for a total stellar mass of 1 000 M[formula]), due to the strong dependence on the mass of the stars within the populations. For the case of hydrogen and the LW band, the distributions around the deterministic value are much narrower. The stochastic effects are more important for IMFs with high upper mass limits and also for those which disfavor the presence of massive stars, i.e., those with Salpeter slopes instead of flat IMFs. Stochasticity can enhance the Lyα flux up to a factor ~  3 in populations with massive stars (upper mass limit IMF of 500 M[formula]). This, added to the case-B departure implies a boost by a factor of ~  8 compared to the common calculations. For populations with less massive stars the total boost reaches values ~  5, depending on the IMFs and nebular parameters. For the case of the [formula] line, stochasticity boosts the flux up to a factor ~  3. Accounting for a lower total stellar mass, 100 M[formula], the stochastic effects increase significantly showing the strong anti-correlation between these two parameters. In this case, the fluctuations found for the hydrogen (LW) ionizing photon fluxes can have implications to the ionizing (dissociating) power inferred for Pop III stars. On the other hand, for a total stellar mass of 10 000 M[formula], the stochastic effects are strongly reduced.

When considering the effect of time evolution for a single starburst we see that the distributions slightly broaden with time, specially for the case of flat IMFs. The stochastic effects are again more important for high stellar mass upper limit IMFs and for low values of the total stellar mass. Considering periodic bursts of star formation, we observe similar stochastic behaviours as before, and all the distributions flatten after [formula] Myr. The distributions reach maximum intrinsic luminosity values of [formula] and L1640  ~  1039  erg  s -  1 for a total stellar mass of 1 000 M[formula]. For the case of Lyα, these values are a factor [formula] below the sensitivity limits of the JWST at redshifts z = 7 - 10, but this can improve considering the possible effects of gravitational lensing and/or higher total stellar mass. [\cite=Visbal2016] have recently presented an analysis which allows for the formation of late ([formula]), massive (> 106 M[formula]) Pop III starbursts in ~  109 M[formula] dark matter halos, due to photoionization feedback effects by nearby galaxies. In addition, these stellar populations would likely reside in large ionized bubbles, thus illustrating that the neutral IGM may occasionally have a minor impact on the Lyα flux from Pop III galaxies [\cite=Stark2016]. Stellar populations of such characteristics would be above the detection limits, even for the case of helium fluxes.

We conclude by stressing that the joint effect of the stochastic sampling of the IMF and case-B departures analysed in this work can give rise to values of the Lyα and HeII[formula] line fluxes which deviate significantly from the standard analytical calculations which ignore these effects. Our study, as well as previous works, shows that gravitational lensing is required to detect Pop III galaxies with JWST. However, the enhancement obtained in our results reduces significantly the required magnification.
