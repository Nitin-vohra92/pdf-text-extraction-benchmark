Rational approximations of the exponential function at rational points

Introduction

We will present both explicit and asymptotic irrationality measure results i.e. lower bounds for the quantity |es / t - M / N| as a function of positive integer N, where s / t is an arbitrary non-zero rational number.

As usual, the lower bounds are achieved by constructing sequences of high quality rational approximations to es / t. Our approximations are based on the convergents of the generalized continued fraction expansion

[formula]

which are in fact the diagonal Padé approximants of the exponential function [\cite=perron],[\cite=joth], [\cite=khov]. Special attention will be paid for divisibility properties of the numerators and the denominators of the convergents of

[formula]

evaluated at z  =  s / t. There appears an unexpected and fairly big common factor which is related to the prime number decomposition of s. Thereby when |s|  ≥  3, we improve the existing results considerably; the comparison will be done in the next section.

Let [formula], [formula] and gcd (s,t) = 1. Denote the inverse of the function y(z)  =  z log z, z  ≥  1 / e, as z(y). We define z0(y)  =  y and zn(y)  =  y /  log zn - 1(y), [formula]. In the following we denote

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula] and gcd (s,t) = 1. Then

[formula]

for all [formula] with

[formula]

If we wish to use elementary functions only, we can approximate the function z(y) by the function z1(y) to get a more familiar looking bound.

Let [formula] and gcd(s,t) = 1. Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for all [formula] with

[formula]

We note that there is nothing special about the constant ρ that appears as a multiplier of the function ε(N) above. The seemingly arbitrary choice is made just to keep N2 explicit and relatively simple. For large enough N any constant strictly larger than one suffices, as in fact

[formula]

We will formalize this observation as a corollary of an asymptotic nature. For more precision, we also investigate approximating z(y) by zn(y), [formula].

Let [formula] and gcd(s,t) = 1. For any ε3  >  0 there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for all [formula]. For any [formula] there exists c3  >  0 and [formula] such that

[formula]

for all [formula].

If |s| = 3, then we get quite dramatic improvement to the earlier results. As an example we consider number e3. A straightforward application of Corollary [\ref=SPECIALTHEOREM] would give us

[formula]

for all [formula] with log N  ≥  e4e  ≈  52740. However by following the proof of Corollary [\ref=SPECIALTHEOREM] and using sharper bounds we obtain a better result:

Let s = 3 and t = 1. Then

[formula]

for all [formula] with log N  ≥  983.

If we compare the result [\eqref=Onthebest] to the earlier results we see that on the best the earlier investigations give a term 2 log 3 instead of log 3 in the exponent of [\eqref=Onthebest] (see the next chapter for a general analysis).

Comparison to existing results

The simple continued fraction expansions of e±  1 / t and e±  2 / t are well known, see e.g. [\cite=mccabe]. They are ideal for constructing lower bounds for |e±  1 / t - M / N| and |e±  2 / t - M / N|, which is done by Davis [\cite=davis], [\cite=davis1979], Doduliková et al. [\cite=hanclalmostperiodic] and Tasoev [\cite=tasoev] for example. In fact, all the convergents of [\eqref=GENCONTFRACEXP] evaluated at z  =  1 / t and z  =  2 / t are also convergents of the simple continued fraction expansions of e1 / t and e2 / t, respectively [\cite=mccabe] (they cover asymptotically 1 / 3 and 3 / 5 of all the simple continued fraction convergents, respectively). However, our approach is intended for the general case, using the triangle inequality instead of approximation properties of the simple continued fractions, and thus we cannot match existing results when |s|  ≤  2.

When |s|  ≥  3, the simple continued fraction expansions of es / t are unavailable. We then have 1  <  α  <  |s|, which means that the common factor we found in the numerators and the denominators of our approximations is enough to give us an advantage over existing results. Note also, that before extracting common factors we have α = 1, β = 0, γ = 1 in our Theorem [\ref=GENERALTHEOREM]. This will be a starting platform for presenting already existing results.

Bundschuh [\cite=bundschuh1979] used Padé approximation technique to prove that

[formula]

for all [formula], where cB > 0 and δ > 0 were explicitly given. Bundschuh's result applies to any N  ≥  1, while Corollary [\ref=SPECIALTHEOREM] for instance requires N to be rather big. On the other hand, Corollary [\ref=SPECIALTHEOREM] has better asymptotic behaviour because of having the constant 2 log (|s| / α) instead of 4 log |s| in the exponent.

Shiokawa [\cite=shiokawa] used the representation [\eqref=GENCONTFRACEXP] to show that there exists a constant cS  >  0 such that

[formula]

where τ  =  4t / (es2), for [formula] (we modified the statement of Shiokawa to use our notation z(y) and to apply also for negative s). Note also that before extracting common factors (meaning α = 1, β = 0, γ = 1) our Theorem [\ref=GENERALTHEOREM] gives Shiokawa's result [\eqref=SHIOKAWA1] with a completely explicit constant in place of cS. Further, if |s| > 1, then α > 1 and τ  <  σ, giving an improvement to [\eqref=SHIOKAWA1] despite β being positive.

Using Padé approximants just below the diagonal, Zheng [\cite=zheng] proved that for any εZ  >  0 there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for [formula]. As the relation between εZ and NZ is not explicitly given, the statement [\eqref=ZHENG] is in fact equivalent after omitting the factors 8te2|s| / t / s2 and log N  /   log  log N. Again, when α  >  1 and because of the sharper treatment of ε3, our Corollary [\ref=ASYMPTOTICTHEOREM] is asymptotically better than [\eqref=ZHENG] already with n = 1.

Other effective results on the rational approximation problem include e.g. Mahler [\cite=mahler] and Nesterenko et al. [\cite=neswal], neither of which has general bounds with the same precision as we do.

Some facts about generalized continued fractions

By a generalized continued fraction we mean the expression

[formula]

for which we use standard notation

[formula]

The convergents of [\eqref=GC] are defined by

[formula]

where the numerators An and denominators Bn both satisfy the recurrence formula

[formula]

for [formula] with initial values A0 = b0, B0 = 1, A1 = b0b1 + a1 and B1 = b1. By the value of [\eqref=GC] we mean the limit

[formula]

when it exists. Using recurrence formula [\eqref=ABRECURRENCES] and induction gives

[formula]

for all [formula], which by telescoping implies

[formula]

Supposing the convergence the limit

[formula]

exists, which further implies

[formula]

This we may use for example in the following way. If ak and bk are positive for [formula], then we can use the standard error estimate of an alternating sum:

[formula]

Proofs

The exponential function ez is expressible as a generalized continued fraction

[formula]

for all [formula]. When [formula], [formula] and [formula], we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

The recurrence formula [\eqref=ABRECURRENCES] for numerators An and denominators Bn of the convergents of E(s,t) looks like

[formula]

for [formula] with initial values A0 = 0, B0 = 1, A1 = s2 and B1 = 6t. Our proof for the main theorem also uses two auxiliary sequences (C±n)n  ≥  0 defined by

[formula]

Clearly the numbers C±n, n  ≥  2 satisfy the recurrence formula [\eqref=Cnrecurrence] too with initial values C±0  =  2t  ±  s and [formula].

For a prime number p and a natural number n define the p-adic order of n in the usual way:

[formula]

The function vp has the properties

[formula]

and

[formula]

the non-Archimedean triangle inequality. We will need Legendre's theorem on p-adic orders of factorials:

Let [formula], where [formula] for [formula] and am  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Before the proof of our main result let us give two Lemmas on the greatest common divisor of C+n and C-n.

[formula]

where

[formula]

We show by induction that

[formula]

First of all, with n = 0 and n = 1 we end up with the required initial values C±0  =  2t  ±  s and C±1  =  12t2  ±  6ts + s2. For n  ≥  2 we use the recurrence formula [\eqref=Cnrecurrence]:

[formula]

Let p be an odd prime dividing s, and thus not dividing t. Using the non-Archimedean triangle inequality [\eqref=nonarch] gives

[formula]

where in the penultimate step we used Legendre's theorem [\ref=legendre] to estimate

[formula]

If v2(s)  ≥  1, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

If we assume that v2(C±k)  ≥  k + 1 for all k < n, then

[formula]

Hence by induction v2(C±n)  ≥  n + 1 for all n  ≥  0.

[formula]

If v2(s)  ≥  1 then 2 contributes to Dn by 2n + 1 as shown in Lemma [\ref=ISOTEKIJA].

Let p be an odd prime dividing s. Let [formula], [formula] for [formula] and am  ≥  1. Estimating

[formula]

and 1  ≤  sp(n + 1)  ≤  (m + 1)(p - 1) in Legendre's theorem [\ref=legendre] yields

[formula]

The claim follows.

From the convergents of E(s,t) we get a sequence of linear forms

[formula]

First we note that the remainder Rn may be estimated by property [\eqref=REMAINDER], namely

[formula]

By [\eqref=EXPKETJU] we have

[formula]

which substituted into [\eqref=SIMULTA1] implies

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=ISOTEKIJA] tells that

[formula]

By denoting

[formula]

we get new linear forms

[formula]

Fix now [formula] and [formula]. Our target is to give a lower bound for the linear form

[formula]

Denote also

[formula]

If Ωn  ≠  0, then by triangle inequality we get

[formula]

Since Ln  →  0 and 1  ≤  2N|L0| by [\eqref=RAJAN], there exists the biggest [formula] such that

[formula]

By definition

[formula]

for all k  ≥  n̂ + 1. Since

[formula]

for all [formula], we see that Ωn̂ + 1  ≠  0 or Ωn̂ + 2  ≠  0. Hence we get from [\eqref=KIIKKU] and [\eqref=fixhatn2] the estimate

[formula]

where j = 1 or j = 2. Now we need to find an upper bound for |Hn̂ + j| depending on N. By noting that

[formula]

we are led to the estimate

[formula]

Next we turn to estimation of the terms Bn̂ + 1 and |Rn̂ + j|. By [\eqref=fixhatn] and [\eqref=REMAINDER] we get

[formula]

and so we have

[formula]

Further, by [\eqref=fixhatn2] we have

[formula]

Thus, combining [\eqref=LEDESTIMATE] with [\eqref=BHATTU2] and [\eqref=RHATTU2] yields to

[formula]

On the other hand, by the recurrence relation [\eqref=ABRECURRENCES], Stirling's formula

[formula]

(see e.g. [\cite=stirling]) and the fact that [formula] we deduce the lower bound

[formula]

The bounds [\eqref=BHATTU2] and [\eqref=BHATTU3] together imply

[formula]

In order to get rid of the non-significant terms we assume n̂  >  β - 1 and make technical estimates log (n̂  +  3 / 2)  >   log (n̂  +  1  -  β) and log (n̂  +  3 / 2)  >   log (n̂  +  1) in a specific proportion and continue

[formula]

Suppose now that

[formula]

Then the second term in [\eqref=twoterms] is non-negative and with the notation

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Suppose further that

[formula]

thereby we can use the inverse function z(y) of the function y(z) = z log z and get

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Our assumptions n̂  >  β - 1, [\eqref=hatnlus1p] and [\eqref=invehto] are valid when

[formula]

If n̂ + 1 < η then by the assumption [\eqref=RAJAN] the upper bound [\eqref=HATUNYLARAJA] holds anyway. Hence by the estimate [\eqref=LEDESTIMATE2] we get

[formula]

The result then follows from [\eqref=pihvi].

Before proving the corollaries we present some properties of the inverse function z(y) of the function y(z) = z log z, z  ≥  1 / e.

The inverse function z(y) of the function y(z) = z log z, z  ≥  1 / e, is strictly increasing. Define z0(y) = y and zn(y) = y /  log zn - 1(y) for [formula]. If y > e, then

[formula]

and the inverse function may be given by the infinite nested logarithm fraction

[formula]

For the error made when approximating z(y) by zn(y) we have

[formula]

Everything but the errors [\eqref=zerror] is proven in [\cite=hancl1]. The case n = 0 is immediate, and the case n = 1 is true as

[formula]

When n  ≥  2 is odd, we can bound

[formula]

When n  ≥  2 is even, we only get

[formula]

The claim follows.

Suppose [formula] and [formula].

If σ  ≥  1, then

[formula]

Since log N  ≥  e4e, which also implies

[formula]

we now have

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=inverse] and the fact that log x / x is strictly decreasing when x > e we get

[formula]

Hence by Lemma [\ref=inverse] we have

[formula]

Then suppose that σ  <  1. The assumption log N  ≥  σ- 2 is equivalent with inequality log (σ log N)  ≥   log  log N / 2. Using [\eqref=apuepis] we can estimate

[formula]

which is also implied by [\eqref=logz1pos] when σ  ≥  1. As before we get

[formula]

The assumption log N  ≥  e4e implies log  log  log N  ≥  2 and the assumption log N  ≥  σ- 2 implies -   log σ  /   log  log N  ≤  1 / 2. By Lemma [\ref=inverse] and inequality [\eqref=epsilon]

[formula]

Altogether [\eqref=ztoz1pos] and [\eqref=ztoz1neg] can be summarized as

[formula]

Because η  -  β  ≥  e / σ, we have

[formula]

Thus Lemma [\ref=inverse] and inequality [\eqref=logz1] yield

[formula]

Now

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=apuepis] implies

[formula]

Since log N  ≥  β2 and log  log  log N > 1, [\eqref=valivaihe] gives β log  log N  <   log Nε(N). By [\eqref=ztoz1] we have

[formula]

Finally since

[formula]

and since [\eqref=apuepis] implies ( log N)3 / 4  <   log N /  log  log N, we can estimate

[formula]

and get

[formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=GENERALTHEOREM] and inequalities [\eqref=ztoz1], [\eqref=Z], [\eqref=zeta] and then [\eqref=epsiloncontrol] gives

[formula]

which concludes the proof.

Let's show by induction that

[formula]

With n = 0 there is nothing to prove. For n  ≥  1 we use Lemma [\ref=inverse] to estimate

[formula]

and to calculate

[formula]

In other words, if n is even then there exist a constant c3  >  0 and an integer [formula] such that

[formula]

for all N  ≥  N3.

With odd n we also need to consider the errors made in the approximation of z(y) by zn(y). For starters,

[formula]

Because

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=inverse]. So if n is odd then for any constant ε3  >  0 there exists a constant c3  >  0 and an integer [formula] such that

[formula]

when N  ≥  N3. Which of the two error terms is dominant depends on whether n  =  1 or n  ≥  3.

To conclude the proof we use inequalities [\eqref=even] and [\eqref=odd] to Theorem [\ref=GENERALTHEOREM], noting that because

[formula]

then

[formula]

and hence the function Z(N) is not significant.

Now we have the values [formula], β = 1, γ = 3, [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] with log N  ≥  983. Because log N  ≥  983 > σ- 5, we can estimate

[formula]

Since log  log N  ≥   log 983 > 2e, we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Now log  log  log N  ≥   log  log 983 and -   log σ  /   log  log N  ≤  1 / 5 so by Lemma [\ref=inverse] and inequality [\eqref=epsilon2]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=apuepis2] implies

[formula]

Since log N  ≥  983 then [\eqref=valivaihe2] gives 30 log  log N  <   log Nε(N). Then by [\eqref=ztoz12] we have

[formula]

Finally since [\eqref=apuepis2] implies ( log N)7 / 10  <   log N /  log  log N we can estimate

[formula]

and get

[formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=GENERALTHEOREM] and inequalities [\eqref=ztoz12], [\eqref=booboo], [\eqref=zeta2] and then [\eqref=epsiloncontrol2] gives

[formula]

which is what had to be proved.
