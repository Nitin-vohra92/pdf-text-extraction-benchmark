Introduction

[\citet=M16] recently discovered that AR Sco is a M dwarf/white dwarf binary with an orbital period of 3.56 h and a white dwarf spin period of 1.95 m. The white dwarf's spin is slowing with a characteristic time [formula] y. Most of the radiated power is emitted from the M dwarf near the L1 inner Lagrange point. Remarkably, the phase of maximum is displaced from conjunction by about 0.15 of the orbit.

AR Sco emits X-rays but they are only a small fraction of the system's luminosity, implying that it is not powered by accretion. Spindown is the remaining plausible source of energy, with a power [formula], where I is the white dwarf's moment of inertia and ω its rotation rate. The spindown power is converted to radiation with efficiency ~  9%, several times the fraction of 4π sterad subtended at the white dwarf by its companion. This excludes reprocessing of roughly isotropic radiation from the white dwarf as the source of the observed radiation. [\citet=M16] suggest the white dwarf's rotational energy is dissipated by interaction of its magnetic field with the M dwarf's atmosphere. The spectral energy distribution indicates a substantial contribution of synchrotron radiation, indicating nonthermal processes such as magnetic reconnection that accelerate energetic particles.

The rapid spindown suggests that AR Sco may be a missing link between synchronously rotating polars (AM Her stars) whose synchronism is maintained by magnetostatic interaction [\citep=JKR79] to extreme accuracy [\citep=K89] and the asynchronous intermediate polars (IP). Because AR Sco is still far from synchronism the rate of dissipation of its white dwarf's rotational energy is much greater than that in almost-synchronous systems like V1500 Cyg [\citep=K91a] [\citep=K91b].

In at least one other IP, AE Aqr [\citep=IB08] [\citep=M09], synchronization is also the chief source of energy and radio emission indicates particle acceleration. The photometry of AE Aqr is complicated by its flaring, but the amplitude of the periodic modulation is low and is explicable as an ellipsoidal variation without evidence of a reflection effect or other interaction with the white dwarf [\citep=vP89] [\citep=B91]. The secondary star of AE Aqr is of earlier spectral type (K4V) than that of AR Sco (M5V) and likely intrinsically more luminous, reducing the effect of magnetic heating on the light curve. AR Sco and AE Aqr may be members of a class of synchronars, magnetic binaries whose emission is powered by the synchronization of their compact (white dwarf) asynchronously rotating components. AR Sco is an extreme example in which the contribution of intrinsic stellar and accretional luminosity is particularly small.

The visible brightness of AR Sco does not peak at conjunction (orbital phase φ  =  0.5), when we might expect to see the heated side of the M dwarf most fully. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the origin of this surprising observation. I consider two hypotheses:

The power dissipated by interaction between the white dwarf's magnetic field and the M dwarf is greater on the latter's "upstream" face where a bow wave may form (Fig. [\ref=ARScoF1]) than on its "downstream" face. The dissipation rate does not depend on orbital phase but we view the hottest portion of the M star more fully before conjunction.

The white dwarf's spin axis is not aligned with the orbital axis and its magnetic moment is not aligned with its spin axis. The dissipation rate in the M dwarf's atmosphere depends on the orbital phase (Fig. [\ref=ARScoF2]). Precession of the spin axis makes the orbital phase of maximum drift.

In either hypothesis the optical maximum is displaced from conjunction. In the first hypothesis it precedes conjunction if the white dwarf spin is prograde (and follows it if retrograde). In the second hypothesis any phase is possible, but precession makes it recede (if the spin is prograde).

In contrast to the white dwarf pulsar model of [\cite=GZH16], I do not assume a wind from either star. Neither white dwarfs nor M dwarfs are known to emit winds, and their low intrinsic luminosities argue against the existence of such winds with significant density. Rather, I attribute the dissipation to the interaction of the white dwarf's vacuum magnetic field with the M dwarf's atmosphere. This interaction occurs, and the dissipation rate varies with orbital phase, shifting maximum light from conjunction, even if the white dwarf's rotation and magnetic axes are aligned, although that alignment is excluded in AR Sco because of the large amplitude modulation at the sideband of the spin period.

Magnetic fields

The hypothesis that the white dwarf is spinning down as a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum may be rejected because it requires excessive magnetic fields. Equating the spin-down power [formula] to the radiated power 2μ2 sin 2θω4 / (3c3), where θ is the angle between the spin and rotational axes, [formula] is the white dwarf's moment of inertia and its spindown rate [formula] s- 2, gives the magnetic moment

[formula]

The polar magnetic field

[formula]

Numerical evaluation (Table [\ref=Bpolar]) yields fields outside the range of observed white dwarf fields and therefore implausible.

[\citet=M16] pointed out the difficulty of coupling an estimated 9% of the spin-down power to a M dwarf that occupies only 2-3% of the white dwarf's sky. This excludes a mechanism that radiates the energy in a broad beam, such as that of a rotating dipole, and indicates non-radiative coupling that can be (as in a well-designed transformer) nearly 100% efficient.

One such mechanism is magnetic dissipation in the M dwarf's atmosphere. Because the field is only approximately quasi-static its magnitude on the M dwarf's leading (with respect to the rotating magnetic field) face may be substantially greater than that on its trailing face. The resulting torque [formula] can be of order

[formula]

where RM  ≈  2.5  ×  1010 cm is the radius of an M5 dwarf, a = 6.0  ×  1010(1  +  MM / MWD) csc i cm is the separation of the stars [\citep=M16] and BM is the magnetic field on the leading face of the M dwarf. Then

[formula]

The magnetic field at the surface of the white dwarf

[formula]

A number of these parameters, especially I, are uncertain (over the allowed range [formula] [\citep=M16] I varies by an order of magnitude; Table [\ref=WDdata]), but these fields are plausible. They point to an unusually, but not extraordinarily, magnetized white dwarf in AR Sco, which is consistent with its rapid spindown and fast dissipation.

Inclination

The inclination angle i is not directly measured, but can be constrained from the mass function and the upper bound on white dwarf masses. The mass function [\citep=M16]

[formula]

where MM is the mass of the M dwarf. Substituting [formula] and expanding in a Taylor series yields

[formula]

where it is assumed [formula] is small. Following [\citet=M16], we take [formula].

The Orbital Phase of Maximum

There are two distinct explanations of the fact that the optical maximum of AR Sco does not occur at conjunction, in contrast to expectation for a classic reflection effect.

Magnetic Bow Wave

If the white dwarf were rotating slowly enough then a magnetostatic treatment of its interaction with the M dwarf [\citep=JKR79] would be valid. There would still be dissipation [\citep=K89] [\citep=K91a] [\citep=K91b], likely enhanced by turbulent (rather than just Ohmic) resistivity, but if the M dwarf were symmetric about the line of centers (an assumption that breaks down if it overflows its Roche lobe and there is a mass transfer stream) there would be symmetry between the leading and trailing faces of the M dwarf and maximum light would occur at conjunction.

In AR Sco the parameter ωa / c  ≈  0.15 /  sin i is large enough to distinguish the magnetic interaction between leading and trailing faces of the M dwarf (Fig. [\ref=ARScoF2]) and to describe them as bow wave and wake. Unlike the Solar wind, there is no material wind from the white dwarf, only a vacuum electromagnetic field that cannot be completely described by the magnetostatic near zone regime, although it is well inside (by a factor of 5-7) the speed of light cylinder and the radiation zone.

Precession

If the white dwarf's spin axis is not parallel to the orbital axis the magnetic field at the M dwarf, and therefore the rate of dissipation, will vary with orbital phase. This provides a possible explanation for the fact that the optical maximum does not occur at orbital phase 0.5, as it would for a classical reflection effect. A simplified possible geometry is shown in Fig. [\ref=ARScoF2], in which the magnetic axis is assumed to be perpendicular to the rotation axis. The maximum magnetic field, along the magnetic poles of the white dwarf, then sweeps out the rotational equatorial plane of the white dwarf.

The M dwarf crosses this plane twice per orbit. If the dissipation rate varies with the magnetic field this would introduce a dependence on orbital phase. The observed intensity would then be the result of a convolution of this orbital phase dependence of the dissipation rate with the orbital phase dependence of the visibility of the heated face of the M dwarf. An analogous result follows for any dependence of dissipation on the field (for example, the dissipation might vary [formula] or [formula], where Maxwell's equations imply [formula].).

If the white dwarf's spin axis makes an angle ε with the orbital axis, the spin axis will precess, causing the optical maximum to drift in orbital phase. This might explain the scatter [\citet=M16] of brightness of AR Sco at orbital phases 0.25-0.4, if the spin axis precessed during the period of photometric observations. The precession rate is

[formula]

where I3 and I1 are moments of inertia about, respectively, the white dwarf's polar and equatorial axes. Using the orbital geometry,

where K2 is the M dwarf's line-of-sight velocity amplitude, P the orbital period and fp an oblateness coefficient obtained from the calculations of [\citet=J64]. The dynamic oblateness is.

[formula]

where BChand  =  1.96  ×  106 g/cm3 (for μe  =  2) and [formula] The relevant properties of white dwarfs are summarized in Table [\ref=WDdata].

We consider two limiting cases: If sin i has the minimum value permitted by Eq. [\ref=inclination] then

[formula]

In the other limit sin i  =  1 and

[formula]

Numerical results for AR Sco are shown in Table [\ref=results]. The condition sin i  ≤  1 sets a lower bound of about 0.81 [formula] on MWD [\citep=M16], so that the properties of lower mass white dwarfs shown in Table [\ref=WDdata] are not relevant to AR Sco.

Discussion

The remarkable properties of AR Sco support the suggestion of [\citet=M16] that it differs from most intermediate polars in that it is powered by synchronization of the white dwarf spin with the orbital motion (a "synchronar") rather than by accretion. The displacement of the optical maximum from conjunction implies that energy is deposited asymmetrically on the surface of the M dwarf. This may be explained either as a consequence of the subrelativistic speed of the rotating white dwarf magnetosphere at the M dwarf or of a white dwarf spin axis that is oblique to the orbital axis. In the former hypothesis the orbital phase of maximum is likely to be fixed; in the latter hypothesis the spin axis precesses with a period of decades, producing a drift in the orbital phase of maximum.

AR Sco differs from most intermediate polars because accretion contributes only a small fraction, perhaps none, of its luminosity. This is likely attributable to a more magnetized white dwarf in AR Sco. AR Sco also differs from non-accreting binary (neutron star) pulsars with nondegenerate companions because the binary pulsars' companions are in the radiation zone of the pulsars' dipole fields, so any interaction between the companion and the dipole field does not couple back to the pulsar's rotation; energy may be deposited in the companion, but the pulsar despins as an isolated object.
