Importance of intrinsic and non-network contribution in PageRank centrality and its effect on PageRank localization

Introduction

Complex network tools have been used in different fields from social, technological and biological networks  [\cite=Albert02] [\cite=Newmanbook], to analyze the structure and dynamics of the network. Different centrality measures have been used to find the important vertices in a network e.g., degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, vertex betweenness centrality, edge betweenness centrality, closeness centrality[\cite=Newmanbook], etc. Among them, the simplest measure is the degree centrality. Degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.

PageRank is another important measure and is used in network tasks like, information retrieval, link prediction and community detection[\cite=Gleich15] [\cite=chung09]. In 1998, Brin and Page [\cite=BP98] developed the PageRank algorithm to rank websites in their search engine. PageRank score, xi, of a vertex i in an undirected and unweighted network, is defined as [formula], where 0  <  α < 1 is the damping factor, also known as teleportation factor, A is the adjacency matrix corresponding to the network, kj is the degree of the vertex j and βi is the intrinsic, non-network contribution. Many researchers have studied the significance of α in PageRank [\cite=Langville04] [\cite=Langville06] [\cite=Pretto02] [\cite=Fortunato07] [\cite=Ding09]. However, till now, no study has been taken place for the same for βi. In many cases the value of βi has been taken as 1 [\cite=Langville04] [\cite=Pretto02] [\cite=Fortunato07].

Localization of eigenvector is a common phenomenon in most of the networks and it is frequently suggested that the main cause of localization is due to the presence of high degree vertices [\cite=Goltsev12] [\cite=Martin14]. Localization means that most of the weight of the centrality accumulates in a few number of vertices. Recently, empirical studies in PageRank suggest that PageRank does not show localization [\cite=Ermann13].

In this paper, we show that depending upon intrinsic and non-network contribution, PageRank value changes. This article has been organized in the following way: in Chapter [\ref=Aproof], we show that if the intrinsic and non-network contribution of the vertices are the same or proportional to their degrees, then the PageRanks remain same or proportional to the degree of the vertices. We also show that if the intrinsic and non-network contribution of the vertices is zero then PageRank values become proportional to the degrees. In Chapter [\ref=numerical], our study on simulated and empirical networks support our findings. On the contrary to the common belief we show that, for some networks, PageRank centrality can be localized and the value of βi can effect in the localization of the PageRank centrality. Chapter [\ref=conclusion] concludes with some discussion.

PageRank centrality: Intrinsic and non-network contribution proportional to degree

Consider a simple undirected connected network G of size n, with adjacency matrix A. The PageRank centrality xi of a vertex i in the network G is defined as:

[formula]

where 0  <  α  <  1 is the damping factor (Google search engine uses α  =  0.85 [\cite=Langville06]), kj denotes the degree of vertex j, and βi is the intrinsic and non-network contribution to the vertex i.

In matrix form, the Equation ([\ref=equ1]) can be written as:

[formula]

where [formula] is the diagonal matrix with elements Dii  =  ki and [formula]. Equation ([\ref=equ2]) can be written as:

[formula]

Since [formula] Equation ([\ref=equ3]) can be written as the sum of an infinite series:

[formula]

Now [formula], is a column stochastic matrix. Since G is undirected and connected [formula] is diagonalizable. One can write [formula] as a linear combination of the eigenvectors [formula] of [formula], as

[formula]

Then the Equation ([\ref=equ5]) becomes

[formula]

Let [formula] be the eigenvalues of [formula] corresponding to the eigenvectors [formula], respectively. Then

[formula]

After some simple calculation, we get

[formula]

Since, [formula], we get

[formula]

Therefore, the PageRank vector [formula] of a network is the linear sum of eigenvectors of [formula].

If the value of [formula] is proportional to degrees, then Equation ([\ref=equ6]) becomes:

[formula]

where [formula] is the leading eigenvector of [formula]. Note that [formula] is proportional to the degree of the network. Therefore, Equation ([\ref=equ10]) reduces to

[formula]

Hence, PageRank centrality is proportional to the degree of the network.

PageRank can also be quantified successively with an initial estimation of [formula] from Equation ([\ref=equ1]) or (equivalently Equation ([\ref=equ2])). Equation ([\ref=equ2]) will be,

[formula]

where [formula] is any initial value of [formula] usually taken [formula] [\cite=Newmanbook]. If the intrinsic and non-network contribution is zero, then from Equation ([\ref=remark2]), we get

[formula]

In this case, we take [formula] any non-zero vector as [formula] will not contribute anything. After t iterative steps we have

[formula]

Now, writing [formula] as a linear combination of the eigenvectors [formula] of [formula], we get

[formula]

for some appropriate choice of ci'. Then

[formula]

Since |μi| < 1 for all [formula], we get [formula] in the limit t  →    ∞  . As c'1 and α are constants and [formula] is proportional to degree, it follows that PageRank centrality is proportional to the degree centrality.

Results

We explore four different values of intrinsic and non-network contribution, β.

βi is inversely proportional to the degree of vertex i.

All βi are equal to one.

βi is proportional to the degree of vertex i.

βi is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex i.

In all the above cases, we have taken α  =  0.85.

Our numerical simulation on Erdös-Rényi random network [\cite=Bollobas01], we have observed that if the value of βi is proportional to the inverse of the degree of vertex i then PageRank score increases for a few number of low degree vertices and for other, PageRank is stable (see Figure [\ref=Fig1](a)). Here 'stable' means, whether the PageRank scores are positively correlated with the degree. If β is equal or proportional to the degrees of the vertices then PageRank centrality is proportional to the degree of the vertices (see Figure [\ref=Fig1](c)). PageRank values are stable when β is either equal to one or proportional to the square of the degree of vertex (see Figure [\ref=Fig1](b) and Figure [\ref=Fig1](d)). In comparison with random network, small-world and scale-free network are stable with any value of β that we have considered (see Figure [\ref=Fig2] and Figure [\ref=Fig3]).

However, in real-world networks, the results are not consistent for the above mentioned cases. In Blog network, we have observed that PageRank score fluctuates when β is inversely proportional to the degree of vertex (see Figure [\ref=FigBlog](a)). When all βi are equal to one, PageRank value fluctuates but less than that in the previous case (see Figure [\ref=FigBlog](b)). When βi is proportional to the degree of vertex i, β and PageRank score correlate positively (see Figure [\ref=FigBlog](c)). PageRank values are stable when βi is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex i (see Figure [\ref=FigBlog](d)).

In P2P (peer-to-peer) network, we have seen high fluctuation of PageRank value for some high degree vertices when β is inversely proportional to the degree of a vertex (see Figure [\ref=FigP2P](a)). Similar observation is also found when all βi are equal to one (see Figure [\ref=FigP2P](b)). When βi is proportional to the degree of vertex i, PageRank score is also proportional to the degree of vertex i (see Figure [\ref=FigP2P](c)). PageRank score is stable when βi is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex i (see Figure [\ref=FigP2P](d)).

For Email network, we have observed strong fluctuation of PageRank value when βi is inversely proportional to the degree of vertex i (see Figure [\ref=FigEmail](a)). When all βi are equal to one, we have seen less fluctuation of PageRank value than that in the first case (see Figure [\ref=FigEmail](b)). PageRank value also becomes proportional to the vertex degree when βi is proportional to the same (see Figure [\ref=FigEmail](c)). When βi is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex i, higher degree vertices hold higher PageRank values (see Figure [\ref=FigEmail](d)).

In PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) network, some high degree vertices fluctuate in PageRank values when βi is inversely proportional to the degree of a vertex i (see Figure [\ref=FigPGP](a)). Similar result has been found when all βi are equal to one (see Figure [\ref=FigPGP](b)). When βi is equal or proportional to the degree of vertex i, PageRank value is proportional to the same (see Figure [\ref=FigPGP](c)). PageRank value increases with the increment of degree of vertices when βi is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex i (see Figure [\ref=FigPGP]).

Internet network is comparatively stable than other networks when βi is inversely proportional to the degree of vertex i and when all βi are equal to one (see Figure [\ref=FigAS](a) and Figure [\ref=FigAS](b)). When βi is equal or proportional to the degree of vertex i, PageRank value is also proportional to the same (see Figure [\ref=FigAS](c)). When βi is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex i, high degree vertices take the high PageRank score (see Figure [\ref=FigAS](d)).

Localization of PageRank centrality: The extent of localization can be measured by calculating inverse participation ratio (IPR) [\cite=Kawamoto16] [\cite=Martin14]. The IPR of a PageRank vector [formula] is calculated as:

[formula]

When IPR is of order O(1) as n  →    ∞  , the PageRank vector [formula] is localized. If IPR →  0, [formula] is delocalized [\cite=Goltsev12] [\cite=Kawamoto16].

We observe that random and small-world network do not show localization of PageRank centrality. In these two networks, the lowest IPRs observe when β is inversely proportional to the degree of vertex and the highest IPRs observe when β is the square of the degree of the vertices (see Figure [\ref=ipr] (A) and [\ref=ipr] (B)). However, in scale-free network the PageRank is localized and the highest IPR is observed when β is proportional to the square of the degree of a vertex and the lowest IPR is observed when all βi are equal to one (see Figure [\ref=ipr] (C)).

In Blogs network, the PageRank is localized and the highest IPR is observed when the value of β is inversely proportional to the degree of the vertices. The lowest value of IPR is seen when β is proportional to the degree of the vertex (see Figure [\ref=ipr] (D)).

The PageRank is not localized in P2P and Email networks. In both of these networks, the highest value of IPRs are observed when β is proportional to the square of the degree of vertex and the lowest IPR is observed when all βi are equal to one (see Figure [\ref=ipr] (E) and [\ref=ipr] (F)).

The PageRank is localized in PGP network and the highest value IPR is observed when β is proportional to the square of the degree and the lowest IPR is seen when β is proportional to the degree of the vertex (see Figure [\ref=ipr] (G)).

In Internet network, PageRank centrality is localized. The highest value of IPR is observed when β is the square of the degree of the network and the lowest IPR is observed when β is proportional to the degree of the vertex (see Figure [\ref=ipr] (H)).

Discussion and conclusion

In this work, we have shown that PageRank centrality depends upon intrinsic, non-network contribution of the vertices. If the intrinsic and non-network contribution of the vertices is proportional to the degree then PageRank score becomes proportional to the degree of the vertices. We have also shown that if the intrinsic and non-network contribution of PageRank centrality is zero, then it also becomes proportional to the degree of the network. Our numerical simulation of three network models (Erdös-Rényi random network, Watts-Strogatz small-world network and Barabási-Albert scale-free network) shows that the PageRank scores are more resilient in the intrinsic and non-network contribution in small-world and scale-free networks than in the random network. Among all real-world networks studied here, Blog, P2P, E-mail and PGP, PageRank score fluctuates heavily when intrinsic and non-network contribution are either inversely proportional to the degree or equal to one. When the value of β is proportional to degree, PageRank keeps the same proportional value. High degree vertices possess high PageRank value when the β is proportional to the square of the degree. Internet network shows very small fluctuation of PageRank score when β is either inversely proportional or equal to one and for other two values of β show similar result as other real networks.

On the contrary to the common belief we show that PageRank centrality can show localization for some networks and the extent of localization depends upon the intrinsic and non-network contribution of the PageRank centrality. In synthetic networks, we have seen that the value of IPR increases with the increase in the value of β. However, in the real-world networks studied here, no such correlation is found. In Blog network, IPR attains the highest value when β is inversely proportional to the degree and for other networks the highest value of IPR was observed when β is proportion to the square of the degree. In a nutshell, we have observed that the intrinsic and non-network contribution plays an important role in PageRank centrality calculation.

Here, we have considered the underlying undirected structure of all the networks. The giant component (i.e., the largest connected sub-network) has been considered when the network is not connected.
