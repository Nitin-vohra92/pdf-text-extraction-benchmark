Thermal ignition revisited with molecular dynamics: role of fluctuations in activated collisions

Introduction

Ignition phenomena are central to combustion problems [\cite=Williams1985]. Experimentally, hot-spot ignition is generally observed at low temperatures close to 1000K [\cite=meyer1971shock], with ignition delays typically lower than predicted from classical chemical kinetic descriptions in a homogeneous system. Recently, detailed experiments suggest that spark induced ignition, for example, is an intrinsically stochastic process [\cite=bane2010] when observed at the continuum scale.

It has been proposed that the source of stochasticity in ignition phenomena may be attributed to fluctuations within the reactive medium, ranging from thermal fluctuations, to fluctuations in the number of activated collisions yielding ignition, hydrodynamic fluctuations from macroscopic effects [\cite=borisov1974origin] and hydrodynamic instabilities. Departures from equilibrium have also been considered, especially for small-scale systems [\cite=gorecki1987adiabatic] [\cite=lemarchand2004enhanced].

Previous authors have demonstrated that exothermicity can play a strong role in introducing non-equilibrium effects and modifying the macroscopic rate of reactions from that obtained from the standard kinetic theory evaluation assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g., see [\cite=Vincenti&Kruger1975]). Some of the earliest work by Prigogine and Xhrouet [\cite=prigogine1949perturbation] estimated the change of the reaction rate by perturbation of the Maxwellian distribution for reactions with low levels of heat release, concluding that the non-equilibrium reaction rate is lower than the equilibrium rate for low activation energies.

In contrast, Prigogine and Mahieu [\cite=prigogine1950perturbation] demonstrated that the inclusion of a sufficiently large heat of reaction can yield a non-equilibrium reaction rate larger than the one derived with the assumption of local equilibrium, using the same perturbation method. Similar results have been reported by others using comparable perturbation methods to a reactive system, demonstrating the roles that both activation energy and heat release in exothermic reactions have on the departure from equilibrium [\cite=present1968chapman] [\cite=ross1961some] [\cite=shizgal1970nonequilibrium].

Microscopic models have been used to investigate the role that fluctuations and non-equilibrium effects have on reactive systems, whereby such models naturally account for fluctuations in reactive systems. Such studies have been conducted using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations [\cite=Chou&Yip1984] [\cite=Gorecki&Gorecka2000] [\cite=gorecki1987adiabatic] and models using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [\cite=lemarchand2004enhanced] [\cite=lemarchand2004fluctuation] [\cite=mansour1992microscopic] [\cite=nowakowski2002thermal] [\cite=dziekan2012particle]. Recently, models involving Landau's fluctuating hydrodynamics formalism [\cite=Landau&Lifshitz1959] that bridges the molecular and continuum descriptions have been formulated to address problems in reactive systems [\cite=bhattacharjee2015fluctuating], although the authors argue that particle based models are still needed in order to capture physics at the molecular scale.

Despite the extent of the previous work, few studies have addressed the arguments made by Borisov [\cite=borisov1974origin] regarding the role that fluctuations and hot-spot formations have on the ignition delay in auto-ignition phenomena. In the present work we address these issues by revisiting the classical problem of thermal ignition [\cite=Williams1985] via molecular dynamic simulations in a simplified binary system of reactive gases. The MD description used in the present paper addresses the potential role of spatial non-homogeneities in the ignition problem, which is typically more difficult to consider in a continuum description using corrections of the type initiated by Prigogine and co-workers[\cite=prigogine1949perturbation], as discussed above.

We thus report the results obtained from microscopic simulations of the molecular dynamics using the hard particle method with activated reactive collisions. Such hard particle models are attractive to study because of the very low computational price, compared with more realistic inter-particle force potentials. Since the pioneering work of Alder and Wainright [\cite=Alder&Wainright1959], the dynamics of hard particles can be solved by solely solving for the time of collisions among different pair of particles, where each successive collision can be predicted analytically. The system is evolved from collision to collision, or event to event, hence the name of the algorithm, the Event Driven Molecular Dynamics method (EDMD). The method can be readily applied to hundreds of thousands of particles on today's personal computers. Not surprisingly, the first molecular dynamic investigations of non-equilibrium reactive phenomena, such as ignition [\cite=Chou&Yip1984] and detonation wave propagation [\cite=Kawakatsu_etal1988] were conducted using the EDMD method, albeit with a limited number of particles.

The present paper uses similar reactive dynamics assumed in these earlier papers to study the problem of homogeneous thermal ignition and compare with the predictions made from the continuum description, where the reaction rate is evaluated from classical kinetic theory arguments assuming local equilibrium [\cite=Vincenti&Kruger1975]. Calculations are done in a fixed volume, where the thermal ignition problem in the continuum is well understood [\cite=Williams1985]. The investigation is limited to two-dimensional hard particles for ease of visualization of the dynamics and the identification of non-homogeneous effects.

The paper is organized as follows. In the first part, we present a description of the reactive system we are investigating, with the details regarding the MD simulations and the continuum description. In the second part, the results from MD are compared with those obtained from the continuum description in order to draw a conclusion of whether molecular fluctuations may be responsible for departures from homogeneous ignition and changes in the ignition delay times.

Methodology

Model Description

The present model assumes an irreversible exothermic reaction of the form

[formula]

in which only collisions among the reactants A and B can yield two product species C. This reactive model is similar to that presented by previous authors [\cite=Chou&Yip1984] [\cite=mansour1992microscopic] [\cite=gorecki1987adiabatic] [\cite=Gorecki&Gorecka2000], with modified chemistry to allow for depletion of two distinct reactants (i.e., fuel and oxidizer). Such a description is desirable since fluctuations of species can be considered, and gives the flexibility of varying the ratio of reactants to study the effect of dilution on ignition.

The model assumes NA and NB number of type A and B reactive particles, respectively. Particles have a diameter d occupying a prescribed volume fraction η within a 2D fixed domain. In the reactive collision, each existing particle A and B transform into two reacted particles C. All collisions are assumed to be elastic with the exception of a reactive collision, which gives an amount of chemical energy Q to each reacted particle in order to increase their kinetic energies. The changes in speeds of the reacting particles after impact occur along the line of action, while the tangential components remain unchanged. A schematic of this process is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Collision_model]. Reactive collisions are only permitted if the collision between particles A and B is sufficiently strong, i.e., when the relative normal velocities are greater than a threshold velocity umax, such that:

[formula]

This velocity prescribes the activation energy of the system, which for the 2D system takes the form

[formula]

Molecular Dynamics Details

The MD model was established by implementing the collision rules for reactive and non-reactive encounters into an Event Driven Molecular Dynamics algorithm, as described by Pöschel and Schwager [\cite=Poschel&Schwager2005]. For each simulation, NA and NB disks of diameter d are initialized in a square domain with equal velocities and randomized trajectories. Collisions with the boundaries were treated as elastic. The particles were let to thermalize and obtain Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics prior to allowing them to undergo reactive collisions. Time zero marks this sudden allowance of reactive collisions. This can be thaught of as the sudden heating by a shock wave [\cite=meyer1971shock], while neglecting the non-equilibrium effects during the shock compression itself. The evolution of temperature and species for the entire domain was output at prescribed time intervals. Validation of the numerical implementation can be found elsewhere [\cite=Sirmasetal2012] [\cite=Sirmas2015].

Homogeneous Ignition at the continuum level

The results obtained using the molecular dynamic description detailed above were compared with those obtained from a continuum description assuming a homogeneous system. For constant volume evolution, only the evolution of the system's partition of energy and composition applies [\cite=Williams1985]:

[formula]

[formula]

where YC and ωC are the mass fraction of products C and their production rate, respectively. The reaction rate ωC for activated reactions can be obtained from classic kinetic theory arguments [\cite=Vincenti&Kruger1975] if one makes the standard assumption of local Maxwell Boltzmann equilibrium and a homogeneous system. For the two-dimensional system of the present study, it takes the form[\cite=sirmas2014evolution]:

[formula]

where YA, and YB are the mass fractions of reactants A and B, respectively, with the pair correlation function

[formula]

The described system characterized by five parameters, the volume fraction η, the specific heat cv = R for a 2D hard particle system, the initial temperature T0 and the parameters Q and EA. When non-dimensionalized, the parameters η, Q / RT0 and EA / RT0 uniquely characterize the system's evolution.

Parameters and Scaling

For the current study we consider a system in the dilute, ideal gas regime, with a volume fraction of η = 0.01. The length scales are normalized by the mean free path in the initial gas

[formula]

The time scales are normalized by the initial mean free time, with τo  =  λ / urms(o), where urms is the root-mean-squared velocity. With such scaling, the homogeneous ignition description becomes independent of η.

We have also studied the effect of the domain size in the molecular dynamic calculations. This is achieved by looking at systems with different numbers of particles, while maintaining a constant volume fraction η. A summary of the conditions we considered are shown in Table [\ref=table:params].

Results and discussion

An example of the evolution of temperature obtained from the continuum model and from two separate realizations in MD is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Q5Ea7_5_example] for the case of Q / RTo = 5 and EA / RTo = 7.5, with NA = NB = 500 particles. While all three curves display the characteristics of thermal ignition, marked by a slow induction phase followed by a rapid thermal run-away [\cite=Williams1985], it is evident that the molecular dynamic results can have substantial differences from the continuum prediction. Furthermore, different realizations, obtained by allowing the thermalization of the gas prior to the reactive simulation to evolve for slightly different times, also yields a different outcome owing to the molecular noise.

In the subsequent discussion, the ignition delay time in a single realization is defined as the time elapsed until 50% of the available energy is released. The mean ignition delay time tig obtained from the MD calculations was obtained by averaging the ensemble of single realization ignition delay times obtained for 100 simulations. The ignition delay obtained from the continuum model assuming a homogeneous mixture with negligible fluctuations is defined as tig,h.

We first consider the case where the number of one reactant far exceeds the other, i.e., the diluted case. Figure [\ref=fig:Q7_5_diffconcentrations] shows the Arrhenius plot for ignition delay time for the mixture 9A  +  B, for different domain sizes with Q / RTo = 7.5 and varying EA. Results for this diluted case show that for sufficiently large domains, with totals of 1000 and 10000 particles, results for tig agree well with tig,h, with a slight discrepancy at the high temperature on the order of one mean free time. However, for the smaller domain of 100 particles, the domain is too small to capture the correct ignition delay, giving higher than expected values.

The non-diluted case is however more interesting. Figure [\ref=fig:Q7_5_diffN] shows the results obtained for the different domain sizes with Q / RTo = 7.5 and varying EA for the mixture A  +  B. Results show clear differences between the ignition times expected from homogeneous ignition and those obtained via MD. At low activation energies, MD results for all domain sizes give an ignition time greater than for homogeneous ignition, similar to what was observed for the diluted case above. At these activation energies, the results show that tig is independent on the domain size. However, results show a dependency on the domain size as the activation energy is increased. For a small domain size, with N = 100, we see that tig from MD is larger than tig,h for all values of activation energy. For larger domain sizes, with N = 1000 and 10000, the ignition time obtained from MD exceeds the estimate from the continuum model for smaller EA, but becomes lower than the continuum prediction for larger values of EA. Figures [\ref=fig:compare_MDv0D](a)-(d) show how tig compares with tig,h for varying values of Q and EA, for N = 1000. The difference and relative difference between tig and tig,h are shown for these cases in Figures [\ref=fig:error](a)-(b).

At low activation energies, tig was found larger than tig,h for the heat release parameters investigated. In Figure [\ref=fig:error](a) it can be seen that for EA / RTo = 1.25 - 3.75 the difference between tig and tig,h is independent of heat release, with MD yielding a longer ignition delay by approximately 1-3τo. Results show that the heat release has a stronger effect on the difference between tig and tig,h as the activation energy increases further. At EA / RTo = 5.0, results for Q / RTo = 5,7.5 and 10 show a transition whereby tig is lower than tig,h, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:error](a). This transition occurs between EA / RTo = 6.25 and 7.5 for Q / RTo = 2.5. As EA increases after these transitions, larger values of Q give a larger difference between tig and tig,h. This can clearly be seen at EA / RTo = 7.5 where Q / RTo = 2.5 yields tig being approximately 5τo less than tig,h, whereas results for Q / RTo = 10 gives a tig approximately 23τo less than tig,h. The relative differences for these two cases are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:error](b), representing differences of approximately 1% and 30%, respectively. These results show that a higher heat release compared to activation energy favours a greater departure from an equilibrium homogeneous ignition, and thus yield a larger reaction rate.

The example evolution shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Q5Ea7_5_example] shows that no single MD simulation will be identical, which can be attributed to the statistical fluctuations within the systems. In order to quantify the differences, the standard deviation for the ensemble averaged ignition time was calculated over the 100 simulations. The error bars shown in Figure [\ref=fig:compare_MDv0D] for each of the data points represent the standard deviation over all simulations. Figure [\ref=fig:var2] shows the standard deviation normalized by tig for the cases presented in Figure [\ref=fig:compare_MDv0D].

Results show that for constant Q, the standard deviation increases with increasing EA. At low values of EA, the standard deviation is not influenced by the heat release significantly. However, for increasing values of EA, the standard deviation increases with Q. These results show that statistical fluctuations become important with increasing Q and EA, yielding less predictable ignition times.

In order to gain more insight on the behavior at low and high activation energies, we now turn to observing the reactions at the molecular level. First we consider the case with low activation energy, where MD simulations show an ignition delay higher than predicted by the homogeneous continuum model with local equilibrium. Figure [\ref=fig:Q2_5Ea2_5] shows a sequence of images showing the generation of products for EA / RTo = 2.5 and Q / RTo = 2.5 for N = 10000 particles (see supplementary material for a video of these events). Product molecules under these conditions are shown to appear homogeneously about the systems. Tracking the reacted particles, a single reactive event does not dictate where the next reaction will occur, as the energy liberated has sufficient time to be communicated to a large sample of particles. These results show that the homogeneous assumption still applies, explaining why different domain sizes yield the same ignition delay, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Q7_5_diffN]. However, although the spatial heterogenieties are negligible, the thermal run-away makes the reactions occur faster than required to maintain Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, thereby decreasing the effective reaction rate, thus confirming the mechanism of Prigogine and Xhrouet [\cite=prigogine1949perturbation].

For high activation energies, however, MD simulations show an ignition delay lower than predicted for a homogeneous ignition in local equilibrium. This is consistent with experiment of shock-induced ignition [\cite=meyer1971shock] [\cite=gardner2005]. Figure [\ref=fig:Q105Ea7_5] shows a sequence of images showing the generation of products for EA / RTo = 7.5 and Q / RTo = 10 with N = 10000 particles (see supplementary material for a video of these events). In this case it can clearly be seen that the system is non-homogeneous, with reactions initially occurring in few distinct 'hot-spots' with higher kinetic energy. This is attributable to the statistical fluctuations of the disks. By tracking the particles, it can be seen that most subsequent reactions are more likely to occur near previous reactions, owing to these hot-spots growing. The characteristic time of energy deposition is now shorter than the time to distribute the energy among a sufficiently large sample of molecules. The non-homogeneity at higher activation energies and heat release confirms what is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Q7_5_diffN] where larger systems react faster, owing to the probability of having hot-spots with sufficient energy to commence a sequence of reactions locally. The appearance of hot-spots in systems with large activation energies is also in very good agreement with experiment [\cite=meyer1971shock] [\cite=gardner2005].

Conclusion

We addressed the problem of thermal ignition in a model 2D molecular system to address the role played by fluctuations on ignition delay and homogeneity of the process. For sufficiently large activation energies and heat release parameters, we find that the ignition delay obtained from the molecular dynamic simulations can be significantly shorter than predicted at the continuum level assuming a reaction rate derived from standard kinetic theory assuming local equilibrium. Likewise, we find that the fluctuations between different realizations increase with the activation energy, showing that the thermal ignition phenomenon is a genuine stochastic process when observed at the continuum level. Analysis of the evolution of single realizations also revealed departures from the homogeneous assumption as activation energy increases, demonstrating that ignition may be due to hot-spot formations at high activation energies. The results obtained are in good agreement with experimental observations of auto-ignition at relatively low temperatures, where hot-spot ignition and associated lower ignition delays than predicted are generally observed.
