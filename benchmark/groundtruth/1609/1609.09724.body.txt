Lemma

Distinguishing Galois representations by their normalized traces

Introduction

Let f be a Hecke eigenform of weight k on Γ1(N). For a prime [formula], denote by ap(f) the eigenvalue of the Hecke operator Tp at  p. In ([\cite=R]), refinements of the strong multiplicity one theorem for Hecke eigenforms are given, where one compares the Hecke eigenvalues for two modular forms f1 and f2.

In the context of automorphic representations, it is convenient to work with the normalized Hecke eigenvalue, ãp(f):  =  ap(f)  /  p(k - 1) / 2. This has the effect that the L-function associated to the 'normalized' system of eigenvalues satisfies a functional equation of the form s  ↔  1 - s.

In a recent article ([\cite=MP]), Murty and Pujahari prove a refinement of the strong multiplicity one theorem for the normalized eigenvalues associated to Hecke eigenforms:

Suppose f1 and f2 be two non-CM Hecke eignenforms of weights k1 and k2 respectively. Let S be the set of primes p not dividing the levels of f1 and f2, such that ãp(f1)  =  ãp(f2).

If the upper density of S is positive, then k1  =  k2, and f1 and f2 are twists of each other by a Dirichlet character.

The proof by Murty and Pujahari uses the work of Harris, Taylor and others on Sato-Tate conjecture and is analytic in nature.

In this article, we prove an analogous theorem in the context of pure Galois representations. This is a variation of an algebraic Chebotarev theorem proved in [\cite=R].

Using Galois representations attached to modular forms we deduce the above mentioned result of Murty and Pujahari. Our methods also yield a similar result for Hilber modular forms.

Theorem

Let K be a global field, and GK: = Gal(q / K) denote the absolute Galois group over K of a separable closure q of K. For a finite place v of K, let Nv denote the cardinality of the residue field at v, Let ΣK denote the set of finite places of K.

Let [formula] be a rational prime coprime to the characteristic of K and let F be a [formula]-adic local field of characteristic zero. Let ρ: ~ GK  →  GLn(F) be a continuous representation of GK. Since we want to recover the representation from a knowledge of its traces, we will assume throughout that the representations considered are semisimple.

We will assume that ρ is unramified outside a finite set of places of K. At a finite place v of K where ρ is unramified, let σv denote the Frobenius conjugacy class in the quotient group GK  /  Ker(ρ). If L is a finite extension of K, then we denote by ρ|L the restriction of the representation ρ to the subgroup GL  ⊂  GK.

Let E be a number field. Define a [formula]-adic representation ρ to be E-valued, if the characteristic polynomials of the Frobenius conjugacy classes at unramified primes of ρ has coefficients in E.

Define the algebraic monodromy group G attached to ρ to be the smallest algebraic subgroup G of GLn defined over F such that ρ(GK)  ⊂  G(F). This is also the Zariski closure of ρ(GK) in G(F).

A Dirichlet character, is a character χ of GK into * of finite order.

Consider the [formula]-adic Tate module of [formula], defined as [formula], where [formula] is the group of [formula]-roots of unity in q*. This is a GK-module and denote by ω its character. For a prime v of K with residue characteristic not equal to [formula], we have ω(σv) = Nv. The character ω is the cyclotomic character acting on the roots of unity, and is also the inverse of the Tate twist.

Let ρ1, ρ2 be E-valued [formula]-adic Galois representations of GK. Let k1 and k2 be integers. Let S v of K unramified for ρ1 and ρ2 such that Tr(ρ1(σv) / Nvk1 / 2)  =  Tr(ρ2(σv) / Nvk2 / 2). Suppose that the Zariski closure H1 of the image ρ1(GK) in GLr is a connected algebraic group.

If the upper density of S is positive, then k1 = k2 + 2r for some integer r and there is a finite extension L of K, such that

[formula]

If in addition, ρ1 is absolutely irreducible, then there is a Dirichlet character χ of GK, such that

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]

Let ρ be a [formula]-adic Galois representations of GK. Assume that the algebraic monodromy group G of ρ is connected. Then the set V of places v of ΣK which is unramified for ρ and where Tr(ρ(σv))  =  0 is of density zero.

Consider the variety

[formula]

This is a closed subvariety in GLn and closed under conjugation. By the algebraic Chebotarev theorem [\cite=R], the set V has density equal to the ratio of the number of connected components of G contained inside X to the total number of connected components of G. The connected component of identity of G cannot be contained in X, since the trace of the identity element is n. Since G is connected, this proves the proposition.

We now observe that k1 and k2 have the same parity. Let [formula] be the set of places v∈S such that Tr(ρ1(Frobv))  ≠  0 and Tr(ρ2(Frobv))  ≠  0. By the above proposition the upper density of [formula] equals the upper density of S and is positive.

Let S'1 denote the subset of places of S' which is of degree one over [formula]. Since the set of places of a number field K of degree one over the rationals is of density one in K, it follows that the upper density of S'1 is positive. For [formula],

[formula]

Furthermore, by our assumtion that the representations are E-valued, it follows that Nv(k1  -  k2) / 2  =  p(k1  -  k2) / 2∈E for a set of primes of positive density. This forces that k1 and k2 to have the same parity. Let 2r  =  k1  -  k2.

Consider now the two representations, ρ1 and [formula]. By our assumption, for v∈S,

[formula]

We recall the following theorem proved in [\cite=R]:

Let ρ1, ρ2 be [formula]-adic Galois representations. Let SM(ρ1,ρ2) be the set of places v of K such that Tr(ρ1(σv))  =  Tr(ρ2(σv)).

Assume that the Zariski closure H1 of the image ρ1(GK) in GLr is a connected algebraic group, and the upper density of SM(ρ1,ρ2) is positive. Then there exists a finite extension L of K such that ρ2|L≃ρ1|L.

If in addition ρ1 is absolutely irreducible, then there exists a Dirichlet character χ of GK, such that [formula].

Since Equation [\ref=eqtraces] holds at the set of places v∈S which has positive density, and by our hypothesis, Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] follows from the foregoing theorem.

Application to modular forms

We first recall some well known facts about modular forms. Let N, ~ k be natural numbers, and f a newform of level N, weight k and Nebentypus character ε. By a theorem of Shimura, it is known that the field E generated by the Hecke eigenvalues [formula] is a number field. By theorems of Eichler, Shimura, Ihara, Deligne and Serre, given any rational prime [formula], there is a [formula]-adic local field F  ⊃  E, and a two dimensional Galois representation [formula] unramified outside N, such that for primes [formula],

[formula]

By theorems of Serre and Ribet, it is known that if the form f is non-CM, then the algebraic monodromy group is isomorphic to GL2.

We deduce now Theorem [\ref=MP] from Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]. Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=MP], by Theorem [\ref=maintheorem], we conclude that k1 = k2 + 2r for some integer r, and there exists a Dirichlet character χ of [formula] such that

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=mf] proved below, r = 0, and hence Theorem [\ref=MP] follows.

Given a Hecke eigenform g∈Sk(N), L(g,s), the L-function associated to g is given by

[formula]

It has an Euler product expansion given by

[formula]

where Ep(g,s) is the Euler factor at p depending on p dividing N or not. For a natural number M divisible by N, define the partial L-function,

[formula]

The completed Λ function defined by Λ(g,s)  =  Ns / 2(2π)- sΓ(s)L(g,s) satisfies the functional equation of the form:

[formula]

where λ(g) is a non-zero complex number and Γ(s) is the Γ-function. Thus L(g,s) satisfies a functional equation of the form

[formula]

where Ag(s) is a very specific entire function of s that is nowhere zero.

We give a proof of the following folklore fact (see also ([\cite=MM]):

Suppose f1 and f2 be two Hecke eignenforms of weights k1 and k2 and levels N1 and N2, respectively. Suppose there exists a non-negative integer r, such that k1 = k2 + 2r and [formula], where ω is a [formula]-adic Tate character. Then r = 0.

We rephrase our assumptions: We are given two cusps forms f1 and f2 belonging to Sk1(N1) and Sk2(N2) respectively such that their p-th Fourier coefficients for primes [formula] differ by the pr. Let [formula]. For p co-prime to N, we have ap(f1)  =  ap(f2)pr. Since k1  =  k2 + 2r, Thus, we get:

[formula]

Let us recall the functional equations satisfied by L(f1,s) and L(f2,s - r):

[formula]

[formula]

Dividing ([\ref=eq:FEf1]) by ([\ref=eq:FEf2]) we get:

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:Lf1-Lf2]) with s replaced by k1  -  s and the Γ-function identity, [formula] for m  =  r, in ([\ref=eq:5]), we get:

[formula]

We re-write the above equation as

[formula]

The right hand side of ([\ref=eq:7]) can be written as a product of a nowhere zero entire function and a quotient of finite Euler products:

[formula]

where a, ~ b are natural numbers, and αi, ~ 1  ≤  i  ≤  a and βj, ~ 1  ≤  j  ≤  b are some complex numbers and pi are prime numbers dividing N. Here A(s) is a nowhere vanishing entire function, and λ is a non-zero constant.

We now claim that r  =  0. Let us assume the contrary.

Note that there is no cancellation of terms between the numerator and the denominator on the left hand side. For otherwise, for some 1  ≤  j1,j2  ≤  r, we have k1  =  j1  +  j2  ≤  2r, which is a contradiction as k1  -  2r  =  k2  >  0.

This implies that the right hand side has to have a zero, in turn forcing the existance of a term of the form (1  -  αipi- s) for some i and some non-zero αi. Note that any such term has an infinitely many zeros [formula] for [formula]. This is a contradiction as there are only a finitely many zeroes to the left hand side.

Thus, to sum up, examining the zeros of the two sides of Equation ([\ref=eq:7]), we conclude that r = 0 and k1  =  k2, and this proves the proposition.

A different way of looking at this result is to use the fact that the Galois representation attached to a modular form of weight k, arises from a motive with Hodge weights (0,k - 1),(k - 1,0). Twisting by the cyclotomic character ωr (equivalently by a Tate twist - r-times), the Hodge weights are of the form (r,k - 1 + r),(k - 1 + r,r). Thus, if the twisted representation has to arise from a newform, then r = 0.

Another way of seeing the validity of Proposition [\ref=mf] is to consider the automorphic representations attached to the cusp forms f1 and [formula]. By the strong multiplicity one theorem of Piatetskii-Shapiro and Jacquet-Shalika, the corresponding automorphic representations are isomorphic. The weight of the modular form is given by the discrete series, the component at infinity of the corresponding automorphic representation. Hence it follows that r = 0.

The above proof allows one to prove analogues of Theorem [\ref=MP], in the context of Hilbert modular forms, or even more generally whenever one can attach Galois representations to automorphic forms or even in a geometric context for the l-adic representations arising from cohomology of varieties defined over global fields with fixed Hodge structures.
