Remark

On the divisibility of odd perfect numbers by a high power of a prime, II

Introduction

Let σ(N) denote the sum of divisors of N for a positive integer N and define h(N) = σ(N) / N. An integer N is called to be perfect if h(N) = 2. It is one of oldest and most infamous problems whether there exists any odd perfect number. Moreover, it is also unknown whether there exists any odd integer N with h(N) = k for some integer k > 1.

Although it is unknown that whether there exists any odd perfect number, it is known that an odd perfect number must satisfy various conditions. Suppose that N is an odd perfect number. Euler has shown that [formula], where [formula] are distinct odd primes with [formula] and [formula] even. Steuerwald [\cite=St] proved that we cannot have [formula]. If [formula], then it is known that β  ≠  4 (Kanold [\cite=Ka1]), β  ≠  6 (Hagis and McDaniel [\cite=HM1]), β  ≠  10,24,34,48,124 (McDaniel and Hagis [\cite=MDH]), β  ≠  12,16,22,28,36 (Cohen and Williams [\cite=CoW]). In their paper [\cite=HM2], Hagis and McDaniel conjecture that [formula] does not occur. The author [\cite=Ymd1] proved that there are only finitely many odd perfect numbers for any given β. McDaniel [\cite=Mc1] proved that we cannot have [formula], i.e., 3 cannot divide all of [formula]. If m divides all of [formula], then it is known that m  ≠  35 (Hagis and McDaniel[\cite=HM2]) and m  ≠  65 (Evans and Pearlman[\cite=EP]).

However, if we relax the condition that there exists some integer dividing all of [formula], then the situation becomes quite different. The simplest problem in this direction would be whether there exists an odd perfect number of the form [formula] with [formula] and βi  ≤  4. This problem has been studied by McDaniel [\cite=Mc2], Cohen [\cite=Co]. These papers give lower bounds for the smallest prime factor of N: the first paper shows it must be ≥  101, the second shows it must be ≥  739.

In general, we can make a conjecture that for a fixed finite set P of integers, a fixed rational number n / d and a fixed integer s, there exist only finitely many odd n / d-perfect numbers [formula] with [formula] contained in P.

This conjecture still seems to be far beyond reach, though this conjecture is weaker than the finiteness (or non-existence) conjecture of odd n / d-perfect numbers. In the preprint [\cite=Ymd2], using sieve methods, the author has proved that for an fixed finite set P of integers, a fixed rational number n / d and a fixed integer s, there exists an effective constant C such that odd n / d-perfect numbers of the form [formula] with [formula] contained in P must have a prime divisor smaller than C. Moreover, the author has proved that, in the case N is perfect and βi  ≤  4, then C can be taken to be exp (4.97401  ×  1010).

Using the author's method, but with the aid of the large sieve instead of Selberg's sieve used by the author [\cite=Ymd1], Fletcher, Nielsen and Ochem[\cite=FNO] proved that, if [formula] satisfies h(N) = n / d and for each i, βi + 1 has a prime factor belonging to a finite set P of primes, then N has a prime divisor small than a effective constant C, depending only on n,s and P. Moreover, they proved that the smallest prime factor of an odd perfect number N satisfying the above contidion with P  =  {3,5} lies between 108 and 101000, improving results in [\cite=Co] and [\cite=Ymd2].

However, they did not give an explicit value for C in other cases. In this paper, the author would like to give an explicit upper bound for C in general cases.

Let P be a finite set of primes and [formula] be positive integers such that for any [formula], βi + 1 is divisible by at least one prime in a set P and let P denote the product [formula]. Define ΩP(x) to be the number of prime factors of x which belongs to P, counting multiplicity. Furthermore, let

[formula]

and C0 be the maximum among quantities 2(d + 1)s,x2 = x2(l) and

[formula]

with l running over all primes in P.

If [formula] satisfies [formula], then N has a prime factor smaller than C0.

It would be notable that our upper bound is the order of exponential of [formula], rather than double-exponential of [formula] as in Theorem 3 of [\cite=FNO].

It would also be notable that no absolute upper bound is known for the smallest prime factor of a general odd perfect number if it exists at all; another known result is Grün's result[\cite=Gru] that the smallest prime factor must be smaller than [formula], where ω(N) denotes the number of distinct prime factors of N.

Distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions

In order to make our upper bound explicit, we need some explicit results on primes in arithmetic progressions.

Chen and Wang [\cite=ChW] proved that if x  ≥   exp  exp 9.7,k  ≤   log 3x and χ is a Dirichlet character modulo k, then

[formula]

where β denotes a real zero of χ greater than 1 - 0.1077 /  log k and E = 1 if it exists (For more general results, see the author's recent paper [\cite=Ymd3]).

Since Theorem 3 of [\cite=LW] gives that β  ≤  1 - π / 0.4923k1 / 2 log 2k, we see that if k  ≤   log x and x  ≥   exp  exp 13.3, then

[formula]

In other words, putting x0  =   exp  max {k, exp 13.3}, the inequality ([\ref=eq20]) holds for x  ≥  x0.

Based on this inequality, we shall prove the following estimates.

Let w,z be an arbitrary real number with z  ≥  w  ≥  x0. Then the inequality

[formula]

and

[formula]

holds.

Moreover, if z  ≥  x1010, then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We begin by noting that ([\ref=eq20]) yields

[formula]

for x  ≥  x0.

Now we shall prove ([\ref=eq22a]) and ([\ref=eq22b]). By partial summation, we have

[formula]

for z > w  ≥  x0 and obtain ([\ref=eq22a]). In particular, we have

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

for z  ≥  x0, which gives ([\ref=eq22b]).

Nextly, we shall prove ([\ref=eq21b]). Similarly to above, partial summation gives

[formula]

By the Brun-Titchmarsh theorem given in [\cite=MV], we have

[formula]

We can easiy see that ([\ref=eq26]) gives

[formula]

Inserting these upper bounds into ([\ref=eq27]) yields

[formula]

for z  ≥  x1010, giving ([\ref=eq21b]).

Finally, ([\ref=eq21a]) immediately follows by using the partial summation

[formula]

and ([\ref=eq26]).

Upper bound sieve

Another result that we need is a standard result in large sieve theory. However, for convenience to compute explicit bounds, we must use an explicit (but a little sophisticated) upper bound sieve formula. There are several explicit upper bound sieve formulae to obtain explicit upper bound for the implied constant in an upper bound sieve. In [\cite=Ymd2], the author used the upper bound formula following from Selberg's sieve. But here we shall use the large sieve formula used by Fletcher, Nielsen and Ochem[\cite=FNO], which enabled them to obtain a considerably stronger estimate than in the author's paper [\cite=Ymd2].

Firstly, we would like to introduce some notations. Let A and Ωp, where p is an arbitrary prime number, be sets of residue classes mod p, B be a positive integer, X be a real number, and ρ(n) be a multiplicative arithmetic function satisfying [formula] for any prime p. Denote by Ad the set of positive integers in A which belongs to Ωp for any p dividing d. Define and where p runs over primes. Finally, we define S(A,P) = S(A,P,Ω) to be the number of integers in A which does not belong to Ωp for any prime p dividing P.

Now we introduce two lemmas concerning the large sieve inequality. These inequalities allow us to calculate an upper bound in Theorem [\ref=thm1] explicitly.

It holds for any u  ≥  1 that

[formula]

This is Theorem 7.14 in p.p.180-181 in [\cite=IK].

Let us denote s

[formula]

and

[formula]

(we believe that this ψ can easily be distinguished from the second Chebyshev prime-counting function).

If v = ( log x) / ( log z)  ≥  B(z), then we have

[formula]

where v = ( log x) / ( log z) and

[formula]

This is Theorem 2.2.1 in p. 52 of [\cite=Gre] if we take B =  sup zB(z) instead of B(z). But we can see that this theorem still holds with B replaced by B(z). Indeed, it follows from the argument in p.p. 53-54 in [\cite=Gre] that

[formula]

for any constant c  ≥  0. Setting [formula] and c =  log v -  log B(z), we obtain the lemma.

Proof of the main result

We may assume that P  ≥  21 by virtue of the result in [\cite=FNO] concerning to the case P  =  {2,4} mentioned in the introduction of this paper. Let [formula] be a solution of [formula] and let us denote [formula]. If N has a prime divisor in P, then clearly N has a prime factor smaller than C0. We may assume without loss of generality that N has no prime divisor in P and therefore ΩP(N) = 0.

Let Ql denote by the set of primes qi with βi + 1 is divisible by l. By assumption, any qi belongs to Ql for some l in P.

Now we prove a result concerning the distribution of prime factors of N, which is the most important lemma in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Let κ,x1 = x1(l),x2 = x2(l) be the constant defined by Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Moreover, let v be a real number > 4.02 and y be an arbitrary real number ≥  x2. If N has no prime factor ≤  y, then we have

[formula]

where B1 = e0.11 - γ log x1 and ξ(v) = 1 -  exp ( - ψ(2.01,v / 2)).

Let U be the set of primes congruent to 1 mod P or congruent to 1 mod l and ≤  y except primes dividing nN / d.

Let r be a prime in U. Then, since [formula], there are l - 1 congruent classes [formula] belonging to order l. Since r does not divide σ(ql - 1i), qi belongs to none of l classes [formula].

Now we can apply the sieve method described in the previous section with A the set of integers ≤  x, X = x, Ωr the set of integers ≤  x belongs to any of congruent classes [formula] for r∈U and 0 mod r for [formula], ρ(r) = l for r∈U and ρ(r) = 1 for [formula]. Thus we see that if q is a prime greater than [formula] in Ql, then [formula], where [formula] denotes the product of primes in U below u. Hence we have

[formula]

Observing that [formula] for [formula], Lemmas [\ref=lm21] and [\ref=lm23] with [formula] gives

[formula]

where we put [formula].

Now we need to obtain an upper bound for the quantity V(P(z)) / ψ0(v). There are two cases: x  ≥  yv, i.e. z  ≥  y and x < yv, i.e. z < y. In both cases, we shall obtain firstly an upper bound for B(z) and nextly V(P(z)).

We begin by considering the case z  ≥  y. By ([\ref=eq21a]) and ([\ref=eq21b]), observing that y  ≥  x2  ≥  x1011 and using the estimate [formula] in [\cite=RS], we obtain

[formula]

In other words, we have

[formula]

Nextly, we shall obtain an upper bound for V(P(z)). There must be at most ΩP(nN) = ΩP(n) prime factors qi in T since if qi∈T, then σ(qβii) must be divisible by βi + 1 and therefore by some l in P. Since N is assumed to have no prime factor ≤  y, the number of distinct prime factors of σ(N) = nN / d congruent to 1 mod P or ≤  y is at most s0 = s + ω(n) + ΩP(n).

Thus we conclude that U consists of all primes [formula] in T except at most s0 primes. Hence, using ([\ref=eq22a]), ([\ref=eq22b]) and the well-known formula of Mertens in the form [formula] in [\cite=RS], we have

[formula]

and therefore, recalling that x1  =   max { exp  max {l, exp 13.3},10s0(l - 1) + 1},

[formula]

Since B(z) < 2.01  ≤  v / 2 by ([\ref=eq32a]), we have ψ0(v) = ξ(v) and therefore

[formula]

The treatment of the remaining case z < y is simpler. Similarly to the first case, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq32b]), we have B(z)  ≤  2.01 < v / 2 and therefore, similarly to the first case, ([\ref=eq33b]) gives

[formula]

Now, with the aid of ([\ref=eq31]), the lemma easily follows from inequalities ([\ref=eq34a]) and ([\ref=eq34b]).

Now we shall prove Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Let z be a real number ≥   max {x2,2(d + 1)s} and assume that N has no prime factor less than z.

Since [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Let [formula], where q runs all primes in Ql. It follows from ([\ref=eq41]) that [formula] must be [formula]. Hence we have that some [formula].

Let [formula]. Since N has no prime factor less than z, Lemma [\ref=lm3] gives, taking v = 10.49,

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

This proves Theorem [\ref=thm1].
