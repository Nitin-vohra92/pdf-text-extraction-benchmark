Correlation induced second plasmon in an electron liquid

The existence of plasmons in many body systems interacting through a Coulomb potential (plasmas, electron gases, etc.) with a characteristic oscillation frequency, the plasma frequency [formula] (with the symbols having their usual meaning) was first observed by Tonks and Langmuir [\cite=Tonks1929]. Its theoretical analysis started with the work of Vlasov [\cite=Vlasov1938]. Landau's subsequent criticism [\cite=Landau1946] of some aspects of Vlasov's work led to a deeper understanding of the wave-particle interaction and the ensuing damping mechanism. The identification of the plasma oscillations as a collective excitation is due to the pioneering series of works by Bohm, Gross and Pines [\cite=Bohm1949] [\cite=*Bohm1949a] [\cite=*Bohm1953] [\cite=*Pines1952], who also introduced the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). It was also Bohm and Gross [\cite=Bohm1949] [\cite=*Bohm1949a] (BG) who determined the eponymous k - dependent positive dispersion of the plasmon, caused by the random motion of the particles. The understanding of the central role plasma oscillations play in the dynamics of the degenerate electron gas arrived through the series of contributions by Pines and Nozieres [\cite=Nozieres1958] who developed the theory of plasma oscillations in the electron gas through the application of the RPA. Following a somewhat different approach Sawada [\cite=Sawada1957] [\cite=*Sawada1957a] and Klimontovich [\cite=Klimontovich1960], arrived at similar results. Soon, however, it became clear that both the classical Vlasov treatment and its quantum equivalents [\cite=Ehrenreich1959] [\cite=*Lindhard1954], the BG collective coordinate technique, and the RPA share a common underlying theoretical foundation and are appropriate for weak coupling only. The coupling strength is defined as the ratio of the potential energy of the particles to their kinetic energy; the appropriate parameter that characterizes the coupling strength for quantum systems is rs = a / aB (a is the Wigner-Seitz radius, aB the Bohr radius). Motivated by the case of the electron gas in metals where the condition rs < 1 is mildly violated, it was Singwi and collaborators [\cite=Singwi1968] who made the first serious attempts to study the effect of strong coupling on the properties of the plasmon. It is easy to realize, though, that, protected by the Kohn sum rule [\cite=Brout1959], the plasmon is an extremely robust excitation, unaffected by correlations, i.e. the plasma frequency is rs independent. Therefore all the correlational effects are absorbed by the wave number (k) dependence of the dispersion. Prominent amongst these effects is the change of the slope of BG dispersion from positive to negative at higher coupling values.

The physics of the strongly coupled electron gas (or, rather, electron liquid) have by now been studied through a large body of theoretical (for a recent summary see [\cite=Giuliani2008]) and computer simulation works [\cite=Ceperley1978] [\cite=*Jones1996] [\cite=Ortiz1994] [\cite=*Ortiz1997] [\cite=Gori-Giorgi2000] [\cite=*Gori-Giorgi2002] [\cite=Zong2002] [\cite=Spink2013]. It is well understood that in fact the electron liquid is a binary system consisting of spin-up and spin-down components. Due to exchange, pairs of electrons with parallel or anti-parallel spin orientations correlate differently. It is this feature that leads to the possibility of different phases of the electron liquid as in the higher coupling domain the two components separate and the system becomes polarized. Computer simulations [\cite=Zong2002] show that up to rs  =  40, the electron liquid is still paramagnetic; the occurrence of a continuous second-order transition from the fully unpolarized phase to a partially polarized phase is predicted at rs  =  50  ±  2 [\cite=Zong2002] and the system becomes ferromagnetic near the Wigner lattice transition, around [formula]. Physical features of these exotic states of matter, their phase boundaries, and their static properties (notably, pair distribution functions, static structure functions, correlation energy, etc.) have been extensively investigated using improved quantum Monte Carlo methods combined with analytical calculations [\cite=Ortiz1994] [\cite=*Ortiz1997] [\cite=Gori-Giorgi2000] [\cite=*Gori-Giorgi2002] [\cite=Zong2002] [\cite=Spink2013].

A fundamental and rather obvious question, however, whether the plasmon excitation at high coupling is affected by the difference between parallel and anti-parallel spin pair correlations has not been studied. We address this question in this Letter. We point out that a strongly coupled electron liquid, with pure Coulombic interaction, should exhibit, in addition to the conventional longitudinal plasmon, an additional longitudinal excitation, a low, but finite frequency second plasmon, which is supported by the out-of-phase oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down components of the electron liquid. We emphasize that this phenomenon is not the result an explicit spin-spin interaction: such an interaction (including the commonly used phenomenological exchange induced spin-spin interaction) is absent from the model: here we are dealing with density fluctuations induced by the direct Coulomb interaction between the particles. The resulting excitation is quite distinct from the spin waves in the itinerant electron liquid. The phenomenon we discuss is expected to occur both in the spin unpolarized (paramagnetic) and partially spin polarized phases.

The collective mode structure is most prominent in the strong coupling (rs  ≫  1) domain where the collective excitations of the system are expected to exhibit a classical-like behavior, allowing a classical treatment of the dynamics. This is also corroborated by the formal invariance of the third moment sum rule (cf. eq. [\eqref=sumrule] below). In this domain the quasi-localization of the particles at high coupling values in classical systems is well established [\cite=Donko2002]. This behavior should be shared by the strongly coupled electron liquid: thus the Quasilocalized Charge Approximation [\cite=Kalman1990] [\cite=*Golden2000] (originally developed for classical systems) should provide the appropriate treatment for the description of the collective excitations. The QLCA is based on the premise that in the strong coupling Coulomb liquid phase, particles are trapped in local potential minima and that the oscillations of those momentarily caged particles govern the formation of the collective modes. It has been successfully applied in many situations and may be considered as a well-tested approximation scheme (see e.g. [\cite=Kalman2007] [\cite=*Donko2008] [\cite=*Golden2010] [\cite=*Rosenberg2016]). Based on simulation data, one can estimate that the QLCA is valid down to the 1/20th of the Wigner cristallization rs value.

We proceed to calculate the long-wavelength plasmon dispersion in the zero-temperature homogeneous electron liquid consisting of N (with total density n) electrons immersed in a neutralizing uniform background of a smeared-out positive charge. We view the system as a binary Coulomb mixture of [formula] spin-up electrons and [formula] spin-down electrons; [formula]. The physics of strongly coupled charged binary systems has been investigated by analytical [\cite=Kalman1990] [\cite=*Golden2000] and molecular dynamics [\cite=Kalman2014] [\cite=Silvestri2015] studies. Recent work on the collective mode structure of a strongly coupled binary ionic mixture (BIM) - a binary system of likely charged particles in a neutralizing background [\cite=Kalman1990] [\cite=*Golden2000] [\cite=Kalman2014],- has revealed the existence of a second low frequency plasmon mantained by the out-of-phase oscillations of the two components. This suggests that if we consider the electron liquid as a binary mixture of charged particles with up and down spins, an excitation similar to the BIM second plasmon would be generated.

Invoking now the QLCA approach, the dispersion of the modes is to be obtained from the QLCA dynamical matrix for a general two component system [\cite=Kalman1990] [\cite=*Golden2000]

[formula]

[formula]

The indices A,B,C now designate the spin species; hAB(r) is the pair correlation function between particles in species A and B (note that the two-particle function gAB(r)  =  1  +  hAB(r)) and

[formula]

are nominal plasma and Einstein frequencies, respectively, and ZA the charge number of species A.

Here we are interested in the longitudinal modes only. In particular, we focus on their behavior at long wavelengths where the salient features of the mode structures come into focus. Accordingly, for a system of equal masses and charges, the longitudinal projection of eq. [\eqref=QLCAC] gives the longitudinal dynamical matrix elements as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where ω20  =  4πe2n / m is the total plasma frequency, cA  =  nA / n and [formula] is proportional to the exchange-correlation potential energy density. The crucial feature of the expressions above is the appearance of the hAB(0) terms, i.e. the value of the pair correlation function at r = 0. This, in turn, is the consequence of the singular [formula] term in the dipole-dipole interaction potential, eq. [\eqref=psimn]. This term, which has the trivial value [formula] in a classical BIM, plays an important role in atomic systems, where the wave function and the two-particle function g(r) have a non-vanishing value at r = 0 [\cite=Bethe1977]. Here it is the crucial element that drives the out-of-phase oscillation of the system.

The oscillation frequencies are the solutions of the dispersion relation

[formula]

The long-wavelength oscillation frequencies are

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Expression [\eqref=omegaplus] represents the well known plasmon excitation. The new feature is the emergence of the second plasmon excitation ω2-, wholly maintained, as stated, by the anti-parallel spin pair correlation function, [formula], evaluated at r  =  0. This is the main result of the present work.

The plasmon frequencies at k = 0 have no explicit dependence on the degree of polarization of the electron liquid (although there is an implicit dependence through [formula] [\cite=Ortiz1994] [\cite=*Ortiz1997] [\cite=Spink2013]); however, the coefficients in the k-dependent dispersion do. The k-dependence, to lowest order in k, can be determined through the IAB integrals, which require the input of all the three spin-resolved correlation functions. Such spin-resolved pair correlation function data were recently generated from diffusion Monte Carlo simulations and are available for the unpolarized electron liquid up to rs  =  20 (see Fig. 2 of Ref.[\cite=Spink2013]). They are also provided by Ref. [\cite=Gori-Giorgi2000] [\cite=*Gori-Giorgi2002] for values ranging from 0 to 10. These data appear to share one common feature: [formula], whence [formula]. Thus, the dispersions of the second plasmon eqs. [\eqref=omegaminus][\eqref=vdisp] appear to be negative. This is, however, true only to the extent that the positive BG contribution is negligible. This latter is not available from the QLCA approach, but can be estimated from a two-component third moment sum rule, generalized from Ref. [\cite=Golden2013] [\cite=*Margulis1987]

[formula]

the second term on RHS of eq. [\eqref=sumrule] is the kinetic energy of species A per particle averaged over the interacting system and χAB is the density response function. It is interesting to note that BG contributions are similar for the two modes; the correlational contributions are, of course, different. A typical value for [formula] is very close to - 1 in the strong coupling regime. This positions ω- typically at about 57% of the plasma frequency. It may be observed that the lowest value of ω-, seems to occur in the weak coupling limit when [formula] as rs  →  0. This is, however, misleading, since in this limit the electrons are unlocalized and rather than the QLCA it is the RPA approach, whose results concerning plasmon dispersion are well-known, that is applicable. The opposite limit, where [formula], i.e. [formula] is similar to the classical binary system (BIM), (see more discussion below).

We now proceed to compare the spectral weights of the two plasmon excitations. To do this one needs the collective contribution to the partial dynamic structure functions, [formula], which are determined by the imaginary part of the QLCA density-density response function, [formula]. This latter is due to the dissipative processes in the system. Since Landau damping should be negligible at strong coupling values an understanding of the leading physical process causing damping of the oscillations is required. Focusing on collisional damping one observes that at k = 0 the intraspecies damping vanishes, due to momentum conservation. The main contribution to the damping in this domain is due to interspecies collisions, whose effect may be described in terms of drag force proportional to

[formula]

where [formula] are the local hydrodynamic velocities of the spin-up, spin-down components and γ is the drag coefficient. For details of the formalism, referred to as the extended QLCA, see [\cite=Silvestri2015]. The soundness of this approach has been corroborated by a series of computer simulations, which have provided excellent agreement with calculations based on the model.

We now introduce

[formula]

where CAB(k) is given in eq. [\eqref=QLCAC] and R represents the damping contribution

[formula]

where ν  =  γn / m is a nominal collisional frequency. By replacing CAB in eq. [\eqref=chareqn] with GAB, one obtains the eigen-frequencies, (Ω-,Ω+) modified by the dissipation to lowest order in ν

[formula]

We observe that the normal plasmon, Ω+, where the two spin components oscillate in-phase is unaffected (it is still slightly damped by Landau damping, which is not covered by the QLCA model). The elements of [formula] can now be calculated from

[formula]

The Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem for the partial dynamic structure functions of the spin-up/spin-down density fluctuation at T  =  0 provides the collective contribution to SAB(k,ω),

[formula]

Then, a rather lengthy algebra yields, to lowest order in ν and k, a Lorentzian distribution over ω2, centered around ω2-

[formula]

In view of eq. [\eqref=RAB],

[formula]

in keeping with the out-of-phase character of the oscillations. Consequently, the dynamic structure function of the total density fluctuation vanishes

[formula]

This is expected, since the total density remains unaffected by the out-of-phase oscillations of the spin densities. In contrast, all spin-resolved density fluctuations exhibit a well-defined peak at ω-

[formula]

Even though in the absence of more physical information it is difficult to estimate what the actual strength of this peak would be, the important point is that the strength has a finite value, accessible to observation. It should also be noted that δSAB(k,ω) has its maximum in the unpolarized state and vanishes in the fully polarized ferromagnetic phase.

What kind of physical observation, then, would be sensitive to the existence of the second plasmon? In the absence of density fluctuations one has to access the information contained in the partial response functions. For this a spin-sensitive scattering experiment would be required. In this scenario first the physical alignment of the spins has to be accomplished: this can be done by the application of a weak magnetic field. Second, a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave (X-ray) [\cite=Platzman1970], or spin-polarized neutron beam scattering experiment can be contemplated. Polarized neutrons have already been successfully employed to map magnetic structures in electron liquids [\cite=Qureshi2014] [\cite=*Wasser2016], exploiting that they scatter differently on the spin-up an spin-down density fluctuations. In the present work, these spin-resolved density fluctuations show a peak at ω- and therefore such a measurement should reveal the possible existence of the second plasmon excitation.

In summary, we have shown the existence of a second plasmon (ω-) in a strongly coupled electron liquid. The second plasmon is maintained by the out-of-phase oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down components of the electron liquid, but governed solely by the Coulomb interaction between the particles. ω- is proportional to the overlap (r = 0) (absolute) value of the of the spin-up/spin-down correlation function, [formula]. This latter is an increasing function of the coupling parameter, rs. The spectral weight of the mode has a typical Lorentzian structure, with a peak value which, again, depends on [formula]. However, since the total density is not influenced by the relative motions of the two components, the spectral weight is exhibited in the partial spin-spin dynamical structure functions only, leaving the total density structure function unaffected.

The physical ingredients that contribute to the formation of this collective excitation are

We have estimated the range of rs values within which the second plasmon manifests itself as rs  =  10 - 60. Within this range the electron liquid may become polarized: this, however, has no bearing on the k = 0 frequency of the second plasmon although it affects its spectral weight. We estimate the typical value of ω- to be about 57% of the normal plasmon frequency. The k-dependent dispersion of ω-(k), similarly to the normal plasmon dispersion, is the combination of a positive Bohm-Gross contribution governed by the kinetic energy (with a value that can be determined by invoking a two component third moment sum rule) and a negative contribution, governed by the spin-spin exchange-correlation energies. In a polarized state, both of these factors are affected by the degree of polarization. We have proposed polarized X-ray and polarized neutron beam scattering experiments that may provide observational evidence of the existence of the second plasmon. More work is needed to reveal what influence the existence of this additional collective excitation in the electron liquid would have on the behavior of the system.
