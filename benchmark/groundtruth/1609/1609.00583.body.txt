A priori error estimates of the DtN-FEM: fluid-solid interaction problems

Introduction

In this work, we consider numerical solutions of the time-harmonic fluid-solid interaction (FSI) problem, the scattering of a time-harmonic acoustic incident wave by an elastic body immersed in a fluid. This problem plays an important role in many fields of application, including exploration seismology, oceanography, and non-destructive testing, and to name a few. We consider the linear, isotropic and bounded elastic body whose displacement field is modeled by the time-harmonic Navier equation. The medium outside the elastic body is filled with a homogeneous compressible inviscid fluid and the acoustic scattered field is described by the Helmholtz equation together with the Sommerfeld's radiation condition at infinity.

It has been studied extensively in the past several decades to develop efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of time-harmonic FSI problems. One of the popular methods is the boundary integral equation (BIE) method ([\cite=LM95] [\cite=YHX]) which leads us to solving a system of boundary integral equations defined on the transmission boundary. In addition to the well-known advantages associated with BIE methods, there also exist some restrictions, such as eigenvalue issues and hyper-singularity features associated with boundary integral operators, which need to be extraordinarily considered for this method. The second method is the coupling methods, for instance, using the boundary element method (BEM) to solve the acoustic problem while the finite element methods (FEM) is employed to approximate the interior elastic wave leads to a coupled FEM-BEM method ([\cite=BM91] [\cite=DSM121] [\cite=DSM122] [\cite=HKR00] [\cite=MMS04] [\cite=YRX]). Advantages of this method include the feasibility of dealing with elastic mediums with variable coefficients, comparatively less requirement on the shape of artificial boundary and the fact of naturally and exactly taking into account the Sommerfeld's radiation condition, and to name a few. The third way is to introduce an artificial boundary or an absorbing layer so that one can reduce the original unbounded problem to a nonlocal boundary value problem which could be solved using field equation solvers such as the FEM. In this case, proper absorbing or non-reflected boundary conditions are required to be defined on the artificial boundaries or layers. There are mainly two strategies for the definition of such artificial boundary conditions applied to the exterior time-harmonic acoustic scattering. One is called the perfectly matched layer ([\cite=B94] [\cite=BP13] [\cite=CL06]), and the other is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) mapping based on Fourier series expansions ([\cite=F83] [\cite=F84] [\cite=KG89]). Coupling of the DtN mapping and the FEM leads to the so-called DtN-FEM ([\cite=G99]) which is the method we use in this work to solve the FSI problem.

There exsiting some issues for the DtN-FEM solving the scattering problem. The first one is the limitation on the shape of the artificial boundary, and it has been considered in earlier works ([\cite=NN04] [\cite=NN06]) where the authors apply perturbation methods to the DtN mapping so that it can be defined on a perturbed curve of the artificial boundary with regular shape such as a circle or an ellipse. The second issue is the potential loss of uniqueness for the solution of modified nonlocal boundary value problem due to the truncation of infinite series of DtN mapping. In [\cite=GK95], the authors defined a modified form of the DtN mapping to circumvent this difficulty. This modified form of DtN mapping is equivalent to the original DtN mapping, and however is not equivalent to the one after truncation ([\cite=HW13]). From the numerical point of view, authors of [\cite=HH92] suggested to make a choice of N  ≥  kR, where N is the truncation order of infinite series, k is the wave number and R is the radius of circular artificial boundary. The third problem is related to the error estimate due to truncation of the DtN mapping, and the errors are indeed understood ([\cite=NN06]) to have an order of exponential decay. For problems of Laplace and linear elasto-statics, authors of [\cite=HW85] [\cite=HW92] have derived an priori error estimates indicating such effects based on the fact that the corresponding sesquilinear form is positive definite. However, it is nontrivial to apply the technique in [\cite=HW85] [\cite=HW92] to the acoustic and elastic scattering problems since the corresponding sesquilinear form is usually indefinite. In this work, we take the FSI problem as the model problem to investigate the last two issues mentioned above for the DtN-FEM. Without doing modification, we will give a novel and strait-forward procedure to prove the unique solvability (Section 4.2) of the truncated variational equation for FSI problem instead of a proof of contradiction in ([\cite=HNPX11]) where the exterior acoustic scattering problem was considered. In order to investigate the errors due to the truncation of the infinite series DtN mapping, we derive a new and more apparent truncation error estimates declaring exponential attenuation between the exact DtN mapping and its truncated one (Theorem 4.2). Based on these two results, we are allowed to derive a priori error estimates (Theorem 5.3 and 5.4) involving the effects of both finite element discretization and infinite series truncation, and in particular, explicitly indicating the order of exponential decay due to the truncation of DtN mapping.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first describe the classical FSI problem in Section 2, and then reduce the transmission problem to an equivalent nonlocal boundary value problem in Section 3. Essential mathematical analysis for the corresponding variational equation of the nonlocal boundary value problem and its modification due to truncation of the DtN mapping are discussed in Section 3 and 4, respectively. In Section 5, we establish a priori error estimates including both effects of numerical discretization and for the finite element solution of the modified variational equation. Several numerical experiments are presented to confirm our theoretical results in Section 6 and finally we make a conclusion in Section 7.

Statement of the problem

Let [formula] denote a bounded and simply connected domain with sufficiently smooth interface Γ  =  ∂Ω, and [formula] be the unbounded exterior region. The domain Ω is occupied by a linear and isotropic elastic solid determined through the Lamé constants λ and μ (μ>0, λ  +  μ > 0) and its mass density ρ > 0, and Ωc is filled with compressible, inviscid fluids. We denote by c0 > 0 the speed of sound in the fluid, ρf > 0 the density of the fluid, ω the frequency and k = ω / c0 the wave number. The fluid-solid interaction problem to be considered in this work is to determine the elastic displacement [formula] in the solid and the acoustic scattered field p in the fluid provided an incident field pinc. It can be described mathematically as follows. Given pinc, find [formula] and [formula] satisfying

[formula]

and the Sommerfeld radiation condition

[formula]

uniformly with respect to all [formula]. Here, [formula] is the normal derivative on Γ (here and in the sequel, [formula] is always the outward unit normal to the boundary), [formula] is the imaginary unit. Δ* is the operator defined by

[formula]

and the standard stress operator [formula] is defined by

[formula]

It is known ([\cite=JDS83]) that the problem ([\ref=Navier1])-([\ref=RadiationCond]) is not always uniquely solvable due to the occurrence of traction free oscillations for certain geometries and some frequencies ω. These ω are also known as the Jones frequencies which are inherent to the original model. We conclude from [\cite=LM95] the following uniqueness result.

If the surface Γ and the material parameters (μ,λ,ρ) are such that there are no traction free solutions, the boundary value problem ([\ref=Navier1])-([\ref=RadiationCond]) has at most one solution. Here, we call a nontrivial [formula] a traction free solution if it solves

[formula]

To simplify the presentation throughout the dissertation, we shall denote by c > 0, α > 0 and [formula] generic constants whose precise values are not required and may change line by line.

Nonlocal boundary value problem

DtN mapping

We introduce an artificial circular boundary [formula] such that [formula]. The artificial boundary decomposes the exterior domain Ωc into two subdomains. One is the annular region [formula] between Γ and ΓR, and the other is the unbounded exterior region [formula]. On ΓR, we impose the exact transparent boundary condition

[formula]

where S is known as the DtN mapping from Hs(ΓR) to Hs - 1(ΓR) defined by

[formula]

or equivalently,

[formula]

Here and in the sequel, the prime behind the summation means that the first term in the summation is multiplied by 1 / 2. The transparent boundary condition ([\ref=DtNBoundaryCond]) defines a nonlocal condition for p on ΓR since the Dirichlet data p over the entire boundary ΓR are required to compute the Neumann date [formula] at a single point x∈ΓR. We have the following mapping property for S (see Theorem 3.1 in [\cite=HNPX11]).

For any constant s  ≥  1 / 2, the DtN mapping S defined by ([\ref=DtNmap]) or ([\ref=DtNmap1]) is a bounded linear operator from Hs(ΓR) to Hs - 1(ΓR), that is, there exists a constant c > 0 independent of φ∈Hs(ΓR) such that

[formula]

Reduced problem

Now, the transmission problem ([\ref=Navier1])-([\ref=RadiationCond]) can be equivalently replaced by the following nonlocal boundary value problem: Given pinc, find [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

The uniqueness result for the nonlocal boundary value problem ([\ref=Navier2])-([\ref=DtNCond]) is established in the next Theorem.

If the surface Γ and the material parameter (μ,λ,ρ) are such that there are no traction free solutions, the nonlocal boundary value problem ([\ref=Navier2])-([\ref=DtNCond]) has at most one solution.

It is sufficient to prove that the corresponding homogeneous boundary value problem of ([\ref=Navier2])-([\ref=DtNCond]) has only the trivial solution. Suppose that [formula] is the solution of the corresponding homogeneous value problem of ([\ref=Navier2])-([\ref=DtNCond]). Now let p1 be the solution of the following exterior Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation

[formula]

Then p1 has the explicit representation form

[formula]

where c > 0 is a constant independent of h and N.

From the BBL condition ([\ref=BBLcondition]), we know that

[formula]

by replacing [formula] with [formula]. According to ([\ref=Weak1]) and ([\ref=Weak3]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. Therefore, substracting ([\ref=5-2-2]) from ([\ref=5-2-3]) leads to

[formula]

Thus, by ([\ref=5-2-4]), the inequality ([\ref=5-2-1]) implies that

[formula]

where c is a positive constant. Consequently, the triangular inequality and the formulation ([\ref=5-2-5]) yield, [formula]

[formula]

and this further leads to

[formula]

where c > 0 is a constant independent of h and N. This completes the proof.

From the estimate ([\ref=uppererror]), we can see that the numerical errors is constructed by two single terms. We study the first term correlated with the finite element meshsize h by using the approximation theory, and the second term dependent on the truncation order N by employing the point estimate ([\ref=EstDiffSSN1]). Let [formula]. In the following, starting with the estimate ([\ref=uppererror]), we derive a priori error estimates measured in H1-norm and H0-norm respectively to conclude this section.

Suppose that [formula] for [formula]. Then there exist constants h0 > 0 and N0  ≥  0 such that for any h∈(0,h0] and N  ≥  N0

[formula]

where c > 0 and 0 < q < 1 are constants independent of h and N.

We have known from Theorem [\ref=Theorem5.2] that

[formula]

where c > 0 is a positive constant. The approximation property of the finite element space Hh gives

[formula]

where c > 0 is a positive constant independent of h. We now consider the second term in ([\ref=5-3-1]). The trace theorem implies that there exists a bounded linear operator γ:H1(ΩR)  →  H1 / 2(ΓR) such that

[formula]

where 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉ΓR is the standard L2 duality pairing between H- 1 / 2(ΓR) and H1 / 2(ΓR), and γ*:H- 1 / 2(ΓR)  →  (H1(ΩR))' is the adjoint operator of γ. Therefore, we have

[formula]

because of Theorem [\ref=Theorem4.2] and the boundedness of operators γ and γ*. The proof is hence established by following a combination of ([\ref=5-3-2]) and ([\ref=5-3-4]).

We now extend the error estimate in the energy space to the one measured in the [formula] space.

Suppose that [formula] for [formula]. Then there exist constants h0 > 0 and N0  ≥  0 such that for any h∈(0,h0] and N  ≥  N0

[formula]

where c > 0 and 0 < q < 1 are constants independent of h and N.

Let [formula] be the finite element error. Then by ([\ref=5-2-4]) in Theorem 5.2, we have

[formula]

Now, we consider the following boundary value problem: Find [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Let [formula] be a weak solution of nonlocal boundary value problem ([\ref=duality1])-([\ref=duality5]), hence [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Replacing [formula] by [formula] in ([\ref=5-4-2]) gives

[formula]

Then subtracting ([\ref=5-4-3]) from ([\ref=5-4-1]) leads to, for [formula]

[formula]

Theorem 4.4, the approximation property of Hh and the regularity theory imply that

[formula]

where c > 0 is a constant. Following the same argument in Theorem 5.3 and choosing t  =  2, we arrive at, by the regularity theory,

[formula]

Similarly, we also have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, by the triangular inequality we know

[formula]

Therefore, by the combination of the inequalities ([\ref=5-4-5])-([\ref=5-4-7]) and ([\ref=energyest]) we have

[formula]

Finally, according to the fact that h∈(0,h0] and N  ≥  N0, we arrive at ([\ref=L2est]).

Numerical experiments

In this section, we present several numerical tests to validate our theoretical results, and, unless otherwise stated, we always take the parameters ω = 1, μ = 1, λ = 1, ρ = 1, ρf = 1 and R0 = 1. We first introduce a model problem whose analytical solution is available so that we are able to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical solution. We consider the scattering of a plane incident wave pinc = eikx  ·  d with direction d = (1,0) by a disc-shaped elastic body of radius R0 (see Figure [\ref=fig2]). For the exact solution of this model problem, please see the Appendix. In numerical computations, the computational domain Ω and ΩR are discretized by uniform triangle elements and we employ piecewise linear basis functions {φi}i = N1i = 1 and {ψi}i = N2i = 1 in Ω and ΩR, respectively, to construct the finite element space Hh. Here, N1 and N2 are the total number of elements in Ω and ΩR, respectively. To find the finite element solution of ([\ref=Weak3]), one needs to compute the integrals

[formula]

for those ψi and ψj not vanishing on ΓR. For the sake of simplicity, ([\ref=numbn1]) can be approximated by

[formula]

where {ζi} are the corresponding piecewise linear basis functions in terms of θ on ΓR. Thus, the computation of integrals ([\ref=numbn1]) amounts to evaluating a series as

[formula]

or

[formula]

In the numerical experiments, we firstly check the accuracy of the DtN-FEM. We choose R = 2, N = 20 and consider three different wave numbers k = 1, 2 and 4. Figure 3 shows the exact and numerical solutions of the elastic displacement [formula] in the solid and the acoustic scattered field p in the fluid for the problem ([\ref=Navier1])-([\ref=RadiationCond]) with k = 1 and meshsize h = 0.1076. We can observe that the numerical solutions are in a perfect agreement with the exact series solutions from the qualitative point of view. According to Theorems 5.3 and 5.4, as the truncation order N of the DtN mapping is large enough that the domain discretization error is dominant, we should be able to observe that

[formula]

for the finite element space Hh. In Figure 4, we show the log-log plot of errors [formula] measured in H0 and H1-norms with respect to 1 / h which verifies the convergence order of O(h2) and O(h). Finally, we are concerned with the effects of truncation order N on the total numerical errors. We choose k = 1 and compute the numerical errors measured in H0-norm for three different meshsizes h = 0.4304, 0.2151 and 0.1076, respectively. The log-log plots of errors are presented in Figure 5 showing that the errors due to the truncation of the DtN mapping decay extremely fast, arriving at the low bound correlating to each finite element mesh size.

Conclusion

In this paper, we consider the DtN-FEM solving the two dimensional FSI problem in which the DtN mapping is defined by a Fourier series on a circle. Uniqueness and existence of solutions for the corresponding variational problem are established. We also consider a truncated variational problem due to the truncation of DtN mapping and its solvability results are given by using a novel proof technique. A priori error estimates involving the effects of both finite element meshsize and the truncation order of series for the proposed DtN-FEM are derived. The investigation strategy in this article will be extended to other scattering problems in the future.

Appendix

Here, we derive the exact solution for the considered model problem in Section 6. We can represent the solution of ([\ref=Navier1])-([\ref=RadiationCond]) as

[formula]

with

[formula]

where the coefficients An, Bn and Cn are to be determined. According to the transmission condition ([\ref=TransCond1.1])-([\ref=TransCond2.1]), we are able to obtain a linear system of equations as

[formula]

where Xn = (An,Cn,Dn)T. For the system matrix En and vector en, the elements (identified by the super-script) are computed as follows:
