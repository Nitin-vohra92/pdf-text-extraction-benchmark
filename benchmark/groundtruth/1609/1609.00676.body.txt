A Search for the LHCb Charmed 'Pentaquark' using Photo-Production of J / ψ at Threshold in Hall C at Jefferson Lab

Introduction and motivation

Photo-production of J / ψ on a nucleon very close to threshold is an important subject in the field of non-perturbative QCD in its own right [\cite=Brodsky:2015zxu] and is already planned to be investigated at Jefferson Lab as the 12 GeV upgrade of CEBAF is completed [\cite=CLAS12-tcs:proposal] [\cite=SoLIDjpsi:proposal]. Oddly enough the potential of discovery of hidden charm baryon resonances via photo-production was discussed in 2014 [\cite=Huang:2013mua] inspired in part by the SoLID-J / ψ approved proposal at Jefferson Lab [\cite=SoLIDjpsi:proposal]. However, CERN's recent experimental discovery [\cite=cernpr:2016] has spurred a new excitement and a sense of urgency to carry out measurements of photo-production at threshold in a timely manner.

Less than a year ago, on July 14, 2015, a press release from the CERN press office announced the observation of exotic pentaquark particles [\cite=cernpr:2016] just a day after the manuscript describing the discovery was posted on the arXiv.org [\cite=Sheldon:2016] website by the collaboration. A month later, on August 12, 2015 the announcement was followed by the publication of the manuscript describing the discovery in Physical Review Letters [\cite=Aaij:2015tga]. This announcement was received with both excitement and a healthy dose of skepticism due to the early saga of 'pentaquarks,' in the beginning of the new millennium, which proved inconclusive. Unlike these earlier announced pentaquarks, which consisted of four light quarks and one strange quark, the resonant state observed by the LHCb includes two heavy quarks, namely charm and anti-charm quarks and thus must be different in nature.

Subsequent to the announcement a series of theoretical papers [\cite=Liu:2016fe] [\cite=Karliner:2015ina] [\cite=Chen:2015loa] [\cite=Eides:2015dtr] [\cite=Wang:2015jsa] [\cite=Karliner:2015voa] [\cite=Kubarovsky:2015aaa] [\cite=Guo:2015umn] appeared in the literature with possible interpretations of the observed resonance. A range of explanations was invoked, from a possible true pentaquark resonant state to a kinematic enhancement like those observed in other experiments close to kinematic thresholds [\cite=Bai:2003sw], such as a bound state of charmonium(2S) and the proton [\cite=Eides:2015dtr], or a molecule composed of Σc and *  ~  [\cite=Lu:2016nnt] [\cite=Huang:2016tcr]. But without further experimental measurements it is not clear whether the formed exotic resonance can be unambiguously identified as a resonance. Some authors suggested that effects of final state interactions are responsible for the LHCb observed rate enhancements [\cite=Guo:2015umn]. While the interest of the theory community has produced more than 200 citations up to date, LHCb is the only experiment that has observed these states. The hadronic physics community is eager to see these possible resonant states confirmed in more than one experiment and proceed with a detailed investigation of the quantum numbers of such states.

In summary, to resolve the true nature of the P+c(4380) and P+c(4450) states it is proposed to study these pentaquark candidates in direct photo-production of J / ψ on the proton and provide not only further evidence of their existence but also investigate their spin and parity, as noted in several papers, such as [\cite=Wang:2015jsa] [\cite=Karliner:2015voa] [\cite=Kubarovsky:2015aaa] [\cite=Blin:2016dlf]. This proposal is more specifically about a direct search of the higher mass narrow width P+c(4450) and follows Wang et al. [\cite=Wang:2015jsa] using the different spins and parity described in the paper but with the less optimistic assumptions about the coupling to the resonant states during our complete simulations, namely a 5% coupling.

We believe that the results from this search at Jefferson Lab will have a high impact on the broader physics community.

Present data status

The photo-production of J / ψ has been measured in many experiments at high invariant mass of the photon-proton system (Wγ - p at HERA [\cite=Chekanov:2002xi] [\cite=Alexa:2013xxa], and more recently at LHCb [\cite=Aaij:2013jxj] (see right Fig. [\ref=fig:xsection]). The total elastic J / ψ production at high photon-nucleon invariant mass Wγp is well described by the t-channel exchange of a colorless object between the photon and the proton [\cite=frankfurt:2002], in this case two-gluon exchange. The differential cross section in the proton momentum transfer variable t is usually described by [formula] with a value of b that depends on Wγp. As Wγp decreases towards the threshold region of J / ψ production, the mechanism is described by a Pomeron exchange or two-gluon exchange [\cite=Brodsky:2000zc] or perhaps a more complicated multi-gluon exchange carrying the non-perturbative information of the gluonic fields in the nucleon. The new LHCb resonance happens to be in this threshold region of invariant mass, a region that has been poorly explored in modern times. It is worth pointing out that the few measurements of this region occurred in the 1970s at Cornell and SLAC and in the 80s at Fermilab ( see left Fig. [\ref=fig:xsection]). In those experiments, issues of unambiguously defining the elastic process of J / ψ production were hampered in some cases by the use of nuclear targets, detector resolution and the detection of one lepton only in the case of the J / ψ pair decay.

In Hall C at Jefferson Lab, a photo-production experiment (E03-008) was performed in the subthreshold regime, but unfortunately no signal was observed after one week of beam scattering off a 12C target [\cite=Bosted:2008mn]. The experiment used a bremsstrahlung beam produced in a copper radiator by the 6 GeV incident electron beam at CEBAF. The pair of spectrometers (HMS and SOS) of Hall C were used to detect the pair of leptons resulting from the decay of the J / ψ. This experiment allowed an upper limit to be set on the cross section which was found to be consistent with the quasi-free production. More recently a proposal [\cite=Chudakov:2007] for the 12 GeV upgrade of Hall C was considered by the PAC and conditionally approved. The authors proposed again the use of bremsstrahlung photon beam created in a radiator to look at the photo-production at threshold in a series of nuclei. The physics goal was to measure the photo-production cross section in order to investigate the A-dependence of the propagation of the J / ψ in the nuclear medium as well as extract the J / ψ - N interaction. In the latter proposal, the J / ψ decay pair was to be detected by the HMS and SHMS similar to what is proposed here, however the optimization of the spectrometer settings was related to enhancing the rate of pairs detected from J / ψ decays in primarily diffractive J / ψ production off nuclei, no resonant production was considered.

In summary, the near threshold region of elastic J / ψ production has yet to be fully explored in the context of understanding the non-perturbative gluonic J / ψ-nucleon interaction. At Jefferson Lab there are approved proposals to measure this region using the CLAS12 detector in Hall B [\cite=CLAS12-tcs:proposal] and the SoLID detector in Hall A [\cite=SoLIDjpsi:proposal]. In this proposal our focus is to confirm the observation of LHCb through a resonant production of the Pc(4450) in the s- and u-channel.

The proposed measurement in Hall C at Jefferson Lab

We propose to measure the elastic J / ψ photo-production cross section as a function of t and photon energy Eγ in the near threshold region in Hall C. A bremsstrahlung photon beam will be created using a 9% copper radiator in front of a liquid hydrogen target, similar to the E-05-101 experiment [\cite=Fanelli:2015eoa]. The optimal placement of the radiator will be chosen to account for the closer proximity of the flow diverters to the beam.

Both high momentum spectrometers of Hall C along with their associated detectors will be used to detect the di-lepton pair decay, namely e+e-. The photon beam mixed with the primary electron beam will strike a 15 cm liquid hydrogen target. The electron-positron decay pair will be detected in coincidence between the high momentum spectrometer (HMS) set for electron detection and the super-high momentum spectrometer (SHMS) set for positron detection. Both spectrometer arms will be used in their standard configuration.

The proposed measurement is designed to search for the highest mass narrow exotic resonant state discovered at LHCb, namely the Pc(4450). The spectrometer settings (shown in Tab. [\ref=table:kin]) are optimized to be most sensitive to the possible resonant production of Pc(4450) in the s- and u-channel. The two spectrometers will detect the J / ψ decay into e+e- from either the diffractive channel or resonant Pc channel production. However, we will take advantage of the different t-dependence of the two processes to optimize the spectrometers' angle and momentum settings to enhance the Pc(4450) signal relative to that of the t-channel production.

The experiment in Hall C

The layout of the proposed experiment is shown in Fig. [\ref=exp:layout] where the HMS is set at an angle of 34[formula] to detect the electrons of the e+e- decay pairs while the SHMS is set at angle of 13[formula] to detect the corresponding positrons. This configuration has been optimized to reduce the accidental coincidences between the two spectrometers as well as minimize the absolute background in each spectrometer. Part of the momentum acceptance of the spectrometer will allow for the detection of the Bethe-Heitler process in a kinematic region forbidden to the diffractive or resonant production of J / ψ. The HMS is chosen to detect electrons, because the inclusive inelastic electron scattering cross section drops rapidly with increasing scattering angle. On the other hand the SHMS would have a very large rate of inclusive electron scattering if it were to be used to detect electrons at the small angle setting of 13[formula]. It is thus run in positive polarity to detect positrons, but it will also accept positive pions and protons.

Each spectrometer has a similar set of standard detectors to identify electrons/positrons and reject charged pions and protons. In each case the momentum of the particles is provided through tracking by a set of drift chambers, and electron identification is ensured by a light gas Cerenkov counter and an electromagnetic calorimeter. The trigger in each spectrometer is defined by a coincidence between a set of 2 hodoscope scintillator planes along the path of the particles. These configurations offer an electron or positron detection efficiency greater than 98% and a pion rejection factor of about a thousand. The timing resolution online will be defined by the time coincidence between the hodoscopes in each spectrometer first and then a time coincidence between both spectrometers. We expect it to be on the range of few nanoseconds, however improvements will be possible when the tracking information is corrected for offline. A gate of about 50 ns will be used between the two spectrometers.

We point out that a lower electron beam energy of 10.7 GeV, rather than 11.0 GeV, with the same spectrometer settings, will result in a more suppressed t-channel production, while it should not affect the s and u channel Pc(4450) production.

Kinematics

The kinematics were optimized using a full simulation of the experiment and focused on enhancing the resonant production of J / ψ through the Pc(4450) relative to the diffractive production. This is done by taking advantage of the t-dependence of the diffractive production since the latter is suppressed at large values of t while the resonant production in the s-channel of Pc is rather flat across the same t range. The spectrometer settings are chosen to take advantage of this difference in t-dependence. In Tab. [\ref=table:kin] we list the spectrometers' momentum and angle settings converged upon and the resulting acceptance for a coincident detection of the di-lepton pair. Also shown is the additional spectrometer setting needed for a precise determination of the t-channel background left of the peak.

Shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:kin-t] left and right are the distributions of angle versus momentum of the decay pair of leptons, the full correlated phase space of the t-channel production of the pair is shown on the left figure while the similar phase space of the resonant Pc production is shown on the right.

It is important to take into account the different possibilities of spin of the exotic charmed resonance. In all cases we found that it is best to keep kinematics that correspond to cos θ between - 0.4 and 0.2 as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:kin-theta], or, in other words, close to the 90[formula] range in the center of mass frame. This maximizes the Pc production rate, relative to the t-channel production rate.

Physics and accidental backgrounds

The typical process of elastic J / ψ production is usually described by a Feynman diagram represented in Fig. [\ref=fig:t-chan-diag] and is well understood at high energies using perturbation theory [\cite=Donnachie:2002en]. This process at threshold is usually described by a two-gluon exchange [\cite=Brodsky:2000zc] [\cite=frankfurt:2002] although at threshold the gluons could be an effective representation of an interaction that conserves color but is much more complicated. A full experimental physics program to explore the threshold region of J / ψ production completely is planned by gathering large amount of data through electro-production and photo-production using the CLAS12  [\cite=CLAS12-tcs:proposal] and SoLID [\cite=SoLIDjpsi:proposal] detectors in the coming years.

Production of e+e- through elastic J / ψ production and decay

In the proposed experiment we are not concerned with the elastic t-channel production of J / ψ, which we consider to be a physics background, but are rather interested in confirming the possible resonance production of the J / ψ through the decay of the newly discovered states at LHCb, namely Pc(4450) and Pc(4380). This production is typically described by an s- and u-channel production of these resonances according to the diagrams of Fig. [\ref=fig:s-u-chan-diag]. More specifically it is a search for Pc(4450) that we are focused on in this proposal. Pc(4380) is broader with a lower cross section, and thus requires a more challenging setup to be determined cleanly.

Therefore, in this experiment the challenge is to separate the two different processes, one that we consider to be a physics background (t-channel production of J / ψ) and one that is our important signal (s- and u-channel resonant production through Pc). We propose to use spectrometer settings that will dramatically reduce the acceptance of the t-channel production of the relative to the s- and u-channel resonant production of . These setting were optimized using a multidimensional scan of the acceptance for both spectrometers in the full phase space.

Bethe-Heitler pair production

To evaluate the Bethe-Heitler background represented by the processes described in Fig. [\ref=fig:bh-t] we used the calculations of Pauk and Vanderhaeghen [\cite=Pauk:2015oaa] [\cite=Vander:2016] but with Ml+l- evaluated within the acceptance of our spectrometer settings centered around the mass of Pc(4450). We use the dipole electromagnetic form factor for the range of momentum transfers covering the proposed experiment. We find that this background is over 10 times smaller as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:bh-rate], nevertheless it can be calculated and controlled for.

Single e± background

The electron rate in the HMS was estimated using CTEQ5 [\cite=Lai:2000im], and cross checked using the F1F209 program [\cite=Bosted:2012qc]. The positron rate in the SHMS was estimated using the EPC program [\cite=Lightbody:1988ke] combined with a positron background program written for the E94-010 experiment at JLab. The rate can be found in Tab. [\ref=table:singles].

Single π± background

The charged pion singles rate was estimated using the Wiser program [\cite=wiser:1977]. Its results can be found in Tab. [\ref=table:singles].

Accidental coincidence rate

Using the results from Tab. [\ref=table:singles], the accidental coincidence rate for a [formula] trigger window between the HMS and SHMS, was found to be of the order of [formula]. This is two full orders of magnitude lower than the expected signal rate and therefore negligible. For this calculation we assumed a pion rejection larger than 103 from the combined erenkov and calorimeter system.

Background from γp  →  J / ψpπ

The inelastic channel of production, where an additional final state pion is produced but not detected, might contaminate the kinematic region where the is produced. The cross section of these inelastic channels was found to be less than 30% of the elastic t-channel cross section at high energies, and is expected to be even smaller near the threshold [\cite=Binkley:1981kv] [\cite=Chudakov:2007]. In this region, the dominant contribution is the resonant channel [formula], with a threshold at approximately [formula].

In the acceptance of our proposed setting #1, and for a photon endpoint energy of [formula], the photon energy spectrum for this inelastic t-channel process occupies the same reconstructed energy range as the elastic t-channel events. These reconstructed energies corresponds to a true photon energies of [formula] higher, where the cross is approximately four times larger. This fourfold rise in the cross section is almost exactly compensated by the acceptance, which is four times lower for this process, due to a corresponding shift of the reconstructed t of [formula]. Ultimately, this background is expected to increase the elastic t-channel background by at most 30%.

Background from lepto-production

To estimate the background due to lepto-production, we simulated the [formula] process for a [formula] electron beam at [formula]. We found only quasi-real photons, up to a virtuality of [formula] to have a significant impact. Photons with a higher virtuality are highly suppressed because of the following reasons:

the virtual photon flux drops with Q2

Higher Q2 means lower W2 for fixed values of ν, and the t-channel cross section drops for lower W2. Furthermore, close to threshold, the available phase space shrinks rapidly for lower W2.

The highly-tuned spectrometer acceptance drops with Q2.

Because only the quasi-real photons play a role, the contribution due to lepto-production will lead to a (small) enhancement of the count rates. We will verify the impact of this contribution by conducting a dedicated measurement without the radiator.

Simulation of the experiment

We use a custom Monte-Carlo generator to obtain a realistic estimate of the photo-production rates. This generator uses the bremsstrahlung spectrum for a 10% radiator, appropriate models for the t-channel and Pc resonant channel, and the HMS and SHMS spectrometer acceptance with realistic smearing effects. The leptonic [formula] decay is simulated using a (1 + cos2θe) angular distribution in the helicity frame. More details about the simulation can be found below.

Model for the t-channel cross section

In order to calculate the cross section for the t-channel production, we fit the cross section ansatz for two gluon exchange from Brodksy et al. [\cite=Brodsky:2000zc] (equation (3)) to the available world data. The result of this fit (in [formula] is given by,

[formula]

where x is given by a near-threshold definition of the fractional momentum carried by the valence quark, v is a kinematic factor, b the impact parameter and A an overall normalization constant that was determined by a fit to the world data,

[formula]

Additionally, Mp and [formula] are respectively the proton mass and mass in GeV. The curve from Eq. [\ref=eq:tchannel-xsec] is shown as a red line in Figures [\ref=fig:xsection] and [\ref=fig:xsec-comp].

Model for the [formula] cross section

Several equivallent approaches to calculate the [formula] cross section can be found in the literature [\cite=Wang:2015jsa] [\cite=Karliner:2015voa] [\cite=Kubarovsky:2015aaa] [\cite=Blin:2016dlf]. We based our model of the cross section on the work by Wang et al. [\cite=Wang:2015jsa]. Note that this cross section depends quadratically on the coupling to the [formula] channel. We considered the (5/2+) and (5/2-) spin/parity assumptions for the narrow state, with the corresponding (3/2-) and (3/2+) assumption for the state. The angular distribution for the production for each of the spin-parity assumptions can be found in Fig. [\ref=fig:kin-theta]. The contributions of the (5/2+,3/2-) channels to the photo-production cross section as a function of photon energy Eγ are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:xsec-comp].

We optimized the spectrometer settings for a (5/2+) case with 5% coupling to the [formula] channel, as it agrees well with the existing photo-production data. This setting, also has a good sensitivity to a (5/2-) as its production cross section is a full order of magnitude larger. To perform this optimization, a total of 3.4 million possible spectrometer settings were considered. We selected a setting that maximizes the acceptance for produced with a cos θ between - 0.4 and 0.2 in the center-of-mass frame, as shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:kin-theta]. This corresponds to a setting that selects the high-t region, where there is a maximum sensitivity to the (5/2+) resonant production, while simultaneously the sensitivity to the t-channel production is highly suppressed. This setting is listed on the first line of Tab. [\ref=table:kin].

Bremsstrahlung spectrum

The generator uses equation (24) from Tsai [\cite=Tsai:1966js] to evaluate for the bremsstrahlung spectrum. For a 9% radiator combined with 1% from the target (a total of 10% radiator), the photon beam has an integrated intensity of 2.3% of the primary electron beam.

Detector acceptance and resolution

The spectrometer acceptance and realistic smearing are simulated using the parameters listed in Tab. [\ref=table:spec]. An e+e- invariant mass spectrum that was generated using the optimized setting listed on the first line of Tab. [\ref=table:kin] can be found in Figure [\ref=fig:invmass]. The reconstructed mass resolution is [formula].

Projected results

In this section we describe the results of our simulation and the expected results for 9 days of beam on target. We discuss the projected yields in case of 5% coupling for the [formula] channel. Additionally, we will quantify the statistical precision with which we can identify the Pc resonance for different values of the coupling. Finally, we will show the estimated impact of this experiment on the available world data for the photo-production cross section.

Projected results in case of 5% coupling

As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:yieldone] and Fig. [\ref=fig:yieldtwo] the results, clearly reveal the resonant structure of the pentaquark assuming a 5% coupling.

The projected results from the calibration measurement of the t-channel background to the Pc resonant channel, for 2 days of beam on target, can be found in Fig. [\ref=fig:yieldbg]. Note that in addition to providing the necessary leverage for the t-channel background subtraction, this calibration measurement will greatly impact our knowledge of the t-channel photo-production near threshold, where currently no world data exist.

Sensitivity to the Pc resonant production

To obtain an estimate of the sensitivity to the Pc resonant process as a function of the coupling to the [formula] channel, we calculated the log-likelihood difference Δ log L between the hypothesis that the simulated spectra can be described by just a t-channel process, and the hypothesis that the Pc resonances are present on top of the t-channel production. We assumed 9 days of beam at 50  μA for setting #1. We then used Wilk's theorem [\cite=Wilks:1938dza] to relate the value of 2Δ log L to a value of χ2 with 5 degrees of freedom (one for the coupling, and 4 for the mass and width of each of the Pc). Note that a binned likelihood approach was used, which yields a conservative estimate compared to the results of a full unbinned extended maximum likelihood procedure.

The results of this sensitivity study can be found in Fig. [\ref=fig:sensitivity]. We found that, for values of the coupling of 1.3% and higher, we have a sensitivity of more than the 5 standard deviations for discovery. Fig. [\ref=fig:sensitivity] also shows the projected results in case of a 1.3% coupling. For a coupling of 5%, our sensitivity far exceeds 20 standard deviations.

In the proposal, we assumed a realistic coupling of 5% from Wang [\cite=Wang:2015jsa], which they found to be compatible with the currently existing [formula] photo-production data. A more recent statistical analysis by Blin [\cite=Blin:2016dlf] found an upper limit of the coupling values to be between 8 - 17% at the 95% confidence level for the (5/2+). Furthermore, Karliner [\cite=Karliner:2015ina] argues that the coupling cannot be too small, as the [formula] signal is 4.1% of the [formula] final state in [formula]. If the coupling were too small, the value of Λb  →  K-Pc with the Pc decaying to final states other than [formula], would become unreasonably large in comparison with the measured branching fraction of [formula]. This means that, due to the sensitivity of the proposed experiment down to very low values of the coupling, we will have the ability to provide a very strong exclusion of the charmed-pentaquark assumption in case it is not found.

Projected impact on the world data for production

The projected impact of the proposed experiment, assuming the (5/2+, 3/2-) case with 5% coupling is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:impact]. These results will dramatically enhance our knowledge of photo-production near threshold. The absolute cross section measurements from this experiment will provide valuable input for future experimental endeavors at CLAS12 and SoLID [\cite=CLAS12-tcs:proposal] [\cite=SoLIDjpsi:proposal].

Run plan and beam request

We propose to carry the measurement of elastic photo-production of in the threshold region with the aim to confirm the LHCb Pc(4450) discovery. The experiment uses the standard equipment of the upgraded Hall C apparatus at Jefferson Lab. We request 11 days (264 hours) of beam time. The first 40 hours will focus on measuring the shape of the t distribution with high statistics, using setting #2 to maximize the combined acceptance for this process. We will take an additional 8 hours of data in this setting without the radiator, in order to assess the contribution from lepto-production. Finally, we will conduct our main measurement in setting #1 for the remaining 216 hours. See Tab. [\ref=table:kin] for the definitions of the spectrometer settings #1 and #2. Accidental coincidences between the two spectrometers will be measured at the same setting and the same time in the momentum acceptance of the spectrometers outside the true physics events.

We request 11 days to perform this high-impact measurement in search of the LHCb charmed exotic resonances consistent with "pentaquarks".
