Adjoint map of Serre derivative and special values of shifted Dirichlet series

Introduction

For any positive integer k  ≥  4, let Mk(Γ) be the space of modular forms of weight k for a congruence subgroup Γ of [formula]. For even k  ≥  2, the Eisenstein series of weight k is given by

[formula]

where Bk is the kth Bernoulli number, [formula], q = e2πiz, and z is in the upper-half plane H. For k  ≥  4 and even, the Eisenstein series Ek defines a modular form of weight k for [formula]. The Eisenstein series E2 and the derivative [formula] of f∈Mk(Γ) do not satisfy the modular property. But by taking a certain linear combination of Df and E2f, we get a function which transforms like a modular form of weight k + 2. The underlying map on Mk(Γ) is called as Serre derivative, denoted by ϑk and given in section [\ref=serre]. We first show that the Serre derivative is a [formula] linear map from Sk(Γ) to Sk + 2(Γ) which are finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this article our purpose is to find the adjoint map of the Serre derivative with respect to the Petersson inner product. It gives construction of a cusp form of weight k with interesting Fourier coefficients, from a given cusp form of weight k + 2.

Using the properties of Poincaré series and adjoint of linear maps, W. Kohnen in [\cite=kohnen] constructed the adjoint map of the product map by a fixed cusp form, with respect to the Petersson scalar product. After Kohnen's work computing adjoint of product map and its generalization, which can be defined by using Rankin-Cohen brackets, in the various spaces have attracted the attention of many mathematicians since the Fourier coefficients of image of a form involve special values of certain shifted Dirichlet series attached to these forms, e.g. generalization to Jacobi forms (see [\cite=ckk], [\cite=ajbs] and [\cite=sakata]), Siegel modular forms (see [\cite=lee] and [\cite=ajbs2]), Hilbert modular forms (see [\cite=wang]) and half integral weight modular forms (see [\cite=ajkm]).

In our case also, the Fourier coefficients of image of f∈Sk + 2(Γ) under the adjoint of Serre derivative, involve special values of certain shifted Dirichlet series associated with Fourier coefficients of f. As an application we obtained relations among the coefficients of modular forms and special values of these shifted Dirichlet series. Moreover we have also given the asymptotic bound of the special values of this shifted Dirichlet series. E2 and derivative of a modular form are quasimodular forms which do not satisfy the modular transformation property. Hence we can not define the Petersson inner product in usual way in the space of quasimodular forms. But there is an isomorphism between the space of quasimodular forms and the space of nearly holomorphic modular forms and we can define the Petersson inner product in the space of nearly holomorphic modular forms. Therefore, sometimes it is convenient to switch our problems from quasimodular forms to nearly holomorphic modular forms and vice versa. By transforming the definition of Serre derivative in the context of nearly holomorphic modular forms, by the means of Mass Shimura operator δk and E*2 (see section [\ref=ref] for notations), we can compute the adjoint map explicitly. We emphasize that our proof can be carried out in the setting of half integral weight forms to construct cusp forms of half integer weight.

Basic tools and notation

Let μΓ denote the index of Γ in [formula]. Unless otherwise stated we assume that [formula]. For [formula] define the slash operator as follows

[formula]

We will denote by Mk(Γ,χ) (resp. Sk(Γ,χ)) the space of modular forms (resp. cusp forms) of weight k for a congruence subgroup Γ of level N and Dirichlet character χ (mod N). We write Mk(N) (resp. Sk(N)) for the corresponding spaces if Γ  =  Γ0(N) and χ to be a trivial character.

Let k and n be positive integers. The nth Poincaré series of weight k for a congruence subgroup Γ is defined by

[formula]

It is well known that Pk,n∈Sk(Γ) for k > 2 and it can be characterized by the following property.

Let f∈Sk(Γ) with Fourier expansion [formula] Then

The following familiar lemma tells about the growth of Fourier coefficients of a modular form.

If f∈Mk(Γ,χ) with Fourier coefficients a(n), then a(n)  ≪  |n|k - 1 + ε, and moreover, if f is a cusp form, then [formula], for any ε > 0.

Nearly holomorphic modular forms

For the convenience of the reader we repeat the relevant material from [\cite=shimura] in our setting without proofs, thus making our exposition self-contained.

A nearly holomorphic modular form f of weight k and depth ≤  p for Γ is a polynomial in [formula] of degree ≤  p whose coefficients are holomorphic functions on H with moderate growth such that

[formula]

for any [formula] and z∈H, where [formula] is the imaginary part of z.

Let ≤  pk(Γ) denote the space of all nearly holomorphic modular forms of weight k and depth ≤  p for Γ. We denote by [formula] the space of all nearly holomorphic modular forms of weight k. Note that

[formula]

is a nearly holomorphic modular form of weight 2 for the group [formula].

The Maass-Shimura operator δk on f∈k(Γ) is defined by

[formula]

The operator δk takes k(Γ) to k + 2(Γ).

Let f∈k(Γ). Then f is called a

rapidly decreasing function at every cusp of Γ if for each [formula] and positive real number c, there exist positive constants A and B depending on f, α and c such that

[formula]

slowly increasing function at every cusp of Γ if for each [formula] there exist positive constants A, B and c depending on f and α such that

[formula]

Let f,g∈k(Γ) be such that the product fg is rapidly decreasing function then the inner product is defined by

[formula]

By abuse of notation, we used the same symbol here for Petersson inner product as in the case of modular forms. The integral is convergent because of the hypothesis and hence the inner product is well defined.

We will now state a particular case of [\cite=shimura] which will play a crucial role in the proof of our main result.

Let Γ be a congruence subgroup and let f∈Sk + 2(Γ). Then 〈f,δkg〉  =  0 for any g∈Mk(Γ).

A shifted Dirichlet series

Let [formula] and [formula]. For [formula], define a shifted Dirichlet series of Rankin type as in [\cite=kohnen] by

[formula]

If the coefficients a(n) and b(n)'s have appropriate bound, then Lf,g,m(s) converges absolutely in some half plane. For f∈Sk(Γ,χ) and a non negative integer m, consider a shifted Dirichlet series of Rankin type associated with f and E2 denoted by Lf,m(s) and defined by

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=bound], Lf,m(s) is absolutely convergent for Re[formula] and has meromorphic continuation to [formula]. A slightly different shifted Dirichlet series of this kind associated with two modular forms was first introduced by Selberg in [\cite=selberg]. Recently J. Hoffstein and Hulse in [\cite=hohu] rigorously investigated the meromorphic continuation of a variant of Selberg's shifted Dirichlet series and multiple shifted Dirichlet series. Mertens and Ono in [\cite=meon] proved that certain special values of symmetrized sum of such functions involve as the coefficients of sum of mixed mock modular forms and quasimodular forms which p-adic properties has been studied in [\cite=bmo].

Serre derivative

It is well known [\cite=ono] that for positive integer k and f∈Mk(Γ) the function

[formula]

is a modular form of weight k + 2 for Γ. The weight k operator ϑk defined by [\eqref=serredef] is called as Serre derivative (or sometimes Ramanujan-Serre differential operator). It is an interesting and useful operator because of the following property where we see that it can be acted on modular forms for any congruence subgroup with character and preserves cusp forms.

Let k be a non negative integer. Then the weight k operator ϑk maps Mk(Γ,χ) to Mk + 2(Γ,χ) and Sk(Γ,χ) to Sk + 2(Γ,χ). In particular ϑk maps Sk(N) to Sk + 2(N).

Let [formula]. Using the transformation formula of E2, a straightforward calculation gives

[formula]

from which the first assertion follows that ϑkf∈Mk + 2(Γ,χ), if f∈Mk(Γ,χ). From [\eqref=Dftrans], it is also clear that ϑk preserve the cuspidal condition by noting the action of differential map D on q - expansion.

Main theorem and applications

From Theorem [\ref=serretrans] we know that ϑk:Sk(Γ)  →  Sk + 2(Γ) is a [formula] linear map of finite dimensional Hilbert space and hence has an adjoint map ϑ*k:Sk + 2(Γ)  →  Sk(Γ), such that

[formula]

In the main result we exhibit the Fourier coefficients of ϑ*kf for f∈Sk + 2(Γ). Its mth Fourier coefficient involve special values of the shifted Dirichlet series Lf,m(s). Now we shall state the main theorem of this article.

Let k [formula] 2. The image of any f∈Sk + 2(Γ) with Fourier expansion [formula] under ϑ*k is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Applications

Asymptotic bound for Lf,m(k + 1)

Let f∈Sk + 2(Γ) and Γ be a congruence subgroup of level N. From Theorem [\ref=main], we can write Here c(m) is the mth Fourier coefficient of ϑ*kf which is a cusp form of weight k. Hence in view of Lemma [\ref=bound], a direct calculation gives

[formula]

Lf,m(k + 1) in terms of Fourier coefficients

For some [formula] and a congruence subgroup Γ, let Sk(Γ) be the one dimensional space generated by f. Then applying above Theorem, we get ϑ*kg(z) = αgf(z) for any g∈Sk + 2(Γ), where αg is a constant. Now equating the mth Fourier coefficients both the sides, we get relation among the special values of shifted Dirichlet series associated with g and with the Fourier coefficients of f. We give following numerical example.

From now on, Δk,N will denote the unique normalized cusp form with Fourier coefficients τk,N in Sk(N), if it is one dimensional space. We will also write Δ(z) for Δ12,1(z). Consider the map ϑ10:S10(2)  →  S12(2). Since [formula] and [formula], a direct computation shows that

[formula]

Let [formula] By using the property of adjoint map and above we have,

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

From [\cite=chi], we know that [formula]. Using above expression in [\eqref=alpha], we get α  =  0 which gives

[formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=main], we get

[formula]

[formula]

Since

[formula]

Hence, [\eqref=beta] gives

[formula]

We put, [formula] where [formula] if m is odd. So by using Theorem [\ref=main] in the expression [formula], we get

[formula]

In particular for odd m, we have

[formula]

Note that in the same way, many other relations can be derived and properties of shifted Dirichlet series can be observed of this sort.

Proof of the Theorem [\ref=main]

We need the following Lemma to prove the main theorem.

Using the same notation in Theorem [\ref=main], we have converges.

Since f is a cusp form of weight k, therefore fE*2 is nearly holomorphic modular form of weight k + 2, rapidly decreasing at every cusps and hence for some positive constant M, we have

[formula]

Changing the variable z to γ- 1z and using standard Rankin unfolding argument, the sum in Lemma [\ref=interchange] equals to

[formula]

Now we give a proof of the Theorem [\ref=main]. Put [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=poincare-lemma],

[formula]

By considering above inner product in the space of nearly holomorphic modular forms and using Lemma [\ref=ip0], we get

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Now consider,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=interchange], we can interchange summation and integration in above expression. Using Rankin unfolding argument, the integral in above expression can be written as

[formula]

In [\eqref=suminterchange] we can justify the interchange of sum and integral by Lemma [\ref=bound]. Hence

[formula]

It proves the theorem.
