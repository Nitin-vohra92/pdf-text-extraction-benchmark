Boundary behavior of the squeezing functions of complex domains

Denote by [formula] the unit ball in [formula] Let M be an n-dimensional complex manifold, and p∈M. For any holomorphic embedding [formula] with f(p) = 0, set

[formula]

The squeezing function of M is defined by [formula] if such f's exist, and [formula] otherwise.

If [formula] then M is said to be uniformly squeezing.

Many properties and applications of the squeezing function and the uniformly squeezing manifolds have been explored by various authors, see e.g. [\cite=DGZ1] [\cite=DGZ2] [\cite=DF] [\cite=DFW] [\cite=FW] [\cite=KZ].

By [\cite=KZ], any convex bounded domain in [formula] is uniformly squeezing. Our first aim is to extend this result to a larger class of domains.

A domain D in [formula] is called [formula]-convex if any non-empty intersection of D with a complex line is a simply connected domain. Then [formula] is a union of hyperplanes (see e.g. [\cite=APS]). This easily implies that if D is degenerate, i.e. containing complex lines, then D is linearly equivalent to [formula] and hence sD = 0.

On the other hand, we have the following.

There exists a constant cn > 0 such that sD  ≥  cn for any non-degenerate [formula]-convex domain D in [formula]

We shall use the idea of the proof of [\cite=KZ] (as our proof will be shorter).

Let p∈D. We may suppose that p = 0. Denote by lj the j-th coordinate line and choose a point [formula] such that [formula] Since the squeezing function is invariant under biholomorphisms, we may assume that |pj| = 1. Then D contains the 1-norm unit ball in [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=NPZ]) and hence [formula] where [formula]

Choose now a hyperplane Hj through pj which is disjoint from D. Note that the projection Gj of D onto lj in direction of Hj is a simply connected domain (see e.g. [\cite=APS]). Let φj be the conformal map from Gj onto [formula] with φj(0) = 0 and [formula] Since (0,∂Gj) = 1, then [formula] by the Köbe quarter theorem. Thus, [formula] where c is the schlicht Bloch-Landau constant.

So, for [formula] one has that [formula] which easily implies the desired result.

As an application of Proposition 1, we shall prove briefly one of the main results in [\cite=NPZ] (whose original proof is close to that of [\cite=KZ]). Denote by γD, κD and βD the Carathéodory, the Kobayashi and the Bergman metrics of D. It is well-known that γD  ≤  κD and γD  ≤  βD (if βD is well-defined). Moreover, if D is a convex, resp. [formula]-convex, domain, then γD  =  κD by the Lempert theorem, resp. [formula] by [\cite=NPZ]. Then Proposition 1 and the estimate

[formula]

(see e.g. [\cite=DF]) imply [\cite=NPZ]:

βD is comparable with γD and κD on any non-degenerate [formula]-convex domain D in [formula] up to multiplicative constants depending only on n.

Our second result is about the boundary behavior of the squeezing function near a smooth boundary point of a plane domain.

By [\cite=DGZ1], resp. [\cite=DGZ2], if D is a smooth bounded domain in [formula] resp. a strictly pseudoconvex domain in [formula] then

[formula]

To refine this result in the plane, recall that a bounded domain D in [formula] is said to be Dini-smooth if the inner unit normal vector n to ∂D is Dini-continuous. This means that [formula] where ω(t) =  sup {|nx - ny|:|x - y| < t, x,y∈∂D} is the modulus of continuity of n.

A boundary point a of a domain D in [formula] is called Dini-smooth if there exists a neighborhood U of a such that [formula] is a Dini-smooth domain.

It is clear that C1 + ε-smoothness implies Dini-smoothness.

Let D be a plane domain and a∈∂D.

(a) If a is Dini-smooth, then [formula] where C depends only on the geometry of ∂D near a.

(b) If a is C1-smooth, then [formula]

As usual, δD is the distance to ∂D.

Proposition 2(a) is inspired by the same inequality in the case of C4-smooth strictly pseudoconvex domains, see [\cite=FW].

This result is optimal in two directions.

First, the inequality is sharp. Indeed, replacing [\cite=DFW] by [\cite=NA] in the proof of [\cite=DFW], we obtain the following:

If a is a Dini-smooth boundary point of a domain D in [formula] which is not biholomoprhic to the unit ball, then [formula]

Second, [\cite=DFW] shows that Proposition 2(a) may fail in the C1-smooth case.

Proof of Proposition 2. (a) One may find a neighborhood U of a such that [formula] is a Dini-smooth domain. Let b∈E, [formula] and [formula] Let [formula] be a conformal map. The Dini-smoothness implies that ψ extends to a C1-diffeomorphism from [formula] to [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=Pom]). Setting [formula] we may assume that θ(a) = 1 and that there exists r > 0 such that [formula] where [formula] It is easy to check that if [formula] [formula] [formula] and [formula] then [formula] for [formula] This implies that

[formula]

Letting c  →  1, and using that sD(z) = sG(θ(z)) and

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

It is clear that C depends only on the geometry of ∂D near a.

(b) We may proceed as above, having in mind that now ψ extends to a homeomorphism from [formula] to [formula].
