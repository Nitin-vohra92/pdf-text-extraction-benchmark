Every Schnyder Drawing is a Greedy Embedding

Greedy Routing on Planar Triangular Graphs

In this manuscript, we establish some results on greedy routing on planar triangular graphs. Planar triangular graphs are a special class of graphs, where every face of the graph is a triangle, including the external face. Hence the outer-face consists of three nodes A1,A2 and A3.

We consider the problem of greedy routing [\cite=bose1999online] on such graphs. In order to perform geometric routing, the graph has to be drawn on a certain geometric space. Such a drawing is called a greedy embedding [\cite=papadimitriou2004conjecture], which is defined as follows.

Greedy Embedding A greedy embedding is an embedding of a graph on a respective geometric space such that, greedy routing always succeeds. In other words, between every node pair u,v there is another node w adjacent to u, such that d(u,v) > d(w,v), where d(.) is the underlying metric on the geometric space.

Dhandapani [\cite=dhandapani2010greedy] showed that every planar triangulated graph can be drawn on the plane as a greedy embedding. They generalize the classical Schnyder drawing [\cite=schnyder1990embedding] leading to a family of planar drawings, then they show that there exists a greedy drawing in this set of drawings.

In this work, we prove that every Schnyder drawing is a greedy embedding. We emphasize the use of a generalized definition of a greedy routing [\cite=li2010rules], on which our algorithm is based.

Schnyder Drawing

Given a planar triangular graph, a Schnyder drawing [\cite=schnyder1990embedding] is a straight line drawing of the graph on the plane. In this article, we consider such a drawing on [formula], such that the external nodes A1,A2 and A3 are placed on (1,0,0),(0,1,0) and (0,0,1) respectively. Hence the external face forms an equilateral triangle and the nodes are placed on the plane designated by x + y + z = 1.

The Schnyder drawing is computed based on a combinatorial description of a planar triangular graph, which is called a realizer, defined as follows.

Realizer[\cite=schnyder1990embedding] Given a plane triangulation G(V,E), there exist three directed edge-disjoint trees, T1,T2 and T3, namely the realizer of G, such that for each inner vertex u;

u has an outgoing edge in each of T1,T2 and T3

the counterclockwise order of the edges incident on v is as follows: leaving in T1, entering in T3, leaving in T2, entering T1, leaving in T3, entering in T2

The Schnyder planar drawing algorithm [\cite=schnyder1990embedding], initially constructs a realizer in linear time. A realizer, in turn leads to three paths from each node towards their root nodes in each tree. These paths partition the nodes into three regions Ri such that i = 1,2,3. Let ni be the total number of nodes in region Ri including the nodes in the two paths, those border the region Ri. Now Schnyder algorithm places each node u on [formula] leading to a planar drawing (see [\cite=nishizeki2004planar] for details) [\cite=schnyder1990embedding].

We present two important properties of a Schnyder drawing in Lemma [\ref=threewedge] and [\ref=lem:enclosing], which are illustrated in Figures [\ref=fig:threewedge] and [\ref=fig:enclosing]

Schnyder drawing leads to an important void region around and out-going edge as constitutes in Lemma [\ref=lem:enclosing]

In the following section, we introduce the definition of a saturated graph and show that every Schnyder drawing implies a saturated graph.

Saturated Graph

In [\cite=leone2016greedy], we introduced the concept of saturated graphs and show that there exists a local greedy routing algorithm with guaranteed delivery on such graphs. Definition of a saturated graph is purely combinatorial, but to construct those properties we use an underlying virtual coordinate system namely, virtual raw anchor coordinate (VRAC) system [\cite=leone2016greedy]. In the following, we describe the construction of a saturated graph, given a Schnyder drawing of a planar triangular graph.

Let G(V,E) is the graph in concern, where V is the set of vertices(nodes) and E is the set of edges, which is a planar triangular graph. Consider a Schnyder drawing of G, where the outer face is drawn as an equilateral triangle. We denote the three outer vertices as A1,A2 and A3. Let every node computes the distance from the edges of the outer-triangle and assign them as its coordinate as illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:coordinates], which is in fact the VRAC system. Based on this coordinate assignment, we can define three order relations on the set of nodes V as follows.

The three order relations <  i, i = 1,2,3 on V  ×  V are defined by

These three orders permit the definition of sectors associated with a node u.

We define the following sectors associated with a node u∈V. Note that the reference node u does not belong either of to the sectors. As depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:coordinates], sectors sui correspond to the labeled regions.

[formula]

Based on this characterization, Leone et.al [\cite=huc2012efficient], proposed a distributed planarization algorithm, assuming a unit disk communication graph model. They used the following planarization criterion, where they derive a planar sub-graph [formula].

The vertex set [formula] and

[formula]

Algorithmically, to obtain a planar graph, each node retains only the minimum edge in each sector Su1,Su3 and Su5. The minimum edge in a given sector is determined based on a partial order corresponds for each sector. Such a partial order is defined considering the intersection of three orders (<  i, i = 1,2,3) in a given sectors (see [\cite=huc2012efficient] for details). Note that given an arbitrary graph, these three sectors may not have edges and there can be arbitrary number of incoming edges to a node in sectors Su2,Su4 and Su6. A saturated graph is a special case of this setting, which is defined as below.

A planar graph is saturated if there exists exactly one edge in each sector su2i - 1,i = 1,2,3 for each node u.

We present the following result from [\cite=leone2016greedy] on greedy routing on saturated graphs.

There is a greedy routing algorithm on every saturated planar graph.

Schnyder drawings and saturated graphs

A saturated graph is defined without a reference to an embedding. Our greedy routing algorithm in [\cite=leone2016greedy], uses the saturated graph property to prove the delivery guarantees. Following lemma constitutes a straight forward relationship between a Schnyder drawing and a saturated graph.

Due to the three wedge property of a Schnyder drawing (see Lemma [\ref=threewedge]), we know that there is exactly one edge (u,vi) in sectors sui where i = 1,3,5. Moreover due to the enclosing triangle property(see Lemma [\ref=lem:enclosing]) of a Schnyder drawing, there is no node w such that w < jv where j = 1,2,3. Hence it follows the criterion for a saturated edge as in equation [\ref=minprop], implying a saturated graph.

In [\cite=leone2016greedy], we devised a greedy routing algorithm which guarantees delivery, when the graph is saturated. Note that in [\cite=leone2016greedy], we do not use a metric to define the greedy path, instead use a generalized definition of a greedy path. Following lemma concludes the resulting connection between greedy embeddings and a Schnyder drawing of a planar triangular graph.

Every Schnyder drawing is a greedy embedding.
