Strangeness in STAR at RHIC

Introduction

The main motivations of the experiments of heavy-ion collision at RHIC are 1) generating the new form of matter Quark Gluon Plasma at high energy collisions and studying its properties, and 2) exploring the QCD phase structure by scanning the collision energy from 200 to 7.7 GeV. Strangeness production is regarded as a sensitive probe to the phase transition, because the strange quark mass is supposed to be much higher than system temperature in hadronic phase, but lower than system temperature in partonic phase [\cite=introduction]. In addition, the hadronic interaction cross sections for strange hadrons, especially for multi-strange hadrons Ξ, Ω and φ mesons are expected to be small and their freeze-out temperatures are close to the quark-hadron transition temperature predicted by lattice QCD [\cite=white] [\cite=multistrange1] [\cite=multistrange2]. Hence, these hadrons are expected to provide information primarily from the partonic stage of the collision. They are good probes to study the QGP properties and explore the QCD phase structure. The STAR experiment has covered the beam energies of [formula] = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. The extracted baryonic chemical potental (μB) range based on a statistical model [\cite=statmodel] from the 0-5% central collisions is [formula] which covers a wide region of the QCD phase diagram. In these proceedings, we will focus on the following observables for strange and multi-strange hadrons: elliptic flow v2, nuclear modification factor RCP and baryon to meson ratio.

Results and Discussions

In the RHIC runs of year 2010 and 2011, about 730 million minimum bias events of Au + Au collisions at [formula] = 200 GeV were recorded by STAR. Sufficient statistics of multi-strange hadrons and φ mesons support the precise measurements on v2. Figure [\ref=figure1] shows the v2 as a function of pT for (a) pions, protons and (b) φ, Ω in Au + Au collisions at [formula] = 200 GeV for 0-80% centrality [\cite=paper]. A comparison between v2 of pions and protons, consisting of up ([formula]) and down ([formula]) light constituent quarks is shown in panel (a). Correspondingly, panel (b) shows a comparison of v2 of φ and Ω containing [formula] constituent quarks. This is the first time that high precision measurement of Ω baryon v2 up to 4.5 GeV/c is available in experiments of heavy-ion collisions. In the low pT region ( pT <   2.0 GeV/c), the v2 of φ and Ω follows mass ordering. At intermediate pT ( 2.0 <   pT <   5.0 GeV/c), a baryon-meson separation is observed. It is evident that the v2(pT) of hadrons consisting only of strange constituent quarks (φ and Ω) is similar to that of light hadrons, pions and protons. However the φ and Ω do not participate strongly in the hadronic interactions, because of the smaller hadronic cross sections compared to pions and protons. It suggests the major part of the collectivity is developed during the partonic phase in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Experimental measurements indicate partonic collectivity has been built up in top energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The φ mesons and protons show different sensitivity to the hadronic rescatterings. The φ mesons are less sensitive to the late hadron hadron interactions than light hadrons due to the smaller hadronic cross section. Hydrodynamical model calculations predict that v2 as a function of pT for different particle species follows mass ordering, where the v2 of heavier hadrons is lower than that of lighter hadrons. Hirano et al. predict the mass ordering of v2 could be broken between φ mesons and protons at low pT (pT [formula] 1.5 GeV/c) based on a model with ideal hydrodynamics with hadron cascade process [\cite=hyrdo_cascade]. As the model calculations assign a smaller hadronic cross section for φ mesons compared to protons, the broken mass ordering is regarded as the different hadronic rescattering contributions on the φ meson and proton v2. Figure [\ref=figure2] shows the ratios of φ v2 to proton v2 from model calculations and experimental data [\cite=paper]. This ratio is larger than unity at pT ~   0.5 GeV/c for 0-30% centrality. It indicates breakdown of the expected mass ordering in that momentum range. This could be due to a large effect of hadronic rescatterings on the proton v2. The data of 0-80% centrality around 0.5 GeV/c quantitatively agrees with hydro + hadron cascade calculations indicated by the shaded red band in panel (a) of Fig. [\ref=figure2], even though there is a deviation in higher pT bins. A centrality dependence of v2(φ) to v2(p) ratio is observed in the experimental data. The breakdown of mass ordering of v2 is more pronounced in 0-30% central collisions than in 30-80% peripheral collisions. In the central events, both hadronic and partonic interactions are stronger than in peripheral events. Therefore, the larger effect of late stage hadronic interactions relative to the partonic collectivity produces a greater breakdown of mass ordering in the 0-30% centrality data than in the 30-80%. This observation indirectly supports the idea that the φ meson has a smaller hadronic interaction cross section. The ratio of φ v2 to proton v2 was also studied by using the transport models AMPT [\cite=ampt] and UrQMD [\cite=urqmd]. The panel (b) of Fig. [\ref=figure2] shows the v2(φ) to v2(p) ratio for 0-30% centrality from AMPT and UrQMD models. The black shaded band is from AMPT with a hadronic cascade time of 0.6 fm/c while the yellow band is for a hadronic cascade time of 30 fm/c. Larger hadronic cascade time is equivalent to stronger hadronic interactions. It is clear that the v2(φ) / v2(p) ratio increases with increasing hadronic cascade time. This is attributed to a decrease in the proton v2 due to an increase in hadronic rescattering while the φ meson v2 is less affected. The ratios from the UrQMD model are much smaller than unity (shown as a brown shaded band in the panel (b) of Fig. [\ref=figure2]). The UrQMD model lacks partonic collectivity, thus the φ meson v2 is not fully developed. None of these models could describe the detailed shape of the pT dependence.

The most striking feature on the v2 measurements from RHIC Beam Energy Scan program is the observation of an energy dependent difference in v2 between particles and their corresponding antiparticles [\cite={BES}]. Figure [\ref=figure3] shows the difference in v2 between particles and their corresponding antiparticles as a function of beam energy. The difference between baryon and anti-baryon is much more pronounced than difference between mesons. Proton versus anti-proton and Λ versus Λ̄ show same magnitude of difference. This difference naturally breaks the number of constituent quark scaling (NCQ) in v2 which is regarded as an evidence of partonic collectivity in the top energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. It indicates the hadronic degrees of freedom play a more important role at lower collision energies.

The RCP is defined as the ratios of particle yields in central collisions over those in peripheral ones scaled by the number of inelastic binary collisions. Here, Nbin is determined from Monte Carlo Glauber model calculations. The RCP of K0S, Λ, Ξ and Ω in Au+Au 7.7 - 39 GeV collisions are presented in Fig. [\ref=figure4] [\cite=usman]. The RCP will be unity if nucleus-nucleus collisions are just simple superpositions of nucleon-nucleon collisions. Deviation of these ratios from unity would imply contributions from nuclear or medium effects. At collision energy ≥   19.6 GeV, the RCP of K0S ≤   1 at pT >   1.5 GeV/c and much less than those of baryons. The high pT suppression of K0S and baryon/meson separation is qualitatively consistent with results from RHIC higher energies [\cite=STARBES]. However, for collisions at 14.5 GeV and below, the data seem to be qualitatively different from those from higher energies. There is no suppression for K0S at pT >   1.5 GeV/c, and at intermediate pT the baryon/meson separation becomes less significant. It suggests that different properties of the system have been created in collisions at 14.5 GeV and below compared to those from high energies.

The enhancement of baryon to meson ratios at intermediate pT compared to elementary collisions is interpreted as a consequence of hadron formation from parton recombination and parton collectivity [\cite=STARBES]. Therefore, the baryon to meson ratios are expected to be sensitive to parton dynamics of the collision system. Figure [\ref=figure5] shows the ratio of Λ̄ / K0S as a function of pT in Au + Au collisions at 7.7 - 39 GeV at mid-rapidity |y|  <  0.5 [\cite=usman]. The ratios of Λ̄ to K0S at intermediate pT are close to each other at 27 and 39 GeV, and show a slight decrease at 19.6 GeV. There is a sudden decrease of intermediate pT ratios between 19.6 and 14.5 GeV. Besides, the separation of central (0-5%) and peripheral (40-60%) collisions in the ratio becomes less obvious in collisions at 14.5 GeV and below. It suggests a possible change of underlying hadron formation mechanism and/or parton dynamics between these two energies. We use multi-strange hadrons, Ω to φ ratios, to further study the energy dependence of baryon to meson ratios. We present the results as a function of pT for Au+Au collisions at 7.7 to 200 GeV in Fig. [\ref=figure6] [\cite=multistrange_pro]. A model calculation by Hwa and Yang for Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV predicted that most of the Ω and φ yields up to the intermediate pT region are from coalescence of thermal strange quarks [\cite=recombination]. The straight dotted line assumed that these thermal strange quarks have exponential pT distributions. Deviations from the straight line at high pT were attributed to recombination with strange quarks from high pT showers. The measured ratios from central Au+Au collisions at 19.6, 27 and 39 GeV follow closely the ratio from 200 GeV and are consistent with a picture of coalescence dynamics over a broad pT range of 1-4 GeV/c. The ratios at 11.5 GeV seem to deviate from the trend observed at higher beam energies. In particular, the ratios appear to turn down around pT of 2 GeV/c. The decrease in the Ω to φ ratios from central collisions at 11.5 GeV compared to those at 19.6 GeV or above may indicate a significant change in the hadron formation and/or in strange quark pT distributions at the lower energy. Such a change may arise from a transition from hadronic to partonic dynamics with increasing beam energy.

Summary

In summary, the high precision v2 data of multi-strange hadrons, especially for Ω baryon and φ meson prove the partonic collectivity has been built-up at top energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The violation of mass ordering between φ mesons and protons at low pT supports φ mesons are less sensitive to late hadronic interactions. K0S RCP increases with decreasing beam energies indicating that partonic energy loss effect is less important at lower energy. The separation of central and peripheral Λ̄ / K0S ratio is not obvious in collisions at 14.5 GeV and below and the decrease in the Ω to φ ratios from central collisions at 11.5 GeV suggest the change of medium property and phase transition possibly happen between 19.6 GeV and lower energies.
