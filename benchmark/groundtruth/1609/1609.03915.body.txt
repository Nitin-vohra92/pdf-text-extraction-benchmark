some result on escaping set of an entire function

introduction

Let f be a transcendental entire function. For [formula] let fn denote the n-th iterate of f.

The set

[formula]

is called the Fatou set of f or the set of normality of f and its complement J(f) is the Julia set of f. An introduction to the basic properties of these sets can be found in [\cite=bergweiler]. The escaping set of f denoted by I(f) is the set of points in the complex plane that tend to infinity under iteration of f. In general, it is neither an open nor a closed subset of [formula] and has interesting topological properties. For a transcendental entire function f, the escaping set was studied for the first time by Eremenko  [\cite=e1] who established that

[formula]

J(f) = ∂I(f);

[formula]

[formula] has no bounded components.

For the exponential maps of the form f(z) = ez  +  λ with λ >  - 1, it is known, by Rempe [\cite=R2], that the escaping set is a connected subset of the plane, and for λ <  - 1, it is the disjoint union of uncountably many curves to infinity, each of which is connected component of I(f) [\cite=R4](These maps have no critical points and exactly one asymptotic value which is the omitted value λ).

Recall that [formula] is a critical value of a transcendental entire function f if there exist some [formula] with f(w0) = w and f'(w0) = 0. Here w0 is called a critical point of f. The image of a critical point of f is critical value of f. Also recall that [formula] is an asymptotic value of a transcendental entire function f if there exist a curve Γ tending to infinity such that f(z)  →  ζ as z  →    ∞   along Γ. The set of critical values and asymptotic values of f will be denoted by CV(f) and AV(f) respectively.

For the Eremenko-Lyubich class

[formula]

(where Sing(f- 1) is the set of critical values and asymptotic values of f and their finite limit points), it is known that I(f) is a subset of the Julia set J(f), [\cite=EL]. Each f∈B is said to be of bounded type. Also if f and g are of bounded type, then so is [formula] [\cite=berg2]. It was shown in  [\cite=SZ] that every escaping point of every exponential map can be connected to ∞   by a curve consisting of escaping points.

A set W is forward invariant under f if f(W)  ⊂  W and W is backward invariant under f if [formula] Moreover, W is called completely invariant under f if it is both forward and backward invariant under f. Two functions f and g are called permutable or commuting if [formula] Denote the right half plane by [formula]

In this article, we discuss some relation between escaping sets of two permutable entire functions. In addition, we investigate some dynamical properties of the map f(z) = z + 1 + e- z.

results

Recall that if g and h are entire functions and [formula] is a non constant continuous function such that [formula] then we say that g and h are semiconjugated (by f) and f is called a semiconjugacy. This definition first appeared in [\cite=berg5] where it was shown that for given entire functions g and h, there are at most countable number of entire functions f such that [formula]

If g and h are semiconjugated by f then f- 1(I(h))  ⊂  I(g).

Let w∈f- 1(I(h)). Then hn(f(w))  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  , which in turn implies f(gn(w))  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  . But this implies that gn(w) must tend to ∞  , that is, w∈I(g) and hence the result.

The particular case when f is entire and h = g gives

Let f and g be transcendental entire functions satisfying [formula] Then g(I(f))  ⊃  I(f).

The result can be extended up to closure of the escaping set.

Let f and g be entire functions and [formula] Then [formula]

Suppose [formula] Then there exist a sequence {zn}  ⊂  I(f) such that zn  →  w as n  →    ∞  . Denote a continuous branch of g- 1 by g- 1 itself, we get that g- 1(zn)  →  g- 1(w) as n  →    ∞  . Using Corollary [\ref=sec2] [\ref=cor1] we get g- 1(zn)  ⊂  I(f) and so [formula] and hence the result.

Let f and g be transcendental entire functions of bounded type satisfying [formula] Then

I(f) and I(g) are backward invariant under [formula]

If w∉I(f) then g(w)∉I(f);

Suppose [formula] such that [formula] Then [formula] as n  →    ∞  , that is, g(fn + 1(w))  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  . As g is an entire function, this implies that fn + 1 must tend to ∞   as n  →    ∞   and hence w∈I(f). On similar lines, one can show that I(g) is backward invariant under [formula] This completes the proof of the result.

If g(w)∈I(f), then fn(g(w))  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  , that is, g(fn(w))  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  . As g is an entire function, this implies fn(w) must tend to ∞   as n  →    ∞   contrary to our assumption and hence proves the result.

some properties of the map f = z + 1 + e- z

In this section we explore some dynamical properties of the map f(z) = z + 1 + e- z. Throughout this section, by f and g we will denote the map f(z) = z + 1 + e- z and g(z) = f(z) + 2πi, unless otherwise mentioned. We show in the next example that in general for two permutable entire functions f and g (where f(z) = z + 1 + e- z ), [formula] may not be contained in [formula] The function f appeared first in a paper of Fatou [\cite=F2]. In this paper, Fatou discussed the iterative behavior of transcendental entire functions and established some fundamental properties of the Fatou and Julia sets. He further posed some stimulating fundamental questions about the topological properties of the Julia set of a transcendental entire function which led to further developments.

Let f(z) = z + 1 + e- z and g(z) = f(z) + 2πi. It can be easily seen that [formula] F(f) has a Baker domain containing the right half plane [formula] and so f is not of bounded type. Observe that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let Fix(f) denote the fixed point set of f. Then [formula] For each z∈Fix(f),z∉I(f). Also for z∈Fix(f), we have

[formula]

which implies that [formula] Using Equation [\ref=eq2], we get z∈I(g). Hence [formula]

We now establish some invariance properties of I(f) and I(g) for the pair of commuting functions f(z) = z + 1 + e- z and g(z) = f(z) + 2πi. Observe that for [formula] f satisfies fl(z + 2pπi) = fl(z) + 2pπi.

For the pair of commuting functions f(z) = z + 1 + e- z and g(z) = f(z) + 2πi, g(I(f))  ⊂  I(f) and f(I(g))  ⊂  I(g).

We first show that g(I(f))  ⊂  I(f). To this end, let z∈I(f). Then for [formula]

[formula]

which implies g(z)∈I(f) and hence the result. We now show that f(I(g))  ⊂  I(g). Let w∈I(g). Consider for [formula]

[formula]

which implies f(w)∈I(g) and hence the result.

Using Corollary [\ref=sec2] [\ref=cor1] we get I(f) is completely invariant under g and I(g) is completely invariant under f. Also for each transcendental entire function h, I(h) is completely invariant under h we get that I(f) is completely invariant under [formula] On similar lines, I(g) is completely invariant under [formula]

An immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=sec2] [\ref=prop1] is

Let f and g be as in Proposition [\ref=sec2] [\ref=prop1]. Then [formula] and [formula]

It is not true in general that for an entire function h if [formula] then all components of F(h) are bounded. The entire function f(z) = z + 1 + e- z serves as an example for which F(f) is disjoint from the set of asymptotic values AV(f), but all components of F(f) are unbounded. In fact, from Example [\ref=sec2] [\ref=eg1], F(f) has a Baker domain containing the right half plane Hr. Observe that the critical values of f is the set [formula] so that Sing(f- 1) is unbounded.

Recall that the postsingular set of an entire function f is defined as

[formula]

An entire function h is called hyperbolic if the postsingular set P(h) is a compact subset of F(h). Recently [\cite=berg7] a characterization was given for boundedness of Fatou components of a hyperbolic entire function of bounded type.

[\cite=berg7] Let h be a hyperbolic entire function of bounded type. Then the following are equivalent:

every component of F(h) is bounded;

h has no asymptotic values and every component of F(h) contains at most finitely many critical points.

The entire functions f and g serves as an example of a pair of commuting functions which satisfies [formula] where Fix(f) denotes fixed point set of f. As computed in Example [\ref=sec2] [\ref=eg1], [formula] We assert that Fix(f)  ⊂  I(g). To this end, let z∈Fix(f). Then z = (2m + 1)iπ for some [formula] Consider

[formula]

so that z∈I(g) which proves the assertion and hence the result.

It can be easily seen that for an entire function h, int(I(h))  ⊂  F(h) where int(S) denotes interior of a subset S of a topological space X. For obvious reasons, if an entire function h is of bounded type then [formula] However, if h∉B then int(I(h)) can be non empty. Consider f(z) = z + 1 + e- z. As observed in Example [\ref=sec2] [\ref=eg1], F(f) has a Baker domain containing the right half plane Hr. In particular, Hr  ⊂  I(f) and hence [formula] This fact was also observed in [\cite=e1].

Recall that the order of a transcendental entire function h is defined as

[formula]

where

[formula]

For an entire function of finite order the number of critical values and asymptotic values are related. This is expressed in the following result

[\cite=berg8] If an entire function h of finite order ρh has only finitely many critical values, then it has at most 2ρ asymptotic values.

However, the function f(z) = z + 1 + e- z serves as an example of an entire function of finite order viz. 1 having infinitely many critical values (as computed before [formula]) but no finite asymptotic value (or at most 2 asymptotic value), so that the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=sec2] [\ref=lem1] still holds for an entire function of finite order having having infinitely many critical values.
