Introduction

This is the second part of a series of three papers on four-dimensional Painlevé-type equations associated with ramified linear equations. Let us outline the background of the study.

The Painlevé equations were found by Painlevé [\cite=P] and Gambier [\cite=Gm] at the beginning of the twentieth century, as a means to obtain new special functions. The Painlevé equations were originally classified into six equations. However, the geometry of the space of initial values [\cite=O1] shows that it is natural to classify them into eight equations [\cite=Sak1].

The Painlevé equations can be written in Hamiltonian form ([\cite=Ok] [\cite=OKSO]). Here we list the eight Hamiltonians instead of equations themselves:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Hamiltonian corresponding to the Jth Painlevé equation.

Around the same time as the discovery of the Painlevé equations, R. Fuchs [\cite=F] and Garnier [\cite=G] showed that the Painlevé equations can be derived from isomondromic deformations of certain second order linear differential equations. This connection of the Painlevé equations with linear differential equations are crucially important.

Among the Painlevé equations, the sixth Painlevé equation is the master equation in the sense that one can obtain all other Painlevé equations from the sixth Painlevé equation through degeneration. The relationships among the Painlevé equations through degeneration are shown in the scheme below.

The number placed in the upper half of each box is the singularity pattern of the associated linear equation: each number partitioned by + expresses the number "Poincaré rank +1" of each singular point of a linear differential equation. The definition of the Poincaré rank is given in Section [\ref=sec:HTLform].

The two kinds of arrows express the two kinds of degenerations for linear differential equations. Namely, the dashed arrows in the above scheme correspond to degeneration of HTL canonical forms (where HTL is an abbreviation for Hukuhara-Turrittin-Levelt, see Definition [\ref=df:HTL]) at irregular singular points, while the others correspond to confluence of singular points of associated linear equations.

What is important is that one can obtain all the Painlevé equations by considering confluence of singular points and degeneration of HTL canonical forms of associated linear equations [\cite=OO].

Recently, many generalizations of Painlevé equations based on various aspects have been proposed and studied. Our purpose is to understand them from a unified viewpoint. The point here is that they can be written as compatibility conditions of some linear differential equations. Namely, they can be regarded as isomonodromic deformation equations (or we use the term Painlevé-type equations synonymously). This fact allows us to classify them in terms of associated linear equations.

The scheme that we have seen in the above is the degeneration scheme of the isomonodromic deformation equations whose phase spaces are two-dimensional. Now we are interested in the degeneration scheme of the Painlevé-type equations of four-dimensional phase space, which comes next to the two-dimensional case.

In [\cite=KNS], the authors construct the degeneration scheme of four-dimensional Painlevé-type equations by means of confluence of singular points of associated linear equations. As the result, they obtained the degeneration scheme of four-dimensional Painlevé-type equations associated with unramified linear differential equations.

The aim of this series of papers is, by considering degeneration of HTL forms, to obtain the degeneration scheme of four-dimensional Painlevé-type equations that includes ones associated with ramified linear equations. This is expected to be the complete classification of the four-dimensional Painlevé-type equations since we expect that the above picture concerning two-dimensional case is also true in four-dimensional case.

There are four Painlevé-type equations which should be placed at the starting point of the degeneration scheme of four-dimensional case; that is, the Garnier system in two variables [\cite=G], the Fuji-Suzuki system (FS system for short) [\cite=FS1] [\cite=Ts], the Sasano system [\cite=Ss], and the sixth matrix Painlevé system [\cite=B2] [\cite=K]. The degeneration scheme of the sixth matrix Painlevé system is given in our previous paper [\cite=K1]. In the present paper, we construct the degeneration scheme of the Sasano system.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly recall HTL canonical forms of linear differential equations. We also see the examples of a shearing transformation and make some remarks on degeneration of HTL forms. In Section 3 we give the ramified Lax pairs and associated Hamiltonians which can be derived from the Sasano system. Section 4 is devoted to the description of correspondences of linear equations through the Laplace transform.

We give here the degeneration scheme of the Sasano system, which is the main result of the present paper.

HTL canonical forms and their degeneration

HTL canonical forms

Here we recall HTL canonical forms of systems of linear differential equations. Consider a linear system

[formula]

The transformation [formula] by an invertible matrix P(x) is called a gauge transformation. This corresponds to the change of the dependent variable Y = P(x)Z. Then Z satisfies

[formula]

Linear differential equations that we treat in this series of papers are systems with rational function coefficients:

[formula]

This system has singular points at [formula], and ∞  . Taking the local coordinates z = x - uν or z = 1 / x, we can write the system at z = 0 as follows:

[formula]

We denote the field of formal Laurent series in z by [formula], and the field of Puiseux series [formula] by Kz.

Here we give the definition of HTL canonical forms. Then the following theorem holds.

For any element A(z) in [formula]:

[formula]

there exists [formula] such that AP(z) is an HTL form:

[formula]

Here [formula] are uniquely determined only by the original system ([\ref=eq:Laurent2]).

If the following

[formula]

is another HTL canonical form corresponding to the same system, there exist a constant matrix [formula] and a natural number [formula] such that

[formula]

hold.

We call ([\ref=eq:HTLform]) the HTL canonical form (or HTL form) of ([\ref=eq:Laurent2]). The number l0 - 1 is called the Poincaré rank of the singular point. When there is a rational number lj that is not an integer, the singular point is called a ramified irregular singular point. A linear system is said to be of ramified type if it has a ramified irregular singular point.

HTL forms can be computed by means of block diagonalizations and shearing transformations. Here the block diagonalization means the following

Let A(z) be a formal Laurent series

[formula]

We write the eigenvalues of A0 as [formula] and their multiplicities [formula] respectively. Then we can choose a formal power series P(z) so that the gauge transformation by P(z) reduces ([\ref=eq:irreg_sys]) to the following form:

[formula]

where Bk0  =  λkImk + Nk with Nk being nilpotent.

We briefly explain shearing transformations in the next subsection. In this series of papers we use the notations what we call Riemann schemes and spectral types to express linear systems. The Riemann scheme and the spectral type of a linear system are defined by the HTL forms; see [\cite=K1].

Shearing transformations

Here we illustrate how the shearing transformations work, following [\cite=Wa]. By virtue of Proposition [\ref=thm:block_diag], it suffices to consider the following system

[formula]

where A0 is a Jordan matrix with only one eigenvalue. By means of a scalar gauge transformation, we can shift A0 by a scalar matrix. Thus, without loss of generality, we can assume that A0 is nilpotent.

Let [formula] and write the (i,j)-entry of Ã(z) as aij(z). We write a non-zero aij(z) as

[formula]

where αij is a non-negative integer. Note that at least one of the αi,i + 1's [formula] is zero.

Now let s be a positive constant and consider the gauge transformation by

[formula]

We denote the (i,j)-entry of zr + 1AS(z) by bij(z). If aij(z)  ≠  0, then

[formula]

We can write this (in a similar way as above) as bij(z) = zβijb*ij(z) (b*ij(0)  ≠  0) again. It is easy to see that βij is a linear function in s. Draw the graphs of β  =  βij(s) in (s,β)-plane. Consider the intersection points between the lines with negative slopes and the line β = s. Find the intersection point with smallest β-coordinate and write it as s0. Then let s = s0 in the shearing matrix S. We repeat this procedure so that the coefficient matrix of the leading term becomes diagonalizable.

Degeneration of HTL forms

In the case of the original Painlevé equations (with standard 2  ×  2 Lax pairs), the degenerations of HTL forms are caused by the degenerations of Jordan canonical forms of the leading coefficient matrix at irregular singular points. However, in general, degeneration of an HTL form does not always correspond to degeneration of a Jordan canonical form.

In this subsection, we make some comments on degeneration of HTL forms. For detailed calculations, see Appendix [\ref=sec:appendix].

We begin with a simple example. Let A(x) be the following Laurent series:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Here the coefficient matrix of the leading term becomes diagonalizable provided that a(1)21  ≠  0, and we find that the corresponding system of linear differential equations has x = 0 as an irregular singular point of Poincaré rank 1/2. The HTL form at x = 0 is

[formula]

If a(1)21 = 0, using [formula] instead of the above S, we have the different HTL form (we omit the details). This example shows us that if the leading matrix is a Jordan canonical form whose (1,2)-entry is one, then whether or not the (2,1)-entry of the next matrix is zero is meaningful.

Now we consider the degeneration (111)(1)  →  (1)211. We take the degeneration (111)(1),(2)(2)  →  (1)211,(2)(2) as an example. Note that the linear system (111)(1),(2)(2) is of the form [\cite=KNS]: where

[formula]

According to Appendix [\ref=sec:appendix], there exists an invertible matrix, say G, such that In other words, the semisimple matrix A∞ degenerates to a nilpotent matrix as ε tends to zero. The degeneration of this HTL form corresponds to the degeneration of the Jordan canonical form.

However, in the case of the degeneration (1)211  →  (1)31 (see, for example, (1)211,(2)(2)  →  (1)31,(2)(2) in Appendix [\ref=sec:appendix]), the Jordan canonical form of the leading coefficient does not change. Instead, the (2,1)-entry of the next matrix becomes zero, so that the HTL form (1)211 degenerates to (1)31.

Lax pairs of degenerate Sasano systems

The Sasano system was discovered by Sasano [\cite=Ss] in his study on a generalization of Painlevé equations from the viewpoint of spaces of initial values, and later it was obtained as a similarity reduction of the Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchy [\cite=FS2].

Sakai [\cite=Sak2] derived the Sasano system from the isomonodromic deformation of the following Fuchsian system:

[formula]

where A0, A1, and At are 4  ×  4 matrices satisfying the following conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus the spectral type of the Fuchsian system ([\ref=eq:Fuchs_sasano]) is 31,22,22,1111. Taking the trace of ([\ref=residue_infty]), we have the Fuchs relation

[formula]

The isomonodromic deformation equation of ([\ref=eq:Fuchs_sasano]) is equivalent to the Hamiltonian system

[formula]

where the Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

We call the Hamiltonian system ([\ref=eq:Ss_system]), ([\ref=eq:Ss_Ham]) the Sasano system. The parametrization of the Fuchsian system ([\ref=eq:Fuchs_sasano]) is rather complicated, see [\cite=KNS] for details.

In the present paper we obtain the following Hamiltoians, which did not appear in [\cite=KNS]. To our knowledge, these systems have not appeared in the literature:

[formula]

Although the Sasano system is a system of ordinary differential equations, there are two systems of partially differential equations [formula] (associated with (1)2(1)2,31,22) and [formula] (associated with (((1)(1)))2,31) in the degeneration scheme in Section [\ref=sec:intro]. This should be interpreted as follows.

For example, the linear system (11)(11),31,22 degenerates to (1)2(1)2,31,22. The former admit one-dimensional deformation, while the latter naturally has two-dimensional deformation. By considering full deformation of the (1)2(1)2,31,22 system, we have the Hamltonians for the degenerate Garnier system of type 3 / 2 + 1 + 1 + 1. The same argument applies to the (((1)(1)))2,31 system. Therefore there are degenerate Garnier systems in two variables in the degeneration scheme.

Laplace transform

In the degeneration scheme of the Sasano system, there are some Hamiltonians which have more than one associated linear systems; that is, [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Linear systems associated with the same Hamiltonian can be transformed into one another by the Laplace transform (and a change of the independent variable if necessary).

The correspondences through the Laplace transform involving only unramified linear systems are given in [\cite=KNS]. In this section we describe the correspondences involving ramified linear systems.

In the case of linear systems of the following form:

[formula]

where B is an m  ×  l matrix and C is an l  ×  m matrix, its Laplace transform is the following ([\cite=B2] [\cite=Hrd]).

[formula]

Through this transformation, we have the following correspondences of spectral types:

[formula]

Note that the symbol ∞   over each spectral type indicates which spectral type (of a singular point) corresponds to the singular point x =   ∞  .

Here the Hamiltonian [formula] is associated with only one linear system in the degeneration scheme of the Sasano system. However it has another linear system which appear as the degeneration of 21,21,111,111. They are related by this transformation.

Similarly, the linear system [formula], which is associated with [formula], corresponds to the system [formula] in the same manner as Section 4.3 in [\cite=KNS] or Section 4 in [\cite=K1]:
