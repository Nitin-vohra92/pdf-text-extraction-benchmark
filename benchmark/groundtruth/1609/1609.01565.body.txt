Pythagorean means and Carnot machines: When music meets heat

Introduction

Mean is an important concept in mathematics and statistics. We will consider the Pythagorean means, defined as follows:

[formula]

which denote the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean, respectively. Here, {xi|i = 1,2,...,n} represents a set of positive, real numbers. Historically, these means are attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagorus, who found their use to represent ratios on a musical scale (see Box 1). There are some common properties satisfied by the means M(x1,...,xn):

(i) [formula]. So, M(x1,...,xn)  =  M(x,...,x) = x.

(ii) A mean is homogeneous function of degree one: M(λx1,...,λxn)  =  λM(x1,...,xn), for all permissible real λ.

(iii) A mean is called symmetric, if it is invariant under permutations of the indices. Thus M(x1,...,xn)  =  M(xσ(1),...,xσ(n)).

Now, for a given set of numbers, when at least two numbers are distinct, there exist elementary inequalities between the means, for example: [formula]. To give commonplace examples of the occurence of Pythagorean means, suppose that you complete two legs of a journey, spending equal time t in each of them, and traveling with average speeds of v1 and v2, then your average speed for the total trip is equal to H(v1,v2). On the other hand, if you cover equal distances in the two legs (e.g. for a return journey), at average speeds of v1 and v2, then the average speed for the total trip would be A(v1,v2). On the other hand, the geometric mean may be seen as the compound average growth rate, [formula], over a principal amount which gets the growth rates of r1 and r2, in the first and the second years, respectively. The inequalities between various means are useful in the proofs of various physical laws. For applications in thermodynamics, see Box 2.

In this paper, we shall observe a natural instance of Pythagorean means in the analysis of coefficients of performance (COP) of ideal thermodynamic machines, in particular, heat engines, refrigerators and heat pumps. It is assumed that we are provided with heat reservoirs at various temperatures representing the set of real, positive numbers over which these means may be defined, and we can run these machines by coupling them to the reservoirs.

Performance measures for Carnot machines

We shall first discuss the case of Pythagorean means for two numbers in the context of heat engines, refrigerators and heat pumps. We start by defining the COPs for these machines.

A heat engine is a device that converts heat into work, as the heat flows from a reservoir at a constant hot temperature Th to one at a cold temperature Tc. The COP for an engine is called its efficiency (E) which is defined as the ratio of the work generated (W) to the heat absorbed (Qh) from the hot reservoir, E  =  W / Qh. For an ideal or reversible heat engine which does not increase entropy of the universe, the efficiency is maximal called Carnot efficiency, which depends only on the ratio of the two temperatures:

[formula]

A refrigerator is a device that helps to cool a system at temperature Tc, by extracting heat from it (Qc) and dumping this heat into a warm environment at Th. Due to the constraint of the second law of thermodynamics, this process cannot proceed spontaneously, and so external work (W) has to be spent to transfer the heat. The COP of refrigerator is defined as R  =  Qc / W, which for an ideal refrigerator is given by

[formula]

A refrigerator with an irreversible operation has a lower COP, implying that it requires a larger amount of work to extract the same amount of heat from the cold system, as compared to the reversible case.

A heat pump also transfers heat from a cold to hot system at the expense of external work, but in this case we are interested to warm the system (such as interiors of a building in winter) by extracting heat from the cold environment. So the COP of a pump is defined as the heat dumped into the warm system (Qh) per unit work expended W for the purpose. Again, for an ideal pump, the COP is given by

[formula]

where Th is the temperature of the interiors, and Tc is the ambient temperature. Note that, by definition, for finite temperatures, 0 < E < 1, R > 0 and P > 1.

Let us now consider another reservoir (warm) with temperature labeled as Ti such that Th  >  Ti  >  Tc. Suppose, we are allowed to run a Carnot engine between reservoirs at Th and Ti, or, between Ti and Tc. The respective efficiencies are : Ehi  =  (Th  -  Ti) / Th and Eic  =  (Ti  -  Tc) / Ti. We can ask: for what value of Ti, we have the situation: Ehi  =  Eic? It follows that at [formula], the two efficiencies are equal. Interestingly, the answer is invariant if we replace both the engines by two Carnot refrigerators or pumps, and require the equality of their respective COPs. In other words, if we set Rhi  =  Ric, or Phi  =  Pic, the solution Ti is equal to the geometric mean temperature of Th and Tc. We address these cases as EE, RR and PP, respectively.

Further, we may consider a refrigerator between Th and Ti, and a pump between Ti and Tc, and require that Rhi  =  Pic. This condition yields, Ti  =  (Th  +  Tc) / 2  =  A(Th,Tc). Conversely, for the situation when Phi  =  Ric, we get Ti  =  H(Th,Tc). The latter cases are addressed as RP and PR, respectively. Thus, we note an interesting instance of Pythagorean means in the context of Carnot machines. These cases are depicted in Fig. 1. See also Table 1.

Generalizations

Consider a set of k heat reservoirs with temperatures ordered as follows:

[formula]

Suppose we run a Carnot engine between a pair of reservoirs, one being a hot reservoir at {Ti|i = 1,2,...,k - 1} and the other being the coldest reservoir within the set, at Tk. The efficiency of a particular engine would be Eik  =  (Ti  -  Tk) / Ti. Then the average efficiency of all these engines may be defined as the arithmetic mean of the individual efficiencies, [formula]. It is easy to verify that

[formula]

where   =  H(T1,T2,...,Tk - 1). Thus one can state this result as:

(a) The arithmetic mean of the efficiencies {Eik} between {Ti} and Tk, where i = 1,2,....,k - 1, is equal to the efficiency of a Carnot engine between [formula] and Tk, where [formula] is harmonic mean of the {Ti}.

We can make similar statements, when the machines in case are refrigerators or pumps, connecting a certain mean COP of the machine, to a certain mean over the hot reservoir temperatures. These statements are given below. The said connection is also shown in Table II.

(b) The harmonic mean of {Rik} between Ti and Tk, where i = 1,2,....,k - 1 is equal to the R-coefficient of a refrigerator between TA and Tk, where TA is the arithmetic mean of {Ti}.

Proof: We can write

[formula]

which can be expressed as:

[formula]

or,

[formula]

where, RH is the harmonic mean of {Rik}, and rhs is the inverse of the R-coefficient (RAk) between TA and Tk.

(c) The harmonic mean of {Pik} between {Ti} and Tk, where i = 1,2,....,k - 1, is equal to the P-coefficient of a heat pump between TH and Tk, where TH is the harmonic mean of {Ti}.

Alternately, we can assume individual operations of the machines between the hottest reservoir T1 and each of the lower-temperature reservoirs. Then we can formulate statements, equivalent to the above and summarized below, that connect the means over the COPs to certain means over the lower temperatures.

(a') The arithmetic mean of efficiencies {E1i} between T1 and {Ti}, where i = 2,....,k is equal to the efficiency of an engine between T1 and the arithmetic mean of {Ti}.

(b') The harmonic mean of {R1i} between T1 and {Ti}, where i = 2,....,k, is equal to the R-coefficient of a refrigerator between T1 and the harmonic mean of {Ti}.

(c') The harmonic mean of {P1i} between T1 and {Ti}, where i = 2,....,k, is equal to the P-coefficient of a pump between T1 and the arithmetic mean of {Ti}s.

Now consider that for the ordered set of temperatures, we are given the probability distribution {pi}, to connect two temperatures Ti and Tk by a Carnot machine, say, a heat engine. Then we have :

[formula]

Here, [formula] defines the weighted harmonic mean of Tis. Then the statement (a) in the above, is generalized as follows:

For a given probability distribution {pi}, the weighted arithmetic mean of the efficiencies {Eik} between Ti and Tk, is equal to the efficiency of an engine between [formula] and Tk, where [formula] is weighted harmonic mean of the {Ti}, i = 1,2,....,k - 1.

Similar generalized statements, based on the weighted means, can be made for the other cases mentioned above.

Finally, we consider an ordered set of n positive, real numbers (temperatures):

[formula]

We ask, under what condition, a temperature, say Tk, is one of the Pythagorean means? The solution generalizes the two-temperatures case, as discussed in Section II. So, if Tk is the arithmetic mean of the rest of the values within the set, i.e. Tk  =  A(T1,T2,...Tk - 1,Tk + 1,...,Tn), then the following relation can be written:

[formula]

In other words, the R coefficient enters in the above, for temperatures above Tk and the P coefficient, for temperatures below Tk.

Now from the definition of the harmonic mean, we have:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where PH is the harmonic mean of {Pki}. Using Eqs. ([\ref=rh]) and ([\ref=ph]) in ([\ref=nam]), we get

[formula]

It implies that the ratio of effective R- to P- coefficients which appear as harmonic means, is the ratio of whole numbers. This result is somewhat reminiscent of the original observation of Pythagorus about the ratios of means, expressible as ratios of whole numbers.

Similarly, we can consider the occurence of other means within the given set of real, positive numbers. It is left as an exercise for the reader that if Tk  =  H(T1,T2,...Tk - 1,Tk + 1,...,Tn), then the following condition is satisfied:

[formula]

Finally, if Tk  =  G(T1,T2,...Tk - 1,Tk + 1,...,Tn), for some given k, then we can have three situations for a pair of temperatures (Ti,Tk), with i  ≠  k: all E coefficients, all R coefficients, or all P coefficients. Then it can be shown that

[formula]

Summary

Concluding, we have highlighted a few instances where the Pythagorean means arise naturally in the discussion of coefficients of performance for Carnot machines working between hot and cold reservoirs. In comparing the COPs of a machine between Th and Ti, and of a machine between Ti and Tc, we have considered scenarios like EE,RR,PP,RP, and PR. So far, we did not consider an engine along with a refrigerator or a pump. The intuition behind this was to compare the performance of similar machines. Thus while a refrigerator or a heat pump drives heat from cold to hot, in a heat engine the heat flow is in opposite direction. Further, it is not possible to consider a case like EP, because while E < 1, we have P > 1, and so their COPs cannot become equal. But scenario like ER or RE are possible. It can be shown that the equality of respective COPs in these cases, is possible only if the condition [formula] holds. Then it leads to a different kind of symmetric mean, and not to a Pythagorean mean.

We also considered various physical situations involving more than one reservoirs (Ti) that can be coupled via a Carnot machine to a given reservoir (Tk), and the mean COP has been related to the effective COP evaluated from the mean temperature and Tk. The relations pointed out in this paper and the known inequalities between Pythagorean means may be useful to fix bounds on performance of thermal machines in such physical situations. For instance, consider the fact that the harmonic mean is dominated by the lowest number: H({Rik})  ≤  (k - 1)Min({Rik}). From the definition, Rik  =  Tk  /  (Ti  -  Tk), we have Min({Rik})  =  R1k, since T1 is the largest entry. Then from Eq. ([\ref=rh]), we get the upper bound for the effective COP, RAk  ≤  (k - 1)R1k.
