On semitopological interassociates of the bicyclic monoid

We shall follow the terminology of [\cite=Carruth-Hildebrant-Koch-1983-1986] [\cite=Clifford-Preston-1961-1967] [\cite=Engelking-1989] [\cite=Ruppert-1984]. By N and [formula] we denote the sets of non-negative integers and positive integers, respectively. If A is a subset of a topological space X then by [formula] and [formula] we denote the topological closure and interior of A in X, respectively.

A semigroup is a non-empty set with a binary associative operation.

The bicyclic semigroup (or the bicyclic monoid) [formula] is the semigroup with the identity 1 generated by two elements p and q subjected only to the condition pq = 1. The bicyclic monoid [formula] is a combinatorial bisimple F-inverse semigroup (see [\cite=Lawson-1998]) and it plays an important role in the algebraic theory of semigroups and in the theory of topological semigroups. For example the well-known O. Andersen's result [\cite=Andersen-1952] states that a (0-)simple semigroup is completely (0-)simple if and only if it does not contain the bicyclic semigroup. The bicyclic semigroup does not embed into stable semigroups [\cite=Koch-Wallace-1957].

An interassociate of a semigroup (S,  ·  ) is a semigroup [formula] such that for all a,b,c∈S, [formula] and [formula]. This definition of interassociativity was studied extensively in 1996 by Boyd et al [\cite=Boyd-Gould-Nelson-1998]. Certain classes of semigroups are known to give rise to interassociates with various properties. For example, it is very easy to show that if S is a monoid, every interassociate must satisfy the condition [formula] for some fixed element c∈S (see [\cite=Boyd-Gould-Nelson-1998]). This type of interassociate was called a variant by Hickey [\cite=Hickey-1983]. In addition, every interassociate of a completely simple semigroup is completely simple [\cite=Boyd-Gould-Nelson-1998]. Finally, it is relatively easy to show that every interassociate of a group is isomorphic to that group.

In the paper [\cite=Givens-Rosin-Linton-2016??] the bicyclic semigroup [formula] and its interassociates are investigated. In particular, if p and q are the generators of the bicyclic semigroup [formula] and m and n are fixed nonnegative integers, the operation [formula] is known to be an interassociate. There was shown that for distinct pairs (m,n) and (s,t), the interassociates [formula] and [formula] are not isomorphic. Also in [\cite=Givens-Rosin-Linton-2016??] the authors generalized a result regarding homomorphisms on [formula] to homomorphisms on its interassociates.

Later for fixed non-negative integers m and n the interassociate [formula] of the bicyclic monoid [formula] we shall denote by [formula].

A (semi)topological semigroup is a topological space with a (separately) continuous semigroup operation.

The bicyclic semigroup admits only the discrete semigroup topology and if a topological semigroup S contains it as a dense subsemigroup then [formula] is an open subset of S [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969]. Bertman and West in [\cite=Bertman-West-1976] extend this result for the case of Hausdorff semitopological semigroups. Stable and Γ-compact topological semigroups do not contain the bicyclic semigroup [\cite=Anderson-Hunter-Koch-1965] [\cite=Hildebrant-Koch-1986]. The problem of an embedding of the bicyclic monoid into compact-like topological semigroups studied in [\cite=Banakh-Dimitrova-Gutik-2009] [\cite=Banakh-Dimitrova-Gutik-2010] [\cite=Gutik-Repovs-2007]. Also in the paper [\cite=Fihel-Gutik-2011] proved that the discrete topology is the unique topology on the extended bicyclic semigroup [formula] such that the semigroup operation on [formula] is separately continuous. Amazing dichotomy for the bicyclic monoid with adjoined zero [formula] was proved in [\cite=Gutik-2015]: every Hausdorff locally compact semitopological bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero [formula] is either compact or discrete.

In this paper we study semitopological interassociates [formula] of the bicyclic monoid [formula] for arbitrary non-negative integers m and m. Some results from [\cite=Bertman-West-1976] [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969] [\cite=Gutik-2015] obtained for the bicyclic semigroup are extended to its interassociate [formula]. In particular we show that for arbitrary non-negative integers m, n every Hausdorff topology τ on [formula] such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup, is discrete and hence [formula] is a discrete subspace of any semitopological semigroup containing it. Also, we prove that if [formula] is any interassociate of the bicyclic monoid such that [formula] is a dense subsemigroup of a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup (S,  ·  ) and [formula] then I is a two-sided ideal of the semigroup S and show that for arbitrary non-negative integers m and n any Hausdorff locally compact topology τ on the interassociate [formula] with an adjoined zero 0 of the bicyclic monoid [formula] such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup, is either discrete or compact.

For arbitrary i,j∈N we denote The semigroup operation [formula] of [formula] implies that [formula] is a subsemigroup of [formula].

We need the following trivial lemma.

For arbitrary non-negative integers m and n the subsemigroup [formula] of [formula] is isomorphic to the bicyclic semigroup [formula] under the map [formula], i,j∈N.

It is sufficient to show that so defined above map [formula] is a homomorphism, because ι is bijective. Then for arbitrary i,j,k,l∈N we have that and which completes the proof of the lemma.

Lemma I.1 from [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969] and the definition of the semigroup operation in [formula] imply the following:

For arbitrary non-negative integers m and n and for each elements [formula] the both sets are finite; that is, left translation by a and right translation by a are finite-to-one maps.

The following theorem generalises the Eberhart-Selden result about semigroup topologization of the bicyclic semigroup (see [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969]) and corresponding statement for the case semitopological semigroups in [\cite=Bertman-West-1976].

For arbitrary non-negative integers m, n and every Hausdorff topology τ on [formula] such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup, is discrete. Thus [formula] is a discrete subspace of any topological semigroup containing it.

By Proposition 1 of [\cite=Bertman-West-1976] every Hausdorff topology [formula] on the bicyclic semigroup [formula] such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup, is discrete. Hence Lemma [\ref=lemma-1] implies that for any element [formula] there exists an open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in [formula] such that [formula]. Fix an arbitrary open neighbourhood U(qnpm) of the point qnpm in [formula] such that [formula]. Then the separate continuity of the semigroup operation in [formula] implies that there exists an open neighbourhood V(qnpm)  ⊆  U(qnpm) of the point qnpm in the space [formula] such that Suppose to the contrary that the neighbourhood V(qnpm) is an infinite set. Then at least one of the following conditions holds:

there exists a non-negative integer i0 < n such that the set [formula] is infinite;

there exists a non-negative integer j0 < m such that the set [formula] is infinite.

In case (i) for arbitrary qi0pl∈A we have that and similar in case (ii) we obtain that for each qlpj0∈B, which contradicts the separate continuity of the semigroup operation in [formula]. The obtained contradiction implies that qnpm is an isolated point in the space [formula].

Now, since the semigroup [formula] is simple (see [\cite=Givens-Rosin-Linton-2016??]) Lemma [\ref=lemma-2] implies that the topology τ on [formula] is discrete.

If m and n are arbitrary non-negative integers, the interassociate [formula] of the bicyclic monoid [formula] is a dense subsemigroup of a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup (S,  ·  ) and [formula] then I is a two-sided ideal of the semigroup S.

Fix an arbitrary element y∈I. If x  ·  y = z∉I for some [formula] then there exists an open neighbourhood U(y) of the point y in the space S such that [formula]. The neighbourhood U(y) contains infinitely many elements of the semigroup [formula] which contradicts Lemma [\ref=lemma-2]. The obtained contradiction implies that x  ·  y∈I for all [formula] and y∈I. The proof of the statement that y  ·  x∈I for all [formula] and y∈I is similar.

Suppose to the contrary that x  ·  y = w∉I for some x,y∈I. Then [formula] and the separate continuity of the semigroup operation in S implies that there exist open neighbourhoods U(x) and U(y) of the points x and y in S, respectively, such that {x}  ·  U(y) = {w} and U(x)  ·  {y}  =  {w}. Since both neighbourhoods U(x) and U(y) contain infinitely many elements of the semigroup [formula], both equalities {x}  ·  U(y) = {w} and U(x)  ·  {y}  =  {w} contradict mentioned above Lemma [\ref=lemma-2]. The obtained contradiction implies that x  ·  y∈I.

We recall that a topological space X is said to be:

compact if every open cover of X contains a finite subcover;

countably compact if each closed discrete subspace of X is finite;

feebly compact if each locally finite open cover of X is finite;

pseudocompact if X is Tychonoff and each continuous real-valued function on X is bounded;

locally compact if every point x of X has an open neighbourhood U(x) with the compact closure [formula];

ech-complete if X is Tychonoff and there exists a compactification cX of X such that the remainder of X is an Fσ-set in cX.

According to Theorem 3.10.22 of [\cite=Engelking-1989], a Tychonoff topological space X is feebly compact if and only if X is pseudocompact. Also, a Hausdorff topological space X is feebly compact if and only if every locally finite family of non-empty open subsets of X is finite. Every compact space and every sequentially compact space are countably compact, every countably compact space is feebly compact (see [\cite=Arkhangelskii-1992]).

A topological semigroup S is called Γ-compact if for every x∈S the closure of the set [formula] is a compactum in S (see [\cite=Hildebrant-Koch-1986]). Since by Lemma [\ref=lemma-1] the semigroup [formula] contains the bicyclic semigroup as a subsemigroup the results obtained in [\cite=Anderson-Hunter-Koch-1965], [\cite=Banakh-Dimitrova-Gutik-2009], [\cite=Banakh-Dimitrova-Gutik-2010], [\cite=Gutik-Repovs-2007], [\cite=Hildebrant-Koch-1986] imply the following corollary

Let m and n be arbitrary non-negative integers. If a Hausdorff topological semigroup S satisfies one of the following conditions:

S is compact;

S is Γ-compact;

the square S  ×  S is countably compact; or

the square S  ×  S is a Tychonoff pseudocompact space,

then S does not contain the semigroup [formula].

Let m and n be arbitrary non-negative integers. Let S be a Hausdorff topological semigroup which contains a dense subsemigroup [formula]. Then for every [formula] the set is an open-and-closed subset of S  ×  S.

By Theorem [\ref=theorem-3], [formula] is a discrete subspace of S and hence we have that Dc(A) is an open subset of S  ×  S.

Suppose that there exists [formula] such that Dc(A) is a non-closed subset of S  ×  S. Then there exists an accumulation point (a,b)∈S  ×  S of the set Dc(A). The continuity of the semigroup operation in S implies that a  ·  b = c. But [formula] is a discrete subspace of S  ×  S and hence by Theorem [\ref=theorem-4] the points a and b belong to the two-sided ideal [formula] and hence [formula] cannot be equal to the element c.

Let m and n be arbitrary non-negative integers. If a Hausdorff topological semigroup S contains [formula] as a dense subsemigroup then the square S  ×  S is not feebly compact.

Since the square S  ×  S contains an infinite open-and-closed discrete subspace Dc(A), we conclude that S  ×  S fails to be feebly compact (see [\cite=Engelking-1989] or [\cite=Colmez-1951]).

The following proposition generalizes Theorem I.3 from [\cite=Eberhart-Selden-1969].

For arbitrary non-positive integers m and m by [formula] we denote the interassociate [formula] with an adjoined zero 0 of the bicyclic monoid [formula], i.e., [formula].

On the semigroup [formula] we define a topology [formula] in the following way:

every element of the semigroup [formula] is an isolated point in the space [formula];

the family [formula] determines a base of the topology [formula] at zero [formula],

i.e., [formula] is the topology of the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the discrete space [formula] with the remainder {0}. The semigroup operation in [formula] is separately continuous, because all elements of the interassociate [formula] of the bicyclic semigroup [formula] are isolated points in the space [formula] and left and right translations in the semigroup [formula] are finite-to-one maps (see Lemma [\ref=lemma-2]).

By Theorem [\ref=theorem-3] the discrete topology [formula] is a unique Hausdorff topology on the interassociate [formula] of the bicyclic monoid [formula], m,n∈N, such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup. So [formula] is the unique compact topology on [formula] such that [formula] is a Hausdorff compact semitopological semigroup for any non-negative integers m and n.

The following theorem generalized Theorem 1 from [\cite=Gutik-2015].

Let m and n be arbitrary non-negative integers. If [formula] is a Hausdorff locally compact semitopological semigroup, then either [formula] is discrete or [formula] is topologically isomorphic to [formula].

Fix an arbitrary Hausdorff locally compact topology τ on [formula] such that [formula] is a semitopological semigroup and the zero 0 of [formula] is not an isolated point of the space [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma-1] the subsemigroup [formula] of [formula] is isomorphic to the bicyclic semigroup [formula] and hence the subsemigroup [formula] of [formula] is isomorphic to the bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero [formula]. Then Theorem [\ref=theorem-3] implies that [formula] is a dense discrete subspace of [formula], and hence by Corollary 3.3.10 of [\cite=Engelking-1989] the subspace [formula] of [formula] is locally compact. Now by Theorem 1 from [\cite=Gutik-2015] we obtain that [formula] is compact. Then for every open neighbourhood U(0) of the zero 0 in [formula] we have that the set [formula] is finite. The semigroup operation of [formula] implies that the set [formula] is finite, and hence the above arguments imply that every open neighbourhood U(0) of the zero 0 in [formula] has a finite complement in the space [formula]. Thus the space [formula] is compact and by Remark [\ref=remark-8] the semitopological semigroup [formula] is topologically isomorphic to [formula].

Since by Corollary [\ref=corollary-5] the interassociate [formula] of the bicyclic monoid [formula] does not embeds into any Hausdorff compact topological semigroup, Theorem [\ref=theorem-8] implies the following corollary.

If m and n are arbitrary non-negative integers and [formula] is a Hausdorff locally compact topological semigroup, then [formula] is discrete.

The following example shows that a counterpart of the statement of Corollary [\ref=corollary-9] does not hold when [formula] is a ech-complete metrizable topological semigroup for any non-negative integers m and n.

Fix an arbitrary non-negative integers m and n. On the semigroup [formula] we define a topology [formula] in the following way:

every element of the interassociate [formula] of the bicyclic monoid is an isolated point in the space [formula];

the family [formula], where determines a base of the topology [formula] at zero [formula].

It is obvious that [formula] is first countable space. Then the definition of the semigroup operation of [formula] and the arguments presented in [\cite=Gutik-1996] show that [formula] is a Hausdorff topological semigroup.

First we observe that each element of the family [formula] is an open-and-closed subset of [formula], and hence the space [formula] is regular. Since the set [formula] is countable, the definition of the topology [formula] implies that [formula] is second countable, and hence by Theorem 4.2.9 from [\cite=Engelking-1989] the space [formula] is metrizable. Also, it is obvious that the space [formula] is ech-complete, as a union two ech-complete spaces: that are the discrete space [formula] and the singleton space {0}.

Also the following example shows that a counterpart of the statement of Theorem [\ref=theorem-8] (and hence of Corollary [\ref=corollary-9]) does not hold for any interassociate of the bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero [formula].

It is obvious that the interassociate of the bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero [formula] with the following operation [formula] is isomorphic to an arbitrary infinite countable semigroup with zero-multiplication, i.e., it is zero semigroup. It is well known that zero semigroup with any topology is a topology is a topological semigroup (see [\cite=Carruth-Hildebrant-Koch-1983-1986]).

Later we need the following notions. A continuous map f:X  →  Y from a topological space X into a topological space Y is called:

quotient if the set f- 1(U) is open in X if and only if U is open in Y (see [\cite=Moore-1925] and [\cite=Engelking-1989]);

hereditarily quotient or pseudoopen if for every B  ⊂  Y the restriction f|B:f- 1(B)  →  B of f is a quotient map (see [\cite=McDougle-1958] [\cite=McDougle-1959] [\cite=Arkhangelskii-1963] and [\cite=Engelking-1989]);

closed if f(F) is closed in Y for every closed subset F in X;

perfect if X is Hausdorff, f is a closed map and all fibers f- 1(y) are compact subsets of X [\cite=Vainstein-1947].

Every closed map and every hereditarily quotient map are quotient [\cite=Engelking-1989]. Moreover, a continuous map f:X  →  Y from a topological space X onto a topological space Y is hereditarily quotient if and only if for every y∈Y and every open subset U in X which contains f- 1(y) we have that [formula] (see [\cite=Engelking-1989]).

Later we need the following trivial lemma, which follows from separate continuity of the semigroup operation in semitopological semigroups.

Let S be a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup and I be a compact ideal in S. Then the Rees-quotient semigroup S / I with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup.

The following theorem generalized Theorem 2 from [\cite=Gutik-2015].

Let [formula] be a Hausdorff locally compact semitopological semigroup, [formula] and I is a compact ideal of [formula]. Then either [formula] is a compact semitopological semigroup or the ideal I is open.

Suppose that I is not open. By Lemma [\ref=lemma-11] the Rees-quotient semigroup [formula] with the quotient topology [formula] is a semitopological semigroup. Let [formula] be the natural homomorphism which is a quotient map. It is obvious that the Rees-quotient semigroup [formula] is isomorphic to the semigroup [formula] and the image π(I) is zero of [formula]. Now we shall show that the natural homomorphism [formula] is a hereditarily quotient map. Since [formula] is a discrete subspace of [formula], it is sufficient to show that for every open neighbourhood U(I) of the ideal I in the space [formula] we have that the image π(U(I)) is an open neighbourhood of the zero 0 in the space [formula]. Indeed, [formula] is an open-and-closed subset of [formula], because the elements of the semigroup [formula] are isolated points of the space [formula]. Also, since the restriction [formula] of the natural homomorphism [formula] is one-to-one, [formula] is an open-and-closed subset of [formula]. So π(U(I)) is an open neighbourhood of the zero 0 of the semigroup [formula], and hence the natural homomorphism [formula] is a hereditarily quotient map. Since I is a compact ideal of the semitopological semigroup [formula], π- 1(y) is a compact subset of [formula] for every [formula]. By Din' N'e T'ong's Theorem (see [\cite=Din'-N'e-T'ong-1963] or [\cite=Engelking-1989]), [formula] is a Hausdorff locally compact space. If I is not open then by Theorem [\ref=theorem-8] the semitopological semigroup [formula] is topologically isomorphic to [formula] and hence it is compact. Next we shall prove that the space [formula] is compact. Let [formula] be an arbitrary open cover of the topological space [formula]. Since I is compact, there exist [formula] such that [formula]. Put [formula]. Then [formula] is a closed-and-open subset of [formula]. Also, since the restriction [formula] of the natural homomorphism [formula] is one-to-one, [formula] is an open-and-closed subset of [formula], and hence the image [formula] is finite, because the semigroup [formula] is compact. Thus, the set [formula] is finite and hence the space [formula] is compact as well.

If [formula] is a Hausdorff locally compact topological semigroup, [formula] and I is a compact ideal of [formula], then the ideal I is open.
