Detecting Chiral Magnetic Effect by Lattice Dynamics

Introduction.

Weyl semimetal (WSM) [\cite=Weyl_1929] [\cite=nielsen_adler-bell-jackiw_1983] [\cite=volovik_universe_2003] [\cite=murakami_phase_2007] [\cite=wan_topological_2011] [\cite=burkov_weyl_2011] is a special type of metallic phase, which contains Weyl points (WPs), the crossing points of two non-degenerate bands, in its band structure near the Fermi level. The uniqueness of WSM lies in two different aspects, the appearance of unclosed Fermi surfaces for the surface states, Fermi arcs [\cite=wan_topological_2011] [\cite=weng_weyl_2015] [\cite=huang_weyl_2015] [\cite=potter_quantum_2014] [\cite=lv_observation_2015] [\cite=lv_observation_spin_2015] [\cite=xu_discovery_2015] [\cite=xu_discovery_2015-1]; and the abnormal response under the external fields, which can be summarised as chiral magnetic effect (CME) [\cite=fukushima_chiral_2008] [\cite=son_berry_2012] [\cite=zyuzin_topological_2012] [\cite=chen_axion_2013] [\cite=vazifeh_electromagnetic_2013] and anomalous Hall effect [\cite=fang_anomalous_2003] [\cite=xiao_berry_2010] [\cite=yang_quantum_2011]. Compared to anomalous Hall effect, the CME only occurs in WSM and attracts lots of research interests in recent years.

The origin of CME can be understood from the basic electromagnetic (EM) response of a single WP. Under the external magnetic field, the low energy states around a single WP carry a finite current along the field direction due to the chirality of the zeroth landau band [\cite=nielsen_adler-bell-jackiw_1983]. It is clear that the net CME current under a static magnetic field must be zero for any equilibrium states, which can be guaranteed by the cancellation of the contributions from different WPs with opposite chiralities, and the CME can only manifest itself in the non-equilibrium states driven by the external fields [\cite=vazifeh_electromagnetic_2013] [\cite=chen_axion_2013]. For instance, the external electric field parallel to the magnetic field will pump the electrons between WPs with opposite chiralities, which is known as chiral anomaly [\cite=nielsen_adler-bell-jackiw_1983] [\cite=stephanov_chiral_2012] [\cite=son_berry_2012], leading to particle imbalance and hence a non-zero net CME current. In the DC limit, such electron pumping will be eventually balanced by inter-valley scattering process caused by impurities. And the CME/chiral anomaly leads to negative magneto-resistance along the magnetic field direction, which has been studied intensively in recent years [\cite=son_chiral_2013] [\cite=kim_boltzmann_2014] [\cite=burkov_chiral_2014] [\cite=burkov_negative_2015] [\cite=kim_dirac_2013] [\cite=huang_observation_2015] [\cite=xiong_evidence_2015] [\cite=zhang_signatures_2016] [\cite=li_giant_2015] [\cite=li_negative_2016]. In the present Letter, however, we will focus on the CME in the AC limit, which will cause exotic coupling between some specific phonon mode and the CME current under the magnetic field. As will be explained in details in the following, such abnormal coupling will cause a dramatic change in the optical properties, i.e. the reflectivity, which can be detected by optical measurement directly.

The pseudo scalar phonon.

According to CME, a current proportional to the magnetic field can be generated by the imbalanced chemical potentials between the WPs with opposite chiralities. The simplest way to understand CME is to consider a multi-Weyl system with different chemical potentials for each WPs, where the chiral current can be expressed as [\cite=son_berry_2012]:

[formula]

In the above equation, [formula], χi and μi denote the position, chirality and chemical potential of the i-th WP, respectively. Eq. ([\ref=eq:j_CME]) can be illustrated through a simplest model containing only two WPs shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:Q-CME]). Under the external magnetic field, the low energy electronic states near the WPs become one dimensional Landau bands, which can only disperse along the field direction as shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:Q-CME]). Since the imbalance of the chemical potentials only occurs between different valleys, it is apparent that only the zeroth Landau band contributes to the the chiral current, which can be written as:

[formula]

where [formula] is the wavevector along [formula], [formula] is the degeneracy of each Landau level state and [formula] integrates over all the occupied states.

It is well known that the imbalanced chemical potentials can be induced by chiral anomaly effect [\cite=nielsen_adler-bell-jackiw_1983] [\cite=stephanov_chiral_2012] [\cite=son_berry_2012], which pumps electrons between WPs with opposite chiralities. In the present Letter, we propose that, besides chiral anomaly, such imbalanced chemical potentials and hence the chiral current can also be induced by the deformation potentials associated with some optical phonon modes. Since the generic WSM contains multiple pairs of WPs, it is important to know that for a given phonon mode the contributions from different pairs of WPs will cancel each other or not, which is fully determined by the crystal symmetry. In the main text we will mostly focus on the conclusions of such group theory analysis and leave the mathematical proof in the supplementary [\cite=supp]. For the sake of simplicity, in the current study we only consider the non-degenerate optical phonon modes in the long wavelength limit, which form one dimensional representations of the little group at the Γ point. To the leading order, the electron-phonon coupling for a specific phonon mode can be expressed as:

[formula]

which describes the energy shifts of the WPs by the deformation potential owing to the phonon mode Q. The summation over [formula] only concerns the low energy states around each WP. In the present Letter, we consider the AC limit and together with the clean limit, where the relaxation rate due to the impurity scattering is much less than the typical phonon or plasmon frequency. Therefore, for simplicity we neglect the impurity scattering and only consider the dynamical effect. Consider that the system deforms from Q = 0 (Fig. ([\ref=fig:Q-CME]) (a)) to [formula] (Fig. ([\ref=fig:Q-CME]) (b)). Since the carrier relaxation is neglected here, the occupation of the Landau bands does not follow the change of the Hamiltonian, leading to the imbalanced chemical potential [formula]. Then according to Eq. ([\ref=eq:j_CME]), the CME current induced by the deformation potential caused by the phonon mode Q can be obtained as:

[formula]

where [formula] and NW is the number of WPs.

A phone mode Q can couple to the CME current only if Δa,Q does not vanish, which sets the constrain for the allowed phonon modes. From the symmetry point of view, all the WSM materials can be divided into two classes by whether or not their space groups contain improper rotations, such as the inversion or mirror operators. As proved rigorously in the supplementary, if the space group does not contain any improper rotations, the symmetry allowed phonon modes are those A1 modes, which behave as scalars under the little group at Γ point. Up to now most of the WSM materials do have improper rotations in the space groups and thus belong to the latter class. In this class, the phonon modes that couple to CME must behave as pseudo scalars under the point group transformations. In other words, these phonon modes must keep identity under all the proper rotations and change signs under all the improper rotations. Such phonon modes are called pseudo scalar phonons in this Letter, which can be either polarised or unpolarised. Apparently, if a pseudo scalar mode is polarised its polarisation vector must be parallel (perpendicular) to any symmetry axes (mirrors) of the point group. As a result, as long as there are two or more non-parallel axes or mirror normals Q can not be polarised. The above conclusions can be easily derived from the invariance of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:Hep]) under all the point group transformations, which is described in details in the supplementary [\cite=supp]. We apply this criterion to some Dirac semimetals and WSMs studied recently in the literature and find that in [formula] [\cite=xu_chern_2011], [formula] [\cite=wang_three-dimensional_2013] and [formula] [\cite=gibson_three-dimensional_2015] the symmetry allowed phonon modes do exist [\cite=supp]. In the following, we will illustrate how the coupling between the pseudo scalar phonon and the CME affects the lattice dynamics and hence manifests itself in the optical response.

Equations of motion (EOMs)

From Eq. ([\ref=eq:j_CME_Q]), we can find that in WSM a current along the external magnetic field [formula] can be induced by the motion of the pseudo scalar phonon mode. Such a CME current will generate charge accumulation at the sample boundaries and cause an internal electric field [formula], which leads to inter-valley electron pumping under the magnetic field [formula] due to the chiral anomaly. Therefore in such a system, the EOMs for pseudo scalar phonon mode Q, chiral charge density defined as [formula] (Fig. ([\ref=fig:Q-CME]) (b)), as well as the electric field [formula] are all coupled together, leading to quite unusual EM responses in WSM. In the present Letter, we will mainly focus on the EOMs for the unpolarised phonon mode and briefly discuss the possible effects related to the polarised phonon modes thereafter. Tracing out the electronic degrees of freedom in Eq. ([\ref=eq:Hep]), we obtain the effective Lagrangian density for the phonon as:

[formula]

where Mph is the effective mass, ωph is the phonon frequency and Ω is the unit cell volume. Then the EOM of Q can be obtained as:

[formula]

On the other hand, according to Ref. [\cite=stephanov_chiral_2012] [\cite=son_berry_2012] the low energy electronic dynamics near the WPs leads to the chiral anomaly, the electron pumping between WPs with opposite chiralities, which can be expressed as:

[formula]

Next we consider the EOM for the EM wave propagating in the WSM, which can be written as

[formula]

In WSM [formula] can be simply set as [formula] where κ is dielectric constant in the high frequency limit. While the current [formula] contains multiple terms with different origins, which can be written as [formula]. The first two terms are the optical current [formula] (where i distinguishes the transversal and longitudinal responses) and the Hall current [formula], which exist in all metallic systems. In addition, there are two novel components in a WSM, the CME and anomalous Hall currents. In the clean limit, the imbalanced chiral charges ([\ref=eq:EOM-na]) have little chance to be scattered from the zeroth Landau bands to the other Landau bands, because the scattering rate is much less than the corresponding frequency. Thus the imbalance of the "chemical potentials", or the highest occupied energies, of the zeroth Landau bands can be written as Δμ0 = NWΔaQ + na  /  νD, where [formula] is the density of states of a single zeroth Landau band. The two terms contained in Δμ0 describe the pseudo scalar phonon contribution and chiral anomaly contribution, respectively. Thus the total CME current is explicitly written as:

[formula]

The anomalous Hall current can be expressed as [formula], where [formula] is the integral of the Berry curvature contributed by all the occupied bands over the Brillouin zone. Including all the four different origins of the current in Eq. ([\ref=eq:EOM-EM]), we obtain the coupled equations ([\ref=eq:EOM-Q-np]), ([\ref=eq:EOM-na]) and ([\ref=eq:EOM-EM]) for the pseudo scalar phonon mode Q, chiral charge density na, and the electric field [formula], which can be solved under different conditions leading to several novel optical properties introduced below.

Physical consequences.

The above EOMs give a new mechanism to couple the EM wave with the pseudo scalar phonons through CME, which only exists under the external magnetic field. If the particular pseudo scalar phonon mode is polarised, the additional coupling caused by CME only modifies the coupling constant between the two. While if the pseudo scalar phonon mode is unpolarised, it can now couple to the EM wave by the CME, which will generate a dramatic change in the optical response near the phonon frequency. In other words, the originally optical inactive phonon mode can become active under the external magnetic field due to the CME. In this present Letter, we will mainly focus on the unpolarised phonon modes and only briefly discuss the polarised phonon modes thereafter, because the effect in the former case is more dramatic. To avoid additional contributions from both ordinary and anomalous Hall effects, we always set the external magnetic field [formula] to be parallel to the vector [formula] (if there is a nonzero [formula]) and consider the polarisation of the EM mode to be along the magnetic field. In total there are two EM modes, which are free from Hall effects and will be studied in detail below.

The first one is the transverse mode describing an EM wave with wavevector [formula] being perpendicular and polarisation direction being parallel to the magnetic field [formula], as shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-trans]) (a). The EOM for the electric field in such situation can be simplified as

[formula]

where σT denotes the transverse optical conductivity [\cite=ashby_chiral_2014]. The effective dielectric function in this case can be obtained by substituting the solution of Eq. ([\ref=eq:EOM-Q-np]) and ([\ref=eq:EOM-na]) into Eq. ([\ref=eq:EOM-EM-trans]), which can be written as

[formula]

where ε0r,T is the original dielectric function without magnetic field. The above solution indicates that through CME the photon with the polarisation along the field direction can hybridize with the unpolarised pseudo scalar phonon to form a special type of polariton mode, which can only exist under the magnetic field. If the phonon frequency ωph is higher than the plasmon frequency ωpl, as shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-trans]) (b), without the magnetic field there is a level crossing between ET1 and Q at frequency ωph and momentum [formula], which becomes anti-crossing under the magnetic field through the CME. By solving the equation [formula] to the first order of [formula] and Δa, we can get the hybridization gap between the photon like and phonon like branches to be

[formula]

The existence of such CME induced polariton mode can be inferred from the dramatic modification of the reflectivity under the magnetic field, which can be written as [formula] [\cite=ashcroft_solid_1976]. For example, as ω approaches ωph the last term in Eq. ([\ref=eq:eps_r_trans]) will diverge, leading to an additional peak in the reflectivity.

We further apply numerical calculations for the CME induced polariton modes using the typical parameters for the semiconductor or semimetal materials, which are NW = 4, [formula], κ = 15, [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. The Fermi momentum has been chosen as [formula]. The dispersion of the polariton modes and the reflectivity of light are calculated and shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-trans]). A CME induced hybridization gap between the phonon and photon-like branches can be found clearly under the magnetic field , as shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-trans]) (d), which generates an additional peak in the optical reflectivity after the plasmon edge, as illustrated in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-trans]) (e).

The second EM mode, that is free from the Hall effects, is the longitudinal or plasmonic mode [\cite=panfilov_density_2014] with wavevector and polarisation direction both being parallel to the magnetic field. The EOM can then be simplified to

[formula]

where σL denotes the longitudinal conductivity. The effective dielectric function for EL is similar with Eq. ([\ref=eq:eps_r_trans]) except that σT is replaced by σL. Similar to the polariton case, the CME will generate coupling between the unpolarised pseudo scalar phonon and the plasmon modes, which are otherwise completely decoupled without the CME. Similarly we can obtain the hybridization gap between the two branches as

[formula]

where ε0r,L is the original longitudinal dielectric function without magnetic field [\cite=lv_dielectric_2013]. The similar numerical calculations for the coupled plasmon and phonon modes have been carried out using the same parameters introduced above and the results are shown in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-long]), where the hybridization between the plasmon and phonon modes can be induced only with the finite magnetic field. Such mixed modes under magnetic field can be detected by the Raman scattering with the proper setup.

In the end, we briefly discuss the situation for the polarised pseudo scalar phonon modes. We list the four different configurations in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) as examples and always set as [formula] if there is a nonzero [formula]. In Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) (a), the phonon mode couples to the EM mode ET1 because their polarisation directions are parallel to each other. The CME enhances such coupling and modifies the dispersion of the polariton modes in this case. The situation in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) (b) is more complicated. The two transverse EM modes, the longitudinal plasmon mode and the pseudo scalar phonon mode are all coupled together under the magnetic field due to the combination of the Hall effect and CME. The case in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) (c) is similar with the case in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) (a), in which the CME enhances the coupling strength between Q and EL. The case in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) (d) is as complicated as the case in Fig. ([\ref=fig:EM-pol]) (b) because all the modes are coupled together.

Conclusions.

In summary, a special type of phonon mode, which behaves as pseudo scalar under improper rotation, is proposed to be coupled to the EM dynamics in the WSMs or Dirac semimetals. If such a pseudo scalar phonon mode is unpolarised, it will become optically active under the external magnetic field, manifesting the CME in these materials. Such CME induced phonon-EM wave coupling can be detected easily by the optical reflectivity spectroscopy near the phonon frequency, providing a new experimental way to study the CME in topological semimetals.
