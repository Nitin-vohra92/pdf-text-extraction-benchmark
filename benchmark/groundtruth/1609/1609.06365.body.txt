Phenomenological Implications of the pT Spectra of φ and Ω produced at LHC and RHIC

The production of φ and Ω at LHC with pT reaching as high as 5 GeV/c (for φ) [\cite=al1] and 7 GeV/c (for Ω) [\cite=al2] has not been discussed in any theoretical framework ranging from hydrodynamics to QCD. Both the extent of the pT range and the constituents being only s quarks present challenges to the usual theories. Because of those difficulties we find it opportune to investigate the subject in a novel phenomenological way with the hope of discovering clues to what may be flaws in the conventional interpretation of what happens in heavy-ion collisions at very high energies.

The pT spectra of φ have been fitted in [\cite=al1] by blast wave in the hydro model [\cite=bl] using 3 free parameters for each centrality bin. Undoubtedly, the same can be done for the Ω spectra. So what does one learn from the 6 parameters for each centrality? We propose a different way to examine the pT spectra. The usual presentation of data is in terms of dNh / pTdpT. Let us define for meson and baryon data, respectively, the two functions

[formula]

which are just different ways of presenting of the same data without theoretical adjustments. Note that they have different dimensions. In Figs. 1 and 2 we show the distribution s Mφ(pT) and BΩ(pT) using only the data points in [\cite=al1] [\cite=al2]. They show the strikingly simple exponential behaviors in pT for nearly all centralities. The straight-line fits of both distribution s amazingly have the same inverse slope

[formula]

a property that is totally hidden in the original data.

Seeing two different functions of different dimensions having the same inverse slope in semi-log plots stimulates curiosity. Exponential behavior in pT usually means thermal distribution, but being valid out to pT  ≈  6 GeV/c is not what QCD thermodynamics can offer to explain. The fits in Figs. 1 and 2 can be expressed in the factorizable form

[formula]

where the centrality dependences for Npart > 70 can be shown to satisfy

[formula]

What is found above for [formula] TeV at LHC turns out to be also true at lower energies with different inverse slopes down to 7.7 GeV at RHIC [\cite=rhphi] [\cite=rhomega130] [\cite=rhomega200] [\cite=bes]. In Fig. 3 we show how Tφ,Ω depends on [formula] empirically. The extension of the power-law behavior to 5.02 TeV yields Tφ,Ω = 0.54 GeV/c, which is a prediction without theory. We note that the values of Tφ,Ω shown in Fig. 3 are not the temperatures discussed in hydro models.

Now, we summarize briefly how the observed behaviors of Mφ and BΩ can be understood in the recombination model, a review of which can be found in the first few sections of [\cite=reco]. The invariant distribution of φ at mid-rapidity is

[formula]

where only the thermal-parton distribution s, T(pi), are retained, since the production of strange shower partons is suppressed. The recombination function Rφ(p1,p2,pT) contains a momentum-conservation factor δ((p1 + p2) / pT - 1). Inserting into (7) Ts(p1) = p01dNs / dp1 = Csp1e- p1 / Ts where Ts is the inverse slope for s quark distribution, and a similar form for Ts̄(p2), yields (with the assumption Ts = Ts̄)

[formula]

where Zφ is a numerical factor arising from the integration. At y  ≈  0 where E  ≈  mT, Eq. (8) can be put into the form for Mφ given in (4) with Aφ(Npart) = CsCs̄Zφ and Tφ = Ts.

For Ω production three Ts̄(pi) are involved in EdNΩ  /  dpT, so one obtains (5) with AΩ(Npart) = C3sZΩ and TΩ = Ts. Comparing Mφ with BΩ, one gets Tφ = TΩ = Ts and that the ratio Aφ(Npart) / AΩ(Npart) is proportional to CsCs̄ / C3s, which agrees with the empirical Npart dependence in (6) at LHC, i.e., 2:3 in the exponents, in the reasonable assumption that Cs̄ depends on Npart as Cs does.

What is important in our description above is that we have made no mention of flow. There is no need for radial velocity, Tkin or blast wave. The system must expand in some way, but it need not be prescribed by hydrodynamics without jets. We have for nearly all centralities used only one parameter Ts, which we have referred to as inverse slope, not temperature, although Ts(pi) is regarded as thermal distribution. Since hadronization by recombination occurs at the end of the evolutionary process, we have not made use of any specific expansion dynamics. Ts(pi) is the invariant s quark distribution at the time of hadronization without any contribution from the shower partons that arise from fragmentation of high-pT jets. But at LHC minijets are copiously produced and must influence the bulk of the medium that hydro ignores. In our view Ts(pi) must contain the effects of minijets.

The most notable feature about the above description is that the common value of the inverse slopes in Figs. 1 and 2 is Tφ,Ω = 0.51 GeV/c, as given in (3) for [formula] TeV. Even at 7.7 GeV in the BES program the value is Tφ,Ω = 0.27 GeV/c, still much larger than the chemical freeze-out temperature of Tch < 0.165 GeV and kinetic freeze-out temperature of Tkin < 0.14 GeV [\cite=bm]. The fact that the exponential fits of Mφ(pT) and BΩ(pT) are so good for such a wide range of pT demands an explanation. An equation such as (8) relates Ts to the observed value of Tφ,Ω but does not explain why Ts is so high. Our first step is to ask how high Ts is relative to the inverse slope for light quarks. It turns out that, when (1) is applied to pions, Mπ(pT) cannot be fitted by a simple exponential because the fragmentation products and resonance decay contributions bend the distribution above a straight line at both high and low pT regions. The situation is better for Bp(pT) for proton, but still not as good as in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, the common straight-line fits of Mπ(pT) and Bp(pT) yields Tπ,p = 0.41 GeV/c. That gives us an estimate of the difference between TΩ and Tp: ΔT = TΩ - Tp = 0.1 GeV/c at LHC. A similar comparison at RHIC-200 yields ΔT = 0.065 GeV/c.

That leads us to recall the difference in inverse slopes when ridge was first discovered by STAR [\cite=jp]: Tridge - Tincl=40-50 MeV. We use the STAR data for Au-Au collisions at 200 GeV and compare d2N / dpTdy at mid-rapidity between π + p (0-10%) and φ  +  Ω (0-5%) as shown in Fig. 4. In the range between pT = 1.5 and 4 GeV/c, which is the range on ridge in [\cite=jp], the data can be well fitted by straight lines, showing the difference in inverse slopes to be Tφ  +  Ω - Tπ + p = 55 MeV. That gives us a strong hint that φ and Ω may be a component in the ridge, but instead of being in the triggered events, they are identified.

So far there are no data from LHC on the passocT dependence of the particles in the ridge. However, CMS does have evidence that the ridge yield increases with decreasing ptrigT [\cite=cms]. Since a trigger particle comes from the fragmentation of a hard parton that emerges from the expanding medium, lower ptrigT is more likely to be associated with a hard parton originated from the interior of the medium, thus losing a larger portion its energy traversing that medium. The energy lost enhances the thermal partons, so the ridge that comes from the enhanced thermal partons [\cite=reco] [\cite=hz] gets higher inverse slope and thus more yield. To confirm our interpretation that φ and Ω are in the ridge with higher Tφ,Ω than Tπ,p, we need data from LHC to identify φ and Ω in the triggered events and to compare the inverse slopes of their passocT distribution s with (3).

In the usual QCD thermodynamics the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperatures are less than 160 MeV. The larger [formula], corresponding to our much larger value of inverse slope Tφ,Ω, is then achieved in hydro models by transverse flow, which is a description predicated on the assumption that the system evolving smoothly from early times. But we know from the parton distribution functions F(x) that they increase steeply with decreasing momentum fraction x, so in an AA collision the probability is high for scattering among low-x partons resulting in a preponderance of minijets which can propagate inside the expanding medium and lose energy in ways that invalidate the rapid thermalization hypothesis. Minijets with pT  ~   2-3 GeV/c cannot be calculated reliably in pQCD, but their effects cannot be ignored. They are almost all absorbed by the environment, resulting in enhancement of the thermal partons that creates the ridge phenomenon [\cite=hz] [\cite=hw]. The minijets can produce more ss̄ pairs than in equilibrium QCD thermodynamics. It is therefore natural for us to interpret the large value of Tφ,Ω in (3) as a manifestation of s quarks in the ridge. If future LHC data can verify the correlation between (φ,Ω) and the ridge, then they not only give support to our view that is outside hydro flow, but also pose a strong challenge to any other approach for a satisfactory explanation.
