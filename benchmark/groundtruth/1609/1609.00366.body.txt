Rigidity of Free Boundary Surfaces in Compact 3-manifolds with Strictly Convex Boundary

Introduction

A classical result due to Toponogov [\cite=Toponogov] (see [\cite=HangWang] for an alternative proof) says that if M2 is a closed Riemannian surface with Gaussian curvature [formula], then the length of any closed simple geodesic γ  ⊂  M2 satisfies [formula]. Furthermore, if L(γ) = 2π, then M2 is isometric to the standard unit 2-sphere [formula].

In order to obtain a version of Toponogov theorem in dimension 3, Bray, Brendle, Eichmair, and Neves [\cite=BrayBrendleEichmairNeves] considered a real projective plane Σ2 embedded into a compact Riemannian 3-manifold M3. They proved that if Σ has least area among all real projective planes embedded into M, and M has scalar curvature [formula], then the area of Σ satisfies [formula]. Moreover, if A(Σ) = 2π, then M3 is isometric to [formula] endowed with the canonical metric.

A few months later, Bray, Brendle, and Neves [\cite=BrayBrendleNeves] considered the case of an area minimizing 2-sphere in a compact Riemannian 3-manifold M3. As a consequence of their result, if Σ2 is an embedded 2-sphere of least area in its isotopy class, and [formula], then [formula]. Furthermore, if A(Σ) = 4π, then the universal cover of M3 is isometric to [formula] endowed with the canonical product metric. In particular, M3 is isometric to [formula] in a neighborhood of Σ. See [\cite=CaiGalloway] and [\cite=Nunes] for similar results.

In a more recent work, Marques and Neves [\cite=MarquesNeves] considered the case of unstable minimal 2-spheres. Among other things, they proved that if 〈  ,  〉 is a Riemannian metric on S3 with scalar curvature [formula], but 〈  ,  〉 has not constant sectional curvature one, then there exists a minimal 2-sphere Σ2 embedded into M3 = (S3,〈  ,  〉) satisfying A(Σ) < 4π. Also, Σ has index zero or one. This can be seen as an analogue of Toponogov theorem in dimension 3, since, in general, there is no area bound for minimal 2-spheres in M3, as pointed out in [\cite=MarquesNeves].

Our goal in this work is to obtain a version of Toponogov theorem in dimension 3 for compact manifolds with nonempty boundary. Before stating our results, let us remember an important result in the setting.

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Denote by FM the set of all immersed disks in M whose boundaries are homotopically nontrivial curves in ∂M. If [formula], define

[formula]

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Assume that ∂M is mean convex and [formula]. Then,

[formula]

where R is the scalar curvature of M and H∂M is the mean curvature of ∂M. Furthermore, if equality holds, the universal cover of M is isometric to [formula], where Σ0 is the disk with constant Gaussian curvature inf MR / 2 whose boundary ∂Σ0 has constant geodesic curvature inf ∂MH.

An immediate consequence of Ambrozio theorem is that if inf MR = 0, inf ∂MH∂M = 1, and L(M) = 2π, then the universal cover of M is isometric to [formula], where [formula] is the unit disk in [formula] endowed with the canonical metric.

Observe that Ambrozio's result is an analogue of Bray-Brendle-Neves theorem for 3-manifolds with nonempty boundary. Motivated by Marques and Neves' work [\cite=MarquesNeves], we consider the case of unstable minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds with nonempty boundary.

Now, let us state our first result. Definitions will be given in Section [\ref=Section.2].

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the Ricci tensor of M and [formula] is the second fundamental form of ∂M. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface of index one in M3, then the length of ∂Σ satisfies

[formula]

where g is the genus of Σ and r is the number of connected components of ∂Σ. Moreover, if equality holds, we have:

Σ (w.r.t. the induced metric from M) is isometric to the Euclidean unit disk [formula];

∂Σ is a geodesic of ∂M;

Σ is totally geodesic in M; and

all sectional curvatures of M vanish on Σ.

In [\cite=FraserSchoen], Fraser and Schoen proved that if Σ2 is a compact orientable surface with nonempty boundary, then [formula], where σ1(Σ) is the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of Σ. On the other hand, Fraser and Li [\cite=FraserLi] proved that if [formula], [formula], and Σ2 is a properly embedded minimal surface in M3 with free boundary in ∂M, then [formula]. As a corollary, they obtained that [formula]. However, this bound is not sharp. Thus, Theorem [\ref=theorem.1.3] is an improvement in Fraser and Li's result to a sharp upper bound when we assume that Σ has index one.

If we make an extra assumption on the geometry of M along ∂M, we can characterize the global geometry of M when equality in ([\ref=eq.theorem.1.3]) holds.

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula], [formula], and [formula] for all p∈∂M, where KM is the sectional curvature of M. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface of index one in M3, then the length of ∂Σ satisfies

[formula]

Furthermore, if equality holds, M3 is isometric to the Euclidean unit 3-ball 3 and Σ2 is isometric to the Euclidean unit disk [formula].

Using Theorem [\ref=theorem.1.4] together with the isoperimetric inequality for minimal disks in [formula] (see [\cite=BarbosadoCarmo] for the general case), we have a sharp upper bound for the area of a properly embedded free boundary minimal disk of index one in a strictly convex domain in [formula].

Let Ω be a smooth bounded domain in [formula] whose boundary ∂Ω is strictly convex, say [formula], where [formula] is the second fundamental form of ∂Ω in [formula]. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal disk of index one in Ω, then the area of Σ satisfies

[formula]

Moreover, if equality holds, Ω is the Euclidean unit 3-ball and Σ2 is the Euclidean unit disk.

For the general case of a free boundary minimal surface (not necessarily a disk) of index one in a strictly convex domain Ω in [formula], we introduce the constant

[formula]

and have the following result.

Let Ω be a smooth bounded domain in [formula] whose boundary ∂Ω is strictly convex, say [formula]. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface of index one in Ω, then the area of Σ satisfies

[formula]

Moreover, if equality holds, Ω is the Euclidean unit 3-ball and Σ2 is the Euclidean unit disk.

Would be very interesting to know if when M3 satisfies [formula] and [formula], but M3 is not isometric to 3, there exists a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface Σ2 of index one in M3 satisfying L(∂Σ) < 2π(g + r).

In Section [\ref=Section.3] we obtain similar results to Theorems [\ref=theorem.1.3] and [\ref=theorem.1.4] for stationary stable surfaces. We point out that Theorems [\ref=theorem.1.5] and [\ref=theorem.1.6] are also true for stationary stable minimal surfaces.

Free boundary minimal surfaces of index one

Let M3 be a compact connected Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Along this work, we assume that M has nonnegative Ricci curvature and that ∂M is strictly convex, which means [formula] for all [formula] and p∈∂M, where X is the outward pointing unit normal to ∂M and D is the Levi-Civita connection of M. Here, [formula] is the second fundamental form of ∂M in M. Under these hypotheses, by [\cite=FraserLi], M3 is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean unit 3-ball 3. In particular, M is orientable.

Let Σ2 be a compact surface with nonempty boundary ∂Σ. Suppose Σ2 is properly embedded into M3, i.e., Σ2 is embedded into M3 and [formula]. Since M3 is diffeomorphic to the unit ball 3, which is simply connected, Σ must be orientable. Fix a unit normal to Σ, say N, and denote by A the second fundamental form of Σ, that is, A(Y,Z) = 〈DYN,Z〉, Y,Z∈TxΣ, x∈Σ. Also, denote by ν the outward pointing conormal along ∂Σ in Σ. We say that Σ is free boundary if Σ meets ∂M orthogonally. In other words, Σ is free boundary if ν = X along ∂Σ.

Let t  ↦  Σt, t∈( - ε,ε), be a variation of Σ  =  Σ0. It is well known that the first variation of area is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the variation vector field, φ  =  〈ξ,N〉, and [formula] is the mean curvature of Σ in M. It follows from ([\ref=eq.1]) that Σ is a critical point for the functional area for variations that preserve the property [formula] if and only if Σ is minimal and free boundary. Also, if Σ is minimal and free boundary, the second variation of area is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the index form of Σ given by

[formula]

Above, [formula] is the Ricci tensor of M and Δ is the Laplace operator of Σ with respect to the induced metric from M.

We say that φ∈C∞(Σ) is an eigenfunction of I associated to the eigenvalue [formula] if I(ψ,φ) = λ〈ψ,φ〉L2(Σ) for all ψ∈C∞(Σ). This is equivalent to say that φ solves the Robin-type boundary value problem

[formula]

where [formula] is the Jacobi operator of Σ. If Σ is minimal and free boundary, the index of Σ is defined as the number of negative eigenvalues of I counted with multiplicities. The index of Σ is denoted by [formula]. It is well known that the first eigenvalue λ1 of I is characterized by the Rayleigh formula

[formula]

Thus, it follows directly from ([\ref=eq.4]) that, under the assumptions [formula] and [formula], all free boundary minimal surfaces have index at least one, since I(1,1) < 0.

Before proving our first result, we are going to state a very important lemma. This lemma is based on an argument presented in [\cite=Hersch] (see also [\cite=LiYau]).

Let Σ2 be a compact Riemannian surface with nonempty boundary ∂Σ. Suppose that F:Σ  →   and [formula] are continuous functions such that [formula] and [formula]. Then, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

See Appendix A.

Our first result is the following.

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the Ricci tensor of M and [formula] is the second fundamental form of ∂M. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface of index one in M3, then the length of ∂Σ satisfies

[formula]

where g is the genus of Σ and r is the number of connected components of ∂Σ. Moreover, if equality holds, we have:

Σ (w.r.t. the induced metric from M) is isometric to the Euclidean unit disk [formula];

∂Σ is a geodesic of ∂M;

Σ is totally geodesic in M; and

all sectional curvatures of M vanish on Σ.

Let [formula] be the first eigenfunction of I. We know that φ1 does not change sign. Then, without loss of generality, we can assume [formula]. Since [formula], for all f∈C∞(Σ) with [formula], we have [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

On the other hand, by [\cite=Gabard], there exists a proper conformal branched cover F:Σ  →   satisfying deg (F)  ≤  g + r. By Lemma [\ref=lemma.Hersch], we can assume [formula], where F = (f1,f2). Then, using fi (i = 1,2) as test function in ([\ref=eq.aux.1]), we have

[formula]

where above we have used that [formula] and [formula]. Hence, because [formula], since F is proper, and F is conformal,

[formula]

which implies ([\ref=eq.theorem.1]).

If equality in ([\ref=eq.theorem.1]) holds, all inequalities above must be equalities. Then, [formula], [formula] on Σ, and [formula] along ∂Σ. Using the Gauss equation [formula], where K is the Gaussian curvature of Σ and R is the scalar curvature of M, we have [formula]. Observe that, since Σ is free boundary (ν = X along ∂Σ), the geodesic curvature of ∂Σ in Σ is given by [formula], where T is the unit tangent to ∂Σ. Then, by Gauss-Bonnet theorem,

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

which implies r = 1 and g = 0. Then, all inequalities above must be equalities. So, [formula] and [formula]. Also, observe that the geodesic curvature [formula] of ∂Σ in ∂M (w.r.t. N) satisfies  = g(DTN,T) = A(T,T) = 0, thus ∂Σ is a geodesic of ∂M. Now, let x∈Σ and {e1,e2,e3 = N}  ⊂  TxM be such that {e1,e2} is an ortonormal base of TxΣ and denote by KM the sectional curvature of M. Since [formula] on Σ and [formula] everywhere, we have [formula] on Σ for i = 1,2,3. Thus,

[formula]

which implies KM(ei,ej) = 0, i  ≠  j.

Below, we are going to present some corollaries of Theorem [\ref=theorem.1]. But, before doing that, let us state an important result due to Xia [\cite=Xia].

Let Mn + 1 be a compact Riemannian (n + 1)-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula] and [formula] for some constant c > 0, where [formula] is the Ricci tensor of M and [formula] is the second fundamental form of ∂M in M. Then, the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace operator acting on functions on ∂M (w.r.t. the induced metric from M) satisfies

[formula]

Furthermore, the equality holds if and only if Mn + 1 is isometric to the Euclidean unit (n + 1)-ball of radius 1 / c.

Our first corollary is the following.

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula], [formula], and [formula] for all p∈∂M, where KM is the sectional curvature of M. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface of index one in M3, then the length of ∂Σ satisfies

[formula]

Furthermore, if equality holds, M3 is isometric to the Euclidean unit 3-ball 3 and Σ2 is isometric to the Euclidean unit disk [formula].

Denote by K∂M the Gaussian curvature of ∂M (w.r.t. the induced metric from M). Also, denote by k1 and k2 the principal curvatures of ∂M in M. By Gauss equation,

[formula]

Now, if L(∂Σ) = 2π(g + r), by Theorem [\ref=theorem.1], Σ2 is isometric to [formula] and ∂Σ is a geodesic of ∂M. In particular, ∂Σ is a simple (because Σ is embedded into M) geodesic of ∂M with L(∂Σ) = 2π. Then, by Toponogov theorem, ∂M is isometric to the standard unit 2-sphere [formula]. Thus, by Xia theorem, M3 is isometric to 3.

Using the corollary above together with the isoperimetric inequality for minimal disks in [formula] (see [\cite=BarbosadoCarmo] for the general case), we have a sharp upper bound for the area of a properly embedded free boundary minimal disk of index one in a strictly convex domain in [formula].

Let Ω be a smooth bounded domain in [formula] whose boundary ∂Ω is strictly convex, say [formula], where [formula] is the second fundamental form of ∂Ω in [formula]. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal disk of index one in Ω, then the area of Σ satisfies

[formula]

Moreover, if equality holds, Ω is the Euclidean unit 3-ball and Σ2 is the Euclidean unit disk.

The isoperimetric inequality for minimal disks in [formula] says that

[formula]

Then, by Theorem [\ref=theorem.1], A(Σ)  ≤  L(∂Σ)2 / (4π)  ≤  π. Moreover, if A(Σ) = π, then L(∂Σ) = 2π, which by Corollary [\ref=corollary.1] implies that Ω is the Euclidean unit 3-ball and Σ2 is the Euclidean unit disk.

For the general area estimate we will introduce a constant depending on the domain. For this purpose, let Ω be a smooth bounded domain in [formula] whose boundary ∂Ω is strictly convex, say [formula]. Define R(Ω) by

[formula]

It is not difficult to see that

[formula]

Moreover, since [formula], we have K∂Ω  ≥  1, which by Bonnet-Myers theorem implies that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

R(Ω) > 0 is the smallest real number δ > 0 such that Ω  ⊂  B3(x,δ) for some x∈Ω, where B3(x,δ) is the Euclidean 3-ball of radius δ > 0 and center x.

Our result is the following.

Let Ω be a smooth bounded domain in [formula] whose boundary ∂Ω is strictly convex, say [formula]. If Σ2 is a properly embedded free boundary minimal surface of index one in Ω, then the area of Σ satisfies

[formula]

Moreover, if equality holds, Ω is the Euclidean unit 3-ball and Σ2 is the Euclidean unit disk.

Let y0∈Ω be such that sup x∈∂Ω|x - y0| = R(Ω). Define [formula] by [formula]. Since Σ is minimal, we have Δf = 2. Then,

[formula]

Therefore, using [formula] into the last inequality above, we get ([\ref=eq.General.Area.Estimate]).

Now, if A(Σ) = π(g + r)R(Ω), then L(∂Σ) = 2π(g + r). The result follows from Corollary [\ref=corollary.1].

Stationary stable surfaces

In this section we obtain a similar result to Theorem [\ref=theorem.1] for stationary stable surfaces and some of its consequences.

As before, let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Assume that [formula] and [formula]. Also, let Σ2 be a properly embedded compact surface in M3 with nonempty boundary ∂Σ. We say that Σ is stationary if it is a critical point for the functional area for variations that preserve the property [formula] and are volume-preserving (see [\cite=RosVergasta]). Equivalently, Σ is stationary if it has constant mean curvature and is free boundary. A stationary surface Σ is called stable if its second variation of area is nonnegative for variations as cited before, which is equivalent to say that

[formula]

for all φ∈C∞(Σ) satisfying [formula].

Our result is the following.

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. If Σ2 is a properly embedded stationary stable surface in M3, then the length of ∂Σ satisfies

[formula]

where g is the genus of Σ and r is the number of connected components of ∂Σ. Moreover, if equality holds, we have:

Σ (w.r.t. the induced metric from M) is isometric to the Euclidean unit disk [formula];

∂Σ is a geodesic of ∂M;

Σ is totally geodesic in M; and

all sectional curvatures of M vanish on Σ.

Since Σ is stationary stable, by ([\ref=eq.7]), we have

[formula]

for all f∈C∞(Σ) satisfying [formula]. Let F = (f1,f2):Σ  →   be a proper conformal branched cover as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem.1]. Using Lemma [\ref=lemma.Hersch], we can assume [formula]. Then,

[formula]

which proves ([\ref=eq.theorem.2]).

If equality holds, working exactly as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem.1], we have the result.

The first consequence of Theorem [\ref=theorem.2] is the following.

Let M3 be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M. Suppose that [formula], [formula], and [formula] for all p∈∂M, where KM is the sectional curvature of M. If Σ2 is a properly embedded stationary stable surface in M3, then the length of ∂Σ satisfies

[formula]

Furthermore, if equality holds, M3 is isometric to the Euclidean unit 3-ball 3 and Σ2 is isometric to the Euclidean unit disk [formula].

Below we have a characterization of the Euclidean unit 3-ball by the length of the boundary of properly embedded stationary stable disks in it.

The only smooth bounded domain [formula], with boundary ∂Ω satisfying [formula], which admits a properly embedded stationary stable disk Σ2  ⊂  Ω with L(∂Σ) = 2π is the unit ball.

Corollaries [\ref=corollary.2] and [\ref=corollary.3] are also true if we change the hypothesis "minimal of index one" by "stationary stable minimal".

In [\cite=RosVergasta], Ros and Vergasta observed that the only free boundary minimal surfaces of index one in the ball 3 is the totally geodesic disks passing through the center of the ball. Also, they proved that "the only stationary stable surfaces in 3 are the totally geodesic disks, the spherical caps or surfaces of genus 1 with embedded boundary having at most two connected components". Recently, Nunes [\cite=Nunes2016] ruled out the existence of the latter kind of surfaces, i.e., he proved, among other things, that a stationary stable surface in 3 must have genus zero.

By [\cite=ChenFraserPang], under the same assumptions of Theorem [\ref=theorem.1], g = 0,1 and r = 1,2,3 or g = 2,3 and r = 1. In the case of smooth bounded domains in [formula] with strictly convex boundary, it follows from the index estimates obtained in [\cite=AmbrozioCarlottoSharp] and [\cite=Sargent] that [formula] implies g = 0 (and r = 1,2,3,4) or g = 1 and r = 1,2. In the same case, applying the techniques of [\cite=Nunes2016] for minimal surfaces of index one instead of stationary stable surfaces, we can see that g = 0,1 if [formula].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma.Hersch]

If φ1 = 0, the result is trivial. Then, without loss of generality, we can assume [formula]. Let [formula] be given by

[formula]

for each [formula]. Define [formula] by

[formula]

It follows from Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem that f is continuous. Now, we want to extend f to [formula] continuously. For this purpose, first observe that, if [formula],

[formula]

for all [formula]. Then,

[formula]

where above we have used that [formula]. Second, if [formula] with [formula], we have

[formula]

for all [formula]. Then, defining f(a) =  - a for [formula], by Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, [formula] is continuous.

Now, observe that |f(a)|  ≤  1 for all a∈. Then, f:  →   is a continuous function satisfying f(a) =  - a for [formula]. Thus, by topological reasons, f is onto. Therefore, there exists [formula] such that f(a0) = 0. Take h = ma0.
