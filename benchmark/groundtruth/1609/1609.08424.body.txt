Abstract. We consider the approximation of a continuous function, defined on a compact set of the d-dimensional Euclidean space, by sums of two ridge functions. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such a sum to be a best approximation. The result resembles the classical Chebyshev equioscillation theorem for polynomial approximation.

1. Introduction

Let Q be compact set in the d-dimensional Euclidean space and C(Q) be the space of continuous real-valued functions on Q. Consider the approximation of a function f∈C(Q) by sums of the form [formula] where [formula] are fixed vectors (directions) in [formula] and gi are continuous univariate functions. We are interested in characterization of a best approximation. Note that functions of the form [formula] are called ridge functions. These functions and their linear combinations arise naturally in problems of computerized tomography (see, e.g., [\cite=Log]), statistics (see, e.g., [\cite=Fri] [\cite=Hub]), partial differential equations [\cite=John] (where they are called plane waves), neural networks (see, e.g., [\cite=P2] and references therein), and approximation theory (see, e.g., [\cite=7] [\cite=17] [\cite=Pel] [\cite=Pet]). In the past few years, problems of ridge function representation have gained special attention among researchers (see e.g. [\cite=Ali] [\cite=Kon1] [\cite=Kon2] [\cite=Pin]). For more on ridge functions and application areas see a recently published monograph by Pinkus [\cite=P1].

Characterization theorems for best approximating elements are essential in approximation theory. The classical and most striking example of such a theorem are the Chebyshev equioscillation theorem. This theorem characterizes the unique best uniform approximation to a continuous real valued function F(t) by polynomials P(t) of degree at most n, by the oscillating nature of the difference F(t) - P(t). The result says that if such polynomial has the property that for some particular n + 2 points ti in

[formula]

. The monograph of Natanson [\cite=Nat] contains a very rich commentary on this theorem. Some general alternation type theorems applying to any finite dimensional subspace E of C(I) for I a cell in [formula], may be found in Buck [\cite=Buck]. For a short history and various modifications of the Chebyshev alternation theorem see [\cite=Bro].

In this note, we obtain an equioscillation theorem for approximation of multivariate functions by sums of two ridge functions. To be more precise, let Q be a compact subset of the space [formula]. Fix two directions [formula] and [formula] in [formula] and consider the following space Note that the space R is a linear space. Assume a function f∈C(Q) is given. We ask and answer the following question: which geometrical conditions imposed on G0∈R is necessary and sufficient for the equality

Here [formula] denotes the standard uniform norm in C(Q). Recall that functions G0 satisfying (1.1) are called best approximations or extremal elements.

It should be remarked that in the special case when [formula] and [formula] and [formula] coincide with the coordinate directions, the above question was answered by Khavinson [\cite=Kh]. In [\cite=Kh], he obtained an equioscillation theorem for a best approximating sum φ(x) + ψ(y). In our papers [\cite=7] [\cite=11], Chebyshev type theorems were proven for ridge functions under additional assumption that Q is convex. For a more recent and detailed discussion of an equioscillation theorem in ridge function approximation see Pinkus [\cite=P1].

2. Equioscillation theorem for ridge functions

We start with a definition of paths with respect to two directions. These objects will play an essential role in our further analysis.

Definition 2.1 (see [\cite=11]).  A finite or infinite ordered set [formula] with [formula] and either [formula] or [formula]is called a path with respect to the directions [formula] and [formula].

In the sequel, we will simply use the term path instead of the expression path with respect to the directions [formula] and [formula] . If in a finite path [formula], [formula] and n is an even number, then the path [formula] is said to be closed. Note that for a closed path [formula] and any function G∈R, [formula].

Paths, in the special case when [formula], [formula] and [formula] coincide with the coordinate directions, are geometrically explicit objects. In this case, a path is a finite ordered set [formula] in [formula] with the line segments , i = 1,...,n, alternatively perpendicular to the x and y axes (see, e.g., [\cite=Arn] [\cite=5] [\cite=6] [\cite=Is2] [\cite=Is3] [\cite=12] [\cite=Mar1]). These objects were first introduced by Diliberto and Straus [\cite=4] (in [\cite=4], they are called permissible lines ). They appeared further in a number of papers with several different names such as bolts" (see, e.g., [\cite=Arn] [\cite=12] [\cite=Mar1]), trips (see [\cite=Mar2]), links" (see, e.g., [\cite=Cow] [\cite=Klo1] [\cite=Klo2]), etc. Paths with respect to two directions [formula] and [formula] were exploited in some papers devoted to ridge function interpolation (see, e.g., [\cite=BP] [\cite=IP]). In [\cite=9] [\cite=10], paths were generalized to those with respect to a finite set of functions. The last objects turned out to be very useful in problems of representation by linear superpositions.

In the sequel, we need the concept of an extremal path", which is defined as follows.

Definition 2.2 (see [\cite=11]). A finite or infinite path [formula] is said to be extremal for a function h∈C(Q) if [formula] or [formula] i = 1,2,...

The purpose of this note is to prove the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1.  Assume Q is a compact subset of [formula]. A function G0∈R is a best approximation to a function f∈C(Q) if and only if there exists a closed or infinite path [formula] extremal for the function f - G0.

Proof. Sufficiency. There are two possible cases. The first case happens when there exists a closed path [formula] extremal for the function f - G0. Let us check that in this case, f - G0 is a best approximation. Indeed, on the one hand, the following equalities are valid.

On the other hand, for any function G∈R, we have

Therefore, [formula] for any G∈R. That is, G0 is a best approximation.

The second case happens when we do not have closed paths extremal for f - G0, but there exists an infinite path [formula] extremal for f - G0. To analyze this case, consider the following linear functional

where [formula] is a finite path in Q. It is easy to see that the norm [formula] and [formula] if and only if the set of points of q with odd indices [formula] i is an odd number} do not intersect with the set of points of q with even indices [formula] i is an even number}. Indeed, from the definition of lq it follows that [formula] for all functions F∈C(Q), whence [formula] If [formula], then for a function F0 with the property [formula] if i is odd, [formula] if i is even and - 1 < F0(x) < 1 elsewhere on Q, we have [formula] Hence, [formula]. Recall that such a function F0 exists on the basis of Urysohn's great lemma.

Note that if q is a closed path, then lq annihilates all members of the class R. But in general, when q is not closed, we do not have the equality lq(G) = 0, for all members G∈R. Nonetheless, this functional has the important property that

where g1 and g2 are ridge functions with the directions [formula] and [formula], respectively, that is, [formula] and [formula] This property is important in the sense that if n is sufficiently large, then the functional lq is close to an annihilating functional. To prove (2.1), note that [formula] and [formula]. These estimates become obvious if consider the chain of equalities [formula] [formula](or [formula] [formula]) for [formula] and the corresponding chain of equalities for [formula] Now consider the infinite path [formula] and form the finite paths [formula] k = 1,2,.... For ease of notation, let us set lk = lpk. The sequence {lk}∞  k = 1 is a subset of the unit ball of the conjugate space [formula] By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, the unit ball is weak[formula] compact in the weak[formula] topology of [formula] (see, e.g., Rudin [\cite=Rud]). From this theorem we derive that the sequence {lk}∞  k = 1 must have weak[formula] cluster points. Suppose [formula] denotes one of them. Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] as k  →    ∞  . From (2.1) it follows that [formula] That is, [formula] where the symbol [formula] stands for the annihilator of R. Since in addition [formula] we can write that

for all functions G∈R. On the other hand, since the infinite bolt p is extremal for f - G0

Therefore,

From (2.2) and (2.3) we conclude that

for all G∈R. In other words, G0 is a best approximation to f. We proved the sufficiency of the theorem.

Necessity. The proof of this part is mainly based on the following theorem of Singer.

Theorem 2.2 (see Singer [\cite=S]). Let X be a compact space, U be a linear subspace of C(X), [formula] and u0∈U. Then u0 is a best approximation to f if and only if there exists a regular Borel measure μ on X such that

(1) The total variation [formula];

(2) μ is orthogonal to the subspace U, that is, [formula] for all u∈U;

(3) For the Jordan decomposition μ  =  μ+  -  μ-, where S+ and S- are closed supports of the positive measures μ+ and μ-, respectively.

Let us show how we use this theorem in the proof of necessity part of our theorem. Assume G0∈R is a best approximation. For the subspace R, the existence of a measure μ satisfying the conditions (1)-(3) is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.2. Let [formula] be any point in S+. Consider the point [formula] and a δ-neighborhood of y0. That is, choose an arbitrary δ > 0 and consider the set [formula] Here, [formula] [formula] For any subset [formula], put

Clearly, for some sets E, one or both the sets Ei may be empty. Since [formula] is not empty (note that [formula]), it follows that μ+(I1δ) > 0. At the same time μ(I1δ) = 0, since μ is orthogonal to all functions [formula] Therefore, μ-(I1δ) > 0. We conclude that [formula] is not empty. Denote this intersection by Aδ. Tending δ to 0, we obtain a set A which is a subset of S- and has the property that for each [formula] we have [formula] Fix any point [formula]. Changing [formula], μ+, S+ to [formula], μ- and S- correspondingly, repeat the above process with the point [formula] and a δ-neighborhood of y1. Then we obtain a point [formula] such that [formula] Continuing this process, one can construct points [formula], [formula], and so on. Note that  the set of all constructed points [formula], i = 0,1,..., forms a path. By Theorem 2.2, this path is extremal for the function f - G0. We have proved the necessity and hence Theorem 2.1.

Remark. Theorem 2.1 was proven by Ismailov [\cite=7] and in a more general form by Pinkus [\cite=P1] under additional assumption that Q is convex. Convexity assumption was made to guarantee continuity of the following functions

where F is an arbitrary continuous function on Q. Note that in the proof given above we need not continuity of these functions.
