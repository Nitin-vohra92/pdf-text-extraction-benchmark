Hamiltonian approach to GR - Part 1: covariant theory of classical gravity

1 - Introduction

This is the first paper of a two-part investigation dealing with the manifestly-covariant Hamiltonian theory of the gravitational field, and more precisely, the one which is associated with the Einstein field equations, i.e., the so-called Standard Formulation of General Relativity (SF-GR) [\cite=ein1] [\cite=hilb] [\cite=LL] [\cite=gravi] [\cite=wald]. The aim of the paper is to identify a suitably-reduced continuum Hamiltonian structure realized by the ensemble [formula] represented by an appropriate variational canonical state [formula] and a corresponding variational Hamiltonian density HR. This will be referred to in the following as Classical Hamiltonian Structure (CHS) of SF-GR. Its basic feature is that of being based on the adoption of a synchronous variational principle earlier developed in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2] for the variational formulation of General Relativity. The basic idea underlying this type of variational approach is that of distinguishing variational and extremal tensor fields in such a way that the variational ones are allowed to possess different physical properties with respect to the extremal fields, while preserving at the same time the correct validity of the extremal equations (i.e., in this case the Einstein field equations). The issue will be discussed in detail in Section 2 below. In the realm of the classical theory the physical behavior of variational fields provide the mathematical background for the establishment of a manifestly-covariant Hamiltonian theory of GR. When passing to the covariant quantum theory variational fields become quantum observables and inherit the corresponding tensor transformation laws of classical fields. The novel synchronous variational setting is found to be naturally consistent with the principles of covariance and manifest covariance at the basis of GR itself, so that it proves to be necessary in order to establish a proper covariant quantum theory of gravitational field and its consistency with the classical theory.

According to such an approach the 4 - scalar, i.e., invariant, 4 - volume element of the space-time (dΩ) entering the action functional is considered independent of the functional class of variations, so that it must be defined in terms of a prescribed metric tensor field [formula], represented equivalently either in terms of its covariant or counter variant component, i.e. either [formula] or [formula]. Here [formula] and [formula] denote respectively an arbitrary GR-frame parametrization and an arbitrary particular solution of the Einstein field equations. This is obtained therefore upon identifying in the action functional dΩ with

[formula]

d4r being the corresponding canonical measure expressed in terms of the said parametrization and [formula] denoting as usual the determinant of the metric tensor [formula]. In the context of the synchronous variational principle to GR a further requirement is actually included which demands that the prescribed field qμν(r) must determine, besides dΩ, also the geometric properties of space-time. This means that qμν(r) should uniquely prescribe the tensor transformation laws of arbitrary tensor fields, which may depend in principle, besides qμν(r), both on the variational state x and the 4 - position [formula]. This requires in particular that qμν(r) and qμν(r) respectively lower and raise tensor indexes of the same tensor fields. In a similar way qμν(r) uniquely determines also the standard Christoffel connections which enter both the Ricci tensor and the covariant derivatives of arbitrary variational tensor fields. Therefore, in the context of synchronous variational principle to GR the approach known in the literature as "background space-time picture" [\cite=Drummond2000] [\cite=Moffayt2012] [\cite=Hossenfelder2009] is adopted, whereby the background space-time [formula] is considered prescribed a priori in terms of qμν(r), while leaving unconstrained all the variational fields [formula] and in particular the Lagrangian coordinates [formula].

In this paper we intend to prove that HR and the canonical momenta π can be realized so that the latter are prescribed in terms of second-order 4 - tensor fields, i.e., [formula], with [formula] being the 4 - position spanning the said space-time. In addition, we intend to show that a suitable Lagrangian Path (LP) parametrization of the canonical state [formula] can be achieved letting

[formula]

where [formula] and s, for [formula], identify respectively the field geodetics and the corresponding proper-time associated with the prescribed tensor field qμν(r) indicated above. It follows that the corresponding continuum canonical equations, denoted here as GR-Hamilton equations, are found to be realized, as in ordinary classical mechanics, by means of evolution equations advancing in proper time the canonical state. As a basic consequence, the formulation of the corresponding canonical transformation and Hamilton-Jacobi theories is achieved.

Indeed, as pointed out in Ref.[\cite=noi2], the physical interpretation which arises from the manifestly-covariant Hamiltonian theory of GR exhibits a connection with the so-called induced gravity (or emergent gravity) [\cite=emerg2] [\cite=emerg1], namely the conjecture that the geometrical properties of space-time reveal themselves as a mean field description of microscopic stochastic or quantum degrees of freedom underlying the classical solution. In the present approach this is achieved by introducing a prescribed metric tensor [formula] in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian action functionals, which is held constant in the variational principles when performing synchronous variations and has to be distinguished from the variational field [formula]. More precisely, [formula] acquires a geometrical interpretation, since by construction it raises/lowers tensorial indices and prescribes the covariant derivatives. In this picture, [formula] arises as a macroscopic prescribed mean field emerging from a background of variational fields [formula], all belonging to a suitable functional class. This permits to introduce a new representation for the action functional in superabundant variables, depending both on [formula] and [formula]. Such a feature, as explained above, is found to be instrumental for the identification of the covariant Hamiltonian structure associated with the classical gravitational field and provides a promising physical scenario where to develop a covariant quantum treatment of GR.

Several key implications of the theory follow. In particular, it is shown that the canonical momenta can always be prescribed in such a way to have the physical dimensions of an action, a feature required for the establishment of a quantum theory of GR in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Second, by construction the GR-Hamilton equations are covariant with respect to arbitrary canonical transformations. This property implies that the same equations are covariant with respect to arbitrary local point transformation (LPT), i.e., the so-called LPT-group which leaves invariant a given space-time represented by the differential manifold of the type [formula], so that the General Covariance Principle and the so-called Principle of Manifest Covariance are necessarily both fulfilled by construction. On the other hand it is obvious the same canonical equations should hold for arbitrary choices of the background space-time. The latter might in fact be equivalently realized by the two intrinsically-different space-times, say [formula] and [formula], i.e., which cannot be mapped in each other by means of transformations of the LPT-group. This means that the corresponding GR-Hamilton equations valid in the two cases should be connected by means of suitable canonical transformations. On the other hand - as shown in Ref.[\cite=noi4] - space-times of this type are generally mapped in each other by so-called non-local point transformations (NLPT) which belong to the so-called NLPT-group. Therefore one expects the NLPT to be realized by means of suitable canonical transformations too. Consequently, the GR-Hamilton equations should exhibit an extended covariance property with respect to arbitrary transformation of the NLPT-group (Principle of Extended Covariance).

Goals and scheme of the paper

After recalling the theoretical foundations of the new synchronous variational approach reported in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2], in the present paper the problem is addressed of determining a suitably-reduced Hamiltonian formulation of GR. In particular we intend to show that the validity of the new approach follows from the variational theory reported there and that, as a consequence, also the corresponding formulations of canonical transformation and Hamilton-Jacobi theories are permitted. Such a topic is intrinsically related to the foundations of General Relativity as well its quantum treatment. Indeed, one has to acknowledge the fact that the Hamiltonian description of classical systems is a mandatory conceptual prerequisite for achieving a corresponding quantum description [\cite=FoP1] [\cite=FoP2], i.e., in the case of continuum systems, the related relativistic quantum field theory. This task involves the identification of the appropriate Hamiltonian representation of the continuum field, to be realized by means of the following steps: Step #1: Establishment of underlying Lagrangian and Hamiltonian variational action principles. Step #2: Construction of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, realized respectively in terms of appropriate continuum Lagrangian and Hamiltonian equations. Step #3: Determination of the corresponding set of continuum canonical transformations and formulation of the related Hamilton-Jacobi theory.

The proper realization of these steps remains crucial. In actual fact, the last target appears as a prerequisite of foremost importance for being able to reach a consistent formulation of relativistic quantum field theory for General Relativity, i.e., the so-called Quantum Gravity. The conclusion follows by analogy with Electrodynamics. In fact, as it emerges from the recent investigation concerning the axiomatic foundations of relativistic quantum field theory for the radiation-reaction problem associated with classical relativistic extended charged particles (see Refs.[\cite=EPJ1] [\cite=EPJ2] [\cite=EPJ3] [\cite=EPJ4] [\cite=EPJ5] [\cite=EPJ6] [\cite=EPJ7] [\cite=EPJ8]), it is the Hamilton-Jacobi theory which naturally provides the formal axiomatic connection between classical and quantum theory, to be established by means of a suitable realization of the quantum correspondence principle.

Prerequisite for reaching such goals in the context of relativistic quantum field theory is the establishment of a theory fulfilling at all levels both the Einstein general covariance principle and the principle of manifest covariance. The first one states that any relativistic physical theory, such as the standard formulation of general relativity represented by the Einstein field equations, should be endowed with tensor transformation laws with respect to the group of invertible local point transformations connecting arbitrary GR-reference frames, i.e., 4 - dimensional curvilinear coordinate systems which span the same prescribed curved space-times. The latter are identified in the following with the set [formula], where [formula] denotes the 4 - dimensional Riemann space-time and [formula] is the corresponding metric tensor parametrized in terms of [formula]. Instead, according to the principle of manifest covariance, it should always be possible to identify in terms of suitable 4 - tensor quantities all (discrete or continuum) physical fields, in particular the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian continuum variables as well as all of the equations involving them.

Such a viewpoint is mandatory in order that the axiomatic construction method of SF-GR makes any sense at all [\cite=haw] [\cite=penrose]. Indeed, in order that physical laws have an objective physical character they cannot depend on the choice of the GR reference frame. Manifestly, this requisite can only be met provided all classical physical observables and the corresponding mathematical relationships holding among them, i.e., the physical laws, can actually be expressed in tensorial form with respect to the group of transformations indicated above. In the context of SF-GR the adoption of the same strategy requires therefore the realization of Steps #1-#3 in manifest covariant form. As far as the actual identification of Steps #1 and #2 for SF-GR is concerned, the candidate is represented by the variational theory reported in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2]. The distinctive features of such a variational theory, which set it apart from previous Hamiltonian formulations in literature [\cite=h1] [\cite=h2] [\cite=h3] [\cite=h4] [\cite=h5] [\cite=h6] [\cite=h7], lie in its consistency with the criteria indicated above and its analogy with the DeDonder-Weyl classical field theory approach [\cite=donder] [\cite=weyl] [\cite=sym1] [\cite=sym2] [\cite=sym3] [\cite=sym4] [\cite=sym5] [\cite=sym6] [\cite=sym7] [\cite=sym8] [\cite=sym9].

Nevertheless, a number of questions arise, which are intrinsically related to the continuum Hamiltonian theory reported in Ref.[\cite=noi2]. This involves posing the following distinct goals:

GOAL #1: Reduced continuum Hamiltonian theory for SF-GR - The search for a reduced-dimensional realization of the continuum Hamiltonian theory for the Einstein field equations, which still satisfies the principle of manifest covariance. In fact, as a characteristic feature of the DeDonder-Weyl approach, in the Hamiltonian theory given in Ref.[\cite=noi2] the canonical variables defining the canonical state have different tensorial orders, with the momenta being realized by third-order 4 - tensors. In contrast, the new approach to be envisaged here should provide a realization of the canonical state in which both generalized coordinates and corresponding momenta have the same tensorial dimension, so that they should be represented by second-order 4 - tensors.

GOAL #2: Evolution form of the reduced continuum Hamilton equations - A further problem intimately related to GOAL #1 is whether a causal evolution form, to be referred to as canonical evolution equations, can actually be recovered for the same reduced continuum Hamilton equations. Since the latter are realized by PDE, this means that some sort of Lagrangian representation should be determined. Therefore the issue arises whether the same Lagrangian parametrization actually exists in the context of GR for a suitable realization of the Hamilton equations in a suitably-reduced form, in such a way that they can be cast in the form of causal equations generating the evolution of the corresponding canonical fields by means of a suitable canonical flow.

GOAL #3: Realization of canonical transformation theory - Issues #1-#2 motivate the search for a possible realization of the canonical transformation theory associated with the reduced Hamiltonian equations.

GOAL #4: Realization of manifestly-covariant continuum Hamilton-Jacobi theory - A related question which arises involves, in particular, the determination of the canonical transformation which generates the flow corresponding to the continuum canonical evolution equations. This concerns, more precisely, the development of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory and the investigation of the canonical transformation generated by the corresponding Hamilton principal function.

GOAL #5: Global prescription and regularity properties of the corresponding GR-Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations should be globally prescribed in the appropriate phase-spaces. The global prescription should include also the validity of suitable regularity properties of the corresponding Hamiltonian density HR.

GOAL #6: Identification of the gauge properties,of the classical GR-Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities. The related issue concerns the identification of the possible gauge indeterminacies, in terms of suitable gauge functions, characterizing the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities and how they might affect the form of the corresponding Hamilton equations.

GOAL #7: Extended covariance property of the theory. The transformation properties of the Hamiltonian structure [formula] are investigated with respect to arbitrary non-local point transformation belonging to the NLPT-group [\cite=noi4]. For this purpose, as a reference case, the problem is posed of constructing the canonical transformation which generates the non-local point point transformation which maps mutually in each other a generic curved space-time [formula] and a flat Minkowski space-time [formula].

GOAL #8: Dimensionally-normalized form of CHS. In particular, the goal here is to show that a suitable dimensional normalization of the Hamiltonian structure [formula] can be reached in order to prescribe the physical dimensions of canonical momenta, as demanded for the formulation of the quantum theory. More precisely this involves the construction of a non-symplectic canonical transformation for the GR-Hamiltonian density HR. The issue is to show that this can be taken of the form:

[formula]

where κ is the dimensional constant [formula], L is a 4 - scalar scale length to be defined, α is a suitable dimensional scalar, while [formula] and [formula] denote the corresponding transformed effective kinetic energy and potential densities defining the transformed Hamiltonian density [formula]. Then the question arises whether α can be prescribed in such a way that the transformed canonical momentum [formula] has the dimensions of an action.

GOAL #9: Statistical relationship between the canonical state [formula] and the prescribed tensor field [formula] - A related issue is the determination of the connection between the variational state [formula] and the extremal state represented by [formula], with q(s) being identified with the prescribed metric tensor [formula] associated with the background space-time. We intend to show that such a relationship can be established by means a suitable statistical average to be performed on the initial state xR(so) (or equivalently on the state xR(s)). As a consequence the variational states x(s) can be interpreted as stochastic tensors endowed with a suitable stochastic phase-space probability density. The latter is shown to obey a Liouville equation which together with an appropriate initial condition for the phase-space PDF in principle uniquely determines the same PDF. Key consequence is the validity of suitable GR-hydrodynamic equations, which include in particular the classical GR-continuity equation advancing in proper time the configuration-space classical stochastic probability density associated with the variational tensor field [formula], as well as corresponding GR-Euler equation and a GR-constant H-theorem for the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy.

GOAL #10: Stability theory for the vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations - The final issue concerns application of the present theory to the stability theory. In fact, the possibility arises that, depending on the specific realization of CHS considered here, arbitrary vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations may exhibit different stability behaviors, i.e., be stable/unstable or marginally stable, with respect to infinitesimal perturbations whose dynamics is governed by the said canonical evolution equations. In particular, the goal is to point out possible suggested prescriptions for the gauge functions indicated above which characterize the GR-Hamiltonian density.

In view of these considerations and of the results already achieved in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2], in this paper the attention will be focused on the investigation of GOALS #1-#10 together with the analysis of some of their most physically-relevant implications. These topics, together with the continuum Lagrangian and Hamiltonian theories proposed in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2], have potential impact in the context of both classical and quantum theories of General Relativity.

2 - Theory of extended continuum Hamilton equations for SF-GR

To start with, in this section the Hamiltonian equations for SF-GR earlier developed in Ref.[\cite=noi2], and referred to here as extended continuum Hamilton equations, are reviewed in order to gain an insight on the physical meaning of the Hamiltonian theory and its basic features.

2A - Synchronous and asynchronous variational approaches to SF-GR

A common theoretical feature shared by GR as well as classical field theory is the variational character of the fundamental dynamical laws which identify these disciplines. This feature is well-known both in the case of the classical theory of fields and for the relativistic dynamics of discrete point-like or extended particles since it permits to establish manifestly-covariant variational formulations and to determine, in turn, the Hamiltonian structure of these systems.

However, the treatment of the non-vacuum Einstein field equations in the framework of the standard formulation of GR is peculiar since it involves the abstract structure of the same equations as well as the prescription of the geometry of space-time itself on which the equations are defined. Indeed, the Einstein equations provide a second order PDE which determine in principle arbitrary particular realizations of the space-time metric field tensor [formula] associated with the space-time [formula] and which corresponds to prescribed sources and boundary conditions. In the case of a non-vanishing cosmological constant (Λ) this is realized by the boundary-value problem associated with the equations [\cite=alcu]

[formula]

The same problem is assumed to be well-posed, i.e., endowed with a unique solution existing everywhere in a suitable 4 - dimensional space-time D4 to be identified with a connected and time-oriented Lorentzian differentiable manifold [formula]. The notations in Eqs.([\ref=eis]) are standard. Thus, [formula] defines the symmetric Einstein tensor, Rμν is the Ricci curvature 4 - tensor

[formula]

R is the Ricci scalar, while Γαμν are non-tensorial quantities identified with the so-called standard connections. Finally, the external source term on the rhs of the Einstein field equation ([\ref=eis]) is expressed in terms of a suitably-defined symmetric stress-energy tensor Tμν (see Ref.[\cite=noi1]). The solution of the boundary-value problem ([\ref=eis]) in D4 depends both on the boundary ∂Ω itself and on the boundary-value field [formula], to be assumed suitably prescribed. Such a solution actually coincides identically with the so-called "extremal" field qμν(r) which enters the synchronous variational principles reported in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2] (see also the related discussion below), i.e., in the sense that for all [formula]

[formula]

Hence, by construction, when invoking Eq.([\ref=idetinfication]), Eqs.([\ref=eis]) are identically satisfied. For definiteness, in the following all hatted quantities or operators of the form [formula] will identify functions of the extremal field [formula], namely of the type  = F(qμν(r)). Thus, in particular, αμν and α denote respectively the standard connections and the covariant derivative both defined with respect to qμν(r). This means that Eq.([\ref=eis]) is actually sided by the metric compatibility condition for the covariant derivative of [formula], namely the constraint equation

[formula]

Hence, for any smooth tensor field [formula] due to the chain rule it follows necessarily that also

[formula]

On the other hand, Eq.([\ref=metric-com]) provides a unique relationship between [formula] and the standard connections αμν since by construction the latter ones enter the covariant derivative operator [formula] (see Refs.[\cite=LL] [\cite=wald]). In particular, Eq.([\ref=metric-com]) yields the definition of the Christoffel symbols, which for a generic metric tensor [formula] are given by

[formula]

In the case of vacuum, i.e., when the external source is taken [formula], but still Λ  ≠  0, the Einstein field equations ([\ref=eis]) reduce to the form

[formula]

implying in turn that in such a case

[formula]

so that the Ricci scalar is constant. The key steps of the construction method of manifestly-covariant continuum Lagrangian or Hamiltonian variational formulations for the Einstein equations have been discussed extensively in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2]. The novelty characterizing such a method is the adoption of a new type of variational approach for classical continuum fields, based on so-called synchronous (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) variational principles. The new variational approach distinguishes itself from previous literature formulations based instead on asynchronous variational principles. The two cases differ in the prescription of the functional setting for the variational classical fields, whereby the 4 - scalar 4 - volume element ([\ref=4-scalar_volume_elements]) in the action functional is treated in such a way that:

A) Synchronous variation: dΩ is held fixed during an arbitrary variation performed on the same dΩ, so that identically

[formula]

with δ denoting the synchronous variation operator.

B) Asynchronous variation: dΩ is not held fixed with respect to an arbitrary variation, so that the corresponding variation is generally non vanishing and takes the form

[formula]

In this case δ identifies the asynchronous variation operator.

Notice that in the first case the validity of the constraint equation ([\ref=CONSTRAINT-1]) requires that by construction the metric tensor appearing in its definition must actually be identified with a suitably-prescribed metric tensor. This can always be identified with the extremal field qμν(r) defined above. Hence, by construction the synchronous variation operator δ must leave invariant qμν(r) so that

[formula]

Therefore, variational principles based on synchronous variations are necessarily constrained ones, namely such that any smooth tensor function [formula] should satisfy identically the constraint equation

[formula]

As pointed out in Ref.[\cite=noi1], the adoption of synchronous variational principles has important implications, since it permits to warrant the fulfillment of the properties of manifest covariance and gauge invariance for the definition of the variational Lagrangians, the canonical variables and the representation of the symbolic Euler-Lagrange equations.

2B - The extended Hamiltonian variational principle

Given these premises, let us briefly recall the basic features of the extended Hamiltonian theory and corresponding extended Hamilton equations for GR achieved in Ref.[\cite=noi2]. This is based on a suitable representation of the Lagrangian variational functional earlier introduced in Ref.[\cite=noi1] in terms of superabundant canonical variables. The property of manifest covariance demands, however, a well-defined choice of the functional setting. In fact, the canonical variables, the variational Lagrangian as well the variational action functional itself should all be represented by 4 - tensors only. More precisely, to this end - in agreement with the DeDonder-Weyl approach and in the framework of a synchronous variational principle - one should assume that the same action functional is identified with a real 4 - scalar of the type

[formula]

with [formula] denoting the 4 - scalar volume element and x and x̂ appropriate variational and prescribed (or extremal) canonical states. Here.[formula] is a suitable 4 - scalar real variational Lagrangian density, generally depending besides x,x̂ also on the 4 - position [formula] (see also Eq.([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZATION_OF_H_R]) below). The choice of these variables (i.e., x and x̂) remains, however, intrinsically non-unique. In particular, according to Ref.[\cite=noi2] a possible choice of the extremal canonical fields are given by the set

[formula]

namely they are prescribed in terms of the extremal metric tensor [formula] and its identically-vanishing conjugate momentum αμν(r), while qμν(r) is uniquely determined by the boundary-value problem associated with the Einstein field equations (see Eqs.([\ref=eis])). Instead, in the same reference the variational canonical state is taken of the form

[formula]

with gμν(r) and Παμν(r) denoting suitably-smooth real 4 - tensor fields. Notice that gμν(r) is a symmetric second-order 4 - tensor, while Παμν(r) is a third-order 4 - tensor which is symmetric in the lower indices. By construction the variational fields gμν(r) and Παμν(r) are assumed to identify a couple of conjugate canonical variables according to the DeDonder-Weyl formalism, where gμν(r) plays the role of a generalized Lagrangian coordinate and Παμν(r) is the corresponding conjugate momentum. Concerning the Lagrangian function [formula] we notice that it can be represented in terms of the canonical variables x, x̂ in the form

[formula]

i.e., it identifies the Legendre transform of the corresponding variational Hamiltonian density [formula], with Παμναgμν denoting the so-called "exchange term". Notice that here α is the covariant derivative defined in terms of the connections which are evaluated with respect to the prescribed metric tensor qμν(r). Furthermore, in analogy with the customary notation adopted in classical mechanics, [formula] can be formally represented according to the following symbolic prescription:

[formula]

where T(x,x̂) and V(g,x̂,r) play the role of effective kinetic and effective potential energy densities. One notices for this purpose that extending the treatment given in Ref.[\cite=noi2] these can be taken respectively of the general form

[formula]

with f(h) and σ denoting suitable multiplicative gauges which remain in principle still arbitrary at this point. More precisely, f(h) identifies an a priori arbitrary non-vanishing and smoothly-differentiable real gauge function depending on the variational weight-factor [formula] introduced in Ref.[\cite=noi1] and prescribed in such a way that

[formula]

We anticipate here that the function f(h) will be shown in Part 2 to be identically

[formula]

as required by quantum theory. Furthermore, σ denotes the additional constant gauge function

[formula]

Here the notation is standard. Thus, the two 4 - scalars

[formula]

identify respectively the gravitational and external-field source contributions. In particular the field Lagrangian [formula] defined in Ref.[\cite=noi1] is related to the stress-energy tensor

[formula]

appearing on the rhs of Eq.([\ref=eis]). In addition, in Eq.([\ref=POT-ENERGY-SOURCES-2])

[formula]

identifies the Ricci tensor evaluated in terms of the prescribed tensor field qμν(r). Finally, the variational canonical momentum Παμν is related to the covariant derivative of gμν(r) as follows:

[formula]

Then, as shown in Ref.[\cite=noi2] it follows that once the synchronous variational principle

[formula]

is prescribed in terms of the synchronous variation operator δ, the two corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations in symbolic form, namely represented in terms of the functional derivatives of the action functional [formula], become

[formula]

It must be stressed that, only provided the variation operator δ is identified with the synchronous variation operator indicated above (i.e., it satisfies identically the constraint equation Eq.([\ref=CONSTRAINT-1])), then Eqs.([\ref=EULER-LAGRANGE_SYMBOLIC]) are by construction in manifestly covariant 4 - tensor form. In view of Eqs.([\ref=legendre-hh]) and ([\ref=HAMILTONIAN]) these take the form

[formula]

where the partial derivatives on the rhs are evaluated keeping constant the extremal state x̂. These equations identify the canonical equations introduced in Ref.[\cite=noi2] and referred to here as extended Hamilton equations of GR. Notice that these equations must be evaluated for extremal fields in order to coincide with the Einstein equations, according to the procedure outlined below in Subsection 2C and based on the so-called "collapse condition".

The construction of the continuum Lagrange equations corresponding to Eqs.([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L]) follows in a standard way by means of straightforward algebra. Indeed, for this purpose it is sufficient to construct explicitly the Lagrangian equations in terms of Eqs.([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L]). This is obtained introducing first the continuum Lagrangian states corresponding to Eqs.([\ref=CAN.STATE-EXTREMAL]) and ([\ref=CAN.STATE-VARIATIONAL]), namely letting

[formula]

[formula]

Then, representing in terms of [formula] the variational Lagrangian density [formula] one notices that

[formula]

[formula]

where now [formula] and [formula] identify respectively the variational Lagrangian density and the variational Lagrangian action functional both evaluated with respect to the Lagrangian states ([\ref=LAGRANGIAN-STATE-VARIATIONAL]) and ([\ref=LAGRANGIAN-STATE-extremal]). The continuum Lagrangian Euler-Lagrange equations follow immediately from the canonical equations ([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L]). They are manifestly realized by the single second-order PDE

[formula]

again to be evaluated for extremal fields.

It must be stressed that in the variational formulation recalled here, for convenience the tensor fields R̂μν and α have been assumed to be extremal. However, such a constraint is not strictly necessary. In fact, as shown in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2], an equivalent formulation of the same variational principle could be equally obtained by implementing the method of the Lagrange multipliers and by regarding all the tensor fields, like the Ricci tensor, as independent variational fields. In this way, it is possible to recover the correct extremal field equations, while the only necessary constraint to be invoked for the validity of the synchronous variational principle remains the condition of synchronous variation ([\ref=CONSTRAINT-1]), to be distinguished from the corresponding asynchronous condition ([\ref=no-constraint]) usually applied in the literature.

2C - Collapse conditions for the extended Hamilton equations

In the framework of the synchronous variational principle expressed in superabundant variables the resulting Lagrangian and Hamiltonian equations for GR depend necessarily on both the tensors gμν(r) and qμν(r). For the validity of the same variational principle, these equations must reduce/coincide with the Einstein field equations ([\ref=eis]) provided suitably-prescribed realizations of the canonical tensor fields are considered, which are denoted here as collapse conditions (see Ref.[\cite=noi2]). In particular, extending the approach introduced in Ref.[\cite=noi2], we intend to show that from a mathematical point of view this property can apply on the extremal Euler-Lagrange equations and be satisfied in different equivalent ways as follows:

A) The first application of the collapse condition is obtained when the identification [formula] is set everywhere in D4. In fact, since by construction [formula] while αqμν = 0, it follows that Eq.([\ref=LAGRANGIAN-E-L]) reduces to

[formula]

which recovers identically the Einstein equation ([\ref=eis]).

B) A second realization of the collapse condition is obtained when the identification ([\ref=idetinfication]) is set on the boundary conditions to be introduced on the Euler-Lagrange PDEs for the same tensor fields. In fact, once this requirement is imposed, the extended Hamilton equations manifestly reduce identically to

[formula]

which again coincides identically with Eq.([\ref=eis]). Therefore, application of the collapse condition on the boundary is exactly equivalent to evaluate all differential terms in Eqs.([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L]) for x = x̂.

C) As a third realization of the collapse condition, we notice that this can be interpreted in terms of an appropriate limit to be taken for the continuum Hamilton equations after introduction of a suitable parametrization of the variational field gμν(r) with respect to qμν(r). In fact, due to the arbitrariness of the the variational fields [formula], it is always possible to introduce for them a parametrization of the form

[formula]

where β is a real parameter independent of x, x̂ and [formula], which belongs to the interval [formula], while Δgμν(r,β) and ΔΠαμν(r,β) are still arbitrary parameter-dependent smoothly-differentiable 4 - tensor fields. These can, in particular, be prescribed in such a way that the variational tensor fields [formula] are collapsed to the extremal fields [formula] when the limit β  →  0 it taken. This property manifestly demands that the following limits hold on the canonical variables:

[formula]

Instead, as far the canonical equations ([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L]) is concerned, once the limit β  →  0 is taken they manifestly collapse to the Einstein filed equations. Indeed in such a case by construction the following limit equations must hold:

[formula]

so that the identity

[formula]

necessarily applies too. Finally, we notice that the same result is recovered when the continuum Lagrange equation ([\ref=LAGRANGIAN-E-L]) is collapsed in the limit β  →  0. This is obtained now by invoking the parametrization ([\ref=parametrization-1]) together with the requirement ([\ref=PRESCRIPTIONS-1]). In fact, then by construction it follows identically

[formula]

while the second term in Eq.([\ref=LAGRANGIAN-E-L]) yields

[formula]

and hence recovers again the Einstein field equations ([\ref=eis]).

3 - Reduced form of the Hamilton equations for SF-GR

In this section the problem of the determination of a reduced continuum Hamiltonian theory of GR is addressed. Such a theory represents a requirement for the construction of a Hamilton-Jacobi theory of GR. In particular, this target requires to find a suitable realization of the variational canonical momentum [formula] in such a way that the corresponding reduced canonical state is characterized by fields and reduced momenta which have the same tensorial order, namely they are both expressed in terms of a couple of second-rank conjugate 4 - tensors. The requisite is that the resulting reduced Hamiltonian theory must preserve the functional form of the variational Hamiltonian density [formula] together with the validity of the non-vacuum Einstein field equations when the collapse condition is applied. This in turn must permit to achieve a suitable set of reduced continuum Hamilton equations. The construction of these equations is based on the following three steps.

3A - Step #1: Prescription of a reduced-dimensional canonical momentum

For this purpose, first the real 4 - tensor tγ(q(r),r) is introduced such that identically

[formula]

so that by construction tγ(q(r),r) is tangent to an arbitrary geodetics belonging to an arbitrary 4 - position [formula] of the space-time [formula] [\cite=LL]. In addition, it satisfies the normalization condition known as mass-shell condition, so that it can be regarded as a 4 - velocity. Second, one notices that letting

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

where [formula] represents the reduced canonical momentum, which according to Eq.([\ref=REALIZATION-2]) is obtained as the projection of [formula] along the tangent vector tα(q(r),r). The set of continuum fields [formula] and [formula] will be referred to here as reduced canonical state and reduced extremal state respectively. As a consequence, the Hamiltonian density [formula] defined according to Eq.([\ref=HAMILTONIAN]) can be expressed in terms of the reduced canonical variables. This yields

[formula]

where V(g,x̂,r) is the effective potential energy density given in Eq.([\ref=KINETIC_ENERGY_DENSITY]) and [formula] now identifies the reduced effective kinetic energy density

[formula]

It must be noticed that a characteristic feature of the projection introduced here in terms of the tangent 4 - vector tα(q(r),r) is that of preserving the physical dimensions of the Hamiltonian function, so that by construction [formula]. This follows precisely because by definition tα(q(r),r) is dimensionless.

In terms of [formula] and recalling the continuum Hamilton equations ([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L]) one obtains after straightforward algebra a set of PDE for the reduced canonical state, i.e.,

[formula]

with [formula] denoting the directional covariant derivative evaluated in terms of α, namely

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=reduced_CONTINUUM_HAMILTON_EQ]) will be denoted as the reduced Hamilton equations.

The fact that the same equations are variational follows as a direct implication of the variational principle earlier invoked for the extended Hamilton equations, i.e., Eq.([\ref=VARIATIONAL_PRINCIPLE]). In fact it is immediate to show that the variational action functional [formula] is by construction invariant under the transformation

[formula]

This follows first from Eq.([\ref=reduced_HAMILTONIAN]) and second by noting that the variational Lagrangian density [formula] (see Eq.([\ref=legendre-hh])) coincides identically with the reduced Lagrangian density

[formula]

Hence, the variational functional [formula] prescribed according to Eq.([\ref=FUNCTIONAL]) necessarily coincides identically with the reduced functional

[formula]

As a consequence, the variational principle ([\ref=VARIATIONAL_PRINCIPLE]) for the extended state warrants the validity of the related variational principle obtained in terms of the reduced functional [formula], so that Eqs.([\ref=reduced_CONTINUUM_HAMILTON_EQ]) necessarily coincide with the corresponding reduced Euler-Lagrange equations, namely

[formula]

We notice that the equivalence between extended and reduced states is due to the particular choice of the tangent 4 - vector tγ(q(r),r) and the assigned functional dependence on the extremal fields.

3B - Step #2: Lagrangian path

In the second step we introduce the notion of Lagrangian path (LP) [\cite=FoP1] [\cite=FoP2] associated with the 4 - vector tμ(q(r),r). The LP is identified with the geodetic curve

[formula]

which is solution of the initial-value problem

[formula]

Here the notations are as follows. First, the 4 - scalar s is the proper-time along the same curve [formula], namely defined so that

[formula]

Second, tμ(s) identifies the LP - parametrized 4 - vector [formula]. In Eq.([\ref=LP_equation]) [formula] identifies the ordinary derivative with respect to s. In the following we shall denote as implicit s - dependences the dependences on the proper time s appearing in the variational fields through the LP parametrization of the fields. In contrast, we shall denote as explicit [formula]dependences the proper-time dependences which enter either explicitly on s itself or through the dependence on [formula] (see in particular the treatment of canonical transformations reported below).

3C - Step #3: LP-parametrization of the reduced Hamilton equations

Let us now introduce the parametrization obtained replacing everywhere in all the relevant tensor fields [formula] with [formula], namely obtained identifying

[formula]

This yields for the Hamiltonian density HR(s) the so-called LP-parametrization in terms of which the reduced Hamilton equations ([\ref=reduced_CONTINUUM_HAMILTON_EQ]) can in turn be represented (see below). In the remainder, for greater generality, such a representation shall be taken of the form

[formula]

i.e., including also a possible explicit dependence in terms of the proper time s. Specific examples in which explicit s - dependences may occur in the theory will be discussed in the following sections. We refer here to:

1) Continuum canonical transformations and in particular canonical transformations generating local or nor local point transformations (see Section 4 and furthermore Section 6, with particular reference to Appendix B). In this cases explicit s - dependences may arise in the transformed Hamiltonian density due to explicit s - dependent generating functions.

2) Hamilton-Jacobi theory (Section 5), where in a similar way the explicit s - dependence in the Hamiltonian density may be generated by the canonical flow.

3) Stability theory for wave-like perturbations where explicit s - dependences may appear instead in the variational fields xR = xR(s) (see Section 9).

We notice at this point that, once the LP parametrization is introduced, the formal replacement

[formula]

can be made in the reduced Hamilton equations for the 4 - scalar differential operator [formula] defined by Eq.([\ref=directional_cov_ariant_detrivative]). Here, the differential operator [formula] is defined according to the chain rule as

[formula]

which is referred to here as the covariant s - derivative. The introduction of the operator [formula] is allowed since, as indicated above, an explicit s dependence can appear in the Hamiltonian function when the LP-parametrization is adopted. As shown below, the introduction of the operator [formula] is instrumental for the development of a consistent Hamilton-Jacobi theory of GR.

As a result of this procedure the following set of reduced canonical equations in evolution form, to be referred hereon as GR-Hamilton equations, is obtained

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the reduced Poisson bracket evaluated with respect to the canonical variables xR, namely

[formula]

We notice, furthermore, that here the partial derivatives are performed keeping constant the prescribed extremal state x̂ as well as the remaining variables r,s and namely letting

[formula]

Then, after elementary algebra the GR-Hamilton equations ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]) yield

[formula]

In particular, invoking Eqs.([\ref=KINETIC_ENERGY_DENSITY])-([\ref=POT-ENERGY-SOURCES]) it follows

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] given by Eqs.([\ref=Ricci_tensor]) and ([\ref=stress-energy-tensor]) denote the LP-parametrizations of the Ricci and stress-energy tensors. Hence the canonical equations ([\ref=canonical_evolution_equations_-2]) reduce to the single equivalent Lagrangian evolution equation for the variational field gμν(s) in the LP-parametrization:

[formula]

Notice here that the previous equation is obtained in validity of requirement ([\ref=REQUIREMENT-PART2]). Finally, it is worth pointing out that the LP-parametrized equations ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]) are - as expected - variational too. Once again the conclusion is a direct implication of the same variational principle which has been invoked for the extended Hamilton equations, i.e., Eq.([\ref=VARIATIONAL_PRINCIPLE]). This follows by introducing the LP-parametrization for the reduced canonical state, i.e., letting

[formula]

so that the reduced Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities take the form [formula] and [formula] according to the definitions given above (see Eqs.([\ref=reduced_Lagrangian_density]) and ([\ref=reduced_HAMILTONIAN])). In particular one obtains that

[formula]

while the reduced functional [formula] defined above (see Eq.([\ref=reduced_functional])) now takes the form

[formula]

with dΩ denoting the invariant volume element ([\ref=4-scalar_volume_elements]). Hence, it is immediate to show that the Eqs.([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]) again equivalently follow from the variational principle corresponding to the functional [formula], namely

[formula]

In other words, they necessarily coincide with the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations analogous to Eqs.([\ref=reduced_E-L]).

4 - Continuum canonical transformations

In this section the problem is posed of the construction of canonical transformations, namely state transformations which preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the continuum Hamilton equations for GR. For definiteness we shall adopt here the reduced canonical evolution equation ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]). In doing so, we shall regard the reduced variational canonical state [formula] and the extremal one [formula] as independent. Let us therefore consider a phase-space map between the states [formula] and the transformed ones [formula] realized in terms of a local diffeomorphism of the general form

[formula]

with inverse

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] respectively, with Gμν(r) and Pμν(r) identifying the transformed field and conjugate reduced momentum, while all tensor fields must be parametrized in terms of [formula] when adopting the LP-parametrization in the reduced Hamiltonian theory. Notice that here, for greater generality, when treating the reduced canonical state, both direct and inverse transformations are allowed to depend also explicitly on the 4 - position [formula].

We now pose the problem of constructing canonical transformations for the GR-Hamilton equations ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]). In principle, in analogy to classical particle dynamics, these can be either realized in terms of symplectic or non-symplectic transformations. For illustration we shall consider here the first case only. This requires that the transformed state XR is canonical, in the sense that there exists a reduced transformed Hamiltonian function [formula] with respect to which the transformed variational state XR satisfies the reduced canonical evolution equations

[formula]

where [formula]. The solution can be couched either in terms of the so-called Lie theorem relating the fundamental Lagrangian differential forms expressed in two different sets of canonical variables, or via the continuum Poisson bracket formalism. The first route leads to the introduction of the mixed-variable generating functions which permit in principle the explicit construction of the transformations ([\ref=4-2]) and ([\ref=4-3]). This goal can be actually reached provided suitable regularity conditions are met by the generating functions. The second approach instead provides algebraic conditions which warrant the existence of canonical transformations.

Let us consider initially the first approach, i.e., for mixed-variable generating functions, which is based on the well-known Poincarè-Von Zeipel approach (see Ref.[\cite=Goldstein]). Then, mixed-variable generating functions of the generic form [formula] can be distinguished in four types:

[formula]

which are mutually related by means of appropriate Legendre transformations [\cite=sym9]. For example, S1 can be assumed to be of the form

[formula]

We are particularly interested in the canonical transformation associated with the function [formula], which in the formalism of classical mechanics is usually interpreted as generating the causal dynamical flow [\cite=Goldstein]. This yields in the case of symplectic canonical transformations the following transformation laws:

[formula]

and for the transformed Hamiltonian

[formula]

where in the last equation the partial derivative [formula] is performed only with respect to the explicit s - dependence (and not the implicit dependence possibly occurring through g and r).

Here Eqs.([\ref=CAN-1]) and ([\ref=CAN-2]) identify respectively half of the inverse and direct transformations for the variational fields, Eqs.([\ref=CAN-3]) and ([\ref=CAN-4]) are the corresponding transformations for the extremal fields, and finally Eq.([\ref=CAN-.5]) determines the transformed Hamiltonian density [formula]. Then, the local existence of both the direct and inverse transformations is warranted if the condition on the Hessian determinant [formula] is satisfied.

A particular example of such a case is provided by symplectic coordinate transformations of the form

[formula]

with

[formula]

being the corresponding coordinate transformation holding for the extremal metric tensors. Eqs.([\ref=rt]) and ([\ref=rt-2]) permit in principle to map in each other the metric tensors of arbitrary 4 - dimensional space-times [formula] and [formula]. In all such cases the generating function of the canonical transformation for the canonical fields is of the type S2 and more precisely is realized by the 4 - scalar function:

[formula]

with fμνdenoting a smooth real tensor function satisfying the Hessian condition [formula].

For completeness, it is worth mentioning the corresponding Poisson-bracket conditions holding for arbitrary continuum canonical transformations. In this case it is immediate to prove that, based on the validity of Eqs.([\ref=CAN-1]) and ([\ref=CAN-2]), the following fundamental Poisson brackets must hold identically for the transformed canonical state XR:

[formula]

Notice that in such a case the customary canonical invariance of the Poisson brackets holds, namely for arbitrary canonical variables xR and XR mutually connected by a symplectic transformation, the identity

[formula]

applies for arbitrary differentiable tensor fields A and B.

A further notable application of the theory of canonical transformations of the type considered here which are generated by coordinate transformations of the type given by Eqs.([\ref=rt]) and ([\ref=rt-2]) is represented by the canonical flow xR(so)  →  xR(s) associated with the canonical evolution equation ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]). More precisely, one can show that the map

[formula]

is canonical and again is generated by a mixed-variable generating function of the type ([\ref=ppt]). The proof follows equivalently either noting that the two states xR(so) and xR(s) mapped in each other by the canonical flow both fulfill by construction the canonical evolution equation and hence are manifestly canonical, or by noting that the two states satisfy identically the fundamental Poisson brackets

[formula]

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the transformation such that

[formula]

is manifestly non-canonical and therefore remains excluded from the present treatment. In fact, consistent with the conclusions pointed out in subsection 3D, the collapsed state can only be regarded as canonical in the limit sense.

5 - Manifestly-covariant Hamilton-Jacobi theory

From the results established in the previous sections, it follows that thanks to the LP-parametrization the GR-Hamilton equations take the form of dynamical evolution equations. More precisely they are parametrized in terms of the proper-time s characteristic of the geodetics belonging to the background space-time. This feature is necessarily inherited by the theory of canonical transformations developed in Section 5. Given these premises, in this section the problem of constructing a Hamilton-Jacobi theory of GR is addressed. Such a theory should describe a dynamical flow connecting a generic phase-space state with a suitable initial phase-space state characterized by identically-vanishing (i.e., stationary with respect to s) coordinate fields and momenta. In view of the similarity of the LP formalism for GR with classical mechanics, it is expected that also in the present context the Hamilton-Jacobi theory follows from constructing a symplectic canonical transformation associated with the mixed-variable generating function of type [formula].

Accordingly, by construction, the transformed canonical state XR must satisfy the constraint equations

[formula]

which imply the Hamilton equations

[formula]

where [formula] is the transformed Hamiltonian given by

[formula]

Thanks to Eqs.([\ref=PB-11]) and ([\ref=PB-127]), the transformed Hamiltonian is necessarily independent of XR. As a consequence, KR identifies an arbitrary gauge function, i.e., in actual fact [formula], which can always be set equal to zero (KR = 0). On the other hand, invoking for πμν the representation given by Eq.([\ref=CAN-1]) and introducing the s - parametrization it follows that the previous equation delivers

[formula]

which realizes the GR-Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the mixed-variable generating function

[formula]

Due to its similarity with the customary Hamilton-Jacobi equation well-known in Hamiltonian classical dynamics, in the following S will be referred to as the (classical) GR-Hamilton principal function. Besides Eq.([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]), the canonical transformations generated by [formula] are obtained by recalling Eqs.([\ref=CAN-1])-([\ref=CAN-2]) and are explicitly provided by the following equations:

[formula]

Now we notice, in view of the discussions given above, that the inverse canonical transformation XR  →  xR locally exists provided the invertibility condition on the Hessian determinant [formula] is met. Under such a condition the direct canonical equations ([\ref=R2-2]) determine gβγ as an implicit function of the form [formula].

Let us now investigate the relationship between the GR-Hamilton-Jacobi and the GR-Hamilton equations. The following statement holds in this regard.

THM.1 - Equivalence of GR-Hamilton and GR-Hamilton-Jacobi equations

The GR-Hamilton-Jacobi equation ([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]) subject to the constraint ([\ref=R1-1]) is equivalent to the set of GR-Hamilton equations expressed in terms of the initial canonical variables, as given by Eqs.([\ref=reduced_CONTINUUM_HAMILTON_EQ]).

Proof - Without loss of generality and avoiding possible misunderstandings, the compact notation [formula] will be used in the following proof to denote the GR-Hamilton principal function. To start with, we evaluate first the partial derivative of Eq.([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]) with respect to gik, keeping both [formula] and rμ constant. This gives

[formula]

Then, let us evaluate in a similar manner the partial derivative with respect to [formula], keeping gμν and rμ constant. This gives

[formula]

With the identification [formula] provided by Eq.([\ref=R1-1]) it follows that Eq.([\ref=first-hjh]) becomes

[formula]

To prove also the validity of the Hamilton equation for gβγ we first invoke the following identity

[formula]

where

[formula]

The first term on the rhs of Eq.([\ref=ts]) vanishes identically because [formula] must be considered as independent of πik. Therefore, Eq.([\ref=second-hjh]) gives

[formula]

which coincides with the Hamilton equation for gik and gives also the relationship of the generalized velocity [formula] with the canonical momentum, since here no explicit s - dependence appears. This proves the equivalence between the GR-Hamilton-Jacobi and GR-Hamilton equations.

Q.E.D.

This conclusion recovers the relationship between Hamilton and Hamilton-Jacobi equations holding in Hamiltonian Classical Mechanics for discrete dynamical systems. The connection is established also in the present case for the continuum gravitational field thanks to the manifestly-covariant LP parametrization of the theory and the representation of the Hamiltonian and Hamilton-Jacobi equations as dynamical evolution equations with respect to the proper time s characterizing background geodetics. The physical interpretation which follows from the validity of THM.1 is remarkable. This concerns the meaning of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory in providing a wave mechanics description of the continuum Hamiltonian dynamics. This follows also in the present context by comparing the mathematical structure of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation ([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]) with the well-known eikonal equation of geometrical optics. In fact Eq.([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]) contains the squared of the derivative [formula], so that the Hamilton principal function [formula] is associated with the eikonal (i.e., the phase of the wave), while the remaining contributions due to the geometrical and physical properties of the curved space-time formally play the role of a non-uniform index of refraction in geometrical optics [\cite=Goldstein]. The issue will be further investigated in Section 8, where the problem of stability of vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations will be addressed by introducing an eikonal representation for the variational fields (see in particular Eq.([\ref=eiko]) below). The outcome pointed out here proves that the dynamics of the field gμν(s) in the virtual domain of variational fields where the Hamiltonian structure is defined and the Hamilton-Jacobi theory ([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]) applies must be characterized by a wave-like behavior and can therefore be given a geometrical optics interpretation. This feature is expected to be crucial for the establishment of the corresponding manifestly-covariant quantum theory of the gravitational field.

An important qualitative feature must be pointed out regarding the Hamilton-Jacobi theory developed here. This refers to a formal difference arising between the Hamilton-Jacobi theory for continuum fields built on the DeDonder-Weyl covariant approach and the Hamilton-Jacobi theory holding in classical mechanics for particle dynamics. This concerns, more precisely, the dimensional units to be adopted for the Hamilton principal function S and hence also the canonical momentum πμν. Indeed, as is well-known, in particle dynamics S retains the dimension of an action (and therefore of the action functional), so that [formula]. In the present case instead (see Eq.([\ref=reduced_HAMILTONIAN])) one has that [formula], namely the dimension of S differs from that of an action by the cubic length L- 3. This arises because for continuum fields the action functional is an integral over the 4 - volume element of the Hamiltonian density, while for particle mechanics it is expressed as a line integral over the proper-time length. One has to notice, however, that first the dimensions of S may be changed by the introduction of a non-symplectic canonical transformation. This means that, by suitable choice of the same transformation, S can actually recover the dimension of an action. Second, the relationship between the Hamilton principal function S and the Hamiltonian function itself remains in all cases the same, with the two functions differing by the dimension of a length. These features will be addressed in detail in Section 7.

Before concluding, the following additional remarks are in order:

1) The GR-Hamilton-Jacobi description permits to construct explicitly canonical transformations mapping in each other the physical and virtual domains. The generating function determined by the GR-Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a real 4 - scalar field.

2) The generating function obtained in this way realizes the particular subset of canonical transformations which map the physically-observable state x̂R into a neighboring admissible virtual canonical state xR.

3) The virtue of the approach is that it preserves the validity of the Einstein equation in the physical domain. In other words, the canonical transformations do not affect the physical behavior.

4) The GR-Hamilton-Jacobi and the GR-Hamilton canonical equations are equivalent and manifestly covariant. Both recover the standard form of the Einstein equation when the extremal xR collapses to x̂R. In this sense, the GR-Hamilton-Jacobi equation realizes a 4 - scalar PDE whose solution is equivalent in the virtual domain to a set of tensor PDEs (the Hamilton equations), and on the physical domain to the tensor Einstein equation which can be obtained by collapsing the canonical equations on x̂R.

5) Finally, one notices that based on the extended Hamilton equations for GR recalled in Section 2, formally it is possible to introduce an analogous Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the corresponding extended canonical state (gμν,Παμν) and the transformed state (Gμν,Pαμν). The main steps of this procedure are summarized in Appendix A.

6 - Properties of CHS

In this section some properties of crucial importance are discussed which characterize the Hamiltonian theory for SF-GR developed here.

Global prescription and regularity

This refers, first of all, to the global prescription and regularity of the GR-Lagrangian and GR-Hamiltonian densities [formula] and [formula] defined according to Eqs.([\ref=reduced-lagrangian]) and ([\ref=reduced_HAMILTONIAN]) which are associated with the corresponding Hamiltonian structure [formula] indicated above. For this purpose we notice that in Eq.([\ref=reduced-lagrangian]) the effective kinetic and potential energy densities expressed in terms of the Lagrangian state [formula] and the LP-parametrization ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]) can be taken of the general type

[formula]

Here according to the notations introduced above (see Section 2) f(h) and σ identify two distinct multiplicative gauge functions which remain in principle still arbitrary at this point. The rest of the notations is expressed in standard form (see Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2]). More precisely, in the second equation

[formula]

coincide respectively with the gravitational and external-field source contributions to the effective potential energy introduced in Ref.[\cite=noi1], the field Lagrangian [formula] being prescribed according to the same reference. Furthermore, [formula] identifies the generic form of the effective kinetic energy density. In addition, κ is the dimensional constant [formula] with G being the universal gravitational constant, Λ is the cosmological constant, while R̂μν identifies the Ricci tensor evaluated in terms of the prescribed metric tensor qμν(r). It follows that a sufficient condition for the global prescription of the canonical state, i.e., the existence of a smooth bijection connecting the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian states is the so-called regularity condition of the GR-Hamiltonian (and corresponding GR-Lagrangian) density. This requires more precisely that in the whole Hamiltonian phase-space

[formula]

Gauge indeterminacies of CHS

As shown in Ref.[\cite=noi2] at the classical level the Hamiltonian structure [formula] of SF-GR remains intrinsically non-unique, with the Hamiltonian density HR being characterized by suitable gauge indeterminacies. Leaving aside the treatment of additive gauge functions earlier discussed in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2], these refer more precisely to the following two properties:

A) The first one is the so-called multiplicative gauge transformation of the effective kinetic energy density. To identify it we notice that the scalar factor f(h) appearing in the prescriptions of the effective kinetic energy density (see first equation in ([\ref=kin-energy-density])) remains in principle essentially indeterminate. In fact the regularity condition ([\ref=Hessian-1]) requires only that

[formula]

implying that the function f(h) can be realized by an arbitrary non-vanishing (for example, strictly positive) and suitably smooth dimensionless real function. In addition, in order that both [formula] and [formula] (see again Eqs.([\ref=kin-energy-density])) should be realized by means of integrable functions in the configurations space Ug, so that accordingly the functions f(h) and 1 / f(h) should be summable too. As a consequence the prescription of f(h) remains in principle still free within the classical theory of SF-GR developed in Section 2. This means that f(h) should be intended in such a context as a gauge indeterminacy affecting the Hamiltonian density HR, i.e., with respect to the multiplicative gauge transformation

[formula]

with f(h) being the multiplicative 4 - scalar gauge function introduced in Section 2.

B) The second indeterminacy is related to the so-called multiplicative gauge transformation of the effecting potential density. [formula] (see again Section 2). More precisely the indeterminacy is related to the constant gauge factor ([\ref=constant_gauge_function]).

C) The third indeterminacy is related to the so-called additive gauge transformation. Indeed, one can readily show (see Ref.[\cite=noi2]) that LR(y,q,s) is prescribed up to an arbitrary additive gauge transformation of the type

[formula]

being ΔV a gauge scalar field of the form

[formula]

with F(g,q,s) an arbitrary, suitably-smooth real gauge function of class C() with respect to the variables (g,s) (see also related discussion in Ref.[\cite=noi1]). Indeed, in terms of the Euler-Lagrange operator it is immediate noticing that by construction

[formula]

is a gauge function since denoting

[formula]

it follows identically

[formula]

Thus denoting

[formula]

consider now the corresponding Hamiltonian density

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the 4 - tensor transformed canonical momentum. Then it follows that the gauge-transformed Hamiltonian density is

[formula]

while the Hamilton equations for the corresponding gauge-transformed Hamiltonian structure [formula] namely

[formula]

become explicitly

[formula]

Extended covariance property of CHS

As a third issue, let us now analyze the validity of a Principle of Extended Covariance for the classical Hamiltonian structure [formula] More, precisely let us show that the GR-Hamilton equations prescribed in terms of the reduced canonical state xR (see Eqs.([\ref=canonical_evolution_equations_-2])) are covariant with respect to the group of non-local point transformations (the NLPT-group) which map in each other in principle two different curved space-times [formula] and [formula].

To prove the statement it is sufficient to consider, without loss of generality, the case of special NLPTs (see Ref.[\cite=noi4]) which realize the so called Einstein's teleparallel transformation. Such a transformation, denoted here in a short-way as teleparallel special NLPT (see Appendix B for details), maps in each other an in principle arbitrary curved space-time [formula] onto a Minkowski flat space-time [formula].

The extended covariance property, in fact, can be readily established by showing that such a coordinate transformation actually can be realized by means of a suitably-prescribed canonical transformation. In particular, as shown by Eqs.([\ref=NLPT-tensor-1]) and ([\ref=NLPT-tensor-2]) in Appendix B, it follows that both the coordinates [formula] and the conjugate momenta [formula] satisfy as a consequence well-defined NLPT-tensor transformation laws.

Incidentally, the same conclusion can also be reached on a purely heuristic and intuitive basis. In fact it is obvious that, by construction, the GR-Hamilton equations ([\ref=canonical_evolution_equations_-2]) necessarily hold for arbitrary possible realization of the prescribed metric tensor [formula], i.e., of the background space-time [formula]. In other words, is must always be possible to realize the GR-Hamilton equations for arbitrary background space-times. This means also that a suitable canonical transformation should exist which realizes the action of arbitrary NLPTs mapping in each other thee same space-times.

Normalization of CHS

Finally, the issue is to show that the Hamiltonian structure [formula] can be equivalently realized in such a way that x, and consequently also HR, can be suitably normalized, i.e., so that to achieve prescribed physical dimensions. Granted the non-symplectic canonical nature of the transformation indicated above (i.e., Eq.([\ref=CANONICAL-0])) one can always identify the 4 - scalar α with a classical invariant parameter, i.e., both frame-independent and space-time independent. In particular, in the framework of a classical treatment it should be identified with the classical parameter [formula] being

[formula]

with c being the speed of light in vacuum, mo a suitable rest-mass to be later identified with the non-vanishing graviton mass (see Section 9) and L a characteristic scale length to be considered as an invariant non-null 4 - scalar. Without loss of generality this can always be assumed of the form

[formula]

with mo itself being regarded as an invariant 4 - scalar. Here L is regarded as a classical invariant parameter, so that it should remain independent of all quantum parameters, i.e., in particular [formula]. In addition, in view of the extended covariance property of the theory, whereby the choice of the background space-time [formula] is in principle arbitrary, the 4 - scalars mo and L should be universal constants, namely also invariant with respect to the action of the NLPT-group. As an example, a possible consistent choice for the invariant function L(mo) is realized by means of the so-called Schwarzschild radius, i.e.,

[formula]

The invariant rest-mass mo remains however still arbitrary at this level, its prescription being left to quantum theory (see below). It follows that the transformed GR-Hamilton equations ([\ref=canonical_evolution_equations_-2]) can always be cast in the normalized form

[formula]

where the transformed Hamiltonian [formula], again of the type ([\ref=CANONICAL-0]), identifies the normalized GR-Hamiltonian density

[formula]

Here the notation is as follows. First, for an arbitrary curved space-time [formula] the functions [formula] and [formula] now are identified with

[formula]

so that [formula] identifies the normalized effective kinetic energy density and [formula] by analogy is the corresponding normalized effective potential energy density, with [formula] and [formula] now being prescribed respectively in terms of [formula] and [formula] as

[formula]

Hence, in particular

[formula]

in the case of the flat Minkowski space-time [formula]. From the canonical equation ([\ref=can-2-a]) it is obvious that by construction the transformed canonical momentum [formula] takes the dimensions of an action, i.e., [formula]. The set [formula] thus provides an admissible representation of CHS. In particular it follows that the GR-Hamilton equations in normalized form become respectively

[formula]

and

[formula]

for a generic curved space-time and for the flat Minkowski space-time respectively. The operator D / Ds is prescribed again in terms of the corresponding prescribed metric tensors qμν(r) and ημν respectively. Hence, this means in particular that in the second case D / Ds must coincide with the ordinary derivative operator d / ds.

For completeness, we mention here also the normalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to the canonical equations given above ([\ref=RENORM-HAM;]). This is reached introducing the corresponding normalized Hamilton principal function S(g,P,q,r,s), i.e., the mixed-variable generating function for the canonical transformation

[formula]

with [formula] denoting the initial canonical GR-state. Then, [formula] is prescribed in such a way that the normalized canonical momentum πμν(s) is given by

[formula]

while the initial canonical coordinate [formula] is determined by the inverse canonical transformations:

[formula]

It follows that the corresponding normalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation which is equivalent to Eqs.([\ref=RENORM-HAM;]) is provided by

[formula]

with [formula] being prescribed by Eqs.([\ref=HAmiltonian-N]). Instead, the corresponding normalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation holding in case of the flat Minkowski space-time and hence equivalent to Eqs.([\ref=RENORM-HAM;-VACUUM]) is simply given by

[formula]

7 - Statistical theory and classical GR-hydrodynamic equations

Let us analyze the physical implications arising from the reduced Hamiltonian formulation.

As earlier pointed out in Ref.[\cite=noi2], the Hamiltonian theory of GR exhibits a intuitive analogy with the so-called induced gravity (or emergent gravity), namely the conjecture that the geometrical properties of space-time reveal themselves as a sort of "mean field" description of a microscopic structure underlying the classical solution and emerging from a suitable stochastic background. This feature arises because of the role played by the prescribed metric tensor [formula] which is held fixed in the variational principles when performing synchronous variations. Hence, this means that the tensor field [formula] which is associated with the background space-time has to be effectively considered as deterministic, i.e., as a classical observable. Its role has therefore to be distinguished from that of the variational fields which in the reduced Hamiltonian formulation are provided by the parametrized tensor fields [formula] and [formula].

However a key issue remains to be addressed, i.e., the determination of the precise connection between the same prescribed metric tensor [formula] and the variational state [formula] spanning the Hamiltonian phase-space Γx = Ug  ×  Uπ, with [formula] and [formula] being the corresponding configuration and momentum spaces. In fact, by construction any canonical initial state [formula], with [formula], which is different for the extremal one, namely [formula], is necessarily non-stationary since it fulfills the Hamilton equations ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]), so that generally

[formula]

The relationship indicated above can, however, be obtained by establishing a proper statistical theory. This is achieved by considering the initial state

[formula]

as a stochastic tensor and thus endowed with a suitable phase-space probability density (PDF), to be referred to here as classical stochastic PDF. Let us require for definiteness that such a PDF is prescribed at the initial proper time so requiring

[formula]

with po(xR(so),x̂(so)) being a suitable strictly-positive initial condition for the same PDF, i.e., defined so that

[formula]

being dxR(so) = dg(so)dμ(so) the canonical measure defined on the Hamiltonian phase-space Γx. Notice that here

[formula]

provide respectively the Eulerian and Lagrangian representations of the same PDF. The proper time evolved state xR(s), namely the image of the initial canonical state xR(so) generated by the flow determined Eqs.([\ref=canonical_evolution_equations_-2]), is of course stochastic too. The prescription of the corresponding phase-space PDF can immediately be obtained by noting that the phase-space measure dxR(s) satisfies by construction identically (i.e., for all [formula]) the Liouville theorem

[formula]

Hence, the PDF [formula] can uniquely be prescribed in such a way to obey identically the integral Liouville equation for the PDF written in Lagrangian form

[formula]

or equivalently the corresponding Eulerian differential Liouville equation, namely

[formula]

Notice that the PDF p(xR,s) and the same Liouville equation ([\ref=LIOUVILLE_Eq-2]) can also be conveniently realized in terms of the gauge-transformed Hamiltonian structure [formula] introduced above in Section 6 (see Eq.([\ref=classical-gauge-2])), thus yielding in such a case

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] being prescribed by Eqs.([\ref=GAUGE-TRANSF-CANONICAL_MOM]) and ([\ref=GAUGE-TRANSF-HAMILTONIAN]). Considering for definiteness the second case, one notices that [formula] can always be taken of the form

[formula]

Here [formula] [formula] is the stochastic tensor field

[formula]

where in particular gμν  =  qμν(s) + δgμν,πμν  =  μν(s) + δπμν and [formula]. Thus, a possible statistical prescription of the extremal state [formula] is realized by the requirement that the following constraint equations hold

[formula]

with [formula] being an in principle arbitrary additive real gauge function not depending explicitly on s. Now we notice that Eqs.([\ref=A-1]) are actually constraints equations on the PDF p(δxR,x̂(s),s). Therefore, as such they are assumed to be satisfied by construction, i.e., by suitable prescription of p(δxR,x̂(s),s). Nevertheless, the first equation in ([\ref=A-1]) manifestly demands that

[formula]

must hold identically. In addition, one may demand also that the phase-space integral

[formula]

satisfies similarly the further constraint equation

[formula]

Let us invoke for definiteness hereon the requirement f(h) = 1. Then it is immediate to show the first constraint ([\ref=CONSTR-1]) is fulfilled identically thanks to the validity of Eqs.([\ref=A-1]). In fact from ([\ref=CONSTR-1]) one obtains

[formula]

while thanks to the Liouville equation

[formula]

Thus integration by parts and validity of the second equation in ([\ref=A-1]) deliver identically

[formula]

Consider now the second constraint equation ([\ref=CONSTR-2]). Thanks to Eq.([\ref=previous-2]), it requires

[formula]

Thus, invoking Eq.([\ref=GAUGE-TRANSF-HAMILTONIAN]) for the gauge-transformed Hamiltonian density [formula], the second Hamilton equation in ([\ref=GAUGE-TRANSFORMED-HAM-EQ]) implies the additional constraint equation

[formula]

One can show that the gauge function F(g,q,r) can always be properly selected in such a way to warrant validity of Eq. ([\ref=A-2]). To determine explicitly the gauge function F(g,q,r) let us identify here, for the sake of illustration, the effective external potential [formula] with the function

[formula]

Then, one can show that a possible non-unique realization of the additive gauge function F = F(g,q,r) is provided by the decomposition

[formula]

where respectively K(q,r),K1(q,r),K2(q,r) and B̂ij(q,r) are suitable 4 - scalars and a 4 - tensor. More precisely:

The product K1(q,r)K(q,r) is selected so that

[formula]

The scalars K(q,r), K2(r) and the tensor B̂ij(q,r) are prescribed so that

[formula]

From these considerations it follows that Eqs.([\ref=A-1]) do indeed provide the required statistical relationship between the variational state ([formula]) and the prescribed state x̂(s). The conclusion is that an arbitrary variational state xR(s) should be interpreted as a stochastic tensor field endowed with the stochastic PDF p(xR,s), while - on the other hand - the extremal (i.e., prescribed) state x̂(s) can be identified with its corresponding stochastic expectation value uniquely determined by means of the stochastic averages indicated above, i.e., Eqs.([\ref=A-1]).

As a further implication, we notice that in terms of the Liouville equation ([\ref=LIOUVILLE_Eq-2]) an, in principle, infinite set of corresponding hydrodynamic equations can be obtained in terms of moments of the canonical momentum πμν, i.e., weighted integrals performed on the canonical momentum space Uπ with respect to tensor functions of the form X = X(xR,x̂(s),s). Thus, for example, the first two moments, corresponding to the weight factors X = 1,πμν, deliver the two classical GR-hydrodynamic equations

[formula]

[formula]

to be denoted respectively as classical GR-continuity and GR-Euler equations. Here ρ(c)(g,s) identifies in particular the configuration-space PDF associated with the variational tensor field [formula], namely the moment

[formula]

and, provided ρ(c)(s) is strictly positive, the two additional ones

[formula]

which identify respectively the tensor "velocity" and "pressure" fluid fields. This implies that the variational tensor field [formula] can be interpreted as a stochastic function endowed with a configuration-space stochastic PDF to be identified with the classical configuration-space probability densityρ(c)(g,s), which is advanced in proper time by means of the same continuity equation. Notice that on similar grounds the tensor Euler equation ([\ref=CLASICAL_EULER_EQUATION]) determines the tensor velocity field V(c)αβ(g,s). Hence, provided the phase-space PDF p(xR,s) is known, in the same equation the tensor pressure P(c)αβμν(g,s) is uniquely determined by Eq.([\ref=CLASSICAL_TENSOR_PRESSURE]), to be therefore viewed as a statistical closure condition. As a final point, it is immediate to show that the phase-space PDF p(xR,s) solution of the Liouville equation ([\ref=LIOUVILLE_Eq-2]) must conserve also the associated statistical entropy, the latter being identified with the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy. In fact, let us assume for definiteness that the initial PDF the initial PDF p(xRo,so) prescribed by Eq.([\ref=initiual_condition]) is strictly positive and that the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy functional

[formula]

exists. Then Liouville theorem ([\ref=Liouviulle_YHM]) and the integral Liouville equation ([\ref=LIOUVILLE_Eq-1]) warrant that for arbitrary s,so∈I the conservation law (GR-constant H-theorem)

[formula]

is necessarily fulfilled. In other words, the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy is conserved by the continuum Hamiltonian structure [formula] just as it occurs in the case of discrete Hamiltonian systems as well as in inverse statistical treatments of quantum systems [\cite=FoP2].

8 - Application: stability of vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations

In this section we present an application of the reduced Hamiltonian theory developed in this paper. This concerns the stability of the equilibrium solutions x̂R(s) of the canonical evolution equations ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]) and therefore the stability of the Einstein field equations themselves. For definiteness, here we shall consider the case of vacuum solutions of the same equations, with the inclusion of the cosmological constant contribution.

Let us address the problem in the context of the reduced continuum manifestly-covariant Hamiltonian theory. The issue lies in the investigation of the stability of the equilibria x̂R(s) in the context of the same canonical evolution equations. This study is supported by the conclusions pointed out above concerning the wave mechanics interpretation of the reduced continuum Hamiltonian dynamics of the gravitational field determined by the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. For this purpose we shall consider perturbations of the reduced canonical state xR(s) which are suitably close to x̂R(s), namely of the form

[formula]

where ε  ≪  1 is an infinitesimal dimensionless parameter identifying the perturbations of the canonical fields. In particular, consistent with the existence of a Hamilton-Jacobi theory and its physical interpretation pointed out above, we are authorized to consider a wave-like form of the perturbations. These are assumed to propagate along field geodetics, namely the same perturbations of the canonical fields [formula] are taken of the form

[formula]

Here G(s) denotes the eikonal

[formula]

with ω and K being 4 - scalar parameters which, by construction, have respectively the dimensions of a frequency and that of a wave number (i.e., the inverse of a length). Therefore, denoting [formula], according to the representation ([\ref=eiko]), ω and λ identify the invariant frequency and wave-length of the wave-like perturbations of the canonical fields. The invariant character of ω and λarises therefore as a characteristic feature of the manifestly-covariant Hamiltonian theory.

It is then immediate to show that, in terms of the canonical evolution equations ([\ref=LP-PARAMETRIZED_REDUCED_HAM-EQ]), the following set of linear differential equations advancing in proper time the perturbed fields δgμν(s) and δπμν(s) and accurate through [formula] is obtained thanks also to the requirement ([\ref=COINSTRAIUNT_ON_f(h)]):

[formula]

In particular, introducing the representation ([\ref=eiko]) and recalling the definition of the differential operator [formula], the first equation yields the following relationship between δπμν(s) and δgμν(s):

[formula]

Then, Eq.([\ref=seconda]) determines the algebraic linear equation for [formula]:

[formula]

To solve it explicitly one needs to determine the corresponding algebraic equations holding for the independent tensor products qμν(s)δgαβR̂αβ and qαβ(s)δgαβR̂μν appearing on the rhs of the same equation. Thus, by first multiplying tensorially term by term Eq.([\ref=single_equation_for_the_perturbation]) by R̂μνit follows:

[formula]

namely

[formula]

Next, multiplying tensorially term by term Eq.([\ref=single_equation_for_the_perturbation]) by [formula] one obtains instead:

[formula]

which requires necessarily

[formula]

Combining together equations ([\ref=second_single_equationm]) and ([\ref=third_single_equation]) one is finally left with the equation

[formula]

which identifies the dispersion relation between ω and K, i.e., the condition under which in the context for the reduced continuum Hamiltonian theory the infinitesimal perturbations ([\ref=PERT-1]) and ([\ref=PERT-2]) can occur.

To analyze in terms of Eq.([\ref=DISPERSION_RELATION]) the conditions for the existence of stable, marginally stable or unstable oscillatory solutions for the canonical fields [formula], it is convenient to classify the possible complex roots for ω which can locally occur. Such a classification has therefore necessarily a local character. More precisely, single roots of this equation such that locally a) Im(ω) < 0, b) Im(ω) = 0 or c) Im(ω) > 0 will be referred to as (locally) stable, marginally stable and unstable respectively. Correspondingly, the perturbation [formula] will be classified to be locally a) decaying, b) oscillatory; c) growing. Therefore, the equilibrium solution q(r) will be denoted as a) locally stable, b) locally marginally stable and c) locally unstable respectively if:

a) all roots of ω are locally stable: namely for them Im(ω) < 0;

b) there is at least one root of ω which is locally marginally stable, namely such that Im(ω) = 0;

c) there is at least one locally unstable root of ω, namely such that Im(ω) > 0.

To investigate the stability problem let us invoke the configuration reported by Eqs.([\ref=RESULT-VACUUM-EINST]). Then Eq.([\ref=DISPERSION_RELATION]) yields the dispersion relation in the explicit form

[formula]

which delivers the roots

[formula]

Therefore, two possible alternatives can be distinguished in which respectively:

A) First case: -  σΛ  ≥  0. Then the equilibrium solution q(r) is marginally stable since all roots of the dispersion relation ([\ref=DISPERSION_RELATION-2]) have vanishing imaginary part.

B) Second case: -  σΛ < 0. Then q(r) is necessarily unstable (there exists always an unstable root of the same equation ([\ref=DISPERSION_RELATION-2])).

In practice this means that stability depends on the still undetermined multiplicative gauge parameter σ appearing in the definition of the effective potential energy density V (see the second equation given above in ([\ref=V_R-N])). The suggestion may be advanced that in the framework of classical GR a possible prescription for the gauge parameter σ should correspond to case A), i.e., σ =  - 1 if the cosmological constant Λ is taken as positive as frequently invoked in the literature (see for example [\cite=Einstein1917] [\cite=Winberg2000] [\cite=Carroll2004]). Nevertheless, the validity of such a choice remains a mere conjecture at this point since its justification should actually follow from quantum theory. The issue will be further discussed in Part 2.

9 - Conclusions

The problem of determining the Hamiltonian structure associated with the Einstein equations has been investigated for a long time in the literature. Previous attempts share the common feature of being based on non-manifestly covariant approaches, the primary reason for such an occurrence being related to the adoption of asynchronous variational principles. However, as shown in Ref.[\cite=noi2], a manifestly covariant Hamiltonian theory for the Einstein equations can be achieved when a so-called synchronous variational principle expressed in superabundant canonical variables is introduced.

Nevertheless, a common fundamental theoretical aspect laying at the foundation of both General Relativity (GR) and classical field theory is the variational character of the fundamental dynamical laws which identify these disciplines. This concerns both the representation of the Einstein field equations and the covariant dynamics of classical fields as well as of discrete (e.g., test particles) or continuum systems in curved space-time. Issues related to the variational formulation of the Einstein equations have been treated in Refs.[\cite=noi1] [\cite=noi2], where the existence of a privileged type of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian variational approaches has been identified in terms of synchronous variational principles realized in the framework of the DeDonder-Weyl formalism.

In this paper new aspects of the Hamiltonian structure of GR have been displayed. In particular, we have shown that:

A reduced-dimensional realization of the continuum Hamiltonian theory for the Einstein field equations actually exists in which both generalized coordinates and corresponding conjugate momenta are realized by means of 2nd-order 4 - tensors.

A causal form has been obtained for the corresponding continuum Hamilton equations by introducing a suitable Lagrangian parametrization prescribed in terms of the proper-time s defined along field geodetics of the curved space-time. As a result, it turns out that the same equations are cast in the equivalent form of an initial-value problem for suitable canonical evolution equations. This provides a physical interpretation for the reduced Hamiltonian theory, according to which an arbitrary initial canonical state is dynamically advanced by means of the canonical flow generated by the same Hamilton equations.

The notion of canonical transformation theory associated with the same canonical evolution equations has been introduced. In particular, the classification of canonical transformations in terms of the mixed-variable generating functions and their invertibility conditions have been discussed. As an application, the validity has been pointed out of the extended covariance property of the GR-Hamilton equations with respect to the group of non-local point transformations.  The reference case considered here concerns the so-called Einstein's teleparallel problem, namely the non-local point transformation which maps mutually in each other an in principle arbitrary curved space-time [formula] and the Minkowski flat space-time [formula] (see Ref.[\cite=noi4]).

The special case has been considered of the canonical transformations which generate the flow corresponding to the continuum canonical equations. This has been obtained by introducing the appropriate mixed-variable generating function - the so-called Hamilton principal function - and by developing the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi theory. As a result, the same generating function has been shown to obey a 4 - scalar continuum Hamilton-Jacobi equation which has been proved to be equivalent to the corresponding canonical evolution equations of the Hamiltonian theory.

The global prescription and regularity of CHS have been analyzed and the gauge transformation properties of the reduced Hamiltonian density HR have been pointed out. In addition, the covariance properties of the GR-Hamilton equations with respect to the group on non-local point transformations have been pointed out as well as the normalized form of CHS and the corresponding realization of the GR-Hamilton equations.

A statistical relationship between the variational and extremal states xR(s) and x̂R(s) has been established which provides the interpretation of the variational state xR(s) in terms of a stochastic tensor field and x̂R(s) as its classical expectation value. This feature permits also the determination of a suitable set of GR-hydrodynamic equations, which include in particular the GR-continuity and Euler equations and a constant H-theorem for the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy.

Finally, the ultimate result to be mentioned concerns the application of the Hamiltonian theory developed here for the stability of arbitrary vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. As shown here, depending on the specific realization of the space-time [formula], vacuum solutions may correspond to stable solutions provided the cosmological constant Λ is non-vanishing.

These conclusions highlight the major key features of the reduced Hamiltonian theory and corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation determined here. The new theory, besides being a mandatory prerequisite for the covariant theory of quantum gravity to be established in Part 2, is believed to be susceptible of applications to physics and astrophysics-related problems and to provide at the same time new insight in the axiomatic foundations of General Relativity.

Appendix A: Extended continuum Hamilton-Jacobi equation

From the results established in Ref.[\cite=noi2] and the analysis developed above, it follows that the continuum Hamilton-Jacobi theory can in principle be established also in terms of the extended Hamilton equations (see Eqs.([\ref=CANONICAL-E-L])). The corresponding formulation identifies the extended continuum Hamilton-Jacobi theory [\cite=sym9], realized here for the gravitational field. This result follows as a direct consequence of the prescription provided by Eqs.([\ref=REALIZATION-1]) and ([\ref=REALIZATION-2]) which establish the relationship between the extended and reduced canonical momenta Παμν and πμν respectively. Thus, recalling the standard relationship between the reduced canonical momentum πμν and the corresponding Hamilton principal function [formula] (see Eq.([\ref=R1-1])), thanks again to Eqs.([\ref=REALIZATION-1]) and ([\ref=REALIZATION-2]) and the fact that the 4 - vector tα(s) is by definition independent of the variational field gμν, it follows that the extended canonical momentum is given by

[formula]

where the 4 - vector tensor field

[formula]

identifies now the extended Hamilton principal function. We notice that, by construction, in the extended formulation the LP parametrization does not apply anymore. Hence, the function Sα depends on the extended state x̂, the 4 - position [formula] and the transformed momentum Pαμν which belongs to the transformed extended canonical state [formula]. Thanks to the validity of the GR- Hamilton-Jacobi equation ([\ref=AA-REDUCED-HJ]) it then follows that Sα by construction must identically satisfy the PDE

[formula]

to be referred to as extended Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Finally, a theorem equivalent to THM.1 can also be established in order to prove the equivalence between the extended continuum Hamilton and Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

Appendix B - Validity of the extended covariance principle - Case of Einstein's teleparallel transformation problem

As shown in Ref.[\cite=noi4] the Einstein's teleparallel problem (TT-Problem) involves the construction of a NLPT mapping two space-times, respectively an in principle arbitrary curved space-time [formula] endowed with a metric tensor [formula] and the Minkowski flat space-time [formula] with corresponding metric tensor [formula] represented in terms of general curvilinear coordinates [formula]. In particular it is obvious that in both cases the coordinates [formula] and [formula] can be represented, without loss of generality, in terms of orthogonal Cartesian coordinates. Then, introducing - according to Ref.[\cite=noi4] - a special NLPT of the form

[formula]

with Mμ(g)ν and [formula] denoting respectively the corresponding Jacobian matrix and its inverse, the latter must be determined so that identically

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=implication-2]) is therefore a particular possible realization of the continuous-coordinate transformation mapping in each other the variational metric tensors [formula], namely

[formula]

This is obtained upon identifying in the present case

[formula]

It is now readily shown that Eqs.([\ref=rtA]) and in particular Eqs.([\ref=rt-1]) can be realized by means of a canonical transformation of the type

[formula]

with πμν(r) and [formula] denoting the corresponding conjugate momenta. Indeed it is immediate to show that this is realized by means of the canonical transformation generated by means of a generating function of the form

[formula]

with fμν denoting a smooth real tensor function satisfying the Hessian condition [formula] and G(s) being a suitable real 4 - scalar to be assumed a local function of s only. Such a transformation will be denoted here as teleparallel special NLPT. In detail, for this purpose:

First, let us identify the tensor function [formula] in terms of Eq.([\ref=rt-1]).

Second, let us identify the canonical state and the corresponding Hamiltonian density with the normalized state and normalized GR-Hamiltonian density [formula]. The latter is thus defined in terms of the corresponding normalized effective kinetic and potential energy densities [formula] and [formula] The corresponding canonical equations are therefore expressed in terms of the equations

[formula]

and the transformed ones

[formula]

pertaining respectively to the curved space-time [formula] and the Minkowski flat space-time [formula]. Notice in particular that here

[formula]

identifies the transformed Hamiltonian density associated with the latter space-time. It follows that by construction the corresponding transformed effective kinetic and potential energy densities must take the form [formula] and [formula]

Then, let us introduce explicitly the parametrizations

[formula]

so that respectively

[formula]

Then one can show that the canonical transformations ([\ref=CAN-TRANSF]) are realized by means of the 4 - tensor NLPT-transformation laws

[formula]

The last equation delivers in particular [formula] which implies

[formula]

too.

Finally, invoking the parametrizations ([\ref=V_R-param]) and ([\ref=V_R-P-param]) one can show that the 4 - scalar G(s) can always be prescribed so that identically [formula] implying in turn

[formula]

As a consequence of Eqs.([\ref=ALFA-n]) and ([\ref=ALFA-n2]) one therefore finds that

[formula]

so that as anticipated the GR-Hamilton equations ([\ref=CAN-R1]) and ([\ref=CAN-R2]) do actually hold simultaneously.

The conclusion is therefore that the extended covariance principle indeed holds in the case of the NLPT associated with the Einstein's TT-problem.
