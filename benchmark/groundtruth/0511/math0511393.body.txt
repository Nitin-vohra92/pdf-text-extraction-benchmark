We use symbols [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] to represent the sets of integers, nonnegative integers, positive integers, real numbers and positive real numbers, respectively . In addition, we also adopt the convention that 00 = 1.

Finite disjoint subsets U and V of [formula] will be called a Prouhet-Tarry-Escott pair for the given integer n > 1 if they have the same cardinality and

[formula]

The notion of a P-sequence is recursively defined as follows:

〈1, - 1〉 is a P-sequence;

If [formula] is a P-sequence and a0 =  - ak, then

[formula]

is also a P-sequence;

If [formula] is a P-sequence and a0 = ak, then

[formula]

is also a P-sequence;

Each P-sequence can be obtained only by finite use of the above clauses.

We denote the n-th P-sequence by Pn (assuming that they are ordered by their increasing lengths). For instance,

[formula]

For an arbitrary positive integer n, n-th P-sequence [formula] and any integer [formula] let us define a polynomial function Fn,s(x) by

[formula]

[formula] for [formula].

Proof. Since

[formula]

(here F(n - 1 - s)n,n - 1 is the (n - 1 - s)-th derivative of Fn,n - 1), it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

We use induction on n. Trivially (1) is true for n = 1, so let us assume that for some [formula] equality (1) holds . We have the following two cases:

n = 2m. Assuming that [formula], we have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

so F2m + 1,2m is a constant function. Since F2m + 1,2m( - k) = 0, we conclude that [formula].

n = 2m + 1. Similarly to the previous case one can easily check that F2m + 2,2m + 1 is a constant function. Since [formula], we conclude that [formula] as well. [formula]

For [formula] the degree of Fn,s is equal to s - n.

Proof. Clearly, it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

Observe that an immediate consequence of Lemma 1 is the fact that each Fn,n is a constant function.

We use by induction on n. [formula], so let us assume that for some [formula] relation (2) holds.

n = 2m. Assuming that [formula], we have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

F2m + 1,2m + 1 is a constant function, so

[formula]

Since ai = ak - i, we have that

[formula]

By induction hypothesis F2m,2m + 1 is a linear function (thus 1-1), so [formula].

n = 2m + 1. Similarly to the previous case one can easily deduce that

[formula]

and

[formula]

which combined with the induction hypothesis implies that

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] be a P-sequence. Then:

[formula];

[formula].

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1 and the fact that

[formula]

[formula]

Now let us describe how can one use the P-sequences in order to generate the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott pairs:

Let [formula] be an arbitrary integer and let [formula] be the n-th P-sequence. By Lemma 1 we have that

[formula]

(observe that [formula]). Since each P-sequence has the same number of 1s and - 1s, we have that sets Xp,l and Yp,l defined by

[formula]

have the same (finite) cardinality and

[formula]

which at once yields a solution of the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem.

For the n-th P-sequence [formula] let

[formula]

Clearly, Xn and Yn are disjoint and |Xn| = |Yn| + 1. Furthermore, using the definition of the notion of a P-sequence one can easily check that

[formula]

and the sets [formula] and [formula] are disjoint and have the same cardinality. Bearing in mind the Corollary 1, we see that for each [formula]

[formula]

For instance, if n = 4, then X4  =  {1,2,6,7,11,12}, Y4  =  {4,5,8,9,13}, U = {7,11,12}, V = {8,9,13} and

[formula]

Observe that (A) and (B) are not equivalent (i.e. they produce different sets of Prouhet-Tarry-Escott pairs).
