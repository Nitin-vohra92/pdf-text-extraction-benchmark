On the use of the Kodama vector field in spherically symmetric dynamical problems

Introduction

Let us start with a four dimensional spherically symmetric dynamical spacetime. The metric of such a spacetime can be given as

[formula]

where gAB is a non-singular Lorentzian two-metric, moreover, gAB and R are smooth functions of the coordinates xA (the capital Latin indices take the values 1 and 2) exclusively. The Kodama vector field [\cite=ko] (see also [\cite=hay], and also [\cite=misao] for a generalisation to higher dimensional spacetimes) is defined as

[formula]

where εab denotes the volume form associated with the two-metric gAB. It can be checked by a straightforward calculation that

[formula]

moreover, by making use of the Einstein's equations it can also be shown (see for details [\cite=ko]) that

[formula]

does vanish, where Gab denotes the Einstein tensor. This later relation implies that the vector field

[formula]

is also divergence free. This means that even though the spacetime might be completely dynamical, i.e. there might be no timelike Killing vector field in the underlying setting, Ja is a locally conserved energy flux vector field.

Dynamical spacetimes with a massless scalar field

Let us consider now the particular case of a massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The Einstein equations are given as

[formula]

with energy-momentum tensor

[formula]

The field equation relevant for the scalar field reads as

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=Ein]) and ([\ref=Tab]) that

[formula]

as it should be in consequence of the diffeomorphism invariance of the underlying theory.

Hereafter, we shall use a regular spherical coordinate system (t,r,θ,φ) so that r is chosen to be the area radial coordinate, i.e. a two-sphere of radius r has proper area

[formula]

Then the canonical form of the line element can be given as

[formula]

where the metric functions A and B are assumed to be smooth functions of the coordinates t and r. Notice that in these coordinates the Kodama vector field takes the form

[formula]

To recognise the intimate relation between the Einstein equations, in particular which of them can be derived from the others it is informative to consider the divergence

[formula]

of the tensorial expression Eab = Gab - 8πTab vanishing of which implies that the Einstein equations are satisfied. Using now the fact that Eab has only four non-zero (algebraically independent) components one gets that the only two non identically vanishing components - the t and r components - of [formula] can be given as

[formula]

[formula]

respectively.

The standard way of interpretation goes as follows. If one assumes that the field equations Err = 0 and Eθθ = 0 are satisfied one can get by the substitution of these relations to ([\ref=Et]) and ([\ref=Er]) a first order linear homogeneous system of PDEs relevant for Ett and Etr. This system possesses the trivial solution for trivial data which implies that the "constraints propagate", i.e. Ett = 0 and Etr = 0 are satisfied everywhere if they hold on the initial data surface.

In the present case there is an other possible way of interpretation of the above relations, as well. Assume now that the field equations Ett = 0, Etr = 0 and Err = 0 are satisfied. The substitution of these relations to ([\ref=Er]) implies that the fourth Einstein equation follows from the others, i.e. Eθθ = 0 is automatically satisfied.

Since the other relation ([\ref=Et]) has not been used here there has remained a further possible simplification between the Einstein equations Ett = 0, Etr = 0 and Err = 0. To determine it assume now that only the field equations Ett = 0 and Err = 0 are satisfied everywhere. The substitution of these relations into ([\ref=Et]) yields then

[formula]

which is a linear PDE for Etr and can be considered as ODEs for Etr on each of the time level surfaces. These equations possesses the trivial solution, i.e. Etr = 0 is also satisfied everywhere, whenever Etr = 0 is satisfied at the centre.

By combining the above two statements one can conclude, as it was done by Choptuik [\cite=cho] (see also [\cite=gu]), that all of the algebraically independent Einstein equations are satisfied whenever Ett = 0 and Err = 0 hold everywhere and, in addition, Etr = 0 is guaranteed to be satisfied at the centre.

The basic structure of the field equations

By making use of the auxiliary variables

[formula]

([\ref=we]) can be given in the form of the following first-order system

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, the Einstein equations Ett = 0, Etr = 0 and Err = 0 can be shown to take the form

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Because all the variables A,B,Φ and Π appears in the above equations by adapting Choptuik's approach one could simply evolve the scalar field according to the hyperbolic equations ([\ref=1st]) and ([\ref=2nd]) and solve the elliptic equations ([\ref=Ett]) and ([\ref=Err]) on each time level surface. According to the argument concerning the dependence of the Einstein equations on each other this method provides a completely satisfactory solution for the full elliptic-hyperbolic system of equations provided that ([\ref=Etr]) is also ensured to be satisfied at the origin. This later property can easily be guaranteed by the obvious choice B = 1 at the centre which also necessary to avoid the presence of a conical singularity there. It is a remarkable property of the gauge choice applied by Choptuik that all the equations ([\ref=Ett]) - ([\ref=Err]) concerning the gravitational degrees of freedom are of first order ones, moreover, two of these equations, along with the assumption that B = 1 at the centre, determine the functions A and B completely.

The Kodama vector field as a time evolution vector field

The significance of the use of the Kodama vector field in relation with the above discussed dynamical problem gets to be transparent upon applying the Kodama vector field, as the time evolution vector field, instead of (∂  /  ∂t)a which was used, e.g., in the above described approach of Choptuik. To see this replace all the time derivatives with respect to the coordinate t by derivatives with respect to a variable τ in the above given field equations according to the rule

[formula]

We can also think of the variable τ as a natural parametrisation of the Kodama vector field with respect to which it can be given as Ka = (∂  /  ∂τ)a.

We also need to replace the r-derivatives in the above field equations because of the simultaneous change of the coordinates (t,r) into (τ,ρ) given by the implicit relation

[formula]

Then for an arbitrary function F given originally as a C1 function of (t,r) we have the relations

[formula]

[formula]

where by ([\ref=r1]) for the coefficient ∂t  /  ∂τ we have

[formula]

but we do not know the other coefficient ∂t  /  ∂ρ. In fact, it is not this factor what we really need. Instead, as it is implied by ([\ref=s1]) and ([\ref=s2])

[formula]

whence only the knowledge of the combined factor [formula] is needed to get the field equations relevant for the the introduced new variables. This, however, also means that the function C will explicitly be present in the evolution equations for B,Φ and Π, therefore, we shall need an evolution equation for C, as well. Such an equation can be derived as follows. In virtue of ([\ref=s3]) we have that [formula] holds. By deriving this relation with respect to ρ we get then that

[formula]

which in virtue of ([\ref=s3]), ([\ref=r2]), ([\ref=Ett]) and ([\ref=Err]) yields the desired evolution equation for C as

[formula]

It can also be seen that the replacements ([\ref=r1]) and ([\ref=r2]) yields from equations ([\ref=1st]), ([\ref=2nd]) and ([\ref=Etr]) the relations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Notice that the metric variable A does not appear in either of the equations ([\ref=c]), ([\ref=11st]), ([\ref=22nd]) and ([\ref=eEtr]). Moreover, they consist of a first order symmetric hyperbolic system for which the initial value problem is known to be well-posed [\cite=ch]. What is even more important is that this system of evolution equations, along with

[formula]

derived from ([\ref=Err]), consist of a complete system, i.e.

[formula]

derived from ([\ref=Ett]) and Eθθ = 0 are automatically satisfied whenever ([\ref=c]), ([\ref=11st]), ([\ref=22nd]), ([\ref=eEtr]) and ([\ref=A]) hold everywhere, moreover, ([\ref=const]) is satisfied on the initial data surface. Notice also that since the equations ([\ref=c]) - ([\ref=eEtr]) separates from ([\ref=A]) the later one can be solved independently upon the functions B,C,Φ and Π are determined.

Thus we solve the Cauchy problem relevant for the chosen dynamical system by specifying first initial data for the variables B,C,Φ and Π so that they satisfy the constraint ([\ref=const]). We let then the system to evolve under the control of the hyperbolic equations ([\ref=c]), ([\ref=11st]), ([\ref=22nd]) and ([\ref=eEtr]). Finally, the metric variable A has to be determined by solving the linear PDE ([\ref=A]) in terms of the already known functions B,C,Φ and Π.

We would like to emphasise that the apparently singular behaviour of equations ([\ref=11st]), ([\ref=22nd]), ([\ref=A]) and ([\ref=const]) at the centre, ρ = 0, is compensated by the fact that whenever the functions B and Φ are smooth they can be given in a neighbourhood of the centre as

[formula]

with β and φ being smooth functions of τ and ρ.

It is also important to know whether the expression B2 - C2 appearing in the denominators of ([\ref=11st]) and ([\ref=22nd]) may vanish anywhere. In this respect we have only the following simple observations. It seems to be reasonable to have initial data [formula] on the initial data surface which choice corresponds to the case where the t = const and τ = const surfaces coincide at our initial data surface. Notice, moreover, that by ([\ref=c]) the value of C cannot increase during the evolution so it will be always non-positive. In addition, we also have by ([\ref=c]) and ([\ref=eEtr]) that

[formula]

[formula]

The second of these equations implies that B - C will never vanish since B - C = 1 on the initial data surface. However, the first of these equation does not exclude the vanishing of B + C. It may happen that B + C vanishes somewhere in the computation domain. Note, however, that the vanishing of B + C would correspond to a coordinate singularity of the metric given in the new coordinates as

[formula]

Such a break down of the new coordinate system cannot, however, occur in a neighbourhood of the centre where, in virtue of ([\ref=c]) and ([\ref=eEtr]), B + C = 1 holds there identically.

Finally, we would like to emphasise that to get the simple form of the evolution equation ([\ref=c]) - ([\ref=eEtr]) for our basic variables B,C,Φ and Π we could also start with the metric ([\ref=le2]) and apply the substitutions

[formula]

These later relations can be derived by making use of ([\ref=sub1]) and ([\ref=s2]) - ([\ref=r2]). Notice also that in this setup there is no need to solve any equation for A since the time evolution of all the basic variables is governed by ([\ref=c]) - ([\ref=eEtr]).

Final remarks

The favourable aspects of the use of the Kodama vector field in the investigated evolutionary problem gets apparent if one thinks of the straightforward process yielded the above simple setup. In fact, it is very unlikely that whenever one is given the investigated gravity scalar field system, without making use of the Kodama vector field, one would ever chose the gauge in which the metric possesses the form ([\ref=le2]), moreover, one would also apply the substitution ([\ref=sub2]).

It is also important to emphasise that the above described process had immediately provided a system of first order symmetric hyperbolic evolution equations for the smallest possible number of variables. The significance of this point gets to be transparent whenever, in case of other gauge choices, one tries to use the standard techniques of reduction to get a system of first order PDEs from second order ones. It might be surprising but, in general, such a simple minded process does not automatically yield a system of strongly hyperbolic evolution equations. Recall that without possessing this property even the well-posedness of the associated evolutionary problem is not guaranteed.

It is also worth mentioning that the main conclusions of the present paper generalise straightforwardly to the case of self-interacting matter fields. In the appendix the evolution equations relevant for case of a generic self-interacting scalar field, along with the related modifications of the argument applied above for the massless scalar field can be find. The time evolution of more complicated coupled gravity-matter systems, including various non-linearly coupled gauge fields like Yang-Mills and Higgs fields, will be studied elsewhere.

There is a definite disadvantage of the applied canonical gauge representation, which is, in fact, shared by any of the gauge representations using the area radial coordinate. The disadvantage is that the trapped region cannot be represented in an associated coordinate domain since it necessarily breaks down at the marginally trapped surfaces. In particular, in case of the applied gauge choice the marginally trapped surfaces can only appear in the limit B = (1 - 2m / r)- 1  →    ∞  .

Appendix

Consider now the particular case of a self-interacting scalar field Ψ, i.e. we shall assume that the dynamics of Ψ can be derived from a Lagrangian of the form [formula], where the potential V is an arbitrary but sufficiently regular expression depending only on the field variable Ψ. For instance, V(Ψ) could be chosen to be the widely used quadratic potential, [formula], with λ,Ψ0  ≥  0, although as it will be seen below the following argument does not require such a limitation in the functional form of V(Ψ).

The field equation and the energy-momentum tensor relevant for the above specified generic system read as

[formula]

and

[formula]

A direct calculation also justifies that the associated changes in equations ([\ref=11st]), ([\ref=22nd]), ([\ref=A]) and ([\ref=const]) can be given as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Notice first that the metric variable A does not entered to either of the formerly A-independent equations. In fact, the most important change is that not only the derivatives [formula] and [formula], given in terms of Π and Φ, enter to the above field equations but also the field Ψ itself via the self-interaction potential V(Ψ). This necessitates, in addition to ([\ref=c]), ([\ref=111st]), ([\ref=222nd]) and ([\ref=eEtr]), the use of the evolution equation

[formula]

for Ψ. This equation can be derived from the relations defining Π and that of ([\ref=r1]), moreover, ([\ref=Phitau]) is also independent of the metric variable A. More importantly, ([\ref=Phitau]), ([\ref=111st]), ([\ref=222nd]), ([\ref=eEtr]) and ([\ref=c]) can be seen to possess the form of a first order symmetric hyperbolic system

[formula]

where the vector variable u and the symmetric coefficient matrix Aρ are given as

[formula]

moreover, the vector expression S(u) stores all the suitably arranged source terms of equations ([\ref=Phitau]), ([\ref=111st]), ([\ref=222nd]), ([\ref=eEtr]) and ([\ref=c]). For such a system the initial value problem is known to be well-posed. Moreover, again we have that this system - consisting of ([\ref=Phitau]), ([\ref=111st]), ([\ref=222nd]), ([\ref=eEtr]) and ([\ref=c]) -, along with ([\ref=AA]), comprises a complete system, i.e. ([\ref=cconst]) and Eθθ = 0 can be derived from them, whenever ([\ref=Phitau]), ([\ref=111st]), ([\ref=222nd]), ([\ref=eEtr]), ([\ref=c]) and ([\ref=AA]) hold everywhere, moreover, ([\ref=cconst]) is satisfied on the initial data surface. Since, as it was before, ([\ref=Phitau]), ([\ref=111st]), ([\ref=222nd]), ([\ref=eEtr]) and ([\ref=c]) separate from ([\ref=AA]) the later can be solved for the metric variable A independently upon the functions Ψ,Π,Φ,B and C have been determined.
