Introduction

The general theory of superselection sectors in low dimensional Quantum Field Theory is still lacking so the study of special models is of great interest. Relevant progress has been achieved in the past years using Algebraic Quantum Field Theory for various classes of models such as loop groups, orbifold models and coset models, see [\cite=EK] and [\cite=sch06] also for a historical review.

In this approach a complete classification of rational models (i.e. with a finite number of sectors) with Virasoro central charge c < 1, see [\cite=klm01] [\cite=kl04], and for the local extensions of compact type of the Virasoro net on the circle at c = 1 has been attained, see [\cite=car04] for details. In purely massive theories the triviality of sectors has been proved in [\cite=mug98]. Two notable features of the theory are the presence of topological sectors of solitonic origin, see [\cite=klx04] [\cite=mug04], and the following dichotomy between the rational and non rational case established in [\cite=lx04]: if in a model all irreducible sectors have conjugates then, it is either rational or has uncountably many different irreducible sectors.

In this paper we deal with a non rational c = 1 model, the massless scalar free field, also called the Streater and Wilde model after its first formulation using the ideas of local nets in [\cite=sw70]. Our main goal is to understand better the interplay between chiral and time zero formulation of the superselection structure in 1+1-dimensional theories, the nature of solitonic and non solitonic sectors, the relation between DHR sectors and the presence of a quantum global internal symmetry, usually reducing to a global compact gauge group.

The results obtained in this paper, and in its sequel [\cite=fabio4], are largely adaptable to other theories based on Weyl algebras and give a strong further application of Roberts' net cohomology for discussing superselection sectors in general spacetime context, see [\cite=rob00] for reference.

The observables of the Streater and Wilde model are obtained from the quantized derivatives of the classical fields by imposing a constraint condition on the solutions of the two dimensional wave equation. This choice avoids infrared divergences, see [\cite=sw70] and references therein, and for this reason the model is also called the theory of the potential of the field.

The existence of a (physical, separable) Hilbert space representation for the observable net is obtained in the usual way by the Fock space second quantization procedure for Weyl algebras. For the same net, the existence of a continuous, i.e. uncountable, family of DHR superselection sectors is known from the original description in [\cite=sw70] (see [\cite=H] [\cite=rob00] for general references on the Doplicher, Haag, Roberts theory of superselection sectors). They are labeled by pairs of real numbers, i.e. by the elements of [formula] (here the subscript d means discrete topology) and realized as inner automorphisms by some left/right movers (solitons) of a field net extension. Other relevant features of the model were discussed in [\cite=hl82], namely the Tomita Takesaki modular structure, spacelike and timelike duality.

The usual chiral net formulation of the Streater and Wilde model is treated in [\cite=bmt88] and the above cited extension may be classified according to [\cite=car04] as being of compact type.

A relevant step in the description of Weyl algebras models was the introduction of non-regular representations, see [\cite=tn92] and [\cite=ams93] [\cite=ams93a]: for such a representation π of W(V,σV), the Weyl algebra on the symplectic space (V,σV), there is a subspace of elements v∈V such that, for [formula], the map [formula] is not weakly continuous.

The papers just cited pointed out the utility of such Hilbert space representations in the presence of a theory with uncountable many sectors. This avoids the use of inner product spaces with indefinite metrics, for the (unphysical) representation of charged fields. However, the same papers do not attack the problem of a local net theory in a non-regular representation, nor the full description of its DHR sectors and associated gauge group.

The task of this first paper is to collect the known results on the Streater and Wilde model and reconstruct the DHR sectors theory using a putative field net [formula] (that do not satisfies the locality condition) and a compact group G of gauge symmetries, such that the observable net [formula] is the fixed-point net under the action of G, restricted to the representation Hilbert space Ha of the observables, i.e. [formula]. In the second paper we legitimate the net [formula] as the complete field net of [formula], and the description of the superselection structure is hence similar to the higher dimensional one of a field system with gauge symmetry, see the celebrated [\cite=dr90] for definitions and results, apart from the presence of braid symmetry instead of permutation symmetry.

To construct such a field net, together with the gauge group structure, we use the abstract tool of 2-cocycle twisted crossed product of Weyl algebras, i.e. the reinterpretation of the Weyl algebras of fields as an extension of that of the observables by the cocycle twisted action of the charge group. This simple current extension is defined by a (generalized) 2-cocycle derived from the symplectic form of the Weyl algebras, in its observable and charge-gauge group components, already partially studied in the physical literature, see for example [\cite=her98].

The extension of the symplectic spaces in the model has the structure [formula] where the symplectic form splits as [formula]. Here, the space C is the discrete Abelian charge group. The structure of the corresponding Weyl algebras is then

[formula]

Here U(C) denotes the Abelian group C written multiplicatively. Note that the factor W(N,σN) commutes with W(Va,σa), but is acted upon by the charge group through the 2-cocycle z, reflecting the symplectic interaction between N and C.

Such a construction, in a time zero formulation, allows one to classify the sectors labeled by [formula] as restrictions of solitonic (twisted) and non solitonic (untwisted) sector automorphisms of two different simple current extensions of the net of the observables. Hence these sectors accord to the definitions in [\cite=mug04] and [\cite=klx04], but this classification reflects a different perspective respect to the equivalent nature of the left/right solitons of the chiral formulation. Moreover, the time zero approach makes evident the presence of a non trivial center [formula] of the fixed-point net under the action of the global compact gauge group G, weakly continuously represented on the unphysical Hilbert space.

Namely, the construction by a simple current extension, gives a six-term diagram of inclusions of (localized nets of) symplectic spaces, Weyl algebras and von Neumann algebras with the action of the charge and gauge groups. To introduce the test function spaces used to define the time zero symplectic spaces of the model, we denote by S the Schwartz space of real valued rapidly decreasing functions on the real line, ∂S the space of functions that are derivative of functions in S and by ∂ -  1S the C∞-functions whose derivative is in S.

Referring to the classical theory of the quantum massless field in 1+1 dimensions, if φ denotes the field and [formula] its conjugate momentum field, the currents extension corresponds to two different test function space extensions: the codimension 1 extension from ∂S to S, which corresponds to lifting the condition that test functions for the massless time-zero field φ should vanish at zero wave number in Fourier space, and the codimension 2 extension from S to ∂ -  1S which corresponds to admitting as test functions for the time-zero conjugate momentum field π both constant functions and odd functions tending to constants at infinity. These extensions of test function spaces, together with the extension of the corresponding symplectic form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are two different couples of test functions for field and momentum respectively, give the extension from the algebra of observables to the algebra of fields. We hence denote by C the space of quotient classes (0) for φ and by Q the space of quotient classes f1( +   ∞  ) - f1( -   ∞  ) for π. Together, they form a two-dimensional real space of charges [formula], furnished with the discrete topology, i.e. [formula], and playing the role of the charge group of the model, denoted only by C in the more generic formula ([\ref=e:prima]).

Omitting some intermediate terms, a reduced version of the cited diagram of inclusions for the (nets of) symplectic spaces and the von Neumann algebras of the observables and putative fields, is

[formula]

In these diagrams, [formula] denotes the space of constant test functions for π, that plays the same role of N in ([\ref=e:prima]). The charge group acts non trivially only on the non trivial central tensor factor Zb, the Abelian von Neumann algebra generated by the representation of N.

A major task, that we postpone to the second paper [\cite=fabio4], is the question of the completeness of the [formula]-labeled superselection theory. A positive answer is given by a careful choice of the index sets defining the nets and by the very effective theory of net cohomology of Roberts. Actually, we determine the sectors for a large class of models given by an extension of Weyl algebras.

In the second paper the non trivial center, or relative commutant [formula], is discussed more deeply. This feature is considered for example in [\cite=bl03]. It will also be pointed out that it is related to the [formula]-graded commutation rules of the non local field net [formula]. Moreover, the relation with the superselection theory in presence of constraints, see [\cite=bg04], and further structural properties of the nets of the Streater and Wilde model, such as duality properties with respect to different index sets and split properties, will also be considered.

The structure of this paper is as follows.

In Section [\ref=s:Weyl] we recall known and add new material on Weyl algebras, at the abstract algebraic, C* and von Neumann algebraic level. Particularly, in Subsection [\ref=ss:_isom_twist] a definition of the twisted cross product of Weyl algebras is given, and used to describe the observable-charge coupling in a physical model. In Subsection [\ref=ss:reps] we present some useful requirements of independence of the states on the Weyl algebras of a twisted cross product, necessary for physically interesting representations, on a non separable Hilbert space.

A detailed account of non-regular representations of Weyl algebras is presented in Subsections [\ref=ss:Elementary_Weyl_algebras]. The attention is focused on the non-regular representation of the elementary Weyl algebras on the symplectic space [formula], presented for example in [\cite=tn92], to be used as a building block for the general twisted product case.

Section [\ref=s:SW_model] is devoted to the twisted cross product formulation of the Streater and Wilde model with initial data on the time zero line. Fixing any charged element in the symplectic space, gives a symplectic isomorphism that exponentiates to an isomorphism of Weyl algebras. The defining representations for some intermediate and the larger putative field algebra are also introduced through this isomorphism, in an essentially unique way.

The local net theory of the model is presented in Section [\ref=s:_Local_theory_SW_model_rep], in the usual approach: the time zero observable net A on the index set of the open bounded intervals of the time zero line is defined, so that, if I is such an interval and the base of the double cone O, i.e. I'' = O, then [formula]. Similarly four more intermediate nets and the putative field net F are defined. The net F realizes the cited simple current extensions. In Subsection [\ref=ss:Chiral_versus_time_zero] the relation between the chiral and the time zero formulation is discussed. The usual d'Alambert formula gives an isomorphic correspondence between the symplectic spaces and the charges in the two cases. In Subsection [\ref=ss:dhr_gauge_group] we present a detailed description of the twisted and untwisted automorphisms describing the sectors. Finally, in Subsection [\ref=ss:gaugess] the global compact Abelian gauge group G is derived as the Bohr compactification of a subspace, isomorphic to [formula], of the symplectic space of the fields. Further details on the braided tensor category of the DHR sectors of [formula] will be presented in [\cite=fabio4].

Weyl Algebras

We recall in this section some essential results of the theory of Weyl algebras and fix the general notation, referring mainly to [\cite=BRII] and [\cite=mstv] [\cite=sla72].

For V a separable real (topological) vector space, we denote by σV a (continuous) symplectic form on it, i.e. a [formula]bilinear, antisymmetric, real valued, (continuous) form on V  ×  V and by (V,σV) the associated real symplectic space. The abstract *-algebra on [formula] generated by the elements W(v),  v∈V, with product and involution defined respectively by

[formula]

for v,v'∈V is called the Weyl algebra of (V,σV) and indicated by W(V,σV), or with WV if no confusion arises.

We have to note that, as far as we consider abstract non represented Weyl algebras, it turns out to be needless to specify the topology on V, i.e. we can use the discrete one. Passing to the representations on a Hilbert space, the topology on the (support of the) symplectic space will play its role: Fock representations and, more generally, regular representations are typical examples, as we shell better see in the sequel.

The relations ([\ref=e:def_Weyl_algebra]) imply that W(0) = I, W(v)- 1  =  W( - v) = W(v)*, i.e. the generators of the Weyl algebra are formal unitaries and

[formula]

The algebra W(V,σV) is a unital, generally non commutative *-algebra, that is simple iff the symplectic form σV is non degenerate, i.e. if σV(v,v')  =  0 for all v∈V implies v' = 0.

In [\cite=mstv] [\cite=sla72] a well established standard theory associates a unique C*-norm to any Weyl algebra, called the minimal regular norm. The symplectic form σV is non degenerate on V iff a unique C*-norm on W(V,σV) exists, hence coinciding with the minimal regular one. We denote by C * (V,σV) the C*-algebra generated by the Weyl algebra W(V,σV) in the minimal regular norm, and call it the (unique) C*-algebra associated with W(V,σV). We term

[formula]

the degeneracy subspace of V, so that [formula] is the Abelian *-subalgebra generated by NV. Its completion in the minimal regular norm on W(V,σV), denoted by C*(NV), constitutes the center of C * (V,σV), i.e.

[formula]

C * (V,σV) is simple iff NV  =  {0} and in the degenerate case, i.e. NV  ≠  {0}, the minimal regular norm on WV is not the only C*-norm on WV.

Clearly, if V0: = V / NV and [formula] (we use the notation [formula] for the restriction of the symplectic form to a subspace H  ⊂  V), the pair (V0,σV0) is a non degenerate symplectic space and the C*-algebra C * (V0,σV0) it generates is simple. The degenerate case is treated in [\cite=mstv], also when V is replaced by an Abelian topological group.

If σV is non degenerate and V has a complexification, i.e. an operator J such that σV(  ·  ,J  ·  ) is a positive definite form and

[formula]

we immediately get a pre-Hilbert space structure for V, whose inner product is defined from the symplectic form by

[formula]

Actually such a correspondence between the pair σV,J and (  ·  ,  ·  )V is bijective, up to isomorphism, and the complexification is necessary to obtain a pure quasi-free state and a Fock representation for WV (see e.g. [\cite=BRII]). This is the usual method, necessary in some sense, to obtain a definite metric Hilbert space representation, for the (observable) algebra of a physical model.

Isomorphisms and twisted crossed products of Weyl algebras

We focus in the sequel on two relevant symplectic structures: isomorphisms and twisted compositions of symplectic spaces; these respectively give rise functorially to isomorphic and twisted crossed products of Weyl and C*-algebras.

A symplectic morphism between symplectic spaces is given as a (continuous) map on the spaces, preserving the symplectic forms. An invertible morphism, i.e. an isomorphism, may be defined also in the case of degeneracy as follows

Given two symplectic spaces (V1,σ1) and (V2,σ2), a symplectic space isomorphism ψ:(V1,σ1)  →  (V2,σ2) is a continuous isomorphism between V1 and V2 as real topological vector spaces, that preserves the symplectic form, i.e

[formula]

A symplectic isomorphism exponentiates functorially to a Weyl algebras isomorphism between W(V1,σV1) and W(V2,σV2) and to a center-preserving C*-algebras isomorphism denoted by

[formula]

Consider now

[formula], the category of all the Weyl algebras as objects and all the (purely algebraic) isomorphisms between them as morphisms.

The above discussion may be formalized saying that there exists a Weyl exponentiation functor [formula] that realizes an isomorphism of categories between

[formula], the category of symplectic spaces as objects and symplectic isomorphisms as morphisms;

[formula], the subcategory of [formula], where the morphisms are only [formula] for ψ a symplectic isomorphism as in Definition [\ref=d:_isomorphism].

Using the C*-closure of Weyl algebras in the uniquely defined minimal regular norm, both of these categories are isomorph to the following one in C*-context, from which [formula] is obtained by a forgetful topology functor:

[formula], the subcategory of Weyl C*-algebras as objects and the unit preserving isomorphisms [formula] of [formula] as morphisms, extended to the C*-closure.

Notice that the objects in the previously listed isomorphic categories have different algebraic and topological structures, although defined in a natural way starting from [formula]. A similar natural, physically motivated definition of the representations for the Weyl algebra models is also pursued in the sequel: a typical example is the Fock representation, at least for a Weyl subalgebra and its extension to the whole Weyl algebra.

We may introduce a fourth category, isomorphic to the three above, that is more handy from the point of view of the crossed products theory. The objects of this category are called Weyl algebra groups and defined as in the sequel: to any (also degenerate) symplectic space furnished with the discrete topology, a Weyl group U(V,σV) is associated such that

[formula]

is a short exact sequence. This means that the discrete twisted crossed product [formula] is an extension of the Abelian formal symbols group U(V) on the symplectic space V, by the torus group [formula] and the 2-cocycle (see [\cite=rob98])

[formula]

where the action is trivial, [formula], and the function [formula] is defined by the symplectic form. Hence, the above announced fourth category is defined by

[formula], the category of the Weyl algebra groups as objects and the symplectic derived group isomorphisms as morphisms, i.e. [formula] for ψ as in Definition [\ref=d:_isomorphism].

A Weyl algebra is hence simply recovered as a discrete crossed product [formula]. Observe that this is not a semidirect product, eventually defined by a non trivial action β, but a crossed product twisted by the non trivial function y.

A useful decomposition in the case of degeneracy is also possible, where the equation ([\ref=e:exact_seq_U(L)]) is better replaced by an extension making the degeneracy explicit:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the center of the group U(V,σV), and we have [formula]. This extension may be read as the discrete twisted crossed product

[formula]

where y take value on the [formula]-part of the normal Abelian subgroup [formula], and the Weyl algebra is also written as [formula].

Another simple example of extension is obtained from a direct sum of symplectic spaces (H,σH) and (L,σL) defined by:

[formula]

Here we mean that the symplectic form σV decomposes according as [formula], i.e. [formula] and [formula], such that [formula] is an obvious symplectic isomorphism that at Weyl algebras level gives

[formula]

The definition of the C*-maximal tensor product of two C*-algebras gives the C*-algebra isomorphism

[formula]

This is easy to obtain because denoting by [formula], [formula] and [formula] the minimal regular norms on W(H,σH), W(L,σL) and [formula] respectively, for given a∈W(H) and b∈W(L), on a generic elementary tensor [formula] it holds

[formula]

being [formula] and similarly for b∈W(L).

We call such a kind of isomorphism for symplectic spaces, or Weyl and associated C*-algebras, a splitting isomorphism and a direct sum as in equation ([\ref=e:sympl_sum]) may also be called a splitting decomposition of the symplectic space V.

Observe that if both (H,σH) and (L,σL) are non degenerate symplectic spaces, the minimal regular norms [formula] and [formula] are unique and the C*-subcross norms on the algebraic tensor product [formula] all coincide, so that in this case, it holds (see e.g. [\cite=sla72] [\cite=mstv])

[formula]

The splitting isomorphisms are trivial examples of the following general construction: let (H,σH) and (L,σL) be two symplectic spaces, with symbol Abelian groups U(H) and U(L) and let U(H,σH), U(L,σL) be their Weyl algebra groups, defined as in the above equation ([\ref=e:exact_seq_U(L)]). Consider the 2-cocycle [formula], defined for the elements s = W(l),  s'  =  W(l')∈U(L) and t = (ζ,  W(h))∈U(H,  σH) by

[formula]

where the action β is given by a (continuous) real valued, [formula]-bilinear form α, defined on H  ×  L, such that α(h,0)  =  α(0,l) = 0, and the function y defined by

[formula]

To the pair of groups U(H,σH) and U(L) is associated the extension

[formula]

where σV is a symplectic form on [formula], defined by

[formula]

so that

[formula]

represents the interacting content of the non splitting sum.

An extension group is defined from the 2-cocycle z: = (β,  y) as above, i.e. in other notation

[formula]

Explicitly, for generic elements t = (ζ,W(h)),  t' = (ζ',  W(h'))∈U(H,σH) and s = W(l),s' = W(l')∈U(L), the extension group is defined by the product

[formula]

by the identity e = ((1,IH),IL) and the passage to the inverse given by

[formula]

In this generality, we can introduce the following

The algebra on [formula] associated as group algebra to the extension group [formula], where the symplectic form σV and the 2-cocycle (β,y) are defined as above, is called the twisted crossed product algebra of the Weyl algebras W(H,σH) and W(L,σL). This algebra may also be defined as the Weyl algebra on the symplectic space [formula].

In particular cases, such a twisted crossed product of Weyl algebras may be derived from a non splitting decomposition of a symplectic space, as better said in the sequel.

If (V,σV) is a (degenerate) symplectic space and H is a real subspace of it, we denote by

[formula]

the symplectic complement of H in V and by

[formula]

the partially ordered set of the symplectic subspaces of V disjoint to H. The set [formula] has maximal element H' and obviously contains the (eventually non trivial) degeneracy subspace NV. The decomposition seen in equation ([\ref=e:sympl_sum]) holds iff σV(l,h) vanishes for all l∈L and h∈H, i.e. introducing the symbol [formula] called the symplectic disjunction in (V,σV), iff [formula].

To construct examples of Weyl algebras products, suppose given a space decomposition [formula] such that the symplectic form is not splitting, i.e. σV  ≠  σB  +  σC, and there exists a decomposition of one of the addend as [formula], with [formula] and [formula], i.e. [formula]. In such a situation we have for the interacting part of the symplectic form

[formula]

and the non splitting contents of such a decomposition of V is confined in the subspace [formula]. The Weyl algebra associated to (V,σV) is isomorphic to a twisted cross product, in accordance with the following

Given a symplectic space (V,σV) with decomposition

[formula]

there exists a 2-cocycle

[formula]

as in equation ([\ref=e:2_cocycle]), such that for fixed elements s = W(c) and s' = W(c') in U(C) an action [formula], is defined by

[formula]

for the element m = (ζ,  W(n))∈U(N,σN), and where y:U(C)  ×  U(C)  →  U(N,σN) can be written as

[formula]

Such a 2-cocycle gives a twisted crossed product decomposition of the Weyl algebra as

Proof. The subspaces H and L in Definition [\ref=d:semidirect_product] have to be respectively identified with [formula] and C in the case at hand. According to this, in the equation ([\ref=s:forma_simplettica]) we have to read α(h,c) = α(n,c) = σL(n,c) for [formula], and the symplectic form σV decomposes as [formula], where [formula] and [formula].   [formula] Observe that the subspace N may be thought, is some sense, as being in common between the symplectic subspaces B and L, and that the Weyl elements defined from the subspace C have a non trivial action on Weyl elements defined from N  ⊂  B, by the evaluation of σL.

We end this section with some broad ideas about the formalization of physical model by Weyl algebras. In all generality, a simple current extension of Weyl algebras is essentially described by a crossed product of Weyl algebras, along the following scheme. The charge carrying fields are defined starting from a symplectic space

[formula]

Here, we have to read the subspace decomposition [formula] as in Proposition [\ref=p:Weyl_crossed_product] above, with H = Va. The symplectic form σf may not split in the sum [formula], for [formula] and [formula], but if [formula] the field Weyl algebra isomorphically can be written as

[formula]

In these decompositions, Va has the meaning of the symplectic space for the observables algebra, for which a (regular positive metric) Fock space representation πa exists. The representation πf for the field algebra Wf is in general a non-regular extension of πa, as it happens in a non rational model, and U(C) plays the role of the charge group of the theory. Observe that this description is more general that the one treated in Proposition [\ref=p:Weyl_crossed_product], where also [formula] was assumed.

Hence the Weyl algebra models may be classified on the basis of the different specific properties in the above space decomposition ([\ref=e:model_gen]) and the algebraic ones in equation ([\ref=e:ph_crossed]), such as the dimension of C and N as real linear spaces, the evaluation of σV when restricted to C and N, and so on. We will see two different examples below.

As a final remark, observe that the purely algebraic constructions above are shown to entails some general functorial features passing to representations, that are also relevant for the nets of von Neumann algebras, defined from localized symplectic subspaces of a given symplectic space.

Representations

We summarize some general results about the representation theory of a Weyl algebra W(V,σV) and its associated C*-algebra C * (V,σV), see [\cite=sla72] [\cite=mstv] for details:

every positive linear functional on W(V,σV) is continuous with respect to the minimal regular norm and extends to a unique positive, continuous linear functional on C * (V,σV);

every representation π of the Weyl algebra W(V,σV) on a Hilbert space [formula] extends to a representation of C * (V,σV), on the same Hilbert space;

every *-automorphism on W(V,σV) extends uniquely to a *-automorphism of C * (V,σV).

In the sequel we show the relation between the twisted crossed product characterization of Weyl algebras, introduced in the last section, and some factorization properties of their representations. We begin from the simplest situation, the split case of equation ([\ref=e:weyl_cong]) or ([\ref=e:iso_split]), by the following

Let [formula] be a direct sum of symplectic spaces with Weyl algebra [formula] as above. Then

where the latter means the tensor product of the von Neumann algebras πωH(C * (H,σH))'' and πωL(C * (L,σL))''.

Proof. i) πø is obtained as the GNS representation of the product state [formula] on the C*-algebra [formula], i.e. from the state defined by

[formula]

Here [formula] assures for the product state ω a well behaved passage to the representation πø of [formula] on the Hilbert space [formula], obtained as the spatial tensor product of the GNS representations πωH of C * (H,σH) and πωL of C * (L,σL) (see e.g. [\cite=TI] or [\cite=KRII] for details). ii) The results follow directly from [\cite=TI] and the identity

[formula]

This equality, in the case of non degenerate subspaces is given by the equation ([\ref=e:tensors]). In the second case, if C * (L,σL) is Abelian, hence nuclear, it is a well known consequence.   [formula] An elementary example of item ii) in above Lemma [\ref=p:splitting], is given by a splitting isomorphism of symplectic spaces with L = NV, the degenerate subspace of V, and H = V / NV.

Passing to the non splitting situation, the factorization of representations we are interested in, is described by the following general result, also related to one in [\cite=her98]

Let [formula] be a symplectic space decomposition as in Definition [\ref=d:semidirect_product] and equation ([\ref=e:estensione]), such that the Weyl algebra W(V,σv) is not splitting, i.e. the real form α that defines through the equation ([\ref=e:interact]) the interacting part σH,L of the symplectic form σV is non trivial. Then, for given ωH and ωL two states on W(H,σH) and W(L,σL) respectively, the linear functional on W(V,σV) defined for [formula] by

[formula]

is positive, i.e. is a state on W(V,σV), if ωL(W(l)) = 0 for [formula]. In particular, if [formula], i.e. if α is non trivial on any subspace of L, such a condition is also necessary, i.e. if [formula], ω is a state on W(V,σV) iff

[formula]

If [formula] and the condition ([\ref=e:condition_2_weyl]) holds, the state ω is faithful iff so is the state ωH. Respectively changing L with H.

Proof. To verify the hermiticity of ω, we may restrict to an element A = W(l)W(h) for l∈L and h∈H, so that such a property for ω holds iff

[formula]

i.e., by the definition of the action of β in equation ([\ref=e:action_L0]), iff

[formula]

Hence the hermiticity holds if ωL(W(l)) = 0 for [formula]. In particular, if [formula], the hermiticity holds iff the condition ([\ref=e:condition_2_weyl]) is satisfied.

To show the positivity, observe that any element A∈WV is written for li∈L, hi∈H and [formula] with li  ≠  lj for i  ≠  j, as a finite sum

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

where [formula]. Applying the functional ω gives

[formula]

where we used the condition ωL(l) = 0 for [formula], redefined βij from the phases that arise from the evaluation of the states, and the last equality holds because we may call bi = aieiβi for some βi such that βij  =  βi  -  βj. If we suppose that the property ([\ref=e:condition_2_weyl]) holds true for L, we only have [formula], so the faithfulness trivially follows in this case.   [formula] Observe that the above defined state ω is a product state on the tensor product algebras [formula] in the sense of Lemma [\ref=p:splitting], only if the linear form α trivializes, i.e. if [formula].

In particular, the Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case] applies to the symplectic space decomposition as in Proposition [\ref=p:Weyl_crossed_product]. For this case, given the two states ωH on W(H,σH) and ωL on W(L,σL), we define in a canonical way as in Lemma [\ref=p:splitting], the product state

[formula]

on the tensor product Weyl algebra [formula] and denote by [formula] its GNS representation on the Hilbert space [formula].

Now let [formula] be an extension of the state ωH from the Weyl algebra W(H,σH) to the Weyl algebra [formula], for an extension [formula] of the symplectic form σH of H to [formula]. For [formula], let denote by ωC the restriction of a state ωL of W(L,σL) to the subalgebra [formula]. A result relating the states on a twisted crossed product decomposition (Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case]) and a splitting Weyl algebra (Lemma [\ref=p:splitting]), is obtained confining the interacting part σH,L of the symplectic form σV to the subspace N, that is in common between H and L.

Hence we give the following result, where indeed, referring to Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case], H is replaced by [formula] and L by C:

Consider [formula] as in notation above, so that the state ω in equation ([\ref=e:omega_1]) is well defined. Then the following are equivalent:

Proof. i) ⇒   ii) is obtained by a simple calculation from the definitions, for [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

ii) ⇒   i) It suffices to use c = 0 in the preceding calculation to obtain back the first relation in i) and analogously, using h = 0, for the second.   [formula] Notice that for the element h = 0 in H we obtain from the condition i) in the Proposition above that the state [formula] of WN is such that ωN(W(n)) = 1 for every n∈N.

1) Consider a symplectic space decomposition as in Proposition [\ref=p:Weyl_crossed_product] and refer to the physical model discussion about equation ([\ref=e:ph_crossed]). If C represents the charge group for Vf and [formula] is related to the symplectic space of observables, then the triviality of α, i.e. of σN,C, is equivalent to a trivial action of the sector (auto)morphisms on the observables, that means a trivial superselection structure of the model. The condition in equation ([\ref=e:condition_2_weyl]) instead, defines the state ωL in a unique way as a non-regular state (see Definition [\ref=d:non-regular] below). 2) The obtained results actually extend the ones of Herdegen in [\cite=her98], where a crossed product of a Weyl algebra by a CAR algebra is treated: in fact, as observed by Slawny in [\cite=sla72], a CAR algebra may always be written as a Weyl algebra with a non degenerate symplectic form. 3) The Proposition [\ref=P:state_coincidence] suggests that, for twisted crossed products as above, it is the non-regular representations of W(V,σV) that is of interest, with C the non-regular subspace and N the regular subspace of V, see Definition [\ref=d:non-regular] below. This always leads to non rational models, with uncountably many superselection sectors, in the sense of [\cite=lx04].

Further general results for twisted crossed products and non-regular representations of CCR algebras of a generic locally compact group, along the lines of [\cite=gru97] are also possible, see [\cite=fabio03].

Elementary Weyl algebra in non-regular representation

In the above subsection we pointed out the utility of non-regular representations when a field algebra model is written as a cross product of Weyl algebras. A regular (Fock space) representation is used instead on the observable part of the model, also called in literature the physical part, and a non-regular one on the charge part, see e.g. [\cite=ams93]. We recall hence the following basic

A representation π of a Weyl algebra W  =  W(V,σV) is said a regular representation if for all v∈V the one parameter group

[formula]

is weakly (and strongly) continuous. If there exist a non trivial subspace V1  ⊂  V such that the map in equation ([\ref=e:regular_repp]) is not weakly continuous, then the representation π is said to be non-regular. The maximal such subspace is said the non-regular subspace of π. A state ω whose GNS representation πø is regular (non-regular) is also said to be regular (non-regular).

Observe that in general a Weyl algebra is not norm continuous, being [formula] if v1  ≠  v2 for v1,v2∈V. The strong continuity of the regular representations of the Weyl algebras, that is needed for their relevant physical content, is in some sense also necessary to obtain good representation of the associated CCR algebra, see [\cite=rob98] for details.

We now discuss in detail the simplest, but relevant, case of non-regular representation for the symplectic space [formula], in order to use it as a building block for the superselection theory of physical models.

Let [formula] be copies of the additive group of reals, furnished with the discrete topology; consider the symplectic space (L,σL) where [formula] and the symplectic form is the usual non degenerate one on [formula], i.e. for a pair of elements l = (c,n),  l' = (c',n')∈L we have

[formula]

The Weyl algebra WL associated to (L,σL) is hence that of a quantum system with one degree of freedom; its irreducible regular representations, and those of the associated C*-algebra C * (L,σL), are well described by the Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem, see e.g. [\cite=BRII].

To consider a particular non-regular representation of WL, following for example [\cite=tn92], let ωL be the functional on WL defined by

[formula]

This is the unique tracial state on W(L,σL), up to the change of C and N, and it turns out to be not faithful because

[formula]

However, if we denote the GNS triple of ωL by (πL,HL,ΩL), we observe that πL is faithful because WL is simple, as the degeneracy subspace of L is trivial, i.e. NL  =  {0}. The GNS Hilbert space HL is non separable and can be derived from the total set of vectors obtained as

[formula]

The action of a represented Weyl element πL(WL((c,n))) on the generic vector |c',n'〉∈HL, for (c,n),  (c',n')∈L, reads as

[formula]

Moreover, if |c,n〉 and |c',n'〉 are two elements of HL, their scalar product is equal to

[formula]

so that 〈0,n|0,n'〉  =  1. It is hence possible to identify the vectors |c,n〉 for every n∈N with the vector |c,0〉, up to a phase, giving [formula] and [formula]. Because of this identification, we simply write |c〉: = |c,0〉. In particular this is possible for c = 0, so that the following relations hold

[formula]

From the above discussion, the Hilbert space HL may also be written as

[formula]

[formula] being the space of square summable maps from [formula] into [formula], i.e. an element [formula] is a function supported on a countable subset [formula] of [formula] such that [formula]. According to the equation ([\ref=e:inner_prod_weyl]), the inner product on [formula] is equivalently given by

[formula]

Denoting for every [formula] by [formula] the characteristic function of the subset [formula], identifying |c,0〉 with δc gives the isomorphism in above equation ([\ref=e:H_L]).

The representation πL turns out to be irreducible and non-regular, not being strongly continuous in first coordinate c∈C of elements WL(c,r) but only in the second. The von Neumann algebras L: = πL(C * (L,σL))'' is irreducibly represented on HL by πL.

Moreover, we may consider the Weyl elements WL(c,0),  c∈C and WL(0,n),  n∈N, and the Abelian C*-subalgebra of C * (L,σL) they generate, respectively C*(C,0) = :C * (C) and C*(N,0) = :C * (N); finally if C: = πL(C * (C))'' and N: = πL(C * (N))'' are the associated Abelian von Neumann subalgebras of L they define, the properties of these unitaries and algebras are collected in the following

Under the above definitions we have:

Proof. i), ii) and iii) are standard results, see for example [\cite=sla72] and also [\cite=hal04]. For iv) see the above Proposition [\ref=p:Weyl_crossed_product]. v) Considering the total set of vectors |c〉,  c∈C and the action of C on them as read off from equation ([\ref=e:weyl_op_action]), cyclicity for C is trivial, and the maximality is a classical result. For the subalgebra N, consider for every c∈C, the spectral measures μc defined on [formula], the Gelfand spectrum of C * (N), and the Baire set [formula]. These data satisfy the hypothesis of [\cite=cav98] that characterizes πL as a spectrally multiplicity-free representation of C * (L,σL), a stronger condition for N to be maximally Abelian in B(HL). vi) The von Neumann algebras L is equal to the represented discrete crossed product algebra [formula], where Γ: = πL(U(C)) denotes the discrete group U(C) represented on the Hilbert space HL. The automorphic action α defined by [formula] on the maximal Abelian *-algebra N is given by the 2 - cocycle (ι,y), i.e. through the symplectic form σL. It easy to see that α acts ergodically on N, so that L is a factor. Moreover, the state ωL is a tracial state on L so that the algebra is of finite type, and is of type II1 being not finite dimensional.   [formula]

1) The elements π(W((c,0))) for c∈C, may be considered as operators carrying the charge c. The elements π(W((0,n))) for n∈N act as different phases, on the distinct charge subspaces, in the charge decomposition of HL given by equation ([\ref=e:H_L]). 2) The physical idea is to profit of a symplectic space [formula] with [formula] for some natural n, such that C represents the additive group of the charges and its associated dual group [formula] the internal (gauge) symmetry group of the model. The non-regular representation of WL with C the non-regular subspace of L and obtained as the n-th tensor product of the representation πL above, may be used to manage the twisted crossed product of Weyl algebras in a defining state satisfying the requirements of Propositions [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case] and [\ref=P:state_coincidence]. 3) From a mathematical point of view, a similar construction may also be given for the Weyl algebras W(L,σL) where now [formula], for C an Abelian discrete group and N the locally compact group such that its Bohr compactification bN is equal to Ĉ, the dual group of C, i.e. the space of all arbitrary characters of C, see [\cite=mstv] [\cite=sla72] [\cite=gru97] [\cite=fabio03].

The Streater and Wilde model

We begin in this section to analyze the scalar massless free Bosonic quantum field, on the 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, along the lines of the twisted crossed products described in the previous Section [\ref=s:Weyl]. General references are [\cite=sw70] [\cite=hl82] and a recent more physical introduction is [\cite=dm04].

With respect to the original formulation on chiral left/right light lines of the Streater and Wilde paper we prefer a time zero formulation, i.e. giving Cauchy data on the time zero real line, because the classification of the superselection sectors, e.g. their different (solitonic) origin, is more clear in this approach, as it will be shown in Subsection [\ref=ss:dhr_gauge_group].

In contrast to the same model in higher dimension it is well known that in the 1+1-dimensional case infrared infinities occur, so that the observable algebra may be defined in a physical Fock space representation only after furnishing some supplementary constrain conditions reducing the algebra of non observable fields.

If we write [formula] for the Schwartz space of real valued rapidly decreasing functions on the real line, the cited constrains are realized in the Weyl formulation as a restriction of the test function space S to a subspace of functions with vanishing Fourier transform at zero momentum, i.e. [formula], for f∈S. This condition is also written for short as f = ∂g, for some g∈S, and is required for smearing the functions of the observable fields at time zero, not for their Lagrangian associated time zero momentum. For this reason, the observable theory is also called in the literature the theory of the potential of the field.

Weyl algebras for the Streater and Wilde model

The symplectic spaces of the model are introduced by the following restriction and extensions of the function space S:

[formula]

Denoting by [formula] the constant functions on the time zero line, we have the following additive group quotients

[formula]

and the inclusions

[formula]

From the linear spaces in equations ([\ref=e:Schwartz_spaces]) and because of the inclusions in ([\ref=e:inclusions_S]) we define properly included (symplectic) spaces as follows:

[formula]

Moreover, because of the quotient maps in equations ([\ref=e:quotient_S]) we have, for [formula]

[formula]

The symplectic spaces associated to the above support spaces are defined as follows: for [formula] and [formula] elements in Va, a (non degenerate) symplectic form σa is defined by

[formula]

The following standard procedure gives a pre-Hilbert space from the symplectic space Va, defining it on the mass shell (i.e. the positive light cone in momentum space), and leads to a Fock space representation of the associated observable algebras. Let Ta be the map defined by

[formula]

from the real space Va to the real subspace Ta(Va) of [formula], whose closure in [formula] constitutes the real subspace [formula] of [formula], i.e. the one particle Hilbert space of the observables of the model, see [\cite=sw70] [\cite=hl82] for details. The scalar product on Ha is explicitly given, for two elements obtained from F,G∈Va, by

[formula]

For [formula], a quasi-free state on the algebra W(Va,σa) is given by

[formula]

The GNS representation of ωa, whose triple we denote by (πa,Ha,Ωa), is the Fock (vacuum) representation of the algebra W(Va,σa).

This Fock space construction is possible only for the symplectic space (Va,σa), see e.g. [\cite=ams93], but construction with a canonical non-regular representation exists instead for all the Weyl algebras associated to the symplectic spaces in diagram ([\ref=e:def_inclusion_symplectic]) as illustrated below.

Indicated the extension of σa to the space Vk by σk, for Vk each of the real spaces in ([\ref=e:def_inclusion_symplectic]), the pairs (Vk,σk) are real symplectic space, properly included as in the same diagram. Only the symplectic spaces (Vb,σb) and (Ve,σe) are degenerate, with the same degenerate subspace

[formula]

and because of the results on degenerate symplectic forms as in equation ([\ref=e:_Weyl_center]), there exist a common non trivial center of the C*-algebras C * (Vb,σb) and C * (Ve,σe) given by

[formula]

We introduce now some symplectic isomorphisms to discuss the model in terms of twisted crossed products of Weyl algebras as in Subsection [\ref=ss:_isom_twist]. To any function f1∈∂ -  1S, we associate three real values

[formula]

Observe that subtracting the real value F∞ from the second coordinate function f1 of an element [formula] realizes the quotient maps in equations ([\ref=e:quotient_S]). Hence we state the following

For given an element [formula] in Vb (or Ve), we denote by : = f1  -  F ∞  the element in the quotient group [formula] (or [formula]) as in the quotient maps of equations ([\ref=e:quotient_S]). Then

The Weyl functor gives an isomorphism of C*-algebras as

The corresponding isomorphism of C*-algebras given by the Weyl functor is

Proof. ψ ∞  is an isomorphism between the real discrete vector spaces Vb and [formula], so it trivially preserves the symplectic form and the image of the degeneracy subspace N of Vb. The last equality about tensor product holds because C * (N) Abelian. The same for the Ve case.   [formula] A more general symplectic space isomorphism extending ψ ∞  is also possible for the larger symplectic space (Vf,σf) itself, once we have picked an element in it. This isomorphism turns out to be essentially unique. We begin this construction by defining the charges of a generic element [formula]. These are the two real quantities canonically associated to F by

[formula]

A complete useful re-parametrization of the symplectic spaces in diagram ([\ref=e:def_inclusion_symplectic]) is obtained by the choice of a regularizing element T∈Vf with non vanishing charges, i.e. such that Tc  ≠  0  ≠  Tq. A useful choice for such an element of Vf is the following: given a function t∈∂ -  1S such that

[formula]

and denoted by ∂t∈S its derivative, we choice [formula]. For example, we may take [formula], or a half-line or bounded smooth localization obtained from a composition of it with a C∞ function of compact support. Note that [formula] and the charges associated to T both equate 1, in fact

[formula]

Now, because of the fixing of the regularizing element, we may associate to every element F∈Vf two more real numbers

[formula]

and functions

[formula]

In this way, denoting by [formula] and [formula] two copies of the elementary symplectic space as in Subsection [\ref=ss:Elementary_Weyl_algebras], i.e. [formula], and setting

[formula]

it is possible to state the following

For every choice of an element T∈Vf as above, for example as in ([\ref=e:regular_element]):

ψT extends the splitting isomorphisms ψ ∞  of Lemma [\ref=l:psia] for Vb and Ve and reduces to the isomorphisms (Vk,σk)  →  (ψT(Vk),σk) of symplectic spaces when applied to Vk, k = c,q respectively, i.e. such that:

ψT is a [formula]-linear continuous bijection on its image, preserving symplectic forms and degeneracy subspaces;

for elements [formula] and [formula] in Vf we have

[formula]

ψT maps Vc into elements with Fq = 0, Vq into elements with Fc  =  Fn = 0 and Ve into elements with Fc = 0.

Similarly for C * (Ve,σe) instead of C * (Vb,σb);

Proof. The existence of the isomorphisms with the properties described in i) and ii) follows from easy calculations on the above definitions. The essential uniqueness up to the symplectic isomorphism in iii) follows because φTT' is defined from the function T' - T∈Vf, so that the property of invariance of the charges holds iff T' - T has zero charge content.   [formula] We will refer to the additive group [formula] as the charge group of the theory.

1) ψT being non splitting, its exponentiation ΨT gives a Weyl algebra [formula] that is only properly contained in the algebraic tensor product [formula]. The associated C*-algebra is isomorphic to C * (Vf,σf) and only properly contained in the respective (maximal) tensor product as well. Hence, because of the results in Section [\ref=s:Weyl], we have

[formula]

2) Observe that the isomorphism ψ ∞  is introduced to quotient out from an element in Vb or Ve its degenerate part in N. Instead, the isomorphism ψT is tailored to extract from an element in Vf its charge content, i.e. to fix its equivalence class in the additive group [formula] of the charges, dividing out the remaining components in Va, N and R, according to the choice of T∈Vf.

Defining representations for the Streater and Wilde model

We define a reference representation for each Weyl and C*-algebra that functorially derives from the six term diagram ([\ref=e:def_inclusion_symplectic]). These extend the Fock representation of the observable algebra and are non-regular representations that satisfy the properties of factorization indicated in Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case]. The twisted crossed product in ([\ref=e:cross_weyl_prod]), explains the observable and charge content of each of the algebras associated to the symplectic spaces in diagram ([\ref=e:def_inclusion_symplectic]).

We begin by noticing that the equation ([\ref=e:cross_weyl_prod]) gives an interpretation of the non-regular representations introduced for different models of this kind in [\cite=ams93] [\cite=ams93a]. In these papers, the representation of W(Vf,σf) is obtained as the GNS representation associated to the non-regular state

[formula]

where q(F) is a so called generalized quadratic form, defined by

[formula]

If ωa is the Fock state on Wa and for two symplectic spaces with supports [formula] we take two copies ωL and ωM of the non-regular elementary state introduced in Subsection [\ref=ss:Elementary_Weyl_algebras], respectively on the algebras WL and WM, similarly to the equation ([\ref=e:ams_state]) we give the following

For given T∈Vf a charge regularizing element as in Subsection [\ref=ss:WSW_model] and notation as in the previous Proposition [\ref=p:_psif], and for δ being the Kronecker delta, we define a state on the Weyl algebra Wf by

[formula]

Observe that the state in Definition [\ref=d:_state_d_f] differs from the one in equation ([\ref=e:ams_state]) only in restriction to elements Wb(F)∈Wb, with F∈Vb and F∞  ≠  0: the GNS representation of the state ωf, unlike that of ω, maps them in elements different from the identity, as seen in Subsection [\ref=ss:Elementary_Weyl_algebras] for the representation πL. This means that ωf, unlike ω, results to be faithful on the Weyl elements obtained from the subspace N, hence it is preferred in the sequel for obtaining the physical content also for this subspace.

For different regularizing elements, the above definition gives different states, whose GNS representations are actually related by the following

Equivalently, we have [formula], [formula] and [formula], where it is meant [formula] an similar. The representations πa and πb are the only regular ones;

Proof. i) The equivalence for different T is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=p:_psif], because of the isomorphism of the Weyl and C*-algebras and because the states ωf satisfies the factorization condition ([\ref=e:condition_2_weyl]) in Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case]. ii) It suffices to observe that the state ωf reduces to the state ωa on Wa and that if F∈Vf with at least a non vanishing charge, then ωf(W(F)) = 0 because of the Kronecker deltas. iii) is trivial.   [formula]

Local theory, DHR Sectors and Gauge Group

In this section we treat the net approach of AQFT to the Streater and Wilde model. As general reference we use [\cite=H] [\cite=rob00], and for the low dimensional theories also [\cite=klm01].

Let M be the 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and consider [formula] as its time zero axis. We recall some notation and fix new concerning [formula] and [formula], the set of open non void subsets of M and [formula] respectively, partially ordered by inclusion.

A causal disjointness relation [formula] is induced on [formula] from the Minkowski metric. A triple consisting of a subset [formula], the inclusion partial order ⊂   and the disjointness relation [formula] will be called an index set and shortly indicated as [formula]. If P∈P, we denote by [formula] the causally disjoint set of P, i.e. the set of the elements of P disjointed from P.

On the Minkowski spacetime the preferred index set is the set of causally complete bounded connected regions, indicated by K and called the set of open double cones on M and defined as follows: for given x,y∈M with y∈V+x  ⊂  M, the open future cone of x and for V-y  ⊂  M the open past cone of y, a double cone O∈K is defined by the intersection of [formula].

The relation [formula] on M reduces to the set theoretic disjointness relation on the time zero line [formula], i.e. for [formula] [formula]. The index set we work with in this paper, will only be the following:

[formula]

A generic abstract net [formula] on the index set P is defined by an inclusion preserving map

[formula]

A net hence takes its image elements in the objects of a generic category, also furnished with the structures of partial order and disjointness. To distinguish nets defined on different index set and with the same image category, we use the notation [formula] and define a maximal element of the net [formula] by [formula], where the symbol [formula] has to be properly understood relative to the category of the image elements.

A relevant property of a net is locality, i.e. [formula] for P1,  P2∈P and [formula]; it distinguishes Bosonic (i.e. local) from non Bosonic nets.

For given a symplectic space (V,σV) and an appropriate notion of localization of an element of V in an element of an index set P, it remains naturally defined a category of symplectic subspaces with order and disjointness relation [formula]. The partial order is inherited from the one of P, by the defined localization, and the disjointness of two symplectic subspaces V1 and V2 in this category means that [formula], i.e. σ(v1,v2) = 0 for any element v1∈V1 and v2∈V2. Hence [formula] is a first example of the image category of a net that, accordingly to ([\ref=e:gen_net]), we indicate by [formula] and call the net of the symplectic subspaces of the symplectic space (V,σV) on the index set [formula]. Notice that the notion of localization of the elements of V on P, also accounts for the locality of [formula].

The Weyl functor preserves the net structure on P, so that a net of Weyl algebra [formula] and a net of C*-algebra [formula] are also defined, by

[formula]

Here the completion may be intended with respect to the minimal regular norm.

Once fixed a defining representation πn, a net [formula] of von Neumann algebras is canonically associated to a Weyl algebra net, by

[formula]

If [formula] then [formula] is the C*-algebra generated by the von Neumann algebras [formula], so that we may define [formula]. Hence, [formula] and [formula] are the C* and von Neumann algebras generated by additivity on the index set P.

In particular, [formula] is the C*-algebra generated by all the local von Neumann algebras [formula], for I∈I. It is called the C*-algebra of quasi local elements of the net [formula] and is the C*-algebra referred to in studying the DHR superselection sectors of the net, with respect to the index set I. The net and this C*-algebra are usually both indicated by the same symbol N.

Nets for the Streater and Wilde model

To define useful nets for the study of the Streater and Wilde model, a proper definition of localization is now in order: for j = a,  b,  c,  q,  e,  f we define the localization of a generic element [formula] as

[formula]

According to this definition, the various nets of symplectic subspaces Vj,P  ⊆  Vf,P with range category [formula] are defined: explicitly Vj,I is given by

[formula]

Observe that the elements [formula], with [formula], have vanishing localization Weyl unitaries according to the definition in equation ([\ref=e:localization]), so that they may be thought as localized in any interval of the time zero line.

A possible first result for the model, is a complete simple current extension characterization of the nets of von Neumann algebras, derived from the nets of symplectic subspaces in the six term inclusion of symplectic spaces in diagram ([\ref=e:def_inclusion_symplectic]), in the representations defined in Section [\ref=s:SW_model]. To obtain such a result, we show the existence of local symplectic isomorphisms obtained from a natural local choice of the regularizing element T∈Vf. Such a characterization will be used in Section [\ref=ss:gaugess] to discuss the existence of the relative gauge simmetry groups.

The following result collects the local properties of the symplectic isomorphism ψT, according to the relative position of [formula] and of the localized algebras. Observe that for [formula] we have [formula]. We omit for brevity the reference to the symplectic form of the symplectic subspaces involved, and always suppose that the nets are defined on a fixed index set P.

Let [formula] be a generic non void open subset of the time zero real line and ψT be a symplectic isomorphism defined as in Proposition [\ref=p:_psif] for [formula]. Letting [formula] be the generic element in [formula], we have

Proof. i) The case [formula] is trivial. If [formula] and P are not disjoint, then

[formula]

is a proper subset of [formula], that does not split into a symplectic sum. Moreover

[formula]

The decompositions for ψT(Vq(P)) and ψT(Ve(P)) are in the proof of ii) below. ii) The definition of ψT as in Proposition [\ref=p:_psif] for generic [formula] and domain P gives

[formula]

and similarly for the other local symplectic subspaces. Taking [formula], the results follow.   [formula] Observe that whatever [formula] and P are, with [formula], the local algebra A(Va(P)) defined as in equation ([\ref=e:nets_von_weyl]) satisfies

[formula]

Similarly we define from the symplectic local subspaces of Vb,Vc,Vq,Ve and Vf the nets B,C,Q,E and F respectively. Remembering that we also indicated by C and Q the additive groups of the charges, we denote without ambiguity by U(C) and U(Q) their unitary Weyl representations on HL and HM respectively.

Recalling that in Remark [\ref=r:isom], for chosen T∈Vf we denoted by ΨT the isomorphism at the Weyl algebra level obtained from the symplectic space isomorphism ψT by the Weyl functor, we use the same symbol ΨT for its extension to the von Neumann algebras, so that from the representation πf to the representation [formula], it holds [formula], for every T∈Vf.

Hence, denoting the Abelian algebra of the symplectic subspace N in representation πb by

[formula]

the above Proposition and the isomorphism ΨT, give the following characterization of the nets involved, as simple current extensions from the net of observables:

For given [formula] a generic non void subset of the line and for notations as above we have

Proof. From the Proposition [\ref=p:_l_t_sy_i], by functoriality and the splitting of the representation.   [formula]

Chiral versus time zero formulation

We introduce in the sequel the chiral formulation of the scalar massless free field nets: this allows one to relate the time zero approach to the Streater and Wilde original one and to the conformal chiral one given by Buchholz, Mack and Todorov in [\cite=bmt88].

To fix notation, let [formula] be the observable net of the Streater and Wilde model on the index set of the double cones K of the 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime M.

If I∈I is a time zero open interval and O = I''∈K is the open double cone it generates by causal completion, i.e. the interior of the causal closure of the interval I, the net [formula] has time zero generating net [formula], i.e. it holds [formula].

A wherever based double cone, is described as O = I+  ×  I-, for I±∈I±, the index set of the open bounded intervals on the right/left light ray lines, see e.g. [\cite=reh00].

The Streater and Wilde original model in [\cite=sw70] is formulated in the left/right chiral fields formalism and, for every chiral component, it gives a family labeled by [formula] of DHR automorphisms for the net [formula]. Disliking this, we preferred to write the symplectic spaces and nets in a time zero formulation and then, using the symplectic isomorphism ψT defined in Proposition [\ref=p:_psif], we extracted the charge content. To relate the two approaches, and to discuss the geometric covariance properties, we may use a second symplectic isomorphism constructed as in the sequel.

In the chiral approach, the symplectic spaces are given by the smearing test functions of the left/right mover solutions θ± of the classical wave equation, i.e. (∂t  ±  ∂x)θ± = 0.

To consider the charge carrying fields, we have to restrict to the functions [formula] with ∂θ±∈S and a general solution of the wave equation can be written as

[formula]

To give a symplectic isomorphism between the two formulation, we start from a direct application of the d'Alambert formula: if [formula], we have

[formula]

Denoted by [formula] a chiral symplectic space support, and by

[formula]

two symplectic forms on V, we can hence define the left/right chiral symplectic spaces of the fields by V+: = (V,σ+) and V-: = (V,σ-).

Consider now the isomorphism ψ of real linear spaces defined by

[formula]

where the direct and inverse transformations are explicitly given by

[formula]

Define moreover for every [formula] the two real constants

[formula]

where

[formula]

Observe that for F∈Vf and Θ  =  ψ(F), this pair of constants is given by

[formula]

Introducing the (continuous) real valued [formula]-linear form [formula] such that α(a,b) = ab, we may denote by σ∞ the usual symplectic form on [formula], defined by

[formula]

and finally state the following

There exists a non splitting symplectic isomorphism ψ∞, equating the isomorphism ψ of equation ([\ref=e:dala_psie]) as a real linear space isomorphism, defined by

[formula]

such that for the symplectic forms it holds

[formula]

The corresponding Weyl algebras isomorphism is

[formula]

where in the 2-cocycle z- = (β,y), the action β is defined by the α appearing in equation ([\ref=e:simp_infyn]) and the [formula]-valued function y is defined by the symplectic form σ-.

Proof. The proof it trivial, it is enough to reefer to the general case treated in Subsection [\ref=ss:_isom_twist], in particular to the equations ([\ref=e:azione_prodotto]) and ([\ref=e:cociclo_prodotto]) for the definition of z-. Observe that the part σ∞ in the symplectic form, corresponds to the interacting part of σf (actually denoted by σV+,V- according to the notation of Subsection [\ref=ss:_isom_twist]).   [formula] Various observations are now in order:

Picking a point at infinity [formula] in the limits of the integrals appearing in equations ([\ref=e:dalatrsf]) is necessary in order to define ψ∞ and σ∞. The choice ∞   =  -   ∞   gives [formula], so that the interacting part σ∞ of the symplectic form depends only on the limit value of the functions at +    ∞  .

The space ψ∞(Vf) is not a direct sum because ψ∞ is not splitting. As a consequence, the Weyl algebra Ψ∞(W(Vf,σf)) is not a tensor product but a twisted crossed product of Weyl algebras. Changing the role of V+ and V- in the equation ([\ref=e:twist_infty]) we also have [formula], where now the 2-cocycle z+ is given in terms of α and σ+. To make evident the symmetry behind this construction, and its physical significance, we use the following notation

[formula]

where the symbol [formula] accounts for the twisted interaction operated by σ∞ between the two chiral field algebras at the chosen point ∞  .

For S the Schwartz space of functions on the chiral line and [formula] we define the two chiral symplectic space of observables as Va±: = (Va,σ±)  ⊂  (V±,σ±). Choosing ∞   =  -   ∞   we have [formula], for any [formula]. Hence σ∞ vanishes, independently of the choice of ∞   we made, when at least one of its arguments is in Va+ or Va-. We may interpret this as and independence relation, given by the vanishing of the commutator at ∞   between any field of one chirality and any observable of the other chirality.

The isomorphism ψ∞ splits when restricted to the observable symplectic subspace, i.e. it hold [formula], and we have

[formula]

The (vacuum) states of the algebras W(Va±,σ±), i.e. the quasi-free state on the chiral observables algebras W(Va±,σ±), are defined for θ∈Va± and [formula] by

[formula]

Similarly to the time zero formulation, the GNS construction from these states gives Fock space representation on the Hilbert spaces Ha±, with chiral one particle spaces Ha±: = Ta±(Va±)-, and GNS (vacuum) vector Ωa±, see for example [\cite=bmt88] for details. From these representations of the chiral observable algebras, we can obtain the non-regular representations of the chiral field algebras, using the regularizing elements tool of Subsection [\ref=ss:WSW_model] as follows.

Initially we observe that a simple relation between the charges carried by a field in the two formulations is also obtained from the d'Alambert formula ([\ref=e:dala]). The charges carried by [formula] are the pair [formula] where

[formula]

If F∈Vf and if c± are the charges of ψ∞(F) = ΘF, we have

[formula]

In particular we have that (Fc,Fq) = (0,0) iff (c+,c-) = (0,0).

Consider now two copies of the elementary symplectic space, defined in Subsection [\ref=ss:Elementary_Weyl_algebras], that we denote by (L±,σL), with [formula]. Let moreover ωL± be the non-regular states on the Weyl algebras W(L±,σL) respectively, defined as in equation ([\ref=e:state_NT]) by ωL±(W((c±,n±)) = δc±,0, for (c±,n±)∈L± and δ the Kronecker delta.

A regularizing element for the left field movers (similarly for the right movers case), is a non vanishing charge element S+, i.e. S∈V+  /  Va+. We can choose it such that [formula] for simplicity. Then, as in Proposition [\ref=p:_psif], there exist a regularizing isomorphism

[formula]

where the charge c+  =   lim y  →    +    ∞θ(y) -  lim y  →    -    ∞θ(y) and [formula]. Observe that c+ = 0 if θ∈Va+  ⊂  V+. Similarly, we obtain (c-,n-)∈L- and, as in Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case], it is easy to see that two non-regular states ω± on W(V±,σ±) respectively, are defined by

[formula]

with non separable GNS representation spaces [formula] respectively.

A state for the algebra [formula] is defined by

[formula]

for the element [formula] associated to the pair [formula], with charges [formula]. Observe that the definition of the state ω∞ above is well posed, in fact once we write the obvious algebraic isomorphism

[formula]

the condition ([\ref=e:condition_2_weyl]) of Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case] is satisfied because for the state [formula] it holds ωC(W(c+,c-)) = δ(0,0),(c+,c-).

Moreover, the choice of the point at infinity ∞   (note that the values of the functions at the point at infinity are not involved in the definition of ω∞) and of the regularizing elements S±∈V±, defines the state ω∞ uniquely, up to isomorphism, as in point i) of Proposition [\ref=p:rappre].

From the GNS representations [formula] of the Weyl algebras W(V±,σ±) respectively, we obtain for the non-regular GNS representation of the state ω∞ :

[formula]

For the Hilbert spaces H∞ of this representation it holds [formula], i.e. π∞ is unitarily equivalent to the representation πf. In fact, for [formula] we have

[formula]

We pass now to define the chiral and 1+1-dimensional nets of the fields and their relation with the time zero one.

For a time zero based double cone O = I'' = I+  ×  I-, with I∈I and I±∈I±, we have:

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the twisted crossed product for the point at infinity obtained in the above equation ([\ref=e:_rinfty]) and F±:I±  ↦  π±(W(V±(I±))'' are the chiral field nets on the non separable Hilbert spaces H± defined, for I±∈I± the light ray intervals, from the localized symplectic space [formula].

The observable chiral nets are defined on the separable Hilbert Fock spaces Ha± by

[formula]

and the following equality holds for O as above

[formula]

As a last observation, notice that if [formula] is the time zero subspace defined in above Subsection [\ref=ss:WSW_model], than [formula], because [formula]. Hence ψ∞(N) generates the diagonal constant elements in the field, and it holds

[formula]

i.e. the common Abelian von Neumann subalgebra of the local left and right movers is isomorphic to the non trivial center Zb of the time zero net B.

It is well known that the 1+1-dimensional observable net [formula], in the vacuum representation [formula], satisfies (see [\cite=sw70] [\cite=hl82] [\cite=bgl93] for this model and [\cite=kl04] for a general formulation):

covariance under the action of [formula], the universal covering group of the Möbius group on M, implemented by a continuous, unitary, positive energy representation that we denote by [formula];

Reeh-Schlieder property for [formula] relative to the cyclic and separating vector Ωa∈Ha (and also for the net A, relative to the same vector, and for A± relative to Ωa±∈Ha±); and

the local algebras [formula] ([formula] and A±(I±)) appear as type III1 factors.

Moreover, as a consequence of the modular theory for the local algebras and of the Möbius covariance, it is also shown in [\cite=hl82] that we have

Haag duality for the net [formula], with respect to the double cone index set K (respectively of [formula] w.r.t. the index set I and nets A± w.r.t. the index sets I±);

timelike duality for the net [formula], w.r.t. the index set K, and

unitary equivalence of the local algebras [formula] with any local algebras defined by additivity on bounded simply connected regions or wedges in M (respectively of the algebra [formula] and the algebra defined by additivity on the half lines, in time zero formulation).

DHR sectors for the observable net [formula]

We begin this section recalling some basic facts about DHR superselection theory, see e.g. [\cite=rob00].

Given a directed index set P and a von Neumann algebras net [formula] in representation πn, it holds [formula]. The DHR superselection sectors of [formula] are described by the W*-category [formula] defined as follows:

objects: the representations π of [formula] such that

π is a representation in [formula], i.e. [formula] for P∈P;

π satisfies the DHR superselection criterion, i.e.

[formula]

arrows: the intertwiners between these representations, i.e. operators [formula] such that for any P∈P and [formula] we have

[formula]

By [\cite=dhr69I] [\cite=dhr71] it is possible to analyze [formula] in terms of the tensor W*-category Tt of localized transportable endomorphisms of the net [formula] (if P is directed this is actually an equivalence of W*-categories). The correspondence functor is given on the objects of Tt by [formula], for ρ∈Tt and [formula]. This functor allows one to reduce the study of all the representations to the Hilbert space Hn, with intertwiners defined as in equation ([\ref=e:intretww]).

In our case, using the above recalled identification of [formula] and Tt, we define for any F∈Vf(I) that carries the charges [formula] a DHR representation for the nets [formula] and [formula], by the adjoint action automorphism ρIF obtained by F and localized in I, such that

[formula]

For the representations in [formula] the covariance property under the action of a geometrical symmetry group of the spacetime is a standard requirement.

In our model, in order to define and discuss such a covariance and the positivity of the energy for the net [formula] and for the introduced subsidiary nets, we have to pass to the 1+1-dimensional theory. In fact it is well known that if [formula] is a (Poincaré or M ) translation covariant net on the index set K of the double cones in a 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime M, its time zero restriction net [formula] is only a space-translation covariant net, without spectrum condition, see for example [\cite=klm01].

A representation π of a net [formula] is said to be Möbius covariant if there exist a unitary representation [formula] of the group [formula] on the Hilbert space [formula] such that, for any double cone O = I+  ×  I- and element [formula] in the connected neighborhood U of the identity element of the covering of the Möbius group, we have

[formula]

Returning to the Streater and Wilde model, if we take F∈Vf(I) implementing the sector automorphism ρIF and the representation [formula] as in equation ([\ref=e:sector_autom]) labeled by the charges [formula], we may pass to the chiral formulation using the symplectic isomorphism ψ∞ of Lemma [\ref=l:chiral]. For given the chiral charges [formula], see equation ([\ref=e:cariche_trasf]), we have a unitary representation of [formula] on the subspace

[formula]

For every chiral charge c±∈C±, and for Ha± the observables separable Hilbert space, we have the Hilbert space equivalence [formula], but carrying different representations. If this equivalence is given by the unitaries Y±:Ha±  →  Hc± and if Ua± are the representations of the Möbius group on Ha± respectively, then we may define by [formula] the unitary representations of the Möbius group on the Hilbert spaces Hc±. The representations of the same group on [formula] are defined by [formula].

Denote now by ξ±∈I± the coordinates on ray light lines, and take an element [formula], i.e. with [formula], and charges equal to (c+,c-). For a given DHR representation [formula], and for any [formula], the symmetry group representation Uc+,c- acts as

[formula]

Observe that it is not necessary to define the action of the Möbius group on the two left/right chirality points at infinity ∞  ±, that not even explicitly appear in the action of the representation Uc+,c- for no [formula]. In fact it is possible to choose ∞  + not contained in the left supports I+ of Θ, and take the open connected neighborhood U such to remain with ∞  +∉g+I+, for every (g+,g-)∈U, and similarly for ∞  -.

Moreover, the defined representation Uc+,c- may also be used in restriction to the elements of the chiral observable net [formula] in any representation [formula].

Finally, the covariance of the vacuum representation [formula] of the field net [formula] is also easily obtained, defining the Möbius group representation by

[formula]

under the proper notion of convergence, i.e. summing up on finite sets of charges [formula]. The same result holds for the time zero formulation, under the isomorphisms seen above.

After this excursion on the chiral formulation and the representation of the Möbius group, the reason why we choose time zero description is going to be clear in a moment.

Solitonic sectors appeared as part of AQFT in [\cite=rob76], for a general formulation see also [\cite=fro76] [\cite=reh97]. In the Streater and Wilde model this notion emerge for the sectors of the intermediate net [formula], that turn out to be similar to a class studied in [\cite=mug99] for massive and conformal field theories.

For I∈I, we define its left and right causally disjoint sets [formula], by [formula] and [formula], and use the following

Let [formula] be a net in the defining representation πn, and let K be a group with a local action α on the net [formula]. A translation covariant representation π of the net [formula] is said to be a K-solitonic representation with support I∈I if there exist h,k∈K such that for any [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

A K-solitonic automorphism ρIk,h of the net [formula] is a net automorphism such that [formula] is a solitonic representation with support I∈I, i.e. [formula] and [formula].

We remember other notions, presented e.g. in [\cite=mug01] [\cite=mug04], also useful for the case at hand.

If K is a (finite) compact group and [formula] is the fixed-point net of [formula] under the action of K so that the DHR sectors of the net [formula] are described by K-solitonic automorphisms of net [formula], we speak of an orbifold model; moreover, such a model is said to be holomorphic if the net [formula] has only trivial superselection sectors. Starting from a 1+1-dimensional net [formula], with time zero restriction [formula], being the solitonic automorphisms not locally normal at infinity, it is only as representations of the fixed-point subnet [formula], with time zero restriction [formula], that they represent true positive energy DHR sectors.

In the Streater and Wilde model the properties of the sector automorphisms of the observable net [formula] (and [formula]) implemented by the Weyl elements of the auxiliary nets, are collected in the following result, where geometric covariance properties are also discussed

In the above notation, we have

Moreover, if  lim x  →    ±    ∞f1(x) = F±∈N and if [formula], we have

or if [formula] we have

The elements in [formula] intertwine solitonic automorphisms with the same values of Fq = F+ - F-, preserving supports, if localized with the same support as the automorphisms. Such automorphisms turn out to be DHR sector automorphisms in restriction to the nets [formula] and [formula], localized in I, with charge Fq∈Q and intertwiners in [formula] and [formula] respectively;

Proof. i) The transportability is a result of a simple calculation, see for example [\cite=sw70], and using the correspondence of the given automorphism sectors on the time zero axes. Moreover [formula] satisfies Definition [\ref=d:soliton] for the group N, since

[formula]

is a strongly continuous unitary representation of N on the Hilbert space Hf, acting locally on the net [formula]. ii) and iii). It is easy to check the DHR superselection criterion requirements for such automorphisms, relatively to the indicated nets. In particular, to show the equivalence in iii) it is enough to observe that the map

[formula]

defines an automorphism for the net [formula] with the required properties. Positivity of the energy and Poincaré covariance of [formula] is proved in [\cite=sw70]. The Möbius covariance is proved using the chiral formulation and the representation of the Möbius group given in equation ([\ref=e:covariance_reps]).   [formula]

1) Notice that the time zero formulation of Proposition [\ref=p:sectors_autom] distinguishes between the different nature of the two families of DHR automorphisms obtained for the net A: the ones in i) are the restriction of solitonic automorphisms of the bigger net C; the ones in ii) instead are the restriction of DHR automorphisms of the bigger net Q. Similarly for the net [formula] because of iii). In the following Subsection [\ref=ss:gaugess], the net A is characterized as the fixed-point subnet of Q under the action of a compact gauge group Gq, i.e. A  =  QGq. Using the discussion and terminology in [\cite=klx04], we say that the automorphisms in i) give twisted representations of A and the ones in ii) untwisted, relatively to the representation of the net Q. In contrast, the chiral approach describes the sectors as indistinguished restrictions of solitonic automorphisms on the light lines. 2) In the general situation treated in [\cite=mug99], the split property for the net is required in order to construct disorder operators that implement the solitonic automorphisms; in the Streater and Wilde case such operators are directly given as Weyl elements in the larger algebras.

Gauge symmetry group

We consider in the sequel the gauge automorphisms defined on net [formula].

The general theory in [\cite=dhr69I] [\cite=dhr69II], the construction of the Weyl algebras sector automorphisms and the structure of simple current extensions in ii) of Proposition [\ref=p:split_local_lag], suggest looking for gauge symmetries in the dual of the charge group [formula]. We also recall the results iii) and iv) in Proposition [\ref=p:_elem_weyl_rep], where the properties of the elementary Weyl algebra on the symplectic space [formula], in non-regular representation, are displayed. Of particular relevance is the Bohr compactification of N.

Consider the introduced two Abelian groups: the charge group [formula] furnished with the discrete topology and the additive group [formula] as defined in the symplectic isomorphism in Subsection [\ref=ss:WSW_model] and furnished with the usual topology of [formula].

Consider moreover the Abelian group of all characters on [formula], i.e. the group of all the functions [formula] such that χ(s + s')  =  χ(s)χ(s') for [formula], with the identity function as neutral element and complex conjugation as inverse. If we furnish this group with the compact-open topology, that coincides with the pointwise convergence topology, [formula] being discrete, we obtain an Abelian compact group we denote by G, because of the Pontryagin duality theorem.

Moreover, the group G is isomorphic to the Bohr compactification of G0, i.e. the closure of the group G0 in the compact-open topology defined above.

Observe that the group G0 is identified with the subgroup of the characters of [formula] that correspond to strongly continuous one dimensional representation of [formula], with the usual topology. This means that under the groups morphism the elements of G0 are the elements χ(n,r) of G with the property that for [formula] the map [formula] is continuous. The properties collected in the following result, authorize to call G the gauge group of the net A, at least relatively to the net F.

The map defined by satisfies:

This automorphism group acts strictly locally on the net [formula] and on the 1+1-dimensional net [formula], commuting with the action of the Möbius group on the net [formula], represented on [formula] as in equation ([\ref=e:mgroup_f]) and acting on the subspace of fixed charges (c+,c-) as in equation ([\ref=e:covariance_reps]);

Moreover, for the Abelian compact group G defined above, we have:

Proof. Strong continuity in i) and iv) holds because the group G0 is represented by V using only the regular subspace [formula] of the representation [formula] and, by density, extends to elements in G because of the universal property of Bohr compactification, see [\cite=DI]. ii) The invariance of the subspace Ha and of the vector Ωf hold because of the factorization property of the state [formula], and of its GNS representation, as illustrated in Proposition [\ref=P:factor_state_weyl_case]. iii) For the elements in G0 this is trivial, because the action is implemented by Weyl elements. The commutation of the action with the action of the Möbius group derives from the invariance of charges and the [formula]-valued action of the latter group. iv) results from the discussion above. In particular, the locality of the action for elements of G not in G0 holds, because it is [formula]-valued. v) by the Pontryagin's duality theorem. vi) follows from the general case in [\cite=dhr69I], averaging over the compact group G, or the indicated subgroups, with respect to the Haar measure, in the one dimensional representation fixed by specifying the charges of the Weyl generators.   [formula]

Observe that the previous introduction of a non splitting isomorphism, i.e. of a regularizing element T∈Vf, has been also useful to simplify the proofs of the Propositions [\ref=p:sectors_autom] and [\ref=p:_two_groups]. Actually this isomomorphism corresponds to a section [formula], where Δc is the group of the covariant DHR automorphisms and [formula] the one of the inner automorphisms of A. This section gives a group homomorphism, as said in [\cite=dhr69II] and a similar choice is also made in a non trivial center situation, as illustrated in [\cite=bl02].

Having established the existence of the superselection automorphisms and their relative gauge groups, the following diagram concerns the full meaning of the simple current extension diagram seen in ([\ref=e:SW_general_inclusion_of_net]):

Notice that

the vertical lines describe fixed-point restrictions under the action of the compact subgroup Gq; dually they account for (twisted) DHR sectors of [formula] and [formula] and solitonic (automorphism) sectors for [formula];

the horizontal lines describe fixed-point restrictions under the action of the compact subgroup Gc; dually they account for (untwisted) DHR sectors of nets [formula] and [formula].

To conclude, it worth recalling that such a kind of diagrams is present in other situation where the sectors of a net are obtained along two different extension procedures, through partial field nets, see e.g. the square of nets in [\cite=reh97] [\cite=mug99]. For a general explanation of these features in terms of braided crossed G-categories, for G a finite gauge group, see [\cite=mug04]. Regarding the last cited paper, it is to observe that in the Streater and Wilde model only the discrete subgroup [formula] is present in the description of solitonic sectors, and not the entire gauge group.
