Dark-matter particles and baryons from inflation and spontaneous CP violation in the early universe

There is a relevant open question in relation to a hypothetical, brief inflationary period in the expansion of the early universe, initiated by the energy density of a scalar field. The question is whether the energy density in cold dark matter, and a very small energy density in an effective cosmological constant can arise in the early universe from the fields involved in the dynamics of inflation. Also, one can ask whether a spontaneous CP violation is related to the vacuum expectation value of a pseudoscalar field involved in the dynamics of inflation, and whether this dynamics might contain a reason for the actual, small value of the baryon to photon ratio, a few times 10- 10 (alternatively, for the empirical number of baryons, a few times 1078). In this paper, we describe several properties of a model which contains a scalar inflaton field with a large vacuum expectation value [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref2] at a calculated [\cite=ref3] [\cite=ref1], potential minimum, and also a related pseudoscalar field, whose small vacuum expectation value breaks CP invariance spontaneously [\cite=ref2]. These properties, taken together, suggest specific affirmative answers to the above questions.

In contrast to most models for the appearance of radiation and matter near the end of inflation [\cite=ref4] [\cite=ref5] [\cite=ref6], the present model separates into two distinct dynamical mechanisms the hypothetical origin of primary cold dark matter and the origin of the primary radiation. The required "initial" energy densities are vastly different: at ~  10- 36  , ~  1036  4 in primary cold dark matter, and ~  1060  4 in (hot) radiation. The two are decoupled in this model. Inflation occurs when the classical scalar field φ is at a calculated [\cite=ref3] [\cite=ref1] potential maximum, at [\cite=ref1] the Planck energy scale MP = 1.2  ×  1019  , or just above [\cite=ref3] this scale. Inflation approaches termination as φ "falls" to a calculated [\cite=ref3] [\cite=ref1] potential minimum,F2 taken here at about φ  =  φc = 1018  . Consider, as an example of the mechanism, that bosonic quanta (S) with mass [formula], which subsequently decay into radiation with an energy density of the order of [formula], can be produced by a coupling to the energy of motion [formula] of the inflaton field, as its potential energy density is diminishing. It is noteworthy that a typical, initial [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref3] potential energy density is of this order of magnitude; in particular, λφ4  →    ~  6  ×  1062  4 for φ  →    ~  MP and with a small self-coupling parameter λ  ~  3  ×  10- 14 [\cite=ref7] [\cite=ref6]. An estimated order of magnitude of the time for conversion of the initial, inflaton potential ("vacuum") energy into S quanta is [formula]. A time for S decay has been estimated [\cite=ref2] to be ~  10- 36   (for [formula]); this is then the approximate time for the appearance of radiation. The entropy in the volume V  ~  (4π / 3)(3  )3, which evolves to the presently observable universe (with radial dimension taken here as r0  ~  1.5  ×  1028  ) is then about 1.4  ×  1088. The simplest estimate for evolution to the present epoch gives the radiation energy density of approximately (1060  4)(10- 36 / 1012)2(1012 / 4  ×  1017)8 / 3  ~  1.25  ×  10- 51  4, when ~  1012   is used as the approximate time for matter dominance, and ~  4  ×  1017   as the present age. The above sequence for the appearance of radiation is meant to be illustrative of a possibility. Our main concerns in this paper are the creation of cold dark matter and the origin of the baryon asymmetry, to which we turn.

Consider the production of cold dark-matter particles near to the end of inflation, just before 10- 36   (just prior to S decay, the appearance of radiation). Without inflation, the causal horizon would be at a dimension of ~  3  ×  10- 26  ; thus there would be ~  1078 causally disconnected volume elements within [formula]. Inflation of scale by ~  1026(  ~  e60) rapidly expands the causal dimension to cover the dimension of about 3  , which corresponds to the radial size of the the region at 10- 36   which subsequently expands to the presently observable universe. Near to the end of inflation, dark-matter particles φ (inflatons) with an estimated [\cite=ref2] [\cite=ref1] mass [formula], can be created by a time-varying gravitational field.[\cite=ref5] [\cite=ref6] This mass is determined by φc and λ, independently of the possible contribution to the dark-matter energy density, and independently of the Hubble expansion rate. The Hubble expansion rate is H  ~  1 / 10- 36    =  6.6  ×  1011  . Thus H is [formula]. Stated alternatively, VH4 / mφ  ~  1078. Gravitational production of essentially a condensate of φ particles can produce a number density nφ  ~  εH3, and an energy density ρφ  ~  εH3mφ, where [formula].[\cite=ref5] The factor (1 - 6ξ) is related to a hypothetical small [\cite=ref5] deviation from conformal invariance for field and (massless) particle coupling. For creation of φ particles, we consider this factor to be representative of an effective suppression factor, when mφ  ~  H. Taking as an example of an effective suppression factor, |1 - 6ξ|  ~  1.7  ×  10- 5, gives ε  ~  7.5  ×  10- 12, a number similar to that previously estimated [\cite=ref1] for small field fluctuations; one then obtains ~  3  ×  1067 dark-matter φ particles. Their (metastable [\cite=ref1]) presence would give a present cold dark-matter energy density of about [formula], which is about 23% of critical, in agreement with cosmological data.[\cite=ref8]

The cosmological, chiral model [\cite=ref2] contains a pseudoscalar field b, in addition to the scalar inflaton field φ. When the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at φ  =  φc, the quanta of the b field are the necessary massless Goldstone bosons,[\cite=ref9] just as the pions are the Goldstone bosons in the σ-model for nucleon (equivalently, constituent quark) mass in low-energy particle physics.[\cite=ref10] [\cite=ref11] We have examined some consequences [\cite=ref2] [\cite=ref12] of the hypothesis that the vacuum expectation value of the b field has a nonzero value Fb. CP invariance is then spontaneously broken.[\cite=ref13] The small scale of Fb  ~  5.5   is estimated independently by the hypothesis [\cite=ref2] that it gives rise to mass for a neutrino. Two results [\cite=ref2] following from Fb  ≠  0 provide motivation for the hypothesis.

A significant asymmetry between the number of antineutrinos and the number of neutrinos can be generated in the early universe in a non-equilibrium, primary decay process, involving necessary, CP-violating final-state interactions from exchange of b quanta. This asymmetry might be partly transformed into a baryon asymmetry at the time of electroweak symmetry breaking. Below, we try to explain the empirical numerical value of the baryon asymmetry, from its possible seeding by a primary antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry.

There is a small vacuum energy density associated with the b field, of magnitude [formula]. This is explicitly related to a small neutrino mass, through Fb. Clearly, the very small value of λ for the self-coupling of the bosons in the chiral model, also is crucial for the size of this effective cosmological constant.

In the evolution from ~  10- 36   to the time of electroweak symmetry breaking, ~  10- 12  , the radial dimension of ~  3   expands to 3  ×  1012  . An intrinsic baryon dimension is [formula]. There are ~  3  ×  1078 such volume elements. With ~  3  ×  1087 neutrinos (of one flavor) in the radiation, a CP-violating asymmetry in number density produced in an early S decay mode of, for example [formula], as has been estimated [\cite=ref2], results in 3  ×  1078 excess [formula], or about one per volume element with [formula]. The hypothetical [\cite=ref14] [\cite=ref15] transitions [formula] quarks occur in each volume element; this could result in ~  3  ×  1078 baryons when the confinement transition occurs at ~  10- 6  , where baryons form from three quarks. At this time, the energy densities of baryons and dark matter, [formula] and [formula] are fixed. We have the ratio [formula]; thereafter both energy densities fall like matter densities to the present. The model thus contains a tentative explanation for the rather small absolute number of baryons. The ratio of baryon to dark-matter energy densities agrees well with cosmological and other data [\cite=ref8]. Of course, the primary antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry could be larger than the ~  10- 9 used in the above numerical example.[\cite=ref2] The suggestion here is that then, very many more than ~  3  ×  1078 baryons cannot be accommodated; many more will not form within the available ~  3  ×  1078 volume elements with [formula]. (There are arguments that the baryon asymmetry could have been much larger, say up to one hundred times, with reference to "a priori" permissable amounts of primordial [formula] and [formula].[\cite=ref16]) In the present model, there is a natural expectation of a residual antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry; this asymmetry could well be larger than the baryon asymmetry.[\cite=ref2]

Before concluding, we discuss consequences of a speculation that the (metastable) dark-matter particles are not the very massive, scalar inflaton quanta φ,[\cite=ref1] but rather the Goldstone boson-like pseudoscalar quanta b. When Fb  ≠  0, the b particles have a quite small mass, estimated [\cite=ref2] to be [formula]. The chiral-like model for related (explicitly through λ) scalar and pseudoscalar quanta in the early universe thus contains both a high energy scale φc (or mφ) and a small energy scale Fb (or mb), with the large ratio [formula]. Consider the hypothesis that the condensate of φ particles becomes effectively a condensate of b particles with of order (φc / Fb) b particles per φ particle. The primary energy density in dark-matter particles is unchanged. The total number of dark-matter degrees of freedom increases, from ~  3  ×  1067 to ~  5.5  ×  1093. This could further ensure dark-matter smoothness.[\cite=ref12] Only small fluctuations in the radiation temperature are induced (see Appendix). This suggests that fluctuations may become smaller at the largest angular scales (the largest dimensions). This might be a feature of the temperature fluctuation measurements in the CMB.[\cite=ref8]

In summary, we have discussed certain positive aspects of a model which attempts to unify the creation of cold dark matter, a CP-violating baryon asymmetry, and also a small residual vacuum energy density, in the early universe. Predictions include a significant antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry, and the possibility of a diminution of CMB temperature fluctuations at the largest angular scales. As in all such models,[\cite=ref4] it is difficult to test experimentally in an unambiguous way, particle-physics pictures of the earliest time interval in the universe. One tends to be somewhat reliant upon the possibly circumstantial representation of important global facts, as in the present model. Despite this reservation, two essential ideas which the model incorporates, seem worthwhile to explore. One idea is that spontaneous CP violation arises from the nonzero vacuum expectation value of a primary, Goldstone boson-like pseudoscalar field related to the inflaton field, with the smallness of the vacuum expectation value being related to a small neutrino mass. A second idea is that of different dynamical mechanisms for the creation of cold dark-matter particles, and for the creation of radiation. If b particles constitute cold dark matter, then both dark-matter mass and an effective cosmological constant arise from the same field variable Fb, which variable gives spontaneous CP violation leading to the baryon asymmetry. This is a dynamical unification.

Appendix

The empirical number that characterizes CMB temperature fluctuations on small angular scales is of the order of 10- 5 at the decoupling time.[\cite=ref8] It could have been significantly larger, apriori. When interpreted as a consequence of fluctuations in the gravitational potential at the decoupling time, it is perhaps interesting that the presence then of N nearly-distinct aggregates of dark matter with mass of order 5  ×  1069   and with dimension of about 1022  , within a region with dimension of about 1024  , can give a (Gaussian) temperature fluctuation [\cite=ref4] of the order of [formula], for a maximum N determined by available volume, N  ~  (1024 / 1022)3  =  106. It is noteworthy that such a hypothetical dark-matter "pre-galaxy" can have a mean energy density which becomes greater than a falling "background" dark-matter energy density, somewhat after the decoupling time. Visible galaxies would tend to form early from stars in these seed systems (in about 108 yr). Rich [formula] galactic clusters with in-falling, KeV-temperature cluster gas, form later (in > 109 yr), as observations indicate.[\cite=ref17] Also, there is a suggestion here that mass correlations even greater than of order 1015 solar masses (superclusters) can develop from the early seeds.

Finally we note that from the relation in the last sentence of footnote F10, the present ideas could possibly contain a reason for the usual postulated [\cite=ref4], empirically necessary, small value pf the dimensionless parameter λ. This is that λ2 is given by the small ratio of the two vacuum expectation values, for Goldstone-like pseudoscalar field and inflaton scalar field, which fields constitute the basis of the inflation model with a spontaneously-broken CP invariance: [formula], with Fb related to a residual vacuum energy density and to neutrino mass.
