Introduction

Duadic codes are a family of cyclic codes over fields that generalize quadratic residue codes to composite lengths. For a general introduction, see [\cite=fundamentals], [\cite=leon_et_al] and [\cite=smid]. It can be determined when an extended duadic code is self-dual for the Euclidean scalar product ([\cite=fundamentals]). In this work, we study for which n there exist duadic codes over q2 of length n the extension of which by a suitable parity-check is self-dual for the Hermitian scalar product [formula].

First, we characterize the Hermitian self-orthogonal cyclic codes by their defining sets (Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.11.1]), then the duadic codes (Proposition [\ref=Thm_6.4.1.1]). Next, we study under what conditions the extension by a parity-check of a duadic code is Hermitian self-dual (Proposition [\ref=Thm_6.4.14.1]). Finally, we derive by elementary means an arithmetic condition bearing on the divisors of n (Theorem [\ref=Thm_3.17]) for the previous situation. This condition was arrived at in [\cite=conchita] using representation theory of groups. In an appendix, we derive asymptotic estimates for x large on Aq(x), the number of integers ≤  x that are split by the multiplier μ- q, and on Dq(x), the number of possible lengths ≤  x of a duadic code. The proofs are based on analytic number theory.

Preliminaries

We assume the reader is familiar with the theory of cyclic codes (see e.g., [\cite=intro_in_handbook], [\cite=fundamentals]). Let q be a power of a prime p and let q denote the Galois field with q elements. Let n be a positive integer such that gcd(n,q) = 1. Let Rn  =  q[x]  /  (xn - 1). We view a cyclic code over q of length n as an ideal in Rn.

Let 0  <  s  <  n be a nonnegative integer. Let [formula] , where rs is the smallest positive integer such that [formula]. The coset Cs is called the q-cyclotomic coset of s modulo n. The subscript of Cs is usually taken to be the smallest number in the set and is also taken as the coset representative. The distinct q-cyclotomic cosets modulo n partition the set [formula].

Let α be a primitive nth root of unity in some extension field of q. A set [formula] is called the defining set (relative to α) of a cyclic code C whenever c(x)∈C if and only if c(αi)  =  0 for all i∈T. In this paper, we assume implicitly that an nth root of unity has been fixed when talking of defining sets.

A ring element e such that e2 = e is called an idempotent. Since gcd(n,q) = 1, the ring Rn is semi-simple. Thus, by invoking the Wedderburn Structure theorems, we can say that each cyclic code in Rn contains a unique idempotent element which generates the ideal. Alternatively, this fact has also been proven directly in [\cite=fundamentals]. We call this idempotent element the generating idempotent (or idempotent generator) of the cyclic code.

Let a be an integer such that gcd(a,n) = 1. We define the function μa, called a multiplier, on [formula] by [formula]. Clearly, μa gives a permutation of the coordinate positions of a cyclic code of length n. Note that this is equivalent to the action of μa on Rn by [formula].

If C is a code of length n over q, we define a complement of C as a code Cc such that C + Cc  =  nq and [formula]. In general, a complement of a code is not unique. But it is easy to show that if C is cyclic, then Cc is unique and that it is also cyclic (see e.g., Exercise 243, [\cite=fundamentals]). In this case, we call Cc the cyclic complement of C.

Cyclic Codes over q2

We now consider cyclic codes over the Galois field q2, where q is a power of a prime p. In this case, we note that Rn  =  q2[x]  /  (xn - 1).

Idempotents in Rn

Consider the involution   :z  ↦  zq defined on q2. We extend this map component-wise to nq2. For an element [formula] in Rn, we set [formula].

Let C be a code of length n over q2. We define the conjugate of C to be the code [formula]. It can easily be shown that if C is a cyclic code with generating idempotent e(x), then [formula] is also cyclic and its generating idempotent is [formula].

Suppose we list all the distinct q2-cyclotomic cosets modulo n in the following way: such that

[formula]

By Corollary 4.3.15 of [\cite=fundamentals], an idempotent in Rn has the form

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

This gives [formula] by Theorem 4.3.13 of [\cite=fundamentals].

The discussion above is summarized in the following proposition.

Let C be a cyclic code over q2 with generating idempotent e(x). The following hold:

e(x) has the form given in ([\ref=star1]).

[formula] is cyclic with generating idempotent [formula].

[formula].

[formula].

Euclidean and Hermitian Duals

Let [formula] and [formula] be any vectors in nq2. Consider the involution :z  ↦  zq defined on q2. The Hermitian scalar product of [formula] and [formula] is given by [formula]. If C is a linear code over q2, the Euclidean dual of C is denoted [formula]. The Hermitian dual of C is [formula]. We say that a code C is Euclidean self-orthogonal if [formula], and that C is Euclidean self-dual if [formula]. Similarly, C is said to be Hermitian self-orthogonal if [formula], and that C is Hermitian self-dual if [formula].

Let [formula]. The reciprocal polynomial of f(x) is the polynomial [formula].

Let [formula], [formula] be vectors in nq2 with associated polynomials a(x) and b(x). Then [formula] is Hermitian orthogonal (similarly Euclidean orthogonal) to [formula] and all its cyclic shifts if and only if [formula] (similarly a(x)b*(x) = 0) in Rn.

Proof:   See Lemma 4.4.8 of [\cite=fundamentals] for the Euclidean case. The proof for the case of Hermitian orthogonality follows a similar argument and is omitted. [formula]   Recall that a vector [formula] of nq2 is called an even-like vector if [formula]. A code C is called an even-like code if all its codewords are even-like, otherwise it is called odd-like. The following lemma appears as Exercise 238 of [\cite=fundamentals] and its proof is left to the reader.

Let C be a cyclic code over q2 with defining set T and generator polynomial g(x). Let Ce be the subcode of C consisting of all the even-like vectors in C. Then:

Ce is cyclic and has defining set [formula].

C  =  Ce if and only if 0∈T if and only if g(1) = 0.

If C  ≠  Ce, then the generator polynomial of Ce is (x - 1)g(x).

The following propositions generalize some results on Euclidean duals of cyclic codes over an arbitrary finite field to Hermitian duals of cyclic codes over q2.

Let C be a cyclic code of length n over q2 with generating idempotent e(x) and defining set T. The following hold:

[formula] is a cyclic code and [formula].

[formula] has generating idempotent 1  -  e(x)μ- q.

If [formula], then [formula] mod n is the defining set for [formula].

Precisely one of C and [formula] is odd-like and the other is even-like.

Proof:   Let [formula]. Denote by [formula] the ith cyclic shift of [formula]. By assumption [formula] for all i. Let [formula]. For [formula], we have [formula]. Thus [formula] is cyclic. Note that [formula] and [formula] (Theorem 4.4.9 of [\cite=fundamentals]). It can easily be shown that [formula] and so using Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.3.16.1] we have [formula]. Hence [formula], proving part 1.

Using Theorem 4.4.6 and Theorem 4.3.13 of [\cite=fundamentals], the generating idempotent for [formula] is (1 - e(x))μ- q  =  1  -  e(x)μ- q. Thus part 2 holds.

The defining set for Cc is [formula] (Theorem 4.4.6 of [\cite=fundamentals]) and hence applying Corollary 4.4.5 of [\cite=fundamentals] the defining set for [formula] is [formula]. Since μ2- q  =  μ( - q)2  =  μq2 fixes each q2-cyclotomic coset and ( - q)- 1T is a union of q2-cyclotomic coset (using Theorem 4.4.2 of [\cite=fundamentals]), it follows that ( - q)- 1T  =  ( - q)2( - q)- 1T  =  ( - q)Tn. Thus the defining set for [formula] is [formula]. This proves part 3.

Lastly, since exactly one of T and [formula] contains 0, part 4 follows from part 3 and Lemma [\ref=exercise_238] . [formula]

The following lemma is from Exercise 239 of [\cite=fundamentals].

Let Ci be a cyclic code of length n over q2 with defining sets Ti for i = 1,2. Then:

[formula] has defining set [formula].

C1  +  C2 has defining set [formula].

[formula].

Let C be a Hermitian self-orthogonal cyclic code over q2 of length n with defining set T. Let [formula] be all the distinct q2-cyclotomic cosets modulo n partitioned such that Ci  =  Ciμ- q for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and Di  =  Eiμ- q for 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. Then the following hold:

Ci  ⊆  T1  ≤  i  ≤  k, and at least one of Di or Ei is contained in T for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  l.

C is even-like.

[formula].

Conversely, if C is a cyclic code with defining set T that satisfies part 1, then C is an Hermitian self-orthogonal code.

Proof:   Let [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], [formula] is the defining set for [formula]. By assumption, [formula] and so [formula] by Lemma [\ref=Exercise_239]. If [formula] for some i, then [formula]. Since Ci  =  Ciμ- q, it follows that [formula], a contradiction. Thus Ci  ⊆  T for all i. If [formula], then [formula]. Thus [formula]. Hence part 1 holds. To prove part 2, note that {0}  =  Ci for some i. Hence 0∈T by part 1. By Lemma [\ref=exercise_238], C is even-like. As noted in the proof of Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], ( - q)- 1T  =  ( - q)Tn. Using Corollary 4.4.5 of [\cite=fundamentals], Cμ- q has defining set ( - q)- 1T  =  ( - q)T. Since [formula], it follows that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=Exercise_239], [formula] is the defining set for [formula]. Thus [formula], which proves part 3. For the converse, assume T satisfies part 1. We will show that [formula] which will imply that C is Hermitian self-orthogonal. By Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], [formula]. Note that [formula]. Hence [formula] is a union of some Ei's and Di's. If [formula], then [formula], implying that [formula]. Since ( - q)Di = Ei, it follows that [formula]. By part 1, Di  ⊆  T. By a similar argument, it can be shown that if [formula], then Ei  ⊆  T. [formula]

Duadic Codes

Let n be an odd positive integer. We let [formula], the generating idempotent for the repetition code of length n over q.

We first define duadic codes over arbitrary finite fields. Then we proceed to examine duadic codes over finite fields of square order. The goal of this section is to present some results concerning Hermitian orthogonality of duadic codes over such finite fields.

Definitions and Basic Properties

Let e1(x) and e2(x) be a pair of even-like idempotents and let C1  =  〈e1(x)〉 and C2  =  〈e2(x)〉. The codes C1 and C2 form a pair of even-like duadic codes if the following properties are satisfied:

a) the idempotents satisfy [formula],

b) there is a multiplier μa such that C1μa  =  C2C2μa  =  C1.

To the pair of even-like codes C1 and C2, we associate a pair of odd-like duadic codes D1  =  〈1  -  e2(x)〉 and D2  =  〈1  -  e1(x)〉. We say that the multiplier μa gives a splitting for the even-like duadic codes or for the odd-like duadic codes.

([\cite=fundamentals].) Let C1 and C2 be cyclic codes over q with defining sets [formula] and [formula], respectively, where [formula] and [formula]. Then C1 and C2 form a pair of even-like duadic codes if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:

a) S1 and S2 satisfy [formula],

b) there is a multiplier μb such that S1μb  =  S2S2μb  =  S1 .

If the conditions in the preceding theorem are satisfied, we say that S1 and S2 gives a splitting of n by μb over q. This gives us another way of describing duadic codes. Note that for a fixed pair of duadic codes over q of length n, we can use the same multiplier for the splitting in Definition [\ref=duadicdef] and the splitting of n in Theorem [\ref=Thm_6.1.5].

([\cite=fundamentals].) Duadic codes of length n over q exist if and only if q is a square mod n.

Hermitian Orthogonality of Duadic Codes over q2

From this point onwards, we consider codes over the Galois field q2, where q is a power of some prime p. Again we assume that n is an odd positive integer and gcd(n,q) = 1. Thus duadic codes of length n over q2 always exist by Theorem [\ref=Thm_6.3.2]. The following theorem is the Hermitian analogue of Theorem 6.4.1 of [\cite=fundamentals], where the Euclidean self-orthogonality of duadic codes over q are considered.

Let C be any [formula] cyclic code of length n over q2. Then C is Hermitian self-orthogonal if and only if C is an even-like duadic code whose splitting is given by μ- q.

Proof:   (⇐) Suppose C  =  C1 is an even-like duadic code whose splitting is given by μ- q. Let e(x) be the generating idempotent for C. By Theorem 6.1.3 (vi) of [\cite=fundamentals], C  =  C1  ⊆  D1  =  〈1  -  e(x)μ- q〉. By Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], the generating idempotent for [formula] is also 1 - e(x)μ- q. Thus [formula] and so C is Hermitian self-orthogonal. (  ⇒  ) Let C  =  C1 be a Hermitian self-orthogonal cyclic code. Let e1(x) be the generating idempotent for C1 and T1 its defining set. Since C1 is Hermitian self-orthogonal and [formula] is not orthogonal to itself, [formula]. Hence by Lemma 6.1.2 (iii) of [\cite=fundamentals], C1 is even-like. Let e2(x)  =  e1(x)μ- q and let C2  =  〈e2(x)〉. By Theorem 4.3.13 of [\cite=fundamentals], C2  =  C1μ- q. Let [formula]. Since C1 is even-like, it follows that [formula]. Thus [formula] which implies that [formula]. Since [formula] has dimension [formula] and [formula], we have [formula]. Using Theorem 4.3.7 of [\cite=fundamentals] and Lemma 6.1.2 (i) of [\cite=fundamentals], [formula] has generating idempotent [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], the generating idempotent for [formula] is 1  -  e1(x)μ- q. By the uniqueness of the idempotent generator, we must have [formula] which implies [formula]. Clearly e1(x)  =  e2(x)(μ- q)- 1  =  e2(x)(μ- q). Therefore C1 and C2 form a pair of even-like codes whose splitting is given by μ- q. [formula]

Let C be a cyclic code. Then [formula].

Proof:   Use Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1] above and Theorem 4.3.13 of [\cite=fundamentals] to show that [formula] and [formula] have the same idempotent generator. [formula]

Suppose that C1 and C2 are a pair of even-like duadic codes over q2, having D1 and D2 as their associated odd-like duadic codes. Then the following are equivalent.

[formula]

[formula]

C1μ- q  =  C2

C2μ- q  =  C1

Proof:   From the definition of duadic codes and Theorem 6.1.3 (vii) of [\cite=fundamentals], we obtain C1μa  =  C2, C2μa  =  C1, D1μa  =  D2 and D2μa  =  D1 for some a. Hence by Lemma [\ref=LEMMA], if part 1 holds, then and if part 2 holds, then Hence parts 1 and 2 are equivalent.

Part 3 is equivalent to part 4 since (μ- q)- 1  =  μ- q.

If part 1 holds, then by Theorem 6.1.3 (vi) of [\cite=fundamentals], C1 is Hermitian self-orthogonal. Hence by Proposition [\ref=Thm_6.4.1.1], part 3 holds.

If part 3 holds, then μ- q gives a splitting for C1 and C2. Let ei(x) be the generating idempotent for Ci. By Theorem 4.3.13 of [\cite=fundamentals], e1(x)μ- q  =  e2(x). Hence by Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], the generating idempotent for [formula] is 1  -  e1(x)μ- q  =  1  -  e2(x). Thus, part 1 holds, completing the proof. [formula]

Suppose that C1 and C2 are a pair of even-like duadic codes over q2, having D1 and D2 as their associated odd-like duadic codes. Then the following are equivalent.

[formula]

[formula]

C1μ- q  =  C1

C2μ- q  =  C2

Proof:   From the definition of duadic codes and Theorem 6.1.3 (vii) of [\cite=fundamentals], we obtain C1μa  =  C2, C2μa  =  C1, D1μa  =  D2 and D2μa  =  D1 for some a. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=LEMMA], if part 1 holds, then and if part 2 holds, then Hence parts 1 and 2 are equivalent.

Let ei(x) be the generating idempotent for Ci. By Proposition [\ref=Thm_4.4.9.1], [formula] has generating idempotent 1  -  e1(x)μ- q. Thus [formula] if and only if 1  -  e1(x)μ- q  =  1  -  e1(x) if and only if e1(x)μ- q  =  e1(x) if and only if C1μ- q  =  C1 by Theorem 4.3.13 of [\cite=fundamentals]. Hence parts 1 and 3 are equivalent. It can be shown by an analogous argument that parts 2 and 4 are equivalent. [formula]

Extensions of Odd-like Duadic Codes

Odd-like duadic codes have parameters [formula]. Hence it is interesting to consider extending such codes because such extensions could possibly be Hermitian self-dual codes. The goal of this section is to give a way of extending odd-like duadic codes and to give conditions under which these extensions are Hermitian self-dual. We also prove that any cyclic code whose extended code is Hermitian self-dual must be an odd-like duadic code.

Let D be an odd-like duadic code. The code D can be obtained from its even-like subcode C by adding [formula] to a basis of C (Theorem 6.1.3 (ix), [\cite=fundamentals] ). Hence it is natural to define an extension for which the all-one vector [formula] is Hermitian orthogonal to itself.

In q2 consider the equation

[formula]

Since q is a power of a prime p and n∈p  ⊆  q, we have nq  =  n, or nq + 1  =  n2 in q2. So [formula]. Thus Equation ([\ref=gamma1]) is equivalent to

[formula]

Note that {aq + 1|a∈q2}  =  q. Thus ([\ref=gamma2]) will always have a solution in q2, which implies that ([\ref=gamma1]) is solvable in q2.

We are now ready to describe the extension. Let γ be a solution to ([\ref=gamma1]). Let [formula]. Define the extended codeword [formula], where Let [formula] be the extended code of D.

Let D1 and D2 be a pair of odd-like duadic codes of length n over q2. The following hold:

If μ- q gives the splitting for D1 and D2, then [formula] and [formula] are Hermitian self-dual.

If D1μ- q  =  D1, then [formula] and [formula] are Hermitian duals of each other.

Proof:   Let C1 and C2 be the even-like duadic codes associated to D1 and D2.

Note that

[formula]

by our choice of γ. This shows that [formula] is Hermitian orthogonal to itself. Since Ci is even-like, [formula] is obtained by adding a zero coordinate to Ci and so [formula] is also orthogonal to [formula].

We first prove part 1. Proposition [\ref=Thm_6.4.1.1] ensures that C1 is Hermitian self-orthogonal, and so [formula] is Hermitian self-orthogonal. Since [formula] is orthogonal to [formula], the code spanned by [formula] is Hermitian self-orthogonal. However, by Theorem 6.1.3 (ix) of [\cite=fundamentals], [formula]. Clearly [formula]. Thus [formula] is Hermitian self-orthogonal. Since the dimension of [formula] is [formula], [formula] is Hermitian self dual. Analogous arguments will prove that [formula] is Hermitian self-dual. We now prove part 2. Suppose D1μ- q  =  D1. It follows that C1μ- q = C1. By Proposition [\ref=Thm_6.4.3.1], [formula] and so by Theorem 6.1.3 (vi) of [\cite=fundamentals], [formula]. Therefore [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal to each other and consequently the codes spanned by [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal. By Theorem 6.1.3 (v) & (vi) of [\cite=fundamentals], these codes must be [formula] and [formula] of dimension [formula]. Therefore [formula] and [formula] are duals of each other. [formula]

Let C be a cyclic code over q2. The extended code [formula] is Hermitian self-dual if and only if C is an odd-like duadic code whose splitting is given by μ- q.

Proof:

(⇐) This follows directly from the preceding proposition.

(  ⇒  ) Since the extended code [formula] has length n + 1, the dimension of C is [formula] and therefore C cannot be Hermitian self-orthogonal. The assumption that [formula] is self-dual implies that the even-like subcode of C is necessarily Hermitian self-orthogonal. Since C is not Hermitian self-orthogonal, C cannot be even-like. Let Ce be the even-like subcode of C. The code Ce is an

[formula]

Lengths with Splittings By μ- q

All throughout this section, we let q be a power of a prime p and we assume that n is an odd integer with gcd(n,q)  =  1. Define ordr(q) to be the smallest positive integer t such that [formula]. In view of Proposition [\ref=Thm_6.4.1.1] and Corollary [\ref=Cor_6.4.14.1], it is natural to ask under what conditions do we get a splitting of n by μ- q. We note that the study of the feasibility of an integer in [\cite=SD_over_GF4] becomes a special case of this with q = 2. The main result of this section is the following theorem.

The permutation map μ- q gives a splitting of n if and only if [formula] for every prime r dividing n.

Our proof of this theorem will be based on several lemmas. Lemma [\ref=prop_3] is a well-known fact from elementary number theory, see e.g. Proposition 3 in [\cite=moree], and we leave its proof as an exercise to the reader.

Let r be a prime distinct from p. Then r divides qk  +  1 for some positive integer k if and only if ordr(q) is even.

Let r be a prime distinct from p. Then r divides q2i - 1 + 1 for some integer i  ≥  1 if and only if [formula].

Proof:   By Lemma [\ref=prop_3], r divides qk + 1 for some positive integer k if and only if ordr(q) is even. If ordr(q) is even, then Thus r divides q2i - 1 + 1 if and only if ordr(q) is even and

[formula]

But ([\ref=sol]) has a solution i if and only if [formula]. [formula]

Assume gcd(n,q) = 1. Then gcd(n,q2i - 1 + 1)  =  1 for every integer i  ≥  1 if and only if [formula] for every prime r dividing n.

Proof:   Write [formula]. Then, using Lemma [\ref=Lem_a], [formula] if and only if for all [formula] if and only if for all [formula] if and only if gcd(n,q2i - 1 + 1)  =  1i  ≥  1.

Let t be an integer such that [formula] and [formula] for some non-negative integer j. Suppose gcd(t,n) = 1. Then μt gives a splitting of n if and only if gcd(n,q2i - t)  =  1 for every integer i  ≥  1.

Proof:   Clearly by the assumptions on t, (μt)2(Cs)  =  Cs for every q2-cyclotomic coset Cs. Thus μt gives a splitting of n if and only if it does not fix any q2-cyclotomic coset. Let Ca be a q2-cyclotomic coset. Then μt fixes Ca if and only if [formula] for some positive integer i. Thus μt gives a splitting of n if and only if [formula] for every i  ≥  1 if and only if gcd(n,q2i - t)  =  1i  ≥  1. [formula]

Theorem 9 of [\cite=qcodes] is a special case of Proposition [\ref=Prop_2] with q = 2.

The permutation map μ- q gives a splitting of n if and only if gcd(n,q2i - 1 + 1)  =  1 for every integer i  ≥  1.

Proof:   This follows immediately from Proposition [\ref=Prop_2] since gcd(n,q)  =  1 by assumption. [formula]

We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section. Proof of Theorem [\ref=splitting]:

By Corollary [\ref=Cor_2], the permutation map μ- q gives a splitting of n if and only if gcd(n,q2i - 1 + 1)  =  1 for every integer i  ≥  1. By Proposition [\ref=Prop_1], gcd(n,q2i - 1 + 1)  =  1 for every integer i  ≥  1 if and only if [formula] for every prime r dividing n. [formula]

We remark that Theorem [\ref=splitting] says that μ- q gives a splitting of n if and only if for all prime r dividing n, either ordr(q) is odd or ordr(q) is doubly even. However, it is easy to show that ordr(q) is doubly even if and only if ordr(q2) is even. Thus we can restate Theorem [\ref=splitting] as:

The permutation map μ- q gives a splitting of n if and only if for every prime r dividing n, either ordr(q) is odd or ordr(q2) is even.

Lastly, we arrive at the following result which gives sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of Hermitian self-dual extended cyclic code. We note that the same result was obtained in [\cite=conchita] for the more general case of group codes.

Cyclic codes of length n over q2 whose extended code is Hermitian self-dual exist if and only if for every prime r dividing n, either ordr(q) is odd or ordr(q2) is even.

Proof:   This follows directly from Corollary [\ref=Cor_6.4.14.1] and Theorem [\ref=Thm_3.17]. [formula]

The table below enumerates all the splittings (up to symmetry between S1 and S2) of n by μ- q over q2 for 5  ≤  n  ≤  45 and q = 3, q = 4 and q = 5 by listing all the possible sets for the S1 in Theorem [\ref=Thm_6.1.5]. The Ci's are q2-cyclotomic cosets modulo n. We omit those n for which no such splitting exists for all values of q.

Quantitative Aspects

Counting integers that are split by μ- q

Theorem [\ref=splitting] raises the question of counting the number of integers n  ≤  x such that μ- q gives a splitting of n. In other words, we are interested in counting those integers n such that n is coprime with the sequence S(q): = {q2i - 1 + 1}∞i = 1. We let Aq(x) denote the associated counting function. We are interested in sharp estimates for Aq(x) as x gets large. We use the shorthand GRH to denote the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. The best we can do in this respect is stated in the following theorem:

Let q = pt be a prime power. Put λ  =  ν2(t).

For some positive constant cq we have where the implicit constant depends at most on q.

Let ε > 0 and v  ≥  1 be arbitrary. Assuming GRH we have that where the implied constant depends at most on ε and q, and [formula] are constants that depend at most on q.

The constant δ(q) is the natural density of primes r such that ord[formula] and is given as follows:

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=main] rests on various lemmas. Let χq(n) be the characteristic function of the integers n that are coprime with the sequence S(q), i.e. Clearly [formula]. Note that χq(n) is a completely multiplicative function in n, i.e., χq(nm) = χq(n)χq(m) for all natural numbers n and m. This observation reduces the study of χq(n) to that of χq(r) with r a prime. Using Lemma [\ref=Lem_a] we infer the following lemma.

We have χq(r) = 1 if and only if r = p or ord[formula] in case r  ≠  p.

This result allows one to count the number of primes r  ≤  x such that (r,S(q)) = 1. Recall that Li(x), the logarithmic integral, is defined as [formula].

Write q = pt. Let λ  =  ν2(t).

We have

[formula]

Assuming GRH the estimate ([\ref=noname]) holds with error term [formula], where the index q indicates that the implied constant depends at most on q.

Proof:   1.) The number of primes r  ≤  x such that ord[formula] is counted in Theorem 2 of [\cite=moree]. On invoking the Prime Number Theorem in the form π(x) = Li(x) + O(x log - 3x), the proof of part 1 is then completed.

2.) The proof of this part follows from Theorem 3 of [\cite=Moree2] together with the well-known result (von Koch, 1901) that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent with [formula]. [formula]

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=main].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]: 1.) This is a consequence of part 1 of Lemma [\ref=lemma3], Theorem 4 of [\cite=moree] and the fact that χq(n) is multiplicative in n.

2.) By part 2 of Lemma [\ref=lemma3] we have [formula]. Now invoke Theorem 6 of [\cite=MC] with f(n) = χq(n). [formula]

Counting duadic codes

Theorem [\ref=Thm_6.3.2] allows one to study how many duadic codes of length n  ≤  x (with (n,q) = 1) over q exist as x gets large. We let Dq(x) be the associated counting function. Indeed, we will study the more general function Da(x) which is defined similarly, but where a is an arbitrary integer. The trivial case arises when a is a square and thus we assume henceforth that a is not a square.

At first glance it seems that with (a / n) the Jacobi symbol. However, it is not true that (a / n) = 1 if and only if a is a square modulo n, e.g., (2 / 15) = (2 / 3)(2 / 5) = ( - 1)( - 1) = 1, but 2 is not a square modulo 15. It is possible, however, to develop a criterium for a to be a square modulo n in terms of Legendre symbols. To this effect first note that if a is a square modulo n, then a must be a square modulo all prime powers in the factorisation of n. This is a consequence of the following lemma.

Let n and m be coprime integers. Then a is a square modulo mn if and only if it is a square modulo m and a square modulo n.

Proof:   By the Chinese Remainder Theorem [formula] is an isomorphism of rings and hence a is a square in the ring on the left if and only if a is is square in the ring on the right. Now note that the multiplication in the second ring is coordinatewise. [formula]

It is a well-known result from elementary number theory that if p is an odd prime and if [formula] is solvable, so is [formula] for all e  ≥  1, see e.g. [\cite=IR]. Using this observation together with Lemma [\ref=dima] one arrives at the following criterium for a to be a square modulo n.

Let a and n be coprime integers. Put Let e = ν2(n). Put Then

By Lemma [\ref=karakteristiek] we have that [formula]. Note that ga(n) is a multiplicative function, but that fa(n) is a multiplicative function only on the odd integers n (generically). For this reason let us first consider As a consequence of the law of quadratic reciprocity, the primes p for which ga(p) = 1 are precisely the primes p in certain arithmetic progressions with modulus dividing 4q. On using the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions one then infers that for every v > 0 the following estimate holds true:

[formula]

On using this one sees that the conditions of Theorem 6 of [\cite=MC] are satisfied and this yields the truth of the following assertion.

Let ε > 0 and v  ≥  1 be arbitrary. Suppose that a is not a square. We have where the implied constant depends at most on ε and a, and [formula] are constants that depend at most on a.

Now it is straightforward to derive an asymptotic for Da(x). Using Lemma [\ref=karakteristiek] one infers that

[formula]

From this and Lemma [\ref=hulp] it then follows that we have the following asymptotic for Da(x).

Let ε > 0 and v  ≥  1 be arbitrary. Suppose that a is not a square. We have where the implied constant depends at most on ε and a, and [formula] are constants that depend at most on a.

In particular we have, as x tends to infinity, where Da and Ga are positive constants. We now consider the explicit evaluation of these constants. Note that by ([\ref=splittje]) it suffices to find an explicit formula for the constant Ga.

In case a = D is a negative discriminant of a binary quadratic form this constant can be easily computed using results from the analytic theory of binary quadratic forms. We say an integer D is a discriminant if it arises as the discriminant of a binary quadratic form. This implies that either 4|D or [formula]. On the other hand, it can be shown that any number D satisfying 4|D or [formula] arises as the discriminant of a binary quadratic form. Now let D be a discriminant and ξD be the multiplicative function defined as follows: Let n be any integer coprime to D. Then ξD(n) = 1 if and only if n is represented by some primitive positive integral binary quadratic form of discriminant D. Let BD(x) denote the number of positive integers n  ≤  x which are coprime to D and which are represented by some primitive integral form of discriminant D  ≤   - 3. Note that [formula]. It was proved by James [\cite=J] that where J(D) is the positive constant given by

[formula]

and p runs over all primes such that (D / p) =  - 1. (Recall that the Dirichlet L-series L(s,χD) is defined by [formula].) Since the behaviour of ξD is so similar to that of fD, James' result can in fact be used to determine the asymptotic behaviour of GD(x) for negative discriminants D and, in particular, to determine GD. Using a classical result of Wirsing, see e.g. Theorem 3 of [\cite=MC], one infers that From this and the identity ([\ref=jd]) it follows that GD is the positive solution of

[formula]

For more details on BD(x) and related counting functions the reader is referred to a paper (in preparation) by Moree and Osburn [\cite=MO]. In [\cite=MO] it is also pointed out that BD(x) in fact satisfies an asymptotic result similar to the one given for Da(x) in Theorem [\ref=ana].

The fact that the characteristic functions ξd and fD are so closely connected, can be exploited to give a criterium for the existence of duadic codes in terms of representability by quadratic forms.

Let q be an odd prime power, say q = pe1 with [formula]. Let n be an odd squarefree integer satisfying (n,q) = 1 and suppose, moreover, that n can be written as a sum of two integer squares. A duadic code of length n over q exists if and only if n can be represented by some primitive positive integral binary quadratic form of discriminant - p1

Proof:   By assumption [formula] and hence is a discriminant. The assumption that n is odd and squarefree ensures that ξ- p1(n) = f- p1(n) = f- pe1(n). The assumption that n can be represented as a sum of two squares, together with the assumption that n is squarefree ensures that n is a product of primes p satisfying [formula]. For every prime [formula] we have ( - pe1 / p) = (pe1 / p). It thus follows that ξ- p1(n) = f- pe1(n) = fpe1(n). The result then follows on invoking Theorem [\ref=Thm_6.3.2], Lemma [\ref=karakteristiek] and the fact that, for (n,D) = 1, ξD(n) = 1 if and only if n is represented by some primitive positive integral binary quadratic form of discriminant D. [formula]

It remains, however, to determine Ga for a general number a. It is well-known from Tauberian theory that one has where [formula]. An easy computation shows that On using that the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s) has a simple pole at s = 1 of residue 1, one obtains that Notice that equation ([\ref=deetje]) is a special case of this.
