Introduction.

Let Σ be a finite subset in [formula] and [formula], where [formula]. The points of the set Σ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree ξ if and only if for every point P∈Σ there is a homogeneous form of degree ξ that vanishes at [formula] and does not vanish at P, which is equivalent to [formula], where IΣ is the ideal sheaf of Σ.

In this paper we prove the following result (see Section [\ref=section:main]).

Suppose that at most λk points of the set Σ lie on a curve of degree k, where [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] if one of the following conditions holds:

ξ  =  ⌊3λ / 2 - 3⌋ and |Σ| < λ⌈λ / 2⌉;

ξ  =  ⌊3μ - 3⌋ and [formula], where [formula] such that [formula];

ξ  =  ⌊nμ⌋ and [formula], where [formula] such that [formula].

Let us consider applications of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

An algebraic variety is called factorial if its divisor class group is [formula].

Let [formula] be a double cover branched over a surface S of degree [formula] such that the only singularities of S are isolated ordinary double points. Then X is a hypersurface

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and f2r is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2r such that f2r = 0 defines the surface [formula].

It follows from [\cite=Ha70] and [\cite=Di90] that the following conditions are equivalent:

the threefold X is factorial;

the singularities of the threefold X are [formula]-factorial;

the equality [formula] holds;

the ring [formula] is a UFD, where I =  < w2 - f2r(x,y,z,t) > ;

the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 4.

In the case r = 3, the threefold X is known to be non-rational if it is factorial (see [\cite=ChPa04]), but the threefold X is rational if the surface S is the Barth sextic (see [\cite=Ba96]).

Suppose that [formula]. Then X is factorial.

The subset [formula] is a set-theoretic intersection of surfaces of degree 2r - 1, which implies that X is factorial by Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

The claim of Theorem [\ref=theorem:double-solid] is conjectured in [\cite=Ch04t], and it is proved in [\cite=ChPa04] in the case r = 3.

Suppose that the surface S is given by an equation

[formula]

where gi is a general homogeneous polynomial of degree i. Then X is not factorial, singular points of the surface S are isolated ordinary double points, and [formula].

We prove the following result in Section [\ref=section:extra].

Suppose that [formula]. Then the threefold X is not factorial if and only if the surface [formula] can be defined by the equation [\ref=equation:nodal-surface].

Let V be a hypersurface in [formula] of degree d such that V has at most isolated ordinary double points. Then V can be given by the equation

[formula]

where fn is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n. It follows from [\cite=Ha70] and [\cite=Di90] that the hypersurface V is factorial if and only is one of the following conditions holds:

the hypersurface V has [formula]-factorial singularities;

the equality [formula] holds;

the ring [formula] is a UFD, where I =  < fn(x,y,z,u) > ;

the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 2d - 5.

In the case d = 4, the hypersurface V is not rational if it is factorial (see [\cite=Me03]), but a general determinantal quartic threefold is rational and has isolated ordinary double points.

Suppose that [formula]. Then V is factorial.

The claim of Conjecture [\ref=conjecture:factoriality] is proved in [\cite=Ch04e] and [\cite=ChPa05d] in the case when [formula].

Suppose that the hypersurface V is given by the equation

[formula]

where g and f are general homogeneous polynomials of degree d - 1. Then V is not factorial, singular points of V are isolated ordinary double points, and [formula].

The factoriality of V is proved in [\cite=Ch04t] in the case when [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Then V is factorial.

The set [formula] is a set-theoretic intersection of hypersurfaces of degree d - 1, which implies the claim for [formula] by Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. In the case [formula], the factoriality of the hypersurface V follows from Theorem 2 in [\cite=EiJ87] .

Let Y be a complete intersection of hypersurfaces F and G in [formula] of degree m and k, respectively, such that [formula] and Y has at most isolated ordinary double points.

Let F and G be general hypersurfaces that contain a two-dimensional linear subspace in [formula]. Then F and G are smooth, the threefold Y has isolated ordinary double points, and [formula], but Y is not factorial.

It follows from [\cite=Di90] that the threefold Y is factorial if its singular points impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 2m + k - 6.

Suppose that G is smooth, and Y has at most (m + k - 2)(2m + k - 6) / 5 ordinary double points. Then the complete intersection Y is factorial for [formula].

The set [formula] is a set-theoretic intersection of hypersurfaces of degree m + k - 2, which concludes the proof by Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

Arguing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:complete-intersection-I], we obtain the following result.

Suppose that G is smooth, and Y has at most (2m + k - 3)(m + k - 2) / 3 ordinary double points. Then the complete intersection Y is factorial for [formula].

Let H be a smooth hypersurface in [formula] of degree d, and η:U  →  H be a double cover ramified in a surface R  ⊂  H that is cut out by a hypersurface of degree [formula] that has isolated ordinary double points. Then U is factorial if the points of [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r + d - 5 (see [\cite=Di90]).

The threefold U is factorial if [formula] and [formula].

The set [formula] is a set-theoretic intersection of hypersurfaces of degree 2r + d - 2, which implies the claim by Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

Main result.

Let Σ be a finite subset in [formula], where [formula]. In this section we prove the following special case of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] leaving other cases to the reader, because their proofs are similar.

Suppose that at most (2r - 1)k points of the set Σ lie on a curve of degree k, and |Σ| < (2r - 1)r, where [formula] and [formula]. Then the points of the set Σ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 4.

We may assume that [formula] due to the following result, which is Corollary 4.3 in [\cite=DaGe88].

Let [formula] be a blow up of points [formula], and Ei be the π-exceptional divisor such that π(Ei) = Pi. Then the linear system [formula] does not have base points if at most k(ξ + 3 - k) - 2 points of the set [formula] lie on a curve of degree k for every natural number [formula], and the inequality

[formula]

holds, where ξ is a natural number such that [formula].

Hence, to prove Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4], we may assume that n = 3 due to the following result.

Let Π be an m-dimensional linear subspace in [formula] such that [formula], and

[formula]

be a projection from a general (n - m - 1)-dimensional linear subspace [formula] such that there is a subset Λ  ⊂  Σ such that [formula], but the set ψ(Λ) is contained in an irreducible curve of degree k, and M be the linear system of hypersurfaces in [formula] of degree k that contain Λ. Then the base locus of M is zero-dimensional, and either m = 2, or k > λ.

Suppose that the base locus of M contains an irreducible curve Z. Let Ξ be a subset of the set Λ consisting of points that are contained in the curve Z. Then we may assume that ψ(Z) does not contain any point of the set [formula], and ψ|Z is a birational morphism, because ψ is a general projection. Thus, we have [formula].

Let C be an irreducible curve in Π of degree k that contains ψ(Λ), and W be the cone in [formula] over the curve C and with vertex Ω. Then W∈M, which implies that W contains the curve Z. Thus, we have ψ(Z) = C, which implies that Ξ  =  Λ and [formula], but the curve Z contains at most λk points of the set Σ. Hence, the the base locus of the linear system M is zero-dimensional.

Suppose that m > 2 and [formula]. Let us show that the latter assumption leads to a contradiction. We may assume that m = 3 and n = 4, because we may consider ψ as a composition of n - m projections from points. Thus, the projection [formula] is a projection from the point [formula].

Let Y be the set of all irreducible reduced surfaces in [formula] of degree k that contains all points of the set Λ, and Υ be a subset of [formula] consisting of points that are contained in every surface of Y. Then Λ  ⊆  Υ, but the previous arguments imply that Υ is a finite set.

Let S be the set of all surfaces in [formula] of degree k such that S∈S if and only if there is a surface Y∈Y such that ψ(Y) = S and ψ|Y is a birational morphism. Then S is not empty, because the projection ψ is general enough and the construction of the set Y does not depend on the choice of the projection ψ. Let Ψ be a subset of [formula] consisting of points that are contained in every surface of the set S. Then ψ(Λ)  ⊆  ψ(Υ)  ⊆  Ψ by construction.

The generality of Ω implies that ψ(Υ) = Ψ. Indeed, for every point [formula] and any general surface Y∈Y, we may assume that the line passing through O and Ω does not intersect Y, but the restriction ψ|Y is a birational morphism.

Thus, the set Ψ is a set-theoretic intersection of surfaces in Π of degree k, which implies that at most δk points in Ψ lie on a curve in Π of degree δ. Hence, at most k2 points of the set Ψ lie on a curve in Π of degree k, but ψ(Λ) contains at least λk + 1 points contained in an irreducible curve in Π of degree k, which is a contradiction.

Thus, we have a finite subset [formula] such that |Σ| < (2r - 1)r, and at most (2r - 1)k points of Σ lie on a curve of degree k, where [formula] and [formula]. Fix an integer ε such that

[formula]

and [formula]. We prove the following result, which implies Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4].

The points of the set Σ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 4 - ε.

Fix an arbitrary point P of the set Σ. To prove Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon] it is enough to construct a surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 - ε that contains [formula] and does not contain P.

We may assume that [formula] and [formula], because the claim of Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon] follows from Theorem 2 in [\cite=EiJ87] and Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese] in the case when [formula] or [formula].

Suppose that Σ  ⊂  Π, where Π is a hyperplane in [formula]. Then there is a surface of degree 3r - 4 - ε in [formula] that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P.

Suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. We have r = 4 and ε = 0, which implies that

[formula]

Thus, we proved that in every possible case the inequality

[formula]

holds, but at most 3r - 4 - ε points of [formula] can lie on a line, because [formula].

Let us prove that at most k(3r - 1 - ε - k) - 2 points of the set [formula] can lie on a curve of degree [formula]. It is enough to show that

[formula]

for all [formula]. We must prove the latter inequality only for k > 1 such that

[formula]

because otherwise the condition that at most k(3r - 1 - k) - 2 points of [formula] can lie on a curve of degree k is vacuous. In particular, we may assume that k < r - ε, but

[formula]

which implies that at most k(3r - 1 - ε - k) - 2 points of [formula] lie on a curve of degree k.

It follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese] that there is a curve C  ⊂  Π of degree 3r - 4 - ε that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P. Let Y be a sufficiently general cone in [formula] over the curve C. Then Y is the required surface.

Fix a sufficiently general hyperplane [formula]. Let [formula] be a projection from a sufficiently general point [formula]. Put [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that at most (2r - 1)k points of the set [formula] lie on a possibly reducible curve in Π of degree k. Then there is a surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 - ε that contains all points of the set [formula] but does not contain the point P.

Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:surfaces-I] we obtain a curve C  ⊂  Π of degree 3r - 4 - ε that contains [formula] and does not pass through [formula]. Let Y be the cone in [formula] over the curve C with the vertex O. Then Y is the required surface.

To conclude the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4] we may assume that at least (2r - 1)k + 1 points of [formula] lie on a curve of degree k, where k is the smallest number of such property.

The inequality [formula] holds.

Let Φ  ⊆  Σ be a subset such that |Φ| > 2(2r - 1), but the set ψ(Φ) is contained in a conic C  ⊂  Π. Then the conic C is irreducible. Let D be a linear system of quadric surfaces in [formula] containing Φ. Then the base locus of D is zero-dimensional by Lemma [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional].

The inequality [formula] holds by Lemma [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional], which implies [formula].

Let W be a cone in [formula] over C with the vertex Ω. Then

[formula]

where D1 and D2 are general divisors in D, which is a contradiction.

There is a subset Λ1k  ⊆  Σ such that |Λ1k| > (2r - 1)k, but ψ(Λ1k) is contained in an irreducible curve of degree k. Similarly, we get a disjoint union [formula], where Λij is a subset in Σ such that |Λij| > (2r - 1)j, the points of the subset ψ(Λij) lie on an irreducible reduced curve in Π of degree j, and at most (2r - 1)ζ points of the subset

[formula]

lie on a curve in Π of degree ζ. Put [formula]. Let Ξij be the base locus of the linear system of surfaces of degree j that contains Λij. Then Ξij is a finite set by Lemma [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and

[formula]

The inequality [formula] holds.

We have Λij  ⊆  Ξij by construction, but the points of the set Ξij impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3(j - 1) by the following result.

Let M be a linear subsystem in [formula] such that the base locus of the linear system M is zero-dimensional. Then the points of the base locus of M impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree n(λ - 1).

See Lemma 22 in [\cite=Ch04t] or Theorem 3 in [\cite=DaGeOr85].

Put [formula]. Then Λ  ⊆  Ξ.

Suppose that Σ  ⊆  Ξ. Then there is a surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 - ε that contains all points of the set [formula] and does not contain the point P∈Σ.

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing] that for every set Ξij containing the point P there is a surface in [formula] of degree 3(j - 1) that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P. For every set Ξij not containing the point P there is a surface of degree j that contains the set Ξij and does not contain P by the definition of the set Ξij.

The inequality j < 3(j - 1) holds, because [formula]. Therefore, for every [formula] there is a surface [formula] of degree 3(j - 1) that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P. The union [formula] is a surface of degree

[formula]

that contains all points of the set [formula] and does not contain the point P.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:surfaces-III] implies that there is surface of degree [formula] that contains [formula] and does not contain P, and there is a surface of degree [formula] that contains [formula] and does not contain any point of the set [formula].

Let Λ and Δ be disjoint finite subsets in [formula] such that there is a hypersurface of degree [formula] that contains Λ and does not contain any point in Δ, the points of Λ impose independent linear conditions on hypersurfaces of degree ξ, the points of Δ impose independent linear conditions on hypersurfaces of degree ξ  -  ζ. Then the points of [formula] impose independent linear conditions on hypersurfaces of degree ξ.

Let Q be a point in [formula]. To conclude the proof we must find a hypersurface of degree ξ that contains [formula] and does not contain Q. We may assume that Q∈Λ.

Let F be the homogenous form of degree ξ that vanishes at [formula] and does not vanish at Q. Put [formula], where Qi is a point. Then there is a homogeneous form Gi of degree ξ that vanishes at [formula] and does not vanish at Qi. We have

[formula]

for some [formula], because gi(Qi)  ≠  0. Then the homogenous form [formula] vanishes at every point of the set [formula] and does not vanish at the point Q.

Put [formula] and [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping] that to prove Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon] it is enough to show that the points of the subset   ⊂  Π and the integer d satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese]. We may assume that [formula].

The inequality [formula] holds.

Suppose that the inequality [formula] holds. Then

[formula]

by Corollary [\ref=corollary:from-the-number-of-good-points]. Put [formula]. Then [formula] and

[formula]

which implies that [formula], which is a contradiction.

The inequality [formula] holds by Corollary [\ref=corollary:from-the-number-of-good-points], because [formula].

Suppose that at least d + 1 points of the set [formula] lie on a line. Then there is a surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 - ε containing [formula] and not passing through the point P.

We have [formula]. Hence, it follows from the inequalities [\ref=equation:number-of-good-points] that

[formula]

which gives [formula]. Now it follows from Corollary [\ref=corollary:from-the-number-of-good-points] that [formula], but [formula], which implies that [formula] and d = 2r - 2.

We have a surface of degree [formula] that contains [formula] and does not contain the point P, and we have a surface of degree r - ε - 2 that contains all points of the set [formula] and does not contain any point of the set [formula].

The set [formula] contains at most 4r - 4 points, but at most 2r - 1 points of Σ lie on a line. The points of [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 2r - 2 by Theorem 2 in [\cite=EiJ87], which concludes the proof by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].

Therefore, we may assume that at most d points of the set [formula] lie on a line in Π.

At most t(d + 3 - t) - 2 points of [formula] lie on a curve in Π of degree [formula].

At most (2r - 1)t of the points of [formula] lie on a curve in Π of degree t, which implies that to conclude the proof it is enough to show that the inequality

[formula]

holds for every [formula] such that t > 1 and t(d + 3 - t) - 2 < ||. We have

[formula]

because t > 1. Therefore, we may assume that the inequalities t(d + 3 - t) - 2 < || and

[formula]

hold. Let g(x) = x(d + 3 - x) - 2. Then g(x) is increasing for every x < (d + 3) / 2, which implies that [formula]. Now the inequalities [\ref=equation:number-of-good-points] imply that

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

We can apply Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese] to the blow up of Π at the points of [formula] and the integer d, which implies the existence of a surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 - ε that contains every point of the set [formula] and does not contain the point P by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].

Auxiliary result.

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:Hong-and-Park]. Let [formula] be a double cover branched over a surface S of degree [formula] with isolated ordinary double points.

Let F be a hypersurface in [formula] of degree d such that F has isolated singularities, and C be a curve in [formula] of degree k. Then C contains at most k(d - 1) singular points of the hypersurface F, and the equality [formula] implies that every singular point of the hypersurface F contained in C is non-singular on the curve C.

Let [formula] be the homogeneous form of degree d such that [formula] defines the hypersurface F, where [formula] are homogeneous coordinates on [formula]. Put

[formula]

where [formula]. Then the base locus of the linear system D consists of singular points of the hypersurface F. Therefore, the curve C intersects a generic member of the linear system D at most (d - 1)k times, which implies the claim.

Suppose that there are plane [formula] and a reduced curve C  ⊂  Π of degree r that contains (2r - 1)r singular points of S. Then S can be defined by the equation [\ref=equation:nodal-surface].

Let [formula], where Ci is an irreducible reduced curve, and mi is a natural number. We may assume that Ci  ≠  Cj for i  ≠  j, and [formula], where [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that the curve Ci contains exactly [formula] singular points of the surface S for every [formula] due to Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property]. Moreover, the curve C is smooth at every singular point of the surface S that is contained in the curve C by Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property].

Suppose that mγ = 1 for some [formula]. Then Cγ contains [formula] singular points of the surface S, but the curve S|Π must be singular at every singular point of the surface S that is contained in Cγ. Thus, we have

[formula]

but [formula] for i  ≠  γ. Hence, we have

[formula]

but on the plane Π we have the equalities

[formula]

which implies that [formula] and mi = 1 for every i. Now the equalities [\ref=equation:degrees] imply that the equality β  <  α holds, but every singular point of the surface S that is contained in the curve C must be an intersection point of C and the curve [formula], which consists of at most r2 points, which is a contradiction.

Hence, we have [formula] for every [formula]. Therefore, it follows from the equalities [\ref=equation:degrees] that α  =  β and mi = 2 for every i.

Let f(x,y,z,w) be the homogeneous form of degree 2r such that f = 0 defines the surface S, where (x:y:z:w) are homogeneous coordinates on [formula]. We may assume that the plane Π is given by the equation x = 0. Then f(0,y,z,w) = g2r(y,z,w), where gr is a homogeneous polynomial of degree r such that C is given by x = gr = 0, which implies that the surface S can be defined by the equation [\ref=equation:nodal-surface].

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property] that at most (2r - 1)k singular points of the surface S can lie on a curve of degree k. However, the claim of Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property] can be improved for curves that are not contained in two-dimensional linear subspaces of [formula].

Let C be an irreducible reduced curve in [formula] of degree k that is not contained in a hyperplane. Then [formula].

Suppose that the curve C contains at least (2r - 1)k - 1 singular points of the surface S. Then C  ⊂  S, because otherwise we have

[formula]

which leads to [formula], but [formula] and [formula].

Let O be a sufficiently general point of the curve C, and [formula] be a projection from the point O, where Π is a sufficiently general plane in [formula]. Then ψ|C is a birational morphism, because C is not a plane curve. Put Z = ψ(C). Then Z has degree k - 1.

Let Y be a cone in [formula] over Z with the vertex O. Then C  ⊂  Y.

It follows from the generality of the point O that the point O is not contained in a hyperplane in [formula] that is tangent to the surface S at some point of the curve C, because the curve C is not contained in a hyperplane. Therefore, the cone Y does not tangent the surface S along the curve C.

Put S|Y = C + R, where R is a curve of degree 2rk - k - 2r. Then the generality of the point O implies that the curve R does not contains rulings of the cone Y.

Let α:  →  Z be the normalization of Z. Then there is a commutative diagram

[formula]

where β is a birational morphism, [formula] is smooth, and π is a [formula]-bundle. Let L be a general fiber of π, and E be a section of π such that β(E) = O. Then E2 =  - k + 1 on [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be proper transforms of the curves C and R on the surface [formula] respectively, and Q be an arbitrary point of the set [formula]. Then there is a point ∈ such that β() = Q and [formula], but

[formula]

and [formula]. Therefore, we have [formula].

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:Hong-and-Park] by reductio ad absurdum. Put [formula], and suppose that the following conditions hold:

the inequalities [formula] and [formula] hold;

the surface S can not be defined by the equation [\ref=equation:nodal-surface];

the threefold X is not factorial, which implies that there is a point P∈Σ such that every surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 containing [formula] contains the point P.

We assume that [formula], because the case r = 3 is done in [\cite=HoPa04].

Let Π be a two-dimensional linear subspace in [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Let Γ be the subset of the set Σ that consists of all points that are not contained in the plane Π. Then Γ contains at most (2r - 1)(r - 1) - 1 points, which impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 5 by Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon].

Suppose that [formula]. Then there is a surface [formula] of degree 3r - 5 that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P. Hence, the union [formula] is the surface of degree 3r - 4 that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P, which is impossible due to our assumptions. Therefore, we have P∈Π.

The curve [formula] is singular in every point of the set [formula]. Thus, it follows from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property] that [formula], but Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-01] implies that [formula] is not contained in a curve of degree r if [formula]. The proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:surfaces-I] implies that there is a surface of degree 3r - 4 that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P, which concludes the proof by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].

The inequality [formula] holds by Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4].

Let L1 and L2 be distinct lines in [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property], and the lines L1 and L2 are not contained in one hyperplane by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03].

Fix two points Q1 and Q2 in [formula] different from P such that Q1  ≠  Q2, and let Πi be a plane in [formula] that contains Li and Qi. Then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03].

Suppose that [formula]. Then there is a surface [formula] of degree 3r - 6 that does not contain the point P and contains all points of the set

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon]. Hence, the surface [formula] is a surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 that contains all points of the set [formula] and does not contain the point P, which contradicts to our assumption. Therefore, we have [formula].

The set [formula] consists of 4r points by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03]. Therefore, the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms [formula] of degree 3r - 4 by Theorem 2 in [\cite=EiJ87]. On the other hand, the inequality

[formula]

holds, and the points of [formula] impose independent linear conditions homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 6 by Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon], which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].

Let C be a curve in [formula] of degree [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. We have [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property], and the curve C is not contained in a hyperplane by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03]. Therefore, the curve C is reducible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-02].

Let us put [formula], where [formula] and Ci is an irreducible curve. Then [formula], where di is the degree of the curve Ci, which implies [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property].

The curve Ci is contained in a hyperplane in [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-02]. So, the equalities di = 1 and α = k hold by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03] for all i, which contradicts Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-04], because [formula].

Let L be a line in [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose that the inequality [formula] holds. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. We have [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:star-property].

Let Φ be a hyperplane in [formula] such that Φ contains the line L, and Φ contains an arbitrary point of the set [formula]. Then Φ contains 2r points of the set Σ by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03].

Put [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose that the points of the set Δ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 5. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping] that the points of the set Σ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 4, because the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 4. Therefore, the points of the set Δ impose dependent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 5.

There is a point Q∈Δ such that every surface of degree 3r - 5 containing [formula] must contain Q, which implies |Δ| = (2r - 1)(r - 1) and |Σ| = (2r - 1)r + 1 by Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon].

Fix sufficiently general hyperplane [formula] and a point [formula]. Let [formula] be a projection from the point O. Put [formula] and [formula]. Then at most 2r - 2 points of the set [formula] lie on a line by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-04].

Suppose that at most (2r - 1)k points of the set [formula] lie on any curve in Π of degree k for every natural number k, and there is a curve Z  ⊂  Π of degree r - 1 that contains the whole set [formula]. Then the points of the set Δ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 5 by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional], [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-05] in the case when the curve Z is irreducible. So, we have [formula], where [formula], and Zi is an irreducible curve of degree di. Then [formula], which implies that Zi contains (2r - 1)di points of the set [formula], and every point of the set [formula] is contained in one irreducible component of the curve Z. In particular, we have di  ≠  1 for every i.

Let Zβ be the component of Z containing [formula], and Γ be a subset of Δ such that

[formula]

which implies Q∈Γ. There is a surface [formula] of degree 3(dβ - 1) that contains all point of the set [formula] and does not contain Q by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional], [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-05]. Let Yi be a cone over the curve Zi, whose vertex is the point O. Then the union [formula] is a surface of degree [formula] that contains [formula] and does not contains Q, which is impossible, because [formula]. Hence, we proved that

either at least (2r - 1)k + 1 points of [formula] lie on a curve in Π of degree k;

or there is no curve in Π of degree r - 1 that contains the whole set [formula].

Suppose that at most (2r - 1)k points of the set [formula] lie on every curve in Π of degree k for every natural k. Then the points of the set [formula] and the number 3r - 5 satisfy all hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese], because there is no curve in Π of degree r - 1 that contains the set [formula]. Hence, we can apply Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese] to the blow up of the plane Π at the points of the set [formula] to prove the existence of a curve in the plane Π of degree 3r - 5 that contains the set [formula] and does not contains the point [formula], which is a contradiction.

Therefore, at least (2r - 1)k + 1 points of the set [formula] lie on a curve in Π of degree k, where [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:conic]. Thus, the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition:3r-4-epsilon] implies the existence of a subset Ξ  ⊆  Δ such that the following conditions hold:

the points of Ξ impose independent linear conditions on surfaces of degree 3r - 5;

at most (2r - 1)k points of the set [formula] lie on a curve in Π of degree k;

there is a surface of degree [formula] that contains all points of the set Ξ and does not contain any point of the set [formula];

the inequality [formula] holds.

Put [formula] and d = 3r - 5 - μ. Then the points of [formula] impose dependent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree d by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping], which implies that there is a point ∈ such that [formula] and d do not satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese].

We have [formula], because [formula]. The proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:surfaces-IV] gives

[formula]

which implies that at least t(d + 3 - t) - 1 points of the finite set [formula] lie on a curve of degree t for some natural number t such that [formula].

Suppose that t = 1. At least d + 1 points of [formula] lie on a line, but at most 2r - 2 points of [formula] lie on a line by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-04], which implies that d = 2r - 3 and || = 2r - 2 points, which is impossible because the points of the set [formula] impose dependent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree d. Therefore, we see that [formula].

At least t(d + 3 - t) - 1 points of [formula] lie on a curve of degree [formula]. Then

[formula]

but [formula], because at most (2r - 1)t points of [formula] lie on a curve of degree t. Hence, we have [formula], which gives

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Let C be any curve in [formula] of degree k. Then [formula].

Fix a hyperplane [formula] and a general point [formula]. Let

[formula]

be a projection from O. Put [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is a bijection.

Let C be an irreducible curve in Π of degree r. Then [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Let Ψ be a subset of the set Σ consisting of the points that are mapped to the curve C by the projection ψ. Then [formula], but less than (2r - 1)r points of the set Σ lie on a curve of degree r by Corollary [\ref=corollary:Hong-Park-strick-inequality-for-curves].

Let H be a linear system of surfaces in [formula] of degree r that contains Ψ, and Φ be the base locus of H. Then Φ is finite Lemma [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional]. Put [formula]. Then the points of Υ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 3 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing].

Let Γ be a subset in Υ such that [formula] consists of 4r - 6 points. Then

[formula]

because [formula], which implies that there is a surface [formula] of degree r - 1 that contains all points of the set Γ. Let Θ be a subset of the set Υ such that Θ consists of all points that are contained in the surface F. Then the points of the set Θ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 4 by Theorem 3 in [\cite=DaGeOr85].

Put [formula]. Then the points of Δ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 2r - 3 by Theorem 2 in [\cite=EiJ87] and Lemmas [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-03] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-06]. So, the points of the set Υ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 4 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping], which also follows from Theorem 3 in [\cite=DaGeOr85], because (2r - 1)r + 1 < r3.

We have [formula]. Thus, the points of the set Σ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 4 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping], which is impossible.

There is a curve Z  ⊂  Π of degree k such that [formula].

Suppose that no (2r - 1)k + 1 points of the set [formula] lie on a curve of degree k for every natural number k. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

The finite subset [formula] and the natural number 3r - 4 does not satisfy ar least one of the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese], because every surface in [formula] of degree 3r - 4 containing all points of the set [formula] must contain the point P. However, the inequalities

[formula]

hold, and at most 3r - 4 points of the set [formula] can lie on a line, because [formula] and at most 2r - 1 points of the set [formula] can lie on a line by Lemma [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional].

We see that at least k(3r - 1 - k) - 1 points of the set [formula] lie on a curve of degree k such that [formula], which implies that k = r, because at most k(2r - 1) points of the set [formula] lie on a curve of degree k, and [formula]. Thus, we conclude that there is a curve C  ⊂  Π of degree r that contains at least (2r - 1)r - 1 points of [formula].

The curve C contains [formula], because otherwise there is a curve in Π of degree 3r - 4 that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point [formula]. Hence, the curve C contains at least (2r - 1)r points of the set [formula]. Thus, the curve C is reducible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-07].

Let [formula], where Ci is an irreducible curve of degree [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that the curve Ci contains (2r - 1)di points of the set Σ, and every point of the set Σ is contained in at most one curve Ci.

Let Cυ be the irreducible component of the curve C that contains [formula], and Υ be a subset of the set Σ that contains all points of the set Σ that are mapped to the curve Cυ by the projection ψ. Then |Υ| = (2r - 1)dυ, but less than (2r - 1)dυ points of the set Σ lie on a curve of degree dυ. Hence, the points of the set Υ impose independent linear conditions on the homogeneous forms of degree 3(dυ - 1) by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing].

There is a surface [formula] of degree 3(dυ - 1) that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P. Let Yi be a cone in [formula] over Ci with the vertex O. Then the surface

[formula]

contains [formula] and does not contain P, but [formula], which is a contradiction.

There is a disjoint union [formula], where Λij is a subset of the set Σ such that the inequality |Λij| > (2r - 1)j holds, all points of the subset ψ(Λij) is contained in an irreducible curve in Π of degree j, and at most (2r - 1)t points of the subset

[formula]

lie on a curve in Π of degree t. Then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:conic], and k < r by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-07].

Put [formula]. Let Ξij be the base locus of the linear system of surfaces in [formula] of degree j that contains all points of the set Λij. Then Ξij is a finite set by Lemma [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

The inequality [formula] holds, because the equality [formula] and the inequalities [\ref=equation:Hong-Park-main-inequality] imply that k = l = r, but k < r by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-07].

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing] that the points of Ξij impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3(j - 1). Put [formula]. Then

[formula]

There are surfaces F and G in [formula] of degree [formula] and [formula] respectively such that F contains [formula] and does not contain P, but G contains [formula] and does not contain any point in [formula]. In particular, we have [formula], because

[formula]

Put [formula] and [formula]. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping] that there is a point ∈ such that every curve in Π of degree d that contains [formula] must pass through the point [formula] as well. Therefore, we can not apply Theorem [\ref=theorem:Bese] to the points of the subset [formula] and the natural number d.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:surfaces-IV] implies that the inequality

[formula]

holds, but [formula], because [formula], which implies that at least t(d + 3 - t) - 1 points of [formula] lie on a curve in Π of degree [formula].

The inequality t  ≠  1 holds.

Suppose that t = 1. Then at least d + 1 points of the set [formula] lie on a line, which implies the inequality [formula] by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-06].

The inequality [formula] implies that [formula] and d = 2r - 3.

It follows from the inequality [\ref=equation:Hong-Park-auxiliary-inequality] that [formula], which implies that the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on the homogeneous forms of degree 2r - 3 by Theorem 2 in [\cite=EiJ87], which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].

There is a curve C  ⊂  Π of degree [formula] that contains at least t(d + 3 - t) - 1 points of the set [formula], which implies that [formula] and [formula], because at most (2r - 1)t points of the set [formula] lie on a curve of degree t. Therefore, we see that [formula], because [formula]. It follows from the inequalities [\ref=equation:Hong-Park-main-inequality] that

[formula]

which implies that [formula], the curve C contains all points of the set [formula], and the inequalities [\ref=equation:Hong-Park-main-inequality] are actually equalities. Namely, we have [formula] and

[formula]

which implies that l = k, ck = 1, d = 3r - 4 - k and [formula].

The curve C contains all points of the set [formula].

Suppose that C does not contain the set [formula]. Then C does not contains [formula], which implies that there is a curve in Π of degree r - k that contains the set [formula] does not contain the point [formula], which is impossible, because [formula].

Thus, the curve C is a curve of degree r - k that contains the set [formula], which consists of exactly (r - k)(2r - 1) points of the set ψ(Σ). On the other hand, there is an irreducible curve Z  ⊂  Π of degree k that contains all points of the set ψ(Λ), which consists of exactly k(2r - 1) + 1 points of the set ψ(Σ). In particular, we have

[formula]

The curve C is reducible.

Suppose that C is irreducible. Then the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on surfaces of degree 3(r - k - 1) by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional], [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-05], but the points of the set Λ impose independent linear conditions on surfaces of degree 3(k - 1) by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing], which implies that the points of the set Σ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3r - 4 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].

Therefore, we have [formula], where Ci is an irreducible curve of degree di, which implies that [formula], the curve Ci contains (2r - 1)di points of the set [formula] for every i, and every point of the set [formula] is contained in a single irreducible component of C.

The curve Z contains the point [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Let Cυ be an irreducible component of the curve C that contains the point [formula], and Υ be a subset of the set Σ that contains all points that are mapped to the curve Cυ by the projection ψ. Then Υ contains (2r - 1)dυ points.

The points of the set Υ impose independent linear conditions on the homogeneous forms of degree 3(dυ - 1) by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional], [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing] and [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-05]. Therefore, there is a surface [formula] of degree 3(dυ - 1) that contains [formula] and does not contain P.

Let Yi and Y be the cones in [formula] over the curves Ci and Z, respectively, whose vertex is the point O. Then the union [formula] is a surface of degree [formula] that contains the set [formula] and does not contain the point P, which is a contradiction.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hong-Park-12] implies that the points of the set [formula] impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms on [formula] of degree 3r - 4 - k, but we already know that the points of the set Λ impose independent linear conditions on homogeneous forms of degree 3(k - 1) by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:zero-dimensional] and [\ref=lemma:non-vanishing], which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:swapping].
