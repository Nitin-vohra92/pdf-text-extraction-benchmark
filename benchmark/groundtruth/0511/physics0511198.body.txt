Dipole trap for 87Rb atoms using lasers of different wavelength

Introduction

Trapping and storage of charged and neutral particles have laid pathways for advancement in physics [\cite=chu]. Neutral atoms are trapped on the basis of magnetic and optical interactions. Magnetic traps represent ideal conservative traps and arise from the state-dependent force on the permanent magnetic dipole moments in inhomogeneous field, restricting the experiments to only few special case. Optical dipole traps [\cite=grimm], which is much weaker than other trapping mechanism rely on the electric dipole interaction with far-detuned light. Under appropriate conditions, the dipole trapping mechanism is independent of the particular sub-level of the electronic ground-state. The internal ground state can thus be fully exploited for experiments which is not possible in magnetic trapping mechanism.

Frequency-detuning and potential depth for 87Rb atoms

Effective laser detuning Δ for alkali's can be calculated using,

where Δi is detuning from Di line.

For an alkali-metal atom, the maximum potential depth is calculated from [\cite=Cho],

The numerical value of saturation intensity I0 for D2 line ([formula]) atomic transition of 87Rb atoms is calculated to be 1.67 mW/cm2=16.7 W/m2 .

Frequency-detuning and potential depth using lasers of different wavelength

Below is the table with numerical values of detuning and potential depth for dipole traps using laser lights of different wavelength.

Atoms in an intense laser field experience an ac start shift. This shift creates a potential U proportional to the light intensity, such that

at the focus of a Gaussian laser beam, with r and z being the radial and axial co-ordinates, [formula] is the Rayleigh range at wavelength λ and beam waist W0. W(z) is the beam radius as a function of axial position z and is given by,

For a beam in horizontal direction the overall potential due to effect of gravity is given by,

Minimum power required to trap 87Rb atoms at distance z from the focal point of the beam

To calculate the minimum power required to trap 87Rb atoms at distance z from the focal point of the beam in the axial direction, the above equation (Eq. [\ref=pot]) is differentiated,

[formula]

[formula]

By substituting the appropriate values for the above equation (Eq. [\ref=diffpot]) one can calculate the minimum power required to trap atoms at distance z from the beam focus in the axial direction. Below is the table with the calculated power required to trap 87Rb atoms using laser light with different wavelengths and beam waist, 50 μm, 100 μm and 200 μm.

For light with beam waist, W0 = 50μm

for W0 = 100μm

for W0 = 200μm

The maximum photon scattering rate Γsc is given by
