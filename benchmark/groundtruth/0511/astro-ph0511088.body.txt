Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients: A new class of high mass X-ray binaries unveiled by INTEGRAL

Introduction

High Mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are X-ray sources composed of an early-type massive star and an accreting compact object. Most known HMXBs are Be/X-ray binaries, systems consisting of a neutron star accreting from the disc around a Be star. Even though a few Be/X-ray binaries are persistent weak X-ray sources (with [formula]), the majority are transients, displaying bright outbursts with typical duration on the order of several weeks.

The second major class of HMXBs contains early-type supergiants. The compact object is fed by accretion from the strong radiative wind of the supergiant. These objects are persistent sources, with luminosities around [formula], very variable on short timescales, but rather stable in the long run. Because of their relative brightness and persistent nature, it has been generally assumed that Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SGXBs) were easy to detect. About a dozen SGXBs were known before the launch of INTEGRAL, most of them having been discovered in the early days of X-ray astronomy. This low number was generally attributed to a real scarcity of such systems, as the short duration of the supergiant phase would result in very short lifetimes.

Since the launch of INTEGRAL, the situation is changing dramatically. Several new sources have been detected displaying the typical characteristics of SGXBs (Walter, these proceedings). In most cases, the sources had not been detected by previous missions due to high absorption, which renders their spectra very hard. Here we show that an even larger population of X-ray sources with OB supergiant companions may lie hidden in the Galaxy, undetected because of its transient nature.

X-ray sources with fast outbursts

XTE J1739-  302 = IGR J17391-  3021

XTE J1739-  302 was discovered during an outburst in August 1997 [\citep=smi98]. Further observations, mostly with RossiXTE, but also with ASCA showed it to be a strange transient with very short outbursts, lasting only a few hours [\citep=smi05]. Monitoring of the Galactic Centre region with INTEGRAL reveals that flares are rare, with typical intervals between outbursts of several months [\citep=sgue05].

The outbursts start with a very sharp rise (with a timescale < 1 h) and sometimes show complex structure, with several flare-like peaks [\citep=lut05a] [\citep=sgue05]. The X-ray spectrum during the outbursts is generally very absorbed, though the absorption is variable. Good fits can be achieved with either a power law with a high-energy cut-off or a thermal bremsstrahlung model with kT  ~  20  keV [\citep=smi05] [\citep=lut05a]. Such spectra are typical of accreting neutron stars in a HMXB. The luminosity at the peak of the outbursts approaches [formula], also typical of HMXBs.

The source was not detected during most of an ASCA pointing in March 1999 (with an upper limit LX < 1033  erg  s- 1), but went into outburst at the end of the same observation. Chandra detected the source at a moderate luminosity [formula], allowing the identification of the counterpart [\citep=smi05]. VLT/FORS1 spectra taken in May 2004 show the counterpart to be an O8 Iab(f) star, placed at a distance ≈  2.6  kpc [\citep=neg05]. Interstellar absorption is much lower than the absorption implied by X-ray spectral fits.

IGR J17544-  2619

IGR J17544-  2619 was discovered by INTEGRAL during a short flare (~  2  h; see Fig. [\ref=fig:outburst]) on 2003 September 17th [\citep=sun03]. Six hours later, it showed a longer (8 h) double-peaked outburst [\citep=greb03]. On 2004 March 8th, it showed a complex outburst lasting more than 8  h [\citep=greb04].

The source was observed by XMM-Newton on 2003 September 11th and 17th and in both cases seen at [formula] [\citep=gonz04], though it was not detected during a serendipitous observation in March 2003 ([formula]). Chandra may have observed its quiescent state on 2004 July 3rd, as it was detected at only [formula] and displaying a soft spectrum [\citep=zand05]. In outburst, the spectrum is hard and moderately absorbed, with evidence for some variation in the amount of absorbing material.

The counterpart to the source has been unambiguously identified with the XMM-Newton and Chandra positions. Spectra taken with NTT/EMMI show it to be an O9 Ib supergiant, with a weak wind (see Fig. [\ref=fig:two]) at a distance of ~  3  kpc [\citep=pel06].

IGR J16465-  4507

IGR J16465-  4507 was discovered by INTEGRAL during an X-ray flare on 2004 September 7th [\citep=lut04]. A subsequent XMM-Newton observation [\citep=lut05b] revealed that the source is a pulsar with Pspin  =  228  s and is extremely absorbed ([formula]).

No further flares have been reported, but the XMM-Newton error circle contains only one star. NTT/EMMI spectra of this object were taken in February and March 2005. The blue spectrum, displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:bsg], is rather noisy, but allows an approximate classification. While the object is very obviously an early B-type star, the strength of all metallic lines indicates that it is a supergiant. Comparison to the spectrum of the B1 Ib supergiant ζ Per rebinned to the same dispersion clearly shows that the lines are very broad for a supergiant, suggesting a very high rotational velocity, a typical characteristic of HMXBs.

The presence of strong  4650Å and moderate lines, while  4686Å is absent, is only compatible with a luminous star in the B0-  B1 range. Unfortunately, the signal to noise of the spectrum falls below ~  20 around λ4100Å and we cannot determine the strength of the lines that would allow an exact classification. The Hα spectrum (see Fig. [\ref=fig:two]) shows evidence for a moderate mass loss.

AX 1845.0-  0433

AX 1845.0-  0433 was discovered by ASCA during a strong flare in 1993. The outburst consisted of a very fast rise (on the order of a few minutes) followed by a number of peaks during the next few hours. The spectrum was well fit by an absorbed power law [\citep=yam95]. No further X-ray activity has been reported.

The ASCA error circle was studied by [\citet=coe96], who found only one remarkable object, a late O-type supergiant. This star has been monitored with the 1.3-m telescope at Skinakas observatory. Some of the spectra are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:axalpha]. The star shows strong Hα emission, typical of a luminous supergiant. Both the shape and strength of the line are variable, sometimes from night to night. Such variability is a typical signature of an interacting binary.

AX J1841.0-  0536

AX J1841.0-  0536 was observed as a violently variable transient by ASCA in April 1994 and then again in October 1999 [\citep=bam01]. The source showed multi-peaked flares with a sharp rise (tenfold increase in count-rate over [formula]h). Analysis of the ASCA data revealed that the source is a pulsar with Pspin  =  4.7  s. The spectrum can be fit by an absorbed power law plus iron line [\citep=bam01]. Based on the detection of X-ray flares with a sharp rise, [\citet=bam01] suggested that AX 1845.0  -  0433, AX J1841.0-  0536 and XTE J1739-  302 could be members of a class with common physical features.

A Chandra observation of the field revealed the counterpart to AX J1841.0-  0536, a reddened star with Hα in emission [\citep=hal04]. We have taken spectra of this star with the 2.2-m at Calar Alto and the 1.9-m at SAAO. Though the spectra are very noisy, they strongly resemble that of the counterpart to IGR J16465-  4507, displaying a very strong  4650Å line and no  4686Å. Therefore, it is also likely to be a luminous star in the B0-  1 range.

Some red spectra have been taken with the 1.3-m telescope at Skinakas observatory (see Fig. [\ref=fig:axjalpha]). Again we find a shape reminiscent of a P-Cygni profile and strong variability, lending support to the idea that the object is a supergiant rather than a Be star. A fast outburst observed by INTEGRAL (IGR J18410-  0535) has been attributed to this source [\citep=hg04].

Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients: A new class?

The five sources described in the previous section are characterised by the occurrence of X-ray outbursts of a very different nature from those seen in other X-ray binaries. These outbursts are very short (lasting from [formula] to [formula] hours) and present very sharp rises, reaching the peak of the flare in [formula]h. The decay is generally characterised by a complex structure, with two or three further flares. Three of the sources are associated with O-type supergiants. Though no pulsations have been detected, they display spectra typical of accreting neutron stars. The other two sources are X-ray pulsars and are associated with luminous early B-type stars. In all cases, the spectra show moderate or high absorption. In the case of XTE J1739-  302 and IGR J17544-  2619, which are better studied, the amount of absorbing material is variable.

We therefore propose that all these objects form a class of HMXBs which we call Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), because of the fast outbursts and supergiant companions. They differ from classical wind-fed SGXBs, whose X-ray luminosity is variable but always detectable around [formula]. Quiescent fluxes of SFXTs have been near the sensitivity limit of focusing observatories, with values or upper limits in the range of [formula] to [formula].

In spite of this difference, it must be noted that the commonalities between SFXTs and SGXBs are strong. As a matter of fact, at least three classical SGXBs have been observed to undergo bright flares on the same timescale: Vela X-1 [\citep=lau95] [\citep=kri03], 1E 1145.1-  6141 [\citep=bod04] and Cyg X-1 [\citep=gol03].

Other sources displaying fast outbursts

SAX J1818.6-  1703

SAX J1818.6-  1703 was discovered by BeppoSAX during a strong short outburst (with a rise time of ~  1  h), in March 1998 [\citep=zand98]. INTEGRAL detected a double-peaked outburst in September 2003 [\citep=gs05] and two more in October 2003 [\citep=sgue05]. Other fast outbursts have been observed with the ASM on RossiXTE [\citep=sgue05].

The X-ray lightcurve of SAX J1818.6-  1703 is typical of a SFXT. The X-ray spectrum is very hard [\citep=gs05]. The optical counterpart to SAX J1818.6-  1703 is not known. A bright early type star, HD 168078, is within both the BeppoSAX and INTEGRAL error circles. Spectra of this object, taken with the 1.3-m at Skinakas and the 1.9-m at SAAO show a normal B3 IV star, without indications of emission (see Fig. [\ref=fig:nosaxj]). As HD 168078 is not a convincing counterpart to SAX J1818.6-  1703, it might be worthwhile to search the error circle for a reddened supergiant.

IGR J16479-  4514

IGR J16479-  4514 was discovered by INTEGRAL during an outburst in August 2003 [\citep=mol03]. Several other short outbursts with very fast rise times were observed by INTEGRAL during 2003 [\citep=sgue05]. The X-ray spectrum of IGR J16479-  4514 is a power-law with high-energy cut-off, typical of a HMXB with a neutron star [\citep=lut05b]. All these characteristics are strongly suggestive of a SFXT.

XTE J1901+014

XTE J1901+014 was discovered by RXTE during a very bright outburst (reaching 0.9 Crab) that lasted less than 8  h, in 2002 [\citep=rs02]. Analysis of RXTE/ASM data revealed another fast outburst in 1997 [\citep=rs02]. Several outbursts have been observed by INTEGRAL. The INTEGRAL error circle contains two ROSAT sources and one Einstein source, one of which could represent the quiescent state of XTE J1901+014 [\citep=ste05].

AX J1749.1-  2733

AX J1749.1-  2733 was observed by ASCA at a relatively low luminosity on several occasions [\citep=sak02]. It has recently been reported to show fast X-ray outbursts during INTEGRAL observations (Grebenev, quoted in In't Zand 2005).

Discussion & Conclusions

Most X-ray transients, whether Be/X-ray binaries or low mass X-ray binaries (having either neutron star or black hole companions), display outbursts typically lasting from a few weeks to months. Such durations are compatible with viscous timescales in a typical accretion disc. Fast outbursts, with much shorter durations, must be due to a completely different physical mechanism. Here we have shown that at least a fraction of the recurrent fast X-ray transients are associated with luminous OB stars, suggesting that the mass transfer mechanism feeding the accreting compact object is a radiative wind, and therefore have identified the class of SFXTs.

We must note that not every source displaying short X-ray outbursts may be assigned to the class of SFXTs. Flare stars and RS CVn binaries display short X-ray flares and superbursts from low mass X-ray binaries have similar durations, though rather different luminosities and lightcurves [\citep=gs05]. The HMXB 1A 0535-  668, in the LMC, has shown very bright X-ray outbursts lasting only a few days, but these outbursts are locked in phase with the orbital period of the system and may be related to periastron passage in a very eccentric orbit [\citep=cha83]. IGR J00370+6122 could be a similar system [\citep=rei05]. The black hole transient V4641 Sgr should not be grouped with SFXTs either. In this system, the mass donor is a B9 III giant [\citep=oro01], which is not a massive star and cannot have a radiative wind. Moreover, its 1999 outburst was highly super-Eddington and accompanied by a huge optical brightening, properties that set it completely apart from SFXTs [\citep=rev02].

However, there are strong reasons to believe that the class of SFXTs comprises a much larger number of sources than the five objects described above. In Section [\ref=sec:others], we list four reliable candidates, but other known sources might belong to this class. For example, the X-ray transient IGR J11215-  5952 was observed by INTEGRAL during the decaying phase of an outburst. It is likely to be related to SFXTs if its association to the B1 Ia supergiant HD 306414 is confirmed [\citep=atel].

If only some of these candidates are confirmed, the number of SFXTs would already be comparable to that of classical SGXBs. We must consider, however, that classical SGXBs are persistent bright X-ray sources, while SFXTs are transient sources with very short duty cycles. Most of them are detectable, unless directly pointed at by Chandra or XMM-Newton, only for a few hours every several months. It is hence not surprising that most of the SFXTs so far found lie on the vicinity of the Galactic Centre, a region extensively monitored by INTEGRAL and other satellites.

But, if SFXTs are very difficult to detect, and we already know several of them in the region around the Galactic Centre, the implication is that the population of SFXTs in the Galaxy is much larger than the ten or so objects already known. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to avoid concluding that most binaries containing a supergiant and a compact object must be SFXTs or entirely quiescent. If we take into account the large number of obscured persistent HMXBs that INTEGRAL is discovering, it seems clear that the numbers of HMXBs must have been severely underestimated.

The physical reason for fast outbursts is still unknown. [\citet=gol03] speculated that the outbursts in Cyg X-1 could be due to some form of discrete mass ejection from the supergiant donor. [\citet=zand05] also suspects that wind variability is the cause of fast outbursts. As we have shown here, an important fraction of fast transients have supergiant companions and at least three classical SGXBs have shown fast outbursts. It seems then that the fast outbursts are related to the mass transfer mode, wind accretion. They cannot be related to the nature of the companion, as they are seen in black hole systems (Cyg X-1), slow X-ray pulsars (IGR J16465-  4507) and faster X-ray pulsars (AX J1841.0-  0536).

There is increasing evidence suggesting that the winds of B-type supergiants are highly structured and may have a fundamentally clumpy nature [\citep=pri05]. If these clumps survive to the distance at which the compact object is orbiting, they could give rise to sudden episodes of increased accretion rate. Alternatively, the outbursts could be related to the instability believed to be intrinsic to the wind accretion process [\citep=fog05].

On the other hand, there is nothing in the optical properties of SFXTs setting them apart from classical SGXBs. It is therefore difficult to understand why their quiescent X-ray luminosities are rather lower. A possibility would be that SFXTs have wider orbits than SGXBs, and the compact object (in most cases, a neutron star) accretes from a less dense environment. This, however, would not explain why the sources spend some (still not quantified) fraction of time below detectability. If highly eccentric, wide orbits are invoked in order to explain the periods of very low X-ray luminosity, one would naïvely expect some (quasi-)periodicity in the recurrence of the outbursts, that has not been observed, as they would have to occur always relatively close to periastron.

Clearly, a more complete investigation of all the sources presented here is needed before common trends start to emerge and a characterisation of the group of SFXTs can be achieved. Understanding the reasons for their X-ray behaviour and the source of the difference with classical SGXBs will undoubtedly increase our knowledge of the accretion process and very likely provide valuable insights into the different paths leading to the formation of HMXBs and their subsequent evolution.
