On the Inner Radius of Nodal Domains

Introduction and Main Results

Let (M,g) be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension n. Let Δ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on M. Let [formula] be the eigenvalues of Δ. Let φλ be an eigenfunction of Δ with eigenvalue λ. A nodal domain is a connected component of {φλ  ≠  0}.

We are interested in the asymptotic geometry of the nodal domains. In particular, in this paper we consider the inner radius of nodal domains.

Let rλ be the inner radius of the λ-nodal domain Uλ. Let [formula] denote constants which depend only on (M,g). We prove

Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension n  ≥  3. Then

[formula]

where k(n) = n2 - 15n / 8 + 1 / 4.

In dimension two we have the following sharp bound

Let Σ be a closed Riemannian surface. Then

Upper Bound

We remark that the upper bound is more or less standard and has been used in the literature (e.g. [\cite=don-fef-yau]). However, we explain it here also.

We observe that λ  =  λ1(Uλ). This is true since the λ-eigenfunction does not vanish in Uλ ([\cite=chavel], ch. I.5). Therefore, the existence of the upper bound in Theorems [\ref=thm:inrad] and [\ref=thm:inrad2] follows from the following general upper bound on λ1 of domains Ω  ⊆  M.

[formula]

The proof of this theorem is given in §[\ref=sec:gen-bounds].

Lower Bound

For the lower bound on the inner radius in dimensions ≥  3, we give a proof in §[\ref=sec:lower3] which is based on a local behavior of eigenfunctions discovered by H. Donnelly and C. Fefferman (Theorem [\ref=thm:loc-cour]). The same proof gives in dimension two the bound [formula].

In order to get rid of the factor [formula] in dimension two, we treat this case separately in §[\ref=subsec:lower2]. The proof for this case can basically be found in [\cite=ego-kon], and we bring it here for the sake of clarity and completeness.

For the dimension two case we also bring a new proof in §[\ref=sec:nazpolsod]. Moreover, this proof shows that a big inscribed ball can be taken to be with center at a maximal point of the eigenfunction in the nodal domain. This proof is due to F. Nazarov, L. Polterovich and M. Sodin and is based on complex analytic methods.

A Short Background

Related to the problem discussed in this paper is the problem of estimating the (n - 1)-Hausdorff measure Hn - 1(λ) of the nodal set, i.e. the set where an eigenfunction vanishes. J. Brüning and D. Gromes proved in [\cite=brun-gromes] and [\cite=bruning] sharp lower estimates in dimension two. Namely, they showed [formula]. An estimate of the constant C is given in [\cite=savo]. Later, S. T. Yau conjectured that in any dimension [formula]. This was proved in the case of analytic metrics by H. Donnelly and C. Fefferman in [\cite=don-fef-yau].

Regarding the inner radius of nodal domains, we would like to mention the recent work of B. Xu [\cite=xubin], in which he obtains a sharp lower bound on the inner radius for at least two nodal domains, and the work of V. Maz'ya and M. Shubin [\cite=maz-shub], in which they give sharp bounds on the inner capacity radius of a nodal domain.

The Lower Bound on the Inner Radius

In this section we prove the existence of the lower bounds on the inner radius given in Theorems [\ref=thm:inrad] and [\ref=thm:inrad2].

Lower Bound in Dimension ≥   3

In this section we prove the existence of the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=thm:inrad]. The proof also gives a bound in the case where dim M  =  2, namely [formula], but in the next section we treat this case separately to get rid of the [formula] factor.

Let {σi} be a finite cellulation of M by cubes, such that for each i we can put a Euclidean metric ei on σi, which satisfies ei / 4  ≤  g  ≤  4ei. Let rλ,i be the inner radius of [formula], and rλ,i,e be the Euclidean inner radius of Uλ,i. Notice that

[formula]

Step 1. (See Fig. [\ref=fig:inrad]). We consider σi as a compact cube in [formula], with edges parallel to the axes directions. We cover σi by non-overlapping small cubes with edges of size 4h, where rλ,i,e < h < 2rλ,i,e. Let Q be a copy of one of these small cubes. Let Q' be a concentric cube with parallel edges of size 2h.

Step 2. We note that each copy of Q' contains a point [formula].

Otherwise, we would have rλ,i,e  ≥  h, which would contradict the definition of h.

Step 3. Denote by [formula] the connected component of [formula] which contains p. We claim

[formula]

where α(n) = 2n2 + n / 4, and [formula] denotes the Euclidean volume. We will denote the right hand side term of ([\ref=eqn:loc-cour]) by γ(λ).

Indeed, [formula] is a connected component of [formula] for some λ-nodal domain Uλ'. Hence, we can apply the following Local Courant's Nodal Domain Theorem.

Let B  ⊆  M be a fixed ball. Let B' be a concentric ball of half the radius of B. Let Uλ be a λ-nodal domain which intersects B'. Let Bλ be a connected component of [formula]. Then

[formula]

where α(n) = 2n2 + n / 4.

We remark that in our case ([\ref=eqn:df]) is true also for the quotient of Euclidean volumes, since the Euclidean metric on σi is comparable with the metric coming from M.

Step 4. We let λ  =  χ(Uλ)φλ, where χ(Uλ) is the characteristic function of Uλ, and similarly, [formula]. Then we have the inequality

[formula]

where

[formula]

Observe that λ,i vanishes on [formula]. We will use the following Poincaré type inequality due to Maz'ya. We discuss it in §[\ref=subsec:poinca-cap]. A general version of this inequality with weights instead of Lebesgue measure is proved in [\cite=chan-wheed].

Let [formula] be a cube whose edge is of length a. Let 0 < γ < 1. Then,

[formula]

for all Lipschitz functions u on Q, which vanish on a set of measure ≥  γan, and where

[formula]

From ([\ref=eqn:loc-cour]) and Theorem [\ref=thm:poinca-vol] applied to λ,i, it follows Since the metric on σi is comparable to the Euclidean metric, we have also inequality ([\ref=ineq:loc_lambda]).

Step 5.

[formula]

This is obtained by summing up inequalities ([\ref=ineq:loc_lambda]) over all cubes Q which cover σi, and recalling that h < 2rλ,i,e  ≤  4rλ.

Step 6. We sum up ([\ref=ineq:triangle]) over all cubical cells σi to obtain a global inequality.

[formula]

Step 7.

[formula]

Indeed, by ([\ref=ineq:global])

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Lower Bound in Dimension =   2

We prove the existence of the lower bound on the inner radius in Theorem [\ref=thm:inrad2]. The arguments below can basically be found in [\cite=ego-kon], Chapter 7.

We begin the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:inrad2] with Step 1 and Step 2 of §[\ref=sec:lower3]. We proceed as follows.

Step 3'. If [formula] does not touch ∂Q

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Euclidean area.

We recall the Faber-Krahn inequality in [formula].

Let [formula] be a bounded domain. Then [formula]

We apply Theorem [\ref=thm:faber-krahn] with [formula]. We emphasize that [formula], since the two metrics are comparable.

Thus, we obtain

[formula]

or, written differently, [formula]. On the other hand, [formula], where the last inequality is the upper bound on the inner radius in Theorem [\ref=thm:inrad2]. So take C1 = C4 / (64C5).

Step 4' (part a). There exists an edge of Q, on which the orthogonal projection of [formula] is of Euclidean size ≥  γ  ·  4h, where 0 < γ < 1 is independent of λ.

Let us denote by [formula] the maximal size of the projections of [formula] on one of the edges of Q. If [formula] touches ∂Q, then [formula], and we can take γ = 1 / 4. Otherwise, by Step 3'

[formula]

So, we can take [formula].

Step 4' (part b).

[formula]

Notice that λ,i vanishes on [formula]. Hence, Step 4' (part a) permits us to apply the following Poincaré type inequality to λ,i. Its proof is given in §[\ref=sec:poinca-2]. An inequality in the same spirit can be found in [\cite=leonsimon].

Let [formula] be a cube whose edge is of length a. Let u be a Lipschitz function on Q which vanishes on a curve whose projection on one of the edges is of size ≥  γa. Then

[formula]

Steps 5'-7'. To conclude we continue in the same way as in Steps 5-7 of §[\ref=sec:lower3].

A New Proof in Dimension Two

This section is due to L. Polterovich, M. Sodin and F. Nazarov. In dimension two we give a proof based on the harmonic measure and the fact due to Nadirashvili that an eigenfunction on the scale comparable to the wavelength is almost harmonic in a sense to be defined below. This proof also gives information about the location of a big ball inscribed in the nodal domain Uλ. Namely, we show that if φλ(x0)  =   max Uλ|φλ|, then one can find a ball of radius [formula] centered at x0 and inscribed in Uλ.

Let Dp  ⊆  Σ be a metric disk centered at p. Let f be a function defined on D. Let [formula] denote the unit disk in [formula].

We say that f is (K,δ)-quasiharmonic if there exists a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism [formula], a harmonic function u on [formula], and a function v on [formula] with 1 - δ  ≤  v  ≤  1, such that

[formula]

Remark. We will assume without loss of generality that h(p) = 0.

There exist K,ε,δ > 0 such that for every eigenvalue λ and disk D  ⊆  Σ of radius [formula], φλ|D is (K,δ)-quasiharmonic.

We now choose a preferred system of conformal coordinates on (Σ,g).

There exist positive constants q+,q-,ρ such that for each point p∈M, there exists a disk Dp,ρ centered at p of radius ρ, a conformal map [formula] with Ψp(0) = p, and a positive function q(z) on [formula] such that

[formula]

with q- < q  <  q+.

Let us take a point p, where |φλ| admits its maximum on Uλ. Let [formula]. Let [formula] be a disk of radius [formula] centered at p.

We now take the functions u,v defined on [formula] which correspond to [formula] in Theorem [\ref=thm:harmon]. We observe that for all [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Now we apply the harmonic measure technic. Let [formula] be the connected component of {u > 0}, which contains 0. Let [formula]. Let ω be the harmonic measure of E in [formula]. ω is a bounded harmonic function on U0λ, which tends to 1 on [formula] and to 0 on the interior points of [formula]. Let r0  =   inf {|z|:  z∈E}.

By the Beurling-Nevanlinna theorem ([\cite=conf-inv], sec. 3-3),

[formula]

By the majorization principle

[formula]

Combining inequalities ([\ref=ineq:max]), ([\ref=ineq:be-ne-nad]) and ([\ref=ineq:major-nad]) gives us

[formula]

In the final step we apply a distortion theorem proved by Mori for quasiconformal maps. Denote by [formula] the disk {|z|  <  r}. Observe that

[formula]

Hence, we can compose

[formula]

h̃ is a K-quasiconformal map. By Mori's Theorem ([\cite=quasiconf], Ch. III.C) it is [formula]-Hölder. Moreover, it satisfies an inequality

[formula]

with M depending only on K. Inequalities ([\ref=ineq:r-c]) and ([\ref=ineq:mori]) imply that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

as desired.

A Review of Poincaré Type Inequalities

We give an overview of several Poincaré type inequalities. In particular, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:poinca-vol] and Theorem [\ref=thm:poinca-dim2].

Poincaré Inequality and Capacity

Theorem [\ref=thm:poinca-vol] is a direct corollary of the following two inequalities proved by Maz'ya.

Let [formula] be a cube whose edge is of length a. Let F  ⊆  Q. Then

[formula]

for all Lipschitz functions u on Q which vanish on F.

A few remarks:

2Q denotes a cube concentric with Q, with parallel edges of size twice as large.

If [formula] is an open set, and   ⊆  Ω, then [formula] denotes the L2-capacity of F in Ω, namely

[formula]

where [formula]

By Rademacher's Theorem ([\cite=ziemer]), a Lipschitz function is differentiable almost everywhere, and thus the right hand side has a meaning.

A generalization of the inequality to a body which is starlike with respect to a ball is proved in [\cite=maz-shub-disc].

The next theorem is a capacity-volume inequality.

[formula]

In particular, for [formula] we have

A Poincaré Inequality in Dimension Two

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:poinca-dim2]. The proof can be found in chapter 7 of [\cite=ego-kon]. We bring it here for the sake of clarity.

Let the coordinates be such that Q = {0  ≤  x1,x2  ≤  a}. Let the given edge be [formula], and let [formula] denote the projection from Q onto this edge. Set [formula]. We claim

[formula]

Indeed, let [formula].

We recall the following Poincaré type inequality in dimension one whose proof is given below.

[formula]

for all Lipschitz functions u on

[formula]

.

By this lemma

[formula]

Integrating over [formula] gives us ([\ref=ineq:E-Q]).

Next we show

[formula]

By the mean value theorem [formula] such that

[formula]

In addition, we have

[formula]

Integrating the last inequality over Q gives us

[formula]

Finally, we combine ([\ref=ineq:E-Q]), ([\ref=ineq-avg]) and ([\ref=ineq-mid]) to get ([\ref=ineq:var2]).

[formula]

A Poincaré Inequality in Dimension One

We prove Lemma [\ref=ineq:poin-1].

By scaling, it is enough to prove ([\ref=eqn:poin-1]) for the segment

[formula]

|u(x)| =| u'(t)  t|≤ |u'(t)|  t.

[formula]

to get the desired inequality.

λ1 and Inner Radius

We prove Theorem [\ref=thm:inrad-gen], which relates the inner radius to λ1.

Let {Vi} be a finite open cover of M, such that for each i one can put a Euclidean metric ei on Vi, which satisfies ei / 4  ≤  g  ≤  4ei. Let α be the Lebesgue number of the covering.

Let [formula]. Let B  ⊆  Ω be a ball of radius r. We can assume that B  ⊆  V1. Let Be  ⊆  B be a Euclidean ball of radius r / 2. By monotonicity of λ1, we know that λ1(Ω,g)  ≤  λ1(B,g)  ≤  λ1(Be,g), but since the Riemannian metric on Be is comparable to the Euclidean metric on it, it follows from the variational principle that

[formula]

where in the last inequality we used the fact that [formula].

Remark. We would like to emphasize that in general there is no lower bound on λ1 is terms of the inner radius. However, in dimension two, as pointed out to us by Daniel Grieser and Mikhail Shubin, there exists a lower bound on λ1 in terms of the inner radius and the connectivity of Ω. This was proved in [\cite=hayman] and [\cite=osserman]. For a more detailed account of the subject one can consult [\cite=lieblow].
