New Mechanism of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions Using Superlow Energy External Fields Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia e-mail:gareev@thsun1.jinr.ru

Introduction

The review of possible stimulation mechanisms of LENR (low energy nuclear reaction) is presented in [\cite=2]. We have concluded that transmutation of nuclei at low energies and excess heat are possible in the framework of the known fundamental physical laws � the universal resonance synchronization principle [\cite=1] and based on it different enhancement mechanisms of reaction rates are responsible for these processes [\cite=2]. The excitation and ionization of atoms may play the role of a trigger for LENR. Superlow energy of external fields may stimulate LENR [\cite=3]. Investigation of this phenomenon requires the knowledge of different branches of science: nuclear and atomic physics, chemistry and electrochemistry, condensed matter and solid state physics,... The puzzle of poor reproducibility of experimental data is the fact that LENR occurs in open systems and it is extremely sensitive to parameters of external fields and systems. The classical reproducibility principle should be reconsidered for LENR experiments. Poor reproducibility and unexplained results do not mean that the experiment is wrong. Our main conclusion is: LENR may be understood in terms of the known fundamental laws without any violation of the basic physics. The fundamental laws of physics should be the same in micro- and macrosystems. Let us start with the description of the hydrogen atom structure in different models

The Hydrogen Atom

We will describe very shortly the structure of a hydrogen atom using standard basic physics that is well established, both theoretically and experemintally in micro- and macrosystems.

The Bohr Model

At the end of the 19th century it was established that the radiation from hydrogen was emitted at specific quantized frequencies. Niels Bohr developed the model to explain this radiation using four postulates:

1. An electron in an atom moves in a circular orbit about the nucleus under the influence of the Coulomb attraction between the electron and the nucleus, obeying the laws of classical mechanics.

2. Instead of the infinity of orbits which would be possible in classical mechanics, it is only possible for an electron to move in an orbit for which its orbital angular momentum L is integral multiple of [formula]:

[formula]

3. Despite the fact that it is constantly accelerating, an electron moving in a such an allowed orbit does not radiate electromagnetic energy. Thus, its total energy E remains constant.

4. Electromagnetic radiation is emitted if an electron, initially moving in an orbit of total energy Ei, discontinuously changes its motion so that it moves in an orbit of total energy Ef.The frequency ν of the emitted radiation is equal to the quantity

[formula]

where h is Planck's constant. The electron is held in a stable circular orbit around a nucleus. The Coulomb force is equal to the centripetal force, according to Newton's second law

[formula]

where r is is the radius of the electron orbit, and v is the electron speed. The force is central; hence from the quantization condition (1)

[formula]

After solving equations (3) and (4) we have

[formula]

>From equation (3) the kinetic energy is equal to

[formula]

and hence the total energy

[formula]

Having r from equation (5) one can write the expression for the energy levels for hydrogen atoms

[formula]

the same results were obtained further by quantum mechanics.

Using the angular momentum quantization condition L = pr = nh / 2π and Louis de Broglie's relationship p = h / λ between momentum and wavelength one can get

[formula]

[formula] It means that the circular Bohr orbit is an integral number of the de Broglie wavelengths. The Bohr model is actually only accurate for a one-electron system.

The Hydrogen Atom in Classical Mechanics

Is it possible to understand some properties of a hydrogen atom from classical mechanics ? The Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom is

[formula]

All notation is standard. The definition of center of mass is

[formula]

and the relative distance between electron and proton is

[formula]

Equations (10)-(12) lead to the results:

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

The Hamiltonian (14) coincides with the Hamiltonian for the fictitious material point with reduced mass μ moving in the external field - e2 / r. If we known the trajectory of this fictitious particle [formula] then we can reconstruct the trajectories of electron and proton using equations (13)

[formula]

It is evident from (16) that the proton and electron move in the opposite directions synchronously. So the motions of proton, electron and their relative motion occur with equal frequency

[formula]

over the closed trajectories scaling by the ratio

[formula]

I.A. Schelaev [\cite=SCH04] proved that the frequency spectrum of any motion on ellipse contains only one harmonic.

We can get from (16) that

[formula]

where - [formula]. All three impulses are equal to each other in absolute value, which means the equality of

[formula]

Conclusion: [formula] Therefore, the motions of proton and electron and their relative motion occur with the same FREQUENCY, IMPULSE (linear momentum) and the de Broglie WAVELENGTH. All motions are synchronized and self-sustained. Therefore the whole system -hydrogen atom is nondecomposable to the independent motions of proton and electron despite the fact that the kinetic energies ratio of electron to proton one is small:

[formula]

It means that the nuclear and corresponding atomic processes must be considered as a unified entirely determined whole process.

For example, V.F. Weisskopf [\cite=6] come to conclusion that the maximum height H of mountains in terms of the Bohr radius a is equal to

[formula]

and water waves lengths λ on the surface of a lake in terms of the Bohr radius is equal to

[formula]

Let us introduce the quantity f = rv which is the invariant of motion, according to the second Keplers law, then

[formula]

and we can rewrite equation (14) in the following way

[formula]

We can obtain the minimal value of (21) by taking its first derivative over r and setting it equal to zero. The minimal value occurs at

[formula]

and the result is

[formula]

The values of invariant of motion μf (in MeV*s) can be calculate from (23)if we require the equality of Emin to the energy of ground state of a hydrogen atom

[formula]

Conclusion: [formula] The Bohr quantization conditions were introduced as hypothesis. We obtain these conditions from a classical Hamiltonian requiring its minimality. It is necessary to strongly stress that no assumption was formulated about trajectories of proton and electron. We reproduced exactly the Bohr result and modern quantum theory. The Plank constant [formula] is the Erenfest adiabatic invariant for a hydrogen atom: μvr  =  .

Let us briefly review our steps:

[formula] We used a well established interaction between proton and electron.

[formula] We used a fundamental fact that the total energy=kinetic energy+potential energy.

[formula] We used the second Kepler law.

[formula] We used usual calculus to determine the minimum values of H.

[formula] We required the equality of Emin to the energy of ground state of hydrogen atom.

Classical Hamiltonian + classical interaction between proton and electron + classical second Kepler law + standard variational calculus - these well establish steps in macrophysics reproduce exactly results of the Bohr model and modern quantum theory (Schrodinger equation) - results of microphysics. We have not done anything spectacular or appealed to any revolutionary and breakthrough physics.

M. Gryzinski [\cite=GRY04] has proved using the Newton equation with well established interactions that atoms have the quasi-crystal structure with definite angles: [formula], [formula] and [formula], which are the well-known angles in crystallography.

Nuclei and Atoms as Open Systems

1) LENR may be understood in terms of the known fundamental laws without any violation of the basic physics. The fundamental laws of physics should be the same in micro- and macrosystems.

2)Weak and electromagnetic interactions may show a strong influence of the surrounding conditions on the nuclear processes.

3)The conservation laws are valid for closed systems. Therefore, the failure of parity in weak interactions means that the corresponding systems are open systems. Periodic variations (24 hours, 27, and 365 days in beta-decay rates indicate that the failure of parity in weak interactions has a cosmophysical origin. Modern quantum theory is the theory for closed systems. Therefore, it should be reformulated for open systems. The closed systems are idealization of nature, they do not exist in reality.

4)The universal resonance synchronization principle is a key issue to make a bridge between various scales of interactions and it is responsible for self-organization of hierarchical systems independent of substance, fields, and interactions. We give some arguments in favor of the mechanism � ORDER BASED on ORDER, declared by Schrodinger in [\cite=4], a fundamental problem of contemporary science.

5)The universal resonance synchronization principle became a fruitful interdisciplinary science of general laws of self-organized processes in different branches of physics because it is the consequence of the energy conservation law and resonance character of any interaction between wave systems. We have proved the homology of atom, molecule and crystal structures including living cells. Distances of these systems are commensurable with the de Broglie wave length of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom, it plays the role of the standard distance, for comparison.

6)First of all, the structure of a hydrogen atom should be established. Proton and electron in a hydrogen atom move with the same frequency that creates attractive forces between them, their motions are synchronized. A hydrogen atom represents radiating and accepting antennas (dipole) interchanging energies with the surrounding substance. The sum of radiate and absorb energy flows by electron and proton in a stable orbit is equal to zero [\cite=5] � the secret of success of the Bohr model (nonradiation of the electron on stable orbit). �The greatness of mountains, the finger sized drop, the shiver of a lake, and the smallness of an atom are all related by simple laws of nature� � Victor F. Weisskopf [\cite=6]

7)These flows created standing waves due to the resonance synchronization principle. A constant energy exchange with substances (with universes) create stable auto-oscillation systems in which the frequencies of external fields and all subsystems are commensurable. The relict radiation (the relict isotropic standing waves at T=2.725 K � the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)) and many isotropic standing waves in cosmic medium [\cite=7] should be results of self-organization of the stable hydrogen atoms, according to the universal resonance synchronization principle that is a consequence of the fundamental energy conservation law. One of the fundamental predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory for the creation of the Universe is CMBR.

8)The cosmic isotropic standing waves (many of them are not discovered jet) should play the role of a conductor responsible for stability of elementary particles, nuclei, atoms,�, galaxies ranging in size more than 55 orders of magnitude.

9)The phase velocity of standing microwaves can be extremely high; therefore all objects of the Universe should get information from each other almost immediately using phase velocity.

The aim of this paper is to discuss the possibility of inducing and controlling nuclear reactions at low temperatures and pressures by using different low energy external fields and various physical and chemical processes. The main question is the following: is it possible to enhance LENR rates by using low and extremely low energy external fields? The review of possible stimulation mechanisms is presented in [\cite=2] [\cite=5]. We will discuss new possibilities to enhance LENR rates in condensed matter.

LENR in Condensed Matter

The modern understanding of the decay of the neutron is

[formula]

The analysis of the energetics of the decay can be performed using the concept of binding energy and the masses of particles by their rest mass energies. The energy balance from neutron decay can be calculated from the particle masses. The rest mass difference ( 0.7823MeV / c2) between neutron and (proton+electron) is converted to the kinetic energy of proton, electron and neutrino. The neutron is about 0.2% more massive than a proton, an energy difference is 1.29 MeV / c2. A free neutron will decay with a half-life of about 10.3 minutes. Neutron in a nucleus will decay if a more stable nucleus results otherwise neutron in a nucleus will be stable. A half-life of neutron in nuclei changes dramatically and depends on the isotopes.

It is possible the capture electrons by protons

[formula]

but for free protons and electrons this reaction has never been observed which is the case in nuclear+ atomic physics. The capture electrons by protons in a nucleus will occurs if a more stable nucleus results.

Cooperative Processes

The processes (25) and (26) in LENR are going with individual nucleons and electrons. In these cases the rest mass difference is equal to 0.7823MeV / c2. In the case neutron decay corresponding energy (Q = 0.7823 MeV) converted to kinetic energies of proton, electron and antineutrino. In the case capture electrons by protons the quantity Q = 0.7823 MeV is a threshold electron kinetic energy less which process (26) forbidden for free proton and electron.

We have formulated the following postulate: [formula] The processes (25) and (26) in LENR are going in the whole system: cooperative processes including all nucleons in nuclei and electrons in atoms, in condensed matter. In these cases a threshold energy Q can be drastically decreased by internal energy of whole system or even more - the electron capture by proton can be accompanied by emission of internal binding energy - main source of excess heat phenomenon in LENR.

The processes (25) and (26) are weak processes. A weak interaction which is responsible for electron capture and other forms of beta decay is of a very short range. So the rate of electron capture and emission (internal conversion) is proportional to the density of electrons at the nuclei. It means that we can manage the electron-capture (emission) rate by the change of the total electron density at the nuclei using different low energy external fields. These fields can play a role of triggers for extracting internal energy of whole system or subsystems, changing quantum numbers of the initial states such way that forbidden transitions become allowed ones. The distances between proton and electron in atoms are order 10- 6 -  - 10- 5 cm and any external field decreasing these distances even for small value, can increase process (26) in nuclei exponential way. Therefore, the influence of external electron flux (discharge in condensed matter: breakdown, spark and ark) on the velocities processes (25) and (26) can be great importance.

The role of external electrons is the same as the catalytic role of neutrons in the case of the chain fission reactions in nuclei - neutrons bring to nuclei binding energies (about 8 MeV) which enhance the fission rates about 30 orders.

Predicted Effects and Experimentum Cruices

Postulated enhancement mechanism of LENR by external fields can be verified by the Exprimentum Cruices. We [\cite=5] predicted that natural geo-transmutation in the atmosphere and earth occur at the the regions of strong change in geo-, bio-, acoustic-,... and electromagnetic fields.

The various electrodynamic processes at thunderstorms are responsible for different phenomena: electromagnetic pulses, γ-rays, electron fluxes, neutron fluxes, radioactive nuclei fluxes.

Production of Radiocarbon and Failing of Radiocarbon Dating

The half-life of radiocarbon 14C is 5730 years. It was developed a method for historical chronometry assuming that the decay ratio of 14C is constant on time. Radiocarbon dating is widely used in archeology, geology, antiquities,... Let us consider the reaction

[formula]

the Tk(e)=156.41 keV is the threshold energy which should by compared with 782.3 keV for process (26). Production of radiocarbon by lighting bolts was established in [\cite=LIB73]. Unfortunately, this means failing of radiocarbon dating.

Production Radiophosphorus by Thunderstorms

The life-times of 3215P and 3315P are equal to 14.36 and 25.34 days respectively. They were found in rain-water after thunderstorms [\cite=SEL70]. Production of the radiophosphorus by thunderstorms can be understood by the following way:

[formula]

[formula]

thresholds of these processes are equal to 1.710 and 0.240 MeV respectively. It is possible the precipitation of MeV electrons from the inner radiation belt [\cite=INAN] and enhancement the processes by lighting.

Neutron Production by Thunderstorms

Authors of paper [\cite=BRA4] concluded that neutron burst are associated with lighting. The total number of neutrons produced by one typical lighting discharge was estimated as 2.5 * 1010.

LENR Stimulated by Condensed Matter Discharge

Let us consider the discharge (breakdown, spark and arc) using the different electrode. There are the following processes:

1. The electrode is Ni. Orbital or external electron capture

[formula]

The threshold Q1 = 0.37766  keV of this reaction on Ni should be compared with the threshold Q = 0.7823 energy for electron capture by free protons: Q1 / Q2  ≈  2. Velocity of orbital electron capture can be enhanced by the discharge.

2.Orbital or external electron capture

[formula]

with emission of energy Q2 = 2.30408 MeV.

3. Double orbital or external electron capture

[formula]

with emission of energy Q3 = 1.92642

The proposed cooperative mechanism of LENR in this case can be proved extremely simple way: presence of radioactive 5827Co and enriched isotope of 5826Fe.

[formula] This mechanism can give the possibilities to get controlling way the necessary isotopes and excess heat for using.

Conclusion

We proposed a new mechanism of LENR: cooperative processes in whole system - nuclei+atoms+condensed matter can occur at smaller threshold then corresponding ones on free constituents. The cooperative processes can be induced and enhanced by low energy external fields. The excess heat is the emission of internal energy and transmutations at LENR are the result of redistribution inner energy of whole system.
