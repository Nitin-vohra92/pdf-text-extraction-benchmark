Introduction

Current indirect proofs of existence of the supersymmetry in the Standard model make the problem of calculation of quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories especially urgent. The supersymmetry essentially improves the ultraviolet behavior of a theory. Thanks to that it is possible to suggest the form of the β-function exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory even in theories with unextended supersymmetry. The form of the exact β-function was proposed first in Ref. [\cite=NSVZ_Instanton] from the investigation of the instanton contributions structure. For N = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics, which will be considered in this paper, this β-function (that is called the exact Novikov, Shifman, Vainshtein and Zakharov (NSVZ) β-function) is

[formula]

where γ(α) is the anomalous dimension of the matter superfield.

Explicit calculations, made with the dimensional reduction [\cite=Siegel], confirm this proposal, but require a special choice of the subtraction scheme [\cite=Tarasov] [\cite=North]. Explicit calculations in two- [\cite=hep] [\cite=tmf2], three- [\cite=ThreeLoop] and partially four-loop [\cite=Pimenov] approximations for the N = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics with the higher derivative regularization [\cite=Slavnov] [\cite=Bakeyev] reveal that renormalization of the operator WaCabWb is exhausted at the one-loop and the Gell-Mann-Low function coincides with the exact NSVZ β-function and has corrections in all orders of the perturbation theory.

(In the supersymmetric electrodynamics the Gell-Mann-Low β-function is defined as follows: If terms, quadratic in the superfield V, in the renormalized effective action in the zero mass limit has the form

[formula]

where ∂2Π1 / 2 is a supersymmetric transversal projector, the Gell-Mann-Low function is defined by

[formula]

Nevertheless, the investigation of the supersymmetric electrodynamics was so far restricted by the three-loop approximation. It would be interesting to find out if it is possible to make explicit calculations exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory. As it was shown in Ref. [\cite=SD], a large number of Feynman diagrams can be calculated exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Ward identities. Nevertheless, some diagrams were not found by this way. A special proposal about the structure of the remaining contributions was made in Ref. [\cite=SD]. It assumes the existence of an identity, which is not reduced to Ward identities and can be graphically written as equality to 0 of the diagram, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Undefined_Diagram], where the notation (I1)a is explained below in the paper. (In the analytic form this identity is given by Eq. ([\ref=New_Identity])). This identity is nontrivial for non-planar diagrams starting from the three-loop approximation. In this paper we try to find a way to prove it exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory.

We consider the massless theory and a sufficiently large class of Feynman diagrams, which have the only loop of the matter superfields and remain connected after any two cuts of this loop. (Such a choice is made because in this case the technique of calculations is simpler.) For these diagrams the identity, pointed above, is completely proved in this paper. The proposed method of the proof seems can be used in the general case, but with some more technical difficulties.

The paper is organized as follows:

In Sec. [\ref=Section_SUSY_QED] the basic information about N = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics and its regularization by higher derivatives is reminded. The Schwinger-Dyson equations for the considered theory, constructed in Ref. [\cite=SD], are presented in Sec. [\ref=Section_SD]. Calculation of contributions to the two-point Green function of the gauge field, which can not be defined from the Ward identities, is made in Sec. [\ref=Section_Green]. (Such contributions of diagrams of the considered class are proved here to be 0 in the massless case.) In Sec. [\ref=Section_Anomaly_Puzzle] the two-point Green function of the gauge field is constructed on the basis of the obtained results. Divergences in it are shown to exist only in the one-loop approximation, while the Gell-Mann-Low function coincides with the exact NSVZ β-function. The obtained results are discussed in the Conclusion.

N = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics and its regularization by higher derivatives

The massless N = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics with the higher derivatives term in the superspace is described by the following action:

[formula]

Here φ and φ̃ are the chiral matter superfields and V is a real scalar superfield, which contains the gauge field Aμ as a component. The superfield Wa is a supersymmetric analog of the stress tensor of the gauge field. In the Abelian case it is defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a supersymmetric covariant derivative. It is important to note, that in the Abelian case the superfield Wa is gauge invariant, so that action ([\ref=Regularized_SQED_Action]) will be also gauge invariant.

Quantization of model ([\ref=Regularized_SQED_Action]) can be made by the standard way. For this purpose it is convenient to use the supergraphs technique, described in book [\cite=West] in details, and to fix the gauge invariance by adding the following terms:

[formula]

where

[formula]

After adding such terms a part of the action, quadratic in the superfield V, will have the simplest form

[formula]

In the Abelian case, considered here, diagrams, containing ghost loops are absent.

It is well known, that adding of the higher derivative term does not remove divergences in one-loop diagrams. In order to regularize them, it is necessary to insert in the generating functional the Pauli-Villars determinants [\cite=Slavnov_Book].

Due to the supersymmetric gauge invariance the renormalized action can be presented as

[formula]

Therefore, the generating functional can be written as

[formula]

where the renormalized action Sren is given by Eq. ([\ref=Renormalized_Action]), the gauge fixing action - by Eq. ([\ref=Gauge_Fixing]) (It is convenient to substitute e by e0 in Eq. ([\ref=Gauge_Fixing]), that we will assume below), the Pauli-Villars determinants are defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the coefficients ci satisfy conditions

[formula]

Below we will assume, that Mi  =  aiΛ, where ai are some constants. Insertion of Pauli-Villars determinants allows to cancel remaining divergences in all one-loop diagrams, including diagrams, containing insertions of counterterms.

The terms with sources are written in the form

[formula]

Moreover, in generating functional ([\ref=Modified_Z]) we introduced the expression

[formula]

where φ0, φ*0, φ̃0 and φ̃*0 are scalar superfields. They are some parameters, which are not chiral or antichiral. In principle, it is not necessary to introduce the term Sφ0 into the generating functional, but the presence of the parameters φ0 is highly desirable for the investigation of Schwinger-Dyson equations.

In our notations the generating functional for the connected Green functions is written as

[formula]

and an effective action is obtained by making a Legendre transformation:

[formula]

where the sources J, j and [formula] is to be eliminated in terms of the fields V, φ and φ̃, through solving equations

[formula]

Schwinger-Dyson equation

Following Ref. [\cite=SD], for convenience we first set the renormalization constant Z equal to 1. The dependence of the effective action on Z will be restored in the final result.

From generating functional ([\ref=Modified_Z]) it is possible to obtain [\cite=SD] the Schwinger-Dyson equations, which can be graphically written as

[formula]

where Γ(2)V is a two-point Green function of the gauge field.

The double line denotes the exact propagator (Z = 1)

[formula]

in which the function G(q2) is defined by the two-point Green function as follows:

[formula]

where [formula], and the lower indexes denote points, in which considered expressions are taken.

The large circle denotes the effective vertex, which is written as [\cite=SD]

[formula]

due to the Ward identities. Here the strokes denote derivatives with respect to q2,

[formula]

is a supersymmetric transversal projector, and F(q2) is a function, which can not be defined from the Ward identities. Here

[formula]

Two adjacent circles are an effective vertex, consisting of 1PI diagrams, in which one of the external lines is attached to the very left edge. Such vertexes are given by [\cite=SD]

[formula]

in the case of one external V-line (the vertex in the first diagram of Eq. ([\ref=SD_Equation])) and

[formula]

in the case of two external V-lines (in the second diagram of Eq. ([\ref=SD_Equation])). Here f(q2) is one more function, which can not be found from the Ward identity. Note, that such form of the Ward identities solutions can be easily checked by the method, which is constructed below in this paper. We will not present here the corresponding calculations, because they are rather cumbersome.

Our purpose will be calculation of the expression

[formula]

where p denotes the external momentum. In order to do this, the expressions for the propagators and vertexes given above are substituted into the Schwinger-Dyson equations. As a result some expressions for diagrams in Eq. ([\ref=SD_Equation]) are obtained. The result [\cite=SD] is obtained exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory. However the second diagram produces terms, containing the function f, which can not be found from the Ward identities. (In the one-loop approximation this function is equal 0. It is nontrivial only at two loops.) The terms, containing the unknown function F, are completely cancelled.

Calculation of contributions, containing the unknown function f, is a main purpose of this paper. After simple transformations the expression for the second diagram in Eq. ([\ref=SD_Equation]) in the massless case can be written as

[formula]

Then using the identity

[formula]

and the explicit expression for the vertex function ([\ref=Vertex3]) we find that the sum of two diagrams in Eq. ([\ref=SD_Equation]) (the result of the calculation for the first diagram is given in Ref. [\cite=SD]) is

[formula]

The second term will be proportional to

[formula]

This means, that the second term in equation ([\ref=Gamma2V]) can not be found from the Ward identity. Taking into account that the variational derivative with respect to a chiral superfield φz contains 2z, we easily find that the contribution of this term can be graphically presented as a diagram, shown in Fig.[\ref=Figure_Undefined_Diagram]. Here the symbol (I1)a (the notations will be explained below) means, that it is necessary to make a substitution

[formula]

in the effective propagator. The next section of the paper is devoted to the partial calculation of this diagram.

Calculation of contributions, which can not be found from the Ward identities

Let us consider a class of Feynman diagrams, which corresponds to the effective diagram, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Undefined_Diagram]. It has only one loop of the matter superfields and the diagram can not be made disconnected cutting two propagators in this loop. For example, the first diagram in Fig.[\ref=Figure_Examples] belongs to the considered class, while the second one does not. Then for diagrams of the considered type we calculate a contribution to the effective diagram, presented in Fig.[\ref=Figure_Undefined_Diagram].

For this purpose let us first consider subdiagrams, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Subdiagrams1]. (In our notations if qμ is an incoming momentum, then ∂μ  =   - iqμ.) Their contribution is written as

[formula]

In the limit p  →  0 in the momentum representation this expression can be equivalently rewritten as

[formula]

where the anticommuting relations for the covariant derivatives were used. This can be graphically interpreted as follows: Diagrams in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Subdiagrams1] in the limit p  →  0 are equivalent to the sum of diagrams, in which the external line is attached to point 2 and corresponds to the expressions [formula], while the line, connecting points 1 and 2, gives the contribution [formula] respectively.

Because the considered diagram, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Undefined_Diagram], already contains an external line with DaV, the terms, which contain only the first degrees of Da will be essential for us. (The other terms are 0 in the limit pμ  →  0.) These terms are evidently the ones containing DaV2 and γμγ5DV2.

Moreover, we need some identities, which allow to carry the external line from one vertex to another through a propagator. In order to make the formulas not too large, it is convenient to use the following notations:

[formula]

Then, for example, if X is an even element of the Grassmann algebra

[formula]

(Let us remind, that X1 denotes, that the field X is taken in point 1, and X2 - in point 2.) Other similar identities can be easily found.

The idea of Feynman diagrams summation is that we first use identity ([\ref=Identity1]) and in all diagrams remove vertexes, with one attached external line of the field V, but with no attached internal V-lines. After this we carry one of the external lines of the superfield V around the loop of the matter superfields until the point, to which the other external line is attached, by using identity ([\ref=Transfer_Identities]) and other similar identities. As a simple exercise to application of this method it is possible to verify Eqs. ([\ref=Vertex2]) and ([\ref=Vertex3]), which are the solutions of the Ward identities (in this case there are no limitations to the form of diagrams), and also to obtain explicit expressions for the unknown functions f and F as some sums of diagrams. Due to the lack of place we will not present the detailed solution of this problem. We will apply the described method directly to the calculation of the diagram, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Undefined_Diagram].

First we use identity ([\ref=Identity1]) and remove vertexes, with one attached external line of the field V, but with no attached internal V-lines. The result can be graphically presented as a sum of two diagrams, shown in Fig. [\ref=Figure_X]. (All other diagrams give zero result in the limit p  →  0.) In Fig. [\ref=Figure_X] and in the subsequent figures the hatched circle denotes a set of all internal lines of a diagram. External lines are attached only to points, with at least one more attached V-line. Bold lines in the figure denote propagators, in which (I0) is changed by (I1)a e t.c. In two considered diagrams such propagators are attached directly to the external lines.

To perform the further calculations it is convenient to use the following notations for the Feynman diagrams:

Let us consider a loop of the matter superfield and a fixed point on it. Let us go around this loop in some direction (for example, clockwise) and look, what expressions are encountered in places, where the propagators of the matter superfields were originally.

If a sequence of ordinary propagators

[formula]

is encountered, we will denote it by the symbol *  . However other expressions can be encountered in some places, e.f., (I1)a / q2 - (I4) / q2. In this case we write the corresponding (I) in the expression for the diagram, omitting a factor 1 / q2 for brevity. The momentum of the considered propagator we will always denote by q (it is not a loop momentum). If an expression like

[formula]

is encountered we again multiply it by q2 and write the result as qμ / q2(I0). At last, if an external line is encountered, we will write an expression, corresponding to this external line. In this way we pass around the loop until the starting point.

Thus to any Feynman diagram we set to the correspondence a special symbol. We will assume summation over all diagrams with the same symbol. For example, the expression [formula] denotes the sum of all diagrams, which have a structure, corresponding to the diagram in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Diagram_Identity12]. It is worth noting, that there are no limitations to possible positions of the insertions (I) for the diagrams of the considered class, while for all other diagrams positions of some insertions are not in general completely arbitrary.

For calculation of diagrams in Fig.[\ref=Figure_X] by identities, similar to ([\ref=Transfer_Identities]), in both diagrams we carry the right external line clockwise until a point to which the left external line is attached. It is easy to see, that only the terms

[formula]

are not finally equal to 0 in the limit pμ  →  0. (In this case such sequence of writing is chosen: from the point to which the right external line is attached, clockwise.)

In order to prove, that expression ([\ref=Considered_Terms]) is 0, we need some identities, which can be found from the consideration of diagrams, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Diagram_Identity12] - [\ref=Figure_Diagram_Identity5].

As an example we investigate a diagram, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Diagram_Identity12]. The expression for it we will denote Fμ(p) for the definiteness. We will calculate this expression by two ways: carrying in the considered diagram a right external line around the loop of the matter superfield clockwise and counter-clockwise until a point, to which another external line is attached. In the obtained expressions we will keep only terms of the first order in p. Such terms are produced, first, from expansions of the propagators momentums, and, second, from action of the operators D and [formula] to external lines. The result of the described procedure is two expressions for

[formula]

from which it is easy to construct two different expressions for ∂Fμ  /  ∂pμ|p = 0. Equating them we obtain the identity

[formula]

Similar consideration of diagrams, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Diagram_Identity3] , gives the identity

[formula]

where we took into account, that due to symmetry properties of the sum of Feynman diagrams

[formula]

Comparing Eqs. ([\ref=Equality2]) and ([\ref=Equality3]), we find

[formula]

Finally, one more identity is obtained from the diagram, presented in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Diagram_Identity5] in the limit p  →  0 after carrying the line with D2V around the loop. The original diagram is evidently 0, but the carrying of the line gives terms, proportional to V∂2Π1 / 2V. Their sum should be 0. Calculating these terms, we come to the equality

[formula]

From identities ([\ref=Equality3]), ([\ref=Identity]) and ([\ref=Identity5]) we find

[formula]

Comparing this equality with expression ([\ref=Considered_Terms]), we find, that the sum of the considered diagrams will be proportional to

[formula]

(All other terms are cancelled due to the symmetries of the sum of Feynman diagrams.)

It is easy to see, that for the diagrams of the considered class this expression is 0. Really, due to the identity

[formula]

an external line can be carried through a propagator of the field V. It is easy to see, that in any diagram of the considered class there is a pass (which includes carrying over photon lines), which allows to carry an external line so that the passing sequence of internal lines with (I1)a and (Ī1)b would be opposite to the original one. Then the diagram with replaced (Ī1)b and (I1)a is effectively obtained. For example, in Fig. [\ref=Figure_Passes] the original diagram corresponds to the sequence 1  →  2  →  3  →  4  →  1, while the pass 1  →  2  →  4  →  1  →  3  →  4  →  2  →  3  →  1 is also possible. Therefore, expression ([\ref=Last_Expression]) in the considered class of diagrams is 0 after summing all diagrams.

Thus the result of the above calculations for diagrams of the considered class can be presented as the identity

[formula]

where the function f was defined by Eq. ([\ref=Vertex3]), and the function G - by Eq. ([\ref=Explicit_Green_Functions]). Note, that the explicit three- [\cite=ThreeLoop] and four-loop [\cite=Pimenov] calculations show, that identity ([\ref=New_Identity]) is valid for arbitrary diagrams, but their consideration appears to be a bit more complicated. Note, that this identity is not a consequence of the Ward identities. It is found by explicit summation of Feynman diagrams.

Let us write the quantum corrections to the effective action, corresponding to the two-point Green function of the gauge field, in the form

[formula]

where d0 is some function (the index 0 of the function d means, that Z = 1 so far). Then taking into account results of Ref. [\cite=SD] (see also Eq. ([\ref=Gamma2V])) from the obtained identity we find

[formula]

where (PV) denotes a contribution of the Pauli-Villars fields. Thus, the proposal, made in [\cite=SD], has been proved in the massless case for diagrams of the considered type. For the Pauli-Villars fields the similar proposal is

[formula]

where the functions GPV and JPV are defined by the two-point Green functions for the Pauli-Villars fields. The proof of this proposal requires similar summation of diagrams in the massive case, which is essentially more complicated technically. However, the results of explicit three-loop calculations confirm this statement and we hope to give its general proof in future papers.

Two-point Green function of the gauge field.

Let us analyze consequences of Eqs. ([\ref=Proposal]) and ([\ref=PV_Proposal]). Due to the identity, partially proven in this paper, the integrals, defining the two-point Green function of the gauge field, are reduced to integrals of total derivatives in the four-dimensional spherical coordinates:

[formula]

Performing the differentiation it is also necessary to take into account the dependence of α0 on Λ. More detailed explanation of this result is given in Ref. [\cite=SD]. Existence of the considered limit for finite Λ is also proved in Ref. [\cite=SD]. Therefore, as a consequence of the Eq. ([\ref=Limit]) we find

[formula]

Let us now restore the dependence of the effective action on the renormalization constant Z. It is easy to see from the Feynman rules, that for this purpose it is sufficient to make a substitution Mi  →  Mi / Z in contributions of Pauli-Villars fields. Then from Eq. ([\ref=PV_Proposal]) we easily find

[formula]

where the function d is defined exactly as d0, but the dependence of the effective action on Z should be taken into account. The expression ZG is finite according to the definition of the renormalization constant Z. Therefore, in order to make this expression finite, it is necessary to cancel only the one-loop divergence. For this purpose the renormalization constant Z3 should be chosen so that

[formula]

where μ is a normalization point. Therefore the final expression for the effective action (without the gauge fixing terms) in the massless case can be written as

[formula]

According to this formula the Gell-Mann-Low function, defined by Eq. ([\ref=GL_Function]), is written as

[formula]

has corrections in all orders of the perturbation theory and coincides with the exact NSVZ β-function.

Note, that with the higher derivative regularization the scheme, in which the exact NSVZ β-function is obtained, is defined as follows: The renormalization of the operator WaCabWb is made without adding finite counterterms in two- and more loops. (There are no divergencies in the corresponding Green function in that loops.) Finite counterterms, which can be added for the renormalization of the two-point Green function of the matter superfield, can be arbitrary.

Conclusion

Summation of Feynman diagrams, defining the two-point Green function of the gauge field in the limit p  →  0 in the massless N = 1 supersymmetric electrodynamics, is partially made by Schwinger-Dyson equations and Ward identities. Diagrams, which can not be summed by this way, are non-planar and give a nontrivial contribution starting from the three-loop approximation. Calculation of their sum exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory appears to be rather complicated technically and was performed in this paper for a certain (sufficiently large) class of diagrams. This class of diagrams is chosen because for it the technique of calculations is simpler. The other diagrams probably can be investigated similarly. It is most important, that there is a summation algorithm, constructed in this paper.

Note, that the result of diagrams summation, which is expressed by Eq. ([\ref=New_Identity]) and can be easily guessed from explicit calculations, is a new identity, which is not reduced to the Ward identities. The results of this paper and Ref. [\cite=SD] show, that this identity is closely connected with relation ([\ref=Effective_Action]) for the two-point Green functions, from which the exact NSVZ β-function is obtained. Then there are some questions: What is a true reason of this identity? Is it a consequence of some symmetry of the theory? Can the obtained identity together with relation for the Green functions ([\ref=Effective_Action]) be included in a set of identities? So far we have no answers to these questions.

Moreover, there are some purely technical problems: It is a proof of identity ([\ref=New_Identity]) for diagrams, which were not considered in this paper, and of the similar identity in the massive case (and in particular for diagrams with the Pauli-Villars fields). The existence of such identity can be rather confidently suggested from the explicit calculations. Certainly, it would be also desirable to formulate all the results in terms of the generating functional, but so far we did not manage to do this.

The results, obtained by summation of the perturbation theory series, means, that Gell-Mann-Low function ([\ref=GL_Function]) coincides with the exact NSVZ β-function. (The renormalization of the operator WaCabWb is exhausted at the one-loop.)

Also it would be interesting to perform the similar investigation for the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, using higher covariant derivative regularization or simpler similar noninvariant regularization. In the latter case it is necessary to use a special subtraction scheme, which allows to restore the gauge invariance [\cite=Slavnov1] [\cite=Slavnov2]. Such scheme was proposed in Ref. [\cite=SlavnovStepan1] for Abelian supersymmetric theories and in Ref. [\cite=SlavnovStepan2] for the non-Abelian theories.
