COMMENT ON PLAGA'S ANALYSIS OF NEUTRINO SCATTERING CHARM II DATA

Recently Plaga [\cite=Plaga] claimed that the existence of a vector coupling of neutrinos in neutral currents, observed in the Charm II collaboration [\cite=Charm], led to the conclusion that neutrinos were Dirac particles. Although he successfully defended [\cite=Plaga] [\cite=Kayser] some of his assertions, his claim that Charm II data inevitably required Dirac neutrinos is not necessarily correct.

Namely, Charm II data are fitted with the Standard Model, thus supposing no flavour mixing of leptons. Solar and atmospheric- neutrino, as well as LSND neutrino [\cite=LSND] measurements suggest the existence of neutrino flavour mixing. One should fit the Charm II data including also the charged-current contribution in the electron- μ-neutrino scattering. Following 't Hooft [\cite=tHooft], one can immediately find the effective couplings for Dirac neutrinos:

[formula]

Similarly, one can study the scattering with Majorana neutrinos. Neglecting the mass terms, the cross sections of the (e,μ)- neutrino-electron scattering [\cite=tHooft]

[formula]

should be used to fit the Charm II data. Since [formula], the impact of the neutrino mixing with the same magnitude |Ueμ|2  =  O(10- 2) to the fit of the effective couplings could be considerable. Notice that the first results of NOMAD[\cite=NOMAD] do not exclude smaller neutrino masses (less than 1 eV) and larger mixing in the LSND plot [\cite=LSND].

To conclude, one can say that it is premature to draw a conclusion concerning the Dirac or Majorana nature of the neutrino until there is no electroweak theory (that can explain small neutrino masses and flavour mixing in a natural way) to fit all the existing data.
