CONSTRAINTS ON THE CHARGED HIGGS SECTOR FROM THE CDF TOP QUARK DATA

The discovery of the top quark at the Tevatron Collider has led to a good deal of interest in the search for new particles in top quark decay1]. In particular the top quark decay is known to be a promising place to look for the charged Higgs boson2], occurring in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. The MSSM contains two Higgs doublets of opposite hypercharge; and the ratio of their vacuum expectation values defines the parameter

[formula]

The 2 complex doublets correspond to 8 independent states, 3 of which are eaten up by the W± and Z0 bosons. This leaves 5 physical states -- the 3 neutral scalars H01,H02,A0 along with the charged pair

[formula]

In the diagonal KM matrix approximation, the H± couplings to the important quark and leptonic channels are given by

[formula]

from which one can calculate the branching ratios B(t  →  bH+) and B(H+  →  τν). The leading log QCD correction is taken into account by substituting the quark mass terms in (3) by their running masses3]

[formula]

Fig. 1 shows the resulting branching ratios B(t  →  bH+) and B(H+  →  τ+ν) against tan β as solid and dashed lines respectively for a representative H± mass of 100 GeV. The former is peaked at small (≤  1) and large (≥  mt / mb) values of tan β, while the latter reaches its maximal value of 1 for tan β  ≥  2. It is the product of these two branching ratios that determines the size of the effective H± signal. Thus one expects a viable signal in the region of large tan β(  ≥  40).

The top quark pair are produced via quark-antiquark or gluon-gluon fusion and decay via the W± or H± bosons. While H  →  τν decay has a branching ratio ~  1 for tan β  ≥  2, the branching ratios for W decays are

[formula]

Requiring leptonic (e or μ) decay of one W boson for a viable signal leads to the following final states,

[formula]

Thus for the SM decay via W, the t signal occurs in the (I) [formula] + multi-jet and (II) [formula] channels with relative probabilities of 24/81 and 4/81 respectively. However in the presence of the t  →  bH decay, the latter channel has a sizeable additional contribution with a relative probability of 4/9 times B(t  →  bH) / B(t  →  bW). The [formula] + multi-jet channel (I) is the most significant channel for the t signal, where the CDF experiment has seen ~   26 signal events using SVX b-tagging1]. Using this for normalisation, one can predict the number of t events in the [formula] channel (II) provided one knows the relative detection efficiencies for the two channels.

We have made a Monte Carlo estimate of the detection efficiencies for the (I) [formula] + multi-jet channel with SVX b-tagging and (II) [formula] channel with hadronic decay of τ, incorporating the CDF cuts and identification efficiencies in each case1,4]. We get5]

[formula]

The last number corresponds to a H± mass of 100 GeV, but rather insensitive to this parameter. The larger efficiency for the WH compared to the WW contribution in the [formula] channel is mainly due to the opposite polarization of τ in the two cases5,6].

Fig. 2 shows the predicted t signal cross-section in the [formula] channel against tan β for different H± masses5]. The right scale shows the corresponding number of events for the CDF integrated luminosity of 110 pb- 11]. While one expcects only ~  1.5 events from the WW contribution, there can be a large contribution from WH at [formula]. The CDF experiment has reported 4 events against a non-top background of 2  ±  .351,4]. the corresponding 95% C.L. limit of 7.7 events is indicated by the dashed line. It implies a lower limit of MH±  >  100 ~ GeV for tan β  >  40.

Fig. 3 shows the 95% CL limit on H± mass against tan β5]. The right scale shows the corresponding limit on the A0 mass. Thus the CDF data seems to rule out a light pseudoscalar (MA0  <  60 ~ GeV) for tan β  ≥  40 ~ GeV, which was required for the so called large tan β solution to the (so called!) Rb anomaly7].

The above limit is significantly stronger than the one recently obtained by the CDF collaboration on the basis of their inclusive τ-channel data8]. However, the difference can be largely traced to the different normalisation method adopted there8]. They use the SM cross-section for σ(t) for normalisation, instead of the experimental cross section for σ(t  →  bWW), as measured via their [formula] + multijet events. We feel that the normalisation method based on the latter is less model dependent and more powerful at large tan β.
