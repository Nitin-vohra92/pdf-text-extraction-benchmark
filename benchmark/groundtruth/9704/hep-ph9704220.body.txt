Preliminary remarks.

A discovery of the Higgs boson is one of the main goals for the next generation of colliders.

If the Higgs boson mass MH is larger than 2MZ, it can be discovered at LHC, photon colliders [\cite=GKST] or e+e- linear colliders [\cite=SLACDESY] via the sizable decay mode H  →  ZZ. For all types of collisions a background to this decay mode is rather small. If MH < 145 GeV the Higgs boson can be discovered at e+e- linear colliders or photon colliders via the dominant decay mode H  →  b and at LHC - via the decay mode H  →  γγ.

The mass range MH = 140 - 190 GeV is the most difficult one for the Higgs boson discovery. In this mass range the decay mode H  →  W+W- with real or virtual W's (W*  →  q,e,...) is dominant, branching ratios of other decay modes decrease rapidly and their using for the Higgs boson discovery is very difficult. The use of the H  →  W+W- decay at e+e- collider is also difficult due to a strong nonresonant W+W- background. (See review [\cite=Gun2] and references therein for more details). As for observation of such Higgs boson at photon collider, it was noted that "the WW final state will be a difficult one to use for doing Higgs physics" [\cite=BBC]. The opportunity to see Higgs boson with MH  ~  2MW via WW mode at photon collider was noted in ref. [\cite=Gun1], where nonrealistic photon spectrum was used and the interference effects were neglected.

In this letter, we show that the Higgs boson with the mass MH = 140 - 190 GeV can be discovered at the photon collider via the H  →  W+W- decay mode.

To this end we consider both resonant γγ  →  H  →  W+W- and nonresonant QED contributions into this process:

[formula]

Here |M0|2 stands for the background QED process γγ  →  W+W-, |MH|2 is the contribution of γγ  →  H  →  W+W- and 2Re(M0 *MH) describes the interference effect of these two mechanism.

The interference contribution is negligible both at high enough masses of Higgs [\cite=GKPS] and far below the nominal threshold (at MWW < 2MW). The interference was neglected in calculations of [\cite=Gun1] for entire mass region. In fact, for MH = 200 - 300 GeV the interference appeared to be not small [\cite=MTZ]. Its magnitude increases with decrease in MH. The range of MWW where the deviation from the nonresonant background is noticeable, coincides with the Higgs boson width ΓH, therefore this range also decreases with decrease in MH. After averaging over a reasonable interval of MWW the effect was still noticeable providing an additional way to study the Higgs boson coupling with W bosons [\cite=MTZ].

We use these considerations as a starting point following a proposal [\cite=Gin96].

The WW production cross section at 140 < MWW < 190 GeV.

We consider initial photon state with total helicity zero (helicities of colliding photons λ1  =  λ2  =    ±  1). Only a photon state with such quantum numbers can produce the Higgs boson. Helicity amplitudes for the nonresonant process (in the Born approximation) for such initial state are presented in ref. [\cite=BB]. In this case the helicities λ of produced W bosons coincide. One has (the subscript corresponds to helicity of produced W, Λ is the product of the photon and W helicities):

[formula]

The amplitude MH is written in the standard form via the well known amplitude of Higgs boson two photon decay [\cite=vain].

In practice we deal with the production of four fermions in the final state produced via intermediate W boson state. The distribution in invariant masses for such final state has a maximum at MW with the width ΓW and long tails away from the maximum. It can be described by the well known Breit-Wigner spectral density for the W boson. One can view this as the production of W* -- a virtual W boson with the mass not equal to MW. Because of this, the cross section does not vanish below the nominal threshold MthrWW = 2MW. The most important effect comes from the corresponding modification in the final phase space [\cite=GKPS]. It can be described via replacement of the relative velocity of W bosons in the center of mass frame

[formula]

by its convolution with above spectral density for the W boson ϱ(M2):

[formula]

Close to the threshold the γγ  →  W+W- cross section for stable W bosons can be approximated as:

[formula]

We do not have explicit formulas for the background process below the threshold. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to the approximation where helicity amplitudes are calculated at the nominal threshold 2MW neglecting the effect of the finite width. Finally, we approximate cross section near the threshold by equation

[formula]

The accuracy of this approximation can be checked by comparing exact calculation for the Higgs boson width ΓprecH  →  W+W- (based on ref. [\cite=Hwid]) with our approximation. Let us denote the Higgs boson width obtained in the framework of our approximation as ΓphasH  →  W+W-. We find then that the ratio ΓprecH  →  W+W-  /  ΓphasH  →  W+W- varies from 1.2 for MH = 160 GeV to 1.6 for MH = 140 GeV. Note, that the Higgs boson width itself decreases by a factor of 20 for MH  =  140 GeV in comparison with its value at MH = 160 GeV, so one can conclude that our approximation works well.

Let us now describe the results of the calculation. In our estimates we neglected angular dependence of the cross sections (since we are working in the threshold region) and integrated over production angle in the center of mass frame within the range [formula]. This represents 94% of the total solid angle.

In Fig. 1 we show γγ  →  W+W- cross section for various MH as a function of the invariant mass MWW of the W+W- pair for the initial state with total helicity zero. For MH  ≥  180 GeV the two-peak behavior observed in [\cite=MTZ] is seen clearly. The interference term in eq. ([\ref=ampl]) is large for such Higgs boson masses. The height of the peak grows with decrease in MH but its width (≈  ΓH) becomes smaller and smaller.

With subsequent decrease in MH, the background QED process is suppressed by the phase space and the interference also becomes small in comparison with the Higgs boson contribution.

The "experimental" cross sections.

After averaging over initial energy distribution of the photons, the Higgs boson signal decreases and seems to be hardly observable. To circumvent this problem, the observation of W bosons in the final state is mandatory (perhaps, via quark jets). In order to account for a finite resolution in MWW, we consider a "smeared" cross section, similar to [\cite=MTZ]:

[formula]

The results for d = 5 GeV are presented below.

Let us stress that we do not perform any convolution with initial photon spectra. It is because of the fact that the real form of these effective spectra strongly depends on the details of the conversion design. Note also, that it can not be obtained by a simple convolution of individual spectra [\cite=GKST]. Real energy distribution of colliding photons should be measured for every energy of collider. We have in mind "monochromatic" variant of the photon collider with the effective width of the γγ energy distribution ~  15 % [\cite=GKST] [\cite=SLACDESY].

The results of this calculation are shown in Fig. 2 (above the nominal threshold), in Fig. 3 (below the nominal threshold) and in the Table.

In view of a very high degree of photon polarization expected at photon colliders, we present the Figures for completely polarized photon beams: <  λ1  >    =    <  λ2 >  =   ±  1. Higgs boson signal deteriorates when <  λ1 >  < λ2  >   decreases. Some result for <  λi  >    ≠  1 are presented in the Table for "realistic" mean helicities of the photons [\cite=GKST] [\cite=SLACDESY].

Above the nominal threshold the curves in Fig. 2 exhibit a characteristic shape. A deviation from the QED background is very sensitive to the presence of the Higgs boson. Therefore, such behavior of the experimental curve can be considered as an evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson in this mass region. Here the background QED cross section varies from 3.6 pb for MWW = 160 GeV to 30 pb for MWW = 190 GeV. The Higgs boson production cross section adds another 3 pb for MH = 160 GeV (87%). For MH = 190 GeV an interference term in eq. ([\ref=ampl] delivers 1.8 pb (6%) to the total cross section.

Below the threshold Higgs boson is observed even more clearly (Fig. 3). The total cross section is about 1 pb in the whole region. It is larger than the cross section for the background process by almost a factor of 2 for MH = 160 GeV and by a factor of 9 for MH = 140 GeV. This result is in qualitative agreement with that in ref. [\cite=Gun1].

This behavior is not surprising. The total Higgs boson production cross section averaged over the range of MWW larger than the total width of the Higgs boson is equal to σγγ  →  H  =  4π2Γγγ  /  M3H. The Higgs boson width drops out in this result. Roughly speaking, the cross section is almost independent of MH in the considered mass range. At the same time, down to MH  =  145 GeV the W+W- decay mode still remains dominant. On the other hand, the QED background decreases fast with decrease in MWW in the considered mass range. For this reason the two peak behavior, observed for MH > 180 GeV, changes to a single resonance peak near and below the threshold and the Higgs boson signal becomes dominant in this region.

As was discussed above, more precise calculation of the Higgs boson width would enhance the effect by a factor ~  1.6 for MH = 140 GeV. We expect that the signal-to-background ratio will be close to the one calculated in this paper.

Discussion. Final remarks.

We conclude that the Higgs boson with the mass MH = 140 - 190 GeV can be observed and studied in the process γγ  →  W+W- at future γγ colliders by measuring the invariant mass of produced W+W- system with reasonable resolution. A luminosity integral required for this observation is ~  1 fb- 1. This value seems to be sufficient even accounting for corrections due to detection efficiency etc., and the electromagnetic 4 jet production.

Moreover, we found that for MH  ≤  160 GeV the effect of the Higgs boson is still seen after being smeared over 15 GeV. This means that the signal of the Higgs boson lighter than 160 GeV can be observed even in the total γγ  →  W+W- cross section without restrictions on the W+W- invariant mass.

Additionally, if the Higgs boson mass is near 140 GeV, one can hope to observe Higgs boson decays into b and W+W-. It provides an opportunity to compare the Higgs boson coupling to quarks and to gauge bosons and in this way to test the Higgs boson origin of particle masses.

Last, similar calculation can be easily repeated for γγ  →  H  →  ZZ process below its nominal threshold (the nonresonant background is negligible here). The corresponding cross sections are ~  50 fb. Therefore, provided the luminosity integral ~   10 fb- 1, one can also observe a Higgs boson in ZZ decay mode in the whole region of MH considered here. The comparison of Higgs boson couplings with different gauge bosons will be essential test of SM concerning Higgs mechanism of the mass origin.

Our analyses at this point should be considered as an estimate of the effect. We are sure that our estimates give correct order of magnitude prediction for the signal to background ratio. However, more studies are required to arrive at absolute predictions. At the first stage of such studies Born approximations for all quantities should be improved by taking into account relatively large corrections due to the finite W width in γγ  →  H amplitude [\cite=MelYak].
