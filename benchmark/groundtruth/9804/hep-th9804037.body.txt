Understanding the dynamics of SU(N) gauge theories in 4 dimensions in the large N limit has been an outstanding problem during the last few decades. It was first pointed out by 't Hooft [\cite=tH1] that when one fixes the value of the coupling constant λ = g2YMN, Feynman diagrams of perturbation theory organize themselves into Riemann surfaces and the amplitudes corresponding to higher genus Riemann surfaces are suppressed by powers of 1 / N. Thus the planar diagrams dominate in the large N limit. In ref.[\cite=tH2], the convergent nature of the planar perturbation series for each fixed value of the genus has been established (modulo the problem of renormalization). If we denote as fj(λ) the genus j amplitude of some physical quantity, the weak coupling perturbative series [formula] converges in a finite range |λ| < λc (the radius of convergence λc is believed to be universal for all j). fj(λ) will be regular on the positive real axis λ > 0 while it has a singularity at -  λc on the negative real axis.

We expect the functions [formula] to have analytic continuations into the strong coupling region |λ|  >  λc. In this regime they will possess convergent 1 / λ expansions of the form [formula].

Planar perturbation theory has been considered exclusively in the weak coupling regime |λ| < λc so far. Recently, however, interesting observations have been made on the relation between the supergravity/string theories in the space-time and the field theories defined on branes on its boundary [\cite=K] [\cite=GKT] [\cite=GK] [\cite=Mal1] (CFT/AdS correspondence). Under this correspondence the 4 dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is related to a supergravity theory on AdS5  ×  S5. If one denotes the radius of the space AdS5 / S5 as R and the string coupling and length as gst and [formula], respectively, the mapping is given by [\cite=Mal1]

[formula]

Thus the strong coupling region of gauge theory is mapped to the semi-classical regime of gravity where the size of the space-time is much larger than the string length [formula]. (On the other hand the weak coupling regime is mapped to a region of gravity/string theory where the space-time is much smaller than [formula].) In this context of particular interest is the possibility of a strongly coupled gauge system being described by a classical gravity theory in some particular background. In a recent work [\cite=W2] the thermodynamic properties of N = 4 Yang-Mills theories are derived using classical solutions in AdS space.

In order to have a better understanding of the CFT/AdS correspondence it is important to gain further insights to the strong coupling dynamics of large N gauge theories. In this paper we would like to analyze the strong coupling behavior of the large N gauge theory by making use of its S-duality. In the following we first consider a functional equation for the dependence of the coupling constant λ = g2YMN on some physical amplitude derived by imposing the invariance under S-duality gYM  ↔  1 / gYM. It is easy to find a consistent solution to the functional equation where the j-th non-planar amplitude fj(λ) has a behavior fj(λ)  ≈  λj for large λ. We then discuss our result in connection with the expected behavior of the supergravity/string theory amplitudes in AdS5 / S5 space.

According to our analysis the planar amplitude behaves as f0(λ)  ≈  const as λ  →    ∞  . This implies that the perturbative D-brane computation of thermodynamics of near extremal black hole at small λ = gstN may be smoothly extrapolated to the large-λ region of classical gravity. In particular the discrepancy of a factor 3/4 in the computation of the entropy of near extremal black 3-brane in [\cite=GKP] [\cite=KT] may be accounted for if f0(λ  =    ∞  ) = 3 / 4. Unfortunately, the S-duality does not have enough power to determine the functional form of f0(λ) explicitly.

Let us consider the large N expansion of some physical amplitude in N = 4 Yang-Mills theory,

[formula]

f0(λ) denotes the sum over amplitudes of planar Feynman diagrams. Its weak coupling expansion, [formula] is expected to have a finite radius of convergence λc around the origin in the complex λ plane [\cite=tH2]. Similarly fj(λ)(j  ≥  1) gives a sum over the amplitudes of diagrams with j handles. As is well-known these amplitudes are suppressed by N- 2j in the 1 / N expansion. Weak coupling expansion of fj has the same radius of convergence λc.

Let us assume that the above amplitude is invariant under the S-duality transformation gYM  →  1 / gYM. In terms of λ the transformation is given by λ  →  N2  /  λ. Hence

[formula]

(We may consider a more general case when the amplitude is a modular form with a certain weight. It is straightforward to modify the following discussions for these cases.)

Now let us determine the large λ behavior of functions fj(λ). We assume that the functions fj(λ) can be analytically continued to |λ| > λc and has a convergent expansion in 1 / λ. By comparing the both sides of the functional relation ([\ref=damp]) we find that the following Ansatz

[formula]

is consistent. By substituting ([\ref=fjst]) into the RHS of ([\ref=damp]) we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand the LHS becomes

[formula]

Hence the Ansatz is consistent if the coefficients [formula] are symmetric

[formula]

In terms of the original gauge coupling gYM the amplitude F is written as

[formula]

which is manifestly symmetric under gYM  ↔  1 / gYM due to the symmetry of the expansion coefficients eq.([\ref=symm]).

Symmetry of the coefficients [formula] also implies that the expansion coefficients of the planar amplitude

[formula]

determine the leading coefficients of the non-planar amplitudes fj(λ)  ≈  C0,jλj.

In the above we have considered the strong coupling region of the large N gauge theory where quantum Yang-Mills theory is expected to be "dual" to the semi-classical supergravity/string theory on AdS5  ×  S5. The precise mapping of the parameters between these theories is given by [\cite=Mal1]

[formula]

where [formula] is the 10-dimensional Planck length. Thus the large N limit corresponds to the limit of small curvature of the AdS5 / S5 space and the large λ corresponds to the suppression of string theoretic corrections.

In string theory the structure of the perturbative expansion in the presence of N coincident Dirichlet branes is given by

[formula]

where b counts the number of open-string loops attached to the D-branes and j counts the number of closed-string loops. Dj,b's are some numerical constants. Here the factor N appears due to Chan-Paton factors which distinguish different D-branes. Using gstN = λ one may rewrite the above expansion as

[formula]

This exactly reproduces the weak coupling planar perturbation series in gauge theory. Note that in this formula the double-lines representing a gluon in Yang-Mills theory are regarded as describing the motion of end points of an open string and hence b equals the number of index-loops in the standard large N counting. The sum over open-string loops converges in the weak coupling region |λ| < λc. According to our assumption the series may be continued to the strong coupling region and yields a 1 / λ expansion,

[formula]

Thus the S-duality symmetry [formula] of gauge theory corresponds to a dual relationship between the open-string and closed-string loop expansions in gravity/string theory.

It is well-known that the region of validity of the D-brane perturbation theory in the study of thermodynamic properties of black holes is where the size of the black hole is much smaller than the string length (for a review of D-brane approach to black hole physics, see, for instance [\cite=Mal2]). This corresponds to the weak coupling regime |λ| < λc in the present context. On the other hand in the region of validity of classical gravity the size of black hole must be much larger than the string length and hence |λ| > λc. The crossover range λ  ≈  λc corresponds to the matching point in the analysis of [\cite=HP]. In the case of the computation of the entropy of extreme black holes [\cite=SV] [\cite=CM] predictions of the D-brane perturbation theory can be smoothly continued to the large coupling region due to the topological nature of BPS states. On the other hand in the case of black holes away from the extremality the stability of the extrapolation is not guaranteed [\cite=Das]. Our result f0(λ)  ≈  const as λ  ≈    ∞  , however, seems to assure a smooth dependence on the coupling constant λ as far as the planar amplitudes are concerned. In particular the values of f0 at λ = 0 and ∞   could differ only by some numerical factor. The discrepancy by a factor 3/4 in the computation of entropy of near extremal black three-brane [\cite=GKP] [\cite=KT] may in fact be explained in terms of strong coupling effects of gauge theory.

According to recent papers [\cite=KS] [\cite=LNV] [\cite=BKV] [\cite=Ka] [\cite=BJ] planar amplitudes of 4-dimensional gauge theories with vanishing beta functions are identical irrespective of the numbers of supersymmetries N = 4,2,1. Hence our results f0(λ)  ≈  const at λ  ≈    ∞   would also hold in a large class of Yang-Mills theories with N = 2,1 supersymmetries. It will be extremely interesting if we could test this prediction.

We now rewrite the gauge theory amplitude F using the relation ([\ref=map2]),

[formula]

If one uses the 10-dimensional Newton constant GN

[formula]

F is further rewritten as

[formula]

The overall factor R8 / GN (proportional to N2) of ([\ref=sugra]) has a natural form from the point of view of classical gravity since R8 / GN is the unique dimensionless combination of the 10-dimensional Newton constant and the radius R of space-time. Open-string couplings to the D-branes are expanded in power series of [formula] and generate α' corrections in ([\ref=sugra]). The sum over the closed-string loops, on the other hand, are expanded in power series of [formula]. This factor is enhanced from the tree level classical value GN / R8 by [formula]. This enhancement may be interpreted as being due to ultra-violet divergences of classical gravity at quantum level being cured by string theory with an effective cut-off at [formula].
