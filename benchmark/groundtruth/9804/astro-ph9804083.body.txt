Topological Defects with Broken Scale Invariance

Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics

The traditional class of scale invariant defect models has severe problems[\cite=pst97]. They do not explain the rise in fluctuation amplitude at scales of a few degrees, and the slope of the perturbations is at conflict with the observed matter power spectrum. We show here that global topological defects are generically destroyed at the matter-radiation transition at a cosmic age of 100000 years. In this case, instead of being at great discrepancy with the cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuations, this model in fact correctly explains several hitherto mysterious phenomena. The most recent supernovae search[\cite=science] [\cite=perlmutter], concordance arguments[\cite=oststei] and direct angular diameter distance measurements[\cite=danos] have suggested that the universe is filled with a cosmological constant. Its existence is at best mysterious in most cosmological models. The new defect models, however, predict such a cosmological constant from the COBE observations.

Let us now address the decay of global defects at matter-radiation equality. In modern particle physics, all interactions which are not forbidden actually occur. On this ground, one generically expects couplings between gravity and other quantum fields which are stronger than just the space time curvature. Global fields experience couplings of the form [formula], where ε is a dimensionless coupling constant of order unity, and R is the scalar curvature. In the radiation epoch of the universe, R = 0, so the coupling has no dynamical effect. But when the universe enters matter domination, this coupling will generally destroy the exact symmetry which gave rise to the defects, and they will collapse coherently. During the onset of collapse, the vacuum energy contributed by the new coupling will boost the power on the largest scales, making the power spectrum more consistent with the observed excess of large scale power. Today there would be no defects remaining. At late times when the cosmological constant begins to dominate, fluctuations decay, thus inducing large scale CMB anisotropies. The COBE detection in this model would be solely due to relatively local, sub-horizon, fluctuations at the ca 100 Mpc scale, whose potential decays at late time through the influence of a cosmological constant. Since linear perturbations do not generate any late time anisotropies in a flat matter dominated universe, the COBE detection in fact predicts a cosmological constant. This is in contrast to inflationary models, where a cosmological constant is disfavoured by the COBE observations [\cite=bunn].

These defect models have two free parameters. One is the symmetry breaking scale φ0, and the second is its coupling to the Riemann scalar ε. From the velocity dispersion in clusters of galaxies we expect φ0 / mplanck  ~  v2 / c2  ~  10- 5, which would also be related to the COBE fluctuations. This energy scale suggests that the defect would be relicts of the breaking of the Grand-Unified-Theory in the early universe. A predictive property of this model is the non-Gaussianity of fluctuations. The strongest constraints arises from the statistics of rich clusters[\cite=chiu97]. Several clusters with temperatures above 12 keV have been found[\cite=donahue], and a recent cluster with a temperature of 17 keV[\cite=tucker97] has been discovered. The existence of these very hot clusters is becoming an enigma for any Gaussian cosmological model. In non-Gaussian defect models, one would expect a larger proportion of high temperature clusters relative to low temperature ones. The recent Las Campanas galaxy survey discovered features in the two dimensional galaxy power spectrum which is inconsistent with Gaussianity[\cite=landy]. Such signs of non-Gaussianity are generically predicted in these defect models.

In the defect scenario, the small scale CMB experiments MAP and Planck will not measure the multiple oscillations expected from adiabatic perturbations imprinted before the big bang, as predicted by inflation. Instead, the degree scale anisotropies are caused by the incoherent properties of global defects[\cite=pst97]. A sample angular power spectrum in such a scenario is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:cmb]. The effect of these broken defects is simulated using CMBFAST[\cite=sz] by truncating the primordial power at matter-radiation equality, which corresponds to the peak in the power. This prediction is heuristic, since decoherence, vector modes and other complications are only modelled in a simple fashion, but one would expect the qualitative results to remain similar. Without the oscillations, it will be very difficult to reconstruct cosmological parameters accurately. On the other hand, this would be an exciting measurement of fundamental physics and the history of symmetry breaking.
