Introduction

Superstring theories have infinitely degenerate supersymmetric vacua which are continuously connected by massless scalar fields, called moduli. These moduli fields are generally expected to acquire their masses [formula] of the order of the gravitino mass m3 / 2 once supersymmetry breaking effects are included. The moduli decay into two gravitinos if the masses of moduli are larger than 2m3 / 2.

In this paper, we consider the decay of the moduli into two gravitinos and discuss its cosmological consequences. It is known [\cite=Wei] [\cite=Kaw] that the gravitino with the mass 100GeV-1TeV decays soon after the nucleosynthesis and the decay product destroys light nuclei produced in the early universe. We see that the moduli decay tends to produce too many gravitinos to keep the success of big-bang nucleosynthesis. We derive stringent constraints on the moduli masses to avoid this disaster such as [formula].

We stress that this constraint is applicable to generic scalar fields that decay only through gravitationally suppressed interactions as long as their masses are larger than the threshold of two-gravitino decay channel.

The Interaction

We assume one modulus field throughout the paper, though the generalization to the case of many moduli is straightforward. We set the gravitational scale 2.4  ×  1018GeV equal to unity.

The relevant terms in the supergravity Lagrangian [\cite=Wes] which describe the decay of a modulus φ into gravitinos χ is given by

[formula]

where W denotes the superpotential and we choose the field φ so that its vacuum expectation value vanishes: 〈φ〉  =  0. With our definition of φ, the Kähler potential K generically contains linear terms, [formula], where the coefficient c is of order one.

The Decay

Let us begin by discussing the decay rate of the modulus. When [formula], the order of the decay width of φ into gravitinos is given by

[formula]

where c denotes the coefficient of the φ term in the Kähler potential. Here, we have used Eq.([\ref=LAG]), the gravitino equation of motion and 〈eK / 2W〉  =  m3 / 2.

On the other hand, the order of the decay width of φ into radiation is given by

[formula]

where N is the number of the decay channels. Hence the branching ratio of the decay into gravitinos turns out to be

[formula]

The modulus φ starts damped oscillation when the Hubble scale H becomes comparable to its mass [formula]. The initial amplitude of the coherent oscillation is expected to be of order one in the Planck unit. Then the modulus density [formula] dominates the universe at the decay time since [formula]. The reheat temperature after the modulus decay is given by

[formula]

where N* denotes the degrees of freedom at the temperature TR.

This implies that the gravitino number density n3 / 2 produced through the modulus decay at the decay time is given by

[formula]

where s denotes the entropy density and we have used

[formula]

Namely, the modulus mass is given by

[formula]

where y3 / 2  =  n3 / 2 / s.

Gravitinos are also produced by the scattering processes of the thermal radiations after the modulus decay. The contribution to the gravitino number density is given by [\cite=Kaw]

[formula]

The Bound

In the previous section, we have estimated y3 / 2  =  n3 / 2 / s at the decay time of the modulus φ. We may derive cosmological constraints on y3 / 2 from the observation of the present universe since the estimated value y3 / 2 itself yields the value of n3 / 2 / s at the time of the gravitino decay.

Stringent constraints are implemented to keep the successful predictions of the big-bang nucleosynthesis provided the gravitino with the mass 100GeV-1TeV mainly decays into a photon and a photino [\cite=Kaw]:

[formula]

By means of Eq.([\ref=MAS]), we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, the constraints due to gravitinos produced by the scattering processes of the thermal radiations read as follows:

[formula]

where we have used Eq.([\ref=THE]).

Conclusion

We have derived the constraint [formula] on the moduli masses [formula] in the case of the unstable gravitino with the mass 100GeV-1TeV. This may have obvious implications for mechanisms of the moduli stabilization. Here, the moduli may be regarded as generic scalar fields that decay only through gravitationally suppressed interactions as long as their masses are larger than the threshold of two-gravitino decay channel.

In the course of the analysis, we assumed that no entropy production has diluted the modulus and gravitino densities since the modulus density once dominated the universe. In fact, entropy production may evade the constraints. New inflation and thermal inflation are possible candidates of enough entropy production. Without such inflationary dilution, the moduli masses are severely constrained. On the other hand, if the moduli masses lie in the region [formula], the reheat temperature of the cosmological inflation could be very high since the density of gravitinos produced just after the inflation is diluted substantially by the decay of moduli.
