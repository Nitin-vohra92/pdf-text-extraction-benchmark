Abstract

We use multiscale-multispace correlations and Fourier transform techniques, to study some intermittent random field properties, which escape analysis by structure function scaling. These properties are parametrized in terms of a set of scale ratios, giving the typical interaction distances in space and scale of the random field fluctuations, and the characteristic lengths over which these fluctuations act coherently to generate intermittency. The relevance of these techniques in turbulence theory is discussed. PACS numbers: 47.27.Jv, 02.50.Ey, 05.45.+b, 47.27.Gs

Turbulence is usually depicted as a situation of irregular fluid motion, with energy being transferred from large to small scales, by interaction between eddies of increasingly smaller size. This mechanism of energy transfer, usually referred to with the name of cascade, takes different forms depending on the choice of turbulence description. In closure [\cite=lesieur], a Fourier representation of the Navier-Stokes equation is typically used. In this case, the transfer of energy between eddies is expressed in terms of an energy flux in wavevector space. This flux is a nonlinear kernel of the spectral energy density, and therefore a fully global quantity, carrying no information on spatial structure and transfer fluctuations. In intermittency modelling, instead, the description is necessarily local in space, at least implicitly. In the random beta model [\cite=benzi85], for example, this is obtained using a superposition of nested eddies of increasingly smaller size, with a fluctuating eddy to eddy energy transfer.

In both circumstances, the dynamics forces correlations between the fluctuations at different scale and space locations. Only recently, however, there has been some interest in studying correlations in turbulence [\cite=arneodo98], [\cite=benzi98], beyond the standard approach of focusing on structure function scaling.

A tool that is receiving great attention, especially in the study of intermittency, is synthetic turbulence [\cite=eggers91], [\cite=benzi93], [\cite=juneja94]. Synthetic turbulence has no pretense of modelling turbulence dynamics, its goal being more the one of reproducing the statistics observed in experimental turbulence data. Even so, the multiplicative noise algorithms used to produce the turbulent signal contain implicit assumptions on the nature of the turbulent flow that go beyond the task of reproducing anomalous structure function scaling.

Typically, these synthetic signals are expressed as a superposition of wavelets with random coefficients:

[formula]

where Ψ(x) is the synthetic turbulent signal, with wS(k,y,x), wavelets of scale k and position y [\cite=daubechies], and the vector index [formula] identifying the position of the wavelet in the cascade through the sequence of its ancestors: the integer hn labels the hn-th daughter wavelet generated at the n-th step in the cascade, by wavelet [formula]. The standard practice [\cite=benzi93] is to arrange the wavelets on a tree structure in k - y space, with [formula], hi  =    ±  1 [formula]. The amplitudes [formula] are then generated through a random multiplicative process.

This picture closely parallels the one of a random beta model [\cite=benzi85]; the resulting correlation pattern has clearly a multifractal (multiaffine) nature, depending on the singularity (lack of singularity) of Ψ(x), as N  →    ∞   in Eqn. (1). The difference, in the case of the beta model, is that the multiplicative random process, arises explicitly out of the assumption of an energy transfer, local in both space and scale.

The purpose of this letter is to present some techniques, based on the use of wavelet and Fourier analysis, to extract informations on the algorithm of signal generation, directly from the signal statistics. We focus in particular on two important aspects: the determination of which "building block" wavelet wS is being used in the synthetic signal, and which is the typical interaction distance between wavelets, as expressed by the separation in k - y space: [formula]. In real turbulence, these aspects have a direct interpretation in terms of eddy structure and energy transfer properties.

The choice of the wavelet, identifies a cell of k - y space, which acts coherently to generate intermittency; this is in practice determined by the "number of wiggles" of the wavelet, i.e. the product aS = kλS of its characteristic wavevector and spatial extension. We can thus focus on the case in which wS is a Gaussian wavepacket, without fear of loosing to much in generality:

[formula]

The interaction distance provides informations on the degree of non-locality of the dynamics, by telling us whether only nearest neighbor cells in k - y space can interact directly, or longer range interactions are allowed. The algorithms of turbulence synthesis studied in [\cite=benzi93], [\cite=arneodo98] and [\cite=benzi98] are strictly local. To allow for non-locality, the simplest approach is to treat the wavelet coordinates in k - y space, on the same ground as the amplitudes [formula], as stochastic variables. In this way, the wavelets take more the aspect of eddies, with complete freedom of location (and overlap) in k - y space [\cite=olla98]. The dynamics is described through the probability for the transition [formula], which is taken in the form: pA(A' / A|k' / k)pk(k' / k)px(k|y - y'|), with [formula] ×  pA(y|x) = cpx-  ζp to insure power law scaling in k for the moments of A. The phases are supposed random so that intermittency in Ψ arises simply as a consequence of the intermittency of the amplitudes A. We take for simplicity, px and pk to be Gaussians respectively in space separation and [formula]. The transition probabilities over n cascade steps will be Gaussians as well:

[formula]

[formula]

with [formula] giving the amount of space non-locality and Δz /  the degree of discreteness in scale, in the cascade algorithm. Thus, the wavelet wavevectors in the cascade will be centered at k̄n  =  k̄0 exp (n) with increasing width [formula]. The probability pA, which is the multiplier distribution for the coeffincients [formula], can be obtained starting from the distribution of the scaling exponents ζq, using standard techniques [\cite=chhabra89]. We do not need its explicit form here, however. To measure effects such as the degrees of interaction non-locality and discreteness, in an intermittent signal of unknown origin, multiscale-multispace wavelet correlations would be clearly the instrument of choice [\cite=arneodo98], [\cite=benzi98]. This is conditioned, however, to having some knowledge of the structure of the building block wavelets wS, especially, as regards the value of the parameter aS.

The simplest wavelet correlations are 〈|Ψky|2〉 and 〈|Ψky|2|Ψk'y'|2〉, where Ψky is the component of Ψ on a wavelet ( - k)- s∂sxwA(k,y,x). Here, wA is taken again to be a Gaussian wavepacket, with aA = kλA not necessarily equal to aS, and s is chosen large enough to kill large scale contributions to Ψ:

[formula]

In a cascade model like the one considered here, the wavelet components Ψky entering 〈|Ψky|2 ×  |Ψk'y'|2〉 may come from a single building block wavelet wS ("one-eddy" contribution), if |k - k'| and |y - y'| are both small enough; otherwise they will come predominantly from two distinct wS placed at (k,y) and (k',y') ("two-eddy" contribution). If |y - y'| < L, with L the largest scales in the signal, there will be a correlation between the two building block wavelets wS, due to their coming from some common ancestor at scale   ~  aS|y - y|- 1. This situation is expressed through the formula:

[formula]

with [formula] and p the cascade step at which the genealogical tree of [formula] and [formula] branches: hi = h'i for 0  ≤  i  ≤  p and hi  ≠  h'i for i > p. Thus, the lower the branching takes place in the tree, the closer the correlation gets to its disconnected limit [formula].

Indicate with C(k,y;k',y') the square modulus of the component of wS with respect to wA:

[formula]

[formula]

where Δk = kA - kS and Δy = yA - yS. We can now write down the expression for the second order correlation. From Eqn. (3), for ln kL  >  3  /  Δz2, discreteness effects can be neglected, and we have, indicating with 〈Pk(n,k̄  /  k̄0)〉, average over the size of the large scale building block wavelets:

[formula]

where the difference ε  =  ζ'2  -  ζ2  =  O(- 3Δz2) is due to the fluctuation in the scale ratio between a daughter wavelet [formula] and her parent [formula], and we have used the result, valid for ln k / k̄0  >  3  /  Δz2: [formula]. We have a similar expression for the one-eddy contribution to the 4-th order correlation:

[formula]

From Eqns. (8) and (6), if the space-scale separation is large enough, 〈|Ψky|2|Ψk'y'|2〉 will be dominated by the two-eddy contribution. In this case, however, it is not sufficient to impose that kL be large, to avoid discreteness effects. Limiting the calculation to the connected part of the correlation, we find:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where (k̄m  /  k̄p)Px(|  -  '|) is the space density at ', of wavelets [formula] generated from the branching at [formula], given the presence of a wavelet [formula] at [formula], and k̄n is the space density of wavelets [formula]. From here, informations on the space-scale structure of the intermittent signal can in principle be obtained. The slow decay of correlations between wavelets, shown in Eqn. (5), however, suggests that the effect of coherency, important for k|y - y'| < aS, and the one of interactions, important for k|y - y'| < aS, will be superimposed in a way that is difficult to disentangle. This warns against trying to measure aS looking for crossovers in the space scaling of correlations. We have in fact two mechanisms of correlation distruction: one is the decay of the one-eddy contribution, due to the two analyzing wavelets ceasing to overlap with a single wS. The second is the decay of the two-eddy contribution, i.e. the decrease with distance of the correlation between different wS. Only the first effect, of course, gives informations about the shape of wS.

Surprisingly, this strongly local information is more easily obtained using a fully global instrument like a Fourier transform, at least if the random phase hypothesis is satisfied. The reason is the maximal definition in scale of a Fourier component. In this case, a correlation like 〈Ψ2- kΨk - ΔΨk + Δ〉, with Ψk standard Fourier components, will be non-zero only when Δ  <  λ- 1S = k / aS; in fact, a 4-th order correlation can receive contributions at most by two wS (plus their complex conjugate), which cannot cover a section of k including at the same time - k, k - Δ and k + Δ, when Δ is large. In the example of our cascade model, we can calculate this fourth order correlation rather easily. In the case of negligible discreteness effects, we find:

[formula]

where [formula] and the two terms in square brackets are respectively the one- and two-eddy contribution to the correlation. Once aS is known, it is possible to set aA = aS in the analyzing wavelet, in order to maximize the overlap between the analyzing wavelets wA and the coherent regions identified by the building block wavelets wS. At this point it is possible to look at the dependence on space and scale separation, of the expression for the correlation 〈|Ψky|2|Ψk'y'|2〉c provided by Eqn. (9). We consider first the case in which discreteness effects can be neglected, corresponding to the regime ln k' / k > 3  /  Δz2. Setting aA = aS we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

where F = - 2(1 + (k / k')2). From inspection of this equation, we see that the integral receives contribution, for aS large enough, from [formula], where the integrand is essentially exp ((ζ'4 - 2ζ'2)x). We find then, for 2ζ'2  -  ζ'4 small:

[formula]

where [formula]. We thus have a close range and a large separation range, with transition at [formula]. In the close range, the correlation scales only in k: 〈|Ψky|2|Ψk'y'|2〉c  ~  (kL)-  ζ'4(k' / k)-  ζ'2 ln kL, while, in the large separation regime, the correlation contains a factor scaling like a power in |y - y'|: [formula]. This slow decay in |y - y'|, observed also in [\cite=arneodo98], and the one of structure functions, with respect to aA [\cite=olla98], have the same origin in the dependence on [formula] of [formula]
