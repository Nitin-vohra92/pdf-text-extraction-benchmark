We consider four-dimensional charged black-holes occuring in toroidally compactified heterotic string theory, whose ten-dimensional interpretation involves a Kaluza-Klein monopole and a five-brane. We show that these four-dimensional black-holes can be connected to two-dimensional charged heterotic black-holes upon removal of the constants appearing in the harmonic functions associated with the Kaluza-Klein monopole and the five-brane.

April 1998

It was pointed out by Hyun in [\cite=hyun] that five-dimensional black-holes occuring in toroidally compactified type II string theory are related to two-dimensional black-holes by U-duality. In [\cite=teo] it was shown that the associated entropies agree. Here, we shall consider a particular class of extremal four-dimensional black-holes occuring in toroidally compactified heterotic string theory and we will connect it to a class of extremal two-dimensional heterotic black-holes. The two-dimensional black-holes in question [\cite=guinayo] [\cite=gipe] are derived from the heterotic string target-space action

[formula]

We will show that the associated entropies match. It should be straightforward to extend this connection to the case of non-extremal black-holes.

The extremal four-dimensional heterotic black-holes we will consider are the ones obtained by compactifying the heterotic ten-dimensional solution describing the intersection of a string, a five-brane, a Kaluza-Klein monopole and a wave [\cite=cvetsey]. The ten-dimensional line element is given by

[formula]

where the [formula] (i  =  0,1,5,KK) denote the harmonic functions associated with the wave, the string, the five-brane and the Kaluza-Klein monopole, respectively. Also Fij  =  ∂iAj  -  ∂jAi  =  εijk∂kHKK. The ten-dimensional dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor are given by

[formula]

Dimensionally reducing in the y,z,x6,x7,x8,x9 directions and going to the Einstein frame yields the four-dimensional metric

[formula]

This describes an extremal four-dimensional black-hole, and its entropy is given by [\cite=cveyou]

[formula]

where A denotes the area of the horizon and G4 denotes Newton's constant in four dimensions.

Before relating this four-dimensional black-hole to an extremal two-dimensional black-hole, let us first link the near-horizon geometry of the former to the geometry of a three-dimensional BTZ black-hole, as in [\cite=hyun] [\cite=sfeske] [\cite=balalars]. This is achieved by dimensionally reducing ([\ref=lineten]) in the z,x6,x7,x8,x9 directions and by going to the Einstein frame. In the near-horizon region (Qi / r  ≫  1) the resulting five-dimensional metric is given by

[formula]

The five-dimensional dilaton and the zz component of the metric are approximately constant and given by [formula] and gzz = Q5 / QKK, respectively. The five-dimensional metric can be rewritten as [\cite=balalars]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and where τ  =  lt,  ρ2  =  2(r  +  Q0) / l,  φ  =  y,  0  ≤  φ  ≤  2π. This geometry describes a space which is the product of a two-sphere of radius l / 2 and an extremal BTZ black-hole with mass M and angular momentum J. Note that the BTZ part and the sphere are completely decoupled. Inspection of ([\ref=lineten]) and ([\ref=dilaten]) shows that the two-sphere supports a U(1) gauge field. The extremal BTZ black-hole carries entropy [\cite=banados]

[formula]

where G3 denotes the three-dimensional Newton's constant. Using that the three and four-dimensional Newton's constants are related by [\cite=balalars] [formula] it follows that the BTZ entropy ([\ref=entrothree]) agrees with the macroscopic entropy ([\ref=entrofour]) of the four-dimensional black-hole.

Next consider the five-dimensional metric in the string frame, obtained by reducing ([\ref=lineten]) over z,x6,x7,x8,x9:

[formula]

The five-dimensional dilaton reads [formula]. Let us now drop the constant part in the harmonic functions H5 and HKK associated with the five-brane and the Kaluza-Klein monopole, so that the resulting space-time is no longer asymptotically flat. Below we will argue that the constant part in these harmonic functions should be removable by a sequence of S and T-S-T duality transformations in four dimensions. Let us furthermore identify H0  =  H1. Then, the line element ([\ref=linefive]) turns into

[formula]

Note that gzz  =  Q5 / QKK is now constant. Dimensionally reducing ([\ref=nlinefive]) in the y direction yields

[formula]

This metric describes the product of two two-dimensional spaces, one of which we will relate to a two-dimensional black-hole and one which is a two-sphere with radius [formula]. Inspection of ([\ref=lineten]) and ([\ref=dilaten]) shows that each of the two-dimensional geometries supports a U(1) gauge field. Both two-dimensional parts are completely decoupled. Note that since the internal components of the metric gyy and gzz are constant, the only non-trivial scalar field is the dilaton.

The solution ([\ref=linett]) can now be related to the two-dimensional heterotic black-hole solution of McGuigan, Nappi and Yost [\cite=guinayo] as follows. The latter is described by

[formula]

Here m and q are constants related to the mass and to the electric charge of the solution, with m  >  0 and m2  ≥  q2. Q is a positive constant which determines the central charge deficit c = Q2 appearing in the action ([\ref=twoact]). The asymptotic flat region corresponds to x  =    ∞  , whereas the curvature singularity is at x  =    -    ∞  . By changing the spatial variable to y  =  e- Qx, the solution ([\ref=bh2]) becomes

[formula]

The asymptotic flat region is now at y = 0, the curvature singularity is at y  =    ∞  , while th two horizons are at [formula]. In the following, we will consider the extremal case, which corresponds to m = q and hence to y1  =  y2  =  q- 1. By setting

[formula]

the solution ([\ref=twobh]) can be turned into

[formula]

The two-dimensional (t,r) part of ([\ref=linett]) thus agrees with the charged black-hole solution ([\ref=nbh]) provided that the parameters a,Q and q appearing in ([\ref=nbh]) are related to the charges Q1,Q5 and QKK as follows:

[formula]

The field strength of the gauge field in ([\ref=nbh]) agrees with Hrty  =  ∂rBty given in ([\ref=dilaten]), up to a constant.

The entropy of the charged two-dimensional black-hole ([\ref=twobh]) was computed in [\cite=guinayo] [\cite=napasq] using thermodynamic methods. For an extremal black-hole, it is given by

[formula]

Here, G2 denotes the two-dimensional Newton's constant, which was set to G2  =  1 / (16π) in [\cite=guinayo] [\cite=napasq]. Inspection of ([\ref=linett]) shows that G2 is related to Newton's constant G4 in four dimensions by

[formula]

where V denotes the area of the two-sphere with radius [formula]. Inserting ([\ref=g2g4]) as well as ([\ref=param]) into the entropy formula ([\ref=entrotwo]) yields

[formula]

in agreement with the macroscopic formula ([\ref=entrofour]) of the four-dimensional black-hole.

We note here that we expect each of the decoupled two-dimensional geometries of ([\ref=linett]) to be described by an exact CFT. We refer to [\cite=steif] [\cite=horne] [\cite=john] [\cite=sfettsey] for a discussion of the CFT description of the two-dimensional charged black-hole ([\ref=bh2]).

We would now like to argue that there is a sequence of S and T-S-T duality transformations which can be used to shift the constant part of the harmonic functions H5 and HKK. Consider dimensionally reducing the ten-dimensional line element ([\ref=lineten]) in the t,y,x6,x7,x8,x9 directions, that is consider compactifying it on a six-torus with Lorentzian signature. The resulting four-dimensional metric in the Einstein frame and the four dimensional dilaton read

[formula]

The antisymmetric tensor field Hzij given in ([\ref=dilaten]) can be dualised to an axion field b, which can then be combined with e- 2φ into S±  =  b  ±  e- 2φ [\cite=bakas]. S± can undergo SL(2,R) transformations. The form of the line element ([\ref=lineeu]) makes it clear that, in the case that H1 = HKK = 1, these SL(2,R) transformations can be used to shift away the constant part of H5. Similarly, in the case that H1  =  H5 = 1, there exists [\cite=bakas] a sequence of T-S-T duality transformations which can be used to remove the constant term in HKK. In view of that, we expect that also in the case where H1,H5 and HKK are all non-constant, there is a certain sequence of S and T-S-T duality transformations which is capable of removing the constant terms in H5 and HKK. If so, the solutions ([\ref=lineten]) with and without constant terms in H5 and HKK would be dual to one another.
