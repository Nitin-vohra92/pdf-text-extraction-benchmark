Biharmonic pattern selection

Introduction

The study of pattern formation in physically important fields by using simple lattice models under certain boundary conditions is of great interest because they describe many phenomena as occur in nature. At present, numerical simulation studies include, e.g., the dielectric breakdown model (DBM), i.e., solving the Laplacian equation in the medium surrounding the growing aggregates [\cite=Nie84] [\cite=Arian89] [\cite=Can91], and the Poisson growth model to the pattern formation in screened electrostatic fields [\cite=Lou92]. Besides, the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model also plays a crucial role in illustrating fractal growth [\cite=LaRo91] [\cite=Bow91] [\cite=Arne92]. So far, many efforts have been invested in such stochastic models that share the common feature of being essentially second-order differential equations. In these models iterative procedures are carried out around four mesh points of a lattice to then phenomenologically relate the global influence of a growing pattern to the growth probability for each lattice site under different power-law forms (see, e.g., [\cite=Meak91]).

Nevertheless, there is also another important class of physical problems leading to partial differential equations that can also be linear in the order parameter but, as a peculiarity, they are of higher order and directly concern the issue of pattern formation. An example of this is the (time-averaged) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation [\cite=Kura78] [\cite=Siva79]:

[formula]

which models pattern formation in different physical contexts, such as chemical reaction-diffusion systems [\cite=Hym86] [\cite=Shra86] and a cellular gas flame in the presence of external stabilizing factors [\cite=Malo84]. In the above ν, λ and μ are normalized coefficients and u a displacement at time t.

If we consider the simplest case, i.e. assume static solutions and keep linear terms only ( i.e., [formula]), then Eq.([\ref=eq:1q]) reduces to the sum of two important terms: the Laplacian equation plus the Biharmonic equation

[formula]

Since the former term ( i.e. λ = 0), when discretized, is known to display fractal structures on a squared lattice [\cite=Nie84] [\cite=Arian89], then the latter term ( i.e., Eq.([\ref=eq:w1])) might also in fact select a new class of fractal patterns.

In addition to the above physical relevance, the biharmonic part of Eq.([\ref=eq:1q]) can describe the deflection of a thin plate subjected to uniform loading over its surface with fixed edges [\cite=Can91] [\cite=Land59], the steady slow two-dimensional (2D) motion of a viscous fluid [\cite=Lamb32] or the vibration modes in the acoustic of drums [\cite=Ross92]. Besides this a higher-order differential equation containing the biharmonic term also appears in the study of kinetic growth with surface relaxation (see, e.g., [\cite=Wo90] [\cite=Lai91] [\cite=Lam91] [\cite=Yan92]).

As an important difference with respect to second-order, to solve numerically higher-order differential equations, such as the one at hand, requires values for the order parameters at either their first or second normal derivatives at each boundary point and beyond [\cite=Gde86] [\cite=Bue91]. Hence, an analysis of effects due to long-range (many-body) coupling of lattice sites, including those mesh points at the lattice boundaries, on the formation of connected patterns is by no means trivial and as such it is a completely open problem. This is the subject of this paper.

In the following we shall discuss what we believe to be the first attempt to include higher nearest neighbour (displacements) shells in numerical simulations of fractal growth in isotropic defect-free media of arbitrary elastic constants. We achieve this by (analytically and numerically) studying Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) under the condition that the Laplacian of u is not constant ( i.e., Laplace's case) or proportional to u ( i.e., Poisson's case) along a growing surface. Since this biharmonic operator can also be generated in the theory of elasticity [\cite=Land59] [\cite=Ball90] [\cite=Meak89], then [formula] may become the displacement vector and the deformation of a body may be caused by an applied force which appears in the solution of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) through some boundary conditions (Eq.([\ref=eq:w6]) below).

Numerical simulation

In this work, the numerical simulation of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) is carried out on a lattice with either planar ( i.e., growth in a channel) or circular ( i.e., radial growth) geometries. Within the planar geometry we use a 100  ×  200 lattice, having periodic boundary conditions along the x-direction, and set the values uo = 1 and ui = 0 for the upper y-boundary and the surface aggregate ([formula]), respectively. Initially, seed particles are placed on a line at displacement u(i,1). For circular geometry, we use lattice sites enclosed within a circunference of radius r = 100 and locate only one seed at the center such that uo and ui are also unity and zero at the outer (circular) boundary and at the inner (growing) aggregate, respectively.

The inclusion of (second and higher-) nearest neighbour bond shells in our numerical simulations follows the discrete form of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) on the (i,j) lattice site, which yields an expression involving values of u at thirteen mesh points written as [\cite=Gde86]

[formula]

It is important to mention that numerical simulations using this equation are somehow more involved than for Laplace [\cite=Nie84] or Poisson [\cite=Lou92] growth because of long-range coupling. However, the accuracy of the solution for Eq.([\ref=eq:w2]) can similarly be improved by looking at the convergence of the iterative solution using the Gauss-Seidel method [\cite=Gde86].

Equation ([\ref=eq:w1]) requires modificiation when applied at mesh points that are adjacent to a boundary, since one (at the edge) or two (near the corners) of the values needed are at sites outside the lattice. This modification is made by introducing a fictitious mesh point at (i,L) outside the planar lattice in the y-direction, where the value of u is there given by the derivative boundary condition along one edge boundary:

[formula]

Here h  ( = hx = hy) is the mesh size which we set equal to unity for simplicity. For planar geometry, we evaluate Eq.([\ref=eq:w6]) approximating

[formula]

for all i-columns. This expression is obtained after taking the limit [formula] in the solution of a one-dimensional biharmonic equation. Also for simplicity, the values of u(i,0) for the points below the seed will be set to zero. For circular geometry we treat the boundary conditions similarly to Laplacian growth [\cite=Nie84], i.e., all the lattice sites outside a circle of radius r are set equal to uo, hence, we approximate for the sake of simplicity ∂u / ∂y|y = L  ≈  0 in the absence of applied field.

The procedure for growing our biharmonic aggregates follows standard techniques [\cite=Nie84]. First, Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) is solved iteratively till the solutions converge to a given accuracity (of the order 3  ×  10- 3 or smaller). Second, after adopting a growth probability law, the aggregates stochastically grow at one (or more) perimeter(s) under a given relation between u and growth probability P.

In order to have biharmonic pattern selection we shall assume that P at the grid site (i,j) depends on two different phenomenological (normalized) forms, namely

[formula]

where the sum runs over all of the nearest neighbour sites to an aggregagate. Model I implies that Pij is proportional to the local potential, similarly to DBM [\cite=Nie84] [\cite=Lou92] [\cite=Meak91]. Whereas in model II, Pij is proportional to displacements around the (i,j) site.

Results and discussion

As already mentioned we attempt to study effects of long-range coupling of displacements in simulations of fractal growth. To achieve this, we start analysing the numerical solutions of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) in planar geometry. In Figs.1(a), (b) and (c) we show three characteristic stages of growing for a biharmonic pattern by attaching one particle at each step and assuming model I for the probability Pij. Figure 1(a) includes 2100 particles, (b) 4164 particles and (c) 4355 particles added to the biharmonic cluster. In these numerical simulations we estimate the derivative boundary condition ( c.f., Eq.([\ref=eq:w6])) from the analytical solution given by Eq.([\ref=eq:madd1]) and fix ui = 0 and (rescaled) [formula] such that uo = 1. Clearly, at a distance separation of about [formula], Fig.1(c) displays features of a transition from dense to multibranched growth similarly to what occurs within Poisson growth in planar geometry [\cite=Lou92]. This structure demostrates that long-range coupling of displacements drives such phenomena.

Surprisely, such a transition also appears when we consider model II for Pij as can be seen in Fig.2 for a biharmonic cluster containing 3428 particles. This means that the influence of ramified biharmonic patterns on the growth probability for each lattice site is on the type of the (far from equilibrium) pattern obtained and not on locating the transition. We add that several branches may also develop within our biharmonic growth model by attaching -simultaneously, and stochastically- more than one particle at each time step similarly to Louis et al.'s work [\cite=Lou92]. We believe that for Poisson growth this transition is the result of including many-body contributions via screening in a sort of mean field approach. In our biharmonic model, long range coupling appears naturally as a consequence of dealing with Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]). As we shall show next for the case of planar growth, the transition point within both Poisson and biharmonic models appears when the growth velocities exhibit a minimum.

In Fig.3 we plot results for the grow velocity v along the y-direction for biharmonic growth under model I (curve A), i.e., proportional to the averaged value of P equal to [formula] to consider explicitly nearest neighbour sites, and under model II (curve B), where it has been set proportional to the local displacement u. For comparison, we also include in this figure results for Poisson growth: i.e., [formula] [\cite=Lou92], such that v is set proportional to the field |φi,j  -  φi| following Ref.[\cite=Lou92]. The Poisson growth model incorporates screening (curve C): i.e., μ  =  λ2 and antiscreening (curve D): i.e., μ =  - λ2.

In this plot it can be seen that the transition from dense to multibranched growth coincides with the fact that v on the growing surface presents a minimum. This was first pointed out by Louis et al. [\cite=Lou92] for the case of screening (curve C) (which also applies for antiscreening as seen in curve D). However, from the present findings, we can argue that this is also true for biharmonic growth (curves A and B) independently of how we have related the probability Pij to u(i,j). For Laplacian growth this phenomenon does not apper since the trend is to generate a single tip at faster velocity than in the cases of Poisson or biharmonic growth. It is worthwhile to point out that biharmonic patterns below the transition point, i.e., within the dense region (see Figs. 1 and 2), become not that denser as for screening [\cite=Lou92] but are rather denser than for antiscreening (not shown). Indeed, this can easily be understood from Fig.3 since for Poisson growth (screening), such that μ > 0, the transition occurs at smaller velocities than for biharmonic growth. Henceforth, a Eden-like pattern can be generated due to screening [\cite=Lou92]. Above the transition multibranched fractals appear in all models considered, but within our biharmonic model the transition point depends on the system size only (as it will become clear below). We remark that both Poisson and biharmonic models lead to obtain growth velocities along the y-direction with parallel slopes above and below their respective transition points. We feel this to be a particular feature of fractal growth due to long-range coupling of displacements.

Let us focus next on effects due to long-range coupling on the fractal growth in circular geometry. This will allows us to make calculations of the fractal dimension for the biharmonic patterns by the standard box counting method [\cite=Can91]. To generate and select biharmonic fractal structures we set, for simplicity, the derivative boundary condition required along the r-direction equal to zero. Figures 4(a) and (b) show the results for circular biharmonic growth using again models I (where P is set proportional to [formula], which corresponds to the potential in [\cite=Lou92]) and II, respectively. Figure 4(a) includes 2326 particles whereas Fig.4(b) 2172 particles. It can immediately be seen that above a certain transition point, say [formula], these new plots give another demostration that long-range coupling is the most relevant aspect for the transition indepedently of the geometry adopted or of the given relation between Pij and u(i,j).

The transition point [formula] can, to a good approximation, be estimated from the continuous limit of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) in cylindrical coordinates, such that z = 0 for all polar angles θ, namely

[formula]

whose solution (far from the origin) is

[formula]

Clearly, two of the four coefficients A,B,C and D may be determined by the boundary conditions of the problem, i.e., by assuming that at [formula]: [formula], whereas at r = L, [formula]. However, as discussed above, in addition to this we also have the condition required by simulations ( c.f., Eq.([\ref=eq:w6])): [formula], which leads to the following relation between B,C and D:

[formula]

This in conjuction with one possible condition of stability for the trajectories at the growing surfaces, that is obtained from [formula]: i.e., [formula] and C = 0, gives

[formula]

Hence, we have that the transition point only depends on the system size L and occurs approximately at a distance (in lattice units) about 60% far from the seed particle as indicated by arrows in Figs.4(a) and (b). Nicely, our simplest prediction is in accord with the numerical simulations. But if the derivative boundary condition ∂u / ∂r|r = L is a constant different from zero, then Eq.([\ref=eq:Madd4]) changes by a factor which, together with the above stability conditions, implies a shift of the transition length and a more complicated relation between [formula] and L.

To end this section, we examine the fractal properties of the simulated biharmonic patterns displayed in Figs.4(a) and (b), by simply counting the number of particles, N(r), inside a circle of increasing radius r (in lattice units) around a seed particle at the origin until we reach a distance [formula] at which the transition appears ( c.f., Eq.([\ref=eq:Madd2])). We then plot it as a function of r in a log -log  plot, as despicted in Fig.5, for models I (triangles) and II (squares) which we compare to Laplacian growth (circles). Over a decade, we obtain lines with slopes larger than unity and smaller than the space dimension. Thus, to a first approximation, the fractal dimension of our biharmonic patterns in the denser region approaches the value due to DBM (and DLA) within error bars [\cite=Nie84]. This illustrates the fractal nature of the biharmonic patters. Above [formula], there is a change of slope due to the transition from dense to multibranched growth on contrary to the curve from the Laplacian model (circles) which continues to be linear indicating thus that the cluster grows dense.

Concluding remarks

In this work, we have shown that the discretization of the biharmonic Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) allows to reproduce a transition from dense to multibranched growth at a point in which the growth velocity v along the y-direction exhibits a minimum similarly to what occurs within Poisson growth in planar geometry. The physical basis for v, as plotted in Fig.3, follows similarly to the dielectric breakdown model (model I: curve A), namely assuming v to be proportional to the averaged value of P equal to the potential [formula] -to thus consider explicitly nearest neighbour sites. Whereas, model II: curve B, where v has been set proportional to the local displacement u, is simply a mathematical model. On the other hand, we also discussed that in circular geometry the transition point can be estimated from the relation [formula] such that the trajectories become stable at the growing surfaces in a continuous limit. This is in reasonable agreement with present numerical simulations. Hence, we conclude that the transition from dense to multibranched growth within a biharmonic approach depends on the system size L only.

The transition obtained from numerically solving the biharmonic equation might not be necessarily similar to the novel and intriguing Hecker transition (see e.g. [\cite=Fleu91] [\cite=Fleu92]). But, to this end, we notice that when assuming in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky relation ([\ref=eq:1q]), ν < 0 and λ > 0, then we obtain (see also [\cite=Kura78])

[formula]

in which [formula] and [formula]. This looks somewhat like the Navier-Stokes equation (for a potential flow with negative viscosity) which may be somehow related to the recent analysis in Ref.[\cite=Fleu92] of electrochemical deposition.

Finally, it is important to emphasize again that -as a crucial difference to those models satisfying second order differential equations- to select fractal structures via the biharmonic part of Eq.([\ref=eq:1q]) requires values for the order parameters (at either their first or second normal derivatives at each boundary point) and the (second and higher-) nearest neighbour bond shells on the (i,j) lattice site which yields an expression involving values of u at thirteen mesh points. Thus, the formation of connected patterns within the biharmonic equation is not trivial at all. Because of this, our numerical simulations are more involved than for Laplace (or Poisson) fractal growth due to the long-range coupling between diplacements.
