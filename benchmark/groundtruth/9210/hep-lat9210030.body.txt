Long time ago G. 't Hooft and S. Mandelstam[\cite=thooft75] proposed that the confining vacuum is a coherent state of color magnetic monopoles. This proposal offers a picture of confinement whose physics can be clearly extracted. Indeed the dual Meissner effect causes the formation of chromoelectric flux tubes between chromoelectric charges leading to a linear confining potential. Following Ref. [\cite=thooft81], one can study the monopole condensation by means of the so called Abelian projection. It turns out that [\cite=kronfeld87] it is possible to implement the Abelian projection on the lattice, where the Abelian projection amounts to fix the gauge by diagonalizing an operator which transforms according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group. In this paper we consider the SU(2) gauge group with standard Wilson action on a 124 lattice in the maximally Abelian gauge [\cite=laursen87]. In this gauge one diagonalize the lattice operator

[formula]

The gauge is fixed iteratively via overrelaxation like the Landau gauge [\cite=mandula]. We adopted a convergence criterion which coincides with the one of Ref. [\cite=hioki91]

The aim of this paper is to analyze the dual Meissner effect by studying the color fields distribution due to a static quark-antiquark pair. To measure the color fields we follow the method of Ref. [\cite=digiacomo]. These authors measure the correlation of a plaquette UP with a Wilson loop W. The plaquette is connected to the Wilson loop by a Schwinger line L:

[formula]

By moving the plaquette UP with respect to the Wilson loop one can scan the structure of the color fields. Note that in the naïve continuum limit, the operator ρW is sensitive to the fields rather than to the square of the fields [\cite=digiacomo].

Following the Abelian dominance idea [\cite=hioki191] we investigate the color field distribution by measuring

[formula]

where the superscript means that the Wilson loop and the plaquette are built from the abelian projected links.

We use Wilson loop of size 5. We average over 500 configurations (each one separated by 50 upgrades, after 3000 sweeps to equilbrate the lattice) in the range 2.4  ≤  β  ≤  2.525.

The authors of Ref. [\cite=digiacomo] found a sizeable signal for the chromoelectric field parallel to the flux tube (UP parallel to W). So we focus on the longitudinal chromoelectric field. By moving the plaquette outside the plane of Wilson loop up to distance 5 in lattice units, we measure the transverse profile of the longitudinal chromoelectric field in the middle of the flux tube. In Fig. 1 we show the result for two different value of β.

The authors of Ref. [\cite=digiacomo] found that the transverse shape of the flux tube can be fitted in accordance with

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=gauss]) describes the flux tube like a relativistic string with gaussian fluctuations [\cite=lusher81].

We find that also our data can be fitted by Eq. ([\ref=gauss]). In Fig. 1 the dashed line is the result of the fit ([\ref=gauss]) (AG is fixed by [formula]). Moreover in Fig. 2 we check the scaling of μG. We find that μG scales and

[formula]

Such nice scaling property is not shared by AG and mG. The value ([\ref=mug]) is quite close to the one [formula] obtained in Ref. [\cite=digiacomo] by using non abelian quantities on a 164 cooled lattice. Thus, we feel that this result support the Abelian dominance idea.

On the other hand, we find that the data are compatible with another functional form, namely

[formula]

where K0 is the modified Bessel function of order zero. Equation ([\ref=k0]) is a straigthforward consequence of the dual superconductor hypothesis (see also the infrared effective theory of the monopole condensation proposed in Ref. [\cite=suzuki88]). Indeed, let us consider a second kind superconductor in an external static magnetic field. If we have an isolated vortex line, then in the London limit the magnetic field satisfies the London equation [\cite=degennes89]

[formula]

where h is the magnetic field parallel to the vortex line, [formula] the transverse distance from the vortex line, and φ0 the magnetic flux. The penetration depth λ is related to the photon mass by the well known relation

[formula]

The solution of Eq. ([\ref=london]) is

[formula]

Interchanging magnetic with electric, we are lead to consider the fit Eq. ([\ref=k0]) with [formula] and AM  ~  μ2M.

Recently, it has been shoved that [\cite=haymaker92] that the longitudinal electric field of the U(1) flux tube satisfies the dual London equation. We will compare our method with the one of Ref. [\cite=haymaker92] in a separate paper.

The results of the fit Eq. ([\ref=k0]) are plotted as solid line in Fig. 1. Both fits Eqs. ([\ref=gauss]) and  ([\ref=k0]) give a comparable reduced χ2. Moreover μM scales (see Fig. 3):

[formula]

It turns out that (see Fig. 4):

[formula]

Following Ref. [\cite=lusher81] we can define the width of the flux tube by

[formula]

From Equations ([\ref=width]) and  ([\ref=k0])we obtain

[formula]

Using [\cite=digiacomo] [formula] and Eq. ([\ref=mum]) we get

[formula]

which is close to the value estimated in Ref. [\cite=digiacomo].

In a previous paper [\cite=cea91] we propose a method to measure the abelian photon mass by means of the connected correlation function of an operator with the quantum number of the photon. In order to check Eq. ([\ref=photonmass]) we recorded also the abelian photon mass. In Figure (5) we display μM / mγ versus β. Even though there are large statistical fluctuations, mainly due to the abelian photon mass, we see that the relation Eq. ([\ref=photonmass]) is consistent with Monte Carlo data.

In conclusion we have showed that the transverse distribution of the longitudinal chromoelectric field due to a static quark-antiquark pair satisfies the dual London equation. However, care must be taken of self-energy effects from the Wilson line. So our results should be checked on larger lattices. We showed that the London penetration length scales according to asymptotic freedom. This suggests that the penetration length is a gauge invariant physical quantity. Some preliminary results on a larger lattice [\cite=cea92] support this conclusion. Needless to say, this matter will be deepen in future studies.
