On the isotropy constant of projections of polytopes

Introduction

The boundedness of the isotropy constant (see definition below) is a major conjecture in Asymptotic Geometric Analysis. The answer is known to be positive for many families of convex bodies, see for instance [\cite=MP] or [\cite=KK] and the references therein. In this paper we focus our attention on the isotropy constant of polytopes or, equivalently, of projections of the unit ball of [formula] space (in the symmetric case) and of the regular n-dimensional simplex Sn (in the non-symmetric case).

M. Junge [\cite=J1] proved that the isotropy constant of all orthogonal projections of Bnp, the unit ball of the [formula] space, 1 < p  ≤    ∞  , is bounded by [formula] an estimate improved to [formula] in [\cite=KM] (p' is the conjugate exponent of p and C a numerical constant). Later [\cite=J2] M. Junge showed that the isotropy constant of any symmetric polytope with 2n vertices is bounded by C log n, see also [\cite=milman-dual-mixed-volumes-and-slicing-problem].

In a recent paper, [\cite=KK], B. Klartag and G. Kozma show the boundedness of the isotropy constant of random Gaussian polytopes. The integral over a polytope, which defines its isotropy constant, is computed by passing to an integral over its surface (faces). A consequence of their results is that "most" (see precise meaning below) d-dimensional projections of Bn1 as well as of Sn have bounded isotropy constant. When reading this statement one should have in mind the well-known fact that every symmetric convex body in [formula] is "almost" a projection of a Bn1-ball, with possibly large n. In the same spirit, positive answers for other random d-dimensional polytopes with n (  ≥  Cd) vertices were given in [\cite=A] and [\cite=DGG].

Our main theorem (Corollary [\ref=isotropy-constant-polytopes]) states that for any d-dimensional polytope K with n vertices its isotropy constant LK verifies

[formula]

where C > 0 is a numerical constant.

We now pass to describe the contents of the paper. The second section introduces the geometric tool (Proposition [\ref=betke:main-proposition]) necessary to deal with integration on d-dimensional projections of polytopes (Corollary [\ref=betke:main-corollary]). Some time ago, one of the authors learned about this tool from Prof. Franck Barthe. The ideas originate from a paper by U. Betke [\cite=betke], where a general result was presented, namely a related formula for mixed volumes of two polytopes. However, for the sake of completeness, we provide the proof of the particular result we need. It also seems that the content of the proof is more geometric.

In the third Section we use these tools to prove our aforementioned main result (Corollary [\ref=isotropy-constant-polytopes]) by easily reducing it to the cases K = PEBn1 or K = PESn (Theorem [\ref=isotropic-constant-of-proj-of-b1n-ball]) where [formula] is any d-dimensional subspace and PE is the orthogonal projection onto E. Also in this Section we give a proof of the observation that for "most" subspaces, that is, for a subset A of the Grassmann space Gn,d of Haar probability measure ≥  1 - c1e- c2 max { log n,d}, one has LPEBn1 < C and LPESn < C for every E∈A with numerical constants C,c1,c2 (Proposition [\ref=prop-3-3]).

The next Section studies the isotropy constant of projections of random polytopes with vertices on the sphere Sn - 1. Using the techniques from Section 2 and [\cite=A] we show that, with high probability, the isotropy constants of all d-dimensional projections of random polytopes are bounded by [formula] (Proposition [\ref=prop-4-1]).

In the last Section we show that for every isotropic convex body, the isotropy constants of its hyperplane projections are comparable to the isotropy constant of the body itself (Corollary [\ref=AlonsoMP]). Recall that the analogous result for hyperplane sections was already proved in [\cite=MP]. The proof uses Steiner symmetrization in a similar way as it appears in [\cite=BKM], with better numerical constants. In particular, we have LPHBnp  ≤  C for any hyperplane H and 1 < p <   ∞   improving Junge's estimate [\cite=J1] for the case of hyperplanes. In [\cite=ABBW] a different proof of this fact is given with the hope it might be extended to lower dimensional projections.

We recall that a convex body [formula] is isotropic if it has volume n(K) = 1, the barycenter of K is at the origin and its inertia matrix is a multiple of the identity. Equivalently, there exists a constant LK > 0 called isotropy constant of K such that [formula].

It is well known [\cite=MP], that every convex body [formula] has an affine transformation K1 isotropic, so we can write LK: = LK1. This is well defined and moreover,

[formula]

For a convex body [formula], R(K) =  max {|x|  :x∈K} and r(K) =  min {|x|  :x∈K} are the circumradius and the inradius of K respectively.

We will think of Sn as an n-dimensional regular simplex in [formula] with center of mass at the origin. We will write [formula] for the natural position of an n-dimensional regular simplex in [formula].

The Lebesgue measure on an affine subspace E will be denoted by λE. For a measurable set A  ⊆  E, if d is a dimension of E, d(A) will stand for λE(A).

The notation a  ~  b means a  ·  c1  ≤  b  ≤  a  ·  c2 for some numerical constants c1,c2 > 0.

Projections of polytopes

Throughout this section, [formula] is a polytope (non-empty but possibly of empty interior), [formula] is a linear subspace of dimension d (1  ≤  d  ≤  n - 1) and PE is the orthogonal projection onto E.

Let us fix some notation and recall necessary definitions (we follow the book by Schneider [\cite=schneider]). For a subset [formula],   A denotes the minimal affine subspace which contains A. The dimension of a convex set A is     A. When writing   A we mean the relative interior of A w.r.t. the topology of   A. If [formula] is an affine subspace then G0 denotes the linear subspace parallel to G. A convex subset F  ⊆  K of a polytope K is called a face if for any x,y∈K, (x + y) / 2∈F implies x,y∈F (see also [\cite=schneider]). The set of j-dimensional faces (j-faces, in short) of K will be denoted as Fj(K) ([formula]), and [formula] is the set of all faces of K ([formula] is also a face). K can be decomposed into a disjoint union of {  F  ;  F∈F(K)} (see [\cite=schneider]). For that reason for any x∈K the unique face F∈F(K) such that x∈  F will be denoted by F(K,x).

For x∈K, a normal cone of K at x is

[formula]

N(K,x) is a closed convex cone. We shall also consider another closed convex cone, namely

[formula]

(In general, i.e. when K is a convex body, S(K,x) does not have to be closed.) By [\cite=schneider],

[formula]

where the polarity used here is the polarity of convex cones, namely, if [formula] is a convex cone,

[formula]

(see also [\cite=schneider]). We shall also need to consider normal cones taken w.r.t. an affine subspace. If G is an affine subspace of [formula] and L  ⊆  G is a convex body, then for x∈L we define a normal cone for L at x taken w.r.t. G:

[formula]

Note that NG(L,x)  ⊆  G0. The similar duality relation to ([\ref=betke:crucial-duality-of-cones-1]) holds:

[formula]

where the polarity is taken w.r.t. G0.

For any face [formula], define

[formula]

This definition does not depend on the choice of x (see [\cite=schneider]). NG(L,F) is analogously defined.

For a given polytope [formula] and a linear subspace [formula] of dimension d, let us fix any [formula] which satisfy

[formula]

Clearly, such u exists, since ([\ref=betke:condition-on-u]) excludes only a finite union of sets of dimension <  n - d from [formula] which is of dimension n - d.

Consider the following subsets of F(K):

[formula]

Let [formula] be a polytope, E a d-dimensional subspace, [formula] verifying ([\ref=betke:condition-on-u]) and (K,E,u) as described above. Then

{PE(  F)  ;  F∈(K,E,u)} is a family of pair-wise disjoint sets,

[formula].

Moreover, [formula] and for each F∈d(K,E,u), PE|F:F  →  PEF is an affine isomorphism.

In the proof of the proposition we shall use several lemmas.

Let L be a polytope in [formula] and [formula] be an affine subspace. If [formula] then

[formula]

By taking polars w.r.t. G0 we see that the assertion is equivalent to

[formula]

(for the l.h.s. we used the fact that for a convex cone C, [formula]). Since G0  =  G  -  x by ([\ref=betke:crucial-duality-of-cones-1]) we get

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=betke:crucial-duality-of-cones-2]) we see that the r.h.s. of ([\ref=betke:eq-for-normal-cones]) is also equal to [formula].

Let L be a polytope contained in an affine subspace [formula]. Then

[formula]

With the hypothesis as in the previous lemma, for x,y∈L,

[formula]

The inclusion ⊆   is immediate from the definition of a normal cone. For the converse inclusion take u∈NG(L,(x + y) / 2). Then [formula], [formula], so 〈x - y,u〉  =  0. Now, for all z∈L,

[formula]

so u∈NG(L,x). Similarly u∈NG(L,y).

With the hypothesis as in Lemma [\ref=betke:normal-cones-in-vertices-lemma], for [formula],

[formula]

Actually we shall use only the inequality   NG(L,F)  ≤    G  -    F which simply follows from the fact [formula].

Let [formula] be a polytope, [formula] be a linear subspace of dimension d and [formula] satisfies ([\ref=betke:condition-on-u]). Let y∈K, x  =  PEy∈E, [formula] (Kx is a polytope in [formula]). If one of the equivalent condition holds:

[formula],

[formula],

then {y}∈F0(Kx) and   F(K,y)  ≤  d.

The conditions (i) and (ii) are equivalent by Lemma [\ref=betke:projection-of-normal-cone-lemma]. Consider F  =  F(K,y) and F'  =  F(Kx,y). By the condition ([\ref=betke:condition-on-u]) on u,

[formula]

so [formula] and also   N(K,F)  ≥  n - d. Therefore Lemma [\ref=betke:dim-of-normal-cone-lemma] applied to Kx and F' implies   F'  =  0, so {y}  =  F'∈F0(Kx). Eventually, applying the same lemma to K and F yields   F  ≤  d.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=betke:main-proposition].

(a)

Take F1,F2∈(K,E,u) such that for some x∈E,

[formula]

which means that for i = 1,2 one can find [formula] that yi∈  Fi and then

[formula]

Consider a convex polytope [formula]. Lemma [\ref=betke:dim-of-faces-lemma] implies that {y1},{y2}∈F0(Kx) and also

[formula]

where the last equality is due to Lemma [\ref=betke:intersection-of-normal-cones-lemma]. But again, Lemma [\ref=betke:dim-of-faces-lemma] implies that also {(y1 + y2) / 2}∈F0(Kx), hence y1  =  y2 (see definition of a face) and consequently, F1  =  F(K,y1)  =  F2.

(b)

The inclusion "⊆  " is obvious. For the inclusion "⊇  " take arbitrary x∈PEK. Put [formula]. Kx is a non-empty polytope in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=betke:normal-cones-in-vertices-lemma] one can find [formula] such that {y}∈F0(Kx) and [formula]. Lemma [\ref=betke:dim-of-faces-lemma] (or just Lemma [\ref=betke:projection-of-normal-cone-lemma]) implies [formula] where F  =  F(K,y). Consequently, F∈(K,E,u).

By the definition of (K,E,u) and Lemma [\ref=betke:dim-of-faces-lemma], any face F∈(K,E,u) has dimension ≤  d.

Finally we show that for F∈d(K,E,u), PE|F:F  →  PEF is an isomorphism. The condition ([\ref=betke:condition-on-u]) and Lemma [\ref=betke:dim-of-normal-cone-lemma] implies

[formula]

so [formula]. This means [formula] and [formula]. The definition of a normal cone yields [formula], which finally gives [formula]. [formula]

The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=betke:main-proposition].

Let [formula] be a convex polytope, [formula] a d-dimensional linear subspace (1  ≤  d  ≤  n - 1). Then there exists a subset [formula] of Fd(K) such that for any integrable function [formula],

[formula]

In particular (for [formula]),

[formula]

Choose any [formula] satisfying ([\ref=betke:condition-on-u]) for K and E and put   =  d(K,E,u). By Proposition [\ref=betke:main-proposition],

[formula]

For our purposes we shall use above corollary with f(x)  =  |x|2. In such case, the obvious inequality |PEy|  ≤  |y| and the identity [formula] lead to the following estimate: if PEK is a body of dimension d (i.e. is non-degenerated) then

[formula]

Projections of the [formula]-ball and the regular simplex

First of all, we are going to see that "most" projections of Bn1 on d-dimensional subspaces (d  ≤  n) have the isotropy constant bounded. It is well known that any symmetric convex polytope in [formula] with 2n vertices is linearly equivalent to PEBn1 for some E∈Gn,d. Indeed, if [formula] is a linear transformation of full rank, then taking the d-dimensional subspace [formula], T can be represented as T|EPE where [formula] is a linear isomorphism being a restriction of T to the subspace E. As an immediate consequence we obtain the following

Let [formula] be a symmetric convex polytope with non-empty interior and let [formula] be the linear map such that Tei = vi. Then for [formula], PEBn1 and K are linearly equivalent.

One may also prove a similar lemma in the non-symmetric case. Recall that [formula] where H, as in the whole of this section, denotes the hyperplane orthogonal to the vector [formula].

Let [formula] (n  ≥  d) be a convex polytope with non-empty interior. Let [formula] be the linear map that Tei  =  vi  -  v0 where [formula] and [formula]. Then E  ⊆  H is a subspace of dimension d and K  -  v0 is linearly equivalent to PEΔn. Consequently, K is affinely equivalent to some orthogonal projection of the n-dimensional regular simplex Sn onto a d-dimensional subspace.

Clearly [formula], so E  ⊆  H. Since K has non-empty interior, vectors vi  -  v0 span the whole of [formula], so T is of full rank. Therefore   E  =  d and the argument given above applies.

Now we can prove the following result concerning the isotropy constant of random projections of Bn1 and Sn.

There exist absolute constants C,c1,c2 > 0 such that the Haar probability measure of the set of subspaces E∈Gn,d verifying

[formula]

is greater than 1 - c1e- c2 max { log n,d}.

For small values of d, namely d  ≤  c log n, the isotropy constant of a random projection is bounded by an absolute constant with probability greater than [formula] as a consequence of Dvoretzky's theorem.

Let G = (gij) be a d  ×  n Gaussian random matrix, i.e. the gij's are i.i.d N(0,1) Gaussian random variables. Since [formula], Gt being the transpose matrix of G, and the columns of Gt are independent and rotationally invariant random vectors in [formula], then a random subspace [formula] has dimension d a.s. and is distributed according to the Haar probability measure μ on Gn,d. Therefore for any constant C  >  0,

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=symm-polytope-equivalence] and the affine invariance of the isotropy constant imply [formula] a.s. Klartag and Kozma proved in [\cite=KK] that if C is a sufficiently large absolute constant,

[formula]

which completes the proof in the symmetric case.

For the non-symmetric case, we proceed analogously. For a d  ×  (n + 1) Gaussian random matrix G  =  (gij), take [formula]. Since the sum of the columns of [formula] is zero, [formula]. Moreover, since rows of [formula] (equivalently, columns of t) are independent canonical Gaussian random vectors in H, the random subspace [formula] is distributed according to the Haar probability measure on GH,d (Grassmann manifold of d-dimensional subspaces of H). Lemma [\ref=non-symm-polytope-equivalence] and the affine invariance of the isotropy constant imply [formula] a.s. Since PEΔn  =  PE(PHΔn) and PHΔn is an n-dimensional regular simplex (in H), a non-symmetric counterpart of the result of Klartag and Kozma [\cite=KK],

[formula]

finishes the proof.

In the final part of the section we will use the tools from Section 2 to prove the main result. In particular, whenever d  ≥  cn the boundedness of the isotropy constant holds not only for "most" projections of Bn1 and Sn but deterministically for all of them.

Let [formula] be a subspace of dimension 1  ≤  d  ≤  n - 1 and K  =  PEBn1, T  =  PESn. Then

[formula]

where C  >  0 is a universal constant.

As an immediate consequence of ([\ref=Milman-Pajor]),

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=betke:main-inequality]), we obtain the bound

[formula]

(for the last equality see e.g. [\cite=KK]). To estimate d(K) note that n- 1 / 2Bn2  ⊆  Bn1, so [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Combining these two, we get

[formula]

In the case of the simplex it is convenient to embed E and Sn into H. More precisely, we take [formula] and assume E  ⊆  H. Now observe that T  =  PESn  =  PEΔn so ([\ref=betke:main-inequality]) again yields

[formula]

To bound the volume radius of T from below, we use the Rogers-Shephard inequality [\cite=rogers-shephard]:

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Combining with the estimate ([\ref=proj-of-b1n-ball:volume-estimate]),

[formula]

Due to Lemma [\ref=non-symm-polytope-equivalence], we immediately get the following:

Let [formula] be a non-degenerated (  K  =  d) convex polytope with n vertices. Then

[formula]

Isotropy constant of projections of random polytopes

In this section we consider polytopes generated by the convex hull of vertices randomly chosen on the Sn - 1. The main result is

There exist absolute constants C, c1 and c2, such that if m  ≥  n, {Pi}mi = 0 are independent random vectors on Sn - 1 and [formula] or [formula], then

[formula]

The proof follows [\cite=A]. We shall only sketch the main ideas as the technical computations can be found in that reference.

Let [formula] denotes an d-dimensional subspace. The ideas in what follows will give us the proof for m  ≥  cn with an absolute constant c. If m < cn, Corollary [\ref=isotropy-constant-polytopes] gives deterministically [formula].

Apply once again (1.1). Writing r(K) the inradius of K and using the inequality ([\ref=betke:main-inequality]), the main consequence of Proposition [\ref=betke:main-proposition], we obtain that for any polytope [formula] and any d-dimensional subspace E,

[formula]

When K is the symmetric convex hull of m independent random points in Sn - 1, it was proved in [\cite=A], that for some constant c such that [formula],

[formula]

The same proof gives the statement in the non-symmetric case.

On the other hand, with probability 1, each d-dimensional face of K is a simplex [formula] with Qi  =  εiPji (or just Qi  =  Pji in the non-symmetric case) where [formula] and εi∈{ - 1,1}. The same proof as in [\cite=KK] and [\cite=A] shows that with probability 1 we have

[formula]

In order to give a bound for this quantity for a fixed F∈Fd(K) we proceed in the same way as in [\cite=A], by using a version of Bernstein's inequality as stated in [\cite=BLM]. We thus obtain

[formula]

for every ε  >  ε0, where ε0 is an absolute constant.

Now, for each F∈Fd(K) let [formula] be vertices of F. Applying ([\ref=random-bodies:estimate-for-single-face]) and the union bound over Fd(K) (whose cardinality is clearly bounded by [formula]), we obtain for [formula],

[formula]

since the function [formula] is increasing when [formula]. Consequently, by the union bound over d,

[formula]

Since m  ≥  cn, considering the complement set and using ([\ref=random-polytopes:identity-for-faces]), we can fix ε  >  0 a large enough numerical constant to obtain

[formula]

Thus, there exist constants c,C  >  0 such that if [formula] then the set of points [formula] for which the inequality [formula] holds for every d-dimensional subspace E and for every 1  ≤  d  ≤  n - 1 has probability greater than [formula].

In case [formula], for n large enough, [formula] with probability greater than 1 - e- n so with this probability

[formula]

and the proof is complete.

A general result

In this section we prove a general relation between the isotropy constant of the hyperplane projections of an isotropic convex body and of the body itself.

Let K be an isotropic convex body and let H be a hyperplane. Then

[formula]

Its proof relies on the next Proposition which improves the numerical constants appearing in a more general statement in [\cite=BKM] for the case of projections onto hyperplanes.

Let [formula] be an isotropic convex body and let [formula] be a hyperplane. If S(K) is the Steiner symmetrization of K with respect to H then,

[formula]

for some numerical constant c > 0.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula]. Write E = 〈en〉 for the 1-dimensional subspace generated by en. The Steiner symmetrization of K is defined by

[formula]

Clearly [formula].

Now we study the inertia matrix of S(K). First notice that for x∈PHK, [formula]. For every [formula], Fubini's theorem yields

[formula]

Using the fact that [formula] for x∈PHK, in the similar fashion we show that for every [formula],

[formula]

Also [formula] for x∈PHK, thus

[formula]

Taking σ  >  0 such that [formula], we obtain that the inertia matrix of S(K) is

[formula]

The volume of S(K) is 1, so LS(K)  =  (M)1 / 2n (see [\cite=MP]), which means

[formula]

Since σ  ≤  1, we obtain LS(K)  ≤  LK.

A well-known fact due to Hensley [\cite=H] states that [formula] for any convex body K1 with volume 1 and center of mass at the origin. Using this fact for K and S(K) in ([\ref=steiner]) we obtain that for some absolute constant c  >  0,

[formula]

Now we use the following inequalities:

[formula]

(For the proof, see for instance [\cite=P] where the first inequality is proved for a symmetric body K with c1  =  1 and the non-symmetric case can be proved similarly with an absolute constant c1  >  0. The proof of the second inequality given in [\cite=P] works in the non-symmetric case.) They yield

[formula]

and

[formula]

where R(K) and r(K) are the circumradius and the inradius of K respectively.

Since every isotropic convex body verifies R(K)  ≤  (n + 1)LK and r(K)  ≥  LK (see [\cite=G] or [\cite=KLS], for instance) we obtain

[formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=AlonsoMP]. Since [formula] we have

[formula]

where the first equivalence is the corresponding one for sections of convex bodies as proved in [\cite=MP].[formula]
