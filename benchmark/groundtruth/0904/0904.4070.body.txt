On Limit theorems in JW- algebras

Introduction.

The concept of almost everywhere convergence and its different variants for sequences in von Neumann algebra were studied by many authors (see for example, [\cite=J] [\cite=L] [\cite=P]). There were proved many limit and ergodic theorems with respect to almost everywhere convergence in such algebras with faithful normal state [\cite=Ba] [\cite=G] [\cite=Y]. In [\cite=HJP], a notion of bundle convergence in a von Neumann algebra was firstly defined which coincides with usual almost everywhere convergence in the case of commutative algebra L∞. Certain limit theorems with respect to such a convergence were obtained there. Other several results concerning the bundle convergence in a von Neumann algebra and in its L2-space were studied in [\cite=BF1] [\cite=BF2] [\cite=S].

On the other hand, in most mathematical formulations of the foundations of quantum mechanics, the bounded observables of a physical system are identified with a real linear space, L, of bounded self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H. Those bounded observables which correspond to the projections in L form a complete orthomodular lattice, P, otherwise known as the lattice of the quantum logic of the physical system. For the self-adjoint operators x and y on H their Jordan product is defined by [formula]. Thus [formula] is self-adjoint so it is reasonable to assume that L is a Jordan algebra of self-adjoint operators on H which is closed in the weak operator topology. Hence L is a JW-algebra. It is known that the JW- algebra is a real non-associative analog of a von Neumann algebra that firstly studied by Topping [\cite=T]. He had extended many results from the theory of von Neumann algebras on JW- algebras. Particulary, in [\cite=A2], a problem of extension of states and traces from JW- algebra to its enveloping von Neumann algebra was solved. In [\cite=A3], concepts of convergence in measure, almost uniformly convergence and convergence s-almost uniformly in JW-algebras were introduced, and relations between them were investigated as well. Such kinds of convergence are used to prove various ergodic theorems for Markov operators [\cite=A1] [\cite=A4] [\cite=A51] [\cite=K] [\cite=KM1]. Asymptotic behavior of positive contractions of Jordan algebras has been studied in [\cite=MTA] [\cite=MTA2]. We refer the reader to the books [\cite=A5] [\cite=ARU] [\cite=HS] for the theory of JW-algebras.

The main purposes of this paper is to extend a concept of the bundle convergence from von Neumann algebras to JW-algebras and prove certain limit theorems. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we recall some well-known facts and basic definitions from the theory of Jordan and von Neumann algebras. In section 3, the bundle convergence and its properties are studied. It is proved that the bundle limit of a sequence of uncorrelated operators is proportional to the identity operator. In the last section 4, certain properties of conditional expectations of a reversible JW- algebra A with a faithful normal trace are studied, and a martingale convergence theorem is proved as well. Here, we apply a method passing from Jordan algebra to the corresponding enveloping von Neumann algebra [\cite=K]. Note that supermartingales and martingales in a von Neumann algebra setting were investigated in [\cite=Br] [\cite=G] [\cite=J].

Preliminaries

Throughout the paper H denotes a complex Hilbert space, B(H) denotes the algebra of all bounded linear operators on H.

Recall that a JW-algebra is a real linear space of self-adjoint operators from B(H) which is closed under the Jordan product [formula] and also closed in the weak operator topology. Here the sign ab denotes the usual operator multiplication of operators a and b taken from B(H). A JW- algebra A is said to be reversible if [formula], whenever [formula]. Examples of non-reversible JW-algebras are spin factors which are described in [\cite=T] [\cite=ARU].

Recall that a real *  -algebra R in B(H) is called a real W*-algebra if it is closed in the weak operator topology and satisfies the conditions [formula], [formula]. It is obvious that if R is a real or complex W*-algebra, then its selfadjoint part Rsa  =  {x∈R:x*  =  x} forms a reversible JW-algebra.

Given an arbitrary JW-algebra A let R(A) denote the weakly closed real *  -algebra in B(H) generated by A, and let W(A) denote the W*- algebra (complex) generated by A.

[\cite=HS] Let A be a reversible JW-algebra, then the following assertions hold

R(A)sa = A and W(A) = R(A) + iR(A);

[formula] for every a,b∈R(A);

if [formula] for a,b∈R(A), then a  ≥  0.

Throughout the paper we always assume that a JW-algebra A is reversible, therefore we do not stress on it, if it is not necessary.

Let A be a reversible JW- algebra and ρ be a faithful normal (f.n.) state (resp. faithful normal semifinite (f.n.s.) trace) on A. Then ρ can be extended to a f.n. state ρ1 (resp. f.n.s. trace) on the W*-algebra W(A). Namely, for every x∈W(A)+ (W+ means the positive part of W), one has x = a + ib, where a,b∈R(A), a∈A+, b* =  - b (skew-symmetric element). Then, one puts ρ1(x) = ρ(a) (see [\cite=ARU], Thm. 1.2.9 for more details).

Let A be a JW- algebra with a f.n.s. trace τ and τ1 be its extension to W(A). Set [formula], [formula]. Completion of [formula] (resp. [formula]) w.r.t. the norm [formula]  [formula] (resp. [formula]  [formula]) is denoted by L1(A,τ) (resp. L1(W(A),τ1)). It is obvious that L1(A,τ)  ⊂  L1(W(A),τ1).

Let W be a von Neumann algebra with a f.n. state ρ. By ProjW we denote the set of all projections in W.

We recall some facts about almost uniformly convergence.

A sequence {xn}  ⊂  W is said to be almost uniformly convergent to x∈W ([formula]) if, for each ε > 0, there exists p∈ProjW with [formula] such that [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Further, we need the following

[\cite=J] For a uniformly bounded sequence, almost uniformly convergence implies strong convergence.

Now we give some necessary definition and results from [\cite=HJP].

Suppose that {Dm}  ⊂  W+ with [formula]. The bundle (determined by the sequence {Dm}) is the set

[formula]

Let xn,x∈W [formula]. We say that {xn} is bundle convergent to x ([formula]) if there exists a bundle P(Dm) with [formula] such that p∈P(Dm) implies [formula]

[\cite=HJP] Let 0 < ε < 1 / 16, Dm∈W+  [formula] and

[formula]

Then there exists p∈Proj W such that

[formula]

The bundle convergence in JW- algebras

In this section, we study bundle convergence and its properties in JW-algebras. We shall prove that the bundle limit of a sequence of uncorrelated operators is proportional to the identity operator. Throughout the paper A denotes a reversible JW- algebra.

Let A be a JW- algebra with a f.n. state ρ and ρ1 be its extension to the enveloping von Neumann algebra W(A).

Suppose that {Dm}  ⊂  A+ with [formula] The bundle is the set

[formula]

Let {Dm}∞m = 1  ⊂  A+, [formula]. Then P({Dm}∞m = 1)  =  P({Dm}∞m = k) and in the definition of bundle we may suppose that  [formula], for some positive number ε.

Let xn, x∈A [formula] We say that {xn} is bundle convergent to x ([formula]) if there exists a bundle P(Dm) such that p∈P(Dm) implies [formula]

Clearly, an intersection of two bundles is a bundle as well. Consequently, the bundle convergence in A is additive, and the bundle limit in A is unique. In the case when A is a self-adjoint part of some von Neumann algebra, bundle convergence in Jordan algebra coincides with convergence in a von Neumann algebra setting.

Similarly, one can define that a sequence {xn}  ⊂  A is said to be almost uniformly convergent to x∈A ([formula]) if, for each ε > 0, there exists p∈ProjA with [formula] such that [formula] as n  →    ∞   [\cite=A3].

In what follows we need the following auxiliary result.

Let σ,δ > 0, D∈A+ and suppose p∈ProjW(A) with [formula] such that [formula]. Then there exists a projection E∈ProjA with [formula] such that [formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=2.8] and [\ref=pdp] one gets the following

Let 0 < ε < 1 / 16, Dm∈A+  [formula] and

[formula]

Then there exists E∈ProjA such that

[formula]

For each bundle P(Dm) (with Dm∈A+ and [formula]) and for each ε > 0 there exists p∈P(Dm) such that [formula]

Obviously, this corollary implies the following

If [formula] then [formula].

Let {xn} be uniformly bounded and [formula] in A, x∈A, then xn  →  x in the strong operator topology.

Indeed, let xn, x∈A, then we obviously have [formula] in W(A). From Lemma [\ref=2.6] we derive that xn  →  x in the strong operator topology, i.e. for every ξ∈H [formula].

Let {xn}  ⊂  A and [formula]. Then [formula].

Let A be a reversible JW-algebra with f.n. state ρ, and ρ1 be its extension to the enveloping von Neumann algebra W(A). If a sequence (xn)  ⊂  A is bundle convergent in (W(A);ρ1), then it is bundle convergent in (A;ρ).

As a consequence of the last result we have the following result.

Let A be a reversible JW-algebra with f.n. state ρ, and ρ1 be its extension to the enveloping von Neumann algebra W(A). Suppose that {xn} is a sequence of pairwise orthogonal operators in A (i.e. [formula] for i  ≠  j). If

[formula]

then [formula].

We have the following

Let xn, x∈A [formula],  and  [formula]   then [formula]

Recall that the covariance of two operators a,b∈A is defined by [formula] the variance of a is defined by [formula] If cov(a,b) = 0, then a and b are called uncorrelated.

Let A be a reversible JW-algebra, acting on Hilbert space H, with f.n. state ρ. Suppose that {xn} is a sequence of uncorrelated operators in A, and the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]   (x∈A),

[formula]

Then there exists a complex number c such that [formula], where, as before, [formula] is the identity in A.

Note that if instead of a state ρ one takes f.n. finte trace, then (i) assumption could be replaced with [formula]. Note that, in general, such a result might not valid, since a.u. convergence is not additive (see [\cite=Pa]).

Conditional expectation in JW- algebras.

In this section, certain properties of conditional expectations of reversible JW- algebras are studied. Using such properties prove a main result of this section, formulated in Theorem [\ref=4.8], which is a Jordan analog of the following result:

[\cite=Br] Let W be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal semifinite trace τ. Let {xα} be a supermartingale in L1(W,τ). If [formula] is weakly relatively compact, then there is an x∈L1(W,τ) such that [formula] in L1(W,τ).

Let A be a reversible JW- algebra with a f.n.s. trace τ. Let A1 be its JW- subalgebra containing the identity operator [formula].

Recall that a linear mapping φ:A  →  A1 is called a conditional expectation with respect to a JW- subalgebra A1 if the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

If x  ≥  0, then φ(x)  ≥  0;

φ(xy) = φ(x)y for x∈A, y∈A1.

Let [formula] be the restriction of the trace τ to A1 such that [formula] is also semifinite. Then the space [formula] of integrable operators w.r.t. [formula], is a subspace of L1(A,τ).

[\cite=Ber] Let A be a reversible JW- algebra with a f.n.s trace τ and A1 be its JW- subalgebra with [formula]. Let [formula] be the restriction of the trace τ to A1 such that [formula] is also semifinite. Then there exists a unique positive linear mapping E(  ·   / A1):A  →  A1 satisfying the condition

[formula]

for a∈A, [formula], and the mapping E(  ·   / A1) is a conditional expectation with respect to A1.

Such a conditional expectation is called τ  -   invariant. Note that when trace is finite an analogous result has been proved in [\cite=A4]. In what follows E(  ·   / A1) and its extension to L1(A,τ) is called a conditional expectation w.r.t. A1 [\cite=Ber].

We note that if W(A) is the enveloping von Neumann algebra of a JW-algebra A, then the existence of conditional expectations from W(A) onto A has been proved in [\cite=HaS].

Let A be a reversible JW- algebra with f.n.s. trace τ and τ1 be its extension to W(A). Further, we suppose that the restriction of τ to any considered subalgebras is semifinite. If B is a reversible JW- subalgebra of A, then we denote a conditional expectation with respect to B by E(  ·   / B). Similarly, a conditional expectation from W(A) to a subalgebra W(B) is denoted by [formula].

So let [formula] be a τ  -   invariant conditional expectation, i.e.

[formula]

which is uniqe (see [\cite=U] )

Let [formula], and z* =  - z, then τ1(z) = 0.

It is naturally to ask: how the restriction of [formula] to A is related to E(  ·   / B)? Next result answers to such a question.

The restriction of τ  -   invariant conditional expectation [formula] to A is equal to E(  ·   / B), here as before E(  ·   / B) is τ  -   invariant conditional expectation.

Suppose that [formula] is a family of reversible JW- subalgebras of A containing the identity operator [formula] such that the set [formula] is weak dense in A.

Note that when we replace ≤   with the equality sign, then the family [formula] is called martingale. If in Definition [\ref=4.6], as a JW-algebra A, we take self-adjoint part of a von Neumman algebra W, then we get usual definitions of supermartingale and martingale, respectively, in a von Neumann algebra setting.

It is known [\cite=A5] that (L1(W,τ1))* = W, (L1(A,τ))* = A, and therefore by σW  =  σW(L1(W,τ1),W), σA  =  σA(L1(A,τ),A) we denote weak topologies on L1(W,τ1), L1(A,τ), respectively. Note that σW (resp. σA) is generated by a family of seminorms Pa(x) = |τ1(ax)|, a∈W (resp. [formula]).

Let A be a reversible JW-algebra with a f.n.s trace τ. Then one has σW(A)|L1(A,τ)  =  σA.

Now we are ready to prove a main result of this section.

Let [formula] be a supermartingale in L1(A,τ). If the set [formula] is weakly relatively compact in L1(A,τ), then there is x∈L1(A,τ) such that [formula] in L1 norm.

Note that when the family [formula] is martingale, the similar result was proved in [\cite=Ber], therefore, our result extends the mentioned one. When the trace is finite a similar result was studied in [\cite=A4] [\cite=A51]
