Introduction.

In [\cite=tu1] and [\cite=tu2], V. Turaev introduced the theory of topology of words and phrases. Words are finite sequences of letters in a given alphabet, letters are elements of an alphabet and phrases are finite sequences of words. Turaev defined generalized words which is called étale words as follows : Let α be an alphabet endowed with an involution τ:α  →  α. Let A be an alphabet endowed with a mapping |  ·  |:A  →  α which is called a projection. We call this A an α-alphabet. Then we call a pair an α-alphabet A and a word on A an étale word. If all letters in A appear exactly twice, then we call this étale word a nanoword.

Turaev introduced an equivalence relation which is called homotopy on nanowords. This equivalence relation is suggested by the Reidemeister moves in the theory of knots. Homotopy of nanowords is generated by isomorphism, and three homotopy moves. The first homotopy move is deformation that changes xAAy into xy. The second homotopy move is deformation that changes xAByBAz into xyz when |A| is equal to τ(|B|). The third homotopy move is deformation that changes xAByACzBCt into xBAyCAzCBt when |A| and |B| are equal to |C| (Turaev defined more generalized equivalence relation which is called S-homotopy. However, in this paper, we treat only homotopy). Turaev defined homotopy of étale words via desingularization of étale words. Moreover in [\cite=tu2] Turaev defined homotopy of nanophrase in a similar manner.

Theory of words and phrases is applied for studying curves on surfaces. In [\cite=ga] C. F. Gauss studied planar curves via words. Turaev applied generalized words and phrases for curves and knot diagrams. Turaev showed special cases of the theory of topology of phrases corresponds to the theory of stable equivalent classes of ordered, pointed, oriented multi-component curves on surfaces and knot diagrams. Note that the theory stable equivalence classes of ordered, pointed, oriented multi-component curves on surfaces (respectively knot diagrams) is equivalent to the theory of ordered open flat virtual links (respectively ordered open virtual links). In this paper, ordered links means each components of links are numerated. See also [\cite=kad], [\cite=ka], [\cite=sw] and [\cite=tu5] for more details. In this meaning, the theory of topology of words and phrases is combinational extension of the theory of virtual knots and links.

Now the purpose of this paper is classification of generalized phrases (in this paper we call it étale phrases) up to homotopy. Turaev gave the homotopy classification of étale words with less than or equal to five letters in [\cite=tu1]. We will extend this result. More precisely, in this paper, we give the classification of étale phrases with less than or equal to three letters. To do this we use some known invariants which was introduced in [\cite=fu1], [\cite=fu2] and [\cite=gi]. Moreover we construct a new homotopy invariant.

The rest of this paper is constructed as follows. In the next section we review the theory of topology of nanowords, étale words, nanophrases and étale phrases. In Section 3 we introduce homotopy invariants of nanophrases which was introduced in [\cite=fu1], [\cite=fu2] and [\cite=gi]. Then we will define a new homotopy invariant for nanophrases. In Section 4 and Section 5 we give the classification of étale phrases with less than or equal to three letters without the condition on length of phrases.

Étale Phrases and Nanophrases.

In this section we introduce Turaev's theory of words and phrases (See [\cite=tu1], [\cite=tu2] and [\cite=tu3] for more details).

Étale words and étale phrases.

In this paper an alphabet means a finite set and letters mean its element. A word of length n on an alphabet A is a mapping w:n̂  →  A where [formula] and a phrase of length k on A is a finite sequence of words on A, [formula]. A multiplicity of a letter A∈A in a phrase P on A is a number of A in the phrase P. We denote multiplicity of A∈A by mP(A).

Let α be an alphabet endowed with an involution τ:α  →  α. An α-alphabet is a pair (An alphabet A, mapping |  ·  |:A  →  α). We call the mapping |  ·  | projection.

In [\cite=tu5], V. Turaev defined generalized words which is called étale words. An étale word over α is a pair (An α-alphabet A, A word on A) and A étale phrase over α is a pair (An α-alphabet A, A phrase on A).

Turaev did not define étale phrases explicitly. However Turaev considered an equivalent object in [\cite=tu2].

A phrase P on an α gives rise to an étale phrase (α,P) where the projection α  →  α is the identity mapping. In this meaning étale phrases are generalization of usual phrases.

Nanowords and nanophrases.

A Gauss word on an alphabet A is a word w on A which all letters in A appear exactly twice in w. A phrase P on A is called a Gauss phrase if all letters in A appear exactly twice in P.

In this paper, we consider generalized Gauss words and Gauss phrases. A nanoword over α is a pair (An α-alphabet A, A Gauss word on A) and A nanophrase over α is a pair (An α-alphabet A, A Gauss phrase on A). Instead of writing (A,P) for a nanophrase over α, we often write simply P. The alphabet A can be uniquely recovered. However the projection |  ·  |:A  →  α should be always specified.

Desingularization of étale phrases.

In this section, we introduce a method of associating with any étale phrases over α (A,P) a nanophrase over α (Ad,Pd) which is called desingularization of étale phrases.

Let Ad be an α-alphabet {Ai,j: = (A,i,j)|A∈A,1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  mP(A)} with the projection |Ai,j|: = |A| for all Ai,j. The phrase Pd is obtained from P by first deleting all A∈A with mP(A) is less than or equal to one. Then for each A∈A with mP(A) is grater than or equal to two and each [formula], we replace the i-th entry of A in P by

[formula]

The resulting (Ad,Pd) is a nanophrase with [formula] letters and called a desingularization of (A,P). Note that if (A,P) is a nanophrase, then desingularization of (A,P) is a itself.

Homotopy of nanophrases and étale phrases.

In [\cite=tu1] and [\cite=tu2], Turaev defined an equivalence relation which is called homotopy on a set of nanophrases and étale words.

To define homotopy, we define isomorphism of étale phrases. A morphism of α-alphabets A1, A2 is a set-theoric mapping f:A1  →  A2 such that |A| = |f(A)| for all A∈A1. If f is bijective, then this morphism is an isomorphism. Two étale phrases [formula] and [formula] over α are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism f:A1  →  A2 such that [formula] for all j∈.

Next we define homotopy moves of nanophrases.

We define homotopy moves (1) - (3) of nanophrases as follows:

(1) [formula]

for all A∈A and x,y are sequences of letters in [formula], possibly including

the | character.

(2) [formula]

if A,B∈A satisfy |B|  =  τ(|A|). x,y,z are sequences of letters in [formula],

possibly including | character.

(3) (A,(xAByACzBCt))  →  (A,(xBAyCAzCBt))

if A,B,C∈A satisfy |A| = |B| = |C|. x,y,z,t are sequences of letters in

A, possibly including | character.

Now we define homotopy of étale phrases.

Two étale phrases (A1,P1) and (A2,P2) over α are homotopic (denoted (A1,P1)≃(A2,P2)) if ((A2)d,(P2)d) can be obtained from ((A1)d,(P1)d) by a finite sequence of isomorphism, homotopy moves (1) - (3) and the inverse of moves (1) - (3).

By the definition of homotopy of étale phrases, every homotopy invariant I of nanophrases extends to a homotopy invariant I of étale phrases by I(P): = I(Pd).

The gale of this paper is to classify étale phrases of length k over α with less than or equal to three letters up to homotopy for any k and α.

The case of k is equal to one (in other words, the case of étale words) Turaev gave the classification as follows.

A multiplicity-one-free word of length less than or equal to four in the alphabet α has one of the following forms: aa, aaa, aaaa, aabb, abba, abab with distinct a,b∈α The words aa, aabb, abba are contractible. The words aaa and aaaa are contractible if and only if τ(a) = a. The word abab is contractible if and only if τ(a) = b. Non-contractible words of type aaa, aaaa and abab are homotopic if and only if they are equal.

Homotopy Invariants of Nanophrases.

By the definition of homotopy of étale phrases, we need homotopy invariants of nanophrases. In this section, we introduce homotopy invariants of nanophrases which were defined in [\cite=fu1], [\cite=fu2] and [\cite=gi]. Moreover we define a new homotopy invariant of nanophrases.

Simple invariants.

In this subsection, we review homotopy invariants which were defined in [\cite=fu2] and [\cite=gi].

Let [formula] be a nanophrase over α. For l∈, we define [formula] by the length of wl. We call the vector

[formula]

the component length vector.

The component length vector is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases.

Next we define another homotopy invariant. Let π be the group which is defined as follows:

[formula]

Let [formula] be a nanophrase of length k over α. We define lP(i,j)∈π for i  <  j by

[formula]

We call a vector [formula] the linking vector.

The linking vector of nanophrases is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases.

The invariant T.

In this section we introduce a homotopy invariant T which was defined by the author in [\cite=fu1]. This invariant is defined for nanophrases over α0 and the one-element set where α0  =  {a,b} with the involution τ0:a  ↦  b.

Let [formula] be a nanophrase over α0 and A,B∈A. Then we define σP(A,B) as follows: If A and B form [formula] in P and |B| = a, or [formula] in P and |B| = b, then σP(A,B): = 1. If [formula] in P and |B| = b, or [formula] in P and |B| = a, then σP(A,B): =  - 1. Otherwise σP(A,B): = 0.

For A∈A we define ε(A)∈{  ±  1} by

[formula]

Let [formula] be a nanophrase of length k over α0. For A∈A such that there exist [formula] such that Card(w- 1i(A)) = 2, we define [formula] by

[formula]

and we define [formula] by

[formula]

Then we define [formula] by

[formula]

T is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases over α0.

Next we define an invariant T for nanophrases over the one-element set (we use the same notation "T" because of the Remark [\ref=rem1]).

Let [formula] be a nanophrase over the one-element set α: = {a}. Let A,B∈A be letters. Then we define [formula] as follows: If A and B forms [formula] or [formula] in P, then σ̃P(A,B): = 1. Otherwise σ̃P(A,B): = 0.

Let [formula] be a nanophrase over α: = {a}. For A∈A such that there exist an [formula] such that Card(w- 1i(A)) = 2, we define [formula] by

[formula]

and [formula] by

[formula]

Then we define [formula] by

[formula]

Then the next theorem follows.

T is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases over the one-element set.

In a preprint [\cite=fu2], the author extended the invariant T to nanophrases over any α. However in this paper we only use this invariant for nanophrases over α0 and nanophrases over the one element set.

The invariant So.

In [\cite=gi] A.Gibson defined a homotopy invariant of nanophrases over the one-element set which is stronger than the invariant T for nanophrases over the one-element set. In this subsection we introduce Gibson's So invariant.

First we define some notations. Let [formula] be a nanophrase over the one-element set. For a letter A∈Ai: = {A∈A|Card(w- 1i(A)) = 2}, we define [formula] as follows : When we write P as xAyAz where x, y and z are words in A possibly including "|" character, lj(A) is modulo 2 of the number of letters which appear exactly once in y and once in the j-th component of the phrase P. Then we define [formula] by

[formula]

Let v be a vector in [formula]. Then we define [formula] by

[formula]

and we define [formula] by

[formula]

Then we define the [formula] by

[formula]

So is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases over the one-element set.

The invariant UL.

In this section we introduce a new invariant of nanophrases.

First we prepare some notations. Since the set α is a finite set, we obtain following orbit decomposition of the τ : [formula], where : = {aij,τ(aij)} such that Card() = 2 for all [formula] and Card() = 1 for all [formula] (we fix a complete representative system [formula] which satisfy the above condition). Let L be a subset of crs(α  /  τ). For a nanophrase (A,P) over α, we define a nanophrase UL((A,P)) over [formula] as follows: deleting all letters A∈A such that [formula] from both A and P.

UL is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases.

First, isomorphism does not change UL(P) up to isomorphic is clear.

Consider the first homotopy move

[formula]

where x and y are words on A, possibly including "|" character. Suppose [formula]. Then

[formula]

where xL and yL are words which obtained by deleting all letters X∈A such that [formula] from x and y respectively.

Suppose [formula]. Then

[formula]

So the first homotopy move does not change the homotopy class of UL(P).

Consider the second homotopy move

[formula]

where |A| = τ(|B|), and x, y and z are words on A possibly including "|" character. Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] since |A| = τ(|B|). So

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] since |A| = τ(|B|). So

[formula]

By the above, the second homotopy move does not change the homotopy class of UL(P).

Consider the third homotopy move

[formula]

where |A| = |B| = |C|, and x, y, z and t are words on A possibly including "|" character. Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] since |A| = |B| = |C|. So we obtain

[formula]

Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] since |A| = |B| = |C|. So we obtain

[formula]

So the third homotopy move does not change the homotopy class of UL(P).

By the above, UL is a homotopy invariant of nanophrases.

Homotopy Classification of Étale Phrases.

In this section we classify étale phrases with less than or equal to three letters up to homotopy. First we recall lemmas in [\cite=fu1].

Let β be τ-invariant subset of α. If two nanophrases over β are homotopic in the class of nanophrases over α, then they are homotopic in the class of nanophrases over β.

Let [formula] and [formula] be nanophrases of length k over α. If P1 and P2 are homotopic as nanophrases, then wi and vi are homotopic as étale words for all [formula].

Next we prepare some notations. Let α be an alphabet endowed with an involution τ:α  →  α. Then we set [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], where a∈α and l, l1,l2,l3∈ with l1  <  l2  <  l3. Note that if a = τ(a), then P3;la is homotopic to the nanophrase [formula]. So when we use the notation P3;la, we always assume that a  ≠  τ(a).

For two different integers k1 and k2, an étale phrase of length k1 and an étale phrase of length k2 are not homotopic each other. So we do not write length of phrases in above notations.

Now we describe the main results of this paper.

Let P be a multiplicity-one-free étale phrase over α with less than or equal to three letters. Then P is either homotopic to [formula] or homotopic to one of the following étale phrases: P1,1;l1,l2a, P3;la, P2,1;l1,l2a, P1,2;l1,l2a, P1,1,1;l1,l2,l3a for some l1, l2, l3∈ and a∈α. Moreover P1,1;l1,l2a, P3;la, P2,1;l1,l2a, P1,2;l1,l2a, P1,1,1;l1,l2,l3a are homotopic if and only if they are equal.

To prove this theorem, we prepare following lemmas.

Étale phrases P1,1;l1,l2a, P3;la, P2,1;l1,l2a, P1,2;l1,l2a and P1,1,1;l1,l2,l3a are not homotopic to [formula].

If a is not equal to b, then PX1;Y1a and PX2;Y2b are not homotopic for all (X1;Y1),(X2;Y2)∈{(1,1;l1,l2),(3;l),(2,1;l1,l2),(1,2;l1,l2),(1,1,1;l1,l2,l3)}.

Two étale phrases PX1;Y1a and PX2;Y2a are homotopic if and only if (X1;Y1) is equal to (X2;Y2).

If we show above lemmas, then we obtain the main theorem. We prove these lemmas in the next section.

Proof of Lemmas.

In this section, we prove Lemma [\ref=lem1], Lemma [\ref=lem2] and Lemma[\ref=lem3].

Proof of the Lemma [\ref=lem1].

The first claim of this lemma is easily checked. We show the second part of the lemma. [formula] The case [formula].

In this case, component length vector

[formula]

where [formula]. On the other hand

[formula]

So we obtain [formula]. [formula] The case [formula].

By the Theorem [\ref=tu], a3 = aaa with a  ≠  τ(a) is not homotopic to empty nanoword [formula]. Combining this fact and Lemma [\ref=plem2], we obtain [formula]. [formula] The case [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=plem1], we can assume α  =  {a,τ(a)}. In this case

[formula]

(both the case a = τ(a) and the case a  ≠  τ(a)). So we obtain [formula]. [formula] The case [formula].

In this case

[formula]

(both the case a = τ(a) and the case a  ≠  τ(a)). So we obtain [formula]. [formula] The case [formula].

In this case

[formula]

Note that a is not equal to the unit element 1 in π. So we obtain [formula].

Now we finished prove the lemma.

Proof of the Lemma [\ref=lem2].

By Lemma [\ref=plem1], we can assume α  =  {a,τ(a),b,τ(b)}.

Suppose â  ≠  . Let crs(α  /  τ)  =  {a,b} and L  =  {a}. Then

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

So by Lemma [\ref=lem1], we obtain PX1;Y1a is not homotopic to PX2;Y2b for all (X1;Y1),(X2;Y2) ∈{(1,1;l1,l2),(3;l),(2,1;l1,l2),(1,2;l1,l2),(1,1,1;l1,l2,l3)}.

Suppose â  =  . By the assumption a is not equal to b, Card(â) = 2 and b = τ(a). [formula] On [formula].

In this case

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

So lP1,1;l1,l2a(l1,l2) is not equal to lP1,1;m1,m2τ(a)(l1,l2). So we obtain [formula]. [formula] On [formula] for all (X;Y)  ≠  (1,1;m1,m2).

In this case,

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we obtain [formula]. [formula] On [formula] for all (X;Y)  ≠  (1,1;m1,m2).

This is obtained from Theorem [\ref=tu] and Lemma [\ref=plem2]. [formula] On [formula] for all (X;Y)  ≠  (1,1;m1,m2),(3;m).

In this case,

[formula]

On the other hand

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we obtain [formula]. [formula] On [formula] for all (X;Y)  ≠  (1,1;m1,m2),(3;m),(2,1;m1,m2).

In this case,

[formula]

On the other hand

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we obtain [formula]. [formula] On [formula].

In this case

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we obtain [formula].

Now we have completed the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem2].

Proof of the Lemma [\ref=lem3].

[formula] On P1,1;l1,l2a.

In this case

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all (X;Y)  ≠  (1,1;m1,m2). So we obtain P1,1;l1,l2a≃PX;Ya if and only if (X;Y) = (1,1;l1,l2). [formula] On P3;la.

By Theorem [\ref=tu] and Lemma [\ref=plem2], We obtain P3;la≃PX;Ya if and only if (X;Y) = (3;l). [formula] On P2,1;l1,l2a.

The case [formula] if (l1,l2)  ≠  (m1,m2).

If a  ≠  τ(a), then

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we obtain [formula] if (l1,l2)  ≠  (m1,m2).

If a  =  τ(a), then by Lemma [\ref=plem1] we can assume α  =  {a}. So we can use Gibson's So invariant. In this case

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we obtain [formula] if (l1,l2)  ≠  (m1,m2).

The case [formula].

If a  ≠  τ(a) and (l1,l2)  ≠  (m1,m2), then

[formula]

and

[formula]

If a  ≠  τ(a) and (l1,l2)  =  (m1,m2), then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since l1 is not equal to l2,

[formula]

If a  =  τ(a), then

[formula]

and

[formula]

So if P2,1;l1,l2a≃P1,2;m1,m2a, then (l1,l2) = (m2,m1). However this contradict the assumption l1  <  l2 and m1  <  m2. By the above, we obtain [formula].

The case [formula].

In this case,

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

So we obtain lk(P2,1;l1,l2a)  ≠  lk(P1,1,1;m1,m2,m3a). This implies [formula]. [formula] On P1,2;l1,l2a.

This case proved similarly as the case on P2,1;l1,l2a. [formula] On P1,1,1;l1,l2,l3a.

In this case,

[formula]

So we obtain P1,1,1;l1,l2,l3a≃P1,1,1;m1,m2,m3a if and only if (l1,l2,l3) = (m1,m2,m3).

Now we have completed the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem3].
