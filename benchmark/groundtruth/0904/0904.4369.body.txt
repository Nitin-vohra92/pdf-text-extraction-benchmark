Scalar dark matter-Higgs coupling in the case of electroweak symmetry breaking driven by unparticle

Physics Department, Middle East Technical University Ankara, Turkey

Research aims to understand the nature of the dark matter reaches great interest since it contributes almost 23% of present Universe [\cite=JungmanG] [\cite=JungmanG2] [\cite=KomatsuE]. The existence of dark matter can not be explained in the framework of the standard model (SM) and, therefore, one needs to go beyond. There exist a number of dark matter candidates in various scenarios such as Supersymmetry, minimal Universal Extra Dimensions and Little Higgs with Tparity. It is believed that a large amount of dark matter is made of cold relics and they are in the class nonrelativistic cold dark matter. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are among such dark matter candidates with masses in the range 10 GeV- a few TeV. They are stable, interacting only through weak and gravitational interactions and disappearing by pair annihilation (see for example [\cite=DEramoF] [\cite=WanLeiGuo] for further discussion). From the theoretical point of view a chosen discrete symmetry drives the stability in many scenarios mentioned above .

In the present work we introduce an additional scalar SM singlet field φD, called as darkon, which was considered first by Silveria [\cite=SilveiraV] and studied by several authors [\cite=HolzE] [\cite=McDonaldJ] [\cite=PattB] [\cite=BertolamiO] [\cite=DavoudiaslG] [\cite=HeXG], and take the lagrangian obeying the Z2 symmetry φD  →    -  φD

[formula]

where Φ1 is the SM Higgs field and φD has no vacuum expectation value. The Z2 symmetry considered ensures that the darkon field can appear as pairs and they are stable in the sense that they do not decay into any other SM particles. They can disappear by annihilating as pairs into SM particles with the help of the exchange particle(s). Now, we will introduce an electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and study its effect on the Darkon annihilation cross section.

A possible hidden sector beyond the SM can be among the candidates to explain this breaking. Such a hidden sector has been proposed by Georgi [\cite=Georgi1] [\cite=Georgi2] as a hypothetical scale invariant one with non-trivial infrared fixed point. It is beyond the SM at high energy level and it comes out as new degrees of freedom, called unparticles, being massless and having non integral scaling dimension du. The interaction(s) of unparticle with the SM field(s) in the low energy level is defined by the effective lagrangian (see for example [\cite=SChen]). The possibility of the electroweak symmetry breaking due to the mixing between the unparticle and the Higgs boson has been introduced in [\cite=JPLee] (see also [\cite=Kikuchi2]). In [\cite=JPLee] the idea was based on the interaction of the SM scalar sector with the unparticle operator in the form [formula] where Φ is the SM scalar and OU is the unparticle operator with mass dimension du (see [\cite=Rajaraman] [\cite=ADelgado] [\cite=ADelgado2] [\cite=Feng] [\cite=Kikuchi] [\cite=RZwicky]). By using the fact that unparticles look like a number of du massless particles with mass dimension one and, therefore, the operator Ou can be considered in the form of [formula], the interaction term

[formula]

is induced and it drives the electroweak symmetry breaking in the tree level [\cite=JPLee]. Recently, in [\cite=Iltanmuonanogunp], this idea has been applied to the extended scalar sector which was obtained by introducing a shadow Higgs one, the complex scalar φ2 in addition to the SM Higgs. This choice leads to a richer scalar spectrum which appears as three scalars, the SM Higgs hI, hII and the heavy hIII, after the mixing mechanism (see Appendix for a brief explanation of the toy model used.). These three scalars are the exchange particles in our analysis and we have the annihilation process φD  φD  →  hI  (hII,  hIII)  →  XSM. The total averaging annihilation rate of φD  φD reads

[formula]

where [formula] with virtual Higgs h̃ having mass 2  mD (see [\cite=BirdC] [\cite=BirdC2]). Here vr is the average relative speed of two darkons, [formula] with center of mass momentum pCM. The total annihilation rate can be restricted by using the present dark matter (DM) abundance. The WMAP collaboration [\cite=WAMP] provides a precise determination of the present DM abundance (at two sigma level) as

[formula]

Finally, by using the expression which connects the annihilation cross section to the relic density

[formula]

with xf  ~  25 (see for example [\cite=JungmanG2] [\cite=HeXG] [\cite=ServantG] [\cite=Gopalakrishna] [\cite=Gopalakrishna2]) one gets the bounds

[formula]

which of the order of (1 - 2)  ×  10- 9  GeV- 2. This is the case that s-wave annihilation is dominant (see [\cite=KolbEW] for details.). Discussion In the present work we extend the scalar sector by considering a shadow Higgs one with complex scalar and in order to achieve the electroweak symmetry breaking at tree level we assume that the unparticle sector, proposed by Georgi [\cite=Georgi1], couples to both scalars. Furthermore we introduce so called darkon field, which is a SM singlet with vanishing vacuum expectation value and it couples to the SM Higgs doublet, with coupling λD. After the symmetry breaking considered in our toy model the tree level interaction DDh appears with strength v0λD and this coupling is responsible for the annihilation cross section which agrees with the present observed dark matter relic density (eq.([\ref=RelDens])).

Here we study the dependence of coupling λD to the parameters of the model used, the Darkon mass, the scale dimension du and the parameter s0. In our calculations we take the Darkon mass in the range of 10  ≤  mD  ≤  80 and use the central value of the annihilation cross section, namely   <  σ  vr >  = 0.8  pb. Notice that in the toy model we consider there exist three intermediate scalars which appear after the mixing and they drive the annihilation process with different couplings.

In Fig.[\ref=LambDmsdu11b] we plot mD dependence of λD for du = 1.1. Here the solid-long dashed-dashed-dotted line represents λD for mI = 110  GeV, s0 = 0.1-mI = 110  GeV, s0 = 0.5-mI = 120  GeV, s0 = 0.1-mI = 120  GeV, s0 = 0.5. λD is of the order of 0.1 for the small values of mD, mD  ≤  30  GeV, and for the range mD  ≥  70  GeV, in the case that the mass mI is restricted to mI = 110  GeV and 120  GeV. In the intermediate region λD drops and increases drastically. Since there exist three intermediate particles, at the values of mD which satisfies the equalities [formula] ( i = I,II,III), λD decreases to reach the appropriate annihilation cross section which is compatible with the current relic density. In the figure we have two small values of λD for each set of mD,  du and s0 due to resonant annihilations and the third one is out of the chosen mD range which does not include the mass values of the order of [formula]. On the other hand λD increases up to the values 0.5 due to the effects of possible interferences of intermediate scalar propagators. The figure shows that increasing mass of mI result in a shift of λD curve and, for its increasing values, λD increases (decreases) for light (heavy) Darkon in order to satisfy the observed relic abundance. Fig.[\ref=LambDmsdu15b] is the same as Fig.[\ref=LambDmsdu11b] but for du = 1.5. It is observed that there is an considerable enhancement in the coupling λD for the some intermediate values of mD and first suppressed value(s) of λD appears for lighter mD compared to case of du = 1.1. This is due to the fact that the mass mII becomes lighter with the increasing values of du and the resonant annihilation occurs for a lighter Darkon mass.

Now we study du and s0 dependence of the coupling λD to understand their effect on the annihilation rate more clear.

In Fig.[\ref=LambDdus001] we present du dependence of λD for s0 = 0.1. Here the solid-long dashed-dashed-dotted-dash dotted line represents λD for mI = 110  GeV, mD = 20  GeV-mI = 120  GeV, mD = 20  GeV-mI = 110  GeV, mD = 30  GeV-mI = 120  GeV, mD = 30  GeV-mI = 110  GeV, mD = 60  GeV. It is observed that for heavy Darkon λD is not sensitive to du. For the light Darkon particle case λD is sensitive to du around the numerical values which the threshold [formula] are reached.

Fig.[\ref=LambDs0du15] represents s0 dependence of λD for du = 1.5. Here the solid-long dashed-dashed-dotted-dash dotted line represents λD for mI = 110  GeV, mD = 20  GeV-mI = 120  GeV, mD = 20  GeV-mI = 110  GeV, mD = 70  GeV-mI = 120  GeV, mD = 70  GeV-mI = 110  GeV, mD = 60  GeV. This figure shows that for light (heavy) Darkon λD decreases (increases) with increasing values of s0 since the increase in s0 causes that the masses mII and mIII become lighter. With the decrease in mass mII mD reaches [formula] and the resonant annihilation occurs for light Darkon. For the heavy one, mD becomes far from [formula] as s0 decreases and the annihilation rate becomes small.

In summary, we consider that the electroweak symmetry breaking at tree level occurs with the interaction of the SM Higgs doublet, the hidden scalar and the hidden unparticle sector. Furthermore we introduce an additional scalar SM singlet stable field φD, which is a dark matter candidate. This scalar disappears by annihilating as pairs into SM particles with the help of the exchange scalars, appearing after the electroweak symmetry breaking and the mixing. By respecting the annihilation rate which does not contradict with the current relic density, we predict the tree level coupling λD which drives the annihilation process. We see that the unparticle scaling du and the parameter s0 play considerable role on the annihilation and, therefore, on the coupling λD. Once the dark matter mass mD is fixed by the dark matter search experiments, it would be possible to understand the mechanism behind the possible annihilation process and one could get considerable information about the electroweak symmetry breaking. Appendix Here we would like to present briefly (see [\cite=Iltanmuonanogunp] for details) the possible mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking coming from the coupling of unparticle and the scalar sector of the toy model used. The scalar potential which is responsible for the unparticle-neutral scalars mixing reads:

[formula]

where μ is the parameter inserted in order to make the couplings λ2 and [formula] dimensionless. In order to find the minimum of the potential V along the ray Φi  =  ρ  Ni with Φi = (Φ1,φ2,φ) (see [\cite=Weinberg])

[formula]

in unitary gauge, and the potential V

[formula]

the stationary condition [formula] along a special [formula] direction should be calculated. Finally, one gets the minimum values of Ni, namely ni as

[formula]

where

[formula]

for [formula] which we consider in our calculations. By using eq.([\ref=n01]), the nontrivial minimum value of the potential is obtained as

[formula]

This is the case that the minimum of the potential is nontrivial, namely V(ρ,ni)  ≠  0 for 1 < du < 2, without the need for CW mechanism (see [\cite=Weinberg] for details of CW mechanism). The stationary condition fixes the parameter ρ as,

[formula]

and one gets

[formula]

by using the eq.([\ref=n01]) with the help of the restriction

[formula]

Here the restriction in eq.([\ref=restr22]) arises when one chooses du = 2 in the stationary conditions.

Now, we study the mixing matrix of the scalars under consideration. The expansion of the fields Φ1, φ2 and φ around the vacuum

[formula]

results in the potential (eq. ([\ref=potential]))

[formula]

and the mass matrix [formula] with [formula] as

[formula]

with eigenvalues

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here we used the parametrization

[formula]

The physical states hI,  hII,  hIII are connected to the original states [formula] as

[formula]

where cα  (η) = cos  α  (η), sα  (η) = sin  α  (η) and

[formula]

When du  →  2, the state hII is massless in the tree level and it has the lightest mass for 1 < du  <  2. hI and hIII can be identified as the SM Higgs boson and heavy scalar coming from the shadow sector, respectively.

The final restriction is constructed by fixing the vacuum expectation value v0 = n0  ρ0, by the gauge boson mass mW as

[formula]

where GF is the Fermi constant. By using eqs. ([\ref=n01]) and ([\ref=rhorestr]) we get

[formula]

with [formula]. The choice of the parameter μ around weak scale as μ = v0 results in the additional restriction which connects parameters s0 and s10 (see eq. ([\ref=hatv02]) by considering 20 = 1) as

[formula]

When du  →  2, [formula] and when du  →  1, [formula]. It is shown that the ratios are of the order of one and the choice μ = v0 is reasonable (see [\cite=JPLee] for the similar discussion.)
