Decomposable and atomic projection maps

Introduction

The classification theory for positive linear maps between C*  -  algebras has been progressing slowly since Stinepring [\cite=St] introduced the class of completely positive maps in 1955. Even in the simple case when both C*  -  algebras are the complex 3  ×  3 matrices [formula], the classification problem is still open. So far main emphasis has been on completely positive maps, copositive maps, i.e. those which are the composition of a completely positive map and an anti-automorphism, or more generally, k-positive maps, which are maps φ such that [formula] is positive, where ιk is the identity on [formula], and the corresponding k-copositive maps. These maps are reasonably well understood, see e.g. [\cite=SSZ]. Furthermore maps which are sums of completely positive maps and copositive maps, called decomposable maps, and those which are not, called nondecomposable maps, have attracted much attention.

A more general class of which we have a reasonably good understanding is the cone of (k,m)-decomposable maps, which are those which are the sum of a k-positive and an m-copositive map, including the case when one of them is the zero map. They are all contained in the cone of (2,2)-decomposable maps. It is thus natural to consider maps which are not (2,2)-decomposable, called atomic in the literature. It was shown by Ha [\cite=H] that the natural generalizations of the Choi map [\cite=Cho] are atomic. In the present paper we shall show that trace preserving projection maps are atomic if and only if they are nondecomposable. In [\cite=S2] it was shown that the projetion maps onto spin factors of dimension greater than 6 are nondecomposable, hence we obtain atomic maps in arbitrary large dimensions. We shall at the end apply the above results to give a sufficient condition for a positive map to be be atomic, in terms of algebraic properties of its fixed point set.

Atomic projection maps

If B is a unital C*  -  algebra a positive linear map P:B  →  B is called a projection map if P(1)  =  1 and P2  =  P. The theory of such maps is intimately related to the theory of Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators under the Jordan product [formula] for a,b∈Bsa, the self-adjoint operators in B. See [\cite=HS] for the theory of Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators. In fact, if P is faithful, so [formula] for a > 0, then A  =  P(Bsa) is a Jordan subalgebra of Bsa, [\cite=ES]. Furthermore, by [\cite=S2] P is decomposable if and only if A is a reversible Jordan algebra, i.e. A is closed under symmetric products a1a2...an  +  anan - 1...a1, with ai∈A. In the present section we shall sharpen the above result by replacing decomposable by (2,2)-decomposable maps. For simplicity we shall assume the C*  -  algebra B is acting on a finite dimensional Hilbert space H and denote the usual trace on B(H) by Tr.

Let B be a C*  -  algebra acting on a finite dimensional Hilbert space. Let P:B  →  B be a trace preserving unital projection map. Then we have: (i) P is (2,2)-decomposable if and only if P is decomposable. (ii) P is atomic if and only if A = P(Bsa) is a nonreversible Jordanalgebra.

The proof will be divided into some lemmas. We first recall that a spin system in B(H) is a set (si)i∈I of symmetries, i.e. self-adjoint unitaries in B(H), such that [formula] for i  ≠  j. The real linear span of 1 and the si is a Jordan algebra called a spin factor, see [\cite=HS] Chapter 6. If H is finite dimensional there is a canonical positive trace preserving projection map P of B(H) onto A + iA, see [\cite=ES]. For simplicity we often write P:B(H)  →  A.

Let A  ⊂  B(H) be a spin factor. Let e1,...,ek be nonzero minimal projections in the commutant of A with sum 1. Let

[formula]

be the canonical projection map, and let P:B(H)  →  A be the canonical projection map. Let αi:Aei  →  A by α(aei)  =  a. Then αi is an isomorphism, and

[formula]

Hence P is decomposable if and only if each Pi is decomposable.

Proof.  Since A is a simple Jordan algebra αi is an isomorphism. Let (sj) be a spin system generating A. Then (sjei) is a spin system generating Aei. Let ci  =  Tr(ei)- 1. Then ciTr is the tracial state on eiB(H)ei, and the canonical projection Pi being the orthogonal projection of eiB(H)ei with respect to the Hilbert Schmidt structure onto the subspace generated by Aei is given by

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

Let [formula], given by [formula]. Then E is completely positive, and by uniqueness of P as the trace invariant projection of B(H) onto A, P is the restriction

[formula]

Thus, if a∈B(H) then

[formula]

Since E and αi are completely positive, P is decomposable if and only if each Pi is decomposable. The proof is complete.

In the case when A is a spin factor we have reduced the proof of the theorem to the case when A is irreducible, C*(A)  =  B(H), or equivalently the commutant of A is the scalars.

Let R2 denote the real symmetric 2  ×  2 matrices. Let [formula] be a positive map such that if ιR2 denotes the identity map on R2, then ιR2  ≥  μφ for some μ  ≥  0. Then φ  =  λιR2 for some λ  ≥  0.

Proof.  Let e be a 1-dimensional projection in R2. Then e  =  ιR2(e)  ≥  μφ(e)  ≥  0, so φ(e) = αe,α  ≥  0. Similarly φ(1 - e) = β(1 - e), since 1 - e is also 1-dimensional. Thus φ(1) belongs to the maximal abelian subalgebra of R2 generated by e. This holds for all minimal projections e in R2, which is possible only if φ(1) = λ1 for some λ  ≥  0. Since λ1  =  αe  +  β(1 - e),α  =  β  =  λ, i.e. φ(e) = λe for all minimal projections e∈R2, so that φ  =  λιR2. The proof is complete.

Let A  ⊂  B(H) be a spin factor and P the canonical projection of B(H) onto A. Suppose φ:B(H)  →  B(H) is a positive linear map such that φ  ≤  μP for some μ  >  0. Then the restriction φ|A  =  λιA for some λ  ≥  0, where ιA is the identity map on A.

Proof.  Let si and sj,i  ≠  j, belong to the spin system generating A, and let Fij denote the canonical trace preserving conditional expectation of B(H) onto the C*  -  algebra C*(si,sj) generated by si and sj. Since span{1,si,sj}≃R2, by Lemma 3 the restriction [formula] for some λ  ≥  0. Thus we have [formula] and [formula] and similarly for sj. Since this holds for all j  ≠  i, it follows that [formula] and [formula] for all i  ≠  j. Thus φ(1) = λ1  +  aij with aij orthogonal to C*(si,sj) in the Hilbert Schmidt structure. But then aij = akl  =  a for all i,j,k,l, and so a is orthogonal to A2  =  {xy:x,y∈A}. Similarly φ(si) = λsi  +  b with b orthogonal to A2. Scaling φ we may assume

[formula]

Let s = si and [formula] Then e is a projection in A. Since φ  ≤  μP, φ(e)  ≤  μe. Since [formula] is a projection orthogonal to e, we have φ(e)f = 0, and similarly φ(f)e  =  0. Calculating we get, using that s2  =  1

[formula]

[formula]

Adding these two equations we get 0  =  a  -  bs, hence φ(1)  =  1  +  bs, and φ(s) = s  +  b  =  (1  +  bs)s  =  φ(1)s. Thus the product of the two self-adjoint operators φ(1) and s is self-adjoint, hence they commute. Since s  =  si was an arbitrary symmetry in the spin system spanning A,φ(1) belongs to the commutant of A. But A was assumed to be irreducible, so bs  =  0  =  b, so that φ(1) = 1, and φ(si) = si for all i. This completes the proof of the lemma.

Let A be an irreducible spin factor acting on the finite dimensional Hilbert space H. Let φ,ψ:B(H)  →  B(H) be unital maps with φ 2-positive and ψ 2-copositive such that their restrictions to A are the identity map. Let s,t be distinct symmetries in the spin system spanning A. Then

[formula]

Proof.  Let x = s  +  it. Since st  =   - ts we have

[formula]

Hence x*x  +  xx*  =  4  ·  1∈A. Since φ is 2-positive it satisfies the Schwarz inequality [\cite=Cho], Cor. 2.8, hence φ(x*x)  ≥  φ(x)*φ(x)  =  x*x, and φ(xx*)  ≥  φ(x)φ(x)*  =  xx*. Thus

[formula]

Hence φ(x*x)  =  x*x, and φ(xx*)  =  xx*. In particular φ(st)  =  st.

Since ψ is 2-copositive , ψ(x*x)  ≥  ψ(x)ψ(x)*  =  xx*, so by the above argument applied to ψ we get ψ(st)  =  ts, completing the proof.

Let φ,ψ:B(H)  →  B(H) be unital maps with φ 2-positive and ψ 2-copositive. Let a∈B(H). Then we have: (i) If φ(aa*)  =  φ(a)φ(a)*, then [formula] (ii) If ψ(a*a)  =  ψ(a)ψ(a)*, then [formula]

Proof.  Let

[formula]

Then <  ,  >   is an operator valued sesquilinear form such that for all states ω on B(H), < x,y > ω  =  ω( < x,y > ) is a sesquilinear form. Thus by the Cauchy - Schwarz inequality

[formula]

Hence if a is as in the statement of (i), then < a,b > ω  =  0 for all ω, hence < a,b >  = 0, i.e. φ(ab*)  =  φ(a)φ(b*) for all b∈B(H), proving (i).

(ii) In this case we consider the operator valued sesquilinear form

[formula]

and we use the same argumens as in (i). The proof is complete.

Let Vk denote the spin factor generated by a spin system consisting of k symmetries, defined as in [\cite=HS], section 6.2.

Let P be the canonical projection of B(H) onto the spin factor A. Suppose P is (2,2)-decomposable. Then P is decomposable, and A is one of the spin factors V2,V3,V5.

Proof.  By Lemma 2 we may assume the C*  -  algebra generated by A,C*(A) = B(H). Suppose P  =  φ  +  ψ with φ 2-positive and ψ 2-copositive. By Lemma 4 we can replace φ and ψ by maps which are the identity map on A, and asssume P  =  λφ  +  (1  -  λ)ψ,0  ≤  λ  ≤  1. Then by Lemma 5 if sk  ≠  sj are symmetries in the spin system spanning A then φ(sksj) = sksj, and ψ(sksj)  =  sjsk. From the proof of Lemma 5 if x  =  sk  +  isj, then φ(xx*) = xx*, and ψ(xx*) = x*x, so by Lemma 6

[formula]

Now the monomials si1si2...sin span C*(A)  =  B(H) linearly. For such monomials we have, since the above equation holds in particular for sksj,

[formula]

Thus φ is the identity map. Similarly we have

[formula]

so that ψ is an anti-automorphism of order 2, which is the identity on A. In particular φ is completely positive, and ψ is copositive. It follows that P is decomposable. It then follows from [\cite=S2], Corollary 7.3, that A is reversible, hence by [\cite=HS], Theorem 6.2.5, that A is one of the spin factors V2,V3,V5. The proof is complete.

Proof of Theorem 1. Let B be a C*  -  algebra acting on the finite dimensional Hilbert space H, and let P be a unital trace preserving positive projection map of B into itself. Let A = P(Bsa). By [\cite=ES] A is a Jordan subalgebra of Bsa. Composing P with the trace invariant conditional expectation E of B(H) onto B we may assume that P is a projection of B(H) onto A. This does not alter the conclusion of the theorem since E is completely positive, see e.g. [\cite=str],Proposition 9.3. Let Z denote the center of A, see [\cite=HS], 2.5.1, which is the self-adjoint part of an abelian C*  -  algebra. Let p be a minimal projection in Z. Then by [\cite=HS], Proposition 5.2.17, the center of [formula] so pAp is a Jordan factor, also called a JW-factor. It follows that [formula] with pj a minimal central projection in A, and Apj is a Jordan factor.

By [\cite=HS],section 6.3, a Jordan factor C is either a spin factor or is reversible. In the latter case a projection onto C is necessarily decomposable,[\cite=S2], Corollary 7.4, hence it remains to consider the case when Apj is a spin factor. But then Lemma 7 implies that the projection is decomposable if and only if it is (2,2)-decomposable, which proves part (i) of the theorem. Part (ii) is immediate from part (i) by again applying [\cite=S2]. The proof is complete.

A closer look at the proof shows that we have proved a slightly more general result. Instead of assuming the projection map P is the sum of a 2-positive map φ and a 2-copositive map ψ, we could have assumed φ to satisfy the Schwarz inequality φ(x*x)  ≥  φ(x)*φ(x) and ψ the inequality ψ(x*x)  ≥  ψ(x)ψ(x)*.

Theorem 1 has a natural generalization to positive maps.

If B is a finite dimensional C*  -  algebra and φ:B  →  B is a positive unital map, then the fixed point set Bφ  =  {a∈B:φ(a)  =  a} has a natural structure as a Jordan algebra, see [\cite=ES]. Furthermore, if there exists a faithful φ  -  invariant state on B, then there exists a faithful φ  -  invariant positive projection map Pφ:B  →  Bφ making (Bφ)sa a Jordan subalgebra of Bsa. We then have the following extension of Theorem 1.

Let B be C*  -  algebra acting on a finite dimensional Hilbert space. Suppose φ:B  →  B is a trace preserving unital positive map. Let Pφ:B  →  Bφ be the φ  -  invariant positive projection of B onto Bφ. If φ is (2,2)-decomposable then Pφ is decomposable, and (Bφ)sa is a reversible Jordan algebra. In particular if (Bφ)sa is nonreversible, then φ is atomic.

Proof.  The projection map Pφ is a weak limit of averages [formula]. If φ is (2,2)-decomposable, so is φn, say φn  =  αn  +  βn with αn 2-positive, and βn 2-copositive. Now a subnet of (φn) converges weakly to Pφ. If α and β are corresponding weak limit points of αn and βn then α is 2-positive, and β is 2-copositive. Thus Pφ is (2,2)-decomposable, so by Theorem 1 Pφ is decomposable, because φ was assumed to be trace preserving, hence so is Pφ, and therefore Pφ is faithful. By [\cite=S2], Corollary 7.3, (Bφ)sa is reversible. The proof is complete.
