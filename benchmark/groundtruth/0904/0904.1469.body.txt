Presentations of subgroups of the braid group generated by powers of band generators

Introduction

Inspired by the Tits conjecture and its solution by Crisp and Paris, [\cite=cp], we investigate subgroups of the braid groups [formula] generated by powers of the band generators aij. They are the generators in the 'dual' or BKL presentation of [formula]:

[formula]

and can be identified with the following braid diagrams:

=8mm So for a given symmetric matrix M = (mij) of exponents, the Coxeter datum, we define

[formula]

As usual a vanishing exponent mij = 0 yields the identity element, thus EM is in fact generated by the powers of band generators aij with [formula].

In that generality the groups EM were introduced by Kluitmann, cf. [\cite=klui], in conjunction with the more prominent Coxeter and Artin group associated with M:

[formula]

(Note that our entries mij = 0 in the Coxeter datum serve the same purpose as entries mij  =    ∞  , which are more commonly used.)

For M of large type, ie. [formula], Kluitmann proved (and conjectured for non-redundant M, ie. [formula]) that EM is the stabiliser of [formula] for the natural action of [formula] on [formula]. If mij = 1 is not excluded, EM may only be expected to be the stabiliser of [formula] for the action on [formula], cf. [\cite=hurwitz].

For M of ADE-type Dörner [\cite=Doe] proved Kluitmanns conjecture. The stabiliser group and hence EM has been shown by Looijenga, cf [\cite=loo] and others to be the fundamental group of the complement of the bifurcation set in the truncated versal unfolding of the hypersurface singularity of the same type (ADE).

In any case EM as a subgroup of a braid group [formula] acts freely and discontinously on a contractible CW-complex of dimension n - 1, and therefore deserves our special interest.

While we would like to find a presentation of EM in terms of its natural generators in general, we can provide two partial results in this paper.

Our first result is to give the presentation of EM in case of matrices M of large type:

In case of matrices M of large type, ie. mij  ≠  1,2 for all 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n, the elements bij = amijij with mij  ≥  3 generate the subgroup EM with presentation

[formula]

If mij = 0 for all i,j such that [formula] this covers the braid group case of the theorem of Crisp and Paris.

Second we determine a presentation in the cases at the other extreme, when only exponents 1 and 2 are allowed. In this case several distinct matrices may lead to the same subgroup EM. Therefore we include a condition on M which give a distinguished matrix in each case.

Given a symmetric matrix M with entries mij∈{1,2} such that mik is equal 1 if mij and mjk are, a presentation of EM generated by bij = amijij is obtained imposing the following relations:

Such groups EM can be identified with subgroups of [formula] preserving a partition P of {1,...,n} via the natural surjection [formula]. These groups were considered before by Manfredini [\cite=manf] who gave presentations which are more economical in terms of generators than ours. In contrast it is much easier to state and prove the relations of our presentations.

In particular the pure braid group [formula] corresponds to the matrix M with all entries mij = 2. We thus get a presentation of [formula], which differs from the classical presentation of Artin [\cite=ar] but recovers in fact the earlier one by Burau [\cite=bu].

Of the following three sections we devote the first two to the proofs of the two theorems, while in the last sections we want to suggest an approach in the case with M of ADE-type.

The case of matrices of large type

In their approach Crisp and Paris exploit a geometric action of Artin groups on a fundamental groupoid and the solution of the word problem for right-angled Artin groups.

We follow their strategy but in place of their action we pick a natural geometric representation of [formula], the identification with the mapping class group of the punctured disc. Then we get an induced action on the fundamental group of the punctured disc, which we identify with the free group Fn  =  〈t1,...,tn  |    〉. The right Hurwitz actions of [formula] on Fn and the universal Coxeter quotient n  =  〈s1,...,sn  |  s2i = 1  〉 are given by

[formula]

We must now define the terms to describe some decisive features of the action of generators amjk on elements in n, which we represent by words without repetition in the alphabet s1,...,sn. Occasionally a transformation rule will result in more general words, but reduction, the process of removing a pair of adjacent identical letters, will unambiguously stop at the representing word without repetitions.

Definition

A subword w0 of a word w in the alphabet s1,...,sn is called a jk-subword if it consists of letters sj and sk only, it is called long if it contains at least four letters.

Definition

The jk-factorisation of a word w is given by the unique factorisation

[formula]

such that each wν is a jk-subword of w, possibly of length 0, and such that 1  ≤  iν  ≤  n, iν  ≠  j,k for all ν.

Definition

A jk-subword wν is called critical if either of the following condition holds

the length |wν| is odd and wν has two identical adjacent letters, distinct from sj,sk,

the length |wν| is even, possibly 0, and wν has adjacent letters si and sl with il and jk crossing, that is j,k are either in the even or the odd positions for the natural order of the four numbers i,j,k,l.

Note that being critical is not an absolute notion but depends on the 'embedding' as a subword, more precisely on the adjacent letters.

Suppose that a word w has a jk-factorisation [formula] with no jk-subword wν of length 2|m|. Then the jk-factorisation of (w)amjk can be written as

[formula]

where wν' is critical with |wν'| + |wν|  ≥  2|m| if wν is critical.

Proof: From the Hurwitz action we deduce the following action of a band generator and its powers on any letter using the identity (sjsk) = (sksj)- 1:

[formula]

They imply the following transformation of various jk-subwords, [formula]:

[formula]

Hence we obtain the word w' = (w)amjk by first applying these transformation to the factors wν,siν and then removing adjacent pairs of identical letters.

By the first step we get in general a non-reduced word. Its jk-factorisation has the same number of terms as that of w, since the number of letters distinct from sj,sk is preserved.

In the next step we want to remove all repetitious pairs in the jk-subwords. Each jk-subword between siν and siν + 1 consist of contributions from three sources:

the first from siν: (sjsk)- m if j < iν < k, nothing otherwise.

the second from wν: wν if |wν| is even, (sjsk)mwν if |wν| is odd.

the third from siν + 1: (sjsk)m if j < iν + 1 < k, nothing otherwise.

So the jk-subwords wν' may be written as either (sjsk)mwν, (sjsk)- mwν or wν. Reducing further we get eventually the jk-word wν', which may be empty only if wν is since |wν|  ≠  2|m| is assumed.

But then also the word [formula] has no repetitions, thus our claim on the jk-factorisation of w' is proved.

We are left to consider the two particular cases when wν is critical. If iν = iν + 1 and |wν| is odd, then wν' = (sjsk)±  mwν, hence wν' is critical and |wν|  +  |wν'|  ≥  2|m|. The same conclusion holds if iνiν + 1 and jk are crossing and |wν| is even. [formula]

Suppose that w is without long il-subword while (w)amil, with |m|  ≥  3 has a long jk-subword. Then one of the following two conditions holds:

il and jk are identical,

il and jk are non-crossing and w has a long jk-subword.

Proof: By the previous proposition we may write the il-factorisations of w and its image w' = (w)amil as

[formula]

Any long jk-subword in w' is either

a long il-word, if il and jk are identical,

an alternating sequence of at least two il-words of length 1 and two copies of a letter not in {si,sl}, if il and jk are neither identical nor disjoint,

an alternating sequence of letters sj,sk interspersed by il-subwords of length 0, if il and jk are disjoint.

The first case is accounted for by the claim.

In the second case w' contains a maximal il-subword wν' of length 1 with identical adjacent letters. Hence wν' is critical. But then by prop. [\ref=trans] also wν must be critical and of length [formula] in violation of our assumptions.

In the last case each interspersed il-subword wν' may not be critical, otherwise it would originate in a critical il-subword wν of length [formula] which again is excluded by our assumption. Since the adjacent letters are sj and sk, we conclude that il and jk are non-crossing, as claimed. [formula]

For the ensuing argument we introduce some notation to handle elements of the right-angled Artin groups GM defined on generators in bijection to elements of TM:

[formula]

An expression in the letters bσ is a sequence with non-vanishing exponents pi

[formula]

The index [formula] is called the length of the expression W. Given β in EM we call W an expression for β if

[formula]

As in [\cite=cp] the following terminology is based on Brown. Consider an expression W as above. Suppose that there exists [formula] such that bσi = bσi + 1, put

[formula]

We say that W' is obtained from W via an elementary operation of type I. This operation shortens the length of an expression by 1 or 2.

Suppose that there exists [formula] such that σi,σi + 1 are non-crossing. Put

[formula]

We say that W'' is obtained from W by an elementary operation of type II. This operation leaves the length of an expression unchanged.

We shall say that W is M-reduced if the length of W can not be reduced by applying a sequence of elementary operations. Clearly every element of the right-angled presented group has a reduced expression.

A reduced expression W is said to end in τ∈TM if it is related by a sequence of operations of type II to an expression [formula] in which [formula].

Suppose [formula] is a M-reduced expression for [formula]. If (si)β contains a long jk-subword, then X ends in τ = jk.

Proof: We argue by induction on the length [formula] of X; obviously for trivial X there is nothing to be proved.

Hence given an expression X of length [formula] we may assume that the claim holds for [formula], which is a M-reduced expression for β', where [formula].

Note that (si)β' has no long [formula]-subword, for otherwise X' ends with [formula] by induction, contrary to our assumption that X is M-reduced.

Since [formula] contains a long τ-subword, we conclude with prop. [\ref=7] that either [formula] or [formula] are non-crossing and (si)β' contains a long τ-subword.

In the first case the claim is obviously true. In the second case, by induction, X' ends in τ, hence there is an expression [formula] of β' with [formula], which is obtained by operations of type II from X'. Hence X transforms into [formula].

Since [formula] are non-crossing a further operation of type II yields

[formula]

which shows that X ends in τ as claimed. [formula]

Suppose [formula] is a non-trivial M-reduced expression for β with [formula], [formula]. Then (sj)β  ≠  sj, in particular GM injects into [formula].

Proof: Again [formula] is an expression for [formula]. Suppose contrary to our claim that (sj)β = sj, so

[formula]

By the transformation rules in proposition [\ref=trans] the word on the right contains a long jk-subword, hence the same is true on the left hand side. With proposition [\ref=9] we conclude that X' ends in [formula]. Now we have reached a contradiction to the hypothesis that X is M-reduced, thus our claim holds true. [formula]

The observation of the proposition concludes the proof of theorem [\ref=large] since GM now maps isomorphically onto EM identifying the respective sets of generators.

Our argument give also a new prove of the Tits conjecture in case of the braid group and large exponents, ie. at least 3.

partition preserving braid subgroups

We want to study the groups EM of theorem [\ref=manf] in terms of corresponding partitions P of the set {1,...,n}. Given such a partition we define its stabiliser in the symmetric group Sn to be

[formula]

where ~  P is the unique equivalence relation with set of equivalence classes equal to P.

The significance of these notions for our problem lies in the following correspondence:

There is a natural bijection between matrices M as in theorem [\ref=manf] and the partitions P of {1,...,n} such that there is a natural diagram with exact rows:

[formula]

Proof: To a partition P we associate the unique matrix M with mij = 1  ⇔  i  ~  Pj and mij = 2 otherwise. The additional condition, mij = mjk = 1  ⇒  mik = 1, holds for M since ~  P is transitive. Reversely with M we may define the relation [formula], which obviously is reflexive and symmetric, but also transitive due to the additional condition on M. The set of equivalence classes yields the partition P associated with M.

For the second claim we first convince ourselves that Sn,P is generated by all transpositions (ij) with i  ~  Pj. For the associated M obviously EM contains [formula]. Moreover (ij) has a preimage bij in EM if and only if mij = 1, hence EM surjects onto Sn,P. [formula]

In order to prove theorem [\ref=manf] we want to set up an induction over n which is well-based, since the cases n = 1,n = 2 are obviously true. Given a partition P of {1,...,n} we define the induced partition P' of {1,...,n - 1} and we denote by P'n the partition of {1,...,n} for which {n} is a part on its own and all other part are those of P'.

Moreover we use ai as a shorthand for ai  n

Suppose EP' is presented as 〈bjk,1  ≤  j < k < n  |  R'〉, then EP'n has a presentation by generating elements a2i,bjk subject to relations in R' and

In particular the theorem [\ref=manf] holds true for EP'n, if it holds true for EP'.

Proof: All given relations are shown to hold by a straightforward calculation. On the other hand we can argue with the following natural diagram of split exact rows:

[formula]

Hence it suffices to show that all relations obtained from the action of the extension can be deduced from those given in the claim. These relations are easily obtained by 'combing' the braid obtained by conjugation. The following list - with i < j < k < n and mij = 1 in case 3,4, resp. mij = 2 in case 5,6, mik = 1 in case 7 and mik = 2 in case 8 - is exhaustive.

[formula]

We may now apply the claim of the main part of the lemma to the particular case in which R' is the set of relations associated to EP' and the generators bjk,1  ≤  j  <  k < n in the claim of the theorem and 〈bjk,j,k < n|R'〉 is a presentation of EP'.

Then of course EP'n is presented by generators bij,i,j < n and bi  n = a2i  n subject to the relations R' and those of the list, we just derived. Since they correspond bijectively to relations of the theorem [\ref=manf] in case P = P'n we have concluded our proof. [formula]

Now given a general P we consider the group GM given by the presentation of theorem [\ref=manf] in terms of the matrix M associated to P by [\ref=partit], but with elements ij to mark the distinction with the subgroups of [formula]. Let I  ⊂  {1,...,n} be the equivalence class of n under ~  P. Then we denote by HM the subgroup of GM generated by elements {ij,i < j < n}, [formula] and {2i: = 2in,i∈I}, where we take n = 1.

GM can be given as a finite union of right cosets of HM (with n = 1):

[formula]

Proof: Since each generator is either in HM or in {t|t∈I}, all generators of GM belong to this union of cosets and multiplication by any generator on the left maps HM to one of the given cosets. Hence it remains to prove that multiplication on the left by any generator [formula] of GM maps an element of any of the non-trivial given cosets of HM into one of the given cosets. We refer by roman numbers to the relations of the theorem which are used and freely move factors from and into HM:

[formula]

t  i,k∈I, i.e. mik = 1, then with * ): cases (a) and (c) of i) above

[formula]

[formula]

We are now ready to give the proof of our second theorem.

Proof: The case n = 1 is void and the case n = 2 consists of two subcases with group E freely generated by σ1 resp. σ21 in accordance with the claim. Hence it suffices to prove the claim for matrices M of size n relying on the induction hypothesis. In fact we will show that there is an isomorphism GM  →  EM induced by the natural bijection ij  →  bij on generators.

First we observe that we get in fact a surjection, since the relations in GM map to relations in [formula], which can be checked by straightforward calculations. Moreover we note that the subgroup HM maps onto EP'n where P'n is obtained as before from the partition P associated to M.

We will now exploit the induction hypothesis and lemma [\ref=combing], which provide a presentation of EP'n, to get at least a partial inverse EP'n  →  HM. Since the relations in R' pose no problems we restrict to enumerate the relations in GM from which the relations of EP'n in the corresponding enumeration of lemma [\ref=combing] follow.

ijk  =  jki

according to mkn = 2 or 1 either a2k  ↦  k (a), or a2k  ↦  2k (b).

jkik- 1k  =  kik- 1kj

j2kik- 2k  =  2kik- 2kj

since mij = 1 either [formula] and a2i  ↦  i,  a2j  ↦  j (a), or ai,aj∈EM and a2i  ↦  2i, a2j  ↦  2j (b).

ijj  =  jij,  ijij  =  ijij

iji  =  ij  =  jij implies ij2i  =  2jij and ij2i2j  =    j  =  i    =  iijjij  =  2i2jij

since mij = 2 either [formula] and a2i  ↦  i,  a2j  ↦  j (a), or [formula] and a2i  ↦  2i, a2j  ↦  2j (b), or [formula] and a2i  ↦  2i, a2j  ↦  2j (c).

ijij  =  jiji,  ijij  =  ijij

ijij  =  jiji and ij  =  iji imply 2ijij  =  jij2i and 2ijij  =      =  ijiij  =  ij2ij

jiji  =  ijij and jij  =  ij imply 2jiji  =  iji2j and 2jiji  =      =  ijjij  =  i2jij

Next we consider the following diagram with exact rows:

[formula]

Hence EP'n is of finite index |I| =   #  {i  ≤  n  |  i  ~  Pn} in EP. This injection factors as [formula]. Since by lemma [\ref=cosets] the index of HM in GM is at most |I|, we can conclude that EP is isomorphic to GM. [formula]

further prospects

In this last section we want to address two directions of further studies. First we would like to mention the simplest instance of a structural result describing groups associated to a matrix M composed of several submatrices in terms of the groups associated to these submatrices.

Suppose M is a block matrix with diagonal blocks M1,M2 and zero off-diagonal blocks. Then the groups associated to M1,M2 are free or direct factors:

[formula]

It should also be worthwhile to understand how the group EM changes under the action of a permutation matrix on M.

More emphasis we would like to put on the problem to find presentations for matrices with entries mij  ≥  2, in particular with matrices of finite irreducible Coxeter groups.

The following result on relation between the generators of such groups EM is obtained by straightforward calculations.

In case of matrices M with entries [formula], the group EM generated by bij = amijij has relations

for i < j < k < l

[formula]

for i < j < k < l and mjk = 2

[formula]

for i < j < k, j < k < i or k < i < j with

mij = mik = 2, mjk = 2ν

[formula]

mij = mik = 2, mjk = 2ν + 1

[formula]

mij = 2,mik = mjk = 3

[formula]

mij = 2,mik = 3,mjk = 4

[formula]

mij = 2,mik = 3,mjk = 5

[formula]

In fact we will prove that the given relations are sufficient to present the group EM in case M is a Coxeter matrix for a Coxeter group of type A, D or E in a forthcoming paper. The methods employed will be totally different, since we will actually exploit braid monodromy techniques, cf. [\cite=habil], to plane curve complements, which can be shown to have complements with fundamental group isomorphic to EM.
