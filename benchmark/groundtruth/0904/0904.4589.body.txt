Wigner's Theorem and geometry of extreme positive maps

Introduction

Symmetries play a very important role in physics, as it has been stressed by Wigner on several occasions [\cite=wigner49] [\cite=wigner64] [\cite=houtappel65]. The way symmetries are realized depends on the theory under consideration and more specifically, according to Felix Klein, on the corresponding geometric structure of the carrier space, these are 'kinematical' rather than 'dynamical' symmetries. It is well known that any description of physical systems requires the consideration of states and observables along with a pairing among them providing a real number with a computable probability [\cite=mackey63]. In the Schrödinger-Dirac description of Quantum Mechanics one associates a Hilbert space with a quantum system, states are identified with rays of this space and observables are a derived concept - they are identified with self-adjoint operators, while symmetries are defined to be bijections among rays which preserve probability transitions.

In the C*-algebraic approach to Quantum Mechanics, originated from the Heisenberg picture, observables are identified with real elements of this C*-algebra, while states are a derived concept - they are identified with positive normalized functionals on the space of observables. The space of observables carries the structure of a Jordan algebra and this was the point of view of Kadison to define symmetries as Jordan-algebra isomorphisms [\cite=kadison51] [\cite=kadison65]. C*-algebras are quite convenient to deal with the description of composite systems, the dual space of states turns out to have a rather involved geometrical structure. In particular, to take into account the distinction between separable and entangled states on the space of states, one is obliged to give up linear superposition in favor of convex combinations. This change of perspective introduces highly nontrivial problems, specific to the 'convex setting'. As shown elsewhere [\cite=gkm05], in finite dimensions the space of states turns out to be a stratified manifold with faces of various dimensions.

The aim of this paper is to deal with symmetries as those transformations on the space of states which are appropriate for its geometrical structure. In doing this we end up with yet another variant of the celebrated Wigner's theorem on the realization of symmetries as unitary or antiunitary transformations on the Hilbert space. The literature on this theorem, which is also available on text books [\cite=gottfried04] [\cite=esposito04] in addition to the famous book by Wigner [\cite=wigner59], is huge. We limit ourselves to a partial list trying to give a sampling of the various approaches which have been taken in the years [\cite=hagedorn59] [\cite=lomont63] [\cite=oraifeartaigh63] [\cite=bargmann64] [\cite=roberts69] [\cite=hunziker72] [\cite=bracci75] [\cite=samuel97] [\cite=cassinelli97].

The paper is organized in the following way: in Section [\ref=sec:denstates] we give a short geometrical description of the set of density states in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Density states form a convex body in the space of Hermitian operators. The set of affine maps which map a convex set K into itself, called simply positive maps, is also a convex set in the space of affine maps. Characterization of positive maps, e.g. by identifying the extremal ones, i.e. maps which can not be decomposed into a nontrivial convex combination of other positive maps, can lead to a useful description of the underlying set K. Finding extreme points of such maps is, however, a difficult task, even if we know explicitly the extreme points of K. In Section [\ref=sec:positivemaps] we discuss and give examples of positive maps for which their extremality can be established upon analyzing the number of extreme points in the image. In Section [\ref=sec:wigner] we connect the obtained results to the Wigner's theorem expressed in terms of positive maps which are bijective on pure states. Sections [\ref=sec:CP] and [\ref=sec:extremeCP] are devoted to completely positive maps. In particular, we show again how the number of extreme points in their image establishes their form and extremality. We conclude with Section [\ref=sec:examples] containing illustrative examples of extreme positive and completely positive maps in low dimensions.

Density states

Let H be a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, [formula], and let gl(H) be the space of complex linear operators on H. The space gl(H) is canonically a Hilbert space itself with the Hermitian product [formula]. As in [\cite=gkm05], we shall treat the real linear space of Hermitian operators on H as the dual space, [formula], of the Lie algebra (of antihermitian operators), [formula], of the unitary group U(H). We have the obvious decomposition [formula] into real subspaces with a natural pairing between [formula] and [formula] given by

[formula]

and a scalar product induced on [formula] by the Hermitian product and given by

[formula]

We denote with ||  ·  ||* the corresponding norm.

The coadjoint action of U(H) on [formula] reads

[formula]

We denote by P(H) the space of positive semi-definite operators from gl(H), i.e. of those ρ∈gl(H) which can be written in the form ρ = T†T for a certain T∈gl(H). It is a cone, since it is invariant with respect to the homotheties by λ with λ  ≥  0. The set of density states D(H) is distinguished in the cone P(H) by the equation [formula], so we will regard P(H) and D(H) as embedded in u*(H).

The space D(H) is a convex set in the affine hyperplane u*1(H) in u*(H), determined by the equation [formula]. The model vector space for u*1(H) is therefore canonically identified with the space of Hermitian operators with trace 0. The space [formula] of affine maps of u*1(H) can be canonically identified with the space of these linear maps Φ∈L(u*(H)) which preserve the trace.

It is known that the set of extreme points of D(H) coincides with the set D1(H) of pure states, i.e. the set of one-dimensional orthogonal projectors [formula], and that every element of D(H) is a convex combination of points from D1(H). The space D1(H) of pure states can be identified with the complex projective space [formula] via the projection

[formula]

which identifies the points of the orbits of the [formula]-group action by complex homotheties.

If we choose an orthonormal basis [formula] in H, we can identify u*(H) with the real vector space u*(n) of Hermitian n  ×  n matrices, u*1(H) with the affine space of Hermitian n  ×  n matrices with trace 1, U(H) with the group U(n) of unitary matrices, D(H) with D(n) - the convex body of density n  ×  n matrices, etc. Recall that the dimension of u*1(n) is n2 - 1 and the dimension of u*(n) is n2.

Almost all above can be repeated in the case when H is infinite-dimensional if we assume that all the operators in question, i.e. operators from gl(H) and u*(H) are Hilbert-Schmidt operators (see [\cite=gkm07]). The positive semi-definite operators then, being of the form AA†, are trace-class (nuclear) operators, so density states are trace-class operators with trace 1. There are some obvious minor differences with respect to finite dimensions: for instance, the convex set D(H) of density states is the closed convex hull of the set D1(H) of pure states, rather than just the convex hull, etc.

Positive maps of convex sets

If K is a convex set in a locally convex topological vector space E, then the set [formula] of those continuous linear maps Φ:E  →  E which map K into K is a convex set in the (real) vector space L(E) of all continuous linear maps from E into E. We will refer to elements of [formula] as to linear K-positive maps, or simply to linear positive maps, if K is determined.

If K is compact, then, due to the Krein-Milman Theorem, it is the closed convex hull of the set K0 of its extreme points (points which are not interior points of intervals included in K), [formula]. In this sense, compact convex sets K are completely determined by their extreme points.

However, it should be made clear from the beginning that the concepts of convex set, positive map, etc., are taken from the affine rather than linear algebra and geometry. In an affine space [formula], one can subtract points, x = p - p', to get vectors of the model vector space [formula], or add a vector to a point, p = p' + x, to get another point, but there is no distinguished point that serves as the origin. More generally, in affine spaces we can take affine combinations of points, i.e. combinations [formula] such that [formula]. If all [formula] are non-negative the corresponding affine combination is just a convex combination. We say that points [formula] are affinely independent if none is an affine combination of the others. This is the same as to say that [formula] are linearly independent vectors.

Convex sets in our approach will live in affine spaces. In this sense the Krein-Milman Theorem tells us something about compact convex sets in affine spaces modeled on locally convex linear spaces.

One can think that the problem is artificial, since by choosing a point in an affine space as the origin we end up in the model vector space. However, choosing a point is an additional information put into the scheme which changes our setting. The situation is like in a gauge theory, where we can fix a gauge. But a fixed gauge has, in general, no physical interpretation, so we rather try to use gauge-invariant objects.

The second instance of affine space presence is the fact that in many situations, even when we work in a true linear space, it makes much more sense to admit that positive maps are affine. Note that affine maps on an affine hyperspace [formula] of a linear space [formula] come exactly from linear maps in [formula] which preserve [formula]. On the other hand, every affine space (or even affine bundle) [formula] can be canonically embedded in a linear space (vector bundle) [formula] as an affine hyperspace (affine hyperbundle). We refer to [\cite=GGU2004] [\cite=GGU2007] for the corresponding theory with interesting applications to frame-independent formulations of some problems in Analytical Mechanics.

Note that the set D(H) of density states for quantum systems with a finite number of levels is an example of a convex body, as it is canonically embedded in the Euclidean affine space u*1(H) of Hermitian operators with trace 1 - an affine hyperspace of u*(H).

It is easy to see that for a compact convex set K in a finite-dimensional affine space [formula] the closed convex hull [formula] is just the convex hull con(K0) if only K0  ⊂  K is closed, and that the convex set of positive maps [formula] is again a compact convex set, this time in [formula]. Note that [formula] is canonically an affine space modeled on the vector space [formula] of affine maps from [formula] into E. Moreover, if [formula] is just a vector space, [formula], the space [formula] is a vector space with a canonical decomposition [formula], due to the fact that we can write any affine map Φ:E  →  E uniquely in the form Φ(x) = v(Φ)(x) + x0 for some v(Φ)∈L(E) and x0∈E.

Fix-extreme positive maps

In general it is not easy to find extreme points [formula] of the convex set of positive maps [formula], even if extreme points of the convex body K are explicitly known. This is exactly the case of the convex bodies [formula] of positive maps in Quantum Mechanics.

On the other hand, extremality of some positive maps can be established relatively easy in the case of maps with many extreme points in the image, as each extreme point in the image fixes partially the map. This is based on the observation that, for [formula], if p0∈K0 is the image p0  =  Φ(p) for some p∈K, then Φi(p) = p0 for any Φi of a decomposition [formula] into a convex combination of [formula]. Indeed, as [formula] is a decomposition of the extreme point p0 into a convex combination of points Φi(p)∈K, then Φi(p) = p0. This immediately implies the following.

Let qi∈K, [formula], be such that pi  =  Φ(qi) are extreme and affinely independent and assume that we have a decomposition Φ = tΦ0 + (1 - t)Φ1 for certain [formula] and 0 < t < 1. According to the observation preceding the above theorem, Φ0(qi) = Φ1(qi) = Φ(qi) = pi for all [formula]. But an affine map from a n-dimensional affine space is completely determined by its values on n + 1 affinely independent points, so Φ0  =  Φ1  =  Φ.

The extreme positive maps Φ described in the above theorem (with n + 1 affinely independent extreme points in the image Φ(K)) will be called fix-extreme positive maps.

For any convex body K a positive map Ψ which has all extreme points in Ψ(K) is extreme positive. In particular, the identity map is always an extreme positive map.

Example: the closed unit ball in [formula]

The proof of the above theorem will be based on the following lemma.

If the function [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], [formula], has on the unit sphere [formula] local maxima at some n + 1 affinely independent points [formula], then F is constant on Sn - 1. In particular, [formula] and [formula].

We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers and consider the function

[formula]

Since qj, [formula], are critical points of F, when restricted to the sphere, the coordinates [formula] of each qj solve the system of equations

[formula]

Moreover, as at qj we have local maxima, the second derivative of [formula] must be non-positive definite that yields [formula] for all i. We can assume that [formula], so [formula].

Assume first that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

and

[formula]

should be equal to 1. But the function [formula] is monotone with respect to [formula], so there is at most one solution [formula] of ([\ref=e1]) with [formula]. It must be therefore at least n additional solutions with [formula]. Let k be the number of the biggest [formula], i.e. [formula]. We get easily from ([\ref=e1]) that

[formula]

Hence if k = n then F is constantly [formula] on the sphere. It suffices to show now that k < n is not possible. Indeed, if x is a solution of ([\ref=e1]) with [formula], we get

[formula]

so we can have, together with the solution ([\ref=s]) corresponding to [formula], an affinely independent set of n + 1 solutions only if k = n - 1. But then, due to ([\ref=b]), the solution ([\ref=s]) must be

[formula]

so pn  ≠  0 and [formula] reduces to

[formula]

and

[formula]

On the other hand, the solutions corresponding to [formula] must be of the form

[formula]

so that we have solutions additional to ([\ref=s0]) only if

[formula]

But, as [formula], the latter contradicts ([\ref=G]):

[formula]

Now we can prove Theorem [\ref=t1].

Let [formula] be the unit ball in an n-dimensional Euclidean vector space E. Let us make an identification of E with [formula] with the standard Euclidean norm

[formula]

Let Φ be a fix-extreme positive map of [formula], i.e. [formula] is an affine map, Φ(x) = A(x) + p', where [formula] is a linear map of [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] has n + 1 affinely independent points [formula] in the unit sphere Sn - 1. Of course, we can assume that [formula] are extreme points of [formula], so they lie on the sphere as well. In particular the map (matrix) A is invertible.

Now we can apply the singular value decomposition to the matrix A in order to write it in the form [formula], where O1,O2 are orthogonal matrices and T is a diagonal matrix with positive entries [formula] on the diagonal. Since we can write

[formula]

where O1(b) = b', and since the orthogonal maps preserve [formula] and Sn - 1, the map Φ0(x) = T(x) + b has the same properties as Φ: it is a positive map of [formula], [formula] and [formula] has n + 1 affinely independent points [formula] on the unit sphere Sn - 1, where qj = O- 12(q'j) are points of the sphere, [formula]. This means that the function

[formula]

reduced to the unit sphere takes at [formula] local maxima. Applying the above lemma we conclude that b = 0 and F is constant on the sphere, so that Φ0 = T maps the unit sphere into the unit sphere. Hence, T = I and [formula] is orthogonal.

Example: an extreme map on the plane fixing two extreme points

In the present section we want to present a simple example of an extreme map in two dimensions which is a bijection on its two extreme points. To this end let us consider the function on the interval

[formula]

is convex. Let us perform a linear transformation of the (x,y) plane,

[formula]

Under this transformation S is transformed into the set bounded by

[formula]

Positive maps bijective on pure states - a version of Wigner's Theorem

Before we formulate a version of the Wigner's Theorem [\cite=bargmann64] let us comment on complex antilinear and antiunitary maps in a Hilbert space. A map A:H  →  H we call antilinear if [formula], where [formula] denotes the complex conjugation of [formula]. An antilinear map U:H  →  H we call antiunitary if [formula] for all x,y∈H. The adjoint A† of an antilinear map is an antilinear map defined via the identity

[formula]

Any linear (antilinear) map A:H  →  H induces a linear (resp., antilinear) map MA:gl(H)  →  gl(H) which on one-dimensional maps [formula] takes the form [formula]. For linear A we can easily represent the map MA as [formula], while with antilinear maps the situation is a little bit more complicated.

If an orthonormal basis is chosen then in the Hilbert space H we can define a complex conjugation

[formula]

Instead of Cx we will write simply x̄. It is clear that [formula]. If A is a complex linear map then [formula] is antilinear and vice versa. Since any continuous complex linear (antilinear) map A:H  →  H is represented by a (possibly infinite) matrix (aij), where [formula], also the transposition A  ↦  AT is well defined:

[formula]

and we extend it to the whole H by complex linearity (antilinearity). For linear A the adjoint map A† can be then written as

[formula]

so that [formula] for linear Hermitian A = A†. If A is antilinear then [formula] is linear, so

[formula]

But, as easily seen,

[formula]

so that, for Hermitian [formula],

[formula]

The Wigner's Theorem (compare with [\cite=bargmann64]) can be now formulated as follows. The standard versions of Wigner's Theorem usually consider (unit) vectors of the Hilbert space rather than pure states. But if x,y are unit vectors representing pure states [formula] and [formula], respectively, then

[formula]

so that preserving |〈x,y〉| is the same as preserving [formula]. Moreover, any unitary (or antiunitary) action in the Hilbert space, x  ↦  Ux, induces on pure states [formula] the action ([\ref=wt]) or ([\ref=wt1]). We will call the maps ([\ref=wt]) and ([\ref=wt1]) defined on pure states or on u*(H) Wigner maps. The Wigner maps on u*(H) can be abstractly characterized as follows.

The Wigner maps are clearly positive and orthogonal, so let us assume that ψ has these properties. For all Hermitian [formula] we have therefore ([\ref=tp]) and we know that [formula] is positive semi-definite if [formula] is. The map ψ is orthogonal, therefore invertible, and its inverse ψ- 1 is orthogonal as well. Let us observe that ψ- 1 is also a positive map. Take a pure state [formula] and suppose that [formula] has the spectral decomposition [formula] into a difference of positive semi-definite operators [formula] which are orthogonal, [formula]. Then [formula] is a difference of orthogonal positive semi-definite operators [formula] and, as [formula] is a pure state, [formula] (thus [formula]) must be 0. A similar argument shows that the image [formula] of any pure state [formula] is a positive semi-definite operator which is not decomposable into a sum of orthogonal positive semi-definite operators, so [formula] is a pure state up to a constant factor. Since

[formula]

this factor equals 1 and we conclude that ψ induces a bijection on pure states.

We will now prove a theorem which extends Wigner's Theorem and which relates it to the problem of extreme positive maps.

Let u*f(H) be the linear subspace of u*(H) consisting of Hermitian finite-rank operators. For K1,K2  ⊂  u*1(H) we say that a map ψ:K1  →  K2 is affine if ψ is the restriction to K1 of a trace-preserving linear map Φ: < K1  >    →   < K2  >   from the linear span < K1  >   of K1 in u*(H) into the linear span < K2  >   of K2 in u*(H), Φ(K1)  ⊂  K2.

(a)  ⇒  (b). Since u*f(H) is spanned by the set D1(H) of pure states, let Φ:u*f(H)  →  u*f(H) be the (unique) linear trace-preserving map on the space u*f(H) of finite-rank Hermitian operators inducing ψ on D1(H). Since Φ maps convex combinations into convex combinations, Φ maps finite-rank density states into finite-rank density states, so Φ is a positive map. We will prove that Φ is a linear isomorphism on u*f(H). This follows from the fact that Φ preserves the rank, i.e. induces a bijection on Dk(H) for each [formula].

To see the latter let us remark that the rank, [formula], of [formula] is defined as a minimal number of pure states whose linear combination is [formula], so that, as Φ is linear and is a bijection on pure states, [formula]. Conversely, if [formula] is of rank k, then it is a convex combination of some pure states [formula], thus the image by Φ of a convex combination of pure states [formula]. This shows that Dk(H)  ⊂  Φ(Dk(H)). The linear map Φ induces a bijection on D1(H), so assume inductively that it induces a bijection on Dl(H) for l  ≤  k. Let now [formula] be of rank k + 1, [formula], with the spectral decomposition [formula], with [formula], [formula], and [formula] being pairwise orthogonal pure states, [formula], i  ≠  j. We must show that the rank of [formula] is k + 1.

Suppose the contrary. Hence, according to the inductive assumption, [formula] is of rank k. As [formula], where [formula], thus [formula] is of rank k, the image of [formula], thus x'0 belongs to the image of [formula]. Consider the spectral decomposition [formula], with [formula], [formula], and [formula] being pairwise orthogonal pure states, [formula], i  ≠  j. Let H0 (resp., H'0) be the subspace in H spanned by the vectors [formula] (resp., [formula]) and let D1(H0) (resp., D1(H'0)) be the set of all pure states of H0 (resp., H'0), i.e. these pure states from D1(H) which are represented by unit vectors from H0 (resp., H'0). It is now clear that [formula]. Note that pure states [formula] from D1(H'0) can be characterized as such pure states which added to [formula] do not change the rank, [formula]. According to the inductive assumption this implies that [formula] as well, but

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Since we know now that Φ induces bijections on each Dk(H), [formula], it is easy to conclude that it is a rank-preserving isomorphism, so that Φ- 1 is also a positive map. Indeed, as D1(H) spans u*f(H), it is clearly "onto". It is also injective, since [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are density states of finite ranks, implies (Φ is positive) that [formula], thus [formula], as Φ preserves the rank of density states.

To finish the proof, we will need the following lemma.

Let [formula] be a density state of a finite rank k. Then the square of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm [formula] can be characterized as the maximum of the expressions [formula] over all decompositions [formula] of [formula] as a convex combination of k pure states [formula]. This maximum is associated with the spectral decomposition.

As

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Moreover, we have equality in ([\ref=hs]) if and only if we have equality in ([\ref=hs0]), so as all [formula], if and only if [formula] for all i  ≠  j. This corresponds to the spectral decomposition.

The above lemma implies that the map Φ preserves the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of density states. Indeed, if we use the spectral decomposition to write [formula] as a convex combination [formula] of pure states, then [formula] can be expressed as a convex combination of pure states [formula] with the same coefficients, so that [formula]. But we can apply the above consideration to Φ- 1 instead of Φ and get [formula] for any density state of rank k, in particular for [formula]. We get therefore [formula].

Let us now take two pure states [formula] and consider [formula]. Since, according to ([\ref=hs1]),

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

thus

[formula]

so ψ preserves transition probabilities between pure states.

(b)  ⇒  (c) is the Wigner's Theorem.

(c)  ⇒  (a) is obvious.

Moreover, ψ has an obvious unique continuous extension Ψ:u*1(H)  →  u*1(H), [formula] or [formula]. Since Ψ is positive and has all extreme points in its image, it is extreme positive according to the obvious infinite-dimensional version of Corollary [\ref=c1].

If the dimension of the Hilbert space H is n, then the dimension of the affine space u*1(H) of Hermitian operators with trace 1 equals n2 - 1 and we know from the general theory (Theorem [\ref=t0]) that a positive map [formula] possessing n2 pure states in the image Φ(D(H)) of D(H) is extreme positive (we called such positive maps fix-extreme). We finish this section with the following conjecture motivated by Theorem [\ref=t1].

Any fix-extreme positive map [formula] is a Wigner map.

Completely positive maps acting on pure states

A linear map [formula] is called completely positive (CP) if [formula], where MN is the algebra of complex N  ×  N matrices, is positivity-preserving for all N. It was shown by Choi [\cite=choi75] and Kraus [\cite=kraus83] that each CP map admits a representation in the so called Kraus form

[formula]

where Vk are operators acting on H.

Not to deal with the cone of CP operators but rather with a compact convex set (if the dimension of H is finite), one has to put certain normalization condition. We can try to use, for instance, the trace [formula] of a CP operator ([\ref=cp]) as a linear operator on the complex vector space gl(H) which is the same as the trace of ([\ref=cp]) as an operator on the real vector space u*(H) of Hermitian operators.

It suffices to prove ([\ref=tr]) for a single Kraus map A = MV. Choose an orthonormal basis {ei} in H and write V in this basis as a complex matrix V = (vij). As an orthonormal basis in gl(H) we can take [formula]. We have

[formula]

As we can see, the trace can vanish for non-zero CP operators which makes the normalization by trace impossible. There is, however, another possibility of normalizing CP operators provided by the Jamiołkowski isomorphism [\cite=jamiolkowski72]

[formula]

The Jamioł kowski isomorphism maps the operator [formula] into the rank-one operator [formula]. In particular, CP operators correspond, via the Jamioł kowski isomorphism J, to positive semi-definite operators on gl(H) (see, for instance, [\cite=gkm07]). Any Kraus operator MV(ρ) = VρV† corresponds to the one dimensional Hermitian operator [formula]. The spectral decomposition of J(A) results in the decomposition ([\ref=cp]) with Vi being mutually orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt product [formula] in gl(H). Such a decomposition of a CP operator we will call a spectral decomposition. We will call a CP operator normalized if it corresponds, via the Jamioł kowski isomorphism, to a trace-one operator. If ([\ref=cp]) is a spectral decomposition of a CP operator, then it is normalized if

[formula]

We will call [formula] the spectral trace of a CP operator A. The spectral trace is greater or equal to 0 and equals 0 only if A = 0. The convex set of normalized CP operators on gl(H) we will denote by NCP(H). It is clear that extreme points in NCP(H) are exactly single normalized Kraus maps.

From now on we assume the Hilbert space H to be of a finite dimension n.

Recall that on the space of Hermitian operators on H we have a canonical scalar product [formula] and that P(H) denotes the cone of positive semi-definite operators. We will call elements [formula], k  ≥  n, of P(H) to be in general position if for any non-zero ρ∈P(H) we cannot find n of them which are orthogonal to ρ. If ρi are of rank-one, [formula], where [formula], this simply means that any n vectors of [formula] form a linear basis in H.

(a)⇒  (b). It was proven in [\cite=grabowski06] (Theorem 7).

(b)⇒  (c). If [formula] then [formula], hence A maps pure states into rank-one operators, and V, being invertible, preserves all linear independencies.

(c)⇒  (d) - trivial.

(d)⇒  (e). Let [formula] be positive semi-definite operators such that ηj = Aρj, [formula], are rank-one operators in general position. First, let us remark that we can assume that ρj are density states, since proportionality plays no role here. Second, we can assume further that they are pure. Indeed, if ρ is a state with the spectral decomposition [formula] into a convex combination of pure states ξk and if Aρ  =  η is rank-one positive semi-definite operator, then [formula] is a convex combination of rank-one positive semi-definite operators Aξk, so η is positively proportional to Aξk for all k, since pure states are extreme points in the convex body of all states. By a similar argument, all states [formula], [formula], are proportional to ηj, say [formula], where, of course, [formula].

Let us write [formula], [formula], [formula], for some vectors [formula], [formula]. We claim that the states [formula] are in general position, i.e. any n among the vectors [formula] are linearly independent.

For, assume the contrary, i.e. that, say [formula], are linearly dependent. Hence, one of the vectors, say [formula], can be written as a linear combination [formula]. Since [formula] is proportional to [formula], the vector [formula] is proportional to [formula] for [formula]. In particular, all the vectors [formula] with [formula] and [formula], belong to the linear span [formula] of the vectors [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Since [formula] is proportional to [formula], and [formula] are linearly independent, we have [formula] for all [formula]. But this contradicts the property Aρn  =  ηn, i.e. [formula].

(e)⇒  (a). Put [formula], [formula] for some [formula], [formula]. Since ηj = Aρj is of rank one, all the positive semi-definite operators [formula] of its decomposition

[formula]

must be proportional to ηj, [formula]. This, in turn, means that [formula] are proportional to [formula],

[formula]

As any n vectors of [formula] are linearly independent, all the coefficients aj of the decomposition

[formula]

are non-zero, aj  ≠  0. Since

[formula]

are proportional to [formula] and [formula] has a decomposition [formula] into a linear combination of linearly independent [formula], the vector [formula] must be proportional to [formula]. In consequence, it means that the operators [formula] are proportional to the operator [formula] uniquely defined by the conditions

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

for some [formula] and, clearly, β  ≠  0.

If a CP operator

[formula]

is trace-preserving (resp., unity-preserving) and such that the image of density states A(D) contains n + 1 pure states in general position, then A is unitary, [formula].

It is enough to make use of Theorem [\ref=theo:1] and observe that trace-preserving (unity-preserving) yields VV† = I (resp., V†V = I), so V is unitary.

Extreme bistochastic CP maps

Extreme unity-preserving CP maps have been described by Man-Duen Choi [\cite=choi75]. We can reformulate his result as follows.

We will sketch a proof making use of the Jamioł kowski isomorphism ([\ref=j]) which associates with the CP map ([\ref=bi]) the Hermitian operator

[formula]

on gl(H). Extreme normalized CP operators correspond therefore, via the Jamioł kowski isomorphism, to pure states on the Hilbert space gl(H). On the space u*(gl(H)) of Hermitian operators acting on the Hilbert space gl(H), in turn, we can define two canonical [formula]-linear maps F1,F2:u*(gl(H))  →  u*(H) which associate with rank-one operators [formula] the operators [formula] and [formula], respectively. The unity-preserving CP operators A correspond therefore to Hermitian operators constrained by the equations F1(J(A)) = I. The corresponding extreme points J(A)∈u*(gl(H)) need not be pure states. It suffices that the level sets of I of the linear constraint F1 are transversal to the face of the point, i.e. the function F1 has the trivial kernel on the tangent space TJ(A) of the face at J(A). But this tangent space is known (see e.g. [\cite=gkm05] [\cite=grabowski06]) to consists of all Hermitian operators with the range equal to the range of J(A), i.e. the operators of the form [formula], where [formula] is a Hermitian matrix. Hence A is extremal in NCPI(H) if and only if

[formula]

for all Hermitian [formula]. As we can decompose any operator into the sum of a Hermitian and an antihermitian ones, we can rewrite ([\ref=choi]) in gl(H) instead of u*(H) using an arbitrary complex matrix [formula]. This is nothing but the complex linear independence of the operators [formula] in gl(H). For trace-preserving CP operators the reasoning is identical with the function F2 replacing F1.

The maps from [formula] are sometimes called bistochastic. The above understanding of the Choi's result gives us easily a characterization of extreme bistochastic maps.

The proof is analogous to the above one with the difference that our constraint function is now

[formula]

The condition ([\ref=choi]) is therefore replaced by the condition

[formula]

We can rewrite it as

[formula]

and pass to an arbitrary complex [formula] like before.

Examples

Let us illustrate some of the previous reasonings and results in the simplest cases of maps on states on two- and three-dimensional spaces. In the following subsection we show three examples of extreme maps: a generic one possessing exactly two pure states in its image, a non-generic one with only one pure state in the image, and an extreme map having a continuous family of pure states in the image. The last one, according to Theorem [\ref=theo:2], is not completely positive but a merely positive extreme map. Note that these cases have been considered also in [\cite=ruskai02].

In the second subsection we give an example of an extreme completely positive map acting on [formula] which does not have any pure state in its image. Such a situation is impossible for maps acting on qubits (i.e. maps on [formula]).

Extreme completely positive, positive, stochastic and bistochastic maps for n = 2

A state on [formula] can be parameterized by a unit vector [formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

A positive trace-preserving map

[formula]

is thus determined (up to rotations which are irrelevant from the point of view of this paper) by four parameters λ1,λ2,λ3,t, such that

[formula]

The parameters λ1,λ2,λ3,t must fulfil particular conditions to ensure the positivity of the map (see [\cite=fujiwara99], [\cite=ruskai02] for details).

The image of the unit sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 under ([\ref=2dimmap]) is the ellipsoid

[formula]

Obviously, for a positive map ([\ref=2dimmap]) the ellipsoid is inside the unit sphere. For extreme maps it has to have points on its surface common with the surface of the unit sphere (i.e. some pure states are mapped into pure states). For extreme CP maps two possibilities occur [\cite=ruskai02]:

λ1  =   cos (u), λ2  =   cos (v), λ3  =   cos (u) cos (v), t =  sin (u) sin (v), < 0 < u < v. In this case the ellipsoid ([\ref=ell]) has three different axes and it touches the unit sphere at two points (see Fig. [\ref=fig:cp-extreme-generic]).

λ1  =  λ2  =   cos (u), λ3  =   cos 2(u), t =  sin 2(u), in which case the ellipsoid ([\ref=ell]) touches the unit sphere at a single point x = y = 0, z = 1. (see Fig. [\ref=fig:cp-extreme-singular]).

Geometrically it is obvious that without upsetting the extremality of the map we can make the ellipsoid ([\ref=ell]) touching the unit sphere along a full circle (see Fig. [\ref=fig:ncp-extreme]). In this case

[formula]

For u  ≠  0  ≠  v the map is definitely not a unitary one (its image is a proper subset of the unit sphere) and in its image there are more than 3 pure states (in fact the whole circle of states at which the ellipsoid touches the unit sphere). From Theorem [\ref=theo:2] it follows thus that the map cannot be a completely positive one. Indeed, for the chosen values of λ1,λ2,λ3, and t the map is an extreme positive [\cite=gorini76]. The fact that it is not completely positive can be checked independently by finding that its image under the Jamiołkowski isomorphism [\cite=jamiolkowski72] is not positive semi-definite.

An extreme completely positive map having no pure states in its image

Let us consider a CP map on [formula] defined by the following Kraus operators

[formula]

A straightforward calculation gives [formula].

For α = 0 the matrices [formula] form a basis in the space of 3  ×  3 matrices, hence it is also true for small α. The map [formula] is thus an extreme CP map (theorem [\ref=choi1]). For α  ≠  0 there is no [formula] such that [formula] for some [formula] and i = 1,2,3, hence A does not send any pure state into a pure one.
