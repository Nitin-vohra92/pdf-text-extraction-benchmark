Geometric Characteristics of Dynamic Correlations for Combinatorial Regulation in Gene Expression Noise

Cells live in a complex environment and continuously have to make decisions for different signals that they sense. A challenge in systems biology is to understand how signals are integrated. As the central information-processing units of living cells, transcription regulatory networks allow them to integrate different signals and generate specific responses of genes. The elementary computations are performed at the cis-regulatory regions of the genes: the transcription rate of each gene (the output) is a function of the active concentrations of each of the input transcription factors (TFs) [\cite=AlonBook]. Such a quantitative mapping between the regulator concentrations and the output of the regulated gene is known as the cis-regulatory input function (CRIF), which can be functioned as implementations of Boolean logic [\cite=Glass73] [\cite=Arkin94] in analogy to Boolean calculations that basic electronic devices perform [\cite=Margolin05]. For example, two activators regulate a gene with AND or OR logic operation (refer Fig. 1). The notion of logic operations can also be generalized by introducing a continuous function that encodes the dependence of the rate of transcription on the concentrations of inputs [\cite=AlonBook]. Knowing which mode of combinatorial regulation that a gene employs is important for determining its function in regulatory networks. For example, the cis-regulatory module drives cellular patterns differently depending on how the gene integrates intracellular and extracellular signals at its regulatory region by endogenous and exogenous TFs [\cite=Yuh98] [\cite=Zhang09].

Experiments performed on single cells have revealed that because TFs are often present in low copy numbers, stochastic fluctuations or noise in the concentrations of these molecules can have significant influences on gene regulation [\cite=Elowitz02] [\cite=Blake03] [\cite=Kaern05] [\cite=Zhou05]. The traditional fluctuation-dissipation relation derived by the linear noise approach [\cite=Kapmen92] based on the mater equation gives the information only about the second-order moments. Recently, a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation was derived by Warmflash and Dinner [\cite=Warmflash08], which relates some third-order moments evaluated at the system steady state to the derivatives of a CRIF. Such a static cross correlation provides the information only about how three time series are correlated at the zero correlation time. From viewpoints of gene regulation, however, the binding of TFs to the DNA is context dependent, active in some genetic states but not in others. In particular, stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate from active inputs to the outputs of regulated genes during signal integration. Thus, dynamic cross correlations [\cite=Arkin97] [\cite=Dunlop08] would provide a noninvasive means to probe modes of combinatorial regulation in gene expression noise. The purpose of this Letter is to demonstrate its potentials in detecting signatures of combinatorial interaction. Regarding the study of combinatorial regulation, there are other works [\cite=Creighton03] [\cite=Chen07] [\cite=Pilpel01] [\cite=Tsai05] [\cite=Gertz09]. Usually, these papers used some real time-course microarray data to test their algorithms and identify some synergistic TFs.

Before presenting our analysis, let us examine a real biological example. Consider a genetic circuit based on the phage-λ operon [\cite=Warmflash08] [\cite=Joung94]. The corresponding biochemical reactions are listed in the Supporting Material [\cite=supp], wherein how intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources generate are explained. We first perform realistic stochastic simulations of the whole circuit by using biologically reasonable parameter values and obtain three time series data of input TFs S1(t) and S2(t) and the output S0(t) [\cite=Gillespie76]. We expect these simulations to faithfully reflect the biological system because the phage-λ is a well-studied system for which many parameters are measured and comparable models are capable of accurately reproducing distributions of protein concentrations in prokaryotic systems [\cite=Guido06] [\cite=Mettetal06]. Then, according to Ref. [\cite=supp], we calculate dynamic cross-correlation functions Rs1s2,s0(τ) for AND and OR operations, respectively. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the normalized dynamic cross-correlation function R(τ) on the correlation time τ. Apparently, the correlation curve near the peak point close to the zero correlation time is upwards convex for AND operation and downwards convex for OR operation, whichever the sources of noise (intrinsic or extrinsic noise).

Such an anti-correlation relationship between the convexity of dynamic cross-correlation functions for AND and OR operations is not a casual finding but is a general fact. In what follows, we will analytically verify this point using a simple yet general model as schematized in Fig. 1. The corresponding biochemical processes are modeled with the production and degradation of the TFs and the output only

[formula]

where S1 and S2, both of which are activators, represent the TF inputs to cis-regulatory module, S0 is the measured output of the regulated gene, and arrows from and to [formula] denote synthesis and degradation, respectively. The production rate of S0 is determined by the concentrations of the TFs and is encoded in the (dimensionless) cis-regulatory input function CRIF(S1,S2) (see Ref. [\cite=supp] for its analytic form).

Note that the accurate modeling of the system (1) should adopt the master equation [\cite=Kapmen92], but to show our analytic results, we instead take the following simplified Langevin equations

[formula]

Such an approximation can still describe well the motion of individual species molecules under some ideal conditions (see Ref. [\cite=supp] for interpretations). The above equations include terms for protein production rate (αi,  i = 0,1,2), protein degradation and dilution rate (βi,  i = 0,1,2), and the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources (Ii  (i = 0,1,2) and E respectively). Here, the extrinsic noise E is defined as a stochastic fluctuation to globally measured components, whereas the intrinsic noise is assumed as stochastic fluctuations in the gene expression. Noise sources are modeled using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes by

[formula]

Assume that the white noise terms ηE, η1, η2 and η0 are independent, identically distributed processes with the zero mean and the unit standard deviation. The parameters βi and κi define the time scale of the noise, while σE and σi  (i = 0,1,2) set the standard deviation.

We expect perturbations due to noise to be so small that it might be valid to approximate our system using the second-order Taylor expansion of CRIF at the origin system. Denote Seqi  =  αi  /  βi    (i = 1,2). Define si = Si - Seqi  (i = 0,1,2), where [formula] with [formula] in which the outside bracket represents the average over the time t, and g11, g12, g22 are 2-order derivatives of the function CRIF with respect to variables S1 and S2, evaluated at the point (Seq1,Seq2). This will result in the following equations

[formula]

For simplicity, we assume β  =  βi and κ  =  κi  (i = 0,1,2), and without loss of generality, also assume β  ≠  κ, [formula] in the following analysis. By calculation, we find a0 = (g11 + 2g12 + g22)σ2E / (8β3) + (g11σ22 + g22σ22) / (4βκ(β  +  κ)).

Finally, define the dynamic cross correlation between s0(t) and s1(t), s2(t) as

[formula]

where τ represents the correlation time. In simulations, this function is normalized to [formula]. By complex calculations, we obtain the analytic expression of the unnormalized dynamic cross-correlation function [\cite=supp], denoted by Rint(τ), in the presence of intrinsic noise only, where [formula]. Note that the sign of g12 is opposite for the AND and OR operations (see Ref. [\cite=supp]). The simple analysis shows that Rint(τ) has one peak at some small τm > 0. In particular, the convexity of Rint(τ) at a small interval of τm > 0 but close to τ = 0 is anti-correlative for the two logic operations, referring Fig. 3(a).

In the simultaneous presence of extrinsic and intrinsic noise, the total unnormalized cross-correlation function can be expressed in the form of R(τ) = Rint(τ) + Rext(τ) + Rmix(τ), where Rext(τ) represents the dynamic cross correlation in the case of extrinsic noise only and Rmix(τ) represents the cross terms due to the cooperative effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. The analytic expressions of Rext(τ) and Rmix(τ) are put in Ref. [\cite=supp]. Figure 3(a) shows that the extrinsic noise does not influence the convexity of the correlation function R(τ) for both logic operations, where the theoretical results are in good accord with the numerical results. Note that there is a difference in the effect of extrinsic noise on the location of the dynamic cross-correlation curve between Figs. 2 and 3(a) in the case of OR operation. That is, extrinsic noise uplifts the dynamic cross-correlation curve in Fig. 2, but it moves down the dynamic cross-correlation curve in Fig. 3(a). This is possibly because for the modeled system, the additive noise of capturing the effect of external fluctuations does not depend on the state variables whereas for the real system, the extrinsic noise that appears actually in the relevant Langevin equation is dependent of the state variables [\cite=Gillespie00]. Figure 3(b) further shows that the convexity of R(τ) is robust to noise in the active region of the two input signals (here, by the active region we mean that concentrations of the input signals are beyond 20% of their maximal values [\cite=Goldbeter81]). This is because the 2-order derivative of R(τ) evaluated at the peak point, denoted by R''(τm), the sign of which describes the local convexity of R(τ), is always negative (i.e., upwards convex) for the AND operation whereas positive (i.e., downwards convex) for the OR operation in this active region.

In conclusion, we have shown that the dynamic cross-correlation functions for AND and OR operations in gene expression noise have apparently distinct geometric characteristics (convexity). Such a difference is qualitative, depending neither on specific models nor on the sources of noise, and hence the essential difference reflected by the modes of combinatorial regulation. Moreover, since the dynamic correlation function utilizes statistics of the naturally arising fluctuations in the copy number of the species, its geometric characteristics can in turn help us efficiently detect signatures of combinatorial regulation with available experimental data. This is useful because proximity in DNA binding is not sufficient to infer combinatorial interactions, and they cannot be readily probed by traditional methods (e.g., knockouts) or high-throughput expression assays (e.g., microarray data).

Since stochastic fluctuations, or noise, exist inherently in biochemical reactions, using noise rather than external interference means to mine bioinformation related to gene regulation provides a new research line. Regarding this aspect, there have been some works, e.g., Cox et al. used noise to characterize some genetic circuits [\cite=Cox08], Dunlop et al. used correlation in gene expression noise to reveal the activity states of regulatory links [\cite=Dunlop08], Warmflash and Dinner used static cross correlations to detect signatures of combinatorial regulation in intrinsic biological noise [\cite=Warmflash08]. We utilized dynamic cross correlations based on the nature of noise correlation to identify the modes of combinatorial regulation in intrinsic or extrinsic noise or both. In contrast to Warmflash and Dinner's approach, our approach would have some advantages since dynamic cross correlations can in general provide more information about gene-gene correlation in expression than static cross correlations.

The method of dynamic cross correlation can also be extended to other situations of logic operations (ANDN, ORN, NAND, NOR). For example, consider a system with two input TFs and the output of a gene. If both TFs are activators, this case has been studied in this paper; If both are repressors, our method can still show that the dynamic correlation function R(τ) is upwards convex for NOR whereas downwards convex for NAND; If one TF is activator and the other is repressor, the R(τ) is upwards convex for ANDN whereas downwards convex for ORN. In the cases of XOR and EQU, however, the approach will be invalid since the input TFs may be activator or repressor. Except for inferring synergies between regulators, the idea of dynamic correlation (e.g., 2-point dynamic cross correlations introduced in Ref. [\cite=Dunlop08] [\cite=Nolte08]) can even be used to determine the direction and relationship of interactions between arbitrary two regulators, i.e., to determine who regulates whom and who activates/represses whom. The details will be discussed elsewhere. Finally, the approach of dynamic cross correlation can be applied to other biological networks, e.g., RNA logic devices [\cite=Win08], nucleic acid logic circuits [\cite=Seelig06], signaling protein logic modules [\cite=Prehoda00], to identify the types of logic operations.
