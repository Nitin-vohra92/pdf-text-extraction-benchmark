Completely splittable representations of affine Hecke-Clifford algebras

Introduction

Let [formula] be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p and denote by Sn the symmetric group on n letters. In [\cite=M], Mathieu gave the dimension of the irreducible [formula]-modules associated to the partitions [formula] of n with length l and λ1  -  λl  ≤  (l - p) by using the well-known Schur-Weyl duality. Subsequently, Kleshchev [\cite=K1] showed that these representations are exactly these whose restrictions to the subgroup Sk are semi-simple for any k  ≤  n or equivalently on which the Jucys-Murphy elements in [formula] act semisimply. These [formula]-modules are called completely splittable in [\cite=K1]. By using the modular branching rules for [formula] (cf. [\cite=K2]), a formula for the dimensions of completely splittable modules was obtained in terms of the paths in Young modular graphs, which recovers Mathieu's result [\cite=M]. Generalizing the work in [\cite=K1] [\cite=M], Ruff [\cite=Ru] formulated and classified the irreducible completely splittable representations of degenerate affine Hecke algebras Hn (introduced by Drinfeld [\cite=Dr] and Lusztig [\cite=Lus]). Over the complex field [formula], these Hn-modules were constructed and classified originally by Cherednik [\cite=C1]. Generalizations were established to affine Hecke algebras of type A in [\cite=C2] and Ram [\cite=Ra] and to Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras in [\cite=KR].

From now on let us assume p  ≠  2. This paper aims to classify and construct completely splittable representations of affine Hecke-Clifford algebras [formula] over [formula]. The algebra [formula] was introduced by Nazarov [\cite=Na2](called affine Sergeev algebra) to study the spin (or projective) representations of the symmetric group Sn or equivalently to study the representations of the spin symmetric group algebra [formula]. Our construction is a generalization of Young's seminormal construction of the irreducible representations of symmetric groups and affine Hecke algebras of type A (cf. [\cite=C2] [\cite=Ra]). The approach is similar in spirit to the technique introduced by Okounkov and Vershik [\cite=OV] on symmetric groups over [formula].

Let us denote by [formula] the polynomial generators of the algebra [formula] (cf. subsection [\ref=basicofAHCa] for the definition). According to Brundan and Kleshchev [\cite=BK] (cf. [\cite=K2]), one can reduce the study of the finite dimensional [formula]-modules to these so-called integral modules on which the eigenvalues of [formula] are of the form q(i) for [formula] (cf. ([\ref=defn:I]) and ([\ref=qi]) for notations). Then each finite dimensional [formula]-module M admits a decomposition as [formula] where [formula] is the simultaneous generalized eigenspace for the commuting operators [formula] corresponding to the eigenvalues [formula]. We call [formula] a weight of M if [formula]. By definition, a finite dimensional [formula]-module is completely splittable if the polynomial generators [formula] act semisimply.

Our work is based on several equivalent characterizations (cf. Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.] for precise statements) of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules. In particular, an irreducible [formula]-module is completely splittable if and only if its restriction to the subalgebra [formula] (cf. subsection [\ref=basicofAHCa] for notations) is semisimple for any 1  ≤  r  ≤  n. It follows that any irreducible completely splittable [formula]-module is semisimple on restriction to the subalgebra of [formula] generated by sk,ck,ck + 1,xk,xk + 1 (cf. subsection [\ref=basicofAHCa] for notations) which is isomorphic to [formula] for fixed 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. By exploring irreducible [formula]-modules, we obtain an explicit description of the action of the simple transpositions sk on irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules and identify all possible weights of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules. This leads to the construction of a family of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules. It turns out that these modules exhaust the non-isomorphic irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules. We further show that these representations are parameterized by skew shifted Young diagrams with precise constraints depending on p and give a dimension formula in terms of the associated standard Young tableaux. We remark that in the special case when p = 0, our result confirms a conjecture of Wang and it has been independently obtained by Hill, Kujawa, and Sussan [\cite=HKS].

Denote by Yn the finite Hecke-Clifford algebra [formula], where Cn is the Clifford algebra over [formula] generated by [formula] subject to the relations c2k = 1,ckcl =  - clck for 1  ≤  k  ≠  l  ≤  n. A Yn-module is called completely splittable if the Jucys-Murphy elements [formula] (cf. ([\ref=JM]) for notations) act semisimply. There exists a surjective homomorphism (cf. [\cite=Na2]) from [formula] to Yn which maps xk to the Jucys-Murphy elements Lk for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. By applying the results established for [formula] to Yn, we classify irreducible completely splittable Yn-modules and obtain a dimension formula for these modules. We understand that an unpublished work of Kleshchev and Ruff independently gave the classification of irreducible completely splittable Yn-modules. In [\cite=BK], irreducible representations of Yn over [formula] are shown to be parameterized by p-restricted p-strict partitions of n. In this paper, we identify the subset Γ of p-restricted p-strict partitions of n which parameterizes irreducible completely splittable Yn-modules. This together with a well-known Morita super-equivalence between the spin symmetric group algebra [formula] and Yn leads to an interesting family of irreducible [formula]-modules parameterized by Γ for which dimensions and characters can be explicitly described. In the special case when p = 0, we recover the main result of [\cite=Na1] on the seminormal construction of all simple representations of [formula].

We observe that the L2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semsimply on the basic spin Yn-module I(n) (cf. [\cite=BK]) which is not completely splittable. On the other hand, Wang [\cite=W] introduced the degenerate spin affine Hecke-Clifford algebras [formula] and established an isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] which sends x2k to 2b2k (cf. Section [\ref=aLc] for notations). As the generators [formula] are anti-commutative, it is reasonable to study the [formula]-modules on which the commuting operators [formula] act semisimply. This is equivalent to studying [formula]-modules on which x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply by using the isomorphism between [formula] and [formula]. Motivated by these observations, we study and obtain a necessary condition in terms of weights for the classification of irreducible [formula]-modules on which x2k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply; moreover, this condition is conjectured to be sufficient, and the conjecture is verified when n = 2,3.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=AHCa], we recall some basics about superalgebra and also the affine Hecke-Clifford algebras [formula]. In Section [\ref=wofCS], we analyze the structure of completely splittable [formula]-modules by studying their weights and a classification of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules is obtained in Section [\ref=classification]. In Section [\ref=combinatorics], we give a reinterpretation for weights of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules in terms of shifted Young diagrams. In Section [\ref=fHCa], we classify the irreducible completely splittable representations of finite Hecke-Clifford algebras. Finally, in Section [\ref=aLc] we introduce a larger category consisting of [formula]-modules on which x2k act semisimply and state a conjecture for classification of modules in this larger category.

Affine Hecke-Clifford algebras [formula]

Recall that [formula] is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p with p  ≠  2. Denote by [formula] the set of nonnegative integers and let

[formula]

Some basics about superalgebras

We shall recall some basic notions of superalgebras, referring the reader to [\cite=BK]. Let us denote by [formula] the parity of a homogeneous vector v of a vector superspace. By a superalgebra, we mean a [formula]-graded associative algebra. Let A be a superalgebra. A A-module means a [formula]-graded left A-module. A homomorphism f:V  →  W of A-modules V and W means a linear map such that f(av) = ( - 1)āaf(v). Note that this and other such expressions only make sense for homogeneous a,f and the meaning for arbitrary elements is to be obtained by extending linearly from the homogeneous case. Let V be a finite dimensional A-module. Let ΠV be the same underlying vector space but with the opposite [formula]-grading. The new action of a∈A on v∈ΠV is defined in terms of the old action by a  ·  v: = ( - 1)āav. Note that the identity map on V defines an isomorphism from V to ΠV.

A superalgebra analog of Schur's Lemma states that the endomorphism algebra of a finite dimensional irreducible module over a superalgebra is either one dimensional or two dimensional. In the former case, we call the module of type M while in the latter case the module is called of type Q.

Given two superalgebras A and B, we view the tensor product of superspaces [formula] as a superalgebra with multiplication defined by

[formula]

Suppose V is an A-module and W is a B-module. Then [formula] affords [formula]-module denoted by [formula] via

[formula]

If V is an irreducible A-module and W is an irreducible B-module, [formula] may not be irreducible. Indeed, we have the following standard lemma (cf. [\cite=K1]).

Let V be an irreducible A-module and W be an irreducible B-module.

If both V and W are of type [formula], then [formula] is an irreducible [formula]-module of type [formula].

If one of V or W is of type [formula] and the other is of type [formula], then [formula] is an irreducible [formula]-module of type [formula].

If both V and W are of type [formula], then [formula] for a type [formula] irreducible [formula]-module X.

Moreover, all irreducible [formula]-modules arise as constituents of [formula] for some choice of irreducibles V,W.

If V is an irreducible A-module and W is an irreducible B-module, denote by [formula] an irreducible component of [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Affine Hecke-Clifford algebras [formula]

Now we proceed to define the superalgebra we will be interested in. For [formula], the affine Hecke-Clifford algebra [formula] is the superalgebra generated by even generators [formula] and odd generators [formula] subject to the following relations

[formula]

The affine Hecke-Clifford algebra [formula] was introduced by Nazarov [\cite=Na2](called affine Sergeev algebra) to study the representations of [formula]. The quantized version of the [formula] introduced later by Jones-Nazarov [\cite=JN] to study the q-analogues of Young symmetrizers for projective representations of the symmetric group Sn is often also called affine Hecke-Clifford algebras.

For [formula] and [formula], set [formula] and [formula]. Then we have the following.

[\cite=BK] The set [formula] forms a basis of [formula].

Denote by [formula] the superalgebra generated by even generators [formula] and odd generators [formula] subject to the relations ([\ref=poly]), ([\ref=clifford]) and ([\ref=xc]). By Lemma [\ref=lem:PBW], [formula] can be identified with the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] and [formula]. For a composition [formula] of n, we define [formula] to be the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] and [formula]. Note that [formula]. For each [formula], set

[formula]

Let us denote by [formula] the category of so-called integral finite dimensional [formula]-modules on which the [formula] have eigenvalues of the form q(i) for [formula]. For each [formula], denote by L(i) the 2-dimensional [formula]-module with [formula] and [formula] and

[formula]

Note that L(i) is irreducible of type [formula] if i  ≠  0, and irreducible of type [formula] if i = 0. Moreover [formula] form a complete set of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-module in the category [formula]. Observe that [formula], and hence we have the following result by Lemma [\ref=tensorsmod].

[\cite=BK] The [formula]-modules

[formula]

forms a complete set of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-module in the category [formula]. Moreover, denote by γ0 the number of 1  ≤  j  ≤  n with ij = 0. Then L() is of type [formula] if γ0 is even and type [formula] if γ0 is odd. Furthermore, [formula], where [formula] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to [formula] .

Note that each permutation τ∈Sn defines a superalgebra isomorphism [formula] by mapping xk to xτ(k) and ck to cτ(k), for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. For [formula], the twist of the action of [formula] on L() with τ- 1 leads to a new [formula]-module denoted by L()τ with

[formula]

So in particular we have (xkz)τ = xτ(k)zτ and (ckz)τ = cτ(k)zτ. It is easy to see that [formula], where [formula] for [formula] and τ∈Sn.

Intertwining elements for [formula].

Following [\cite=Na2], we define the intertwining elements as

[formula]

It is known that

[formula]

for all admissible j,k,l with l  ≠  k,k + 1 and |j - k| > 1.

Weights of completely splittable [formula]-modules

In this section, we shall describe the weights of completely splittable [formula]-modules.

Structure of completely splittable [formula]-modules.

For [formula] and [formula], set

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula] is called a weight of M and [formula] is called a weight space. Since the polynomial generators [formula] commute, we have

[formula]

For [formula] and 1  ≤  m  ≤  n, set

[formula]

One can show using ([\ref=px1]) that

[formula]

Hence Θim defines an exact functor

[formula]

Moreover as [formula]-modules, we have

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula], define

[formula]

[\cite=BK] Suppose that [formula] is irreducible. Let [formula] and m = εi(M). Then ΘimM is isomorphic to [formula] for some irreducible [formula] with εi(L) = 0.

A representation of [formula] is called completely splittable if [formula] act semisimply.

Observe that if [formula] is completely splittable, then for [formula],

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] is completely splittable and that [formula] for some [formula]. Then ik  ≠  ik + 1 for all 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

Suppose ik = ik + 1 for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. Let [formula]. Since M is completely splittable, (x2k - q(ik))z = 0 = (x2k + 1 - q(ik + 1))z. This together with ([\ref=reln:x2s1]) shows that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Similarly, we see that

[formula]

Hence [formula]. By Remark [\ref=rem:genera.], we deduce that (x2k - q(ik))skz = 0 and therefore

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

This means q(ik + 1) =  - q(ik) and hence q(ik) = q(ik + 1) = 0 since ik = ik + 1. Therefore x2k = 0 = x2k + 1 on [formula]. Since xk,xk + 1 act semisimply on [formula], xk = 0 = xk + 1 on [formula]. This implies xk + 1skz = 0 since [formula] as shown above. Then

[formula]

This means 2z = (1 - ckck + 1)(1 + ckck + 1)z = 0. Hence z = 0 since p  ≠  2. This contradicts the assumption that z  ≠  0.

Suppose that [formula] is completely splittable. Then εi(M)  ≤  1 for any [formula].

Let [formula] be irreducible. The following are equivalent.

M is completely splittable.

For any [formula] with [formula], we have ik  ≠  ik + 1 for all 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

The restriction [formula] is semisimple for any 1  ≤  r  ≤  n.

For any [formula] with [formula], we have [formula] as [formula]-modules.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.], (1) implies (2). Suppose (2) holds, then by Lemma [\ref=lem:K1-1] and Corollary [\ref=cor:variM] we have ΘiM is either zero or irreducible for each [formula] and hence by ([\ref=decomp.2]) [formula] is semisimple. Observe that if [formula] for some irreducible [formula], then (2) also holds for N. This implies [formula] is semisimple. Therefore [formula] is semisimple by ([\ref=decomp.2]). Continuing in this way we see that the restriction [formula] is semisimple for any 1  ≤  r  ≤  n, whence (3).

Now assume (3) holds. In particular [formula] is semisimple, that is, M is isomorphic to a direct sum of L() as [formula]-modules. It is clear that [formula] act semisimply on L() for each [formula], whence (1).

Clearly (1) holds if (4) is true. Now suppose (1) holds and we shall prove (4) by induction on n. Suppose [formula] for some [formula]. Observe that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:K1-1] and Corollary [\ref=cor:variM], [formula] for some irreducible [formula]. This means [formula], where [formula]. Note that N is completely splittable and hence by induction [formula]. Therefore [formula].

Note that [formula] possesses an automorphism σn which sends sk to - sn - k, xl to xn + 1 - l and cl to cn + 1 - l for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1 and 1  ≤  l  ≤  n. Moreover σn induces an algebra isomorphism for each composition [formula] of n

[formula]

where [formula]. Given [formula], we can twist with σμ to get a [formula]-module Mσμ. Observe that for [formula]-module M, we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] is irreducible completely splittable if and only if [formula] is semisimple for any 1  ≤  r  ≤  n by Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.].

Let [formula] be irreducible completely splittable. Then the restriction [formula] is semisimple for any 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. Hence M is semisimple on restriction to the subalgebra generated by sk,xk,xk + 1,ck,ck + 1 which is isomorphic to [formula] for fixed 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.], [formula] is semisimple. Hence

[formula]

is semisimple by Remark [\ref=rem:twist].

The weight constraints.

Suppose that [formula] is completely splittable and that [formula] for some [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.], ik  ≠  ik + 1 for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. It follows from Remark [\ref=rem:genera.] that x2k - x2k + 1 acts as the nonzero scalar q(ik) - q(ik + 1) on [formula] for each 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. So we define linear operators Ξk and Ωk on [formula] such that for any [formula],

[formula]

Both Ξk and Ωk make sense as linear operators on L() for [formula] whenever ik  ≠  ik + 1 for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n.

The following holds for [formula].

If i = j  ±  1, then the irreducible [formula]-module [formula] affords an irreducible [formula]-module denoted by V(i,j) with the action [formula] for any [formula]. The [formula]-module V(i,j) has the same type as the [formula]-module [formula]. Moreover, it is always completely splittable.

If i  ≠  j  ±  1, the [formula]-module [formula] is irreducible and has the same type as the [formula]-module [formula]. It is completely splittable if and only if i  ≠  j (and recall [formula]).

Every irreducible module in the category [formula] is isomorphic to some V(i,j).

(1). It is routine to check s1x1 = x2s1 - (1 + c1c2) and s1c1 = c2s1, hence it remains to prove s21 = 1 on V(i,j). Indeed, for [formula], we have

[formula]

where the last identity follows from the definition of q(i) and the assumption i = j  ±  1. It is clear that [formula]. Hence V(i,j) has the same type as the [formula]-module [formula]. Since x1,x2 act semisimply on [formula], V(i,j) is completely splittable.

(2). Assume that [formula] and that M is a nonzero proper submodule of [formula]. Observe that [formula] as vector spaces. Without loss of generality, we can assume M contains a nonzero vector v of the form [formula] or [formula] for some [formula]. Otherwise, we can replace v by v + s1v or v - s1v since either of them is nonzero. By ([\ref=reln:x2s1]),

[formula]

This together with (x21 - q(j))v∈M shows that

[formula]

Since [formula] and M is a proper [formula]-submodule of V(i,j), we have

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

This together with (x1(1 - c1c2) + (1 - c1c2)x2)2u = 2(x21 + x22)u shows that

[formula]

This contradicts the assumption i  ≠  j  ±  1 and hence V(i,j) is irreducible.

Note that if i  ≠  j, then V(i,j) has two weights, that is, (i,j) and (j,i). By Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.], we see that [formula] is semisimple and is isomorphic to the direct sum of [formula] and [formula]. This means

[formula]

By Frobenius reciprocity we obtain

[formula]

Hence V(i,j) has the same type as the [formula]-module [formula].

Now suppose i = j. This implies that (i,i) is a weight of V(i,i) and hence V(i,i) is not completely splittable by Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.], [formula] is not semisimple. Note that [formula] has two composition factors and both of them are isomorphic to [formula]. Therefore the socle of [formula] is simple and isomorphic to [formula]. Hence [formula]. By Frobenius reciprocity we obtain

[formula]

Hence V(i,i) has the same type as the [formula]-module [formula].

(3). Suppose [formula] is irreducible, then there exist [formula] such that [formula]. By Frobenius reciprocity M is an irreducible quotient of the induced module [formula]. If i  ≠  j  ±  1, then [formula] since [formula] is irreducible by (2); otherwise using the fact that Ξ21 = 1 on [formula] one can show that the vector space

[formula]

is a [formula]-submodule of [formula] and it is isomorphic to V(j,i). It is easy to check the quotient [formula] is isomorphic to V(i,j). Hence [formula].

Observe from the proof above that if [formula] then the completely splittable [formula]-module V(i,j) has two weights (i,j) and (j,i) and moreover s1  -  Ξ1 gives a bijection between the associated weight spaces. This together with Corollary [\ref=cor:restr.to_2] and Proposition [\ref=prop:rank_2] leads to the following.

Let [formula] be irreducible completely splittable. Suppose [formula] for some [formula]. The following holds for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

If ik = ik + 1  ±  1, then [formula].

If ik  ≠  ik + 1  ±  1, then [formula] and hence sk  ·   is a weight of M.

Let [formula]. For 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, the simple transposition sk is called admissible with respect to [formula] if [formula].

Let [formula] be the set of weights [formula] of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules. By Corollary [\ref=cor:per._action], if [formula] and sk is admissible with respect to [formula], then [formula]; moreover [formula] and sk  ·   must occur as weights in an irreducible completely splittable [formula]-module simultaneously.

Let [formula]. Suppose that ik = ik + 2 for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2.

If p = 0, then ik = ik + 2 = 0,ik + 1 = 1.

If p  ≥  3, then either ik = ik + 2 = 0,ik + 1 = 1 or [formula].

Suppose [formula] occurs in the irreducible completely splittable [formula]-module M and ik = ik + 2 for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2. If [formula], then sk  ·   is a weight of M with the form [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor:per._action]. This contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.]. Hence ik = ik + 1  ±  1. This together with Corollary [\ref=cor:per._action] shows that sk  =  Ξk and sk + 1  =  Ξk + 1 on [formula] and by ([\ref=xc]) we have

[formula]

on [formula], where a = q(ik) = q(ik + 2) and b = q(ik + 1). This implies that for [formula],

[formula]

On [formula], xk,xk + 2 act semisimply and x2k,x2k + 2 act as scalars q(ik),q(ik + 2). Hence [formula] admits a decomposition [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Applying the identity ([\ref=diffbraid]) to N1 and N2, we obtain

[formula]

By the fact that ik + 1 = ik  ±  1, and the definition of q(ik) and q(ik + 1), one can check that ([\ref=eq.ik]) is equivalent to the following

[formula]

(1). If p = 0, since ik,ik + 1 are nonnegative there is no solution for the equation ([\ref=eq.ik1]) and the solution of ([\ref=eq.ik2]) is ik = 0,ik + 1 = 1.

(2). If p  ≥  3, since [formula] there is no solution for the equation ([\ref=eq.ik1]) and the solutions of ([\ref=eq.ik2]) are ik = 0,ik + 1 = 1 or [formula].

Let [formula]. Suppose ik = il for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n. Then [formula].

Suppose ik = il = u for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n. Without loss of generality, we can assume [formula]. If u = 0, then [formula]; otherwise we can apply admissible transpositions to [formula] to obtain an element in [formula] of the form [formula], which contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.].

Now assume u  ≥  1 and [formula]. If u - 1 does not appear between ik + 1 and il - 1 in [formula], then we can apply admissible transpositions to [formula] to obtain an element in [formula] of the form [formula], which contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.]. If u - 1 appears only once between ik + 1 and il - 1 in [formula], then we can apply admissible transpositions to [formula] to obtain an element in [formula] of the form [formula], which contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.1]. Hence u - 1 appears at least twice between ik + 1 and il - 1 in [formula]. This implies that there exist k < k1 < l1 < l such that

[formula]

An identical argument shows that there exist k1 < k2 < l2 < l1 such that

[formula]

Continuing in this way, we obtain k < s < t < l such that

[formula]

which is impossible as shown at the beginning.

Let [formula]. Then

ik  ≠  ik + 1 for all 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

If p  ≥  3, then [formula] appears at most once in [formula].

If ik = il = 0 for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n, then [formula].

If p = 0 and ik = il  ≥  1 for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n, then [formula].

If p  ≥  3 and ik = il  ≥  1 for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n, then either of the following holds:

[formula],

there exists a sequence of integers [formula] such that [formula] and ik + j does not appear between irj and itj in [formula] for each [formula].

(1). It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:separate_weig.].

(2). If [formula] appears more than once in [formula], then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] that [formula] appears in [formula] which is impossible since [formula].

(3). It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2].

(4). Now suppose p = 0 and ik = il = u  ≥  1 for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n. Without loss of generality, we can assume [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] we have [formula] and hence it suffices to show [formula]. Now assume [formula]. Then u + 1 must appear in the subsequence [formula] at least twice, otherwise we can apply admissible transpositions to [formula] to obtain an element in [formula] of the form [formula] which contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.1]. Hence there exist k < k1 < l1 < l such that

[formula]

Since [formula], a similar argument gives k2,l2 with k1 < k2 < l2 < l1 such that

[formula]

Continuing in this way we see that any integer greater than u will appear in the subsequence [formula] which is impossible. Hence [formula].

(5). Suppose p  ≥  3 and [formula] for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n and [formula]. Clearly there exist k  ≤  r0 < t0  ≤  l such that

[formula]

An identical argument used for proving (2) shows that there exists a sequence of integers

[formula]

such that

[formula]

for each [formula]. Since [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] there exists [formula] such that [formula].

Classification of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules

In this section, we shall give an explicit construction and a classification of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules.

Recall that for [formula] and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, the simple transposition sk is said to be admissible with respect to [formula] if [formula]. Define an equivalence relation ~   on [formula] by declaring that   ~   if there exist [formula] for some [formula] such that [formula] and skl is admissible with respect to [formula] for 1  ≤  l  ≤  t.

Denote by [formula] the set of [formula] satisfying the properties (3), (4) and (5) in Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2]. Observe that if [formula] and sk is admissible with respect to [formula], then the properties in Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2] hold for sk  ·   and hence [formula]. This means there is an equivalence relation denoted by ~   on [formula] inherited from the equivalence relation ~   on [formula]. For each [formula], set

[formula]

Let [formula] and ∈Λ. Then the map

[formula]

is bijective.

By the definitions of [formula] and the equivalence relation ~   on [formula], one can check that φ is surjective. Note that if [formula] then [formula]. Therefore, to check the injectivity of φ, it suffices to show that for [formula] if τ  ·    =   then τ = 1. Associated to each [formula], there exists a unique table Γ() whose ath column consists of all numbers k with jk = a and is increasing for each [formula]. Since [formula], jk  ≠  jk + 1 and hence k and k + 1 are in different columns in Γ() for each 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. This means each simple transposition sk can naturally act on the table Γ() by switching k and k + 1 to obtain a new table denoted by sk  ·  Γ(). It is clear that

[formula]

Since [formula], we can write [formula] so that skl is admissible with respect to [formula] for each 1  ≤  l  ≤  t. Observe that [formula] and hence there exists a table [formula] as defined above for 1  ≤  l  ≤  t. By ([\ref=table]) we have

[formula]

for 1  ≤  l  ≤  t. This implies

[formula]

Therefore τ = 1.

Before stating the main theorem of this section, we need the following two lemmas. Let [formula] be irreducible completely splittable and suppose [formula] for some [formula]. Recall the linear operators Ξk and Ωk on [formula] from ([\ref=Deltak]) and ([\ref=omegak]). If sk is admissible with respect to [formula], then [formula] and hence 2(q(ik) + q(ik + 1))  ≠  (q(ik) - q(ik + 1))2. This implies that on [formula] the linear operator Ωk acts as a nonzero scalar and hence is invertible. Therefore we can define the linear map k as follows:

[formula]

Let [formula] be irreducible completely splittable. Assume that [formula] and that sk is admissible with respect to [formula] for some [formula] and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. Then,

k satisfies

[formula]

for 1  ≤  l  ≤  n with |k - l| > 1. Hence for each [formula], k(z)∈Msk  ·  .

2k = 1, and hence [formula] is a bijection.

[formula]

whenever both sides are well-defined.

(1) Recalling the intertwining element Φk from ([\ref=intertw]), we see that

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=xinter]) and ([\ref=cinter]) implies ([\ref=xinterprime]) and ([\ref=cinterprime]). By ([\ref=xinterprime]), we have for any [formula],

[formula]

This means kz∈Msk  ·  .

(2) By ([\ref=sqinter]) and ([\ref=sDelta]), one can check that for [formula],

[formula]

Hence 2k = 1 and so k is bijective.

(3). If |j - l| > 1 and both jl and lj are well-defined on [formula], then by ([\ref=xinter]) and ([\ref=sDelta]) we see that

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=braidinter]) implies ([\ref=braidprime1]). By ([\ref=sDelta]), one can check that if both kk + 1k and k + 1kk + 1 are well-defined on [formula] then

[formula]

where C is the scalar

[formula]

with a = q(ik),b = q(ik + 1),c = q(ik + 2). Hence ([\ref=braidprime2]) follows from ([\ref=braidinter]).

Suppose that [formula] is completely splittable. By Lemma [\ref=lem:newoperator], if [formula] and   ~  , then [formula].

Let [formula] be irreducible completely splittable. Suppose that [formula] for some [formula] and [formula]. Write [formula] so that skl is admissible with respect to [formula] for 1  ≤  l  ≤  t. Then

[formula]

is a bijection satisfying xkτ  =  τxτ(k) and ckτ  =  τcτ(k) for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Moreover τ does not depend on the choice of the expression [formula] for τ.

Since skl is admissible with respect to [formula] for 1  ≤  l  ≤  t, each kl is a well-defined bijection from Mskl - 1  ·  sk1  ·   to Mskl  ·  sk1  ·   by Lemma [\ref=lem:newoperator] and hence τ is bijective. By ([\ref=braidprime1]) and ([\ref=braidprime2]), τ does not depend on the choice of the expression [formula] for τ. Using ([\ref=xinterprime]) and ([\ref=cinterprime]), we obtain xkτ  =  τxτ(k) and ckτ  =  τcτ(k) for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n.

Suppose [formula]. Recall the definition of L()τ from Remark [\ref=rem:twist] for [formula]. Denote by [formula] the [formula]-module defined by

[formula]

The following theorem is the main result of this paper.

Suppose [formula]. Then,

[formula] affords an irreducible [formula]-module via

[formula]

for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1,z∈L() and [formula]. It has the same type as the irreducible [formula]-module L().

[formula] if and only if   ~  .

Every irreducible completely splittable [formula]-module in [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] for some [formula]. Hence the equivalence classes [formula] parametrize irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules in the category [formula].

(1). To show the formula ([\ref=actionformula]) defines a [formula]-module structure on [formula], we need to check the defining relations ([\ref=braid]), ([\ref=px1]), ([\ref=px2]) and ([\ref=pc]) on L()τ for each [formula]. One can show using ([\ref=xc]) that

[formula]

For 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, (xτ- 1(k)z)skτ = xk + 1zskτ by Remark [\ref=rem:Ltau] and hence if sk is admissible with respect to τ  ·  , then

[formula]

Otherwise we have

[formula]

Therefore ([\ref=px1]) holds. It is routine to check ([\ref=px2]) and ([\ref=pc]).

It remains to prove ([\ref=braid]). It is clear by ([\ref=px2]) that sksl = slsk if |l - k| > 1, so it suffices to prove s2k = 1 and sksk + 1sk = sk + 1sksk + 1. For the remaining of the proof, let us fix [formula] and set   =  τ  ·  . One can check using ([\ref=xc]) and  ([\ref=actionformula]) that

[formula]

Hence if sk is admissible with respect to   =  τ  ·  , then

[formula]

Otherwise we have [formula]. This implies 2(q(jk) + q(jk + 1)) = (q(jk) - q(jk + 1))2 and hence

[formula]

Therefore s2k = 1 on [formula] for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1 . Next we shall prove sksk + 1sk = sk + 1sksk + 1 for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2. Set k = sk  -  Ξk for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. It is clear by ([\ref=actionformula]) that

[formula]

If [formula], [formula] or [formula], then kk + 1k = 0 = k + 1kk + 1 on L()τ; otherwise, one can show using ([\ref=omegak]) that

[formula]

for any z∈L(), where a = q(jk),b = q(jk + 1),c = q(jk + 2). Hence

[formula]

Fix 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2. If jk  ≠  jk + 2, then [formula] acts as the nonzero scalar [formula] on L()τ. Recalling the intertwining elements Φk from ([\ref=intertw]), we see that

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=braidinter]) shows that for any z∈L(),

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence by ([\ref=braid']) we see that for any z∈L(),

[formula]

A tedious calculation shows that

[formula]

Therefore we obtain that if jk  ≠  jk + 2 then

[formula]

Now assume jk = jk + 2, then by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.1] we have either jk = jk + 2 = 0,jk + 1 = 1 or [formula]. Hence sk  =  Ξk and sk + 1  =  Ξk + 1 on L()τ. We see from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.1] that sksk + 1sk = sk + 1sksk + 1. Therefore [formula] affords a [formula]-module by the formula ([\ref=actionformula]).

Suppose N is a nonzero irreducible submodule of [formula], then [formula] for some [formula]. This implies [formula] and hence   ~  . Since τ  ·    ~    ~  , by Remark [\ref=rem:admissible] we see that Nτ  ·    ≠  0 for all [formula]. Observe that [formula] is irreducible as a [formula]-module for [formula]. Therefore [formula] for [formula] and hence [formula]. This means [formula] is irreducible.

We shall show that [formula] has the same type as L(). Suppose [formula]. Note that for each [formula] and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, if sk is admissible with respect to τ  ·  , then for any z∈L(),

[formula]

Since sk is admissible with respect to : = τ  ·  , [formula] and hence Ωk acts as a nonzero scalar on L()skτ. By ([\ref=Psisk]) we see that Ψ(zskτ) is uniquely determined by Ψ(zτ) for any [formula]. Since each τ can be written as [formula] so that skl is admissible with respect to [formula], we deduce Ψ(zτ) is uniquely determined by Ψ(z) for any z∈L(). Therefore Ψ is uniquely determined by its restriction to the [formula]-submodule L(). Clearly the image of restriction of Ψ to L() is contained in L() by Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaP]. This implies

[formula]

One the other hand, it is routine to check that each [formula]-endomorphism ρ:L()  →  L() induces a [formula]-endomorphism [formula], where ρτ(zτ) = (ρ(z))τ. Therefore

[formula]

This together with  ([\ref=dimless]) shows [formula] and hence [formula] has the same type as [formula]-module L().

(2). If [formula], then [formula] and hence   ~  . Conversely, by Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaP], there exists [formula] such that   =  σ  ·  . By Remark [\ref=rem:Ltau], we have [formula] and hence there exists a linear map φ:L()  →  L() such that the map L()  →  L()σ, ~ u  ↦  (φ(u))σ is a [formula]-isomorphism. For each [formula], set

[formula]

It is routine to check that

[formula]

is a nonzero [formula]-homomorphism. This means [formula] since both of them are irreducible.

(3). Suppose [formula] is irreducible completely splittable with [formula] for some [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.], there exists a [formula]-isomorphism [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:newbij.], for each [formula], there exists a bijection [formula]. Now for [formula], define

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:newbij.], the bijection τ satisfies τxk = xτ(k)τ,τck = cτ(k)τ for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Hence for [formula] and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n,

[formula]

Similarly one can show that ψτ(ckzτ) = ckψτ(zτ). Therefore ψτ is a [formula]-homomorphism. By Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2] we have [formula] and hence [formula]. By the fact that ψτ is a [formula]-module homomorphism for each [formula], one can easily check that

[formula]

is a [formula]-module isomorphism.

Observe that Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] confirms a slightly modified version of [\cite=Le]. Leclerc defined a completely splittable representation to be one on which the x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n act semisimply.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2] we have [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] we obtain the following.

We have [formula]

A diagrammatic classification

In this section, we shall give a reinterpretation of irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules in terms of Young diagrams.

Let [formula] be a partition of the integer [formula], where [formula]. Denote by l(λ) the number of nonzero parts in λ. It is known that the partition λ can be drawn as Young diagrams.

A strict partition λ (i.e. with distinct parts) can be identified with the shifted Young diagram which is obtained from the ordinary Young diagram by shifting the kth row to the right by k - 1 squares, for all k  >  1. For example, let λ = (4,2,1), the corresponding shifted Young diagram is

[formula]

From now on, we shall always identify strict partitions with their shifted Young diagrams. If λ and μ are strict partitions such that μk  ≤  λk for all k, we write μ  ⊆  λ. A skew shifted Young diagram λ  /  μ is defined to be the diagram obtained by removing the shifted Young diagram μ from λ for some strict partitions μ  ⊆  λ (see examples below). Note that any skew shifted Young diagram is a union of connected components. Moreover, different pairs of strict partitions may give an identical skew shifted Young diagram.

A placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ) consists of a skew shifted Young diagram λ  /  μ and a content function [formula] which is increasing from southwest to northeast in each connected component of λ  /  μ and satisfies the following:

c(A) = c(B), A B ,

c(A) = c(B) + 1, AB ,

c(A) = 0, A λ  /  μ [formula] A.

A standard tableau of the shape λ  /  μ is a labeling of the skew shifted Young diagram λ  /  μ with the numbers [formula] such that the numbers strictly increase from left to right along each row and down each column. If T is a tableau of the shape λ  /  μ, denote by T(k) the box of λ  /  μ labeled by k in T for 1  ≤  k  ≤  |λ| - |μ|.

Let λ = (9,8,5,2,1) and μ = (7,5,4). The skew shifted Young diagram λ  /  μ is as follows:

[formula]

A standard tableau T of shape λ  /  μ:

[formula]

A placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ):

[formula]

satisfying [formula].

For each shifted Young diagram λ, there exists one and only one content function cλ defined by setting the contents of boxes on the first diagonal to be 0. Moreover, each placed skew shifted Young diagram can be obtained by removing a shifted Young diagram μ associated with cμ from the shifted Young diagram λ associated with cλ for some strict partitions μ  ⊆  λ.

If we modify the definition of placed skew shifted Young diagram by allowing non-integer contents and by adding that the difference between contents of two boxes is an integer if and only if they belong to the same connected component, then placed skew shifted Young diagrams may be used for the study of "non-integral" [formula]-modules.

For each [formula], denote by (n) the set of placed skew shifted Young diagrams with n boxes and set

[formula]

For each ((c,λ  /  μ),T)∈Δ(n), define

[formula]

A vector [formula] is said to be splittable if it satisfies that if ik = il = u for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n then u = 0 implies [formula] and u  ≥  1 implies [formula]. Denote by [formula] the subset of [formula] consisting of splittable vectors.

The map F in ([\ref=mathcalF]) sends Δ(n) to [formula].

Suppose ((c,λ  /  μ),T)∈Δ(n), we need to show that [formula] is splittable. Suppose c(T(k)) = c(T(l)) = u for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n. Without loss of generality, we can assume that [formula]. This means that there is a configuration in T of the form

[formula]

Since (c,λ  /  μ) is a placed skew shifted Young diagram and T is standard, there exists a box labeled by j located in T as in the configuration

[formula]

for some k < j < l and moreover c(T(j)) = u + 1. If u = 0, then there is no box below the box labeled by k and c(T(j)) = 1. This implies [formula]. If u  ≥  1, then there is a box labeled by t below the box labeled by k and c(T(t)) = u - 1, that is, T contains the following configuration

[formula]

for some k < s  ≠  t < l. This implies that [formula]. Hence [formula].

Given [formula], by induction on n we can produce a pair G() = ((c,λ  /  μ),T)∈Δ(n) satisfying c(T(k)) = ik for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n . If n = 1, let G() be a box labeled by 1 with content i1. Assume inductively that [formula] is already defined, where [formula]. Set u = in.

Case 1:(c',λ' / μ') contains neither a box with content u - 1 nor a box with content u + 1. Adding a new component consisting of one box labeled by n with content u to T', we obtain a new placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ) and a standard tableau T of shape λ  /  μ. Set G() = ((c,λ  /  μ),T).

Case 2: (c',λ' / μ') contains boxes with content u - 1 but no box with content u + 1. This implies [formula]. Since [formula] is splittable, u does not appear in ' and hence u - 1 appears only once in ' by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2]. Therefore there is no box of content u and only one box denoted by A with content u - 1 in ((c',λ' / μ'),T'). So we can add a new box labeled by n with content u to the right of A to obtain a new tableau T of shape (c,λ  /  μ). Set G() = ((c,λ  /  μ),T) . Observe that there is no box above A in the column containing A since there is no box of content u in ((c',λ' / μ'),T'). Hence G()∈Δ(n).

Case 3: (c',λ' / μ') contains boxes with content u + 1 but no box with content u - 1. This implies [formula]. Since [formula] is splittable, u does not appear in ' and hence u + 1 appears only once in ' by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2]. Therefore ((c',λ' / μ'),T') contains only one box denoted by B with content u + 1 and no box with content u. This means there is no box below B in ((c',λ' / μ'),T'). Adding a new box labeled by n with content u below B, we obtain a new tableau T of shape (c,λ  /  μ). Set G() = ((c,λ  /  μ),T). Clearly G()∈Δ(n).

Case 4: (c',λ' / μ') contains boxes with contents u - 1 and u + 1. Let C and D be the last boxes on the diagonals with content u - 1 and u + 1, respectively. Suppose C is labeled by s and D is labeled by t. Then is = u - 1,it = u + 1 and moreover [formula]. Since in = u, by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] we see that [formula] and [formula]. This implies that there is no box below C and no box to the right of D in ((c',λ' / μ'),T'). Moreover C and D must be of the following shape

[formula]

Add a new box labeled by n to the right of D and below C to obtain a new tableau T of shape (c,λ  /  μ). Set G() = ((c,λ  /  μ),T). It is clear that G()∈Δ(n).

Therefore we obtain a map

[formula]

satisfying [formula] if G() = ((c,λ  /  μ),T). In this case, we will say that G() affords the placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ).

Suppose n = 5. The map G maps the splittable vector [formula] to the pair ((c,λ  /  μ),T)∈Δ(5) with

[formula]

The map G in ([\ref=mathcalG]) is a bijection from [formula] to Δ(n) with inverse F.

It is clear that [formula] for any [formula] by ([\ref=mathcalG]). It remains to prove that [formula] for any ((c,λ),T)∈Δ(n). We shall proceed by induction on n. Denote by A the box labeled by n in T. Removing A from (c,λ  /  μ) and T, we obtain a new pair ((c',λ' / μ'),T')∈Δ(n - 1). By induction we see that

[formula]

This means [formula]. By adding a box denoted by B labeled by n with content c(T(n)) to ((c',λ' / μ'),T') by the procedure for defining G, we obtain [formula]. One can check case by case that B coincides with A and hence [formula]. This means [formula].

Suppose [formula]. Then   ~   if and only if G() and G() afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram.

Suppose that G() and G() afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ). This means that there exist standard tableaux T and S of shape λ  /  μ such that [formula] and [formula]. We shall prove   ~   by induction on n. Let T0 be the tableau of shape λ  /  μ obtained by filling in the numbers [formula] from left to right along the rows, starting from the first row and going down. Clearly T0 is standard and hence we have [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:plYcont]. Let A be the last box of the last row of λ  /  μ. Then in T0, A is occupied by n. Suppose in T, A is occupied by the number k. Clearly k + 1 and k do not lie on adjacent diagonals in T, hence the transposition sk is admissible with respect to [formula]. So we can apply sk to swap k and k + 1, then to swap k + 1 and k + 2, and finally we obtain a new standard tableau T1 in which A is occupied by n and moreover [formula]. Observe that A is occupied by n in both T1 and T0. Hence both [formula] and [formula] contains the placed skew shifted Young diagram obtained by removing A from (c,λ  /  μ). By induction we have [formula] is equivalent to [formula] and then [formula]. Therefore we obtain [formula]. Similarly, we can apply the above argument to P to obtain [formula]. Hence   ~  .

Conversely, it suffices to check the case when  = sk  ·  , where sk is admissible with respect to [formula] for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. This is reduced to show that [formula] and [formula] afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram. Suppose [formula] affords the placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ). Since sk is admissible with respect to [formula], we have [formula] and hence the resulting placed skew shifted Young diagram obtained by adding two boxes with contents ik,ik + 1 in two different orders to (c,λ  /  μ) via the procedure for defining G are identical.

A diagrammatic classification for p = 0

In this subsection, we assume that p = 0. By Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2], [formula] consists of all splittable vectors in [formula] and hence [formula]. Recall the definition of [formula]-module [formula] from Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] for [formula]. Suppose (c,λ  /  μ)∈(n), by Proposition [\ref=onto] there exists [formula] such that G() affords (c,λ  /  μ). Let

[formula]

Note that if [formula] satisfies that G() also affords (c,λ  /  μ), then   ~   by Lemma [\ref=lem:pocomb.des2] and hence the [formula]-module D(c,λ  /  μ) is unique (up to isomorphism) by Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation](2).

For (c,λ  /  μ)∈(n), denote γ0(c,λ  /  μ) by the number of boxes with content zero in (c,λ  /  μ) and let fλ  /  μ be the number of standard tableaux of shape λ  /  μ.

The following is a Young diagrammatic reformulation of Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] for p = 0. Note that it confirms

Suppose that (c,λ  /  μ)∈(n) and write γ0  =  γ0(c,λ  /  μ).

(1) D(c,λ  /  μ) is type [formula] if γ0 is even and is type [formula] if γ0 is odd. Moreover, [formula].

(2) The [formula]-modules D(c,λ  /  μ) for (c,λ  /  μ)∈(n) form a complete set of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules in [formula].

(1) Suppose (c,λ  /  μ)∈(n) and G() affords (c,λ  /  μ) for some [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=onto], we have [formula] and hence the number of 1  ≤  k  ≤  n with ik = 0 is equal to γ0. This together with Lemma [\ref=lem:irrepPn] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation](1) shows that [formula] is type [formula] if γ0 is even and is type [formula] if γ0 is odd. Denote by [formula] the number of elements contained in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:pocomb.des2], there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of weights in [formula] equivalent to [formula] and the set of standard tableaux of shape λ  /  μ. Hence [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaP]. This together with Lemma [\ref=lem:irrepPn] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] shows that

[formula]

(2) It follows from Proposition [\ref=onto], Lemma [\ref=lem:pocomb.des2] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation].

A diagrammatic classification for p  ≥  3

In this subsection, we assume p  ≥  3. Set

[formula]

Observe that [formula] is the disjoint union of [formula] and [formula]. Moreover if [formula] and   ~  , then [formula] for k = 1,2. For each [formula] and m  ≥  1, let u(m) be the set of placed skew shifted Young diagrams (c,λ  /  μ) with m boxes such that the contents of boxes of λ  /  μ are smaller than or equal to u. For [formula], set

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2], we see that [formula].

The restriction of the map G in ([\ref=mathcalG]) to [formula] gives a bijection [formula]. Moreover, [formula] if and only if G1() and G1() afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram.

Observe that [formula] can be identified with the subset of [formula] consisting of splittable vectors whose parts are less than or equal to [formula]. Hence by Proposition [\ref=onto], the restriction G1 of the map G establishes a bijection between [formula] and Δ1(n). Now the rest of the Proposition follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:pocomb.des2].

For each [formula], denote by [formula] the minimal integer such that there exist 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n satisfying [formula] and [formula]. By the definition of [formula], we see that [formula] always exists.

Let [formula] and write [formula].

There exists a unique sequence of integers [formula] such that

[formula] for [formula],

ia  ≠  u - 1 for all r0  ≤  a  ≤  t0,

ib  ≤  u - 1 for all [formula].

[formula] for some [formula] whose parts are less than u and some 0  ≤  m  ≤  u.

(1) By Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2], there exists a sequence of integers [formula] such that [formula], and u + j does not appear between irj and itj in [formula] for each [formula]. Hence it suffices to prove (1)(c). Assume that ib = u + k for some [formula] and some [formula]. Since u + k does not appear between irk and itk, we see that either b < rk or b > tk. Now assume b < rk. Since ib = u + k = irk, by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] there exists b1 with b < b1 < rk and ib1 = u + k + 1. Again since ib1 = u + k + 1 = irk + 1, using Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] there exists b2 with b1 < b2 < rk + 1 such that ib2 = u + k + 2. Continuing in this way, we finally obtain an integer f satisfying [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2], [formula] appears between if and [formula]. So [formula] appears at least twice in [formula] since [formula] and [formula]. This contradicts Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2]. An identical argument holds for the case when b > tk. Therefore ib  ≤  u - 1 for all [formula].

(2) As shown in (1), there exists a sequence of integers [formula] such that [formula] for [formula]. If u - 1 does not appear after it0 in [formula], then ia  ≤  u - 2 for all [formula] by (1)(c). By applying admissible transpositions we can swap ik with il in [formula] for all [formula] and [formula]. Finally we obtain an element of the form [formula].

Now assume u - 1 appears after it0 in [formula]. Since ib  ≠  u for all b > t0 by (1)(c), we see that u - 1 appears at most once after it0 in [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2]. Therefore there exists a unique l1 > t0 such that il1 = u - 1. If u - 2 does not appear after il1, then ia  ≤  u - 3 for all [formula] by (1)(c). Hence we can apply admissible transpositions to [formula] to obtain an element of the form [formula].

Now assume u - 2 appears after il1. Since u - 1 appears only once with il1 = u - 1 after it0 in [formula], we see that ib  ≠  u - 1 for all b > l1 and hence u - 2 appears at most once after il1 in [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2]. This means there exists a unique l2 > l1 such that il2 = u - 2. By repeating the above process, we arrive at the claim in (2).

By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom1], for [formula], there exists a unique vector [formula] as follows

[formula]

which is obtained by removing [formula] from [formula].

The following holds for [formula].

[formula] has a unique part equal to [formula] and all other parts are less than [formula].

[formula] is splittable.

~   if   ~  .

(1). It follows from the definition of [formula].

(2). Suppose [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom1], there exists a unique sequence of integers [formula] such that [formula] for [formula] and ia  ≠  u - 1,ib  ≤  u - 1 for all r0  ≤  a  ≤  t0 and [formula]. Assume ik = il = v for some [formula]. To show [formula] is splittable, we need to show that if v = 0 then 1 appears between ik and il in [formula] and if 1  ≤  v  ≤  u - 1 then v - 1 and v + 1 appear between ik and il in [formula]. One can easily check the case when v = 0. Now assume [formula]. If 1  ≤  v < u - 1, by the choice of u there exist k < s,t < l such that is = v - 1,it = v + 1. Observe that v - 1 < u - 2,v + 1  ≤  u - 1. Hence [formula]. This means v - 1 and v + 1 appear between ik and il in [formula]. Now assume v = u - 1. Since there are no parts equal to u before ir0 and after it0 in [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] that u - 1 appears at most once before ir0 and after it0 in [formula], respectively. This together with the fact that ia  ≠  u - 1 for r0 < a < t0 shows a < r0 and b > t0 . By the choice of u, there exists a < c < b such that ic = u - 2. This together with ir0 = u shows that v - 1 = u - 2 and v + 1 = u appear between ik and il in [formula].

(2). It suffices to check the case when [formula], where sk is admissible with respect to [formula]. If [formula], then  = sk  ·   and hence   ~  . Otherwise we see that   =  .

Suppose [formula] and (c,λ  /  μ)∈u(m) for some [formula]. Observe that there exists at most one box with content u in (c,λ  /  μ). Let us denote by *u(m)  ⊆  u(m) the subset consisting of placed skew shifted Young diagrams which contain a unique box of content u. Suppose (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(m) and let A(c,λ  /  μ) be the unique box of content u. Add p - 2u - 1 boxes to the right of A(c,λ  /  μ) in the row containing A(c,λ  /  μ) to obtain a skew shifted Young diagram denoted by [formula]. A standard tableau of shape [formula] is said to be p-standard if it satisfies that if there exists a box below A(c,λ  /  μ) then it is labeled by a number greater than the one in the last box in the row containing A(c,λ  /  μ). For [formula], set

[formula]

Suppose [formula] and set [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom1], there exists a unique sequence of integers [formula] such that [formula] for [formula]. Since the vector [formula] in ([\ref=ihat]) is splittable, by Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom2](2) we apply the map G in ([\ref=mathcalG]) to [formula] to get a placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ) and a standard tableau T of shape λ  /  μ whose boxes are labeled by [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom2](1), we have (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1). Label the boxes in [formula] on the right of A(c,λ  /  μ) by [formula] consecutively and denote the resulting tableau by S. Observe that A(c,λ  /  μ) is labeled by r0 and hence the row containing A(c,λ  /  μ) in S is increasing. If there exists a box denoted by B below A(c,λ  /  μ), then B has content u - 1. Suppose B is labeled by e, then ie = u - 1 and e > r0. Hence e > t0 since ik  ≠  u - 1 for r0  ≤  k  ≤  t0. Therefore S is p-standard. Set G2(): = ((c,λ  /  μ),S). Hence we obtain a map

[formula]

If G2() = ((c,λ  /  μ),S), we say G2() affords the placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ).

Suppose p = 7 and n = 7. Note that the vector  = (1,2,0,3,2,1,0) belongs to [formula] with [formula] and  = (1,2,0,1,0). By Example [\ref=example1], we see that the map G2 sends [formula] to the pair ((c,λ  /  μ),S) with

[formula]

On the other hand, suppose (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) for [formula] and S is p-standard tableau of shape [formula]. Assume that the boxes on the right of A(c,λ  /  μ) in S are labeled by [formula]. Define the contents of these additional boxes by setting [formula] and c(S(rj)) = u + j = c(S(tj)) for [formula]. Set

[formula]

The map F2 in ([\ref=mathcalFover]) sends Δ2(n) to [formula].

Suppose ((c,λ  /  μ),S)∈Δ2(n) so that (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) for [formula]. Assume that c(S(k)) = c(S(l)) = v for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n.

If 0  ≤  v  ≤  u - 1, both boxes S(k) and S(l) belong to (c,λ  /  μ). Hence [formula] if v = 0, and [formula] if 1  ≤  v  ≤  u - 1. Now v = u + m for some [formula]. Suppose the box A(c,λ  /  μ) is labeled by r0 and the boxes on its right in S are labeled by [formula]. By the definition of F2, the boxes S(k) and S(l) coincide with S(rm) and S(tm), respectively. Therefore [formula] contains the subsequence [formula], and [formula].

The map [formula] is a bijection with inverse F2.

It is clear that [formula] for [formula]. Conversely, suppose (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) and S is a p-standard tableau of shape [formula] for some [formula]. Set [formula]. Denote by T the standard tableau of shape λ  /  μ obtained by removing the p - 2u - 1 boxes on the right of A(c,λ  /  μ) from S. Suppose the boxes of T are labeled by [formula]. By the definition of F2 we have

[formula]

Therefore [formula] by Proposition [\ref=onto]. Note that G2() is obtained by adding p - 2u - 1 boxes labeled by [formula] to the right of A(c,λ  /  μ) in T. Since T is obtained by removing the p - 2u - 1 boxes on the right of A(c,λ  /  μ) from S, G2() = ((c,λ  /  μ),S) and hence [formula].

[formula] if and only if G2() and G2() afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram in *u(n - p + 2u + 1) for some [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom2], if   ~  , then   ~  . By Lemma [\ref=lem:pocomb.des2], G() and G() afford the same skew shifted Young diagram. Hence G2() and G2() afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) for some [formula].

Conversely, suppose G2() and G2() afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) for some [formula]. Suppose there are m boxes below A(c,λ  /  μ) in (c,λ  /  μ). By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom1], we see that

[formula]

for some [formula]. This together with Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom2] shows that

[formula]

Observe that G() and G() afford the placed skew shifted Young diagram (c,λ  /  μ). Therefore G(') and G(') afford the same placed skew shifted Young diagram and hence '  ~  ' by Lemma [\ref=lem:pocomb.des2]. This together with ([\ref=isim']) and ([\ref=jsim']) shows that   ~  .

Suppose [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb0] and Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb2], there exists [formula] such that Gk() affords (c,λ  /  μ) for k = 1,2. Let

[formula]

Note that if there exists [formula] satisfying that Gk() also affords (c,λ  /  μ) for k = 1,2, then   ~   by Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb0] and Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom3] and hence the [formula]-module Dp(c,λ  /  μ) is unique (up to isomorphism) by Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation](2).

For [formula], denote by γ0(c,λ  /  μ) the number of boxes with content zero in (c,λ  /  μ). If [formula], set fλ  /  μ to be the number of standard tableaux of shape λ  /  μ. If [formula], let fλ  /  μp be the number of p-standard tableaux of shape [formula].

The following is a Young diagrammatic reformulation of Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] for p  ≥  3.

Suppose [formula] and write γ0  =  γ0(c,λ  /  μ). Then,

Dp(c,λ  /  μ) is type [formula] if γ0 is even and is type [formula] if γ0 is odd. Moreover if [formula], then [formula]; if [formula], then [formula].

(2) The [formula]-modules Dp(c,λ  /  μ) for [formula] form a set of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible completely splittable [formula]-modules in [formula].

(1) By Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb0] and Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb2], the number of 1  ≤  k  ≤  n with ik = 0 equals to γ0. Hence by Lemma [\ref=lem:irrepPn] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation], Dp(c,λ  /  μ) is type [formula] if γ0 is even and is type [formula] if γ0 is odd.

Set [formula] to be the number of elements contained in [formula]. If [formula], then by Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb0] there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of weights in [formula] equivalent to [formula] and the set of standard tableaux of shape λ  /  μ. This implies [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaP]. If (c,λ  /  μ)∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) for some [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom3], there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of weights in [formula] equivalent to [formula] and the set of splittable standard tableaux of shape [formula]. This implies [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaP]. Now the Proposition follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:irrepPn] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation].

(2) It follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb0], Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb2], Lemma [\ref=lem:ppcom3] and Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation](3).

Note that for fixed p  ≥  3, [formula] if and only if [formula]. Moreover if [formula], then [formula] for [formula]. Hence there is no irreducible completely splittable supermodule in [formula] if [formula] for fixed p  ≥  3.

Completely splittable representations of finite Hecke-Clifford algebras

Denote by Cn the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula], which is known as the Clifford algebra. The finite Hecke-Clifford algebra [formula] is isomorphic to the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula]. The Jucys-Murphy elements Lk(1  ≤  k  ≤  n) in Yn are defined as

[formula]

where (jk) is the transposition exchanging j and k and keeping all others fixed.

A Yn-module is called completely splittable if the Jucys-Murphy elements Lk(1  ≤  k  ≤  n) act semisimply.

It is well known that there exists a surjective homomorphism

[formula]

whose kernel coincides with the ideal of [formula] generated by x1. Hence the category of finite dimensional Yn-modules can be identified as the category of finite dimensional [formula]-modules which are annihilated by x1. By [\cite=BK] (cf. [\cite=K2]), a [formula]-module M belongs to the category [formula] if all of eigenvalues of xj on M are of the form q(i) for some 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Hence the category of finite dimensional completely splittable Yn-module can be identified with the subcategory of [formula] consisting of completely splittable [formula]-modules on which x1 = 0. By ([\ref=decomp.1]), we can decompose any finite dimensional Yn-module M as

[formula]

where [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] is called a weight of M.

Define W(Yn) to be the set of weights [formula] satisfying the following additional conditions:

[formula]

W(Yn) is the set of weights occurring in irreducible completely splittable Yn-modules.

Suppose [formula] occurs in some irreducible completely splittable representation M of Yn, then i1 = 0 since L1 = 0 on M. For 2  ≤  k  ≤  n, if ik = 0, then by Lemma [\ref=lem:restr.2] we have [formula] and hence [formula]. Now assume ik  ≥  1 and suppose [formula]. Then sl is admissible with respect to [formula] for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k - 1 and hence [formula]. Set [formula]. Note j1 = ik  ≠  0 and this contradicts the fact that L1 = 0 on M.

Conversely, let ∈W(Yn). Recall [formula] and [formula] from ([\ref=Punderi]) and ([\ref=Dunderi]), respectively. It can be easily checked that τ  ·  ∈W(Yn) for each [formula] and hence x1 = 0 on [formula]. This implies that [formula] can be factored through the surjective map [formula] and hence it gives an irreducible completely splittable Yn-module. The Proposition follows from the fact that [formula] is a weight of [formula].

Denote by [formula] the subset of [formula] consisting of [formula] satisfying ([\ref=weigofSerg]).

The restriction [formula] of the map G in ([\ref=mathcalG]) induces a bijection between [formula] and the set of pairs (λ,T) of strict partitions λ and standard tableaux T of shape λ.

Let us proceed by induction on n. Clearly the statement holds for n = 1. Let [formula]. Then [formula] and by induction we have [formula] for some shifted Young diagram [formula] with n - 1 boxes and a standard tableau S of shape [formula]. Note that G() is obtained by adding a box labeled by n to the diagonal of content in in S. Since [formula], the resulting diagram is still a shifted Young diagram.

Note that if p = 0, then W(Yn) coincides with [formula]. Hence by Theorem [\ref=thm:dimandparam.] we have the following which recovers Nazarov's result in [\cite=Na1].

Suppose that p = 0 and that λ is a strict partition of n. Then,

(1) There exists an irreducible Yn-module D(λ) satisfying that [formula], where fλ is the number of standard λ-tableaux. Moreover, D(λ) is type [formula] if l(λ) is even and is type [formula] if l(λ) is odd.

(2) The set of shifted Young diagrams with n boxes parameterizes the irreducible completely splittable Yn-modules.

Suppose λ is a strict partition of n. Recall the content function cλ from Remark [\ref=rem:shiftedY]. Note that (cλ,λ)∈(n). Recall the [formula]-module D(cλ,λ) from ([\ref=D(c] [\ref=lambda)]) and let

[formula]

Now the Proposition follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:dimandparam.].

In the remaining part of this section, let us assume that [formula]. Set [formula] for k = 1,2.

The restriction [formula] of G1 to W1(Yn) gives a bijection from W1(Yn) to the set of pairs (λ,T) of strict partitions λ of n boxes whose first part is less than or equal to [formula] and standard tableaux T of shape λ.

Observe that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:shiftedY] and Proposition [\ref=prop:ppcomb0], there exists a one-to-one correspondence between [formula] and the set consisting of pairs of shifted Young diagrams [formula] and standard tableaux of shape λ with c(T(k)) = ik for each 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Suppose the last box in the first row of T is labeled by l, then c(T(l)) = λ1 - 1 and hence [formula] since [formula].

The restriction [formula] of the map G2 to W2(Yn) gives a bijection from [formula] to the set consisting of pairs (λ,T), where λ is a strict partition whose first part is equal to p - u and second part is less than or equal to u for some [formula], and T is a standard tableau of shape λ satisfying that if λ2 = u then the number in last box of the second row is greater than the number in the last box of the first row in T.

Suppose ∈W2(Yn). It is clear that [formula] for some [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:shiftedY], we have [formula] for some shifted Young diagram μ∈*u(n - p + 2u + 1) and splittable standard tableau S of shape μ. Suppose [formula] and set [formula]. Observe that the last box in the first row of μ has content u. This implies μ1 - 1 = u and hence μ1 = u + 1,μ2  ≤  u. Therefore λ1  =  μ1 + p - 2u - 1 = p - u and λ2  =  μ2  ≤  u. Note that if λ2 < u, then the set of splittable standard tableaux of shape λ coincides with the set of standard λ-tableaux; otherwise the set of splittable standard tableaux of shape λ coincides with the set of standard λ-tableaux in which the number in last box in the second row is greater than the number in the last box in the first row.

If [formula] is strict partition of n satisfying [formula], then [formula], where cλ is the unique content function on λ by Remark [\ref=rem:shiftedY]. Recall the [formula]-module Dp(cλ,λ) from ([\ref=D(c] [\ref=lambda)p]) and let

[formula]

Let fλ be the number of standard tableaux of shape λ. Recall [formula] and γ0(cλ,λ) from Theorem [\ref=thm:dimpandparam.]. Clearly [formula] and moreover γ0(cλ,λ) = l(λ).

If [formula] is strict partition of n satisfying λ1 = p - u and λ2  ≤  u for some [formula]. Denote by λ̂ the strict partition obtained by removing the last p - 2u - 1 boxes in the first row of λ. Recall cλ̂ from Remark [\ref=rem:shiftedY]. Note that [formula]. Recall the [formula]-module Dp(cλ̂,λ̂) from ([\ref=D(c] [\ref=lambda)p]) and let

[formula]

Let fλp be the number of standard λ-tableau T if λ1 = p - u,λ2  <  u for some [formula]; if λ1 = p - u,λ2 = u for some [formula] let fλp be the number of standard λ-tableau T in which the number in last box of the second row is greater than the number in the last box of the first row. Recall [formula] and γ0(cλ̂,λ̂) from Theorem [\ref=thm:dimpandparam.]. One can easily check that [formula] and moreover γ0(cλ̂,λ̂) = l(λ).

Combining the above observations and Lemma [\ref=Sergpp1], Lemma [\ref=Sergpp2] and Theorem [\ref=thm:dimpandparam.], we have the following.

Let p  ≥  3. Suppose that [formula] is strict partition with n boxes satisfying either (λ1 = p - u and λ2  ≤  u for some [formula] or [formula].

(1) Dp(λ) is type [formula] if l(λ) is even and is type [formula] if l(λ) is odd. If [formula], then [formula]; if λ1 = p - u and λ2  ≤  u, then [formula].

(2) The Yn-modules Dp(λ) for strict partitions [formula] with n boxes satisfying either (λ1 = p - u,λ2  ≤  u for some [formula] or [formula] form a complete set of non-isomorphic irreducible completely splittable Yn-modules.

(1) A partition [formula] is called p-restricted p-strict if p divides λr whenever λr  =  λr + 1 for r  ≥  1 and in addition λr  -  λr + 1 < p if p|λr and λr  -  λr + 1  ≤  p if [formula] (cf. [\cite=BK]). It is known from [\cite=BK] that there exists an irreducible Yn-module M(λ) associated to each p-restricted p-strict partition λ of n and moreover [formula] forms a complete set of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible Yn-modules. If λ is a strict partition with either λ1 = p - u and λ2  ≤  u for some [formula] or [formula], then λ is p-restricted p-strict and moreover [formula] by claiming that they have the same set of weights.

(2) It is well known that the representation theory of the spin symmetric group algebra [formula] is essentially equivalent to that of Yn due to the isomorphism [formula]. Applying the representation theory of Yn established so far, we can obtain a family of irreducible representations of the spin symmetric group algebra [formula] for which dimensions and characters can be explicitly described. Over the complex field [formula], these modules were originally constructed by Nazarov in [\cite=Na1].

A larger category

Recall that Cn is the Clifford algebra generated by [formula] subject to the relation ([\ref=clifford]) and [formula]. The basic spin Yn-module I(n) (cf. [\cite=BK]) is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the trivial 1-dimensional [formula]-module. Note that [formula] forms a basis of I(n). It can be easily checked that each element [formula] is a simultaneous eigenvector for [formula]. Hence all L2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply on I(n). Define the p-restricted p-strict partition ωn by

[formula]

where n = ap + b with 0  ≤  b < p. By [\cite=BK], we have [formula] if [formula] and if p|n then I(n) is an indecomposable module with two composition factors both isomorphic to M(ωn). By Remark [\ref=rem:Serg], the Jucys-Murphy elements Lk do not act semisimply on M(ωn). Hence L2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply on M(ωn) which is not completely splittable. On the other hand, Wang [\cite=W] introduced the degenerate spin affine Hecke-Clifford algebra [formula], which is the superalgebra with odd generators bi(1  ≤  i  ≤  n) and ti(1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1) subject to the relations

[formula]

Moreover, an algebra isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] which maps xk to [formula] is established. Since [formula] are anti-commutative, it is reasonable to study [formula]-modules on which the commuting operators [formula] act semisimply. As x2k is sent to 2b2k, it is reduced to study the [formula]-modules on which x2k act semisimply.

Motivated by the above observations, in this section we shall study the category of [formula]-modules on which all x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply.

The case for n = 2,3.

Recall the irreducible [formula]-module V(i,j) for [formula] from Proposition [\ref=prop:rank_2].

Let [formula]. Then x21,x22 act semisimply on the [formula]-module V(i,j) if and only if i  ≠  j or i = j = 0.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:rank_2], if i  ≠  j then V(i,j) is completely splittable and hence x21,x22 act semisimply. It suffices to prove that if i = j, then x21,x22 act semisimply on V(i,j) if and only if i = j = 0. Now assume i = j. By Proposition [\ref=prop:rank_2], [formula]. Suppose x21,x22 act semisimply on V(i,j) and let 0  ≠  z∈V(i,j). Then x21z = q(i)z = x22z. This together with ([\ref=reln:x2s1]) shows that

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

This means q(i) = 0 and hence i = 0 since p  ≠  2.

Conversely if i = j = 0, then x1 = 0 = x2 on [formula] and hence x21 = 0 = x22 on V(i,j) by the fact that V(0,0) has two composition factors isomorphic to [formula] as [formula]-modules.

Observe that the subalgebra generated by xk,xk + 1,ck,ck + 1,sk is isomorphic to [formula] for each fixed 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, . By Lemma [\ref=lem:n=2], we have the following.

Suppose that [formula] and x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n act semisimply. Let [formula] be a weight of M. If ik = ik + 1 for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, then ik = ik + 1 = 0.

For any z∈V(0,0), we have

[formula]

Let z∈V(0,0). By Lemma [\ref=lem:n=2], x21 = 0 = x22 on V(0,0). This together with ([\ref=reln:x2s1]) shows that

[formula]

Multiplying both sides of ([\ref=xccx]) by x1(1 + c1c2), we obtain that

[formula]

This implies that x1x2z = 0 since x21z = 0.

Recall that [formula] is the subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] and S2.

The irreducible [formula]-module [formula] affords an irreducible [formula]-module via s2  =  Ξ2.

Since L(1) is of type [formula], by Lemma [\ref=tensorsmod] [formula]. It is routine to check that s22 = 1,s2x1 = x1s2,s2x2 = x3s2 - (1 + c2c3) and s2c1 = c1s2,s2c2 = c3s2 on V(0,0,1). It remains to prove s1s2s1 = s2s1s2. Let 0  ≠  z∈V(0,0,1). Note that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Using ([\ref=n3s2z]) with z replaced by s1z and ([\ref=px1]), we show by a straightforward calculation that

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

On the other hand, it follows from ([\ref=n3s2z]) with z replaced by s2z and ([\ref=n3s1s2]) that

[formula]

The first term on the right hand side of ([\ref=s2s1s2]) can be simplified as follows

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=s1s2s1]) and ([\ref=s2s1s2]) shows that

[formula]

which is zero by Lemma [\ref=lem:NP].

An identical argument used for proving Lemma [\ref=lem:n=3case1] shows that [formula]-module [formula] affords an irreducible [formula]-module via s1  =  Ξ1.

Each irreducible [formula]-module in [formula] on which x21,x22,x23 act semisimply is isomorphic to one of the following.

A completely splittable [formula]-module [formula] for [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation]).

V(0,0,1).

V(1,0,0).

[formula] with j  ≠  0,1.

We first show that listed pairwise non-isomorphic modules are irreducible and all x2k act semisimply. The case (1), (2) and (3) are taken care of by Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation] and Lemma [\ref=lem:n=3case1]. Using [\cite=BK], we have [formula] is irreducible if j  ≠  0,1. It is known that as vector spaces

[formula]

It is clear that for [formula],

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=px2]) implies x21 = 0 on [formula]. Using ([\ref=reln:x2s1]) and ([\ref=reln:x2s2]), we obtain that

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=xsq-1]) shows that for any [formula],

[formula]

Similarly using ([\ref=reln:x2s1]), ([\ref=reln:x2s2]) and ([\ref=xsq-1]) we see that

[formula]

Therefore it follows from ([\ref=xsq-1]) and ([\ref=xsq-2]) that for any [formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=reln:x2s1]) and ([\ref=xsq-1]), we obtain that for any [formula],

[formula]

This together with ([\ref=reln:x2s1]) and x23 = q(j) on [formula] shows that for [formula]

[formula]

Therefore for any [formula],

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=xsq-1]), ([\ref=xsq-2]), ([\ref=xsq-3]) and ([\ref=xsq-4]), we see that the actions of x1,x2,x3 on the [formula]-module [formula] satisfy

[formula]

It follows that x21,x22,x23 act semisimply on [formula].

Now assume [formula] is irreducible, on which all x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n act semisimply. Let us assume M is not completely splittable, then by Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.] M has a weight of the form (i,i,j) or (j,i,i) for some [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=cor:n=2] we obtain that i = 0. Hence by Frobenius reciprocity M is a quotient of [formula] or [formula].

If j = 0, then M is isomorphic to the Kato module [formula]. By [\cite=BK], all Jordan blocks of x1 on M are of size 3. This means x41 = 0 on M but not x21. Hence x21 does not act semisimply on M.

If j = 1, then the weights of M belong to S3  ·  (0,0,1). By [\cite=BK], there are at most three non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-modules whose weights belong to the set S3  ·  (0,0,1) = {(0,0,1),(0,1,0),(1,0,0)}. By Theorem [\ref=thm:Classficiation], the [formula]-module [formula] affords an irreducible completely splittable [formula]-module via s1  =  Ξ1,s2  =  Ξ2. Observe that the modules V(0,0,1),V(1,0,0) and V(0,1,0) are non-isomorphic and have weights belonging to S3  ·  (0,0,1). Since M is not completely splittable, [formula] or [formula].

If j  ≠  0,1, by [\cite=BK] we have that

[formula]

is irreducible. Hence [formula].

Observe that the subalgebra generated by xk,xk + 1,xk + 2,ck,ck + 1,ck + 2,sk,sk + 1 is isomorphic to [formula] for fixed 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2 . By Proposition [\ref=prop:n=3], we have the following.

Suppose that [formula], on which all x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n act semisimply. Let [formula] be a weight of M. Then there does not exist 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2 such that ik = ik + 1 = ik + 2.

Conjecture for general n.

Suppose that [formula] is irreducible and [formula] for some [formula]. If x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply on M, then [formula] satisfies the following.

If [formula], then sk  ·   is a weight of M.

If ik = ik + 1 for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, then ik = ik + 1 = 0.

There does not exist 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2 such that ik = ik + 1 = ik + 2.

If ik = ik + 2 for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2, then

If p = 0, then ik = ik + 2 = 0.

If p  ≥  3, then either [formula] and [formula] or (ik = ik + 2 = 0).

(1) If [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem:newoperator] k is a well-defined bijection from [formula] to Msk  ·  . Hence Msk  ·    ≠  0.

(2) It follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:n=2].

(3) It follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:n=3].

(4) Suppose ik = ik + 2 = u and ik + 1 = v for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2. Observe that for each fixed 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2, x2k,x2k + 1,x2k + 2 act semisimply on the restriction of M to the subalgebra generated by xk,xk + 1,xk + 2,ck,ck + 1,ck + 2,sk,sk + 1 which is isomorphic to [formula]. This implies that (u,v,u) appears as a weight of a [formula]-module on which x21,x22,x23 act semisimply. By Proposition [\ref=prop:n=3], if p = 0, then u = 0; if p  ≥  3, then either u = 0,v is arbitrary or [formula].

Suppose that [formula] is irreducible and [formula] for some [formula]. If all x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n act semisimply on M, then [formula] satisfies the following.

If p = 0 and u = ik = il  ≥  1 for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n, then

[formula]

If [formula] and u = ik = il  ≥  1 for some 1  ≤  k < l  ≤  n, then

[formula]

(1) Without loss of generality, we can assume [formula]. By the technique used in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2], one can show that [formula]. Now assume [formula]. Then u - 1 appears at least twice between ik + 1 and il - 1 in [formula]; otherwise we can apply admissible transpositions to [formula] to obtain a weight of M of the form [formula] which contradicts Proposition [\ref=x2semi](4). Hence there exist k < k1 < l1 < l such that

[formula]

An identical argument shows that there exist k1 < k2 < l2 < l1 such that

[formula]

Continuing in this way, we achieve the claim.

(2) By the technique used in (1), one can easily show that if [formula] then [formula] contains [formula] as a subsequence. If [formula], an identical argument used in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:restr.2](5) shows that [formula] contains [formula] as a subsequence.

Suppose that [formula] is irreducible. Then x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n, act semisimply on M if and only if each weight of M satisfies the list of properties stated in Proposition [\ref=x2semi].

The above conjecture holds for n = 2,3.

Clearly the above conjecture holds for n = 2 by Lemma [\ref=lem:n=2]. Suppose M is an irreducible [formula]-module whose weights satisfy the list of properties stated in Proposition [\ref=x2semi]. Let [formula] be a weight of M. Then by Frobenius reciprocity, M is isomorphic to a quotient of [formula]. Hence the weights of M are of the form σ  ·  (i1,i2,i3) for σ∈S3  ·  . If i1,i2,i3 are distinct, then all weights [formula] of M satisfy jk  ≠  jk + 1 for k = 1,2. By Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.], M is completely splittable and hence all x21,x22,x23 act semisimply on it.

Now assume i1,i2,i3 are not distinct. If p = 0, by the properties in Proposition [\ref=x2semi] we have that (i1,i2,i3) is of the form (0,0,j), (0,j,0) or (j,0,0) for some j  ≥  1. By Proposition [\ref=prop:n=3], all x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  3 act semisimply on M. If p  ≥  3, by the properties in Proposition [\ref=x2semi] we see that either [formula] or (i1,i2,i3) has the form (0,0,j), (0,j,0) or (j,0,0) for some j  ≥  1. In the latter case, by Proposition [\ref=prop:n=3], all x2k,1  ≤  k  ≤  3 act semisimply on M. Assume [formula]. Since M satisfies the properties in Proposition [\ref=x2semi], [formula] and [formula] are not the weights of M. Hence M has only one weight, that is, [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv.cond.], M is completely splittable and hence all x21,x22,x23 act semisimply on it.
