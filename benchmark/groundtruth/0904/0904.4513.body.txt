Introduction.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all varieties are assumed to be projective, normal, and defined over [formula].

Let X be a variety with at worst log canonical singularities and D be an effective divisor on X. The log canonical threshold cx(D) of D at a point x in X is defined by

[formula]

The log canonical threshold c(X,D) of the divisor D is defined by

[formula]

It is known that these numbers can be defined by some other equivalent ways. For instance, if the divisor D is defined by a regular function f near a smooth point x, then the log canonical threshold cx(D) of D at the point x is the number defined by

[formula]

It is also related to the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of the regular function f. The log canonical threshold c(X,D) of the divisor D can be defined by multiplier ideal sheaf as follows:

[formula]

where J(cD) is the multiplier ideal sheaf of cD.

Log canonical threshold, like multiplicity, measures how singular a divisor is. However, log canonical threshold is a subtler invariant than multiplicity. For instance, for the divisor D on [formula] defined by x2 = yn around the origin 0 that is of multiplicity 2 at the origin, the log canonical threshold c0(D) of the divisor D at the origin has different values as n varies. Also, log canonical threshold is rather difficult to calculate in a general case. However, it has many amazing properties and presents important applications to various areas such as birational geometry and Kähler geometry.

The following theorem is one of the motivations of the present paper.

Proof. See [\cite=CSh08] and [\cite=DeKo01]. [formula]

This result motivates the definition of the following numerical invariants.

Let X be a Fano variety with at worst log terminal singularities. The m-th global log canonical threshold of X is defined by the number

[formula]

The global log canonical threshold is defined by [formula]. Here, we do not define the m-th global log canonical threshold of X if the linear system | - mKX| is empty.

We can see that [formula] is the supremum of the values c such that the log pair (X,cD) is log canonical for every effective [formula]-divisor numerically equivalent to - KX. Using the global log canonical threshold, Theorem [\ref=theorem:KE] can be reinterpreted as saying that the Fano manifold X admits a Kähler-Einstein metric if

[formula]

The paper [\cite=Pu05] also shows that the global log canonical threshold plays important role in rationality problems.

The first global log canonical threshold may be a cornerstone to get [formula]. It is natural that we ask whether there is an integer m with [formula]. We can find some evidence in simple cases.

Proof. See [\cite=Ch07a] and [\cite=P99]. [formula]

Throughout the present paper, an algebraic surface S with ample anticanonical divisor will be called a del Pezzo surface of degree d if it has at worst normal Gorenstein canonical singularities and the self-intersection number of the anticanonical divisor is d. Let Σ be the set of singular points of S. For singular del Pezzo surfaces of degree 3, the paper [\cite=Ch07b] shows the following:

For a del Pezzo surface S, the first global log canonical threshold [formula] is meaningful by itself. It has a nice application to birational maps between del Pezzo fibrations (see [\cite=P99] or [\cite=P01]). The paper [\cite=P01] has computed all the values of [formula] for del Pezzo surfaces S of degree 1.

The aim of the present paper is to get all the values of the first global log canonical thresholds of Gorenstein canonical del Pezzo surfaces with singular points. This can be done by handling effective anticanonical divisors on the minimal resolutions of del Pezzo surfaces.

To this end, we are first required to have information on singularities of del Pezzo surfaces. This information can be obtained from [\cite=Dema80], [\cite=Furu86], [\cite=HiWa81], [\cite=MiZha88], [\cite=MiZha93], [\cite=U83], and [\cite=Zha88]. Instead of studying singularities of del Pezzo surfaces, we are able to understand them by studying configurations of - 2-curves on smooth surfaces with nef and big anticanonical divisor, so-called weak del Pezzo surfaces. We can also obtain information on effective anticanonical divisors on (weak) del Pezzo surfaces in such a way.

We have the following geometric descriptions for del Pezzo surfaces which provide us with the relation to weak del Pezzo surfaces and a way to construct effective anticanonical divisors.

Proof. See [\cite=Dema80] or [\cite=HiWa81]. [formula]

As we mentioned above, the singularities on a del Pezzo surface can be described by the configuration of - 2-curves on the minimal resolution of the del Pezzo surface that is a weak del Pezzo surface. Meanwhile, the configurations of - 2-curves can be shown effectively by their dual graphs (Dynkin diagrams). Proof. See [\cite=HiWa81] and [\cite=Pi77]. [formula]

For the sake of the first global log canonical thresholds, we need to distinguish some singularity types of del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 with the same dual graphs. To do so, we will distinguish [formula] singularities into two types. One has a - 1-curve intersecting the - 2-curve corresponding to the vertex v in the dual graph of [formula] such that [formula] on the minimal resolution of the del Pezzo surface. The other does not. In the former case the type of singularities will be denoted by [formula] and in the latter case by [formula]. For singularity types [formula] and [formula] on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2, there are two types for each (see [\cite=U83]). One is for [formula] and the other is for [formula]. For singularity type [formula] on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2, there are only one type (see [\cite=U83]). The singularity [formula] in this type is [formula].

Also, there are two types of singularities on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 with the dual graph [formula] (resp. [formula]) (see [\cite=U83]). One has a - 1-curve on the del Pezzo surface which passes through three [formula] singular points (denoted by [formula] (resp. [formula]). The other does not (denoted by [formula] (resp. [formula]). For singularity type [formula] on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2, there are only one type (see [\cite=U83]). The singularities [formula] in this type are [formula].

We are now at the stage where we can state the main theorem of the present paper.

The first log canonical thresholds of del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 have been dealt with in [\cite=P01].

Let π:S̃  →  S be the minimal resolution of S. Since we assume that the del Pezzo surface admits only Gorenstein canonical singularities, the resolution π is crepant, i.e., [formula] Therefore the pull-back D̃: = π*(D) of an effective anticanonical divisor D on S is an effective anticanonical divisor on S̃. We can write π*(D) =  + E, where [formula] is the strict transform of D and [formula] consists of - 2-curves.

Proof. It is easy to check. [formula]

For a constant c,

[formula]

Thus it is sufficient to consider D̃ on S̃ to compute [formula]. An effective anticanonical divisor D on S which does not pass through any singular point of S is not different from the pull-back of D via π. When we consider effective anticanonical divisors which pass through singular points of S, it suffices to investigate effective anticanonical divisors on the weak del Pezzo surface S̃ that contains a - 2-curve.

Since [formula] is always at most 1, classifying all effective anticanonical divisors in S̃ that has either at least one component with multiplicity ≥  2 or components that are not normal crossing, we can prove the main theorem. The classification will be presented in the following section.

The configuration of the anticanonical divisors.

Let us summarize the results of [\cite=P01]. Let S be a del Pezzo surface of degree 1 and π:S̃  →  S be the minimal resolution of S. Then for an effective anticanonical divisor D on S, the configuration of its pull-back divisor D̃ by the morphism π coincides with one of Kodaira's elliptic fibers. Lemma [\ref=counting] implies that every effective anticanonical divisor on S is irreducible and reduced since the degree of S is 1. If the divisor D passes through a singular point of S and the divisor D̃ has a multiple component, then we can see the dual graph of the divisor D̃ must be one of those that appear in the tables in Propositions [\ref=proposition:wt6], [\ref=proposition:wt4], [\ref=proposition:wt3], and [\ref=proposition:wt2]. For del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 we can obtain all the configurations of D̃ from [\cite=P01].

Every effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d can be obtained from an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d + 1 via a suitable blow-up.

Suppose that we have obtained the list of all the configurations of effective anticanonical divisors on weak del Pezzo surfaces of degree d. Let [formula] be an effective anticanonical divisor of a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d + 1, where each Ei is a - 2-curve and Dj is a prime divisor that is not a - 2-curve. In addition, let [formula]. Then we consider the blow up ψ of the weak del Pezzo surface of degree d + 1 at a point p in [formula] with [formula]. Then it produces a new effective anticanonical divisor on the weak del Pezzo surface of degree d that is the blow up by ψ. To be precise, we obtain

[formula]

where Ēi, j are the strict transforms of Ei, Dj, respectively, and F is the exceptional divisor of ψ. This effective anticanonical divisor should appear in the list of all the configurations of effective anticanonical divisors on weak del Pezzo surfaces of degree d that we have already obtained. Therefore, in order to obtain the list of all the configurations of effective anticanonical divisors on weak del Pezzo surfaces of degree d + 1 from the list for degree d, we have only to consider two cases, depending on bk = 1 or bk > 1, as follows:

Suppose that we have an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d whose dual graph Γd has a vertex v with weight 1 and self-intersection number j  ≥   - 2. Then there is the possibility that we have an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d + 1 whose dual graph is the same as Γd except that the vertex v has self-intersection number j + 1. This is the case where bk = 1 in the description above.

[formula]

Suppose that we have an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d whose dual graph Γd has a vertex w with weight b  ≥  1 and self-intersection number - 1 that has only one adjacent vertex v. We also suppose that the vertex v has weight b + 1 and self-intersection number j  ≥   - 2. Then there is the possibility that we have an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d + 1 whose dual graph is the same as Γd except that the vertex v has self-intersection number j + 1 and it has no w. This is the case where bk > 1 in the description above.

[formula]

Here the double lines mean that the vertex v can be connected to either one vertex or more than one vertex.

Let S̃ be a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d  ≤  7. Then there are 9 - d points pi,j, i,j  ≥  1, on the projective plane [formula] (infinitely near points allowed) in almost general position such that the blow up centered at these points is the surface S̃. We have a birational morphism [formula] that is a composition of a sequence of blow ups. Here each pi,1 is a point on [formula] and the point pi,j + 1 is a point on the exceptional divisor of the blow up at the point pi,j. The exceptional divisor of the blow up at the point pi,j is denoted by Ei,j. Then, we see

[formula]

For a divisor D on [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the strict transform of D by π. In particular, a cubic curve [formula] (not necessarily irreducible nor reduced) on [formula] defines an anticanonical divisor

[formula]

on the surface S̃.

For all the dual graphs in what follows, we will use the following notation to distinguish smooth rational curves with various self-intersection numbers;

The number near each vertex is the multiplicity of the curve corresponding to the vertex. The number 1 for multiplicity 1 will be always omitted.

In the tables of Propositions [\ref=proposition:wt6], [\ref=proposition:wt4], [\ref=proposition:wt3], and [\ref=proposition:wt2], some rows are marked with [formula]. We shall see in Section 3 that only those entries marked with  [formula] need be considered in order to prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] (see Propositions [\ref=change], [\ref=negative-curves-only] and [\ref=no-1]).

The columns labeled as Example carry configurations of divisors on certain blow ups of [formula] in order to show existence of anticanonical divisors of given types on weak del Pezzo surfaces. In each configuration, solid lines, which denote exceptional curves of blow-ups of [formula], will show the way of blow-ups of [formula]. Among the solid lines, thin lines (always drawn horizontally) denote - 1-curves and thick lines (always drawn slantingly) denote - 2-curves. The dotted curves in each configuration are the strict transformation of a cubic curve (not necessarily reduced nor irreducible) via the blow-ups. The letters L and Q right beside the dotted curves mean that each corresponding dotted curve is the strict transformation of a line and an irreducible conic, respectively. In addition, 2L and 3L mean the strict transformation of a double line and a triple line, respectively.

Since each curve in an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree 1 has weight at most 6, so does a curve in an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface.

Proof. Since there is no [formula] on a del Pezzo surface of degree 2, we have only P-2 possibilities. Furthermore, such a dual graph on a del Pezzo surface of degree ≥  2 has no vertex with weight 1. Therefore, we also have only P-2 possibilities after degree 2. [formula]

The weight 5 never appears as a maximum weight in an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface of degree 1 and the maximum weight is preserved under the changes by P-1 and P-2. Therefore, if an effective anticanonical divisor on a weak del Pezzo surface has multiplicity 5 along a curve, then it must have another curve along which it has multiplicity 6.

Proof. Let S̃ be a weak del Pezzo surface of degree d  ≤  7. Then it is obtained by suitable blow ups [formula]. Every effective anticanonical divisor on S̃ can be obtained from a cubic curve [formula] (not necessarily irreducible nor reduced) on [formula] as formula ([\ref=adjuction]) shows. Then for some (i,j), we must have [formula]. Since [formula] is non-increasing as k grows and the curve C is cubic, the possible sequences for [formula] have the form as follows:

[formula]

Therefore, the curve C consists of only lines.

Since at most three pi,k can be on a line, the first form is impossible, the second must be (3,2,2) and the last must be (3,3).

For the sequence (3,3), the curve C is a triple line. Exactly two points of pi,k are over C and hence the effective anticanonical divisor on S̃ given by C has no nonnegative self-intersection curve.

For the sequence (3,2,2), the curve C consists of one double line and one single line. We should take one blow up at the intersection point of the double line and the single line. Then two more blow ups at some points over the double line must follow. Therefore, the effective anticanonical divisor given by C has only one non-negative self-intersection curve and its self-intersection number is 0. [formula]

Proof. Starting from the [formula] dual graph for the degree 1 case, we apply [formula] and [formula] successively to get the possible dual graphs. Then from the obtained possible dual graphs, we exclude the dual graphs that violate the properties in Lemma [\ref=wt4]. [formula]

Proof. The proof is similar as that of Lemma [\ref=wt4]. In this case, the possible sequences for [formula] have the form as follows:

[formula]

Therefore, the curve C consists of only lines. We also see that the first form must be (2,2,2) and the second must be (3,2).

For the case (2,2,2), the curve C must consists of one double line and one single line. We also see that one blow up at a point on the double line but not on the single line must be taken. Then one blow up at the intersection point of the exceptional divisor and the strict transform of the double line must follow. And then one more blow up at the intersection point of the exceptional divisor of the second blow up and the strict transform of the double line must be taken.

For the case (3,2), the curve C must also consists of one double line and one single line. We must take the blow up at the intersection point of the double line and the single line. Then the blow up at a point on the strict transform of the double line but not on that of the single line must follow.

In both cases, the dual graph does not contain two 0-curves. If it contains a 1-curve, such a dual graph must be obtained in the way of the case (2,2,2). [formula]

Proof. Starting from the [formula] dual graph for the degree 1 case, we apply [formula] and [formula] successively to get the possible dual graphs. Then from the obtained possible dual graphs, we exclude the dual graphs that violate the properties in Lemma [\ref=wt3]. [formula]

For the dual graphs of effective anticanonical divisors on weak del Pezzo surfaces with a vertex of weight 2 as a maximum, let D̃ be such an anticanonical divisor. As in formula ([\ref=adjuction]), the divisor D̃ is of the form with the same notation for formula ([\ref=adjuction]).

For some (i,j), we must have [formula]. The possible sequences for [formula] have the form as follows:

[formula]

Furthermore, we can see that only the sequences

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

can happen. For the four sequences in the first row, the curve C must consist of one irreducible conic and a line intersecting tangentially. For the sequence in the second row, the curve C consists either of one irreducible conic and a line intersecting tangentially or of one double line and one single line. For the three sequences in the last row, the curve C consists either of one double line and one single line or of three lines intersecting at a single point.

When the curve C is given with one of the sequences above, the way to take blow ups is unique except the case where C consists of one irreducible conic and a line intersecting tangentially and the sequence is (2,2,1). This exceptional case has two ways to take blow ups. First, we take the blow up at the intersection point of the conic and the line. Then the blow up at the intersection point of the strict transforms of the conic and the line follows. For the last blow up, we have two choices. One is to take the blow up at the intersection point of the exceptional divisor of the second blow up and the strict transform of the conic, and the other is to take the blow up at the intersection point of the exceptional divisor of the second blow up and the strict transform of the line.

Proof. For the divisor D̃ to have either a 1-curve or a 2-curve, the sequence must be either (2,2,1) or (2,2). The curve C consists either of one irreducible conic and a line intersecting tangentially or of one double line and one single line. If the curve C consists of one irreducible conic and a line intersecting tangentially, then the conic becomes either a 1-curve or a 2-curve and the single line becomes either a - 1-curve or a - 2-curve. If the curve C consists of one double line and one single line, then the single line becomes a 1-curve and the double line becomes a - 1-curve. [formula]

Proof. If the dual graph of the divisor D̃ contains a chain consisting of five or four vertices with weight 2 and negative self-intersection, then we have two possibilities. One possibility is that we have either (2,2,1,1,1,1) or (2,2,1,1,1) for the sequence [formula] for some (i,j). In this case, the assertion is clear.

The other possibility is as follows: the curve C consists of one double line and one single line; for the sequence [formula], (3,1,1), (3,1), or (3) is attained over the intersection point of the double line and the single line; the sequence (2,2) is attained over a point on the double line but not on the single line. Then, the blow ups in the way corresponding to each sequence complete the proof. [formula]

Proof. For k = 0, only in the following cases the dual graph of D̃ can satisfy the required conditions. The first case is when we have the sequence (2,2,1,1). The other case is when the curve C consists of one double line and one single line; for the sequence [formula], (3) is attained over the intersection point of the double line and the single line; the sequence (2,2) is attained over a point on the double line but not on the single line. The blow ups in the way corresponding to each sequence complete the proof for the case k = 0.

For k = 1, only in the following cases the dual graph of D̃ can satisfy the required conditions. The first case is when we have the sequence (2,2,1). The other case is when the curve C consists of one double line and one single line with the sequence (2,2). [formula] Proof. For the divisor D̃ to have either two reduced 0-curves or three reduced 0-curves, the curve C consists of three lines intersecting at a single point with the sequence (3,1,1), (3,1) or (3). If the divisor D̃ has exactly one 2-curve, then the curve C consists of one irreducible conic and a line intersecting tangentially with the sequence (2,2) or (2,2,1). For (2,2,1), we have two ways to take blow ups as we mentioned right before Lemma [\ref=wt2-1]. For the assertion, we must take blow ups over three points over the line, not the conic. [formula] Proof. For the divisor D̃ to have a 0-curve with multiplicity 2, the curve C must consist of one double line and one single line. For such a double line to be a 0-curve, the sequence must be (3,1,1), (3,1) or (3). [formula]

Proof. Contracting five - 1-curves successively, we get a 0-curve on [formula]. This is a contradiction.  [formula]

Proof. Starting from the dual graphs for the degree 1 case, we apply [formula] and [formula] successively to get the possible dual graphs. Then from the obtained possible dual graphs, we exclude the dual graphs that violate the properties in Lemmas [\ref=wt2-1], [\ref=wt2-2], [\ref=wt2-3], [\ref=wt2-4], [\ref=wt2-5] and [\ref=wt2-6]. [formula]

Proof. The assertion holds for a weak del Pezzo surface of degree 1 (see [\cite=P01]). Notice that we can apply only P-1. Then the assertion is clear. [formula]

Proof. Considering successive suitable blow ups of a cuspidal cubic, three lines intersecting at a single point, and a conic and a line intersecting tangentially on [formula], we can easily obtain the assertions. [formula]

Log canonical threshold.

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main]. For given singularity types, we consider all the possible effective anticanonical divisors. However, we do not have to consider all effective anticanonical divisors. It turns out that we have only to consider those which appear in the tables of Propositions [\ref=proposition:wt6], [\ref=proposition:wt4], [\ref=proposition:wt3], [\ref=proposition:wt2] with the mark [formula] and those described in Proposition [\ref=rational]. In what follows we explain the reason.

Proof. By Riemann-Roch,

[formula]

since h0(S̃,O(KS̃ - D2)) = 0. Consider the exact sequence

[formula]

We then see that D2 - L is linearly equivalent to an effective divisor D3 since

[formula]

Furthermore, D23 = (D2 - L)2 = D22 + L2 - 2D2  ·  L  ≤  D22 - 1.

If D22 = 0, then - KS̃  ·  D3 = (D1 + D2)  ·  (D2 - L) = 1. Since D3 is a part of an effective anticanonical divisor with a - 2-curve, it consists of rational curves. Therefore, we can conclude that D3 consists of one - 1-curve and - 2-curves. [formula]

Proof. We have a sequence of blow ups [formula]. Then the curve C is the strict transform of a line, a conic or a singular cubic on [formula]. If the curve C comes from a singular cubic, then the singular point must be the center of an exceptional divisor of π. Suppose that there is at least two - 1-curves on S̃ that are exceptional curves of π and C intersects with all the - 1-curves. Choose two points among the centers of all exceptional curves of π in such a way that if the curve C comes from a singular cubic, the singular point is one of the two points. The strict transform of the line passing through the chosen two points does not meet C and it is a - 1-curve; otherwise the curve C would not be irreducible. On the other hand, if there is exactly one exceptional - 1-curve of π such that C intersects with this line, then the center of the exceptional curves on [formula] is one point and the curve C must be the strict transform of either a conic or a singular cubic. If C is the strict transform of a conic, consider the line on [formula] that is tangent to a conic at the point of the center. If C is the strict transform of a singular cubic, consider the line on [formula] that is one of components of the tangent cone of the singular point of the cubic. Then the strict transform of the tangent line on S̃ does not intersect C and it is a - 1-curve on S̃. [formula]

From now on, for a divisor D on S̃ we define

[formula]

Proof. Suppose that the divisor D contains a non-negative curve C. Let [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=line], there is a - 1-curve L with C  ·  L = 0. Then we obtain an effective divisor F with F2  ≤  C2 - 1 such that C is linearly equivalent to L + F by Lemma [\ref=change]. We replace D by the effective divisor D - mC + m(L + F). Note that [formula]. Repeating this procedure finitely many times we get the required effective anticanonical divisor.  [formula]

Proof. Let E be a - 2-curve in D1 that is not a component of D2 and does not intersect at least one - 1-curve in D2. By blowing down - 1-curves k + 1 times from the - 1-curve that does not intersect E, we get a 0-curve that is contained in an effective anticanonical divisor containing - 2-curve on a new weak del Pezzo surface.

We then apply Lemma [\ref=line] to obtain the required - 1-curve. [formula]

Proof. Let E be a - 2-curve in D1 that is not a component of D2 and not connected to any - 2-curve between two - 1-curves in D2. Applying Lemma [\ref=line2] to the divisor obtained by subtracting two - 2-curves at the ends of D2 from D2, we see that there is a - 1-curve L that intersects either E or one of two - 2-curves at the ends of D2. If the - 1-curve L intersects E, then we are done. Therefore, we suppose that the curve L intersects one of two - 2-curves at the ends of D2.

If k = 0, then we contract L and then blow down - 1-curves as follows:

If k = 1, then we blow down - 1-curves as follows:

In both cases, we get a 2-curve that is contained in an effective anticanonical divisor on a new weak del Pezzo surface. The weak del-Pezzo surface is of degree ≤  7, Lemma [\ref=line] implies the assertion.

Now we suppose k  ≥  2. By contracting L we get a divisor on a new weak del Pezzo surface whose dual graph is as follows:

Then we blow down - 1-curves k times from the - 1-curve on the left to the right. Then we obtain a divisor on a new weak del Pezzo surface whose dual graph is as follows:

where [formula] is the curve from the - 2-curve at the left end of D2. Again we contract the - 1-curve in the middle. Then we get a divisor on a new weak del Pezzo surface whose dual graph is as follows:

Suppose that all - 1-curve on this surface are connected to this divisor. Then we contract all the - 1-curves so that we obtain either [formula] or [formula]. However, since the - 2-curves E has never been touched by any - 1-curve, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there is a - 1-curve that does not intersect the divisor D2. [formula]

Proof. The dual graph of the divisor D must be circular.

First, we suppose that the divisor D contains at least three - 1-curves.

If either its dual graph contains at least two chains of - 1-curves or it contains at least four - 1-curves and only one chain of - 1-curves, then we can obtain a divisor D2 from D that satisfies the conditions of Lemma [\ref=line2]. Furthermore, we can pick a - 1-curve L from the divisor D not intersecting D2. Then Proposition [\ref=change] implies the assertion.

If the dual graph contains exactly three - 1-curves and only one chain of - 1-curves, we let L1, L2, L3 be the three - 1-curves with L1  ·  L3 = 0. Then the divisor D2 = L1 + L2 must have a - 1-curve L that dose not intersect D2 by Lemma [\ref=line2]. If the - 1-curve L intersects the - 2-curve that intersects L3, then the divisor L1 + L2 must be linearly equivalent to an divisor L + R, where R is an effective divisor, by Proposition [\ref=change]. Then D - L1 - L2 + L + R is an effective anticanonical divisor whose dual graph has a fork. Therefore, it must have a multiple component. If the curve L intersects the - 2-curve that intersects L1, then the divisor L2 + L3 and the - 1-curve L work for the assertion in the same manner.

Secondly, we suppose that the divisor D contains only two - 1-curves. Consider the divisor D1 < D that consists of the two - 1-curves and all the - 2-curves contained in the chain from one - 1-curve to the other not longer than the other side. Note that D1 contains no - 2-curve if two - 1-curves are connected. Lemma [\ref=line3] shows that there is a - 1-curve L that intersects a - 2-curve not in D1 and not connected to the - 1-curves in D1. Proposition [\ref=change] then implies that the divisor D is linearly equivalent to an effective anticanonical divisor whose dual graph has a fork. This completes the proof. [formula]

Therefore, Propositions [\ref=negative-curves-only] and [\ref=no-1] show that we do not have to consider effective anticanonical divisors without a multiple curve except those in Proposition [\ref=rational]. Furthermore, applying Proposition [\ref=change] with Lemmas [\ref=line] and [\ref=line2] to effective anticanonical divisors with a multiple curve we are able to obtain a short list of effective anticanonical divisors with a multiple curve to be considered for the first log canonical thresholds. Such divisors are marked by [formula] in the tables. This short list gives a proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].
