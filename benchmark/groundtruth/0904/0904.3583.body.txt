Weak Continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci System for Isometric Embedding

Introduction

The Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system is a fundamental system of nonlinear partial differential equations in differential geometry (cf. [\cite=BGY] [\cite=BS] [\cite=Eisenhart] [\cite=Goenner] [\cite=Greene] [\cite=NM] [\cite=Spivak]). For example, the fundamental theorem of the surface theory indicates that the existence of a local or global solution of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system can yield a local or global higher dimensional isometric embedding. Therefore, it is important to understand the behavior of this nonlinear system for solving isometric embedding problems and other important geometric problems. In general, the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system has no type, neither purely hyperbolic nor purely elliptic.

We are concerned with the weak continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system and related compensated compactness framework for approximate solutions to this system. In Chen-Slemrod-Wang [\cite=CSW2], we noted that the Gauss-Codazzi equations for isometric embedding of [formula] into [formula] fall naturally within the formation of compensated compactness. In this paper, we first show that this is also true in the general case for the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system. One of our main observations here is that the Codazzi and Ricci equations naturally have the Div-Curl structure. Based on this observation, we establish the week continuity of this system with respect to the uniform Lp-bounded solution sequence for p > 2, which implies that the weak limit of the isometric embeddings of the manifold is still an isometric embedding. This is reminiscent of the weak continuity of determinants which plays an essential role in the theory of polyconvexity by Ball [\cite=Ball] in nonlinear elasticity (also see Dacorogna [\cite=Dacorogna], Evans [\cite=Evans], Morrey [\cite=Mo66], and Müller [\cite=Muller]). More generally, we establish a stronger compensated compactness framework for the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system. That is, given any sequence of approximate solutions to this system which is uniformly bounded in L2, and has reasonable bounds on the errors made in the approximation (the errors are confined in a compact subset of [formula]), then the approximating sequence has a weakly convergent subsequence whose limit is still a solution of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system. For these, no restriction on the Riemann curvature tensor is made.

A long-standing fundamental problem in differential geometry is the existence of local (and if possible global) embeddings of a d-dimensional Riemannian manifold [formula], d  ≥  3, into the Euclidean space [formula] with optimal dimension N. As noted in Han-Hong [\cite=HanHong], the first global existence of smooth embeddings was given by Nash [\cite=Nash1], but the best result as of this time is the following theorem of Günther [\cite=Gunther]: Any smooth d-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold admits a smooth (i.e. C∞) isometric embedding in [formula] for [formula]. Needless to say, it is of considerable interest to know if Günther's dimension N is optimal. In a similar vein, we could try to formulate a selection or "admissibility" criterion to choose one of the possibly infinite embeddings provided by Günther's theorem. Within the realm of surface theory and elastic manifolds, this has been recently considered in [\cite=Witten1] [\cite=Witten2] where the selection is done by minimizing an integral of norm of the second fundamental form. Indeed, this seems a natural approach for selection in the general case and is even in the same spirit of Dafermos's entropy rate criterion [\cite=Dafermos-book]. In Section 4, we propose a minimizing problem as a selection criterion and show by the compensated compactness framework that any minimizing sequence has a subsequence in Lp,p > 2, which converges weakly to a minimizer that satisfies the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system. Since any sequence of isometric embeddings of [formula] into [formula] (say given by Günther's theorem) must satisfy the equations exactly, this implies that the problem of minimizing the Lp-norms of the second fundamental form and the connection form on the normal bundle (sometimes called torsion coefficients [\cite=BS]) does have a solution within the class of weak solutions of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system, hence yielding an isometric immersion of W2,p class for p > 2.

The Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci System for Isometric Embedding of [formula] into [formula]

In this section, we use the following conventional notation: where the indices a,b,c run from 1 to N, and i,j,k,l,m,n run from 1 to d  ≥  3.

For given metric gij, the Christoffel symbols are

[formula]

which depend on the first derivatives of (gij), and the Riemann curvature tensor is

[formula]

which depends on (gij) and its first and second derivatives, where (gkl) denotes the inverse of (gij) and ∂j  =  ∂xj. We denote |g| = det(gij).

The Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci System

As is well-known in Riemannian Geometry, the isometric embedding problems for d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds into the Euclidean space [formula] can be reduced as the solvability problems of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system of nonlinear partial differential equations with the following form:

The Gauss equations:

[formula]

The Codazzi equations:

[formula]

The Ricci equations:

[formula]

Notice that the coefficients of the second fundamental form are symmetric:

[formula]

while the coefficients of the connection form on the normal bundle are antisymmetric:

[formula]

In particular, the antisymmetry of κakb implies

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Thus, the ath column of the d  ×  d matrix κa is zero.

When d = 3, the Janet dimension [formula] (cf. Janet [\cite=Janet]). Then

The Div-Curl Structure of the Codazzi and Ricci Equations

In this section we present one of our main observations on the features of the Codazzi and Ricci equations: the Div-Curl structure, which leads to the weak continuity of the system.

For [formula],

[formula]

is a d  ×  d matrix field.

From the Codazzi equations [\eqref=C1], for k < l, they possess the form:

[formula]

or

[formula]

and

[formula]

where l.o.t represents the lower-order terms without involving derivatives in the equation.

Similarly, we observe that the identical form of the Ricci equations [\eqref=R1] can also be written as

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now replacing a by b, and j by i in the Codazzi equations [\eqref=C11]-[\eqref=C12], we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly, replacing a by b and b by c in the Ricci equations [\eqref=R11]-[\eqref=R12], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The div-curl lemma asserts that if we have an approximate sequence haij,κclb uniformly bounded in [formula], for which the right hand sides of our div, curl equalities lie in compact subsets of [formula], then scalar product of any pair of vectors in our Codazzi and Ricci list is weakly continuous in Lp(Ω).

One of our main observations is that the scalar product of the two vector fields in the rewritten forms [\eqref=C11]-[\eqref=R14] yield the nonlinear quantities in the lower-order terms in the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1]: Forms [\eqref=C11] and [\eqref=C14] yield

[formula]

forms [\eqref=R11] and [\eqref=R14] yield

[formula]

and forms [\eqref=R12] and [\eqref=C13] yield

[formula]

This observation is essential for us to establish the weak continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system in § 3.

For simplicity we first do our computation with d = 3. From the Codazzi equations [\eqref=C1], set k = 1,l = 2;  k = 2,l = 3;  k = 1,l = 3. Then they possess the form: or and in addition,

[formula]

We note the identical form of the Ricci equations [\eqref=R1], i.e., and,

[formula]

Now replace a by b, and j by k in our Codazzi list to obtain Similarly, replace a by b and b by c in our Ricci equations to obtain

The Div-Curl lemma asserts that if we have an approximate sequence haij,κclb uniformly bounded in [formula], for which the right hand sides of our div, curl equalities lie in compact subsets of [formula], then scalar product of any pair of vectors in our Codazzi and Ricci list is weakly continuous in Lp(Ω).

Let us do scalar product of the two Codazzi lists, the two Ricci lists, and Codazzi and Ricci equations.

(i) Codazzi-Codazzi (the curl of one list with the div's of the other list): (ii) Ricci-Ricci (the curl of one list with the div's of the other list): (iii) Ricci-Codazzi: Let us repalce a by b in our first Codazzi list to obtain: So again if we compute the scalar product of curl from the first Ricci list and div's from the above Codazzi list, we obtain: Thus we have proved that for any approximate sequence {haij,κclb} of solutions to the Codazzi-Ricci equations which is uniformly bounded in [formula], and for which the errors lie in a compact subset of [formula], the quadratic terms occuring in the Gauss equations [\eqref=G1], Codazzi equations [\eqref=C1], and the Ricci equations [\eqref=R1] are weakly continuous in Lp(Ω).

Weak Continuity and Compensated Compactness Framework

In this section we establish the weak continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system and related compensated compactness framework for approximate solutions to the system via the Div-Curl lemma (see Murat [\cite=Murat1] and Tartar [\cite=Tartar1]).

The Div-Curl lemma is a basic result in the compensated compactness theory for the weak continuity of the scalar product of two vector fields (cf. [\cite=Dacorogna] [\cite=Evans] [\cite=Murat1] [\cite=Murat2] [\cite=Tartar1] [\cite=Tartar2]) and is closely related with the Hodge decomposition.

Let [formula] be open bounded. Let p,q > 1 such that [formula]. Assume that, for any ε > 0, two fields [formula] and [formula] satisfy the following:

[formula] weakly in [formula] as ε  →  0;

[formula] weakly in [formula] as ε  →  0;

div  uε are confined in a compact subset of [formula];

curl  vε are confined in a compact subset of [formula].

Then the scalar product of [formula] and [formula] are weakly continuous:

[formula]

in the sense of distributions.

Based on our observation of the Div-Curl structure of the Codazzi and Ricci equations, we employ the Div-Curl lemma to formulate the following compensated compactness framework.

Let a sequence of vector fields [formula], defined on an open bounded subset [formula], satisfy the following Framework (A):

(A.1)  [formula] for some C > 0 independent of ε > 0;

(A.2)  [formula] and [formula] are confined in a compact set in H- 1loc(Ω);

{ (A.3)  There exist oεj(1),j = 1,2,3, with oεj(1)  →  0 in the sense of distributions as ε  →  0 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we have

Let a sequence of vector fields (ha,εij,κa,εlb) satisfy Framework (A). Then there exists a subsequence (still labeled) (ha,εij,κa,εlb) that converges weakly in L2(Ω) to (haij,κalb) as ε  →  0 such that

[formula];

the quadratic terms in [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1] are weakly continuous with respect to the subsequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) that converges to (haij,κalb) weakly in L2(Ω) as ε  →  0;

the limit vector field (haij,κalb) satisfies the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1].

That is, the limit vector field (haij,κalb) is a weak solution to the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1].

By assumption (A.1), there exists a subsequence (still denoted) (ha,εij,κa,εlb) and a vector field (haij,κalb)∈L2(Ω) such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

By the Div-Curl structure, observed in § 2.2, assumption (A.2) implies that

[formula]

and

[formula]

are confined in a compact set in   H- 1loc(Ω).

By exchanging the indices, we also have

[formula]

and

[formula]

are confined in a compact set in   H- 1loc(Ω).

Using the Div-Curl lemma, Theorem 3.1, we conclude that the weak continuity of the nonlinear quadratic quantities in the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system with respect to the sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb):

[formula]

in the sense of distributions as ε  →  0.

Combining [\eqref=3.3]-[\eqref=3.4] with [\eqref=3.9]-[\eqref=3.11], we conclude that the weak limit vector field (haij,κalb) of the sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) satisfy the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1] in the sense of distributions, that is, the limit vector field (haij,κalb) is a weak solution of [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1].

As a corollary, we conclude the weak continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system with respect to the uniform Lp-bounded solution sequence for p > 2.

Let (ha,εij,κa,εlb) be a sequence of solutions to the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1], which is uniformly bounded in Lp, p > 2. Then the weak limit vector field (haij,κalb) of the sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) in Lp is still a solution to [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1].

Since the solution sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) is uniformly bounded in Lp, p > 2:

[formula]

for some C > 0 independent of ε, then there exists a subsequence (still denoted) (ha,εij,κa,εlb) and a vector field (haij,κalb)∈Lp(Ω) such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we conclude from [\eqref=p-bound] that all the lower-order terms for the solution sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) in the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1] are uniformly bounded in Lp / 2,p > 2. This implies that

[formula]

Since the domain [formula] is bounded, the uniform bound in [\eqref=p-bound] implies the uniform bound of (ha,εij,κa,εlb) in L2(Ω). By the compensated compactness framework (Theorem 3.2), we conclude that the limit vector field is a weak solution of [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1], which implies the weak continuity of the system.

The weak continuity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system implies that, for p > 2, the weak limit of a sequence of isometric embeddings of the d-dimensional manifold [formula] into [formula] as surfaces with corresponding uniform Lp-bounded sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) is still an isometric embedding as a surface in [formula]. The requirement p > 2 is to ensure the H- 1-compactness in [\eqref=h-compact] to deal with the nonhomogeneous terms.

Minimization Problem

In this section, as an example, we show that the solution sequence (ha,εij,κa,εlb) for the weak continuity in Theorem 3.3 can be obtained from a selection criterion.

There exists a minimizer (haij,κalb) for the minimization problem:

[formula]

where S is the set of weak solutions to the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1].

Clearly, S is non-empty by Günther's theorem in [\cite=Gunther] (also see the statement in § 1 above). A minimizing sequence provides the desired Lp-norm for the weak continuity theorem (Theorem 3.3). Since the Lp-norm is convex, which is weakly lower semicontinuous, any minimizing sequence has a subsequence in Lp(Ω) that converges weakly to a minimizer which satisfies the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1].

Notice that any sequence of isometric embeddings of [formula] into [formula] as surfaces (say, given by Günther's theorem) must satisfy the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1]. This implies that the problem of minimizing the Lp-norms of the second fundamental form and the connection form on the normal bundle does have a solution within the class of weak solutions of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system [\eqref=G1]-[\eqref=R1], hence yielding an isometric immersion of W2,p class for p > 2 for [formula] into [formula] as a surface.
