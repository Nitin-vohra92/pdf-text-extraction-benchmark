Abstract

There has for longer been an interest in finding equivalent conditions which define inner product spaces, and the respective literature is considerable, see for instance Amir, which lists 350 such results. Here, in this tradition, an alternative definition of orthogonality is presented which does not make use of any inner product. This definition, in the spirit of the recently developed non-wellfounded set theory, is self-referential, or circulatory.

0. Preliminaries

Let us note that a group [formula] is defined by properties of its subgroups generated by no more than 3 elements. Indeed, the axioms of a group are

(0.1) [formula]

(0.2) [formula]

(0.3) [formula]

(0.4) [formula]

Clearly, vector spaces are also defined by properties of their vector subspaces generated by no more than 3 elements.

On the other hand, the conditions that a vector space X be a normed space (X,|| ~ ||) will only involve its 2 dimensional vector subspaces, namely

(0.5) [formula]

(0.6) [formula]

(0.7) [formula]

Obviously, the same goes for finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where the scalar product, and in particular, orthogonality only involve 2-dimensional vector subspaces.

In the case of infinite dimensional vector spaces, just like with infinite dimensional Banach spaces, completeness is also required, a condition which, of course, is no longer definable in terms of any finite dimensional vector subspaces.

It can in general be recalled the important role of the structure of finite dimensional vector spaces in the study of arbitrary normed spaces, as illustrated by the earlier and more particular Khinchin, and the later Grothendieck inequalities.

In the sequel, we shall consider the issue of orthogonality, and do so without the need to deal with completeness.

1. Linear Independence

Let V be a vector space on [formula], and m  ≥  2, then we denote

(1.1) [formula]

which is nonvoid, if and only if dim V ≥   m.

Further, for (a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am)∈Ind  m  V we denote by

(1.2) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ span  (a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am)

the vector subspace in V generated by a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am. Then for every m-dimensional vector subspace E of V, we obviously we have

(1.3) [formula]

2. Usual orthogonality based on inner product

Here for convenience and for setting the notation, we review the usual case of orthogonality, namely, that which is defined based on an inner product. Given any inner product [formula], then for m  ≥  2, we denote

(2.1) [formula]

Now, if (a1,. ~ . ~ . ~ .,am)∈Ort  m  V(  <   ~ , ~   >  ), then for any vector x∈span  (a1,. ~ . ~ . ~ .,am), we have in a unique manner, see (1.3)

(2.2) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ x ~  =  ~ Σ1  ≤  i  ≤  m  ~  λi(a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am,x)  ai

where this time we have in addition the simple explicit formulae

(2.3) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ λi(a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am,x) ~  =  ~   <  ai,x  >    /    <  ai,ai > , ~  ~  ~ 1  ≤  i  ≤  m

Remark 1.

An important point to note is that each λi(a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am,x) in (2.2), (2.3) can in fact only depend on x and ai, but not on aj, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, ~ j  ≠  i. Indeed, in view of (1.3), x obviously does not depend on a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am.

[formula]

For the sake of clarity, we recall here that by inner product on V we mean a function [formula], such that

(2.4)      <   ~ , ~   >   ~  ~

(2.5)      <  x,.  >   ~  ~  ~  ~ V

(2.6)      <  x,x  >    ~    ≥    ~  0

(2.7)    [formula]

3. Orthogonality without inner product

In view of the above it may appear that one could give the following definition of orthogonality without inner product, namely

Definition 1.

If m  ≥  2 and (a1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,am)∈Ind  m  V, then by definition

(3.1) [formula]

Consequently, we denote

(3.2) [formula]

Remark 2.

One should note above that the meaning of "does not depend on" in (3.1) needs further clarification. Indeed, when we are given an explicit expression, such as for instance in (2.3), then it is quite clear what "does not depend on" means, since the entities on which the respective expressions are supposed not to depend simply do not appear in the respective expressions.

However, in (3.1) we are actually dealing with (1.3). And then, the meaning of

" [formula] "

is not so immediately obvious.

4. The two dimensional case

Orthogonality, in its simplest nontrivial case, involves only two nonzero vectors, hence it is a property which can already be formulated in 2-dimensional vector spaces. Let therefore E be any 2-dimensional vector space on [formula]. Then the property in (1.3) becomes

(4.1) [formula]

Therefore, in view of (3.1) in the above Definition 1 which does not use inner product for defining orthogonality, we have

Proposition 1.

Given (a,b)∈Ind  2  E, then

(4.2) [formula]

[formula]

Clearly, if we want to consider the concept of orthogonality in its natural minimal nontrivial context of 2-dimensionality, then we can take the above property (4.2) as a definition of orthogonality, without the use of inner product, instead of referring to the more general condition (3.1) in Definition 1.

Remark 3.

It is useful to note the following. For every two vectors (a,b)∈Ind  2  E, there exists an inner product <   ~ , ~   >  a,  b on E, such that <  a,b  >  a,  b    =    0, that is, a and b are orthogonal with respect to <   ~ , ~   >  a,  b , or equivalently, (a,b)∈Ort  2  E(  <   ~ , ~   >  a,  b). This, however, does not contradict (4.2), since in such a case we still have, see (4.1)

(4.3) [formula]

with, see (2.3), (4.2)

(4.4) [formula]

5. One possible meaning of "Does not depend on"

Here we shall specify within a rather general context one possible meaning of the above property "does not depend on", which was used in (3.1) and (4.2).

Given a function f:Δ  ⊆  X  ×  Y  →  Z, where X,Y and Z are arbitrary sets, and further given Γ  ⊆  Δ, we say that, on Γ, the function f does not depend on x∈X, if and only if there exists a function g:prY(Γ)  ⊆  Y  →  Z, such that

(5.1) [formula]

or equivalently, we have the commutative diagram

where prY:X  ×  Y∋(x,y)  ↦  y∈Y is the usual projection mapping.

The above concept can easily be adapted to the case of m  ≥  2 functions

(5.3) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ f1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,fm:Δ  ⊆  X1  ×   ~ . ~ . ~ . ~   ×  Xm  ×  Y  ~    →    ~  Z

where X1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,Xm,Y and Z are arbitrary sets. Indeed, given Γ  ⊆  Δ, we say that, on Γ, each function fi, with 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, does not depend on xj∈Xj, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, ~ j  ≠  i, if and only if there exist functions

(5.4) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ gi:prXi  ×  Y(Γ)  ⊆  Xi  ×  Y  ~    →    ~  Z, ~  ~  ~ 1  ≤  i  ≤  m

such that

(5.5) [formula]

Returning to the Definition in section 2, we note that there we have

(5.6) [formula]

It follows that

(5.7) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ Ort  m  V ~  =  ~ prX1  ×   ~ . ~ . ~ .  ×  Xm  Γ

And in the particular case when

(5.8) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ dim ~ V ~  =  ~ m

we obtain the simpler forms

(5.9) [formula]

Furthermore, through any vector space isomorphism between V and [formula], we obtain

(5.10) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ Ind  m  V ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ Vm, ~  ~  ~  ~ Δ ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ Vm  +  1

Obviously, for m  =  2, the relations (5.9) and (5.10) apply as well to the situation in (4.1) and (4.2).

6. Maximality

With the notation in (5.3) - (5.5), let Γ  ⊆  Δ, and let us suppose that, on Γ, each function fi, with 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, does not depend on xj∈Xj, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, ~ j  ≠  i. Then obviously, the same holds on every subset [formula].

Let now Γα  ⊆  Δ, with α∈A, be a family of subsets which is totally ordered by inclusion. Further, let us suppose that on each Γα, each of the functions fi, with 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, does not depend on xj∈Xj, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, ~ j  ≠  i. The according to (5.4), (5.5), there exist functions

(6.1) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ gα,  i:prXi  ×  Y(Γα)  ⊆  Xi  ×  Y  ~    →    ~  Z, ~  ~  ~ α∈A, ~  ~ 1  ≤  i  ≤  m

such that

(6.2) [formula]

If we consider now the subset

(6.3) [formula]

then for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, we obviously have

(6.4) [formula]

hence in view of (6.1), (6.2), there exists a function

(6.5) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ gi:prXi  ×  Y(Γ)  ⊆  Xi  ×  Y  ~    →    ~  Z

such that

(6.6) [formula]

In view of the above and the Zorn lemma, we obtain

Lemma

Given

(6.7) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ f1, ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ,fm:Δ  ⊆  X1  ×   ~ . ~ . ~ . ~   ×  Xm  ×  Y  ~    →    ~  Z

and a nonvoid subset Γ  ⊆  Δ, such that, on Γ, each function fi, with 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, does not depend on xj∈Xj, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, ~ j  ≠  i. Then there exists

(6.8) ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~   ⊆  Δ, ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~   ⊇  Γ

such that, on [formula], each function fi, with 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, does not depend on xj∈Xj, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, ~ j  ≠  i.

Remark 4.

A similar Lemma obviously holds for the particular situation in (5.1), (5.2).

Theorem

Γ as defined in (5.6) is maximal.

Proof

It follows easily.

7. The self-referentiality or circularity of orthogonality

In section 5 one possible precise meaning of "does not depend on", a concept used in (3.1) and (4.2), was presented. However, in view of the expressions of Γ and Ort  m  V in (5.6), (5.7), or for that matter, in (5.9), it is obvious that a self-referentiality or circularity appears with respect to the concept of orthogonality when one defines it - as in (3.1), (3.2) or (4.2) - without any inner product.

In this regard, and in view of recent developments in what is called non-wellfounded set theory, see Barwise & Moss, Forti & Honsell, Aczél, and the literature cited there, such self-referential or circulatory definitions are acceptable.

A detailed application of non-welfounded set theory to the above problem of orthogonality will be presented in a number of subsequent papers.
