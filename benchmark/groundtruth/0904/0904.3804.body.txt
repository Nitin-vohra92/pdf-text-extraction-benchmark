Calderón inverse Problem for the Schrödinger Operator on Riemann Surfaces

Notice that when Δg + Vi do not have L2 eigenvalues for the Dirichlet condition, the statement above can be given in terms of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. Since Δĝ = e- 2φΔg when ĝ = e2φg for some function φ, it is clear that in the statement in Theorem [\ref=identif], we only need to fix the conformal class of g instead of the metric g (or equivalently to fix the complex structure on M). Observe also that Theorem [\ref=identif] implies that, for a fixed Riemann surface with boundary (M0,g), the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the operator [formula] determines the isotropic conductivity γ if γ∈C4(M0) in the sense that two conductivities giving rise to the same Dirichlet-to-Neumann are equal. This is a standard observation by transforming the conductivity problem to a potential problem with potential [formula]. So our result also extends that of Henkin-Michel [\cite=HM] in the case of isotropic conductivities.

The method to reconstruct the potential follows [\cite=Bu] [\cite=IUY] and is based on the construction of special complex geometric optic solutions of (Δg + V)u = 0, more precisely solutions of the form u = eΦ / h(a + r(h)) where h > 0 is a small parameter, Φ and a are holomorphic functions on (M,g) and r(h) is an error term small as h  →  0. The idea of [\cite=Bu] to reconstruct V(p) for p∈M is to take Φ with a non-degenerate critical point at p and then use staionary phase as h  →  0. In our setting, one of our main contribution is the construction of the holomorphic Carleman weights Φ which is quite more complicated since we are working on a Riemann surface instead of a domain of [formula]. We also need to prove a Carleman estimate on the surface for this degenerate weight.

A trivial consequence we mention is an inverse result for the scattering operator on asymptotically hyperbolic (AH in short) surfaces for potential decaying at the boundary. Recall that an AH surface is an open complete Riemannian surface (X,g) such that X is the interior of a smooth compact surface with boundary X̄, and for any smooth boundary defining function x of ∂X̄, : = x2g extends as a smooth metric to X̄, with curvature tending to - 1 at ∂X̄. If V∈C∞(X̄) and V = O(x2), then we can define a scattering map as follows (see for instance [\cite=JSB] [\cite=GRZ] or [\cite=GG]): first the L2 kernel ker L2(Δg + V) is a finite dimensional subspace of xC∞(X̄) and in one-to-one correspondence with E: = {(∂xψ)|∂X̄;ψ∈ ker L2(Δg + V)} where [formula] is the normal vector field to ∂X̄ for [formula], then for f∈C∞(∂X̄) / E, there exists a unique function u∈C∞(X̄) such that (Δg + V)u = 0 and u|∂X̄ = f, then one can see that the scattering map ∞(∂X̄) / E  →  C∞(∂X̄) / E is defined by [formula]. We thus obtain

To conclude, we consider the case of inverse scattering at 0 frequency for Δ + V with V compactly supported on an asymptotically Euclidean surface. An asymptotically Euclidean surface is a non-compact Riemann surface (X,g), which compactifies into X̄ and such that the metric in a collar (0,ε)x  ×  ∂X̄ near the boundary is of the form

[formula]

where h(x) is a smooth one-parameter family of metrics on ∂X̄ with h(0) = dθ2S1 is the metric with length 2π on each copy of S1 that forms the connected components of ∂X̄. Notice that using the coordinates r: = 1 / x, g is asymptotic to dr2 + r2dθ2S1 near r  →    ∞  . A particular case is given by the surfaces with Euclidean ends, ie. ends isometric to [formula] where [formula]. The elements of kernel of Δg + V which have polynomial growth of order, say, [formula] at ∞   form a finite dimensional vector space of dimension increasing with N, so it is clear that one can not expect to recover much information from this space. Thus in a sense, the Cauchy data space at 0 frequency can be interpreted as the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of tempered solutions of (Δg + V)u = 0, we mean the solutions which lie in a weighted space xαL2 for some [formula]. We show

Let (X,g) be an asymptotically Euclidean surface and let V1,V2 be two compactly supported C2 potentials in X. Assume that for all [formula] and for any element ψ in ker xαL2(Δg + V1) there is a φ∈ ker xαL2(Δg + V2) such that φ  -  ψ = O(x∞) and conversely. Then V1 = V2.

We remark that a similar statement could be proved along the same lines without difficulties for asymptotically conic manifolds but we prefer to restrict to the asymptotically Euclidean case for simplicity.

Another straightforward corollary in the asymptotically Euclidean case is the recovery of a compactly supported potential from the scattering operator at a positive frequency. The proof is essentially the same as for the operator [formula] once one know Theorem [\eqref=identif].

Riemann surfaces

Let (M0,g0) be a compact connected smooth Riemannian surface with boundary ∂M0. The surface M0 can be considered as a subset of a compact Riemannian surface (M,g), for instance by taking the double of M0 and extending smoothly the metric g0 to M. The conformal class of g on the closed surface M induces a structure of closed Riemann surface, i.e. a closed surface equipped with a complex structure via holomorphic charts [formula]. The Hodge star operator [formula] acts on the cotangent bundle T*M, its eigenvalues are ±  i and the respective eigenspace [formula] and [formula] are sub-bundle of the complexified cotangent bundle [formula] and the splitting [formula] holds as complex vector spaces. Since [formula] is conformally invariant on 1-forms on M, the complex structure depends only on the conformal class of g. In holomorphic coordinates z = x + iy in a chart Uα, one has [formula] and

[formula]

where dz = dx + idy and d = dx - idy. We define the natural projections induced by the splitting of [formula]

[formula]

The exterior derivative d defines the De Rham complex 0  →  Λ0  →  Λ1  →  Λ2  →  0 where Λk: = ΛkT*M denotes the real bundle of k-forms on M. Let us denote [formula] the complexification of Λk, then the ∂ and [formula] operators can be defined as differential operators [formula] and [formula] by

[formula]

they satisfy d = ∂  +   and are expressed in holomorphic coordinates by

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, one can define the ∂ and [formula] operators from [formula] to [formula] by setting

[formula]

if ω0,1∈T*0,1M and ω1,0∈T*1,0M. In coordinates this is simply

[formula]

There is a natural operator, the Laplacian acting on functions and defined by

[formula]

where d* is the adjoint of d through the metric g and [formula] is the Hodge star operator mapping Λ2 to Λ0 and induced by g as well.

To construct Carleman weights, we will use strongly the Riemann-Roch theorem, so for the convenience of the reader we recall it (see Farkas-Kra [\cite=FK] for more details). A divisor D on M is an element

[formula]

which will also be denoted [formula] or [formula] where α(p) = 0 for all p except α(pi) = ni. The inverse divisor of D is defined to be [formula] and the degree of the divisor D is defined by [formula]. A meromorphic function on M is said to have divisor D if [formula] is equal to D, where ord(p) denotes the order of p as a pole or zero of f (with positive sign convention for zeros). Notice that in this case we have deg (f) = 0. For divisors [formula] and [formula], we say that D'  ≥  D if α'(p)  ≥  α(p) for all p∈M. The same exact notions apply for meromorphic 1-forms on M. Then we define for a divisor D

[formula]

The Riemann-Roch theorem states the following identity: for all divisor D on the closed Riemann surface M of genus g,

[formula]

Notice also that for any divisor D with deg (D) > 0, one has r(D) = 0 since deg (f) = 0 for all f meromorphic. By [\cite=FK], let D be a divisor, then for any non-zero meromorphic 1-form ω on M, one has

[formula]

which is thus independent of ω.

Morse holomorphic functions with prescribed critical points

The main result of this section is the following

Let q be a point in [formula] and let [formula] be an open subset with smooth boundary of the punctured Riemann surface [formula] such that M0  ⊂  . Then there exists a dense set of points p in [formula] such that there exists a Morse holomorphic function f on [formula] which has a critical point at p.

We first prove an auxiliary result which states that for any point [formula] one can find a holomorphic function on [formula], meromorphic on M and with a pole or zero of any desired order at p.

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then there exist meromorphic functions hn,kn on M such that kn is holomorphic on [formula] with a pole of order n at p and hn is holomorphic on [formula] with a zero of order n at p.

Proof. First we claim that there exists [formula] so that for all N  ≥  N0, there is meromorphic function on M, holomorphic on [formula] with a pole of order N at p. Indeed, fix a meromorphic 1-form ω, then by [\eqref=riemannroch], we know that for D: = pN with N > g - 1, then r(D- 1) > 0. Moreover, if deg (D(ω- 1)) > 0, one has r(D(ω)- 1) = 0 so we conclude by [\eqref=abelian] and [\eqref=riemannroch] that if N0 > g - 1 is taken large enough and N  ≥  N0 then r(D- 1) = N - g + 1, which implies that there is a meromorphic function fN with a pole of order N at p and no other poles. By Riemann-Roch again [\eqref=riemannroch], one has r(D- 1) > 0 if [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. Thus there exists a meromorphic function h on M, holomorphic on [formula], with a pole of order, say k'  ≤  k, at q and a zero of order, say [formula] at p. By possibly taking powers of h, we may assume that p is a zero of h of order say N with N > N0. Then the function hn: = (fN - 1h)n is meromorphic on M, holomorphic on [formula], and with a zero of order n at p. Similarly, the function kn: = (hN - 1fN)n is meromorphic on M, holomorphic on [formula] and with a pole of order n at p.[formula]

Fix k > 2 a large integer, we denote by Ck() the Banach space of Ck real valued functions on [formula]. Then the set of harmonic functions on [formula] which are in the Banach space Ck() (and smooth in [formula] by elliptic regularity) is the kernel of the continuous map Δ:Ck()  →  Ck - 2(), and so it is a Banach subspace of Ck(). The set Ck() of harmonic function u in Ck() such there exists v∈Ck() harmonic with u + iv holomorphic on [formula] is a Banach subspace of Ck() of finite codimension. Indeed, let {γ1,..,γN} be a homology basis for [formula], then

[formula]

We now show

The set of functions u∈ which are Morse in [formula] is dense in [formula] with respect to the Ck() topology.

Proof. We use an argument very similar to those used by Uhlenbeck [\cite=Uh]. We start by defining m:  ×  T* by (p,u)  ↦  (p,du(p))∈T*p. This is clearly a smooth map, linear in the second variable, moreover mu: = m(.,u) = (  ·  ,du(  ·  )) is Fredholm since [formula] is finite dimensional. The map u is a Morse functions if and only if mu is transverse to the zero section, denoted T*0, of T*, ie. if

[formula]

which is equivalent to the fact that the Hessian of u at critical points is non-degenerate (see for instance Lemma 2.8 of [\cite=Uh]). We recall the following transversality theorem ([\cite=Uh] or [\cite=Ab] [\cite=Qu]):

Let m:X  ×  W be a Ck map, where X, [formula], and W are separable Banach manifolds with W and X of finite dimension. Let W'  ⊂  W be a submanifold such that k >  max (1, dim X -  dim V +  dim V'). If m is transverse to W' then the set {u∈muW'} is dense in [formula], more precisely it is a set of second category.

We want to apply it with X: = , W: = T* and W': = T*0, and the map m is defined above. We have thus proved our Lemma if one can show that m is transverse to W'. Let (p,u) such that m(p,u) = (p,0)∈V'. Then identifying T(p,0)(T* with TpT*p, one has

[formula]

where Hesspu is the Hessian of u at the point p, viewed as a linear map from Tp to T*p. To prove that m is transverse to W' we need to show that (z,v)  →  (z,dv(p) + Hessp(u)z) is onto from Tp to TpT*p, which is realized for instance if the map v  →  dv(p) from [formula] to T*p is onto. But from Lemma [\ref=poleszeros], we know that there exists a holomorphic function v on [formula] (thus on [formula]) such that v(p) = 0 and [formula] as a linear map [formula], we can then take its real and imaginary parts v1 and v2, both are real valued harmonic smooth function on [formula] thus in [formula], and dv1(p) and dv2(p) are linearly independent in T*p by the Cauchy-Riemann equation v = 0. This shows our claim and ends the proof by using Theorem [\ref=transversality].[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=criticalpoints] Let p be a point of [formula] and let u be a holomorphic function with a nondegenerate critical point at p, the existence is insured by Lemma [\ref=poleszeros]. By Lemma [\ref=morsedense], there exist Morse holomorphic functions [formula] such that uj  →  u in [formula] for any fixed k large. Let ε > 0 small and let U  ⊂   be a neighbourhood containing p and no other critical points of u, and with boundary a smooth circle of radius ε. In complex local coordinates near p, we can consider ∂u and ∂uj as holomorphic functions on an open set of [formula]. Then by Rouche's theorem, it is clear that ∂ has precisely one zero in U if j is large enough. This completes the proof.[formula]

Inverse scattering

We first obtain, as a trivial consequence of Theorem [\ref=identif], a result about inverse scattering for asymptotically hyperbolic surface.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=coroAH]. Let x be a smooth boundary defining function of ∂X̄, and let  = x2g be the compactified metric and define j: = Vj / x2∈C∞(X̄). By conformal invariance of the Laplacian in dimension 2, one has

[formula]

and so if ker L2(Δg + V1) =  ker L2(Δg + V2) and 1  =  2, then the Cauchy data space

[formula]

for the operators [formula] are obviously the same. Then it suffices to apply the result in Theorem [\ref=identif]. [formula]

Now we consider the asymptotically Euclidean scattering at 0 frequency. Recall that an asymptotically Euclidean surface (X,g) has a smooth compactification X̄ with g of the form

[formula]

near the boundary ∂X̄, where x is a smooth boundary defining function and h(t) a smooth family of metrics on the slice {x = t}≃∂X̄ down to {x = 0}  =  ∂X̄ and such that h(0) = dθ2S1 is the metric with length 2π on each of the, say L, copies of S1 composing the boundary. In particular it is conformal to an asymptotically cylindrical metric, or 'b-metric' in the sense of Melrose [\cite=APS],

[formula]

and the Laplacian satisfies Δg = x2Δgb. Each end of X is of the form (0,ε)x  ×  S1θ and the operator Δgb has the expression in the ends

[formula]

for some smooth differential operator P(x,θ;x∂x,∂θ) in the vector fields x∂x,∂θ down to x = 0. Let us define Vb: = x- 2V, which is compactly supported and

[formula]

We also define the following spaces for [formula]

[formula]

Since the eigenvalues of ΔS1 are [formula], the relative Index theorem of Melrose [\cite=APS] shows that Δgb + Vb is Fredholm from xαH2b to xαH0b if [formula]. Moreover, from subsection 2.2.4 of [\cite=APS], we have that any solution of (Δgb + Vb)u = 0 in xαH2b has an asymptotic expansion of the form

[formula]

for some sequence [formula] of non negative integers and some smooth function [formula] on S1. In particular, it is easy to check that ker L2(X,dvolg)(Δg + V) = F1 + ε for ε∈(0,1).

Let (X,g) be an asymptotically Euclidean surface and V1,V2 be two compactly supported smooth potentials and x be a boundary defining function. Let ε∈(0,1) and assume that for any [formula] and any function ψ∈ ker xj - εH2b(Δg + V1) there is a φ∈ ker xj - εH2b(Δg + V2) such that ψ  -  φ = O(x∞), and conversely. Then V1 = V2.

Proof. The idea is to reduce the problem to the compact case. First we notice that by unique continuation, ψ  =  φ where V1 = V2 = 0. Now it remains to prove that, if Rη denote the restriction of smooth functions on X to {x  ≥  η} and V is a smooth compactly supported potential in {x  ≥  η}, then the set [formula] is dense in the set NV of H2({x  ≥  η}) solutions of (Δg + V)u = 0. The proof is well known for positive frequency scattering (see for instance Lemma 3.2 in [\cite=Mel]), here it is very similar so we do not give much details. The main argument is to show that it converges in L2 sense and then use elliptic regularity; the L2 convergence can be shows as follows: let f∈NV such that

[formula]

then we want to show that f = 0. By Proposition 5.64 in [\cite=APS], there exists [formula] and a generalized right inverse Gb for Pb  =  Δgb + Vb (here, as before, x2Vb = V) in x- k - εH2b, such that PbGb  =  Id. This holds in x- k - εH2b for k large enough since the cokernel of Pb on this space becomes 0 for k large. Let ω = Gbf so that (Δgb + Vb)ω = f, and in particular this function is 0 in {x < η}. The asymptotic behaviour of the integral kernel Gb(z,z') of Gb as z  →    ∞   is given in Proposition 5.64 of [\cite=APS] uniformly in z'∈{x  ≥  η}, we have for all [formula] and using the radial coordinates (x,θ)∈(0,ε)  ×  S1 for z in the ends

[formula]

for some functions [formula] and some sequence [formula] of non-negative integers. But the fact that (Δgb + Vb)Gb(z,z') = δ(z - z') as distributions implies directly that (Δgb + Vb)ψj(θ,.) = 0. Using our assumption on f, we deduce that [formula] for all [formula] and so the function ω vanish faster than all power of x at infinity. Then by unique continuation, we deduce that ω = 0 in {x  ≤  ε}. Since now ω∈H2, its Cauchy data at x = η are 0 and Δgb + Vb is self adjoint for the measure dvolgb, we can use the Green formula to obtain

[formula]

The H2 density is easy using elliptic regularity.[formula]
