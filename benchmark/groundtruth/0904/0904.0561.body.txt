Introduction

=1 A lot of summation and transformation formulae for basic hypergeometric series have been found to date. The BC1-type Jackson integral, which is the main subject of interest in this paper, is a q-series which can be written as a basic hypergeometric series in a class of so called very-well-poised-balanced [formula]. A key reason to consider the BC1-type Jackson integrals is to give an explanation of these hypergeometric series from the view points of the Weyl group symmetry and the q-difference equations of the BC1-type Jackson integrals. In [\cite=IS], we showed that Slater's transformation formula for a very-well-poised-balanced [formula] series can be regarded as a connection formula for the solutions of q-difference equations of the BC1-type Jackson integral, i.e., the Jackson integral as a general solution of q-difference system is written as a linear combination of particular solutions. As a consequence we gave a simple proof of Slater's transformation formula. (See [\cite=IS] for details. Also see [\cite=Ito9] for a connection formula for the BCn-type Jackson integral, which is a multisum generalization of that of type BC1.)

The aim of this paper is to present an explicit form of the q-difference system as first order simultaneous q-difference equations for the BC1-type Jackson integral with generic condition on the parameters. We give the Gauss decomposition of the coefficient matrix of the system with a concrete basis (see Theorem [\ref=thm:difference]). Each entry of the decomposed matrices is written as a product of binomials and, as a consequence, the determinant of the coefficient matrix is easy to calculate explicitly. As an application we give a simple proof of the product formula for Gustafson's multiple Cn-type sum [\cite=Gu4]. We also present an explicit form of the q-difference system for the BC1-type Jackson integral with a balancing condition on the parameters. We finally give a simple proof of the product formula for the q-integral of Nassrallah-Rahman [\cite=NR] and Gustafson [\cite=Gu3]. A recent work of Rains and Spiridonov [\cite=RS] contains results for the elliptic hypergeometric integral of a similar type to those contained for the BC1-type Jackson integral obtained here.

[formula]-type Jackson integral

Throughout this paper, we assume 0 < q < 1 and denote the q-shifted factorial for all integers N by [formula] and (x)N: = (x;q)∞ / (qNx;q)∞.

Let [formula] be the set of holomorphic functions on the complex multiplicative group [formula]. A function f on [formula] is said to be symmetric or skew-symmetric under the Weyl group action z  →  z- 1 if f satisfies f(z) = f(z- 1) or f(z) =  - f(z- 1), respectively. For [formula] and a function f on [formula], we define the sum over the lattice [formula] which, provided the integral converges, we call the Jackson integral. For an arbitrary positive integer s, we define the function Φ and the skew-symmetric function Δ on [formula] as follows: where am = qαm. For a symmetric function φ on [formula] and a point [formula], we define the following sum over the lattice [formula]:

[formula]

which we call the Jackson integral of type BC1 and is simply denoted by 〈φ,ξ〉. By definition the sum 〈φ,ξ〉 is invariant under the shift ξ  →  qνξ for [formula].

Let Θ(z) be the function on [formula] defined by

[formula]

where θ(z) denotes the function (z)∞(q / z)∞, which satisfies For a symmetric function [formula], we denote the function 〈φ,z〉  /  Θ(z) by 〈 〈φ,z〉 〉. We call 〈 〈φ,z〉 〉 the regularized Jackson integral of type BC1, which satisfies the following:

Assume [formula]. If [formula] is symmetric, then the function 〈 〈φ,z〉 〉 is symmetric and holomorphic on [formula].

See [\cite=IS].

For an arbitrary meromorphic function φ on [formula] we define the function [formula] on [formula] by

[formula]

In particular, from ([\ref=eq:Phi]), the function Φ(qz) / Φ(z) is the rational function

[formula]

The following proposition will be used for the proof of the key equation (Theorem [\ref=thm:key]):

If [formula] is convergent for [formula], then [formula]

See [\cite=Ito7] for instance.

Key equation

In this section, we will present a key equation to construct the difference equations for the BC1-type Jackson integral. Before we state it, we introduce the function e(x;y) defined by

[formula]

which is expressed by the product form The basic properties of e(x;y) are the following:

As we will see later, equation ([\ref=eq:e-3]) is ignorable in the case [formula], while equation ([\ref=eq:e-1]) is ignorable in the case [formula].

For functions f, g on [formula], the function fg on [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Set ei(z): = e(z;ai) and [formula]. The symbol [formula] is equal to [formula]. The key equation is the following:

Suppose ai  ≠  aj if i  ≠  j. If [formula], then where the coefficients C0 and Cik (1  ≤  k  ≤  s) are given by

Without loss of generality, it suffices to show that where the coefficients C0 and Ci are given by Set [formula] and [formula]. Then, from Lemma [\ref=lem:cohom=0], it follows that Since (F(z) - G(z)) / zs + 1 is skew-symmetric under the reflection z  →  z- 1, it is divisible by z - z- 1, and we can expand it as where the coefficients Ci will be determined below. We obtain [formula] from the principal term of asymptotic behavior of ([\ref=eq:expand(F-G/z)]) as z  →    +    ∞  . If we put z = ai (1  ≤  i  ≤  s), then we have

[formula]

Since F(ai) = 0 and [formula] by definition, the above equation implies ([\ref=eq:key0_c]). From ([\ref=eq:nabla(F/z)]) and ([\ref=eq:expand(F-G/z)]), we obtain ([\ref=eq:key0]), which completes the proof.

The case [formula]

[formula]-difference equation

Set where the hat symbol denotes the term to be omitted.

Let Taj be the difference operator corresponding to the q-shift aj  →  qaj.

Suppose [formula]. For the BC1-type Jackson integrals, if [formula] [formula] and [formula], then the first order vector-valued q-difference equation with respect to the basis [formula] defined by ([\ref=eq:uk]) is given by where B = UL. Here U and L are the s  ×  s matrices defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and for [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:difference]) is rewritten as [formula], where

[formula]

Since Taj〈vi,ξ〉  =  〈ejvi,ξ〉, the above equation is equivalent to and which are to be proved. Equation ([\ref=eq:Uentry0]) is a direct consequence of ([\ref=eq:e-2]) and Theorem [\ref=thm:key] if [formula]. Equation ([\ref=eq:Uentryi]) is trivial using e(z;aj) = e(z;aik) + e(aik;aj) from ([\ref=eq:e-1]). Lastly [formula], which completes the proof.

Since the function Θ(z) satisfies TajΘ(z) =  - ajΘ(z), we immediately have the following from Theorem [\ref=thm:difference]:

Suppose [formula]. For the regularized BC1-type Jackson integrals, if [formula] and [formula], then the first order vector-valued q-difference equation with respect to the basis [formula] is given by where

[formula]

and ci and di are given by ([\ref=eq:cd]). In particular, the diagonal entries of the upper triangular part are written as

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover,

The q-difference system for the BCn-type Jackson integral is discussed in [\cite=AI2] for its rank, and in [\cite=AI3] [\cite=AI4] for the explicit expression of the determinant of the coefficient matrix of the system. On the other hand, though it is only for the BC1-type Jackson integral, the coefficient matrix in its Gauss decomposition form is obtained explicitly only in the present paper.

Application

The aim of this subsection is to give a simple proof of Gustafson's multiple Cn-type summation formula (Corollary [\ref=cor:Gus]). The point of the proof is to obtain a recurrence relation of Gustafson's multiple series of Cn-type. Before we state the recurrence relation, we first give the definition of the multiple series of Cn-type [formula].

For [formula], we set where qαm = am. For an arbitrary [formula], we define the q-shift ξ  →  qνξ by a lattice point [formula], where [formula]. For [formula] we define the sum over the lattice [formula] by which we call the BCn-type Jackson integral. Moreover we set [formula], where By definition, it can be confirmed that [formula] is holomorphic on [formula] (see [\cite=AI3]), and we call it the regularized BCn-type Jackson integral. In particular, if we assume s = n we call [formula] the regularized Jackson integral of Gustafson's Cn-type, which is, in particular, a constant not depending on [formula].

For further results on BCn-type Jackson integrals, see [\cite=AI1] [\cite=AI3] [\cite=AI2] [\cite=AI4] [\cite=Ito9] [\cite=IO], for instance.

Now we state the recurrence relation for Gustafson's sum [formula].

Suppose s = n and [formula]. The sum [formula] satisfies

[formula]

We assume s = n for the basis [formula] of the BC1-type Jackson integral. Let P be the transition matrix from the basis [formula] to [formula]:

[formula]

where χ(i) is the irreducible character of type C1 defined by From ([\ref=eq:eqBbar]) it follows that so that for [formula]. By definition, the relation between the determinant of the BC1-type Jackson integrals and the Jackson integral of Gustafson's Cn-type itself is given as which is also referred to in [\cite=IO]. From ([\ref=eq:TdetBbar]) and ([\ref=eq:<<BC1-BCn>>]), we obtain [formula], where det  has already been given in ([\ref=eq:detBbar]).

The explicit form of the coefficient matrix of the system ([\ref=eq:PBbar/P]) is given in [\cite=A1] or [\cite=AI2].

Suppose s = n and [formula]. Then the sum [formula] is written as

[formula]

By repeated use of the recurrence relation in Proposition [\ref=prop:recGus1], using the asymptotic behavior of the Jackson integral as the boundary condition of the recurrence relation, we eventually obtain Corollary [\ref=cor:Gus]. See [\cite=Ito8] for further details about the proof.

From ([\ref=eq:<<BC1-BCn>>]) and Corollary [\ref=cor:Gus], we see which is non-degenerate under generic condition. This indicates that the set [formula], χ(0)} is linearly independent. And we eventually know the rank of the q-difference system with respect to this basis is s, so are the ranks of the systems ([\ref=eq:difference]) and ([\ref=eq:eqBbar]).

The case [formula]

Reflection equation

Suppose [formula]. Let vk(z), [formula], be the functions defined by ([\ref=eq:uk]) for the fixed indices [formula] If [formula], then

[formula]

where M = Mj2NM- 1j1. Here Mj and N are the matrices defined by

[formula]

where the entries of the above matrices are given by Moreover,

First we will prove the following: which are equivalent to and Under the condition [formula], Equation ([\ref=eq:Mentry0]) is a direct consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:key]. Equation ([\ref=eq:Mentryi]) is trivial from the equation

[formula]

which was given in ([\ref=eq:e-3]). From ([\ref=eq:MN1]) and ([\ref=eq:MN2]), it follows M = Mj2NM- 1j1. Moreover, we obtain

[formula]

which completes the proof.

Suppose s = 2 and the condition [formula]. The recurrence relation for the BC1-type Jackson integral 〈1,ξ〉 is

[formula]

Without loss of generality, it suffices to show that Set J(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6;ξ): = 〈1,ξ〉. Under the condition a1a2a3a4a5a6 = 1, we have

[formula]

from Theorem [\ref=thm:ref-eqn] by setting j1 = 1 and j2 = 6. We now replace a6 by q- 1a6 in the above equation. Then, under the condition a1a2a3a4a5(q- 1a6) = 1, we have

[formula]

Since Ta1〈1,ξ〉 = J(qa1,a2,a3,a4,a5,q- 1a6;ξ) under this condition a6 = q(a1a2a3a4a5)- 1, we obtain ([\ref=eq:Ta1<1] [\ref=xi>]), which completes the proof.

Suppose s = n + 1 and the condition [formula]. Then the recurrence relation for Gustafson's sum [formula] where [formula] is given by

[formula]

Fix s = n + 1. For the BC1-type Jackson integral, we first set

[formula]

where χ(i) is defined in ([\ref=eq:chi]), under no condition on [formula]. By the definition of Φ, we have

[formula]

Let Q be the transition matrix from the basis [formula] to [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

Under the condition [formula], from Theorem [\ref=thm:ref-eqn] with j1 = 1 and j2 = 2n + 4, it follows that

[formula]

so that

[formula]

This indicates that

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:detM]) and the above equation we have

[formula]

under the condition [formula]. We now replace a2n + 4 by q- 1a2n + 4 in the above equation. Then we have

[formula]

under the condition [formula]. Since

[formula]

if [formula], we have

[formula]

On the other hand, if [formula], then, by definition we have which is also referred to in [\cite=IO]. Therefore, under the condition [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Since the same argument holds for parameters [formula], we can conclude Corollary [\ref=cor:s=n+1Taj].

If we take ξ = ai, [formula], and add the terminating condition a1a2 = q- N, [formula] to the assumptions of Corollary [\ref=cor:s=2Taj], then the finite product expression of 〈1,ξ〉, which is equivalent to Jackson's formula for terminating [formula] series [\cite=GR], is obtained from finite repeated use of Corollary [\ref=cor:s=2Taj]. In the same way, if we take a suitable x and add the terminating condition to the assumptions of Corollary [\ref=cor:s=n+1Taj], then the finite product expression of [formula], which is equivalent to the Jackson type formula for terminating multiple [formula] series (see [\cite=DG] or [\cite=DS], for instance), is obtained from finite repeated use of Corollary [\ref=cor:s=n+1Taj].

Application

The aim of this subsection is to give a simple proof of the following propositions proved by Nassrallah and Rahman [\cite=NR] and Gustafson [\cite=Gu3].

Assume |ai| < 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  5. If [formula], then where [formula] is the unit circle taken in the positive direction.

We denote the left-hand side of ([\ref=eq:NR]) by I(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5). By residue calculation, where

[formula]

whose recurrence relation is for 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  5, which is obtained using ([\ref=eq:thProperty]). From ([\ref=eq:Res2]), ([\ref=eq:TRk]) and Corollary [\ref=cor:s=2Taj], we obtain the recurrence relation for I(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5) as

[formula]

By repeated use of the above relation, we obtain and

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Strictly speaking, the residue calculation ([\ref=eq:Res1]) requires that which can be shown in the following way. We first take ε = qNε' for ε' > 0 and positive integer N. If we put

[formula]

then we have F(z) = zG1(z)G2(z), where

[formula]

Since G1(z) is a continuous function on the compact set |z| = ε' and is invariant under the q-shift z  →  qz under the condition a6 = q(a1a2a3a4a5)- 1, |G1(z)| is bounded on |z| = qNε'. |G2(z)| is also bounded because G2(z)  →  1 if z  →  0. Thus there exists C > 0 such that |F(z)| < C|z|. If we put [formula], then

[formula]

which proves ([\ref=eq:to0]).

Assume |ai| < 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  2n + 3. If [formula], then where [formula] is the n-fold direct product of the unit circle traversed in the positive direction.

The proof below is based on an idea using residue computation due to Gustafson [\cite=Gu4], which is done for the case of the hypergeometric integral under no balancing condition. Here we will show that his residue method is still effective even for the integral under the balancing condition [formula]. In particular, this is different from his proof in [\cite=Gu3].

Let L be the set of indices defined by

[formula]

Set [formula] for [formula]. We denote the left-hand side of ([\ref=eq:NR-G]) by [formula]. By residue calculation, we have where the coefficients Rμ, μ∈L, are

[formula]

The recurrence relation for Rμ is From ([\ref=eq:Res]), ([\ref=eq:TRmu]) and Corollary [\ref=cor:s=n+1Taj], we obtain the recurrence relation for [formula] as

[formula]

By repeated use of the above relation, we obtain and This completes the proof.
