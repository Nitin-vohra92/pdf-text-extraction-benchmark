The Analytical Solution of the Lag-Lead Compensator

Introduction

The well known lag-lead compensator design problem is a typical frequency controller design problem; see also the related discussions in the textbooks listed in [\cite=DavisonChenPloenBernstein2007]. During the last four decades, different design methods were proposed [\cite=Wakeland1974]-[\cite=Wang2006]. The analytical design procedures for single continuous phase-lag and phase-lead compensator have been given in several literatures, e.g. [\cite=Wang2003]. An analytical solving procedure is constructed for three-parameter lag-lead compensators in [\cite=Wang2006]. But that method cannot be directly applied to four-parameter cases. A universal design chart based four-parameter lag-lead compensator design method was proposed in [\cite=YeungLee2000]. Though it makes great progress to avoid manual graphical manipulations in design, it is still a graph based approach and sometimes does not yield the accurate solution. To our best knowledge, the analytical solution of four-parameter or even more general lag-lead compensator remains unsolved till now.

In this paper, we will first give the analytical solution of the general lag-lead compensator. Then, we will show why a series of more than 5 phase-lead/phase-lag compensator usually cannot be analytically determined using the Galois Theory.

The Analytical Solution for the General Lag-Lead Compensator

In general, a nth-order lag-lead compensator (n  ≥  1) can be written as

[formula]

where ai, [formula], for i = 1, ..., n, due to the requirement of casual stability.

Substitute s with jω, we get

[formula]

Usually, the dedicated performance requirements are given as several pairs of gain and phase at certain frequencies. For the kth performance requirement, we have

[formula]

where gk and pk are the corresponding gain and phase at frequency ωk, for [formula].

Eq.([\ref=equ:3]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

I) If n is an even integer satisfying n  =  2m, [formula]. From Eq.([\ref=equ:4]), we can have

[formula]

which finally leads to the following two linear equations of ai, bi, for i = 1, ..., n.

[formula]

[formula]

II) Similarly, if n is an odd integer satisfying n  =  2m - 1, [formula], the kth performance requirement will also lead to two linear equations of ai, bi, for i = 1, ..., n.

In the rest of this paper, we will call r performance requirement pairs (gk, pk, ωk), k = 1, ..., r are feasible, if they lead to a 2r consistent and linearly independent (irreducible) equation set defined as ([\ref=equ:6])-([\ref=equ:7]). As a result, we can reach the following conclusion.

Suppose we have r feasible performance requirement pairs (gk, pk, ωk), k = 1, ..., r. If r  <  n, we may have infinite possible solutions of this compensator. If r  >  n, we cannot find a feasible solution of this compensator. If r  =  n, we can formulate a 2n consistent and linearly independent linear equation set for these 2n unknown parameters ai, bi, for i = 1, ..., n. Thus, we can get the analytical solution of this lag-lead compensator directly by solving this linear equations set (e.g. using Cramer's rule).

It is easy to prove that the analytical solving methods of phase-lag/phase-lead and three-parameter lag-lead compensator design problem proposed in [\cite=Wang2003]-[\cite=Wang2006] are indeed special cases of the above method.

Further Discussions

There are two interesting questions concerning the lag-lead compensator design problems. The first question is

Question 1: Determine whether a set of performance requirement pairs (gk, pk, ωk), k = 1, ..., n is feasible for a nth-order lag-lead compensator.

From the above discussion, we can see that a set of n performance requirement pairs is feasible unless they lead to 2n consistent and linearly independent. Moreover, it is often required the lag-lead compensator to be casual stable. Thus, we need to check the algebraic stability criterion for the following equation

[formula]

after obtaining ai, i = 1, ..., n.

The necessary and sufficient algebra stability criterion for Eq.([formula]) is hard to find. However, we can apply Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion which is necessary and frequently sufficient. Since readers are familiar with this issue, we will not discuss the details.

The second question is

Question 2: Determine whether we find a series of n phase-lead/phase-lag compensator connected as

[formula]

which can satisfy a set of performance requirement pairs (gk, pk, ωk), k = 1, ..., n. Here, ci, [formula], for i = 1, ..., n.

From the above discussion, if this set of performance requirement pairs (gk, pk, ωk), k = 1, ..., n, is feasible, we have

[formula]

where ai, bi, i = 1, ..., n are calculated from the selected performance requirements using the above method.

Thus, Question 2 is equal to finding the roots of sn  +  a1sn - 1  +  ...  +  an  =  0 and sn  +  b1sn - 1  +  ...  +  bn  =  0.

Based on the well known Galois theory [\cite=Lang2002]-[\cite=Stewart2003], we can always find the the analytical solution of ci, di, i = 1, ..., n for n∈{1,2,3,4}. But generally, we cannot find the analytical solution for n  ≥  5.
