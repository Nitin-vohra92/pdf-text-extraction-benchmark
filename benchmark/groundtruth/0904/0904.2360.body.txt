A Dual Four Dimensional Superstring

Introduction

Nambu[\citet=key-1] and Goto[\citet=key-2] proposed a classical relativistic string theory which turned out to be valid only in 26 dimensions. It was raised to the quantum level by Goddard, Rebbi, Thorn[\citet=key-3], Goldstone[\citet=key-4] and Mandelstam [\citet=key-5]. The suggestion of Scherk and Schwarz[\citet=key-6] [\citet=key-7] that the string theory carries the quantum numbers for all the four fundamental interactions including gravity did not make much progress till 1984. Then Green and Schwarz[\citet=key-8] formulated the superstring theory in ten dimensions. The heterotic string theory of Gross, Harvey, Martinec and Rohm[\citet=key-9] was found to be the first candidate to explain the physical interactions. Casher, Englert, Nicolai and Taormina[\citet=key-10] have proposed that a 26 dimensional bosonic string contains the ten dimensional superstring, the two N = 1 superstrings and the two N = 2 superstrings. However, it has been a long standing problem to come down satisfactorily to the four dimensional physical world. Kaku[\citet=key11] and Green, Schwarz and Witten[\citet=key-12], in their books, have rightly spelt out that 'No one really knows how to break the ten dimensional theory down to four'.

The simplest way appears to be to descend directly from the 26-dimensional bosonic string to the 4-dimensional superstring by using the Mandelstam equivalence between fermions and bosons in an anomaly free string theory. The bosons are four in nature. The fermions belong to SO(3,1) bosonic representation and are divided into two groups. One group has 24 neutrino-like spinors placed right handedly in six ways and the other 20 of the similar spinors are placed left handedly in five ways. Thus the total number of fermions is [formula] and [formula], which have opposite handedness. The total number of bosons is equal to four. These can be taken as the basic objects for constructing a four dimensional string theory.

One of the present authors(BBD) has shown, in 2003, how to construct a correct superstring in four dimensions[\citet=key-13] from the original 26 dimensional theory. This formulation has been used to find[\citet=key-14] [\citet=key-15] [\citet=key-16] most of the properties which would be found by using the ten dimensional superstrings. There are, of course, many interesting aspects of physics which cannot be directly found by this method. It was seen[\citet=key-17] [\citet=key-18] that the equations of motion derived from the low energy effective action in four dimensional string theory are invariant under the electric-magnetic duality transformation[\citet=key-19] that interchanges the electric and magnetic fields, and at the same time interchanges the strong and weak coupling limits. This will be pursued further in four dimensional theory.

This theory has the correct dimensionality of 26 and in the second of these, one expects 52 'dimensions' for the 52 types of fields and field components. Everywhere the ordinary physical dimensions will be four. There will be sixteen such and four more will be like connecting factors.

This four dimensional string theory is used successfully in black hole physics to modify the Reissner-Nordstrom metric for a charged black hole[\citet=key-20] and derive the Bekenstein-Hawking relation between entropy and area of a black hole. This is achieved by the introduction of an additional term, arising from strong interaction, into the Reissner-Nordstrom metric for a charged black hole which gives the area of the event horizon of the black hole. For calculation of the entropy of the black hole, we use the present four dimensional string theory.

A review of the four dimensional superstring theory will be given in section-2. In sections-3 and 4, the duality invariant action, coupling to gravity and generalisation to string theory will be discussed. In section-5, the equivalence between the two methods will be shown. In section-6, the metric tensor for a black hole will be obtained and in section-7, the entropy-area relation for a black hole will be derived. Section-8 will be devoted to conclusion.

Four dimensional superstring

We begin with an outline of the method of 4-dimensional string theory used by us. The Nambu-Goto[\citet=key-1] [\citet=key-2] bosonic string theory, in the world sheet [formula] in 26 dimensions, has the action

[formula]

where [formula]. Using Mandelstam's proof of the equivalence between one boson to two fermions, in the infinite volume limit in 1 + 1 dimensional field theory, one can write this action as the sum of the action for four bosonic coordinates Xμ and the action for 44 fermions having SO(44) symmetry. This is true in finite intervals and circles, as has beeen shown by Mandelstam[\citet=key-5]. The Majorana fermions can be in the bosonic representation of the Lorentz group SO(3,1). The 44 fermions form 11 Lorentz vectors. The action can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The Dirac operators ρα∂α are real since ρα are imaginary.

The action given in equation([\ref=eq:2]) is not supersymmetric. In order to get a supersymmetric action, the eleven ψμ,  j are divided into two species: the six ψμ,  j with [formula], 6 and the five φμ,k   with [formula]. For the first group of six [formula] whereas for the second group of five we have φμ,k  =  φ( + )μ,k  -  φ( - )μ,k. Thus they differ in their 'neutrino-like' phase. All these are Majorana fermions. There are [formula] 'neutrinos' of one type and [formula] of the other type. This is indeed possible for the 'neutrinos'. The action can now be written as

[formula]

which is invariant under SO(6)  ×  SO(5) as well as SO(3,1). The action is now supersymmetric and is invariant under the supersymmetric transformations

[formula]

Here ε is a constant anticommuting spinor. The ej are arrays of 11 numbers with ten zeros and only one '1' in the jth place. The ek are arrays of 11 numbers with ten zeros and only one '- 1' in the kth place. They satisfy the relations ejej = 6 and ekek = 5. The commutator of two supersymmetric transformations gives a world sheet transformation. It is to be noted that [formula] is the superpartner of Xμ. The details can be found in the references [\citet=key-13] [\citet=key-14] [\citet=key-15] [\citet=key-16]. The importance of the 'six' ψμj and the 'five' φμk will be revealed while deriving the expression for the entropy of a black hole in section-7.

The field Xμ can be expressed in terms of the complex coordinates z = σ + iτ and   =  σ - iτ as

[formula]

Further,

[formula]

and

[formula]

By varying the field and the zweibein, it is seen that the Noether current Jα and the energy momentum tensor Tαβ vanish i.e.,

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the light cone coordinates, these become

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula].

The super Virasoro generators of energy momenta Lm and the currents Gr,  Fm are given by

[formula]

The normal ordering constant is equal to one.

The physical states |φ〉 satisfy the conditions

[formula]

[formula]

So, with |ψ〉 = |ψ+〉 + |ψ-〉, one has

[formula]

These conditions make the string ghost free.

The mass spectrum of the model, from the Hamiltonian L0 , is given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is the Regge slope.

The GSO projection eliminates the half integral values and the mass spectrum is obtained as as [formula] .

There are, in all, [formula] 'coordinate like' valued objects. They are the [formula] α's because these are 'photon-like', the [formula] b or d, and the [formula] [formula] or [formula]. So in all there are exactly twice the number of 'objects' in the theory.

The super-Virasora generators described in reference[\citet=key-16] elucidate the method we are following herein.

Before proceeding further, we give a brief account of the preliminaries of the classical electric and magnetic fields as outlined by Schwarz and Sen[\citet=key-19].

Duality invariant action and coupling to gravity

Let us introduce independent gauge fields for the electromagnetic field and its dual, A(α)μ, μ= 0,1,2,3;       α = 1,2. In flat space time the action is

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Further,

[formula]

The action given in equation([\ref=eq:16]) is invariant under the gauge transformation

[formula]

where Ψ(α) and Λ(α) are the gauge transformation parameters. We can set

[formula]

by using the gauge transformation parameter Ψ(α). By this choice, we do not lose any equations of motion since A(α)0 occurs only as part of a total derivative in the action. The equation of motion for the field A(2)i is

[formula]

This does not involve any time derivative of A(2)i. So, A(2)i can be treated as an auxilary field and be eliminated from the action([\ref=eq:16]). In order to achieve this we write, from equation([\ref=eq:21]),

[formula]

for some φ. The φ in equation([\ref=eq:22]) can be set to zero by using the freedom associated with the gauge parameter Λ(1). So, we get

[formula]

Putting this in equation([\ref=eq:16]) we get the usual Maxwell action for the field A(1)μ,

[formula]

in the gauge A(1)0 = 0. The duality transformation [formula] and [formula] are manifest and persist in the ongoing process.

In order to incorporate gravity, the action([\ref=eq:16]) is generalised to curved space time in such a way that the A(2)μ are eliminated by using their equations of motion and the Maxwell's equations. In curved space time, the field A(1)μ is obtained from the action

[formula]

where

[formula]

The string theory action

Generalisation of the duality invariant action to string theory has been made mostly by Schwarz, Sen and Maharana[\citet=key-17] [\citet=key-18] [\citet=key-19]. Their results, which are specific to our purpose, are summarised below.

The low energy effective action is[\citet=key-19],

[formula]

where [formula] are a set of 12 abelian gauge fields and

[formula]

Further,

[formula]

is a complex scalar field, which is like a scalar dilaton field. The matrix L is given by

[formula]

and M is a [formula] matrix valued scalar field satisfying the constraints

[formula]

The matrix M can be parametrised as

[formula]

where Ĝ are [formula] symmetric matrices and B̂ are [formula] antisymmetric matrices. We also have

[formula]

with [formula]. The equations of motion obtained from the action([\ref=eq:27]) have a further SL(2,R) symmetry

[formula]

If we choose [formula] d = 0, the transformations([\ref=eq:34]) take the form

[formula]

With the choice λ1 = 0, the transformation([\ref=eq:35]) takes the electric field to magnetic field and vice versa. It also takes [formula]. Since [formula] can be identified with the coupling constant of the string theory, the duality transformation([\ref=eq:35]) takes a strong coupling theory to a weak coupling theory and vice versa. Thus, equation([\ref=eq:35]) contains the strong-weak coupling duality transformation as well as the electric-magnetic duality transformation.

The action([\ref=eq:27]) has manifest invariance under SL(2,R) and global coordinate transformation, but O(6,6) is only a symmetry of the equations of motion.

The Ricci tensor Rμν and other relations are obtained as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and finally

[formula]

is given by the Bianchi identities satisfied by the F(a)μν. Here Dμ denotes the standard covariant derivative.

When the field A(2)μ is eliminated by using its equation of motion, we get a part of the action as

[formula]

This is the gauge field dependent part of the action([\ref=eq:27]) in flat background. The gauge field A(2)μ will be identified with the dual vector potential, introduced by Kallosh and Ortin[\citet=key-21].

For M = I,  L = I, there are precisely 22 copies of this action along with the four copies due to the λ's. It may be pointed out again that

[formula]

Equivalence of the two methods

The string states and quantum operators:

We give a brief accounrt of the correspondence between the string states and quantum operators. It is known that the Neveu-Schwarz bosonic sector, in the bosonic superstring, contains a bosonic tachyon. The ground state of zero mass can be constructed conveniently by using this tachyon state. The vacuum state |0,0〉 of the string is the functional integral of the string theory over a semi-infinite strip, which can be conformally mapped to the unit circle. The following recipe, provided by Polchinski[\citet=key-22], for the link between superstring states and quantum operators is very useful for quantising our theory.

Radial quantisation has a natural isomorphism between the string state space of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in a periodic spatial dimension and the space of local operators. Let a local isolated operator A be considered at the origin of the unit circle |z| = 1, with no more inside and with no other specification outside the circle. Let us open a slit in the circle and consider the path integral, on the unit circle, giving an inner product 〈ψout|ψin〉. Here, ψin is the incoming state given by the path integral |z|   < 1 and ψout is the outgoing state at |z| > 1. Thus we see that a field φ is decomposed into integrals outside, inside and on the circle. We denote the last one by φB. The outside and inside integrals are denoted by ψout(φB) and ψin(φB) respectively. The remainder is [formula] The incoming state is denoted by | ψA〉 since it depends on the operator A. This gives the required mapping from operators to states. Summarizing," the mapping from operators to states is given by a path integral on the unit disk". The inverse mapping is also true.

For any conserved charge Q, the operator equivalent of  QA is Q|ψA〉. For example, if A is the unit operator [formula], and [formula]  for [formula] so that ∂X is analytic and the integral vanishes for [formula], we get [formula] for [formula] The exact correspondence between the unit operator [formula] and the string vacuum |0,0〉 is thus established.

[formula]

Similarly, the operator equivalence of the state |0,k〉 is given by

[formula]

where X(z) is given by equation([\ref=eq:4a]). The expression :eikX: implies normal ordering of the operators contained in it. In the state |0,k〉, the first symbol refers to the value of m and the second one to the eigenvalue of αμ0, i.e., αμ0|0,k〉 = kμ|0,k〉. So, for the tachyon, |0,k〉  ↔  eikx since |z| = 1 on the circumference of the circle, the tachyonic vacuum cannot annihilate[\citet=key11]. The CFT unitarity gives the normalization

[formula]

For the three spatial components one has

[formula]

This is generalized to the normalization of massless states with [formula], and we use one like the normalization for massive vector meson, i.e.,

[formula]

The equivalence of the two methods:

The equivalence between the two methods is summarised below.

We have [formula] objects whose equations of motion are written down in both the theories, and they are equivalent in the sense that the quantities we wish to determine would be meaningfully the same in both the methods. This implies the following way of expressing the Faμν 's.

They are suitably rearranged in the theory given in section-3. The extra bosons [formula] are computed separately. It should be noted that the mapping from operators to states is given by path integrals on the unit disc as described by Polchinski[\citet=key-22]. The inverse is also true. The tachyonic states become very useful to construct the ground state of zero mass. Thus the correspondence and equivalence between the two methods are easily established. The F(a)μν(x) 's given in equations([\ref=eq:42]) to ([\ref=eq:46]) are equivalent to the 12 fields Faμν 's given in equation([\ref=eq:28]). So our results for these 12 fields are the same as that of the 4 dimensional theory. Further, λ1 and λ2 have the same expressions as used by us previously. One is related to the dilaton field and the other to the basic couplng constant [formula].

It is an important fact to realise that a way has been found out to understand how duality is brought into the picture. We would like to examine how the strong-weak coupling duality or the electric-magnetic duality goes through to the very basis of the string theory. Further, the general theory of relativity has been introduced very conveniently and one can proceed to study the gravitational effects more closely and effectively. Inclusion of gravity and the strong-weak coupling duality are the two important attributes of the four dimensional string theory presented here.

The metric tensor for black hole

Here we show how the metric tensor for a charged black hole (the Reissner-Nordstrom metric) gets modified due to the incorporation of strong interaction effects. The metric tensor, in general, is given by

[formula]

with xμ = (t,r,θ,φ) . The spherically symmetric, static metric is written in a convenient form as

[formula]

where μ and ν are functions of r,t . For static, spherically symmetric case, the vanishing of the Ricci tensor R22 = 0 in the field equation shows that both μ and ν are independent of time and depend only on r. Further, from the relation R00 + R11 = 0 for the Ricci tensor, we get μ =  - ν. This leads to the Schwarzschild metric

[formula]

where M is the mass located at the origin.

This metric gets modified for a charged black hole. For a static, spherically symmetric charge distribution with total charge Q, the only non-vanishing component of the field strength tensor is [formula]. So, in the Einstein field equation, instead of R22 = 0, we should have [formula] This gives the usual result[\citet=key-20] for the Ricci tensor

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Thus the metric for a charged black hole,with total charge Q, and mass M is given by the Reissner-Nordstrom metric

[formula]

In addition to this, we should have a contribution from the strong interaction. For higher energy systems like black hole[\citet=key-18], [formula] so that a term containing the factor [formula] is also present in R22.

For a static, constant background field, the field strength tensor is [\citet=key-23]

[formula]

with gauge covariant derivative

[formula]

Here, Cαβγ are the structure constants. From perturbation expansion it is clear that the coefficient of   AαβAβγAγμ is

[formula]

where [formula] is an integer. Here [formula] is the Regge slope . It is assumed that the mass M of the black hole falls on the Regge trajectory or is very close to it. Thus in the presence of both electromagnetic and strong interaction the Ricci tensor R22 is given by

[formula]

The constant [formula], in the above equation, is determined from the condition that the black hole is to be extremal. Equation([\ref=eq:50]) now becomes

[formula]

Due to the inclusion of the effect of strong interaction, the Reissner-Nordstrom metric is now modified and is given by[\citet=key-20]

[formula]

We further simplify this as follows. The cubic equation

[formula]

has three roots r0,  r1 and r2 which satisfy the relations

[formula]

This leads to the solutions

[formula]

If the above roots are to be real, one should have [formula]. In order to calculate the area of the event horizon of the black hole, one must have at least

[formula]

Further, for an extremal black hole one has Q = M so that

[formula]

Thus, for an extremal black hole, the roots r0,  r1 and r2 become

[formula]

Substitution of this in the relation [formula], leads to the value of [formula] as

[formula]

So, the metric of equation([\ref=eq:55a]) now becomes

[formula]

In terms of the solutions [formula] this metric can be recast as

[formula]

where [formula] So, the metric coefficients are

[formula]

The area of the event horizon of the black hole is

[formula]

which, by using equation([\ref=eq:55b]) comes out to be

[formula]

In this case, the horizon is visible[\citet=key-24].

For closed string, we have [formula] instead of [formula] So the area of the event horizon, for closed string, becomes

[formula]

We shall see, in the next section, that the area of the event horizon of the black hole, in string theory, is related to the black hole entropy.

Black hole entropy

In order to calculate the entropy of the black hole, it is necessary to enumerate the physical modes of the string and one has to use the 26 dimensional theory. There are 24 physical bosons in the 26-D Nambu-Goto bosonic string. Since the total normal ordering constant has the value a =  - 1, the normal ordering constant for each boson is equal to [formula]. The total number of open string bosonic states dn can be obtained from the generating function[\citet=key-12]

[formula]

which, in turn, is evaluated from the following.

[formula]

where [formula] is the classical partition function. The number of states dn can be projected out from [formula] by a contour integral along a small circle about the origin,

[formula]

One finds that for n  →    ∞

[formula]

So, in case of open string, the black hole entropy is

[formula]

Fron equations([\ref=eq:57]) and ([\ref=eq:63]) we get the relation between the entropy and area of a black hole as

[formula]

which is the correct Bekenstein-Hawking relation between entropy and area of a black hole.

This result was obtained in 26 dimensions where we have used 26 bosonic coordinates. Now we proceed to evaluate the entropy of black hole using the 4 dimensional superstring theory which has 4 bosonic modes and 4 fermionic modes[\citet=key-20]. The degeneracy dn is obtained from the generating function

[formula]

Asymptotically, i.e., as [formula], we have

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

For a closed string, we have [formula] instead of [formula]. In this case, the level density, again being statistical, is given by

[formula]

The corresponding entropy is

[formula]

From equations([\ref=eq:69]) and ([\ref=eq:58]), we get the entropy-area relation for extremal black hole, for closed string, as

[formula]

This result is exactly the same as that given in equation([\ref=eq:64]) for open string. Thus the equations([\ref=eq:70]) and ([\ref=eq:64]) give the correct Bekenstein-Hawking relation between entropy and area of a black hole.

Conclusion

The extended string theory is thus seen to yield the expected results and should be pursued vigorously. The original pure bosonic string theory can be turned into a superstring. Again, without much ado, we can go over to a four dimensional string theory with gravity. The full consequences of the theory can be realised and we can get the correct metric tensor as well as the entropy-area relation for a charged extremal black hole.

For D = 4, as in this case, there is the SU(1,1) or SL(2,R) symmetry. The 'dilaton' and the 'axion' are present together and magically parametrize the coset space as has been stated by Maharana and Schwarz[\citet=key-17].

We believe that the theory presented here is true to all orders in perturbation theory and not for a limited range, as has been stressed only for the ten dimensional theories. In four dimensions, both the approaches are complimentary and should be taken equally seriously.
