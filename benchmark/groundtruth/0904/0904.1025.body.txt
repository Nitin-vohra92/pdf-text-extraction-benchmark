IS THERE A DARK MATTER SIGNAL IN THE GALACTIC POSITRON ANNIHILATION RADIATION ?

I. Introduction.--The positron annihilation radiation in the 511 keV line and 3-photon positronium continuum from the Galactic bulge has been measured for nearly forty years [\cite=jo72] [\cite=we08] at a line flux of [formula] photons cm- 2 s- 1 and a continuum flux ~   3 times that. This corresponds to a positron annihilation rate in the Galactic bulge of [formula] e+ s- 1. Comparable annihilation radiation has been measured[\cite=we08] from the Galactic disk and halo, which with their calculated[\cite=gu91] [\cite=je06] positron to 511 keV photon ratios give annihilation rates of [formula] e+ s- 1 for each, assuming a Solar distance to the Galactic center of 8 kpc.

The long standing model source[\cite=co70] of these Galactic positrons is the β+-decay of the radionuclei, 56Ni, 44Ti and 26Al, in supernova ejecta and Wolf Rayet winds. They are well defined both theoretically and observationally, and can easily account for the total Galactic positron annihilation rate of [formula] e+ s- 1[\cite=we08] [\cite=je06].

In particular, 56Ni, which decays through 56Co to produce all of the 56Fe in the Galaxy[\cite=ti95], is by far the largest single source of Galactic positrons from β+-decay of 56Co 19% of the time. That yields about [formula] e+ s- 1, roughly 25 times that needed to explain the observed annihilation radiation! Because of the relatively short, ~   111 days, decay mean life of 56Co, most of its ~   0.63 MeV positrons slow down and annihilate deep in the expanding supernova ejecta, where their annihilation radiation is absorbed[\cite=co69]. However, an estimated 5±  2% of positrons are born late enough to survive annihilation in the rarifying ejecta of SNIa, based on both model calculations, and analyses of late-time light curves[\cite=ch93]. SNIa produce roughly half of the Galactic 56Ni[\cite=ti95] with an estimated Galactic rate of 1 SN every 250±  100 yr, based on extragalactic surveys[\cite=va91] and a 56Ni yield of 0.58 M[formula]/SN[\cite=no84], consistent with their "standard candle" luminosity[\cite=le01]. This gives a net Galactic positron production of [formula] e+ s- 1 from the 56Ni decay chain, which accounts for roughly 2/3 of the observed radiation[\cite=we08] [\cite=je06]. This is also quite consistent with 511 keV line flux limits[\cite=ka06] from observations of a SNIa remnant.

The remaining positrons come from much longer lived 44Ti and 26Al β+-decay and essentially all escape from the ejecta. 44Ti decays with an 89 yr mean life through 44Sc to produce essentially all of the 44Ca in the Galaxy, and its production can be directly scaled[\cite=ch93] to that of 56Fe from the measured Solar system 44Ca/56Fe abundance ratio, resulting in [formula] e+ s- 1, or 20% of that observed. Lastly, the β+-decay positrons from 26Al with a [formula] yr decay mean life are determined directly from its Galactic mass of [formula] M[formula], given by its measured[\cite=ma84] Galactic 1.809 MeV decay line emission. Other sources, such as cosmic-ray interactions, novae, pulsars, black holes and gamma-ray bursts, are expected[\cite=ra79] to make only negligible contributions.

The first observations using the spectrometer on the INTEGRAL satellite[\cite=je03] confirmed the earlier 511 keV line flux from the Galactic bulge at [formula] photons cm- 2 s- 1. However, they found that the bulge-to-disk ratio (B/D) of the 511 keV positron annihilation line flux from the bulge relative to that from the disk, exceeded by a factor of 3 or more, the corresponding ratio of positron production distribution, expected from the bulge and disk components of SNIae.

If the annihilating positrons do not diffuse far before they slow down and annihilate, the spatial distribution of their annihilation should be essentially the same as their production. Based on that supposition, the INTEGRAL observers suggested [\cite=we04] that some new bulge source of additional positrons was responsible for the difference in the B/D ratio, although they had not found any actual increase in the total positron annihilation from the bulge, compared to previous measurements[\cite=jo72].

II. Positrons from Dark Matter?--Dark matter (DM) was promptly proposed[\cite=bo04] as the new source of bulge positrons and the supposition of negligible positron propagation was quantified. They suggested that the positrons were formed at energies of 1 to 100 MeV from e+ - e- pair-production in the annihilation of some new light scalar DM particles and antiparticles. Such positrons, like those from β+ decay of radionuclei, must slow down to nearly thermal energies ≤   10 eV, primarily by ionization losses in the interstellar medium (ISM), before they in turn can annihilate to produce the observed 511 keV line emission. This slowing-down or stopping distance, dsd, is around 1024 to 1026 cm for such positrons in interstellar gas of density ~  0.1 H cm- 3. They further assumed[\cite=bo04] that such positrons diffuse through the ISM with a diffusion mean free path, λ  ~  rL, the Larmor radius, of around 109 to 1011 cm in interstellar magnetic fields of a few microgauss. Therefore, the positrons would only travel a mean distance [formula] to [formula] cm, or barely 0.01 to 1 pc, from their sources before they stopped and annihilated.

Thus, they[\cite=bo04] expected the spatial distribution of the positron annihilation to be virtually the same as that of their production. Although the DM density distribution in the bulge is assumed to have a radial power-law form, R-  γ, the exponent is highly uncertain. So, they simply determined a γ of 0.4 to 0.8 from the best-fit Gaussian HWHM ~  4.5+ 4.5- 1.5 deg. of the INTEGRAL angular distribution of the 511 keV line flux[\cite=je03]. They also let the observed 511 keV flux determine an assumed DM-DM* annihilation cross section that could make it consistent with the assumed relic DM density. Then with ~  10 degrees of freedom, they invented a light DM candidate that didn't violate collider limits[\cite=bo04] and might be a new source for the presumed bulge positron "excess".

Based on claims there was no astrophysical explanation, about 150 papers have since been published[\cite=bo09], envisioning a whole zoo of new DM candidates to explain the bulge "excess." These include new axinos, supermassive strangelets, superconducting strings, Q-balls, sterile neutrinos, mirror matter, moduli, millicharged fermions, unstable branons, excited WIMPS, electron interacting χos, etc.[\cite=ho04] [\cite=be08]. Unlike the astrophysical sources whose positron production and spatial distributions are determined by independent measurements, all of these DM candidates are ad hoc, using the 511 keV flux measurements to define the needed DM spatial distributions and decay or annihilation rates.

But can any of these DM candidates really explain the Galactic bulge positron annihilation radiation? These suggested candidates ignore the consequences of the fundamental spectral property of the annihilation emission, that [formula]% of the observed[\cite=jo72] [\cite=ch05] [\cite=je06] annihilation from the bulge occurs via positronium (Ps) formation, rather than direct annihilation. Only 25% of the Ps annihilation occurs in the singlet state, producing the 2-photon 511 keV line emission, and 75% occurs in the triplet state, producing a distinctive 3-photon continuum feature, while the direct annihilation produces only 2-photon 511 keV line emission. The Ps annihilation fraction can be directly determined from the observed ratio of the 511 keV line flux to that of the 3-photon continuum feature. The observed flux ratio requires[\cite=gu91] [\cite=je06] that the bulge positrons annihilate almost entirely in the cooler (<  104 K) HII and HI phases of the ISM, where Ps formation is ~  98%, rather than in the hot (> 106 K) plasma, where it is only 20% to 40%, depending on the dust.

These HI and HII phases in the bulge are primarily confined to the dense envelopes of molecular clouds, which are concentrated in the central molecular zone and the surrounding tilted disk. The thin (~   0.1 kpc), tilted disk[\cite=fe07] is inclined 29o from the Galactic plane, and extends ±  0.8 kpc, or [formula] above and below the plane and ±  1.3 kpc, or [formula] in the plane, as viewed nearly face-on from the Earth. Thus, annihilation in the tilted disk appears as part of the bulge, rather than disk, component in the INTEGRAL analyses. As a result, the ~  3o to 9o HWFM of the 511 keV flux reflects this HI and HII gas distribution, not the positron source.

Yet this HI and HII gas fills barely 1% of the total interstellar bulge volume[\cite=fe07] within 3 kpc of the Galactic Center. Nearly all of the suggested DM positrons, however, are expected to be born throughout the bulge volume over a scale of ≥   kpc, so they would be born almost entirely in the hot plasma, since it fills the other 99% of that volume. Therefore, under the assumption that the positrons do not diffuse more than ~   pc from their points of origin, most positrons from DM candidates could not get into the HI and HII gas and could not account for the bulge Ps annihilation fraction. To account for the observed Ps fraction, thus, requires positron propagation on scales of ~   kpc.

Only those few scenarios in which positrons are produced from the interactions of the DM with baryonic or leptonic matter, e.g. [\cite=be08], could concentrate the positron production in the molecular clouds to produce the bulge Ps annihilation fraction. But then the B/D spatial flux ratio could not be satisfied, because most of the mass of the ISM in is the disk rather than the bulge[\cite=fe01] [\cite=fe07].

III. Positron propagation.--However, the assumption that the λ of 1 to 100 MeV positrons in the general ISM is equal to rL, and that they therefore travel no more than a pc in their lifetime[\cite=bo04], is inconsistent with the current understanding of charged particle propagation[\cite=we74] by Larmor resonance scattering. Diffusion on the scale of the rL occurs only in extremely turbulent plasmas, such as relativistic shocks in young SN remnants[\cite=uc07]. But such intense plasma turbulence is highly localized and very short-lived, and these conditions are not applicable to the diffuse ISM, where the mean turbulence is far weaker.

Such a small assumed λ in the ISM is also inconsistent with the direct observations of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons extending down to this energy range[\cite=fa68], as well as their synchrotron radio emission from the Galactic halo[\cite=sy59]. The electron λ needed to explain these observations has long been shown[\cite=sy59] to be >   1 pc, so they can travel >   1 kpc.

Similar λs in the bulge plasma can be understood in terms of the standard particle propagation theory[\cite=we74]. Here charged particle propagation along magnetic flux tubes is dominated by resonant pitch angle scattering by cascading MHD waves at the particle rL. But λ is essentially equal to rL divided by the scattering probability, which is proportional to the relative energy density in the MHD waves at rL compared to that in the total magnetic field, λ  ~  rL / (δB2L / B2o). That probability is (δB2t / B2o)(rL / lo)2 / 3, the product of the relative magnetic energy density in turbulence times the relative energy in the MHD Kolmogorov cascade spectrum at rL compared to that at the initial turbulent scale, lo.

In the hot ([formula] K), tenuous ([formula] H cm- 3) plasma with [formula]G fields that fills the ~   3 kpc bulge[\cite=fe07], 1 to 10 MeV positrons have a stopping distance, dsd  ~   3 to 30 Mpc, but rL  ~  10- 10 to 10- 9 pc. However, the relative turbulent field energy density (δB2t / B2o)  ~  10- 2 in that phase, assuming it is driven by the bulge component of SNe[\cite=ma04]. Occurring at a rate of ~   1SN/1000 yr- 1 and dissipating 1051 erg in ejecta energy over a cascade lifetime of ~  106 yr, SNIa generate a mean bulge turbulent energy density of ~  10- 13 erg cm- 3 compared to an ambient value of ~  10- 11 erg cm- 3. With an lo  ~   50 pc[\cite=ya04], comparable to that of the SNIa remnants, the relative MHD wave energy at rL compared to that at lo is only [formula]. Therefore, the relative energy density in the MHD waves at rL compared to that in the total magnetic field, [formula], so with rL  ~  10- 10 to 10- 9 pc the positron λ  ~  rL / (δB2L / B2o)  ~   0.2 to 5 pc. Thus, such positrons can travel a mean distance lsd  ~  (dsdλ)1 / 2  ~   1 to 10 kpc from their sources before they will stop and annihilate in the hot plasma.

Therefore, the bulk of the positrons born in the bulge can diffuse through the hot plasma without annihilating until they encounter the HI and HII envelopes of the molecular clouds. In these very dense envelopes, similar to that of the cloud cores (~   1000 H cm- 3), the positron dsd is only ~   10 pc, which is comparable to the thickness of the envelopes, so the positrons quickly slow down and annihilate in the cloud envelopes via Ps formation with the Ps fraction of 94±  4% [\cite=jo72] [\cite=ch05] [\cite=je06].

Far more important, however, we clearly see that the basic propagation assumption, on which it was claimed that astrophysical sources failed and DM sources were needed, was invalid.

IV. Consequences of propagation.--Thus even though positron propagation on a kpc scale could solve the Ps fraction problem for DM positrons, propagation on that scale also easily explains the difference between the INTEGRAL B/D ratio of positron annihilation and that of their production by SNIa in the standard model of Galactic iron nucleosynthesis. That difference, of course, together with the assumption of negligible propagation, was why it was argued that there was no astrophysical solution and the only reason that DM matter solutions were proposed.

In particular, we have recently shown[\cite=hi09] that such propagation not only solves both the fundamental B/D and Ps fraction problems but also explains many other detailed features of the Galactic annihilation radiation. Using the SNIa rate based on stellar mass distributions[\cite=de98] and the measured 26Al distributions, roughly half of the [formula] e+ s- 1 total Galactic β+-decay positrons are born within the interstellar bulge <  3 kpc. With the current understanding of propagation[\cite=we74], we show that about 80% of these positrons are expected to annihilate via Ps formation in the HI and HII gas in the bulge, and the remaining 20% are expected to escape into the halo. That gives a total bulge production of [formula] e+ s- 1, equal to the observed[\cite=we08] bulge annihilation rate. The other half of the β+-decay positrons, produced in the Galactic disk, are born primarily in the pervasive warm neutral gas[\cite=fe01]. There MHD waves are damped out by ion-neutral friction[\cite=hi84] well before they cascade down to the positron rL, so these positrons stream through the gas at close to c, and only about 50% of them, or [formula] e+ s- 1, are expected to annihilate in the disk HI and HII gas via Ps, while the other half escape into the halo. Thus, the expected bulge to disk ratio of positron annihilation B / D  ~  1.0 / 0.6  ~  1.6 fully accounts for the observed[\cite=we08] ratio of [formula], leaving no unexplained positron "excess" in the bulge.

Finally, all of the β+-decay positrons that escape from the bulge and disk, [formula] e+ s- 1, naturally account[\cite=hi09] for the Galactic halo annihilation rate of [formula] e+ s- 1, inferred from the INTEGRAL[\cite=we08] 511 keV flux from the halo, adjusted for the expected[\cite=gu91] [\cite=je06] halo Ps annihilation fraction. So, even though most of the Galactic DM is assumed to be in the halo, no unexplained 511 keV flux is observed there either.

V. Conclusions.--We have shown that the suggested need for a new source of Galactic bulge positrons to explain the spatial differences between the observed positron annihilation distribution and that of β+-decay positron production from Galactic iron nucleosynthesis in SNIa was based only on the supposition that the positrons do not travel far before they slow down and annihilate. We showed, however, that the proposed DM sources can not account for the observed Ps fraction without extensive propagation. Although we show that such propagation is expected from current models, we show that then both the spatial differences[\cite=we08] [\cite=we08b] and the Ps fraction[\cite=ch05] [\cite=je06] of the Galactic positron annihilation can be fully explained[\cite=hi09] in all of its details by the standard radionuclei β+-decay sources, anchored on Galactic iron nucleosynthesis. Thus, there is no "excess" signal left to explain.
