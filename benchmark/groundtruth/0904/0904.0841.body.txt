Abstract. Let di(m) denote the coefficients of the Boros-Moll polynomials. Moll's minimum conjecture states that the sequence {i(i + 1)(d2i(m) - di - 1(m)di + 1(m))}1  ≤  i  ≤  m attains its minimum with i = m. This conjecture is a stronger than the log-concavity conjecture proved by Kausers and Paule. We give a proof of Moll's conjecture by utilizing the spiral property of the sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m, and the log-concavity of the sequence {i!di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m.

Keywords: ratio monotonicity, log-concavity, Boros-Moll polynomials.

Introduction

The objective of this note is to give a proof of Moll's conjecture on the minimum value of a sequence involving the coefficients of the Boros-Moll polynomials which arise in the evaluation of the following quartic integral, see, [\cite=Alvarez2001] [\cite=Am] [\cite=George1999-2] [\cite=George1999-3] [\cite=George2001] [\cite=George2004] [\cite=Moll2002]. It has been shown that for any a >  - 1 and any nonnegative integer m, where

[formula]

Write Pm(a) as

[formula]

The polynomials Pm(a) are called the Boros-Moll polynomials. By [\eqref=pma], di(m) can be expressed as

[formula]

From the above formula ([\ref=Defi]) one sees that the coefficients di(m) are positive. Boros and Moll [\cite=George1999-2] [\cite=George1999-3] have proved that for m  ≥  2 the sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is unimodal and the maximum entry appears in the middle, that is,

[formula]

Moll [\cite=Moll2002] conjectured that the sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is log-concave for m  ≥  2. Kauers and Paule [\cite=Kauers2006] have proved this conjecture by using a computer algebra approach. Chen and Xia [\cite=Chen2008] have shown that the sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m satisfies the strongly ratio monotone property which implies the log-concavity and the spiral property. Chen and Gu [\cite=Chen-Gu-2008] have proved that the sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m satisfies the reverse ultra log-concavity. They have also proved that the sequence {i!di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is log-concave.

In fact, Moll [\cite=Moll2007] [\cite=Moll2008] proposed a stronger conjecture than the log-concavity conjecture. He formulated his conjecture in terms of the numbers bi(m) as defined by

[formula]

Clearly, bi(m) = 22mdi(m) and the log-concavity of di(m) is equivalent to that of bi(m).

Given m  ≥  2, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m,

[formula]

attains its minimum at i = m with [formula].

We will give a proof of the above conjecture by using the spiral property of {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m and the log-concavity of {i!di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m.

Proof of Moll's Minimum Conjecture

As pointed out by Moll [\cite=Moll2007], his conjecture implies that {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is log-concave for m  ≥  2. To see this, we may employ a recurrence relation to reformulate his conjecture by using the three terms di - 1(m), di(m) and di + 1(m). Recall that Kauers and Paule [\cite=Kauers2006] and Moll [\cite=Moll2007] have independently derived the following recurrence relation for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m,

[formula]

Note that we have adopted the convention that di(m) = 0 for i < 0 or i > m. From [\eqref=recu4] and the relation di(m) = 2- 2mbi(m), it follows that

[formula]

Thus, Moll's conjecture can be restated as follows.

Given m  ≥  2, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, [formula] attains its minimum at i = m with [formula].

Chen and Xia [\cite=Chen2008] have shown that the Boros-Moll polynomials satisfy the ratio monotone property which implies the log-concavity and the spiral property.

Let m  ≥  2 be an integer. The sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is strictly ratio monotone, that is,

[formula]

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=Theo], the spiral property of {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m can be stated as follows.

For m  ≥  2, the sequence {di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is spiral, that is,

[formula]

Chen and Gu [\cite=Chen-Gu-2008] have shown that {i!di(m)}0  ≤  i  ≤  m is log-concave. This property can be recast in the following form.

For m  ≥  2 and 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1,

[formula]

We are now ready to present a proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm].

Proof. First, it follows from [\eqref=Defi] that

[formula]

We now proceed to show that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1,

[formula]

We first consider the case 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 2. By [\eqref=log-1], we find that

[formula]

Using the spiral property [\eqref=spiral], we see that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 2,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=relatiom-1] and [\eqref=relatiom-2], we get

[formula]

On the other hand, by direct computation we may deduce from [\eqref=Defi] that

[formula]

By [\eqref=I-3] and [\eqref=relatiom-3], we have for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 2,

[formula]

and hence [\eqref=step2] is true for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 2. It remains to consider the case i = m - 1. Again, by [\eqref=Defi] we find that

[formula]

From [\eqref=step1], [\eqref=I-1] and [\eqref=I-2], we deduce that

[formula]

Thus [\eqref=step2] holds for i = m - 1, and so it holds for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1. This completes the proof.

To conclude, we propose the following ratio monotonicity conjecture. If it were true, it would imply that the sequence {i(i + 1)(d2i(m) - di + 1(m)di - 1(m))}1  ≤  i  ≤  m is both spiral and log-concave for m  ≥  2.

The sequence [formula] is strongly ratio monotone.

For example, for m = 8, we have

[formula]

Let [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  8. One can verify that
