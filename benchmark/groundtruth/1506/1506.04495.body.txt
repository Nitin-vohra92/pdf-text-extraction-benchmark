Our note stems from two research directions in combinatorics. The first one is generalization of theorems by replacing Kn by n-chromatic graphs, the second one is Ramsey theory for sparse graphs. Among the theorems from the first direction which admit a generalization is the classical theorem of Rédei [\cite=RE] stating that every tournament on n vertices contains a Hamiltonian path. This theorem extends to any n-chromatic digraph known as the Gallai - Roy - Vitaver theorem [\cite=BG]. A recent example is a theorem of the second author [\cite=GYpack] which shows that a sequence [formula] of trees (Ti has i edges) can be packed into any n-chromatic graph if it can be packed into Kn. Among the theorems which do not admit such a generalization is the Graham-Pollack theorem [\cite=GP] stating that the edge set of Kn cannot be partitioned into less than n - 1 complete bipartite graphs. The possible extension of this to any n-chromatic graph was suggested by Alon, Saks and Seymour but eventually this was disproved by Huang and Sudakov [\cite=HS].

The second direction is Ramsey theory for sparse host graphs, for example where Kn is replaced with graphs of bounded clique number, large girth, bounded minimum degree and n-chromatic graphs. We recall that the Ramsey number [formula] is the smallest integer n for which the following is true: in any coloring of the edges of the complete graph Kn with colors [formula], there is a monochromatic copy of Hi in color i for some [formula]. Furthermore, the chromatic number of a graph G, denoted by χ(G), is the minimum number m of colors for which one can color the vertices of G with m colors so that no two adjacent vertices are colored with the same color.

This note explores the following question: when can we extend a Ramsey-type result by replacing the host graph Kn by any n-chromatic graph? In particular, when does it hold that every t-edge-colored [formula]-chromatic graph contains a monochromatic copy of Hi for some [formula]? A well-known result of Erd os states that there are graphs with arbitrary large chromatic number and arbitrary large girth, therefore positive answer to our question can be expected only if all the graphs Hi are acyclic. For t = 1, R(H1) = |V(H1)|, and the answer is indeed positive, from the folklore statement that for any acyclic H1, any |V(H1)|-chromatic graph contains a copy of H1. We shall prove two further results that give positive answer to our question.

A remark of Erd os and Rado states that in any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph Kn there is a monochromatic spanning tree. This remark have been generalized in many ways, a survey on this subject is [\cite=GYSUR]. Our extension is the following.

In any 2-coloring of the edges of any n-chromatic graph G there is a monochromatic tree on n vertices.

Proof. Consider a coloring of the edges of G with two colors, say red and blue. Let H be the hypergraph on vertex set V(G) whose hyperedges are the vertex sets of the connected components Ci (in both colors). Since each vertex of H is in one red component and in one blue component, the dual of H is a bipartite multigraph B. Observe that two vertex-disjoint edges e,f∈E(B) correspond to two vertices ve,vf∈V(G) that are not covered by any hyperedge (component) in H, in particular (ve,vf)∉E(G). Therefore any set of pairwise disjoint edges in B corresponds to an independent set in G. Consequently, χ(G)  ≤  χ'(B), where χ' is the chromatic index. By König's well-known theorem, χ'(B) = Δ(B) where Δ is the maximum degree. Thus

proving the theorem.  [formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=NEW1] would be suitable to get an extension for t-colorings if the following is true (a variant of the Ryser - Lovász conjecture). Any t-partite t-uniform multihypergraph H satisfies

[formula]

It is natural to ask which properties of monochromatic spanning trees of 2-colored Kn-s can be also ensured for the monochromatic n-vertex trees of n-chromatic graphs in Theorem [\ref=NEW1]. In particular, do they have diameter 3 trees? Zero sum trees? Non-crossing trees? Brooms? (For references see [\cite=GYSUR].)

Our second result is Theorem [\ref=clext], the extension of the following classical result of Cockayne and Lorimer [\cite=CL]. For positive integers satisfying [formula],

[formula]

where niK2 is the matching of size ni, i.e. ni pairwise disjoint edges.

Suppose that [formula] and G is graph such that [formula]. Then in every coloring of the edges of G with t colors, there is a monochromatic niK2 for some i,1  ≤  i  ≤  t.

Proof. We follow the nice proof in [\cite=CL]. Assume G is colored with colors [formula]. Set [formula] and consider a minimal counterexample G, first with respect to t, then with respect to the number of vertices. In particular, we have χ(G) = R. We define the colored complete graph K with vertex set V(G) by extending the coloring of G with all edges of the complement of G as edges of K with color 0. Colors [formula] are called genuine colors. Let c(uv) denote the color of edge uv in K.

By assumption, K has no subgraph niK2 in genuine colors. A subgraph H  ⊂  K is properly colored if no two adjacent edges of H have the same color (for colors [formula]).

There is no properly colored cycle C  ⊂  K.

Proof of Claim [\ref=cyc]. Suppose that C is a properly colored cycle in K, let mi denote the number of edges of C with color i, where [formula]. Note that for any genuine color i, mi < ni. Let G1 be the subgraph of G induced by V(C) and let G2 be the subgraph of G induced by [formula]. Observe that V(C) can be covered with [formula] independent sets: with edges in color 0 and with vertices. Therefore [formula]. Using this,

[formula]

[formula]

Since G2 cannot contain monochromatic (ni - mi)P2 in any genuine color, G2 is a counterexample, smaller than G, contradiction. [formula]

There is no properly colored subtree T  ⊂  K such that T has at least one edge in all genuine colors.

Proof of Claim [\ref=tree]. The proof is along the same line as the proof of Claim [\ref=cyc]. However, replacing C with a tree, we get [formula]. Continuing the same way as before,

[formula]

[formula]

Note that the last inequality is still true because mi  ≥  1 for all [formula]. Again, G2 is a counterexample, smaller than G, contradiction. [formula]

Select a properly colored subtree T  ⊂  K such that T has as many vertices as possible. Since any edge forms a properly colored subtree, such a tree exists with |V(T)|  ≥  2. We shall derive a contradiction to Claim [\ref=tree] by showing that T has at least one edge in all genuine colors.

Assume there is a genuine color, say color t, such that no edge of T is colored with color t. However, in our counterexample some edge uv∈E(G) must be colored with t. From the choice of T and from Claim [\ref=cyc], [formula].

Let w1 be an arbitrary pendant vertex of T. From the maximality of T, c(uw1) = c(w1w2) where w2 is the neighbor of w1 in T. Similarly, there exists w3∈V(T) such that w2w3∈E(T) and c(uw2) = c(w2w3). Note that w3  ≠  w1 otherwise deleting w1 (together with the edge w1w2) from T and adding the path w2u,uv we could have a properly colored subtree larger than T.

Consider the longest path [formula] in T such that c(uwi) = c(wiwi + 1) for every [formula]. From the previous paragraph we know that j  ≥  3. From the definition of T and P it follows that c(uwj) = c(wj - 1wj). Let S denote the set of neighbors of wj - 1 in T and set [formula] ([formula] is possible). Notice that for every s∈S1, we have c(vs) = c(wj - 1s) otherwise u,v,s,wj - 1,u form a properly colored cycle.

Consider the tree U  ⊂  K obtained from T as follows. First remove wj - 1 together with all edges going from wj - 1 to S. Then add edges uv,uwj - 2,uwj and the set of edges {vs:s∈S1}. Now |V(U)| = |V(T)| + 1 thus the coloring of U cannot be proper, there exist edges xy,xz∈E(U) with c(xy) = c(xz). Since the coloring of T is proper, w.l.o.g. [formula].

1. If x = u then y,z∈{v,wj - 2,wj} and c(xy) = c(xz) is impossible because the colors of the edges uv,uwj - 2,uwj are all different.

2. If x = v then [formula]. If (x,y) = (v,s),(x,z) = (v,s') for s,s'∈S1,s  ≠  s', then c(xy) = c(xz) is impossible since c(vs) = c(wj - 1s)  ≠  c(wj - 1s') = c(vs'). If (x,y) = (v,u),(x,z) = (v,s) for s∈S1, then c(vu)  ≠  c(vs) otherwise vs would extend T to a larger properly colored tree.

3. If (x,y) = (wj - 2u) then xz∈E(T) and c(xz) = c(xy) = c(wj - 2u) = c(wj - 2wj - 1) a contradiction since xz and wj - 2wj - 1 are edges of T with the same color.

4. If (x,y) = (wj,u) then xz∈E(T) and with wj + 1 = z, [formula] we could have a path longer than P.

5. If x∈S1 then y = v. Now c(xy) = c(xz) implies that c(xz) = c(xwj - 1) which contradicts the fact that T is properly colored.

We get contradiction, finishing the proof.  [formula]

Zoltán Király [\cite=KI] noticed that Theorem [\ref=clext] follows immediately using [\cite=CL] as a black box. Indeed, to a partition of a t-colored graph G into χ(G) independent sets, where [formula] one can define a t-colored Kn by coloring edge ij with any color that appears on some edge between the i-th and j-th partition classes. Applying Cockayne-Lorimer theorem, there is a matching niK2  ⊂  Kn in color i and it corresponds to a monochromatic matching in G.

We are not aware of any example of acyclic graphs [formula] for which there exists a [formula]-chromatic G with a t-edge-coloring that has no monochromatic Hi in color i for all [formula]. This stimulated "Good graph hunting", an undergraduate research project at the Budapest Semesters of Mathematics program, supervised by the second author. An acyclic graph H is t-good if every t-edge coloring of any [formula]-chromatic graph contains a monochromatic copy of H (there are t arguments in the Ramsey function). Garrison [\cite=G] proved that stars are t-good, as well as the path P4 (except possibly for t = 3) and that P5,P6,P7 are 2-good. In another research project with Riasanovsky and Sherman-Bennett [\cite=GYRS], the generalization of good graphs to (acyclic) hypergraphs was explored and many 2-good 3-uniform hypergraphs were found - but no bad ones at all.
