Neutrino masses and mixing from flavour antisymmetry

Introduction

Orderly pattern of neutrino mixing appears to hide some symmetry, discrete or continuous. It is possible to connect a given mixing pattern with some discrete symmetries of the leptonic mass matrices. Such symmetries may however be residual symmetries arising from a bigger symmetry in the underlying theory. One can obtain a possible larger picture by assuming that these symmetries are a part of a bigger group operating at the fundamental level whose breaking leads to the symmetries of the mass matrices. There is an extensive literature on study of possible residual symmetries of the mass matrices and of the groups which harbor them [\cite=Lam:2008rs] [\cite=Lam:2008sh] [\cite=Lam:2009hn] [\cite=Lam:2011ag] [\cite=Toorop:2011jn] [\cite=deAdelhartToorop:2011re] [\cite=Altarelli:2012ss] [\cite=Holthausen:2012wt] [\cite=Hu:2012ei] [\cite=Hernandez:2012ra] [\cite=Hernandez:2012sk] [\cite=Holthausen:2013vba] [\cite=Holthausen:2013vba] [\cite=Lavoura:2014kwa] [\cite=Fonseca:2014lfa] [\cite=Hu:2014kca], see [\cite=Altarelli:2010gt] [\cite=King:2013eh] [\cite=Smirnov:2011jv] for reviews and additional references.

Starting point in these approaches is to assume the existence of some symmetries Sν (usually a Z2  ×  Z2) and Tl (usually ZN,N  ≥  3) of the (Majorana) neutrino and the charged lepton mass matrices

[formula]

Matrices diagonalizing the 3  ×  3 symmetry matrices Sν,Tl can be related to the mixing matrices in each sector. The structures of these matrices can also be independently fixed if one assume that Sν and Tl represent specific elements of some discrete group Gf in a given three dimensional representation. In this way, the leptonic mixing can be directly related to group theoretical structures. This reasoning has been used for the determination of the neutrino mixing angles in case of the three non-degenerate neutrinos [\cite=Lam:2008rs] [\cite=Lam:2008sh] [\cite=Lam:2009hn] [\cite=Lam:2011ag] [\cite=Toorop:2011jn] [\cite=deAdelhartToorop:2011re] [\cite=Altarelli:2012ss] [\cite=Holthausen:2012wt] [\cite=Hu:2012ei] [\cite=Hernandez:2012ra] [\cite=Hernandez:2012sk] [\cite=Holthausen:2013vba] [\cite=Holthausen:2013vba] [\cite=Lavoura:2014kwa] [\cite=Fonseca:2014lfa] [\cite=Hu:2014kca], two or three degenerate neutrinos [\cite=Hernandez:2013vya] [\cite=Joshipura:2014qaa] and one massless and two non-degenerate neutrinos [\cite=Joshipura:2013pga] [\cite=Joshipura:2014pqa].

The residual symmetries may arise from spontaneous breaking of Gf if the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs fields responsible for generating leptonic masses break Gf but respect Sν,Tl. We wish to study in this paper consequences of an alternative assumption that the spontaneous breaking of Gf leads to an Mν which displays antisymmetry instead of symmetry, i.e. assume that eq.(2) gets replaced by

[formula]

but (1) remains as it is. These assumptions prove to be quite powerful and are able to simultaneously restrict both the mass patterns and mixing angles when embedding of Sν,Tl into Gf is considered. We shall further assume that Sν,Tl belong to some finite discrete subgroup of SU(3) with Det(Sν,Tl) =   ±  1. Then the first consequence of imposing eq.(3) is that DetMν = 0, i.e. at least one of the neutrinos remains massless. Since cases with two (or three !) massless neutrinos are not phenomenologically interesting, we shall restrict ourselves to cases with only one massless neutrino. Then as a second consequence of eq.(3), one can determine all the allowed forms of Mν in a given basis for all possible Sν contained in SU(3). There exist only four possible Mν (and their permutations) consistent with eq.(3) in a particular basis with a diagonal Sν. Two of these give one massless and two non-degenerate neutrinos and the other two give a massless and a degenerate pair of neutrinos which may be identified with the solar pair.

We determine all the allowed textures of the neutrino mass matrix in the next section. Subsequently, we discuss groups Δ(3N2) and Δ(6N2) and identify those which can give correct description of mixing using flavour antisymmetry. In section IV, we introduce Z2  ×  Z2 as neutrino residual symmetry and present an example in which neutrino mass matrix gets fully determined group theoretically except for an overall scale. We discuss a realization of the basic idea with a simple example based on the A4 group in section V. Section VI contains summary and comparison with earlier relevant works.

Allowed textures for neutrino mass matrix

We shall first consider the case of only one Sν satisfying eq.(3) and subsequently generalize it to include two. The unitary matrix Sν can be diagonalized by another unitary matrix VSν:

[formula]

where S̃ν is a diagonal matrix having the form:

[formula]

Unitarity of Sν implies that λ1,2,3 are some roots of unity. They are related by the condition DetSν =  + 1 which we assume without lose of generality. We now go to the basis with a diagonal Sν. Defining ν = VTSνMνVSν, eq.(3) can be rewritten as:

[formula]

It follows that a given element (ν)ij is non-zero only if the factor in bracket multiplying it is zero. This cannot happen for an arbitrary set of λi and one needs to impose specific relation among them to obtain a non-trivial ν. We now argue that only two possible forms of S̃ν and their permutations lead to neutrino mass matrices with two massive neutrinos. The third mass will always be zero as a consequence of eq.(3) and the assumption that Sν belongs to SU(3). These forms of S̃ν are given by:

[formula]

λ is an arbitrary root of unity. This can be argued as follows. Assume that at least one off-diagonal element of ν is non-zero which we take as the 12 element for definiteness. In this case, eq.([\ref=con1]) immediately implies the first of eq.([\ref=dsforms]) as a necessary condition. One can distinguish three separate cases of this condition (I) λ = 1 (II) λ  =    ±  i and (III) [formula]. The entire structures of ν get determined in these cases from condition eq.([\ref=con1]) as follows:

[formula]

where c =  cos θ,s =  sin θ. This structure implies one massless and two degenerate neutrinos with a mass |m0|. In case of (II),

[formula]

This case corresponds to one massless and two non-degenerate neutrinos. In the third case one gets

[formula]

which implies a massless and a pair of degenerate neutrinos.

The cases (I,III) lead to the same mass spectrum but different mixing patterns. ν in eq.([\ref=text1]) is diagonalized as VTννVν  =  diag.(m0,m0,0) with

[formula]

The arbitrary rotation by an angle φ originates due to degeneracy in masses. The texture II, eq.([\ref=text2]) is diagonalized by a unitary rotation in the 12 plane while the one in eq.([\ref=text3]) by a similar matrix with the angle [formula].

The permutations of entries in ν give equivalent structures and are obtained by permuting entries in ν. The case which is not equivalent to above textures follows with a starting assumption that one of the diagonal elements of [formula] say, [formula]. In this case one requires [formula] with [formula]. The case with [formula] gives ν which is already covered. [formula] implies the condition ν in ([\ref=con1]). This leads to a new texture

[formula]

For [formula] one gets permutation of ν or ν and for [formula] only 11 element of ν is non zero and two neutrinos remain massless. Thus conditions eq.([\ref=dsforms]) and their permutations exhaust all possible textures of ν consistent with the antisymmetry of Mν, eq.(3) and two massive neutrinos. Any Gf admitting an element with these sets of eigenvalues will give a viable choice for flavour antisymmetry group. Note that texture III (IV) can be obtained from I(II) by putting s(y) to zero. But the residual symmetries in all four cases are different. Because of this, the embedding groups Gf can also be different. We therefore discuss all these cases separately.

The mixing matrix in texture I contains two unknowns θ and β apart from an overall complex scale m0. This is a reflection of the fact that the corresponding Sν is a Z2 symmetry and contains two degenerate eigenvalues - 1. These unknown can be fixed by imposing another residual Z2 symmetry commuting with Sν and satisfying eq. (2) or (3). We shall discuss such choices in section IV.

Group theoretical determination of mixing

The physical neutrino mixing matrix [formula] depends on the structure of Mν and [formula]. The latter can be determined if the symmetry Tl as in eq.(1) is known. We now make an assumption that Sν satisfying eq.(3) and Tl as in eq.(1) are elements of some discrete subgroup (DSG) of SU(3) denoted by Gf. The DSG of SU(3) have been classified in [\cite=Miller] [\cite=Fairbairn:1964sga] [\cite=Bovier:1980gc]. They are further studied in [\cite=Luhn:2007yr] [\cite=Luhn:2007uq] [\cite=Escobar:2008vc] [\cite=Ludl:2009ft] [\cite=Ludl:2010bj] [\cite=Zwicky:2009vt] [\cite=Parattu:2010cy] [\cite=Grimus:2010ak] [\cite=Grimus:2011fk] [\cite=Grimus:2013apa] [\cite=Merle:2011vy]. These can be written in terms of few 3  ×  3 presentation matrices whose multiple products generate various DSG. Two main groups series called C and D [\cite=Grimus:2013apa] constitute bulk of the DSG of SU(3). Of these, we shall explicitly study two infinite groups series Δ(3N2) and Δ(6N2) which are examples of the type C and D respectively. See [\cite=King:2013vna] [\cite=Ding:2014ora] [\cite=Hagedorn:2014wha] for earlier studies of neutrino mixing using the groups Δ(3N2) and Δ(6N2) and neutrino symmetry rather than antisymmetry.

Eq. (1) implies that Tl commutes with [formula]. Thus, the matrix Ul diagonalizing the former also diagonalizes [formula] and corresponds to the mixing matrix among the left handed charged leptons. Similarly, the matrix Uν diagonalizing Mν gets related to the structure of Sν. In this way, the knowledge of Sν and Tl can be used to determine the mixing matrix

[formula]

This is the strategy followed in the general approach and we shall also use this to determine all possible mixing pattern for a given Gf consistent with eqs.(1) and (3).

Not all the groups Gf can admit an Sν which will provide a legitimate antisymmetry operator Sν, i.e. an element with eigenvalues specified by eq.([\ref=dsforms]). Our strategy would be to determine a class of groups which will have one or more allowed Sν and then look for all viable Tl within these groups. There would be different mixing patterns associated with each choice of Sν,Tl and it is possible to determine all of them analytically for Δ(3N2) and Δ(6N2) groups.

Δ(3N2)

The Δ(3N2) groups are isomorphic to [formula], where [formula] denotes the semi-direct product. The group theoretical details for Δ(3N2) are discussed in [\cite=Luhn:2007uq] [\cite=Ishimori:2010au]. For our purpose, it is sufficient to note that all the elements of the group are generated from the multiple product of two basic generators defined as:

[formula]

with [formula]. Here F generates one of the ZN groups and E generates Z3 in the semi-direct product [formula]. The other ZN group is generated by EFE- 1. The above explicit matrices provide a faithful three dimensional irreducible representation of the group and multiple products of these matrices therefore generate the entire group whose elements can be labeled as:

[formula]

All elements of Δ(3N2) are obtained by varying p,q over the allowed range p,q = 0,1,2,..,N - 1 in the above equation. Thus each matrices W,R,V have N2 elements giving in total 3N2 elements corresponding to the order of Δ(3N2). The eigenvalue equation for the 2N2 non-diagonal elements R and V is simply given by λ3 = 1. These elements therefore have eigenvalues (1,ω,ω2) with [formula]. These are not in the form of eq.([\ref=dsforms]) required to get the neutrino antisymmetry operator Sν. Thus Sν has to come from the N2 diagonal elements. This requires that N,p,q should be such that W(N,p,q) = diag.(ηp,ηq,η- p - q) matches the required eigenvalues S̃ν of Sν given by eq.([\ref=dsforms]) or their permutations. This cannot happen for all the values of variables and one can easily identify the viable cases. It is found that

W can match any of S̃ν only for even N. Thus only Δ(12k2) groups with k = 1,2,.... contain neutrino antisymmetry operator Sν.

The eigenvalue set S̃ν = (1, - 1, - 1) is always contained as a diagonal generator for all Δ(12k2) groups and can be chosen as Sν = W(2k,0,k). Hence the texture I with two degenerate and one massless neutrino can follow in any Δ(12k2). The smallest such group is Δ(12) = A4 which is one of the most studied flavour symmetry from other points of view [\cite=Ma:2001dn] [\cite=Babu:2002dz] [\cite=Altarelli:2005yx] [\cite=Gupta:2011ct] [\cite=Ma:2015pma] [\cite=He:2006dk] [\cite=He:2015gba] [\cite=Hirsch:2007kh] [\cite=Dev:2015dha] [\cite=He:2015afa] [\cite=He:2015gba].

The set S̃ν = (  ±  i,  ±  i, - 1) arises only for N multiple of 4, i.e. in case of groups Δ(48l2), l = 1,2.... These groups also contain a S̃ν satisfying the second of eq.([\ref=dsforms]). Thus textures I,II,IV are possible for all Δ(48l2) groups.

The set S̃ν = (λ, - λ*, - 1) with [formula] and the associated texture III is viable in Δ(12k2) with k  ≥  3

Let us now turn to the mixing pattern allowed within the Δ(12k2) groups. Sν has to be a diagonal operator identified above. Then Tl can be any other diagonal operator W(2k,p,q) or any of R(2k,p,q) or V(2k,p,q). In the former case, [formula], where [formula] denotes a 3  ×  3 identity matrix. The neutrino mixing in this case coincides with Vν diagonalizing any of the four textures of ν giving UPMNS = Vν. None of the allowed Vν are suitable to give the correct mixing pattern with a non-zero θ13. Thus, Tl needs to be any of the non-diagonal element R,V. The matrices VR,V diagonalizing R,V are given by

[formula]

where,

[formula]

The final mixing matrix depends upon the choice of specific texture for ν. Consider the texture I which arises within all the Δ(12k2) groups. Uν = Vν in this case is given by eq.([\ref=unu1]) and [formula]. Since a neutrino pair is degenerate, the solar mixing angle θ12 remains undetermined in the symmetry limit. This is reflected by the presence of an unknown angle φ in eq.([\ref=unu1]). In this case, the neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted and the third column of [formula] needs to be identified with the massless state. It is independent of the angle φ. We get for Tl = R(N,p,q),

[formula]

with [formula] for the group Δ(12k2). p,q take discrete values 0....2k - 1 in above equation while β and θ are unknown quantities appearing in the neutrino mixing matrix eq.([\ref=unu1]). The entries in Ui3 can be permuted by reordering the eigenvalues of Tl. We will identify the minimum of |Ui3|2 with s213. If the minimum of the remaining two is identified with c213s223 then one will get a solution with the atmospheric mixing angle [formula]. In the converse case, one will get a solution [formula]. The experimental values of the leptonic angles are determined through fits to neutrino oscillation data [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa] [\cite=Forero:2014bxa] [\cite=Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa]. Throughout, we shall specifically use the fits presented in [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa] for definiteness. The texture I corresponds to the inverted hierarchy and the best fit values and 3σ ranges appropriate for this case are given [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa] by:

[formula]

Let us mention salient features of results following from eq.([\ref=ui3])

It is always possible to obtain correct θ13,θ23 by choosing unknown quantities θ and β of ν. This should be contrasted with situation found in [\cite=Joshipura:2014qaa] which used neutrino symmetry instead of antisymmetry to obtain a degenerate pair of neutrinos. As discussed there, none of the Δ(3N2) groups could simultaneously account for the values of θ13,θ23 within 3σ.

It is possible to obtain more definite predictions by choosing specific values of θ and or β. In contrast to θ and β which are unknown, the choice of p,q is dictated by the choice of Tl and it is possible to consider any specific choice of p,q in the range 0,...N - 1. Consider a very specific choice of real ν ,i.e. β = 0 and a residual symmetry Tl = E2 corresponding to putting p = q = 0 in eq.([\ref=ui3]). This equation in this case gives a prediction |U23| = |U33| which holds for all values of θ. This relation is equivalent to a maximal θ23 which lies within the 1σ range of the global fits [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa]. θ then can be chosen to get the correct θ13. Since the specific choice p = q = 0 is allowed within all the Δ(12k2) groups, all of them can predict the maximal θ23 and can accommodate correct θ13.

The relation |U23| = |U33| does not hold for a complex ηp + q even if β = 0. Such choices of Tl give departures from maximality in θ23. It is then possible to reproduce both the angles correctly by choosing θ. This is non-trivial since a single unknown θ determines both θ13 and θ23 for a specific choice of group (i.e. N) and a residual symmetry Tl (i.e. p and q). The resulting prediction can be worked out numerically by varying p,q,N over the allowed integer values and θ over continuous range from 0 to 2π. Values of s223 obtained this way are depicted in Fig.(1). This is obtained by requiring that s213 lies within the allowed 1σ range. The phase β is put to zero. It is seen form the Figure that all the Δ(12k2) groups always allow maximal θ23 as already discussed. But solutions away from maximal are also possible for k  ≥  4. The minimal group capable of doing this is Δ(192). The next group Δ(300) can lead to near to the best fit values of the parameters. Specifically the choice Tl = R(10,0,7), Sν = W(10,0,5) within the group and [formula] gives s213  ~  0.024 and s223  ~  0.442 to be compared with the best fit values 0.024 and 0.455 in [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa].

p,q can only be zero or 1 and η is real for the smallest group Δ(12) = A4. In this case, one immediately gets the prediction [formula] for β = 0. μ-τ symmetry is often used to predict the maximal θ23. This is not even contained in A4 which has only even permutations of four objects. Still the use of antisymmetry rather than symmetry allows one to get the maximal θ23 and it also accommodates a non-zero θ13 within A4. This should be contrasted with the situation obtained in case of the use of symmetry condition eq.(2) instead of (3). It is known that in this case A4 group gives democratic value [formula] for s213, see for example [\cite=deAdelhartToorop:2011re].

We now argue that the other three textures though possible within Δ(12k2) groups do not give the the correct mixing pattern. Texture II has one massless and in general two non-degenerate neutrinos. This texture can give both the normal and the inverted hierarchy. The mixing matrix Vν is block-diagonal with a 2  ×  2 matrix giving mixing among two massive states. Given this form for Vν and a general Ul as given in eq.([\ref=vpq]), one finds that the case with inverted hierarchy leads to the prediction [formula] while the normal hierarchy gives instead [formula]. Neither of them come close to their experimental values.

The texture (III) having degenerate pair corresponds to the inverted hierarchy. Vν in this case is block diagonal with an unknown solar angle. Given the most general form, eq.([\ref=vpq]) for Vl one obtains once again the wrong prediction [formula] ruling out this texture as well. Likewise, texture IV also gets ruled out. This corresponds to a diagonal ν with [formula] and |UPMNS| = |Ul| has the universal structure [formula].

To sum up, all the groups Δ(12k2) contain a neutrino antisymmetry operator Sν and allow a neutrino mass spectrum with two degenerate and one massless neutrino and can reproduce correctly two of the mixing angles θ13,θ23. The values for the solar angle and the solar scale have to be generated by small perturbations within these group. We shall study an example based on the minimal group A4  =  Δ(12) in this category in section V.

Δ(6N2) groups

Δ(6N2) groups are isomorphic to [formula] with N = 1,2,3.... The S3 group in the semi-direct product is generated by E in eq.([\ref=cn]) and a matrix

[formula]

The matrices E,F,G provide a faithful irreducible representation of Δ(6N2) [\cite=Escobar:2008vc] and generate the entire group with 6N2 elements. 3N2 elements generated by E,F give the Δ(3N2) subgroup. The additional 3N2 elements are generated from the multiple products of G with elements of Δ(3N2). These new elements can be parameterized by:

[formula]

Here 0  ≤  (m,n) < N - 1. Since Δ(3N2) is a subgroup of Δ(6N2), the neutrino mass and mixing patterns derived in the earlier section can also be obtained here. But the new elements S,T,U allow more possibilities now. In particular, they allow more elements which can be used as neutrino antisymmetry Sν. To see this, note that the eigenvalues of S,T,U are given by (η- m / 2, - η- m / 2, - ηm). This can have the required form, eq.([\ref=dsforms]) when m = 0 or m = N / 2. The eigenvalues in respective cases are (1, - 1, - 1) or ( - i,i,1) and one gets the textures I or IV by using any of S,T,U as neutrino antisymmetry with m = 0 and m = N / 2 respectively. Similarly, possible choices of the charged lepton symmetry Tl also increases. It can be any of the six types of elements: W,R,V as before or S,T,U. Important difference compared to Δ(3N2) is that the texture I can now be obtained for both odd and even values of N by choosing any of the S,T,U with m = 0 as neutrino antisymmetry. Texture IV still requires m = N / 2 and hence even N for its realization. We determine mixing matrix U for each of these textures and discuss them in turn.

Texture I

The residual anti symmetries which lead to texture I can be either (1) Sν = W(2k,0,k) or (2) Sν = P(N,0,n) where P = S,T,U. The residual symmetry Tl of [formula] can be any elements in the group which we divide in three classes: (A) ~ Tl  =  W(N,p,q), (B) ~ Tl = P(N,p,q) and (C) ~ Tl = Q(N,p,q). Here and in the following, we use symbols P and Q to collectively denote P = S,T,U and Q = R,V. We use the basis as specified in eqs.([\ref=elements6nsquare],[\ref=elements3nsquare]) for Sν,Tl. Then the neutrino mixing matrix is given by Uν = Vν in case (1) while it is given by Uν = VP(N,0,n)Vν in case (2). This follows by noting that the texture ν given in eq.([\ref=text1]) holds in a basis with diagonal Sν but Sν in the chosen group basis of eq.([\ref=elements6nsquare]) is non-diagonal in case (2). The neutrino mass matrix in this basis is thus given by [formula] where VP diagonalizes P(N,0,n). The matrix Uν which diagonalizes Mν is then given by Uν = VP(N,0,n)Vν where Vν diagonalizes ν. Explicitly, [formula] with

[formula]

We have chosen the ordering of columns of VP in such a way that the first column always corresponds to the eigenvalue η- p / 2. With this ordering one gets the texture I given in eq.([\ref=text1]) when P(N,0,n) is used as neutrino antisymmetry.

The matrices Ul diagonalizing Tl in three cases above are given in the same basis by [formula] in cases (A),(B),(C) respectively where VQ are given in eq.([\ref=vpq]). Thus we have six (four) different choices for Ul (Uν) giving in all 24 leptonic mixing matrices UPMNS. We list these choices and the corresponding UPMNS matrices in Table I.

Not all of 24 mixing matrices listed in Table I give independent predictions for the third column of UPMNS which determines s13 and s23. We discuss the independent ones below.

The choice (1A) giving UPMNS = Vν has one of the entries zero and thus cannot lead to correct θ13 or θ23. The choice (1C) involves only elements belonging to the Δ(3N2) subgroup and its predictions are already discussed in the previous section. The remaining choices give new predictions. The case (1B) leads to three different UPMNS. One obtained with Tl = S(N,p,q) contain a zero entry in the third column and can be used only as a zeroeth order choice. One gets the following result in (1B) if Tl = T(N,p,q)

[formula]

The ordering of the entries |Ui3|2 can be changed by rearranging the eigenvectors of of Tl appearing in Ul. We have chosen here and below an ordering which is consistent with the values of the parameters s213,s223 when U is equated with the standard form of the mixing matrix.The result in the third case with Tl = U(N,p,q) can be obtained from above by the replacement s  ↔  c. All the three entries above follow for all the choices of p,q and the phase β. The case (1B) in this way gives a universal prediction. Two of the |Ui3|2 are equal within this choice and they correspond to c213c223 and c213s223. Equality of the two then implies a θ independent prediction [formula]. s213 in the above case is then given by s2 and can match the experimental value with appropriate choice of the unknown θ. Since the choice of Sν within (1B) is possible only for even N it follows that all the groups Δ(24k2) lead to a prediction of the maximal atmospheric mixing angle and can accommodate the correct θ13.

The choice (2A) also gives the same result for |Ui3|2 as (1B) with an important difference. The neutrino residual symmetry used in this choice is allowed for all N and not necessarily N = 2k. Thus one gets a universal prediction of the maximal θ23 for all p,q,θ,β within all Δ(6N2) groups.The smallest group in this category is the permutation group S4  =  Δ(24) which contain symmetries appropriate for both the cases (1B) and (2A).

There are two independent structures within nine possible choices contained in case (2B). The example of the first one is provided by the choice Sν = S(N,0,n) and Tl = S(N,p,q). The elements in the third column of mixing matrix are given in this case by

[formula]

While this choice does not give universal prediction as in the case (1B) discussed above it still leads to a prediction for θ23 which is independent of the unknown angle θ and phase β:

[formula]

This follows from eq.([\ref=2Bss]) when |U13|2 is identified with s213. The predicted θ23 now depends only on the group theoretical factors N,p,q,n.

Unlike (1B), both the maximal and non-maximal values are allowed for θ23 in this case. The former occurs whenever [formula]. The latter occurs for other choices. It is possible to find values of parameters which lead to a non-maximal θ23 within the experimental limits. The minimal such choice occurs for N = 7, i.e. the group Δ(294) which leads as shown in Table II to a sin 2θ23 within the 2σ range as given in [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa]. The next example of the group Δ(486) fairs slightly better.

The other prediction of the case (2B) is obtained with Sν = S(N,0,n) and Tl = T(N,p,q). One obtains in this case

[formula]

In this case, θ23 is necessary non-maximal if θ13 is to be small but non-zero. We may identify, |U13|2 with s213 and fix s2 = 2s213. This determines the other two entries of |Ui3|2 for a given p,q,β. For p = q = β = 0 one obtains sin 2θ23 either 0.345 or 0.655. Thus all the Δ(6N2) groups with this specific choice give results close to the 3σ range in the global fits. This prediction can be improved by turning on β or choosing different Tl. An example based on the group Δ(150) giving sin 2θ23 close to the best fit value [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa] is shown in the table.

Predictions of the case (2C) can also be similarly worked out. Six different UPMNS are associated with this choice but not all give different predictions for the third column. One of the independent structures corresponds to choosing Tl = R(N,p,q) and Sν = S(N,0,n). The [formula] gives

[formula]

Rest of the choices within (2C) differ from the above only in the powers of η. Their predictions can be obtained from the above by choosing different values of p,q,n.

Eq.([\ref=predict2C]) gives s13,s23 withing 3σ range for a suitable choice of N,p,q,θ,β. In particular, one predicts a maximal θ23 if p = q = β = 0 as in the earlier cases. But now the maximal value of θ also becomes a viable choice for all the groups Δ(6N2). This makes the choice in this class particularly interesting since such value of θ can be forced by some additional symmetry. With the choice Tl = E2 corresponding to p = q = 0, eq.([\ref=predict2C]) gives for n = β = 0,

[formula]

The maximal value of θ then leads to s213  ~  0.029 which is close to 2σ range as obtained in [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa]. One can obtain a better solution with a different choice for p and q and θ. One particular solution based on the group Δ(150) is shown in the table.

Texture IV

The diagonal texture IV given in eq.([\ref=text4]) can be realized in Δ(6N2) for even N with the choice Sν = P(2k,k,n). This texture has two non-degenerate and one massless neutrino. Thus both the normal and the inverted hierarchies are possible. The massless state has to be identified with the third (first) column of the mixing matrix for the inverted (normal) hierarchy. The neutrino mixing matrix Uν in this case is given by the matrix which diagonalizes P(2k,k,n). This is given for the inverted hierarchy by VP(2k,k,n) as defined in eq.([\ref=vstu]). For the normal hierarchy, one instead gets Uν = VP(2k,k,n)Z13 where Z13 exchanges the first and the third column of of the mixing matrix obtained in case of the inverted hierarchy. Possible choice of Tl can be any of the six types of generators and corresponding mixing matrices Ul are the same as given in Table I with the choice (2A),(2B),(2C). It is then straightforward to work out the final mixing matrices UPMNS. As the massless state in the basis with diagonal Sν is given by (1,0,0)T and its cyclic permutation for Sν = S,T,U, the third column of the UPMNS is given by [formula] when Sν = S,T,U. It follows from the structure of Ul that the third column has either one or two zero entries or all elements have equal magnitudes. The same applies to the first column of UPMNS in case of the normal hierarchy. In either case, the texture IV cannot give phenomenologically consistent result at the zeroeth order.

More predictive scenario: Z2  ×  Z2 symmetry

We have assumed so far that the flavour antisymmetry Sν is the only invariance of the neutrino mass matrix. This fails in determining ν completely in case of the texture I which still has two unknown quantities θ and β . We give here example of an enlarged residual symmetry of Mν which serves to determine ν completely apart from an overall complex mass scale. We use an additional symmetry [formula] commuting with Sν for this purpose. It should be such that [formula] and Tl together are contained in some Gf. Mν may be antisymmetric with respect to transformation by [formula] also. In this case, it will be symmetric with respect to the product [formula]. Instead we assume that [formula] is a symmetry of Mν, i.e.

[formula]

We can transform above equation to the basis with a diagonal Sν by defining [formula]. In this basis, we get

[formula]

As before, we demand [formula] to be contained in SU(3). If it is diagonal, then   =  diag.(λ1,λ2,λ*1λ*2) with λ1,2 being roots of unity. Then eq.([\ref=snuprime2]) when applied to ν in eq.([\ref=unu1]) implies that either [formula] is proportional to identity or s = 0 or c = 0. A non-trivial prediction can be obtained if ' is non-diagonal. Since   =  diag.(1, - 1 - 1), a general [formula] commuting with [formula] should have a block diagonal structure with the lower 2  ×  2 block non-trivial. This block gets further restricted from the requirement that [formula] are elements of some discrete group Gf. These requirements can be met within the already considered groups Δ(6N2).

Consider the group Δ(12k2). The choice Sν  =   = W(2k,0,k) = diag.(1, - 1, - 1) within it leads to texture I as already discussed. This commutes with all the discrete symmetries having a general form S(M,m,n) as in eq.([\ref=elements6nsquare]). Thus a viable choice for [formula] is provided by [formula]. Note that since Sν is already diagonal, [formula]. Then eq.([\ref=snuprime2]) and the form of ν implies a restriction:

[formula]

which fixes the unknown angle θ and phase β. Mixing pattern can be determined by choosing appropriate Tl and let us choose Tl = R(N,p,q). Since both Tl and Sν are contained in Δ(12k2) mixing pattern is determined by the corresponding eq. ([\ref=ui3]) but now with θ and β satisfying eq.([\ref=theta]) which follows from the inclusion of [formula] as a residual symmetry. We can vary p,q,M,N,n in eq([\ref=ui3]) and look for a viable choice. Consider M = N in which case [formula] are contained in Δ(6N2). By varying p,q,N one finds that the minimum group giving acceptable θ13,θ23 is Δ(600) corresponding to N = 10. One possible set of residual symmetries within Δ(600) is given by

[formula]

With this choice, the [formula] coincides with the μ-τ symmetry and eqs.([\ref=ui3],[\ref=theta]) give a prediction

[formula]

to be compared with the 3σ region given in eq.([\ref=fits]).

An A4 model with flavour antisymmetry

Our discussion so far has been at the group theoretical level. We now present an explicit realization of flavour antisymmetric neutrino mass matrix using A4 as an example. A4 has been extensively used for several different purposes, for obtaining degenerate neutrinos [\cite=Ma:2001dn] [\cite=Babu:2002dz], to realize tri-bimaximal mixing [\cite=He:2006dk] [\cite=Altarelli:2005yx] for obtaining maximal CP phase δ [\cite=Gupta:2011ct] [\cite=Ma:2015pma] [\cite=Dev:2015dha] [\cite=He:2015gba] [\cite=He:2015afa] or to obtain texture zeros [\cite=Hirsch:2007kh] in the leptonic mass matrices. As we discuss here, it also provides a viable alternative to get a massless and two quasi degenerate neutrinos with correct mixing pattern. In the following, we discuss the required symmetry, Higgs content and identify the vacuum needed to obtain antisymmetry. We also discuss possible perturbations which can split the degenerate pair and lead to the solar scale and mixing angle. The aim is not to construct a detailed model but to illustrate how the basic proposal of the paper can be used for construction of a model.

The group theory of A4 is discussed extensively in many papers. We shall not elaborate on it. We follow the basis choice as given for example in [\cite=He:2006dk]. In this basis, all the 12 elements of A4  =  Δ(12) can be generated from the two elements E and F defined in eq.([\ref=cn]) with η =  - 1.

We consider supersymmetric model with MSSM extended by a triplet Higgs field Δ. The standard doublets Hu,Hd and Δ are A4 singlets. We use two flavon fields χν and χe to break A4 and generate the flavour structures. Both these fields as well as the three generations of the leptonic doublets lL transform as triplets of A4. The right handed charged leptons transform as [formula] representation of A4. We also impose an additional Z3 symmetry under which (lL,χν)  →  ω(lL,χν) and χe  →  ω2χe. All other fields are assumed singlet under the Z3. The charged lepton masses arise from the following superpotential

[formula]

and the neutrino masses follow from

[formula]

Here, C is the charge conjugation matrix. The subscript a in (..)a labels the A4 representation according to which the quantity (...) transforms. The scale M and the flavon vacuum expectation values generate the effective Yukawa couplings in the model. The additional symmetry Z3 introduced here serves two purposes. It prevents χe(χν) couplings in Wν(Wl) at the leading order. It also forbids a singlet term (lTLCΔlL)1 allowed by the A4 symmetry.

The residual symmetries of the leptonic mass matrices are determined from the above superpotential by the flavon vacuum expectation values (vev). We shall choose these symmetries in accordance with the discussion given in section II. The symmetry Tl of [formula] is chosen as E or E2. This is realized when vev <  χe  >   of χe satisfies E < χe >  =  < χe  >  .This requires equal vev for all the three components of χe and leads to a well-known form of Ml considered in many models based on A4, see for example [\cite=He:2006dk]. The charged lepton mixing is determined in this case by Ul = Uω defined in eq.([\ref=uw]). Only possible choice within A4 for Sν leading to flavour antisymmetry is given by F or its cyclic permutations. In order to realize this antisymmetry as residual invariance, we impose Sν  <  χν >  =  -  < χν  >   with Sν = F. This leads to the configuration <  χ1 >  = 0 and [formula]. Here v2,3 are complex parameters in general. It is seen that eq.([\ref=wnu]) then leads to the flavour antisymmetric mass matrix given in eq.([\ref=text1]) with [formula], β = Arg(v2v*3) and appropriately defined m0. The neutrino mixing matrix in this case is Uν = Vν. The resulting mixing pattern is a special case of eq.([\ref=ui3]) obtained for Δ(12k2) with Tl = R(2k,p,q) and Sν = W(2k,0,k). In the present case, the residual symmetry Tl = E2 coincides with R(2,0,0) and Sν = F = W(2,0,1). Thus Ui3 can be obtained by putting p = q = 0 and η =  - 1 in eq.([\ref=ui3]). As already discussed, this leads to a prediction [formula] for β = 0 independent of the choice of θ. The latter can be chosen to give the correct θ13 while the solar angle and scale remain unpredicted at this stage due to degeneracy in mass. We now discuss possible perturbations which can generate them

One source of perturbation that we consider comes from the A4  ×  Z3 invariant non-leading corrections to Wν, eq.([\ref=wnu]). These are given by

[formula]

Only the first two terms give non-zero contribution when all the components of χe acquire equal vev. The neutrino mass matrix including these correction is given by

[formula]

where ε1,2  ≪  1. Eq. ([\ref=nonleading]) corrects the leading order non-zero elements (ν)12 and (ν)13. We have absorbed these corrections through redefinition of θ,β and m0. ε1,2 are new corrections arising from eq.([\ref=nonleading]). Eq.([\ref=nonleading]) does not exhaust all the non-leading corrections. One could also write similar corrections to Wl quadratic in χν. These will correct the charged lepton mixing. Similarly, a more elaborate realistic model leading to the assumed vacuum configuration will also contain non-leading corrections which may change the leading order vev assumed here. All these corrections will add more parameters to the model and we assume their contribution to be small. Here we show that two parameters ε1,2 introduced by eq.([\ref=nonleading]) in eq.([\ref=pert]) are sufficient to reproduce the neutrino mixing and scales correctly. They split the degeneracy and generate the solar scale and angle correctly. For example,

[formula]

give the following values of the observables

[formula]

which corresponds to (nearly) best fit values obtained for example with a global fits in [\cite=Capozzi:2013csa].

Summary

The bottom up approach of finding discrete symmetry groups starting with possible symmetries of the residual mass matrices has been successfully used in last several years to predict leptonic mixing angles. The residual symmetry assumed in these works leaves the neutrino mass matrix Mν invariant. We have proposed here a different possibility in which Mν displays antisymmetry as defined in eq.(3) under a residual symmetry. Just like symmetry, the antisymmetry can also come from breaking of some discrete group Gf as we have illustrated with an example based on A4. The use of antisymmetry is found to be more predictive than symmetry. It is able to restrict both neutrino masses and mixing angles unlike all the previous works in this category which [\cite=Lam:2008rs] [\cite=Lam:2008sh] [\cite=Lam:2009hn] [\cite=Lam:2011ag] [\cite=Toorop:2011jn] [\cite=deAdelhartToorop:2011re] [\cite=Altarelli:2012ss] [\cite=Holthausen:2012wt] [\cite=Hu:2012ei] [\cite=Hernandez:2012ra] [\cite=Hernandez:2012sk] [\cite=Holthausen:2013vba] [\cite=Holthausen:2013vba] [\cite=Lavoura:2014kwa] [\cite=Fonseca:2014lfa] [\cite=Hu:2014kca] could predict only mixing angles. Moreover, the antisymmetry condition by itself is sufficient for determining all possible discrete residual antisymmetry operators Sν residing in SU(3). This in turn leads to very specific textures of the neutrino mass matrix satisfying antisymmetry condition. These are given by eqs.([\ref=text1],[\ref=text2],[\ref=text3],[\ref=text4]).

We studied the mixing angle predictions in the specific context of the groups Δ(3N2) and Δ(6N2). The main results obtained are:

Only the groups Δ(12k2) with k = 1,2... and all Δ(6N2) groups contain the residual antisymmetry operator.

Of the four possible neutrino mass textures allowed by antisymmetry, only texture I having one massless and two degenerate neutrinos can lead to correct mixing pattern. This case provides a very good zeroeth order approximation to reality if the neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted.

There always exists within these groups residual symmetries of [formula] and Mν such that the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is maximal. Correct value of θ13 can be accommodated by choosing the unknown angle in eq.([\ref=text1]) appropriately. There also exists other choices of residual symmetries which for some groups allow non-maximal values of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle as well. The results of various cases are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table II.

The successful texture I still has two free parameters apart from an overall mass scale. But as we have shown here, predicted atmospheric mixing angle in many cases is independent of these unknowns. The reactor angle θ13 depends on it but it is possible to determine these unknown also by enlarging the residual symmetry and we have given an example of a Z2  ×  Z2 residual symmetry which can determine the complete neutrino mass matrix up to an overall scale in terms of group theoretical parameters alone and have identified Δ(600) as a possible group which can give correct θ13 and θ23 with this symmetry.

We end this section with a comparison of the present work with some earlier relevant works.

The texture I, eq.([\ref=text1]) has been extensively studied since long in the context of Le - Lμ - Lτ global symmetry which implies it, see for example [\cite=Goh:2002nk] and references therein. Imposition of this symmetry on the charged lepton mass matrix Ml makes it diagonal after redefinition of θ appearing in ([\ref=text1]). Thus the matrix Vν as given in eq.([\ref=unu1]) corresponds to the final mixing matrix which is now not allowed by the present experimental constraints. This is not the case here since the [formula] is non-trivial with the imposed discrete symmetry.

Neutrino mass matrix displaying a specific flavour antisymmetry namely, μ-τ antisymmetry was studied in [\cite=Grimus:2005jk]. This antisymmetry was assumed there to hold in the neutrino flavour basis. In our terminology, this would correspond to study of a specific example within the choice (2A) discussed in section IIIB. The structure of the neutrino mass matrix and the mixing angle predictions obtained here for this choice agrees with ref.[\cite=Grimus:2005jk] after suitable basis change. The study presented here is not limited to the μ-τ antisymmetry but encompasses all possible antisymmetry operators within SU(3) and leads to many new phenomenological predictions.

The antisymmetry condition, eq.(3), can be converted to the usually assumed symmetry condition by redefining the operator Sν  →  iSν. The new operator does not however have unit determinant and would belong to a U(3) group. The occurrence of massless state within such group with condition, eq.(2) was discussed in [\cite=Joshipura:2013pga] [\cite=Joshipura:2014pqa]. The residual symmetry operators used there had eigenvalues (η,1, - 1) (or its permutations) with [formula]. This coincides with eigenvalues of iSν for texture IV when η = i. Only texture IV was considered in [\cite=Joshipura:2013pga] [\cite=Joshipura:2014pqa] and it was shown there that a large class of DSG of U(3) imply sin 2θ13 to be either 0 or [formula] with condition (2). The same conclusion is found to be true here with eq.(3) and texture IV in case of the group series Δ(3N2) and Δ(6N2).

It is possible to obtain a degenerate pair of neutrinos using symmetry condition, eq.(2) and DSG of SU(3). This was studied for the finite von-Dyck groups in [\cite=Hernandez:2013vya] and for all DSG of SU(3) having three dimensional IR in [\cite=Joshipura:2014qaa]. Here, the third state is not implied to be massless. The case of one massless and two degenerate neutrinos can follow from the symmetry condition if DSG of U(3) are used. This was also discussed in [\cite=Joshipura:2014qaa]. The successful examples found in these two works are different from here because of the difference in the assumed residual symmetries. The cases studied in the context of DSG of SU(3) and U(3) [\cite=Joshipura:2014qaa] have texture similar to the texture II in the present terminology. It was found there that this texture can give non-trivial values of s213, s223 in several Δ(6N2) groups when symmetry condition (2) is used. This does not happen with the antisymmetry condition in case of texture II as argued here. On the other hand, one can obtain correct values for θ13 and θ23 in all the Δ(3N2) groups with texture I when antisymmetry condition is employed. Thus symmetry and antisymmetry conditions appear complementary to each other and allow more possibilities for flavour symmetries Gf.
