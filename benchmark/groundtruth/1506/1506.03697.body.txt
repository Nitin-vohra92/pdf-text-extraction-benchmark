Early Transcendental Analysis

Motivation

As Weintraub states in his 1997 article in the American Mathematical Monthly [\cite=Weintraub_paper], several current calculus texts have "early transcendental" versions, in which the exponential and logarithmic functions are introduced early in the text. The existence and properties of those functions are justified by "hand-waving" arguments.

In contrast to this, "late transcendental" versions of the calculus texts have more rigorous proofs. A disadvantage of the late transcendental approach is that relatively advanced topics such as integration or infinite series are introduced before the more elementary concepts of the exponential and logarithmic functions. However, the level of rigor appropriate to a calculus course is sufficient for a convincing "late transcendental" treatment, but apparently not for a self-contained "early transcendental" one.

Teachers who prefer the early transcendental approach (ETA) over the late transcendental approach (LTA) can be confident that the ETA is no less rigorous than the LTA. An advantage of the LTA is that it is close to the historical development [\cite=Edwards_book]. An advantage of the ETA is that it is very intuitive. We show here a way to justify the ETA rigorously, in a manner suitable for a first (post-calculus sequence) course in Analysis.

Arguably, the rôle of rigor in a calculus course is to introduce the student to the idea of mathematical proof rather than to endow our statements with unshakeable certainty. The latter goal is certainly unattainable in a traditional calculus course, in which the real numbers themselves are defined only intuitively - they are not constructed. Therefore the teacher choosing the ETA over the LTA need not worry that the ETA seems less self-contained than the LTA. Indeed, the justification of the ETA can simply be postponed to an Analysis course.

The essence of the ETA, as it is currently presented in calculus textbooks, is as follows: For a  =  1 / 2, plot a sequence of points with integer coordinates (n,an) and connect them with a smooth curve, as in figure a) below. Repeat the experiment with a  =  2 and a  =  5 as in figures b) and c). Observe that the curves all seem to have tangent lines at the point (0,1) and sketch those tangent lines, as in figures a), b) and c). Notice that the slope of the tangent line seems to increase strictly and smoothly with a, without upper or lower bound. Conjecture that there is therefore a unique value of a for which the tangent line has slope equal to one, and define e as this value. Sketch the corresponding curve and tangent line as in figure d) below. In general, define ln a as the slope of the tangent line to y  =  ax at the point (0,1). Thus ln e  =  1 by definition of e.

Note that by associativity of multiplication

[formula]

for positive integer values of x and y. Conjecture that the relationship ax + y  =  axay extends to arbitrary real values of x and y. Using this conjecture, compute

[formula]

Take limits as h  →  0, yielding

[formula]

In particular, note that

[formula]

This concludes our brief description of the heart of the ETA, at the level of a Calculus course.

The author of [\cite=Weintraub_paper] essentially defines the exponential function as an infinite series, and differentiates it using term-by-term differentiation of the series. Despite its historical precedent, [\cite=Edwards_book], we feel that this is a departure from the spirit of the ETA. Alternatively, the exponential function ax can be introduced as the continuous extension from the rationals to the reals of the familiar function ap / q, as in [\cite=Tao_book]. We prove, using this definition and using only elementary techniques such as the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, that ax is differentiable. We retrace exactly the steps of the ETA as described above, this time with complete rigor. We recommend that, if a calculus class is taught using the (nonrigorous) ETA, and if it is followed by a class in Analysis, then that Analysis class should use the rigorous ETA as explained herein.

Literature review

We refer the interested reader to [\cite=Edwards_book] for a fascinating history of the logarithmic and exponential functions.

The authors of [\cite=Bartle_and_Sherbert_book], [\cite=Burkill_book], [\cite=Burkill_and_Burkill_book], [\cite=Burrill_and_Knudsen_book], [\cite=Cooper_book], [\cite=Gaskill_and_Narayanaswami_book], [\cite=Kirkwood_book], [\cite=Krantz_book], [\cite=Leadership_Project_Committee_book], [\cite=Maude_book], [\cite=Reade_book], [\cite=Rudin_book], [\cite=Stromberg_book], [\cite=Whitaker_and_Watson_book] and [\cite=White_book] define ex by its Taylor-McLaurin series. Of these, [\cite=Burkill_and_Burkill_book], [\cite=Burrill_and_Knudsen_book], [\cite=Cooper_book], [\cite=Krantz_book], [\cite=Leadership_Project_Committee_book], [\cite=Maude_book], [\cite=Reade_book] and [\cite=White_book] then prove that [formula] by term-by-term differentiation of the Taylor-McLaurin series. The authors of [\cite=Bartle_and_Sherbert_book], [\cite=Burkill_book], [\cite=Gaskill_and_Narayanaswami_book], [\cite=Kirkwood_book], [\cite=Rudin_book], [\cite=Stromberg_book] and [\cite=Whitaker_and_Watson_book] on the other hand prove that [formula] as follows: First by using the series definition of ex to prove that ex + y  =  exey. Then by manipulating the series and using a theorem about continuity of power series, it follows that the required limit exists.

The authors of [\cite=Courant_book_I], [\cite=Courant_and_John_book], [\cite=Fulks_book], [\cite=Gaughan_book_4], [\cite=Gaughan_book_5], [\cite=Protter_and_Morrey_book_91] and [\cite=Smith_book] define ln x by a definite integral. They then define ex as the inverse of ln x, except for [\cite=Courant_and_John_book] who define ax in the same way as we do, and define e by [formula], and then prove that ex is the inverse of ln x. In all eight of these sources, ex is then differentiated using the chain rule or the Inverse Function Theorem, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

In [\cite=Granville_and_Smith_and_Longley_book], [\cite=Haeussler_and_Paul_book] and [\cite=Kaplan_book] e is defined as lim x  →  0(1  +  x)1 / x. In [\cite=Haeussler_and_Paul_book] and [\cite=Kaplan_book] this limit is also used to give a numerical approximation to the value of e. These three sources define ln x as the inverse function of ex. They use the existence of the above limit and properties of logarithms to prove that [formula]. They then deduce, via the chain rule, that [formula]. The authors of [\cite=Haeussler_and_Paul_book] draw a graph to justify the existence of the key limit. There is no graph in [\cite=Kaplan_book], nor are there as many details as in [\cite=Haeussler_and_Paul_book]. The authors of [\cite=Granville_and_Smith_and_Longley_book] admit that proving that [formula] exists is beyond the scope of their book.

The authors of [\cite=Gupta_and_Rani_book] define ax as we do, and they define log ax as the inverse of ax. They define e as [formula].

Reference [\cite=Goldstein_and_Lay_and_Schneider_book] takes the same approach as we do but with much less rigour. They claim without proof that ax is differentiable at 0, and that there is a unique value e defined as we define it here.

In [\cite=Agnew_book] the author defines ax as we do, then shows that its derivative at zero exists by writing it in terms of a telescoping sum which becomes a Riemann sum, which converges to a certain definite integral.

In [\cite=Goldberg_book] sinh - 1x is defined by a definite integral, and cosh x as [formula]. The author then uses the Inverse Function Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to differentiate sinh x, showing that [formula] hence sinh 'x  =   cosh x. It then follows, from the equation before last, that sinh ''x  =   sinh x, hence cosh 'x  =   sinh x. The author then defines ex as cosh x  +   sinh x, and deduces from the above that [formula].

Theory

That rational powers aq of positive reals a exist is a consequence of the supremum property of [formula]. See for example [\cite=Tao_book]. By a further application of the supremum property, one can define arbitrary real powers of positive reals as follows:

Given a  >  0 and [formula], let [formula].

We take for granted the proofs of the following two theorems, see for instance [\cite=Tao_book].

For [formula] with x  >  0 and [formula] (i) xa is strictly decreasing in x  >  0 for a  <  0 (ii) xa is strictly increasing in x  >  0 for a  >  0 (iii) xa is continuous in x  >  0

For [formula] with a,b  >  0 and [formula] (i) ax  +  y  =  axay (ii) (ax)y  =  axy (iii) For 0  <  a  <  1, ax is strictly decreasing in x and for a  >  1, ax is strictly increasing in x (iv) ax is continuous in x (v) a1  =  a (vi) a0  =  1 (vii) ax  >  0 (viii) For 0 < a < 1, lim x  →    -    ∞ax  =    +    ∞   and lim x  →    +    ∞ax  =  0, and for a  >  1, lim x  →    -    ∞ax  =  0 and lim x  →    +    ∞ax  =    +    ∞   (ix) axbx  =  (ab)x.

For non-negative real numbers [formula],

[formula]

with equality if and only if [formula].

The statement is trivially true when n  =  1. In case n  =  2, given a1,a2  ≥  0 we have [formula], whence [formula], and [formula]. Evidently equality obtains if and only if a1  =  a2. We will prove the general statement by induction on n. Indeed, suppose the statement holds for some [formula] and suppose that [formula]. Let [formula]. By the case n = 2 and by the induction hypothesis and by Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] parts (ii) and (ix) we have

[formula]

the condition for equality being that [formula] and [formula] and an + 1  =  A, equivalently that [formula]. Dividing both sides of the inequality [formula] by [formula] we have [formula], and raising both sides to the power of [formula] gives [formula], as required. This completes the proof by induction.

Denote [formula] by [formula].

For [formula] and [formula] with h  <  k,

[formula]

Let [formula] and let [formula] with 0  <  h  <  k. Then there exist [formula] such that [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:_arithmetic-geometric_mean_inequality] we have [formula] i.e. [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (ii) this means that [formula], i.e. [formula]. Given that h  >  0 this yields

[formula]

Now assume that [formula] with h  <  k  <  0. From [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_0_<_h_<_k] [\eqref=h] [\eqref=k_rational] we have [formula]. Replacing a by a- 1 gives [formula], and by Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (ii) we have [formula], hence

[formula]

Now let [formula] with h > 0. Then (ah  -  1)2  ≥  0, 0  ≤  (ah)2  -  2ah  +  1 and ah  -  1  ≤  (ah)2  -  ah, so by Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] parts (i), (vi) and (vii), 1  -  a- h  ≤  ah  -  1 and

[formula]

Let [formula] with h  <  0  <  k, and let x  =   min (|h|,|k|). Then by inequalities [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_h_<_k_<_0] [\eqref=h] [\eqref=k_rational], [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_-h_and_h] [\eqref=h_real] and [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_0_<_h_<_k] [\eqref=h] [\eqref=k_rational], [formula], hence

[formula]

Considering inequalities [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_0_<_h_<_k] [\eqref=h] [\eqref=k_rational] , [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_h_<_k_<_0] [\eqref=h] [\eqref=k_rational] and [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_h_<_0_<_k] [\eqref=h] [\eqref=k_rational] we have

[formula]

It remains to extend this inequality from rational h and k to real h and k. Indeed, let [formula] with h  <  k. Choose, as we may by the density of the rationals in the reals, sequences [formula] and [formula] such that lim n  →    ∞hn  =  h and lim n  →    ∞kn  =  k. Then for n sufficiently large hn  <  kn, hence [formula] by [\eqref=eqn:_difference_quotient_inequality_for_nonzero_rational_h_and_k]. Taking limits as n tends to infinity and using Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (iv) we have [formula], which completes the proof.

Remark

Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_has_nondecreasing_difference_quotient] is equivalent to the statement that ax is a convex function of x provided that a is a positive real number.

For [formula], the function x  ↦  ax is differentiable at 0.

Let [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (vi) it will suffice to show that [formula] exists. In fact, by Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_has_nondecreasing_difference_quotient] the nonempty set [formula] is bounded below, for instance by [formula]. Therefore [formula] exists and is finite. Again by Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_has_nondecreasing_difference_quotient], [formula] exists and equals [formula]. We have

[formula]

where we have used Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] parts (i), (iv) and (vi). Therefore [formula] exists and equals [formula], hence [formula] exists, as required.

Define the function [formula] by [formula].

For a  >  0, ax is continuously differentiable in x at every [formula]. Moreover for all [formula],

[formula]

Let a  >  0 and let [formula]. We have

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (i). By Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_is_differentiable_at_zero] the limit on the left hand side exists and equals ln a. Since x0 is arbitrary, [formula] exists everywhere and obeys equation [\eqref=eqn:_the_derivative_of_a^x_is_ln_a_times_a^x]. The continuity of the derivative now follows from equation [\eqref=eqn:_the_derivative_of_a^x_is_ln_a_times_a^x] and Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (iv).

For a  >  0, ln a varies continuously with a and is nondecreasing in a.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_x^a] parts (i) and (ii) ah is strictly decreasing in a  >  0 given a fixed h  <  0, and ah is strictly increasing in a  >  0 given a fixed h  >  0. It follows that, for a fixed [formula], [formula] is strictly increasing in a  >  0. Therefore [formula] is nondecreasing in a  >  0, as required. Fixing a0  >  0 it follows that lim a  →  a-0 ln a exists and equals sup 0  <  a  <  a0 ln a and that lim a  →  a+0 ln a exists and equals inf a  >  a0 ln a. However, by Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_has_nondecreasing_difference_quotient] we have [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

where we have also used Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_x^a] part (iii). Similarly, we show that lim a  →  a+0 ln a  =   ln a0. Indeed, by Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_has_nondecreasing_difference_quotient] we have [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

where we have used again Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_x^a] part (iii). Therefore lim a  →  a0 ln a exists and equals ln a0, so ln a is continuous at a0. Since a0  >  0 is arbitrary, the Theorem is proved.

There is a unique real number e  >  0 such that ln e  =  1. Moreover 2  <  e  <  3.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_has_nondecreasing_difference_quotient] we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

By the Intermediate Value Theorem and Theorem [\ref=thm:_the_slope_of_a^x_at_x_=_0_varies_continuously_and_increasingly_with_a_>_0] there exists some real number e∈(2,3) such that ln e  =  1. Now suppose that there is some b  >  0 with the property that ln b  =  1. Then by the quotient rule and equation [\eqref=eqn:_the_derivative_of_a^x_is_ln_a_times_a^x], [formula]. Therefore ex  =  Cbx for some [formula]. Setting x  =  0 and applying Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (vi) shows that C  =  1, hence ex  =  bx for all [formula] and in particular by Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (v) e  =  e1  =  b1  =  b. Therefore e is unique.

By equation [\eqref=eqn:_the_derivative_of_a^x_is_ln_a_times_a^x] and Theorem [\ref=thm:_the_existence_of_e] we have the following.

For [formula], [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] parts (iii), (vii) and (viii), ax is strictly monotone and maps [formula] onto [formula], provided [formula]. Therefore for such a, the function [formula] is invertible.

For [formula], [formula] and [formula] we define the logarithm to base a, [formula] by log ax  =  y if and only if ay  =  x.

For a  >  0  ln a  =   log ea.

Let a  >  0. By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (ii), ax  =  (elog ea)x  =  ex log ea. By equation [\eqref=eqn:_the_derivative_of_a^x_is_ln_a_times_a^x], Theorem [\ref=thm:_the_existence_of_e] and the Chain Rule we have

[formula]

and the result follows on dividing both sides by ax.

The function [formula] is called the Natural logarithm. It is sometimes also called the Napierian logarithm, although this is misleading - Napier's logarithm tables were not in fact tables of logarithms to base e [\cite=Edwards_book]. In view of Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (iii) the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:_the_slope_of_a^x_at_x_=_0_varies_continuously_and_increasingly_with_a_>_0] can be strengthened:

ln a is strictly increasing in a  >  0.

For [formula] the logarithmic function x  ↦   log ax is differentiable for all x  >  0, and [formula].

Let a  >  0, a  ≠  1. By Theorem [\ref=thm:_a^x_is_continuously_differentiable_everywhere] and Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (vii) the derivative of ax with respect to x exists everywhere and is continuous and nonzero. Therefore for x  >  0, by the Inverse Function Theorem and equation [\eqref=eqn:_the_derivative_of_a^x_is_ln_a_times_a^x] log ax is continuously differentiable and

[formula]

In particular by Theorem [\ref=thm:_our_ln_is_the_logarithm_to_base_e], Theorem [\ref=thm:_derivative_of_log_a_x] and Theorem [\ref=thm:_the_existence_of_e] we have the following.

For x  >  0, [formula].

The following integral is used in "Late Transcendental Functions" editions of Calculus textbooks as the definition of ln x.

For x  >  0, [formula].

By the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Corollary [\ref=cor:_derivative_of_ln_x], Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (vi) and Theorem [\ref=thm:_our_ln_is_the_logarithm_to_base_e].

The following limit is sometimes used as the definition of ex, in which case the existence of the limit must be proved by means different from ours.

[formula].

Let [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (ii) and Theorem [\ref=thm:_our_ln_is_the_logarithm_to_base_e] we have

[formula]

The limit, as t tends to infinity, of the left-hand side of the equation below has the indeterminate form ∞    ·  0, so we write it as a fraction and apply L'Hopital's rule:

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm:_basic_properties_of_a^x] part (iv) and equations [\eqref=eqn:_exponential_formula_for_(1_+_x/t)^t] and [\eqref=eqn:_application_of_L'Hopital's_Rule] we have [formula]. The result follows on replacing t  >  0 by [formula].

The following Taylor-Maclaurin series is often used as the definition of ex, in which case the convergence of the series for all [formula] must be proved differently than it is proved here (for instance by the Ratio Test.)

For all [formula]

[formula]

By Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange form for the remainder and Theorem [\ref=thm:_the_existence_of_e] and Corollary [\ref=cor:_e^x_is_its_own_derivative], for all [formula] and all [formula]

[formula]

for some ξ between 0 and x. But

[formula]

and this bound on the remainder term tends to zero as n tends to infinity. Indeed, if [formula] is such that N  +  1  >  |x|, then for n  >  N
