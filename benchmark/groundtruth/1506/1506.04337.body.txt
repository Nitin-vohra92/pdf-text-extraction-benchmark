On Frobenius numbers for Symmetric (not Complete Intersection) Semigroups Generated by Four Elements

Introduction

Bresinsky [\cite=be752] has shown that symmetric numerical semigroups [formula] which are not complete intersection (CI), have the first Betti number Î²1 = 5, i.e., its Hilbert series [formula] reads,

[formula]

where gcd (d1,d2,d3,d4) = 1 and di > 4; the latter is necessary since the numerical semigroup [formula] is never symmetric [\cite=f11].

Denote the k-th power symmetric polynomials in five variables [formula] for short by Ik and write two polynomial identities derived in [\cite=fel09], formula (6.11),

[formula]

In the present paper we show that relations ([\ref=x2]) allow to find a strong lower bound to the Frobenius number [formula] of symmetric (not CI) semigroup [formula].

Consider elementary symmetric polynomials [formula] in five variables

[formula]

which are related to each other by inequalities [\cite=har59],

[formula]

Make use of the Newton recursion identities for symmetric polynomials Ir and Jr

[formula]

and write explicit expressions for the three first of them, m = 1,2,3,

[formula]

Substitute ([\ref=x6]) into ([\ref=x2]) and rewrite the latter identities in Jr polynomials,

[formula]

Combine two identities: ([\ref=x7]) and [formula] in ([\ref=x4]), and get

[formula]

Thus we arrive at the first inequality in ([\ref=x4]) and inequality ([\ref=x8]),

[formula]

Inequality ([\ref=x9]a) holds always while inequality ([\ref=x9]b) is valid not for every c. In order to make both inequalities consistent we have to find such range of c where both inequalities ([\ref=x9]) are satisfied for any c within the range. A simple analysis shows that it can be provided iff

[formula]

The last expression leads immediately to the lower bound [formula] of the Frobenius number of symmetric (not CI) semigroup generated by four elements,

[formula]

If the values of generators are not large dj  ~  10 then the bound ([\ref=x11]) is very close to the exact value of [formula], e.g., for symmetric not CI numerical semigroups treated in [\cite=de76] [\cite=bfs14] [\cite=fel09] we have

[formula]

However, for large generators dj > 100 such proximity is broken. We present the Hilbert series and Frobenius number of symmetric not CI numerical semigroup [formula] found by author,

[formula]

This phenomenon is known for nonsymmetric numerical semigroups [formula] generated by three elements. The lower bound [formula] of Frobenius number for these semigroups was found in [\cite=ro90] [\cite=da94] and improved slightly in [\cite=fel06], [formula], e.g.,

[formula]

We finish by comparison the bound ([\ref=x11]) with two other lower bounds of Frobenius numbers for symmetric CI [\cite=fel09] [formula] and nonsymmetric [\cite=kil00] [formula] semigroups generated by four elements,
