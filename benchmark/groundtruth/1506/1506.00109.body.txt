Introduction

In this paper, we consider solutions of an integral equation driven by the following nonlocal, linear operator of convolution type:

[formula]

Here we suppose that k is an even, measurable kernel with normalization

[formula]

and such that

[formula]

for any [formula], for some fixed M0  ≥  m0 > 0 and R0  ≥  r0 > 0.

We consider here solutions u of the semilinear equation

[formula]

In the past few years, there has been an intense activity in this type of equations, both for its mathematical interest and for its relation with biological models, see, among the others [\cite=25] [\cite=26] [\cite=32] [\cite=34]. In this case, the solution u is thought as the density of a biological species and the nonlinearity f is often a logistic map, which prescribes the birth and death rate of the population. In this framework, the nonlocal diffusion modeled by L is motivated by the long-range interactions between the individuals of the species.

The goal of this paper is to study the symmetry properties of solutions of [\eqref=EQ] in the light of a famous conjecture of De Giorgi arising in elliptic partial differential equations, see [\cite=EDG]. The original problem consisted in the following question:

Let u be a bounded solution of

[formula]

in the whole of [formula], with Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional, i.e. there exist [formula] and [formula] such that [formula], for any [formula], at least when [formula].

The literature has presented several variations of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG]: in particular, a weak form of it has been investigated when the additional assumption

[formula]

is added to the hypotheses.

When the limit in [\eqref=LIM] is uniform in the variables [formula], the version of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] obtained in this way is due to Gibbons and is related to problems in cosmology.

In spite of the intense activity of the problem, Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] is still open in its generality. Up to now, Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] is known to have a positive answer in dimension 2 and 3 (see [\cite=GG] [\cite=AC] and also [\cite=BCN] [\cite=AAC]) and a negative answer in dimension 9 and higher (see [\cite=DKW]).

Also, the weak form of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] under the limit assumption in [\eqref=LIM] was proved (up to the optimal dimension 8) in [\cite=S], and the version of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] under a uniform limit assumption in [\eqref=LIM] holds true in any dimension (see [\cite=F] [\cite=BBG] [\cite=BHM]).

Since it is almost impossible to keep track in this short introduction of all the research developed on this important topic, we refer to [\cite=FV] for further details and motivations.

Goal of this paper is to investigate whether results in the spirit of Conjecture [\ref=C:DG] hold true when the Laplace operator is replaced by the nonlocal, integral operator in [\eqref=OP]. We remark that symmetry results in nonlocal settings have been obtained in [\cite=CSM] [\cite=SV] [\cite=LV] [\cite=CS] [\cite=CC1] [\cite=CC2], but all these works dealt with fractional operators with a regularizing effect. Namely, the integral kernel considered there is not integrable, therefore the solutions of the associated equation enjoy additional regularity and rigidity properties. Also, some of the problems considered in the previous works rely on an extension property of the operator that bring the problem into a local (though higher dimensional and either singular or degenerate) problem.

In this sense, as far as we know, this paper is the first one to take into account integrable kernels, for which the above regularization techniques do not hold and for which equivalent local problems are not available.

In this note, we prove the following one-dimensional result in dimension 2:

Let u be a solution of [\eqref=EQ] in the whole of [formula], with [formula] and [formula]. Assume that

[formula]

Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2] relies on a technique introduced by [\cite=BCN] and refined in [\cite=AC], which reduced the symmetry property to a Liouville type property for an associated equation (of course, differently from the classical case, we will have to deal with equations, and in fact inequalities, of integral type, in which the appropriate simplifications are more involved).

For the existence of one-dimensional solutions of [\eqref=EQ] under quite general conditions, see Theorem 3.1(b) in [\cite=Bates].

The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2].

We observe that

[formula]

Now we let ui: = ∂xiu, for i∈{1,2}. In light of [\eqref=mono], we can define

[formula]

Also, fixed R > 1 (to be taken as large as we wish in the sequel), we consider a cut-off function τ: = τR∈C∞0(B2R), such that τ = 1 in BR and [formula], for some C > 0.

By [\eqref=EQ], we have that

[formula]

Accordingly,

[formula]

By subtracting these two identities and using [\eqref=DF:v], we obtain

[formula]

Now, we multiply by 2τ2v and we integrate. Hence, recalling [\eqref=R1], we conclude that

[formula]

By writing

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

In the same way, if we write

[formula]

we get that

[formula]

By [\eqref=XR-2] and [\eqref=XR-3], after a simplification we obtain that

[formula]

Now we notice that

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Thus, using this and [\eqref=XR-1], and recalling [\eqref=ASS-kernel] and the support properties of τ, we deduce that

[formula]

where

[formula]

We use the symmetry in the (x,y) variables and the substitution ζ: = x - y to see that

[formula]

for some C > 0, possibly depending on R0.

Moreover, making use of the Hölder Inequality, we see that

[formula]

Now we claim that

[formula]

for any (x,y)∈RR, for a suitable C > 0, possibly depending on R0. For this, fix x and let Ω: = BR0(x). Then we use the Harnack Inequality for integral equations (recall [\eqref=ASS-kernel], [\eqref=mono] and [\eqref=5bis], and see Corollary 1.7 in [\cite=Coville]), to obtain that

[formula]

which establishes [\eqref=HA].

From [\eqref=DF:v] and [\eqref=HA], we obtain that

[formula]

for some C > 0. Hence, by [\eqref=measure],

[formula]

for some C > 0. Therefore, recalling [\eqref=J22],

[formula]

Hence, since

[formula]

we can use the symmetric role played by x and y in [\eqref=J23] and obtain that

[formula]

up to renaming C > 0. So, we insert this information into [\eqref=J24] and we conclude that

[formula]

for some C > 0.

Since clearly [formula], we can simplify the estimate in [\eqref=J25] by writing

[formula]

In particular, since τ = 1 in BR,

[formula]

Since C is independent of R, we can send R  →    +    ∞   in this estimate and obtain that the map

[formula]

belongs to [formula].

Using this and the fact that RR approaches the empty set as R  →    +    ∞  , we conclude that

[formula]

Therefore, going back to [\eqref=J25],

[formula]

This and [\eqref=mono] imply that [formula] for any [formula]. Hence, recalling [\eqref=ASS-kernel], we have that v(x) = v(y) for any [formula] and any y∈Br0(x).

As a consequence, the set [formula] is open and closed in [formula], and so, by connectedness, we obtain that v is constant, say v(x) = a for some [formula]. So we define [formula] and we observe that

[formula]

Thus, if ω  ·  y = 0 then

[formula]

Therefore, if we set [formula] for any [formula], and we write any [formula] as

[formula]

with ω  ·  yx = 0, we conclude that

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2].

For completeness, we observe that a more general version of Theorem [\ref=DG-2] holds true, namely if we replace assumption [\eqref=mono] with a "stability assumption" in the sense of [\cite=AC]: the precise statement goes as follows:

Let u be a solution of [\eqref=EQ] in the whole of [formula], with [formula] and [formula]. Assume that there exists ψ > 0 which solves Then, u is necessarily one-dimensional.

Notice that, in this setting, Theorem [\ref=DG-2] is a particular case of Theorem [\ref=DG-2-STAB], choosing ψ: = ∂u2 and recalling [\eqref=5bis].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2-STAB] is like the one of Theorem [\ref=DG-2], with only a technical difference: instead of [\eqref=DF:v], one has to define, for i∈{1,2},

[formula]

Then the proof of Theorem [\ref=DG-2] goes through (replacing u2 with ψ when necessary) and implies that v is constant, i.e. ui = aiψ, for some [formula]. This gives that [formula], which in turn implies the one-dimensional symmetry of u.

Also, we think that it is an interesting open problem to investigate if symmetry results in the spirit of Theorems [\ref=DG-2] and [\ref=DG-2-STAB] hold true in higher dimension.
