Cyclic cellularity and active sums

Introduction

The group theoretical cellularization of a group G was developed by Rodrguez and Scherer in [\cite=rodsc] as an analogue in the category of groups of the cellularization of spaces. In recent years there have been important developments in the subject, as can be seen from [\cite=flor2], [\cite=farj] and [\cite=chac], as well as from other references in the introduction of [\cite=chac]. On the other hand, the notion of active sum appeared in a paper of Tom�s [\cite=tomasana] as a generalization of the direct sum of groups, but this time taking into account the mutual actions of the groups in question. In its present form, the active sum of an active family of subgroups of a group G can be defined as a certain colimit in the category of groups (see Section 1.1. in [\cite=sumasact] for details). Proving that a given group is the active sum of a family of subgroups is not an easy task, but many examples have been considered in [\cite=sumasact], [\cite=sumasact2] and [\cite=ours], dealing in particular with the question of when a given group can be recovered as the active sum of a family of cyclic subgroups.

It was during a talk about active sums at the EPFL, that Jérôme Scherer observed that the active sum of a family of subgroups of G seemed to share some nice properties with a cellular cover of G (compare for example Theorem 1 in [\cite=chac] with the definition of active sum, or Lemma 1.5 in [\cite=farj] with Lemma 1.5 in [\cite=sumasact]). We will see that being the active sum of a family of cyclic subgroups is in general a stronger condition than being cellular for a cyclic group. In Theorem [\ref=sumcel], we prove cellularity with respect to a cyclic group for the active sum S of a family of subgroups of G, subject to certain conditions. Using some results about cellularity we obtain two consequences of this, the first one is about the primes dividing the Schur multiplier of S and the second one regards the question of when an A-cellular group, with A cyclic, is (isomorphic to) the active sum of a family of cyclic subgroups. As a final consequence, we obtain a couple of examples of groups which are A-cellular for a cyclic group A.

Definitions and notation

For the active sum, we take the definition given in Section 1.2 of [\cite=sumasact], but we consider only families with the order given by equality. In this setting, the definition can be given as in Section 2.1 of [\cite=ours], that is:

We note that if the family is generating ([formula]), there is a surjective homomorphism φ:S  →  G; see Section 1.2 of [\cite=sumasact].

Observe that if G is a finite group, then the active sum of any family of distinct subgroups of G, closed under conjugation, is finite too.

We will take as our definition of an A-cellular group the one given in Definition 2.2 of [\cite=chac].

Cn-cellularity

a) Suppose that f:X  →  Y is a Cn-equivalence. Let x and x' be two elements of Xm such that f(x) = f(x'). If Cn is generated by g, then there are homomorphisms h1 and h2 from Cn to X satisfying h1(g) = x and h2(g) = x'. The previous equality implies fh1 = fh2, which implies h1 = h2 and so x = x'. Now, given an element y∈Ym we can define a homomorphism t:Cn  →  Y which sends g to y. But then there exists a homomorphism h:Cn  →  X such that t = fh. By taking x0 = h(g), we have that f(x0) = y. Finally, ym = 1 implies f(xm0) = f(1), but clearly xm0 is in Xn, since h(g) is, and f is injective on this set, so we must have xm0 = 1.

b) Suppose that G is a Cm-cellular group and let f:X  →  Y be a Cn-equivalence. We will show that f is a Cm-equivalence to obtain the result.

Let t1 and t2 be two homomorphisms from Cm to X and suppose ft1 = ft2. Since the images of t1 and t2 are contained in Xm, and by a) f is injective on this set, we have that t1 = t2. Now let h be a homomorphism from Cm to Y and suppose Cm is generated by g. Since the image of h is contained in Ym, there exists and element x∈Xm such that f(x) = h(g). But then we can define t':Cm  →  X by sending g to x and we have that ft' = h.

As explained in Section 1, the active sum in this case is the quotient of the free product [formula] by the normal subgroup R generated by elements of the form r- 11  ·  r2  ·  r1  ·  (rr12)- 1, where ri∈Fi∈F and rr12 denotes the conjugation in G. We have an epimorphism [formula].

Let f:X  →  Y be a Cn-equivalence and [formula]. Composition with τ gives a homomorphism [formula]. By Proposition 7.1 in [\cite=chac], the group [formula] is Cn-cellular. Hence there exists a homomorphism [formula] such that ft' = hτ. This implies ft'(r- 11  ·  r2  ·  r1  ·  (rr12)- 1) = 1, that is ft'(r- 11  ·  r2  ·  r1) = ft'(rr12). Now, t'(r- 11  ·  r2  ·  r1) and t'(rr12) are both in Xn, so by the injectivity of f on this set, we have t'(r- 11  ·  r2  ·  r1  ·  (rr12)- 1) = 1. This means that t' can be extended to t:S  →  X and we have ft' = ftτ = hτ. But τ is a surjective homomorphism so ft = h.

Now suppose t1 and t2 are two homomorphisms from S to X such that ft1 = ft2. Clearly, this gives ft1τ = ft2τ. Since [formula] is Cn-cellular this implies t1τ = t2τ, and we have t1 = t2.

By the previous theorem, S is Cn-cellular. This implies, by Corollary 4 in [\cite=chac], that H2(S) is Cn-constructible. But, using Proposition 4.3.1 of the same reference, one can show that if A and K are finite nilpotent groups, then K is A-constructible if and only if π(K)  ⊆  π(A). This gives us the result.

By the previous theorem, S is Cn-cellular. Then, S is Cn-generated, by Proposition 2.3 in [\cite=chac]. The result follows now from Corollary 5.4.3 in [\cite=chac].

Examples

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=sumcel], we have the following two examples.

Every Coxeter group is C2-cellular.

By Example 2.2.4 in [\cite=sumasact], every Coxeter group is the active sum of a family of subgroups of order 2.

Let n  ≥  3. The group [formula] is C3-cellular if it is not one of the following: [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula].

By Theorem 3.5 in [\cite=sumasact], each of these groups is the active sum of a family of subgroups of order 3.

These examples can also be obtained using Corollary 4 and Proposition 4.3.1 in [\cite=chac].
