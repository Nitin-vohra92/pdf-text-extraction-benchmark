A note on sequential warped product manifolds

An introduction

O'Neill and Bishop defined warped product manifolds to construct Riemannian manifolds with negative sectional curvature[\cite=Bishop:1969]. This notion plays some important roles in differential geometry as well as in physics[\cite=Apostolopoulos:2005] [\cite=AD1] [\cite=AD] [\cite=Berestovskii:2008] [\cite=Besse2008] [\cite=Ivancevic:2007] [\cite=Oneill:1983].

Doubly and multiply warped product manifolds are generalization of (singly) warped product manifolds[\cite=Dobbaro2005] [\cite=Unal2001A] [\cite=Unal:2001]. In this article, we define a new class of warped product manifolds, namely, sequential warped products where the base factor of the warped product is itself a new warped product manifold. Sequential warped products can be considered as a generalization of singly warped products. There are many space-times where base, fibre or both are expressed as a warped product manifolds [\cite=Stephani:2003]. First we introduce the new concept.

Let Mi,i = 1,2,3 be three Riemannian manifolds with metrics gi. Let f:M1  →  (0,  ∞  ) and :M1  ×  M2  →  (0,  ∞  ) be two smooth positive functions on M1 and M1  ×  M2 respectively. Then the sequential warped product manifold, denoted by [formula], is the triple product manifold [formula] furnished with the metric tensorThe functions f and [formula] are called warping functions. If (Mi,gi),i = 1,2,3 are all Riemannian manifolds, then the sequential warped product manifold [formula] is also a Riemannian manifold.

Let (Mi,gi),i = 1,2 be two ni  -  dimensional Riemannian manifolds and :M1  ×  M2  →  (0,  ∞  ) and f:M1  →  (0,  ∞  ) be two smooth functions. Then (n1 + n2 + 1) -  dimensional product manifold [formula] furnished with the metric tensor

[formula]

is a standard static space-time and is denoted by [formula] where I is an open, connected subinterval of [formula] and dt2 is the Euclidean metric tensor on I. Note that standard static space-times can be considered as a generalization of the Einstein static universe[\cite=AD1] [\cite=AD] [\cite=GES] [\cite=Besse2008] [\cite=Unal:2012]. Also, (n1 + n2 + 1) -  dimensional product manifold [formula] furnished with the metric tensor

[formula]

is a generalized Robertson-Walker space-time, where I is an open, connected subinterval of [formula] :I  →  (0,  ∞  ) is a smooth function, and dt2 is the Euclidean metric tensor on I.

In [\cite=Stephani:2003], there are many exact solutions of Einstein field equation where the space-time may be written of the form [formula] with metrics of the form [\ref=a] and [\ref=b].

If the warping function [formula] is defined only on M1, then we get the multiply warped product manifold [formula] with two fibres.

The multiply warped product manifold of the form M1  ×  f1M2  ×  f2M3 is the product manifold [formula] equipped with the metricwhere f1 and fi are positive functions defined on M1.

The warped product of the form [formula] furnished by the metricis called the iterated warped product manifold of the manifolds M1, M2 and M3. As a metric space, the iterated warped product manifold is equal to the sequential warped product [formula] where f = f1 and  = f1f2. Similarly, a sequential warped product [formula] with separable function [formula] is equal as a metric space to the iterated warped product manifold. Thus the sequential warped product manifold is a generalization of the iterated warped product manifold.

In this article we study some geometric concepts such as curvature, geodesics, killing vector fields and concircular vector fields on sequential warped products as a generalization of both multiply warped product manifolds and iterated warped manifolds. In section 2, we derive covariant derivative formulas for sequential warped product manifolds. Then we derive many curvature formulas such as Ricci curvature and scalar curvature formulas. In section 3, we derive a characterization of two disjoint classes of conformal vector fields on sequential warped product manifolds.

Curvature of Sequential Warped Product Manifolds

The covariant derivative formulas for sequential warped product manifold [formula] are given as follows.

Let [formula] be a sequential warped product manifold with metric [formula] and also let Xi,Yi [formula]. The

Now consider the Ricci curvature [formula] of a sequential warped product [formula].

Let [formula] be a sequential warped product manifold with metric [formula] and also let Xi,Yi,Zi [formula]. Then

F. Dobarro and E. Lamí Dozo, in [\cite=Dobarro:1987], established a relationship between the scalar curvature of a warped product M  ×  fN of Riemann manifolds and those ones of M and N. In the following theorem we derive a similar result for the sequential warped product manifold.

Let [formula] be a sequential warped product manifold with metric [formula] and also let Ri be the scalar curvature of the manifold Mi while R and [formula] are the scalar curvature of the products M = M1  ×  fM2 and [formula]. Thenwhere [formula] and [formula].

By applying the result in on [formula] we get thatwhere [formula]. Then we apply the same result on M1  ×  fM2 to getwhere [formula]. Then

i.e.

In [formula], as product manifold, a curve [formula] can be written as [formula] with [formula] the projections of α into Mi.

A curve [formula] on [formula] is a geodesic if

[formula] on M1

[formula] on M2

[formula] on M3

Then [formula] is regular hence we can suppose [formula] is an integral curve of Ti on Mi and so [formula] is an integral curve of T = T1 + T2 + T3. Thus

[formula]

Now we apply Proposition ([\ref=P1]) to get

This equation implies that

Killing vector fields

Killing vector fields have well-known geometrical and physical interpretations and have been studied for a long time by geometers and physicists on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Killing vector fields are vector fields on (pseudo-) Riemannian manifolds that preserve metric i.e. under the flew of a Killing vector field the metric does not change. The set of all Killing vector fields on a connected Riemannian manifold forms a Lie algebra over the set of real numbers. The number of independent Killing vector fields measures the degree of symmetry of a Riemannian manifold. This number is bounded above by the dimension of the isometry group of the standard sphere. On a compact manifold M equality is attained if and only if M is isometric to the standard sphere or the real projective space. The problem of existence and characterization of Killing vector fields is important in both geometry physics. For instance, in compact Riemannian manifolds negative Ricci curvature ensures the absence of nontrivial Killing vector fields. Moreover, non-positive Ricci curvature of M implies that any Killing vector field is parallel[\cite=Berestovskii:2008] [\cite=Besse2008] [\cite=Duggala:2005] [\cite=Ivancevic:2007] [\cite=Kuhnel:1997] [\cite=Operea:2008] [\cite=Shenawy:2015]

In [\cite=Unal:2012], the authors studied Killing vector fields of warped product manifolds specially in standard static space-times. They proves a global characterization of the Killing vector fields of a standard static space-time They proved a form of a Killing vector field on the space-time in terms of Killing vector fields of the product parts. Moreover, a characterization of the Killing vector fields on a standard static space-time with compact Riemannian parts and many other interesting results are given. In this section we study the concept of Killing vector fields on sequential warped product manifolds.

A vector field ζon a Riemannian manifold [formula] is Killing if

[formula]

where is the Lie derivative in direction of the vector field ζ. This is equivalent to say that ζ is Killing if

[formula]

for any vector fields [formula]. By symmetry of the above equation, ζ is Killing if

[formula]

for any vector fields [formula].

A vector field [formula] is Killing if

ζi is Killing on Mi, for every i = 1,2,3

[formula]

[formula]

The vector field [formula] is Killing by equation ([\ref=e1]) if and only iffor any vector fields [formula]. It is clear that

[formula]

Now using Proposition ([\ref=P1]) we have

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

From this equation one can easily get the result.

The following result will enable us to discuss the converse of the above result.

A vector field [formula] satisfies

[formula]

for any vector fields [formula].

Let [formula] be a Killing vector field. Then

ζ1 is Killing on M1,

ζ2 is conformal on M2 with conformal factor [formula],

ζ3 is conformal on M3 with conformal factor [formula].

Consider equation ([\ref=e4]). We have the following cases

and thus ζ2 is conformal.

and thus ζ3 is conformal.

Let [formula] be a Killing vector field. Then [formula] is constant along the integral curve [formula] of X if

[formula] on M1

[formula] on M2

[formula] on M3.

The conditions (1-3) imply that [formula] is a geodesic and so [formula](see Theorem [\ref=TH1]). Thus

[formula]

i.e. [formula] is constant along the integral curve of X.

A vector field ζ on a Riemannian manifold M is called concircular vector field iffor any vector field X where μ is function defined on M. It is clear that

[formula]

i.e. any concircular vector field is a conformal vector field. Concircular vector fields have many applications in geometry and physics[\cite=Chen2014].

Let [formula] be a concircular vector field on [formula]. Then each ζi is a non-zero concircular vector field on Mi if and only if both f and [formula] are constant functions.

Using the definition of concircular vector fields and the Theorem [\ref=P1], we get that

[formula]

Suppose that both f and [formula] are constant functions, the

[formula]

Now, suppose that both f and [formula] are constant functions, then

[formula]

i.e. each ζi is concircular on Mi for i = 1,2,3. Now, suppose that

[formula]

Then equations [\ref=a1] becomes

[formula]

[formula]

These equations are true for any arbitray vector field X. Let X3 = 0 in the equation [\ref=b3], thenSince ζ3 = 0, [formula] for any vector field X1 + X2 and so [formula] is constant. Now, equations [\ref=b1] and [\ref=b2] become

[formula]

Similarly, we can prove that f is constant.

The converse of the above result is considered in the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a vector field on [formula]. Then ζ  =  ζ1 is a concircular vector field if ζ1 is a concircular vector field with factor [formula]

Note that a vector field u∂t an open connected interval I with the Euclidean metic is concircular with [formula]. Now we can use the above theorem to get the following result.

Let [formula] be a generalized Robertson-Walker (n1 + n2 + 1) -  dimensional space-time furnished with the metric tensor [formula] where I is an open, connected subinterval of [formula] :I  →  (0,  ∞  ) is a smooth function, and dt2 is the Euclidean metric tensor on I. Then ζ = u∂t is a concircular vector field on [formula] if [formula] is constant and [formula]. Moreover, [formula].
