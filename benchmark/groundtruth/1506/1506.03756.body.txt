Quantum entanglement has always been a key ingredient ever since its inception and fundamentally motivates in fulfilling several tasks in the domain of quantum information processing. Such tasks involve Teleportation [\cite=bennett701993], Dense coding [\cite=bennett691992], Secret sharing [\cite=hillery591999], Quantum cryptography [\cite=bennett1751984] and many others. Ideally, using pure maximally entangled state, like singlet state ([formula]) ,one would always expect to perform such tasks with high degree of fidelity. But due to de-coherence effect of nature, one encounters with mixed entangled state mostly. Werner state [\cite=werner401989] is a maximally entangled mixed state and in [formula] dimension the state has already been proved to be a useful resource in teleportation while the average optimal teleportation fidelity corresponding to this state exceeds classical teleportation fidelity [formula] [\cite=lee842000]. Another important class of maximally entangled mixed states is by Munro et. al [\cite=munro642001]. We have already shown that, Munro class can be used as a faithful teleportation channel only when the mixedness of the state is less than some specific value whereas for all fnite degrees of mixedness average optimal teleportation fidelity of Werner state exceeds that of Munro class [\cite=adhikari102010]. Those states which achieve the greatest possible entanglement for a given degree of mixedness are basically known as maximally entangled mixed states but the states which cannot be categorized in this way are called non-maximally entanglement mixed states (NMEMS). One of the examples of NMEMS is Werner derivative [\cite=hiroshima622000] which was also shown to be useful as teleportation channel obviously depending on some specific choices of state parameters. In our paper we further constructed another NMEMS, which as teleportation channel was shown to outperform the Werner derivative state (obviously for some parameter specifications). [\cite=adhikari102010] The proposed two qubit NMEMS was defined as follows [\cite=adhikari102010].

[formula]

where ρGab    =    Tr  c(|GHZ〉abc) (a separable density matrix) and ρWab    =    Tr  c(|W〉abc) (an inseparable density matrix). |GHZ〉abc and |W〉abc are known as GHZ state [\cite=ghzstate] and W state [\cite=wstate] respectively. The state ([\ref=nmems1]) is shown to be entangled when 0    ≤    p    <    0.292 but is useful in teleportation only when 0    ≤    p    ≤    0.25 . The state however cannot be used in teleportation when 0.25    <    p   < 0.292, although it remained entangled over there [\cite=adhikari102010]. As we know that the pivotal ingredient for performing teleportation task is accentuated by quantum entanglement, the existence of entanglement is however authenticated by its detection by means of entanglement witness. An observable Wt is called entanglement witness if (i) Tr(Wt  ϱs)    ≥    0 for all separable ϱs and (ii) Tr(Wt  ϱe)    <    0 for at least one entangled ϱe. It is also a known fact that for each entangled state ϱe there exists an entanglement witness detecting it [\cite=guhnereview]. Ganguly et. al investigated another aspect of this interesting facet of witness. They proved the existence of teleportation witnesses which signifies whether an unknown entangled state (pure or mixed) could be used as a resource in teleportation [\cite=ganguly1072011]. A hermitian operator Ws may be called a teleportation witness if the following conditions are satisfied (a) Tr(Ws  σ)    ≥    0, for all states σ which are not useful for teleportation, (b) Tr(Ws  χ)    <    0, for at least one state χ which is useful for teleportation. For [formula] dimensional system the teleportation witness proposed by Ganguly et. al is

[formula]

where [formula]. . The motivation for this revisit to our proposed class of NMEMS is to look for a suitable teleportation witness which will further validate the observational inference attained about the state ([\ref=nmems1]) regarding its feasibility in teleportation. In computational basis the state ([\ref=nmems1]) is expressed as

[formula]

The witness defined in ([\ref=nmems2]) cannot detect the applicability of the state ([\ref=nmems1]) in teleportation as it is found that [formula], (here d = 2). The characteristics of GHZ and W states are that they respectively are two qubit separable and inseparable states when a qubit is lost from the corresponding three qubit states. We, therefore, construct a witness in the following way.

[formula]

In this case, we find that [formula]. The witness is able to detect about the state ρnmems only when 0    ≤    p    <    0.142857. On the other hand the witness operator if were considered in the form of [formula], would fail to detect. It has been shown in [\cite=guhnereview] that, a witness for genuine multi-partite entanglement around the state |W〉abc would be of the form [formula], while a witness of the form [formula] would exclude full separability. We have found that if a witness of the form [formula] is taken, it fails to detect anything (whether the presence of entanglement or the usefulness in teleportation) about the NMEMS ρnmems. But if we construct a witness of the following form

[formula]

then it is observed that [formula] and hence the witness successfully detects the entanglement of the state ρnmems for 0    ≤    p    <    0.2857 and this observation tallies with our earlier inference shown in [\cite=adhikari102010]. But as we know that our constructed state is not useful for teleportation when p  ∈  (  0.25,  0.292  ), witness ([\ref=nmems5]) is an entanglement witness but cannot be considered as a bona fide teleportation witness for the state ([\ref=nmems1]). One of the witnesses, which are very convenient for experiments, are known as stabilizer witnesses [\cite=guhnereview] [\cite=furusawabook]. We construct one such witness which is defined as,

[formula]

where, σx, σy are Pauli spin matrices. In computational basis the witness ([\ref=nmems6]) can be expressed as,

[formula]

It is observed that, [formula] which is negative only when [formula] (i.e. 0    ≤    p    <    0.25). Thus, the witness ([\ref=nmems7]) is the more sought-after as it detects the entanglement of the state ([\ref=nmems1]) as well as its usefulness in teleportation. Hence ([\ref=nmems7]) can be considered to be the teleportation witness with respect to the state ([\ref=nmems1]). It is known that, Even though, the quantum correlations violate Bell's inequality, they satisfy weaker inequalities of a similar type. We will now look into our constructed state ([\ref=nmems1]) from another perspective. From the view point of Cirelson's bound [\cite=cirelson41980]. Recently, Poh et. al proved that, satisfying the Cirelson's bound can also be used to certify that the state under consideration is a maximally entangled state [\cite=poh1152015]. In this respect it is to be noted that the constructed NMEMS ([\ref=nmems1]) reduces to the form

[formula]

which is maximally entangled as it can be put into Ishizaka and Hiroshima proposed class of MEMS (Maximally Entangled Mixed States) [\cite=adhikari102010] [\cite=ishizaka622000]. We, therefore, would like to study NMEMS in the light of Cirelson's bound. Let us consider a bipartite mixed state whose density matrix is denoted by ρ (say). Then one can define the Bell operator [\cite=horodecki2001995] associated with quantum CHSH inequality with respect to the state ρ as

[formula]

where â, [formula] and [formula], [formula] are four random dichotomic variables representing measurements of spin in directions â, [formula], [formula], [formula] respectively and which are unit vectors in R3. Here, [formula], σi's are the Pauli spin matrices (i = x,y,z). to compute the expected value 〈BCHSH〉ρ and to maximize it, a pair of unit and mutually orthogonal vectors (,  ) are introduced by the following relations.

[formula]

In terms of spherical polar coordinates system one can consider  = ( sin ξ   cos η, sin ξ   sin η, cos ξ) and ( sin ξ/   cos η/, sin ξ/   sin η/, cos ξ/). The angles ξ, η, ξ/ and η/ are the parameters on which the observable Bmax is dependent [\cite=horodecki2001995], where,

[formula]

Here Tρ is a real matrix whose elements are represented as

[formula]

and [formula] is the Euclidean norm in R3. Then using ([\ref=nmems10]), ([\ref=nmems11]) and ([\ref=nmems12]), 〈Bmax〉 for the state ρnmems is given by

[formula]

, where the assumptions ξ  =  ξ/ and η  =  η/ have been made. With this assumption, it is found that 〈Bmax〉ρnmems is independent of η (ξ) but dependent on the parameter ξ (η) and the matrix Tρnmems is represented by,

[formula]

Below we plot 〈Bmax〉ρnmems against the parameters ξ and p. When the measurement angle ξ is set to [formula], the plot of 〈Bmax〉ρnmems versus the state parameter p is shown below. It is clear from the figure that 〈Bmax〉ρnmems attains the maximum bound of [formula] when p  =  1. We have already shown that our constructed state ([\ref=nmems1]) is useful for teleportation only when 0  ≤  p < 0.25 and the optimal teleportation fidelity of this state is given as follows,

[formula]

We express 〈Bmax〉ρnmems in terms of teleportation fidelity fTopt  (ρnmems) and therefore using ([\ref=nmems13]) and ([\ref=nmems15]) we have,

[formula]

Next we plot 〈Bmax〉ρnmems versus fTopt  (ρnmems) which is shown below. To summarize, we have designed an entanglement as well as teleportation witness operator for our constructed non-maximally entangled mixed state. An analysis on the attainment of Cirelson's bound by the NMEMS has been made. Also a relation between teleportation fidelity of the state and its expected value of the Bell operator has been obtained. In future, such analysis on the class of non-maximally entangled mixed state may be generalized to higher dimensions.
