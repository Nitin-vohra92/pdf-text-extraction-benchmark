Introduction

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over GF(q), q any prime power. The set S(V) of all subspaces of V, or subspaces of the projective space PG(V), forms a metric space with respect to the subspace distance defined by [formula]. In the context of subspace codes, the main problem is to determine the largest possible size of codes in the space (S(V),ds) with a given minimum distance, and to classify the corresponding optimal codes. The interest in these codes is a consequence of the fact that codes in the projective space and codes in the Grassmannian over a finite field referred to as subspace codes and constant-dimension codes, respectively, have been proposed for error control in random linear network coding. An (n,M,d;k)q constant-dimension subspace code (CDC) is a set C of k-subspaces of V with |C| = M and minimum subspace distance ds(C) =  min {ds(U,U')|U,U'∈C,U  ≠  U'} = d. The smallest open constant-dimension case occurs when n  =  6 and k  =  3. From a projective geometry point of view it translates in the determination of the maximum number of planes in PG(5,q) mutually intersecting in at most one point. In [\cite=HKK], the authors show that the maximum size of a binary subspace code of packet length n = 6, minimum subspace distance d = 4 and constant dimension k = 3 is M = 77. Therefore the maximum number of planes in PG(5,2) mutually intersecting in at most one point is 77. In the same paper, the authors, with the aid of a computer, classify all (6,77,4;3)2 subspace codes into 5 isomorphism types [\cite=HKK] and a computer-free construction of one isomorphism type [\cite=HKK] is provided. This last isomorphism type is then generalized to any q providing a family of (6,q6 + 2q2 + 2q + 1,4;3)q subspace codes [\cite=HKK]. In [\cite=CP1] the authors provided a construction of families of (6,q6 + 2q2 + 2q + 1,4;3)q subspace codes potentially including the infinite family constructed in [\cite=HKK].

In this paper we construct a family of (6,q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3 + (q2 + 1)(q2 + q + 1),4;3)q CDC. Our approach is purely geometric and the construction relies on the geometry of quadrics of a projective plane PG(2,q). More precisely, we use the correspondence between quadrics of PG(2,q) and points of PG(5,q). In this setting, we show that a special net of conics (circumscribed bundle) yields a (6,q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3,4;3)q CDC admitting the linear group PGL(3,q) as an automorphism group. Although the size of such a code asymptotically reaches the theoretical upper bound of a (6,M,4;3)q CDC [\cite=HKK], it turns out that it can be enlarged. This is done in the second part of the paper where we are able to find a set of further (q2 + 1)(q2 + q + 1) planes of PG(5,q) mutually intersecting in at most one point and extending the previous code. The (6,q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3 + (q2 + 1)(q2 + q + 1),4;3)q CDC so obtained admits the normalizer of a Singer cyclic group of PGL(3,q) as an automorphism group.

The Veronese embedding

Let PG(2,q) the Desarguesian projective plane of order q. A quadric of PG(2,q) is the locus of zeros of a quadratic polynomial, say a11X21 + a22X22 + a33X23 + a12X1X2 + a13X1X3 + a23X2X3. There are six parameters associated to such a curve and hence the set of quadrics of PG(2,q) forms a 5-dimensional projective space. There exist four kinds of quadrics in PG(2,q), three of which are degenerate (splitting into lines, which could be in the plane PG(2,q2)) and one of which is non-degenerate [\cite=JWPH1].

The Veronese map v defined by

[formula]

is the correspondence between plane quadrics and the points of PG(5,q),

The quadrics in PG(2,q) are:

q2 + q + 1 repeated lines;

(q2 + q + 1)(q + 1)q / 2 quadrics consisting of two distinct lines of PG(2,q) (bi-lines);

(q2 + q + 1)(q - 1)q / 2 quadrics consisting of two distinct conjugate lines of PG(2,q2) (imaginary bi-lines).

q5 - q2 non-degenerate quadrics (conics).

We will say that a bi-line or an imaginary bi-line is centered at A if its lines meet in the point A.

When q is even, all tangent lines to a conic C pass through a point of PG(2,q) called the nucleus of C.

It is not difficult to see that a quadric of PG(2,q) is degenerate if and only if its parameters satisfy the polynomial

[formula]

when q is even and

[formula]

when q is odd.

Notice that from [\cite=HT] the image of the Veronese map v is the dual of the image of the map ζ defined in [\cite=HT].

The group G: = PGL(3,q) acts on PG(2,q) and so it also acts naturally on the plane quadrics, and hence also on PG(5,q). The four sets of quadrics described above are G-orbits. With a slight abuse of notation we will denote by G the group PGL(3,q) acting on PG(5,q). We will denote by Oi, i = 1,2,3,4 the images under v in PG(5,q) of the four types of quadrics, respectively. It turns out that O1 is the Veronese surface when q is odd and a plane (called degenerate Veronese surface) when q is even. The orbits Oi, i = 1,2,3, partition the cubic hypersurface S of PG(5,q) with equation P1 = 0 when q is even and with equation P2 = 0 when q is odd.

It should be noted that under the map v a k-dimensional linear system of quadrics of PG(2,q) corresponds to a (k - 1)-dimensional projective subspace of PG(5,q). This means that pencils, nets and webs of quadrics, are represented by lines, planes and solids of PG(5,q), respectively.

Let us fix a point A of PG(2,q). The q + 1 lines passing through A considered as repeated lines, the q(q + 1) / 2 bi-lines centered at A and the q(q - 1) / 2 imaginary bi-lines centered at A form a net that under the Veronese map v corresponds to a plane πA contained in S and meeting O1 at q + 1 points forming either a conic (q odd) or a line (q even). Hence, there is a set N of q2 + q + 1 such planes. Also, through a point [formula] there passes exactly one plane of N whereas through a point of O1 there pass q + 1 planes of N . It follows that two distinct planes in N meet in a point of O1.

Let us fix two distinct points of PG(2,q), say A and B. Let [formula] be the line joining A and B. There are q2 + q bi-lines of PG(2,q) containing [formula]. These bi-lines together [formula] (considered as a repeated line) form a net that under the Veronese map v corresponds to a plane [formula] contained in S and tangent to O1. Hence, there is a set T of q2 + q + 1 such planes. Also, through a point P∈O2 there pass exactly two planes of T whereas through a point P∈O1 there passes exactly one plane of T. It follows that two distinct planes in T meet in a point of O2.

Circumscribed bundles

There exists a collection of q2 + q + 1 conics in PG(2,q) that mutually intersect in exactly one point, and hence serve as the lines of another projective plane on the points of PG(2,q). Such a collection of conics is called a projective bundle of PG(2,q). For more details on projective bundles, see [\cite=BBEF].

Let us embed PG(2,q) into PG(2,q3), and let σ be the period 3 collineation of PG(2,q3) fixing PG(2,q). Let us fix a triangle T of vertices P, Pσ, Pσ2 in PG(2,q3). Up to date, the known types of projective bundles are as follows [\cite=DGG], [\cite=DGG1]:

circumscribed bundle consisting of all conics of PG(2,q) containing the vertices of T. This exists for all q;

inscribed bundle consisting of all conics of PG(2,q) that are tangent to the three sides of T. This exists for all odd q;

self-polar bundle consisting of all conics of PG(2,q) with respect to which T is self-polar. This exists for all odd q.

From [\cite=BBEF] the conics of a circumscribed bundle form a net.

A cyclic group of G permuting points (lines) of PG(2,q) in a single orbit is called a Singer cyclic group of G. A generator of a Singer cyclic group is called a Singer cycle.

A Singer cyclic group of G has order q2 + q + 1 and its normalizer in G turns out to be a metacyclic group of order 3(q2 + q + 1). For more details, see [\cite=huppert].

All these projective bundles are invariant under the normalizer of a Singer cyclic group of G.

Let B be a circumscribed bundle of PG(2,q). We will need the following result, which extends [\cite=CP1].

Consider two distinct conics C0,C∞ of a circumscribed bundle B. If q is even, their nuclei are distinct. If q is odd, for a point P∈PG(2,q) the polar lines of P with respect to C0 and C∞ are distinct.

If q is even or if q is odd and [formula] then the result follows from [\cite=CP1]. Assume that q is odd and [formula]. Let r0 and r∞ be the polar lines of P with respect to C0 and C∞, respectively. By way of contradiction let r0 = r∞. If P∈C0 then P∈r0 but [formula], a contradiction.

Let A0,A∞, be the symmetric 3  ×  3 matrices associated to C0 and C∞, respectively. Let [formula] be the pencil generated by C0 and C∞. We have that the quadrics of F are the conics (non degenerate quadrics) of B through [formula] and they cover all points of PG(2,q) . Let [formula] denote the polarity associated with the conic in Cλ∈F. The product [formula] is then a projectivity of PG(2,q) fixing P whose associated matrix is A- t0A∞, where t denotes transposition. In other terms (A- t0A∞)(Pt) = ρPt, for some [formula]. Analogously, [formula] is a projectivity of PG(2,q) whose associated matrix is A- t0(A0  +  λA∞) and fixing P. Indeed, (A- t0(A0  +  λA∞))(Pt) = (I + λA- t0A∞)(Pt) = Pt  +  λρPt = (1 + λρ)(Pt). It turns out that [formula] if and only if [formula] if and only if [formula] for every [formula]. Let [formula] such that P∈Cλ0. Then [formula] and hence P∈r0, a contradiction.

Notice that if q is odd then the projectivity obtained as the product of two polarities associated to distinct conics of a circumscribed bundle is fixed point free.

Since B is stabilized by the normalizer N of a Singer cyclic group S of G that is maximal in G [\cite=BHR] we get that BG has size q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3.

From [\cite=RF] the group G has three orbits on points and lines of PG(2,q3). The orbits on points are the q2 + q + 1 points of PG(2,q), the (q3 - q)(q2 + q + 1) points on lines of PG(2,q3) that are not in PG(2,q) and the remaining set E of q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) points of PG(2,q3). The G-orbits on lines are the q2 + q + 1 lines of PG(2,q), the (q3 - q)(q2 + q + 1) lines meeting PG(2,q) in a point and the set L of q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) lines external to PG(2,q). The group N fixes a triangle T whose vertices are points of E and whose edges are lines of L.

We will need the following lemma.

Let TG be the orbit of T under G. If T1 and T2 are distinct elements of TG then the union of their vertices always contains a 5-arc, i.e., 5 points of π no three of which are collinear.

The stabilizer of T in G contains N that is maximal in G and hence |TG| = q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3. Let us consider the incidence structure whose points are the points of E and whose blocks are the vertex sets of the triangles of TG. The incidence relation is containment. It turns out that through a point of E there pass exactly one triangle of TG. Analogously, let us consider the incidence structure whose points are the lines of L and whose blocks are the edge sets of the triangles of TG. The incidence relation is containment. It turns out that through a line of L there exists exactly one triangle of TG having that line as an edge. As a consequence, the union of two triangles of TG always contains a 5-arc of π.

Two distinct circumscribed bundles of BG share at most one conic.

Let B1 and B2 be two distinct circumscribed bundles in BG. Let Ti be the triangle associated to Bi, i = 1,2. By way of contradiction assume that C1 and C2 are distinct conics in [formula]. Then C1 and C2, considered as conics of π, contain the vertices of both triangles T1 and T2. From Lemma [\ref=5arc] and from [\cite=JWPH1] we get a contradiction.

Under the Veronese map v the circumscribed bundles in BG correspond to a set C of q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3 planes of PG(5,q) mutually intersecting in at most one point. Since no quadric in a bundle is degenerate, a plane of C is always disjoint from S.

Two special webs of quadrics

Firstly, we recall some basic properties of three-dimensional non-degenerate quadrics.

A hyperbolic quadric Q+(3,q) of PG(3,q) consists of (q + 1)2 points of PG(3,q) and 2(q + 1) lines that are the union of two reguli. A regulus is the set of lines intersecting three skew lines and has size q + 1. Through a point of Q+(3,q) there pass two lines belonging to different reguli. A plane of PG(3,q) is either secant to Q+(3,q) and meets Q+(3,q) in a conic or it is tangent to Q+(3,q) and meets Q+(3,q) in a bi-line.

An elliptic quadric Q-(3,q) of PG(3,q) consists of q2 + 1 points of PG(3,q) such that no three of them are collinear. A plane of PG(3,q) is either secant to Q-(3,q) and meets Q-(3,q) in a conic or it is tangent to Q-(3,q) and meets Q-(3,q) in a point. For more details on hyperbolic and elliptic quadrics in a three-dimensional projective space we refer to [\cite=JWPH].

Let P1,P2 be two distinct points of PG(2,q). Since G is 2-transitive on points of PG(2,q) we can always assume that P1 = (1,0,0) and P2 = (0,1,0). The set of quadrics of PG(2,q) passing through P1 and P2 are those having the coefficients a11 = a22 = 0 and forms a web W. Under the Veronese map v, W corresponds to the solid v(W) with equations X1 = X2 = 0. The solid v(W) intersects S into the set of points satisfying the equations X4(2X5X6 - X3X4) = 0 and X4(X5X6 - X3X4) = 0 accordingly as q is odd or even, respectively. In both cases, this set consists of a hyperbolic quadric Q and a plane tangent π to Q at the point R = (0,0,1,0,0,0). In particular, π meets Q at 2q + 1 points forming a bi-line centered at R. The point R corresponds to the repeated line P1P2 and the remaining 2q points correspond to the bi-lines of W centered at P1 and P2. It is easily seen that the number of such solids (hyperbolic solids) is q(q + 1)(q2 + q + 1) / 2.

Assume that P1,P2 are points of [formula] conjugate over GF(q). Since G is transitive on points of [formula] we can assume that P1 = (1,α,0) and so P2 = (1,αq,0), where α is a primitive element of GF(q2) over GF(q). Again, the set of quadrics of PG(2,q2) passing through P1 and P2 are those whose coefficients satisfy a11  =  αq + 1a22 and a12 =  - (α  +  αq)a22 and forms a web U . Under the Veronese map v, U corresponds to the solid v(U) with equations X1  =  αq + 1X2 and X4 =  - (α  +  αq)X2. The solid v(U) intersects S into the set of points satisfying the equations X2(X26  +  αq + 1X25 + (α  +  αq)X5X6 + ((α  +  αq)2  -  αq + 1)X2X3) = 0 and X2((α  +  αq)2X2X3  +  αq + 1X26 + (α  +  αq)X5X6 + X25) = 0 accordingly as q is odd or even, respectively. Notice that the polynomial X2 + (α  +  αq)X + αq + 1 is irreducible over GF(q) and that, if q is odd, αq + 1 is a nonsquare element of GF(q). Therefore, in both cases, this set consists of an elliptic quadric Q' and a plane π tangent to Q' at the point R = (0,0,1,0,0,0). In this case, the number of such solids (elliptic solids) is q(q - 1)(q2 + q + 1) / 2.

The plane π is contained in S, belongs to T and meets O1 at the point R.

In the sequel a hyperbolic or elliptic solid will be denoted by Σ = (τ,Q) where τ∈T is contained in Σ and Q is the three-dimensional hyperbolic or elliptic quadric contained in [formula]. We will denote by H and E the set of hyperbolic solids and elliptic solids, respectively.

Now, we do investigate how two solids (elliptic or hyperbolic) can intersect.

Let Σ1 = (π1,Q1), Σ2 = (π2,Q2) be two distinct hyperbolic solids. Then, one of the following cases occur:

[formula] is a plane, π1  =  π2 and [formula];

[formula] is a plane, π1  =  π2 and [formula];

[formula] is a plane, [formula] and [formula];

[formula] is a line, [formula] and [formula];

Let us assume that Σi corresponds to the web defined by the points Ai,Bi, i = 1,2. Let [formula] be the line AiBi, i = 1,2.

The pairs A1,B1 and A2,B2 share a point and [formula]. Then we can assume that A2 = B1. In this case it is clear that π1  =  π2 and the q + 1 points of [formula] correspond to the bi-lines centered at A2 = B1 of the relevant webs together with [formula] considered as a repeated line.

The pairs A1,B1 and A2,B2 share no point and [formula]. In this case it is clear that π1  =  π2 and the point of [formula] corresponds to [formula] considered as a repeated line.

The pairs A1,B1 and A2,B2 share the point [formula]. In this case the planes π1 and π2 share only the point corresponding to the bi-line [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] contains the q + 1 points corresponding to the bi-lines centered at a point of the line A1B2 and containing the line A1B2 and the line through A2. Also, [formula] contains the point corresponding to the bi-line [formula].

The pairs A1,B1 and A2,B2 share no point and [formula].

[formula].

In this case π1 and π2 share only the point corresponding to the bi-line [formula]. Here, [formula] consists of the two points corresponding to the bi-line [formula] centered in A1 and the bi-line [formula] centered at B2. The line joining the points of [formula] lies on π1.

The points A1,B1,A2,B2 form a 4-arc in PG(2,q). In this case π1 and π2 share only the point corresponding to the bi-line [formula]. Here, [formula] consists of the two points corresponding to the bi-line containing the linesA1A2 and B1B2 and the bi-line containing A1B2 and A2B1.

[formula]. In this case by switching [formula] and [formula] we are again in the case 4.1.

Let Σ1 = (π1,Q1), Σ2 = (π2,Q2) be two distinct elliptic solids. One of the following cases occur:

[formula] is a plane, π1  =  π2 and [formula];

[formula] is a line, [formula] and [formula];

Let us assume that Σi corresponds to the web defined by the points Ai,Aqi, i = 1,2. Let [formula] be the line AiAqi, i = 1,2.

Assume that [formula]. In this case it is clear that π1  =  π2 and that the unique intersection point between Q1 and Q2 corresponds to the repeated line [formula].

Assume that [formula]. In this case π1 and π2 share a unique point corresponding to the bi-line [formula]. Here [formula] consists of the two points corresponding to the two imaginary bi-lines containing the lines A1A2, Aq1Aq2 and A1Aq2, Aq1A2, respectively.

Two special nets of quadrics

As already observed, the Singer cyclic group S permutes the points (lines) of PG(2,q) in a single orbit. Under the action of S, the set of q(q + 1)(q2 + q + 1) / 2 bi-lines of PG(2,q) is partitioned into q(q + 1) / 2 orbits of size q2 + q + 1. Let us fix one of the q(q + 1) / 2 orbits of bi-lines, say b, and let us consider the incidence structure whose points are the lines of PG(2,q) and whose blocks are the bi-lines of b. It turns out that a line [formula] is contained in exactly two bi-lines, say b1 and b2, of b centered at two distinguished points of [formula], say A1 and A2, respectively. Let s be the unique element of S such that As1  =  A2. Then bs1  =  b2.

Let PA1 and PA2 be the pencils of lines with vertices A1 and A2. Clearly, s is a projectivity sending PA1 to PA2 that does not map the line [formula] onto itself. In [\cite=steiner] it is proved that the set of points of intersection of corresponding lines under s is a conic C passing through A1 and A2 (Steiner's argument). The projectivity s maps the tangent line to C at A1 onto the line [formula] and the line [formula] onto the tangent line to C at A2. Moreover, for any two distinct points A and B of a conic there exists a projectivity ψ∈S sending A to B and such that C is the set of points of intersection of corresponding lines under ψ. Assume that [formula], i = 1,2. Since s sends [formula] to [formula] and [formula] to [formula], it follows that [formula] is tangent to C at Ai, i = 1,2. Embed PG(2,q) into PG(2,q3). We have denoted by T be the unique triangle of PG(2,q3) fixed by S. Considering PA1 and PA2 as pencils in PG(2,q3) and repeating the previous argument, a conic [formula] of PG(2,q3) passing through the vertices of T and containing C arises. It follows that C is a member of the circumscribed bundle B of PG(2,q) left invariant by S. Let [formula] and let b3 the bi-line of b centered at A3. Let s' be the unique element of S sending A1 to A3. Then bs'1 = b3. Steiner's argument with s replaced by s', applied to the pencils PA1 and PA3, gives rise to a conic C' that necessarily belongs to B. Furthermore, being unique the conic of B through two distinct points of PG(2,q) it follows that C = C'. Since As'1 = A3 and [formula] then [formula]. On the other hand, the point [formula] lies on C and of course it lies on [formula]. Since the line [formula] is tangent to C at A1 we have that [formula] is the point A1 or, in other words, [formula] is the line A1A3. Analogously, the point [formula] lies on C and of course it lies on [formula]. Therefore [formula] is either the line A1A2 or the line A1A3. Since [formula] it follows that [formula]. We have showed that b3 is the bi-line containing the lines A1A3 and A2A3.

We have proved the following Proposition.

For any conic C of B there exists two distinguished points P1 and P2 of C such that the elements of b centered at a point of C are as follows: tP1r, tP2r, r1r2, where tPi is the tangent line to C at Pi, i = 1,2, r is the line P1P2, ri is the line PPi, i = 1,2, and P ranges over [formula].

Notice that there exists a one to one correspondence between the orbits of S on bi-lines and secant lines to C.

With the notation introduced in Proposition [\ref=conics], notice that, from [\cite=JWPH1] the pencil generated by the bi-lines r1r2 and ru, where [formula] and [formula], contains exactly a further bi-line. Moreover, this bi-line is centered at a point of C. Indeed, let C be the conic with equation X1X3 - X22 = 0. The stabilizer of C in G is isomorphic to PGL(2,q) and acts 3-transitively on points of C. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume that P1 = (1,0,0), P2 = (0,0,1) and P3 = (1,1,1). Let vi be the line joining the point P3 and the point Pi, i = 1,2. Thenb3 = v1v2. Notice that [formula]. Let u be a line passing through U and containing none of the points Pi, i = 1,2,3. Let b4 be the bi-line uP1P2. Then [formula] consists of the four points P1,P2,(1,1,t),(1,t,t), with t  ≠  0,1. It turns out that the bi-line consisting of the lines (1,t,t)P2 and (1,1,t)P1 is centered at the point (1,t,t2)∈C.

The following Proposition could be of some interest.

The incidence structure whose points are the elements of b and whose lines are the conics of the circumscribed bundle B, where a bi-line is incident with a conic if it is centered at one of its points, forms a projective plane.

We have that |b|  =  |B|  =  q2 + q + 1. Since through a point of PG(2,q) there pass q + 1 conics of B, we have that a bi-line of b is incident with q + 1 conics of B. On the other hand a conic is incident with q + 1 bi-lines of b. In particular we have seen that to a conic C of B are associated two distinguished points P,Ps∈C, where s∈S and all the bi-lines of b incident with C contain both P,Ps. Let us consider now a conic of [formula]. Then it is necessarily of the form Cμ, for some non-trivial element μ∈S. Then two possibilities occur according as one of the points Pμ,Psμ does belong to C or does not. If the first case occurs then, assuming that Pμ is the point belonging to C, we have that [formula]. If tP denotes the tangent line to C at the point P, it turns out that tμP is the tangent line to Cμ at the point Pμ and tμP  =  PPμ. Therefore the unique bi-line of b incident with both C and Cμ is centered at Pμ. If the latter case occurs, then, by construction (a la Steiner) , [formula] is the unique point in common between C and Cμ. Therefore the unique bi-line of b incident with both C and Cμ is centered at [formula].

With the notation introduced in Proposition [\ref=conics] let us consider the three bi-lines tP1r, tP2r and r1r2, where [formula]. Under the map v they correspond to three points R1,R2,R3 of O2, respectively. From the classification of pencils of quadrics of PG(2,q) in [\cite=JWPH1] the line joining R1 and R2 corresponds to the unique pencil P whose members are all bi-lines and having a base consisting of q + 2 points. Hence the line R1R2 is completely contained in O2. In particular, the bi-lines of P are those containing the line r and the line [formula], where A ranges over r. It follows that the bi-line corresponding to R3 cannot belong to P. Let v(b) be the image of b under v. Of course v(b) contains Ri, i = 1,2,3. Let πe be the plane of PG(5,q) generated by R1,R2,R3 and let Πe denote the set of planes obtained in this way.

The plane πe meets O2 at 2q points consisting of the line R1R2 and of further q - 1 points. Also, the plane πe meets v(b) in q + 1 points containing R1,R2,R3. Indeed, from Remark [\ref=conf], through the point R3 there are q - 2 lines intersecting O2 in three points and v(b) in two points.

It follows that the points of [formula] correspond to the bi-lines of b centered at points of C. We have that |Πe| = q(q + 1)(q2 + q + 1) / 2

On the other hand, the plane πe is contained in the hyperbolic solid defined by the points P1,P2 and then [formula] consists of a conic and a line secant to it.

Since the number of hyperbolic solids equals |Πe| and each plane of Πe is contained in at least a hyperbolic solid, it follows that there exists a one to one correspondence between planes of Πe and hyperbolic solids.

Now, let S' be the unique Singer cyclic group of PGL(3,q2) containing S. It is clear that the circumscribed bundle B' of PG(2,q2) fixed by S' induces the circumscribed bundle B of PG(2,q) fixed by S.

Let b1' be the imaginary bi-line containing the lines r,rq and centered at the point P∈PG(2,q). Let C be a conic of B through P and let [formula] be the unique conic of B' containing C.

Let [formula] be the orbit of b1' under S'. As already observed above there exist two points, say P1,P2 on [formula] such that all elements of [formula] centered at a point of [formula] pass through P1 and P2. Also, since [formula] and the tangent line to C at P is a line of PG(2,q), it follows that [formula]. Under the action of S, [formula] is partitioned into q2 - q + 1 orbits of size q2 + q + 1. Among these, we denote by b' the unique S-orbit consisting of imaginary bi-lines. It turns out that a member of b' consists of the lines z = RP1 and zq = RP2 for some R∈C. Let R1,R2∈C, R1  ≠  R2. Let ri = RiP1 and rqi = RiP2, i = 1,2. Since [formula] it follows that [formula] and then P2 = Pq1.

Notice that the line P1P2 arises from a line a of PG(2,q) that is external to C. Let [formula], where tP1 and tP2 are the tangent lines to [formula] at P1 and P2, respectively. Then A∈PG(2,q). Indeed, when q is odd, A is the conjugate of a with respect to C. When q is even, A is the nucleus of both C and [formula].

For any conic C of B there exists two distinguished points P and Pq of [formula] not on C such that the elements of b' centered at a point of C are of the form XP,XPq, where X ranges over C.

Notice that there exists a one to one correspondence between the orbits of S on imaginary bi-lines and lines external to C.

Similar arguments used in Proposition [\ref=pp] give the following result.

The incidence structure whose points are the elements of b' and whose lines are the conics of the circumscribed bundle B, where an imaginary bi-line is incident with a conic if it is centered at one of its points, forms a projective plane.

Let di be the bi-line consisting of the lines a and DiA, i = 1,2, where D1,D2 are distinct points of a.

With the notation introduced in Proposition [\ref=conics1], let us consider two bi-lines of the form a,DiA, i = 1,2 and the imaginary bi-line XP,XPq, for some X∈C. Under the map v they correspond to three points R1,R2,R3, respectively. The points R1 and R2 are in O2, whereas R3∈O3. From the classification of pencils of quadrics of PG(2,q) in [\cite=JWPH1] the line joining R1 and R2 corresponds to the unique pencil P whose members are all bi-lines and having a base consisting of q + 2 points. Hence the line R1R2 is completely contained in O2. In particular, the bi-lines of P are those containing the line a and the line DA, where D ranges over a. Of course the imaginary bi-line corresponding to R3 cannot belong to P. Let v(b') be the image of b' under v. Of course v(b') contains Ri, i = 1,2,3. Let πi be the plane of PG(5,q) generated by R1,R2,R3 and let Πi denote the set of planes obtained in this way.

The plane πi meets O2 in the line R1R2 and O3 in further q + 1 points. Indeed, from the classification of pencils of quadrics of PG(2,q) in [\cite=JWPH1], through the point R3 there are q lines intersecting O3 in two points and O2 in one point. Each of these lines corresponds to the unique pencil consisting of q - 2 conics, a bi-line and two imaginary bi-lines. Also, there exists a unique line through the point R3 intersecting both O2, O3 in one point. Such a line corresponds to the unique pencil consisting of q - 1 conics one bi-line and one imaginary bi-line. It follows that the points of [formula] correspond to the imaginary bi-lines of b' centered at points of C. We have that |Πi| = q(q - 1)(q2 + q + 1) / 2

On the other hand, the plane πi is contained in the elliptic solid defined by the points P,Pq and then [formula] consists of a conic and [formula] of a line external to it.

Since the number of elliptic solids equals |Πi| and each plane of Πi is contained in at least an elliptic solid, it follows that there exists a one to one correspondence between planes of Πi and elliptic solids.

Lifting Singer cycles

Here, we assume that q is odd. From [\cite=huppert], we may assume that S is given by

[formula]

where ω is a primitive element of GF(q3) over GF(q). It follows that the lifting of S to a collineation of PG(5,q) fixing the Veronese surface O1 has the following canonical form A = diag(S2,Sq + 1) [\cite=BBCE].

The group 〈A〉 has order q2 + q + 1. Geometrically, 〈A〉 fixes two planes of PG(5,q) , say ρ1, ρ2, and partition the remaining points of PG(5,q) into Veronese surfaces, [\cite=BBCE]. In particular, the planes ρ1 and ρ2 are both full orbits of 〈A〉 and disjoint from the cubic hypersurface S [\cite=BCS].

From [\cite=BBCE] the cubic hypersurface S is partitioned under 〈A〉 into Veronese surfaces. The hypersurface S has (q2 + 1)(q2 + q + 1) points and hence it consists of q2 + 1 Veronese surfaces.

The construction of subspace codes

In this Section we prove our main result.

Two distinct planes of Πe can meet in at most one point.

Let σ1,σ2 be two distinct planes of Πe. From Section [\ref=nets] there exist uniquely determined hyperbolic solids Σ1 = (π1,Q1) and Σ2 = (π2,Q2) of H containing σ1 and σ2, respectively. Let [formula] be the conic in Σi, i = 1,2.

Assume first that c1,c2 belong to the same S-orbit. Then, from Proposition [\ref=pp], c1 and c2 share exactly one point. Since S permutes the planes of T in a single orbit we have that π1  ≠  π2. Therefore, from Proposition [\ref=mcsh], [formula] consists of either 2 or q + 2 points (q + 1 points on a line together with a further point Y). Assume that [formula] is a line. If [formula], then the conics c1 and c2 should share two points, a contradiction. If [formula], then it turns out that [formula]. On the other hand, since [formula], the line y contains Y and must be secant to both Q1 and Q2. Hence, again, the conics c1 and c2 should share two points, a contradiction.

Assume that c1,c2 do not belong to the same S-orbit. Then c1 and c2 have no point in common. Assume that [formula] is a line. If [formula] consists of either 2 or q + 1 or q + 2 points, then since [formula], from Proposition [\ref=mcsh], the conics c1 and c2 should share at least one point, a contradiction. If [formula], since [formula], then the line y either contains the point [formula] and, again, the conics c1 and c2 should share one point, a contradiction, or the line y is secant to both c1, c2 and [formula] consists of four distinct points. If this last case occurs, then, under the inverse of the map v, these four points correspond to four distinct bi-lines having in common q + 1 points of a line z and a further point Z∉z. In particular, let ci' denote the conic of the circumscribed bundle B locus of centers of the bi-lines corresponding to points of ci, i = 1,2. It turns out that c1'  ≠  c2' (see Remark [\ref=corr]) and z is the polar line of the point Z with respect to both c1' and c2', when q is odd or Z is the nucleus of both c1' and c2', when q is even. But this contradicts Lemma [\ref=bundle].

Two distinct planes of Πi can meet in at most one point.

Let σ1,σ2 be two planes of Πi. From Section [\ref=nets] there exist uniquely determined elliptic solids Σ1 = (π1,Q1) and Σ2 = (π2,Q2) of E containing σ1 and σ2, respectively. Let [formula] be the conic in Σi, i = 1,2.

Assume first that c1,c2 belong to the same S-orbit. Then, from Proposition [\ref=pp1], c1 and c2 share exactly one point. Since S permutes the planes of T in a single orbit we have that π1  ≠  π2. Therefore, from Proposition [\ref=mcse], [formula] consists of 2 points. Assume that [formula] is a line, then the conics c1 and c2 should share two points, a contradiction.

Assume that c1,c2 does not belong to the same S-orbit. Then c1 and c2 have no point in common. Assume that [formula] is a line. If [formula] consists of 2 points, then, since [formula], from Proposition [\ref=mcse], the conics c1 and c2 should share at least one point, a contradiction. If [formula], since [formula], then the line y either contains the point [formula] and, again, the conics c1 and c2 should share one point, a contradiction, or the line y  ⊂  O2 is external to both c1, c2. If this last case occurs, then, under the inverse of the map v, the points of y correspond to bi-lines having in common q + 1 points of a line z and a further point Z∉z. In particular let ci' denote the conic of the circumscribed bundle B locus of centers of the imaginary bi-lines corresponding to points of ci, i = 1,2. It turns out that c1'  ≠  c2' (see Remark [\ref=corr1]) and z is the polar line of the point Z with respect to both c1' and c2', when q is odd or Z is the nucleus of both conics c1' and c2', when q is even. But this, again, contradicts Lemma [\ref=bundle].

The set [formula] consists of q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3 + (q2 + 1)(q2 + q + 1) planes mutually intersecting in at most one point.

Assume that σ1∈C and [formula]. In this case σ1  ⊂  O4 and σ2 always contains a line in [formula] and hence if [formula] was a line then σ1 should contain a point of [formula].

Assume that [formula] and σ2∈N. In this case σ2  ⊂  S whereas σ1 meets S in the union of a conic and a line r. Hence if [formula] was a line, such a line should be r. From [\cite=JWPH1] the line r corresponds to the unique pencil of quadrics containing only bi-lines. On the other hand, a line of σ2 corresponds to a pencil of quadrics always containing imaginary bi-lines or at most q bi-lines.

Assume that σ1∈Πe and σ2∈Πi.

Let Σ1 = (π1,Q1) the unique hyperbolic solid of H containing σ1 and let Σ2 = (π2,Q2) the unique elliptic solid of E containing σ2. Notice that [formula] is always disjoint from [formula]. Let [formula] be the conic in Σi, i = 1,2. Assume that [formula] is a line r Since [formula] it follows that [formula]. Under the inverse of the map v, the points of r correspond to bi-lines having in common q + 1 points of a line z and a further point Z∉z. In particular, let ci' denote the conic of the circumscribed bundle B locus of centers of the (imaginary) bi-lines corresponding to points of c1 (c2). It turns out that z is secant to c1' and external to c2'. In particular, z is the polar line of the point Z with respect to both c1' and c2', when q is odd or Z is the nucleus of both conics c1' and c2', when q is even. But this, again, contradicts Lemma [\ref=bundle].

There exists a constant dimension subspace code K with parameters (6,q3(q2 - 1)(q - 1) / 3 + (q2 + 1)(q2 + q + 1),4;3)q.

The code K admits a group of order 3(q2 + q + 1) as an automorphism group. It is the normalizer of a Singer cyclic group of PGL(3,q).

We say that a constant dimension subspace code is complete if it is maximal with respect to set-theoretic inclusion. Some computer tests performed with MAGMA [\cite=magma] yield that our code is not complete when q = 3. Indeed there exist other 39 planes that can be added to our set. However, when q = 4,5 our code is complete. We conjecture that our code is complete whenever q  ≥  4.
