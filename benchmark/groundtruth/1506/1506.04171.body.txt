Introduction

In the 1940s, P. Erdös introduced the notion of a separable set of domains in the plane, which gained the attention of H. Hadwiger in [\cite=Hadwiger]. G.F. Tóth and L.F. Tóth extended this notion to totally separable domains and proved the densest totally separable arrangement of congruent copies of a domain is given by a lattice packing of the domains generated by the side-vectors of a parallelogram of least area containing a domain [\cite=Toth]. Totally separable domains are also mentioned by G. Kertész in [\cite=Kertesz], where it is proved that a cube of volume V contains a totally separable set of N balls of radius r with V  ≥  8Nr3. Further results and references regarding separability can be found in a manuscript of J. Pach and G. Tardos [\cite=Pach].

This manuscript continues the study of separability in the context of regular unit sphere packings, i.e., infinite sets of unit spheres

[formula]

in [formula] with [formula], whose contact graphs GP  =  (V,E), where [formula] and

[formula]

are regular (every vertex has equal degree); this means that every sphere in the packing touches the same number of spheres.

Let C(Pn) be the contact number of a unit sphere packing Pn with n spheres, i.e., the cardinality of the edge set of the contact graph GPn. Determining the maximum contact number of a unit sphere packing with n spheres is known as the contact number problem. The contact number problem for circle packings in [formula] was solved exactly in 1974 by H. Harborth in [\cite=Harborth] to be [formula] Upper and lower bounds on the contact number problem for finite packing of unit balls in [formula] were provided by K. Bezdek and the author in [\cite=Reid] and studied in detail up to n = 18 by M. Holmes-Cerfon in [\cite=Holmes-Cerfon] improving the lower bounds for some values. Consult [\cite=Bezdek] and references therein for more information regarding contact numbers of unit sphere packings and arrangements of spheres in higher dimensions.

A sphere packing P is totally separable if every tangent hyperplane to a pair of touching spheres has an empty intersection with the interior of all spheres in P.

The contact number problem for totally separable sphere packings is studied and all regular totally separable sphere packings in [formula], [formula], and [formula] based on convex uniform tessellations (classified in an unpublished manuscript of G. Olshevsky [\cite=Olshevsky]) are constructed. Now, let

[formula]

where [formula] is a measure on sphere packings called the separability of the packing which is defined formally in the appendix; intuitively, the separability of a packing is 0 if the packing is inseparable and 1 if it is totally separable. The theory of minimal area polyominoes developed in [\cite=Alonso] is used with Euler's formula to provide a proof of the contact number problem for totally separable circle packings:

[formula]

Furthermore, heuristics are provided for the upper bound on the contact number problem for totally separable sphere packings in [formula] which is based on the number of edges of polyominoes over the cubic d-honeycomb and hence exact when [formula]:

[formula]

As this manuscript was being prepared, K. Bezdek, B. Szalkai, and I. Szalkai proved the above upper bound on c(n,d) with an ingenious argument involving box-polytopes and the isoperimetric inequality [\cite=BezdekSz]. The paper ends with a construction of a family of regular totally separable sphere packings in [formula] that is not based on a convex uniform tessellation for d  ≥  3 and an outline of future research directions.

The most basic example of when the condition on a totally separable sphere packing is violated is explained in the form of a lemma for future reference.

If the contact graph GP of a sphere packing P in [formula] contains a k-simplex for 2  ≤  k  ≤  d, then P is not totally separable.

First consider the case where GP contains a 2-simplex and observe that it violates total separability. For, the tangent line generated by the touching circles associated with an edge e of the 2-simplex intersects the interior of the circle associated with the vertex which is not an endpoint of e. Proceed by induction, observing from the base case d = 2 that any k-simplex with 3  ≤  k  ≤  d in GP violates total separability as that k-simplex contains a 2-simplex somewhere in its flag, thus proving the lemma.

This lemma will be used extensively for classifying totally separable sphere packings based on convex uniform tesselations of [formula], also known as tilings or honeycombs.

Regular Totally Separable Circle Packings in [formula]

Regular totally separable circle packings in [formula] which are based on convex uniform tilings are classified by the following theorem.

There are exactly 4 convex uniform tilings in [formula] which generate totally separable circle packings:

P1 - Square tiling, {4,4,4}

P3 - Hexagonal tiling, {6,6,6}

K6 - Truncated square tiling, {4,8,8}

K9 - Omnitruncated trihexagonal tiling, {4,6,12}

Apply Lemma [\ref=triangle] to the list of 11 convex uniform tilings of [formula]; three Pythagorean tilings and eight Keplerian tilings [\cite=Olshevsky]. Clearly, if P is a 4-regular totally separable packing of unit circles in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tiling, then P is congruent to P1. If P is a 3-regular totally separable packing of unit circles in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tiling, then P is congruent to P3, K6, K9 or a subset of P1. If P is a 2-regular totally separable packing of unit circles in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tiling, then P is congruent to a subset of either P1, P3, K6, or K9.

The theory of minimal area polyominoes and Euler's formula is used to provide an exact solution to the contact number problem for totally separable circle packings; an alternative explicit proof, not relying on the results of [\cite=Alonso], which extends a proof technique of H. Harborth [\cite=Harborth] appears in [\cite=BezdekSz].

Given [formula], there exists a totally separable circle packing Pn in [formula] with contact number

[formula]

Furthermore, no totally separable circle packing in [formula] has a larger contact number.

By Euler's formula, n  -  (|E|  +  P(c))  +  a  =  2, where |E| is the cardinality of the edge set of the contact graph GPn, P(c) is the perimeter of the polyomino c with area a generated by placing n unit 2-cubes so that elements of Pn are incircles. Interpolate the piece-wise defined function from Corollary 2.5 of [\cite=Alonso] which provides the minimal perimeter of a polyomino of area a in order to obtain the desired formula.

Regular Totally Separable Sphere Packings in [formula]

Regular totally separable sphere packings in [formula] which are based on convex uniform honeycombs are classified by the following theorem.

There are exactly 7 convex uniform honeycombs in [formula] which generate totally separable sphere packings in [formula]:

J1 - Cubic honeycomb

J3 - Hexagonal prismatic honeycomb

J6 - Truncated square prismatic honeycomb

J9 - Omnitruncated trihexagonal prismatic honeycomb

J16 - Bitruncated cubic honeycomb

J18 - Cantitruncated cubic honeycomb

J20 - Omnitruncated cubic honeycomb

Apply Lemma [\ref=triangle] to N. Johnson's list of 28 convex uniform honeycombs [\cite=Johnson]. Clearly, if P is a 6-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform honeycomb, then P is congruent to J1. If P is a 5-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform honeycomb, then P is congruent to J3, J6, J9, or a subset of J1. If P is a 4-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform honeycomb, then P is congruent to J16, J18, J20, or a subset of either J1, J3, J6, or J9. If P is a 3-regular, or 2-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform honeycomb, then P is congruent to a subset of either J1, J3, J6, J9, J16, J18, or J20.

Regular Totally Separable Sphere Packings in [formula]

Regular totally separable sphere packings in [formula] based on convex uniform 4-honeycombs are classified by the following theorem.

There are exactly 18 convex uniform tetracombs in [formula] which generate totally separable sphere packings in [formula]:

O1 - Tesseractic tetracomb

O3 - Square-hexagonal duoprismatic tetracomb

O6 - Tomosquare-square duoprismatic tetracomb

O9 - Omnitruncated-trihexagonal-square duoprismatic tetracomb

O16 - Bitruncated-cubic prismatic tetracomb

O18 - Cantitruncated-cubic prismatic tetracomb

O20 - Omnitruncated-cubic prismatic tetracomb

O39 - Hexagonal duoprismatic tetracomb

O42 - Hexagonal-tomosquare duoprismatic tetracomb

O45 - Hexagonal-omnitruncated-trihexagonal duoprismatic tetracomb

O63 - Tomosquare duoprismatic tetracomb

O66 - Tomosquare-omnitruncated-trihexagonal duoprismatic tetracomb

O78 - Omnitruncated-trihexagonal duoprismatic tetracomb

O99 - Truncated icositetrachoric tetracomb

O100 - Great diprismatotesseractic tetracomb

O103 - Omnitruncated tesseractic tetracomb

O132 - Omnitruncated icositetrachoric tetracomb

O140 - Great-prismatodecachoric tetracomb

Apply Lemma [\ref=triangle] to G. Olshevsky's list of 143 convex uniform 4-honeycombs [\cite=Olshevsky]. Clearly, if P is a 8-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tetracomb, then P is congruent to O1. If P is a 7-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tetracomb, then P is congruent to O3, O6, O9, or a subset of O1. If P is a 6-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tetracomb, then P is congruent to O16, O18, O20, O39, O42, O45, O63, O66, O78, or a subset of either O1, O3, O6, or O9. If P is a 5-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tetracomb, then P is congruent to O99, O100, O103, O132, O140, or a subset of either O1, O3, O6, O9, O16, O18, O20, O39, O42, O45, O63, O66, or O78. If P is a 4-regular, 3-regular, or 2-regular totally separable packing of unit spheres in [formula] generated by a convex uniform tetracomb, then P is congruent to a subset of either O1, O3, O6, O9, O16, O18, O20, O39, O42, O45, O63, O66, O78, O99, O100, O103, O132, or O140.

The regularity of each 4-honeycomb is determined by inspecting the number of vertices of the vertex figure associated with the honeycomb, e.g., the vertex figure of O100 is an irregular pentachoron, implying that the 4-dimensional sphere packing generated by the great diprismatotessseractic tetracomb is 5-regular.

Totally Separable Sphere Packings in [formula]

Totally separable sphere packings in [formula] are studied and future research directions are outlined. The following heuristics for the upper bound to the contact number problem for totally separable sphere packings in [formula] provides a reasonable intuitive explanation of the following theorem.

From the formula for the number of m-cubes on the boundary of a d-cube for m = 1 observe that

[formula]

for n = 2d. Similarly, for any [formula] there is a [formula] d-cube with [formula] edges, implying that the upper bound in the following theorem is an equality. Assume that kd  <  n  <  (k + 1)d and observe that the upper bound on c(n,d) overestimates the supremum over edge cardinalities of (k + δ1)  ×  (k  +  δ2)  ×    ·    ·    ·    ×  (k  +  δd) unit polyominoes with n cells, where δi∈{0,1}.

For [formula],

[formula]

with equality when [formula].

Improving upon an earlier and lengthier unpublished case analytic proof, K. Bezdek, B. Szalkai, and I. Szalkai provide an elegant proof using box-polytopes and the isoperimetric inequality [\cite=BezdekSz].

The classification of uniform d-honeycombs is incomplete, leading to great difficulty in establishing the above characterizations of totally separable sphere packings in d = 2,3,4 for d  ≥  5. The ongoing work by J. Bowers, G. Olshevsky, N. Johnson, and others of classifying uniform polyterons will soon result in the complete classification of uniform 5-honeycombs, and the study of uniform polypetons generating uniform 6-honeycombs has only recently begun. For d  ≥  7 there appears to be no significant work on uniform honeycombs; although R. Klitzing has classified certain uniform polytopes up to d = 8 [\cite=Klitzing]. Future research on the topic of regular totally separable sphere packings should include a comprehensive construction of families of k-regular totally separable sphere packings in [formula] for 3  ≤  k  ≤  2d  -  1 and d  ≥  5. These are the unknown bounds on k-regularity because for k = 2 spheres can be placed along an apeirogon (infinite line with evenly spaced points) and for k = 2d spheres can be placed on the cubic d-honeycomb. For an example to motivate future research in this direction, a construction in [formula] of a (d + 1)-regular totally separable sphere packing which is not based on a convex uniform d-honeycomb for d  ≥  3 is presented. A similar construction would be desired for 3  ≤  k  ≤  d and d + 2  ≤  k  ≤  2d - 1; regardless of whether or not it is based on a convex uniform d-honeycomb.

There exists a (d + 1)-regular totally separable sphere packing in [formula] for d  ≥  3 which is not based on a convex uniform d-honeycomb.

Let [formula] be a unit d-cube in [formula] and place 2d unit d-cubes

[formula]

so that [formula] with xi,1 lying outside Qd0 along a line emanating from the centroid of Qd0 through x0,i for 1  ≤  i  ≤  2d. Now construct

[formula]

and iteratively place 2d - 1 unit d-cubes diagonally out of each existing unit d-cube Qd1,...,Qd2d as above so that spheres may be placed around their vertices which generate a packing congruent to P2d  +  4d. Indefinitely extending this procedure leads to an infinite totally separable sphere packing which is (d + 1)-regular. For, let [formula] be an arbitrary sphere in this packing and observe that it touches d other spheres placed on adjacent vertices of the unit d-cube which x is a vertex of, and also touches 1 other sphere which is diagonally outward as in the construction. Furthermore, for d = 2 this construction corresponds to the truncated square tiling K6 and for d  ≥  3 this construction corresponds to a scaliform which contains an elongated cubic bifrustum.

The classification of regular totally separable sphere packings which are not based on convex uniform 3-honeycombs is then a sub-problem of classifying all scaliforms (vertex-transitive honeycombs) in [formula]; from a simplex-free scaliform in [formula] one can construct a totally separable sphere packing by placing equal size spheres at the vertices. The questionable existence of aperiodic totally separable sphere packings in any dimension remains unexplored.

No aperiodic totally separable sphere packing exists in any dimension.

Appendix: Separability as a Geometric Measure

Separability is introduced as a geometric measure where inseparable sphere packings have a separability of 0 and totally separable sphere packings have a separability of 1. Let He denote the tangent hyperplane to a pair of touching spheres in [formula] associated with edge e of the contact graph GP  =  (V,E). First define the separability measure for finite sphere packings Pn with GPn  =  (Vn,En) by

[formula]

If a sphere packing [formula] can be constructed so that P  =   lim n  →    ∞Pn for some sequence of finite sphere packings Pn, then

[formula]

Observe that if every tangent hyperplane He at a contact point associated with the edge e intersects the interior of another sphere in the packing P then [formula] and similarly if none intersect the interior of a sphere in the packing then [formula]; in the former case P is called inseparable and in the latter case P is called totally separable.
