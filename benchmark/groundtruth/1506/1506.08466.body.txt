A Generalization of J-Quasipolar Rings

Lemma Proposition Corollary Definition Remark Example Examples

Introduction

Throughout this paper all rings are associative with identity unless otherwise stated. Let R be a ring. According to Koliha and Patricio [\cite=KP], the commutant and double commutant of an element a∈R are defined by comm(a) = {x∈R ~ | ~ xa = ax}, comm2(a) = {x∈R ~ | ~ xy = yx ~  ~ y∈comm(a)}, respectively. If Rqnil  =  {a∈R ~ | ~ 1 + ax∈U(R) ~  ~ x∈comm(a)} and a∈Rqnil, then a is said to be quasinilpotent (see [\cite=Ha]). The element a is called quasipolar if there exists p2  =  p∈R such that p∈comm2(a), a  +  p is invertible in R and ap∈Rqnil. Any idempotent p satisfying the above conditions is called a spectral idempotent of a, and this term is borrowed from spectral theory in Banach algebra and it is unique for a.

Quasipolar rings have been studied by many ring theorists (see [\cite=CC1], [\cite=GHH], [\cite=GHH1], [\cite=Ha], [\cite=KP] and [\cite=YC]). In [\cite=GHH1], the element a∈R is called nil-quasipolar if there exists p2 = p∈comm2(a) such that a + p is nilpotent, the idempotent p is called a nil-spectral idempotent of a. The ring R is said to be nil-quasipolar if every element of R is nil-quasipolar. Recently, J-quasipolar rings are studied in [\cite=CC3]. The element a is called J-quasipolar if there exists p2  =  p∈R such that p∈ comm2(a) and a  +  p∈J(R), p is called a J-spectral idempotent of a. The ring R is said to be J-quasipolar if every element of R is J-quasipolar. Motivated by these, we introduce a new class of quasipolar rings which is a generalization of J-quasipolar rings. By using δ-quasipolar rings, we extend some results of J-quasipolar rings.

An outline of the paper is as follows: The second section deals with δ-quasipolar rings. We prove various basic characterizations and properties of δ-quasipolar rings. We investigate conditions under which a δ-quasipolar ring is quasipolar and a quasipolar ring is δ-quasipolar (Corollary [\ref=abdelta] and Proposition [\ref=locquasi]). It is proven that every J-quasipolar ring is δ-quasipolar. We supply an example to show that all δ-quasipolar rings need not be J-quasipolar. Among others the δ-quasipolarity of Dorroh extensions and some classes of matrix rings are investigated. In Section 3, we introduce an upper class of δ-quasipolar rings, namely, weakly δ-quasipolar rings. We show that every direct summand of a weakly δ-quasipolar ring is weakly δ-quasipolar and every direct product of weakly δ-quasipolar rings is weakly δ-quasipolar, and we give some properties of such rings.

In what follows, [formula] and [formula] denote the ring of integers and the ring of rational numbers and for a positive integer n, [formula] is the ring of integers modulo n. For a positive integer n, let Matn(R) denote the ring of all n  ×  n matrices and Tn(R) the ring of all n  ×  n upper triangular matrices with entries in R. We write J(R) and nil(R) for the Jacobson radical of R and the set of nilpotent elements of R, respectively.

δ-quasipolar Rings

In this section we introduce the concept of δ-quasipolar rings and investigate some properties of such rings. We show that every quasipolar ring need not be δ-quasipolar (Example [\ref=aksi]). It is proven that every J-quasipolar ring is δ-quasipolar and the converse does not hold in general (see Example [\ref=ilki]). Among others we extend some results of J-quasipolar rings for this general setting.

A right ideal I of the ring R is said to be δ-small in R if whenever R = I + K with R / K singular right R-module for any right ideal K then R = K. In [\cite=Zh], the ideal δ(R) is introduced as a sum of δ-small right ideals of R. We begin with the equivalent conditions for δ(R) which is proved in [\cite=Zh] for an easy reference for the reader.

Given a ring R, each of the following sets is equal to δ(R).

R1 = the intersection of all essential maximal right ideals of R.

R2 = the unique largest δ-small right ideal of R.

R3  =  {x∈R|xR  +  KR  =  R implies KR is a direct summand of RR}.

[formula]ideals P of R|R / P has a faithful singular simple module}.

R5  =  {x∈R| for all y∈R there exists a semisimple right ideal Y of R such that [formula].

Now we give our main definition.

The following are examples for δ-quasipolar rings.

One may suspects that every quasipolar ring is δ-quasipolar. But the following example erases the possibility.

Let Sr denote the right socle of the ring R, that is, Sr is the sum of minimal right ideals of R. We now prove that the class of J-quasipolar rings is a subclass of δ-quasipolar rings.

If R is a J-quasipolar ring, then R is δ-quasipolar. The converse holds if Sr  ⊆  J(R).

The first assertion is clear since J(R)  ⊆  δ(R). Assume that R is δ-quasipolar. If Sr  ⊆  J(R), then J(R) / Sr = J(R / Sr) = δ(R) / Sr [\cite=Zh] and we have J(R) = δ(R). Hence, R is J-quasipolar.

The converse of Lemma [\ref=iki] is not true in general as the following example shows.

Let F be a field and consider the ring [formula]. Then R is a semisimple ring and R  =  δ(R) and J(R)  =  0. Hence R is δ-quasipolar and it is not J-quasipolar.

Let R be a ring. Then we have the following.

If a,u∈R and u is invertible, then a is δ-quasipolar if and only if u- 1au is δ-quasipolar.

The element a∈R is δ-quasipolar if and only - 1 - a is δ-quasipolar.

If R is a δ-quasipolar ring with δ(R)  =  J(R), then the spectral idempotent for any invertible element in R is the identity of R.

(1) Assume that a is δ-quasipolar. Let p2  =  p∈comm2(a) such that a  +  p∈δ(R). Let x∈comm(u- 1au). Then (uxu- 1)a = a(uxu- 1). Since p∈comm2(a), (uxu- 1)p = p(uxu- 1). Hence (u- 1pu)2  =  u- 1pu∈comm2(u- 1au). Since δ(R) is an ideal of R, u- 1(a + p)u  =  u- 1au  +  u- 1pu∈δ(R). Thus u- 1au is δ-quasipolar. Conversely, if u- 1au is δ-quasipolar, then by the preceding proof u(u- 1au)u- 1  =  a is δ-quasipolar. (2) Assume that a is δ-quasipolar. Let p2  =  p∈comm2(a) such that a  +  p  =  r∈δ(R). Then - 1 - a + (1 - p) =  - r∈δ(R). Then 1 - p∈comm2( - 1 - a) and 1 - p is the spectral idempotent of - 1 - a. Conversely, if - 1 - a is δ-quasipolar, then from what we have proved that - 1 - ( - 1 - a)  =  a is quasipolar. (3) Let u be an invertible element in R. There exists p2  =  p∈comm2(u) such that u  +  p∈δ(R). Then 1  +  u- 1p∈J(R). Hence u- 1p and so p is invertible. Thus p  =  1.

In [\cite=CC3], it is proved that if R is a J-quasipolar ring, then 2∈J(R). In this direction we prove the following.

If R is a δ-quasipolar ring, then 2∈δ(R).

For the identity 1, there exists p2  =  p∈R such that 1  +  p∈δ(R). Multiplying the latter by p, we have 2p∈δ(R). Hence 1 - p∈δ(R). Thus 2∈δ(R).

Lemma [\ref=ucin] can be used to determine whether given rings are δ-quasipolar.

Our next endeavor is to find conditions under which a δ-quasipolar ring is quasipolar or vice versa. In this direction recall that a ring R is called local if it has only one maximal left ideal, equivalently, maximal right ideal.

Let R be a local ring. If R is quasipolar ring, then R is δ-quasipolar.

Let a∈R. If a∈J(R), it is clear. Assume that a∉J(R). Since R is local, a is invertible. Hence a + 1∈δ(R) by δ(R) = J(R).

A ring R is called right principally projective if every principal right ideal is a direct summand. Principally projective rings were introduced by Hattori [\cite=Hat] to study the torsion theory and play an important role in ring theory.

Every δ-quasipolar ring is right principally projective.

Assume that R is a δ-quasipolar ring. Let a∈R. By Lemma [\ref=ucin], 2∈δ(R) and - 1 - a∈δ(R). Then 2  +  ( - 1 - a)  =  1 - a∈δ(R). By [\cite=Zh], there exists a semisimple right ideal Y of R such that [formula].

Recall that a ring R is said to be von Neumann regular if for any a∈R, there exists b∈R with a  =  aba, while R is strongly regular if for any a∈R, there exists b∈R with a  =  a2b. In this direction we prove the following.

Every abelian δ-quasipolar ring is strongly regular.

Let a∈R. By Theorem [\ref=peh], there exists a semisimple projective right ideal such that [formula]. Then 1  =  e  +  f where e2  =  e∈aR and f2  =  f∈Y. So eR  ⊆  aR and a  =  ea  +  fa. Hence a  =  ea∈eR. Thus aR  =  eR. It follows that R is von Neumann regular. Since R is abelian, R is strongly regular.

The following result is an immediate consequence of Lemma [\ref=strpireg].

Every abelian δ-quasipolar ring is quasipolar.

A ring R is said to be clean [\cite=NC] if for each a∈R there exists e2  =  e∈R such that a - e is invertible, and R is called strongly clean [\cite=Ni] provided that every element of R can be written as the sum of an idempotent and an invertible element that commute.

Every abelian δ-quasipolar ring is strongly clean.

The converse statement of Corollary [\ref=strclean] need not hold in general.

In [\cite=CC3], it is shown that if the ring R is J-quasipolar, then R / J(R) is Boolean and idempotents in R / J(R) lift R. We have the following result for δ-quasipolar rings.

If R is a δ-quasipolar ring, then R / δ(R) is a Boolean ring and idempotents in R / δ(R) lift R.

Let [formula]. There exists p2  =  p∈comm2( - 1 + a) such that - 1 + a  +  p∈δ(R). Hence [formula] is an idempotent in R / δ(R) and R / δ(R) is a Boolean ring. Let ā2  =  ā∈R / δ(R). Then a2  -  a∈δ(R). There exists p2  =  p∈comm2(a) such that a  +  p∈δ(R). Multiplying a  +  p∈δ(R) from the right by p we have

[formula]

Multiplying a  +  p∈δ(R) from the left by a we have

[formula]

Substract (1) from (2), we have a2  -  p∈δ(R). Hence a - p∈δ(R) and so idempotents in R / δ(R) lift to R.

The concept of δr-clean rings are defined in [\cite=GO]. A ring R is called δr-clean if for every element a∈R there exists an idempotent e∈R such that a  -  e∈δ(R). A ring is abelian if all idempotents are central.

If R is a δ-quasipolar ring, then it is δr-clean. The converse holds if R is abelian.

Let R be a δ-quasipolar ring and a∈R. There exists p2  =  p∈comm2( - 1 + a) such that - 1 + a  +  p∈δ(R). Then a - (1 - p)∈δ(R). For the converse, assume that R is abelian. Let a∈R. There exists an idempotent e such that 1  +  a - e∈δ(R). By assumption, 1 - e is a central idempotent and so 1 - e∈comm2(a).

Recall that a ring R is exchange if for every a∈R, there exists an idempotent e∈aR such that 1 - e∈(1 - a)R. Namely, von Neumann regular rings and clean rings are exchange.

Let R be a δ-quasipolar ring. Then

R is an exchange ring.

R / δ(R) is a clean ring.

(1) Let R be a δ-quasipolar ring. By Lemma [\ref=sait], R is a δr-clean ring. By [\cite=GO], every δr-clean ring is an exchange ring.(2) By Theorem [\ref=besli1], R / δ(R) is Boolean, therefore, it is clean.

Consider following conditions for a ring R.

R is δ-quasipolar and δ(R)  =  0.

R is Boolean.

R is von Neumann regular and δ-quasipolar.

Then ⇒   ⇒   .

(1) ⇒   (2) Assume that R is δ-quasipolar and δ(R)  =  0. By Theorem [\ref=besli1], R is Boolean. (2) ⇒   (3) Assume that R is Boolean. Then it is commutative with characteristic 2 and a2  +  a  =  0∈δ(R) and a2  =  a  =  a3 for all a∈R. Hence R is von Neumann regular and δ-quasipolar.

Let R be a ring. The element a∈R is called J-clean if a is the sum of an idempotent and a radical element in its Jacobson radical. The ring R is called J-clean if every element is a sum of an idempotent and a radical element.

If R is an abelian J-clean ring, then it is δ-quasipolar.

Let a∈R. Then we have - a∈R. Since R is J-clean, there exist e2 = e∈R and j∈J(R) such that - a  =  e  +  j. Hence a + e∈J(R). Since R is abelian, e2 = e∈comm2(a) and J(R)  ⊆  δ(R), R is δ-quasipolar as asserted.

All δ-quasipolar rings need not be Boolean and the converse statement of Theorem [\ref=mete] is not true in general.

In [\cite=CC3], it is shown that a ring R is local and J-quasipolar if and only if R is J-quasipolar with only trivial idempotents if and only if [formula]. We have the following for δ-quasipolar rings.

Let R be a ring with only trivial idempotents. Then R is δ-quasipolar if and only if [formula] or [formula].

Assume that R is δ-quasipolar. Let a∈R. There exists an idempotent p∈comm2(a) such that - a + p∈δ(R). By hypothesis p  =  1 or p  =  0. If δ(R)  =  0, then [formula]. Suppose that δ(R)  ≠  0. For any [formula], ā  =  ∈R / δ(R). Hence [formula]. Conversely, if [formula], there is nothing to do. Suppose that R / δ(R) is isomorphic to [formula] by isomorphism f. Let [formula]. Then [formula]. Then [formula] implies [formula] Kerf  =  0. Hence [formula]. That is, a  +  1∈δ(R). Thus R is δ-quasipolar.

Recall that a ring R is called strongly π-regular if for every element a of R there exist a positive integer n (depending on a) and an element x of R such that an  =  an + 1x, equivalently, an element y of R such that an  =  yan + 1. In spite of the fact that J(R) is contained in both δ(R) and Rqnil, no comparings between δ(R) and Rqnil exist. Strongly π-regular rings play crucial role in this direction.

Let R be a δ-quasipolar ring and δ(R) = J(R). Then R is strongly π-regular if and only if J(R) = Rqnil  =  nil(R) = δ(R).

Necessity. Let a∈Rqnil. Then for any x∈comm(a), 1 - ax is invertible. By hypothesis, there exist a positive integer m and b∈R such that am  =  am + 1b. Since b∈comm(a) by [\cite=La], am  =  0. So a∈nil(R) or Rqnil  ⊆  nil(R). To prove nil(R)  ⊆  δ(R), let a∈nil(R). By hypothesis there exists p2  =  p∈comm2(1 - a) such that 1 - a + p∈δ(R). Since 1 - a is invertible, p  =  1 by Lemma [\ref=inv] (3). Hence 2 - a∈δ(R). Also 2∈δ(R) by Lemma [\ref=ucin], we then have a∈δ(R).

Sufficiency. Let a∈R. There exists p2  =  p∈comm2( - 1  +  a) such that - 1  +  a  +  p∈δ(R). Set u =  - 1  +  a  +  p∈nil(R). Then a  +  p is invertible and ap  =  up is nilpotent so that anp  =  0 for some positive integer n. So an  =  an(1 - p)  =  (u  +  (1 - p))n(1 - p)  =  (u  +  1)n(1 - p)  =  (a  +  p)n(1 - p)  =  (1 - p)(a  +  p)n. By Nicholson, [\cite=Ni], a is strongly π-regular. This completes the proof.

Let R and V be rings and V be an (R,R)-bimodule that is also a ring with (vw)r  =  v(wr), (vr)w  =  v(rw), and (rv)w  =  r(vw) for all v, w∈V and r∈R. The Dorroh extension D(R,V) of R by V defined as the ring consisting of the additive abelian group [formula] with multiplication (r,v)(s,w)  =  (rs,rw  +  vs  +  vw) where r, s∈R and v, w∈V.

Uniquely clean rings were introduced by Chen in [\cite=Chen]. A ring R is uniquely clean in case for any a∈R there exists a unique idempotent e∈R such that a  -  e∈R is invertible. In [\cite=GO], among others, uniquely δr-clean rings are studied. A ring R is called uniquely δr-clean if for every element a∈R there exists a unique idempotent e∈R such that a - e∈δ(R). Uniquely clean Dorroh extensions in [\cite=NZ] and uniquely δr-clean Dorroh extensions in [\cite=GO] are considered. Now we consider δ-quasipolar Dorroh extensions.

Let R be a ring. Then we have the following.

If D(R,V) is δ-quasipolar, then R is δ-quasipolar.

If the following conditions are satisfied, then D(R,V) is δ-quasipolar.

R is δ-quasipolar;

e2  =  e∈R, then ev  =  ve for all v∈V;

V  =  δ(V).

(1) Let r∈R. There exists e2  =  e∈D(R,V) such that e∈comm2(r,0) and (r,0)  +  e∈δ(D(R,V)). Since e∈D(R,V), e has the form such that (p,v)2  =  (p,v) and p2  =  p. Then e  =  (p,v)∈comm2(r,0) implies that p∈comm2(r) and r  +  p∈δ(R) since (r + p,v)∈δ(D(R,V)) and by [\cite=GO]. Hence R is δ-quasipolar.

(2) Assume that (i), (ii) and (iii) hold. Let (r,v)∈D(R,V). There exists p2  =  p∈comm2(r) such that r  +  p∈δ(R). By (iii), (0,V)  ⊆  δ(D(R,V)). Then (r,v)  +  (p,0)  =  (r  +  p,v)∈δ(D(R,V)).

As an application of Dorroh extensions we consider following example. This example also shows that in the Proposition [\ref=dor] (2), the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) are not superfluous.

Let R and S be any ring and M an (R,S)-bimodule. Consider the ring of the formal upper triangular matrix ring [formula]. It is well known that [formula]. However, if R  =  T  =  F is a field, then [formula].

The following example illustrate the δ-quasipolarity of full matrix rings and upper triangular matrix rings depend on the coefficient ring.

Weakly δ-quasipolar Rings

In this section, we introduce an upper class of δ-quasipolar rings, namely, weakly δ-quasipolar rings, and we give some properties of such rings.

An element of a ring is called strongly J-clean [\cite=Ch] provided that it can be written as the sum of an idempotent and an element in its Jacobson radical that commute. A ring is strongly J-clean in case each of its elements is strongly J-clean.

Let f:R  →  S be a surjective ring homomorphism. If R is weakly δ-quasipolar, then S is weakly δ-quasipolar.

Let s∈S with s  =  f(r) where r∈R. There exists an idempotent p∈comm(r) such that r  +  p∈δ(R). Let q = f(p). Then q2  =  q∈commf(r)  =  comm(s). By [\cite=Zh], f(δ(R))  ⊆  δ(S). Then s  +  q  =  f(r)  +  f(p)  =  f(r  +  p)∈f(δ(R))  ⊆  δ(S). Hence S is weakly δ-quasipolar.

Every direct summand of a weakly δ-quasipolar ring is weakly δ-quasipolar.

The converse statement of Proposition [\ref=don] need not hold in general. There are rings R, S and an epimorphism f:R  →  S with S is weakly δ-quasipolar but R is not.

Let [formula] be a finite direct product of rings. R is weakly δ-quasipolar if and only if each Ri is weakly δ-quasipolar for [formula].

One way is clear from Corollary [\ref=subring1]. We may assume that n  =  2 and R1 and R2 are weakly δ-quasipolar. Let a  =  (x1,x2)∈R. There exist idempotents pi∈comm(xi) such that xi  +  pi∈δ(Ri) for (i = 1,2). Then p  =  (p1,p2) is an idempotent in R and p∈comm(a) and a  +  p∈δ(R). Hence R is weakly δ-quasipolar.

In [\cite=GO], Gurgun and Ozcan introduce and investigate properties of δr-clean rings. Motivated by this work strongly δr-clean rings can be defined as follows.

Any strongly J-clean ring is strongly δr-clean. But the converse need not be true, for example any commutative semisimple ring which is not a Boolean ring is such a ring.

Note that in the following theorem it is proved that the notions of strongly δr-clean rings and weakly δ-quasipolar rings coincide.

Let R be a ring. Then R is a weakly δ-quasipolar ring if and only if it is strongly δr-clean.

Let R be a weakly δ-quasipolar ring and a∈R. There exits p2  =  p∈comm( - 1 + a) such that - 1 + a  +  p∈δ(R). Then a - (1 - p)∈δ(R) and a(1 - p)  =  (1 - p)a. Hence R is a strongly δr-clean ring. Conversely, assume that R is is a strongly δr-clean ring. Let a∈R. Since - a∈R, by assumption there exists an idempotent p∈R such that - a - p∈δ(R) and ( - a)p  =  p( - a). So R is is a weakly δ-quasipolar ring.

Theorem [\ref=burc] states that the weakly δ-quasipolarity of a ring is equivalent to the strongly δr-cleanness of this ring. But the following example shows that there are rings in which there exists a weakly δ-quasipolar element which is not strongly δr-clean and there exists a strongly δr-clean element which is not weakly δ-quasipolar.

Let R be a local ring with non-zero maximal ideal. Then the following are equivalent.

R is weakly δ-quasipolar;

R is strongly J-clean;

R is uniquely clean;

[formula];

[formula].

Let R be a local ring with non-zero maximal ideal. (1)  ⇔  (2) Assume that R is weakly δ-quasipolar. Let a∈R. There exists p2 = p∈comm( - 1 + a) such that - 1 + a + p∈δ(R). Then a - (1 - p)∈δ(R). Since p∈comm( - 1 + a), pa = ap. Hence R is strongly J-clean by J(R) = δ(R). Similarly, the rest is clear. (2)  ⇔  (3) follows from [\cite=Ch]. (3)  ⇔  (4) follows from [\cite=NZ]. (1)  ⇒  (5) Let R be weakly δ-quasipolar and [formula], we show that [formula]. Then there exist an idempotent p∈R such that - a + p∈δ(R) and p2 = p∈comm( - a). Since R is a local, p = 0 or p = 1. If p = 0, this contradicts [formula]. Therefore, p = 1. It follows that [formula]. (5)  ⇒  (1) It follows from Proposition [\ref=temel].
