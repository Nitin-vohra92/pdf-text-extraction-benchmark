Integrating in the Higgs Portal to Fermion Dark Matter

Introduction

Dark matter (DM) can couple to a gauge invariant operator [formula], where H is the standard model (SM) Higgs field. Since [formula] is the lowest-dimensional Lorentz- and gauge-invariant operator in the SM, such Higgs portal couplings to DM could dominate the interactions between the visible sector and the dark sector [\cite=Patt:2006fw] [\cite=MarchRussell:2008yu] [\cite=Andreas:2008xy] [\cite=Englert:2011yb] [\cite=Lebedev:2011iq] [\cite=LopezHonorez:2012kv] [\cite=Djouadi:2012zc] [\cite=Greljo:2013wja] [\cite=Fedderke:2014wda] [\cite=Craig:2014lda]. If DM is a scalar, φ, the Higgs portal operator, [formula], is renormalizable and the theory is in principle UV-complete. In contrast, if DM is a fermion, χ, the Higgs portal interactions are of mass dimension five,

[formula]

This necessarily implies the existence of new states at an energy scale Λ, the mediators between the Higgs field and the DM. Integrating out the mediators gives the above interactions in an Effective Field Theory (EFT). The presence of mediators offers new opportunities to experimentally search for the Higgs portal: Instead of searching directly for DM, one can search for the mediators instead.

The mediators in general fall into two categories: i) mediators that are electroweak singlets, or ii) mediators that are charged under the electroweak gauge group. In this paper we explore the phenomenology of both categories using three minimal renormalizable models of the Higgs portal (henceforth called UV completions). As a representative of the first category we choose a model where both the DM and the mediator are electroweak singlets (the singlet-singlet model). For the second category we consider two examples, a model where DM can be an electroweak singlet (the singlet-doublet model), and a model where DM is necessarily part of an electroweak multiplet (the doublet-triplet model).

For each model we compute the predicted relic density from thermal freeze-out and determine the parameter space that is consistent with the observed dark matter relic density. The viable parameter regions are confronted with bounds from direct detection, indirect detection and collider experiments. Interestingly, we find that the combination of these constraints often requires the mediators to have masses of similar magnitude as the DM fermion, χ. This means that the EFT Lagrangian in Eq. [\eqref=eq:eft] is in general not a good description for the computation of the relic density and the collider phenomenology. For these observables, we therefore treat all fields in the dark sector as dynamical degrees of freedom, i.e. we "integrate in" the Higgs portal.

Finally, we analyze how the UV Higgs portal completions can be probed by future direct detection and collider experiments. In particular, we consider the upcoming 14-TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with up to 3000 fb- 1 luminosity, a future e+e- collider with a center-of-mass energy of up to [formula], and a future pp collider with [formula].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:models] we introduce the three minimal UV completions of the fermion DM Higgs portal, in Sec. [\ref=sec:relic-density] we calculate the respective thermal relic densities, and in Sec. [\ref=sec:direct-detection] we estimate the DM direct detection rates. Sec. [\ref=sec:gamgam] deals with the constraints following from Higgs decays. In Sec. [\ref=sec:coll] we combine all the above constraints with the expected sensitivity of the LHC 14-TeV run and future colliders on the mediators. Appendix [\ref=app:one-loop-dd] contains the analytic formulae for loop-induced DM-Higgs interactions in a version of the doublet-triplet model that give the dominant direct detection signal.

The models

We start by introducing three minimal UV completions of the Higgs portal models with fermionic DM: (A) the singlet-singlet model, (B) the singlet-doublet model, and (C) the doublet-triplet model. All three examples are treated as rather than full theories, i.e. we do not consider issues such as anomaly cancellation and stability under renormalization group running to high scales.

The Singlet-Singlet Model

The dark sector is assumed to consist of DM, which is a [formula]-odd SM-singlet Majorana fermion, χ, and of a mediator, which is a [formula]-even real singlet scalar, φS. All SM fields are [formula] even. This model has already been discussed at length in the literature, see for example Refs. [\cite=Kim:2008pp] [\cite=Baek:2011aa] [\cite=Baek:2012uj] [\cite=Fairbairn:2013uta] [\cite=Esch:2013rta] [\cite=Baek:2014jga] [\cite=Bagherian:2014iia]. In this paper we update the limits on the model and show projections for the 14-TeV LHC and a future 100-TeV pp collider.

The relevant terms for interactions between the dark sector and the SM in the Lagrangian are

[formula]

where H is the SM Higgs field and V0(φS) contains cubic and quartic φS self-interactions. Here we use the four-component notation for the Majorana fermion χ. The scalar fields H and φS acquire the vacuum expectation values (vevs) v = 246 GeV and vS, respectively. The vev v breaks the electroweak symmetry, while vS does not. We can therefore write

[formula]

with G+,G0 the would-be Goldstone bosons eaten by the longitudinal components of the W+ and Z bosons, respectively. In terms of h and S the interaction Lagrangian is

[formula]

where mχ = mχ,0  +  y0vS is the DM mass, y = y0 and y5 = y5,0 are the parity-conserving and parity-violating Yukawa couplings, respectively, and m2S  =  m2S,0  +  λ'0v2  +  V''0(vS) is the singlet mass squared. The Higgs-singlet mixing parameter is given by μ'  =  μ'0  +  2λ'0vS, while μ2  =  μ20  +  μ'0vS  +  λ'0v2S, and λ(')  =  λ(')0. We also define V(S) = μSS3  +  λSS4 that contains triple and quartic singlet scalar interactions.

The DM state χ interacts with the SM through Higgs-singlet mixing. For [formula], the mass eigenstates h1,2 are admixtures of h and S,

[formula]

Here we use the abbreviations cα  =   cos α, sα  =   sin α. The mixing angle α and the masses of h1,2 are given by

[formula]

with the mass splitting (Δm2)2 = (m2S + 2μ2)2  +  4μ'2v2. The state h1 is the observed SM-like scalar with mass [formula] [\cite=Aad:2015zhl], whereas h2 is mostly singlet-like. The mixing angle α is constrained by the measured Higgs production and decay rates and, depending on the mass mh2, by the non-observation of a second Higgs scalar at the LHC, as we show in Sec. [\ref=sec:coll-ss]. In particular, Higgs-singlet mixing leads to the DM-SM interactions (here and below [formula] denotes Lagrangian in the mass eigenstate basis)

[formula]

where yf is the SM Yukawa coupling of the fermion f. The scalar interactions also govern direct detection signatures of spin-independent DM scattering off nuclei. Since the relevant effective coupling χχq is ~   sin (2α) (see Tab. [\ref=tab:dd-couplings]), direct detection experiments set strong constraints on the mixing angle α (see Figs. [\ref=fig:ssh] and [\ref=fig:singlet-singlet]).

The Singlet-Doublet Model

In this model the dark sector consists of two fermion fields, χD and χS, transforming under the SM electroweak group SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y as

[formula]

The field χD = (χ+D,χ0D) is a doublet of Dirac fermions with vector-like gauge interactions, while the singlet χS can be either a Dirac or a Majorana fermion. We discuss both of these possibilities. In the dark sector we impose a [formula] symmetry, χD,S  →    -  χD,S, under which the SM fermions are even. This forbids mixing with neutrinos and makes the lighter of the two mass eigenstates in the dark sector stable.

Dirac singlet fermion.

We first discuss the case where χS is a Dirac fermion. The particle content of this model consists of two neutral Dirac fermions, χS and χ0D, and a charged Dirac fermion χ+D. The relevant terms in the Lagrangian are

[formula]

Without loss of generality, the Yukawa coupling y can be chosen real by redefining the complex phase of the χD. After electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) this term introduces the mixing between χS and χ0D. For later convenience, we define the mixing angle θa generally as

[formula]

Here a = 2, and the heavy and light mass eigenstates, χ0h and χ0l, are given by

[formula]

with the corresponding mass eigenvalues

[formula]

The charged state χ+D has a mass m+ = mD. In the mass eigenstate basis, the interactions of the neutral fermions with the Z and Higgs bosons read

[formula]

It is interesting to consider two parameter limits of this model. For |mD - mS|  ≪  |yv|, χS and χ0D are maximally mixed, θ2  ≈  π / 4. The two neutral mass eigenstates are split by [formula], while the charged state has a mass m+  =  mD  ≈  (m0h + m0l) / 2, and thus lies in between the two neutral states. Because of the large mixing, the DM coupling to the Z boson is unsuppressed, so that direct DM detection searches exclude this possibility.

If |mD  -  mS|  ≫  yv, χ0h is significantly heavier than χ0l. For mD > mS, the DM state is mostly a singlet, χ0l≃  -  χS  +  θ'χ0D with [formula]. The coupling of DM to the Z boson is thus suppressed, and the model is allowed by direct DM searches. In contrast, if mS > mD, DM is mostly a doublet, χ0l  ~  χ0D, with unsuppressed couplings to the Z boson. This possibility is therefore excluded by direct DM searches.

Majorana singlet fermion.

The second possibility is that χS is a Majorana fermion. This scenario corresponds to the bino-higgsino system (with decoupled wino) in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for tan β = 1 and [formula]. Some phenomenology of the singlet-doublet Majorana model has also been explored in Refs. [\cite=Carena:2004ha] [\cite=Mahbubani:2005pt] [\cite=D'Eramo:2007ga] [\cite=Enberg:2007rp] [\cite=Cohen:2011ec]. We will slightly abuse the notation, such that in this subsection χS denotes a two-component Weyl fermion, while χD and χcD are two left-handed Weyl fermions forming a Dirac fermion. They transform under SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y as χD  ~  (2,1 / 2) and χcD  ~  (2, - 1 / 2). The translation to four-component notation is given by [formula], where the final χD is the Dirac fermion in Eq. [\eqref=eq:chiD] (here εij is the antisymmetric tensor in the SU(2)L space). In two-component notation, the relevant terms in the Lagrangian read

[formula]

where the contractions of Lorentz and SU(2)L indices are implicit (for Lorentz contractions we use the convention of Ref. [\cite=Dreiner:2008tw]). Here and henceforth we assume that χD and χcD couple with equal but opposite strength to the Higgs boson, and choose y to be real. This prevents contributions to the electromagnetic dipole moment of the electron [\cite=Mahbubani:2005pt]. Furthermore, the interactions in Eq. [\eqref=eq:Majorana:singlet] feature a global SU(2)R symmetry (broken by the hypercharge), which protects the electroweak T parameter from large corrections. After EWSB, the mass term for the neutral states is given by [formula]. In the basis χi  =  {χS,χc0D,χ0D}, the mass matrix reads

[formula]

which is diagonalized by the following transformation

[formula]

The mixing angle θ4 is given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:mixing-angle]) with a = 4. The masses of the three neutral eigenstates, χ0h,l and χ0m, are

[formula]

respectively, while the mass of the charged state χ+D is m+ = mD as in the Dirac χS case. The couplings of the neutral fermions to Z and h are given by

[formula]

Let us consider the parameter limits in this model. For mD  ≈  mS (i.e. |mD - mS|  ≪  2yv, but [formula]), the mixing angle is θ4≃π / 4. We have three Majorana states split by |yv|, that is m0h,l≃mD  ±  |yv| and m0m = mD. The lightest state, χ0l, is the DM candidate. All Z couplings to the DM field are thus off-diagonal. The DM direct detection signal due to tree-level Z exchange is therefore kinematically forbidden, as long as the mass splitting Δm4 is larger than several hundred keV. This requirement is fulfilled for all the benchmarks that we consider. At the same time, in the above limit of θ4≃π / 4 the coupling of the Higgs boson to the DM field χ0l is maximal and dominates spin-independent DM interactions with nuclei.

In the limit |mD - mS|  ≫  yv with mD  ≫  mS, we have θ4≃π / 2. The states χ0h and χ0m are quasi-degenerate with masses m0h = mD + (yv)2 / mD and m0m = mD, respectively, and form a pseudo-Dirac state. Its couplings to the Z boson are that of the neutral component in a Dirac fermion electroweak doublet, if the mass splitting can be ignored. The lightest state χ0l is mostly a singlet with mass m0l = mS  -  (yv)2 / mD. In the decoupling scenario mD  ≫  mS,yv, both the Z and Higgs exchange in direct DM searches are thus absent at the tree level. This feature protects the decoupling scenario from being excluded by direct DM searches. If instead the singlet decouples, i.e. if mS  ≫  mD, then the mixing angle is θ4≃0. Now χ0l and χ0m are quasi-degenerate states with mass m0l  ≈  m0m = mD. They form a pseudo-Dirac fermion with unsuppressed couplings to the Z boson. This limit is therefore excluded by direct DM searches.

For [formula], the lightest neutral state can be a pure doublet, χ0m. In this scenario, DM interactions with nuclei are absent at tree level. Up to radiative corrections the DM state χ0m is mass-degenerate with the charged state χ+D, which leads to strong co-annihilation (see Sec. [\ref=sec:relic-density]).

The Doublet-Triplet Model

In this model we assume that the dark sector consists of two fermions, an electroweak doublet, χD, and a triplet, χT, that transform under SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y as

[formula]

We consider the cases r = 0, - 1, in which both χD and χT have neutral components. For r = 0, χT can be either a Dirac fermion or a Majorana fermion, while χD is always a Dirac fermion. We thus consider three cases: r =  - 1 with Dirac triplet, r = 0 with Dirac triplet, and r = 0 with Majorana triplet.

Dirac triplet fermion, r =  - 1.

In this case the electroweak triplet is composed of a neutral state, χ0T, a singly charged state, χ-T, and a doubly charged state, χ-  -T, while the electroweak doublet contains a neutral state, χ0D, and a charged state, χ-D, thus

[formula]

The mass terms and Yukawa interactions are

[formula]

After EWSB, the corresponding mass matrices in the bases {χ0T,χ0D} and {χ-T,χ-D} are

[formula]

respectively, while the mass of χ-  -T is mT. EWSB thus introduces mixing between both neutral and charged states, so that the mass eigenstates are given by

[formula]

with the corresponding mass eigenvalues

[formula]

The mixing angles θ2,1 and the mass splittings Δm2,1 are defined in ([\ref=eq:mixing-angle]), with mS  →  mT. Since the splitting in the neutral sector is larger than in the charged sector, Δm2  >  Δm1, the lightest neutral state χ0l is a potential DM candidate if mD and mT have the same sign. As in Sec. [\ref=sec:sd], we use the freedom in the phase of χD to make y real and positive. In the basis of mass eigenstates, the interactions of the neutral states with the Z and Higgs bosons are given by

[formula]

We consider two parameter limits, i) almost degenerate doublet and triplet, and ii) the decoupling limit. The degenerate case occurs for mD  ≈  mT, so that |mD - mT|  ≪  |yv|. In this case the mixing is maximal in both the neutral and charged sectors, θ2,1≃π / 4. The mass eigenvalues are [formula] for the neutral states, and m-h,l≃mT  ±  |yv|  /  2 for the charged states.

In the decoupling limit mD,mT  ≫  yv, DM is either predominantly the neutral component of the doublet (for mD < mT) or of the triplet (for mT < mD), with a mixing angle of O(y2v2 / (mT - mD)2). The masses for the neutral states in the two cases are m0h≃mD(T)  +  y2v2  /  (2|mD  -  mT|) and m0l≃mT(D)  -  y2v2  /  (2|mD  -  mT|), while for the charged states the mass deviation from mD,T is half as large. Since in this model the coupling of DM to the Z boson is not suppressed, the direct DM detection searches exclude the entire region of parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic density.

Dirac triplet fermion, r = 0.

The electroweak doublet is composed of a neutral state, χ0D, and a charged state, χ+D, while the electroweak triplet is composed of one neutral state, χ0T, and two charged states, χ+T,χT'-,

[formula]

The mass terms and Yukawa couplings are given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:mass:triplet]. After EWSB, the mass matrices for neutral and charged states are similar to Eq. [\eqref=eq:mass:matrix:triplet], but with M0  →  M+ and M-  →  M0, in the bases {χ+T,χ+D} and {χ0T,χ0D}, respectively, while χT'- has a mass of mT. The heavy and light states in the neutral and charged sectors have masses

[formula]

The lightest neutral state can thus be lighter than the lightest charged state, if mD and mT have opposite signs. However, as for the case r =  - 1, this model is excluded by constraints from the DM relic density and direct detection searches. In particular, obtaining the correct thermal relic density requires sizeable doublet-triplet mixing (see Sec. [\ref=sec:relic-density]), which leads to large direct detection rates from coupling of the doublet component to the Z boson.

Majorana triplet fermion, r = 0.

Taking instead the electroweak triplet to be a Majorana fermion, i.e. χ±T  =  χT'± in ([\ref=eq:dt0]), while the doublet is still a Dirac fermion, the mass terms and Yukawa interactions in the two-component notation are (see also Eq. [\eqref=eq:Majorana:singlet])

[formula]

where, as in the Majorana singlet-doublet model, we have introduced two left-handed Weyl fermions transforming under SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y as χD  ~  (2,1 / 2) and χcD  ~  (2, - 1 / 2). As for the Majorana singlet-doublet model, the form of the Yukawa coupling terms is restricted by a global SU(2)R symmetry to protect the electroweak T parameter. We use the freedom of field redefinitions to make mD and y real and positive. The mass mT is in general a free complex parameter, but restricted to real values in our analysis. After EWSB, the Yukawa interactions mix the triplet and the doublet components. The three neutral Weyl fermions χ0i  =  {χ0T,χc0D,χ0D} have a Majorana mass term [formula]. The charged fermions have Dirac masses [formula], where the negatively charged Weyl fermions are χ-m  =  {χ-T,χc -D}, and the positively charged ones, χ+n  =  {χ+T,χ+D}. The two mass matrices are

[formula]

The mass matrix for neutral states is diagonalized by, cf. Eq. [\eqref=eq:smd-eigensystem],

[formula]

whereas the charged mass eigenstates are

[formula]

The mass spectrum is given by

[formula]

In the basis of mass eigenstates, the couplings of neutral fermions to the Z and Higgs bosons are given by

[formula]

This scenario corresponds to the wino-higgsino system (with decoupled bino) in the MSSM for tan β = 1 and y = g. The DM phenomenology of the doublet-triplet Majorana model for the case where [formula] and [formula] has been studied in Ref. [\cite=Dedes:2014hga]. In this parameter region, one typically has the mass ordering mb  <  |ma,c|, so that the DM candidate χ0l  =  χ0b is a pure doublet fermion. In this case χ0l has no diagonal tree-level couplings to the Z and Higgs bosons. The direct detection cross-section in this scenario is loop-induced and thus suppressed (see Sec. [\ref=sec:direct-detection]).

On the other hand, if [formula], the mass ordering is mc  <  mb  <  ma and the lightest neutral and charged states are mass-degenerate at tree-level. This degeneracy is lifted by one-loop corrections involving gauge bosons, leading to [\cite=Giudice:1995np] [\cite=Cheng:1998hc] [\cite=Feng:1999fu] [\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw]

[formula]

In the limit mT,mD,|mT - mD|  ≫  mZ the radiative splittings are given by

[formula]

The corrections to the off-diagonal elements in the mass matrix have been neglected above, which is justified for yv  ≪  |mT - mD|. The one-loop corrections can also be neglected for the calculation of the mixing angles. Since the corrections δm+T and δm+D are positive, the lightest state of the spectrum is the neutral state χ0c, a DM candidate. As is apparent in Eq. [\eqref=eq:maj-dt-int], the Z boson coupling to a DM pair χ0cχ0c is absent and the Higgs coupling is proportional to sin (2θ2). Direct detection signals are thus suppressed for a small mixing angle θ2.

Thermal relic density

As described above, we assume that the fermionic Higgs portal is responsible for explaining the entire dark matter density through thermal freeze-out in the early universe.

In the singlet-singlet model, DM preferentially annihilates into h2h2 and h2h1 final states, if kinematically allowed. The amplitude for χχ  →  h2h2 is proportional to cos 2α, where α is the h-S mixing angle, so that annihilation can be efficient even for very small values of α. For mχ  <  (mh1 + mh2) / 2, the main annihilation channels are into h1h1 and W+W-, where the latter proceeds via off-shell h1,2 exchange in the s-channel. For small values of mχ, the b final state can also become relevant. The rates for these processes grow with sin α. The requirement of a sufficiently large annihilation cross-section then imposes a lower bound on sin α.

For the Majorana DM models with fermion mediators (the Majorana singlet-doublet model in Sec. [\ref=sec:sd] and the Majorana doublet-triplet model in Sec. [\ref=sec:doublet:triplet]), the main channels for pair annihilation of the neutral DM candidates involve WW and ZZ final states. These processes are mediated by one of the mediator fermion states in the t-channel, see Fig. [\ref=fig:diag1], since the Zχ0lχ0l coupling vanishes exactly. For the Majorana singlet-doublet model, annihilation via the s-channel Higgs-boson resonance is also a viable option for m0l  ≈  mh / 2. In this case, resonant enhancement from the Higgs-boson propagator leads to a sufficiently large annihilation cross-section to produce the correct relic density. The dominant annihilation final states are then given by the leading Higgs decay modes, i.  e. b, WW*, gg and τ+τ-.

In contrast, in the Dirac singlet-doublet model, the DM annihilation mainly proceeds through s-channel Z-boson exchange. Only for very large DM masses, m0l  ~  O(1 TeV), annihilation into WW and ZZ final states through t-channel fermion exchange becomes important.

In the singlet-doublet models (both for the Majorana and Dirac cases), the lightest neutral fermion is constrained to be mostly singlet, to avoid the strong direct detection bounds for doublet dark matter (see Sec. [\ref=sec:direct-detection]). However, the singlet nature of DM in these models also suppresses the annihilation cross-section, thus typically yielding too large of a relic density. Nevertheless, the correct DM density could still be obtained if χ0lχ± and χ0lχ0m co-annihilation processes contribute at a sizeable level. As a result, the allowed parameter space is limited to relatively small values for the mass splitting mD - mS. One exception is the Higgs resonance region for the Majorana singlet-doublet model, where the correct value for the annihilation cross-section can be obtained without co-annihilation.

In the scenario with pure doublet Majorana DM, χ0m, the degeneracy of the states χ0m and χ+D leads to strong co-annihilation. The correct thermal relic density is obtained only if all dark particles lie above the TeV scale. Since such a scenario is not accessible at the LHC or planned future colliders, e.g., a proton-proton collider with [formula] or an e+e- collider with [formula], we do not investigate this possibility further.

We have computed the relic density using MicrOMEGAs 3.6.9.2 [\cite=Belanger:2013oya], which automatically incorporates co-annihilation processes and three-body final states through off-shell W / Z production. The models described in the previous section have been implemented into model files for CalcHEP [\cite=Belyaev:2012qa], which is used for the matrix-element generation within MicrOMEGAs. The relic density is then required to match the value obtained by the Planck collaboration [\cite=Planck:2015xua],

[formula]

For the models with fermion mediators, this reduces the three-dimensional parameter space, e.g. mD,  mS / T,  y, for each model down to two independent parameters. This is illustrated by the solid colored lines in Figs. [\ref=fig:majsd]-[\ref=fig:majdt].

It is worth pointing out that the Majorana doublet-triplet model has two distinct regions of parameter space that are compatible with the relic density constraint from Eq. [\eqref=eq:cdm]. The first region is realized for [formula] and [formula], leading to a DM candidate χ0l  =  χ0b that is an unmixed doublet state with mass of a few 100 GeV [\cite=Dedes:2014hga].

The second possibility is obtained for [formula]. In this case, the lightest neutral and charged states, χ0l  =  χ0c and χ±l  =  χ±c, are split only by small radiative corrections (see the end of Sec. [\ref=sec:doublet:triplet]). As a result, there is strong co-annihilation and the relic density comes out too small if the DM mass is below about 1 TeV.

Fig. [\ref=fig:majdtx] shows the parameter space that is compatible with the relic density constraint in both cases, as a function of the mass parameters mD,T and for several sample values of y. To ensure perturbativity, an upper limit y  <  3 has been imposed. Unfortunately, the second scenario, where all the new fermion states are beyond 1 TeV, is inaccessible at the LHC and planned future accelerators. Therefore we will not study it any further in Sec. [\ref=sec:coll].

Direct detection

The non-observation of DM scattering off atomic nuclei, referred to as direct detection, leads to strong bounds on our models of fermion DM. At the tree level, spin-independent interactions of the lightest neutral state of the spectrum, χ0l, with quarks q inside the nucleus are generally mediated by the Higgs boson and, in case χ0l is a Dirac fermion, also by the Z boson. Since the momentum transfer in DM-nucleus scattering is much smaller than the Higgs or Z mass, spin-independent DM-quark interactions can be described by an effective Lagrangian,

[formula]

The Z- and Higgs-mediated effective couplings GqZ and Gqh are listed for our models in Tab. [\ref=tab:dd-couplings]. We show only models with a suppressed Z coupling, which can pass the limits from direct detection searches and simultaneously provide the correct DM relic density. By comparing the dependence on the fermion mixing angle θa with the definition in ([\ref=eq:mixing-angle]), it is apparent that all models favor a small Yukawa coupling y to evade bounds from direct detection. At zero momentum transfer, the cross-section for spin-independent scattering of a DM particle off a nucleus with mass number A and proton number Z is given by

[formula]

where fp and fn are the DM couplings to protons and neutrons, σp = kμ2pf2p  /  π is the DM-proton cross-section, μ2i  =  m2χm2i / (mχ + mi)2 is the reduced mass, and k = 1(4) if DM is a Dirac (Majorana) fermion. In terms of the effective interactions in Eq. ([\ref=eq:dd-eff]), the DM-proton coupling is given by

[formula]

and analogously for fn with p  →  n. Here δD = 1  (0) for a Dirac (Majorana) DM fermion, q = u,d,s and Q = c,b,t denote light and heavy quarks, and [formula], where mpf(p)Tq  =  〈p|mq  q|p〉 describes the matrix element of quarks inside the proton.

The results of direct detection searches are usually expressed in terms of the DM-nucleon cross-section σN = kμ2Nf2N  /  π, taking the isotope abundances in the detector material into account and assuming isospin-conserving couplings fN = fp = fn and μ2N  =  μ2p  ≈  μ2n. However, if DM is a Dirac fermion, the interaction through Z exchange can induce significant isospin violation, resulting in fp  ≠  fn. When deriving bounds on the DM-proton cross-section σp in our Dirac DM models, we therefore rescale the experimental bounds on σN from Ref. [\cite=Feng:2011vu]

[formula]

where ηi denotes the abundance of isotope Ai. The ratio fn / fp for our models is listed in the last column on Tab. [\ref=tab:dd-couplings]. The Z-exchange contribution in the Dirac singlet-doublet model is so large that it dominates the DM-quark interaction. The resulting isospin breaking leads to a cancellation in the DM-nucleus scattering amplitude. The bounds from direct detection on this model are therefore much weaker than they would be when neglecting isospin effects. Since isospin violation in Higgs exchange is very small, the cross-sections in all other models are not subject to isospin breaking effects.

In our numerical analysis, we compare the DM-nucleon cross-sections computed with MicrOMEGAs 3.6.9.2 [\cite=Belanger:2013oya] with the latest bounds from the LUX experiment [\cite=Akerib:2013tjd] and projected bounds for the XENON1T experiment [\cite=Aprile:2012zx]. We use the values for the scalar nucleon quark form factors f(p,n)Tq given in Tab. 3 of Ref. [\cite=Belanger:2013oya]. For the Dirac singlet-doublet model we take into account isospin violation using ([\ref=eq:iso-viol]), with the isotope abundances for Xenon listed in Tab. II of Ref. [\cite=Feng:2011vu]. The resulting bounds on the parameter space in each model are displayed in the figures in Sec. [\ref=sec:coll].

In models with Majorana DM, Z-mediated spin-independent scattering off nuclei is generally absent at tree level, since the Majorana fermion is its own anti-particle, while the vector current is odd under charge conjugation. In the Majorana doublet-triplet model with pure doublet DM, χ0l  =  χ0b, also the Higgs-mediated scattering vanishes at tree level. The reason is that χ0b does not obtain its mass from the Higgs mechanism and does not mix with the triplet through Yukawa interactions. A DM-Higgs interaction is induced at one-loop through the exchange of dark fermions and electroweak gauge bosons,

[formula]

The Yukawa correction δy is a function of the parameters y, m0a = m+a, and m0c = m+c. An analytic expression is given in Appendix [\ref=app:one-loop-dd]. This vertex generates an effective DM-nucleon scalar interaction Gqh through Higgs exchange, as given in Tab. [\ref=tab:dd-couplings]. Scalar interactions are also induced by box diagrams with W and Z bosons. These contributions are numerically sub-leading if the Yukawa coupling y is large, which is the case if DM is a doublet. We therefore neglect them in our analysis.

Higgs decays

In the singlet-singlet model, mixing between the doublet Higgs h and the singlet scalar S leads to a universal suppression of all couplings of the SM-like scalar h1,

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus the value of the mixing angle α can be constrained from measurements of the Higgs production rates at the LHC and future colliders [\cite=Lopez-Val:2013yba] [\cite=Englert:2014uua].

In the doublet-triplet model, the decay rate of the Higgs boson into two photons, Γ(h  →  γγ), is changed at the one-loop level due to the presence of virtual charged fermions. The decay ratio with respect to the SM rate, ΓSM(h  →  γγ), is given by

[formula]

Here the one-loop amplitudes for the SM, ASM, and the charged fermions, Aχ, are defined as

[formula]

where τi = m2h / (4m2i) and the loop functions for τ  ≤  1 are,

[formula]

In terms of the mass eigenstates from Eq. ([\ref=eq:dmt-mass]), the amplitude is given by

[formula]

Notice that Aχ is proportional to y2 and thus independent of the sign of the Yukawa coupling. Furthermore, the contribution vanishes in the limit of no fermion mixing, so that at least two charged fermions are required to induce the Higgs decay. Since AF(τ) is monotonously increasing with τ and since m+a  >  m+c per definition, Aχ is always negative for positive m+a,c. The contribution of charged fermions thus depletes the h  →  γγ decay rate below the SM expectation. As we will discuss in Sec. [\ref=sec:coll], the measurements of Rγ by the LHC collaborations set strong constraints on the Majorana triplet-doublet model in the parameter space where the Yukawa coupling is sizeable.

Results and collider bounds

In what follows, numerical results for the allowed parameters for each of the Higgs portal models introduced in Sec. [\ref=sec:models] will be shown. Besides constraints from the relic density and direct DM detection, we also evaluate bounds from current LHC data at [formula] (LHC8), as well as projections for upcoming LHC runs at [formula] (LHC14) and future planned colliders. In particular we consider the reach of a proton-proton collider with [formula] (called FCC-hh in the following) and of a high-energy e+e- collider with [formula], such as the planned International Linear Collider (ILC).

In the singlet-singlet model, the experimental sensitivity to the new states is due to the Higgs-singlet mixing. This modifies the couplings of the SM-like Higgs, h1, to the SM fermions and gauge bosons, which can be determined by measurements of the Higgs production rate in different decay channels. One can also search directly for the second scalar state, h2, in the same channels as for the SM Higgs, but with a different mass and different production cross-section. The most sensitive channels are h2  →  WW and h2  →  ZZ.

In the singlet-doublet and doublet-triplet models, the particle spectrum involving several neutral and charged fermions can lead to LHC signatures with leptons and missing energy. The most important channel is given by

[formula]

and its charge-conjugated versions. The production process, mediated by an off-shell W boson, is present both in the Majorana and Dirac DM models, and its rate is governed by the SU(2) gauge quantum numbers of the fermion multiplets. The only decay channel for the lightest charged fermion is also through an off-shell W boson. For the next-to-lightest neutral fermion, tree-level decays can be mediated by an off-shell Z or Higgs boson, but the latter is suppressed to a negligible level by the small Higgs-boson width.

The process [\eqref=eq:lhcsign] leads to a final state of three leptons ([formula]) and missing energy, with a phenomenology similar to the neutralino-chargino sector of the MSSM with heavy scalars. This signature has been searched for by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [\cite=Aad:2014nua] [\cite=Khachatryan:2014qwa]. If the mass difference between the DM fermion and the heavier fermions is small, which is the case in the regions of parameter space where co-annihilation is important, the leptons can become too soft to pass the usual multi-lepton selection cuts. In this case, mono-jet searches provide the strongest limits from the published 8-TeV LHC data [\cite=Khachatryan:2014rra] [\cite=Aad:2015zva].

Notice that the heavier neutral fermions χ0m,h can in general also decay through a loop-induced radiative decay, χ0m,h  →  χ0l  +  γ. However, the branching fraction is suppressed to the percent level if either the heavy state, χ0m,h, or the light state, χ0l, has a dominant doublet component [\cite=Bramante:2014tba], as is the case for the models considered here.

Singlet-Singlet Model

At colliders, this model can be most effectively tested by searching for the effects of the singlet scalar mediator, S. It mixes with the Higgs, h, so that the mass eigenstates h1 and h2 are admixtures of S and h, see Eq. [\eqref=eq:mixingSh]. As a result, the production and decays of the SM-like scalar h1 to SM fermions and gauge bosons are suppressed by a common factor cos 2α, as discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:gamgam].

When interpreting the CMS and ATLAS Higgs measurements, we need to distinguish two cases. If mχ < mh1 / 2, then h1  →  χ is allowed, and thus the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs, [formula], could be sizeable. Allowing for an invisible decay of the Higgs and demanding [formula], ATLAS obtains in a global analysis κV > 0.93 at 95% C.L., κf = 1.05  ±  0.16 and Br(h1  →  inv) < 0.13 [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2015-007]. (CMS obtains a much looser bound Br(h1  →  inv) < 0.49 for [formula] [\cite=Khachatryan:2014jba].) The invisible decay width is given by

[formula]

and thus depends on sα, as well as on y and y5. The correct relic abundance can be obtained for y as small as O(10- 2) [\cite=Esch:2013rta]. This means that, allowing for all values of y, y5 that satisfy the Planck measurement [\eqref=eq:cdm], the strongest constraint on cα is not the bound on Br(h1  →  inv), but rather the bound on κV. We therefore have at 95% C.L.

[formula]

or sα < 0.37.

If mχ > mh1 / 2, the invisible decay width of the Higgs is zero. We can therefore use the results of global fits of the Higgs data, where only κf  =  κb  =  κτ  =  κt and κV  =  κW  =  κZ are varied. Combining the CMS results, [formula] and κf = 0.87+ 0.14- 0.13 [\cite=Khachatryan:2014jba], and ATLAS results, [formula], κf = 1.11+ 0.17- 0.15 [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2015-007], gives [formula] or a 95% C.L. lower bound

[formula]

corresponding to sα < 0.318. The bound [\eqref=eq:bound:calpha] also applies for mχ just slightly below mh1 / 2, where the invisible decay width of the Higgs is negligible because of phase space suppression. The above results assume that h2 is not (approximately) mass degenerate with h1. In the remainder of this subsection we will assume that this is true and that, furthermore, h2 is appreciably heavier than h1. For bounds away from this limit in a subset of our parameter space, see for instance Ref. [\cite=Falkowski:2015iwa].

The bounds on α can be improved by Higgs coupling measurements at future colliders [\cite=Englert:2014uua]. The LHC with [formula] and 3000 fb- 1 luminosity (HL-LHC) can establish a limit of [formula] at 95% C.L., assuming that the central values of all observables agree with the SM prediction. The projected reach of ILC with [formula] and 500 fb- 1 is [formula].

In Fig. [\ref=fig:ssh], these bounds are compared to the region of parameter space of the singlet-singlet model that is consistent with the relic density constraint in Eq. [\eqref=eq:cdm]. The points in the figure are obtained through a parameter scan, where the model parameters are varied randomly within the following ranges:

[formula]

The values of μ' and mS are determined from the mixing angle sα and the masses mh1,2, see Eq. [\eqref=eq:mixingSh2], while λS is irrelevant for the relic density calculation. For simplicity and to avoid constraints from CP violation, we take y5 = 0. For each random point, the value of y is fixed by the relic density constraint, Eq. [\eqref=eq:cdm], and the condition y  <  3 is imposed to ensure perturbativity. Points shown as yellow circles are excluded by limits on the spin-independent direct detection cross-section from LUX [\cite=Akerib:2013tjd], while the red crosses and blue dots are within and beyond the projected reach of XENON1T [\cite=Aprile:2012zx], respectively.

One can also search directly for the heavy Higgs, h2. The decay widths to SM fermions and gauge bosons are given by

[formula]

where V = W,Z,γ,g, and Γ(H  →  XX)SM is the partial width of the would-be SM Higgs if it had a mass mh2. If only the SM decay channels are open, the branching ratios of h2 are thus given by the branching ratios of the SM Higgs with mass mh2. Similarly, the production cross-section is σ(h2) = s2ασ(H)SM, and is given by the would-be SM Higgs production with mass mh2.

For mh2 > 2mh1, the decay h2  →  h1h1 is kinematically allowed. It proceeds through the interactions

[formula]

If the mixing angle is small, sα  ≪  1, then the h2h1h1 coupling is equal to μ' / 2. This means that the h2  →  h1h1 branching ratio can be large and will dominate over h2  →  WW,ZZ,t for μ'  ≫  v. On the other hand, if μ'  ≪  v, the decay h2  →  h1h1 will be subleading. It is also possible to make the h2  →  h1h1 branching ratio small while keeping sα large, by canceling different contributions in Eq. [\eqref=eq:h2h1h1]. For mh2 > 2mχ, the decay h2  →  inv. is open and can become dominant for sizeable values of y or y5. The actual constraint from h2 decays thus strongly depends on the specific realization of the model.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:singlet-singlet] (left), we show the bounds from searches for direct decays of h2 into SM final states. They can be expressed as a constraint on [formula] as a function of mh2, where V = W,Z,γ,g. The most constraining channels are h2  →  WW,ZZ, with the resulting bound from CMS shown as a dashed black curve [\cite=Khachatryan:2015cwa]. The searches in the di-photon channel, h2  →  γγ, are effective at lower h2 masses. The resulting bounds from ATLAS [\cite=Aad:2014ioa] and CMS [\cite=Khachatryan:2014ira] are shown as solid curves in the upper left corner. In Fig. [\ref=fig:singlet-singlet] (right), we also show bounds on [formula] from di-Higgs searches. The CMS [\cite=CMS-PAS-HIG-13-032] and ATLAS [\cite=Aad:2014yja] bounds from h2  →  h1h1  →  2γ2b are shown as solid black and blue lines, respectively. The CMS bound from h2  →  h1h1  →  4b [\cite=CMS-PAS-HIG-14-013] is shown as a dashed black line. There are also CMS di-Higgs searches with di-photon and leptonic final states [\cite=Khachatryan:2014jya] and h2  →  ττ [\cite=Khachatryan:2014wca]. However, with their current precision these results do not constrain sα. We see that relatively large mixing angles sα  ~  0.3 are allowed for all h2 masses, comparable to the constraints from global Higgs coupling measurements in Eq. [\eqref=eq:calpha:bound]. In Fig. [\ref=fig:singlet-singlet] we also show as dashed (solid) red lines the projected exclusions at 14 TeV LHC with 300 fb- 1 (3000 fb- 1) obtained in Ref. [\cite=Buttazzo:2015bka]. At the end of the high luminosity LHC run, mixing angles as small as [formula] can be probed for mh2  ~  400 GeV. Notice that for large h2 masses, large mixings are additionally constrained by electroweak precision tests [\cite=Martin-Lozano:2015dja] [\cite=Falkowski:2015iwa].

At a 100 TeV collider, one can also search directly for DM production through an off-shell singlet mediator in the monojet signal, pp  →  h*1(  →  χ)j, even if h1 does not decay to DM [\cite=Craig:2014lda]. This signature is quite challenging due to its very small cross-section, and can thus be observed only in a small parameter region with mχ just above mh1 / 2. More promising is the signal with two jets and missing energy, where the presence of an additional jet allows for easier discrimination from the background [\cite=Khoze:2015sra].

As can be seen from the figures, current and future direct detection experiments can cover a significantly larger portion of the parameter space of the singlet-singlet model than collider experiments. However, there are also many parameter points that are not constrained by available data from LUX, but that are excluded by LHC results for Higgs couplings and heavy Higgs searches. Therefore, collider and direct detection experiments provide complementary information for probing this model. On the other hand, the correct relic density can be realized for very small values of the mixing angle, [formula], which cannot be tested conclusively either at colliders or through direct detection.

Majorana Singlet-Doublet Model

For [formula], co-annihilation is required in the Majorana singlet-doublet model to obtain the correct thermal relic density for weak Yukawa couplings, y  <  1. This implies that the mass difference m0m  -  m0l is preferred to be a few tens of GeV. For DM masses in the TeV range the model thus becomes significantly fine-tuned. We therefore restrict ourselves to the range [formula].

If the mass difference becomes too small, the relic density constraint cannot be satisfied even for very small values of y. This is depicted by the shaded region at the bottom of Fig. [\ref=fig:majsd]. On the other hand, large values of y are constrained by limits on the spin-independent direct detection cross-section from LUX [\cite=Akerib:2013tjd] (see shaded region at the top of the plot).

In the remaining allowed part of parameter space, the mass difference m0m  -  m0l is relatively small, so that the leptons from the process [\eqref=eq:lhcsign] are soft and fail the selection cuts for the [formula] signature [\cite=Aad:2014nua] [\cite=Khachatryan:2014qwa]. On the other hand, the production cross-section for [\eqref=eq:lhcsign] is too small to be constrained by the available mono-jet data [\cite=Khachatryan:2014rra] [\cite=Aad:2015zva]. As a consequence, no bound on the cosmologically preferred parameter space of the singlet-doublet model is obtained from LHC8 data (see also Refs. [\cite=Schwaller:2013baa] [\cite=Martin:2014qra] [\cite=Han:2014sya]). Similarly, the projected reach for the [formula] signal of the LHC14 [\cite=CMS:2013xfa] [\cite=ATLAS:2013hta] and FCC-hh [\cite=Gori:2014oua] [\cite=Acharya:2014pua] does not extend into the white region in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsd].

Instead, requiring a hard initial-state jet can help to trigger on events with soft leptons and improve the signal-to-background ratio for this case. Several authors have analyzed this signature, consisting of at least one hard jet, large missing energy, and at least two soft leptons, and found it to be promising for the parameter region preferred by co-annihilation [\cite=Gori:2013ala] [\cite=Schwaller:2013baa] [\cite=Low:2014cba] [\cite=Han:2014kaa] [\cite=Bramante:2014tba]. We have obtained the estimated 95% C.L. reach of LHC14 by recasting the analysis of Ref. [\cite=Schwaller:2013baa]. Concretely, Ref. [\cite=Schwaller:2013baa] contains results for a Majorana singlet-triplet scenario, with the dominant signal contribution stemming from the process [\eqref=eq:lhcsign]. In our case, since we have heavy doublet fermions instead of a triplet, the production cross-section is reduced by a factor of two. After accounting for this change in the production rate, the projected limits shown by the short-dashed (for 300 fb- 1) and dotted (for 3000 fb- 1) lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsd] are obtained. As can be seen from the figure, such an analysis will only be able to test this model for relatively small DM masses, [formula], and only in the high-luminosity run of the LHC.

However, a much larger part of the parameter space can be probed with FCC-hh with [formula]. We use the results for higgsino and higgsino-bino scenarios in Ref. [\cite=Low:2014cba], which directly correspond to our Majorana singlet-doublet model. The authors of Ref. [\cite=Low:2014cba] have simulated the signals and backgrounds for the monojet signature and the jet plus soft leptons signature. The projected 95% C.L. limit is shown by the dash-dotted line in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsd]. We find that the astrophysically favored parameter space for [formula] can be covered.

Also shown in the figure is the projected reach of the ILC with [formula], which has been evaluated by extrapolating the results of Ref. [\cite=Berggren:2013bua]. Due to its clean environment and low backgrounds, the ILC will be able to probe this model for masses of the doublet fermions, m0m  =  m+  =  mD, up to almost half of the center-of-mass energy (see long-dashed line in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsd]).

In addition to constraints from future collider experiments, the allowed parameter space of the Majorana singlet-doublet model will also be probed by upcoming direct detection experiments. The dotted red line in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsd] indicates the projected reach of the XENON1T experiment [\cite=Aprile:2012zx]. As evident from the figure, it will be able to cover large parts of the parameter space, except for very small Yukawa couplings, [formula].

The correct relic density in this model can also be achieved by annihilation of χ0l pairs through the Higgs resonance. In this case, co-annihilation does not play any role, and the other fermion states can be much heavier than the DM state, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsdh]. In this scenario, both the annihilation and the direct detection cross-sections are mediated by Higgs exchange, so that the direct detection bound from LUX [\cite=Akerib:2013tjd] becomes independent of the heavy fermion mass in this plot. It excludes part of the parameter space that produces the correct relic density.

The remaining parameter space can be probed in three ways. The [formula] signature from the process [\eqref=eq:lhcsign] can be observed if the mass difference m0m  -  m0l is sufficiently large, but the heavy states χ0m and χ± are not too heavy. The first condition ensures that the leptons can pass the trigger and selection requirements, while the second is related to the need for a large enough signal production cross-section. For LHC14 with 3000 fb- 1, we estimate its 95% C.L. exclusion limit for this signature based on simulation results from the ATLAS collaboration [\cite=ATLAS:2013hta]. To account for the smaller cross-section in the Majorana singlet-doublet model compared to the supersymmetric singlet-triplet scenario studied by ATLAS, we conservatively take the 5σ rather than the 95% C.L. contour from Fig. 10 in Ref. [\cite=ATLAS:2013hta]. For FCC-hh with [formula] and 3000 fb- 1, we adopt the results from Sec. III.C in Ref. [\cite=Gori:2014oua]. As evident from the horizontal bands in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsdh], the combination of LHC14 and FCC-hh results can cover most of the astrophysically allowed parameter space, except for relatively large values of the Yukawa coupling y.

Alternatively, this scenario can be tested by measurements of the invisible Higgs width. For χ0l  <  mh / 2, the Higgs boson can decay into pairs of DM particles, h  →  χ0lχ0l, which escape undetected. Future LHC data will be able to put strong limits on the invisible branching fraction of 17% with 300 fb- 1 and 6% with 3000 fb- 1, under somewhat favorable assumptions for the systematic errors [\cite=CMS:2013xfa]. A much more precise constraint of Br(h  →  ) < 0.3% is expected from ILC data taken at [formula] (see Tab. 2.6 in Ref. [\cite=Baer:2013cma]). The corresponding bounds on the parameter space of the model are depicted by the vertical lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsdh]. These bounds do not depend on the heavy fermion mass, m0m, since both the thermal relic density and the Higgs invisible width are governed by the same hχ0lχ0l coupling.

Finally, future direct detection searches by XENON1T [\cite=Aprile:2012zx] will probe most of the allowed parameter space, as depicted by the red dotted lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:majsdh]. Combining the projected limits from collider and direct detection experiments, only the parameter region where the DM mass is very close to half the Higgs mass, [formula], and the mediator mass is very large, [formula], will remain inaccessible.

Dirac Singlet-Doublet Model

As for the Majorana case, co-annihilation in the Dirac singlet-doublet model is active for most of the parameter points that satisfy the relic density constraint. In fact, the predicted value for Ωχ0l in this model is very sensitive to the mass difference m0h - m0l. Therefore, instead of displaying our results in the plane of m0l and m0h - m0l, we chose m0l and the Yukawa coupling y as independent variables in Fig. [\ref=fig:dirsd].

As expected, large regions of the parameter space are excluded by direct detection limits from LUX [\cite=Akerib:2013tjd] (shaded region in plot), since the doublet component of χ0l couples to the Z boson and thus leads to sizeable DM-nucleon interactions. In the remaining part of the parameter space, the mass difference m0h - m0l is small, which is illustrated by the colored solid curves in Fig. [\ref=fig:dirsd]. This bound will be improved by future results from XENON1T [\cite=Aprile:2012zx] (red dotted line in plot), but the region with small mass differences and small Yukawa couplings will remain difficult to probe by direct detection experiments. The upper left corner of the parameter space in Fig. [\ref=fig:dirsd] with large y and small m0l is also excluded by indirect searches. The 95% C.L. bound from the latest analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the Fermi satellite [\cite=Ackermann:2015zua] is shown as a long-dashed line. The gray region to the left of the line is excluded.

As explained in the previous section, scenarios with such small mass differences can be best searched for by using the hard jet plus soft leptons signature at the LHC. The expected 95% C.L. reach of LHC14 with 300 fb- 1 and 3000 fb- 1 from the analysis in Ref. [\cite=Schwaller:2013baa] is shown by the dashed and dotted lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:dirsd], respectively. These bounds have been obtained by rescaling the results of Ref. [\cite=Schwaller:2013baa] to account for the production cross-section of pp  →  χ-χ0h,  χ+0h in the Dirac singlet-doublet model. Also shown are the projected reach of FCC-hh for the jet plus soft leptons signal from the analysis of Ref. [\cite=Low:2014cba] (dash-dotted line), as well as the reach of ILC with [formula] (long-dashed line).

As is evident from the figure, LHC14 will be able to probe part of the astrophysically viable parameter space, but only for light DM with [formula]. In contrast, ILC with [formula] can extend this reach to about [formula], while FCC-hh is expected to cover the entire allowed parameter region.

Majorana Doublet-Triplet Model

In this subsection, we explore the parameter region of the Majorana doublet-triplet model for a pure doublet DM candidate, corresponding to the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:majdtx]. This scenario is characterized by sizeable mass splittings between different dark sector fermion states, so that co-annihilation is not important.

For this model, it is not possible to display our results in the plane of m0l and m0m - m0l, since for some values of m0l and m0m there are more than two possible values of y that satisfy the relic density constraint. Instead, as in the previous subsection, m0l and the Yukawa coupling y are used as independent variables. Even in this case, there is a two-fold ambiguity for the value of mT for each point in the m0l-y plane, as can be seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:majdtx] (left). These two solutions are shown in the two panels in Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt]. The solid colored curves indicate the correct relic density for different values of the relative mass difference [formula]. Notice that large values of y are constrained by vacuum stability [\cite=Dedes:2014hga].

The region with small Yukawa couplings is excluded by the relic density constraint, since the mass difference between the two doublet-dominated neutral fermion states is relatively small in this case, leading to efficient χ0l-χ0l annihilation. However, viable parameter points are obtained for larger Yukawa couplings, [formula], where the upper bound is imposed to ensure perturbativity, and for masses [formula].

As already mentioned in Sec. [\ref=sec:direct-detection], the DM-nucleon cross-section is loop-suppressed in this scenario. Nevertheless, due to the large values of the Yukawa coupling y in the viable parameter space, there are still important constraints from direct detection experiments. The bounds from LUX [\cite=Akerib:2013tjd] are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt]. With the improved sensitivity of XENON1T [\cite=Aprile:2012zx], almost the entire parameter space of the model can be covered.

At the LHC, the heavier neutral and charged fermions can be produced according to [\eqref=eq:lhcsign], leading to a [formula] signal with missing energy. Since the mass differences are relatively large in the cosmologically viable parameter region, no hard initial-state jet is required. Both ATLAS and CMS have published limits on the production cross-section from [formula] searches [\cite=Aad:2014nua] [\cite=Khachatryan:2014qwa] (see also additional material available in Ref. [\cite=Aad:2014nuaSupp]), which can be compared to the cross-section for the Majorana doublet-triplet model computed with CalcHEP. It is found that the current data from ATLAS and CMS does not lead to any limit in the parameter region shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt].

Additionally, this model is constrained by LHC data on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two photons, as discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:gamgam]. Since we require relatively light masses and large Yukawa couplings of the new fermions to obtain the correct relic density, the correction to Rγ is sizeable. In fact, one finds Rγ  <  0.6 for the whole viable parameter region shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt] (see also Ref. [\cite=Dedes:2014hga]). This is in conflict with results from ATLAS and CMS yielding Rγ  =  1.17  ±  0.27 [\cite=Aad:2014eha] and Rγ  =  1.14+ 0.26- 0.23 [\cite=Khachatryan:2014ira] at the 68% C.L., respectively. Assuming that the experimental uncertainties are Gaussian distributed, one thus finds that the Majorana doublet-triplet model with pure doublet dark matter is excluded at more than 95% C.L..

However, it is worth pointing out that the h  →  γγ branching fraction may be modified by other new physics unrelated to the DM sector, so that the Majorana doublet-triplet model may remain viable as part of a larger theory. In this case, the model can be probed more robustly through direct searches for the dark sector fermions with future LHC data. For the projected reach of [formula] searches, we use Fig. 10 in Ref. [\cite=ATLAS:2013hta]. To account for the smaller production cross-section due to the mixing between the dark fermions, we conservatively use the 5σ contour in that figure in lieu of the 95% C.L. bound. Using these results, the estimated reach of LHC14 with 300 fb- 1 is illustrated by the short-dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt]. For 3000 fb- 1, we find that the entire viable parameter region in the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt] can be excluded with [formula] data, while only a small corner in the lower left part of the right panel remains.

Conclusions

When probing the fermionic dark matter Higgs portal at colliders, the mediators cannot be integrated out, but rather must be considered as dynamical degrees of freedom. The inclusion of new signatures due to the on-shell production of the mediators can substantially extend the reach of collider searches for Higgs portal models. Using the example of three simple UV completions of the Higgs portal with scalar and fermion mediators, we have demonstrated the complementarity of direct detection experiments and high-energy colliders.

In the case of a scalar mediator, there is no direct connection between direct detection and collider observables, due to a large number of free parameters. For a singlet scalar, the observed thermal relic density can be accommodated with small Higgs-singlet mixing, especially if DM is heavier than the heavy scalar. Small mixing helps to evade direct detection bounds, as well as collider bounds from Higgs coupling measurements and direct searches for the heavier scalar. Future colliders, i.e. the HL-LHC, ILC or FCC-hh, and direct detection experiments can cover a large part of the model's parameter space. They will, however, not be able to test it conclusively.

In models with fermion mediators, obtaining the correct relic density requires either large Yukawa couplings or co-annihilation. The scenario with large Yukawa couplings is generally strongly constrained by direct detection, as are models with unsuppressed couplings to the Z boson. The co-annihilation scenario is viable for small Yukawa couplings [formula]. Since it implies small mass splittings among the lightest states, dedicated search strategies are needed at colliders. These compressed spectra can be searched for in mono-jet signatures dressed with soft leptons, which are produced in the decay chain of the mediators.

For singlet DM and a doublet fermion mediator, several scenarios can satisfy all current bounds. If DM is a Majorana fermion, Z-mediated DM-nuclei interactions are absent and the co-annihilation scenario is viable for DM-mediator mass differences of about [formula]. While the LHC can access DM masses below [formula], the scenario can be conclusively tested with XENON1T and future colliders up to TeV-scale DM masses. In the Higgs resonance region, mχ  ~  mh / 2, the correct relic density can be obtained without co-annihilation for Yukawa couplings y  ~  0.1, if mediators are below the TeV scale. The LHC (and future hadron colliders) can probe mediators up to (beyond) the TeV scale with three-lepton signatures, leaving only a small corner of parameter space that neither colliders nor XENON1T can reach.

If, in turn, DM is a Dirac fermion, the singlet-doublet model is viable only for tiny Yukawa couplings [formula], where Z-mediated DM-nuclei interactions are sufficiently suppressed to evade LUX bounds. XENON1T can probe even smaller couplings. The LHC will test the region [formula] for arbitrarily small Yukawa couplings. The ILC and FCC-hh can cover higher masses and ultimately test the model conclusively.

In a model with one doublet and one triplet fermion field, which both carry weak charges, the only viable scenario is pure-doublet DM, where Z- and Higgs-mediated DM-nuclei interactions are absent at tree level. Despite the suppression, loop-induced scattering still leads to significant constraints from direct detection searches. In addition, the model in its minimal version is already excluded by the present Higgs property measurements at the LHC, due to the contributions of charged fermions to the Higgs decay to two photons. If these can be canceled by a new contribution unrelated to the dark sector, the extended model is viable for large Yukawa couplings y  >  1 and DM masses below [formula]. XENON1T and direct searches for electroweak particles at LHC14 can cover almost the entire viable parameter space of this model.

Since the mediators in our models are generally not much heavier than the DM particles, an effective Higgs portal description is not useful. Exceptions are the Higgs resonance region in the Majorana singlet-doublet model and parts of the parameter space in the singlet-singlet model, where the DM-mediator mass splitting can be sizeable.

In summary, collider searches and direct detection experiments can pin down models with scalar mediators that have moderate mixing with the Higgs boson, and can fully explore models with fermion mediators, apart from small regions of parameter space. This is possible due to the combination of different experiments. The complementarity of probes will become even more important in the case of a discovery.

Loop-induced Higgs boson interactions with Majorana DM

In this appendix, we give analytic formulae for the loop-induced Higgs coupling to DM in the Majorana doublet-triplet model with doublet-like DM, [formula] (see Sec. [\ref=sec:doublet:triplet]). The relevant term in the Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

We have calculated the Yukawa correction δy at the one-loop level in unitarity gauge in the limit of zero momentum transfer to the Higgs boson. The result is given by

[formula]

where the couplings ghij,0 etc. are listed in Tab. [\ref=tab:sm-dm-couplings]. The loop functions can be expressed as

[formula]

[formula]

where mD = m0b is the doublet DM mass. The notation for the loop integrals A0 and B0 has been adopted from Ref. [\cite=Denner:1991kt]. Since χ0b self-energy corrections do not contribute to the hχ0bχ0b vertex at one-loop, the result for δy as given above is finite without renormalization.

We have verified that our result is gauge invariant by calculating δy in Rξ gauge and expanding the result in powers of the Higgs mass mh. The leading term δy(mh = 0) in Rξ gauge corresponds to δy in unitarity gauge. We have checked that the remainder, δy(mh) - δy(mh = 0), is numerically subleading in the parameter space where χ0b is the lightest neutral state and satisfies the relic density constraint (see Fig. [\ref=fig:majdt]). This indicates that electroweak box diagrams, which contribute to the effective scalar interaction Gqh in Eq. [\eqref=eq:dd-eff] at the same order of mh as this remainder, are suppressed with respect to the leading Higgs vertex contributions, which enter [formula] in the amplitude. Our calculation has been performed with two independent computer codes, one of which is based on the programs FeynArts [\cite=Hahn:2000kx] and FeynCalc [\cite=Mertig:1990an]. Our result agrees with Ref. [\cite=Dedes:2014hga].
