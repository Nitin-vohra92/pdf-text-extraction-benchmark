Initial-to-Interface Maps for the Heat Equation on Composite Domains

This paper is dedicated to Mark Ablowitz on the occasion of his 70th birthday, in recognition of his many important contributions to nonlinear science.

Introduction

Interface problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) are initial boundary value problems for which the solution of an equation in one domain prescribes boundary conditions for the equations in adjacent domains. In applications, conditions at the interface follow from conservations laws. Few interface problems allow for an explicit closed-form solution using classical solution methods. Using the Fokas method [\cite=FokasBook] [\cite=FokasPelloni4] such solutions may be constructed. This has been done in the case of the heat equation with n interfaces in infinite, finite, and periodic domains as well as on graphs [\cite=Asvestas] [\cite=DeconinckPelloniSheils] [\cite=SheilsDeconinck_PeriodicHeat] [\cite=SheilsSmith] [\cite=Mantzavinos]. The method has also been extended to dispersive problems [\cite=SheilsDeconinck_LS] [\cite=SheilsDeconinck_LSp], and higher order problems [\cite=DeconinckSheilsSmith]. These works construct explicit solutions in terms of given initial and boundary conditions. The value of the function at the interface is not known.

In this paper we consider the heat equation with n interfaces on domains of finite and infinite extent. The problem of heat conduction in a composite wall is a classical problem in design and construction discussed in many excellent texts, see for instance [\cite=CarslawJaeger] [\cite=HahnO]. It is usual to restrict to the case of walls whose constitutive parts are in perfect thermal contact and have physical properties that are constant throughout the material and that are considered to be of infinite extent in the directions parallel to the wall. Further, we assume that temperature and heat flux do not vary in these directions. In that case, the mathematical model for heat conduction in each wall layer is given by [\cite=HahnO]: here u(j)(x,t) denotes the temperature in the wall layer indexed by (j), αj > 0 is the heat-conduction coefficient of the j-th layer, x = xj - 1 is the left extent of the layer, and x = xj is its right extent. The sub-indices denote derivatives with respect to the one-dimensional spatial variable x and the temporal variable t. The function u(j)0(x) is the prescribed initial condition of the system. The continuity of the temperature u(j) and of its associated heat flux αju(j)x are imposed across the interface between layers. In what follows it is convenient to use the quantity σj, defined as the positive square root of αj: [formula].

If the layer is either at the far left or far right of the wall, Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin boundary conditions can be imposed on its far left or right boundary respectively, corresponding to prescribing "outside" temperature, heat flux, or a combination of these. A derivation of the interface boundary conditions is found in [\cite=HahnO]. It should be noted that the set-up presented in [\eqref=heatgeneral] also applies to the case of one-dimensional rods in thermal contact. Even for the simple problem of two finite walls in thermal contact, the classical approach using separation of variables [\cite=HahnO] can provide only an implicit answer. Indeed, the solution obtained in [\cite=HahnO] depends on certain eigenvalues defined through a transcendental equation that can be solved only numerically. In contrast, the Fokas Method produces an explicit solution formula involving only known quantities.

The construction of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, that is, determining the boundary values that are not prescribed in terms of the initial and boundary conditions, is important in the study of PDEs and particularly inverse problems [\cite=Fokas8] [\cite=SylvesterUhlmann]. In what follows we construct a similar map between the initial values of the PDE and the function (and some number of spatial derivatives) evaluated at the interface. This map allows for an alternative to the approach of finding solutions to interface problems as presented in earlier papers using the Fokas method by the authors and others. This would be most useful in the case where one is interested only in the behavior of solutions at the interface. The method presented here can be extended in a straightforward way to many other interface problems. To our knowledge, no such maps currently exist.

Given the initial conditions, one could find the value of the function and its derivatives at the interface(s) using these maps. This changes the problem at hand from an interface problem to a collection of independent boundary value problems (BVPs). At this point, the BVPs could be solved using any number of methods appropriate for the given problem. Each BVP would be over-specified, however, by construction it is clear that the corresponding spectral functions are admissible [\cite=FokasPelloni2001], i.e. the data is mutually compatible.

The heat equation on an infinite domain with n interfaces

Consider

[formula]

together with the initial condition u0(x) = u(x,0) and the asymptotic conditions lim |x|  →    ∞u(x,t) = 0, where -    ∞   < x <   ∞  , 0 < t < T, and

[formula]

The restriction lim |x|  →    ∞u(x,t) = 0 can easily be made more general as in [\cite=DeconinckPelloniSheils].

We can rewrite [\eqref=n_heat] as the set of equations

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1 where x0 =  -   ∞   and xn + 1  =    ∞  . We impose the continuity interface conditions [\cite=DeconinckPelloniSheils] [\cite=Kevorkian]

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. These interface conditions follow from conservation laws and are fully derived [\cite=SheilsThesis]. Since u(j)(x,t) is defined on the open interval xj - 1 < x < xj, when we write u(j)(xj,t) we mean lim x  →  x-ju(j)(x,t). Similarly, we denote lim x  →  x+ju(j + 1)(x,t) by u(j + 1)(xj,t). Without loss of generality we shift the problem so x1 = 0. Using the usual steps of the Fokas method [\cite=FokasBook] [\cite=FokasPelloni4] [\cite=DeconinckTrogdonVasan] we have the local relations

[formula]

where ωj(k) = (σjk)2. These relations are a one-parameter family obtained by rewriting [\eqref=I2I_nheat].

Integrating over the appropriate cells of the domain (see Figure [\ref=fig:GR_domain_ni]) and applying Green's Theorem we find the global relations

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. Define [formula], DR  =  {k∈D:|k| > R}, and [formula] as in Figure [\ref=fig:heat_DRpm] where R > 0 is an arbitrary finite constant. Since |x| can become arbitrarily large for j = 1 and j = n + 1, we require [formula] when j = 1 and [formula] when j = n + 1, in Equation [\eqref=nGR] in order to guarantee that the integrals are defined. For 2  ≤  j  ≤  n, [\eqref=nGR] is valid for [formula]. The dispersion relation ωj(k) = (σjk)2 is invariant under the symmetry k  →   - k. We supplement the n + 1 global relations above with their evaluation at - k, namely,

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. When j = 1, [\eqref=nGR_minus] is valid for [formula]. Similarly, for j = n + 1, [\eqref=nGR_minus] is valid for [formula]. For 2  ≤  j  ≤  n, [\eqref=nGR_minus] is valid for all [formula]. Without loss of generality we choose to work with the equations valid in the upper half plane. Define

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Using the change of variables k = κ  /  σj on the [formula] equation, the global relations valid in the upper-half plane are for 2  ≤  j  ≤  n. Equation [\eqref=heatn_GRu] can be written as a linear system for the interface values:

[formula]

where and

The matrix A(κ) consists of four n  ×  n blocks as indicated by the dashed lines. The two blocks in the upper half of A(κ) are zero except for entries on the main and - 1 diagonals. The lower two blocks of A(κ) only have nonzero entries on the main and + 1 diagonals. The matrix A(κ) is singular for isolated values of κ. Asymptotically, for large |κ|, the zeros of det (A(κ)) lie within a strip parallel to the real line [\cite=Langer]. Since asymptotically there are no zeros in D+R, a sufficiently large R may be chosen such that A(κ) is nonsingular for every κ∈D+R and [formula].

Using Cramer's Rule to solve this system, we have where 1  ≤  j  ≤  n and Aj(κ,T) is the matrix A(κ) with the [formula] column replaced by Y + Y. This does not give an effective initial-to-interface map because [\eqref=I2I_g01solns] depends on the solutions û(j)(  ·  ,T). To eliminate this dependence we multiply [\eqref=I2I_g01solns] by κe-  κ2t and integrate around D+R, as is typical in the construction of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps [\cite=FokasBook]. Switching the order of integration we have Using the change of variables [formula] and the classical Fourier transform formula for the delta function we have

To examine the right-hand-side of [\eqref=I2I_INTg01solns] we factor the matrix A(κ) as AL(κ)AM(κ) where is a diagonal matrix. The elements of AM(κ) are either 0, O(κ), or decaying exponentially fast for κ∈D+R. Hence,

[formula]

for large κ in D+R. Now, det (A(κ)) = c(κ) det (AL(κ)) as κ  →    ∞   for κ∈D+R. Similarly, factor Aj(κ,T) = AL(κ)AMj(κ,T)ARj(κ,T) where ARj(κ,T) is the 2n  ×  2n identity matrix with the (j,j) component replaced by eκ2T. Then det (Aj(κ,T)) = eκ2T det (AL(κ)) det (AMj(κ,T)). Thus, the integrand we are considering in [\eqref=I2I_INTg01solns] is

[formula]

The elements of AMj(κ,T) are the same as those in AM(κ) except in the [formula] column. Expanding the determinant of AMj(κ,T) along the [formula] column we see that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] for [formula]. The terms involving [formula], the solutions of our equation, are decaying exponentially for κ∈D+R. Thus, by Jordan's Lemma [\cite=AblowitzFokas], the integral of this term along a closed, bounded curve in [formula] vanishes. In particular we consider the closed curve [formula] where [formula] and L+C  =  {k∈D+R:|k| = C}, see Figure [\ref=fig:heat_Dpm_close]. Since the integral along L+C vanishes for large C, [\eqref=badstuff] must vanish since the contour LD+R becomes ∂D+R as C  →    ∞  .

Since the terms involving the elements of Y(κ,T) evaluate to zero in the solution expression we have the solution for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1, where Aj(κ) is the matrix A(κ) with the [formula] column replaced by Y(κ). Equation [\ref=I2I_INTg01solns_final] is an effective map between the values of the function at the interface and the given initial conditions.

Remark. Note that since the problem is linear, one could have assumed the initial condition was zero for x outside the region [formula]. Then, the map would be in terms of just [formula]. Summing over [formula] would give the complete map for a general initial condition.

As an example of a specific initial-to-interface map we consider the equation [\eqref=n_heat] with n = 1. Using [\eqref=I2I_INTg01solns_final] we have

[formula]

In this case we can deform D+R back to the real line with no pole contributions. Switching the order of integration and evaluating the κ integral we have which is an explicit map from the initial data to the value of the temperature and its associated flux at the interface, x = 0. If one allows σ1  =  σ2 the problem is simply that of the heat equation on the whole line. Equation [\eqref=1heat] with σ1  =  σ2 is exactly the Green's Function solution of the whole line problem evaluated at x = 0 [\cite=Kevorkian].

The heat equation on a finite domain with n interfaces

Consider [\eqref=n_heat] on a finite domain, x0  ≤  x  ≤  xn + 1, with the boundary conditions As before, we rewrite [\eqref=n_heat] as the set of equations

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1, subject to the continuity interface conditions

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Without loss of generality we shift the problem so that x0 = 0.

The following steps are very similar to those presented in the previous section. In what follows we give a brief outline of the changes needed to solve on a finite domain.

Integrating the local relations [\eqref=I2I_heatn_local] around the appropriate domain (see Figure [\ref=fig:GR_domain_ni]) and applying Green's Theorem we find the global relations [\eqref=nGR] and their evaluation at - k [\eqref=nGR_minus]. In contrast to Section [\ref=sec:I2I_nheat_i], these 2n + 2 global relations are all valid for [formula]. In addition to the definitions in Section [\ref=sec:I2I_nheat_i] we define

[formula]

for m = 1,2. Using the change of variables k = κ  /  σj, the n + 1 global relations are for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1 where we define σ0  =  σ1 for convenience. These equations, together with the boundary values [\eqref=I2I_bcs], can be written as a linear system for the interface values

[formula]

where The matrix AF(κ) is made up of four (n + 2)  ×  (n + 2) blocks as indicated by the dashed lines. The two blocks in the upper half of AF(κ) are zero except for entries on the main and - 1 diagonals. The lower two blocks of AF(κ) only have entries on the main and + 1 diagonals.

As before we use Cramer's Rule to solve this system. After multiplying the solutions by κe-  κ2t, integrating around D+R, and simplifying as in the previous section we follow a similar process to show the terms from YF(κ,T) do not contribute to our solution formula using Jordan's Lemma and Cauchy's Theorem. One can show that AFj(κ,T) can be replaced by AFj(κ,t) by writing [formula] as [formula] and noticing where the function in analytic and decaying. If the boundary conditions [\eqref=I2I_bcs] are time-independent then so is AFj.

In general, the initial-to-interface map for the heat equation on a finite domain with n interfaces is given by for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1, where AFj(κ,t) is the matrix AF(κ,t) with the [formula] column replaced by YF(κ,t).

As an example of a specific initial-to-interface map we consider [\eqref=n_heat] on a finite domain with n = 1 with boundary conditions

[formula]

and zero initial conditions

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. Using [\eqref=I2I_INTg01solns_final_f] we have

[formula]
