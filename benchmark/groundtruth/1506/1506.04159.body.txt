Bekenstein bounds and inequalities between size, charge, angular momentum and energy for bodies

Introduction

A universal bound on the entropy of a macroscopic body has been proposed by Bekenstein [\cite=Bekenstein:1980jp]

[formula]

where S is the entropy, kB is Boltzmann's constant, R is the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose the body, E is the total energy, [formula] is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. Using a similar kind of heuristic arguments, a generalization of ([\ref=eq:3]) including the electric charge Q and the angular momentum J of the body has been also proposed [\cite=Hod:2000ju] [\cite=Zaslavskii92] [\cite=Bekenstein:1999cf]

[formula]

The original physical arguments used to present these inequalities involve black holes. However, a remarkable feature of these inequalities is that the gravitational constant G does not appear in them.

The bound ([\ref=eq:3]) has been extensively studied, see, for example, the review articles [\cite=Bekenstein:2004sh], [\cite=Bousso:2002ju], [\cite=Wald01] and references therein. However, the generalization ([\ref=eq:6]) appears to have received much less attention. In particular, since the entropy S is always non-negative, the bound ([\ref=eq:6]) implies the following inequality in which the entropy S and the constant [formula] are not involved

[formula]

Equality in [\eqref=eq:76] implies, by ([\ref=eq:6]), that the entropy of the body is zero and hence the system should be in a very particular state. Then, we expect some kind of rigidity statement for the equality in ([\ref=eq:76]).

The main purpose of this article is to study inequality ([\ref=eq:76]). The only fundamental constant that appears in [\eqref=eq:76] is c. Hence, the obvious theory to test inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) is Electromagnetism. To the best of our knowledge, such basic study, in full generality, has not been done before. In section [\ref=sec:electromagnetism] we prove that [\eqref=eq:76] holds as a consequence of Maxwell equations. This theorem provides an indirect but highly non-trivial evidence in favor of the bound ([\ref=eq:6]).

In section [\ref=sec:general-relativity] we first discuss the relation of the inequality [\eqref=eq:76] with inequalities between size, angular momentum and charge recently studied in General Relativity [\cite=Dain:2013gma]. Then, we point out that a result of Reiris [\cite=Reiris:2014tva] proves inequality [\eqref=eq:76] in spherical symmetry in General Relativity. Finally, we generalize this result and prove inequality [\eqref=eq:76], with J = 0, for time-symmetric initial data.

Electromagnetism

To fix the notation, let us write Maxwell's equations in Gaussian units

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] are the electric and magnetic field, and ρ, [formula] are the charge and current density. These equations are written in terms of inertial coordinates [formula] where t is the time coordinate and [formula] are spatial coordinates centered at an arbitrary point x0.

Let U be an arbitrary region in space. The electric charge contained in U is given by

[formula]

and the energy of the electromagnetic field in U is

[formula]

The angular momentum in the region U in the direction of the unit vector [formula] with respect to the point x0 is given by

[formula]

Finally, in order to study inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) we need to provide a definition of the radius R for an arbitrary region U.

We define the radius R of the region U as the the radius of the smallest sphere that encloses U.

Given a domain U, we denote by BR the smallest ball that encloses U and x0 denote the center of this ball. Note that, in general, x0 is not in U, see figure [\ref=fig:1]. We denote by ∂BR the boundary of [formula], that is, the sphere of radius R centered at x0.

Before dealing with the general case, it is useful to begin with Electrostatics, which in particular implies J = 0. We will see that the proof for the dynamical case is based on the proof for the Electrostatics case. Also, in Electrostatics is simpler to discuss the scope of inequality ([\ref=eq:76]).

The equations of Electrostatics are given by

[formula]

The potential Φ is defined by [formula] and it satisfies the Poisson equation

[formula]

Using equation ([\ref=eq:17]) and Gauss's theorem we obtain that the charge can be written as boundary integral

[formula]

where ∂n denote partial derivative along the exterior unit normal vector of the boundary ∂U. The total Electrostatics energy is given by

[formula]

Assume that the charge density ρ has compact support contained in the region U. In Electrostatics (i.e. we assume equations ([\ref=eq:14])), the following inequality holds

[formula]

where Q is the charge contained in U, R is the radius of U defined above and E is the total electromagnetic energy given by ([\ref=eq:15]). The equality in ([\ref=eq:5]) holds if and only if the electric field is equal to the electric field produced by an spherical thin shell of constant surface charge density and radius R. In particular, this implies that the electric field vanished inside U.

The system has electric field [formula] (with potential Φ), charge density ρ with support in U and total charge Q. Let R be the radius of the domain U defined in [\ref=d:R] and BR its corresponding ball centered at x0.

Consider the following auxiliary potential defined by

[formula]

where r is the radial distance to x0. The potential Φ0 corresponds to the potential of an spherical thin shell of radius R, constant surface charge density and total charge Q.

Define Φ1 by the difference

[formula]

By construction Φ1 satisfies

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:60]) follows since in the definition of Φ0 we have used the total charge Q of the potential Φ.

The total energy of the system is given by

[formula]

where in line ([\ref=eq:61b]) we have used the definition ([\ref=eq:58]). To calculate the last term in ([\ref=eq:61b]) we decompose the domain of the integral in [formula] and [formula]. We have

[formula]

since Φ0 is constant in BR. For the other integral we have

[formula]

Since ΔΦ1 = 0 on [formula] the second term in the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:63]) vanishes. The first term can be converted in a boundary integral

[formula]

The first term on the right hand side of equation ([\ref=eq:8]) vanishes by the decay conditions of Φ0 and Φ1. For the second term we have

[formula]

Where in line ([\ref=eq:9]) we have used that Φ0 is constant on spheres and in line ([\ref=eq:9bc]) we have used ([\ref=eq:60]). Hence, we have proved that

[formula]

The first term in ([\ref=eq:10]) can be computed explicitly using ([\ref=eq:11]). It is the binding energy of an spherical shell of radius R with constant charge surface density and total charge Q. Then, we finally obtain

[formula]

This equality proves inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) and also the rigidity statement: if the equality in ([\ref=eq:5]) holds, then ([\ref=eq:18]) implies [formula] and hence [formula].

Note that the equality ([\ref=eq:18]) implies the following estimate for the fields inside the domain U

[formula]

where we have used that in U we have [formula].

Let us discuss the scope of inequality ([\ref=eq:5]). The first important observation is that in inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) the energy E is the total energy of the system, which in electrostatic is equivalent to the binding energy. That is, E represents the work needed to assemble the charge configuration from infinity. Inequality is clearly false if instead of the total energy we use the integral of the energy density on the domain U given by ([\ref=eq:26]): for example, take the spherical shell of radius R and constant surface charge density. Then, the domain U is given by the ball [formula], but the integral of the energy density over [formula] is zero since the electric field vanishes in [formula].

Inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) is not valid if we consider many disconnected regions and take Q and R to be the corresponding radius and charge of only one region and E the total energy of the system. The counterexample is the following. Consider two spherical thin shells of constant surface density with radius R1 and R2 and total charge Q and - Q. The separation between the centers is L, and we assume that they do not overlap, i.e. L  ≥  R1  +  R2. The total energy of this system is given by

[formula]

where the self energy of each shell is given by

[formula]

For a simple way to compute the third term in ([\ref=eq:29]) (namely, the interaction energy) see, for example [\cite=zangwill2013modern] p. 75. At the contact point L = R1 + R2 we have

[formula]

Take R2 > R1, then if the shells are close enough to the contact point, from ([\ref=eq:1]) we deduce that

[formula]

But then

[formula]

and hence inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) is not valid for the shell R1 if we take in ([\ref=eq:5]) E as the total energy and Q and R as the charge and radius of the shell.

An alternative and useful way to prove inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) in electrostatic is the following. By Thomson's theorem the electrostatic energy of a body of fixed shape, size and charge is minimized when its charge Q distributes itself to make the electrostatic potential constant throughout the body (see, for example, [\cite=zangwill2013modern] p. 128). That is, the original configuration is replaced by a conductor with the same total charge and size which has less or equal energy. For conductors inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) is related with the capacity of the conductor, defined as follows. Consider a conductor U and define the potential Φ1 by

[formula]

The capacity of U is given by

[formula]

The capacity C satisfies the well-known relation

[formula]

where E is the total electrostatic energy of the conductor. Then, for a conductor, inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) is equivalent to

[formula]

Since, by Thomson's theorem conductors minimize the energy, we have proved that inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) for general configurations reduces to the inequality [\eqref=eq:70] for conductors.

To prove [\eqref=eq:70] we use the variational characterization of C

[formula]

where K is the set of all functions Φ that decay at infinity and are equal to 1 at ∂U. Consider the following test function

[formula]

We have that ΦR∈K and hence we can use ([\ref=eq:8]) to obtain

[formula]

This characterization in terms of the capacity is useful to find interesting examples and estimates. In particular it allows to prove the following relevant statement: inequality [\eqref=eq:5] is not valid if we replace the definition of R by the area radius, namely

[formula]

where A is the area of the boundary ∂U. Note that the area radius RA represents perhaps the simplest definition of radius that can be directly translated into curved spaces. The following counterexample shows that even in flat space RA is not an appropriate measure of size in our context.

Consider a prolate conducting ellipsoid with radius a and b with a > b. The capacity of this conductor is given by (see [\cite=landau1984electrodynamics], p. 22)

[formula]

and the surface area is given by

[formula]

We calculate the dimensionless quotient

[formula]

Note that C / RA depends only on the dimensionless parameter a / b. We take the limit a / b  →    ∞

[formula]

And hence inequality ([\ref=eq:70]) is not satisfied for RA.

With this example we conclude the study of inequality ([\ref=eq:5]) in Electrostatics. From now on, we will deal with the full Maxwell's equations ([\ref=eq:32])-([\ref=eq:32v]). As a preliminary step, we prove inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) with Q = 0 and J  ≠  0. This particular case will also be used in the general proof of inequality ([\ref=eq:76]).

Consider a solution of Maxwell's equations ([\ref=eq:32])-([\ref=eq:32v]) in the domain U. Let R be the radius of U defined in [\ref=d:R] and let x0 be the center of the corresponding sphere. Then the following inequality holds

[formula]

where J(U) is the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field given by ([\ref=eq:24]) with respect to the point x0. Moreover, the equality in ([\ref=eq:27]) holds if and only if the electromagnetic field vanishes in U.

Note that inequality ([\ref=eq:27]) is purely quasilocal, in contrast with the previous inequality ([\ref=eq:5]): in ([\ref=eq:27]) there appears only quantities defined on the domain U and not global quantities like the total energy E. Of course, since E  ≥  E(U), inequality ([\ref=eq:27]) implies the global inequality

[formula]

Moreover, theorem [\ref=t:ejr] implies also a rigidity statement for the inequality ([\ref=eq:44]): equality holds if and only if the electromagnetic field vanishes everywhere.

We estimate the difference

[formula]

The integrand of the angular momentum (i.e. the angular momentum density) satisfies the elementary inequality

[formula]

where in line ([\ref=eq:28]) we used the inequality [formula], in line ([\ref=eq:28a]) we used that [formula] is an unit vector and in line ([\ref=eq:28b]) we used the inequality [formula]. Using this inequality, we obtain

[formula]

We write the right hand side of the inequality as follows

[formula]

Collecting these inequalities we arrive to our final result

[formula]

By the definition of R we have [formula] on U, and hence the integrand on the right hand side of inequality ([\ref=eq:7]) is non-negative. This proves ([\ref=eq:27]). Moreover, inequality [\eqref=eq:7] also proves the rigidity statement: if equality holds, then the integrand on the right hand side of inequality ([\ref=eq:7]) should vanish. Then, for every [formula] that is not on the sphere [formula] we have that both [formula] and [formula] are zero. By continuity, the fields are also zero on the points on the sphere [formula]

The proof of inequality ([\ref=eq:27]) (but not the rigidity statement) can be directly generalized to any classical field theory. It is a direct consequence of the dominant energy condition. Let Tμν be the electromagnetic energy momentum tensor of the theory. The indices [formula] are 4-dimensional and we are using signature ( -  +  +  + ). For example, for electromagnetism we have

[formula]

where Fμν is the (antisymmetric) electromagnetic field tensor that satisfies Maxwell's equations. Consider a spacelike surface U with normal tμ. The energy is given by

[formula]

Let ημ be a Killing vector field that corresponds to space rotations. The angular momentum corresponding to the rotation ημ is given by

[formula]

Choosing coordinates such that xi are spacelike Cartesian coordinates on the surface U and tμ = (1,0,0,0), then the space rotations are characterized by

[formula]

where k is an arbitrary constant spacelike unit vector that represent the axis of rotation and the indices [formula] are 3-dimensional. For the case of the electromagnetism, it is easy to check, using ([\ref=eq:4b]), that the definition ([\ref=eq:13]) coincides with ([\ref=eq:24]).

Assume that Tμν satisfies the dominant energy condition, namely

[formula]

for all future directed timelike or null vectors kμ and ξμ.

Denote by η the square norm of ηi, that is η  =  ηiηi  =  ημημ and define the unit vector μ  =  ημη- 1 / 2. Then, the vector

[formula]

is null future directed (since tμημ = 0 ). Choosing ξμ = tμ and kμ given by ([\ref=eq:52]), from ([\ref=eq:32]) we obtain

[formula]

Since η is the square of the distance to the axis, we have that

[formula]

where R is the radius a the ball that encloses U. Hence we deduce

[formula]

Hence, we have proved inequality ([\ref=eq:27]) for a general energy momentum tensor that satisfies the dominant energy condition ([\ref=eq:32b]). Note, however, that we have not proved the rigidity statement as in theorem [\ref=t:ejr].

Finally, we prove inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) for Electromagnetism in full generality.

Assume that ρ(x,t0), for some t0, has compact support contained in U. Consider a solution of Maxwell's equations ([\ref=eq:32])-([\ref=eq:32v]) that decay at infinity. Then the following inequality holds at t0

[formula]

In particular, inequality [\eqref=eq:5c] implies

[formula]

Moreover, if the equality in ([\ref=eq:5c]) holds, then the electromagnetic field is that produced by a electrostatic spherical thin shell of radius R and charge Q. For that case, the magnetic field vanished everywhere and hence J = 0.

Consider the Coulomb gauge

[formula]

where the potential [formula] satisfies the Coulomb gauge condition

[formula]

In this gauge, the total energy can be written in the following form

[formula]

where in line [\eqref=eq:49b] we have used the expression [\eqref=eq:35] for the electric field in terms of the potential [formula]. For the second term in the integrand of ([\ref=eq:49b]) we use the identity

[formula]

where in line [\eqref=eq:51b] we have used the Coulomb gauge condition ([\ref=eq:45]). Using the asymptotic falloff conditions for Φ and [formula] and Gauss theorem, from [\eqref=eq:51b] we obtain

[formula]

Then, we have the following expression for the total energy

[formula]

The potential Φ(x,t) satisfies the Poisson equation

[formula]

for all t. At a fixed t, we can perform the same decomposition ([\ref=eq:58]) for the potential Φ(x,t) used in theorem [\ref=t:1]. Then, using equation ([\ref=eq:18]), we obtain

[formula]

where Φ1 is defined by ([\ref=eq:58]) and ([\ref=eq:11]). By the same integration by parts argument used to deduce ([\ref=eq:56]) we obtain that

[formula]

Hence, we can write the energy ([\ref=eq:22c]) in the following way

[formula]

We decompose the integral in ([\ref=eq:65]) over the domains [formula] and U and we use the following simple but important identity

[formula]

where in line ([\ref=eq:50v]) we have used that [formula] in U since Φ0 is constant in U. And in line [\eqref=eq:50vv] we have used the expression for the electric field in the Coulomb gauge ([\ref=eq:35]). Then we obtain the following expression for the energy E

[formula]

where E(U) is the electromagnetic energy density integrated over the domain U, namely

[formula]

We use theorem [\ref=t:ejr] to bound E(U) (i.e. the estimate ([\ref=eq:7])) and we finally have

[formula]

Since the left hand side of ([\ref=eq:20]) is non-negative we have proved the inequality [\eqref=eq:5c]. Inequality ([\ref=eq:20]) implies also the rigidity statement. Assume the equality in [\eqref=eq:5c], then the integrand on the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:20]) should vanish. This implies that [formula] everywhere, and hence the potential [formula] is a gradient. Using equation ([\ref=eq:45]) and the falloff condition for [formula] we deduce that [formula]. Then, using again ([\ref=eq:20]) we obtain that [formula] and hence the statement is proved.

Taking the square of inequality [\eqref=eq:5c], we obtain

[formula]

which, in particular, implies inequality [\eqref=eq:69].

General Relativity

In this section we study inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) in General Relativity. In section [\ref=sec:scam] we discuss a remarkably relation between this inequality and inequalities between size, charge and angular momentum. In section [\ref=sec:proofgr] we present a proof of inequality ([\ref=eq:76]), with J = 0, for time-symmetric initial conditions.

Inequalities between size, charge and angular momentum

For a black hole the entropy is given by the horizon area A

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=eq:6] is constructed in such a way that for a Kerr-Newman black hole, using the formula [\eqref=eq:1v], we get an equality. Moreover, Szabados [\cite=Szabados04] observed that for dynamical black holes this inequality is also expected to hold. It is the generalization of the Penrose inequality including charge and angular momentum (see the review article [\cite=Mars:2009cj] and [\cite=Dain:2014xda] [\cite=dain12] and the discussion therein)

For ordinary bodies, inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) is closely related to inequalities between size, angular momentum and charge recently studied in [\cite=Dain:2013gma]. To show this relation we argue as follows. The Hoop conjecture essentially says that if matter is enclosed in a sufficiently small region, then the system should collapse to a black hole [\cite=thorne72]. Then if the body is not a black hole we expect an inequality of the form

[formula]

where k is an universal dimensionless constant of order one. The exact value of k will depend on the precise formulation of the Hoop conjecture and this is not important in what follows.

Using ([\ref=eq:37]) to bound E in ([\ref=eq:76]) we obtain

[formula]

Note that the constant G appears in ([\ref=eq:2]). That is, inequality ([\ref=eq:2]) involves two fundamental constants (c and G), in contrast to ([\ref=eq:76]) that involves only one (c). On the other hand inequality ([\ref=eq:2]) involves fewer physical quantities (charge, angular momentum and size) than inequality ([\ref=eq:76]) (charge, angular momentum, size and energy).

The bound [\eqref=eq:2] implies

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=eq:38] was conjectured in [\cite=Dain:2013gma] using different kind of arguments as those leading to ([\ref=eq:76]). With an appropriate definition of size, a version of this inequality was proved for constant density bodies in [\cite=Dain:2013gma]. Recently Khuri [\cite=Khuri:2015zla] has proved it in the general case, using the same measure of size as in [\cite=Dain:2013gma]. However, these inequalities are not expected to be sharp. We will came back to this point bellow.

Also from [\eqref=eq:2] we get the inequality

[formula]

This inequality can be also deduced using similar arguments as in [\cite=Dain:2013gma] and it was studied for some particular examples in [\cite=Rubio14]. Recently Khuri [\cite=Khuri:2015xpa] has proved a general version of inequality [\eqref=eq:4] using a similar (but not identical) measure of size as the one used in inequality [\eqref=eq:38]. As in the case of angular momentum, this result is not expected to be sharp.

The relation between the Bekenstein bounds and inequalities [\eqref=eq:38] and [\eqref=eq:4] provides two important new insights. The first one is the following. We pointed out that in that inequality [\eqref=eq:38] was conjectured in [\cite=Dain:2013gma] using heuristic physical arguments and also the inequality [\eqref=eq:4] can be deduced using similar kind of arguments. However, with these arguments inequalities [\eqref=eq:38] and [\eqref=eq:4] are deduced individually. These kind of arguments do not seem to provide a way of deducing the complete inequality [\eqref=eq:2], which is obtained here for first time using the Bekenstein bounds. Moreover, the arguments presented above suggest that there is only one universal constant k to be fixed. This constant can be fixed analyzing a simple limit case, for example spherical symmetry, with J = 0. We are currently working on this problem [\cite=anglada14].

The second, and perhaps most important point concerns the rigidity of the inequality [\eqref=eq:2]. The arguments presented in [\cite=Dain:2013gma] do not give any insight about what happens when equality is reached in [\eqref=eq:2]. The Bekenstein bounds provide such statement. Let assume that the equality is reached in [\eqref=eq:2]. Since we have assumed that it is not a black hole we can use the Hoop conjecture inequality [\eqref=eq:37] to obtain

[formula]

But then we can use inequality [\eqref=eq:76] to conclude that if the equality is reached in [\eqref=eq:2] then the equality should also hold in [\eqref=eq:76]. By the Bekenstein bound [\eqref=eq:6], this implies that the entropy of the body is zero. Hence we have the following rigidity statement for inequality [\eqref=eq:2]: the equality is achieved if and only the entropy of the body is zero. In General Relativity, this statement appears to imply that in fact the equality is achieved if and only if the spacetime is flat. We will further discuss this point in the next section.

Proof of the inequality between charge, energy and size for time-symmetric initial data

In General Relativity, the inequality ([\ref=eq:2]) was proved in spherical symmetry (in a different context) by Reiris [\cite=Reiris:2014tva]. In the following we generalize this result to time-symmetric initial data.

The most important difficulty to study these kind of inequalities in curved spaces is how to define the measure of size R. We propose a new measure of size which is tailored to the proof of theorem [\ref=t:GR]. This measure of size represents a natural generalization to curved spaces of the definition [\ref=d:R] used in section [\ref=sec:electromagnetism].

The definition of size and the proof of the theorem is based on the inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF). A family of 2-surfaces on a Riemannian manifold evolves under the IMCF if the outward normal speed at which a point on the surface moves is given by the reciprocal of the mean curvature of the surface. For the precise definition and properties of the IMCF we refer to [\cite=Huisken01]. The IMCF has played a key role in the proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality [\cite=Huisken01].

Using the IMCF we define the following radius R of a region U in a Riemannian manifold

Consider a region U on a complete, asymptotically flat, Riemannian manifold. Take a point x0 on the manifold and consider the inverse mean curvature flow starting at this point. Consider the area of the first 2-surface on the flow that encloses the region U, and define Rx0 to be the area radius of this surface. The radius R of the region U is defined as the infimum of Rx0 over all points x0 on the manifold.

In figure [\ref=fig:2] we draw an schematic picture of the flow starting at a typical point x0. In flat space, the IMCF starting at a point develop spheres, and hence the definition [\ref=d:imcf] coincides with the definition [\ref=d:R] presented in the previous section. However, we emphasize that this definition is very different as the one used in [\cite=Dain:2013gma] [\cite=Khuri:2015zla] [\cite=Khuri:2015xpa].

The radius R defined above certainly involves sophisticated mathematics, however it is important to recall that it can be explicitly estimated numerically for arbitrary curved backgrounds.

It is important to recall that, in general, the flow will develop singularities. These singular behaviour can be treated using the weak formulation discovered in [\cite=Huisken01]. In what follows, for simplicity of the presentation, we will assume that the flow is smooth, however all the arguments are also valid in the weak formulation.

We have the following result.

Consider an asymptotically flat, complete, time-symmetric initial for Einstein's equations that satisfy the dominant energy condition and with no minimal surfaces. Assume that there is a region U outside of which the data are electrovacuum. Then we have

[formula]

where E is the ADM mass, Q is the charge contained in U and R is the radius of U defined above. Moreover, if the equality in ([\ref=eq:36]) holds, then the data is flat inside the region U.

The proof is inspired in Reiris's proof [\cite=Reiris:2014tva] and it is a simple consequence of the results presented in [\cite=Jang79] and [\cite=Huisken01].

The crucial property of the IMCF is the Geroch monotonicity of the Hawking energy. The Hawking energy of a closed 2-surface S is given by

[formula]

where H is the mean curvature of the surface and A its area. The Geroch monotonicity can be written in the following form. Assume that the flow runs between a surface Sr and a surface Ss, with r < s, then we have

[formula]

where R is the scalar curvature. Note that the dominant energy condition for time-symmetric data implies that R  ≥  0. We will use inequality ([\ref=eq:41]) in two steps.

First, consider an arbitrary point x0 and run the IMCF from x0. Since the data satisfy the dominant energy condition, an small sphere around x0 has non-negative Hawking mass. Moreover, the assumption that there are no minimal surfaces on the data guarantees that the flow runs up to infinity (even in the presence of singularities, see [\cite=Huisken01]). Then, using ([\ref=eq:41]) we conclude that any level set of the flow has non-negative Hawking energy. In particular, the surface Sx0 that encloses the region U used in the definition [\ref=d:imcf], that is

[formula]

Denote by Ax0 the area of Sx0 and the area radius is given by [formula].

In the second step, we continue the flow from the surface Sx0 to infinity. Following [\cite=Jang79], we bound the integral of the scalar curvature in terms of the charge

[formula]

where we have used that the charge is conserved outside Sx0, since by construction Sx0 encloses the region U and by assumption the support of the charge density is contained in U. Using ([\ref=eq:77]) and ([\ref=eq:41]) we obtain

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:43]) we finally get

[formula]

In particular this inequality applies to the radius R and hence inequality ([\ref=eq:36]) follows.

If the equality holds in ([\ref=eq:42]), then we have EH(Sx0) = 0 and hence we can use the same rigidity argument as in [\cite=Huisken01] to conclude that inside Sx0 the data are flat.

We have obtained a similar kind of estimate as in the electromagnetic case [\eqref=eq:12] in which EH(S0) is interpreted as the quasilocal energy inside S0.

Comparing theorem [\ref=t:GR] with theorem [\ref=t:em] in Electromagnetism, we see that there is no rigidity statement outside the region U in theorem [\ref=t:GR]. The natural question is whether a similar statement as in theorem [\ref=t:em] holds, namely, the equality implies that the field is produced by a charged thin shell. However, it is likely that the charged thin shell in General Relativity never saturate the inequality (in contrast with Electromagnetism). The reason is that the rest energy of the shell is now taken into account. Hence, a stronger rigidity statement is expected for theorem [\ref=t:GR]: the equality holds if and only if the complete data are flat. We are currently working on this problem [\cite=anglada14].

It will interesting to include angular momentum in theorem [\ref=t:GR]. However, this appears to be a difficult problem. In particular it is not clear how to include angular momentum in the inequality using the IMCF.
