Classical Simulation of Quantum Error Correction in a Fibonacci Anyon Code

Topologically ordered quantum systems in two dimensions show tremendous promise for long-term storage and processing of quantum information [\cite=Kitaev2003] [\cite=Dennis2002] [\cite=Nayak2008]. The topological features of such systems are insensitive to local perturbations [\cite=Bravyi2010] [\cite=Bravyi2011a] [\cite=Michalakis2013], and they have quasiparticle excitations exhibiting anyonic statistics [\cite=Wilczek1990]. These systems can in general be used as quantum memories [\cite=Kitaev2003] [\cite=Dennis2002] or to perform universal topological quantum computation [\cite=Freedman2002] [\cite=Nayak2008].

Quantum error correction is vital to harnessing the computational power of topologically ordered systems. When coupled to a heat bath at any non-zero temperature, thermal fluctuations will create spurious anyons that diffuse and quickly corrupt the stored quantum information [\cite=Pastawski2010]. Thus, the passive protection provided by the mass gap at low temperature must be augmented by an active decoding procedure.

In order to efficiently classically simulate an error-correction protocol for a topologically ordered quantum memory, it is necessary to simulate the physical noise processes, the decoding algorithm, and the physical recovery operations. Decoding algorithms are typically designed to run efficiently on a classical computer, but there is generally no guarantee that the noise and recovery processes should be classically simulable. Because of this, almost all of the sizable research effort on active quantum error correction for topological systems has focused on the case of abelian anyons [\cite=Dennis2002] [\cite=Duclos-Cianci2010] [\cite=Duclos-Cianci2010a] [\cite=Wang2010] [\cite=Wang2010a] [\cite=Duclos-Cianci2013] [\cite=Bravyi2011] [\cite=Bombin2012] [\cite=Wootton2012] [\cite=Anwar2014] [\cite=Watson2014] [\cite=Hutter2014a] [\cite=Bravyi2014] [\cite=Wootton2015] [\cite=Fowler2015] [\cite=Andrist2015]. Systems of abelian anyons are well suited to studying quantum error correction because (at the RG fixed point) noise and recovery processes can be efficiently simulated numerically, allowing lattice simulations of decoding with over 1 million sites [\cite=Duclos-Cianci2010]. Standard algorithms are specifically tailored to exploit the abelian nature of these particles, particularly that abelian anyons cannot be used for quantum computation.

Recent investigations have begun to explore quantum error correction for nonabelian anyon models [\cite=Brell2013] [\cite=Wootton2013] [\cite=Hutter2014] [\cite=Wootton2015b]. Nonabelian anyon models are especially interesting because braiding and fusion of these anyons in general allows for the implementation of universal quantum computation. However, the initial studies of error-correction in nonabelian anyon systems have focused on specific models, such as the Ising anyons [\cite=Brell2013] and the so-called Φ-Λ model [\cite=Wootton2013] [\cite=Hutter2014] that, while nonabelian, are not universal for quantum computation. The general dynamics of these particular anyon models is known to be efficiently classically simulable, a fact that was exploited to enable efficient simulation of error correction in these systems. When considering more general anyon models, their ability to perform universal quantum computation would seem a significant barrier to their simulation on a classical computer. While simulation of general dynamics does indeed seem intractable, we argue that the kinds of processes that are typical of thermal noise are sufficiently structured to allow for their classical simulation in the regimes where we expect successful error correction to be possible. This insight allows us to simulate the noise and recovery processes for a quantum code based on a universal anyon model.

Concretely, we consider the simulation of quantum error correction in a two-dimensional lattice system with Fibonacci anyons, a class of nonabelian anyons that are universal for quantum computation [\cite=Freedman2002] [\cite=Nayak2008]. Fibonacci anyons are experimentally motivated as the expected excitations of the [formula] fractional quantum Hall states [\cite=Slingerland2001], and can be realized in several spin models [\cite=Levin2005] [\cite=Bonesteel2012] [\cite=Kapit2013] [\cite=Palumbo2014] and composite heterostructures [\cite=Mong2014].

We use a flexible phenomenological model of dynamics and thermal noise to describe a system with Fibonacci anyon excitations. Within this model, we apply existing general topological error-correction protocols, and simulate the successful preservation of quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom. Topological quantum computation protocols using nonabelian anyons typically implicitly assume the existence of an error-correction protocol to correct for diffusion or unwanted creation of anyons. Our results are the first explicit demonstration that such a scheme will be successful when applied to a universal topological quantum computer.

Topological model.

We consider a 2-dimensional system with point-like anyonic quasiparticle excitations, which exhibit exotic statistics under exchange. The worldlines of these exchanges form braids in (2+1)-dimensions which act unitarily on the Hilbert space of degrees of freedom known as the fusion space. To describe this space we define the topological observables of the system: these are total charge measurements within regions bounded by closed loops (Wilson loops). The possible results of such a charge measurement correspond to different anyon particle types in the model. These dynamics and observables obey algebraic rules given by a unitary modular tensor category [\cite=Wang2010b]. However, from the perspective of topological quantum field theory anyons are modeled as punctures in a surface [\cite=Pfeifer2014], and it is not the anyons themselves that braid, but the manifold in which the anyons reside that becomes deformed (twisted) by these braid moves. This is the perspective we adopt (see Fig. [\ref=f:braidloop]).

The defining difference between abelian and nonabelian anyon theories is that in an abelian theory particle content alone uniquely determines the outcome of total charge measurements. In contrast, outcomes for nonabelian charge measurements depend on the history of the particles as well as their type. That is, the fusion space is one-dimensional for abelian anyons, and generally larger for nonabelian anyons. In particular, we consider a system supporting (nonabelian) Fibonacci anyon excitations, denoted by τ. Two such anyons can have total charge that is either τ or [formula] (vacuum), or any superposition of these, and so the fusion space in this case is 2-dimensional. We can represent basis states for this space using diagrams of definite total charge for the Wilson loops, and arbitrary states as linear combinations of these diagrams:

[formula]

For n anyons of type τ, the dimension of the fusion space grows asymptotically as φn, where [formula] is the golden ratio.

Observables associated to non-intersecting loops commute, and so a basis for the space can be built from a maximal set of disjoint, nested loops. For three anyons, two possible ways of nesting loops are related via F-moves:

[formula]

Here we have shown particles with charges a, b, and c as well as total charge d. The lefthand side shows a state where the anyons with charge a and b are observed to have total charge i. The righthand side involves a superposition over total charge j of the anyons with charge b and c. The green line serves to linearly order the anyons, and track deformations in the underlying space, i.e. the history of braiding processes. It also denotes the direction along which F-moves occur. A clockwise braiding process, or half-twist, is effected by an R-move:

[formula]

These diagrams can be composed (glued) by regarding the outermost observable as a charge in another diagram. This operation distributes multiplicatively over superpositions, and it also respects the R and F-moves. Conversely, fusion of anyons corresponds to replacing the interior of a loop by a single charge.

For Fibonacci anyons, the non-trivial R and F moves are where the matrix is given in a basis labelled [formula]. For more details of the Fibonacci anyon theory, see e.g. Ref. [\cite=Nayak2008] and references therein.

In addition to the fusion space there is also a global degeneracy associated with the topology of the manifold on which the anyons reside. We consider systems with the topology of a torus, which for the Fibonacci anyons gives rise to a 2-fold degeneracy.

Noise and error-correction.

We consider encoding a qubit of quantum information in the global degeneracy associated with the topology of the manifold of our system. We endow this manifold with a finite set of L  ×  L Wilson loops arranged in a square lattice tiling Λ. These tiles will be the observables accessible to the error-correction procedure (decoder). We can use these observables to construct an idealized Hamiltonian for this system of the form [formula] with [formula] the projector to charge [formula] at tile t, i.e. the ground space of the model has vacuum total charge in each tile. Given the toroidal boundary conditions, this space contains the two-fold degenerate codespace.

Typical thermal noise processes in this kind of system are pair-creation, hopping, exchange etc. of anyons. Such a model was analyzed in detail for Ising anyons in Ref. [\cite=Brell2013]. It was seen that a simplified noise model consisting of pair-creation events only is sufficient to capture the qualitative features of an error-correction simulation, and so for convenience we will restrict to pair-creation noise processes in the numerical results presented in this study.

Pair-creation events acting within a single tile do not affect the corresponding observable, and so the only pair-creation events we need explicitly consider act between neighboring pairs of tiles. These are then each associated with an edge of the lattice Λ, chosen uniformly at random to model high-temperature, short timescale thermalizing dynamics. The simulation time, and thus the error-correction threshold, will be measured in terms of average number of noise processes per edge, as opposed to an iid noise probability per edge. The latter measure is not appropriate for error processes in nonabelian anyon models, but the two coincide in the limit of low error rates in those cases where they are comparable (see Ref. [\cite=Brell2013]).

We consider this treatment of anyon dynamics to be a phenomenological model in that it neglects any microscopic details of the system. This is consistent with the principles of topologically ordered systems and anyonic physics, where the key universal features describing the anyon model correspond to large length-scale physics, while the microscopic physics plays a less important (and non-universal) role. Additionally, while we model a continuum anyon theory, our analysis can be trivially reinterpreted to apply directly to lattice spin models or other systems where space is fundamentally discrete.

In order to perform a logical error on our code, a noise process must have support on a a homologically nontrivial region of the manifold. These correspond to processes in which anyonic charge is transported around a non-trivial loop before annihilating to vacuum.

Our error-correction algorithm is based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm [\cite=Hastie2009] [\cite=Wootton2015b], and follows a similar strategy to the hard-decision renormalization group decoder [\cite=Bravyi2011]. The decoder proceeds by measuring the charge on each tile of the lattice, producing a syndrome of occupied sites. Following this, it forms clusters of nearby occupied tiles and measures the total charge within each cluster. Clusters with trivial charge are discarded, and the rest are joined (agglomeratively [\cite=Hastie2009]) at linearly increasing length scales. This iterative process concludes when there is at most a single cluster remaining (see Fig. [\ref=f:decode]).

Note that unlike the case of abelian anyons, the decoder cannot determine the charge of each cluster given only the syndrome information (as in [\cite=Bravyi2011]), and so will query the system by measuring these charges. Our simulation proceeds in this way as a dialogue between decoder and system, terminating when either the decoder itself terminates or when it performs a homologically nontrivial operation, thereby altering the codespace (and failing to perform successful information recovery). Note that, as was found in Ref. [\cite=Brell2013], we expect that our qualitative results may be reproduced by most alternative families of decoders, although it may not be clear in all cases how to extend these decoders to the nonabelian setting. The advantage of using a clustering decoder is its simplicity and flexibility, and the fact that its clustering scheme is compatible with the structure in the noise processes that allows us to classically simulate them.

Classical simulability.

Although simulating pair creation, braiding, and fusion of Fibonacci anyons is equivalent in computational power to universal quantum computing (and thus unlikely to be classically tractable), noise processes and error-correction procedures have structure that we can exploit to efficiently simulate typical processes of interest. In particular, those processes in which we expect error-correction to succeed are also those that we expect to be able to efficiently simulate for the following heuristic reasons (we leave a more rigorous analysis of simulability for noise and error correction processes as an open problem).

Below the (bond) percolation threshold for (say) a 2D square lattice, we expect random sets of bonds to decompose into separate connected components of average size O( log (n)) and variance O(1) [\cite=Bazant2000]. Each noise process in our model is associated with a (randomly distributed) edge, and so disconnected components correspond to sets of anyons that could not have interacted at any point in their history. We are free to neglect the degrees of freedom associated with braiding between components because each component has trivial total charge. This allows us to simulate the braiding processes within each component separately. In other words: the quantum state in the fusion space of all anyons factorizes into a tensor product over components. Since each component has size only O( log (n)), we can typically simulate these dynamics efficiently because the resulting fusion space has dimension [formula]. There are random processes that violate this reasoning, but these are suppressed exponentially in the lattice size L [\cite=Grimmett1989].

However, random noise processes are not the only dynamics that we need to consider. We must also consider the effect of the error-correction routine itself. This acts iteratively to fuse anyons on increasing length scales. While this kind of fusion would typically merge components, forcing us to compute dynamics of larger and larger sets of anyons, large components are sparsely distributed (and thus unlikely to be merged), and in addition at each length scale the total number of anyons present is dramatically reduced by fusion, leading to a smaller number of anyons that must be simulated.

In the regime where the combined action of noise and error-correction does not percolate it is reasonable to expect that the simulation is efficient. However, with strong enough noise the state in the fusion space will no longer decompose at all and computing dynamics will become exponentially difficult in the system size. Despite this, we use heuristics that minimize braid moves, which helps to track the state beyond the sub-percolated regime. This enables simulation of error correction in the regime around the error-correction threshold for linear lattice sizes up to L = 128.

Simulation algorithm.

In order to track the state of the system we maintain a set of disjoint directed curves, one for each connected component with trivial total charge. Unlike previous work [\cite=Brell2013], this creates a dynamically generated basis for the fusion space that allows for tensor factorization of disjoint components. The application of a pair-creation noise process corresponds to the addition of an extra curve to the lattice, supporting two new anyons. Following the noise processes, our simulation must measure the total charge within each tile; the results of these measurements will form the error syndrome. This requires joining (arbitrarily) any curves that intersect that tile, and then performing R- and F-moves on the resulting curve so that all anyons within the tile have been localized within a contiguous region of the curve. An example of this procedure for a simple noise process is shown in Fig. [\ref=f:syndrome]. The details of the algorithm and data structures used for this procedure will be discussed elsewhere. Braiding processes that encircle a non-trivial loop of our (toric) manifold can also be treated in an analogous way, following e.g. [\cite=Pfeifer2012].

Following the results of the charge measurements, the decoder determines a recovery operation that involves fusion of subsets of anyons. These fusions can be simulated and their results calculated in the same way, and the output charge placed at an appropriate point in the lattice. This procedure is iterated until either the decoder terminates successfully, or the simulation itself declares failure.

Numerical results.

We plot the performance of the decoder as a function of noise strength for varying lattice sizes in Fig. [\ref=f:threshold]. The noise strength is parameterized by the Poisson process duration [formula], representing the expected number of errors per edge during the simulation. We find evidence of a decoding threshold below which decoding succeeds with asymptotic certainty as the system size increases at [formula].

We can guarantee that error-correction will succeed whenever the action of noise plus decoder does not percolate the anyons over the lattice, but it is possible that percolated events may still result in no error. The connection between the percolation threshold and the error-correction threshold is not well understood in general [\cite=Hastings2014], though it is clear that our threshold estimate will be a lower bound for the true threshold that may be found if all events (including those that have percolated) were simulated. However, calculations of homologically nontrivial operations for small lattice sizes suggest that almost all such processes will indeed result in a logical or leakage error. As such it is likely that neglecting the full simulation of these events does not significantly affect our observed threshold value.

Discussion.

We have demonstrated classical simulation of successful error correction in a universal anyon model. Though we have chosen several properties of our model and simulation in a convenient way for simplicity, Ref. [\cite=Brell2013] presents good evidence that it is unlikely these choices will affect our results qualitatively. In particular, although we have modeled our logical qubit as encoded in the global topological degrees of freedom of our system, we could have encoded it in the fusion space of several preferred anyons. This situation would be appropriate to model error-correction routines for topological quantum computation. Additionally, we expect our results to be stable to changes in details of the noise model and decoding algorithm, again following Ref. [\cite=Brell2013].

None of our techniques are restricted to simulation of Fibonacci anyon dynamics, and could equally well be used to simulate successful error-correction protocols in an arbitrary anyon code. As such, our methods could be used to demonstrate successful error-correction for an arbitrary anyonic topological quantum computer.

There are several interesting avenues for further research. Although it is not completely obvious how to do so, applying similar methods to more realistic models such as concrete microscopic spin models or models with non-topological features would give direct insight into practical error rates needed for topological quantum memories in nonabelian systems. It would also be interesting to find classical spin models whose phase diagram encodes the threshold for error correction in these systems [\cite=Dennis2002]. Finally, an important extension of this work would be to the simulation of fault-tolerant error-correction protocols for nonabelian anyon codes.
