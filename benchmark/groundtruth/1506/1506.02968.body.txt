A note on the Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem for proper actions

Introduction

A classical theorem of Lichnerowicz [\cite=L63] states that if an even dimensional closed smooth spin manifold admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature, then the index of the associated Dirac operator vanishes. In this note we prove an extension of this vanishing theorem to the case where a (possibly non-compact) spin manifold M admiting a proper cocompact action by a locally compact group G.

To be more precise, recall that for such an action, a so called G-invariant index has been defined by Mathai-Zhang in [\cite=MZ08]. Thus it is natural to ask whether this index vanishes if M carries a G-invariant Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. Such a result has indeed been proved by Liu in [\cite=L13] for the case of unimodular G. In this note we extend Liu's result to the case of general G.

We will recall the defnition of the Mathai-Zhang index [\cite=MZ08] and state the main result as Theorem [\ref=t2] in Section [\ref=s1]; and then prove Theorem [\ref=t2] in Section [\ref=s2].

A vanishing theorem for the Mathai-Zhang index

Let M be an even dimensional spin manifold. Let G be a locally compact group which acts on M properly and cocompactly, where by proper we mean that the map

[formula]

is proper (the pre-image of a compact subset is compact), while by cocompact we mean that the quotient M / G is compact. We also assume that G preserves the spin structure on M.

Given a G-invariant Riemannian metric gTM (cf. [\cite=MZ08]), we can construct canonically a G-equivariant Dirac operator D:Γ(S(TM))  →  Γ(S(TM)) (cf. [\cite=LM89] and [\cite=MZ08]), acting on the Hermitian spinor bundle [formula]. Let D±:Γ(S±(TM))  →  Γ(S∓(TM)) be the obvious restrictions.

Let [formula] be the standard L2-norm on Γ(S(TM)), let [formula] be a (fixed) G-invariant Sobolev 1-norm. Let [formula] be the completion of Γ(S(TM)) under[formula]. Let Γ(S(TM))G denote the space of G-invariant smooth sections of S(TM).

Recall that by the compactness of M / G, there exists a compact subset Y of M such that G(Y)  =  M (cf. [\cite=P89]). Let U, U' be two open subsets of M such that Y  ⊂  U and that the closures [formula] and [formula] are both compact in M, and that [formula]. Following [\cite=MZ08], let f∈C∞(M) be a nonnegative function such that f|U  =  1 and Supp(f)  ⊂  U'.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the completions of {fs:s∈Γ(S(TM))G} under [formula] and [formula] respectively. Let Pf denote the orthogonal projection from [formula] to [formula]. Clearly, PfD maps [formula] into [formula].

We recall a basic result from [\cite=MZ08].

The operator [formula] is a Fredholm operator.

It has been shown in [\cite=MZ08] that ind(PfD+) is independent of the choice of the cut-off function f, as well as the G-invariant metric involved. Following [\cite=MZ08], we denote ind(PfD+) by indG(D+).

The main result of this note can be stated as follows.

If there is a G-invariant metric gTM on TM such that its scalar curvature kTM is positive over M, then indG(D+) = 0.

If G is unimodular, then Theorem [\ref=t2] has been proved in [\cite=L13]. Our proof of Theorem [\ref=t2] combines the method in [\cite=L13] with a simple observation that in order to prove the vanishing of the index, one need not restrict to self-adjoint operators.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t2]

Following [\cite=MZ08], let [formula] be defined by that for any s∈Γ(S±(TM))G,

[formula]

Since one verifies easily that (cf. [\cite=MZ08])

[formula]

one sees that [formula] is a compact perturbation of PfD±. Thus, one has

[formula]

Now by ([\ref=2]), if [formula], then s∈ ker (D+). Thus, by the standard Lichnerowicz formula [\cite=L63], one has (cf. [\cite=GL83] and [\cite=L13])

[formula]

where Δ is the negative Laplace operator on M and [formula] is the canonical Hermitian connection on S+(TM) induced by gTM.

As has been observed in [\cite=L13], since the G-action on M is cocompact and |s| is clearly G-invariant, there exists x∈M such that

[formula]

By the standard maximum principle, one has at x that

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=7]) with ([\ref=6]), one sees that if kTM  >  0 over M, one has

[formula]

which implies that [formula] on M. Thus, one has [formula], and, consequently,

[formula]

On the other hand, for any s, s'∈Γ(S(TM)), one verifies that

[formula]

Let [formula] be defined by that for any s∈Γ(S±(TM))G,

[formula]

Clearly, f, + is a compact perturbation of PfD+. Thus one has

[formula]

Now by ([\ref=10]), one sees that the formal adjoint of f, + is [formula], while by proceeding as in ([\ref=6])-([\ref=8]), one finds that [formula]. Thus, one has

[formula]

From ([\ref=4]), ([\ref=9]), ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=13]), one gets [formula], which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=t2].
