On the Distribution of Products of Primes and Powers

Introduction

It is the purpose of this paper to understand further the distribution of numbers of the type pmk, where p is a prime and m and k are positive integers. The case k = 2 was considered by Cohen [\cite=cohen] in 1962, and it was therein established that

[formula]

where the sum is over primes p and positive integers m  ≥  1. As it is known that every number can be uniquely represented as the product of a square-free number and a square, it follows that the sum in the above equation counts each number pm2 precisely once. Moreover, every number has a unique representation as the product of a k-free number and a k-th power, and so we define

[formula]

Throughout this paper we call on standard results from analytic number theory. We will refer the reader to the appropriate section of Montgomery and Vaughan [\cite=mv] for further details.

Our first objective is to furnish the following theorem.

Let k  ≥  2 and let Ck(x) count those numbers not exceeding x that can be represented as the product of a prime and a k-th power. Then there exists a constant c > 0 such that

[formula]

Considering that the set of numbers of the form pmk includes the prime numbers, it is apparent that any improvement to the error term in Theorem [\ref=main1] will require a sharper form of the zero-free region. One can also reduce the error term in the above theorem by assuming the Riemann hypothesis to be true; this is the assertion that all non-trivial zeroes ρ of the Riemann zeta-function satisfy [formula].

Assume the Riemann hypothesis. Let k  ≥  2 and let Ck(x) count those numbers not exceeding x that can be represented as the product of a prime and a k-th power. Then we have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all k  ≥  3.

It seems curious that the case k = 2 should evade the error term which appears in the general case of Theorem [\ref=main2]. It would be interesting to see if somebody could prove the bound

[formula]

on the Riemann hypothesis.

From Theorem [\ref=main2], one can count numbers of the type pmk in the interval (x,x + h), where h = o(x). Clearly, we have that

[formula]

where A(2) = 2 and A(k) = 1 for k  ≥  3. From the estimate

[formula]

we have that the asymptotic formula

[formula]

holds for all k  ≥  2 provided that h(x) / (x1 / 2 log A(k) + 1x)  →    ∞  .

Using an explicit formula that relates the distribution of primes to the zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function, we can improve these estimates as demonstrated in the following theorem.

Assume the Riemann hypothesis. Then we have that the asymptotic formula

[formula]

holds for all k  ≥  2 provided that h(x) / (x1 / 2 log A(k)x)  →    ∞  , where A(2)  =  2 and A(k) = 1 for all k  ≥  3.

It is apparent that any improvement to Theorems [\ref=main2] and [\ref=main3] for the case where k  ≥  3 will require more information on the ordinates of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function. That is, these are best possible on the Riemann hypothesis. The author is unsure, however, as to whether one could improve the conditional estimates for k = 2, and so this can be considered as an open problem.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main1]

Let k  ≥  2. It is convenient to work with the von Mangoldt function and consider the weighted sum

[formula]

It should be remarked that C*k(x) will count some numbers (such as 36) more than once. We will attenuate this contribution later on.

Let k  ≥  2 and let

[formula]

Then there exists a constant c > 0 such that

[formula]

We divide this into two sums

[formula]

It is known (see Equation (6.28) of [\cite=mv] for example) that

[formula]

where

[formula]

for some constant c  >  0. Therefore, one may estimate the first sum by

[formula]

Clearly, the sum in the first error term can be bounded by comparison to the integral viz.

[formula]

For the second error term, we use that fact that m  ≤  x1 / 2k to get that

[formula]

Therefore, we have that

[formula]

It now remains to bound the second sum in ([\ref=twosums]). As m  >  x1 / 2k, it follows that the sum will only be over the prime powers n with n  ≤  x1 / 2. Therefore, we have that

[formula]

It follows by partial summation and the prime number theorem that

[formula]

This completes the proof of the lemma.

One should note that the value of c in Lemma [\ref=lemma1] will not necessarily be the same as that in ([\ref=pnterror]). This change arises from the fact that δ(x1 / 2)  ≪  δ(x).

We now prove Theorem [\ref=main1] directly. Clearly, we may write

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma1], it follows immediately that

[formula]

where δ(x) is as before for some c > 0. We need to estimate the rightmost sum in the above equation. Clearly, we have

[formula]

By the prime number theorem, we have

[formula]

Clearly, the sum in the above formula is O( log x) when k = 2, and O(1) for k  ≥  3. Therefore, we have that

[formula]

It follows by partial summation that

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2]

Assume the Riemann hypothesis. It follows (see Theorem 13.1 of [\cite=mv]) that

[formula]

Working similarly to before, we have that

[formula]

We can deal with the first sum as before to get

[formula]

Thus, we have that

[formula]

If k = 2, then the sum in the above equation is O( log x); otherwise, it is O(1). To complete the proof, one simply needs to remove the contribution of powers of primes from C*k(x) and apply partial summation as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main3]

We define the weighted sum

[formula]

and consider the well-known (see Equation (13.7) of [\cite=mv]) explicit formula

[formula]

where the sum is over the non-trivial zeroes ρ  =  β  +  iγ of the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s). Suppose that 2  ≤  Δ  ≤  h  ≤  x. We define a weight function wx,h,Δ(n) viz. This function assumes the shape of an isosceles trapezoid, supported on the interval (x - Δ,x  +  h  +  Δ), and constantly equal to 1 on the interval (x,x + h). One can use such a weight to study the distribution of primes in short intervals, with better error terms than a weight with a sharp cut-off. As such, we define the sum

[formula]

The following lemma connects this sum with the distribution of zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function.

Let 2  ≤  Δ  ≤  h  ≤  x. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

One can confirm the identity

[formula]

by expanding the sums on the left hand side. From here, it remains to apply the explicit formula ([\ref=explicit]).

Let m  ≥  1 and k  ≥  2. The sum SΔ / mk(x / mk,h / mk) counts the number of prime powers (with weight) in the interval ((x - Δ) / mk,(x + h + Δ) / mk). This is equal to the count of numbers prmk in the interval (x - Δ,x + h + Δ), though it is a small matter to later remove the contribution from higher prime powers as well as numbers outside of the interval (x,x + h). Therefore, we are interested in the sum

[formula]

A direct application of Lemma [\ref=dog] gives

[formula]

Estimating by comparison to the integral we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We now turn our attention to estimating the sum over the zeroes in ([\ref=bigformula]). Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we have that

[formula]

Clearly, we can write that

[formula]

where gk(h)  =   log h for k = 2 and gk(h)  =  1 for k  ≥  3. It thus remains to estimate the sum over the zeroes. We split this into three sums by

[formula]

and provide bounds in the following lemmas. Standard estimates for sums over the zeroes of ζ(s) can be found in [\cite=mv].

Assume the Riemann hypothesis and let 2  ≤  Δ  ≤  h  ≤  x. Then

[formula]

On the Riemann hypothesis, one has that

[formula]

Therefore we have the bound

[formula]

The result now follows from the fact that

[formula]

Assume the Riemann hypothesis and let 2  ≤  Δ  ≤  h  ≤  x. Then

[formula]

We write

[formula]

Estimating this trivially on the Riemann hypothesis one has

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

where N(T) counts the number of zeroes ρ = 1 / 2 + iγ of the Riemann zeta function with 0 < γ  <  T. The result now follows from the bound

[formula]

Assume the Riemann hypothesis and let 2  ≤  Δ  ≤  h  ≤  x. Then

[formula]

We start by writing

[formula]

We estimate this trivially on the Riemann hypothesis to get

[formula]

Therefore, we have that

[formula]

In consideration of the bound

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

Estimating the integral by

[formula]

completes the proof of the lemma.

We now return to the explicit formula. Combining the estimates from Lemmas [\ref=sumlemma1], [\ref=sumlemma2] and [\ref=sumlemma3] and the bounds ([\ref=smallbound1]) and ([\ref=smallbound2]) with the explicit formula ([\ref=bigformula]) gives us that

[formula]

We need to remove, from the above estimate, the contribution that arises from the case where n  =  pr and r  ≥  2. Consider the sum

[formula]

Clearly, this sum is bounded above by

[formula]

It is trivial to bound the inner sum by

[formula]

where we have used the fact that the number of r-th powers with r  ≥   in an interval (x,x + h) is [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

We also need to remove all numbers of the form pmk that are contained in the intervals (x - Δ,x) and (x + h,x + h  +  Δ). We have by the prime number theorem that

[formula]

Estimating the contribution from the interval (x + h,x + h  +  Δ) is similar. Therefore, we have that

[formula]

First, let k  ≥  3 and h  =  f(x)x1 / 2 log x where f(x) is a function which goes to infinity as x  →    ∞  . Choosing Δ  =  f(x)1 / 2x1 / 2 log x gives us that

[formula]

In the case where k = 2, we let h  =  f(x)x1 / 2 log 2x. Then, choosing Δ  =  f(x)1 / 2x1 / 2 log 2x, we get that

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=main3] now follows from ([\ref=number1]), ([\ref=number2]) and partial summation.
