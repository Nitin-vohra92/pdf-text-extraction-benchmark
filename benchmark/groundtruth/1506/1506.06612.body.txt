Littlewood-Paley decomposition of operator densities and application to a new proof of the Lieb-Thirring inequality

Introduction

Let [formula] and ψ a smooth function on [formula], supported in [formula], satisfying

[formula]

An example of such a function is given in [\cite=MusSch-book]. In particular, the function ψ can be chosen to be radial and non-negative. We define the Littlewood-Paley multiplier localizing on frequencies |ξ|  ~  2j by

[formula]

where F denotes the Fourier transform. The Littlewood-Paley theorem [\cite=MusSch-book] states that for any [formula], there exists C > 0 such that for any [formula] one has

[formula]

This harmonic analysis result has countless applications, from functional inequalities to nonlinear PDEs. It allows to obtain information about Lp-properties of a function u from the frequency-localized pieces Pju. For instance, it leads to a very short proof of the Sobolev embedding [formula] for p = 2d / (d - 2s), 0 < s < d / 2, as we recall in Section [\ref=sec:comparison]. It was also used, for instance, to prove Strichartz-type inequalities [\cite=KeeTao-98] [\cite=BurGerTzv-04]. We refer to [\cite=FraJawWei-book] for more general applications of Littlewood-Paley theory.

This note is devoted to a generalization of [\eqref=eq:LP] to densities of operators. When [formula] is a finite-rank operator on [formula], its density is defined as

[formula]

where γ(  ·  ,  ·  ) denotes the integral kernel of γ. We prove that for any [formula], there exists C > 0 such that for any finite-rank [formula] with [formula] we have

[formula]

When γ is a rank-one operator, this last inequality is equivalent to the usual Littlewood-Paley estimates [\eqref=eq:LP]. Indeed, if u with [formula] belongs to the range of γ, then ργ = |u|2.

The motivation to generalize the Littlewood-Paley decomposition to operator densities comes from many-body quantum mechanics. Indeed, a simple way to describe a system of N fermions in [formula] is via an orthogonal projection γ on [formula] of rank N. The quantity ργ then describes the spatial density of the system. Variational or time-dependent models depending on γ then typically include interactions between the particles via non-linear functionals of ργ, like in Hartree-Fock models [\cite=LieSim-77] [\cite=BovPraFan-74] [\cite=BovPraFan-76] [\cite=Chadam-76]. As a consequence, Lp-properties of ργ are often needed to control these interactions. When γ is a rank-one operator, these properties can be derived via Littlewood-Paley estimates (we typically think of Sobolev-type or Strichartz-type estimates). The estimate [\eqref=eq:LP-density] allows to treat the rank N case, and we illustrate this on the concrete example of the Lieb-Thirring inequality, which is a rank N generalization of the Sobolev inequality.

In Section [\ref=sec:LP] we prove the inequality [\eqref=eq:LP-density]. In Section [\ref=sec:LT] we apply it to give a new proof of the Lieb-Thirring inequality.

Littlewood-Paley for densities

In this section we prove the generalization of the Littlewood-Paley theorem to densities of operators. We will see that the proof is a simple adaptation of the proof of the usual Littlewood-Paley theorem. Thus, let us first recall briefly the proof of [\eqref=eq:LP]. It is usually done via Khinchine's inequality [\cite=MusSch-book], see the proof of Theorem 8.3 in [\cite=MusSch-book]: if one denotes by (rj) a sequence of independent random variables taking values in [formula] and satisfying [formula], one has

[formula]

for any set of coefficients [formula], for some C > 0, and for any [formula]. From this one deduces that

[formula]

The Fourier multiplier by the function [formula] is bounded from [formula] to [formula] for any [formula], with a bound independent of the realization of the (rj). Indeed, one has to notice that for any given [formula], there are only a finite number of non-zero terms in the sum [formula] (and this number only depends on ψ). The Mikhlin multiplier theorem [\cite=MusSch-book] shows the boundedness of the Fourier multiplier. We deduce from all this the inequality

[formula]

The reverse inequality is done by a duality argument where the condition [\eqref=eq:partition-unity] appears: we use the identity

[formula]

where [formula] is another sequence of Littlewood-Paley multipliers such that [formula] (which may be built from a [formula] which is identically 1 on the support of ψ). The fact that we cannot take [formula] is related to the deep fact that we cannot choose Pj to be a projection (that is, we cannot take [formula]); indeed such a Pj is not bounded on [formula] (except for d = 1 or p = 2) by Fefferman's famous result [\cite=Fefferman-71].

The main result of this section is the following lemma.

For any [formula], there exists C > 0 such that for any [formula], for any [formula] and any functions (uk)Nk = 1 in [formula] we have

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lem:LP-densities-sequences] implies the Littlewood-Paley decomposition [\eqref=eq:LP-density] for densities using the spectral decomposition of γ. We first need a version of Khinchine's inequality for tensor products, which is proved for instance in [\cite=Stein-book]. We however include a proof here for completeness.

Let [formula] a sequence of coefficients and (rj) a sequence of independent random variables such that [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

for all [formula], where the implicit constant is independent of (aj,k).

The reverse inequality also holds; we however do not need it here.

This inequality does not follow from the Khinchine inequality from abstract arguments because the sequence (rjrk) is not independent anymore: knowing r1r2 and r1r3 implies that we know r2r3 as well.

We only prove it for [formula], which is sufficient since [formula] for [formula]. We first apply Khinchine's inequality with respect to the random parameter associated to (rk):

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the expectation with respect to the random parameter associated to (rj). Since [formula], we may apply the reverse Minkowski inequality to infer that

[formula]

Using a second time Khinchine's inequality leads to

[formula]

From this tensorized Khinchine inequality, we deduce one side of the desired inequality.

Let [formula] a finite sequence of coefficients and (uk) a finite sequence in [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

for all [formula], where the implicit constant is independent of (λk), (uk).

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:khinchine-tensor],

[formula]

By the boundedness of the Fourier multiplier by [formula] on L2p, we have

[formula]

Applying again Khinchine's inequality, we have

[formula]

The other side of the inequality uses Lemma [\ref=lemma:weak-ineq].

Let [formula] a finite sequence of coefficients and (uk) a finite set of functions in [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

for all [formula], where the implicit constant is independent of (λk), (uk).

The right side of [\eqref=eq:LP-sequences-2nd] is well-defined due to Lemma [\ref=lemma:weak-ineq].

For any [formula], we have

[formula]

where the sequence [formula] was defined earlier. By Hölder's inequality,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:weak-ineq], using that p / (2p - 1) > 1 / 2, we have

[formula]

which leads to the desired result by choosing [formula].

Application: Lieb-Thirring inequalities

In this section, we explain how to use the Littlewood-Paley decomposition [\eqref=eq:LP-density] to provide a simple proof of the Lieb-Thirring inequality. We first compare the Littlewood-Paley decompositions [\eqref=eq:LP] and [\eqref=eq:LP-density], and argue why they cannot be used in the same way.

Comparison of the two Littlewood-Paley decompositions

The Lieb-Thirring inequality generalizes to densities of operators the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality

[formula]

This last inequality can be proved very easily using the usual Littlewood-Paley decomposition [\eqref=eq:LP]. Indeed, by Hölder's inequality we have

[formula]

meaning that the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality is immediate for frequency-localized functions. To get it for any function, we use the Littlewood-Paley decomposition [\eqref=eq:LP] and obtain

[formula]

We see here the power of the Littlewood-Paley decomposition: it allows to deduce functional inequalities from their version for frequency-localized functions. This has been used in several contexts, for instance concerning Strichartz inequalities [\cite=KeeTao-98] [\cite=BurGerTzv-04]. In particular, notice that we have used something much weaker than the Littlewood-Paley decomposition, namely the inequality

[formula]

which follows from [\eqref=eq:LP] by a triangle inequality. We now explain why the same strategy does not work in the context of the Lieb-Thirring inequality. This inequality reads

[formula]

for any finite-rank [formula]. To see that it is indeed a generalization of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, notice that it is equivalent to the inequality

[formula]

for any [formula], [formula] orthonormal in [formula], and any [formula]. The usual Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality thus corresponds to the particular case N = 1 of the Lieb-Thirring inequality. However, the Lieb-Thirring inequality does not follow from the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev and the triangle inequalities, they only imply that

[formula]

which is weaker than the Lieb-Thirring inequality, especially for large N. Let us notice that Frank, Lieb, and Seiringer have proved in [\cite=FraLieSei-10] an equivalence between the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev and (the dual version of) the Lieb-Thirring inequality.

Again, for frequency-localized γ, this inequality is elementary: the constraint [formula] implies that [formula] and hence [formula] for all [formula]. As a consequence,

[formula]

which is exactly the Lieb-Thirring inequality. Here, we used the fact that [formula]. Using the same idea as in the proof of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, we find that for any γ,

[formula]

which we cannot sum. Indeed, the inequality

[formula]

is of course wrong because d / (d + 2) < 1. We thus see the difference between the applications of the Littlewood-Paley decompositions for functions or for densities of operators: one cannot directly resum the frequency-localized inequalities in the context of operators. Of course, the reason behind it is the use of the rough triangle inequality [formula], which one should not do for operators. We now explain how to go beyond this difficulty.

Proof of the Lieb-Thirring inequality

Let us prove the Lieb-Thirring inequality using the Littlewood-Paley decomposition for densities. Hence, let [formula] an operator on [formula], which we may assume to be of finite rank. Since [formula] with [formula], we deduce that [formula]. We thus have

[formula]

Let [formula] a sequence of real numbers satisfying [formula] for all j. Then, we have the inequality

[formula]

Let us first notice that the lemma implies the Lieb-Thirring inequality: indeed, since [formula] we deduce that [formula] and hence [formula] for all [formula]. Hence, from the Lemma and [\eqref=eq:LT-first-ineq] we deduce that

[formula]

where in the last inequality we used the Littlewood-Paley theorem for densities. Let us now prove the lemma.

We split the following sum as

[formula]

We estimate the first sum using that [formula]:

[formula]

and the second sum is estimated in the following way:

[formula]

We thus find that for all J,

[formula]

Optimizing over J leads to the result.

Of course, the same strategy of proof allows to obtain more general inequalities of the type

[formula]

for all [formula], with [formula] and a >  - d / 2. In particular, the case [formula], a =  - 1, b = 1 is due to Rumin [\cite=Rumin-10] and was shown to be equivalent to the CLR inequality by Frank [\cite=Frank-14]. Our method is similar to the one used by Rumin, except that he uses a continuous decomposition

[formula]

instead of a dyadic decomposition coming from Littlewood-Paley. Rumin's method is actually far more powerful when dealing with these kind of inequalities, and was shown to work when replacing -  Δ by general [formula] by Frank [\cite=Frank-14]. The dyadic decomposition seems useless in these more general cases since it does not distinguish the high/low values of a. We expect that the Littlewood-Paley decomposition might be useful when one wants to exploit the "almost orthogonality" between the blocks (Pj): we have PjPk = 0, except for finite number of blocks, a phenomenon which does not appear in Rumin's decomposition. This orthogonality might be useful when dealing with higher Schatten spaces [formula] compared to the trace-class [formula] which appears for instance in the Lieb-Thirring inequality. We hope to find such applications in the future.
