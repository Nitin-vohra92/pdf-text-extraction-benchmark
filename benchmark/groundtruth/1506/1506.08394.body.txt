The Aharonov Casher Effect: The Case of [formula]

and Oded Kenneth

Aharonov Casher zero modes

In this section we will find explicitly the Aharonov Casher zero modes for a magnetic field which lives inside a thin annulus. First we write the Pauli equation for an electron in a plane. We take the magnetic field to be in the direction normal to the plane and the electron's spin to be along the field. Taking units where e = 1 we get:

[formula]

From now on, we will measure magnetic flux in units of [formula]. In our case, the entire magnetic flux lives on a infinitesimal thin circle of radius R:

[formula]

We will work in the Coulomb gauge:

[formula]

and in angular coordinates:

[formula]

[formula]

The Pauli equation (1) around at r = R gives the jump conditions between ψin and ψout. In a small enough neighborhood of r = R we can keep only second derivatives in r and the Stern-Gerlach term, while neglecting all the other terms with respect to them, to get: [formula]. Integrating ∂2r in a small neighborhood around r = R, we get the jump condition of ψ between the two domains, r < R and r > R :

[formula]

In order to find the wavefunction in the two domains, we will use the separation of variables: [formula] ([formula]), and get:.

[formula]

[formula]

From the restrictions of continuity, normalization and matching of the jump condition we must take D0 = F0 = 0 and [formula]. The jump condition gives us C0 = E0, which also give us continuity. Note that the existence of the Aharonov and Casher zero mode seems to be very sensitive to the jump condition, determined by the value of g. The remaining wavefunction is normalizable if, and only if, ψout is normalizable. Therefore we require:

[formula]

or [formula]. This gives us the [formula] different solutions predicted by Aharonov and Casher.

Bounded states with correction to the gyromagnetic factor

In this section we will find the wavefunctions and binding energies for the case of g > 2 (the case of g < 2 does not yield a normalizable wavefunctions). Using the same separation of variables as before: [formula], we get:

[formula]

[formula]

Looking at E < 0, we express [formula] as a linear combination of the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind [formula]:

[formula]

For normalization and continuity at 0, we must choose C2 = C3 = 0. From continuity at r = R we get:

[formula]

The binding energyE depends on the following parameters: n,Φ,g . Naturally, we are interested in the function E(g), for a value of g slightly above 2. It is technically simpler to examine [formula], which we get explicitly from jump condition (4):

[formula]

or:

[formula]

For m = 0, Expanding to first order in E we get:

[formula]

or:

[formula]

As an example, we can plot the electron s energy as function of the flux (noted as phi in the graph), for the gyromagnetic ratio of an isolated electron given by QED and no orbital angular momentum. We plot it for R = 1 / α2 (or [formula]) . Φ is shown in units of [formula] (or [formula] ) and E is of order of magnitude of mec2α5 and shown in eV.

We can see that the binding energy near [formula] is indeed of an order of magnitude less than the first order approximation, and that the slope is consistent with our approximation as well.

Another interesting relation is the binding energy as a function of the gyromagnetic ratio. For example, we plot it for a fixed [formula]:

We should also note two other interesting properties of those states: First, the critical flux for the emergence of a new bound state is somewhat lower with respect to the value given for g = 2. Second, the decay rate of the states far from the magnetic flux has a typical radius, in contrast with the g = 2 power law case.

Order of magnitude

In this section we will work in m.k.s units.

Estimation of the source of a unit magnetic flux:

A flux that is equal 2π in the units we used previously, is equal Φunit = 2πh / e in the m.k.s. units. One possible way to produce such a flux is to use a collection of magnetic dipoles originating from an electron's orbital angular momentum or spin. We will use the semi-classical Bohr model in order to estimate how many such atoms will be needed in order to get a one unit of quantum flux. Our model is a current loop, with a current that matches a single electron with the velocity ofαc, where α is the fine structure constant. This gives a current of [formula] in a loop of radius ab (the Bohr radius). By the Biot Savart law we get:

[formula]

For small radii around the current loop, the contribution to the flux from one side of the loop cancels the contribution from the other side. In a distance similar to the Bohr radius from the loop, there is no longer a similarity between the magnetic field in the two sides of the current loop so [formula]. This typical value lasts for an area of about πa2b which gives us:

[formula]

or:

[formula]

This means, we will need a magnetic tip with a cross section of order of magnitude of 1 / α2 dipoles in order to produce one unit of quantum flux at the end of the tip.

A second option to produce such a flux, is to pass a strong magnetic flux through a superconductor of the second kind, such that the penetrations of the magnetic flux will be dense enough for spotting the effect.

Estimation of the binding energy

As we saw in section 2, the bind energy is of the order of magnitude of:

[formula]

For an electron with the QED vacuum correction to the gyromagnetic factor and a magnetic field in a thin annulus of radius r, we get:

[formula]

In comparison to the hydrogen atom bind energy [formula], we get:

[formula]

Substituting a flux of a size of a few unit fluxes, according to the estimation from section (3.1), we get:

[formula]
