NEMATOGENIC LATTICE MODELS IN ONE OR TWO DIMENSIONS AND WITH LONG-RANGE INTERACTIONS

N. ANGELESCU

Abstract

Extending previous rigorous results, we prove existence of an ordering transition at finite temperature for a class of nematogenic lattice models, where spins are associated with a one- or two-dimensional lattice, and interact via long-range potentials.

Over the last twenty years, a number of rigorous results have been obtained [\cite=r01] [\cite=r02] [\cite=r03] [\cite=r04] [\cite=r05] [\cite=r06] [\cite=r07], concerning existence (or absence) of phase transitions at finite temperature in classical lattice spin models with isotropic, O(n) symmetric, interactions of ferromagnetic character (n  ≥  2, i.e. continuous spins); for one- or two-dimensional models, an ordering transition taking place at finite temperature can only be produced by appropriate long-range interactions [\cite=r01]. Reflection positivity and chessboard estimates have played a major role in the relevant demonstrations [\cite=r01].

In the present paper, we extend the named results from ferromagnetic interactions to even functions of the scalar product, thus making contact with lattice models for nematic liquid crystals.

We consider here a general classical lattice-gas (LG) model: Λd  =  Zd denotes the lattice, [formula] denotes the dimensionless coordinates of the k - th lattice site, and νk∈{0,1} its occupation number. Occupied lattice sites host n - component unit vectors [formula], where n = 2,3; the Hamiltonian thus reads

[formula]

here μ denotes the chemical potential, and the interaction possesses O(n) (or higher) symmetry. As a special case, the corresponding lattice spin (LS) model is defined by [formula], and here the chemical potential becomes irrelevant.

We assume the function F(R) to be non-negative at all distances, and to possess reflection positivity. Furthermore, let [formula] denote its lattice Fourier transform, and let the functional

[formula]

converge, (here BZ denotes the first Brillouin Zone); as for the function G(τ), we assume

[formula]

where PL are Legendre polynomials.

An interaction F(R) restricted at nearest neighbours (n - n) is reflection-positive; its associated functional Ψ(Fn - n) converges when d = 3 and diverges for d = 1,2, and the same dependence on dimensionality holds for any finite-ranged interaction [\cite=r08].

Long-range interactions of the form

[formula]

have been extensively studied in one and two dimensions; they possess reflection positivity, and their functional Ψ(F) converges for d  <  p  <  2d, and diverges for p  ≥  2d [\cite=r09].

For LS models and G(τ) = τ, the existence of an ordering transition at finite temperature has been proven rigorously, under the conditions stated above [\cite=r01]; the existence of a Berezhinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition was also proven rigorously for d = 2, ~ n = 2 and n - n interactions [\cite=r10]. For d = 1,2, inverse-power models defined by p  ≥  2d produce orientational disorder at all finite temperatures [\cite=r04] [\cite=r05] [\cite=r06] [\cite=r07]; available correlation inequalities [\cite=r11] [\cite=r12] [\cite=r13] [\cite=r14] [\cite=r15] entail the existence of a Berezhinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition for inverse-power interactions defined by d = 2, ~ n = 2, ~ p  ≥  4 [\cite=r16]; this is also likely to happen for d = 1, ~ n = 2,3 ~ ,p = 2, and for d = 2, ~ n = 3, ~ p = 4 [\cite=r11] [\cite=r17] [\cite=r18] [\cite=r19] [\cite=r20] [\cite=r21].

The existence of an ordering transition at sufficiently large chemical potential and finite temperature was proven rigorously for the LG model defined by d = 3, ~ n = 3, ~ G(τ) = P2(τ) and n - n interactions [\cite=raz]; its LS counterpart possesses an ordering transition at finite temperature.

Under the stated conditions on F(R), i.e. positivity, reflection positivity and convergence of Ψ(F), LG models defined by G(τ) = P2(τ) possess an ordering transition for sufficiently large values of μ and finite temperatures; their LS counterparts possess ordering transitions at finite temperatures.

The proof developed in Ref. [\cite=raz] for a three-dimensional model with n - n interactions carries through verbatim.

This entails existence of an ordering transition at finite temperature for one- and two-dimensional LS models with long-range interactions of the inverse-power form and d  <  p  <  2d.

These results were somehow implicit in various papers, but, to the best of our knowledge, nowhere explicitly stated.
