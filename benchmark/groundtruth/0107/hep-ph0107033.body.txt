Theoretical status of the lifetime predictions: (ΔΓ  /  Γ)Bs, τB+  /  τBd and τΛb  /  τBd

Phenomenology

Inclusive decays of B hadrons are expected to be theoretically very clean. Thefore they probe an ideal testing ground for our understanding of QCD in weak decays. Unfortunately there are some discrepancies between experiment and theory, not dramatic, which still have to be resolved. The determination of the semileptonic branching ratio still does not agree perfectly with the experimental number. Closely related to that problem is the so-called missing charm puzzle [\cite=missing] [\cite=neub]. If one tunes the input parameter to get a better agreement for nc one obtains with the same parameters worse values for Bsl. The present status of the missing charm puzzle can be found in [\cite=somecom]. Here clearly more work has to be done. The biggest problem in inclusive decays is still the lifetime of the Λb baryon. In the following we discuss the theoretical status of lifetime predictions of B hadrons in the standard model, in particular the decay rate difference (ΔΓ  /  Γ)Bs and the lifetime ratios τB+  /  τBd and τΛb  /  τBd .

The decay rate difference (ΔΓ  /  Γ)Bs

Now first experimental numbers for the width difference in the Bs system are available from LEP and CDF [\cite=workinggroup]: If one uses in the experimental analysis the theoretical motivated constraint 1 / Γs  =  τBd, one gets a central value of 16% with an error of ±  9%. This limits are already very close to the theoretical expectation [\cite=dgbsnlou]. ΔΓBs will be measured quite precisely in the near future at TeVatron [\cite=rob]. Several factors contribute to the big interest in ΔΓBs: a large value of the width difference opens up the possibility for novel studies of CP violation without the need for tagging [\cite=notagging]. Moreover, an experimental value of ΔΓBs would give information about the still unknown mass difference in the Bs system [\cite=dgdm] . Another interesting point is that new physics can only lead to a decrease of the width difference compared to the standard model value [\cite=grossman]. An experimental number which is considerably smaller than the theoretical lower bound, would thus be a hint for new physics that affects Bs-s mixing . Besides the need for a reliable theoretical prediction of ΔΓBs in order to fulfill the above physics program it is of conceptual interest to compare experiment and theory in order to test local quark-hadron duality, which is the underlying assumption in calculating heavy quark decay rates. One can show that duality holds exactly in the limit ΛQCD  ≪  mb  -  2mc  ≪  mb and Nc  →    ∞   [\cite=aleksan]. So far no deviation from duality has been conclusively demonstrated experimentally and theoretical models of duality violation in B decays tend to predict rather small effects [\cite=uraltsev].

The lifetime ratios: τB+  /  τBd and τΛb  /  τBd

The lifetime ratios of the B-hadrons are quite well known experimentally [\cite=lifetimeex]. BaBar and Belle expect to pin down the error of the first ratio to   ±  1% [\cite=lydia], BaBar has already a new result: 1.082  ±  0.028 [\cite=babar]. The lifetimes of the heavier Bs meson and the Λb hadron will be measured at CDF [\cite=rob]. Theoretically one expects all these ratios to be very close to unity, which is clearly not the case.

Theoretical status

In the framework of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) one can expand the decay rate in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass The leading term is described by the decay of a free quark and the first non-perturbative corrections arise at the second order in the expansion. Γ0 and Γ2 cancel out in the decay rate difference and in the lifetime ratios (except for Λb) and will therefore not be discussed in more detail. In the third order we get the so-called weak annihilation and pauli interference diagrams. Here the spectator quark is included for the first time. These diagrams give rise to different lifetimes for different B hadrons. Schematically one can write the Γi's as products of perturbatively calculable functions (Wilson coefficients) and matrix elements, which have to be determined by some non-perturbative methods like lattice QCD or sum rules.

The decay rate difference (ΔΓ  /  Γ)Bs

The decay rate difference can be written in the following way Γ(0)3 was calculated in [\cite=dgbslo] long time ago, the 1 / mb corrections were done in Γ(0)4 [\cite=bbd] and the NLO QCD calculation was presented in Γ(1)3 [\cite=dgbsnlo]. Both corrections gave a large reduction of the theoretical result. Meanwhile many unquenchend (Nf  =  2) lattice calculations of the non-perturbative constants (fBs, B and BS) which appear in Γ3 were done in [\cite=dglajap] [\cite=dglait] [\cite=dglaes]. The non-perturbative parameters which enter Γ4 are still unknown. In [\cite=bbd] the effect of these parameters was estimated in vacuum insertion approximation. The improvement in theory input motivated the update [\cite=dgbsnlou] of the result for ΔΓBs presented in [\cite=dgbsnlo]. We also clarified the origin of seemingly disagreeing recent evaluations of ΔΓBs: The authors of [\cite=dglait] [\cite=dglaes] were introducing a different normalization of ΔΓ  /  Γ in order to get rid of the dependence on f2Bs with the price of getting a strong dependence on the relatively unknown CKM-parameter |Vts / Vtd|. With that method one gets a central value for (ΔΓ  /  Γ)Bs of about 5%. We [\cite=dgbsnlo] [\cite=dgbsnlou] were normalizing the relative decay width difference to the semileptonic branching ratio, which should be theoretically very well understood . As lattice calculations are improving the dependence on f2Bs should be less important in future. With the values fBs  =  (230  ±  30) MeV, B(mb)  =  0.9  ±  0.1 and S  =  1.25  ±  0.1 we get as a final number which coincides with the most recent determination in [\cite=dglajap].

The lifetime ratios: τB+  /  τBd and τΛb  /  τBd

The lifetime ratio of two B mesons can be written in the following way Here the situation is very different. Only Γ(0)3 [\cite=lifetime] [\cite=neub] is known. NLO corrections, both in 1 / mb and αs still are missing. The non-perturbative matrix elements in Γ3 for the meson lifetime ratio were calculated with QCD sum rules [\cite=china] [\cite=defazio] and in quenched lattice QCD [\cite=dipierro]. For the Λb hadron only preliminary lattice studies are available [\cite=dipierro2]. In a recent review [\cite=flynn] the following theoretical numbers were given This result shows that the leading 1 / m3b corrections to τΛb are sizeable. From ΔΓBs we have learnt, that O(αs) and O(1 / mb) corrections to Γ(0)3 are important. So we still have to wait, till we can claim the discovery of new physics in the lifetime of the Λb baryon.

Prospects for improvement

For the lifetime ratios τB+  /  τBd and τΛb  /  τBd the next steps are clear: the calculation of the NLO QCD corrections (Γ(1)3) and the 1 / mb corrections (Γ(0)4) has to be finished. In the case of ΔΓBs all these corrections were quite sizeable (about 50% of the LO result!). For the Λb baryon a lattice determination of the non-perturbative matrix elements in Γ3 is still missing and for mesons one would like to have unquenched results, too. The next class of improvements (both for ΔΓ and the lifetime ratios) could consist of the determination of the non-perturbative matrix elements of the dimension 7 operators, which appear in Γ4. Morover one could do NLO QCD corrections to the 1 / mb corrections (Γ(1)4). As Γ(0)4 with vacuum insertion approximation for the bag parameters is very sizeable in the case of ΔΓBs [\cite=bbd], this effort could be really worth doing it. Of course, the errors for the decay constants and the bag parameter will become smaller in future lattice simulations. To clarify definitly the problem of getting different results for ΔΓ  /  Γ from different normalizations it would be very helpful to have precise numbers for Bsl from experiment. Finally, there are some more possibilities which seem to be quite unprobable, to be done in the near future: the NLO QCD corrections to Γ2 for Λb and the NNLO QCD corrections to Γ3, which would reduce the sizeable μ-dependence of Γ(1)3.
