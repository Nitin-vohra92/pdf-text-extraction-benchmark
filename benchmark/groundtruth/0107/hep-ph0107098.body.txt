Abstract

The current theory of strong interactions, the quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is a non-abelian gauge theory, based on the gauge group SU(3). Despite its formal similarity to QED there are significant differences. It was shown in 1973 already that the coupling constant g increases for large distances [\cite=Gross]. This gave hope for the possibility to explain quark and gluon confinement. Soon after, in 1975, non-trivial solutions of the Euclidian Yang Mills equations were found, nowadays called BPST instantons [\cite=BPST], which significantly influence the low energy structure of QCD. Many exact results are known for the 1-instanton vacuum [\cite=Raj] [\cite=Bro], whereby an interesting phenomenological result of it is the explicit breaking of the axial U(1) symmetry [\cite=tHo]. On the other hand, a one instanton approximation, similar to a tree approximation in perturbation theory, cannot describe boundstates or spontaneous symmetry breaking. The next step was the analysis of exact [\cite=Act] and approximate [\cite=CDG] multi-instanton solutions. There are two useful visualizations for these solutions. In one of these, instantons are interpreted as tunneling processes between different vacua. In the other interpretation, a solution describes an ensemble of extended (pseudo) particles in 4 dimensions.

In conventional perturbation theory one computes fluctuations around the trivial zero solution. The correct quantization process is to consider all classical solutions of the field equations and their fluctuations. In the path integral representation of QCD the partition function is, hence, dominated by an ensemble of extended particles (instantons) in 4 dimensions at temperature g2. In the simplest case the partition function describes a diluted ideal gas of independent instantons. Unfortunately, this assumption leads to an infinite instanton density caused by large instantons, which obviously contradicts the assumption of a diluted gas. This problem is known as the infrared problem. The problem is avoided by assuming a repulsive interaction [\cite=Ilg] which prevents the collapse. This is the model of a 4 dimensional liquid. Under certain circumstances the interaction can be replaced by an effective density. The Instanton Liquid Model in a narrow sense describes the QCD vacuum as a sum of independent instantons with radius ρ = (600)- 1 and effective density n = (200)4. The correctness of this model is still being intensively investigated. So far the model is essentially justified by its phenomenological success.

Numerical simulations of the Instanton Liquid Model allowed to determine a number of hadronic quantities, especially meson masses, baryon masses, hadron wave functions, and condensates [\cite=Shu] [\cite=ShV].

For computing the quark propagators and the meson correlators there are also analytical methods. The most important predictions are probably the breaking of the chiral symmetry (SBCS) in the axial triplet channel [\cite=Dya] and the absence of Goldstone bosons in the axial singlet channel.

The largest part of this thesis is devoted to extending the analytical methods and to evaluating the results in (semi)analytical form.

The meson correlators (also called polarization functions) will be computed in the Instanton Liquid Model in zeromode and 1 / Nc approximation, whereby dynamic quark loops will be taken into account. A spectral fit allows the computation of the masses of the σ, ρ, ω, a1 and f1 mesons in the chiral limit. A separate consideration also allows computation of the η' mass. The results coincide on a 10% level with the experimental values. Furthermore, determining the axial form factors of the proton, which are related to the proton spin (problem), will be attempted. A gauge invariant gluon mass for small momentum will also be computed.

The thesis ends with several predictions which do not rely on the Instanton Liquid Model. In the 1-instanton vacuum a gauge invariant quark propagator will be computed and compared to the regular and singular propagator. Rules for the choice of a suitable gauge, especially between regular or singular, will be developed. A finite relation between the quark condensate and the QCD scale Λ will be derived, whereby neither an infrared cutoff, nor a specific instanton model will be used.
