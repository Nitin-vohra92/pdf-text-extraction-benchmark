Growth of supermassive black holes and metallicity in quasars

Introduction

There is increasing evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centres of galaxies and quasars from current observations (see the reviews of [\cite=r84], [\cite=r98], Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001). The masses of SMBHs in galaxies strongly correlate with the masses of the corresponding bulges ([\cite=m98]), and even stronger with the dispersion velocity ([\cite=g00]). These facts reflect that the SMBHs grow with the bulges, albeit in a way which is yet unknown ([\cite=bs01]). The finding of the relation of Magorrian et al. (1998) may give us a clue to understand how SMBHs are formed in galaxies. Laor (1998) originally realized that there is a similar relation between the masses of SMBHs and the bulge luminosities of their host galaxies in 14 bright quasars (for active galactic nuclei see [\cite=w99], [\cite=fer01]). In Laor's sample, SMBH masses are measured by the velocity dispersion of the Hβ-emitting clouds, and the bulge luminosities are from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. These relations are connected to the growth of the SMBHs. However, how exactly a black hole grows, remains open.

Rees (1984) gave a map of all possible routes of SMBH formation. There are mainly two possible ways to form the central SMBH (see the routes of SMBH formation in Rees' diagram). The first is that SMBH forms directly from the primordial gas cloud, this is further investigated by Loeb (1993), Loeb& Rasio (1994). The physical reason is that star formation would be quenched when the infalling primordial gas reaches some critical central concentration ([\cite=lr94]). On the other hand, a dense star cluster may be formed via star formation. This is supported by the observations of nearby galaxies showing that there is a central star cluster with density of [formula] and a one dimensional velocity dispersion σ of typically ~  100  -  400 Km s- 1 ([\cite=l89]). The dense star cluster will inevitably form a SMBH, although the stars may evolve in somewhat different ways ([\cite=br78], [\cite=ds83], [\cite=qs87]).

It has been argued that three parameters, such as the mass and the spin of the black hole, and the accretion rate, may give a full description of a quasar (Blandford 1990). Recently, the metallicity, has received attention as the fourth parameter. It has become evident that quasars have very high metallicity, even at very high redshift (z > 4) ([\cite=hf99]). This means that there must have been very rapid and violent stellar evolution in the early stages of these quasars to produce the high metallicity ([\cite=hr93]). Metallicity, as a possible consequence of the formation and growth of SMBHs, may provide invaluable information of the history of quasars ([\cite=hf99]).

We are motivated by the chemical evolution of quasars based on measurements of metallicity (Hamann & Ferland 1992, 1993) to investigate this subject. The observation of emission line spectra of quasars can, in principle, provide the abundances in the broad line region (BLR), and would allow to deduce the details of the chemical evolution of the corresponding nucleus since the BLR is the innermost part of a quasar. In this Letter, we make an attempt to trace the metallicity of every route in Rees' diagram, and naturally connect the growth of the SMBH to the observed metallicity in quasars.

Observational metallicity in quasars

High metallicity is common among quasars. As an independent parameter describing quasars, metallicity may be used to trace the evolutionary history of quasars. The metallicity in quasars may open a new way to understand the growth of a SMBH. It has been suggested by Hamann & Ferland (1993) that NV / CIV or NV / HeII are very good indicators of the metallicity in quasars. They subsequently measured the metallicity in a large sample of quasars (Hamann & Ferland 1993, 1999). There appears unambiguous evidence for a correlation between metallicity and luminosity. Although we do not fit this correlation via regression, it is found that

[formula]

where α1  ≈  α2  ≈  0.5, and Lν is the specific luminosity at frequency ν. The reverberation technique provides a set of available data of quasars (Kaspi et al 2000), and shows a relationship between the mass of a black hole and its luminosity [formula] with β  ≈  0.5. From the above relations, we have

[formula]

This relation is mainly derived observationally, and the only assumption is that the BLR clouds are virialized in the potential of the SMBH. It is generally believed that this approximation works in quasars (Netzer 1990).

Metallicity in Rees' diagram

Rees (1984) lists the possible ways to form SMBHs in the universe. There are five possible routes. Route 1 (R1) is collapse and/or accretion directly from an original gas cloud. Route 2 (R2) is through post-Newtonian instability of a supermassive star. The supermassive star may be formed through two possible ways: 1) direct collapse from a gas cloud, 2) from collisional disruption of stars in a dense star formed from the gas cloud. Route 3 (R3) is the merger of a black hole binary formed from the supermassive star induced by bar-mode instability. Route 4 (R4) means that a SMBH is born through spectacular accretion in a cluster of neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes. Route 5 (R5) suggests that a SMBH is formed in a relativistic cluster of compact objects as in R4, but the relativistic instability or gravitational radiation will induce the formation of SMBH.

First we check route 1 (R1). This route was studied by Loeb & Rasio (1994). In such a scenario, the SMBH is formed directly due to a catastrophic collapse or it grows via gradual accretion. As we show below, a supermassive black hole may be formed via a single catastrophic collapse, but without ejection of metals since the gravitational binding energy is too strong to eject matter. Thus there will be no relation between metallicity and the mass of the black hole.

A supermassive star is first formed via two possible ways before collapsing to a SMBH. According to R2 a SMBH will be formed due to a post-Newtonian instability, R3 suggests that the SMBH is formed due to the merger of binary black holes. This process will lead to huge radiation of gravitational waves. It may be confirmed by the detection of gravitational radiation. The two routes (R2 and R3) employ the formation of a supermassive star. Here we will show that there is an upper limit for the mass of a SMBH created via R2.

The structure and evolution of the supermassive star is insufficiently understood. We assume that the supermassive star is composed of hydrogen. The gravitational binding energy of an object with mass M and radius R is Eg  ≈  GM2 / R, where G is the gravitational constant. Its total nuclear energy is En  =  εMc2 with ε being the conversion efficiency (ε = 0.007 for the burning of hydrogen to helium) and c is the speed of light. If we adopt the mass-radius relation [formula] for supermassive stars, where R0 = 9.0  ×  1011 cm and q = 0.47 (Collins 1989), we will have the upper limit of the mass of the supermassive object ejecting matter during the supernova explosion

[formula]

based on Eg  ≤  En, where [formula]. No mass ejection takes place during the formation of the black hole, albeit the collapse of the supermassive star for M  ≥  Mc. If a SMBH forms directly from the collapse of a primordial gas cloud, as the mass of SMBH is much higher than Mc, the detectable metallicity may be low because (1) no heavy elements produced in the collapse have been ejected, and (2) the dominance of radiation pressure in supermassive stars and compact supermassive disks would prevent fragmentation and star formation in these systems (Loeb 1993, Loeb & Rasio 1994). Although a strong wind may developed from the suface of supermassive star, the first reason (1) is still supported by the fact that the timescale of contraction of the supermassive star is much shorter than that of the mass loss through the wind on the surface of supermassive star. The contraction timescale of a supermassive star approximates to tcontr  ≈  3  ×  103R14(M / Mc)1 / 2 yr, where the typical dimension of the supermassive star R14 = R / 1014 cm ([\cite=f73]). This timescale is much shorter than the mass loss timescale [formula] yrs ([\cite=bond84]). Therefore there is no significant ejection of metals during the rapid evolution of the supermassive star.

It has been argued that the collision between a normal galaxy and a naked SMBH leads to the activity in a galaxy ([\cite=ft96]), but in this case there is no correlation between metallicity and the mass of SMBH. On the other hand, if a SMBH is formed in a dense star cluster via coalescence of stars or by a merger of stellar mass black holes, there is an approximate proportional relationship between the metallicity and the mass of the SMBH according to the dynamical and stellar evolution of the cluster. We will derive a crude approximation about this relation below.

Routes 4 and 5 (R4 and R5) suggest that the SMBH is formed in a dense star cluster. In R4 and R5, a cluster with stars heavier than 100[formula] is formed in advance. The high rate of supernova explosions leads to the formation of a cluster of neutron stars or steller-mass black holes. We assume that some of the ejected medium from the supernova explosions may form clouds in the broad line region. The two ways have a rough metallicity prediction as we show in the following. Following Duncan & Shapiro (1983), we assume that the cluster consists of N = 108N8 stars with a dispersion velocity v = 350v350(Kms -  1), this star cluster thus has a core with a radius Rc = 2.3N8v- 2350pc. Out of the radius Rc, the initial density has a power law profile [formula], here p is the index. This power law distribution may work further into the klio parsec scale bulge ([\cite=b01]). The two-body relaxation time is tr = 1.5  ×  1010N8Λ- 118v- 3350yr, where Λ18  =   ln (0.5N) / 18 and the initial masses of all stars are taken as one solar mass m. The total mass and the collision time scale of star cluster are mN and

[formula]

respectively. The black hole grows due to the coalescence of stars via collision and tidal capture of stars because the collisional interactions are inelastic. Detailed numerical simulations show that the growth of a black hole can be divided into two phases for an isothermal sphere of solar type stars in the absence of a black hole (Duncan & Shapiro 1983):

[formula]

where g0 is a constant related to N8 and v350, γ = (3 - 2p) / p  ≈  (0.9  ~  1.0) is the growth index in the later phase weakly depending on the cluster parameters. For example, g0  ≈  1.7, γ = 1 and tcoll = 2.0  ×  108yr for the case of N8 = 2.7, v350 = 2.9 (Duncan & Shapiro 1983). Here we neglect the small peak of [formula] around the critical time tcoll. After the collisional phase the growth of the black hole is mainly via the capture of stars from the cluster. It is thus expected that the main phase of metallicity enrichment is within the the time tcoll.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale approximates to [formula]yr, which represents the time scale to form a new star after coalescence (Quinlan & Shapiro 1987). Numerical results show that a massive star with about 50[formula] can grow within a time scale tcoal  ≈  106 yr due to colliding star coalescence if the dispersion velocity is less than its escape velocity (Colgate 1967). The maximum mass of a star due to coalescence via collision can be estimated from the fact that the coalescence process saturates when an ordinary [formula] star cannot be captured by the coalescencing star since this star can pass straight through them. Supposing the mass-radius relation to be [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula]. This mass limit is sensitive to the dispersion velocity. Considering some other physical rules, the coalescencing stars may grow up to 50 ~   100 solar mass ([\cite=br78]).

The time scale for star evolution approximates to [formula]yr for stars larger than [formula]. tKH is much shorter than the coalescence and evolution time scales of massive stars. It appears that the solar mass stars in the cluster may form many massive stars following the collisions and coalescence within the collision time scale. Once a massive star forms, the ejection of metal-rich ejecta will follow the post-main sequence nuclear burning, culminating most probably in a Type II supernova. The heavy [formula] element mass MZ yield in ejecta varies with the progenitor mass, but is expected to be in the range of 4  ~  40 [formula] ([\cite=ww86]). The rapid rotation of the progenitor can modify the metal yield by a modest amount as shown by the calculations ([\cite=bw83]). Although it remains uncertain, the most likely remnants of massive progenitors are stellar-mass black holes with ~   10 solar mass ([\cite=ww86]). Considering that the life time of a massive star is much shorter than the collisional time scale, the total mass of metals produced by supernova explosion is about [formula], then the metal abundance Z can be obtained by,

[formula]

Combining eqs (5) and (7) we obtain the following relation between the mass of a growing black hole and the metallicity as

[formula]

When t  ≥  tcoll, as the growth of the SMBH is dominated by the capture of stars, the above relationship will not hold. Detailed numerical calculations using a photoionization model show that the abundance Z is roughly proportional to the two ratios,

[formula]

and γ1  ≈  γ2  ≈  1 measured from the right panel in Figure 6 of Hamann & Ferland (1999). We would like to point out that this result is based on a series of broad emission line simulations that hold all other parameters fixed while the abundances are varied. We should keep this in mind. Thus the observable metallicity is given by

[formula]

This formula works within the collisional timescale tcoll which is determined by the cluster itself. We find that the theoretical prediction (10) is in good agreement with the observational relation (2). Therefore routes 4 and 5 (R4 and R5) may be the likely ways to form a SMBH from a primordial gas cloud.

Conclusions and discussions

In this paper we trace the metallicity along the routes in Rees' diagram in order to test the possible ways by which SMBHs form in quasars. The argument that a single collapse of a supermassive star forms a SMBH is not supported by the observed relation between metallicity and luminosity in quasars. The reason is that the mass is too high for the ejection of metals since its self-gravitation energy is larger than the energy of nuclear reaction. We derive a formula of growth of a black hole with metallicity, which is in good agreement with the observed relation between metallicity and luminosity. Thus observations seem to support the formation of SMBHs from a dense star cluster via coalescence and evolution of stars.

There is a modified route 1 (hereafter MR1) suggested by the referee. It states that if stars form during the collapse, they will enrich the gas with metals before the formation of the central SMBH. The gas that forms the SMBH might be processed by a generation of stars in the host galaxy before it gets funneled into the core to make the SMBH. Such a complex formation of SMBH depends on many processes, fragmentation of cloud during the collapse, the formation of multi-generations of stars. Let us speculate that a primordial gas cloud with mass of several [formula] is gravitationally fragmentated into several hundreds of massive stars with mass less than 4.5[formula]. These massive stars evolve undergoing hydrogen burning, then eject metals due to supernovae explosion, leaving a cluster with several hundreds of intermediate mass black holes ([formula]). What's the observational consequence of such a cluster? This interesting route will be explored in the future.

Recently, much attention has been given to the recurrent activity model of quasars ([\cite=hr93]), which seems to be supported by observations ([\cite=k01]). The mass growth of a SMBH in the first generation of quasars may be mainly due to R4 or R5. The masses of SMBHs in recurrent quasars may not increase significantly in the subsequent generations within the Eddington timescale [formula] years. This argument might be supported by the fact that the relation of the SMBH mass with the bulge mass in quasars ([\cite=l98]) is similar to the Magorrian et al. relation in galaxies. We note that the slope of the relation found by Laor (1998) is slightly different from that of the Magorrian et al. relation. If the differences are real, we might then deduce the evolution of SMBH accretion after the first generation. This is worthy of a future investigation.
