Introduction

Recently the branching ratios of B  →  φK decays have been measured by the BaBar [\cite=BABAR], BELLE [\cite=BELLE] and CLEO [\cite=CLEO] collaborations. There is an interesting problem related a penguin contribution to decay amplitudes [\cite=PEN]. A naive estimate of the loop diagram leads to P / T  ~  αs / (12π) log (m2t / m2c)  ~  O(0.01) where P is a penguin amplitude and T is a tree amplitude. But experimental data for Br(B  →  Kπ) and Br(B  →  ππ) leads to P / T  ~  O(0.1). Therefore, there must be a dynamical enhancement of the penguin amplitude. This problem is studied by Keum, Li and Sanda using perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach [\cite=KLS]. B  →  φK modes are important understanding penguin dynamics, because these modes are dominated by penguins. Here we report our study of B  →  φK decays using PQCD.

PQCD method for inclusive decays was developed by many authors over many years, and this formalism has been successful. Recently, PQCD has been applied to exclusive B meson decays, B  →  Kπ [\cite=KLS], ππ [\cite=LUY], πρ, πω [\cite=LY], KK [\cite=KK] and Kη(') [\cite=KoSa]. PQCD approach is based on the three scale factorization theorem [\cite=CL], [\cite=YL]. For example, B  →  K transition form factor can be written as

[formula]

where x1 and x2 are momentum fractions of partons, b1 and b2 are conjugate variables of parton transverse momenta k1T and k2T, and γφ is the anomalous dimension of mesons. The hard part H(t) can be calculated perturbatively. Ci(t) is the Wilson coefficient corresponding to the four-quark operator causing B  →  K transition. The scale t is given explicitly in terms of x1, x2, b1, b2 and MB, and it is of [formula]. Here Λ̄ = MB - mb, where MB and mb are B meson mass and b quark mass, respectively. It is important to note that in PQCD, the scale of the Wilson coefficient t can reach below MB / 2. In the factorization assumption [\cite=BSW], this scale is fixed at MB / 2. The Wilson coefficient for a penguin operator increases as the scale evolves down. This explains the enhancement of the penguin amplitude in PQCD compared to the amplitude obtained by the factorization assumption.

In this method, we can calculate not only factorizable amplitudes but also nonfactorizable and annihilation amplitudes. In case of B  →  φK decays, the factorizable amplitudes which can be written in terms of form factors FBK and FφK are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fact](a)-(d). The nonfactorizable amplitudes are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:nonfact](a)-(d). Ellipses denote meson wave functions in these figures. For illustration purposes, we show the hard part of the nonfactorizable diagram as the dashed box in Fig. [\ref=fig:nonfact](a). The parameters in meson wave functions are calculated from the light-cone QCD sum rules, and the theoretical uncertainty of the parameters is about 30%. The hard part depends on the particular processes, but it is calculable. The wave functions contain non-perturbative dynamics and are not calculable, but once it is known, it can be used for other decay processes.

In this paper, we calculate branching ratios for B  →  φK modes using PQCD approach. The detail is discussed in Ref. [\cite=phik]. We predict the branching ratios for B  →  φK decays, and our predictions agree with the current experimental data and are larger than the values obtained from the naive factorization assumption (FA) and the QCD-improved factorization (QCDF) [\cite=QIF1], [\cite=QIF2].

B  →  φK Amplitudes

We consider B meson to be at rest. In the light-cone coordinate, the B meson momentum P1, the K meson momentum P2 and the φ meson momentum P3 are taken to be

[formula]

where rφ  =  Mφ / MB, and the K meson mass is neglected. The momentum of the spectator quark in the B meson is written as k1. Since the hard part is independent of k+1, the δ(k+1) function appears after integrating over its conjugate spacial variable. Therefore, k1 has only the minus component k-1 and small transverse components [formula]. k-1 is given as k-1 = x1P-1, where x1 is a momentum fraction. The quarks in the K meson have plus components x2P+2 and (1 - x2)P+2, and the small transverse components [formula] and [formula], respectively. The quarks in the φ meson have the minus components x3P-3 and (1 - x3)P-3, and the small transverse components [formula] and [formula], respectively. The φ meson longitudinal polarization vector εφ and two transverse polarization vector εφT are given by [formula] and [formula].

The B meson wave function for incoming state and the K and φ meson wave functions for outgoing state with up to twist-3 terms are written as

[formula]

where i and j is color indices, and α and β are Dirac indices. m0K is related to the chiral symmetry breaking scale, m0K  =  M2K / (md + ms). v and n are defined as vμ  =  Pμ2 / P+2 and [formula]. We neglect the terms which are proportional to the transverse polarization vector εTφ, because these terms drop out from our calculation kinematically. The explicit form of these wave functions will be shown in Sec. [\ref=sec:num].

Widths of B  →  φK decays can be expressed as

[formula]

The decay amplitudes, A, and [formula], corresponding to B0  →  φK0, and 0  →  φq0, respectively, are written as

[formula]

where Fe is the amplitude for factorizable diagrams which are considered in FA. Fa and M are the annihilation factorizable and the nonfactorizable diagrams which are neglected in FA. The indices, e, and a, denote the tree topology, and annihilation topology, respectively. The index P denotes the contribution from diagrams with a penguin operator. The decay amplitudes, A+, and A-, corresponding to B+  →  φK+, and B-  →  φK-, respectively, are written as

[formula]

where the index T denotes tree contributions. Since the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements for the tree amplitudes are much smaller than for the penguin amplitudes, the tree contributions are very small.

The factorizable diagrams are given as Fig. [\ref=fig:fact]. The factorizable penguin amplitude, FPe, which comes from Fig. [\ref=fig:fact](a) and Fig. [\ref=fig:fact](b) is written as

[formula]

where Nt{x(1 - x)}c is the factor for the threshold resummation [\cite=TR]. We use Nt = 1.775 and c = 0.3 [\cite=KuLS]. The evolution factors are defined by Ee(t) = αs(t)ae(t) exp [ -  SB(t)  -  SK(t)] where exp [ -  Si(t)] is the factor for the kT resummation [\cite=CS], [\cite=BS]. The explicit forms of the factor Si(t) are given, for example, in Ref. [\cite=KLS]. The hard scales t(1)e and t(2)e, which are the scales in hard process, are given by [formula] and [formula]. The Wilson coefficient is given by

[formula]

The hard function, which is the Fourier transformation of the virtual quark propagator and the hard gluon propagator, is given by

[formula]

The factorizable annihilation diagrams shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fact](c) and Fig. [\ref=fig:fact](d), and the nonfactorizable diagrams shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:nonfact](a)-(d) can be also calculated in the same way as FPe [\cite=phik].

Numerical Results

We use the model of the B meson wave function written as

[formula]

where ωB = 0.40 GeV [\cite=BW]. NB is determined by normalization condition given by

[formula]

The K meson wave functions are given as

[formula]

where ρK = (md + ms) / MK [\cite=PB1], [\cite=PB2]. The parameters of these wave functions are given as a1 = 0.17,  a2 = 0.20,  η3 = 0.015 and ω3 =  - 3.0 where the renormalization scale is 1 GeV.

The φ meson wave functions are given as

[formula]

where ζT3 = 0.024 and δ+ = 0.46 [\cite=PB3]. We have found that the final results are insensitive to the values chosen for ζT3 and δ+.

We use the Wolfenstein parameters for the CKM matrix elements [formula] [\cite=PDG], and choose the angle φ3  =  π / 2 [\cite=KLS]. We have found that the final results are quite insensitive to the values of φ3. For the values of meson masses, we use MB  =  5.28  GeV, MK  =  0.49  GeV and Mφ = 1.02  GeV. In addition, for the values of meson decay constants, we use fB  =  190  MeV, fK  =  160  MeV, fφ  =  237  MeV and fTφ  =  215  MeV. The B meson life times are given as τB0 = 1.55  ×  10- 12   sec and τB± = 1.65  ×  10- 12   sec. And we use Λ(4)QCD = 0.250  GeV and m0K = 1.70  GeV [\cite=KLS].

We show the numerical results of each amplitude for B0  →  φK0 and B±  →  φK± decays in Tab. [\ref=table1]. The factorizable penguin amplitude FPe gives a dominant contribution to B  →  φK decays. The factorizable annihilation penguin amplitude FPa generates a large strong phase. In B±  →  φK± modes, there are contributions from fBFTa and MTa. These tree amplitudes contribute only a few percent to the whole amplitude, since the CKM matrix elements related to the tree amplitudes are very small. In order to isolate the trivial uncertainty from fB, fK and fφ, we express our prediction for B  →  φK as

[formula]

We found that our result is insensitive to fTφ / fφ. For example, 10% variation of fTφ / fφ leads to less than 1% variation in our final result. The current experimental values are summarized in Tab. [\ref=table2]. The values which are predicted in PQCD are consistent with the current experimental data. However, our branching ratios have the theoretical error from the O(α2s) corrections, the higher twist corrections, and the error of input parameters. Large uncertainties come from the meson decay constants, the shape parameter ωB, and m0K. These parameters are fixed from the other modes (B  →  Kπ,  Dπ, etc.). We try to vary ωB from 0.36 GeV to 0.44 GeV, then we obtain Br(B±  →  φK±)  =  (7.54  ~  13.9)  ×  10- 6. Next, we set ωB = 0.40 and try to vary m0K from 1.40 GeV to 1.80 GeV, then we obtain Br(B±  →  φK±)  =  (6.65  ~  11.4)  ×  10- 6.

Now, we consider the ratio of the branching ratio for the B0  →  φK0 decay to the one for the B+  →  φK+ decay. The theoretical uncertainties from various parameters are small, since the parameters in the numerator cancel out those in the denominator. The difference between the two branching ratios come in principle from B meson life times, tree and electroweak penguin contributions in annihilation amplitudes. We found that the tree and electroweak penguin amplitudes in the annihilation diagrams are negligible. Tree amplitudes are suppressed by two factors. First, they are annihilation processes which are suppressed by helicity. Second, they are multiplied by small CKM matrix elements. We predict that this ratio is

[formula]

where the theoretical uncertainties from m0K and ωB are less than 1%. The ratio is essentially given by the life time difference. The experimental value of this ratio from BELLE [\cite=BELLE] is Br(B0  →  φK0) / Br(B+  →  φK+)  =  0.82+ 0.39- 0.32  ±  0.10.

In FA, the branching ratio is very sensitive to the effective number of colors Neffc. If we set Neffc=3, then the branching ratio is about 4.5  ×  10- 6 where the scale of the Wilson coefficient is taken to MB / 2 and FBK is 0.38 from the BSW model. In QCDF, branching ratios for B  →  φK decays are predicted as Br(B0  →  φK0)  =  (4.0+ 2.9- 1.4)  ×  10- 6 and Br(B-  →  φK-)  =  (4.3+ 3.0- 1.4)  ×  10- 6 including the annihilation diagram [\cite=QIF2]. Our predicted values are larger than these results. This is due to the enhancement of the Wilson coefficient for the penguin amplitude as explained in Sec. [\ref=sec:intro]. In PQCD approach, the scale of the Wilson coefficients, which is equal to the hard scale t, can reach lower values than MB / 2.

Summary

In this paper, we calculate B0  →  φK0 and B±  →  φK± decays in PQCD approach. Our predicted branching ratios agree with the current experimental data and are larger than the values obtained by FA and QCDF. Because the Wilson coefficients for penguin operators are enhanced dynamically in PQCD.

Note added:

After this work has been completed, we become aware of a similar calculation by Chen, Keum and Li [\cite=CKL]. Our results are in agreement.
