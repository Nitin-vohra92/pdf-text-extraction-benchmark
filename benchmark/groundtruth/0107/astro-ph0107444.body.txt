X-ray source population of the Galactic center region obtained with ASCA

The ASCA Galactic Center Survey

Due to the crowdedness of and heavy absorption to the Galactic center (hereafter, GC) region, the information, including the distances, on the X-ray sources there has been limited. If the spectra of the sources are examined, the obtained column density can be a good indicator of the distance.

For the ASCA GC survey data, we have made point-source search, spectral fitting for the detected sources, and identification, combining past references (Sakano et al. 2001). We hence could determine their spectral parameters, including the column density, for the bright sources (Sakano et al. 2001).

We here investigate what determines the column density to bright X-ray sources, and then estimate the distribution of cold interstellar matter in the GC region. We study and discuss the statistical property of the X-ray sources in the GC region. We assume the distance to the GC to be 8.5 kpc.

Column Densities

we thus estimate the scale length of the cold ISM density in the GC region for the perpendicular direction from the plane to be 20 pc, whereas the total cold ISM mass is calculated to be 6  Ã—  107 M[formula], assuming the solar abundance and a simple radially-symmetrical shape for the cold ISM distribution.

X-ray source population

Our results strongly confirmed the population of late-type objects in the GC region (Table 1). Note that we classified pulsars to high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and bursters to low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) because the companion stars are not identified for most of the sources. Since the companions of HMXBs are considered to have been born ~  107 years ago, the number of HMXBs or the ratio of HMXBs to LMXBs is a good indicator for the past star formation activity in the observed region; our result suggests rather quiet star formation activity ~  107 years ago in the GC region.
