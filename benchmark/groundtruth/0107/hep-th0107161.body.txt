The critical N = 2 string, or a string theory exhibiting two local supersymmetries on the world-sheet, provides a conventional framework for a stringy description of self-dual gauge theory and self-dual gravity in two spatial and two temporal dimensions (or a four-dimensional Euclidean space). Apart from a number of salient features characterising the model (good reviews can be found in [\cite=markus] [\cite=lechtenfeld]) like the presence of a finite number of physical states in the quantum spectrum, the spectral flow phenomenon etc., there is a fundamental drawback intrinsic to the theory. It lacks manifest Lorentz covariance. Some time ago it has been realized [\cite=siegel] [\cite=berkvafa] [\cite=bvw] that there exists an alternative description for the model based on a small N = 4 superconformal algebra (SCA). According to the N = 4 topological prescription, the N = 2 SCA is to be extended by a set of new currents which, however, prove to be functionally dependent on the former [\cite=siegel] [\cite=bg] and do not imply any new information. The crucial point regarding the new setting is that an external global automorphism group of a small N = 4 SCA turns out to be larger than that of the N = 2 SCA and includes the full Lorentz group SO(2,2) = SU(1,1)  ×  SU(1,1)'. It is interesting to mention that, to a large extent, the situation resembles what happens for the conventional N = 1, d = 10 Green-Schwarz superstring, where extracting an irreducible subset from the original fermionic constrains is known to be in a conflict with the manifest Lorentz covariance. Notice further that applying the N = 4 topological formalism, as originally formulated in Refs. [\cite=siegel] [\cite=berkvafa], one works directly in the superconformal gauge and a gauge invariant action necessary for a conventional path integral quantization is missing. In view of the last obstacle, a set of reasonable prescriptions to calculate scattering amplitudes has been proposed in Ref. [\cite=berkvafa] and shown to reproduce the N = 2 quantum string scattering. However, appealing to the topological twist, the method of Ref. [\cite=berkvafa] does not treat all the currents on equal footing and violates the manifest Lorentz covariance. Although the N = 4 topological prescription does suggest a number of impressive simplifications in the explicit evaluation of scattering amplitudes the main advantage offered by the framework, namely the manifest Lorentz covariance, seems to be unexploited.

Recently, we constructed an action functional for the N = 4 topological string [\cite=bg]. The key observation was that, apart from the ordinary U(1,1) global group which is a symmetry of the N = 2 string and a trivial automorphism of the N = 2 SCA, on the space of the fields at hand one can realize an extra U(1,1) group (sticking to the terminology of Ref. [\cite=bvw] we call it U(1,1)outer ) which automatically generates the currents of a small N = 4 SCA when applied to those of the N = 2 SCA. Having recognised that, the construction of the action amounts to the installation of the extra invariance in the N = 2 string action by making use of the ordinary Noether procedure. Based on the Hamiltonian considerations we argued how many local symmetries the N = 4 topological string action must exhibit but failed to give the explicit form. It is the purpose of this paper to display all local symmetries of the model thus completing the Lagrangian formulation. Given the latter, the standard path integral quantization becomes available suggesting an intriguing possibility to restore the manifest Lorentz covariance in the N = 2 string scattering amplitudes. The last point provides the main motivation for the present work.

Since the N = 4 topological formalism relies essentially upon the conventional N = 2 string we first briefly outline the structure of the latter. As is typical of string theories exhibiting an N-extended local supersymmetry on the world-sheet, the N = 2 model describes a coupling of an N = 2 world-sheet (on-shell) supergravity to matter multiplet. The latter involves a complex scalar zn and a complex Dirac spinor ψnA, with the target index n taking values n = 0,1 in the critical dimension, while the former is composed of a graviton [formula] (n stands for a flat index), a complex gravitino χAα, A = 1,2, and a real vector field [formula]. The action functional reads [\cite=brink] (our d = 2 spinor notations are those of Ref. [\cite=bg])

[formula]

where *   stands for the complex conjugation. Notice is that the model lacks manifest Lorentz covariance. This is due to the complex geometry intrinsic to the formalism which fails to be compatible with the full target-space Lorentz group Spin(2,2) = SU(1,1)  ×  SU(1,1)' and chooses a specific subgroup U(1,1)≃U(1)  ×  SU(1,1) as an ultimate global symmetry of the theory.

Turning to local symmetries, with N growing a world-sheet supergravity intrinsic to a theory entails a richer family of local transformations. For the case at hand, apart from the ordinary diffeomorphisms, local Lorentz transformations and Weyl symmetry, the model reveals two new bosonic symmetries with real parameters a and b

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], the super Weyl transformation with a complex fermionic parameter νA

[formula]

and an N = 2 local world-sheet supersymmetry (the parameter is complex)

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the conventional world-sheet covariant derivative [formula]. A straightforward verification of the world-sheet supersymmetry ([\ref=locsusy]) turns out to be pretty tedious. The hint is to gather the terms with a given power of ∂z (or [formula], or both) and show that they do cancel each other. The Fiertz identities involving the world-sheet spinors (recall γnγm =  - ηnm  -  εnmγ3, εnmγm  =  γ3γn and εmnεkl =  - ηmkηnl  +  ηmlηnk)

[formula]

prove to be crucial here. Altogether the transformations given above allow one to gauge away the fields which furnish the world-sheet supergravity multiplet, while the variation of the action with respect to the fields made prior to the gauge fixing proves to yield precisely the N = 2 superconformal currents as the essential constrains on the system.

Turning to the N = 4 topological formalism, we first introduce the notation

[formula]

where εA stands for the Grassmann parity of a field A and εmn is the Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor, ε01 =  - 1. Then the conventional U(1,1) transformations act on the elementary field combinations in the following way (AB = AnηnmBm)

[formula]

while the action of the U(1,1)outer group we mentioned above reads (for more details see Ref. [\cite=bg])

[formula]

The action functional which exhibits both U(1,1) and U(1,1)outer global invariance requires the introduction of some extra gauge fields on the world-sheet of the string [\cite=bg]. These turn out to complement an N = 2, d = 2 supergravity multiplet to that of an N = 4, d = 2 supergravity and include two real vector fields [formula] and [formula] and a complex spinor μAα (see for example Ref. [\cite=gates]). The new fields transform nontrivially under the action of U(1,1)outer group [\cite=bg]

[formula]

the bosons furnishing a triplet representation with respect to SU(1,1)outer subgroup while the fermions forming the doublet representation. Conformed to the conventional spinor notation the action functional of Ref. [\cite=bg] reads

[formula]

Here C stands for the charge conjugation matrix which in the representation chosen just coincides with γ0 (see also the Appendix of Ref. [\cite=bg]).

We now turn to discuss local symmetries of the full action. The first important point to check is that adding the new fields to the original N = 2 theory one does not spoil the symmetries ([\ref=a])-([\ref=locsusy]). For the bosonic a- and b-transformations this turns out to be the case provided the following transformation laws for the newly introduced fields

[formula]

and

[formula]

For the super Weyl transformations ([\ref=nu]) to hold in the extended N = 4 action the complex gauge field [formula] is to be transformed according to the rule

[formula]

Finally, the N = 2 local supersymmetry requires

[formula]

for the extra fields and moreover, the variations of ψn and [formula] are to include the new contributions

[formula]

in order to provide a symmetry of the extended formalism. Notice that the last two lines involve explicitly the Levi-Civita tensor, thus providing a nontrivial interplay between AB- and [formula]-terms.

As we have mentioned earlier, on the world-sheet the theory is described by an N = 4, d = 2 supergravity multiplet. The latter proves to entail a richer family of local symmetries as compared to those provided by an N = 2, d = 2 supergravity multiplet underlying the conventional N = 2 string. A complete Hamiltonian analysis for the model at hand has been performed in Ref [\cite=bg]. The conclusion based on the counting of unspecified Lagrange multipliers corresponding to primary first class constraints in the question was that the theory must exhibit two more bosonic symmetries with complex parameters, these corresponding to the (complex) gauge field [formula], and two more fermionic symmetries with complex spinor parameters, these coming along with μAα and being the partners for the super Weyl symmetry and the local supersymmetry. Making use of the identities ([\ref=fiertz]) one indeed finds two new bosonic transformations which resemble very much the a- and b-symmetries (in contrast to the transformations ([\ref=a]) and  ([\ref=b]) the parameters c and f are complex)

[formula]

and

[formula]

In its turn the super Weyl transformation prompts the form of a partner realized on the extra fields (the parameter λA is a complex d = 2 spinor)

[formula]

Finally, with the extensive use of the identities ([\ref=fiertz]) one can verify the invariance of the action under a novel fermionic symmetry

[formula]

this complementing the transformations ([\ref=locsusy]) to the full N = 4 local supersymmetry. It should be stressed that a straightforward verification of the extra fermionic symmetry turns out to be pretty tedious. Getting rid of γ-matrices like we did in the previous work [\cite=bg] both in the action and in the transformation laws simplifies the calculation considerably since does not appeal to any Fiertz identities. The form of the transformations, however, look more compact in the conventional spinor notations to which we stick here.

To summarise, in this paper we gave the action (conformed to the conventional spinor notation) and established all local symmetries for the N = 4 topological string. A natural next step which, to a great extent, motivated the present investigation, is to construct scattering amplitudes proceeding from the conventional path integral quantization. The reducibility of the current forming an N = 4 SCA will presumably cause certain complications of the conventional method. However, since all the currents are scalars one can expect to reveal a finite stage of reducibility for the system and hence finitely many ghosts involved.
