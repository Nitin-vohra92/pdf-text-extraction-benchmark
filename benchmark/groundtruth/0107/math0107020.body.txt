Markov subshifts and partial representation of [formula]

Introduction

Considering a Markov subshift on an alphabet [formula], R. Exel proved in [formula] that n partial isometries on a Hilbert space H, satisfying the corresponding Cuntz-Krieger relations, give rise to a partial representation of the free group [formula] on H, that is, a map [formula], satisfying S(t- 1) = S(t)* and S(tr)S(r- 1) = S(t)S(r)S(r- 1) for all r,t in [formula].

In this work we fix a set Λ* of positive elements of [formula] which, among other requirements is assumed to be closed under sub-words, and we take a set [formula] of partial isometries on H. We define a map [formula] by [formula], where S(ri) = Sj if ri = gj, S(ri) = S*j if ri = g- 1j and [formula] is in reduced form.

Under certain conditions studied by Matsumoto in [formula], we prove that the map S is a partial representation of [formula] on H. Since Matsumoto's conditions generalize the Cuntz-Krieger relations our result is a generalization of Exel's result mentioned above.

This paper is based on the author's Master's thesis at the Federal University of Santa Catarina under the supervision of Ruy Exel.

Partial Representations of [formula]

Let us consider the Free Group [formula] generated by a set of n elements, [formula]. The elements of [formula] can be written in the form [formula] where each [formula]. We say that r is in reduced form if ri  ≠  r- 1i + 1, for each i. Two elements [formula] and [formula] of [formula], in reduced form, are equal if and only if l = k and ri = si, for all i. In this way, each element, in reduced form, have unique representation and we define its length by the number of components, that is, if [formula] is in reduced form then r have length k, which will be denoted by |r| = k. A element [formula] of [formula], in reduced form, is called a positive element if ri∈G, for all i, and the set of all positive elements will be called P. We consider e a element of P.

Let us fix a set Λ*  ⊆  P with the following properties:

e∈Λ*,

[formula],

Λ* is closed under sub-words, that is, if [formula] then each element of the form [formula] with [formula] is a element of Λ*.

For all μ∈Λ* we define the following sets:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof: Suppose by contradiction that v  ≠  v'. Then |v|  ≠  |v'|, because otherwise, [formula], from where it follows that v = v'. Without loss of generality suppose |v| > l, write [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], then [formula], and therefore [formula]. Since v'∈Llμ, by definition of Llμ, μv'∉Λ*, hence [formula]. That is a contradiction, because v∈Lkμ and so v = v'. [formula]

Let us consider a Hilbert space H and a set of partial isometries [formula]. Recall that Si is a partial isometry if SiS*iSi = Si. Define a map

where r is in reduced form, S(ri) = Sj if ri = gj and S(ri) = S*j if ri = g- 1j. By convention, S(e) = I, where I is the identity operator on H. In this way, for all [formula] we have an operator S(r)∈L(H).This operator will also be called Sr. We will suppose that our set of partial isometries [formula] generated a map S which satisfies:

[formula];

For all μ and ν in Λ* the operators SμS*μ and S*νSν commute;

[formula], [formula].

Note that for all i, SiS*i is idempotent and self-adjoint, and so a projection. By (M1), [formula] is a projection and therefore SiS*i and SjS*j are orthogonal, for all i  ≠  j. So

[formula]

whenever i  ≠  j.

Proof: The proof will be by induction on |μ|. For |μ| = 1, Sμ = SμS*μSμ by hypothesis. Suppose Sμ = SμS*μSμ for all μ∈Λ* with |μ| = k, and consider ν∈Λ*, with |ν| = k + 1. Then ν  =  αgj, with |α| = k, and

[formula]

[formula]

Proof:

Supposing that there exists r in P such that α  =  νr, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, if α  ≠  νr for all r∈P, write [formula], [formula] and take the smallest index i such that αi  ≠  νi. Then we have [formula], and so

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

because S*νiSαi = 0.

Suppose ν  =  αr for some r∈P. Then

[formula]

If ν  ≠  αr, for all r∈P as in (a), take the smallest index i such that νi  ≠  αi. Then [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

because S*νiSαi = 0.

[formula]

Proof: Write ν = gjα, and in this way,

[formula]

We will analyse the summands of [formula] in the following way:

Case 1: |μ| > |α| By Lemma [formula], [formula] only if μ  =  αr, for some r∈P. We will show that there exists no such r. Suppose μ∈Lkgj is such that μ  =  αr, with |r| = l. By definition of Lkgj, [formula], but [formula], and so ν = gjα∈Λ*. This is a contradiction, because we are supposing ν∉Λ*. Therefore μ  ≠  αr, for all r∈P, and so, by Lemma [formula], [formula] for all μ with |μ| > |α|.

Case 2: |μ|  ≤  |α| By Lemma [formula], [formula], only if α  =  μr, for some r em P, and by Lemma [formula] if there exists such [formula], it is unique. In this case we have by Lemma [formula] that [formula]

In this way, [formula], where z = 0 if there exists [formula] such that α  =  μr for some r∈P, and z = 1 otherwise. Write [formula] and take the smallest index i such that [formula]. So,

[formula]

where zi are 0 or 1. We will show that [formula]. Since [formula], by case 1 and case 2 above, we need to show that there exist some [formula] such that [formula] for some r∈P. Take the index j such that [formula] but [formula]. Such index exists because νi∈Λ* and [formula]. Moreover, [formula] because [formula], and so, [formula]. Thereby [formula], and so S*νSν = 0, in other words, Sν = 0. [formula]

Observe that if [formula] is in reduced form, with ri∈G- 1 and ri + 1∈G, then S(riri + 1) = S(ri)S(ri + 1) = 0, from where S(r) = 0. Also, if [formula] and [formula] are elements of [formula] in reduced form and rk  ≠  s- 11, then the reduced form of rs is [formula], and so S(rs) = S(r)S(s) by definition of S.

Proof: Property P1 is trivial. The proof of P2 will be by induction on |t|. If |t| = 1, the equality between S(t- 1) and S(t*) is obviously true. Suppose S(t- 1) = S(t*) for all [formula] with |t| = k. Take [formula] with |t| = k + 1 and write [formula], where [formula]. Using the induction hypothesis and the fact that the equality is true for |x| = 1,

[formula]

[formula]

To verify property P3 we will prove the following : If [formula] where r is in its reduced form, with ri∈G- 1 and ri + 1∈G for some i, then S(r) = 0 and so the claim is trivial . Therefore let r = αβ- 1, where r is in reduced form and α,β∈P. If β∉Λ*, by Theorem [formula], Sβ = 0 from where we again see that the claim follows. Thus let us consider β∈Λ*.

|α|  ≠  0. Write [formula]. If α1  ≠  gj, then S(gj)*S(α) = 0 and so E(t)E(r) = 0 = E(r)E(t). If α1 = gj we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and similarly S(gj)S(gj)*S(α) = S(α). It follows that E(t) and E(r) commute.

|α| = 0. We have r = β- 1. Since β∈Λ*, using M2,

[formula]

[formula]

Case 2: If t∈G- 1, namely, t = g- 1j, with gj∈G.

Note that

[formula]

[formula]

and similarly,

[formula]

To prove that E(t) and E(r) commute, it is enough to show that

[formula]

|α|  ≠  0.

|α|  ≥  |μ|. By Lemma [formula], if α  =  μs for some s in P then [formula] Therefore,

[formula]

and similarly SμS*μE(r) = E(r), and this proves that E(r)SμS*μ = SμS*μE(r). Also by Lemma [formula], if α  ≠  μs for all s∈P, then [formula] and also in this case E(r) and SμS*μ commute.

|α| < |μ|. By Lemma [formula], if [formula], then [formula], from where the equality follows. If μ  =  αs for some s∈P, also by Lemma [formula], [formula] and [formula], from where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since β∈Λ*, by M2,

[formula]

and this shows that E(r)SμS*μ = SμS*μE(r).

|α| = 0 Since β∈Λ*, the equality between E(r)SμS*μ and SμS*μE(r) follows from M2.

This proves our claim. Let us now return to the proof of P3, that is,

[formula]

To do this we use induction on |t| + |r|. The equality is obvious if |t| + |r| = 1. Suppose the equality true for all [formula] such that |t| + |r| < k. Take [formula], with |t| + |r| = k, write [formula], with [formula]. If y  ≠  x- 1, we have S(tr) = S(t)S(r), from where S(tr)S(r- 1) = S(t)S(r)S(r- 1). Let us consider the case x = y- 1.

[formula]

[formula]

Using the claim and the fact that S(x) is a partial isometry,

[formula]

[formula]

and by the induction hypothesis,

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

[formula]

This concludes the proof of P3, and also of the theorem . [formula]
