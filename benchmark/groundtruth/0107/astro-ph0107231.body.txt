Mass composition of cosmic rays in anomalous diffusion model: comparison with experiment

Introduction

The steepening of the all-particle spectrum around 3  ·  1015eV (the "knee") discovered in 1958 [\citep=KandK:1958] has been the subject of numerous speculations on the propagation and acceleration mechanisms of galactic cosmic rays (see, for example, the reviews by [\citet=Erlykin], [\citet=KandK:1995], [\citet=Ptuskin:1997]). The usually accepted picture of cosmic ray propagation in the interstellar medium is a normal diffusion, which can be described by equation for concentration [\citep=Ginzburg_and_Syr:1964] [\citep=Berezinsky:1990]

[formula]

The "knee" is not an intrinsic property of this model under the natural physical conditions D(E)  ~  Eδ, S(E)  ~  E- p. Because of these reasons discussions have mainly been directed to a search and a justification of breakdown mechanisms either of the diffusivity D(E) or of the source density S(E). However, in spite of considerable theoretical and experimental efforts, a model, which can explain

different values of spectral exponent of protons and other nuclei,

mass composition variations at E  ~  102  ÷  105 GeV/nucleon,

the steepening of the all-particle spectrum

was not developed.

Recently, in our papers [\citep=LagNikUch:2000] [\citep=LagNikUch:2001] [\citep=LNUIzvRAN:2001] new view of the "knee" problem was presented. It has been shown that the "knee" in the primary cosmic rays spectrum is due to fractal structure of the interstellar medium, that is another regime of particles diffusion in the Galaxy.

In this paper we consider the propagation of galactic cosmic rays in the fractal interstellar medium taking into account that a particle can spend long time in a trap. We demonstrate the main results of this new model in a wide energy region E  ~  (1  ÷  108) Gev/nucleon.

Model

Based on the results [\citep=LU:this_conf.] the cosmic ray propagation in the fractal interstellar medium is described by fractional diffusion equation. Without energy losses and nuclear interactions, the equation for concentration of the cosmic rays with energy E generated by sources [formula] has the form

[formula]

where D(E,α,β) is the anomalous diffusivity, α and β are determined by the fractal structure of the medium and by the trapping mechanism, correspondingly (see [\citet=LU:this_conf.]). Dμ0 + denotes the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, ( - Δ)α / 2 -- the fractional Laplacian [\citep=samko].

In the case of point impulse source with inverse power spectrum, relating to supernova bursts

[formula]

the solution of equation ([\ref=fracdifeq]), found in [\citep=LagNikUch:2001] is of the form

[formula]

where the scaling function Ψ(α,β)3(r),

[formula]

is determined by three-dimensional spherically-symmetrical stable distribution q(α)3(r) (α  ≤  2) and one-sided stable distribution q(β,1)1(t) with characteristic exponent β [\citep=Znanie:1983] [\citep=Chance:1999].

The anomalous diffusivity D(E,α,β) is determined by the constants A and B in the asymptotic behaviour for "Lévy flights" (A) and "Lévy waiting time" (B) distributions:

[formula]

Taking into account that both the free path and the probability to stay in trap during the time interval t for particle with charge Z and mass number A depend on particle magnetic rigidity R, we accept D = (υ / c)D0(α,β)Rδ.

Using the representation N = N0E-  η and the property dΨ(α,β)m / dr =  - 2πrΨ(α,β)m + 2 of the scaling function [\citep=Chance:1999], one can easy find the spectral exponent η for observed particles:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let E0 be a solution of the equation Ξ(E) = 0. One can see from ([\ref=eta])-([\ref=Xi]) that at E = E0 the spectral exponent for observed particles η is equal to spectral exponent for particles generated by the source: η(E0) = p. Since the exponent ηE  ≪  E0 = p - δ is less than p at E  ≪  E0, but the exponent ηE  ≫  E0 = p + δ  /  β > p at E  ≫  E0, E0 can be called the "knee" energy.

From experimental values of ηE  ≪  E0 and ηE  ≫  E0 one can derive the main parameters of the model (p,δ) versus the spectral exponent (β) of "the Lévy waiting time":

[formula]

To evaluate the parameter β we have used the results presented in the paper [\citep=Cadavid:1999], where an anomalous diffusion of solar magnetic elements have been investigated. The authors have shown that the trapping time distribution asymtotically takes the form of a Lévy distribution with spectral exponent β  ≈  0.8.

Assuming that a trapping mechanism is characterized by a kind of self-similarity, one can expect the some value for β in the scales under the consideration . By this reason the value β = 0.8 is used in our calculations.

Thus, taking ηE  ≪  E0  ~  2.63 and ηE  ≫  E0  ~  3.24 we finally obtain p  ≈  2.9, δ  ≈  0.27.

To evaluate the next important parameter -- anomalous diffusivity D0(α,β), we have used the experimental data on the particle anisotropy in the the energy region 103  ÷  104 GeV/particle in the framework of the scheme proposed by [\citet=Osborn:1976] and [\citet=Dorman:1985]. For example, we find D0  ≈  (1  ÷  4)  ·  10- 3 pc1.7y- 0.8 in the case α = 1.7, β = 0.8 for near sources Monogem (r  ~  300 pc, t  ~  105 y), Geminga (r  ~  300 pc, t  ~  3  ·  105 y), Loop I-IV (r  ~  (100  ÷  200) pc, t  ~  (2  ÷  4)  ·  105 y).

In the model under consideration only one parameter α (1 < α  <  2) connected with the fractal structure of the interstellar medium is found by fit. Extensive calculations of cosmic-ray spectra show that the best fit of experimental data may be get at α  ≈  1.7.

Spectra and mass composition

The differential flux Ji of the particles of type i due to all sources of Galaxy may be separated into two components

[formula]

The first component (L) in ([\ref=J_i]) describes the contribution of the nearby sources (at distance r  ≤  1kpc) to observed flux Ji. The second component (G) is the contribution of the distant sources (r > 1kpc) to Ji. The similar separation is frequently used in the studies of cosmic rays (see, for instance, [\citet=Atoyan:1995]).

The list of nearby sources including 16 supernova remnants [\citep=Nichimura1] [\citep=Nichimura2] [\citep=Lozinskaya] is used to calculate the L-component. The distant sources are supposed to be distributed uniformly both in space and time. In this case JG(r > 1kpc)  ~  E- p - δ  /  β (see [\citet=steady-state_sol.]).

Based on this result and ([\ref=N(r] [\ref=t] [\ref=E]), we present the differential flux in the form:

[formula]

It is clear from physical point of view that the bulk of observed cosmic rays with energy 108  ÷  1010eV forms by numerous distant sources. It means that the observed flux at least of protons and He in this energy region must be described by second term in ([\ref=J_result]). The first term in ([\ref=J_result]) defines the spectrum in the high energy region and, as has been shown above, provides the "knee".

We use the spherically symmetric force model of [\citet=Axford] to describe the solar modulation. The influence of solar modulation on the particle flux is

[formula]

where T is the kinetic energy per nucleon, mp is the mass of a proton and JISM is the interstellar flux ([\ref=J_result]). The potential energy Φ, describing the average energy loss of particle from interstellar space to 1 AU, is determined by solar modulation parameter φ: Φ  =  φZ / A. φ = 750MV is accepted in this paper (see [\citet=b108] [\citet=Menn:2000]).

The results of our calculation are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig1], and Table [\ref=tab1].

Conclusion

We have considered the propagation of galactic cosmic rays in the fractal interstellar medium. The energy spectra of nuclei (H, He, CNO, Ne-Si, Fe) and mass composition have been calculated in energy region (1  ÷  108) GeV/particle under the natural physical conditions D(E)  ~  Eδ, S(E)  ~  E- p. We have shown that the model can explain the different values of spectral exponent of protons and other nuclei, mass composition variations at E  ~  102  ÷  105 GeV/nucleon, the steepening of the all-particle spectrum.
