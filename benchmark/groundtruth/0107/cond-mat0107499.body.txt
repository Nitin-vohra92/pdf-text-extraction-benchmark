The future is noisy: on the role of spatial fluctuations in genetic switching

The Darwinistic theory of evolution through mutation and selection is based on occasional errors in the process of biological reproduction [\cite=darwin]. At the same time, a biological system has to be locally stable in the sense that a mutation occurs only once within a large number of generations of a species. Biological systems, faced with thermal activation at room temperature therefore have to find a way to minimise the influence of noise. Particular interest in this concern is focused on genetic switches, a relatively simple unit in a biological cell at hand of which the effects of noise can be studied.

Genetic switches constitute a part of the centre of command of biological cells. By deciding which of two genetic codes within the corresponding DNA section is transcribed, the switch prompts the production of certain molecules inside the cell, and thus it controls the subsequent reactions and the feedback: the genetic switch governs the future state of the cell. In fact, the associated interplay of different chemical reactions resembles a logical electric circuit, and biochemists have therefore coined the notion of genetic circuitry [\cite=ptashne] [\cite=alberts] [\cite=arkinross]. Genetic switches, depending on their functional task, come either non-cooperative or cooperative. Roughly speaking, cooperative switches will always be concerned with the control of vital processes such as reproduction, non-cooperativity is associated with less precision and concerns processes like respiration. For a large number of cellular systems, the steric and kinetic aspects of the biochemistry of the molecules involved in genetic switching have been explored to great detail, and it has been investigated how and where cooperativity originates. In general, cooperative switches are much more robust against noise [\cite=ptashne] [\cite=alberts].

The paradigm model for a cooperative genetic switch is the system made up by the host bacterium Escherichia coli which is infected by the parasitic bacteriophage T4 (λ-phage). λ injects its own DNA into the host cell where the λ-DNA fuses with the bacterium DNA. Thus, λ is able to abuse the host cell facilities to either remain dormant and get reproduced along with the bacterium ( lysogeny), or fuse new λ-phages by the help of the host cell's miniature chemical plants, the process of lysis. The latter eventually leads to an array of a large number of new λ inside E.coli. Finally the host cell bursts and releases a swarm of new λ's [\cite=ptashne] [\cite=alberts]. Which of the two paths, lysis or lysogeny, is followed, is determined by a genetic switch which, in turn, is triggered by messenger molecules which we call repressor R (the protagonist lysogeny agent) and aggressor [formula], the antagonist lysis agent.

The typical, overall number of messenger molecules within a biological cell like E.coli is relatively small, ranging from a few to some 100. On the one hand, the chemical processes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the messenger molecules are noisy and, to some approximation, described by a master equation [\cite=vankampen]. Noise means that at some given time there is a surplus in the molecule synthesis in respect to the degradation, and the overall number of the respective molecule increases; and vice versa. That means that even in a state which is stationary on average, fluctuations in the number of the molecules occur. It has been extensively studied in how far the system can be influenced by such noise due to the feedback circle [\cite=arkinross] [\cite=shea] [\cite=ko] [\cite=peccoud] [\cite=mcadamsarkin] [\cite=cook] [\cite=bialek] [\cite=sneppen]. Note that this aspect of noise enters only in the number of involved molecules as a function of time.

On the other hand, it might be argued that the spatial distribution of these molecules, governed by Brownian motion, may give additional cause for the influence of noise. Usually, it is replied that the system is well-stirred, and therefore the molecules are always close enough to the switch on the DNA such that the spatial effects can be neglected. With the typical diffusion constant K  ~  2  ·  10- 6cm2  /   sec for a molecule of 50Å size, the average diffusion time it takes to cross the cell is of the order of one to a few msec. Processes affected by genetic switching occur on time scales of the order of cell division of one or a number of cell generations, typically tens of minutes or longer. The molecules, on this long time scale, are therefore well-mixed within the cell. The effects of noise on the switching process can, under this well-stirredness assumption, be considered directly in the biochemical circuit [\cite=arkinross] [\cite=shea] [\cite=ko] [\cite=peccoud] [\cite=mcadamsarkin] [\cite=cook] [\cite=sneppen], or it can be thought of as an activation process [\cite=bialek].

However, we will show that the involved system parameters are not consistent with the above reasoning, and that well-stirredness alone is not sufficient to obtain a complete picture of the process. In contrast, we give evidence that the overall process consists of a large number of subprocesses during which there is an ongoing competition between the protagonist and antagonist molecules which in turn gives rise to the influence of spatial fluctuations on genetic switching. Essentially, the reason for this claim is that the cell volume is large in comparison to both the size of the messenger molecules involved and the van der Waals (vdW) interaction radius around the operator sites on the DNA. If one divides the cell volume into compartments of the size of this vdW radius, the occupation of individual compartments by the few molecules in the entire cell shows large fluctuations in time.

In what follows, we exclusively consider the effects of spatial fluctuations in the above compartment picture. We distinguish the non-cooperative and the cooperative cases, and our model switch is supposed to work according to the following simple rules. (i) The non-cooperative switch gives rise to the state of lysogeny if one R is bound to the operator. This R can dissociate from the operator with some time constant, and it can be replaced by another molecule, R or [formula], which is within the vdW interaction volume (IV). If either another R substitutes the dissociated one, or the operator remains vacant, the dormant state is preserved. The switch is flipped, and lysis initiated, if eventually an [formula] molecule binds to the operator site. (ii) In the cooperative case, two R's can bind to the operator. In this configuration, the first facilitates the binding of the second. Only if both R's dissociate from the operator and are eventually replaced by one [formula], the switch flips towards lysis. Thus, after full dissociation of the R (or R's) from the operator, the question for both cases is whether there is at least one R and/or [formula] within the IV. If only one species is present, we assume that binding of one molecule of this species necessarily occurs. If both species are present, we introduce a (1 - χ) factor in favour of R binding (and χ in favour of [formula] binding).

Consequently, our model can be rephrased as a renewal process in the following sense. As the distribution of messenger molecules outside the IV is irrelevant, the occupation of the IV can be regarded independent of the previous occupation after the diffusion time it takes a molecule to cross the IV, the renewal time δt. With the typical vdW radius of 100Å, we find with the above K that δt  ~  10- 6 sec. Keeping track of the systems at "stroboscopic" times [formula], we can employ a simple statistical analysis. The basic ingredients are the probabilities Π0 and Λ0 that neither R nor [formula] is inside the IV, and that there is at least one such molecule present, 1 - Π0 and 1 - Λ0. If p = {  /  } is the probability that a single molecule is within IV, and there are NR and [formula] molecules of either species within the cell, we find Π0 = (1 - p)NR and [formula] [\cite=remc].

Let us collect some relevant numbers. The radius of E.coli is of the order of 1μm, and the free volume in which the messenger molecules diffuse within the cell is ~  1μm3 [\cite=rema]. Comparing to the vdW radius, we obtain [formula]. Note that for these numbers, the probability that none out of 100 molecules is within the IV, (1 - p)100  ≈  99.5%, is still very close to 1. The presence of such small numbers which give rise to the fact that the associated probabilities are either close to 0 or to 1 is the reason for the relevance of spatial fluctuations.

Consider first the non-cooperative case. Assume that the bound R molecule dissociates with the characteristic time scale τ. Excluding that the molecule does not immediately rebind, one witnesses a competition between the two kinds of messenger molecules which can possibly bind to the relevant operator sites. This competition is characterised through the four events P1  =  Π0Λ0, P2 = (1 - Π0)Λ0, P3 = (1 - Π0)(1 - Λ0), P4  =  Π0(1 - Λ0) which define the joint presence or absence of the two types of molecules. These four configurations can be subdivided into those which leave the genetic switch in the dormant mode, i.e., which prevent an [formula] molecule from binding to the operator site, and those which lead to [formula] binding to its operator. The former comprise P1 and P2, the latter is given through P4. In turn, P3 defines a mixed state whose mean outcome will be (1 - χ) in favour of R binding, and χ in favour of [formula] binding. The probability for inhibition is thus Pinhib = P1 + P2 + (1 - χ)P3, the one for lysis is Plys = 1 - Pinhib.

The whole process can therefore be stripped down to the occurrence of a number i of inhibition events, terminated by a step leading to lysis, i.e., lysis will eventually occur according to a sequence [formula] with joint probability PiinhibPlys and normalisation N = Plys / (1 - Pinhib) = 1. The mean time to obtain lysis according to this diffusion picture is [formula], resulting in 〈δt〉  =  δt / Plys. The quantity 〈δt〉 increases with growing NR, with decreasing [formula], or with decreasing χ, as it should. 〈δt〉 is the time due to the diffusion renewal process. To obtain the overall characteristic time for lysis, we have to add the binding times of order τ. This delay can be included through the average number of steps [formula], weighted by the probability (P2 + (1 - χ)P3) that a renewal step actually involves a rebinding of an R. Multiplied by τ and added to 〈δt〉, this leads to the characteristic lysis time

[formula]

which will be discussed in comparison to the time scale in the cooperative case.

As mentioned, the cooperative scenario involves two R molecules. If one is already bound to an operator site, it facilitates the binding of another R molecule to the second operator site reserved for R such that χ  ≈  0. Usually, two R's are bound. The antagonist molecule [formula] can only bind and initiate the divergence to the lytic track if both R sites are vacated. I.e., if the one R dissociates and does not rebind during the dissociation time of the second R. Moreover, one has to consider that not each time both R's are dissociated, [formula] binds. In fact, some R molecule can bind to the operator sites and restart the dissociation process. As usually more R than [formula] are within the cell, this case occurs more often, on average. Thus, if the characteristic time τII for the dissociation of the second R is large in comparison to the renewal time δt, a sufficiently high number of R molecules makes it rather improbable that the R-related operator sites remain unoccupied long enough as to allow for the complete dissociation of R to occur: the characteristic time for lysis in the cooperative case should be considerably higher than for the non-cooperative case [\cite=REMM].

To quantify this cooperative process, let us assume that s = τII  /  δt is the number of renewal steps corresponding to the dissociation time of the second R that is still bound. After dissociation, 1 - Π0 defines the probability that, in one given renewal step, an R molecule binds to the vacant operator site and reconstitutes the initial configuration with two R's bound to the DNA. The probability that during δt no such reconstitution occurs is given by Π0. The probability that reconstitution occurs in less than s renewal steps is then described by the combined process [formula], obtaining [formula]. The target process for finding the possibility for lysis thus corresponds to one of the following cascades of events, [formula], [formula], [formula] where [formula]. I.e., a certain number of superprocesses [formula] occurs during which reconstitution takes place, and finally no R replaces the dissociated first R until the second R dissociates, too. The associated mean number of "superprocesses" [formula] is [formula]. In order to estimate the characteristic time connected to this process, we have to include two contributions. The first is the average time consumed by an [formula] superprocess; that is, [formula] δt(1 - Πs0 + sΠs + 10 - sΠs0) / (1 - Π0). The second is the dissociation time τI elapsing after each re-binding of R. Finally, as not each complete dissociation of the two R molecules leads to a successful binding of the antagonist [formula] molecule, we obtain the characteristic time scale

[formula]

for the occurrence of cooperative lysis. In Eq. ([\ref=Tco]), the time constant for complete dissociation of both R's is given by [formula] It is due to the additional weighting through [formula] that Tlysc exceeds Tlysnc considerably.

Both characteristic times can be evaluated numerically. Essentially, the non-cooperative lysis time Tlysnc, for a fixed number [formula], grows almost linearly in NR, compare Fig. [\ref=fig1]. In contrast, Tlysc grows almost exponentially for fixed [formula], eventually reaching extremely large values for higher NR. For NR = 1, both characteristic times coincide, as they should. Conversely, for fixed NR, both characteristic lysis times fall off like a power law for increasing [formula].

These results are in qualitative agreement to those obtained from models considering exclusively number fluctuation: cooperativity enhances the accuracy of the system (the resistance against noise) exponentially, compare, e.g., [\cite=bialek]. As our diffusion based model can lead to significantly large lysis times which can be of the same order of magnitude as the results from the number fluctuation models or even larger, depending on the assumed parameters, it may not be sufficient to consider number fluctuations only. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the well-stirredness assumption is no sufficient a priori condition to exclude the spatial inhomogeneities arising from the spatial diffusion of the molecules. This is based on the fact that each dissociation-rebinding process is influenced by the fairly high probability that no molecules are in the interaction volume during a renewal step.

It should be emphasised that our results are sensitive to the very numbers which are assumed for obtaining estimates for the characteristic lysis times. A small variation of these numbers can lead to a large change in the final result, so for a given system the parameters should be carefully verified before estimates like the ones obtained herein are calculated.

The basic ingredient of our model is the separation of the entire free cell volume into a bath constituted by the free diffusion volume, and into the IV. Due to this assumption, the very configuration outside the IV can be neglected. Consequently, for Monte Carlo simulations of the combined process in which both the number of molecules and their spatial variation are random, the concept of the IV versus the free volume might prove useful in stripping off the unnecessary details and lowering the computation time.

Our renewal time scenario relies on the existence of a more or less homogeneous distribution of the messenger molecules throughout the free diffusion volume such that the net exchange with the IV is approximately stationary. In prokaryotic cells, this assumption should always be realised. It should also be valid in eukaryotes which feature a highly structured cell volume as long as there are no adsorption processes at cellular membranes which lead to immobilisation of the molecules according to a broad waiting time distribution which would give rise to a diverging exchange rate [\cite=report].

By and large, in biophysics and biochemistry the role of noise in genetic circuitry, and cellular systems as a whole, has been increasingly assessed. This Letter shows that the spatial aspect of such fluctuations should not be neglected a priori, and its relevance for the process should be checked.

We finally remark that genetic switches are paradigmatic systems at hand of which effects of noise are studied. The developed renewal-diffusion scenario therefore essentially pertains to a large variety of systems and processes involving lowly populated species which are spatially distributed and trigger followup processes on entering some interaction zone, ranging from cellular feedback circles to clustering of bacteria, or to animal populations. In conclusion, there is no a priori well-stirredness condition for such systems.
