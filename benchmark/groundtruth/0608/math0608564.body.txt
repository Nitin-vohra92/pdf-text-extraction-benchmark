Congruences on Stirling numbers and Eulerian numbers

Introduction

As usual, we set [formula] and

[formula]

We also set [formula] for any negative integer k.

Let p be a prime, and let n > 0,r be integers. In 1913, A. Fleck (cf. [\cite=Di], p. 274) discovered that

[formula]

where ⌊  ·  ⌋ is the floor function. In 1977, C. S. Weisman [\cite=We] extended Fleck's congruence to prime power moduli in the following way:

[formula]

where α is a positive integer.

In 2005, in his lecture notes on Fontaine's rings, D. Wan got another extension of Fleck's congruence:

[formula]

where [formula] and n > lp. Later, by a combinatorial approach, Z. W. Sun [\cite=Su1] established a common generalization of Weisman's and Wan's extensions of Fleck's congruence:

[formula]

provided that α  ≥  β  ≥  0 and n  ≥  pα - 1, where [formula] is the p-adic order of [formula].

In fact, with help of ψ-operator in Fontaine's theory of (φ,Γ)-modules, ([\ref=w1]) and ([\ref=su1]) can be improved as follows [\cite=Wa]:

[formula]

And a combinatorial proof of ([\ref=w2]) is given in [\cite=SW1]. On the other hand, motivated by algebraic topology, D. M. Davis and Z. W. Sun [\cite=DS] [\cite=SD] showed that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=ds]) and ([\ref=sd]) can't be deduced from ([\ref=w2]). For the further developments on ([\ref=w2]) and ([\ref=ds]), the reader may refer to [\cite=Su2] [\cite=SW1] [\cite=SW2] [\cite=Su3].

The Stirling number s(n,k) of the first kind denotes the number of permutations of [formula] which contain exactly k permutation cycles. s(n,k) (0  ≤  k  ≤  n) can be given by

[formula]

Similarly, the Stirling number [formula] of the second kind is the number of ways to partition a set of cardinality n into k nonempty subsets. It is well known that

[formula]

for [formula]. In particular, we set s(0,0) = S(0,0) = 1 and s(n,k) = S(n,k) = 0 whenever k > n.

The Eulerian numbers are another special numbers related to permutations. For an arbitrary permutation [formula] of [formula], we say that an element [formula] is an ascent of π if ai < ai + 1. The Eulerian number [formula] is the number of permutations of [formula] having k ascents (cf. [\cite=GKP], p. 267). (Another commonly used notation is A(n,k) (sometimes An,k) with [formula].) Clearly [formula] and [formula] for every k > n - 1. We also set [formula] when k < 0. It is easy to check that the Eulerian numbers satisfy the recurrence relation

[formula]

Stirling numbers and Eulerian numbers play important roles in enumerative combinatorics. In this paper, motivated by ([\ref=w2]) and ([\ref=sd]), we shall give some similar congruences for the Stirling numbers and the Eulerian numbers. Firstly, we have the following result for the Eulerian numbers. The results on Stirling numbers are a little complicated. Also, we have the following Weisman type congruence. The proofs of Theorems [\ref=mt1]-[\ref=mt3] will be given in the next sections.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=mt1]

We use an induction on n. There is nothing to do when n = 0. Below we assume that n  ≥  1 and ([\ref=S4]) holds for smaller values of n. Obviously ([\ref=S4]) holds for k = 0. Suppose that k  ≥  1. It is known (cf. [\cite=Co], p. 209) that

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

By the induction hypothesis, for k - 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 we have

[formula]

This concludes our proof.

It is sufficient to prove ([\ref=E1]) for f(x) = xl, [formula]. In the case l = 0, ([\ref=E1]) reduces to

[formula]

It is true (cf. [\cite=GKP], p. 269). Now assume that l > 0 and ([\ref=E1]) holds for l - 1, that is,

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Therefore ([\ref=E1]) holds for l. We are done.

Let ζ be a primitive pα-th root of the unity. Note that [formula] is a polynomial in x with the degree l. By Lemma [\ref=ecl2], we have

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=ecl1] and ([\ref=w2]), for every 0  ≤  m  ≤  n we have

[formula]

This concludes the proof.

Let ζ be a primitive pα-th root of the unity. Using ([\ref=E2]) we have

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=ecl1] and (1.8) of [\cite=Su1],

[formula]

for every 0  ≤  m  ≤  n. This ends the proof.

Congruences for Stirling numbers: [formula]

In this section, we shall prove Theorem [\ref=mt2]. Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) denote the rational p-adic integers ring (resp. field).

We may choose [formula] such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

This concludes that [formula] since [formula].

Let ω be the Teichmüller character of the multiplicative group [formula]. We know that

[formula]

are exactly all (p - 1)-th roots of unity in [formula]. And if g is a primitive root of p, then ω(g) is a (p - 1)-th primitive roots of unity. Let [formula] be an arbitrary (p - 1)-th primitive roots of unity in [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Therefore applying Lemma [\ref=scl1],

[formula]

It is easy to check that

[formula]

Hence when n  ≥  l  ≥  1

[formula]

We use an induction on deg f. The case deg f = 0 follows from ([\ref=sc1]) by setting m = 1. Below we assume that deg f > 0 and ([\ref=sc2]) holds for the smaller values of deg f. It is known (cf. [\cite=Co], p. 215) that

[formula]

Write f(x) = xf1(x) + c with deg f1  =   deg f - 1. Then

[formula]

When i = 0,

[formula]

For every 0 < i  ≤  n - 1, by the induction hypothesis,

[formula]

where l' =  min { deg f - 1,⌊i / p⌋}. It suffices to show that

[formula]

When i > n - p, clearly l - 1  ≤  l'  ≤  l and ordp(n - i) = 0. Hence

[formula]

Below assume that i  ≤  n - p. If deg f - 1  ≤  i / p, then applying Lemma [\ref=scl2],

[formula]

since deg f  ≤  ⌊i / p⌋ + 1  ≤  ⌊n / p⌋ now. Also, when i / p <  deg f - 1, we have

[formula]

provided that ⌊i / p⌋  <  ⌊n / p⌋. In two above cases, we both obtain that

[formula]

This concludes our proof.

Congruences for Stirling numbers: [formula]

In this section, we shall prove Theorem [\ref=mt3]. Define

[formula]

Let ζd be a primitive d-th root of the unity. Then

[formula]

Let x be a. Apparently

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

By the Lucas congruence, we know that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

which is obviously equivalent to ([\ref=scl3e]).

Apparently

[formula]

Also observe that

[formula]

Hence without loss of generality, assume that pα divides n. We make an induction on n. Clearly the cases n < pα + 1 is trivial. Let ζ be a primitive pα(p - 1)-th root of unity. Then

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=scl3], we have

[formula]

since pα|n and

[formula]

by the induction hypothesis on n. When p|a, clearly now

[formula]

And if [formula],

[formula]

Thus it suffices to show that

[formula]

Note that n  ≥  pα now. If α = 1, then by ([\ref=sc1])

[formula]

Also if α  ≥  2, by an induction on α, we have

[formula]

All are done.
