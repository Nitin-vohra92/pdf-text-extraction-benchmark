A remark On Irregularity of the [formula]-Neumann problem on non-smooth domains

Let Ws(Ω) and Ws(p,q)(Ω) denote the L2-Sobolev space on Ω of order s and the space of (p,q)-forms with coefficient functions in Ws(Ω), respectively. Also [formula] denotes the norms on Ws(p,q)(Ω). Let Nq denote the inverse of the complex Laplacian, [formula], on square integrable (0,q)-forms. It is an observation of Kohn, as the following proposition says, that on a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain the [formula]-Neumann problem is regular in the Sobolev scale for sufficiently small levels.

Let Ω be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in [formula]. There exist positive ε and C (depending on Ω) such that

[formula]

for u∈Ws(0,q)(Ω) and 1  ≤  q  ≤  n.

We show that if one drops the smoothness assumption then the [formula]-Neumann operator, N1, may not map any positive Sobolev space into itself continuously.

There exists a bounded pseudoconvex domain Ω in [formula], smooth except one point, such that the [formula]-Neumann operator on Ω is not bounded on Ws(0,1)(Ω) for any s > 0.

We will build the domain by attaching infinitely many worm domains (constructed by Diederich and Fornæss in [\cite=DF]) with progressively larger winding. Let Ωj be a worm domain, a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain, in [formula] that winds 2πj such that

[formula]

for [formula]. Let γj be a straight line that connects an extreme point on the cap of Ωj to a closest point on the cap of Ωj + 1. Then using the barbell lemma (see [\cite=FS] [\cite=HW]) we get a bounded pseudoconvex domain Ω that is smooth except one point (0,0)∈bΩ. Notice that Ω is the union of Ωj  ⊂  Ω for [formula] and all connecting bands. In the rest of the proof we will show that if the [formula]-Neumann operator on Ω is continuous on Ws(0,1)(Ω) then the [formula]-Neumann operator on Ωj is continuous on Ws(0,1)(Ωj) for [formula]. However this is a contradiction with a theorem of Barrett([\cite=B92]). Let us define [formula] on L2(0,1)(Ωj), and [formula] on L2(0,1)(Ω). Let us fix j and choose a defining function ρ for Ωj such that [formula] on bΩj. Let [formula] and J denote the complex structure of [formula]. Now we will construct a smooth cut off function that fixes the domain of [formula] and [formula] under multiplication. We can choose open sets U1,U2, and U3 and χ∈C∞0(U2) such that

U1  ⊂    ⊂  U2  ⊂    ⊂  U3,

U1,U2, and U3 contain all boundary points of Ωj that meet the (strongly pseudoconvex) band created using γj and γj - 1, and they do not contain any weakly pseudoconvex boundary point of Ωj,

0  ≤  χ  ≤  1, [formula] on U1,

there exists an open set U such that [formula] and the following two ordinary differential equations can be solved in U

[formula]

Notice that [formula] and [formula] on U1, and [formula] in a neighborhood of the set of weakly pseudoconvex boundary points of Ωj. We choose a neighborhood V  ⊂    ⊂  U of bΩj and [formula] such that [formula] in a neighborhood [formula] of bΩj. Let us define [formula] and ξ  =  ψ + iφ. We like to make some observation about ξ that will be useful later:

[formula] on [formula],

[formula] on bΩj,

[formula] in a neighborhood of the weakly pseudoconvex boundary points of Ωj.

Claim: If [formula] then [formula] and [formula].

Proof of Claim: First we will show that [formula] then we will talk about how one can show that [formula].

One can easily show that [formula] (on Ωj). On the other hand, by Kohn-Morrey-Hörmander formula [\cite=shaw] since the L2-norms of any "bar" derivatives of any terms of f on Ωj is dominated by [formula] we have [formula]. So we need to show that [formula]. Since [formula] we only need to show that [formula]. We will use the special boundary frames. Let

[formula]

Also let wτ and wν be the dual (1,0)-forms. We note that Lν  =  ν - iJ(ν) and so [formula] on bΩj. We can write [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. Using the fact that fν∈W10(Ωj) (it is easy to see this for [formula]. For [formula] one can use the fact that Δ:W10(Ωj)  →  W- 1(Ωj) is an isomorphism and the density lemma [\cite=shaw] to see this) and [formula] is smooth we may reduce the problem of showing [formula] to show the following

[formula]

Let {φk}∞k = 1 be a sequence of smooth compactly supported functions converging to [formula] in C1-norm and u be a (0,1)-form with smooth compactly supported coefficient functions in Ωj. Then

[formula]

where 〈,〉Ωj is the inner product on forms on Ωj. If we integrate by parts and use [formula] for l = τ,ν we can reduce the problem of showing [formula] to showing that [formula] and [formula] are finite. One can show that On the second equality we used integration by parts. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

for m = 1,2 and a positive constant C that does not depend on f. In the last inequality we used the fact that L2-norms of f and the "bar" derivatives of fτ on Ωj are bounded by [formula]. We remark that it is essential that ξ is complex valued and Ω is smooth in a neighborhood of [formula]. Therefore, we showed that [formula].

As for (1 - ξ)f being in [formula]. Since [formula] in a neighborhood of the boundary points of Ωj that meets the band created using γj and γj - 1 we have [formula] on [formula]. Also since [formula] similar calculations as before show that [formula]. This completes the proof of the claim.

We will use generalized constants in the sense that [formula] means that there is a constant C = C(s,Ωj) > 0 that depends only on s and Ωj but not on A or B such that [formula]. Assume that the [formula]-Neumann operator on Ω maps Ws(0,1)(Ω) into itself continuously for some s > 0. That is, [formula] for h∈Ws(0,1)(Ω). Then we have [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Since [formula] in a neighborhood of the weakly pseudoconvex boundary points of Ωj we can use pseudolocal estimates on Ωj (see [\cite=KN]) to get

[formula]

Let us choose η to be a smooth compactly supported function that is constant 1 around the support of [formula] and zero in a neighborhood of the weakly pseudoconvex points of Ωj. Therefore, we have

[formula]

The first inequality comes from the assumption that the [formula]-Neumann operator on Ω is continuous on Ws(0,1)(Ω). The second inequality comes from the fact that [formula] operates as Laplacian componentwise on forms. In the last inequality we used the pseudolocal estimates as we did in ([\ref=pseudolocal]). Therefore we showed that

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. One can check that this is equivalent to the condition that the [formula]-Neumann operator on Ωj is continuous on Ws(0,1)(Ωj).

One can check that [formula] maps Ws(0,1)(Ω) into Ws(Ω) continuously if and only if [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. Using this observation one can give a proof, similar to the proof of the theorem, for the following corollary.

There exists a bounded pseudoconvex domain Ω in [formula], smooth except one point, such that [formula] is not bounded from Ws(0,1)(Ω) into Ws(Ω) for any s > 0.

It is interesting that for a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain Ω in [formula] the operator [formula] is bounded from Ws(0,1)(Ω) into Ws(0,2)(Ω) for any s  ≥  0. (One can use (4) in [\cite=BS90] to see this).

We would like to note the following additional property for the domain we constructed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. There is no open set U that contains the non-smooth boundary point of Ω such that [formula] has a Stein neighborhood basis. That is, non-smooth domains may not have a "local" Stein neighborhood basis. However, this is not the case for smooth domains (see for example [\cite=R86]).
