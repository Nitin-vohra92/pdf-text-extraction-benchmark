The prime analog of the Kepler-Bouwkamp constant

Begin with a circle of radius R1 and circumscribe it with an equilateral triangle. Circumscribe the triangle with another circle. Let the radius of the second circle be R2. Circumscribe the second circle with a square. Continue in this manor, circumscribing with a circle, then a regular pentagon, circle, regular hexagon, ad infinitum, each time adding one more side to the regular polygon. The limit of the ratio of the radius of the outer circle to the inner is which is sometimes referred to as the polygon circumscribing constant [\cite=sloane]. Since we have If, instead of circumscribing, we inscribed at each step we get the Kepler-Bouwkamp constant [\cite=finch], which is What if only regular polygons with prime (greater than 2) number of edges are considered? In other words, what is

where p denotes the primes [formula]?

Taking the natural log of both sides of equation ([\ref=eq:kp]),

[formula]

Expanding the summand,

[formula]

where Bn is the nth Bernoulli number, which can be obtained from Using the identity where ζ is the Riemann zeta function, equation ([\ref=eq:lnsec]) becomes Thus, equation ([\ref=eq:lnkp]) can be written as a double sum,

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:lnkp2]) is absolutely convergent; the order of summation can be interchanged, viz. The summation over the primes can be written in terms of the prime zeta function, which is Thus,

[formula]

Perhaps the only unfamiliar term is the prime zeta function, but this can be evaluated in terms of the more familiar Riemann zeta function using the identity [\cite=titchmarsh] where μ is the Möbius function.

Equation ([\ref=eq:lnkp4]) quickly converges; taking the exponential gives The prime analog of the Kepler-Bouwkamp constant is We also have, with no extra work, the following products over the positive nonprimes, [formula], and
