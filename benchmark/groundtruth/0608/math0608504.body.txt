Monopole classes and Perelman's invariant of four-manifolds

Introduction

In his celebrated work on the Ricci flow [\cite=P1] [\cite=P2], G. Perelman introduced an interesting invariant of closed manifolds of arbitrary dimension. By definition, Perelman's invariant is closely related to the Yamabe invariant or sigma constant. For three-manifolds that do not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature, Perelman's work [\cite=P1] [\cite=P2] shows that his invariant is equivalent to M. Gromov's minimal volume [\cite=gromov], which is a priori a very different kind of invariant.

In this paper we calculate Perelman's invariant for compact complex surfaces and show that it essentially coincides with the Yamabe invariant:

Let Z be a minimal complex surface with b1(Z) even and with b+2(Z) > 1. Then Perelman's invariant for the manifold [formula] is given by

[formula]

The supremum defining [formula] is realized by a metric if and only if k = l = 0 and Z admits a Kähler-Einstein metric of non-positive scalar curvature.

We also give calculations and estimates for some other classes of four-manifolds, see in particular Theorems [\ref=t:symp], [\ref=t:kK3], and [\ref=t:2]. Our results are applications, and, in some cases, generalizations of the recent results of F. Fang and Y. Zhang [\cite=FZ], who discovered a relationship between Perelman's invariant and solutions of the Seiberg-Witten monopole equations on four-manifolds. In particular, Fang and Zhang [\cite=FZ] already noted that Perelman's invariant is not a homeomorphism invariant. Our Theorems [\ref=t:kK3], [\ref=t:2] and [\ref=t3] contain quantitative results elaborating on this observation.

As a consequence of Seiberg-Witten theory it is now well known that the Yamabe invariant is in fact sensitive to the smooth structure of a four-manifold. As was pointed out in [\cite=entropies], this is also true for Gromov's minimal volume, although this is harder to prove than for the Yamabe invariant. In Theorem [\ref=t:2] below we prove that the vanishing or non-vanishing of the minimal volume does depend on the smooth structure, and then discuss the relationship between this result and Perelman's invariant.

Perelman's invariant

We recall the basic definition from [\cite=P1], compare also [\cite=KL] [\cite=FZ].

Let M be a closed oriented manifold of dimension n  ≥  3. For a Riemannian metric g on M and a function f∈C∞(M), Perelman defines

[formula]

where sg is the scalar curvature of g. Then Perelman's invariant of the Riemannian metric g is

[formula]

This infimum is actually a minimum, because it coincides with the smallest eigenvalue of the operator d*d + sg. It follows that λM(g) depends continuously on g. If the scalar curvature sg is constant, then λM(g) = sg.

The quantity

[formula]

is scale invariant, and can be used to define a diffeomorphism invariant of M by setting

[formula]

We shall call [formula] Perelman's invariant of M.

If the supremum in [\eqref=eq:PP] is achieved, then the corresponding metric has to be Einstein, cf. [\cite=P1] [\cite=KL]. We will see that very often this is not possible, so that the supremum is not a maximum.

Recall that for a conformal class C on M, the Yamabe invariant of C is defined by

[formula]

By the solution to the Yamabe problem due to H. Yamabe, N. Trudinger, T. Aubin and R. Schoen, this infimum is always realized by some metric g0 of constant scalar curvature s0. Such a metric is called a Yamabe metric. For a Yamabe metric g0∈C we have

[formula]

The Yamabe invariant of M is defined as

[formula]

By the above calculation this can be written as

[formula]

Comparing this with the definition [\eqref=eq:PP] of Perelman's invariant, we obtain the fundamental inequality

[formula]

between the Yamabe and Perelman invariants of M.

Monopole classes

Consider now a closed smooth oriented four-manifold X with a [formula]-structure [formula]. For every choice of Riemannian metric g, the Seiberg-Witten monopole equations for [formula] with respect to g are a system of coupled equations for a pair (A,Φ), where A is a [formula]-connection in the spin bundle for [formula] and Φ is a section of the positive spin bundle V+. The equations are:

[formula]

[formula]

with D +  A the half-Dirac operator defined on spinors of positive chirality, and Â the connection induced by A on the determinant of the spin bundle. The right-hand side of the curvature equation [\eqref=eq:curv] is the 2-form which, under the Clifford module structure determined by [formula], corresponds to the trace-free part of [formula].

Solutions (A,Φ) with [formula] are called reducible. If there is a reducible solution, then [formula] is represented by an anti-self-dual harmonic form because of [\eqref=eq:curv]. This implies c2  ≤  0, with equality if and only if c is a torsion class.

The following definition is due to P. Kronheimer [\cite=Kr], see also [\cite=monopoles].

A class [formula] is called a monopole class, if there is a [formula]-structure [formula] on X with [formula] for which the monopole equations [\eqref=eq:D] and [\eqref=eq:curv] admit a solution (A,Φ) for every choice of metric g.

Of course, on manifolds for which the Seiberg-Witten invariants are well-defined, every basic class is a monopole class. The rationale for considering the concept of a monopole class is that the existence of solutions to the monopole equations has immediate consequences, even when the corresponding invariants vanish.

The following result from [\cite=FZ] establishes an important relation between the Seiberg-Witten equations and Perelman's invariant:

If the monopole equations [\eqref=eq:D] and [\eqref=eq:curv] for [formula] with respect to g admit an irreducible solution (A,Φ), then

[formula]

where c+1 denotes the projection of [formula] to the g-self-dual subspace of [formula].

If c+1  ≠  0, then equality in [\eqref=eq:FZ] can only occur if g is a Kähler metric of constant negative scalar curvature.

The proof is an adaptation of the usual scalar curvature estimate for solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations obtained by combining the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula with the equations, cf. [\cite=Wi].

The following is a slight generalization of Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=FZ]:

Let X be a smooth closed oriented 4-manifold with a monopole class c that is not a torsion class and satisfies c2  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

Because c is assumed to be a monopole class, there is a [formula]-structure [formula] with [formula] such that the monopole equations for [formula] have a solution (A,Φ) for every choice of metric g. If the solution is irreducible, i. e. Φ  ≠  0, then [\eqref=eq:FZ] implies

[formula]

If c2 > 0, then it is clear that all solutions are irreducible. If c2 = 0, then we use the assumption that c is not a torsion class, to argue that solutions must be irreducible for generic g. In fact, this follows from:

Let [formula] be a non-torsion class. If b+2(X) > 0, then for a generic metric g, there is no anti-self-dual harmonic form representing the image of c in [formula].

A proof of the lemma can be found in [\cite=DK]. In our case the intersection form must be indefinite because there is a non-torsion class of square zero, and thus b+2(X) > 0 holds. Therefore we obtain the desired estimate for generic metrics g. As Perelman's invariant [formula] depends continuously on g, the estimate holds for all g.

Next we adapt the proof of Theorem 4.2 in [\cite=monopoles] to show that in the presence of a monopole class, Perelman's invariant can be used to bound the number of smooth exceptional spheres in a four-manifold.

Let X be a smooth four-manifold with a monopole class c. The maximal number k of copies of [formula] that can be split off smoothly is bounded by

[formula]

Suppose that [formula], with k > 0, and write [formula], with respect to the obvious direct sum decomposition of [formula]. Here ei are the generators for the cohomology of the [formula] summands. Note that the ai are odd integers because c must be characteristic. In particular c can not be a torsion class.

Now the reflections in the ei are realised by self-diffeomorphisms of X, and the images of our monopole class under these diffeomorphisms are again monopole classes. Thus, moving c by a diffeomorphism, we can arbitrarily change ei to its negative.

Given a metric g on X, we choose the signs in such a way that aie+i  ·  c+Y  ≥  0. Then we find

[formula]

If g is generic, then there are irreducible solutions to the monopole equations, and applying [\eqref=eq:FZ] to c and g gives

[formula]

Combining the two inequalities and noting that a2i  ≥  1 because all the ai are odd integers shows

[formula]

for generic g. By continuity of Perelman's invariant this holds for all g, giving [\eqref=eq:split].

It may not be obvious why this Theorem is interesting, but this should become clear by looking at the following special case:

Let Z be a minimal symplectic four-manifold with b+2(Z) > 1, and [formula]. Then

[formula]

The case l = 0 was previously proved by Fang and Zhang in Theorem 1.4 of [\cite=FZ].

Let [formula], which we can think of as a symplectic blowup. By the result of C. Taubes [\cite=T], the first Chern class c1(Y) of a symplectic structure is a Seiberg-Witten basic class with numerical Seiberg-Witten invariant ±  1. In particular, it is a monopole class on Y.

Now consider X = Y  #  l(S1  ×  S3). Although its numerical Seiberg-Witten invariants must vanish, cf. [\cite=KMT] [\cite=Bourbaki], we claim that each of the basic classes with numerical Seiberg-Witten invariant =    ±  1 on Y gives rise to a monopole class on Z. There are two ways to see this. One can extract our claim from the connected sum formula [\cite=B] for the stable cohomotopy refinement of Seiberg-Witten invariants introduced by S. Bauer and M. Furuta [\cite=BF], cf. [\cite=F]. Alternatively, one uses the invariant defined by the homology class of the moduli space of solutions to the monopole equations, as in [\cite=Bourbaki]. This means that the first homology of the manifold is used, and here this is enough to obtain a non-vanishing invariant. Using this invariant, our claim follows from Proposition 2.2 of P. Ozsváth and Z. Szabó [\cite=OS]. See also K. Froyshov [\cite=Fro].

We apply [\eqref=eq:split] to X with the monopole class [formula] to obtain

[formula]

As [formula] is non-positive in this case, the claim follows.

In this argument the expected dimension of the moduli space of solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations is = 0 on Y, but is = l on X. As explained in [\cite=monopoles], results like Theorem [\ref=t:split] are stronger the larger the expected dimension of the moduli space is.

In the case of Kählerian complex surfaces we can combine this upper bound for Perelman's invariant with the lower bound given by the Yamabe invariant to obtain a complete calculation.

Every compact complex surface Z with even first Betti number admits a Kähler structure, and is therefore symplectic. For simplicity we are assuming b+2(Z) > 1, so that surfaces of negative Kodaira dimension do not occur. For Z with a Kähler structure of non-negative Kodaira dimension, holomorphic and symplectic minimality coincide, cf. [\cite=HK]. Thus Z is symplectically minimal and we can apply Theorem [\ref=t:symp] to obtain

[formula]

For the reverse inequality consider first the case k = l = 0, i. e. X = Z. Then we have [formula] by [\eqref=eq:YP], and, if Z is of general type, then the Yamabe invariant μZ equals [formula] by the result of C. LeBrun [\cite=lebrun]. This is easy to see when Z admits a Kähler-Einstein metric of negative scalar curvature, cf. [\cite=lebrun] [\cite=FZ]. In the case when such a metric does not exist, one has to consider sequences of metrics which suitably approximate an orbifold Kähler-Einstein metric on the canonical model of Z, see [\cite=lebrun]. If Z is not of general type, then c21(Z) = 0, and Z is either a K3 surface, an elliptic surface, or an Abelian surface, cf. [\cite=BPV]. In all these cases Z does not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature, but it does collapse with bounded scalar curvature, in fact even with bounded Ricci curvature, see LeBrun [\cite=lebrun3]. Collapsing with bounded scalar curvature can also be seen from the result of G. Paternain and J. Petean [\cite=PP] that Z has an F-structure. Because Z collapses with bounded scalar curvature, its Yamabe and Perelman invariants vanish. This completes the proof of [\eqref=eq:cx] in the case k = l = 0.

Now we allow k and l to be positive. By Proposition 4.1 of Fang and Zhang [\cite=FZ], Perelman's invariant does not decrease under connected sum with [formula] and with S1  ×  S3. As the upper bound [\eqref=eq:inter] is achieved on Z and is unchanged by the connected sum, we conclude that it is an equality for all positive k and l as well.

Finally we discuss the question whether the supremum in the definition of [formula] is a maximum. If this is the case, then the corresponding metric on X is an Einstein metric. If Z is of general type, then c21(Z) > 0, and we can use the discussion of the equality case in Proposition [\ref=p:FZ] to conclude that the critical metric on X is Kähler as well, and the scalar curvature is negative. This implies k = l = 0. If Z is not of general type then c21(Z) = 0. Now the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality [\cite=HT] for the Einstein metric implies k = l = 0. We are then in the case of equality of the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality, and X = Z is Ricci-flat Kähler.

Instead of using the behaviour of Perelman's invariant under connected sum, one can alternatively argue with the corresponding result for the Yamabe invariant (and for F-structures).

Theorems [\ref=t:symp] and [\ref=t:cx] have extensions to the case of manifolds with b+2 = 1. For the latter one also has to consider rational and ruled symplectic manifolds, which do admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and therefore have positive Perelman invariant.

Examples and applications

In this section we give some examples illustrating the estimates and calculations of Perelman's invariant, with special emphasis on its dependence on the smooth structure.

First, we have the following:

The number of distinct values that Perelman's invariant can take on the smooth structures in a fixed homeomorphism type of simply connected four-manifolds is unbounded.

By the standard geography results for minimal surfaces of general type going back to U. Persson [\cite=per], compare also [\cite=BPV], we can do the following: for every positive integer n we find positive integers x and y with the properties that all pairs (x - i,y + i) with i running from 1 to n are realized as (c2(Zi),c21(Zi)) for some simply connected minimal complex surface Zi of general type. Let Xi be the i-fold blowup of Zi. Then all the Xi for i from 1 to n are simply connected and non-spin and have the same Chern numbers (x,y). Therefore, by M. Freedman's result [\cite=freed] they are homeomorphic to each other. However, by the above Theorem [\ref=t:cx], the Xi have pairwise different Perelman invariants.

While this construction does produce arbitrarily large numbers of distinct Perelman invariants among homeomorphic four-manifolds, it can never produce infinitely many. Of course it is now easy to construct manifolds with infinitely many distinct smooth structures admitting symplectic forms. However, Theorem [\ref=t:symp] does not seem to be strong enough to show that their Perelman invariants take on infinitely many values. Therefore, we leave open the following:

On a suitable homeomorphism type, the Perelman invariant takes on infinitely many distinct values.

There are also spin manifolds with smooth structures with several distinct Perelman invariants:

The manifold X = 3K3  #  4(S2  ×  S2) has:

a smooth structure X0 with [formula],

a smooth structures X1 with [formula],

infinitely many smooth structures Xi with [formula].

The supremum defining the Perelman invariant is attained for X1, but not for X0 and the Xi.

The smooth structure X0 is the standard one given by the connected sum. By the Lichnerowicz argument it has no metric of positive scalar curvature. As it does collapse with bounded scalar curvature, we conclude [formula]. If this supremum were attained, then the corresponding metric would have to be Ricci-flat. As the signature is non-zero, we would have a parallel harmonic spinor, showing that the manifold is Kähler, which is clearly not possible.

The smooth structure X1 underlies the complex algebraic surface obtained as the double cover of the projective plane branched in a smooth holomorphic curve of degree 10. This is homeomorphic to X by [\cite=freed]. By Theorem [\ref=t:cx], [formula]. As the canonical bundle of X1 is ample, X1 has a Kähler-Einstein metric of negative scalar curvature by the results of T. Aubin [\cite=A] and S.-T. Yau [\cite=Y] on the Calabi conjecture. This metric achieves the supremum for the Perelman invariant.

The smooth structures Xi are constructed as follows, cf. [\cite=monopoles]. Let M be a symplectic spin manifold with c21(M) = 16 and χ(M) = 4, where [formula] denotes the holomorphic Euler characteristic. Such manifolds exist by the results of D. Park and Z. Szabó [\cite=PS]. By Freedman's classification [\cite=freed], such an M is homeomorphic to K3  #  4(S2  ×  S2). Take N = K3, and O the symplectic spin manifold obtained from K3 by performing a logarithmic transformation of odd multiplicity i. By the connected sum formula for the stable cohomotopy refinement of the Seiberg-Witten invariants due to Bauer and Furuta [\cite=BF] [\cite=B], the connected sum M  #  N  #  O has monopole classes c which are the sums of the basic classes on the different summands. Note that c2 = 16. Therefore [formula] by Theorem [\ref=t:symp]. It was shown in [\cite=monopoles] that as we increase i, the multiplicity of the logarithmic transformation, we do indeed get infinitely many distinct smooth structures. It was also shown in [\cite=monopoles] that the Xi do not admit any Einstein metrics. Therefore, the supremum for the Perelman invariant can not be achieved for them.

The manifold X has another infinite sequence of smooth structures, which are distinct from the ones discussed above. R. Fintushel and R. Stern [\cite=FScusp] have shown that one can perform cusp surgery on a torus in S to construct infinitely many distinct smooth structures which are irreducible and non-complex, and are therefore distinct from the smooth structures we consider. These smooth structures have negative Perelman invariants, and it is unknown whether they admit Einstein metrics.

One can give many similar examples on larger manifolds. We can even obtain interesting results for parallelizable manifolds:

For every k  ≥  0 the manifold Xk = k(S2  ×  S2)  #  (1 + k)(S1  ×  S3) with its standard smooth structure has zero minimal volume and Perelman invariant [formula].

If k is odd and large enough, then there are infinitely many pairwise non-diffeomorphic smooth manifolds Yk homeomorphic to Xk, all of which have strictly positive minimal volume and strictly negative Perelman invariant. Moreover, the supremum in the definition of the Perelman invariant is not achieved. All the Yk have the property that Yk  #  (S2  ×  S2) is diffeomorphic to Xk  #  (S2  ×  S2).

Note that X0 = S1  ×  S3 has obvious free circle actions, and therefore collapses with bounded sectional curvature. To see that all Xk have vanishing minimal volume it suffices to construct fixed-point-free circle actions on them, cf. M. Gromov [\cite=gromov].

The product S2  ×  S2 has a diagonal effective circle action which on each factor is rotation around the north-south axis. It has four fixed pints, and the linearization of the action induces one orientation at two of the fixed points, and the other orientation at the remaining two. The induced action on the boundary of an S1-invariant small ball around each of the fixed points is the Hopf action on S3. By taking equivariant connected sums at fixed points, pairing fixed points at which the linearizations give opposite orientations, we obtain effective circle actions with 2 + 2k fixed points on the connected sum k(S2  ×  S2) for every k  ≥  1. Now we have 1 + k fixed points at which the linearization induces one orientation, and 1 + k at which it induces the other orientation. Then making equivariant self-connected sums at pairs of fixed points with linearizations inducing opposite orientations we finally obtain a free circle action on Xk = k(S2  ×  S2)  #  (1 + k)(S1  ×  S3).

That the Perelman invariant of Xk is infinite follows from the fact that this is so for S2  ×  S2.

If k is odd and large enough, then there are symplectic manifolds Zk homeomorphic (but not diffeomorphic) to k(S2  ×  S2), see for example B. Hanke, J. Wehrheim and myself [\cite=HKW]. By the construction given in [\cite=HKW], we may assume that Zk contains the Gompf nucleus of an elliptic surface. By performing logarithmic transformations inside this nucleus, we can vary the smooth structures on the Zk in such a way that the number of Seiberg-Witten basic classes with numerical Seiberg-Witten invariant =    ±  1 becomes arbitrarily large, cf. Theorem 8.7 of [\cite=FSrat] and Example 3.5 of [\cite=monopoles].

Consider Yk = Zk  #  (1 + k)(S1  ×  S3). This is clearly homeomorphic to Xk. The basic classes on Zk give rise to monopole classes which are special in the sense of [\cite=monopoles]. As their number is unbounded, we have infinitely many distinct smooth structures. By the construction given in [\cite=HKW], the Zk dissolve after a single stabilization with S2  ×  S2, and therefore the same is true for the Yk.

As Yk has non-torsion monopole classes c with c2 = 2χ(Zk) + 3σ(Zk) = 4 + 4k > 0, we find that [formula] from Theorem [\ref=t:symp]. This supremum is not achieved, because Yk is parallelizable but not flat, and can therefore not carry an Einstein metric by the discussion of the equality case of the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality [\cite=HT]. Note that Yk can not collapse with bounded scalar curvature. A fortiori it cannot collapse with bounded sectional curvature, and so its minimal volume is strictly positive.

That connected sums of manifolds with vanishing minimal volumes may have non-vanishing minimal volumes is immediate by looking at connected sums of tori. The manifolds Xk discussed above have the property that their minimal volumes vanish, although they are connected sums of manifolds with non-vanishing minimal volumes. Thus the minimal volume, and even its (non-)vanishing, does not behave in a straightforward manner under connected sums.

This remark was motivated by the recent preprint of G. Paternain and J. Petean [\cite=PPnew]. After an earlier version of Theorem [\ref=t:2] appeared on the arXiv in [\cite=entropies], these authors remarked on the complicated behaviour of the minimal volume under connected sums based on some 6-dimensional examples, see Remark 3.1 in [\cite=PPnew].

The insistance on manifolds that dissolve after a single stabilization with S2  ×  S2 was originally motivated by C. T. C. Wall's theorem [\cite=W] showing that every simply connected smooth four-manifold dissolves after some number of stabilizations with S2  ×  S2. On the one hand, because of work of R. Mandelbaum, B. Moishezon and R. Gompf, and also because of [\cite=BK] [\cite=HKW], we now know that one stabilization often suffices. On the other hand, there are no examples where it is known that one stabilization does not suffice. Perelman's invariant sheds some unexpected light on this, because after a single stabilization with S2  ×  S2 Perelman's invariant tends to become infinite. In particular, after a single stabilization there are no more non-torsion monopole classes. It is tempting to speculate that the Ricci flow might be useful in investigating the question whether manifolds do indeed always dissolve after a single stabilization.

Going in the opposite direction of Conjecture [\ref=con], we have the following:

There are homeomorphism types of simply connected four-manifolds that contain infinitely many distinct smooth structures with the same Perelman invariant.

The easiest example is furnished by the homeomorphism type underlying the K3 surface. This is spin with non-zero signature, and so by the Lichnerowicz argument no manifold in this homeomorphism type admits a metric of positive scalar curvature. However, there are infinitely many smooth structures underlying complex elliptic surfaces in this homeomorphism type. As all these collapse with bounded scalar curvature, their Perelman invariants vanish.

In this case the supremum for the Perelman invariant is attained for the standard smooth structure, but not for any of the other ones. This is because the standard smooth structure is the only one admitting an Einstein metric. These were in fact the first examples showing that the existence of an Einstein metric depends on the smooth structure, cf. [\cite=K].

If we only look for arbitrarily large numbers of distinct smooth structures, rather than for infinitely many, then we can choose examples with non-vanishing Perelman invariants. For example, V. Braungardt and I proved in [\cite=BK] that there are arbitrarily large tuples of non-diffeomorphic minimal surfaces of general type with ample canonical bundles. By Theorem [\ref=t:cx] above on any such tuple the Perelman invariant is a negative constant. As shown in [\cite=BK], these examples can be chosen to be spin or non-spin. In the non-spin case they also have infinitely many other, non-complex, smooth structures which, by Theorem [\ref=t:symp], have even smaller Perelman invariant.
