HIGHER DIMENSIONAL SUPERSYMMETRY

Introduction

Quaternions were very first example of hyper complex numbers having the significant impacts on mathematics & physics [\cite=key-1] . Because of their beautiful and unique properties quaternions attached many to study the laws of nature over the field of these numbers. Quaternions are already used in the context of special relativity [\cite=key-2], electrodynamics [\cite=key-3] [\cite=key-4], Maxwell's equation[\cite=key-5], quantum mechanics[\cite=key-6] [\cite=key-7], Quaternion Oscillator[\cite=key-8], gauge theorie [\cite=key-9] [\cite=key-10] , Supersymmetry [\cite=key-11]and many other branches of Physics[\cite=key-12] and Mathematics[\cite=key-13].On the other hand supersymmetry (SUSY) is described as the symmetry of bosons and fermions[\cite=key-14] [\cite=key-15] [\cite=key-16]. Gauge Hierarchy problem, not only suggests that the SUSY exists but put an upper limit on the masses of super partners[\cite=key-17] [\cite=key-18]. The exact SUSY implies exact fermion-boson masses, which has not been observed so far. Hence it is believed that supersymmetry is an approximate symmetry and it must be broken [\cite=key-19] [\cite=key-20]. We have considered following two motivations to study the higher dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics[\cite=key-21] over the field of Quaternions.

1. Supersymmetric field theory can provide us realistic models of particle physics which do not suffer from gauge hierarchy problem and role of quaternions will provide us simplex and compact calculation accordingly.

2. Quaternions super symmetric quantum mechanics can give us new window to understand the behavior of supersymmetric partners and mechanism of super symmetry breaking etc.

3. Quaternions are capable to deal the higher dimensional structure and thus include the theory of monopoles and dyons.

Keeping these facts in mind and to observe the role of quaternions in supersymmetry, the theory of quaternion harmonic oscillator has been analyzed for the systems of bosons and fermions respectively in terms of commutation and anti commutation relations. Eigen values of particle Hamiltonian and number operators are calculated by imposing the restriction on the component of quaternion variables. Accordingly, the super charges are calculated and it is shown that the Hamiltonian operator commutes with the super charges representing the conversion of a fermionic state to a bosonic state and vice versa. Quaternion reformulation of N= 1 , 2 and 4 dimension supersymmetry has been investigated in terms of supercharges and super partner potential and quaternion mechanics has also been analyzed in terms of complex and quaternion quantum mechanics for N = 2 and N = 4 SUSY respectively. It has been shown that elegant frame work of quaternion quantum mechanics includes non Abelian gauge structure in contradiction to complex quantum mechanics of supersymmetry corresponding to N= 2, complex and N= 4 real dimension of supersymmetry.

Definition

A quaternion φ is expressed as

[formula]

Where φ0,φ1,φ2,φ3are the real quartets of a quaternion and e0,e1,e2,e3 are called quaternion units and satisfies the following relations,

[formula]

The quaternion conjugate [formula] is then defined as

[formula]

Here φ0is real part of the quaternion defined as

[formula]

Re    φ  =  φ0 = 0 , then φ =  -  and imaginary φ is called pure quaternion and is written as

[formula]

The norm of a quaternion is expressed as

[formula]

and the inverse of a quaternion is described as

[formula]

While the quaternion conjugation satisfies the following property

[formula]

The norm of the quaternion ([\ref=eq:6]) is positive definite and enjoys the composition law

[formula]

Quaternion ([\ref=eq:1]) is also written as [formula]where [formula] is its vector part and φ0is its scalar part. The sum and product of two quaternions are

[formula]

Quaternion elements are non-Abelian in nature and thus represent a division ring.

Field Associated with Dyons

Let us define the generalized charge on dyons as [\cite=key-22] [\cite=key-23],

[formula]

where e and g are respectively electric and magnetic charges. Generalized four potential [formula]associated with dyons is defined as,

[formula]

where [formula]and [formula]are respectively electric and magnetic four potentials. We have used throughout the natural units [formula]. Electric and magnetic fields of dyons are defined in terms of components of electric and magnetic potentials as,

[formula]

These electric and magnetic fields of dyons are invariant under generalized duality transformation i.e.

[formula]

The expression of generalized electric and magnetic fields given by equation ([\ref=eq:13]) are symmetrical and both the electric and magnetic fields of dyons may be written in terms of longitudinal and transverse components. The generalized vector electromagnetic fields associated with dyons is defined as

[formula]

As such, we get the following differential form of generalized Maxwell's equations for dyons i.e.

[formula]

where j0 and [formula], are the generalized charge and current source densities of dyons, given by;

[formula]

Substituting relation ([\ref=eq:13]) into equation ([\ref=eq:15]) and using equation ([\ref=eq:12]), we obtain the following relation between generalized vector field and potential of dyons i.e.

[formula]

where electric and magnetic four current densities[formula])and [formula]Thus we write the following tensor forms of generalized Maxwell's-Dirac equations of dyons i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The tidle denotes the dual part while εμνσλ are four indexes Levi-Civita symbol. Generalized fields of dyons given by equation ([\ref=eq:13]) may directly be obtained from field tensors Fμνand μν as,

[formula]

A new vector parameter S (say) may directly be obtained [\cite=key-10] [\cite=key-12]from equation ([\ref=eq:16])i.e.

[formula]

where [formula]represents the D' Alembertian operator i.e.

[formula]

Defining generalized field tensor as

[formula]

We may directly obtain the following generalized field equation of dyons i.e.

[formula]

where Gμν = Vμ,ν - Vν,μis called the generalized electromagnetic field tensor of dyons. Equation ([\ref=eq:26]) may also be written as follows like second order Klein-Gordon equation for dyonic fields;

[formula]

where we have imposed the Lorentz gauge condition on both potentials and consequently to generalized potential. Equations ( [\ref=eq:19]) and ([\ref=eq:26]) are also invariant under duality transformations;

[formula]

where

[formula]

and consequently the generalized charge of a dyon may be written as

[formula]

The suitable Lagrangian density, which yields the field equation ([\ref=eq:26]) under the variation of field parameters (i.e. potential only) without changing the trajectory of particle, may be written as follows;

[formula]

where * denotes the complex conjugate. Lagrangian density given by equation ([\ref=eq:32]) directly leads the following expression of Lorentz force equation of motion for dyons i.e.

[formula]

Where Re denotes real part and [formula] is the four-velocity of the particle.

Quaternion SUSY Harmonic Oscillator

Let us define bosonic quaternion oscillator as the extension of complex oscillator having the decomposition [\cite=key-8]as,

[formula]

where â0,â1,â2,â3are real operators . Let us defined the conjugate of equation ([\ref=eq:34]) as

[formula]

Like other oscillator, we start with the following fundamental boson commutation relations i.e.

[formula]

Then to maintain the above relations of bosonic oscillator,we get the following commutation relation between the components of bosonic oscillator in terms of imaginary quaternion units i.e.

[formula]

or

[formula]

Let us describe the Hamiltonian for bosonic harmonic oscillator as

[formula]

which can be written in terms of as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then it is necessary to recover the ordinary commutation relation [formula] [formula] between [formula] .So, we get

[formula]

Now we can define the number operator as

[formula]

which thus commutes with Hamiltonian [formula]i.e.

[formula]

Bosonic number operator satisfies the following relations;

[formula]

which shows that â and [formula]may be regarded as annihilation and creation operators. We also have

[formula]

and the Hilbert space is then spanned by state vectors as

[formula]

where [formula] is considered as ground or vacuum state and then must be normalized as

[formula]

and thus gives rise to the familiar results

[formula]

Similarly we can write the following anti commutation relation for fermionic harmonic oscillator

[formula]

where [formula] is a fermionic quaternion operator and may be decomposed as

[formula]

To satisfy the relations ([\ref=eq:50]) by fermion operators given by equation ([\ref=eq:51]) , it is necessary to impose the following restrictions on the various components of operators i.e.,

[formula]

We have defined through out the text [formula] as commutator, [formula]as anti commutator and εjkl is three index Levi- Civita symbol. Like bosonic harmonic oscillator let us define the fermionic Hamiltonian as ,

[formula]

Where [formula] and   can take eigen values nf = 0,1.The Hilbert space with basis vector [formula] is now constructed in the following manner so that

[formula]

The energy eigen spectra of fermionic oscillator have only two levels for eigen state [formula]or [formula] i.e. [formula] and [formula]showing that ground state energy of this oscillator is negative i.e. [formula] .

Let us now construct a simple supersymmetric quantum mechanical system that include an oscillator with the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .We call it as supersymmetric harmonic oscillator viewed in the frame work of quaternion variables. The supersymmetry is thus obtained by annihilating simultaneously one bosonic quantum and creating one fermionic quantum or vice versa. We illustrate the annihilating (supersymmetric) charges (generators) as

[formula]

So the SUSY Hamiltonian becomes

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and N̂F are respectively bosonic and fermionic number operators. The eigen state is described as[formula] and ground state as [formula]so that

[formula]

and we also have

[formula]

These supercharges represent conversion of a fermionic state to a bosonic state and bosonic state to fermionic state or vice versa i.e.

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq:56]and [\ref=eq:57]) are analogous to following equations of supersymmetry,

[formula]

for μ = 0 and α  =  β = 1namely one dimensional SUSY .Supercharges always commute with the usual Hamiltonian.Thus the anti commuting charges in quaternion formalism combine to form the generators of time translation, namely the Hamiltonian H. The ground state of this system is the state [formula] or [formula]where both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are in the lowest energy state.As such we have analyzed the theory of supersymmetric harmonic oscillator for one dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics and putting the restriction accordingly. Other wise one has to extend the dimensions and to loose the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian of the supersymmetric system.Let us now try to illustrate the Supersymmetry of Dirac equation in terms of quaternion variables.

Supersymmetric Quaternion Dirac Equation

The quaternion formulation of free particle Dirac equation[\cite=key-6] [\cite=key-24] [\cite=key-25] is described as,

[formula]

Let us discuss the supersymmetrization in terms of following three cases.

Case I: For mass less free particle i.e.m = 0 and external potential Φ = 0;

Equation ([\ref=eq:63] )becomes

[formula]

Let us consider the following solutions of this equation as

[formula]

where we have taken natural units c =  and as such we get the following form of equation

([\ref=eq:64])i.e.

[formula]

We define the following representation of gamma matrices in terms of quaternion units i.e.

[formula]

thus equation([\ref=eq:66]) takes the form

[formula]

where ψa  =  ψ0 + i  ψ1and ψb  =  ψ2 - i  ψ3.We thus obtain the following coupled equations

[formula]

where Â   =  - el  p̂l and [formula].We can now decouple equation ([\ref=eq:69]) as

[formula]

where ψa(x) and ψb(x)are eigen functions of partner Hamiltonians [formula] and [formula] .The supersymmetric Hamiltonian is thus described as

[formula]

Restricting the propagation along x-axis to discuss the quantum mechanics in two dimensional space time,we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

where supercharges are described in terms of quaternion units i.e.

[formula]

As such we may obtain the supersymmetry algebra as

[formula]

Here ,converts the upper component spinor [formula]to a lower one [formula]and convert the lower component Spinor [formula]to upper one [formula]. If ψto be an eigen state of H+(H-), [formula]is the eigen state of that of H+(H-)with equal energy.

Case II- [formula]but potential Φ = 0. Corresponding Dirac's equation ([\ref=eq:63]) with its solution ([\ref=eq:65])is described as

[formula]

which may be written as follows in terms of quaternion units i.e.

[formula]

Accordingly ,we have the following sets of equations

[formula]

which are the Schr�dinger equation for free particle.SUSY Hamiltonian is now described as

[formula]

On the similar way we get the following relations while restricting for two dimensional structure of space and time i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

Hence we restore the property of SUSY quantum mechanics and obtain the commutation and anti commutation relations same that of equation ([\ref=eq:75]) for the free particle Dirac equation with mass as well.

Case III- We now discuss and verify the SUSY quantum mechanics relations for [formula] with scalar potential Φ = V.We extend the present theory in the same manner and express Dirac Hamiltonian in the following form;

[formula]

or

[formula]

or

[formula]

where

[formula]

Equations[\eqref=eq:82] to[\eqref=eq:85] satisfy the supersymmetric quantum mechanical relations given by equation ([\ref=eq:75]) and as such the supersymmetry is verified even for interacting case with scalar potential.

Case IV- Dirac equation in Electromagnetic Field-

Before writing the quaternion Dirac equation in generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons let us start with the quaternion gauge transformations. A Q - field ([\ref=eq:1]) is described in terms of following SO(4) local gauge transformations[\cite=key-6] [\cite=key-9];

[formula]

The covariant derivative for this is then written in terms of two gauge potentials as

[formula]

where potential transforms as

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here we identify the non Abelian gauge fields Aμand Bμas the gauge potentials respectively for electric and magnetic charges of dyons described earlier in section-3.Corresponding field momentum of equation ([\ref=eq:87])may also be written as follows

[formula]

where the gauge group SO(4) = SU(2)e  ×  SU(2)g is constructed in terms of quaternion units of electric and magnetic gauges .Accordingly, the covariant derivative thus describes two different gauge field strengths i.e.

[formula]

where fμν and hμν are gauge field strengths associated with electric and magnetic charges of dyons respectively.We may now write the Dirac equation as

[formula]

and accordingly with some restrictions and using the properties of quaternions we may write the Dirac equation as

[formula]

where φa  =  φ0 + iφ1and φb  =  φ2 - iφ3and as such we obtain the following set of equations;

[formula]

[formula]

where we have restricted ourselves to the case of two dimensional supersymmetry by imposing the condition [formula] to restore the supersymmetry.As such it is possible to supersymmetrize the Dirac equation for generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons and we obtain the commutation and anti commutation relations given by equation([\ref=eq:75]) to verify the supersymmetric quantum mechanics in this case.

Higher dimensional Supersymmetry

Quaternion differential operator is defined as

[formula]

which describes

[formula]

and can be decomposed in to two dimensional from as

[formula]

where ([formula]) changes only complex quantities with one quaternion units which plays the role of complex quantity (in C(1,i) case ) and thus is equivalent to

[formula]

Now defining [formula] and [formula]we have the negative of Laplacian [formula]andthus describes two-dimensional free particle Supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Following Das et al[\cite=key-21] we may now construct a two-dimensional supersymmetric theory in the following manner,

[formula]

where [formula] is described as super potential, [formula] and [formula]represents the two dimensional gradient.We may now write the super partner hamiltonians described in the previous sections as[\cite=key-21];

[formula]

as described earlier here also the curly brackets represent anti commutators and εjk is anti symmetric with ε12 = 1 and ε21 =  - 1.It is to be noted that the vector super potential naturally generates a gauge field interaction structure resulting from supersymmetry algebra.Thus it is possible to say that we can take quaternion supersymmetry as N = 4 real supersymmetry because like complex quanties generat two dimensional real representation,accordingly quaternions generate four dimensional real representations. thus we need to define q in such a manner that [formula] and 4-dimensional supersymmetry algebra can be built accordingly in terms of three non commutating quantities but associative quantities like three quaternion units. ej. Let us assume that q in free space can be written as a linear super position in terms of pure quaternion units consisting non-Abelian gauge structure and are obtained from q with [formula], i.e.

[formula]

and we may write equation ([\ref=eq:99]) as

[formula]

where we may write [formula]with [formula].The vector super potential depends on the position as

[formula]

and accordingly we may obtain the super partner Hamiltonians [formula]and [formula] interms of interacting super potential [\cite=key-21] with the assumption that the gauge interaction structure naturally arises from the requirement of super symmetry in ters of quaternions and gauge theory of dyons be dealt in this manner.The generalization of this theory to octonion is not possible because of the non associative nature of octonions.Secondly octonions can not be written directly in terms of eight dimensional matrix representation of real numbers like quaternions are written in terms four dimensional representation of real numbers. There is the difference between quaternion and octonions that the quaternion satisfies all the property of matrices while the octonions are not and the alternativity property of split octonions is still not competant to resolve these inconsistencies associated with octonions. So, it is hard to write the super symmetric extension and we will have to write it another way to visualize the supersymmetry with octonions and octonion gauge theory of dyons.thus we may conclude that many of the properties of quaternion quantum mechanics lead to the properties of supersymmetric quantum mechanics because in both the cases the energy is positive semi definite and a gauge interaction arises automatically when one defines the quaternion units in terms of Pauli spin matrices and supersymmetric charges are defined accordingly. If we describe the well known N = 4 supersymmetry, the 4-dimensional real anti symmetric matrices αjand βJ for all (j = 1,2,3) associated with it [\cite=key-26]satisfy the algebra given by

[formula]

which is the algebra of quaternions. The matrices αj and βJare thus the quaternion analogue for give [formula] real matrix representation of three quaternion units since the properties of αj and βJ are same as those for three non abelian quaternion units. Thus we conclude that N=4 real Super symmetry can be visualized as N=1 quaternion and N=2 complex Super symmetry and the theories of monopoles and dyons are thus be understood better in terms of hyper complex number system.
