Unique ergodicity of free shifts and some other automorphisms of C*-algebras

Introduction

Let Ω be a compact Hausdorff space and T a homeomorphism of Ω onto itself. In the terminology of [\cite=Ox], (see also [\cite=KB] and [\cite=Fu], where slightly different terminology is used), T is called uniquely ergodic if there is a unique T-invariant Borel probability measure μ on Ω, (with respect to which T is then necessarily ergodic). Oxtoby shows [\cite=Ox] that if T is uniquely ergodic, then the ergodic averages

[formula]

converge uniformly to the constant [formula], as n  →    ∞  .

The homeomorphisms of Ω are in 1-1 correspondence with the automorphisms of the C*-algebra C(Ω) of all continuous, complex-valued functions on Ω and the Borel probability measures on Ω are by Riesz's Theorem in 1-1 correspondence with the states of C(Ω). There is a natural noncommutative version of unique ergodicity. Let A be a unital C*-algebra and let α be an automorphism of A. An α-invariant state of A always exists, and can be found, for example, by taking a weak limit of averages

[formula]

of any state φ. We say α is uniquely ergodic if there is a unique α-invariant state of A. It is not difficult to show (based on Oxtoby's argument [\cite=Ox]) that α is uniquely ergodic if and only if for every a∈A the ergodic averages

[formula]

converge in norm to a scalar multiple of the identity as n  →    ∞   and, in this case, the invariant state evaluated at a is equal to this limit. (A more general result is proved in Theorem [\ref=thm:ue] below.)

Our interest in these topics grew out of a question asked by David Kerr [\cite=K]: Is the free shift on [formula] uniquely ergodic? A positive answer to Kerr's question follows from Haagerup's inequality [\cite=haag]. This argument is described in section [\ref=sec:CFinf] below.

In considering more general free shift automorphisms, we were motivated to consider a broader notion of unique ergodicity. If A is a unital C*-algebra and α an automorphism of A, consider the fixed-point subalgebra

[formula]

We say that α is uniquely ergodic relative to its fixed-point subalgebra if every state of Aα has a unique α-invariant state extension to A. In the case when Aα consists only of scalar multiples of the identity element, this reduces to the usual notion of unique ergodicity. In section [\ref=sec:ue], we give some alternative characterizations of unique ergodicity relative to the fixed-point subalgebra. It turns out to be equivalent to norm convergence of the ergodic averages [\eqref=eq:ergodicaves] as n  →    ∞   for all a∈A. Thus, unique ergodicity relative to the fixed-point subalgebra implies (by taking the limit of the ergodic averages) existence of a unique α-invariant conditional expectation from A onto Aα. However (see Question [\ref=qn]) we do not know whether the converse direction holds.

After seeing that the free shift on [formula] is uniquely ergodic, it is natural to ask whether free shifts on other reduced free product C*-algebras and even on reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras are uniquely ergodic relative to their fixed point subalgebras. We give an affirmative answer in Theorem [\ref=thm:afp].

A technical result that we use is an extension of Haagerup's inequality to the setting of reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras. Haagerup's inequality says that the operator norm of an element of [formula] that is supported on words of length n is no greater than n + 1 times the [formula]-norm. It is a fundamental inequality, and has been generalized in several different directions; see, for example, [\cite=dlH], [\cite=J], [\cite=DHR], [\cite=KS], [\cite=RX]. One such generalization is [\cite=DHR], in the context of reduced free product C*-algebras with amalgamation over the scalars, which applies to all finite linear combinations of words of fixed block length n. A strong generalization, due to Ricard and Xu [\cite=RX], is in the context of reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras; they prove bounds on operator norms that apply to all matrices over all finite linear combinations of words of fixed block length n. In Proposition [\ref=prop:ineq], we prove a generalization of Haagerup's inequality in the setting of reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras. Our bound on the operator norm applies only to certain linear combinations of words of block length n, but our bound has a rather nice form. In fact, as Eric Ricard kindly showed us, our Proposition [\ref=prop:ineq] follows from the results of Ricard and Xu. However, we nonetheless present our direct proof here, as it is slightly simpler (for being a more specific result).

To summarize the contents: section [\ref=sec:CFinf] contains the proof of unique ergodicity of the free shift on [formula]; section [\ref=sec:ue] gives alternative characterizations of unique ergodicity relative to the fixed-point subalgebra, and contains a generalization of the argument from the previous section to groups with property (RD) of Jolissaint; section [\ref=sec:constr] recalls the construction of the reduced amalgamated free product of C*-algebras; section [\ref=sec:normest] contains a generalization of Haagerup's inequality to reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras; section [\ref=sec:freeshift] proves that free shifts are uniquely ergodic relative to their fixed-point subalgebras.

The free shift on [formula] is uniquely ergodic

Here, [formula] is the reduced group C*-algebra of the free group on infinitely many generators [formula] and the free shift is the automorphism α of [formula] arising from the automorphism of the group that sends gi to gi + 1.

The C*-algebra [formula] is densely spanned by the left translation operators λh acting on [formula], ([formula]). If h = e is the trivial group element, then λh is the identity element 1 and

[formula]

for all n. If h is a nontrivial element of word length p, then by Haagerup's inequality [\cite=haag],

[formula]

where [formula] refers to the norm of the corresponding element in [formula]. We conclude that the averages appearing on the left-hand-side of [\eqref=eq:haagineq] tend to zero as n  →    ∞  , and this proves that the free shift is uniquely ergodic and that its unique invariant state is the canonical tracial state τ defined by

[formula]

Unique ergodicity relative to the fixed-point subalgebra

In this section, we prove certain conditions equivalent to unique ergodicity relative to the fixed-point subalgebra.

Recall that a conditional expectation from a C*-algebra A onto a C*-subalgebra B is a projection E of norm 1 from A onto B. A classical result of Tomiyama [\cite=Tom] is that such a projection E is automatically completely positive and satisfies the conditional expectation property.

Let α be an automorphism of a unital C*-algebra A and let Aα be its fixed-point subalgebra as in [\eqref=eq:fps]. Then the following five statements are equivalent:

Every bounded linear functional on Aα has a unique bounded, α-invariant linear extension to A.

Every state of Aα has a unique α-invariant state extension to A.

The subspace Aα  +  {a - α(a)|a∈A} is dense in A.

For all a∈A, the sequence of ergodic averages

[formula]

converges in norm as n  →    ∞  .

We have

[formula]

where the closure is with respect to the norm topology.

These five statements imply the following statement:

There exists a unique α-invariant conditional expectation E from A onto Aα.

Furthermore, if (i)-(v) hold, then the conditional expectation E in (vi) is given by the formula

[formula]

(i)[formula](ii) is clear.

(ii)[formula](iii): Suppose, to obtain a contradiction, that (ii) holds but x∈A and

[formula]

By the Hahn-Banach Theorem, there is a bounded linear functional [formula] such that [formula], φ(Aα) = {0} and [formula]. Taking the real and imaginary parts, we may without loss of generality assume that φ is self-adjoint. Let φ  =  φ+  -  φ- be the Jordan decomposition of φ. Then φ+ and φ- are α-invariant, by Observation [\ref=obs:Jordan]. Moreover, φ+ and φ- agree on Aα. Either both restrict to zero on Aα, in which case φ±(1) = 0 and φ± = 0, or φ± are nonzero multiples of states on A and by statement (ii), φ+ and φ- must agree on all of A. This contradicts [formula].

(iii)[formula](iv): Let a∈A and ε > 0. Let c∈Aα and b∈A be such that

[formula]

If n  ≥  m, then

[formula]

Taking m large enough, the upper bound [\eqref=eq:3eps] can be made < 3ε. This shows that the sequence of ergodic averages [\eqref=eq:ergaves] is Cauchy.

(iv)[formula](vi)+  [\eqref=eq:E]: Let E be defined by the formula [\eqref=eq:E]. Clearly, E restricts to the identity map on Aα. One easily shows [formula] and [formula]. So E is an α-invariant conditional expectation from A onto Aα. If E':A  →  Aα is any α-invariant conditional expectation onto Aα, then

[formula]

Taking the limit as n  →    ∞   gives

[formula]

(iv)+  (vi)+  [\eqref=eq:E][formula](i): Let [formula] be a bounded linear functional. Then [formula] is an α-invariant extension of τ to A. To show uniqueness, suppose [formula] is any bounded, α-invariant, linear extension of τ. Then

[formula]

Taking the limit as n  →    ∞   gives

[formula]

so [formula].

We have now proved the equivalence of (i)-(iv), and that these imply (vi) and [\eqref=eq:E].

(i)+  (vi)[formula](v): Since A = Aα  +   ker E, it will suffice to show

[formula]

Suppose, to obtain a contradiction, x∈ ker E but [formula]. By the Hahn-Banach Theorem, there is a bounded linear functional [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. By (i), we must have [formula], so φ(x) = 0, a contradiction.

(v)[formula](iii) is clear.

It was kindly pointed out to us by Thierry Fack that the argument used in section [\ref=sec:CFinf] applies more generally. Indeed, as the following proposition shows, the argument carries over to groups with property (RD), as defined by Jolissaint in [\cite=J]. Note that by [\cite=dlH] this includes the case of Gromov's hyperbolic groups.

Let G be a group with property (RD) for a length function L and let β be an L-preserving automorphism of G such that all orbits of β are either singletons or infinite. Let H = {h∈G|β(h) = h}. Then the automorphism α induced by β on C*r(G) is uniquely ergodic relative to its fixed-point subalgebra, which is the canonical copy of C*r(H) in C*r(G).

If g∈G is such that β(g)  ≠  g, then by [\cite=J] there exist positive numbers C and s such that

[formula]

and this upper bound approaches zero as n goes to ∞  . If β(g) = g, then

[formula]

for all n. Now one easily sees that condition (iv) of Theorem [\ref=thm:ue] holds and that C*r(H) is the fixed-point subalgebra for α.

The construction of reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras

In this section we will review in some detail and thereby set some notation for the reduced amalgamated free product of C*-algebras, which was invented by Voiculescu [\cite=voic].

We first set some notation concerning a right Hilbert C*-module E over a C*-algebra B (see [\cite=la] for a general reference on Hilbert C*-modules). If x∈E, then we let

[formula]

and the norm of x is defined by

[formula]

Let B be a unital C*-algebra, let I be a set with at least two elements and for every i∈I let Ai be a unital C*-algebra containing a copy of B as a unital C*-subalgebra and having a conditional expectation φi:Ai  →  B such that for each ai∈Ai there exists x∈Ai for which φi(x*a*iaix)  ≠  0. We denote by Ei = L2(Ai,φi) the right Hilbert C*-module over B obtained by separation and completion of Ai with respect to the inner product 〈x,y〉  =  φi(x*y). For ai∈Ai, we denote by âi the image of ai in Ei under the canonical map. There is a faithful *  -representation πi of Ai on Ei by adjointable operators given by

[formula]

for x,y∈Ai. We will often omit the reference to πi and write simply av to denote πi(a)(v), for a∈Ai and v∈Ei.

This inclusion B  ⊆  Ai yields a copy of B as a complemented Hilbert C*-submodule of Ei, and we write [formula] and let [formula] be the orthogonal projection onto [formula]. So, for example, we have

[formula]

Since πi(b) sends [formula] into [formula] whenever b∈B, we regard [formula] as equipped with a left B-action via πi. We consider the right Hilbert B-module

[formula]

where the tensor products are with respect to the right Hilbert B-module structures and the left actions of B described above, and where the summand B in [\eqref=eq:Esum] denotes the C*-algebra B with its usual Hilbert C*-module structure over itself. There is a faithful *  -representation of Ai by adjointable operators on E, which is denoted by a  ↦  λia and which can be defined by

[formula]

and, considering a simple tensor

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] and ij  ≠  ij + 1 for all [formula], by

[formula]

Note that for b∈B, λib is the same for all i. We will write λa or simply a instead of λia, when no confusion will result.

The reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebra

[formula]

consists of the C*-algebra A generated in L(E) by the set {λia:a∈Ai, i∈I} and the conditional expectation φ:A  →  B defined by

[formula]

Thus, the C*-algebra A is the closed span of B together with the set of all words of the form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and k(i)  ≠  k(i + 1) for all [formula].

Some norm estimates in reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras

The main result of this section is the following norm estimate, which applies to certain linear combinations of words of length n in reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebras. It is a version of the Haagerup inequality.

Suppose [formula] and consider

[formula]

where K is a finite subset of In such that for all [formula] we have k(i)  ≠  k(i + 1) for all [formula] and where [formula] for all k∈K and [formula]. Suppose, furthermore, that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Before we get to the proof, we consider some preliminary constructions and results. Let us define some elementary adjointable operators on E, in terms of which we will later describe the action of a word w as in [\eqref=eq:w] on a tensor [formula] in [\eqref=eq:xtdtx].

Let P0 denote the orthogonal projection of E onto the summand B  ⊆  E and for [formula] let Pm denote the orthogonal projection of E onto

[formula]

For k∈I, let Qk denote the orthogonal projection of E onto

[formula]

Note that Qk and Pm commute.

Given k∈I and [formula], let ψ(y) = ψk(y)∈L(E) be given by

[formula]

and, for [formula] as in [\eqref=eq:xtdtx],

[formula]

Therefore, we have

For k∈I and a∈Ak, we let ρ(a) = ρk(a)∈L(E) be defined by

[formula]

and, for [formula] as in [\eqref=eq:xtdtx],

[formula]

(Recall that [formula] is the orthogonal projection.) Therefore, we have

To ease notation, for a∈Ak we let

[formula]

The following lemma describes how a word [formula] as in [\eqref=eq:w] can act on a tensor [formula] as in [\eqref=eq:xtdtx]. What can happen is: w can first devour some initial string [formula] of the tensor. Then it can either push some more stuff onto the tensor from the left, or it can instead act on the next letter xq + 1 and then push some more stuff onto the tensor from the left. This is all that can happen, because neighboring letters in w and neighboring xj in [formula] are constrained to come from different [formula], respectively different [formula]. It's not too difficult to see this by considering some examples. We give a more precise statement and a rigorous proof below.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be such that k(i)  ≠  k(i + 1) for all [formula]. Let [formula], where [formula] for all [formula]. Let [formula] be integers.

If r > m + n or r < |m - n|, then PrwPm = 0.

If r = m + n - 2s with [formula], then

[formula]

If r = m + n - 2s + 1 with [formula], then

[formula]

The following equation is equivalent to parts (i)-(iii) of the Lemma taken together:

[formula]

We will prove [\eqref=eq:bigsum] by induction on n. For n = 1, taking first [formula] and using the fact that φk(1)(a1) = 0 together with [\eqref=eq:lambdaaixtx], [\eqref=eq:psiyxtx], [\eqref=eq:psiy*xtx], and [\eqref=eq:rhoaxtx], we find

[formula]

while in the case m = 0, using [\eqref=eq:lambdaaib], [\eqref=eq:psiyb], [\eqref=eq:psiy*b], and [\eqref=eq:rhoab], we find

[formula]

Thus, [\eqref=eq:bigsum] is proved in the case n = 1.

Now let [formula] and set [formula]. By the induction hypothesis, we have

[formula]

Now we multiply both sides of [\eqref=eq:w'sum1] and [\eqref=eq:w'sum2] on the left by a1, and use [\eqref=eq:Pa1P] and [\eqref=eq:a1P0], as needed. For example, from [\eqref=eq:w'sum1] consider

[formula]

If s < n - 1, then the initial part of [\eqref=eq:a1Pstuff] is

[formula]

where we have used If s = n - 1 < m, then the initial part of [\eqref=eq:a1Pstuff] is

[formula]

while if s = n - 1 = m, then the initial part of [\eqref=eq:a1Pstuff] is

[formula]

Turning now to [\eqref=eq:w'sum2], we consider

[formula]

We find that the initial part of [\eqref=eq:a1Pstuff2] is

[formula]

Taking all of these cases into account, we prove [\eqref=eq:bigsum].

Let f be as in Proposition [\ref=prop:ineq]. Let m,r be nonnegative integers. Then

[formula]

If r < |m - n| or r > m + n, then by Lemma [\ref=lem:PwP](i), we have PrfPm = 0.

Case I. Suppose r = m + n - 2s for [formula] and with s < n. By Lemma [\ref=lem:PwP](ii), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

By the hypothesis [\eqref=eq:knek'], if k  ≠  k', then k(1)  ≠  k'(1) and, consequently,

[formula]

Therefore, using also [\eqref=eq:psiynorm], we get

[formula]

Case II. Suppose r = m + n - 2s for s = n  ≤  m. Then [\eqref=eq:PrfPm] becomes

[formula]

and we have

[formula]

Again, by the hypothesis [\eqref=eq:knek'], if k  ≠  k', then k(n)  ≠  k'(n) and, consequently,

[formula]

Using again [\eqref=eq:psiynorm], we get [\eqref=eq:PfPnm1] also in this case.

Case III. Suppose r = m + n - 2s + 1 for [formula]. Then using Lemma [\ref=lem:PwP](iii) and proceeding similarly to above, we obtain the estimate

[formula]

Let [formula] be a faithful *  -representation of B on a Hilbert space [formula]. Then the internal tensor product [formula] is a Hilbert space and the *  -representation [formula] given by [formula] is faithful.

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where we used Lemma [\ref=lem:PwP](i) to get [\eqref=eq:Prf1], Lemma [\ref=lem:PrfPm] to get [\eqref=eq:Prf3] and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to get [\eqref=eq:Prf4]. From [\eqref=eq:Prfv] and [\eqref=eq:Prf1]-[\eqref=eq:Prf5], we get

[formula]

This shows [formula], which implies [\eqref=eq:fnm].

Free shifts

Let D be a unital C*-algebra, and let EDB:D  →  B be a conditional expectation onto a unital C*-subalgebra B. For each integer [formula] let (Ai,φi) be a copy of (D,EDB). Let

[formula]

be the reduced amalgamated free product, and let a  ↦  λia denote the embedding of Ai in the free product algebra A arising from the free product construction, as descibed in section [\ref=sec:constr]. The free-shift automophism α on A is the automorphism of A given by α(λia) = λi + 1a for all a∈A and [formula].

Let α be the free-shift automorphism on the amalgamated free product C*-algebra A as given in [\eqref=eq:Aphi] above. Then B is the fixed-point subalgebra for α and α is uniquely ergodic relative to its fixed-point subalgebra.

We will show

[formula]

for every a∈A. This will imply that B is the fixed-point subalgebra for α and that condition (iv) of Theorem [\ref=thm:ue] holds.

It will suffice to show [\eqref=eq:ergavephi] for all a∈B and words a of the form [formula] for some [formula] and [formula], and some [formula] with k(i)  ≠  k(i + 1), [formula]. Since B is α invariant, [\eqref=eq:ergavephi] is clear for a∈B. So assume a = w as above. Then φ(w) = 0 and [formula] is a finite linear combination of words of length p to which Proposition [\ref=prop:ineq] applies, and we have

[formula]

Thus, we get

[formula]

as required.
