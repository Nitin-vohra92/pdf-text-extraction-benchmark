THE LENSE-THIRRING EFFECT AND THE PIONEER ANOMALY: SOLAR SYSTEM TESTS

The Lense-Thirring effect

Up to now the Lense-Thirring effect[\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] has been only tested in the terrestrial gravitational field with the LAGEOS satellites[\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10]. Although the relativistic predictions are not in disagreement with the results of such tests, their realistic accuracy has always been controversial[\cite=8] [\cite=11] [\cite=12] [\cite=13]. Recent advances in planetary ephemerides14 have made meaningful to compare the relativistic predictions for the Lense-Thirring effect of the Sun on the inner planets of the Solar System[\cite=15] [\cite=16] to the least-squares determined extra-rates of perihelion of such celestial bodies14. There is no contradiction between them; although the errors are still large so that also a zero-effect cannot be ruled out, the hypothesis of the existence of the solar gravitomagnetic field is in better agreement with the data16. In April 2004 the GP-B spacecraft[\cite=17] [\cite=18] has been launched to measure the Schiff precession19 of the spins of four superconducting gyroscopes carried onboard: the expected accuracy is ≈  1%. The space environment of Mars has recently yielded the opportunity of performing another test20 of the Lense-Thirring effect. Almost six years of range and range-rate data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) orbiter, together with three years of data from Odyssey, have been used in order to precisely determine many global properties of Mars21. As a by-product, also the orbit of MGS has been very accurately reconstructed21. The average of the RMS overlap differences of the out-of-plane part of the MGS orbit amounts to 1.613 m over an about 5-years time span (14 November 1999-14 January 2005). Neither the gravitomagnetic force was included in the dynamical models used in the data reduction, nor any empirical out-of-plane acceleration was fitted, so that the RMS overlap differences entirely account for the martian gravitomagnetic force. The average out-of-plane MGS Lense-Thirring shift over the same time span amounts just to 1.610 m: a discrepancy of 0.2%. The error has been evaluated as20 0.5%. Let us, finally, note that the MGS test is based on a data analysis done in a completely independent way with respect to the author of Ref. 20, without having gravitomagnetism in mind at all.

The Pioneer anomaly

The Pioneer anomaly[\cite=22] [\cite=23] [\cite=24] is an unexpected, almost constant and uniform extra-acceleration APio directed towards the Sun of (8.74  ±  1.33)  ×  10- 10 m s- 2 detected in the data of both the Pioneer 10/11 probes after 20 AU. It has attracted much interest because of the possibility that it is a signal of some failure in the currently known laws of gravitation25,26. If the Pioneer anomaly was of gravitational origin, it should then fulfil the equivalence principle and an extra-gravitational acceleration like APio should also affect the motion of any other object moving in the region in which the Pioneer anomaly manifested itself. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are ideal candidates to perform independent and clean tests of the hypothesis that the Pioneer anomaly is due to some still unexplained features of gravity. Indeed, their paths lie at the edge of the Pioneer anomaly region or entirely reside in it because their semimajor axes are 19.19 AU, 30.06 AU, and 39.48 AU, respectively, and their eccentricities amount to 0.047, 0.008 and 0.248. Under the action of APio, whatever physical mechanism may cause it, their perihelia would secularly precess at unexpectedly large rates. For Uranus, which is the only outer planet having completed a full orbital revolution over the time span for which modern observations are available, the anomalous perihelion rate is - 83.58  ±  12.71 arcseconds per century. E.V. Pitjeva in processing almost one century of data with the EPM2004 ephemerides27 also determined extra-rates of the perihelia of the inner14 and outer28 planets as fit-for parameters of global solutions in which she contrasted, in a least-square way, the observations to their predicted values computed with a complete suite of dynamical force models including all the known features of motion. Thus, any unmodelled force as APio is entirely accounted for by the perihelia extra-rates. For the perihelion of Uranus she preliminarily determined an extra-rate of + 0.57  ±  1.30 arcseconds per century. The quoted uncertainty is just the mere formal, statistical error: the realistic one might be up to 10 - 30 times larger. Even if it was 50 times larger, the presence of an unexpected precession as large as that predicted for Uranus would be ruled out. It is unlikely that such a conclusion will be substantially changed when further and extensive re-analysis29,30 of the entire Pioneer 10/11 data set will be carried out since they will be focussed on what happened well before 20 AU. This result is consistent with the findings of Ref. 31 in which the time-dependent patterns of α cos δ and δ induced by a Pioneer-like acceleration on Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have been compared with the observational residuals determined by Pitjeva27 for the same quantities and the same planets over a time span of about 90 years from 1913 (1914 for Pluto) to 2003. While the former ones exhibited well defined polynomial signatures of hundreds of arcseconds, the residuals did not show any particular patterns, being almost uniform strips constrained well within ±  5 arcseconds over the data set time span which includes the entire Pioneer 10/11 lifetimes.
