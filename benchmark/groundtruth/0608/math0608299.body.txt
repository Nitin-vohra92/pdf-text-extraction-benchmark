Introduction

Hardy inequalities play an important role in analysis. The classical one states that for u∈H10(0,  ∞  )

[formula]

The standard Hardy inequality (away from a point) for functions [formula] reads for d  ≥  3

[formula]

There are many other inequalities which also are called Hardy inequalities, see for instance the survey paper by E.B. Davies [\cite=D1] and the books of V.G. Maz'ya [\cite=M] and Kufner and Opic [\cite=KO].

In the present paper we shall investigate a kind of Hardy inequalities which might be called many-particle Hardy inequalities. They can be related to some Schrödinger operators and have some interesting geometrical aspects.

Pick N a positive integer and consider N particles. This means we consider [formula], where [formula] with [formula]. We define rij by We will write sometimes [formula] so that [formula]. Similarily we write sometimes [formula] for the gradient associated to the i-th particle.

We have three groups of results. The first one deals with the "standard" Hardy inequality for many particles saying that

[formula]

In Sections [\ref=4.1]-[\ref=d=1] we prove that this inequality holds for [formula], [formula] with a constant C(d,N), such that c1N- 1  ≤  C(d,N)  ≤  c2N- 1, where c1,c2 > 0. The Hardy inequality [\eqref=sthardy] also holds for one-dimensional particles. In this case the function u is assumed to be equal to zero on diagonals xi = xj. We find in this case that C(1,N) = 1 / 2 and that this constant is sharp.

In section [\ref=magnetic] we consider the two-dimensional case and obtain a version of the Hardy inequality for magnetic multi-particle Dirichlet forms with Aharonov-Bohm type vector potentials attached to every particle. Let [formula], [formula], and let

[formula]

where [formula]. Then we shall prove that

[formula]

The explicit value for the constant DN,α depends on the "degree of rationality " of the magnetic flux α.

Our third result concerns the inequality [\eqref=sthardy] for fermions, i.e. the anti-symmetric functions in [formula]. It turned out that in this case the Hardy inequality [\eqref=sthardy] holds true in all dimensions and if [formula], then

[formula]

see Section [\ref=fermions].

Main results

Hardy inequalities for d-dimenional particles with d  ≥  3

Assume that d  ≥  3, N  ≥  2 and let [formula]. Let us define

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Hardy inequalities of this type cannot hold for general functions [formula], d = 1,2.

For large values of N and [formula] the maximum in [\eqref=C+] is given by the second term.

There is a very simple way of obtaining Hardy inequalities like above with a substantially weaker constant. Starting from [\eqref=SHardy] and noting that for any fixed [formula], [formula],

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

in the quadratic form sense. Adding this up we would get in the sense of quadratic forms and this is weaker than [\eqref=C+] by a factor of more than two for large N and d = 3.

The bounds for C(d,N) are not sharp. Actually for the lower bound we use only the information from the derivation for the 3-particle case, i.e. N = 3. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, though it is not clear how to get explicit better bounds. It is unclear what the optimal distribution of {xj} is as N  →    ∞  . Let R(x,y,z) be the circumradius of the triangle with vertices x,y,z and suppose that the best asymptotic configuration of points could be described by a probability measure μ on [formula]. Let Then applying [\eqref=divmain], see below, one can obtain a much better estimate of the constant C(d,N) for large N given by the inequality

[formula]

Note that the integral

[formula]

is known as Menger-Melnikov curvature of the measure μ, see [\cite=MMV], [\cite=Tol]. Finding the value of K is an interesting open problem.

The next theorem shows that the estimate C(d,N)  =  O(N- 1), as N  →    ∞  , cannot be improved.

Let [formula], [formula], and define and Then

[formula]

For numerical upper bounds see [\eqref=C<] and also Remark [\ref=><].

For any N and d  ≥  3 there is a constant C' = C'(d,N) such that the operator in [formula]

[formula]

is not bounded from below and such that

[formula]

with some c(d) > 0.

Corollary [\ref=Unb] could be obtained by explicit calculation, see [\eqref=Tphi] and [\eqref=rijphi]. Indeed, it follows from Theorem [\ref=C<<] that there is a function, [formula] and a constant c such that

[formula]

Since both -  Δ and the potential term show the same scaling, then if we replace φ(x) by φ(λx) and normalize we can make the expression in [\eqref=phi-b] as negative as we want.

Hardy inequality for 1D particles

Let Suppose that [formula] then

[formula]

The constant 1 / 2 is sharp.

One can get easily an inequality like [\eqref=1dN] with an N-dependent constant instead of 1 / 2 by using [\eqref=H1]. First note that [\eqref=H1] can be rewritten such that for any [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

Now consider N = 2 and note that [\eqref=1dHy] implies for [formula] for i = 1,2 so that adding up we get [formula]. If we would continue like this we would get instead of the 1 / 2 in [\eqref=1dN], [formula] as in [\eqref=Drij] of Remark [\ref=r2], a much weaker bound tending to zero for N  →    ∞  .

Magnetic Hardy inequalities in 2D

Let the vector field [formula] be defined by [\eqref=ABfield] and let

[formula]

The following magnetic Hardy inequality for two-dimensional particles holds true

This inequality could be considered as a version of a 2D Hardy inequality by Laptev-Weidl [\cite=LW] for Aharonov-Bohm magnetic Dirichlet forms and its generalisation obtained by A. Balinsky [\cite=Bal].

Hardy inequalities for fermions

Let us consider anti-symmetric functions u(x), [formula], [formula], such that

[formula]

for all pairs (i,j),  i  ≠  j.

For any [formula], and anti-symmetric function [formula] we have

[formula]

The latter inequality could be improved for large N. By using arguments from [\cite=LThirring] and [\cite=LYau] we expect that for large N the N dependence of the constant in [\eqref=FermHardy] could be improved to N- 1 / 3.

It has recently been shown in [\cite=FHLS] that there is a constant Cd such that C(d,N)  ≥  Cd  N- 1 / 3.

Some auxiliary results

In this section we consider several simple results of analytical and geometrical character and start with a simple but crucial inequality.

Let [formula] and let be a vectorfield in [formula] whose components and their first derivatives are uniformly bounded in [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof. We use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and partial integration. Indeed,

[formula]

Squaring this inequality completes the proof.  [formula]

The standard Hardy inequality (away from a point), [\eqref=SHardy] for m  ≥  3 can be obtained by choosing We pick [formula] and insert [formula] into [\eqref=I] and obtain so that [formula] is dense in [formula] and therefore ε  →  0 gives [\eqref=SHardy].

The next lemma is related to the so-called Melnikov-Menger curvature and could be found, for example, in [\cite=Tol].

Define for three points [formula], Let Rijk be the circumradius of the triangle with corners xi,xj,xk. Then

Proof. Let a = xi - xj and b = xi - xk. Then

[formula]

Here φ is the angle between a and b. The relation between the circumradius and the angle follws from the sine-theorem. Clearly if [formula] and not all of them equal, Rijk  =    ∞  .  [formula]

The next statements are concerned with two inequalities for triangles, see also [\cite=Mitr].

Let R be the circumradius of a triangle with sides with side lenghts a,b,c then

[formula]

Both inequalities are equalities for the equilateral triangle.

Proof. This is an easy consequence of the sine-theorem and a Lagrange multiplyer argument. Indeed notice that [formula] where the angles α,β,γ correspond to the angle at the corner opposite to the sides with side lengths a respectively b,c. We show the first inequality. This reads

[formula]

It hence suffices to show that for α  +  β  +  γ  =  π, sin 2α  +   sin 2β  +   sin 2γ  ≤  9 / 4. So we look at Differentiation leads to and this implies that There are three solutions, namely α  =  β  =  γ, α  =  β  =  π / 2,  γ = 0 and finally α  =  π,  β  =  γ = 0. If we insert the values into [\eqref=9R2] we get the desired result.

For the other inequality we have to show that and this can be seen by multiplication which yields

[formula]

since a2 / b2 + b2 / a2  ≥  2 and similarily for the other fractions above.

[formula]

The following two statements can be checked by straight forward computations.

Let [formula], j = 1,2,3. Then

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula]. Then

Finally we need a statement which could be considered as two versions of Hardy's inequalities for three particles.

Let [formula], d  ≥  2, and let Then

[formula]

Furthermore if R(x) is the circumradius of the triangle with vertices x1,x2,x3, then

[formula]

Proof. This follows from a simple direct calculation. Let F  =  G in [\eqref=I], where

[formula]

Then by applying Lemma [\ref=div] we easily work out by using the identity given in Lemma [\ref=MM], that and We insert these equalities into [\eqref=I] and obtain [\eqref=Hrh]. To be more precise we first consider [formula] where the denominator in [\eqref=Grho] is replaced by ρ2  +  ε2. Then as in the proof of the standard Hardy-inequality the result follows as ε tends to zero. Finally in order to prove [\eqref=RH] we use the inequality from Lemma [\ref=tri], which tells us that Hence [\eqref=RH] follows immediately from [\eqref=Hrh]. [formula]

For one-dimensional particles the circumradius is equal to infinity and therefore [\eqref=RH] becomes trivial.

However, we do not believe that the constant in [\eqref=RH] is sharp. Perhaps one can find a suitable F so that one can directly obtain a Hardy-type inequality for R- 2.

Proofs of main results.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=d-dimH]

A

Let us first give a simple proof of the inequality [\eqref=dNH] which states that C(d,N)  ≥  (d - 2)2 / N.

For a function [formula] we consider a vector field

[formula]

Then by using arguments from the proof of Lemma [\ref=div] with the vector field F1 we find

[formula]

Moreover, if we introduce the vector field

[formula]

then using Lemma [\ref=div] with F2 we obtain

[formula]

Adding the inequalities [\eqref=jk] and [\eqref=dN] up and using Lemma [\ref=NN] we arrive at

[formula]

The latter inequality implies the inequality C(d,N)  ≥  (d - 2)2 / N and also gives a positive remainder term which is of order O(N).

B

Let us now define

[formula]

where the Fj are given by

[formula]

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=d-dimH] we apply Lemma [\ref=div] for the vector field F3 which is conveniently written as a vector with N elements which themselves are vectors with d entries. The divergence of F3 can be similarily defined as where [formula] div Fi and where the divergence is now with respect to a d-dimensional vector field.

Assume that d  ≥  3 and N  ≥  2. Let for an arbitrary [formula] and where Rijk is as in Lemma [\ref=circum]. Then

[formula]

Proof. The proof is an easy calculation. We just note that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

where we used Lemma [\ref=circum]. We just have to insert these expressions into [\eqref=I] to obtain [\eqref=divmain] proving the proposition.  [formula]

Consider now inequality [\eqref=divmain]. There are two possibilities to obtain from this quadratic inequality a linear inequality

a. First we can try to find an estimate such that and this leads to

[formula]

b. The other possibility is to find an estimate of the form Indeed, with this estimate we get and this leads to the quadratic inequality

[formula]

Therefrom we get by solving the corresponding quadratic equation

[formula]

case a. We show that

[formula]

This is an easy consequence of the inequality [\eqref=trtr] in Lemma [\ref=tri]. Indeed we just have to show [\eqref=casea] that k(d,N)  ≤  N - 2 and this can be seen by counting. Clearly Z(d,N) consists of [formula] and X(d,N) of [formula] terms. Finally we group each three particle coordinates together and apply Lemma [\ref=tri]. This gives [\eqref=C-N] and an alternative proof of the result obtained in subsection A.

case b. This case is more involved. We begin with considering three particles.

Note that for three d-dimensional particles with d  ≥  3, [\eqref=RH] implies so that we obtain for N = 3 in [\eqref=Xsq] We continue with the N-particle case and get by counting from [\eqref=divmain] that From the quadratic inequality [\eqref=Q<] we now infer that This inequality together with [\eqref=C-N] proves [\eqref=C+] and therefore the second part of Theorem [\ref=d-dimH].  [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=C<<].

Let [formula] and consider for fixed N We observe that

[formula]

Next we calculate

[formula]

Substituting the expressions from [\eqref=Tphi] and [\eqref=rijphi] into [\eqref=dNH] we complete the proof.  [formula]

Here we provide a numerical value for the right hand side in [\eqref=Dd] and therefore an estimate from above for the constant C(d,N).

Let us choose

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Straight forward computations give us Substituting all the expressions into [\eqref=Dd] we obtain

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

i.e. 0.43 < C(3,N) < 3.69. For the three particle system using the estimate from below provided by Theorem [\ref=d-dimH] we have

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=C+] that the gap between the lower and upper bounds obtained in Theorem [\ref=d-dimH] and in formula [\eqref=C<] is growing with respect to d.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=1dHar].

The inequality [\eqref=1dN] follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=div] with F defined by [\eqref=F_3], [\eqref=F_3j] and the relations [\eqref=divF_3] and [\eqref=F2_3]. It only remains to observe that by Lemma [\ref=circum] the second sum in [\eqref=F2_3] is equal to zero for d = 1.

Let us now prove that the constant 1 / 2 appearing in [\eqref=1dN] is sharp. It is enough to show that for any ε > 0 there is a function v = vε such that

[formula]

Let α  =  1 / 4  +  δ Then

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Note that by Lemma [\ref=circum]

[formula]

Moreover the identity

[formula]

implies

[formula]

Therefore we obtain from [\eqref=nabla_v]

[formula]

where

[formula]

We conclude the proof by choosing δ small enough so that it satisfies the inequality 1 / 2 + ε  ≥  8(1 / 4 + δ)2(1 + β(δ)).  [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Magn].

We begin with recalling two results obtained in the papers of [\cite=LW] and [\cite=Bal] concerning the Hardy inequalities for Aharonov-Bohm magnetic Dirichlet forms.

a. One particle inequality. Let [formula], [formula] and let [formula] be the Aharonov-Bohm vector potential

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. Indeed, using polar coordinates (r,θ) we have [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

[formula]

b. Magnetic potentials with multiple singularities.

Assume that [formula] are n fixed different points in [formula], zj  =  xj + iyj and [formula]. Let [formula] the following vector potential

[formula]

This corresponds to Aharonov-Bohm magnetic vector fields placed in n points zj with magnetic fluxes αj. Let now [formula] be an analytic function with zero set [formula] and such that Φ(  ∞  ) =   ∞  .

Let [formula] be the zero set of Φz' and let [formula] be such that [formula]. Denote by A the pre-image of these points under the map [formula]. For an arbitrary point [formula] we define a curve γz obtained by |Φ|- 1(|Φ(z)|). Let [formula] be a bounded domain defined by γz. We now consider a piecewise constant function

[formula]

The following Hardy inequality holds true

[formula]

For the proof see [\cite=Bal].

c. Multi-particle case. Let now [formula], zj = xj1  +  ixj2 and let [formula], [formula]. Then according Balinsky's lemma there are piecewise constants functions CΦj(x) defined by [\eqref=C_Phi], such that

[formula]

A simple computation shows

[formula]

Note that CΦj(x)  ≥  DN,α, where DN,α is defined by [\eqref=D_N]. Therefore we obtain

[formula]

We complete the proof by noticing that

[formula]

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Ferm].

Let us begin with a simple observation concerning odd functions in [formula] which has been pointed out already in the classical paper of M.S. Birman [\cite=Bir].

Let [formula], d  ≥  2. Then

Proof. Let us introduce spherical coordinates x  =  (r,θ). Then

[formula]

By using the 1-dimensional Hardy inequality with weight (see for example [\cite=KO]) we obtain

[formula]

It only remains to note that since u is an odd function it is orthogonal to constants on [formula] and therefore

[formula]

where d - 1 is the second eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on [formula].  [formula]

We now consider an anti-symmetric function of two variables [formula].

For any anti-symmetric function [formula] we have

Proof. We make an orthogonal coordinate transformation Thus |x|2 + |y|2 = |s|2 + |t|2 and

[formula]

If we define the function ũ(s,t) as

[formula]

then it is odd with respect to t, ũ(s, - t)  =    -  ũ(s,t). By using Proposition [\ref=odd] we obtain Transforming back to u and noting that |t|- 2 = 2|x - y|- 2 we complete the proof.  [formula]

Let us note (cf. Lemma [\ref=NN]) that for [formula] If û is the Fourier transform of the function u, then by using Lemma [\ref=anti-symm] we find

[formula]

In the latter inequality we can neglect the second integral and this completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=Ferm].  [formula]
