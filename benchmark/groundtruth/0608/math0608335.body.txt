Introduction

Consider a real Hilbert space H and the corresponding symmetric Fock space

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be a rigging of H with the quasinuclear embedding [formula]. Consider a Jacobi field J = ((φ))φ∈H+ in the space F(H). By definition, a Jacobi field is a family of commuting selfadjoint operators which have a three-diagonal structure with respect to the decomposition ([\ref=intro_Fock]). These operators are assumed to linearly and continuously depend on the indexing parameter φ∈H+. The concept of a Jacobi field was studied in [\cite=YuBVLEL95], [\cite=EL95], [\cite=YuB98], [\cite=YuB98IEO], [\cite=YuB98MF], and [\cite=YuB00].

The above-mentioned papers provide the expansion of the Jacobi field J in generalized joint eigenvectors. The corresponding Fourier transform appears to be a unitary operator between the Fock space F(H) and the space L2(H-,dρ). The measure ρ on H- is called the spectral measure of J. Note that the Jacobi field with the Gaussian spectral measure is the classical free field in quantum field theory. The Jacobi field with the Poisson spectral measure was actually discovered in [\cite=RHKP84] and [\cite=DS84].

Jacobi fields are actively utilized in non-Gaussian white noise calculus and the theory of stochastic processes, see [\cite=YuBVLEL95], [\cite=EL95], [\cite=YuB98IEO], [\cite=YuB00], [\cite=YuB00IDA], [\cite=YuKEL00], [\cite=YuC02], [\cite=YuBELDM03], [\cite=YuBDM03], [\cite=EL02], [\cite=ELsubm], [\cite=DM03], [\cite=EL04], and also [\cite=DNWS00] and [\cite=WS00]. Other applications are to the integration of nonlinear difference-differential equations, see [\cite=YuB98]. In the case of a finite-dimensional H, the theory of Jacobi fields is closely related to some results in [\cite=MGAK91], [\cite=MGAK94], and [\cite=CDYX01].

The problem of finding an operator family with a given spectral measure often arises in applications. In some situations, the given measure is equal to the image of the spectral measure of a Jacobi field under a certain mapping. More precisely, let ρ be the spectral measure of the field J. Consider a mapping K+:H-  →  T- with T- being a certain Hilbert space. This mapping takes ρ to the measure ρK on T-. Our paper aims to find a family JK of operators whose spectral measure equals ρK. In other words, we track the changes of the Jacobi field caused by mapping its spectral measure. Noteworthily, if K+ is an invertible operator, then JK appears to be isomorphic to the initial family J.

We also study the chaotic decomposition of the space L2(T-,dρK), which is derived through the orthogonalization of polynomials on T-.

Throughout this paper, we assume K+ to be a bounded operator with [formula]. We will also assume [formula] to be dense in T-. This assumption is not essential because the measure ρK is lumped on [formula], and we can always replace T- with the closure of [formula] in T-.

Preliminaries

Let H be a real separable Hilbert space. The corresponding symmetric Fock space is defined as

[formula]

and consists of sequences Φ = (Φn)∞n = 0, Φn∈Fn(H) = Hnc, (Hc being the complexification of H and [formula] denoting symmetric tensor product). The finite vectors [formula] form a linear topological space Ffin(H)  ⊂  F(H). The convergence in Ffin(H) is equivalent to the uniform finiteness and coordinatewise convergence. The vector [formula] is called vacuum.

Let

[formula]

be a rigging of H with real Hilbert spaces H+ and H- = (H+)' (hereafter, X' denotes the dual of the space X). We suppose the inequality [formula] to hold for the norms. We also suppose the embedding [formula] to be quasinuclear. The pairing in ([\ref=rigging_H]) can be extended naturally to a pairing between Fn(H+) and Fn(H-). The latter can, in turn, be extended to a pairing between Ffin(H+) and (Ffin(H+))'. In what follows, we use the notation 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉H for all of these pairings. Note that (Ffin(H+))' coincides with the direct product of the spaces Fn(H-), [formula].

Definition of a Jacobi field

In the Fock space F(H), consider the family (J(φ))φ∈H+ of operator-valued Jacobi matrices

[formula]

with the entries

[formula]

The inclusions [formula], [formula], and [formula] hold for the domains. We suppose these domains to contain Fn(H+) and Fn + 1(H+), respectively.

Each matrix J(φ) gives rise to a Hermitian operator J(φ) in the space F(H): for [formula] we define

[formula]

Assume the following.

The operators an(φ) and bn(φ), φ∈H+, [formula], take real spaces into real ones.

(smoothness) The restrictions [formula] and [formula] act continuously from Fn(H+) to Fn + 1(H+) and Fn(H+), respectively. The restrictions [formula] act continuously from Fn + 1(H+) to Fn(H+).

The operators J(φ), φ∈H+, are essentially selfadjoint and their closures (φ), φ∈H+, are strong commuting.

The functions

[formula]

are linear and continuous for all Φn∈Fn(H+), Φn + 1∈Fn + 1(H+).

(regularity) The real linear operators [formula] defined by the equalities

[formula]

are continuous. Furthermore, the operators

[formula]

are invertible.

We will call the family J = ((φ))φ∈H+ of operators a (commutative) Jacobi field if conditions (a)-(e) are satisfied. Once again we should emphasize that the operators (φ) act in the Fock space F(H).

Spectral theory of a Jacobi field

It is possible to apply the projection spectral theorem, see [\cite=YuBYuK88] and [\cite=AP03], to the field J = ((φ))φ∈H+. Here, we will only present the result of such an application.

Given a Jacobi field J, there exist a Borel probability measure ρ on the space H- (the spectral measure) and a vector-valued function [formula] such that the following statements hold:

For every ξ∈H-, the vector [formula], is a generalized joint eigenvector of J with eigenvalue ξ, i.e.,

[formula]

After being extended by continuity to the whole of the space F(H), the Fourier transform

[formula]

becomes a unitary operator between F(H) and L2(H-,dρ).

The mapping I takes every operator (φ), φ∈H+, to the operator of multiplication by the function [formula] in the space L2(H-,dρ).

The equality

[formula]

holds true. Indeed, Assertion 3 of Theorem [\ref=thm_pst] implies ([\ref=IV_m=monom]) for the vectors

[formula]

If a sequence (σin)∞i = 0 of such vectors converges to Fn in the space Fn(H+), then

[formula]

in the space L2(H-,dρ). Since [formula] for each ξ∈H-, the above formula implies [formula].

Now we have to recall some additional facts about the Fourier transform I.

Let Pn(H-) denote the set of all continuous polynomials on H- of degree ≤  n:

[formula]

The Fourier transform I takes the set [formula], [formula], to the set Pn(H-)  ⊂  L2(H-,dρ) of continuous polynomials on H- of degree ≤  n, i.e.,

[formula]

The set [formula] of all continuous polynomials on H- is dense in L2(H-,dρ).

If dim H =   ∞  , then [formula] is not closed in F(H) and neither is Pn(H-) closed in L2(H-,dρ). The closure of Pn(H-) in L2(H-,dρ) will be denoted by n(H-). The elements of n(H-) are, by definition, ordinary polynomials on H-. Clearly,

[formula]

The orthogonal decomposition [formula] and the unitarity of I imply the following orthogonal (chaotic) decomposition of the space L2(H-,dρ):

[formula]

Suppose H to be a nuclear space densely and continuously embedded into H. In all the previous constructions, it is possible to use the rigging

[formula]

instead of the rigging ([\ref=rigging_H]). In this case, the family J consists of the operators (φ), φ∈H. The corresponding spectral measure ρ is a Borel probability measure on H'.

Mapping of the spectral measure

Consider a real separable Hilbert space T+ and a rigging

[formula]

As in the case of the rigging ([\ref=rigging_H]), the pairing in ([\ref=rigging_T]) can be extended to a pairing between Fn(T+) and Fn(T-). The latter can, in turn, be extended to a pairing between Ffin(T+) and (Ffin(T+))'. We use the notation 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉T for all of these pairings.

Let K:T+  →  H+ be a linear continuous operator with [formula] and suppose [formula] to be dense in H+. The adjoint of K with respect to ([\ref=rigging_H]) and ([\ref=rigging_T]) is a linear continuous operator K+:H-  →  T- defined by the equality

[formula]

The kernel [formula]. The range [formula] is dense in T-.

Suppose K+ξ = 0 for some ξ∈H-. This means 〈K+ξ,f〉T  =  〈ξ,Kf〉H = 0 for all f∈T+. Since [formula] is dense in H+, the latter implies ξ = 0. Thus [formula].

Next, we introduce a standard unitary [formula] by the formula

[formula]

The equality

[formula]

holds true. If (K+ξ,χ)T- = 0 for any ξ∈H-, then [formula] and χ = 0. Thus [formula] is dense in T-.

Let B(H-) stand for the Borel σ-algebra of the space H-. We denote by ρK the image of the measure ρ under the mapping K+. By definition, ρK is a probability measure on the σ-algebra

[formula]

((K+)- 1(Δ) denoting the preimage of the set Δ). Clearly, the mapping K+ is Borel-measurable, therefore C contains the Borel σ-algebra of the space T-. If K+ takes Borel subsets of H- to the Borel subsets of T-, then C coincides with the Borel σ-algebra of T-.

Main results

Consider a Jacobi field J = ((φ))φ∈H+ in the Fock space F(H). The spectral measure ρ of the field J is defined on H-. The mapping K+ takes ρ to the measure ρK on T-. The main objectives of this section are:

To obtain a family JK = (K(f))f∈T+ of commuting selfadjoint operators operators whose spectral measure is equal to ρK.

To obtain an analogue of the decomposition ([\ref=initial_dec]) for the space L2(T-,dρK).

We note that the family JK proves to satisfy conditions (a)-(d) of a Jacobi field. It is generally unclear whether JK satisfies condition (e).

The assumption [formula] is not essential. Indeed, the measure ρK proves to be lumped on the set of functionals which equal zero on [formula]. This set can be naturally identified with [formula]. Thus we can always replace T+ with [formula].

ρK as the spectral measure

Define the Hilbert space T as the completion of T+ with respect to the scalar product

[formula]

The operator K induces a unitary q:T  →  H. We preserve the notations K and q for the extensions of K and q to the complexified spaces T+ ,c and Tc.

In the Fock space [formula], consider the family (JK(f))f∈T+ of operator-valued Jacobi matrices

[formula]

with the entries

[formula]

(recall that an(φ) and bn(φ) denote the entries of J(φ)). The domains [formula], [formula], and [formula] contain Fn(T+) and Fn + 1(T+), respectively. As in the case of J(φ), each matrix JK(f) gives rise to a Hermitian operator JK(f) in the space F(T). The domain [formula] equals Ffin(T+).

As we will further show, the operators JK(f), f∈T+, are essentially selfadjoint in the space F(T). Their closures K(f) are strongly commuting. Denote JK = (K(f))f∈T+.

Assume the restrictions

[formula]

to take values in [formula] and [formula], respectively. There exists a vector-valued function [formula] such that the following statements hold:

For ρK-almost all ω∈T-, the vector [formula], is a generalized joint eigenvector of the family JK with the eigenvalue ω, i.e.,

[formula]

After being extended by continuity to the whole of the space F(T), the Fourier transform

[formula]

becomes a unitary between F(T) and L2(T-,dρK).

The mapping IK takes every operator K(f), f∈T+, to the operator of multiplication by the function [formula] in the space L2(T-,dρK).

Step 1. First, we have to prove that the operators JK(f), f∈T+, are essentially selfadjoint and their closures are strongly commuting. We define the operator

[formula]

The unitarity of q implies the unitarity of K. A straightforward calculation shows that

[formula]

The operators J(Kf) are essentially selfadjoint and their closures are strongly commuting. Since K is a unitary, the operators JK(f) possess these properties, too.

Step 2. Let us establish an isomorphism between the spaces L2(T-,dρK) and L2(H-,dρ). For a complex-valued function G(ω) on T-, we define the function

[formula]

According to the definition of ρK, the mapping U induces an isometric operator U between the spaces L2(T-,dρK) and L2(H-,dρ).

We have [formula]. Indeed, consider an arbitrary function F(ξ) over H-. Define G(ω) = F((K+)- 1ω) if [formula] and G(ω) = 0 otherwise. The equality

[formula]

holds true. If F∈L2(H-,dρ), then G∈L2(T-,dρK). In this case, the above equality yields (UG)(ξ) = F(ξ).

As a result, we have the unitary U:L2(T-,dρK)  →  L2(H-,dρ).

Step 3. Consider the operator

[formula]

with I and K given by ([\ref=Fourier_J]) and ([\ref=calK_def]), respectively. Since all of its components are unitaries between the corresponding spaces, IK is a unitary itself. Our next goal is to establish representation ([\ref=I_K_defin]) for IK.

Fix a vector [formula]. According to ([\ref=Fourier_J]), the equality

[formula]

holds true. Define [formula]. Note that Q(K+ξ) is well-defined because K+ is monomorphic. Evidently,

[formula]

The application of U- 1 to ([\ref=<KF] [\ref=P>=<F] [\ref=Q>]) yields representation ([\ref=I_K_defin]) for the unitary IK = U- 1IK.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] will be complete if we show that Statements 1 and 3 hold for the function Q(ω).

Step 4. Let us prove Statement 1. As before, we fix a vector [formula]. Due to the assumption on the restrictions ([\ref=assump_restr]), the vector K(f)F belongs to [formula]. Hence the right-hand side of ([\ref=Q_is_eig]) is well-defined.

Formulas ([\ref=gj_eig_def]), ([\ref=J_K=KJ(Kf)K]), and ([\ref=<KF] [\ref=P>=<F] [\ref=Q>]) imply

[formula]

for ρK-almost all ω∈T- (overbars denote complex conjugacy). This proves Statement 1.

Statement 3 is a direct consequence of ([\ref=I_K_defin]) and ([\ref=Q_is_eig]).

While proving the theorem, we showed that the mapping ([\ref=U_definit]) induces a unitary U:L2(T-,dρK)  →  L2(H-,dρ). We also obtained an explicit formula for the Fourier transform IK. Namely,

[formula]

with I and K given by ([\ref=Fourier_J]) and ([\ref=calK_def]), respectively.

As mentioned above, it is generally unclear whether JK satisfies condition (e) in the definition of a Jacobi field. However, if the operator K is invertible, then JK does satisfy (e) and hence is a Jacobi field. This field is isomorphic to the initial field J.

Orthogonal (chaotic) decomposition of the space L2(T-,dρK)

This subsection aims to obtain an analogue of the decomposition ([\ref=initial_dec]) for the space L2(T-,dρK). If JK proves to be a Jacobi field, then Theorem [\ref=IF_n(H)=calP_n] is applicable. Otherwise, an analogue of ([\ref=initial_dec]) for L2(T-,dρK) may be obtained with the help of Theorem [\ref=UQn=Pn].

Further considerations do not require any assumptions on the restrictions ([\ref=assump_restr]). Theorem [\ref=UQn=Pn] below is applicable to a Jacobi field which does not satisfy the assumption of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. In this case, the unitary IK should be defined by formula ([\ref=I_K_expl]).

Let Qn(T-) denote the set of all continuous polynomials

[formula]

on T- of degree ≤  n. As will be shown below, the inclusion

[formula]

holds. The closure of Qn(T-) in L2(T-,dρK) will be denoted by n(T-). The elements of n(T-) are ordinary polynomials on T-.

The unitary IK takes the set [formula], [formula], to the set n(T-)  ⊂  L2(T-,dρK) of ordinary polynomials on T-, i.e.,

[formula]

The set [formula] of all continuous polynomials on T- is dense in L2(T-,dρK).

Step 1. First, we have to prove inclusion ([\ref=Qn_subset_L2]). The application of the mapping ([\ref=U_definit]) to the polynomial ([\ref=pol_on_T]) yields

[formula]

The expression in the right hand side of this formula is a continuous polynomial with the coefficients [formula]. According to Theorem [\ref=IF_n(H)=calP_n], this polynomial belongs to the space L2(H-,dρ). Therefore qn(ω) belongs to the space L2(T-,dρK). The latter proves inclusion ([\ref=Qn_subset_L2]).

Step 2. Let us prove equality ([\ref=I_KsumFn=Qn]). Formula ([\ref=I_K_expl]) and Theorem [\ref=IF_n(H)=calP_n] yield

[formula]

The proof of equality ([\ref=I_KsumFn=Qn]) will be complete if we show that n(H-) = Un(T-), [formula].

As explained above, each function Uqn(ξ) = qn(K+ξ), qn(ω)∈Qn(T-), belongs to Pn(H-). Thus it is only necessary to prove that such functions are dense in n(H-).

Step 3. It suffices to approximate a monomial [formula], am∈Fm(H+), [formula], with the elements of UQn(T-).

Fix ε > 0. Since [formula] is dense in H+, there exists a vector

[formula]

such that

[formula]

Taking equality ([\ref=IV_m=monom]) into account, we conclude that the monomial [formula] satisfies the estimate

[formula]

Thus we have approximated [formula] with the functions [formula].

Step 4. Let us prove the last assertion of Theorem [\ref=UQn=Pn]. Due to the unitarity of IK,

[formula]

(tilde stands for the closure in the corresponding space). Thus Q(T-) is dense in L2(T-,dρK).

We can now construct the ([\ref=initial_dec])-type decomposition for the space L2(T-,dρK):

[formula]

Examples

Let us make some remarks concerning the space T and the Fourier transform of the measure ρK,

[formula]

We will be using these remarks in our further considerations.

Since K:T+  →  H+ is continuous and since the embedding [formula] is continuous, we easily conclude that T+ is continuously embedded into T. Furthermore, T+ is a dense subset of T. Thus we can use T as the zero space in the chain ([\ref=rigging_T]), i.e., we can assume T0 = T.

The set [formula] is dense in H-. Assuming T0 = T, one can prove that the restriction [formula] coincides with the mapping [formula].

Consider the Fourier transform

[formula]

of the measure ρ. By the definition of ρK, we have:

[formula]

Thus the Fourier transform K(f) of the measure ρK satisfies the equality

[formula]

We will now apply the results of Section [\ref=sec_JS] to some classical Jacobi fields.

Suppose J to be the classical free field, see e.g. [\cite=YuBYuK88], [\cite=YuBVLEL95], [\cite=EL95], [\cite=YuB98IEO], and [\cite=YuB98MF]. In this case,

[formula]

Clearly, the assumption of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] on the restrictions [\eqref=assump_restr] is now automatically satisfied for any operator K under consideration.

The spectral measure ρ of the field J is the standard Gaussian measure γ on H-. Its Fourier transform is given by the formula

[formula]

According to Remark [\ref=Fourier_measures], the Fourier transform of ρK is given by the formula

[formula]

(since H+ is a subset of H-, the operator K+K:T+  →  T- is well-defined). This means ρK is the Gaussian measure on T- with the correlation operator K+K. Notice that, in the case where T0 = T, the Fourier transform of ρK may be written down in the form

[formula]

i.e., ρK is the standard Gaussian measure on T-.

Applying Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] to the classical free field J, we obtain the family JK whose spectral measure is ρK.

In what follows, we assume T0 = T.

Let H be [formula] and let H+ and T+ be the Sobolev spaces [formula] and [formula], respectively. Suppose J to be the Poisson field, see e.g. [\cite=EL95], [\cite=YuB98IEO], [\cite=YuB98MF], and [\cite=YuB00IDA]. In this case,

[formula]

Here, b(φ) the operator of multiplication by the function φ(x) in the space H.

The space H- coincides with the negative Sobolev space [formula]. The spectral measure ρ of the field J is equal to the centered Poisson measure π with the intensity dx. The Fourier transform of ρ is given by the formula

[formula]

Suppose K:T+  →  H+ to be the operator of multiplication by the function κ(x) = e- x2. One can easily verify that K is bounded and [formula]. The range [formula] is dense in H+ because it contains all the smooth compactly supported functions. On the other hand, [formula] because e.g. the function ψ(x) = (1 + x2)- 2∈H+ does not belong to [formula]. Clearly, the field J and the operator K satisfy the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

The space T- is the dual of the space [formula] with respect to the zero space [formula]. Evidently, one may realize T- as the dual space of [formula] with respect to the zero space [formula], in which case T- is the usual negative Sobolev space [formula].

According to Remark [\ref=K^+=K^-1], the operator K+:H-  →  T- is equal to the extension by continuity of the mapping

[formula]

According to Remark [\ref=Fourier_measures], the Fourier transform of ρK is given by the formula

[formula]

Applying Theorem [\ref=main_theorem], we obtain the family JK whose spectral measure is ρK.

As before, let H be [formula]. Let H+ and T+ equal [formula] and [formula], respectively. Suppose J to be the Poisson field.

Define the operator K:T+  →  H+ as the extension by continuity of the mapping

[formula]

([formula] stands for the set of all smooth compactly supported functions on [formula]). Evidently, K is bounded and [formula].

The range [formula] is dense in H+.

Fix q∈H+ and assume (Kp(x),q(x))H+ = 0 for an arbitrary [formula]. Our goal is to show that q = 0.

The equality

[formula]

holds. Consider the differential expression

[formula]

Let L+ denote the adjoint expression. Since

[formula]

for an arbitrary [formula], the function q is a generalized solution of the differential equation L+y = 0. Calculating L+ and applying Theorem 6.1 from Chapter 16 of [\cite=YuBGUZSh90], we conclude that q is indeed a classical solution of the equation

[formula]

The general solution of the above equation is

[formula]

Assume y = q∈H+. In this case, the limits

[formula]

must equal 0. Evidently, the latter implies c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. Thus q = 0.

The Poisson field J and the operator K do not satisfy the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. However, Theorem [\ref=UQn=Pn] is applicable now.

The space H- is the negative Sobolev space [formula], while T- may be realized as the dual of the space [formula] with respect to the zero space [formula]. In this case, T- is the usual negative Sobolev space [formula]. According to Remark [\ref=Fourier_measures], the Fourier transform of ρK is given by the formula

[formula]

Applying Theorem [\ref=UQn=Pn], we obtain a ([\ref=initial_dec])-type decomposition for the space L2(T-,dρK).

In a forthcoming paper, we are going to discuss in detail the case of the fractional Brownian motion, which is an important example of a Gaussian measure with a non-trivial correlation operator.
