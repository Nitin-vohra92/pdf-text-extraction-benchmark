The regularized product of the Fibonacci numbers

Using zeta-function regularization, it is possible to calculate, for example, the regularized product over all the positive integers, and over all the primes [\cite=primes], What is the regularized product over all the Fibonacci numbers? In other words, what is: where [formula] is the nth Fibonacci number? First we define what we mean by 'regularized product.'

The regularized product of [formula] is where ζA is the regularized zeta function

The Fibonacci numbers are [formula], [formula] and then for n  ≥  2. The nth Fibonacci number can be expressed as where [formula] is the Golden Mean. The Fibonacci zeta function is which, by the ratio test, is absolutely convergent for [formula]. Its derivative with respect to s is From the definition, the regularized product of the Fibonacci numbers is

[formula]

Unfortunately, the derivative of the Fibonacci zeta function diverges as s  →  0 and therefore must be regularized. Adding and subtracting the leading divergence gives

[formula]

The first term is a meromorphic function and the second term converges as s  →  0. The Laurent expansion about s = 0 is The sum simplifies,

[formula]

where c is the Fibonacci factorial constant [\cite=finch] [\cite=sloane]. Thus, The regularized value is the limit as s  →  0 once the principal part has been removed, that is, Using equation ([\ref=eq:delta]), The Fibonacci factorial constant can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the Jacobi theta function of the first kind. Consequently, Numerically, [formula].
