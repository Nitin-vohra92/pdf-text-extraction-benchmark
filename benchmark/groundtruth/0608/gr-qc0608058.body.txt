On Primordial Perturbations of Test Scalar Fields

Due to the central role of primordial perturbations on the formation of cosmological structure, it is very important to probe their possible nature and origin. The primordial curvature perturbations are generally supposed to originate from the vacuum fluctuation of inflaton during the inflation [\cite=BST], see also Ref. [\cite=MC]. However, it is also possible that the curvature perturbations are generated by the decay of curvaton field [\cite=LW] [\cite=MT], see also Ref. [\cite=LM], or the fluctuated coupling constants during the reheating [\cite=DGZK] [\cite=K], see also Ref. [\cite=T], in which it is required that the perturbations of test scalar fields not affecting the evolution of background during the generation of perturbations can be transferred to the curvature perturbations in the radiation after the reheating, thus the final amplitude of the spectrum turns out not to be directly related to inflation. This to some extent relaxes some bounds on the inflation models and makes the building of models more flexible [\cite=DL], see also Ref. [\cite=P].

The causal primordial perturbations may be generated in the (super)accelerated expanding backgrounds, in which the perturbations can leave the horizon during their generation and then reenter the horizon after the transition which is followed by standard FRW evolution. During the (super)accelerated expansion ah increases with time, where [formula] is the Hubble parameter. Thus the evolution of scale factor can be simply taken as a(t)  ~  tn,(t  →    ∞  ) with n > 1 and a(t)  ~  ( - t)n,(t  →  0-) with n negative. Though during the (super)accelerated expansion, the primordial perturbations originated from the vacuum fluctuations of the background field can be also produced, their spectra are generally not scale invariant, see Ref. [\cite=PZ2] for details. However, as was mentioned, since the perturbations of test scalar fields can be transferred to the curvature perturbations in the radiation by some mechanisms, it can be very interesting to study the primordial perturbations originated from the test scalar fields in the (super)accelerated expanding backgrounds. The relevant studies can also be seen in the earlier literatures, e.g. on PBB scenario [\cite=V]. In this brief report, we will briefly show our result, and then discuss relevant issues and differences from those in the previous studies.

We will assume that n is a constant for simplicity, and work with the parameter [formula], which describes the change of h in unit of Hubble time and depicts the abrupt degree of background change. Thus for above background we have ε  =  1 / n  <  1. In the conformal time η, we obtain a(η)  ~  ( - η)1 / (ε - 1). Thus we have the scale factor

[formula]

Note that the later the perturbation reenters the horizon at late time, the earlier its generation will be. Generally it may be convenient for our purpose to define

[formula]

which measures the efolding number of mode with some scale ~  k- 1 which leaves the horizon before the end of the (super)accelerated expanding phase, where the subscript 'e' denotes the end time of the (super)accelerated expanding phase, and thus ke is the last mode to be generated, see Ref. [\cite=KST]. When taking ah = a0h0, where the subscript '0' denotes the present time, we generally have N  ~  50, which is required by observable cosmology. From Eq.([\ref=ah]), we can obtain

[formula]

which, combined with Eq.([\ref=caln]), induces ae / a = eN / (1 - ε). Thus we can see that the change of scale factor is quite dependent on ε, e.g. when ε≃0, the scale factor exponentially expands, which is the case of usual inflation models, while for enough negative ε, the change of scale factor is generally very small, and further in the limit ε  →    -    ∞  , the scale factor will be nearly unchanged, which corresponds to the case in Ref. [\cite=Piao] [\cite=Piaoii]. From Eqs.([\ref=caln]) and ([\ref=asim]), we can obtain

[formula]

Thus we can see that when ε≃0, h is nearly unchanged, while when ε  →    -    ∞  , we have he / h≃ke / k, whose logarithm is the efolding number. The Eq. ([\ref=hhe]) will be used in the following.

For the test scalar field φ, in the momentum space, its motion equation is given by

[formula]

where uk is related to the perturbation of φ by [formula] and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to η, and f(η) can be generally written as (v2 - 1 / 4) / η2, in which v is determined by the evolution of background and the details of φ field, such as its mass, its coupling to the background. When v is approximately a constant, this equation is a Bessel equation, whose general solutions are the Hankel functions. In the regime kη  →    ∞  , all interesting modes are very deep in the horizon of the (super)accelerated expanding background, thus Eq.([\ref=uki]) can be reduced to the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator, in which uk  ~  e- ikη / (2k)1 / 2, which in some sense suggests that the initial condition can be taken as usual Minkowski vacuum. In the superhorizon scale, in which the modes become unstable and grow, the expansion of Hankel functions to the leading term of k gives

[formula]

where the phase factor and the constant with order one have been neglected.

Unless ε≃0, during the (super)accelerated expansion the Hubble parameter h of the background will be changed all along. Thus based on 1 / η  =  (1 - ε)ah and Eq.([\ref=uk]), the amplitude of perturbations of φ can be expected to continue to change after the corresponding perturbations leaving the horizon, up to the end of the (super)accelerated expanding phase. This suggests that in principle we should take the value of uk at the time when the (super)accelerated expanding phase ends to calculate the amplitude of perturbations. The power spectrum of perturbations of scalar field φ is given by k3 / 2|φk|  ~  k3 / 2|uk(ηe) / ae|. Thus from Eq.([\ref=uk]), we have

[formula]

where ke = aehe has been used and g = (1 - ε)v - 1 / 2, which is obtained by using 1 / ηe  =  (1 - ε)aehe. From Eq. ([\ref=pt]), it can be noticed that generally different from the curvature perturbation on spatial slice of uniform energy density, in which we can reasonably take the value h of Hubble parameter at the time when a given wavelength ~  k- 1 crosses the horizon to calculate the amplitude of perturbation since the comoving curvature perturbation is nearly constant in the superhorizon scale, here we have to take the value he to do so, since the perturbations of test scalar field is generally not expected to be constant but change in the superhorizon scale up to the end of (super)accelerated expanding phase. Thus when the spectrum k3 / 2|φk| is scale invariant, i.e. v≃3 / 2, we obtain the amplitude ≃g  ·  he / 2π, not h / 2π as usual. Further, it may be interesting to see that there is a factor g in Eq.([\ref=pt]), which can be neglected for |ε| < 1 but can lead to an important magnifying of the amplitude of perturbations when ε  →    -    ∞  . This was not noticed in the earlier references.

Let us firstly check in which cases Eq. ([\ref=pt]) can be recovered to the familiar case, in which the value h of Hubble parameter at the time when a given wavelength crosses the horizon may be used to calculate the amplitude of corresponding perturbation. When the scalar field is massless, we have [formula], and thus [formula], in which the subscript 'l' denotes the quantity corresponding to the massless scalar field. Combining it and Eq.([\ref=hhe]) into Eq.([\ref=pt]), we have

[formula]

which is just the usual result used to the massless scalar field. Though there is a factor g in Eq.([\ref=vkl]), it dose not affect the amplitude significantly since in the massless case [formula] for arbitrary value of ε < 1. For the case of inflation, in which ε≃0, which leads to v≃3 / 2  +  ε and g = 1, we have the familiar result

[formula]

This has been discussed in Ref. [\cite=LR] in the slow-roll approximation.

However, the case can be very different for e.g. the massive scalar field. In this case, we have

[formula]

where ah(1 - ε) = 1 / η has been used, and v2m = v2l  -  (mφ / h(1 - ε))2, the subscript 'm' denotes the quantity corresponding to the massive scalar field. Note that h  ~  1 / ( - t) generally changes with the time in the (super)accelerated background, which makes vm not constant, thus Eq.([\ref=uki]) will be not the exact Bessel equation, which makes us very difficult to obtain its analytic solution. However, there are also some exceptions. If there exists a non-minimally coupling ~  Rφ2 between φ and gravity, where R  ~  h2 is the Ricci curvature scalar, we will have that m2φ  ~  R  ~  h2, and thus m2φ / h2 (and then vm) is a constant. Note that if mφ is far larger than h(1 - ε), vm will become imaginary, and thus can not be attached to the spectrum index of φk, since in order to obtain the power spectrum of φ we need to take the module square of uk in Eq.([\ref=uk]). Thus the value of m2φ should be small positive, or negative for our purpose. The solution of Eq.([\ref=uki]) with f(η) given by Eq.([\ref=fm]), which corresponds to replace v in Eq.([\ref=pt]) with vm, is

[formula]

where in the second line Eq.([\ref=hhe]) has been used. Firstly, since generally vl  ≠  vm it seems that we can not take the value of h at the time when a given wavelength crosses the horizon to calculate the amplitude of perturbations, unless the exponent part of k / ke in Eq.([\ref=mpt]) can be approximately cancelled, i.e. vl≃vm, which suggests m2φ / (1 - ε)2h2  ≪  1 and corresponds to the massless case discussed in last paragraph. The above results can be also understood as follows. For the massless scalar field, in the superhorizon scale, i.e. kη  →  0, we have [formula]. Thus uk  ~  a is the solution of this equation. This means that in the superhorizon scale |φk| = |uk / a| is a constant, thus we can use the value h of Hubble parameter at the time when a given wavelength crosses the horizon to calculate the amplitude of perturbation. However, for the massive scalar field, when kη  →  0, we have [formula]. This equation has one growing solution and one decay solution. The growing solution is given by [formula], where a(η)  ~  ( - η)1 / (ε - 1) has been used. Thus generally one can not obtain that the |φk| = |uk / a| is constant, which ocurrs only when [formula]. Taking vm defined in Eq.([\ref=fm]), one can find that [formula] corresponds to vm  =  vl, i.e. the massless case mφ  =  0 . We can take arbitrary values of ε < 1 to validate it. For example taking ε  =   - 1 and m2φ / (1 - ε)2h2 =  - 5 / 4  ≠  0, we have vm = 3 / 2. Thus we can obtain [formula], whose solution is uk  ~  η- 1. Since a  ~  ( - η)1 / (ε - 1)  ~  η- 1 / 2, one can obtain |φk| = |uk / a|  ~  a, which increases with the time. This means that φk is generally changed in the superhorizon scale. In principle this change will last all along to the end of the (super)accelerated expanding phase. Thus with this consideration it seems that in general case we have to take the value at the time when the (super)accelerated expanding phase ends to calculate the amplitude of perturbations.

Secondly, when ε  →    -    ∞  , we have g = (1 - ε)vm - 1 / 2≃|ε|vm - 1 / 2, and thus

[formula]

From Eq.([\ref=ge]), we can see that if vm > 1 / 2 but [formula], the amplitude of perturbations will be strongly magnified by ε in the factor g. For example, for the scale invariant spectrum in which vm = 3 / 2, we have the amplitude ≃|ε|he / 2π, in this case the magnification is proportional to ε. The above result is not difficult to be understood. Note that as was mentioned in the definition, what ε depicts is the abrupt degree of background change. Generally the change of background will lead to the increase of inhomogeneity, the more abrupt the change is, the more inhomogeneous the background after the change is. |ε|  ≫  1 corresponds to a very abrupt change of background, thus it can be expected that the amplitude of perturbations will obtain a significant magnification related with the abrupt change of background. This result means that for the (super)accelerated expanding phase with |ε|  ≫  1, the he (and thus the energy scale) at the end time should be far lower than the case with ε≃0 in order to make the amplitude of perturbations responsible for the structure formation of observable universe.

There have been some studies on the inflation with ε < 0, e.g. the phantom inflation [\cite=PZ] [\cite=PZ1] [\cite=GJ] [\cite=BFM], the ghost inflation [\cite=ACMZ]. The extending to ε  →    -    ∞   can be straight by adjusting the parameters. In addition, in the island universe model [\cite=Piao] [\cite=Piaoii], in which initially the universe is in a cosmological constant sea, then the local and abrupt background changes (quantum fluctuations) violating the null energy condition create some islands with matter and radiation, which under certain conditions might corresponds to our observable universe, one also take ε  →    -    ∞   to describe the very abrupt change of background. In this case v2l≃1 / 4, and thus m2φ / (1 - ε)2h2≃ - 2 is required to make the spectrum scale invariant, i.e. make vm = 3 / 2, the resulting amplitude of perturbations is |ε|(he / 2π), see also Ref. [\cite=DV] for a different study.

In summary, we studied the perturbations of test scalar fields not affecting the evolution of background in the (super)accelerated expanding backgrounds. In general case, the perturbations are not unchanged in the superhorizon scale, thus in this note we use the value of h at the time when the (super)accelerated expanding phase ends to calculate the amplitude of perturbations, as was showed in Eq.([\ref=pt]). More interestingly, we note that there is a factor g in Eq.([\ref=pt]), which is relevant with the abrupt degree of background change and may lead to a significant magnifying of the amplitude of perturbations when the background changes very abruptly, i.e. |ε|  ≫  1. Its origin are discussed in detail here. When considering the (nearly) massless scalar fields, the usual case in which the amplitude of perturbation can be calculated by taking the value h of Hubble parameter at the time when a given wavelength crosses the horizon can be recovered. In this case the factor g  ~  O(1) is negligible. This study may be interesting for the building of early universe models dependent of test scalar field providing the primordial perturbations.
