For a positive C∞-function a(u) let

[formula]

In the region z > 0, ds2 represents the anti-de Sitter space-time if and only if a(u) is linear in u. Now, let d2a / du2    <    0 and

[formula]

Then [formula] and [formula] with Λ    =      -  3 and Tij    =    φ,i  φ,j. So (ds2,  φ) represents a solution of Einstein's equation with negative cosmological term Λ and a minimally coupled massless scalar field φ. Let I be a curvature invariant of order k, i.e., I is a scalar

[formula]

depending continuously on all its arguments. Then for the metric ds2, I does not depend on the function a(u).

This seems to be the first example that non-isometric space-times with non-vanishing curvature scalar cannot be distinguished by curvature invariants. The proof essentially uses the non-compactness of the Lorentz group SO(3,1), here of the boosts u  →  u  λ, v  →  v / λ. One can see this also in the representation theory in comparison with the representations of the compact rotation group SO(4).

Let v∈R4 be a vector and g∈SO(4) such that [formula], then g(v) = v. In Minkowski space-time M4, however, there exist vectors v∈M4 and a h∈SO(3,1) with [formula] and h(v)  ≠  v. This is the reason why the null frame components of the curvature tensor called Cartan "scalars" are not always curvature scalars.
