Key words: radial Schrödinger equation, WKB series, approximate wavefunctions

Similar questions arise when we use the perturbation theory or the variational method in order to solve the radial Schrödinger equation

[formula]

How to find the unperturbed Hamiltonian or how to find the trial function for an arbitrary given potential? The universal answers are absent. In this sense both mentioned methods are not complete. At the same time the WKB approximation is directly determined by a given potential. The WKB approach deals with a logarithmic derivative

[formula]

which satisfies the nonlinear Riccati equation

[formula]

In this approach two independent solutions Y±(r) of the Riccati equation are represented by their asymptotic expansions

[formula]

in powers of Plank's constant [formula]. The usual WKB approximation contains a finite number of leading terms Y±n(r) from the complete expansion Y±as(r). The conventional WKB approximation is not valid at turning points.

As it is well known, the WKB series is divergent. The direct summation of a divergent series does not exist. By summing one means finding a function to which this series is the asymptotic expansion [\cite=bend1]. There are several investigations on properties of the WKB terms [\cite=bend2] [\cite=robn]. In recent years many studies have been devoted to extracting some useful information about the exact eigenfunctions from the divergent WKB series (see for instance [\cite=pham] and references therein). In our previous work [\cite=kudr1] we reconstructed the WKB series as a sum of new constituent (partial) asymptotic series. The explicit summation of the leading constituent series was performed. As a result the new quasi-uniform approximation to logarithmic derivatives was obtained. This approximation was derived formerly [\cite=kudr2] by other means. Our approximation reproduces the known satisfactory approximation [\cite=bend1] near turning points. The proposed method was verified in the case of the one-dimensional Schródinger equation without singularities [\cite=kudr3]. In the present work we apply our approach to the radial Schródinger equation with the centrifugal term which is singular at the origin (r = 0).

The second-order quasi-uniform approximation has the following form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here we introduce notations for logarithmic derivatives

[formula]

of linear combinations of well studied Airy functions Ai(a) and Bi(a) [\cite=hand]. The value of an arbitrary parameter t determines a selected particular solution. We also use notation

[formula]

We consider power-law potentials

[formula]

When l  =  0 we deal with the usual one-dimensional problem for odd states which was solved formerly. When l  ≠  0 we have a new problem. In this case there are two turning points r- and r+ (r+  >  r-) which satisfy equation Q(r)  =  0. Turning points separate three regions.

In the first region where r  >  r+ we must describe only the decreasing solution of the Schrödinger equation. Therefore in this case we select the unique particular solution Y(r;0) of the Riccati equation.

In the second region where r-  <  r  <  r+ we must describe oscillating solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Therefore in this case we select two particular solutions Y(r;  ±  i) of the Riccati equation.

In the third region where r  <  r- we must reproduce the known behaviour of the exact solution Ψex(r) of the Schrödinger equation when r  →  0. In this case we have following simple formulas

[formula]

At the same time we can derive relations

[formula]

Thus, the approximate logarithmic derivative tends as follow

[formula]

where

[formula]

Naturally we must demand

[formula]

It is the quadratic algebraic equation for determining the value of t. One of two solutions leads to an unphysical singularity. The second solution (nearest to zero ) tl gives dependence of t on l. We present two numerical examples t1  =   - 0.00393839,t2  =   - 0.000523169. Hence, in third region we select the unique particular solution Y(r;tl) of the Riccati equation.

Matching particular solutions at turning points we obtain the continuous approximate wavefunction Ψap(r) which is represented by following formulas

[formula]

when r  <  r-,

[formula]

when r-  <  r  <  r+ and

[formula]

when r  >  r+. Here

[formula]

and N is a normalization constant.

We have the new quantization condition

[formula]

which determines the spectral value Esp(n,l) of energy implicitly. We denote the approximate wavefunctions with E  =  Esp(n,l) as Ψap(r;n,l).

So the approximate eigenfunctions are defined completely. But the question arises about the optimal approximate eigenvalues because the value Esp(n,l) is not unique choice.

Since explicit expressions for wavefunctions are already obtained we are able to calculate expectation values

[formula]

of the radial Hamiltonian

[formula]

where |Ψap(n,l) >  is the vector in the Hilbert space which corresponds to the function Ψap(r;n,l).

In accordance with the eigenvalue problem Ĥ|Ψ  >   - E|Ψ  >    =  0 we construct the discrepancy vector

[formula]

with an arbitrary parameter e while Ĥr and |Ψap(n,l) >  are given. It is natural to require that the discrepancy vector should not contain a component proportional to the approximate eigenvector. In other words we consider the orthogonality condition <  Ψap(n,l)|D(e;n,l) >   =  0 as a criterion for selection of the optimal approximate eigenvalue. As a result we get just the expectation value Ē(n,l) while Esp(n,l) does not fulfil the above requirement. It should be also noted that the scalar product < D(e;n,l)|D(e;n,l) >  is minimized at e  =  Ē(n,l).

Now we must verify our approximation numerically for the exactly solvable problems. We shall compare the normalized approximate wavefunctions Ψap(r;n,l) with the normalized exact wavefunctions Ψex(r;n,l).

In order to estimate the closeness of two functions f1(r) and f2(r) we consider two corresponding vectors |f1  >   and |f2  >   in the Hilbert space. Then we construct a deviation vector |Δf >   =  |f1  >    -  |f2  >   and a scalar product

[formula]

Now we can define the relative deviation

[formula]

as the numerical estimation of the closeness of two functions. Note that δf  =  0 when f1(r)  =  f2(r).

Thus, we get the following estimation

[formula]

in the case of normalized real functions Ψex(r;n,l) and Ψap(r;n,l). The same numerical comparison may be performed

[formula]

for first derivatives Ψ'(r)  =  dΨ(r) / dr. Naturally, we can define analogous estimations for higher derivatives.

Now we compare two functions ĤrΨap(r;n,l) and Ē(n,l)Ψap(r;n,l). This comparison may be performed when we do not know exact solutions. As a result we get the relative discrepancy

[formula]

which is directly connected with the initial Schrödinger equation under consideration.

Finally, we characterize our approximation by the usual relative energy error

[formula]

where Eex(n,l) is the exact energy value.

Firstly, we estimate our approximation in the case of the oscillator potential V(r)  =  α2r2 for which the exact wavefunctions are well known [\cite=flug].Table 1 shows that the quasi-uniform approximation gives fairly accurate results for all considered quantities in the oscillator case.

Table 1. V(r)  =  α2r2.

The second example is the linear in r potential V(r)  =  α1r . When l  =  0 the quasi-uniform approximation reproduces the exact result. When l  ≠  0 the exact wavefunctions are unknown but there are results of numerical solution for some energies [\cite=eich]. We calculate values of d and δE for these states.Table 2 demonstrates validity of our approximation in the linear case.

Table 2. V(r)  =  α1r

Hence, the performed reconstruction of the WKB series and subsequent explicit summation of the leading constituent (partial) series yield the satisfactory (qualitative and quantitative) description of wavefunctions in the case of the radial Schrödinger equation with power-law potentials.
