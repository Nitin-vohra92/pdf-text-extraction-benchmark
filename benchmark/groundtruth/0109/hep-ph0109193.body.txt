Phenomenological Estimation of Parameters in minimal Supergravity Model

Introduction

In the minimal supergravity model(mSUGRA)[\cite=Nilles], five arbitrary parameters (m0, m1 / 2, tan β, A0, sig(μ)) are included. If these parameters are specified, all the mass of the particles are derived by the analysis of renormalization group flow. Recently, the mass of Standard model(SM) Higgs boson has been evaluated by LEP[\cite=Erler]. The reported Higgs mass is slight smaller than expected. This fact encourages the mSUGRA, because such light value of the Higgs mass is supported as one of the features of this model. If the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson in mSUGRA is close to the mentioned above the mass of Higgs boson in the SM[\cite=Okada], a constraint condition among m0, m1 / 2 and tan β is obtained. In order to determine their values completely, some additional conditions are introduced as follows:

Assuming the SU(5) GUT scenario, the gauge and the Yukawa coupling constants of D-type quarks and leptons are unified at GUT scale MX, respectively[\cite=Barger].

As one of the conditions of mSUGRA, B0 is equal to (A0 - 1)m0 at MX[\cite=Nilles]. At MZ scale, two different B(MZ) values are obtained; (a) by RGE development from MX scale, and (b) by the Higgs potential at MZ scale directly. A0 is tuned numerically to make both B(MZ) values match from each other.

The condition sig(μ) > 0 is derived from the analysis of the g-2 experiment[\cite=Chattopadhyay].

As the results, m0 - m1 / 2 regions, mass spectra, and the lightest supersymmetric particle(LSP) is shown in the following sections by making use of the above conditions in this paper.

Analysis of Parameters

On the tan β

On the optimization of tan β value is discussed by the two-loop level renormalization group equations(RGEs) [\cite=Barger] [\cite=Castano] of the gauge and Yukawa coupling constants in this section. Boundary conditions of the RGEs are given at Z-boson mass scale MZ. Their values at MZ scale are referred from the latest Particle Data Group[\cite=Particle].

gauge coupling constants The average value αX among α1,α2 and α3 is introduced around GUT scale MX. χ2 fitting function is made of the squared sum of each differences between αX and αi(i = 1  ~  3) as follows:

[formula]

where, σi is the standard deviation of αi. The energy scale where the χ2 becomes minimal is defined as MX value. The value of χ2 is shown as a function of tan β in fig.1 . By the way, another mass scale parameter MSUSY≃1(TeV) is used to be introduced as a turning-on point of the sparticles' effect, however, since a3 is estimated 0.118 by the latest P.D.G., such MSUSY becomes less than the scale MZ[\cite=Amaldi]. Therefore, the MSUSY is neglected in this paper.

Yukawa coupling constants When the SU(5) scenario is presumed [\cite=Barger], Yukawa coupling constants of D-type quark and lepton is supposed to coincide at MX. Their χ2 fitting function is defined as the following equations:

[formula]

[formula]

where, the suffix i denotes the generation, and q implies D-type quarks or Leptons. Moreover, with taking the CKM matrix[\cite=Particle] into consideration, Yukawa coupling constants of RGEs are diagonalized. The tan β dependence on χ2 at MX scale is shown in fig. 2. In the minimal SO (10) scenario [\cite=Barger], once the mass spectra of the particles in the lower energy scale region are fixed to their observed values, required unification of Yukawa coupling constants is failed. With likelihood analysis of tan β, it is failed to determine the optimized value of tan β to unify the Yukawa coupling constants.

According to the above mentioned 1) and 2), the value of tan β is implied as much as 7.5 . As the result, in order to keep the unification among gauge coupling constants, it is impossible to unify the Yukawa coupling constants at MX as shown in fig.3 and fig.4 .

On the A0

As mentioned in avant, one B(MZ) value is obtained by 1-loop level RGEs [\cite=Castano] [\cite=Inoue] development with boundary constraint condition B0 = (A0 - 1)m0 at MX scale. Another B(MZ) is calculated at MZ as

[formula]

[formula]

where, mhd and mhu are soft breaking mass parameters of two Higgs doublet at MZ. A0 is determined by the numerical tuning to coincide both B(MZ) values. It is shown that A0 at m1 / 2 / m0=8 / 3, 1, 3 / 8 as functions of tan β in fig.5 .

On the sig(μ)

sig(μ) > 0 is assumed by the result of the g-2 experiment[\cite=Chattopadhyay].

On the experiment result of LEP.

As the experimental results of LEP [\cite=LEP], the lightest neutral Higgs mass in the SUSY models exists in the region from 90(GeV) to 130(GeV). However, the lightest neutral Higgs mass is supposed to be beyond 115(GeV) like SM Higgs [\cite=Erler] in this paper, because such small mass as 90(GeV) makes difficulties to evaluate m0 and m1 / 2.

Numerical results

m0 - m1 / 2 plane

Higgs mass is calculated by the 1-loop level RGE analysis as follows [\cite=Carena]:

[formula]

Corresponding m0 - m1 / 2 regions are shown with several Higgs mass settings(115,120 and 130 (GeV)) with tan β=3, 8, and 20 in fig.5, fig.6, and fig.7, respectively.

The region below the horizontal line is excluded by the chargino mass bound mχ± > 91(GeV). Moreover, the region in the left side of the ordinate line is excluded by the fact that it is not charged particle(tau slepton), the LSP must be neutral particle(neutralino).

mass spectra

m0 is assumed to coincide with the result of g-2 experiment. The predictions of the mass spectra with several different tan β are listed on Table 1.

lightest supersymmetric particle(LSP) The mass of the LSP as a function of tan β is shown at m0=200, 500 and 800 (GeV) in fig. 8. Note that the neutralino is most plausible candidate of the LSP.

Summary and Conclusion

The parameters of mSUGRA are estimated by several conditions phenomenologically. tan β is estimated about 7.5 by using RGEs of the gauge and Yukawa coupling constants. A0 is fixed by the constraint at MX and the conditions at MZ. The allowed m0 - m1 / 2 regions are shown with several values of the Higgs boson's mass. The mass spectra and the mass of the LSP are calculated. Needless-to-say, it is important to find at least one supersymmetric particle experimentally for the reality of mSUGRA or other supersymmetric models. With the results shown in this paper, the supersymmetric particles are not so much heavy, and possible to be observed by colliders in the near future.
