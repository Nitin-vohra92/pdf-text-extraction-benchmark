Fujiki relation on symplectic varieties

Introduction

We start with the definition of a symplectic variety.

A compact Kähler variety Z is said to be a symplectic variety if Z satisfies the following conditions: For a smooth locus U on Z, there exists a nondegenerate holomorphic 2-form ω on U. This form is extended to a regular form [formula] on [formula], where ν:  →  Z is a resolution of singularities of Z.

In [\cite=namikawa1], Namikawa induced a quadratic form qZ on [formula], which is a natural extension of Beauville-Bogomolov quadratic form defined in [\cite=beauville2] on singular varieties. In [\cite=fujiki], Fujiki proved that Beauville-Bogomolov quadratic form has special relation with cup products. We prove that qZ has same properties.

Let Z be a 2n-dimensional projective symplectic variety and ν:  →  Z a resolution of singularities of Z. Assume that

The codimension of the singular locus of Z is greater than four.

Z has only [formula]-factorial singularities.

dim H1(Z,OZ)  =  0 and dim H2(Z,OZ)  =  1.

According to [\cite=namikawa1], we define the quadratic form qZ on [formula] by

[formula]

where α̃: = ν*α and [formula]. Then qZ(α) satisfies the following equation:

[formula]

Note that a constant CZ depends on only Z. Moreover the index of qZ is [formula].

Remark 1.   By [\cite=namikawa2], when Z is symplectic varieties with only terminal singularities, the condition of codimension of singular locus is always satisfied.

Remark 2.   Namikawa obtained the index of qZ in [\cite=namikawa3] by different method.

Let Z be a projective symplectic variety which satisfies the conditions of Theorem [\ref=main] and D a Cartier divisor on Z. Then Riemann-Roch formula of D is expressed as follows:

[formula]

where ak (0  ≤  k  ≤  n) are constants which depend on only Z.

As an application of Theorem [\ref=main], we obtain the following result:

Let Z be a 2n-dimensional projective symplectic variety which satisfies the conditions of Theorem [\ref=main]. Assume that there exists a surjective morphism f:Z  →  B over a projective normal variety B and a general fibre F of f has positive dimension. Then F and B has the following properties:

dim B  =  n and Picard number of B is one.

F is an n-dimensional abelian variety.

For the singular locus Zsing of Z, f(Zsing) forms a proper closed subset of B and the restriction ω to F is identically zero.

For every effective divisor D of Z, dim f(D)  ≥   dim B - 1.

Remark 3.   Comparing the above corollary with [\cite=matsu], there exist two difference: One is ampleness of - KB and another one is [formula]-factoriality of B. In section 3, we construct an example such that - KB is not ample.

We prove Theorem [\ref=main] and [\ref=main2] in Section 2. A proof of Corollary [\ref=application] and an example are given in Section 3.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

(2.1) We start with the investigation of the rank of qZ.

The rank of qZ is greater than three.

Proof.   Let ν:  →  Z be a resolution of singularities of Z and [formula] a extension of ω on [formula]. By the definition of qZ, qZ(  +  ) > 0 and qZ(  -  i)  >  0. Let α be an ample divisor on Z. If we choose a suitable exceptional divisor E, ν*α  -  E becomes an ample divisor. From [\cite=namikawa1], n - 1|E  =  0. Hence

[formula]

Thus qZ(α) > 0 by Hodge-Riemann bilinear relation. [formula]

(2.2) Let D be the Kuranishi space of Z, Z the Kuranishi family and Zs the fibre at s∈D. By [\cite=namikawa1], for every point of s∈D, there exists an isomorphism [formula]. The period map [formula] defined by p(s): = φ- 1s(ωs), where ωs is a symplectic form of Zs.

Let νs:  →  Zs be a resolution of Zs. We define a quadric form on [formula] by

[formula]

where α̃: = ν*sα and [formula]. Then qZs is not depend the choice of [formula] and

[formula]

Proof.   We prove that qZs is independent of the choice of resolution by similar argument in the proof of [\cite=namikawa1] and obtain the rank of qZs is greater than three by similar argument of Lemma [\ref=rank]. The period map [formula] is defined by ps(t): = φs(p(t)).

Let [formula]. Then ps(D)  ⊂  Qs.

Proof.   Let [formula]. For the smooth locus of Us of Zs, there exists Hodge decomposition of [formula] and an isomorphism [formula] by [\cite=namikawa1]. Hence we write α as α  =  aωs  +  w  +  bs. By direct calculation

[formula]

Let E be an irreducible component of the exceptional locus of s  →  Zs. Assume α: = φsφ- 1t(ωt). Then α̃n + 1|Us = 0 because α|Us is a holomorphic two form on the smooth locus Ut of Zt and Ut is deformation equivalent to Us by [\cite=namikawa1]. By [\cite=namikawa1], n - 1s|E = 0. Hence the left hand side equals zero. If t is very near to s, we obtain [formula]. Thus we obtain qZs(α)  =  0.

We continue the proof of Lemma [\ref=prep1]. By the above Claim, φs maps an open set of Q0 to an open set of Qs isomorphically. Since both quadric surfaces are irreducible, we obtain that φs(Q0)  =  Qs. Since qZs(ωs  +  s)  =  1, we are done.

(2.3) The following Lemma is the key of the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] and [\ref=main2] which is based on arguments in [\cite=bogomolov] and [\cite=Huyhab].

Let ν:  →  Z be a resolution of Z and [formula] the open set set of D such that the morphism   →  D is smooth over [formula]. We fix one point s of [formula]. Let [formula] and τ a (k,k)-form on s. If τ is a (k,k)-form on every fibre t near s,

[formula]

where Ck is a constant depending on only Zs.

Proof.   Let Ss be the hypersurface in [formula] defined by

[formula]

If we prove that Qs  =  Ss, we obtain equation ([\ref=desired]) because both hand sides of ([\ref=desired]) have same degree and same zero locus. We choose an open set V of Qs which is contained in [formula]. For every point α∈V, there exists the point t of [formula] such that α defines a symplectic form on the smooth part of Zt. Thus τ  ·  (ν*α)n - k + 1  =  0 in [formula] and hence τ  ·  (ν*α)n - k + 1  =  0 in [formula]. By analytic continuation, we obtain τ  ·  (ν*α)n - k + 1 = 0 for every point of Qs. Therefore we obtain Qs  ⊂  Ss. We prove the opposite inclusion. Assume the contrary. Then there exists [formula] such that τ  ·  ν*β2(n - k)  =  0 and [formula]. We choose a general element γ of [formula] such that τ  ·  γ2(n - k)  ≠  0. Then the line which pass β and γ intersect Qs with two points. Let δ0 and δ1 be these points. We write

[formula]

We remark that λ*  *  ≠  0 because β, γ and δ* are mutually distinct. Since τ  ·  (ν*δ0)n - k + 1  =  τ  ·  (ν*δ1)n - k + 1  =  0,

[formula]

That derives a contradiction.

(2.4)Proof of Theorem [\ref=main].   From Lemma [\ref=key_lemma], we obtain

[formula]

Since φs(α)2n  =  α2n, we obtain that CZqZ(α)n  =  α2n by Lemma [\ref=prep1]. We investigate the index of qZ. From [\cite=namikawa1], there exists Hodge decomposition of [formula]. Let A be an ample divisor on Z and H an element of [formula] such that qZ(H,A)  =  0. We consider the following equation:

[formula]

If we compare λ term of both hand sides, we obtain H.A2n - 1  =  0 from the assumption qZ(A,H)  =  0. By Hodge-Riemann bilinear relation,

[formula]

Hence H2.A2n - 2  <  0 if [formula]. Comparing λ2 term of the both hand side of the equation ([\ref=nondegenerate]), we obtain qZ(H)  <  0 if [formula]. Combining Lemma [\ref=rank], the index of qZ is [formula].

(2.5) Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2].   From the proof of (1) of [\cite=namikawa1],

[formula]

is isomorphism. Hence χZ(D)  =  χZs(φs(D)). By Lemma [\ref=prep1], it is enough to prove that there exists constants Ck (0  ≤  k  ≤  n) and they satisfy

[formula]

for a Cartier divisor D of Zs. Let us consider χs(ν*D). By [\cite=namikawa1], Zs has only rational singularities. Thus χZs(D)  =  χs(ν*D). By Serre duality

[formula]

Hence each term of Riemann-Roch formula of χs(ν*D) is expressed

[formula]

Since polynomials of Chern classes remain (k,k)-form under small deformation, we obtain each term of Riemann-Roch formula is expressed as CkqZs(D)k by Lemma [\ref=key_lemma].

Fibre space structure

(3.1) We prove Corollary [\ref=application] in three steps:

We fix some notations. Let A be an ample divisor on Z and H an ample divisor on B.

(3.2) Step 1.   From Theorem [\ref=main],

[formula]

Since CZqZ(f*H)  =  (f*H)2n  =  0, we obtain

[formula]

If we compare both hand sides the above equation, we obtain

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=rank], qZ(A)  >  0. Hence qZ(A,f*H)  >  0 and

[formula]

Hence dim B  =  n.

(3.3) Step 2.   Let F be a general fibre of f and UF the smooth part of F. In order to prove [formula], we prove

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where c is a nonzero constant. Hence we will show ωAn - 2(f*H)n  =  0. By Theorem [\ref=main],

[formula]

Calculating the left hand side, we obtain

[formula]

From the definition of qZ in Theorem [\ref=main],

[formula]

Thus we conclude that ωAn - 2(f*H)n  =  0 by comparing the sn - 2tn term of both hands sides.

(3.4) Step 3.   Let U be the smooth locus of Z. If we choose a point x of B generally, [formula] is smooth at x and [formula]. We consider the following diagram:

[formula]

From the above diagram and Step 2, h0(TUF)  =  n. Then F is an Abelian variety by the following Lemma.

Let F be a normal variety such that KF  ~  OF and h0(TUF)  =   dim F, where UF is the smooth locus of F. Then F is an Abelian variety.

Proof.   Since F is normal, [formula]. Hence h0(ΘF)  =   dim F by analytic continuation. Let [formula] be a resolution of F. Then [formula]. Since KF  ~  OF, we have an injection [formula]. Hence [formula]. By Serre duality [formula] From Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem, [formula]. Hence h1(F,OF)  ≥   dim F. By [\cite=Abelian_Characterization], F is an abelian variety.

Since F is a complete intersection in Z, Z is smooth in a neighbourhood of F and f(Zsing) forms a proper closed subset of B.

(3.5)Step 4.   Let D be a Cartier divisor on B. We prove that [formula] for a suitable number λ. From Theorem [\ref=main], qZ is nondegenerate. Hence it is enough to prove that

[formula]

From Theorem [\ref=main], we obtain CZqZ(f*(D  +  λH))n  =  (f*(D  +  λH))2n  =  0 for every λ. Hence if we choose λ suitably, we obtain qZ(f*(D  +  λH),A)  =  0.

(3.6) Step 5.  Let D be an effective divisor on Z. We derive a contradiction assuming that dim f(D)  <   dim B - 1. Under this assumption, we obtain that D.f*Hn - 1 is numerically trivial. The following equation

[formula]

tells us that qZ(D,f*H)  =  0 because Dnf*Hn  =  0. We consider the following equation:

[formula]

Comparing stn - 1-term of the both hand sides, we obtain that qZ(D,A)qZ(A,f*H)  =  0. For an effective divisor E on Z, we consider the following equation:

[formula]

Comparing t-term of the both hand sides, we obtain that qZ(D,A)  >  0 and qZ(f*H,A)  >  0. That derives a contradiction.

(3.7) Under the conditions of Corollary [\ref=application], there exists an example such that - KB is not ample.

Example.   Let Ei be an elliptic curve. We consider the abelian 6-fold [formula]. Let G be the finite subgroup of [formula] generated by

[formula]

where ζn means a n-th root of unity. Then the quotient Z: =  / G satisfies the conditions Theorem [\ref=main] and it admits a fibration Z  →  (E1  ×  E3  ×  E5) / G. By direct calculation, [formula].
