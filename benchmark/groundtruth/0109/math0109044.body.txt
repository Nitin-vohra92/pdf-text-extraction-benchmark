On a [formula]-maximal curve of genus [formula]

Introduction

Let X be a projective, geometrically irreducible, non-singular algebraic curve of genus g defined over the finite field [formula] of order q2. The curve X is called [formula]-maximal if it attains the Hasse-Weil upper bound on the number of [formula]-rational points; i.e., if one has

[formula]

Maximal curves are known to be very useful in Coding Theory [\cite=goppa] and they have been intensively studied by several authors: see e.g. [\cite=sti-x], [\cite=vdG-vdV], [\cite=ft1], [\cite=fgt1], [\cite=ft2], [\cite=chkt], [\cite=gt1], [\cite=g-sti-x], [\cite=kt1], [\cite=kt2]. The subject of this paper is related to the following basic questions:

For a given power q of a prime, which is the spectrum of the genera g of [formula]-maximal curves?

For each g in the previous item, how many non-isomorphic [formula]-maximal curves of genus g do exist?

Write down an explicit [formula]-plane model for each of the curves in the previous item.

Ihara [\cite=ihara] observed that g cannot be arbitrarily large compared with q2. More precisely,

[formula]

Rück and Stichtenoth [\cite=rueck-sti] showed that (up to [formula]-isomorphism) there is just one [formula]-maximal curve of genus g1, namely the Hermitian curve of equation

[formula]

On the other hand, if g < g1, then

[formula]

(see [\cite=sti-x], [\cite=ft1]) and, up to [formula]-isomorphism, there is just one [formula]-maximal curve of genus g2 which is obtained as the quotient of the Hermitian curve by a certain involution (see [\cite=fgt1], [\cite=at1], [\cite=kt2]). Now if g < g2, then (see [\cite=kt2])

[formula]

and this bound is sharp as examples in [\cite=g-sti-x], [\cite=kt1], and [\cite=ckt2] show. These examples arise as quotient curves of the Hermitian curve by a certain automorphism of order three; however it is not known whether or not such curves are [formula]-unique. In view of the results stated above and taking into consideration the examples in [\cite=ckt1], [\cite=ckt2] and [\cite=g-sti-x], it is reasonable to expect that only few (non-isomorphic) [formula]-maximal curves do exist having genus g close to the upper bound g1 provided that q is fixed. As a matter of fact, in the range

[formula]

the following statements hold:

If [formula], there exists an [formula]-maximal curve of genus g = g3 - 1; see [\cite=ckt1] and [\cite=g-sti-x]. Such a curve is also the quotient of the Hermitian curve by a certain automorphism of order three and it is also not known whether this curve is unique or not;

If [formula] and q  ≥  11, there is just one [formula]-maximal curve (up to [formula]-isomorphism) of genus (q - 1)(q - 2) / 6, namely the non-singular model of the affine plane curve yq + y = x(q + 1) / 3, see [\cite=kt2];

If [formula] with q  ≥  13, there is no [formula]-maximal curve of genus (q - 1)(q - 2) / 6, loc. cit.;

If q = 3t, t  ≥  1, there exists an [formula]-maximal curve of genus g = q(q - 3) / 6, namely the non-singular model (over [formula]) of the affine plane curve

[formula]

We observe that different values of a in ([\ref=eq1.2]) define just one [formula]-maximal curve (up to [formula]-isomorphism); see Remark [\ref=rem4.1].

In this paper, motivated by the questions and the results above, we investigate the uniqueness (up to [formula]-isomorphism) of the [formula]-maximal curve in statement (IV). Our main result is Theorem [\ref=thm4.1], where we show that such a curve is either a non-reflexive space curve of degree q + 1, or it is uniquely determined (up to [formula]-isomorphism) by the Artin-Schreier relation ([\ref=eq1.2]). Unfortunately, we do not know whether or not such a non-reflexive maximal curve can exist (see Remarks [\ref=rem3.1], [\ref=rem3.2], [\ref=rem3.3] and [\ref=rem3.4]).

The key point in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4.1] is the fact that an [formula]-maximal curve of genus q(q - 3) / 6 can be embedded either in [formula] or in [formula] as a curve of degree q + 1. This fact follows from the "natural embedding theorem" [\cite=kt1] combined with Castelnuovo's genus formula ([\ref=eq2.2]). In the former case, the curve is non-reflexive; see Remark [\ref=rem3.3]. In the latter case, the curve is extremal in the sense that its genus coincide with Castelnuovo's number c(q + 1,4); see formula ([\ref=eq2.2]). Several relevant properties of extremal curves are known to be true in positive characteristic thanks to Rathmann's paper [\cite=rathmann]. For our purpose, the relevant result on extremal curves is a remark due to Accola in [\cite=accola]; see Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1] here. It follows then that this extremal [formula]-maximal curve admits a [formula]-rational point whose Weierstrass semigroup H is generated by q / 3 and q + 1 (see Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2]); consequently the curve admits a plane model over [formula] given by Eq. ([\ref=eq4.1]), the so called "generalized Weierstrass normal form associated to H". Further properties of the linear series associated to the embedding of the curve in [formula] (see Section [\ref=s2]) and some tedious computations (which are handled as in [\cite=at1]) complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4.1].

We point out that several examples of non-isomorphic [formula]-maximal curves of genus g  ≈  q2 / 8 are known; see [\cite=chkt] and [\cite=abdon]. We also point out that analogous results to our main theorem have been noticed in [\cite=ag].

As in previous research (see e.g. [\cite=fgt1], [\cite=kt2] and the references therein), the essential tool used here is the approach of Stöhr and Voloch [\cite=sv] to the Hasse-Weil bound applied to the corresponding linear series in the aforementioned "natural embedding theorem" [\cite=kt1].

Preliminaries

Throughout the paper we assume q  ≥  9 since the case q = 3 is trivial. As it is known from [\cite=ft1], any [formula]-maximal curve X is equipped with its [formula]-canonical linear series; namely, the complete simple base-point-free linear series

[formula]

where P0 is an arbitrary [formula]-rational point of X. Two basic properties of D are that it is very ample [\cite=kt1], and the following linear equivalence of divisors [\cite=fgt1]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Frobenius morphism on X relative to [formula]. In particular, the definition of D is independent of P0. To deal with the dimension N of D we use Castelnuovo's genus bound (for curves in projective spaces) which, for a simple linear series grd on X, bounds from above the genus g of the curve by means of Castelnuovo's number c(d,r); i.e., one has

[formula]

ε being the unique integer with 0  ≤  ε  ≤  r - 2 and [formula]; see [\cite=castelnuovo], [\cite=acgh], [\cite=hartshorne], [\cite=rathmann].

For a [formula]-maximal curve of genus g = q(q - 3) / 6, N∈{3,4}.

We have that N  ≥  2 and that N = 2 if and only if X is the Hermitian curve whose genus is g = q(q - 1) / 2 (see [\cite=ft2]). Therefore N  ≥  3. If N  ≥  5, from ([\ref=eq2.2]) and the hypothesis on g we would have q(q - 3) / 6  ≤  (q - 2)2 / 8; so q2  ≤  12, a contradiction.

Next based on the Stöhr and Voloch Theory [\cite=sv], we summarize some properties on Weierstrass Point Theory and Frobenius Orders with respect to the linear series D. Let [formula] and [formula] denote respectively the D-orders and [formula]-Frobenius orders of D. For P∈X, let [formula] be the (D,P)-orders of D, and [formula] the strictly increasing sequence that enumerates the Weierstrass semigroup H(P) at P. We have

[formula]

and nN(P) = q + 1 for [formula] by ([\ref=eq2.1]); furthermore, nN - 1(P) = q for any P∈X ([\cite=fgt1], [\cite=kt2]). We also have the following facts from [\cite=fgt1]:

εN  =  νN - 1 = q;

ν1 = 1 if N  ≥  3;

j1(P) = 1 for any P;

jN(P) = q + 1 if [formula], otherwise jN(P) = q;

If [formula] then the (D,P)-orders are nN(P) - ni(P), [formula]

If [formula] then the elements nN - 1(P) - ni(P), [formula] are (D,P)-orders.

Case N = 3

Let X be a [formula]-maximal curve of genus g = q(q - 3) / 6 and let us keep the notation in Section [\ref=s2]. Then, as we saw in Lemma [\ref=lemma2.1], the dimension N of [formula] is either 3 or 4. In this section we point out some consequences of the former possibility.

If N = 3, then ε2 = 3.

Let S be the [formula]-Frobenius divisor associated to D (cf. [\cite=sv]). Then  deg(S) = (ν1  +  ν2)(2g - 2) + (q2 + 3)(q + 1), where ν1 = 1 and ν2 = q by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2]. For [formula] it is known that (loc. cit.)

[formula]

Moreover, as j2(P)  ≥  ε2, the maximality of X implies  deg(S)  ≥  (ε2 + 1)((q + 1)2 + q(2g - 2))  . Now, suppose that ε2  ≥  4. Then the above inequality becomes

[formula]

which is a contradiction with the hypothesis on g. Thus we have shown that ε2∈{2,3}. If ε2 were 2, from [\cite=ckt1] we would have g  ≥  (q2 - 2q + 3) / 6, which is again a contradiction with respect to g.

If N = 3, then  dim(2D)  ≥  9.

Since 0,1,3,q are D-orders (Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2]), then it is easy to see that 0,1,2,3,4,6,q,q + 1,q + 3,2q are 2D-orders and the result follows.

If N = 3, then there exists a [formula]-rational point P such that n1(P) = q - 2.

We conclude this section with some remarks about the possibility N = 3.

(Related with Weierstrass semigroups) From Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2] and Corollary [\ref=cor3.2] there exists [formula] such that n1(P) = q - 2, n2(P) = q, n3(P) = q + 1; i.e., the Weierstrass semigroup H(P) contains the semigroup

[formula]

whose genus (i.e; [formula]) is equal to (q2 - q) / 6 (see e.g. [\cite=ckt1]). How can we complete H in order to get H(P)? We have to choose q / 3 elements from [formula], and it is easy to see that such elements must belong to the set

[formula]

This set contains q / 3 + 2 elements, so we have to exclude two elements from it. Hence we arrive to the following seven possibilities:

q - 1,2q - 2∉H(P);

q - 1∉H(P) but 2q - 2∈H(P); in this case we have to eliminate one element from the set {q2 - 5q / 3 - 1,q2 - 5q / 3,q2 - 5q / 3 + 1};

q - 1,2q - 2∈H(P); in this case we have to eliminate two elements from the set {q2 - 5q / 3 - 1,q2 - 5q / 3,q2 - 5q / 3 + 1}.

So far, we do not know how an obstruction (for N being equal to 3) might arise from some of the possibilities above.

(Related with the Hermitian curve ([\ref=eq1.1])) Suppose that X is [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve. Then the covering cannot be Galois; otherwise by [\cite=ckt2] the curve would be [formula]-isomorphic to the non-singular model of ([\ref=eq1.2]) and thus N = 4. We recall that there is not known any example of a [formula]-maximal curve [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve by a non-Galois covering.

(Reflexivity, Duality and the Tangent Surface) Recall that we can assume our curve X as being embedded in [formula] by [\cite=kt1]. Hefez [\cite=hefez1] noticed that four cases for the generic contact orders for space curves can occur. Homma [\cite=homma2] realized that all the four aforementioned cases occur and characterized each of them by means of the reflexivity of either the curve X, or the tangent surface Tan(X) associated to it (see also [\cite=homma1]). In our situation (ε2 = 3 and ε3 = q), the maximal curve X is non-reflexive by Hefez-Kleiman Generic Order of Contact Theorem [\cite=hefez-klm]. In addition, Homma's result implies that Tan(X) is also non-reflexive. So far we do not know how to relate the maximality of X to the non-reflexivity of its tangent surface. We mention that techniques analogous to those of [\cite=sv] that work on certain surfaces in [formula] over prime fields is now available thanks to a recent paper by Voloch [\cite=voloch].

(Related to Halphen's theorem) Ballico [\cite=ballico] extended Harris [\cite=harris] and Rathmann [\cite=rathmann] results concerning space curves contained in surfaces of certain degree. For a [formula]-maximal curve X of genus q(q - 3) / 6, with q large enough, Ballico's result implies that X is contained in a surface of degree 3 or 4. On the other hand, suppose that Voloch's approach [\cite=voloch] can be extended to cover the case of surfaces over arbitrary finite fields. Then a conjunction of Ballico and Voloch's result would provide further insights of the curves studied here.

Main Result

Let X be a [formula]-maximal curve of genus g = q(q - 3) / 6 and let us keep the notation in Section [\ref=s2]. We will assume that X is embedded in [formula] as a curve of degree q + 1 (cf. [\cite=kt1]), where N =  dim(D)∈{3,4} by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.1].

We have that either

N = 3 and ε2 = 3; i.e. the curve is a non-reflexive space curve; or

N = 4 and X is [formula]-isomorphic to the non-singular model of the plane curve ([\ref=eq1.2]).

In Case (2), the curve is [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve ([\ref=eq1.1]). To see this we observe that via the automorphism (x,y)  ↦  (x,aqy), with aq - 1 =  - 1, the Hermitian curve admits a plane model of type yq1 - y1 = axq + 1. Then we obtain the curve ([\ref=eq1.2]) via the rational function y: = y31 - y1. In particular, the non-singular model of ([\ref=eq1.2]) is indeed a [formula]-maximal curve by [\cite=lachaud].

Furthermore, the non-singular model of ([\ref=eq1.2]) does not depend on the element a used to define the afin equation. In fact if [formula] define curves as in ([\ref=eq1.2]), then such curves are [formula]-isomorphic by means of the automorphism (x,y)  ↦  (αx,y) with αq + 1 = a1 / a2.

To give the proof of the theorem we need some auxiliary results.

Let us assume N = 4. In this case, the curve X becomes extremal in the sense mentioned in the introduction. The following result is implicitly contained in the proof of Castelnuovo's genus bound ([\ref=eq2.2]) taking into account the Riemman-Roch theorem; see e.g. [\cite=accola].

dim(2D) = 11;

There exists a base-point-free 2-dimensional complete linear series D' of degree 2q / 3 such that [formula] is the canonical linear series of X.

Part (1) of this lemma implies Lemmas 4.2 and 4.4 in [\cite=kt2]:

If j2(P) = 2, then j3(P) = 3;

If [formula] and j2(P) > 2, then j2(P) = (q + 3) / 3, j3(P) = (2q + 3) / 3;

If [formula] and j2(P) > 2, then either j2(P) = q / 3, j3(P) = 2q / 3; or j2(P) = (q - 1) / 2), j3(P) = (q + 1) / 2.

For q = 9, n1(P) = 3 for any [formula]

Let P be a [formula]-rational and set ni: = ni(P). Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2] implies that 0,1,j2 = 10 - n2,j3 = 10 - n1,10 are the D-orders at the point. Then the set of 2D-orders at P must contain the set {0,1,2,j2,j2 + 1,2j2,j3,j3 + 1,j2 + j3,2j3,10,11,j2 + 10,j3 + 10,20} and hence, as dim(2D) = 11 by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1], the result follows.

From now on let us assume q  ≥  27.

The case (3) in Corollary [\ref=cor4.1] cannot occur;

There exists [formula] such that j2(P1) > 2; in this case, n1(P1) = q / 3;

Let P1 be as in (2) and [formula] such that [formula] Then the morphism [formula] is unramified, and [formula] for any [formula]

The D-orders and [formula]-Frobenius orders of D are respectively 0,1,2,3,q and 0,1,2,q.

For P∈X, set ji = ji(P) and ni = ni(P).

(1) We have that {q - n2,q - n1}  ⊆  {1,j2,j3} by Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2](6). Suppose that Case (3) in Corollary. [\ref=cor4.1] occurs.

Case j2 = q / 3, j3 = 2q / 3. Here n1∈{2q / 3,q / 3}; let f∈q2(X) such that [formula], where e  ≥  1 and [formula]. If n1 = 2q / 3, then 3e + 2 is an [formula]-order by ([\ref=eq2.1]). However, as  dim(2D) = 11, the sequence of [formula]-orders is 0,1,2,q / 3,q / 3 + 1,2q / 3,2q / 3 + 1,q,q + 1,4q / 3,5q / 3,2q and thus n1 = q / 3. In this case, arguing as above, 3e + 1 is an [formula]-order which is a contradiction.

Case j2 = (q - 1) / 2, j3 = (q + 1) / 2. From Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1](2) and the hypothesis q  ≥  27, we have that 2j2 + 1 = q is a Weierstrass gap at P (i.e.; [formula]), a contradiction with n3 = q.

(2) If we show that there exists P1∈X such that j2(P1) > 2, then the point P1 will be [formula]-rational by (1). So, suppose that j2(P) = 2 for any P∈X. Let R denote the ramification divisor associated to D (cf. [\cite=sv]). Then the D-Weierstrass points coincide with the set of [formula]-rational points and vP(R) = 1 for [formula] (cf. Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2]). Therefore

[formula]

so that 2g - 2 = (q - 1)(q - 4) / 6, a contradiction. That n1 = q / 3 follows immediately from Corollary. [\ref=cor4.1](2) and Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2](5).

(3)-(4) By ([\ref=eq2.1]) we can assume that P0 satisfies Item (2). Let [formula] be such that [formula] and div∞(y) = (q + 1)P0. Then the sections of D are generated by 1,x,x2,x3,y. Now, if we show that there exists [formula] such that j2(P) = 2 and j3(P) = 3, then (4) follows since εi  ≤  ji(P) and νi - i  ≤  ji(P) - j1(P) (cf. [\cite=sv]). To see that such a point P does exist, we proceed as in [\cite=ft2]. For [formula], write div(x - x(P)) = eP + D - n1P0 with e  ≥  1 and [formula]. Then e,2e,3e are (D,P)-orders and if e > 1, 3e = q + 1, a contradiction as [formula]. Finally, for [formula] we show that [formula]. Let aα: =   #  x- 1(α). Then

[formula]

and hence aα  ≥  q / 3 for any α.

In what follows we will assume that P0 satisfies Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2](2)(3); cf. ([\ref=eq2.1]). Let [formula] such that [formula] and div∞(y) = (q + 1)P0. Let v = vP0 be the valuation at P0, and Di: = Dix the i-th Hasse differential operator on q2(X) with respect to x (see e.g. [\cite=hefez]). We set D: = D1.

v(Dy) = v(xq) =  - q2 / 3.

(cf. [\cite=at1]) Let t be a local parameter at P0; then

[formula]

since by the previous lemma the morphism [formula] is totally ramified at P0 and unramified outside P0 so that div(dx) = (2g - 2)P0.

In what follows, we will use several times the following basic property of v: For [formula] we have that

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4.1]. We already know that either N = 3 or N = 4. If N = 3 the result follows from Remark [\ref=rem3.3].

Let N = 4. The rational functions x and y above are related to each other by an equation over [formula] of type (see e.g. [\cite=kato])

[formula]

where the Ai(x)'s are polynomials in x such that  deg(Ai(x))  ≤  q - 3i, and [formula]. In addition by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2](4) we have a relation of type (cf. [\cite=sv]):

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula] k  ≥  2 and 3jk  ≤  q / 3 we have that A3jk(x) = 0 and [formula]

(Recall that q = 3t.)

We apply induction on j. First we show that Ak(x) = 0 if [formula] and 2  ≤  k  ≤  q / 3. To do that, apply D = D30 to Eq. ([\ref=eq4.1]); so

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose that Ak(x)  ≠  0 for some [formula] and 2  ≤  k  ≤  q / 3. Then v(G) < v(xq) by Corollary [\ref=cor4.2] and thus v(F) = v(GDy). Therefore by property ([\ref=eq4.0]) there exist integers 2  ≤  i0  ≤  q / 3 - 1, [formula] and 1  ≤  j0  ≤  q / 3 - 1 such that v(Ai0(x)yi0 - 1) = v(yj0DAj0(x)), a contradiction as gcd (q / 3,q + 1) = 1. The same argument shows that [formula] and thus the induction for j = 0 is complete.

Let j = 1. The case j = 0 reduces Eq. ([\ref=eq4.1]) to

[formula]

Apply D3 to this equation. We find that

[formula]

with

[formula]

At this point we notice that v(D3y) =  - q2. Indeed, from Eq. ([\ref=eq4.2]) we have that v(D2y - (xq2 - x)D3y) =  - q3 / 3 - q2 and so it is enough to see that v(D2y) >  - q3 / 3 - q2. This inequality easily follows by applying D2 to Eq. ([\ref=eq4.3]) and by using property ([\ref=eq4.0]) once more. Now the case j = 1 follows as in the previous case.

Finally, the case j implies the case j + 1 (with j  ≥  1) is even easier than the previous cases since D3j + 1y = 0 by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2](4).

Therefore Eq. ([\ref=eq4.1]) becomes

[formula]

where A0(x) is a polynomial in x of degree at most q, and where each [formula]. Let [formula]. By using maps of type (x,y)  ↦  (x + a,y) and (x,y)  ↦  (x,ax + y) we can assume that B1 = Bq = 0. We can also assume that B0 = 0 by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2](3). Moreover, it is easy to see that the property: D3iy = 0 for [formula] (cf. Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2](4)), reduces A0(x) to

[formula]

Next from Eq. ([\ref=eq4.4]) we see that the rational functions Dy, D2y and D3y are polynomials in x. From Eq. ([\ref=eq4.2]) we conclude then that yq2 - y is a polynomial in x which is a multiple of xq2 - x by Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2](3). Therefore

Bi = 0 for each i, and

[formula] for [formula].

Now it is easy to see that there exists [formula] such that A3 / A31 = a2 and such that aq - 1 =  - 1. Finally, we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4.1] via the map (x,y)  ↦  (x,aA1y).
