Diagonalization of compact operators in Hilbert modules over C*-algebras of real rank zero

Introduction

Let A be a C*-algebra. We consider Hilbert A-modules over A [\cite=pa1], i.e. (right) A-modules M together with an A-valued inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉:M  ×  M  →  A satisfying the following conditions:

〈x,x〉  ≥  0 for every x∈M and 〈x,x〉 = 0 iff x = 0,

〈x,y〉  =  〈y,x〉* for every x,y∈M,

〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 is A-linear in the second argument,

M is complete with respect to the norm [formula].

By [formula] we denote the A-module dual to M. Let [formula] be a right Hilbert A-module of sequences a = (ak), ak∈A, [formula] such that the series [formula] converges in A in norm with the standard basis {ek} and let [formula] be a submodule generated by the elements [formula] of the basis. An inner A-valued product on module [formula] is given by [formula] for x,y∈A. A bounded operator [formula] is called compact [\cite=ka] [\cite=mf], if it possesses an adjoint operator and lies in the norm closure of the linear span of operators of the form θx,y, θx,y(z) = x〈y,z〉, [formula]. From now on we suppose that the compact operator K is strictly positive, i.e. operator 〈Kx,x〉 is positive in A and [formula]. It is known [\cite=pa2] that in the case when A is a W*-algebra the inner product can be naturally prolonged to the dual module [formula].

Definition 1.1.  Let A be a W*-algebra. We call an operator K diagonalizable if there exist a set {xi} of elements in [formula] and a set of operators λ∈A such that

{xi} is orthonormal, 〈xi,xj〉  =  δij,

[formula] coincides with the A-module M* dual to the module M generated by the set {xi},

Kxi = xiλi,

for any unitaries ui,  ui + 1∈A we have an operator inequality

[formula]

We call the elements xi "eigenvectors" and the operators λi "eigenvalues" for the operator K. It must be noticed that the "eigenvectors" and "eigenvalues" are defined not uniquely.

The problem of diagonalizing operators in Hilbert modules was initiated by R. V. Kadison in [\cite=kad] and was studied in different settings in [\cite=gp],[\cite=mur],[\cite=fm],[\cite=st] etc. In [\cite=man1],[\cite=man2] we have proved the following

Theorem 1.2. If A is a finite σ-finite W*-algebra then a compact strictly positive operator K can be diagonalized and its "eigenvalues" are defined uniquely up to unitary equivalence.

It is well known that in the commutative case, i.e. for C = C(X) being a commutative C*-algebra, compact operators cannot be diagonalized inside HC but it becomes possible if we pass to a bigger module over a bigger W*-algebra L∞(X)  ⊃  C. It leads us to the following

Definition 1.3. Let C be a C*-algebra  admitting a weakly dense inclusion in a finite σ-finite W*-algebra A and let K be a compact strictly positive operator in HC. We can naturally extend K to the bigger module [formula] where it will remain compact and strictly positive and by the theorem 1.2 it can be diagonalized in this module. We call a C*-algebra  C admitting weak diagonalization if the diagonal entries for any K in [formula] can be taken from C instead of A.

Problem. Describe the class of C*-algebra s admitting weak diagonalization.

Throughout this paper we denote by A a finite σ-finite W*-algebra. Denote by Z = C(Z) the center of A and by T the standard exact center-valued trace defined on A, [formula]. Suppose that for a C*-subalgebra B of A the following condition holds:

for any two projections p,q∈B there exist in B equivalent (in B) projections rp  ~  rq, rp  ≤  p, rq  ≤  q such that T(rp) = T(rq) =  min {T(p)(z),T(q)(z)}, z∈Z.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the class of C*-algebra s admitting weak diagonalization contains real rank zero weakly dense C*-subalgebras of finite σ-finite W*-algebras with the property (). Recall that real rank zero (RR(B) = 0) means [\cite=bp] that every selfadjoint operator in B can be approximated by operators with finite spectrum, i.e. having the form [formula], where pi∈B are selfadjoint mutually orthogonal projections and [formula]. By [\cite=bp] we have in this case also [formula].

Continuity of "eigenvalues"

For the further we need to establish some continuity properties of the "eigenvalues" of compact operators in modules over W*-algebras.

Lemma 2.1. Let [formula], [formula] be strictly positive operators in Ln(A) with finite spectrum and let ||K1  -  K2||  <  ε. Then

one can find a unitary U in Ln(A) such that it maps the "eigenvectors" of K2 to the "eigenvectors" of K1 and ||U*K1U - K2||  <  ε,

"eigenvalues" {λ(r)i} of operators Kr (r = 1,  2) can be chosen in such a way that ||λ(1)i  -  λ(2)i||  <  ε.

Proof. As the algebra A can be decomposed into a direct integral of finite factors, so it is sufficient to prove the lemma for the case when A is a type II1 factor (for type In factors lemma is trivial). Denote by [formula] the spectral projection for the operator K corresponding to the set ( -   ∞  ,λ). If τ is an exact finite trace on A, it can be prolonged to the (infinite) trace [formula] on the algebra [formula] and to the finite trace on a lesser algebra [formula] where we have [formula]. Put

[formula]

As it is shown in [\cite=mn] (the continuous minimax principle) one has

[formula]

where (  ·  ,  ·  ) denotes an inner product in a Hilbert space where the algebra [formula] is represented and P denotes the set of projections in [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=eps]) that if ||K1  -  K2||  <  ε, then

[formula]

Let Q(r)i be projections on the "eigenvectors" x(r)i of the operators Kr, corresponding to the maximal "eigenvalues" λ(r)i, (Q(r)i) = 1. For two divisions {P(1)l,Q(1)i} and {P(2)l,Q(2)i} of unity given by decompositions of K1 and K2 we can construct a finer division of unity. By [\cite=tak] there exist sets of mutually orthogonal projections [formula] such that

[formula],

(R(1)m) = (R(2)m),

for every m we have R(r)m  ≤  Q(r)i or R(r)m  ≤  P(r)j for some i or j.

Then (after renumbering) one can write the operators Kr in the form [formula] with [formula], α(r)m∈. It makes possible to define a unitary U:Ln(A)  →  Ln(A) such that

[formula]

hence [formula] so U maps the A-modules generated by the "eigenvectors" x(2)i into the modules generated by x(1)i, hence Ux(2)i = x(1)i  ·  ui  =  x̄(1)i for some unitaries ui∈A. Put

[formula]

Then εKr(α)  =  α(r)n(α) and it follows from ([\ref=eps2]) that |α(1)n(α)  -  α(2)n(α)|  <  ε. But changing α we obtain that

[formula]

for all m. Taking α = 1 (then i = 1) we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=U]) and ([\ref=eps3]) we conclude that

[formula]

Choosing appropriate λ(r)1 to satisfy the conditions Λ(1)1x̄(1)1  =  x̄(1)1λ(1)1 and Λ(2)1x(2)1 = x(2)1λ(2)1 we obtain the estimate

[formula]

By the same way estimates ([\ref=a]), ([\ref=b]) can be obtained for all i and it proves the lemma.[formula]

Corollary 2.2. Let [formula], r = 1,  2 be compact strictly positive operators and let ||K1  -  K2||  <  ε. Then

one can find a unitary U in [formula] such that it maps the "eigenvectors" of K2 to the "eigenvectors" of K1 and ||U*K1U - K2||  <  ε,

"eigenvalues" {λ(r)i} of operators Kr (r = 1,  2) can be chosen in such a way that ||λ(1)i  -  λ(2)i||  <  ε.

Proof. Let [formula] denotes the Hilbert submodule generated by the first n "eigenvectors" of the operator Kr, [formula]. It was shown in [\cite=man2] that the orthogonal complement to such submodule is isomorphic to [formula] and the norm of restriction of compact operator Kr on the orthogonal complement to L(r)n(A) in [formula] tends to zero, henceforth it is sufficient to consider only the case of operators in Ln(A) and there one can approximate these operators by operators with finite spectrum.[formula]

Case of RR(B) = 0

In this section we show that C*-algebra s of real rank zero with the property () admit weak diagonalization.

Theorem 3.1. Let B be a weakly dense C*-subalgebra in A with the property () and let RR(B) = 0. If K is a compact strictly positive operator in the B-module [formula] then the "eigenvalues" {λi} of diagonalization of the natural prolongation of K to the A-module [formula] can be chosen in a way that λi∈B would hold.

Proof is based on the results of S. Zhang [\cite=zh]. By [\cite=bp],[\cite=zh] the operator K can be approximated by operators [formula] with finite spectrum. By [\cite=zh], corollary 3.5 there exist such unitaries [formula] that the operators

[formula]

are diagonal and λ(n)i∈B are operators with finite spectrum. Show that due to the property () by an appropriate choice of such Un one can make the condition ([\ref=ord]) valid for "eigenvalues" {λ(n)i}. Let [formula], [formula] where qk,  rl∈B are projections and suppose that a < b but for some m and n inequality βm  >  αn holds. Using the possibility to diagonalize projections [\cite=zh] we can find projections sl∈B equivalent to rl and such that [formula] and s(l)k  ≤  qk. Then put

[formula]

[formula]

and notice that the operators [formula] and [formula] are unitarily equivalent. After repeating this procedure for all cases when βl  >  αk we obtain validity of ([\ref=ord]) for λ'a and λ'b. By the same way we can order all "eigenvalues" of Kn remaining in B. But by the property () if ||Kn  -  Kn - 1||  <  εn then one can find such unitaries ui,n in B that

[formula]

. Then u*i,nλ(n)iui,n∈B. Taking a subsequence of {Kn} if necessary we can take in ([\ref=en]) [formula]. Then the sequence

[formula]

is fundamental in B. Denote its limit by i∈B. By the corollary 2.2 for all Kn we can find unitaries Un which map the first n "eigenvectors" of K to "eigenvectors" of Kn. Put [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

and ||K'n  -  K||  →  0. Taking limit in ([\ref=n]) we obtain Kxi = xii, hence i are "eigenvalues" of K.[formula]

Notice that the condition () is necessary for a C*-algebra to have the weak diagonalization property. Indeed if K is a direct sum of two projections, [formula] then the "eigenvalues" of K can be ordered only if the "common part" of 1 - p and q lies in B.

Remark. In the case of C*-algebra s [formula] of irrational rotation one has [formula] (cf [\cite=ce]) and the property () is valid, so the theorem 3.1 gives the answer to the problem of [\cite=man2] where we have considered the Schrödinger operator in magnetic field with irrational magnetic flow. It is known that this operator can be viewed as an operator acting in a Hilbert [formula]-module. As we can imbed [formula] in a type II1 factor A as a weakly dense subalgebra [\cite=br] so we can diagonalize this operator in a Hilbert A-module. The present paper shows that the "eigenvalues" of this operator can be chosen to be elements of [formula]. So this situation is a noncommutative analogue of the case θ = 1 when the corresponding operator can be diagonalized over W*-algebra [formula] but the diagonal elements lie in a lesser C*-algebra [formula]. Notice that in case of rational θ this operator is also diagonalizable.
