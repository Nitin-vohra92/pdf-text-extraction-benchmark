Study of the Decoupling of Heavy Fermions in a Z2 Scalar-Fermion Model

Introduction

The decoupling theorem [\cite=ACC] says that when a particle has a mass much higher than the physical scale, it will have very small influence (e.g. radiative corrections) on the "physical world". However, it can be easily seen at one-loop level that the contribution of the particle to renormalized quantities of other particles will not be suppressed by its huge mass if its mass is generated from the Yukawa coupling, i.e. if its mass is generated through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). This is the so-called phenomenon of nondecoupling.

Nondecoupling of heavy fermions in theories with SSB has been discussed in several papers [\cite=LC] [\cite=DEC] [\cite=AP]. Until last year, all arguments were within (one-loop) perturbation theory (except in [\cite=AP] where large-N expansion was used). Nondecoupling beyond one-loop was still not clear and should be explored.

Recently, we studied this issue in a nonperturbative way in a U(1) scalar-fermion model with explicit mirror-fermions [\cite=LL1]. There, we ignore the gauge field assuming that this approximation will not change the picture qualitatively. Hence, the scalar field is our "physical world". The relevant quantity to measure to decide decoupling or not is the ratio of the two renormalized Yukawa couplings: One is the usual renormalized coupling defined as the renormalized (mirror-)fermion mass divided by the renormalized vacuum expectation value (VEV); the other is obtained from the fermion-fermion-scalar 3-point vertex function. In the weak coupling regime, one-loop calculation shows that the ratio of the two is very close to one. As the bare Yukawa coupling gets stronger, the renormalized Yukawa coupling defined from the mass-to-VEV ratio is no longer a good definition for the renormalized coupling. There, we need to define the renormalized coupling from the appropriate 3-point vertex function. If the ratio of the two Yukawa couplings (denoted by R) still remains 1.0, we take it as the indication for the nondecoupling of the heavy (mirror-)fermion.

Our main results in [\cite=LL1] are:

(i) Up to the strong Yukawa coupling regime, the ratio R for the mirror-fermion is always equal to 1.0 within the error, indicating that the heavy mirror-fermion does have its renormalized Yukawa coupling proportional to the mass and will not decouple from the transverse component of the scalar field. Thus one-loop picture survives the strong Yukawa coupling limit. The idea of decoupling the mirror partners by giving them large masses does not work.

(ii) Since the action of the model has a symmetry between fermion and mirror-fermion , it is obvious that the heavy fermion itself will not decouple either.

(iii) Our data also show that all doublers decouple as expected.

(iv) We think that these conclusions also apply to the SU(2) version of the mirror-fermion model because its qualitative behaviour appears to be similar to that of the U(1) model [\cite=FLMMPTW].

(v) We conjecture that in other scalar-fermion models, heavy fermions do not decouple either.

In order to confirm our conjecture mentioned in (v), we carried out Monte Carlo simulations on a 4-dimensional Z2 scalar field theory coupled to the staggered fermion. We now report on our results in this letter.

Action and Renormalized Quantities

The lattice action of the 4-dimensional Z2 scalar-fermion model with staggered fermions is

where φx is the scalar field with only one real component, χx and x are the one-component staggered fermion fields, ηx,μ being the phase factor associated with staggered fermions, ηx,1 = 1 and [formula] for 2  ≤  μ  ≤  4, Sint represents the term for the Yukawa interaction. In this report, we study the model with the so-called "non-overlapping" Yukawa coupling introduced in [\cite=BHHK]. Hence,

Phase Structure and Numerical Simulation

The phase structure of the model defined in eq.([\ref=eq01]) at λ = 0.01 has been explored and was presented in figure 2 of [\cite=BHHK]. At G = 0, the model reduces to a one-component pure scalar λφ4 theory which has FM, symmetric (PM) phases and an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phase. At λ = 0.01, the transition point between FM and PM phases occurs around κ = 0.120 and is a Gaussian fixed point. Due to the symmetry: φx  →  ( - 1)xφx,κ  →   - 1κ, the transition between PM and AFM phases occurs around κ =  - 0.120. As G is gradually turned on, the FM-PM phase transition occurs at smaller and smaller (and eventually negative) κ values because dynamical fermions favour the FM phase. This feature has been observed in all scalar-fermion models studied so far [\cite=BHHK] [\cite=ALL]. As the value of G is further increased, some new phase, like the ferrimagnetic (FI) phase, shows up and the phase structure will be (slightly) dependent on the model [\cite=ALL]. For the Z2 scalar-fermion model investigated in this letter, the FI phase and a new PM phase were found at strong and infinite G [\cite=BHHK]. Around G = 1.7, there is a point (called point B in [\cite=BHHK], and will be called as such from now on) around which four phases (FM, PM, AFM and FI) may coexist. We have explored the phase structure around that point B on 43  ·  8 lattice, and find that point B is located around G = 1.7 and κ =  - 0.125, consistent with previous estimate [\cite=BHHK] [\cite=JB].

The physically interesting phase transition is the one between the FM and PM (called S1 in [\cite=BHHK]) phases (curve AB in figure 2 of [\cite=BHHK]). It was found to be consistent with a second-order phase transition on which the cutoff can be removed. We therefore carry out Monte Carlo simulations at λ = 0.01 in the FM phase, but in the vicinity of this FM-PM phase transition line.

In the simulations, besides λ = 0.01, we set G to be 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.8. The lattices we use are 84 and 124. We then tune the scalar mass parameter κ to have mR around 1.0 on 84 lattice to reduce finite size effects and at the same time maintain a reasonable cutoff.

In this Z2 scalar-fermion model, no continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken in the FM phase, so there is no massless particle in the spectrum. Finite size effects should be small except on small lattices where vacuum tunnelings happen. It is well known that on a finite lattice, the ground state is nondegenerate. This means that there is no SSB on a finite lattice. The unique ground has a vanishing VEV and is a symmetric linear combination of two states, which are peaked at the positive and negative minima respectively. It is these two states that will converge to the two degenerate ground states in the thermodynamic limit [\cite=GM]. Once tunnelings happen on a finite lattice, we will be in the nondegenerate ground state of the system. Finite size effects will be dominated by an instanton-like equation [\cite=GM] and may not be small on small lattices. If the system is not too close to criticality such that it is trapped in one of the minima, then finite volume effects will be dominated by perturbative effects rather than tunneling. In the presence of dynamical fermions, the precision of our data will not be good enough. To analyze finite size effects dominated by tunnelings is therefore too demanding for the moment. So, when we study the properties of the FM phase of the model on a finite lattice and eventually extrapolate to get the infinite volume limit, we actually do not wish to see tunneling events.

Without loss of generality in our simulations, we always set up the initial condition such that the system starts in the positive minimum. We define the time-slice average of the scalar field as

[formula]

By observing values of those φs(t), we will know whether tunnelings happen or not.

The Monte Carlo simulations are performed by the unbiased Hybrid Monte Carlo method [\cite=HBMC]. Therefore, the fermions have to be doubled by taking the adjoint of the fermion matrix for the second species. (The fermionic part in eq.([\ref=eq01]) is given for a single species of staggered fermions.) We will have eight degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum limit. The number of leapfrog steps per molecular dynamics trajectory was chosen randomly between 3 and 10. The step size was tuned to maintain an acceptance rate around 75%. The necessary inversions of the fermion matrix were done by the conjugate gradient iteration, until the residuum was smaller than some small value times the length square of the input vector. We find that this value has to be 10- 12 on the 84 and 124 lattices. We use Creutz observable exp( - δH) to decide whether the system has equilibrated or not [\cite=MC] where δH is the difference between the new and old Hamiltonians in the Hybrid Monte Carlo update. In equilibrium, we should have

Conclusion and Discussion

Our numerical data are presented in table 1. Our data on the renormalized fermion mass and bare VEV at G =  1.2 and 1.8 agree with those published in [\cite=BHHK]. We also find that the renormalized fermion mass has the mean field behaviour μR = G〈|φ|〉. The renormalized fermion mass presented here can be as high as 700 to 800 GeV at strong Yukawa couplings. (The physical scale is set by vR  =  246 GeV.) At all points where we did simulations, no vacuum tunneling events were observed. We think this is partly due to the fact that dynamical fermions tend to increase the height of the barrier between the two minima. It is also because Hybrid Monte Carlo is a local updating algorithm. (In the presence of dynamical fermions, we cannot use cluster algorithms to perform global updates.) Thus it is not easy for the system to tunnel even on an 83 spatial lattice.

According to table 1, data on R from G = 0.1 to 1.2 are all consistent with 1.0 within errors, indicating a universal behaviour of the nondecoupling of heavy fermions as expected.

However, at G = 1.8, κ =  - 0.04, data on R on 84 lattice (i.e. point g in table 1) is clearly smaller than 1.0 by several standard deviations, while data on 124 lattice are too noisy to tell. Therefore, we cannot be certain whether heavy fermions are still coupled to the scalar field at G = 1.8. At the moment, we would like to say that there could be a possibility that heavy fermions do decouple as the decoupling theorem says, although their masses are totally generated from Yukawa coupling. (In the action of our model, we do not have a bare fermion mass term.) This possibility exists because points f, F, g, G in table 1 are lying slightly to the right of point B and may very well be affected by it. Since point B might be a multi-critical point and may have, in principle, renormalization properties different from those dictated by the Gaussian fixed point at G = 0, it should not be too surprising that heavy fermions decouple in the vicinity of point B. Besides, if we stay at G = 1.8 and keep reducing the value of κ, we will be approaching the phase transition line between the FM and FI phases. This FM-FI transition line is the place where bare VEV is still nonzero. Thus, it should not be a physically relevant phase transition line.

At this point, we would like to conclude that at least along the phase transition line between the FM and PM phases from G = 0.1 to G = 1.2 where the system is still governed by the infrared stable Gaussian fixed point at G = 0, heavy fermions whose masses are totally generated by the Yukawa coupling do not decouple. One-loop picture is qualitatively correct throughout this region. Although data presented in this letter are at λ = 0.01, we believe that the above conclusion holds at all values of λ between zero and infinity. As we go to even stronger Yukawa coupling where a possible multi-critical point may come into play, the decoupling of heavy fermions remains a possibility. However, our present data cannot give a conclusive signal for decoupling. Whether heavy fermions really decouple or not there depends on the properties of that possible multi-critical point. Due to limited computer resources, this issue will be left for the future study.
