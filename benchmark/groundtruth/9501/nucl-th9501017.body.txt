The strength of final state interaction (FSI) between struck proton and spectator neutron in [formula] scattering depends on the alignment of the deuteron. We study the resulting FSI effects in the tensor analyzing power in detail and find substantial FSI effects starting at still low missing momentum [formula]. At larger [formula], FSI completely dominates both missing momentum distribution and tensor analyzing power. We find that to a large extent FSI masks the sensitivity of the tensor analyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function. For the transversely polarized deuterons the FSI induced forward-backward asymmetry of the missing momentum distribution is shown to have a node at precisely the same value of pm as the PWIA missing momentum distribution. The position of this node is not affected by FSI and can be a tool to distinguish experimentally between different models for the deuteron wave function.

Introduction

The deuteron being the simplest nucleus, the experimental study of the short distance (i.e. large momentum) behaviour of the deuteron wave function is of particular importance for understanding the short range properties of the nuclear forces. The 2H(e,e'p) scattering at large Q2 and large missing momentum is one of the reactions with potential sensitivity to the short-range structure of the deuteron. Indeed, in the PWIA (plane wave impulse approximation) the 2H(e,e'p) cross section is well known to probe the deuteron ground state momentum distribution [formula], since in PWIA the missing momentum [formula] can be identified with the initial pn relative momentum [formula] (for a review see [\cite=frulmo]). However, this simple relation between the deuteron wave function and the missing momentum distribution is affected by final state interaction (FSI) between the struck proton and the spectator neutron. Despite the deuteron being a very dilute target, in our recent study [\cite=deu] of unpolarized 2H(e,e'p) scattering at large Q2, we showed that FSI effects overwhelmed the PWIA distribution at pm [formula] 1.5 fm- 1. (A similar effect was found for 4He [\cite=hel] and heavier nuclei [\cite=4] [\cite=5].) There is a basic necessity to disentangle the short-distance and/or large relative momentum wave function of the deuteron and to this end, one can think of exploiting the tensor polarization of the deuteron. Indeed, due to the mixing of the S- and D-wave components by the tensor nuclear forces, the probability of FSI between the struck proton and the spectator neutron depends on the alignment (tensor polarization) of the deuteron. (Hereafter the polarization axis is chosen along the (e,e') momentum transfer [formula], while θ is the angle between [formula] and [formula].) Similar sensitivity to tensor polarization of the double scattering amplitude in elastic p - [formula] scattering was discussed earlier [\cite=harri] [\cite=fragla]. The 2H(e,e'p) experiments with both polarized and unpolarized deuterons constitute an important part of the program at CEBAF [\cite=cebaf]. The tensor analyzing power can also be measured in the [formula] reaction on the polarized deuteron jet target in the HERMES experiment at HERA [\cite=hera].

If only the deuteron is polarized, a key measurable quantity is the tensor analyzing power

[formula]

where σμ is the cross section for the polarization state of the deuteron μ  =    ±  1,0 and we use the property σ+  =  σ-. By definition,  - 2  ≤  A  ≤  1, the limits being saturated when σ+  =  0 and σo  =  0, respectively. Already in PWIA the tensor analyzing power A is nonzero, as the D-wave admixture in the deuteron produces the tensor polarization dependent deviations from the spherical shape of the deuteron wave function. The interest in A stems from the potential sensitivity to the not so well known D-wave component of the deuteron and from the possibility of discrimination among different models for the deuteron ground state. For the same reason of the deviation from a spherically symmetric shape, the probability of FSI also depends on the tensor polarization: at large [formula] the struck proton flies in the direction of [formula], the probability of interaction with the spectator neutron is higher if the deuteron is aligned along [formula] and the alignment depends on the tensor polarization. Consequently, the interpretation of the experimental data on the tensor analyzing power requires a quantitative understanding of FSI effects.

In this paper we present a detailed Glauber theory description of FSI effects in the [formula] scattering on tensor polarized deuterons. In section 2 we discuss PWIA predictions for the tensor analyzing power. Interpretation of the rich structure of the tensor analyzing power in terms of nodal properties and interference of the S- and D-wave amplitudes is presented in section 3. We point out a potential sensitivity of the tensor analyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function. In section 4 we introduce the Glauber theory description of FSI and describe FSI modifications of S- and D-wave amplitudes, in section 5 we present our main results for FSI effects. We find strong FSI, which leads to complex modifications of the tensor analyzing power and of the missing momentum distribution for different polarizations of the deuteron. FSI effects are particularly strong at large pm and are an important background to the extraction of properties of the short-distance np interaction. Still another FSI effect - the forward-backward asymmetry of the missing momentum distribution - is discussed in section 6. Remarkably, this forward-backward asymmetry probes a nodal structure of certain undistorted S- and D-wave amplitudes which is free of uncertainties from FSI. In the conclusions section we summarize our main results. Numerically, FSI effects in the tensor analyzing power turn out to be substantial already at pm [formula] (0.9-1.0)fm- 1 and to a large extent mask the potential sensitivity to models of the deuteron wave function.

Tensor analyzing power in plane wave impulse approximation

In this communication we would like to concentrate on FSI effects and to focus on the simpler case of the longitudinal response. For this case, the photon can be treated as a scalar operator which does not change the spin state of the proton and the neutron (for the full hadronic tensor in deuteron scattering, see [\cite=arhoe]). Then, factorizing out the electromagnetic current matrix element of the struck proton, the reduced nuclear amplitude for the exclusive process 2H(e,e'p)n is given by [\cite=frulmo] [\cite=deforest] [\cite=boffi]

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] [formula],  [formula] is the wave function for the deuteron spin state μ and χν stands for the spin wave function of the final pn state. The struck proton is detected with momentum [formula],  [formula] is the (e,e') momentum transfer and [formula] [formula] [formula] is the missing momentum. [formula] is the S-matrix of FSI between the struck proton and the spectator neutron, which describes the distortion of the outgoing waves. The subscript ν is a reminder that the np interaction in the final state may depend on the spin state. The observed momentum distribution corresponding to a given deuteron polarization μ is the sum [formula]. The deuteron wave function for states μ  =    ±  ,0 is [\cite=bonn]

[formula]

[formula]

where u / r and w / r are the S and D-wave radial wave functions of the deuteron, with the normalization [formula]. Here, |σ〉 stands for the initial triplet spin wave function with the projection σ  =  0,  ±  1.

It is convenient to introduce the S- and D-wave amplitudes

[formula]

where τ  =  0,  ±  1,  ±  2 and we suppressed the possible weak dependence of the FSI factor [formula] on the relevant spin state |σ〉, see below. In terms of these amplitudes the momentum distributions can be written as

[formula]

In order to set up the framework, we first cite simple results for PWIA, where [formula]. Denoting

Denoting [formula], we have

Also, notice the property

[formula]

which holds because Y2  ±  1(p̂m)  =  0 and therefore [formula] for θ  =  0o,90o,180o and Y2  ±  2(p̂m)  =  0 and therefore [formula] for θ  =  0o,180o.

Nodes of S- and D-wave amplitudes, S-D wave interference and diffractive dip-bump structure in PWIA

The salient features of the PWIA distributions [formula] and the tensor analyzing power [formula] can easily be understood in terms of the pm-dependence of s(pm) and d(pm). For the sake of definiteness, consider transverse kinematics, i.e. [formula]. The separate S- and D-wave function contributions (dotted line and dash-dotted line, respectively) to No(pm,θ  =  90o) (solid line) and N+(pm,θ  =  90o) (solid line) are shown in Figs.1c,d, respectively, for the Bonn potential [\cite=bonn]. Notice a stronger D-wave contribution to N+(pm,θ  =  90o). The total distributions Nμ(pm) include also the S-D interference terms not shown separately. The S-wave amplitude [formula] has a zero at pm  =  p(1)m  =  2.22fm- 1 for the Bonn potential. The D-wave amplitudes [formula] have a kinematical zero at pm  =  0 and are node-free in the considered region of pm. The S- and D-wave amplitudes become comparable at [formula], and the D-wave contribution takes over at larger pm. For the Bonn potential No(pm,θ  =  90o) has a zero at pm  =  p(2)m = 1.58fm- 1 for the destructive interference and exact cancelation of the S-wave and the D-wave contributions, when [formula], see Eq. ([\ref=pwpro3]). At pm  >  p(1)m, the S-D interference in No(pm,θ  =  90o) becomes constructive. The pm-dependence of No(pm,θ  =  90o) and N+(pm,θ  =  90o) is strikingly different. For the constructive S-D interference, N+(pm,θ  =  90o) shown in Fig. 1d exhibits a smooth, structureless decrease with pm. The effect of the dip in the S-wave contribution is completely masked by an overwhelming D-wave contribution. Notice the destructive S-D interference in N+(pm,θ  =  90o) at pm  >  p(1)m.

These properties of s(pm) and d(pm) have simple manifestations in the tensor analyzing power. At pm  →  0 we have APWIA(pm,θ = 90o)  →  0 for the vanishing of the D-wave function d(pm). With increasing pm, APWIA(pm,θ = 90o) (dotted line in Fig.2a) stays positive, and saturates at pm  =  p(2)m the upper bound APWIA(pm,θ = 90o)  =  1, when No(pm,θ = 90o) vanishes. With the further increase of pm, the tensor analyzing power decreases and takes the value [formula] when the S-wave function s(pm) has a node at pm  =  p(1)m  =  2.22fm- 1 for the Bonn potential. Beyond the node, the S-wave function rises in magnitude, leading to a change of sign of APWIA(pm,θ = 90o) at pm  =  p(3)m  =  2.73fm- 1 for the Bonn potential, when [formula].

The position p(2)m of the zero in N0(pm,θ  =  90o) and N±(pm,θ  =  0o,180o), and the position p(3)m of the zero of APWIA(pm,θ = 90o), are a matter of delicate cancelations between the S- and D-wave functions. As such, they are sensitive to the D-wave function, which remains a not so well known quantity in the theory of the deuteron. In Fig. 2a we compare the predictions for APWIA(pm,θ = 90o) from the Bonn and Paris [\cite=paris] wave functions (dotted and dash-dotted curve, respectively). The qualitative behaviour of the results is the same, but for the Paris potential, N0(pm,θ  =  90o) has a zero at a value of p(2)m  =  1.50fm- 1, which is 0.08fm- 1 smaller than for the Bonn wave function. The sensitivity to the model of the wave function increases with pm: for the Paris wave function, the tensor analyzing power changes sign at a value of p(3)m  =  2.52fm- 1, by about 0.2fm- 1 smaller than for the Bonn wave function.

The angular dependence of Nμ(pm,θ) in PWIA for different missing momenta is shown in Fig.3 and the angular distribution of APWIA(pm,θ) is shown by the dotted curve in Fig.4. By virtue of ([\ref=eq:6]) and ([\ref=eq:7]) a minimum in N+ (dotted curve) corresponds to a maximum in No (dashed curve) and vice versa, and N+  =  No at [formula]. By virtue of the definition ([\ref=eq:1]) the sign of the difference between N±(pm,θ) and No(pm,θ) depends on the tensor analyzing power A. For instance, APWIA(pm,θ  =  90o) changes sign at p(3)m  =  2.73fm- 1 (see Figs.2,4) and for pm  >  p(3)m we have N+(pm,θ  =  90o)  <  No(pm,θ  =  90o), whereas for pm  <  p(3)m we have N+(pm,θ  =  90o)  >  No(pm,θ  =  90o), cf. Figs. 3a-e and Fig. 3f. In PWIA, Nμ(pm,θ) are even functions of cos θ, and there is no forward-backward asymmetry: Nμ(pm,θ  =  0o) = Nμ(pm,θ  =  180o).

FSI effects and nodal structure of S- and D-wave amplitudes

FSI effects substantially modify the above pattern. In this work we focus on large [formula] (1-2) GeV2 of interest in the CEBAF experiments, where the kinetic energy of the struck proton Tkin  ≈  Q2 / 2mp is high and FSI can be described by Glauber theory [\cite=glau]. The onset of color transparency effects at the highest Q2 attainable at CEBAF will be discussed elsewhere. Defining transverse and longitudinal components [formula] [formula] [formula], where [formula] denotes the unit vector in z-direction and [formula] is the impact parameter, we can write

[formula]

where [formula] is the profile function of the proton-neutron scattering, which at high energy can conveniently be parameterized as

[formula]

(ρ is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward np elastic scattering amplitude, and b2o is the diffraction slope). The step-function θ(z) in eq.([\ref=eq:3]) tells that the FSI vanishes unless the spectator neutron is in the forward hemisphere with respect to the struck proton. A thorough test of the Glauber theory in the scattering of 2 GeV polarized deuterons on protons has been performed in [\cite=13], higher energy data on elastic pd scattering are discussed in [\cite=14], a generic review on the Glauber theory analysis of nucleon-nucleus scattering is given in [\cite=15]. For the high energy and momentum of struck protons and for the simple case of the longitudinal response considered here, the spin state of the proton and neutron does not change and FSI between struck proton and spectator neutron proceeds in the spin triplet state. What enters the Glauber FSI factor ([\ref=eq:4]) is the np total cross section σ(ν)tot for the triplet state with polarization ν. We can express σ(ν)tot in terms of the conventional longitudinal, ΔσL, and transverse, ΔσT, cross section differences [\cite=biry] [\cite=lll]

[formula]

where pν indicates the probability of the spin state |ν〉, p+  +  p-  +  po  =  1. The pn cross sections for the pure state ν are obtained by putting either p+  +  p- = 1 or po  =  1 in eq. ([\ref=cspin]). The experimental data on ΔσL and ΔσT, reviewed in [\cite=lll], show that ΔσL and ΔσT are [formula] of the unpolarized cross section σo. They exhibit an interesting energy dependence in the region [formula] and tend to decrease at higher Tkin. In principle, the experimental isolation of FSI effects and investigation of their Q2 (Tkin) dependence can shed some light on the energy dependence of σ(ν)tot. Unfortunately, the direct experimental measurements of ρν and of the diffractive slope b2o for pure spin states ν are not yet available. The interplay of FSI and tensor polarization effects leads to a very complex pattern of the (pm,θ) dependence of momentum distributions. In order to emphasize the salient features of FSI effects, here we omit small corrections due to ΔσL,ΔσT and, for the sake of definiteness, consider σtot  ≈  40mb, ρ  ≈   - 0.4 and bo  ≈  0.5fm, appropriate for unpolarized np scattering at Tkin  ~  1GeV (Q2  ~  2GeV2) [\cite=15] [\cite=lll] [\cite=16]. The possibility of using FSI effects to pin down the energy dependence of ΔσL and ΔσT will be discussed elsewhere.

Let us decompose the missing momentum [formula] into the transverse and longitudinal components [formula]. The radius b0 of FSI is much smaller than the radius of the deuteron RD  ~  2fm. Consequently, as compared to u(r) and w(r), the FSI operator [formula] is a "short-ranged" function of [formula] and a "long-ranged" function of z, and this anisotropy of [formula] leads to the angular anisotropy of [formula] [\cite=deu] [\cite=hel]. Another striking effect is the forward-backward asymmetry [formula], which has its origin in the nonvanishing real part of the p-n scattering amplitude ρ  ≠  0. This angular anisotropy of FSI effects leads to quite a complex interplay of FSI and S-D interference, breaking of the PWIA symmetry properties ([\ref=pwpro1]) - ([\ref=pwpro3]) and strong departure from the PWIA law [formula]. A further complication comes from the finite ρ, which, apart from the forward-backward asymmetry leads to complex-valued S- and D-wave amplitudes and to the filling of the dips in [formula].

The gross features of FSI effects can be understood, though, in terms of FSI distortions of the S- and D-wave amplitudes ([\ref=ms],[\ref=md]). The main findings of our previous study of the unpolarized 2H(e,e'p) scattering can be summarized as follows:

Angular anisotropy of the FSI factor ([\ref=eq:3]) leads to an angular dependence of the S- and D-wave amplitudes ([\ref=ms],[\ref=md]) which is different from the PWIA expressions ([\ref=spwia],[\ref=dpwia]).

At small [formula], FSI reduces [formula] by ~  3.5%. In this region of small pm, the FSI reduction is to a good approximation θ- independent. It describes the attenuation of the flux of struck protons due to inelastic np interactions and the flow of events from small to large [formula] due to elastic np rescattering.

Destructive interference between PWIA and FSI components of [formula] produces a node of the real part of [formula], shown by the solid curve in Fig.5, in transverse kinematics, θ  =  90o, at [formula] (for the Bonn wave function). The presence of this node, shown in Fig.5, is solely a consequence of the PWIA-FSI interference, it is not related to the presence of the node in the PWIA amplitude ([\ref=spwia]) at much larger pm  =  p(1)m  =  2.22fm- 1. The position of the node of [formula] in [formula] only weakly depends on the longitudinal component pz of the missing momentum.

At larger [formula], the FSI contribution to [formula] takes over the PWIA amplitude, and leads to a sharp peak at θ  =  90o. This peak has its origin in elastic rescattering of the struck proton on the spectator neutron, which contributes predominantly to θ  =  90o for the reason that in high-energy elastic rescattering the momentum transfer is predominantly a transverse one. Fig.3 shows how this 90o peak builds up with the increase of pm.

Distortion of the D-wave amplitudes [formula] has a certain specifics due to the fact that the radius of pn FSI is much smaller than the radius of the deuteron. For crude estimates, consider the approximation

[formula]

For the presence of [formula] in ([\ref=gamaprox]), FSI contributions to [formula] will be dominated by cos θ  =  1, where Y2  ±  2(θ) = Y2  ±  1(θ)  =  0. This leads to an extra, and very strong kinematical suppression of FSI contributions to [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand, the FSI contribution to [formula] does not have any special suppression and, in close similarity to an S-wave amplitude, the real part of [formula], shown by the dotted curve in Fig.5, develops a node at [formula] (for the Bonn wave function). Compared to [formula], in [formula] and [formula] FSI effects are negligible in the region of [formula] of practical interest. For instance, [formula], shown by the dashed curve in Fig.5 does not develop a node.

Still another striking effect of FSI is a nonvanishing [formula] at [formula], as shown in Fig.5 for θ  =  90o. Indeed, in the momentum space, the FSI contribution can be represented as a convolution of the PWIA amplitude with a certain smearing function. Because of this smearing, [formula]. Because of the kinematical suppression of the PWIA amplitude at small pm, even a weak FSI amplitude which has a sign opposite to that of the PWIA amplitude, leads to a zero of [formula] at small pm. Fig. 5 shows how Re  do(pm,θ  =  90o) develops such a zero at [formula] for θ  =  90o. The nonvanishing D-wave contribution at [formula] when FSI is included is evident also in Figs.1a,b. However, because of the strong inequality [formula] in the vicinity of pm  =  0, it is very difficult to observe this fine structure of the D-wave amplitudes experimentally.

FSI effect on S-D interference and position of diffractive dips

Now we turn to the interpretation of our results in view of the above described properties of FSI. At small [formula], both [formula] and [formula] are dominated by the S-wave contribution and are reduced by ≃7% with respect to the PWIA distributions [formula] and [formula]. Let us again start the discussion of larger pm with the simpler case of [formula] shown by the solid curve in Fig.1a. The S-wave contribution, shown by the dotted line, has a dip at pm  =  p(4)m = 1.37fm- 1 for the node of [formula] (the same dip shows up in [formula] shown by the solid line in Fig.1b). In the PWIA case, the dip of the S-wave contribution to [formula] was located at pm  =  p(1)m = 2.22fm- 1 and its effect on [formula] was barely observable for the overwhelming D-wave contribution. The dip in the S-wave component of [formula] is filled in by the contribution from the imaginary part of the S-wave amplitude. The D-wave component of [formula] (dash-dotted curve in Fig.1a) shows an irregularity at pm  =  p(5)m = 2.87fm- 1 due to the node of [formula]. The possible dip of the D-wave component of [formula] is filled in by a contribution from [formula] (and also by the much smaller FSI components of [formula]). This irregularity is difficult to observe experimentally for the predominant S-wave contribution to Wo(pm,θ  =  90o).

Because of the shift of the zero of [formula] to pm  =  p(4)m  =  1.37fm- 1 compared to p(1)m  =  2.22fm- 1 in the PWIA, the condition [formula] and the resulting dip in [formula] will be met at pm  =  p(7)m  =  1.21fm- 1, a strong shift from p(2)m≃1.58fm- 1 in the PWIA, cf. solid curves in Figs.1a,c. The dip in [formula] is partly filled in by the contribution [formula] (there is also a small effect of interference between [formula] and [formula] and a small contribution from nonvanishing FSI components of d±  1 and d±  2). FSI effects in Wo(pm,θ  =  90o) are very strong and lead to a drastic difference between Wo(pm,θ  =  90o) and the PWIA distribution No(pm,θ  =  90o) starting from a still small missing momentum [formula]. In contrast to Wo(pm,θ  =  90o), FSI effects in W+(pm,θ  =  90o) are much smaller for the reason that the S-D interference is much weaker and constructive. Still, as compared to a structureless and monotonously decreasing PWIA distribution N+(pm,θ  =  90o), the dip in the S-wave contribution leads to a substantial structure in W+(pm,θ  =  90o) shown by the solid curve in Fig1b.

At a sufficiently large [formula], the contribution of elastic rescattering to Wμ(pm,θ  =  90o) admits to a certain extent the probabilistic interpretation. At [formula] the 90o peak in W+(pm,θ  =  90o) is higher than in Wo(pm,θ  =  90o), in agreement with the fact that the alignment of the proton and neutron along the z-axis is stronger for μ  =    ±  1 than for μ  =  0. Indeed, precisely such a sign of the quadrupole deformation follows from the sign of the quadrupole moment of the deuteron [\cite=harri] [\cite=fragla].

The results for the parallel kinematics, [formula], θ  =  0o and θ  =  180o, are shown in Fig.6. At small [formula], FSI amplitudes have been shown [\cite=deu] to be suppressed by a small factor [formula]. For this reason of small FSI effects, W+(pm,θ  =  180o) (dashed curve in Fig.6a) has a shallow dip and W+(pm,θ  =  0o) (solid curve in Fig.6a) has a shoulderlike structure at pm very close to the position of the dip in the PWIA distribution N+(pm,θ  =  0o,180o) (dotted curve) at pm  =  p(2)m  =  1.58fm- 1. Substantial departure from PWIA starts at [formula] and is very strong at higher pm.

In Fig.6a, we present also Wo(pm,θ  =  90o) (dash-dotted curve). A comparison with W+(pm,θ  =  0o) (solid curve) and W+(pm,θ  =  180o) (dashed curve) shows a dramatic breaking of the PWIA symmetry ([\ref=pwpro3]) by FSI effects. Strong breaking of still another PWIA symmetry, [formula], will be discussed in more detail below, in section 6.

In spite of the suppression factors [formula], FSI effects in W+(pm,θ  =  0o,180o) shown in Fig.6a are enhanced for the destructive S-D interference, see eqs. ([\ref=wpexpl], [\ref=w0expl]). In Wo(pm,θ  =  0o,180o) the S-D interference is constructive and consequently, Wo(pm,θ  =  0o) (solid curve) and Wo(pm,θ  =  180o) (dashed curve) are least sensitive to FSI effects. Even so, FSI effects are noticeable already at relatively small [formula], and completely overwhelm Wo(pm,θ  =  0o,180o) at [formula]. Notice that at large [formula] the distributions Wo(pm,θ  =  0o) and Wo(pm,θ  =  180o) exhibit a strong excess over, and decrease very slowly compared to, the PWIA distribution No(pm,θ  =  0o) (dotted curve). The origin of this excess lies in the θ-function which emerges in the idealized form of the Glauber FSI operator ([\ref=eq:4]). For the discussion of the sensitivity of this excess to modifications of the FSI operator ([\ref=eq:4]) for the finite size of the nucleus we refer to [\cite=deu] [\cite=hel].

A comment on the interpretation of the above results in terms of the nuclear transparency ratio [formula] is in order. Only at small pm  ~  0, the result that Tμ(pm,θ)≃0.93  <  1 can be interpreted as a conventional nuclear attenuation. At higher pm, the nuclear transparency ratio has a strongly polarization dependent dip-bump structure. The rich and complex pm and θ dependence of the nuclear transparency Tμ(pm,θ) is evident from the results shown in Fig.3. For instance, in transverse kinematics To(p(7)m,θ  =  90o)  ≪  1, which is followed by a rapid rise of the transparency ratio and an infinite peak To(p(2)m,θ  =  90o)  =    ∞   at the dip of the PWIA distribution No(pm,θ  =  90o). At still larger [formula], in the region dominated by elastic rescattering effects, we find very strong nuclear enhancement (antishadowing) Tμ(pm,θ)  ≫  1 (see also [\cite=hel] [\cite=5]).

The (pm,θ) dependence of the tensor analyzing power naturally follows from the above described properties of the S- and D-wave amplitudes and Wμ(pm,θ). Fig.4 shows a strong departure of A(pm,θ) (solid curve) from the PWIA law [formula]. In the PWIA (dotted curve), the tensor analyzing power has two zeroes at θ  =  90o  ±  35.3o. The results shown in Fig.4 demonstrate how the FSI distortions change both the location and number of zeroes of A(pm,θ). (The origin of the forward-backward asymmetry of A(pm,θ) will be discussed in more detail below.) The pm dependence of A(pm,θ) derives from the pm dependence of the S- and D-wave amplitudes. In contrast to the PWIA case, A(pm,θ) does not vanish at pm  =  0, but numerically |A(pm  =  0,θ)|  ≪  1 and is hardly measurable.

For the sake of definiteness, let us consider in more detail transverse kinematics θ  =  90o. With increasing pm, A(pm,θ) rises and has a maximum at pm  ≈  p(8)m  =  1.19fm- 1, in the region of the dip in Wo(pm,θ  =  90o). In the opposite to APWIA(p(2)m,θ  =  90o) in PWIA, A(p(8)m,θ  =  90o) does not saturate the bound A  =  1. With the further increase of pm, we encounter [formula] at p(9)m  =  1.42fm- 1, very close to the position of the FSI induced node in [formula]. At still higher pm, A(pm,θ  =  90o) has two zeroes. The first zero, at pm  =  p(10)m  =  1.70fm- 1 is the counterpart of the zero at pm  =  p(3)m  =  2.73fm- 1 in PWIA, caused by the cancelation of S- and D-wave amplitudes when [formula]. Such a strong shift of the location of this zero with respect to PWIA is due to the fact that s(pm) changes sign much sooner compared to the PWIA case. Compared to the PWIA case, the exact value of p(10)m is affected also by different distortions of [formula] and by the contribution from [formula], see Eqs. ([\ref=wpexpl],[\ref=w0expl]). The origin of the second zero at pm  =  p(11)m  =  2.46fm- 1 is related to the FSI induced node of [formula] at pm  =  p(5)m  =  2.87fm- 1. The inequality p(11)m  <  p(5)m is an effect of the contribution to A(pm,θ  =  90o) from [formula] (the contribution [formula] is numerically very small), which makes A > 0 at pm  =  p(5)m. At still larger pm, where Wμ(pm,θ = 90o) is dominated by the contribution from elastic np rescattering in the S-wave, the tensor analyzing power is positive, i.e. W+  >  Wo, for the above discussed larger probability of rescattering for μ  =    ±  1.

Comparison of the PWIA results from the Paris and Bonn wave functions in Fig.7 shows a significant sensitivity of Nμ(pm,θ  =  90o) to the model of the deuteron wave function at large momentum. The PWIA tensor analyzing power shown in Fig.2 exhibits similar model dependence at large pm. FSI effects mask this sensitivity to the model of the wave function to a large extent, which naturally derives from the fact that [formula] is a short ranged function compared to the deuteron wave function. For this reason, the FSI component of S- and D-wave amplitudes becomes fairly insensitive to details of the large pm behaviour of the deuteron wave function. For instance, whereas in PWIA No(pm,θ  =  90o) has a dip at p(2)m  =  1.50fm- 1 for the Paris wave function (dashed curve in Fig.7b) and at p(2)m  =  1.58fm- 1 for the Bonn wave function (solid curve in Fig.7b), with allowance for FSI a position of the dip of Wo(pm,θ  =  90o) at pm  =  p(7)m is predicted very close for the Paris (dashed curve in Fig.7a) and Bonn (solid curve in Fig.7a) potentials: p(7)m  =  1.206fm- 1 and p(7)m  =  1.208fm- 1, respectively. This suggests that the actual value of p(7)m is much more sensitive to the strength of the FSI rather than to the wave function. The difference between W+(pm,θ  =  90o) for the Paris (dotted curve in Fig.7a) and the Bonn (dash-dotted curve in Fig.7a) wave functions also becomes marginal compared to the difference between the PWIA distributions shown in Fig.7b. Because the position of the dip in Wo(pm,θ  =  90o) is mostly controlled by FSI in the spin-triplet state with ν  =  0, one can think of using the high-statistics data on [formula] scattering on longitudinal deuterons in transverse kinematics for the evaluation of [formula]. For instance, if FSI is evaluated with σ(o)tot  =  30mb keeping the same value of ρo and b2o (at Tkin≃1GeV the SATURNE data [formula] [\cite=fon]), then the dip is shifted to pm  =  1.264fm- 1 and 1.270fm- 1 for the Paris and Bonn potentials, respectively. This shows that there is a residual model dependence of the dip position and the almost exact coincidence of the values of p(7)m evaluated for the Paris and Bonn potentials with σ(o)tot  =  40mb was somewhat accidental. Still the shift of the dip position from p(7)m≃1.21fm- 1 to p(7)m≃1.27fm- 1 when the np cross section is changed from 40mb to 30mb is substantially larger than the difference between the results for Paris and Bonn potentials. Besides the position of the dip in Wo(pm,θ  =  90o), the large pm behaviour of Wμ(pm,θ  =  90o) is also sensitive to σ(o)tot. Namely, according to [\cite=deu], the height of the θ  =  90o peak in Wμ(pm,θ) is proportional to [formula]. However, large pm behaviour of this peak is also sensitive to the as yet experimentally not measured diffraction slope for scattering in this specific spin state. A more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the dip position and of the elastic rescattering peak to ΔσL, ΔσT, and to values of ρ and b2o for pure spin states |ν〉 goes beyond the scope of the present paper and will be presented elsewhere.

Tensor polarization and forward-backward asymmetry

Above we have seen how FSI masks the effects due to the peculiarities of the unperturbed wave function of the deuteron. It is interesting that the forward-backward asymmetry

[formula]

is a pure PWIA-FSI interference effect caused by the nonvanishing elastic part of the p - n rescattering amplitude and as such is proportional to the PWIA amplitudes. Indeed, compare the amplitudes Mμν(  ±  pm) for a given initial spin state μ at θ  =  0o  (pz  =    +  pm) and θ  =  180o  (pz  =    -  pm). Making use of θ(z) = [formula], where ε(z) is equal to +1 for z  >  0 and -1 for z  <  0, we have (we suppress the spin variables ν,μ,τ)

[formula]

where, using the fact that in our case [formula] is an even function of z,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then one obtains

[formula]

where the sum over τ is a reminder that for the chosen deuteron polarization μ different combinations of [formula] and [formula] enter the matrix element according to Eqs. ([\ref=wpexpl],[\ref=w0expl]). Because of Fs(pm)  →  0 at pm  →  0, see Eq. ([\ref=fsdef]), A(μ)FB vanishes at pm  →  0.

In the generic case, both the S-wave and D-wave amplitudes with τ  =    ±  2,  ±  1,0 contribute to A(μ)FB. The situation greatly simplifies for transverse deuterons, polarized along the z axis, μ  =    ±  1. In this case, D-waves with |τ|  =  1,2 do not contribute to A( + )FB, because the corresponding PWIA amplitudes ([\ref=dpwia]) vanish at θ  =  0o,180o. Consequently, only the term with τ  =  0 contributes to the numerator in ([\ref=afb]), and the relevant PWIA amplitude equals

[formula]

Therefore, we predict that A( + )FB has a node at precisely pm  =  p(2)m and the location of this node is not affected by FSI. This provides a unique possibility of experimental determination of p(2)m, which is important for testing models of the deuteron wave function. The sensitivity to the model of the deuteron is demonstrated in Fig.8b, where we compare A( + )FB, for the Bonn and the Paris wave functions. Notice the very steep pm-dependence of A( + )FB around the node. Eqs. ([\ref=fcdef],[\ref=fsdef]) show that while Fc(pm) decreases with pm, Fs(pm) first rises with pm. As a matter of fact, in spite of the FSI suppression factor [formula], Fs(pm) is quite large in the vicinity of the node and gives rise to a peak in A( + )FB at pm  ≈  1.3fm- 1.

For the longitudinal deuterons, μ  =  0, the corresponding PWIA amplitudes do not have any interesting nodal structure, see Fig.1d, which shows quite a structureless No(pm,θ = 0o,180o) (solid line). Correspondingly, A(0)FB does not exhibit any structure at [formula].

Summary and conclusions

The purpose of the present study has been an analysis of effects of the quadrupole deformation of the deuteron in [formula] scattering on tensor-polarized deuterons. Because FSI is sensitive to alignment of the deuteron, we find strong dependence of FSI effects on tensor polarization of the deuteron, which leads to a very rich pattern of the angular and pm dependence of momentum distributions and tensor analyzing power. In the tensor analyzing power A, FSI effects turn out substantial at a relatively small missing momentum [formula] both in transverse and longitudinal kinematics. In transverse kinematics, for the longitudinal deuteron μ  =  0, we predict that FSI shifts the dip of the momentum distribution from pm  =  1.58fm- 1 to pm  =  1.21fm- 1. For transverse deuterons, μ  =    ±  1, FSI produces a shoulder-like structure in W+(pm,θ  =  90o) as compared to a monotonous decrease of N+(pm,θ  =  90o) in PWIA. At large [formula], the elastic rescattering peak in W+(pm,θ  =  90o) is stronger than in Wo(pm,θ  =  90o), in agreement with the expectation that the experimentally known sign of the quadrupole deformation of the deuteron makes the probability of rescattering of the struck proton on the spectator neutron larger for μ  =    ±  1.

A departure of the nuclear transparency ratio [formula] from unity is small, Tμ(pm,θ)≃0.93, only at small pm  ~  0. At larger pm, in the region of strong PWIA-FSI interference, one finds both Tμ(pm,θ)  ≪  1 and Tμ(pm,θ)  ≫  1. The antishadowing effect Tμ(pm,θ)  >  1 is particularly strong in transverse kinematics.

In PWIA, we find substantial sensitivity of the tensor analyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function at large pm. FSI effects mask this sensitivity to a large extent. A unique observable, which provides an FSI independent probe of the nodal structure of the combination of S- and D-wave functions [formula], is the forward-backward asymmetry A( + )FB for transverse deuterons μ  =    ±  1. The asymmetry A(μ)FB is a pure PWIA-FSI interference effect and has its origin in the nonvanishing real part of the np scattering amplitude. None the less, A( + )FB is shown to be proportional to [formula], and the node of A( + )FB(pm) is predicted to coincide with the node of the PWIA amplitude [formula]. Mention must be made of a potential sensitivity of FSI effects to the spin-triplet np total cross section in the state ν  =  0.

In conclusion, interpretation of the experimental data on [formula] scattering on tensor polarized deuterons at missing momenta [formula]requires an accurate evaluation of FSI effects which depend strongly on the spin state of the deuteron and on the scattering kinematics.
