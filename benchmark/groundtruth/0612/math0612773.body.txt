A formula for the Euler characteristics of even dimensional triangulated manifolds

A finite simplicial complex K is called an Eulerian manifold (or a semi-Eulerian complex in the literature) if all of maximal faces have the same dimension and, for every nonempty face σ∈K,

[formula]

holds, where [formula] is the link of σ in K and Sn is the n-dimensional sphere. Note that K is not necessary connected. Any triangulation of a closed manifold is an Eulerian manifold. More generally, a triangulation of a homology manifold without boundary provides an Eulerian manifold. The purpose of this short note is to prove the following alternative formula for the Euler characteristics of even dimensional Eulerian manifolds.

Let K be a 2m-dimensional Eulerian manifold. Then

[formula]

holds, where fi(K) is the number of i-simplices of K.

A finite simplicial complex L is called a flag complex if every collection of vertices of L which are pairwise adjacent spans a simplex of L. The formula [\eqref=eq-main] was proved in [\cite=akita] under the additional assumptions that K is a PL-triangulation of a closed 2m-manifold and is a flag complex. M. W. Davis pointed out that the formula [\eqref=eq-main] follows from a result in [\cite=davis], provided K is a flag complex (see Note added in proof in [\cite=akita]). Both results follow from the considerations of the Euler characteristics of Coxeter groups. In this note, we deduce the formula [\eqref=eq-main] from the generalized Dehn-Sommerville equations proved by Klee [\cite=klee].

Let K be a finite (d - 1)-dimensional simplicial complex and fi = fi(K) the number of i-simplices of K as before. The d-tuple [formula] is called the f-vector of K. The f-polynomial fK(t) of K is defined by

[formula]

Define the h-polynomial hK(t) of K,

[formula]

by the rule hK(t) = fK(t - 1). The (d + 1)-tuple [formula] is called the h-vector of K. The h-vector of K satisfies the generalized Dehn-Sommerville equations, as stated below in Theorem [\ref=DS].

Let K be a (d - 1)-dimensional Eulerian manifold. Then

[formula]

holds for all i (0  ≤  i  ≤  d).

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=main]. We have

[formula]

Now Theorem [\ref=DS] asserts that

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Since hK( - 1) = fK( - 2) by the definition of the h-polynomial hK(t), Theorem [\ref=main] follows from [\eqref=h-poly] and [\eqref=f-poly].
