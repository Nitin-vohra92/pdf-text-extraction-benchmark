Real Analytic Sets in Complex Spaces and CR maps

Introduction

Given a real analytic set R in [formula] (we may identify [formula] with [formula]), n > 1, we consider the germ Rp of R at a point p∈R and define Xp to be the germ at p of the smallest (with respect to inclusion) complex analytic set in [formula] which contains Rp. Then Xp exists and unique for each p∈R, with [formula] being such a set for a generic R. It is natural to ask how the dimension of Xp varies with p∈R. Consider the following example (Cartan's umbrella, see [\cite=ca1])

[formula]

At a point [formula], x2  ≠  0, the complex analytic set Xp  =  {z1 = 0} contains Rp, but at the origin [formula].

The set in [\eqref=ce] is irreducible but has different dimension at different points. In particular this set is not coherent (see Section 2 for definitions). Our main result is that under the assumption that R is irreducible and has constant dimension, the dimension of Xp is constant on a dense open subset of R. More precisely, the following result holds.

Let Ω be a domain in [formula], n > 1, and R be an irreducible real analytic subset of Ω of constant positive dimension. Then

(i) There exists an integer d > 0 and a closed nowhere dense subset S of R (possibly empty) such that for any point [formula], dim Xp = d.

(ii) If R is in addition coherent, then there exists a complex analytic set X, defined in a neighbourhood of [formula] such that for any point [formula], the germ Xp is the smallest complex analytic set which contains the germ Rp.

The function d(p) =  dim Xp is upper semicontinuous on R, and therefore, dim Xp  ≥  d for p∈S. We do not know any examples where R has constant dimension and S is nonempty, and it would be interesting to obtain further information about this set. The set S is empty in the case when the germ of R is complex analytic at some point.

If R  ⊂  Ω is an irreducible real analytic set of constant dimension, which is complex analytic near some point p∈R, then R is a complex analytic subset of Ω.

Again, Cartan's example [formula] provides an irreducible real analytic set, not of constant dimension, which is complex analytic only on some part of it. Our main application concerns CR-continuation of continuous maps whose graphs are real analytic.

Let M be a real analytic CR manifold. Let [formula] be a continuous map whose graph Γf is a real analytic subset of [formula], N  ≥  1. Suppose that f is CR on a non-empty open subset of M. Then f is a CR map.

Note that the real analytic set Γf is not assumed to be non-singular, and therefore the map f need not be smooth. In this case the condition for a continuous function to be CR is understood in the sense of distributions. Further, even if Γf is smooth, the map f may still be non-smooth, for example f = x1 / 32 is a CR function on [formula], its graph is a smooth real analytic set, but f is not differentiable at {x2 = 0}.

Real analytic and subanalytic sets

In this section we briefly review basic facts about real analytic sets. A real analytic set R in an open set [formula] is locally (i.e. in a neighbourhood of each point in Ω) defined as the zero locus of finitely many real analytic functions. R is called irreducible if it cannot be represented as a union of two real analytic sets each not equal to R. The germ Rp of a real analytic set R at a point p∈R has a naturally defined complexification Rcp. If [formula] is viewed as as subset of [formula], then [formula] is the complex analytic germ at p characterized by the property that any holomorphic germ at p which vanishes on Rp necessarily vanishes on Rcp. Thus Rcp is the germ of a complex analytic set of real dimension twice that of R at p. To define complexification of real analytic sets in [formula] it is convenient to introduce the following construction.

Let [formula] be the map defined by [formula]. Then [formula] is a totally real embedding of [formula] into [formula]. Suppose R is a real analytic set of dimension d > 0, p∈R, [formula] is some neighbourhood of p, and where [formula] are real analytic in U. Then the complexification Rcp of Rp can be defined as the germ at [formula] in [formula] of the smallest complex analytic set which contains the germ of [formula] at [formula]. When U and φj are suitably chosen, the complexification may simply be given by a representative where [formula] is some neighbourhood of [formula]. Thus Rcp is the germ of a complex analytic set of complex dimension d such that [formula]. If Rp is irreducible, then so is Rcp. The following proposition allows to replace germs of analytic sets with their representatives. The proof can be found in [\cite=n].

Let R  ⊂  Ω be a real analytic set. Then for every point p∈R there is a neighbourhood U of p such that if Q is a real analytic set in Ω and Rp  ⊂  Qp, then [formula].

It follows from Proposition [\ref=p1] that the function d(p) =  dim Xp is upper semicontinuous on R. For R  ⊂  Ω real analytic denote by [formula] the sheaf of germs of real analytic functions, and by I(R) the ideal in [formula] of germs of real analytic functions that vanish on R (the so-called sheaf of ideals of R). Then R is called coherent if I(R) is a coherent sheaf of [formula]-modules. In fact, it follows from Oka's theorem (which also holds in the real analytic category) that R is coherent if the sheaf I(R) is locally finitely generated. The latter means that for every point a∈R there exists an open neighbourhood U  ⊂  Ω and a finite number of functions φj, real analytic in U and vanishing on R, such that for any point b∈U, the germs of φj at b generate the ideal I(Rb). Note that the corresponding statement for complex analytic sets always holds by Cartan's theorem, i.e. every complex analytic set is coherent.

Let [formula] be an open set, and let R  ⊂  Ω be an irreducible real analytic set of constant positive dimension d. Suppose [formula], where [formula] is a germ at point [formula] of some irreducible complex analytic set A defined in some open set in [formula]. Then for any point b∈R sufficiently close to a,

(i) [formula], where [formula] is the germ of A at [formula]. Further, [formula], and thus Rcb is the union of certain irreducible components of [formula].

(ii) If R is coherent, then [formula].

(i) Let A be an irreducible complex analytic subset of some open set [formula], [formula], such that [formula]. It follows from Proposition [\ref=p1] that if U' is sufficiently small, then [formula]. In particular, if b∈R is close to a, then [formula], and therefore, Rcb  ⊂  A. Now, since A and Rcb both have dimension d and contain [formula], which is a totally real subset of real dimension d, it follows that Rcb must coincide with the union of some irreducible components of [formula].

(ii) Since R is coherent, there exist functions [formula] real analytic in some open set [formula] containing a, such that the germs of these functions at any point b∈U generate the ideal I(Rb). Then Rcb is defined by the equations φj(z,w) = 0. By the uniqueness theorem for complex analytic sets, Rcb = Ab.

In Proposition [\ref=p2](ii) the assumption that R is coherent cannot be in general replaced by the assumption that R has constant dimension. Indeed, consider the set (cf. [\cite=ca1])

[formula]

This is an irreducible real analytic set of constant dimension which is not coherent at the origin. We may naturally identify [formula] with the set [formula]. Then the set can be viewed as the complexification of R at the origin. However, at any point p = (0,0,x3), x3  ≠  0, the germ Xp is reducible, and only one of its components is the complexification of Rp, which is irreducible. The set R in [\eqref=c2] (viewed as a subset of [formula]) is also an example of an irreducible non-coherent real analytic set which has constant dimension and such that there is no globally defined X such that Xp is the smallest complex analytic germ containing Rp for all p∈R.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=t2] we will use some results concerning subanalytic sets. A subset R of a real analytic manifold M is called semianalytic if for any point p∈M there exist a neighbourhood U and a finite number of functions φjk and ψjk real analytic in U such that In particular, a real analytic set is semianalytic. A subset S of a real analytic manifold M is called subanalytic if for any point in M there exists a neighbourhood U such that [formula] is a projection of a relatively compact semianalytic set, that is there exists a real analytic manifold N and a relatively compact semianalytic subset R of M  ×  N such that [formula], where π:M  ×  N  →  M is the projection.

The main reason for introducing the class of subanalytic sets comes from the fact that the images of semianalytic (in particular real analytic) sets under real analytic maps are subanalytic. Semi- and subanalytic sets enjoy many properties of real analytic sets, for example, a finite union, intersection and set-theoretic complement of such sets is again in the same class. Further, semi- and subanalytic sets admit stratifications satisfying certain properties.

Given a subanalytic set S, we call a point p∈S regular if near p the set S is just a real analytic manifold of dimension equal to that of S (i.e. maximal possible). Denote by reg(S) the set of all regular points. Points which are not regular form the set of singular points, sing(S). We will use the following result due to Tamm, [\cite=ta], Theorem 1.2.2(v).

If S is a subanalytic set, then reg(S) and sing(S) of S are both subanalytic. Moreover, dim sing(S)  ≤   dim S - 1, unless [formula].

For more about semianalytic and subanalytic sets see e.g. [\cite=bm] or [\cite=hi]. A detailed discussion of real analytic sets can be found in [\cite=ca1], [\cite=m] or [\cite=n].

Pre-images of projections of analytic sets

Let [formula] be a real analytic set, 0∈R, and R irreducible at the origin. Let [formula] be a representative of Rc0, the complexification of the germ R0, and let [formula] be the totally real embedding. After rescaling we may assume that A is an irreducible complex analytic subset of the unit polydisc [formula], and [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the coordinate projection onto z-subspace. For the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1] we will need the following result.

There exist a closed nowhere dense subset S of A, a neighbourhood U of [formula] in Δ2n, and a complex analytic subset Y of U with the following properties:

(a) S does not divide A, and [formula] is nowhere dense in [formula].

(b) Y can be locally given as the zero locus of a system of holomorphic equations each of which is independent of the variable w.

(c) [formula].

For 1  ≤  j  ≤  n define

[formula]

to be the coordinate projection parallel to wj-direction, and observe that for any 1  ≤  k  ≤  n,

[formula]

For p∈A let lpπ1 denote the germ of the fibre of π1|A at p, i.e. the germ at p of the set [formula]. Then by the Cartan-Remmert theorem (see e.g. [\cite=l]) the set

[formula]

is complex analytic. Suppose that dim E1  =   dim A. Then, since A is irreducible, E1 = A, and therefore every point of A has a fibre of dimension one. It follows then that π- 11(π1(A)) = A, and so π- 11(π1(A)) is a complex analytic subset of Δ2n.

Assume now that dim E1  <   dim A. Then [formula], since otherwise [formula] would be contained in a complex analytic set of dimension smaller than that of A, but A is a representative of the complexification of R0, which means that A is the smallest complex analytic set containing [formula]. Since every point in E1 has a fibre of dimension one, π- 11(π1(E1)) = E1, and if [formula], then π1(p)∉π1(E1).

Suppose that [formula]. Then [formula] is a finite set. Therefore, there exists a neighbourhood Ω0  ⊂  Δ2n of p0 such that the restriction of π1 to [formula] is a finite map. Furthermore, we can choose Ω0 to be of the form Ω0  =  Ω'0  ×  Ω''0  ⊂  Δ2n - 1  ×  Δw1, with the property that [formula]. It follows that [formula] is a proper map, and by the Remmert proper mapping theorem, [formula] is a complex analytic subset of Ω'0. Hence, [formula] is a complex analytic subset of Ω0. Furthermore,

[formula]

defines a complex analytic set that can be given by a system of equations independent of w1. We set S1 = E1, and thus we proved that there exists a neighbourhood U1 of [formula] and a complex analytic subset Y1 of U1 that locally can be represented as in [\eqref=y1]. It follows from [\eqref=proj-incl] that Y1  ⊂  π- 1(π(A)).

We now argue by induction. Suppose that there exist a closed nowhere dense subset Sk of A, which satisfies condition (a) of the lemma, and a complex analytic subset Yk of some neighbourhood Uk of [formula], which satisfies (c) and can be locally given in the form [formula], k < n. If the set Yk is reducible, we keep only one irreducible component of Yk which contains [formula], and for simplicity denote this component again by Yk. (Observe that [formula] is still irreducible, since the regular part of [formula] is connected.) Consider the set

[formula]

Then as before, Ek + 1 is a complex analytic subset of Yk. If dim Ek + 1  =   dim Yk, then Ek + 1 = Yk  =  π- 1k + 1(πk + 1(Yk)), and This show that Yk is a complex analytic subset of Uk that satisfies (c), and can be given by a system of equations independent of [formula].

Suppose now that dim Ek + 1  <   dim Yk. If [formula], then we simply define Yk + 1 = Ek + 1. This defines a complex analytic subset of Uk with all the required properties. The remaining case is [formula]. Then every point [formula] is contained in some neighbourhood in which the map πk + 1|Yk is proper, and we may repeat the argument above to define Yk + 1 to be a complex analytic subset of some neighbourhood of [formula], where [formula], such that locally Yk + 1 is given as π- 1k + 1(πk + 1(Yk)). By assumption, Sk + 1 is closed nowhere dense in A, does not divide A, and does not contain [formula]. By construction, Yk + 1 is locally given as πk + 1(Yk)  ×  Δwk + 1, and therefore it can be defined by a system independent of [formula]. Finally, by [\eqref=proj-incl], Yk + 1  ⊂  π- 1(π(A)).

After n steps the set Yn defined in a neighbourhood of [formula] will satisfy the lemma.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t1]

For each p∈R denote by d(p) the dimension of the germ Xp. Since d(p) is a positive integer-valued function on R, there exists a minimum, say d. Let q be a point where d(p) attains its minimum, and let Xq be the germ of a complex analytic set at q with dim Xq  =  d which contains Rq. Furthermore, since the set of points where R is not locally irreducible is contained in the singular part of R (and hence nowhere dense in R), the point q can be chosen in such a way that R is locally irreducible at q. This implies that Xq can also be chosen to be irreducible. Let Ω be a connected open neighbourhood of q, and X  ⊂  Ω be a particular representative of the germ Xq such that Xp is the germ of the smallest dimension containing Rp for all [formula], but X is either not defined at some point [formula] or Xp0 does not satisfy the described property. We consider two cases depending on whether Rp0 is irreducible or not.

Along with the complexification of R we may also consider the complexification in [formula] of the set X. If {φk(ζ) = 0} is the system of holomorphic equations defining X, then the system {φk(z) = 0} (variables wj are not involved) defines a complex analytic set Xz on some open set in [formula]. We note that [formula], and that the canonical complexification of X (viewed as a real analytic set) can be recovered from Xz as

[formula]

In particular, Xc  ⊂  Xz on a non-empty open set in [formula] where Xc and Xz are both well-defined.

Conversely, if Y is a complex analytic set in [formula] defined by a system of equations φk(z) = 0, which are independent of w, then Y induces a complex analytic set X in [formula] that can be defined as If fact, [formula], and [formula].

Consider first the case when Rp0 is irreducible. After a translation we may assume that p0 = 0, and so any neighbourhood of the origin contains an open piece of X. To simplify the exposition we denote by A some representative of Rc0 and assume without loss of generality that A is a complex analytic subset of the polydisc Δ2n defined by a system of equations holomorphic in Δ2n. Here [formula], and the complexification of R comes from identifying ζ with z, and [formula] with w. The set A can be chosen irreducible. Let π be as in [\eqref=proj]. By Lemma [\ref=l] there exist a closed nowhere dense subset S  ⊂  A, which does not divide A and [formula], a neighbourhood U of [formula] in Δ2n, and a complex analytic subset Y of U, which may be locally defined by a system of equations independent of w, such that [formula]. Since U is connected, and Y can be chosen irreducible, we may assume that Y has constant dimension.

Let [formula] be arbitrarily close to the origin, and [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=p2](i), there exists a neighbourhood V  ⊂  Δ2n of [formula] such that certain components of [formula] coincide with [formula]. Denote them by Ã. Since Rcp  ⊂  Xc  ⊂  Xz, we conclude that Ã  ⊂  Xz. Therefore, π- 1(π(Ã))  ⊂  Xz. Indeed, where the last equality holds because Xz is defined by a system of equation independent of w. On the other hand, X is the smallest complex analytic germ containing R, and therefore, π- 1(π(Ã)) = Xz, as otherwise, the set π- 1(π(Ã)) would induce a smaller complex analytic set in [formula] containing Rp.

We now claim that dim Y  =   dim Xz. First, observe that

[formula]

Indeed, suppose that on the contrary, dim π(Rcp) <  dim π(A). Let k be the generic dimension of the fibre [formula] for z∈π(A). Then since dim Rcp  =   dim A, The latter is a complex analytic subset of A by the Cartan-Remmert theorem, and by the assumption, it is a proper subset of A. But this contradicts irreducibility of A. Thus [\eqref=XA] holds, which implies dim π- 1(π(Rcp)) =  dim Y. But dim π- 1(π(Rcp)) =  dim Xz, as otherwise, π- 1(π(Rcp)) induces a complex analytic set in [formula] which contains Rp and which is smaller than the set induced by Xz. This proves the claim. Finally, since π- 1(π(Ã)) = Xz, the set [formula] contains [formula] as a union of locally irreducible components at p.

Thus we proved that if R is locally irreducible at p0 = 0, then for any point [formula], the set [formula] defines a complex analytic germ in [formula] at p which has dimension d and contains Rp. To complete the proof of part (i) of Theorem [\ref=t1] it remains to consider the case when Rp0 is reducible. Note that the above construction produces a complex analytic germ of dimension d which contains a dense open subset of one of the irreducible components of Rp0.

We claim that given any two points on R there exists a path γ  ⊂  R that connects these points and satisfies the property that if a∈γ is a point where R is locally reducible, then γ stays in the same local irreducible component of R at a. Arguing by contradiction, denote by Σ the set of all points on R that can be connected with a given point q by a path γ which satisfies the above property, and suppose that Σ  ≠  R. We claim that Σ is a real analytic set. Indeed, if p∈Σ is a smooth point of R, then clearly a full neighbourhood of p in R is contained in Σ. If p∈Σ is a singular point of R, then either Rp irreducible, in which case again a full neighbourhood of p in R is contained in Σ, or Rp is reducible, and only some components of Rp are in Σ. In any case, Σ is a real analytic subset of some neighbourhood of p. Since Σ is clearly closed, it follows that it is a real analytic set. Let [formula], where the closure is taken in R. Then Σ' is also a real analytic set. Indeed, if [formula], then a full neighbourhood of a in R is in Σ', and if [formula], then a∈R is a point at which Ra is reducible, and therefore near a the set Σ' coincides with some irreducible components of Ra. Since Σ' is analytic near any of its points and closed, it follows that Σ' is a real analytic set. Thus [formula], but this contradicts irreducibility of R. Hence, Σ = R, and that proves the claim.

So if in the situation above Rp0 is reducible, we find a path γ with the described property which connects q with the points on other components of Rp0 and repeat the above construction along γ sufficiently many times. This proves that there exists a dense open subset U of some neighbourhood of p0 such that for any p∈U, the germ Rp is contained in some complex variety of dimension d.

For the proof of part (ii) simply observe, that by Proposition [\ref=p2](ii), A = Xc near p, and therefore, Y defines analytic continuation of the set Xz to a neighbourhood of the origin. This in its turn provides analytic continuation of the set X to a neighbourhood of a dense open subset of R. Further, the same holds if we repeat the above construction near any other point on R, and therefore there exists a complex analytic set X in a neighbourhood of a dense open subset of R with the desired properties. Theorem [\ref=t1] is proved.

It follows from Theorem [\ref=t1] that there exists an open set [formula] such that [formula] is a complex analytic set which is dense in R. We now use the result of Diederich and Fornæ ss [\cite=df]. The claim in the proof of Theorem 4 in [\cite=df] states that if Xq is a complex analytic germ at q∈R, and Xq  ⊂  R, then there exists a neighbourhood U of q, independent of Xq, such that Xq extends to a closed complex analytic subset of U. It follows that Ω can be chosen to be a neighbourhood of R, which proves that R is a complex analytic set.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t2]

First note that Γf is an irreducible real analytic set of constant dimension. Let [formula] be the subset of M on which f is CR. Since the set of singular points of the real analytic set Γf is nowhere dense in Γf, there exists a point p∈ such that (p,f(p)) is a smooth point of Γf. Further, the point p can be chosen in such a way that Γf near (p,f(p)) is the graph of a smooth map on M. In fact, by the real analytic version of the implicit function theorem (see e.g. [\cite=ca]) there exists a neighbourhood Up of p such that the map [formula] is real-analytic.

If the CR codimension of M is zero, then M is simply a complex manifold, and the map f is holomorphic in Up. Therefore, Γf is complex analytic over Up, and by Corollary [\ref=tl] is a complex analytic set in [formula]. Since the projection π:Γf  →  M is injective, it follows (see e.g. [\cite=c]) that Γf is itself a complex manifold, π:Γf  →  M is biholomorphic, and therefore, [formula] is holomorphic everywhere on M (here [formula] is another projection). If the CR dimension of M is zero, then there is nothing to prove since any function is CR. Hence, we may assume that both the CR dimension and the CR codimension of M are positive.

The problem is local, therefore, it is enough to prove that f is CR in a neighbourhood of a point q∈M which is a boundary point of [formula], and then use a continuation argument. By [\cite=ah], there exists a neighbourhood U of q in M such that U can be generically embedded into [formula] for some n > 1, i.e. n is the sum of the CR-dimension and codimension of M. Thus, without loss of generality we may assume that M is a generic real analytic submanifold of some domain in [formula], and [formula] is a continuous map which is a real analytic CR map on some non-empty subset Ũ of M. By [\cite=t], every component fj of f|Ũ extends to a function Fj holomorphic in some neighbourhood of Ũ. Then the map [formula] defines a complex analytic set in [formula] of dimension n, namely, its graph ΓF. By construction ΓF contains the set Γf.

Observe that ΓF is the smallest complex analytic set which contains Γf. Indeed, suppose, on the contrary, that there exists a complex analytic set A, dim A  <  n, which contains a non-empty subset of Γf. Let [formula] be the projection. Then M  ⊂  π(A), where π(A) is a countable union of complex analytic sets in [formula] of dimension at most n - 1. This is however impossible, since M is a generic submanifold of [formula].

We now show that f is CR everywhere on M. By Theorem [\ref=t1], there exist a closed nowhere dense set S  ⊂  Γf, and a complex analytic subset X of a neighbourhood of [formula], dim X = n, which contains [formula]. Suppose first that p∈M, and [formula]. Choose neighbourhoods Ω and Ω' of p and p' respectively, so that [formula] is complex analytic. Let π:X  →  Ω be the projection, and let Let k be the generic dimension of [formula] for ζ∈π(X). Then k = 0, since otherwise, π(X) is a locally countable union of complex analytic sets of dimension at most n - k < n, and therefore π(X) cannot contain a generic submanifold M. Therefore, dim E  <  n, and in particular, [formula]. Consider the set [formula]. This is a real analytic subset of Ω  ×  Ω', and therefore, its projection, [formula], is a subanalytic set in Ω. From the above considerations, T  ≠  M.

We first show that for any point [formula], the map f is CR at ζ. Since π(E) is closed, there exists a neighbourhood V  ⊂  Ω of ζ such that [formula]. We may further shrink V and choose a neighbourhood V' of f(ζ) such that the projection [formula] is proper. In particular this implies that π is a branched covering. Let [formula] be the branch locus of π. Then near any point [formula] the map π- 1:V  →  X splits into a finite number of holomorphic maps. It follows that there exists a branch of π- 1, say σ, such that near a, the map f coincides with the restriction to M of a holomorphic map [formula]. Therefore f is CR. The set [formula] is the intersection of a real analytic manifold and a complex analytic subset of V, and therefore it admits a stratification into a finite number of smooth components. Each of these components is a removable CR-singularity for f. More precisely one has the following result.

Let M be a smooth generic submanifold of [formula], of positive CR dimension and codimension. Let S  ⊂  M be a smooth submanifold with dim S  <   dim M. Then any function h continuous on M and CR on [formula] is CR on M.

This is a trivial generalization of Proposition 4 in [\cite=dp] where the result is stated for real hypersurfaces. The proof is the same, with the only difference being the degree of the form φ. Applying Lemma [\ref=dpl] to each smooth component of [formula] we deduce that f is CR on [formula].

To prove that T is a removable CR-singularity for f we observe that by Proposition [\ref=t], the regular part of T, is a smooth submanifold of M, and therefore, by Lemma [\ref=dpl], reg(T) is a removable singularity for the map f. The set sing(T) is subanalytic of dimension strictly less than that of T, and we may repeat the process by induction. After finitely many steps, we conclude that f is CR near p.

To complete the proof of the theorem it remains to consider the case [formula]. We recall the construction in Lemma [\ref=l]. Let A be some representative of the complexification of the germ [formula]. In the notation of Lemma [\ref=l], let k be the smallest integer such that (i) Yk defines a complex analytic subset in a neighbourhood of [formula], where [formula], and Sj are defined as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=l], (ii) A  ⊂  Yk  ⊂  π- 1(w,w')(π(w,w')(A)), where [formula], and (iii) Yk is locally defined by a system of equations independent of (w,w'). Then for [formula], [formula] near [formula], and for any point [formula], there exists a small neighbourhood of q where Yk  =  {φν(z,z') = 0}, for some φν(z) holomorphic near q. Let

[formula]

Then there exists a neighbourhood U of [formula] such that near any point [formula], the set Γf is contained in a complex analytic set of dimension n, and [formula] is a real analytic subset of [formula]. We now may repeat the argument which we used to prove that T is a removable CR-singularity for f. Indeed, it follows that f is CR in [formula], and [formula] is a subanalytic set in M. Using Proposition [\ref=t] and Lemma [\ref=dpl] we show that f is CR on every smooth component of [formula].

This shows that Γf is the graph of a CR map at every point of [formula]. By construction, the set Sk - 1 is complex analytic, and therefore, [formula] is real analytic, and therefore the same procedure as before applies. Arguing by induction we show that for all j = 1,...,k the set [formula] is a removable CR-singularity for f. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=t2].
