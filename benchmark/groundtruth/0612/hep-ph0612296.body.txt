A4 SYMMETRY BREAKING SCHEME FOR UNDERSTANDING QUARK AND LEPTON MIXING ANGLES

Tribimaximal mixing

The current neutrino oscillation data are well described by the following MNSP mixing matrix:

[formula]

This is called "tribimaximal mixing"[\cite=tribi]. Complex phases can also be introduced. It is significant that the entries are square roots of fractions formed from small integers[\cite=zee-small-integer], and it is suggestive of a flavour symmetry. It also motivates that the flavour structure required to understand mixing should be divorced from whatever physics is needed to understand the mass eigenvalues, because the latter do not at this stage seem to show suggestive patterns.

We shall call a matrix "form diagonalisable (FD)" if its (left) diagonalisation matrix is formed from definite numbers while its eigenvalues are free parameters.[\cite=fd] A simple 2  ×  2 example is

[formula]

whose diagonalisation matrix gives two-fold maximal mixing, while its eigenvalues are arbitrary and depend on m1,2. This matrix has a Z2 structure, and arose in the mirror matter model.[\cite=mm] A relevant 3  ×  3 example is

[formula]

where [formula] is a cube root of unity. It is equal to

[formula]

where the left-diagonalisation matrix is "trimaximal":

[formula]

Since the MNSP matrix [formula] is the product of two diagonalisation matrices, we observe that tribimaximal mixing is obtained from [formula] when

[formula]

which is the previous Z2 structure in the (1,3) subspace.

A4 scheme and tree-level results

A4 is the set of even permutations of four objects.[\cite=a4] [\cite=af] It has 12 elements: 1,c,a = c- 1,r1,2,3 = r- 11,2,3,ricri,riari, where {1,c,a} form C3  =  Z3 subgroup, {1,ri} form Z2 subgroups (see[\cite=zee-small-integer] for notation). Its irreducible reps are [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] with [formula]. Under the group element corresponding to c(a),   →  ω(ω2) and   →  ω2(ω).

Let (x1,x2,x3) and (y1,y2,y3) denote the basis vectors for two [formula]'s. Then

[formula]

Under [formula], choose:[\cite=xg]

[formula]

for the fermions, and for the Higgs multiplets:

[formula]

The required spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern is given by the VEVs:

[formula]

The quark mass matrices come from 〈Φ〉 and have the form U(ω) multiplied by a diagonal matrix of arbitrary eigenvalues, so at tree level UCKM  =  1. The charged lepton mass matrices also come from 〈Φ〉, so the left diagonalisation matrix is U(ω). The neutrino Dirac masses arise from 〈φ〉: mDνdiag(1,1,1). The neutrino RH Majorana masses are driven by 〈χ〉 plus bare masses. The overall ν mass matrix is

[formula]

and the effective light ν mass matrix is

[formula]

Note the Z2 structure in (1,3) subspace.

So, at tree-level we have tribimaimxal mixing (up to phases):

[formula]

In the neutrino sector, the mixing pattern is driven by 〈χ〉:A4  →  Z2. For the rest of the fermions, the patterns are driven by 〈Φ〉:A4  →  Z3. This dual symmetry breaking structure gives trivial CKM and tribimaximal MNSP. For theory as a whole, of course, A4  →   nothing. We can describe this situation as "parallel worlds of A4 symmetry breaking."[\cite=xg]

Corrections after flavour symmetry breaking

The above mixing matrix results hold only at lowest order. After spontaneous A4 symmetry breaking, deviations are induced. Because of the parallel worlds of symmetry breaking, it is useful to classify these effects into those within each sector (the neutrino sector and the charged-fermion sector), and those acting between sectors.[\cite=xg]

Within each sector, we can write down the mass entries permitted by the unbroken symmetry in that sector, not all of which are generated at tree-level. For quarks and charged leptons, the tree-level form is not changed, so the left diagonalisation matrices are still U(ω). This means the CKM matrix is still trivial. This is ensured by the unbroken Z3 in the quark sector.

But, the effective light ν matrix changes:

[formula]

where h.o. denotes higher order. This means that VνL becomes

[formula]

where [formula] and |δ|  ≪  1 if the h.o. corrections are small. Hence,

[formula]

There are deviations from tribimaximal mixing in the first and third columns, including a nonzero Ue3.

We now turn to interactions between the sectors. To generate realistic CKM mixing, we need to break the Z3. But in the theory overall, it is broken. Hence one way that CKM mixing might be generated is through the mediation of Z3 breaking in the neutrino sector to the quark sector, for example through effective operators like

[formula]

There is enough freedom at this level to generate a realistic CKM matrix. But it is not yet clear if that is the best way to do it, though it seems like a natural feature to have.

Challenges and conclusions

The theory needs to be "completed", as the above is a symmetry scheme without a fully sepcified dynamics. The default possibility is a standard Higgs potential. But this raises a non-trivial problem: How to keep the parallel worlds of symmetry breaking controllably intact? Unfortunately, the Higgs potential interactions between Φ and χ tend to spoil the different VEV patterns required. So, at least some of these interactions need to eliminated. What are the logical possibilities?[\cite=xg]

Normal internal symmetries do not work, because a term like [formula] is always invariant.

One possibility is to decouple χ or νR,χ from rest of theory by making certain parameters very small (hidden sector). It is not known if this can be made to work

A second possibility is supersymmetry, because terms like [formula] come from superpotential terms Φu  Φd  χ and the latter can be forbidden by an internal symmetry. We have constructed an inelegant existence proof for this.

A third possibility is to sequester χ on different brane from Φ.[\cite=af]

There may be others.

Overall, we conclude that A4 has the potential to simultaneously explain the quark and lepton mixing matrices, while leaving the masses arbitrary. This works at a symmetry level - which is my main point - but a dynamically complete theory is a work-in-progress.
