Introduction

A partial linear space is a point-line geometry S = (P,L) with 'point-set' P and 'line-set' L of subsets of P of size at least 2 such that any two distinct points are contained in at most one line. Two distinct points x and y are collinear, written as x  ~  y, if there is a line containing them. In that case we denote this line by xy. We write [formula] if two distinct points x and y are not collinear. For x∈P and A  ⊆  P, we define [formula] and [formula]. Note that [formula] if x  ~  y. A subset of P is a subspace of S if any line containing at least two of its points is contained in it. A geometric hyperplane of S is a subspace, different from the empty set and P, that meets every line non-trivially. The graph Γ(P) with vertex set P, in which two distinct vertices are adjacent if they are collinear in S, is the collinearity graph of S. The diameter of Γ(P) is called the diameter of S. If Γ(P) is connected, we say that S is connected.

A near polygon [\cite=SY] is a connected partial linear space of finite diameter satisfying the following near-polygon property (NP): For each point-line pair (x,l) with x∉l, there is a unique point in l nearest to x. If the diameter of S is n, then S is called a near 2n-gon, and for n = 3 a near hexagon. A near 0-gon is a point and a near 2-gon is a line. An important class of near polygons is the the class of generalized 2n-gons. Near 4-gons are precisely the class of generalized quadrangles.

Let S = (P,L) be a near polygon. A subset C of P is convex if every shortest path in Γ(P) between two points of C is entirely contained in C. A quad is a convex subset of P of diameter 2 such that no point of it is adjacent to all other points of it. We denote by d(x,y) the distance in Γ(P) between two points x and y of S. Let x1 and x2 be two points of S with d(x1,x2) = 2. If x1 and x2 have at least two common neighbours y1 and y2 such that one of the lines xiyj contains at least three points, then x1 and x2 are contained in a unique quad which is a generalized quadrangle ([\cite=SY], Proposition 2.5, p.10). A near polygon is called dense if every pair of points at distance 2 have at least two common neighbours. A structure theory for dense near polygons can be found in [\cite=BW]. Dual polar spaces were characterized in terms of point-line geometries by Cameron. We refer to [\cite=Ca] for the definition and the related results concerning dual polar space. The class of dual polar spaces coincides with the class of classical dense near polygons.

In a dense near polygon, the number of lines through a point is independent of that point ([\cite=BW], Lemma 19, p.152). A dense near 2n-gon is said to have parameters (s,t) if each line contains s + 1 points and each point is contained in t + 1 lines. For n = 2, a generalized quadrangle with parameters (s,t) is written as (s,t)-GQ, for short. A near polygon is slim if each line contains exactly three points. In that case if x and y are two collinear points, we define x * y by xy = {x,y,x * y}. All slim dense near hexagons have been classified by Brouwer et al. [\cite=BCHW]. We refer to [\cite=Bart-book] and [\cite=V] for some new classification results concerning slim dense near polygons.

([\cite=BCHW], Theorem 1.1, p.349) Any slim dense near hexagon is finite and is isomorphic to one of the eleven near hexagons with parameters as given below:

[formula]

Here v is the number of points, t is the number of lines containing a point and t2 is defined by [formula] for points x,y with d(x,y) = 2 (though this depends on x and y).

The slim dense near hexagon on 135 points with parameters (s,t,t2) = (2,6,2) is the symplectic dual polar space of rank 3 over the field F2 with two elements. We denote this near hexagon by DSp(6,2) and by [formula] the near hexagon on 105 points with parameters (s,t,t2) = (2,5,{1,2}). In the following, we present three known descriptions of the near hexagon [formula]. An equivalent description of this near hexagon is given in ([\cite=BCHW], p.352) using the notion of a Fischer space.

([\cite=BCHW], p.355) Let X be a set of size 8. Let S be the partial linear space whose point set consists of all partitions of X into four 2-subsets, and lines are the collections of partitions sharing two 2-subsets. Then S is a slim dense near hexagon isomorphic to [formula].

([\cite=BCHW], p.352) Let Q(6,2) be a non-singular quadric in PG(6,2) and let DQ(6,2) be the associated dual polar space. Let Π be a hyperplane of PG(6,2) intersecting Q(6,2) in a non-singular hyperbolic quadric Q+(5,2). The set of all maximal subspaces of Q(6,2) which are not contained in Q+(5,2) is a subspace of DQ(6,2) isomorphic to the near hexagon [formula]. (Note that DQ(6,2) is isomorphic to DSp(6,2).)

The next construction (Example [\ref=bart-de-bruyn]) is due to Bart De Bruyn ([\cite=D], p.51). We first note down some facts about (2,2)-GQs which play an important role in Example [\ref=bart-de-bruyn] below as well as in our constructions in the next section.

Let S = (P,L) be a (2,2)-GQ. Then S is unique up to an isomorphism ([\cite=PT], 5.2.3, p.78). In the notation of [\cite=PT], S is isomorphic to the classical generalized quadrangle W(2)≃Q(4,2). A combinatorial model of a (2,2)-GQ: Let Ω  =  {1,2,3,4,5,6}. An edge of Ω is a 2-subset of Ω. A factor of Ω is a set of three pair-wise disjoint edges. Let E be the set of all edges and F be the set of all factors of Ω. Then |E| = |F| = 15. Taking E as the point-set and F as the line-set, the pair (E,F) is a (2,2)-GQ.

A k-arc of points of S is a set of k pair-wise non-collinear points of S. A k-arc is complete if it is not contained in a (k + 1)-arc. A point x is a center of a k-arc if x is collinear with every point of it. A 3-arc is called a triad. We refer to [\cite=S] for a detailed study of k-arcs of a (2,t)-GQ. We repeatedly use the following result, mostly without mention.

([\cite=S], Proposition 3.2, p.161) Let S = (P,L) be a (2,2)-GQ and T be a triad of points of S. Then

[formula] or 3;

[formula] if and only if T is an incomplete triad if and only if T is contained in a unique (2,1)-subGQ of S;

[formula] if and only if T is a complete triad.

Dually, we can define a k-arc of lines of S and center of such a k-arc. Since W(2) is self-dual ([\cite=PT], 3.2.1, p.43), Lemma [\ref=facts-triads] holds for a triad of lines also. From the combinatorial model above, it can be seen that any two non-collinear points (respectively; disjoint lines) of S are contained in a unique complete triad of points (respectively; lines) of S.

([\cite=D], p.51) Let S = (P,L) be the (2,2)-GQ. A partial linear space S' = (P',L') can be constructed from S as follows. Set

[formula]

There are four types of lines in L'. For each line l = {x,y,z} of S, we have the following lines of S' (up to a permutation of the points of l):

{(x,x),(y,y),(z,z)},

{(x,x),(x,y),(x,z)},

{(x,y),(y,z),(z,x)}.

Let T = {k,m,n} be an incomplete triad of lines of S such that [formula]. We may assume that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Let x' be an arbitrary point of [formula]. Let y' (respectively, z') be the unique point of [formula] (respectively, [formula]) not collinear with x'. Then the lines of fourth type are:

{(x,x'),(y,y'),(z,z')}.

Then S' is a slim dense near hexagon isomorphic to [formula]. (It can be seen that the set {x',y',z'} is an incomplete triad of points of S.)

New Constructions

Here, we provide new geometrical constructions for the near hexagons DSp(6,2) and [formula] from two copies of a (2,2)-GQ. In fact, we first construct [formula] and then construct DSp(6,2) in which [formula] is embedded as a geometric hyperplane.

Construction of [formula]

In this construction the point set is the same as in Example [\ref=bart-de-bruyn] (up to an isomorphism). Let S = (P,L) and S' = (P',L') be two (2,2)-GQs. Let x  ↔  x', x∈P,x'∈P', be an isomorphism between S and S'. We define a partial linear space S = (P,L) as follows. The point set is

[formula]

and the lines are of the form

[formula]

where T = {x,y,z} is either a line or a complete triad and [formula].

The partial linear space S = (P,L) is a slim dense near hexagon with parameters (s,t,t2) = (2,5,{1,2}).

Construction of DSp(6,2)

Let S = (P,L), S' = (P',L') and S = (P,L) be as in the construction of [formula]. We define a partial linear space [formula] as follows. The point set is

[formula]

and the line set [formula] consists of the lines in L together with the following collection [formula] of lines:

The collection [formula] consists of lines of the form {x,(x,u'),u'} for every point (x,u')∈P.

The partial linear space [formula] is a slim dense near hexagon with parameters (s,t,t2) = (2,6,2)

An immediate consequence of Theorems [\ref=first-main-theorem] and [\ref=second-main-theorem] is that the near hexagon [formula] is a geometric hyperplane of the near hexagon DSp(6,2).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=first-main-theorem]

Let α  =  (x,u') and β  =  (y,v') be two distinct points of S. By the construction of lines of S, α  ~  β if and only if x  ≠  y, u'  ≠  v', [formula] and [formula]. Let α and β be distinct non-collinear points of S. Then one of the following possibilities occur:

x = y,u'  ≠  v';

x  ≠  y,u' = v';

x  ≠  y,u'  ≠  v', [formula] and [formula];

x  ≠  y,u'  ≠  v' and either [formula] and [formula] or [formula] and [formula].

Assume that (A1) or (A2) holds. Then [formula].

Assume that (A1) holds. Then [formula]. If u'  ~  v', we may assume that v'  ≠  x'. So x'v' = u'v'. Then (v,u' * v') and (x * v,u' * v') are in [formula]. If [formula], let {u',v',w'} be the complete triad of S' containing u' and v'. Then (a,w') and (b,w') are in [formula], where [formula].

Now assume that (A2) holds. Then [formula] in S. If x  ~  y, we assume that u  ≠  y. Then (x * y,y') and (x * y,y' * u') are in [formula]. If [formula], let {x,y,w} be the complete triad of S containing x and y. Let [formula] in S. Then (w,a') and (w,b') are in [formula].

Assume that (A3) holds. Then [formula].

If x  ~  y and u'  ~  v', then {x',y',u',v'} form a quadrangle in S'. Then (u,x'), (v,y') and (u * v,x' * y') are in [formula].

If x  ~  y and [formula], let T' = {u' * x',v' * y',z'} be the complete triad of S' containing u' * x' and v' * y'. Then [formula] and x' * y'∉T'. Now, x' * y'  ~  z', because [formula], [formula] and T' is a complete triad. Then (u * x,x'),(v * y,y') and (z,x' * y') are in [formula].

By a similar argument, if [formula] and u'  ~  v' then (u,u' * x'),(v,v' * y') and (u * v,z') are in [formula], where {u' * x',v' * y',z'} is the complete triad of S' containing u' * x' and v' * y'.

Now, assume that [formula] and [formula]. If u' = x' and v' = y', then (a,a'),(b,b') and (c,c') are in [formula], where [formula] in S'. We may assume that v'  ≠  y'. Then the complete triads [formula] and [formula] of S' intersect at w' = v' * y'. This fact is independent of whether u' = x' or not. Let [formula] and [formula] in S'. Since [formula], [formula] and {p',q',w'} is a complete triad of S', each of a' and b' is collinear with exactly one of p' and q'. Similarly, each of p' and q' is collinear with exactly one of a' and b'. So, we may assume that a'  ~  p' and b'  ~  q'. Then (p,a'),(q,b') and (w,w') are contained in [formula].

Assume that (A4) holds. Then d(α,β) = 3.

We may assume that [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that d(α,β) = 2 and [formula]. Then z∉{x,y}, w'∉{u',v'}, [formula] and [formula]. Let T' = {x',y',z'}. Then T' is either a line or a complete triad of S', because x,y and z are pair-wise distinct and [formula] with u'  ≠  w'. Since [formula], it follows that [formula] and [formula], a contradiction to our assumption.

So d(α,β)  ≠  2. Now, choose [formula] with w'  ≠  u'. Then α  ~  (y,w') and d((y,w'),β) = 2 by Lemma [\ref=one-argument-coincide]. Hence d(α,β) = 3.

As a consequence of the above results, we have

The diameter of S is 3.

We next prove that the near-polygon property (NP) is satisfied in S. Let [formula] be a line and θ be a point of S. Let α = (x,u'),β = (y,v'),γ = (z,w') and θ  =  (p,q'). Then T = {x,y,z} is either a line or a complete triad of S and [formula].

If θ has distance 2 from two points of [formula], then it is collinear with the third point of [formula].

Let d(θ,α) = d(θ,β) = 2. We prove θ  ~  γ by showing that p  ≠  z,q'  ≠  w', [formula] and [formula].

If p = x and q'  ≠  v' (respectively, p  ≠  x and q' = v'), then d(θ,β) = 2 (respectively, d(θ,α) = 2) yields [formula] (respectively, [formula]), a contradiction. So p = x if and only if q' = v'. Similarly, p = y if and only if q' = u'. Thus, if p∈{x,y}, then p  ≠  z,q'  ≠  w', [formula] and [formula].

If p∉{x,y}, then the above argument implies that p  ≠  z and q'  ≠  w'. Also, d(θ,α) = d(θ,β) = 2 yields [formula] and [formula]. This implies that [formula] and [formula].

If θ has distance 3 from two points of [formula], then it has distance 2 to the third point of [formula].

Let d(θ,α) = d(θ,β) = 3. We prove d(θ,γ) = 2. By Lemma [\ref=one-argument-coincide], we may assume that p  ≠  z and q'  ≠  w'. This together with d(θ,α) = d(θ,β) = 3 imply that p'∉T', [formula]. We show that [formula] and [formula]. This would complete the proof.

Suppose that [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then, d(θ,α) = d(θ,β) = 3 yields [formula]. This implies that [formula], a contradiction. A similar argument shows that if [formula], then [formula], a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=first-main-theorem]. Propositions [\ref=distance-2-to-two-points] and [\ref=distance-3-to-two-points] together with Corollary [\ref=diameter-3] imply that S is a near hexagon. By Lemmas [\ref=one-argument-coincide] and [\ref=no-argument-coincide-distance-2], S is dense. Since |P| = 105, Theorem [\ref=classification-result] completes the proof.

Thus, quads in S are (2,1) or (2,2)-GQs. In fact, it can be shown that equality holds in Lemmas [\ref=one-argument-coincide] and [\ref=no-argument-coincide-distance-2].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=second-main-theorem]

By the construction of lines of [formula], no two points of P, as well as of P', are collinear in [formula]. Further, if x∈P and u'∈P', then x  ~  u' if and only if (x,u')∈P, or equivalently, [formula] in S'. Let α and β be two distinct non-collinear points of [formula] with [formula]. Then one of the following possibilities occur:

α = x and β = y for some x,y∈P with x  ≠  y;

α = u' and β = v' for some u',v'∈P' with u'  ≠  v';

α = x∈P and β = u'∈P' with [formula];

α = x∈P and β = (y,v')∈P with x  ≠  y and [formula] in S';

α = u'∈P' and β = (y,v')∈P with u'  ≠  v' and [formula] in S;

α = x∈P and β = (y,v')∈P with x  ≠  y and [formula] in S';

α = u'∈P' and β = (y,v')∈P with u'  ≠  v' and [formula] in S.

Assume that (B1) or (B2) holds. Then [formula] in [formula].

If (B1) holds, then [formula] in [formula] for each [formula] in S'. So [formula]. Similarly, if (B2) holds then [formula].

Assume that (B3) holds. Then d(α,β) = 3.

Clearly d(α,β)  ≥  3 since [formula]. Let [formula] in S'. Then x,v',v,u' is a path of length 3 in [formula]. So d(α,β) = 3.

Assume that (B4) or (B5) holds. Then [formula].

Assume that (B4) holds. If x  ~  y in S, then v'∈x'y' in S'. We may assume that v'  ≠  x'. Then v',(x,x') and (x,v' * x') are in [formula]. If [formula] in S, let [formula] in S'. Then v',(x,u') and (x,w') are in [formula]. A similar argument holds if (B5) holds.

Assume that (B6) or (B7) holds. Then d(α,β) = 3.

Assume that (B6) holds. Suppose that [formula]. Then θ  ≠  v', since [formula] in S'. So θ = (x,w') for some [formula]. Then θ  ~  β implies that [formula] in S', a contradiction. So d(α,β)  ≠  2. Now, y  ~  β and d(α,y) = 2 (Lemma [\ref=distanct-x] [\ref=y-in-P-u'] [\ref=v'-in-P']). So d(α,β) = 3. A similar argument can be applied if (B7) holds.

As a consequence of the above results of this section together with Corollary [\ref=diameter-3], we have

The diameter of [formula] is 3.

Next we prove that the property (NP) is satisfied in [formula].

Let [formula] be a line of [formula] of type [formula] and α be a point of [formula] not contained in [formula]. Then α is nearest to exactly one point of [formula].

Let [formula] where β = (x,u')∈P. Let α = v'∈P'. Then v'  ≠  u' and d(α,u') = 2 (Lemma [\ref=distanct-x] [\ref=y-in-P-u'] [\ref=v'-in-P']). Now d(α,β) = 2 or 3 according as [formula] in S or not. In the first case, α  ~  x, and in the later case, d(α,x) = 3 (Lemma [\ref=distance-2-x] [\ref=(y] [\ref=v')]). A similar argument holds if α∈P.

Let α = (y,v')∈P. If x = y, then u'  ≠  v' and [formula] in S. So α  ~  x and d(α,β) = d(α,u') = 2 (Lemmas [\ref=one-argument-coincide] and [\ref=distance-2-x] [\ref=(y] [\ref=v')]). Similarly, if u' = v' then α  ~  u' and d(α,β) = d(α,x) = 2 . Assume that x  ≠  y and u'  ≠  v'. If α  ~  β, then [formula] and [formula] in S'. So d(α,x) = d(α,u') = 2 (Lemma [\ref=distance-2-x] [\ref=(y] [\ref=v')]). If d(α,β) = 2, then [formula] and [formula] in S'. By Lemma [\ref=distance-3-x] [\ref=(y] [\ref=v')], d(α,x) = d(α,u') = 3. If d(α,β) = 3, then either [formula] and [formula], or [formula] and [formula] in S'. Then d(α,x) = 3 and d(α,u') = 2 in the first case, and d(α,x) = 2 and d(α,u') = 3 in the later.

Now, let [formula] be a line of [formula] and [formula]. We take β = (x,u'),θ = (y,v') and γ = (z,w').

If α has distance 2 from two points of [formula], then it is collinear with the third point of [formula].

Let α = q'∈P' and d(α,β) = d(α,θ) = 2. Then q'∉{u',v'} and [formula] in S. Thus, [formula] in S'. So q' = w' and α  ~  γ. A similar argument holds if α∈P.

If α has distance 3 from two points of [formula], then it has distance 2 to the third point of [formula].

Let α = q'∈P' and d(α,β) = d(α,θ) = 3. Then q'∉{u',v'} and [formula] in S. So q'  ≠  w' and [formula] in S'. The later follows because {x,y,z} is a line or a complete triad of S. Thus, d(α,γ) = 2. A similar argument holds if α∈P.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=second-main-theorem]. By the results of this section together with Theorem [\ref=first-main-theorem], [formula] is a slim dense near hexagon. Since |P| = 135, Theorem [\ref=classification-result] completes the proof.
