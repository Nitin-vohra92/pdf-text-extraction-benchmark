Epicyclic Frequencies and Resonant Phenomena Near Black Holes: The Current Status

In the framework of general relativity the successive theory of epicyclic motion around rotating black holes was first developed in Refs.[\cite=ag1] [\cite=ag2](see also a review paper [\cite=agr]). As is known, the rotating black holes are uniquely described by the famous Kerr solution

[formula]

where the metric functions

[formula]

The equation of motion for a test particle of mass μ and charge e has the form

[formula]

From the symmetry properties of the metric ([\ref=kmetric]) it follows that a cyclic motion of the test particle is possible in the equatorial plane   θ  =  π / 2  . For the cyclic motion we have zμ(s) = u0s    {1,0,0,ω0}, where ω0 is the angular velocity of the motion.

To describe the epicyclic motion of the test particle we employ a perturbative expansion about the cyclic orbits, i.e. we assume that xμ(s) = zμ(s) + ξμ(s). Substituting this into equation ([\ref=eqmot]) and adding also the external force fμ = fμ~  ~ νuν(u0)- 1, we arrive at the equation

[formula]

where Nμ stands for the non-linear terms, the quantities γμα and ∂aUμ must be taken on a cyclic orbit r = r0,    θ   =   π  /  2 and

[formula]

Performing an appropriate integration in ([\ref=perteq]) and restricting ourselves to the first order terms in ξ we obtain the set of equations

[formula]

We see that in the absence of the external force the epicyclic motion is governed by the two decoupled oscillatory-type equations. In other words, it amounts to free radial and vertical oscillations with the associated frequencies

[formula]

The explicit expressions for these frequencies were first found in Ref. [\cite=ag1] in the most general case of black holes with an electric charge or with an external uniform magnetic field. Further, the epicyclic frequencies were used to explore the maser effect near black holes [\cite=ag2] as well as the effects of periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring drag in the Schwarzschild and Kerr fields threaded by a cosmic string [\cite=ag3]. For a "pure" Kerr field the frequencies are [\cite=ag1] [\cite=ag2]

[formula]

where ω0  =    ±    ωK / (1  ±  aωK), [formula] is the Kepler frequency and the two signs refer to direct and retrograte motions. Later, in 1987 our expression for the frequency of radial oscillations was re-derived in Ref.[\cite=kato1], while the formula for the frequency of vertical oscillations re-appeared [\cite=kato2] only in 1990.

In Ref. [\cite=ag1] we have also pointed out that when taking into account the non-linear terms on the right-hand-side of Eq. ([\ref=perteq]) a coupling between the oscillations occurs. If the frequencies ωr and ωθ are in the rational relation kr  ωr    =  kθ  ωθ, where kr and kθ are integers, the resonances must take place. We have plotted the positions of low-order (k = |kr|  +  |kθ|) resonances: k = 3,  4,  5, ~  ~  ~  ~ or ~  ~  ~ (2:1,  3:1,  3:2). In recent developments, this theory has been extensively used to explain the frequency ratios and the origin of high frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in many cases of accreting black hole or neutron star binaries (see papers [\cite=mvs] [\cite=taks] and references therein). In some cases, even our plots for the positions of the non-linear resonances were exactly reproduced (see for instance, Ref.[\cite=marek]).

Our model also admits the appearance of the forced resonances under a perturbing force. Solving Eqs.(5)-(7) for Fourier transforms we obtain

[formula]

We see that at the frequencies ω  =  mω0  , ~  ~ ω  =  Ω±r  =  mω0  ±  ωr    , ~  ~ ω  =  Ω±θ  =  mω0  ±  ωθ     the system exhibits the resonant behaviour [\cite=ag2]. The similar type of the resonant frequencies was discussed by Kato [\cite=kato3] within a model for kHz QPOs resonantly induced in warped disks of X-ray binaries. In the latest developments, we have performed a complete numerical analysis of the frequency ratios pertaining to the orbits where the frequency of the radial oscillations approaches its maximum value. Some results for direct orbits and for masses [formula] are given in the Table.
