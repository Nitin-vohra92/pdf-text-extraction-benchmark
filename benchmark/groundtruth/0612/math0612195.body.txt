An arithmetic model for the total disorder process

Introduction

A classical result of Selberg [\cite=Selb89] (see also Laurin cikas, [\cite=Laurin]) states that the classical continuous determination of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta function is asymptotically normally distributed, in the sense that if Γ is a regular Borel measurable subset of [formula], where 1  1 is the indicator function, and regular means that the boundary of Γ has zero Lebesgue measure.

If we let then Selberg's result implies that where [formula] is a complex-valued Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance λ / 2, i.e.: G(1)λ and G(2)λ are independent, centered, and [formula].

It is now a natural question, at least from a probabilistic standpoint, to look for an asymptotic distribution for [formula], for different λi's.

For [formula], and for every [formula] regular,

[formula]

We now note that if [formula] is a totally disordered complex-valued Gaussian process, meaning that [formula] and [formula] are two independent Gaussian processes all of whose coordinates are independent with [formula], then the quantity on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:main] is

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is an attempt to move from the deterministic set up of the Riemann zeta function, and the "static" central limit theorem of Selberg into a more "dynamic" probabilistic world, where a process appears in the limit. However, this process is quite wild. In the next section, we comment about it, and some of its occurrences in random matrix theory. Finally, in the third section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main] using the method of moments.

Our methods apply equally well to any L-function from the Selberg class, but for concreteness and for the sake of simplicity we only state here the result for the Riemann zeta function.

Some remarks on total disorder process

Non-measurability of the total disorder process

The total disorder process is a "wild" process; indeed there is no measurable process (λ,ω)  ↦  D̃λ(ω) which would be a modification of (Dλ,λ  ≥  0), i.e. [formula] for all λ. Indeed, if so, we would get (use Fubini)

[formula]

hence

[formula]

which is absurd (for some further discussion on the total disorder process, see page 37 of [\cite=RevYor]).

The total disorder process in random matrix theory

The total disorder process has already been observed asymptotically in random matrix theory, although in a different guise. Let [formula] be the characteristic polynomial of an N  ×  N unitary matrix U chosen with Haar measure, then Hughes, Keating and O'Connell [\cite=HKO2] prove that weakly converges to [formula], where X(θ),Y(θ) are independent Gaussian processes with covariance structure

This was used to provide an explanation for the covariance structure of CU(s,t), the number of eigenangles of U that lie in the interval (s,t), found earlier by Wieand [\cite=Wieand] [\cite=Wieand1]. A separate explanation was given by Diaconis and Evans [\cite=DE]. Let Wieand proves that for fixed s,t, if the matrices U are chosen with Haar measure from the unitary group, then [formula] converges in distribution, as N  →    ∞  , to a standard normal random variable. In fact she goes much further by proving weak convergence of [formula] to a certain Gaussian process C(s,t).

For -  π < s < t  ≤  π, the finite dimensional distributions of the process [formula] converge as N  →    ∞   to those of a centered Gaussian process C(s,t) with covariance structure

A similar process result had previously been found by Costin and Lebowitz [\cite=CL] for GUE matrices, and Soshnikov [\cite=Sosh] considers a process result for counting the number of eigenangles in an interval with a given minimum displacement. The surprising thing about these correlations is that they imply that even if an interval I contains more than the average number of eigenangles, then any subset of I not sharing a common endpoint with I will usually still contain its average number. Also, no matter how close two intervals I and J are, unless they share an endpoint, then CI and CJ (with obvious notations) are independent.

Of course, the results of Wieand and of Hughes, Keating and O'Connell are strongly related, because

Proof of theorem [\ref=thm:main]

We will prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main] via the method of moments. The following lemma will play an essential role in our argument.

A complex random variable [formula] has moments

[formula]

if and only if X and Y are independent and distributed according to the normal law with mean zero and variance σ2.

Let [formula] where X and Y are independent, centered normal random variables with variance σ2. Consider the joint moment generating function of Z and [formula]: for [formula],

[formula]

which is the two-variable moment generating function of [\eqref=eq:little_lemma]. Conversely, assume that [\eqref=eq:little_lemma] holds for the joint moments of Z and [formula]. Then working up the above chain of equalities proves that [formula] where X and Y are independent, centered gaussians with variance σ2.

From Lemma [\ref=lem:little_lemma], if one can show that for any positive integers k and any integers [formula], and if for any [formula] then one may conclude that [formula] is a centered complex-valued Gaussian totally disordered process with covariance structure and [formula] for all λi,λj.

Therefore, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is a consequence of the following

Let If [formula] are fixed, then where δ(mj,nj)  =  1 if mj = nj and zero otherwise.

We need the following theorem of Selberg, [\cite=Selb89].

If n is a positive integer, 0 < a < 1, and Ta / n  ≤  x  ≤  T1 / n, then for some constant A which depends upon a.

We also need to calculate the moments of certain prime sums.

Given k a positive integer, let [formula]. Let For any non-negative integers [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

(Note that for the sake of simplicity the variable u does not appear explicitly in ([\ref=eq:mmts_primes_show_this]) and in some expressions below)

We wish to expand out as a multiple sum over primes. It is exceedingly complicated. We will introduce the following notation: For [formula], let and let Hence

[formula]

Similarly, we let and let and so

[formula]

Finally, let [formula] and [formula], and let Therefore,

[formula]

We divide the sum up into two parts, depending on whether [formula] equals zero or not. The terms where the sum vanishes we call diagonal terms; the other terms are off-diagonal. The proof of the lemma will follow from showing that the off-diagonal terms do not contribute in the large-N limit, and using a simple combinatorial enumeration of the diagonal terms, along with the prime number theorem, to estimate the diagonal terms.

The diagonal terms

We will see below in §[\ref=sect:off-diag] that since [formula], then for sufficiently large N, the only way for [formula] is if for each [formula] separately. Thus the diagonal terms are those contained in the sets

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] are both prime, the set Dj is empty unless mj  =  nj. Under such an assumption, the diagonal terms in [\eqref=eq:prod_expanded] are If [formula] are distinct primes, then there are (nj)! ways of choosing [formula] such that the products are equal. (If the [formula] are not distinct, then the result is similar, but with a different combinatorial factor, and the result is at least a couple of logarithms smaller). Hence

[formula]

Hence the diagonal contribution to [\eqref=eq:prod_expanded] is which is the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:mmts_primes_show_this] in the large-N limit. (The constant implicit in the O-term depends on mj,nj,λj and k, but these are all constants). Hence the proof of the lemma will be complete if we can show there is no contribution to [\eqref=eq:mmts_primes_show_this] from the off-diagonal terms, the terms where [formula].

The off-diagonal terms

Now we show that the non-diagonal terms of [\eqref=eq:prod_expanded] do not contribute to [\eqref=eq:mmts_primes_show_this] in the limit. Upon integrating [\eqref=eq:prod_expanded] for u between 1 and 2, we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] denotes that we are summing only over the non-diagonal terms, those terms where [formula].

Recall that, without loss of generality, we assumed [formula]. Assume

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], we have which follows from the fact that if m,n are positive integers, and m  ≠  n, then | log (m / n)|  >  1 / (2 min (m,n)). Furthermore, for j > 1, for [formula] and [formula], then for sufficiently large N, and so we can conclude that if [\eqref=eq:cond_on_non_diag] holds,

[formula]

for sufficiently large N, since λj  <  λ1 for all j > 1.

The contribution of such terms to [\eqref=eq:off_diag_terms] is clearly bounded by

[formula]

once more using the fact that for sufficiently large N.

Therefore, as N tends to infinity, we see that terms which satisfy [\eqref=eq:cond_on_non_diag] vanish. Thus, for a non-zero result in the limit, we must have That is, we must have [formula], where D1 is defined in [\eqref=eq:defn_D].

The terms which might possibly contribute to [\eqref=eq:off_diag_terms] are The same argument as above, shows that the terms with contribute

[formula]

If [formula], then [\eqref=eq:diag_terms] shows that which is negligible compared to [formula]. Hence, finally, these terms do not contribute.

Repeating the argument for λj, [formula] we see that any term with has a vanishing contribution to the large-N limit. Therefore, the main term must come from those terms for which for all j. Such terms are the diagonal terms, and their contribution has been calculated above. This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:mmts_primes].

Recall that and Let

[formula]

so that, if we write T  =   exp (Nλj), then changing variables to t  =  Tu,

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=thm:Selberg]. Since the mj are fixed, this tends to zero as N  →    ∞  .

Consider

[formula]

Writing Lλj(N,u) in terms of P(λj,mj) and ε(λj,mj), we see that the term inside the modulus signs equals The integral of this in [\eqref=eq:int_difference] is clearly bounded by

[formula]

A version of the generalized Hölder inequality states that

[formula]

so long as [formula] and [formula] for all [formula].

Choosing rj  =  mj / (mj  -  αj) and sj  =  mj  /  αj, and tj  =  nj / (nj  -  βj) and uj  =  nj  /  βj, we see that we may bound the above integral by

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:apply_Selberg], if αj  ≠  0, and from Lemma [\ref=lem:mmts_primes] we have Since the sum in [\eqref=eq:holder] is over those αj and βj such that [formula], there must be at least one j with a non-zero αj or βj. Hence, as N  →    ∞  , all the terms in [\eqref=eq:holder] tend to zero. The sum is over a finite number of terms, so we may conclude that which implies assuming the limits make sense. Therefore Theorem [\ref=lem:mmts_zeta] follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:mmts_primes].
