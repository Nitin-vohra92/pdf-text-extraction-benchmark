Detecting Obscured AGN in the Distant Universe with Spitzer

Introduction

Defining complete samples of AGN, both locally and in the distant cosmological fields, has been a major ongoing goal of AGN research. Hard X-ray selection is generally considered the best way to detect both relatively uncontaminated and complete samples of AGN. At high column densities, however, the dust and gas surrounding the central engine (in combination with that located in the host galaxy) are capable of hiding virtually all accessible AGN tracers. Therefore, while the overall resolved fraction of the cosmic X-ray background (CXRB) is high, it drops with increasing energy to 60% at 6-8 keV and to 50% at >   8 keV [\citep=2004MNRAS.352L..28W] [\citep=2005MNRAS.357.1281W]. Population synthesis models of the CXRB therefore predict a significant population of heavily obscured AGN not detected in the deepest X-ray fields. For instance, [\citet=2004ApJ...616..123T] predict that current X-ray catalogs are 25% incomplete at NH  =  1023 cm- 2 and 70% incomplete at NH  =  1024 cm- 2.

Numerous attempts have been made to detect this population of heavily obscured AGN, many of which have focused on the mid-infrared (MIR) emission where the obscured radiation is re-emitted or on combinations of MIR and multi-wavelength data. We focus here on two selection techniques independent of the optical and X-ray properties of the AGN: radio-excess and MIR power-law selection. The former selects AGN whose radio emission far exceeds that of the radio-infrared correlation for star-forming galaxies, whereas the latter selects AGN whose IRAC SEDs exhibit the characteristic power-law emission expected of luminous AGN [\citep=1994ApJS...95....1E]. By focusing on the infrared and radio, wavebands where dust obscuration is minimal, we can select both unobscured AGN as well as heavily obscured AGN likely to be missed in the UV, optical, and soft X-ray bands.

To test the X-ray properties of the Spitzer-selected AGN samples, we focus on the CDF-N, the deepest X-ray field observed to date. Spitzer MIPS and IRAC images with exposures of 1400 s and 500 s, respectively, cover the full area of the Chandra 2 Ms field, as does the deep 1.4 GHz radio data of [\citet=2000ApJ...533..611R]. Optical and near-infrared imaging and photometry are available from the GOODS dataset [\citep=2004ApJ...600L..93G] as well as from the data of [\citet=2004AJ....127..180C] (UBVRIz'HK'). We assume a cosmology of (Ωm,ΩΛ,H0)=(0.3, 0.7, 72 km s- 1 Mpc- 1).

Radio-excess Sample

We use the well-known radio-infrared relation of star-forming galaxies and radio-quiet AGN, to select a sample of radio-excess AGN. [\citet=2004ApJS..154..147A] define q = log (f[formula]/f1.4 ~ GHz). For star-forming galaxies, q is tightly constrained out to z ~   1: q = 0.94 ±   0.23 after K-correction [\citep=2004ApJS..154..147A]. Galaxies with values of q well below this range (strong radio with respect to 24  emission) are unlikely to be dominated by star formation and instead are radio-emitting AGN [\citep=1995AJ....109.2318C]. We therefore set a selection threshold of q  <  0 to classify a galaxy as probably having an AGN and require a Chandra exposure of >   1 Ms to provide high X-ray sensitivity. This selection identifies 27 radio-excess AGN in the CDFN [\citep=2005ApJ...634..169D].

The radio-excess AGN lie at the typical redshift of X-ray sources in the CDF-N, z  ~  1, and (when detected in the X-ray) tend to have X-ray luminosities typical of Seyfert galaxies and SEDs dominated by the 1.6  stellar bump. Approximately 60% of these radio-excess AGN, however, are X-ray undetected in the 2 Ms Chandra catalog, even at exposures of ≥   1 Ms; 25% lack even 2σ X-ray detections. The absorbing columns to the faint X-ray-detected objects are 1022 cm- 2  <   NH <  1024 cm- 2, i.e., they are obscured but unlikely to be Compton thick. Of the 9 AGN that are either X-ray non-detected or are too close to a known X-ray source to search for weak X-ray emission, we estimate that 6 could be Compton thick. This corresponds to 22% of our sample and is consistent with predictions from the X-ray background.

MIR Power-law Sample

In the MIR, luminous AGN can often be distinguished by their characteristic power-law emission, which extends from the infrared to the ultraviolet [\citep=1979ApJ...230...79N] [\citep=1994ApJS...95....1E]. This emission is not necessarily due to a single source, but can arise from the combination of non-thermal nuclear emission and thermal emission from various nuclear dust components [\citep=1981ApJ...250...87R].

[\citet=2006ApJ...640..167A] selected a sample of 92 such sources in the CDF-S, 70% of which are hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyperLIRGS, log LIR(L[formula])  >  13) or ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, log LIR(L[formula])  >  12). Nearly half (47%) of their power-law sample were undetected in X-rays at exposures of up to 1 Ms. We use a selection similar to that of [\citet=2006ApJ...640..167A] to identify a sample of 62 high S / N, red (α  ≤   - 0.5, where [formula]) IRAC power-law galaxies in the 2 Ms CDF-N [\citep=donley07].

X-ray Properties

Of the 62 power-law galaxies, only 34 (55%) have X-ray counterparts in the 2 Ms CDF-N X-ray catalog [\citep=2003AJ....126..539A], consistent with the findings of [\citet=2006ApJ...640..167A], although 85% show evidence for X-ray emission at the ≥  2.5σ detection level. While the power-law galaxies comprise only ~  20% of the X-ray and MIR-detected AGN in the CDF-N, they make up a significant fraction of the high redshift (z  ~  2) and high luminosity X-ray AGN sample, as is demonstrated in Fig. 1. This is not surprising, as the power-law selection requires the AGN to be energetically dominant, and therefore preferentially selects the most luminous AGN. To illustrate the effect of X-ray luminosity on the AGN contribution to the optical through MIR continuum, we also plot in Fig. 1 the median rest-frame optical-MIR SEDs of the X-ray-detected members of the comparison sample, as a function of X-ray luminosity. The comparison sample consists of the 1420 IRAC sources in the CDF-N that meet our S / N and X-ray exposure cuts. Low-luminosity X-ray sources are dominated by the stellar bump in the optical-NIR bands [\citep=2004ApJS..154..155A]. The strength of this feature decreases with increasing X-ray luminosity, and disappears almost entirely at luminosities of log Lx(ergs s- 1)  >  44, where the SED takes on the characteristic power-law shape.

Obscuration

The obscured fraction (NH  >  1022 cm- 2) of the X-ray-detected power-law galaxies is ~   68%, in agreement with that of [\citet=2003ApJ...598..886U] for AGN at similar redshifts. If we consider only those power-law galaxies in the X-ray catalog, we therefore derive an obscured to unobscured ratio of ~   2:1. Adding the 10 weakly-detected power-law galaxies, all of which are likely to be obscured, we calculate an obscured fraction of ~   75%. If we further include the power-law galaxies not detected in X-rays, assuming that all are obscured, the maximum obscured ratio of power-law galaxies rises to <   4:1-5:1 (82%).

Power-law galaxies detected to high S / N in the IRAC bands account for at most ~  20 - 30% of both the MIR-detected AGN and the MIR-detected obscured AGN predicted by the X-ray luminosity function synthesis models of [\citet=2006ApJ...640..603T] down to 24  flux densities of 80 μJy. The majority of obscured AGN should therefore have SEDs dominated by the host galaxy, or red power-law SEDs that fall below the IRAC detection limit.

Comparison to IRAC Color-Selection

We plot in Fig. 2 the position of the power-law galaxies with respect to the IRAC AGN color cuts of [\citet=2004ApJS..154..166L] and [\citet=2005ApJ...631..163S], designed for relatively shallow surveys. All of the power-law galaxies lie within both the Lacy et al. and Stern et al. color regions, and as such, they comprise a subset of the color-selected MIR sources. While the color-selected AGN samples in the CDF-N comprise a higher fraction of high-luminosity AGN than the power-law selected sample (see Fig. 1), they also appear to suffer from a higher degree of contamination from star-forming galaxies (see Table 1). This is not surprising, given the behavior of the star-forming and AGN templates shown in Fig. 2 [\citep=donley07]. The star-forming templates enter the AGN selection regions at both low and high redshifts, whereas they fall outside of the more stringent power-law region at z < 2.8.

Summary

We present the results of a Spitzer search for AGN in the Chandra Deep Field-North. We focus on two selection techniques independent of the optical and X-ray properties of the sources. The first is radio-excess selection, in which we select sources whose radio emission far exceeds that of the radio-infrared correlation. In the CDF-N, we detect 27 radio-excess AGN. These sources tend to lie at z  ~  1 and have SEDs dominated by the 1.6  stellar bump. Only 40% are detected in the X-ray at exposures of >  1 Ms, although 75% show signs of X-ray emission at the > 2σ detection level. Those with X-ray counterparts have Seyfert-like X-ray luminosities. The majority of the radio-excess AGN are consistent with being obscured (NH  >  1022 cm- 2), and 20% are potentially Compton-thick.

The second selection technique is MIR power-law selection, in which we select sources with red (α  <   - 0.5) IRAC power-law SEDs. The sources selected in this way tend have higher redshifts (z  ~  2) and X-ray luminosities than the radio-excess sample. The IRAC power-law selection recovers a significant fraction of the most X-ray luminous AGN in the CDF-N. Despite this, only 55% of the power-law galaxies are detected in the X-ray, with 15% remaining undetected down to the > 2.5σ detection level. These X-ray detection fractions are similar to those of the radio-excess AGN, even though there is almost no overlap in the two samples. This suggests that a relatively low X-ray detection rate may be a common feature for AGN samples selected independently of their optical and X-ray properties, regardless of luminosity or redshift.

A study of the intrinsic obscuration of the power-law galaxies suggests that as many as 82% (4:1 - 5:1) are obscured. The number densities of these sources indicate that the power-law sample comprises only 20-30% of the MIPS-detected obscured AGN population. The remaining AGN are likely to have SEDs dominated by the host galaxy, like those of the radio-excess sample.

The power-law galaxies discussed here comprise a subset of AGN selected via the IRAC color-selection criteria of [\citet=2004ApJS..154..166L] and [\citet=2005ApJ...631..163S]. While larger in number than the power-law sample, the color-selected samples in the CDF-N appear to suffer from a higher degree of contamination from star-forming galaxies. By applying additional SED constraints to a color-selected sample, or by requiring either a 24  detection or AGN-like optical/X-ray colors, one can create both a more complete and reliable sample of MIR-selected AGN, even in the deepest astronomical fields. Doing so is crucial if we are to constrain the fraction of heavily obscured AGN in the distant universe and determine their contribution to the accretion history of the universe.
