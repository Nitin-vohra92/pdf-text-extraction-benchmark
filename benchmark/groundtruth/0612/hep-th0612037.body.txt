Quantum Gravity Effects in Rotating Black Holes

Introduction

The effective average action has been used for detailed studies of the nonperturbative renormalization behavior of Quantum Einstein Gravity, in particular in the context of the asymptotic safety scenario [\cite=mr] [\cite=as]. As a first application of the scale dependent Newton constant derived in [\cite=mr], quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime were discussed in [\cite=Bonanno-Reuter]. Indications were found that, due to quantum effects, the Hawking evaporation process stops once the mass of the black hole is of the order of the Planck mass [\cite=Bonanno-Reuter] [\cite=evap]. In this note we report on some aspects of the corresponding analysis for Kerr black holes [\cite=long].

Renormalization Group Improvement

The (truncated) renormalization group (RG) equation for the average action provides us with a running Newton constant [formula] where the mass parameter k sets the scale of the "coarse graining" which has been performed. Technically it is implemented as an infrared cutoff in the underlying functional integral over all metrics. In the improvement approach of [\cite=Bonanno-Reuter] one tries to relate k to the geometrical properties of the system under consideration. More concretely, one sets up a correspondence [formula] between scales and spacetime points P. A still rather general ansatz for this correspondence is [formula], where [formula] is the proper length of a spacetime curve C related to P which is computed with respect to the classical metric. This ansatz is manifestly diffeomorphism invariant, and thanks to its nonlocal character it is potentially capable of mimicking certain (not explicitly known) nonlocal terms in the average action. In [\cite=long] various choices for C are discussed, for instance a radial path from the center of the black hole to P. Using standard Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates, [formula] becomes a function [formula]. It turns out [\cite=long] that within the expected domain of reliability of this approach the θ  -  dependence of the invariant distance is inessential and [formula] depends on the radial coordinate only. Asymptotically, [formula]. For a "semi-quantitative" analysis we used the approximation for [formula] given by [formula] [\cite=Bonanno-Reuter]. It entails the position dependent Newton constant [formula]. Here w and [formula] are positive constants, and [formula] is the standard Newton constant. The "RG improvement" consists in substituting [formula] in the classical Kerr solution. The resulting metric of the RG improved Kerr spacetime reads, in BL coordinates,

[formula]

The general structure of this metric, as well as the abbreviations [formula], [formula], are as in the classical case. The only place where [formula] appears is in [formula].

Critical Surfaces of the Improved Kerr Metric

The spacetime described by ds2imp has two infinite redshift surfaces [formula] at radii [formula] given by [formula]. We denote them by S±. The outer one, S+, is the static limit surface. Furthermore, the spacetime has two event horizons (grr = 0, Δ = 0) with radii r = r± to be obtained from [formula]. We denote the inner (outer) horizon by H- (H+). In Fig. 1 we plot the radii r± and rS± ([formula]) in the equatorial plane for the approximation [formula], and we compare them to the classical values ([formula]=0). The upper and lower branches of the curves correspond to S+, H+ and S-, H-, respectively. We observe that for small enough M the horizons coalesce and then disappear, and similarly for S± at even lower masses. The coalescence of H± and S± occur for M of the order of MPl where the applicability of the method becomes questionable. It can be safely applied for r  ≫  lPl if M  ≫  mPl and a  ≪  MG0 where the quantum corrections are small.

Antiscreening and Smarr's Formula

Since the improved Kerr metric is known explicitly, we can compute its Einstein tensor and write it in the form [formula], thus defining an effective energy-momentum tensor [formula] for the quantum fluctuations which drive the renormalization group evolution. Nevertheless, improved vacuum black holes are in many respects quite different from classical ones in presence of matter. The reason is that [formula] does not have any of the standard positivity properties which are crucial in black hole thermodynamics, for instance. Corrections to the mass MH and angular momentum JH of the Kerr black hole coming from the "pseudo-matter" described by [formula] can be calculated by performing the Komar integrals at the event horizon: [formula] ,  [formula]. Here tβ and φβ are the Killing vectors associated to stationarity and axial symmetry, respectively. One finds:

[formula]

[formula]

For the case of the mass, ([\ref=M_H_Res]) tells us that, due to quantum fluctuations, the classical mass M is decreased to a value MH < M for every possible running of the Newton's constant [\cite=long]. This can be interpreted due to the antiscreening character of quantum gravity [\cite=mr]. Remarkably enough, Smarr's formula still holds in its classical form [formula]. For the quantum corrected black hole, the horizon's angular frequency, surface gravity, and area are given by [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The classical appearance of these formulas (except for the G'-term in κ) is deceptive: The radius [formula] depends on the parameters of the black hole, and this relationship is modified by the renormalization effects.

Summary

We explained how quantum gravity effects in the spacetime of rotating black holes can be taken into account by a RG improvement of the classical Kerr solution. We discussed the Black hole's critical surfaces as well as the "gravitational dressing" of its mass and angular momentum. Further properties of the improved Kerr black hole, in particular its thermodynamics and Penrose process, will be described in ref. [\cite=long].
