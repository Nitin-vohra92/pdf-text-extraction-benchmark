The twin paradox on the photon sphere

The resolution of the classical twin paradox is that the travelling twin must suffer an acceleration since he stops, turns around and returns to his never accelerating twin brother. The physical situation of the twins is therefore not the same, and indeed, the one who accelerates is younger on reunion. Barrow and Levin [\cite=barrow], see also [\cite=bajtlik], discussed a clever version of the paradox in compact spaces, with the twins moving with zero acceleration on a closed path. Compactness of the space defines a global standard of rest, and the twin moving faster with respect to this standard is younger on reunion. In this Note we consider still another example of the twin paradox. Twins move with constant velocity along a circular photon path in the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this case, as shown by Abramowicz and Lasota [\cite=lasota], see also [\cite=carter], they all have the same non-zero acceleration. We will show that the one who moves faster with respect to the standard of rest (given by the Killing symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime) is younger on reunion.

In Schwarzschild coordinates, the Schwarzschild metric has the form,

[formula]

The metric depends neither on the time coordinate t, nor on the azimuthal coordinate φ. It is convenient to invariantly express these time and azimuthal symmetries in terms of two Killing vector fields,

[formula]

Note that ηiηi  =  gtt  =  1 - rG / r, ξiξi  =  gφφ  =    -   sin 2θ  r2. The unit timelike vector,

[formula]

defines the static observers outside the event horizon r = rG. They provide the absolute standard of rest in Schwarzschild spacetime.

Circular orbits r  =  const on equatorial plane θ  =  π / 2 have the only non zero components [formula] and [formula]. They are invariantly defined by,

[formula]

Since UiUi = 1, the normalization is 1 / A2  =  ηiηi  +  Ω2ξiξi.

The velocity with respect to the absolute standard of rest (static observers) is defined by,

[formula]

and the corresponding speed V (or ṽ) is defined by

[formula]

Note that V  =  cβ and ṽ  =  cβγ in terms of the Lorentz β and [formula]. From the above definitions one calculates,

[formula]

The quantity R is the "distance from the rotation axis".

The acceleration on an orbit described by ([\ref=velocity]) is

[formula]

One may define the "gravitational potential" Φ by the invariant expression

[formula]

and then put the acceleration formula ([\ref=acceleration]) into a form identical with its Newtonian version,

[formula]

From this equation one calculates that for the free (geodesic) motion, the orbital velocity V2 equals in the Schwarzschild spacetime,

[formula]

In particular, for r  =  (3 / 2)rG it is V2  =  1, which therefore corresponds to a free, circular motion of photons. The r  =  (3 / 2)rG circles are called the photon circles, and one also speaks about the photon sphere.

Abramowicz and Lasota [\cite=lasota] noticed that [formula] on the photon circle, and they deduced from ([\ref=acceleration-Newtonian]) that on the photon circle acceleration does not depend on the orbital velocity: for all steady, non-geodesic, circular motions along r  =  (3 / 2)rG the acceleration takes the universal value (we give its r component only, as all other components are zero),

[formula]

This suggests another version of the twin paradox. At the time t  =  t0 two identical twins meet. Because they move with two different, constant, orbital velocities V1 and V2 along the same photon circle, they will certainly meet again. Who will be younger on reunion at the time t = t0  +  Δ  t? Unlike in the classical version of the twin paradox, but similarly as in the case of compact space considered by Barrow and Levin [\cite=barrow], the acceleration a cannot be the answer here, as the two twins have the same acceleration. In the compact space they all have a  =  0, and on the photon circle they have a  =  a* given by equation ([\ref=universal]). Indeed, like in the compact space, the answer is the velocity, the absolute velocity with respect to the absolute standard of rest: as we shall see, on reunion the twin who moves faster with respect to the standard of rest is younger. In the compact space, as explained by Barrow and Levin, there is no local standard of rest, but there is a global one. In the case of photon circle, the standard of rest is local, and given by the Killing symmetry.

The proper time elapsed from separation to reunion is,

[formula]

From this, one finally deduces,

[formula]

which proves the point: the twin who moves faster is younger on reunion.
