Complex variables for separation of Hamilton-Jacobi equation on three-dimensional Minkowski space

Introduction

The separability of the geodesic Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation in some orthogonal coordinate system in n-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds is characterized by a Killing-Stäckel (KS) algebra of n (including the metric tensor) independent, commuting, simultaneously diagonalized Killing two-tensors with common closed eigenforms that define the separable hypersurfaces (see [\cite=Ben] and references therein).

On the three-dimensional Euclidean space eleven such separable coordinate systems exist, classified first in [\cite=E]. On the three-dimensional Minkowski space many more exist, up to 82 according to [\cite=Hi]. Differently from the euclidean case, several of these systems are undefined in open subsets of the whole space, due to the fact that eigenforms of the KS-algebra can be there complex valued (the same happens in two-dimensional Minkowski space). In [\cite=complex] we define complex variables for this cases and develop a geometric theory of separation for HJ equation in complex variables on real pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with exhaustive examples for the two-dimensional Minkowski space. In the present paper we introduce complex separable variables on three-dimensional Minkowski space through a meaningful example and by making use of results exposed in [\cite=CRCG] and [\cite=arkiv] where separable coordinates are directly related to the eigenvalues of a basis of their KS algebra. These variables fit naturally with the standard real separable coordinate systems. A complete setting of complex separable variables on three-dimensional Minkowski space is still to be done. In Sections 2 and 3 we recall shortly the results of [\cite=complex], Section 4 is devoted to the example.

Definitions and first results

A tensor [formula] on a real n-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold Q (with real coordinates (qi) and metric tensor [formula]) is called a Killing tensor if its covariant components satisfy the equation [formula]. A classical characteristic Killing tensor is a Killing two-tensor [formula] that (in a open subset of Q) admits n pointwise distinct real functions (λi) and n functionally independent real functions (zi) that satisfy (with no summation over i) the equations:

[formula]

Locally, to any characteristic Killing tensor can be associated a KS-algebra, and vice-versa.

In the paper [\cite=complex] it was shown how to drop the requirement that the functions (λi) and (zi) are real and how the Stäckel-Eisenhart theory and the Levi-Civita criterion can be extended to this case, without to complexify the manifold Q.

Because [formula] and [formula] are both symmetric with real coefficients, if zi satisfies the relation ([\ref=autovet]) also its complex conjugate i satisfies the same relation. Hence, the functions (zi) with a non-vanishing imaginary part arise in pairs and the n complex-valued functions (zi) define, through their real and imaginary parts, n real-valued coordinates.

It is well known that, if (pi) are the conjugate momenta of the coordinates (qi) on [formula], one can define the the momenta conjugate to the variables zi by using the Jacobian matrix [formula] and its inverse [formula] with components Jji:

[formula]

Moreover, to the variables (zi,Pi) are associated the, eventually complex-valued, vector fields:

[formula]

Separation of variables for Hamilton-Jacobi equation

A complete integral of the equation ([\ref=HJ]) is a solution W(zi,cj) of ([\ref=HJ]), where (cj) are n real-valued parameters, satisfying

[formula]

A complete integral W(zi,cj) is (additively) separated in the variables (zi) if

[formula]

In the paper [\cite=complex] is shown that an analogous of the Levi-Civita criterion [\cite=LC] holds also in the complex case:

Given a basis [formula] of a KS-algebra, and denoted by λik the eigenvalues of [formula] then, because the [formula] are simultaneously diagonalized, the HJ equations associated to them can be set in the matrix form

[formula]

The equations obtained by inverting ([\ref=Systemsep]) admit complete separated solutions if and only if, denoting by [formula] the inverse of the matrix in the left side of ([\ref=Systemsep]), the i-th row of [formula] depends on the variable zi only. Such a matrix is called Stäckel matrix.

Classical results state that: In [\cite=complex] we show that the previous result holds also in the complex setting.

Example

Orthogonal separable coordinates for HJ equation in the three-dimensional Minkowski space are described and classified in several papers by Kalnins and Miller [\cite=Kal], [\cite=KM] and more details are given in [\cite=Hi] where the separable systems are defined according to the scheme given in [\cite=KM] and their singular sets are shown. The papers [\cite=CRCG], [\cite=arkiv] show how the real eigenvalues of any basis of a Killing-Stäckel algebra can be combined together to build functions depending each on one only of the associated non-ignorable separable coordinated and that, in the case when all that functions are constants or undefined, the corresponding separable coordinate is ignorable. In the three-dimensional case, if (λi1) and (λi2) are the eigenvalues of a basis of a KS-algebra, the relevant functions depending on the single separable coordinate zh are

[formula]

with [formula] and i = h + 1, j = h + 2 mod 3. In this paper we consider here separable systems without ignorable coordinates (asymmetric systems) only. It is easy to see from [\cite=CRCG], [\cite=arkiv] that the functions ([\ref=funz]) behave in the same way also in the complex case, being the proof of this property based on the Killing-Eisenhart equations only (see the previous section). Therefore, the functions ([\ref=funz]) depend on only one of the separable variables, real or complex, and can be used to define exactly this variable. For example, let us consider in the Minkowski three-dimensional space the real systems (μ,ν,ρ) (the (B.1.c) in [\cite=Hi], see also the (B.1.d) in the same paper, only slightly different) defined in pseudo-cartesian coordinates (t,x,y) by

[formula]

where inequalities involving (μ,ν,σ) and 0,1,a, make the distinction among systems defined in some open sets of the space separated by singular surfaces, "horizons" in [\cite=Hi], and assure here the reality of the greek variables that remain undefined in some other open sets.

The components of the metric tensor in the coordinates (μ,ν,σ) are given by

[formula]

[formula]

To all these systems corresponds the KS algebra generated by the metric [formula] and the Killing tensors [formula] and [formula] with components, in (t,x,y) coordinates:

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

whose eigenvalues λi1 and λi2, where (μ,ν,ρ) are defined, are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively (we remark "en passant" that the eigenvalues of above reveal a structure analogue to that of a Benenti system [\cite=sb], not yet studied in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds). It is possible to see that the singular surfaces coincide with the points where the dimension of the KS algebra is < 3, i.e. where

[formula]

and that in the portions of the space where ([\ref=def]) are undefined the KS algebra has a couple of complex conjugated eigenforms and eigenvalues. The functions ([\ref=funz]) provide the link between the eigenvalues and the separable coordinates, indeed, as instance,

[formula]

We consider now the case when some of the common eigenforms of [formula] and [formula] are complex. If, for example, λ11  =  λ̄21, λ12  =  λ̄22 and λ31, λ32 are real we have f211  =  212 and f213 real. These functions fit with the complex variables that we introduced in the previous sections and via ([\ref=A]) extend naturally the (μ,ν,ρ) variables in the whole Minkowski space deprived of the singular surfaces, having consequently, μ  =   and ρ real. It is remarkable that the f21i and ([\ref=def]) define always the same variables (μ,ν,ρ) no matter if they are real or complex. In conclusion, the complex variables introduced above not only allow complete separation of variables for HJ equation where it is impossible to define real separable coordinates, but also represent the natural extension of the latter to the whole space (apart the singular surfaces). The mechanism of separation of variables and the integration of the separate complete integral of the HJ equations using complex variables are described in [\cite=complex].
