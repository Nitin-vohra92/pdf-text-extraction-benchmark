Affine Geometric Crystal of type G(1)2

Introduction

Geometric crystal is an object defined over certain algebraic (or ind-)variety which holds an analogous structure to Kashiwara's crystal ([\cite=BK],[\cite=N]). Precisely, for a fixed Cartan data (A,{αi}i∈I,{hi}ı∈I), a geometric crystal consists of an ind-variety X over the complex number [formula], a rational [formula]-action [formula] and rational functions [formula] (i∈I), which satisfy certain conditions (see Definition [\ref=def-gc]). It has many similarity to the theory of crystals, e.g., some product structure, Weyl group actions, R-matrices, etc. Furthermore, there is a more direct correspondence between geometric crystals and crystals, called tropicalization/ ultra-discretization procedure (see ).

In [\cite=KNO], we presented certain conjecture. In order to mention it precisely, we need to prepare the following: Let G (resp. [formula]) be the affine Kac-Moody group (resp. algebra) associated with a generalized Cartan matrix A = (aij)i,j∈I. Let B± be the Borel subgroup and T the maximal torus. Set [formula], and let [formula] be the image of [formula] by the group morphism [formula] induced by the simple coroot [formula] as in [\ref=KM]. We set [formula]. Let W (resp. [formula]) be the Weyl group (resp. the extended Weyl group) associated with [formula]. The Schubert cell [formula] [formula] is birationally isomorphic to the variety

[formula]

and Xw has a natural geometric crystal structure ([\cite=BK], [\cite=N]),

We choose 0∈I as in [\cite=K0], and let [formula] be the set of level 0 fundamental weights. Let W(ϖi) be the fundamental representation of [formula] with ϖi as an extremal weight ([\cite=K0]). Let us denote its reduction at q = 1 by the same notation W(ϖi). It is a finite-dimensional [formula]-module. Note that though the representation W(ϖi) is irreducible over [formula], the module W(ϖi) at q = 1 for [formula] is not necessarily an irreducible [formula]-module. We set [formula].

For any i∈I, define

[formula]

Then the translation [formula] belongs to [formula] (see [\cite=KNO]). For a subset J of I, let us denote by [formula] the subalgebra of [formula] generated by {ei,fi}i∈J. For an integral weight μ, define [formula].

For any i∈I, there exist a unique variety X endowed with a positive [formula]-geometric crystal structure and a rational mapping [formula] satisfying the following property:

for an arbitrary extremal vector u∈W(ϖi)μ, writing the translation [formula] as [formula] with a Dynkin diagram automorphism ι and [formula], there exists a birational mapping ξ:B-w  →  X such that ξ is a morphism of [formula]-geometric crystals and that the composition [formula] coincides with [formula], where [formula] is the line including u,

the ultra-discretization of X is isomorphic to the crystal B∞(ϖi) of the Langlands dual [formula].

In [\cite=KNO], we constructed a positive geometric crystal [formula] associated with the fundamental representation W(ϖ1) for affine Lie algebras [formula] [formula] with this conjecture as a guide. In that article, we also show that the ultra-discretization limit of [formula] is isomorphic to the limit of certain coherent family of perfect crystals for [formula] the Langlands dual of [formula].

In this article, we shall construct such geometric crystal for [formula]. Its explicit form is given in , which is rather complicated but we shall see that it is positive, which implies that the former half of our conjecture is affirmative for [formula] and the i = 1-case. Then we obtain its ultra-discretization limit and we expect that it is isomorphic to the limit of certain coherent family of perfect crystals of type [formula] [\cite=KMOY].

Geometric crystals

In this section, we review Kac-Moody groups and geometric crystals following [\cite=PK], [\cite=Ku2], [\cite=BK]

Kac-Moody algebras and Kac-Moody groups

Fix a symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrix A = (aij)i,j∈I with a finite index set I. Let [formula] be the associated root data, where [formula] is a vector space over [formula] and [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent satisfying [formula].

The Kac-Moody Lie algebra [formula] associated with A is the Lie algebra over [formula] generated by [formula], the Chevalley generators ei and fi (i∈I) with the usual defining relations ([\cite=KP],[\cite=PK]). There is the root space decomposition [formula]. Denote the set of roots by [formula]. Set [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. An element of Δ+ is called a positive root. Let [formula] be a weight lattice such that [formula], whose element is called a weight.

Define simple reflections [formula] (i∈I) by [formula], which generate the Weyl group W. It induces the action of W on [formula] by [formula]. Set Δre: = {w(αi)|w∈W,    i∈I}, whose element is called a real root.

Let [formula] be the derived Lie algebra of [formula] and let G be the Kac-Moody group associated with [formula]([\cite=PK]). Let [formula] (α∈Δre) be the one-parameter subgroup of G. The group G is generated by Uα (α∈Δre). Let U± be the subgroup generated by U±  α ([formula]), i.e., U±: = 〈U±  α|α∈Δre+〉.

For any i∈I, there exists a unique homomorphism; [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Set [formula], xi(t): =  exp (tei), yi(t): =  exp (tfi), [formula], [formula] and Ni: = NGi(Ti). Let T (resp. N) be the subgroup of G with the Lie algebra [formula] (resp. generated by the Ni's), which is called a maximal torus in G, and let B± = U±T be the Borel subgroup of G. We have the isomorphism [formula] defined by φ(si) = NiT / T. An element [formula] is in NG(T), which is a representative of si∈W = NG(T) / T.

Geometric crystals

Let W be the Weyl group associated with [formula]. Define R(w) for w∈W by

[formula]

where l is the length of w. Then R(w) is the set of reduced words of w.

Let X be an ind-variety , [formula] and [formula] (i∈I) rational functions on X, and [formula] ((c,x)  ↦  eci(x)) a rational [formula]-action.

For a word [formula] (w∈W), set [formula] (1  ≤  j  ≤  l) and

[formula]

Note that the condition (iii) as above is equivalent to the following so-called Verma relations:

[formula]

Note that the last formula is different from the one in [\cite=BK], [\cite=N], [\cite=N2] which seems to be incorrect. The formula here may be correct.

Geometric crystal on Schubert cell

Let w∈W be a Weyl group element and take a reduced expression [formula]. Let X: = G / B be the flag variety, which is an ind-variety and Xw  ⊂  X the Schubert cell associated with w, which has a natural geometric crystal structure ([\cite=BK],[\cite=N]). For [formula], set

[formula]

which has a geometric crystal structure([\cite=N]) isomorphic to Xw. The explicit forms of the action eci, the rational function εi and γi on [formula] are given by

[formula]

Positive structure,   Ultra-discretizations    and   Tropicalizations

Let us recall the notions of positive structure, ultra-discretization and tropicalization.

The setting below is same as [\cite=KNO]. Let [formula] be an algebraic torus over [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula]) be the lattice of characters (resp. co-characters) of T. Set [formula] and define

[formula]

where  deg  is the degree of poles at c =   ∞  . Here note that for [formula], we have

[formula]

A non-zero rational function on an algebraic torus T is called positive if it is written as g / h where g and h are a positive linear combination of characters of T. Denote by Mor+(T,T') the set of positive rational morphisms from T to T'.

For any f∈Mor+(T1,T2) and g∈Mor+(T2,T3), the composition [formula] is well-defined and belongs to Mor+(T1,T3).

By Lemma [\ref=TTT], we can define a category T+ whose objects are algebraic tori over [formula] and arrows are positive rational morphisms.

Let f:T  →  T' be a positive rational morphism of algebraic tori T and T'. We define a map :X*(T)  →  X*(T') by

[formula]

where χ∈X*(T') and ξ∈X*(T).

For any algebraic tori T1, T2, T3, and positive rational morphisms f∈Mor+(T1,T2), g∈Mor+(T2,T3), we have [formula]

By this lemma, we obtain a functor

[formula]

Let θ:T  →  X be a positive structure on a geometric crystal χ = (X,{ei}i∈I, {wti}i∈I,{εi}i∈I). Applying the functor UD to positive rational morphisms [formula] and [formula] (the notations are as above), we obtain

[formula]

Now, for given positive structure θ:T'  →  X on a geometric crystal χ = (X,{ei}i∈I, {wti}i∈I,{εi}i∈I), we associate the quadruple (X*(T'),{ẽi}i∈I,{wti}i∈I,{εi}i∈I) with a free pre-crystal structure (see [\cite=BK]) and denote it by UDθ,T'(χ). We have the following theorem:

For any geometric crystal χ = (X,{ei}i∈I,{γi}i∈I, {εi}i∈I) and positive structure θ:T'  →  X, the associated pre-crystal UDθ,T'(χ) = (X*(T'),{ei}i∈I,{wti}i∈I,{εi}i∈I) is a crystal (see [\cite=BK])

Now, let GC+ be a category whose object is a triplet (χ,T',θ) where χ = (X,{ei},{γi},{εi}) is a geometric crystal and θ:T'  →  X is a positive structure on χ, and morphism f:(χ1,T'1,θ1)  →  (χ2,T'2,θ2) is given by a morphism φ:X1  →  X2 ([formula]) such that

[formula]

is a positive rational morphism. Let CR be a category of crystals. Then by the theorem above, we have

UDθ,T' as above defines a functor

[formula]

We call the functor UD "ultra-discretization" as [\cite=N],[\cite=N2] instead of "tropicalization" as in [\cite=BK]. And for a crystal B, if there exists a geometric crystal χ and a positive structure θ:T'  →  X on χ such that [formula] as crystals, we call an object (χ,T',θ) in GC+ a tropicalization of B, where it is not known that this correspondence is a functor.

Limit of perfect crystals

We review limit of perfect crystals following [\cite=KKM]. (See also [\cite=KMN1],[\cite=KMN2]).

Crystals

First we review the theory of crystals, which is the notion obtained by abstracting the combinatorial properties of crystal bases. The following tensor product structure is one of the most crucial properties of crystals.

Let B1 and B2 be crystals. Set [formula]. Then we have

[formula] is a crystal.

For b1∈B1 and b2∈B2, we have

[formula]

[formula]

If (L,B) is a crystal base, then B is a crystal. Hence, for the crystal base (L(  ∞  ),B(  ∞  )) of the nilpotent subalgebra [formula] of the quantum algebra [formula], B(  ∞  ) is a crystal.

For λ∈P, set [formula]. We define a crystal structure on [formula] by

[formula]

Affine weights

Let [formula] be an affine Lie algebra. The sets [formula], {αi}i∈I and [formula] be as in [\ref=KM]. We take [formula]. Let δ∈Q+ be the unique element satisfying [formula] and [formula] be the canonical central element satisfying [formula]. We write ([\cite=Kac])

[formula]

Let (  ,  ) be the non-degenerate W-invariant symmetric bilinear form on [formula] normalized by [formula] for [formula]. Let us set [formula] and let [formula] be the canonical projection. Here we have [formula]. Set [formula], [formula]. Since (δ,δ) = 0, we have a positive-definite symmetric form on [formula] induced by the one on [formula]. Let [formula] (i∈I) be a classical weight such that [formula], which is called a fundamental weight. We choose P so that Pcl: = cl(P) coincides with [formula] and we call Pcl a classical weight lattice.

Definitions of perfect crystal and its limit

Let [formula] be an affine Lie algebra, Pcl be a classical weight lattice as above and set [formula] [formula].

Let [formula] be a family of perfect crystals of level l and set J: = {(l,b)|l > 0,  b∈Bminl}. As for the crystal [formula], see Example [\ref=tlm]. If a limit exists for a family {Bl}, we say that {Bl} is a coherent family of perfect crystals.

The following is one of the most important properties of limit of perfect crystals.

Fundamental Representations

Fundamental representation W(ϖ1)

Let [formula] be the canonical central element in an affine Lie algebra [formula] (see [\cite=Kac]), {Λi|i∈I} the set of fundamental weight as in the previous section and [formula] the (level 0)fundamental weight.

Let V(ϖ1) be the extremal weight module of [formula] associated with ϖ1 ([\cite=K0]) and [formula] the fundamental representation of [formula] where z1 is a [formula]-linear automorhism on V(ϖ1) (see [\cite=K0]).

By [\cite=K0], W(ϖ1) is an finite-dimensional irreducible integrable [formula]-module and has a global basis with a simple crystal. Thus, we can consider the specialization q = 1 and obtain the finite-dimensional [formula]-module W(ϖ1), which we call a fundamental representation of [formula] and use the same notation as above.

We shall present the explicit form of W(ϖ1) for [formula].

W(ϖ1) for [formula]

The Cartan matrix A = (ai,j)i,j = 0,1,2 of type [formula] is as follows:

[formula]

Then the simple roots are

[formula]

and the Dynkin diagram is:

[formula]

The [formula]-module W(ϖ1) is a 15 dimensional module with the basis,

[formula]

The explicit form of W(ϖ1) is given in [\cite=Y], which slightly differs from our description below.

[formula]

The actions of ei and fi on these basis vectors are given as follows:

[formula]

where we only give non-trivial actions and the other actions are trivial. We can easily check that these define the module W(ϖ1) by direct calculations.

Affine Geometric Crystal [formula]

We shall construct the affine geometric crystal [formula] in W(ϖ1) explicitly.

For [formula], let t(ξ) be the shift as in [\cite=K0]. Then we have

[formula]

Associated with these Weyl group elements w1 and w2, we define algebraic varieties [formula] and [formula] respectively:

[formula]

Due to the explicit forms of fi's on W(ϖ1) as above, we have f30 = 0, f31 = 0 and f42 = 0 and then

[formula]

Thus, we can get explicit forms of v1(x)∈V1 and v2(y)∈V2. Set

[formula]

Then by direct calculations, we have

The rational function [formula] and [formula] are given as:

[formula]

[formula]

Now we solve the equation

[formula]

where a(x) is a rational function in [formula]. Though this equation is over-determined, we can solve it and obtain the explicit form of the unique solution as follows:

By the direct calculations, we obtain the results. Indeed, certain computer softwares are useful to the calculations.

Here we obtain the positive birational isomorphism [formula] (v1(x)  ↦  v2(y)) and its inverse [formula] as above. The actions of ec0 on v2(y) (respectively γ0(v2(y)) and ε0(v2(y))) are induced from the ones on Y2(y2)Y1(y1)Y2(y4)Y1(y3)Y0(y0)Y1(y5) as an element of the geometric crystal V2 since [formula]. Now, we define the action ec0 on v1(x) by

[formula]

We also define γ0(v1(x)) and ε0(v1(x)) by

[formula]

Together with ([\ref=e0]), ([\ref=wt0]) on V1, we obtain a positive affine geometric crystal χ: = (V1,{ei}i∈I,{γi}i∈I,{εi}i∈I) (I = {0,1,2}), whose explicit form is as follows: first we have eci, γi and εi for i = 1,2 from the formula ([\ref=eici]), ([\ref=vep-i]) and ([\ref=gamma-i]).

[formula]

We also have ec0, ε0 and γ0 on v1(x) as:

[formula]

Calculating directly, we know that χ: = (V1,{eci}i∈I,{γi}i∈I, {εi}i∈I) satisfies the relations in Definition [\ref=def-gc] and then it is a geometric crystal. The positivity is immediate from the above formulae.

Here we denote the positive structure on χ by θ:V1  →  T. Then by Corollary [\ref=cor-posi] we obtain the ultra-discretization UD(χ,T,θ), which is a Kashiwara's crystal. In [\cite=KNO], we show that such crystal is isomorphic to the limit of certain perfect crystal for the Langlands dual algebra. So we present the following conjecture:

The crystal UD(χ,T,θ) as above is the limit of coherent family of perfect crystals of type [formula] in [\cite=KMOY].
