Fermat's principle in quantum gravitational optics

Introduction

Quantum Gravitational Optics (QGO) is the term coined for the studies incorporating photon propagation in curved space-times in the presence of QED vacuum polarization in the lowest (leading) order [\cite=1] [\cite=2]. The quantum corrections introduce null cone modifications which in general alter the propagation characteristics of photons leading to cases in which they could travel at speeds greater than unity. It is expected that the more complex the space-time is, the more complex should be its curvature coupling to these quantum effects. In line with the above expectation, this phenomenon has been studied in Schwarzschild, Robertson-Walker and gravitational wave backgrounds [\cite=1] as well as in Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr black hole space-times [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. It is found that except for the case of de Sitter space there may be certain directions and polarizations in which photons travel at speeds greater than unity. It is also shown that in the case of static topological black holes, the velocity shift of photons is the same as in the Reissner-Nordstrom case and the vacuum polarized photons are not sensitive to the asymptotic behavior or topological structure of space-time while for radiating topological black hole backgrounds, the light cone condition and velocity shifts depend on the topological structure [\cite=5]. In a recent paper, taking the vacuum polarization into account the propagation of a bundle of rays in a background gravitational field has been studied through the perturbative deformation of the Raychaudhuri equation [\cite=6]. However, there are other important phenomena predicted in the framework of general relativity (GR) while semiclassical corrections such as the QED interactions mentioned above are taken into account. Despite the fact that QGO corrections are expected to be small, the comparison between the classical (GR) and semiclassical (QGO) theories can be conducted on the basis of higher order effects which deserve attention from both the theoretical and observational points of view. In the realm of photon propagation, the observational testbeds are usually provided in the context of gravitational lensing through the impressive development of technical capabilities. Hence a special treatment of lensing phenomena could be provided through the consideration of these quantum effects. Following a particular version of Fermat's principle for stationary space-times, we obtain an equation for the spatial light paths which demonstrates why, for a QED photon, a curved background acts as if it is an anisotropic medium with its own polarization dependent refractive index.

In what follows, first we give a brief account of QGO. Then, based on Fermat's principle in the context of 1 + 3 (threading) formulation of space-time decomposition, it is shown how the basic modifications introduced by the theory lead to the corrections on the photon spatial trajectories and the spacetime refractive index. After introducing an intriguing expression for an effective local refractive index in section 3, it is shown in section 4 that its first order correction is proportional to the null cone modification thereby leading to two new theorems on a)-polarization summed shift of refractive indices and b)-photons travelling normal to the horizon. In section 5 using the results of Tsai and Erber [\cite=Tsai] on the refractive indices of photons of arbitrary frequency propagating in a background magnetic field, gravitational and electromagnetic birefringence are compared. In section 6 the equation of spatial light paths in the presence of the above QGO effects is given. The results are summarized and discussed in the last section.

Vacuum polarized photon propagation in a curved background

Vacuum polarization is an effect in which the photon exists as a virtual e+e- pair for a short time. This virtual transition assigns photons with an effective size of O(λc), where λc is the Compton wavelength of the electron [\cite=1]. The photon propagation will be affected by gravity if the scale of space-time curvature L is comparable to λc. Ignoring the vacuum polarization, the equivalence principle leads to the photon propagation at the speed of light on the space-time null geodesics. But when the pair production is taken into account, the equivalence principle is violated in such a way that the photon trajectories are modified and superluminal (photon) propagation becomes a possibility. All this could happen without necessarily breaking down the causality [\cite=2]. Considering the vacuum polarization, the first order correction to the electromagnetic action

[formula]

is given by

[formula]

in which

[formula]

are perturbative coefficients of O(α), me is the electron mass and α is the fine structure constant. Expression ([\ref=Drumhath]) is called Drummond-Hathrell action [\cite=1]. The first three terms show the influence of curvature while the last one, representing the off-mass-shell effects (in the vacuum polarization), exists even in the flat spacetime . The effective equation of motion can be obtained by varying W = W0 + W1 with respect to Aν as follows,

[formula]

in which only terms of first order in α and [formula] are kept. Now we use the geometrical optics approximation, in which the electromagnetic field is written as a slowly-varying amplitude and a rapidly-varying phase through a small parameter ε, i.e, [formula], where ϑ is a real scalar field. In geometric optics, the wave vector is defined as the gradient of the phase, i.e, kμ  =  ∂μϑ and the polarization vector is introduced through Aμ = Aaμ, where A is the amplitude and aμ is the polarization vector. Rewriting the equation of motion ([\ref=equation_of_motion]) as an equation for the polarization vector we have [\cite=8],

[formula]

From which the light cone condition at O(ε- 1) is given by

[formula]

in which aμaμ =  - 1. Since this effective equation of motion is homogeneous and quadratic in kμ it can be written as

[formula]

in which Gμν could be defined as an effective (physical) metric whose null geodesics represent the modified photon trajectories. In other words at this order of approximation there is no dispersion and consequently the phase and group velocities are equal and given by

[formula]

From ([\ref=eff]) it could be seen that there is a possibility for the modified null cone to lie outside the original light cone leading to superluminal photon velocities as well as modified trajectories. It is this feature of QGO that will be the main focus of our study through Fermat's principle in the forthcoming sections.

Fermat's principle in QGO

One way to look at the nature of the modified null trajectories in QGO is through the fundamental definition of null rays via Fermat's principle. Within the assumptions of geometrical optics, the trajectory of a light ray γ from a source P to an observer on his world line L, in a space-time (M,gμν), can be characterized by the following relativistic version of Fermat's principle [\cite=9]: Signal's arrival time is stationary with respect to the first order variations of γ within the set of smooth null curves from P to L . In stationary space-times Fermat's principle takes a version of particular interest. To invoke this version of the principle, we employ the 1 + 3 (threading) formulation of space-time decomposition in which the space-time metric can be written in the following form [\cite=10]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

is the spatial distance in terms of the 3-dimensional metric γij of the three dimensional space. Using the identity gμνgνσ  =  δμσ it could be shown that the following relations also hold

[formula]

Using the classical version of Fermat's principle (i.e at [formula]) [\cite=10], we obtain its QGO version for the propagation of null rays in an stationary gravitational field, taking into account the above vacuum polarization effects. Fermat's principle states

[formula]

where the integral is taken along the spatial projection of the physical rays which are to be varied with fixed endpoints. Rewriting the light cone equation ([\ref=light_cone]) in the form,

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

In which [formula] stands for the modified wave vector to the first order in α. Noting that the vector ki must have the direction of the vector dxi for the classical photon (zeroth-order of the above equation), i.e, [formula] we find its correction of [formula] by substituting the classical values for ki and k0 in the right hand side of ([\ref=null_cone]), and the conjectured modified wave vector [formula] in its left hand side so that it reduces to

[formula]

where we have used the fact that

[formula]

is the constant frequency along the ray. After a few lines of simple manipulations it is found that

[formula]

and consequently substituting for k0 from ([\ref=wave]) we end up with

[formula]

in which [formula]. It is not difficult to double check that this vector satisfies equation ([\ref=null_cone]) up to the first order in α. To obtain the expression for ki we use the following relation,

[formula]

which is a direct consequence of the relations given in ([\ref=relation]). Therefore

[formula]

Multiplying by dxi and dropping the constant factor k0 we end up with the following modified version of the Fermat principle,

[formula]

In a static background (for which [formula]) we have

[formula]

Comparison of ([\ref=Fermat]) with Fermat's principle in its classical form, i.e [formula] [\cite=9] [\cite=10], indicates that the trajectory of a light ray in a gravitational field is determined in the same way as in an inhomogeneous refractive medium with n as its effective local index of refraction given by

[formula]

in which [formula] is the tangent vector to the ray. The equations ([\ref=Fermat]), ([\ref=static]) and ([\ref=refractive_index]) reduce to their corresponding classical counterparts at zero α limit. An alternative representation is given by introducing the four vector [formula], which is null with respect to the background metric and its components are [formula]. The covariant components of the tangent vector ei form a three-dimensional vector in the space with metric γij and correspondingly the square of this vector is equal to one.

[formula]

With such a definition, the effective local index of refraction is expressed as

[formula]

This is obviously a result more general than the standard gravitational result discussed in [\cite=10] where only the effect of the gravitational field (in the context of 1 + 3 approach), as a dispersive medium, on photon propagation is considered. A comparison between the classical wave vector [formula] and Eμ shows that [formula] i.e, these two vectors are parallel . Therefore we have

[formula]

where δn and δk2 are refractive index and null cone modifications respectively. The latter has been studied for different directions and polarizations in many curved backgrounds [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. So evaluation of δn reduces to the multiplication of δk2 by the local factor [formula].

Polarization sum rules and horizon theorem

In the previous section it is shown that δn is proportional to δk2, using ([\ref=refractive_index_correction]) we can state two theorems parallel to polarization sum rules and horizon theorem in [\cite=8].

Polarization sum rules

For Ricci flat space-times, the sum over the two physical polarization of the refractive index is zero i.e, [formula], but for non Ricci flat space-times satisfying the Einstein field equations,

[formula]

Substituting for coefficients a and b ,we arrive at

[formula]

where Tμν is the energy momentum tensor. Since in the weak field perturbative expansion, we can take kμ to be null on the right hand side of equation ([\ref=sum_n1]), the null energy condition implies [formula]. So assuming the null energy condition, we always have [formula]. This relation is consistent with the polarization summed velocity shift, [formula] [\cite=8].

Horizon theorem

In [\cite=8], it is shown that for spacetimes with an event horizon, photons with momentum directed normal to the horizon have velocity equal to c, i.e. the light cone remains k2 = 0 independent of photon polarization. Using ([\ref=refractive_index_correction]) yields that such (QGO) photons also have local refractive index equal to E0, independent of their polarization.

Electromagnetic analogy

With a similar discussion, one can find the modified refractive index corresponding to the modified light cone condition in an arbitrary anisotropic but homogenous electromagnetic field in flat space-time. The description of such a photon based on the one-loop action can be given by an expansion in powers of [formula] which is a dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the background scale to a typical mass in the theory. Starting from the Euler-Heisenberg [\cite=12] effective action

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula], we derive the equation of motion Analogous to the equation ([\ref=pol]) in the gravitational case, using similar arguments the geometric optics approximation gives

[formula]

where Fμν is the background electromagnetic field strength. Rewriting the above equation as an equation for the physical polarization vector, aμaμ =  - 1, we have

[formula]

For a polarization state orthogonal to the plane spanned by the photon momentum and magnetic field direction, in which Fμνaμ = 0, the light cone condition is

[formula]

Here in the second equality with the classical energy-momentum tensor expression, [formula], the higher order corrections are neglected. For the second state coplanar with the above plane, it is given by

[formula]

where in both cases ([\ref=ref1]) and ([\ref=ref2]), the null cone dependence on the energy momentum tensor is similar to that of the gravitational case and the polarization dependence appears through the coefficient of Tμνkμkν (or what we have called Aμν in equation ([\ref=null_cone0])). Setting h and gα equal to one and zero respectively in defination of Eμ components and using equation ([\ref=refractive_index1]), the local refractive index for each polarization is given by

[formula]

Again notice that if [formula], both polarizations have refractive indices larger than one. It is also notable that the above expressions agree with the results of [\cite=Tsai] in the weak field and low frequency limit. Now taking the polarization sum and substituting for the explicit values of coefficients y and z, we find

[formula]

This should be compared with eq. ([\ref=sum_n1]) for the gravitational case. Notice that for electromagnetism, the sum over the one-loop correction is proportional to α2, essentially because the lowest order terms in the Euler-Heisenberg action are of 4th order in the background fields, i.e. [formula], compared to the 3rd order terms (i.e. [formula]) in the Drummond-Hathrell action [\cite=2].

Spatial Light Paths

The stationarity of the photon arrival time under the first order variation of γ spatially translates into the stationarity of its arbitrarily parametrized spatial arc length

[formula]

in which λ is a general parameter and [formula]. For an stationary spacetime the above variation reduces to the spatial light path equation

[formula]

in which [formula]. Now choosing λ for the extremal path to be proportional to the spatial arc length l, i.e λ  =  αl, we end up with the following equation for the light paths

[formula]

Now for the classical part of n, i.e in the absence of the quantum corrections, we have

[formula]

After some manipulation we get

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the projection of [formula] onto the plane normal to the direction of the ray given by the unit tangent vector [formula]. This equation describes how a classical light ray in a curved stationary background is deviated from a straight line in Minkowski space. Deviation is devided into two intrinsically different parts. The first term corresponds to an attraction towards the deflection center, the so called gravitoelectric force, whereas the second term is due to the gravitomagnetic force originated from the gravitomagnetic potential [formula] [\cite=lynd]. In the presence of the quantum interactions, the equation for the spatial light paths, eq.([\ref=ind]), is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and the correction term in right hand side is

[formula]

Gathering all together, we have

[formula]

in which [formula] and the derivatives are given by the following relations in the same coordinate frame

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=spatial_path]) is a complicated combination of curvature and metric components which is formulated through the stationarity of the arrival time under the variations of the null curves connecting the source to the timelike observer in the presence of quantum corrections. From the above calculations, compared to the classical path, the time delays are expected to be of order α . Therefore the natural question one should address is whether these corrections pile up as the travel distance increases. If the answer is yes, then a deviation much larger than the scale of the theory could be achieved. A more detailed discussion of this topic will be given elsewhere [\cite=11].

Discussion

It is natural to expect that the inclusion of QED vaccum polarization effect on photons propagating in a background gravitational field should modify their trajectories in that field. This is actually part of the ongoing studies under the general title of quantum gravitational optics (QGO). To look at the roots of this trajectory modification we have studied Fermat's principle in QGO in the context of threading (1 + 3) formulation of spacetime decomposition which is best adapted to the employed version of the principle. Taking the above QGO effects into account, it is shown there is an effective Fermat's principle for the propagation of a ray in a general stationary background through the introduction of an explicit expression for the effective index of refraction. Obviously not only QGO photons do not propagate along the shortest line in space but also the effective refractive index is itself a complicated combination of curvature and metric components as well as the quantum corrections considered in the context of QGO. The modification of the refractive index is shown to be proportional to the null cone modification in the presence of QGO effects i.e δk2. This fact is used to show that the polarization summed shift in the refractive indices is greater than or equal to zero. It is also shown that for photons with momentum directed normal to the horizon the refractive index being equal to the classical case is polaraization independent. Polarization dependent refractive indices for the electromagnetic analogue of the same problem are calculated explicitly and compared with their gravitational counterparts in the weak field and low frequency limit. Finally, through the effective refractive index, the equation of spatial light paths in the presence of the above quantum corrections is found.
