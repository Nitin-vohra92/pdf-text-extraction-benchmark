Integral Riemann-Roch formulae for cyclic subgroups of mapping class groups

Introduction

Let Σg be a closed oriented surface of genus g and [formula] the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of Σg equipped with the C∞-topology. The mapping class group Γg is the group of path components of [formula]. Throughout this paper we assume g  ≥  2. There are two important families of integral cohomology classes of Γg, Morita-Mumford classes ek and Chern classes ck. Newton classes sk are integral polynomials of ci's (see Section [\ref=sec-def] for the precise definitions). Over the rationals, these classes are related by the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem (or the Atiyah-Singer index theorem) which implies that

[formula]

for all k  ≥  1, where B2k is the 2k-th Bernoulli number (see [\cite=MR89e:57022] [\cite=MR85j:14046]). The first author conjectured in [\cite=nilpotency] that similar relations hold over the integers, as stated in the below.

Let N2k',D2k' be coprime integers satisfying B2k / 2k = N2k' / D2k'. Then [formula] holds for all g  ≥  2 and k  ≥  1.

The conjecture is known to be affirmative for k = 1 (i.e. [formula] for g  ≥  2), since [formula] for g  ≥  3 as was proved by Harer [\cite=harer-2nd] (see [\cite=nilpotency] for the case g = 2). Moreover, the second author showed that a slightly weaker version of the conjecture holds for hyperelliptic mapping class groups [\cite=hyperell]. The purpose of this paper is to verify the conjecture for cyclic subgroups of Γg:

Let 〈γ〉 be a cyclic subgroup of Γg generated by γ∈Γg. Then

[formula]

where e2k - 1(γ),s2k - 1(γ) are the restriction of e2k - 1,s2k - 1 to 〈γ〉.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec-def] we will recall the definitions of Morita-Mumford classes ek and Newton classes sk of Γg. In Section [\ref=sec-fpd] we will introduce the fixed point data of an element γ∈Γg of finite order, and express ek(γ) and sk(γ) in terms of the fixed point data of γ. The expression of ek(γ) was obtained in [\cite=AKU] [\cite=MR1664755]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main] will be given in Section [\ref=sec-proof]. The key ingredient for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main] is a certain generalization of Voronoi's congruence on Bernoulli numbers (Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi]), which will be proved in Section [\ref=sec-Voronoi] by using a result of Porubský [\cite=porubsky] [\cite=porubsky2].

There are some conflicting notations of Bernoulli numbers. We define B2k (k  ≥  1) by a power series expansion

[formula]

Thus B2 = 1 / 6,B4 =  - 1 / 30,B6 = 1 / 42,B8 =  - 1 / 30,B10 = 5 / 66, and so on. Our notation is consistent with [\cite=IR] but differs from [\cite=nilpotency] [\cite=hyperell] [\cite=MR89e:57022].

Definitions

In this section, we recall definitions of Morita-Mumford classes and Newton classes of Γg. Let π:E  →  B be an oriented Σg-bundle, TE / B the tangent bundle along the fiber of π, and [formula] the Euler class of TE / B. Then the k-th Morita-Mumford class [formula] of π is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the Gysin homomorphism (or the integration along the fiber). The structure group of oriented Σg-bundles is [formula]. Hence passing to the universal Σg-bundle

[formula]

we obtain the cohomology classes [formula]. Now a result of Earle and Eells [\cite=ee] implies that the classifying space [formula] is homotopy equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space BΓg = K(Γg,1) so that we obtain the k-th Morita-Mumford class [formula] of Γg.

Let U(g) be the unitary group. The k-th Newton class [formula] is the characteristic class associated to the formal sum [formula]. Note that s1 = c1 and [formula] where [formula] is the i-th Chern class and Nk is the k-th Newton polynomial. The Newton classes are also called the integral Chern character in the literature, for [formula] coincides with the Chern character.

Now the natural action of Γg on the first real homology [formula] induces a homomorphism [formula]. The homomorphism yields a continuous map

[formula]

of classifying spaces, for the maximal compact subgroup of [formula] is isomorphic to U(g). The k-th Newton class [formula] of Γg is defined to be the pull-back of [formula] by η (we use the same symbol). The k-th Chern class [formula] of Γg is defined similarly.

In [\cite=nilpotency] and [\cite=MR89e:57022], Chern classes and Newton classes of Γg were defined in terms of the action of Γg on the cohomology [formula] rather than the homology. Hence the k-th Newton class sk considered in those papers is ( - 1)k times of ours.

Any oriented Σg-bundle π:E  →  B can be regarded as a continuous family of compact Riemann surface of genus g. Let Eb be the fiber of of b∈B and H0(Eb,Ω1Eb) the space of holomorphic 1-forms on Eb. We obtain a g-dimensional complex vector bundle

[formula]

over B, which is called the Hodge bundle associated to π. The Chern classes ck(ξ) and Newton classes sk(ξ) coincide with the pull-back of Chern classes and Newton classes of Γg by the classifying map B  →  BΓg of π. Indeed, the classifying map B  →  BU(g) of ξ can be identified with the composition of B  →  BΓg and η:BΓg  →  BU(g). See [\cite=hyperell] and [\cite=MR89e:57022] for precise.

For later use, we introduce characteristic classes of unitary representations of finite groups. See [\cite=thomas] for precise. Let G be a finite group and ρ:G  →  U(n) be a unitary representation. The k-th Newton class [formula] of ρ is the pull-back of [formula] by the continuous map Bρ:BG  →  BU(n) induced by ρ. The k-th Chern class ck(ρ) of ρ is defined similarly. Newton classes of unitary representations satisfy the following properties:

If ρ1 and ρ2 are unitary representations of G, then, for each k  ≥  1,

[formula]

If ρ:G  →  U(1) is a linear character, then, for each k  ≥  1 and l  ≥  0,

[formula]

Fixed point data

Let γ∈Γg be an element of order n and 〈γ〉 the subgroup generated by γ. By a classical result of Nielsen, 〈γ〉 is realized as a group of automorphisms of a suitable compact Riemann surface M of genus g. Let h(γ) be the genus of the quotient surface M / 〈γ〉, and 〈γ〉x be the isotropy subgroup at x∈M. Set [formula] and choose a set {xi}1  ≤  i  ≤  q  ⊂  S of representatives of 〈γ〉-orbits of elements in S. Let αi be the order of the isotropy subgroup at xi and βi an integer such that γβin / αi acts on TxiM by [formula] with respect to a suitable local coordinate z at xi. The number βi is well-defined modulo αi and is prime to αi. The fixed point data of γ is the collection

[formula]

The rational numbers [formula], consider as elements in [formula], are unique up to order. According to Nielsen [\cite=nielsen] (see also [\cite=symonds]), the fixed point data is independent of various choices made, and hence is well defined for γ∈Γg. The following proposition will be used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main].

See [\cite=yagita].

As defined in the introduction, let [formula] be the restriction of [formula] to 〈γ〉. We wish to express ek(γ),sk(γ) in terms of the fixed point data of γ. Let ργ:〈γ〉  →  U(1) be the linear character defined by γ  ↦   exp (2πi / n) and [formula] the first Chern class of ργ. As is known, we have

[formula]

Then ek(γ) is expressed in terms of the fixed point data of γ, as stated below in Proposition [\ref=pro:MM-cyclic].

See [\cite=AKU] [\cite=MR1664755].

Let H0(M,Ω1M) be the space of holomorphic 1-forms of M. The natural action of 〈γ〉 on H0(M,Ω1M) yields a linear representation ω:〈γ〉  →  U(g). and the induced map Bω:B〈γ〉  →  BU(g) of classifying spaces can be identified with the composition B〈γ〉  →  BΓg  →  BU(g), where the former is the map induced by the inclusion [formula] and the latter is the map η mentioned in Section [\ref=sec-def] (see Remark [\ref=rem:holo] in Section [\ref=sec-def]). Hence [formula] coincides with the k-th Newton class sk(ω) of the representation ω. Since 〈γ〉 is cyclic, the representation ω decomposes into the sum of linear characters as [formula]. The multiplicity nj can be expressed in terms of the fixed point data, as in the proposition below. For each rational number [formula], define [formula] by

[formula]

To prove the proposition, we follow the argument of [\cite=farkas-kra] first. Let π:M  →  M / 〈γ〉 be the natural projection. For each 1  ≤  l < n with l|n, we set

[formula]

For each non-empty Xl, we set

[formula]

where yl is the cardinality of Xl (yl = 0 when [formula]). Choose a local coordinate z for each point in π- 1(Qml) such that γ- 1 is given by γ- 1:z  ↦  ηmlz, where ηml is a primitive n / l-root of unity. For each j and Qml∈π(Xl), choose the unique natural number λmlj such that

[formula]

Then (2.5.4) of [\cite=farkas-kra] asserts that n0 = h(γ) and

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j < n.

Let xi∈M be the point corresponding to βi  /  αi (1  ≤  i  ≤  q) and suppose that xi∈π- 1(Qml). Then l = n / αi, and the condition [\eqref=cond-lambda] is equivalent to the condition

[formula]

which leads to

[formula]

Substitute [\eqref=lambda2] to [\eqref=eq-FK], we have

[formula]

as desired.

Now we can express sk(γ) in terms of the fixed point data of γ, as stated below in Proposition [\ref=pro-newton].

By Proposition [\ref=pro-multi], the representation ω:〈γ〉  →  U(g) decomposes into the sum of linear characters as [formula] with n0 = h(γ). In view of Section [\ref=sec-def] (a) and (b), we see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

as desired.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main] relies on a number of arithmetic properties of Bernoulli numbers. We recall those properties first. Define integers N2k,D2k,N2k',D2k' by

[formula]

(N2k',D2k' are already introduced in the introduction). Note that D2k divides D2k'.

Let p be a prime number. Then

p divides D2k if and only if p - 1|2k,

p2 does not divide D2k for all k  ≥  1.

6 divides D2k and 4 divides D2k' for all k  ≥  1.

Statements (1) and (2) are direct consequences of [\cite=IR]. The statement (3) follows from (1) and (2).

For positive integers m,n > 0, define

[formula]

Let m,n be positive integers. Then

[formula]

The former follows from

[formula]

The latter is a direct consequence of [\cite=IR].

Let p be a prime number and b,l positive integers. Then

If l is odd then [formula].

If l is even then [formula].

The first statement is a special case of Lemma [\ref=cong-sum]. The second statement follows from Lemma [\ref=lem-divisibility] (2) and Lemma [\ref=cong-sum].

Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] stated in the below, which is a generalization of the classical Voronoi's congruence [\cite=IR], is the key ingredient for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] is postponed to the next section.

Let p be a prime number and c an integer prime to p. Then

[formula]

for all a,b  ≥  0 and k  ≥  1.

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. Since ek(γ) and sk(γ) are natural with respect to the restriction to subgroups, it suffices to prove the case when 〈γ〉 is a p-group. Let p be a prime and γ∈Γg an element of order pn having the fixed point data

[formula]

(we write pαi instead of αi). Choose an integer β*i satisfying [formula] for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, and set

[formula]

for each 1  ≤  j  ≤  pn - 1. According Proposition [\ref=pro:MM-cyclic] and Proposition [\ref=pro-newton], we have

[formula]

Hence it suffices to prove the congruence

[formula]

Since [formula] by Lemma [\ref=cong-sum] and D2k' is even by Lemma [\ref=lem-divisibility], the right hand side of [\eqref=want] satisfies

[formula]

Since [formula] by Proposition [\ref=pro-RH] [\eqref=eq:fpd1], and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=cong-sum], we see that

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

where the first equality follows from the fact βi is prime to p, while the second congruence follows from the fact D2k' is even as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=cong-sum]. Hence the right hand side of [\eqref=want] satisfies

[formula]

Now Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] implies

[formula]

Multiplying - (β*i)2k - 1 to the both sides of the last congruence, we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=pro-RH] [\eqref=eq:fpd1], the summation of [\eqref=eq:pre-sum] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  q provides a congruence

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=newton2], this is the desired congruence [\eqref=want], and hence verifying Theorem [\ref=thm-main].

A generalization of Voronoi's congruence

We prove Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] in this section. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] is based on a generalization of Voronoi's congruences due to Porubský stated below.

Given a positive integer N and an integer c prime to N, then

[formula]

for all k  ≥  1. In particular, if N is odd or [formula], then we have

[formula]

for all k  ≥  1.

Here congruences in Theorem [\ref=thm-por] are those in [formula]. Namely, for [formula], we write [formula] if r - s = m / n,(n,N) = 1, and N|m.

It was claimed in [\cite=porubsky] that the congruence [\eqref=eq-por1] holds for any rational number c prime to N. However, as was corrected in [\cite=porubsky2], the congruence is valid only when c is an integer.

If a = 0 then Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] is a direct consequence of Lemma [\ref=cong-sum]. Henceforth, we assume a > 0. We first prove Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi] for the case b = 0.

The proposition is a direct consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm-por] [\eqref=eq-por2] unless pa = 2. Suppose p = 2 and a = 1. Then we have

[formula]

because c2k - c2k - 1 is even and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem-divisibility] (2). Since D2k' is even, we have

[formula]

Now the result follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-por] [\eqref=eq-por1].

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi]. According to Proposition [\ref=pro-coprime], we have

[formula]

Hence it suffices to prove

[formula]

Now since

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

Under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi], we have

[formula]

Observe first

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=lem-summation-mod-p] and the fact that D2k is even, we see that

[formula]

provided al  ≥  a + 1 (i.e. l  ≥  2). Now [formula]. Since D2k is divisible by 6 by Lemma [\ref=lem-divisibility], we see that

[formula]

which shows that the congruence [\eqref=eq-interm] is valid for l = 1. For l = 0, recall that D2k' is divisible by 4 by Lemma [\ref=lem-divisibility] so that D2k' = 2γD2k for some positive integer γ. Hence

[formula]

as D2k is even and [formula]. Putting all these together, we obtain

[formula]

which prove the lemma.

Under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi], we have

[formula]

As in the proof of the previous lemma, we have

[formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=lem-summation-mod-p], we have [formula] if l is odd or if l is even and al  ≥  a + 1 (i.e. [formula]). Thus

[formula]

The lemma follows immediately.

Combining Lemma [\ref=lem-vanish1] and Lemma [\ref=lem-vanish2], the congruence [\eqref=eq-intermediate-cong] follows, and hence verifying Theorem [\ref=thm-voronoi].
