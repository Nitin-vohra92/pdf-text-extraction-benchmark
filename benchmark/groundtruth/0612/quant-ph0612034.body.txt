Distinguishing Arbitrary Multipartite Basis Unambiguously Using Local Operations and Classical Communication

Suppose we are given a quantum system whose state is secretely chosen from a finite set of pre-specified unit vectors. Because of the limitations of quantum mechanics, the state of the system can be identified with certainty if and only if these vectors are mutually orthogonal. Remarkably, when these vectors are nonorthogonal but linearly independent, the state of the system can also be identified unambiguously with some nonzero success probability [\cite=Che98]. Consequently, any orthogonal (or nonorthogonal) basis always can be exactly (respectively, unambiguously) discriminated when there is no restrictions on the quantum measurements one can perform.

However, the situation becomes very complicated when the given quantum system is shared by a finite number of distant parties, where each party holds a piece of the whole system and can perform local operations and classical communication (LOCC) only [\cite=PW91]. The number of states one can locally discriminate significantly decreases. Perhaps the most surprising discovery in this field is due to Bennett and collaborators in Ref. [\cite=BDF+99], where they exhibited nine [formula] orthogonal product states that are not exactly distinguishable using LOCC, thus initiated the study of the famous phenomenon "nonlocality without entanglement". Another fundamental contribution was made by Walgate et al. in Ref. [\cite=WSHV00], where it was demonstrated that any two multipartite orthogonal pure states, whether entangled or not, can always be exactly discriminated using LOCC. Since then, many interesting works on the local distinguishability of quantum states have been done and two kinds of results have been reported [\cite=BDM+99] [\cite=DMS+00] [\cite=TDL01] [\cite=GKR+01] [\cite=VSPM01] [\cite=WH02] [\cite=CL04] [\cite=HSSH03] [\cite=CHE04] [\cite=WAT05] [\cite=HMM+06] [\cite=BW06]. The first kind of results follows Ref. [\cite=BDF+99] to show that certain set of quantum states cannot be discriminated by LOCC. The second kind of results is, similar to Ref. [\cite=WSHV00], to identify sets of states that are locally distinguishable. In particular, an orthonormal basis that is unambiguously distinguishable by LOCC must be a product basis, as shown by Horodecki et al. [\cite=HSSH03]. Another very interesting result is recently obtained by Bandyopadhyay and Walgate in Ref. [\cite=BW06], where they showed that among any three linearly independent pure states, there always exists one state that can be unambiguously determined using LOCC.

In this Letter we consider the local distinguishability of a general nonorthogonal multipartite basis. Our main result is that arbitrary multipartite basis has at least N members that are unambiguously distinguishable by LOCC. This lower bound is shown to be tight by explicitly constructing a product basis which has only N members that are unambiguously distinguishable by LOCC (Theorem 2). The significance of our result is that it gives a universal tight lower bound on the number of the locally unambiguously distinguishable members in arbitrary multipartite basis and thus provides new insight into the local distinguishability of a multipartite basis. We further obtain an equivalence between locally distinguishable entangled basis (DEB) (basis having entangled states as members) and indistinguishable product basis (IPB) (basis having product states as members) (Theorem 3), and present explicit constructions of such special basis. In particular, the existence of locally indistinguishable product basis gives a stronger form of "nonlocality without entanglement". Furthermore, these results yield the following counterintuitive conclusion about the relations among orthogonality, entanglement, and local distinguishability: Orthogonal states are not always more easily locally distinguishable than nonorthogonal ones, sometimes less orthogonality and more entanglement (or vice versa) may enhance the local distinguishability of a set of quantum states. Most notably, in proving our main results, we introduce a useful notion named unextendible bases and employ it as a tool to study the local distinguishability of quantum states. As a byproduct, we obtain an interesting connection between the local unambiguous distinguishability and unextendible bases (Theorem 1).

Let us now begin to introduce the notion of unextendible bases, which is a generalization of the orthogonal unextendible product bases that was first introduced by Bennett et al. [\cite=BDM+99] and was then extensively studied in Ref. [\cite=DMS+00]. The key difference is that in Refs. [\cite=BDM+99] [\cite=DMS+00] only orthogonal product states are considered while here arbitrary states (entangled or unentangled) may be involved. Let [formula] be a multipartite quantum system with K parties. Each Hk is a dk-dimensional Hilbert space. Sometimes we use the notation [formula] for H. Let S be a subset of H. Then span(S) is the subspace spanned by the vectors in S, and [formula] represents the orthogonal complement of S.

Definition 1 (unextendible bases): Let [formula] be a collection of m linearly independent quantum states on H. S is said to be an unextendible bases (UB) if [formula] contains no product state; otherwise S is said to be extendible. Furthermore, S is said to be a genuinely unextendible bases(GUB) if it is unextendible and any proper subset of S is extendible. In particular, when S is a collection of product states, we use the notions unextendible product bases (UPB) and genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPB) instead of unextendible bases and genuinely unextendible bases, respectively.

It follows directly from the above definition that any orthogonal UPB is necessarily a GUPB. However, when nonorthogonal states are considered, there does exist UPB that is not a GUPB. See Example 2 below for an explicit instance.

A notion closely related to unextendbile bases is the completely entangled subspace introduced by Parthasarthy [\cite=PAR04]: S is a UB implies [formula] is completely entangled; conversely, S is completely entangled indicates that any basis of [formula] constitutes a UB. Such a correspondence suggests that some works that have been done for completely entangled subspaces may be useful in studying UB.

The following lemma provides a lower bound on the size of a UB.

Lemma 1: Any UB on H must have at least [formula] members.

Proof: Let S be a UB on H. Then the cardinality of S is just the dimension of span(S). For simplicity, we write directly dim(S) for the cardinality of S. Then [formula] By the definition, [formula] is a completely entangled subspace of H. We notice that it has been proven by Parthasarthy [\cite=PAR04] that the maximal dimension of a completely entangled subspace of H is dim(H) - N. Applying this result we have that [formula] That completes the proof. [formula]

It is well known that the construction of orthogonal UPB is an extremely difficult task [\cite=BDM+99] [\cite=DMS+00]. Interestingly, constructing nonorthogonal UB and UPB is very simple. We shall need the following counting lemma which is essentially due to Bennett et al. [\cite=BDM+99]:

Lemma 2: Let [formula] be a collection of product states on H. If for each 1  ≤  k  ≤  K, any subset of {|φkj〉:1  ≤  j  ≤  N} with dk members spans Hk, then S is a GUB for H.

Assisting with Lemma 2, we are now in a position to present an explicit construction of GUPB with minimal cardinality.

Example 1 (minimal UPB):   For each 1  ≤  k  ≤  K, let {|j〉:0  ≤  j  ≤  dk - 1} be an orthonormal basis for Hk. For each 1  ≤  k  ≤  K and x∈C, define [formula], where [formula] is the normalized factor. For simplicity, let |φk(  ∞  )〉  =   lim x  →    ∞|φk(x)〉 = |dk - 1〉, and let [formula]. A key property of |φk(x)〉 is that for any pairwise different elements [formula] from C+, [formula] are linearly independent and thus form a basis for Hk. This can be seen from the nonsingularity of Van der Monde matrix
