The Phase Transition of Dark Energy

The recent cosmological observations strongly support that the expansion of our universe accelerates, obtained by studying type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)[\cite=1], Cosmic microwave background (CMB)[\cite=2] and large scale structure[\cite=3]. This calls for a theoretical explanation. Now the models of an exotic component of unknown nature called "dark energy" with the negative pressure are predominant in the literatures. It accounts for [formula] of the total energy of the universe and has the state equation [formula] to generate acceleration in Einstein gravity. Proposals of the models of dark energy range from the cosmological constant to the dynamical scalar field quintessence[\cite=4] (or phantom[\cite=5], quintom[\cite=6], k-essence[\cite=7] and so on) and the unified[\cite=8] [\cite=9] or coupled[\cite=10] dark energy models have been put forward. These models show various degrees of consistency with the observational data in describing the evolution of the universe. Given the plethora of models, choosing the models of the best fit to the observational data and investigating the properties of this mysterious component is one of the most exciting problems of modern cosmology. The variation of the density of dark energy with the redshift can provide a critical clue to the nature of dark energy which have been realized in Ref.[\cite=11]. But few investigation about the evolutional trend of the density itself of dark energy is presented in the literatures. What is discussed in the most literatures involving the density of dark energy is the fractional density of dark energy.

In this paper, We perform a model-independent analysis of the evolutional trend of the fractional density and the density of dark energy. Expect that it can serve some guides to put forward the fittest model of dark energy and to explore the mysterious nature of dark energy. The analysis is based on the two following preconditions: (1) the universe is filled with the nonrelativistic matter and dark energy, (2) the two components have not interaction and they are respectively satisfied with their own conservation condition . We use the conservation condition to derive the change rate of the density and the fractional density of dark energy. The fractional density of dark energy increases as the redshift becomes low. Considering the value of the state equation of dark energy we can conclude the evolutional trend of the density of dark energy. If choosing the preferable solution that the state equation of dark energy evolves from ωde >  - 1 phase to ωde <  - 1 phase, the density of dark energy will decrease to a minimum before increasing as the redshift becomes low which can be regarded as the phase transition of dark energy from the quintessence phase to the phantom phase. The transformation point corresponds to the state equation of dark energy ωde =  - 1. Let us see in more detail how things work out.

We consider a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe, is filled with two noninteracting components only, i.e., the nonrelativistic matter and dark energy. The cosmological equations are then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where the subscripts "m", "de", "tot" and dot separately denote the matter, dark energy, the total amount and the derivative with the cosmic time. In Eq. (1) 8πG = 1 and the pressure of the matter pm = 0 have been taken into account. We can obtain the change rate of the density and the fractional density of dark energy using the three equations above. First we discuss the behavior of the fractional density of dark energy which can be written as:

[formula]

Making use of the conservation equation (2), (3), we can express the change rate of Ωde as the cosmic time, as follows:

[formula]

Using [formula] and [formula] (a0 is the present scale factor, and today's evaluated quantities will hereafter denoted by the label [formula]), the Eq. (5) can be changed into the derivative with respect to the redshift z (this transformation is more convenient for our analysis):

[formula]

The variables in the Eq. (6) are satisfied with: z >  - 1, pde < 0, ρm > 0. So it is certain to obtain Ωde' < 0, which can draw a conclusion that the fractional density of dark energy will monotonously increase as the redshift becomes low. The result is compatible with what is described in the many literatures. It has also a important implication for the theory of dark energy that the model of dark energy like the oscillating dark energy as a candidate for dark energy with no interaction will be excluded and dark energy is sure to dominate gradually the universe. The reverse is also true that we have to consider the presence of interaction or the instance of the positive pressure of dark energy to obtain the model of dark energy of the oscillating dark energy[\cite=12].

It follows that we discuss the change rate of the density of dark energy. We change the derivative with respect to time into the derivative with respect to the redshift all the same. The equation (3) can be rewritten as:

[formula]

From the equation (7) we know the sign of 1 + ωde decides wether the density of dark energy will increase or not as the redshift becomes low. According to the sign of 1 + ωde, we will divide the problems into the three instances to discuss the variety of the density of dark energy as the redshift becomes low.

The present data favor an evolving dark energy with the state equation being below - 1 around present epoch evolved from ωde >  - 1 in the past[\cite=13]. If this is true, combining the analysis above of the state equation of dark energy we can draw the conclusion that in the absence of the interaction the density of dark energy will decrease up to a minimal value corresponding to the state equation of dark energy ωde =  - 1 and whereafter it will increase again as the redshift becomes low. This can be thought as the phase transition of dark energy from the quintessence phase to the phantom phase and the transformation point lies in ωde =  - 1. The conclusion can be extended to the inverse that one can deduce the the sign of 1 + ωde from the evolutional trend of the density of dark energy. A powerful probe of dark energy is SNe Ia, which can be used as cosmological standard cndles to measure how luminosity distance dL depends on redshift in our universe. The relation between luminosity distance and comoving distance r(z) is:

[formula]

The density of dark energy can be extracted from the comoving distance, as follows:

[formula]

because the Hubble parameter depends on the density of dark energy shown in Eq. (1). In the future more observational data will be obtained. As long as we have some information about the change rate of the density of dark energy we can deduce the sign of 1 + ωde which will provide some principles to choose the appropriate model of dark energy. And if the phase transition is confirmed in the future, the state equation of dark energy is bound to evolve from ωde >  - 1 to ωde <  - 1.

In summary, in this paper we consider there are only the nonrelativistic matter and dark energy in the universe. Ignoring their interaction, the matter and dark energy satisfy their conservation condition on their own. The change rate of the density and the fractional density of dark energy are deduced from the conservation condition. The fractional density of dark energy increases as we go to the lower redshift and gradually dominates the universe which has an important implication that it is not significant to discuss the fractional density of dark energy because as long as give a model of dark energy with negative pressure in the absence of the interaction between the matter and dark energy, it is certain to obtain the gradually increasing fractional density of dark energy. We should focus on discussing the density itself of dark energy rather than the fractional density of dark energy.

Combining the prior of the state equation of dark energy being below - 1 around the present epoch evolved from ωde >  - 1 in the past, the density of dark energy will decrease to a minimum before continually increases as the redshift becomes low which can be thought as the phase transition of dark energy from the quintessence phase to the phantom phase. On the base of these conclusion there are many questions to settle, for example which mechanism lead to the phase transition of dark energy, whether the matter and dark energy exist the interaction or not and if in the presence of the interaction how the density of dark energy will change. We believe that we will make great strides in probing into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of the cosmology by settling these questions.
