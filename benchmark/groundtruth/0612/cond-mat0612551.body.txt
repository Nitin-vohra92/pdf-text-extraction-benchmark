To the concept of the elastic interaction

In the general case we have the ground state of the continuum which can always be described in terms of the elastic field. In the ground state, this field has some definite value which does not depend on the point of the elastic continuum. The different fluctuation of elastic field which mean value is zero present the ground state too. To consider the elastic field that determines this continuum, we have to describe possible deformations of the distribution of this field which become dependent on the point of this continuum. The elastic field may be characterized by various geometrical objects, i.e., a scalar if this field describes the phase transition in a condensed matter (liquid, liquid crystal, the wave function in the superconductivity ), a vector potential in electrodynamics, a second-rank tensor in the general relativity etc. The basic concept is that in any system with local broken continuous symmetry exist states in which the elastic variables describe distortions of spatial configurations of the ground state. These distortions arise if the continuous symmetry of the elastic-field distribution is broken in a local area. The first way to break the continuous symmetry is to introduce a foreign inclusion in the elastic matter. Then the long-range interaction between inclusions is determined by the symmetry of the deformation of the elastic field. This deformations are produced by the boundary conditions on the inclusions. Then interaction expressed in terms of the characteristics of this inclusion. In a system with broken continuous symmetry also can exist defects in the elastic-field distribution, i.e., the topological defects. In the general case, each topological defect has some core region, where the elastic-field distribution is strongly destroyed, and a far-field region where the elastic variable slowly changes in space. Both inclusions and topological defects are foreign to the elastic field and can not be described in terms of this field. Nevertheless they must have characteristics which influence on the ground state of the elastic continuum. This characteristics determine the value and character of the deformation. Then the amount value of various elastic deformations can be associated with the effective interaction between inclusions. In other words, the presence of the field deformation immediately leads to the interaction. Such interaction did not need the carrier. Interaction of other type determined by the changes of the global deformation of elastic field can arise only when inclusions changing or moving.

Let us consider how the deformation of the elastic-field distribution can produce interaction of additional inclusions or topological singularities. We start with the description of a scalar field with spatially uniform ground state. We have to describe probable deformations of the distribution of a scalar elastic field [formula]. With an additional inclusion being introduced in the elastic matter, we can write the action of this system in the form

[formula]

where the first term describes the deformation energy of the elastic field φ and the second term is responsible for the effect of this inclusion, located at the point [formula], on the elastic field. Note that the inclusion must possess properties which influence the elastic continuum. The first way to describe the interaction of inclusions is to obtain the change of the deformation energy produced by this additional inclusions. In the Fourier presentation [formula] we can rewrite the action in the [formula] space in the form

[formula]

In order to find probable configurations of the field φ we have to solve Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations with minimum of action with regard to the boundary conditions on the inclusion. This equation is given by

[formula]

which corresponds to the Poisson equation [formula] in the real space. The solution of this equation yields the field distribution in the form

[formula]

With this distribution of the field, we can calculate the elastic-field deformation energy produced by two inclusions:

[formula]

Having integrated over [formula] we obtain the interaction energy of two inclusions in the standard form

[formula]

If we assume that the scalar field is the electrostatic potential and f is the charge, we obtain the energy of Coulumb-like charge interaction through the deformation of the electric field. And, if we assume that the scalar field is the fundamental scalar field and [formula] is the mass, we obtain that this mass interacts through the deformation of the scalar field according to the Newton law of repulsive nature. In the two-dimensional case the interaction energy takes the form [\cite=nik]

[formula]

which is the energy of the interaction of two particles which distort the interface with the surface tension σ, where r0 is an arbitrary constant. In order to take into account the charge dispersion in the matter we have to describe the distribution of this field in the area of dispersed charges. In this case, in this the local area the symmetry of the elastic-field distribution is different and [formula], where [formula] is the distance to a single charge and, having introduced the dipole moment [formula], we find that can find the dipole-dipole interaction in standard form. The symmetry of distribution of elastic field which produce two inclusion is different as symmetry deformation elastic field every inclusion. Two-particle system selects the solution which corresponds the position and properties of these inclusions

For a system with broken continuous symmetry, we can consider a class of defects in the distribution of elastic field that are called the topological defects. A topological defect can play the role similar to a particle which changes the elastic field. In the general case, each topological defect has a core region, where the elastic-field distribution is strongly destroyed, and a far-field region where the elastic variable slowly varies in space. The boundary conditions are then determined by the conditions on the core of the defect. In this approach we can find the interaction energy of topological defects. We can start from action (1) without additional force f. The equation of minimum action in this case is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation

[formula]

This equation has many solutions. The first solution, φ = 0 or φ = const, is trivial and describes the ground state. The particular solution of this equation, compatible to the existence of a topological singularity, may be written as φn = (mrn + kr- (n + 1))Yn(θ,φ), and in the case n = 0 we have a spherically symmetric solution [formula] where k may be interpreted as the magnitude of the topological charge. This solution can describe the singularity in the topological behavior of the scalar field. As a result, this solution has infinite eigenvalue, however the interaction energy of such topological charges is finite. A superposition of two solutions for the scalar field, [formula], which produce two topological charges and determine the interaction energy given by [formula] yields

[formula]

where d is the distance between the topological charges. This formula implies that two topological defects with like signs in the elastic scalar field repel according to the Coloumb law. In a more rigorous approach [\cite=lupe] the interaction energy of two defects in the two-dimensional have the same law.

Let us find this solution for a dynamical electromagnetic field. The action for electrodynamics may be written in the standard form, i.e.,

[formula]

where the Maxwell stress tensor [formula] is determined by the vector-potential [formula] and [formula] is the current of charges. From the minimum of action, we obtain the field equations as given by

[formula]

. For the Lorentz gauge condition [formula] in the four-dimensional Euclidean space, the latter equation came to wave equation for Furier-transformed vector potential Ai(k,ω) with right term ji, whose solution can write as [formula]. If substitute this solution in the expression for the action and thus obtain the interaction energy of different currents in the standard form, i.e.,

[formula]

where [formula] is the Green function. For an example we describe the interaction of two charges which move progressively with the velocity v. In this case the charge changes by the law [formula]. With regard to the result [\cite=lan], the Fourier component of the vector potential can be written as [formula] and [formula] Having substituted this vector potential in the expression for the interaction energy we find that in the case v = 0 we have the previous result. In the other case when [formula] yields the interaction energy in the form [formula] that reproduces the standard resultant interaction of variable charges. This interaction is dynamical and arises if the charge changes its position or varies in time. The delivery of the field variation is provided by motion or changes of the global deformation.

Same result we can obtain if describe the gravitation field and the appearance the interaction of masses which produce the change of the geometry of space. The action of the gravitation field and distributed matter is given by the standard expression

[formula]

where R is the curvature, T is the compression of the energy-momentum tensor with the metric tensor gμν, Ω is the space-time volume, and G gravitational constant. Minimization of this action yields the Einstein equation

[formula]

For a distributed matter, the of energy-momentum tensor can be written as T00 =  - mc2 and the field equation reduces to [formula]. In the linear approximation we have [formula] that have as result [\cite=lan] [formula]. Thus we obtain the Poisson equation [formula]. We substitute the solution of this equation in the expression for the action and thus obtain the interaction energy of the distributed matter in the form of the standard Newton law

[formula]

This interaction energy has attractive nature by virtue of the specifics of gravitation filed which is described by the second-rank tensor.

In Refs. [\cite=inf], [\cite=inf1] the field equation in the empty space was written as

[formula]

according to Einstein's statement that the geometry cannot be mixed with matter. Solution of this equation for a continuum distribution of matter does not exist. However, there exists a solution with a singular point in the distribution of matter. In this presentation we can obtain the same equation for the gravitational field. The field equation determines the law of motion in terms of the integral of motion of the surface that surrounds this singularity. Same presentation of charge it possible make in electrodynamic where we must solve only equation for free elastic field

[formula]

. The charge in electrodynamics, as well as the energy-momentum in the general relativity, is foreign with respect to the field and cannot be described in terms of either potentials or the geometry. They can be only topological singularities in the distribution of the elastic field. Interaction of these singularities is governed by the deformation of the elastic field. In the presentation particle as topological defect is two preference. First, in this case we have the law of conservation the topological charge and this not dependent from nature of elastic field. Second, we can estimate the size of particle as the core this defect. The structure this core is structure of particle. In this picture the charge and gravitational constant play role the module of tension.

The action for free electrodynamics field can written in the standard form, i.e.,

[formula]

The variation this action is follow [\cite=lan]

[formula]

Last term go to zero because inasmuch as the surface term and potential on the surface disappear and this part throw out. But, if we have topological defect it is not correct.This surface integral is not zero in both inside surface of defect and outside surface the area where exist the electrodynamic field. Can obtain this non zero term for the defects. For xk = x0 = ct the general presentation take the form

[formula]

This term can be rewritten in the other form in spherical coordinates

[formula]

If we take in to account that the solution for defect [formula], we can present the last presentation in the form

[formula]

or

[formula]

For xk = r we can obtain the other stream of energy through the surface

[formula]

that is density of energy as in previous case which we must make for deallocation the defect from point zero to infinity. Combining both obtaining part we can write in four dimensional the additional part in the action for the electrodynamic field

[formula]

The same we cam make from gravitational field [\cite=eding]. If we start from action

[formula]

for free gravitation field we can obtain the energy-impulse tensor as variational parameter which describe peculiarity in geometry. Every action determine elastic deformation which produce the topological defect. We can estimate the size of particle as core this topological defect. This possible make in two way. The first way is similar. Every core must have the energy mc2, where m is mass of particle or core defect. In the process of arise two particles must appears two topological defect with different signs. In this case arise the energy of interaction between them. We can observe two particle only in the case when the distance between them will be larger tho sizes of core. In the condition of equality of energy [formula] we obtain that the size of core of size of particle [formula]. If f is electric charge we obtained the size of electron, as elementary particle in the form

[formula]

[formula] is constant of electric interaction and [formula] is Compton length.The size of electron is the size of core of topological defect in electrostatic field and this size is smallest as Compton length in ~  450 time. In the case gravitation field

[formula]

where [formula] is Plank mass. The elementary particle in this presentation has not structure. Return to action of distribution of elastic field. In four dimensional the action of elastic field in general case can write in the form

[formula]

where gradient is derivation on the all coordinate and take in to account the additional part influence the particle or defect on the distribution of elastic field. Let suppose that elastic field after broken continuum distribution and formation defect, which we describe as particle, fluctuated. This fluctuation we can obtain as elastic field ψ which take in to account the possible fluctuation of peculiarity of defect, which we can describe as δf. After this changing we can rewrite the action in the new form

[formula]

If assume that fluctuations of elastic field interacts with an additional random field δf which involves random vacuum fluctuations which are not described by the scalar field. Let us assume that the values of this field are distributed according to Gaussian law. The average expression for the fluctuations of the additional field is given by a continuum integral over the fluctuations, i.e.,

[formula]

where D2 is the dispersion and the last term describes the energy of fluctuations of the additional random field. Integrating over all probable configurations of the additional field δf we can obtain the the effective action in the form

[formula]

For elastic filed ψ the equation of field will be meet the new equation

[formula]

For this equation D2 must have dimension as [formula]. If take the [formula] the equation for field ψ take the form Laplace equation in four dimensional for the wave function. The additional deformation of elastic field which can not formed defect can describe by as field which can be present as wave of elastic matter. This presentation not contrary to quantum mechanic because not determination the position of defect. Formation of this defect accompany the additional deformation which have the wave nature.
