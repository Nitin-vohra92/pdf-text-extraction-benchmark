Black ring with two angular momenta

The study of gravitation in space-times of various dimensions is required by string theory. Black holes are the objects of crucial importance for gravitation. One of their characteristic features is the small number of parameters they depend on. In four dimensions, according to the no-hair theorems, the only allowed parameters are mass, angular momentum and gauge charges. The uncharged solution was found by Kerr [\cite=Kerr:1963], it has an event horizon of spherical topology. Its higher-dimensional analogue [\cite=Myers:1986] was known already for some time, when the five-dimensional black ring solution was discovered [\cite=Emparan:2001], having the event horizon topology S1  ×  S2. Then it became clear that the family of black holes has a richer structure in more space-time dimensions. Subsequently, a lot of attention was focused on black rings in 5D supergravity (see [\cite=Emparan:2006] for a review).

A body in the four-dimensional space can rotate in two mutually orthogonal planes and thus has two independent angular momentum parameters. The black ring solution presented in [\cite=Emparan:2001] has only one angular momentum, the other being equal to zero, and obviously can not be the most general one. In this article we present the general regular black ring solution of five-dimensional general relativity with two independent angular momenta. The solution is constructed using the complete integrability of this system by the inverse scattering problem method. We use Belinski-Zakharov method [\cite=Belinski:1978] [\cite=Belinski:1979] of adding solitons to a seed solution. The effectiveness of this approach for finding higher-dimensional black hole solutions was tested in [\cite=Pomeransky:2005] by rederiving the 5D Myers-Perry solution. To apply this technique to black rings it was necessary to know an appropriate seed solution. We find it by combining the results of [\cite=Mishima:2005] [\cite=Mishima:2006] [\cite=Tomizawa:2005] [\cite=Tomizawa:2006] [\cite=Figueras:2005]. We also used extensively [\cite=Harmark:2004] at all stages of our work.

The family of 2-soliton solutions, that we have found, contains not only regular black rings, but also black rings with the conical singularity and the Dirac string singularity of arbitrary magnitudes. We do not give here the expressions for these singular metrics, because they are somewhat longer than in the regular case. They will be presented in a forthcoming paper together with a more detailed derivation of the solutions. The main result of this paper is the following metric of the general regular black ring (we use a mostly minus signature):

[formula]

The metric above depends only on two of the coordinates: - 1  ≤  x  ≤  1 and -    ∞    <  y <  - 1. They are close analogues of the coordinates used in [\cite=Figueras:2005]. The metric is independent of time -    ∞   < t <  +   ∞  , and angles 0 < φ,ψ < 2π. The one-form Ω is given by

[formula]

and the functions G, H, J, F are defined as: For a regular black ring, parameters λ and ν have to satisfy the constraints 0  ≤  ν < 1 and [formula]. These constraints can be derived from the existence of the horizons (both roots of the equation

[formula]

have to be <  - 1), reality of the metric (ν  ≥  0) and positivity of the black ring mass (λ > 0, see below). One recovers the Emparan-Reall ring rotating only in the φ direction by setting ν = 0. The black ring has a regular event horizon situated at y = yh, where

[formula]

is the root of the Eq. ([\ref=horizon]) with the smallest absolute value. The event horizon volume is equal to

[formula]

The extreme rotating black ring is obtained in the limit [formula], when both roots of the Eq. ([\ref=horizon]) coincide.

Apart from (x,y) coordinates, the so called canonical coordinates ρ and z constitute another important choice [\cite=Belinski:1978] [\cite=Belinski:1979] [\cite=Harmark:2004]. They are introduced in the following way. The metric is decomposed in two square blocks: one is the 3  ×  3 matrix gab, a,b = t,φ,ψ and the other is the 2  ×  2 matrix corresponding to x,y coordinates. The function [formula] is taken as one of the new coordinates, while the choice of the other coordinate z is restricted by the condition that the 2  ×  2 part of the metric is conformally flat in (ρ,z) coordinates. One has

[formula]

It can be checked directly that the metric ([\ref=metrica]) satisfies sourceless Einstein equations (that is its Ricci tensor Rμν vanishes). The Einstein equations in our case reduce [\cite=Harmark:2004] to a 3  ×  3 matrix equation:

[formula]

and a pair of equations for the conformal factor f:

[formula]

The black ring space-time ([\ref=metrica]) is asymptotically flat, with the spacial infinity located at the point ( - 1, - 1) in the (x,y) plane. The asymptotic flatness becomes clear when the new coordinates (r1,r2) are introduced by the set of equations: ρ = r1r2, z = (r21 - r22) / 2, together with their combination r: [formula]. In the new coordinates the flat space metric has the form:

[formula]

The asymptotics of the metric components at spacial infinity has the form [\cite=Harmark:2004]:

[formula]

Comparing this with the actual asymtotics of the metric ([\ref=metrica])-([\ref=functions]) we find the black ring's mass and angular momenta:

[formula]

where GN is the Newton constant.

We derived the general black ring metric by adding two solitons to a specially chosen background. The way to find the seed metric was prompted to us by works [\cite=Mishima:2005] [\cite=Tomizawa:2005], where the black ring with conical singularity, rotating along ψ angle was found for the first time by adding two solitons to a static seed metric. This solution is complementary to the Emparan-Reall black ring, which rotates in the other plane (along φ angle). The seed solution of [\cite=Mishima:2005] [\cite=Tomizawa:2005] can be obtained by removing two solitons from the static black ring. The operation of removing solitons is described in [\cite=Pomeransky:2005], and in the present case it consists in dividing gψψ component of the metric by a certain simple function. Then, it is natural to suppose, that by removing two solitons from the Emparan-Reall black ring, one can obtain the seed metric we are looking for. Really, adding to it back a pair of solitons (with more general soliton parameters, of course) will make it rotate in the other plane too. We have found that this is indeed the case. It is worth to note that the regular black ring with two angular momenta comes from the seed solution, which is obtained from the regular Emparan-Reall ring (without conical singularity). Another fortunate fact is that to obtain the regular solution, one should set equal to zero one of the constant parameters for each soliton, which makes the calculation easier.

There remained however the following significant technical difficulty at this stage. In the inverse scattering method one needs to know the solution of a linear system of differential equations, the 3  ×  3 matrix ψ0(Λ), which corresponds to the seed metric ([\cite=Belinski:1978] [\cite=Belinski:1979], see also [\cite=Pomeransky:2005]). The black ring metric is not diagonal even if the ring rotates in a single plane only, and thus our seed is not diagonal too. It is hard to find the solution of the linear system ψ0(Λ) when the corresponding metric is not a diagonal matrix. Fortunately, this problem was solved in [\cite=Mishima:2006] [\cite=Tomizawa:2006], where the Emparan-Reall ring was reproduced by the inverse scattering method. This automatically gives us the corresponding ψ0(Λ) matrix. While originally two-soliton solutions were used in [\cite=Mishima:2006] [\cite=Tomizawa:2006], it is sufficient to consider one-soliton solutions only, which significantly simplifies the calculations.

After we have obtained the solution, an important and difficult task was to rewrite it in as simple form as possible. Initially, the Belinski-Zakharov method gives the metric in the canonical coordinates (ρ,z). Then, the metric can be cast in a considerably simpler form ([\ref=metrica]) by going over to the coordinates (x,y). We have found this transformation by comparing the metric of [\cite=Mishima:2005] in coordinates (ρ,z) [\cite=Tomizawa:2005] with its much simpler form, written in coordinates (x,y) in [\cite=Figueras:2005]. The coordinates (x,y) are related to the C-metric coordinates used in [\cite=Harmark:2004] by a Möbius linear fractional transformation with fixed points ±  1. The single remaining parameter of this transformation is then chosen in such a way, that the gψψ component of the metric has the simple form ([\ref=omega]).

After this work was completed e-print [\cite=Kudoh:2006] has appeared, where black rings with two angular momenta are studied by perturbative and numerical methods. It would be very interesting to compare the results of [\cite=Kudoh:2006] with the corresponding limits of our exact solution.
