A minimal lamination of the interior of a positive cone with quadratic curvature blowup

Introduction

In this note we use elementary methods to construct a minimal lamination of the interior of a positive cone in [formula]. More precisely, we consider the immersion

[formula]

and show that a small graph over its image is a minimal surface for s roughly proportional to δ- 1 / 4. The immersion G(s,θ) given above is a complete embedded ∞  -valued disk on one side of plane, spiraling from above with quadratic curvature blowup, and the minimal graph over G we find has boundary outside of a positive cone. If h denotes the height above the plane and |A|2 the second fundamental form of the surface, then

[formula]

We note that as δ tends to 0, a suitable renormalization of G converges to a conformal parametrization of the helicoid.

One cannot expect to find an embedded minimal graph over all of G as such an example would contradict the result of Colding-Minicozzi concerning the properness of embedded minimal disks [\cite=MMGPD] [\cite=CY]. Indeed, using a blow up argument, one observes that an embedded minimal disk contained in a half space with quadratic curvature blow up as in ([\ref=lin_blow_up]) cannot be extended beyond a positive cone with vertex at the blow up point.

Colding and Minicozzi, using the Weierstrass Representation, provide an example of a minimal disk, with boundary on ∂B1, spiraling into a plane with quartic curvature blow up [\cite=CMPVNP]. Their example gives a lamination of [formula] that does not extend as a lamination to all of B1. In [\cite=MPR], Meeks, Perez, and Ros demonstrate that such a lamination can only occur with a faster than quadratic rate of blow up. It remains to show whether or not such laminations exist for rates between quadratic and quartic. For other, more pathological examples of laminations of open regions of B1 by embedded minimal disks see [\cite=BDeanPaper] [\cite=HW3] [\cite=SidPaper] [\cite=Kl].

Aside from studying lamination theory, one of the primary motivation for recording this result is the fact that it uses entirely elementary methods which seem to be widely applicable to related problems.

The geometry of the initial immersion

In this section, we record relevant geometric information about the immersion G. These include the unit normal, metric, second fundamental form and mean curvature of G. It will convenient to use the orthonormal basis [formula] in [formula] to describe certain quantities on G where [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We note the components of the gradient and hessian of G below:

[formula]

The unit normal

The unit normal of G is

[formula]

This follows immediately as

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

The metric

Let g  =  gssds2  +  gθθdθ2  +  2gsθds  dθ be the metric of G. Then

[formula]

This follows directly from ([\ref=G_derivatives]).

As a direct consequence,

[formula]

and the components of the dual metric are

[formula]

The second fundamental form

Let A:  =  Assds2  +  Aθθdθ2  +  2Asθds  dθ be the second fundamental form, and let |A|2 be its length. Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We determine the components of the second fundamental form by using ([\ref=G_derivatives]) and [\eqref=normal]. To obtain the expression for the length of the second fundamental form, we write

[formula]

Let H be the mean curvature of G. Then

[formula]

The Laplace operator

Let Δg be the Laplace operator on G. Then

[formula]

This follows directly from the expressions for the coefficients of the dual metric and its determinant in ([\ref=determinant]) and ([\ref=dual_metric]).

Correcting the mean curvature

We seek a graph over G by a function w(s,θ) of the form

[formula]

so that [formula]. Here we have denoted by Hw the mean curvature of Gw, the normal graph over G by w:

[formula]

In order to formulate the problem conveniently, we discuss some general properties relating to the mean curvature of immersions.

Mean curvature of immersions

The mean curvature of an immersion φ(s,θ) is computed by a homogeneous degree - 1 function H  =  H(), defined on the euclidean space [formula]. We denote points of E by [formula], where

[formula]

We can then explicitly write

[formula]

H() is then homogeneous degree - 1 in the sense that

[formula]

when defined. This immediately gives that the jth derivative of H is homogeneous degree - 1  -  j in the sense that

[formula]

Let R be a rotation of R3, and let R be the point of E obtained by rotating the column vectors of [formula] by R. Then H is invariant under rotations in the sense that

[formula]

For a point [formula] in E, we set

[formula]

Note that [formula] vanishes exactly when the columns of [formula] are orthogonal and of the same length. Then, as long as [formula] is sufficiently small (say, less than 1 / 4) it holds that

[formula]

since

[formula]

and [formula] in ([\ref=mean_curvature_function]) is uniformly smooth on compact subsets of [formula]. Given an immersion φ, set

[formula]

so that the mean curvature of φ is given by

[formula]

We also note that from ([formula])

[formula]

Separating variables

Let Rθ be the rotation

[formula]

where [formula] is the dual basis in [formula] to the standard basis. Set 0:  =  e-  δθR- 1θG. For a function u(s) we abuse notation slightly and set

[formula]

By ([\ref=G_derivatives]) and [\eqref=unit_normal], both 0 and δu are independent of θ. We can then write

[formula]

Note that Qδ(u) is a fixed second order differential operator without dependence on θ since 0 and δu depend only on s. The linearization of the operator Qδ is then

[formula]

where above we have set

[formula]

For every [formula], let

[formula]

Then

L- 10 is a right sided inverse for L0.

The expression can be found by trying the ansatz L0( tanh (s)u)  =  f. Since L0( tanh (s))  =  0, this gives the reduced order equation

[formula]

Integrating then gives the expression for L- 10.

Finding an exact solution

We construct the solution u(s) to Qδ(u)  =  0 as a fixed point for the map

[formula]

As usual we do this by appealing to a fixed point theorem. For this, we need a few estimates and appropriate norms.

For [formula] we define its local Hölder function by

[formula]

Assume that

[formula]

Then for ε sufficiently small there exists C1 independent of ε such that

[formula]

Write

[formula]

where we have set (σ):  =  0  +  σδu  +  (1  -  σ)0u. By ([\ref=G_almost_conformal]) and ([\ref=u_generous_smallness_assumption]), there exists a large C independent of δ,ε such that

[formula]

Since DH is homogeneous degree - 2, [\eqref=DH_est] implies

[formula]

The final inequality follows from the uniform bounds on the derivatives of ν and the definition of [formula].

Assume that u(s),v(s) satisfy ([\ref=u_generous_smallness_assumption]). Then there exists C2 independent of ε such that

[formula]

We can write

[formula]

where we have set (σ')  =  0  +  σ'0v  +  (1  -  σ')0u. Again, the assumptions give that (σ') satisfies the estimates in ([\ref=good_nabla_bounds]), so that we get the estimate

[formula]

The function spaces in which we find the exact solution are the spaces Xk of functions on

[formula]

Embeddedness and minimality of the graph

Let wδ(s,θ) be the function given by

[formula]

By ([\ref=w_mean_curvature]), the normal graph Gwδ over G by wδ is an immersed minimal surface. Since |wδ(s,θ)|  <  eδθζδs2  <  eδθεδ1 / 2 / 4, the embeddedness of Gwδ follows from the definition of the map G in ([\ref=delta_map]).
