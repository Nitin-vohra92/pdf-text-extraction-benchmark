Covering an arithmetic progression with geometric progressions and vice versa

Lemma

Introduction

Arithmetic and geometric progressions are always an active research topic in Number Theory. In particular, problems concerning arithmetic progressions and covering, mostly over the integers, are well studied (for example, see [\cite=Sun95]). For v  ≥  0 and d  >  0, let be the arithmetic progression with first term v and common difference d. Also, for u  >  0 and q  >  1, let be the geometric progression with first term u and ratio q. Furthermore, for a positive integer n, let [formula], respectively [formula], be the set of the first n terms of the arithmetic progression [formula], respectively the geometric progression [formula]. Now, for a finite set [formula] of nonnegative real numbers, denote by [formula] the least positive integer h such that there exist h geometric progressions [formula] covering [formula], i.e., [formula]. Similarly, denote by [formula] the least positive integer h such that there exist h arithmetic progressions covering [formula]. Since given any two distinct nonnegative real numbers there is an arithmetic progression, respectively a geometric progression, containing them; it follows easily that [formula]. On the other hand, obviously, [formula] for each arithmetic progression [formula] and each geometric progression [formula]. We are interested in lower bounds for [formula] and [formula]. Our first result is the following theorem.

There exists a positive constant C1 such that for each arithmetic progression [formula] it results [formula] for n sufficiently large (how large depending only on v  /  d). In particular, we can take C1  =  1  /  π2.

Regarding a lower bound for [formula], with [formula], the situation is a little bit different. In fact, we need to distinguish according to whether q is a root of a rational number > 1 or not.

Let q  =  r1 / m with r  >  1 a rational number and m a positive integer such that [formula] is irrational for any positive integer [formula]. Then [formula] for each geometric progression [formula] and each integer n  ≥  1, with equality if n  ≥  2m.

There exists a positive constant C2 such that if q  ≠  r1 / m for all rationals r  >  1 and all positive integers m, then [formula] for each geometric progression [formula] and each integer n  ≥  1. In particular, we can take C2  =  1  /  6.

A natural question, open to us, is the evaluation of the best constants C1 and C2 in Theorem [\ref=thm:geometric_cover] and Theorem [\ref=thm:arithmetic_irrational_cover], i.e., to find where [formula] runs over all the arithmetic progressions and [formula] runs over all the geometric progressions [formula], with ratio q not a root of a rational number > 1.  The results above give 1 / π2  ≤  C1  ≤  1 / 2 and 1 / 6  ≤  C2  ≤  1 / 2.

Notation

Hereafter, [formula] denotes the set of positive integers and [formula]. The letter p is reserved for prime numbers and υp(  ·  ) denotes the p  -adic valuation over the field of rational numbers [formula].

Preliminaries

The fundamental tool for our results is the following theorem of A. Dubickas and J. Jankauskas, regarding the intersection of arithmetic and geometric progressions [\cite=DJ10].

Suppose that the ratio q  >  1 is not or the form r1 / m, with r  >  1 a rational number and [formula], then [formula] for each arithmetic progression [formula] and each [formula].

If the ratio q of the geometric progression [formula] is a root of a rational number > 1, then, without further assumptions, [formula] can take any nonnegative integer value, or even be infinite [\cite=DJ10]. However, we have the following:

Suppose that q  =  r1 / m, with r  >  1 rational and [formula] such that [formula] is irrational for any positive integer [formula]. If [formula] then v  /  d is rational and [formula] for some [formula] and some [formula]. Moreover, for each [formula] it results [formula] (mod m).

Since [formula], there exist [formula] pairwise distinct and such that uqki  =  v  +  dhi, with [formula] (i  =  1,2,3). Set t: = v  /  d and ξ: = u  /  d, so that ξqki  =  t  +  hi for each i. Then, qk1  ≠  qk3 and so that qk1,qk2,qk3 are linearly dipendent over [formula]. Being xm  -  r the minimal polynomial of q over the rationals (as it follows at once from our assumptions), we have that [formula] are linearly independent over [formula]. It follows that at least two of k1,k2,k3 lie in the same class modulo m. Without loss of generality, we can assume [formula] (mod m), so that qk1  -  k2 is rational. Now thus, on the one hand, and on the other hand [formula] for some [formula] and some [formula] such that [formula] (mod m). In conclusion, for each [formula] we have ξqk  =  t  +  h for some [formula], so [formula] and necessarily [formula] (mod m).

Finally, we need to state the following lemma about the asymptotic density of squarefree integers in an arithmetic progression [\cite=Pra58].

Let a,b be integers with b  ≥  1 and gcd (a,b) = 1. Then as x  →    ∞  .

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:geometric_cover]

Let [formula] and [formula]. For the sake of brevity, set [formula] and let [formula] be geometric progressions such that [formula]. Suppose that [formula] for [formula]. Then with the result that g  ≥  n / 6  >  n  /  π2.

Suppose now that there exists [formula] such that [formula]. For a moment, let [formula]. It follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:intersection] that q  =  r1 / m for some rational number r  >  1 and [formula]. In particular, we can assume that [formula] is irrational for any positive integer [formula]. Therefore, Lemma [\ref=lem:rational] implies that t: = v  /  d is rational, [formula] with [formula], [formula], and that for each [formula] we have [formula] (mod m). Since t  ≥  0 is rational, we can write t  =  a  /  b, where a  ≥  0 and b  ≥  1 are relatively prime integers. On the other hand, if [formula] then [formula] and uqk  =  v  +  dh for some [formula]. As a consequence, srj  =  t  +  h and bsrj  =  a  +  bh. Now we claim that there exist at most two [formula] such that bsrj is a squarefree integer. In fact, since r  >  1, there exists a prime p such that υp(r)  ≠  0. So υp(bsrj)  =  υp(bs)  +  jυp(r) is a strictly monotone function of j and can take the values 0 or 1, which is a necessary condition for bsrj to be a squarefree integer, for at most two [formula]. Consequently, if we define then [formula]. Note that the definition of [formula] depends only on v, d and n, so we can conclude that [formula] for all [formula]. In fact, on the one hand, if [formula] then it is straightforward that [formula], since [formula]. On the other hand, if [formula] then we have proved that [formula]. Now, Lemma [\ref=lem:squarefree] yields as n  →    ∞  , so that [formula] for n sufficiently large, depending only on a,b, i.e., t.

In conclusion, hence g  ≥  n  /  π2, for sufficiently large n. This completes the proof.

Proofs of Theorem [\ref=thm:arithmetic_rational_cover] and [\ref=thm:arithmetic_irrational_cover]

Let [formula] and [formula]. For the sake of brevity, set [formula] and let [formula] be arithmetic progressions such that [formula]. Suppose q  =  r1 / m, for a rational number r  >  1 and [formula] such that [formula] is irrational for all positive integers [formula]. Since r  >  1 is rational, we can write r  =  r1  /  r2, where r1 and r2 are coprime positive integers. Then, for [formula], we have so that [formula] and a  ≤  m. Suppose now n  ≥  2m. We define the sets [formula], and [formula]. Clearly, {J1,J2} is a partition of J. For i∈J, suppose that there exist [formula] such that k1  <  k2. This implies that if [formula] then for some positive integer s. Furthermore, if [formula] then for some integer h, hence

[formula]

On the one hand, if i∈J1 then we can assume [formula] (mod m), thus qk1 and qk2 are linearly dependent over [formula]. From ([\ref=equ:q_k]) it follows that also qk and qk1 are linearly dependent over [formula], i.e., [formula] (mod m). On the other hand, if i∈J2 then we can assume [formula] (mod m), thus qk1 and qk2 are linearly independent over [formula]. From ([\ref=equ:q_k]) it follows that necessarily h  =  0 and k = k1, or h  =  s and k  =  k2. To summarize, we have found that for a fixed i∈J1 it results that all the [formula] have k in the same class modulo m, while for i∈J2 we have [formula]. As a consequence, if then |J1|  ≥  |R|. Also, if [formula] and [formula], with [formula] (mod m), then [formula]. But [formula] and so [formula]. Thus, it follows that

[formula]

The set on the left hand side of ([\ref=equ:inclusion]) is an union of (m  -  |R|) pairwise disjoint sets, each of them has at least ⌊n  /  m⌋ elements, so it has at least elements. This and () yield so that |J2|  ≥  m  -  |R|. In conclusion, hence a  =  m. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:arithmetic_rational_cover].

Suppose now that q is not of the form r1 / m, with r  >  1 a rational number and [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=thm:intersection] it follows that [formula] for all i∈J. Then, for all [formula], and so a  ≥  n  /  6. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:arithmetic_irrational_cover].
