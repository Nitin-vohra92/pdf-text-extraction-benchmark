Potential of a longitudinally focusing insertion for a storage ring X-ray FEL.

Introduction

Low gain FELs with wavelength down to [formula] (6eV) have been in operation at storage rings using optical cavities(refs). Short wavelength FELs presently use linacs as drivers since they provide necessary electron beam quality. X-ray FELs such as LCLS, European XFEL or SWISS FEL are now in operation or under construction worldwide. They use linacs as drivers to assure beam qualities necessary for a SASE process at those wavelengthes. For a typical wavelength (1KeV-30KeV) the European XFEL requires emittances below 106, energy spreads ~  1MeV and peak currents ov several kA at electron beam energies up to 17.5GeV. The saturation length (for basic definitions in the FEL theory see e.g. [\cite=Saldin]) roughly defines the minimum practically sensible undulator length. At European XFEL, for the shortest wavelength, achieved with the maximum electron beam energy, the saturation length can be a hundred meters, but for soft X-rays it can be as short as 30 meters depending on the wavelength and electron beam parameters. This makes it in principle possible to fit such an undulator into a storage ring. Beam parameters in latest generation light sources such as PETRAIII (see Tab. [\ref=tab:p3]) are such that for UV photons the beam quality is not far removed from that required for an FEL. For shorter wavelength saturation length becomes larger and the possibility of using the stored beam for SASE FEL directly becomes limited. The interest in shorter wavelength storage-ring based FELs has recently been growing since they could combine extreme peak brightness and coherence of an FEL with continuous operation and lower power consumption of a storage ring (see e.g. [\cite=huang] and references therein) An insertion device with longitudinal focusing (of crab cavity type, discussed e.g. in [\cite=zholents]) would consist of a compression section, sase undulator, and a decompression section. The rest of the ring could be passed with the usual bunch length. A design sketch is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:layout]. It could be used as an insertion or as a bypass subject to space availability. In the following some simulation studies for the possibility of integrating such an insertion into PETRAIII are presented. All calculations are performed with xcode [\cite=xcode].

Possibility of an FEL insertion device at PETRAIII

Longitudinal phase space focusing

In a linac-based FEL bunch compression is a key factor, but can allow for certain beam distortion as long as it preserves the lasing bunch core. For a multiturn operation the margin for such distortions is much thinner. Space charge and Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) [\cite=csr] effects play much smaller role for longer bunches and higher energies, so cleaner compression and decompression can be in principle expected than for a typical linac FEL. The requirement is that no beam instabilities and distortions should appear on the time scale faster than the longitudinal damping time which is about 1000 turns for PETRAIII. Neglecting collective interactions, the longitudinal phase space map for the insertion is

[formula]

where the dispersive sections maps are given by matrices

[formula]

and the RF cavity maps are

[formula]

Here t and p are longitudinal coordinates usually measured in meters and relative energy units, R56 is the standard notation for dispersive time delay and V(1,2) are total RF voltages for the compressor and the decompressor. One easily checks that by choosing R(1)56  =    -  R(2)56 and V(1)  =    -  V(2) the whole transfer map reduces to unity. So when collective self-interactions and diffusion are neglected the insertion has no theoretical footprint on longitudinal beam dynamics. The beam compressor parameters which were used in calculations corresponding to PETRAIII beam parameters are shown in Tab. [\ref=tab:BC]. 800MHz cavity was chosen for demonstration since it has the wavelength longer than the electron beam size. 1.3GHz cavity of European XFEL type could also be used, but half its wavelength is shorter than the electron bunch length and the bunch tails will not be compressed fully (see Fig. [\ref=fig:compr1], [\ref=fig:compr2]). The system length with undulator is of the order of 200m. No optimization has been performed so far wrt. length, RF power, potentaial for using storage ring arcs etc., so this number could be sufficiently improved.

An obvous drawback of the system is the large amount of RF power required. Since the longitudinal focusing is proportional to V  ·  fRF higher RF frequency will result in shortening the section length. With 12GHz cavities the length can be reduced to a few meters only. However the bunch length at PETRAIII is longer than the RF wavelength for frequencies about [formula]. One can still achieve compression in that case, but it would result in a specific current shape [\ref=fig:compr2]. If low momentum compaction operation is assumed where the bunch length is shortened by a factor of say, 10, such high frequency cavities could be employed efficiently (see Tab. [\ref=tab:BC2]).

[formula]

So to increase the energy reach of a SASE FEL into the harder part of the spectrum one chooses possibly short undulator period. If using the FODO optics, decreasing the beam size is possible down to [formula] where L is the period length. E.g. 4m FODO optics will require short undulators of [formula] length with quadrupoles between them. Power estimates assuming 0.02mm and 0.068mm period undulators are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:sat1]-[\ref=fig:sat3].

Influence on beam dynamics

The feasibility question from the beam dynamics point of view reduces to the turn-to-turn preservation of beam qualities. Synchrotron radiation induces bunch diffusion, mostly in the longitudinal phase space. Such diffusion is in principle a limiting factor even for linac-based FEL performance, however for the device in question the diffusion footprint is similar to that of standard ring insertion devices and is not in principle a limiting factor. Moreover, the FEL undulators can potentially be used in place of damping wigglers for reducing the emittance. A major limiting factor in FELs is the coherent synchrotron radiation [\cite=csr]. In the design discussed the bunch length ( 1ps) is 5-6 orders of magnitude longer than the critical wavelength of the bending magnet radiation ( 2-20KeV for 0.1-1T dipoles), whereas CSR manifests itself when the bunch length is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation emitted. Estimates based on taking into account the power enhancement factor

[formula]

where N is the number of particles in the bunch, n(z) the bunch form factor and λ the radiation wavelength, show negligible effect on the total emitted power of sycnchrotron radiation. Another SASE undulator effect on the beam is microbunching which is washed away in dispersive sections and should not present a problem.

CONCLUSION AND OUTSTANDING R&D NEEDS

Following issues need to be further addressed.

Although CSR should not be a limiting factor, possibilities for other instabilities need investigation.

Another possible effect is the longitudinal phase space dilution due to nonlinearity of space rotation during compression and decompression in combinanion with diffusion or mismatching of RF phases, voltages, or R56. A calculation for 1000 iterations assuming 1% random perurbation to the one-pass map (Figure [\ref=fig:noise]) suggests that the effect should notation play a role if the compressor and decompressor pair is tuned properly.

Electron optics design has to be performed to match the existing beam transport. In this work power estimates were done based on standard FODO optics with [formula]. Due to large difference in the vertical and horizontal emittances, special optics producing round beams will improve the performance. This could be achieved by emittance exchange bewteen the vertical and the horizontal (see Fig. [\ref=fig:sat4]) plane or possibly by an assymetric low-βx optics. The energy spread after the first focusing RF cavity is significant (5%). This will require very large momentum acceptance optics in the insertion. All these questions require separate R&D.

With proper optimization of the layout for the X-ray wavelength of interest to experiments, and assuming short bunch operation (~  4ps) of a storage ring, operation of ~  100m long insertion device with longitudinal focusing as an FEL in the present or next [\cite=usr] generation of light sources producing ps photon pulses of high peak power seems theoretically possible.
