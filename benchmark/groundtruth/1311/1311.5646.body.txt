Introduction

A positive integer a is called a powerful number if p|a implies p2|a for any prime p. Amdeberhan, Medina and Moll [\cite=Amdeberhan2008] conjectured that the product [formula] is not a square for any integer n > 3. Cilleruelo [\cite=Cilleruelo2008] confirmed this conjecture. Fang [\cite=Fang2009] confirmed another similar conjecture posed by Amdeberhan, Medina and Moll [\cite=Amdeberhan2008]. Amdeberhan, Medina and Moll [\cite=Amdeberhan2008] also claimed that if n > 12 and [formula] is an odd prime, then the product [formula] is not a square. Gürel and Kisisel [\cite=Gurel2010] proved that [formula] is not a powerful number. Zudilin, in his MathSciNet review No. MR2569849, outlined a proof of the claim for any prime [formula]. Zhang and Wang [\cite=ZhangWang] proved the claim for any prime [formula]. Recently, the authors and Ren [\cite=ChenGongRen] proved that (i) For any odd prime power [formula] and any positive integer n, the product [formula] is not a powerful number; (ii) For any positive odd number [formula], there exists an integer [formula] such that for any positive integer [formula], the product [formula] is not a powerful number.

For any positive integer [formula], let

[formula]

In this paper, the following results are proved.

For any positive odd integer [formula] with at most two distinct prime factors and any positive integer n, [formula] is not a powerful number.

For any integer r  ≥  1, there exists a positive integer Tr such that, if [formula] is a positive odd integer with at most r distinct prime factors and n is an integer with n  ≥  Tr, then [formula] is not a powerful number.

General Lemmas

In this section, we present some lemmas which can be applied to any odd integer [formula].

Let P be the set of all positive primes. For a positive integer n, let

[formula]

and

[formula]

For a prime p and an integer a, [formula] means that pk|a and [formula]. For any real number x and two coprime positive integers k and [formula], let π(x) denote the number of primes not exceeding x and [formula] denote the number of primes not exceeding x and congruent to [formula] modulo k, and let

[formula]

where p denotes a prime. Let φ(k) denote Euler's totient function.

Let p be an odd prime and [formula] be two positive integers with [formula]. If

[formula]

then [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Then [formula]. By [formula], we have [formula] and [formula]. It follows from Fermat's little theorem that p|ap - 1 - 1. Let d be the order of a mod p. Then [formula] and d|p - 1 (see [\cite=Hardy]). So [formula]. Thus [formula]. So p|a2 - 1. Since [formula], it follows that p|a + 1. Thus

[formula]

a contradiction with [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

Let n and [formula] be two positive integers with [formula] such that [formula] is a powerful number. If p∈P(n), then [formula].

Since p∈P(n), it follows that p|(n + 1)! and [formula]. Noting that

[formula]

is a powerful number, we see that there exists 1  ≤  a  ≤  n such that

[formula]

Now Lemma [\ref=lem2] follows from Lemma [\ref=lem1].

Let [formula] be a positive odd number and n a positive integer with n  ≥  3. Suppose that there exist k distinct primes [formula] such that any two of [formula] have no common odd prime factors. If [formula] is a powerful number, then [formula] has at least k distinct prime factors.

Since (n + 1) / 2 < pi,pj  ≤  n + 1, we see that (pi,pj - 1) = 1 for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k. Thus any two of [formula] have no common odd prime factors. By Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Since [formula] is odd, it follows that [formula] has at least k distinct prime factors.

Let [formula] be a positive odd number with at most t distinct prime factors. Suppose that there exist t + 1 primes [formula] with [formula] such that any two of [formula] have no common odd prime factors. Then, for all integers n with pt + 1 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2p1 - 2, [formula] is not a powerful number.

For all integers n with pt + 1 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2p1 - 2, we have [formula]. If [formula] is a powerful number, then, by Lemma [\ref=lem4], [formula] has at least t + 1 distinct prime factors, a contradiction.

The following two lemmas are used to deal with small values of n.

Let [formula] be a positive odd number with at most t distinct prime factors. Suppose that there exist (t + 1) - tuples [formula] of primes with [formula] and pi + 1,t + 1 < 2pi,1(1  ≤  i  ≤  s - 1) such that, for each i, any two of [formula] have no common odd prime factors. Then, for all integers n with p1,t + 1 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2ps,1 - 2, [formula] is not a powerful number.

Given i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  s - 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem5], for all integers n with pi,t + 1 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2pi,1 - 2, [formula] is not a powerful number. Since pi + 1,t + 1 < 2pi,1(1  ≤  i  ≤  s - 1), it follows that pi + 1,t + 1 - 1  ≤  2pi,1 - 2(1  ≤  i  ≤  s - 1). Therefore, for all integers n with p1,t + 1 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2ps,1 - 2, [formula] is not a powerful number.

Let [formula] be a positive odd integer, p an odd prime and n a positive integer with [formula]. Suppose that there exists [formula] with [formula] for some 2  ≤  a  ≤  n and [formula] for all 2  ≤  b  ≤  n with [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose that c is an integer with 2  ≤  c  ≤  n such that [formula]. By Fermat's little theorem, we have p|cp - 1 - 1. Hence [formula]. That is, [formula]. By [formula] and p  ≥  3, we have [formula]. So [formula]. By the condition, we have c = a. Since [formula], it follows that [formula]. Let [formula]. By [formula], we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

it follows that [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

In order to deal with large values of n, we need the following lemmas.

(see [\cite=MontgomeryVaughan]) Let x and y be positive real numbers, and let k and [formula] be relatively prime positive integers. Then

[formula]

provided only that y > k.

(see [\cite=Dusart1999]) For x  ≥  599, we have

[formula]

(see [\cite=Dusart2002]) For x  ≥  151, we have

[formula]

(see [\cite=RamareRumely]) Let k be an integer with 1  ≤  k  ≤  72. For any x  ≥  1010 and any [formula] prime to k, we have

[formula]

For any integer n with n  ≥  2  ×  1010, we have

[formula]

By n  ≥  2  ×  1010, we have log ((n + 1) / 2) > 0.97 log (n + 1). By Lemma [\ref=Dusart1999], we have

[formula]

Again, by Lemma [\ref=Dusart1999], we have

[formula]

Let 5  ≤  r  ≤  11 and n be an integer with n  ≥  2  ×  1010. If q is a prime with q  ≥  r, then

[formula]

For q = 3, we have

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=Dusart1999] and [\ref=Dusart12002], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, by n  ≥  2  ×  1010, we have

[formula]

Now we assume that q  ≥  5.

Since n  ≥  2  ×  1010 and 5  ≤  r  ≤  11, it follows that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Case 1: n + 1  ≥  6q. By Lemma [\ref=MontgomeryVaughan], we have

[formula]

Since the function f(x) = (x - 1)( log ((n + 1) / 2) -  log x) is increasing on x∈[5,(n  +  1)  /  6], it follows from [\eqref=ab] that

[formula]

Case 2: n + 1 < 6q. Then, by [\eqref=a], we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] for n  ≥  2  ×  1010

By [\cite=ChenGongRen], we may assume that [formula] has exact two distinct prime factors. Let [formula], where q1 and q2 are two primes with q1 > q2  ≥  3, and α1 and α2 are two positive integers. In this section, we always assume that n  ≥  2  ×  1010.

Case 1: q1q2  ≤  72. By Lemma [\ref=RamareRumely], we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Thus, there exists p∈P(n) such that [formula]. Then [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem2], [formula] is not a powerful number.

Case 2: q1q2 > 72. Then q1  ≥  11 and q2  ≥  3. By Lemma [\ref=lem8], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, by n  ≥  2  ×  1010 and Lemma [\ref=P(n)], we have

[formula]

Hence, there exists p∈P(n) such that

[formula]

For this prime p, we have p∈P(n) and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem2], [formula] is not a powerful number.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] for n < 2  ×  1010

Let

[formula]

Then pi,j(1  ≤  i  ≤  7,1  ≤  j  ≤  3) are primes such that pi,1 < pi,2 < pi,3, pi + 1,3 < 2pi,1 and for each i, pi,1 - 1,pi,2 - 1,pi,3 - 1 have no common odd prime factors. Since [formula] has exact two distinct prime factors, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem6] that for all integers n with 22 = p1,3 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2p7,1 - 2 = 476, [formula] is not a powerful number.

Let

[formula]

Then pi,j(8  ≤  i  ≤  34,1  ≤  j  ≤  3) are primes such that pi,1 < pi,2 < pi,3, pi + 1,3 < 2pi,1 and for each i, (pi,1 - 1) / 2,(pi,2 - 1) / 2,(pi,3 - 1) / 2 are distinct primes. Since [formula] has exact two distinct prime factors, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem6] that for all integers n with 358 = p8,3 - 1  ≤  n  ≤  2  ×  1010  <  2p34,1 - 2 = 20000000516, [formula] is not a powerful number.

It is clear that [formula] is not a powerful number for n∈{1,2}. Finally, we consider 3  ≤  n  ≤  21. Suppose that [formula] is a powerful number.

Case 1: 16  ≤  n  ≤  21. Then 13,17∈P(n). By Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have [formula] and [formula]. So [formula] or 13α17β. By calculation, we have [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  21 with [formula]. Since [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem7] that [formula], a contradiction.

Case 2: 10  ≤  n  ≤  15. Then 11∈P(n). By Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have [formula].

If [formula], then, noting that [formula], [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  15 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula]. Since [formula] has exact two distinct prime factors, it follows that [formula]. Thus [formula]. Noting that [formula], [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  15 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula], a contradiction. Hence [formula] and [formula]. Noting that [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  15 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula]. Thus [formula]. Then [formula]. Noting that [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  15 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula], a contradiction.

Case 3: 6  ≤  n  ≤  9. Then 7∈P(n). By Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have [formula].

If [formula], then, noting that [formula], [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  9 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula]. Thus [formula]. Noting that [formula], [formula], and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  9 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula], a contradiction. Hence [formula] and [formula]. Noting that [formula], [formula], and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  9 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula]. Thus [formula]. Then [formula]. Noting that [formula] and [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  9 with [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula], a contradiction.

Case 4: 4  ≤  n  ≤  5. Then 5∈P(n). By Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have [formula]. By calculation, we have [formula], [formula], [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  5 with [formula], and [formula] for all 1  ≤  c  ≤  5 with [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem7] that [formula], a contradiction.

Case 5: n = 3. Since [formula], [formula] and [formula] is a powerful number, we see that [formula]. So [formula]. It is clear that [formula]. By [formula], [formula] and Lemma [\ref=lem7], we have [formula]. Thus [formula]. Then [formula]. Noting that [formula] and [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem7] we have [formula], a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm2], we first give several lemmas. In this section, the bounds are not best possible.

Let q be an odd prime with q  ≥  16C + 1  ≥  3. If n  ≥  4(16C + 1)2, then

[formula]

If n + 1  ≥  6q, then, by Lemma [\ref=MontgomeryVaughan], we have

[formula]

Since the function f(x) = (x - 1)( log ((n + 1) / 2) -  log x) is increasing on x∈[3,(n  +  1)  /  6], it follows from q  ≥  16C + 1 and n  ≥  4(16C + 1)2 that

[formula]

If n + 1 < 6q, then |P(n;q,1)|  ≤  π(n + 1;q,1)  ≤  6.

(Dirichlet's Theorem (see [\cite=Davenport]) We have

[formula]

.

For any odd integer k  ≥  3, there exists an integer M(k) such that, if n is an integer with n  ≥  M(k), then

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lemd] follows from Lemma [\ref=lemc] and

[formula]

It is clear that we may assume that [formula] has exact r distinct prime factors. Let [formula], where qi(1  ≤  i  ≤  r) are primes with [formula] and αi(1  ≤  i  ≤  r) are positive integers. Let

[formula]

where [formula].

If q1  ≥  D1, then, by Lemmas [\ref=lema] and [\ref=P(n)], we have

[formula]

for n  ≥  N1,r. Thus, there exists a prime p∈P(n) such that [formula] and [formula]. For this prime p, we have p∈P(n) and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem2], [formula] is not a powerful number.

Now we assume that q1 < D1. Suppose that qi < Di for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  r and qj  ≥  Dj. By Lemmas [\ref=lema] and [\ref=lemd], we have

[formula]

for n  ≥  Nj,r. Thus, there exists a prime p∈P(n;Dj - 1!!,2) such that [formula] and [formula]. By [formula], we have [formula]. Hence, for this prime p, we have p∈P(n) and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem2], [formula] is not a powerful number.

Finally, suppose that qi < Di for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. By Lemma [\ref=lemd], we have

[formula]

for n  ≥  Nr + 1,r. Thus, there exists a prime p∈P(n;Dr!!,2). Since [formula], it follows that [formula]. So [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem2], [formula] is not a powerful number.

Let [formula]. We have proved that if n  ≥  Tr, then [formula] is not a powerful number. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2].
