Maxwells Equations, The Euler index and Morse theory

Introduction

One of the most interesting problems in geometrical optics in the nineteenth century was the phenomenon of double refraction, in which a ray of light entering certain crystals is refracted into two rays. Later on, Hamilton discovered that if the ray of light enters a biaxial crystal in certain directions (known as the optical axis) then the ray of light must be refracted into a cone of rays. This phenomenon, now known as conical refraction, was confirmed a year later by Lloyd, who investigated aragonite at Hamilton's suggestion.

In mathematical terms, conical refraction is explained by the existence of conical singularities in the Fresnel surface associated to the crystal. The Fresnel surface is constructed as the set of allowed wave speeds imposed by Maxwell's equations. In this paper we will show that the singularities of the Fresnel surface can be accounted for topological considerations only. Furthermore, we apply Morse theory to establish a connection between the number of these singularities and the critical speeds of wave propagation within the crystal. Inspired by this result, we propose a program to study this problem in the general context of hyperbolic differential equations on manifolds.

Recall that Maxwell's equations in a medium with dielectric tensor [formula] are given by (see [\cite=kn:born])

[formula]

where we have assumed the speed of light to be equal to one. These equations describe the behaviour of the electric and magnetic fields E and H, in the medium under consideration. From now on we will always assume that the eigenvalues of ε are all strictly positive real numbers. If for constant vectors [formula] and [formula] we try to find planar wave solutions of the form

[formula]

we are lead to the equations

[formula]

where

[formula]

and P(ξ) is the anti-symmetric matrix such that P(ξ)v = ξ  ×  v for any [formula]. For the first of the equations [\ref=eq:PolarisationMaxwell] to hold we need that

[formula]

We can assume without loss of generality that the principal axes of ε are aligned with the x,y and z axes in [formula], so that we can write

[formula]

A simple calculation shows that if we let qε(ξ,τ) =  det (Qε(ξ,τ)) / τ2 (assuming [formula] then we have that

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula] we can visualise condition [\ref=eq:EikonalEquation] if we consider the Fresnel surface

[formula]

Physically, the Fresnel surface is the space of the allowable phase velocities. We can visualise Fε by considering the following cases:

If [formula] then

[formula]

and hence Fε is a sphere of radius ε- 1 / 21.

If exactly two if the εis are equal then Fε consists of two smooth surfaces that intersect tangentially (see Figure [\ref=fig:Uniaxial]).

If all of εis are different from each other, then Fε consists two singular surfaces (each having 4 singularities) intersecting at these singular points (see Figure [\ref=fig:Biaxial]).

The existence of singularities in case 3 accounts for the phenomena of conical refraction described by Hamilton (see [\cite=kn:born]) in which ray of light splits into a cone upon entering at certain directions of a biaxial crystal (e.g aragonite).

Maxwell Equations and Symmetric Tensors on the Sphere

In this section we will show that, for the case when the eigenvalues of the dielectric tensor are all different, the singularities of the associated Fresnel surface can be accounted purely from topological considerations.

Throughout this section we will assume F to be an orientable Riemannian real vector bundle of rank 2 over an orientable closed surface X, and we will denote the metric in F by < , > F. We will let [formula] stand for the bundle of symmetric endomorphism of F, i.e for p∈X we have that [formula] iff A is a linear map from Fp to Fp such that

[formula]

For a section of s of [formula] we can consider its eigenvalue functions [formula], i.e for p∈X we will let λs,1(p) and λs,1(p) be the two eigenvalues of s(p) for all p∈X. From now on we will assume that we have chosen λs,1 and λs,2 so that λs,1  ≤  λs,2.

Given a symmetric matrix [formula] we define [formula] by letting

[formula]

Observe that we are identifying TpS2 with the subspace of [formula] consisting of all the vectors orthogonal to p, and that the metric we are using on TpS2 is that induced from the ambient space [formula]. To simplify notation we will let

[formula]

The following result expresses the Fresnel surface Fε in terms of λε,1 and λε,2.

If Fε is the Fresnel surface associated with the dielectric tensor [formula], then we have that

[formula]

As we have seen, we must have that

[formula]

where Qε is given by [\ref=eq:SymbolEpsilon]. The above formula is the same as the formulas

[formula]

From these last two equations we obtain that

[formula]

Since ξ / ||ξ|| is a unitary vector, we have that the second term in the left hand side of the above equation is just the negative of the projection of E0 onto the orthogonal space to ξ, and hence

[formula]

The above equation means that

[formula]

where [formula] is projection onto the orthogonal complement of ξ, and I is the identity morphism of the bundle [formula]. Hence, we must have that

[formula]

where [formula] are the eigenvalue functions of σε. From this formula and the definition of Fε (see [\ref=eq:FresnelSurface]) we obtain the desired result.

Consider the case were ε is diagonal with eigenvalues ε1 = 1,ε2 = 2 and ε3 = 15, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Biaxial]. The surface at the bottom right corresponds to [formula] and the one to the left λε,2. Observe that that these surfaces join at the points ξ∈S2 where λε,1(ξ) = λε,2(ξ), and exactly at these points are where the singularities of Fε occur.

The previous example motivates the importance of the following definition.

If s is a section of [formula] we will say that p∈X is a multiple point iff λs,1(p) = λs,2(p), and we will denote the set of such points by Ms.

Let [formula] stand for traceless elements in [formula]. For a given section s of [formula] we can construct its traceless part (which is a section of [formula]) by letting

[formula]

where IF is the identity section in [formula].

The set Ms coincides with the set of zeros of the section s0. Furthermore, if s0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula] then the eigenvalue function λs,1 and λs,2 have conic singularities on Ms.

It is easy to see that for a section s of [formula] we have that

[formula]

where the norm used for an element [formula] is given by [formula]. From this it follows that λs,1(p) = λs,2(p) iff s0(p) = 0. If s0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula] then near a zero of s0 the norm function behaves like (x,y)  →  (x2 + y2)1 / 2, and hence we have conical singularities at these points.

We are now ready to prove that four singularities of Fε can be accounted from purely topological considerations. We will need the following result first.

The bundle [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], as a real vector bundle.

Since F has a metric, we can consider it as an [formula] bundle. For

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Hence, the transition functions of the bundle [formula] are the same as those of the bundle [formula].

If s is a section of [formula] such that s0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula], then the cardinality of Ms is at least [formula].

From Proposition [\ref=prop:MasZeros] we have that the Ms = Z0, where Z0 is the set of zeros of s0. We have that

[formula]

where is0(p) is the index of s0 at p. From the transversality assumption we have that [formula], and from Lemma [\ref=lem:S0FtoFF] we have that [formula]. We conclude that

[formula]

where |Z0| is the cardinality of Z0.

If X has genus g and [formula] is such that s0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula] then cardinality of Ms is at least 4 - 4g.

Apply the above proposition and the formula

[formula]

We know that the singularities of Fε occur at the multiplicity set Mε of the section sε. And the from the above Corollary we know that the cardinality of Mε must be greater or equal than 4. This is accordance with the known fact that Fε has exactly four singularities, but our argument has been purely topological. In this discussion we have implicitly assumed that (sε)0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula]. We can explicitly find the points in Mε and verify that this is actually the case.

If the the eigenvalues of [formula] are all different from each other, then the traceless part of sε is transversal to the zero section of [formula].

We can assume that ε is diagonal with diagonal elements 0 < ε1  <  ε2  <  ε3. The zero set of (sε)0 does not contain neither (0,0,1) nor (0,0, - 1). We can use polar coordinates

[formula]

and let

[formula]

The triple (p,u,v) forms and orthonormal frame, so that locally we can write

[formula]

If we identify [formula] with [formula] by letting

[formula]

then we can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

From this formula it is easy to see that the zeros of (sε)0 occur at the points (0,φm),(0,φm  +  π / 2),(π,φm) and (0,φm  +  π / 2), where

[formula]

A simple calculations shows that

[formula]

and hence (sε)0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula] at that point. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the same condition holds at the other points.

Desingularising the Fresnel Surface and Morse Theory

We are interested in finding the critical points of the functions λε,1 and λε,2 described in the previous section. One reason why this problem is interesting is that the maximum and minimum are critical points of these functions, and they correspond to directions of maximal and minimal wave velocities. We want use a topological argument to find lower bounds to the number and types of critical points. To do this, we can apply Morse theory. Recall that if [formula] is a smooth function and p∈X is a critical point of f (i.e df(p) = 0) then we can define its hessian d2f(p), which is symmetric bilinear form in TpX. A critical point p∈X of f is said to be non-degenerate iff d2f(p) is non-degenerate, and in this case we define the index of p as the dimension of the maximal subspace of TpX at which d2f(p) is negative definite. Morse inequalities assert that if f has only non-degenerate critical points the we have that (see [\cite=kn:morse])

[formula]

where Ci(f) are the number of critical points of f of index i, and [formula] is the cohomology group of X with real coefficients. This formulas allow us to estimate the number of critical points of a given index in terms of topological invariants of X.

We have seen in the previous section both λε,1 and λε,2 are non-smooth at Mε, so we cannot apply Morse Theory directly to them. To solve this problem we desingularise these functions as follows. For a section [formula] we define

[formula]

where [formula] is the proyectivisation of F. We will refer to Es as the space of eigenlines of s. Over this space we can define the eigenvalue function of s by

[formula]

It turns out that if s0 is transversal to the zero section of [formula] then we have that Es is a smooth submanifold of [formula], and λs is a smooth function (see [\cite=kn:mocs]). Furthermore, the space Es is topologically equivalent to the space obtained by the following procedure (see [\cite=kn:mocs])

Let X0 be obtained by removing small open disks, centred at the points of Ms, from X.

The space Es is homeomorphic the the space obtained by joining two disjoint copies of X0 along cylinders of the form S1  ×  ( - δ,δ) (see Figure [\ref=fig:Space_of_Eigenlines]).

If we restrict the projection map [formula] to Es we obtain a projection map πs:Es  →  X with the following properties (see [\cite=kn:mocs])

We have that π- 1s(X - Ms) consists of two connected component X1 and X2 such that πs:Xi  →  X - Ms is a diffeomorphism and [formula].

For any p∈Ms we have that π- 1s(p) is diffeomorphic to a circle and λs can have 0,1 or 2 critical points at π- 1(p). Furthermore, if any of these critical points is non-degenerate it must have index equal to one.

To simplify notation we define

[formula]

As an application of the above results, we have the following.

If [formula] has eigenvalues 0 < ε1  <  ε2  <  ε3 then then space Eε is a smooth surface of genus 3 and [formula] is a smooth function having no critical points at π- 1ε(Mε).

The spaces Eε is obtained joining two disjoint copies of [formula] along cylinders of the form S1  ×  ( - δ,δ), where the Dis are small open disks centred at the four points in Mε (see Figure [\ref=fig:Space_of_Eigenlines]). From this it follows that Eε is a surface of genus 3. To check that λε has no singularities in π- 1ε(Mσ) we write a explicit formula for λε and check that this is actually the case for 0 < ε1  <  ε2  <  ε3. Consider polar coordinates on S2  -  {(0,0,1),(0,0, - 1) given by

[formula]

and the orthonormal frame {u(θ,φ),v(θ,φ)} in T(S2  -  {(0,0,1),(0,0, - 1)) given by

[formula]

If we let α be the angle of a line [formula] with respect to u(θ,φ) then we can use (θ,φ,α) as coordinates for [formula]. In these coordinates we have that (see [\cite=kn:mocs]

[formula]

where

[formula]

From this, we obtain that

[formula]

where (0,φm) corresponds to one of the zeros of (sε)0 as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:s_epsilon_0_transversal] (by symmetry the other zeros of (sε)0 are dealt in the same way). The critical points of λε correspond to the αs at which [formula]. By using the above formulas we have that this equality can not hold if all the εis are different from each other.

If [formula] has eigenvalues 0 < ε1  <  ε2  <  ε3 then we have that [formula] for i = 0,1,2.

By the previous proposition we have that λε has no critical points on π- 1ε(Mε). But we know that on each of the two connected components of Eε  -  π- 1ε(Mε) the function λε coincides (up to diffeomorphism) with λε,1or λε,2.

Applying Morse inequalities to λε and using the above results we obtain that

[formula]

The above holds under the assumption that λε is a Morse function, but it can easily be seen that is the case if the eigenvalues of ε are all different from each other.

Generalisations - Future Work

In this section we propose a program to generalise our results to general hyperbolic differential operators on bundles.

Let E and F be vector bundles of rank m and k over a Riemannian manifold X of dimension n. Consider a linear differential operator of degree [formula] of the form

[formula]

where Li:C∞(E)  →  C∞(F) is a differential operator of order i. Observe that L acts on time dependent sections of E. We are interested in high frequency solutions of the equation Lu = 0, i.e in solutions to the asymptotic partial differential equation

[formula]

where u0 is a section of E and φ is a smooth real valued function in [formula] (known in the physics literature as the phase function). The above asymptotic equation leads to the the equation (see [\cite=kn:guillemin])

[formula]

where [formula] is the principal symbol of Li. If we choose local coordinates for X and local trivialisation of E and F over an open set U  ⊂  X, we can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

and for every α and i we have that Ai,α is a function from U to the k  ×  m matrices with coefficients in [formula]. The local expression for σi is then given by

[formula]

We see that over the fibre variables of T*X the symbol σi is an homogenous polynomial of degree i whose coefficients are real k  ×  m matrices.

We define the Fresnel hypersurface associated to L by

[formula]

We will assume that the following conditions hold

We have that F is a Riemannian real vector bundle and E = F . For example, if we were modelling small oscillations of an elastic surface X then we could assume that E = F = TX.

For all [formula] and 1  ≤  i  ≤  d we have that σi(x,ξ) is a symmetric operator with respect to a metric in F, i.e

[formula]

It turns out that two conditions above hold in many cases of physical interest, and in particular those physical problems that arise from variational principles. Under the above assumptions we can write

[formula]

where S(T*X) are the unit vectors in T*X and

[formula]

A polynomial p = p(τ) is said to be hyperbolic if it has as many real roots as its degree (counting multiplicities) and it is said to be strictly hyperbolic if all these roots are different from each other.

For a fixed (x,ξ)∈S(T*X) let

[formula]

The operator L is said to be hyperbolic if pL,x,ξ is hyperbolic for all [formula] in T*X.

If L is hyperbolic we have functions [formula] for [formula] given as as the roots of pL,x,ξ, and we can write

[formula]

We define ML as the set of points in S(T*X) at which two of more or the λis coincide. The singularities of FL occur at points on the set ML. Inspired by our work on Maxwells equations, we pose the following problems.

Find topological obstructions to the condition [formula]. This will provide obstructions to the existence of strictly hyperbolic differential operators on F. It is expected that the characteristic classes of F should be involved in the answer to this problem.

Desingularisation of FL. As in the case of Maxwells equation, we would like to find a smooth space EL and a smooth function [formula] that contains all the information of the λL,is. We would then expect to be able to apply Morse theory to λL to obtain similar results as in the case of Maxwells equations.

In relation with Problem 1 above we mention the work in the articles [\cite=kn:braam] [\cite=kn:hormander] [\cite=kn:john] [\cite=kn:khesin] [\cite=kn:lax] [\cite=kn:nuij], which contain some local and global results related to the multiplicity of eigenvalues of symbols of differential and pseudo-differential operators. Regarding Problem 2, we mention that the non-smoothness of λL,is at ML explain phenomena like wave transformation (see [\cite=kn:arnold]) in which longitudinal waves transforms into transversal ones (or viceversa).
