strong openness conjecture for plurisubharmonic functions

Introduction

Let X be a complex manifold with dimension n, and φ be a plurisubharmonic function on X. Let I(φ) be the multiplier ideal sheaf associated to the plurisubharmonic function φ on X. Denote by

[formula]

In [\cite=berndtsson13], Berndtsson gave a proof of the openness conjecture of Demailly and Kollár in [\cite=D-K01]:

Openness conjecture: Assume that I(φ) = OX. Then

[formula]

For the dimension two case it was proved by Favre and Jonsson in [\cite=FM05j] (see also [\cite=FM05v]). For arbitrary dimension it has been reduced to a purely algebraic statement in [\cite=JM13].

The strong openness conjecture is stated as follows, which is an open question posed by Demailly in [\cite=demailly-note2000], [\cite=demailly2010] (see also [\cite=D-P03], [\cite=LiPhD], [\cite=JM12], [\cite=Gue12], [\cite=Cao12], [\cite=JM13], [\cite=Li2013], [\cite=Mat2013], etc. ):

Strong openness conjecture: For any plurisubharmonic function φ on X, we have

[formula]

The strong openness conjecture implies the openness conjecture.

In the present paper, we prove the strong openness conjecture by the following theorem:

(solution of the strong openness conjecture) Let φ be a negative plurisubharmonic function on the unit polydisc [formula], which satisfies

[formula]

where F is a holomorphic function on Δn and λn is the Lebesgue on [formula]. Then there exist r > 0 and p > 1, such that

[formula]

where r < 1.

For n  ≤  2, the above theorem was proved in [\cite=JM12] by studying the asymptotic jumping numbers for graded sequences of ideals.

There are some immediate corollaries of the strong openness conjecture, we omit them here. Some further results are being in preparation (see our another paper), including a conjecture of Demailly and Kollár in [\cite=D-K01] about the growth of the measure of the sublevel set of psh functions related to the complex singularity exponents.

Some results used in the proof of the theorem

In this section, we will show some preliminary results used in the proof of the main theorem.

A property of L1 integrable function

[formula]

Let G be a positive Lebesgue measurable and integrable function on a domain [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

Consider the function

[formula]

t∈(0,λn(Ω)].

We first discuss the finiteness of FG(t):

If for some t0, FG(t0) =  +   ∞  , then λn(G  ≥  Aj)  ≥  t0, where Aj is a number sequence tending to +    ∞   when j  →    +    ∞  . Since G is L1 integrable, we have

[formula]

Letting Aj  →    +    ∞  , we thus obtain a contradiction. Therefore FG(t) <  +   ∞   for any t.

Secondly, we discuss the decreasing property of FG(t):

Note that {A|λn(G  ≥  A)  ≥  t1}  ⊃  {A|λn(G  ≥  A)  ≥  t2}, where t1  ≤  t2. Then we have FG(t1)  ≥  FG(t2), when t1  ≤  t2.

The first lemma is about the sublevel set of FG:

We have

[formula]

for any a > 0, where [formula] is the Lebesgue measure on [formula]. Moreover, we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and

[formula]

we only need to prove

[formula]

for any a > 0.

Note that

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

where t > 0.

If "  ⊇  " in the above relation is strictly "  ⊃  ", then there exists t0 such that

1). sup {a1|λn({G  ≥  a1})  ≥  t0}  ≥  a;

2). t0  >  λn({G  ≥  a}).

Let

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Then we have λn({G  ≥  a0})  ≥  t0.

As t0  >  λn({G  ≥  a}), we have

[formula]

which is a contradiction to

[formula]

Then the following holds:

[formula]

where t > 0.

According to the definition of FG and equality [\ref=equ:0807a], it follows that

[formula]

where t > 0.

Note that

[formula]

for t > 0. We have thus proved the present lemma.

Denote by

[formula]

where y∈(0,e- 1). It is clear that s is strictly decreasing on (0,e- 1).

We define a function u by

[formula]

where u∈C∞((e, +   ∞  )). It is clear that u is strictly increasing on (e, +   ∞  ),

The second lemma is about the measure of the level set of G:

For A > e, we have

[formula]

where λn is the Lebesgue measure of [formula]. Especially, [formula].

According to the definition of Lebesgue integration and Lemma [\ref=l:level], it follows that

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

which implies that there exists tj  →  0 when j  →    +    ∞  , such that

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=l:level], we have

[formula]

We now want to prove that u(FG(tj)) = o(t- 1j) by contradiction: if not, there exists ε0 > 0, such that u(FG(tj))  ≤  ε0t- 1j. However,

[formula]

According to the strictly increasing property of u, it follows that [formula], which is contradict to equality [\ref=equ:lim_F_G] because [formula]. Now we obtain u(FG(tj)) = o(t- 1j).

Then we have

[formula]

Note that if FG(tj) is bounded above, when tj tends to 0, then G has a positive upper bound. Therefore μ({G > A}) = 0 for A large enough.

Then we have proved

[formula]

As [formula] is strictly decreasing on (0,e- 1), then for any A > e, there exists tA such that

1). [formula];

2). tA goes to zero, when A goes to +    ∞  .

As

[formula]

then we obtain

[formula]

by the above property 2) of tA.

The present lemma is thus proved.

Estimation of integration of holomorphic functions on singular Riemann surfaces

Let [formula] be a holomorphic function on the disc Δr in [formula]. Let fa be a holomorphic function on Δr, which satisfies fa|o = 0 and fa(b) = 1 for any bk = a(k is a positive integer), then we have

[formula]

where a∈Δr whose norm is small enough, C1 is a positive constant independent of a and fa.

As [formula], we may write h = zih1 near o, where h1|o  ≠  0. Then there exists r' < r, such that |h1||Δr'  ≥  C0 > 0. Therefore it suffices to consider the case that h = zi on Δr'.

By Taylor expansion at o, we have

[formula]

As f(b) = 1, then

[formula]

where bkl = a, and [formula] when 0 < j < k.

It is clear that

[formula]

Using Schwartz Lemma, we have

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

and [formula] has a uniformly upper bound independent of a when [formula]. The Lemma thus follows.

Let's recall the local parametrization theorem:

(see [\cite=demailly-book]) Let [formula] be a prime ideal of On and let [formula] be an analytic curve at o. Then the ring [formula] is a finite integral extension of Od; let q be the degree of the extension. There exists a local coordinates

[formula]

such that if Δ'r' and Δ''r'' are polydisks of sufficient small radii r' and r'' and if [formula] with C large, the projective map [formula] is a ramified covering with q sheets, whose ramification locus is contained in S = {o'}  ⊂  Δ'r'. This means that

a), the open set [formula] is a smooth 1 - dimensional manifold, dense in [formula];

b), [formula] is an unramified covering;

c), the fibre π' - 1(z') have exactly q elements if [formula] and at most q if z'∈S.

Moreover, C'S is a connected covering of [formula], and [formula] is contained in a cone [formula].

Let Δ' and Δ'' be unit disk with coordinates (z1) and unit polydisc with coordinates [formula] respectively.

Let

[formula]

be the projective map which is given by

[formula]

We have the following Remark of Theorem [\ref=t:para].

Let [formula] be a prime ideal of On and let [formula] be an analytic curve at o. Then the ring [formula] is a finite integral extension of Od; let q be the degree of the extension, there exists a biholomorphic map j from a neighborhood of [formula] to a neighborhood Uo of o, such that the projective map [formula] is a ramified covering with q sheets, whose ramification locus is contained in S = {o'}  ⊂  Δ' where

[formula]

This means that

a), the open set [formula] is a smooth 1 - dimensional manifold, dense in [formula];

b), [formula] is an unramified covering;

c), the fibre π- 1(z') has exactly q elements if [formula] and at most q if z'∈S.

Moreover, CS is a connected covering of [formula], and [formula] is contained in a cone [formula].

Using Lemma [\ref=l:open_b] and Remark [\ref=r:para], we obtain the following singular version of Lemma [\ref=l:open_b]:

Let h be a holomorphic function on an analytic curve C as in Remark [\ref=r:para]. Let fa be a holomorphic function on C, which satisfies f(o) = 0 and [formula], then we have

[formula]

when a∈Δ' and |a| is small enough, where C2 is a positive constant independent of a and fa.

As (C,o) is irreducible and locally irreducible, then there is a normalization jnor:(Δ,0)  →  (C,o), denoted by

[formula]

where t is the coordinate of Δ. As πC is a covering, then [formula].

Without loss of generality, we may assume g1(t) = ti1 on Δr0 for small enough r0∈(0,1).

There is a given r > 0, which is small enough, such that

[formula]

where i1  ≥  1, and gi (i  ≥  2) are holomorphic functions on Δr satisfying [formula].

For given r' < r small enough, we have

[formula]

for any a satisfying [formula].

As

[formula]

and

[formula]

then we have

[formula]

for any bi1 = a.

Using Lemma [\ref=l:open_b], we have

[formula]

where C1 is independent of a and fa.

Combining with inequality [\ref=equ:0808b], we thus obtain the present lemma.

As [formula] is contained in a cone [formula], using the submean value property of plurisubharmonic function, we obtain the following lemma:

For any holomorphic function F, which is a holomorphic on a Δ'  ×  Δ'', we obtain an approximation of the L2 norm of F:

[formula]

where C3 is a positive constant independent of F. Here all symbols CS, Δ' and π are the same as in Remark [\ref=r:para].

Using the Fubini Theorem,

[formula]

and the submean value inequality of plurisubharmonic function, we have

[formula]

for [formula].

If [formula], then [formula].

As

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

where q is the degree of the covering map π|CS.

L2 extension theorem with negligible weight

[formula]

We state optimal constant version of the Ohsawa's L2 extension theorem with negligible weight ([\cite=ohsawa3]) as follows:

[\cite=guan-zhou12] Let X be a Stein manifold of dimension n. Let φ  +  ψ and ψ be plurisubharmonic functions on X. Assume that w is a holomorphic function on X such that [formula] and dw does not vanish identically on any branch of w- 1(0). Put H = w- 1(0) and H0  =  {x∈H:dw(x)  ≠  0}. Then there exists a uniform constant [formula] independent of X, φ, ψ and w such that, for any holomorphic (n - 1)-form f on H0 satisfying

[formula]

where [formula] for [formula], there exists a holomorphic n-form F on X satisfying [formula] on H0 with [formula] and

[formula]

where [formula] is the inclusion map.

Curve selection lemma and Noetherian property of coherent sheaves

[formula]

We give the existence of some kind of germs of analytic curves, which will be used.

Let (Y,o) be a germ of irreducible analytic subvariety in [formula], and (A,o) be a germ of analytic subvariety of (Y,o), such that dim A < dimY. Then there exists a germ of holomorphic curve (γ,o), such that γ  ⊂  Y, and [formula].

Note that (Y,o) is locally Stein. Then using Cartan's Theorem A, we obtain the lemma.

Now we recall the curve selection lemma stated as follows:

(see [\cite=demailly2010]) Let f, [formula] be germs of holomorphic functions vanishing at 0. Then we have |f|  ≤  C|g| for some constant C if and only if for every germ of analytic curve γ through 0 there exists a constant Cγ such that [formula].

In order to obtain some uniform properties of γ, we need to consider the following Lemma which was contained in the proof of Lemma [\ref=l:curve] in [\cite=demailly2010].

(see [\cite=demailly2010]) Let f, [formula] be germs of holomorphic functions vanishing at o. Assume that for any given neighborhood of o, |f|  ≤  C|g| doesn't hold for any constant C, where g = (g1,...,gs). Then there exists a germ of analytic curve γ through o satisfying [formula], such that [formula] is holomorphic on [formula] with

[formula]

for any [formula], where [formula] is the holomorphic extension of [formula] from [formula] to γ.

There exists Δnr, such that [formula]. We define a germ of analytic set [formula] by

[formula]

Let p be a projection

[formula]

such that

[formula]

Then [formula] is biholomorphic to [formula], which is irreducible. As every analytic variety has an irreducible decomposition, then Y contains an irreducible component Yf which contains [formula].

Since Yf is closed, then

[formula]

By assumption, for any given neighborhood of o, |f|  ≤  C|g| doesn't hold for any constant C, then there exist a sequence of positive numbers Cν which goes to +    ∞   as ν  →    ∞  , and a sequence of points {zν} in Δnr which is convergent to o as ν  →    ∞  , such that |f(zν)| > Cν|g(zν)|.

Then [formula] converges to o as ν tends to +    ∞  , with f(zν)  ≠  0.

As [formula], then Yf contains o.

It follows from Lemma [\ref=l:curve_exist] that there exists a germ of analytic curve (γ,o)  ⊂  Yf through o satisfying [formula], such that [formula] is holomorphic on [formula] for each [formula].

By the Riemann removable singularity theorem, it follows that [formula] can be extended to γ, and

[formula]

for any [formula].

Let [formula] be germs of holomorphic functions vanishing at o, and f(o)  ≠  0. Then there exists a germ of analytic curve γ through o satisfying [formula], such that [formula] is holomorphic on γ with [formula] for any [formula].

Let's recall a strong Noetherian property of coherent sheaves as follows:

(see [\cite=demailly-book]) Let [formula] be a coherent analytic sheaf on a complex manifold M, and let [formula] be an increasing sequence of coherent subsheaves of [formula]. Then the sequence [formula] is stationary on every compact subset of M.

By Lemma [\ref=l:strong_noeth], it is clear that [formula] is a coherent subsheaf of I(φ); actually for any open V1  ⊂    ⊂  M, there exists ε1 > 0, such that [formula]

By Remark [\ref=r:station], we derive the following proposition about the generators of the coherent sheaf I+(φ):

Assume that F∈On is a holomorphic function on a neighborhood V0 of o, which is not a germ of I+(φ)o. Let [formula] be germs of holomorphic functions on a neighborhood V1  ⊂    ⊂  V0 of o, such that [formula] generate I+(φ)|V1. Then there exists a germ of analytic curve γ on V0 through o satisfying [formula], such that [formula] is holomorphic on γ for any i, and

[formula]

where [formula] is the holomorphic extension of [formula] from [formula] to γ. Moveover, for any germ g of I((1 + ε)φ)0, [formula] is holomorphic on [formula], and

[formula]

where [formula] is the holomorphic extension of [formula] from [formula] to γ.

By Remark [\ref=r:station], there exists ε1 > 0, such that [formula]. As F is not a germ of I+(φ)o  =  I((1 + ε1)φ)o, then for any neighborhood of o, [formula] doesn't hold for any constant C.

By Lemma [\ref=p:curve] and Remark [\ref=r:curve927], there exists a germ of analytic curve γ on V0 through o satisfying [formula], such that [formula] is holomorphic on γ for any i, and

[formula]

where [formula] is the holomorphic extension of [formula] from [formula] to γ.

Proof Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open]

We will prove Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] by the methods of induction and contradiction, and by using dynamically L2 extension theorem with negligible weight.

Step 1: Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for dimension 1 case

[formula]

We first consider Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for dimension 1 case, which is elementary but revealing.

We choose r0 small enough, such that [formula].

As [formula], by Lemma [\ref=l:open_a], we have

[formula]

It is clear that, for any given B > 0, there exist A > B and zA∈Δu(A)- 1 / 2, such that e-  φ(zA)|F(zA)|2  ≤  A. We assume that A > 10.

Let [formula], then log |z' - zA| + ψ < 0.

Using Theorem [\ref=t:guan-zhou12] on Δ, we obtain a holomorphic function FA on Δ for each A and pA > 1, such that FA|zA = F(zA), and

[formula]

By the negativeness of φ, it follows that

[formula]

Assume Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for n = 1 is not true. Therefore

[formula]

for any r > 0 and p > 1.

Since [formula], then it follows from inequality [\ref=equ:0927a] that there exists a holomorphic function hA on Δr0, such that

1). FA|Δr0 = F|Δr0hA;

2). hA(o) = 0;

3). hA(zA) = 1.

By Lemma [\ref=l:open_b], it follows that

[formula]

where C1 is independent of A.

It contradicts to

[formula]

We have thus proved Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for n = 1.

Step 2: Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for n = k

[formula]

Assume Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for n = k is not true. Therefore,

[formula]

for some r > 0, and

[formula]

for any r > 0 and any p > 1.

Then the germ of the holomorphic function F is in I(φ)o, but is not in I+(φ)o.

Using Proposition [\ref=r:curve], we have a germ of an analytic curve γ through o satisfying {F|γ = 0}  ⊆  {o}, such that for any germ of the holomorphic function g in I+(φ), and we also have a holomorphic function hg on γ satisfying

[formula]

such that

[formula]

Then we can choose a biholomorphic map [formula] from a neighborhood of [formula] to a neighborhood Vo  ⊂  Δk of o, which is small enough, with origin keeping [formula], such that

1), [formula] is a closed analytic curve in the neighborhood of [formula];

2), [formula] satisfies the parametrization property as the analytic curve C in Remark [\ref=r:para].

Note that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

for any r > 0 and any p > 1, is equivalent to

[formula]

for any r > 0 and any p > 1.

As [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=l:open_a] that

[formula]

for any j, where π is the projection in Remark [\ref=r:para].

It is clear that for any given B > 0, there exists A > B, such that

[formula]

cannot contain Δu(A)- 1 / 2.

Then for any given B > 0, there exist A > B and zA∈Δu(A)- 1 / 2, such that

[formula]

We assume that A > e10.

Using dynamically L2 extension theorem with negligible weight

[formula]

As the conjecture for n = k - 1 holds, there exists a positive number pA > 1, such that

[formula]

Let [formula], then log |z' - zA| + ψ < 0. Using Theorem [\ref=t:guan-zhou12] on Δ'  ×  Δ'', we obtain a holomorphic function FA on Δ'  ×  Δ'' for each A, such that [formula], and

[formula]

It follows form equality [\ref=equ:infact] that there exists a holomorphic function on γ, denoted by hA, such that

[formula]

therefore,

[formula]

where hA(0) = 0, [formula].

It follows from the negativeness of φ that

[formula]

Using equality [\ref=equ:infact1], the condition [formula], and Lemma [\ref=l:open_sing], we have

[formula]

where C1 > 0 is independent of A and FA. In our use of Lemma [\ref=l:open_sing], the function hA corresponds to fa (where a = zA) in Lemma [\ref=l:open_sing], which does not correspond to h in the Lemma (actually F|γ corresponds to h).

Using Lemma [\ref=l:approx.L2], we obtain

[formula]

where C3 > 0 is independent of A and FA.

Therefore

[formula]

which contradicts to

[formula]

for A large enough.

We have thus proved Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] for n = k.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=t:strong_open] is thus complete.
