On the Lorentzian minimal surfaces in [formula] with finite type Gauss map

Introductions

The notion of finite type mappings defined on the submanifolds of semi-Euclidean spaces has been extensively studied by several geometers after it was introduced by B. Y. Chen in late 1970's. Let [formula] denote the semi-Euclidean space with dimension m and index s whose metric tensor is given by

[formula]

and consider a submanifold M of the semi-Euclidean space [formula]. A smooth mapping φ defined on M into another semi-Euclidean space [formula] is said to be k-type if it can be expressed as a sum of finitely many eigenvectors of the Laplace operator of M, [\cite=ChenKitap] [\cite=ChenMakale1986] [\cite=ChenRapor]. Many important results about finite type mappings defined on semi-Riemannian submanifolds have appeared so far (cf. [\cite=Bleecker-Weiner] [\cite=ReillyHelvaci]).

In particular, the Gauss map of submanifolds has been worked in several articles in this direction after some results on the submanifolds with 1-type Gauss map or 2-type Gauss map had been given in [\cite=Chen-Piccinni]. The Gauss map ν of M is said to be k-type if it can be expressed as a sum of

[formula]

where ν0 is a constant vector and νi is a non-constant eigenvector of Δ corresponding to eigenvalue λi for [formula] with [formula] and Δ is the Laplace operator of M with respect to the induced metric of M. In addition, if one of these eigenvalues is zero, then ν is said to be a null k-type mapping.

However, the Laplacian of the Gauss map of several surfaces and hypersurfaces such as helicoids of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd kind, conjugate Enneper's surface of the second kind and B-scrolls in a 3-dimensional Minkowski space [formula], generalized catenoids, spherical n-cones, hyperbolical n-cones and Enneper's hypersurfaces in [formula] take the form

[formula]

for some smooth function f on M and some constant vector C ([\cite=UDur2] [\cite=Kim-Yoon]). A submanifold of a pseudo-Euclidean space is said to have pointwise 1-type Gauss map if its Gauss map satisfies [\eqref=PW1TypeDefinition] for some smooth function f on M and some constant vector C. In particular, if C is zero, it is said to be of the first kind. Otherwise, it is said to be of the second kind (cf. [\cite=Arslan-and] [\cite=CCK] [\cite=KKKM] [\cite=Choi-Kim] [\cite=UDur] [\cite=UDur3] [\cite=Kim-Yoon-2]).

On the other hand, the theory of minimal and quasi-minimal surfaces is one of the most interesting topics in the semi-Euclidean geometry. A surface in [formula] is said to be minimal or quasi-minimal if its mean curvature vector is zero or light-like respectively. In the very recent past, the classification of these type of surfaces are studied in some papers, in terms of type of their Gauss map, [\cite=Dursun-Arsan] [\cite=MinkowskiDursunTurgay] [\cite=MILOUSHEVA01] [\cite=NCTGenRelGrav]. In this paper, we focus on Lorentzian minimal surfaces in the Minkowski space-time [formula] with finite type Gauss map. In the Section 2, after we describe the notation that we will use in this paper, we give a short brief on the basic facts and definitions on the theory of submanifolds. In the Section 3, we focus on the Lorentzian surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map. In the section 4, we study minimal Lorentzian surfaces with 2-type Gauss map.

The surfaces we are dealing with are smooth and connected unless otherwise stated.

Prelimineries

Let M be an n-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian submanifold of the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. We denote Levi-Civita connections of [formula] and M by [formula] and [formula], respectively. The Gauss and Weingarten formulas are given, respectively, by

[formula]

for any tangent vector field X, Y and normal vector field ξ on M, where h, D and A are the second fundamental form, the normal connection and the shape operator of M, respectively. On the other hand, the shape operator A and the second fundamental form h of M are related by

[formula]

Relative null space at p of M is defined as

[formula]

We say M has degenerated relative null bundle if (Np(M),〈 , 〉) is a degenerated inner product space for all p∈M.

The Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci equations are given, respectively, by

[formula]

where R,  RD are the curvature tensors associated with connections [formula] and D, respectively, and

[formula]

Consider a Lorentzian surface Min [formula] and let {e1,e2;e3,e4} be a positively oriented local orthogonal frame field on M and {f1,f2} the pseudo-orthogonal base field of the tangent bundle of M given by [formula] and [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

where Δ, H and K are the Laplace operator, the mean curvature vector and the Gaussian curvature of M.

The smooth mapping

[formula]

is called the (tangent) Gauss map of M.

From [\eqref=LorSurfDelta] one can obtain

[formula]

for any smooth function [formula] and any smooth mappings [formula], where [formula] is the gradient of φ defined by

[formula]

We will use the following well-known lemmas, [\cite=ONeillKitap].

In a non-degenerated inner product space with index of 1, two light-like vector are lindearly dependent if and only if they are orthogonal.

Let U be a subspace of a non-degenerated inner product space V. U is non-degenerated if and only if [formula]

The following lemma obtained in [\cite=FuHou2010] is very useful.

[\cite=FuHou2010] Let M be a Lorentzian surface in a semi Euclidean space [formula]. Then there exist local coordinates (s,t) such that the induced metric is of the form of

[formula]

where m = m(s,t) is a non-vanishing function, I1, I2 are some open intervals. Moreover, the Levi-Civita connection of M is given by

[formula]

Minimal Lorentzian surfaces and their Gauss map

Let M be a Lorentzian minimal surface. Then its tangent and normal Gauss map ν and μ satisfy

[formula]

where K and KD are the Gaussian and the normal curvature, respectively.

Consider a pseudo-orthogonal base field {f1,f2} of the tangent bundle of M. As M is minimal, we have H = 0 from which and [\eqref=LorSurfH] we have h(f1,f2) = 0. By a direct calculation, we obtain

[formula]

where ζi is a function defined by [formula] for i = 1,2. As h(f1,f2) = 0, Codazzi equation [\eqref=MinkCodazzi] implies

[formula]

On the other hand, using Gauss and Ricci equations [\eqref=MinkGaussEquation] and [\eqref=MinkRicciEquation], we obtain

[formula]

From [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2Ara1]-[\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2Ara4] we obtain [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ].

First, we prove these type of surfaces given above has pointwise 1-type Gauss map. If M is a minimal surface lying in a Lorentzian hyperplane Π of [formula], then [\cite=UDur2] implies that M has pointwise 1-type Gauss map (also see [\cite=UDur]). Now, let M be a surface with degenerated relative null bundle. Then, there exists a local pseudo-orthonormal base field {f1,f2} of the tangent bundle of M such that h(f1,f1) = h(f1,f2) = 0. Thus, M is minimal and [formula] from which and the equation [formula] we obtain that [formula]. Hence, [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ] implies that M has pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

Now, we want to prove the remaining part of the proposition.

Let M be a Lorentzian surface in [formula] and s,t be the local coordinates given in Lemma [\ref=EMsLorSurfgf1f2]. Consider the pseudo-orthogonal basis {f1,f2} given by

[formula]

If we suppose that M is minimal, i.e., [formula], then [\eqref=LorSurfH] implies that h(f1,f2) = 0. On the other hand, the Gauss map [formula] of M satisfies [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ].

Now, we assume that M has pointwise 1-type Gauss map of the first kind. Then [\eqref=PW1TypeDefinition] is satisfied for C = 0. From [\eqref=PW1TypeDefinition] and [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ] we obtain [formula] from which we get [formula]. Thus, h(∂s,∂s) and h(∂t,∂t) are linearly dependent.

Let [formula] be an isometric immersion of M and consider the functions

[formula]

and

[formula]

Case (1): [formula] or [formula]. In this case, M has degenerated relative null bundle.

Case (2): [formula] and [formula]. In this case, the initial value problems

[formula]

and

[formula]

admit unique solutions, say φ1 and φ2, respecetively, where s0∈I1 and t0∈I2. Let S,T be local coordinates given by S = φ1(s) and T = φ2(t). Then, we have g =  - 2(S,T)(dSdT + dTdS), where (S,T) = m(φ1(s),φ2(t)). Moreover, the normal vector fields h(∂S,∂S) and h(∂T,∂T) are linearly dependent and unit. Thus, we have

[formula]

Now, let {e3,e4} be an orthonormal base field of normal bundle of M with e3 = h(∂S,∂S). From Codazzi equation [\eqref=MinkCodazzi] we obtain D∂Th(∂S,∂S) = D∂Sh(∂T,∂T) = 0. Therefore [\eqref=TransSurfhsshtt] implies that De3 = 0, i.e., e3 is parallel. As M has codimension of 2, e4 is also parallel. Moreover, by using [\eqref=MinkAhhRelatedby], we obtain A4 = 0 because of [\eqref=TransSurfhsshtt]. Thus, we have [formula], i.e., e4 is constant. Hence, M is contained in a hyperplane Π. As e4 is space-like, Π is Lorentzian.

Next, we obtain the following proposition.

If M is a Lorentzian minimal surface, then [\eqref=LorSurfH] implies h(f1,f2) = 0 from which and [\eqref=MinkAhhRelatedby] we have 〈A3f1,f2〉  =  〈A4f1,f2〉 = 0 for any pseudo-orthonormal frame field {f1,f2,e3,e4}. In addition, the Gauss map [formula] of M satisfies [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ].

Now, we assume that the Gauss map ν of M satifies [\eqref=PW1TypeDefinition] for [formula]. From [\eqref=PW1TypeDefinition] and [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ], we have

[formula]

As C is a constant vector, we have fi(C) = 0, i = 1,2 from which and [\eqref=THMFULLCLASSC] we obtain fi(C12) = fi(C34) = 0 and Thus, C12, C34 are constants. On the other hand, from [\eqref=THMFULLCLASSfiCALL] we have

[formula]

By a direct calculation, we have

By combaining [\eqref=THMFULLCLASSAra001]-[\eqref=THMFULLCLASSAra002ALL], we obtain

[formula]

As [formula], from the last equation we have h(f1,f1) and h(f2,f2) are orthogonal.

Consider the open subset [formula] of M is not empty and let {e3,e4} be a local orthonormal base field of the normal bundle of M such that h(f1,f1) = α3e3 and h(f2,f2) = α4e4 over U, where α3 and α4 are some functions. From [\eqref=THMFULLCLASSfiCALL], we have on U. From these equations, we have A3f1 = A4f2 = 0 on U which implies [formula], because of [\eqref=MinkAhhRelatedby]. However, this is a contradiction if U is not empty.

Therefore, we have h(f1,f1) = 0 or h(f2,f2) = 0 which yields that M has degenerated relative null bundle. Thus, Proposition [\ref=PropE41MinLor1stkind] implies M has pointwise 1-type Gauss map of the first kind which leads a contradiction.

Let M be a Lorentzian surface in [formula], x its position vector and {s,t} some local coordinates given in Lemma [\ref=EMsLorSurfgf1f2] satisfying [\eqref=EMsLorSurfgf1f2Levi]. Consider the tangent vector fields [formula] and [formula].

Now, assume that Np(M) is degenerated for all p∈M. Because of Lemma [\ref=WellKnownLemmaNonDeg], we may assume Np(M) = {f1}. which implies h(f1,f1) = h(f1,f2) = 0. From these equations and [\eqref=EMsLorSurfgf1f2Levi] we have [formula] and [formula] from which we obtain [formula] and xst = 0 By integrating these equations and re-defining s properly, we obtain that M is congruent to the surface given by [\eqref=DegRelNullSpaceSurfPosVect].

By combaining all of the results given in this section, we state

Let M be a Lorentzian minimal surface in [formula]. Also suppose that no open part of M is contained in a hyperplane of [formula]. Then, the following conditions are logically equivalent

M has pointwise 1-type Gauss map;

M has pointwise 1-type Gauss map of the first kind;

M has harmonic Gauss map;

M has degenerated relative null bundle;

M has flat normal bundle;

M is congruent to the surface given by [\eqref=DegRelNullSpaceSurfPosVect] for a constant light-like vector [formula] and a null curve β in [formula] satisfying [formula].

We also want to state the following corollary of this theorem.

Minimal surfaces with 2-type Gauss map

Let M be a Lorentzian minimal surface. Then its tangent and normal Gauss map ν and μ satisfy

[formula]

where K and KD are the Gaussian and the normal curvature, respectively.

Let M be a Lorentzian surface in the Minkowski space [formula] and ν and μ its tangent and normal Gauss map. We assume that ν satisfies

[formula]

for a smooth fuction f. We note that

[formula]

where [formula] From [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ] and [\eqref=LemmaDeltaSQRf1f2EQ]-[\eqref=KKDinLambda] we obtain

Now, we consider a pseudo orthogonal frame field {f1,f2,e3,e4} on M. Then we have

[formula]

from which and [\eqref=Delta2nufDnuEq03] we have

Now, consider the open subset [formula] of M and assume that it is non-empty, i.e. either K or KD is non-constant. From [\eqref=Delta2nufDnuEq02ALL], we have either (h311)2 + (h411)2 = 0 or (h322)2 + (h422)2 = 0 on U. Thus, we have 〈h(f1,f1),h(f2,f2)〉 = 0 and 〈[A3,A4]f!,f2〉 = 0 on U. From these equations, [\eqref=MinkGaussEquation] and [\eqref=MinkRicciEquation] we obtain K = KD = 0 on U which yields a contradiction.

Therefore, we have K and KD are constants. Note that if KD = 0, then [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ] implies that M has 1-type Gauss map. Therefore, from [\eqref=Delta2nufDnuEq02] we have f = 4K. Next, we put this equation into [\eqref=Delta2nufDnuEq01] and obtain K = KD = 0. Hence, [\eqref=LemmaDeltaf1f2EQ] implies Δν = 0. Hence, we have

Let M be a Lorentzian minimal surface in the Minkowski space [formula]. If the Gauss map ν of M satisfies [\eqref=Delta2nufDnu], then f is constant and M is 1-type.
