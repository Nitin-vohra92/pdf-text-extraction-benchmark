Introduction

Let M be a manifold and Σh be the symmetric group on h elements. The ordered and unordered configuration spaces of h distinct points in M, [formula] and Ch(M) = Fh(M) / Σh, have been widely studied. In recent papers ([\cite=BP] [\cite=MPS] [\cite=MS]), new configuration spaces were introduced when M is, respectively, the projective space [formula], the affine space [formula] and the Grassmannian manifold Gr(k,n) of k-dimensional subspaces of [formula], by stratifying the configuration spaces Fh(M) (resp. Ck(M)) with complex submanifolds Fih(M) (resp. Cih(M)) defined as the ordered (resp. unordered) configuration spaces of all h points in M generating a subspace of dimension i. The homotopy groups of those configuration spaces are interesting as they are strongly related to the homotopy groups of the Grassmannian manifolds, i.e. of spheres. In [\cite=BP] (resp. [\cite=MPS]), the fundamental groups [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula] and [formula]) are computed, proving that the former are trivial and the latter are isomorphic to the symmetric group Σh except when i = 1 (resp. i = 1 and i = n = h - 1) providing, in this last case, a presentation for both [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula] and [formula]) which is similar to those of the braid groups of the sphere. In this paper we generalize the results obtained in [\cite=BP] when M is the projective space [formula], to the case of Grassmannian manifold Gr(k,n) of k-dimensional subspaces of [formula]. We prove that if Fih(k,n) is the i-th ordered configuration space of all distinct points [formula] in the Grassmannian manifold Gr(k,n) whose sum is a subspace of dimension i, then the following result holds.

The i-th ordered configuration spaces Fih(k,n) are all simply connected if k > 1.

From this, we immediately obtain that the fundamental group of the i-th unordered configuration space Fih(k,n) / Σh is isomorphic to Σh. These results are stated in Section [\ref=s:uno]. In Section [\ref=s:due] we compute the second homotopy group of the i-th configuration spaces in two special cases: the case in which the subspaces are in direct sum and the case of two subspaces.

The first homotopy group of Fih(k,n)

Let Gr(k,n) be the grassmannian manifold parametrizing k-dimensional subspaces of [formula], 0 < k < n. In [\cite=MS] authors define the space Fih(k,n) as the ordered configuration space of all h distinct points [formula] in Gr(k,n) such that the dimension of the sum dim[formula] equals i.

The following easy facts hold:

if h = 1, Fih(k,n) is empty except for i = k and Fk1(k,n) = Gr(k,n);

if i = 1, Fih(k,n) is empty except for k,h = 1 and [formula];

if h  ≥  2 and k = n - 1 then Fih(k,n) is empty except for i = n, and, since the sum of two (different) hyperplanes is [formula], [formula];

if h  ≥  2 then [formula] if and only if i  ≥  k + 1 and i  ≤   min (kh,n);

if h  ≥  2 then [formula], with the open stratum given by the case of maximum dimension i = min(hk,n);

if h  ≥  2 then the adjacency of the strata is given by

[formula]

As the case k = 1 has been treated in [\cite=BP] and, by the above remarks, the case h = 1 is trivial, in this paper we will consider h,k > 1 (and hence i > k).

In [\cite=MS], authors proved that Fih(k,n) is (when non empty) a complex submanifold of Gr(k,n)h of dimension i(n - i) + hk(i - k), and that if i = min(n,hk) and n  ≠  hk then the open strata Fih(k,n) are simply connected except for n = 2 (and k = 1), i.e.

[formula]

where h(S2) is the pure braid group on h strings of the sphere S2.

In order to complete this result and compute fundamental groups in all cases we need two Lemmas.

Let [formula] be an element in the space Fih(k,n) and denote the sum [formula] by γ(V), then the map

[formula]

is a locally trivial fibration with fiber Fih(k,i).

Let V0 be an element in the Grassmannian manifold Gr(i,n). Fix L0∈Gr(n - i,n) such that [formula] and let [formula] be the linear projection on V0 given by the direct sum. If Fih(k,V0) is the ordered configuration space of h distinct k-dimensional spaces in V0 whose sum is an i-dimensional subspace, then Fih(k,V0) coincides with Fih(k,i) when a basis in V0 is fixed.

Let UL0 be the open neighborhood of V0 in Gr(i,n) defined as

[formula]

The restriction of the projection φ to an element V in UL0 is a linear isomorphism φV:V  →  V0 and a local trivialization for γ is given by the homeomorphism which makes the following diagram commute.

This completes the proof.

The projection map on the first h - 1 entries

[formula]

is a locally trivial fibration with fiber [formula].

Let V0 be an element in Fk(h - 1)h - 1(k,kh). Fix L0∈Gr(k,kh) such that [formula] and let [formula] be the linear projection on γ(V0) given by the direct sum. The fiber of the projection map pr over V0 is the open set

[formula]

which is homeomorphic to [formula] (it is a coordinate chart for the Grassmannian manifold Gr(k,hk)).

Let UL0 be the open neighborhood of V0 in Fk(h - 1)h - 1(k,kh) defined as

[formula]

If V is a point in UL0, the restriction of the map φ to γ(V) is a linear isomorphism V:γ(V)  →  γ(V0) that can be extended to an isomorphism φV of [formula] by requiring it to be the identity on L0. A local trivialization for the projection pr is given by the homeomorphism which makes the following diagram commute.

This completes the proof.

Let us remark that if [formula] is a point in the space Fkhh(k,n), i.e. i = kh, then the h subspaces [formula] are in direct sum and the map is well defined. With a similar argument to the one used in Lemma [\ref=lem:pr] it can be proved that this map is a locally trivial fibration even if [formula]. In this case the fiber (which can be described as the union of coordinate charts UW of the Grassmannian manifold) is still simply connected but not homotopically trivial.

We have, from the homotopy long exact sequence of the fibration pr, that

[formula]

for all j and, by equation ([\ref=casodiretto]), that

[formula]

It follows that the open stratum Fkhh(k,kh) is simply connected, hence all open strata are simply connected. Moreover, from the homotopy long exact sequence of the fibration γ, we have that

[formula]

As Fih(k,i) is an open stratum, it is simply connected and hence π1(Fih(k,n)) = 0.

That is all our configuration spaces are simply connected and Theorem [\ref=teo:prin] is proved.

The second homotopy group

In this section we compute the second homotopy group π2(Fih(k,n)) when i = hk, i.e. subspaces in direct sum, and when h = 2, i.e. the case of two subspaces. In order to compute those homotopy groups, we need to know that the third homotopy group for Grassmannian manifolds is trivial if k > 1. Even if it should be a classical result we didn't find references and we decided to give a proof here.

Let Vk,n be the space parametrizing the (ordered) k-uples of orthonormal vectors in [formula], 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. It is an easy remark that V1,n = S2n - 1 and Vn,n = U(n). It's well known that the function that maps an element of Vk,n to the subspace generated by its entries is a locally trivial fibration:

[formula]

while the projection on the last entry is the locally trivial fibration:

[formula]

The fibration in ([\ref=fibr:del]) induces the long exact sequence in homotopy

[formula]

If n = k = 2, since V1,1 = S1, the sequence in ([\ref=hom]) becomes: that is [formula], π2(V2,2) = 0, [formula]. If n > 2 by ([\ref=hom]) we get isomorphisms πi(Vk,n)≃πi(Vk - 1,n - 1), 1 ~   ≤   ~ i ~   ≤   ~ 3. This implies that, if k = n then πi(Vn,n)≃πi(Vn - 1,n - 1)≃πi(V2,2), thus [formula], π2(Vn,n) = 0, [formula]. Otherwise πi(Vk,n)≃πi(Vk - 1,n - 1)≃π1(V1,n - k + 1) and hence π1(Vk,n) = 0, π2(Vk,n) = 0, π3(Vk,n) = 0 except if k = n - 1 in which case [formula].

By the above considerations, the exact sequence of homotopy groups associated to the fibration ([\ref=fibr:inc]) for k < n - 1 becomes that is π1(Gr(k,n)) = 0, [formula] and π3(Gr(k,n)) = 0 if k < n - 1. If k = n - 1 then [formula] and π3(Gr(n - 1,n)) = 0 except if n = 2 in which case Gr(1,2) = S2 and [formula]. That is the third homotopy group of the Grasmannian manifold Gr(k,n) is trivial if k > 1.

Since the third homotopy group of the Grasmannian manifold Gr(k,n) is trivial if k > 1 then for i < n the homotopy long exact sequence of the fibration γ defined in equation ([\ref=map:gamma]) gives :

[formula]

As the second homotopy groups are abelian and the above short exact sequence splits, we have

[formula]

The case i = hk.

If i = hk, by equation ([\ref=om:pr]), π2(Fhkh(k,hk)) = π2(Fk(h - 1)h - 1(k,hk)) and the following equalities hold:

[formula]

while, if hk < n, [formula].

The case h = 2.

If h = 2 a point (H1,H2) is in the space Fi2(k,n) if and only if the dimension of intersection dim[formula]. If i = 2k (which includes the cases k = 1 and n = 2) H1 and H2 are in direct sum otherwise the following Lemma holds.

If i < 2k, the map is a locally trivial fibration with fiber F2i - 2k2(i - k,n - 2k + i).

Let V0 be a point in the Grassmannian manifold Gr(2k - i,n). Fix L0∈Gr(n - 2k + i,n) such that [formula] and let [formula] be the linear projection given by the direct sum. The fiber η- 1(V0) is the set of all pairs (H1,H2) of k-dimensional subspaces of [formula] such that [formula]. That is, a pair (H1,H2) is in η- 1(V0) if and only if it corresponds to a pair of (i - k)-dimensional subspaces of [formula] are in direct sum, i.e. a point in F2(i - k)2(i - k,n - 2k + i).

Let UL0 be the open neighborhood of V0 in Gr(2k - i,n), defined as

[formula]

If V is a point in UL0, the restriction of φ to γ(V) is a linear isomorphism V:V  →  V0 that can be extended to an isomorphism φV of [formula] by requiring it to be the identity on L0.

A local trivialization for η is the homeomorphism This completes the proof.

By the homotopy long exact sequence of the map η, we get:

[formula]

and hence [formula]. By the previous case, π2(F2(i - k)2(i - k,n - 2k + i)) is equal to [formula] if 2(i - k) = n - 2k + i, that is if i = n, and is equal to [formula] otherwise. So, we get [formula] and [formula] if i < n.
