Abstract. The c-dimension of a group G is the maximal length of a chain of nested centralizers in G. We prove that a locally finite group of finite c-dimension k has less than 5k nonabelian composition factors.

Keywords: locally finite group, nonabelian simple group, lattice of centralizers, c-dimension.

Introduction

Let G be a group and CG(X) be the centralizer of a subset X of G. Since CG(X) < CG(Y) if and only if CG(CG(X)) > CG(CG(Y)), it follows that the minimal and the maximal conditions for centralizers are equivalent. Thus the length of every chain of nested centralizers in a group with the minimal condition for centralizers is finite. If a uniform bound for the lengths of chains of centralizers of a group G exists, then we refer to maximal such length as c-dimension of G following [\cite=MS]. The same notion is also known as the height of the lattice of centralizers. It is worth to observe that the class of groups of finite c-dimension includes abelian groups, torsion-free hyperbolic groups, linear groups over fields and so on. In addition, it is closed under taking subgroups and finite direct products, but the c-dimension of a homomorphic image of a group from this class is not necessary finite.

In 1979 R. Bryant and B. Hartley [\cite=BH] proved that a periodic locally soluble group with the minimal condition for centralizers is soluble. In 2009 E. I. Khukhro published the paper [\cite=Khukhro], where, in particular, he proved that a periodic locally soluble group of finite c-dimension k has the derived length bounded in terms of k. The same paper contains the conjecture attributed to A. V. Borovik, which asserts that the number of nonabelian composition factors of a locally finite group of finite c-dimension k is bounded in terms of k. The purpose of our work is to prove this conjecture.

Given a locally finite group G, denote by η(G) the number of nonabelian composition factors of G.

The following well-known fact (see, for example, [\cite=Meier]) helps us to derive the theorem from the corresponding statement for finite groups.

If G is a locally finite locally soluble simple group, then G is cyclic.

Recall that the factor group of a finite group G by its soluble radical R is an automorphism group of a direct product of nonabelian simple groups. Thus, if the socle Soc(G / R) is a direct product of nonabelian simple groups S1, S2, [formula], Sn, then G / R is a subgroup of the semidirect product [formula], where Symn permutes S1, S2, [formula], Sn. By the classification of the finite simple groups, the group of outer automorphisms of a finite simple group is soluble. Therefore, every nonabelian composition factor of G is either a composition factor of Soc(G / R), or a composition factor of the corresponding subgroup of Symn.

Next three lemmas give an upper bound for the number of nonabelian composition factors of a subgroup of Symn. We denote by μ(G) the degree of the minimal faithful permutation representation of a finite group G.

Let G be a finite group. Let [formula] be a class of finite groups closed under taking subgroups, homomorphic images and extensions. If N is the maximal normal [formula]-subgroup of G, then [formula].

Let S1, S2, [formula], Sr be simple groups. Then [formula].

If G is a subgroup of a symmetric group Symn, then [formula].

Remark. The group Symn, where n = 5k with [formula], contains a subgroup G isomorphic to the permutation wreath product [formula], where the wreath product is applied k - 1 times. We have [formula].

The following lemma is a key for bounding the number of composition factors of Soc(G / R) for a finite group G.

If an elementary abelian p-group E of order pn acts faithfully on a finite nilpotent p'-group Q, then there exists a series of subgroups [formula] such that all inclusions [formula] are strict.

As usual, Op(G) stands for the largest normal p-subgroup of a finite group G, while Op'(G) denotes the largest normal p'-subgroup of G. If a series of commutator subgroups of a group G stabilizes, then we denote by G(  ∞  ) the last subgroup of this series. A quasisimple group is a perfect central extension of a nonabelian simple group. The layer E(G) is the subgroup of G generated by all subnormal quasisimple subgroups of G, the latter are called components of G. Recall that the layer is a central product of components of G.

Let G be a finite group of c-dimension k. Then η(G) < 5k.

Proof of the theorem. Now G is locally finite group. Assume [formula]. Let {Gi}i∈I be a composition series of G, where Gi is a proper subgroups of Gj for i < j. Let S1, S2, [formula], S5k be pairwise distinct nonabelian composition factors of G. By Lemma [\ref=lfsg] every locally finite nonabelian simple group contains a finite insoluble subgroup. Thus, we may choose finite subsets X1, X2, [formula], X5k of G such that the image of Xi in Si generates an insoluble group. Suppose that H is the finite subgroup of G generated by the union of the sets X1, X2, [formula], X5k. Then [formula] is a subnormal series of H having at least 5k insoluble factors. This contradicts Proposition [\ref=FiniteCase]. The theorem is proved.
