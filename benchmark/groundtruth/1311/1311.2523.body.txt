Predicting Stellar Angular Sizes

Introduction

Stellar surface brightness is directly related to stellar broad-band color, and it is also a function of stellar apparent magnitude and angular size ([\cite=wes69] [\cite=bar76]). These dependencies can be combined to show that the stellar angular size can be predicted from stellar photometry, even in the presence of interstellar extinction:

[formula]

where θLD is the limb-darkening corrected angular stellar diameter in milliarcseconds, mλ is the apparent stellar magnitude in the λ-band, and X is the broad-band stellar color λ1  -  λ2. The family of functions expressed by Eq. [\ref=eq1] for different photometric bands is referred to as "surface brightness relations" in the literature (see for instance [\cite=ker04] [\cite=bon06] [\cite=ker08]).

Methods

In [\cite=boy13b], we fit polynomials of the form of Eq. [\ref=eq1] for 48 commonly used color indices in the astronomical literature (e.g., B - V,V - I, etc), based on literature broad-band photometry of 124 main sequence stars with interferometrically determined stellar radii with precision of better than 5%, which were obtained with the CHARA Array (see [\cite=boy12a] [\cite=boy12b] [\cite=boy13a]). We provide updates to and refinements of previously published surface brightness relations based on a larger sample of directly measured angular diameters. Typical random errors in the predictions of stellar radii are 4-10%. We find a metallicity dependence for the B - V colors, but not for the other ones.

Application

As photometric broad-band magnitudes and colors are (relatively) straightforward to obtain for stars at distances or brightness levels at which interferometric radius measurements are not currently possible, the applications of the surface brightness relations in stellar astronomy are nearly ubiquitous. We use our relations to calculate the stellar diameter of GJ 667C, a late-type dwarf in a triple system, which is known to host between two and seven exoplanets ([\cite=ang13]). Application of our surface brightness relations to literature VJHKs data for GJ 667C, coupled with distance estimates by [\cite=del13], produces a stellar radius estimate of [formula].
