Anisotropic magneto-thermal transport and Spin-Seebeck effect

Exploiting the properties of heat currents in magnetic systems for data processing and storage is a decisive challenge for the future of electronic devices and sensors. Recent research efforts, in line with spintronics developments, focus more specifically on the properties of the spin degrees of freedom associated to the electric charges and heat currents [\cite=SpinCal]. Important series of experiments - the so-called spin-pumping and spin-Seebeck measurements - have been performed in this context [\cite=Uchida] [\cite=Jaworsky] [\cite=Uchida2] [\cite=Sharoni] [\cite=Huang] [\cite=RezendePRL] [\cite=Rezende] [\cite=Chumak] [\cite=Costache] [\cite=Sandweg] [\cite=Uchida3]: a magneto-voltaic signal is observed at zero electric current on electrodes that are in thermal contact with a ferromagnet. Surprisingly, for these experiments, the ferromagnetic layer used is indifferently conductor, semiconductor or insulator.

A predominant role of spin degrees of freedom has first been assumed in order to interpret the experiments (typically in terms of transfer of pure-spin-current through the interface and inverse-spin-Hall effects inside the electrode). However, some authors suggest that anomalous Nernst effect (i.e., a thermoelectric bulk effect that is not explicitly spin-dependent) may suffice to explain the observations [\cite=Ohno] [\cite=Zink] [\cite=Chien] [\cite=Back] [\cite=Yin] [\cite=Short_Cut]. The problem is then to understand how the non-ferromagnetic electrode could mimic the behavior of the underlaying insulating or conducting ferromagnet [\cite=Kikkawa].

The interpretation proposed here is based on the anisotropic thermal properties of ferromagnets (see Fig.1). It is shown that under heat current injection, an anisotropic temperature gradient is generated in the ferromagnet and transmitted to the electrode due to the thermal contact. This temperature gradient induces a thermocouple between the extremities of the electrode, which can be measured by a voltmeter. The anisotropic thermal transport equations is derived on the basis of the Onsager reciprocity relations. The signal follows the same angular dependence as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the planar Hall effect (PHE).

In conducting ferromagnets, the thermoelectric counterparts of AHE and PHE are well known in terms of anomalous and planar Nernst effect (ANE and PNE), that can be measured with a transverse electrode (i.e. on a Hall-cross device: see Fig.1). ANE, AHE and AMR have the same spin-orbit scattering origin [\cite=AMR] [\cite=Ky] [\cite=Nagaosa] which is responsible for the anisotropy of the electric response. The anisotropy of the thermal transport has been measured recently by Kimling et al. [\cite=Nielsch] in Ni nanowires. This effect is generalized below to thermal transport in both conductors or insulators. The anisotropy is imposed by the direction of the magnetization with respect to the current flowing in the thin layer, i.e. by a unit vector [formula] defined by the polar angle θ and the azimuthal angle φ.

Electric transport equations

The AMR effect is described by the Ohm's law, with the help of the Onsager reciprocity relations. An electric current [formula] is defined locally (at each point of the material) with the help of a conductivity tensor σ̂ such that [formula], where μe is the local electrochemical potential and q is the electric charge. It a thin ferromagnetic layer is oriented in the plan {[formula],[formula]} perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetization (the general case of an arbitrary polarization orientation (θ,φ) is considered below), the ohm's law reads :

[formula]

where the off-diagonal coefficients σH is defined by the microscopic mechanisms that couples the spin-dependent electric carriers and the magnetization (skew scattering, side-jump scattering, intrinsic effect, etc) [\cite=Nagaosa]. However, whatever the details of the microscopic origin, the microscopic time invariance symmetry is associated to spin-rotational symmetry, so that the Onsager reciprocity relation imposes [\cite=OnsagerII] [\cite=DeGroot] [formula]. We assume furthermore that the material is isotropic at zero magnetization (most of the experiments are performed on polycrystalline materials). We have consequently σxx  =  σyy  =  σ, but σz  ≠  σ due to the magnetization anisotropy.

Since the experiments are usually performed in the galvanostatic mode (i.e., constant current [formula]), it is convenient to invert the Ohm's law Eq.([\ref=Conductivity]) with introducing the resistivity tensor   =  σ̂- 1. In the vectorial form we have:

[formula]

where ρ  =  σ / (σ2  +  σ2H), ρH  =  σH / (σ2  +  σ2H) and ρz  =  σ- 1z. Eq.([\ref=AMR]) is the general vectorial expression for electronic transport that takes into account spin-orbit interactions [\cite=AMR]. After integration over the sample, the first term in the right hand side of Eq.([\ref=AMR]) defines the usual resistance, the second term is the AMR effect (including the planar Hall contribution), and the last term defines the anomalous Hall effect.

Thermal transport equations

In this section, we treat a system which is not in contact to an electric generator. Instead, the ferromagnetic degrees of freedom are excited by a specific energy source. This is the case for magnetic fields (e.g. ferromagnetic resonance excitation or magnetization reversal), temperature gradient, magneto-optic excitations, magneto-mechanic excitations, etc. We consider here only the situation for which the heat currents [formula] is equal to the energy current [formula] (the thermodynamic relation [formula] links the two currents [\cite=Wegrowe13]).

In the case of electric conductors, the thermoelectric transport equations are well-known [\cite=DeGroot]. For electric current we have

[formula]

and for heat current we have:

[formula]

where λ̂ is the heat conductivity tensor, [formula] is the Seebeck tensor, Π̂  =   - Tσ̂ is the Peltier tensor. In the case of isotropic materials, all matrices verify the same Onsager symmetry relation and the matrices λ̂ and [formula] have the same form as that of the electric conductivity Eq.([\ref=Conductivity]) [\cite=DeGroot]:

[formula]

where λ is the the thermal conductivity, λRL is the Righi-Leduc coefficent, and the anisotropy λz  ≠  λ is attested by the thermal conductance measurements performed on ferromagnets [\cite=Nielsch].Similarly,S and Sz are the Seebeck coefficients and SN is the Nernst coefficient.

In the case of ferromagnetic insulators, Eq. ([\ref=ThermoCurrentA]) is zero, and Eq. ([\ref=ThermoCurrentB]) is modified in order to introduce the relevant transport coefficients. The total chemical potential F, related to the ferromagnetic degrees of freedom, can be defined with the effective magnetic field: [formula], where F contains a drift term and a diffusion term F  =  μF  +  kT  ln(nF) (the drift ferromagnetic chemical potential μF and the density of magnons nF have been defined in references [\cite=Wegrowe13] [\cite=PRB08] [\cite=Entropy] for the uniform mode). In the insulating ferromagnet, the anisotropic thermal transport equation is described by the Onsager matrix [formula] [\cite=Wegrowe13]:

[formula]

where the cross-coefficient of the matrix [formula] follows the same reciprocity relation Lxy  =  Lyx  =  LRL as for the electric conductivity tensor σ̂, the thermal conductivity tensor λ̂ and the Seebeck tensor [formula], while the anisotropy Lz  ≠  L is due to the anisotropy of the ferromagnet [\cite=Nielsch] [\cite=Wegrowe13]. Eq. ([\ref=ThermoCurrentC]) reads:

[formula]

or, in vectorial form:

[formula]

where ΔL  =  Lz  -  L is the thermal anisotropy and LRL is the Righi-Leduc coefficient [\cite=DeGroot] (or "magnon Hall" coefficient for ferromagnetic insulators [\cite=thermal_Hall1] [\cite=thermal_Hall2]). Note that Eq.([\ref=Thermal_AMR_B]) is formally equivalent to the general expression for the AMR (Eq.([\ref=AMR])) if we replace the heat current [formula] by the electric current [formula], the generalized force [formula] by the electric field [formula], and the electric transport coefficients by the thermal transport coefficients:

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=Thermal_AMR_C]) should be used if the stationary heat current [formula] is imposed by external sources while Eq.([\ref=Thermal_AMR_B]) is convenient if the generalized force [formula] is imposed (this is the same distinction as for galvanostatic or potentiostatic configurations for electric measurements). The appropriate description depends on the experimental boundary conditions. In the context of spin pumping and Spin Seebeck experiments, the heat current is imposed by the boundary conditions, and the local gradient of the chemical potential (near the electrode) can be reduced to a gradient of temperature [formula]. Eq.([\ref=Thermal_AMR_C]) reads:

[formula]

where r  =  λ / (λ2  +  λ2RL) and rRL  =  λ / (λ2  +  λ2RL) are the thermal resistivity and Δr  =  1 / λz  -  λ / (λ2  +  λ2RL) is the anisotropic thermal resistivity.

Anisotropic magneto-thermal transport

In the previous discussion, the orientation [formula] of the magnetization was taken perpendicular to the plane (Ox,Oy) of the thin ferromagnetic layer, and the Hall and Nernst voltages were measured perpendicular to both the heat current and the magnetization. However, in the experimental context, the magnetization is oriented at an arbitrary direction with respect to the reference frame defined by the plane of the ferromagnetic layer [formula] and the unit vector [formula] perpendicular to both [formula] and [formula] .

If the magnetization [formula] is oriented at the polar angle θ and the azimuthal angle φ we have [formula], where mx  =  sin(θ)cos(φ), my  =  sin(θ)sin(φ) and mz  =  cos(θ). The angular dependence of the temperature gradient [formula] generated by the anisotropic heat current JQ(θ,φ) is given by Eq.([\ref=Righi_Leduc]):

[formula]

In well designed experimental situations, the heat current [formula] is oriented along the [formula] direction only (in the case of a heat current oriented perpendicular to the plane [formula] the result is the same with the transformation θ  +  π / 2  →  θ). The temperature gradient generated in the ferromagnet is then given by:

[formula]

Thermocouple effect on the electrode

A temperature difference generated by [formula] in the ferromagnet layer can be measured on an electrode thanks to the thermocouple effect. The electric potential [formula] generated along [formula] is given by Eq.([\ref=ThermoCurrentA]) with [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. ΔS and ΔSN are the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients of the electrode (typically Pt) with respect to the Seebeck coefficients of the electric wires used to measure the potential (typically Cu, Ag or Au that have close Seebeck coefficients). In the expression of ΔVy Eq. ([\ref=Result]), the term proportional to the normal Nernst coefficient of the non-ferromagnetic electrode ΔSN, has the same angular dependence as the AMR measured along the current direction: [formula]. However, like for normal Hall effect in a moderate external magnet field (<  10 T), we have SN  ≪  S, so that only the first term should be significant (see however the results at high fields reported in [\cite=Shi]). The principal contribution to the anisotropic magneto-thermal effect ΔyV in Eq.([\ref=Result]) contains two terms, corresponding to "anomalous" and "planar" Hall or Nernst effects:

[formula]

The second term in the right hand side of Eq.([\ref=thermocouple]) (the "anomalous" contribution), proportional to cos(θ) corresponds to the magnetization-perpendicular-to-the-plane (MPP) geometry. The maximum signal (given by the difference between the voltages measured at θ  =  0 and θ  =  π / 2 for φ  =  0) is ΔVMPPy  =  JQxΔSrRL. The first term in the right hand side of Eq.([\ref=thermocouple]) (the "planar" contribution) corresponds to the magnetization-in-the-plane geometry (MIP) (measured between φ  =  0 and φ  =  π / 2 for θ  =  0) is ΔVMIPy  =  JQxΔSΔr.

In the case of MIP, the anisotropic magneto-thermal coefficient Δr / r has been measured recently by Kimling et al. [\cite=Nielsch] in Ni nanowires, and is of the same order than the AMR (i.e., one percent). For a typical Hall cross (the width L of the ferromagnetic thin film is the same as the width of the transverse electrode), we have ΔVMIPy  =  JQΔS(Δr / r) / (λd), where d is the thickness of the thin layer, which is typically 10 nm. This thickness dependence of the form 1 / d is due to the simplest geometry for the thermal resistance (r  =  L / (λLd)) and for the Seebeck thermocouple (constant ΔS for identical section Ld of the ferromagnetic layer and the electrode placed in continuity). The heat conductivity is of the order of λ  ≈  100 W / (mK), and the Seebeck coefficient difference is of the order of ΔS  ≈  1 μV / K for Pt-noble metal contacts. With Δr / r  ≈  1% and heat power JQx  ≈  1 mW we have ΔVy  ≈  10 μV.

Note that for both MIP and MPP signals, the magneto-voltaic signal vanishes if the Seebeck coefficient of the electrode is equal to that of the wire used for the electric contacts: ΔS  ≈  0μV (typically for Cu, Au and Ag electrodes, as already observed), and the sign of ΔVy is inverted by choosing an electrode for which ΔS  <  0 (this is the case with using Ta instead of Pt).

Conclusion

The application of the Onsager reciprocity relation to heat transport coefficients in a ferromagnet leads to consider an anisotropic heat transport effect in ferromagnetic conductors and insulators (anomalous Righi-Leduc effect or thermal Hall effect). A characteristic angular dependence of the temperature gradient is predicted, that follows that of anomalous Nernst (magnetization perpendicular-to-the-plane) and planar Nernst (magnetization in-the-plane) effects. The amplitude of the first effect is proportional to the anisotropic thermal resistance Δr, and the second effect is proportional to the Righi-Leduc thermal resistance rRL. The thermocouple effect generated by this temperature gradient on the non-magnetic electrode in thermal contact to the ferromagnet induces a voltage [formula] that mirrors this specific angular dependence.
