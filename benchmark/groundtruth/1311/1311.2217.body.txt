Microrheology measurements with a hanging-fiber AFM probe

Introduction

The development of the study of complex fluids needs measurements at micrometer scale to observe local properties of the media. Furthermore one often needs to measure the viscosity of very small liquid samples. For these reasons several microrheology techniques have been developed. The most common is based on the measurement of the Brownian motion properties either by tracking several free micrometer beads or by trapping them in optical tweezers [\cite=Gittes] [\cite=Mason] [\cite=Solano]. Both techniques need a transparent fluid but an alternative method has been recently proposed in ref. [\cite=SMR_viscosity]. This method is based on an excited suspended microchannel resonator and it works for viscosities less than . In ref. [\cite=Tong], which measures the thermal fluctuations of a hanging-fiber Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) probe. This method is interesting and presents several advantages with respect to the other ones: a) It can work with large viscosities; b) the fluid has not to be transparent; c) the amount of needed fluid can be very small. However this technique has been analyzed only around the system's resonance because of the limited sensitivity of the apparatus.

In this paper we analyze the advantages and drawbacks of this method with a very low-noise AFM. This improved sensitivity allows us to measure relatively high viscosities and most importantly to develop a model for the fiber-fluid interaction, which is more appropriate and precise than that of ref. [\cite=Tong]. Thus the results of this paper are not only useful for microrheology measurements of rather viscous and opaque fluids but also to investigate the basic dissipation mechanisms of a thin fiber inside a fluid and to give more insights to the mechanical coupling of such microdevices.

Experimental set-up

The measurement of the fluid viscosity is performed using a cylindrical micro-rod fixed to an AFM cantilever, as sketched in fig.[\ref=fig:setup]. The rod is immersed into the fluid whose friction along its length produces an extra damping for the cantilever, which is detected by measuring the thermal noise of the cantilever

The rod is fabricated using an optical single-mode fiber, stretched under the flame of a blowtorch: its initial [formula] diameter is thinned to [formula]. The fiber is glued at the apex of an AFM cantilever with a two-components epoxy adhesive (Araldite). We use standard AFM cantilevers (Budget Sensors AIO): soft ones with a stiffness [formula] and a resonance frequency [formula], and stiffer ones with [formula] and [formula] (resonant frequencies after functionalization of the tip). A particular effort is done to glue the fiber as perpendicular to the cantilever as possible to avoid torsion modes. The fiber is cut at the appropriate length (around [formula]) using a sharp tweezer and a diamond tool. These operations are performed under a bright light microscope with a x20 magnification, using micromanipulators (from Narishige). Finally the fiber characteristics are checked with the microscope images (fig.[\ref=fig:setup]).

The hanging-fiber probe is mounted on a home-built atomic force microscope. The deflection z of the cantilever (figure [\ref=fig:setup]) is measured by an interferometric deflection sensor [\cite=Paolino-2013], inspired by the original design of Schonenberger [\cite=Schonenberg-RSI-89] with a quadrature phase detection technique [\cite=2002Bellon]: the interference between the reference laser beam reflecting on the static base and the sensing beam on the tip of the cantilever gives a direct measurement of the deflection with a very high accuracy (see spectra fig.[\ref=profondeurs]). This technique offers a very low intrinsic noise (down to [formula]  [\cite=Paolino-2013]) and it is intrinsically calibrated. Indeed, contrary to the standard optical lever technique, measuring the angular deflection of the laser beam, the interferometric techniques measures directly the cantilever deflection in term of the laser wavelength. Thanks to this high resolution, no external excitation of the cantilever is required, and its thermal fluctuations can be measured over a wide frequency range.

The viscosity measurement is performed using the same fiber with 4 different liquids: alcanes (dodecane and hexadecane) and silicon oils (10v and 20v, respectively of viscosity and ) chosen for their range of viscosity, their weak evaporation, and their good wetting of the glass fiber. The liquid is put in a [formula] diameter copper container placed under the fiber; the liquid layer is about [formula] deep. When changing the liquid, the fiber is rinsed thoroughly with the new liquid, and the copper container is rinsed as well before putting fresh liquid in it. Silicon oils have been studied after alcanes, in an increasing order of viscosity. The pool can be moved along the vertical axis Z by a piezo-actuator. The measurements are performed at 250C

In order to change the vertical height h between the tip of the fiber and the undisturbed surface of the liquid (see fig. [\ref=fig:setup]), the position Z of the container is changed in [formula] steps. We wait a few seconds after the displacement before starting the measurement to let the fluid relax. The origin of the height h is located with a [formula] uncertainty either from the jump of the static deflection due to the capillary force on the fiber or from the sudden broadening of the noise spectra between two displacement steps. The error on the relative height results from the mechanical drift of the actuation mechanism and the evaporation of the liquid, and is estimated to be lower than [formula] for a typical [formula] dipping experiment.

The cantilever deflection is sampled for at least [formula], with a 24bits resolution, at [formula] for the soft cantilever and [formula] for the stiff one. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the deflection is calculated with a resolution of about [formula] for the data in liquid and [formula] for data in air. The spectra are averaged more than 1000 times in order to reduce the statistical noise.

Data analysis and parameters definition

In figs. [\ref=profondeurs] and [\ref=HFhexadecane] the measured PSD [formula] of the cantilever deflection induced by the thermal noise is plotted at several dipping depth h in hexadecane for the soft and stiff cantilevers. The broadening of the resonance peak shows the increase of damping as a function of h.

In order to check the quality of the measurement and to extract a reliable value of the viscosity one has to fit the PSD in a wide frequency range. As there is no external force acting on the system, we can use the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem (FDT) [\cite=deGroot], linking the mechanical response function of the total system to the PSD Sz(f) of the cantilever deflection z:

[formula]

where G = G' + iG'' is the the inverse of mechanical response function of the total system, [formula] is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, [formula] stands for imaginary part and ω = 2π  f is the angular frequency. For a Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) with viscous damping for example, the response function is [\cite=deGroot]:

[formula]

with k, m and γ respectively the stiffness, mass and damping coefficient of the SHO.

A model for the damping

The key point is to have a reliable model for G and most importantly of the damping coefficient of this system, assuming that the fiber is a cylinder oscillating along its axis. As far as we know there are no exact analytical solutions to this problem and one has to do several approximations. The starting point is the Stokes' solution for the drag of a sphere oscillating at frequency ω in a fluid of viscosity η and density ρ [\cite=landau]. Supposing that there are only geometric corrections for the fiber we can write the dissipation γc of the fiber-cantilever system as:

[formula]

where [formula] is the viscous penetration length and b a generic geometric factor to be determined (b = b(h,d) may depend on the values of h and d). An approximated solution for the viscous coefficient γ0 for a fully immersed rod is [\cite=broersma]:

[formula]

where the constant [formula] is the sum of the dissipation in the liquid meniscus and of the effective dissipation of the cantilever in air. The coefficient ε is a correction (smaller than 1), which depends on the shape of the fiber's cross section . Except for the correction in ln (h / d), γ0 has a leading linear behavior in our range of h. As pointed out in ref. [\cite=landau] the term in [formula] in eq.[\ref=drag_coeff] becomes relevant only if d > δ, thus it can be usually neglected at low frequencies. Using eq.[\ref=drag_coeff], we can compute [\cite=landau] the storage modulus G' and the loss modulus G'' of the fiber-cantilever system:

[formula]

where kc is the stiffness of the cantilever, km is the meniscus stiffness, mc is the effective mass of the cantilever-fiber system, and [formula] is the mass of the displaced fluid. In our case, [formula] represents in the worst case of a totally immersed fiber only 3% of mc and it will be neglected. km is of the order of magnitude of the liquid's surface tension, a few tens of mN/m; we will not consider its possible frequency dependance in this work. Inserting expressions [\ref=real] and [\ref=imaginary] in eq.[\ref=fdt.0] we get an expression for Sz that can be used to fit the measured PSD of the cantilever deflection z. Note that this way we consider the cantilever-fiber system as a SHO with a frequency dependent damping coefficient γc and a frequency dependent added mass that can be viewed as the mass of fluid in the boundary layer.

This model, which takes into account the effect of the boundary layer to compute dissipation, will be noted model [formula] and the predicted spectrum [formula] will be used to fit the experimental measurement. Four free parameters have to be adjusted to fit the data: k = kc + km, mc, γ0 and [formula]. However when the resonance frequency is small enough (i.e. d < δ ) then we may impose  = 0. Thus, in this case, we recover the classic [formula] model, noted [formula] (i.e.  = 0), leading to the spectrum [formula]

Simple Harmonic Oscillator

We consider first the SHO model for the soft cantilever. Indeed at the resonance frequency ([formula]), δ varies between [formula] for dodecane and [formula] for silicon oil v20, thus for all the liquids that we use [formula] and [formula] can be neglected. We therefore fit the spectra using [formula] which has the advantage of having only three free parameters.

In order to measure γ0 we proceed in the following way. To begin with, we simply fit the resonant frequency peak, as done in ref. [\cite=Tong], for each dipping depth h and each liquid. This method is not very precise because the values of γ0 depend on the chosen fitting range around the soft resonance. Therefore, one has to decide a criterium to select this fitting range, which, in our case, is chosen in order to have the best fit in the largest part of the spectra The results of these fits around the resonance peak are shown in fig.[\ref=profondeurs]. We notice that the spectra [formula] do not fit properly our data at low frequency where some extra noise is present below [formula]. The use of one more free parameter with model [formula] does not improve the quality of the fitting, because the additional terms deform the [formula] noise spectrum even further away from our data.

In order to understand where the noise increase at [formula] is coming from, we analyze more precisely the spectra in fig.[\ref=profondeurs]. We notice that the spectrum in air presents another resonance at about [formula], which corresponds to the first flexion mode of the fiber oscillations. This resonance disappears when the fiber is immersed. To find out what happens to this resonance, we decided to do the same measurement with the same kind of fiber (length and diameter) on a more rigid cantilever having a resonance around [formula]. The aim is to avoid damping the fiber noise in the inertial tail of the resonance. The spectra measured in air and in hexadecane using this stiffer cantilever-fiber system are plotted in figure [\ref=HFhexadecane]. In the spectrum in air, we clearly see the resonance of the cantilever at and the resonance of the fiber at , at approximately the same frequency than the previous system. When the fiber is dipped into the fluid this resonance becomes over-damped and the cut-off frequency goes towards low frequencies close to [formula]. In contrast, the resonance of the stiff cantilever behaves similarly to that of the soft one, presenting a continuous broadening of the resonance peak as a function of h. All these remarks suggest that there is probably a coupling between the fiber and the cantilever oscillations which perturbs the simple picture of a SHO.

Coupled oscillators

Let us develop a model of Coupled Harmonic Oscillators (CHO) for the cantilever (deflection z) and the fiber (deflection y of its extremity). In a first approximation, the cantilever motion corresponds to a forcing of the clamping base of the fiber along its axis, thus we will neglect the effect of the cantilever deflection on that of the fiber. The fiber is thus modeled as a classic SHO and in the Fourier transform yω of its deflection y is described by:

[formula]

where mf, γf and kf are respectively the effective mass, dissipation and stiffness of the fiber and Ff is a delta correlated thermal noise acting on the fiber, whose spectrum is SFf = 4kBTγf.

The fiber motion translates into a torque of the cantilever end, thus the equation describing the Fourier transform zω of z is coupled to the fiber deformation y:

[formula]

where G' and G'' are defined in eqs. [\ref=real] and [\ref=imaginary], and Fc is a delta correlated thermal noise, whose spectrum is SFc = 4kBTγc. The term αy (with α the coupling coefficient) assumes the simplest coupling with the deflection of the fiber y. The PSD [formula] of z can be computed from eqs. [\ref=motion.fiber] and [\ref=motion.cantilever] by making the very reasonable hypothesis that Ff and Fc are uncorrelated noise. We get:

[formula]

where n stands for either 0 or B depending whether we impose  = 0 or not. Eq.[\ref=coupled.spectra] can be written in a more compact form:

[formula]

where Sy is the PSD of the fiber thermal noise. When the fiber is dipped into the fluid, we notice that the motion of the fiber is over-damped. We can thus simplify and set:

[formula]

where τf  =  γf / kf is the relaxation time of the fiber.

We can try to fit our data with these [formula] models, i.e. eq. [\ref=coupled.spectra.simple] and [\ref=fiber.spectra.simple]. Because of the large number of parameters in the model we proceed in the following way using first the model [formula] with  = 0. We begin to fit the spectrum around the cantilever resonance to estimate γ0 and to obtain a first approximation of [formula]. Inserting this first approximation in eq. [\ref=coupled.spectra.simple], we can fit the expression [formula] with a Lorenztian, from which the values of kf  /  α2 and τf are obtained. Using these values in eq.[\ref=coupled.spectra.simple] one can improve the fit of [formula] and repeat the iteration. After 3 iterations the values of the parameters become stable and we obtain a good fit on the whole frequency range (figure [\ref=HFhexadecane]). The [formula] fits well the resonant peak as can be seen in the inset of fig.[\ref=HFhexadecane]. However we see that the fit is not correct around [formula] where the fitting curve is systematically above the data. The problem could come from the fact that we perform the fit around the resonance at [formula] keeping  = 0. At such a high frequency the [formula] model is probably not adequate because the boundary layer thickness δ is about , which is close to the fiber diameter. Thus one should use the [formula] model which takes into account the boundary layer effects.

To fit the data with [formula], we use the same iteration approach with one difference: to reduce the number of free parameters, the stiffness and mass are now fixed to the values measured in air, [formula] and [formula]. This is justified because the other contributions to the stiffness and mass are negligible with respect to the values in air in the high frequency experiment. After several iterations we get a correct fit of the data except around the resonance (see inset figure [\ref=HFhexadecane]) where the fit [formula] is higher than the data. This indicates that this model for the cantilever's resonance at high frequency is not perfect. Thus we conclude that in order to discriminate between the two models ( = 0 and [formula]), we would need an even larger frequency range. One could check at low frequencies, where [formula] has a dependence in [formula] instead of the flat curve of [formula]. But in our data, the low frequency part is hidden by Sy(f). On the other hand one could use the high frequency part of the spectra. Indeed at high frequency, [formula] should decrease in ω- 7 / 2 instead of ω- 4 of [formula]. But in this case the intrinsic noise of the interferometer hides the data and this comparison is not possible. Besides, we could see in air the second mode of the fiber very close to the cantilever's resonance on most high frequency probes we tested, so that this mode may also disturbs the cantilever's resonance. As a result, it is not possible to clearly separate the two contributions to the dissipation γc from our measured noise spectra.

We can see in fig.[\ref=stiffHF] the evolution of the stiffness kf and the dissipation γf of the fiber lateral oscillations as a function of dipping depth estimated from the two models. It is interesting to notice that the values obtained from the two models are very close and have a dependence on h which is quite reasonable. Except at the very beginning , the stiffness is constant as expected. Instead, the dissipation increases and tends to saturate at large h. This behavior can be understood considering that γf is the damping of the deflection mode of the fiber which has a large displacement at the free extremity and a small one towards the anchoring point. Therefore the non moving part of the fiber will not contribute to dissipation and γf increases fast at small h (region of large lateral displacement) and saturates above a certain h (region of small displacement). From this data it is possible to have the order of magnitude of α. Indeed taking into account the size of the fiber and its Young modulus one estimates kf≃0.1N / m and α≃0.06  -  0.07 which is a reasonable value for the coupling

Looking at fig.[\ref=profondeurs] we notice that the resonance of the fiber in air is about at the same frequency for the soft probe as for the stiffer one . We can thus suppose that the cut-off frequency when the fiber is immersed is also around , that is to say, at the left of the cantilever resonance. Therefore we can use the same iteration than before to analyze our spectra using eq.[\ref=fiber.spectra.simple] for the spectrum of the fiber and model [formula]. On figure [\ref=pviscosite], we can see fits for each liquid at [formula]. We see that now the model fits our data properly on the whole frequency range. We can also see on fig.[\ref=stiffHF] the same evolution for the stiffness and the dissipation of the fiber. Data are noisier than those at high frequency because the resonance of the cantilever is closer to the cut-off frequency of the fiber.

Viscosity measurement at low frequency

In order to perform viscosity measurements, we choose to focus on low frequency measurements, which present several benefits when compared to high frequency measurements. Firstly the hanging-fiber probes are less difficult to fabricate on softer and longer cantilevers. Secondly, the signal over noise ratio is much higher with soft cantilevers. Finally, the viscosity measurement is based on the dissipation γ0, and requires neither the calibration of the unknown coefficient b not the knowledge of the liquid's density ρ.

We extract the dissipation coefficient γ0 for each liquid at each depth from the [formula] fitting procedure on the soft probe's data. The results are plotted in fig.[\ref=h_liquid]a), where we can see a linear behavior as a function of h in the displayed immersion range where h / d  >  6. The error bars take into account the standard deviation of the mass and the stiffness of the cantilever during the dipping. Our range in h is too small to measure the logarithmic correction of eq.[\ref=slope] and we rewrite it as: [formula], where c is a parameter that depends on the geometry of the probe. From the plot of fig.[\ref=h_liquid]a), we extract the slope 2πcη for each liquid, and plot it in fig.[\ref=h_liquid]b) as a function of the tabulated viscosity η. The data are aligned on a straight line which correctly crosses the (0,0) point with a slope 2πc = 3.67  ±  0.07. We thus obtain c = 0.58  ±  0.01.

This value is interesting because it clearly excludes that γ0 is simply given by eq.[\ref=slope]. Indeed for our measuring range 6 < h / d < 30 and for - 1 < ε < 0 one finds that the function h / ( ln (h / d) + ε) is well approximated by a straight line (c'  h + co') with c' always very close to 0.2, which is incompatible to the measured value of c. This difference is not so surprising since the model in ref. [\cite=broersma] considers a fully immersed fiber whereas it crosses the liquid-air interface in our system, and a small transverse component in the driving by the cantilever also contributes to the measured dissipation. Thus it is necessary to calibrate c for each fiber in order to have reliable results.

Conclusion

In this article, we have presented a passive measure of the local viscosity at micrometer scale for a range of viscosity between and at least , with 5% of accuracy for its absolute value. We have proposed a model which takes into account the fiber-cantilever coupling, and have shown that this model fits the thermal noise spectra. By increasing the resonant frequency of the cantilever, we could clearly separate the frequency of the first mode of the cantilever and the first mode of the fiber. This increases the quality of the data for the fiber's mode but does not simplify the viscosity measurements from the cantilever's resonance We have tested a model taking into account the frequency dependent boundary layer terms (model [formula]), but couldn't discriminate it from a simpler [formula] model by fitting the measured spectra, despite our high resolution deflection sensor. As a result, we prefer using the simpler model with less free parameters. Finally, our data gives insights into the dissipation mechanism of a micro-fiber partially immersed in a viscous fluid.

This microrheology method based on a dipping fiber has several advantages. It does not require a transparent liquid, and only a very small amount of liquid is needed. The accessible viscosity range is limited at in our measurements because for lower viscosities the fiber's mode becomes to close to the cantilever's mode and cannot be separated from it. The upper viscosity bound has not been reached yet, since over-damped motion for higher viscosities can still be analysed.

This method calls nevertheless for some precautions. Using functionalized cantilevers is often a good idea but it is necessary to check the influence of added elements [\cite=justine]. Here, the fiber-cantilever coupling can strongly affect the accuracy of the results. Finally, we assumed a no-slip boundary condition on the fiber, which is justified because the intrinsic slip length remains below for simple liquids [\cite=audrey] (while it reaches micrometric scale for polymer melts [\cite=leger]). Beware that boundary slippage can strongly affect the b and c coefficients when working with nano-fibers like in ref. [\cite=ondarcuhu] [\cite=yazdanpanah] or when studying polymer melts with micro-fibers as in [\cite=sauer].
