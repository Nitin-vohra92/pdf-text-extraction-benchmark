An application of liaison theory to the Eisenbud-Green-Harris conjecture

Introduction

The Eisenbud-Green-Harris (EGH) conjecture is a famous open problem in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. If true, it would imply the generalized Cayley-Bacharach conjecture [\cite=EisenbudGreenHarris1993:EGHConjecture], generalize the classic Clements-Lindström theorem [\cite=ClementsLindstrom1969] in combinatorics, as well as extend Macaulay's characterization [\cite=Macaulay1927] of the Hilbert functions of homogeneous ideals in a polynomial ring S: = k to the case of homogeneous ideals containing a given S-regular sequence.

There are several equivalent formulations and slight variations of the EGH conjecture in the literature; see [\cite=FranciscoRichert2007:LPPIdeals] for a good overview. Given a proper ideal I of a Noetherian ring R, we say I minimally contains an [formula]-regular sequence of forms (i.e. homogeneous polynomials) if I has depth r, the minimum degree of the forms in I is a1, and for each 2  ≤  i  ≤  r, the integer ai is the smallest degree such that I contains an R-regular sequence [formula] of forms of degrees [formula] respectively. In this paper, we work with the following version of the conjecture.

Let [formula] be integers. If [formula] is a homogeneous ideal that minimally contains an [formula]-regular sequence of forms, then there exists a homogeneous ideal [formula] containing [formula], such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.

The EGH conjecture is known to be true in some cases. Richert [\cite=Richert2004:StudyLPPConjecture] settled the case n = 2, Francisco [\cite=Francisco2004:AlmostCIandLPPConj] proved the case when I is an almost complete intersection ideal, Caviglia and Maclagan [\cite=CavigliaMaclagan2008:EGHConj] showed that the conjecture is true when [formula] for all 1  ≤  j < n, and Abedelfatah [\cite=Abedelfatah2012:EGHConjPreprint] proved the conjecture when every fi is a product of linear forms. In the special case when ei  =  2 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, Richert [\cite=Richert2004:StudyLPPConjecture] claimed in unpublished work that the conjecture holds for n  ≤  5, Chen [\cite=Chen2011:thesis] gave a proof for n  ≤  4, Herzog and Popescu [\cite=HerzogPopescu1998:HilbertFunctionsGenericForms] proved that the conjecture holds if k is a field of characteristic zero and I is minimally generated by generic quadratic forms, while Gasharov [\cite=Gasharov1999:HilbertFunctionsHomogGenericForms] showed that Herzog-Popescu's result is still true when k is replaced by a field of arbitrary characteristic. As for the case n = 3, Cooper [\cite=Cooper:EGHPreprintCase3] proved the conjecture when e1  ≤  3 by considering the remaining cases not covered by Caviglia-Maclagan's result.

In contrast to these known results, we use liaison theory as our main tool. Licci ideals are homogeneous ideals in the liaison class of a complete intersection ideal, and projective schemes defined by licci ideals are fundamental objects studied in liaison theory. In this paper, we introduce a new subclass of licci ideals, which we call 'sequentially bounded', and we prove that the EGH conjecture holds for every sequentially bounded licci ideal that 'admits a minimal first link' (Theorem [\ref=thm:SeqBoundedLicci]); see Section [\ref=sec:SeqBoundedLicci] for a precise definition of such licci ideals. As an important consequence, we show that the EGH conjecture holds for Gorenstein ideals in the case of three variables:

Let 2  ≤  e1  ≤  e2  ≤  e3 be integers. If [formula] is a homogeneous Gorenstein ideal that minimally contains an (e1,e2,e3)-regular sequence of forms, then there exists a monomial ideal J in k containing xe11,xe22,xe33, such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=mainThm-Gorenstein] uses Migliore-Nagel's recent result [\cite=MiglioreNagel2010:MinimalLinksResultGaeta] in liaison theory, which in turn relies on the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud structure theorem [\cite=BuchsbaumEisenbud1977] on Gorenstein ideals of height three. We hope that further advances in liaison theory would give more insight into proving the EGH conjecture.

Liaison Theory

Let [formula] and [formula] denote the non-negative and positive integers respectively. Define the set [formula] for each [formula], and let [formula]. Given [formula], [formula] in [formula], let [formula], and write [formula] if ai  ≤  bi for all i∈[n]. For brevity, let [formula] denote the n-tuple [formula].

Throughout this paper, S: = k is a standard [formula]-graded polynomial ring on n variables over an infinite field k. All ideals, whether contained in S or otherwise, are assumed to be homogeneous and proper, and for any minimal set of generators of a given ideal, we always assume the generators are homogeneous. Given [formula] a collection of forms in S, write 〈A〉 or [formula] to mean the ideal of S generated by A. A multicomplex M is a collection of monomials that is closed under divisibility (i.e. if m∈M and [formula] divides m, then [formula]). For [formula], write [formula] to mean the monomial [formula].

For any ring R and any ideal I  ⊂  R, let [formula] denote the depth of I. We say I is perfect if [formula] equals the projective dimension of R / I. A complete intersection ideal (CI ideal) of R is an ideal generated by an R-regular sequence of forms, and an almost complete intersection ideal of R is a perfect ideal I that is minimally generated by [formula] elements. If [formula] is a CI ideal such that [formula], then [formula] is called the type of J (as a CI ideal).

Given a finitely generated graded S-module [formula], let H(R, - ) denote its Hilbert function, i.e. H(R,d): =  dim kRd for each [formula], and let [formula] denote the socle of R. We say R is Gorenstein if it is a Cohen-Macaulay module of Krull dimension r, and [formula] for some R-regular sequence [formula]. Note that complete intersection ideals are Gorenstein.

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay ring, and let I,I  ⊂  R be ideals of height r. If there exists a CI ideal J  ⊂  R of height r satisfying [formula], [formula] and [formula], then we say I and [formula] are (algebraically) directly linked (by J), and we write [formula], or simply [formula] (if the ideal J is not important). This binary relation ~   is called direct linkage, and the ideal J is called a link.

Direct linkage is symmetric, but not necessarily reflexive or transitive. Taking its transitive closure, we get an equivalence relation called liaison (or linkage). Equivalently, we have the following definition:

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay ring, and let [formula] be ideals of height r. If there exists a finite sequence of ideals [formula] ([formula]) of height r, such that I0  =  I, [formula], and [formula], then we call "[formula]" a sequence of links from I to [formula], we say s is the length of this sequence, and we say I and [formula] are (algebraically) linked. This binary relation (that I and [formula] are linked) is an equivalence relation called liaison (or linkage), and each equivalence class is called a liaison class. An ideal that is in the liaison class of a CI ideal is called licci.

In our definition of liaison, we require that the links are CI ideals. This can be generalized by allowing links to be Gorenstein ideals, which yields the notion of Gorenstein liaison. The prefixes 'CI-' and 'G-' (for complete intersection and Gorenstein respectively) are usually attached to distinguish between the two definitions, e.g. CI-liaison, G-linked, etc.. Currently, Gorenstein liaison theory is an area of active research [\cite=Gorla2008:GeneralizedGaetaThm] [\cite=Hartshorne2007:GeneralizedDivisorsAndBiliaison] [\cite=HartshorneSabadiniSchlesinger2008] [\cite=KleppeMiglioreMiro-RoigNagelPeterson2001] [\cite=MiglioreNagel2002:MonomialIdealsGLiaisonClassOfCI] [\cite=MiglioreNagel2010:MinimalLinksResultGaeta], and there are many open problems on whether results in CI-liaison theory can be extended analogously in G-liaison theory; see [\cite=KleppeMiglioreMiro-RoigNagelPeterson2001]. In this paper, we only use CI-liaison theory and hence do not use the 'CI-' prefix. For a good introduction to liaison theory, see [\cite=book:MiglioreIntroLiaisonTheory].

The notion of liaison is (more commonly) defined for projective schemes as follows: Let V1,V2 be equidimensional subschemes of [formula] of codimension r, and let X be a complete intersection scheme of codimension r containing both V1 and V2. If the defining ideals IV1,IV2,IX (of V1,V2,X respectively) satisfy [formula], IX:IV1  =  IV2 and IX:IV2  =  IV1, then we say V1 and V2 are (algebraically) directly linked, and we write [formula], or simply V1  ~  V2. The equivalence relation generated by (the transitive closure of) ~   is called liaison, and we can define link, liaison class, etc. analogously.

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay ring, and let [formula] be ideals of height r. If I minimally contains an [formula]-regular sequence of forms, and I and [formula] are directly linked by a CI ideal J of type [formula], then we say J is a minimal link. If I and [formula] are linked, and there exists a sequence of links from I to [formula] such that each link is minimal, then we say I is minimally linked to [formula]. An ideal that is minimally linked to a CI ideal is called minimally licci.

Given linked ideals I and [formula] of S, there are many possible sequences of links from I to [formula] of varying lengths, and much work has been done on understanding licci ideals and their corresponding sequences of links. Gaeta [\cite=Gaeta1948] showed that every Cohen-Macaulay ideal of height two is minimally licci, while Peskine and Szpiro [\cite=PeskineSzpiro:Liaison] proved that an ideal of height two is licci if and only if it is Cohen-Macaulay. However, these results do not extend to ideals of height ≥  3. Not every Cohen-Macaulay ideal of height three is licci [\cite=HunekeUlrich1987:StructureOfLinkage], and for every r  ≥  3, there are licci ideals of height r that are not minimally licci [\cite=HunekeMiglioreNagelUlrich2007]. Nevertheless, Watanabe [\cite=Watanabe1973:NoteOnGorenSteinRings] showed that every Gorenstein ideal of height three is licci, while Migliore and Nagel [\cite=MiglioreNagel2010:MinimalLinksResultGaeta] recently proved that every Gorenstein ideal of height three is minimally licci.

Sequentially Bounded Licci Ideals

In this section, we weaken the notion of 'minimally licci ideals' and define a subclass of licci ideals that we call 'sequentially bounded'. In particular, minimally licci ideals are sequentially bounded licci ideals. As the main result of this section, we prove that the EGH conjecture holds for every sequentially bounded licci ideal that 'admits a minimal first link', which we now define precisely:

Let I be a licci ideal of height r. Suppose there exists a sequence of links [formula] from I0  =  I to a CI ideal Is, such that [formula] (as CI ideals) have types [formula] respectively and satisfy [formula]. Then I is called a sequentially bounded licci ideal. Furthermore, if J1 is a minimal link, then we say I is a sequentially bounded licci ideal that admits a minimal first link.

Let [formula] be integers. If [formula] is a sequentially bounded licci ideal that admits a minimal first link and minimally contains an [formula]-regular sequence of forms, then there exists a monomial ideal [formula] containing [formula] such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.

Before we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:SeqBoundedLicci], we need the following useful theorem on Hilbert functions under liaison. Let I,J be (homogeneous) ideals of S such that J  ⊆  I. If S / J is an Artinian Gorenstein ring, and [formula], then H(S / I,t)  =  H(S / J,t)  -  H(S / (J:I),s - t) for all 0  ≤  t  ≤  s.

Let [formula] be a sequence of links from I0  =  I to a CI ideal Is, where J1 is a minimal link. Let [formula] denote the types of [formula] respectively (as CI ideals), and assume [formula]. Note also that [formula], since Js and Is are CI ideals satisfying Js  ⊆  Is. For each i∈[s  +  1], write [formula], and let Γi be the collection of all monomials in S that divide [formula]. Also, define the collections of monomials [formula] recursively as follows: Let [formula], and for each i∈[s], define

[formula] is a multicomplex, and [formula] for all i∈[s  +  1], [formula].

We shall prove both assertions of the claim simultaneously by induction on s + 2 - i (for i∈[s  +  1]). The base case is trivial: [formula] is clearly a multicomplex, and for all [formula]. In particular, [formula] forms a k-basis for [formula].

For the induction step, let [formula]. Since [formula] implies [formula] for all i∈[s], it then follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:HilbertFunctionsUnderLiaison] that H(S / Is - i,t) equals

[formula]

for every [formula].

Next, we prove that [formula] is a multicomplex. Choose an arbitrary q∈Γs + 1 - i such that [formula], and suppose qxj∈Γs + 1 - i for some j∈[n]. Clearly Γs + 1 - i is a multicomplex containing [formula], hence to prove that [formula] is a multicomplex, it suffices to show that [formula]. Now, qxj∈Γs + 1 - i implies x(a(s + 1 - i),j - 1)j does not divide q, which means xj divides [formula], so since [formula] is a multicomplex by induction hypothesis, we thus get [formula] which yields [formula].

With the above claim, we now complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:SeqBoundedLicci]. Let J  ⊂  S be the ideal spanned by monomials in S that are not contained in [formula]. Using the claim, [formula] is a multicomplex, hence [formula] forms a k-basis for S / J, and we get Finally, since J1 is a minimal link, we have [formula], so [formula] implies J contains [formula].

Let [formula] be integers. If I  ⊂  S is a minimally licci ideal that minimally contains an [formula]-regular sequence of forms, then there exists a monomial ideal in S containing [formula] with the same Hilbert function as I.

Given any sequence [formula] of minimal links, where J1 and J2 have types [formula] and [formula] respectively, the definition of liaison yields [formula], hence the minimality of J2 as a link implies [formula]. Consequently, a minimally licci ideal is a sequentially bounded licci ideal that admits a minimal first link, and the assertion follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:SeqBoundedLicci].

Theorem [\ref=mainThm-Gorenstein] is an immediate consequence of Corollary [\ref=cor:minimallyLicci=>EGH], since every Gorenstein ideal of height three is miminally licci [\cite=MiglioreNagel2010:MinimalLinksResultGaeta]. In fact, Migliore and Nagel [\cite=MiglioreNagel2010:MinimalLinksResultGaeta] proved a stronger result: If I is a Gorenstein ideal that is not a CI ideal, then linking I minimally twice gives a Gorenstein ideal with two fewer generators than I. Their proof uses Buchsbaum-Eisenbud's structure theorem [\cite=BuchsbaumEisenbud1977], which says that every Gorenstein ideal of height three is generated by the submaximal Pfaffians of an alternating matrix. Note that Watanabe [\cite=Watanabe1973:NoteOnGorenSteinRings] previously showed the minimal number of generators of every Gorenstein ideal of height three is odd.

Every ideal I  ⊂  S containing a maximal S-regular sequence is Artinian and hence Cohen-Macaulay. Since Gaeta's theorem [\cite=Gaeta1948] says every Cohen-Macaulay ideal of height two is minimally licci, Corollary [\ref=cor:minimallyLicci=>EGH] thus yields a different proof (cf. [\cite=Richert2004:StudyLPPConjecture], [\cite=CavigliaMaclagan2008:EGHConj]) that the EGH conjecture holds for n = 2.

Variations of the EGH Conjecture

There are two common variations of the EGH conjecture. Let [formula] be integers, and let [formula] be an S-regular sequence of forms of degrees [formula] respectively. If [formula] is a homogeneous ideal containing [formula], then there exists a homogeneous ideal [formula] containing [formula], such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.

Let r∈[n], [formula] satisfy [formula], and let [formula] be an S-regular sequence of forms of degrees [formula] respectively. If [formula] is a homogeneous ideal containing [formula], then there exists a homogeneous ideal [formula] containing [formula], such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.

Conjecture [\ref=conj:non-minimal-degrees] is clearly equivalent to the EGH conjecture, while Conjecture [\ref=conj:non-maximal-regularSeq] allows for non-maximal S-regular sequences, with the case [formula] being identical to [formula]. Remarkably, Caviglia and Maclagan [\cite=CavigliaMaclagan2008:EGHConj] showed that Conjecture [\ref=conj:non-maximal-regularSeq] is equivalent to the EGH conjecture. In particular, they showed that if r∈[n], [formula] satisfies [formula], and [formula] holds for all [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] for each i∈[r], then [formula] holds; and conversely, if [formula] holds for some [formula] and some [formula] satisfying [formula], then [formula] holds for all integers [formula].

By a modification of their proof, we show that [formula] holds for every sequentially bounded licci ideal that admits a minimal first link whenever n  ≥  r.

Let [formula] be ideals of height r < n, and let [formula] be an S-regular sequence of forms. Define [formula] and [formula]. If [formula], then for every [formula].

For convenience, write [formula] for each i∈{1,2}. The case j = 0 is trivial, so assume j  ≥  1. Observe that the identity I2  =  J:I1 yields

[formula]

while the identity I1  =  J:(J:I1) yields

[formula]

where [formula].

A routine check gives [formula]. To show the reverse inclusion [formula], note that sp∈J for every non-zero s∈S and non-zero p∈I1 satisfying sgjp∈J, since otherwise gj would be a zero-divisor of S / J, which contradicts the assumption that [formula] is an S-regular sequence. By the same argument, every [formula] satisfies [formula] for all t∈S such that tI1  ⊆  J. Consequently, each [formula] satisfies sI1  ⊆  J and hence satisfies [formula] for all [formula], which gives the reverse inclusion, so we conclude [formula]. A symmetric argument yields [formula].

Finally, since [formula] is an S-regular sequence, we get [formula]. It then follows from [formula] that [formula], therefore [formula].

Let r∈[n], let [formula] be integers, and let [formula] be an ideal (of height r) that minimally contains an [formula]-regular sequence of forms. If [formula] is a sequentially bounded licci ideal that admits a minimal first link (for example, I could be a minimally licci ideal), then there exists a monomial ideal [formula] containing [formula] such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.

We follow Caviglia-Maclagan's proof and similarly prove our proposition by induction on [formula], where the base case n - r = 0 is equivalent to Theorem [\ref=thm:SeqBoundedLicci]. Assume r < n, fix the integers [formula], and let [formula] be a sequence of links from I0 to a CI ideal Is, such that [formula] (as CI ideals) have types [formula] respectively and satisfy [formula]. In particular, Js and Is are CI ideals satisfying Js  ⊆  Is, so the last inequality [formula] is guaranteed. Also, assume J1 is a minimal link and [formula]. Since k is infinite and r < n, we can choose some linear form g that is a non-zero-divisor on each of [formula]. Consequently, for each i∈[s], we can define the CI ideal [formula] of type [formula].

Next, let [formula] be sufficiently large so that (I:g∞)  =  (I:gN). For each [formula] and [formula], define the ideal I(j)i: = (Ii:gj)  +  〈g〉. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:non-maximalCase], we get the sequence of links

[formula]

for every [formula], and we observe that each I(j)s is a CI ideal.

For each i∈[s], write [formula] so that [formula]. Also, write [formula] so that [formula]. The quotient ring R: = S / 〈g〉 is isomorphic to a polynomial ring on n - 1 variables, and by the natural quotient map π:S  →  R, the S-regular sequence [formula] descends to an R-regular sequence [formula] for each i∈[s  +  1]. In particular, [formula] is a CI ideal in R for all i∈[s]. By applying π to the ideals in [\eqref=eqn:seqLinks], we get the sequence of links [formula] for every [formula].

Now [formula] (as CI ideals) have types [formula] respectively, and for every [formula], the ideal π(I(j)s) is a CI ideal of type [formula], thus π(I(j)0) is a sequentially bounded licci ideal in R that admits a minimal first link. Using [formula], the induction hypothesis then says that for every [formula], there exists a monomial ideal in k containing [formula] with the same Hilbert function as π(I(j)0). Let Mj be the lex-plus-powers ideal in k containing [formula] with this same Hilbert function (which exists by Clements-Lindström theorem [\cite=ClementsLindstrom1969]), and let Kj  ⊆  k be the set of monomials Kj: = {mxjn:m∈Mj}.

Finally, consider the ideal K generated by the monomials in [formula]. As shown by Caviglia and Maclagan [\cite=CavigliaMaclagan2008:EGHConj], the ideal K contains [formula] and has the same Hilbert function as I, and their proof holds verbatim.

Let n  ≥  3, and let 2  ≤  e1  ≤  e2  ≤  e3 be integers. If [formula] is a homogeneous Gorenstein ideal (of height three) that minimally contains an (e1,e2,e3)-regular sequence of forms, then there exists a monomial ideal [formula] containing xe11,xe22,xe33, such that I and J have the same Hilbert function.
