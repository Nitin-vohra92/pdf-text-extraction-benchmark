On complex-analytic 1|3-dimensional supermanifolds associated with [formula].

E.G. Vishnyakova

Introduction.

A classical result is that we can assign the holomorphic vector bundle, so called retract, to each complex-analytic supermanifold (see Section 2 for more details). Assume that the underlying space of a complex-analytic supermanifold is [formula]. By the Birkhoff-Grothendieck Theorem any vector bundle of rank m over [formula] is isomorphic to the direct sum of m line bundles: [formula], where [formula]. We obtain a classification up to isomorphism of complex-analytic supermanifolds of dimension 1|3 with underlying space [formula] and with retract [formula], where [formula]. In addition, we give a classification up to isomorphism of complex-analytic supermanifolds of dimension 1|2 with underlying space [formula].

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we explain the idea of the classification. In Section 3 we do all necessary preparations. The classification up to isomorphism of complex-analytic supermanifolds of dimension 1|3 with underlying space [formula] and with retract (k,k,k) is obtained in Section 4. The last section is devoted to the classification up to isomorphism of complex-analytic supermanifolds of dimension 1|2 with underlying space [formula].

The study of complex-analytic supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] was started in [\cite=Bunegina_Oni]. There the classification of homogeneous complex-analytic supermanifolds of dimension 1|m, m  ≤  3, up to isomorphism was given. It was proven that in the case m = 2 there exists only one non-split homogeneous supermanifold constructed by P. Green [\cite=Green] and V.P. Palamodov [\cite=Ber]. For m  =  3 it was shown that there exists a series of non-split homogeneous supermanifolds, parameterized by [formula].

In [\cite=Vish] we studied even-homogeneous supermanifold, i.e. supermanifolds which possess transitive actions of Lie groups. It was shown that there exists a series of non-split even-homogeneous supermanifolds, parameterized by elements in [formula], three series of non-split even-homogeneous supermanifolds, parameterized by elements of [formula], and a finite set of exceptional supermanifolds.

Classification of supermanifolds, main definitions

We will use the word "supermanifold"  in the sense of Berezin - Leites [\cite=BL] [\cite=ley], see also [\cite=Bunegina_Oni]. All the time, we will be interested in the complex-analytic version of the theory. We begin with main definitions.

Recall that a complex superdomain of dimension n|m is a [formula]-graded ringed space of the form [formula], where FU is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on an open set [formula] and [formula] is the exterior (or Grassmann) algebra with m generators.

A complex-analytic supermanifold of dimension n|m is a [formula]-graded locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to a complex superdomain of dimension n|m.

Let M  =  (M0,OM) be a supermanifold and

[formula]

be the subsheaf of ideals generated by odd elements in OM. We put FM: = OM  /  JM. Then (M0,FM) is a usual complex-analytic manifold, it is called the reduction or underlying space of M. Usually we will write M0 instead of (M0,FM). Denote by TM the tangent sheaf or the sheaf of vector fields of M. In other words, TM is the sheaf of derivations of the structure sheaf OM. Since the sheaf OM is [formula]-graded, the tangent sheaf TM also possesses the induced [formula]-grading, i.e. there is the natural decomposition [formula].

Let M0 be a complex-analytic manifold and let [formula] be a holomorphic vector bundle over M0. Denote by E the sheaf of holomorphic sections of [formula]. Then the ringed space [formula] is a supermanifold. In this case dim   M  =  n|m, where n  =   dim M0 and m is the rank of [formula].

A supermanifold (M0,OM) is called split if [formula] (as supermanifolds) for a locally free sheaf E.

It is known that any real (smooth or real analytic) supermanifold is split. The structure sheaf OM of a split supermanifold possesses a [formula]-grading, since [formula] and the sheaf [formula] is naturally [formula]-graded. In other words, we have the decomposition [formula]. This [formula]-grading induces the [formula]-grading in TM in the following way:

[formula]

In other words, we have the decomposition: [formula]. Therefore the superspace H0(M0,TM) is also [formula]-graded. Consider the subspace

[formula]

It consists of all endomorphisms of the vector bundle [formula] inducing the identity morphism on M0. Denote by [formula] the group of automorphisms of [formula], i.e. the group of all invertible endomorphisms of [formula]. We have the action [formula] of [formula] on TM defined by

[formula]

Clearly, the action [formula] preserves the [formula]-grading ([\ref=filtr_of_T]), therefore, we have the action of [formula] on H1(M0,(TM)2).

There is a functor denoting by [formula] from the category of supermanifolds to the category of split supermanifolds. Let us describe this construction. Let M be a supermanifold and let as above JM  ⊂  OM be the subsheaf of ideals generated by odd elements of OM. Then by definition we have [formula], where

[formula]

In this case [formula] is a locally free sheaf and there is a natural isomorphism of [formula] onto [formula]. If [formula] is a morphism of supermanifolds, then [formula], where [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Recall that by definition every morphism ψ of supermanifolds is even and as consequence sends JpN into JpM.

The supermanifold [formula] is called the retract of M.

For classification of supermanifolds we use the following corollary of the well-known Green Theorem (see [\cite=Green], [\cite=Bunegina_Oni] or [\cite=DWitt] for more details):

Let [formula] be a split supermanfold of dimension n|m, where m  ≤  3. The classes of isomorphic supermanifolds M such that [formula] are in bijection with orbits of the action [formula] of the group [formula] on H1(M0,(TN)2).

Remark. This theorem allows to classify supermanifolds M such that [formula] is fixed up to isomorphisms that induce the identity morphism on [formula].

Supermanifolds associated with [formula]

In what follows we will consider supermanifolds with the underlying space [formula].

Supermanifolds with underlying space [formula]

Let M be a supermanifold of dimension 1|m. Denote by U0 and U1 the standard charts on [formula] with coordinates x and [formula], respectively. By the Birkhoff-Grothendieck Theorem we can cover [formula] by two charts

[formula]

with local coordinates [formula] and [formula], respectively, such that in [formula] we have

[formula]

where ki are integers. Note that a permutation of ki induces the automorphism of [formula]. We will identify [formula] with the set [formula], so we will say that a supermanifold has the retract [formula]. In this paper we study the case: m = 3 and k1 = k2 = k3 = :k. From now on we use the notation [formula] for the tangent sheaf of [formula].

A basis of [formula]

Assume that m  =  3 and that M  =  (k1,k2,k3) is a split supermanifold with the underlying space [formula]. Let T be its tangent sheaf. In [\cite=Bunegina_Oni] the following decomposition

[formula]

was obtained. The sheaf Tij2 is a locally free sheaf of rank 2; its basis sections over (U0,OM|U0) are:

[formula]

where l  ≠  i,j. In [formula] we have

[formula]

The following theorem was proven in [\cite=Vish]. For completeness we reproduce it here.

Assume that i < j and l  ≠  i,j.

[formula] For ki + kj > 3 the basis of [formula] is:

[formula]

[formula] for ki + kj = 3 the basis of [formula] is:

[formula]

[formula] for ki + kj = 2 and kl = 0 the basis of [formula] is:

[formula]

[formula] if ki + kj = 2 and kl  ≠  0 or ki + kj < 2, we have [formula].

Proof. We use the ech cochain complex of the cover [formula] as in 3.1, hence, 1-cocycle with values in the sheaf Tij2 is a section v of Tij2 over [formula]. We are looking for basis cocycles, i.e. cocycles such that their cohomology classes form a basis of [formula]. Note that if [formula] is holomorphic in U0 or U1 then the cohomology class of v is equal to 0. Obviously, any [formula] is a linear combination of vector fields ([\ref=loc_section_of_T^ij]) with holomorphic in [formula] coefficients. Further, we expand these coefficients in a Laurent series in x and drop the summands xn,  n  ≥  0, because they are holomorphic in U0. We see that v can be replaced by

[formula]

where [formula]. Using ([\ref=sootnoshen_v_peresech]), we see that the summands corresponding to n  ≥  ki + kj - 1 in the first sum of ([\ref=cocycle_chomological_to_v]) and the summands corresponding to n  ≥  ki + kj in the second sum of ([\ref=cocycle_chomological_to_v]) are holomorphic in U1. Further, it follows from ([\ref=sootnoshen_v_peresech]) that

[formula]

Hence the cohomology classes of the following cocycles

[formula]

generate [formula]. If we examine linear combination of these cocycles which are cohomological trivial, we get the result.[formula]

Remark. Note that a similar method can be used for computation of a basis of [formula] for any odd dimension m and any q.

In the case k1 = k2 = k3 = k, from Theorem [\ref=basis_of_H^1], it follows:

Assume that i < j and l  ≠  i,j.

[formula] For k  ≥  2 the basis of [formula] is

[formula]

[formula] If k < 2, we have [formula].

The group [formula]

This section is devoted to the calculation of the group of automorphisms [formula] of the vector bundle [formula] in the case (k,k,k). Here [formula] is the vector bundle corresponding to the split supermanifold (k,k,k).

Let (ξi) be a local basis of [formula] over U0 and A be an automorphism of [formula]. Assume that [formula]. In U1 we have

[formula]

Therefore, aij(x) is a polynomial in x of degree ≤  kj - ki, if kj - ki  ≥  0 and is 0, if kj - ki < 0. We denote by bij the entries of the matrix B = A- 1. The entries are also polynomials in x of degree ≤  kj - ki. We need the following formulas:

[formula]

where i  <  j, l  ≠  i,j and r  ≠  k,s. Here we use the notation [formula]. By ([\ref=A(vector_field)]), in the case k1 = k2 = k3 = k, we have:

Assume that k1 = k2 = k3 = k.

[formula] We have

[formula]

In other words

[formula]

[formula] The action of [formula] on T2 is given in U0 by the following formulas:

[formula]

where i  <  j, l  ≠  i,j and r  ≠  k,s. Here B  =  (bij)  =  A- 1

Classification of supermanifolds with retract (k,k,k)

In this section we give a classification up to isomorphism of complex-analytic supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] and with retract (k,k,k) using Theorem [\ref=Green_corollary]. In previous section we have calculated the vector space [formula], the group [formula] and the action [formula] of [formula] on [formula], see Theorem [\ref=basis_of_H^1_(k] [\ref=k] [\ref=k)] and Proposition [\ref=Aut_(k] [\ref=k] [\ref=k)]. Our objective in this section is to calculate the orbit space corresponding to the action [formula]:

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=Green_corollary] classes of isomorphic supermanifolds are in one-to-one correspondence with points of the set ([\ref=orbit_space]).

Let us fix the following basis of [formula]:

[formula]

[formula]

where p = 2k - 3, a = 2k - 1 and q = p + a = 4k - 4. (Compere with Theorem [\ref=basis_of_H^1_(k] [\ref=k] [\ref=k)].) Let us take [formula], see Proposition [\ref=Aut_(k] [\ref=k] [\ref=k)]. We get that in the basis ([\ref=basis1]) - ([\ref=basis2]) the automorphism [formula] is given by

[formula]

Note that for any matrix [formula] there exists a matrix B such that

[formula]

Indeed, we can put [formula]. We summarize these observations in the following proposition:

Assume that k1 = k2 = k3 = k. Then

[formula]

and the action [formula] of [formula] on [formula] is equivalent to the standard action of [formula] on [formula]. More precisely, [formula] is equivalent to the following action:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and DW is the usual matrix multiplication.

Now we prove our main result.

Let k  ≥  2. Complex-analytic supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] and retract (k,k,k) are in one-to-one correspondence with points of the following set:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Grassmannian of type (4k - 4,r), i.e. it is the set of all r-dimensional subspaces in [formula].

In the case k < 2 all supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] and retract (k,k,k) are split and isomorphic to their retract (k,k,k).

Proof. Assume that k  ≥  2. Clearly, the action ([\ref=action]) preserves the rank r of matrices from [formula] and r  ≤  3. Therefore, matrices with different rank belong to different orbits of this action. Furthermore, let us fix r∈{0,1,2,3}. Denote by [formula] all matrices with rank r. Clearly, we have

[formula]

A matrix [formula] defines the r-dimensional subspace VW in [formula]. This subspace is the linear combination of lines of W. (We consider lines of a matrix [formula] as vectors in [formula].) Therefore, we have defined the map Fr:

[formula]

The map Fr is surjective. Indeed, in any r-dimensional subspace [formula], where r  ≤  3, we can take 3 vectors generating V and form the matrix [formula]. In this case the matrix WV is of rank r and Fr(WV) = V. Clearly, Fr(W) = Fr(DW), where [formula]. Conversely, if W and W'∈F- 1r(VW), then there exists a matrix [formula] such that DW = W'. It follows that orbits of [formula] on [formula] are in one to one correspondence with points of [formula]. Therefore, orbits of [formula] on

[formula]

are in one-to-one correspondence with points of [formula]. The proof is complete.[formula]

Appendix. Classification of supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] of odd dimension 2.

In this Section we give a classification up to isomorphism of complex-analytic supermanifolds in the case m = 2 and [formula], where k1, k2 are any integers. As far as we know the classification in this case does not appear in the literature, but it is known for specialists.

Let us compute the 1-cohomology with values in the tangent sheaf T2. The sheaf T2 is a locally free sheaf of rank 1. Its basis section over (U0,OM|U0) is [formula] The transition functions in [formula] are given by the following formula:

[formula]

Therefore, a basis of [formula] is

[formula]

Let (ξi) be a local basis of [formula] over U0 and A be an automorphism of [formula]. As in the case m = 3, we have that aij(x) is a polynomial in x of degree ≤  kj - ki, if kj - ki  ≥  0 and is 0, if kj - ki < 0. We need the following formulas:

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

We see that the action [formula] is equivalent to the action of [formula] on [formula], therefore, the quotient space is [formula] for k1 + k2  ≥  4 and [formula] for k1 + k2 < 4. We have proven the following theorem:

Assume that k1 + k2  ≥  4. Complex-analytic supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] and retract (k1,k2) are in one-to-one correspondence with points of

[formula]

In the case k1 + k2 < 4 all supermanifolds with underlying space [formula] and retract (k1,k2) are split and isomorphic to their retract (k1,k2).
