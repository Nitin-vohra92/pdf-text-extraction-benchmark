Summary

Mean square estimate for relatively short exponential sums involving Fourier coefficients of cusp forms

Introduction

Let [formula] with e(x) = e2πix be a holomorphic cusp form of weight κ with respect to the full modular group. Estimating exponential sums involving Fourier coefficients of cusp forms is a classical question. For the so called long sums, the best possible bound is well-known: Jutila [\cite=jutila:ramanujan] has proved that

[formula]

when [formula]. This was an improvement over the classical result by Wilton [\cite=wilton]. By the Rankin-Selberg mean value theorem [\cite=rankin] this bound is the best possible in the general case, even though for some values of α it is possible to prove considerably better bounds. For instance, for rational values of [formula], the classical bound is ≪  k2 / 3M1 / 3 + ε

However, the behavior of short sums, i.e., the sums over an interval

[formula]

satisfying the conditions w(x)(j)  ≪  Δ- j for all non-negative [formula]. Further assume w(x) = 1 for M + Δ'  ≤  M + Δ  -  Δ' for some [formula] and w(x) = 0 for x  ≤  M and x  ≥  M + Δ. Now

[formula]

where

[formula]

Furthermore,

[formula]

We have to assume that 1  ≤  k  ≪  M1 / 2 - ε' for some positive ε'. If we let k�to be larger, then the error term in the truncated Voronoi type summation formula would be too large, i. e., we would not get a better average bound than the one obtained from Jutila's estimate for long sums [\cite=jutila:ramanujan] using the triangle inequality.

Notice that if we are only interested in the upper bound, we can easily deduce a result without the weight function, since by choosing the weight function [formula] to be a smooth weight function supported on the interval [formula], and obtaining value [formula] on [formula], we have

[formula]

and hence, noticing that the term ΔMεT1 / 2k is always smaller than the other terms, we obtain the following corollary:

Let 1 > δ  >  1 / 2, [formula], 0 < k  ≪  M1 / 2 - ε' for some fixed positive ε' and let h�and k�be co-prime. Let Δ  =   min (k2M1 / 2 + ε,M). Now

[formula]

Writing this corollary according to various values of k� we obtain the following bounds:

Let 1 > δ  >  1 / 2, [formula], 0 < k  ≪  M1 / 2 - ε' for some fixed positive ε' and let h�and k�be co-prime. Let Δ  =   min (k2M1 / 2 + ε,M). Now

[formula]

The main advantage in this theorem is the relatively short averaging interval compared to the length of the sum, when the value of k�is small. The averaging interval is actually similar to the one in [\cite=oma:mean]. However, in the current paper, the length of the sum can be much longer than the averaging interval unlike there. In particular, we obtain the following corollary:

We have

[formula]

where Δ  ≫  M1 / 2 + ε', and where ε > 0 and ε' > 0 can be chosen to be arbitrarily small fixed positive numbers.

This corollary shows that already on a short averaging interval the average behavior of a nearly long sum (i. e., a sum of length x1 - ε) has the conjectured size x1 / 4 + ε in average.

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=paatulos], we need some lemmas, which will be presented in the following section. In the final section, we will have the proof of Theorem [\ref=paatulos].

In the following, the ε's will be positive, not necessarily equal. The constants implied by symbols ≪  ,  ≫   and O() do not depend on M or k, but they do depend on ε, δ, on the properties of the weight function, etc.

Lemmas

The first lemma is partial integration (see e.g. [\cite=jutimoto:acta] Lemma 6):

Let A be a P  ≥  0 times differentiable function which is compactly supported in a finite interval

[formula]

, and regular throughout the complex domain composed of all points within the distance ϱ from the interval; and assume that there exists a quantity B1 such that

[formula]

for any point x in the domain. Then we have

[formula]

The following lemmas can be proved using partial integration or the previous lemma. The details are similar to those in [\cite=oma:mean].

Let 1  ≤  m,n  ≤  M. Then

[formula]

where T1(x) and T2(x) are x or x + T (not necessarily but possibly the same).

Let 1  ≤  m,n  ≤  M.Then

[formula]

where T(x) = x or T(x) = x + T.

Let 1  ≤  m,n  ≤  M.Then

[formula]

When [formula] for some x∈[M,M  +  Δ], Lemma [\ref=hankalin] does not give any information.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=paatulos]

Using a Voronoi-type summation formula (see [\cite=jutila:lectures] Theorem 1.2 with [formula] and the choice N = M, we have

[formula]

Squaring and integration over the error term gives a total contribution of at most

[formula]

We may thus forget it for awhile because the contribution from the cross-terms between the error term and the other terms can be taken into account using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Denote

[formula]

Hence, the expression we need to consider is

[formula]

Let us first split the summation at M':

[formula]

and choose M' in the following way:

[formula]

Notice that if Δ = M, then Δ  ≫  T, and if Δ = M1 / 2 + εk2, then the condition Δ  ≫  T is equivalent to M1 / 2 + εk2  ≫  T, so k  ≫  T1 / 2M- 1 / 4 - ε. Let us concentrate on treating the first two terms, and then use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to estimate the last term. Let us start with the second term. We have

[formula]

Let us treat the second term as the first one can be treated similarly. We have

[formula]

The terms with m = n yield a total contribution

[formula]

When T  ≫  Δ, we have M' = M2T- 2 and hence

[formula]

When T  ≪  Δ, we have M' = M2T- 1Δ- 1, and hence

[formula]

When m  ≠  n, we need to estimate integrals

[formula]

and

[formula]

We only consider the first one as the second one is similar but simpler. We use Lemma [\ref=erimerkki] to bound the integral. We obtain

[formula]

The sum over these estimates can be made as small as desired if

[formula]

This is the case for all except [formula] values around each n (as long as n�is sufficiently large such that there are values m  ≠  n in this neighborhood, which is the case when [formula]). Let us use absolute values in these cases to bound the integral, and sum over these values:

[formula]

We have now derived the total contribution from the terms with m,n  ≫  M' and the error term in the Voronoi summation formula to be ≪  k2M1 + ε + kΔMεT1 / 2.

Let us now move to considering the part

[formula]

This part is technically somewhat more challenging because it is not sufficient to just use the triangle inequality, but we need to get some cancellation on the diagonal terms. Therefore, we will also meet some integrals that are more difficult to consider than the integrals treated in the first part of the proof.

We have

[formula]

Thus, we have

[formula]

Let us first treat the error term and then concentrate on the main term. Squaring and integrating over the main term gives the total contribution

[formula]

If T  ≫  Δ, we have M' = M2T- 2, and hence

[formula]

If Δ  ≫  T, we have M' = M2T- 1Δ- 1, and hence

[formula]

In both cases, the contribution coming from the error term is at most kΔMεT1 / 2. Let us now move to the main term.

[formula]

Let us first look at the case with n = m. Now

[formula]

When [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence, if [formula], and since by our choice of M', we always have [formula], we can split the diagonal sum into two. The first part gives the bound

[formula]

The second part gives the bound

[formula]

On the other hand, if [formula], we have

[formula]

We can now move to the terms with n  ≠  m. We split the cosine product into exponential terms, and thus, we have to treat integrals of the type

[formula]

where T1(x) and T2(x) are x or x + T, possibly but not necessarily the same. These integrals have been treated in Lemmas [\ref=erifunktiot]-[\ref=hankalin]. Lemma [\ref=erifunktiot] always gives a good enough bound. Lemma [\ref=erimerkki] gives a good enough bound, namely, the integral can be made as small as desired, unless [formula]. As in the first part of the proof, there are [formula] values of m�around each n for which [formula]. The contribution coming from these terms is again

[formula]

We may now move to the cases when using Lemma [\ref=hankalin] fails. Notice first that writing

[formula]

we have

[formula]

when [formula] for some y∈[M,M  +  Δ]. Next we want to show that when n�lies outside the interval [formula] for [formula], then

[formula]

for some ε', which is just enough that we can use partial integration Lemma [\ref=jutilamotohashi] (and therefore, Lemma [\ref=hankalin]) to estimate the integral. Write now

[formula]

Then

[formula]

We can show a similar estimate for [formula]. Notice that when [formula], this interval contains at most a constant number of terms. Furthermore, by our choice of M', there is at most one n�for each m satisfying the condition [formula] for some y∈[M,M  +  Δ], since the length of the interval [formula] is

[formula]

All the integers on the interval [formula] are greater than m. When the distance mTM- 1 between the largest number on the interval and m is at most o(1), there cannot be any numbers on the interval. This is the case when m = o(MT- 1).

In particular, when both [formula] and m = o(MT- 1), the sum is empty. Therefore, it suffices to estimate the sums [formula] and m  ≫  MT- 1. We will just take absolute values of the integrals. The contribution coming from interval [formula] is

[formula]

The contribution coming from interval Im is

[formula]

We have now derived the contribution from the terms m,n  ≪  M' to be the contribution from the main term and an error of size at most ≪  k2M1 + ε + kΔMεT1 / 2. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality completes the proof.
