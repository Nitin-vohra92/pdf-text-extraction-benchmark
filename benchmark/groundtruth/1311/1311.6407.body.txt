Gadolinium in Water Cherenkov Detectors Improves Detection of Supernova νe

Introduction

Supernovae are one of the most spectacular electromagnetic displays in the Universe. Understanding them is essential for many areas of physics and astrophysics. Core-collapse supernovae are massive stars ([formula]) that, at the end of their burning cycles, collapse under gravity to form a neutron star or black hole [\cite=Janka:1995bx] [\cite=Langanke:2002ab] [\cite=Mezzacappa:2005ju] [\cite=Burrows:2006ci] [\cite=Janka:2006fh] [\cite=Woosley:2006ie] [\cite=Burrows:2012ew] [\cite=Janka:2012wk]. These collapses are potential sites for gravitational-wave production [\cite=Ott:2008wt] [\cite=Kotake:2011yv] [\cite=Ando:2012hna], gamma-ray bursts [\cite=Woosley:2006fn], heavy-element nucleosynthesis [\cite=Thielemann:2001rn] [\cite=Woosley:2007as], and cosmic-ray acceleration [\cite=Blasi:2010gr].

It is difficult to learn about the core properties and collapse mechanism using electromagnetic light curves, as the surface of last scattering of photons is in the outer envelope. Neutrinos, on the other hand, being weakly interacting, have their surface of last scattering much deeper inside, within the core. Neutrinos carry about ~  99% of the binding energy released during the collapse of the star. Precise measurements of all flavors of neutrinos can provide much information about a supernova [\cite=Thompson:2002mw] [\cite=Tomas:2004gr] [\cite=Dasgupta:2005wn] [\cite=Friedland:2006ta] [\cite=Lunardini:2007vn] [\cite=Suwa:2008sf] [\cite=Marek:2008qi] [\cite=Huedepohl:2009wh] [\cite=Kneller:2010sc] [\cite=Muller:2011yi] [\cite=Kistler:2012as] [\cite=Lund:2012vm] [\cite=Wongwathanarat:2012zp] [\cite=Scholberg:2012id] [\cite=Tamborra:2013laa] [\cite=Nakamura:2012nc] [\cite=Kneller:2013baa] [\cite=Kneller:2013ska] [\cite=Borriello:2013tha].

The only supernova neutrinos ever detected were from SN 1987A [\cite=Hirata:1987hu] [\cite=Bionta:1987qt]. Even this modest data has been invaluable for understanding neutrinos and supernovae. Only e were detected, through the inverse beta channel, e  +  p  →  e+  +  n, leading to, e.g., constraints on the total and average energy in this flavor [\cite=Jegerlehner:1996kx] [\cite=Lunardini:2004bj] [\cite=Yuksel:2007mn] [\cite=Pagliaroli:2008ur]. (We assume that the first event was not due to neutrino-electron elastic scattering, which has a very small probability.)

Computer simulations of supernova explosions have detailed predictions about the neutrino emission, but, due to the lack of a high-statistics Galactic supernova, it is not possible to adequately test these [\cite=Mueller:2010nf] [\cite=Brandt:2010xa] [\cite=Mueller:2012ak] [\cite=O'Connor:2012am] [\cite=Kotake:2012iv] [\cite=Ott:2012kr] [\cite=Kotake:2012nd] [\cite=Mueller:2012is] [\cite=Bruenn:2012mj]. It is important to detect all flavors of neutrinos to measure the total and average energy in each. Because the differences between flavors may be modest, large numbers of events must be detected to ensure adequate precision.

Galactic supernovae occur only once every ~  30 years. It is essential that a variety of detectors be ready to detect all flavors of neutrinos well to understand the physics and astrophysics of core-collapse supernovae. Using present detectors, it will be easy to measure supernova e and νx, via inverse beta and elastic scattering on protons, respectively [\cite=Vogel:1999zy] [\cite=Strumia:2003zx] [\cite=Beacom:2002hs] [\cite=Dasgupta:2011wg]. Unless very large liquid argon [\cite=Raghavan:1986hv] [\cite=GilBotella:2004bv] or liquid scintillator detectors [\cite=Wurm:2011zn] [\cite=Li:2013zyd] are built, or other techniques become experimentally viable [\cite=Haxton:1987bf] [\cite=Fuller:1998kb] [\cite=Haxton:1998vj] [\cite=Ianni:2005ki] [\cite=Lazauskas:2009yh] [\cite=Suzuki:2012aa], there is presently no way to guarantee the clean detection of supernova νe in adequate numbers. The difficulties of measuring the νe spectrum well enough have long been known; e.g., see Refs. [\cite=Haxton:1987kc] [\cite=Minakata:1989mk] [\cite=Qian:1993hh] [\cite=Lunardini:2001pb] [\cite=Lunardini:2003eh] [\cite=Beacom:2005it] [\cite=Skadhauge:2006su] [\cite=Skadhauge:2008gf].

Here we show how this problem could be solved by using gadolinium (Gd) in Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) and other large water Cherenkov detectors. The addition of Gd to Super-K was proposed to improve the detection of e. Ironically, this would also improve the detection of νe. We add new ideas to those briefly noted in Ref. [\cite=Beacom:2003nk] and perform the first detailed calculations, showing how supernova νe could be measured precisely.

The principal technique is to use neutrino-electron scattering, νe  +  e-  →  νe  +  e-. These events are forward-peaked, so a narrow cone contains the majority of them. The largest background is from inverse beta events. The use of Gd to detect neutrons will help in individually detecting and removing these events with high efficiency. The spectrum of e will be measured precisely so that the remaining inverse beta and e  +  e- scattering events can be statistically subtracted from the forward cone. Liquid scintillator detectors can detect νx (= νμ  +  ντ) well enough through ν  +  p  →  ν  +  p scattering, so the νx  +  e- scattering events can be statistically subtracted.

In addition, we show how gadolinium will improve the prospects for measuring νe charged-current interactions with oxygen. This channel is only important if the average energy of νe is large, either intrinsically, or due to efficient mixing with sufficiently hot νx. Recent supernova simulations suggest that none of the flavors has a large average energy, and that the differences between flavors are modest, so that these interactions with oxygen may not be important. In contrast, the neutrino-electron scattering events would be measured well in all scenarios if Gd is used to reduce backgrounds.

Detecting supernova νe will be helpful in constructing the initial spectrum of these neutrinos, testing neutrino mixing scenarios, and probing exotic physics. We concentrate on detecting the νe emitted during the full duration of the burst; however, this technique could also help in detecting the short neutronization burst νe in Mton water Cherenkov detectors [\cite=Kachelriess:2004ds].

The outline for this article is as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:Neutrino_spectra_and_Gd], we discuss the various theoretical and experimental inputs required to isolate supernova νe. In Sec. [\ref=sec:SN_nue_detection], we discuss how this can constrain the νe spectrum parameters, and we conclude in Sec. [\ref=sec:conclusion].

Calculation inputs

We first discuss the neutrino spectra from a supernova, followed by the various detection channels in a water Cherenkov detector. We then outline the detection strategy that we propose to use to detect supernova νe in a water Cherenkov detector with gadolinium.

Supernova Neutrino Spectra

A supernova neutrino burst lasts for ~   10 sec and includes all flavors of neutrinos. The total binding energy released in the explosion is ~  3  ×  1053 erg. We assume that the total energy is equipartitioned between the 6 species so that the total energy carried by each ν (or [formula]) flavor is ~  5  ×  1052 erg. The supernova is assumed to be at a distance of 10 kpc, the median distance of core collapse progenitor stars in our Galaxy, which is slightly farther than the distance to the Galactic Center [\cite=Adams:2013ana].

Supernova neutrinos are emitted in a quasi-thermal distribution. For concreteness, we take a particular modified Maxwell-Boltzmann spectrum [\cite=Keil:2002in] [\cite=Tamborra:2012ac],

[formula]

where this is normalized to unity. Using a regular Maxwell-Boltzmann or a Fermi-Dirac spectrum with the same average energy gives more neutrinos at high energies. For the electron-scattering and inverse-beta channels, the increased number of events is [formula] 5%. For the oxygen channel, which depends very sensitively on neutrino energy, the number of events can increase by ~   50%. Our choice of spectrum is conservative and our results can only improve if other neutrino spectra are appropriate.

For the average energies of the initial spectra, we take 〈Eνe〉  ≈   11 - 12 MeV, 〈Ee〉  ≈   14 - 15 MeV, and 〈Eνx〉  ≈   15 - 18 MeV; the hierarchy follows from the different strengths of interaction in the supernova core. Neutrino mixing effects in the supernova [\cite=Dighe:1999bi] [\cite=Dighe:2008dq] [\cite=Dasgupta:2009mg] [\cite=Dasgupta:2010gr] [\cite=Duan:2010bg] [\cite=Duan:2010af] [\cite=Friedland:2010sc] [\cite=Pehlivan:2011hp] [\cite=Sarikas:2011am] [\cite=Cherry:2012zw] or in Earth [\cite=Lunardini:2001pb] [\cite=Dighe:2003jg] [\cite=Dighe:2003vm] can have a dramatic effect on the final spectra, even exchanging them. Then the νe (or e) spectrum could have an average energy of ~   15 - 18 MeV, increasing the yields of charged-current detection channels. (The yields of neutral-current detection channels do not change for active-flavor mixing.) To tell how efficient the mixing is, we need to measure the νe detection spectra precisely.

A model independent neutrino signal from a supernova is the neutronization burst, which consists of a short pulse (~   25 msec) of initially pure νe before the ~   10 sec emission of neutrinos of all flavors [\cite=Kachelriess:2004ds]. Depending on the neutrino mixing scenario, the number of neutronization νe detected in a Mton water Cherenkov detector for a Galactic supernova is ~   30 - 100 [\cite=Kachelriess:2004ds] [\cite=Cherry:2013mv]. Our detection strategy will also be useful in this case. In Super-Kamiokande (fiducial volume 32 kton), the number of events due to neutronisation νe is only ~   O(1).

Neutrino Detection Interactions

All flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos can be detected with the ν  +  e-  →  ν  +  e- channel. The recoil kinetic energy of the scattered electron varies between 0 and 2E2ν / (me + 2Eν). The forward-scattered electron makes an angle α with the incoming neutrino given by cos [formula], where Te is the kinetic energy of the recoil electron.

The differential cross section for neutrino-electron elastic scattering is [\cite=Vogel:1989iv]

[formula]

where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, gV = 2 sin2θW  ±  1 / 2 for νe and νx, respectively, and gA  =    ±  1 / 2 for νe and νx, respectively. For anti-neutrinos, gA  →   - gA. When integrated over Te, the total cross section [formula].

Only e were detected from SN 1987A, via the inverse beta reaction, e  +  p  →  e+  +  n, where p denotes free hydrogen (protons) in water and the positrons are emitted almost isotropically. The cross section for this process is σ(Eν)≃0.0952  ×  10- 42(Eν - 1.3)2(1  -  7Eν / mp) cm2 where mp is the proton mass, the energies are in MeV, the threshold of the reaction is Eν  >  1.8 MeV, and Te≃Eν  -  1.8 MeV [\cite=Vogel:1999zy] [\cite=Strumia:2003zx].

The neutron thermalizes by elastic collisions and is captured on protons as n  +  p  →  d  +  γ in about 200 μs. The emitted gamma ray has an energy of 2.2 MeV, which cannot be reliably detected in Super-K due to low-energy detector backgrounds [\cite=Zhang:2013tua]. To unambiguously detect the emitted neutron, it has been proposed to add Gd to large water Cherenkov detectors. Then the neutron will be thermalized and captured on Gd in about 20 μs, leading to a 3 - 4 gamma rays with a total energy of about 8 MeV, which is easily detectable in Super-K [\cite=Beacom:2003nk].

Electron neutrinos can also be detected in water Cherenkov detectors by νe  +  16O →  e-  +  16F* [\cite=Haxton:1987kc], where most of the final-state decay products of the excited 16F* nucleus are not detectable. The threshold for this reaction is ≈   15 MeV, and the electron kinetic energy is Te  ≈  Eν - 15 MeV. In the energy range 25  MeV  ≤  Eν  ≤  100 MeV, the cross-section is given by σ(Eν)  ≈  4.7  ×  10- 40(E0.25ν - 150.25)6 cm2, for energies in MeV [\cite=Haxton:1987kc] [\cite=Tomas:2003xn]. The angular distribution of the electrons is slightly backward tilted. The steep energy dependence of the cross section means that νe can only be detected well if the average energy is large, say due to mixing.

We neglect other neutrino interactions with oxygen (e charged-current [\cite=Haxton:1987kc] and all-flavor neutral-current [\cite=Langanke:1995he]), as they are not our focus and their yields are small compared to that from the inverse beta channel.

The time-integrated flux for single neutrino flavor is

[formula]

where Etotν denotes the total energy in that ν flavor and d is the distance to the supernova. The observed event spectrum in the detector is

[formula]

where NT is the appropriate number of targets. For a larger average energy, the thermally-averaged cross section is larger, but the flux is smaller (because the total energy is taken to be fixed). For neutrino-electron scattering, these effects nearly cancel, making the total number of events almost insensitive to the average energy. The shape of the electron recoil spectrum does change, which provides sensitivity to the average energy.

Table [\ref=tab:yields] shows the expected number of events in Super-K for these reactions under different assumptions about the neutrino average energy. For additional details about the detection of neutrinos from a Galactic supernova in water Cherenkov detectors, see the references already cited as well as Refs. [\cite=Beacom:1998ya] [\cite=Beacom:1998yb] [\cite=Ikeda:2007sa].

Proposed Detection Strategy

We focus on Super-K, the largest detector with low intrinsic backgrounds [\cite=Abe:2010hy]. We assume that supernova events can be detected in the full inner volume of 32 kton. Super-K measures the energy, position, and direction of charged particles with very high efficiency. During a burst, detector backgrounds can be ignored. There is extensive ongoing research on employing Gd in Super-K [\cite=Beacom:2003nk] [\cite=Watanabe:2008ru] [\cite=Vagins:2012vta]. The efficiency of neutron capture on Gd will be known from calibration data.

We employ the νe  +  e-  →  νe  +  e- reaction to detect the νe and look for the forward-scattered electrons. Knowing the direction of the Galactic supernova, if we make an angular cut of half-angle 40[formula] (appropriate for the lowest energy νe  +  e- events [\cite=Abe:2010hy]), then ~   68% of the electron-scattering events will be in that cone. The forward-scattered electrons can also locate the supernova to within a few degrees [\cite=Beacom:1998fj] [\cite=Tomas:2003xn] [\cite=Antonioli:2004zb] [\cite=Adams:2013ana].

Fig. [\ref=fig:nu_-_e_event_spectrum] shows the recoil spectra for neutrino-electron scattering for all flavors. (We use kinetic energy, but Super-Kamiokande conventionally uses the total energy, Ee  =  Te  +  me). Because the energy range is so broad, the effects of energy resolution smearing (~  15% near 10 MeV) were found to be modest, and are not included. As can be seen from the figure, νe has the largest number of events. This is important, because the other flavors of neutrino-electron scattering events are an irreducible background to the νe  +  e- events.

The largest number of events will be due to the inverse beta reaction, which is almost isotropic. Neutron detection on Gd will individually identify ~   90% of these events. The very large number of events will determine the e parameters precisely (~  1% with ~  104 events), which will be used to statistically subtract the remaining inverse beta events. Events from other detection channels can also be statistically subtracted.

Supernova νe detection and constraints

We first discuss the typically-assumed range of supernova neutrino spectrum parameters and show spectra for some representative neutrino mixing scenarios. We then calculate fits for the neutrino spectrum parameters and show the results for these and other cases.

Calculated Detection Spectra

Several cases can be considered for the initial spectra and how they are changed by neutrino mixing. Our focus is on testing the νe sector. We first note the two extreme cases that we want to differentiate and then mention some other possibilities. There are also cases intermediate between the extremes we note. We do not try to identify these cases in terms of active-flavor neutrino mixing scenarios, given the large uncertainties in the problem, especially in the initial neutrino spectra. Our focus on improving the measurements, and the interpretation in terms of supernova emission and neutrino mixing will come once there is a detection.

Case (A) has 〈Eνe〉  ≈  12 MeV and 〈Eνx〉  ≈   15 - 18 MeV, i.e., there is a hierarchy of average energies between the flavors initially and neutrino mixing has not interchanged them (other assumptions are as above).

Case (B) has 〈Eνe〉  ≈   15 - 18 MeV and one flavor of νx has 〈Eνx〉  ≈  12 MeV (the other flavors of νx have 〈Eνx〉  ≈   15 - 18 MeV), i.e., there is a hierarchy of average energies between the flavors initially and neutrino mixing has interchanged them.

If the average energy of νx were large and mixing was effective at exchanging the spectra of antineutrinos instead of neutrinos, this would be evident in the e  +  p spectrum; this is disfavored by the SN 1987A data. If all flavors had a low average energy, this would be evident in the e  +  p and ν  +  p spectra (because the ν  +  p channel is a neutral-current interaction, its yield is not changed by active-flavor mixing). The yields of these and other channels can decide everything except the differences between Cases (A) and (B). That's the open problem: What is the νe spectrum?

When the νe average energy is high, νe  +  16O is a good detection channel; otherwise, it gives no useful signal because the yields are too small to be detected in the presence of backgrounds. Typical average energies from supernova simulations are markedly lower than the values assumed a decade or two ago, so νe  +  16O is now a much less favorable channel. Besides νe  +  e- in Super-K, there is no other detection channel in any existing detector that produces enough identifiable νe events when the average energy is low. The yield of νe  +  e- barely changes with changes in the average energy. Another important change from a decade or two ago is that much lower energies can be detected, which improves the spectrum shape tests.

The main background for these reactions is the inverse beta events. Some of these numerous events can be removed using an angular cut, but they still pose a formidable background. This is shown in the left panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:IB] for the same average energies as in Fig. [\ref=fig:nu_-_e_event_spectrum]. There are ~   128 νe  +  e- events in the 40[formula] cone, but this is swamped by ~  827 inverse beta events. In the absence of neutron tagging, it will be difficult to extract the νe signal from this background.

However, adding Gd to Super-K has a dramatic effect. Assuming that the efficiency of neutron detection in a Gd-loaded Super-K is 90%, the inverse beta background will decrease to 83 events. This strongly improves the detection prospects of νe. The e spectrum will be well measured by cleanly-identified inverse beta decay events using neutron detection by Gd. This will allow statistical subtraction of the backgrounds due to e  +  e- and the remaining e  +  p events. Liquid scintillator detectors will measure the spectrum of νx from the ν  +  p channel, which is most sensitive to the flavors with the highest average energies. This will allow statistical subtraction of the backgrounds due to the νx  +  e- channel. These subtractions only lead to modest increases in the uncertainties of the spectrum shown in the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:IB].

The νe  +  16O channel is only useful if the νe average energy is large, as otherwise the yield is too small. Even for a νe average energy of 18 MeV, the backgrounds are still important. There are ~  200 signal events in the whole detector. Excluding a forward cone of 25[formula], ~  190 events remain. (The different choice of angle for the forward cone is because now we focus on higher energies, for which the angular resolution is better.) In a detector without Gd, these would be overwhelmed by the ~   7071 inverse beta events, but neutron tagging by Gd will dramatically reduce this background. This situation is shown in the right panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:IB]. Again assuming an efficiency of 90% in neutron tagging in a Gd-loaded Super-K, only ~   707 of the inverse beta events will remain. This enormous reduction in background will greatly help in isolating the νe  +  16O signal.

Fig. [\ref=fig:different_average_energies] shows how the detection spectra for νe  +  e- and νe  +  16O change with different assumptions about the νe average energy. The yield for νe  +  e- elastic scattering depends only weakly on the average energy but that for νe  +  16O reaction changes dramatically. See also Table [\ref=tab:yields]. Both channels also have characteristic spectrum changes as the average energy changes, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:different_average_energies].

Fits for Neutrino Spectrum Parameters

The detection spectra in Fig. [\ref=fig:IB] show that adding Gd to Super-K will greatly reduce backgrounds for supernova νe. We quantify the improvement in the determination of the νe spectrum parameters, 〈Eνe〉 and Etotνe, by constructing a χ2 and performing fits. We use

[formula]

where Oi(〈Eνe〉0,Etot,0νe) are the numbers of events in each bin assuming the fiducial values of the parameters, Ti(〈Eνe〉,Etotνe) are the same allowing different values, and σi are the uncertainties on the fiducial numbers.

Because all spectra except νe will be well measured separately, here we only need to fit for the νe spectrum parameters. That is, we fit spectra like those in Fig. [\ref=fig:different_average_energies] after the remaining backgrounds shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:IB] have been statistically subtracted. In the χ2 calculation, the numbers of events in the numerator are only those of the signals; the backgrounds affect the results by increasing the uncertainties in the denominator, which depend on the numbers of signal plus background events.

Put another way, if we set up a χ2 for the data before the statistical subtractions (Fig. [\ref=fig:IB] instead Fig. [\ref=fig:different_average_energies]), then the contributions from flavors besides νe would cancel in the numerator but not the denominator. More precisely, those cancelations would occur only on average if typical statistical fluctuations were included.

To determine the allowed regions of parameters when a supernova is detected, we calculate Δχ2 relative to various assumed best-fit cases (using Δχ2  =  4.6 for two degrees of freedom to obtain the 90% C.L. regions).

Our results indicate the likely size and shape of the allowed regions once a supernova is detected. We make some reasonable approximations. The uncertainties on the initial spectra and the effects of neutrino mixing are large, and the uncertainties on the neutrino cross sections are moderate. In addition, we are considering only the time-averaged emission, whereas the average energies may vary during the burst. The widths of the bins were chosen to have approximately equal numbers of νe  +  e- events in each bin (at least ≃10 events per bin). The numbers of events are then large enough that the Poisson uncertainties can be treated as Gaussian.

In Case (A) from above, there is a hierarchy between the average energies of different flavors, but their spectra are not interchanged by mixing, so the average energy of νe is low. We take 〈Eνe〉0 = 12 MeV and Etot,0νe  =  5  ×  1052 erg as fiducial parameters for this case.

If these are the true parameters of the supernova, then the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:chisquared] shows the likely precision with which the parameters would be reconstructed from the measured data in Super-K without or with Gd. In this case, the primary constraint comes from the νe  +  e- channel. The νe  +  16O channel does not have enough events relative to the backgrounds, though large values of 〈Eνe〉 can be excluded by the non-observation of a significant number of events. The presence of Gd reduces the size of the allowed region significantly. With both channels together, the allowed region would be centered on 〈Eνe〉  =  12 MeV and would range from roughly 9 to 14 MeV. Thus, with Gd, it would be possible to say that 〈Eνe〉 is different from 〈Ee〉 (which could be 15 MeV with ~  1% precision). This would not be possible without Gd, so this is an important difference.

In Case (B) from above, there is a hierarchy between the average energies of different flavors, and their spectra are interchanged by mixing, so the average energy of νe is high. We take 〈Eνe〉0 = 18 MeV and Etot,0νe  =  5  ×  1052 erg as fiducial parameters for this case.

If these are the true parameters of the supernova, then the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:chisquared] shows the likely precision with which the parameters would be reconstructed from the measured data in Super-K without or with Gd. In this case, both channels have enough events to define allowed regions. The steep energy dependence of the νe  +  16O cross section gives a precise measurement of the average energy, though the large backgrounds and uncertainties mean that the total energy is not well determined. As before, the presence of Gd improves the precision, especially for the νe  +  e- channel. With both channels together, the allowed region would be very small. It would be easy to distinguish Case (A) and Case (B); Gd would greatly improve the significance of this comparison.

The presence of Gd is even more important when the neutrino average energies are closer to each other. This is seen in some simulations, e.g., Ref. [\cite=Mueller:2012ak], where 〈Eνe〉  ≈   11 MeV, and 〈Ee〉  ≈  〈Eνx〉  ≈   15 MeV. Due to the less pronounced hierarchy, it will be much harder to distinguish scenarios like Case (A) and Case (B).

Fig. [\ref=fig:jointchisquared] shows our results (joint constraints using both channels) for the allowed regions of the νe spectrum parameters. In this case, the presence of Gd does not completely separate the 90% C.L. contours, but it comes very close. Without Gd, the two allowed regions cannot be separated at all, which would significantly degrade the ability to test the physics.

Recent long-term simulations show that the average energy of the neutrinos can change during the ~   10 sec emission time [\cite=Huedepohl:2009wh] [\cite=Fischer:2011cy] [\cite=Nakazato:2012qf]. The average energy of νe typically changes from ~   12 MeV to ~   6 MeV. For a detector like Super-Kamiokande, it might be difficult to detect this change of average energy. For a future detector like Hyper-Kamiokande, which will have better precision the spectral properties (see later), such a difference could distinguished.

Conclusions

When the next Galactic supernova occurs, it is essential that we have a collection of detectors that can measure all neutrino flavors well. Without this, we will be unable to fully address many important questions. What is the total energy emitted in neutrinos and how is it partitioned among flavors? Are the average energies of the various flavors different? What do these results say about neutrino mixing and tests of exotic physics? What do the differences between e and νe emission tell us about the neutron-to-proton ratio of the collapsing core?

At present, the only detector with a relatively large yield of νe events is Super-K. Even so, this is only ~  102 events using the νe  +  e- channel. If the average energy of νe is large enough, then the νe  +  16O channel will have a comparable number of events. The problem is the background of ~  104 events from the inverse beta channel, e  +  p. This background can be reduced for νe  +  e- using an angular cut, but not enough.

We demonstrate in detail a new technique to reduce backgrounds for both the νe  +  e- and νe  +  16O channels. If Super-K adds Gd to improve the detection of e  +  p, then ~  90% of these events will be individually identified through detection of the neutron radiative capture on Gd in close time and space coincidence with the positron. This would dramatically reduce backgrounds for other channels. The remaining backgrounds can be statistically subtracted using independent measurements.

We show that the νe spectrum parameters, 〈Eνe〉 (average energy) and Etotνe (total energy), can be measured to ~  20% or better if Super-K adds Gd. This is a significant improvement over the capabilities of Super-K without Gd. (For comparison, the precision for νx in existing scintillator detectors is comparable, and the precision for e in Super-K will be ~  1%.) Further, this improvement could be the difference between being able to answer essential questions or not. Unless very large liquid argon or liquid scintillator detectors are built, then we have no other way to adequately measure the νe spectrum.

Future extremely large water Cherenkov detectors like Hyper-Kamiokande would have a dramatic impact on detecting supernova νe using this technique. The ~  25 times larger volume would reduce the uncertainty on the νe parameters by factor of [formula]. This requires using Gd in Hyper-Kamiokande, the prospects of which are prominently considered [\cite=Kearns:2013lea]. (This would also require a new very large liquid scintillator detector [\cite=Wurm:2011zn] [\cite=Li:2013zyd] to for improved measurements of νx using the ν  +  p channel.)

This new method of determining supernova νe would help improve our understanding of supernovae and neutrinos in many ways. It provides yet another motivation for Super-K to add Gd. Given how infrequent Galactic supernovae are, it is essential that the opportunity to measure νe well not be missed.
