Suzaku View of the Neutron Star in the Dipping Source 4U 1822-  37

Introduction

Most of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), namely X-ray emitting binaries with Roche-lobe filling low mass stars, are considered to involve neutron stars (NSs) with low magnetic field strengths, B <  1010 G. They make a contrast to high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), mostly containing NSs with high magnetic field strengths (B ~  1012 G) which capture stellar winds from their companions. In fact, among ~  50 known LMXBs, only three are known to have NSs with strong magnetic fields; Her X-1, 4U 1626-  67 and GX 1+4 [\citep=1989PASJ...41....1N]. These distinct combinations of the mass-donating and mass accreting components may be generally interpreted as population effects, that older NSs have weaker fields. However, it is not necessarily clear whether NSs gradually lose their magnetic fields (e.g., [\cite=1992ARA&A..30..143C]). Then, it is worth while searching for other LMXBs that involve NSs with strong magnetic fields.

Evidently, the magnetic field affects accretion mechanisms in binaries. When the NS has strong magnetic fields, the accreting matter is funneled onto the two magnetic poles, leading to strong pulsations, and the production of very hard X-ray spectra which is often accompanied by cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs; [\cite=1999ApJ...525..978M]). If, in contrast, the NS is weakly magnetized, an accretion disk is considered to extend down to vicinity of the NS, and the emergent X-ray spectra will exhibit characteristic bimodel behavior between so-called soft state and hard state (e.g. [\cite=2007ApJ...667.1073L] [\cite=2012PASJ...64...72S]). These spectral properties, together with the presence/absence of X-ray pulsations, will conversely allow us to tell whether the NS in a mass exchanging binary is strongly or weakly magnetized.

In an attempt of looking for LMXBs that involve strongly magnetized NSs, the present paper focuses on the dipping X-ray binary 4U 1822-37, located at an estimated distance of 2.5 kpc [\citep=1982MNRAS.200..793M] [\citep=2003AJ....125.2163C]. The companion star in 4U 1822-  37 is estimated to have a mass of 0.44 - 0.56 M[formula] [\citep=2005ApJ...635..502M], with [formula] being the Solar mass, and hence this system is clarified as an LMXB. X-ray and optical light curves of this source both show intensity modulations and dips synchronize with its orbital period, Porb ~   5.7 hr [\citep=1982MNRAS.200..793M] [\citep=2010A&A...515A..44B]. These effects are attributed to either gradual occultation (by the companion star) of a large X-ray scattering corona above the accretion disk (e.g., [\cite=2001ApJ...557...24I]), or variable attenuation of direct X-rays from the NS by ionized humps on the disk (e.g., [\cite=2006A&A...445..179D]). From dip properties, the orbital inclination is constrained between 76[formula] and 84[formula] [\citep=1989MNRAS.239..715H] [\citep=2001MNRAS.320..249H].

Although 4U 1822-  37 is classified as an LMXB, its X-ray properties appear rather different from those of other dipping LMXBs. First, it shows clear X-ray pulsations with a period of Ps = 0.5924 s which is much longer than those of other typical LMXBs, a few milliseconds [\citep=2004NuPhS.132..496W] if ever detected. Figure [\ref=corbet_diagram] is so-called Corbet diagram ([\cite=1984A&A...141...91C]), which displays neutron-star binaries on a plane of orbital period and rotation period. Like 4U 1626-  67 and Her X-1, 4U 1822- 37 is thus located on this plot between typical LMXBs and HMXBs. Combining the estimated X-ray luminosity (1036 - 38 erg s- 1) with Ps and its change rate, [formula] = - 2.85  ×  10- 12 s s- 1, the magnetic field strength of the NS in this source was actually estimated as B = 108 - 16 G ([\cite=2001ApJ...553L..43J]). Although the error is very large, it is noteworthy that rather high field strength are allowed.

Second, this object exhibits much harder spectra together with a lower cutoff energy than typical LMXBs in the hard state. From the measured cutoff energy (~   6 keV), [\citet=2000A&A...356..175P] obtained an estimate as B ~   1012 G. Third, [\citet=2010ApJ...715..947T], using the Chandra HETGS, detected from this source narrow iron Kα and Kβ lines, which are generally absent or much weaker in other LMXBs [\citep=2008ApJ...674..415C].

In the present study, we examine whether the NS in 4U 1822-  37 has B ~   1012 G or not. For this purpose, it is necessary to obtain spectra with a good energy resolution and a wide energy coverage. The fifth Japanese X-ray satellite Suzaku [\citep=2007PASJ...59S...1M], carrying onboard the XIS [\citep=2007PASJ...59S..23K] and the HXD [\citep=2007PASJ...59S..35T], is best suited for the requirements. We hence utilized an archival Suzaku data set of 4U 1822-  37, and study its spectral and pulsation properties. The mechanism of the periodic X-ray and optical dips, though interesting, is beyond the scope of the present paper.

Observations and Data Reduction

With Suzaku, 4U 1822-  37 was observed for an exposure 37 ks on 2006 October 20 (ID 401051010). In this observation, the target was placed at the XIS nominal position. Of the four XIS cameras, XIS0 was operated in the 1/4 window mode, and the others in the full window mode. The HXD was operated in the normal mode.

Using HEAsoft ver 6.12, we analyzed the data from XIS0, XIS2, XIS3 and HXD-PIN. In this study, we did not use XIS1 which is the back-illuminated camera, because it has a higher background and is subject to larger calibration uncertainties than the other XIS cameras. As the average counts rate of the XIS, ~   10 cts s- 1, was high enough to cause pile up under the full window mode, the XIS events were accumulated over an annular region with the inner and outer radii of 0[formula].5 and 2[formula].0, respectively. This allowed us to reduce pile up effects to within 1% [\citep=2012PASJ...64...53Y]. The response and arf files of the XIS were generated using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen, respectively. The HXD-PIN data were analyzed using a "tuned" non X-ray background file and the epoch2 response file, both officially released by the HXD team. We did not use the HXD-GSO data because the source was undetectable therein.

The present Suzaku data were already analyzed by [\citet=2011A&A...534A..85I]. Combined with previous data, they determined the orbital period to be Porb = 20054.2049 s = 5.57 hr, but did not report on pulse detection, or spectral analysis.

Results

Timing analysis

Figure [\ref=lightcurve] shows background-subtracted light curves of 4U 1822-  37 obtained with the XIS (1 to 10 keV) and HXD-PIN (15 to 60 keV), together with the HXD-PIN vs. XIS hardness ratio. The gross exposure of this observation (~  90 ks) covered about four orbital cycles, in which we detected about 4 dips in both the XIS and HXD-PIN bands. However, unlike the cases of many other dipping sources (e.g. XB 1916-  053, XB 1323-  619 and EXO 0748-  176), no X-ray bursts were detected. The same light curves, folded at Porb=20054.2049 s, are shown in figure [\ref=foldedlightcurve]. They are consistent with those of previous studies (e.g., [\cite=2008ApJ...673.1033I] [\cite=2011A&A...534A..85I]). From the bottom panel of figure [\ref=foldedlightcurve], the hardness ratio is observed to decrease during the dips.

We also tried to detect the pulsation at a period ~  0.59 s [\citep=2001ApJ...553L..43J], using only the HXD-PIN data because of the low time resolution of the XIS. After applying barycentric corrections to the individual HXD-PIN events, we further corrected the event arrive times for the expected orbital delay, Δt, in 4U 1822-  37. This Δt is calculated with the pulsar's semi-major axis a and the inclination i as

[formula]

where φ0 (0 ≤  φ0  ≤   1) is the initial orbital phase. We fixed a sin i at 1.006 lt-s, after an accurate measurement by [\citet=2001ApJ...553L..43J], and chose φ0 = 0.445 so that Δt becomes maximum at the observed X-ray dips. After these corrections, we calculated a 15-40 keV periodogram. As shown in figure [\ref=efsearch](a), the pulsation was detected with a high (>   99% confidence) significance at a period of Ps = 0.5924337 ±   0.000001 s. The pulse profile folded at Ps is presented in figure [\ref=efsearch](b). As already reported [\citep=2001ApJ...553L..43J], the pulse fraction is rather small, ~    ±  5% in the relative peak amplitude.

In figure [\ref=spinhistory], the measured value of Ps is compared with previous pulse-period measurements. Over the past ~   6 years, the object has thus been spinning up monotonically with an approximately constant rate of [formula]2.43±  0.05×  10- 12 s s- 1, or [formula]=6.7 kyr. This value of [formula] reconfirms the previous measurements by [\citet=2010MNRAS.409..755J].

Spectral analysis

Figure [\ref=compsepctra](a) shows 1-50 keV spectra of 4U 1822-  37 obtained with the XIS and HXD-PIN. The same spectra, normalized to a power-law model of photon index 2.0, are compared in figure [\ref=compsepctra](b) with those of another dipping source EXO 0748-  676 and the X-ray pulsar Her X-1. The spectral shape of 4U 1822-  37 is similar to that of Her X-  1 while different from that of EXO 0748-  676, in the following two points. First, the spectrum of 4U 1822-  37 shows a very hard slope (with a power-law photon index of Γ  ~  1) below 10 keV and a steep cutoff at ~   15 keV, in resemblance to the Her X-1 spectrum, while that of EXO 0748-  676 exhibits a softer (Γ  ~  2) slope without clear high-energy cutoff. Second, complex Fe K-α lines are seen at ~   6.4 keV in the spectra of 4U 1822-  37 and Her X-1, while they are absent in the case of EXO 0748-  676. These suggest that the NS in 4U 1822-  37 has strong magnetic fields, like that in Her X-  1 [\citep=2008PASJ...60S..57E].

To quantify the XIS and HXD-PIN spectra of 4U 1822-  37, we fitted them jointly with an absorbed cutoff-power-law (CutoffPL) model, including three narrow Gaussians to represent Fe-Kα, Fe XXV Kα, and Fe XXVI Kα lines, at ~  6.4, ~  6.7 and ~  6.9 keV, respectively. The photon index Γ, the cutoff energy Ecut, and normalization of CutoffPL were left free, as well as the column density of absorption. Similarly, the three Gaussians were allowed to have free center energies, free normalizations, and free widths. The HXD vs. XIS cross normalization was fixed at 1.16 [\citep=2007PASJ...59S..53K]. However, a large data excess below 3 keV made the fit unacceptable, with a reduced chi-square of χ2ν  >  3.0 for ν=287 degrees of freedom. To account for this "soft excess" feature, we chose a blackbody ( BB), and fitted the data with wabs×  (BB+CutoffPL+3gaussians). A BB with a temperature of ~   0.1 keV improved the fit to χ2ν=1.21 (ν=284). However, as shown in figure [\ref=spectrafit](b), there still remained negative residuals at ~   35 keV. Since they are suggestive of a CRSF, we employed a model of the form of wabs×  (BB+CutoffPL+3gaussians)×  cyclabs, where cyclabs represents the cyclotron resonance absorption factor given, e.g., in [\citet=1999ApJ...525..978M]. By allowing the resonance energy, width, and the depth of cyclabs to vary freely, the fit has been improved to χ2ν = 1.14 for ν=280. As summarized in table 1, the center energy of CRSF was obtained as ECRSF=33±  2 keV.

To make the model more physical, we once excluded the cyclabs factor, and tried a thermal Comptonizetion ( CompTT; e.g., [\cite=1995ApJ...450..876T]) and a "negative-positive power-law with exponential cutoff" ( NPEX; e.g., [\cite=1999ApJ...525..978M]) continua instead of CutoffPL, while retaining the BB component and the three Gaussians. As summarized in table 1, the CompTT continuum was less successful than that with CutoffPL, while the NPEX continuum was better. As shown in figure [\ref=spectrafit](e), however, the BB+NPEX continuum again left the negative residuals at ~  35 keV like the case of CutoffPL. We hence revived the cyclabs factor, and fitted the data with wabs×  (BB+NPEX+3gaussian)×  cyclabs. The fit has become fully acceptable, χ2ν=1.13 with ν=279.

The obtained cyclabs parameters, shown in table 1, are not much different from those with the CutoffPL continuum case, except that the width has now been constrained as 5.0+ 5.0- 3.0. While the error ranges in table 1 refer to 90% confidence limit, the cyclabs depth still remains positive, D  ≥  0.24, if we employ more conservatively 99% limit (i.e., Δχ2=6.63 for a single parameter). Since the inclusion of the cyclabs factor improved the fit by Δχ2=-  13.7 for Δν=-  3, or Δχ2/Δν = 4.56, an F-test indicates that the fit improvement is significant at a confidence level of 99%. Using the gabs model for the CRSF instead of the cyclabs model gave nearly the same χ2ν and a consistent value of ECRSF From these results, we can claim the detection of a CRSF.

The 1-50 keV flux of this source becomes 1.5[formula] erg s- 1 cm- 2, and the luminosity is LX =1.0×  1036 erg s- 1 at the distance of 2.5 kpc [\citep=1982MNRAS.200..793M]. These are consistent with previous reports [\citep=1982MNRAS.200..793M] [\citep=2001ApJ...557...24I].

Discussion

Spectral shape

In figure [\ref=compsepctra](b), the spectra of 4U 1822-  37 were visually compared with those of Her X-1 and EXO 0748-  676. For doing this more quantitatively, we fitted the CutoffPL model to Suzaku spectra of other hard-state LMXBs (Aql X-  1, EXO 0748-  676, XB 1323-  619, 4U 1636+536 and 4U 1608-  52), and accreting pulsars which have strong magnetic fields (4U 1626-  67, Cen X-3, SMC X-1, Her X-1, GRO J1008-  57, 1A 1118-  61, 1A 0535+26 and LMC X-4). Figure [\ref=gammacutoff] summarized those fit results, on a plane of Γ vs Ecut. The hard state LMXBs typically have softer (Γ  ~  1.7) slopes and higher cutoff energies (Ecut  >   50 keV), while the accreting pulsars show harder (Γ  ~  0.6) slopes together with lower cutoff energies ([formula]10 keV). Clearly, 4U 1822-  37 is more similar to the accreting pulsars than to the hard-state LMXBs. In terms of the continuum slope, 4U 1822-  37 is thus inferred to have common characteristics of accreting NSs with [formula] G.

The Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature

As argued in [\citet=1999ApJ...525..978M], the high-energy cutoff of the spectra of accreting pulsars, which are often steeper than a thermal rollover as pointed out by [\citet=1986LNP...255..198T], is presumably caused by the presence of a CRSF, which is empirically thought to appear at energies of [formula]. Then the NPEX fit results, Ecut=4.8-6.2 keV, predict a CRSF to appear at ECRSF=16-23 keV. This argument was already employed by [\citet=2001ApJ...553L..43J] to suggest [formula] G.

Indeed, as expected, we have detected a CRSF at [formula] keV with a high significance. Using the basic relation of B=[formula] G (e.g., [\cite=1999ApJ...525..978M]), where z is the gravitational redshift of the NS, we obtain B=(2.8±  0.2)[formula] G assuming z=0 for simplicity. This gives the most convincing evidence that the NS in 4U 1822-  37 is strongly magnetized.

Just to make the CRSF detection more convincing, let us examine the derived CRSF parameters. As already confirmed, the resonance energy ECRSF is consistent with the continuum shape. The depth, [formula], is reasonable, in comparison with typical values of D=0.1-1.7 found in other objects. In addition, W=2-10 keV=(0.06-0.30)ECRSF agrees, within errors, with the general scaling of W=(0.27-0.50)ECRSF found by [\citet=1999ApJ...525..978M]. Thus, the present CRSF interpretation of the ~  33 keV spectral feature is considered reasonable.

Spin period and Spin-up rate

The present HXD data yielded Ps = 0.5924337 s and [formula] = -2.43[formula] s s- 1. When these values, together with B=2.8[formula] G, are substituted into the accretion torque formula by [\citet=1978ApJ...223L..83G], namely

[formula]

where L37 is the luminosity in units of 1037 erg s- 1 and B12 is the magnetic field in 1012 G, we obtain [formula] erg s- 1.

This luminosity is much higher than the value of ~  1.0[formula] erg s- 1 derived from the observed flux and an assumed distance of 2.5 kpc [\citep=1982MNRAS.200..793M]. One possible cause of this discrepancy is that the object is in really located at [formula] kpc distance, instead of the 2.5 kpc which is based on some assumptions. An alternative possibility, already pointed out previously ([\cite=1982ApJ...257..318W] [\cite=2000A&A...356..175P]), is that the object appears unusually X-ray faint due, e.g., to X-ray obscuration by some ionized materials on the accretion disk. Indeed, its X-ray to optical luminosity ratio of ~  20 for LX  ~  1×  1036 erg s- 1 ([\cite=1982MNRAS.200..793M]) is much lower than a typical value of ~  500 for LMXBs ([\cite=1995xrbi.nasa...58V]). The ratio of 4U 1822-  37 will increase to ~  600 if we employ LX  ~  3×  1037 erg s- 1.

Iron lines

Another interesting discussion may be performed on the iron lines in the spectra. Generally, LMXBs have weak, sometimes broad [\citep=2008ApJ...674..415C] iron lines with small equivalent width (EWs); e.g., [formula] eV [\citep=2012PASJ...64...72S]. Strongly magnetized NSs, including Her X-  1 and GX 1+4, in contrast show narrow iron lines with significantly larger EWs (>   50 eV; [\cite=2010ApJ...715..947T]). These differences can be employed as an additional empirical argument to strengthen the high B scenario of 4U 1822-  37, although theoretical account of this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper. In this respect, The narrow (σ=0.04 keV) and strong (EW~   50 eV) Fe Kα line, detected at 6.4 keV with the XIS, clearly classifies this NS into the high-field category.

To be somewhat more quantitative, the width of the Fe Kα line, 0.04±  0.02 keV, implies that the velocity vgas of the gases which emit the iron line is ~   0.6% of the light speed. Assuming that the gas obeys Keplar rotation, its distance becomes [formula] cm (G being the gravitational constant and [formula] the NS mass), which is comparable to the Alfven radius (~  108 - 9 cm) for [formula] G while much larger than the NS radius ([formula] cm). Therefore, the matter creating the fluorescent Fe-K line is likely to be stored on the Alfven surface.

In the present data, we detected not only the nearly neutral Fe Kα line, but also the other two lines which are identified as Helium like (Fe XXV) line and Hydrogen like iron (Fe XXVI) line as judged from their line energies. Empirically, such ionized iron lines are observed from X-ray pulsars mainly when the source luminosity is high; e.g., LX  ≥  1[formula] erg s- 1. Such examples include Cen X-3 [\citep=2011ApJ...737...79N], Her X-1 [\citep=2009ApJ...700..977J], LMC X-4 [\citep=2009ApJ...696..182N], and Be pulsars in luminous outbursts [\citep=2013ApJ...764..158N]. Quantitatively this is reasonable, because ionization of circum-source materials is determined by so-called ionization parameter ξ=LX / (ne  ·  r2), where ne is the electron density of the line emitter while r is its distance from the NS (ionizing photon source). Assuming that the two ionized lines in 4U 1822-  37 are emitted by the same material that is different from those emitting the 6.4 keV line, we estimate as [formula], from [\citet=1982ApJS...50..263K] and the comparable EWs of the two ionized lines (table1). Employing the same argument as for rgas, we may obtain [formula] cm from the line width of [formula] keV. Adopting ne=[formula] cm- 3 from [\citet=2013A&A...549A..33I], the luminosity is 1[formula] erg s- 1, in agreement with estimate using equation (2). Thus, the source is considered to be relatively luminous in X-rays.

During the net exposure of 37 ks ([formula]h), no X-ray bursts were detected. Similarly, there have been not previous reports of burst detection from this objects. While this could be due to rather infrequent burst occurrence at [formula] erg s- 1 ([\cite=2003A&A...405.1033C]), a more appropriate explanation would be to regard 4U 1822-  37 as an X-ray pulsar, which do not produce X-ray bursts.

We hence conclude that 4U 1822-  37 is another example of LMXB that contains a strongly magnetized (B  ~  3×  1012 G) NS. Furthermore, its luminosity is likely to be ~  3×  1037 erg s- 1, instead of the previously reported value of ~  1×  1036 erg s- 1, although it is at present unclear whether this discrepancy is due to inaccurate distance estimate, on due to the edge-on source geometry which could reduce the X-ray flux reaching us.
