Abstract. We describe solutions of the matrix equation exp (z(A - In)) = A, where [formula]. Applications in quantum computing are given. Both normal and nonnormal matrices are studied. For normal matrices, the Lambert W-function plays a central role.

Introduction

The motivation of this paper comes from the following observation. Let σ1, σ2, σ3 be the Pauli spin matrices

[formula]

and [formula] be the 2  ×  2 identity matrix, then

[formula]

These identities play a role in quantum theory [\cite=1]. An extension is

[formula]

where the 2n  ×  2n matrices [formula] are elements of the Pauli group. Thus we ask the question: find all n  ×  n matrices A over [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

Equation (1) can also be written in the form ezA = ezA. The trivial solution is given by A = In with z arbitrary. Since [formula] for any n  ×  n matrix M over [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Since exp (z((A) - n)) is nonzero we can conclude that A must be invertible. Note that if A and B are similar matrices, then B satisfies (1) when A satisfies (1) and vice versa. An important special case for a solution of equation (1) can be given at once. Let B be an n  ×  n matrix with B2 = In. Then

[formula]

The proof is based on the identity [formula]

[formula]

for any n  ×  n matrix B with B2 = In. Setting z = iπ / 2 + ikπ we obtain the identity (2) utilizing that sin (π / 2 + kπ) = ( - 1)k and cos (π / 2 + kπ) = 0. No other solution exists when B2 = In.

We investigate first normal matrices and then nonnormal matrices. Finally a number of applications are provided.

Solutions for Normal Matrices

We solve the problem under the assumption that A is a normal matrix, i.e. AA* = A*A. Let U be the unitary matrix that diagonalizes A, i.e.

[formula]

where λj are the eigenvalues of A. Then from ez(A - In) = A we find

[formula]

Consequently ez(D - In) = D and

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

Clearly z = 0 gives A = In. However, A = In does not constrain z. In the following we restrict our discussion to the case z  ≠  0 and A  ≠  In.

The solution of e- z  =  λe- zλ can be given as

[formula]

where W is (any branch of) the Lambert W-function [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. The Lambert W-function is defined by z = W(z) exp (W(z)) with the properties

[formula]

Thus for any [formula] we can construct a normal matrix A satisfying (1) using the Lambert W-function. In particular, consider z =  - iωt, where ω is the frequency and t the time. Then

[formula]

With ω  =  π / 2 we have eiωt = i and hence λ = 1 since the Lambert W-function satisfies W( - π / 2) = iπ / 2. The Lambert W-function for matrices has been studied by Higham [\cite=5] and Corliss et al [\cite=6].

Now we consider the relationship between eigenvalues of A. Since e- z  =  λje- zλj for all [formula]. If λj = 1 then the j-th equation is satisfied identically. If [formula] then there must exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Suppose there exists [formula] with λp  ≠  λj, then we also have

[formula]

for some [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

We have the following cases:

A = In, [formula]

A has r  ≠  0 distinct eigenvalues λ1  ≠  1, λ2  ≠  1, , λr  ≠  1;

[formula]

for some [formula] and for all [formula]

[formula]

and any remaining eigenvalues are 1.

Thus A and z satisfy (1) if and only if one of the above cases hold.

Solutions for Nonnormal Matrices

Note that also some nonnormal matrices N can satisfy the condition that N2 = In, so that the solution (2) holds. Consider for example

[formula]

with ε  ≠  0. Thus N*N  ≠  NN*. Another example is the matrix

[formula]

with ε  ≠  0.

In general, if A is a fixed n  ×  n matrix, let [formula] be the largest linearly independent set constructed from powers of A (by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem r  ≤  n - 1) then there exists cj(z) ([formula]) such that

[formula]

Thus any solutions z satisfy

[formula]

The case N2 = In above follows as a special case when r = 1.

Similar to the normal matrices case in the previous section, the eigenvalues of A obey the relations below. However, in these cases additional constraints on U are necessary.

Assume A satisfies (1), then we have the following cases:

A = In + U, [formula]; for some strictly upper triangular matrix U  ≠  0

A has r  ≠  0 distinct eigenvalues λ1  ≠  1, λ2  ≠  1, , λr  ≠  1;

[formula]

for some [formula] and for all [formula]

[formula]

and any remaining eigenvalues are 1.

Thus if A and z satisfy (1) then one of the above cases hold.

Applications

Let Ĥ be the Hamilton operator acting in a finite dimensional Hilbert space [formula]. Thus Ĥ would be an n  ×  n hermitian matrix. The solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by

[formula]

Thus if Ĥ  =  ωK with K2 = In we have

[formula]

where we utilized that [formula], [formula]. Thus to satisfy the equation ezA = ezA we have to set ωt = π / 2. Then we obtain

[formula]

with e- iπ / 2 =  - i.

As an example consider the triple spin Hamilton operator (Steeb [\cite=7])

[formula]

Since [formula] we obtain

[formula]

If ωt = π / 2, then cos (π / 2) = 0, sin (π / 2) = 1 and we obtain

[formula]

where e- iπ / 2 =  - i.

Many quantum gates ([\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10] [\cite=11]) such as the Hadamard gate UH and the CNOT-gate

[formula]

and Swap gate

[formula]

satisfy the condition that the square is the identity matrix.

If the n  ×  n matrices X and Y satisfy X2 = In, Y2 = In, then [formula] and [formula] satisfy [formula] and [formula], where [formula] denotes the direct sum. An application would be the Pauli spin matrices, for example [formula], [formula] or [formula], [formula]. The elements [formula], [formula] are elements of the Pauli group. The n-qubit Pauli group Pn is defined by

[formula]

The n-qubit Pauli group Pn is of order 4n + 1.

Conclusion

We solved the matrix equation exp (zA) =  exp (z)A for normal matrices. We have also shown that solutions for nonnormal matrices exist.
