Introduction

In [\cite=DP1], Dimitrov and Penkov extended the classical Lie's theorem to the infinite dimensional case. Let V be a vector space over an algebraically closed field k of zero characteristic. Let fgl(V) denote the Lie algebra of finite rank linear transformations on V. Dimitrov and Penkov proved that every maximal, locally solvable subalgebra of fgl(V) is the stabilizer of a maximal, generalized flag in V. Moreover, there is a 1-1 correspondence between maximal, closed generalized flags in V and maximal, locally solvable subalgebras of fgl(V).

In this paper we use Model Theory to prove the following:

In [\cite=DP1] it is shown that we cannot expect a 1-1 correspondence between maximal, locally solvable subalgebras and maximal generalized flags in this generality. Moreover, the work of Dan-Cohen in [\cite=EDC] shows that we cannot even expect a 1-1 correspondence between maximal, locally solvable subalgebras and maximal, closed generalized flags in an arbitrary locally finite Lie algebra.

Preliminaries

A Lie algebra L is locally finite dimensional, or simply locally finite, if every finitely generated subalgebra is finite dimensional. An L-module V is integrable if for every finite subset [formula] of V and for every finitely generated subalgebra Lα of L, [formula] is contained in a finite dimensional Lα-submodule. Equivalently, V is an integrable module if and only if the Lie algebra [formula] is locally finite.

In a finite dimensional vector space V, a flag is a chain of subspaces [formula], where dim Vi  =  i. In an infinite dimensional vector space, this definition will no longer suffice-we will instead use generalized flags, which were introduced in [\cite=DP2].

We may write [formula] where F'α is the immediate predecessor of F''α and A is linearly ordered by [formula] if and only if F'α  ⊂  F'β. A generalized flag [formula] is maximal if and only if dim F''α  /  F'α  =  1 for all α∈A.

Let X be a set. For the definition and properties of ultrafilters on the set X, see [\cite=H] or [\cite=M]. We will use the following theorem of Malcev, found in [\cite=M]:

The following lemma gives examples of maximal, generalized flags using an ultrafilter F.

Let X be a set, and let {Vα}α∈X be a family of finite dimensional vector spaces. Let Fα be a flag in Vα and let F be an ultrafilter on X. Then [formula] is a maximal, generalized flag in the vector space [formula].

For each α∈X, Fα is a flag in Vα, i.e. a chain of subspaces [formula] where nα  =   dim Vα. Each element [formula] is a function on X: for each α∈X, f(α)  =  Vαi, a subspace which appears in the flag Fα, with the usual equivalence relation given by the ultrafilter. Thus, each element of [formula] is a subspace of [formula].

We can also identify each element [formula] with a function [formula] such that for all α∈X, [formula], where q(α)  =  i  ⇔  f(α)  =  Vαi. We shall adopt this viewpoint of elements of [formula] for the remainder of the proof.

We totally order [formula] by inclusion: for p, [formula], we have

[formula]

Since F is an ultrafilter, only one of the Ai's are in F: if A1∈F, then we say p  >  q, if A2∈F, then p  =  q, if A3∈F, then p  <  q. Note that p  ≤  q if and only if p is a subset of q. Hence [formula] is a set of subspaces in [formula] totally ordered by inclusion.

It is clear that the subspace (0), which is identified with the function qmin(α)  =  0 [formula], is minimal with respect to this ordering, and [formula], which is identified with the function qmax(α)  =  nα [formula], is maximal. Every other [formula] actually has both an immediate predecessor and successor: for each q, we define the successor as (q + 1)(α)  =  q(α) + 1 for all α such that q(α)  ≠  nα and the predecessor as (q - 1)(α)  =  q(α) - 1 for all α such that q(α)  ≠  0. Then (q  -  1)  <  q  <  (q + 1) and we claim that dim (q + 1) / q  =  1 for each q  ≠  qmax: the set A  =  {α∈X|q(α)  <  nα} must be in F, since q  ≠  qmax, so for each α∈A we can choose wα∈(q + 1)(α)  -  (q)(α) and define [formula] by w(α)  =  wα for α∈A and w(α)  =  0 else. Then w∈(q + 1) - q, and since dim (q + 1)(α)  /  q(α)  =  1 for α∈A and {α∈X|q(α)  +  kwα  =  (q + 1)(α)}  ⊃  A∈F, we have that (q + 1)  =  q  +  kw. Hence dim (q + 1) / q  =  1, which implies that [formula] is a maximal chain of subspaces in [formula].

Lastly, let [formula] be given such that v  ≠  0, that is, A  =  {α∈X|v(α)  ≠  0}∈F. Then for each α∈A, we can choose some [formula] such that v(α)∈Vαiα  -  Vαiα  -  1. Define [formula] by qv(α)  =  iα for α∈A and qv(α)  =  0 else. Then v∈(qv)  -  (qv  -  1). Hence, [formula] is a maximal generalized flag in [formula].

A Lie algebra L is locally solvable if every finitely generated subalgebra is solvable.

Suppose L is a locally finite Lie algebra and V is an integrable, faithful module over L. If L stabilizes a maximal, generalized flag in V, then L is locally solvable.

Let X be the set of nonempty finite subsets of L, and let Lα be the finite dimensional Lie algebra generated by α∈X. To show L is locally solvable, it suffices to show that each Lα is a solvable Lie algebra, which we do by constructing a finite dimensional faithful Lα  -  module and applying the classical Lie's theorem.

Fix α∈X, a finite subset of L. We claim that we can find a faithful, finite dimensional Lα-submodule of V. Choose some nonzero v1∈V, which by assumption is contained in a finite dimensional Lα-submodule V1. If Lα acts faithfully on V1, we are done. Otherwise, there is some nonzero x∈Lα such that x  ·  V1  =  0, that is, x∈K1, the kernal of the action of Lα on V1. Since 0  ≠  x∈L and L acts faithfully on V, there is some v2∈V such that x  ·  v2  ≠  0. Let V2 be the finite dimensional Lα-submodule generated by V1 and v2. If Lα acts faithfully on V2, we are done. If not, then the kernal of the action of Lα, denoted K2, is nontrivial. However, since x  ·  v2  ≠  0, we have that x  ·  V2  ≠  0. Thus x∈K1  -  K2 and dim K2  <   dim K1  ≤   dim Lα. We can repeat this process, creating a larger finite dimensional Lα-module with a strictly smaller kernal. Since Lα is finite dimensional, this will eventually terminate with a finite dimensional faithful Lα-module, which we call Vα.

Let [formula] denote the maximal generalized flag stabilized by L, and hence also by Lα. It is straightforward to check that the set of distinct subspaces from [formula] is a flag in Vα, which is invariant under Lα. Since Lα stabilizes a flag in the finite dimensional, faithful module Vα, it follows that Lα is solvable.

Proof of the Main Theorem

We now prove the main result of this paper.

Let B be a maximal, locally solvable subalgebra of L, hence V is an integrable module over B. Let X denote the set of pairs α  =  (α',α''), where α' is a nonempty finite subset of B and α'' is a nonempty finite subset of V. Let Bα denote the finite dimensional subalgebra of B generated by α', and let Vα denote the finite dimensional Bα-submodule of V generated by α''.

Let Xα  =  {β  =  (β',β'')∈X|α'  ⊆  β',α''  ⊆  β''}. Since finite intersections of elements from the set {Xα}α∈X are nonempty, {Xα} embeds into an ultrafilter, F. Thus, by Malcev's theorem, B embeds into the Lie algebra [formula], V embeds into the vector space [formula], and since Bα acts on Vα, we have that [formula] acts on [formula] via: (b  ·  v)(α)  =  b(α)  ·  v(α).

[formula]

We claim that this embedding respects the action of B on V, i.e. φ(V) is an ψ(B)-submodule of [formula]. We need to show for x∈B and v∈V, φ(x  ·  v)  =  ψ(x)  ·  φ(v) in [formula], which is equivalent to the set A  =  {α∈X|φ(x  ·  v)(α)  =  ψ(x)(α)  ·  φ(v)(α)}∈F. Define β  =  (β',β'')∈X by β'  =  {x} and β''  =  {v}. Then certainly x∈Bβ, v∈Vβ, and x  ·  v∈Vβ, so φ(x  ·  v)(β)  =  x  ·  v  =  ψ(x)(β)  ·  φ(v)(β). Thus A  ⊇  Xβ∈F, so A∈F as well. Hence, we can think of V as an B-submodule of [formula].

Since B is locally solvable, each Bα is a finite dimensional solvable Lie algebra which acts on Vα. Hence by Lie's theorem, Bα stabilizes a flag Fα in Vα. Since each Fα is stable under Bα, it follows that [formula] is stable under [formula]. By lemma [\ref=flags] the ultraproduct [formula] is a maximal generalized flag in [formula] which is stabilized by [formula], and hence is stabilized by B as well.

To obtain a maximal generalized flag in V, consider the set [formula] (Here we are using the copy of V embedded in [formula] by φ). This is a chain of B-submodules of V which may not be a generalized flag-however, we can generate a maximal generalized flag by defining for each 0  ≠  v∈V, [formula] and [formula] using the definition for qv as in the proof of lemma [\ref=flags]. Then [formula] is a generalized flag which is maximal, since dim F''v  /  F'v  =  1 for each v∈V. Since each [formula] is stabilized by B, so is each [formula] and hence F''v and F'v for each v∈V. Hence, [formula] is a maximal generalized flag in V which is stabilized by B.

Thus, we have that [formula], the stabilizer of [formula] in L. By lemma [\ref=stabilizer], [formula] is a locally solvable subalgebra of L. Since B is a maximal, locally solvable subalgebra, it must be that [formula]. Hence, B is the stabilizer of the maximal, generalized flag [formula].

Appendix: Ultrafilters and Ultraproducts

The results in this section are standard, and we refer the reader to [\cite=H] or [\cite=M] for more details.

Ultrafilters

A filter over a set [formula] is a collection of subsets F such that

If X is any infinite set, the collection of cofinite sets forms a filter on X.

There is a partial ordering on filters: D1  ≤  D2 if [formula], S∈D2. An ultrafilter is a maximal filter with respect to this ordering. By Zorn's lemma, every filter may be embedded into an ultrafilter.

A system S of subsets of X embeds into a filter (and hence ultrafilter) if and only if all finite intersections of elements from S are nonempty.

First, suppose that S is contained in a filter F. Then if [formula] is a finite collection of elements from S, each of the Ai is in F, and so [formula] and hence must be nonempty.

Now, suppose S satisfies the finite intersection property, and let

[formula]

In other words, the set F is obtained by including all supersets of all intersections of finitely many elements from S. Clearly, S is contained in such a set. We wish to show F is a filter.

First, [formula] since every finite intersection of elements from S is nonempty. If A, B∈F, i.e. [formula] for some Ai∈S, and [formula] for some Bj, then [formula], and hence [formula], so F is closed under finite intersections. Lastly, if A∈F and A  ⊆  B, then [formula] for some Ai∈S and so [formula] as well, implying B∈F and so F is closed under supersets and hence forms a filter.

A filter F on X is an ultrafilter if and only if given any subset T  ⊂  X, T∈F or X  -  T∈F.

First, if F is a filter with this property, then F must be maximal: Suppose F is strictly contained in another filter [formula], i.e. there is some subset T∈  -  F. Since T is not in F, X  -  T∈F by assumption and hence X  -  T∈ as well. But then both T and X - T are in [formula], implying that their intersection [formula], a contradiction.

Now, suppose F is an ultrafilter and T  ⊂  X such that T is not in F. We wish to show X  -  T∈F. If for all S∈F, [formula], then by Lemma [\ref=embedding_lemma] T and F embed into a strictly larger filter, which contradicts the maximality of F. Hence, we may choose some S1∈F such that [formula]. If X - T is also not in F, then there is some S2∈F such that [formula]. Since S1 and S2 are in F, [formula]. Then we have:

[formula]

This is a contradiction; hence, we must have that X  -  T∈F.

Ultraproducts

Suppose {Aα|α∈X} is a collection of algebraic structures of the same type (i.e. each Aα is a group, field, Lie algebra, vector space, etc.) Then we can define the Cartesian product [formula] which consists of functions [formula] where f(α)∈Aα for all α∈X. [formula] is the same type of algebraic structure as each of its constituents, where each operation is defined pointwise.

Now let F be an ultrafilter on X. Define an equivalence relation on [formula] by f  ~  g if {α∈X|f(α)  =  g(α)}∈F. The ultraproduct [formula] is the set of equivalence classes, and one may check that this is again the same kind of algebraic structure as each of the Aα.

Let [formula] be the set of all primes, and let F be an ultrafilter on X containing all cofinite sets. Let [formula], and form the ultraproduct [formula]. This is again a field which, in fact, has characteristic zero.

Let F be an ultrafilter on X. If [formula] are pairwise disjoint subsets such that [formula], then exactly one of the Ai is in F.

We use Lemma [\ref=ultrafilter_lemma]: since [formula], we have [formula], and so X - Ai∉F for some i since F is closed under finite intersections, and so again by Lemma [\ref=ultrafilter_lemma], Ai∈F. If more than one Ai∈F, say Ai and Aj are both in F for i  ≠  j, then since they are disjoint, [formula] which is a contradiction. Hence, one and only one of the Ai is in F.

Let F be an ultrafilter on [formula] containing all cofinite sets, and let [formula] be the set of sequences in [formula]. Then we can form the ultraproduct [formula], which contains a copy of [formula] via the map [formula]. Let (an) and (bn) be two sequences and consider the sets:

[formula]

Since [formula], by Lemma [\ref=totally_order_lemma] we have that exactly one of the Ai is in F and from this we can define a total ordering on [formula]: if A1∈F, we say (an)  >  (bn), if A2∈F, then (an)  =  (bn), and if A3∈F, (an)  <  (bn).

Now consider the element [formula], i.e. [formula] [formula]. In the ultraproduct, [formula] for all [formula] since [formula] is a cofinite set and hence in F; however, unlike in the standard real numbers, ε  ≠  0.

The next theorem is a less precise wording of a theorem in [\cite=M] (theorem 2, section 8.3). We state it in this way to elucidate its meaning and its applications.

Every algebraic system embeds into an ultraproduct of its finitely generated subsystems.

Let A be an algebraic system, let X be the set of all nonempty finite subsets of A, i.e. [formula]. Clearly, X is an index set for the finitely generated subsystems of A. For α∈X, define Xα  =  {β∈X|α  ⊆  β}, which will be nonempty since α∈Xα. Then {Xα}α∈X is a system of subsets of X such that any finite intersection is nonempty: indeed, for α,β∈X we have:

[formula]

Hence, by Lemma [\ref=embedding_lemma], we are able to embed {Xα}α∈X into an ultrafilter, F.

For α∈X, let Aα be the subsystem of A generated by α (i.e. the smallest subsystem of A containing the finite set α). Let [formula] denote the ultraproduct [formula]. We wish to show that A embeds into [formula].

Choose [formula], i.e. [formula] where d(α)∈Aα (the choice of d does not matter). Define the map [formula] by:

[formula]

Suppose we have an operation [formula] defined on A and hence on each Aα and on the ultraproduct [formula]. Then we show that [formula] in [formula], i.e. the set [formula] is in F.

[formula]

Hence, since F is closed under supersets, the desired property holds and we conclude that ψ is a mapping of algebraic structures.

Lastly, we show ψ is injective: suppose to the contrary that x  ≠  y in A but ψx  =  ψy in [formula], i.e. the set T  =  {α|ψx(α)  =  ψy(α)}∈F. Then by Lemma [\ref=ultrafilter_lemma], X - T  =  {α|ψx(α)  ≠  ψy(α)} is not in F. However,

[formula]

(This follows because x  ≠  y and the sets {x} and {y} are certainly finite subsets of A.) This is a contradiction-hence, ψ is an injective map, and we can embed A as a subsystem of the ultraproduct [formula].
