Revisiting the plasma sheath -- dust in plasma sheath

Introduction

The physics of sheath in plasmas is an intriguing subject in fundamental plasma physics and has been widely studied. Nevertheless, by no means the study can be considered to be complete. The basic reason behind this is the hugely varied categories of space and laboratory plasmas with disparate physical conditions, where plasma sheaths form. These phenomena range from basic laboratory plasmas (gas discharge devices)[\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] to fusion plasma devices (viz. tokamaks)[\cite=5] and from ionospheric plasmas in planetary atmospheres[\cite=6] to astrophysical plasmas such as planetary nebulae[\cite=7] [\cite=8]. The plasma solitons can also be considered as close cousins of stationary plasma sheaths, which occur in laboratory as well as space plasmas and can be considered as moving sheaths[\cite=9] in a plasma. Insight into sheath dynamics requires the Poisson's equation to be solved with certain assumptions for the ion and electron densities and only if the relevant parameters are known. Tonks and Langmuir[\cite=key-5] were among the firsts to be able to reduce the complete sheath equation to a simpler integral equation. Their solution gives the potential distribution within the plasma. Auer[\cite=key-6], Caruso and Cavaliere[\cite=key-7], and Self[\cite=key-8] have analyzed the phenomena to find out the potential distribution solution throughout the plasma and in the sheath region. It was Riemann[\cite=16], who presented a review regarding the sheath formation and the basic features of sheath and its relation to Bohm sheath criterion. As the study of plasma sheath has gained attention due to its practical importance, researchers have been able to establish a very good correlation between the theory and the experiment[\cite=key-13] [\cite=key-12] [\cite=key-11] [\cite=key-10].

Though by plasmas we usually mean electron-ion plasmas, practically they are never so pure and always have contaminations in the form of dust. In extreme cases, these become dusty plasmas. In almost all plasma sheaths, which usually form due to plasma-wall interactions, some kind of impurities do intrude into the sheath. We in this work, have studied such a phenomena which we refer to as dust in plasma sheath. As we know, dust particles are abundant in all kinds of plasmas and they modify the plasma dynamics by being constituent plasma component which happens as electrons (usually) settle down on the dust surfaces due to their large electrical capacitance. In most cases, the charging of the dust particles is treated in collisionless plasma physics, theoretically with the well known Orbit Motion Limited (OML) theory[\cite=10] [\cite=11] [\cite=12]. As the dust particles are considerably heavier [formula], their dynamical time scale is quite larger than the slowest electron-ion time scale i.e. ion-acoustic time scale. However they do affect the ion-acoustic dynamics by creating a charge imbalance in the electron-ion population. Usually this is through electron depletion, although one can fabricate different physical scenarios in laboratory plasmas[\cite=13], where positively charged dust particles are present.

Among different space plasma environments, the Moon provides a convenient natural laboratory to study plasma-wall interactions in the space environment. From various satellite observations, we now know that a thin layer of dust [formula] exists around the lunar surface[\cite=key-15]. Lunar Prospector (LP) and Apollo-era missions gave the first hint that there must be a complex and coupled system of plasmas and dust over the Moon's surface[\cite=key-17]. The ambient plasma and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation incident on the lunar surface are the main causes that the surface of the Moon becomes electrically charged. On the dayside, photoemission typically dominates and the lunar surface charges to a positive potential, while on the nightside the plasma electrons usually dominate and the surface of the Moon charges to a negative potential[\cite=key-17] [\cite=key-19]. As the lunar surface (and other bodies without any protective environments) is exposed to solar UV radiation, cosmic rays, and constant bombardment by interplanetary bodies, a plasma sheath forms immediately above the lunar surface into which dust particles are injected from the regolith. This provides a very natural environment to study the complex plasma sheath dynamics.

In this work, we have revisited the phenomena of plasma sheath with a considerable presence of dust particles. In the ion-acoustic time-scale, the the dust dynamics can be neglected and the dust particles are considered to be stationary. The dust particles affect the sheath dynamics by affecting the plasma potential. We have self-consistently considered the dust-effects in the Poisson equation, which is then solved to obtain the plasma and dust potentials. As we consider a stationary sheath, we consider the current to the dust particles to be balanced throughout the formation of the plasma sheath. As a result, different currents to the surface of a dust particle become dependent on the grain potential, which is a function of the particle size. The resultant steady-state model is a 4-dimensional differential model, which we have reduced to a one-dimensional integro-differential model, owing to the integrability of the ion continuity and ion momentum equations. Our results show that the dust-effect in the Poisson equation considerably changes the structure of the dust layer, which might form as a result of levitation due to oppositely directed electrostatic and gravitational forces. As a probable application, we have used parameters for lunar plasma environment, though the results obtained in this work could be used in other plasma-wall interactions as well, with appropriate parameters. In Sec.II, we consider our plasma model. In Sec.III, we develop the sheath model. In Sec.IV, we consider the dust-effects on the plasma sheath. In Sec.V, we consider contributions of various forces on a dust particle inside a plasma sheath. Finally, in Sec.VI, we summarise our results.

Plasma model

Our basic equations are due to a collisionless electron-ion plasma with a considerable presence of dust grains. The equations (in 1-D) are ion continuity and momentum equations and electrons are assumed to be Boltzmannian owing to their negligible mass,

[formula]

where φ is the plasma potential and the temperature is expressed in energy unit. We use the ion equation of state as,

[formula]

The model is closed by the Poisson equation,

[formula]

All the symbols have their usual meanings. Note that the presence of dust grains are incorporated into the model through the Poisson equation. The number of charge that resides on the surface of a dust grain is a function of the grain potential φg. We have chosen to normalize the plasma potential with Te / e, length with Debye length λD, velocity with ion-thermal velocity [formula], time with λD / us, electron, ion, and dust densities with the respective equilibrium densities ni0,e0, and ion pressure pi with ni0Ti. We also denote the ion to electron temperature ratio by σ = Ti / Te. The normalized equations now read as,

[formula]

where δi = ni0 / ne0 and δd = zd0nd0 / ne0 are the equilibrium density ratios.

Sheath equations

Consider now a stationary plasma sheath[\cite=13]. Far away from the sheath, the plasma potential vanishes and other plasma parameters approaches their bulk (equilibrium) values i.e. as x  →    ∞  , [formula], M is the Mach number and zd0 = zd(φ)|φ = 0 is the dust charge number in the bulk plasma. The steady state dynamical equations are,

[formula]

From the continuity equation, we have

[formula]

Integration of Eq.([\ref=eq:cons]) results the conservation of total energy flux which is a combination of the kinetic flux, enthalpy flux, and electrostatic flux,

[formula]

An expression for ni as a function of φ can be found from Eqs.([\ref=eq:eqn],[\ref=eq:phi]), which must be solved numerically for arbitrary γ. For γ = 3 however, we can find an analytical expression for ni(φ) as,

[formula]

The signs in front of the square roots are fixed through the boundary condition on ni. Expressing ion density as a function of the plasma potential, [formula], the Poisson's equation can be integrated to get,

[formula]

where V(φ,M,σ,γ) is the equivalent Sagdeev potential or pseudo potential[\cite=14] for a sheath, given by,

[formula]

where we have neglected the variation in the dust density keeping in view that dust particles can be considered to be stationary in the ion-acoustic time scale. For real solution, V(φ,M,σ,γ) < 0 for all values of φ. This also determines the minimum velocity for the ions [formula] at the sheath boundary (the Bohm condition[\cite=15] [\cite=16]). The boundary condition on V is: at φ = 0, V(φ) = 0. In Fig.[\ref=fig:pseudo-pot], the pseudo potential for various Mach numbers are shown for φ < 0 with δd = 0 (refer to Sec.3.3) and γ = 5 / 3.

The modified Bohm condition

The condition for ions to have a minimum velocity at the sheath boundary for which V(φ,M,σ,γ) < 0, gives rise to the so called Bohm condition[\cite=15] [\cite=16]. In general, for warm ions, we must find out the Bohm condition numerically. For warm ions with γ = 3 and δd = 0, we can find out the Bohm condition by demanding a local maxima for Vγ = 3(φ,M,σ)|φ  →   - 0,

[formula]

which reduces to the classical Bohm condition, [formula] for σ = 0[\cite=4].

Dust in plasma sheath

Wall potential

The electron distribution far away from the wall (or sheath) is given by the usual Maxwell's distribution[\cite=3] [\cite=13],

[formula]

The electron current at the wall is due to those electrons which can reach the wall with a minimum velocity v min to overcome the negative potential at the wall φw[\cite=13],

[formula]

from which we get the electron current density at the wall as,

[formula]

The ion current is given by[\cite=13],

[formula]

where u0 is the ion velocity (dimensional) at the sheath boundary (the Mach number). For a stationary sheath, we must have je + ji = 0, which determines the wall potential (normalized)[\cite=6],

[formula]

where M must have value for which V(φ,M,σ,γ) < 0.

Current balance

We assume that the current to the surface of dust particles remain balanced all throughout the plasma including the sheath[\cite=13]. So at any instant, we must have,

[formula]

We further assume that the dust particles are negatively charged. The ion current to the dust particles (dimensional) can be written as[\cite=13],

[formula]

where σi  =  πb2 is the collision cross-section for ions with the dust particles, b being the impact parameter. Conservation of angular momentum in an ion-dust collision leads to the condition,

[formula]

where ug is the grazing velocity for the ions[\cite=6] [\cite=13] with respect to a collision-event with dust particles and rd is the radius of a dust particle. From energy consideration, we further have

[formula]

where φd  =  φg  -  φ, φg being the grain potential. Using Eqs.([\ref=eq:ion-current]-[\ref=eq:energy-balance-collision]) we can write the normalized expression for Ii as,

[formula]

where rd is the dust radius measured in terms of Debye length. Through Eq.([\ref=eq:eqn]), the above equation becomes

[formula]

in which we need to substitute ni as a function of φ by solving Eq.([\ref=eq:phi]). We note that for cold ions, the ion current becomes

[formula]

which can be obtained by substituting σ = 0 in Eq.([\ref=eq:phi]). For negatively charged dust particles, the normalized electron current takes the form[\cite=13],

[formula]

where [formula]. The current balance equation, Eq.([\ref=eq:balance]) is now given by,

[formula]

Note that for spherical dust particles, the total amount of charge Qd on the surface of a dust particles can be written as,

[formula]

where C is the grain capacitance. The dust potential φd is the principal solution of Eq.([\ref=eq:normalised_current_balance]) and is shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:potentials] (right panel) against the normalized distance x for cold and warm sheath. The finite ion temperature (σ > 0) affects the dust potential through the ion density ni. In this figure, the plasma potential φ is a solution of the Poisson equation with δd = 0. Warm ions causes the sheath to expand much like a Debye shielding expanding with temperature. This can be seen from the behaviour of the potentials for warm sheaths, which approaches the bulk value at a larger x than in cold sheath.

Other contributions to Ie,i

We note that apart from the electron and ion currents to the dust particles, there are other sources[\cite=17] [\cite=18]. For example in case of dust particles near lunar surface, photoelectron current Iph emitted by the lunar surface and net photoemission current Ihν emitted by the dust particles may become significant[\cite=17]. For φd < 0, which usually is the case, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the photoemission current density and [formula] is the photoelectron current density. However, in this work for the sake of simplicity we have omitted these currents as contributions from both these currents can be incorporated into the ion and electron currents.

Negligible dust

When number of dust particles are considerably less than that of ions and electrons (nd  ≪  ni,e), δd can be neglected and the pseudo potential given by Eq.([\ref=eq:pseduo-potential]) can be evaluated without any effect from the dust,

[formula]

In such case, for γ = 3, we can analytically evaluate the above integration in,

[formula]

When the ion temperature is also neglected (σ = 0), we get the classical sheath equation[\cite=4],

[formula]

The above expression can also be obtained by a series expansion of Eq.([\ref=eq:pot]) or Eq.([\ref=eq:pseduo-potential]) in the limit [formula] when δd = 0 (equivalently δi = 1) .

With dust effects

When there are considerable presence of dust particles, they begin to affect the pseudo potential through the Poisson equation and we need to use the full form of the Poisson equation, Eq.([\ref=eq:poisson]). This procedure requires numerical solution of the plasma model. From Eqs.([\ref=eq:poisson],[\ref=eq:ni],[\ref=eq:normalised_current_balance]), the complete numerical model can be summarised as,

[formula]

where [formula] are numerical functions of φ corresponding to the ion density and dust potential. The function N(φ) can be evaluated by solving Eq.([\ref=eq:nneq]) which when substituted in Eq.([\ref=eq:nbal]), can be solved for F(φ). Poisson equation Eq.([\ref=eq:npois]) then, must be solved self-consistently to evaluate φ(x), which can be used to generate φd(x) and ni(x).

Note that the above system of equations can also be cast as a fully differentiable system,

[formula]

Many authors use the system as given by Eqs.([\ref=eq:np]-[\ref=eq:nb]) to solve the sheath problem with some initial conditions, usually starting from the bulk plasma[\cite=19] [\cite=20]. However, we note that starting with initial conditions in the bulk plasma (i.e. starting from the beginning of the sheath region and integrating toward the wall) is not suitable in many cases as all the derivatives in the above equations vanishes in the bulk plasma, thereby numerically rendering it impossible to evolve. To circumvent this, the standard procedure is to resort to a series expansion at the sheath boundary[\cite=19] [\cite=20], which is essentially like pushing the solution through its desired track and one may often arrive at erroneous values of the variables by the time the solution reaches the wall, depending on accuracy of the series expansion and the position of the sheath boundary. Besides, as Eqs.([\ref=eq:np]-[\ref=eq:nb]) is a four-dimensional system, in certain parameter regime the system may become highly sensitive to the initial conditions[\cite=21] and one may arrive at a completely different solution from what it was intended to. In our opinion, the differential system is best solved as a multi-dimensional boundary value problem (BVP). However solving a multi-dimensional BVP has its own demerits[\cite=22].

In this work, we choose to solve the system as given by Eqs.([\ref=eq:npois]-[\ref=eq:nbal]) by self consistently solving Eq.([\ref=eq:npois]) along with Eqs.([\ref=eq:nneq],[\ref=eq:nbal]). This is done by writing the Poisson equation in terms of the pseudo potential as an integro-differential equation,

[formula]

where we have substituted δd  =  δi - 1 (from the quasi-neutrality condition). We have solved the above equation with the help of a modified 4th order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step-size control[\cite=22] and evaluating the integrations numerically in each step. The differential equation is solved from the wall (x = 0) toward the bulk plasma (x  →    ∞  ) with the single initial condition φ(x = 0) = φw as given by Eq.([\ref=eq:wall_potential]). The evaluation of the integrations requires Eqs.([\ref=eq:nneq],[\ref=eq:nbal]) to be solved self-consistently, which is done with the help of Newton's method[\cite=22]. As we have the exact initial condition at our disposal, the solution can be built very accurately into the bulk plasma, as far as required. Practically we solve from x = 0 (wall) to a large number, say [formula] (bulk plasma).

The results are summarised in Fig.[\ref=fig:potentials-1] where we have shown the potentials for both cold (σ = 0) and warm (σ > 0) sheaths, with (δi > 1) and without (δi = 1) dust effects. The results are shown for two sets of values, each for the Mach number M, σ, and δi (for details, see figure caption). Note that a value of δi = 2 indicates 50% depletion of the electrons in comparison to ions and a value of δi = 5 indicates 80% depletion. We note that in the ion-acoustic time scale, the dust particles does not contribute to the wall potential but they modify the potential in the sheath by just being there as a huge collections of negative charges, requiring more number of ions to neutralise in the sheath away from the wall as compared to a sheath, devoid of dust. As a result, the sheath must get thicker as we move away from the wall. This effect can be seen in Fig.[\ref=fig:potentials-1].

Forces on dust particles

There may be several forces which act simultaneously on a dust particle[\cite=13]. The most significant of these are electrostatic, gravity, polarisation, ion drag, and neutral drag force. The total force [formula] on the dust particles (dimensional) can be written as,

[formula]

where the forces are respectively electrostatic, polarisation, gravity, ion drag, and neutral drag force. The electrostatic force is given by [formula]. The polarisation force [formula] can be important when shielding cloud around a dust particle becomes distorted due to polarisation, [formula] being the dipole moment. The polarisation force can be neglected except for very dense dusty plasmas[\cite=19] where there is a possibility of distortion of the charged cloud around a dust particle. The force due to gravity is given by [formula], where md is the mass of a dust particle and [formula] is the acceleration due to gravity.

The ion drag force is given by[\cite=20] [\cite=21] [\cite=22],

[formula]

where

[formula]

takes care of the momentum transfer due to ion-dust collision (collection force). The Coulomb scattering part of ion-dust collision is given by

[formula]

In the above expression,

[formula]

are the maximum impact parameter and impact parameter for [formula] scattering for an ion-dust collision.

The neutral drag force is given by[\cite=23],

[formula]

where un is the thermal velocity of the neutrals, [formula] are the dust velocity, mass, density, [formula] is the gas pressure, and β plays the role of friction coefficient. The parameter δ depends on details of the dust-neutral collision and estimated as [formula][\cite=24].

Simplified force model

As we shall see that except the electrostatic force and force due to gravity (assumed to be acting perpendicular to the sheath downward), the other forces are negligibly smaller for the dust in plasma model considered in this paper and can be safely neglected (see below).

We note that in view of the ion-acoustic time scale, the dust particles can be assumed to be stationary and we can assume that ud  ≪  ui and so, the neutral drag force can be neglected. The remaining force is the ion drag force and can be written as (normalized),

[formula]

where the first term inside the '

Conclusions

In this work, we have considered the formation of warm plasma sheath in the vicinity of a wall in an environment with a considerable presence of dust particles. As an example, we have used the parameters relevant in case of lunar plasma sheath, though the results obtained in this work could be applied to any other physical situation such as laboratory plasma. In the ion-acoustic time scale, we have neglected the dust dynamics and thus the dust particle provides a stationary background to the electron-ion plasma. However, the dust particles do affect the sheath dynamics by affecting the Poisson equation which determines the plasma potential in the sheath region. We have assumed that the current to a dust particle remains balanced throughout the sheath formation process. This makes the grain potential dependent on plasma potential, which is then incorporated into the Poisson equation. The resultant numerical model becomes an initial value problem, which is described by a 1-D integro-differential equation, which is then solved self-consistently by incorporating the change in plasma potential caused by inclusion of the dust potential in the Poisson equation. The initial value is given by the plasma potential at the wall determined by the Mach number (equilibrium ion thermal velocity).

We have shown that the presence of massive dust particles inside the sheath region considerably affects the plasma sheath. As dust particles are introduced into the sheath, which may happen naturally in case of space plasma environments and through plasma-wall interactions in laboratory plasmas, they becomes sources of huge collection of negative charges (in this case) requiring more number of ions to neutralise the negative charges while the wall potential remain same. As a result, the sheath becomes thicker. The warm ions helps this process of thickening much like a Debye shielding expanding due to temperature.

We have also considered the phenomenon of levitation of dust particles inside the plasma sheath, which happens due to counteracting electrostatic force and force due to gravity (assuming gravity to be acting perpendicularly downward tom the sheath). Though there may be many other sources of force on a dust particle, they can be neglected in most cases. Bigger dust particles acquire more charges on their surfaces though at the same time get heavier. As a result they may get levitated inside the sheath although the levitation distance (as measured in terms of distance from the wall) may differ depending on the constituent of dust particles. For low Mach numbers, hot ions causes the sheath to expand which pushes the dust particles away from the wall. This effect is like the expansion of Debye shielding cloud expanding due to temperature. For high Mach numbers, however, increase of dust particles inside the sheath prevents this push and they tend to settle down closer to the wall, even when the ions are as hot as electrons. Heavier dust particles always settle down on the wall, which gives rise to a minimum dust size which is required for levitation. Increasing dust density in the plasma sheath restricts the size of levitating dust particles nearer the wall. However, on the average, it pushes up the minimum levitation size. As a result, while due to the effect of dust potential affecting the floating plasma potential in the sheath causes a significant reduction of the levitation distance, the dust distribution becomes broader.

In summary, our analysis provides a generic framework for dust in plasma sheath which could be paramerized to suit laboratory experiments as well as different space and astrophysical environments. To analyse the detailed distribution of levitating dust particles in a plasma sheath in a particular physical scenario, we need to input the respective physical parameters into our analysis. The levitating dust particles in plasma sheath may very well affect results of various plasma processing experiments and the knowledge of detailed dust distribution in plasma sheath is desired to tailor particular needs of experiments.
