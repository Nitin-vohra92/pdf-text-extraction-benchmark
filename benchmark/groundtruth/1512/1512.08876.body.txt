Deligne's conjectures: [formula]-adic theory

Let X be a complex smooth connected variety, let 0  ≠  r,w be natural numbers. Then there are finitely many rank r [formula]-local systems which are direct factors of a [formula]-variation of polarizable pure Hodge structure of weight w.

The inspiration for this finiteness theorem in Hodge theory comes from Faltings's finiteness theorem [\cite=Fal83] for abelian schemes, that is in weight w = 1.

On the other hand, for varieties defined over finite fields, in [formula]-adic theory, one has the following finiteness theorem.

Let X be a smooth separated scheme of finite type defined over a finite field [formula], let 0  ≠  r be a natural number. Let D  ⊂  X̄ be an effective Cartier divisor of a normal compactification X̄ with support [formula]. Then there are finitely many irreducible Weil (resp. étale) rank r lisse [formula]-sheaves with ramification bounded by D, up to twist with Weil (resp. étale) characters of [formula]. The number does not depend on the choice of [formula].

Here 'ramification bounded by D' means that the Swan conductor on the pull-back of the sheaf on any smooth curve mapping non-trivially to X is bounded by the pull-back of D (see [\cite=EK12]). Equivalently one could formulate the finiteness theorem by replacing this notion by the one used by Drinfeld in [\cite=Dri12], counting the sheaves which become tame on a given finite étale cover X'  →  X. That those two notions are equivalent is proved in [\cite=EK12].

Deligne's proof relies on Lafforgue's main theorem which in particular implies Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl] over a smooth curve ([\cite=Laf02]). The whole question, how to reduce to curves, is geometric. Some of the key ideas of the proof go back to Wiesend ([\cite=Wie06] and [\cite=Wie07]).

The chronology is a bit intricate. First Deligne proved its corollary.

Given a lisse étale [formula]-sheaf V with finite determinant, the subfield of [formula] spanned by the eigenvalues of the Frobenii Fx at closed points x∈|X| acting on Vx̄ is a number field.

In fact his direct proof does not request X to be smooth, only to be of finite type. Using this in an essential way, Drinfeld proved the existence of [formula]-adic companions on smooth quasi-projective varieties defined over a finite field [\cite=Dri12], which is part (v) of the conjecture [\cite=Del80]. The conjecture should be valid on X normal. Then, using Drinfeld's theorem in an essential way, Deligne proved Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl].

Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessC] is a theorem on X of dimension 1: fixing a good compactification X̄  ⊃  X, with a strict normal crossings divisor at infinity, then a curve [formula], complete intersection of ample divisors in X̄ in good position, fulfils the Lefschetz theorem on topological fundamental groups, that is the homomorphism

[formula]

is surjective. However, for X of dimension ≥  2 in characteristic p > 0, there is no Lefschetz theorem. Thus Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl] does not obviously reduce to dimension 1.

All one has at disposal are two kinds of Lefschetz theorems, one for reducing all tame coverings of X to one well chosen curve, one for reducing one specific object ([formula]-adic representation or given Galois cover) to one curve adapted to this object.

Let X̄  ⊃  X be a projective normal geometrically connected compactification of a smooth scheme of finite type X defined over a field k, let Σ  ⊂  X̄ be a closed subset of codimension ≥  2 such that [formula] and [formula] are smooth. Let [formula] be a smooth projective curve, complete intersection of ample divisors, meeting [formula] transversally. Then the restriction to [formula] of any finite étale connected cover of [formula], which is tame along [formula], is connected. In particular, the homomorphism on the tame fundamental groups πt1(C)  →  πt1(X) is surjective.

An important point is that one does not need a good compactification for Drinfeld's theorem. If one has one, one can enhance the theorem to a complete version of Lef(X,Y) and Leff(X,Y) Lefschetz theorems (see [\cite=EK15]).

For non-tame [formula]-adic sheaves or covers, only a much weaker version of the Lefschetz theorems is available.

Let X be a smooth quasi-projective variety defined over [formula], let S  ⊂  |X| be a finite set of closed points.

Let V be an irreducible [formula]-Weil or -étale lisse sheaf, then there is a smooth curve C  →  X with S  ⊂  |C|, such that V|C is irreducible.

Let H  ⊂  π1(X) be an open normal subgroup, then there is a smooth curve C  →  X with S  ⊂  |C|, such that the homomorphism π1(C)  →  π1(X) / H is surjective.

Nonetheless, it has the important following consequences.

If  det(V) is torsion, then V has weight 0.

If V is an irreducible Weil lisse [formula]-sheaf with determinant of finite order, and [formula], there is an irreducible Weil lisse [formula]-sheaf Vσ, called the σ- companion of V, with determinant of finite order, such that the characteristic polynomials [formula] of the local Frobenii Fx satisfy fVσ  =  σ(fV).

Deligne's finiteness Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl] for rank 1 sheaves can be proven directly.

Let X be a smooth quasi-projective variety over a perfect field k, let X  ⊂  X̄ be a projective compactification with simple normal crossings at infinity, let D be an effective divisor with support in [formula]. Define πab1(X,D) by the condition that a character [formula] factors through πab1(X,D) if and only if the Artin conductor of χ pulled-back to any curve C  →  X is bounded by the pull-back of D via   →  X̄, where [formula] is a compactification of C, smooth along [formula]. Then the full package of the Lefschetz theorems holds:

for a sufficiently ample divisor i:  ⊂  X̄ in good position with respect to [formula], the homomorphism

[formula]

is an isomorphism if dim Y  ≥  2, and is surjective if dim Y = 1. In particular, if [formula], then

[formula]

is finite.

Theorem [\ref=thm:KS] implies the rank 1 case of Deligne's finiteness Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl] in case one has a good compactification. In fact, one does not need the full package, only that if [formula] is a complete intersection curve of such hypersurfaces [formula] as in the theorem, then

[formula]

is surjective. So far, one does not have tools to understand a version of this for the whole fundamental group, which would explain Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl] in general.

Deligne's conjectures: crystalline theory

Let X be a smooth geometrically connected scheme of finite type over a perfect field k, W: = W(k) be the ring of Witt vectors, K = Frac(W) be its field of fractions. We refer to [\cite=ES15] for the following presentation.

One defines the crystalline sites X / Wn as PD-thickenings [formula], where the coverings come from U  ⊂  X Zariski open. The crystalline site X / W is then the 2-inductive limit of the X / Wn, see [\cite=BO78]. The category of crystals Crys(X / W) is the category of sheaves of OX / W-modules of finite presentation, with transition maps being isomorphisms. It is W-linear. The category of isocrystals [formula] is its [formula]-linearisation. It is K-linear, tannakian.

The absolute Frobenius F acts on [formula]. The largest full subcategory [formula] on which every object is F∞-divisible is the K-tannakian subcategory of convergent isocrystals (Berthelot-Ogus) (Ogus defines the site of enlargements from X / W, then convergent isocrystals are crystals on it of OX / K-modules of finite presentation).

We introduce various categories of F-isocrystals. One defines the category F - Conv(X / K) of convergent F-isocrystals as pairs (E,Φ) where E∈Conv(X / K) and [formula] is a K-linear isomorphism. Its is a [formula]-linear tannakian category. The category F - Overconv(X / K) of overconvergent F-isocrystals, defined analytically by Berthelot in ([\cite=Ber96] (see also [\cite=LeS07]), has a more algebraic description due to Kedlaya. It consists of those convergent F-isocrystals E which have unipotent local monodromy after alteration in the sense of Kedlaya ([\cite=Ked04], [\cite=Ked07]). It is a [formula]-linear category, fully embedded in F - Conv(X / K) ([\cite=Ked04]). We shall just need that if X is proper, then Kedlaya's full embedding is an equivalence, and that the group of extensions of the trivial object by itself in this category is H1rig(X / K), the first rigid cohomology group.

When k is a finite field [formula], one defines [formula] by the same formulae as before, but now Fs acts instead of F. It is a K-linear category. Fixing an algebraic closure p of [formula], one defines F - Overconv(X / K)p as its p-linearization. It is called is the category of overconvergent F-isocrystals over p. See [\cite=Abe13].

With those notations at hand, one can formulate the general hope. For smooth geometrically irreducible schemes of finite type X defined over a finite field [formula], there should be an analogy between

irreducible objects in F - Overconv(X / K)p with finite determinant;

irreducible lisse [formula]-sheaves with finite determinant.

Upon bounding ramification at infinity in i) and ii), the analogy should extend to irreducible [formula]-variations of polarisable pure Hodge structures definable over [formula] over complex varieties.

Let X be a smooth curve defined over a finite field [formula]. Then

an irreducible object in F - Overconv(X / K)p with finite determinant is ι-pure of weight 0;

an irreducible lisse [formula]- étale sheaf with finite determinant has a companion which is an irreducible overconvergent F-isocrystal over p with finite determinant; vice-versa, an irreducible overconvergent F-isocrystal over p with finite determinant has a companion which is an irreducible lisse [formula]- étale sheaf with finite determinant.

Here ι is a fixed isomorphism [formula], and ι-pure means that the Frobenii at all closed points x of X act on the fiber Ex in

[formula]

of the object E in F - Overconv(X / K)p with eigenvalues of complex absolute value qw / 2 for a fixed real number w called the weight. (Similarly, ι-mixed means that E is filtered in F - Overconv(X / K)p such that the associated graded grE in a sum of ι-pure objects. See [\cite=AC13].)

At present, there is no Lefschetz theorem such as Theorem [\ref=thm:bertini] for overconvergent F-isocrystals over p. In particular

one does not know whether irreducible F-isocrystals with finite determinant are ι-pure of weight 0 on smooth quasi-projective varieties over [formula];

a fortiori, one does not have a number field capturing the eigenvalues of [formula] acting on the stalks at closed points [formula] of all irreducible F-isocrystals of bounded rank and bounded ramification with finite determinant;

nor does one have a crystalline version of Deligne's finiteness theorem.

On the crystalline side, we mention [\cite=Kos15] in which a weak analog to Theorem [\ref=thm:finitenessl] is proven: if X is a smooth geometrically connected variety defined over a finite field, then a semi-simple unit-root overconvergent F-isocrystal in F - Overconv(X / K)p is isotrivial. The point is that such an object necessarily is locally isotrivial at infinity, which reduces the problem to the case of X smooth projective, thus by standard Lefschetz to the curve case. One then applies Abe's theorem [\cite=Abe13] which reduces the statement to Lafforgue's theorem [\cite=Laf02]).

Malev-Grothendieck's theorem, Gieseker's conjecture, de Jong's conjecture

Let X be a smooth geometrically irreducible scheme of finite type over field k of characteristic 0. Grothendieck defined the infinitesimal site X∞ ([\cite=Gro68]) with objects [formula] where Y is an infinitesimal thickening of a Zariski open subscheme U, and where coverings come from the Us. Crystals are finitely presented crystals on X∞. The category is equivalent to the category of bundles with an integrable connection [formula] or equivalently to the category of OX-coherent DX-modules. It is a k-linear category, which is tannakian.

Let X be a complex smooth variety. If its étale fundamental group is trivial, then there are no non-trivial crystals in the infinitesimal site (with regular singularities at infinity in case X is not projective).

Here one uses the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence to translate the assertion on representations of groups which are finitely generated, applied to the topological fundamental group, to the assertion on crystals in the infinitesimal site. The proof then just uses that a GL(r,A)-representation, where A is [formula]-algebra of finite type, is trivial if and only if it is by restriction to the closed points of Spec(A).

Gieseker [\cite=Gie75] conjectured that the analog theorem remains true in characteristic p > 0. Let X be a smooth projective geometrically irreducible variety over a field k of characteristic p > 0. One defines X∞ and crystals as in characteristic 0. By Katz' theorem [\cite=Gie75], which relies on Cartier descent, it is also equivalent to the category of Frobenius divisible OX-coherent sheaves, that is infinite sequences [formula] of bundles En on the n-th Frobenius twist X(n) of X, together with isomorphisms σn between En and the Frobenius pull-back of En + 1. Then Gieseker's conjecture predicts that Theorem [\ref=thm:MG] holds in characteristic p > 0. It has been proved in 2010:

Let X be a smooth projective geometrically irreducible variety over a field k of characteristic p > 0. If its geometric étale fundamental group is trivial, then there are no non-trivial crystals in the infinitesimal site.

What in the proof replaces the finite generation of the topological fundamental group is the existence of quasi-projective moduli for stable bundles with vanishing Chern classes (Langer, [\cite=Lan04]). What then replaces the criterion for triviality is Hrushovski's theorem on the existence of preperiodic points on dominant correspondences over finite fields. Varshavsky in [\cite=Var14] gave a proof of it in the framework of arithmetic geometry, without using model theory.

One can formulate variants of Gieseker's conjecture. If X is not proper, then the theory of regular singular crystals in the infinitesimal site has been developed by Kindler [\cite=Kin15], in such a way that for those objects with a finite Tannaka group, it coincides with the notion of tame quotient of the étale fundamental group. There is no good higher ramification theory so far, nor does one have an analog of Theorem [\ref=thm:EM], except for the tame abelian quotient of the geometric fundamental group (Kindler, [\cite=Kin13]), and in the case where X is the smooth locus of a normal projective variety defined over k = q (Esnault-Srinivas [\cite=ESB15]; the proof uses Bost's improvement of Grothendieck's LEF theorem, see [\cite=ESB15]).

In 2010, de Jong formulated the corresponding conjecture in the category of isocrystals. Let X be a smooth projective geometrically irreducible variety over a perfect field k of characteristic p > 0. If its geometric étale fundamental group is trivial, then the conjecture predicts that there are no non-trivial isocrystals. As of today, there is no complete understanding of the conjecture. We now list the know results concerning it.

One defines N(1) =   ∞  ,N(2) = 2,N(3) = 1,N(r) = 1 / M(r) where for any natural number r  ≥  4, M(r) is the maximum of the lower common multiples of a and b for all choices of natural numbers a,b  ≥  1 with a + b  ≤  r. For any torsion-free coherent sheaf F, one denotes by μ max(F) its maximal slope.

Let X be a smooth projective geometrically irreducible variety over a perfect field k of characteristic p > 0.

If the abelian quotient of the geometric étale fundamental group of X is trivial, there are no non-trivial isocrystals which are successive extensions of rank 1 isocrystals. ([\cite=ES15]).

If the geometric étale fundamental group of X is trivial, μ max(Ω1X) < N(r), the irreducible constituents of the Jordan-Hölder filtration of E have rank ≤  r, and E itself is either in Conv(X / K) or else each of his irreducible constituents has a locally free lattice and has rank ≥  r, then E is trivial. ([\cite=ES15] and [\cite=ES15b]).

Let f:Y  →  X be a smooth proper morphism between smooth proper schemes of finite type.

If the geometric étale fundamental group of X is trivial, then all the Gauß-Manin convergent isocrystals Rnf*OY / K are trivial. If k is finite, f is projective and p  ≥  3, one can drop the properness assumption on X ([\cite=ES15b]).

We first discuss 3). Le us assume that k is a finite field. Then the statement relies on

Let X be a smooth scheme of finite type defined over a finite field k. If E and E' are ι-mixed overconvergent F-isocrystals over p with the same set of Frobenius eigenvalues on closed points of X. Then the semi-simplifications of E and E' are isomorphic.

When X is proper or f is projective, the convergent F-isocrystal Rnf*OY / K is an overconvergent F-isocrystal over p via the faithful embedding ([\cite=Laz15]), thus obeys Theorem [\ref=thm:cebotarev]. The Weil conjectures [\cite=KM74], [\cite=CLS98] in the proper case, enable one to conclude that the semi-simplification of Rnf*OY / K is constant. Forgetting the F-structure, it is thus a successive extension of the trivial overconvergent isocrystal by itself, thus is trivial, as the first rigid cohomology of X is controlled by the first [formula]-adic cohomology of [formula] when X is proper or p  ≥  3. The latter is trivial if the geometric fundamental group is trivial. Over a general field k, the properness assumption on X allows to compare the statement to the one over finite fields by base change.

We discuss 2). Since the conjecture concerns isocrystals, it is not natural to try to argue with lattices, that is p-torsion free crystals E in a given isocrystal class E. Unfortunately, there is at present no other way to do, and indeed, basically 2) is proven by showing that under the given assumptions, the value EX on X of a well chosen crystal E in the isocrystal class E is trivial. Then one studies the possible liftings modulo p-powers. In order to show triviality of EX, one applies Theorem [\ref=thm:EM]. To do so, one has to show the existence of such an EX which is semi-stable with vanishing numerical Chern classes, so as to be able to define its moduli point. If EX was F∞-divisible, then one could apply Theorem [\ref=thm:EM] directly. This is not the case, even if E∈Conv(X / K), that is even if E is F∞-divisible. Instead, one shows that Fa-divisibility is enough to trivialize a moduli point, for a large enough depending only on X and the rank of E ([\cite=ES15]). One applies this to the Frobenius pull-backs of EX. For this one needs that they are semistable as well, and this is the reason for the assumption on μ max(Ω1X). On the other hand, a Langton type argument guarantees that one finds a crystal E such that EX is semi-stable. The issue is then to show vanishing of the Chern classes of EX. It is easy to show that all lattices EX of a given isocrystal E have the same crystalline Chern classes ccrysn(E) in H2n(X / W),n  ≥  1, and thus ccrysn(E) = 0 if E∈Conv(X / K) ([\cite=ES15]). If EX is locally free as a coherent sheaf, it is true, but by no means trivial, that ccrysn(E) = 0, where E is the isocrystal class of E (see [\cite=ES15b]). However, we do not know whether or not any isocrystal E admits a lattice E which is locally free. This explains the restriction on the type of isocrystals considered in the theorem.
