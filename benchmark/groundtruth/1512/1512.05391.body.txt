Long-range Response in AC Electricity Grids

Power grids provide eletrical power to billions of individuals reliably. For example, in germany the average outage time experienced by a consumer in 2006 was 20 minutes and continued to decrease in the last decade to 12.5 minutes in 2014 [\cite=bundesnetzagentur]. Still, the energy transition towards an increased supply of decentralized renewable energy raises concerns that the change from the previously centralised power production with unidirectional power flow towards a decentralised electrical power system with bidirectional flow might be harmful for the stability of electricity grids. Disturbances and power outages might spread more easily in highly connected grids and cause nonlocal disturbances, which may cause larger instabilities of the entire grid. Therefore, it is essential to get a better understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to nonlocal disturbances and how their spreading depends on the connectivity and topology of the grid.

In a previous work, the long-range response to the addition of another transmission line for the case of a DC grid including losses by Joule heating has been studied [\cite=Labavic2014]. It has been demonstrated that the absolute change of transmitted power as function of the distance to the perturbation follows a power law. Real power transmission grids usually use three-phasic alternating current (AC) [\cite=Heuck2013]. Hence, we are going to perform a similar analysis for AC networks.

An electrical power transmission system can formally be described as a (multi)graph G that consists of nodes i,j∈N (substations) and edges (i,j)∈E (transmission lines), where N is the set of all nodes and E the set of all edges of G. The network model gains its physical meaning by defining appropriate node and edge attributes. Starting from the Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law, it is straighforward to write down the steady state power flow equations for a three-phase AC network,

[formula]

where the three alternating currents of the same frequency are phase shifted by 120 degrees. Here, Si  =  Pi  +  iQi is the net generated power entering the network at node i (negative for a consumer, positive for a generator), and Vi is the terminal voltage of the machine connected at node i. Yij is the admittance of the transmission line (i,j) [\cite=conj]. For a transmission line in an arbitrary AC network, the labeling is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:ac-grid].

If we restrict ourselves to a purely inductive grid (no Joule heating),

[formula]

we can assume sinusoidal voltages with a constant magnitude [formula] [\cite=Kettemann2015],

[formula]

with phase angles φi(ω,t)  =  ωt  +  θi(t). Thus only the phase difference between adjacent nodes can give rise for an electrical current. We are looking for steady states with constant grid frequency ω (e.g. [formula]). The power capacity of a transmission line (a set of three wires) is given by

[formula]

So the power flow equations [\eqref=eq:powflow] become

[formula]

The real part gives the balance of the active power flow,

[formula]

which determines the phases θi at all nodes for given power Pi. The imaginary part of Eq. [\eqref=eq:powflow2] gives the balance of the reactive power Qi. For the constant voltage amplitudes considered in this article, the N active power equations determine the N phases φi which fix the reactive power at node i, Qi.

If there exists a stationary solution θi for the chosen system parameters, it can easily be found using some standard root-finding algorithm [\cite=root], see Fig. [\ref=fig:flow-phase] for an example. Given a solution for the phase distribution θi, the transmitted power Fij from node i to node j is given by

[formula]

as plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:flow-flow], where the thickness of the arrows is proportional to |Fij|.

Then we add a single line to the graph and calculate the modified transmitted powers F'ij (see Fig. [\ref=fig:flow2-flow]). We then calculate the difference ΔFij  =  F'ij  -  Fij and study the average absolute difference 〈|ΔFij|〉 of all edges as a function of their distance to the added line (see Fig. [\ref=fig:flow2-diff]). The average covers all edges with the same distance r to the added line as well as an ensemble average over R  =  1000 disorder realizations (random distributions for the Pi).

We first consider a regular 2D grid graph of linear size L with cyclic boundary conditions, so the system size (number of nodes) is given by N  =  L2. In this graph it is particularly simple to define a measure for the distance between two edges by counting the number of edges that have to be passed (shortest path), as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:distance]. We further consider a binary distribution for the nodal net generated power Pi, where nodes with Pi  =   + P are regarded as generators and nodes with Pi  =   - P as consumers. We set the power capacity of all lines to Kij  =  K, so we can note down all power quantities in units of K. In order to find a stable solution, the condition [formula] must be fulfilled at all times, which rules out the possibility of odd linear sizes L.

In order to precisely control the amount of disorder in the system, we use the following procedure to generate a random distribution of the Pi: We start from a periodic arrangement of generators and consumers [\cite=antiferro] and divide the graph into two subgraphs, one carrying all N / 2 generators and the other all N / 2 consumers. Then, p different nodes are chosen randomly from each subgraph, forming p generator-consumer pairs. Finally, each of these generator-consumer pairs is swapped. By generating a permutation of the periodic arrangement in this way, it is ensured that no node is swapped twice, and the amount of disorder w∈[0,1] is precisely defined as

[formula]

depending on the number of swapped generator-consumer pairs p. The maximally disordered state is reached after p max  =  N / 4 swaps. There is a finite number of possible realizations, given by the ensemble size

[formula]

which is however very large for the considered system sizes.

To study the long-range response of the grid to the added transmission line, we classify all edges of the graph by their distance r to the new edge by counting the number of edges that link the considered edge to the new edge (see Fig. [\ref=fig:distance] for an illustration). We average the change in the amplitude of the transmitted power |ΔFij| over all edges with the same distance r to the added line, and perform an ensemble average 〈|ΔFij|〉(r) over R  =  1000 realizations with the same disorder strength w. Realizations for which no steady state solution can be found are skipped. This happens in particular if the transmitted power Fij is exceeding the capacity Kij of at least one transmission line (i,j) so that Eq. [\eqref=eq:powtransmit] cannot be fulfilled since sin (θi  -  θj)  >  Fij / Kij. For the square grid, the power capacity K has to exceed the critical value Kc  =  P  /  4 in order to obtain a steady state power flow at all [\cite=kc]. Since for a random arrangement of Pi larger clusters of Nc generators or consumers can occur with total power NcP, the lines connected to these clusters can be overloaded even if the power capacity exceeds the critical value K  >  Kc, and no steady state solution is found. Thus, only a certain subset of realizations leads to a solution for the θi.

〈|ΔFij|〉(r) has been calculated for different linear system sizes L and plotted on a double-logarithmic scale in Fig. [\ref=fig:scaling]. Up to a certain distance rsat, 〈|ΔFij|〉 is a steadily decreasing function of r. The value rsat is found to depend on system size L. For distances r exceeding rsat (region R4), the data saturates, or even a small increase is noticable, which is probably an effect caused by the cyclic boundary conditions. For distances r  <  rsat we are able to identify two regimes R1 and R2 that both show a power-law-like behavior of 〈|ΔFij|〉(r), but with different power exponents b. Beyond R2, close to rsat, there is a region where the data deviates somewhat from a pure power law behavior (region R3).

For the regimes R1 and R2 we fit the data to a power law, using the fit model

[formula]

The fit results are shown in Tab. [\ref=tab:scaling1] (R1) and Tab. [\ref=tab:scaling2] (R2). To assess the quality of the fit, we compute the χ2 statistic and the goodness of fit probability Q [\cite=gof]. For each fit, we choose an optimal range (r min,r max) so that Q is closest to 0.5. Thus, the number of considered data points is ND  =  r max  -  r min  +  1. For the error bars, 95  % confidence intervals are considered.

Due to the small number of data points at small distances r, the fit quality in regime R1 is not acceptable. Thus, we are not able to quantitatively prove the existence of a power law in regime R1, despite the qualitative indications.

In regime R2, there are more data points (increasing with system size), since the number of nodes at a certain distance r increases with distance, so the standard error becomes smaller. The fit quality is found to be mostly optimal and the power exponent b can be determined with high accuracy. Thus, we find clear evidence that the reaction of an AC power transmission grid to a local modification of the topology is of long-ranged nature, decaying with a power law with distance r with exponent b.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:bl], we analyze the system size dependence of the power exponent b in regime R2. The data suggests a saturation of b in the limit of large system sizes. We find the largest b  =  1.812  ±  0.017 for a linear system size of L  =  80, when the power is set to P / K  =  0.25. Remarkably, we do not find a significant dependece of the power exponent b on the ratio P / K for these system sizes. A dependence on P / K could have been expected, since the larger P / K, the smaller are the allowed changes ΔFij when adding the additional transmission line. Therefore, one could have expected that the response becomes more long-ranged, corresponding to smaller powers b, when increasing P / K. However, no such tendency can be confirmed for the studied P / K ratios. We note here that we fixed the amount of disorder in the system to the maximal value w  =  1.

In contrast to the power exponent b, the preexponential a in Eq. [\eqref=eq:powerlaw] increases with P / K linearly, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:al]. This behavior is expected, since the addition of a transmission line with power capacity K will lead to a redistribution of the power flow in proportion to the generated power P / K, so that 〈|ΔFij|〉  ~  P / K is expected on average.

We also analyze the value of 〈|ΔFij|〉(r) as function of system size L for the smallest distance r = 0, the largest distance r = L - 2 and at the value r  =  rsat, where 〈|ΔFij|〉 starts to saturate, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fss-F]. The dependence on L is qualitatively following a power law, g(L)  =  e  +  cL- d. The fit results are summarized in Tab. [\ref=tab:fss-F] and visualized in Fig. [\ref=fig:fss-F], setting e  =  0. We find a different power exponent d in the small distance regime at r = 0 than in the limit of large distances r = L - 2. The low fit quality shows that either the data does not follow a pure power law (with e  =  0), or that the statistical error of the data (standard error of the mean) has been underestimated.

Having verified the long-range response of local grid modifications in AC electricity grids, a comparison of the results to an earlier study considering long-range response in DC grids [\cite=Labavic2014] is in place. In the DC case also two power-law regimes R1 and R2 have been found, but in contrast to AC results, the exponent b does not increase but decrease when going from R1 to R2. Also the absolute values of the exponents b are different in AC and DC grids, finding for or a linear system size of L  =  50 in regime R2 b  =  1.32 [\cite=Labavic2014] for DC and [formula] for AC.

In order to move towards more realistic grid structures, we show in the following preliminary results using a model for the German transmission grid [\cite=scigrid]. To be able to compare to the results for the 2D grid, we only change the topology. All other assumptions stay intact, in particular the constant power capacity Kij  =  K and the binary generator distribution Pi∈{ - P,P}. Also the distance r to the added line is measured by simply counting edges as before.

The first difference to the 2D grid is that the choice (location) of the added line influences the results, so we have to study different line locations separately. To exemplify this, we add two example lines that connect nodes with a high betweenness centrality cB, as we think that this choice could lead to results most similar to those of the 2D grid topology. Fig. [\ref=fig:flow-germany] shows how a single line addition changes the flows throughout the German grid (for a single distribution of generators). Fig. [\ref=fig:scaling-distance-ger] shows the result for the function 〈|ΔFij|〉(r) for the two added lines. It proves that adding different lines in different locations can lead to both different magnitude and shape of the outcoming response. Remarkably, the values are not monotonically decreasing anymore.

To conclude, we have shown numerically that local grid modifications - in this special case the addition of a single transmission line - cause a long-range response in AC electricity grids. This finding can also be relevant for other types of perturbations, for example fluctuations in the power production of small, decentrally placed generators (photovoltaics, wind power), as small changes in the generated power or small phase perturbations can have an impact on the stable operation of a large part of the grid. In a conventional energy grid, the largest consumers (industry) as well as the largest generators usually consist of large rotating masses, so small perturbations are easily smoothed out. As of the energy transition towards an increasingly decentral power generation, generators that do not possess this kind of buffer of electrical energy in form of inertia - namely photovoltaic cells - produce an increasing share of the energy supply. This study should be extended to other topologies like random graphs and in particular real world topologies, eventually also including real line parameters and power distributions. Furthermore, the analysis could be extended to the complete AC power flow equations, including the reactive power Qi. Ultimately, this approach could lead to quantitative predictions if a particular grid extension measure improves or diminishes the overall stability of the electricity grid.
