DRAFT: Evaluation of Cellular Solids Derived from Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces

INTRODUCTION

Cellular solids are a class of materials composed of an interconnected network of struts and plates, which form the edges and faces of cells that tesselate three-dimensional space [\cite=Ashby:2006aa]. The geometry of these cells can be represented by the constituent polyhedra in a convex uniform honeycomb. There are 28 such honeycombs [\cite=grunbaum1994uniform], and common examples of the derived frameworks include the Kelvin lattice, the Octet lattice, and the CubOctahedral lattice.

Cellular solids are found in many forms in nature, and have been applied in many engineering problems, including the construction of ultralight structural materials [\cite=gibson1997cellular] [\cite=cheung2013reversibly]. The most important characteristic of these solids is the relative density ρ*  /  ρ, which relates many of the global properties of the cellular solid to the bulk material from which the solid is derived [\cite=Ashby:2006aa]. Some of these properties, modulus and ultimate strength, depend on the geometry chosen to represent the cellular solid.

For instance, in geometries where there is sufficient coordination between the frame elements that loads are transferred axially, such as in the octet lattice, the foam is said to be “stretch-dominated” and the Young’s modulus of the material is directly proportional to the relative density. In geometries where there is insufficient coordination, such as in the Kelvin lattice, loads are transmitted between the struts through bending, so the foam is said to be “bending-dominated”, and the Young’s modulus of the materials is quadratically proportional to the relative density [\cite=Ashby:2006aa]. Furthermore, the range of behaviors that can be reached by varying the geometry is not limited to these two; coordinated-buckling modes such as those in the cuboctahedral lattice can impart a mixed stretch-bending behavior to load transfer, and therefore the resulting Young’s modulus is proportional to the relative density to the 3 / 2 power [\cite=cheung2013reversibly].

Recent work in digital cellular solids introduced a decomposition of the cuboctahedral lattice into a single, two-dimensional part, which was then reversibly assembled into structures with, at the time, unprecedented strength-for-weight [\cite=cheung2013reversibly]. This work showcased many desirable traits to the scalable assembly of cellular solids, including centimeter-scale construction, repairability, and mass-production of parts from high-performance materials [\cite=cheung2012digital]. Subsequent work has demonstrated further capabilities of this approach, including robotic traversal[\cite=MOJO] and meter-scale structures [\cite=yosemite] using a three-part strut-node construction.

However, in both digital and conventional cellular solids, the geometry that is conventionally used for modeling a manufactured foam or as the basis for a digital decomposition is one that has been generated from a convex uniform honeycomb. While it is clearly justified for studying the theoretical behavior of stretch- versus bending- dominated foams, the structures derived from convex uniform honeycombs have nodes (points where the struts of the cellular solid meet) that are three-dimensional. This therefore makes the problem of decomposing such a lattice into two-dimensional parts, as is the custom with digital cellular solids, non-trivial.

Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces

An alternative approach to using convex uniform polyhedra in the design of digital cellular solids is to find periodic frameworks whose node geometries are simpler, but whose performance is comparable to existing geometries.

Triply periodic minimal surfaces are embedded surfaces that are translationally invariant in three orthogonal directions [\cite=karcher1996construction]. These objects have many advantageous properties as a generator of periodic frameworks for cellular solids. Since they are non self-intersecting surfaces, all lines on the surface will meet on a locally flat plane. If these lines are taken as the struts of a periodic framework, and the nodes as the intersections between the lines, then the complexity of these nodes is greatly reduced compared to equivalent-connectivity structure generated from the edges and vertices of a convex uniform polyhedral honeycomb. Additionally, since TPMS are triply periodic, a framework found for a single unit cell will also be periodic and therefore an appropriate geometry for a cellular solid.

This paper seeks to apply the analytical tools originally developed for studying cellular solids to frameworks generated from triply periodic minimal surfaces. It discusses a method for deriving a periodic framework from a TPMS, and then studies the theoretical static performance of this framework compared to conventional cellular solids.

Beam Bending Models

The large-scale mechanical behavior of cellular solids has been successfully modelled analytically by treating the struts that compose the solid as Euler-Bernoulli beams [\cite=Ashby:2006aa]. This treatment has resulted in the identification of multiple distinct behaviors for different lattices depending on how global loads are transferred to the beams, including stretch-dominated, bending-dominated, and stretch-bend modes. These modes depend on the coordination of the lattice, or how many struts meet at each node, and allow measurable properties such as modulus and ultimate strength to be related to the relative density.

The logical extension of this analytical treatment is the use of structural analysis software that directly simulates a cellular solid at the strut level using the Euler-Bernoulli beam-bending model. Existing work has shown that this approach is both faster and more accurate than simulating the cellular solids with many small mesh elements. [\cite=calisch2014physical].

Methodology

A TPMS can be represented in a variety of ways. When first discovered, examples were generated using the Enneper-Weierstrau formulas [\cite=karcher1996construction], which parametrize the minimal surface in the complex domain. The complexity of this representation limited its usefulness, and even today only a few such representations of various TPMS are known. Later, Shoen used interpenetrating skeletal graphs with specific crystallographic symmetry to visualize a wide variety of TPMS [\cite=schoen1970infinite]. However, it wasn’t until Karcher proved their mathematical existence using the conjugate surface method that they gained traction in the mathematical community [\cite=karcher1989triply].

The conjugate surface method takes advantage of a fundamental observation of minimal surfaces- every minimal surface belongs to an associate or Bonnet family, where a single family parameter φt∈{0,2π} can produce a continuous range of surfaces [\cite=karcher1989triply]. In addition to generating an infinite variety of minimal surfaces through variation of the family parameter, this method guarantees a minimal patch that can be converted to a periodic framework, as shown in the section below.

In the natural sciences, implicit approximations of the TPMS have been used instead of the explicit forms [\cite=gandy2001nodal], in order to save computational overhead. In particular, the use of periodic nodal surfaces have satisfactorily reproduced the most famous TPMS without extending beyond the leading term of the series, and even higher order approximations have resulted in even better fidelity.

Finding the Periodic Frameworks

The periodic frameworks that can be derived from a given TPMS are the embedded straight lines of the surface. A general method for finding these lines will allow the literally infinite variety of TPMS to act as generators for periodic frameworks.

An analytical approach for finding such lines is to use the conjugate surface method to solve the free boundary problem for the asymmetric unit of the conjugate TPMS. The resulting decomposition of the polyhedral asymmetric unit into the polygon boundary of the desired surface produces the set of straight lines that can then be taken as the primitive unit of the periodic framework [\cite=karcher1996construction].

For example, to find the periodic framework for the P-Schwarz surface, we would start with the asymmetric unit of its conjugate surface, the D-Schwarz. This unit is a tetragonal disphenoid, or an isohedral tetrahedron with isosceles triangle faces [\cite=gandyexactD]. This unit then forms the set of planes that the free boundary will be solved on by constructing a conjugate polygonal contour, through a process described by Karcher and Polthier [\cite=karcher1996construction]. This contour forms the boundary of the minimal patch for the P-Schwarz, which can be transformed through the symmetries of the P-Schwarz’ point group to produce the surface [\cite=karcher1989triply]. The lines which form the polygonal boundary of this minimal patch are the embedded periodic framework of the surface.

This method, however, only works for TPMS of low genus [\cite=gandy2001nodal], since larger genus structures introduce unknown degrees of freedom that must be balanced to avoid self-intersections. There is no general theorem to solve this so-called period problem, and so the applicability of this method is limited [\cite=karcher1996construction].

A numerical approach can also be employed to find the straight lines. This approach has the advantages of being general- all that is required is an implicit approximation of the surface. A downside of the approach, however, is that the existence of the straight lines cannot be ascertained using this method.

Begin with a TPMS with an implicit approximation [formula], defined inside a unit cell [formula]

Choose two faces of the unit cell, and define a curve on each of these faces, C1and C2, which represent the intersection between the TPMS and the chosen unit cell face

For each point [formula] on C1, we define a vector [formula] between that point and every point [formula] on C2, [formula]

If [formula] for all t∈{0,1}, then the pair [formula] represents an embedded line on the surface.

Repeat for all pairs of surfaces

We apply this approach to the P- and D-Schwarz surfaces, using a numerical method that splits the boundary curves of each of the sides into 1000 points, and assesses 10 equally-spaced points along the length of each test line to see if it is embedded. The set of lines is shown in Figure [\ref=figure_frame]. Furthermore, inspection of these lines shows additional intersections that aren’t apparent from the numerical algorithm, but are explicitly defined in the polygonal contours found with the analytical approach.

Finally, we apply the discrete algorithm to the Gyroid, which is known as one of the rare TPMS with neither straight lines nor mirror planes [\cite=gandyexactG], and find that the numerical approach finds no such lines even with a much higher resolution.

Analysis

Inspection of the frameworks derived from the P- and D-Schwarz surfaces shows that they are composed of four sets of interpenetrated isogrid lattices whose pitch is four times the length of a single strut. These lattices intersect at the midpoints of the isogrid elements in the D-Schwarz geometry, and at the first and third quarter of the isogrid elements in the P-Schwarz geometry. This results in a different node geometry for the two frameworks- 2/5 of the nodes in the P-Schwarz framework have connectivity 6 and the other 3/5 connectivity 4, while the D-Schwarz has only nodes with connectivity 6.

Applying Calladine's extension of Maxwell's counting rules for three-dimensional structures [\cite=calladine1989theory], the P-Schwarz structure contains mechanism states (M = -6) while the D-Schwarz has no mechanism (M = 6).

As an initial test of the structural performance, we constructed a tool for simulating cellular solids through a finite element beam solver, which allowed us to relate a set of applied forces [formula] to a set of displacements [formula] via a stiffness matrix K. The original inspiration and reference for this tool was the Frame3dd program [\cite=gavin2010frame3dd], and among the many modifications to the original code was a rewritten stiffness matrix solver that used the CHOLMOD algorithm [\cite=davis2005cholmod] [\cite=andersen2013cvxopt], which is designed to efficiently invert sparse, positive-definite matrices like K. In this model, each strut in the cellular solid is treated as a frame element, capable of transmitting axial forces and bending moments to the nodes.

For this test, the cellular solid articles consisted of the base unit cell tessellated to fill a cubic volume. The modulus of the simulated material constituting the beams was 3 GPa, the pitch of the unit cell was 0.1016 m, and the beams had a square cross section with side length d. After performing a convergence calculation, we found that the optimal size for the article was 1.016 m, resulting in a test article that consisted of a [formula] array of unit cells, and a modulus that was 90% of the converged value.

Using these settings, we simulated four geometries: the Kelvin lattice (with expected quadratic performance), the Octet lattice (with expected linear performance), the P-Schwarz, and the D-Schwarz. For each lattice, we varied the relative density between 0.0001 and 0.1. The volume fraction consisting of the volume of all the struts composing a cellular solid over the volume V that the cellular solid occupies approximates this relative density. That is,

[formula]

Where ρ*  /  ρ is the relative density, N is the number of struts in the solid, and Le is the length of the strut for the chosen geometry.

With this defined, we added an additional layer of material that had the same geometry but a modulus of 3000 GPa and sixteen times the relative density to the top of the article in order to approximate a rigid plate. We then applied an evenly distributed compressive force F to the top of this plate, and measured the resulting deflection in the top most nodes of the plate. This deflection was the basis for our modulus calculation:

[formula]

Where A is the cross-sectional area of the article, h is the height of the article (not including the "plate"), and [formula] is the mean displacement of the topmost layer of nodes.

The finite-element code cannot, in its current state, model the post-buckling behavior of the structure- after buckling, the stiffness matrix is no longer positive-definite and not solvable with CHOLMOD. We addressed this limitation by choosing a load that was well within the expected ultimate strength of the structure, so that the expected strain was also linear. In addition, to address the possibility of non-physical stability in the structure, we also included a small jitter to each of the nodes. This took the form of a randomly-oriented displacement vector of length d applied to each node.

Figure [\ref=figure_den] shows the performance of all three cellular solids as the density is varied. One inaccuracy to note is that, as the relative density of the simulated structure increases, the measured modulus begins to vastly underestimate the material modulus. The reason for this underestimation concerns the cellular solids treatment of material, which is considered accurate for relative densities below 0.1 [\cite=gibson1997cellular].

Discussion

The simulated behavior of both structures indicates that their response to an applied load is equivalent that of a stretch-dominated lattice. This linear relationship between relative modulus and relative density is normally attributed to the far more complex Octet truss, which has coordination 12 and is much harder to decompose into two-dimensional parts.

A Digital Design

While finding the periodic framework for a given TPMS is decidedly less trivial than finding a framework for a given convex uniform polyhedron honeycomb, the reverse is true for generating a digital decomposition of that framework. Because the node geometry of the TPMS lattices are confined to a two-dimensional plane, the decomposition is straightforward, and one such decomposition is shown in Figure [\ref=figure_parts].

Using this design, the D-Schwarz can be constructed out of a library of two parts: a part with six-fold symmetry, 3 arms and 3 slots, and pins for attaching the arms to a neighboring part's slot. The P-Schwarz can be constructed from three parts consisting of the two used for the D-Schwarz, and an additional adapter plate with four-fold symmetry consisting of two arms and two slots. Figure [\ref=figure_model] shows one such structure constructed out of laser-cut 3 / 32" Acetal Delrin.

An astute observer will note that, while the nodal geometry is locally flat, a two-dimensional part that composes TMPS framework will have to twist [formula] with the P-Schwarz and [formula] for the D-Schwarz. One solution involves constructing parts with this twist pre-defined, so that there is no pre-stress imposed on the structure. Future experimental work will be devoted to seeing whether this moment has an effect on the performance of the structure.
