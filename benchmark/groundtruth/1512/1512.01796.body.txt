Symmetric decompositions of free Kleinian groups and hyperbolic displacements

Introduction

The following is sequel to Yüce [\cite=Y] in which the machinery developed by Culler and Shalen [\cite=CSParadox] that gives a lower bound for the maximum of the displacements under the generators of Γ is extended to calculate a lower bound for the maximum of the displacements under any finite set of isometries in Γ in connection with the solutions of certain minimax problems with a constraint. Here Γ is a Kleinian group generated by two non-commuting isometries ξ and η of [formula] that satisfies the hypothesis of the log 3 Theorem which can be stated as follows:

The use of this extension for the set of isometries [formula] implies, for instance, the fact that [formula] for any [formula] [\cite=Y].

Since it has implications on Margulis numbers and volume estimates for a large class of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the log 3 theorem is the main tool or motivation behind many deep results that connect the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to their geometry (see Agol-Culler-Shalen [\cite=ACS], Culler-Hersonski-Shalen [\cite=CHS], Culler-Shalen [\cite=CSParadox] [\cite=CSBetti] [\cite=CSMargulis]). For example, if M is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold whose first Betti number b1(M) is at least 4 and the fundamental group π1(M) of M has no subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group of a genus two surface, then a generalization of the log 3 theorem due to Anderson-Canary-Culler-Shalen [\cite=ACCS] implies that 0.5 log 5 is a Margulis number for M and, 3.08 is a lower bound for the volume of M. In [\cite=CSParadox], as well as proving the log 3 Theorem, Culler and Shalen show that 0.5 log 3 is a Margulis number and, 0.92 is a lower bound for the volume of M if b1(M)  ≥  3 and π1(M) has no subgroup of finite index. In [\cite=CHS], Culler, Hersonsky and Shalen increase the previous lower bound for M to 0.94. It must be noted that the lower volume estimates computed in [\cite=ACCS] and [\cite=CSParadox] are improved by the works of Calegari-Meyerhoff-Milley [\cite=DRP] and Milley [\cite=Mil] in which a newer method called Mom technology was introduced.

Aiming to set the ground work to investigate the further applications of the methods developed in [\cite=ACS] [\cite=CHS] [\cite=ACCS] [\cite=CSParadox] [\cite=CSBetti] [\cite=CSMargulis] to improve on the Margulis numbers and volume estimates for the classes of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds mentioned in the previous paragraph, in this paper we shall prove the following:

Theorem [\ref=thm4.1] If Γk is the set of isometries of length at most k  ≥  2 in Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉, then we have [formula] for any [formula],

which is given as in . This theorem can be considered as a generalization of the log 3 theorem for symmetric subsets of isometries, which will be made clear in , in Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉.

In the rest of this manuscript, we shall assume, unless otherwise is stated, that Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 has the properties given in the log 3 theorem. The expression S∞ will denote the boundary of the canonical compactification [formula] of [formula]. Note that [formula]. The notation ΛΓ  ·  z will denote the limit set of Γ-orbit of [formula] on S∞. We will express the hyperbolic displacement of [formula] under the action of the isometry [formula] by dist(z,γ  ·  z).

The proof of requires the use of the strategy carried out by Culler and Shalen in the proof of the log 3 theorem together with the solution method explained in [\cite=Y] to certain minimax problems which produce the lower bounds given in the theorem. In particular, the proof entails the examination of two cases:

. when Γ is geometrically infinite; that is, ΛΓ  ·  z = S∞ for every [formula],

. when Γ is geometrically finite.

Before we summarize the proof of in each case, we introduce some notation. Let z0 be a given point in [formula]. By [\cite=CSParadox], the group Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is free on the generators ξ and η. As a consequence, Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 can be decomposed as

[formula]

for each k  ≥  2. In ([\ref=symm.d.]) Ψkr is the set of all words of length less than k and Ψk is the set of all words of length exactly k in Γ. The expression Jψ is the set of words in Γ which starts with the word ψ∈Ψk.

The set Ψk, which can be considered as [formula], will be given an ordering. Above Ψkγ denotes the set of words in Ψk starting with γ∈{ξ,η- 1,η,ξ- 1}. From left to right, elements of Ψk will be listed so that reduced words starting with ξ are in the first group, words starting with η- 1 are in the second, words starting with η are in the next and finally words starting with ξ- 1 are in the last group. In each group, from left to right, each letter of each reduced word will keep the same order, eg for k = 2, we have Ψ2  =  {ξ2,ξη- 1,ξη,η- 1ξ- 1,η- 1ξ,η- 2,η2,ηξ- 1,ηξ,ξ- 1η- 1,ξ- 1η,ξ- 2}.

We enumerate the elements of Ψk as follows: Assign 1 to the first word of Ψk which ends with ξ. Every other word which ends with ξ in Ψk will be assigned positive integers which are equivalent to 1 in modulo 4 in increasing order. Assign 2 to the second word of Ψk which ends with η- 1. For the other words which end with η- 1, assign positive integers in increasing order equivalent to 2 in modulo 4. Repeat this process with 3 and 4 for η and ξ- 1, respectively. We shall abuse the notation and for each k  ≥  2 we shall denote these enumerations with the mapping

[formula]

For Ψ2, for instance, we get [formula], ξη- 1  ↦  2, ξη  ↦  3, η- 1ξ- 1  ↦  4, η- 1ξ  ↦  5, η- 2  ↦  6, η2  ↦  7, ηξ- 1  ↦  8, ηξ  ↦  9, ξ- 1η- 1  ↦  10, ξ- 1η  ↦  11, and ξ- 2  ↦  12. We shall also need the enumeration [formula] given below for k = 3: For i = 1,2,3,4 we have p(Ψγ) = Ii for γ∈{ξ,η,η- 1,ξ- 1}, where, by abusing the notation, we let [formula].

Let us say [formula]. Each decomposition, denoted by ΓDk, in ([\ref=symm.d.]) has certain group-theoretical relations γJs(γ)  =  Γ - JS(γ) for isometries γ and s(γ) in [formula] and Ψk, respectively, and a set S(γ) of isometries in Ψk. For example, for ΓD2, one of the group-theoretical relations is

[formula]

We shall use the notation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) to denote a group-theoretical relations of ΓDk for any k  ≥  2. So the relation in ([\ref=ex1]) will be also denoted by (ξ2,ξ- 2,{ξ2,ξη,ξη- 1}). Another example for a group-theoretical relation for ΓD2 is

[formula]

All of the group-theoretical properties of the decompositions ΓDk for k  ≥  2 are given in in . Note that s(γ) and S(γ) denote different isometries and sets of isometries in ([\ref=ex1]) and ([\ref=ex3]) for the same isometry γ. A summary for the proof of goes as follows:

In the case ([\ref=I]) Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is geometrically infinite, we first prove the statement below:

Theorem [\ref=thm3.4] Let Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 be a free, geometrically infinite Kleinian group without parabolics and, ΓDk be the decomposition of Γ in ([\ref=symm.d.]) for k  ≥  2. If z0 denotes a point in [formula], then there is a family of Borel measures {νψ}ψ∈Ψk defined on S∞ for every integer k  ≥  2 such that [formula]; (ii)  Az0(S∞) = 1; and

[formula]

for each group-theoretical relation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) of ΓDk, where Az0 is the area measure based at z0.

This theorem is given as in . In the theorem, (λψ,z0)2 is the conformal expansion factor of ψ∞ measured in the round metric centered at z0.

Decompositions of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 in ([\ref=symm.d.]) will be used in part (i) of to decompose the area measure Az0 as a sum of Borel measures νψ indexed by ψ∈Ψk. Each group-theoretical relation of ΓDk translates into a measure-theoretical relation among the Borel measures {νψ}ψ∈Ψk as described in part (iii) of . In particular, each measure νψ is transformed to the complement of certain measures in the set [formula].

For instance, the theorem above implies that [formula] for ΓD2 so that the Borel measure νξ- 2 is transformed to the complement of the sum of the measures νξη, νξ2 and νξη- 1 by the group-theoretical property in ([\ref=ex1]), which can also be expressed as

[formula]

Each displacement (z0, γ  ·  z0) for γ∈Ψk has a lower bound determined by a formula, proved originally in [\cite=CSParadox] by Culler and Shalen and improved slightly in [\cite=CSMargulis], which involves the Borel measures in {νψ}ψ∈Ψk. This formula is given as follows:

([\cite=CSParadox]; [\cite=CSMargulis]) Let a and b be numbers in

[formula]

For a given decomposition ΓDk, assuming 0 < νs(γ)(S∞) < 1 for every group-theoretical relation (γ, s(γ), S(γ)), in if we let ν  =  νs(γ), a = νs(γ)(S∞) and [formula], we obtain the lower bounds

[formula]

by . The constant values inside the logarithms on the righthand side of the inequality in ([\ref=eqn2]) can be considered as the values of certain functions, referred to as displacement functions for ΓDk, defined on the set Δd - 1 of all points in [formula] whose entries add to 1. Here d = 4  ·  3k - 1 is the cardinality of Ψk.

As an example, assuming 0 < νψ(S∞) < 1 for ψ∈{ξ2,ξη,ξη- 1,ξ- 2}, by for k = 2, , ([\ref=ex1.1]) and the definition of p for k = 2, we have the displacement function

[formula]

for the decomposition ΓD2 such that (z0, ξ2  ·  z0)  ≥  0.5 log f212( for the point [formula]. More generally, [formula] will denote in the rest of this paper the point in [formula] whose entries formed by the total masses of the measures in [formula] keeping the same ordering of Ψk. Note that for each decomposition ΓDk, and produce as many displacement functions as the number of group-theoretical relations which are counted in in .

For k = 2, for instance, there are 48 group-theoretical relations, and consequently, there is a set G2 of 48 displacement functions. One of which is f212 given above (See ([\ref=deffs]), ([\ref=defgs]) and ([\ref=dispothergs]) for some others). These functions provide a lower bound for the maximum of hyperbolic displacements by the inequality

[formula]

for [formula], where [formula].

Let Gk denote the set of all displacement functions for the decomposition ΓDk of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉. Explicit formulas of the functions in Gk are given in in . In general we shall prove the following statement.

Theorem [\ref=minG] If [formula] is the function defined by   ↦   max {f(f∈Gk}, then we have inf ∈Δd - 1Gk(  ·  3k - 1 - 3 for k  ≥  2,

which provides the lower bounds in . This is in .

To prove , we first introduce a subset [formula] of displacement functions in Gk. A list of explicit formulas of the functions in [formula] are again given in in . For ∈Δd - 1 let us say

[formula]

We will prove in §[\ref=S3] that α*  =   inf ∈Δd - 1Gk(. This is because α*  ≤   inf ∈Δd - 1Gk( by Fk  ⊂  Gk. The reverse inequality follows from the fact that the functions in Fk take bigger values at the points in Δd - 1 that are significant to compute inf ∈Δd - 1Gk(.

The computation of α* follows from the following two properties of the function Fk:

[formula]

The equality in (A) is proved in in which uses the observation that each displacement function fki approaches to infinity on any sequence {n}  ⊂  Δd - 1 which limits on ∂Δd - 1.

Proving the property in (B) takes most of the technical work in this paper. Using , [\ref=convex1] and [\ref=convex3] we first show that each displacement function fki is strictly convex on a strictly convex subset Cfi of Δd - 1. These subsets are defined in ([\ref=C1]) and ([\ref=C2]). Next by , [\ref=unique2], [\ref=unique3], [\ref=unique4], [\ref=unique5], [\ref=unique6], [\ref=unique7] and [\ref=unique8] we establish in that * is in the intersection C of all of these sets Cfi which is itself strictly convex. Then using a number of facts , [\ref=convex5] and from convex analysis we deduce that Fk is strictly convex function on C which implies the uniqueness of *. This is given in .

Since * is unique, it is fixed by every bijection of Δd - 1 preserving the set Fk. This leads to the relations x*i = x*j among the coordinates of * for every distinct [formula]. A list of bijections and the details of the computations of the coordinates of * and α* are given in . This completes the proof of and consequently the proof of in the case ([\ref=I]).

Let [formula] denote the character variety [formula]. In the case ([\ref=II]) Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is geometrically finite, we define the function [formula] such that for a fixed [formula]. This function is continuous and proper. We shall show that fkz0 has no local minimum in [formula] the set of pairs of isometries [formula] such that 〈ξ,η〉 is free, geometrically finite and without parabolics. Since the set of (ξ,η) such that 〈ξ,η〉 is free, geometricly infinite and without parabolics is dense in [formula] and, every [formula] with 〈ξ,η〉 is free and without parabolic is in [formula] [\cite=CSParadox], geometrically finite case reduces to geometrically infinite case completing the proof of .

Symmetric Decompositions of Free Groups

Let Γ be a group which is free on a finite generating set [formula]. Let [formula]. Every element γ of Γ can be written uniquely as a reduced word [formula], where m  ≥  0, each ψi is an element of [formula], and ψi + 1  ≠  ψ- 1i for [formula]. If n  ≤  m is a positive integer and γ  ≠  1, we shall call [formula] the initial word of length n of γ.

Let Ψ* be a finite set of words in Γ. For each word ψ∈Ψ*, let Jψ denote the set of non-trivial elements of Γ that have the initial word ψ. Depending on the number of elements in Ξ and lengths of words in Ψ* there may be a set of words which are not contained in any of Jψ. This set will be called the residue set of Ψ* and denoted by Ψ*r. For a given pair (Ψ*,Ψ*r) of finite sets of words Ψ* and Ψ*r in Γ, if we have [formula], then ΓD* with D* = (Ψ*,Ψ*r) is a decomposition of Γ. In particular we shall be interested in the following decompositions:

A decomposition ΓD* with D* = (Ψ*,Ψ*r) is symmetric if Ψ* and Ψ*r are preserved by every bijection of [formula], ie if [formula] is a bijection, then φ(Ψ*) = Ψ* and φ(Ψ*r) = Ψ*r.

Let Γk be the set of all isometries of length at most k  ≥  2 in [formula]. Let Ψk be the set of all isometries of length k and Ψlr be the set of all non-identity isometries of length less than k. It is straightforward to see that

[formula]

for every k  ≥  2. Therefore, ΓDk,n is a decomposition of [formula] with Dk,n = (Ψk,Ψkr), where [formula]. Note that ΓDk,n is symmetric for each n,k  ≥  2. In the case n = 2, we have the lemma below for the number of group-theoretical relations:

Let Γ be a 2-generator free group and, ΓDk be a symmetric decomposition of Γ for k  ≥  2. Then there are Rk = 4  ·  rk  ·  3k - 1 many group-theoretical relations, where

[formula]

for aj  =  1 if j = 0,1, [formula] if 2  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1, [formula] if j = k. Above ⌊  ·  ⌋ denotes the floor function.

Let [formula] be a reduced initial word in Ψk. Since we know that the isometries ψ- 11, (ψ1ψ2)- 1,,[formula] are all in Ψlr and ψ- 1∈Ψk, we count the group-theoretical relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) according to the number i of cancellations in the product γs(γ) for [formula], where s(γ) = ψ for [formula].

Note that the product [formula] gives a group-theoretical relation with i-cancellation. Assume that the product γψ also gives a relation with i-cancellation. Then we have [formula] for some w∈Ψ*r. Since we have to have [formula], we derive that 1  ≤  length(w)  ≤   min {i,k - i} where k  ≥  2. We have 2 choices for the last letter of w and 3 choices for the rest of the letters of w. Therefore, there are [formula] group-theoretical relations with i-cancellation. Finally, the product [formula] provides the group-theoretical relation with k-cancellation. There is only 1 such relation. There are 4  ·  3k - 1 many choices for the isometry ψ∈Ψk. Thus, the first part of ([\ref=l22p1]) follows.

For the second part of ([\ref=l22p1]), let j denote the length of the product γψ, for 0  ≤  j  ≤  k. If j is 0 or 1, then we derive that [formula] or [formula], respectively. There is only 1 group-theoretical relation for each case. Let ak0 = 1 and ak1 = 1. Assume that j = k. Let i denote the number of cancellations in the product γψ. Since j = length(γ) + k - 2i, we get 0 < i  ≤  ⌊k / 2⌋. Then we have [formula] for some w∈Ψkr such that length(w) = i. There are 2 choices for the first letter of w and 3 choices for the rest. Consequently, there are [formula] many products γψ whose length is k.

An argument analogous to the one above can be repeated for each [formula] to count the number of products γψ so that length(γψ) = j with the exception that w = 1. In those cases, we get 1 additional product γψ, where γ is [formula] for each [formula]. Hence, we obtain the sum [formula] for 2  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1, which concludes the proof.

As an example, we will list all of the group-theoretical relations for the symmetric decomposition ΓD2. There are R2 = 48 relations by . First we list the relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) in so that γs(γ) has length 0. There are 12 such relations. Note that those are the relations with s(γ) = γ- 1.

Next we give the group-theoretical relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) in and such that γs(γ) has length 1 or 2. There are 12 and 24 such relations, respectively.

Similarly, we also list some of the group-theoretical relations for the symmetric decomposition ΓD3 as we shall need them in this section. By there are in total 252 group-theoretical relations. We list in the table below the ones that γs(γ) = 1.

Under the hypothesis of the log 3 theorem, we know that Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is a free group on the generators ξ and η [\cite=CSParadox]. For the symmetric decompositions of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 we have the following statement:

Let Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 be a free, geometrically infinite Kleinian group without parabolics and, ΓDk be a symmetric decomposition of Γ for k  ≥  2. If z0 denotes a point in [formula], then there is a family of Borel measures {νψ}ψ∈Ψk defined on S∞ such that [formula]; (ii)  Az0(S∞) = 1; and

[formula]

for each group-theoretical relation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) of ΓDk, where Az0 is the area measure based at z0.

As in the proof of [\cite=Y], we follow the same scheme given in the proof of [\cite=CSParadox]. Therefore we shall provide a proof sketch. In particular this proof involves Γ-invariant D-conformal densities, first constructed by Patterson [\cite=SJP] and extensively studied by Sullivan [\cite=Su1] [\cite=Su2]. Interested readers may refer to [\cite=SJP] [\cite=Su1] [\cite=Su2] [\cite=N] [\cite=CSParadox] for details on Γ-invariant D-conformal densities and their use in the context of this paper.

The group Γ acts freely on [formula]. The symmetric decomposition ΓDk of Γ implies that the orbit Wk  =  Γ  ·  z0, where is an infinite disjoint union for k  ≥  2. Let Vk be the finite collection of all sets of the form [formula], or [formula], or [formula], or [formula] for Ψ  ⊂  Ψk, where [formula] and [formula]. The application of [\cite=CSParadox] to Wk and Vk implies that there exists a number D∈[0,2], a Γ-invariant D-conformal density M = (μz) for [formula] and a family of Borel measures {νψ}ψ∈Ψk such that (a) [formula], (b) μz0(S∞) = 1 and

[formula]

for every group-theoretical relation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) of the decomposition ΓDk.

Since Γ is finitely generated, it is tame [\cite=Agol] [\cite=CG]. Then [\cite=CSParadox] and [\cite=CSParadox] imply that every Γ-invariant D-conformal density M is a constant multiple of the area density A or D = 2. From (b), we get M  =  A. Finally (iii) follows from (c).

The number of displacement functions for the decomposition ΓDk is determined by the number of group-theoretical relations counted in . We aim to apply and to each group-theoretical relation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) for the decomposition ΓDk to determine these displacement functions for each k  ≥  2.

Let [formula], [formula], [formula] and, [formula]. For d = 4  ·  3k - 1 let us define the set

[formula]

Points of Δd - 1 will be written in bold fonts, eg [formula]. We shall use the functions [formula] and [formula] with formulas

[formula]

for j = 1,2,3,4, respectively, to express the displacement functions compactly. In particular we prove the following;

Let Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 be a free , geometrically infinite Kleinian group without parabolics and, ΓDk be a symmetric decomposition of Γ for k  ≥  2. Let [formula] be the integers given by . Then there exists a set of functions

[formula]

such that for any [formula] and for each γ∈Ψk, the expression e2(z0, γ  ·  z0) is bounded below by f( for ∈Δd - 1 for at least one of f∈Gk, where

[formula]

Let {νψ}ψ∈Ψk be the family of Borel measures on S∞ given by for Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉. Then we claim that 0 < νψ(S∞) < 1 for every ψ∈Ψk for every k  ≥  2. To prove the claim it is enough to show that νψ0(S∞)  ≠  0 for all ψ0∈Ψk.

Assume that νψ0(S∞) = 0 for a given ψ0∈Ψk. Note that (ψ0,ψ- 10,S(ψ0)) is a group-theoretical property for ΓDk when S(ψ0) is the set of words in Ψk which doesn't start with the first letter of ψ0. Since we have ψ- 10 = s(ψ0), we get [formula] by (iii). Then we see that νψ1(S∞)  ≠  0 for some ψ1∈S(ψ0). Let ψ2∈Ψk - S(ψ0). If S(ψ2) denotes the set of all words in Ψk which doesn't start with the first letter of ψ2, then (ψ2,ψ- 12,S(ψ2)) is a group-theoretical relation for ΓDk. By the equalities [formula] and [formula] we derive that νψ2(S∞) = 0. By (iii), we obtain that [formula]. Using the facts that [formula] and [formula], we find that νψ1(S∞) = 0, a contradiction.

(iii) and (ii) show that νs(γ)(S∞) and [formula] satisfy the hypothesis of for each group-theoretical relation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) of ΓDk. Hence by letting ν  =  νs(γ), a = νs(γ)(S∞) and [formula] in we obtain the lower bounds

[formula]

for each relation (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) of ΓDk, where [formula] for the bijection [formula] in ([\ref=Enum]). We replace each constant mp(ψ) appearing in ([\ref=eqn4]) with the variable xp(ψ). Let [formula].

The constants obtained on the right hand-side of the inequalities in the expression ([\ref=eqn4]) can be considered as the values of the functions in Gk at the point k. The first group of functions {fki}i∈Ik are determined by the relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) so that length(γs(γ)) = 0. The second group {gk,1i}i∈Ik is determined by the relations with length(γs(γ)) = 1. Finally, the third group of functions

[formula]

are determined by the relations with the condition 2  ≤  length(γs(γ))  ≤  k. Hence we obtain Rk many displacement functions so that e2(z0, γ  ·  z0) is bounded below by f(k) for at least one of f∈Gk. The formulas of the functions {fki}i∈Ik are derived from the fact that they are obtained by the group-theoretical relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) for s(γ) = γ- 1.

As an illustration, we list some of the displacement functions for the symmetric decomposition ΓD2. These displacement functions are produced by using for k = 2, and the group-theoretical relations listed in given above:

Let [formula]. For instance, by we have the inequalities

[formula]

obtained by the group-theoretical relations (1), (2), (3) and (4) in . Some other displacement functions for the symmetric decomposition ΓD2 are

[formula]

obtained by the group-theoretical relations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) in , respectively. Then these functions imply the inequalities

[formula]

By the group-theoretical relations (2), (5), (13) and (16) in we also obtain the following displacement functions for the symmetric decomposition ΓD2 of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉:

The functions in ([\ref=dispothergs]) provide the lower bounds for the hyperbolic displacements listed below:

[formula]

There are in total 48 such inequalities for the displacements under the isometries [formula] determined by the symmetric decomposition ΓD2 (see ). Notice that the displacement functions f24, f23, g2,11, g2,12, g2,13, g2,14, g2,15, g2,16, g2,21,1, g2,21,2, g2,21,5 and g2,21,6, which were studied in [\cite=Y], give lower bounds for the hyperbolic displacements under the set of isometries [formula] in the symmetric decomposition ΓD2.

As another example, by the group-theoretical relations in , for k = 3 and we obtain the formulas of some of the displacement functions {f3i}i∈I3 for the symmetric decomposition ΓD3 as

[formula]

for [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] so that (z0, γ  ·  z0)  ≥  0.5 log f3i( for some i∈I3 for every γ∈Ψ3, where [formula]. There are 252 such displacement functions for the displacements under the isometries [formula] determined by the symmetric decomposition ΓD3 (see ). To calculate a lower bound for the maximum of the hyperbolic displacements under the isometries in [formula], we shall compute the greatest lower bound for the maximum of all of the functions in Gk over the simplex Δd - 1. In particular, if Gk is the continuous function defined as

[formula]

we aim to calculate inf ∈Δd - 1Gk(. The details of this computation are given in .

Infima of the Maximum of the Functions in Gk on Δd - 1

Calculations given in this section are for a fixed integer k  ≥  2. Therefore, we shall drop the superscript k, the marker of the symmetric decomposition ΓDk of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉, from the displacement functions {fki}i∈Ik whose formulas are listed in . If Fk  =  {fi}i∈Ik, we will show that inf ∈Δd - 1Gk( inf ∈Δd - 1Fk( for every k  ≥  2 (see and [\ref=minG]), where Fk is the continuous function defined as

[formula]

Therefore, it is enough to find inf ∈Δd - 1Fk(. We first prove the following lemma:

If Fk is the function defined in ([\ref=F]), then α*  =   inf ∈Δd - 1Fk( is attained in Δd - 1 and contained in the interval

[formula]

This proof uses analogous arguments given in [\cite=Y]. To save space we give a proof sketch. By the formulas of fi given in , for some fi∈Fk we see that fi(n) approaches to infinity on any sequence {n}  ⊂  Δd - 1 which limits on ∂Δd - 1. This observation implies that inf ∈Δd - 1Fk( min ∈Δd - 1Fk(.

We have fi( for every ∈Δd - 1 which shows that α*  ≥  1. Consider the point [formula], where d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Then for every k  ≥  2 we get Σ1(Σ2(Σ3(Σ4(. Again by the formulas of fi given in , we have fi(*) = 3  ·  (4  ·  3k - 1 - 1) for every i∈Ik. As a result we obtain α*∈[1,12   ·   3k  -  1  -  3].

We shall use the notation * to denote a point at which the infimum of Fk is attained on Δd - 1. To calculate α*  =   min ∈Δd - 1Fk(, we exploit the convexity properties of the displacement functions in Fk.

For j∈{1,2,3,4} and i∈Ik, introduce the functions [formula], [formula] and [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula]. Remember that we have the sets

[formula]

Given a displacement function fi(σ(Σj(σ(xi) in Fk for j∈{1,2,3,4} and i∈Ik in , it can be expressed as

[formula]

So the convexity of fi∈Fk follows from the convexities of f and g. We shall use the statement below which gives a sufficient condition to check the convexities of f and g:

Let f be a twice continuously differentiable real-valued function on an open convex set C in [formula]. Then f is a strictly convex function if its Hessian matrix Hf(∂2f / ∂xi∂xj( for [formula] is positive definite for every ∈C.

As this theorem is one of the standard facts from convex analysis, various proofs are readily available in the literature. Therefore no proof will be included here. Interested readers may refer to [\cite=RTRoc] for an analogous statement and its proof.

In particular implies that a twice continuously differentiable real-valued function f(x,y) is strictly convex on an open convex set C if fxx(, fyy( and det  Hf( for every ∈C. Then we have the following lemmas:

Let [formula]. Then Cg is an open convex set and, g(x,y) is a strictly convex function on Cg.

Consider the equality x + 2y - xy - y2 = 3 / 4. For [formula] we have [formula] for every y∈(0,3 / 4), which implies the first assertion of the lemma. Note that g is twice continuously differentiable on Cg. Consider the Hessian matrix Hg( of g:

[formula]

for  = (x,y)∈Δ. It is clear that gxx( for every ∈Cg. We also have gyy( for every ∈Cg because

[formula]

The determinant (3 + 4x( - 1 + y) - 8y + 4y2) / (y4(x + y)4) of Hg( is positive for every (x,y)∈Cg. Hence, g(x,y) is strictly convex on Cg by .

Let [formula]. Then Cf is an open convex set and f(x,y) is a strictly convex function on Cf.

It is clear to see that Cf is an open convex set and f is twice continuously differentiable on Cf. Now consider the Hessian matrix Hf() of f:

[formula]

at  = (x,y)∈Δ. Note that fxx( and fyy( for every ∈Cf. The determinant (3 + 4x( - 1 + y) - 4y) / (x4y4) of Hf( is positive for every (x,y)∈Δ if x + xy + y < 3 / 4 . The line [formula] is tangent to the curve x + xy + y = 3 / 4 at the point [formula]. Since for [formula] we have [formula] for every x∈(0,3 / 4), the function f(x,y) is strictly convex on Cf by .

The functions f(x,y) and g(x,y) are strictly convex functions on the open convex set [formula].

By the proof of we know that f has a positive definite Hessian matrix over the set [formula]. Note that Cf  ⊂  C. The curves [formula], x + xy + y = 3 / 4 and x + 2y - xy - y2 = 3 / 4 intersect in Δ only at the point P defined in the lemma above. Since we have

[formula]

for [formula] and

[formula]

for [formula], the conclusion of the lemma follows.

Let fi(σ(Σj(σ(xi) be a displacement function in Fk described in . If i∈Ij, then define the set

[formula]

if i∉Ij, by abusing the notation, define the set

[formula]

If Cfi for i∈Ik are described as above, then [formula] is nonempty, where d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Because, if we consider the point [formula], then Σj(*) = 1 / 4 and Σij(*) = 1 / 4 - 1 / (4  ·  3k - 1). For k = 2 and k  ≥  3, we clearly have

[formula]

Thus * is in Cfi for every fi(σ(Σj(σ(xi)∈Fk such that i∈Ij. Similarly for k = 2 and k  ≥  3 we have the inequalities

[formula]

which shows that * is in Cfi for every fi(σ(Σj(σ(xi)∈Fk such that i∉Ij.

We shall prove further statements about the elements of the sets Cfi. In each statement we consider the following cases

[formula]

We will carry out the calculations for k = 2, if necessary for k = 3 or 4, and indicate how to generalise these calculations for the cases in (2) and (3) for easy reading. For k  ≥  2 let us define the functions

[formula]

Assume that k is even and k  ≥  2. We note that there are m = m(k) many elements in I1 which are equivalent to 1 in modulo 4. The same is true for the number of elements equivalent to 2 or 3. But there are n = n(k) many elements in I1 which are equivalent to 0 in modulo 4. In other words we obtain the list (m,m,m,n) for the number of elements in I1 which are equivalent to 1, 2, 3 or 0, respectively. Together with I2, I3 and I4, we have the lists

[formula]

Note that the lists for k = 2 are (1,1,1,0), (1,1,0,1), (1,0,1,1) and (0,1,1,1). This table will be used in , [\ref=unique2], [\ref=unique5] and [\ref=unique6].

Assume that k > 2 is odd. In this case there are m many elements in I1 which are equivalent to 1 in modulo 4. There are n many elements each in I1 which are equivalent to 2, 3 or 0 in modulo 4. In other words we obtain the list (m,n,n,n) for the number of elements in I1 which are equivalent to 1, 2, 3 or 0, respectively. Together with I2, I3 and I4 we have the lists

[formula]

This table will be used in , [\ref=unique4], [\ref=unique7] and [\ref=unique8]. In particular we shall deploy the tables in ([\ref=keven]) and ([\ref=kodd]) to add the terms in the summations in the lemmas below indexed over some or all of the elements of I1, I2, I3 and I4. Since we only use modulo 4, we shall indicate [formula] with [formula] in the rest of this text . Let us define the function for k  ≥  2. Then we have the followings:

Let Fk  =  {fi} for i∈Ik be the set of displacement functions listed in and Fk be as in ([\ref=F]). Let * be a point in Δd - 1 so that α* = Fk(*) for d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Let fi∈Fk be of the form fi = f(Σj,xi) for j∈{1,2,3,4} and [formula] where Σj( and f are defined in ([\ref=sigma]) and ([\ref=fg]), respectively. If k  ≥  2 is even, j = 1 and i∈I2 such that [formula], then *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C2]).

Assume on the contrary that *∉Cfi. By the definition of Cfi we obtain that

[formula]

Let Σ*1  =  Σ1(*), Σ*2  =  Σ2(*), Σ*3  =  Σ3(*) and Σ*4  =  Σ4(*) defined in ([\ref=sigma]), where Σ*1  +  Σ*2  +  Σ*3  +  Σ*4 = 1 since *∈Δd - 1. Also let [formula]. We consider the cases below:

[formula]

We shall assume without the loss of generality that k = 2. Assume that (A) holds. Then since Σ*2 > x*i, we have Σ*1  +  Σ*2  >  2N. This gives the inequality

[formula]

which implies the following cases:

[formula]

Assume that (i) holds. Since Σ*3  <  M / 2 and Σ4  <  M / 2, by the inequalities [formula] for r = 3,4 we find that

[formula]

for every l∈Ik so that [formula]. Using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∉I1 we calculate that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn1]) hold for every even k > 2. Hence case (i) does't hold.

Assume that (ii) holds in ([\ref=1-3]). By ([\ref=xis]) we already know that [formula] for every l∈Ik such that [formula]. For l∈I2 by the table in ([\ref=keven]) we derive that

[formula]

which shows that [formula]. This implies that [formula] for some r∈I3 such that [formula]. We shall examine the cases r∈I3 so that [formula], or 3, or 0 in this order.

Assume that [formula]. Using [formula] we calculate that which leads to the contradiction

[formula]

So we conclude that x*r  ≥  Q(k)|k = 2 for every r∈I3 such that [formula].

Assume that [formula]. Since [formula] we obtain that [formula]. Then for l∈I3 using the table in ([\ref=keven]) we see that

[formula]

a contradiction. So we must have [formula] for every r∈I3 such that [formula].

Assume that [formula]. Using [formula] we get [formula]. From the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] and t∈I3 we calculate

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn3]), ([\ref=eqnn4]) and ([\ref=eqnn8]) hold for every even k > 2. Therefore case (ii) doesn't hold.

In case (iii) in ([\ref=1-3]) we see that the inequalities for Σ*3 and Σ*4 are switched. So the discussion that shows that case (ii) doesn't hold works for case (iii) as well by switching the roles of Σ*3 and I3 with Σ*4 and I4, respectively. We obtain the same expressions on the right-hand side of the inequalities in ([\ref=eqn32]), ([\ref=eqnn3]), ([\ref=eqnn4]) and ([\ref=eqnn8]). In particular we repeat the computations given in the order [formula] for l∈I3 above in the order [formula] for l∈I4. So case (iii) doesn't hold. As a result we conclude that (A) in ([\ref=ABC]) is not the case.

We consider the next case Σ*1  ≥  N > x*i (B) in ([\ref=ABC]). Then we derive the inequality

[formula]

which implies the following cases:

[formula]

We examine the cases (i)-(vii). Assume that (i) holds. Since we have Σ*r  ≤  M / 3 for r = 2,3,4, using the inequality [formula] we find that

[formula]

for every l∈Ik so that [formula]. Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 3 in this case, for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} by the table in ([\ref=keven]) we obtain that

[formula]

By the inequality in ([\ref=ineq]) we derive that

[formula]

Then using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] we obtain a contradiction which is

[formula]

The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn11]) holds for every even k > 2. Hence we conclude that case (i) doesn't hold.

Assume that (ii) in ([\ref=1-7]) holds. Since we have Σ*2  ≤  M / 3 and Σ*3  ≤  M / 3, we find [formula] for every l∈Ik such that [formula] by ([\ref=xis2]). By the inequality Σ*2  ≤  M / 3, for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} we obtain from the table in ([\ref=keven]) that

[formula]

By using the inequality in ([\ref=ineq]) we obtain

[formula]

We claim that Σ*4  <  4 / 13. Because otherwise for [formula] using the table in ([\ref=keven]) we derive that

[formula]

a contradiction. Using the inequalities [formula], we find that [formula] for l∈Ik such that [formula]. Then using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] we get

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn14]) and ([\ref=eqnn15]) hold for every even k > 2. Therefore, case (ii) doesn't hold.

We can repeat the argument given above for case (ii) for case (iii) in ([\ref=1-7]) as well by switching the roles of Σ*3 and Σ*4. Note that the number of elements in [formula] which are equivalent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 is the same as the number of elements in [formula] which are equivalent to 1 or 3 modulo 4 by table in ([\ref=keven]). We get the same inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn12]), ([\ref=eqnn14]) and ([\ref=eqnn15]). Hence case (iii) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (iv) holds in ([\ref=1-7]). Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 3, we have [formula] for every [formula] by ([\ref=xis2]). We shall examine the following cases:

[formula]

Assume that (a) holds. Then by the inequality in ([\ref=ineq]) we derive the expression below

[formula]

By the table in ([\ref=keven]), for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} we obtain a contradiction which is given as

[formula]

The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn18]) holds for every even k > 2. So (a) is not the case.

Assume that (b) holds. Since we have x*i  <  M / 3, by the inequality in ([\ref=ineq]) we obtain

[formula]

We claim that Σ*3 < 10 / 33. Because otherwise we calculate for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} that

[formula]

a contradiction. A similar contradiction arises if we assume Σ*4 < 10 / 33 in the inequality above instead of Σ*3. By [formula] for r  =  3,4 we find that [formula] for [formula]. Then we compute by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn20]) and ([\ref=eqnn21]) hold for every even k > 2. Hence (b) is not the case either. Hence case (iv) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (v) holds in ([\ref=1-7]). Since Σ*3  ≤  M / 3 and Σ*4  ≤  M / 3, by using ([\ref=xis2]) above we obtain [formula] for [formula]. We shall examine the cases (a) and (b) in ([\ref=abc]) and, additionally in (c), where

[formula]

If [formula] (a), by ([\ref=ineq]) we obtain [formula], where L(k) is defined in ([\ref=eqnn17]). We claim that Σ*2  <  13 / 50. Because otherwise using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] we get

[formula]

a contradiction. By the inequalities [formula] for [formula], we find [formula]. For [formula] this gives a contradiction that is

[formula]

This rules out the assumption [formula] in (a). The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn22]) and ([\ref=eqnn23]) hold for every even k > 2.

Assume that [formula] in (b). Since x*i  <  M / 3, again by ([\ref=ineq]) we calculate that [formula]. We claim that Σ*2  <  2 / 5. Otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] we would obtain a contradiction

[formula]

Then the inequalities [formula] for [formula] imply that [formula] for [formula]. We repeat the argument above to improve on these lower bounds as follows: We claim that Σ*2  <  16 / 51. Otherwise from the table in ([\ref=keven]), for [formula] we see that

[formula]

a contradiction. By [formula], we find that [formula] for [formula]. We claim that Σ*1  <  15 / 32. Because otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] we would obtain

[formula]

a contradiction. By the inequalities [formula] for [formula] we find that [formula]. As a result for [formula] we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction, which rules out the assumption [formula]. Again all of the inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn24]), ([\ref=eqnn25]), ([\ref=eqnn255]) and ([\ref=eqnn28]) hold for every even k > 2.

Assume that M / 3 < x*i < N (c). Using the table in ([\ref=keven]), for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} we derive that

[formula]

Since *∈Δ11 and Σ*1  ≥  N by (B), we have Let [formula]. We shall examine the cases below:

[formula]

Assume that (d) holds. Using [formula] for r = 3,4, for [formula] such that [formula], we obtain As an implication of the inequality above by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula], we get

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn29]) hold for every even k > 2. This rules out the assumption in (d).

Assume that (e) holds in ([\ref=def]). Since [formula], we obtain [formula] for [formula]. We claim that Σ*1 < 12 / 33. Otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]), for l∈I3, we find

[formula]

a contradiction. Using [formula] for [formula], we calculate that [formula]. Then for l∈I3 we obtain a contradiction

[formula]

The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn31]) and ([\ref=eqnn32]) hold for every even k > 2. This shows that (e) doesn't hold.

Assume that (f) holds in ([\ref=def]). In this case we can use the argument above that proves that (e) doesn't hold. By interchanging the roles of Σ*3 and I3 with Σ*4 and I4, respectively, we repeat the computations. We obtain the same inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn31]) and ([\ref=eqnn32]) which imply that (f) doesn't hold. As a result we rule out the case (c). In particular we conclude that case (v) in ([\ref=1-7]) does not hold.

Assume that case (vi) holds in ([\ref=1-7]). Since Σ*3  ≤  M / 3 in this case, we know by ([\ref=xis2]) that [formula] for [formula]. We examine the cases (a), (b), and (c) in ([\ref=abc]) and ([\ref=c]). If [formula] (a), we obtain by ([\ref=ineq]) that

[formula]

where L(k) is explicitly given in ([\ref=eqnn17]). Then we derive the following contradiction

[formula]

So (a) is not the case. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn34]) holds for every even k > 2.

If [formula] (b), we get [formula] by ([\ref=ineq]). We claim that Σ*2  <  9 / 25. Because otherwise we find

[formula]

a contradiction. By the inequality [formula] for [formula], we find that [formula]. Next we claim that Σ*4  <  31 / 100. Otherwise for l∈I3  =  {7,8,9} we would obtain using the table in ([\ref=keven]) that

[formula]

a contradiction. By the inequality [formula] for [formula], we see that [formula]. Also we claim that Σ*1  <  11 / 25. Otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]), for l∈I3 we compute that

[formula]

a contradiction. By the inequality [formula] this implies that [formula] for [formula]. Finally using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3  =  {7,8,9} we obtain a contradiction because

[formula]

This shows that (b) doesn't hold. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn35]), ([\ref=eqnn36]), ([\ref=eqnn37]) and ([\ref=eqnn38]) hold for every even k > 2.

Assume that x*i  ≥  M / 3 (c). Then by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I2  =  {4,5,6} we calculate that

[formula]

We claim that Σ*1  <  23 / 50. Because otherwise for l∈I3 we would compute that

[formula]

a contradiction. Then we find that [formula] by the inequality σ(x*l)σ(23 / 50) < σ(Σ*1)σ(x*l)  ≤  33 for [formula]. Similarly we claim that Σ*2  <  21 / 50. Otherwise by the table ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3  =  {7,8,9} we obtain

[formula]

another contradiction. By the inequality σ(x*l)σ(21 / 50) < σ(Σ*2)σ(x*l)  ≤  33 we derive that [formula] for [formula]. Then we claim that Σ*4 < 14 / 49. Otherwise for [formula] so that l   ≠   i by the table in ([\ref=keven]) we would find a contradiction

[formula]

Now using the inequalities [formula] for [formula] we see that [formula]. As a result using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] so that l  ≠  i we obtain a contradiction

[formula]

This eliminates the case x*i  ≥  M / 3 (c). The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn39]), ([\ref=eqnn40]), ([\ref=eqnn41]) and ([\ref=eqnn42]) hold for every even k > 2. Hence we conclude that case (vi) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (vii) holds in ([\ref=1-7]). Note that the inequalities for Σ*3 and Σ*4 are switched in this case. Therefore the argument given above which shows that case (vi) doesn't hold can be repeated by replacing the roles of Σ*3 and I3 with Σ*4 and I4. We obtain the same inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn36]), ([\ref=eqnn37]), ([\ref=eqnn38]), ([\ref=eqn79]), ([\ref=eqnn39]), ([\ref=eqnn40]), ([\ref=eqnn41]) and ([\ref=eqnn42]) which imply that case (vii) does't hold. As a result we derive that Σ*1  ≥  N > x*i (B) in ([\ref=ABC]) is not the case either.

Assume that x*i  ≥  N > Σ*1 (C) in ([\ref=ABC]). Note that Σ*2  >  x*i  ≥  N > M / 3. We need to consider the following cases

[formula]

If (i) holds, we see that [formula] by ([\ref=ineq]). Since Σ*1  ≤  M / 3, Σ*3  ≤  M / 3 and Σ*4  ≤  M / 3 , we get [formula] for [formula] by ([\ref=xis2]). Then by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] we find a contradiction which is

[formula]

The inequality in ([\ref=eqnn43]) holds for every even k > 2. Therefore case (i) doesn't hold.

If (ii) holds, we again have x*i  ≥  L. We also have [formula] for [formula] by ([\ref=xis2]). Then by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] so that [formula] and l   ≠   i we find that

[formula]

For [formula] this implies that [formula]. Then for some [formula] so that [formula] we get

[formula]

If [formula] in ([\ref=eqnn45]), by the inequality [formula] we derive Then by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] such that l   ≠   i we obtain a contradiction

[formula]

So [formula] for [formula].

If [formula] in ([\ref=eqnn45]), then we calculate that [formula] by using the inequality [formula]. As a result using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula] and [formula] we find a contradiction that is

[formula]

The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn47]) and ([\ref=eqn89]) hold for every k > 2. Hence we conclude that (ii) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (iii) holds in ([\ref=1-7-2]). We use the same argument given above that shows that case (ii) doesn't hold by switching the roles of Σ*4 and Σ*3. We get the same inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn44]), ([\ref=eqnn47]), ([\ref=eqn89]) and, ([\ref=eqnn45]). Hence case (iii) also doesn't hold for every even k  ≥  2.

Assume that case (iv) holds in ([\ref=1-7-2]). Since [formula] by ([\ref=ineq]), Σ*3  ≥  M / 3 and Σ*4  ≥  M / 3, we obtain

[formula]

Then we find that Σ*1  +  Σi2(*)  ≤  1 - K, where Σi2 is defined in ([\ref=fg]). For some [formula] we must have [formula]. If [formula], we see that by the inequality [formula]. So we obtain a contradiction because,

[formula]

If [formula], we get [formula] by [formula]. This gives the inequality in ([\ref=eqnn50]) again, a contradiction. Thus we have [formula] for [formula].

If [formula], then by the inequality [formula] we derive that [formula]. So by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for r∈I1   =   {1,2,3} we find

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn50]) and ([\ref=eqnn51]) hold for every even k > 2. Hence case (iv) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (v) holds in ([\ref=1-7-2]). Since Σ*3  ≤  M / 3 and Σ*4  ≤  M / 3, by ([\ref=xis2]) we have [formula] for [formula]. Using the table in ([\ref=keven]), for l∈I2   =   {4,5,6} we derive from (C) that

[formula]

Since *∈Δ11 and Σ*1  ≥  M / 3 , we have Let [formula]. We shall examine the cases below in the rest of the argument:

[formula]

Assume that (d) holds. Using [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula], we obtain for [formula]. We claim that Σ*1 < 4 / 25. Because otherwise, by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for [formula], we get a contradiction

[formula]

By the inequalities [formula] for [formula], we calculate that [formula]. For [formula] this implies

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn52]) and ([\ref=eqnn53]) hold for every even k > 2. This rules out the assumption in (d).

Assume that (e) holds in ([\ref=def2]). Since [formula], we obtain [formula] for [formula]. We claim that Σ*1  <  3 / 11. Otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]), for l∈I3, we find

[formula]

a contradiction. Using [formula] for [formula], we calculate that [formula]. Then by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3 we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn54]) and ([\ref=eqnn56]) hold for every even k > 2. This shows that (e) doesn't hold.

Assume that (f) holds in ([\ref=def2]). We can use the argument above that proves that (e) doesn't hold to show that (f) also doesn't hold by interchanging the roles of Σ*3 and I3 with Σ*4 and I4, respectively. We get the same inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn54]) and ([\ref=eqnn56]). As a result we conclude that case (v) in ([\ref=1-7-2]) does not hold.

Assume that case (vi) holds in ([\ref=1-7-2]). Since Σ*3  ≤  M / 3, we have [formula] for every [formula] by ([\ref=xis2]). Using the inequalities in ([\ref=Sg2]) and ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I2 and the assumption of (C) we find that

[formula]

Since Σ*1  ≥  M / 3 and Σ*4  ≥  M / 3 we see that

[formula]

We must have [formula] for some r∈I3. Since we have [formula] for every even k  ≥  2, we deduce that [formula].

Assume that [formula]. By [formula], we obtain

[formula]

We claim that Σ*1  <  9 / 25. Otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3   =   {7,8,9} we would find a contradiction which is

[formula]

Then we find that [formula] for all [formula] by using the inequality [formula]. Then for l∈I3 we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction, which shows that [formula] for all [formula].

Assume that [formula]. By [formula] we get [formula], defined in ([\ref=eqnn60]). Then we derive the same inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn58]) since Σ*1  ≥  M / 3 and [formula] switched roles. So we must have [formula] for all [formula].

Assume that [formula]. By [formula] we get [formula], defined in ([\ref=eqnn60]). But S(k) > T(k) for every even k  ≥  2. So we shall use S(k) for the calculations. We claim that Σ*2 < 23 / 50. Otherwise using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3 we derive a contradiction that is

[formula]

Then we compute that [formula] for all [formula] by using the inequality [formula]. We claim that Σ*4 < 11 / 48. Otherwise by the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3 we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction. So we find that [formula] for all [formula] by the inequality [formula]. Then using the table in ([\ref=keven]) for l∈I3 we compute that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=eqnn57]), ([\ref=eqnn58]), ([\ref=eqnn61]), ([\ref=eqnn62]) and ([\ref=eqnn63]) hold for every even k > 2. Hence case (vi) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (vii) in ([\ref=1-7-2]) holds. We use the argument given above to prove that case (vi) doesn't hold to show that case (vii) also doesn't hold by switching the roles of Σ*3 and I3 with Σ*4 and I4, respectively. We find the inequalities in ([\ref=eqn101]), ([\ref=eqnn57]), ([\ref=eqnn58]), ([\ref=eqnn61]), ([\ref=eqnn62]) and ([\ref=eqnn63]). As a result we find that x*i  ≥  N > Σ*1 (C) in ([\ref=ABC]) is not the case. Finally the conclusion of the lemma follows.

The proof of is symmetric in the sense that it can be repeated for any other displacement function fi in Fk for the choices of indices j∈{1,2,3,4} and [formula] satisfying the hypothesis of the lemma for any k  ≥  2. Rearrangement of the relevant index sets is required. In fact we have the following statements:

Under the hypothesis of , if k  ≥  2 is even, then we have *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C2]), for each of the following cases:

[formula]

We reorganise the inequalities in ([\ref=ABC]), ([\ref=sum1]), ([\ref=1-3]), ([\ref=sum2]), ([\ref=1-7]) and ([\ref=1-7-2]) according to each j and i listed in the lemma. Then we follow the computations carried out in the proof of for the chosen j and i. By using the table in ([\ref=keven]) we perform analogous computations given in the proof of and get the same inequalities in the proof. This implies the conclusion of the lemma.

Under the hypothesis of , if k > 2 is odd, j = 1 and i∈I2 so that [formula], then *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C2]).

Since j = 1, [formula] and i∈I2, we use the same steps given in the proof of with the same organisations listed in ([\ref=ABC]), ([\ref=sum1]), ([\ref=1-3]), ([\ref=sum2]), ([\ref=1-7]) and ([\ref=1-7-2]).

Because k > 2 is odd, there are changes to be made in the counts of certain summations. These changes are listed in detail in below. Without changing the orders of the sums appearing in each of the inequalities and computations, from left to right we replace the terms given under the column 'k  ≥  2, even' with the terms given under the column 'k > 2, odd' for the indicated equations in the proof of . Let m = m(k) and n = n(k) defined in ([\ref=mn]).

After the changes are made, all of the inequalities listed in the table are still satisfied giving the necessary lower bounds for contradictions. The entries in the table without hyperlinks are for the equations in the line one above with a hyperlink for which the computations are not explicitly carried out in the proof of , eg case (iii) in ([\ref=1-3]). Hence the conclusion of the lemma holds.

Under the hypothesis of , if k > 2 is odd, then we have *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C2]), for each of the cases in ([\ref=cases]).

Given a pair of j and i listed in the lemma, we reorganise the inequalities in ([\ref=ABC]), ([\ref=sum1]), ([\ref=1-3]), ([\ref=sum2]), ([\ref=1-7]) and ([\ref=1-7-2]) accordingly. By using the terms listed under the columns 'k > 2, odd' in for the indicated equations, we repeat the arguments presented in the proof of for the chosen j and i.

We shall continue proving statements about the elements of the sets Cfi for fi∈Fk. Note that there is no displacement function fi∈F2 in the form fi = g(Σij,xi) if k = 2. Therefore in the following statements we shall give the explicit computations for k = 3. We have the lemmas below:

Let Fk  =  {fi} for i∈Ik be the set of displacement functions listed in and Fk be as in ([\ref=F]). Let * be a point in Δd - 1 so that α* = Fk(*) for d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Let fi∈Fk be of the form fi = g(Σij,xi) for j∈{1,2,3,4} and [formula], where Σij( and g are defined in ([\ref=fg]), respectively. If k > 2 is odd, j = 1 and i∈I1 such that [formula], then *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C1]).

Assume on the contrary that *∉Cfi. Then by the definition of Cfi we have

[formula]

Let Σ*1  =  Σ1(*), Σ*2  =  Σ2(*), Σ*3  =  Σ3(*) and Σ*4  =  Σ4(*) defined in ([\ref=sigma]), where Σ*1  +  Σ*2  +  Σ*3  +  Σ*4 = 1 since *∈Δd - 1. We have Σi1(*) + x*i  =  Σ*1. Also let [formula]. Remember that σ(x) = 1 / x - 1. We consider the cases:

[formula]

Assume without loss of generality that k = 3. Assume that (A) holds. We derive that Σ*1  ≥  2N. Then we have the inequality

[formula]

which implies the following cases:

[formula]

Assume that (i) holds. By using [formula] for r = 2,3,4 we find that

[formula]

for every [formula] so that [formula]. Then using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for [formula] we see that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn1]) holds for every odd k > 3. Therefore case (i) doesn't hold.

Assume that (ii) holds in ([\ref=1-7-3]). By [formula] for r = 2,3 we obtain [formula] for every [formula] so that [formula] by ([\ref=xis3]). Then using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for [formula] we see that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn2]) holds for every odd k > 3. Therefore case (ii) doesn't hold.

Assume that (iii) holds in ([\ref=1-7-3]). We can repeat the argument given above for this case as well. We need to switch the role of [formula] with [formula] because, Σ*2  ≤  M / 3 and Σ*4  ≤  M / 3. By using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for [formula] we get

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequality above holds for every odd k > 3. So case (iii) doesn't hold.

Assume that (iv) holds in ([\ref=1-7-3]). We use the same argument used in case (iii) by switching the role of [formula] with [formula]. Then we get the same inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn3]) which hold for every odd k  ≥  3. This is because by the table in ([\ref=kodd]) the number 4n(k) of elements in [formula] equivalent to 1 or 3 is the same as the number of elements in [formula] equivalent to 2 or 1. So case (iv) doesn't hold.

Assume that (v) holds in ([\ref=1-7-3]). Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 3 in this case, we calculate that [formula] for every [formula] so that [formula] by ([\ref=xis3]). Then for l∈I2 we find a contradiction which is

[formula]

Since the inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn5]) holds for every odd k > 3, case (v) doesn't hold.

The argument given above for case (v) also shows that cases (vi) and (vii) don't hold. Because we can repeat the computations for case (iv) by switching the role of I2 with I3 for case (vi). For case (vii), we switch the role of I2 with I4. By the table in ([\ref=kodd]) we obtain the same inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn5]). As a result we conclude that Σi1(*)  ≥  N and x*i  ≥  N (A) in ([\ref=ABC2]) is not the case.

Assume that (B) holds in ([\ref=ABC2]). We know that Σi1(*)  ≥  N. Then we have the inequality

[formula]

Note that if two of the terms Σ*2, Σ*3 or Σ*4 are less than or equal to M / 4 simultaneously, then the third one cannot be less than or equal to M / 4. Because by using the inequality [formula] for r = 2,3,4 we find that

[formula]

for every [formula] so that [formula]. Then using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for l∈I4, l∈I3 and l∈I2, respectively, in the each of following inequalities we see that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn6_1]), ([\ref=2eqnn6_2]) and ([\ref=2eqnn6_3]) hold for every odd k > 3. This implies the following first 6 of 13 cases:

[formula]

Assume that (i) holds in ([\ref=1-7-4]). Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 4 and Σ*3  ≤  M / 4, we obtain that [formula] for all l∈Ik such that [formula] by ([\ref=xis4]). Then we compute for [formula] that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn7]) holds for every odd k > 3. So case (i) doesn't hold.

Assume that (ii) holds in ([\ref=1-7-4]). Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 4 and Σ*4  ≤  M / 4, we know that [formula] for all l∈Ik such that [formula] by ([\ref=xis4]). Then using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for [formula] we calculate that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn8]) holds for every odd k > 3. Therefore, case (ii) doesn't hold.

For case (iii) in ([\ref=1-7-4]) we get the same inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn8]) by replacing the index set [formula] with the index set [formula]. Since the inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn8]) hold for every odd k > 3, case (iii) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (iv) holds. By the inequality Σ*2  ≤  M / 4 in this case, we obtain [formula] for every [formula] by ([\ref=xis4]). We claim that Σ*3 < 13 / 50. Because otherwise by the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for l∈I2 we would get

[formula]

a contradiction. A similar contradiction arises if we assume that Σ*4  ≥  13 / 50 by the same inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn9]). Then by [formula] for r = 3,4 we obtain [formula] for every [formula] so that [formula]. By the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for l∈I2 we calculate that

[formula]

a contradiction, where Σi1(*) + x*i  =  Σ*1. The inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn10]) holds for every odd k > 3. Hence case (iv) doesn't hold.

For the case (v) we can use the argument given above for case (iv) by switching the role of I2 with I3. We obtain the same inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn9]) and ([\ref=2eqnn10]). Therefore case (v) also doesn't hold.

For case (vi) we again follow the same computations given above for case (iv) by switching the role of I2 with [formula]. By using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) we find the same inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn9]). But we need to change n and n + m in ([\ref=2eqnn10]) with n and 2n, respectively. Resulting sum will still be greater than 1 for every odd k  ≥  3. As a result case (vi) doesn't hold either. So we ruled out the first 6 cases in ([\ref=1-7-4]) out of 13 possible cases.

Under the assumption of (B) in ([\ref=ABC2]) we have the following 7 additional cases:

[formula]

Before we proceed to examine the cases in this group, we derive the following inequality from ([\ref=U5E1]). Since x*i  ≤  M / 4 and Σi1(*) - (x*i)2  <  Σi1(*), we obtain

[formula]

Assume that case (vii) holds. Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 4 and Σ*3  ≤  M / 4, we know that [formula] for every [formula] by ([\ref=xis4]). We claim that Σ*4  <  4 / 25. Assume otherwise. Then by the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for [formula] we see that

[formula]

a contradiction. By [formula] we obtain that [formula] for every [formula] so that [formula]. Then for [formula] we calculate that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn11]) and ([\ref=2eqnn12]) hold for every odd k > 3. Hence case (vii) doesn't hold.

For cases (viii) and (ix) we can repeat the computations given above for case (vii) by switching the roles of I2 and I3 with I2 and I4 respectively for case (viii) and, with I3 and [formula] respectively for case (ix). For both of the cases we obtain the same inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn11]) showing that Σ*3 < 4 / 25 and Σ*4 < 4 / 25. In the inequality in ([\ref=2eqnn12]) we need to replace 2m + 4n and 3n with m + 5n and m + 2n respectively using the table in ([\ref=kodd]). Resulting inequalities hold for every odd k  ≥  3. So both of these cases also don't hold.

Assume that case (x) holds in ([\ref=1-7-5]). Since Σ*2  ≤  M / 4, we get [formula] for all [formula] by ([\ref=xis4]). We claim that Σ*3  <  1 / 4. Assume the contrary. Then for l∈I2 by the table in ([\ref=kodd]) we compute that

[formula]

a contradiction. Using a similar argument above we can also show that Σ*4 < 1 / 4. So by [formula] for r = 3,4, we derive that [formula] for every [formula]. Then for [formula] by the table in ([\ref=kodd]) we calculate that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities ([\ref=2eqnn13]) and ([\ref=2eqnn16]) hold for every odd k > 3. Hence case (x) doesn't hold.

Assume that case (xi) holds in ([\ref=1-7-5]). By switching the role of I2 in case (x) with [formula] we repeat the same argument given for case (x) to show that case (xi) doesn't hold as well. Using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) we obtain the same inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn13]) and ([\ref=2eqnn16]) which show that this case also doesn't hold.

For case (xii) in ([\ref=1-7-5]) we again repeat an analog of the argument given above for case (x). We need to replace n and n + m in ([\ref=2eqnn16]) with n and 2n, respectively. Then the resulting inequality holds for every odd k  ≥  3. Hence case (xii) doesn't hold.

It is clear that case (xiii) in ([\ref=1-7-5]) doesn't hold. Because we derive the following inequality otherwise a contradiction. As a conclusion Σi1(*)  ≥  N > x*i (B) in ([\ref=ABC2]) is not the case.

Assume that (C) holds in ([\ref=ABC2]). Since we have x*i  ≥  N > Σi1(*), we derive that

[formula]

Assume that Σi1(*)  ≥  M / 4. The arguments we presented above to show that cases (i)-(vi) in ([\ref=1-7-4]) don't hold can be repeated by switching the roles of x*i and Σi1(*). Therefore cases with the assumptions listed in (i)-(vi) for Σ*2, Σ*3 and Σ*4 don't hold.

If Σi1(*)  ≤  M / 4, then any two of the terms Σ*2, Σ*3 and Σ*4 cannot be less than or equal to M / 4 simultaneously by the inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn6_1]), ([\ref=2eqnn6_2]) and ([\ref=2eqnn6_3]). Therefore it is enough to consider the following cases:

[formula]

Before we proceed to studying these cases, we derive the following lower bond using the inequality in ([\ref=U5E1]). Since Σi1(*)  ≤  M / 4 and (2 - Σi1(*))x*i < 2x*i, we find that

[formula]

Assume that case (i) holds. We already know by ([\ref=xis4]) that [formula] for every [formula] because Σ*2  ≤  M / 4. We claim that Σ*3 < 31 / 100. Because otherwise using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for [formula] we would have

[formula]

a contradiction. By replacing the roles of Σ*3 and Σ*4 in the inequality above we also see that Σ*4 < 31 / 100. By [formula] for r  =  3,4, we get [formula] for every [formula]. For [formula] this implies that

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn17]) and ([\ref=2eqnn20]) hold for every odd k > 3. Hence case (i) doesn't hold.

The argument above used to show that case (i) doesn't hold can be repeated to examine cases (ii) and (iii) also. We need to replace the index set [formula] with [formula] for case (ii) and replace it with [formula] for case (iii). For case (ii) the inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn17]) and ([\ref=2eqnn20]) stay the same. For case (iii) we need to interchange 2n with m + n in ([\ref=2eqnn17]) and, 2m + 2n and 2n with 4n and m + n, respectively, in ([\ref=2eqnn20]). After these changes the resulting inequalities still hold for every odd k > 3. Therefore, these cases don't hold.

Assume that (iv) holds in ([\ref=1-7-7]). We claim that Σ*2 < 31 / 100. Assume otherwise. Then we compute that

[formula]

a contradiction. By replacing the role of Σ*2 with Σ*3 and then with Σ*4 in the inequality above we also see that Σ*3 < 31 / 100 and Σ*4 < 31 / 100. By using the inequalities [formula] for r  =  2,3,4, we calculate that [formula] for every [formula]. By the table in ([\ref=kodd]) for l∈I1 we find

[formula]

a contradiction. The inequalities in ([\ref=2eqnn18]) and ([\ref=2eqnn21]) hold for every odd k > 3. Hence case (iv) doesn't hold. This shows that x*i  ≥  N > Σi1(*) (C) in ([\ref=ABC2]) is not the case either. Finally the conclusion of the lemma follows.

Similar to the proof of is symmetric in the sense that it can be reiterated to prove analogous results for the displacement functions fi in Fk for the choices of [formula] and j∈{1,2,3,4} satisfying the hypothesis of . In particular we prove the following:

Under the hypothesis of , if k > 3 is odd, then we have *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C1]), for each of the cases

[formula]

We reorganise the inequalities in ([\ref=ABC2]), ([\ref=sum3]), ([\ref=1-7-3]), ([\ref=sum5]), ([\ref=1-7-4]), ([\ref=sum4]) and ([\ref=1-7-7]) according to each j and i listed in the lemma. Then we follow the computations carried out in the proof of for the chosen j and i. Using the table in ([\ref=kodd]) we carry out the analogs of the computations given in the proof of which implies the conclusion.

Under the hypothesis of , if k > 2 is even, j = 1 and i∈I1 so that [formula], then we have *∈Cfi defined in ([\ref=C1]).

Because we have j = 1, [formula] and i∈I1, we give the same arguments given in the proof of with the same organisations listed in ([\ref=ABC2]), ([\ref=sum3]), ([\ref=1-7-3]), ([\ref=sum5]), ([\ref=1-7-4]), ([\ref=sum4]) and ([\ref=1-7-7]). Because k > 2 is even, there are changes to be made in the terms of some of the summations. These changes are listed in the table below:

In each of the inequalities and computations, from left to right, we replace the terms given under the column 'k > 2, odd' with the terms given under the column 'k > 2, even' for indicated equations, where m = m(k) and n = n(k) are defined in ([\ref=mn]). All of the resulting inequalities are still satisfied which proves the lemma.

Under the hypothesis of , if k > 2 is even, then we have *∈Cfi, defined in ([\ref=C2]), for each of the cases in ([\ref=cases1]).

Given a pair of j and i listed in the lemma, we reorganise the inequalities in ([\ref=ABC2]), ([\ref=sum3]), ([\ref=1-7-3]), ([\ref=sum3]), ([\ref=1-7-4]), ([\ref=sum4]) and ([\ref=1-7-7]) accordingly. By using the terms listed under the columns 'k > 2, even' in for the indicated equations, we repeat the arguments presented in the proof of for the chosen j and i. We get the conclusion of the lemma.

Let Fk  =  {fi} for [formula] be the set of displacement functions listed in and Fk be as in ([\ref=F]) for k  ≥  2 and d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Let * be a point in Δd - 1 so that α* = Fk(*). Then [formula].

The statement follows from , [\ref=unique2], [\ref=unique3], [\ref=unique4], [\ref=unique5], [\ref=unique6], [\ref=unique7] and [\ref=unique8].

At this point we review three more facts from convex analysis that we shall need. Proofs of these statements are relatively elementary. Therefore they are omitted. Interested readers may again refer to [\cite=RTRoc] and [\cite=KL]:

If {Ci} for i∈I is a collection of finitely many nonempty convex sets in [formula] with [formula], then C is also convex.

If {fi} for i∈I is a finite set of strictly convex functions defined on a convex set [formula], then [formula] is also strictly convex on C.

Let F be a convex function on an open convex set [formula]. If * is a local minimum of F, then it is a global minimum of F, and the set [formula] is convex. If F is strictly convex and * is a global minimum then the set [formula] consists of * alone.

An implication of the statements above for the set of displacement functions Fk is the uniqueness of the point, whose existence is guaranteed by , at which Fk takes its minimum value. In other words we prove the following statement:

Let {fi} for i∈Ik be the set of displacement functions listed in and Fk be as in ([\ref=F]). If * and * are two points in Δd - 1 so that α* = Fk(*) = Fk(*), then *  =  *.

Let Cfi for i∈Ik be the subsets of Δd - 1 as described in ([\ref=C1]) and ([\ref=C2]). By and [\ref=convex1] they are open convex subsets of Δd - 1. Then [formula] is also open and convex by . Since the displacement functions in Fk  =  {fi} for i∈Ik are either of the form f(Σj(i) or of the form g(Σij(i), each fi is a strictly convex function on the open convex set Cfi by and [\ref=convex1]. Then implies that every fi for i∈Ik is convex on [formula].

Let F = Fk and [formula]. The conclusion of the lemma follows from , and .

The uniqueness of * given by reduces the amount of computations necessary to calculate the infimum of the maximum of the functions in Gk for the decomposition ΓDk considerably when compared to the number computations given in [\cite=Y] to calculate the infimum of the maximum of the functions in [formula] for the decomposition [formula] (see [\cite=Y]). We prove the statements below:

Let [formula] be defined by [formula], where {fi} for i∈Ik is the set of functions listed in and d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Then we have inf ∈Δd - 1Fk(  ·  3k - 1 - 3 for k  ≥  2.

Let [formula] be a point at which Fk takes its minimum value α*. Assume that k = 2. Consider the cycles τ1 = (1 12)(2 10)(3 11)(4 5)(8 9), τ2 = (1 9)(2 8)(3 7)(4 6)(10 12) and τ3 = (1 5)(2 6)(3 4)(7 8)(11 12) in the symmetric group S12. Note that τ1(I1) = I4, τ1(Il) = Il for l = 2,3, τ2(I1) = I3, τ2(Il) = Il for l = 2,4 and, τ3(I1) = I2, τ3(Il) = Il for l = 3,4.

Let [formula] be the transformation with the formula xi  ↦  xτl(i) for l = 1,2,3. Clearly we have Tl(Δ11) = Δ11 for any l. Let [formula] be the function so that [formula]. Since fi(Tl(τl(i)( for every [formula] for every ∈Δ11 for every l (see the formulas in ([\ref=deffs])), we derive that F2(l( for every ∈Δ11 for every l. We know by that * is unique, ie T- 1l(*) = * for l = 1,2,3.

For l = 1, we find that x*1 = x*12, x*2 = x*10, x*3 = x*11, x*4 = x*5, x*8 = x*9. For l = 2,3 we have x*1 = x*5 = x*9, x*2 = x*3 = x*4 = x*6 = x*7 = x*8, x*10 = x*11 = x*12 which implies that x*i = x*j = 1 / 12 for every [formula]. Then we compute that F2(*) = α* = 33. This proves the conclusion of the theorem for k = 2.

In the rest of the proof two cases will be considered: k > 2 is even or k is odd. In each case maps analogous to Tl and Hl used above are required. Since their definitions will be similar to Tl and Hl with appropriate dimension changes, we shall not state their formulas explicitly to save space. By abusing the notation for both τl and Tl, for a fixed index Tl will be used to denote all transformations defined by τl. Since we use the equivalence in modulo 4 only, we shall express [formula] with [formula].

Assume that k is even and k > 2. Remember that there are m = ⌈3k - 1 / 4⌉ many elements in I1 which are equivalent to 1 in modulo 4. The same is true for the number of elements equivalent to 2 or 3. But there are n = ⌊3k - 1 / 4⌋ many elements in I1 which are equivalent to 0 in modulo 4. For I2, I3 and I4 we have the table in ([\ref=keven]).

Let Sd denote the symmetric group. For the group of first four sets we assume that i∈I1 and j∈I4. For A5 we assume that i,j∈I2 and, for A6 we assume i,j∈I3. Define the following sets of transpositions in Sd:

[formula]

Let A1 be the set of cycles so that each cycle is formed by the multiplications of m transpositions in A1 whose first entries are in increasing order. Define A2, A3, A5 and A6 in the same way. Similarly, let A4 be the set of cycles formed by the multiplication of n transpositions in A4 whose first entries are in increasing order. Also let

[formula]

Choose one cycle from each set A1, A2,, A10. Consider the multiplication of all of these 10 disjoint cycles. Let Θ1 be the set of all cycles obtained this way. For any element of Θ1, denote it by τ1, we have τ1(I1) = I4, τ1(I2) = I2 and τ1(I3) = I3.

Let Θ2 be the set of cycles formed by the same process given above using the following sets of transpositions and cycles [formula] and [formula] in Sd. Assume for the first four sets that i∈I1 and j∈I3. The entries for the cycles [formula] and [formula] are given by the group of last four sets:

[formula]

For any element of Θ2, denote it by τ2, we see that τ2(I1) = I3, τ2(I2) = I2 and τ2(I4) = I4.

Finally let Θ3 be the set of cycles obtained by the same method used above for Θ1 and Θ2. This time we use the transpositions and cycles [formula] and [formula] below. Assume for the group of first four sets that i∈I1 and j∈I2. For the cycles [formula] and [formula] entries are given by the group of last four sets below:

[formula]

For any element of Θ3, denote it by τ3, we observe that τ3(I1) = I2, τ3(I3) = I3 and τ3(I4) = I4.

By , we have T- 1l(*) = * for every τ1∈Θ1, τ2∈Θ2 and τ3∈Θ3. Therefore for i∈I1 for the first four sets, we conclude that x*i = x*j for each of the following cases separately

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly we have the equalities of entries x*i = x*j for each of the cases listed below:

[formula]

[formula]

We combine the equalities x*i = x*j for the indices given in ([\ref=first])-([\ref=last]). We find that

[formula]

As a result there are two possible values α1 and α2 for α*  =   inf ∈Δd - 1Fk(, where

[formula]

If α1  =  α*  >  α2, we get x*1 < x*4. Since *∈Δd - 1, we have nx*4 + 3mx*1 = 1 / 4, which implies that 1 / x*1 - 1 > 4(n + 3m) - 1. Then we see that

[formula]

where n = ⌊3k - 1 / 4⌋ and m = ⌈3k - 1 / 4⌉. This is a contradiction by . By symmetry the inequality α1  <  α2 also gives a contradiction. So we derive that α1  =  α2 or x*1 = x*4 which shows that xi = xj = 1 / d for every i,j∈Ik and d = 4  ·  3k - 1. Hence the conclusion of the theorem follows in this case.

Assume that k > 2 is odd. In this case there are m = ⌈3k - 1 / 4⌉ many elements in I1 which are equivalent to 1 in modulo 4. There are n = ⌊3k - 1 / 4⌋ many elements each in I1 which are equivalent to 2, 3 or 0 in modulo 4. In other words we obtain the list (m,n,n,n) for the number of elements which are equivalent to 1, 2, 3 or 0, respectively. In I2, I3 and I4 we have the lists in the table ([\ref=kodd]).

We shall use the same sets A1, A2, , A10 of cycles defined above for the even k case, by switching the roles of m and n if necessary, to construct Θ1 the set of cycles formed by the multiplication of cycles chosen one from each set A1, A2, , A10. So for any τ1∈Θ1 we have τ1(I1) = I4, τ1(I2) = I2 and τ1(I3) = I3.

Define Θ2 by using the transpositions and cycles [formula] and [formula] listed below. Assume for the group of first four sets that i∈I2 and j∈I3. For the cycles [formula] and [formula] entries are given by the group of second four sets:

[formula]

Then for any element of τ2∈Θ2 we see that τ2(I2) = I3, τ2(I1) = I1 and τ2(I4) = I4.

For Θ3 we shall use the sets of transpositions described below. For the group of first four sets we assume that i∈I1 and j∈I3. For the group of second four sets we assume that i∈I2 and j∈I4. Let

[formula]

Let B1 and B6 be the sets of cycles so that each cycle in each set is formed by the multiplications of m transpositions in B1 and B6, respectively, whose first entries are in increasing order. Similarly, let B2, B3, B4, B5, B7 and, B8 be the set of cycles formed by the multiplication of n transpositions in B2, B3, B4, B5, B7 and B8, respectively, whose first entries are in increasing order. Choose one cycle from each set B1,, B8. Consider the multiplication of all of these 8 cycles. Let Θ3 be the set of all these disjoint cycles. Then for any element of τ3∈Θ3 we have τ3(I1) = I3 and τ3(I2) = I4.

By analogous definitions for Tl and Hl with appropriate dimensions, we derive by that T- 1l(*) = * for every τ1∈Θ1, τ2∈Θ2 and τ3∈Θ3. For i∈I1 this implies the equalities x*i = x*j for the following indices:

[formula]

If we combine all of the equalities x*i = x*j in ([\ref=third]), we find that

[formula]

This means that there are three possible values α1, α2 and α3 for α* at *, where

[formula]

[formula]

Assume that α1  =  α*  >  α2  ≥  α3. Then we conclude that x*1 < x*2  ≤  x*4. Since *∈Δd - 1, we have the equality mx*1 + 2nx*2 + nx*4 = 1 / 4, which implies that 1 / x*1 - 1 > 4(m + 3n) - 1. Then we find that α1 > 12(m + 3n) - 3  ≥  12  ·  3k - 1 - 3. This is a contradiction by . Because of symmetry we obtain a contradiction in any case unless α1  =  α2  =  α3, which implies that x*1 = x*2 = x*4. In other words, we get x*i = x*j = 1 / d for every i,j∈Ik and d = 4  ·  3k - 1. An elementary computation verifies the conclusion of the theorem in this case as well.

Let [formula] be defined by [formula], where Gk is the set of functions in . Then inf ∈Δd - 1Gk(  ·  3k - 1 - 3.

The displacement functions gk,1i( for i∈Ik are produced by the group-theoretical relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 with length(γs(γ)) = 1 (see and ). Therefore, S(γ) contains 3  ·  3k - 1 many isometries. Since [formula], where p is the mapping defined in ([\ref=Enum]), we calculate that gk,1i(*) = (4  ·  3k - 1 - 1) / 3 < α* for every i∈Ik.

The functions in the union [formula] are produced by the relations (γ,s(γ),S(γ)) so that 2  ≤  length(γs(γ)) = m  ≤  k. For each group of functions in the union above S(γ) contains 4  ·  3k - 1 - 3k - m many isometries, respectively. This implies that the sums in the formulas of these functions contain 4  ·  3k - 1 - 3k - m many summands. Then we see that Gk(*) = Fk(*) because, by direct calculations we have [formula] for every [formula]. Since Fk  ⊂  Gk, we have Gk(  ≥  Fk( for every ∈Δd - 1. Hence, the conclusion of the theorem follows.

Proof of The Main Theorem

Finally we present a proof of the main result of this paper. Although the proof goes along the same lines as the proof of [\cite=Y], we include the details for the sake of completeness.

Let ξ and η be two non-commuting isometries of [formula]. Suppose that ξ and η generate a torsion-free discrete group Γ which is not co-compact and contains no parabolic. Let Γk and αk denote the set of isometries of length at most [formula] in Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 and the real number 12  ·  3k - 1 - 3, respectively. Then for any [formula] we have

[formula]

We have the following two cases: ([\ref=I]) Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is geometrically infinite, or ([\ref=II]) Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is geometrically finite. Assume that the prior is the case.

We know by [\cite=CSParadox] that Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is a free group on the generators ξ and η. Then it can be decomposed as in ([\ref=symm.d.]). Let ΓDk be the symmetric decomposition of Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 so that Dk = (Ψk,Ψkr), where [formula]. Since Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is geometrically infinite, and imply the conclusion of the theorem in this case:

[formula]

Above [formula], where p and mp(ψ) are the bijection and the total measures defined in ([\ref=Enum]) and , respectively. The function Gk is defined in ([\ref=G]).

Assume that Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is geometrically finite. Let [formula] denote the character variety [formula]. Let [formula] be the open subset of [formula], consisting of (ξ,η) such that 〈ξ,η〉 is free, geometrically finite and without any parabolic. Then (ξ,η) is in [formula]. We define the function [formula] such that for a fixed [formula]. The function fkz0 is continuous and proper. Therefore, it takes a minimum value at some point [formula]. We claim that (ξ0,η0) is in [formula].

Assume on the contrary that [formula]. Since Γ  =  〈ξ,η〉 is torsion-free, each isometry γ∈Γk has infinite order. This implies that γ  ·  z  ≠  z for every [formula]. In particular, we get γ  ·  z0  ≠  z0 for any γ∈Γk. Therefore, there exists hyperbolic geodesic segments joining z0 to γ  ·  z0 for every γ∈Ψkr. Note that, since we have 0,γ1γ2  ·  z0) = γ- 11  ·  z0,γ2  ·  z0) and (z0, γ  ·  z0) = (z0, γ- 1  ·  z0), all of the hyperbolic displacements under the isometries in Γk are realised by the geodesic line segments joining the points [formula].

Let us enumerate the elements of Ψkr for some index set I in [formula]. Let P0 = z0 and Pi  =  γi  ·  z0 for every i∈I. Let [formula] denote the geodesic triangle with vertices Pi, P0 and Pj. The value fkz0(ξ0,η0) is the unique longest side length of Δij for some i,j∈I. We shall denote these geodesic triangles with [formula] and their vertices by [formula], P0 and [formula]. There are two cases to consider: (1) all of [formula] are acute or (2) there exists at least one [formula] which is not acute.

Assume that the latter (2) is the case (In the rest of the argument we shall use figures from k = 2 case for illustrations). Fix one of the non-acute geodesic triangles [formula] and denote it by Δ. If [formula] lies in γ, we let P(l)i be a sequence of points in the interior of γ so that [formula]. Let γ denote the longest edge of Δ. By the hyperbolic law of sines, γ is opposite to the non-acute angle. Let [formula] and P(l)0 = P0 for every [formula]. Otherwise, we let P(l)j be a sequence of points in the interior of γ so that [formula] and define [formula] and P(l)0 = P0 for every [formula].

Let Δl be the geodesic triangle contained in Δ with vertices P(l)0, P(l)i and P(l)j. By the construction, the unique longest side γl of Δl is contained in γ for all but finitely many l. Let {ξl} be a sequence of isometries such that ξl  →  ξ0 and ξ- 1l  ·  z0 = P(l)i. Similarly, let {ηl} be a sequence of isometries such that ηl  →  η0 and ηl  ·  z0 = P(l)j. Then we have [formula] for all but finitely many l and fkz0(ξl,ηl) = length(γl) < fkz0(ξ0,η0), a contradiction.

Assume that all of Δij are acute (1). Fix one of Δij and call it Δ. Then the perpendicular arc γi from [formula] to the geodesic containing P0 and [formula] meets it in the interior of the edge of Δ opposite to [formula]. Let P(l)i be a sequence of points in the interior of γi so that [formula]. For each l, we see that [formula] by applying the hyperbolic law of cosines to the right triangle containing P(l)i, P0 and a sub-arc of γi. Similarly, we have [formula].

The geodesic triangle Δ(l)i with vertices P0, P(l)i and [formula] is itself acute. This is because its angles at P0 and [formula] are less than those of Δ. Also the angle of Δ at [formula] is the limit of the angles at P(l)i. This implies that the perpendicular arc γ(l)i from [formula] to the geodesic containing P0 and P(l)i meets this geodesic inside of Δ(l)i. Let P(l)j be the point on γ(l)j at distance 1 / l from [formula]. We find that [formula] and [formula] by the hyperbolic law of cosines. As a result we obtain a triangle with vertices at P0, P(l)i and P(l)j so that all edge lengths are less than those of Δ. Let {ξl} and {ηl} be the sequences such that ξ- 1l  ·  z0 = P(l)i and ηl  ·  z0 = P(l)j. Then we have fkz0(ξl,ηl) < fkz0(ξ0,η0) for all but finitely many l, a contradiction. So the claim is proved.

We know that the set of (ξ,η) such that 〈ξ,η〉 is free, geometricly infinite and without parabolics is dense in [formula]. We also know that every [formula] with 〈ξ,η〉 is free and without parabolic is in [formula] [\cite=CSParadox]. This reduces geometrically finite case to geometrically infinite case. Finally, the conclusion of the theorem follows from the fact that [formula].

Notice that all of the arguments used in this paper to prove can be carried out in a more general setting; in particular in the case [formula] is a purely loxodromic, finitely generated free Kleinian group for n  ≥  2. In fact we can propose

If Γk,n is the set of all isometries of length at most k  ≥  2 in Γ, then [formula] for any [formula].

We conclude this paper with a proof sketch for this conjecture. Details of the arguments outlined below will be left to the future studies.

We consider the cases in ([\ref=I]) and ([\ref=II]). In the case [formula] is geometrically infinite, we use symmetric decomposition ΓDk,n of Γ, where Dk,n = (Ψk,n,Ψk,nr) is defined in (). Above Ψk,n is the set of words of length k and Ψk,nr is the set of words of length less than k.

Let d = 2n  ·  (2n - 1)k - 1 and [formula]. It is possible to prove an analog of stating that there are d  ·  Rk,n many group-theoretical relations for the decomposition ΓDk,n. Using these group-theoretical relations an analog of can be stated. This gives the decomposition of the area measure Az0 corresponding to the symmetric decomposition ΓDk,n of Γ. Then using we prove an analog of which provides a set Gk,n of d  ·  Rk,n many displacement functions so that only a set Fk,n of d many of which are significant to compute the infimum of the maximum of the functions in Gk,n on the simplex Δd - 1.

As in and [\ref=minG] the lower bounds proposed in the conjecture are a consequence of the uniqueness of the point *∈Δd - 1 at which the infimum of the maximum of the displacement functions in Fk,n is attained. The uniqueness of * is implied by a statement similar to stating that there exists a strictly convex set C in Δd - 1 containing * such that each displacement function in Fk,n is strictly convex on C. Since the infimum of the maximum of the functions in Fk,n is itself convex on C, the uniqueness of * follows from some standard facts in convex analysis. Using all of the bijections of Δd - 1 fixing the set Fn,k we derive that all of the coordinates of * are equal. Then a simple computation gives the lower bounds in the conjecture completing the proof in the case ([\ref=I]).

In the case ([\ref=II]) [formula] is geometrically finite, the assertion of the conjecture can be proved along the same lines as in the proof of .
