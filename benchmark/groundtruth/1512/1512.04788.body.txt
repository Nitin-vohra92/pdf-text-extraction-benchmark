Hamming distances from a function to all codewords of a Generalized Reed-Muller code of order one

Introduction

Generalized Reed-Muller codes of order 1

Let [formula] be the finite field with q elements. For any integer m  ≥  1, we will identify [formula] with [formula] as follows: consider a basis [formula] of [formula] over [formula], then an element [formula] will be identified with the vector [formula] if and only if, [formula].

If [formula] and [formula], are two elements of [formula] we will denote by u.v their product in the field [formula] and by 〈u,v〉 their scalar product

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the set of functions from [formula] to [formula]. Each function f∈F(q,m) can be identified with its image [formula]. We know that these functions are polynomial functions of m variables. The kernel of the map which associates to any polynomial the corresponding polynomial function is the ideal I generated by the m polynomials Xqi  -  Xi. The reduced polynomials are the polynomials [formula] such that for each i, the partial degree [formula] of [formula] with respect to the variable Xi is ≤  q - 1. Then for any f∈F(q,m) there exists an unique reduced polynomial [formula] for which f is the associated polynomial function. The total degree of [formula] is called the degree of f and denoted by deg (f).

With these notations, the Generalized Reed-Muller code of order 1 is the set

[formula]

If f,g∈F(q,m), the Hamming distance between these two functions is defined by

[formula]

Organization of the article

In this article we study the Hamming distances from a function f∈F(q,m) to all the codewords g∈RM(1)(q,m).

An adapted transform

It is known that every codeword g∈RM(1)(q,m) can be characterized by a pair [formula] in the following sense:

[formula]

If f∈F(q,m) and g as above, we have that

[formula]

where [formula].

Now the problem is to study the integer numbers N(v,t)(f). In order to do that, we will introduce a transform on the group algebra [formula] of the additive group [formula] over the complex field [formula] which is quite similar to a Fourier Transform.

More precisely, [formula] is the algebra of formal linear combinations with coefficients in [formula]

[formula]

where the operations are defined by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let G(q,m) be the algebra of functions from [formula] (or from [formula]) into [formula]. It is a vector space of dimension qm + 1 over [formula]. Let us define an order on [formula] and define the family [formula] of elements of G(q,m) where

[formula]

This family is a basis of G(q,m) and has qm + 1 elements.

Define the operator T(q,m) of the [formula]-vector space G(q,m) by

[formula]

In the case where the function φ is given by φ(v) = Zf(v) for some f∈F(q,m), then the transform introduced above is the same that the the one introduced by Ashikhmin and Litsyn (see [\cite=a-l]). We recall here some basic properties of this transform, for more details see [\cite=rol].

The transform of eu,t by T(q,m) is given by

[formula]

then

[formula]

where E- u,t is the hyperplane of F(q,m)  ×  Fq defined by

[formula]

Let γa∈G(q,m) be defined by γa(u) = Z〈a,u〉, then the transform of γa is given by

[formula]

We have successively

[formula]

If v = a we have that T(q,m)(γa)(v) = qmZ0 and then, when v  ≠  a, for each [formula], the equation 〈a - v,u〉 = t defines a hyperplane and consequently has qm - 1 solutions.

Let φ be an element of G(q,m), we denote by ψ  =  T(q,m)(φ) its transform, and by θ = T(q,m)(ψ) its double transform.

With the previous notations we have

[formula]

We have that

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=gamma] we obtain

[formula]

The Lemma follows from the equality above and from the fact that:

[formula]

We want to characterize the kernel of T(q,m), in order to do that, we need the following lemma:

A function φ∈G(q,m) verifies

[formula]

for each [formula] if, and only if,

[formula]

where λ is a function from [formula] into [formula].

Let φ be given by [formula] then we have

[formula]

If this product is equal to zero, then

[formula]

On the other hand a direct computation of

[formula]

shows the converse.

Now we can determine the kernel of T(q,m).

The kernel of Tq,m is the subspace of the functions φ such that for each [formula]

[formula]

where λ is any function from [formula] into [formula] verifying

[formula]

The dimension of the kernel is qm - 1.

Note that if the transform of φ is the zero function, then using the Proposition [\ref=double] we get

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=pro]

[formula]

Hence, for each [formula] we must have

[formula]

If we denote by ψ the transform of φ we know that

[formula]

The result follows. Let us remark that the functions λ such that

[formula]

defines an hyperplane of the space of functions from [formula] into [formula] and then, the dimension of the kernel is qm - 1.

The functions

[formula]

with [formula] are a basis of the kernel Ker(T(q,m)), where

[formula]

The functions ea,t with

[formula]

is a basis of a complement of Ker(Tq,m).

For any [formula] the following holds:

[formula]

with λ(0) = 1, λ(a) =  - 1 and λ(v) = 0 for the other values of v, then by Theorem [\ref=kernel] δa is in the kernel of T(q,m). As the ea,t are linearly independent, the δa are linearly independent. We conclude that the δa constitute a basis of Ker(T(q,m)).

Let I be the set

[formula]

and φ the function

[formula]

The following holds:

[formula]

If v  ≠  0 then

[formula]

Then T(q,m)(φ)(v) cannot be a multiple of [formula] unless all the λv,t are zero for v  ≠  0 and in this case the coefficient of [formula] is 0. Now if v = 0 then

[formula]

Then T(q,m)(φ)(0) cannot be a multiple of [formula] unless all the λ0,t have the same value λ0 and in this case the coefficient of [formula] is λ0. Hence, if T(q,m)(φ)(v) can be written [formula], we have [formula]. Then, if φ∈Ker(T(q,m)), for any (v,t)∈I we have λv,t = 0. We conclude that the qm + 1 - (qm - 1) linearly independent vectors (ev,t)(v,t)∈I constitute a basis of a complement of Ker(T(q,m)).

The vectors εv,t = T(q,m)(ev,t) with (v,t)∈I are linearly independent. They constitute a basis of the image T(q,m)(G(q,m)).

Application to the Hamming distances from a function to all codewords of a Generalized Reed-Muller code of order 1

System of equations satisfied by the distances of a function to all codewords

Coming back to our problem, if f∈F(q,m) let us associate to it the function F∈G(q,m) defined by

[formula]

The transform T(q,m)(F) is given by

[formula]

where [formula] as defined before.

Pour any [formula]the following formula holds:

[formula]

It is a direct consequence of the equalities ([\ref=nvt]). Indeed the total sum of coefficients in the first expression is qm and in the second one it is [formula].

As one can see, the numbers Nv,t(f) are exactly the coefficients of T(q,m)(F) where F is associated to f as above.

For each [formula] we consider the linear form Lw defined over [formula] by

[formula]

and for each [formula] and each [formula] we consider the hyperplane Ew,τ of [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let f∈F(q,m), then Nv,t(f) are solutions of the following linear system with qm + 1 equations on qm + 1 variables where the equation numbered (w,τ) is:

Computing T2(q,m)(F), where F = Zf and by using the result of Theorem [\ref=double], we obtain

[formula]

Denoting [formula] and observing that

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, if we compute T2(q,m)(F) using that

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

The theorem follows by comparing the two expressions obtained for T2(q,m)(F).

The system presented in Theorem [\ref=sys] has the following structure: it is constituted by qm blocks Bw of q equations. The block Bw contains the q equations numbered (w,τ) where w is fixed and τ takes the q possible values in [formula]. Each equation of a block involves qm variables, namely the variables indexed by the points (v,t) of the hyperplane Ew,τ of [formula]. The q hyperplanes Ew,τ (w fixed, [formula]) are parallel, then each variable xv,t is in one and only one equation of each block Bw.

Let us consider the basis defined in section [\ref=sec:transform] by ([\ref=base]). Remark that the matrix of the system ([\ref=sys]) is the matrix T(q,m) of T(q,m) with respect to the considered basis. Namely by construction (see the proof of Theorem [\ref=sys]), the system can be written

[formula]

where X is the column

[formula]

and B the column

[formula]

where

[formula]

The system has a solution because we know that the values Nv,t(f) constitute a solution. But, as the linear map T(q,m) has a kernel, the system has not a unique solution. However, if we add some "normalization" conditions we obtain the desired solution.

The numbers Nv,t(f) are the unique solution of the system that appears on the Theorem [\ref=sys] if we join the following qm equations

[formula]

We know that any other solution is obtained from the previous solution [formula] by adding an element in the kernel of the transformation, that is any other solution has the form [formula] with [formula]. For any v fix, we have that [formula] and the result follows from it.

Transformation into a Cramer linear system

The system (S) constructed in the following way:

suppress from the system ([\ref=sys]) the qm - 1 lines numbered (w,0) with w  ≠  0,

replace these equations by the qm - 1 equations [formula], where w  ≠  0,

is a Cramer linear system and has [formula] for unique solution.

Let T(q,m) the matrix of the original system. The columns are the vectors T(q,m)(ev,t) = εv,t decomposed on the basis [formula].

Let us consider the columns (v,t) for which one of the two following conditions holds:

v = 0;

[formula].

Denote by I these indexes. We know by Lemma [\ref=corokern] that these qm + 1 - (qm - 1) columns are linearly independent.

Denote by a(w,τ),(v,t) the coefficient of T(q,m) which is at the line indexed by (w,τ) and the column indexed by (v,t). This coefficient is the component of δv,t on ew,τ, namely by Lemma [\ref=evt]:

[formula]

But as the relation (w,τ)∈E- v,t is equivalent to (v,t)∈Ew,τ we have

[formula]

Then the elements of line ((w,τ) are the elements of the column ( - w,τ) By Proposition [\ref=kern] the qm + 1 - (qm - 1) lines indexed by (w,τ) where w  ≠  0 and t  ≠  0, or w = 0, are linearly independent.

Remark that the original system has a vector space of dimension qm - 1 of solutions [formula]. Adding all equations of the system gives the following equality:

[formula]

Then if we suppose that the qm - 1 conditions

[formula]

where v  ≠  0, are satisfied, the last condition

[formula]

is also satisfied. Now, using Theorem [\ref=ajout], we conclude that (S) is a Cramer linear System.

From the definition it follows that

[formula]

So, it would be interesting to consider the arrangement of hyperplanes A(f), consisting of the qm hyperplanes Ew,f( - w) and to relate the geometric and combinatorial properties of A(f) to the properties of the distance between f and the affine functions. A very simple example is the following: if the arrangement A(f) is centered, then there is a (v,t) such that Nv,t = qm and consequently the function f is affine.
