On the polar decomposition of right Linear operators in Quaternionic Hilbert spaces

Introduction

The polar decomposition of an operator is a generalization of the polar decomposition of a non zero complex number. If T is a bounded linear operator between complex Hilbert spaces H and K, then

[formula]

for some partial isometry U0 with the initial space [formula], the orthogonal complement of the null space of T, a subspace of H and the final space [formula], the closure of the range of T, which is a subspace of K. Here |T| is the square root of (T*T). Further, the partial isometry is unique if the null spaces of T and U0 are same. This factorization with the unique partial isometry U0 is called the of T. This decomposition enable us to know the properties of T by knowing the properties of the positive operator |T|. It is known that the polar decomposition of a bounded operator defined between two complex Hilbert spaces always exist [\cite=Halmos]. The case of unbounded densely defined closed operator can be found in [\cite=Pedersen].

In a recent article W. Ichinose and K. Iwashita gave a necessary and sufficient condition for any decomposition as in Equation ([\ref=polarform]) of bounded linear operator between complex Hilbert spaces to be the polar decomposition [\cite=ichinose].

The polar decomposition of a bounded linear operator on a quaternionic Hilbert space is discussed in [\cite=Ghiloni]. This result for the unbounded case is not found in the literature. In this article, we use quaternionic version of the bounded transform (see [\cite=Alpay] for details ) to establish the existence of the polar decomposition of densely defined closed right linear operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

We also prove the result similar to that of Ichinose [\cite=ichinose] for the case of densely defined closed right linear operators defined in a separable quaternionic Hilbert space. First we prove this for bounded operators by associating a 2  ×  2 matrix of complex operators for a given quaternionic operator. This technique for the case of quaternion matrices can be found in Brenner and Lee [\cite=Brenner] and for bounded operators on [formula] in [\cite=Feng]. Though every separable Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic with [formula], the decomposition of the quaternion [formula] space into complex [formula] space is easy compared to the general space. To deal this general case we need to use the decomposition of the quaternionic Hilbert space into slice complex Hilbert spaces. Once this setting is done, all the results can be proved easily. In doing so, we give proofs of some results of [\cite=Feng] for the separable Hilbert space.

Later, we prove the result for densely defined closed right linear operators defined in a separable quaternionic Hilbert space.

We organize this article in five sections. In the second section we fix some of the notations, recall some basic properties of the ring of quaternions, definitions and some results in quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

In the third section we prove the existence of square root of unbounded positive right linear operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

In the fourth section we prove the existence of the polar decomposition of densely defined closed right linear operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

In the fifth section we give necessary and sufficient condition for a decomposition as in Equation ([\ref=polarform]), to be the polar decomposition. In this case, we assume the operator is defined in a separable quaternionic Hilbert space.

Notations and Prelimanaries

Let [formula] denotes the ring of all real quaternions. If [formula], then q  =  q0 + q1i + q2j + q3k, where [formula], for each [formula]. Here i,j,k satisfy For [formula], the conjugate of q is [formula]. For [formula], we have [formula] and [formula]. The real part of [formula] is denoted by Re([formula] and the imaginary part of [formula] is denoted by Im([formula] The set [formula] is called the imaginary unit sphere. For [formula] is called a slice of [formula]. Here [formula] is isomorphic to the complex field [formula] by the mapping α  +  mβ  →  α  +  iβ.

[\cite=Ghiloni] Let H be a right [formula] module. A map satisfying:

If u∈H, then [formula]

[formula], for all u,v∈H and [formula]

[formula], for all u,v∈H,

is called an inner product on H. If we define [formula], for all u∈H, then [formula] is a norm on H and it is called the norm induced by [formula]. If [formula] is complete space then it is called a right quaternionic Hilbert space.

Let H be a right quaternionic Hilbert space. If H has a countable dense subset then H is called separable.

[\cite=Alpay] A map T:D(T)  →  H with the domain D(T)  ⊆  H is said to be a right [formula] linear operator if The null space of T is defined by and the range space of T is defined by

[\cite=Alpay] Let T:D(T)  →  H be right [formula]- linear operator. The graph of T is denoted by G(T) and it is defined by The operator T is called

closed, if G(T) is closed in H  ×  H. Equivalently, if (xn)  ⊂  D(T) with (xn) converges to x∈H such that Txn converges to y∈H then x∈D(T) and Tx = y.

densely defined, if [formula]. (Here [formula] denotes the closure D(T)).

[\cite=Alpay] Let T:D(T)  →  H be densely defined right [formula]- linear operator. Then there exists a unique right [formula]- linear opearator denoted by T* with the domain such that [formula], for every y∈D(T),x∈D(T*). This operator T* is called the adjoint of T.

[\cite=Alpay] Let T:D(T)  →  H be densely defined closed operator. Then

T* is closed

[formula] and [formula].

By the closed graph theorem, if T:D(T)  →  H is closed with D(T)  =  H, then T must be bounded.

Let T:D(T)  →  H and S:D(S)  →  H be right [formula]- linear operators. Then we say that S  ⊆  T if D(S)  ⊆  D(T) and Sx  =  Tx, for all x∈D(S).

Furthermore

ST is defined with the domain D(ST)  =  {x∈D(T):Tx∈D(S)} such that ST(x)  =  S(Tx), for all x∈D(ST).

S + T is defined with the domain [formula] such that S + T(x)  =  Sx  +  Tx, for all x∈D(S + T).

[\cite=Ghiloni] Let T:D(T)  →  H be densely defined right [formula]- linear. Then T is said to be

self-adjoint if T  =  T*

positive if T = T* and [formula], for all x∈D(T)

anti self-adjiont if T*  =   - T

normal if T closed and TT*  =  T*T

unitary if D(T)  =  H and T*T  =  TT*  =  I.

Let T:D(T)  →  H be right [formula]- linear. Then T commutes with bounded right linear operator B on H if and only if TB  ⊆  BT. That is TBx  =  BTx, for all x∈D(T).

[\cite=Ghiloni] Let T:H  →  H be right [formula]- linear. Then T is bounded or continuous, if there exists K > 0 such that We denote the set of all bounded right [formula]- linear operators on H by B(H). If T∈B(H), then is finite and it is called the norm of T.

Let T∈B(H). Then T is said to be

isometry if [formula]

partial isometry if [formula]. The space [formula] called the initial space and the space R(T) called the final space of T.

orthogonal projection onto closed subspace W if T = T*,  T2 = T and R(T) = W. We denote this by T  =  PW.

We recall existence of square root of bounded positive operator on quaternionic Hilbert space, which is given in [\cite=Ghiloni].

If T∈B(H) and T is positive. Then there exists a unique operator in B(H), indicated by [formula], such that [formula] is positive and [formula]. Furthermore, it turns out that [formula] commutes with every bounded operator which commutes with T.

Where as, we prove the existence of square roof of unbounded positive opeartor in quaternionic Hilbert spaces (for details, see Theorem [\ref=strictlysqareroot] of section 3).

Slice Hilbert space:

Given any quaternionic Hilbert space H and an anti self-adjoint unitary operator J on H there exists a complex Hilbert space called the slice Hilbert space, defined as follows:

[\cite=Ghiloni] Let [formula] and J∈B(H) be an anti self-adjoint and unitary operator. Then is called a slice Hilbert space.

[\cite=Ghiloni] Let H and J be as in Definition [\ref=slice]. Then

HJm±  ≠  {0} and the restriction of the inner product [formula] to HJm± is complex valued. Therefore HJm± is [formula] - Hilbert space.

Square root of an unbounded positve operator

In this section we prove the existence of square root of an unbounded right linear positive operator.

Let T:D(T)  →  H be positive. Then there exists a unique positive square root of T. Moreover, it commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with T.

This proof is based on [\cite=Wouk]. We devide this proof into two cases. First we prove the result when T is strictly positive, later we prove it for positive operator.

Case(1): Assume that T is strictly positive. Then By the Caucy-Schwarz inequality [\cite=Ghiloni], we have

[formula]

Since T is positive and bounded below by Equation (), we conclude that T- 1 exists and it is bounded. Moreover, T- 1 is positive

Let S: = T- 1. By [\cite=Ghiloni], S has unique positive square root [formula] with [formula]. Moreover, [formula] commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with S. Since S commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with T, so does [formula]. Clearly [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is one to one from H onto [formula]. Thus [formula] has unbounded inverse say C with domain [formula]. We show that D(C2)  =  D(T) and C2  =  T. If x∈D(T) then Tx  =  y implies [formula], hence C2x  =  y. Therefore D(T)  ⊆  D(C2).

Conversely if x∈D(C2) then y: = Cx∈D(C). That is [formula] and C2x  =  Cy  =  z. This implies [formula] and [formula]. Thus z  =  Tx. This shows that D(T)  =  D(C2) and [formula], for all x∈D(T). In fact C is positive

As T is strictly positive, T is invertible so is C. Since C being positive and invertible, it must be strictly positive.

Since C commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with [formula] so C commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with T. It is enough to show the uniqueness. If L is any positive square root of T then for all x∈D(T) So L has a bounded inverse which is positive. Then (L- 1)2Tx  =  x, for all x∈D(T), where as T(L- 1)2x  =  x, for all x∈H. Thus S  =  (L- 1)2. By the uniqueness of square root of S, we have [formula]. Therefore L  =  C.

Case(2): Assume that T is positive. Define We show that S is a bounded positive operator. Since T is positive I + T is bounded below. That is Then (I + T)- 1 exists and it is bounded with [formula]. The operator S can be represented as By using above representation, we show that S is bounded positive operator

By Case (1), the operator I + T has positive square root say C, which commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with I + T. Hence C commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with (I + T)- 1. Since S commutes with I + T so it commutes with both (I + T)- 1 and C. It is clear that D(C2)  =  D(I + T)  =  D(T). Thus for every x∈D(T), we have

Since [formula] is positive operator, we conclude that [formula] is positive square root of T. Also it commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with T. The uniqueness of square root follows same as in the Case (1).

Let T:D(T)  →  H be right [formula] - linear operator. Then there exists a unique posiitive square root of T*T called modulus of T denoted by |T|. Moreover, |T| commutes with every bounded operator that commutes with T.

It is clear that T*T is positive operator, that is Hence the result follows from Theorem [\ref=strictlysqareroot].

Existence of polar decomposition

In this section we prove the existence of polar decomposition of a densely defined closed right [formula]- linear operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space (see Theorem [\ref=Existence]).

We recall the notion of the polar decomposition of a bounded linear operator on complex Hilbert spaces.

[\cite=Pedersen] If H is complex Hilbert space and let A:H  →  H be bounded. Then there is a unique partial isometry U0:H  →  H with N(U0)  =  N(A) and A  =  U0|A| . In particular, U*0U0|A|  =  |A|,U*0A  =  |A|, and U0U*0A = A.

Through out this article U0 represents patial isometry as in Theorem [\ref=classical], the polar decomposition. Now we recall existence of polar decomposition of bounded right linear operator on quaternionic Hilbert spaces [\cite=Ghiloni].

[\cite=Ghiloni] Let T∈B(H). Then there exists, and are unique, two operators W and P in B(H) such that:

T = WP

P  ≥  0

N(P)  ⊆  N(W),  ( in fact N(P)  =  N(W))

W is isometry on [formula] ; that is, [formula], for every [formula].

Furthermore, W and P have the following additional properties:

P  =  |T|

If T is normal, then W defines a unitary operator in [formula]

If T is normal, then W commutes with |T| and with all the operators in B(H) commuting with both T and T*.

If T is self-adjoint, then W is self-adjoint

If T is anti self-adjoint, then W is anti self-adjoint.

A densely defined closed right [formula]- linear operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space H can be transformed to a bounded linear operator on H via the bounded transform.

[\cite=Alpay] Let T:D(T)  →  H be densely defined closed right linear operator in H. The operator [formula] has the following properties:

[formula] and [formula]

Z*T  =  ZT*

If T is normal, then ZT is normal.

If T:D(T)  →  H be densely defined closed right [formula]- linear operator, then N(ZT) = N(T) and R(ZT) = R(T).

By the definition of ZT, we have R(ZT)  ⊆  R(T). Since [formula], we have R(T)  ⊆  R(ZT). Similarly we have R(T*)  =  R(Z*T). Hence N(T)  =  N(ZT).

Let T:D(T)  →  H be densely defined closed right [formula]- linear operator with D(T)  ⊂  H. Then there exists a partial isometry U0 with initial space [formula] and final space [formula] such that T  =  U0|T|. In particular U0 satisfying N(|T|)  =  N(U0) is uniquely determined. Moreover,

If T is normal, then U0 is unitary operator in [formula]

If T is normal, then U0 commutes with |T| and with all operators in B(H) commuting with both T and T*

If T is self-adjoint, then also U0

If T is anti self-adjoint, then also U0.

It is clear from Theorem [\ref=boundedtransform] that ZT is bounded. By Theorem [\ref=boundedexistence], there exists a unique partial isometry U0 with initial space [formula], final space [formula] such that ZT  =  U0|ZT| and N(|ZT|)  =  N(U0). Since |T|  =  |ZT|(I - Z*TZT), we have

[formula]

Hence T  =  U0|T|. By Lemma [\ref=null] and Theorem [\ref=boundedexistence](iii) it follows that N(|T|)  =  N(U).

Proof of ([\ref=normalpolar]): If T is normal then by Theorem [\ref=boundedtransform](3), we have ZT is normal. By Theorem [\ref=boundedexistence](b), U0 is unitary operator in [formula].

Proof of ([\ref=commutingpolarnormal]): Since ZT is normal, by Theorem [\ref=boundedexistence](c), U0 commutes with |ZT| and with all operators in B(H) commuting with both ZT and Z*T. We conclude the result by using the fact that |T| commutes with |ZT|.

Proof of ([\ref=selfadjpolar]): If T is self-adjoint then by Theorem [\ref=boundedtransform](2), ZT is self-adjoint. By Theorem [\ref=boundedexistence](d), we have U0 is self-adjoint.

Proof of ([\ref=antiselfpolar]): If T is anti self-adjoint, then

[formula]

Hence by Theorem [\ref=boundedexistence](e), we get U0 is anti self-adjoint.

Let T:D(T)  →  H be right [formula]- linear normal operator which is densely defined and closed. Let T  =  V|T| be the polar decomposition as in Theorem [\ref=Existence]. Then

V is normal

there exists a unitary W such that T = W|T|.

Since T is normal operator, N(T)  =  N(T*). We use this fact in proving the result.

Proof of (1): We know that V is partial isometry. This implies Proof of (2): Clearly [formula] is an isometry such that T = V|T|. If we define W as

[formula]

then W is unitary. If x∈D(T) then x  =  x1  +  x2, where x1∈N(T) and [formula]. Moreover, Hence the result.

uniqueness of polar decomposition

In this section we give necessary and sufficient condition for any decomposition of densely defined closed right [formula]- linear operator in quaternionic Hilbert space H  ( see Theorem [\ref=unboundedunique]) as in Equation ([\ref=polarform]) to be the polar decomposition. Throughout this section we assume H to be separable.

First, we prove the result for bounded right [formula]- linear operators on H and then extend it to the unbounded case.

In case of complex Hilbert spaces the uniqueness of decomposition of bounded linear operator is given in [\cite=ichinose]. In detail, let A be a bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert space with

[formula]

where U is a partial isometry. In this case U may not be unique. For example let P be an orthogonal projection onto N(A), and [formula] be a partial isometry. Then U = U0  +  VP also satisfy Equation ([\ref=decomposition]). In fact, it is proved in [\cite=ichinose] that any partial isometry U satisfying Equation ([\ref=decomposition]) above can be written as U = U0 + VP, where U0 is a partial isometry satisfying Equation([\ref=decomposition]) such that N(U0)  =  N(A). Thus U  =  U0 if and only if N(A)  =  {0} or [formula].

First we prove some results which are needed for our purpose.

Let J∈B(H) be anti self-adjoint and unitary. Suppose {fk}∞k = 1 is an orthonormal basis in H with fk  =  gk  +  hk  ·  n, where {gk}∞k = 1,{hk}∞k = 1  ⊂  HJm+. Then {gk} is an orthonormal basis in HJm+ if and only if hk = 0, for [formula]. Similarly {hk} is an orthonormal basis in HJm+ if and only if gk = 0, for [formula]

Proof is similar to that of [\cite=Feng].

Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis in H and A∈B(H). Then the matrix of A with respect to [formula] is given by [formula], where [formula].

Proof follows in similar lines of [\cite=Feng]

Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis in HJm+. Then for every x∈HJm+, we have [formula]. Then we define the conjugate of x as

If A∈B(HJm+), then [formula]. The conjugate of A is defined by

Moreover if (qrs) is the matrix of A with respect [formula], then [formula] and (qrs  ·  n) represents the matrices of [formula] and A  ·  n respectively.

If x∈H then x  =  x1 + x2  ·  n, where x1,x2∈HJm+.

Let A∈B(H) has the matrix representation, (qrs)  =  (αrs)  +  (βrs)  ·  n with an orthonormal basis [formula]. Then there exists a unique pair of operators A1,A2∈B(HJm+) such that Furthermore, A1,A2 admits matrix representations (αrs),(βrs) with orthonoraml basis [formula], respectively.

Using Lemma [\ref=innerdirect], the proof follows in the similar lines of [\cite=Feng].

Let A∈B(H). Then the adjoint of A is denoted by A* and it is given by

Let A  =  A1 + A2  ·  n∈B(H). Define [formula] by

[formula]

Then [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] Then

[formula]

This ensures that χA is [formula] - linear operator on [formula] It is remains to show that χA is bounded and compute its norm. We have

[formula]

Therefore [formula].

If [formula] with [formula] then [formula] with [formula] and [formula] Therefore Thus [formula]

The map [formula] defined by is an injective [formula]- algebra homomorphism. Here A1,A2∈B(HJm+) are associated to A as in Theorem [\ref=associate].

Let A,B∈B(H) and [formula] Then

[formula]

Next,

[formula]

If ξ(A)  =  0, then [formula] Therefore A  =  0. Also using the fact that ξ(0)  =  0, we can conclude that ξ is injective complex algebra homomorphism.

Let A∈B(H). Then

χA*  =  χ*A

A is self-adjoint ⇔  χA is self-adjoint

A is positive ⇔  χA is positive

A is normal ⇔  χA is normal

A is unitary ⇔  χA is unitary.

A is anti self-adjoint ⇔  χA is anti self-adjoint.

Proof of (1): Let A  =  (ars)  +  (brs)  ·  n be the matrix representation of A, where A1  =  (ars) and A2  =  (brs). Then and We have

[formula]

Proof of (2): From Proposition [\ref=injective] and (1), we have

Proof of (3): For x1,x2∈HJm+, we have

[formula]

Proof of (4): Proof of (5):

[formula]

Proof of (6):

Let A∈B(H). Then,

[formula] and [formula]

[formula] and [formula]

Proof of (1): Let x1  +  x2  ·  n∈H. Then

[formula]

If x1  +  x2  ·  n∈R(A), then x1 + x2  ·  n  =  A(w1 + w2  ·  n), for some w1  +  w2  ·  n∈H. We have

[formula]

Proof of (2): Let y1 + y2  ·  n∈H. Then Similarly,

[formula]

Let A∈B(H). Then

A is orthogonal projection if and only if χA is orthogonal projection

A is partial isometry if and only if χA is partial isometry.

Proof of (1): By Theorem [\ref=comparision] and Proposition [\ref=equivalents],

[formula]

Proof of (2): If A is a partial isometry, then By Lemma [\ref=comparision](2), for every [formula] we have [formula] Therefore

[formula]

We conclude that A is partial isometry if and only if χA is partial isometry.

Let A∈B(H). Suppose U be a partial isometry such that A  =  U|A| and A  =  U0|A| be the polar decomposition of A. Then U  =  U0  +  VP for some partial isometry V and P  =  PN(A).

Proof follows in the similar lines of [\cite=ichinose]

Let A∈B(H) and U be a partial isometry with A  =  U|A|. Then U = U0 if and only if either N(A)  =  {0} or [formula]

Since A  =  U|A|, we have χA  =  χ(U|A|)  =  χU  ·  χ|A|. By Theorem [\ref=iso](2), it is clear that χU is partial isometry. Since |A|2  =  A*A, we have It is clear from [\cite=ichinose], that χU  =  χU0 if and only if either N(χA)  =  {0} or [formula] but Lemma [\ref=comparision] ensures that N(χA)  =  {0} or [formula] if and only if N(A)  =  {0} or [formula] Thus U  =  U0 if and only if either N(A)  =  {0} or [formula]

We give an example of a bounded right [formula]- linear operator A with N(A)  ≠  {0} and N(A*)  ≠  {0} implies there is a partial isometry U such that A  =  U|A| with U  ≠  U0. The Proposition [\ref=frompolar] is also true for densely defined closed right linear operators in H. We examine this with the following example. Now we prove the uniqueness theorem by using the bounded transform.

Let T:D(T)  →  H be closed and densely defined right [formula] linear. Let U be a partial isometry such that T  =  U|T|. Then U = U0 if and only if either N(U) = {0} or [formula]

By Theorem [\ref=boundedtransform], we have

[formula]

a bounded operator with

[formula]

Here we have used the fact that since T*T commute with I + T*T, it commute with [formula]. First, note that [formula] is positive. By the uniqueness of the square root [formula], we have ZT  =  U|ZT|. Applying Theorem [\ref=main] to the bounded right [formula] linear operator ZT, we obtain U = U0 if and only if either N(ZT) = {0} or R(ZT)  =  {0}. By Lemma [\ref=null], U = U0 if and only if either N(T) = {0} or [formula]
