Complementarity in single photon interference - the role of mode functions and vacuum fields

Introduction

Complementarity is one of the most important principles of quantum physics [\cite=Bohr28]. It is directly connected to the “measurement problem” [\cite=Glaub]. In quantum optics light is detected as “clicks” of the single photons, which correspond to the transfer of an energy packet of hvphoton to the detector, with the spatial, temporal, spectral and polarization filter restrictions of the detector setup. The measured intensity of bright light results from the statistical superposition of these "clicks". The possible positions of these "clicks" are given by the interference pattern of the measured light fields. For a single photon this interference is given by the overlay of the electric field components belonging to this photon at the detector. The possibly coherent light fields produce interference fringes resulting in certain visibility V. In some cases the sources of different photons can be distinguished resulting in "which-path" knowledge K. The complementarity principle in quantum optics answers the question: How coherent are the more or less distinguishable shares of the electric field (or how distinguishable are the paths of the more or less coherent light modes)? The upper limit for the combined measurement of both is K2  +  V2   ≤   1 [\cite=Jaeger95]. The visibility is based on the coherence of the involved light modes in the different photon paths. It can be concluded that coherence in single photon measurements decreases if paths become distinguishable [\cite=Man91]. Thus the question about the physical details behind this quantum law of complementarity may be asked. Quite some work was done to investigate the coherence properties of the emitted light from spontaneous down conversion (SPDC). For example the coherence area of the emission was investigated with the result that the source is incoherent across the pump spot indicating a thermal emitter [\cite=Rib94]. This fulfills expectation because SPDC is a spontaneous process. A similar but more detailed result was worked out experimentally and theoretically [\cite=Joob94] [\cite=Joob96]. In [\cite=Joob96] it was shown that especially in polar direction coherence effects from phase matching and other details provide a more complex than thermal behavior of this SPDC light. In these investigations also the correlation between the coherence of the signal and idler photons was analyzed. These correlation and entanglement properties were also investigated in detail in [\cite=Just13] [\cite=Paul13] [\cite=Jost98]. But almost no investigation deals with the physical nature behind this behavior. Therefore we investigated the transversal coherence of a transversal single photon mode generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), experimentally. By observing vanishing visibility the transversal coherence is determined as a function of the separation of the involved measured modes. These modes are, as always, defined by the detection system. We setup the single photon detector for observing transversally a single fundamental Gaussian mode (TEM00), only. Using two shifted arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer we measure the coherence of two tilted Gaussian modes of a single photon selected out of the light cone of SPDC which are emitted from the same volume of the crystal. Because these photon modes are originally induced by vacuum fields via spontaneous parametric down conversion [\cite=Heu14] [\cite=Mil96] the influence of these involved vacuum fields can be obtained. As shown below they can be identified directly as origin for complementarity in this case. These experiments were based on a former set of investigations which showed the role of involved vacuum in SPDC in detail [\cite=Heu14]. In these induced coherence experiment using three crystals the "open" vacuum entrances produced an incoherent background in the single photon interference measurements while the common vacuum entrances of the coupled crystals resulted in single photon interferences of first-order of more than 95 % visibility. The question which photon modes are selected in the certain measurement by the measuring system plays the key role. If, for example as in our case, the detector is constructed as a selector for a TEM00-mode, this mode can be projected towards the sources of this mode, which is the BBO-crystal in SPDC measurements. In type I SPDC generation one common light cone structure for the narrow bandwidth signal and idler photons is emitted as depicted in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. The two entangled photons have opposite momentum components with respect to the pump photon and appear diagonally within this cone.

A Mach-Zehnder interferometer for the single signal photons is applied to investigate the transversal coherence of the selected modes as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]. By transversal tilting one of the interferometers arms in tangential or radial direction and realigning the spots for the detector mode as can be seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig2] the total visibility of the overlapping modes was measured as a function of the distance between the areas signal 1 and signal 2 as depicted in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. Thus the transversal coherence lengths of the measured signal photon modes in the two directions were measured.

Experimental

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]. The BBO crystal as nonlinear material was pumped by a diode-laser (Blue mode, Toptica) with the emission peak wavelength of 405 nm and a cw power of 30 mW. From the emitted light cone the signal-photons were selected on one side of the cone and fed into the Mach-Zehnder-interferometer. In one arm of the interferometer a beam shifter unit allowed the transversal displacement of the beam in radial and tangential direction. In the second beam splitter cube BS2 the two beams were superimposed after realigning them to the TEM00-mode of the detector. The resulting interference pattern was photographed with the CMOS- or EMCCD camera (see e.g.Fig. [\ref=Fig3]) on one side and with the single photon detector for the visibility measurements on the other. This detector is constructed with a transversal single-mode fiber and an aspherical lens in front of it. Thus photons from a TEM00-mode were measured, only. The beam waist of this mode was aligned to match the TEM00-mode of the pump spot in the BBO crystal by size (165 μm in diameter) and position. Thus, with the beam shifter one of the interfering TEM00-modes selected from the light cone (signal 2 in Fig. [\ref=Fig5]) could be shifted (tilted) radially and tangentially relative to the reference TEM00-mode (signal 1) from the other interferometer arm. Both modes were perfectly overlaid in the second beam splitter. The reference plane at the camera was used for determining the distance between them.

A spectral filter was applied in front of the single mode fiber with a spectral band width of 2.5 nm at a peak wavelength of 808 nm. For decreasing the signal to noise ratio of the visibility measurement the signal photon interference of first-order could also be measured in coincidence with the temporally correlated idler photons on the other side of the cone resulting in visibilities of almost one. But all measurements given here were performed as single photon measurements without any corrections and not in coincidence. For measuring the fringe visibility a delay line (Δl) based on a linear translation stage (Newport) allowed longitudinal delays of 25 mm with an accuracy of 10 nm.

Results

As can be seen from the photo in Fig. [\ref=Fig3] (left) perfect alignment of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer results in an unstructured bright pattern from the overlaid same share of the cone indicating perfect spatial coherence. Aligning both beams in a very small angle in almost horizontal direction results in fringes from the first-order interference of the single signal photons with high contrast as can be seen in the middle trace of Fig. [\ref=Fig3]. If the two interferometer arms are shifted vertically (as in Fig. [\ref=Fig3], right) or horizontally with respect to each other a decrease of the fringe visibility occurs. The fringe distances and directions result from the different angles in the alignments with no effect to the fringe visibility.

All the following quantitative measurements are done with the best possible alignment of the two modes as in Fig. [\ref=Fig3] (left) and the fringe visibility was determined by moving the translation stage for longitudinal delays (Δl in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]). In Fig. [\ref=Fig4] the single photon interference pattern of the signal photons as a function of the translation stage position (longitudinal delay) is shown while overlaying the same spot of the light cone (signal 2 is the same mode as signal 1). It was measured with the single photon detector behind the second beam splitter. In the left graph of this figure the result of a low resolution measurement is given. It allows the determination of the longitudinal coherence length of the measured signal photons to 83 μm, which is in good agreement with the bandwidth of 2.5 nm of the applied spectral interference filter.

In the right graph of Fig. [\ref=Fig4] the result of a high resolution measurement for the same alignment is given. The maximum observed visibility of the not corrected single photon measurements is 90 % in both cases. This visibility measurement is used as a reference for the following sets of experiments where one of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer arms is shifted transversally in tangential and in radial direction. The visibility for each data point was measured in the same way as in Fig. [\ref=Fig4]. The decrease of the visibility is evaluated as a function of the shifts. The results of these measurements are depicted in Fig. [\ref=Fig5].

In Fig. [\ref=Fig5] (left) the result of the visibility evaluation as a function of a tangential shift of one beam (signal 2 in Fig. [\ref=Fig5] and Fig. [\ref=Fig1]) with respect to the fixed one (signal 1). No shift results in maximum visibility of about 90 % as given in Fig. [\ref=Fig5]. But visibility drops rapidly if the mode 2 is shifted more than the radius of the selected Gaussian beam. It has to be pronounced that both interfering beams are well within the light cone structure and thus they both have almost undiminished intensity. This can also be seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig3], right, which is a measurement with less than 40 % visibility, for illustration. The shift of the beam in radial direction results in a similar value as can be seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig5] (right), too. The [formula]-halfwidths of the fitted visibility measurements of Fig. [\ref=Fig5] are ([formula]) mm in tangential and ([formula]) mm in radial direction and the associated maximum visibilities are 0.90 and 0.93.

Theoretical background

The theoretical analysis of the experimental data can be based on a simplified model as in [\cite=Heu14] [\cite=Mil96] using an effective Hamiltonian with couplings aPa†Sa†I and a†PaSaI, where aP,aS, and aI (a†P,a†S, and a†I) are photon anihilation (creation) operators for the pump, signal, and idler fields. This describes the anihilation (creation) of the pump photon and the simultaneous creation (anihilation) of signal and idler photons in the SPDC 3-wave mixing process. We assume perfect phase matching and restrict this analysis to spectral single field modes of frequency ωS and ωI, respectively, which is experimentally realized by the narrow spectral filter. The pump is treated as an undepleted, classical field. From the Heisenberg equations of motion for the field operators we write the photon annihilation part of the total electric field operator for the two relevant signal field modes leaving the crystal as

[formula]

ignoring an irrelevant multiplicative constant. The strong spatial TEM00-mode filtering by the detector in this experiment extracts small spatial shares from these fields, only. Therefore in addition to the usual description as in [\cite=Heu14] [\cite=Mil96] a spatial mode functions for the two measured TEM00 signal field modes propagating in the direction [formula] through the interferometer are included as US1,2 as e.g. described in [\cite=Ling08]. These directions are chosen by the virtual position of the detector behind the two interferometer arms (see Fig. [\ref=Fig1], [\ref=Fig2]) and thus the momentum conservation and phase matching angular restrictions of the down conversion process are considered. The mode function US1,2 for the two TEM00-modes is given by

[formula]

At the second beam splitter BS2 the two fields are superimposed as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]. In the upper arm a phase shift φ and the beam shifter for the TEM00-mode of signal 2 are implemented. Thus behind te second beam splitter BS2 the electric field is given by

[formula]

where [formula] takes care of the tilted and thus in the reference plane shifted TEM00-mode (signal 2 in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]).

Assuming low conversion efficiency, we retain only the lowest-order terms. The signal photon counting rate of the detector is proportional to

[formula]

As result the interference visibility V at the reference plane can be calculated by the normalized cross correlation of the two here in y-direction shifted transversal field distributions of the two modes of signal 1 and signal 2 (see Fig. [\ref=Fig1]).

[formula]

The beam radius w is the field radius given by the detector mode radius wD at the crystal, the propagation distance z from the crystal to the reference plane and the wavelength λ.

[formula]

The optical length from the crystal to the reference plane was 661 mm and thus the coherence radius of the observed mode was 2.06 mm. This radius is identical with the [formula]-halfwidth of the theoretical visibility curve. This is in agreement with the fit of the experimental data of this complex measurement. For the tangential displacements it was 2.22 mm resulting in a relative error of 7%. The theoretical result for the radial displacements shows a relative error of about 25%, which may still support the fundamental idea of this work but in contrast in the radial direction phase matching effects may play a role [\cite=Joob96], which are not considered here.

Conclusion

Although the light cone structure is much wider than the observed mode, the transversal coherence length of the light within the cone is just as large as the single photon mode. This result seems anti-intuitive because especially in tangential direction, along the ring structure, no symmetry breaking feature limits the transversal coherence along the ring. The only limiting factor to explain this experimental result is the selection of the involved modes. By the detector mode a selection of the interacting vacuum field is applied. The interaction of it with the pump mode in the 3-wave mixing process provides the coherent field mode of the observed photons. If photons belong to the tilted mode, which is associated with a tilted vacuum field, in a distinguishable way the visibility drops rapidly. In other words with this experiment the influence of the involved vacuum fields regarding spatial coherence is observed as directly as possible. From this experiment it can be stated that a single photon TEM00 mode is coherent and distinguishable other modes are not coherent to this. In experiments with higher order modes as e.g. TEM01 [\cite=Elsn15] this analogy could be observed indirectly, too. Photons from the same coherent mode are not distinguishable and distinguishable photons belong always to different modes. In other words the vacuum as under laying background for all photon generation processes introduces general randomness in quantum optics but by selecting coherent vacuum fields we see coherent photons allowing interference experiments with visibilities of up to 1. This interplay realizes the complementarity and is the result of the mode selection in the measurement process in quantum optics.
