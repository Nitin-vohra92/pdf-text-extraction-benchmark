Introduction and the main result

Denote by [formula] the n + 1-dimensional Euclidean space endowed with a Cartesian reference system, with the scalar product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 and with the topology it generates.

Denote by Sn the n-dimensional unit sphere in [formula]

A subset of the sphere Sn is said short if it is contained in an open hemisphere.

The subset C  ⊂  Sn is called geodesically convex if together with any two of its points it contains the arc of minimal length of the principal circle on Sn through these points. Sn itself is a geodesically convex set.

A short closed set which is geodesically convex is called a cap.

We use the notation [formula] for the convex hull of A and the notation [formula] for the geodesical convex hull of A  ⊂  Sn (the union of the geodesical lines with endpoints in A). Further [formula] will denote the geodesical distance of points. Besides the standard notion of simplex we also use the notion of the spherical simplex Δ placed in the north hemisphere S+ of Sn such that their vertices are on the equator of Sn. In this case [formula].

Our main result is:

Let Δ be an n + 1-dimensional simplex with vertices in Sn containing the origin in its interior. Then the radial projection from 0 of the closed n-dimensional faces of Δ into Sn furnishes n + 2 caps covering Sn and satisfying (i) and (ii).

A first version for caps of the above theorem is the content of the unpublished note [\cite=nemeth2006].

We mention the formal relation in case of caps with those in the Nerve Theorem ([\cite=hatcher2002] Corollary 4G3). If we consider "open caps" in place of caps, then the conclusion (ii) can be deduced from the mentioned theorem. Moreover, the conclusion holds for a "good" open cover of the sphere too, i. e., an open cover with contractible members and contractible finite intersections. In our theorem the covering with caps has the properties of a "good" covering in this theorem: the members of the covering together with their nonempty intersections are contractible, but their members are closed, circumstance which seems to be rather sophisticated to be surmounted. (Thanks are due to Imre Bárány, who mentioned me this possible connection.)

We shall use in the proofs the following (spherical) variant of Sperner's lemma (considered for simplices by Ky Fan [\cite=FA]):

If a collection of closed sets F1,...,Fn + 1 in Sn covers the spherical simplex engendered by the points a1,...an + 1∈Sn and [formula] then [formula]

Our first goal is to present the proof for caps. (We mention that using the methods in [\cite=KN] and [\cite=KN1] the proof can be carried out in a purely geometric way in contrast with the proof in [\cite=nemeth2006], where we refer to the Sperner lemma.)

Using the variant for caps of the theorem and the Sperner lemma we prove then the variant for short closed sets.

Except the usage of Lemma [\ref=sperner], our methods are elementary: they use repeatedly the induction with respect to the dimension.

The proof of the theorem for caps

1. Consider n + 1 caps C1,...,Cn + 1 on Sn. Ci being a cap, can be separated strictly by a hyperplane

[formula]

from the origin. We can suppose without loss of generality, that the normals ai are linearly independent, since by slightly moving them we can achieve this, without affecting the geometrical picture. If the normals ai are considered oriented toward 0, this strict separation means that αi > 0,  i = 1,...,n. The vectors ai,  i = 1,...,n + 1 engender a reference system in [formula]. Let x be a nonzero element of the positive orthant of this reference system. Then, for t  ≥  0, one has [formula]

Hence, for each t  ≥  0, tx will be a solution of the system

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

with

[formula]

Now, if C1,...,Cn + 1 covers Sn, then so does the union [formula] of halfspaces

[formula]

Since H+i is the complementary set of H-i and [formula], the set [formula] must be inside Sn and hence bounded. But (*) shows that tx with [formula] is in this set for any t  ≥  0. The obtained contradiction shows that the family C1,...,Cn + 1 cannot cover Sn.

The proof of this item is also consequence of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem [\cite=LS] which asserts that if Sn is covered by the closed sets F1,...,Fk with [formula] then k  ≥  n + 2.

2. Let C1,...,Cn + 2 be caps covering Sn.

(i) Then they cannot have a common point x, since this case - x cannot be covered by any Ci. (No cap can contain diametrically opposite points of Sn.)

Hence, condition (i) must hold.

(ii) To prove that [formula] we proceed by induction.

For S1, the circle, Ci is an arc (containing its endpoints) of length <  π, i = 1,2,3. The arcs C1,C2,C3 cover S1. Hence, they cannot have common points, and the endpoint of each arc must be contained in exactly one of the other two arcs. Hence, Ci meets Cj for every [formula] If [formula], then c1,  c2,  c3 are tree pairwise different points on the circle, hence they are in general position and 0 is an interior point of the triangle they span.

Suppose the assertions (ii) and (iii) hold for n - 1 and let us prove them for n.

Take Cn + 2 and let H be a hyperplane through 0 which does not meet Cn + 2. Then, H determines the closed hemispheres S- and S+. Suppose that Cn + 2 is placed inside S- (in the interior of S- with respect the topology of Sn). Hence, C1,...,Cn + 1 must cover S+ and denoting by Sn - 1 the n - 1-dimensional sphere [formula], these sets cover Sn - 1. Now, [formula] are caps in Sn - 1 which cover this sphere. Thus, the induction hypothesis works for these sets.

Take the points [formula]. Then, d1,...,dn + 1 will be in general position and 0 is an interior point of the simplex they span. By their definition, it follows that [formula] and hence d1,...,dj - 1,dj + 1,...,dn + 1∈Dj,  j = 1,2,...n + 1.

Consider the closed hemisphere S+ to be endowed with a spherical simplex structure Δ whose vertices are the points d1,...,dn + 1 .

Since C1,...,Cn + 1 cover S+, and [formula], Lemma [\ref=sperner] can be applied to the spherical simplex Δ, yielding

[formula]

This shows that each collection of n + 1 sets Cj have nonempty intersection and proves (ii) for n.

(If we prefer a purely geometric proof of this item, we can refer to the spherical analogue of the results in [\cite=KN1].)

From the geometric picture is obvious that two caps meet if and only if their convex hulls meet. Hence, from the conditions (i) and (ii) for the caps Ci, it follows that these conditions hold also for [formula]

Take

[formula]

Let us show that for an arbitrary k∈N,

[formula]

Assume the contrary. Denote

[formula]

Thus, dim H  ≤  n. The points ai are all in the manifold H. Denote

[formula]

Since [formula] and ai∈H, it follows that

[formula]

This means that the family of convex compact sets {Bj:  j = 1,...,n + 2} in H possesses the property that every n + 1 of its elements have nonempty intersection. Then, by Helly's theorem, they have a common point. But this would be a point of [formula] too, which contradicts (ii) for the sets Ai.

Hence, every n + 2 points [formula] are in general position. Since c1,...,ci - 1,ci + 1,...,cn + 2∈Ci, it follows that the open halfspace determined by the hyperplane they engender containing 0 contains also the point ci.

This proves (iii).

Suppose that the caps C1,...,Cn + 2 posses the properties in (i) and (ii). Then, the method in the above proof yields that the points

[formula]

engender an n + 1-simplex with 0 in its interior and

[formula]

The radial projections of the n-faces of this simplex into Sn obviously cover Sn. The union of these projections are contained in [formula].

This completes the proof for cups.

The proof of the theorem for short closed sets

We carry out the proof by induction.

Consider n = 1 and suppose F1,F2,F3 are short closed sets covering S1.

If [formula], then by the above hypothesis [formula], which is impossible. Hence,

[formula]

must hold.

Denote [formula], then [formula] is a connected arc of S1 covered by F1,F2. One must have [formula], since if for instance [formula] then it would follow that the closed sets F1 and C3, both of geodesical diameter <  π cover S1, which is impossible. Since C is connected and [formula] are closed sets in C covering this set, [formula] must hold.

The geodesically convex sets [formula] cover S1, hence applying the theorem for caps to [formula], we conclude that these points are in general position and the simplex engendered by them must contain 0 as an interior point.

Suppose that the assertions hold for n - 1 and prove them for n.

Suppose that

[formula]

The assertion (i) is a consequence of the theorem for caps applied to [formula] (or a consequence of the Lusternik Schnirelmann theorem).

Suppose that Fn + 2 is contained in the interior (with respect to the topology of Sn) of the south hemisphere S- and denote by Sn - 1 the equator of Sn.

Now [formula] with [formula] and we can apply the induction hypothesis for Sn - 1 and the closed sets F'i,  i = 1,...,n + 1. Since [formula] cover Sn - 1, and they are caps, the theorem for caps applies and hence the points are in general position.

The closed sets cover S+, the north hemisphere considered as a spherical simplex Δ engendered by a1,...,an + 1 [formula]). (Here [formula] is the interior of S+ in the space Sn.) Further,

[formula]

Hence, we can apply Lemma [\ref=sperner] to conclude that there exists a point a in [formula]

Since

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

because [formula] by the induction hypothesis and the theorem for caps. Thus,

[formula]

and we have condition (ii) fulfilled for n.

The condition (iii) follows from the theorem for caps applied to

[formula]

If S1 is covered by the closed sets F1,F2,F3 with the property [formula], then [formula] [formula]

Indeed, assume that [formula]. Then [formula] If ai∈Fi are the points in Fi,  i = 1,2 with [formula] then the closed arc C  ⊂  S1 with the endpoints a1,  a2 must be contained in F3, and hence [formula], and then - C must be covered by [formula]. Since - a1∈ - C cannot be in F1, it must be in F2, and - a2∈F1. Thus, [formula] and [formula] while the last two sets cover - C. Since - C is connected and the respective sets are closed, they must have a common point, contradicting the hypothesis [formula].

This way, we obtain (ii) fulfilled for n = 1 for this more general case. We claim that the conditions also hold for n, that is, if the closed sets F1,...,Fn + 2 with [formula] cover Sn, then condition (ii) holds. (Condition (i) is a consequence of the definition of the sets Fi.)
