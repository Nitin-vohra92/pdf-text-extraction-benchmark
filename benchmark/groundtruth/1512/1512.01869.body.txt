Origin of Both the Fast Hot Jet and the Slow Cool Jet from Magnetic Flux Emergence and Advection in the Solar Transition Region

Introduction

Solar jets are the typical transient ejecta at various spatia-temporal scales that are significant to understand energy and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Based on the spatial sizes, life-times, morphology, and physical properties, the jets are classified in the various forms, e.g., spicules [\citep=Beckers1968], chromospheric anemone jets [\citep=Shibata2007], penumbral jets [\citep=Katsukawa2007], extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets [\citep=Innes1997], and X-ray jets [\citep=Shibata1992], to name only a few. Using high-resolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) [\citep=Pontieu2014], [\cite=Tian2014] report the prevalence of intermittent small-scale jets with speeds of 80 to 250 km s- 1 from narrow bright network lanes of the solar transition region. These jets have lifetimes of 20 to 80 seconds, and recur at roughly the same locations on time scales of ~   2 to 15 minutes. They have the width of 300 km, and reach temperatures of at least ~  105 K as well as the height beyond ~   15 Mm. As these jets originate from localized bright regions, and appear to reveal the characteristic inverted Y-shape morphology, magnetic reconnection between the small magnetic loops and the background open flux is suggested to be mechanism that initiates and drives these events.

Although classical spicules were discovered many years ago, they still remain one of mysterious phenomena in the solar atmosphere. Classical spicules are usually seen as thin and elongated structures in the solar limb, and are formed at temperatures of ~  104 K and at an altitude of about 2000 km [\citep=Sterling2000]. With a speed of dozens of km s- 1, they reach at a maximum altitude and then either disappear or fall of to the photosphere. So, they form up-down parabolic paths. To explain the observed properties of classical spicules, various mechanisms have been suggested. Thses include shocks-driver produced by the steepening of pulses [\citep=Hollweg1982], Alfvén waves [\citep=Haerendel1992], and p-mode leakage [\citep=Pontieu2004]; magnetic forces from reconnection or emergence [\citep=Uchida1969] [\citep=Mart2009]; or the generation of a low pressure region above the chromosphere [\citep=Hammer2003]. However, none of them provides convincing explanations of all the observed properties of classical spicules.

Numerical simulations have been employed before to understand the formation of solar jets. [\cite=Suematsu1982] presented a one-dimensional (1D) spicule simulation in which ejection occurs as a result of sudden thermal pressure enhancement at the root of the spicule. [\cite=Yokoyama1995] conducted two-dimensional (2D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the reconnection between emerging flux and uniform coronal fields, and showed that X-ray jets and Hα surges can be ejected simultaneously from microflares. With a more realistic temperature and density distribution in the corona, [\cite=Nishizuka2008] extended this model to simulate a giant jet with both cool and hot components as discovered by Hinode. In their models, the hot jets are accelerated by the magnetic tension force of the reconnected field lines, while cool jets are accelerated by the slingshot effect due to the reconnection. In realistic three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the outer solar atmosphere, [\cite=Mart2011] report on features that resemble the newly observed spicules. These features are driven by a strong Lorentz force that squeezes the chromospheric material, resulting in a vertical pressure gradient as well as Joule heating, which propels and heats the jet material, forcing it to fade when observed in chromospheric lines. To explain the chromospheric anemone jets related to the moving magnetic features (MMFs), [\cite=Yang2013b] performed a numerical experiment of low chromospheric magnetic reconnection driven by the horizontal motion in the photosphere, and found that not only chromospheric jets but also slow-mode shocks are ejected. However, as of yet, no simulations can explain the high-speed transitional region jets found by [\cite=Tian2014] only recently.

Here, we will present a 2D numerical simulation with the aim to investigate the formation of the high-speed jets seen by [\cite=Tian2014], with the jets being induced by magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the background open flux. To realize this, we drive the loop by the supergranular convection motion. From the simulation results, we show that not only the fast transition region jet but also a slow cool jet like classical spicules is launched. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a general description of the numerical MHD model is given. Section 3 describes the results of the numerical simulation and their analysis. Section 4 is reserved for the summary and discussion.

Numerical MHD Model

The details of the numerical MHD model used here have been described in [\cite=Feng2014]. In brief, the model solves the mass, momentum, energy, and induction equation as [\cite=Yang2013a] in spherical coordinate, with the equations split into a fluid part and a magnetic part [\citep=Ziegler2011]. A Godunov-type finite volume method with magnetic forces as source terms is used for the fluid part and a constrained-transport method able to maintain the divergence-free constraint is used for the magnetic induction part. We adopt a second-order accurate linear ansatz reconstruction with a minmod limiter as well as the Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solvers for both the fluid part and magnetic induction part. In time integration, the explicit second-order Runge-Kutta stepping with total variation diminishing is applied.

As the axisymmetrical symmetry is assumed in this work, the computational region extends from 1 to 30 Mm in the radial (r - )direction, and from π / 2 - 14 Mm/Rs (Rs = 696 Mm is solar radius) to π / 2 in the latitudinal (θ  -  )direction. The top of the chromosphere is at r  =  0 Mm. The center of the magnetic funnel is set at θ  =  π / 2, so that the simulation region is also symmetric around θ  =  π / 2. The domain is covered by a uniform grid space in the θ  -   direction with δθ  =  0.1 Mm/Rs, and a nonuniform grid space in the r - direction with δr  =  25 km for 0 Mm ≤  r  ≤   4 Mm, δr  =  50 km for 4 Mm   ≤  r  ≤  6 Mm, as well as δr  =  100 km for r  ≥   6 Mm.

We employed the same initial distributions of the plasma density ρ, pressure p, and velocity [formula] as [\cite=Yang2013a], and only potential open funnel structure [\citep=Hackenberg2000] for initial magnetic field input. Boundary conditions are as follows. Along θ  =  π / 2, the symmetric condition is used. The open boundary conduction is applied along θ  =  π / 2  -  14 Mm/Rs and also at the top boundary r  =  30 Mm. At the low boundary of r = 1 Mm, to describe the supergranular motion, a magnetic loop is first brought into the computational domain by the upward flow, and then advected by the horizontal flow. In the first stage, which continues about 2.5 minutes, an equilibrium axisymmetrical magnetic loop as the form given by [\cite=wu1995] is moved slowly upwards by simply changing the values of density, velocity, pressure, and magnetic field at the low boundary. After the magnetic loop settles in place, we set up the horizontal flow as [\cite=Yang2013a].

Results

Figure [\ref=figure1] and Animation 1 show that in response to the supergranular convection motion, both a fast hot jet bounded by the two purple field lines at the second column of Figure [\ref=figure1] and a slow cool jet roughly bounded by the two light-green field lines at the second column of Figure [\ref=figure1] forms. At t = 1.3 minutes, the magnetic loop has come into the domain, and becomes hot as a result of the implemented heating there. It compresses the pre-existing ambient open fields, and the reconnection between them takes place. As a result, the fast hot jet is launched from the transition region. At the same time, the slow cool jet next to the fast hot jet has shotted up to ~   5 Mm. Nevertheless, at the left unperturbed region, the funnel including radiative losses, heat conduction, and heating, is relaxed into a quasi-steady state that extends from a cool dense chromosphere to a hot tenuous corona with a transition region at a height of about 1.5 Mm. At t = 4.6 minutes, the emerging loop moves to the left and becomes smaller as a result of further reconnection. The fast hot jet has come to the height beyond ~   20 Mm, and the slow cool jet with negative velocity falls down. At t = 7.0 minutes, the emerging loop goes further to the left, and nearly exhausts. So, the reconnection becomes weak. The fast hot jet has gone, with the velocity being nearly negative at the high altitude. Meantime, the slow cool jet completely falls of to the lower atmosphere.

To visualize the appearance of both the fast hot jet and the slow cool jet, we synthesize the pseudo emissions (Pse Ems), which are computed as:

[formula]

For the fast hot jet, we choose T0 to be [formula] K, and Δ log T0 to be 0.2; for the slow cool jet, they are 104 K and 0.3, respectively. The calculated Pse Ems are shown in Figure [\ref=figure2] and Animation 2, which clearly display the features of both jets. At t = 1.3 minutes, the pseudo emission at 104 K is strong, so that the slow cool jet clearly appears. However, as the hot plasma in the loop has not squeezed into the reconnection region, the hot jet has not been really driven. Therefore, the pseudo emission at [formula] K has nearly no information of the fast hot jet. At t = 4.6 minutes, the pseudo emission at 104 K shows the degrading slow cool jet, while the pseudo emission at [formula] K displays unambiguously the fast hot jet going up to ~   20 Mm. At t = 7.0 minutes, the slow cool jet disappears totally for pseudo emission at 104 K, and the signals of the fast hot jet becomes weak for the pseudo emission at [formula] K.

Fast Hot Jet

To see the fast hot jet in detail, Figure [\ref=figure3] displays the calculated time-distance diagrams of the density N, temperature T, and vertical velocity Vz along the same flux tube in the fast hot jet, which shows that after t = ~   2.0 minutes, when the emerging loop has been heated up (Animation 1), the fast hot jet starts to be ejected. At t = ~   3.0 minutes, the strength of it comes to a peak, with the density of ~  2.0  ×  109 cm- 3, the temperature of ~  6.0  ×  105 K, and the speed of ~   130 km s- 1. This peak continues ~   1.0 minutes, after which, that is at t = ~   4.0 minutes, the density of the driven fast hot jet becomes to be [formula] cm- 3, and the velocity decreases to be ~   60 km s- 1. At t = ~   6.0 minutes, the velocity of the driven fast hot jet becomes downward. The jet starts to fall down. Combined with Animation 1 and 2, it can be seen that the maximal height the driven fast hot jet reaches is beyond ~   15 Mm, the widths are around ~   400 km, and the lifetime is about 5 minutes, with the substructures of very high velocity lasting 30 s. It can also be seen that at the top boundary, the jet leaves there at the lower density and velocity (the velocity is still ~   60 km s- 1).

To see how the fast hot jet (also the slow cool jet) is driven, we conducted force analysis, which is presented in Figure [\ref=figure3]. This figure shows that around the reconnection region, the Lorentz force is dominant over the gas pressure force. In the inflow region, the vertical Lorentz force (FL)z pushes the plasma, together with the frozen-in reconnected field lines, into the resistivity region. However, in the outflow region, the large values of (FL)z ejects the hot plasma, along with the frozen-in magnetic field, away from the resistivity region, to form both upward and downward outflow. When the outflow goes upward to develop into the jet, it undergoes no further acceleration either by the vertical Lorentz force (FL)z or by the vertical gas pressure force (FP)z. So, it is evident that the Lorentz force associated with the magnetic reconnection continually drives the fast hot jet.

It should be mentioned that when we decrease the emerging magnetic strength, e.g. third times smaller than the case presented here, the features of the driven fast hot jet (also the slow cool jet) changes. In that case, the emerging loop is small, and the reconnection is relatively weak. As a result, the temperature and maximal speed of the produced hot jet only reach ~  2  ×  105 K and ~   80 km s- 1, respectively. The maximal height is around ~   5 Mm, and the lifetime is about 2.5 minutes, much smaller that those of the fast hot jet shown here.

Slow Cool Jet

Figure [\ref=figure4] displays the calculated time-distance diagrams of the density N, temperature T, and vertical velocity Vz along the same flux tube but in the slow cool jet. It can be clearly seen that the slow cool jet works on an up-down parabolic path as classical spicules. At t = 2.0 minutes, the slow cool jet arrives at ~   7 Mm, with a speed of ~  50 km s- 1. At t = 4.0 minutes, it comes to the maximum height of ~   11 Mm. At t = 6.0 minutes, the slow cool jet falls to ~   5 Mm, with a speed of ~   - 80 km s- 1, and at t = 7.0 minutes, it completely fall of to the chromosphere. So, the lifetime of this slow cool jet is ~   7.0 minutes, consistent with the typical lifetime of classical spicules. Also, its density, temperature, and velocity approach to those of classical spicules. However, unlike classical spicules, there is a low density behind the high density, which does not arises in the pseudo emission at 104 K shown in Figure [\ref=figure2] and Animation 2. So, the appearance of the slow cool jet in pseudo emission at 104 K is more resemble a classical spicule.

The force analysis in figure [\ref=figure3] shows that as a result of the sudden decrease of magnetic flux at the top of the emerging loop, there is a large but positive vertical Lorentz force (FL)z. This force gives a initial kick to the cool plasma, so driving the cool plasma upwards to form the slow cool jet. Afterwards, the equilibrium between the vertical Lorentz force and the vertical gas pressure force (FP)z makes the slow cool jet follow a ballistic trajectory. To check whether the slow cool jet is driven by the initial kick of Lorentz force or not, we simply calculate the height the slow cool jet could go by

[formula]

where f,Δt,g and h are force, the duration of time by force, solar gravity, and height, respectively. By taking f  =  10- 6 km m- 2 s- 2, Δt  =  10 s, and ρ  =  10- 10 kg m- 3, we could get h  =  20 Mm, consistent with the height that the slow cool jet arrives at.

As the fast hot jet, when the emerging magnetic strength decreases to the three times smaller than the case presented here, the features of the driven slow cool jet changes, with its velocity decreasing to be 20 km s- 1, the maximal height being 4 Mm, and the lifetime being about 2 minutes.

Conclusion

In this letter we conducted a 2D numerical simulation to investigate the magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the background open flux in the transition region. The reconnection is induced by the supergranular convection motion. The simulation results show that not only the fast transition region jet but also a slow cool jet similar in many respects to a spicule is ejected. The cool jet is ejected first, and later the hot and cool jets coexist. Finally, the cool jet falls down, while the hot jet continues upwards and fades away after the driver stops.

By analysis of the force, we found that the hot jet is continually driven by the Lorentz force around the reconnection region, while the cool jet is ejected by an initial kick through the Lorentz force associated with the emerging magnetic flux. Also, the features of the driven jets change with the amount of the emerging magnetic flux, which gives a variety of both jets.

The fast hot jet produced here, with the speed of ~  130 km s- 1, the width of ~   400 km, and the total lifetime of about 5 minutes (the substructures lasting 30 s), matches with those of the transition region jets found by [\cite=Tian2014]. However, its temperature and maximal height go beyond those of the observed transition region jets, although [\cite=Tian2014] do not exclude that the jet is hotter and the height it could go is higher. Future models with different initial heating in the closed loop might give lower temperature and height as expected for [\cite=Tian2014].

In this work, we showed that magnetic reconnection between the small magnetic loops and the background open flux provides a good mechanism to drive high-speed transition region jets. However, there might be other mechanisms at work, for example, the velocity pulses at the transition region [\citep=Murawski2011], the squeezing of magnetic flux tubes with identical polarities [\citep=He2010], ect. Future work will have to show what the role of these processes is to accelerate the transition region jets.

These prevalent high-speed jets may be an intermittent but continual source of mass and energy for the solar wind as argued by [\cite=Tian2014]. To test this hypothesis, the mechanism for the jets we presented here could be included into solar wind model [\citep=Yang2013a]. This will show the role of jets on the nascent solar wind. In particular, such models could highlight the interaction with the steady wind originating from the networks, where the high-speed jets play an important role, too [\citep=Tian2014]. Hopefully, new observational diagnostics of the transition regions made with high spatial and temporal resolution by the IRIS will help to further constrain and develop the model proposed here.
