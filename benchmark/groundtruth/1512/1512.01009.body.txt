A Bollobás-type theorem for affine subspaces

Introduction

First we introduce some notation.

In the following let q = rα be a fixed prime power, n  ≥  1 be a nonnegative integer. Let W denote the n-dimensional affine space over the finite field [formula].

B. Bollobás proved in [\cite=B] the following famous result.

Let [formula] and [formula] be two families of sets such that [formula] if and only if i = j. Then

[formula]

In particular if |Ai| = r and |Bi| = s for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, then

[formula]

The following strengthening of the uniform version of Bollobás's theorem was proved by L. Lovász in [\cite=L1] using tensor product methods.

If [formula] is an r-uniform family and [formula] is an s-uniform family such that

[formula]

for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and

[formula]

if i < j (1  ≤  i,j  ≤  m), then

[formula]

L. Lovász also proved the following generalization of Bollobás' theorem for subspaces of a vector space in [\cite=L2]:

Let [formula] be an arbitrary field and V be an n-dimensional vector space over the field [formula].

Let [formula] denote r-dimensional subspaces of V and [formula] denote s-dimensional subspaces of the vector space V. Assume that

[formula]

for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and

[formula]

whenever i < j (1  ≤  i,j  ≤  m). Then

[formula]

In the following we give an affine version of Theorem [\ref=subspace].

We say that a pair of families of affine subspaces (Ai,Bi)1  ≤  i  ≤  m of W is cross-intersecting if

[formula]

for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and

[formula]

whenever i < j,  (1  ≤  i,j  ≤  m).

Let m(n,q) denote the maximal size of a cross-intersecting pair of families of affine subspaces (Ai,Bi)1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Our main result is the following modification of Lovász' Theorem [\ref=subspace]:

Let [formula] and [formula] be affine subspaces of an n-dimensional affine space W over the finite field [formula], where q  ≠  2. Assume that (Ai,Bi)1  ≤  i  ≤  m is cross-intersecting. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=main] means that

[formula]

Our result is a strengthening of Theorem [\ref=Lovasz] in the case of affine hyperplanes.

In Section 2 we prove Theorem [\ref=main]. In the proof we use the polynomial subspace method (see [\cite=BF]).

In Section 3 we give a simple construction, which shows that [formula].

Finally in Section 4 we collect some open problems.

The proof of the main result

We use the following obvious observation in our proof.

The intersection of a family of affine subspaces is either empty or equal to a translate of the intersection of their corresponding vector subspaces.

Recall that our main result was the following:

Let [formula] and [formula] be affine subspaces of an n-dimensional affine space W over the finite field [formula], where q  ≠  2. Assume that (Ai,Bi)1  ≤  i  ≤  m is cross-intersecting. Then

[formula]

Proof:

Let p be an arbitrary, but fixed prime divisor of q - 1. Since q  ≠  2, hence p > 1. We can assign for each subset [formula] its characteristic vector [formula] such that (s) = 1 iff s∈F. Here (s) denotes the sth coordinate of the vector [formula].

Let 1  ≤  j  ≤  m be fixed. Let [formula] denote the characteristic vector of the affine subspace Aj and let [formula] denote the characteristic vector of the affine subspace Bj. Here (i) denotes the ith coordinate of the vector [formula]. Similarly, (i) denotes the ith coordinate of the vector [formula].

Consider the polynomials

[formula]

for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

We claim that the polynomials {Pi: ~ 1  ≤  i  ≤  m} are linearly independent functions over [formula]. Namely

[formula]

and

[formula]

where t  ≥  0, because (Ai,Bi)1  ≤  i  ≤  m is a cross-intersecting pair of families of affine subspaces and hence we can apply Proposition [\ref=meet]. Since

[formula]

thus

[formula]

Consider a linear combination

[formula]

where [formula]. It is easy to prove that λr = 0 for each 1≤  r  ≤  m. Namely for contradiction, suppose that there exists a nontrivial linear relation

[formula]

Let s0 be the smallest s such that λs  ≠  0. Substitute [formula] for the variable of each side of (). Then by equations ([\ref=eq3]) and ([\ref=eq2]), all but the sth0 term vanish, and what remains is

[formula]

But Ps0()  ≠  0 implies that λs0 = 0, a contradiction. Hence the polynomials [formula] are linearly independent functions over [formula].

We infer that the linearly independent polynomials [formula] are in the [formula]-space spanned by the monomials

[formula]

Clearly

[formula]

hence

[formula]

which was to be proved. to5pt to8pt to6pt width6pt

A simple construction

We use in our contruction the following simple proposition.

Let Fj be arbitrary affine subspaces for each 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. Let Gj: =  + Fj, where ∉Fj. Then [formula] iff ∈Fi - Fj.

First suppose that ∈Fi - Fj. Then we can write [formula] into the form

[formula]

where ∈Fi and ∈Fj. Hence   =    +  ∈ + Fj = Gj.

On the other hand, suppose that [formula]. Let [formula], i.e., ∈Fi and ∈ + Fj. Then there exists ∈Fj such that   =    +  by definition. Hence   =    -  ∈Fi - Fj. to5pt to8pt to6pt width6pt

Let n  ≥  1 and q be an arbitrary prime power. Then [formula].

Let [formula]. We give a concrete cross-intersecting pair of families of affine subspaces [formula] and [formula] of an n-dimensional affine space W over the finite field [formula]. Let

[formula]

denote an enumeration of the set of hyperplanes of the vector space [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula]. For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m we fix a vector [formula]. Define

[formula]

and

[formula]

Clearly Ai,Bi are affine subspaces of W for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

Since ∉Hi for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, hence [formula] by the definition of Ai and Bi.

On the other hand, since [formula], hence it follows from Proposition [\ref=eltolt] that [formula] for each 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  m. to5pt to8pt to6pt width6pt

Open problems

Here we collect some interesting open problems.

Open problem 1: What can we say about m(n,2)?

Open problem 2: What is the precise value of m(n,q), if q > 2?

Finally we conjecture the following projective version of Theorem [\ref=main]:

Let [formula] be an arbitrary field. Let [formula] and [formula] be projective subspaces of an n-dimensional projective space W over the field [formula]. Assume that (Ai,Bi)1  ≤  i  ≤  m is cross-intersecting (i.e. [formula] for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and [formula] whenever 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  m). Then
