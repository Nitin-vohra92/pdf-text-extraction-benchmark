Dark Matter in Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right Theories

Introduction

Some of the unsolved puzzles of the universe like tiny neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, dark matter and dark energy, coupling unification of three fundamental interactions have brought in the realization that, the Standard Model of particle physics is unlikely to be the final theory and needs to be extended beyond its boundaries. The beyond SM framework with a much larger territory offers numerous possibilities of new physics which need to be explored with their experimental verifications.

Among all the possibilities, the left-right symmetric models based on the gauge group SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B - L  ×  SU(3)C [\cite=Mohapatra:1974gc] [\cite=Pati:1974yy] [\cite=Senjanovic:1975rk] [\cite=Senjanovic:1978ev] [\cite=Mohapatra:1979ia] [\cite=Mohapatra:1980yp] [\cite=Pati:1973uk] [\cite=Pati:1974vw] seems quite promising and is picked up often for explaining the origin of neutrino masses and parity violation at electroweak scale. The underlying mechanisms for originating light neutrino masses in these manifest LRSMs are the type-I plus type-II [\cite=Mohapatra:1979ia] [\cite=Mohapatra:1980yp] [\cite=Deshpande:1990ip] seesaw mechanisms where the parity and SU(2)R gauge symmetry are spontaneously broken at the same scale. Apart from this, when left-right symmetry breaks at few TeV, it delivers rich Collider phenomenology including the recent diboson excess reported by ATLAS and some low energy processes like neutrinoless double beta decay which will confirm lepton number violation in nature if experimentally observed. A pretty good number of attempts have been made to address the issue of Dark matter in these manifest left-right symmetric models as well [\cite=Heeck:2015qra] [\cite=Garcia-Cely:2015quu] .

However, a different class of left-right symmetric model is considered here in which the leptons and baryons are defined as local gauge symmetries. This class of left-right symmetric model is termed "Lepto-Baryonic left-right symmetric model (LB-LRSM)" and is based on the gauge group SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B  ×  U(1)L  ×  SU(3)C [\cite=He:1989mi] [\cite=Duerr:2013opa] [\cite=Patra:2015vmp] . The rank of this LB-LRSM being six, it can not be embedded in a known GUT model like SU(5) or SO(10) GUT. Any theory which can be embedded in GUT theory is constrained by the proton decay constraints to have the cut-off scale >  1015.6 GeV . Interestingly this limit is not applicable to LB-LRSM and thus, the unification scale can be lower significantly which might lead to striking signatures.

In minimal left-right symmetric models the relic density and indirect detection including Sommerfeld enhancement push up the dark mass beyond few TeV making it unsuitable for LHC probe. But good enough from collider prospective, in LB-LRSM the singlet fermion dark matter lie at low scale which is studied in a recent work [\cite=Patra:2015vmp]. However, this paper intends to focus on LB-LRSM and scrutinize all dark matter candidates which can be accommodated in it successfully. The plan of the paper goes as follows. In Sec-II, the LB-LRSM with one and two stage breaking to SM gauge theory is studied. In Sec-III, all viable dark matter candidates that can arise naturally in LB-LRSM are discussed. The result is summed up towards the end and the interactions for LB-LRSM are provided in the appendix.

Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right Models

The Lepto-Baryonic left-right symmetric models (LB-LRSM) are based on the basic gauge group [\cite=He:1989mi] [\cite=Duerr:2013opa] [\cite=Patra:2015vmp]

[formula]

omitting the SU(3)C structure for simplicity and leptons, baryons are defined as local gauge symmetries of the theory. The electric charge is defined as

[formula]

Under the LB-LRSM gauge group, the usual quarks and leptons transform as

[formula]

It is found that these leptonic and baryonic currents are quantum mechanically anomalous. To have a consistent anomaly free left-right symmetric theory one needs to introduce additional fermion degree of freedom having non-zero lepton and baryon charge. There are many ways one can construct anomaly free theory of LB-LRSM which has been pointed out in appendix. A simple extension by additional fermion triplets [formula] is considered to serve the purpose,

[formula]

The motivation behind introducing fermion triplets is two fold:

it cancels non-trivial gauge anomaly making the Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right symmetric models anomaly free theories.

the neutral component of these fermion triplets can be viable stable cold dark matter where the stability is ensured automatically.

The spontaneous symmetry breaking of LB-LRSM can be done in different ways leading to interesting phenomenology. However, in this work only two stage and single stage breaking of LB-LRSM to SM gauge group is discussed as below.

Two stage symmetry breaking

The phenomenologically interesting two stage breaking of LB-LRSM can be understood in following ways:

At first, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of U(1)B  ×  U(1)L to U(1)B - L is done via scalar SBL(1,1,3 / 2,3 / 2) singlet under SU(2)L,R. The inclusion of the scalar not only does the job of spontaneous symmetry breaking but also gives masses to extra fermion triplets though

[formula]

The second stage of symmetry breaking is done as in usual LR symmetric model where the breaking of SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B - L to U(1)Y is achieved by scalar triplets ΔL(3,1, - 2)+ΔR(1,3, - 2). However, this stage of symmetry breaking can be implemented via scalar doublets HL(2,1, - 1)+HR(1,2, - 1).

The symmetry breaking pattern for two stage breaking of LB-LRSM is given below

The advantage of two stage symmetry breaking is that one can make an analogy with the minimal left-right symmetric model and its low scale phenomenology. The LB-LRSM with scalar triplets, scalar bidoublet along with scalar singlet,

[formula]

the neutrino mass is given by type-I plus type-II seesaw mechanism,

[formula]

where the Majorana mass matrix for left-handed (right-handed) neutrinos is ML  =  fL〈ΔL〉  =  fvL (MR  =  fR〈ΔR〉  =  fvR while the Dirac neutrino mass matrix connecting light-heavy neutrinos is mD  =  yv1  +  v2. This results in mass formula for light as well as heavy neutrinos as

[formula]

The consequences of LRSM seesaw mechanism to neutrinoless double beta decay, LFV and collider studies have been explored recently. This will be applicable to LB-LRSM if the symmetry breaking happens at few TeV scale with additional signature which might discriminate between minimal LRSM and LB-LRSM in future.

One stage symmetry breaking

The one stage symmetry breaking of LB-LRSM has been discussed in [\cite=Duerr:2013opa] in the context of neutrino mass via type-III seesaw. In this scenario, the spontaneous symmetry breaking SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B  ×  U(1)L to SM gauge group SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y via scalars HL(2,13 / 4, - 1 / 4), HR(1,2,3 / 4, - 1 / 4) and SBL(1,1,3 / 2,3 / 2). Later SM gauge group breaks down to low energy theory by standard Higgs contained in LR bidoublet as Φ(2,2,0,0). The anomaly free gauge LB-LR theories one stage breaking is compromised with fermions qL(2,1,1 / 3,0), qR(1,2,1 / 3,0), [formula], [formula] and additional fermion triplets ΣL(3,1,3 / 4,3 / 4), ΣR(1,3,3 / 4,3 / 4) while scalar sector consists of Φ(2,2,0,0), HR(1,2,3 / 4, - 1 / 4), HL(2,1,3 / 4, - 1 / 4) and SBL(1,1,3 / 2,3 / 2). This can be easily understood by the following manner If there will be no restriction on B and L charge of Higgs doublets from neutrino mass via type-III seesaw mechanism, then any B and L charge can be assigned for Higgs doublets mediating LB-LRSM symmetry breaking. Then the neutral component of fermion triplet can be stable dark matter where stability is ensured automatically. Since Higgs doublets do not couple to leptons, there is no Majorana mass term for left-handed as well as right-handed neutrino and thus, type-I plus type-II seesaw terms are absent. Then, the mechanism of light neutrino masses can be understood via extended seesaw mechanism by adding complete LB-LR singlet fermions.

Stable Dark Matter Candidates

The prime aim here is to present viable dark matter candidates within Lepto-Baryonic left-right symmetric theories.

Fermion triplet Dark Matter

From previous discussions, it is very much clear that we need fermion triplets [formula], as a simple example, to make the LB-LRSM anomaly free gauge theory. The key point to note here is that the neutral component of fermion triplets needed for anomaly cancellation can be a stable dark matter candidate where stability of the dark matter is ensured automatically. The relevant interaction Lagrangian for fermion triplet dark matter within LB-LRSM is given by

[formula]

[formula]

The radiative corrections gives mass splitting between neutral and charged components of fermion triplets. For left-handed fermion triplets, the mass splitting is 166 MeV whereas the mass splitting among right-handed triplet will depend upon mass of the heavy gauge bosons WR,ZR involved in loop. The dark matter phenomenology for triplets will differ from refs.[\cite=Heeck:2015qra] [\cite=Garcia-Cely:2015quu] due to additional co annihilation effects from [formula] gauge boson mediated diagrams. Thus, in LB-LRSM, the possible annihilation channels are

The scalar portal annihilation channels are

[formula]

Here we denote Hi and H∓    ∓ are the heavy scalars, [formula] are extra neutral gauge bosons. We can ignore most of these channels by assuming the small mixing between the singlet scalar SBL and other Higgs scalars.

The [formula] portal annihilation channels are

[formula]

There are important t-channel processes contributing to relic density calculation are

[formula]

Following dark matter phenomenology discussed in refs.[\cite=Heeck:2015qra] [\cite=Garcia-Cely:2015quu] and standard calculation for Majorana dark matter via [formula]-portal, one can explain PLANCK-WMAP[\cite=Ade:2015xua] with few TeV dark matter masses.

Fermion Doublet Dark Matter

A few solutions for gauge anomaly cancellation within Lepto-Baryonic LR theories are presented in the appendix. One of these solutions is lepto-baryons having doublet under SU(2)L,R with lepton and baryon number as - 3. This immediately results B - L = 0 and the electric charge relation

[formula]

implies the neutral component has non-zero Hyper charge. Thus, the fermionic doublet dark matter can couple to SM Z and thereby, ruled out from direct detection constraints. Alternatively, one can introduce another singlet fermion dark matter such that the two component helps in evading direct detection constraints.

Fermion Singlet Dirac Dark Matter

Very recently, it is pointed out in ref.[\cite=Patra:2015vmp] that a vector-like fermionic Dirac dark matter can be easily accommodated within LB-LRSM. The relevant interactions for this singlet fermion Dirac dark matter [formula] with [formula]

[formula]

Fermion Singlet Majorana Dark Matter

Include a Majorana fermion singlet under SU(2)L,R and equal baryon and lepton number [formula] to the minimal set up for Lepto-Baryonic left-right symmetric theory. The relevant interactions for Majorana Dark Matter is given by

[formula]

The phenomenology of Majorana fermion dark matter via [formula]-portal as well as Higgs-portal will be studied in a separate work.

Conclusion

The Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right symmetric theory is addressed by defining lepton and baryon as local gauge symmetries. The one and two stage spontaneous breaking of this Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right symmetric theory to SM gauge theory via scalar triplets and scalar doublet is studied. The viability of Stable dark matter candidates as triplets, doublets and singlets (Dirac as well as Majorana fermion) in these gauge anomaly free theories is also discussed. The detailed numerical dark matter phenomenology has been omitted for a separate work. Towards the end the Lagrangian interaction for both triplet and doublet version of Lepto-Baryonic left-right symmetric theories has been provided.

Few gauge anomaly free Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right Models

The Lepto-Baryonic Left-Right symmetric models with gauge group [formula]- skipping the SU(3)C structure for simplicity- induces non-zero gauge anomalies in the theory,

[formula]

Although solutions to these gauge anomalies have been presented in refs.[\cite=He:1989mi] [\cite=Patra:2015vmp], it will be good to note them down here so that Dark Matter studies can be applicable to other scenarios also, if applicable, as

The simplest way to cancel gauge anomaly is to include fermion triplets [formula] as follows
