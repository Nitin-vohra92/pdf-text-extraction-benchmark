Blind Search for Variability in Planck Data

Introduction

Planck ([\cite=Tauber2010], [\cite=PlanckI2011]) provides 8 full sky surveys at the frequencies of its LFI instrument (30, 44, and 70 GHz), and 5 full surveys at the 6 HFI frequencies in the range 100-857 GHz. The satellite rotates with 1 rpm around an axis kept fixed for a pointing period (PID) of about 50 minutes, then shifts along the ecliptic by 2'. This keeps a point source near the ecliptic in the main beam (2 FWHM) for about 5  -  30 PIDs (depending on frequency) for each survey; for sources near the ecliptic poles the coverage can be much larger. Analysing the time information in Planck data for a particular sky direction thus allows to search for variability in the sky signal.

Mapping of time ordered information

Variability mapping is based on four-dimenional Healpix ([\cite=Healpix]) constructs called 4D-maps, which record for every sky pixel k all contributions of a given detector at times tj and beam orientation bj, where the index j refers to Planck PIDs. To construct an average sky signal Sk free from beam orientation effects, we use the ArtDeco beam deconvolution code ([\cite=ArtDeco]). A variability map is then a two-dimensional Healpix map of a quantity

Nk is the number of entries for pixel k in the 4D signal map Ikj, (S  *  b)kj is the beam-reconvolved average 4D-map based on the ArtDeco map Sk, [formula] is the detector white noise, and ξ combines all instrumental fluctuations which factor on the signal (e.g., calibration, inaccuracies of the beam model). The definition of X is motivated by the Chernoff bound on the CDF P N(χ2), with X  ≤    -   ln (1 - P N(χ2)) for 2  ≥  1, and X  >   ln P N(χ2) for 2  <  1. The distribution of X-values over a sky map is indicateive not only of variability, but also to incorrect estimations of noise and instrumental variations (see Fig. [\ref=fig1]).

Time resolved Planck fluxes, status and outlook

As the analysis of time variations in the sky is essentially background-free, our method provides a way to extract time resolved Planck fluxes down to a time resolution of a few hours. If the position of a variable point source is known, the residual 4D-map, Rkj  =  Ikj  -  (S  *  b)kj, can be beam-deconvolved to the source position by a simple division and thus provide an estimate of the flux variation, 〈ΔS(tj)〉k  =  Rkj / bkj, where bkj is a beamfactor map expressing the measured flux of a unit emitter at the source position in a beam centered at pixel k and time tj. This method is used, e.g., to extract time-resolved Planck fluxes for co-eval monitoring of blazars with the F-GAMMA program ([\cite=F-GAMMA], [\cite=BlazarPoster]).

Our analysis tools work on unified data structures, which ensures that all methods for variability analysis and flux extraction are applicable to LFI and HFI data in the same way. Interfaces for intitial 4D-mapping are in place at both the LFI and HFI DPC. We expect that all Planck frequencies will be analysed for variability, and science results prepared for publication well before the Planck Legacy release.
