Introduction

In the series of papers [\cite=na] [\cite=ns] [\cite=ns1] we study the question on whether the famous Golod-Shafarevich estimate, which gives a lower bound for the Hilbert series of a (noncommutative) algebra, is attained. This question was considered by Anick in his 1983 paper, "Generic algebras and CW-complexes" [\cite=ani1], in connection with the study of rationality of Poincare series associated to loop spaces. Here instead of looking at the Hilbert series as a whole, we concentrate on the conditions of vanishing of its certain component, that is on the condition of the nilpotency of given index. It turns out that in the case when the lower estimate of the number of relations necessary for the vanishing of a given component is rational, we can apply our technique to prove that this estimate is attained.

For a wider information on related problems about Golod-Shafarevich algebras see [\cite=Zelm] [\cite=Sm1] [\cite=Sm2] [\cite=Sm3] [\cite=Ersh], mentioned above papers [\cite=na] [\cite=ns] [\cite=ns1], and references therein.

Throughout this paper [formula] is an arbitrary field, [formula] is the set of non-negative integers and [formula] is the set of positive integers. For a real number t, ⌈t⌉ is the smallest integer [formula]. For a set X, [formula] stands for the free algebra over [formula] generated by X equipped with the natural degree grading, where each x∈X has degree 1. The symbol 〈X〉 stands for the set of all monomials (=words) in the alphabet X.

We deal with quadratic algebras, that is, algebras R given by homogeneous relations of degree 2. Such algebras inherit the described above grading of [formula] and are degree graded. If X is finite, one can consider the Hilbert series of R: where Rq is the space of homogeneous elements of R of degree q. See [\cite=popo] [\cite=ufnar] [\cite=vers] for more information on quadratic algebras.

A quadratic algebra R is called k-step nilpotent if Rk  =  {0}.

Note that if R is k-step nilpotent, then Rm  =  {0} for [formula]. Thus R is k-step nilpotent if and only if HR is a polynomial of degree < k, provided X is finite.

On the Hilbert series we consider a componentwise ordering: for two power series a(t) and b(t) with real coefficients we write [formula] if [formula] for all [formula]. Recall the following remarkable estimate of Golod and Shafarevich [\cite=gosh]. Although their result applies to any algebra defined by homogeneous relations, we state it here in the case of quadratic algebras.

In [\cite=popo] it is observed that Theorem GS implies the following result.

Anick [\cite=ani1] [\cite=ani2] proved that the estimate in Corollary GS is optimal for k = 3. Namely, [formula] and Anick has shown that for every [formula], there is a quadratic [formula]-algebra R given by n generators and [formula] relations such that R is 3-step nilpotent. The authors proved in [\cite=ns1] that the estimate from Corollary GS is asymptotically optimal for every [formula]. So far, the only numbers k for which the optimality was known were k = 2 (trivial) and k = 3 due to Anick. In [\cite=na], the authors have developed a technique of constructing quadratic algebras with small dimensions of the graded components. In the present paper this technique is enhanced and used to show that the estimate provided by Corollary GS is optimal for k = 5.

For every [formula], there exists a [formula]-algebra R given by n generators and [formula] homogeneous quadratic relations such that R is 5-step nilpotent.

Since [formula], Theorem [\ref=main] shows that the estimate in Corollary GS is optimal for k = 5. It is worth mentioning, that we take an advantage of the fact that φ5 is rational. Unfortunately, our method, as it is, does not work in the case when φk is irrational, and φ2 = 1, [formula] and [formula] are the only rational numbers among φk. For instance, [formula] and, hence, the optimality of Corollary GS for k = 4 and an arbitrary n remains an open question. In [\cite=ns1] it is shown that the estimate in Corollary GS for k = 4 is optimal when n is a Fibonacci number, while in [\cite=na] its optimality is verified for [formula]. Since 8 is a Fibonacci number, the optimality for [formula] follows. Note also that Theorem [\ref=main] provides yet another proof of the conjecture of Vershik [\cite=vers] that a generic quadratic algebra over an infinite field with [formula] generators and [formula] relations is finite dimensional.

Main lemma

In this section we describe an algorithm of obtaining an infinite collection of k-step nilpotent quadratic algebras from one k-step nilpotent quadratic algebra. This is an enhanced version of a similar algorithm from [\cite=na]. Note that in the present form, it still admits various generalizations.

Our data comprises [formula], two disjoint sets

[formula]

of pairwise distinct variables (=generators) xj,s and yk,t and the finite collection of scalars

[formula]

For [formula], let

[formula]

Note that [formula]. If [formula], by R(α,β) we denote the algebra given by the generator set [formula] and the quadratic relations

We need some extra notation. First, we denote the ideal in [formula] generated by the above relations by the symbol Iα,β. For a monomial (=a word) U in the alphabet [formula], its degree (=the number of letters) will be denoted [formula]. Consider the algebra homomorphisms

[formula]

defined by their action on the generators as follows: Sx(xj,s) = xj,s, Sx(yk,t) = 1, Sy(xj,s) = 1, Sy(yk,t) = yk,t, Φ(xj,s) = xj,1 and Φ(yk,t) = yk,1 for [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Informally speaking, Sx removes all yk,t from each monomial, while Sy removes all xj,s from each monomial. Obviously, for every [formula],

[formula]

If [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula], then we define [formula] to be the linear span of all [formula] for which [formula] and [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. It is straightforward to see that the space Hn of all homogeneous degree n elements of [formula] is the direct sum of the spaces [formula] for all admissible choices of nx, [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore,

[formula]

Next, if f is one of the relations defined in ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]) and [formula], then

[formula]

This easily follows from the shape of the relations f.

Let [formula] and f be one of the relations defined in ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]) with α  =  β = 1. Let also [formula] and [formula] be such that [formula] (they do exist and are unique according to ()). Then for every [formula] and [formula] with components bounded above by [formula] and [formula] respectively, there are unique [formula] and a unique relation f' from the list ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]) such that Φ(U'f'V') = UfV and [formula].

We can write

[formula]

Clearly, we can choose the (unique) [formula]

[formula]

Clearly, [formula]. Similarly, we can choose the (unique) [formula] such that

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]. If f = fxxp,1,1, we have c = a + 3 and d = b + 1 and we set f' = fxxp,sa + 1,sa + 2. If f = fyyq,1,1, we have c = a + 1 and d = b + 3 and we set f' = fyyq,tb + 1,tb + 2. Finally, if f = fxyr,1,1, we have c = a + 2, d = b + 2 and we set f' = fxyr,sa + 1,sb + 1. In any case, [formula] and Φ(U'f'V') = UfV.

Let [formula], and [formula]. Then W∈Iα,β if and only if Φ(W)∈I1,1.

It is easy to see that Φ(fxxp,a,b) = fxxp,1,1, Φ(fyyq,s,t) = fyyq,1,1 and Φ(fxyr,a,s) = fxyr,1,1 for all possible values of p, q, r, a, b, s and t, where the relations f are defined in ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]). It follows that Φ(Iα,β) = I1,1. Thus Φ(W)∈I1,1 if W∈Iα,β. It remains to show the converse. Assume that Φ(W)∈I1,1. Since [formula], W belongs to (exactly) one of the spaces [formula]. Note that [formula], [formula], the components of [formula] belong to [formula] and the components of [formula] belong to [formula]. Since Φ(W) is a degree n monomial and belongs to I1,1, we can write

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula] is a string of relations taken from ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]) with α  =  β = 1 (repetitions are allowed).

By Lemma [\ref=mut], there are [formula] and relations fm' from the list ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]) such that Φ(Um'fm'Vm') = UmfmVm and [formula] for each m. That is, the above display yields

[formula]

Since [formula] and each U'mf'mV'm belongs to [formula], ([\ref=isom]) implies that

[formula]

Since each f'm belongs to the ideal Iα,β, we have W∈Iα,β.

The following lemma is our key instrument.

If R(1,1) is n-step nilpotent, then R(α,β) is n-step nilpotent for every [formula].

Without loss of generality we can assume that [formula]. Assume that R(1,1) is n-step nilpotent. Let W be a degree n monomial in the alphabet [formula]. The proof will be complete if we verify that W belongs to the ideal Iα,β generated by the relations ([\ref=rab1]-[\ref=rab3]). Clearly, Φ(W) is a degree n monomial in the alphabet [formula]. Since R(1,1) is n-step nilpotent Φ(W)∈I1,1. By Lemma [\ref=monid], W∈Iα,β, which completes the proof.

Note that R(α,β) has exactly αgx  +  βgy generators and α2rxx  +  β2ryy  +  αβrxy relations. This observation and the shape of the relations in R(1,1) allow us to give the following reformulation of Lemma [\ref=key]. As usual, for subsets A and B of an algebra R, A  ·  B stands for [formula].

Assume that there exists a quadratic algebra R given by the (gx + gy)-element set [formula] of generators with |X| = gx and |Y| = gy, rxx relations belonging to X  ·  X, ryy relations belonging to Y  ·  Y and rxy relations belonging to X  ·  Y + Y  ·  X such that R is n-step nilpotent. Then for every [formula], there exists a quadratic [formula]-algebra R(α,β) given by αgx  +  βgy generators and α2rxx  +  β2ryy  +  αβrxy relations such that R(α,β) is n-step nilpotent.

Two specific algebras

Let [formula] be an arbitrary field and R3,1 be the [formula]-algebra given by 4 generators a,b,c,x and 6 relations cb - bc + aa, bb + aa - ac, cc - ba, xx, ax + bx - xa - xb and bx + cx - xa - xb - xc. Then R3,1 is 5-step nilpotent.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary field and R3,2 be the [formula]-algebra given by 5 generators a,b,c,x,y and 9 relations cb - bc + aa, bb + aa - ac, cc - ba, yy - xx, yx, ay + bx + cy - xb - yc, ax + by - xa - yb, cy + bx - ya - xb - yc and ax + by + cx - ya - xb. Then R3,2 is 5-step nilpotent.

Our proof of Lemmas [\ref=3-1] and [\ref=3-2] is computer assisted. We order the generators by a < b < c < x for R3,1 and by a < b < c < x < y for R3,2 and use the degree lexicographical ordering on the monomials. We have used the program Bergman [\cite=berg] developed by Jörgen Backelin (Stockholm University). The software allows to obtain the Gröbner basis and the Hilbert series of an associative algebra given by generators and homogeneous relations. We list the (finite) Gröbner bases of R3,1 and of R3,2 in the case char[formula] in the appendix. Note that the elements of the Gröbner bases are given as members of [formula] for R3,1 and as members of [formula] for R3,2. For each of the algebras R3,1 and R3,2 we have run the program twice specifying [formula] for the first run and [formula] for the second. The reason for this will be apparent straight away.

Right now we point out only the relevant consequences of the output:

[formula]

Now we are ready to prove Lemmas [\ref=3-1] and [\ref=3-2].  Let p be an odd prime number. By ([\ref=fof2]) none of the leading coefficients of the members gj of the characteristic 0 Gröbner bases of R3,1 and R3,2 is a multiple of p. It follows that if we replace all the coefficients c of each [formula] by the corresponding cosets [formula], we obtain Gröbner bases of R3,1 and R3,2 in the case [formula] and the leading monomials are the same as in the case [formula]. Since the Hilbert series is uniquely determined by the set of leading monomials of the Gröbner basis, the Hilbert series of R3,1 and R3,2 in the case [formula] are the same as in the case [formula]. Looking at ([\ref=fof1]), we see that

[formula]

It immediately follows that R3,1 and R3,2 are 5-step nilpotent, which completes the proof of Lemmas [\ref=3-1] and [\ref=3-2].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

In this section we derive Theorem [\ref=main] from Corollary [\ref=gjsdfg] and Lemmas [\ref=3-1] and [\ref=3-2].

By Lemma [\ref=3-1], there exists a quadratic algebra R3,1 given by the set [formula] of generators with X = {a,b,c} and Y = {x}, 3 relations (cb - bc + aa, bb + aa - ac and cc - ba) from X  ·  X, 1 relation (being xx) from Y  ·  Y and 2 relations (ax + bx - xa - xb and bx + cx - xa - xb - xc) from X  ·  Y + Y  ·  X such that R3,1 is 5-step nilpotent. By Corollary [\ref=gjsdfg] with [formula] and β = 0, we see that

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=gjsdfg] applied to the same algebra R3,1 with [formula] and β = 1, we see that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=3-2], there exists a quadratic algebra R3,2 given by the set [formula] of generators with X = {a,b,c} and Y = {x,y}, 3 relations (cb - bc + aa, bb + aa - ac and cc - ba) from X  ·  X, 2 relation (yy - xx and yx) from Y  ·  Y and 4 relations (ay + bx + cy - xb - yc, ax + by - xa - yb, cy + bx - ya - xb - yc and ax + by + cx - ya - xb) from X  ·  Y + Y  ·  X such that R is 5-step nilpotent. By Corollary [\ref=gjsdfg] with [formula] and β = 1, we see that

[formula]

The formulae ([\ref=3+0]-[\ref=3+2]) show that for every [formula], there is a quadratic [formula]-algebra Rn given by n generators and [formula] relations such that Rn is 5-step nilpotent. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Concluding remarks and open questions

We start by reiterating the message that the optimality of Corollary GS for k∉{2,3,5} remains an open question.

Let k be an integer such that k = 4 or [formula]. Is it true that for each [formula], there is a k-step nilpotent quadratic algebra given by n generators and ⌈φkn2⌉ relations?

Another consequence of Theorem GS is the following corollary.

The question of the optimality of Corollary GS1 remains open as well.

Let [formula] and d be an integer strictly greater than [formula]. Is it true that there is a finite dimensional quadratic algebra given by n generators and d relations?

Note that Wisliceny [\cite=wis] proved that Corollary GS1 is asymptotically optimal. Namely, he proved that for every [formula] there is a semigroup quadratic algebra (every relation is either a monomial of degree 2 or a difference of 2 monomials of degree 2) given by n generators and [formula] relations. The authors [\cite=ns] proved that in the class of semigroup quadratic algebras with n generators, the minimal number of relations required for the algebra to be finite dimensional is exactly the first integer strictly greater than [formula]. In particular, this roughly halves the gap between the [formula] of Corollary GS1 and about [formula] of Wisliceny. As it is observed in [\cite=ns], for [formula], the number of semigroup quadratic relations on [formula] generators required for k-step nilpotency is strictly greater than the number of general quadratic relations. Due to Anick [\cite=ani1], these numbers are the same for k = 3. The case k = 4 remains a mystery, which leads to the following question.

Let [formula]. Is it true that there is a 4-step nilpotent semigroup quadratic algebra given by n generators and ⌈φ4n2⌉ relations?

To make the above question more appealing, we make the following observation.

The answer to Question [formula] is affirmative for [formula].

Note that for [formula], the numbers ⌈φ4n2⌉ are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10. Consider the algebras Rn for [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then each Rn for [formula] is given by n generators and ⌈φ4n2⌉ semigroup quadratic relations. The proof will be complete if we show that each Rn is 4-step nilpotent. The fact that R1, R2 and R3 are 4-step nilpotent is easily verifiable by hand (in fact R1 is 2-step nilpotent and R2 is 3-step nilpotent). We have again used BERGMAN to verify that R4 and R5 are 4-step nilpotent. Since for a semigroup algebra the Hilbert series does not depend on the underlying field, we can run the program to obtain the Hilbert series of Rn choosing an arbitrary characteristic of [formula] (we have opted for char[formula]). This gives the Hilbert series of Rn:

[formula]

Thus each Rn for [formula] is 4-step nilpotent.

We have to confess that the algebras R4 and R5 in the above proof are obtained via computer assisted guesswork.
