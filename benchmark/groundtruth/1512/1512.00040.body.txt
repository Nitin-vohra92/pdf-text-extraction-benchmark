Scalar Leptons in Folded Supersymmetry

Introduction

With the recent discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC [\cite=Aad:2012tfa] [\cite=Chatrchyan:2012ufa] the standard model (SM) spectrum is now complete. Furthermore, to the extent that they have been tested, the Higgs boson couplings appear to be in agreement with the SM predictions. When we add this new information from the Higgs sector of the theory to the previously existing measurements on the gauge interactions, one can conclude that the SM not only appears to be valid at the weak scale, but is probably valid at energies well above it. Among the reasons to conclude that this extrapolation is warranted are the apparent consistency of the Higgs potential with only renormalizable interactions and the lack of deviations of the Higgs couplings to SM gauge bosons and fermions. Finally, there is the absence of new states at the weak scale.

Although it might be too early in the life of the LHC to assume that this situation will stand, it is interesting to examine the consequences it would have on naturalness. As it is and with mh = 125 ~ GeV, if it is valid up to energies well above the weak scale the SM is fine tuned, with the tuning roughly given by v2 / M2, with v≃246 ~ GeV and M the SM ultraviolet (UV) scale. The absence of deviations from the SM, both in electroweak precision measurements and from direct searches, seem to point to [formula] few TeV. Models that try to explain this gap between the scales v and M, the so-called little hierarchy, need to protect mh in one of two ways: through a spontaneously broken global symmetry, or supersymmetry. In the first case, the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) and the theory must be UV-completed above M by a new strong dynamics. In general, the Higgs couplings are modified and new states are present around the weak scale, some of which carry color. On the other hand, supersymmetric extensions of the SM do not significantly modify Higgs couplings, although they predict several new states not far from the weak scale, including color-carrying scalars.

These models become less natural as the bounds on new states become stronger. These constraints are mostly driven by the LHC searches of new colored states. In the case of composite Higgs models, the precise measurements of the Higgs couplings are an additional constraint. This situation is somewhat alleviated in models that realized the so-called neutral naturalness. These are theories where the symmetry partners of the top quark responsible for the cancellation of the top contribution to the Higgs mass UV sensitivity, do not carry SU(3)c quantum numbers. When the Higgs is protected by a spontaneously broken global symmetry (pNGB Higgs) these are called Twin Higgs models [\cite=Twnhggs2006]. The protection is done by supersymmetry in the so-called Folded Supersymmetric models [\cite=fldsusy2007], which are the focus of this paper.

In Folded SUSY, the low energy spectrum below the scale M contains, in addition to the SM states, the scalar partners of the top quark which couple just as the stop quarks would in typical SUSY models but carry no color quantum numbers. The cancellation of the Higgs mass UV sensitivity is ensured by a supersymmetry broken at the high scale M. The light scalar uncolored top partners, dubbed the f-stops, realize an accidental supersymmetry of the low energy spectrum below M. Above M the theory contains both colored and uncolored partners of the SM particles.

UV completions of Folded SUSY can be obtained in five-dimensional (5D) supersymmetric theories compactified on an orbifold [\cite=fldsusy2007]. Supersymmetry is broken by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism [\cite=Scherk:1978ta] by boundary conditions at M≃1 / R, where R is the compactification radius. In order to obtain the accidental SUSY spectrum below 1 / R with uncolored f-stops instead of stops, it is necessary to enlarge the gauge symmetry of the SM to contain at least one extra copy of SU(3). For instance, if hypermultiplets containing the quark fields are charged under an SU(6) bulk gauge symmetry, broken by boundary conditions down to SU(3)c  ×  SU(3)', it is possible to arrange the orbifold procedure in order to obtain fermion zero modes charged under the SM SU(3)c and scalar quark zero modes charged under SU(3)'. The f-squarks are charged under the electroweak SM gauge group and couple to the W±, Z and the photon.

The phenomenology of Folded SUSY models presents several novel features, many of which are shared by other neutral natural models. In particular, since f-squarks are expected to be much heavier than ΛQCD' they do not hadronize when pair-produced at colliders [\cite=Burdman:2008ek]. Instead, they form a highly excited state that would promptly radiate both photons and SU(3)' glueballs in order to go to the onium ground state, after which it decays back to SM states. For instance, bounds on f-squarks can be obtained from LHC data on Wγ resonances, considering the Ũ  -   electroweak pair production resulting in bounds of approximately 450 ~ GeV [\cite=Burdman:2014zta]. Additionally, the glueballs of SU(3)' might decay back to SM states through highly displaced vertices [\cite=Craig:2015pha] [\cite=Curtin:2015fna]. In this paper we are concerned with the lepton sector of Folded SUSY. Although it plays very little role in the taming of the Higgs UV sensitivity, the fact that the f-sleptons are typically lighter than the f-squarks and are produced through similar interactions makes them phenomenologically interesting. We will consider minimal particle content Folded SUSY models and show that the presence of light f-sleptons is generically unavoidable and even dangerous. In fact, in order to avoid running into serious trouble with cosmological bounds, the f-sleptons must decay. This is achieved through higher dimensional operators, which are naturally present in the 5D theory. Even then, their lifetimes are typically long on collider scales leading to interesting bounds. Here we explore the spectrum and phenomenology of the f-sleptons, the constraints that they impose on Folded SUSY models and the prospect for new signals.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section we review the 5D UV completions of Folded SUSY, in Section [\ref=sec:fslepton] we discuss the lepton sector and in Section [\ref=sec:pheno] we study the f-slepton phenomenology at the LHC. We conclude in Section [\ref=sec:con].

Folded Supersymmetry from 5D Orbifolds

The aim of a UV completion of Folded SUSY is to have uncolored stop quarks at low energies that still protect the Higgs mass from quadratic UV sensitivity. Typically light squarks will be charged under an SU(3) gauge symmetry other than QCD. This requires extending the SM gauge sector to accommodate at least two copies of SU(3). In order to obtain this low energy spectrum we consider a flat extra dimension compactified on a S1 / Z2 orbifold. In the 5D bulk the theory is supersymmetric. We assume that Supersymmetry is broken by boundary conditions by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism [\cite=Scherk:1978ta]. Since the QCD sector of the 5D theory is extended to include at least another SU(3), it is possible to carefully choose the boundary conditions such that bulk quark hypermultiplets will have fermion zero modes charged under QCD, but scalar zero modes charged under the additional SU(3). We consider here the so-called maximal twist, in which the N = 1 supersymmetries preserved at the extradimensional fixed points are related by a maximal SU(2)R rotation. This choice ensures that at any given Kaluza-Klein level fermions and bosons are degenerate even if they belong to a different representation of the bulk gauge group. This guarantees that the one loop cancellation of the top quark contributions to m2h is propagated throughout the tower. Although this choice of twist may not have by itself a Higgs potential with the correct electroweak vacuum, we will see below that this is likely to be solved when considering the presence of additional sources of SUSY breaking. Models with less-than-maximal twist are considered in Ref. [\cite=Cohen:2015gaa].

At low energies the couplings of the Higgs to third generation up quarks and (uncolored) squarks are

[formula]

Then, although SUSY is not present in the low energy spectrum (e.g. Q and [formula] are not related by SUSY transformations), there is still and accidental supersymmetry that guarantees the cancellation of quadratic divergences at one loop.

Since SUSY has been broken by boundary conditions, this means that the part of the spectrum that is absent below the compactification scale acquires masses of the order of 1 / R. The Folded SUSY mechanism protects m2h at one loop. Two loop quadratically divergent contributions from the top sector will begin to be of O(1)  m2h at around 5 ~ TeV. Thus, if we choose [formula] TeV, the Little Hierarchy problem is solved by the colorless top partners up until this scale, where the full 5D SUSY spectrum re-appears. Values of 1 / R much above this will result in increased fine tuning.

The minimal fully realistic model of Folded SUSY has the gauge symmetry SU(3)A  ×  SU(3)B  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y  ×  Z2 [\cite=Burdman:2008ek]. Here the Z2 exchanges A and B, the SU(3)A corresponds to the SM color, whereas SU(3)B is the mirror color gauge group. The gauge fields propagate in the bulk of a 5D space compactified on S1 / Z2, with fixed points at y = 0 and y = πR. As mentioned earlier, SUSY in the 5D bulk results in the following hypermultiplets, from which the SM quarks and their f-superpartners emerge:

[formula]

where the labels A and B denote SM fields and f-partners respectively, and we have omitted generation indices. The quantum number assignments in ([\ref=hyperquarks]) correspond to SU(3)A  ×  SU(3)B  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y. Similarly, the lepton sector is obtained from the hypermultiplets

[formula]

The zero-mode folded scalars acquire masses through non-local radiative corrections in the bulk. The contributions from the gauge interactions is given by [\cite=Antoniadis:1998sd] [\cite=Delgado:1998qr]

[formula]

There are also contributions coming from Yukawa interactions but these are only significant for the third generation. For the up-type squarks they result in

[formula]

In addition to Scherk-Schwarz SUSY Breaking (SSSB), there are likely other sources of SUSY breaking coming from brane-localized Kahler operators [\cite=Dimopoulos:2014aua] [\cite=Garcia:2015sfa]. Their origin is related to the need to dynamically stabilize the extradimensional radius with a vanishing four dimensional cosmological constant. The desired effect can be parametrized by a singlet brane-localized chiral superfield X with

[formula]

where the F-term is chosen to cancel the typical contributions to the Casimir energies from bulk fields [\cite=vonGersdorff:2003rq] and contributes additional soft masses. The relevant terms for soft masses are generically of the form

[formula]

where ψ = Q,U,D,L,E. The coefficients satisfy cψ  ~  O(1). This can result in O(1) corrections to the soft masses in ([\ref=fslpmass]) and ([\ref=fsqrthird]), affecting the rather predictive relations between them and 1 / R.

The resulting localized SUSY-breaking Kahler operators might also be of importance in order to obtain satisfactory EWSB through terms of the form

[formula]

with Hi = Hu,Hd.

Light Sleptons in Folded SUSY

The A and B lepton hypermultiplets in ([\ref=hyperleptons]) share the same gauge quantum numbers. So in principle it appears unnecessary to introduce this duplication in the spectrum, just having one of the two as a singlet of the ZAB exchange symmetry would be enough. However, this is not possible since it would introduce an unwanted Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. The dangerous FI terms come from the one loop tadpole contributions of scalars to the hypercharge D term, DY [\cite=Ghilencea:2001bw] . These are depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:filoop]. In the absence of B and ẼB the one-loop FI term contribution to the Higgs mass squared coming from the B-type squarks is

[formula]

where Λ is the cutoff of the 5D theory. This is cancelled by the B and ẼB contributions. For comparison, the minimal model contains a one loop contribution to m2h from the electroweak sector given by

[formula]

which is cutoff by the gauginos at 1 / R instead of Λ. Furthermore, the contribution in ([\ref=gaugetomh2]) can be reduced in extensions of Folded SUSY where the electroweak sector is embedded in a larger gauge group such as SU(4) [\cite=fldsusy2007]. Thus, the FI terms in ([\ref=fitomh2]) would result in a sizable tuning of the Higgs mass which is not really present even in the minimal model. This can be avoided by introducing the B hypermultiplet. This is a generic feature of Folded SUSY models, as long as FI terms are to be avoided.

Given the choice of boundary conditions outlined in the previous section, the hypermultiplets L̂B and ÊB result in scalar zero modes with similar quantum numbers as the MSSM sleptons. As it was pointed out in Ref. [\cite=fldsusy2007], at the level of renormalizable interactions these folded scalar leptons are stable as long as R-parity is conserved. Also operators of the type AHAEB  +  BHBEA, that could in principle lead to prompt two-body decays of f-sleptons , will not do so in models where the electroweak sector is also folded such as the SU(4) extension mentioned above.

However, non-renormalizable interactions of the type

[formula]

and

[formula]

are present and will lead to the decay of the f-sleptons. In ([\ref=nonren1]) and ([\ref=nonren2]) Λ is the cutoff of the 5D theory, and flavor indices have been suppressed. These operators contain a vertex of f-sleptons into two quarks and a heavy squark all carrying color. Integrating out the heavy squark results in the decay vertex of f-sleptons into three quarks and the LSP, which here we are assuming to be the higgsino. In the next section we will study the phenomenology associated with the decays of f-sleptons.

Phenomenology of Folded Sleptons

Written in components the operator O1 in ([\ref=nonren1]) is

[formula]

where the greek indices denote SU(3)c, the latin indices stand for flavor, and we are still using superfield notation. For simplicity, we drop the subindex A when it refers to a SM color-carrying field. Similarly, the operator O2 in ([\ref=nonren2]) can be expanded into

[formula]

We are interested in extracting the decay vertices for the f-sleptons. Although in general we could consider the decays of both ẼBR and ÑB (assuming ẼBL is heavy enough to beta-decay to ÑB) we will focus on the singlet which is likely to be much lighter than the doublet, resulting in larger production cross sections. As we will see below, the lifetime of ẼBR is often long compared to typical detector sizes. Thus, the most stringent bounds will come from the visible tracks of ẼBR going through all or part of the detector.

Among the vertices that can be extracted from O2 in ([\ref=o2incomp]), we are particularly interested in those containing two light quarks and a squark. These squarks have masses of order 1 / R and when integrated out result in a coupling to the corresponding quark and the higgsino, which we assume here to be the LSP. Thus the effective vertex will be proportional to the Yukawa coupling of the squark integrated out, and the decay rate should be dominated by the intermediate stop resulting in a final state with two jets a top and missing energy whenever kinematically allowed. The resulting dimension-seven effective operator has the form

[formula]

where c2  ~  O(1) and qR = uR,cR,tR and similarly for ŨR.

We are now in a position to estimate the lifetime of the right-handed folded slepton ẼBR. As discussed in Section [\ref=sec:folded], in the absence of additional sources of SUSY breaking the f-slepton masses are given by ([\ref=fslpmass]). For instance, for 1 / R = 5 ~ TeV we have mẼBR≃125 ~ GeV. The dominant decay channel is then the charm, plus two jets plus missing energy. In order to estimate the lifetime, we use Λ  =  4 / R and c2 = 1 to obtain τẼBR≃4  ×  105  ~  s. Such a long lifetime has several problems. Even if we were to ignore the constraints from BBN, there are direct searches for stable charged particles that put severe bounds on mẼBR [\cite=ATLAS:2014fka] [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013oca]. We derive a mass exclusion from the CMS constraints on heavy stable charged particles. The production cross section of the ẼBR is the same as the direct electroweak production cross section of right handed staus in typical supersymmetric scenarios. Assuming stability throughout the detector, the best bound is [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013oca]

[formula]

at 95% C.L. This bound applies to the f-slepton since for this value of the mass the lifetime in this simplified case is τẼBR≃10- 5  ~  s, corresponding to cτẼBR≃3600 ~ m. The bound is even more constraining if we take into account the fact that there are three almost degenerate folded scalar leptons. The splittings among them come from the Yukawa couplings to the Higgs and are at most

[formula]

which results in a f-stau a few GeV heavier than the f-selectron and the f-smuon for 1 / R  ~  5 ~ TeV. Taking this into account and multiplying the production cross section by an appropriate factor we obtain the bound

[formula]

at 95% C.L.

The bounds in ([\ref=ssbound]) and ([\ref=ssboundx3]) are rather stringent if the spectrum of folded sfermions is solely determined by Scherk-Schwarz SUSY breaking, i.e. by ([\ref=fslpmass]) and ([\ref=fsqrthird]). For instance, in order to obtain mẼBR = 339 ~ GeV, we need 1 / R≃13 ~ TeV, which translates into f-stop masses above 1 ~ TeV. For the bound in ([\ref=ssboundx3]) the top partner mass reaches 1.3 ~ TeV. Such large values would reintroduce significant fine tuning in the Higgs mass. This situation is relaxed when considering additional sources of SUSY breaking such as the ones introduced in eq. ([\ref=kahler]), since these result typically in order one corrections to the zero-mode soft masses. In what follows we will obtain projections for the LHC bounds with [formula] TeV for both cases, with and without the additional SUSY-breaking terms.

As mentioned above, the right-handed f-slepton decay in the case without additional SUSY breaking occurs mostly outside the detector. The lifetime of ẼBR becomes small enough for a significant fraction of decays to happen inside the detector only for [formula]GeV. This can be seen from the top curve in Figure [\ref=fig:ctauvsmass], where we plot cτẼBR vs. the right-handed f-slepton mass. On the other hand, with additional SUSY breaking as in eq. ([\ref=kahler]), the situation changes. To get an idea of the effect we consider FX = 1 / (πR)2, and cψ = 1 for all flavors. As a result a significant number of decays occur inside the detector for lighter masses. This can be seen in the bottom curve of Figure ([\ref=fig:ctauvsmass]), for masses above 500 GeV we have a significant fraction of decays in the outer regions of the detector.

We can estimate the reach of the heavy stable charged particles search at [formula]TeV. We extrapolate the bounds obtained by CMS in [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013oca] for [formula]TeV using a procedure similar to [\cite=CReach]. In our Figures a mass is excluded for a given luminosity if the number of events produced at [formula]TeV is equal or greater than the number needed for the exclusion of stau direct production in the [formula]TeV CMS analysis. In both cases the relevant events are those before cuts, but we count only those for which the f-slepton does not decay inside the detector. The CMS analysis [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013oca] sets a bound also on particles that look stable only inside the tracker. For each luminosity we show the strongest exclusion between the tracker-only and the full detector searches. To determine the distance travelled by the f-sleptons inside the experimental apparatus we use their generator level η distribution simulated using MadGraph 5 [\cite=Alwall:2011uj].

In Figure [\ref=fig:1gen] we plot the RH f-slepton mass excluded at 95% C.L. vs the required luminosity for the one generation case. The top curve corresponds to the original SSSB spectrum, whereas the bottom one includes the additional sources of SUSY breaking mentioned above. The spectrum fully determined by SSSB requires 2  ab- 1 to exclude a 800 ~ GeV mass. With additional sources of SUSY breaking a large fraction of events would result in decays inside the detector. Thus, the stable particles search looses sensitivity and the bounds are degraded, as shown in the bottom curve of Figure [\ref=fig:1gen]. The tracker-only search has a lower sensitivity and does not improve the bound. Figure [\ref=fig:3gen] corresponds to the case of three degenerate species of f-sleptons. However, since the coefficients of additional SUSY-breaking operators in ([\ref=kahler]) may have a non-trivial flavor structure [\cite=Garcia:2014lfa] this situation may not be generic. Thus, we should consider the bottom curve of Figure [\ref=fig:3gen] as an estimate of the best case scenario for experiments. Here the tracker-only search for stable particles allows to gain some sensitivity with high integrated luminosity, as signaled by the change in slope of the plot above 1  ab- 1. If additional supersymmetry breaking is present, the f-sleptons decay inside the detector most of the time for [formula] GeV and searches for displaced vertices in the inner tracker, the calorimeters and the muon system become the most sensitive channels. We have estimated that a tracker-only search for displaced vertices plus jets as the one described in [\cite=Aad:2015rba] would exclude slepton masses between 500 and 850 GeV with 3 - 1 of integrated luminosity, even if the peak efficiency on the signal of the kinematical cuts was as low as 5%. This shows that the sensitivity lost by the stable particles search can be recovered and the LHC will have roughly the same mass reach in the SSSB case and if additional SUSY breaking is present. Furthermore, in the event of a discovery, including information from the calorimeters [\cite=Aad:2015asa] and the muon system [\cite=Aad:2015uaa] could allow a measurement of the slepton lifetime. A more detailed estimate of the reach of the LHC for [formula]TeV, particularly for the case of mostly in-detector decays is left for future work.

Conclusion

We have examined the lepton sector of Folded SUSY theories. In particular, we have shown that it is necessary to include two sets of lepton hypermultiplets with identical quantum numbers, labeled A and B, in order to avoid dangerous Fayet-Iliopoulos terms which could reintroduce a cutoff dependence of the Higgs mass. The resulting spectrum includes, in addition to the SM leptons, scalar leptons of the B type, the lightest of which is the hypercharge YB =  - 1. This f-slepton is stable unless higher dimensional operators, always present in the UV completions studied here, are considered. The resulting decay rate is suppressed by the cutoff Λ as well as by the mass of the colored squarks which is of O(1 / R). If SUSY is exclusively broken by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism, the relation between the soft masses and the compactification scale in eq. ([\ref=fslpmass]) results in f-sleptons that are largely stable on collider scales. From this we can extract a bound on the f-slepton mass that can be turned into a top-partner mass exclusion. For one species of f-sleptons this is mẼB > 339 ~ GeV, which translates into MT̃ > 1 TeV. The bound is actually stronger when considering that there are three nearly degenerate species of f-sleptons: mẼB > 420 ~ GeV and MT̃ > 1.3 TeV. This constitutes a stringent constraint on naturalness.

The situation can be ameliorated by the presence of additional SUSY-breaking sources, as shown in eqs.([\ref=kahler]) and ([\ref=kahlerhiggs]). They arise as a consequence of a dynamical stabilization of the extradimensional radius. Their presence may be crucial in obtaining satisfactory EWSB through terms as in ([\ref=kahlerhiggs]). But centrally for this work, the terms in ([\ref=kahler]) introduce additional soft mass terms with order one uncertainties that break the direct relation between masses and 1 / R given by ([\ref=fslpmass]). This makes it possible for f-slepton mass to be larger without increasing correspondingly 1 / R, diluting the power of the f-slepton mass bounds on the top-partner masses and consequently on naturalness. This has the consequence of making f-slepton decays faster, to the point that decays inside the detectors should be observable during the [formula]TeV run at the LHC. This work motivates a more careful study of f-slepton decays by the experimental collaborations. However it is possible to estimate that the LHC experiments will be sensitive to masses as large as (800 - 850) ~ GeV with 3 - 1 of integrated luminosity.
