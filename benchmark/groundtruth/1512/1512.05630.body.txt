Introduction

Feynman integrals are uttermost important for precision calculations in particle physics. Due to the presence of ultraviolet or infrared divergences these integrals may require regularisation. It is common practice to use dimensional regularisation [\cite='tHooft:1972fi] [\cite=Bollini:1972ui] [\cite=Cicuta:1972jf] with regularisation parameter ε and to present the result for a Feynman integral as a Laurent series in ε. It is a natural question to ask, what transcendental functions appear in the εj-term. For one-loop integrals and for the expansion around four space-time dimensions the answer for the ε0-term is simple: There are just two transcendental functions. These are the logarithm

[formula]

and the dilogarithm

[formula]

Of course we would like to generalise this to multi-loop integrals, to expansions around any even space-time dimension and to arbitrary order εj. There is a wide class of Feynman integrals for which this can be done. These Feynman integrals evaluate to generalisations of the two transcendental functions above, called multiple polylogarithms. The multiple polylogarithms are defined by [\cite=Goncharov_no_note] [\cite=Goncharov:2001] [\cite=Borwein]

[formula]

The multiple polylogarithms have also a representation as iterated integrals and enjoy several nice algebraic properties: There is a shuffle and a quasi-shuffle product, derived from the integral and sum representation, respectively. Methods for the numerical evaluation are available [\cite=Vollinga:2004sn]. This allows that a wide class of Feynman integrals can be computed systematically to all orders in ε. Algorithms which accomplish this are for example based on nested sums [\cite=Moch:2001zr] [\cite=Weinzierl:2002hv] [\cite=Weinzierl:2004bn] [\cite=Moch:2005uc] [\cite=Bierenbaum:2003ud], linear reducibility [\cite=Brown:2008] [\cite=Panzer:2014caa] [\cite=Bogner:2015unknown] or differential equations [\cite=Kotikov:1990kg] [\cite=Kotikov:1991pm] [\cite=Remiddi:1997ny] [\cite=Gehrmann:1999as] [\cite=Argeri:2007up] [\cite=MullerStach:2012mp] [\cite=Henn:2013pwa]. On the mathematical side, multiple polylogarithms are closely related to punctured Riemann surfaces of genus zero [\cite=Goncharov:2001] [\cite=Brown:2006] [\cite=Bogner:2014mha].

There are however Feynman integrals, which cannot be expressed in multiple polylogarithms. The aim of this paper is to study how the class of multiple polylogarithms needs to be extended. The simplest Feynman integral which cannot be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms is the two-loop sunrise integral with non-vanishing masses. This Feynman integral has already received considerable attention in the literature [\cite=Broadhurst:1993mw] [\cite=Berends:1993ee] [\cite=Bauberger:1994nk] [\cite=Bauberger:1994by] [\cite=Bauberger:1994hx] [\cite=Caffo:1998du] [\cite=Laporta:2004rb] [\cite=Groote:2005ay] [\cite=Groote:2012pa] [\cite=Bailey:2008ib] [\cite=MullerStach:2011ru] [\cite=Adams:2013nia] [\cite=Bloch:2013tra] [\cite=Remiddi:2013joa] [\cite=Adams:2014vja] [\cite=Adams:2015gva] [\cite=Caffo:2002ch] [\cite=Pozzorini:2005ff] [\cite=Caffo:2008aw]. In this paper we study the two-loop sunrise integral with equal non-zero masses in D = 2 - 2ε space-time dimensions. Considering the sunrise integral in 2 - 2ε dimensions instead of 4 - 2ε dimensions is no restriction: With the help of dimensional recurrence relations [\cite=Tarasov:1996br] [\cite=Tarasov:1997kx] one recovers the result in 4 - 2ε dimensions from the result in 2 - 2ε dimensions. Working in D = 2 - 2ε dimensions has the advantage that the leading term in the ε-expansion (in D = 2 - 2ε dimensions the two-loop sunrise integral is finite and the ε-expansions starts with ε0) depends only on one graph polynomial, but not both. The zero locus of this graph polynomial describes an elliptic curve, i.e. a Riemann surface of genus one. The higher terms in the ε-expansion depend of course on both graph polynomials. The other graph polynomial describes a Riemann surface of genus zero. This gives us already an indication, what transcendental functions we should expect: As multiple polylogarithms correspond to the pure genus zero case, we are looking for a generalisation which corresponds to a combination of genus one and genus zero. The lowest term in the ε-expansion will correspond to a pure genus one case.

In this paper we define a class of functions, which can be seen as a generalisation of the multiple polylogarithms to the mixed genus one / genus zero case. This class includes the multiple polylogarithms. The new additional functions are

[formula]

We show that each term of the ε-expansion of the two-loop sunrise integral can be expressed in this class of functions and we give an algorithm to compute the term of order εj. In an appendix we present the explicit results for the first three terms of the ε-expansion.

On a technical level this is achieved by considering the differential equation for the two-loop sunrise integral. We bring the differential equation to a particularly useful form, such that all integrations (after an appropriate change of variables) can be carried out easily. This step is inspired by Henn's method [\cite=Henn:2013pwa] in the genus zero case. In this particular form of the differential equation it is straightforward to show that we always stay within the specific class of functions. We would like to stress that the change of variables from the momentum squared t = p2 to the nome of the elliptic curve q is crucial [\cite=Bloch:2013tra] [\cite=Adams:2014vja]: We will see that all integrands have nice forms in the variable q.

This paper is organised as follows: In section [\ref=sec:notation] we define the two-loop sunrise integral and we introduce our notation. In section [\ref=sec:elliptic_variables] we review variables naturally associated to the elliptic curve. In section [\ref=sec:dgl_trafo] we derive a particularly useful form of the differential equation for the two-loop sunrise integral with equal masses around two space-time dimensions. This form allows us to obtain the εj-term of the Laurent expansion from lower order terms and (simple) integrations. The solution of a differential equation requires in addition boundary values. These are discussed in section [\ref=sec:boundary_values]. In section [\ref=sec:functions] we introduce the class of functions, in which the two-loop sunrise integral can be expressed. Section [\ref=sec:algorithm] contains the main result of this paper and gives an algorithm to compute the εj-term in the Laurent expansion of the two-loop sunrise integral. Finally, our conclusions are given in section [\ref=sec:conclusions]. In an appendix we present the explicit results for the first three terms of the ε-expansion of the two-loop sunrise integral.

Basic set-up

The two-loop integral corresponding to the sunrise graph with equal masses is given in D-dimensional Minkowski space by

[formula]

The arbitrary scale μ is introduced to keep the integral dimensionless. The quantity p2 denotes the momentum squared (with respect to the Minkowski metric) and we will write

[formula]

Where it is not essential we will suppress the dependence on the mass m and the scale μ and simply write S111(D,t) instead of S111(D,t,m2,μ2). In terms of Feynman parameters the two-loop integral is given by

[formula]

with the two Feynman graph polynomials

[formula]

The differential two-form ω is given by

[formula]

and the integration is over

[formula]

For the sunrise integral any integral obtained by pinching propagators is a product of tadpole integrals. The tadpole integral is given by

[formula]

It has been known for a long time that in the equal mass case the two-loop sunrise integral satisfies a second-order differential equation for all values of D [\cite=Broadhurst:1993mw] [\cite=Laporta:2004rb]:

[formula]

with T1(D - 2) = T1(D - 2,m2,μ2) and

[formula]

Variables related to the elliptic curve

We may view the graph polynomial F as a polynomial in the Feynman parameters x1, x2, x3 with parameters t and m2. The algebraic equation

[formula]

defines together with the choice of a rational point as origin an elliptic curve. The modulus k and the complementary modulus k' of the elliptic curve are given by

[formula]

The variables e1, e2 and e3 are the roots of the cubic polynomial of the Weierstrass normal form y2 = 4(x - e1)(x - e2)(x - e3) and given in terms of the parameters of the elliptic curve by

[formula]

As abbreviation we used

[formula]

The periods of the elliptic curve can be taken as

[formula]

K(x) and E(x) denote the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and second kind, respectively:

[formula]

We denote the ratio of the two periods ψ2 and ψ1 by

[formula]

and the nome by

[formula]

We may express the variable t as a function of the nome q (and we will use this change of variables extensively in the rest of the paper):

[formula]

where η(τ) denotes Dedekind's η-function

[formula]

The first few terms read

[formula]

The Wronskian is given by

[formula]

We further denote by rn the n-th root of unity

[formula]

In particular we will need the third root of unity

[formula]

A particularly useful form of the differential equation

We study the two-loop sunrise integral around two space-time dimensions. We therefore set D = 2 - 2ε. The Feynman parameter integral reads

[formula]

The algebraic curve defined by F = 0 has genus 1, the algebraic curve defined by U = 0 has genus 0. The algebraic curve given by F = 0 defines together with the choice of a rational point as origin an elliptic curve. At order ε0 the two-loop sunrise integral depends only on the graph polynomial F, but not on the graph polynomial U. This suggests (and is justified a posteriori) that the variables related to the elliptic curve introduced in the previous section are convenient variables to express the result of the two-loop sunrise integral. At order ε1 and beyond the two-loop sunrise integral depends on both graph polynomials F and U. Still, it is convenient to keep the variables from the ε0-case.

The sunrise integral has a Taylor expansion in ε:

[formula]

The differential equation given in eq. ([\ref=dgl_D_dim]) reads in D = 2 - 2ε dimensions

[formula]

The Picard-Fuchs operator L2 has the ε-expansion

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

We may view eq. ([\ref=dgl_2_2eps]) as a second-order differential equation for the εj-term S(j)111(2,t), where in the inhomogeneous term in addition to the right-hand side of eq. ([\ref=dgl_2_2eps]) the lower order terms S(j - 1)111(2,t) and S(j - 2)111(2,t) together with the derivative dS(j - 1)111(2,t) / dt appear. It is possible to simplify the differential equation by eliminating L(1)2. This implies the elimination of S(j - 1)111(2,t) and dS(j - 1)111(2,t) / dt. We set

[formula]

The differential equation for S̃111(2 - 2ε,t) reads then

[formula]

[formula] has a Taylor expansions in ε, which we write as

[formula]

In comparison to eq. ([\ref=expansion_2D]) we didn't factor out a prefactor exp ( - 2γε). This is just a convenient convention. In both cases our definitions are such that the Taylor terms S(j)111(2,t) and S̃(j)111(2,t) are free of Euler's constant γ. The differential operator 2 has a Taylor expansions in ε similar to eq. ([\ref=expansion_L2_2D]) and we find

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=dgl_tilde_2_2eps]) is a second-order differential equation for S̃(j)111(2,t), where in the inhomogeneous term in addition to the right-hand side of eq. ([\ref=dgl_tilde_2_2eps]) only the lower order term S̃(j - 2)111(2,t) appears. The terms S̃(j - 1)111(2,t) and dS̃(j - 1)111(2,t) / dt do not appear. We further note that the O(ε0)-part of the Picard-Fuchs operators 2 and L2 agree, in other words we have (0)2 = L(0)2. The differential equation for S̃(j)111(2,t) is therefore

[formula]

with the convention that S̃(j)111(2,t) = 0 for j < 0.

The simple form of the differential equation in eq. ([\ref=dgl_tilde_2_2eps]) and in eq. ([\ref=dgl_transformed]) for S̃111 is the key to the iterative solution. However, we would like to mention that there is a small price to pay: The original function S111(2 - 2ε,t) is regular at t = 0. This is no longer the case for S̃111(2 - 2ε,t), which exhibits logarithmic singularities at t = 0. This is due to the fact that in the definition of S̃111 we split off a prefactor

[formula]

Of course, in the combination of prefactor and S̃111 all logarithmic singularities of ln (t) cancel, leaving a regular result.

Boundary values

For the solution of the differential equation we need the boundary value at t = 0. We have

[formula]

By a change of variables we can relate this integral to the one-loop three-point function in 4 + 2ε space-time dimensions (please note the sign of the ε-part) with massless internal lines and three external masses. The change of variables can be found in [\cite=Adams:2013nia] and the result of the one-loop three point function can be taken from [\cite=Bern:1994kr] [\cite=Lu:1992ny]. One obtains for the ε-expansion of S111(2 - 2ε,0)

[formula]

with

[formula]

The hypergeometric function can be expanded systematically in ε with the methods of [\cite=Moch:2001zr]. The first few terms are given by

[formula]

We obtain for the first few terms of the Taylor expansion

[formula]

We may determine the boundary values for S̃111(2 - 2ε,t) as well. As already mentioned, the function S̃111 has logarithmic singularities at t = 0, which are removed by the prefactor relating S̃111 and S111. It will be convenient to express these logarithms in ln ( - q). We have

[formula]

Explicitly, we have for the lowest terms the asymptotic expansions

[formula]

The class of functions

In this section we present the class of functions needed to express our results. In particular we are interested in the q-dependence of these functions. Let us start from known functions and let us consider first the q-independent functions. Here we have the algebraic functions extended by the multiple logarithms. We recall that the classical polylogarithms are defined by

[formula]

and that the multiple polylogarithms are defined by

[formula]

Let us now turn to the q-dependent functions: In previous publications [\cite=Adams:2014vja] [\cite=Adams:2015gva] we already introduced the following generalisation of the classical polylogarithm depending on three variables x, y, q and two (integer) indices n, m:

[formula]

For the results of this paper we just need one more generalisation, given by

[formula]

In addition we will use the shorthand notation

[formula]

where the vectors [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] have l entries, while the vector [formula] has (l - 1) entries. In this paper the entries of [formula] will always be even numbers and it is therefore convenient to use the convention [formula]. There is no need to include a l-th entry in the vector [formula], the effect of including 2ol can be re-absorbed by nl' = nl + ol and ml' = ml + ol.

The integration algorithm

Let us consider the differential equation

[formula]

where the differential operator L(0)2 is defined in eq. ([\ref=def_L2_expansion]). Let us fix the boundary conditions at the value t0. The full solution can be written as

[formula]

The special solution [formula] satisfies

[formula]

The integration constants are determined from the boundary conditions. The special solution [formula] is given by

[formula]

There are two alternative representations for [formula], which will be useful [\cite=Adams:2014vja]. We have

[formula]

We would like to fix the boundary values at t = 0. However, since S̃111 has logarithmic singularities at t = 0, this is not directly possible. We first consider the boundary values at a small, but finite value t = t0 (or equivalently q = q0) and take the limit t0  →  0 (or equivalently q0  →  0) in the end. Before taking the limit we are allowed to neglect any polynomials in t0 (or q0) and we only need to keep logarithms of t0 (respectively logarithms of q0).

Let us further mention a small technical detail: The homogeneous solutions are spanned by ψ1 and ψ2, defined in eq. ([\ref=def_periods]). For the case at hand it will be convenient to use instead of the basis {ψ1,ψ2} the basis given by

[formula]

in eq. ([\ref=inhomogeneous_solution]).

Now let us specialise to S̃(j)111(2,t). We have

[formula]

with the convention that S̃(j)111(2,t) = 0 for j < 0. The inhomogeneous term splits into two parts

[formula]

with

[formula]

At each order j the inhomogeneous term I(j)a(t) gives a new contribution, while the inhomogeneous term I(j)b(t) yields an iterated integration of an already existing term of lower order.

In the next two sub-sections we will show that the integrations of I(j)a(t) and I(j)b(t) can be done within the class of functions defined in section [\ref=sec:functions].

Integration of I(j)a(t)

We first consider the integration of I(j)a(t):

[formula]

where I(j)a(t) is given in eq. ([\ref=def_I_a_I_b]). The q-expansion of the logarithm is given by

[formula]

Taking the j-th power of eq. ([\ref=q_expansion_logarithm]), we see that the integration is of the form

[formula]

The basic integral is (with [formula], [formula])

[formula]

Each logarithm is always accompanied by a positive power of q. This allows us to take the limit q0  →  0 without any problems. We obtain for k < j

[formula]

In the special case k = j we simply have

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=int_I_a_1]) and eq. ([\ref=int_I_a_2]) show that the integrations related to I(j)a(t) always stay within our class of functions.

Integration of I(j)b(t)

Let us now consider the integration of I(j)b(t):

[formula]

where I(j)b(q) is given in eq. ([\ref=def_I_a_I_b]) and involves the lower-order terms [formula]. The function [formula] contains always a prefactor ψ1  /  π and it is convenient to write

[formula]

Let us define the integration kernel

[formula]

S̃(j,b)111 is then given by

[formula]

The integration kernel has the q-expansion

[formula]

The terms in [formula] are of the form (with [formula] and [formula])

[formula]

including the case l = 0, in which case eq. ([\ref=Etilde_general_form]) reduces to

[formula]

The integration we have to do is given by

[formula]

with p∈{0,1,2,3,4}. Let us first consider the case (p,l)  ≠  (0,0). In this case each logarithm is accompanied by a positive power of q and we may take the limit q0  →  0 without any problems. We obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

This leaves the case (p,l) = (0,0). In this case we have to keep the q0-dependence. The integral is rather simple and we have

[formula]

Again we see that all integrations can be carried out within our class of functions.

At this point a few comments on the ln ( - q)-terms and ln ( - q0)-terms are in order: The ln (q0)-terms from eq. ([\ref=log_terms]) will cancel with the corresponding ln (q0)-terms from the integration constants C1 and C2 appearing in eq. ([\ref=inhomogeneous_solution]). The ln ( - q)-terms remain in the result for S̃(j)111. They are removed by the prefactor of eq. ([\ref=def_Stilde]), once we convert to S(j)111.

Conclusions

In this paper we have shown, that the Laurent expansion around D = 2 - 2ε space-time dimensions of the two-loop sunrise integral with equal non-zero masses can be computed to arbitrary order in the dimensional regularisation parameter ε. We have defined a class of transcendental functions and we have shown that all results can be expressed within this class of functions. The class of functions includes the multiple polylogarithms, which are functions associated to a punctured Riemann surface of genus zero. The new additional functions are associated to an algebraic variety consisting of a punctured Riemann surface of genus one and a punctured Riemann surface of genus zero. We provided an algorithm which allows us to express an arbitrary order of the ε-expansion of the two-loop sunrise integral with equal non-zero masses in terms of these functions. We expect these functions to be useful for other Feynman integrals as well.

Explicit results

In this appendix we give the explicit results for the first three terms of the ε-expansion of S111(2,t). In order to write the results in a compact form we introduce specific linear combinations of the functions defined in section [\ref=sec:functions]. We define a prefactor cn and a sign sn, both depending on an index n by

[formula]

At depth 1 we define the linear combinations

[formula]

More explicitly, we have

[formula]

The functions [formula] can be thought of as elliptic generalisations of the Clausen and Glaisher functions [\cite=Adams:2015gva]. At higher depth we define functions

[formula]

as follows: If o1 = 0 we set

[formula]

For o1  ≠  0 we set

[formula]

The integrals are easily converted to sums. For example we have

[formula]

Certain terms in the result at order εj will be proportional to lower order terms. The factor of proportionality is

[formula]

It is convenient to factor out the homogeneous solution and we write

[formula]

We now present the explicit results for the functions E(j)111(2,q) for j∈{0,1,2}. We have

[formula]

In the expression for E(2)111 we used in addition the abbreviation

[formula]

The function [formula] is symmetric in the four four-tuples (ni,mi,xi,yi) = (0,0,r3,1).
