Fermions in Rotating Reference Frames

Introduction

The quantization of fields in non-Minkowskian metrics can give rise to observable effects, not otherwise present in the flat-space formalism. The most notable examples are Hawking's black-hole evaporation [\cite=Hawking1975] and Fulling-Davies-Unruh's [\cite=Fulling1973][\cite=Davies1975][\cite=Unruh1976] accelerating thermal bath. These semi-classical gravitational and inertial effects occur due to the differing operators that arise when quantizing fields in inequivalent reference frames. Different quantum operators necessarily imply different vacuum states between the two quantisations of the field. Linking the two quantisations via Bogoliubov transformations [\cite=Birrell1984] can give extra contributions to standard flat-space observer expectation values when dealing with fields in non-Minkowskian metrics. Specific examples of these effects can be found in the references [\cite=Kobakhidze2015a][\cite=Kobakhidze2015][\cite=Giovannini2000][\cite=Girdhar2013] and in the reviews [\cite=Birrell1984][\cite=Jacobson:2003vx][\cite=Parker2009].

Due to these effects, it is important to be able to quantize fermionic matter fields in common metrics in order to estimate any deviation to expectation values in standard Minkowskian quantum field theory (QFT) calculations. This manuscript focuses on the case of the non-inertial metric associated with rotation, which can have useful application to calculations involving rotating particles such as in storage rings, synchrotron's and various cosmological and astrophysical scenarios (e.g. [\cite=Dvornikov2014]).

Some specific quantisations for spinor fields in rotating frames have been developed (see for example [\cite=Iyer1982], [\cite=Vilenkin1980], [\cite=Ambrus2014]), however these follow quantisations which have been done in flat-space in cylindrical coordinates ([\cite=Audretsch1996], [\cite=Skarzhinsky1997], [\cite=Balantekin]) where the field quanta represent standing waves composed of radially in-going and out-going components. As a result, the radial current of the field in these quantisations is zero, whether in rotating or flat space. The quantisation is ultimately an artifact of choosing the boundary condition where the field is zero at the origin, which is an ill-defined point in cylindrical coordinates.

This kind of quantisation makes calculations based on free single-particle states difficult. Here, a new quantisation is proposed where the quanta represents a one particle state with definite radial momenta which can be intuitively matched to a single particle in flat Minkowskian space. This quantization applies equally well to flat or rotating spaces in cylindrical coordinates.

The Bogoliubov coefficients are calculated between the rotating and flat space quantisations showing a non-zero β coefficient. We therefore expect this to imply that a flat space particle will be observed as a mixture of particle and anti-particle states in the rotating frame. Naively, we would assume this to give rise to an oscillatory motion (Zitterbewegung [\cite=Kobakhidze2015a]) when estimating the velocity of a Minkowskian one particle state in the rotating frame. Through explicit calculation of the velocity expectation value using the new quantisation, we show that the particle mixing doesn't entail any observable effect in a rotating frame when measuring its velocity.

Standard Quantisation of Fermions in a Rotating Frame

The line element used to specify the rotating frame, which is rotating at a constant angular velocity, ω, relative to an inertial observer is (in cylindrical coordinates)

[formula]

The Dirac equation in a general spacetime can be written as

[formula]

Here Latin indices and Greek indices represent flat and curved space Lorrentz indices respectively and m is the mass of the fermion, ψ. The tetrad eaμ is introduced to allow the Dirac gamma matrices to be written in their flat space representation

[formula]

The spinor affine connection Γμ is contained within the covariant derivative as follows

[formula]

and is determined by the choice of tetrads. For this metric, it is convenient to use the cylindrical tetrad gauge as in [\cite=Iyer1982]. In this gauge, the non-vanishing tetrad components are (lower indices representing rotating coordinates)

[formula]

which give the following non-zero components for the spinor affine connection

[formula]

Thus the Dirac equation in the rotating metric [\eqref=eq:metric] using the cylindrical tetrad gauge [\eqref=eq:tetrad] can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] is the spin operator in the z-direction. It should be noted that a different gauge choice for the tetrad, such as the Cartesian gauge in [\cite=Ambrus2014] will differ from the solutions presented here by a rotation in spinor space. In specifying the solutions to this equation, we fix the spinor structure to be eigenvectors of the following four commuting operators

[formula]

Here Ĵz gives the total angular momentum, which has no spin dependent term (opposed to [\cite=Audretsch1996]), usually associated with total angular momentum, due to the gauge choice of the tetrads. Hence the eigenvalue of this operator is set to be [formula] where l is an integer, corresponding to a half-integer spin fermion. The Ŝz operator gives the spin projection along the z-axis and has eigenvalues

[formula]

with pz being the eigenvalue of the P̂z operator. With these operators specified, using the chiral basis for the gamma matrices and imposing the boundary condition that the field vanishes at r = 0, the solutions of [\eqref=eq:eom] are

[formula]

where the bi-spinor φE,l,pz,s is defined as:

[formula]

where [formula] is the perpendicular momentum, Jl are Bessel functions of the first kind and [formula] is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian and hence the energy as defined in the rotating frame, which is shifted by [formula] compared to a non-rotating observer.

It should be noted that the general solution to [\eqref=eq:eom] also involves Bessel functions of the second kind, which are divergent at origin. The boundary condition imposing the field to vanish at the origin removes these divergent solutions leading to a field that is quantised as standing waves with zero radial current.

The negative energy solutions can be obtained trivially via the charge conjugation operator

[formula]

These states are normalised using the Dirac inner product

[formula]

such that

[formula]

Using these mode functions it is possible to construct the quantum field

[formula]

Here we have simplified the notation by compacting all the quantum numbers to a single index, j  =  {E,θp,pz,s}. We have also introduced the flat space momentum, [formula]. The quantization derived here, is similar to those typically used to quantize fermionic fields in a rotating frame [\cite=Iyer1982][\cite=Vilenkin1980][\cite=Ambrus2014] and in cylindrical coordinates [\cite=Audretsch1996][\cite=Skarzhinsky1997].

The energy of a rotating particle, [formula], which is always positive, allows the quantum number, E, to be negative for certain values of l. This quantum number partly defines operators {âj,j}. In a non-rotating frame, E is necessarily greater than zero. The fact that rotation allows this number to become negative means that for certain values of l, flat space particle operators will behave as anti-particle operators in the rotating frame. This leads to non-zero β Bogoliubov coefficients between rotating and flat space.

Further, the quanta of these fields have specific angular momenta, l, which physically represent a cylindrical standing wave composed of radially out-going and in-going waves with zero radial current. Again, this is a result of choosing the boundary condition of the field vanishing at the origin. This quantisation is inadequate to calculate expectation values of single particle states travelling in a known direction in flat Minkowskian space. For this reason we require a new set of mode functions in order to quantize the field to correctly describe a free single particle state as viewed by a rotating observer. This quantization is given in the following section.

Quantisation of a single particle in a Rotating Reference Frame

In order to find mode functions whose quanta can describe a single particle moving in a fixed direction in the rotating frame we parameterize the momentum of a particle by angle θp in the plane of rotation as follows

[formula]

Then noting the Jacobi-Anger expansion [\cite=Gradshteyn2007]

[formula]

we see that plane wave solutions can be constructed from infinite sums over the angular momenta defining the quanta in the previous quantisation [\eqref=eq:standardquantisation]. In doing this, the boundary condition used in the previous quantisation, ψ(0) = 0, will be modified to ψ(0) = 1, matching that which would be expected from a plane wave solution. We can reconstruct the previous mode functions as infinite sums to replace the angular momentum quantum number, l, with the parameterized transverse momentum angle, θp, in the following way

[formula]

The above mode functions, contain the spinor components

[formula]

where the bi-spinor φÊ,l,pz,s is defined as in [\eqref=eq:bispin]. Here [formula] which now gives an l-dependent form for the radial momentum in [\eqref=eq:bispin], e.g [formula]. The negative energy solutions are again found using the charge conjugation operator in [\eqref=eq:chargec].

This new mode function, which also satisfies the equation of motion [\eqref=eq:eom], has shifted the ω dependence from the exponential phase factor containing Ẽ in [\eqref=eq:sol] to the bi-spinor components [\eqref=eq:bispin] to ensure the mode function remains an eigenvector of the Hamiltonian

[formula]

These mode functions are orthogonal under the Dirac inner product [\eqref=eq:diracprod] with the following normalisation

[formula]

We proceed to quantize the field using the standard canonical quantization procedure. Specifically, we construct the field operator with particles being defined with respect to the rotating energy, E.

[formula]

The following standard equal-time anti-commutator relations have been imposed in promoting the field to an operator in [\eqref=eq:field]

[formula]

These relations imply the following anti-commutators for the Fock space operators

[formula]

with all others vanishing.

Bogoliubov Coefficients

Given the field operator, [\eqref=eq:field], we can calculate the Bogoliubov coefficients (see [\cite=Birrell1984] for a review), which match the operators of the rotating frame's field, Ψ̂R, to that of a Minkowskian observers flat space field, Ψ̂M, via the relations

[formula]

The flat space field, Ψ̂M can be trivially obtained from Ψ̂R by setting ω = 0. These coefficients can be calculated analytically and are found to be

[formula]

It is important to note that with the new quantisation, both the rotating and flat-space fields are quantized with a positive energy quantum number (E > 0). Recalling that [formula], we can see that it is only because of rotation that the energy delta function inside the βj,j' coefficient can be non-zero. This effectively implies that non-inertial gravitational effects give rise to mixing between particle and anti-particle states in rotational reference frames. This is the case in [\cite=Iyer1982] and [\cite=Vilenkin1980], however it is through the above coefficients that we can clearly calculate how the rotation shifts the energy of the rotating observers quanta with respect to the non-inertial Minkowskian observers, allowing to us to calculate expectation values.

With these coefficients known, we can relate operators in the rotating frame, (âj,j) with those of a stationary observer in flat space, denoted with capitals (Âj,B̂j) via the following

[formula]

Through these relations we can map rotating vacua to flat space vacua and vice versa. This enables calculations involving rotating (non-rotating) observers with non-rotating (rotating) particle states. An example of such a calculation is given in the following section.

Free Particle Velocity for a Rotating Observer

In order to estimate the velocity of a particle as seen from a rotating observer we consider the conserved current operator

[formula]

To determine the velocity expectation value of a Minkowskian 1-particle state as observed by a rotating observer, we calculate the following expectation value

[formula]

here we have used the notation :  : to represent normal-ordering with respect to the rotating operators. The |1M,p〉 represents a one-particle Minkowski particle with quantum numbers p  =  {Ep,θp,pz,s} in the Minkowskian Fock space denoted with subscript M's and vacuum |0M〉.

By relating the Minkowski states to rotating states using relations [\eqref=eq:bogrelations], we can write expectation values of the form [\eqref=eq:currentexp] in the following way

[formula]

The vector Oμ  =  {r,rγ0γ1, - rω  +  γ0γ2,rγ0γ3} shows explicitly the individual operators required to calculate the four components of [\eqref=eq:currentexp] for a rotating frame. All the divergent terms (terms containing δ(0)) sum to zero, an artefact from normal ordering the operator in [\eqref=eq:currentexp]. The remaining terms in equation [\eqref=eq:expandedform] can be calculated analytically and represent contributions from positive and negative mode functions due to the non-zero β coefficient. A sample calculation showing this for the J0 current is given in the appendix and all other results are simply stated below.

[formula]

where we have introduced the function

[formula]

We can give an estimate to the velocity of a single-particle as seen by a rotating observer via

[formula]

The estimates of the velocity in the rotating frame, gives

[formula]

which amount to the standard classical expectation values for a rotating observer measuring a single particle state with parameterised momentum, θp. The results show no explicit ω dependence in velocities other than the θ direction, which is expected classically.

Conclusion

Here we have presented a new quantisation for fermionic fields in cylindrical co-ordinates applicable to both flat and rotating metrics. Unlike common quantisations in these coordinates, our quanta have non-zero radial currents, which reduce to the expected radial component of a particle when trivially calculated in Cartesian coordinates. This quantisation relies on a different boundary condition, namely ψ(0) = 1 (opposed to the conventional ψ(0) = 0), which is satisfied by taking an infinite sum over all angular momenta of cylindrical mode functions. This allows each quanta to match to a plane wave solution and therefore intuitively to a free particle solution in Cartesian coordinates.

We have shown the operators of the rotating field exhibit mixing through non-zero Bogoliubov coefficients to those of flat Minkowskian space. Despite this mixing, through explicit calculation, we have shown that there are no observable deviations in the velocity expectation of a particle when observed in a rotating frame. This occurs because the contributions in the expectation value from the β Bogoliubov coefficients sum in such a way that any rotational dependence in the radial velocity expectation is cancelled. The same effect occurs in accelerating frames (see [\cite=Kobakhidze2015a]).

The Bogoliubov coefficients and field operators presented here are general and can be applied to various flat or rotating systems when modelling free or rotating particles in cylindrical coordinates.

Appendix

Here we present the explicit calculation of [\eqref=eq:expandedform] for J0, that is with O  =  r. Substituting the mode functions and Bogoliubov coefficients and performing the integrals, we achieve the following form

[formula]

The ω dependence determines the contribution from each term in [\eqref=eq:expandedform] through the limits in the l summations. For example, in flat space with ω  →  0 we get only a contribution from the first term with a summation going from -    ∞   to ∞  , implying βj,j'  =  0 and hence degeneracy between the rotating and flat space vacua.

In order to simplify [\eqref=eqa:j0raw] we can use the Bessel function relation[\cite=Gradshteyn2007]:

[formula]

and make the substitution l  →   - l, l'  →   - l' to re-write the last term as

[formula]

Using a similar trick we can write the two middle terms as

[formula]

then by redefining l and l' as shifts by 1 to match the limits of the sums, we can write them as

[formula]

In total this allows us to write the four terms as

[formula]

which we can write simply as the double summation

[formula]

Through this calculation we can see the total contributions from each term in [\eqref=eq:expandedform], regardless of ω, will sum up to a double infinite sum just as if we had originally taken ω  →  0. This is the reason we see no observable effect between rotating and inertial frames.
