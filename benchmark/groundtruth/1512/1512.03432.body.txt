Introduction

In the hierarchical formation scenario, large-scale structures in the Universe arise through the successive mergers of increasingly-large dark matter halos. These haloes cannot be observed directly, but their presence can be inferred from the galaxies they contain, assuming light traces mass. Galaxy surveys have therefore been used to measure cosmological parameters [\citep=Eisenstein:2005] [\citep=Percival:2007] [\citep=Blake:2011a] [\citep=Blake:2011b] [\citep=Tinker:2012] [\citep=Mehta:2012] [\citep=Hoshino:2015], and to study galaxy formation and evolution [\citep=Zehavi:2005] [\citep=Zheng:2005] [\citep=Croton:2007] [\citep=Zheng:2007] [\citep=Swanson:2008] [\citep=Simon:2009] [\citep=Tinker:2010] [\citep=Zehavi:2011].

An essential component of the galaxy survey analyses is the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model (e.g., [\citealt=Peacock:2000] [\citealt=Seljak:2000] [\citealt=BerlindWeinberg:2002] [\citealt=CooraySheth:2002]). This model encapsulates the complicated physics of galaxy formation and evolution within a relatively simple framework. HOD describes the mean number of galaxies above a luminosity threshold within a virialised halo of given mass. Under the HOD framework, the number of galaxies populating a halo increases, on average, as a function of halo mass. Galaxies populating a halo are divided into either 'central' or 'satellite' galaxies [\citep=Zheng:2005]. Depending on its mass and evolution history, a halo can host, or be devoid of, either or both types of galaxies (above the chosen luminosity threshold).

Dark matter halos can accrete satellite galaxies and grow in mass through halo-halo mergers. The central (and satellite) galaxies of the newly acquired sub-halos become the satellite galaxies of the dominant halo. In HOD nomenclature, the 'two-halo' term refers to the region of the HOD where the physical separation between galaxies is sufficiently large that the clustering statistic counts pairs of galaxies hosted by separate dark matter halos; whereas the 'one-halo' term, marks the transition point towards the non-linear regime where the clustering statistic counts pairs of galaxies hosted by the same dark-matter halo.

Several methods have been implemented to measure the form of the HOD for a given galaxy type. These include fitting a model to the HOD predicted by galaxy-clustering analyses [\citep=Zheng:2009] [\citep=White:2011] [\citep=Parejko:2013] [\citep=Reid:2014] [\citep=Nuza:2014] [\citep=Guo:2015] [\citep=Miyatake:2015] [\citep=More:2015], measurements of the galaxy conditional luminosity function (e.g., [\citealt=Yang:2003] [\citealt=Cooray:2006] [\citealt=VanDenBosch:2007] [\citealt=Yang:2008]), or by directly counting the number of galaxies within pre-determined dark-matter halos e.g., such as those identified by galaxy cluster/group surveys [\citep=Lin:2004] [\citep=CollisterLahav:2005] [\citep=Ho:2009] [\citep=Capozzi:2012] [\citep=Tinker:2012] [\citep=Hoshino:2015].

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (or BOSS, [\citealt=Eisenstein:2011]) is a spectroscopic survey that has measured redshifts for ≃1.5 million galaxies over an area of ≃10,000 deg2. The primary scientific goal of BOSS is to place constraints on cosmological models by measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature [\citep=PeeblesYu:1970] [\citep=SunyaevZeldovich:1970] [\citep=Doroshkevich:1978]. BOSS also enables other science, for example studies of galaxy evolution and galaxy bias. Using the galaxy-clustering approach, measurements of the HOD of BOSS galaxies have been presented in both [\cite=White:2011] and [\citet=Parejko:2013]. Using the first year of BOSS spectroscopic data, [\citet=White:2011] performed a measurement of the real- and redshift-space clustering of BOSS CMASS-galaxies at [formula], and simultaneously fit an HOD model to these data to predict the mean number of CMASS-galaxies contained within a halo of given mass. A similar analysis, using low-redshift BOSS galaxies, was performed by [\citet=Parejko:2013], in which they predict the HOD of BOSS LOWZ-galaxies at [formula].

In this paper, we test the HOD models of [\cite=White:2011] and [\citet=Parejko:2013] (W11 and P13, respectively hereafter) by directly counting the number of BOSS galaxies in the vicinity of X-ray clusters taken from the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS; [\citealt=Romer:2001]) in the SDSS DR11 BOSS spectroscopic footprint [\citep=Alam:2015]. Our motivation for this project is that the W11 and P13 HOD models have been adopted by many of the subsequent BOSS science analyses, and it is important to check them using an independent technique.

We have chosen X-ray selected clusters for this study because they are more likely to represent gravitationally-bound systems than optically-selected clusters (optical selection is known to be more prone to projection effects, e.g., [\citealt=Collins1995]), and because their centroids are better aligned with the centre of mass. In this investigation, we use cluster-averaged [formula] values as the mass proxy, because these have been shown to be well correlated with mass, e.g., [\citet=Arnaud:2005] [\citet=Vikhlinin:2006]. By comparison, previous studies of the HOD using X-ray clusters (e.g. [\citealt=Lin:2004] [\citealt=Ho:2009]) used X-ray luminosity ([formula]) as a proxy for the halo mass. Whereas, [formula] values can provide a mass proxy with similar reliability to [formula], e.g., [\citet=Stanek:2006] [\citet=Maughan:2007], this is only the case when the emission from the cluster core can be excised, and this is not currently possible for large samples of clusters (although Chandra has sufficient spatial resolution for core excision, it does not have sufficient field of view to produce large samples of serendipitously detected clusters).

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section [\ref=The_data], describes the BOSS galaxy redshift catalogues, and X-ray cluster samples used in the analysis, as well as the methods used to estimate virial masses, virial radii, velocity dispersions, redshifts and X-ray temperatures for the clusters. Section [\ref=Method] presents the HOD measurements. Section [\ref=HODCompIntro], compares those measurements to the W11 and P13 HOD models. Section [\ref=Discussion] discusses the implications of our findings, and possible sources of systematic error. Throughout, we assume a flat ΛCDM cosmology with values Ωm = 0.274, ΩΛ = 0.726 and h = 0.7 (as used in W11 and P13). Co-moving separations are measured in h- 1 Mpc, with H0 = 100h  - 1 Mpc- 1. When we refer to the 'one-halo' regime, we mean halos that could contain satellite galaxies. For the redshifts considered in our analysis, this typically refers to halos of mass [formula] (where M180 is the mass contained in a spherical overdensity Δ180 (ρ /  < ρ  >    =  180) with radius R180, W11, P13).

The data

The data used in this paper is taken from two main sources; the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS; [\citealt=Dawson:2013], Section [\ref=BOSSdata]) and the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS; [\citealt=Romer:2001], Section [\ref=XCSdata]).

BOSS Data

The third phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; [\citealt=York:2000]), termed SDSS-III ([\citealt=Eisenstein:2011]), included four projects: BOSS, SEGUE-2, MARVELS, APOGEE, and SEGUE-2 [\citep=SEGUE:2010] [\citep=MARVELS:2011] [\citep=APOGEE:2013]. Data is obtained using the 2.5-m Sloan telescope [\citep=Gunn:2006] at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico, and the SDSS spectrographs [\citep=Smee:2013]. The study presented here only makes use of BOSS data products [\citep=Bolton:2012] [\citep=Dawson:2013].

BOSS was designed to measure the BAO feature at z  ≤  0.7 to sub 2 per cent accuracy using luminous galaxies with an approximately constant co-moving number density ([formula] Mpc- 3). Galaxies were selected for BOSS spectroscopic observation from u, g, r, i, z imaging data [\citep=Fukugita:1996] [\citep=Gunn:1998] taken from the Eight and Ninth SDSS Data Releases (SDSS DR8, [\citealt=Aihara:2011]; SDSS DR9, [\citealt=Eisenstein:2011]). The galaxy targets were selected using colour and magnitude cuts that track the expected evolution of passively evolving luminous red galaxies (LRGs) with redshift. These evolutionary tracks are based on the population synthesis models of [\citet=Maraston:2009]. Due to the transition of the 4000 Å  break of LRGs between the g and r filters at [formula], two sets of cuts were necessary. This divided the targets into two broad redshift bins; a low-redshift sample (LOWZ; Equation [\ref=Eqn:LOWZ]) spanning the redshift range 0.2  ≤  z  ≤  0.4, and a high-redshift sample (CMASS - for "Constant Mass"; Equation [\ref=Eqn:CMASS]) spanning the redshift range 0.43  ≤  z  ≤  0.7.

where the colours [formula], [formula] and [formula] are given by Equations [\ref=Eqn:ColCut1],[\ref=Eqn:ColCut2], and [\ref=Eqn:ColCut3], respectively.

Compared to the SDSS-I/II spectroscopic survey of LRGs [\citep=Eisenstein:2001], the BOSS colour cuts extend to intrinsically bluer colours and fainter magnitudes. As a result, BOSS targets consist of luminous galaxies, rather than luminous red galaxies. The emphasis is on constant stellar mass rather than on a particular galaxy type; for example, Equation [\ref=Eqn:ColCut2] results in a sample that is effectively volume limited to z  ~  0.6, and approximately stellar mass limited to z = 0.7. These properties have been confirmed by [\citet=Masters:2011] who studied HST images of 240 BOSS targets that lay in the COSMOS survey area. They demonstrate that 23 per cent of the BOSS targets are late-type, star-forming, galaxies. Only by employing an additional, g - i > 2.35, colour cut were [\citet=Masters:2011] able to produce a sub-sample reminiscent of the SDSS I/II-LRG sample, i.e., one containing more than 90 per cent early-type galaxies. Not limiting BOSS targets to a particular colour/morphological type provides a more representative census of the galaxy population within the desired stellar mass range. This feature is important because it has been shown that galaxies of different type cluster differently [\citep=Simon:2009] and BOSS aims to probe luminosity-dependent clustering.

In this study, we draw on the spectroscopic data that were released (SDSS DR11) internally to BOSS collaborators on July 3rd, 2013, i.e., before the public data release in January 2015 (DR12). DR11 and DR12 are described in [\citet=Alam:2015]. DR11 includes spectra obtained through to July 2013 and covers 7,341 deg2 of the sky. By comparison, DR12 contains additional spectra and covers more area (10,400 deg2). Not all of the redshifts included in DR11 were gathered during SDSS-III: some were obtained during earlier (i.e. SDSS-I/II) campaigns, and some were assigned using the close-pair correction technique. With regard to the latter, for the SDSS-III spectrographs [\citep=Smee:2013], fibre collision occurs at angular separations smaller than 62 arcsecs. This is a problem for BOSS because luminous galaxies tend to be strongly clustered on the sky. Therefore, in the event that two galaxies - that have been selected as potential targets for SDSS-III spectroscopy - are within 62 arcsecs of one another, the one that is not allocated a fibre is assigned the spectroscopic redshift of its neighbour (see [\citealt=Dawson:2013] for more information).

Because DR11 did not include a complete spectroscopic census of all of the galaxies selected to be BOSS targets, we use the terms "CMASS-galaxy", "LOWZ-galaxy", and "BOSS-target" in this paper. The BOSS-target sample is the superset, and the CMASS-galaxy and LOWZ-galaxy samples are the subsets with redshift information (spectroscopic or close-pair corrected) in DR11.

XCS data

XCS uses all available data in the XMM-Newton (XMM) public archive to search for galaxy clusters that were detected serendipitously in XMM images. X-ray sources are detected in XMM images using an algorithm based on wavelet transforms (see [\citealt=Lloyd-Davies:2011], henceforth LD11, for details). Sources are then compared to a model of the instrument point spread function to determine if they are extended: XCS uses the signature of X-ray extent to distinguish clusters from more common X-ray sources, such as active galactic nuclei. Optical imaging is used to confirm the identity of the extended sources (most are clusters, but low-redshift galaxies and supernova remnants are also extended in XMM images). Where possible, either a photometric or spectroscopic redshift is determined for the confirmed cluster. For each confirmed cluster with an associated redshift, cluster-averaged X-ray luminosities ([formula]), and cluster-averaged X-ray temperatures ([formula]) are measured using an automated pipeline (LD11).

The majority of the X-ray clusters used in the HOD study described herein were drawn from the first XCS data release (XCS-DR1; [\citealt=Mehrtens:2012], henceforth M12), with the remainder from the "XCS-Ancillary" sample, see below. The optical imaging and spectroscopic campaign described in M12 resulted in 503 optically-confirmed clusters, including 464 with redshifts, and 401 with [formula] estimates. The XCS-DR1 clusters are distributed across the sky and span the redshift and temperature ranges 0.06  <  z  <  1.46 and [formula], respectively. This temperature range corresponds to halo masses of [formula] (see Section [\ref=ClusterMasses]), encompassing mass range of the 'one-halo' term. For our HOD study, we used 121  XCS-DR1 clusters that are located within the spectroscopic BOSS footprint. The footprint has a complex shape, so the MANGLE software [\citep=Swanson:2008] was used to track its angular completeness, using a completeness threshold of 0.8 for a cluster to be included in the spectroscopic footprint. These 121  XCS-DR1 clusters have redshifts and temperatures in the range 0.203   < z < 0.686   and [formula].

The XCS-Ancillary sample includes extended XMM sources that were not included in XCS-DR1 (M12) for one of three reasons: they were associated with the target of the respective XMM image (and hence were not serendipitous detections); they were not included in any of the three XCS-Zoo exercises (used to optically confirm the XCS-DR1 clusters, see Section 4 of M12); or they were detected in XMM images processed in the time elapsed since the publication of M12. Initial redshifts were assigned to these clusters using NED identifications using the method described in Section 4.1 of LD11. These redshifts were refined using the method described in Section [\ref=betterTzs]. For our HOD study, we used 53  XCS-Ancillary clusters that are located within the spectroscopic BOSS footprint. These 53  clusters have redshifts and temperatures in the range 0.207   < z < 0.699   and [formula].

Cluster velocity dispersions, masses, and radii

In order to validate cluster redshifts (see Section [\ref=betterTzs]), and to measure halo occupation numbers (see Section [\ref=Method]), we need to estimate cluster velocity dispersions, masses and radii. For the velocity dispersions, we use the empirical σv  -  TX relation of [\citet=XueWu:2000]. This relation is based on a sample of 145 X-ray groups and clusters with temperatures ranging from 0.1  keV  <  TX  <  10  keV, and is therefore similar to the X-ray temperature range of the clusters in XCS-DR1. Several fits are presented in [\citet=XueWu:2000]; we have chosen to adopt the relation measured via an orthogonal distance regression fit to the whole sample, because this method accounts for uncertainties in both the σv and TX values. The relation is given by σv  =  102.51  ±  0.01T0.61  ±  0.01X (where σv and TX are in units of kms- 1 and keV, respectively).

For the cluster masses, we adopt the prescription in [\citet=Sahlen:2009], which involves fitting the following model to each cluster:

[formula]

where TX,mean(M180) is the mean M-TX relation and Δlog TX represents the scatter of individual clusters about the mean relation.

We parameterize the M-TX relation according to the self-similar prediction [\citep=Kaiser:1986] [\citep=Bryan:1998] [\citep=Voit:2005],

[formula]

where Mvir is the virial mass of the cluster, Δvir(z) the spherical overdensity within the virial radius of the cluster, and E2(z) is the reduced Hubble parameter for our cosmological model,

[formula]

with Ωk  =  1  -  Ωm  -  ΩΛ. In our analysis, we restrict ourselves to a flat universe with Ωk = 0. A is a normalization constant set by requiring

[formula]

at z = 0.05 for an X-ray temperature of 5 keV. Our fiducial cosmological model reproduces the local abundance of galaxy clusters as given by the HIFLUGCS catalogue [\citep=Pierpaoli:2001] [\citep=Reiprich:2002] [\citep=Viana:2003].

Conversions between M180, M500 and Mvir are performed using the standard [\citet=NavarroFrenkWhite:1996] profile prescription by [\cite=Hu:2003] with a halo concentration parameter of c = 5. We have tested the impact of changing the concentration parameter on the mass and radius estimates, and find that the change, compared to c = 5, to the mean value is much less than the one sigma errors, when using either c = 2.5 or c = 10.

We model the scatter Δlog TX as log-normal about the mean M-TX relation, with a standard deviation σlog TX  =  0.1. This model is motivated by observational estimates of the instrinsic scatter (e.g., [\citealt=Arnaud:2005] [\citealt=Vikhlinin:2006] [\citealt=Zhang:2006]) and results from N-body hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., [\citealt=Viana:2003] [\citealt=Borgani:2004] [\citealt=Balogh:2006] [\citealt=Kravtsov:2006]). The likelihood is constructed from the temperature measurement probability distributions, modelled by a split normal distribution:

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula]. Here, T*X is the measured central value of TX, σ+ and σ- the upper and lower 1-σ uncertainties. The likelihood is explored using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC, e.g. [\citealt=Gelman:1992] [\citealt=LewisBridle:2002] [\citealt=Tegmark:2004] [\citealt=Dunkley:2005]) sampling, using M180 and the temperature scatter Δlog TX as free parameters. An uninformative flat prior is placed on M180, and a prior N(0,σlog T) on Δlog T. Approximately 10,000 Markov chain elements are generated for each cluster, for which the distributions have converged.

The cluster radii (R180) are derived parameters in the MCMC procedure, computed by assuming that the cluster mass M180 is contained in a spherical overdensity Δ180 with radius R180. The MCMC procedure thereby produces chain samples of the distributions of R180 values. From these samples, the mean R180 values and their uncertainties are derived.

Cluster redshifts and temperatures

For many clusters in our study we have updated the M12 (XCS-DR1) or NED (XCS-Ancilliary) redshift estimates using BOSS spectroscopy. For this, galaxy redshifts were extracted from the appropriate BOSS spectroscopic redshift catalogue. See Fig. [\ref=SDSSimageCompilation] for examples.

For clusters with spectroscopic redshifts in M12 or NED, we defined a cylinder centred on the XCS centroid. This cylinder had a radius, on the sky, of R180. The cylinder had a depth, along the line of sight, of ±  3σv. (The R180 and σv values were estimated from the TX values using the method described in Section [\ref=ClusterMasses]). Spectroscopic redshifts for the galaxies enclosed by the cylinder were then extracted from the BOSS catalogues. For clusters with only a photometric redshift in M12 or NED, we again defined a cylinder centred on the XCS centroid with a radius of R180, but this time set no bounds along the line of sight.

If more than one BOSS redshift was extracted for a given cylinder, we followed the redshift-gapper method ([\citealt=Halliday:2004]); i.e., we identify the location of the most likely peak in redshift space and determine the mean cluster redshift using all galaxies with redshifts within Δz = 0.015 of that peak.

If no galaxies were extracted for a given cylinder, then the respective cluster was still included the HOD analysis (Section [\ref=Method]) if it had a spectroscopic redshift in M12 or NED. After all, BOSS targets represent only a subset of galaxies, i.e., there will be other cluster members that do not meet the colour and magnitude thresholds described in Section [\ref=BOSSdata]. However, if the cluster only had a photometric redshift in M12 or NED, it was excluded from the HOD analysis. We discuss possible implications of this approach in Section [\ref=Discussion].

After the CMASS- or LOWZ-galaxies were extracted for the respective cluster, the SDSS image was inspected to check the location of the galaxies with respect to the X-ray emission (see Fig. [\ref=SDSSimageCompilation]). This highlighted the fact that the XCS-DR1 spectroscopic redshift of XMMXCS J023346.0-  085048.5 was inaccurate: in M12 it had been based on the observation of a single galaxy that yielded a redshift of z = 0.25. The same galaxy was measured to have a redshift of z = 0.265 by BOSS (the BOSS value was adopted for the cluster). In this case, defining a cylinder based on the M12 redshift did not automatically extract the BOSS redshift for that galaxy.

The resulting changes were small (Δz  <  0.02) when spectroscopically-determined cluster redshifts were used as the input; see Fig. [\ref=BOSSzDR1zComp]. However, as expected, they were larger when photometric redshifts were used as inputs; the changes ranged up to Δz = 0.25, although 90 per cent were less than |Δz = 0.1|; see Fig. [\ref=BOSSzDR1zComp]. The trend visible in the figure - of a systemic underestimate of the photometric redshift with increasing redshift - follows expectations (see discussion in Section 5.3 of M12).

There is a known degeneracy between z and TX in X-ray spectral fitting (e.g. see [\citealt=Liddle:2001]), so we remeasured the TX values once the BOSS determined clusters redshifts were in hand. The method used is as described in ELD11, but using updated XMM calibration and XSPEC (12.8.1g) versions. Specifically, we have fitted the XMM spectra to a WABS×  MEKAL model [\citep=MeweSchrijver:1986], fixing the Hydrogen column density to the [\citet=Dickey:1990] value and the metal abundance to 0.3 times the Solar value.

Using these updated z and TX values, we recalculated cluster masses and radii following the method in Section [\ref=ClusterMasses]. The resulting distribution of cluster mass with redshift for our full cluster sample is shown in Fig. [\ref=Mass_z].

Measurement of the Halo Occupation Number

We have measured the Halo Occupation Number (HON hereafter) for 174  clusters. This includes 74  clusters in the CMASS redshift range ([formula]) and 100  in the LOWZ redshift range ([formula]). Of these, 56 and 18 came from the XCS-DR1 and XCS-Ancillary sample, respectively, for the CMASS sample (65  and 35  respectively, for the LOWZ sample). All of these clusters have spectroscopic redshifts, with almost all determined from BOSS DR11 data (only 2  per cent came from M12 or NED).

We determine the HON values by counting the number of CMASS- or LOWZ-galaxies in the vicinity of the respective cluster centroid. The method is similar to that described above (Section [\ref=betterTzs]) with regard to measuring cluster redshifts using BOSS data, i.e., we extract galaxies from a cylinder, of radius R180, centred on the cluster location and with a depth, along the line of sight, of ±  3σv. The HON values so derived are provided in Column 5 of Table [\ref=XCSClusterTableCMASSsmall].

The HON values for our cluster sample are small (from 0  to 21), therefore it was appropriate to use Poisson uncertainties (taken from [\citealt=Gehrels:1986]) to estimate the associated counting error. Errors on individual BOSS galaxy redshifts will not impact the HON measurements, being Δz  <  0.001, i.e., they are much smaller than the estimated σv values. We have also made the simplifying assumption that the uncertainty on the mean cluster redshift is much smaller than σv. We have checked the sensitivity of the HON to the accuracy of the R180 estimate, by recalculating the HON using both R180 + 1σ and R180 - 1σ (where the 1-σ uncertainties in R180 were calculated using the method described in Section [\ref=ClusterMasses]). For all the clusters, the HON either did not change at all, or changed less than the Poisson uncertainty, so we chose to only quote the latter in Table [\ref=XCSClusterTableCMASSsmall], Column 5.

We present the results of our HON analysis in Table [\ref=XCSClusterTableCMASSsmall]. The column descriptions are as follows:

Comparison to HOD model predictions

Here we compare the HON of CMASS- and LOWZ-galaxies measured within XCS cluster halos (Section [\ref=Method]) to the HOD-model fits of W11 and P13. For convenience we provide the W11 and P13 HOD parameter values in Table [\ref=LitHODValues].

CMASS HOD model comparison

Fig. [\ref=CMASSSpecHOD3] (Left panel), displays the HON of CMASS-galaxies measured for 74  XCS clusters (Section [\ref=Method]). We also show the mean HOD-model fit to CMASS-galaxies measured from the clustering analysis of W11, along with the 1-sigma uncertainty range as given by their MCMC analysis. The data represent the HON measured for each individual cluster and therefore a broad distribution of values relative to the HOD-model (which predicts the mean HON as a function of halo mass). Nevertheless, the data show a good general agreement with the expected mean distribution. Three  XCS clusters are populated by no CMASS-galaxies (made visible by their upper limits), i.e., HON=0. These three  X-ray selected clusters have halo masses in the range [formula]. We discuss the possible implications of there being massive clusters with no CMASS-galaxies in Section [\ref=fossils]. It is also noteworthy that clusters with only a single central galaxy, i.e., HON=1, are observed throughout the sampled mass range, i.e. well into the [formula] mass regime, see Section [\ref=fossils].

Fig. [\ref=CMASSSpecHOD3] (Right panel), presents the mean HON of CMASS-galaxies binned by cluster halo mass. The mass-range covered by each of the five  bins was chosen to contain an approximately equal number of clusters per bin. The blue points represent the XCS-DR1 sample only, whereas the red points represent the XCS-DR1 sample combined with XCS-Ancillary clusters (XCS-DR1+Anc). Both sets of binned points (XCS-DR1 and XCS-DR1+Anc) demonstrate a clear correlation between HON and halo-mass. The uncertainty on each binned point (given by the error on the mean) overlaps with the 1-σ uncertainty range of the HOD-model fit. This behaviour is seen for both the XCS-DR1 sample and the XCS-DR1+Anc sample. The consistency between the BOSS- and XCS-determined CMASS HOD suggests that the HOD-model fit from W11 is an reliable description of the data (Section [\ref=Discussion]).

LOWZ HOD model comparison

Fig. [\ref=LOWZSpecHOD3] (Left panel), presents the HON of LOWZ-galaxies measured within 100  XCS clusters (Section [\ref=Method]). The Right panel, displays the mean HON of LOWZ galaxies binned by cluster halo mass, using the same procedure described in Section [\ref=CMASSComp]. Also shown are the mean HOD-model fit to LOWZ-galaxies located over the Northern Galactic Cap (NGC) taken from P13, and the 1-σ uncertainty range given by their MCMC analysis. Two other (to NGC) fits are presented in P13, one to LOWZ-galaxies located over the Southern Galactic Cap (SGC), and one to a combined sample taken from both hemispheres. As shown in Table [\ref=LitHODValues], the HOD-model fits differ between the three samples. Using a more complete sample than P13 (one taken from DR11), [\citet=Tojeiro:2014] also observe a discrepancy in the number densities and large-scale clustering power between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. They investigated a number of potential systematics that could give rise to these effects, and conclude that the excess number density observed in the SGC is most likely due to offsets in photometric calibration between the two hemispheres. In light of this tension, [\citet=Tojeiro:2014] treat the NGC and SGC samples independently (and combine the clustering results from both to obtain their final BAO measurement). Given these issues, and because best-fit parameters are not provided by P13 for the combined sample, we decided to compare our HON results to the NGC model-fit only, because the NGC sample used by P13 is substantially larger than their SGC sample.

A new HOD-model fit

The HOD-model implemented by W11 and P13 is comprised of five parameters that describe the HOD of central (Equation [\ref=eqn:ncen]) and satellite (Equation [\ref=eqn:nsat]) galaxies within dark matter halos. The sum of these two components produces the mean HOD of all galaxies within a halo of given mass (Equation [\ref=eqn:nall]).

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where Mcut is the minimum mass for a halo to host a galaxy, M1 is the typical mass for haloes to host one satellite, σ is the fractional scatter in Mhalo, k is the threshold mass for satellites and centrals to differ, and α is the mass dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation.

We have explored the appropriateness of the HOD-model fits in W11 and P13 (summarised in Table [\ref=LitHODValues]) by estimating the α-index from our measured cluster HON values. Ideally, we would have estimated all five free parameters in the HOD-model, but our data only span the mass regime pertaining to the 'one-halo' term (Section [\ref=introduction]), and so are primarily sensitive to the satellite galaxy component (i.e., to the α parameter). Therefore, we fixed the other four parameters to best-fit values of W11 and P13 (see Table [\ref=LitHODValues]). To determine the best-fit α-index value, we performed a chi-squared fit, corrected for a Poisson distribution (Equation [\ref=eqn:chisq]),

[formula]

where No is the observed halo occupation number, Ne is the expected halo occupation number estimated from the HOD model, x is the number of data points considered, and p the number of degrees of freedom.

We have examined values for α ranging between 0.1 and 2.0 (in 0.01 steps), deemed to be a realistic representation of the data. Similar to P13, when performing our fit to the LOWZ HOD, we exclude halos that have a HON of zero. The results are shown in Table [\ref=XCSHODValues], where the best-fit α-index values presented correspond to the minimum chi-squared value over the α-index range tested. The 1-σ uncertainty range of the α-index value is also given in Table [\ref=XCSHODValues]. The α values presented in Table [\ref=XCSHODValues] are fully consistent with those from [\citet=White:2011] and [\citet=Parejko:2013] quoted in Table [\ref=LitHODValues]. That said, the measured best-fit α-index values vary depending on the input sample (XCS-DR1 versus XCS-DR1+Anc), and we discuss possible reasons for this result in Section [\ref=Discussion].

Discussion

Our aim in this paper was to examine the HOD-models for BOSS galaxies that have been published by W11 and P13, and used in several subsequent BOSS analyses. Evidence in support of the models is provided in Figs. [\ref=CMASSSpecHOD3] and [\ref=LOWZSpecHOD3], which show our directly measured HON values to be in agreement with the model predictions, and from the slope of our CMASS HON distribution, which is consistent with the value in W11. However, the match between the observations and the models is not perfect. For example, the slope of our LOWZ HON distribution is shallower than the value in P13 when Ancillary clusters are not included in the fit. We discuss this mixed picture below (Section [\ref=disc_ideas]), often drawing on the results of a comparison, photometric redshift based, CMASS HON measurement (Section [\ref=HODPhot]). We end this section with a preliminary study of HON evolution, with comparison to the predictions of [\citet=Saito:2015] (Section [\ref=HODevolv]).

Measurement of the Halo Occupation Number using photometric redshifts

We have performed an additional HOD analysis using photometric redshifts for two reasons: 1) to investigate the robustness of the results in Section [\ref=HODCompIntro], and 2) to determine whether future HON analyses based on photometric data, for example using the Dark Energy Survey (e.g. [\citealt=DES:2014]), will be reliable. For this example, we have used the proprietary photometric redshift catalogue of BOSS-targets in the CMASS redshift range (0.4  <  z  <  0.7) selected from SDSS DR8 imaging described by [\citet=Ross:2011] (an equivalent photometric redshift catalogue is not available for the LOWZ BOSS-targets). The [\citet=Ross:2011] analysis reproduces the CMASS target selection and measures photometric redshifts using ANNz [\citep=Firth:2003] trained on 112,778 BOSS spectra acquired over the first observing semester. In addition to the CMASS colour cuts, [\citet=Ross:2011] implement a seeing (r-band psf-FWHM   <  2 arcsec) and Galactic extinction (E(B - V)  <  0.08) cut, and limit the catalogue to only cover the main SDSS DR8 imaging area. The resulting catalogue comprises 1,065,823 BOSS-targets covering an area of 9,913 deg2, with an estimated contamination rate (from stars and quasars) of 4.1 per cent. Star-galaxy probabilities are also assigned to each BOSS-target via ANNz, whereby a value of 1 indicates a galaxy and a value of 0 indicates a star. The RMS difference between the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of the full training sample is Δzphoto = 0.0586.

The SDSS DR8 footprint used by [\citet=Ross:2011] covers 61  XCS-DR1 and 15  XCS-Ancillary clusters. We have estimated the cluster parameters (σv,TX,M180,R180,zmean) for these clusters as described in Section [\ref=The_data]. We have also calculated the HON of BOSS-targets for these clusters using a similar approach to that adopted in Section [\ref=Method], although, for the association length in the transverse direction, we adopt a typical photometric redshift uncertainty (Δzphoto = 0.0586) for each CMASS-target (zcl  ±  Δzphoto), rather than an estimate for the cluster velocity dispersion. Any given BOSS-target may turn out not to be a galaxy, so we sum the star-galaxy probabilities of each object to generate the HON values.

Given the uncertainty on the photometric redshift estimates, corresponding to co-moving distances ~  10  Mpc, it is necessary to perform an additional background subtraction to remove potential contamination by field galaxies. For this exercise, we estimate the typical number (as a floating point, not integer) of field galaxies falling within each cluster and subtract this estimate from the measured HON. This estimate is based on the projected R180 area of each cluster, and the average number density of CMASS-targets in the photometric redshift catalogue in the range (zcl  ±  Δzphoto). The typical HON correction was less than 1.

To estimate 1-σ uncertainties on the photometric HON values, we have adopted a similar, Monte-Carlo, technique to that used in Section [\ref=Method]. In this case, we only account for uncertainties in the R180 values and hence the projected area for each cluster on the sky (as uncertainties in the transverse direction have already been considered in the statistical background subtraction). The HON are then re-calculated within the derived minimum and maximum R180 to determine the 1-σ range by adding a standard term for Poisson noise in quadrature. The HON values range from 0  to 10.7  and are presented in Table [\ref=XCSClusterTableCMASSsmall] and Fig. [\ref=CMASSPhotHOD1]. Five  clusters with a HOD of zero are indicated by their 1-σ upper limits. Table [\ref=XCSPhotHODValues] presents the result of an HOD-model fit for CMASS-targets similar to that used to derive the Table [\ref=XCSHODValues] values for CMASS-galaxies.

Potential sources of error in our analysis

Incomplete redshift information

Our analysis demonstrate that there are a number of genuine (i.e., confirmed by their X-ray emission) dark matter halos in the DR11 region that contain zero or one CMASS- or LOWZ-galaxies, even at masses approaching [formula]. There are three cases of HON=0 in our CMASS analysis, and one in our LOWZ analysis (4 per cent and 1 per cent of the samples, respectively). There are 21 cases of HON=1 in our CMASS analysis, and 31 in our LOWZ analysis (28 per cent and 31 per cent of the samples, respectively). This upshift could be a reflection of the fact that the BOSS programme was incomplete in DR11, i.e., there are BOSS-targets in those halos, but those had yet to be confirmed in DR11. However, this is unlikely to be the major reason, because our investigation using the photometric redshift data (Section [\ref=HODPhot]) has shown that there are also halos without any BOSS-targets, or with only one.

These halos possibly represent 'Fossil systems', i.e., systems in which the central galaxy has had time to attract and accumulate its former satellites. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that one of these clusters is included in the [\citet=Harrison:2012] fossil system sample (the others fall outside of the [\citet=Harrison:2012] redshift range, and so would not be expected to be included). It is widely accepted that fossil systems have a different evolution history, both in terms of the galaxies and the dark matter, to 'normal' clusters. If genuine, these zero/low HON halos may pose a problem for the BOSS HOD-models, i.e., the model may be over predicting the mean HOD at the high mass end (if there are more massive galaxies than expected from Poisson statistics).

Mismatched redshift range

The analysis presented in W11 was conducted at an early stage of the BOSS survey. It provided an HOD-model fit to CMASS-galaxies obtained during the first-semester of BOSS observations using an early definition of the CMASS-galaxy sample. At that time, the CMASS-galaxy sample was defined to extend over the redshift range 0.4  <  z  <  0.7. However, this range was later modified to extend over the current redshift range of 0.43  <  z  <  0.7, and that definition has been used by all subsequent BOSS analyses to constrain cosmology and investigate galaxy evolution.

In this study, we have used the current definition (0.43  <  z  <  0.7) of CMASS-galaxies to measure the HOD in XCS clusters. Therefore, we have investigated whether this might be artificially producing a good fit to the W11 model by repeating our CMASS analysis using the 0.4  <  z  <  0.7 limits. Doing so yielded an additional 12  clusters for which we could measure HONs. Of these, 7  have an HOD of zero (a much higher proportion than in the z > 0.43 sample). Interestingly, all 7  are matched with LOWZ-targets that were later confirmed with BOSS spectroscopy to have redshifts at z > 0.4. This upshift underlines the need to separate the upper/lower redshift boundaries between LOWZ and CMASS to account for photometric redshift errors. The resulting best-fit α-index values of 0.82 and 0.80 (DR1 and DR1+Anc, respectively) is presented in Table [\ref=XCSHODValuespt4]. These slope values are shallower than the model presented in W11. We speculate that at the transition point between LOWZ and CMASS at [formula], BOSS-targets are being mixed between the samples. To investigate any potential impact of this on the W11 HOD, we have re-made Fig. [\ref=CMASSSpecHOD3] (RIGHT) to include a more recent (to W11) HOD-model for CMASS-galaxies taken from [\citet=Reid:2014] (Figure [\ref=Comp2Reid]) - the [\citet=Reid:2014] study uses the 0.43  <  z  <  0.7 redshift range, and is consistent with both W11 and our HOD. This result suggests that if any galaxy incompleteness is present at 0.4  <  z  <  0.43, it does not significantly impact the shape of the W11 HOD.

Freezing model parameters

In our study, we have only allowed one parameter in the HOD model to vary, the slope α. However, as shown in figure A1 of P13 (where each parameter in the model is varied separately) certain HOD parameters are degenerate to the overall shape of the correlation function. In order to include more free parameters in our fit, we would require more clusters in the HOD study. It is hoped that a forthcoming extension of XCS will provide a sufficient number of clusters to allow for more free parameters, including M1-term (i.e., the minimum halo mass required to host a satellite galaxy).

Use of cluster redshifts from the literature

Not all the clusters in the DR11 footprint contain a BOSS-galaxy within the search volume of a cluster (Section [\ref=Method]). If such clusters had spectroscopic redshifts available from the literature, then they were included in the HOD study; if not, they were removed from the HOD sample. This action introduces a selection bias, because it means all the halos with zero HON values (Section [\ref=zeroHOD]) will be in clusters that have previously (to BOSS) been the subject of spectroscopic observation. The likelihood of a given X-ray cluster having existing spectroscopic data is not mass independent, since higher mass clusters have higher X-ray luminosities (at a given redshift) and higher luminosity clusters are easier to detect in X-ray surveys. It would be worth measuring the spectroscopic redshifts of the clusters excluded from our study to determine how their addition impacts the HOD-model slope.

X-ray based mass determinations

Our analysis relies on an external normalisation for the halo mass-temperature relation based on the low redshift HIFLUGCS catalogue [\citep=Pierpaoli:2001] [\citep=Reiprich:2002] [\citep=Viana:2003]. Not only does this approach require the extrapolation of the normalisation to higher redshifts, it also fails to take into account of the fact that measured X-ray temperature is dependent on the instrument used for the measurement (e.g. [\citealt=Donahue:2014]). Independent mass measurements of the clusters, either from weak lensing or from hydrostatic mass determinations, in our study would be needed to quantify the impact of these issues.

X-ray selection effects

It is possible that an XCS-specific selection bias is resulting in a depressed halo occupation number at the high-mass end. This is because the XCS-DR1 survey covers only a few hundred square degrees in total (albeit scattered across the BOSS footprint), meaning the volume covered at low redshifts is small compared to that of BOSS. Within this volume, many of the high mass clusters will have been the intended target of an XMM observation. As a result they will have been excluded from XCS-DR1 because target clusters are, by construct, not included in our serendipitous sample. There is some qualitative evidence for this effect in our analysis: when ancillary clusters, which are predominately XMM targets, are included, the averaged HONs more closely match the model predictions for the LOWZ-galaxies. In order to quantify these effects, a larger sample of XCS clusters in the BOSS footprint is needed, as is a full parameterisation of the XCS selection function.

Optical selection bias

Another selection bias that might impact our current study arises from the optical confirmation process used in XCS-DR1. This process involved visual checks by collaboration members (at least five members per cluster) to ensure that each XCS extended source coincided with an overdensity of galaxies in optical images. The subjective nature of this process could bias the XCS-DR1 samples towards low mass clusters with higher than average HONs (and vice versa), hence increasing the measured HON compared to the W11 and P13 models.

Redshift evolution in the HON

The recent study of [\citet=Saito:2015] used subhalo abundance matching to model the stellar mass function and redshift-dependent clustering of CMASS-galaxies. Their model predicts a positive evolution in the mean-halo mass of CMASS-galaxies, which they attribute to stellar-mass incompleteness at z > 0.6. At higher redshifts, this effect leads to a decreasing fraction of satellite galaxies within a halo of given mass; and therefore a non-trivial variation in the HOD of CMASS-galaxies with redshift.

We investigate their prediction for a redshift-dependence of the CMASS HOD by dividing the clusters in the CMASS sample into two redshift bins at z = 0.55. For both redshift bins, we calculate the α-term of the CMASS HOD following the method described in Section [\ref=MeanHODcomp]. Our best-fit α-terms are listed in Table [\ref=XCSHODValuesZbins] and provide some evidence for a shallower slope on the CMASS HOD at higher redshifts, albeit with large uncertainties. This result would be expected for a decreasing fraction of satellite galaxies with redshift and lends preliminary support for the claims made in [\citet=Saito:2015].

Conclusions

We have performed a direct measurement of the mean HOD of BOSS galaxies as a function of halo mass, counting the number of spectroscopically confirmed BOSS galaxies (0.2  <  z  <  0.7) in 174  X-ray selected galaxy clusters ([formula]). We have also performed a similar analysis of BOSS-targets (0.43  <  z  <  0.7) in 76  X-ray selected galaxy clusters (there is considerable overlap between the two cluster samples at z > 0.43). This analysis has demonstrated the following:

When using spectroscopic redshifts from BOSS, the shape of the directly measured BOSS HOD function is consistent with the models predicted by the clustering analyses of [\citet=White:2011] and [\citet=Parejko:2013] for the CMASS (0.43  <  z < 0.7) and LOWZ (0.2  <  z  <  0.4) BOSS galaxy samples, respectively.

When other parameters in the HOD model are frozen (to best-fit values of W11 and P13), we measure best-fit slopes of α = 0.91  ±  0.08 and α = 1.27+ 0.03- 0.04 (when XCS-Ancillary clusters are included) for the CMASS and LOWZ HOD, respectively. These values are consistent with the [\citet=White:2011] HOD-model fit for the CMASS sample and with the [\citet=Parejko:2013] HOD-model fit for the LOWZ sample.

The first two conclusions suggest the simple framework of the HOD-model is sufficient to fully describe the small-scale clustering of galaxies within halos at the galaxy-group to galaxy-cluster scale (i.e., the one-halo term).

The lower α-value of the LOWZ HOD measured from the XCS-DR-only sample (compared to the XCS-DR1 plus XCS-Anciliary sample) suggests that selection effects in the XCS-DR1 (M12) sample may be a factor, i.e. because high-mass clusters tend to be XMM targets, and hence excluded from XCS-DR1.

When using photometric redshifts that were calculated specifically for BOSS-target galaxies in the CMASS redshift range (within 76  XCS clusters), we find the shape of the directly measured BOSS HOD function, and the measured slope, is consistent with the models predicted by the clustering analyses of [\citet=White:2011].

In both the spectroscopic and the photometric analysis there are examples of massive halos (where the masses are determined from their X-ray properties) that contain either one or zero BOSS-galaxies.

Conclusions 5 and 6 suggest that redshift incompleteness in the SDSS-DR11 sample is not the reason why some massive (including [formula]) halos contain either one or zero BOSS-galaxies.

Conclusion 5 demonstrates that it will be possible to obtain new understanding of the HOD-model using photometric galaxy surveys, such as The Dark Energy Survey.

When the redshift range of the CMASS analysis is changed from 0.43  <  z < 0.7 to 0.4  <  z < 0.7, in direct accordance with the W11 analysis, the slope (α value) does not change significantly. A more recent, to W11, derivation of the CMASS HOD-model [\citep=Reid:2014], was based on the 0.43  <  z < 0.7 redshift range and is similar to both our directly measured HOD and the W11 model.

When the CMASS sample was divided into two redshift bins, the best-fit slope (α value) is shallower at z > 0.55 compared to z < 0.55. This result provides preliminary support to the [\citet=Saito:2015] prediction that there should be a decreasing fraction of satellite galaxies within a halo of given mass.

There are several ways that our study could be improved in future. These include: using SDSS-DR12 (to take advantage of the higher redshift completeness); using the XCS-DR2 cluster sample (this is larger than XCS-DR1 and includes by design those clusters in the XCS-Anciliary samples described herein); including X-ray and optical selection functions to account for biases in the XCS-DR2 sample; expanding the number of free parameters in the HOD-fit; undertaking spectroscopy on a sample of XCS clusters in the BOSS footprint that were excluded from the current study because their redshifts were based on photometry only; and testing the normalisation of the mass estimation technique used for the XCS clusters by measuring masses for a sample of clusters through independent techniques, e.g. weak lensing shear or resolved X-ray spectroscopy.
