On endomorphisms of the Einstein gyrogroup in arbitrary dimension

The Einstein gyrogroup

The n-dimensional Einstein gyrogroup is the open unit ball [formula] in [formula], endowed with the binary operation of velocity addition from the special theory of relativity (with the speed of light taken to be 1):

[formula]

Here (u,v) is the inner product of u and v, and [formula] is the usual Euclidean norm.

Note that [formula] if |u| < 1 and |v| < 1, so [formula] is an algebraic structure. It satisfies certain axioms that make it a gyrogroup [\cite=U]. We shall not need all of the axioms, but let us observe that [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. The operation [formula] is not associative, but [formula] holds for all u and v in [formula].

The Einstein gyrogroup is closely related to hyperbolic geometry. If we think of [formula] as the Cayley-Klein-Beltrami model of hyperbolic n-space, then the map [formula] is an isometry of hyperbolic n-space for any fixed u. When u  ≠  0, this isometry maps the halfline starting at 0 and passing through u (henceforth referred to as halfline 0u) onto its sub-halfline starting at u.

This implies a well-known fact about commutativity in the Einstein gyrogroup:

If u and v are linearly dependent, then they belong to a diameter of the ball [formula]. This diameter represents a line L in hyperbolic space. The L  →  L maps [formula] and [formula] are translations of L, so they commute. Hence, [formula] as claimed.

If u and v are linearly independent, then they span a two-dimensional plane, which intersects [formula] in a disc. This disc represents a hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic isometries preserve angles. Thus, the halfline [formula] forms the same angle with the halfline 0u as 0v does. Hence,

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

If, by way of contradiction, we have [formula], then corresponding sides of the triangles u0v and vwu have equal length, making the two triangles congruent and implying

[formula]

But then the four angles of the quadrilateral u0vw sum to 2π, which is impossible in the hyperbolic plane.

In the Cayley-Klein-Beltrami model, lines of hyperbolic space are represented by chords of the ball [formula]. Thus, x, y, z are collinear in the ordinary sense of Euclidean geometry if and only if they are collinear as points of hyperbolic space.

The map [formula] is an isometry of hyperbolic space, so it preserves collinearity. Thus x, y and z are collinear if and only if 0, [formula] and [formula] are. The claim now follows from Proposition [\ref=comm].

Endomorphisms and automorphisms

An endomorphism of the n-dimensional Einstein gyrogroup is a map [formula] such that

[formula]

for all [formula]. An automorphism is a bijective endomorphism.

Note that any endomorphism f satisfies f(0) = 0. Indeed, [formula], whence [formula]. But [formula] is bijective, so f(0) = 0.

When n = 1, the Einstein gyrogroup is a group. It is isomorphic to the additive group [formula] of real numbers. Endomorphisms of this group have been extensively studied, they go under the name of additive functions. Most of them are non-continuous. Moreover, most of the automorphisms of [formula] are also non-continuous. In fact, the continuous endomorphisms are precisely the linear functions [formula] with fixed [formula], and there are many further automorphisms, let alone endomorphisms.

Henceforth, we assume n  ≥  2.

Orthogonal transformations of [formula] preserve the inner product and therefore the Euclidean norm, so they map [formula] bijectively onto itself and satisfy [\eqref=endo] for all u and v.

Conversely, if f is an automorphism, then so is its inverse f- 1. By Corollary [\ref=kollin], both f and f- 1 map collinear points to collinear points. I.e., f -- as a self-map of hyperbolic space -- maps any line onto a line. In other words, f is a collineation of hyperbolic space. By a well-known result sometimes referred to as the fundamental theorem of hyperbolic geometry [\cite=J] [\cite=LW] [\cite=S] [\cite=Y], any collineation is an isometry for n  ≥  2. So f is an isometry. It is well known that in the Cayley-Klein-Beltrami model, any isometry of hyperbolic n-space fixing 0 is represented by the restriction of an orthogonal transformation.

We now turn to endomorphisms. We urge the reader to solve

Meanwhile, we wish to classify continuous endomorphisms. For n = 3, which is the most relevant to physics, this was done by L. Molnár and D. Virosztek [\cite=MV], while the general case was posed by them as an open problem. Their result relies on a chain of reinterpretations of [formula]. The first step in the chain is an observation of S. Kim [\cite=K]: [formula] is bicontinuously isomorphic to [formula], where [formula] is the set of 2-square regular density matrices and [formula] is [formula] divided by its trace. Molnár and Virosztek show that this in turn is bicontinuously isomorphic to [formula], where [formula] is the set of 2-square positive definite matrices with determinant 1, and [formula]. Then they invoke a result from their previous paper [\cite=MVJordan] and deduce from it the classification of the continuous endomorphisms of [formula].

From Theorem [\ref=aut] of the present paper, using the bicontinuous isomorphisms mentioned above (but in the opposite direction), we infer

Turning to arbitrary dimension, we have

For n = 3, this recovers the classifications of continuous endomorphisms of [formula], [formula] and [formula] given by Molnár and Virosztek in [\cite=MV].

It is clear that orthogonal transformations and the identically zero map are continuous endomorphisms.

Conversely, let f be an arbitrary continuous endomorphism.

If f is injective, then it is an open map, so its image contains a neighbourhood of 0. But this neighbourhood generates [formula] under [formula], and the image of f is closed under [formula], so f must be surjective, i.e., f is an automorphism. The claim now follows from Theorem [\ref=aut].

If f is not injective, then we have a pair u  ≠  v with [formula]. Let [formula], then f(x) = 0 but x  ≠  0. The diameter L passing through x is a subgroup isomorphic to [formula]. We may choose an isomorphism such that x corresponds to 1. It is easy to see that f(y) = 0 for every point of the diameter L that corresponds to a rational number. But then, by continuity, f(y) = 0 for all y on the diameter L. Thus, f is constant on sets of the form [formula] and [formula]. The former sets are lines in hyperbolic n-space, i.e., chords of the ball [formula]. The chord [formula] passes through a and is parallel to L if a is orthogonal to L. The latter sets, when b∉L, are hypercycles in hyperbolic n-space, or half-ellipses in [formula]. The half-ellipse [formula] connects the two ends of its major axis L and passes through b. It follows that f is constant on any two-dimensional open half-disk whose boundary diameter is L. By continuity, f = 0 everywhere.
