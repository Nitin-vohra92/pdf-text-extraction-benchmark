A note on the characterization of finite Blaschke products

The main purpose of this note is to provide a slight generalization of the characterization of finite Blaschke products given in [\cite=Zorb1]. The new result includes a wider range of weights than the original one. The notation and the main methods follow [\cite=Zorb1]. For completeness, we include a short list of definitions and basic concepts used in the statement and in the proof of the result.

Let [formula] be the open unit disk in the complex plane [formula]. For a non-constant analytic function φ that maps the unit disk into itself and for α > 0, let

[formula]

We will say that τφ,α(z) is the local α-hyperbolic distortion of φ at z.

The motivation for this definition comes from the classical hyperbolic case with α = 1. Recall that for [formula], [formula] is the density of the hyperbolic metric on [formula], and that for an analytic, non-constant map [formula], the pull-back of the hyperbolic metric is defined by [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

is the usual local hyperbolic distortion of φ at z. Similarly, for α > 0, we can think of τφ,α(z), the local α-hyperbolic distortion of φ at z, as the pull-back by φ of the α-hyperbolic metric on [formula] with density [formula]. (See, for example, [\cite=BeMi] for further details on these and other related basic notions, results and references).

By the classical Schwarz-Pick lemma, [formula] for all [formula], i.e. every self-map of the unit disk is a hyperbolic contraction. Furthermore, if the equality holds for one [formula], then φ is a disk automorphism, and so the equality must hold for every [formula]. Thus, the maximal possible hyperbolic distortion is attained in the disk only when the map is a disk automorphism. The situation is very different when α  ≠  1. For example, there are analytic self-maps of [formula] for which τφ,α(z) is not even bounded when 0 < α < 1. For more details and further references on this, see [\cite=Zorb1].

In 1986, M. Heins used in [\cite=He] the boundary behaviour of the hyperbolic distortion [formula] to characterize the finite Blaschke products among the class of analytic self-maps of the unit disk.

Theorem A. ([\cite=He]): Let φ be an analytic self-map of [formula]. Then φ is a finite Blaschke product if and only if [formula]

A more recent result of D. Kraus, O. Roth and S. Rucheweyh from 2007 generalized Heins' result to a characterization of analytic boundary behaviour of self-maps of [formula] on subarcs of the unit circle.

Theorem B. ([\cite=KRR]): Let φ be an analytic self-map of [formula] and let Γ be an open subarc of [formula]. Then the following are equivalent:

(a) For every ζ∈Γ, [formula].

(b) For every ζ∈Γ, [formula].

(c) φ has an analytic extension across Γ and [formula].

They also asked questions about possible generalizations of these results in terms of angular, i.e. non-tangential, limits. Recall that for [formula] and γ > 1, the angular (or non-tangential) region Γγ(ζ) in [formula] is defined by

[formula]

If z  →  ζ through the angular region Γγ(ζ), we say that the corresponding limit is an angular limit. This type of limit will be denoted by [formula]. Recall that since an analytic self-map φ of the unit disk is in [formula], it has radial (and angular) limits almost everywhere on the unit circle. We will denote the radial extension function with the same symbol φ.

Moreover, an analytic map [formula] has an [formula] at [formula] if there exists [formula] such that the angular limit

[formula]

exists. In this case the value of the limit is called an angular derivative of φ at ζ, and will be denoted by φ'(ζ). By the Julia-Carathéodory theorem (see [\cite=Sh]), the existence of the angular derivative at ζ is equivalent to

[formula]

with the limit infimum attained in an angular approach to ζ.

In 2013, D. Kraus specified in [\cite=Kr] the class of functions characterized by the existence of (nonzero) angular boundary limits of their hyperbolic distortion a.e. on the unit circle.

Theorem C.([\cite=Kr]): If φ is an analytic self-map of [formula], then [formula] for almost every [formula] if and only if φ is an inner function with finite angular derivatives at almost every point in [formula].

Since there exist infinite Blaschke products with finite angular derivatives a.e. on [formula], the class of functions determined by the last theorem is much larger than the class of finite Blaschke products. Hence, the angular limits boundary condition on the classical hyperbolic distortion [formula] will not determine the class of finite Blaschke products. We were able to show in [\cite=Zorb1] that we can accomplish this if, instead, we use angular limit boundary conditions on τφ,α, with α > 1. The following theorem shows that actually, this result can be generalized to any α  ≠  1. Parts of the proof of the theorem are the same as in [\cite=Zorb1]. We provide some of them here for completeness.

Theorem 1. Let φ be a non-constant self-map of [formula]. Then φ is a finite Blaschke product if and only if there exist α  ≠  1 and c > 0 such that τφ,α is bounded and such that for almost every [formula]

[formula]

If φ is a finite Blaschke product, then τφ,α is bounded for any α > 0 as shown, for example, in [\cite=Zorb1]. Since φ has an analytic extension across the unit circle, and |φ(ζ)| = 1 for all [formula], by the Julia-Carathéodory theorem φ has an angular derivative equal to the regular derivative of φ at ζ. Using again the Julia-Carathéodory theorem characterization of the angular derivative, one gets that

[formula]

If α > 1, since φ' is continuous on [formula], we get that

[formula]

If 0 < α < 1, since by the Schwartz Lemma [formula], we get that

[formula]

For the other direction of the proof, we will show first, by using a similar idea as in the proof of Theorem 2.3 from [\cite=Kr], that if [formula] such that [formula] for almost every [formula], then φ has to be an inner function. Note that 1 - |z|2  →  0 as [formula], and so for almost all ζ in [formula]

[formula]

Thus, if [formula], then [formula]. But by Privalov's Theorem [\cite=Po], this can happen only for ζ in a set of measure zero, i.e. [formula] for almost every [formula], and so φ is inner.

In the case when 0 < α < 1, since φ is inner and τφ,α is bounded, φ must be a finite Blaschke product. This follows, for example, from the fact that then φ has to be in the disk algebra (see [\cite=Du]).

When α > 1, and for almost every [formula]

[formula]

then, since by the Schwarz-Pick Lemma τφ(z)  ≤  1 for every [formula], and since α - 1 > 0, we have that

[formula]

Thus, for almost every ζ in [formula]

[formula]

and so, for almost every ζ in [formula] it must be that

[formula]

Hence, we have that on one hand φ is inner, as shown above, and on the other hand for almost every ζ in [formula] the modulus of the angular derivative at ζ is bounded above by a constant depending only on α and c.

By a result of P. Ahern and D. Clark (see [\cite=AhCl]), for an inner function φ we have that |φ'| is in [formula] if and only if φ' is in [formula]. Furthermore, if [formula], then φ must be a finite Blaschke product. Since in our case |φ'| is almost everywhere bounded by [formula] on [formula], by [\cite=AhCl] we have that φ' belongs to [formula], and so φ must be a finite Blaschke product.

Remark: Note that as a consequence of the theorem, one also gets an interesting result reflecting on the rigidity of the local hyperbolic distortion. Namely, if there exist α  ≠  1 and c > 0 such that τφ,α is bounded and such that for almost every [formula] we have that [formula] then [formula] exists for every ζ in [formula] and equals |φ'(ζ)|1 - α. Also, the proof of the theorem shows that if in the previous statement we replace [formula] by a subset E of positive Lebesque (linear) measure, then [formula] for almost every ζ∈E and the conclusion on the rigidity of τφ,α holds almost everywhere on E.
