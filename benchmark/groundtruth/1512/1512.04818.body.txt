Introduction

KM-arcs

Point sets in [formula], the Desarguesian projective plane of over the finite field [formula] of order q, that have few different intersections sizes with lines have been a research subject throughout the last decades. A point set S of type [formula] in [formula] is a point set such that for every line in [formula] the intersection size [formula] equals ij for some j and such that each value ij occurs as intersection size for some line. In [\cite=mig] point sets of type (0,2,q / 2) of size [formula] were studied. This led to the following generalisation by Korchm�ros and Mazzocca in [\cite=km].

A KM-arc of type t in [formula] is a point set of type (0,2,t) with size q + t. A line containing i of its points is called an i-secant.

Originally these KM-arcs were denoted as (q + t)-arcs of type (0,2,t) [\cite=km] or '(q + t,t)-arcs of type (0,2,t)' [\cite=gw] but in honour of Korchm�ros and Mazzocca we denote them by KM-arcs. The following results were obtained in [\cite=gw] and [\cite=km].

If A is a KM-arc of type t in [formula], 2 < t < q, then

q is even;

t is a divisor of q;

there are [formula] different t-secants to A, and they are concurrent.

If A is a KM-arc of type t, then the point contained in all t-secants to A is called the t-nucleus of A.

A point set S in [formula] is a called a translation set with respect to the line [formula] if the group of elations with axis [formula] fixing S acts transitively on the points of [formula]; the line [formula] is called the translation line. If a KM-arc is a translation set, then it is called a translation KM-arc.

If [formula] is a translation KM-arc of type t with respect to the line [formula], then [formula] is a t-secant to S.

The main questions in the study of the KM-arcs are the following: for which values of q and t does a KM-arc of type t in [formula] exist? and which nonequivalent KM-arcs of type t in [formula] exist for given admissable q and t? We give a survey of the known results in Table [\ref=overviewKMarcs].

In this article we will use linear sets to study these problems. We will describe a new family of KM-arcs of type q / 4, and look at known KM-arcs from this point of view. It was noted a few years ago that KM-arcs together with their t-nucleus determine [formula]-linear sets on each of their t-secants, however they are not [formula]-linear sets themselves. Vandendriessche conjectured in a lecture [\cite=petervicenza] that this is always the case.

In the second half of this section we recall the basic information on field reduction and linear sets. In Section [\ref=sec:translationKMarcs] we discuss translation KM-arcs. We introduce i-clubs and discuss their relationship with KM-arcs. We will prove a characterisation theorem of translation KM-arcs using these i-clubs, discuss KM-arcs of type q / 2 and translation hyperovals from this perspective and describe a family of type q / 4 using this setting. In Section [\ref=sec:revisiting] we will discuss the known KM-arcs from the point of view of linear sets and show that the family of Vandendriessche is a family of translation KM-arcs which can be constructed as in Section [\ref=sec:translationKMarcs]. In Section [\ref=genervdd] we present a new family of KM-arcs of type q / 4, including the family of Vandendriessche as well as many examples of non-translation arcs. We end by showing that every translation KM-arc of type q / 4 is a member of this new family.

Linear sets and field reduction

A (t - 1)-spread S of [formula] is a partition of the point set of [formula] into subspaces of dimension (t - 1). It is a classic result of Segre that a (t - 1)-spread of [formula] can only exist if t divides n. The construction of a Desarguesian spread that follows shows the well-known fact that this condition is also sufficient.

A Desarguesian (t - 1)-spread of [formula] can be obtained by applying field reduction to the points of [formula]. The underlying vector space of the projective space [formula] is V(r,qt); if we consider V(r,qt) as a vector space over [formula], then it has dimension rt, so it defines a [formula]. In this way, every point P of [formula] corresponds to a subspace of [formula] of dimension (t - 1) and it is not hard to see that this set of (t - 1)-spaces forms a spread of [formula], which is called a Desarguesian spread. If U is a subset of [formula], and D a Desarguesian (t - 1)-spread, then we define [formula]. In this paper, we consider the Desarguesian spread D as fixed and we identify the elements of B(U) with their corresponding points of [formula].

Linear sets can be defined in several equivalent ways, but using the terminology introduced here, an [formula]-linear set S of rank h in [formula] is a set of points such that S = B(μ), where μ is an (h - 1)-dimensional subspace of [formula]. The weight of a point P = B(p) of a linear set B(μ) equals [formula]. Following [\cite=michel], a club of rank h is a linear set S of rank h such that one point of S has weight h - 1 and all others have weight 1. We define an i-club of rank h as a linear set C of rank h such that one point, called the head of C has weight i and all others have weight 1. With this definition, a usual club of rank h is an (h - 1)-club. A 1-club is a scattered linear set, which is defined to be a linear set of which all points have weight one. We see that the head of a 1-club is not defined. Note that an [formula]-linear i-club of rank h in [formula] has size [formula]. For more information on field reduction and linear sets, we refer to [\cite=FQ11].

Translation KM-arcs and -clubs

A geometric construction for translation arcs

Let D be the Desarguesian (h - 1)-spread in [formula] corresponding to [formula], let [formula] be the line at infinity of [formula] and let H be the (2h - 1)-space such that [formula]. The points of [formula] that are not on [formula] are the affine points.

Let μ be an (h - 1)-space in H such that B(μ) is an i-club C of rank h with head N in [formula], and let ρ∈D be the spread element such that B(ρ) = N. Let π be an h-space meeting H exactly in μ. Then the point set [formula] together with the points of [formula] forms a translation KM-arc of type 2i in [formula] with axis [formula] and with 2i-nucleus N.

We denote [formula] by A. As π is an h-space that meets H, which is spanned by spread elements, in an (h - 1)-space, a spread element that meets [formula] non-trivially, meets it in a point. Consequently, A has 2h affine points. The size of C  =  B(μ) is [formula], which implies that A contains [formula] points of [formula]. So in total, A has 2h + 2i points.

Let [formula] be a line in [formula] different from [formula], and let L be the (2h - 1)-space in [formula] such that [formula]. If [formula], then L contains the (i - 1)-space [formula]. Since L contains no other points of H than the points of ρ, either [formula] is an i-space, or else [formula] equals the (i - 1)-space [formula]. In the former case [formula], in the latter case [formula] contains no points of A.

If [formula] is a spread element different from ρ, then L meets μ in a point or [formula]. In the former case [formula] has no point in common with [formula], and L meets meet π in a line or a point, so [formula] equals 0 or 2. In the latter case [formula] has one point in common with [formula], and L meets meet π in a point by the Grassmann identity, so [formula] equals 1. Consequently, all lines meet A in 0, 2 or 2i points, and all lines that meet it in 2i points, pass through N; A is a KM-arc of type 2i with 2i-nucleus N.

We now prove that A is a translation KM-arc with axis [formula]. Let P1 and P2 be two points of [formula], and let [formula] be the points such that B(Q1) = P1 and B(Q2) = P2. We consider the elation γ in the (2h)-space [formula] with axis H, that maps Q1 on Q2. This elation induces an elation [formula] of [formula] with axis [formula]. Note that π is fixed by γ, and hence B(π) is fixed by [formula]. So A is fixed by [formula]. Since Qγ1 = Q2, [formula].

Every translation KM-arc of type 2i in [formula] can be constructed as in Theorem [\ref=translation].

From [\cite=km], we know that if A is a translation KM-arc of type t in [formula] with translation line Z = 0, and (0,1,0) as t-nucleus, then the affine points of A can be written as (f(t),t,1) where [formula] with [formula].

Now let [formula] be a normal basis for [formula] over [formula] and consider field reduction with respect to this basis, i.e. we let the vector (u,v,w) of [formula] correspond to the vector [formula] of [formula], where [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Write [formula], and let [formula] be an index for which ak = 1. Let [formula], then [formula], where the indices are taken modulo h. We see that [formula], again with the indices taken modulo h.

This implies that every point (f(t),t,1), [formula] is defined by a vector of [formula] corresponding to a point of [formula] that belongs to the h-dimensional subspace π defined by the 2h - 1 equations:

[formula]

The intersection of π with the (2h - 1)-space H corresponding to the line z = 0, defined by [formula] satisfies one extra equation, namely X2h + k = 0, hence, π meets H in an (h - 1)-dimensional space μ.

Since f is an [formula]-linear map, the set of directions determined by the set [formula] equals [formula].

If A is a KM-arc with affine part A' then it is clear that the set of points of the KM-arc of type 2i on the line at infinity is exactly the set of non-determined directions by A'. The size of this set is 2i, which shows that the set A' determines 2h - 2i + 1 directions and that |B(μ)| = 2h - 2i + 1. Since we know that the point (0,1,0) lies on all 2i-secants to the affine part of A, determined by [formula], we obtain that the spread element corresponding to (0,1,0) meets μ in an (i - 1)-space. Consequently, all other spread elements that meet μ, meet it in a point, and B(μ) is an i-club.

The case and projective triads

A projective triad T of side n in [formula] is a set of 3n - 2 points, n on each of 3 concurrent lines [formula], with [formula] such that a line through a point R0  ≠  P of T on [formula] and R1  ≠  P of T on [formula] meets [formula] in a point R2 of T.

All [formula]-linear (h - 1)-clubs of rank h in [formula] are [formula]-equivalent to the set [formula], [formula], where Tr denotes the trace function from [formula] to [formula].

A set of points skew from (0,1), defined by qh - 1 vectors, can be written as (x,f(x)), [formula] since all these points have a different first coordinate. This implies that every [formula]-linear set of rank h skew from (0,1) can be written as [formula] where f is an [formula]-linear map. Clearly, every (h - 1)-club is [formula]-equivalent to an (h - 1)-club S' of rank h that has head (1,0) and is skew from (0,1). The spread element corresponding to (1,0) consists of all projective points corresponding to vectors of the form (x,0), [formula] and all hyperplanes of this h-dimensional subvector space are given by the points (x,0) where Tr(αx) = 0 for some [formula] (see [\cite=lidl]). The element of [formula] induced by the matrix [formula] maps the point set [formula], [formula] onto [formula], [formula] which proves the statement.

If μ and μ' are subspaces of dimension h - 1 in [formula] such that B(μ) = B(μ') and such that [formula] is a hyperplane of some spread element, then μ  =  μ'.

Suppose to the contrary that μ  ≠  μ' and let π be the h-space 〈μ,μ'〉. Since B(μ) = B(μ'), the qh - 1 spread elements of B(μ), different from [formula] meet π in a line. Moreover, by counting, we see that every point of π, not in [formula] lies on such a spread element. But there are qh spread elements different from [formula], each meeting π in a point or in a line, a contradiction.

There are [formula] different [formula]-linear (h - 1)-clubs of rank h with a fixed head in [formula], h > 2; there are q(q2h - 1) / (q - 1) different [formula]-linear (h - 1)-clubs of rank h in [formula], h > 2.

Note that the restriction h > 2 is necessary, since for h = 2 an (h - 1)-clubs of rank h is a scattered set and the head of a scattered set is not defined.

There are (qh + 1) choices for the head of the (h - 1)-club. For a fixed head, we may fix a hyperplane μ of the spread element ρ corresponding to it since the elementwise stabiliser of the Desarguesian spread acts transitively on the hyperplanes of one spread element. By the previous lemma, we have that every (h - 1)-space through μ different from ρ gives rise to another (h - 1)-club with head B(ρ). We know that there are [formula] such (h - 1)-spaces. This gives in total [formula] different [formula]-linear (h - 1)-clubs of rank h in [formula].

The stabiliser of an [formula]-linear (h - 1)-club in [formula], h > 2, in [formula], q = pt, p prime, has size htqh - 1(q - 1).

We will characterise KM-arcs of type q / 2 by showing that all projective triads are [formula]-linear sets. For this, we need the following lemma by Vandendriessche.

On 3 fixed concurrent lines in [formula], q even, there are 4q - 4 projective triads.

On 3 fixed concurrent lines of [formula], q = 2h, there are 4q - 4 [formula]-linear triads.

Fix 3 concurrent lines, [formula], with [formula] and consider two points [formula] and [formula]. The point [formula] is denoted by R3. Let Si be the spread element in [formula] corresponding to Ri, i = 1,2,3, and let ρ be the spread element corresponding to N. If μ is an h-space determining (via the construction given in Theorem [\ref=translation]) an [formula]-linear triad with nucleus N and containing R1 and R2, then clearly, μ meets ρ in an (h - 2)-space and contains a transversal line to the regulus through S1,S2,S3. If B(μ) is a triad through R1, we may always choose μ in such a way that it contains a fixed point Q of S1. If B(μ) contains R2 as well, we see that if μ contains Q, it contains the unique transversal line [formula] through Q to the regulus through S1,S2,S3. Now there are 2h - 1 hyperplanes of ρ, and each of these hyperplanes defines together with [formula] a different h-space. It is clear from Lemma [\ref=vers] that the defined triads are also different. If we now count triples [formula], we find that 2h.2h.(2h - 1) = X.2h - 1.2h - 1, where X is the number of [formula]-linear triads.

From the previous 2 lemmas, we immediately get:

All projective triads are [formula]-linear sets.

All projective triads of side q / 2 in, q, q even, are [formula]-equivalent.

Let (X,Y,Z) be coordinates for [formula], let T1 be a projective triad on the concurrent lines [formula], where [formula], [formula], and [formula] and let T2 be a projective triad on the concurrent lines m1,m2,m3. It is clear that there is a collineation φ mapping the lines m1,m2,m3 onto [formula] respectively. Let T2' = φ(T2). From Lemma [\ref=clueq], we get that there is an element [formula] mapping [formula] onto [formula], let [formula] be a 2  ×  2-matrix corresponding to ψ. The 3  ×  3-matrix [formula] defines an element [formula] of [formula] that fixes the points on [formula] and [formula], let T2'' = (T2'). Similarly, we can define an element ξ mapping [formula] onto [formula] and fixing the points of [formula] and [formula]. Since a projective triad is uniquely defined by [formula] and two sets of [formula] points on [formula] respectively, this implies that ξψφ(T2) = T1, and hence T2 and T1 are [formula]-equivalent.

All KM-arcs of type q / 2 in [formula], q even, are [formula]-equivalent to the example with affine points [formula], where Tr denotes the absolute trace function [formula].

Translation hyperovals:

The construction of Theorem [\ref=translation] also works for i = 1. In this case, we start with a 1-club in [formula], i.e. a scattered linear set. The obtained KM-arc is an arc of type 2, which means that it is simply a hyperoval, and since it is a translation set, we obtain a translation hyperoval. The correspondence between translation hyperovals and scattered linear sets was already established in [\cite=glynn].

A family of translation KM-arcs of type in :

We construct an [formula]-linear (h - 2)-club of rank h in [formula], and use Theorem [\ref=translation] and this (h - 2)-club to construct a family of KM-arcs of type q / 4 in [formula], q even. Throughout this section we assume [formula].

The set C  =

[formula]

is an [formula]-linear (h - 2)-club of rank h with head (1,0). Consequently, |C| = qh - 1 + qh - 2 + 1.

The point set C is determined by the [formula]-vector set

[formula]

It is immediate that C is an [formula]-linear set of rank h, as [formula] is an h-dimensional subspace of [formula].

The projective point (1,0) in C arises from every vector in W with th - 1 = th = 0. Together with the zero vector, these form an (h - 2)-dimensional subspace in [formula]. All other projective points in C are represented by q - 1 or by q2 - 1 vectors in W. Assume that a point is represented q2 - 1 times, then we can find [formula] such that

[formula]

with [formula]. Looking at the second coordinate we can see that k = 1 / λ. However, [formula] and [formula] cannot be the same element of [formula]. Hence, all points in C but (1,0) are represented by precisely q - 1 vectors in W, hence by precisely 1 point in the projective space [formula] arising from [formula]. It follows that C is an (h - 2)-club.

The existence of an (h - 2)-club of rank h in [formula] estabilished in Lemma [\ref=lshmin3ruimte], together with Theorem [\ref=translation], yields the following result.

For every h  ≥  3, there exists a translation KM-arc of type 2h - 2 in [formula]. In other words, for even q  ≥  8, there exists a translation set A of size q + q / 4 such that every line meets A in 0, 2 or q / 4 points.

As mentioned before, it has been conjectured by Vandendriessche that the points of a KM-arc on a t-secant, together with the nucleus, form a linear set. Let A be the KM-arc constructed above, with q / 4-nucleus N = B(ρ). By the construction described in Theorem [\ref=translation] we know that [formula] is a linear set for all four q / 4-secants m different from [formula]. In the following lemma, we check that the conjecture also holds for the line at infinity, which is the fifth q / 4-secant to A. The lemma will be of use later in Section [\ref=VDD2], when we will show that this family is equivalent to the family given by Vandendriessche.

Let C be the (h - 2)-club in [formula], q = 2h, given in Lemma [\ref=lshmin3ruimte]. Then the set [formula] is an [formula]-linear set.

Let [formula] be the primitive polynomial of the primitive element [formula] that we used in the description of C, so f(λ) = 0. We look at the set

[formula]

This is clearly an [formula]-linear set of rank h - 1 which contains the projective point (1,0). All other projective points in C' are the points in the above notation with v0 = 1. Now we prove that [formula]. Consider a point in the above set with v0 = 1:

[formula]

The [formula]-scalar multiples of this vector give rise to the same projective point. The only scalar multiples that we need to look at are

[formula]

Using field reduction with respect to the basis [formula] of [formula] over [formula], these correspond to the vectors

[formula]

We can observe that none of these belong to the vector set W from Lemma [\ref=lshmin3ruimte]. The lemma follows.

The known KM-arcs revisited

The arcs of Korchm�ros and Mazzocca

Korchm�ros and Mazzocca constructed a family of KM-arcs of type 2i in [formula], where h - i|h. Let L denote the relative trace function from [formula] to [formula] and let g be an o-polynomial on [formula]. Then the authors show that the point set [formula] is the affine part of a KM-arc of type 2i [\cite=km]. This family contains a subfamily of translation arcs; more precisely, the authors show the following.

The KM-arc with affine points [formula], where L denotes the relative trace function from [formula] to [formula] is a translation arc of type 2i in [formula] if and only if g(x) = x2n with gcd(n,h - i) = 1.

Let A be a translation KM-arc of type 2i in [formula], obtained from the set

[formula]

where gcd(h - i,n) = 1 and L is the relative trace from [formula] to [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=translationinverse], we know that the affine points of A determine an i-club C on the line at infinity. This yields the following.

The translation KM-arcs of type 2i in [formula] constructed by Korchm�ros and Mazzocca can be obtained from the construction of Theorem [\ref=translation] by using the i-club [formula] on the line at infinity, where L denotes the relative trace from [formula] to [formula] and gcd(n,h - i) = 1.

As the existence and construction of [formula]-linear i-clubs in [formula] seems a non-trivial problem, we include a construction extending the example of an i-club obtained via the construction of Korchm�ros and Mazzocca to an [formula]-linear i-club in [formula].

Let h - i | h, i  ≥  1. The point set [formula], where L denotes the relative trace from [formula] to [formula] and gcd (h - i,n) = 1 defines an [formula]-linear i-club of rank h in [formula].

Since L(ax + y)qn = aL(x)qn + L(y)qn for [formula] and [formula], C defines an [formula]-linear set which is clearly of rank h. The point (0,1) is defined by all non-zero vectors (0,t) with L(t)qn = 0, and there are (qi - 1) such vectors. Moreover, if for some [formula] with [formula] the vectors (L(x)qn,x) and (L(y)qn,y) define the same projective point, then, by using that [formula], we obtain that y = λx for some [formula]. But this in turn yields that λqn  =  λ. Since gcd (h - i,n) = 1, this implies that [formula], and hence, that C is an [formula]-linear i-club in [formula].

The arcs of G�cs and Weiner

In the paper [\cite=gw], G�cs and Weiner give a geometric construction of the KM-arcs of type 2i in [formula], h - i | h described by Korchm�ros and Mazzocca (see Section [\ref=kmrevisited]). Furthermore, they were able to extend this idea to a construction of KM-arc of type 2i + 1 in [formula], h - i | h. Finally, they gave a recursive construction, starting from a KM-arc of type 2j in [formula], for a KM-arc of type 2i + j in [formula], h - i | h. It is worth mentioning that the authors end their paper with an algebraic description of the three families.

We now state their geometric construction in a different setting using field reduction.

Let D' be the Desarguesian (s - 1)-spread in [formula] obtained by applying field reduction to the points of [formula]. Let π be a plane of [formula] such that B(π) spans the plane [formula]. Let P be a point of π, and let ρ∈D' be the spread element containing P. Let μ be a hyperplane of ρ, not through P. Let H be a hyperoval in π and let K be the cone with vertex μ and base H, i.e. [formula]. Then [formula] is a KM-arc of type 2rs - r in [formula] if P∈H and of type 2rs - r + 1 if P∉H.

Moreover, if H' is a KM-arc of type 2j in π with 2j-nucleus P , then [formula] is a KM-arc of type 2rs - r + j in [formula].

Let A be the set [formula] and [formula]. A line L of [formula] corresponds to an (2s - 1)-dimensional space [formula] in [formula], spanned by spread elements. First suppose that [formula], then either [formula] meets π in the point P or in a line through the point P. In the first case, L is skew from A and A', in the second, [formula] meets K outside ρ either in one or two (s - 1)-spaces through μ, depending on whether or not P is a point of the hyperoval. This implies that in this case, L meets A in 2i or 2i + 1 points, with i = r(s - 1). As L meets K' outside ρ in 2j points, we see that L meets A' in 2rs - r + j points.

Now suppose that [formula] does not contain ρ. Let ξ be the (s + 1)-space 〈π,ρ〉, then [formula] meets ξ in a line. Since K is a cone with base a hyperoval, a line skew from the vertex meets this cone in 0 or 2 points. Consequently, L contains 0 or 2 points of A. Similarly, K' is a cone with base a KM-arc of type 2j, hence, a line not meeting the subspace spanned by the vertex of the cone and the nucleus of the KM-arc meets K' in 0 or 2 points.

Using the algebraic description provided by the authors of [\cite=gw], we see that if we use a translation hyperoval H in the construction of Lemma [\ref=lemGW], we end up with a translation KM-arc, hence, we know that it corresponds to an i-club. When the point P is contained in H, we find the i-club of Theorem [\ref=kmthm] but when the point P is not contained in H, we can exploit the connection between i-clubs and translation KM-arcs to find an [formula]-linear i-club in [formula] where h - i + 1 | h.

The translation KM-arcs of type 2i, i = rt - r + 1 in [formula], h = rt constructed by Gács and Weiner are [formula]-equivalent to the ones obtained from Theorem [\ref=translation] by using the i-club [formula] in [formula], for some [formula] and gcd (r,n) = 1 where [formula], t > 1 a basis for [formula] over [formula].

Also in this case, we can extend the construction of an i-club in [formula] where h - i + 1 | h to a construction of an i-club in [formula], h - i + 1 | h.

Let [formula], r > 1 be an [formula]-linear map such that [formula] defines a scattered linear set in [formula]. Consider the point set [formula] for some fixed [formula] and [formula], t > 1 a basis for [formula] over [formula].

if f(x) - ax = 0 does not have non-zero sulutions then C defines an [formula]-linear r(t - 1)-club of rank rt in [formula].

if f(x) - ax = 0 does have a non-zero solution, then C defines an [formula]-linear r(t - 1) + 1-club of rank rt in [formula].

Hence, there always exist [formula]-linear i-clubs of rank h in [formula] if h - i | h and if h - i + 1 | h.

It is clear from the definition that C is an [formula]-linear set of rank rt. If f(x) - ax = 0 does not have non-zero solutions, then there are qr(t - 1) - 1 vectors that determine the point (0,1).

If [formula] is a non-zero solution of f(x) - ax = 0, then clearly λx̄ with [formula] is another non-zero solution. If there would be a non-zero solution [formula] to f(x) - ax = 0, with [formula] not an [formula]-multiple of x̄, then this would imply that the point (1,a) contained in the scattered linear set [formula] is defined by x̄ and [formula] which are not [formula]-multiples, a contradiction. The qr(t - 1) values [formula] are different for every choice of x̄, so we find in total qr(t - 1) + 1 - 1 different vectors determining the point (0,1).

Now we prove that all other points of C are determined by a unique vector, up to [formula]-multiples. Suppose that [formula], [formula]. We find that [formula]. This implies that xi' = μxi for [formula] and that f(x0') = μf(x0). This in turn implies that x0' = μx0. Finally, since f defines a scattered linear set, we see that f(μx0') = μf(x0) if and only if [formula].

We still need to prove the final statement. It is clear that we can always choose [formula] in such a way that f(x) - ax = 0 has a non-zero solution and since [formula], we can also choose an [formula] such that f(x) - ax has no non-zero solution. Putting h = rt and i = rt - r + 1 finishes the proof.

The arcs in of Limbupasiriporn and Key, MacDonough and Mavron

In [\cite=lim], Limbupasiriporn constructs KM-arcs of type 8 in [formula]. As these are all translation arcs, by Theorem [\ref=translationinverse] they can be obtained from the construction of Theorem [\ref=translation]. This implies that they correspond to a 3-club of rank 5 in [formula]. By computer, we checked that these 3-clubs are all [formula]-equivalent, which implies the following.

All translation KM-arcs of type 8 in [formula] are [formula]-equivalent to the example from Theorem [\ref=qover4].

Apart from the examples of Vandendriessche, which will be studied in Section [\ref=VDD2], there is one example of a KM-arc in the literature that we did not cover yet, namely, the KM-arc of type 4 in [formula] of Key, MacDonough and Mavron [\cite=kmm], which we now denote by Akmm. Note that the parameters i = 2 and h = 5 of Akmm do not fit in one of the infinite classes we have seen before. The arc Akmm is not a translation arc. We checked by computer that the 4 points on a 4-secant to Akmm, together with the 4-nucleus, do form an [formula]-linear set.

The arcs of Vandendriessche

In [\cite=vdd] the author described a new family of KM-arcs of type q / 4 in [formula]. We start by presenting the construction of these examples.

The KM-arcs A0 and A1 from Construction [\ref=constvdd] are [formula]-equivalent.

The collineation induced by the matrix [formula] takes A0 to A1.

The KM-arcs in [formula] described in [\cite=vdd] thus belong to one orbit of the collineation group [formula].

The example in Construction [\ref=constvdd] is a translation KM-arc.

We consider the KM-arc A0 with the points given in Construction [\ref=constvdd]. Let [formula] be the [formula]-secant of A0 given by λZ = Y. We prove that A0 is translation KM-arc with translation line [formula]. It is sufficient to chech that for each point [formula] the elation φP mapping (0,1,1)∈SC,0 onto P, fixes A0.

Assume P is a point (μ,1,0)∈SA, then φP is given by

[formula]

This elation with center ((λ + 1)μ,λ,1) interchanges the lines Z = 0 and Y = Z, and the lines Y = 0 and λ2Z = Y. It can be calculated that each point of [formula] is mapped onto another point of [formula]. E.g. the point (x,1,0) with xh - 2 = 0 and xh - 3 = 1 is mapped onto the point ((λ + 1)(x + μ),1,1), and

[formula]

hence this is a point of SC,0.

If P is a point (μ,0,1)∈SB, (μ,1,1)∈SC,0, (μ,λ2,1)∈SE,0, then φP is given by

[formula]

respectively. In the calculations to show that each of the points of [formula] is mapped onto a point of [formula], the following equalities are useful:

[formula]

To obtain these equalities, we used the information on the primitive polynomial of λ.

By Theorem [\ref=translationinverse] we know that the points on the translation line [formula] not belonging to the KM-arc A0, including the nucleus, determine an (h - 2)-club of rank h. So, the point set

[formula]

is an (h - 2)-club of rank h.

The (h - 2)-club of rank h on the translation line of the KM-arc A0 of type [formula] given in Construction [\ref=constvdd], consisting of the nucleus and the points not on the KM-arc, is [formula]-equivalent to the (h - 2)-club C of rank h given in Lemma [\ref=lshmin3ruimte].

Let λ be a primitive element of [formula], q = 2h, with minimal polynomial f, such that [formula], with [formula] for all i, as used in Construction [\ref=constvdd].

The set of all points not in the (h - 2)-club of rank h corresponding to A0 is SD,0, and is equivalent to the set [formula]. By adding the point (1,0) we find the linear set

[formula]

which is an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1 with head (1,0). By looking at the collineation induced by [formula], we can see that this linear set is [formula]-equivalent to the linear set

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=newfamilyremaining] and regarding the assumptions on the primive polynomial f, the set [formula] is given by

[formula]

which is also an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1 with head (1,0). This set is [formula]-equivalent to the linear set

[formula]

through the collineation [formula]. It is sufficient to prove that L and L' are [formula]-equivalent to conclude that the (h - 2)-clubs [formula] and C are [formula]-equivalent. We note that the collineation induced by [formula], maps L' onto L, which proves the theorem.

The translation KM-arcs that arise from the (h - 2)-club of rank h described in Section [\ref=newfamily] are thus the KM-arcs that were previously described by Vandendriessche in [\cite=vdd]. However, the description presented in Lemma [\ref=lshmin3ruimte] needs no restrictions on the primitive polynomial of the underlying field [formula] of the projective plane [formula].

A new class of KM-arcs of type

We now introduce two properties of KM-arcs of type [formula], that are satisfied by the KM-arc of Construction [\ref=constvdd].

Let A be a KM-arc of type [formula] in [formula], let N be its nucleus and let [formula] be its five [formula]-secants. Denote [formula] by Si, with [formula], and denote

[formula]

The KM-arc A is said to have property (I) with respect to [formula] if the following requirements are fulfilled.

The sets [formula] are (h - 2)-clubs of rank h - 1, for all [formula].

The following equalities are valid:

[formula]

[formula], [formula] and [formula] are (h - 2)-clubs of rank h - 1 with head N.

[formula], [formula] and [formula].

The KM-arc A is said to have property (II) with respect to [formula] if the following requirements are fulfilled.

The sets [formula] are (h - 2)-clubs of rank h - 1, for all [formula].

The following equalities are valid:

[formula]

[formula], [formula] and [formula] are (h - 1)-clubs of rank h with head N.

[formula].

[formula].

The first requirement in both properties in the previous definition asks that for any partition of the set {S1,S2,S3,S4} in two pairs, these two pairs of point sets determine the same points on [formula]. From the other requirements it follows that [formula] is partitioned into four point sets of size [formula], namely S0, [formula], [formula] and [formula] in case of property (I), and S0, D12, D13 and D14 in case of property (II). So, the properties (I) and (II) look like two flavours of the same property.

A translation KM-arc of type [formula] in [formula], has property (I) with respect to its translation line.

Let A be a translation KM-arc of type [formula] in [formula], with [formula] its translation line. Denote its nucleus by N. Let D be the Desarguesian (h - 1)-spread in [formula] corresponding to [formula], let H be the (2h - 1)-space such that [formula], and let ρ∈D be the spread element such that N = B(ρ). By Theorem [\ref=translationinverse] we know that there is an (h - 1)-space μ  ⊂  H and an h-space π meeting H exactly in μ such that [formula] and [formula]. Moreover [formula] is an (h - 3)-space, and μ meets all other spread elements in either a point or an empty space.

There are four (h - 2)-spaces through σ that are not contained in H. We denote them by σi, [formula]. The point set [formula] is clearly an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1, [formula].

Using the notation from Definition [\ref=starproperty] we see that Di,j equals [formula], [formula].

Consider the quotient geometry of σ in π; this is a Fano plane F in which [formula] is a line [formula]. The (h - 2)-spaces [formula] correspond to the points of F not on [formula]. It is clear that Dij corresponds to the intersection of a line in F with [formula]. This implies that D12  =  D34, D13  =  D24 and D14  =  D23. Moreover, D12, D13 and D14 correspond to the three (h - 2)-spaces through σ in μ. The two other requirements for property (I) follow immediately.

By Lemma [\ref=vddtranslation] we know that the KM-arc of type [formula] given in Construction [\ref=constvdd] is a translation KM-arc, so it has property (I) with respect to its translation line. We show that is has property (II) with respect to another [formula]-secant.

Let [formula] be the KM-arc of type [formula] described in Construction [\ref=constvdd], let N be its nucleus, and let [formula] be the line Z = 0, which is a [formula]-secant of A. Then A has property (II) with respect to [formula].

Note that the line [formula] contains the point set SA. First, it is a direct observation that [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] are (h - 2)-clubs of rank h - 1, given the form in which they are presented. Now, it is a straighforward calculation to see that

[formula]

Another calculation learns that these two point sets are equal. Hereby, we used the information on the primitive polynomial of λ given in Construction [\ref=constvdd]. We denote this point set by DBC|DE. Analogously we find that

[formula]

It is immediate that [formula], [formula] and [formula] are (h - 1)-clubs of rank h.

Now, we look at the equations xh - 2 = 1, xh - 3 + xh - 2 = 0 and xh - 3 = 0. Any two of them are independent, but no element of [formula] can satisfy all three. So, the intersections [formula], [formula] and [formula] have size [formula] and the intersection [formula] is empty. It follows that A0 has property (II) with respect to [formula].

The line [formula] is not necessarily the unique [formula]-secant such that A0 has property (II) with respect to it. E.g. for q = 32, the KM-arc A0 has property (II) with respect to each of the four [formula]-secants, different from the translation line.

We now present an easy to prove lemma on systems of equations with trace functions. We will need this lemma throughout the next theorems.

Let [formula] be the absolute trace function [formula], q even. Let [formula] be m elements of [formula] and let [formula] be elements in [formula]. We consider the system of equations

[formula]

Up to the ordering of the equations, we can assume that [formula] is a basis of the [formula]-subvector space of [formula], generated by [formula]. Let [formula] be such that [formula] for all [formula] and [formula].

If [formula] for all [formula], then this system has [formula] solutions, otherwise is has no solutions.

In particular, the system has [formula] solutions if [formula] is an [formula]-linear independent set.

We now describe a new family of KM-arcs of type [formula] that have property (I) or (II) with respect to one of its [formula]-secants.

Let [formula] be the absolute trace function from [formula] to [formula], q = 2h. Choose [formula] such that [formula] and define

[formula]

Now choose [formula], and define the following sets

[formula]

Then, [formula] is a KM-arc of type [formula] in [formula], and it has property (I) or (II) with respect to Z = 0.

First note that ξ  +  β  +  γ = 1. This observation is useful during the proof.

Clearly the lines [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] each contain [formula] points of A. For A to be a KM-arc it is sufficient to check whether all other lines that contain at least two points of A contain precisely two points of A.

The line [formula] where [formula], with [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] contains a point of both S0 and S1, and contains the points (x + y,1,1), (xγ + y,γ,1) and (x(β + 1) + y,β + 1,1) on [formula] respectively. Now,

[formula]

So, (x + y,1,1),(xγ + y,γ,1),(x(β + 1) + y,β + 1,1)∉A. Analogously, on the line through (x,1,0)∈S0 and (y,1,1)∈S2 the points (x(γ + 1) + y,γ,1) and (xβ + y,β + 1,1) are not contained in S3 and S4, respectively, since

[formula]

On the line through (x,1,0)∈S0 and (y,γ,1)∈S3 the point (x(β  +  γ + 1) + y,β + 1,1) is not contained in S4 since

[formula]

On the line through (x,0,1)∈S1 and (y,1,1)∈S2 the points (x(γ + 1) + yγ,γ,1) and (xβ + y(β + 1),β + 1,1) are not contained in S3 and S4, respectively, since

[formula]

On the line through (x,0,1)∈S1 and (y,γ,1)∈S3 the point [formula] is not contained in S4 since

[formula]

Finally, on the line through (x,1,1)∈S2 and (y,γ,1)∈S3 the point [formula] is not contained in S4 since

[formula]

This finishes the proof that A is a KM-arc of type [formula]. We now show that it has property (I) or (II) with respect to the line [formula]. The first requirement, which is the same for both property (I) and (II), is fulfilled: since it follows directly from the definition that [formula] is an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1. Now, we need to distinguish between two cases.

First we assume that β  =  γ, which is equivalent to αβ2 = 1. Using the notation from Definition [\ref=starproperty], we see that

[formula]

It follows that D12  =  D34, D13  =  D24 and D14  =  D23 since β  =  γ and that [formula], [formula] and [formula] are (h - 2)-clubs of rank h - 1 with head N. So, the second and the third requirement of property (I) are fulfilled. Using αβ2 = 1, we find that

[formula]

and from this observation the final requirement of property (I), namely that [formula] follows. So, in this case A has property (I) with respect to [formula].

Now, we assume that β  ≠  γ. We find

[formula]

We observe that D12  =  D34, D13  =  D24 and D14  =  D23, so the second requirement of property (II) is fulfilled. It is clear that the sets [formula], [formula] and [formula], with N(1,0,0) the nucleus of A, are (h - 1)-clubs of rank h, so also the third requirement is fulfilled. By Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg], the intersections [formula], [formula] and [formula] each contain [formula] points. The final requirement, that [formula] follows from the observation that

[formula]

Recall that the construction of Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction] depends on four parameters [formula] and [formula], [formula]. Therefore, we denote this KM-arc of type [formula] by Aα,β,a,b.

Let [formula], with [formula], and [formula]. The KM-arcs Aα,β,a,b and Aα,β,a',b' are [formula]-equivalent.

Let [formula] be an element such that [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg] we know such an element exists since [formula]. Denote [formula] by k.

Let γ be as in the construction of Aα,β,a,b in Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction]. Now, let ρ be an element in [formula] such that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Such an element exists by Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg] since

[formula]

Now, the collineation induced by the matrix [formula] maps Aα,β,a,b on Aα,β,a',b'. To check that the sets S3 and S4 are indeed mapped onto points of Aα,β,a',b' it is useful to note that

[formula]

Let [formula], with [formula]. The KM-arc Aα,β,0,0 is a translation KM-arc if and only if [formula].

First we prove that this condition on α and β is necessary. We denote the nucleus (1,0,0) of Aα,β,0,0 by N. Assume that the [formula]-secant [formula] is a translation line of Aα,β,0,0. Denote the other four [formula]-secants by [formula]. Let [formula] be the group containing all elations of [formula] with axis [formula] that fix Aα,β,0,0. We consider the natural action of G on the set L of lines through N. The elation φ acts trivially on L if and only if N is the center of φ. Let H  ≤  G be the subgroup of elations with center N. If N is not the center of φ, then φ fixes precisely one element of L, namely [formula].

The set [formula] is stabilised by the elements of G since G maps the [formula]-secants necessarily onto each other. We know that an element [formula] cannot have order 3, for if φ3 = 1, then the unique line in [formula] has to be fixed, a contradiction. Consequently, φ4 acts trivially on L for all φ∈G.

Now, we assume that [formula] is the line Z = 0. Let Y = xiZ be the equation of the line [formula]. Any elation φ with axis [formula] is given by a matrix [formula], with [formula]. If φ∈G, then w4 = 1  ⇔  w = 1 since [formula] for all [formula]. We can find a φ∈G such that [formula] since [formula] is a translation line. We find that x2 = x1 + v. Moreover, it also follows that [formula] (also [formula] and [formula]). So, x4 = x3 + v. Consequently, x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 0. Applying this to Aα,β,0,0, we find that if Z = 0 is a translation line then

[formula]

Using a collineation in [formula] that stabilises N and that maps [formula] onto the line Z = 0, we can find the necessary conditions for the other [formula]-secants to be the translation line. The lines [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] are translation lines if

[formula]

respectively. This concludes the first part of the proof.

Now, we need to prove that the condition [formula] is sufficient for Aα,β,0,0 to be a translation KM-arc. We show that [formula] is a translation line if [formula]. We consider the point [formula]. It is sufficient to prove that for any point [formula] the unique elation with axis [formula] mapping P onto R fixes Aα,β,0,0.

Any point in [formula] can be written in one of the following ways:

[formula]

It can be calculated that the elations with axis [formula] given by the matrices

[formula]

fix the KM-arc Aα,β,0,0, and map P onto (μ1,0,1), (μ2,1,1), (μ3,β,1) and (μ4,β + 1,1), respectively. Consequently, Z = 0 is a translation line.

The arguments for the other [formula]-secants are analogous.

For a given [formula], q even, we consider the set [formula]. If two of the elements in Θ coincide, then they all coincide, and Θ contains precisely one element. In this case, β3 = 1. So, α  =  β is necessarily contained in the subfield [formula], and hence q must be a square. So, if q is a square, and β is contained in [formula], then there is only one value for α such that Aα,β,0,0 is a translation arc, but in this case it is translation with respect to all of its [formula]-secants. If q is a square, but β is not contained in [formula], or if q is not a square, then there are precisely five values for α such that Aα,β,0,0 is a translation arc. In this case it is a translation arc with respect to only one of its [formula]-secants.

It is not hard to check that [formula], so by choosing different parameters α,β, we may end up with [formula]-equivalent KM-arcs of the form Aα,β,0,0. However, as follows from Theorem [\ref=transliff], not all KM-arcs of the form Aα,β,0,0 are translation KM-arcs, so the family Aα,β,0,0 where α and β vary, certainly contains KM-arcs which are not [formula]-equivalent.

In Theorems [\ref=case1] and [\ref=case2], we will prove that KM-arcs that satisfy property (I) or property (II) arise from the construction of Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction]. Before we give the proof, we intruduce some notation to make a distinction between points of [formula] and points of [formula]. We will denote a point of the latter space by a vector determining this point, using the subscript [formula]. So for a fixed [formula], [formula] is a point of [formula]. Note that [formula] and [formula], with [formula] are different projective subspaces of [formula], but they determine the same (linear) point set in [formula].

Let A be a KM-arc of type [formula] in [formula], with q = 2h. If [formula] is a [formula]-secant of A such that A has property (II) with respect to [formula], then A is [formula]-equivalent to an arc given in Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction] with [formula].

Recall that [formula] is the absolute trace function from [formula] to [formula]. Let N be the nucleus of A. Denote the four [formula]-secants of A different from [formula] by [formula], and denote [formula] by Ai and [formula] by ANi, [formula]. We also use the notations

[formula]

Since A has property (II) we know that D12  =  D34 and that DN12 is an (h - 1)-club of rank h with head N in [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=clueq] we can choose a frame of [formula] such that DN12 is the set [formula], such that (0,0,1)∈A1 and [formula]. It follows that (1,0,0) is the nucleus N of A and that [formula]. As all (h - 1)-clubs of rank h are [formula]-equivalent and as DN13 has head N, there exists an [formula] and an [formula] such that [formula]. Denote [formula]. It follows that the set D13  =  D24 equals [formula]. Now, DN14 is the unique (h - 1)-club of rank h with head N that has [formula] points in common with both D12 and D13, but none with [formula]. Hence, DN14 equals [formula] and consequently D14  =  D23 equals [formula].

Let D be a Desarguesian spread in [formula], let H be the (2h - 1)-space such that [formula], and let ρ∈D be the spread element such that B(ρ) = N.

We define σ as the (2h)-space in [formula] spanned by H and [formula]. Then, there is a unique (h - 2)-space σi  ⊂  σ such that B(σi) = ANi, [formula]. For every [formula], the subspace σi meets ρ in an (h - 3)-space; the existence of these subspaces σi follows from the first condition for KM-arcs of property (II). Let μij be the subspace [formula], for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  4. Then, DNij  =  B(μij), for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  4.

The Desarguesian spread D is fixed, and we have that [formula]. This leaves us the freedom to choose coordinates of [formula] in such a way that [formula]. Now we can find [formula] such that

[formula]

The (h - 2)-space σ1 must necessarily meet ρ in the (h - 3)-space [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg] it follows that [formula]. We know that μ14 must pass through [formula]. Again by Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg], we find the necessary condition that

[formula]

Analogously, we know that [formula], [formula] and [formula] are (h - 3)-spaces in ρ. It follows that [formula], γ(α + 1)  ≠  ε and β(α + 1)  ≠  δ, and moreover

[formula]

Note that the equation [formula] derived from τ4 is redundant.

If the (h - 3)-spaces τi and τj coincide, then [formula] cannot be an (h - 1)-space. Hence, no two of the (h - 3)-spaces [formula] may coincide. Consequently, β  ≠  γ and [formula].

Since the set AN1 contains (0,0,1) and since σ1  ⊂  σ, the subspace σ1 must contain [formula]. Hence, the points of [formula] are the points [formula] and consequently [formula].

Let ρ'∈D be the spread element such that B(ρ') is the point (1,1,1). Then the intersection [formula] only contains one point, namely [formula]. The (h - 2)-space σ2 is contained in [formula] since [formula]. Hence, it is contained in the h-space [formula]. Furthermore, the (h - 2)-space σ2 passes through the (h - 3)-space [formula]. So, there is a [formula] such that [formula]. Note that [formula] since [formula] has to be a point of D12. Denote [formula] by b, then, A2 is given by [formula].

The (h - 2)-space σ3 passes through the (h - 3)-space [formula], and is contained in the h-spaces [formula] and [formula]. So, the points of [formula] are the points given by the following coordinates for both an x and a y in [formula]:

[formula]

Since A3 is not on the lines [formula] or [formula], necessarily [formula]. Thus [formula], and moreover also γ  =  ε + 1. Combining this with previous results [formula], [formula] and [formula], we find

[formula]

Now, as σ3 passes through [formula] we know that the points of [formula] are given by

[formula]

for some [formula]. We find that

[formula]

Hence, d = b + 1 and the points of A3 are given by [formula].

The (h - 2)-space σ4 passes through [formula] and is contained in the h-spaces [formula] and [formula]. We proceed in the same way as for σ3. The points of [formula] are the points given by the following coordinates for both an x and a y in [formula]:

[formula]

Since [formula], necessarily [formula]. Now, as σ4 passes through [formula] we know that the points of [formula] are given by

[formula]

for some [formula]. We find that

[formula]

We conclude that the points of A4 are given by [formula].

The points of [formula] are the [formula] points of [formula] that are not contained in [formula]. Recall that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. So the points of [formula] are the points [formula].

Note that the parameters ξ, γ, δ and ε are written in function of α and β in the following way:

[formula]

The conditions on these parameters that we found during the proof, namely

[formula]

can thus be rewritten as conditions on α and β. We find that α,β∉{0,1}, [formula] and [formula]. So, indeed A is [formula]-equivalent to a KM-arc given in Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction]. In fact, all examples in Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction] are described except the ones with αβ2 = 1. This finishes the proof.

Let A be a KM-arc of type [formula] in [formula], with q = 2h. If [formula] is a [formula]-secant of A such that A has property (I) with respect to [formula], then A is [formula]-equivalent to an arc given in Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction] with αβ2 = 1, and hence, is a translation arc with translation line [formula].

Recall that [formula] is the absolute trace function from [formula] to [formula]. Let N be the nucleus of A. Denote the four [formula]-secants of A different from [formula] by [formula], and denote [formula] by Ai and [formula] by ANi, [formula]. We also use the notations

[formula]

Since A has property (I) we know that D12  =  D34 and that DN12 is an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1 with head N in [formula]. Then we can find two (h - 1)-clubs of rank h with head N, say C and C', such that [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=clueq] we can choose a frame of [formula] such that C is the set [formula] and such that (0,0,1)∈A1. It follows that N = (1,0,0). By Theorem [\ref=clueq] all (h - 1)-clubs of rank h are equivalent, so C' is given by [formula] for some [formula] and some [formula]. Denote [formula]. Hence, D12 is given by [formula].

Now, let D be a Desarguesian spread in [formula], let H be the (2h - 1)-space such that [formula], and let ρ∈D be the spread element such that B(ρ) = N.

We define σ as the (2h)-space in [formula] spanned by H and [formula]. Then there is a unique (h - 2)-space σi  ⊂  σ such that B(σi) = ANi, [formula]. For every [formula], the subspace σi meets ρ in an (h - 3)-space; the existence of these subspaces σi follows from the first condition for KM-arcs of property (I). Let μij be the subspace [formula], for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  4. Then, DNij  =  B(μij), for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  4 and μij  ⊂  H is an (h - 2)-space meeting ρ in an (h - 3) space, [formula]. However, [formula] must contain the (h - 3)-spaces [formula] and [formula], so necessarily [formula]. We find that there is an (h - 3)-space τ  ⊂  ρ such that [formula] for [formula], and such that [formula] for [formula].

Let μ and μ' be the two (h - 1)-spaces in H such that [formula] and such that B(μ) = C and B(μ') = C'. Now, after having fixed the spread D, we still can choose coordinates for H in such a way that [formula]. Then, the space μ' is given by [formula]. Hence, the points of [formula] are given by [formula], and τ is given by [formula].

The (h - 2)-space σ1 is the space [formula], and hence the points of A1 are given by [formula]. The subspace σ2 is the unique (h - 2)-space through τ in the (h - 1)-space [formula], different from μ12 and σ1. It follows immediately that [formula].

For all (h - 2)-spaces in H meeting ρ in the (h - 3)-space τ the points of this space outside τ are given by [formula] for a [formula] and [formula]. So, there exist [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. It follows that the points of [formula] are the points [formula] and thus [formula]. Analogously, [formula] and [formula]. Necessarily, [formula].

We consider a line passing through an arbitrary point of A1 and an arbitrary point of A2, the line [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. This line cannot contain a point of A3 since A is a KM-arc. Hence, the point [formula] is not a point of A3. So, [formula] or [formula]. Analogously, considering A4 we find that [formula] or [formula] Consequently, in general the systems of equations

[formula]

cannot have a solution. We express that this systems of equations cannot have a solution, using Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg]. We find that [formula] and for each of these choices for η or θ there is a corresponding relation on d3 or d'3, or on d4 or d'4, respectively.

Claim: we claim that two different (h - 2)-spaces in H meeting ρ in τ cannot give rise to the same linear set in B(H) unless β2  +  β + 1 = 0. We look at two arbitrary (h - 2)-spaces ν1 and ν2 in H meeting ρ in τ, whose points outside τ are given by [formula] and [formula], respectively. The sets [formula] and [formula] are given by [formula] and [formula], respectively. By Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg] the sets B(ν1) and B(ν2) are equal if and only if either (ζ1,e1,e'1) = (ζ2,e2,e'2) or else β2  +  β + 1 = 0 and (ζ1,e1,e'1)∈{(βζ2,e'2,e2 + e'2),((β + 1)ζ2,e2 + e'2,e2)}. In the first case we find ν1  =  ν2. We conclude that if different ν1 and ν2 determine the same linear set on [formula] then β2  +  β + 1 = 0. We note that such an element β only can exist if [formula] is a subfield of [formula], equivalently if h is even. This finishes the proof of the claim.

We consider the (h - 2)-space [formula], which is given by [formula]. Now, we distinguish between two cases. First, we assume that μ12  ≠  μ34. On the one hand, since B(μ12) = B(μ34), we must have by our claim that β2  +  β + 1 = 0 and η  +  θ∈{β,β + 1} as [formula] is given by [formula]. On the other hand [formula] as solutions of the system of equations in [\eqref=eq1]. These two results contradict each other, since it follows from η,θ∈{β,β + 1} that η  +  θ∈{0,1}.

So, secondly we assume that μ12  =  μ34 and hence θ  =  η + 1 and (d4,d'4) = (d3 + 1,d'3 + b). We expressed before that the systems of equations in [\eqref=eq1] do not have a solution, and so we find that {η,θ} equals {β,β + 1}, [formula] or [formula], and for each of these solutions there is a corresponding relation on d3 or d'3. As η en θ are interchangeable we can choose [formula]. We distinguish between these three cases.

If η  =  β, then expressing that the system of equations [\eqref=eq1] does not have a solution and using Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg], it follows that b = d3 + 1. We define a = d'3 + 1 and we find, using (d4,d4') = (d3 + 1,d3' + b)

[formula]

If [formula], then from Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg] it follows that d'3 = 0. Again using (d4,d4') = (d3 + 1,d3' + b), we find

[formula]

Using the transformation matrices [formula] with (κ1,κ2) = (1,β) if d3 = 1, with (κ1,κ2) = (β,1) if b = 1, and with [formula] if b = d3, and setting (β',a',b') = (β,b + 1,0), [formula] and [formula] respectively, we find that the sets Ai, [formula], are [formula]-equivalent to

[formula]

We find the same sets as in [\eqref=eq2] with the parameters (a,b) replaced by (a',b').

If [formula], then from Lemma [\ref=tracesysteemalg] it follows that d'3 = d3. Again using (d4,d4') = (d3 + 1,d3' + b), we find

[formula]

Using the transformation matrices [formula] with (κ1,κ2) = (1,β + 1) if d3 = 1, with [formula] if d3 = b + 1, and with (κ1,κ2) = (β + 1,1) if b = 0, and setting (β',a',b') = (β,b,1), [formula] and [formula] respectively, we find that these sets are [formula]-equivalent to

[formula]

We find the same sets as in [\eqref=eq2] with the parameters (a,b) replaced by (a',b').

So, in all three cases we may assume A1, A2, A3 and A4 are given by descriptions given in [\eqref=eq2]. Now, the sets Dij are given by:

[formula]

The set [formula] is the set of points on [formula], not in [formula]. By the previous [formula] is the set [formula]. So, A is [formula]-equivalent to a KM-arc given in Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction], namely with [formula], and consequently γ  =  β. This finishes the proof in case A has property (I).

By combining Lemma [\ref=translationprop1], Lemma [\ref=vddtranslation] and Theorem [\ref=case2] we obtain the following corollary.

A KM-arc A of type q / 4 is a translation arc with translation line [formula] if and only if A satifies Property (I) with respect to [formula]. All translation KM-arcs in [formula] of type [formula], including the example of Vandendriessche, can be obtained from Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction].

We now exploit the link between (h - 2)-clubs of rank h in [formula], q = 2h, and translation KM-arcs of type q / 4 to obtain a classification of (h - 2)-clubs of rank h.

Let C be an (h - 2)-club of rank h with head N contained in the line [formula], q = 2h. Then the set [formula] together with the head N is an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1. Moreover, C is equivalent to the set of points [formula] for some [formula] and [formula].

If C is an (h - 2)-club of rank h in [formula], q = 2h, then by Theorem [\ref=translation], C defines a translation KM-arc A of type q / 4 with translation line [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=case2], A is [formula]-equivalent to a KM-arc obtained by the construction of Theorem [\ref=ourconstruction] with [formula]. This implies that [formula] for some [formula] and [formula], which forms together with the point N with coordinates (1,0) an (h - 2)-club of rank h - 1.

The set [formula] is precisely the complement of the set C. Hence, we can describe C as the set of points [formula], for some [formula] and [formula], where we have used that every element of [formula] is a square.
