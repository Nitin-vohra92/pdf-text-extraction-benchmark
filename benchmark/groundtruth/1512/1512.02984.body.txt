A Constructive Finite Field Method for Scattering Points on the Surface of d-Dimensional Spheres

Introduction

In this exploratory article, we present a constructive method for scattering points on the surface of d dimensional spheres which we believe is new and of interest. Indeed, the problem of uniformly distributing points on spheres is an interesting and difficult problem with vast applications in fields as diverse as crystallography, approximation theory, computational complexity, molecular structure, and electrostatics. We refer the interested reader to [\cite=ABG], [\cite=BBP], [\cite=CS], [\cite=DT], [\cite=EH], [\cite=GraTic], [\cite=KM], [\cite=KS1], [\cite=RSZ], [\cite=RSZ1] and the many references cited therein for a comprehensive account of this fascinating subject.

Let d  ≥  1 be an integer and Sd the d-dimensional unit sphere given by the set of all real solutions to the equation

[formula]

In two dimensions (d = 1) the problem is easily reduced to uniformly distributing N points on a circle and the vertices of the regular N-gon provide an obvious answer. For d  ≥  2 the problem becomes much more difficult; in fact, there are numerous criteria for uniformity, resulting in different optimal configurations, see [\cite=HS].

In this article, we will describe a constructive method to scatter points on the surface of Sd using finite fields. After describing our construction, we will apply it to two measures of uniformity on Sd, namely spherical t-designs and generalized s energy.

Finite Field Construction

For an odd prime p, let Fp denote the finite field of integers modulo p. Consider the quadratic form given by (1.1) over Fp. The number N = N(d,p) of solutions of this form is well known and is given by

[formula]

where η is the quadratic character defined on Fp by η(0) = 0, η(a) = 1 if a is a square in Fp, and η(a) =  - 1 if a is a non-square in Fp, see [\cite=LN].

Given a solution vector

[formula]

we may assume without loss of generality that the points xi are scaled so that they are centered around the origin and are contained in the set

[formula]

More precisely, if xi∈X, define Then wi∈{ - (p - 1) / 2,...,(p - 1) / 2} and the scaled vector

[formula]

solves (1.1) if and only if X solves (1.1).

Denoting by ||;|| the usual Euclidean metric, we multiply each solution vector W by [formula]. Clearly each of these normalized points is now on the surface of the unit sphere Sd. Use of the finite field Fp for larger primes p provides a method to increase the number N of points that are placed on the surface of Sd for any fixed d  ≥  1. For increasing values of p, we obtain an increasing number N  =  O(pd) of points scattered on the surface of the unit sphere Sd; in particular, as p  →    ∞   through all odd primes, it is clear that N  →    ∞  . For each prime p and integer d  ≥  1, we will henceforth denote the set of points arising from our finite field construction by X = X(d,p).

Let us now describe the point set X produced by the finite field construction and provide some explicit examples for small values of p and d. In each case, we may start with a well chosen set V = V(d,p) of vectors. Then, in order to construct the full set of points X(d,p), we need to consider all points obtained from V by taking ±  1 times the entry in each coordinate, and by permuting the coordinates of each vector, in all possible ways. For small values of d and p, this construction is summarized in the following table.

[formula]

Observe that for p = 3,5,7 and d = 1, our construction gives the optimal solution, namely the the vertices of the regular N-gon. This, however, is not the case for p > 7.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will discuss spherical t-designs. More precisely, we will prove that for any d  ≥  2 and any odd prime p, our set of points forms a spherical 3-design. Moreover, given any odd positive integer k, our set of points forms a spherical design of index k. Section 3 introduces the notion of generalized s energies. Here we numerically compare our results with well known theoretical and numerical bounds for these latter quantities using results of Wagner, Kuijlaars and Saff, and Rakhmanov, Saff, and Zhou, see [\cite=W1], [\cite=W2], [\cite=KS1], [\cite=RSZ], and [\cite=RSZ1]. Finally, in Section 4, we briefly discuss a natural extension of our method to finite fields of prime power orders. Appendices A and B contain numerical data to illustrate the effectiveness of our construction. The computer programs used to make these calculations can be obtained from the authors. Throughout, C will denote a positive constant which may take on different values at different times.

Spherical t-designs

In this section, we will study how well our points are distributed using spherical t-designs, a notion first introduced by Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel in [\cite=DGS].

Definition 2.1  A finite set X of points on the d-sphere Sd is a spherical t-design or a spherical design of strength t, if for every polynomial f of total degree t or less, the average value of f over the whole sphere is equal to the arithmetic average of its values on X. If this only holds for homogeneous polynomials of degree t, then X is called a spherical design of index t.

In other words, X is of index t if the Chebyshev-type quadrature formula

[formula]

is exact for all homogeneous polynomials [formula] of degree t (σd denotes the surface measure on Sd). A set X is a t-design if it is of index k for every k  ≤  t.

The concept of spherical t-designs has been studied extensively from various points of view, including representation theory, combinatorics, and approximation theory. For general references see [\cite=Baj:1992a] and [\cite=DGS]. The existence of spherical designs for every t and d and large enough N = |X| was first proved by Seymour and Zaslavsky in 1984 [\cite=SeyZas:1984a].

The first general construction of spherical designs for arbitrary t, d, and large enough N was given independently by Wagner [\cite=W] and Bajnok [\cite=Baj:1992a], who used N  ≥  C(d)tO(d4) and N  ≥  C(d)tO(d3) points, respectively. This bound was later reduced to C(d)td2 / 2 + d / 2 by Korevaar and Meyers [\cite=KM]. They believe that the minimum size of a t-design on Sd is C(d)td. Because of its theoretical and practical importance, there is a keen interest in finding explicit constructions for spherical t-designs on N points with N relatively small with respect to t and d.

For explicit constructions of spherical designs it is often convenient to use the following equivalent definition, for a proof see [\cite=DGS].

Lemma 2.2 A finite subset X of Sd is a spherical t-design if and only if for every homogeneous harmonic polynomial f of total degree t or less

[formula]

A polynomial [formula] is harmonic if it satisfies Laplace's equation Δf = 0. The set of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree k over Sd forms the vector space Harmk(Sd) with

[formula]

In particular, for small values of k we find that Φk(Sd) forms a basis for Harmk(Sd) where

Φ1(Sd) = {xi|0  ≤  i  ≤  d},

[formula]

[formula] and

[formula].

We now prove

Proposition 2.3  For every odd positive integer k, odd prime p, and dimension d  ≥  1, X(d,p) is a spherical design of index k. Furthermore, X(d,p) is a spherical 3-design.

Proof. Let us consider our point set X = X(d,p). Since for any reflection T with respect to the hyperplane xi = 0 (0  ≤  i  ≤  d + 1) we have XT = X, the equation

[formula]

will hold for every f = Πd + 1i = 0xkii∈Harmk(Sd) which has at least one variable xi with an exponent ki odd. This observation immediately implies that our point set X is a spherical design of index k for every odd integer k.

Furthermore, our point set X also remains fixed under a reflection U with respect to the hyperplane xi = xj (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d + 1), thus we also have

[formula]

for the quadratics of the form x2i - x2i + 1 (0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1). Therefore X satisfies Lemma 2.2 for t = 3 and is thus a 3-design. [formula]

While our construction does not, in general, give a spherical t-design for t  ≥  4, it is worth mentioning a few cases when it does. Namely, we prove the following.

Proposition 2.4  The sets X(3,3), X(2,5) and X(3,5) form spherical 5-designs, and X(1,7) is a spherical 7-design.

Proof. As noted before, X(1,7) is the regular octagon on the circle S1, hence a well known 7-design (see [\cite=CS]). To prove that X(3,3), X(2,5) and X(3,5) are spherical 5-designs, it suffices to verify that they are of index 4; this, together with Proposition 2.3 yields that they form 5-designs. To prove that they are of index 4, one can easily check that

[formula]

for the polynomials in Φ4(Sd). [formula]

Remark.  It is worth noting that the minimum size of a spherical 3-design on Sd is 2d + 2, and this is achieved by the vertices of the generalized regular octahedron. The size of our pointset, N(d,p), as given by equation (1.2), is generally a lot larger than this; however, our construction may prove useful for other purposes.

Generalized s energy

Given a set of points ωN: = {x1,...,xN},  N  ≥  1 on Sd and s > 0, we define the s energy associated with ωN by

[formula]

Fekete points on Sd, see {[\cite=KS1] and the references cited therein, are points that minimize the s > 0 energy over all sets of N points. Physically, this represents the energy of N charged particles that repel each other according to Coulomb's law. (See also [\cite=RSZ] for a discussion of Elliptic Fekete points: the case s = 0). From recent work of [\cite=DG], it is known that points of minimal energy for s  ≤  d are well separated in the sense that

[formula]

for all continuous functions f on Sd. Another way to understand this is to define for a given set of points ωN,

[formula]

The determination of δN is called Tammes problem or the Spherical packing problem, see [\cite=CS]. It asks to maximize the smallest distance among N points on Sd. More precisely, in [\cite=KS1], the authors have shown that uniformly for any s > d  ≥  2,

[formula]

for any set of points ω*N minimizing Ed(s,ω) over all sets of points ωN. Fixing N in the above and letting s  →    ∞   then implies that for any xi∈ω*N,  s > d,

[formula]

If d = 2, then it is a well known result of W. Habicht and B. L. van der Waerden, see [\cite=HW] that

[formula]

Thus for d = 2, the minimal energy s problem reduces to the best packing problem which is the optimal choice of points one might hope for. For 0 < s < d, the energy integral

[formula]

is finite and its value is

[formula]

where Γ denotes the gamma function. Using this fact, it has been shown, see [\cite=W1] and [\cite=W2], that for d - 2  ≤  s  ≤  d

[formula]

where

[formula]

In fact, for d = 2 and 0 < s < 2 it is conjectured, see [\cite=R], that

[formula]

where ζ denotes the Riemann zeta function defined by [formula]. In addition for s = d, it is known, see [\cite=KS1] that

[formula]

We first concentrate our efforts in computing E2(s,X),  s = 1,2 and 2.5 for p = 3,...,211. The numerical data is contained in Appendix A.

Report 3.1 (d = 2)

Numerical data for s = 1: Let

and

where here and throughout, for non-negative sequences an and bn, an  ~  bn if 1 / C  ≤  an / bn  ≤  C.

Then for p = 31,...,211,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus it seems likely that [formula] approaches 0 and moreover we may take C = 1.47 in (3.5).

Numerical data for s = 2. Let

[formula]

Then for p = 31,...,211,

[formula]

Thus e2,2 deviates from 1 / 8 with a maximum error of 0.205.

Numerical data for s = 3. Let

[formula]

Then for p = 31,...,211,

[formula]

Thus we may take C = 0.259 in (3.2).

We next computed E3(s,X),  s = 2,3 and 3.125 for p = 3,...,83. The numerical data is contained in Appendix B.

Thus e3,3 deviates from [formula] with a maximum error of 0.091.

Numerical data for s = 3.125. Let

[formula]

Then for p = 31,...,83,

[formula]

Thus we may take C = 3.95 in (3.2).

Finally we considered numerically results on the spacings of our points for d = 2 and d = 3. To achieve our lower bounds, it suffices to apply (3.2) together with (3.1). We did this using our results above for d = 2,  s = 2.5 and d = 3,  s = 3.125. Our data below shows that our points on Sd, d = 2 and d = 3 are separated numerically by a factor of order O(1 / N1 / d + 1 / s) with a perturbation factor of order O(1 / N1 / s) to the ideal order O(1 / N1 / d). More precisely, we have:

Report 3.3 (spacing)  For any xi∈X, the following hold:

For d = 2 and p = {3,...,211}

[formula]

For d = 3 and p = {3,...,81}

Extension to finite fields of odd prime powers

In this last section, we briefly observe that we may solve the same quadratic form (1.1) over a general finite field Fq, where q = pe is an odd prime power and in this way distribute points on Sd as well. One way to do this is as follows. Assume that q = pe, with e  ≥  1. Then the field Fq is an e-dimensional vector space over the field Fp. Let [formula] be a basis of Fq over Fp. Thus if α∈Fq, then α can be uniquely written as [formula], where each ai∈Fp. Moreover, we may assume that each ai satisfies - (p - 1) / 2  ≤  ai  ≤  (p - 1) / 2.

If [formula] is a solution to the quadratic form (1.1) over Fq, then each xi is of the form xi  =  α∈Fq. Corresponding to the finite field element xi  =  α, we may now naturally associate the integer [formula]. It is an easy exercise to check that indeed  - (pe - 1) / 2  ≤  Mi  ≤  (pe - 1) / 2. We then map the vector [formula] to the surface of the unit sphere Sd by normalizing the vector V. We note that when e = 1, this reduces to our original construction. In particular, for increasing values of e, we obtain an increasing number Ne of points scattered on the surface of the unit sphere Sd, so that as e  →    ∞  , it is clear that Ne  →    ∞  .

In light of the success of our initial investigation for the special case e = 1, a detailed analysis of the cases where e  >  1 may warrant further investigation.
