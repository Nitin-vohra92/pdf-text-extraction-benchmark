Introduction

The classical Dedekind sum is defined for [formula], [formula] by adopting the usual notation where {x}: = x - ⌊x⌋ stands for the fractional part of x (cf. [\cite=IKW], [\cite=RadGro1972]). If gcd (h,k) = 1, then s(h,k) can be represented as

[formula]

and

[formula]

The identities [\eqref=cot_repres] and [\eqref=inf_repres] were derived in 1933 by H. Rademacher [\cite=Rad1933] in order to obtain a simple direct proof of the reciprocity formula for the Dedekind sums. See also [\cite=RadGro1972]. According to [\cite=Alm1998], [\eqref=cot_repres] was obtained earlier, in 1923 by H. Mellin. The identity [\eqref=cot_repres] is also the starting point for various generalizations of s(h,k). See, e.g., the papers of M. Beck [\cite=Bec2003], U. Dieter [\cite=Die1984], D. Zagier [\cite=Zag1973].

It is known that [\eqref=cot_repres] is a direct consequence of a variant of Parseval's formula for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). See the paper of G. Almkvist [\cite=Alm1998] and the book by M. Beck and S. Robins [\cite=BecRob2007]. More specifically, consider a function [formula], which is k-periodic (periodic with period k), where [formula]. We define the DFT of f as the function   =  F(f), given by

Furthermore, if f1 and f2 are k-periodic functions, then their inner product is having the property or equivalently,

[formula]

Now, [\eqref=cot_repres] follows by applying [\eqref=Parseval] to the functions

[formula]

and using the fact that the DFT of the sawtooth function is essentially the cotangent function.

It is the aim of this paper to exploit this idea in order to deduce similar finite trigonometric representations for certain new generalized Dedekind and Hardy sums, in a simple unified manner. Our results are direct applications of a higher dimensional version of the identity [\eqref=Parseval], included in Theorem [\ref=th_main]. We derive in this way Zagier-type identities for new higher dimensional generalizations of the Dedekind sums associated to the Bernoulli functions and of those Hardy sums which are defined by the sawtooth function. Note that all finite trigonometric representations we obtain contain only the tangent and cotangent functions, and are special cases of the Dedekind cotangent sums investigated by M. Beck [\cite=Bec2003]. Therefore the reciprocity law proved in [\cite=Bec2003] can be applied for each sum.

Furthermore, we consider a related sum, studied by M. Mikolás [\cite=Mik1957], involving the Hurwitz zeta function. We remark that [\eqref=Parseval] was used to evaluate some finite trigonometric and character sums, but not Dedekind and related sums, by M. Beck and M. Halloran [\cite=BecHal2010]. We point out that the identity [\eqref=inf_repres] can be obtained from [\eqref=cot_repres] using another general result (Lemma [\ref=lemma_2] in Section [\ref=Sect_Final_remarks]).

Properties of the DFT

We will apply the following general result.

Let [formula] be arbitrary k-periodic functions and let [formula], gcd (hj,k) = 1 (1  ≤  j  ≤  m), where [formula]. Then where hj' is the multiplicative inverse of hj (mod k), that is [formula] (mod k) with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m.

We only need some simple well known facts concerning the DFT. See, for instance [\cite=Ter1999], [\cite=BecRob2007]. The Cauchy convolution of the k-periodic functions f1 and f2 is defined by which is associative and commutative. Also,

[formula]

More generally, if [formula] are k-periodic functions, then

[formula]

Recalling that

[formula]

which is valid for every k-periodic f, this yields that is

For n = 0 we obtain

[formula]

Now the result follows from [\eqref=simple] by showing the following property: Let f be a k-periodic function and let [formula] such that gcd (h,k) = 1. Then the DFT of the function g defined by g(n) = f(nh) ([formula]) is q(n) = (nh') ([formula]), where h' is the multiplicative inverse of h (mod k).

Indeed, and since gcd (h,k) = 1, if a runs through a complete system of residues (mod k), then so does b = ah. Therefore,

Let f1 and f2 be k-periodic functions ([formula]) and let [formula], gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

[formula]

Apply Theorem [\ref=th_main] for m = 2. We deduce that

[formula]

by using the fact that if a runs through a complete system of residues (mod k), then so does b = ah1'h2', since gcd (h1h2,k) = 1. This gives [\eqref=Dedekind_m_2_general] by setting h2: =  - h2.

For h1 = 1, h2 =  - 1 from [\eqref=Dedekind_m_2_general] we derive [\eqref=Parseval].

Let f1 and f2 be k-periodic functions ([formula]) and assume that f1 or f2 is odd (resp. even). Let [formula], gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

[formula]

where s = 1 if f1 or f2 is odd, s = 0 if f1 or f2 is even.

Note that if the function f is odd (resp. even), then [formula] is also odd (resp. even). If one of the functions f1,f2 is odd and the other one is even, then both sides of [\eqref=Dedekind_m_2] are zero.

In this paper we will use the following DFT pairs of k-periodic functions.

Let [formula]. The DFT of the k-periodic odd function [formula] ([formula]) is

(ii) Let [formula] and let [formula] ([formula]) be the Bernoulli functions (cf. Section [\ref=subsect_2_1]). The DFT of the k-periodic function [formula] ([formula]) is where Br is the r-th Bernoulli number and cot (m) is the m-th derivative of the cotangent function.

(iii) Let [formula] be even. The DFT of the k-periodic odd function [formula] ([formula]) is

(iv) Let k be odd and let [formula] be the least nonnegative residue of n (mod k). The DFT of the k-periodic odd function is

(v) Let [formula]. Let F(s,x), ζ(s,x) and ζ(s) be the periodic zeta function, the Hurwitz zeta function, and the Riemann zeta function, respectively (cf. Section [\ref=subsect_3_3]). For [formula] the DFT of the k periodic function [formula] ([formula]) is

Here (i) and (iv) are well known. They follow, together with (iii) and (v), by easy computations from the definition of the DFT. For (ii) we refer to [\cite=Bec2003]. See also [\cite=Alm1998].

Applications

Generalized Dedekind sums

We first derive the following higher dimensional generalization of the identity [\eqref=cot_repres], first deduced by D. Zagier [\cite=Zag1973], in a slightly different form, by applying some other arguments.

Let [formula], [formula] be even and let [formula], gcd (hj,k) = 1 (1  ≤  j  ≤  m). Then

[formula]

Apply Theorem [\ref=th_main] for [formula], where [formula] ([formula]). Use Lemma [\ref=lemma]/(i).

Note that if m is odd, then both sides of [\eqref=higher_dim_Dedekind] are zero.

m = 2. Let [formula], [formula], gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

[formula]

Identity [\eqref=cot_repres_homog] is the homogeneous version of [\eqref=cot_repres] and is equivalent to [\eqref=cot_repres].

Now consider the Bernoulli polynomials Br(x) (r  ≥  0), defined by

Here

[formula]

are the Bernoulli numbers. The Bernoulli functions [formula] are given by

Note that

[formula]

but

[formula]

For [formula], [formula] we define the higher dimensional Dedekind-Bernoulli sum by

[formula]

In the case when m = 2 and by setting h2: =  - h2 we obtain the sum

[formula]

first investigated by L. Carlitz [\cite=Car1953] and M. Mikolás [\cite=Mik1957]. See the paper of M. Beck [\cite=Bec2003] for further historical remarks.

Let [formula] be such that [formula] is even and [formula], gcd (hj,k) = 1 (1  ≤  j  ≤  m). Then

[formula]

Note that if A is odd, then the sum in [\eqref=Bern_gen] vanishes. If A is odd and there is at least one j such that rj  ≥  3, then Brj = 0 and the sum [\eqref=Bern_gen_def] vanishes as well.

Apply Theorem [\ref=th_main] and Lemma [\ref=lemma]/(ii) to the functions

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula] be such that r1 + r2 is even and gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

Generalized Hardy sums

The Hardy sums (known also as Hardy-Berndt sums) are defined for [formula], [formula] as follows.

[formula]

B. C. Berndt and L. A. Goldberg [\cite=BerGol1984] derived finite and infinite series representations for the above sums. These identities were also obtained later by R. Sitaramachandrarao [\cite=Sit1987] by using some different arguments. One could see [\cite=Bec2003] [\cite=BerGol1984] [\cite=Die1984] [\cite=Sit1987] for the history of these sums as well as for further results on the Hardy sums, including reciprocity formulas.

We define the following generalization of s2(h,k):

Let [formula] be even, [formula], h1 odd, gcd (hj,k) = 1 (1  ≤  j  ≤  m). Then

Let [formula] and [formula] (2  ≤  j  ≤  m). Apply Theorem [\ref=th_main] and Lemma [\ref=lemma]/(i),(iv).

Assume that m = 2. Let [formula] be even, [formula], h1 odd, and gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

In the case m = 2, h1 = 1, h2 = h we obtain the following corollary, cf. [\cite=BerGol1984], [\cite=Sit1987].

If [formula] is even, [formula], gcd (h,k) = 1, then

Next, we define the following common generalization of s1(h,k), s3(h,k) and s5(h,k), as follows.

Let [formula] be odd, [formula] be even, [formula], gcd (hj,k) = 1 (1  ≤  j  ≤  m). Then

Apply Theorem [\ref=th_main] to the following functions:

[formula]

and also Lemma [\ref=lemma]/(iv).

Assume that m = 2. Let [formula] be odd, [formula], h1 odd, gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

For m = 2 in the special cases h1 = 1, h2 = h and h1 = h, h2 = 1, respectively, we obtain the identities, cf. [\cite=BerGol1984], [\cite=Sit1987], as follows.

If [formula] is odd, [formula], gcd (h,k) = 1, then

[formula]

If [formula] is odd, [formula] is odd, gcd (h,k) = 1, then

Assume that m = 2. Let [formula] be odd, [formula], h1 even, gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1. Then

For m = 2 in the special case h1 = h even, h2 = 1 we obtain the identity, cf. [\cite=BerGol1984], [\cite=Sit1987], as follows.

If [formula] is odd, [formula] is even, gcd (h,k) = 1, then

[formula]

Note that the Hardy sums S(h,k) and s4(h,k) can also be treated with the DFT in the case when k is odd. For example, applying Corollary [\ref=coroll_2] to the functions we obtain the following representation.

If [formula] is odd, [formula], gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1, then

[formula]

If h2 = 1 and h1 = h is odd, then the left hand side of [\eqref=form_s_4_gen] is exactly s4(h,k). See [\cite=BerGol1984], [\cite=Sit1987]. If h1 = h2 = 1, then [\eqref=form_s_4_gen] provides the following classical identity, valid for [formula] odd, cf. [\cite=BecHal2010]:

One could possibly investigate some further higher dimensional generalizations and analogues of the Hardy sums involving the Bernoulli functions, however we do not discuss this in the present paper.

Sums involving the Hurwitz zeta function

Theorem [\ref=th_main] and its corollaries can be applied in several other situations as well. For example, let be the Hurwitz zeta function, where 0 < x  ≤  1 and ζ(s,1) = ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function. The function investigated by M. Mikolás [\cite=Mik1957], is an analogue of the Dedekind sum [\eqref=Ded_Bern_2], taking into account that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the periodic zeta function, which converges for [formula] if [formula] and for [formula] if [formula].

Applying Corollary [\ref=cor_m_2_gen] to the functions

[formula]

we deduce by Lemma [\ref=lemma]/(v) the next new result.

Let [formula], [formula], gcd (h1,k) =  gcd (h2,k) = 1 and let [formula], [formula]. Then

Some further remarks

The following simple and useful result can be applied to obtain infinite series representations for the Dedekind and Hardy sums.

If [formula] is a k-periodic ([formula]) odd function, then

[formula]

For the Dedekind sum, [\eqref=inf_repres] is a direct consequence of identities [\eqref=series_1] and [\eqref=cot_repres]. As another example, [\eqref=series_1] and [\eqref=repres_s_3] imply that for k odd, gcd (h,k) = 1, one has

One could see [\cite=BerGol1984], [\cite=Sit1987] for the above formula as well as for similar representations regarding Hardy sums.

Identity [\eqref=series_1] of Lemma [\ref=lemma_2] was proved in [\cite=Sit1987] by applying results of D. H. Lehmer [\cite=Leh1975] on the generalized Euler constants γ(r,k) associated with the infinite arithmetic progression [formula] (1  ≤  r  ≤  k), where

B. C. Berndt [\cite=Ber1979] deduced [\eqref=series_2] by contour integration (with a different definition of the DFT). The fact that the finite sums [\eqref=series_1] and [\eqref=series_2] are equal, provides another simple consequence of Corollary [\ref=coroll_2], applied to the odd functions [formula] and [formula].

Furthermore, according to [\cite=Leh1975], if f is a k-periodic function, then provided that [formula], representing a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the series S(f) (which holds if f is a k-periodic and odd function).

We note that the DFT of the k-periodic function r  ↦  γ(r,k) is (cf. [\cite=Leh1975]), where F(s,x) is the periodic zeta function defined by [\eqref=period_zeta] and γ: = γ(0,1) is Euler's constant. Therefore, we deduce by Corollary [\ref=cor_m_2_gen] the next identity.

If [formula] is a k-periodic ([formula]) odd function, then
