Operational meaning of quantum measures of recovery

Introduction

There are many facets of quantum science in which the notion of quantum state recovery is deeply embedded. This is particularly true for quantum error correction [\cite=Gai08] [\cite=LB13] and quantum key distribution [\cite=SBCDLP09], where the primary goal is fundamentally that of recovery. In the former, the task is to reconstruct a quantum state where some part of the state has undergone noise or loss; in the latter, the task is to keep a message secure against an eavesdropper attempting a similar reconstruction. In either case, the success or failure of a protocol often hinges on whether a particular state in question is recoverable at all, or if the state is beyond repair.

A particularly important class of states are those that constitute a Markov chain. A classical Markov chain can be understood as a memoryless random process, i.e., a process in which the state transition probability depends only on the current state, and not on past states. If random variables X, Y, and Z form a classical Markov chain as X  →  Y  →  Z, then the classical conditional mutual information I(X;Z|Y) = 0, where [formula] and H(X) is equal to the Shannon entropy of X. Classical Markov chains model an impressive number of natural processes in physics and many other sciences [\cite=Norris97].

An attempt at understanding a quantum generalization of these ideas was put forward in [\cite=HJPW04], but it was later realized that these notions made sense only in the exact case [\cite=ILW08]. That is, in analogy with the classical case mentioned above, the authors of [\cite=HJPW04] defined a quantum Markov chain to be a tripartite state ρABC for which the conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) I(A;B|C)ρ is equal to zero, where [formula] and H(AC)ρ is equal to the von Neumann entropy of the reduced state ρAC. However, the later work in [\cite=ILW08] (see also [\cite=E15]) demonstrated that large perturbations of a quantum Markov state as defined in [\cite=HJPW04] can sometimes lead only to small increases of the CQMI, calling into question the definition of quantum Markov chains from [\cite=HJPW04].

Meanwhile, it was well known for some time that an equivalent description for the exact case I(A;B|C)ρ  =  0 exists in terms of recoverability. The work of Petz [\cite=Petz1986] [\cite=Petz1988] implies that there exists a recovery channel RC  →  AC such that ρABC  =  RC  →  AC(ρBC) if and only if I(A;B|C)ρ  =  0. This is in perfect analogy with the exact classical case mentioned above: for a state satisfying I(A;B|C)ρ  =  0, one could lose the A system and recover it back from C alone. In this sense, all correlations between systems A and B are mediated through system C for quantum Markov chain states. Recoverability in this sense is thus intimately connected to Markovianity and represents a method for handling the approximate case, different from that given in [\cite=HJPW04].

To measure non-Markovianity in the approximate case, the general approach outlined in [\cite=SW14] was to quantify the "distance" from ρABC to its closest recovered version. The main measure on which [\cite=SW14] focused was the fidelity of recovery, defined as

[formula]

where the quantum fidelity [formula] for density operators ω and τ [\cite=U73]. The optimization in [\eqref=eq:fidrec] is with respect to quantum channels RC  →  AC acting on the C system and producing an output on the A and C systems. A related measure, defined in [\cite=SW14], is the relative entropy of recovery:

[formula]

The quantum relative entropy is defined as [formula] if [formula] and it is equal to +    ∞   otherwise [\cite=U62]. These are clearly well motivated measures of recovery / non-Markovianity, but hitherto they have been lacking concrete operational interpretations. This is the main question that we address in this paper.

From the main result of [\cite=FR14], which established that I(A;B|C)ρ  ≥    -   log F(A;B|C)ρ, it is now understood that the CQMI itself is a measure of non-Markovianity as well. Before [\cite=FR14], an operational interpretation for the CQMI had already been given in [\cite=DY08] [\cite=YD09] as twice the optimal rate of quantum communication needed for a sender to transfer one share of a tripartite state to a receiver (generally shared entanglement is required for this task). Here, the decoder at the receiving end in this protocol plays the role of a recovery operation, an interpretation later used in [\cite=BHOS14]. A wave of recent work [\cite=BCY11] [\cite=Winterconj] [\cite=K13conj] [\cite=Z14] [\cite=BSW14] [\cite=SBW14] [\cite=LW14] [\cite=BLW14] [\cite=DW15] [\cite=BT15] [\cite=SOR15] [\cite=W15] [\cite=DW15a] [\cite=Sutter15] [\cite=Junge15] on this topic has added to and complements [\cite=FR14], solidifying what appears to be the right notion of quantum Markovianity.

It follows from the concerns in recovery applications that one may have to systematically decide whether or not a given tripartite quantum state is recoverable. In this paper, we discuss two concrete scenarios in which this is the case. The first scenario is an experiment involving a single copy of the state ρABC and the second involves many copies of such a state--for both settings, the goal is to decide whether a given tripartite state is recoverable.

In more detail, the first scenario asks: given a description of a quantum circuit that prepares a state ρABC, what is the maximum probability with which someone could be convinced that the state is recoverable? Also, how difficult is the task of deciding if the state meets some criteria of recoverability when A is lost? We address these questions by defining the associated decision problem, called FoR for "fidelity of recovery." Using ideas from quantum complexity theory [\cite=W09] [\cite=VW15], we show that the fidelity of recovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a verifier can be convinced that ρABC is recoverable from ρBC by acting on system C alone. Not only does this establish an operational meaning for the fidelity of recovery, but it also establishes that FoR is contained in the complexity class QIP [\cite=JJUW11] and that FoR is hard for QSZK [\cite=W02] [\cite=W09zkqa], a class of problems believed to be difficult to solve even by a quantum computer. Our construction of a quantum interactive proof system that realizes the containment FoR ⊆   QIP follows intuitively from the duality property of fidelity of recovery, originally established in [\cite=SW14]. The hardness result builds on earlier work in [\cite=v011a003].

The second scenario is an experiment involving many copies of the state ρABC. Let n be a large positive integer. Suppose that either the state [formula] is prepared or the state [formula] is, where RCn  →  AnCn is some arbitrary collective recovery channel acting on all n of the C systems. The goal is then to determine which is the case by performing a collective measurement on all of the systems AnBnCn. There are two ways that one could make a mistake in this hypothesis testing setup. The first is known as the Type I error, and it is equal to the probability of concluding that [formula] was prepared if in fact [formula] was prepared. The other kind of error is the Type II error. Defining the regularized relative entropy of recovery as follows [\cite=BHOS14]:

[formula]

we prove that the optimal exponent for the Type II error is equal to D∞(A;B|C)ρ if the Type I error is constrained to be no larger than a constant ε∈(0,1). That is, there exists a measurement such that the Type II error goes as ≈  2- nD∞(A;B|C)ρ with the Type I error no larger than ε. However, if one tries to make the Type II error decay faster than ≈  2- nD∞(A;B|C)ρ, then it is impossible to meet the Type I constraint for any ε∈(0,1). Thus, our result establishes a concrete operational interpretation of the regularized relative entropy of recovery in this hypothesis testing experiment. It was previously shown in [\cite=BHOS14] that I(A;B|C)ρ  ≥  D∞(A;B|C)ρ  ≥    -   log F(A;B|C)ρ, but no operational interpretation of D∞(A;B|C)ρ was given there. In the rest of the paper, we provide more details of these two operational interpretations in order to justify them.

Operational meaning of fidelity of recovery

We now provide an operational interpretation for the fidelity of recovery, by considering the following computational task:

Let α,β∈[0,1] such that α  >  β. Given is a description of a quantum circuit that prepares a tripartite state ρABC, where [formula] with n equal to the circuit size (number of gates), and a promise that

[formula]

Decide which of the above is the case.

The additional assumption that α  -  β  ≥  [null]- 1 is a common assumption which allows for amplifying the probability of deciding correctly, by employing parallel repetition [\cite=QIPAmp00]. This kind of assumption is required for most applications in quantum complexity theory [\cite=KSV02].

The computational problem FoR is defined with the following in mind: a party constructs a state ρABC by acting with the gates specified in a given circuit, and wants to know whether it is possible, if system A is lost, to recover the state when given access to system C only. A YES-instance of this problem then corresponds to a recoverable state, since by the definition of fidelity of recovery in [\eqref=eq:fidrec], there exists a recovery channel RC  →  AC which acts on ρBC and satisfies the recovery criteria. A NO-instance implies that no such recovery channel exists. We note that this problem is distinct from deciding whether ρABC is recoverable starting from the specification of the density matrix, a problem which has been shown to be decidable in classical polynomial time via a semi-definite program [\cite=BT15].

In order to have a robust operational meaning, it is important that this decision problem have an efficient verification strategy so that another party is unable to convince the verifier that a state is recoverable, if in fact it is not. The complexity class QIP(k), introduced in [\cite=QIPAmp00] [\cite=QIP03], captures this concept. A problem is said to be in QIP(k) if, given k distinct quantum messages exchanged between a verifier and a computationally unbounded prover, the verifier will accept YES-instances and reject NO-instances with very high probability. The prover will always try to make the verifier accept, regardless of whether the state in question is a YES- or NO-instance. To prove FoR ⊆   QIP, we will show that F(A;B|C)ρ is equal to the maximum acceptance probability of the verifier in a particular quantum interactive proof system. If this is true, then we can immediately conclude that the probability of accepting a YES-instance is no smaller than α, and the probability of accepting a NO-instance is no larger than β, satisfying the properties of a QIP system. These probabilities can then be amplified to be exponentially close to the extremes of one and zero, respectively, by employing parallel repetition [\cite=QIPAmp00].

We now give an outline of a quantum interactive proof system with maximum acceptance probability equal to the fidelity of recovery, thus witnessing the containment FoR ⊆   QIP. Recall that, for any pure four-party state φABCD, the fidelity of recovery obeys the duality relation F(A;B|C)φ = F(A;B|D)φ [\cite=SW14]. The proof system we construct is related to the methods used in [\cite=SW14] to establish this relation, but here we will have a computationally unbounded prover implement the recovery channel and an "Uhlmann" unitary [\cite=U73]. In the setup of quantum interactive proofs, it is apparently necessary for such a prover to implement these channels given that the dimension of the Hilbert space is essentially exponentially large in n (size of the circuit needed to generate ρABC). More explicitly, consider the following interaction between a verifier and a prover (see Figure [\ref=fig:for] for a visual depiction):

Verifier uses the description of the quantum circuit to prepare the mixed state ρABC (with system D a purifying system). In Figure [\ref=fig:for], this is denoted by a unitary Uρ acting on many qubits prepared in the state |0〉, which we abbreviate simply as |0〉. The unitary Uρ has output systems A, B, C, and D. So then [formula] where [formula].

Verifier sends system C to the prover.

Prover acts with a general unitary UCE  →  A'C'F on system C and an ancilla system E prepared in a fiducial state |0〉E, and the output systems are F, A', and C'.

Prover sends systems A' and C' to the verifier.

Verifier sends systems A and D to the prover.

Prover acts with a unitary VADF  →  D'G on systems F, A, and D that has output systems D' and G.

Prover sends D' back to the verifier.

The verifier accepts if and only if the projection of the final state onto the pure state φA'BC'D' is successful. This test can be conducted by applying the inverse of the preparation unitary Uρ, measuring each of the output qubits in the computational basis, and accepting if and only if the measurement outcomes are all zeros.

From this interaction, we can show via a chain of equalities that the maximum acceptance probability of the proof system is equal to the fidelity of recovery of the state ρABC. Consider that the maximum acceptance probability is equal to the following Euclidean norm:

[formula]

where the first equality follows because there exists a unit vector |φ〉G which achieves the norm and the second because the optimization over |φ〉G can be absorbed into the optimization over the unitary [formula]. Consider that systems F, A, and D purify the following state

[formula]

and systems D and G purify the following state:

[formula]

Thus, by Uhlmann's theorem [\cite=U73] with [formula] as the Uhlmann unitary, it follows that [\eqref=eq:max-accept-prob-1] is equal to

[formula]

where the equality follows by the well known theorem of Stinespring [\cite=S55], which states that any quantum channel can be realized by adjoining an ancilla system, acting with a unitary, and tracing out a system. This establishes an operational interpretation of fidelity of recovery as the maximum acceptance probability of our quantum interactive proof system for FoR. By the reasoning given above, it follows that FoR ⊆   QIP.

To establish that FoR is hard for QSZK, we need only consider that a special case of FoR occurs when the C system is trivial, in which case the recovery channel reduces to a preparation of a state on system A and we then need to decide whether [formula] is above or below a given threshold. This problem however has already been shown in [\cite=v011a003] to be QSZK-complete, from which we conclude that FoR is hard for QSZK.

Operational meaning of regularized relative entropy of recovery

Here we provide an operational interpretation of the regularized relative entropy of recovery in the context of quantum hypothesis testing [\cite=HP91] [\cite=ON00]. The setting is as discussed in the introduction: Given are n copies of a state ρABC, and the task is to determine whether [formula] is prepared or whether [formula] is prepared, where RCn  →  AnCn is some recovery channel. This is an instance of a more general problem of discriminating between a state [formula] and a set [formula] of states, where in our case:

[formula]

with CPTP denoting the set of quantum channels from Cn to AnCn. This more general setting was studied in detail in [\cite=BP10], where it was found that the Type II rate of convergence simplifies if the following conditions hold:

(Convexity) [formula] is convex and closed for all n.

(Full Rank) There exists a full rank state σ such that each [formula] contains [formula].

(Reduction) For each [formula], Tr[formula].

(Concatenation) If [formula] and [formula], then [formula].

(Permutation invariance) [formula] is closed under permutations.

We now verify that the set [formula] as defined in ([\ref=eq:set-S-recover]) satisfies the above properties.

Convexity. Let [formula]. Then for all [formula], we have that because [formula] is a quantum channel if R1Cn  →  AnCn and R2Cn  →  AnCn are. Furthermore, the set of all CPTP maps is closed.

Full Rank. Without loss of generality, we can assume that ρB is a full rank state. A particular recovery channel is one which traces out system C and replaces with the maximally mixed state on AC. Taking n copies of such a state gives a full-rank state in [formula].

Reduction. Let [formula]. Consider that

[formula]

This state is in [formula] because the recovery channel for [formula] could consist of tensoring in ρC, applying RCn  →  AnCn, and tracing out systems AnCn.

Concatenation. Let [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

because

[formula]

so that the recovery channel consists of the parallel concatenation of R1Cn  →  AnCn and R2Cm  →  AmCm.

Permutation invariance. Here, we need to show that for [formula], we have that [formula] for all permutations π of the n systems. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

where the second equality follows because the permutation of the B systems commutes with the recovery channel, the third because [formula] is a permutation invariant state, and the last line because a potential recovery consists of applying the permutation π†Cn, followed by RCn  →  AnCn, followed by the permutation [formula].

From here, we can define a hypothesis testing relative entropy of recovery for a state ρABC as follows: where DεH is the hypothesis testing relative entropy [\cite=BD10] [\cite=WR10], defined for two states ω and τ as

[formula]

By definition, the hypothesis testing relative entropy DεH is equal to the optimal Type II error exponent when the Type I error cannot exceed ε∈(0,1). By employing the main result of [\cite=BP10] and the above observations, we can conclude that

[formula]

for all [formula]. (Note that the limit as [formula] is not needed.) This gives an operational interpretation of D∞(A;B|C)ρ as the optimal Type II error exponent as claimed.

Conclusion

We have given operational meaning to two different recovery measures: the fidelity of recovery and the relative entropy of recovery. The first occurs in a "one-shot" scenario, where we find that the fidelity of recovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a quantum prover can convince a quantum verifier that a given state is recoverable. As an additional contribution, we make progress on a computational problem related to recoverability by showing that the problem FoR is in QIP and is hard for QSZK. The second operational interpretation occurs in a scenario involving many copies of a given tripartite state and represents a generalization of quantum Stein's lemma [\cite=HP91] [\cite=ON00]. We showed that the optimal Type II error exponent is equal to the regularized relative entropy of recovery if there is a constraint on the Type I error.

Going forward from here, it would be interesting to give better bounds on the computational problem FoR. For example, would it be possible to reduce the number of quantum messages needed to decide whether a given state is recoverable? Could we show that the general recoverability problem is hard for QIP(2)? For the hypothesis testing setup, can we give finer characterizations of the optimal Type II exponent when the Type I error is not a fixed constant but decays as well (cf., [\cite=MO15])? Perhaps the Renyi relative entropy of recovery studied in [\cite=BFT15] would be relevant here? This question was recently addressed and solved in the specialized classical case [\cite=TH15], but additivity issues pose a significant challenge to extending results like these to the quantum case.
