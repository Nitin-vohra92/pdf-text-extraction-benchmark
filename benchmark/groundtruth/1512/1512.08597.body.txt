Entanglement and corner Hamiltonian spectra of integrable open spin chains

Introduction

In the 1935 paper, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen presented a thought experiment in which physical measurements in one system could produce completely predictable results regarding the wave function of the second system, provided the two systems were initially described by a single, many-body wave function to begin with [\cite=EPR]. The argument was presented as evidence of the inadequacy of the wave function description of nature. Schrödinger immediately corroborated the EPR idea with a more careful mathematical formulation, equivalent to the Schmidt decomposition of the many-body wave function into two disjoint parts [\cite=Schrodinger], and claimed that such 'entanglement' of two subsystems is a key characteristic of quantum mechanics rather than an evidence of its inadequacy. In the modern era, entanglement of quantum systems has been a flourishing theme in quantum optics and quantum information sciences. Several factors helped push the entanglement idea over to the many-body condensed matter physics in recent years, most notably due to the realization that low-energy quantum states obey the so-called area law.

The pioneering works of Bekenstein [\cite=bekenstein73] and Hawking [\cite=hawking75] showed that a black hole's entropy is proportional to the area of its horizon. Srednicki showed that the same area law is found in the simple model of non-interacting bosons in three dimension [\cite=srednicki93]. The question of the "geometric entropy" (nowadays called the entanglement entropy) was examined in the context of (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) [\cite=wilczek94]. Logarithmic dependence of the entropy on the length of the subsystem was found.

Later Vidal et al. [\cite=vidal03] studied one-dimensional lattice spin models numerically and demonstrated that the entanglement entropy displays the logarithmic dependence on the subsystem size, with the prefactor proportional to the central charge of the corresponding CFT [\cite=wilczek94]. The CFT results were then generalized extensively to a conformal system with boundaries or at finite temperature by Calabrese and Cardy [\cite=calabrese04].

While numerically investigating the dependence of the entanglement entropy (EE) on the length of the subsystem in the XXZ quantum spin chain, Laflorencie et al. [\cite=affleck06] noticed an oscillation in the EE that could not be accounted for by the Calabrese-Cardy formula. The oscillatory behavior of the EE in a finite spin chain was subsequently observed in spin models with SU(3) symmetry [\cite=solyom07] and an SU(N) Hubbard model [\cite=solyom08]. Renyi entanglement entropy (REE), of which the von Neumann entanglement entropy can be viewed as a special case, also shows a similar oscillatory behavior [\cite=calabrese10] [\cite=xavier11] [\cite=xavier12] [\cite=kaul15]. Calabrese and collaborators proposed a scaling form for the oscillatory part of the EE [\cite=calabrese10], and yet a firm mathematical derivation of the oscillatory formula remains an open problem.

At the dawn of the DMRG era, a fundamental connection of the reduced density matrix for the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian with the corner transfer matrix of some two-dimensional statistical mechanical model was noted [\cite=nishino96] [\cite=nishino97] [\cite=nishino97book] [\cite=peschel98]. As neatly summarized and numerically confirmed in Ref. [\cite=peschel98], it boils down to the statement that the entanglement spectra obtained from the reduced density matrix of a one-dimensional integrable model must be "the same" as the spectra of some corner Hamiltonian KCH, related to the corner transfer matrix C through [formula] with some constant κ. In the modern vocabulary the statement is that of ES-CS (entanglement spectra - corner spectra) correspondence. It is remarkable that these observations were made well before the concept and the terminology of "entanglement spectra" became popular in the many-body entanglement community, and yet have failed to attract significant attention after the widespread use of the ES as the de facto means of analysis in low-dimensional quantum models [\cite=haldane08]. Early DMRG studies have focused on the ES of integrable models (transverse Ising model, XYZ model, etc.) that have an energy gap, and purposely stayed away from looking into models at criticality such as the SU(N) spin chains [\cite=peschel98]. Since then a large body of literature was accumulated regarding the entanglement aspects of gapless, critical SU(N) spin models[\cite=affleck06] [\cite=solyom07] [\cite=calabrese10] [\cite=xavier11] [\cite=xavier12] [\cite=kaul15]. Whether the ES-CS correspondence should hold for critical spin models is an issue that was never brought up before.

In this paper we successfully bridge this gap in the literature and in our understanding of ES by showing that the site-by-site entanglement spectra ES(n) in a finite-size critical SU(N) spin chain with open boundaries is virtually identical to the spectra of the corner Hamiltonian of length n. Specifically, in an open chain of length L, ES is calculated for each and every cut position n starting with n = 1 (n vs. L - n spins in the bipartition) for the SU(N) Hamiltonian [formula], and found them to be numerically identical, within a few percent difference, to the spectra of the corner Hamiltonian [formula] of length n, after an overall re-scaling. We find this to be the case for all critical SU(N) spin models for 2  ≤  N  ≤  4 (and presumably true for even larger N). We find the same statement holds for a variety of integrable models such as the transverse Ising model at criticality and several integrable points in the phase diagram of the bilinear-biqadratic (BLBQ) spin-1 Hamiltonian. Surprisingly, the correspondence holds quite well over an extended region of the BLBQ phase diagram in the vicinity of the integrable points.

Our findings have some overlap with the earlier results in the late 90's but advance them much further by showing that the ES-CS correspondence extends for each n of the partition. Symbolically we can state the findings as

[formula]

The site-by-site ES also provides some fresh insights into the well-known oscillatory behavior of the entanglement entropy in the critical spin chain. We show that the period-N oscillation of the EE arises from that of the ES with the same period N for the SU(N) chains. In contrast to the algebraic decay of the oscillation amplitude in the EE [\cite=calabrese10], our DMRG study provides strong evidence that ES as a function of the cut position n settles into an oscillatory structure of period N with no sign of diminution deep inside the open chain. How to reconcile the persistence of the oscillating ES with the asymptotically uniform EE in the bulk of the chain is explained by a close examination of the new quantity we call the "weighted entanglement spectra" (WES).

In the following two sections we summarize the DMRG findings on the ES of the critical SU(N) chains for N = 2 (Heisenberg S = 1 / 2 spin chain), N = 3 (Uimin-Lai-Sutherland model [\cite=uimin] [\cite=lai] [\cite=sutherland]), and N = 4 (Kugel-Khomskii model [\cite=KK] [\cite=KK-su(4)]). Two main emphases are on the analogy of the ES with the corner Hamiltonian spectra for matching n, and the oscillatory behavior of the ES deep inside the chain. Sec. IV highlights the equivalence of entanglement and corner spectra for all the integrable models which we investigated. They include the aforementioned critical spin chains and other well-known integrable models such as transverse Ising model at criticality, and pure biquadratic and Takhtajan-Babujian (TB) models both belonging to the the family of the BLBQ spin-1 Hamiltonians.

SU(2) critical spin chain

Numerical results

We examine properties of the SU(2) critical spin chain written in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) algebra [formula] ([formula]=Pauli matrix),

[formula]

Open boundary condition (OBC) for a chain of length L is assumed. Ground states of the chain for lengths L = 60,200 are worked out by DMRG using the maximum number of Schmidt states kept in DMRG iterations as 1500. Calculations of the ES for the L = 60 chain was indistinguishable from the L = 200 results, which gives us the confidence that the bond dependence of the ES reported in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c) should hold for arbitrary length of the SU(2) chain with open boundaries. One can easily obtain the EE and ES for every cut starting from one edge after the completion of the DMRG iteration. Figure [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c) shows the ES(n) of L = 200 chain obtained by DMRG at the n-th bond, between sites n and n + 1, leaving the subsystem consisting of n spins. For instance n = 1 means only a single spin at the far left edge has been isolated as the subsystem. The two (up and down) spin degrees of freedom at the n = 1 site naturally explains the double degeneracy of the ES. For the n = 2 cut we see one single, and one triply degenerate ES levels.

By comparison we plot the spectra of the corner Hamiltonian (CH), defined as

[formula]

for a chain of length n. In Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (a), the corner Hamiltonian spectra is plotted for several n's. It is immediately clear that the corner spectra for n = 2 has the same singlet-triplet degeneracy structure found in the ES at the same n. In fact, inspection of Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg](a) and (c) reveals that such correspondence of entanglement and spectra of the CH extends without fault all the way up to n = 5. (We checked the exact correspondence all the way up to n = 10.)

Technically, the corner Hamiltonian is defined as the generator of the corner transfer matrix (CTM) [\cite=baxter]. The CTM was introduced by Baxter as a way to solve certain class of two-dimensional, classical statistical models in the 70's [\cite=baxter]. When DMRG was being developed, Okunishi [\cite=okunishi05] pointed out a close relation between the reduced density matrix of the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian, such as the SU(2) spin chain we examine here, to the corner transfer matrix of a suitably defined classical two-dimensional model. In turn, the generator of the CTM was found to have a simple relation to the original quantum Hamiltonian.

For later purposes, let us give a precise definition of the corner Hamiltonian corresponding to the SU(N) critical spin chain. Let hi be a 2-site Hamiltonian acting only on the sites i and i + 1, which is the permutation (up to a constant and an overall scaling). While the uniform Hamiltonian is just a sum of each hi, i.e., [formula], the corner Hamiltonian is given by multiplying each hi with the site label i: [formula].

Of course the degeneracy number is the dimension of all possible irreducible representations of the SU(2) and that the same degeneracy numbers appear in both the spectra of entanglement and CH are not that surprising since the global SU(2) must be a symmetry of both the wave function of the CH and the left Schmidt eigenstate. The nontrivial aspect lies, in our opinion, rather with the identical hierarchy of the levels in both spectra. Take n = 4 for instance, where one finds the degeneracies 1-3-3-1-3-5 in ascending values of the CH spectra. In Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c) one finds the identical sequence of degeneracies at n = 4, in ascending order of the entanglement spectra. The correspondence in the degeneracy hierarchy that exists between corner spectra and the entanglement spectra for each n is symbolically expressed,

[formula]

Later we will show that the correspondence is even stronger, in that the exact positions of each level match between the two spectra. We summarily express this observation as

[formula]

where κ is some model-specific scaling factor. The correspondence holds not only for critical spin chains, but also for other well-known integrable models, for each n.

Next we examine the EE of the SU(2) chain. The EE plot presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (b) has been obtained several times in the past [\cite=affleck06] [\cite=hastings09] [\cite=xavier11] [\cite=taddia11] [\cite=kaul15] in various spin-1/2 chain systems with OBCs. According to Refs. [\cite=calabrese04] [\cite=calabrese10] the EE in (1+1)-dimensional CFT with open boundaries will obey the formula [\cite=kaul15]:

[formula]

where Sn is the von Neumann entropy of the subsystem of length n, cN  =  N - 1 and Δa are the central charge and scaling dimensions of the SU(N)1 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory, L is the system size, c' is a non-universal constant, and finally Fa (n / L) is the universal scaling function which can be adequately approximated as a constant [\cite=kaul15]. For N = 2,3 there is only one scaling dimension coming into play (a = 1), but for N = 4 there exist two distinct scaling dimensions (a = 1,2) to account for. An excellent fit to the numerically obtained EE is possible by adjusting the constants c' and Fa as seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (b).

It is natural to suspect that the origin of the oscillating EE is the oscillation of the entanglement spectra itself. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c), the ES settles into a period-2 structure when sufficiently removed from the edge. For odd n the lowest entanglement level is doubly degenerate and all other levels have the even degeneracy as well. For even n the lowest entanglement level is unique and other levels have the odd degeneracy. A qualitative understanding of such structures will be given in the next subsection.

At first sight it might seem that period-2 oscillations in the ES is compatible with the alternating term in the EE. A close inspection of our numerical data shows, on the other hand, that the alternating structure in the ES does not diminish deep inside the chain, while the corresponding oscillation in the EE is known to decay algebraically as n approaches the center of the chain [\cite=affleck06]. It seems puzzling, even contradictory, that EE has decaying oscillations while the underlying ES does not. It also appears that the persistence of the period-2 ES oscillation is counter to the notion that boundary effects should decay algebraically away from the edge in a gapless system. To obtain some understanding of the apparent mismatch we introduce the notion of weighted entanglement spectrum, or WES, defined simply as

[formula]

for each Schmidt eigenvalue λα of the decomposition. Entanglement spectrum on the other hand is -   log (λ2α). Entanglement entropy is obtained by summing over all the WES's,

[formula]

The WES for each cut position n is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (d) with corresponding ES levels in matching colors. For n large and odd, only the two lowest entanglement levels, each doubly degenerate, contribute much to the entanglement entropy because they are the only ones with significant WES. For n large and even, the lowest singlet and the next-lowest triplet levels contribute dominantly to the entanglement entropy, while all other levels have WES's very close to zero. It is then entirely conceivable that two doublets at odd n and singlet+  triplet at even n have their WES levels distributed in such a crafted manner that their contributions to the entanglement entropy become similar. One can notice in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (d) a mild growth in the overall WES levels with increasing n, in agreement with the growing EE towards the middle of the chain. Overall, one can reconcile the asymptotically uniform behavior of the entanglement entropy with the persistent oscillation of the entanglement spectra by a close inspection of the behavior of WES.

Nevertheless, the persistent even-odd alternation of the ES or WES appears to run counter to the intuitive notion of decaying boundary effects that govern the behavior of physical observables such as the bond energy [formula] [\cite=affleck06]. It may be that (W)ES is not a physically observable quantity after all, and therefore need not behave like the rest of the measurable, thermodynamic quantities. Additionally, we find it surprising that the entanglement entropy is dominated by only a handful of entanglement levels, and furthermore the inspection of small-n (see WES for n = 2 and n = 3) WES structure is already adequate to account for the relevant WES for all following n's (see WES for all n  ≥  4).

Young tableaux consideration

Qualitative understanding of the ES in the ground state of SU(2) critical spin chain is possible with the Young tableaux consideration [\cite=greiter07] [\cite=greiter08] [\cite=thomale15]. For SU(2), a single tableau represents a spin doublet. When a cut is made between sites 1 and 2, namely n = 1, there exists a single spin in the left subsystem whereas all the other spins belong to the right subsystem. Let us call a spin (or a doublet) [formula] as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su2] (a). To minimize the energy of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, spin of the total system should be a singlet whenever possible, as also dictated by the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem [\cite=MLM]. Since [formula] is in the left subsystem, the only way for the total system to achieve [formula], a singlet, is to have another [formula] in the right subsystem and make a singlet combination of the two [formula]'s, [formula]. In other words even though there exist (N - 1) number of spins in the right subsystem, it still acts effectively as a single spin-1/2 object, i.e. a [formula]. Following this idea one can write down the many-body ground state of the chain as

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] symbolically expresses the composite state of the (N - 1) spins in the right subsystem with the total spin projection ±  1 / 2, and (l) refers to the left subsystem. From the second line, where we defined [formula], one can read off the two degenerate Schmidt eigenvalues [formula].

Moving on to the n = 2 cut, now we have two spin-1/2's in the left subsystem forming [formula] (singlet) and [formula] (triplet) as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su2] (b). Both [formula] and [formula] can form the total spin singlet with the composite spin on the right side either by [formula] or [formula]. The way to form [formula] out of two [formula]'s is

[formula]

The corresponding reduced density matrix for the left subsystem is easily worked out, ρ(l)  =  diag(1 / 3,1 / 3,1 / 3), leading to the triple degeneracy in the Schmidt eigenvalue shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c) at n = 2. The single ES level follows of course from [formula]. The ground state can therefore be written in the Schmidt form,

[formula]

On energetic grounds one expects the singlet part of the left wave function [formula] to have more weight than the triplet part [formula] in the make-up of the overall ground state, i.e. [formula]. After all, the triplet state [formula] is the excited state of the left subsystem and less likely to participate in the formation of the overall ground state. Inspection of the WES reveals, on the other hand, that [formula]. Since there are three states in the triplet, we find roughly three times as much contribution to the EE from the triplet Schmidt states as the singlet state.

Finally, take a look at the ES at n = 3. In the left subsystem we have one quartet and two doublets as shown in the Young tableaux diagram, Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su2] (c). The degeneracy of ES levels in Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c) for n = 3 coincides precisely with the dimensionality of each Young tableaux. Expressed as a Schmidt form at n = 3, the ground state reads

[formula]

Each of the Schmidt-decomposed states in the first two lines is expected to be of the same singlet form as Eq. ([\ref=eq:su2_singlet]). Based on the energetic consideration, one expects [formula]. Inspection of the WES shows that [formula] makes negligible contribution to the EE.

A combination of energetic and group-theoretical arguments presented thus far can convince us that SU(2) singlets are formed only if the subsystem size is even. The lowest entanglement spectrum comes from a singlet in this case. For the odd n's where this rule is violated, one notices from Fig. [\ref=fig:su2_ed_dmrg] (c) that all entanglement spectra have the double degeneracy.

SU(3) and SU(4) critical spin chains

The SU(3) analogue of the SU(2) critical spin chain is the Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) model after the authors of three papers that contributed significantly to its Bethe ansatz solution [\cite=uimin] [\cite=lai] [\cite=sutherland]. The Hamiltonian of the SU(3) critical spin chain of length L is written as

[formula]

where [formula] is a collection of eight Gell-Mann matrices. In this section, L = 60 is taken for SU(3) and SU(4) DMRG calculations.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (a) we plot the spectra of the SU(3) CH [formula]. One can readily identify the perfect correspondence in the degeneracy of the spectra of the CH with those of the ES shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (c) for the same n. In Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (b), the EE obtained from DMRG as a function of n is plotted, with a nice CFT fit using cN = 2 and scaling dimension Δ1 = 2 / 3 in Eq. ([\ref=eq:1+1cft]). A period-3 oscillation is clearly observed. The ES shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (c) reveals the three-site alternation well into the bulk. Finally, Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (d) shows the WES as a function of n. As in the SU(2) case, only a small number of entanglement levels contribute significantly to the EE. Distinct patterns of the WES in the bulk still give rise to the similar EE after the summation over the few significant levels. Period-3 oscillations of EE were reported in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain [\cite=solyom07] and SU(3) Hubbard model [\cite=solyom08], but the periodic structure in the ES was overlooked in those studies.

Young tableaux consideration is applicable to the SU(3) chain in accounting for degeneracies in the ES. The ES of the SU(3) chain at n = 1,2,3,4 cuts in Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (c) again correspond to dimensionalities of the SU(3) Young tableaux shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su3]. It must be born in mind that in SU(3) both [formula] (a single tableau) and its conjugate [formula] (two vertically placed tableaux) have the same dimensionality of 3. For sites satisfying mod(n,3) = 0, the SU(3) singlet [formula] and an octet [formula] dominate the WES as seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (d). Readers are referred to the diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su3] (c) for the appearance of [formula] and [formula] when three blocks are pieced together. At the next sites where mod(n,3) = 1, one can refer to the diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su3] (d) to find [formula], among other representations. These three make up most of the EE contributions as one can see from the WES distribution in Fig. [\ref=fig:su3_ed_dmrg] (d) at mod(n,3) = 1. For mod(n,3) = 2 one can easily generate the relevant Young tableaux from combining Figs. [\ref=fig:young_su3] (c) with [\ref=fig:young_su3] (b), which yields representations [formula] among others. They dominate the WES distribution at mod(n,3) = 2 sites with nearly the same WES values as the [formula] at mod(n,3) = 1. In other words, the seemingly identical WES distributions at mod(n,3) = 1 and mod(n,3) = 2 are coming from representations that are conjugate with each other.

A well-known Hamiltonian possessing the SU(4) symmetry is the Kugel-Khomskii model [\cite=KK],

[formula]

In the original physical context, [formula] and [formula] are both Pauli matrices referring to spin and orbital degrees of freedom, respectively. Spin-orbital EE and ES of Kugel-Khomskii model with periodic boundary condition have been studied in Ref. [\cite=rex12], but the main concern in this paper was to examine the boundary effect on quantum entanglement. As noted in Ref. [\cite=KK-su(4)], this model has an equivalent expression

[formula]

in terms of the fifteen gamma matrices [formula] that generate the SU(4) algebra.

Shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:su4_ed_dmrg] (a) are the spectra of the SU(4) CH [formula] consisting of n sites with OBC. The ground state of HSU(4) with 60 sites is obtained by DMRG, and its EE, ES, and WES are plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:su4_ed_dmrg] (b), (c), and (d), respectively. Again the degeneracies of the spectra of the CH and the ES at the same n match well. In Fig. [\ref=fig:su4_ed_dmrg] (b), the EE as a function of n along with (1+1)-dimensional CFT fit is presented with cN = 3 and two scaling dimensions Δ1 = 3 / 4 and Δ2 = 1. The period-4 oscillation in the EE originates from the ES structure shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:su4_ed_dmrg] (c). Only a handful of the ES contribute significantly to the EE as one can see from the inspection of the WES in Fig. [\ref=fig:su4_ed_dmrg] (d). In Ref. [\cite=solyom08], one-dimensional SU(4) Hubbard model has been studied showing the similar EE oscillation, but consideration of ES was absent. Young tableaux consideration as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:young_su4] again nicely account for degeneracies in the ES and the period-4 oscillation.

Corner Hamiltonians and entanglement spectra of integrable models

In the previous two sections the entanglement structures of the SU(N) critical spin chains have been examined in comparison with the spectra of the associated corner Hamiltonians. The one-to-one correspondence in the degeneracy structures of the CS and the ES of the same size n was noted. In this section, we elevate this observation by showing that even the exact level positions match between the two spectra, and that the match occurs for all integrable models, gapped or not, which we were able to examine.

It has been known for quite some time that, in gapped integrable systems, the reduced density matrix for half the system is equivalent to the product of four corner transfer matrices [\cite=nishino97] [\cite=nishino97book],

[formula]

where C denotes the corner transfer matrix (CTM) of the isotropic lattice Hamiltonian [\cite=baxter81] [\cite=baxter]. It was further realized that the generator of the CTM, namely the corner Hamiltonian matrix KCH, can be defined [\cite=davies88] as

[formula]

where κ' is a constant. Therefore the ES is directly connected with CS via

[formula]

where κ  =  4κ'. This connection has been analytically and numerically proven explicitly by Peschel et al. in the transverse Ising model and the XXZ Heisenberg model [\cite=peschel98] away from critical points. However, the connection between the ES and the CS becomes unclear at the critical point because the eigenstates of the CTM are unnormalizable and not well-defined.

Here we claim by numerical means that the correspondence between the CS and the ES holds very well for integrable models on an open chain, regardless of the criticality. Although Eqs. ([\ref=eq:DM=CTM]) and ([\ref=eq:CH-ES_connection]) were proven with mathematical rigor only for semi-infinite systems, our numerical methods can directly compare the spectra of CH of arbitrary finite length n with ES at the cut position n of the ground state of physical Hamiltonian. Quite remarkably, we find a near perfect correspondence in the two spectra for arbitrary n. The length of the chains in the DMRG simulation is 60 throughout this section.

First, consider the transverse Ising model

[formula]

The system is gapped, except for the critical point λ = 1. The corresponding CH was found in Ref. [\cite=davies88] which reads

[formula]

and later the spectra of KTIM for λ = 0.8 and λ = 1.25 have been numerically studied in Ref. [\cite=peschel98]. We can solve Eqs. ([\ref=eq:TIM-H]) and Eq. ([\ref=eq:TIM-K]) by DMRG and exact digonalization, respectively, to obtain the ES of the ground state and the spectra of the CH. Figure [\ref=fig:CH-ES_TIM] shows side-by-side comparisons of the CS and the ES of the TIM, at criticality λ = 1, for the same n∈{4,5,6,7}. Degeneracy of corner (entanglement) spectra is denoted by the number of red (blue) dots on each level throughout the section. In addition to having the same degeneracy structures, the level spacings in both spectra perfectly match after an overall scaling of one of the spectra. The observation of the same level structures in CS and ES are surprising in the sense that the cut position n∈{4,5,6,7} plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:CH-ES_TIM] is near the end of the chain where the boundary effect has to be taken account. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that supports the correspondence between the CH of the arbitrary length n and the ES at the cut position n, especially near the boundary.

Next we turn our attention to spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model,

[formula]

where three integrable points have been found at θ  =  π / 4 (ULS point [\cite=uimin] [\cite=lai] [\cite=sutherland]), θ =  - π / 4 (TB point [\cite=takhtajan] [\cite=babujian]), and θ =  - π / 2 (pure biquadratic (PBQ) point [\cite=parkinson] [\cite=klumper89] [\cite=barber89]). Corresponding corner Hamiltonian is defined as

[formula]

Among the three integrable points, two of them at θ  =    ±  π / 4 (ULS and TB points) are gapless and critical, whereas the third one at θ =  - π / 2 (PBQ point) is gapped.

Shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:CH-ES_blbq] is the phase diagram of spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model, together with comparisons of the exact spectra of Eq. ([\ref=eq:spin-1_CH]) and ES of the ground state of Eq. ([\ref=eq:spin-1_blbq]) with L = 60 at various θ values from - 3π / 4 to π  /  4. Well-established phases of the BLBQ Hamiltonian are denoted inside the phase diagram [\cite=lauchli07]. Level structures of CS and ES at all integrable points, denoted by blue dots on the phase diagram, show the one-to-one correspondence apart from minute differences in level spacing. In particular, θ  =  π / 4 point is the ULS Hamiltonian of SU(3) symmetry already examined in the previous section. Here one can see that not only the degeneracy structure, but the entire level spacings match between the ES and the CS.

In addition to the three integrable points, various other θ values at red- or black-dotted points in Fig. [\ref=fig:CH-ES_blbq] are also examined. Surprisingly at θ≃ - 0.648π, - 0.352π, - 0.148π denoted by red dots on the phase diagram, the correspondence still seems to hold even though those points are away from integrability. The reason for such correspondence could be their proximity to integrable points, although the absence of correspondence at θ≃0.148π, which is close to the ULS point denoted by a black dot, complicates the interpretation. At θ  =   - 3π / 4 where the phase transition occurs between dimer (or arguably from spin nematic [\cite=nematic]) and ferromagnetic phases, the ground states are degenerate due to the crossing of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic energies. To distinguish the ES of ferromagnetic state from that of antiferromagnetic one, θ is deviated by a small amount θ≃ - 3π / 4  ±  0.001. Resulting ES structures for two degenerate ground states at n = 7 are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:CH-ES_blbq] with the absence of correspondence between the CS and the ES. At θ≃0.102π (tan θ  =  1 / 3) one finds the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) Hamiltonian where the ground state can be described by a matrix product state with two virtual degrees of freedom [\cite=AKLT]. The ground states of Eq. ([\ref=eq:spin-1_CH]) in our numerical diagonalization are found to be four-fold degenerate whereas the reduced density eigenvalues upon any bipartition of the AKLT chain are two spin-1/2's giving rise to two-fold degeneracy. Therefore the ES-CS correspondence does not exist at the AKLT point.

Finally, we return to the critical SU(N) spin chain and compare the ES (already shown in the previous sections) with the corner spectra of the Hamiltonian

As one can see in Fig. [\ref=fig:CH-ES_suN], the ES-CS correspondence is nearly perfect for all SU(N) chains at arbitrary cut n (only n = 6,7 are shown for clarity) we examined.

summary and discussion

This paper provides a dense assortment of information regarding the entanglement structure of critical SU(N) spin chains and other integrable models in one dimension. The most interesting aspect of this investigation, in our opinion, is the robust correspondence found in the entanglement spectra with the spectra of the corner Hamiltonian found to hold for all integrable models we examine. In some sense our findings may have been anticipated from earlier works [\cite=nishino96] [\cite=nishino97] [\cite=nishino97book] [\cite=peschel98] but no detailed comparison of the two spectra has been reported to date.

Period-N oscillations in the entanglement structure of the SU(N) critical spin chain is re-examined from the perspective of the site dependence of the entanglement spectra. A surprising feature of our DMRG investigation, that was probably unexpected by earlier studies focusing only on the entanglement entropy oscillation, is that the entanglement spectra continues to retain the periodic structure in the bulk where the EE itself has diminishing oscillation amplitudes. We can understand this seeming mismatch by examining the behavior of the weighted entanglement spectra. In WES only a handful of entanglement spectra contribute meaningfully to the entropy, and quite different WES patterns realized at different sites can still give rise to the same sum, which is the entanglement entropy. The degeneracies of the ES (and WES) are naturally understood in terms of the Young tableaux construction. Furthermore, the same degeneracy structure is found in the spectra of the CH. Based on our numerical observations, the challenge for future mathematical analysis of the entanglement properties of the SU(N) critical spin model can be summarized as follows. First, one needs to understand the persistence of the periodic structure of the ES deep inside the bulk. Typically, all boundary effects die off as a power law in a critical system and the EE behaves in just such a way as the scaling analysis has confirmed. The counter-intuitive behavior of the ES we have seen here awaits some theoretical understanding. The one-to-one match in the degeneracy of the ES and of the spectra of the CH also call for a theoretical explanation. It is not easy to speculate on the origin of the period-N oscillation of the critical SU(N) chain. From the gapless excitations of the critical system it is natural anticipate a boundary correction that decays as a power-law, while our converged DMRG wave function of the matrix product form clearly maintains a period-N structure down to the bulk of the chain. Furthermore, the critical point of the transverse Ising model did not exhibit any oscillations in the entanglement spectra, which points to the fact that gaplessness alone cannot account for the oscillation. We might note in passing that the Young tableaux counting only works for SU(N) models and not for transverse Ising models, and thus speculate that the oscillation might be tied to the large SU(N) symmetry, absent in the critical transverse Ising model, in some ways.
