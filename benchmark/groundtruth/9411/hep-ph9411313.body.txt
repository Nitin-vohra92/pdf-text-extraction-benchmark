Electroweak Condensates at Standard Top Mass Values

DESY-IfH, Platanenallee 6, D-15738 Zeuthen, Germany

Top condensate models have been motivated a few years ago when the top mass [formula] became known to be as heavy as 60 or 70 GeV [\cite=Nambu]. With such masses, top is the only elementary fermion with mtop / MW  =  O(1) and this - rather than the fact that the top is heavier than all remaining eleven fermions together - is what makes the top quark special: the dynamics of mtop and MW must be related. The minimal, effective model replaces the standard Higgs-sector by an NJL interaction involving t and bL,

[formula]

which gives rise to a composite σ-model if G > Gc = 8π2 / N. The scalar states are a massive t and massless γ5t, LtR, LbR. The top has no bare mass term and achieves a dynamical one via a self-consistent Schwinger-Dyson summation.

Because we now have growing evidence for mtop≃174 GeV from CDF [\cite=CDF], it is useful to take a fresh look on this well motivated kind of model under the assumption

[formula]

It will be useful to follow the discussion of the model like it proceeded in the major part of the literature within the last 5 years, because the model variations left first statements mainly intact and numerical changes of predictions can be derived directly from the extension or variation under consideration. The result will be that all such numerical changes are small for viable parameter ranges, i.e. the prediction of the minimal model is (maybe surprisingly) stable in extensions. What has often been regarded as a failure to construct models with the correct mtop prediction now turns out to be a confirmation of the two composite Higgs-doublet case: Models with one Higgs-doublet predict mtop  >  200GeV, while a two Higgs-doublet model predicts mtop in the range ([\ref=topass]) with a condensation scale possibly as low as a few TeV.

The pure NJL prediction is given by the relation mH = 2mtop, but SU(3)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1) gauge interactions must be included. They have been accounted for in solving the SM RG-equation for gtop with the boundary condition gtop(μ  →  Λc)  →    ∞  , where Λc is the condensation scale at which the composite scalar field t  =  Z(μ)φ0 vanishes with Z = g0top / gtop [\cite=bhl]. This is practically the same as considering the running of gtop in the minimal SM itself and looking for the Landau pole. The use of 1-loop RG-equations in this procedure is believed to be a meaningful approximation, because the breakdown of perturbativity takes place not too far below ΛPlanck [\cite=Kim+Cvetic] and numerical calculations support the results [\cite=Carena+Wagner]. It is well-known that in the minimal model, mtop comes out too large: values are above the window allowed by the ρ-parameter even for very highly tuned Λc  >  1016 GeV. This is saying that the pole is not reached before ΛPlanck if mtop  <  200 GeV. Thus we are confronted with an extreme (and in fact a worse case) of the unnatural Standard desert situation, as all quadratic divergencies have only been absorbed into the top mass counterterm.

The situation drastically changes, if the scalar sector possesses two doublets: the vev's of up- and down-type Yukawa couplings add up in the W self-energy and therefore have to satisfy v2  =  v2u  +  v2d. This simply causes a lower v to enter the fermion mass [formula] so that gf has to be fitted to a higher value. The influence can be read off best from table 1 by Kim and Cvetic [\cite=Kim+Cvetic]. For values ([\ref=topass]) the breakdown is then reached at comfortable scales 1-1000 TeV, if vu / vd  <  1. Such ratios enhance the running of gtop. The same was found in the supersymmetric version of the TMSM [\cite=susy], where the second doublet and quadratic divergencies appear in a different context.

The second serious objection against the minimal TMSM, put forward mainly by A. Hasenfratz et al., concerned predictability [\cite=universality]: The pure effective NJL terms induce all sorts of higher dimensional counterterms. Among them are derivative couplings, which correspond to momentum dependent loop diagrams like Fig.1, [\cite=Suzuki]. These terms represent the propagation of the bound state (the internal loop) and inclusion of the complete series of derivative couplings, each with a free coefficient, leads back to the SM universality class. Having this critics only qualitatively in mind, gauge interactions were used to yield the NJL operator on the Fermi scale as a well-defined part of a complete gauge boson exchange: The new parameters are a gauge coupling gnew, a degree of freedom N to expand in and a new scale Λc  ≪  ΛPlanck, all of which have definite physical meaning, such that we now gain information on physics beyond the SM out of the composite Yukawa sector [\cite=Bonisch]. Higher dimensional terms are calculable and small for viable ranges of Λc (second ref. [\cite=gauge]).

The gauge extension causes deviations from the pure NJL prediction and we want to classify the new effects in a model-independent way as far as possible. The new boson(s) shall be strongly coupled and heavy. It is useful to expand the new interaction in powers of p2 / M2, where M  ~  Λc is the new mass and p a typical momentum and write the complete form as:

Here we can see that the model is not in one universality class with the SM: J2L(R) and O(p2 / M2) are new terms which cannot be decoupled from weak physics, because tuning the new physics to scales Λc  ≫  MW must keep MW itself fixed. This can only be done by simultaneously tuning GLR  →  Gc and this takes place in every channel of eq. ([\ref=full]) as GLR  ~  GLL(RR). Additional predictions from these additional operators will remain at low energies and there is no way to reach the minimal SM as a limit. Let us now recall the known results from those non-minimal predictions/effects, beginning with ρ:

The Fierz-eigenstates J2L and J2R contribute to the bubble summation which corrects ρ, Fig. 2. They have been calculated to O(1 / N) for p2 = 0 and found to be negligible [\cite=Bonisch+Kneur].

The next important part that contributes to ρ is the vector resonance spectrum. It is of course completely model-dependent and constitutes the yet unknown part of new effects in ρ. Vector resonances will show non-decoupling as discussed above. On the other hand, one expects these resonances to be uncritical, i.e. although the tuning enters in the corresponding channel, divergencies remain as no gap-equation automatically removes them. Therefore they shall be of O(Λc) and the decoupling takes place for this mass to suppress the influence on observables at low energies (like especially ρ(0)).

Using a dynamical function Σtop(p2) in the W-self-energy, A. Blumhofer and M. Lindner argued that a cancelation of the SM m2top term in ρ can take place if Σtop has some kind of resonant enhancement at ~  5mtop [\cite=Lindner+Blumhofer].

A further effect comes from O(p2 / M2) terms in eq.([\ref=full]). They represent the p-dependent short distance parts of the propagator of new bosons and thus easily cause additional resonances (radial excitations of composite states). M. Lindner and D. Lüst have considered additional scalars and vectors in the SM-RG-eq. [\cite=Lindner+Luest]. The running of gtop is altered by a change of slope at the scale of the resonance. Additional scalars (vectors) result in a decreasing (increasing) mtop and one additional scalar at 100 GeV in the otherwise minimal SM for example allows mtop  <  200 GeV at Λc  ~  1011 GeV. Altogether, the O(p2 / M2) terms do not drastically change predictions if not a number of scalars form around MW. This requires M to be of O(MW), a too low value.

In all these examples above non-standard effects are sizeable only if [formula] 1 TeV. The analysis of non-standard pT in t production has not been shown to give a different result [\cite=Hill]. We should now look for lower bounds on M.

A [formula] mass is of course limited already in precision measurements. Perturbative bosons are usually bounded to be heavier than a few hundred GeV, depending on the details of the model which give the physical couplings of the various precisely measured channel [\cite=zpr]. For a strongly coupled [formula], the limit depends on the effective fermionic coupling g2new = G of [formula], which has to exceed the critical coupling 8π2 / N. The limit thus depends on N. A strong coupling at LEP100, assuming N = 3, gives a typical limit [formula] 3 TeV [\cite=Bonisch+Leike], Fig. 3. If no new bosons are found at LEP200 or a 500 GeV e+e- collider, the limit increases to 15 TeV and 50 TeV respectively, Fig. 4. This analysis uses a static coupling and correct running of gnew in the critical channels can cause drastic changes, non-critical channels will however remain to be strong at low energies.

Collecting the above points, we see that i) augmenting the interaction eq.([\ref=bhl]) to eq.([\ref=full]) does not significantly effect the result of the pure NJL gap-equation or standard RG-running unless [formula] 1 TeV and ii) such scales seem rather unlikely from experiment already. Turning this around, the NJL-RG prediction is rather stable to hold in a gauge extension at an expected

[formula]

This disfavors the one Higgs-doublet model under the assumption ([\ref=topass]), while the two doublet model can live well with ([\ref=topass]) and ([\ref=1tev]): A lack of non-standard negative contributions to low energy observables like ρ in this scenarios preserves indirect measurements of mtop to contradict with the NJL-RG result (table 1).

Let us make a remark on a previously proposed type of model. The empirical scaling formula for masses mi across flavor components i = 1,2,3, [formula], [\cite=Sirlin], tells us that Q can be used for the mass splitting. The most straightforward way to involve Q in the top condensate model is to couple the new boson to hypercharge currents by mixing in SU(2)R or any other hidden factor of the SM [\cite=Schildknecht] [\cite=Bonisch]. The scalar couplings GLR, relevant in the SD-eq., are proportional to

[formula]

The mass matrix is of rank 1 in generation space. According to eq. ([\ref=quarkhier]) only I =  + 1 / 2 quarks condense, while the interaction is repulsive for I =  - 1 / 2 quarks, i.e. interaction eq. ([\ref=bhl]) is recovered and only the top is massive. There is an analogous term for the leptons, LτRRΨL,    Ψ = (ντ,τ)T, which among leptons produces only a mass for the τ. This channel is stronger than the top-bottom system, [formula], for IW3 =  - 1 / 2 leptons, possibly leading to the required situation vu  /  vd < 1. Additionally, there is one more attractive channel involving bR and (ντ,τ)L, intermediate in strength and giving rise to a system of coupled gap-equations, which has not been considered yet. A generalization of the representation was introduced in [\cite=Bonisch2].

We note that there is further work on condensate type models, both without the derivation of new interactions [\cite=Gribov] or scenarios like the inclusion of a 4th family [\cite=4th] and other variations, which do not fall into special classes of models (see [\cite=gauge] and further refs. therein). I wish to thank S. T. Pokorski and Z. Ajduk for the kind invitation to and hospitality at the Kazimierz meeting and the Organizing Committee in Zvenigorod very much for the kind arrangements that made the visit a real pleasure.
