Abstract

In order to investigate to what extent string theories are different vacua of a general string theory (the "universal string"), we discuss realizations of the bosonic string as particular background of certain types of W-strings. Our discussions include linearized Wlin3, non-critical W3, linearized W(2)lin3 and critical W(2)3 realizations of the bosonic string.

Introduction

Along the line of realization of various string theories in those with higher worldsheet gauge symmetries [\cite=R], those based on nonlinear algebras seem to belong to a very special class. The nonlinear character of these algebras makes it difficult to construct embeddings, and up to now only few special realizations have been discovered for the case of the bosonic string embedded in the W-strings [\cite=W] [\cite=KST] [\cite=BBR]. It would be quite interesting to examine further such realizations with the aim of finding general methods to describe embeddings. Our motivations arise from investigating to what extent string theories can be viewed as different vacua of a general string theory (the "universal string"). In this note we will present a few remarks and a few additional realizations of the bosonic string as particular background of certain types of W-strings. Our main idea is to use linearized versions of the W-algebras to find embeddings and to map these embeddings back to the nonlinear basis of the algebra. We could find embeddings for the linearized version of the W-algebras and prove their equivalence to the bosonic string, but we encountered technical difficulties in proving the equivalence in the nonlinear cases.

Wlin3 realization of the bosonic string

An interesting approach to realize embeddings of the various string theories into those based on nonlinear algebras is to consider the linearization of these nonlinear algebras by including additional symmetry generators and performing nonlinear redefinitions of the generators. Recently Krivonos and Sorin [\cite=KS] have constructed a linearized version of the W3 algebra, which is denoted by Wlin3 and is given by

[formula]

where the central charge c and the coefficients x1,x2 are parametrized by

[formula]

An invertible nonlinear transformation maps this algebra into the usual nonlinear W3 algebra extended by a spin 1 current. Such an extended W3 algebra, which we will call W3,1, is unique if one requires to preserve the usual W3 algebra as subalgebra. This was discussed in ref. [\cite=KS], to which we refer for the complete OPE of the W3,1 algebra. In this section we will show how the bosonic string can be realized as a special case of the more general string that can be constructed by gauging the Wlin3 algebra.

First we construct the BRST charge for the Wlin3 algebra. It is given by

[formula]

with the ghost correlators given by

[formula]

It is nilpotent for x =  - 2. This value implies [formula]. Note that the current G acquires spin [formula] at the critical value x =  - 2, but it still has even Grassman parity.

Now we show that the bosonic string can be embedded into the more general string based on the Wlin3 algebra. Consider a consistent bosonic string background described by a conformal field theory with stress tensor Tm satisfying the Virasoro algebra with central charge c = 26. Tensoring it with a set of two commuting bc systems, (βg,γg), (βj,γj) of spin [formula], (1,0), respectively, one can construct the following realization of the critical Wlin3 algebra

[formula]

where we denote by T(b,c) the stress tensor of a (b,c) system of spin (λ,1  -  λ)

[formula]

Plugging the particular realization ([\ref=rea]) into eq. ([\ref=brst]), we get the following nilpotent BRST charge

[formula]

It is canonically equivalent to the BRST charge of the bosonic string plus a sector of non-minimal terms which decouples and has trivial cohomology. In fact one can check that

[formula]

where Qbos is the BRST of the usual bosonic string

[formula]

and where

[formula]

The topological charge Qnm imposes the constraint that the fields (βg,γg,bg,cg) as well as (βj,γj,bj,cj) make quartets and decouple from the theory. Thus the bosonic string is realized as a particular background of the Wlin3-string.

Finding quadratic W3

The realization ([\ref=rea]) can be used to find a realization of nonlinear W3 as follows. Define the generators

[formula]

where T,G,J are given in ([\ref=rea]). One may verify that the generators (TW,W,J) realize a representation of the W3,1 algebra with the correct amount of central charge (c = 102) expected to balance the ghost contribution. Thus one may conjecture that it defines a critical realization of the W3,1 algebra. However to prove such a conjecture one has to construct the BRST charge for W3,1 and verify that the above realization makes it nilpotent. The construction of such a BRST charge is tedious because the algebra closes with cubic relations and it is not discussed here.

An intriguing alternative is to notice that (TW,W) in ([\ref=realw]) satisfy the W3 OPE with central charge c = 102. This realization is interesting in that the generator W contains a linear term βg, indicating the spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry. This is quite different from the realizations discussed in refs. [\cite=W] [\cite=BBR], in which there is a linear term but with derivatives. However the algebra satisfied by these generators has the non-critical central charge c = 102 and we have the "extra" matter βj,γj. One can still define a nilpotent BRST operator by coupling the W3 matter system described by (TW,W) to a "Liouville" system à la ref. [\cite=NON]. For this purpose, we need a W3 realization with central charge c =  - 2 as a "Liouville" system. We find that

[formula]

satisfy the W3 algebra with c =  - 2, where (ηL,ξL) are anticommuting fields. Using this realization, the nilpotent BRST operator is given by

[formula]

Since we have the linear term βg in W which can be used to decouple (βg,γg,bw,cw) as in the superstrings [\cite=R], we expect that this model contains the bosonic string as a subsector without states from these fields. Unfortunately a constraint that would eliminate the fields (ηL,ξL,βj,γj) does not seem to be present in the BRST charge, so it may be that additional states are present, as in the model of ref. [\cite=BBR] where a construction reminiscent of ours has been presented. It would be interesting to examine the full cohomology of eq. ([\ref=3.3]).

Before closing this section, we would like to note that eq. ([\ref=realw]) suggests that it may be possible to find a critical realization using only (βg,γg) with a linear βg term in W, unlike that of refs. [\cite=W] [\cite=BBR]. However terms like ∂2γg having zero dimension can appear with an arbitrary power, making it harder to proceed systematically in the construction of the generators. For example, a possible method to find such a realization is to use an expansion in ghost number as in ref. [\cite=BO]. Namely we assign ghost number - 1 to βg and 1 to γg, and assume the following form

[formula]

Then one can try to satisfy the OPE for W3 at each ghost number. Unfortunately the calculation involves increasingly large number of terms for increasing ghost numbers and it seems difficult to construct a realization in this way.

W(2)lin3 realization of the bosonic string

In ref. [\cite=KS] another nonlinear algebra W(2)3 [\cite=B] was also linearized. The linearized version, called W(2)lin3, is given by

[formula]

The standard procedure for constructing the BRST operator fails to give a nilpotent BRST charge. This is presumably related to the fact that not all possible central charges compatible with the Jacobi identities are present in the OPE ([\ref=w23]). In fact one can write down all possible central charges (c,c1,c2,c3,x,x1) that can appear by dimensional analysis

[formula]

Then the standard BRST charge

[formula]

is nilpotent for c = 61, c1 = 2, x =  - 3 and x1 = c2 = c3 = 0. In general these central charges are not all independent and should be fixed by the Jacobi identities. Since we are only interested in the critical algebra, we have not worked out all the relations arising from Jacobi identities. It is enough to know that the nilpotency of the BRST charge guarantees that the Jacobi identities are satisfied for the critical algebra, for which we will indeed find an explicit realization.

The bosonic string can be embedded in the string described by the algebra ([\ref=4.2]) by introducing, along with a consistent bosonic string background given by the stress tensor Tm, four commuting bc systems (β+,γ+), (β-,γ-), (βk,γk), (βj,γj) of spin [formula], [formula] [formula], (1,0), respectively. The generators

[formula]

realize the critical algebra ([\ref=4.2]). Plugging this realization in eq. ([\ref=4.3]), we obtain a BRST charge [formula] that is canonically equivalent to the BRST charge of the bosonic string Qbos plus a sector of non-minimal terms which decouples and carries trivial cohomology. In fact one can check that

[formula]

where

[formula]

One problem with this construction is that the nilpotency of the BRST charge ([\ref=4.3]) requires x1 = 0, but this must be non-vanishing in order to reproduce the W(2)3 algebra as a subalgebra of ([\ref=4.2]). Another approach that allows to construct a nilpotent operator from the algebra ([\ref=w23]) and avoids this problem is that of introducing an additional commuting (β,γ) system of spin [formula] so that

[formula]

is nilpotent for x =  - 2 or central charge c = 50. Note that the first two lines of eq. ([\ref=brst2]) give the charge naively expected which however is not nilpotent. Actually this approach is just a reinterpretation of the previous one. We can read off the total matter generators by taking anticommutators of ([\ref=brst2]) with the respective ghosts and dropping the ghost part. We find

[formula]

We see that these are modified by β,γ such that they satisfy the critical algebra ([\ref=4.2]). This suggests that the generators G- and K should be spontaneously broken because the total generators G - ' and K' contain linear terms. It is also possible to eliminate c-,b-,β,γ, at the cost of redefining the generators. The BRST charge ([\ref=brst2]) can be transformed as

[formula]

where

[formula]

The last term in eq. ([\ref=brst3]) implies that the four fields (b-,c-,β,γ) make a quartet and decouple from the theory. The generators corresponding to G-,K obtained from ([\ref=brst3]) by the anticommutators with b-,bk decouple from the rest of the generators. This is an implementation through similarity transformations of the procedure of eliminating G-,K by redefinitions given in ref. [\cite=KS].

We can find a realization of the algebra ([\ref=w23]) for x =  - 2, which is given by

[formula]

Now we can show the equivalence to bosonic string. The BRST charge ([\ref=brst2]) with eq. ([\ref=rea2]) substituted in can be transformed as

[formula]

where Qbos is that for the bosonic string given in eq. ([\ref=bosbrst]) and Qnm is that for the non-minimal sector

[formula]

and where

[formula]

Again the non-minimal term imposes the condition that all fields except those in the original bosonic string decouple from the physical subspace and the theory is equivalent to the bosonic string.

W(2)3 realization of the bosonic string

The unorthodox way of constructing a nilpotent BRST charge for the linear algebra in eq. ([\ref=w23]), presented in the second part of the previous paragraph, gives us a hint on how to obtain a realization of the bosonic string as a particular background for the nonlinear W(2)3-string. To show this, we first note that the W(2)3 BRST charge [\cite=Khvi] is given by

[formula]

where the spin [formula] generator Ĝ+ is given by the nonlinear redefinition of Krivonos and Sorin [\cite=KS]

[formula]

such that (T,Ĝ+,G-,J) constitute a W(2)3 algebra. We find that the nilpotency condition for this charge is precisely x =  - 2 or c = 50. Hence substituting the critical realization given in eq. ([\ref=rea2]), we get an embedding of the bosonic string. The conjecture that this BRST charge is canonically equivalent to that of the bosonic string plus a sector of non-minimal fields may be proved by performing similarity transformations, but we have not been able to find the set of transformations that does the job.

Conclusions

We have presented a few realizations of the bosonic string as a background for some W-strings and discussed their properties. We have used linearized versions of the W-algebras to identify the embeddings. For the W3 case we have obtained a non-critical realization. Adding to it a "Liouville" system to obtain criticality we have achieved a critical embedding. However the resulting theory presumably contains additional states on top of those present in the bosonic string. In fact a full equivalence could not be established. In the W(2)3 case the linearized embedding has helped us to identify a consistent background for the W(2)3-string that might reproduce the full structure of the bosonic string without additional states. Thus the W(2)3 case seems to be simpler than the W3 case in that we could identify a critical embedding. However we have not found the correct similarity transformation that proves the complete equivalence, even though we suspect this should be possible. The W3 and W(2)3 algebras are closely related. In fact W-algebras can generically be derived as hamiltonian reduction of WZNW models, and the specific case of the W3 and W(2)3 algebras correspond to different embedding of sl(2) into sl(3) [\cite=BTD]. Perhaps the method of hamiltonian reduction could be successfully used in the search for a "universal string".
