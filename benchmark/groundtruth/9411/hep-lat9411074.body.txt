The static critical phenomena are well understood in simple models and their properties can be calculated. However, the knowledge of the time-dependence properties [\cite=h] is not in the same stage. The various dynamical exponents for relaxation times, have not been related to the static exponents or calculated exactly even in the 2D Ising model. Several kinds of analytical treatments (mainly for local classes of dynamics) such as: dynamic Monte Carlo RG [\cite=1] [\cite=stauf], high temperature series expansion [\cite=2] and ε expansion [\cite=h], have been employed in order to resolve this problem. Others tried to estimate z using general theoretical approaches, such as the recent Alexandrowicz conjecture [\cite=4], which expresses z as a combination of the usual static critical exponents and a new geometric exponent. Taking the 2D Ising model with one of its local dynamics, as a simple example, one finds a wide range of theoretical and numerical estimates for z (for a review and a list of references see [\cite=1]). The values quoted there range from 1.82 to 2.24; so, although it seem that the value around 2.05 - 2.2 has a wide agreement, we can safely state that there is no consensus in this issue (the latest result [\cite=tatata] is 2.163(6) ).

From the practical point of view, z has a significant importance as well. In order to get a sample of independent measurements one must wait until the the system decorrelate from measurement to measurement. In many situations, especially near criticality, this takes a long time. This Critical Slowing Down (CSD) [\cite=h] phenomenon is one of the important subjects one has to deal with while developing Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms. In the last decade a family of new "global" dynamics that overcome (at least partially) the CSD, was developed [\cite=SW] [\cite=D] [\cite=W] [\cite=R]. The basic idea of the global methods is the ability to work on 'the relevant degrees of freedom'. This concept, is now used in a wide range of applications (for recent surveys see [\cite=5]). Numerically it was shown that those dynamics are not in the universality class of the local dynamics, (such as Metropolis or heat-bath), and their z's may differ. Since the key to improve the efficiency of the dynamics is reducing the autocorrelation, estimation of the proper z is a crucial tool. However, the value of the dynamical critical exponent in those dynamics is not well understood, and in fact only the lower bound has been obtained analytically in some cases [\cite=socal].

Measuring z is a difficult task, a review of common problems and difficulties can be found in refs. [\cite=1] [\cite=6]. Although the usual definition of z is : [formula], in practice, due to technical problems, other ways of calculating z are usually preferred. Many standard methods for measuring z, involve repeating the measurements of τ for various lattices with different linear sizes, L. Then, using finite-size arguments one deduces z from the relation [formula] [\cite=7]. One of the problems with those methods is the dependence of the critical temperature on L.

The main idea of this letter, is that a system at criticality contains all the possible time and length scales. Studying the internal relations between the spatial and the time scales in one system, would yield the desired knowledge on the dynamical properties. following [\cite=bb], we define the elements of the autocorrelation matrix to be:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are points on the lattice (e.g in the 2-D lattice [formula] ), and [formula] is any local observable (e.g. the spin at the point [formula]). In the case of a translation invariant dynamics one has:

[formula]

where [formula] is any lattice vector. Thus, one can identify the eigenvectors of the autocorrelation matrix as Fourier modes. Each eigenvalue [formula] corresponding to the eigenvector ei  ·   satisfies:

[formula]

For each wave-vector [formula] one can assign a decorrelation time [formula] via:

[formula]

Note that for instance, in the spin case, [formula] (τ for [formula] is identical to the usually defined exponential autocorrelation time for the magnetization.

Measuring the decay of the eigenvalue, [formula], we estimate zmd assuming the dynamical RG [\cite=ma] scaling relation:

[formula]

where k denotes the norm of [formula]. The reason for this assumption is that the corresponding length scale of a Fourier mode is: [formula]. Therefore assuming dynamical universality one expects that [formula].

The LAG Algorithm The measurement of a dynamical observable associated with an algorithm with local dynamics, just as any measurement of a static property, suffers from CSD. Namely, even in the measurements of the CSD itself, one has to wait a long time, in order to avoid correlations between successive measurements of the autocorrelation matrix M(t). To overcome this difficulty we introduce the "Local After Global" (LAG) technique. The LAG combines a global dynamics (GD) (which does not suffer from CSD) with a local dynamics (LD) such that the LD is used only when it is needed for measurements. More precisely, first we relax the system with GD then we preform LD steps as much as needed to have one measurement of the dynamical observable (in our case M(t)), then we preform again a few steps of GD in order to decorrelate the system, then again the LD steps and so on. In figure 1, we illustrate this procedure.

The Simulation. -  The model in which we preformed our simulation is the 2D Ising on a square lattice [\cite=IS]. We measured the autocorrelation eigenvalues for both a GD (cluster) [\cite=W] and a LD (Parallel Checkboard Metropolis (PCM)[\cite=note]) algorithm. The lattice linear sizes were L=64,128 [\cite=note2], and the temperature was [formula]. In the PCM case we employed the cluster dynamics to relax and to decorrelate the system according to the rules of the LAG procedure. In both cases we had periodic boundary conditions. In the cluster dynamics since the sites are randomly accessed, the translation invariance of the dynamics is guaranteed. In order to have translation invariance in the PCM as well, we define a block-spin variables which is the sum of the spins on the four sites of a 2×  2 square sub-lattice. In both cases we discard the first 10,000 cluster sweeps and then took [formula] different measurements of the autocorrelation matrix, with ten cluster sweeps between each measurement. The translation invariance allows us to limit the actual computation to only one line of the autocorrelation matrix in each dimension. The reflection symmetry further reduces the actual necessary measurements to almost half of a line in each dimension. Altogether one has to measure only (L / 4 + 1)2 elements. The other parts of the matrix are actually, reflections and cyclic permutations of this 'quarter line'. In practice at every step of a M,(t) measurement, we made a spatial average by measuring the matrix element for every one of 4 (16 for L=128) spin-blocks, and then average over all the measurements. We repeated this process for 10 independent systems and estimated the error bars by the standard deviation. In order to estimate [formula] we fit the exponential in eq. (4), and in order to deduce zmd we fit to the power law eq. (5). The fits were done using nonlinear least square [\cite=9] which gives the error bars as well.

In figures 2 and 3 one can see a log-log plot of [formula], and the evaluated z for the Metropolis and cluster dynamics, respectively. In order to avoid transients in the calculation of [formula] we waited until the momentary [formula] had been reasonably stabilized. The final results of our fitting are [formula], [formula], for L=64, and [formula], [formula], for L=128.

Note the shift in emphasis compared with the usual technique for measuring dynamical critical exponents. While usually, the main measurement is on the total magnetization and its time evolution ([formula]), in our case we discard the low values of [formula] as finite-size artifacts. Incidentally these values are also the most demanding in terms of running times.

Instead, the explicit simultaneous measurement of all the scales below the maximal scale in the system allows one to obtain the z value within a highly self-consistent measurement. The quite precise linearity of the the graphs 2 and 3 verifies the consistency of the z values prevailing at the various scales within the system.

As L  →    ∞   the range of dynamically active scales within the system extends to infinity and in fact this produces a power law.

In this letter we introduced a new method to investigate the internal relations between the spatial and the time scales in statistical models, and showed that the the dynamical RG ideas can be implemented practically. The results in the 2D Ising model confirmed that the Dynamical RG assumption for the scaling relation [formula] holds both for the Metropolis and the cluster dynamics, suggesting that it does not depend on the particular kind of dynamics. Let us emphasize that our method does not require runs at several ξ's (corresponding to different temperatures) or at several lattice sizes L: we perform all the measurements relevant for all scales at fixed temperature and fixed lattice size.

One should note that each Fourier subspace contains a set of many τ's. That is the [formula] can be Laplace or Fourier transformed [\cite=fu] or directly be fitted [\cite=2exp], to be a linear combination of many decay-times. However in our case we took the lowest mode in each k subspace and these lowest modes produced a power law consistent with the dynamical universality assumption. One can go farther and use our method to analyze the internal structure of the Fourier subspaces as well as seeing the correspondence between them.

In addition, we presented an efficient tool to analyze dynamical properties without suffering from CSD. The LAG technique combines the dynamics which one wants to analyze, with a global dynamics used to decorrelate the system. Using GD to decorrelate the system is of great importance even when the main target of the simulation is the properties of the local dynamics. The relevance of LAG technique goes beyond the objectives of the present letter and we intend to exploit it in the future, in a wider range of applications.

Finally, we want to report on an interesting short time scales property of autocorrelation functions. On long time scales the autocorrelation function is convex, and it is customary to expect that this property holds in general. A sufficient condition for convexity is an existence of spectral representation of the dynamic process. Indeed, in many classes of dynamics this is actually the case. In fact, in those dynamics which satisfy detailed balance, the corresponding transition matrix is symmetric in the Hilbert space l2(Peq) [\cite=socal2], namely the Hilbert space with the measure (weight) Peq, the unique stationary distribution. Therefore the spectral representation, and consequently the convexity are guaranteed. On contrary, in dynamics which do not satisfy detailed balance such as 'typewrite order' Metropolis, the convexity is not guaranteed. In fact, in a few types of dynamics we were able to detect at short times non convex behavior of the autocorrelation function. The convexity holds only after few steps. We discuss this result elsewhere [\cite=np].
