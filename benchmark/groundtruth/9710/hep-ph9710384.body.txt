Sudakov Form Factors in Leptoproduction of Vector Mesons I.M. Dremin Lebedev Physical Institute, 117924 Moscow, Russia

The idea of inelastic diffraction goes back to the papers of I.Ya. Pomeranchuk and E.L. Feinberg [\cite=pf]. The particular example is provided by the diffraction dissociation of a virtual photon to any vector meson on a nuclear target. Recently, the processes of diffractive leptoproduction of vector mesons in interactions of high energy electrons and muons with nucleons and nuclei were intensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The most popular approach to the problem of their description is provided by a model inspired by ideas of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where the exchanged photon with the four-momentum squared (the virtuality) Q2 is treated as a quark-antiquark pair which interacts with a target nucleon by the two-gluon exchange [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. Correspondingly, in the simplest approximation the diffractive cross section of "elastic" leptoproduction of vector mesons is defined by a product of wave functions of the virtual photon and of the vector meson with the amplitude of elastic scattering of the quark-antiquark dipole off the nucleon.

This factorization model becomes valid at high energies because, due to the Lorentz transformation, those longitudinal distances at which the photon separates as the colour dipole (and, later, this dipole transforms into the vector meson) exceed strongly the range of distances of the intermediate interaction of the dipole with the target nucleon. That is why the whole process can be treated as if separated into three independent stages. First, long before its contact with the target nucleon, the virtual photon forms the quark-antiquark component of its wave function. At the second stage, the scattering of this colour dipole on the target takes place during the rather short time when the transverse size of the dipole does not change much. This subprocess used to be described by the two-gluon exchange at high energies. Finally, at the third stage, the vector meson is formed by the quark-antiquark pair, and it takes long time comparable with the initial stage of formation of the quark-antiquark pair from the virtual photon.

However, after writing down the leptoproduction matrix element as a product of the wave functions and of the dipole cross section (inserted in place of the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude) one has to solve a problem of ascribing definite expressions to all the terms in the product. Usually, the cross section is represented either by the formulae obtained in the leading-logarithmic approximation of the perturbative QCD (and replaced sometimes by some suitable fits) or by the expressions rooted in the reggeon approach. The wave functions of vector mesons are described by different semiphenomenological forms.

The band of undefiniteness due to the assumptions of such a kind has been studied in Ref. [\cite=3]. It has been shown that they give rise to the factors about 2 or 3 in the forward differential cross section of the leptoproduction, and consequently to the same factors in its total cross section which differs from above characteristics by the diffraction cone slope only.

In the paper [\cite=4] it has been demonstrated that the similar factors can appear due to the additional rescattering of the quark-antiquark pair on the nucleon giving rise to the shadowing corrections to the initial expressions. The rescattering of the colour dipole was considered in Ref. [\cite=4] as mediated by the exchange of the ladder-type graphs taking into account the gluon distribution within the nucleon. All terms of that kind have been summed up. Suppression effects increasing with Q2 have been claimed.

Corrections due to quark Fermi motion within produced vector mesons were considered in the paper [\cite=fks].

However, up to now nobody took into account that due to the exclusive nature of the process of leptoproduction of vector mesons one must consider its suppression by Sudakov form factors. Physical origin of this effect consists in the requirement of prohibition of any emission of additional "free" gluons (gluon jets) during the whole process of the conversion of the virtual photon into the vector meson. Otherwise, we would have to deal with inelastic processes of a more general type. In other words it can be formulated as the requirement to deal with those components of the quark-antiquark pair plus one or several gluons which form the Fock column of the bound state and have no "free" gluon jets since the last ones would correspond to the processes not considered here. The reason for such a neglect of this effect is rooted probably in the necessity to use expressions for Sudakov form factors of the quark-antiquark dipoles (yet not very widely known) instead of the famous double-logarithmic formulae for form factors of single quarks. However the corresponding formulae for the colour dipole were obtained rather long time ago in the paper [\cite=5] where they were used for exclusive processes of elastic meson-meson and baryon-baryon scattering at high energies.

The aim of the present paper is to reveal the role of Sudakov form factors of quark-antiquark dipoles in suppression of the cross section of leptoproduction of vector mesons. We shall show that the corresponding damping factors are larger than other corrections discussed above. Here we shall consider the simplest analytical estimates leaving detailed computer calculations for a more complete subsequent publication.

The ratio R of the cross section values with and without Sudakov form factors in the model under consideration is given by

[formula]

Here ψγ* and ψV are the wave functions of the virtual photon and of any possible vector meson, correspondingly, σ is the cross section of interaction of the colour dipole of the transverse size ρ with the target nucleon, S describes Sudakov suppression for the colour dipole, z is the share of energy of the virtual photon carried by the quark (the antiquark share of energy is equal to 1 - z, correspondingly). The derivation of the formulae for leptoproduction matrix elements is given in papers [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3], and we do not discuss it here. Let us just mention that such a representation of matrix elements becomes possible because the dipole size ρ is practically constant during the intermediate stage of scattering of the dipole on the nucleon as discussed above.

Since we are interested here just in the ratio R given by (1) and not in the absolute value of the leptoproduction cross section, we shall describe general dependences of the wave functions ψ and the scattering cross section σ on z and ρ leaving aside all constant factors cancelled out in the ratio R. Thus the wave function of the virtual (longitudinally polarized) photon is proportional to z(1 - z)K0(ερ), where K0 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind,

[formula]

m is the quark mass. The wave function of the vector meson has either similar dependence on z or acquires another factor (1 - 2z)2. The first case corresponds to the asymptotical form of the distribution while the second one to the form with suppressed contribution of the symmetrical shares of energy suggested for pions in the paper [\cite=6] when considering the QCD sum rules. The cross section of the interaction of the colour dipole with the nucleon is usually described either by an expression relating it to the gluon structure function so that [formula], where one uses any of the successful parametrizations of experimental data obtained at HERA for the structure function G(x,Q2), or by the semiphenomenological formula [\cite=1] [formula], where RN is the nucleon radius, which takes into account that the strong interaction cross section is bounded by the particle size.

The typical common feature of these formulae in both approaches is the smallness of the dipole cross section for small size dipoles due to the factor ρ2. It is called the colour transparency effect. Its physical origin is well known from its analogue in quantum electrodynamics which is called Chudakov effect and ascribed to the mutual screening of the opposite sign electric charges of the components of an electron-positron pair at a small space separation between them. It suppresses the role of small size dipoles and, therefore, increases the effective average size of dipoles conributing to the process.

The definite choice of various forms of the wave functions and the dipole cross section as well as their normalization are discussed at some length in the cited papers [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. That is why we shall not discuss them in more details here and turn now to the Sudakov form factors of the colour dipole. In the paper [\cite=5] all Sudakov effects were organized into the wave function itself and written down as functions of z and ρ suitable for our purposes according to (1). The asymptotical form of Sudakov suppression factors has been given in Ref. [\cite=5]. Let us consider the first term of it which provides the dominant contribution at high virtualities. It can be written as

[formula]

where the constant Λ defines the QCD scale in the running coupling constant, c = 32 / (33 - 2nf), nf denotes the number of active flavours. We consider the case nf = 3, and therefore c  ≈  1.2. Let us mention that the expression (3) reminds closely the earlier obtained formula (15) of the unpublished preprint [\cite=a].

In Eq. (1), small dipoles are damped by the Chudakov effect, i.e., by the factor ρ2 in σ, while large dipoles by the wave functions, i.e., by the factor K0(ερ). Let us note that Sudakov form factors suppress large dipoles as well. For wavelengths long compared to ρ, radiation is damped by destructive interference of the dipole components and 1 / ρ acts as an infrared cutoff. Therefore, radiation forces ρ to smaller sizes. However the cutoff provided by the Bessel function in the wave functions appears to be more effective.

Let us show that these statements follow from Eqs. (3) and (1). Sudakov suppression in (1) is given by the factor

[formula]

where

[formula]

(quark masses are neglected in ε). Large sizes of the dipole are damped exponentially by the wave function and get additional damping Sudakov factor (4) which imposes further requirement that they should not exceed the range of nuclear forces ρ  ≤  1 / Λ. Therefore to simplify our model for analytical estimates we can neglect the factors like log (1 + R2N  /  ρ2) in the dipole cross section and deal with its ρ2-increase only because dipoles of relatively small sizes are important. It is easily seen from Eq. (4) that the value of ε2  ≈  z(1 - z)Q2 which accounts for conservation laws in the colour dipole properly sets up the scale of corrections but not Q2 itself.

The effective value of the dipole size and its diminishing due to Sudakov suppression are estimated qualitatively if one inserts the simplest analytical expressions for wave functions and dipole cross section discussed above. The ρ-integral in the numerator of (1) can be approximated by

[formula]

where K0(ερ) is replaced by its asymptotics proportional to (ερ)- 1 / 2e-  ερ. Therefore the effective values of ρ at large virtuality Q2 are given by

[formula]

From Eq. (7) it follows that the asymptotical formula for K0 can be used at ρeff with the accuracy better than 10% that is enough for our purposes. Moreover, the asymptotical expression imitates in some way the neglected "logarithmic" term of σ. We would like to stress that the asymptotical value of ρeff does not depend on infrared sensitive value of Λ because the effective size of the dipoles is much less than the radius of nuclear forces. In the logarithms of the preasymptotical term in (7) we have replaced the β value by its asymptotics (2.5 - c) and inserted Q / 2 instead of ε that corresponds to symmetrical sharing of energy among components of the dipole. To demonstrate the validity of the latest statement, we turn again to the formulae (3) or (4) and evaluate Sudakov suppression of symmetrical and asymmetrical pairs substituting now the effective value of ρ given by Eq. (7).

For symmetrical pairs with z = 1 - z = 1 / 2 one gets

[formula]

i.e., for small dipole sizes (7), the suppression becomes a numerical one instead of parametrical. Therefore, it does not change Q2-dependence in this approximation.

Near its maximum at z = 1 / 2 the Sudakov factor varies quite slowly and is approximated by

[formula]

For extremely asymmetrical pairs with z = Λ / Q or 1 - z = Λ / Q the suppression becomes much stronger at large Q

[formula]

The physical origin of this result is quite clear because a symmetrical pair is less inclined to emission of gluons due to stronger colour screening compared to an asymmetrical pair with tendency to the space separation of its colour components. In other words it can be stated if one treats the exchanged gluons as probes of the internal structure of the colour dipole. The quark-antiquark pair of size ρ can be resolved by the gluons with energy exceeding 1 / ρ. Therefore, Sudakov suppression is the stronger the farther one from another are the components of the pair and, consequently, the points of interaction with the nucleon.

One can evaluate the upper bound of R replacing the integrand in Eq. (6) by the expansion near its maximum ρ  =  ρeff given by (7) and considering the corresponding Gaussian integral. At large Q2 we have

[formula]

where β0  =  β(c = 0) = 2.5. The factors in front of β- 2c account for the diminished size of the dipole due to Sudakov suppression. The Chudakov effect combined with phase space factors is in charge of the high power of β in (11). The second factor comes from Sudakov form factors and wave function increase at smaller distances. Therefore, in total it results in an asymptotically constant factor. Strong Q-dependence of Sudakov form factors at constant ρ becomes cancelled due to smallness of effective ρ-values. No dependence on the strong forces scale Λ appears in the asymptotical expressions again.

For asymptotical estimates one can insert

[formula]

Thus one gets at large Q2

[formula]

Therefore Sudakov form factors imposed on Chudakov effect suppress the cross section of leptoproduction of vector mesons by an order of magnitude, at least. This damping is much stronger than all the corrections previously considered. Let us stress again the new feature revealed by our analysis that, for dipole sizes as small as given by (7), strong cancellations appear in (3), form factors become constant and do not depend on Q2.

To get more definite conclusions (in particular about Q2 dependence of the correction terms) one needs accurate quantitative estimates according to Eq. (1) taking into account non-leading terms in S, different forms of the wave functions and the dipole cross section. We have treated the leading term of dipole form factors (3). However, the preasymptotical terms should be included as well for virtualities available in experiment. Besides, it becomes especially important in view of strong cancellations in Q2-dependence of form factors even for large virtualities due to small dipole sizes as demonstrated above. We intend to do it as soon as possible.

Still, one can get some qualitative conclusions right now. For example, it is clear that Sudakov damping is stronger for wave functions with suppressed equal sharing of energy like those ones given in Ref. [\cite=6].

Also, the relative role of Sudakov form factors and of the wave functions is essential in meson-meson, meson-baryon and baryon-baryon elastic scattering as considered in Ref. [\cite=5]. It can change somewhat the conclusions of Ref. [\cite=5] about the saddle point location and the relation between the Landshoff model and dimensional counting rules. The relative contributions of symmetrical and asymmetrical pairs in nuclear shadowing should be reconsidered as well. All these problems will be treated in a subsequent publication.

To conclude, we have shown that Sudakov suppression of the cross section of leptoproduction of vector mesons is quite strong if the term (3) is still prevailing for small size dipoles (7). The general effect of Sudakov form factors is further suppression of large size colour dipoles and of unequal sharing of energy among its components apart from effects due to the wave functions.
