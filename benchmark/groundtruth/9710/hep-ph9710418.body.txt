Introduction

The hierarchical patterns of quark-lepton masses and flavor mixings have been one of the outstanding problems in particle physics. From the viewpoint of quark-lepton unification it seems to be plausible that the hierarchical structure of Yukawa couplings for leptons is similar to that for quarks and that lepton flavor mixings are also parallel to quark flavor mixings. Experimentally, however, the large neutrino flavor mixing  sin θ23 has been suggested by the muon neutrino deficit in the atmospheric neutrino flux [\cite=Atmos]. This implies that lepton flavor mixings are remarkably different from quark flavor mixings in their hierarchical pattern. A natural question arises as to whether or not the distinct flavor mixings of quarks and leptons are in accord with the quark-lepton unification.

From the viewpoint of unification theory, it is reasonable that the hierarchical structure of Yukawa couplings is attributable to some kinds of the flavor symmetry at the unification scale MU. If there exists the flavor symmetry such as [formula] or U(1) in the theory, it is natural that Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism is at work for the interactions [\cite=Frog]. For instance, the effective Yukawa interactions for up-type quarks are of the form

[formula]

with

[formula]

where subscripts i and j stand for the generation indices and all of the constants cij are of order O(1) with rank cij = 3. The superfield X, which is singlet under the unification gauge group, is an appropriate composite superfield with the canonical normalization. The vaccum expectation value (VEV) of X is supposed to be slightly smaller than MU, where MU is nearly equal to the reduced Planck scale. For simplicity, we introduce global flavor U(1) symmetry and [formula]-symmetry (R-parity) at the unification scale. The charge of the superfield X is assumed to be ( - 1, + ) under [formula]. Instead of U(1) we may take the [formula]-symmetry. In that case the present analysis remains unchanged. Due to the U(1)-symmetry the exponents mij in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Mij]) are determined according as the U(1)-charges of Qi, Ucj and Hu. Here we denote the differences of U(1)-charges for Q2-Q1, Q3-Q2, Uc2-Uc1 and Uc3-Uc2 by α, γ, β and δ, respectively. We have

[formula]

provided that α, γ, β, δ and m33 are non-negative. The mass matrix of the up-type quarks is described by the matrix M multiplied by vu  =  〈Hu〉. By taking an ansatz that only top-quark has a trilinear coupling, i.e.

[formula]

we obtain mass eigenvalues

[formula]

which correspond to u-, c- and t-quarks, respectively. Thus, naively, the mass hierarchy of quarks and leptons, up to the renormalization effects, seems to be controlled only by U(1)-charges of the matter fields. However, in a wide class of unification models, the situation is not so simple. This is because the massless sector in the unification theory includes extra particles beyond the standard model and then there may occur extra-particle mixings such as between quarks(leptons) and colored Higgs fields(doublet Higgs fields). In order to study fermion masses and flavor mixings we have to take the effects of the extra-particle mixings into account. In addition, in the neutrino sector we should incorporate the extra-particle mixings with the see-saw mechanism [\cite=Seesaw]. In Ref.[\cite=QCKM] we explained the observed hierarchical structure of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) matrix for quarks in the string inspired SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R model.

In this paper we explore the CKM matrix for leptons. Several authors have pointed out that large neutrino flavor mixing can be obtained as a consequence of the cooperation between Dirac and Majorana mass matrices, provided that the Majorana mass matrix has a specific structure [\cite=Enhance]. In the quark-lepton unification, however, the Majorana mass matrix is closely linked to the other mass matrices and then it is difficult to expect such a cooperation between the Dirac and the Majorana mass matrices. In this paper, on the basis of E6-type unification models we show that neutrino flavor mixing sin θ23 is nearly equal to λ  =   sin θC as an initial condition around the unification scale. Due to large Yukawa couplings of neutrinos the renormalization effect increases sin θ23 naturally up to ~  1 at the electroweak scale [\cite=Babu][\cite=Tanimoto]. Although in the present study we take a specific string inspired model, our results are applicable to a wide class of the unification models.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we explain the interrelation between the hierarchical structure of mass matrices and the flavor symmetries based on the string inspired SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R model. Section 3 contains the mass spectra and the CKM matrix of quarks, which have been obtained in Ref. [\cite=QCKM]. After solving extra-particle mixings including the see-saw mechanism, we derive the CKM matrix of leptons in section 4. In section 5 we discuss the renormalization effect of the CKM matrices from the unification scale to the electroweak scale. Section 6 is devoted to summary.

The hierarchical structure of mass matrices

In this study we choose SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R as the gauge symmetry at the unification scale, which can be derived from the superstring theory via the flux breaking [\cite=Aligned]. Under SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R doublet Higgs and color triplet Higgs fields transform differently. This situation is favorable to solve the triplet-doublet splitting problem [\cite=Weak]. The chiral superfields, if we represent them in terms of E6, consist of

[formula]

except for E6-singlets, where Nf denotes the family number at low energies and δ is the set number of vector-like multiplets. Let us now consider the case Nf  =  3 and δ = 1. Under SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R chiral superfields in [formula] representation of E6 are decomposed into

[formula]

where g, gc and Hu, Hd represent colored Higgs and doublet Higgs fields, respectively. Nc stand for the right-handed neutrino superfield and S is an SO(10)-singlet. Although L and Hd (Dc and gc) have the same quantum numbers under the standard model gauge group GSM  =  SU(3)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y, they belong to different irreducible representations of SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R. Gauge invariant trilinear couplings are of the forms

[formula]

In the present model the massless matter fields are composed of chiral multiplets Φi, Ψi (i = 1,2,3) and one set of vector-like multiplets Φ0, Ψ0 and [formula], [formula]. Supposing that ordinary quarks and leptons are included in chiral multiplets Φi, Ψi (i = 1,2,3), R-parity of all Φi, Ψi (i = 1,2,3) are set to be odd. Since light Higgs scalars are even under R-parity, light Higgs doublets are bound to reside in Ψ0 and/or [formula]. For this reason we assign even R-parity to vector-like multiplets. It is expected that the R-parity remains unbroken down to the electroweak scale [\cite=QCKM]. Hereafter we use the notations α, β, γ and δ defined by

[formula]

where ai and bi (i = 1,2,3) represent the global U(1)-charges of matter fields Φi and Ψi, respectively. All of α, β, γ and δ are taken to be positive.

As shown in Ref.[\cite=QCKM], under an appropriate condition the gauge symmetry SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R is spontaneouly broken in two steps at the scales [formula] ([formula]) and [formula] ([formula]) as

[formula]

where SU(4)PS stands for the Pati-Salam SU(4) [\cite=Pati]. Further, when [formula] has the same U(1)-charge as [formula] for a positive integer k, we are led to the relation (〈S0〉 / MU)k≃〈Nc0〉 / MU [\cite=Majorana]. We will assume that Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism is at work and that the superfields X in Eq.([\ref=eqn:Mij]) is expressed in terms of Φ0, [formula] and/or moduli fields. In our scheme this assumption is natural. The SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R invariant and the global [formula] invariant interactions which contribute to the mass matrices of quarks and leptons are classified into six types of the superpotential term

[formula]

in MU units with i, j  =  1,2,3. The exponents are expressed as

[formula]

provided that z33, s33, t33, h33, n33  >  m33  =  0. At energies below the scale [formula] we have six types of bilinear terms

[formula]

with

[formula]

where the matrices Γ1 and Γ2 are defined by

[formula]

and all elements of the rank 3 matrices Z0, G0 and so on are of order O(1). We suppose that there is no fine-tuning among elements of each matrix Z0, etc. The normalization constants yZ, yH, yS, yT and yN are expressed in terms of VEVs of GSM-neutral fields divided by MU. We have the relation G  =  yM. In what follows we direct our attention to the case

[formula]

The CKM matrix of quarks

In this section we briefly review the results obtained in Ref.[\cite=QCKM]. The mass matrix M of the up-type quarks can be diagonalized by a bi-unitary transformation as

[formula]

Since we have the form

[formula]

Vu and Uu become

[formula]

The mass eigenvalues are given in Eq.([\ref=eqn:muct]).

For down-type quarks there appear the mixings between gc and Dc at energies below the scale MPS  =  〈Nc0〉. An early attempt of explaining the CKM matrix via Dc-gc mixings has been made in Ref.[\cite=SO10], in which a SUSY SO(10) model was considered. The mass matrix of down-type colored fields is written as

[formula]

in MU units, where we used the notation ρd  =  〈Hd0〉 / MU  =  vd / MU. Note that G  =  yM. Since ρd is a very small number(~  10- 16), the left-handed light quarks consist almost only of D-components of the quark doublet Q. On the other hand, the mixing between gc and Dc can be sizeable depending on the ratio yG / y. The mixing matrix Vd of the SU(2)L-doublet light quarks D is determined such that V- 1d(A- 1d  +  B- 1d)- 1Vd becomes diagonal, where Ad and Bd stand for ZZ†, GG†, respectively. From the expression

[formula]

we find that corresponding elements of the matrices Vd and Vu are of the same order of magnitude. Let us assume that the (1,1) elements of A- 1d and B- 1d are of the same order, i.e.

[formula]

In this case the coefficients of the leading term in off-diagonal elements of Vu and Vd become different because of large mixing between Dc and gc. Consequently, the CKM matrix for quarks is given by

[formula]

For the down-type light quarks their masses squared are described as the eigenvalues of the matrix

[formula]

with εd  =  ρd / y. Thus, we have the mass eigenvalues

[formula]

at the scale MPS, which correspond to d-, s- and b-quarks, respectively. In this model vu / vd  =   tan β  ~  1 is preferable. The masses of the down-type heavy quarks are O(MU  y).

The CKM matrix of leptons

We now proceed to study the flavor mixing of leptons. In the lepton sector large L -Hd mixing possibly occurs at energies below the scale MPS. It is worth emphasizing that both L and Hd are SU(2)L-doublets. This situation is in contrast to the Dc-gc mixing. For charged leptons we obtain a 6  ×  6 mass matrix

[formula]

in MU units. The matrix l can be diagonalized by a bi-unitary transformation as

[formula]

The unitary matrices l and l have the forms

[formula]

in the εd expansion, where Al  =  H†H and Bl  =  G†G. Wl and Vl are unitary matrices which diagonalize (Al  +  Bl) and (A- 1l  +  B- 1l)- 1 as

[formula]

where Λ(0)l and Λ(2)l are diagonal. Equation ([\ref=eqn:hatul]) implies that the light SU(2)L-singlet charged leptons are mainly Ec-components. From Eq.([\ref=eqn:hatvl]), the mass eigenstates of light SU(2)L-doublet charged leptons are given by

[formula]

Consequently, when the elements of H- 1 and G- 1 are comparable to each other, there occurs large mixing between H-d and L-. By inspecting the expression

[formula]

it is easy to see that Vl has the same hierarchical pattern as Uu. Let us take an additional ansatz

[formula]

with β  -  α  ≤  ξ  >  0. This implies that the large mixing occurs between H-d and L-. Thus we find that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Masses of light charged leptons turn out to be

[formula]

at the scale MPS, which correspond to e-, μ- and τ-leptons, respectively.

In the neutral lepton sector we have a 15  ×  15 mass matrix

[formula]

in MU units, where ρu  =  vu / MS. The 6  ×  6 submatrix

[formula]

represents the Majorana mass terms. In the study of lepton flavor mixing, instead of the matrix ([\ref=eqn:Mns]) we may consider the 12  ×  12 submatrix

[formula]

We will show shortly that the result remains unchanged. By recalling the above study in the charged lepton sector, it is easy to see that the unitary matrix N which diagonalizes N is of the form

[formula]

Note that l is a 6  ×  6 matrix Eq.([\ref=eqn:hatvl]) and that Wl is defined in Eq.([\ref=eqn:WlVl]). The unitary matrix UN diagonalizes the Majorana mass matrix N as

[formula]

This means that the Majorana masses have also hierarchical structure. By examining the unitary matrix N, it turns out that the light neutrino mass eigenstates are

[formula]

Comparing these eigenstates 0 with those of the light charged leptons - given by Eq.([\ref=eqn:l-]), we find that V is the CKM matrix for leptons. V is determined such that

[formula]

becomes diagonal. Using Eq.([\ref=eqn:Ll2]), we obtain

[formula]

Consequently, the lepton flavor mixing matrix is of the form

[formula]

at the scale MPS. It should be emphasized that we obtain an interesting relation between the lepton mixing angle and the quark mixing angle

[formula]

at the scale MPS. The light neutrino masses are given by the eigenvalues of the matrix Eq.([\ref=eqn:alxi]) multiplied by (ρu / y)2. Thus we have

[formula]

In the case of the matrix Eq.([\ref=eqn:Mns]), N- 1 in Eq.([\ref=eqn:VLVN]) should be replaced by

[formula]

Since this quantity has essentially the same form as [formula], we obtain the same mixing matrix Eq.([\ref=eqn:LCKM]).

The CKM matrices at the electroweak scale

In the above study we obtain the CKM matrices for quarks and leptons at the scale MPS. Although we derive a remarkable relation, i.e. Eq.([\ref=eqn:theta23]) at the scale MPS, we should correctly relate them to the values at low energies where they are measured. Since matter fields of the third generation have large Yukawa couplings, it is important to investigate the renormalization effects of the flavor mixings sin θQ23 and sin θL23 from the scale MPS to the electroweak scale. Here MPS is supposed to be 1016  ~  1017GeV [\cite=QCKM]. In Refs.[\cite=Babu][\cite=Tanimoto], it has been shown in the minimal supersymmetric standard model that the neutrino flavor mixing sin θL23 increases significantly with running down to the electroweak scale by the renormalization group equation (RGE). From the scale MPS to the Majorana mass scale MU  yN we manipulate the RGE for Yukawa couplings. Below the scale MU  yN we study the RGE of the neutrino mass operator κ [\cite=Babu], which is given by

[formula]

Since effective Yukawa couplings of the first and the second generations are very small, the renormalization effect of sin θ12 is also rather small compared with that of sin θ23. In the lepton sector the SU(3)c gauge interaction does not contribute to the one-loop RGE of Yukawa couplings. Therefore, the renormalization effect of sin θL23 becomes more significant compared with that of sin θQ23. From rough estimations, we can expect that sin θ23 is enhanced by a factor 2 in running down to the electroweak scale from the scale MPS. In this case we have

[formula]

with λ  =   sin θC≃0.22. This means that sin 2θL23(MZ)  =  0.8  ~  0.9. This is consistent with the atmospheric neutrino data [\cite=Atmos]. The detailed study of the renormalization effect of sin θ23 will be presented elsewhere.

Confronting the CKM matrix for quarks obtained here with the observed one, it is feasible for us to take a simple parametrization

[formula]

Under this parametrization the hierarchical fermion masses at the scale MPS become

[formula]

for up-type quarks,

[formula]

for down-type quarks,

[formula]

for charged leptons. These results are consistent with the observed mass spectra of quarks and leptons. Further, the neutrino masses are

[formula]

at the scale MPS. Taking MU  yN  =  1011.5  GeV as a typical Majorana mass scale, apart from the renormalization effect, we obtain

[formula]

Provided that the renormalization effects of sin θQ23 and sin θL23 are roughly about a factor 2  ~  λ- 0.5, the CKM matrices at the electroweak scale are expressed as

[formula]

for quarks and

[formula]

for leptons. The hierarchical structure of VQCKM is also consistent with the experimental data. Furthermore, it is worthy of note that neutrino masses and mixings obtained in this paper roughtly accommodate both the small angle MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem [\cite=MSW][\cite=SAsol] as well as the νμ-ντ oscillation solution to the muon neutrino deficit in the atmospheric neutrino flux. However, the present model cannot explain the LSND results which, if confirmed, indicate Δm2LSND  ~  1eV2 and sin 22θ  ~  10- 3 [\cite=LSND].

Summary

Large neutrino flavor mixing sin θL23 has been suggested by the muon neutrino deficit in the atmospheric neutrino flux. This means that lepton flavor mixings are remarkably different from quark flavor mixings in their hierarchical pattern. The difference of the structure of the CKM matrix between quarks and leptons is explanable in the SU(6)  ×  SU(2)R model and in the E6-type unification models. In the models the massless sector includes extra particles beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Concretely, we have triplet Higgs and doublet Higgs fields in each generation. As a consequence of such matter contents, there appear the mixings between the down-type quarks Dc and triplet Higgses gc and between doublet leptons L and doublet Higgses Hd. These mixings, if large, turn the mass pattern of down-type quarks and leptons out of that of up-type quarks. Further, it is expected that the hierarchical structure of Yukawa couplings comes from Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism under some kind of the flavor symmetry. Combining the unification models with this mechanism, we obtained the CKM matrices VQCKM and VLCKM which are remarkably different from each other in the hierarchical pattern. In particular, the relation

[formula]

holds at the scale MPS. Due to large Yukawa couplings of the third generation the renormalization effect of flavor mixing sin θ23 is sizeable. It can be expected that neutrino flavor mixing sin θL23 increases by a factor about 2 with running down to the electroweak scale by the RGE. Thus we obtain

[formula]

which is consistent with the data. Fermion mass spectra and the CKM matrix of quarks obtained here are also phenomenologically viable. The hierarchical structure of fermion masses and the CKM matrices of quarks and leptons provides an important clue to the matter contents and the flavor symmetries at the unification scale.
