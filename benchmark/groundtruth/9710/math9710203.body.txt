Introduction

For a Banach space X let [formula] denote its complex conjugate, i.e. the Banach space X equipped with the scalar multiplication [formula].

For an operator T:X  →  Y let [formula] denote its complex conjugate, i.e. the operator T acting between [formula] and [formula]. This is again a linear operator.

For a complex operator ideal [formula] the complex conjugate ideal [formula] is defined as the ideal consisting of all T such that [formula].

The ideal [formula] is called self conjugate if [formula].

The problem of the existence of operator ideals that are not self conjugate was left open in [\cite=wen95]. However, it was reduced there to the problem of finding a complex Banach space that is not isomorphic to its complex conjugate, but that is isomorphic to its square.

In [\cite=kal95], Kalton gives examples of Banach spaces Zα which are not isomorphic to their complex conjugates. On the other hand, the elementary nature of these spaces makes it possible to easily verify that they are isomorphic to their squares, thus yielding the required Banach spaces.

The spaces Zα

In [\cite=kal95] Kalton constructed elementary examples of Banach spaces Zα, not isomorphic to their complex conjugates. We need only one additional property of these spaces which is not explicitly mentioned in [\cite=kal95], namely that Zα is Cartesian. This is however easy, as is shown below.

For the convenience of the reader, let us repeat here the definition of Zα.

Let fα(t): = t1 + iα for -    ∞    <  α  <    ∞   and 0  ≤  t <   ∞  . Given a sequence x = (ξk)∈l2 define the sequence Ωα(x) by

[formula]

Let Zα be the space of all pairs of complex-valued sequences (x,y) such that

[formula]

It turns out that Zα is a Banach space under a norm equivalent to the quasi norm [formula].

Moreover [formula] and Zα is isomorphic to Zβ if and only if α  =  β.

A Banach space X is called Cartesian if it is isomorphic to its Cartesian square [formula].

The spaces Zα are Cartesian.

Proof:  For a complex-valued sequence x = (ξk) define

[formula]

Then the map [formula] defined by

[formula]

defines an isomorphism.

The bijectivity of U is trivial, so we only show its continuity.

It is mentioned in [\cite=kal95] that there is a constant C, such that for s∈l∞ we have the estimate

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

This proves the assertion. [formula]

Main theorem

For [formula] the operator ideal

[formula]

is not self conjugate.

Proof:  Since Zα is Cartesian, [formula] is indeed an operator ideal. Now [formula]. Assume that [formula]. This implies that Zα and [formula] are complemented in each other. Since Zα and [formula] are Cartesian, we can apply Pełczyski's decomposition method to obtain that Zα and [formula] are actually isomorphic which contradicts the properties of these spaces. See [\cite=wen95] for details. [formula]
