R-Invariant Unification with Dynamical Higgs Multiplets

Introduction

Fine tuning of coupling constants is required when some terms in the Lagrangian are unnaturally small without the possibility of a symmetry-based explanation. In other words, the symmetries that could forbid such small terms would inevitably also forbid some necessary terms.

There may be various ways to avoid this unnatural fine tuning. One possible way is to utilize anomalous symmetries which forbid small terms to be fine tuned and whose quantum breaking may generate necessary terms.

The doublet-triplet splitting in the supersymmetric grand unified theory (SUSY GUT) [\cite=Dim] poses one of the most serious fine-tuning problems in particle physics. In this paper, we construct R-invariant unification models with composite Higgs multiplets. Higgs doublets are massless due to the R symmetry, which is not spontaneously broken at the GUT scale [\cite=Iza], while Higgs triplets attain large masses from a dynamically generated superpotential, which is allowed by an R anomaly.

The Model

We extend the minimal SU(5)GUT GUT to a semisimple gauge theory in order to incorporate a strong interaction which produces composite Higgs multiplets.

We consider an SU(5)GUT  ×  SU(5)H model. The quarks and leptons obey the usual transformation law under the GUT group SU(5)GUT, while they are all singlets of the hypercolor gauge group SU(5)H. This hypercolor interaction plays the role of making composite Higgs doublets in the SUSY standard model.

We introduce six pairs of hyperquarks [formula] and [formula] ([formula]) which transform as [formula] and [formula] under the hypercolor group SU(5)H. The first five pairs [formula] and [formula] ([formula]) belong to [formula] and [formula] of SU(5)GUT, respectively, and the last pair [formula] and [formula] are singlets of SU(5)GUT.

We also introduce an adjoint representation Σji of SU(5)GUT and two singlets X̄ and X whose R charges are two [\cite=Iza]. The superpotential for [formula], [formula], Σji, X̄ and X is given by

[formula]

where we have assumed the vanishing R charges of [formula] and [formula] and have omitted higher-order terms which are not important for our purposes. We have also imposed a U(1)X symmetry with the charges of [formula], [formula], X̄ and X as 1, - 1, - 5 and 5, respectively. Here we suppose that the higher-order terms are suppressed by a cutoff (say the Planck) scale in the present effective theory below the cutoff scale, which we set to unity.

The Dynamics

In the following sections, we investigate the model by means of effective field theory analysis.

The effective superpotential of the model may be written as

[formula]

in terms of the chiral superfields

[formula]

where Λ denotes a dynamical scale of the SU(5)H interaction [\cite=Kap].

The F-flatness condition yields vacuum expectation values satisfying

[formula]

where the last equation is a part of the condition ∂Weff  /  ∂MIJ  =  0. Together with the D-flatness condition of the SU(5)GUT interaction [\cite=Dra], we obtain the desired form [\cite=Wil] of the vacuum expectation value of Mij with Σji  =  0, X̄  =  0, X  =  0, Bi  =  0, [formula], M6i  =  0 and Mi6  =  0:

[formula]

where the vanishing eigenvalues are enforced by the condition det Mij  =  0 in Eq.({[\ref=FFL]). The GUT scale is expected to be of order λ  /  (λ'Λ). We note that the R symmetry is unbroken in this vacuum [\cite=Iza].

Low-Energy Spectrum

Let us consider the low-energy mass spectrum of the model in the vacuum Eq.([\ref=VEV]).

The color triplets in the composites Bi and [formula] acquire large masses due to the form Eq.([\ref=VEV]) of the vacuum expectation value of Mij from the interaction term [formula] in the effective superpotential Eq.({[\ref=ESP]).

On the other hand, the weak doublets Bi and [formula] (i  =  4,5) remain massless due to the vanishing of the eigenvalues of Mij in Eq.([\ref=VEV]). We may regard these doublets as those in the SUSY standard model and introduce their Yukawa interactions with quarks and leptons. We are led to consider the case that the dynamical scale Λ is of order 1, so as to have the heavy top quark with a large Yukawa coupling.

In addition, M6i and Mi6 yield massless complete multiplets of SU(5)GUT, and M66 gives a massless singlet. They are protected from having masses by the R symmetry, as is the case for the composite Higgs doublets Bi and [formula] (i  =  4,5). The R (and SUSY) breaking may allow these multiplets to have masses on the order of the weak scale. This may stabilize our vacuum M6i  =  Mi6  =  0.

Conclusion

We have constructed an R-invariant SU(5)GUT  ×  SU(5)H unification model which, in particular, naturally yields the SUSY standard model with the weak doublets. The SU(5)H hypercolor gauge interaction provides the weak doublets as composites of the hyperquarks without its color triplet partners at low energy. The triplets attain large masses from the dynamically generated superpotential of the SU(5)H interaction, which is allowed by an R anomaly, while the R symmetry preserves the masslessness of the doublets as long as it is unbroken together with the SUSY. This model predicts, in addition to the contents of the minimal SUSY standard model, a pair of [formula] and [formula] of SU(5)GUT and a singlet at the weak scale. These predictions may be tested in future collider experiments.

Along similar lines of construction, we may consider unification models with dynamical Higgs multiplets by means of other semisimple gauge groups. For example, the composite Higgs multiplets in the SU(5)GUT GUT may be predicted by an SU(4)H hypercolor gauge theory with five flavors of hyperquarks instead of the SU(5)H theory. Namely, we may consider an SU(5)GUT  ×  SU(4)H model. An extension to the SO(10)GUT GUT is also possible. We may construct an SO(10)GUT  ×  SU(10)H model with eleven flavors of hyperquarks in a similar fashion to the SU(5)GUT  ×  SU(5)H model.
