Abstract

The generalization of Kasteleyn and Fortuin clusters formalism is introduced in XY (or more generally O(n)) models. Clusters geometrical structure may be linked to spin physical properties as correlation functions. To investigate percolative characteristics, the new cluster definition is analytically explored in one dimension and with Monte Carlo simulations in 2D and 3D frustrated and unfrustrated n-clock models.

Introduction

The idea to describe long range correlations and coherency in spin systems from a geometrical point of view dates thirty years back. In the late sixties this project was accomplished for Ising models by Kasteleyn and Fortuin (KF), who developed a method to give intrinsic definitions of clusters of spins which might describe with their percolation characteristics the structure of correlations patterns. Cluster formalism and percolation tools [\cite=KF] [\cite=CK], have proven extremely useful in the understanding of critical phenomena of Ising models [\cite=droplets] [\cite=Wu]. Among the many results, very interesting is the discovery of the possibility to describe spin correlations trough percolative connectivity functions and the consequent link between thermodynamic critical behaviors and cluster fractal structures (see [\cite=89Co]). The individuation of "physical" clusters of spin introduced within this approach, has been also successfully exploited by Swendsen and Wang (SW) [\cite=SW] [\cite=Wolff] to develop fast Monte Carlo (MC) dynamics, for unfrustrated Ising models, based on cluster update and later on to drastically improve simulations in frustrated systems too [\cite=BADK] [\cite=noistessi].

Nevertheless, the discussions about the extension of cluster formalism and percolation concepts to continuous spin systems as XY or O(n) models is still open, and the equivalent of KF cluster in such systems is not known. Wolff [\cite=Wolff] has proposed a cluster definition in XY models based on a smart application of KF rule to spin projections along random directions. The clusters so introduced have proven to have a percolative critical temperature exactly equal to the thermodynamic one in unfrustrated XY models, also if their ultimately connections with spin properties is not understood [\cite=Henley]. One of the successes of KF approach consists in the clarification of the links between the clusters and the physics of the spins.

In this paper we try to address a possible generalization to XY and O(n) models of KF approach to Ising like systems. This extension leads to new cluster definitions. In the spirit of Kasteleyn-Fortuin and Coniglio-Klein (CK) works, we try to focus the relations between clusters and spins, disregarding, at the moment, applications to efficient MC algorithms. Specifically we try to introduce concepts and tools to manipulate the the structure of such clusters in this larger context, as done by KF and CK in Ising like systems. In ferromagnetic models, the new clusters generally individuate regions of statistically coherent spins, i.e. almost parallel spins, and describe the physics of such aggregates. For sake of clarity, before passing to such a generalization (presented in section 3 and 4), in section 2 a fast outlook to KF original approach to Ising systems is given, to define notations and concepts used in what follows. Later, the properties of these new clusters are analytically studied in one dimension and via MC simulations in n-clock models in 2D and 3D, where the thermodynamic transitions have different properties.

Cluster formalism for Ising spin Hamiltonians

Let us consider an Ising system of spins Si  =    ±  1 with Hamiltonian:

[formula]

where {Si} is the spin configuration, the sum is over all interacting spin pairs and, as usually, β = 1 / kBT. The constants in the Hamiltonian have been chosen for future convenience and for simplicity we can consider Jij = J > 0 [formula],j, i.e. we take an Ising isotropic ferromagnet.

The cluster formalism to describe "droplets" of Ising spin [\cite=droplets] was originally developed by Kasteleyn and Fortuin [\cite=KF], and later on in a different approach by Coniglio and Klein [\cite=CK]. It is based on the mapping of the original model described by Hamiltonian ([\ref=Ham]) into a new model in which spin couplings have infinite or zero strength. The mapping consists in stochastically changing the interactions Jij between spin pairs to new values J'ij (to define clusters we are interested in the limit |J'ij|  →    ∞   or J'ij  →  0), in such a way that the two models, with new and old interactions, are statistically equivalent.

To this aim, following KF, let's consider then each single couple of interacting spin Si and Sj, and suppose J'ij∈{0,J', - J'} with J' > 0. If the change of Jij to a new interaction J'ij = J' occurs with a weight p0, to a J'ij =  - J' with pπ and to J'ij = 0 with q, then the sum of statistical weights of a spin configuration {Si,Sj} in the new possible models is [\cite=KF] [\cite=CK]:

[formula]

It is to be noticed that we are slightly modifying KF-CK original approach in which pπ was a priori set to zero. To impose the statistical equivalence of the original and mapping models we must then require that a given spin configuration has the same weight:

[formula]

So for each pair of interacting spins we must require:

[formula]

where the p0, pπ and q are unknown temperature functions.

To introduce the definition of clusters of spins we must consider the limit J'  →    ∞  . Two spins Si and Sj connected in the new model by an infinite interaction must have then a definite reciprocal direction (i.e. parallel if J'ij =  + J' and antiparallel if J'ij =  - J') to have a non zero weight, otherwise, if disconnected, they are completely independent. Thus in the new model the clusters are naturally defined as the maximal sets of spins connected by ∞   interactions (called bonds). The deletion (J'ij = 0) or the freezing (|J'ij| =   ∞  ) of the original interactions leads to the contraction of the spin lattice in independent fundamental units: the clusters. In the limit J'  →    ∞  , eq.([\ref=KFeq]) becomes:

[formula]

This is a linear system of two equations with three unknowns q, p0 and pπ, and so it is possible to introduce physical constraints to select some definite solution [\cite=noistessi]. To this aim let's introduce the connectivity function γij , which is one if spin Si and Sj belong to the same cluster and zero otherwise. It is possible to show that connectivity is always greater or equal to spin correlation [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=CLMP]:

[formula]

where [formula] ([formula]) is one if Si and Sj belong to the same cluster and are parallel (antiparallel). A criterion which proved to be extremely important to select the definitions of interesting clusters (i.e. the relative value of q, p0 and pπ) is to make connectivity as close as possible to correlation, i.e. to minimize connectivity as a function of q, p0 and pπ [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1]:

[formula]

This natural condition, which essentially corresponds to select clusters whose structure resembles the correlation patterns in the system, has given excellent results in frustrated and unfrustrated Ising spin systems [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1]. In the case of the simplest approximation in which we consider just a single couple of interacting spin Si and Sj, the mean connectivity is 〈γij〉 = (p0 + pπ) / (1 + e- 2J), and to impose condition ([\ref=conminisi]), with constraints 0  ≤  q,p0,pπ, naturally leads to pπ = 0 (or analogously p0 = 0 if J < 0). In the present case, this results may be also simply obtained by directly imposing 〈SiSj〉  =  〈γij〉. The solution:

[formula]

is the well known result by Kasteleyn-Fortuin [\cite=KF] and by Coniglio-Klein [\cite=CK]. Within this context it is possible to show that the partition function of a Q-Potts model [\cite=Wu] may be written as (Q = 2 corresponds to Ising model) [\cite=KF] [\cite=CK]:

[formula]

where p0 = 1 - e- QJ = 1 - q, N(C) is the number of clusters in the bonds configuration C (i.e. the set of ∞   interactions), |C| (resp. |A|) is the total number of bonds in C (resp. of absent bonds or zero interactions), and [formula] is the sum over all bonds configurations. Eq.([\ref=Z]) gives the Ising partition function in terms of the partition function of a correlated-percolation model [\cite=staufferbook]. Moreover, with KF solution, for an Ising ferromagnet, eq.([\ref=corconisi]) becomes:

[formula]

Cluster formalism for XY spin Hamiltonians

Let's examine now the problem of cluster definitions in continuous spin systems. We consider an XY model, but the same arguments may be extended to O(n) models. Specifically, we consider a system of planar spins, Si, with pair Hamiltonian:

[formula]

where θi is the phase of spin Si, as above we suppose β = 1 / kBT and for clarity Jij = J > 0. The constant in the Hamiltonian has been chosen for convenience so that two ferromagnetically interacting spin have zero energy when they are parallel.

Following the idea proposed by KF, we map the original model described by Hamiltonian ([\ref=Hamxy]) into a new model in which the pair Hamiltonian between interacting spins is stochastically changed to new functional values H'ij, in such a way that the two models are statistically equivalent. As above, to individuate clusters we are interested in the limit H'ij  →    ∞   or H'ij  →  0. The main difference with the previous section will consists in the fact that many choices for H' are necessary, but the arguments will be the same. Let's so define new pair Hamiltonians characterized by a new variable φ'ij:

[formula]

where the parameter is φ'ij∈[0,2π], J'ij = J' > 0 and C(J') is an adjustable regularization function for the limit J'  →    ∞  .

To impose the statistical equivalence of the original and the mapping models, we then require that spin configurations have the same weight in both of them, so if we define p(φ') as the statistical weight to map the pair Hamiltonian ([\ref=Hamxy]) into H(Si,Sj;φ'), and q the weight to map it into a zero energy interaction, the equation corresponding to the ([\ref=KFeq]) becomes:

[formula]

As above, to define clusters we consider the limit J'  →    ∞  . Two spins Si and Sj connected in the new model H(Si,Sj;φ'ij) by an infinite interaction, must have a definite reciprocal direction (i.e. θi  -  θj  =  φ'ij) to have a non zero weight, otherwise, if not connected, they are completely independent. Thus in the new model the clusters are naturally defined as the maximal sets of spins connected by ∞   interactions ( bonds). In contrast to the Ising case we now have much more than just two kind of bonds (between parallel, p0, or antiparallel spins, pπ). Following this method it is then possible to generalize the procedure of deletion (J'ij = 0) and freezing (J'ij  =    ∞  ) of the original interactions. Also in this case different clusters are independent (if q is a function of θi  -  θj or if the infinite limit is not systematically taken, then one has interacting clusters). In the infinite limit J'  →    ∞  , eq.([\ref=KFeqxy]) becomes:

[formula]

where the function C(J') has been absorbed to regularize the definition of the δ-function in the interval

[formula]

Relations between thermodynamics and percolation

The previous section was devoted to introduce a simple generalization of Kasteleyn-Fortuin and Coniglio-Klein clusters in XY models. Now we face the problem to work out some main relations between percolative and thermodynamic quantities. Easy extensions may be given for general O(n) models.

The partition function of the XY model, from eq.([\ref=KFeqxyi]), may be written as:

[formula]

where |A| is the number of absent bonds on the lattice fixed the bonds configuration [formula], N() is the total number of clusters in [formula], and by definition [formula]. The sum, [formula], is intended over all possible bonds configurations, [formula], (note that two bonds configurations are distinguished by their geometry and by the kind of bonds {φ'ij} they have), and specifically:

[formula]

with [formula] the product over all bonds present in the configuration [formula], {φ'ij} the set of indexes of such present bonds and δ(,{φ'ij}) a function nonzero only if the configuration [formula] and the set {φ'ij} are compatible (i.e. if the sum of φ'ij between whatever fixed extrema h and k along a chain of present bonds, is independent of the path, i.e. clusters are well defined because such quantity is exactly the phase difference between Sh and Sk).

The percolative quantity to be compared to the thermodynamic two point correlation function is the pair connectivity c(i,j), defined as:

[formula]

where c(i,j,φ) = 〈γij(φ)〉 and γij(φ) = γij  ·  δ(θi  -  θj  -  φ) which is zero if spin Si and Sj do not belong to the same cluster or have a phase difference θi  -  θj  ≠  φ. c(i,j,φ) is so the probability of spin i and j to belong to the same cluster with a phase difference φ.

It is possible to show that the pair correlation function g(i,j) = 〈Si  ·  Sj〉 is given by:

[formula]

Eqs.([\ref=connxy]) and ([\ref=corrxy]) imply g(i,j)  ≤  c(i,j), analogously to Ising systems where eq. ([\ref=corconisi]) holds. A consequence of this proven inequality is that Tc  ≤  Tp, where Tc and Tp are defined as the temperatures where respectively the magnetic susceptivity χ and the mean cluster size [formula] [\cite=staufferbook] (ns is the number of clusters of size s and [formula] is the sum over just finite clusters) become singular. These relations naturally suggest, in analogy with the Ising spin case, the criterion of minimal connectivity to select clusters definitions, i.e. to impose the condition:

[formula]

where c(i,j) has to be minimized respect to p(φ). As anticipated above, imposing eq.([\ref=connminxy]) just for each single couple of interacting spin Si and Sj, directly leads to select the solution given in eq.([\ref=solxy]) for eq.([\ref=KFeqxyi]). It is to be noticed that this solution is however just the simplest extensions of KF result. In facts more general solutions must be found as showed below, but the general tools introduced to link percolative and spin properties, allows to exploit, for XY models, the many techniques to individuate and manipulate clusters known in the literature for Ising systems (see [\cite=KF] [\cite=CK] [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1]). In what follows we will restrict however to consider the simple solution given in eq.([\ref=solxy]).

The relations above reported indicate that thermodynamic spin quantities may be generally expressed in terms of cluster properties. For example it is possible to link the mean energy E with geometrical quantities. In the case of an isotropic ferromagnetic XY model it results:

[formula]

where 0 and 1 are two of the N interacting pairs of spin in the system. As eq.([\ref=Zxy]) is the natural generalization of eq.([\ref=Z]), so eq.([\ref=Exy]) is the extension of the corresponding energy-bond relation in Ising systems [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=Hu].

Clusters in one dimensional XY model

To understand the properties of the above defined clusters it may be interesting to analyze the question in some details. In a one dimensional XY model of nearest neighbor interacting spin [\cite=Stanleybook], the geometry of the above defined clusters corresponds to chains of bonds, and the problem is extremely simplified. So it is possible to prove that, adopting solution ([\ref=solxy]), the partition function, eq.([\ref=Zxy]), in the case of an isotropic XY ferromagnetic chain, is:

[formula]

where [formula] is just the sum over all graphs of bonds on the chain, P = 2πe- J(I0(J) - e- J) (In(x) is the imaginary argument Bessel function of order n). From eq.([\ref=Zxy1D]) it is possible to see that the partition function of an XY chain may be written as that of a Q-Potts linear model, ZQ (see eq.([\ref=Z])), times a simple factor. Specifically:

[formula]

where N is the total number of interactions, Q = 2π, Q  ·  JQ(J) =  ln (1 + P / q) (JQ  ~  J if J  →    ∞   or J  →  0), and K(N,J) = e- N(2J - QJQ).

We are concerned with clusters and spin properties, and in the context of the linear model it is possible to prove a definite relation between correlation g and connectivity c:

[formula]

where r = |i - j| is the number of spin between Si and Sj plus one, and

[formula]

Moreover the connectivity c(i,j) at temperature T = 1 / J for the XY model, is equal to the connectivity cQ(i,j) of the KF (or CK) clusters introduced above in the Q-Potts model with T = 1 / JQ(J) and Q = 2π:

[formula]

These results should shed some light on the connections between cluster connectivity and spin correlation in one dimensional XY models. A trivial consequence of all these relations in 1D is that Tp = Tc = 0 (it would be hard to find clusters with a bit of randomness with Tp > 0 in one dimension), but this coincidence does not hold for the critical behavior. Defining ξXY as the correlation length in the XY model and ξQ - Potts as the mean cluster radius in its Q-Potts equivalent, eq.([\ref=conncorr1D]) imposes ξ- 1XY  =  ξ- 1Q - Potts  +  ξ- 1, but, in 1D, at low temperature ξXY  ~  T- 1 while ξQ - Potts  ~  eA(Q) / T [\cite=staufferbook] [\cite=Stanleybook], and so clusters quite loosely express spin-spin correlations.

MC results for XY model in higher dimensions

The analytical problem concerning the structure of clusters in XY models in higher dimensions, is, worthless to say, much more difficult. We present then some Monte Carlo results about clusters properties (defined from solution ([\ref=solxy])), in two and three dimensions.

MC simulations were done using a standard Metropolis spin flip algorithm [\cite=Binder] on n-clock models on a square or cubic lattice described by Hamiltonian ([\ref=Hamxy]) (in the following if not specified we will consider the isotropic case Jij = J  ≥  0), whose spin Si have a phase θi = 2πm / n with m∈{0,...,n - 1}.

Let's briefly examine our MC results in two dimension. In the case n = 2 we exactly recover the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model. Our MC simulation indicate the well known result of equal critical temperatures Tc = Tp = 2.269 (all temperature are measured in unit of J) and a percolative critical phenomena characterized by Ising exponents. Moreover, the MC dynamic based on the above defined clusters is just the Swendsen-Wang dynamic and the phenomena of critical slowing down drastically reduced [\cite=SW] [\cite=Wolff].

For n  >  4 such correspondence is no longer verified. Such a result may be expected because in these cases connectivity and correlation are not coinciding as shown by the simple example of just two interacting spin with n = 5 (the cases n = 3,4 may be successfully faced with some tricks, in resemblance of the possibility to map n = 3,4 clock-models in an equivalent Q-Potts [\cite=Wu]).

The percolation critical temperature decreases for increasing n, and approaches a plateau in the large n limit. In actual facts, via MC simulations, for n = 36, we find that the percolation point is at

Tp = 1.69  ±  0.03

to be compared with the 2D XY critical temperature at Tc  ~  0.89 [\cite=Wolff] [\cite=Henley]. We find that the percolation critical exponents are in the universality class of random percolation as expected because there is no thermodynamic transition underlying the percolative one: the critical exponents, measured via a finite size scaling analysis [\cite=Binder] (reported in Fig. 1), are [formula] and [formula] in perfect agreement with 2D random percolation exact values ν = 4 / 3 and γ  /  ν = 43 / 24. These exponents, in percolation, characterize respectively the divergence of mean cluster radius ξ and mean cluster size S: ξ  ~  |T - Tp|-  ν and S  ~  |T - Tp|-  γ [\cite=staufferbook].

This behavior is observed, as may be easily suspected, in frustrated or disordered systems too. We tested, via MC, the Fully Frustrated XY model (FF) and the ±  J XY Spin Glass (SG) (see references in [\cite=Jose-Ramirez]), where we found the same percolative critical exponents and (see the scaling analysis in Fig. 2 and 3):

TFFp = 1.61  ±  0.03 and TSGp = 1.64  ±  0.03

This value for the percolation transition in the FF model is above the critical region located around T  ~  0.4  ÷  0.5 (see [\cite=Jose-Ramirez]). Also Wolff's clusters show a percolation point well above the critical region [\cite=Henley], but it is possible to introduce their direct generalizations whose Tp may be pushed closer and closer to it [\cite=Cataudellaxy].

The same kind of results are found in three dimension. For n = 2 we recover the well known properties of KF or SW clusters in the 3D Ising model Tp = Tc  ~  4.5 and ν  ~  0.62, γ  /  ν  ~  1.97 (see [\cite=FerrenbergLandau]). Our MC runs show, for n = 36, Tp = 3.75  ±  0.05 and 3D random percolation critical behavior with ν = 0.87  ±  .05 and γ  /  ν = 2.00  ±  .05 (see Fig.4). These values are to be compared to the results of 3D XY Tc  ~  2.2 and ν  ~  0.66, γ  /  ν  ~  1.98 (see [\cite=Gottlob]). Essentially the same values are found for the 3D ±  J XY Spin Glass.

It is interesting to note that, as expected and discussed above (see also [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1]), whenever the gap between Tp and Tc becomes finite, SW like cluster algorithms for MC simulations become unable to reduce critical slowing down.

After these MC results, the panorama we get illustrates that the straight generalization to XY models of KF clusters, given in eq.([\ref=solxy]), has not the peculiar properties of KF clusters in Ising like systems: the thermodynamic and percolative transition are no longer coincident. In Ising models more complex procedures have been introduced to individuate physical clusters, as those proposed in [\cite=BADK] [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1]. It would be interesting to verify if the extensions to XY of such procedures according the lines proposed above, have the same percolation properties here found or new interesting results can be obtained.

Summary and conclusions

In analogy to Kasteleyn and Fortuin and Coniglio and Klein works, cluster of nearest neighbor spin in XY models may be defined as the sets of spin connected by bonds according definite rules. The clusters divide the original lattice into independent regions of statistically coherent spins. Kasteleyn and Fortuin percolative concepts and tools to link clusters and spin properties, which proved to be so useful in Ising systems, can be so extended to XY models. In these models, at a first simple level, KF clusters may be defined by separately looking at just each single couple of interacting spins. Consequently, bonds are introduced between them according the definite probability distribution given in equation ([\ref=solxy]) (as a matter of fact, this is for XY models, but the analog for general O(n) is absolutely similar).

Nevertheless, at the simple level here explored, many differences appear with Ising systems. It is known that in the Ising model these clusters have a percolation point which, imposing condition ([\ref=connminxy]), may be pushed to coincide with the critical one Tc, and has percolative exponents in the Ising universality class [\cite=KF] [\cite=CK]. The properties of the new clusters may be studied analytically for continuous spin systems in one dimension. Here eq.([\ref=conncorr1D]) implies that clusters mean square radius, differently from Ising KF case, is no longer coincident with the correlation length in the system. Numerical results show the same behavior in higher dimensionality, where moreover cluster percolation point Tp is different from Tc. Phenomenologically, the temperature Tp is the point where regions of almost parallel spin (in ferromagnetic models), i.e. regions of coherent spins, percolate in the system. The transition corresponding to this point, for clusters defined by eq.([\ref=solxy]), is in the random percolation universality class.

The occurrence of a finite gap between Tp and Tc is found in Ising spin systems when frustration is present. In this cases a general criterion to close such a gap has been proposed [\cite=BADK] [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1]. Exploiting the results here presented, it is possible to apply such a criterion to frustrated and unfrustrated O(n) models too, and in perspective give a percolative description of their critical behaviors in analogy to the known results for Ising like models. This approach would lead to a change of the bond probability distribution given in eq.([\ref=solxy]). In unfrustrated and frustrated Ising models a definite physical origin has been associated to the percolation point Tp [\cite=conglasses]. It is then natural to speculate on it in continuous spin models too.

The criterion introduced in [\cite=BADK] [\cite=noistessi] [\cite=artic1] is actually suited to develop efficient MC cluster algorithms in Ising systems. The perspective to go further in such a direction also for O(n) models, is very appealing.
