Abstract

Solutions of the Born-Infeld theory, representing strings extending from a Dirichlet p-brane, are also solutions of the higher derivative generalization of the Born-Infeld equations defining an exact open string vacuum configuration.

October 1997

In recent work [\cite=calmal] [\cite=gibbons] [\cite=howeetal], Born-Infeld non-linear electrodynamics was shown to have solutions describing macroscopic strings extending from a Dirichlet p-brane. Fluctuations that are transverse to both the p-brane and the string satisfy a wave equation that interpolates between the two-dimensional physics of the string worldsheet and p  +  1-dimensional wave propagation in the brane worldvolume [\cite=calmal]. This system was studied further in [\cite=lpt], where the Born-Infeld solutions were extended to the case of strings emanating from multiple coincident p-branes and the dynamics of transverse fluctuations compared to corresponding supergravity calculations. The gauge theory and supergravity calculations are in agreement even at parameter values for which derivatives of the gauge field strength are large in the region of interest. This is surprising given that the Born-Infeld theory is only the leading approximation, valid for slowly varying fields, to the open string effective action, and is not expected to be reliable when field gradients are large.

In this paper we show that the Born-Infeld string solution in fact satisfies the beta function equations that generalize Born-Infeld theory to all orders in worldsheet perturbation theory. In other words, it defines a boundary conformal field theory. It is the only known exact vacuum configuration of open superstring theory that has non-constant gauge field strength.

The worldvolume theory of a Dirichlet p-brane is a p  +  1-dimensional U(1) gauge theory coupled to scalar fields φρ that describe the transverse displacement of the brane worldvolume. For slowly varying fields it is given by the dimensional reduction of D=10 supersymmetric Born-Infeld electrodynamics: Fαβ for [formula] is the field strength of the abelian gauge field on the worldvolume; Fαρ  =  ∂αφρ for [formula]; and Fρσ = 0 since the φρ are only functions of worldvolume coordinates. We will ignore the gravitational backreaction due to the gauge field and work in flat spacetime throughout. The Born-Infeld equation of motion is

[formula]

The Born-Infeld string solution has only one of the scalar fields, φ9, excited and it satisfies

[formula]

where Eα is the electric field due to a point charge (or more generally a collection of point charges) in the p-brane worldvolume. The choice of sign corresponds to a string extending in the positive or negative x9 direction.

It is convenient to combine the non-vanishing components of the gauge field and the scalar into a p  +  2-dimensional matrix,

[formula]

where [formula] is the spatial gradient on the worldvolume, and χ  =    ±  1. For an ansatz of this form the Born-Infeld equation ([\ref=bieq]) reduces to Laplace's equation,

[formula]

whose general solution describes any number of strings attached to the p-brane at various locations [\cite=calmal] [\cite=gibbons] [\cite=howeetal]. These solutions are easily extended to the case of multiple coincident p-branes [\cite=lpt]. Then the worldvolume gauge theory is non-abelian but the string configurations only involve an abelian subsector of the full theory.

All these string solutions have regions where the Born-Infeld theory, which was used to derive them in the first place, breaks down. This is illustrated by the example of a single string extending from r = 0, where [formula] is a radial worldvolume coordinate,

[formula]

Here bp is the unit of U(1) charge in the worldvolume theory. Near r = 0 the field strength is large, but more significantly it has large derivatives and is therefore not slowly varying. In deriving the Born-Infeld effective action one ignores contributions that involve derivatives of Fμν and this is only justified if [formula] for all N  ≥  1 (in string units where α' = 1).

Going beyond the Born-Infeld approximation involves the study of open superstrings in a general abelian gauge field background. In a worldsheet sigma model approach this amounts to introducing a supersymmetric Wilson line boundary interaction,

[formula]

and carrying out a systematic perturbative analysis [\cite=andtse] [\cite=clny]. We find it convenient to use a worldsheet background field expansion, Xμ  =  X̄μ  +  πμ. The Wilson line gives rise to three gauge invariant interaction vertices at N-th order in quantum fields, where N  ≥  2,

[formula]

The background field effective action is the sum of all 1PI vacuum diagrams for the fermions and π-fields [\cite=dewabb]. In the absence of of closed string background fields, all interactions take place at the worldsheet boundary and we only need to consider the worldsheet propagators restricted to the boundary,

[formula]

The perturbation expansion contains linearly and logarithmically divergent diagrams that require regularization and renormalization. The linear divergences will cancel due to worldsheet supersymmetry but the logarithmic ones give rise to a non-trivial beta function βAμ(X̄) for the Wilson line coupling, which must vanish for a consistent open-string vacuum configuration. At one-loop order the vanishing of the beta function is equivalent to the Born-Infeld equation ([\ref=bieq]) [\cite=acny] [\cite=leigh]. Beyond one loop the beta function receives contributions involving higher derivatives of Fμν in various combinations. Explicit two-loop calculations in [\cite=andtse] showed that for open superstrings the Born-Infeld equation is in fact not corrected by terms with three derivatives, (i.e. [formula], [formula], or [formula]), but a non-vanishing contribution involving five derivatives was identified. There is every reason to expect further corrections at higher orders but fortunately their detailed structure will not be required here.

Our proof that the ansatz ([\ref=ansatz]) defines an exact open string vacuum relies on simple algebraic properties of that particular field configuration, which ensure that all possible higher-order corrections to the Born-Infeld equation must in fact vanish. A similar line of reasoning has been used to show that certain closed string backgrounds with a null symmetry, such as plane-fronted waves, define exact conformal field theories [\cite=akhs].

Let us define for each p-vector [formula] the p  +  2-dimensional matrix

[formula]

with χ  =    ±  1. Such matrices satisfy,

[formula]

for any vectors [formula], [formula], and [formula].

The field strength tensor ([\ref=ansatz]) and all its derivatives [formula] are matrices of this type and this allows us to make statements about general diagrams in the perturbation expansion. Any graph that contributes to the gauge field beta function will have precisely one vertex of type-1 in ([\ref=vertices]). All other vertices in the diagram are either of type-2 or type-3 and they combine in such a way that all fermions and π-fields are contracted, for otherwise this would not be a vacuum diagram for the quantum fields. An example of a diagram of this type is shown in Figure 1.

Now, let us analyze an arbitrary diagram that contributes to βAμ(X̄). We first observe that any diagram with vertices of type-3 in ([\ref=vertices]), i.e. with one or more closed fermion loops, vanishes for our ansatz. This is because the fermion propagators contract the indices of the field strengths at the type-3 vertices so that we have a trace. Each field strength will in general have some number of derivatives acting on it but that is still a matrix of the form ([\ref=mdef]). It follows from ([\ref=tracetwo]) and ([\ref=nilpot]) that the trace of a product of any number of such matrices vanishes.

We therefore only need to consider purely bosonic diagrams with one vertex of type-1 in ([\ref=vertices]) and any number of type-2 vertices. We proceed in a few steps, starting at the type-1 vertex, which contributes the factor

[formula]

for some value of N  ≥  2. Note that the [formula] is contracted against an index on the field strength and not one of the derivatives. We now follow the internal leg of the diagram that contracts onto the other index μN, of the field strength. This leads us to one of two possibilities: (i) The leg could contract back onto the type-1 vertex; or (ii) contract onto one of the type-2 vertices. Let us consider each case in turn.

(i) In this case we have a derivative contracted onto the field strength, [formula], and this vanishes for our ansatz ([\ref=ansatz]) when φ9 satisfies the Laplace equation ([\ref=scalarlap]).

(ii) Here our next step depends on whether the leg we are following contracts: (a) onto an index on one of the derivatives acting on the field strength F at the second vertex; or (b) onto an index of F itself.

In case (ii-a) we can use the Bianchi identity

[formula]

to 'move' the derivative index onto the field strength, thereby reducing this case to (ii-b) which we discuss next.

In case (ii-b) we consider the remaining index of the field strength at the second vertex. If we follow the leg of the diagram that contracts onto this index we are led to three distinct possibilities: (1) The leg contracts back onto the same vertex; (2) it contracts onto a third vertex; or (3) it contracts back onto the original type-1 vertex. Again we discuss each case in turn.

(ii-b-1) The diagram vanishes for the same reason as in case (i).

(ii-b-2) Here there are two possibilities. The second internal leg either contracts onto an index of the field strength at the third vertex or onto an index of a derivative acting on F. In the latter case we can use the Bianchi identity to move the index from the derivative to F itself and proceed from there. When the leg contracts onto an index of F we have a sequence of three matrices of the form ([\ref=mdef]) contracted together and this vanishes by the nilpotence property ([\ref=nilpot]).

(ii-b-3) Finally we have to consider the case where the second leg leads back to the first type-1 vertex. We know that it must contract onto an index of a derivative there since both indices of the field strength are already accounted for. By using the Bianchi identity at the type-1 vertex, combined with the antisymmetry of F at the second vertex, we can move the index that contracts with the background field [formula] onto the derivative of the field strength at the type-1 vertex. The diagram then contains a factor of the form,

[formula]

which means that it vanishes by the trace property ([\ref=tracetwo]).

We have shown that all open string tree diagrams that could contribute to the Wilson line beta function βAμ(X̄) vanish for field configurations that describe Born-Infeld strings. The argument relies on the special algebraic form of the Born-Infeld string solution but is independent of the renormalization scheme used to define the beta function. Since the diagrams involving fermions vanish separately from the diagrams involving only bosons, it is clear that the Born-Infeld string is also an exact solution of the bosonic open string theory. Our analysis is limited to open string theory at the classical level. It does not include closed string backgrounds and no open string loop diagrams.

We have chosen to look at the spacetime equations of motion of the gauge field rather than its supersymmetry properties. Our success in showing that they are satisfied to all orders in worldsheet perturbation theory is nevertheless no doubt due to the fact that these are supersymmetric configurations. In fact the ansatz, ∂αφ9  =    ±  Eα, was originally arrived at from BPS considerations in the linearized Maxwell approximation to the Born-Infeld theory [\cite=calmal] [\cite=gibbons]. An alternative approach to the one presented here would be to investigate higher order corrections to supersymmetry variations, and show that they all vanish for Born-Infeld strings.
