Some functionals on compact manifolds with boundary

introduction

In this work we discuss critical points of two functionals defined on the space of Riemannian metrics on a compact manifold with boundary. Let Ω be an n-dimensional, connected, compact manifold with smooth boundary Σ which itself is not necessarily connected. Given a Riemannian metric g on Ω, let

[formula]

where (g), Sg are the Ricci curvature, the scalar curvature of g, respectively, and λ∈{0,1, - 1}. Let X be a vector field on Ω. Define

[formula]

where νg is the outward unit normal to Σ in (Ω,g) and dγg denotes the volume element on Σ induced by g.

We will be interested in FX(  ·  ) constrained to the space of constant scalar curvature metrics on Ω. To be precise, we assume that g0 is a given, smooth metric on Ω such that Sg0  =  λn(n - 1). If λ  >  0, we assume that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of (n - 1)Δg0  +  Sg0 is positive. Let γ be the metric on Σ induced from g0. Define Here, in the definition of Mλγ, T(Σ) denotes the tangent bundle of Σ. Evidently, g0∈Mλ and Mλ0  ⊂  Mλγ  ⊂  Mλ.

To state our result, we will assume X is a conformal Killing vector field on (Ω,g0), see (a2) in section [\ref=s-conformal]. Under this assumption, it is known (cf. [\cite=Herzlich]) that

[formula]

where "g0" is the divergence with respect to g0 and [formula] denotes the kernel of the operator DS*g0(  ·  ), which is the formal L2-adjoint of the linearization of the scalar curvature map S at g0, i.e.

[formula]

for any function f. In a relativistic context, a nontrivial solution f to DS*g0(f)  =  0 is often referred as a static potential. Motivated by the work of Corvino [\cite=Corvino] on localized scalar curvature deformation, we seek a variational characterization of the condition "[formula]", which is part of the following theorem.

Let (Ω,g0), Mλ, Mλγ and Mλ0 be described as above. Suppose X is a conformal Killing vector field on (Ω,g0). Let {g(t)}|t|  <  ε be a smooth path of metrics on Ω such that g(0)  =  g0. Then

[formula] for all path {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλ0 if and only if [formula].

[formula] for all path {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλγ if and only if [formula] and νg0 is an eigenvector of 〈X,νg0〉Gg0 with zero eigenvalue at every point on Σ.

If g0 is Einstein, then [formula] for all path {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλ. The converse is true if there is a function u such that g0X  -  X(u) has a fixed sign on a dense subset in Ω, which is satisfied if g0X does not vanish on Ω.

The use of the functional FX(  ·  ) in Theorem [\ref=t-main-1] is largely motivated by corresponding expressions of the mass functionals of asymptotically flat and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. On an asymptotically flat manifold (Mn,g), the ADM mass [\cite=ADM61] [formula] can be computed by

[formula]

where cn  <  0 is a dimensional constant, Sr denotes the coordinate sphere of radius r in the asymptotically flat end of (M,g), and

[formula]

is the conformal Killing vector field on the Euclidean space [formula]. For the origin and the proof of [\eqref=eq-mass-AF], we refer readers to [\cite=Ashtekar-Hansen] [\cite=Chrusciel] [\cite=Huang-ICCM] [\cite=MiaoTam2015] [\cite=Herzlich] [\cite=WangWu2015]. On an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold, formulae analogous to [\eqref=eq-mass-AF], which compute the mass functionals introduced in [\cite=Chrusciel-Herzlich], can be found in [\cite=Herzlich].

The second functional that we are interested in is also related to [\eqref=eq-mass-AF]. Indeed, it is not hard to see that one can replace [formula] in [\eqref=eq-mass-AF] by X  =  rνg (cf. [\cite=MiaoTamXie16]) to obtain

[formula]

where one has also used the Gauss equation and H2, H02 denote the second order mean curvature of Sr in (M,g), [formula], respectively. (Here one assumes that Sr can be isometrically embedded in [formula] which is always satisfied when n = 3). We recall that the second order mean curvature H2 of a hyersurface S in a Riemannian manifold (M,g) is given by

[formula]

where [formula], A and H are the principal curvatures, the second fundamental form and the (first order) mean curvature of S in (M,g), respectively. For a generalization of [\eqref=eq-mass-AF-2], we refer readers to Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=MiaoTamXie16].

Motivated by [\eqref=eq-mass-AF-2], given a nontrivial function φ on Σ  =  ∂Ω, we define

[formula]

where H2(g) is the second order mean curvature of Σ in (Ω,g) with resect to νg. Regarding Eφ(  ·  ), we have

Let (Ω,g0) and Mλγ be described as above. Let Hg0 be the mean curvature of Σ in (Ω,g0). Let {g(t)}|t|  <  ε denote a smooth path of metrics on Ω such that g(0)  =  g0. Then

[formula]

if and only if the following conditions hold

φ  Hg0 is the boundary value of some [formula].

Σ is umbilical at every point p∈Σ where [formula].

We give some remarks about Theorem [\ref=t-main-2].

Besides [\eqref=eq-mass-AF-2], our motivation to study Eφ(  ·  ) on Mλγ also comes from a corresponding result on a weighted total mean curvature functional in [\cite=MiaoShiTam09]. More precisely, if we let

[formula]

where H(g) is the usual mean curvature of Σ in (Ω,g), it was proved in [\cite=MiaoShiTam09] that g0 is a critical point of E(1)φ(  ·  ) in Mλγ if and only if φ is the boundary value of some element [formula].

If (Ω,g0) has a conformal Killing vector field X such that X does not vanish along Σ and is orthogonal to Σ, then every point in Σ is umbilical (see Proposition [\ref=p-2ndmean] in Section 4).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=s-conformal], we discuss properties of manifolds of constant scalar curvature admitting a conformal Killing vector field. In Section [\ref=s-F], we prove Theorem [\ref=t-main-1]. In Section [\ref=s-meancurvature], we prove Theorem [\ref=t-main-2].

Manifolds with a conformal Killing vector field

Let Ω, Σ be given as in the introduction. Let g0 be a Riemannian metric on Ω satisfying

g0 has constant scalar curvature λn(n - 1), with λ = 0,1 or - 1, where n is the dimension of Ω;

(Ω,g0) has a conformal Killing vector field X, i.e.

[formula]

where η is the 1-form dual to X with respect to g0 and " [formula] " denotes the covariant differentiation on (Ω,g0).

For simplicity, we let f  =  g0X and denote Gg0λ by G. For any smooth symmetric (0,2) tensor h, computing in a local orthonormal frame {ei}1  ≤  i  ≤  n, we have where summation is taken over any pair of repeated indices and (a2) is applied. Therefore,

[formula]

Now let h = g0. By [\eqref=e-Lie-Co], (a2) and the fact Sg0  =  λn(n - 1),

[formula]

To proceed, we adopt an argument of Herzlich [\cite=Herzlich]. Let {φt}|t|  <  ε be the 1-parameter family of local diffeomorphisms generated by X. Let gt  =  φ*t(g0), then gt = e2utg0 for some smooth function u(  ·  ,t)  =  ut(  ·  ) with u0 = 0. Let [formula]. By (a2) and the fact [formula],

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Taking the t-derivative and letting t = 0, we have

[formula]

Hence, by [\eqref=e-divx-v] and [\eqref=e-Lie-Ric],

[formula]

Taking trace of [\eqref=eq-Lie-end] and using [\eqref=e-Lie-Co-1], we conclude that (i) and (ii) of the lemma hold.

If g0 is Einstein, then Gg0λ  =  0, which implies DS*g0(g0X) = 0 by Lemma [\ref=lma-Phi] (ii). (This was the content of [\cite=Herzlich].) Next we show that the reverse is true under certain boundary and interior conditions.

Let (Ω,g0) satisfying conditions (a1), (a2). Suppose

DS*g0(g0X)  =  0,

〈X,νg0〉|Gg0|2  ≥  0 along Σ, and

there exists a smooth function u on Ω such that g0X  >  X(u) on a dense subset of Ω.

Then g0 is Einstein in Ω.

Denote Gg0λ by G. By (i) and Lemma [\ref=lma-Phi],

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Multiplying [\eqref=eq-pde-G] by a function φ and integrating on Ω, we have where dVg0 denotes the volume element of g0. Hence,

[formula]

Letting φ = eu, by (ii) we have

[formula]

By (iii), we conclude that [formula] and g0 is Einstein.

Proposition [\ref=p-Einstein] implies that, if [formula] with 〈X,νg0〉  ≥  0 along Σ and g0X  >  0 in Ω, then g0 is Einstein.

Critical points of FX(  ·  )

Let g0 be a metric on Ω satisfying conditions (a1), (a2). In this section, we consider the functional FX(  ·  ) near g0.

Let η(t) be the 1-form dual to X with respect to g(t). Let " ; " denote the covariant derivative on (Ω,g(t)). Let dVg(t) be the volume element of g(t). Denote Gg(t)λ by Gt. By the contracted Bianchi identity, g(t)Gt = 0. Hence, FX(g(t)) can be rewritten as

[formula]

where [formula].

At t = 0, (a1) and (a2) imply

[formula]

and

[formula]

where f  =  g0X. Using the fact

[formula]

one has

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, by [\eqref=e-1stvar-1] - [\eqref=e-1stvar-5] and [\eqref=e-Lie-Co], we have

[formula]

(i) now follows from [\eqref=e-1stvar-6] and Lemma [\ref=lma-Phi](ii). When h|T(Σ) = 0, one easily checks that the following formula

[formula]

holds for any function w on Ω (cf. (34) in [\cite=MiaoTam08] and (2.3) in [\cite=MiaoShiTam09]). Hence (ii) is true.

(i) For a variation {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλ0, one has h  =  0 at Σ and DSg0(h)  =  0 on Ω. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lma-1stvar-1](i),

[formula]

Therefore, if [formula], then [formula].

To see the converse is true, let [formula] be an arbitrary symmetric (0,2) tensor on Ω. Since the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of (n - 1)Δg0  +  Sg0 is assumed to be positive, by the proof of [\cite=MiaoTam08], one can find a positive function u(x,t)  =  ut(x), with x∈Ω and |t|  <  δ for some small δ, such that u0  =  1 on Ω, [formula] has the same constant scalar curvature as g0 and ut = 1 at Σ for all t. Such a variation {g(t)} satisfies

[formula]

with h  =   at Σ. To proceed, we can choose [formula] to have compact support in Ω for instance. Then, by [\eqref=e-pf-df-1], [\eqref=e-g-h] and Lemma [\ref=lma-Phi] (i), which readily shows DS*g0(g0X)  =  0.

(ii) Denote Gg0λ by G0 for simplicity. If [formula] and νg0 is an eigenvector of 〈X,νg0〉G0 with zero eigenvalue everywhere at Σ, then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lma-1stvar-1](i) and the fact h|T(Σ)  =  0.

Conversely, suppose [formula] for all {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλγ, then [formula] by (i). Now let [formula] be any symmetric (0,2) tensor with |T(Σ)  =  0. By the same construction of {g(t)} used in (i), we have

[formula]

Let Q = 〈X,νg0〉G0 and choose [formula] such that

[formula]

where u, v are tangent vectors to Ω at Σ and uT, vT denote the project of u, v to the tangent space to Σ, respectively. With this choice of [formula], [\eqref=eq-pf-df-3] implies Q(νg0,u)  =  0 for any u tangent to Ω at Σ. Therefore, νg0 is an eigenvector of Q with zero eigenvalue.

(iii) If g0 is Einstein, then G0 = 0 and [formula]. Hence [formula] for all variation {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλ by Lemma [\ref=lma-1stvar-1](i). Next, suppose [formula] for all such {g(t)}. Then [formula] by (i) and the same construction of {g(t)} used in (i) shows that [\eqref=eq-pf-df-3] holds for any symmetric (0,2) tensor [formula] on Ω. Let ψ be any extension of the function 〈X,νg0〉g0 to Ω. Let   =  ψG0, it then follows from [\eqref=eq-pf-df-3] that By Proposition [\ref=p-Einstein], we conclude that g0 is Einstein.

Critical points of Eφ(  ·  )

Let g0 be a metric on Ω satisfying (a1). Let Hg0 be the mean curvature of Σ in (Ω,g0). In this section, we discuss the behavior of Eφ(  ·  ) near g0 in Mλγ.

Since 2H2 = H2 - |A|2, where we also have used the fact g(t)|T(Σ)  =  γ.

The outward unit normal νg(t) of Σ in (Ω,g(t)) is given by

[formula]

Let Γkij, [formula] denote the Christoffel symbols, the covariant differentiation of g(t), respectively. Then Therefore, which gives [\eqref=eq-dAt].

Suppose φ is a nontrivial function on Σ such that

φ  Hg0 is the boundary value of some [formula];

Σ is umbilical in (Ω,g0) at every point p∈Σ where [formula].

Then [formula] for any path {g(t)}  ⊂  Mλγ with g(0)  =  g0.

Condition (ii) simply means [formula] wherever φ  ≠  0 along Σ. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-1], where the functional E(1)(  ·  )(  ·  ) is defined in Remark [\ref=rmk-mt08]. But

[formula]

by condition (i) and [\cite=MiaoShiTam09]. Hence the result follows.

Next we want to show that the converse of Proposition [\ref=p-2ndmean-1] is also true. This is proved in the next two lemmas.

Let [formula] be any symmetric (0,2) tensor with compact support in Ω. By [\cite=MiaoTam08], one can find a positive function u(x,t)  =  ut(x), with x∈Ω and |t|  <  δ for some small δ, such that u0  =  1 on Ω, ut  =  1 at Σ and [formula]. Let h  =  g'(0), then [formula], where [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-1], this path {g(t)} satisfies

[formula]

We claim that, for such a variation, one indeed has

[formula]

If this is true, then [\eqref=eq-var-E] shows [formula] for this path {g(t)}. Therefore, by the same proof of [\cite=MiaoShiTam09], the result follows.

To prove [\eqref=e-2ndmean-1], we note that, along Σ, because [formula] has compact support and g0nβ = 0. Here "," denotes partial derivative. Similarly because v = 0 at Σ. By Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-2], we have

[formula]

Thus, as [formula] is traceless. Hence, [\eqref=e-2ndmean-1] is true. This completes the proof.

By Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-3], φHg0 is the boundary value of a function in [formula]. Hence, by [\cite=MiaoShiTam09], for any variation {g(t)}  ⊂  MKγ. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-1],

[formula]

for all such paths.

Now let p∈Σ with φ(p)  >  0 for instance. Let η  ≥  0 be a smooth function with support near p such that η(p) = 1 and η(q) > 0 implies φ(q) > 0. Let [formula] be a symmetric (0,2) tensor on Ω such that |T(Σ)  =  0, (νg0,w)  =  0 for all w tangential to Σ and (νg0,νg0)  =  1 along Σ. By [\cite=MiaoTam08], there exists a positive function u(x,t)  =  ut(x), with x∈Ω and |t|  <  δ for some small δ, such that u0  =  1 on Ω, ut  =  1 at Σ and

[formula]

Let h  =  g'(0), then [formula], where [formula]. At Σ, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-2] and [\eqref=e-2ndmean-2] - [\eqref=e-2ndmean-4], Plugging it to [\eqref=eq-pf-df-5] gives Since [formula] and η(p)φ(p) > 0. We conclude [formula].

Theorem [\ref=t-main-2] in the introduction now follows directly from Proposition [\ref=p-2ndmean-1], Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-3] and Lemma [\ref=l-2ndmean-4].

We end this paper with a proposition relating Theorems [\ref=t-main-1] and [\ref=t-main-2], followed by an example.

Let (Ωn,g0) be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary Σ. Suppose X is a conformal Killing vector field on (Ω,g0) such that X does not vanish along Σ and is normal to Σ. Then every point in Σ is umbilical and the mean curvature Hg0 of Σ satisfies

[formula]

As a result, if S(g0) = λn(n - 1) and if [formula] for all variation {g(t)}|t| < ε  ⊂  Mλ0, then [formula] for all variation {g(t)}|t| < ε  ⊂  Mλγ, where φ  =  〈X,ν0〉.

By the assumption on X, νg0 = X / 〈X,νg0〉 at Σ. Let {ei}1  ≤  i  ≤  n be a local orthonormal frame with en  =  νg0 at points in Σ. Then the second fundamental form A of Σ is given by for 1  ≤  α,β  ≤  n - 1, where η is the 1-form dual to X on (Ω,g0). Hence,

[formula]

which proves the first statement of the proposition.

Next, suppose S(g0) = λn(n - 1) and [formula] for all variation {g(t)}|t| < ε  ⊂  Mλ0. Then, by Theorem [\ref=t-main-1] (i), [formula]. Hence, by [\eqref=eq-H-final] and Theorem [\ref=t-main-2], [formula] for all variation {g(t)}|t| < ε  ⊂  Mλγ.

Example Consider a warped product (Ωn,g)  =  (I  ×  N,dr2  +  f2(r)) where [formula] is a closed interval, (N,) is a closed Riemannian manifold N, and f is a smooth positive function on I. Consider a vector field X = φ(r)∂r, where φ is any smooth function on I. The 1-form dual to X is η  =  φ(r)dr. Let {xi}1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 be local coordinates of N and let xn = r. The Christoffel symbols {Γnij} of g are given by Since ij = f- 2gij, we have From this, one concludes that [formula], 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, if and only if φ' = (f'φ) / f, which is equivalent to φ = cf for some constant c. Now set φ = f, then gX = nf'. Note that this X is never zero on ∂Ω and is normal to ∂Ω. Classification for f' being in [formula] can be found in [\cite=Kobayashi] [\cite=KobayashiObata].
