Complex Symmetric Composition Operators on H2

Introduction

In this paper, we are interested in composition operators on the classical Hardy space H2. This Hilbert space is given by the set of analytic functions [formula] on the open unit disk [formula] such that

[formula]

A composition operator [formula] on H2 is given by [formula]. When φ is an analytic self-map of [formula], Cφ is necessarily bounded. A Toeplitz operator Tψ on H2 is given by Tψf  =  ψf when ψ∈, the space of bounded analytic functions on [formula]. We occasionally write   =  Tψ and call such an operator a weighted composition operator. When φ is linear-fractional, [formula] has a simple form which involves composition operators and (adjoints of) Toeplitz operators, which we will put to use later in this paper.

The weak normality properties of composition operators and weighted composition operators on H2 have been of great interest. For example, work has been done on when Cφ and Wψ,φ are normal [\cite=Bourdon], subnormal [\cite=ck], and cohyponormal [\cite=coko]. In [\cite=Hammond], Garcia and Hammond posed the following problem: "Characterize all complex symmetric composition operators Cφ on the classical Hardy space H2." An operator T on a Hilbert space H is complex symmetric if there exists a conjugate-linear, isometric involution J on H so that T  =  JT*J. We call such an operator J a conjugation. For applications and further information about complex symmetric operators, see [\cite=Garcia1], [\cite=Garcia2] and [\cite=GW].

Due to a result of Garcia and Wogen [\cite=GW], any automorphism of order 2 is complex symmetric. In [\cite=Bourdon1], Bourdon and Noor found that other automorphisms cannot be complex symmetric except possibly for the unsolved case when φ is an elliptic automorphism of order 3. In [\cite=Noor1], Noor found the exact conjugation needed for the involutive disk automorphisms to induce complex symmetric composition operators. Jung, Kim, Ko, and Lee were thought to have found a non-automorphic example in [\cite=jkkl], but were disproved by Noor in [\cite=Noor2]. Noor stated that even a narrower question remains open: does there exist a non-constant and non-automorphic symbol φ for which Cφ is complex symmetric but not normal on H2?

In this paper, we give examples of linear-fractional, non-automorphic maps φ that induce complex symmetric composition operators on H2. In doing so, we answer positively the question of Noor, and we answer in part the question originally posed by Garcia and Hammond. We summarize our results with the following statement.

Let a,b∈ with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1. Then for σ(z)  =  az  +  b(1 - a) and (z)  =  az / (1 - b(1 - a)z), Cσ and Cφ are complex symmetric on H2.

Our strategy will be to first prove the result for linear maps σ with real fixed point b, and from there, we will extend to complex fixed points and then to functions of the form found in φ above. To that end, here we mention the Cowen adjoint formula for composition operators with linear-fractional symbol [\cite=cm1]. The theorem is well-known but we restate it here due to its frequent use throughout the paper.

If [formula] is an analytic self-map of [formula], then on H2, [formula], where [formula], and [formula], and g,h necessarily belong to H∞. The function φ is called the Krein adjoint of σ, while g,h are called the Cowen auxillary functions of σ.

Results

Let J be the operator defined by [formula]. Then J is a conjugation. We will consider when J commutes with other involutions, so that the involution in our construction is conjugate-linear.

Suppose J1 and J2 are isometric involutions which commute, and exactly one of them is conjugate-linear. Then J1J2 is a conjugation.

A product of isometries is an isometry. Since J1J2J1J2  =  J1J2J2J1  =  J1J1  =  I, J1J2 is an involution. Without loss of generality, say J1 is conjugate-linear. Then [formula]. Therefore, J1J2 is a conjugation.

Suppose that ψ∈H∞ and :  →   both map ( - 1,1) into itself. Then J commutes with Tψ and [formula] and therefore also with Wψ,φ.

[formula] and [formula]. Now, for multiplication operators, [formula] and [formula]. In both situations, the expressions agree on ( - 1,1). Since they are the same functions on a set with an accumulation point, they equal each other on the entire open disk.

Suppose [formula] and [formula]. Then TζCτ is unitary and self-adjoint; therefore, it is an isometric involution (but not conjugate-linear). Furthermore, JTζCτ is a conjugation.

The fact that TζCτ is unitary and self-adjoint can be found in both [\cite=Bourdon] and [\cite=wcomp] (the weight ζ is Kτ(0) divided by [formula]). By Theorem [\ref=commute], since b is real, J and TζCτ commute. By Theorem [\ref=conjlinear], then, JTζCτ is a conjugation.

Let a∈,b∈( - 1,1) with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1, and let σ(z)  =  az  +  b(1 - a). Furthermore, let [formula]. Then [formula].

By the Cowen adjoint formula found in Theorem [\ref=adjoint], C*σ  =  TψCφ.

We are now ready to perform some calculations that show Cσ is complex symmetric. We are purposefully letting b belong to ( - 1,1) so that our choice of involution works; however, we will later remove this requirement.

Let a∈,b∈( - 1,1) with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1 and let σ(z)  =  az  +  b(1 - a). Furthermore, let [formula]. Then [formula], where τ,ζ are as in Theorem [\ref=unitary].

We show this by direct calculation:

[formula]

First, we check the compositional symbol. For clarity, we will work this out one composition at a time. Recall that we are assuming b is real.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now, we will evaluate each of the three multiplicative factors separately, and see that they simplify to 1:

[formula]

[formula]

For the third multiplication factor, recall that we have already simplified [formula] above:

[formula]

Putting these together, we have

[formula]

and we are finished.

Let a∈,b∈( - 1,1) with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1 and let σ(z)  =  az  +  b(1 - a). Then Cσ is complex symmetric.

By Theorem [\ref=unitary], JTζCτ is a conjugation. By Theorem [\ref=adjoint2], C*σ  =  Tψ. By Theorem [\ref=mix], [formula].

We now use unitarily equivalence to allow b to be complex.

Let a,b∈ with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1 and let σ(z)  =  az  +  b(1 - a).Then Cσ is complex symmetric.

By Corollary [\ref=breal] , Cσ1 is complex symmetric, where σ1(z)  =  az  +  b1(1 - a) with a∈,b1∈( - 1,1) and |a| + |b1(1 - a)|  ≤  1. Let Uθ be defined by Uθf  =  Ceiθzf  =  f(eiθz) for some angle θ and note that Uθ is a unitary operator with inverse U-  θ. Then U-  θCσ1Uθ is unitarily equivalent to Cσ where σ  =  az  +  eiθb1(1 - a), so it is also complex symmetric. Letting b  =  b1eiθ, since this is true for any angle θ, the conclusion follows.

The work above shows that if σ is a linear symbol with interior fixed point, Cσ is complex symmetric on H2. However, as we will see below, that work also shows that [formula] is complex symmetric, where φ is the Krein adjoint of σ.

Let a,b∈ with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1. Let (z)  =  az / (1 - b(1 - a)z),ψ(z)  =  1 / (1 - b(1 - a)z). Then Wψ,φ is complex symmetric.

=  Cσ, where [formula], is complex symmetric by Corollary [\ref=bdisk]. Since the adjoint of Wψ,φ is complex symmetric, Wψ,φ is also complex symmetric.

Let a,b∈ with |a| + |b(1 - a)|  ≤  1 and let (z)  =  az / (1 - b(1 - a)z). Then [formula] is complex symmetric.

First, recall that zH2 is a reducing subspace for [formula]. Let ψ(z)  =  1 / (1 - b(1 - a)z). By Corollary [\ref=phi], Wψ,φ is complex symmetric and therefore so is a. By the unitary operator Tz:  →  z, a is unitarily equivalent to |z. Therefore, |z is complex symmetric by some conjugation J2:zH2  →  zH2. On H2, [formula] and I is trivially complex symmetric by any conjugation, say J1, on the constants. Then [formula] is complex symmetric on H2 by the conjugation [formula].

Further Questions

We have shown several operators [formula] to be complex symmetric when [formula] is linear-fractional with interior fixed point and no fixed point on the boundary. However, there are other examples, e.g.   =  1 / (3 - z). Are these operators also complex symmetric?

Are there composition operators on H2 that are complex symmetric, yet whose symbols are not linear fractional?
