Quantum Entanglement Percolation

Rapid development of quantum technologies implies that large networks operating with quantum information are to be created in the nearest future [\cite=Kimble:08]. Such quantum networks are superior to their classical ancestors in security [\cite=Gisin:07] and efficiency of communication [\cite=Buhram:01] and exhibit new structures [\cite=Perse:10] and behavior [\cite=Manzano:13], which may be exploited in quantum computation [\cite=Ladd:10] and metrology [\cite=Giov:11]. In general, a network is represented by a graph with nodes connected by links. In quantum networks, the links are typically associated with quantum channels, through which the nodes exchange photons [\cite=Cirac:97]. The photons may be locally measured with subsequent classical communication of the results of the measurements between the nodes.

For efficient communication in a quantum network with certain configuration of nodes and links, perfect long-distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes is to be established. As originally suggested by Acin, Cirac and Lewenstein [\cite=Acin:07], methods of classical percolation theory [\cite=Stauffer:94] can be employed to find the best strategy for entanglement distribution in a network of particular configuration leading to the notion of classical entanglement percolation. Within this notion the communication capacity of a network is described by its percolation transition point, before which the probability to establish a path of perfect entanglement links between two remote nodes is exponentially small, while this probability has a finite asymptotic limit right after it. Since each network configuration relates to the transition point, classical entanglement percolation imposes the fundamental limit on the communication capacity of the network. This limit can be overcame by global change of the network configuration with local operations and classical communication (LOCC) [\cite=Acin:07] [\cite=Kieling:09] [\cite=Pers:08] [\cite=Cuquet:09] [\cite=Pers:10a] [\cite=Cuquet:11]. This strategy employs LOCC to reduce connectivity of a fraction of nodes in the network of initial configuration, concentrating the entanglement between the nodes of a network of more simple final configuration. The quantum graph composed of entanglement links and nodes is thus a subgraph of the classical graph built of the communication channels and nodes. Our approach is the opposite: we employ LOCC to create complex quantum networks with new percolation properties on simple underlying classical networks.

To exemplify our approach, let us consider a 1D chain, where nodes are placed on a line at fixed distances from each other and are connected by channels. Two neighboring nodes may exchange photons through the channels and thus share pure entangled states of qubits, which may be written in the computational basis [\cite=Nielsen:00] as

[formula]

where λ1 and λ2 are the Schmidt coefficients conditioned by λ1  ≥  λ2 and λ1  +  λ2  =  1. A perfect entangled pair with λ1  =  λ2  =  1 / 2 can be converted from the above state with the singlet conversion probability p  =  2λ2 by measurement of one of the qubits from the pair with operators [\cite=Vidal:99]

[formula]

In quantum communication the singlet conversion probability plays the exact role of link occupation probability in percolation theory. Indeed, if the imperfect entangled pairs are distributed between the nodes of a quantum network, each of the pairs is converted to the perfect entanglement link with probability p or vanish with probability 1 - p. By analogy with the percolation theory, we say that perfect entanglement is established between two nodes if there is a path of connected perfect entanglement links between the nodes. While the singlet conversion probability is a natural choice to study the entanglement percolation, we shall also use another measure of entanglement to characterize the process of entanglement distribution - the concurrence [\cite=Wootters:98]. The concurrence for the entangled qubit pair ([\ref=states]) is given by [formula]. Perfect entanglement with concurrence C = 1 is established between two distant nodes if only there is a path of connected entanglement links of average concurrence C = 1 each.

The main ingredient for the advanced quantum information processing is the entanglement swapping [\cite=Pan:98]. If three nodes a - b - c are chained together and the node b shares two qubit pairs in state ([\ref=states]) with the neighbors, the optimal entanglement swapping [\cite=Pers:08] consists of the measurement of the two qubits from the two different entangled pairs at node b in the Bell basis

[formula]

with subsequent classical communication of the results of the measurement to nodes a and c (see Fig. [\ref=fig-1]). The two local entanglement links transform into a single non-local entanglement link with the final state given by

[formula]

with corresponding probabilities (λ21  +  λ22) / 2 and λ1λ2. The entanglement swapping doesn't change the average singlet conversion probability pswap  =  p [\cite=Bose:99] and reduce concurrence [formula] [\cite=Pers:08], where [formula]. The possibility to use LOCC to create a non-local entanglement link, which is beyond the classical 1D network configuration, allows us to create a quantum network with highly unexpected large-scale behavior as we show next.

Let us consider a 1D chain consisting of N nodes. Let each pair of neighboring nodes initially share K qubit pairs in the state ([\ref=states]). Let us take K - 1 qubit pairs and perform entanglement swapping at each second node. After that we take K - 2 qubit pairs and apply the entanglement swapping at each third node. Repeating the above procedure with the entanglement swapping at 2k + 1 nodes for k = 0...K - 2, we construct K - 1 levels of hierarchy of non-local entanglement links over the classical 1D chain formed with local links, as exemplified in Fig. [\ref=fig-2]. This hierarchical network was introduced by Boettcher, Goncalves and Guclu [\cite=Boettcher:08] to study the behavior of the so-called small-world systems [\cite=Watts:98]. But, because the non-local entanglement links are created with LOCC only, they cannot be attributed to the small-world links, which assume non-local interactions between the nodes. Moreover, the nonlocal links don't correspond to classical channels: the physical connectivity of the chain is still one-dimensional. Thus, the hierarchical network created with LOCC has no classical analog and can be called a genuine quantum network, while the entanglement percolation in such a network - the quantum entanglement percolation.

Now, we show that quantum entanglement percolation in the hierarchical quantum network is of exponential benefit over the classical entanglement percolation in 1D. In the classical 1D chain with K entangled pairs between to neighboring nodes, perfect entanglement between two neighboring nodes is established with probability [formula]. The condition for connecting two infinitely distant nodes with a perfect entanglement link reads as

[formula]

where N is the number of nodes between the nodes to be connected. The condition holds true only for [formula] giving us the well-known percolation transition point in the classical 1D chain pt  =  1, i.e. in 1D configuration the perfect entanglement can be created between two infinitely distant nodes if only the perfect entanglement is established between each pair of neighboring nodes.

For the quantum hierarchical network, the probability to connect two neighboring nodes is P0  =  p, while for three nodes P1  =  p  +  (1 - p)P20, where we used the fact that the entanglement swapping doesn't change the singlet conversion probability. Taking into account self-similarity of the chain, we arrive to the recursive formula to find the probability of connecting the border nodes with a path of perfect entangled pairs [\cite=Boettcher:09]

[formula]

for k = 0...K - 2. In the infinite chain N  →    ∞  , thus K  →    ∞   and P∞  =  PK - 1  ≈  PK - 2. The quadratic equation has two solutions interconnected at the non-classical percolation transition point pt = 1 / 2. It is important to stress that, in contrast to standard percolation [\cite=Stauffer:94], before the percolation transition point p  <  1 / 2 there is a finite probability of connecting the border nodes P∞  =  p / (1 - p). However, further analysis [\cite=Boettcher:12] shows, that the probability to connect an arbitrary two nodes of the network with a path of perfect entanglement links is still exponentially small due to exponentially small size of the giant component with respect to the network size. For p  ≥  1 / 2 a path between arbitrary two nodes in the network exists [\cite=Boettcher:12]. Thus the initially distributed entangled states ([\ref=states]) in the hierarchical network with the singlet conversion probability of p  ≥  1 / 2 are sufficient to establish a path of perfect entanglement links between arbitrary two nodes irrespective of the chain length. Taking into account that in the classical 1D chain the perfect entanglement path exists only if p = 1 (and otherwise P∞  =  0), for any p  ≥  1 / 2 quantum entanglement percolation is superior exponentially to the classical entanglement percolation as was announced.

Before we proceed with the percolation properties of the quantum network, we would like to stress that each of the K - 1 levels of hierarchy connects 2K - 1 + 1 nodes into loops with one entangled link between the border nodes. Thus to construct a network of maximal hierarchy on N nodes (i.e. to connect the border nodes with a single entanglement link) one needs to distribute initially 1  +   log 2(N - 1) imperfect entangled pairs between each pair of neighboring nodes in the classical 1D chain. The total number of the imperfect entangled states in the chain of N nodes thus scales as [formula], which is practically feasible.

Studying the quantum entanglement percolation with concurrence gives us further insight into the process of entanglement distribution in the quantum network. Because single entanglement swapping reduces the concurrence of the initial states α  <  1 times, the recursion relation ([\ref=recursion]) is modified as

[formula]

where [formula]. Because αk + 1C  →  0 as k  →    ∞  , the percolation properties of the hierarchical network reduce to the percolation properties of the classical 1D chain [formula] with the classical percolation transition point at Ct  =  1. The reason for the reduction is the decay of entanglement in the non-local entanglement links of higher hierarchy due to multiple entanglement swapping. The decay is exponential with respect to the hierarchy level K - 1, which implies polynomial decay of entanglement with respect to the chain length N, because α  ≤  1 / 2 and [formula].

The effect of the polynomial decay of entanglement can be eliminated using standard protocol for entanglement distillation [\cite=Bennet:96]. Reminding that any two-qubit state is distillable if entangled [\cite=Horodecki:09], let us estimate the amount of initial entanglement to implement the distillation in the hierarchical network. Let us consider the initial classical configuration with K entangled pairs between the neighboring nodes and assuming that all qubit pairs ([\ref=states]) have the amount of entanglement of C  =  1 / 2, which corresponds to the states with Schmidt coefficients [formula]. These states could be unitary transformed into Werner states with fidelity [\cite=Horodecki:09] of the each of the states [formula]. A single entanglement swapping at an arbitrary node of the classical chain results into one of the two states ([\ref=Final-Swapping-1])-([\ref=Final-Swapping-2]). While the state ([\ref=Final-Swapping-2]) requires no distillation, the fidelity of the state ([\ref=Final-Swapping-1]) is given by [formula]. Using the iterative formula for the entanglement distillation

[formula]

we find that F(0)  →  F(8)  >  F, i.e. the entanglement distillation protocol allows to restore the fidelity to the level before the entanglement swapping in just eight iterations. Taking into account that the success probability of the distillation protocol approximates 1 / 4, 32 entangled pairs are required to distill a single entanglement link after an entanglement swapping. In a network with K - 1 levels of hierarchy, the number of entangled pairs before distillation thus scales exponentially as [formula], but because [formula], the total number of initial states to construct the hierarchical network with the average concurrence C  ≥  1 / 2 per entanglement link scales just polynomially [formula]. The distillation procedure is efficient, because targets achieving states with non-unit fidelity F  ≥  3 / 4 at each entanglement link. If each entanglement link in the hierarchical quantum network has the average concurrence C  ≥  1 / 2, the probability to establish a perfect entanglement path between two arbitrary distant nodes is strictly higher then zero as suggested by the percolation properties of the quantum network.

Suggested distillation procedure is not optimal and is shown to demonstrate practically appropriate scaling of the initial resources with the network size. More advanced distillation protocols [\cite=Horodecki:09] may lead to even better scaling. The optimal strategy for the entanglement distillation depends on the optimal strategy for the hierarchical network construction, which is unknown. The Bell state measurements ([\ref=Bell-measurements]) don't maximize the average concurrence after more then one entanglement swapping operations [\cite=Pers:08]. The optimal measurement for multiple entanglement swapping is also unknown.

Presented approach of constructing the non-local hierarchical levels on simple underlying classical networks can be extended beyond 1D classical network configuration [\cite=Boettcher:09]. In particular, the classical 2D square lattice with the classical percolation transition point at p = 1 / 2 can be modified to a hierarchical network with the percolation transition point at p = 5 / 32  ≈  0.16. General analysis of the hierarchical networks is, however, challenging and requires development of new theoretical and numerical tools.

In conclusion, we introduced quantum networks created with LOCC, which exhibit non-classical percolation properties and have quantum communication advantages over corresponding networks with classical configurations. Using the notion of quantum entanglement percolation we showed how to establish long-distance perfect entanglement between two arbitrary nodes in 1D network with imperfect entangled pairs. This result may have implications for practical implementation of quantum networks [\cite=Sangouard:11] and especially with the continuous variable (CV) systems. Taking into account that the quantum network is constructed from the classical network with the entanglement swapping, which could be implemented on the CV systems, and the fact that the perfect CV entangled state cannot be prepared with finite resources [\cite=Pir:15], the quantum entanglement percolation offers the opportunity of faithful long-distance quantum communication with CV imperfect entangled states - the goal hardly achieved in classical 1D network configuration.

Apart from announced quantum communication benefits, we, for the first time, showed the distinction between the percolation properties of the classical network configuration (composed of nodes and channels) and the quantum network configuration (consisting of nodes and entanglement links). We showed that the percolation properties of these networks are dramatically different, although they both correspond to the physical 1D configuration. This result suggests a study of structural complexity of entanglement graphs that can be simulated on a given quantum network [\cite=Siomau:16].

The hierarchical networks exhibit property of explosive percolation [\cite=Boettcher:12] - the sudden emergence of large-scale connectivity in a network [\cite=Souza:15]. The fact that the hierarchical networks may be created and operated locally opens intriguing possibilities for experimental testing of the explosive percolation, which may eventually achieve the long-standing goal of the statistical physics - put the percolation transition under control.

Finally because the quantum networks exhibit new percolation transition points, we may expect all-new percolation properties, which may lead to the construction of new local theory of percolation in quantum networks with new unexpected technological applications.
