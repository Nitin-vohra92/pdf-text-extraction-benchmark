Atomic probes of new physics

Introduction

The standard model of particle physics (SM) is one of the most successful scientific theories. Yet, it cannot be a complete description of nature because, for example, it does not provide a viable dark matter candidate and cannot account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Colliders are one of the main tools to study elementary particles and the LHC is pushing forward the energy frontier. A complementary and vital role is played by low-energy precision experiments. In this context, atomic physics has been mostly used to test violation of fundamental laws such as parity violation (see, e.g., [\cite=Porsev:2009pr] [\cite=Tsigutkin:2009zz] [\cite=PhysRevA.81.032114] [\cite=Leefer:2014tga] [\cite=Versolato:2011zza] [\cite=Dzuba:2012kx] [\cite=Roberts:2014bka] [\cite=Jungmann:2014kia]), Lorentz symmetry violation [\cite=Dzuba:2015xva] [\cite=Flambaum:2015rwt] and even the time variation of fundamental constants of nature [\cite=Godun:2014naa] [\cite=Rosenband1808].

It was recently proposed in Ref. [\cite=Delaunay:2016brc] that atomic physics can also constrain the Higgs couplings to electrons and neutrons. In the following we explore the power of the suggested measurement to set bounds on a broader set of physics scenarios beyond the SM (BSM).

BSM probes with isotope shift spectroscopy

The suggested experimental setup is sensitive to spin-independent interactions between electrons and neutrons via the energy level shifts of the electrons inside an atom. As the current theoretical precision is still far from meeting the experimental one, determining the absolute frequency shift is not feasible. Instead one can measure the differences in isotope frequency shifts (IS). This amounts to trading off the unknown theoretical parameters with experimental ones. In such an approach, the shift in energy levels is factorized to a high degree into a product of a function that solely depends on the electronic degrees of freedom and a function that depends on the nuclear physics ones. Within the validity of this factorization and in the non-relativistic limit [\cite=Delaunay:2016brc], a linear relation between the energy level (rescaled by the isotope mass difference) of two different transitions as a function of the isotope number is obtained. This is known as King linearity, or King law [\cite=King:63] [\cite=King:13]. New interactions that couple electrons to neutrons, generically lead to a non-linear relation [\cite=Delaunay:2016brc]. We shall denote such an effect as King law violation (KLV). The absence of a deviation from linearity allows to constrain the new physics (NP) contributions.

As long as the NP scale is at or above the GeV scale, we can treat the NP by an effective field theory (EFT), leading to a short range interaction. Considering spin independent couplings, the NP effects can be parametrized by the following non-relativistic (NR) potential for the electron-nucleus interaction:

[formula]

All other contributions to the NR potential obtained by integrating out heavy mediators depend on the electron and/or the nucleus spin (see, e.g., Ref. [\cite=Fan:2010gt]). The operators in Eq. [\eqref=eq:NReft] and in the Higgs Yukawa potential of Ref. [\cite=Delaunay:2016brc] are equivalent. Therefore the derivation of the limit on a generic V0 follows analogously.

Heavy new degrees of freedom induce the following NR shift in electronic energy levels defined by the principal and angular quantum numbers n, l and m:

[formula]

where the state |nlm〉 solves the Schrödinger equation for a Coulomb potential and |ψ(0)|2 / n3 is the wave function density at the origin for the transiting electron. We assume that the deviation from the linearity in the King plot can be measured with a precision of Δ, where we consider measurements of frequency shifts of Ytterbium isotopes with [formula] or even [formula] [\cite=Delaunay:2016brc] as reference values for our estimations. We thus use the corresponding mass number difference in the following. With these assumptions, V0 of Eq. [\eqref=eq:NReft] can be limited to

[formula]

which can be translated to an inverse energy of 6.7 (21) TeV for Δ = 1(0.1)  . This is close to the energy range that is currently probed by the LHC.

Relativistic effective field theory

In order to compare the above sensitivity to the reach of colliders, we match the non-relativistic to the relativistic EFT and convert the nucleon-electron coupling into the parton-electron coupling. In the following we will do the matching for the only two four-fermion operators that generate the potential given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:NReft] and derive the corresponding KLV bounds on the NP scale Λ.

For the scalar operator

[formula]

with flavor index f, the matching requires to know the matrix elements of the quark currents inside the nucleon which we obtain from Refs. [\cite=Belanger:2008sj] [\cite=Belanger:2013oya]. Eq. [\eqref=SR] then translates into

[formula]

For the vector operator

[formula]

only the valence quarks contribute to the matrix element of the nucleon current [\cite=Belanger:2008sj]; the KLV sensitivity then is

[formula]

Since KLV is sensitive to neutron-electron couplings, the most stringent bounds can be set on Λd for the scalar and vector operators. Yet, despite being a low-energy experiment, KLV is able to constrain also sea quark couplings.

The strongest collider bounds are [formula] from the LHC [\cite=Aad:2014wca] and [formula] from LEP [\cite=Schael:2013ita]. Even though not quoted explicitly, similar bounds are expected for the scalar case since interference effects are not dominant. Therefore, present LHC bounds are weaker than the projected KLV bound for Δ = 1  ; only for an accuracy of [formula] the KLV and LHC bounds are comparable. Comparing to constraints from flavor physics is typically model dependent, hence they are not used in the following.

Comparison with direct probes

We now consider the case where the NP scale is below a few TeV (down to roughly the proton size, i.e., GeV scale) and thus accessible at various colliders. A pure EFT approach is not appropriate anymore, we therefore move to discuss the relevant observables using the following simplified models.

Scalar resonance

We first consider a neutral scalar mediator S  . The relevant couplings are given by the Lagrangian

[formula]

with cxαx = cemαem,cgαs and Xμν = Fμν,Ga  μν  . In order to compare to the EFT KLV bound we set [formula] where MS is the mass of the mediator and cq and ce are the Yukawa couplings of S to electrons and quarks.

The KLV bound for up and down quarks with the couplings evaluated at the TeV scale translates into

[formula]

and for strange quarks into

[formula]

For light scalars, the couplings should instead be evaluated at the few GeV scale, which leads to slightly weaker bounds. If the quark couplings are negligible, we can constrain the gluon coupling,

[formula]

There are known models in which cg and cγ are generated at the matching scale with a similar strength. It is thus necessary to consider the corresponding contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, (g - 2)e [\cite=Jackiw:1972jz] [\cite=Fujikawa:1972fe] [\cite=Leveille:1977rc] [\cite=Haber:1978jt]. For a heavy scalar S the dominant contribution to (g - 2)e stems from the Barr-Zee-type diagram [\cite=Barr:1990vd]. Following the calculation of Refs. [\cite=Ilisie:2015tra] [\cite=Grtz:2015nkpoe] and using Eq. [\eqref=eq:LagS], we obtain the leading contribution

[formula]

where we assumed Λ  ≫  MS. Imposing that |ΔaSe|  ≤  8.1  ·  10- 13 [\cite=Odom:2006zz] [\cite=Hanneke:2010au] [\cite=QED:2011] [\cite=Agashe:2014kda], we find

[formula]

It implies that for [formula], the bound from (g - 2)e is stronger than the KLV one for a heavy scalar. For lighter scalar masses, an additional contribution to (g - 2)e becomes important. It results from a 1-loop diagram proportional to c2e,

[formula]

leading to the bound

[formula]

Let us now consider a Higgs portal scalar model, where the singlet S mixes with the Higgs field with the mixing angle [formula]. Writing ci as yiSθ for i = e,u,d,s, we find

[formula]

with the couplings evaluated at the Higgs mass scale. This rather weak bound leads to an interesting constraint only for large non-standard Yukawa couplings.

The 750 GeV diphoton resonance

The recently reported diphoton excess [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2015-081] [\cite=CMS-PAS-EXO-15-004] motivates to examine in detail the power of KLV for an extension of the SM with a new scalar S at a mass of MS = 750  . The couplings of S to fermions and photons are defined by the Lagrangian in Eq. [\eqref=eq:LagS], and in the following we omit the coupling to gluons as this leads only to very weak bounds from KLV. We take S to be a singlet, which means that the Yukawa couplings between the SM fermions and S arise from a higher-dimensional operator, i.e., [formula]. Therefore, there is an upper bound on the Yukawa couplings depending on the required perturbativity cutoff. For instance, if we require the theory to be perturbative up to 50 TeV, this implies cf < 0.8  . This bound is sufficiently weak and thus the scenario merits a careful study as follows.

For concreteness, we consider the case where S couples exclusively to e, d and γ. By requiring that the diphoton excess is reproduced, i.e., [formula]fb [\cite=Gupta:2015zzs], we express cγ as a function of ce and cd. For the calculation of the quark-initiated production cross section σS we use the NNPDF2.3 LO set [\cite=Ball:2012cx] [\cite=Hartland:2012ia] and moreover also include photo production of the resonance as described, e.g., in Ref. [\cite=Csaki:2016raa]. The latter contributes significantly only for [formula].

Combining the relation for cγ with the demand for a total width of at most ΓS = 45   excludes the light blue shaded area in Fig. [\ref=fig:S750]. Dielectron resonance searches provide additional constraints on the couplings, shown for the ATLAS search at 13 TeV [\cite=Aad:2014cka] (dark blue line), where ΓS is determined by the couplings. If, in contrast, the total width is fixed to 45 GeV independently of the couplings, only the region shaded in dark blue can be excluded. In this case, the missing width is assumed to originate from additional decay channels. The ATLAS search is targeted at new vector bosons, but due to the inclusiveness of the analysis, we expect it to apply also for scalars. A projection for its exclusion power with an integrated luminosity of 100  - 1 is shown by the blue dotted line. To maintain readability we omitted the 8   dilepton search, but checked that it leads to very similar results. Analogous to the dilepton search, the CMS dijet search [\cite=CMS-PAS-EXO-14-005] excludes large values of cd. The green line corresponds to a variable width whereas the green shaded region to ΓS = 45  . Due to the large cγ needed to accommodate the excess, also (g - 2)e plays an important role in constraining the electron and photon couplings. Using Eq. [\eqref=eq:gm2e] and setting Λ = 10  MS leads to the orange exclusion contours for a variable width (solid) and a fixed width (dashed).

Finally, we show in red the limits that can be obtained from KLV with a resolution of Δ = 1  Hz (dashed) and 0.1 Hz (solid). The comparison shows that, depending on the resolution, KLV is comparable to or even better than the direct dielectron searches. In particular, if undetected decay modes broaden the width, the LHC loses sensitivity whereas the KLV bounds remain unchanged.

Since the LHC is a proton machine while KLV is sensitive to neutron couplings, it is advantageous for KLV to consider a scenario with [formula]. Nevertheless, also in the scenario with [formula], KLV still sets stronger limits than the current LHC analyses in a large region of the parameter space. KLV is also sensitive to cs; for cs  ≠  0 = cu = cd and not too small cs it can compete or even surpass LHC limits.

Neutral gauge bosons

We can envision Eq. [\eqref=eq:sv] as coming from integrating out a vector boson and thus rewrite the KLV bound as:

[formula]

This corresponds to probing gauge interactions stronger than 10- 3  GF, where GF is the Fermi constant. However, this strong bound applies only to a specific class of models. First, it is necessary that the new gauge boson couples to neutrons, this requirement already excludes the possibility of setting bounds on dark photons models. Secondly, the bound applies to vectorial couplings, which implies a low sensitivity for instance to models where the gauge coupling has the same structure as the Z0 coupling, e.g., the sequential SM. In this scenario, the coupling strength could be modified by x with respect to the SM and thus it is given by [formula], where [formula] is the SM coupling strength with g2 the SU(2) coupling and θW the Weinberg angle. The KLV bound then reads

[formula]

This weak bound cannot compete with the LHC bounds obtained from dilepton searches that exclude masses below 3.2   at 95% CL for x = 1 at [formula]. Also atomic parity violation experiments provide a stronger bound of [formula] [\cite=Bouchiat:2004sp] and therefore they are a good probe of this scenario for lighter masses. Strong bounds can instead be set to parity conserving models such as U(1)B - L.

U(1)B - L

One of the frequently studied abelian extensions of the SM gauge group is gauging the difference of baryon and lepton number, B - L. All quarks have therefore the same charge zq = 1 / 3 and all leptons zl =  - 1. The group is made anomaly-free by introducing a right handed neutrino for each family. In this model, the coupling is purely vectorial, hence KLV sets the strong bound

[formula]

LEP constrains the B - L model in an EFT approach via the vectorial 4-fermion operators. The strongest bound originates from e+e-  →  l+l- searches, resulting in Λll = 24.6   [\cite=Schael:2013ita] for g2 = 4π. Accordingly, the bound on MZ'B - L and gB - L reads

[formula]

Thus, the KLV bound with Δ  =  1 Hz turns out to be similar to the LEP bound (dark blue straight line in Fig. [\ref=fig:BL]), while KLV with Δ  =  0.1 Hz KLV has an even stronger reach.

Fig. [\ref=fig:BL] compares the sensitivity of direct collider searches with the EFT bounds from LEP and KLV. Among the dilepton resonance searches by ATLAS [\cite=Aad:2014cka] [\cite=ATLASee13] and CMS [\cite=Khachatryan:2014fba] [\cite=CMS:2015nhc], we show the ATLAS limit at 8 TeV [\cite=Aad:2014cka] with 20.3  - 1, which is comparable to the corresponding CMS result. The ATLAS limits at [formula] become stronger than the 8     ones for [formula] and will further improve by a factor of roughly 2 by the end of the LHC run 2 with 100  - 1. These direct searches provide the strongest bounds on the mass MZ' and the new gauge coupling gB - L if the only open decay modes of the Z'B - L are into SM fermions, resulting in [formula] (yellow). If additional channels dilute the BR into ee and μμ, the sensitivity of the dilepton searches is reduced, e.g., for [formula] (orange) or [formula] (red). If the increased total width exceeds the energy resolution of the detector, the LHC limits weaken further. The additional width could be realized by the right-handed neutrinos or by other invisible particles if the Z'B - L is the portal between the SM and the dark sector. In contrast, the bounds from KLV depend purely on the Z'B - L couplings to electrons and neutrons so that they are unaffected by a broader total width.

LEP II conducted searches for narrow resonances in subsequent runs at center-of-mass energies [formula] between the Z-pole and 209    . Hence, each run is most sensitive to a resonance at [formula]. In contrast, lighter states can only be resonantly produced in the presence of initial state photon radiation such that the reduced center-of mass energy matches their mass, which reduces the sensitivity. States heavier than the highest run energy can be constrained only via EFT. We reinterpret the inclusive LEP searches for resonantly produced scalar neutrinos [formula] [\cite=Acciarri:2000uh] [\cite=Abbiendi:1999wm] [\cite=Abreu:2000ap] in terms of a spin-1 Z'B - L resonance by rescaling the bound on the R-parity violating (RPV, see next section) coupling λ232 by the ratio of the branching ratios [formula], where BX  =  (X  →  μμ)  [\cite=Appelquist:2002mw] (dark blue). The bounds on RPV couplings provided for MZ'  ≤  70   [\cite=Acciarri:2000uh] are based on the runs with [formula], seen as sharp peaks. We extrapolate the limit down to 46.8 GeV. However, far below the Z-pole, LEP loses sensitivity. Alternatively, in this mass regime, neutrino-hadron scattering (green) provides significantly weaker bounds [\cite=Carlson:1986cu]. Considering lighter masses, SPEAR ([formula]2.6-7.8 GeV), DORIS (7-11 GeV), and PETRA (12-46.8 GeV) constrain gB - L via hadronic (had) decays [\cite=Carlson:1986cu],

[formula]

in this combined mass range (light blue). For MZ' between 1 and 10 GeV (medium blue), we translate the BaBar [\cite=Lees:2014xha] bounds on the mixing parameter ε of a dark photon γ' with γ into

[formula]

To the best of our knowledge, this collection represents the main experimental constraints which can be directly reinterpreted in terms of Z'B - L searches in the mass range between 1   and a few TeV. The comparison of KLV to these other experimental bounds clearly visualizes the potential of precise isotope shift spectroscopy to constrain the Z'B - L spanning several orders of magnitude. KLV with a resolution of Δ = 1  Hz (dark red, dashed) can compete with LHC bounds and surpasses the tightest of them for [formula]TeV. If the KLV resolution is improved down to 0.1 Hz (dark red, solid), the atomic limit exceeds the LHC for all considered masses. LEP sets the most stringent limits only on the thresholds corresponding to the run energies whereas its overall bound exhibits sizeable gaps in contrast to the continuous, albeit at some masses weaker, KLV bounds. The e+e- colliders at lower energies, especially BaBar, compete with KLV only close to their highest energy reach.

Leptoquarks

Another possible UV-completion for Eq. [\eqref=eq:sv] is provided by models with leptoquarks (LQ), colored scalars with fractional electric charge. Integrating LQ out generates an operator that is related via a Fierz transformation to Eq. [\eqref=eq:sv]. An example of a LQ model is leptonic R-parity violating supersymmetry [\cite=Barbier:2004ez]. In this case the scalar exchanged between the electron and the valence quarks is a squark, and the corresponding term in the superpotential is W  ⊃  λ1iiL1QiDi with i = 1,2. At the LHC, there are dedicated analyses for LQ setting bounds of about 1 TeV on their masses [\cite=Aad:2015caa] [\cite=Khachatryan:2015vaa]. These bounds are strong because LQ are colored particles and hence produced via their QCD couplings, independently of λ. The KLV bound reads

[formula]

Couplings of O(1) are still allowed, however KLV bounds are comparable with existing constraints (see [\cite=Barbier:2004ez] [\cite=Dreiner:2006gu]). Atomic parity violation imposes for instance a bound of [formula].

Note

A similar approach to BSM with KLV was published simultaneously in Ref. [\cite=DelaunaySoreq:2016].
