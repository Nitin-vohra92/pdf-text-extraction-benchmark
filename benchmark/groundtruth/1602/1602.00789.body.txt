Strichartz estimates for the magnetic Schrödinger equation with potentials V of critical decay

Introduction

Consider the Cauchy problem of the magnetic Schrödinger equation in [formula] (n  ≥  3):

[formula]

Here, S is the Schwartz class, and H is the electromagnetic Schrödinger operator

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The magnetic field B is defined by

[formula]

where (DA)ij  =  ∂xiAj, (DA)T denotes the transpose of DA, and Mn  ×  n is the space of n  ×  n real matrices. In dimension n = 3, B is determined by the cross product with the vector field [formula]:

[formula]

In this paper, we consider the Strichartz type estimate

[formula]

where u = eitHf is the solution of problem [\eqref=mS_eq] with solution operator eitH, and study some conditions on A, V and pairs (r,q) for which the estimate holds.

For the unperturbed case of [\eqref=mS_eq] that [formula] and [formula], Strichartz [\cite=St] proved the inequality

[formula]

where eitΔ is the solution operator given by

[formula]

Later, Keel and Tao [\cite=KT] generalized this inequality to the following:

[formula]

holds if and only if (r,q) is a Schrödinger admissible pair; that is, r,q  ≥  2, (r,q)  ≠  (  ∞  ,2) and [formula].

In the purely electric case of ([\ref=mS_eq]) that [formula], the decay |V(x)|  ~  1 / |x|2 has been known to be critical for the validity of the Strichartz estimate. It was shown by Goldberg, Vega and Visciglia [\cite=GVV] that for each ε > 0, there is a counterexample of V = Vε with |V(x)|  ~  |x|- 2 + ε for |x|  ≫  1 such that the estimate fails. As a positive result, Rodnianski and Schlag [\cite=RS] proved

[formula]

for non-endpoint admissible pairs (r,q) (i.e., q > 2) with almost critical decay [formula]. On the other hand, Burq, Planchon, Stalker and Tahvildar-Zadeh [\cite=BPST] established [\eqref=electiric_result] for critical decay [formula] with some technical conditions on V but the endpoint case included. Other than these, there have been many related positive results; see, e.g., [\cite=GS], [\cite=Go], [\cite=BRV], [\cite=FV] and [\cite=BG].

In regard to the purely electric case, the following is the first main result of this paper whose proof is given in section [\ref=sec_A=0].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then there exists a constant cn > 0, depending only on n, such that for any V∈Fp [formula] satisfying

[formula]

estimate [\eqref=electiric_result] holds for all [formula] and q > 2. Moreover, if [formula] in addition, then [\eqref=electiric_result] holds for the endpoint case [formula].

Here, Fp is the Fefferman-Phong class with norm

[formula]

which is closed under translation. From the definition of Fp, we directly get [formula] for all [formula]. Thus the class Fp [formula] clearly contains the potentials of critical decay [formula]. Moreover, Fp [formula] is strictly larger than [formula]. For instance, if the potential function

[formula]

then V need not belong to [formula], but V∈Fp.

According to Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1], for the non-endpoint case, we do not need any other conditions on V but its quantitative bound [\eqref=Cond_Decay_V], so that we can extend and much simplify the known results for potentials |V(x)|  ~  1 / |x|2 (e.g., φ∈L∞(Sn - 1) in [\eqref=example_Fp]), mentioned above. To prove this, we use a weighted estimate developed by Ruiz and Vega [\cite=RV2]. We remark that our proof follows an approach different from those used in the previous works.

Unfortunately, for the endpoint case, we need an additional condition that [formula]. Although [formula] dose not contain the potentials of critical decay, it still includes those of almost critical decay [formula], [formula].

Next, we consider the general (magnetic) case that A or V can be different from zero. In this case, the Coulomb decay |A(x)|  ~  1 / |x| seems critical. (In [\cite=FG], there is a counterexample when [formula]. The case n = 2 is still open.) As an initiative result, Stefanov [\cite=Ste] proved estimate ([\ref=eM_result]), that is,

[formula]

for all Schrödinger admissible pairs (r,q) in n  ≥  3, under some smallness assumption on the potentials A and V. Later, for potentials of almost critical decay [formula] and [formula] [formula], D'Ancona, Fanelli, Vega and Visciglia [\cite=DFVV] established [\eqref=magnetic_result] for all Schrödinger admissible pairs (r,q) in n  ≥  3, except the endpoint case (n,r,q)  =  (3,6,2), under some technical conditions on A and V. Also, there have been many related positive results; see, e.g., [\cite=GST], [\cite=EGS2], [\cite=DF], [\cite=MMT], [\cite=EGS1], [\cite=Go2] and [\cite=FFFP]. Despite all these results, there has been no known positive result on the estimate in case of potentials A of critical decay even in the case [formula].

Now, we state the second main result of the paper whose proof is provided in section [\ref=sec_V=0].

Let n  ≥  3, [formula], V∈Fp [formula], and ε > 0. Assume that the operator [formula] is self-adjoint and positive on L2 and that

[formula]

where cn is the constant in [\eqref=Cond_Decay_V]. Assume also that there is a constant Cε > 0 such that A and [formula] satisfy the almost critical decay condition

[formula]

Lastly, for the trapping component of B as [formula], assume that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

with an additional assumption that [formula] when q = 2.

This result is a refined version of [\cite=DFVV] which relaxes technical assumptions on V therein. To accomplish this, we may decompose the estimate into the case H =  - Δ - 2|A|2 + 2V and the case H =  - Δ2A and then apply Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1] to the former case. We explain this argument in detail in section [\ref=sec_V=0]. Note also that Theorem [\ref=main_thm_2] covers the endpoint case (n,r,q) = (3,6,2). To this end, in section [\ref=sec_CKN_ineq], we investigate an equivalence of norms regarding H and -  Δ in [formula].

In closing this section, we present the following corollary for the case [formula] that slightly reduces the conditions in Theorem [\ref=main_thm_2]. We briefly mention its proof in Remark [\ref=rmk_cor], which is almost identical to that of Theorem [\ref=main_thm_2].

The equivalence of two norms involving H and -  Δ in [formula]

In this section, we investigate some conditions on H and p with which the equivalence

[formula]

holds. This equivalence was studied in [\cite=DFVV] and [\cite=CD] that are of independent interest. We now introduce such an equivalence in an improved form for n = 3, which enables us to include the endpoint estimate also for that dimension.

Given [formula] and [formula] measurable, assume that the operators [formula] and H =   -  ΔA + V are self-adjoint and positive on L2. Moreover, assume that V+ is of Kato class and that A and V satisfy

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some [formula] and C0 > 0. Then the following estimates hold:

[formula]

[formula]

Here, V± denote the positive and negative parts of V, respectively; that is, V+  =   max {V,0} and V-  =   max { - V,0}. Although we only need to consider the special case [formula] of Proposition [\ref=Key_Prop] for the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm_2], we include its general version for the sake of completeness. In doing so, we only prove [\eqref=key_leq_ineq] as estimate [\eqref=key_geq_ineq] is the same as [\cite=DFVV]. When 1 < p < 6, estimate [\eqref=key_leq_ineq] easily follows from the Sobolev embedding theorem. However, in order to extend the range of p over 6, we need a precise estimate which depends on δ in [\eqref=upper_bdd_of_AV]. Towards this, we modify the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality as below.

We first recall the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality:

[formula]

for [formula], [formula], a  ≤  b  ≤  a + 1, [formula], and f∈C∞0. This inequality is a bit more generalized version of the original one [\cite=CKN]; it includes the Sobolev inequality (a = b = 0) and the Hardy inequality (a = 0, ~ b = 1) as special cases. The inequality may be of independent interest; for instance, its best constants, extremal functions and qualitative properties were studied in [\cite=CW] and [\cite=LL]. It is also known that the inequality is closely related to fluid dynamics in terms of the Euler equation or Navier-Stokes equation.

Now, let a = 1 and b = 2 in [\eqref=CKN_ineq_1]; then we have

[formula]

for [formula]. It would be nice to have [\eqref=CKN_ineq_2] when n = 3; however, it is impossible because the left-hand side of [\eqref=CKN_ineq_2] can blow up at x = 0. Accordingly, we slightly modify [\eqref=CKN_ineq_2] for our purpose as below.

Let f be a [formula] function; then

[formula]

Let φ be a smooth function on [formula] such that [formula], [formula] on ( -   ∞  ,3], and [formula] on

[formula]

≤ ,

[formula]

|f(x)| dx ≤ |f(x)| dx.

[formula]

F(x) = .

[formula]

div F(x) = = - .

[formula]

|f(x)| dx ≤ 9 dx + dx .

[formula]

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem_CKN_modi], we obtain a weighted estimate as follows.

Let f be a [formula] function, and suppose a weighted function w satisfies

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

for all [formula].

For all [formula], we directly get

[formula]

from Hölder's inequality in Lorentz spaces and the Sobolev embedding theorem. Also, combining Lemma [\ref=lem_CKN_modi] with Hardy's inequality, we have

[formula]

Interpolating between the two estimates [\eqref=CKN_inter_1] and [\eqref=CKN_inter_2], we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we choose [formula]. Then, for all w satisfying [\eqref=CKN_pf_3] and all [formula], we have

[formula]

Thus Lemma [\ref=lem_CKN_modi_2] is proved.

Finally, we prove Proposition [\ref=Key_Prop]. We use Stein's interpolation theorem to the analytic family of operators Tz  =  Hz  ·  ( - Δ)- z, where Hz and ( - Δ)- z are defined by the spectral theory. Denoting z = x + iy, we can decompose

[formula]

In fact, the operators Hiy and ( - Δ)- iy are bounded according to the following result.

(Proposition 2.2 in [\cite=DFVV]). Consider the self-adjoint and positive operators -  ΔA and H =   -  ΔA + V on L2. Assume that [formula] and that the positive and negative parts V± of V satisfy: V+ is of Kato class and

[formula]

Then for all [formula], the imaginary powers Hiy satisfy the (1,1) weak type estimate

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=Im_est_operator] follows from the pointwise estimate for the heat kernel pt(x,y) of the operator e- tH as

[formula]

Regarding this estimate, one may refer to some references as [\cite=Sim] [\cite=SW] [\cite=CD] [\cite=DSY].

By Lemma [\ref=Im_est_operator], we get

[formula]

Next, consider the operator T1 + iy. If

[formula]

then by [\eqref=x=0_est], we get

[formula]

Applying Stein's interpolation theorem to [\eqref=x=0_est] and [\eqref=x=1_est], we get

[formula]

as

[formula]

Now, we handle the remaining part [\eqref=x=1_goal]; that is, we wish to get the estimate

[formula]

For a Schwartz function f, we can write

[formula]

From Hölder's inequality in Lorentz spaces and the Sobolev embedding theorem, we get

[formula]

for all 1 < r < 3. On the other hand, applying Lemma [\ref=lem_CKN_modi_2] to [\eqref=upper_bdd_of_AV], we get

[formula]

for [formula].

In all, we have

[formula]

and this implies Proposition [\ref=Key_Prop].

The case [formula]: Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1]

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1]. Let [formula] and consider the purely electric Schrödinger equation in [formula]:

[formula]

By Duhamel's principle, we have a formal solution of [\eqref=mS_eq_A=0] given by

[formula]

From the standard Strichartz estimate [\eqref=KT_result], we have

[formula]

for all Schrödinger admissible pairs (r,q). Thus it is enough to show

[formula]

for all Schrödinger admissible pairs (r,q).

By the duality argument, estimate [\eqref=A=0_reduce_1] is equivalent to

[formula]

Now, we consider the left-hand side of this inequality. Commuting the operator and integration, we have

[formula]

By Hölder's inequality, we have

[formula]

Thanks to [\cite=RV2], for any [formula], we have

[formula]

if [\eqref=Cond_Decay_V] holds. More precisely, by Propositions 2.3 and 4.2 in [\cite=RV2], we have

[formula]

Thus, if [formula], we get

[formula]

and this implies [\eqref=RV2_result], where the constant [formula] plays the role of cn in condition [\eqref=Cond_Decay_V]. As a result, we can reduce [\eqref=A=0_reduce_1] to

[formula]

It now remains to establish ([\ref=CK_goal]). Firstly, from [\cite=RV2] and the duality of Keel-Tao's result [\eqref=KT_result], we know

[formula]

for all Schrödinger admissible pair (r,q). Then [\eqref=CK_reduce] implies

[formula]

by the Christ-Kiselev lemma [\cite=CK] for q > 2. Combining [\eqref=CK_reduce] with [\eqref=CK_reduce_2], we directly get [\eqref=CK_goal] for q > 2. Secondly, for the endpoint case [formula], we have

[formula]

from Hölder's inequality in x with the inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates by Keel-Tao. Observe now that [\eqref=CK_reduce_3] implies [\eqref=CK_goal] when q = 2 with the assumption [formula].

The proof is now complete.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm_2]

We now prove Theorem [\ref=main_thm_2]. Let u1 be a solution of the magnetic Schrödinger equation in [formula]:

[formula]

and let u2 be a solution of the purely electric Schrödinger equation in [formula]:

[formula]

By [\eqref=expend_H], expand H in [\eqref=mS_eq]:

[formula]

then u  =  (u1  +  u2) / 2 is a solution of [\eqref=mS_eq], and

[formula]

According to Theorem [\ref=main_thm_1], if

[formula]

then

[formula]

for all non-endpoint admissible pairs (r,q). For the endpoint case, this estimate also holds since [\eqref=Cond_2'] clearly implies [formula] when [formula].

We first need to consider only [formula] (the case H =  - Δ2A), which can be handled almost in the same way as in [\cite=DFVV]. Denote [formula] and [formula]; then we can expand [\eqref=V=0_eq] as follows:

[formula]

Thus, by Duhamel's principle, we have a formal solution of [\eqref=V=0_eq] given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

From [\cite=RV] and [\cite=IK] (see also (3.4) in [\cite=DFVV]), it follows that for every admissible pair (r,q),

[formula]

where Cj  =  {x:2j  ≤  |x|  ≤  2j + 1}. Then, from [\eqref=Duhamel_sol] and the previous inequalities [\eqref=KT_result] and [\eqref=deri_inho_est], we know

[formula]

For the second term here, we get

[formula]

Next, we will use a known result in [\cite=FV]. For our purpose, it suffices to appeal to the following restricted version of the original.

(Theorem 1.9 and 1.10 in [\cite=FV]). Assume [formula], [formula], and [formula] satisfies conditions [\eqref=Cond_B_n=3] and [\eqref=Cond_B_n>3]. Then, for any solution u of [\eqref=V=0_eq] with f∈L2 and [formula], the following estimate holds:

[formula]

From [\eqref=Cond_2'] with Lemma [\ref=Lamma_FV], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

That is,

[formula]

Firstly, consider the case n = 3. From [\eqref=Cond_2'] with [formula], [\eqref=key_leq_ineq] in Proposition [\ref=Key_Prop] holds for all [formula]. (Here, [formula].) Then by [\eqref=key_geq_ineq] in Proposition [\ref=Key_Prop], we get

[formula]

for all admissible pairs (r,q). (It clearly includes the endpoint case (n,r,q) = (3,6,2).)

Secondly, for the case [formula], we already know that [\eqref=key_leq_ineq] holds for 1 < p < 2n and [\eqref=key_geq_ineq] is valid holds for [formula] under the same conditions on [formula] (see [\cite=DFVV]). Thus we can easily get the same bound as [\eqref=commute_relation] for all admissible pairs (r,q).

Since the operators [formula] and eitH are commutative, we get

[formula]

from [\eqref=commute_relation], and this completes the proof.
