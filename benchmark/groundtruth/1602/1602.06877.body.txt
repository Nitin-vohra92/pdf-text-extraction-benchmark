Anharmonic effects in atomic hydrogen: superconductivity and lattice dynamical stability

Introduction

The recent measurement of a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 203 K in the sulfur hydrogen system[\cite=Drozdov2015], a temperature reachable on Earth's surface, is a major breakthrough in the field of superconductivity. It ultimately validates Ashcroft's idea that hydrogen and hydrogen-dominant metallic compounds can be high-temperature superconductors [\cite=PhysRevLett.21.1748] [\cite=PhysRevLett.92.187002]. This measurement offers new hopes to find sooner than later room-temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen-rich compounds or hydrogen itself. Indeed, since the advent of modern ab initio calculations for the electron-phonon interaction, many theoretical calculations have predicted astonishingly high Tc values for hydrogen at megabar pressures, both in molecular and atomic phases, the largest Tc values predicted for any compound up to date[\cite=cudazzo:257001] [\cite=2007SSCom.141..610Z] [\cite=PhysRevB.81.134505] [\cite=PhysRevB.81.134506] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.144515] [\cite=Yan20111264] [\cite=Maksimov2001569].

Thus far, five solid phases of hydrogen have been determined, all of them molecular and insulating. However, a sixth metallic one has been recently claimed to be found[\cite=Eremets2016]. Phase I is thought to be a molecular solid of quantum rotors on a hexagonal close packed lattice[\cite=Nat.383.702]. It is found in a wide pressure and temperature range up to the melting curve, which has a maximum of ~  1000 K around 65 GPa[\cite=PhysRevLett.100.155701] [\cite=natureliquidh]. Phase II appears between approximately 50-150 GPa and only below 150 K, temperature at which it transforms back to phase I[\cite=RevModPhys.66.671]. Hydrogen adopts phase III above 150 GPa up to at least 360 GPa[\cite=PhysRevLett.108.146402] [\cite=Goncharov04122001]. Recent experiments have determined that this phase transforms to phase IV at around 200 K in the 240-325 GPa pressure range [\cite=Eremets2011] [\cite=PhysRevLett.108.125501] [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.217402], which might melt close to room temperature[\cite=Howie2015]. Transition from phase IV to V occurs at 325 GPa, the last one existing probably up to the dissociation pressure[\cite=Dalladay-Simpson2016]. Finally, a new work claims to have found phase VI by cooling down phase V below 200-220 K. This new phase could be metallic, but further work is expected to confirm this result[\cite=Eremets2016]. In any case, and even though the goal seems closer than ever, the quest for metallic hydrogen continues. Extrapolation of optical experiments[\cite=optical] predicted a metallization pressure of around 450 GPa, which was expected to occur due to the overlap between the valence and conduction bands in the molecular state before molecular dissociation[\cite=pickard:473] [\cite=PhysRevB.85.214114]. However, works in Ref. [\cite=Dalladay-Simpson2016] and [\cite=Eremets2016] suggest metallization might occur together with molecular dissociation. In any case, state-of-the-art static diamond anvil cell techniques[\cite=Dubrovinsky2015] will allow promising future experiments that are expected to shine light on this long standing quest.

According to recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations including anharmonicity for the zero-point energy[\cite=PhysRevLett.112.165501], above 374 GPa hydrogen should undergo a transition to a metallic and atomic tetragonal I41 / amd phase (shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:structure]), which had been predicted before[\cite=PhysRevLett.106.165302]. It seems the inclusion of anharmonicity is important to describe the boundaries of phases I, II, III, and IV[\cite=Drummond2015], as well as to estimate the vibron energies in phases III and IV[\cite=PhysRevB.87.174110] [\cite=PhysRevLett.110.025903]. Nevertheless, even if anharmonicity has a huge impact on the superconducting properties of many hydrides[\cite=PhysRevLett.114.157004] [\cite=errea_inverse_isotope] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302] [\cite=doi:10.1080/08957959.2010.520209] [\cite=PhysRevB.82.104504], the potential impact of anharmonicity in the large Tc values predicted for hydrogen[\cite=cudazzo:257001] [\cite=2007SSCom.141..610Z] [\cite=PhysRevB.81.134505] [\cite=PhysRevB.81.134506] [\cite=PhysRevB.84.144515] [\cite=Yan20111264] [\cite=Maksimov2001569] remains unexplored. Considering that in aluminum[\cite=doi:10.1080/08957959.2010.520209] [\cite=PhysRevB.82.104504], palladium[\cite=errea_inverse_isotope], and platinum hydrides[\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302], as well as in the record superconductor H3S[\cite=PhysRevLett.114.157004] anharmonicity suppresses the electron-phonon couping as it tends to harden optical H-character phonon modes, one might expect that anharmonicity might strongly impact superconductivity in hydrogen too.

In this work we present an ab initio analysis based on density-functional theory (DFT) of electronic and vibrational properties of I41 / amd hydrogen in the 400-600 GPa pressure range. Our goal is to elucidate what the impact of anharmonicity is in the possible first structure of atomic hydrogen. Our results show a close to free-electron-like behavior, as the DFT band structure is perfectly described even if electron-electron interaction is fully neglected. The harmonic phonons calculated within linear-response density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT)[\cite=RevModPhys.73.515] show the system is dynamically stable even if marked Kohn anomalies are present. Despite the minor role of electron-electron interaction in the electronic states, electronic exchange becomes of vital importance to ensure the dynamical stability of the system. We have included anharmonic effects using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA)[\cite=errea_inverse_isotope] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302] and observed the phonon spectrum is significantly modified. However, in contrast to many superconducting hydrides[\cite=PhysRevLett.114.157004] [\cite=errea_inverse_isotope] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302] [\cite=doi:10.1080/08957959.2010.520209] [\cite=PhysRevB.82.104504], the superconducting Tc obtained within the harmonic approximation is barely modified by anharmonicity, it is only suppressed by a 6%.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=theory] we overview the computational details and methods used throughout. In Sec. [\ref=results] we present and analyze the obtained results. Finally, we present a summary of our conclusions in Sec. [\ref=conclusions].

Computational details

We performed our DFT calculations within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized-gradient approximation[\cite=pbe]. The electron-proton interaction was considered making use of an ultrasoft pseudopotential as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO [\cite=0953-8984-21-39-395502]. Due to the large kinetic energy of the electrons, a proper convergence of the electronic properties and phonon frequencies required a dense [formula] k-mesh and 0.05 Ry Hermite-Gaussian electronic smearing for the electronic integrations in the first Brillouin zone (BZ). An energy cutoff of 100 Ry was necessary for expanding the wave-functions in the plane-wave basis.

Phonon frequencies were calculated within DFPT as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO [\cite=0953-8984-21-39-395502] in a [formula] q-point grid in the BZ. Fourier interpolation was used to obtain the phonon spectra along high-symmetry lines. We find convenient to split the calculated dynamical matrices at a given wave-vector as [formula]. Dp represents the contribution of the proton-proton Coulomb interaction to the dynamical matrix, which can be estimated analytically with an Ewald summation. De contains the effect of the electronic response to the proton motion in the dynamical matrix. Besides DFPT, we have also estimated De making use of the free-electron Lindhard response function within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) as in Ref. [\cite=Rousseau2010]. In the latter approach the dynamical matrix is analytical at any [formula] so that we have not restricted the calculations to the [formula] grid.

Electron-phonon martix elements were also calculated within DFPT in a [formula] [formula]-point grid. Converging the double Dirac delta in the equation for the phonon linewidth required a [formula] denser k-point mesh. The superconducting Tc was calculated solving isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations[\cite=sov.phys.jetp.7.996] [\cite=sov.phys.jetp.11.696], considering that for large electron-phonon coupling constants McMillan's equation underestimates Tc[\cite=PhysRevB.12.905].

We use the SSCHA[\cite=errea_inverse_isotope] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302] to calculate the anharmonic renormalization of the phonon spectrum. The SSCHA is a variational method in which the vibrational free energy is minimized with respect to a trial harmonic density matrix. This minimization process requires the calculation of forces acting on atoms in supercells for different configurations created with the trial density matrix. These forces were calculated in a [formula] supercell making use of DFT with the same parameters as the DFPT phonon calculations. This yielded phonon frequencies in a commensurate [formula] [formula]-point grid. The difference between the harmonic and anharmonic dynamical matrices was interpolated to the finer [formula] grid. The anharmonic correction to the superconducting Tc was calculated combining the SSCHA dynamical matrices with the calculated electron-phonon deformation potential within DFPT as explained in Ref. [\cite=errea_inverse_isotope].

Results and discussion

Electronic structure

Hydrogen, containing a single proton and an electron, is supposed to leave its common molecular nature under a sufficient high pressure to form a metal similar to the alkalies. In the high pressure limit the dominant electronic kinetic energy would be responsible for ending up with a free-electron-like metal. However, in the analyzed pressure range we are still close to the dissociation/metallization pressure[\cite=optical] and the problem is not as simple as one could imagine a priori.

Fig. [\ref=fig:bands] shows the electronic band structure of I41 / amd hydrogen at 500 GPa. The bands present a huge dispersion, associated to the dominating kinetic term in the energies of the electronic states. The calculated band structure is not far from the free-electron approximation, the main difference being the band gaps opened at the border of the BZ and whenever band crossing occurs due to the interaction of the electrons with the proton lattice. It is interesting to point out that if we consider the independent electron approximation, just keeping the Ve,p term that gives the electron-proton interaction in the Vscf self-consistent potential and neglecting the VH Hartree and Vxc electron-electron interactions (see for details), the resulting bands match almost perfectly with the DFT ones. Therefore, we can conclude that main differences with the free-electron approximation are due to the large proton-electron interaction, and that the interaction between the electrons is not giving any significant contribution to the band structure. Fig. [\ref=fig:fermisurface] shows the Fermi surface, which is quite spherical. However, the sphere shows some open areas around the high symmetry point N, where it touches the BZ boundary and a band gap is opened.

Vibrational properties

In Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.lindhard] we show the calculated phonon dispersion in tetragonal I41 / amd hydrogen at 500 GPa within DFPT. We also show the phonons at 400 and 600 GPa, but due to the minor qualitative changes we will focus just in the 500 GPa spectrum, as the analysis should be valid for all the pressure range. The system clearly is dynamically stable, but there are some branches with strong Kohn anomalies[\cite=PhysRevLett.90.035501], specially the low energy transverse acoustic branch. Indeed, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.lindhard], q-points at which the anomalies appear coincide with [formula], where kf is the Fermi wave-vector and [formula] the reciprocal lattice vector that brings [formula] back into the BZ. Considering the validity of the free-electron-like approximation to describe the electronic band structure, we have calculated the phonon dispersion within this approximation, assuming that the De contribution to the dynamical matrix can be calculated with the Lindhard response function at the RPA level as in Ref. [\cite=Rousseau2010], therefore, neglecting correlation and exchange in the electronic response. In this free-electron limit we can obtain the spectra along high-symmetry lines without any Fourier interpolation, evidencing the presence of the Kohn anomalies at the [formula] points, and confirming that the kinks present in the DFPT result are Kohn anomalies.

Nevertheless, the Lindhard RPA spectrum completely differs from the ab initio calculations. The intensity of the Kohn anomalies is much stronger and the transverse acoustic modes become unstable with imaginary frequencies. Therefore, even though the electronic band structure could be understood within the free-electron-like approximation, phonons seem to be far from this picture, contrary to the case of sodium[\cite=Rousseau2010] [\cite=springerlink:10.1140/epjb/e2011-10972-9]. This fact also questions the stability of the I41 / amd tetragonal phase in the ultimate high-pressure limit where the electrons are expected to be free. If we split the dynamical matrix in the Dp and De terms, we note that each of them scales differently with the average inter-electronic distance parameter rs: Dp always scales as r- 3s, while, in the Lindhard RPA, De scales as r- 2s(rs + C), where C is always positive and of the order of unity. Therefore, in the very large pressure limit with small rs, the Dp contribution is expected to dominate over the electronic contribution. In Fig. [\ref=fig:contributions] we present the dispersion of the root of the eigenvalues of each contribution separately. This represents the phonon spectra that would be obtained from each contribution independently. In our case, phonons associated to Dp are already unstable and the contribution from De is not enough to stabilize them. This is the reason why the Lindhard RPA phonons have imaginary frequencies. As in the high-pressure limit Dp will dominate over De, the tetragonal I41 / amd will not become stable at very large pressure, but more symmetric and compact structures with positive eigenvalues of Dp (as fcc or bcc) will be favored.

In order to better understand the discrepancy between the ab initio DFPT and the Lindhard RPA spectra, we have made several calculations based on linear-response theory trying to disentangle the different contributions to the final phonon spectra. The calculation of De requires not only the knowledge of the electronic density n but also its linear change δn with respect to ionic displacementsi [\cite=RevModPhys.73.515]. This last term can be calculated from the interacting electronic density-response function χ, which requires first the knowledge of the non-interacting response χ0, and second to solve an integral Dyson-like equation where the linear change of the self-consistent potential δVscf takes part (see ). Although it requires a cumbersome sum over excited state, χ0 can be calculated directly from the eigenvalues and eigenstates obtained with the unperturbed Vscf self-consistent potential. Combining different approximations in Vscf to calculate χ0 and δVscf to calculate χ, the relevant contributions to the dynamical matrices can be unveiled. For instance, in the Lindhard RPA limit χ0 is built from free-electron bands (Vscf = 0) and exchange-correlation is neglected to build χ (δVscf  =  δVe,p  +  δVH), limit in which De is reduced to a simple analytical expression [\cite=Rousseau2010]. Here, we avoid the explicit calculation of χ0 and χ by calculating δn making use of DFPT. In this case, the Sternheimer equation is solved self-consistently neglecting different terms in Vscf and δVscf, which is equivalent to making different approaches to χ0 and χ respectively. In those cases when a different scheme is adopted for Vscf and δVscf translational invariance is not satisfied anymore. We overcome this difficulty imposing the acoustic sum rule (ASR) a posteriori (see for technical details).

In Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.all] we show three phonon spectra with different combination of neglected terms in Vscf and δVscf. First, we show the spectrum obtained by neglecting any electron-electron interaction in the unperturbed Hamiltonian (Vscf = Ve,p), but keeping all the terms in its linear perturbation δVscf  =  δVe,p  +  δVH  +  δVxc. We obtain exactly the same result as in the previously calculated full DFPT phonons (see Fig. [\ref=spectraappendix2] in for a comparison), remarking the insignificant role of electron-electron interaction in the electronic bands and, consequently, in χ0. Second, we show the phonons calculated neglecting electron-electron interaction in Vscf again, but this time neglecting the exchange and correlation term in δVscf. This is equivalent to calculating χ0 as in the previous case, but calculating χ within the RPA. We can see that electronic exchange and correlation is crucial to properly account for the electronic response in this system as the RPA fails dramatically predicting that the system is dynamically unstable. Finally, we show the dispersion obtained with free electrons (Vscf = 0) but using the full linear perturbation going beyond the RPA. Comparing the free-electron RPA calculation in Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.lindhard] with the one including exchange-correlation effects for the response in Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.all], it can be confirmed again that including exchange and correlation in δVscf (and therefore in χ) is determinant for obtaining dynamically stable phonons. However, due to the strong electron-proton interaction, including Ve,p in the self-consistent potential is necessary to obtain good quantitative results.

Analyzing these different calculations, we conclude that, despite the electronic kinetic energy dominates and the electron-electron interaction plays a negligible role in the band structure, going beyond the RPA including exchange-correlation effects in the calculation of the electronic response is crucial. Indeed, exchange-correlation effects in the response to the proton motion make tetragonal I41 / amd atomic hydrogen dynamically stable. This calamitous failure of the RPA is related to the high electronic density around the protons, which is underestimated by the Hartree term by up to a 9%. We have checked that similar phonons are obtained for different approximations of the exchange-correlation potential[\cite=PhysRevB.37.785] [\cite=ldalinear]. This is not the case in the molecular case at lower pressures, where correlation clearly has an effect in the energies of molecular vibrons[\cite=PhysRevB.88.014115].

Even if exchange-correlation effects guarantee the stability of the tetragonal I41 / amd atomic structure of hydrogen, this conclusion is drawn exclusively at the harmonic level. In Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.anharmonic] we compare the harmonic DFPT phonon spectra with the anharmonic spectra obtained within the SSCHA. Anharmonicity is quite strong, as phonon frequencies are affected up to a 20% in the transverse acoustic branch in the Γ-N path. Transverse acoustic branches are in general specially vulnerable as their energies are considerably lowered. Consequently, one could expect anharmonic effects to increase the zero-point displacement of the atoms, bringing atomic hydrogen closer to quantum melting. According to our calculations, however, I41 / amd hydrogen is not melted if we hold to the quantum limit of the Lindemman criterion, which states quantum melting occurs when the Root Mean Square (RMS) displacements of atoms are around 27 - 30% of the interatomic distances [\cite=PhysRevB.55.5767]. While in the harmonic approach we obtain RMS displacements of a 20.3% and a 16.4% relative to the two different interatomic distances d1 and d2 of the crystal, these values are only slightly raised by anharmonicity to a 20.7% and a 16.6%, respectively. The reason of this rather small change is a big part of the high energy modes are enhanced by anharmonicity, compensating the softening of the transverse acoustic branches.

As most of the phases have been found and characterized by Raman and infrared spectroscopy experiments, we show the impact of anharmonicity in the optical modes at the Γ point in Table [\ref=table:ramanir]. The structure has two Raman active modes that are barely affected by anharmonicity.

Superconductivity

In order to analyze how anharmonicity affects superconductivity, we have calculated Eliashberg's function α2F(ω) at 500 GPa both in the harmonic and anharmonic cases as described in Sec. [\ref=theory]. The α2F(ω) shows a large peak at high energy due to the large electron-phonon linewidth of high-energy optical modes (see Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.anharmonic]). The practically linear and homogeneous increase of the integrated electron-phonon coupling constant [formula] indicates that the contribution to the electron-phonon coupling constant is quite homogeneous over all the modes in the BZ. This is true both in the harmonic and in the anharmonic case. Even if anharmonic effects have a significant impact on the phonon spectra, the electron-phonon coupling constant λ  =  λ(  ∞  ), which scales with the phonon frequencies as [formula], is practically unaltered by anharmonicity, as we obtain λ = 1.68 and λ = 1.63 in the harmonic and anharmonic cases, respectively. The contribution of the low-energy transverse acoustic modes to the electron-phonon coupling constant is slightly enhanced due to the anharmonic suppression of their frequencies. This is compensated by the hardening of the high-energy optical modes that suppresses λ. The result is that anharmonicity slightly affects the electron-phonon coupling constant.

We estimate the superconducting critical temperature by solving isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations in order to overcome the underestimation of Tc given by McMillan's equation in the strongly interacting limit[\cite=PhysRevB.12.905]. With a Coulomb pseudopotential of μ* = 0.1 we obtain a superconducting energy gap (first Matsubara frequency) of [formula] meV and [formula] meV, respectively, in the harmonic and anharmonic cases at 0 K (see Fig. [\ref=fig:supergap]). Tc, defined as the temperature at which the gap vanishes, is 318 K and 300 K respectively in the harmonic and anharmonic approaches. The harmonic result is in reasonable agreement with previous results[\cite=PhysRevB.84.144515]. The effect of the Coulomb pseudopotential in Tc is weak as it happens in strongly interacting electron-phonon superconductors. Therefore, anharmonicity slightly lowers the superconducting critical temperature in tetragonal I41 / amd hydrogen due to the small reduction of λ. In Fig. [\ref=fig:supergap] we also show the first Matsubara frequencies of the energy gap at 400 GPa and 600 GPa in the harmonic approach. As wee can see, Tc is very weakly affected by pressure in the 400-600 GPa pressure range. Due to the flatness of Tc and the smooth change of the phonons with pressure (Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.lindhard]) anharmonic effects are expected to have a similar impact at the 400 and 600 GPa.

Considering that in all superconducting hydrides where strong anharmonic effects in superconductivity have been reported there are strongly softened optical modes in the harmonic approximation[\cite=PhysRevLett.114.157004] [\cite=errea_inverse_isotope] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302] [\cite=doi:10.1080/08957959.2010.520209] [\cite=PhysRevB.82.104504], even imaginary sometimes, it seems the impact of anharmonicity on Tc is largely determined by the presence of such soft hydrogen-character optical modes. Due to the fairly uniform distribution of the electron-phonon coupling in the BZ here, there are no particular optical modes that soften, making anharmonic effects on Tc weaker.

Conclusions

In this work we have presented an exhaustive analysis of the electronic and vibrational properties of I41 / amd hydrogen within the 400-600 GPa pressure range. Atomic metallic hydrogen in this phase shows a close to free-electron-like electronic band structure, where the opened band gaps can be explained even without the need of electron-electron interaction. The huge kinetic energy of the electrons due to the extremely high pressure plus their strong interaction with the bare nuclei makes the electron-electron interaction be irrelevant for the electronic structure. Nevertheless, the strong electron-proton interaction creates a big electronic localization near the atomic nuclei. Consequently, the RPA dramatically fails when calculating the phonons of atomic hydrogen. In fact, the inclusion of exchange-correlation effects in the calculation of the electronic response to proton motion guarantees the dynamical stability of the structure.

Despite anharmonicity modifies phonon frequencies up to approximately a 20%, for instance, lowering the energies of the transverse acoustic modes and hardening high-energy optical modes, it has a minor effect on superconductivity, only suppressing Tc by a 6%. This is in stark contrast to other hydrides where anharmonicity has a huge impact on the superconducting properties[\cite=PhysRevLett.114.157004] [\cite=errea_inverse_isotope] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.064302] [\cite=doi:10.1080/08957959.2010.520209] [\cite=PhysRevB.82.104504], even inducing an inverse isotope effect in palladium hydrides[\cite=errea_inverse_isotope]. This raises the interesting question whether anharmoncicity impacts superconductivity in hydrides simply because hydrogen is light and vibrates far from equilibrium or for another particular reason. Our results suggest that determining whether anharmonicity has a strong impact on Tc cannot be related exclusively to the lightness of the ions present in the system, but to the presence of softened optical modes.

Appendix

Within DFT the electronic wave-functions [formula] are calculated diagonalizing the

[formula]

Hamiltonian as [formula], where εi is the electronic eigenvalue, Te is the electronic kinetic energy, and the self-consistent potential is

[formula]

Ve,p, VH, and Vxc are, respectively, the electron-proton, Hartree, and exchange-correlation potentials. The different band structures shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:bands] are obtained neglecting different terms in Eq. [\eqref=hamiltonian]. The DFT result, of course, retains all the terms in Vscf; in the free-electron approximation Vscf  =  0; and in the independent electron approximation Vscf  =  Ve,p. We call the latter approach independent electron because in this case electrons do not interact with each other via the VH and Vxc potentials, which depend on the electronic density n.

The electronic part of the dynamical matrix De is obtained Fourier transforming the electronic contribution to the force constant matrix, which is given in terms of the electronic density and its derivatives by

[formula]

Here, [formula] is a lattice vector and [formula] is the displacement in the Cartesian direction α of atom i in the unit cell belonging to the cell defined by [formula]. The calculation of De requires thus the knowledge of the δn the linear change of the electronic density with respect to to the ionic displacements. Making use of the electronic density-response function [formula] the linear change of the density can be calculated as

[formula]

where [formula] represents the linear change of the electron-proton potential. The density response function is usually calculated by first estimating the noninteracting response function [formula], which can be directly calculated from the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian in Eq. [\eqref=hamiltonian] as

[formula]

where fi represents the Fermi-Dirac occupation of the i-th state. The reason for it is that the linear change of density can be given as

[formula]

in terms of the noninteracting response function and the linear change of the self-consistent potential. Combining Eqs. [\eqref=dn-chi] and [\eqref=dn-chi0], with the linear change of the potential the following self-consistent Dyson-like equation can be obtained for the response function:

[formula]

with

[formula]

and Exc the exchange-correlation energy. If [formula] is neglected in Eq. [\eqref=dn-chi0], [formula]. This is the RPA approximation. Neglecting different contributions for Vscf in Eq. [\eqref=vscf] one can understand which are the important contributions to the non-interacting [formula]. Similarly, neglecting different terms in δVscf in Eq. [\eqref=dn-chi0] the important contributions to [formula] can be determined.

DFPT [\cite=RevModPhys.73.515] offers a much more efficient method to calculate δn avoiding the cumbersome calculation of the response function, which requires a slowly converging sum over excited states as shown in Eq. [\eqref=chi0-real-space]. Within DFPT the Sternheimer equation

[formula]

is solved self-consistently. Here, δεi and [formula] are, respectively, the linear change of the electronic eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Once the Sternheimer equation is solved and the [formula] states are known, δn can be calculated and, consequently, De [\cite=RevModPhys.73.515]. By neglecting in Eq. [\eqref=sternheimer] different terms in Vscf and δVscf we are able to make different implicit approaches to χ0 and χ, respectively, as described in the previous paragraph.

It is important to note that every time the approaches for Vscf and δVscf are different (i.e. the neglected terms are not the same) translational invariance is broken down. The reason is that the ground state densities given by the different approximations differ. In those cases, we impose the ASR a posteriori by correcting the force-constants matrix in Eq. [\eqref=second-derivatives-2] as

[formula]

for every possible i, α and β. The new φ̃ yield dynamical matrices that satisfy the ASR. This way of imposing the ASR is equivalent to correcting the second addend in Eq. [\eqref=second-derivatives-2] a posteriori, which gives a non-dispersive term to the dynamical matrix as the correction in Eq. [\eqref=second-derivatives-3]. As an example, in Fig. [\ref=spectraappendix1] we show how imposing of the ASR works in the case Vscf = 0, ~ δVscf  =  δVe,p  +  δVH, which is equivalent to the analytic Lindhard RPA approximation. We see how after imposing the ASR the spectrum coincides with the analytic one. The small differences between the analytic spectrum and the one obtained with the DFPT procedure are because the latter is obtained from a Fourier interpolation from a [formula] q-grid, while the former is calculated point by point.

The phonon-spectra presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:phonons.all] are calculated solving Eq. [\eqref=sternheimer] in three different ways: i) taking Vscf = Ve,p and δVscf  =  δVe,p  +  δVH  +  δVxc; ii) taking Vscf = Ve,p but neglecting the linear change of the exchange correlation so that δVscf  =  δVe,p  +  δVH; iii) neglecting any interaction of electrons in the self-consistent potential (Vscf = 0) but taking the full linear change of it (δVscf  =  δVe,p  +  δVH  +  δVxc). In Fig. [\ref=spectraappendix2] we show how the inclusion of the electron-electron interaction in Vscf is irrelevant, as one obtains the same spectra as including it (after imposing ASR in the first case).
