Rational Density on Compact Real Manifolds

Introduction

Let M be a Ck-smooth compact manifold without boundary. We say that Ck(M), the space of k-times continuously differentiable [formula]-valued functions on M, has n-rational density if there is a tuple F = (f1,...,fn) of n functions in Ck(M) such that the set is Ck-dense in Ck(M). If F exists, we call {f1,...,fn} an RD-basis of Ck(M). It is a simple consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem that the space of continuous functions on a circle is 1-rationally dense. This paper is motivated by the following two-dimensional analogue of this fact, proved in [\cite=ShSu15]:

The space of continuous functions on every smooth compact surface, with the exception of the 2-sphere and the projective plane, is 2-rationally dense.

We ask whether a similar statement can be made for compact manifolds of higher dimensions. To this end, we obtain the following result.

Let M be a compact C∞-smooth manifold of dimension m. Then, for any l  ≥  0, Cl(M) has n-rational density for [formula].

In Section [\ref=sec_ex], we show that the above result is optimal -- in the sense that for every m, there exists an m-dimensional manifold M for which Cl(M) does not have [formula]-rational density for any l > 0. However, for particular m-dimensional manifolds, this bound can be improved. For instance, [formula], where [formula] is the m-dimensional torus (S1)×  m, always has m-rational density (with { exp (iθ1),..., exp (iθm)} as an RD-basis). More generally, for m-manifolds with trivializable complexified tangent bundle, we can always achieve (m + 1)-rational density (see Proposition [\ref=prop_par]).

The notion of rational density is intimately related to that of rational convexity. A subset [formula] is called rationally convex if for every [formula], there is an algebraic hypersurface that passes through z and completely avoids X. Indeed, if {f1,...,fn} is an RD-basis of C0(M), then F = (f1,...,fn) maps M onto a rationally convex set in [formula]. On the other hand, if [formula] maps onto a rationally convex set, then, due to an Oka-Weil-type result, functions in O(M) can be Ck-approximated by rational functions on M. If, furthermore, F is totally real, i.e., [formula] for all p∈M, then O(M) is dense in Ck(M). Thus, Theorem [\ref=thm_optbd] reduces to the task of finding bounds on n (depending on m =  dim M) such that M admits totally real rationally convex embeddings into [formula]. The existence of totally real immersions and embeddings has been studied extensively (see [\cite=Fo86] and [\cite=HoJaLa12], for instance). The added condition of rational convexity -- which is, in general, hard to establish -- gives this problem a symplectic flavour. This is due to a result by Duval and Sibony in [\cite=DuSi95] which states that any totally real C∞-smooth submanifold [formula] is rationally convex if and only if it is isotropic in [formula] for some Kähler form ω -- i.e., j*ω  =  0 on X, where [formula] is the inclusion map. So, if M admits isotropic embeddings into [formula], where [formula] is the standard symplectic form on [formula], then Ck(M) has n-rational density. It turns out that this is essentially a complete characterization, and we have the following result, which is a major ingredient of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_optbd].

Let M be a Ck-smooth (k  ≥  1) compact manifold of dimension m. Then,

For n > m, Ck(M) has n-rational density if and only if M embeds as an isotropic C∞-submanifold in [formula] via a Ck-embedding.

For n = m, Ck(M) has n-rational density if M embeds as a Lagrangian C∞-submanifold in [formula] via a Ck-embedding. The n-rational density of Ck(M), on the other hand, implies the existence of a Lagrangian Ck - 1-embedding of M into [formula] when k  ≥  2.

It is clear from our proof of Theorem  [\ref=thm_isotemb] that if M admits a Ck-smooth isotropic embedding in [formula], then every Cl(M), 0  ≤  l  ≤  k, has n-rational density.

A matter of some delicacy is the rational density of C0(M). If C0(M) has n-rational density, any RD-basis of C0(M) gives a topological embedding of M into [formula] that may, a priori, have no distinctive symplectic property in [formula]. However, the connection of rational convexity to symplectic geometry may still be of use as seen in [\cite=ShSu15], where any compact surface (other than S2 and [formula]) is topologically embedded as a singular Lagrangian surface in [formula] with special singularities that render the embedded surface rationally convex. As mentioned in Section  [\ref=sec_ex], this approach is yet to be tested in higher dimensions.

A natural analogue to the notion of rational density is that of polynomial density. For a Ck-smooth M, we say that Ck(M) has n-polynomial density if there is a tuple F = (f1,...,fn) of n functions in Ck(M) such that the set is Ck-dense in Ck(M). If such an F exists, we call {f1,...,fn} a PD-basis of Ck(M). It is clear that n-polynomial density implies n-rational density. The converse is, however, not true. To see this, we observe that any PD-basis {f1,...,fn} of C0(M) gives rise to a topological embedding F = (f1,...,fn) of M into [formula]. Moreover, any continuous function on F(M) can be uniformly approximated on it by polynomials. This forces F(M) to be polynomially convex. A set [formula] is called polynomially convex if it coincides with By topological reasons, any embedding of [formula] in [formula] cannot be polynomially convex. Hence, [formula] has n-rational density, but not n-polynomial density. Since rationally convex subsets of [formula] can be realized as polynomially convex subsets of [formula], it turns out that [formula] does have (n + 1)-polynomial density, and more generally, we have

Let M be a Ck-smooth (k  ≥  1) compact m-manifold. Then, Ck(M) has (n + 1)-polynomial density if M embeds as a C∞-smooth isotropic embedding in [formula] via a Ck-embedding. In particular, for any compact C∞-smooth m-manifold M and l  ≥  0, Cl(M) has n-polynomial density for [formula].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we collect some technical lemmas. We present the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] in Section [\ref=sec_pfthm2]. The remaining results are either corollaries of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb], or are proved using similar techniques, and their proofs are given in Section [\ref=sec_remthm]. In the final section, we summarize the extent of what is known for manifolds of low dimensions, establish the optimality of the bound in Theorem [\ref=thm_optbd], and pose some open questions.

Preliminaries

We will use the following notation in this paper:

[formula] denotes the floor function of [formula].

O(X) is the space of functions that are holomorphic in some open neighbourhood of [formula].

B(z;r) denotes the n-ball of radius r > 0 centred at [formula].

[formula], at any [formula].

When talking about Ck-smooth functions on a Ck-smooth manifold M, we keep the following in mind.

Let U: = {Uβ,φβ}β∈B be a finite atlas on M. The Ck-norm on M (with respect to U) is defined as Different choices of U lead to different, but equivalent, norms on Ck(M). The definition of n-rational density is, therefore, independent of the choice of U. It follows that if F:M  →  M' is a Ck-smooth diffeomorphism, then the Ck-convergence of a sequence [formula] to some h∈Ck(M') is equivalent to the Ck-convergence of [formula] to [formula].

To prove our main results, we isolate a link between the totally real embeddability and the isotropic embeddability of any m-dimensional manifold M into [formula]. When m = n, the Gromov-Lees theorem (see [\cite=AuLaPo94]) states that M admits a Lagrangian immersion into [formula] precisely when its complexified tangent bundle is trivializable. This is the same topological condition that completely characterizes the totally real immersability of M in [formula] (see [\cite=Fo11]). It is, therefore, not surprising that when m < n, the obstruction to the existence of totally real embeddings and to that of isotropic embeddings is one and the same. Although there is some indication of this in the literature, due to the lack of a clear reference, we provide a complete statement and proof of this fact.

Let M be a Ck-smooth (k  ≥  1) compact manifold of real dimension m, and m < n. Then, M admits a Ck-smooth totally real embedding in [formula] if and only if M embeds in [formula] as a C∞-smooth isotropic submanifold via a Ck-embedding.

The main tool in this proof will be the h-principle for contact isotropic immersions. For this purpose, we first transfer the problem to the C∞-smooth category. Let [formula] be a Ck-smooth totally real embedding of M into [formula]. Then, by standard approximation results, there exists a Ck-diffeomorphism [formula] so that φ(τ(M)) is a C∞-smooth (embedded) submanifold of [formula] and φ is Ck-close to the identity. Due to the latter property, φ can be chosen so that φ(τ(M)) continues to be a totally real submanifold of [formula]. This is because the condition of being totally real is an open one. We relabel M to denote φ(τ(M)) and note that M is now a C∞-smooth totally real submanifold of [formula].

Now, consider the contact manifold [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] denote the corresponding contact structure -- i.e., the codimension one sub-bundle of the tangent bundle [formula] that has fibre [formula] at each [formula]. We observe that if [formula] denotes the projection map, then

[formula]

Also, for each [formula], there is an [formula]-isomorphism [formula] given by

[formula]

where {ex1,ey1,...,exn,eyn} is the standard basis of [formula], and yj(p) denotes the yj-th coordinate of p. As λp is smooth in p, it gives a (real) bundle morphism [formula] covering the inclusion map [formula] given by z  ↦  (z,0). Moreover,

[formula]

We will use [\eqref=eq_symcon] and [\eqref=eq_consym] to move between [formula] and [formula].

Recall that an immersion [formula] is called contact isotropic if [formula]. Moreover, From [\eqref=eq_symcon], we have that Thus, [formula] is a symplectic isotropic immersion. In general, [formula] need not be an immersion if f is merely an immersion, but here we have the additional fact that [formula] for every p∈N, since [formula] and [formula]. To summarize,

() every contact isotropic immersed manifold in [formula] projects to a symplectic isotropic immersed manifold in [formula].

Now, suppose we have a sequence of maps where j is the inclusion map defined above. A contact isotropic monomorpism covering [formula] is a monomorphism [formula] covering [formula] such that [formula]. On the other hand, a symplectic isotropic monomorphism [formula] covering g is one that satisfies [formula]. Combining this with [\eqref=eq_consym], we have that Hence, we have that

() every symplectic isotropic monomorphism [formula] covering g lifts to a contact isotropic monomorphism [formula] covering [formula].

Let us now state the relevant h-principle. Let [formula] be the space of contact isotropic immersions of M into [formula], and [formula] be the space of contact isotropic monomorphisms [formula]. Note that any element [formula] can be identified with [formula]. Thus, there is an inclusion map

[formula]

The h-principle in this context states that the inclusion [\eqref=eq:hprin] is, in fact, a homotopy equivalence (see [\cite=CeEl12]). So, M admits a contact isotropic immersion into [formula] if [formula] is nonempty. Due to the observation [\eqref=eq_proj], the nonemptiness of [formula] would imply that M admits a smooth symplectic isotropic immersion into [formula].

We now produce an element in [formula]. Let [formula] denote the inclusion map. Then, [formula] is a totally real monomorphism covering ι. We complexify this map to obtain a complex-linear monomorphism [formula] in the following way: Now, for any complex m-frame [formula], we obtain an injective [formula]-linear map [formula]. Thus, dι lifts to a map on the frame bundle associated to [formula]: where Vn,m is the Stiefel manifold of all complex m-frames in [formula]. By the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process, Vn,m is the product of Un,m -- the space of unitary m-frames in [formula], and P -- the space of upper-triangular matrices with positive eigenvalues. As P is contractible, there is a smooth homotopy [formula] such that H(  ·  ,0) = ιF(  ·  ), H(  ·  ,1) maps [formula] into [formula] and H(  ·  ,t) covers ι for all t∈[0,1]. This homotopy descends to TM to give monomorphisms [formula] covering ι, such that F0 = dι. Moreover, since the real linear span of a unitary m-frame in [formula] is an m-dimensional isotropic subspace (with respect to [formula]), F1 is a symplectic isotropic monomorphism. By [\eqref=eq_lift], [formula]. Thus, there is a smooth immersion [formula] so that f(M) is symplectic isotropic in [formula]. Since dim M < n, a general position lemma allows us to approximate f by an isotropic embedding g (see [\cite=AuLaPo94]). Recall that M is actually φ(τ(M)), where φ and τ are both Ck-smooth. The embedding we seek is [formula], which is clearly Ck-smooth. We have proved one direction of our claim.

Any isotropic linear subspace of [formula] is necessarily a totally real one. So, the converse statement poses no challenge, and the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem_tr-iso] is complete.

It is likely that the contactification procedure can be avoided in the above proof. One approach would be to directly invoke an h-principle for symplectic isotropic immersions. Such an h-principle is alluded to in [\cite=ElMi02], but an actual statement is missing. Alternatively, we could invoke the h-principle for subcritical embeddings stated in [\cite=ElMi02], but it is missing the case n = m + 1 (the required hypothesis is [formula]). We attribute this to an oversight, as the proof given therein seems to work also for [formula] in the symplectic scenario.

Since we heavily rely on [\cite=DuSi95], but do not always have C∞-smoothness at our disposal, we collect some Ck versions of facts that are implicitly or explicitly proved in [\cite=DuSi95].

Let S be a Ck-smooth, k  ≥  1, totally real compact submanifold of [formula] that is rationally convex. Then, we have the following.

For any open neighbourhood U of S, there is an open neighbourhood [formula] of S such that [formula] is rationally convex.

There is a Ck + 1-smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function φ on [formula] such that

φ(z) = C|z|2, for some C > 0, outside a ball containing S;

ι*(ddcφ) = 0 where [formula] is the inclusion map -- i.e., S is isotropic with respect to ddcφ.

Let S and U be as given in (i). Since S is totally real, we can rely on Theorem 6.1.6 in [\cite=St07], to obtain (after shrinking U, if need be) a non-negative strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Next, we fix a neighbourhood [formula] of S, and choose χ to be a smooth cut-off function such that

[formula]

We also fix a closed origin-centred ball [formula] containing U. Our goal is to invoke the following consequence of Theorem 2.1 in [\cite=DuSi95]: Let S be a rationally convex compact set in [formula]. For every x∉S, there is a smooth positive closed (1,1)-form that is strictly positive at x and vanishes in a neighbourhood of S.

In a remark following the above theorem, Duval and Sibony show that, in fact, one can construct a smooth closed (1,1)-form which is strictly positive on [formula], vanishes on S and has a global potential that is C'|z|2, for some C' > 0, outside a ball containing S. In view of this, we let ωB be a closed (1,1)-form that vanishes on B, is strictly positive outside B and has a global potential that is C'|z|2 outside a larger ball B'. For any [formula], we can find a smooth positive closed (1,1)-form ωz that vanishes in some neighbourhood Wz of S, is positive in some neighbourhood Nz of z and and has a global potential that is C'|z|2 outside B'. We cover the compact set [formula] by finitely many such neighbourhoods Nz1,...,Nzk, and set Note that W is a neighbourhood of S contained in V. Now, for sufficiently large constants cj > 0, is a Kähler form on [formula] with [formula], and potential C|z|2 outside B', for some C > 0.

Now, for (i), we can employ the following result of Nemirovski (see [\cite=Ne08]): Let φ be a strictly plurisubharmonic function on an open subset [formula] such that its Levi form ddcφ extends to a positive d-closed (1,1)-form on [formula]. If the set Kφ  =  {z∈U|φ(z)  ≤  0} is compact, then it is rationally convex. We can choose c > 0 small enough so that [formula]. Then, [formula] is the required extension of ddc(ρ - c), and Sc is the required neighbourhood of S.

For (ii), we observe that a global potential of [formula] is of the form φ = Cψ  +  χρ, where ψ(z) = |z|2 outside B'. Also, φ is as smooth as ρ, i.e., Ck + 1-smooth, and since the gradient of ρ vanishes on S.

Our final lemma for this section allows us to state our main results in terms of the standard Kähler form on [formula]. This is essentially Moser's trick.

Assume k  ≥  2. Let φ be a Ck + 1-smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function on [formula] that coincides with C|z|2 outside some ball B(0;R), where C,R > 0 are constants. If an m-manifold M admits a Ck-smooth Lagrangian embedding into [formula], then it admits a Ck - 1-smooth Lagrangian embedding into [formula].

Let φt = tC|z|2 + (1 - t)φ. Then, ωt: = ddcφt = ddcφ + dβt, where βt = dc(tφ1 - tφ). Note that [formula] outside B(0;R). Consider the Ck - 1-smooth (in z) compactly supported vector field Xt defined by where ιXω denotes the interior product. Xt is unique since each ωt is non-degenerate (each φt is strictly plurisubharmonic). As Xt is compactly supported, its flow Φt exists. Moreover,

[formula]

Thus, [formula] is a Ck - 1-diffeomorphism such that [formula]. Now, let [formula] be a Ck-smooth Lagrangian embedding with respect to ddcφ. Then, [formula] on M. Thus, [formula] is the required embedding.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb]

Let us first assume that that M admits a Ck-embedding [formula] so that M': = F(M) is an isotropic C∞-submanifold of [formula], where n  ≥  m. Then, owing to [\cite=DuSi95], M' is rationally convex.

Next, we fix an f∈Ck(M') and choose an arbitrary ε > 0. Let [formula], where C is a constant to be determined later. Since M' is totally real, a result due to Range and Siu (see Theorem 1 in [\cite=RaSi74]) grants the existence of a neighbourhood U of M' and a g∈O(U) such that

[formula]

By Lemma  [\ref=lem_ratnbd], we can find a neighbourhood [formula] of M', such that [formula] is rationally convex. By the Oka-Weil-type approximation theorem for rationally convex sets (stated in [\cite=St07]), there is a rational function [formula], with no poles on [formula], such that

[formula]

Now, fix an x∈M'. Since M' is compact, there is an r > 0 -- independent of x∈M' -- such that B(x;r)  ⊂  V. As g - R∈O(B(x,r)), we can combine Cauchy estimates and [\eqref=eq_h-r_sup] to obtain

[formula]

for any [formula]. So, we obtain from [\eqref=eq_c-h] and [\eqref=eq_h-r_ck] that

[formula]

Now, setting [formula], we obtain that Since ε > 0 and f∈Ck(M') were chosen arbitrarily, and C is independent of ε, we conclude that rational functions are dense in the space of Ck-smooth functions on M' in the Ck-norm. In view of Remark  [\ref=rmk_norm], the set is dense in Ck(M). Hence, the n components of F form an RD-basis of Ck(M).

We now turn to the converse statement. Let M be a Ck-smooth manifold such that Ck(M) has n-rational density, and {f1,...,fn} be an RD-basis of Ck(M). We claim that [formula] given by F = (f1,...,fn) is a Ck-smooth totally real embedding of M into [formula].

Suppose F is not injective -- i.e., there are two distinct points p1,p2∈M such that fj(p1) = fj(p2) for all j = 1,...,n. Then, for any function [formula], [formula]. Now, by the n-rational density of Ck(M), any g in Ck(M) can be uniformly approximated on M by functions of the form [formula], where R is a rational function on [formula] with no poles on F(M). Hence, g(p1) = g(p2) for any g∈Ck(M). But this is a contradiction as Ck(M) separates points.

Next, we show that F is a local embedding at every point in M. For this, we fix a p∈M, and choose a coordinate chart [formula] around p, with φ(p) = 0. If φ = (x1,...,xm), we write, in local coordinates, Suppose [formula]. Then, up to relabelling, there exist [formula]-valued constants α1,...,αm - 1 such that Therefore, if R is a holomorphic map in some neighbourhood of F(U), then

[formula]

It follows that every function g in the set (and therefore, in the Ck-closure of the set) has the property that But, by our assumption, the Ck-closure of RF(M) is Ck(M), and one can easily construct a Ck-smooth function g on M such that [formula] for j = 1,...,m - 1, but [formula]. Thus, [formula] for every p∈M, and [formula] is a Ck-smooth embedding.

It now remains to show that F(M) is a totally real submanifold of [formula]. This is done using the same technique as in the preceding paragraphs. Suppose p∈M is such that [formula]. Then, we can choose local coordinates x1,...,xm around p such that This property is inherited by any function of the form [formula], where R∈O(F(M)), and, therefore, by any function that can be expressed as a C1-limit of functions of this form. Hence, by our hypothesis on M, any Ck-smooth function g on M satisfies This is a contradiction as one can construct Ck-smooth functions on M with any prescribed 1-jet at p. Thus, F(M) is a totally real submanifold of [formula]. If n > m, we directly invoke Lemma [\ref=lem_tr-iso] to conclude that there is a Ck-embedding [formula] so that G(M) is an isotropic C∞-submanifold of [formula].

For the case n = m, we need to establish one more thing: F(M) is rationally convex. Recall that any continuous function on F(M) can be uniformly approximated by Ck-functions on F(M). But, R(F(M)) -- the space of rational functions on [formula] with no poles on F(M) -- is dense in Ck(F(M)) since the components of F form an RD-basis of Ck(M). Thus, the uniform closure of R(F(M)) is C0(F(M)). This is a sufficient condition for rational convexity. So, F(M) is a totally real and rationally convex Ck-submanifold of [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem_ratnbd], F(M) is Lagrangian with respect to some Kähler form ddcφ, where φ is a Ck + 1-smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function on [formula] that coincides with C|z|2 outside a ball containing F(M), for some C > 0. By Lemma [\ref=lem_moser], M admits a Ck - 1-smooth Lagrangian embedding into [formula]. This completes the case n = m, and indeed the entire proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb].

For the subcritical case, our proof can be used to improve one direction of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] as: Ck(M) has n-rational density if M admits an isotropic Ck-embedding into [formula]. It turns out that the same statement can be made in the critical case if we assume that k  ≥  4. This, however, does not follow from our proof above, and relies on reworking the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [\cite=DuSi95] for submanifolds of lower regularity. We believe that this can be done if k  ≥  4.

Proofs of the remaining results

Owing to Ho, Jacobowitz and Landweber ([\cite=HoJaLa12]), it is known that any m-dimensional manifold admits a totally real embedding into [formula] if [formula]. When m  ≥  2, [formula], so we can use Lemma  [\ref=lem_tr-iso] to produce an isotropic embedding of M into [formula]. When n = 1, the only compact manifold without boundary is the circle, which has an explicit smooth Lagrangian embedding in [formula] as the boundary of the unit disk. The claim now follows from Theorem  [\ref=thm_isotemb].

To prove our results on polynomial density, we essentially repeat the techniques used in Section [\ref=sec_pfthm2], together with the fact that rationally convex subsets in [formula] can be realized as polynomially convex subsets in [formula].

By the hypothesis, we have a Ck-embedding [formula] so that F(M) is a C∞-smooth isotropic submanifold of [formula]. Let us relabel F(M) as M. Thus, by Theorem 3.1 in [\cite=DuSi95], M is rationally convex. Due to results by Rossi and Basener (stated as Theorem 1.2.11 in [\cite=St07]), there is a [formula] such that the graph is a polynomially convex subset in [formula].

We claim that Γg is totally real. Let [formula] and [formula] denote inclusions maps and [formula] be defined as z  ↦  (z,f(z)). Note that [formula] on Γg, where π:Γg  →  M is the projection map onto the first n coordinates. Then,

[formula]

which is nonzero everywhere on Γg as [formula] is nonzero on M (M is totally real) and (π*)p:TG(p)Γg  →  TpM is a [formula]-linear isomorphism for every p∈M. Thus, Γg is a polynomially convex and totally real smooth subset of [formula].

Now, we can repeat the method used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] to show that polynomials are dense in the space of Ck-smooth functions on Γg. The main ingredients in this case are the analogue of Lemma [\ref=lem_ratnbd] for polynomially convex sets (which is a standard fact) and the Oka-Weil approximation theorem for polynomially convex sets. In view of Remark  [\ref=rmk_norm], we conclude that Ck(M) has (n + 1)-polynomial density.

The second portion of our claim now follows from Theorem [\ref=thm_pd] and the fact (established earlier) that any m-dimensional manifold admits an isotropic C∞-embedding into [formula] if [formula].

Examples and Open Questions

We first show that Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] can be used to improve the bound in Theorem [\ref=thm_optbd] for manifolds with trivializable complexified tangent bundle.

By the Gromov-Lees theorem (see [\cite=AuLaPo94]), the U-parallelizability of M is equivalent to its immersability as a Lagrangian submanifold of [formula]. Now, let [formula] be such an immersion. Then, viewing [formula] as a subset of [formula], f(M) is an isotropic subset of [formula]. Thus, by a general position argument (see [\cite=AuLaPo94]), there is an isotropic embedding [formula]. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] and Theorem [\ref=thm_pd], Cl(M), l  ≥  0, has (m + 1)-rational density and (m + 2)-polynomial density.

We now paraphrase Theorem  [\ref=thm_optbd] for low-dimensional manifolds, and pose some open questions. Note that when m = 1, the only manifold in question is the circle, any embedding of which is isotropic in [formula]. So, for any k  ≥  0, the space of Ck-smooth functions on the circle has 1-rational density and 2-polynomial density, and this is optimal.

Surfaces. The case of compact surfaces is explored in [\cite=ShSu15], where it is shown that the space of continuous functions on any surface other than S2 and [formula] has 2-rational density. For topological reasons no compact surface can have 2-polynomial density. Theorem  [\ref=thm_optbd] says that the situation for the two exceptions is not too bad since the space of continuous (or Ck-smooth) functions on any surface has 3-rational density. However, we point out that Izzo and Stout's result in [\cite=IzSt15] implies something even stronger: Ck(M), k  ≥  0, has 3-polynomial density for all surfaces M. Their method, specific to dimension 2, consists of a direct construction of a polynomially convex totally real embedding of a given surface in [formula], and is very different to our approach. The torus [formula] and all nonorientable compact surfaces with negative Euler characteristic that is a multiple of 4 admit a smooth Lagrangian embedding into [formula] (see [\cite=Giv]), and therefore, their Ck-spaces are 2-rationally dense. All other surfaces do not admit C1-smooth totally real embeddings into [formula] (see [\cite=Au90] or [\cite=NeSi16]). So, any RD-basis for their Ck-spaces must contain three elements. These arguments cannot be used for k = 0, and this raises the following interesting

Clearly, such an embedding, if exists, cannot be totally real, and therefore must have either singularities or complex points.

Three-folds. For 3-manifolds M, Theorem [\ref=thm_optbd] guarantees 4-rational density of Ck(M), k  ≥  0. This is optimal, since [formula] does not admit a totally real immersion into [formula] (see [\cite=HoJaLa12]). Therefore, Ck(M), k > 0, has 4-rational density, but not 3-rational density. For a U-parallelizable (and orientable) example, consider M = S3. If Ck(S3), k  ≥  2, has an RD-basis of length 3, then by our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] and [\cite=DuSi95], S3 admits a Ck-embedding in [formula] that is Lagrangian with respect to some Kähler form ω. Due to a result by Gromov [\cite=Gr85], the embedded sphere supports the boundary of a nonconstant holomorphic disc. By Theorem 2.5 in [\cite=DuSi95], this is not possible since [formula]. Thus, Ck(S3), k  ≥  2, cannot have 3-rational density. Note that such techniques do not exclude the possibility that C0(M) has 3-rational density for all three manifolds M. One approach to this problem would be to seek Givental-type results (see [\cite=Giv]) on Lagrangian inclusions of three-manifolds into [formula].

Four-folds. By Theorem [\ref=thm_optbd], Ck(M) always admits 6-rational density for any 4-manifold M. As [formula] does not admit a totally real embedding into [formula], [formula] (k > 0) cannot have 5-rational density. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem_tr-iso], Theorem [\ref=thm_isotemb] and [\cite=HoJaLa12] that Ck(M), k > 0, has 5-rational density precisely when the first dual Pontryagin class of M vanishes. To see that this is optimal, consider M = S4. S4 has vanishing first dual Pontryagin class (for orientable 4-manifolds this condition is equivalent to U-parallelizability) but, since its Euler characteristic does not vanish, it does not admit a totally real embedding into [formula] (see [\cite=We69]). In particular, Ck(S4) (k > 0) does not have 4-rational density.

Higher dimensions. To show that the bound in Theorem  [\ref=thm_optbd] is optimal in all dimensions, we recall the following examples from Theorem 3.2 in [\cite=HoJaLa12]:

[formula] does not admit a totally real embedding into [formula].

M4k  ×  S1 does not admit a totally real embedding into [formula].

[formula] does not admit a totally real embedding into [formula].

[formula] does not admit a totally real embedding into [formula].

In view of the general bound for polynomial density in Theorem [\ref=thm_pd] and the Izzo-Stout [\cite=IzSt15] result for surfaces, we end this discussion with the following
