Introduction

Let A be a C*-algebra. An element V of A is called a partial isometry if vv*v  =  v. Simple examples show that a power of a partial isometry needs not to be a partial isometry again. One therefore calls v a power partial isometry (PPI) if every power of v is a partial isometry again. Examples. (a) In a C*-algebra with identity element e, every unitary element u (i.e. u*u  =  uu*  =  e) is a PPI. In particular, the function u:t  ↦  t is a unitary element of the algebra [formula] of the continuous functions on the complex unit circle [formula], and the operator U of multiplication by the function u is a unitary operator on the Hilbert space [formula] of the squared integrable functions on [formula]. (b) In a C*-algebra with identity element e, every isometry v (i.e. v*v  =  e) and every co-isometry v (i.e. vv*  =  e) is a PPI. In particular, the operators [formula] and [formula] of forward and backward shift, respectively, are PPIs on the Hilbert space [formula] of the squared summable sequences on the non-negative integers. (c) The matrix Vn: = (aij) with ai + 1,i  =  1 and aij  =  0 if i  ≠  j + 1, considered as an element of the algebra [formula] of the complex n  ×  n matrices, is a PPI. (d) If vi is a PPI in a C*-algebra Ai for every i in an index set I, then (vi)i∈I is a PPI in the direct product [formula]. In particular, the operator (V,  V*), considered as an element of [formula], is a PPI. Note that the PPI Vn in (c) and (V,  V*) in (d) are neither isometric nor co-isometric. The goal of the present paper is to describe the universal C*-algebra generated by a PPI. Recall that a C*-algebra A generated by a PPI v is universal if, for every other C*-algebra B generated by a PPI w, there is a *-homomorphism from A to B which sends v to w. The universal algebra generated by a unitary resp. isometric element is defined in an analogous way. The existence of a universal algebra generated by a PPI is basically a consequence of Example (d).

It follows from the Gelfand-Naimark theorem that the universal algebra generated by a unitary element is *-isomorphic to the algebra [formula], generated by the unitary function u. Coburn [\cite=Cob1] identified the universal algebra generated by an isometry as the Toeplitz algebra [formula] which is the smallest C*-subalgebra of [formula] which contains the isometry V, the shift operator. This algebra bears its name since it can be described as the smallest C*-subalgebra of [formula] which contains all Toeplitz operators T(a) with generating function [formula]. Recall that the Toeplitz operator with generating function [formula] is given the matrix (ai - j)∞i,j  =  0 where ak stands for the kth Fourier coefficient of a. This operator is bounded on [formula] if and only if [formula] (see [\cite=BSi1] [\cite=BSi2]).

We will see that the universal algebra of a PPI is also related with Toeplitz operators, via the finite sections discretization with respect to the sequence of the projections [formula] on [formula]. Write F for the set of all bounded sequences (An)n  ≥  1 of operators An∈L(  Pn) and G for the set of all sequences (An)∈F with [formula]. Provided with entry-wise defined operations and the supremum norm, F becomes a C*-algebra and G a closed ideal of F. Since L(  Pn) is isomorphic to [formula], we can identify F with the direct product and G with the direct sum of the algebras [formula] for n  ≥  1. Now consider the smallest C*-subalgebra [formula] of F which contains all sequences (PnT(a)Pn) with [formula] and its C*-subalgebra [formula] which is generated by the sequence (PnVPn) (note that V is the Toeplitz operator with generating function t  ↦  t). With these notations, the main result of the present paper can be formulated as follows. For a general account on C*-algebras generated by partial isometries, with special emphasis on their relation to graph theory, see [\cite=ChJ1].

Before going into the details of the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1], we provide some basic (and well known) facts on the algebras [formula] and [formula]. Since the first entry of the sequence (PnVPn) is zero, the first entry of every sequence in [formula] is zero. So we can omit the first entry and consider the elements of [formula] as sequences labeled by n  ≥  2 (whence the notation). In fact this is the only difference between the algebras [formula] and [formula].

[formula] consists of all sequences (An)n  ≥  2 where (An)n  ≥  1 is a sequence in [formula].

The sequences in [formula] are completely described in the following theorem, where we let Rn denote the operator [formula] on [formula]. Further we set ã(t): = a(t- 1) for every function a on [formula]. This description was found by A. Böttcher and B. Silbermann and first published in their 1983 paper [\cite=BSi0] on the convergence of the finite sections method for quarter plane Toeplitz operators (see also [\cite=HRS2], Section 1.4.2).

The algebra [formula] consists of all sequences (An)n  ≥  1 of the form

[formula]

where [formula], K and L are compact operators, and (Gn)∈G. The representation of a sequence [formula] in this form is unique.

It is not hard to see that the algebra of all pairs ([\ref=e2]) is just the smallest C*-subalgebra of [formula] that contains the PPI (V,  V*). Observe that all of the above examples (a) - (d) appear somewhere in the algebra [formula] and its quotients.

Elementary properties of PPI

Our first goal is a condition ensuring that the product of two partial isometries is a partial isometry again.

Let u,  v be partial isometries. Then uv is a partial isometry if and only if

[formula]

i.e. if the initial projection u*u of u and the range projection vv* of v commute.

Proof. Condition ([\ref=e3]) implies that

[formula]

hence, uv is a partial isometry. Conversely, if uv is a partial isometry, then a simple calculation gives

[formula]

With the C*-axiom we conclude that v*(vv*u*u  -  u*uvv*)  =  0, hence vv*(vv*u*u  -  u*uvv*)  =  0, which finally gives

[formula]

The right-hand side of this equality is selfadjoint; so must be the left-hand side. Thus, vv*u*u  =  (vv*u*u)*  =  u*uvv*, which is condition ([\ref=e3]). In particular, if v is a partial isometry, then v2 is a partial isometry if and only if

[formula]

Let v be a partial isometry with property () (e.g. a PPI). Then

[formula]

is the identity element of the C*-algebra generated by v. Moreover,

[formula]

are mutually orthogonal projections (meaning that pp̃  =  p̃p  =  0).

Proof. Condition ([\ref=e4]) implies that e is selfadjoint. Further,

[formula]

and, similarly, v*e  =  v*. Taking adjoints it follows that ev*  =  v* and ev  =  v, and e is the identity element. The remaining assertions are also easy to check. We will often use the notation v* n instead of (v*)n.

(a) If v is a PPI, then

[formula]

(b) If v is a partial isometry and if () holds for k = 1 and for every n  ≥  1, then v is a PPI.

Proof. Assertion (a) is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=p6] (the partial isometry vn + k is the product of the partial isometries vk and vn). Assertion (b) follows easily by induction. For k = 1, condition ([\ref=e5]) reduces to

[formula]

Thus if v and vn are partial isometries, then vn + 1 is a partial isometry by Proposition [\ref=p6].

If v is a PPI, then (vnv* n)n  ≥  0 and (v* nvn)n  ≥  0 are decreasing sequences of pairwise commuting projections.

Proof. The PPI property implies that the vnv* n are projections and that

[formula]

for k,  n  ≥  0. The assertions for the second sequence follow similarly.

A distinguished ideal

Let A be a C*-algebra generated by a PPI v. By   (v,  v*) we denote the smallest (symmetric, not necessarily closed) subalgebra of A which contains v and v*. Further we write [formula] for the set of all non-negative integers such that pvnp̃  ≠  0. From Proposition [\ref=p8] we know that [formula]. Finally, we set

[formula]

(a) The element pvnp̃ is a partial isometry with initial projection n and range projection πn. Thus, the projections πn and n are Murray-von Neumann equivalent in A, and they generate the same ideal of A. (b) πmπn  =  0 and mn  =  0 whenever m  ≠  n.

Proof. (a) By definition,

[formula]

Since p  =  e  -  vv* and vnv* n commute by Proposition [\ref=p9],

[formula]

Being a product of commuting projections (Lemma [\ref=l10]), πn is itself a projection. Analogously, n is a projection. Thus, pvnp̃ is a partial isometry, and πn and n are Murray-von Neumann equivalent. Finally, the equality

[formula]

shows that πn belongs to the ideal generated by n. The reverse inclusion follows analogously. Assertion (b) is again a simple consequence of Lemma [\ref=l10]. Let Cn denote the smallest closed ideal of A which contains the projection πn (likewise, the projection n). We want to show that Cn is isomorphic to [formula] whenever [formula] (Proposition [\ref=p18] below). For we need to establish a couple of facts on (finite) words in   (v,  v*).

Let a,  b,  c be non-negative integers. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. Let min {a,  c}  ≥  b. Then

[formula]

where we used that v* b is a partial isometry. If a  ≤  b  ≤  c, then

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=p9] (a). Thus,

[formula]

Similarly, v* avbv* c  =  v* avb - c if a  ≥  b  ≥  c. The second assertion of the lemma follows by taking adjoints. Every word in   (v,  v*) is a product of powers vn and v* m. Every product vav* bvc and v* avbv* c of three powers can be written as a product of at most two powers if one of the conditions

[formula]

in Lemma [\ref=l12] is satisfied. Since ([\ref=e6]) is equivalent to max {a,  c}  ≥  b, such a product can not be written as a product of less than three powers by means of Lemma [\ref=l12] if max {a,  c}  <  b. Since it is not possible in a product vav* bvcv* d or v* avbv* cvd of four powers that max {a,  c}  <  b and max {b,  d}  <  c, one can shorten every product of powers vn and v* m to a product of at most three powers. Summarizing we get the following lemma.

Every finite word in   (v,  v*) is of the form vav* b or v* bva with a,  b  ≥  0 or of the form vav* bvc or v* avbv* c with 0  <   min {a,  c}  ≤   max {a,  c}  <  b.

Proof. We only check assertion (a). By the preceding lemma, w is a product of at most three powers vav* bvc or v* avbv* c. First let w  =  vav* bvc. Since vp  =  pv*  =  0, we conclude that c = 0 if pwp  ≠  0. Writing

[formula]

we obtain by the same argument that a = b if pwp  ≠  0. Thus, w  =  vav* a. The case when w  =  v* avbv* c can be treated analogously. An element k of a C*-algebra A is called an element of algebraic rank one if, for every a∈A, there is a complex number α such that kak  =  αk.

Let [formula]. Then (a) πn is a projection of algebraic rank one in A. (b) πm and πn are Murray-von Neumann equivalent if and only if m  =  n.

Analogous assertions hold for n in place of πn. Proof. (a) Every element of A is a limit of linear combinations of words in v and v*. It is thus sufficient to show that, for every word w, there is an [formula] such that πnwπn  =  απn. If πnwπn  =  0, this holds with α  =  0. If πnwπn  =  πnpwpπn  ≠  0, then w  =  vav* a for some a  ≥  0 by Corollary [\ref=c14]. In this case,

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=l10] we infer that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

i.e. α  =  1 if a  ≤  n and α  =  0 in all other cases. (b) The projections πm and πn are Murray-von Neumann equivalent if and only if πmAπn  ≠  {0}. So we have to show that πmAπn  =  {0} whenever m  ≠  n. Again it is sufficient to show that πmwπn  =  0 for every word w.

Suppose there is a word w such that πmwπn  =  πmpwpπn  ≠  0. Then w  =  vav* a for some a  ≥  0 by Corollary [\ref=c14]. The terms in parentheses in

[formula]

commute by Lemma [\ref=l10]. Since

[formula]

for m  ≠  n we conclude that πmwπn  =  0, a contradiction.

(a) If a  >  n or b  >  a, then vbv* aπn  =  0. (b) If b  ≤  a  ≤  n, then vbv* aπn  =  (v*)a - bπn.

Proof. (a) One easily checks that (v*)n + 1p  =  0, which gives the first assertion. Let b  >  a. Then, since p commutes with vkv* k and vp  =  0,

[formula]

(b) Applying Lemma [\ref=l12] to the terms in inner parentheses in

[formula]

one can simplify this expression to

[formula]

In particular, Cn is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. We are now in a position to describe this algebra exactly.

(a) For [formula], the algebra Cn is *-isomorphic to [formula]. (b) CmCn  =  {0} whenever m  ≠  n.

Proof. (a) The elements e(n)ij: = v* iπnvj with [formula] span the algebra Cn by Corollary [\ref=c17] (c). Thus, the assertion will follow once we have shown that these elements form a system of (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) matrix units in the sense that (e(n)ij)*  =  e(n)ji and

[formula]

with δjk the standard Kronecker delta. The symmetry property is clear. To check ([\ref=e7]), first let j = k. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=l16] (b). If j  >  k, then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=l16] (a). Finally, if j  <  k, then

[formula]

again by Lemma [\ref=l16] (a). This proves (a). Assertion (b) follows from Proposition [\ref=p15] (b). Given a PPI v, we let Gv stand for the smallest closed ideal which contains all projections πn. If [formula] is empty, then Gv is the zero ideal. Let [formula]. The ideal generated by a projection πn with [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] by Proposition [\ref=p18], and if u,  w are elements of A which belong to ideals generated by two different projections πm and πn, then uw  =  0 by Proposition [\ref=p15] (b). Hence, Gv is then isomorphic to the direct sum of all matrix algebras [formula] with [formula].

If A is the universal C*-algebra generated by a PPI v, then [formula] is the set of all positive integers. Indeed, the algebra [formula] introduced in the introduction is generated by the PPI v: = (PnVPn), and [formula] in this concrete setting.

PPI with [formula]

Our next goal is to describe the C*-algebra A which is generated by a PPI v with [formula]. This condition is evidently satisfied if one of the projections p  =  e  -  v*v and p̃  =  e  -  vv* is zero, in which cases the algebra generated by the PPI v is well known:

If p  =  0 and p̃  =  0, then v is unitary, and A is *-isomorphic to C(X) where [formula] is the spectrum of v by the Gelfand-Naimark theorem.

If p  =  0 and p̃  ≠  0, then v is a non-unitary isometry, A is *-isomorphic to the Toeplitz algebra [formula] by Coburn's theorem, and the isomorphism sends v to the forward shift V.

If p  ≠  0 and p̃  =  0, then v is a non-unitary co-isometry, again A is *-isomorphic to the Toeplitz algebra [formula] by Coburn's theorem, and the isomorphism sends v to the backward shift V*.

Thus the only interesting case is when [formula], but p  ≠  0 and p̃  ≠  0. Let C and [formula] denote the smallest closed ideals of A which contain the projections p and p̃, respectively. For i,  j  ≥  0, set

[formula]

If v is a PPI with [formula], then (fij)i,  j  ≥  0 is a (countable) system of matrix units, i.e. f*ij  =  fji and

[formula]

If one of the fij is non-zero (e.g. if f00  =  p  ≠  0), then all fij are non-zero.

An analogous assertion holds for the family of the ij. Proof. The symmetry condition is evident, and if fij  =  0 then fkl  =  fkifijfjl  =  0 for all k,  l by ([\ref=e8]). Property ([\ref=e8]) on its hand will follow once we have shown that

[formula]

The assertion is evident if j  =  k  =  0. If j  >  0 and k  =  0, then

[formula]

and ([\ref=e9]) holds. Analogously, ([\ref=e9]) holds if j = 0 and k  >  0. Finally, let j,  k  >  0. The assumption [formula] ensures that

[formula]

for all j  ≥  1. Employing this identity we find

[formula]

Thus, pvjv* kp  =  pvj - 1(v*)k - 1p for j,  k  ≥  1. Repeated application of this identity finally leads to one of the cases considered before.

Let [formula] and p  ≠  0. (a) The ideal C of A generated by p coincides with the smallest closed subalgebra of A which contains all fij with i,  j  ≥  0. (b) C is *-isomorphic to the ideal of the compact operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Analogous assertions hold for the projection p̃, the algebra [formula], and the ij.

Proof. For a moment, write [formula] for the smallest closed subalgebra of A which contains all fij with i,  j  ≥  0. The identities

[formula]

and, for i  ≥  1,

[formula]

(where we used the adjoint of ([\ref=e10])) and their adjoints show that [formula] is a closed ideal of A. Since p  =  f00 we conclude that [formula]. Conversely, we have fij  =  v* ipvj∈C for all i,  j  ≥  0 whence the reverse inclusion [formula]. This settles assertion (a).

For assertion (b), note that every C*-algebra generated by a (countable) system of matrix units (in particular, the algebra [formula]) is naturally *-isomorphic to the algebra of the compact operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space (see, e.g., Corollary A.9 in Appendix A2 in [\cite=Rae1]).

If [formula], then [formula].

Proof. C and [formula] are closed ideals. Thus, [formula], and we have to show that fijkl  =  0 for all i,  j,  k,  l  ≥  0. Since

[formula]

this is a consequence of [formula]. Remember that p  ≠  0 and p̃  ≠  0. From the preceding lemma we conclude that the mapping

[formula]

is an injective *-homomorphism; thus A is *-isomorphic to the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula]. The element v  +  C is an isometry in A  /  C (since e  -  v*v∈C), but it is not unitary (otherwise e  -  vv*∈ would be a non-zero element of C, in contradiction with Lemma [\ref=l22]). Analogously, [formula] is a non-unitary co-isometry. By Coburn's Theorem, there are *-isomorphisms [formula] and [formula] which map v  +  C  ↦  V and v  +    ↦  V*, respectively. But then

[formula]

is a *-isomorphism which maps the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] to the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by the pair (V,  V*). The latter algebra has been identified in Corollary [\ref=c4]. Summarizing we get:

Let the C*-algebra A be generated by a PPI v with [formula] and p  ≠  0 and p̃  ≠  0. Then A is *-isomorphic to the algebra [formula] (likewise, to [formula], and the isomorphism sends v to (PnVPN)n  ≥  1  +  G (likewise, to (PnVPN)n  ≥  2  +  G≥  2).

The general case

We are now going to finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1]. For we think of A as being faithfully represented as a C*-algebra of bounded linear operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H (note that A is finitely generated, hence separable). As follows easily from ([\ref=e7]), [formula] is the identity element of Cn. So we can think of the zn as orthogonal projections on H. Moreover, these projections are pairwise orthogonal by Proposition [\ref=p18] (b). Thus, the operators [formula] form an increasing sequence of orthogonal projections on H. Let P∈L(H) denote the least upper bound of that sequence (which then is the limit of the Pn in the strong operator topology). Clearly, P is an orthogonal projection again (but note that P does not belong to A in general).

(a) Every zn is a central projection of A. (b) P commutes with every element of A.

Proof. Assertion (b) is a consequence of (a). We show that

[formula]

commutes with v. Indeed,

[formula]

again by Lemma [\ref=l12]. Thus, vzn  =  znv. Since zn  =  z*n, this implies that zn also commutes with v* and, hence, with every element of A. Consequently, [formula] where I stands for the identity operator on H. We consider the summands of this decomposition separately. The part (I - P)A(I - P) is generated by the PPI [formula]. Since

[formula]

we conclude that [formula]. Thus, this part of A is described by Proposition [\ref=p23].

The part PAP is generated by the PPI PvP. It follows from the definition of P that [formula] and that GPvP  =  PGvP  =  Gv. We let [formula] stand for the direct product of the algebras Cn and consider the mapping

[formula]

If znAzn  =  0 for every [formula], then

[formula]

Thus, the mapping ([\ref=e11]) is injective, and the algebra PAP is *-isomorphic to the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by the sequence [formula]. Further we infer from Proposition [\ref=p18] (a) that Cn is isomorphic to [formula] if [formula]. We are going to make the latter isomorphism explicit. For we note that

[formula]

We choose a unit vector e(n)i in the range of e(n)ii (recall Proposition [\ref=p15] (a)), and let f(n)i stand for the n + 1-tuple [formula] with the 1 at the ith position. Then (e(n)i)ni = 0 forms an orthonormal basis of   zn, (f(n)i)ni = 0 forms an orthonormal basis of [formula], the mapping e(n)i  ↦  f(n)n - i extends to a linear bijection from   zn onto [formula], which finally induces a *-isomorphism ξn from [formula] onto [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a *-isomorphism which maps the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by the sequence [formula] to the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by the sequence [formula], where Vn is the matrix described in Example (c). Note that Vn is just the n  ×  nth finite section PnVPn of the forward shift operator.

If now A is the universal algebra generated by a PPI v, then [formula], as we observed in Corollary [\ref=c19]. Thus, in this case, the algebra PAP is *-isomorphic to the smallest C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by the sequence (PnVPn), i.e. to the C*-algebra [formula].

It remains to explain what happens with the part (I - P)A(I - P) of A. The point is that the quotient PAP / PGvP is generated by a PPI u for which [formula] is empty. We have seen in Proposition [\ref=p23] that both this quotient and the algebra (I - P)A(I - P) are canonically *-isomorphic to [formula]. Thus, there is a *-homomorphism from PAP onto (I - P)A(I - P) which maps the generating PPI PvP of PAP to the generating PPI (I - P)v(I - P) of (I - P)A(I - P). Hence, if A is the universal C*-algebra generated by a PPI, then already PAP has the universal property, and [formula].
