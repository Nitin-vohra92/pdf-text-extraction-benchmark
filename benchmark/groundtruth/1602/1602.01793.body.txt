Fluxonium-resonator system in the nonperturbative regime

Introduction

Electrical circuits made with superconducting electrodes and Josephson junctions, which conveniently provide dissipation-less nonlinear elements, offer a promising route toward quantum information processing.[\cite=Devoret2013] [\cite=Devoret2004] Complementary theoretical work has typically involved constructing effective circuit Hamiltonians and computing their corresponding spectra. Modeling of these superconducting circuits has been achieved by diagonalizing the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, which treats qubits as two-level systems and hinges upon the rotating-wave approximation.[\cite=Tavis1968] [\cite=Jaynes1963]

Superconducting circuits and their respective microwave measurement chains have recently grown increasingly complex in order to accommodate additional qubits, resonators, and quantum-limited amplifiers.[\cite=Riste2015] [\cite=Kelly2015] [\cite=Chow2014] [\cite=Roch2014] [\cite=vanLoo2013] [\cite=Yan2013] [\cite=Kirchmair2013] [\cite=Roch2012] [\cite=Reed2012] [\cite=Gladchenko2009] [\cite=Niskanen2006] [\cite=Chiorescu2004] Theoretical effort has evolved to incorporate the distributed and multi-mode nature of the microwave environment of the circuit as well as higher qubit levels by assuming the anharmonicity is weak and approximately solving for the low-energy spectrum using perturbation theory.[\cite=Nigg2012] Further accuracy has been obtained by considering the anharmonicities of selected modes to be weak, in which case the approximate spectrum may be found using exact single-mode diagonalization and perturbation theory.[\cite=Zhu2013.1] In this work, we analyze circuits with arbitrarily large anharmonicity using exact diagonalization. This allows for increased accuracy in predicting the energy spectra of these strongly nonlinear circuits and is also necessary for regimes of strong coupling between multiple modes.

The fluxonium qubit is one example of a strongly nonlinear circuit. Unlike the transmon qubit, which comprises a Josephson junction shunted by a large capacitance, the fluxonium qubit is composed of one small Josephson junction shunted by a large linear superinductance.[\cite=Manucharyan2009] While transmon dynamics are governed by multiple Cooper-pair tunneling events, resulting in weak anharmonicity, single Cooper-pair charging effects lead to strong anharmonicity in the fluxonium.

Fluxonium qubits have recently demonstrated relaxation times on the order of [formula] and have been used to probe the dynamics of quasiparticles tunneling across their junctions.[\cite=Vool2014] [\cite=Pop2014] More recently, quantum jumps have been measured on two fluxonium qubits simultaneously using a cascaded quantum-limited amplification setup.[\cite=Kou2015] In addition to its utility in diagnosing various noise sources afflicting superconducting circuits, inductively coupled fluxonium qubits in a 1D chain have been predicted to display a rich quantum phase diagram.[\cite=Meier2015]

Experiments that seek to observe the spectrum and dynamics of the fluxonium qubit, which are relevant both to quantum information processing and condensed matter physics, rely on the use of at least one readout resonator. Recently, this resonator has been realized as an electric dipole antenna inductively coupled to the qubit (Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]b-c).[\cite=Kou2015] [\cite=Vool2014] [\cite=Pop2014] We call this composite antenna-qubit system the "fluxonium artificial atom" due to its substantial electric dipole moment and anharmonicity. The goal of the present work is to achieve a quantitative understanding of the fluxonium artificial atom.

We emphasize that, although our analysis in the present paper is restricted to a single fluxonium atom, our approach extends naturally to more elaborate circuits involving multiple qubits and readout resonators, such as those in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) (Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]a). In fact, virtually any system whose essential behavior can be represented using a quantum circuit consisting of capacitors, inductors, and Josephson junctions can be treated using our method, regardless of the strength of the anharmonicity.

This article is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:theory] we discuss the electrical circuit model of the fluxonium atom and the derivation of its classical Lagrangian. We then diagonalize the linear part of the Lagrangian before proceeding with either second-order perturbation theory or numerical diagonalization to treat the anharmonicity. Sec. [\ref=sec:experiment] examines the agreement between the simulated low-energy spectra and experimental results.

Theory

Circuit Model

Experimentally, the fluxonium qubit is realized as one small Josephson junction in parallel with a series array of [formula] larger Josephson junctions.[\cite=Manucharyan2009] In the limit of large size difference between these two types of junctions, the capacitances and nonlinear inductances across the "array junctions" may be neglected, and they form a collective, linear superinductance of up to [formula].[\cite=Masluk2012] If an external magnetic flux is threaded through this loop with magnitude [formula] (with Φ0 the magnetic flux quantum), the two lowest energy quantum states are approximately the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of counter-circulating persistent-current states, similar to the prototypical flux qubit.[\cite=Manucharyan2009] [\cite=Chiorescu2003] This motivates our use of inductive coupling as the link between the fluxonium qubit and readout resonator. This additional resonator is required for dispersive measurement and, in our system, is an LC oscillator whose capacitance and inductance are formed by an electric dipole antenna and another Josephson junction array, respectively. The inductive coupling is achieved by sharing Josephson junctions between the arrays of both oscillators. The resulting fluxonium artificial atom is depicted by the schematic diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]b.

To analyze this atom, we (i) replace the distributed dipole antenna capacitance by a lumped element capacitor, and (ii) replace the large Josephson junction arrays by single, linear inductors. The former approximation (i) is justified by the antenna length ([formula]) being much larger than the length of the inductance of the readout resonator ([formula]).[\cite=Pop2014] On the other hand, the latter approximation (ii) is permitted in the aforementioned regime where all "array junctions" are much larger than the small Josephson junction of the qubit and the relevant frequencies are below that of the fundamental mode of the array.[\cite=Ferguson2013] [\cite=Masluk2012] Finally, Kirchoff's current law allows us to combine the mirrored unshared inductances of the readout and qubit modes into single inductors (with twice the inductance) since they are arranged in series. Figure [\ref=fig:circuit]c shows the electrical circuit diagram resulting from the above procedure.

Circuit Lagrangian

Having obtained a circuit with five elements, we may impose Kirchoff's voltage law on two distinct closed paths as well as Kirchoff's current law on either node connected to three branches in Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]c. This permits the writing of all five branch fluxes in terms of two degrees of freedom: the flux across the capacitance of the readout resonator, Φr, and that across the small Josephson junction of the qubit, Φq. In the limit that Lq  ≫  Lr  ~  Ls, i.e. the unshared inductance of the qubit is much larger than either the unshared inductance of the readout or the shared inductance, the circuit is well-described by the Lagrangian

[formula]

upon the translation [formula]. Here, Cq and EJ denote the capacitance and Josephson tunneling energy of the small junction of the qubit, respectively, while Cr represents the dipole capacitance of the readout mode. We have also introduced [formula] as the difference in arguments of the superconducting order parameter on either side of the small Josephson junction of the qubit. Analogously, we have defined [formula]. Note that the first two terms in ([\ref=eq:lagrangian]) describe the readout mode and the last three terms correspond to the qubit mode. All coupling between these modes is captured by the bilinear mutually inductive third term.

Normal Mode Decomposition

Next, we notice that ([\ref=eq:lagrangian]) is nothing more than two linearly coupled harmonic oscillators with the addition of a sinusoidal nonlinearity. We decouple the linearized Lagrangian (EJ  →  0 in ([\ref=eq:lagrangian])) by diagonalizing the classical equations of motion. This amounts to changing variables to [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. The Lagrangian is now given by

[formula]

where we have defined [formula] to be the normal mode superconducting phases (with i  =  R,Q). Similarly, [formula] and [formula] denote the normal mode capacitances and inductances given by

[formula]

We note that this normal mode basis, in which the coupling between modes is entirely captured by the anharmonic sinusoidal term in ([\ref=eq:normallagrangian]), conveniently makes obvious the inherited nonlinearity of the readout as well as the non-quadratic nature of the coupling.[\cite=Nigg2012] Hereafter, we assume without loss of generality that |λ1|  ≫  |λ2| and |λ3|  ≪  |λ4|, which may always be done in the limit of weak coupling, so that mode R is vastly more linear than mode Q. This allows us to refer to modes R and Q in ([\ref=eq:normallagrangian]) as the "readout-like" and "qubit-like" modes, respectively, which we will henceforth refer to as "readout" and "qubit."

We proceed by transforming the flux coordinates into [formula] and [formula]. Then, following the classical procedure for constructing a Hamiltonian of a system from its Lagrangian, we define the conjugate charges [formula] for the two normal modes.[\cite=Devoret1997] These steps permit us to write the quantum circuit Hamiltonian

[formula]

by replacing all variables with their operator analogues. Note that the new normal mode capacitances and inductances are given by [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], while the superconducting phases are φi  =  2πΦi  /  Φ0.

Harmonic Oscillator Basis

Since the flux operators and their conjugate charges obey the canonical commutation relation [formula], we are motivated to express the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:circuithamiltonian]) in terms of the raising and lowering operators [formula], for which [formula].[\cite=Devoret1997] Full expansion of the cosine term then results in the Hamiltonian

[formula]

relative to the zero-point energy ωR  +  ωQ)  /  2. In the above, [formula] and [formula] are the normal mode frequencies and zero-point fluctuations of the phases. The criteria for perturbative treatment of an arbitrary term (defined by [formula]) in the expansion ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]) is [formula]. In terms of the superconducting impedance quantum [formula], the zero-point fluctuations of the superconducting phase assume the form [formula], where [formula] is the characteristic impedance. This form highlights the fact that perturbation theory may only be used to discard terms in the expansion ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]) when Zi  ≪  RQ for at least one mode. More generally, perturbative treatment of the Josephson tunneling Hamiltonian is equivalent to an expansion in powers of the characteristic impedance (normalized by RQ).

Up to this point, our approach has mirrored that of "black-box quantization," only differing in our consideration of a novel system: the fluxonium artificial atom.[\cite=Nigg2012] [\cite=Divincenzo2014] Further treatment along such lines would involve truncation of the sum over j in ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]) followed by the use of perturbation theory to handle the remaining inter-mode coupling and nonlinearity. Such a truncation is inappropriate in the fluxonium regime due to sizable zero-point fluctuations of the qubit phase [formula] for typical fluxonium parameters.[\cite=Manucharyan2009] [\cite=Devoret1997] In particular, this demands that terms to all orders in [formula] be retained in ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]).[\cite=Zhu2013.2]

On the other hand, the zero-point fluctuations of the readout phase may be considered small, [formula], allowing us to neglect terms in ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]) for large k and treat the remaining terms perturbatively. We apply such an approach in Sec. [\ref=subsec:perturbation] to the inductive readout-qubit coupling realized by the fluxonium atom, in contrast to the case of capacitive coupling considered in detail by Ref. [\cite=Zhu2013.1] and [\cite=Manucharyan2012].

Without restricting ourselves to a particular parameter regime, we may express ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]) in the normal mode simple harmonic oscillator basis [formula], where n and m correspond to the number of excitations in the readout and

qubit modes, which are the eigenstates of [formula] and [formula]. The above matrix elements can be computed straightforwardly, where Lba are the associated Laguerre polynomials.[\cite=Gradshteyn2007] We may then write the Hamiltonian as the (infinite-dimensional) matrix

[formula]

Approach 1: Perturbation Theory in [formula]

As mentioned in Sec. [\ref=subsec:sho], to treat the readout-qubit coupling perturbatively, it suffices to take [formula] and thus discard the [formula] terms in the Taylor expansion of ([\ref=eq:circuithamiltonian]). This results in

[formula]

which could also have been obtained by neglecting the terms with k  >  2 in ([\ref=eq:hamiltonianexp]). We may then consider the first five terms in ([\ref=eq:approxhamiltonian]) as the unperturbed Hamiltonian, Ĥ0, which is the same as setting [formula] and [formula] in ([\ref=eq:matrixhamiltonian]). Computing the low-energy spectrum for Ĥ0 requires truncating the qubit Hilbert space to finite dimension. This is done by restricting the basis to [formula], with finite m0. The resulting diagonalization of Ĥ0 may be done either analytically or numerically, although m0  ~  20 is typically needed to ensure suppression of truncation errors, in which case numerical methods are the only tractable option. This procedure results in the solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation

[formula]

where μ denotes the qubit excitation. Note that the eigenstates are easily separable; that is, |nμ〉0  =  |n〉|μ〉0 and εnμ  =  ωRn  +  εμ hold. First- and second-order perturbation theory may then be used on the seventh and sixth terms in ([\ref=eq:approxhamiltonian]), respectively. This results in corrections of the form

[formula]

completing the calculation of the low-energy spectrum εnμ  +  δεnμ for the fluxonium atom via perturbative treatment of the readout-qubit coupling.

Approach 2: Numerical Diagonalization

As an alternative to Sec. [\ref=subsec:perturbation], we may instead treat the full analytic expression ([\ref=eq:cosine]-[\ref=eq:matrixhamiltonian]) for the Hamiltonian matrix of the fluxonium artificial atom as in Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]c (when Lq  ≫  Lr  ~  Ls). Computing the low-energy spectrum for the atom now requires truncating both readout and qubit Hilbert spaces to finite dimension. This is done by restricting the basis to [formula], with finite cutoff dimensions n0 and m0. Note that this procedure may be viewed as a perturbative expansion in powers of 1 / n0 and 1 / m0, from which we only retain the leading order terms. As before, we require n0  ~  5 and m0  ~  20 in order to simultaneously minimize truncation errors and computational cost. Such numerical diagonalization yields the full solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation,

[formula]

where the eigenstates are no longer separable. The computed energy spectrum for a particular set of parameters used in "device A" (see Tab. [\ref=tab:params]) as a function of threaded external magnetic flux [formula] is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum]a for the first nine transitions of the fluxonium artificial atom from its ground state.

In order to assign the quantum numbers n and μ to these energy levels, which experience anticrossings as external flux is varied as in Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum], we compare the coupled energy spectrum Enμ to the decoupled spectrum εnμ. The decoupled spectrum has built-in quantum numbers due to the separability of Ĥ0. In the limit of weak coupling, we may simply take n and μ for a given coupled level to be those of the nearest decoupled level. In this scheme, the quantum numbers labeling a chosen energy level abruptly switch at level anticrossings, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum]b.

Figure [\ref=fig:spectrum]b also shows the energy levels calculated from perturbation theory, via the method in Sec. [\ref=subsec:perturbation], including the divergence of the second-order correction (seen in the energy denominator in the second term in ([\ref=eq:corrections])). It is this divergence that prohibits the perturbative treatment for all values of [formula] - when the effects of level repulsion become significant, accurate quantitative prediction of the low-energy spectrum of the fluxonium artificial atom requires numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:matrixhamiltonian]).

Comparison with experiment

The numerically computed low-energy spectrum of the fluxonium atom (Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum]) demonstrates the tunability of the energy levels with external flux. We test the accuracy of our circuit model and analysis by comparing the simulated spectrum to experimentally obtained spectroscopy data at various values of [formula] and for two devices with different parameters (Tab. [\ref=tab:params]).

These devices are measured in an impedance-matched, copper rectangular waveguide mounted in a dilution refrigerator at [formula]. Two-tone microwave pulses are incident on the device and then demodulated at [formula] using a heterodyne interferometry setup (App. [\ref=sec:expdetails]).[\cite=Wallraff2004] This allows for the measurement of the readout 0  →  1 transition frequency, the qubit g  →  e transition frequency, and the dispersive shift χ of the readout by the qubit. Data is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:compare].

It is clear that the measured readout 0  →  1 transition frequency and the qubit g  →  e transition frequency should be compared to the quantities (E1g  -  E0g) / h and (E0e  -  E0g) / h obtained from diagonalization, respectively, in the limit of zero temperature. The dispersive shift χ may also be computed from the simulated low-energy spectrum via

[formula]

These three spectroscopic observables, computed from numerical diagonalization as well as the spectrum, are also plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:compare]. In addition, the dispersive shift calculated from the perturbative approach in Sec. [\ref=subsec:perturbation] is also plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:compare]e-f.

The parameter values in Tab. [\ref=tab:params] are found by fitting these simulated quantities to those measured experimentally. The readout capacitance Cr is predicted independently using a commercial high-frequency electromagnetic solver (Ansys HFSS), a finite-element electromagnetic modeling program. The chief discriminating factor between device A and device B is the qubit-readout coupling strength. The turns ratio between the shared inductance and the qubit unshared inductance is [formula] for device A, while Nq  ≈  0.007 for device B. Moreover, the value of EJ is roughly 50% higher for device B than device A, resulting in a significantly lower g  →  e qubit transition frequency at [formula].

Theoretical and experimental results in Fig. [\ref=fig:compare] agree well, with the exception of two features. First, the location in external flux of the singularity in χ for device A differs between the model and measurements. We attribute this to the e  →  h qubit transition crossing the 0  →  1 readout transition (see Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum]b), which involves the |0h〉 state, whose transition frequency is [formula] from the ground state. Our approximation of the Josephson junction array composing the unshared superinductance of the qubit breaks down at these frequencies due to the fundamental mode of the array occurring at [formula].[\cite=Viola2015] [\cite=Ferguson2013] [\cite=Masluk2012] Second, the dispersive shift computed perturbatively is consistently overestimated in the vicinity of avoided crossings for both device A and (to a lesser extent) device B. This is most apparent at [formula] for device A, at which point χ is calculated to be [formula] using perturbation theory and [formula] using numerical diagonalization, and it stems from the e  →  f qubit transition becoming nearly resonant with the 0  →  1 readout transition (see Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum]a).

The strong variation of the energy spectrum with external flux is apparent in Fig. [\ref=fig:spectrum]a.[\cite=Majer2007] This indicates a valuable feature of the fluxonium artificial atom: the qubit, readout, and qubit-readout coupling behave differently as [formula] is swept. As an additional example, the inherited nonlinearity of the readout resonator may, extracted from the computed energy spectrum, undergoes strong variation with both qubit state and [formula] (App. [\ref=sec:kerr]). This allows access to multiple coupling regimes and cQED Hamiltonians within a single device.

Conclusion

We have constructed an effective circuit (Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]c) and Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:circuithamiltonian]) for the fluxonium artificial atom: a device consisting of a readout resonator and fluxonium qubit, where all inductances are formed by arrays of Josephson junctions and the readout-qubit coupling is realized by a partially shared inductance. The low-energy spectrum of this device has been computed both using numerical diagonalization, which treats the anharmonicity in the Hamiltonian exactly, and using perturbation theory, which assumes the readout-qubit coupling to be small. Quantitative agreement with experimental results was obtained for nearly all values of [formula] using numerical diagonalization. This demonstrates the utility of our method and we expect it to be applicable in diagonalizing a broad class of superconducting circuit Hamiltonians.

Experimental details

The two devices in Sec. [\ref=sec:experiment] are fabricated with aluminum on sapphire substrates using double-angle evaporation. In particular, bridge-free fabrication is used for the Josephson junctions.[\cite=Lecocq2011] The rectangular waveguide enclosing the resulting devices has [formula] insertion loss across frequencies in the passband of [formula]. An applied external magnetic flux is threaded through the qubit (Fig. [\ref=fig:circuit]b-c) by passing a current through a superconducting coil around the mid-section of the waveguide. Thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator, this sample holder is magnetically isolated from its environment using high-permeability metallic and aluminum shields.

Input microwave signals are channeled into the waveguide through [formula] of attenuation as well as infrared-frequency filters.[\cite=Rigetti2012] [\cite=Barends2011] Output signals are passed through two isolators and then amplified using a high-electron-mobility transistor and a commercial microwave amplifier at [formula]. Single-tone spectroscopy using a vector network analyzer is used to determine the readout [formula] transition frequency. We use two-tone spectroscopy to measure the qubit g  →  e transition frequency. This involves sending a [formula] saturation pulse at a variable qubit frequency followed by a [formula] readout pulse at the fixed 0  →  1 transition frequency. Our room temperature heterodyne interferometry setup independently mixes the outgoing readout pulse as well as a reference readout pulse with local oscillator signals (at a frequency detuned from the readout by [formula]) and then digitizes and analyzes the [formula] components. Finally, the dispersive shift χ is measured by applying a π-rotation pulse at the qubit g  →  e transition frequency and then performing pulsed single-tone spectroscopy of the 0  →  1 readout transition with the heterodyne interferometry setup. This is compared to the result from the same procedure with an off-resonant π-pulse to determine χ.

Inherited anharmonicity of the readout

Further proof of the tunability of the fluxonium atom as a function of [formula] is demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:kerr]. The calculated qubit state-dependent inherited anharmonicity of the readout is shown as a function of external flux for device A. We define this inherited anharmonicity as

[formula]

that is, analogously to the self-Kerr effect.[\cite=Kirchmair2013] [\cite=Haroche2006] Remarkably, this inherited anharmonicity changes in sign and order of magnitude for both fixed qubit state and variable [formula], and variable qubit state and fixed [formula].

Input-output theory

In Sec. [\ref=sec:theory]-[\ref=sec:experiment], we have treated the fluxonium artifical atom as a closed quantum system; experimentally, however, the atom is allowed to exchange photons with its waveguide environment. In this appendix, we will attempt to understand quantitatively how the fluxonium atom responds to microwaves traveling through the waveguide.

Depending on its frequency and the relative electric dipole moments of the readout and qubit normal modes, a microwave pulse incident on the fluxonium atom may excite either the readout or qubit mode. We therefore couple transmission lines with impedances ZR and ZQ to the readout and qubit modes, respectively, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:portedcircuit]. Note that the electrical circuit for the fluxonium artificial atom (solid black in Fig. [\ref=fig:portedcircuit]) is drawn according to the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:circuithamiltonian]), so that the inter-mode coupling is entirely captured by a single nonlinear inductive element. This construction, which considers both transmission lines as the waveguide, allows us to treat dissipation from the fluxonium atom using the two-port microwave scattering matrix approach as opposed to the Lindblad master equation formalism.[\cite=Pozar2005]

We proceed by defining the 2  ×  2 impedance matrix Z as that whose elements Zij are given by

[formula]

in accordance with Ohm's law, where Vj is the voltage measured across mode j (with R and Q corresponding to readout and qubit, respectively, as in Fig. [\ref=fig:portedcircuit]) and Ii is the current imposed across mode i. In other words, Zij is the impedance response of the voltage across mode j to a flux across mode i. Taking a time derivative in the Fourier domain, we have

[formula]

in the language of linear response theory, where ω is the probe frequency. Employing the spectral expansion of the Kubo formula, we may write

[formula]

where πnμ denotes the population of the state |nμ〉.[\cite=Giuliani2005] [\cite=Kubo1957] On the other hand, Znμij represents the impedance response of the fluxonium atom perfectly prepared in the state |nμ〉, and it may be expressed as

[formula]

This expression highlights two crucial facts: the impedance response for the state |nμ〉 has poles whenever ω resonates with the [formula] transition and the residues of these poles scale with the matrix elements of the normal mode fluxes between the initial and final transitional states.

The 2  ×  2 scattering matrix S for the fluxonium artificial atom is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] depict incoming and outgoing voltage waves for mode i (see Fig. [\ref=fig:portedcircuit]). We note that [formula] and that the characteristic impedance of the transmission line connected to mode i is defined so that [formula], again invoking Ohm's law. Here, [formula] and [formula] denote incoming and outgoing current waves for mode i, where [formula]. These relations allow us to write

[formula]

where [formula] is the characteristic impedance matrix. In our treatment, the impedance matrix is purely imaginary (see ([\ref=eq:kubo])), and so dissipation is included in our choice of finite characteristic impedances. In particular, we may take [formula] so that the connected transmission line is matched to the impedance of its normal mode up to multiplication by Qi, the quality factor of the mode. Choosing [formula] and [formula], which correspond to a readout resonator linewidth of [formula] and qubit relaxation time of [formula] at [formula] for device A, we may calculate the state-dependent scattering parameters plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:scattmag]-[\ref=fig:scattang].

Overall, we see that |Sii|  ≈  1 (near perfect reflection) and |SRQ|  ≈  0 (near vanishing transmission), which correspond to our choice of fairly large quality factors and hence weak coupling to the waveguide. On the other hand, arg Sii and arg SRQ experience full [formula] and [formula] rolls, respectively, at each transition frequency - the exception being that the phase response is very small for Sii near its converse mode transition frequencies, which is due to the weakness of the readout-qubit coupling.

The state-dependent scattering matrix completely characterizes the fluxonium artificial atom in the idealized waveguide environment (as modeled by transmission lines connected to constituent modes). In Fig. [\ref=fig:scattmag]-[\ref=fig:scattang], we clearly see readout resonator photon number splitting of the g  →  e qubit transition, a frequency shift of χ in the |0g〉 and |0e〉 phase rolls, and a shift in the readout transition frequency depending on the photon number (the analogue of the self-Kerr effect). We note that more complicated loss mechanisms, such as internal losses, can be added to our model by adding a real part to the impedance matrix. Qualitatively, this will draw the reflection coefficient magnitudes away from unity toward zero (in the limit of critical coupling).

We note that the experimental setup used for the measurements in Sec. [\ref=sec:experiment] does not allow for complete access to the photons leaking out of the qubit mode. However, in fluorescence experiments that intentionally couple the microwave environment to the qubit, we expect these state-dependent scattering parameters to agree well with measurements.
