A proof of the Kazdan-Warner identity via the Minkowski spacetime

The Kazdan-Warner identity

[formula] is the sphere of radius 1 at the origin in the 3-dim Euclidean space [formula]. [formula] has the constant Gauss curvature 1. {x1,x2,x3} is the rectangular coordinate system of [formula]. We denote [formula] the Levi-Civita connection on [formula]. Then the vector fields [formula] are conformal Killing vector fields on [formula], i.e. the diffeomorphisms generated by them are conformal.

g is another Riemannian metric on the sphere [formula]. By the uniformization theorem, there exists a function f on [formula] such that the conformal metric e- 2fg has the constant Gauss curvature 1. Hence there is a diffeomorphism [formula] such that [formula].

In the following of this note, we assume that g is conformal to the standard metric [formula] with the conformal factor e2f. Let Kg be the Gauss curvature of [formula]. Then we have the following from [\cite=K-W]:

We denote [formula] the Levi-Civita connection on [formula]. Then we can rewrite the Kazdan-Warner identity as following

[formula]

Since [formula] is a conformal Killing vector field for [formula], it is also a conformal Killing vector field for g. Actually we have that for any conformal Killing vector field X on [formula],

[formula]

We will give a proof of [\eqref=The_generalized_K-W_identity], thus the Kazdan-Warner identity follows.

The Minkowski spacetime

[formula] is the 4-dim Minkowski spacetime. {x0,x1,x2,x3} is the rectangular coordinate system of [formula]. The metric [formula].

t,r are two functions on [formula]: t = x0 and [formula]. We define the optical functions u,v by [formula] and [formula]. So t = u + v and r = v - u.

Let Cu be the level set of u, which is the future lightcone at the point (u,0,0,0). Let v be the level set of v, which is the past lightcone at the point (v,0,0,0). Let Su,v be the intersection of Cu and v. Su,v is a sphere of radius r = v - u.

We define a map [formula] by [formula]. [formula] is the open half-plane [formula]. Then we have another coordinate system Φ on [formula] given by

[formula]

Let ∂t be the vector field ∂0 and ∂r be the vector field [formula]. In the coordinate system Φ, the coordinate vector fields ∂v  =  ∂t  +  ∂r and ∂u  =  ∂t  -  ∂r.

∂u and ∂v are both null vector fields, i.e. η(∂u,∂u) = η(∂v,∂v) = 0. The inner product of ∂u and ∂v is - 2, i.e. η(∂u,∂v) =  - 2. We see that ∂u and ∂v are orthonormal to the tangent space of any Su,v. So in the coordinate system Φ, the metric [formula].

In particular, when we restrict the coordinate system Φ on the lightcone [formula], we get a coordinate system of [formula]:

[formula]

The induced metric [formula] is degenerated.

The isometric embedding of [formula] into a lightcone of the Minkowski spacetime

Via the coordinate system [formula], we can represent any closed spacelike surface in [formula] as a graph of a function on [formula]. S is a closed spacelike surface in [formula], there exists a unique function h on [formula] such that

[formula]

Conversely for any function h on [formula], the map

[formula]

is an embedding of [formula] into [formula]. Its image

[formula]

is a closed spacelike surface in [formula]. Moreover, [formula] since [formula].

Hence, we can embed [formula] isometrically into [formula] as above by taking h = f.

The geometry of a spacelike surface in the Minkowski spacetime

Let S be a orientable spacelike surface in the Minkowski spacetime [formula]. TS is the tangent bundle and NS is the normal bundle of S in [formula].

Since S is spacelike, η|TS is positive definite and η|NS is of signature (1,1). Hence we can choose a null frame {L,} of NS such that L and [formula] are both future-directed null vector fields and their inner product is - 2, i.e.

[formula]

Such a choice isn't unique, since for any positive function a on S, the frame {aL,a- 1} also satisfies the above conditions.

In the following, we fix such a null frame {L,}. Then we can choose an orthonormal frame {e1,e2} of TS at least locally such that {e1,e2,e3  =  ,e4 = L} is positive oriented in [formula]. Choose the orientation of S to be the orientation of {e1,e2}. Let A,B = 1,2.

The intrinsic geometry of S is given by the induced metric η|S. Let [formula] be the Levi-Civita connection on (S,η|S) and [formula] be the exterior derivative on S. Let ε be the volume form on (S,η|S). We define the intrinsic differential operators [formula] on S by

[formula]

The extrinsic geometry of S in [formula] is given by the null second fundamental forms χ, and the torsion ζ defined as following:

[formula]

χ, are covariant symmetric 2-tensor fields and ζ is a 1-form on S. Let [formula] and [formula] be the traces of χ and [formula] on S, i.e. the contractions with η|- 1S on TS. Let [formula] and [formula] be the tracefree parts of χ and [formula] on S.

In analogy with the Gauss equation and Codazzi equation for a surface in 3-dim Euclidean spacetime, we have the following equations:

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

One can find the proofs of these equations in [\cite=C].

We can apply these equations to S in the lightcone [formula]. We see ∂v along S is a null vector field in NS. So we choose L to be the null vector field ∂v over S. Then we can find [formula] in NS such that {L,} is a null frame of NS.

Since the metric [formula], we see that the induced metric on S deforms conformally when we deform S in the direction of ∂v. This means that the seconded fundamental form χ of S is a multiple of the induced metric η|S. Hence  = 0. So on S, the equations are simpler:

[formula]

The proof of the Kazdan-Warner identity

S is a closed surface in [formula]. Let X be a conformal Killling vector field on (S,η|S). The deformation tensor field (X)π  =  LXη|S of X is a multiple of η|S. Then (X)π  =  (X)Ω  ·  η|S where [formula]. We define the operator [formula] by

[formula]

Then [formula].

[formula]

The last equality follows from that [formula] is tracefree.

Together with the constructions in section [\ref=embedding], we prove [\eqref=The_generalized_K-W_identity].

The gauge transformations on the normal bundle of a spacelike surface in the Minkowski spacetime

Recall that in the section [\ref=geo_of_spacelike_surface], we introduced the normal bundle NS of a oriented spacelike surface S in the Minkowski spacetime [formula]. Since that for any p∈S, the normal space NpS endowed with the induced metric η|NpS is isometric to the 2-dim Minkowski spacetime, we have a 1-dim non-compact abelian group of isometries for (NpS,η|NpS). The group of isometries on (NpS,η|NpS) is just the group of Lorentz rotations of the 2-dim Minkowski spacetime. We can explicitly write down the isometries via the null frame {L,}. Any positive number [formula], we have the mapping La:NpS  →  NpS defined by

[formula]

The group structure is simply given by [formula] for any [formula].

So the normal bundle (NS,η|NS) is a vector bundle on S with the group action of [formula]. Moreover, the null frame bundle of (NS,η|NS) is a principal [formula]-bundle. This principal bundle is actually trivial since we can find a global section, which is a global null frame. The parallel transport on the normal bundle NS defines a principal connection on the null frame bundle. We see that the torsion ζ of a null frame {L,} is actually the connection 1-form for this principal connection. Assume now that a is a positive function over S, then {aL,a- 1} is another null frame of (NS,η|NS). Let us denote ζa being the torsion for {aL,a- 1}. Direct calculation by the definition of the torsion [\eqref=torsion] shows that

[formula]

which is just the transformation formula for the connection form. However [formula] keeps invariant, because it is actually the curvature of this connection. In particular, we can choose a positive function a such that

[formula]

Now Assume that the oriented spacelike surface S is contained in the lightcone [formula]. We take the null frame {L,} of (NSh,η|NSh) such that its torsion ζ satisfies [formula]. Associated with this null frame {L,}, we have the Gauss equations and Codazzi equations. Since  = 0 still holds, we have [formula]. Then the equations

[formula]

imply that ζ = 0. Then we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] is a constant function over S and we can assume [formula] since we can always achieve this by modifying the null frame by a positive constant. So we get that

[formula]

We consider the following operator [formula] taking a 2-covariant symmetric, traceless tensor ξ into the 1-form [formula]. The L2-adjoint of [formula] is the operator taking a 1-form f into the 2-covariant symmetric, traceless tensor [formula], where [formula] is the traceless part of the Lie derivative of η|S with respect to the vector field [formula]. This can be shown as the following:

[formula]

The kernel of the L2-adjoint of [formula] consists of the 1-form f such that [formula] is a conformal Killing vector field. Since the range of [formula] is L2 orthogonal to the kernel of its L2-adjoint, then the identity [\eqref=The_generalized_K-W_identity] follows from [\eqref=integrability_condition].
