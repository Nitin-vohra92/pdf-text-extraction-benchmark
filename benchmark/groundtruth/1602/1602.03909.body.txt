Evolution of Intrinsic Scatter in the SFR-Stellar Mass Correlation at 0.5<  z<  3

INTRODUCTION

A central issue in understanding how galaxies form is whether star formation is a gradual, continuous process or whether it happens in bursts. The widely reported correlation between Star Formation Rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*) in star-forming galaxies ("main sequence"; e.g.,  [\citealt=2007ApJ...660L..43N] [\citealt=2007ApJS..173..267S] [\citealt=2007ApJ...670..156D] [\citealt=2011ApJ...738..106W]) provides an observational means to address this issue. Because M* is related to past-average SFR, the small total observed scatter around this correlation (~   0.3 dex at z [formula] 2; [\citealt=2013ApJ...770...57B]) suggests gradual assembly of stellar mass, as opposed to bursty star formation.

Bursty star formation introduces scatter to the SFR-M* relation and diversity to star formation histories (e.g.,  [\citealt=2014ApJ...785L..36A]); it is found to dominate the evolution of low-mass galaxies in simulations [\citep=2015MNRAS.451..839D] [\citep=2014ApJ...792...99S] and in observations of local galaxies (e.g.,  [\citealt=2015MNRAS.450.4207B] [\citealt=2014MNRAS.441.2717K] [\citealt=2014ApJ...789..147W]). In particular, [\citet=2010ApJ...721..297M] find starbursts in dwarf galaxies to occur with durations in the 100 Myr - 1 Gyr range that will be probed here. Furthermore, stochasticity in star formation may arise at low SFR values due to sampling effects [\citep=2012ApJ...745..145D] [\citep=2014MNRAS.444.3275D] [\citep=2011ApJ...741L..26F].

Guides to the extensive SFR-M* literature can be found in [\citet=2013ApJ...770...57B] and [\citet=2014ApJS..214...15S]. Studies to date have not modeled scatter. The typically reported total observed scatter includes SFR and M* measurement uncertainties, and covariances as well as the underlying intrinsic scatter. However, cosmological galaxy evolution simulations make predictions for the physically meaningful quantity, intrinsic scatter, which in the absence of measurement errors and covariances, is the standard deviation (dex) of the SFR-M* fit residuals. In this Letter, we present an analysis of the SFR-M* relation that specifically addresses intrinsic scatter.

To probe SFR-M* to the lowest possible mass, we utilize photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the Hubble Ultradeep Field (HUDF; [\citealt=2006AJ....132.1729B]), including HUDF12 ([\citealt=2013ApJ...763L...7E] [\citealt=2013ApJS..209....3K]; see also [\citealt=2013ApJS..209....6I]), UVUDF [\citep=2013AJ....146..159T] and the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS; [\citealt=2011ApJS..197...35G] [\citealt=2011ApJS..197...36K]). Magnitudes are in the AB system; we use the cosmology ΩΛ = 0.7, Ω0 = 0.3, and H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1.

DATA AND SAMPLE SELECTION

We form samples of galaxies for analysis from CANDELS GOODS-S and UVUDF photometric catalogs. We utilize the selection criteria of [\citet=2015ApJ...801...97S] to reject poor quality data, stars and AGN. We utilize exceptionally deep HUDF photometry since our primary motivation is to probe to low mass, while the larger, complimentary CANDELS data provides overlapping and continuous coverage of the mass range up to [formula] M[formula]. Notably, the HUDF photometry enables detecting dwarf galaxies with M*  ~  107 M[formula] at z > 0.5 (compare with the Small Magellanic Cloud, M*  ~  108 M[formula]).

We select sources in the redshift range 0.5  <  z  ≤  3.0, including 2444 spectroscopic redshifts. In the larger CANDELS catalog, we require spectroscopic redshifts; cross-listings in the smaller UVUDF catalog [\citep=2015AJ....150...31R] use grism (3D-HST; [\citealt=2014ApJS..214...24S]) or photometric redshifts. UVUDF photometric redshifts have fewer outliers than CANDELS photometric redshifts [\citet=2015AJ....150...31R]. Using the best-available redshifts is preferable for estimating scatter, see Section [\ref=ResultsSection]. We form samples in five redshift bins 0.5  <  z  ≤  1.0, [formula], 1.5  <  z  ≤  2.0, 2.0  <  z  ≤  2.5, 2.5  <  z  ≤  3.0 that have 1369, 1100, 673, 439, 435 sources respectively.

We use 17 bands from the CANDELS photometry (U-band through IRAC; [\citealt=2013ApJS..207...24G]) to generate input data for fits to the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), which are used to estimate physical parameters such as SFR and M*.

METHOD

We fit SEDs with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based program [\citep=2011ApJ...737...47A] [\citep=2012IAUS..284...42A] to estimate SFR, M*, E(B - V) (spectral reddening), age and star formation history timescale, τ (discussed below). Age varies from 1 Myr to the age of the universe at each (binned) galaxy redshift. Ages are found to fall between ~  100 Myr - 1 Gyr, with no ages younger than 10 Myr; however, the 1 Myr lower limit was found to improve χ2 for several sources compared to a more stringent 10 Myr lower limit.

Galaxy mass varies between 104  -  1015M[formula]; E(B - V) varies from 0.01 - 0.99. τ is sampled logarithmically from 0.02 - 4.99 Gyr. We use [\citet=2003MNRAS.344.1000B] stellar templates, including nebular emission lines, [\citet=1959ApJ...129..608S] Initial Mass Function (IMF), and [\citet=2000ApJ...533..682C] dust attenuation law. Metallicity is fixed at [formula]; fits at solar metallicity have generally poor convergence and larger parameter uncertainties. We utilize parameter uncertainties and covariances for each galaxy.

We explore several continuous star formation histories including constant, linear, exponential ("τ model") and linear-exponential ("delayed τ model"). The linear-exponential model [\citep=2010ApJ...725.1644L] permits both rising and falling star formation, and yields comparable median χ2 values as the next best model (exponential). We report results obtained with this model, and estimate its parameters, t0 (time-to-peak) and τ (decay timescale). Instantaneous SFRs are most sensitive to star formation within [formula] Myr before observation. These SFRs are less sensitive to short timescale (e.g. 10 Myr) variations than spectroscopic indicators (Hα), and yield lower scatter than them [\citep=2014MNRAS.445..581H] [\citep=2015MNRAS.451..839D].

We reject SEDs with bad fits (χ2  >  50; 263, 229, 186, 158, 80 galaxies in each redshift bin, respectively), or poor convergence (GR >  0.2; [\citealt=Gelman1992]; 131, 95, 55, 62, 30 galaxies). SED fits with large χ2 values have potentially under-estimated parameter uncertainties which overestimates scatter. Our final redshift-binned samples have 958, 692, 466, 246, and 326 galaxies for SFR-M* analysis.

For each sample, we fit log SFR and log M* values to the model:

[formula]

The parameters a and b describe the linear relationship and the Gaussian random variable, N(0,σIS), with zero mean and unknown standard deviation, σIS, describes intrinsic scatter. We use the analytic method of [\citet=Fuller1987], F87 hereafter, to estimate parameters in the presence of uncertainties and covariances. A full-width tenth maximum clipping range is obtained from the histogram of initial fit residuals to exclude outliers (our results are insensitive to the details of clipping). We re-fit the outlier-clipped data to estimate the model parameters.

RESULTS

Results include estimated parameters for five redshift-binned samples spanning the mass range [formula] M[formula]. Figure [\ref=FIGURE:01] shows the SFR vs M* data and fits; we find significant correlations (Pearson r2 values in the range 0.66  -  0.81). We compare with [\citet=2014ApJ...795..104W] over their redshift range 0.5  <  z  <  2.5, and the meta-analysis of [\citet=2014ApJS..214...15S].

Figure [\ref=FIGURE:02] shows that residuals do not suggest deficiencies in the model or the fits: the band of residuals clusters around zero (suggestive of a good fit) and does not curve with M* (higher order model is not needed). We find more negative residuals than positive residuals due to an age-gradient effect: age decreases toward the upper left in Figure [\ref=FIGURE:01], roughly perpendicular to the best-fit line. Consequently, there is a sharp upper cutoff in the locus of galaxies as age diminishes toward zero; older galaxies are found below and to the right.

The distributions of total scatter of the mass-binned residuals are indicated in the bottom panels of Figure [\ref=FIGURE:02]. Box plots indicate the inter-quartile ranges, and red lines indicate the medians, which are near zero.

The estimated parameters are shown in Figure [\ref=FIGURE:03] and Table [\ref=TABLE:01]. We detect intrinsic scatter in all redshift bins; scatter increases with cosmic time from the highest redshift bin to the lowest bin, from 0.220 dex to 0.427 dex for intrinsic scatter and 0.369 dex to 0.525 dex for total scatter, respectively. The estimated slope is near unity, and we find the intercept to decrease with cosmic time, similar to trends found in [\citet=2014ApJ...795..104W].

We do not find the turnover in slope above log M*  ~  10 M[formula] that has been previously reported [\citep=2015ApJ...801...80L]; our study, aimed at low mass, has small number statistics above log M*  >  10.5. Below log M*  ~   8.0, we continue to find a linear trend.

Table [\ref=TABLE:02] shows intrinsic and total scatter in mass-binned sub-samples. For each sub-sample, the linear model parameters are pinned and only the intrinsic scatter is estimated. At each redshift, the total scatter is relatively constant across the mass range; it is smallest at low mass, and relatively constant or somewhat increasing toward higher mass. The scatter does not increase in the lowest mass bin, which is particularly surprising because, as mentioned above, scatter in SFR-M* is greater at low mass in local dwarf galaxies, and also in simulations. Because scatter is associated with bursty star formation, these results suggest that at log M*  ~  7, we do not see a significant increase in burstiness compared to higher masses.

TREATMENT OF UNCERTAINTIES

Our analysis incorporates covariances between SED fit parameters, which are non-negligible. Median, correlated SFR and M* uncertainties are indicated as error ellipses in Figure [\ref=FIGURE:01]. M* uncertainties increase toward lower mass; SFR uncertainties and covariances exhibit no trend with mass. SFR tends to be anti-correlated with M*, e.g.,  the 1.0  <  z  ≤  1.5 SFR-M* correlation has mean =  - 0.46. Neglecting covariances over-estimates intrinsic scatter by [formula]%, whereas slope and intercept estimates are not significantly affected.

Uncertainties to SFR- M* model parameters are determined by simulation. Random realizations are formed from the best-fit model; additional Gaussian random noise and intrinsic scatter are added. Simulations have 1000 realizations, and use the same analysis as on the observed data. Uncertainties are given by the standard deviations of the resulting true error distributions.

To assess systematics, we use several fitting methods. We use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (χ2 minimization) and Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR), although they do not use the fully available uncertainties and covariances or estimate intrinsic scatter. We also implement methods that estimate intrinsic scatter [\citep=2002ApJ...574..740T] [\citep=2007ApJ...665.1489K] or account for it [\citep=1996ApJ...470..706A].

We separately compute the intrinsic scatter variance, σ2IS, from the fit residuals, ie. total scatter, 〈σ2T〉, (where 〈〉 denotes the sample mean) and the log M* and log SFR errors, σX,σY respectively, the covariances, [formula], and slope, a, which are related as:

[formula]

We implement this computation for methods that do not explicitly model scatter. For large scatter, we find excellent agreement between methods (e.g. less than 2% variation for σIS  ~  0.24) and at low intrinsic scatter we find significant dispersion (e.g. 66% variation for σIS  ~  0.08).

To determine the systematic effect of spectroscopic redshift selection, we analyze an independent sample of number-matched photometric redshift sources from CANDELS (combined with the UVUDF sources) in the range 1.0  <  z  ≤  1.5. We find that total scatter and outlier fractions are unchanged. However, intrinsic scatter is reduced in the photometric sample by [formula]% in methods without covariances, and ~  60% in methods that use covariances. The total scatter is unchanged in the photometric sample, whereas the less-accurate photometric redshifts increase the scatter due to M*. Thus reduced intrinsic scatter in the photometric sample follows from Equation [\ref=EQUATION:scatter]; the remaining available variance in the "scatter budget" available to intrinsic scatter is reduced. This observations affirms our using the best available photometric redshifts.

We investigate whether our results may be biased by incompleteness. We pay particular attention to low-mass galaxies (log M[formula]) that are detected predominantly in UVUDF, and for which mass incompleteness sets in at z > 1 in CANDELS data. The UVUDF detection image is an average of eight wavebands from F435W redward to F160W, and therefore has a complex selection function. To approximate this function in the SFR-M* plane, we use a UVUDF flux density threshold corresponding to magnitude 29.0 in the detection image. We use SED model parameters to express this detection threshold in terms of SFR and M*; these selection functions are shown as black curves in Figure [\ref=FIGURE:01]. We are insensitive to galaxies below and to the left of these curves. We cannot rule out the possibility of extremely passive galaxies far from the SFR-M* correlation from having been missed; however, such galaxies would be excluded from our analysis as outliers. Thus our results are robust to this incompleteness. However, above z  >  2, these curves suggest that scatter estimates at low mass are significantly affected by incompleteness.

We also investigate the dependence of our results upon the assumed form of the star formation history. We completed analyses with SED fit parameters obtained from constant and exponential star formation histories in addition to the linear-exponential model. For example, at 1.0  <  z  ≤  1.5, intrinsic scatter is 0.13, 0.20, 0.28 dex for the constant, linear-exponential and exponential star formation histories, respectively. Thus varying star formation history reveals a systematic uncertainty of [formula], with constant star formation history leading to the lower value and the exponentially declining leading to the higher value; the true systematic uncertainty may be less given the unphysical assumptions of the alternate star formation histories.

As with any parameter estimation, the fidelity of our results depends upon the efficacy of the model, which in the present case includes the assumed form of the star formation history. We adopt the linear-exponential model because of its flexibility and good SED fits compared to available alternatives. A logical extension of this work would be to include more complex star formation histories that include multiple bursts (our preferred, linear-exponential model effectively accommodates a single, initial burst) and determine from simulation the extent to which the data can discriminate between alternatives.

CONCLUSION

These results extend the study of the SFR-M* relationship of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 0.5  <  z  ≤  3 by more than an order of magnitude in stellar mass. This lower mass limit of ~  107 M[formula] is comparable to dwarf galaxies in the local universe. We use SED fitting to estimate SFR and M* as well as their uncertainties and covariances. Where measurable, we find the intrinsic scatter to be a substantial fraction ([formula] 50%) of the total scatter. We find the intrinsic scatter to be [formula] dex, see Tables [\ref=TABLE:01] and [\ref=TABLE:02]. These values are somewhat larger than the simulations of [\citet=2010MNRAS.405.1690D], who find σ  =  0.11 dex at [formula], but are in good agreement with the Illustris simulations in the overlapping mass range M*  >  108 M[formula] below [formula] [\citep=2015MNRAS.447.3548S]. We encourage modelers to report their observables to even lower mass for comparison with these observations.

We find the intrinsic scatter in the SFR-M* relation to increase with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) by about a factor of two across the range 2.5  >  z  >  0.5, although most of this increase occurs for a single redshift bin, 0.5  <  z  ≤  1.0. Increasing scatter with cosmic time is also found in the models of [\citet=2015MNRAS.453.4337S] and [\citet=2015MNRAS.447.3548S].

At each redshift, we find the scatter to be relatively constant (or slightly decreasing) toward lower mass, particularly above z > 1, in disagreement with trends for broadband SFR reported in the theoretical studies of [\citet=2015MNRAS.451..839D] and [\citet=2015arXiv151003869S]. These studies each report substantially larger scatter at low masses for Hα based SFRs than the broadband ones used here. SED fitting is sensitive to [formula]100 Myr timescale variability, while spectroscopic indicators are needed for shorter time variability. We interpret the absence of increased scatter to mean that such intermediate or long timescale variability does not dominate the star formation histories of low-mass galaxies.

Without specifically addressing the timescale issue, the simulations of [\citet=2015MNRAS.453.4337S], predict a moderate increase in scatter toward low mass in the range M*  >  108 M[formula] over our redshift range, whereas the simulations of [\citet=2015MNRAS.447.3548S] and [\citet=2010MNRAS.405.1690D] show constant scatter with mass down to M*  =  109 and M*  =  108 M[formula] respectively. In these simulations, SFR is computed from molecular hydrogen gas density and empirically motivated models of sub-grid physics.

The origin of the confinement of star-forming galaxies to a narrow SFR-M* correlation is a theoretical question of major interest (e.g.,  [\citealt=2010MNRAS.405.1690D] [\citealt=2015arXiv150902529T] [\citealt=2015arXiv150804842R] and references therein). [\citet=2015arXiv150902529T] show that it could be understood in terms of the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. In any case, the low scatter we observe suggests a remarkable consistency in star formation spanning 3-4 orders of magnitude in galaxy stellar mass. It invites comparison with other dynamical systems across a variety of disciplines from physics to biology where power law scaling relations are associated with self-regulating dynamics.
