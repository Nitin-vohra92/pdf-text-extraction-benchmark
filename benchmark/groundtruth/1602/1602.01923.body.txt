Poisson Law for returns of Maps on Compact Manifolds

Introduction

The limiting distribution of higher order return times in dynamics goes back to Doeblin [\cite=Doe] who establised the Poisson distribution in the the limit for the Gauss map at the origin. In more recent times there has been a large number of results for returns to cylinder sets where certain mixing properties are assumed. Pitskel [\cite=Pit] proved for Axiom A maps and equlibrium measures for Hölder continuous potentials that unions of cylinder sets have in the limit Poisson distributed return times. An approximation argument allowed him then to also deduce the same result for balls in the case of an Axiom A map on the two dimensional torus. He showed that the moments converge and then invoked a theorem of Sevast'yanov to conclude that the return times are Poissonian in the limit. Other subsequent results like by Denker [\cite=Den] which is along similar lines and in [\cite=HSV] which considers parabolic maps on the interval extended those results to more general settings. For rational maps this was done in [\cite=H00] which allowed approximations for balls if the dimension of the measure was not too large. More recently in [\cite=Ab3] [\cite=AV1] results were obtain for φ-mixing and α-mixing systems along a nested sequence of cylinder sets. Using the method of Chen and Stein the Poisson distribution was established in [\cite=HP10] along sequences of unions of cylinders for φ-mixing systems over countable alphabets. This also allowed for approximations for balls under some favourable conditions. In [\cite=HY14] this was extended to α-mixing systems and applied to the returns to Bowen balls. For a review see e.g. [\cite=H13].

For returns to geometric balls apart from Pitskel's result [\cite=Pit] from 1990 all results are quite recent except for the one by Pitskel and on intervals where approximations by cylinder sets can easily be used. For systems that can be modelled by Young towers, Chazottes and Collet [\cite=CC13] proved the limiting distribution to be Poissonian if the decay of correlations are exponential and the unstable manifold is one dimensional. This was generalised to polynomially decaying correlations and arbitrary dimensions in [\cite=HW14]. In this case the speed of convergence is polynomial in the logarithm of the radius of the return ball. A similar result without speed of convergence was obtained in [\cite=PS] by using the Lebesgue density theorem. In this paper we provide a limiting result for maps on manifolds whose correlations decay and which satisfy a certain uniform contraction property (Assumption (V) below).

Assumptions and main results

Let M be a manifold and T:M  →  M a map with the properties described below in the assumptions. Let μ be a T-invariant probability measure on M.

For a ball [formula] we define the counting function which tracks the number of visits a trajectory of the point x∈M makes to the ball [formula] on an orbit segment of length [formula], where t is a positive parameter. (We often omit the sub- and superscripts and simply use ξ(x).)

Let Γu be a collection of unstable leaves γu and Γs a collection of stable leaves γs. We assume that [formula] consists of a single point for all (γu,γs)∈Γu  ×  Γs. The map T contracts along the stable leaves and similarly T- 1 contracts along the unstable leaves.

For an unstable leaf γu denote by μγu the disintegration of μ to the γu. We assume that μ has a product like decomposition dμ = dμγudυ(γu), where υ is a transversal measure. That is, if f is a function on M then

[formula]

If γu,u∈Γu are two unstable leaves then the holonomy map [formula] is defined by [formula] for [formula], where γu(x) be the local unstable leaf through x.

Let us denote by [formula] the Jacobian of the map Tn with respect to the measure μ in the unstable direction.

Let γu be a local unstable leaf. Assume there exists R > 0 and for every [formula] finitely many yk∈Tnγu so that [formula], where BR,γu(y) is the embedded R-disk centered at y in the unstable leaf γu. Denote by ζφ,k  =  φ(BR,γu(yk)) where [formula] and [formula] denotes the inverse branches of Tn. We call ζ an n-cylinder. Then there exists a constant L so that the number of overlaps [formula] is bounded by L for all [formula] and for all k and n. This follows from the fact that Nφ,k equals [formula] which is uniformly bounded by some constant L.

We make the following assumptions: (I) Decay of correlations: There exists a decay function λ(k) so that

[formula]

for functions H which are constant on local stable leaves γs of T. (II) Dimension: There exist 0 < d0 < d1 such that ρd0  ≥  μ(Bρ)  ≥  ρd1. (III) Unstable dimension: There exists a u0 so that μγu(Bρ(x))  ≤  C1ρu0 for all ρ > 0 small enough and for almost all x∈γu, every unstable leaf γu. (IV) Distortion: We require that [formula] for all x,y∈ζ and n, where ζ are n-cylinders in unstable leaves γu and ω(n) is a non-decreasing sequence. (V) Contraction: There exists a function [formula] which decays at least summably polynomially, i. e.  δ(n)  =  O(n-  κ) with κ  >  1, so that ζ  ≤  δ(n) for all n-cylinder ζ and all n. (VI) Annulus condition: Assume that for some η,β > 0:

[formula]

for every r < ρ0 for some ρ0  <  ρ (see remark below).

For a positive parameter [formula] define the set

[formula]

where ρ > 0. The set Vρ represents the points within M with very short return times.

Return times are Poisson distributed
