Random Chain Complexes

Introduction

We study random, finite-dimensional, ungraded chain complexes over a finite field and we are interested in the probability that such a complex has homology of a given dimension. We show that for a uniformly distributed differential the complex has the smallest possible homology with the highest probability.

To be more specific, consider an n-dimensional vector space V over a finite field [formula] of order q and let D be a differential on V, i.e., a linear operator D:V  →  V with D2 = 0. We are interested in the probability pr(q,n) with which a chain complex (V,D) has homology [formula] of a given dimension r for fixed n and q. The differential D is uniformly distributed and pr(q,n) is simply the ratio cr(q,n) / c(q,n), where cr(q,n) is the number of complexes with r-dimensional homology (see Theorem [\ref=thm:number]) and c(q,n) is the number of all complexes.

We mainly focus on large complexes, i.e., on the limits as q or n go to infinity. Clearly, r and n must have the same parity and we separately analyze the asymptotic behavior of the sequence [formula], where n is even, and the sequence [formula] for n odd.

As q  →    ∞   with n fixed, the probability concentrates in the lowest possible dimension, i.e., p0(q,n)  →  1 or p1(q,n)  →  1 depending on the parity of n, while pr(q,n)  →  0 for r > 1. This is consistent with the observation that over [formula] and even [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=lemma:D]) a generic complex has 0- or 1-dimensional homology, i.e., that such complexes form the highest dimensional stratum in the variety of all n-dimensional complexes. Indeed, one can expect the probability distributions for large q to approximate the generic situation in zero characteristic. We do not know, however, if the density functions converge in any sense as q  →    ∞   to some probability density on the variety of n-dimensional complexes over, e.g., [formula].

When q and r are fixed and n  →    ∞   through either even or odd integers depending on the parity of r, the situation is more subtle. In this case, all limit probabilities pr(q) =  lim n  →    ∞pr(q,n) are positive. However, the sequences [formula] and [formula] are super-exponentially decreasing and for a large q all terms in these sequences but the first one are very close to zero while the first is then, of course, close to 1. When q = 2 and r is even, we have p0  ≈  0.6, p2  ≈  0.4, p4  ≈  0.0075 and other terms are very small. We explicitly calculate the ratios pr(q) / p0(q) and pr(q) / p1(q) and p0 and p1 in Theorem [\ref=thm:prob].

The proofs of these facts are elementary and quite simple. However, we have not been able to find our results in the literature or any probability calculations in this basic case where chain complexes are stripped of all additional structures including a grading. In contrast, random complexes of geometrical origin and underlying random geometrical and topological objects have been studied extensively and from various perspectives. Among such random objects are, for instance, random simplicial complexes of various types (see [\cite=ALLM] [\cite=BK] [\cite=CF14] [\cite=CF15] [\cite=Ka] [\cite=Me] [\cite=MW] [\cite=PS] [\cite=YSA] and references therein) and random Morse functions (see, e.g., [\cite=Ar06] [\cite=Ar07] [\cite=CHKW] [\cite=Ni]).

These works utilize several models of randomness all of which appear to be quite different from the one, admittedly rather naive, used here. This makes direct comparison difficult. One way to interpret our result is that, for a large complex, sufficiently non-trivial homology is indicative of the presence of some structure, a constraint limiting randomness. Note that such a structure can be as simple as a [formula]-grading confined to a fixed range of degrees. A dimensional constraint of this type is usually inherent in geometrical complexes, and it would be interesting to analyze its effect (if any) on the probability distribution in our purely algebraic setting. Another consequence of the result is that the assertion that a complex has large homology carries more information than the assertion that it has small homology.

The main motivation for our setting comes from Hamiltonian Floer theory for closed symplectic manifolds; see, e.g., [\cite=Sa] and references therein. The Floer complex is generated, roughly speaking, by the fixed points or one-periodic orbits of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. In many instances, e.g., often generically or for all symplectic manifolds with vanishing first Chern class, the dimension of this complex grows with the order of iteration; see [\cite=GG:CC-survey]. Even when the complex is [formula]-graded, the grading is not supported within any specific interval of degrees. (In contrast with geometrical random complexes, the grading range of Floer homology usually grows with the order of iteration ([\cite=SZ]), and while it is not clear how to correctly account for an unbounded grading in a random model, such a grading is unlikely to affect the probability distribution.) Yet, the homology of the Floer complex for contractible one-periodic orbits is isomorphic to the homology of the underlying manifold. Hence, by our result, even though the Floer complex appears to be very "noisy" for large iterations and random on a bounded action scale, it is actually very far from random. For non-contractible orbits, the dimension of the Floer complex is also known to grow in many cases; see [\cite=GG:nc] [\cite=Gu:nc]. However, in this case the Floer homology is zero and the complex may well be close to random.

One aspect of Floer theory which is completely ignored in our model is the action filtration. This filtration is extremely important and, in particular, it allows one to treat Floer theory in the context of persistent homology and topological data analysis; see [\cite=Ca] [\cite=Gh]. This connection has recently been explored in [\cite=PoS] [\cite=UZ]. However, it is not entirely clear how to meaningfully incorporate the action filtration into our model.

Main Results

Let, as in the introduction, (V,D) be an ungraded n-dimensional chain complex with differential D over a finite field [formula] of order q. In other words, [formula] and D is a linear operator on V with D2 = 0. We denote by c(q,n) the number of such complexes, i.e., the number of differentials D. The dimension r of the homology [formula] has the same parity as n and we let cr(q,n) be the number of complexes with homology of dimension r. (In what follows, we always assume that r and n have the same parity.) Clearly,

[formula]

when n is even and

[formula]

when n is odd.

Furthermore, denote by

[formula]

the probability (with respect to the uniform distribution) of a complex to have r-dimensional homology. Our main result describes the behavior of pr(q,n) as the size of the complex, i.e., q or n, goes to infinity.

Let pr(q,n) be as above.

For a fixed n, we have

[formula]

and p0(q,n)  →  1 when n is even and p1(q,n)  →  1 when n is odd as q  →    ∞  .

For a fixed q and r, the limits

[formula]

exist and 0 < pr(q) < 1 for all q and r. Furthermore, when r  ≥  2 is even, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

When r  ≥  3 is odd,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The proof of this theorem is based on an explicit calculation of cr(q,n). To state the result, denote by [formula] the general linear group of k  ×  k invertible matrices over [formula] and recall that

[formula]

Let as above cr(q,n) be the number of n-dimensional complexes over [formula] with homology of dimension r. Then

[formula]

where 2m + r = n.

We do not have simple expressions for the probabilities pr(q,n) and the total number of complexes c(q,n). However, when q = 2, the differentials D are in one-to-one correspondence with involutions of [formula]. (An involution necessarily has the form I + D and, as is easy to see, different differentials D give rise to different involutions.) Hence, c(2,n) is equal to the number of involutions. This number is expressed in [\cite=FV] via a generating function and an asymptotic formula for c(q,n) has been recently obtained in [\cite=FGS]. It is possible that at least when q = 2 our probability formulas can be further simplified using the results from those papers.

Proofs

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:number] is based on the observation that the differential in a finite-dimensional complex over any field [formula] can be brought to its Jordan normal form or, equivalently, a complex over [formula] can be decomposed into a sum of elementary complexes, i.e., into a sum of two-dimensional complexes with zero homology and one-dimensional complexes. To be more precise, we have the following elementary observation.

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over an arbitrary field [formula] and let D:V  →  V be an operator with D2 = 0. Then, in some basis, D can be written as a direct sum of 1  ×  1 and 2  ×  2 Jordan blocks with zero eigenvalues.

When [formula] is algebraically closed, this follows immediately from the Jordan normal form theorem. Hence, the emphasis here is on the fact that the field [formula] is immaterial. For the sake of completeness, we outline a proof of the lemma.

Let us pick an arbitrary basis [formula] of [formula] and extend it to a basis of [formula] by adding elements [formula]. Furthermore, pick arbitrary vectors e'i with De'i = ei. Then [formula] is the required basis of V.

Let D be a differential on an n-dimensional vector space V over a finite field [formula]. Assume that the homology of the complex (V,D) is r-dimensional. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:D], D is conjugate to the map Dr which is the direct sum of r 1  ×  1 zero blocks and m 2  ×  2 Jordan blocks with zero eigenvalues, where 2m + r = n.

Let Cr be the centralizer of Dr in [formula]. The complexes with r-dimensional homology are in one-to-one correspondence with [formula]. Thus, to prove [\eqref=eq:number], it suffices to show that

[formula]

The elements of Cr are n  ×  n invertible matrices [formula] commuting with Dr. In what follows, it is convenient to work with the basis [formula] in the notation from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:D]. Thus we can think of X as a 3  ×  3-block matrix with m  ×  m block X11, the block X12 having size m  ×  r, and X13 being again m  ×  m, etc. In the same format, Dr is then the matrix with only one non-zero block. This is the top-right corner m  ×  m-block, which is I. Then, as a straightforward calculation shows, the commutation relation XDr = DrX amounts to the conditions that X11 = X33, and X21 = 0, X31 = 0 and X32 = 0. In particular, X is an upper block-triangular matrix. Hence, X is invertible if and only if X11 = X33 and X22 are invertible. There are no constraints on the remaining blocks X12, X13 and X23. Now [\eqref=eq:center] follows.

Throughout the proof, we assume that r and n are even. The case where these parameters are odd can be handled in a similar fashion.

As the first step, we express pr(q,n) / p0(q,n) explicitly. Clearly,

[formula]

Using [\eqref=eq:number] or [\eqref=eq:center] and tidying up the resulting expression, we have where as above n = 2m + r and r  ≥  2, which we can then rewrite as

[formula]

Now it is clear that

[formula]

with r  ≥  2 and n fixed. In particular, this ratio goes to zero as q  →    ∞  . The number of the terms in the sum

[formula]

with j ranging through even integers from 0 to n is equal to n / 2 + 1 and thus this number is independent of q. Hence, p0(q,n)  →  1 and pr(q,n)  →  0 when r  ≥  2 as q  →    ∞  . This proves the first assertion of the theorem.

To prove the second part, first note that by [\eqref=eq:ratio]

[formula]

as m  →    ∞   or, equivalently, n  →    ∞   with r and q fixed.

Furthermore, in a similar vein, it is not hard to show that

[formula]

where, on the left, the sum is taken over all even integers from 2 to n and, on the right, the sum is over all even integers r  ≥  2. Therefore, letting n  →    ∞   in the identity

[formula]

we conclude that the limit p0(q) =  lim n  →    ∞p0(q,n) exists and p0(q) = 1 / (1 + S), which proves [\eqref=eq:S]. Now, by [\eqref=eq:lim-ratio], the limits pr(q) =  lim n  →    ∞pr(q,n) for r  ≥  2 also exist, and hence [\eqref=eq:lim] holds. This completes the proof of the theorem.

The sequence cr(q,n) is decreasing as a function of r. This readily follows from [\eqref=eq:ratio].
