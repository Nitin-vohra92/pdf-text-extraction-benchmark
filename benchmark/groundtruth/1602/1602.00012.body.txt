The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. VII. The intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in the core of the Virgo cluster, and a comparison with the Local Group

Introduction

The faint end of the satellite luminosity function is dominated by systems with smooth appearance, low surface brightness, and little gas content or recent star formation activity-the so-called dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies [\citep=Mateo1998] [\citep=vandenBergh2000] [\citep=Grebel2003] [\citep=Tolstoy2009]. In the Local Group, their luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions are similar to those of globular clusters, but their much larger half-light radii imply substantial total masses, making these faint galaxies the most dark matter dominated systems known in the Universe [\citep=Walker2009].

Two observed properties of this population of faint satellites are known to place strong constraints on ΛCDM models of galaxy formation. First, their number is short by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the expectations from the mass function of cold dark matter halos ([\citealt=Klypin1999] [\citealt=Moore1999]; but see [\citealt=Hargis2014]). Attempts to resolve this discrepancy traditionally invoke baryonic mechanisms that lower the efficiency of, or even suppress, star formation at these mass scales-including high gas cooling times, reionization, stellar feedback, and early environmental effects [\citep=White1978] [\citep=Dekel1986] [\citep=Bullock2000] [\citep=Benson2003] [\citep=Mayer2007] [\citep=Okamoto2008]. In passing, we note that the abundance of the gas-rich, star-forming counterparts which exist in the same luminosity regime in the field also seems to be lower than what is predicted by ΛCDM [\citep=Klypin2015]. Obviously, environmental effects can not be invoked in this case. Second, the inferred central dark matter densities in these systems favor constant density cores instead of the steeper density profiles found in dark matter simulations [\citep=Walker2011]. Hydrodynamic simulations suggest that the removal of these dark matter cusps occurs through energetic outflows from supernovae, a mechanism that requires frequent and centrally concentrated bursts of star formation [\citep=Governato2010] [\citep=Pontzen2012] [\citep=Teyssier2013].

[\citet=Penarrubia2012] point out that these two effects place competing requirements for the star formation efficiency in low-mass halos, creating tension in CDM models of galaxy formation. This friction can be alleviated, however, by a combination of baryonic physics and (enhanced) tidal stripping that bring both the inner mass profiles and the abundance of satellites in simulations in agreement with the observations [\citep=Zolotov2012] [\citep=Brooks2013]. Indeed, low-mass quiescent satellites tend to be found in the vicinity of luminous ([formula]) central galaxies [\citep=Geha2012] [\citep=rsj2013b], and dynamical processes have long been proposed to influence their evolution [\citep=Penarrubia2008] [\citep=Kazantzidis2011].

In order to put constraints on the plethora of internal and external mechanisms potentially shaping the properties of faint satellites, it is mandatory to robustly characterize these systems observationally. In this sense, it is only natural to start with the most accessible observables, i.e., their shapes and structural parameters. Importantly, the relatively shallow potential wells in which these galaxies reside ensure that both photoionization and stellar feedback processes, as well as environmental effects, leave recognizable imprints on their stellar structure. For instance, [\citet=Kaufmann2007] show that baryonic processes that act to pressurize gas within low-mass halos naturally lead to the formation of thicker, puffier galaxies towards lower luminosities as a result of their progressively diminishing angular momentum support. In particular, feedback from bursty star formation can result in strong potential fluctuations caused by gas outflows and inflows. The ensuing heating of stellar orbits can drive significant structural variation, including outward migration and thickening of the stellar body [\citep=Teyssier2013] [\citep=El-Badry2015]. Other sources of internal heating, such as dynamical interactions with dark subhalos, may play a role as well [\citep=Helmi2012] [\citep=Starkenburg2015]. Alternatively, tidal effects have the potential to significantly modify the structural (and dynamical) properties of disky systems, creating pressure-supported triaxial objects that in many aspects resemble the satellites of cluster- and group-sized halos [\citep=Mastropietro2005] [\citep=Smith2010] [\citep=Kazantzidis2011] [\citep=Lokas2012] [\citep=Bialas2015].

Until recently, the intrinsic shapes of faint quiescent galaxies have not been studied extensively. This stems from the fact that these are intrinsically faint objects, and the great majority of known and well-characterized dSphs are Local Group satellites-and the number statistics there are low. For example, the complete sample of Milky Way (MW) dSphs studied by [\citet=Martin2008] includes only 21 galaxies, 11 of which are fainter than MV  =   - 7.5 mag. Interestingly, while the classical MW satellites show small apparent ellipticities, the faint population display more elongated shapes. This immediately prompts the suspicion that tidal interactions with the MW are behind the origin of this highly elongated galaxies. Along these lines, [\citet=Lokas2012] find good general agreement between the apparent shapes of MW satellites and simulations of tidally stirred disks orbiting an MW-sized halo. Because the orientation of individual galaxies in the sky is hard to obtain, intrinsic shapes are usually derived on statistical grounds using relatively large samples. Low number statistics still make this task challenging in the Local Group (but again, see [\citealt=Salomon2015]). It is however now possible to study large numbers of faint, quiescent galaxies in the nearby Virgo cluster thanks to the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS).

The NGVS [\citep=Ferrarese2012] is a Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) optical imaging survey of the Virgo cluster covering 104 deg2, from its core to the virial radius. The MegaCam deep imaging delivers a 2 σ surface brightness limit μg  ≈  29 mag arcsec- 2, with excellent image quality (median FWHM = 0.54 arcsec in the i-band). This has allowed us to detect and characterize, in the core region alone ([formula] kpc), hundreds of previously unknown low-mass galaxies down to the luminosity limits of the classical MW satellites, MV  ~   - 8 mag. This constitutes a major breakthrough, not only because of the order(s) of magnitude increase in the sample size, but also because Virgo represents a completely different environment from the Local Group. Here we use the observed apparent axis ratios of a sample of nearly 300 low mass galaxies in the core of the Virgo cluster to infer the distribution of their intrinsic shapes. We will show that these low-mass Virgo satellites are a family of thick, nearly oblate spheroids.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sect:data] we present the dataset, and the detection and structural characterization of faint Virgo galaxies. We then describe the Bayesian framework developed to infer their intrinsic shapes in Section [\ref=sect:method], followed by the main results of our analysis in Section [\ref=sect:ngvs_shapes]. In Section [\ref=sect:discuss] we discuss our results, and compare them with previous efforts in the literature. Finally, in Section [\ref=sect:summary] we summarize our findings.

Throughout this work we adopt the convention that apparent (i.e., observed) quantities are represented with lower case symbols, whereas upper case symbols are used for intrinsic parameters. Thus, a triaxial galaxy with intrinsic semi axes A  ≥  B  ≥  C has an apparent ellipticity (ε) and an apparent axis ratio (q) related through ε  =  1 - q. We furthermore use a common distance modulus (m - M) = 31.09 mag for all candidate Virgo members, corresponding to the mean distance of D = 16.5 Mpc to the Virgo cluster derived through the surface brightness fluctuations method [\citep=Mei2007] [\citep=Blakeslee2009].

Detection and characterization of low-mass quiescent galaxies in Virgo

Sample selection in the NGVS

In this work we use data from the NGVS. Here we only provide a brief overview of the most relevant characteristics of the survey, but the interested reader is referred to F12 for a more detailed description of the survey, datasets and science goals. The NGVS is a CFHT/MegaCam imaging survey of the Virgo cluster covering 104 deg2 in the u*giz bandpasses, supplemented with Ks-band imaging for a fraction of the area [\citep=Munoz2014], as well as a series of dedicated spectroscopic follow-ups. The central 4 deg2 around M87 ([formula] kpc) were observed in a Pilot Programme (PP) that included the r-band as well, and all objects in this study come from this core region. By design, the survey has an excellent image quality, with a median seeing FWHM ≈  0.8 arcsec in the g-band (corresponding to [formula] pc at the distance of Virgo). The Elixir-LSB reduction pipeline [\citep=Ferrarese2012] [\citep=Duc2015] delivers a superb flattening of the sky background, with peak-to-peak residuals of [formula] per cent that result in a 2 σ surface brightness limit μg  ≈  29 mag arcsec- 2 for the final stacked frames. The NGVS is therefore perfectly positioned to carry out, for the first time, an investigation of the properties of low-mass satellites in the Virgo cluster. The identification and characterization of Virgo cluster members will be discussed in detail in an upcoming paper of this series (Ferrarese et al., submitted); here we summarize the most relevant aspects.

The detection of extended, low surface brightness Virgo galaxies in a field contaminated with a far larger number of foreground stars and background objects is a challenge; conventional codes, such as SExtractor [\citep=Bertin1996], tend to regard low surface brightness objects as belonging to compact and/or brighter contaminants. To circumvent the problem, a ring median filter [\citep=Secker1995] was first applied to each g-band image (the NGVS images with the highest signal-to-noise ratio), with radius adjusted to suppress all unresolved sources (stars and globular clusters), as well as compact background galaxies. A specific optimization of SExtractor was then run on the median-kernel smoothed images, thus enabling the identification of low surface brightness sources that are potential Virgo members.

The resulting galaxy catalogue does of course not discriminate between Virgo members and contaminants, and therefore the next challenge is to define membership criteria. These are based on the location of each galaxy in a multi-parameter space defined by a combination of i) galaxy structural parameters, specifically size and surface brightness, measured in appropriately masked original images using galfit [\citep=Peng2002]; ii) photometric redshifts, based on u*,g,i,z, and, when available, r-band photometry; and iii) an index measuring the strength of residual structures in images created by subtracting from each galaxy the best fitting galfit model. The exact combination of axes in this space was selected to allow for maximum separation of known Virgo and background sources. The former comprise spectroscopically confirmed (mostly) VCC galaxies, while the latter are identified, using the same procedure described above, in four control fields located three virial radii away from M87, and presumed to be devoid of cluster members.

The reliability of the procedure was tested in two independent ways. First, 36,500 artificial galaxies were injected in the frames spanning the full range of luminosity and structural parameters expected for genuine Virgo galaxies, and then processed as described above. With few exceptions (for instance galaxies that land in the immediate vicinity of bright saturated stars or near the cores of high surface brightness galaxies), all galaxies with surface brightness high enough to be visible in the frames were indeed recovered. A detailed discussion of the completeness of the data and the biases in the recovered parameters is included in Ferrarese et al. (submitted). Second, four NGVS team members (LF, PAD, PD, and FB) independently inspected the central four square degrees of the PP region and identified, by eye, all objects that appeared to be bona-fide Virgo members; again with few exceptions all such galaxies were detected and correctly identified as bona-fide Virgo members by the code. We stress here that the proximity of the Virgo cluster, together with the remarkable tightness of galaxy scaling relations even at these faint luminosities, are key in providing a clean separation between cluster members and background galaxies even in the absence of spectroscopic information [\citep=Michard2008] [\citep=Rines2008].

Figure [\ref=fig:cmd] (top) presents the (g - i) color-magnitude diagram of all 404 candidate Virgo galaxies in the PP area (except M87). As expected given that we cover the inner regions of the cluster, the great majority of objects fall on a well-defined red sequence all the way down to the faintest luminosities probed [\citep=rsj2008] [\citep=Boselli2014a]. In this work we focus on the shapes of faint, low surface brightness, quiescent galaxies, analogous to the dSph satellites in the LG. It is now well established that this label encompasses objects with quite varied star formation histories [\citep=Weisz2014a]. Throughout this work we keep this terminology when referring to LG satellites for historic reasons, but we will avoid it as much as possible when referring to faint, quiescent Virgo galaxies. Because detailed star formation histories are not available yet for Virgo galaxies of these low masses, we construct our sample of quiescent objects from galaxies with colors consistent with being red-sequence cluster members (see the shaded region in the top panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:cmd]). The lower boundary is set at 0.25 mag below the best-fit color-magnitude relation, whereas (g - i) = 1.1 defines the red end of our selection function . Furthermore, we only select objects in the - 14  ≤  Mg  ≤   - 8 mag range.  With this luminosity cut we guarantee our galaxies to be genuinely faint systems; we match the luminosity range of other low-luminosity samples in the LG and in the Local Universe that will serve as comparison; and we probe a yet unexplored galaxy mass range in Virgo-or any other cluster, for that matter.

We also explored a visual morphological classification with the aid of composite giz color images and unsharp-masked g-band frames. Faint quiescent systems were defined as objects with no evident star formation activity and smooth, elliptical appearances. We found that both the color and morphological classifications produced very similar samples, and therefore our results do not strongly depend on the exact definition of what is a quiescent low-mass galaxy. In the following analysis we use the color selection simply because it results in a more quantitative and reproducible selection function.

Measurements of apparent axis ratios

Structural parameters for low-luminosity galaxies in the NGVS are obtained from both surface brightness profiles using the iraf task ellipse [\citep=Jed1987], and two-dimensional model fits using galfit. The derived structural parameters include, but are not limited to, the effective radius and surface brightness, the Sérsic shape parameter, the position angle, and the apparent axis ratio q-which is the most relevant quantity for this study.  Here we will only use structural parameters derived in the g-band, as it is the band with the highest signal-to-noise ratio in the NGVS. We have verified that our results do not change if we use either the r- or the i-band data. This is expected if these faint systems, like the dSphs in the LG, have relatively uniform stellar populations, and little obscuration caused by dust.

In both approaches the galaxy body is modeled with a [\citet=Sersic1968] function, but only in the case of the isophotal analysis with ellipse is the ellipticity allowed to vary with radius- galfit uses constant axis ratio models. If necessary, a central nuclear component is included in the fits. With typical half-light radii rh  <  0.3 arcsec at the distance of Virgo [\citep=Cote2006] [\citep=Turner2012], most of these nuclei remain unresolved in the NGVS images. They are simply modelled as PSF components [\citep=denBrok2014]. Finally, all the parameters derived from galfit fits are seeing-deconvolved, while ellipse measures seeing-convolved axis ratios. Once again, this should not impact the global structural parameters of objects that have shallow surface brightness profiles and are well resolved. For reference, the smallest effective radius for an Mg  ≈   - 8 Virgo galaxy in our sample is re  ≈  2.5 arcsec ([formula] pc), which is more than a factor three larger than the g-band FWHM.

In this work we use the galfit axis ratios for a practical reason. For a non-negligible fraction of the faintest galaxies, the ellipse fits do not converge when all parameters are allowed to vary due to a combination of small apparent ellipticity and very low central surface brightness. For these objects the fits were carried out with the axis ratio fixed at q = 0.95. Using the ellipse parameters would create an artificial peak in the distribution of observed axis ratios at this value, and would prevent us from modeling it appropriately (see Sect. [\ref=sect:method]).

The observed distribution of galfit axis ratios for our faint Virgo galaxies is plotted as a function of g-band absolute magnitude in the bottom panel of Figure [\ref=fig:cmd]. It is interesting to note the paucity of low-luminosity systems in the core of Virgo displaying highly elongated shapes: 95 per cent of the population have [formula]. This is an important result considering we are only sampling objects with projected distances [formula] kpc from M87, that is, the highest density regions of the cluster where tidal forces are maximized. Additionally, and at least in this mass regime and cluster region, there does not seem to be any dependence of the apparent shapes q on luminosity or clustercentric distance. This guarantees that we can use the entire sample to infer the intrinsic shape of the population. Figure [\ref=fig:pstamps] shows negative postage stamps of six representative galaxies in the PP region, illustrating the range of luminosities and apparent shapes of this faint population, and the quality of the NGVS imaging.

Low-luminosity galaxies in Virgo have flat ellipticity profiles

Accuracy of the axis ratio measurements

Assessing the reliability of the axis ratio measurements for galaxies of such low central surface brightness is of paramount importance for this study, and we have carried out several consistency checks. First, as we have already mentioned, we simulated and added 36,500 single-Sérsic model galaxies to the images, sampling a range in structural parameters. The galaxy models are added to real NGVS frames after being convolved with the appropriate PSF for that randomly selected image location, and the simulated galaxy is fitted with galfit in the same way the real Virgo galaxies are. Figure [\ref=fig:axrat_err] shows the difference between recovered and input axis ratios for the simulated galaxies as a function of their true mean effective surface brightness (left panel), and their true axis ratio (right panel). The grey scale shows the density of galaxies in bins of constant <   μ   >  e,in or qin, with the solid line indicating the median offset. The long-dashed and short-dashed lines enclose 68 and 95 per cent of the data. It is clear that the axis ratios are very robustly determined down to mean effective surface brightnesses as low as <   μ   >  e    ≈  28 mag arcsec- 2, displaying no biases and a maximum 1 σ error ≈  0.1. At fixed <   μ   >  e the error distribution is reasonably well described by a normal function. The right panel shows that the error distribution as a function of input axis ratio is highly peaked around zero. The bias toward recovering smaller axis ratios for larger qin is only a natural consequence of the limitation that, by definition, q  ≤  1. This is an often neglected but important bias, and in Sect. [\ref=sect:bayes] we will discuss how to properly account for it in the analysis.

The uncertainties in q derived from these simulations can be regarded as lower limits only, in the sense that both the PSF and the galaxy light profile are perfectly described by the fitting functions, and the ellipticity is radially constant by construction. To obtain a better understanding of the amplitude of the measurement uncertainties, in Fig. [\ref=fig:axrat_comparison] we compare the axis ratios from the ellipse fits with those derived from the galfit models for the NGVS galaxies. The former measurements correspond to the mean q in the 1  ≤  r / re  ≤  2 range. The left and right panels in Fig. [\ref=fig:axrat_comparison] show the axis ratio difference as a function of the galfit  <   μ   >  e and q, respectively.

It is thus clear that the axis ratios for these faint Virgo galaxies are robustly determined irrespective of both the mean effective surface brightness and the apparent ellipticity of the galaxy.

Galaxy detection rate as a function of axis ratio and surface brightness

Bayesian inference of intrinsic shapes

A family of triaxial galaxy models

The ultimate goal of this study is to derive the underlying distribution of intrinsic shapes for faint galaxies in the Virgo cluster. While, strictly, full shape information for individual objects can only be derived by a combination of structural and kinematical data [\citep=Franx1991] [\citep=statler1994] [\citep=vandenbosch2009], it is still possible to constrain the intrinsic shapes of a given population through the observed distribution of apparent axis ratios and a model for their three-dimensional shape. In the most general case, galaxies with similar elliptical isophotes are best described by triaxial models [\citep=Binney1978]. One can then try to invert the distribution of apparent axis ratios to infer the distribution of intrinsic shapes [\citep=Lambas1992] [\citep=Lisker2007] [\citep=Weijmans2014], but this deprojection problem has no unique solution unless some degree of axisymmetry is assumed-e.g., that the spheroids are either purely oblate, or purely prolate systems [\citep=Fall1983]. Alternatively, one can try to reproduce the observed distribution of apparent axis ratios by varying the triaxial model parameters, and assuming the galaxies are randomly oriented on the sky [\citep=Hubble1926] [\citep=Sandage1970] [\citep=Lambas1992] [\citep=Ryden1994] [\citep=Sung1998] [\citep=Vincent2005]. This is the approach we follow in this work.

We model faint galaxies in Virgo as a family of optically thin triaxial ellipsoids. Following [\citet=Franx1991], we assume that the three-dimensional galaxy density is structured as a set of coaligned ellipsoids characterized by a common ellipticity E  =  1  -  C / A, and a triaxiality T  =  (A2  -  B2) / (A2 - C2), where A  ≥  B  ≥  C are the intrinsic major, intermediate, and minor axis of the ellipsoid, respectively. Special cases of this model include the previously mentioned oblate (B = A, or T = 0) and prolate (C = B, or T = 1) spheroids. More general cases include the oblate-triaxial (C / B  <  B / A) and prolate-triaxial (C / B  >  B / A) spheroids. In our modeling we further assume that the ellipticity and triaxiality parameters for our galaxy population are normally distributed [\citep=Lambas1992] [\citep=Ryden1994] [\citep=Ryden2006] [\citep=Holden2012], with means and standard deviations [formula], σE, [formula], and σT, respectively. Given values for the distributions of intrinsic axis ratios and random viewing angles for each model galaxy, one can easily compute the distribution of apparent axis ratios q [\citep=Stark1977] [\citep=Binney1985].

Figure [\ref=fig:bapdfs_ex] shows three examples of apparent axis ratio distributions constructed from these ellipsoidal models for nearly oblate, nearly prolate, and triaxial families. In this example all models share a common mean intrinsic ellipticity [formula] = 0.6, as well as the same narrow dispersions of ellipticities and triaxialities, namely σE = σT = 0.05. The three models only differ in the mean triaxiality of the population, which takes values of [formula] = 0.01, 0.5, and 0.99 for the oblate, triaxial, and prolate families, respectively. Fig. [\ref=fig:bapdfs_ex] illustrates the dramatic impact that this difference makes in the distribution of projected axis ratios, especially at high q. While all three populations exhibit a peak around q  =  1  -  ε  ~  0.4 (associated with the intrinsic mean ellipticity [formula] =  1 - C / A = 0.6), the relative number of apparently round objects progressively decreases as a function of [formula]. This is because the location of the secondary peak in the observed distribution of q is essentially determined by the mean B / A. A relative paucity of nearly round projected shapes is a generic feature of families of triaxial and prolate ellipsoids.

These apparent axis ratio distributions are equivalent to the likelihood of observing a given axis ratio given the model parameters, and we use this likelihood function to infer the intrinsic shape of low-luminosity galaxies using Bayesian statistics.

Bayesian analysis

Given some data D that we want to describe by a model with parameters [formula], for which we have some prior information I, Bayes' theorem states that:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the posterior probability density function (pdf) of the parameters [formula] given the data D and prior information I; [formula] is the likelihood function; [formula] is the prior joint probability of the model parameters in the absence of data; and p(D|I) is the marginal probability, i.e., the a priori probability of having the data marginalized over all possible parameters. In our particular case, D consists of the observed projected axis ratios for each individual galaxy, qi; the model parameters are [formula] {[formula], σE, [formula], σT}; and the likelihood of apparent axis ratios is calculated as explained in Section [\ref=sect:models]. This approach has several formal and practical advantages. First, it does not require binning but works directly with discrete data, thus preserving the full information content of the dataset. This is always advantageous, but generally not mandatory when the inference is done on large samples of several thousand, or even hundreds of thousand objects [\citep=Ryden2004] [\citep=Holden2012]. However, the analysis on discrete data becomes really powerful when the sample size is relatively small. Choosing the optimal binning in these cases is not trivial, it always smears the underlying signal to a certain degree, and statistical uncertainties become non-Gaussian when the bins contain few objects.

In practice, in our Bayesian approach each distribution of axis ratios predicted by the models is convolved with another distribution representing the individual axis ratio qi and its uncertainty. This is particularly useful when working with non-uniform and/or non-Gaussian uncertainties, or when the full probability distribution for the measurement of each individual axis ratio is available (e.g., [\citealt=Martin2008]). For the very same reason, it is also straightforward to include the effects of biased measurements, and/or to account for lower or upper limits in the measured axis ratios-e.g. we only know our galaxy has q  >  0.9. In this work we model the observed axis ratios as truncated normal distributions with means in the q∈[0,1] interval, and dispersions that are dependent on each galaxy's mean surface brightness, as discussed in Section [\ref=sect:reliability]. This naturally reproduces the bias towards lower recovered axis ratios at high true q also discussed in that Section. The excess probability from a regular normal distribution at q  >  1 (which is non-physical) gets redistributed towards q  ≤  1 values, creating a more extended tail that accounts for the fact that we tend to recover flatter shape measurements due to the bounded nature of axis ratios (see Fig. [\ref=fig:axrat_err]).

In order to efficiently sample the posterior distribution of our parameters [formula] we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In particular, we use the affine-invariant MCMC algorithm implemented in the Python emcee package [\citep=ForemanMackey2013]. We use a set of 100 'walkers' that explore the parameter space at each of the 1000 steps we run. The MCMC chain converges to an equilibrium distribution after approximately 200 'burn-in' steps, which we discard when exploring the posterior distributions.

The intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity Virgo galaxies

Figure [\ref=fig:ngvs_posterior] shows the MCMC posterior distributions for [formula], σE, [formula], and σT for our sample of faint satellites in Virgo. The panels on the diagonal show the marginalized posteriors for each parameter, and the dotted lines indicate the corresponding 2.5, 16, 50, 84 and 97.5 percentiles. The non-diagonal panels correspond to the joint posterior pdfs, and contours in these panels enclose the regions that contain 68 and 95 per cent of the cumulative posterior probability. There are several interesting results worth discussing in detail. First, the distribution of intrinsic ellipticities is well constrained by the data, with median and 68 per cent confidence values [formula] =  0.43+ 0.02- 0.02, and σE =  0.11+ 0.02- 0.01. The inferred triaxiality distribution of the population is [formula] =  0.16+ 0.07- 0.06 and σT =  0.04+ 0.12- 0.03. It is clear that the triaxiality distribution is not well constrained with photometric data alone, something known since the early work from [\citet=Binggeli1980]. Nevertheless, the data clearly favor nearly oblate models over nearly prolate ones, although in any case some degree of triaxiality seems to be required. This is best appreciated in the marginalized posterior panel for [formula]: the maximum of the distribution is clearly different from zero, but fully triaxial and prolate shapes ([formula] [formula]) are essentially ruled out by the data.

Figure [\ref=fig:ngvs_fit] shows in grey a gaussian kernel density estimate of the observed axis ratio distribution. Each galaxy is represented by a truncated gaussian located at the corresponding measured qi, and a with dispersion determined by its mean surface brightness (see Sect. [\ref=sect:reliability]). Thin lines correspond to 100 random samples from the MCMC chain, and the thick solid line indicates the model corresponding to the median of the samples in the marginalized distributions. For reference, the median estimates for [formula] and [formula] correspond to a triaxial ellipsoid with intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57-or, alternatively, it implies that faint Virgo galaxies are nearly oblate, thick spheroids.

We finally note that the models we are using implicitly assume that any obscuration by dust is independent of the viewing angle. This is a reasonable assumption, as we expect quiescent galaxies of these low masses to be optically thin systems with negligible amounts of dust [\citep=deLooze2010] [\citep=Boselli2014]. This is true for any low-mass, quiescent galaxy, but more so for these objects in the core of Virgo, where the stripping of the gas and dust components by ram-pressure from the intracluster medium occurs on short timescales [\citep=Boselli2008].

Comparison with other galaxy samples and simulations

Comparison with luminous early-type galaxies

Comparison with luminous dEs in Virgo

The first statistical study on the intrinsic flattening of Virgo quiescent galaxies was carried out by [\citet=Ichikawa1989] using a sample of nearly one hundred galaxies in the - 17  <  MB  <   - 13 magnitude range. This early study already showed that Virgo dEs are best described as a population of nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic thickness ≈    0.6. [\citet=Ryden1994] modeled the intrinsic distribution of axis ratios for a sample of 70 Virgo dEs in the [formula] mag range. They found mean intermediate-to-major and minor-to-major axis ratios of B / A  =  0.95 and C / A  =  0.54, respectively. These values are remarkably similar to ours for the fainter population; dEs in their sample also are thick, nearly oblate spheroids. We however note that the subclass of bright nucleated dEs was found to be significantly rounder (C / A  =  0.88) than the non-nucleated dEs (C / A  =  0.45; see also [\citealt=Ferguson1989]). Here we do not attempt such separation, but it will be explored in a future paper in this series where we extend the analysis to the entire Virgo cluster-hence improving the statistics.

More recently, [\citet=Lisker2007] studied a much larger sample of ~  400 Virgo dEs as faint as MB  =   - 13 mag using SDSS imaging data. They inferred the intrinsic axis ratio distribution by inverting the observed q distributions under the assumption that the population is either purely oblate, or purely prolate. They also distinguished between nucleated and non-nucleated systems and, like [\citet=Ryden1994] before, found that the latter are significantly flatter than the former. In both cases, though, oblate shapes are favored over prolate ones. For the class of nucleated dEs they found a wide distribution of intrinsic thickness, ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 irrespective of luminosity. They found even more flattened shapes for dEs that show evidence for the presence of spiral arms or residual star formation, suggesting that these systems are probably disky in nature [\citep=Aguerri2005].

Comparison with Local Group satellites

The Local Group provides a natural comparison sample, because its satellite system comprises objects of similar intrinsic physical properties-e.g., luminosity, gas content, or current star formation rate-to those in Virgo. While low number statistics made the task of deriving the intrinsic shapes of LG satellites almost insurmountable in the past, the advent of large panoramic surveys in the last decade has boosted the number of known satellites around both the MW (e.g., [\citealt=Koposov2008]), and M31 [\citep=Richardson2011].

We carry out an investigation on the intrinsic shapes of LG satellites using the machinery developed in Sect. [\ref=sect:method]. We use the structural information for low-luminosity galaxies in the nearby Universe compiled by [\citet=McConnachie2012]. In order to select a sample of LG satellites comparable to the ones in Virgo, we introduce a series of cuts. First, we limit the sample to actual LG satellites by selecting only low-luminosity galaxies within the zero-velocity surface of the LG (see fig. 5 and discussion in [\citealt=McConnachie2012]). Second, we select 'classical' satellites having - 14  ≤  MV  ≤   - 8 mag, thus matching our luminosity range for Virgo systems. Note that restricting the analysis to that luminosity interval is further justified given the claimed discontinuity in apparent dSph shapes below MV  ≈   - 7.5 [\citep=Martin2008]. Finally, we discard all systems with M[formula]. By limiting our sample to objects with low gas mass fractions-or, equivalently, little current star formation activity [\citep=Weisz2011]-we better mimic our selection of red-sequence faint cluster galaxies. Satellites with a significant neutral gas component can have different intrinsic shapes than their gas-poor counterparts [\citep=Roychowdhury2013], which is natural in a scenario where young stars form within the highest density regions of a kinematically cold H  i disk. With this cut we avoid potential biases in our analysis, and it results in a final sample of 23 LG satellites. By combining galaxies from both M31 and the MW, we mitigate to some degree the potential complications arising from observing the latter population from a preferred viewing angle [\citep=Barber2015]. The axis ratio measurements for most M31 satellites come from the homogeneous statistical analysis by Martin et al. (2015). For the remaining galaxies, we use the q values and uncertainties as compiled by [\citet=McConnachie2012].

Figure [\ref=fig:lg_posterior] shows the MCMC posterior distributions for [formula], σE, [formula], and σT for the final sample of 23 LG satellites. It is immediately clear that the much smaller sample size translates into poorer constraints on their intrinsic shapes compared to the Virgo sample. Nevertheless, the intrinsic ellipticity is relatively well constrained, and the mean and dispersion of the population distribution are remarkably similar to those of faint Virgo galaxies: [formula] =  0.51+ 0.07- 0.06 and σE =  0.12+ 0.06- 0.05, respectively. The intrinsic triaxiality of the LG population, however, is significantly different from that of the Virgo sample. LG satellites are best reproduced by triaxial models ([formula] =  0.55+ 0.21- 0.22).

The difference in mean triaxiality between the LG and Virgo low-mass galaxies can be readily understood with the help of Fig. [\ref=fig:lg_fit]. As before, the grey area shows a kde estimate of the observed axis ratios in the LG. Thin lines again correspond to 100 random samples from the MCMC chain, and the thick solid line indicates the model corresponding to the median of the samples in the marginalized distributions. The relevant feature of this figure is the marked paucity of objects with very round apparent shapes. As discussed in Sect. [\ref=sect:models] and illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:bapdfs_ex], this is a characteristic of intrinsically triaxial or prolate populations, simply because random projections on the sky of these objects rarely result in perfectly circular shapes.

The inferred mean values for the model distributions correspond to a triaxial ellipsoid with intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.76:0.49.

[\citet=Martin2008] presented a comprehensive analysis of the structural properties of faint satellites around the MW, including their apparent ellipticities. They found that objects in the [formula] magnitude range (essentially the very same ones used here) have relatively round shapes, with a mean observed q  ≈  0.7 (compare with the peak of the observed distribution in Fig. [\ref=fig:lg_fit]). Remarkably, there seems to be a transition in galaxy shape around this luminosity, as fainter systems have more elongated shapes (mean [formula]), and a broader distribution of apparent axis ratios. They explore several possibilities for the origin of these very elongated shapes, including flattening by rotation, a more elongated shape of their dark matter halos, and tidal distortions. They argue that the latter scenario-that tidal interactions with the MW drive dSph shapes-is slightly preferred over the other mechanisms, and suggest that the broad distribution of observed ellipticities ([formula]) may correspond to different stages in the disruption process (cf. Sect. [\ref=sect:sims]).

It would be extremely interesting to test the disruption hypothesis in the case of extremely faint Virgo galaxies because they reside in a much more dense environment than the MW, and have done so for longer times. Recently, [\citet=Jang2014] reported the serendipitous discovery of a candidate ultra-faint (MV  ≈   - 6.5) galaxy in very deep HST/ACS images of the Virgo cluster. The fact that the apparent ellipticity of this one object is much lower (ε  ≈  0.1) than what is generally found in the LG opens up the exciting possibility that these ultra-faint systems have different intrinsic shapes in groups and clusters. This is admittedly pure speculation, as one single object hardly constrains the intrinsic shape of a population. But, unfortunately, relatively large samples of such galaxies in this very low-mass regime will remain inaccessible in Virgo for years to come.

Comparison with numerical simulations of tidal evolution for satellites

Tidal interactions between a satellite and its host, as well as with other subhalos, are essentially inevitable during their orbital evolution. Numerical simulations show that tidal stripping and shocking generally result in significant mass loss from the dark matter halo [\citep=Gnedin2003] [\citep=Penarrubia2008] [\citep=Smith2013]. Depending on the strength and duration of the interaction, and on the properties of the progenitor galaxy, tidal effects can also drive significant morphological transformation, redistribution of the stellar orbits, and even inflict stellar mass losses.

An even more dramatic transformation, in terms of both mass loss and redistribution of stellar orbits, can occur if the progenitor galaxy is a dynamically cold disk. In this case, the cumulative effects of tidal stripping, tidal shocking, and resonant stripping result in the creation of a lower mass, spheroidal-like system [\citep=Moore1996] [\citep=Moore1998] [\citep=Mayer2001] [\citep=Mastropietro2005] [\citep=DOnghia2009] [\citep=Smith2010] [\citep=Kazantzidis2011]. Naturally, these mechanisms have been invoked to account for the morphology-density relation in both galaxy-sized and cluster-sized halos.

In Figure [\ref=fig:sims] we compare the intrinsic shapes of faint galaxies in the LG and Virgo inferred in the present work with the predictions from two sets of numerical simulations of tidally transformed disks. For the comparison with the LG satellites we use the set of simulations from [\citet=Lokas2012], who follow 10 Gyr of orbital evolution of a galaxy with initial stellar mass [formula] within an MW-sized halo. The final intrinsic ellipticity and triaxiality of the remnants is shown with round symbols in Fig. [\ref=fig:sims] (left panel). The shaded region corresponds to 1000 random bivariate normals from the MCMC chain for the model parameters of LG satellites (Sect. [\ref=sect:lg_shapes]). The dashed line marks the transition between prolate-triaxial and oblate-triaxial spheroids. There is reasonably good agreement between the data and the simulations, with the majority of the simulated remnants being oblate-triaxial spheroids with moderate to small intrinsic ellipticities. The three simulated galaxies with the roundest shapes-which are the most tidally stripped systems-are the least consistent with the distribution of intrinsic shapes inferred in this work. It is however important to note that, in their set of simulations, [\citet=Lokas2012] vary not only the orbital parameters of the satellite, but also their overall stellar and dark matter halo properties (including the initial stellar thickness and mass, and the dark halo concentration, spin, and mass). Their simulations can only be interpreted as being representative of the range of shapes one can expect from the evolution under the tidal stirring scenario, and never as predicting a full distribution of realistic shapes. As discussed before, the paucity of observed LG satellites with very round apparent shapes strongly suggests that the population must have a certain degree of intrinsic triaxiality.

We compare the intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity Virgo galaxies with the set of simulations from [\citet=Mastropietro2005]. These authors follow the evolution of a Large Magellanic Cloud-type disk galaxy infalling into a Virgo-sized halo at z = 0.5. Their simulated galaxies undergo significant mass loss and morphological evolution, and their final intrinsic shapes are shown in the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:sims]. It is clear that the remnants from this set of simulations do not resemble the population of faint galaxies in the core of Virgo: they are both too flattened and too prolate compared to the inferred intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in the NGVS. We note that in Fig. [\ref=fig:sims] we only include the simulated remnants that by z = 0 have experienced at least one orbit with a pericentre bringing them within the virial radius.

However, this striking difference is probably just a limitation of using this particular set of simulations for the comparison. The galaxies simulated by M05 are initially too massive to be the progenitors of the faint Virgo galaxies in our sample: even their most heavily stripped remnant has a final stellar mass at z = 0 roughly seven times larger than our most massive object. This relatively high initial mass (M[formula] M[formula]) also implies a high disk self gravity, which coupled to a very thin and cold initial configuration makes the galaxy rather bar-unstable. Indeed, the severe morphological transformation experienced by the galaxy in these simulations is essentially driven by the formation of a strong bar in the early stages of its tidal evolution. The low surface density material remaining around the bar is subsequently easily stripped by tidal forces, leaving behind a prolate-triaxial stellar body (essentially, a naked bar). The bar usually buckles, and the system becomes progressively rounder as additional tidal interactions and heating occur.

It is important to note that the model galaxy in M05 is so bar-unstable that all of their twenty simulated galaxies form a bar at some point during their evolution-including all of the less-perturbed galaxies that do not even penetrate the cluster virial radius during their orbital evolution (see their table 1, and the discussion in section 3 of that paper). This is probably unrealistic. While it is true that the bar fraction in the field peaks at about 50 per cent around a stellar mass M[formula] M[formula], only one out of five Virgo disk galaxies are barred in this stellar mass regime-and the bar fraction quickly drops to zero at even lower masses [\citep=Mendez-Abreu2010] [\citep=Mendez-Abreu2012]. This suggests that bar-driven evolution due to tidal interactions in the cluster environment is less important than these simulations predict. This scenario is fully consistent with the lack of prolate, bar-like satellites in Virgo.

It is possible that the apparent discrepancy between the inferred intrinsic shapes of faint Virgo galaxies and those predicted by numerical simulations of tidal interactions can be reconciled simply by simulating more adequate models for their progenitor galaxies. For instance, it is clear now that 'central' (as opposed to satellite) galaxies with masses M[formula] M[formula] are not thin disks, but rather thick oblate spheroids [\citep=rsj2010] [\citep=Roychowdhury2013] in which pressure support is dominant [\citep=Wheeler2015]. Additionally, [\citet=Kazantzidis2011] show that tidal shocks heat the stellar body more effectively in lower mass systems, and as a result the remnants evolve into more spherical shapes. In any case, and to our best knowledge, no simulations have yet studied the tidal evolution of galaxies in the low luminosity regime explored in this work within a Virgo-like environment.

Comparison with low-luminosity, star-forming galaxies in the field

Finally, our results can also be compared with the intrinsic shape of faint star-forming galaxies, i.e., similar mass objects residing in lower density environments and having later-type morphologies and measurable star formation rates. [\citet=Sung1998] already noted that faint star-forming galaxies do not conform to the belief that they are highly flattened systems; much on the contrary, they actually are relatively puffy objects. [\citet=rsj2010] later showed that, under the assumption that low-mass galaxies are well described as oblate spheroids, their thickness systematically increases towards fainter luminosities. They argued this trend to be an intrinsic property-faint galaxies in their sample are mostly centrals, not satellites-related to the complex interplay between mass, specific angular momentum, and stellar feedback effects. Simply put, the increasing importance of turbulent motions over rotational support in lower mass galaxies leads to the formation of thicker systems [\citep=Kaufmann2007]. The recent kinematical analysis of low-mass galaxies in the Local Volume by [\citet=Wheeler2015] provides strong support for this scenario. These authors find that the great majority of M[formula] M[formula] galaxies, regardless of whether they are isolated or satellites, are pression-supported.

A more quantitative comparison with the results presented here can be made by using the recent analysis of [\citet=Roychowdhury2013]. They follow a similar approach to ours to derive the intrinsic shapes of a sample of several hundred star-forming faint galaxies in the Local Volume. These authors find the same trend as [\citet=rsj2010], namely that fainter star-forming systems are systematically rounder. Their lowest-luminosity subsample ([formula] mag) is a reasonably good match to the luminosities of the faint Virgo systems studied in this work. These nearby dIrrs are best described by a family of oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic ellipticity [formula]   =  0.52. This is again a very similar value-though implying slightly flatter shapes-to the one we derive here for both Virgo and, especially, LG quiescent galaxies of the same luminosity. This finding strongly indicates that, to first order, the mechanisms shaping the structure of these low-mass systems are almost independent of the present local environment. If the progenitors of low-luminosity Virgo galaxies did have shapes similar to present-day faint dIrrs-an assumption that does not necessarily have to hold-then the environmental effects that transformed them into non-star forming galaxies have resulted in a relatively small amount of thickening of their stellar bodies.

Summary and conclusions

We have investigated the intrinsic shapes of faint, red-sequence galaxies in the central 300 kpc of the Virgo cluster using deep imaging obtained as part of the NGVS. We have built a sample of nearly 300 red-sequence cluster members in the - 14  <  Mg  <   - 8 magnitude range, and we measure their apparent axis ratios through Sérsic fits to their two-dimensional light distribution in the g-band. The resulting distribution of apparent axis ratios is then fit by a family of triaxial models with normally-distributed intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities. We develop a Bayesian framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model parameters. This approach allows us to work directly on discrete data (i.e., without binning), as well as to account for individual, surface brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties.

We find that faint galaxies in the core of Virgo are best described as thick, nearly oblate spheroids, with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57. Using the machinery developed for this investigation, we additionally carry out a study of the intrinsic shapes of satellites of similar luminosities in the Local Group. For this population we infer a slightly larger mean intrinsic ellipticity, but the lack of objects with round appearances translates into more triaxial shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We compare these results with numerical simulations that follow the tidal evolution of satellites within cluster- and group-sized halos. The LG simulations generally match the inferred distribution of dSph intrinsic shapes, but the remnants simulated in the cluster environment are both too flattened and too prolate compared to observed faint Virgo galaxies. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, and conclude that more adequate simulations of cluster galaxies in the luminosity regime explored in this work are needed in order to compare with the observations.

We finally compare the intrinsic shapes of the NGVS low-luminosity galaxies with samples of more massive, quiescent cluster systems, and with star-forming galaxies of similar luminosities residing in lower-density environments. Remarkably, all these low-mass galaxy samples are also best described as thick, nearly oblate spheroids, and their intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities are consistent, within the uncertainties, with those inferred for the faint Virgo population. This is an important result, as it implies that, to first order, intrinsic shapes in this luminosity regime are largely independent of the environment in which the galaxy resides.

There is, however, a hint that cluster objects may be slightly thicker than group satellites, which are not different from more isolated faint galaxies. Indeed, the mean thickness of the low-luminosity population is C / A  =  0.57,0.49, and 0.48 for objects in Virgo, in the LG, and in the field, respectively. The fact that low-mass galaxies that have a priori experienced very different degrees of environmental effects have very similar flattenings seems to suggest that internal-and not external-mechanisms are the main drivers of galaxy structure in this luminosity regime. This may be the case if, for example, galaxies of these masses already form as thick, puffy systems due to baryonic processes that act to pressurize gas within low-mass halos. These processes may include photoionization from the cosmic UV background, and star formation feedback [\citep=Kaufmann2007] [\citep=Teyssier2013]. Alternatively, other sources of internal heating, such as dynamical interactions with dark subhalos may play a role as well [\citep=Starkenburg2015]. Subsequent gas stripping and tidal evolution within their host halos-especially if acting early on-certainly can contribute to some degree to the heating of the stellar body of satellites, making them progressively thicker. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that these systems were already formed with the observed distributions of intrinsic flattenings.

We will explore this scenario in more detail in a future paper of this series using an extended sample of several thousand faint NGVS galaxies across the entire Virgo cluster, for which we are currently deriving structural parameters and establishing robust membership. With increased statistics we will be able to investigate intrinsic shapes as a function of mass, color, and location in position-velocity phase-space, thus addressing the interplay between internal and external processes in shaping the structure of low-luminosity galaxies.
