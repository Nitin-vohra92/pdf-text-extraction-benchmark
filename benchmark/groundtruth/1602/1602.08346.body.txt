The number of roots of full support

Introduction

Let Φ be an irreducible crystallographic root system of rank n with ambient space V, Coxeter number h and exponents [formula]. Fix a set of positive roots Φ+ for it and let [formula] be the corresponding set of simple roots. Let [formula] be the set of simple reflections and let W = 〈S〉 be the Weyl group of Φ. See [\cite=humphreys90reflection] for background on root systems and Weyl groups. Any positive root β∈Φ+ can be written as linear combination of simple roots

[formula]

where the coefficients cβα are nonnegative integers. Define the support of β as the set of those simple roots whose coefficient is nonzero:

[formula]

The aim of this note is to give a uniform proof of the following statement, observed case-by-case by Chapoton.

The number of positive roots in Φ+ whose support is Δ is given by the formula

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

Define a partial order on the set of positive roots Φ+ by β  ≤  γ if and only if γ  -  β is a linear combination of simple roots with nonnegative coefficients. Call Φ+ with this partial order the root poset.

For a positive root β∈Φ+ define

[formula]

to be the principal order ideal in the root poset generated by β. We have [formula], so the map

[formula]

is a bijection from the set of positive roots whose support is Δ to the set of order ideals that contain Δ and have exactly one maximal element. By a result of Athanasiadis and Tzanaki [\cite=athanasiadis06cluster] the latter set is in bijection with the set of W-orbits on the finite torus [formula] whose stabilizer has rank 1. Here [formula] is the coroot lattice of Φ. Using a result of Sommers [\cite=sommers97family] the number of these orbits is

[formula]

where the sum is over representatives H of the W-orbits of hyperplanes in the Coxeter arrangement of Φ, LH is the intersection lattice of the restriction of the Coxeter arrangement to H and χ(LH,t) is its characteristic polynomial. Using [formula] [\cite=orlik87coxeter] this equals

[formula]

as required. Here we used the duality of exponents h - ei = en + 1 - i and [formula].
