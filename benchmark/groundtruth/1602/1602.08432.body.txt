Spectral Properties and Chiral Symmetry Violations of (staggered) Domain Wall Fermions in the Schwinger Model

Introduction

Chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for the understanding of hadron phenomenology and the low-energy dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). On the lattice, the overlap construction [\cite=Narayanan:1992wx] [\cite=Narayanan:1993ss] [\cite=Narayanan:1993sk] [\cite=Narayanan:1994gw] [\cite=Neuberger:1997fp] [\cite=Neuberger:1998my] [\cite=Neuberger:1998wv] allows one to implement a fermion operator with exact chiral symmetry [\cite=Ginsparg:1981bj] [\cite=Hasenfratz:1998ri] [\cite=Luscher:1998pqa], thus evading the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem [\cite=Nielsen:1980rz] [\cite=Nielsen:1981hk] [\cite=Nielsen:1981xu] [\cite=Friedan:1982nk]. In practice the use of overlap fermions is limited by the fact that they generically require a factor of [formula] more computational resources than Wilson fermions and tunneling between topological sectors is severely suppressed even at moderate lattice spacings [\cite=Egri:2005cx] [\cite=Fukaya:2006vs] [\cite=Cundy:2008zc] [\cite=Cundy:2011fz].

Domain wall fermions [\cite=Kaplan:1992bt] [\cite=Shamir:1993zy] [\cite=Furman:1994ky] offer an alternative by formulating fermions with approximate chiral symmetry in d dimensions by means of massive interacting fermions in d + 1 dimensions (d = 2,4). The limit of an infinite extension of the extra dimension can again be expressed as an overlap operator with exact chiral symmetry. For a finite extent, domain wall fermions can then be seen as a truncation of overlap fermions. They offer the possibility of reducing computational cost and are well suited for parallel implementations. This comes at the price of replacing the exact chiral symmetry by an approximate one. It is expected that chiral symmetry violations are exponentially suppressed [\cite=Shamir:1993zy] [\cite=Vranas:1997da] [\cite=Aoki:1997xg] [\cite=Kikukawa:1997tf], although in practice this suppression can still require large extents of the extra dimension [\cite=Chen:1998xw] [\cite=Blum:1998ud] [\cite=Fleming:1999eq] [\cite=Hernandez:2000iw] [\cite=Aoki:2000pc]. However, these violations also facilitate the tunneling between topological sectors.

Domain wall fermions are typically formulated with a Wilson kernel [\cite=Wilson:1975id]. Only recently has it been clarified by Adams [\cite=Adams:2009eb] [\cite=Adams:2010gx] how to utilize the computationally more efficient staggered fermions [\cite=Kogut:1974ag] [\cite=Banks:1975gq] [\cite=Banks:1976ia] [\cite=Susskind:1976jm] in its place by giving staggered fermions a flavor dependent mass, see also Refs. [\cite=Golterman:1984cy] [\cite=Hoelbling:2010jw] [\cite=SharpeWorkshop]. Subsequent numerical work [\cite=deForcrand:2011ak] [\cite=deForcrand:2012bm] [\cite=Durr:2013gp] [\cite=Adams:2013tya] focused on the properties of these staggered Wilson fermions and their use as a kernel for an overlap construction [\cite=Adams:2010gx]. The possibility of staggered domain wall fermions, which was also suggested in Ref. [\cite=Adams:2010gx], has however not been investigated any further. The present work is meant as a first step in closing this gap. We give explicit constructions of staggered domain wall fermions and compare their spectral and chiral symmetry breaking properties to those of traditional domain wall fermions with Wilson fermions in the context of the Schwinger model [\cite=Schwinger:1962tp].

While we are eventually interested in QCD, the Schwinger model, i.e. [formula]-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), retains enough properties of QCD. In particular we find confinement and topological structure, making it useful for conceptual investigations. On the other hand, it is numerically simple enough to allow the computation of the complete eigenvalue spectrum of fermion operators on nontrivial background configurations. Moreover, the study of fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions naturally arises e.g. in the low-energy description of conducting electrons in metals, cf. Ref. [\cite=tsvelik2007quantum].

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:Kernel-operators] we briefly discuss the kernel operators, among them generalizations of staggered Wilson fermions, in Sec. [\ref=sec:Domain-wall-fermions] the construction of (staggered) domain wall fermions and their variations are given, in Sec. [\ref=sec:Effective-Dirac-operator] we introduce the effective Dirac operators and discuss the limiting overlap operators, in Sec. [\ref=sec:Setting] we explain our approach of carrying out the numerical calculations and in Sec. [\ref=sec:Numerical-results] we finally discuss the numerical results. In Sec. [\ref=sec:Conclusions] we conclude our work and give an outlook.

Kernel operators

We begin by giving a quick review of the kernel operators we are considering, namely Wilson and staggered Wilson fermions. Here and in the following we are mostly interested in the [formula]-dimensional case (d = 2), but where convenient we write down the general d-dimensional expressions.

Wilson kernel

For Wilson fermions [\cite=Wilson:1974sk], the Dirac operator reads

[formula]

Here the γμ-matrices refer to a representation of the Dirac algebra [formula] with [formula], δμ,ν to the Kronecker delta, [formula] to the covariant central finite difference operator and [formula] to the bare fermion mass. The Wilson term reads

[formula]

with lattice spacing a, Wilson parameter [formula] and the covariant lattice Laplacian Δ. We note that [formula], where γd + 1 is the chirality matrix, and that the [formula]-terms breaks chiral symmetry explicitly. In terms of the parallel transport

[formula]

we have the following definitions

[formula]

Through the Wilson term [formula], the doublers acquire a mass [formula]. In the continuum limit the number of flavors is then reduced from 2d to one physical flavor.

Staggered Wilson fermions

Based on the works presented in Refs. [\cite=Golterman:1984cy] [\cite=Adams:2009eb] [\cite=Adams:2010gx] [\cite=Hoelbling:2010jw] [\cite=deForcrand:2012bm] [\cite=Durr:2013gp], we can generalize existing staggered Wilson fermion formulations to arbitrary even dimensions d. We write a single flavor staggered Wilson operator as

[formula]

with staggered Dirac operator

[formula]

and bare fermion mass [formula]. The staggered Wilson term can be written as

[formula]

with Wilson-like parameter r > 0. The operators Γμν and Cμν given by

[formula]

Here and in the following [formula] refers to the Levi-Civita symbol. The determinant of [formula] is real because [formula] with

[formula]

In the spin[formula]flavor interpretation [\cite=Golterman:1984cy], we have up to discretization terms

[formula]

where the ξμ are a representation of the Dirac algebra in flavor space. As a result we find for the staggered Wilson term

[formula]

with [formula]. This implies that the number of physical fermion species of [formula] is reduced to one by giving all but a single flavor a mass [formula].

Note that the mass term given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefGeneralMassTerm] is not unique. Apart from simple index permutations, one might consider more general terms that each split the staggered flavors into two branches with half the number of flavors. For n  ≤  d / 2, these generalizations of Adams' mass term read

[formula]

with

[formula]

and replacing Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefGeneralMassTerm] by a generic

[formula]

where [formula] and the sum is over all multi-indices [formula] with 1  ≤  μi  ≤  d for all i with [formula] .

Note that in the spin[formula]flavor interpretation we find

[formula]

up to discretization terms. Adams' original mass term [\cite=Adams:2009eb] [\cite=Adams:2010gx] in d = 4 dimensions then follows from setting r1234 = r > 0 and [formula] otherwise. Explicitly we then find

[formula]

with η5  =  η1η2η3η4 and [formula].

For the d = 2 case that we will consider in the numerical part of this paper, the definition is essentially unique

[formula]

In this case the reduction is from two staggered flavors to a single physical one.

Like in the Wilson case, all possible [formula]-terms break chiral symmetry explicitly. Furthermore there may be additional counter terms if too many of the staggered symmetries are broken [\cite=SharpeWorkshop].

Domain wall fermions

After having introduced the kernel operators, we now move on to the actual Dirac operators of interest, i.e. domain wall fermions. Originally proposed by Kaplan [\cite=Kaplan:1992bt], then refined by Shamir and Furman [\cite=Shamir:1993zy] [\cite=Furman:1994ky], the domain wall construction implements approximately massless fermions in d dimensions by means of a [formula]-dimensional theory. Equivalently, domain wall fermions can be understood as a tower of Ns fermions in d dimensions with a particular flavor structure.

We now give a quick summary of the well-known [formula]-dimensional formulations. For the remainder of the paper we fix the d-dimensional lattice spacing to a = 1 and the (staggered) Wilson parameter to r = 1.

Standard construction

We begin with the standard construction. First, let us define

[formula]

where we explicitly write out the lattice spacing ad + 1 in the extra dimension. The parameter M0 is the so-called domain wall height and must be suitably chosen for the description of a single flavor. In the free field case we have [formula].

The Dirac operator reads

[formula]

with [formula]-dimensional fermion fields [formula], Ψ and chiral projectors [formula]. Here and in the following the index s refers to the additional spatial (or equivalently flavor) coordinate. The gauge links are taken to be the identity matrix along the additional coordinate. Furthermore, we impose the following boundary conditions

[formula]

where m is related to the bare fermion mass, cf. Eq. [\eqref=eq:InducedMass]. We note that in the special case of m = 0 we find Dirichlet boundary conditions in the extra dimension, while for [formula] one recovers (anti-)periodic boundary conditions. If we write down the Dirac operator in the extra dimension explicitly, we find

[formula]

One possibility of constructing the d-dimensional fermion fields from the boundary is via

[formula]

Let us also define the reflection operator along the extra dimension

[formula]

We find that [formula] is Rγd + 1-Hermitian

[formula]

which ensures that [formula] and the applicability of importance sampling techniques.

Besides this canonical formulation, several variations of domain wall fermions have been proposed.

Boriçi's construction

One of them is the construction by Boriçi [\cite=Borici:1999zw], which follows from the original proposal by the replacements

[formula]

Note that this is an [formula] modification. The Dirac operator in its full form reads

[formula]

or explicitly

[formula]

Furthermore Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefLightFermions] generalizes to

[formula]

and Eq. [\eqref=eq:RGHermiticity] to

[formula]

see Ref. [\cite=Brower:2004xi]. This formulation is also known as "truncated overlap fermions" as the corresponding d-dimensional effective operator equals the polar decomposition approximation [\cite=Neuberger:1998my] [\cite=higham1994matrix] of order Ns / 2 of Neuberger's overlap operator (for even Ns).

Optimal construction

The last modification we consider are the optimal domain wall fermions proposed by Chiu [\cite=Chiu:2002ir] [\cite=Chiu:2002kj]. The idea is to modify [formula] in such a way, that the effective Dirac operator is expressed through Zolotarev's optimal rational approximation of the sign function [\cite=zolotarev1877application] [\cite=akhiezer1990elements] [\cite=achieser2013theory], see also Refs. [\cite=vandenEshof:2002ms] [\cite=Chiu:2002eh]. In the following we quote the central formulas of the construction given in Ref. [\cite=Chiu:2002ir].

Starting from Boriçi's construction, the Dirac operator is modified by introducing weight factors

[formula]

where

[formula]

The weight factors ωs are given by

[formula]

with [formula] being the corresponding Jacobi elliptic function with argument vs and modulus κ'. The modulus is defined by

[formula]

and [formula] ([formula]) is the respective smallest (largest) eigenvalue of [formula] with

[formula]

The argument vs reads

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here [formula] refers to the floor function, [formula] to the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with

[formula]

Furthermore we introduced the elliptic Theta function via

[formula]

with [formula] and elliptic theta functions ϑi [\cite=abramowitz1966handbook]. Some reference values for the weight factors [formula] can be found in App. [\ref=sec:Optimal-weights].

Similarly to Boriçi's construction, Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefLightFermions] now generalizes to

[formula]

and Eq. [\eqref=eq:RGHermiticity] again to Eq. [\eqref=eq:RGHermiticityBorici], but now with

[formula]

as pointed out in Ref. [\cite=Brower:2004xi]. Optimal domain wall fermions have been and are still extensively used. Some of the results obtained can be found in Refs. [\cite=Chen:2011qy] [\cite=Hsieh:2011qx] [\cite=Chiu:2011dz] [\cite=Chiu:2011bm] [\cite=Chen:2012jya] [\cite=Chiu:2012jm].

We also note that there is a modified construction of optimal domain wall fermions [\cite=Chiu:2015sea], which is reflection-symmetric along the fifth dimension. For completeness we point out that all the preceding domain wall fermion formulations can be seen as special cases of Möbius domain wall fermions [\cite=Brower:2004xi] [\cite=Brower:2005qw] [\cite=Brower:2009sb].

Staggered formulations

As proposed in Ref. [\cite=Adams:2010gx], we can use the staggered Wilson kernel to formulate staggered versions of domain wall fermions. In our notation the Dirac operator reads

[formula]

where Υ refers to the [formula]-dimensional staggered fermion field. Like in the Wilson case we define

[formula]

The chiral projectors (note that [formula]) are given by [formula]. The replacement rule to construct [formula] from [formula] given in Ref. [\cite=Adams:2010gx] generalizes to the case of arbitrary flavor splits in [formula] dimensions in a straightforward manner as

[formula]

Note that we follow a sign convention in where our [formula] is in full analogy to [formula], while in Ref. [\cite=Adams:2010gx] a slightly different convention is used.

One can easily verify the Rε-Hermiticity of [formula]. Using Eq. [\eqref=eq:ReplacementRule], we can also generalize Boriçi's and the optimal domain wall fermion construction to the case of a staggered Wilson kernel.

Effective Dirac operator

To understand the relation between the [formula]-dimensional fermions and the light d-dimensional fields q, [formula] at the boundary, we introduce the effective d-dimensional Dirac operator as derived in Refs. [\cite=Neuberger:1997bg] [\cite=Kikukawa:1999sy] [\cite=Kikukawa:1999dk] [\cite=Borici:1999zw] (see also Refs. [\cite=Shamir:1998ww] [\cite=Edwards:2000qv]). In the following we give a short summary, following Refs. [\cite=Kikukawa:1999sy] [\cite=Borici:1999zw] [\cite=Edwards:2000qv].

Derivation

The low energy effective d-dimensional action

[formula]

follows after integrating out the Ns - 1 heavy modes. The effective Dirac operator is defined via the propagator

[formula]

For a suitable choice of M0, there is exactly one light and Ns - 1 heavy Dirac fermions.

In the chiral limit Ns  →    ∞   (at fixed bare coupling β), the contribution from the heavy fermions diverges. This bulk contribution from the [formula]-dimensional fermions can be canceled by the introduction of suitable pseudofermion fields. One typically chooses the fermion action with the replacement [formula] as the action for the pseudofermions.

Let us begin by defining the Hermitian operators

[formula]

where the kernel operator of standard domain wall fermions is given by

[formula]

The transfer matrix along the extra dimension is given by

[formula]

where we use the notation

[formula]

Then the effective operator can be written as

[formula]

Note that we can rewrite Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDeff] as

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the effective operator [formula] at m = 0. We can see that the parameter m induces a bare fermion mass of [formula], cf. Ref. [\cite=Boyle:2016imm].

Alternatively, one can also show [\cite=Borici:1999zw] [\cite=Edwards:2000qv] the relation

[formula]

with the matrix P defined as

[formula]

and [formula]. Here we used the shorthand notation [formula], while the index stands for the [formula] s-block of the matrix.

The derivation of the effective operator for optimal domain wall fermions follows Boriçi's construction after including the weight factors [formula] appropriately [\cite=Chiu:2002ir]. By construction the [formula]-function approximation equals the optimal rational approximation. It can be either evaluated directly or via the projection method of Eq. [\eqref=eq:ProjMethod].

The Ns  →    ∞   limit

In the following let us specialize to m = 0. Note that we can rewrite Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDeff] using

[formula]

where εNs / 2 is Neuberger’s polar decomposition approximation [\cite=Neuberger:1998my] [\cite=higham1994matrix] of the [formula]-function. Therefore we obtain an overlap operator in the Ns  →    ∞   limit as following

[formula]

with H given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefH], [formula] and

[formula]

The overlap operator satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson equation

[formula]

and allows for an exact chiral symmetry. Eq. [\eqref=eq:GWR] also implies the normality of the overlap operator as can be easily verified.

Comparing Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDov] to the standard definition of the overlap operator

[formula]

and using the relation for the effective negative mass parameter

[formula]

we would obtain a restriction on the domain wall height M0 from ρ = 1 / 2. This can be avoided by simply rescaling [formula] by a factor ϱ = 2ρ, so that--up to discretization effects--the low-lying eigenvalues of the kernel remain invariant under the effective operator projection in the free field case. This is also illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:free-dov], which we elaborate on in Sec. [\ref=sub:Free-field-case]. Consequently, we will employ this rescaling in all our numerical investigations.

Approximate sign functions

The effective Dirac operators in the various formulations are given in terms of different [formula] function approximations. Explicitly, these approximations of [formula] read

[formula]

with

[formula]

so that [formula] for Ns  →    ∞  . We illustrate these approximations in Fig. [\ref=fig:sign-approximations], comparing the polar decomposition approximation in Boriçi's construction with the optimal rational function approximation in Chiu's construction. The coefficients [formula] are directly linked to Zolotarev's coefficients, cf. Refs. [\cite=zolotarev1877application] [\cite=vandenEshof:2002ms] [\cite=Chiu:2002eh]. Note that the [formula] function approximation for the standard construction agrees with the one in Boriçi's construction, but is applied to [formula] rather than [formula].

Staggered formulations.

As previously suggested in Ref. [\cite=Adams:2010gx], all central equations in this section generalize to the case of staggered Wilson fermions after the replacements given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:ReplacementRule]. In particular, staggered domain wall fermions can be seen as a truncation of Neuberger's overlap construction with staggered Wilson kernel [\cite=Adams:2010gx].

Setting

In the following we elaborate on the setting of our numerical simulations. In particular we discuss the quantities, which allow us to quantify and compare the chiral properties of the different formulations.

Choice of M0

In the free field case, suitable choices for the domain wall height M0 are in the range 0 < M0 < 2 for a one flavor theory. In a gauge field background, in general this interval contracts. Intuitively, the parameter M0 has to be chosen in such a way, that the origin is shifted sufficiently close to the center of the leftmost "belly" of the eigenvalue spectrum. While there is no unique optimal choice even in the free field case [\cite=Durr:2005an], one can use the canonical choice M0 = 1, which shifts the origin exactly to the center. To be more precise, the mobility edge [\cite=Golterman:2003qe] [\cite=Golterman:2003ui] [\cite=Golterman:2004cy] [\cite=Golterman:2005fe] is the decisive quantity determining valid choices of M0.

In the Schwinger model the interval of valid choices for M0 remains close to the free field case for reasonable values of the inverse coupling β. In particular M0 = 1 remains a sensible and simple choice, which we are consequently using for all numerical work presented. This is in contrast to QCD in 3 + 1 dimensions, where one commonly sets M0 = 1.8, see e.g. Ref. [\cite=Blum:2000kn].

Effective mass

Two common approaches found in the literature to quantify the induced effects of chiral symmetry breaking in domain wall fermions are the determination of the residual mass [formula] [\cite=Furman:1994ky] [\cite=Fleming:1999eq] [\cite=Blum:2000kn] [\cite=Blum:2001sr] and the effective mass [formula] [\cite=Gadiyak:2000kz] [\cite=Jung:2000fh] [\cite=Jung:2000ys]. The former employs the explicit fermion mass dependence in the chiral Ward-Takahashi identities, while the latter is given by the lowest eigenvalue of the Hermitian operator in a topologically nontrivial background field. Although the definitions are not equivalent, their numerical values usually agree within a factor of [formula] and hence both are suitable to quantify the degree of chiral symmetry breaking.

In this work we use the effective mass [formula] due to its conceptual simplicity. We hence define the effective mass for a given Dirac operator D with periodic boundary conditions in a topologically nontrivial background field as the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding Hermitian version H of the Dirac operator. Noting that [formula], we define

[formula]

If D is a normal operator, then [formula]. In the general case, however, there is no direct link between the eigenvalues of H and D.

On a topological nontrivial background configuration with topological charge [formula], the Atiyah-Singer index theorem [\cite=AtiyahI] [\cite=AtiyahIII] [\cite=AtiyahIV] [\cite=AtiyahV] ensures the existence of zero modes of H in the continuum. The corresponding lattice version of this theorem [\cite=Ginsparg:1981bj] [\cite=Hasenfratz:1998ri] [\cite=Luscher:1998pqa] ensures that the overlap operator in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDov] has exact zero modes as well. For domain wall fermions and their respective effective operators these zero modes are recovered in the Ns  →    ∞   limit. For finite Ns, however, these zero modes become approximate and their deviation from zero can serve as a measure for the degree of chiral symmetry breaking.

If n∓ refers to the number of left-handed and right-handed zero modes, then the Atiyah-Singer index theorem states that

[formula]

cf. Ref. [\cite=Adams:2009eb]. A precise definition of Q will be given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefQ]. We note here that in 1 + 1 dimensions the Vanishing Theorem holds [\cite=Kiskis:1977vh] [\cite=Nielsen:1977aw] [\cite=Ansourian:1977qe]. That is, if [formula], then either n- or n+ vanishes.

Normality and Ginsparg-Wilson relation

In the continuum the Dirac operator is normal. The same holds for the naïve and staggered discretizations as well as for the overlap operator. The (staggered) Wilson kernel and the (staggered) domain wall fermion operators, on the other hand, are not normal.

As it has been shown that normality is necessary for chiral properties [\cite=Kerler:1999dk] (see also Refs. [\cite=Hip:2001hc] [\cite=Hip:2001mh]), the degree of violation of normality is an interesting quantity in the context of chiral symmetry.

Let us recall that a normal operator D satisfies [formula] by definition. We then consider the quantity

[formula]

where [formula] is the by the L∞-norm induced matrix norm. We know that [formula] has to vanish for the effective operators introduced in Sec. [\ref=sec:Effective-Dirac-operator] in the limit Ns  →    ∞  .

Similarly, we consider violations of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:GWR]. The quantity

[formula]

has to vanish in the limit Ns  →    ∞   as well. As before, we replace γ3 by ε in the case of a staggered Wilson kernel. As previously already considered in Refs. [\cite=Durr:2005an] [\cite=Durr:2010ch], [formula] and [formula] will give us a measure for the degree of chiral symmetry violation of the Dirac operators under consideration.

Topological charge

We determine the topological charge of the gauge configurations via both the standard overlap definition

[formula]

and its staggered counterpart

[formula]

with [formula] as derived in Ref. [\cite=Adams:2009eb]. On the small sample of gauge configurations considered in this paper, they were found to be in exact agreement. Although a more careful investigation of the continuum limit would be needed, this observation is consistent with analytical results [\cite=Adams:2013lpa] and other numerical studies [\cite=deForcrand:2012bm] [\cite=Azcoiti:2014pfa].

Numerical results

We are now moving to the numerical part of this work. We calculate the complete eigenvalue spectra of all Dirac operators introduced in the previous sections, both with a Wilson and staggered Wilson kernel, for the [formula]-dimensional Schwinger model. We consider the free field case and a small number of gauge configurations from Ref. [\cite=Durr:2004ta].

In all cases we consider a lattice of size [formula] with spacing a = ad + 1 = 1 and Wilson parameter r = 1. The extent in the extra dimension will be varied in the range [formula]. We use periodic boundary conditions in both space and time direction, so that the determination of the effective mass [formula] as defined in Sec. [\ref=sub:Effective-mass] applies.

Extremal eigenvalues are determined with arpack [\cite=Lehoucq97arpackusers], while complete spectra are computed with lapack [\cite=LAPACK]. Calculations are carried out in double precision. In all figures the abbreviation "std" refers to the standard construction, "Bor" to Boriçi's construction and "opt" to Chiu's optimal construction. With respect to the overlap constructions, "DW" refers to the overlap operator with kernel [formula], "Neub" to Neuberger's overlap with kernel [formula] and "Adams" to Adams' staggered overlap with kernel [formula].

Free field case

We begin with the free field case. Here we can employ a momentum space representation of the kernel. In particular the Wilson kernel can be represented as a [formula] linear map

[formula]

where pμ = 2πnμ / Nμ with [formula] and Nμ is the number of slices in μ-direction. The staggered Wilson kernel takes the form of the [formula] linear map

[formula]

with [formula], see also Refs. [\cite=Adams:2013lpa] [\cite=deForcrand:2012bm].

In the three-dimensional operators we keep the extra dimension in the position space formulation, as in general it is lacking periodicity. Besides reducing the dimensionality of the eigenvalue problem by choosing a momentum space representation for the kernel, this also avoids some numerical instabilities of the free field case encountered in a purely position space based formulation.

Kernel operators.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:free-kernel] we can find the well known free spectra of the kernel operators. In 1 + 1 dimensions the Wilson Dirac operator has only two doubler branches in the eigenvalue spectrum due to the reduced number of fermion species in this low-dimensional setting. Like in 3 + 1 dimensions, the staggered Wilson Dirac operator has a single doubler branch due to the splitting of positive and negative flavor-chirality species.

Bulk operators.

In Figs. [\ref=fig:free-wilson-bulk], [\ref=fig:free-stw-bulk] and [\ref=fig:free-wilson-bulk-bcs], we show the spectrum of the [formula]-dimensional bulk operator. First we compare the standard, Boriçi's and the optimal construction to each other. Then we show periodic (m =  - 1) and antiperiodic (m = 1) boundary conditions in the extra dimension to compare with the Dirichlet (m = 0) case.

We can observe that the bulk spectra for Boriçi's and the optimal construction have lost their resemblance to a Wilson operator in three dimensions. Specifically, while for the standard construction we find (two) three doubler branches in the spectrum with the (staggered) Wilson kernel, in Boriçi's construction one less branch is visible.

In the standard and Boriçi's construction, we find 2Ns exact zero modes in the Dirichlet case [\cite=Shamir:1993zy] [\cite=Gadiyak:2000kz], which disappear for [formula]. In the optimal construction, we notice how the corresponding eigenvalues get spread out along the real axis and we are left with only two approximate zero modes.

Effective operators.

We now move on to the effective operators [formula] as defined in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDeff]. In Figs. [\ref=fig:free-deff-Ns2] and [\ref=fig:free-deff-Ns8] we show the respective eigenvalue spectra with a Wilson and staggered Wilson kernel.

As we can see, the spectra approach the Ginsparg-Wilson circle rapidly for increasing values of Ns. This fast convergence is of course expected on smooth configurations like the free field. Already for Ns = 8 the spectrum is close to the spectrum of the corresponding overlap operator in the Ns  →    ∞   limit. In particular we note the rapid convergence of Boriçi's and Chiu's construction with a staggered Wilson kernel.

The effective Dirac operator in the optimal construction shows a significantly improved convergence. Let us recall that the optimal rational function approximation [formula] of the [formula] function minimizes the maximal deviation

[formula]

on a given interval [formula]. As the kernel Dirac operator is normal in the free field case, we observe that all eigenvalues lie within a tube with diameter [formula] around the Ginsparg-Wilson circle. That is, for all eigenvalues λ we find [formula]. Noting that the [formula] function has a point of maximal deviation at both [formula], we observe the absence of an exact zero mode in contrast to the standard and Boriçi's construction. However, due to the rapid convergence of the rational function approximation, the approximate zero mode is of small magnitude for already moderate values of Ns.

Overlap operators.

In the Ns  →    ∞   limit the effective operators can be formulated as overlap operators defined in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDov] with the kernel H given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefH]. In Fig. [\ref=fig:free-dov] we can find the spectra of [formula] together with the stereographic projection π of the eigenvalues onto the imaginary axis via

[formula]

We also point out the high degree of symmetry of the spectrum in the case of Adams' overlap. As noted before, the effective Dirac operators in Boriçi's and the optimal construction converge towards Neuberger's/Adams' overlap operator for Ns  →    ∞  , while in the standard construction we find a modified overlap kernel.

[formula] gauge field case

While the free field is certainly an important case, our main interest is the performance of the Dirac operators in background fields. Dealing with the Schwinger model, for the rest of the work we consider [formula] gauge fields. We use thermalized gauge fields at an inverse coupling β = 5 from Ref. [\cite=Durr:2004ta] (for more details see Ref. [\cite=Durr:2003xs]).

Kernel operators.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:gauge-kernel] we can see the kernel spectra in a gauge background with Q = 1. As expected in the Schwinger model, the branches stay much sharper and well separated compared to the [formula]-dimensional QCD case [\cite=deForcrand:2011ak] [\cite=deForcrand:2012bm] [\cite=Durr:2013gp] [\cite=Adams:2013tya].

Bulk operators.

In Figs. [\ref=fig:gauge-wilson-dbulk] and [\ref=fig:gauge-stw-dbulk] we show the spectra of the bulk operators on the same gauge configuration as used in Fig. [\ref=fig:gauge-kernel]. Due to the use of a gauge configuration with [formula], the effective operator is guaranteed to have [formula] exact zero modes in the limit Ns  →    ∞  . In this setting we find [formula] eigenvalues in the vicinity of the origin in the bulk spectrum, which are linked to these zero modes. We can also see how the optimal construction distorts the spectrum, effectively improving chiral properties and resulting in a reduced [formula].

Effective operators.

In Figs. [\ref=fig:gauge-deff-Ns2] and [\ref=fig:gauge-deff-Ns8] we plot the spectra of the effective operators on the same gauge field background as used in Fig. [\ref=fig:gauge-kernel]. We note that for [formula] Boriçi's construction outperforms the standard construction with respect to all measures [formula], [formula] and [formula].

The optimal construction decreases most of these numbers even further. Note that as in a [formula] background field the kernel operator is in general not normal, the inequality [formula] does not have to be saturated. Moreover it is evident that a smaller maximum deviation [formula] from the [formula] function on a given interval does not necessarily translate to a smaller [formula], although there is strong correlation. For larger Ns this problem is cured by the fast convergence of optimal domain wall fermions.

Let us remark that optimal domain wall fermions are optimal in a very particular sense, namely the minimization of [formula] as defined in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DeltaMax]. As Ref. [\cite=Brower:2005qw] suggests, they are not optimal with respect to e.g. the number of iterations needed for solving a linear system. In principle, one could also formulate domain wall fermions optimized with respect to other measures, such as the minimization of [formula] (which, however, might require more knowledge about the spectrum).

Comparing domain wall fermions with a Wilson and staggered Wilson kernel, we can see that in the case of the standard construction [formula], [formula] and [formula] are usually of the same magnitude. However, for Boriçi's and the optimal construction a staggered Wilson kernel seems to outperform the usual Wilson kernel in terms of chiral symmetry violations in the [formula] background fields under consideration.

For the rather artificial case Ns = 2 we can make some interesting observations. While for a staggered Wilson kernel the relative performances of all formulations under consideration is comparable, for a Wilson kernel the standard formulation performs better than Boriçi's and markedly better than optimal.

Overlap operators.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:gauge-dov] we give the corresponding overlap operators together with the stereographic projection of the spectrum. All of the quantities [formula], [formula] and [formula] vanish in exact arithmetic and are therefore omitted in the figure labels.

Smearing

In realistic simulations, smearing is a commonly employed technique. As suggested in Ref. [\cite=Durr:2013gp], it is expected to be especially beneficial when employing a staggered Wilson kernel (in 3 + 1 dimensions this is more pronounced). Hence we also consider 3-step ape smeared [\cite=Falcioni:1984ei] [\cite=Albanese:1987ds] gauge field backgrounds with a smearing parameter α = 0.5, which is the maximal value within the perturbatively reasonable range in two dimensions [\cite=Capitani:2006ni].

As a first test on the impact on the performance of staggered domain wall fermions, we can find a direct comparison at Ns = 4 in Figs. [\ref=fig:gauge-wilson-smearing] and [\ref=fig:gauge-stw-smearing] between an unsmeared and a smeared version of a configuration both for a Wilson and a staggered Wilson kernel. As we can see, with three smearing steps [formula], [formula] and [formula] get reduced significantly--in some cases of up to two orders of magnitude--with the exception of [formula] for standard domain wall fermions with Wilson kernel.

Topology

As discussed earlier, for topological charges [formula], the Atiyah-Singer index theorem guarantees the existence of zero modes of the continuum Dirac operator. On the lattice one can show the same for the overlap operators defined in Eq. [\eqref=eq:DefDov].

As a consequence we observe approximate zero modes in the eigenvalue spectra of the effective operators [formula] for [formula] as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:gauge-stw-topology]. As the Vanishing Theorem holds in 1 + 1 dimensions, we find these modes with a multiplicity of [formula].

Conclusions

In this work we gave an explicit construction of staggered domain wall fermions and investigated some of their basic properties in the free field case and on individual gauge configurations in the Schwinger model. It appears that staggered domain wall fermions indeed work as advertised.

Moreover, in addition to the staggered kernel itself, one can also generalize existing modifications of domain wall fermions, such as Boriçi's and the optimal construction to the staggered case. This gives rise to previously not considered "truncated staggered domain wall fermions" and "optimal staggered domain wall fermions". These modified staggered domain wall fermions in particular seem to be on a par with (or even better than) the traditional Wilson based formulations, at least in our setting and with respect to the criteria used in this work.

It is not yet clear how our results in [formula] background gauge fields will translate to QCD in 3 + 1 dimensions with a [formula] gauge group, but they are encouraging and warrant further investigations.

Optimal weights

In the following we give some example values for the weight factors as defined in Sec. [\ref=sub:Optimal-construction]. To this end, let us consider the free field case in 1 + 1 dimensions with the particular choices M0 = 1 and Ns = 8. For the Wilson kernel we then have [formula] and [formula], for the staggered Wilson kernel [formula] and [formula]. The corresponding example weights [formula] for optimal domain wall fermions can be found in Table [\ref=tab:Example-weights].
