Fractional integral operators for [formula] and weighted [formula] vector fields and its applications

Introduction

For [formula] and r > 0. Let Br(x) denote the open ball centered at x of radius r. Let f be a locally integrable function. For any [formula], the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function [formula] of f is defined by

[formula]

For 0 < λ < n, the fractional integral operator [formula] is defined by

[formula]

which is also called the Riesz potential. We recall classical results on the Riesz potential, see [\cite=LDY2007]. Consequently, by Kolmogorov's theorem (see [\cite=LDY2007]), for any set [formula] with finite measure, we have Iλf∈Lr(E) and

[formula]

It is well-known that Iλ is not a bounded operator from L1 to Lq. But if we work in some subsets of L1, such as [formula] and Hardy space [formula], we can expect substitute results.

Stein and Weiss [\cite=SteinW] established a doubly weighted generalization of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality as follows.

De Nápoli, Drelichman and Durán [\cite=DDD2011] found that if we reduce ourselves to radially symmetric functions, Theorem [\ref=SW] holds for a wider range of exponents. For radially symmetric functions, they pointed out that if p > 1, Theorem [\ref=SW] holds for [formula]; if p = 1, Theorem [\ref=SW] holds for [formula].

Considering that we are interested in the extreme case p = 1 of Stein-Weiss inequality, we turn to end-point estimates for L1 vector fields, which was pioneered by Bourgain and Brezis [\cite=BB2002]. For any vector-valued function [formula], we denote by [formula] the Newtonian potential of [formula]. For [formula], Bourgain and Brezis [\cite=BB2004] [\cite=BB2007] proved that

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

Hence, for [formula], it holds that

[formula]

For n = 2, they also proved

[formula]

Moreover, for divergence-free vector fields, Chanillo and Yung [\cite=CY2012] pointed out the following result, which is also a consequence of [\cite=VanSch2010] and embedding theorem of homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.

Maz'ya [\cite=Mazya2010] established weighted inequalities related to [\eqref=ineq11] as follows:

Let 1  ≤  q < n', [formula] and [formula] satisfying [formula]. Then it holds that

[formula]

Let 1 < q < n', [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then it holds that

[formula]

Soon after, Bousquet and Mironescu [\cite=BM2011] gave a short proof of Maz'ya's result and got a little improvement. They found that the inequality [\eqref=ineqM] holds also for q = 1. In fact, using Leray decomposition and a similar trick used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], we can prove that the inequality [\eqref=ineq13] and the result of Bousquet and Mironescu are equivalent, see Remark [\ref=Equivalent]. Inspired by these inequalities, we try to extend the range of exponents that Theorem [\ref=SW] holds for in the case of weighted vector fields. We introduce a family of fractional integral operators [formula] defined by

[formula]

where the kernel K(x) satisfies

[formula]

We give two examples of such kernels: K(x) = |x|λ - n and [formula]. If you want to check and learn more, see Proposition [\ref=K-condition]. Hence, ( - Δ)- 1f is of the type [formula] for n > 2 and [formula] is of the type [formula] for [formula].

In this paper, we establish end-point estimates for the fractional integral operators for vector fields in some subspaces of L1 via the fractional Laplacian, and we adopt the skills developed by Maz'ya, Bousquet, Mironescu to deal with the fractional integral operators for vector fields in some subspaces of weighted L1. As a result, we find some spaces of vector-valued functions make Stein-Weiss inequalities hold for the case p = 1. We now state our main results.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give some notations that have appeared in the context. Section 3 shows the proofs of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0] and Theorem [\ref=ZZB]. In Section 4, applying the new inequalities and classical Stein-Weiss inequalities, we give a new proof to Hardy inequality as well as a class of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities and obtain new [formula]-[formula] inequalities for vector fields.

Notations and definitions

Let [formula]. The notation [formula] denotes the space of n-dimensional vector-valued functions that are infinitely differentiable and have compact supports in Ω. Let [formula] denote the dual space of [formula]. We denote Zygmund space by L log +L(E), which is defined as follows: if the function f satisfies

[formula]

then we say f∈L log +L(E), where [formula] and log +t is defined by

[formula]

The Riesz transform [formula] is defined by

[formula]

It is not difficult to see that [formula]. The Hardy space [formula] is defined by

[formula]

and its norm is given by

[formula]

Let S stand for the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing C∞ functions in [formula]. When 0 < α < 2 and f∈S, [formula] is defined by a singular integral

[formula]

By [\cite=DPV2012], the singularity of the above integral can be removed by a weighted second order differential quotient, i.e.,

[formula]

There are several equivalent definitions of the fractional Laplacian operator, see [\cite=DPV2012] or [\cite=Silv]. The space [formula] is defined by

[formula]

and is provided with the norm

[formula]

In particular, the space [formula] is given by

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the closure of [formula] in [formula]. It is well-known that [formula]. Proposition [\ref=H-div] implies that [formula] has the same property, i.e., [formula]. We denote the fundamental solution of -  Δ by

[formula]

For any real number p > 1, we let p' denote its conjugate index, i.e., [formula]. If p = 1, we set p' =   ∞  .

We recall the definition of curl operator. When n = 2, curl operator is defined by

[formula]

When n = 3, curl operator is defined by

[formula]

There is another definition of curl operator, which is defined as a matrix of order [formula]. We denote the element of the matrix [formula] by

[formula]

For a matrix [formula], where [formula], we define its divergence by

[formula]

For any [formula], it holds that

[formula]

Throughout this paper, bold typeface will indicate vector or matrix quantities; normal typeface will be used for vector and matrix components and for scalars. To simplify the notations, we write [formula] and [formula] instead of [formula] and [formula], respectively.

Proofs of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0] and Theorem [\ref=ZZB]

We supply two tips to help to verify that whether the kernel K(x) satisfies the conditions in [\eqref=Condition] or not.

Let [formula].

(1) By differential mean value theorem, there exists a θ∈(0,1) such that

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

(2) Obviously, we only need to verify the inequality

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the Lipschitz constant of ω(x) on [formula].

It holds that

[formula]

By the condition (i) in [\eqref=Condition], we obtain

[formula]

By the condition (i) in [\eqref=Condition], we have

[formula]

Thanks to the condition (ii) in [\eqref=Condition], if [formula] then

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Therefore, this lemma completes by combining the above four inequalities.

Lemma [\ref=frac-lap] implies [formula]. More generally, if 0 < α < n, β < 2 and 0 < α  -  β < n, then [formula], cf. [\cite=FLS2008]. This equality is an easy consequence of a scaling transform and an orthogonal transform, except for the value of the constant.

(1) It holds that

[formula]

For any |x|  ≥  2R, we have

[formula]

(2) We have

[formula]

For any |x|  ≥  2R, we have

[formula]

(3) We can write

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

(4) Similar to the proof of the second item, we write

[formula]

By the first estimate in the first item, we get

[formula]

By the estimate in the third item, we get

[formula]

Combining the above three inequalities, we obtain the estimate [\eqref=esti36].

For any |x|  ≥  2R, by Fubini's theorem and Lemma [\ref=frac-K], we get

[formula]

[formula]

By Remark [\ref=frac-lap+], we get [formula], where 0 < α  <  λ. Moreover, C1C2 = 1, cf. [\cite=FLS2008]. Next lemma indicates that K(x) also has this similar property.

The parameter α > 0 is to be determined. We first show that [formula] is well-defined. In fact, by Lemma [\ref=frac-K] and [\ref=frac-lap], we get

[formula]

here we require α  <  λ and α < 1.

Moreover, for any 0 < τ  <  α, [formula] is a function of [formula]. Let [formula] and x be a point near x0. Thanks to the inequality (cf. [\cite=LL2001])

[formula]

where a,b > 0, m > 0 and γ∈(0,1), and using Lemma [\ref=frac-K] and [\ref=frac-lap], we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. By Fubini's theorem, we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=frac-K] and [\ref=frac-esti], we get

[formula]

Hence, by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, we get

[formula]

By a simple calculation, we have

[formula]

[formula]

here we require α < n - λ to guarantee [formula]. When [formula], by the inequality [\eqref=ineq3.4], we have

[formula]

When [formula], we have

[formula]

In conclusion, we obtain

[formula]

Hence by Lemma [\ref=frac-esti], we have

[formula]

[formula]

By Fubini's theorem, then we obtain

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=frac-esti], we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Then by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, we get

[formula]

[formula]

Combining the equalities [\eqref=eq313], [\eqref=eq314] and [\eqref=eq315], we obtain

[formula]

Hence, by the equality [\eqref=eq312], we get

[formula]

here we use a result that [formula] a.e. [formula] for any [formula]. Actually, for any [formula], it is similar to the equality [\eqref=eq316] but much easier to get the following equality:

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=frac-esti], we have [formula] and [formula], here we require [formula]. Taking into consideration the conditions on α, we choose [formula]. By Plancherel theorem and [\cite=DPV2012], we obtain

[formula]

which completes our proof.

Step 1. First, we deal with the divergence-free vector field, i.e., [formula]. For any λ∈(0,n), set [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=frac-K-id], Fubini's theorem and Theorem [\ref=HLS], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=frac-K], Theorem [\ref=HLS] and [\ref=CY], we obtain

[formula]

where [formula].

Step 2. Next, we turn to non-divergence-free vector field. We decompose [formula] as [formula], which is called the Leray decomposition of [formula]. [formula] is the divergence-free part while [formula] is the curl-free part. Since [formula], by Step 1, we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, for 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n, set [formula]), gk = 0 if k  ≠  i,j. Then we have [formula]. By Step 1, we obtain

[formula]

Hence, we have

[formula]

Therefore, the inequality [\eqref=ineq16] follows from the inequalities [\eqref=ineq31] and [\eqref=ineq32].

By the way, using our idea, we can get an improvement of [\cite=BF2002], where they require that the kernel K(x) is a [formula] function satisfying |K(x)|  ≤  C|x|λ - n and [formula]. In the following proposition, we weaken the smoothness of the kernels and expand the range of the kernels.

By the same idea of the proof of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Thus we complete our proof by using the following inequality (see [\cite=SW1960])

[formula]

When [formula], by [\cite=SSV] and a standard approximation argument, the above inequality can be replaced by

[formula]

Let n  ≥  2 and 0 < λ < n. We point out that if [formula] and [formula] then [formula]. We verify this fact in three cases. When λ = 1, by Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, we have [formula]. When 1 < λ < n, since

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=HLS], we get [formula]. When 0 < λ < 1, since

[formula]

by [\cite=SSV], we obtain [formula]. We can also illustrate this fact as follows. By Theorem [\ref=ZZB0] with K(x) = |x|λ - n, we get [formula], then it follows that [formula]. Inspired by inequality [\eqref=ineq12] and the above fact, naturally, we consider extending Theorem [\ref=CY] and Theorem [\ref=ZZB0] to the vector field, whose divergence is in negative Sobolev spaces, and raise the following question.

Applying inequality [\eqref=ineq13] to [formula] in the proof of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], we can get

[formula]

where 1  ≤  q < n', [formula]. Using this inequality, we can derive inequality [\eqref=ineqM] for 1  ≤  q < n' from inequality [\eqref=ineq13] by the same method as the proof of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0].

It suffices to show that [formula] is dense in [formula]. Assume that [formula]. Set [formula], where η is the standard mollifier. We have that [formula] and [formula] in [formula] as ε  →  0. Let ζ∈C∞c(B2(0)) be a cut-off function such that 0  ≤  ζ  ≤  1 and [formula] in B1(0). Set [formula], then [formula]. By the definition of divergence operator, we get

[formula]

Therefore, for any fixed ε, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

By the above two inequalities and [formula] in [formula] as ε  →  0, we know that for any ε > 0, there exists k = k(ε) such that [formula] in [formula] as ε  →  0.

Let 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . Then the set [formula] is dense in [formula], cf. [\cite=AN2011].

Since [formula] is dense in [formula], by the divergence theorem and an approximation argument, we obtain the following corollary.

Let [formula] be a cut-off function such that 0  ≤  ρ0  ≤  1 and

[formula]

We denote [formula] for [formula]. We extract a lemma from the proof of the main theorem in [\cite=BM2011], but in a simple case.

For any |x|  ≠  0, we have [formula] and

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=Gauss0], we get

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

So we get

[formula]

Of course, we can also obtain this lemma in a similar way to [\cite=BM2011]. First, we prove this lemma for smooth functions, then complete the proof by an approximation argument.

In view of the proof of Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], we claim that Theorem [\ref=ZZB] is equivalent to the following statement.

Let n  ≥  2, 0 < λ < n, α < 1, [formula], α  +  β > 0, [formula] and [formula]. If 1  ≤  q <   ∞  , then

[formula]

Hence, we only need to prove the case of [formula]. The benefit of this observation is that there is no need to deal with the term [formula] in Lemma [\ref=BMlemma] for [formula] is a divergence-free vector field, which is different from [\cite=BM2011].

We begin to prove the inequality [\eqref=Zineq1].

Step 1. We write [formula], where

[formula]

By the condition (i) in [\eqref=Condition] and generalized Minkowski's inequality, we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

here we require n - βq > 0 and n + (λ - n)q > 0, then we get

[formula]

Step 2. We write J1(x) = J11(x) + J12(x), where

[formula]

Thus by generalized Minkowski's inequality and the condition (ii) in [\eqref=Condition], we obtain

[formula]

here we require n + (λ - n - 1 - β)q < 0, i.e., α < 1.

Step 3. At last we deal with the term J12(x). By the condition (i) in [\eqref=Condition], we have

[formula]

Due to Lemma [\ref=BMlemma] and generalized Minkowski's inequality, we get

[formula]

here we require n + (λ - n - β - 1)q < 0.

Combining the inequalities [\eqref=ineq35], [\eqref=ineq36] and [\eqref=ineq37], we obtain the result.

Let [formula]. For [formula], by Theorem [\ref=ZZB] with K(x) = |x|2 - n, then we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]. If we set [formula] in Theorem [\ref=ZZB], then we can see that our result generalizes the inequality [\eqref=ineqM] in a doubly weighted form.

Applications

There are many proofs to Hardy inequality (cf. [\cite=DDE2012]). Here we give a new proof of Hardy inequality by the theory of singular integrals. If 1 < p < n, we can use Theorem [\ref=SW] to prove Hardy inequality

[formula]

But Theorem [\ref=SW] doesn't work when p = 1. Our theorem make it possible to prove the case p = 1. At the same time, we can also give another approach to Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality

[formula]

In fact, for any [formula], we have the equality (see [\cite=GT1998])

[formula]

If p > 1, by Theorem [\ref=SW], we have

[formula]

If p > 1, by Theorem [\ref=SW], we have

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=vectorid], for any function [formula], we have

[formula]

Therefore, for divergence-free or curl-free smooth vector fields with compact support, the term [formula] can be removed in the inequality [\eqref=ineq16] while the term [formula] can be removed in the inequality [\eqref=ineq17].

If p = 1, since [formula] or [formula], setting [formula] in Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], we get

[formula]

The above inequality can also be deduced from an inequality established by Bourgain and Brezis and Calderón-Zygmund inequality, see [\cite=VanSch2004] or [\cite=VanSch2008]. Setting [formula] in Theorem [\ref=ZZB], we get

[formula]

Moreover, by the same idea, we can give a new proof of a class of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities (see [\cite=CKN1984]) as follows:

Let n  ≥  2. If α < 1, [formula], 0 < α  +  β  ≤  1 and [formula], then

[formula]

If 1 < p <   ∞  , [formula], [formula], α  +  β  ≥  0 and [formula], p  ≤  q <   ∞  , then

[formula]

Take α = 0 in the inequality [\eqref=CKN1], we get

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and 1  ≤  q < n'.

Another application is to establish some new weighted [formula]-[formula] inequalities, and to give a new proof to inequalities of Bourgain and Brezis, Lanzani and Stein, see [\cite=BB2004] [\cite=BB2007] or [\cite=LS2005].

By Green's representation formula and the vector identity [formula], we obtain

[formula]

We have used integration by parts twice in the above calculations.

If p > 1, by Theorem [\ref=SW] and the following inequality

[formula]

we get the third item.

If p = 1 and [formula], since [formula], by Theorem [\ref=ZZB] and the following inequality

[formula]

we get the first item. By Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], Proposition [\ref=Ben-imp] and the identity [\eqref=vector-id1], we get the second item.

We replace [formula] by [formula] in the inequality [\eqref=Hardy-div]. Recently, Xiang and the author [\cite=XZ2015] have established some related inequalities in smooth bounded domains.

We can generalize Theorem [\ref=threecurl] to general dimensions.

By Green's representation formula and the identity [\eqref=vectorid], we obtain

[formula]

where the dot product between a vector [formula] and a matrix [formula] is defined by [formula].

If p > 1, then by Theorem [\ref=SW], we obtain the third item.

Next we turn to the case p = 1 and [formula]. For 1  ≤  i < j < k  ≤  n, set [formula], fl = 0 if l  ≠  i,j,k. Then we have [formula]. Applying Theorem [\ref=ZZB] to [formula], then we obtain

[formula]

for any 1  ≤  m  ≤  n. Then using the identity [\eqref=vector-id2] with [formula], we get the first item. By Theorem [\ref=ZZB0], Proposition [\ref=Ben-imp] and the identity [\eqref=vector-id2], we get the second item.

We can give another proof to the third inequality of Theorem [\ref=ZZBn]. We first state the following two facts:

For any [formula], it holds that

[formula]

If 1 < p <   ∞   and [formula], then |x|αp is in the class Ap (see [\cite=LDY2007]).

Using the above two results and the idea of proof given in [\cite=JWX2013], we can generalize [\cite=JWX2013] to any dimension n  ≥  2:

If 1 < p <   ∞   and [formula], then for any [formula], we have the following weighted inequality for div-curl-grad operators

[formula]

By Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality [\eqref=CKNp] and the above inequality, we can also obtain the third item of Theorem [\ref=ZZBn]. However, this method is not applicable for the case p = 1.
