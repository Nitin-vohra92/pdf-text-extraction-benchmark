Radio Non-Detection of the SGR 1806-  20 Giant Flare and Implications for Fast Radio Bursts

Introduction

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright (0.1-30 Jy peak flux), millisecond-timescale bursts with an event-rate of [formula] [\citep=rane2016] at 1.4 GHz. To date, 16 events have been reported: 14 from the Parkes observatory [\citep=lorimer2007] [\citep=keane2011] [\citep=thornton2013] [\citep=burkespolaor2014] [\citep=petroff2015a] [\citep=champion2015] [\citep=ravi2015], one from the Arecibo radio telescope [\citep=spitler2014] and one from the Green Bank telescope [\citep=masui2015]. Unlike 'perytons' [\citep=burkespolaor2011a] which are now known to be local sources of interference [\citep=petroff2015b], FRBs very precisely obey the ν- 2 time-delay induced by cold plasma. The hallmark is their dispersion measure (DM), which is much greater (by factors of 3-10) than the DM contribution expected from the Galactic interstellar medium. The excess DM may be intrinsic to the source, placing it within the Galaxy, although this possibility now seems unlikely; it may arise mostly from the intergalactic medium, placing a source of FRBs at cosmological distances ([formula]) or it may arise from the host galaxy, placing a source of FRBs at extragalactic, but not necessarily cosmological, distances ([formula] kpc).

Due to FRBs' mysterious nature and lack of information, a plethora of source models have been proposed including Crab-like giant pulses from young extra-galactic pulsars [\citep=cordes2015], planets in pulsar magnetospheres [\citep=mottez2014], neutron-star mergers and the 'blitzar' model [\citep=totani2013] [\citep=ravi2014], black hole-neutron star mergers [\citep=mingarelli2015], magnetar pulse-wind interactions [\citep=lyubarsky2014], flares from nearby stars [\citep=loeb2014], quark novae [\citep=shand2015], and perhaps most popularly, magnetar giant flares [\citep=popov2010] [\citep=popov2013] [\citep=kulkarni2014] [\citep=katz2014] [\citep=katz2015] [\citep=pen2015] [\citep=kulkarni2015].

Magnetar Giant Flares as FRBs

Galactic magnetars -- neutron stars with strong inferred surface magnetic field strengths ([formula] G) -- have been observed to emit extremely luminous X-ray and γ-ray bursts known as giant flares. Since the advent of X-ray and γ-ray astronomy, we have observed three giant flares: one from SGR 0526-  66 on 1979 March 5 [\citep=mazets1979], one from SGR 1900+14 on 1998 August 27 [\citep=hurley1999] and one from SGR 1806-  20 on 2004 December 27 [\citep=palmer2005] [\citep=hurley2005] [\citep=terasawa2005]. A giant flare consists of a luminous, sharp, hard X-ray peak, with rise time of order milliseconds, lasting 50-100 ms, followed by an oscillating tail that is [formula] times fainter.

Coherent radio counterparts of X-ray bursts from magnetars have been proposed with fluxes as high as 1  kJy [\citep=lyutikov2002] [\citep=lyutikov2006]. Immediately after the 'Lorimer' burst of 2001, [\citet=popov2010] suggested that such a burst may be a radio counterpart of an extra-galactic magnetar giant flare. With the discovery of more FRBs, multiple authors furthered the explanation, pointing out the good correspondance between the FRB and giant flare energetics, rates and between the observed high DMs and the dense gas in star forming regions [\citep=popov2013] [\citep=katz2015] [\citep=pen2015] [\citep=kulkarni2015]. [\citet=katz2014] suggested that an FRB from a Galactic magnetar giant flare should be O(1011) times brighter (~  10-100 MJy) and would be easily discoverable even in the sidelobes of telescopes.

Here we report on archival Parkes radio telescope data obtained coincidentally with the 2004 December 27 giant flare of SGR 1806-  20. In Section [\ref=sec:parkes] we use these data to place stringent limits on any radio emission produced by this event, and in Section [\ref=sec:gamma-ray] we calculate the radio to gamma-ray fluence ratio with those observed for the 15 FRBs for which this information is available. As we discuss in Section [\ref=sec:discussion], our results call into question models in which FRBs arise from magnetar giant flares.

Radio Non-Detection of SGR 1806-  20 Giant Flare

The giant flare from magnetar SGR 1806-  20 was the brightest γ-ray event in astronomical history and saturated all the γ-ray observatories [\citep=hurley2005] [\citep=palmer2005] [\citep=mazets2005] [\citep=terasawa2005]. The γ-ray fluence of the giant flare (in the sharp peak) was estimated to be [formula] above 50 keV [\citep=terasawa2005] from the Geotail satellite. [\citet=hurley2005] estimated the fluence to be [formula] above 30 keV. [\citet=palmer2005] estimated the fluence to be [formula] between 45 keV and 10 MeV. In this work, we use a value of [formula] since it is closer in energy band to the detections of the current γ-ray instruments, but our conclusion is not sensitive to this range of values.

Flare Arrival Time

The peak of the giant flare crossed the Earth's center at 21:30:25.64 UT [\citep=mazets2005]. At the epoch of the γ-ray flare, SGR 1806-  20 was at an altitude of 31.5 and an azimuth of 95.1 (East of North) at the Parkes Observatory (longitude = 148.2635101, latitude = -  32.9984064, altitude=414.80 m). Based on the geometry, the flare wavefront should have arrived at Parkes 11 ms before it crossed the center of the Earth, i.e. at 21:30:25.53 UT. These transformations were calculated using the astropy.coordinates and astropy.time routines [\citep=astropy2013].

The telescope started observing pulsar PSR J1557-  4258 at 21:29:19 UT with the central beam of the Parkes multi-beam receiver and the SCAMP observing system. The telescope was pointed at altitude of 63.1 and an azimuth of 121.1, 35.6 away from the location of SGR 1806-  20. SGR 1806-  20 was not hidden behind the telescope feed legs. If the giant flare was accompanied by a prompt radio flare similar to FRBs, we would expect it to arrive 66.5 s+[formula] from the beginning of the observation, where [formula] is the time delay between radio and γ-ray pulses due to dispersion.

Based on the distance to SGR 1806-  20 [\citep=bibby2008] and the NE2001 model [\citep=cordes2002], [\citet=lazarus2012] estimated the DM to SGR 1806-  20 to be [formula]. The 90% upper limit for the distance of SGR 1806-  20 was estimated to be 18.6 kpc [\citep=svirski2011] with a corresponding model-predicted DM of 1423[formula]. The model-predicted scattering timescales at 1.4 GHz are 14 ms and 56 ms for distances of 8.7 kpc and 18.6 kpc, respectively. We discuss the possibility of the NE2001 model underpredicting the scattering in this direction in Section [\ref=sec:scattering].

We derive another estimate for the DM from the line-of-sight column density estimated from X-ray observations [\citep=younes2015]. [\citet=he2013] measured the correlation between [formula] and DM to be [formula]. The corresponding DM for SGR 1806-  20 is [formula], much lower than the value based on the distance estimates and the NE2001 model.

The dispersion delay between the γ-ray and any radio prompt emission at 1.374 GHz is [formula], corresponding to 2.20 s/1000 [formula].

As described in the next section, we analysed the Parkes data to search for a bright single burst from SGR 1806-  20.

Archival Parkes Data and Analysis

We downloaded the Parkes data (program number: PT242, data file name: PT0242_037) from the Parkes data archive and converted from the 1-bit SCAMP raw data format to 8-bit filterbank data using filterbank program from SIGPROC. The filterbank data were processed with a single pulse searching pipeline based on PRESTO utilities. The pipeline has been described in detail by [\citet=spitler2014] and we summarize the data analysis here. The raw data were not cleaned for radio frequency interference (RFI) to avoid accidentally excising bursts. Instead, we visually looked at the time-frequency plots of burst candidates to weed out RFI.

We created a de-dispersion plan for searching DMs between 0-3940 [formula] with DM steps ranging from 0.5 [formula] at the low DM end to 30 [formula] above 3220 [formula]. The upper limit was chosen to be approximately three times the largest predicted Galactic DM, consistent but even broader than the above estimates. Single pulse candidates are identified in each dedispersed time series using a matched filtering algorithm (single_pulse_search.py). This algorithm match-filters the time series with a series of boxcar filters to search for single pulse candidates of widths ranging from 1 to 300 time bins (0.25[formula] to 75 ms). We grouped the candidates with similar DM and arrival time and made time-frequency ('waterfall') plots for verification.

Figure [\ref=fig:parkes_singlepulse] shows the results of the single pulse searching algorithm. The circles in the bottom plot denote the detected single pulse candidates as a function of arrival time and DM. The radii of the circles represent the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the detection. The three upper plots show the statistics of the single pulse candidates as explained in the caption. The line of intense detections at DM=144 [formula] are pulses from PSR J1557-  4258 and serve as a sanity check of our pipeline. The red track shows the expected flare arrival time 66.5 s+[formula] after the start of the observation. The cluster of candidates at DM[formula] was verified to be narrow-band RFI at 1500 MHz. At the horizontal scale of the plot, the width of the track corresponds to [formula] s and it is unlikely for a radio burst to arrive outside that location unless the radio and γ-ray emission were separated in emission time.

With a non-detection of a radio flare from SGR 1806-  20, we now set limits on the radio flux using the system parameters and by estimating the sidelobe suppression of the Parkes telescope.

Radio Flux Limits

To calculate the lower limit on the flux of a single pulse detection in the Parkes data, we used the methodology of the Parkes multi-beam pulsar survey [\citep=manchester2001] which uses the same instrumentation as the data analyzed here. The limiting flux density is given by

[formula]

where σ = 1.5 is a loss factor (from the one-bit sampling as well as other effects), β = 6 is detection SNR threshold, [formula] K is the system temperature, G = 0.735 K/Jy is the telescope gain for the central beam, B = 288  MHz is the telescope bandwidth, Np = 2 is the number of polarizations and [formula] is the observing time. Thus, for [formula] ms, a reasonable estimate for a intrinsically narrow pulse scattered at a timescale of 14 ms, we get a 6-σ limit of 11 mJy. For a 1-ms and 50-ms bursts, the extreme ranges of scattering, the limits are 35 mJy and 5 mJy, respectively. The corresponding radio fluence limits for 10-ms, 1-ms, and 50-ms timescales are 110 mJy-ms, 35 mJy-ms and 250 mJy-ms, respectively.

Scattering Timescales

The 1-bit digitizer backend used in the Parkes observations included a high-pass filter of time constant ~  0.9 s [\citep=manchester2001]. The Parkes system thus had reduced sensitivity to signals with rise times comparable or longer than this time constant. However, this should not be a significant issue when considering a putative radio burst from SGR 1806-  20 as the scattering measures, noted above, are predicted to be 14 ms and 56 ms for a distance of 8.7 kpc and 18.6 kpc, respectively. Note that the times refer to the 1/e decay time of a one-sided exponential that is convolved with the signal if scattered, i.e. the rise time should be significantly shorter than these quoted times. Further, we note that the Parkes multi-beam survey discovered PSR J1307-  6318 which has period 5 s and duty cycle of 50% [\citep=manchester2001]. Its pulse rise time is ~  40-50 ms, comparable to the maximum likely scattering time for SGR 1806-  20 even if it were as distant as 18.6 kpc. Hence, we conclude that the Parkes high-pass filtering is unlikely to have had a deleterious effect on any radio burst from the SGR 1806-  20, even for scattering times as long as ~  56 ms.

We note that if the NE2001 model underpredicts the scattering time in this direction by a factor of 20 or more, the signal may be suppressed by the high-pass filter and may be undetectable. However, we find this to be unlikely from observations of other pulsars in that direction. From the ATNF pulsar catalog [\citep=manchester2005], we compiled a list of pulsars located within a 2 radius of SGR 1806-  20 with DM [formula], their pulse profiles, and pulse widths at half peak-intensity ([formula]) at 1.4 GHz [\citep=morris2002] [\citep=hobbs2004]. We find seven pulsars with a DM range of [formula]. The pulse profiles of four pulsars are symmetrical or show very small scattering tails with [formula] ms, suggesting a scattering timescale [formula] ms. Three pulsars have visible scattering tails, the longest having [formula] ms at DM [formula] (PSR 1809-  2004). The corresponding NE2001 scattering timescale estimates for these DM are between 15-22 ms, corresponding to [formula] ms for zero intrinsic width pulses, within a factor of three from the measured values.

Far Sidelobe Response and Suppression

As SGR 1806-  20 was 35.6 away from the pointing center of Parkes, any burst from it would have been detected through the sidelobe response of Parkes, suppressed by many orders of magnitude. Since the far sidelobes are highly suppressed, they are not ordinarily well-characterized.

The Parkes multi-beam instrument [\citep=staveleysmith1996] was primarily designed for 21-cm (1.42 GHz) HI surveys [\citep=mccluregriffiths2009] which require careful modelling of the near and far sidelobe response to accurately account for stray radiation [\citep=kalberla2010], albeit at a coarse spatial scale (~  degree). The far sidelobe structure of Parkes is dominated by reflections off the three feed support legs ('stray cones') and radiation from beyond the primary dish ('spillover'). [\citet=kalberla2010] modeled the Parkes far sidelobe structure as a constant base level with three stray cones of radius 40 and width ±  3.3. By simultaneous modelling of the sidelobes and deconvolution of the Galactic HI maps, [\citet=kalberla2010] fit the suppression of the stray cones and constant base level to be 54 dB and 70 dB, respectively, below the primary sensitivity.

At the time of the flare, SGR 1806-  20 was at a location [formula] in antenna coordinates [\citep=kalberla1980], where θ is the angular separation from the telescope central beam and φ is the position angle, measured north through east. This position is 6.4 (less than one full-width at half maximum) away from a stray cone (P. Kalberla, private communication). The suppression at this position, may be estimated to be between 54 dB and 70 dB, [formula] dB. We note with caution that these values are based on averaging over ~  degree angular scales.

In estimating the strengths of 'perytons' which were also detected in the far sidelobes of the Parkes telescope, [\citet=burkespolaor2011a] estimate the suppression factor for Parkes sidelobes to be 2500-850000 (corresponding to 34-59 dB) for the multi-beam receiver. Perytons are known to be near-field due to their coincident detection in all the 13 beams of the receiver while the radio flare from SGR 1806-  20 would be in the far-field regime. Even so, the end of the range estimated by [\citet=burkespolaor2011a] validates the above estimate.

We also calculated the diffraction-limited response of an ideal 64-m diameter circular aperture with no obstruction from support legs. At an angular distance of 35.6 from the center, we calculated the intensity response compared to unity at the central location at each a finely sampled frequency grid over the observing bandwidth. We then binned the intensity measurements over frequency into 3 MHz channels to simulate the sensitivity of each channel. We also calculated the response including a 2-m diameter central obstruction to account for the receiver block. Figure [\ref=fig:fringes] shows the response of the idealized telescope. In practice, scattering from support legs, reflections from the ground, telescope surface errors will stochastically increase the response in the sidelobes while decreasing the sensitivity in the primary beam. The effect of scattering and reflections is challenging to quantify but it possibly explains the discrepancy between the theoretical suppression compared to the estimate of [\citet=burkespolaor2011a].

Figure [\ref=fig:fringes] also shows that the fringing pattern at large angles varies rapidly in frequency and for a continuum spectrum source, there will be no sharp nulls, i.e. locations in the field of view where the sensitivity drops to zero. Averaging the sidelobe response from Figure [\ref=fig:fringes], we estimate a sensitivity of [formula], i.e. a suppression of 80 dB. The presence of a central obstruction does not significantly change the result.

Upper Limit on [formula]

For a suppression of 60 dB and 80 dB respectively, the 10-ms radio fluence upper limit of 110 mJy-ms, translates to a fluence limit of 110 kJy and 11 MJy, respectively. With a γ-ray fluence of [formula] we get a 6-σ upper limit for [formula] for suppression of 60 dB as estimated by [\citet=burkespolaor2011a] to [formula] for a suppression of 80 dB in the idealized diffraction-limited case calculated above.

Fluence Limit on γ-ray Bursts from FRBs

In the papers reporting most FRBs, the authors have searched the available literature or recent GRB Coordinates Network (GCN) messages and reported a non-detection of any counterpart in the X-ray or γ-ray regime. To set fluence limits on the non-detections, we used the FRB names, radio fluences, epochs and sky locations from the literature (Table [\ref=tab:frb_obs]). For uniformity, we consider only the 15 FRBs that have been detected at  1.4 GHz. We have not included FRB 110523 [\citep=masui2015] since it was detected at 800 MHz and it is not possible to reasonably convert its fluence to 1.4 GHz given the uncertainty in its intrinsic spectral index.

FERMI GRB Burst Monitor

The FERMI-GRB Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument consists of 12 Na-I detectors and two Bi-Ge scintillators [\citep=meegan2009]. These detectors are sensitive to the entire unocculted sky for photon energies from 8 keV to 40 MeV. FERMI-GBM data have been available since 2008 February. As FERMI is in a low-Earth orbit with an average altitude of 550 km, the detections of GRBs are limited by Earth occultation. For each FRB, we analysed the visibility of FRB sky location to FERMI using the spacecraft position history files for a duration of 10 minutes before and after the epoch of the burst to account for any difference in arrival times (Table [\ref=tab:frb_obs]). We find that 6 of the 15 bursts were visible to GBM when they were detected in the radio telescopes.

The on-board trigger threshold of GBM for short bursts is 0.74 [formula] [\citep=meegan2009AIPC] corresponding to a fluence of [formula] for a nominal photon energy of 20 keV and a burst duration of 100 ms, characteristics similar to those of magnetar giant flares. As a conservative estimate for detection completeness, we take the fluence limit to be 5 times higher, i.e. [formula]. This value is corroborated by the faintest short GRB fluences listed in the GBM GRB catalog [\citep=vonkienlin2014].

SWIFT-BAT

The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) instrument aboard the Swift satellite (launched 2004 November) is a coded aperture mask high-energy (15-150 keV) X-ray telescope [\citep=barthelmy2005]. The half coded field of view (FoV) is [formula] (1.4 sr). Using NASA's HEASARC database, we checked if the BAT was pointing within a radius of [formula] of each FRB between 10 minutes before and after the FRB epoch. We find that 8 of the 15 bursts were within the BAT half coded FoV when they were detected in the radio telescopes.

The design burst flux sensitivity of the BAT is [formula] [\citep=barthelmy2005]. For a 100-ms SGR-like burst, this corresponds to a 8-σ fluence sensitivity of [formula]. The short GRBs detected by Swift-BAT are also used to calculate an upper limit on the fluence. From Table 1 of [\citet=sakamoto2011] and Table 1 of [\citet=berger2014] we estimate that the short GRBs (timescale < 2 s) are detected at a 6-σ significance at fluences of [formula].

Konus-WIND

Konus-W is a γ-ray spectrometer aboard the GGS-WIND mission. It has two NaI(Tl) scintillators providing omni-directional sensitivity to γ-ray bursts between 10 keV to 10 MeV [\citep=aptekar1995]. The mission was launched in 1994 November and travelled to its final location at the Earth-Sun L1 point (1.5 million km from Earth) in 2004. At this separation, the Earth covers a negligible area (0.2 sq. deg) in the Konus-W sky and hence the Konus scintillators have an essentially unocculted view of the entire sky.

The design sensitivity of Konus-W is 1-5[formula] [\citep=aptekar1995] at a 6-σ level. [\citet=mazets2004] lists all the GRBs detected by Konus-W between 1994 and 2002. The faintest GRB detected had a fluence of [formula]. [\citet=svinkin2015] calculated the sensitivity of Konus-W to a scaled giant flare from SGR 1806-  20 to be [formula] (9-σ) for the known range of spectral parameters. Due to its unocculted view, we assume the Konus-W sensitivity as the fluence lower limit for γ-ray counterparts for any FRB not in the GBM or BAT FoV.

Lower Limits on [formula]

We define [formula] as the ratio of burst fluence in the 1.4 GHz (radio) and γ-ray bands. Based on the individual γ-ray fluence limits and the observed radio fluences, we find the ~  6-σ lower limits on the FRB radio to γ-ray fluence ratio [formula] to be between [formula] (Table [\ref=tab:frb_obs]).

Discussion

In Section [\ref=sec:parkes], we have derived an upper limit on the radio to γ-ray fluence ratio, [formula] for the 2004 December 27 giant flare of SGR 1806-  20 based on the measured γ-ray fluence and a radio non-detection in the 64-m Parkes telescope for scattering times estimated from the NE2001 model. In Section [\ref=sec:gamma-ray], we have placed ~  6-σ lower limits on [formula] as summarized in Table [\ref=tab:frb_obs] based on the non-detections of prompt γ-ray counterparts to the reported FRBs.

Figure [\ref=fig:eta_plot] summarizes our result, plotting [formula] and the suppression-dependent values of [formula]. Even assuming the strongest suppression for the sidelobe of the Parkes telescope (80 dB) and the scattering timescales from the NE2001 model, all but one of the FRBs have [formula] by a factor of 1.6-100 with the highest η ratio being that of the 'Lorimer' burst (FRB 010724).

Thus our result challenges the hypothesis that the same event mechanism that produces a magnetar giant flare (at least for SGR 1806-  20) also produces the known FRBs simultaneously.

However, next we explore caveats and reasons why this naive conclusion may not exclude magnetar giant flares as the origins of FRBs. This work does not have an obvious applicability to any of the other explanations that have been suggested, hence we limit our discussion to the magnetar giant flare hypothesis.

Variability of η

A straightforward way to reconcile the magnetar giant flare hypothesis is to propose that η can vary wildly between different magnetars and even different bursts of the same magnetar. An FRB from a Galactic source then need not accompany a γ-ray flare, but this presents a problem of rates.

The estimate of the fraction of short γ-ray bursts (GRBs) that are consistent (temporally and spectrally) with being extragalactic magnetar giant flares is between 1% [\citep=ofek2007] to < 15% [\citep=nakar2006] -- see [\citet=hurley2011] for a review. The all-sky detection rate of short GRBs by Konus-W is [formula]. Thus, given the FRB sky rate of [formula] [\citep=rane2016], if FRBs and giant flares originate from the same magnetars, one expects that η will be very high (FRB-like) [formula] more often than very low (giant-flare-like); i.e. for every Galactic magnetar giant flare we have seen we should be detecting 400,000 bright radio bursts, detectable even in the sidelobes of telescopes, if we assume that the extragalactic magnetars behave similarly to Galactic magnetars.

Filtering and Mis-identification of Galactic FRBs?

A Galactic FRB, detected in the sidelobes of multi-feed telescopes such as Parkes and Arecibo, will likely have coincident detections in all feeds. Pulsar and transient surveys utilize the the multi-feed time streams to mask out near-field radio frequency interference (RFI), including perytons. The real-time FRB pipeline of the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at Parkes uses two FRB detection criteria that would rule out the detection of Galactic FRBs: (a) [formula] and (b) [formula], where [formula] is the Galactic DM contribution along the line of sight and [formula] is the number of beams (out of a total of 13) in which the burst is detected [\citep=petroff2015a]. The searches for Galactic bursts used an [formula] criteria [\citep=burkespolaor2011b]. The PALFA survey strategy is to subtract the feed-averaged zero DM time series for transient searches (Patel, C. et al, in preparation). This would significantly reduce the sensitivity of PALFA to low-DM Galactic FRBs.

Unlike 'perytons' however, Galactic FRBs would have a sharp ν- 2 dispersion sweep, but the DM would be within the Galactic limit. A single-beam radio telescope, without anti-coincidence filtering, may misidentify these bursts as candidate rotating radio transients [\citep=keane2015] in the pointing direction. A revised search of archival multi-feed data with filtering optimized for Galactic FRBs may set limits on the rate of occurence. Another feature of these sidelobe mis-identifications is that radio pulses classified as unconfirmed RRATs at different sky locations may appear to be clustered in DM space since they could originate from the same Galactic magnetar. A preliminary scan through the RRATalog for RRATs detected in only in single observations shows no obvious groupings, though a firm statistical analysis is complicated due to the heterogenous surveys that have contributed to the detections and is beyond the scope of this paper.

It is worth mentioning that Galactic FRBs, especially due to their enormous flux and small dispersion, would be detectable not only by astronomical telescopes but also by civilian and military radars, atmospheric monitoring experiments, ground-satellite communication links etc. That such a phenomenon has not yet been reported suggests to us it is unlikely to exist.

Magnetar Ages and Behavior

It could be that SGR 1806-  20 is a special case and that the 'typical' magnetars that produce FRBs have different characteristics. Indeed, SGR 1806-  20 is the youngest magnetar known, with a characteristic age of 240 yr [\citep=olausen2014] and a kinematic age of 650 yr [\citep=tendulkar2012], has the strongest B-field of all those known [\citep=kouveliotou1998] [\citep=woods2007], and the giant flare of 2004 December 27 was the most luminous of all three observed giant flares.

It is possible that a very young (<  < 100 yr, 'baby') magnetar may be extremely active in emitting energetic radio-bright, γ-ray faint bursts. As the magnetar ages, the repetition may slow and η may decrease to a point where the bursts are infrequent (<   once per decade) and radio faint. While this may explain the lack of a Galactic FRB, however, it also significantly reduces the number of extragalactic magnetars that are available to explain the FRB rate.

Another possibility is that η may be suppressed significantly by a strong B-field, implying an upper bound for the B-field of FRB sources. In such a case, we may expect the other, lower B-field, Galactic magnetars to produce Galactic FRBs, which again, would be detectable in sidelobes of telescopes.

Conclusion

From our non-detection of a prompt radio counterpart to the 2004 December 24 giant flare of SGR 1806-  20 for predicted scattering times, we have calculated an upper limit on the radio to γ-ray fluence ratio, [formula] and shown that it is inconsistent with ηFRB for fourteen of the fifteen FRB sources for which a lower limit on η is calculated from their non-detection in Fermi-GBM, Swift-BAT and Konus-WIND γ-ray instruments. We have thus ruled out the simple hypothesis that magnetar giant flares and FRBs are the prompt multi-wavelength counterparts of the same emission mechanism can be ruled out. We have discussed possible modifications to this hypothesis that may reconcile the two phenomena which are very similar in other aspects: rates, energetics, and timescales. We also point out that if this hypothesis holds, extremely bright Galactic FRBs would be detected in side-lobes of radio telescopes at rates [formula] times the rate of Galactic magnetar giant flares, an unlikely scenario.
