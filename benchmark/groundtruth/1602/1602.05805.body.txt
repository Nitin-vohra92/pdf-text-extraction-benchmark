Spectral properties of weighted composition operators on the Bloch and Dirichlet spaces

Introduction

The space of analytic functions on the open unit disk [formula] in the complex plane [formula] is denoted by [formula]. Every analytic selfmap [formula] of the unit disc induces a composition operator [formula] on [formula]. These operators have been studied for many decades starting from the papers of Littlewood, Hardy and Riesz in the beginning of the 20th century. For general information of composition operators on classical spaces of analytic functions the reader is referred to the excellent monographs by Cowen and MacCluer [\cite=4] and Shapiro [\cite=11]. In recent years this well-recognized theory has received new stimulus from the more general situation of linear weighted composition operators [formula], where [formula]. The main objective when studying the operators uCφ is to relate operator theoretic properties of uCφ to function theoretic properties of the inducing symbols φ and u.

This paper is devoted to the study of spectral properties of invertible weighted composition operators acting on the Bloch and Dirichlet spaces, defined in the preliminaries section below. The main references are the papers [\cite=3] by Chalendar, Gallardo-Gutiérrez and Partington, and [\cite=2] by Hyvärinen et al. In [\cite=2] the spectrum of weighted composition operators with automorphic symbols was extensively studied on spaces of analytic functions satisfying certain general conditions introduced in [\cite=2]. This class contains for example the weighted Bergman spaces and Hardy spaces. However, the Bloch and Dirichlet spaces are not in this class since the bounded analytic functions are not contained in the multipliers of these spaces. A new approach is thus needed, and found partly in [\cite=3], where the spectra of invertible weighted composition operators induced by parabolic and elliptic automorphisms on the Dirichlet space are completely described and the hyperbolic case is left as an open problem.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=28] we study the multipliers of the Bloch space, and obtain results similar to those in [\cite=3]. Section [\ref=29] is devoted to the spectral theory of invertible weighted composition operators uCφ acting on the Bloch space. In particular, we give a description of the spectrum when φ is a parabolic or elliptic automorphism of [formula]. In the case of hyperbolic φ, the spectral radius is computed and we obtain an inclusion of the spectrum in an annulus. Finally, in Section [\ref=30] we improve the recent estimates [\cite=3] by Chalendar, Gallardo-Gutiérrez and Partington of the spectrum of an invertible weighted composition operator on the Dirichlet space when φ is a hyperbolic automorphism of [formula].

Preliminaries

We begin by recalling some Banach spaces of analytic functions on the unit disc [formula]. The Bloch space B is the set of functions [formula] such that [formula], and is equipped with the norm

[formula]

The Dirichlet space D consists of functions [formula] such that [formula], where the Bergman space A2 is the set of analytic functions on [formula] such that

[formula]

with normalized Lebesgue measure dA(  ·  ) on [formula]. The Dirichlet norm is defined as

[formula]

Other spaces of analytic functions on the unit disc [formula] used in this paper are the disc algebra [formula], consisting of functions continuous on the closed unit disc, the weighted Banach spaces of analytic functions

[formula]

where 0  <  s  <    ∞   and vs(z)  =  (1  -  |z|2)s is the standard weight, and the space H∞ of bounded analytic functions on [formula] with supremum norm [formula]. The spectrum and spectral radius of an operator T:X  →  X on a space X are denoted respectively by σX(T) and rX(T). A good reference for operator theory in function spaces is the monograph [\cite=13] by Zhu.

When dealing with composition operators it is customary to denote the n-th iterate of a selfmap φ of [formula] by φn, that is with φ0 representing the identity map, and it is easy to check that This can also be stated as (uCφ)n  =  u(n)Cφn, where u(0): = 1 and It turns out that the spectral analysis of invertible weighted composition operators uCφ strongly depends on the type of the (necessarily) automorphic symbol φ. Recall that a nontrivial automorphism φ of [formula] is called elliptic if it has a unique fixed point in [formula], parabolic if φ has Denjoy-Wolf fixed point a in [formula] with φ'(a) = 1, and hyperbolic if φ has Denjoy-Wolf fixed point [formula] (the so-called attractive fixed point) with 0  <  φ'(a)  <  1 and a repulsive fixed point [formula] with φ'(b) = 1 / φ'(a) (see [\cite=4]). When computing the spectrum, we will make use of the formula

[formula]

which is valid for parabolic and hyperbolic automorphisms φ of [formula] with Denjoy-Wolf point a, see [\cite=4].

Multiplier spaces

In this section we consider the multiplier spaces and where X is either the Bloch space B or the Dirichlet space D, and the multiplication operator is defined in the obvious way Muf  =  uf. The main results of this section are Theorem [\ref=31], where we characterize those φ for which M(B,φ)  =  B, and Theorem [\ref=2] where we show that M(B,φ)  =  M(B) whenever φ is a finite Blaschke product. The Dirichlet space versions of the mentioned results are given in [\cite=3].

The multiplier space M(D) was characterized by Stegenga in [\cite=12] as the set of functions u∈H∞ such that the multiplication operator [formula] is bounded ([formula] being a Carleson measure for D). For the Bloch space it is known from [\cite=6] that a weighted composition operator uCφ:B  →  B is bounded if and only if the following two conditions hold:

[formula]

[formula]

From this follows that u∈M(B) if and only if

[formula]

[formula]

Condition ([\ref=26]) can also be related to a multiplication operator in a similar fashion as in the Dirichlet case:

If the function [formula] is analytic, then the multiplication operator [formula] is bounded if and only if condition holds.

If condition holds then

[formula]

where we used that every Bloch function f satisfies

[formula]

for some positive constant α independent of f. On the other hand, if the operator [formula] is bounded then there is a constant c  >  0 such that for every f∈B When this is applied to the Bloch functions [formula] for [formula], we obtain for every [formula], since [formula] for every [formula]. Now choose a  =  z and take supremum over [formula] to get ([\ref=26]).

Let φ be an analytic selfmap of [formula]. Then M(B,φ)  =  B if and only if

[formula] and

φ∈M(B).

Assume first that (1) and (2) hold and choose u∈B. Then so ([\ref=24]) holds. We also have that

[formula]

which is finite because u is a Bloch function (see ([\ref=8])) and φ∈M(B) (replace u with φ in ([\ref=26])). Thus ([\ref=25]) also holds, and so u∈M(B,φ), which shows that M(B,φ)  =  B (the inclusion M(B,φ)  ⊂  B being trivial).

Assume on the other hand that M(B,φ)  =  B, so that uCφ:B  →  B is bounded for every u∈B. This assumption ensures that if f∈B then [formula] for every u∈B, which means that the multiplication operator [formula] is well defined and hence bounded by the Closed Graph Theorem. Thus [formula], so that the composition operator Cφ:B  →  H∞ is well defined and bounded. Assume to reach a contradiction that [formula]. Choose a function [formula] such that [formula]. Since f is unbounded there is a sequence [formula], |ωn|  →  1-, such that |f(ωn)| > n for every [formula]. Since [formula], there is a sequence [formula] such that |φ(zn)|  =  |ωn| for n large enough, say n  ≥  n0. Now choose the sequence {θn}∞n = n0 so that ωn = eiθnφ(zn) and define fn(z): = f(eiθnz). Then [formula] for every n, but |Cφfn(zn)|  =  |fn(φ(zn))|  =  |f(ωn)|  >  n so that [formula]. This contradicts the boundedness of Cφ:B  →  H∞, so we must have [formula].

It remains to show that φ∈M(B). The boundedness of uCφ:B  →  B for every u∈B and ([\ref=25]) imply that for every u∈B. The operator [formula] is hence well defined and bounded. According to Lemma [\ref=20] this is equivalent to so φ∈M(B) and the proof is complete.

Assume that φ is a finite Blaschke product. Then M(B,φ)  =  M(B).

If u∈M(B) then Mu:B  →  B is bounded and hence uCφ  =  MuCφ:B  →  B is bounded, so that u∈M(B,φ) and M(B)  ⊂  M(B,φ). Assume on the other hand that u∈M(B,φ), so that uCφ:B  →  B is bounded and u∈B. Since φ is a finite Blaschke product we get from Lemma 1 in [\cite=5] that where N is the degree of the Blaschke product. Hence

[formula]

which is ([\ref=26]). It remains to show that u∈H∞, so let S be the finite supremum in ([\ref=25]). For every [formula] for which the derivative of φ is nonzero we have that Since φ is a finite Blaschke product, the derivative [formula] is analytic in an open neighborhood of the closed unit disc, is nonzero on the unit circle |z| = 1 and has only a finite number of zeros elsewhere. This implies that we can choose δ  >  0 so that [formula], which shows that u is bounded by [formula] on δ  ≤  |z|  <  1 and hence bounded on [formula]. Thus u∈M(B), so that M(B,φ)  ⊂  M(B), and hence M(B,φ)  =  M(B).

In the next sections we will study the spectrum of invertible weighted composition operators on the Bloch and Dirichlet spaces. The invertibility of weighted composition operators has been characterized on various spaces of functions by many authors, see for example [\cite=1] [\cite=8] [\cite=2]. The following result is a consequence of [\cite=1].

Assume that X is either the Bloch space B or the Dirichlet space D, and let uCφ:X  →  X be a bounded weighted composition operator on X. Then uCφ is invertible on X if and only if u∈M(X), u is bounded away from zero on [formula] and φ is an automorphism of [formula]. In such a case the inverse operator of uCφ:X  →  X is also a weighted composition operator, given by

Spectra on the Bloch space

In this section we study the spectrum of invertible weighted composition operators on the Bloch space. The investigation is divided into three cases, to cover parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic automorphisms. Our approach is based on the papers [\cite=3] and [\cite=2], but new ideas are still needed. The following lemma will be useful in the sequel.

If φ is an automorphism of [formula], then rB(Cφ)  =  1.

By [\cite=7] and [\cite=10] we have the following estimate of the composition operator norm for any automorphism φ of [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

where is the hyperbolic distance on [formula]. If φ(0)  =  0 then obviously rB(Cφ)  =  1. If on the other hand ϱ(φ(0),0)  ≠  0, then we obtain the following estimate from ([\ref=12]) for every [formula]:

[formula]

and since [formula] we conclude that rB(Cφ)  =  1.

The parabolic case

We begin by describing the spectrum of invertible weighted composition operators uCφ on the Bloch space induced by parabolic automorphisms φ, and for the proof we need the following result.

Suppose that φ is a parabolic automorphism of [formula] with unique fixed point [formula], and assume that [formula] is bounded away from zero on [formula]. Then

See the proof of [\cite=2].

Suppose that the weighted composition operator uCφ:B  →  B is invertible on the Bloch space and assume that the automorphism φ is parabolic, with unique fixed point [formula]. If [formula], then

We begin by showing that the spectrum is contained in the proposed circle of radius |u(a)|. According to Theorem [\ref=3], u belongs to M(B) and is bounded away from zero on [formula], from which follows that u(a)  ≠  0. Since rB(Cφ)  =  1 by Lemma [\ref=9] and (uCφ)n  =  u(n)Cφn  =  Mu(n)Cφn by Theorem [\ref=2], we only need to focus on the operator norm of Mu(n):B  →  B:

[formula]

where we used that [formula] if φ is an automorphism of [formula], and introduced the function ψ: = φ- 1 to simplify notation. Note that ψ is also a parabolic automorphism with fixed point a, and ψj  =  (φ- 1)j  =  φ- 1j. Furthermore,

[formula]

where the norm [formula] is finite since u∈M(B), as discussed in Lemma [\ref=20]. Now using inequality ([\ref=12]) and the fact that u is bounded away from zero on [formula], we obtain the following estimate of the operator norm of Mu(n):B  →  B:

[formula]

Applying this to the spectral radius and using Lemmas [\ref=9] and [\ref=21] gives

[formula]

Since [formula], by Theorem [\ref=3], where φ- 1 is a parabolic automorphism with unique fixed point a, the above result also shows that Now if λ∈σB(uCφ), then we also have that [formula]. From this follows that |λ|  ≤  rB(uCφ)  ≤  |u(a)| and [formula], so that |λ|  =  |u(a)|. Thus

[formula]

and obviously rB(uCφ)  =  |u(a)|.

In order to prove the reverse inclusion in ([\ref=7]), let λ be a complex number of modulus |λ|  =  |u(a)|  =  rB(uCφ). As in the proof of [\cite=2] it is then, by the Spectral Mapping Theorem, enough to show that which is done as follows. The sequence {zn}∞n = 0, defined by zn  =  φn(0), is interpolating for H∞ since φ is a parabolic automorphism (see the comment preceding [\cite=2]), so by the Open Mapping Theorem there is a constant c  >  0 and a sequence {fn}∞n = 0  ⊂  H∞ such that for all [formula] we have [formula] and

[formula]

Note that B  ⊂  H∞vs for every s  >  0, since if f∈B then by ([\ref=8]) Choose some s  >  0 and let so that [formula] for every f∈B. The interpolating sequence {fn}∞n = 0 satisfies [formula] for all [formula], which gives that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Furthermore,

[formula]

by ([\ref=35]), so

[formula]

where the function introduced in the proof of [\cite=2] satisfies In the same proof it was also shown that and mentioned that [formula]. Using the parabolic version of the limit ([\ref=11]), we see that

[formula]

Since rB(λ  -  uCφ)  ≥  2rB(uCφ), we get from the proof of [\cite=2] that -  λ∈σB(uCφ), which shows that and the proof is complete.

The hyperbolic case

In this subsection we investigate the spectrum of weighted composition operators uCφ:B  →  B generated by hyperbolic symbols φ. The results in this case are not complete. We obtain the spectral radius rB(uCφ) and thereby an inclusion of the spectrum in an annulus, which turns out to coincide with the spectrum under additional assumptions on the function u. The main result is given in Theorem [\ref=17].

Suppose that φ is a hyperbolic automorphism of [formula] with fixed points [formula], and assume that [formula] is bounded away from zero on [formula]. Then

See the proof of [\cite=2].

Suppose that the weighted composition operator uCφ:B  →  B is invertible on the Bloch space and assume that the automorphism φ is hyperbolic, with attractive fixed point [formula] and repulsive fixed point [formula]. If [formula], then rB(uCφ)   =    max {|u(a)|,|u(b)|} and

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=13], u belongs to M(B) and is bounded away from zero on [formula], so that u(a),u(b)  ≠  0. Since rB(Cφ)  =  1 by Lemma [\ref=9] and (uCφ)n  =  Mu(n)Cφn, it is again enough to consider the operator norm of Mu(n):B  →  B. Through identical calculations as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=13], observing that ψ: = φ- 1 is also a hyperbolic automorphism, we obtain the estimate

[formula]

and so by using Lemmas [\ref=9] and [\ref=22] one gets that

[formula]

On the other hand, [formula] by [\cite=9], so

[formula]

Letting n tend to infinity and observing that [formula] (by Lemma [\ref=9] since [formula]) we see that and thus Applying the above result to the inverse operator [formula], where φ- 1 is a hyperbolic automorphism with attractive fixed point b and repulsive fixed point a, we get that

[formula]

Now if λ∈σB(uCφ), then we also have that [formula], so that and which shows that the spectrum is contained in the claimed annulus.

In the case when |u(a)|  =  |u(b)| we are able to improve the previous theorem, to give a complete description of the spectrum. However, we were not able to compute the spectrum when |u(a)|  ≠  |u(b)|. It seems like one needs to consider the cases |u(a)|  <  |u(b)| and |u(a)|  >  |u(b)| separately, see for example [\cite=2].

Suppose that the weighted composition operator uCφ:B  →  B is invertible on the Bloch space and assume that the automorphism φ is hyperbolic, with attractive fixed point [formula] and repulsive fixed point [formula]. If [formula] and |u(a)| = |u(b)|, then

By Theorem [\ref=17] it suffices to prove that so let λ be a complex number of modulus |λ|  =  |u(a)|  =  rB(uCφ). As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=13] it is then enough to show that rB(λ  -  uCφ)  ≥  2rB(uCφ). This can be done exactly as in the previously mentioned proof since the sequence [formula], defined by zn  =  φn(0), is interpolating for H∞ by [\cite=4]. Using the same notation and performing the same calculations as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=13], we obtain the estimate Now since as in [\cite=2], this gives that

[formula]

where we used the limit ([\ref=11]) with [formula]. The inequality holds for every s  >  0 (see the latter part of the proof of Theorem [\ref=13]) so we may take limits as s  →  0 to obtain rB(λ  -  uCφ)  ≥  2rB(uCφ).

The elliptic case

We now turn to the spectrum of invertible weighted composition operators uCφ on the Bloch space when φ is an elliptic automorphism of [formula]. Though the methods of proof here are standard, some minor modifications are necessary and we thus present them.

If u∈M(B) and [formula], then [formula].

The function [formula] is bounded by assumption, so we only need to show that it satisfies condition ([\ref=26]):

[formula]

which is finite since u∈M(B).

Suppose that the weighted composition operator uCφ:B  →  B is bounded on the Bloch space and assume that [formula] and that φ is an elliptic automorphism, with unique fixed point [formula]. Then

either there is a positive integer j such that φj(z)  =  z for all [formula], in which case, if m is the smallest such integer, then

or φn  ≠   for every [formula], in which case, if uCφ:B  →  B is invertible, then

The proof of 1) is identical to the proof of [\cite=2], because as noted in [\cite=3] we can use the result of Lemma [\ref=18] to prove that The proof of 2) goes as in [\cite=2] and it relies on [\cite=2], which is also true for the Bloch space after a minor modification in the proof. Namely, it is assumed that φ(z)  =  μz, where μ  =  e2πθi and θ is irrational, [formula] and uCφ is invertible, and proven that [formula] by methods also valid for the Bloch space, except the one showing that

[formula]

Here A stands for a space satisfying conditions (C1), (C2) and (C3) as defined in [\cite=2]. However, by the same calculations used to prove Theorem [\ref=13] we get that

[formula]

and from this follows that

[formula]

where we used that [formula] by Lemma [\ref=9]. Thus ([\ref=19]) also holds for the Bloch space, and we can use the proof of [\cite=2] to obtain 2).

Spectra on the Dirichlet space

The spectra of invertible weighted composition operators induced by para-bolic and elliptic automorphisms on the Dirichlet space were completely described in [\cite=3]. In the hyperbolic case and under essentially the same assumptions as in Theorem [\ref=33] below, it was also shown in [\cite=3] that [formula] and

[formula]

where φ is conjugate to the automorphism

[formula]

for 0  <  μ  <  1. In Theorem [\ref=33] we improve this result to obtain an exact expression for the spectral radius.

[\cite=10] If φ is a univalent selfmap of [formula], then the spectral radius rD(Cφ)  =  1.

Suppose that the weighted composition operator uCφ:D  →  D is invertible on the Dirichlet space and assume that the automorphism φ is hyperbolic, with attractive fixed point [formula] and repulsive fixed point [formula]. If [formula], then rD(uCφ)   =    max {|u(a)|,|u(b)|} and

According to Theorem [\ref=3], u belongs to M(D) and is bounded away from zero on [formula], from which follows that u(a),u(b)  ≠  0. Since rD(Cφ)  =  1 by Lemma [\ref=23], we begin by estimating the operator norm of Mu(n):D  →  D:

[formula]

where we used the subadditivity of the square root function and the triangle inequality for the L2-norm. Now since we can continue the above estimation as follows:

[formula]

After substituting w  =  φj(z), the above integral takes the form

[formula]

where ψ: = φ- 1 and the norm [formula] is finite since u∈, see the section on multiplier spaces. In [\cite=10], Martn and Vukoti proved that for every [formula], which combined with the results above gives

[formula]

Applying this to the spectral radius and using Lemmas [\ref=22] and [\ref=23] gives

[formula]

On the other hand, by [\cite=9], we have that

[formula]

so letting n tend to infinity and observing that [formula] (by Lemma [\ref=23] since [formula]) we see that and thus The statement regarding the spectrum σD(uCφ) can now be justified exactly as in Theorem [\ref=17].

As already noted, we were not able to compute the spectrum of invertible weighted composition operators with hyperbolic symbols φ, neither for the Bloch nor the Dirichlet space, except when |u(a)|  =  |u(b)| in the Bloch case. However, the following conjecture seems plausible and we leave it as an open problem:

Suppose that the weighted composition operator uCφ:X  →  X is invertible on X, where X is either the Bloch space B or the Dirichlet space D, and assume that the automorphism φ is hyperbolic, with attractive fixed point [formula] and repulsive fixed point [formula]. If [formula], then
