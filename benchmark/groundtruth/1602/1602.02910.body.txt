Entanglement Chern Number of the Kane-Mele Model with Ferromagnetism

Symmetry enriches topological classification of material phases.[\cite=PhysRevB.76.045302] For free fermion systems, the fundamental symmetries, i.e., time-reversal symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry, and chiral symmetry, are essential to obtain the so-called periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors.[\cite=PhysRevB.78.195125] [\cite=PhysRevB.78.195424] [\cite=DOI:10.1063/1.3149495] [\cite=1367-2630-12-6-065010] The classification has been farther refined to include some crystalline point group symmetries.[\cite=PhysRevLett.106.106802] [\cite=PhysRevB.88.125129] [\cite=PhysRevB.90.165114] In some cases, the physical and intuitive construction of topologically nontrivial phases with higher symmetry is possible by assembling two or multiple copies of topologically nontrivial phases with lower symmetry so that the symmetry of the assembled system is restored. A typical example is a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator with time-reversal symmetry.[\cite=PhysRevLett.95.146802] [\cite=PhysRevLett.95.226801] Physically, it is constructed by making each spin subsystem (up and down) a quantum Hall state.[\cite=PhysRevLett.97.036808] [\cite=PhysRevB.75.121403] The point is that, even when the whole system has time-reversal symmetry, the symmetry is effectively broken and the Chern number is finite for each spin subspace.

The "entanglement" Chern number has recently been introduced to characterize various topological ground states [\cite=doi:10.7566/JPSJ.83.113705]. The entanglement Chern number is the Chern number[\cite=PhysRevLett.49.405] [\cite=PhysRevLett.61.2015] [\cite=PhysRevLett.71.3697] for the entanglement Hamiltonian, and the entanglement Hamiltonian is constructed by tracing out certain subspaces of a given system.[\cite=PhysRevB.84.195103] [\cite=PhysRevLett.113.106801] [\cite=doi:10.7566/JPSJ.84.043703] This means that the entanglement Chern number is suitable for analyzing the topological properties of a high-symmetry system composed of multiple copies of lower-symmetry systems. That is, we can focus on a specific subsystem by tracing out the others. For instance, if the up- or down- spin sector is chosen as a subspace to be traced out, the obtained entanglement Chern number, which we name as the entanglement spin Chern number, should be useful for characterizing the QSH state. It is worth noting that the choice of the subspace is not limited to spin sectors and that entanglement Chern number potentially has wide applications. Also, the entanglement Chern number can be defined regardless of the symmetry of the system or the details of the Hamiltonian provided we can choose a subsystem to be traced out.

In this paper, we first briefly explain the idea behind the entanglement (spin) Chern number. Then, we extend the arguments in Ref.  to cover the global phase diagram of the Kane-Mele model, which is a typical model for the QSH state. We also investigate the stability of the entanglement spin Chern number against time-reversal symmetry breaking by introducing the Zeeman term to the Kane-Mele model. It is found that the sum of the entanglement spin Chern numbers is equal to the Chern number in the entire phase space. In addition, in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit, a phase with a large (up to three) magnitude of the Chern number is shown to appear.

Let us first introduce the entanglement Chern number, which plays a key role in this paper. Briefly speaking, the entanglement Chern number is the Chern number for the entanglement Hamiltonian. In order to define the entanglement Hamiltonian, we divide a given system into two subsystems, say A and B. Then, the entanglement Hamiltonian for this partition, HA, is defined as [formula] with [formula], where |Ψ〉 and [formula] denote the ground-state wave function and the trace over subsystem B, respectively. The name "entanglement" Hamiltonian originates from the fact that information of the entanglement between A and B is encoded in ρA[\cite=PhysRevB.73.245115] or equivalently in HA.

In general, a given Hamiltonian [formula] and a correlation matrix [formula] are related as[\cite=0305-4470-36-14-101]

[formula]

Moreover, at zero temperature, the correlation matrix is explicitly written as

[formula]

where φn(i) is the eigenvector of H. Now, we define the restricted correlation matrix CA by projecting C to subsystem A. Namely, the elements of CA are taken from Cij with i and j in A. As in the general case of Eq. [\eqref=eq:HtoC], we have HTA  =   ln [(1  -  CA)  /  CA], which gives a convenient way to evaluate HA. In the following, we use the spectrum of CA to evaluate the spectrum of HA and call it the "entanglement spectrum".

When the considered partition into A and B retains the translation symmetry of the original model, the momentum [formula] also becomes a good quantum number for the entanglement Hamiltonian. Then, the matrix to be analyzed becomes

[formula]

where [formula] is the projection operator to the occupied bands defined using the Bloch wave function [formula] for nth band and PA is the projection operator to the subsystem A. In this case, we obtain a momentum-resolved entanglement Hamiltonian [formula] as [formula]. This relation means that [formula] is an eigenvector of HA if [formula] is an eigenvector of [formula]. Therefore, it is possible to define the (entanglement) Chern number by using the eigenvector [formula] of [formula], which is given as a solution of [formula]. The eigenvalues [formula] form a band structure, and the values of [formula] are restricted in the range
