Factoring groups into dense subsets

Introduction

For a cardinal κ, a topological space X is called κ-resolvable if X can be partitioned into κ dense subsets [\cite=b1]. In the case κ = 2, these spaces were defined by Hewitt [\cite=b4] as resolvable spaces. If X is not κ-resolvable then X is called κ-irresolvable.

In topological groups, the intensive study of resolvability was initiated by the following remarkable theorem of Comfort and van Mill [\cite=b2]: every countable non-discrete Abelian topological group G with finite subgroup B(G) of elements of order 2 is 2-resolvable. In fact [\cite=b11], every infinite Abelian group G with finite B(G) can be partitioned into ω subsets dense in every non-discrete group topology on G. On the other hand, under Martin's Axiom, the countable Boolean group G, G = B(G) admits maximal (hence, 2-irresolvable) group topology [\cite=b5]. Every non-discrete ω-irresolvable topological group G contains an open countable Boolean subgroup provided that G is Abelian [\cite=b6] or countable [\cite=b10], but the existence of non-discrete ω-irresolvable group topology on the countable Boolean group implies that there is a P-point in [formula] [\cite=b6]. Thus, in some models of ZFC (see [\cite=b8]), every non-discrete Abelian or countable topological group is ω-resolvable. For systematic exposition of resolvability in topological and left topological group see [\cite=b3].

Recently, a new kind resolvability of groups was introduced in [\cite=b7]. A group G provided with a topology T is called box κ-resolvable if there is a factorization G  =  AB such that |A| = κ and each subset aB is dense in T. If G is left topological (i.e. each left shift x  ↦  gx, g∈G is continuous) then this is equivalent to B is dense in T. We recall that a product AB of subsets of a group G is factorization if G = AB and the subsets {aB:a∈A} are pairwise disjoint (equivalently, each g∈G has the unique representation g = ab, a∈A, b∈B). For factorizations of groups into subsets see [\cite=b9]. By [\cite=b7], if a topological group G contains an injective convergent sequence then G is box ω-resolvable. This note is to find some conditions under which an infinite group G of cardinality κ provided with the topology could be factorized into two dense subsets of crdinality κ. To this goal, we propose a new method of factorization based on filtrations of groups.

Theorem and Question

We recall that a weight w(X) of a topological space X is the minimal cardinality of bases of the topology X.

We do not know whether Theorem is true for [formula] even if G is a topological group. In Comments, we give a positive answer in the following cases: each finitely generated subgroup of G is nowhere dense, the set {x2:x∈U} is infinite for each non-empty open subset of G, G is Abelian.

Proof

We begin with some general constructions of factorizations of a group G via filtrations of G.

Let G be a group with the identity e and let κ be a cardinal. A family {Gα:α  <  κ} of subgroups of G is called a filtration if

G0  =  {e}, [formula];

Gα  ⊂  Gβ for all α  <  β;

[formula] for every limit ordinal β.

Every ordinal α  <  κ has the unique representation α  =  γ(α) + n(α), where γ(α) is either limit ordinal or 0 and n(α)∈ω, [formula]. We partition κ into two subsets

[formula]

For each α∈E(κ), we choose some system Lα of representatives of left cosets of [formula] by Gα so [formula]. For each α∈O(κ), we choose some system Rα of representatives of right cosets of [formula] by Gα so [formula].

We take an arbitrary element [formula] and choose the smallest subgroup Gγ such that g∈Gγ. By (3), γ  =  α(g) + 1 so [formula]. If α(g)∈E(κ) then we choose x0(g)∈Lα(g) and g0∈Gα(g) such that g  =  x0(g)g0. If α(g)∈O(κ) then we choose y0(g)∈Rα(g) and g0∈Gα(g) such that g  =  g0y0(g). If g0  =  e, we make a stop. Otherwise we repeat the argument for g0 and so on. Since the set of ordinals <  κ is well ordered, after finite number of steps we get the representation

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If either [formula] or [formula] then we write [formula] or [formula]. Thus, G = AB where A is the set of all elements of the form [formula] and B is the set of all elements of the form [formula]. To show that the product AB is a factorization of G, we assume that, besides (4), g has a representation

[formula]

If [formula] and α∈O(κ) then [formula] so t0 = y0(g). If α∈E(κ) then [formula] so z0 = x0(g). We replace g to gt- 10 or to z- 10g respectively and repeat the same arguments.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem. Let {Uα:α  <  κ} be a κ-sequence of non-empty open sets such that each non-empty U∈T contains some Uα. Since |Uα| = κ for every α  <  κ, we can construct inductively a filtration {Gα:α  <  κ}, [formula] such that, for each α∈E(κ) (resp. α∈O(κ)) there is a system Lα (resp. Rα) of representatives of left (resp. right ) cosets of [formula] by Gα such that [formula] (resp. [formula]) for each γ  ≤  α. Then the subsets A,B of above factorization of G are dense in T because Lα  ⊂  A, Rβ  ⊂  B for each α∈E(κ), β∈O(κ).

Comments

1. Analyzing the proof, we see that Theorem holds under weaker condition: G has a family F of subsets such that |F|  =  κ, |F|  =  κ for each F∈F and, for every non-empty U∈T, there is F∈F such that F  ⊆  U.

If [formula] but each finitely generating subgroup of G is nowhere dense, we can choose a family {Gn:n∈ω} such that corresponding A,B are dense. Thus, we get a positive answer to Question if each finitely generated subgroup H of G is nowhere dense (equivalently the closure of H is not open).

2. Let G be a group and A,B be subsets of G. We say that the product AB is a partial factorization if the subsets {aB:a∈A} are pairwise disjoint (equivalently, {Ab:b∈B} are pairwise disjoint).

We assume that AB is a partial factorization of G into finite subsets and X be an infinite subset of G. Then the following statements are easily verified

there is x∈X such that x∉B and [formula] is a partial factorization;

if the set {x2:x∈X} is infinite then there is x∈X such that [formula] is a partial factorization.

3. Let G be a non-discrete Hausdorff topological group, AB be a partial factorization of G into finite subsets, A = A- 1, [formula] and g∉B. Then

there is a neighbourhood V of e such that, for [formula] and for any x∈U, the product [formula] is a partial factorization (so [formula]).

It suffices to choose V so that V = V- 1 and [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. We use A = A- 1 only in [formula].

4. Let G be countable non-discrete Hausdorff topological group such that {x2:x∈U} is infinite for every non-empty open subset U of G. We enumerate G = {gn:n∈ω}, g0  =  e and choose a countable base {Un:n∈ω} for non-empty open sets. We put A0  =  {e}, B0  =  {e} and use (5), (6), (7) to choose inductively two sequences (An)n∈ω and (Bn)n∈ω of finite subsets of G such that for every n∈ω An  ⊂  An + 1, Bn  ⊆  Bn + 1, An = A- 1n, AnBn is a partial factorization, gn∈AnBn, [formula], [formula]. We put [formula], [formula] and note that AB is a factorization of G into dense subsets.

5. Let G be a countable Abelian non-discrete Hausdorff topological group of countable weight. We suppose that G contains a non-discrete finitely generated subgroup H. Given any non-empty open subset U of G, we choose a neighborhood X of e in H and g∈S such that Xg  ⊂  U. Since H is finitely generated, the set {x2:x∈X} is infinite so we can apply comment 4. If each finitely generated subgroup of G is discrete then, to answer the Question we use comment 1.

6. Let G be a countable group endowed with a topology T of countable weight such that U is infinite for every U∈T. Applying the inductive construction from comment 5 to AnBn and B- 1n + 1A- 1n, we get a partial factorization of G into two dense subsets.

7. Let G be a group satisfying the assumption of Theorem and let γ be an infinite cardinal, γ  <  κ. We take a subgroup A of cardinality γ and choose inductively a dense set B of representatives of right cosets of G by A. Then we get a factorization G = AB. In particular, if G is left topological then G is box γ-resolvable.
