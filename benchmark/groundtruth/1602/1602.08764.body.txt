PTF Search for an Optical Counterpart to Gravitational Wave Trigger GW150914

Introduction

The direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) marks the dawn of a new era [\citep=GW150914-DETECTION]. It is widely agreed that the detection and study of the anticipated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts will vastly enrich the science returns for the field of GW astronomy. The photometric discovery of the EM counterpart will give a precise location and a spectrum of the host galaxy will give a precise redshift. This will enable a more accurate measurement of basic astrophysical properties such as the luminosity and energetics of this strong-field gravity event. If the spectrum is timely, it may also solve the long-standing mystery of the unknown sites of r-process nucleosynthesis.

The inherent challenge is that the two advanced GW interferometers, due to the low frequency of operation, give very poor on-sky localization [\citep=TwoDetectorsLocalization1] [\citep=TwoDetectorsLocalization2] [\citep=TwoDetectorsLocalization3] [\citep=TwoDetectorsLocalization4]. Nevertheless, the prospect of finding electromagnetic counterparts by searching large sky areas is promising as the search methodology is steadily improving -- from early efforts in the enhanced LIGO S6 run [\citep=S6opticalEM], to proof-of-concept localizations of coarse Fermi gamma-ray bursts [\citep=iPTF13bxl] [\citep=FermiPTF], to a score of EM facilities promptly responding to GW150914 [\citep=GW150914-EMFOLLOW].

At the time of the GW150914 trigger, there was no information disclosed on the nature of the event i.e. whether it was a binary black hole merger or binary neutron star merger or something else (GCN [\citetalias=GCN18330]). Many facilities undertook a search for an electromagnetic counterpart (e.g., [\citealt=gbm] [\citealt=swift] [\citealt=pspessto] [\citealt=decam]). Months later, after offline analysis, the event was identified as a binary black hole merger (GCN [\citetalias=GCN18858]).

Here, we present the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) follow-up effort. iPTF uses the Samuel Oschin 48-inch telescope on Palomar mountain equipped with the CFH12K camera with a field-of-view of 7.1 deg2 [\citep=lkd+09]. Our motivation was to look for an optical counterpart powered by free neutron decay ([\citealt=mbg+15]), or heavy element radioactive decay [\citep=kfm15] [\citep=mf14]. We describe the sky area coverage, candidate identification, spectroscopic classification and panchromatic follow-up. We conclude with our plans for a way forward.

Identifying Candidates

On UT 2015 September 16 03:17, the iPTF Target of Opportunity Marshal automatically responded to the gravitational wave trigger alert G184098 (later named GW150914). It immediately notified the team via phone calls and SMS alerts that there had been a GW trigger. It also computed that due to the sun angle constraint and elevation constraints, Palomar would only be able to access 2.5% of the enclosed probability by tiling 126 deg2 just before sunrise at high airmass (Figure [\ref=fig:localization]). This total area calculation takes into account the two non-working CCDs and the gaps between the CCDs. The small containment probability was because the southern mode of the updated ("LIB") localization was too far south to be observable from Palomar, whereas most of the northern mode rose only after 12 degree morning twilight. Clouds did not co-operate and the Palomar 48-inch dome remained closed the first night after trigger. However, the next night (UT Sep 17), we imaged 18 fields covering this area with exposures of 1 min (See details in Table [\ref=tab:obslog]; GCN [\citetalias=GCN18337]). The scheduling and choice of tiles was further optimized applying the algorithm described in [\citealt=iPTFScheduling]. A second epoch with a baseline separation of 30 min (±   1 min) was obtained for 13 fields.

Within minutes of obtaining the data, our automated real-time image subtraction pipeline started loading candidates into our database. We have two, independent real-time pipelines - one running at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) using the HOTPANTS image subtraction algorithm [\citep=nck15] and the other running at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) using the PTFIDE algorithm [\citep=masci16]. Due to the dynamic nature of the optical sky, the candidate list was dominated by false positive transients unrelated to the gravitational wave trigger. A total of 127676 candidates were loaded into the NERSC database and 32576 in the IPAC database. Our automated machine-learning-aided filtering algorithms rejected the moving objects in our solar system, variable stars in the Milky Way as well as subtraction artifacts. A list of 13 candidates were presented on a dynamic web portal for human vetting.

We have been refining our software algorithms that quickly sift through the large number of candidates during our Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor afterglow search effort [\citep=FermiPTF]. The EM-GW challenge has some similarities and some differences. The similarities are that we need to continue to reject foreground asteroids/variable stars and background supernovae/active galactic nuclei. The differences are that compared to a Gamma Ray Burst afterglow, the EM-GW counterpart may be relatively fainter and/or slower and/or redder. Knowing that the EM counterpart is relatively nearby due to the advanced LIGO sensitivity helps further reduce false positives.

The following are some rejection criteria:

Movement in detections in two epochs separated by at least 15 min suggesting the candidate is an asteroid

Past history of eruption in PTF/iPTF data (baseline of six years) suggesting the candidate is an old transient

Previously known radio source or X-ray source suggesting the candidate is an active galactic nucleus

Previously known optical or infrared point source underneath the position suggesting the candidate is a stellar flare

The following criteria lead to flags for follow-up spectroscopy, additional photometry and/or multi-band follow-up:

Host galaxy (within 100 kpc of transient) with spectroscopic redshift <  0.05 (or photometric redshift <  0.1) -- this is motivated by advanced LIGO's sensitivity limit to binary neutron star mergers

Photometric evolution on hour timescale (>  0.2 mag) or day timescale (>   0.5mag) or one-week timescale (>  1 mag) -- this serves as a strong discriminant against old supernovae. We note that this flag was not applied for GW150914 as all candidates of interest were spectroscopically classified within two hours.

Hostless candidates with no counterpart in deep iPTF reference co-adds -- even though these are unlikely to be local, we flag these events as they are relatively rare.

To quantify the relative efficacy of each criterion, we discuss the most severe cuts in order of severity by applying each criterion independently. Of the 127676 candidates in our NERSC pipeline, only 1007 candidates (0.8% selection) are selected as being coincident with a galaxy within 200 Mpc, hence this is the most severe cut. 5803 candidates (4.5%) are selected as passing our machine learning cuts (we now have three generations of machine learning algorithms; see details in [\citealt=umaa14] [\citealt=brink13]). 15624 candidates (12.2%) are selected as having two detections separated by 30in in the same night. 78951 candidates (62% selection) are selected as not having an optical point source in the reference image. Similarly, in our IPAC pipeline, we had a total of 32576 candidates. Of these, 24699 did not match a star (75.8% selection), 5302 had two detections (16.2% selection) and 1964 passed our machine learning cut (6.0% selection).

In practice, these criterion are not all applied simultaneously and the candidates selected for human vetting are the result of a more complex database query. For example, prior to human vetting, we do not require coincidence with a nearby galaxy and we do not require any light curve properties. For the five fields where a second epoch was not completed on the same night, we did a manual search requiring a local universe match, found 2 candidates that were both rejected as known asteroids. After human vetting of 13 candidates, 5 candidates were rejected as they showed past history of variability in the PTF data. In summary, our team flagged 8 candidates for further follow-up in our marshal database (see Table [\ref=tab:candidates]). Next, we describe the prompt follow-up that was undertaken to investigate whether any of the candidates was associated with GW150914 (GCN [\citetalias=GCN18341]).

Spectroscopic Follow-up

Since Hawaii is west of Palomar Observatory, sunrise was three hours later and we were able to obtain spectra of all eight candidates in less than 2 hours from discovery (Figure [\ref=fig:spec]). We emphasize that iPTF has routinely been obtaining spectroscopic classification on the same night as discovery, totaling 165 transients with spectra within 12 hours, thus far. We observed with the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS; [\citealt=deimos]) mounted on the Keck II telescope. We used the low resolution 600 ZD grating, giving spectral coverage between 4650Å  and 9600Å  with a resolution of 3.5Å  (full width at half maximum). Our spectra are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:spec]. A priori, since we searched 126 deg2 to a depth of 20.5 mag, we expect ≈  3.2 supernovae using the rates in [\citealt=li11] (and assuming that supernovae are brighter than -  17 mag for 1 month i.e. a volume out to z=0.075).

We cross-matched our spectra with a library of supernovae spectra augmenting the superfit software [\citep=superfit]. Our classifications are in Table [\ref=tab:candidates]. We found two Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), two hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae (SN II), three nuclear candidates (e.g. weak AGN where the spectrum is dominated by the host galaxy), and one hostless transient with initially unclear classification (iPTF15cyk). Offline processing of the three nuclear candidates also shows past history of photometric variability in the PTF data, which is consistent with the AGN hypothesis. The spectrum of iPTF15cyk was dominated by a blue continuum, with narrow lines suggesting a redshift of 0.539 (which would imply a very luminous transient). Since the nature of the GW source was unclear, we decided to obtain additional spectroscopic and multi-wavelength follow-up.

Radio and X-ray Follow-up

We observed iPTF15cyk and the necessary calibrators with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA; [\citealt=perley09]) in its D and DnC configurations. The observations were performed in C-band (≈  6 GHz central frequency) under our Target of Opportunity program (VLA/15A-339; PI: Corsi). VLA data were reduced and imaged using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. In Table [\ref=tab:15cyk], we report the 3σ upper-limits derived for iPTF15cyk using the full 2 GHz bandwidth (GCN [\citetalias=GCN18914]).

If the host galaxy redshift was confirmed, iPTF15cyk could be a super luminous supernova (SLSN) with absolute magnitude brighter than -  22 mag. Radio and X-ray emission from super luminous SNe may arise from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM; see e.g. [\citealt=ofc+13]). In an alternate model, superluminous supernovae could be powered by the spin-down of a nascent magnetar inside the supernova ejecta [\citep=kb10], which may also produce X-ray emission [\citep=mvb14].

However, such emission is likely to be very sensitive to the exact properties of the CSM including density profile and homogeneity. In dense CSM environments, free-free absorption can suppress the radio emission at early times. Thus, chances for a detection are maximized by observing after maximum light [\citep=ofc+13]. Hence, we observed iPTF15cyk thrice between 1 month and 4 months after discovery.

We also observed the location of iPTF15cyk with the Swift satellite [\citep=gcg+04] beginning at 18:12 UT on 2015 September 18 (Δt  =  4.3 d after the GW trigger). We do not detect any emission with the on-board X-Ray Telescope (XRT; [\citealt=bhn+05]) to a 3σ limit of <  3.2  ×  10- 3 ct s- 1. Assuming a power-law spectrum with a photon index of Γ  =  2, this corresponds to an upper limit on the unabsorbed flux (0.3-10.0 keV) of fX  <  1.3  ×  10- 13 erg cm- 2 s- 1.

Simultaneously we obtained images of the field with the Ultra-Violet Optical Telescope (UVOT; [\citealt=rkm+05]) on-board Swift in the V, B, U, UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 filters. No emission is detected at the location of iPTF15cyk. For a 3 aperture we place the following magnitude limits (AB system) at this time: V  >  19.29; B  >  19.81; U  >  20.62; UVW1  >  21.61; UVM2  >  22.27; and UVW2  >  22.42. These limits were derived using the revised UV zero points and time-dependent sensitivity from [\citet=blh+11].

Additional spectroscopic follow-up of iPTF15cyk showed that it was a hydrogen-poor super luminous supernova (SLSN I; [\citealt=quimby]) at z=0.539 (Figure [\ref=fig:15cyk]), similar to LSQ12dlf at +16 d [\citep=lsq12dlf]. The radio and X-ray upper limits were consistent with this classification. Given the high redshift, we concluded that this event was unrelated to GW150914. We note that the odds of finding a super luminous supernova were lower than the odds of finding other core-collapse or thermonuclear supernovae. The snapshot rate is only ~  0.2 using the volumetric rate in [\citealt=quimby13] (and assuming that SLSN are brighter than -  21 mag for 1 month). Moreover, we have a total of only 6 events with z>  0.5 (out of 2650 spectroscopically classified supernovae) in the six years of operating PTF/iPTF.

A Way Forward

The post-detection era promises to be one of routine GW detections of binary neutron star mergers. With routine detections, the joint probability of [formula] that the sun ([formula]), clouds ([formula]), and latitude ([formula]) simultaneously co-operate to identify the optical counterpart is not discouraging. Furthermore, given the location of Palomar Observatory in Southern California, relative to the location of the advanced LIGO interferometers, the time lag to respond is inherently less than an hour as we do not need to wait for the earth to rotate [\citep=TwoDetectorsLocalization1]. Most of the GW150914 localization was not accessible from the Northern night sky. But, based on our simulations [\citep=TwoDetectorsLocalization2], iPTF would include the true position of the GW source for an average of ≈  1 out of 2 events assuming a total of 100 iPTF observations (see Figure [\ref=fig:sim]; each observation is two 60 s exposures of 7.1 deg2).

As advanced LIGO ramps up in GW sensitivity, we are undertaking both hardware and software upgrades to improve EM sensitivity. In 2017, we plan to commission the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; [\citealt=k12] [\citealt=b14]), a 47 deg2 camera on the Palomar 48-inch, with a twelve times higher volumetric survey speed than iPTF. This increase in survey speed enables a faster cadence and deeper search for the optical counterpart (e.g., 22 mag in 10 min). The larger field-of-view may also be more robust to a shifting localization (e.g. for GW150914, our enclosed probability went from 2.5% in the initial map to 0.2% in the final map; see [\citealt=GW150914-EMFOLLOW]). We are continuing to improve our software algorithms, e.g., better candidate filtering, image co-addition and more optimal image subtraction [\citep=zog16]. We are continuing to complete our census of the local universe (CLU; Cook et al. in prep) as this 200 Mpc galaxy catalog serves as the most severe filter for false positives (see examples in [\citealt=nkg13]).

Among the various models for electromagnetic emission from binary neutron star mergers, free neutron decay gives the most luminous optical counterpart (Figure [\ref=fig:neutrons]; [\citealt=mbg+15]). Varying free neutron mass and opacity suggests that this counterpart may fade quickly, as much as 4 mag in 24 hours. Thus, we are also systematizing our follow-up with the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) program. The combination of a longitudinally distributed network of telescopes as well as multi-wavelength follow-up (VLA and Swift) should effectively filter candidates on a 24 hour timescale. Obtaining a timely light curve, spectra and spectral energy distribution will unravel both the astrophysics and the astrochemistry of the EM counterpart. With this first gravitational wave detection, the 21st century gold rush [\citep=k13] has officially begun!
