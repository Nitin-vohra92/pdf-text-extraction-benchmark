Sensitivity study for s process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars

Introduction

In the solar system about half of the elements heavier than iron are produced by the slow neutron capture process, or s process [\cite=AKW99b]. The s process is a sequence of neutron capture reactions on stable nuclei until an unstable isotope is produced, which usually decays via a β- decay to the element with the next higher proton number. This chain of neutron captures and beta decays will continue along the valley of stability up to 209Bi [\cite=KGB11]. The signature of the s process contribution to the solar abundances suggests a main, a weak and a strong component. While the main component is responsible for the atomic mass region from 90 to 209, the weak component contributes to the mass region between 60 and 90. Finally, the strong component is required for the production of lead. The main and strong component is made by low mass stars with [formula] at different metallicities, whereas the weak component is related to massive stars with [formula] ([formula] stands for the solar mass) [\cite=PGH10]. According to our current understanding of the main s process component, two alternating stellar burnings create environments with neutron densities of 106 - 7 cm- 3 and 1011 - 12 cm- 3. The corresponding neutron sources are the 13C(α,n)16O and the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction. These reactions are activated in low-mass Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (AGB stars) [\cite=LHL03]. AGB stars are characterized by alternating hydrogen shell burning and helium shell burning after the formation of a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.

In this paper, we provide a complete sensitivity study for the final, most important pulse and the preceding 13C-pocket computed for the stellar model of a [formula] star with metallicity Z = 0.02.

s-process

The production site for the main s process component is located in thermally pulsing AGB stars, which is an advanced burning phase of low mass stars, where the core consists of degenerate oxygen and carbon and the helium inter-shell and the hydrogen envelope burn alternately.

During the AGB evolution phase, the s process is mainly activated in the radiative 13C-pocket by the 13C(α,n)16O reaction. After a thermal pulse (TP, [\cite=ScH65]), the shell H burning is not efficient and H-rich material from the envelope is mixed down in the He intershell region by the so called Third Dredge Up (TDU, [\cite=IbR83]). Convective boundary mixing (CBM) processes leave a decreasing abundance profile of protons below the bottom of the TDU. Protons are then captured by the He burning product 12C and converted to 13C via the channel 12C(p,γ)13N(β+)13C. Therefore, a 13C-rich radiative layer is formed, where the 13C(α,n)16O reaction is activated before the occurrence of the next convective TP, at temperatures around 0.1 GK and with neutron densities between 106 and 107 cm- 3. In particular, the 13C-pocket is the region where 13C is more abundant than the neutron poison 14N (for recent reviews, see [\cite=Her05] [\cite=SGC06]).

A smaller contribution to the s process economy is given by the partial activation of the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction, during the convective TP. The neutron source 22Ne produces only a few per cent of all the neutrons made by the 13C(α,n)16O in the 13C-pocket, but it is activated at higher temperatures resulting in a higher neutron density (around 1010 cm- 3). This affects the s-process abundance distribution for several isotopes along the s-process path (e.g. [\cite=GAB98] [\cite=LHL03]). The most sensitive isotopes to the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg contribution are located at the branch points.

Branch points

Branch points are unstable nuclei along the s-process path with a life time comparable to the neutron capture time. The average neutron capture time for the s process depends on the isotope's (n,γ) cross section and the neutron density. It is around 10 years during the 13C phase. If the s-process path reaches such a nucleus, the path will split into two branches, with some of the mass flow following the β decay and the rest of the mass flow following the neutron capture branch. The branching itself is very sensitive to the neutron capture time, hence the neutron density and the (n,γ) cross section. With increased neutron density, the neutron capture will become more likely and the beta decay less frequent and vice versa.

Nuclear Network

MACS

For exact simulations it is essential to know the precise probability that a given reaction will take place. Taking into account the Maxwell-Boltzmann-distribution of the neutrons in stars, the cross sections can be calculated by

[formula]

where 〈σ〉 is the Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). 〈σv〉 is the integrated cross section σ over the velocity distribution Φ(v) and

[formula]

with m the reduced mass of the reaction partners.

Rates

The reaction rate gives the change of abundance per unit time for one nucleus X reacting with a particle Y. These rates, essential for the nucleosynthesis simulations, can be calculated by

[formula]

where Nx and Ny is the number of nuclei X and Y per unit volume. The change of abundance per time is given by

[formula]

Measuring exact values of the MACS and reaction rates can be quite difficult. There are still rates that have only been estimated theoretically.

Sensitivity studies

Since some crucial rates (e.g. 85Kr(n,γ) [\cite=RTR13]) along the s-process path are not known to sufficient precision, predictions based on rates have significant uncertainties [\cite=RLK14]. In order to account for these uncertainties in isotopic abundances, it is essential to know the influence of these reactions on the resulting abundances. The sensitivity gives the coupling between the change in the rate and the change in the final abundance:

[formula]

The sensitivity sij is the ratio of the relative change in abundance ΔNj  /  Nj of isotope j and the relative change of the rate Δri  /  ri. In order to extract the sensitivity of a certain rate, simulations with a change in this rate are compared with the default run. A positive sensitivty means that an increase in the rate results in an increase of the final abundance, whereas a negative sensitivity will decrease the final abundance with an increased rate. In this paper, we distinguish between global sensitivities, which affect the overall neutron density, and local sensitivities, which affect the s-process path in the vicinity of the nuclei under study.

NuGrid

The NuGrid collaboration provided a [formula] and Z = 0.02 stellar model and the tools to post-process this model for this study. The stellar model was calculated with the MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) code and post-processed with MPPNP (Multizone Post Processing Network Parallel) the multi-zone driver of the PPN (Post Processing Network) code.

For the sensitivity studies of the TP we recalculated in MPPNP all cycles of the last TP of the stellar model with changed nuclear network settings.

For the sensitivity studies of the radiative 13C-pocket we extracted a trajectory at the center of the 13C-pocket layers. Consistent initial abundances have been adopted for the simulations.

The network data in the PPN physics package is taken from a broad range of single rates and widely used reaction compilations. Focusing on charged-particle-induced reactions on stable isotopes in the mass range A  =  1-28, the NACRE compilation [\cite=AAR99] covers the main part of these reactions. Proton-capture rates from Iliadis et al. [\cite=IDS01] in the mass range 20-40 are also included. Neutron capture reaction rates are used from the KADoNiS project [\cite=DHK06], which combines the rates from earlier compilations of e.g. Bao et al. [\cite=BBK00]. Beta-decay rates for unstable isotopes are taken from [\cite=FFN85] [\cite=OHM94] [\cite=LaM00]. Further rates are taken from the Basel REACLIB compilation. All reactions build up a reaction network of 14020 n-capture, charged particle and decay reactions. Within the MPPNP code a radial grid is used as the existing network is solved at each grid point. The size of the network is dynamically adapted depending on the conditions at each grid point. Calculations for mixing and nucleosynthesis are done with an implicit Newton-Raphson solver in operator split mode [\cite=HDF08].

Simulations

With two single-zone trajectories at the bottom of the TP and the center of the 13C-pocket we checked for the importance of each rate by changing it in the network. Those showing an impact during the thermal pulse were recalculated with multiple zones and an increase and decrease of the rates by 10%. For the 13C-pocket all reactions were simulated with an increase and decrease of the rates by 5% and by 20%. In this regime the sensitivity is constant, hence the sensitivities for changes of 10% were averaged and tabulated.

Extensive simulations showed that the individual sensitivities of selected rates within each thermal pulse and 13C-pocket do not change significantly over the pulse history of the star. These results justify the assumption that the sensitivities extracted from a single event are representative for reoccurring events of the same type.

Results

General sensitivity study

In this part of our analysis we identified all rates with a global effect on the s-process abundances for the thermal pulse and the 13C-pocket and listed them in tables [\ref=tab:TPglob] and [\ref=tab:C13glob]. Furthermore, the three strongest rates that affect individual isotopes (averaged results for changes of ±  10%) are listed in the online version of the full manuscript [\cite=KTG16]. Only sensitivities greater than ±  0.1 are reported there.

Those rates which have a global impact on the s-process abundances were differentiated into neutron donators, neutron poisons and competing captures.

Neutron donators are reactions, which either set neutrons free for the s process or produce isotopes that ultimately set neutrons free. For example, the 13C(α,n) reaction is a direct neutron donator whereas the 12C(p,γ) reaction is an indirect neutron donator, since it leads to the production of the direct neutron donator 13C. A neutron donator is shown in figure [\ref=fig:donator].

Neutron poisons are light isotopes with a sufficiently large neutron capture cross section to impact the neutron density or reactions, which produce these isotopes, or reactions, which compete with the neutron donator reactions. A neutron poison, which acts in all three ways, is, for example, the 14N(n,p) reaction, which not only consumes neutrons, but also produces protons, which will eventually compete with the 13C(α,n) reaction via the 13C(p,γ) reaction, which leads furthermore to the production of more 14N. Another example for a competing reaction acting as neutron poison is the 14C(α,γ) reaction as it requires α particles, which are crucial for the neutron source 13C(α,n). A neutron poison is shown in figure [\ref=fig:poison].

Competing captures are isotopes on the s-process path, which have a large neutron capture cross section or are abundant enough to affect the overall s-process evolution, which can be observed on many neutron magic isotopes. An example is the 56Fe(n,γ) reaction, which supports the s process but impacts the amount of neutrons per seed, which shifts the peak in the production of isotopes from higher to lower mass numbers. A competing capture is demonstrated in figure [\ref=fig:competing].

Local sensitivities are rates, which influence the production or depletion of isotopes in their neighborhood on the chart of nuclides. A locally sensitive rate is demonstrated in figure [\ref=fig:local_sens].

Kr sensitivities and uncertainties

Here we demonstrate in a detailed way how to use the sensitivity in order to calculate the impact of the nuclear uncertainties on the isotopic abundances. We focus on the sensitivity of 86Kr and 84Kr, which is affected by the branch point 85Kr, with a β-decay half-life of about 10 years [\cite=RTR13] [\cite=BBK00] [\cite=ABG01]. The aim is to find all affecting global and local nuclear rates for the Kr isotopes and the impact of their uncertainties on the isotopic ratio, which can also be observed in presolar grains [\cite=PGA06] [\cite=LAA94]. Kr is of special interest since it can be measured in laboratories in presolar grains, condensed around old carbon-rich AGB stars before the formation of the solar system. From their analysis it is possible to measure isotopic abundances for s-process elements with high accuracy.

After detecting all globally and locally affecting rates for the stable Kr isotopes during the TP and 13C-pocket (tables [\ref=tab:Kr80], [\ref=tab:Kr82], [\ref=tab:Kr83], [\ref=tab:Kr84], [\ref=tab:Kr86]), we used these sensitivities to calculate uncertainties of the predicted Kr abundances resulting from uncertainties of the reaction rates, table [\ref=tab:uncer]. No sensitivities smaller than ±  0.1 in the 13C-pocket or the thermal pulse are listed.

With the obtained sensitivities for the Kr isotopes one can calculate the uncertainties ΔNj in the final abundance based on the recommended uncertainties of the rates Δri with:

[formula]

The largest contribution to the final uncertainty can be obtained with:

[formula]

The overall uncertainties are listed in tables [\ref=tab:uncer:13C] and [\ref=tab:uncer:TP]. Note that despite significant experimental progress in determining neutron capture cross sections directly [\cite=RBA04] [\cite=RCH09] [\cite=WCG15] or indirectly [\cite=RTR13], the by-far biggest contribution to the overall uncertainty comes from the neutron capture cross section on the unstable 85Kr. Current facilities are almost in the position to measure this cross section with sufficient accuracy [\cite=CoR07]. Further developments are necessary to measure cross sections on isotopes with even shorter half-lives [\cite=RHH04] [\cite=ReL14].

Conclusions

Because of the different conditions during the inter-pulse phase and the thermal pulse, only few rates have an impact in both conditions: 22Ne(α,n), 56Fe(n,γ), 58Fe(n,γ), 140Ce(n,γ), 142Nd(n,γ). Neutron poisons mostly affect the abundances produced in long-lived neutron-poor environments like the inter-pulse phase and are not important during short periods with higher neutron densities as in the convective thermal pulse.

14N is the strongest neutron poison in the 13C-pocket. Competing neutron captures on the s process path decrease the production of isotopes with large mass numbers on the chart of nuclides, as seen in the case 56Fe, 58Fe and 64Ni. For the TP the most important rates, which affect the neutron density globally, are the neutron source 22Ne(α,n) and the neutron poison 25Mg.
