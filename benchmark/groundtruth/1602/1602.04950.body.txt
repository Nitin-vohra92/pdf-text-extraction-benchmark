Deviations in expected price impact for small transaction volumes under fee restructuring

Introduction

Large market orders submitted to electronic trading platforms have the tendency to deplete more than the inventory available at the best bid/offer level at time of sale. This provides a mechanistic account for change in prevailing asset prices. Observation of this phenomenon has translated to various views on the definition and estimation of the impact of a single transaction as a component of transaction cost, where the latter includes easily measurable fees and commissions as well as indirect levies such as the component of price impact.

With trade volumes increasing 10-fold in developed markets through the 1990's, it became possible to quantify regularities in price response to establish the relationship between averaged price shifts and transaction volumes [\cite=Lillo2003] [\cite=Iori2003] [\cite=Potters2003] [\cite=Plerou2004] [\cite=Farmer2004] [\cite=Zawadowski2004] [\cite=BGPW2004] [\cite=Moro2009] [\cite=Gatheral2009] [\cite=Wilinski2013]. This has led to a more refined but heuristic definition of price impact as the correlation between trade size and direction and the resultant price change.

In a study of 1000 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange for 1995-1998, it was determined that inclusion of an adjustment for the liquidity variation for stocks in different market capitalisation classes provided a calibration of a single representative price impact function for the entire market [\cite=Lillo2003].

Measuring by market capitalisation, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is one of the top 20 stock exchanges in the world, where current JSE market capitalisation of 1 trillion USD is approximately 1 / 20 of the NYSE. After being located in London since 2001, the JSE trade infrastructure was repatriated in July 2012 [\cite=JSE:MilleniumITGoLiveNotice2012]. In September 2013, an overhaul of the JSE transaction billing system resulted in the dramatic reduction of transaction costs [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketBillingModelChangeNotice2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2014v1a]. In particular, a minimum fee of 4.00 ZAR per trade (excl. VAT) was eliminated so that all transaction fees were reduced to pro rata amounts, depending linearly on transaction value (up until a capped maximum charge of 300 ZAR (excl. VAT)) [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketBillingModelChangeNotice2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2014v1a].

provides a timeline of a range of market microstructure events since Jan-2010 [\cite=JSE:MilleniumITGoLiveNotice2012] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketBillingModelChangeNotice2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2014v1a] [\cite=JSE:ColocationGoesLive2014] [\cite=JSE:ColocationBrochure2014]. As anticipated, the billing model change has corresponded to measurable changes to the JSE market microstructure. In this investigation we report the effect of the fee change on the price impact curves for 2013. Market microstructure and price response for stocks listed on the JSE in 2011 were investigated in [\cite=Dupreez] and optimal order execution on the JSE to minimise indirect costs was investigated in [\cite=Hendricks2014].

The asymmetrical impact of buyer and seller initiated transactions and the effect of transaction duration on impact is investigated in [\cite=Yang2011].

Our analysis highlights that the regulatory effect of direct transaction costs are coupled to nonlinear sensitivities in price impact of trade. In a different study [\cite=Malinova2011], it was found that the introduction of liquidity rebates on the Toronto Stock Exchange did not cause a decrease in trading costs for market orders but did result in a revenue increase for liquidity providers. The capacity to measure such feedbacks supports risk measurement and the reduction of some investor uncertainty from a market microstructure perspective.

The paper is structured as follows: in  we give a brief review of the price impact master curve conjecture which is tested in this paper for the three major sectors of the JSE Top 40. Data and curve construction are reviewed in , results are documented in  and we conclude with remarks on implications.

Price impact

Several studies have scrutinised components of price impact, where the latter includes both permanent and transient components, and comprehensive reviews are included in [\cite=Farmer2004] [\cite=BGPW2004] [\cite=Moro2009] [\cite=Gatheral2009] [\cite=Wilinski2013]. A reasonable point of departure is the identification of the following very general relationship [\cite=Potters2003]: price impact quantifies how a transaction of a given volume affects the price.

Lillo et al. [\cite=Lillo2003] focus on the relationship between transaction volume and the immediate price increment which follows. Letting p(t) be the logarithm of the midquote price, the impact of a transaction occurring at time t is defined as the increment:

[formula]

where ω denotes transaction size in number of shares and λ denotes a liquidity parameter.

In that investigation [\cite=Lillo2003] the quantity C0.4 was found to be a good proxy for liquidity, where C denotes the average market capitalisation. To obtain a general representation of the price impact function, the following price law was conjectured:

[formula]

Data and curve construction

This investigation is based on Thompson Reuters Tick History trades and quotes data for the JSE Top 40 stocks for the period 01-Jan-2013 to 31-Dec-2013.

The constituents of the JSE Top 40 were grouped according to the SA sector classification into three sectors: Resources (JSE-RESI), Industrials (JSE-INDI) and Financials (JSE-FINI). Price impact curves were computed for:

the period prior to the billing model change: 01-Jan-2013 (Tuesday) to 27-Sep-2013 (Friday)  [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2013],

the period post the billing model change: 30-Sep-2013 (Monday) to 31-Dec-2013 (Tuesday)  [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketBillingModelChangeNotice2013] [\cite=JSE:EquityMarketPriceList2014v1a].

The data was filtered to exclude price formation during auction periods and the more volatile 10-minute periods at commencement of regular trade (09h00-09h10) and before the closing auction (16h50-17h00), as well as nonsensical records such as trades and quotes with zero volume or zero price.

To facilitate the identification of the associated midquote price response to a trade of size ω, all trade events that had the same date-time stamp were aggregated into single events by computing volume weighted average prices (VWAP) and cumulative volumes. For quote events that had the same date-time stamp the last quote was used. The impact of trade direction was taken into account by partitioning the data into buyer and seller initiated trades. Since most limit order book data does not include information regarding trade direction, the Lee-Ready [\cite=LeeReady1991] algorithm was adopted to infer this.

For each trade record occurring at time tk, the associated price shift Δp(tk) is computed as in Lillo et al. [\cite=Lillo2003] where p(tk) and p(tk - 1) are respectively the log-midquote price immediately prior and immediately after the trade event. This change in the log-midquote price quantifies immediate price response to a trade of volume ω(tk).

To facilitate comparison between stocks the volumes were normalised by dividing through by the average volume of each stock.

Next, trade records [formula] for each time tk were binned according to normalised trade volume by constructing 20 logarithmically spaced bins between the normalised trade volumes of 10- 3.2 and 10. For each volume-bin, the average price impact [formula] and average normalised volume [formula] were computed. Results were plotted on a log-log scale.

Results

provide investigation outcomes of price impact relationships for buyer and seller initiated transactions of the three major sectors in the JSE for the two periods 01-Jan-2013 to 27-Sep-2013 and 01-Oct-2013 to 31-Dec-2013. In particular,  show the collapse of the individual price impact curves using the conjectured price law of Lillo et al. [\cite=Lillo2003] but where average daily value traded over the respective period is used as the proxy for liquidity.

By inspection and taking into account the different ranges for the volume axes, there is a discernible difference in the price impact of small trades in the Financials index between the two periods.

provides closer inspection of the price impact of trades from the financial sector. Here one can see that change in the log-midquote price for trades with normalised volume below 10- 1 units have increased from the first to the second period, where average increments for smaller trades increased to values above 10- 3.8 for the most part.

Outcomes for similar comparisons of the two date ranges for the Resources and Industrials sectors are presented in , respectively. For these sectors there were no significant changes in price impact behaviour before and after the fee restructuring.

To confirm the conjectured power-law hypothesis, we employed the maximum-likelihood estimation procedure developed by [\cite=CSN2007].  includes plots of the log-midquote increments vs normalised log-volumes, where the figures include details of the computed α exponents and p-values. With the null-hypothesis assumption of a power-law relationship, outcomes with p-values greater than 0.1 supported the power-law conjecture for all trading activity covered in our analysis. Thus, our results confirm some agreement with the master curve hypothesis of Lillo et al. [\cite=Lillo2003] [\cite=Farmer2004].

Increases in the α exponents were observed across all three sectors for both buyer and seller initiated trades after the fee restructuring. In 4 of the 6 cases an increase in xmin was also observed. However, variation in the α exponents between sectors imply that the market does not exhibit a universal price impact relationship as was uncovered in [\cite=Lillo2003]. The change in the parameters of statistically significant power-law fits before and after the billing model change suggest a structural change in price impact that may be attributed to the billing model change. Deviation in the expected linear relationship between log-midquote increments and normalised volumes for financial stocks in our study are consistent with the findings of [\cite=LC2004] [\cite=Zhou2012] [\cite=Wilinski2013], respectively for stocks listed on the Australian stock exchange between 2001 and 2004, for 40 constituent stocks in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index for 2003 and for 6 liquid stocks listed on the FTSE for November 2011 to March 2012. Conditions for the anomaly are proposed in [\cite=Zhou2012]: the condition is derived from proportion of filled trades in small-volume bins under the constraint that the Shenzhen market permits only trade volumes in integer multiples of 100. This condition is not applicable for the JSE and an explanation for the anomaly remains an open problem.

Conclusion

We investigated the nature of price impact of electronic trading of share prices in an emerging economy, with attention to change in market microstructure through transaction fee restructuring. For the three major sectors studied we confirmed:

the existence of a power-law relationship between price increment and trade size and

that the relationship was not changed significantly by reduction of transaction costs for the period under investigation.

We detected a discernible anomaly in the price impact of small trades for financial stocks, where it was found that measured price shifts were greater than expected for the smaller volumes traded.

The deviation has significant implications for risk-management: a decrease in direct transaction costs resulted in an unexpected increase in indirect costs through price impact.

Assuming that price impact models are incorporated into optimal trading strategies for dynamic hedging, this would have translated to an increase in unexpected hedging costs for derivative instruments on financial stocks.

The investigation contributes to the general analysis of electronic markets as an observational science, since measures of effects of change in regulation may only be inferred from past behaviour and not from repeated experiment.

Further investigation should include closer analysis of the order books of financial sector stocks, using more in depth market-quality measures, in order to uncover a comprehensive explanation for the observed anomaly.

Price impact results

include details of the computed price impacts for trade records of varying size for transactions of constituents in the JSE-FINI, JSE-RESI and JSE-INDI. Each subfigure uses a scatter plot to depict the impacts of the individual transactions. Two impact curves are also shown, both obtained from averaging the impacts and normalised volumes in each of the 20 logarithmically spaced bins. The first impact curve is obtained when all transaction data are considered where as the second impact curve only considers transactions with normalised transaction sizes no smaller than 10- 3.2 and no larger than 10.

Power-law calibrations

include details of computed α exponents and p-values of the power-law relationship between transaction size and impact for a subset of transactions of constituents in the JSE-FINI, JSE-RESI and JSE-INDI. These power-law results pertain specifically to trade records with normalised transaction sizes no smaller than 10- 3.2 and no larger than 10.
