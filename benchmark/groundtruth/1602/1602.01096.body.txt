UV to IR Luminosities and Dust Attenuation Determined from ~  4000 K-Selected Galaxies at [formula] in the ZFOURGE Survey

Introduction

Constraining the dust content of galaxies is vital to improving our knowledge of star formation histories and galaxy evolution. The geometry and orientation of dust grains, as well as their spatial distribution in galaxies greatly affect the shape of a galaxy's observed spectral energy distribution (SED) [\citep=Chevallard2013] [\citep=Casey2014] [\citep=Penner2015] [\citep=Salmon2015]. Correcting for these effects is necessary to understand the intrinsic properties of a galaxy. For nearby galaxies, spectroscopy provides insight into these effects. However, because spectroscopy requires significantly more telescope time and brighter targets than photometry, photometry is a better choice for large, deep samples.

Beyond the local universe, galactic properties are often determined by fitting stellar population synthesis models to a handful of photometric points, then assigning redshifts, ages, metallicities, masses, etc. to the galaxy based on the best fitting SED [\citep=Papovich2001] [\citep=Franx2003]. The use of medium band near-IR filters in the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey [\citep=Whitaker2011] and the Fourstar Evolution Survey [\citep=Straatman2016] has enabled more accurate photometric redshift (zphot) measurements of large numbers of galaxies, on the order of [formula] (for Ks < 25) when compared to higher quality redshifts from grism [\citep=Bezanson2015] and spectroscopic observations [\citep=Nanayakkara2016]. These surveys also cover legacy fields which have extensive photometric observations from the rest-frame UV to the near-IR.

The combination of greater photometric sampling and near-IR filters which identify the 4000 [formula] break allow for a more constrained SED fit [\citep=Kriek2013a]. This makes these surveys prime datasets for the development of multi-wavelength composite SEDs. If one can determine which galaxies have intrinsically similar SEDs, then by de-redshifting and scaling photometry for galaxies at several redshifts one can generate a well-sampled composite SED. Over the last few years, several papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-wavelength composite SEDs in determining galaxy properties [\citep=Kriek2011] [\citep=Kriek2013a] [\citep=Utomo2014] [\citep=Yano2016]. In this work we use data from the ZFOURGE survey (http://zfourge.tamu.edu/) to define composite SEDs due not only to the survey's accurate redshifts, but also its depth (limiting magnitude of K  ~   ~ 25.5 mag). This allows us to build composite SEDs from galaxies at higher redshifts and lower masses than previous studies while still maintaining precision in our zphot measurements.

The optical to near-infrared (IR) SED characterizes the properties of the stellar populations. To better track total star formation, rest-frame mid-far IR observations, which indicate the amount of dust heated by young, massive stars, are essential [\citep=Kennicutt1998] [\citep=Kennicutt2012]. The ultraviolet (UV) flux more directly traces these stars, and the ratio of these two components, the infrared excess (IRX), is a tracer of dust attenuation in the UV. The UV slope (β) is also sensitive to the effects of dust [\citep=Calzetti1994], and it can be compared to the IRX to determine how dust attenuation affects the light of star-forming galaxies.

This IRX-  β relation has been fit for various samples in the local universe [\citep=Meurer1999a] [\citep=Howell2010] [\citep=Overzier2011] and in some cases compared to samples at higher redshifts [\citep=Reddy2010] [\citep=Reddy2011] [\citep=Penner2012] [\citep=Casey2014] [\citep=Salmon2015]. Notably, [\cite=Howell2010] found that (U)LIRGs in the local universe do show significant scatter about IRX-  β relations, largely due to variations in IR flux. The resulting relations have also been used to derive properties such as continuum reddening [\citep=Puglisi2015] and distributions of dust in dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) [\citep=Penner2012]. Several of these works found discrepancies between high-z dusty star-forming galaxies and local IRX-  β relations. Many of these studies estimate IR fluxes from a single photometric point, usually a Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm flux. Our inclusion of Herschel data broadens the IR wavelength range and improves determination of the IR flux, although uncertainties still do exist.

We assume a ΛCDM cosmology of ΩM  =  0.3, ΩΛ  =  0.7, and H0  =  70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1 and a Chabrier IMF [\citep=Chabrier2003], and adopt an AB magnitude system [\citep=Oke1983].

Data & Methods

Data

We use photometric data from the deep near-IR ZFOURGE survey [\citep=Straatman2016], covering the CDFS [\citep=Giacconi2002], COSMOS [\citep=Scoville2007], and UDS [\citep=Lawrence2007] fields, as well as archival data to obtain photometric coverage over observed wavelengths ranging from 0.3 μm to 8 μm. The near-IR filters of ZFOURGE split the traditional J and H bands into 3 and 2 medium-band filters, respectively. These allow us to constrain the photometric redshifts of the observed galaxies with a much higher precision than previously available - σNMAD  =  0.02 [\citep=Nanayakkara2016].

We also include data from Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm (GOODS-S: PI Dickinson, COSMOS: PI Scoville, UDS: PI Dunlop) and Herschel/PACS 100 μm and 160 μm filters from deep Herschel surveys of GOODS-S (Elbaz et al. 2011) and of the CANDELS COSMOS and UDS fields (PI: Dickinson; Inami et al. in preparation). Section 2.3 from [\cite=Tomczak2015] provides a description of how IR fluxes were measured. Critically, these data allow better characterization of the rest-frame infrared wavelengths - and therefore dust content - of many of these galaxies.

To reduce any uncertainties due to photometric errors, we use a Ks-band signal to noise cut of 20. We also restrict our sample to the redshift range 1.0 < z < 3.0.

Building Composite SEDs

We outline our method, which broadly follows the methods of [\cite=Kriek2011] and [\cite=Utomo2014], in this section. More details will be included in an upcoming paper (Forrest et al., in prep).

After making the cuts mentioned above, we are left with 3984 galaxies. Photometry in 22 artificial rest-frame filters is calculated for each galaxy as synthetic photometry based on an SED fit using EAZY [\citep=Brammer2008]. The similarity of galaxies is calculated using the shape of the synthetic photometry as in [\cite=Kriek2011]:

[formula]

where b12 is the (dis)similarity between SED shape as probed by the synthetic photometry, and a12 is a scaling factor.

The galaxy with the most similar galaxies (b < 0.05) is termed the primary, and those similar to it are termed analogs. Once groupings are finalized, the observed photometry of all galaxies in a group is de-redshifted and scaled to unity in the optical. Medians of these points are taken in bins of wavelength to construct a composite galaxy SED. We obtain 38 composite SEDs from 2598 galaxies that we use for the remainder of this analysis; these have a resolving power of R  ~  45 in the rest-frame optical. The remaining galaxies are in groups with fewer than 20 analogs; these galaxies will be explored in future work (Forrest et al., in prep). Example composite SEDs are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:_Composites].

Each composite point is dependent on the filter curves of the underlying photometry. To determine rest-frame colors and parameters from SED-fitting, custom filter curves are defined for each point in our composite SEDs. This is done by de-redshifting observed filter curves and scaling them to equal volume, then summing their responses. Note that the errorbars on the composite SED points are σNMAD errors on the medians and do not represent the errors in the photometry of the analogs. In addition, a number of galaxies have negative flux measurements in the IR because their photometry is dominated by noise in the background-subtracted images; these are plotted as downward arrows in Figure [\ref=fig:_Composites]. Such non-detections are included when calculating medians and errors to build our composites and are not removed. These composite SEDs reveal details, such as Hα emission, that are usually only available through spectroscopy.

For each of our composite SEDs, we also generate 100 bootstrapped composite SEDs. Each one is made by performing a bootstrap resampling of the analog galaxies for the composite SED and recalculating the SED points and custom filter curves. For parameters such as UV slope, UV flux, and IR flux, the same methods are applied to these bootstrapped composite SEDs to obtain errors on said parameters.

Analysis

UVJ Colors of Composite SEDs

In the star-forming section of the UVJ plane, a strong correlation exists between redder colors and increased dust attenuation [\citep=Wuyts2007] [\citep=Williams2009] [\citep=Patel2012]. Additionally, the quiescent population has a considerably lower specific star formation rate (sSFR) [\citep=Williams2009] [\citep=Papovich2015] [\citep=Straatman2016]. It should be noted that the sSFR values reported by our SED-fitting program, FAST [\citep=Kriek2009] do not consider the IR portion of the data. In Figure [\ref=fig:_UVJ] we plot our composite SEDs on the UVJ diagram to analyze these relations. The composite SEDs span the range covered by observed galaxies quite well, although the most extreme colors are not represented due to their rarity in our initial sample. The previously known strong trend of star-forming galaxies with increasing dust (AV) from the bottom-left to the top-right of the plot is quite clear, as is the strong decrease in sSFR from the star-forming to the quiescent regions. We analyze these results in conjunction with our IRX-  β results in Section [\ref=Res3].

IRX-  β Relation of Star-Forming Composite SEDs

To obtain β we fit the scaled rest-frame UV data from our composite SEDs with a power law of the form [formula]. In this work we use photometry with rest-frame wavelengths in the range 1500  <  λ  /    <  2600 to fit the UV slope, similar to the range of the [\cite=Calzetti1994] fitting windows, and mask points within 175 [formula] of the 2175 [formula] feature [\citep=Noll2009] [\citep=Buat2011] [\citep=Buat2012]. We also obtain the UV flux for our IRX calculation by integrating under the power law fit determined above in a 350 [formula] window centered on 1600 [formula] as in [\cite=Meurer1999a].

We calculate the IR flux by fitting the average template from [\cite=Chary2001] to the scaled, de-redshifted composite SED IR points, and integrating under the resultant template from 8-  1000 μm (Forrest et al., in prep). Additionally we only use such points that are at longer wavelengths than 8 μm in the rest-frame. Individual galaxies in our composite subsamples have luminosities [formula], while the average of galaxies in a single composite range [formula]. Galaxies in a particular composite have a median LIR scatter of 0.4 dex. For star-forming composite SEDs, this model is sufficient for our analysis. It should be noted however that the [\cite=Chary2001] templates are not designed to fit quiescent galaxies. As such, quiescent composite SEDs (as determined by position on the UVJ diagram) are neither included on our IRX-  β plot, nor considered when calculating our IRX-  β relation.

Having obtained the three measurements necessary for the IRX-  β plot, we show our star-forming composite SEDs in Figure [\ref=fig:_L_IRXB]. We find the IRX-  β relation that fits these composite SEDs using the form

[formula]

Here BCUV corrects to obtain all luminosity redward of the Lyman break (912 [formula]). We assume BCUV  =  1.68, as derived in similar studies [\citep=Meurer1999a] [\citep=Overzier2011] [\citep=Takeuchi2012] [\citep=Casey2014] to compute the least squares best fit to the data.

The other parameter is the dust attenuation at 1600 [formula], which is assumed to be a foreground screen, and thus linearly correlated with β as A1600  =  q + rβ [\citep=Meurer1999a]. Performing a fit to the star-forming composite SEDs we obtain:

[formula]

Our slope parameter of r = 2.39 is steeper than previously determined values of r  ~  2 (see Table 1). There is no discrepancy in our blue star-forming composite SEDs, as they are consistent with both local relations [\citep=Meurer1999a] [\citep=Overzier2011] [\citep=Takeuchi2012] and higher redshift samples [\citep=Reddy2010] [\citep=Reddy2011]. This can be seen in the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:_L_A1600].

Several previous studies of IR-luminous galaxies at [formula] have shown that IR-luminous galaxies have greater scatter in the IRX-  β plane and lie above relations derived for starburst galaxies [\citep=Howell2010] [\citep=Overzier2011] [\citep=Reddy2011] [\citep=Casey2014]. Similarly, the composite SEDs most discrepant from the [\cite=Meurer1999a] relation are those with the highest average IR flux among their analogs, in agreement with [\cite=Howell2010] ([formula] and [\cite=Penner2012] ([formula]). However, many of these studies used UV- or IR-selected samples, whereas our work uses the largest sample yet of mass-selected galaxies at [formula].

More recently, [\cite=Talia2015] analyzed the A1600  -  β relation using high-redshift UV spectra of 62 IR-detected galaxies at 1 < z < 3, obtaining a much flatter fit than previous work, although still broadly consistent with predictions based on the Calzetti attenuation law. Our work, utilizing photometry only, includes a much larger sample, suggesting that previous works making use of local IRX-  β relations incorrectly estimate the extinction of the UV continuum for high redshift dust-obscured samples.

This offset implies that the dust attenuation at redshifts [formula] is different from that in local galaxies; specifically, the steeper slope of our A1600  -  β relation means that dusty star-forming galaxies in our sample's redshift range have more UV attenuation due to dust than would be assumed from local calibrations. This amounts to a 0.5 magnitude underestimate of 1600 [formula] attenuation for galaxies with β = 0, increasing towards [formula], and becoming consistent with the M99 relation for β  ~   - 1.

Dust Attenuation from Composite SED Colors

Both the IRX and UVJ colors separate the red and blue star-forming populations effectively; therefore we can also analyze the relation between IRX and these colors. We fit our A1600 values derived from the IRX-  β fits to the rest-frame colors (Figure [\ref=fig:_L_A1600]). The resulting linear relations are

[formula]

which can be used in conjunction with the IRX- A1600 relation to obtain

[formula]

Our derived A1600 for star-forming galaxies correlates well with the (U - V)REST color, as can be seen in the upper central panel of Figure [\ref=fig:_L_A1600], allowing it to be used as a proxy for UV dust attenuation at these redshifts for all but the reddest star-forming galaxies. Because rest-frame colors are fairly easily determined, these relations provide a useful way to estimate dust corrections for star-forming galaxies without requiring a spectrum.

We use the above relations to derive the direction of the unit vector of IRX and A1600 on the UVJ diagram. While the IRX trend more or less parallels the distribution of the star-forming composite SEDs, it is apparent that the A1600 vector on the UVJ diagram does not parallel the color evolution of star-forming galaxies as AV does [\citep=Wuyts2007] [\citep=Williams2009].

Conclusions

In this work we empirically generate a set of 38 composite SEDs from the photometric data points of ~  4000 Ks-band selected galaxies in the redshift range 1 < z < 3 from the mass complete ZFOURGE survey. The use of composite SEDs allows us to densely probe the SEDs of large samples of galaxies without spectroscopy. We analyze these galaxies using the UVJ diagnostic plot, and verify that this simple color-  color relation test does an excellent job of separating quiescent galaxies from star-forming galaxies.

In addition, we explore the IRX-  β relation, which parameterizes the dust content of galaxies, for our star-forming composite SEDs. While there is a range of results regarding IRX-  β in previous studies, this work utilizes a large, mass-selected sample to derive the relation at intermediate redshifts. We find that these composite SEDs lie above the relations derived for local samples of galaxies, indicating differences in dust properties. Specifically, dusty star-forming galaxies have more dust attenuation in the UV, and are therefore intrinsically bluer, than would be derived based on calibrations from samples of non-dust obscured galaxies extending the results of previous work in the local universe to [formula].

We also find trends with low scatter between dust attenuation and rest-frame UVJ colors for star-forming galaxies, which can be used to parameterize dust of star-forming galaxies without spectra. Future work will explore other properties of our composite SEDs, such as Hα equivalent widths and morphological characteristics.
