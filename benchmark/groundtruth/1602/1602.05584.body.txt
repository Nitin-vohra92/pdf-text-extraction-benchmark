Identifying planetary biosignature impostors: Spectral features of CO and O4 resulting from abiotic O2/O3 production

Introduction

In recent years dozens of exoplanets have been identified that are likely or confirmed to be rocky in composition, analogous to the solar system's inner terrestrial planets (e.g., [\citealt=Berta-Thompson+15]). Some of these known planets reside within the �habitable zone� (HZ) of their host star [\citep=Kopparapu+13], but are too distant from Earth for spectroscopic follow-up to characterize their planetary environments. The upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Telescope (TESS; [\citealt=Ricker+14] [\citealt=Sullivan+15]) and ground-based surveys (e.g., [\citealt=Charbonneau+09]) will identify more nearby terrestrial HZ planets that are amenable to further study by missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST; [\citealt=Deming+09]) or large ground-based telescopes (e.g., [\citealt=Snellen+13]). Many of these terrestrial exoplanets will have secondary atmospheres in which photochemistry, climate, history of atmospheric escape, volcanic outgassing, and perhaps biology will play significant roles in their atmospheric compositions (e.g., Segura et al. 2005, 2010). Understanding these star-planet interactions and geological processes will be important for characterizing a terrestrial planet's atmosphere, both to understand the planetary environment, and to increase the confidence with which we can identify planetary phenomena as being more likely to be produced by life (e.g., [\citealt=DesMarais+02] [\citealt=Segura+05] [\citealt=Seager+12]) than by abiotic processes.

Atmospheric O2 (or its photochemical byproduct O3) is often considered a robust astronomical biosignature, because through the history of our planet life has been the dominant source of this gas. The exact mechanism(s) and timeline for the oxygenation of Earth�s atmosphere is still under debate, but there is broad agreement on the fundamental causes [\citep=Lyons+14]. The O2 in Earth's atmosphere is unstable over geological timescales and would be depleted by reactions with reduced volcanic gases and through oxidation of the surface [\citep=Catling13], thus requiring an active source to maintain appreciable levels. On Earth, that active source exists in the form of photosynthetic production of O2 by life, followed by burial of organic carbon [\citep=Catling13], which separates the organic carbon material from atmospheric O2. The photochemical production of very small amounts of O2 occurs on Earth from the photolysis of O-bearing molecules, but would not build up to appreciable levels in the absence of biology due to the shape of the UV spectrum of the Sun and significant sinks for O2 [\citep=Domagal-Goldman+14] [\citep=Harman+15]. The O3 in Earth's atmosphere is a result of photochemical reactions involving O2, and the presence of large quantities of O3 has been suggested as being an indicator of abundant, photosynthetically-generated O2 [\citep=DesMarais+02] [\citep=Segura+05]. Recently, it has been calculated that the strongest disequilibrium indicator in Earth's atmosphere-ocean system in terms of free energy is the N2-O2-dominated atmosphere coexisting with a liquid H2O surface ocean [\citep=Krissansen-Totton+15]. The common thread to all of these signatures is the presence of photosynthetically-produced O2, and there have been many studies into the feasibility of future ground-based and space-based observations to detect O2 spectral features in exoplanet atmospheres (e.g., [\citealt=Snellen+13] [\citealt=Misra+14a] [\citealt=Dalcanton+15]).

Even though abiotic sources for abundant O2/O3 are not present for Earth, three major categories of abiotic O2 mechanisms have been recently identified that may affect planets with different atmospheric histories or within the HZs of different types of host star. These include: 1) the photochemical production of stable concentrations of O2/O3 from CO2 photolysis, which depends on the UV spectral slope of the host star and abundance of H-bearing molecules in the atmosphere [\citep=Domagal-Goldman+14] [\citep=Gao+15] [\citep=Harman+15] [\citep=Selsis+02] [\citep=Tian+14], 2) massive XUV-driven H-escape and O2-build up on planets in the HZ during the pre-main sequence, especially for planets orbiting the latest type stars [\citep=Luger+15], and 3) abiotic O2 buildup due to H-escape from N2-poor atmospheres that lack tropospheric H2O cold traps [\citep=Wordsworth+14]. In this work we refer to O2 and O3 produced by these abiotic processes as �biosignature impostors�. Understanding potential false positives for O2/O3 biosignatures is critical and timely for informing the search for life beyond the solar system, given that the first potentially habitable planets to be characterized with transmission observations will likely orbit M dwarfs, and so will be most susceptible to O2 biosignature impostors through CO2 photolysis and XUV-driven hydrogen escape (mechanisms (1) and (2) above).

Possible discriminants for false positive mechanisms have previously been discussed in the literature. For instance, identifying the byproducts of CO2 photolysis using direct imaging was discussed in recent papers that described this false positive mechanism [\citep=Domagal-Goldman+14] [\citep=Harman+15]. N2-depleted atmospheres without a cold trap (mechanism (3)) may be identified via the absence of pressure-sensitive N2-N2 CIA features [\citep=Schwieterman+15]. However, previous studies have not addressed identification of CO2 photolysis with transmission spectroscopy, or identification of the O2-dominated atmospheres that result from massive H-escape. The O2 abundance on Earth has self-limited to [formula] 0.3 bar due to the chemical instability of higher O2 abundances with organic matter [\citep=Kump08]. Thus, the potentially very high O2 pressures from massive H-loss would constitute a separate and discernible regime from biologically produced O2 atmospheres.

Here we examine the detectability, in simulated JWST transmission spectra, of CO from CO2 photolysis as an indicator for abiotically generated O2/O3 for a terrestrial HZ planet orbiting an M dwarf. We also examine the detectability of highly pressure-dependent O2-O2 (O4) collisionally induced absorption (CIA) features in transmission and reflectance spectroscopy. These features would be indicators of massive, post-runaway, abiotic O2 atmospheres. This examination builds on earlier work by [\citep=Misra+14a] that analyzed the capacity of O4 bands to determine pressure in O2-rich atmospheres, which were presumed to be photosynthetically generated. In § 2 we describe the models used and the inputs to those models. In § 3 we present the spectra of the biosignature impostor scenarios and the detectability of our proposed spectral discriminators. We discuss some of the implications of these results in § 4 and present our conclusions in § 5.

Methods and Models

Atmosphere Profiles

High-CO photochemical false positive

The first atmosphere scenario we consider is a habitable, but lifeless, planet with an N2-CO2-H2O atmosphere, orbiting in the habitable zone of a late (M or K) type dwarf and susceptible to the abiotic accumulation of O2 and CO through CO2 photolysis:

[formula]

Photochemically liberated O will lead to the formation of both O2 and O3 through the Chapman scheme, reviewed in [\citet=Domagal-Goldman+14]. For this scenario we use the �high-O2� case for GJ 876 from [\citet=Harman+15] as our atmospheric chemical and temperature profiles (Figure [\ref=fig1]a), as that case led to potentially detectable levels of O2. GJ 876 is a planet-hosting M4V star with R*=0.38 R[formula] located 4.66 pc from the solar system [\citep=vonBraun+14]. The modeled planet orbits at a semi-major axis of 0.15 AU. Its N2-dominated atmosphere contains 5% CO2, 6% O2 and 2% CO. The temperature profile was calculated in [\citet=Harman+15] by assuming a surface temperature commensurate with the stellar insolation and a moist adiabatic lapse rate to an isothermal stratosphere of 175 K. The isothermal stratosphere produces a conservative estimate of the scale height (and therefore transit depths) by neglecting shortwave heating of O3. Isothermal stratospheres are commonly chosen in studies of abiotic O2 generation (e.g., [\citealt=Domagal-Goldman+14] [\citealt=Tian+14]) and we adopt this assumption here to be consistent with previous literature.

O2-dominated post-runaway atmospheres

[\citet=Luger+15] calculate that up to thousands of bars of abiotic O2 can be generated by XUV-driven H-escape during the pre-main sequence phase of the planet's host star. This depends on a number of factors, including the starting H2O inventory (losing the H from one Earth ocean leaves behind up to 240 bars of O2). Some of this O2 would oxidize the surface; however we assume that there is a point where the oxidization of the planetary surface is complete and O2 remains stable in the atmosphere. Even if geological processes slowly draw down this remaining O2, much could remain for extended time periods, limited by the rate of mantle overturn. Since many parameters determine how much (if any) abiotic O2 would remain behind on these planets when they are observed, we therefore prescribe a range of surface pressures with a 95% O2 mixing ratio: P0= 1, 10, and 100 bar. The CO2 content is similar to Earth's, f[formula]=3.6e-4, and the rest of the atmosphere consists of N2 and trace photochemically produced species such as CO and O3. To self-consistently calculate temperature and ozone profiles, we used a version of the coupled photochemical-climate model Atmos[\citep=Arney+16], based on photochemical and climate models originating with the Kasting group [\citep=Kasting+80] [\citep=Segura+05] [\citep=Haqq-Misra+08] [\citep=Domagal-Goldman+14] and upgraded to handle high-pressure O2-dominated atmospheres. We assume a completely desiccated planet (no H2O) orbiting at the inner edge of the HZ (a = 0.12 AU) of a star with identical properties to GJ 876. See Figure [\ref=fig1]b for the atmospheric chemical profiles of the P0=100 bar scenario.

Radiative Transfer Models and Inputs

The core radiative transfer code used for this work is the Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SMART) model developed by D. Crisp [\citep=Crisp97] [\citep=Meadows+96], which is a line-by-line, multi-stream, multi-scattering model. SMART is well-validated from data-model comparisons of Earth, Venus, and Mars (e.g., [\citealt=Robinson+11] [\citealt=Robinson+14] [\citealt=Arney+14]). SMART can be used to calculate synthetic direct-imaging spectra and transmission spectra using a transmission capable version of SMART that includes refraction [\citep=Misra+14a] [\citep=Misra+14b]. All modeled spectra include O4 absorption (O2-O2 CIA), although it only produces a strong spectral impact in the cases with O2-dominated atmospheres. Weak O4 bands are present in Earth's disk-averaged spectrum [\citep=Tinetti+06] [\citep=Turnbull+06]. O4 absorption has been found to be only very weakly temperature-dependent, suggesting that O2-O2 CIA dominates over true van der Waals molecule absorption [\citep=Thalman+13]. The CIA absorption from O4 varies quadratically with density, and the absorption coefficients can be given as:

[formula]

where α is the absorption coefficient, d[formula] is the density of O2 molecules, and B[formula] is a density-normalized CIA coefficient. We use the density-normalized O4 coefficients from C. Hermans for the 0.333-0.666 μm spectral range [\citep=Hermans+99], and the values from [\citet=Greenblatt+90] and [\citet=Mate+99] for the 1.06 and 1.27 μm features.

JWST NIRISS & NIRSpec noise model

We calculated the synthetic JWST observations as described by [\citet=Deming+09] with some updates. The total throughput of the NIRISS [\citep=Doyon+14] and NIRSpec [\citep=Ferruit+14] instruments, including the telescope, were taken from Albert (2015, private communication) and from http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst/nirspec-pce, respectively. Thermal and zodiacal background were included as described by [\citet=Deming+09], but the background only becomes significant longward of approximately 4 μm. There is very little overhead for NIRISS transit spectroscopy (Albert 2015, private communication), so we adopted an observing efficiency of unity for NIRISS. For NIRSpec, we calculated the observing efficiency assuming a 2048 ×   32 subarray [\citep=Tumlinson+10], and adopted a number of groups in an integration (ngrp) of 4 from [\citet=Karakla+10]. For both instruments, the observations are close to saturation, but we assume that saturation can be avoided by slightly dithering or scanning the telescope perpendicular to dispersion. We adopt photon-limited noise, dropping the hypothetical instrument systematic noise used by [\citet=Deming+09]. Recent HST experience has demonstrated close to photon-limited performance for bright stars [\citep=Kreidberg+14]. We represent the star using a Phoenix model atmosphere [\citep=Allard+95].

Simulated Spectra of Atmospheres with Abiotic O2

We present photochemically self-consistent test cases for two different false positive mechanisms: 1) an Earth-size planet with a prebiotic atmosphere (Figure [\ref=fig1]a) orbiting in the HZ of GJ 876, and 2) an Earth-size planet with an O2-dominated (95%) 100-bar atmosphere orbiting at the inner edge of the HZ of GJ 876 (Figure [\ref=fig1]b). These atmospheres are free of clouds and aerosols. We examine scenario (2) in transmitted and reflected light. In the reflected light case we treat GJ 876 as a stand-in for the handful of nearby late-type stars whose habitable zones may be examined with future direct-imaging telescopes such as HDST/LUVOIR [\citep=Stark+14] [\citep=Dalcanton+15].

Figure [\ref=fig2] shows the calculated spectral transmission depths and simulated observations of case (1) in the JWST NIRISS (0.6-2.5 μm) and NIRSpec (2.9-5.0 μm) bands (left panel). Our calculations show that the 1.65, 2.0, and 4.3 μm CO2 bands can be detected with a SNR >   3 (3.1, 4.3 and 8.0, respectively) when binned across the absorption bands and compared to the continuum level. The 2.35 μm CO band has a SNR of 3.7 while the 4.6 μm CO band has an SNR of 2.6. Other absorption bands have SNRs [formula] 1. The simultaneous detection of both CO2 and CO could indicate CO2 photolysis in the planet's atmosphere. Note that for the integration time used here, the relatively narrow O2-A band (0.76 μm) and weaker O2 features would not be detectable. On the right side panel of Figure [\ref=fig2] we show a spectrum of modern Earth orbiting GJ 876 using atmosphere profiles from Figure 1 of [\citet=Schwieterman+15], but with otherwise the same parameters as the left panel. This spectrum is not self-consistent with the star, but provided for comparison.

Figure [\ref=fig3] shows the calculated transmission spectrum depths of the high-O2 atmosphere from case (2). The SNRs of the 1.06 and 1.27 μm O4 bands are 2.8 and 3.1, respectively. The detection of strong O4 bands would indicate a very massive O2 atmosphere free of aerosols at high altitudes.

In Figure [\ref=fig4], we show simulated reflectance (direct-imaging) spectra of O2-dominated atmospheres (P0=1, 10, and 100 bar) seen at quadrature (solar zenith angle of 60[formula]) using SMART. We use the chemical profiles described in § 2.1.2. For comparison we include the spectrum of an Earth atmosphere [\citep=Schwieterman+15]. A gray surface albedo of AB = 0.15 is assumed. The O4 bands at 0.345, 0.36, 0.38, 0.445, 0.475, 0.53, 0.57, 0.63, 1.06, and 1.27 μm are labeled, with the NIR bands saturating at the highest O2 abundance. This simple test case demonstrates that if the high-O2 atmospheres proposed by [\citet=Luger+15] exist, the O4 absorption band strength in those planetary spectra would rival or exceed that of the monomer O2 bands. These spectra are qualitatively different than modern-Earth's spectrum, even in the 0.3-1.0 μm range, with a different shape, broader O2 features, and additional features from O4. These are all signs of a much higher O2 abundance than the Earth's atmosphere - self-regulated by negative feedbacks - has ever achieved.

O4 and CO as Spectral Indicators of Abiotic Oxygen

The first potentially habitable terrestrial planet atmospheres to be characterized via transmission spectroscopy by JWST or large ground-based observatories will likely be orbiting near the inner edge of the HZ of late type stars [\citep=Deming+09] [\citep=Sullivan+15]. This is due to the detection biases of planet transit searches and the shorter orbital periods of HZ planets around late type stars, allowing greater potential to integrate over multiple transits for characterization. Unfortunately, according to current modeling studies [\citep=Harman+15] [\citep=Luger+15] these planets are the worlds in which �biosignature impostors�- abiotic O2 and O3 - are most likely. Furthermore, this potential for false positives for life is even greater for the extended inner habitable zone for �dry� planets [\citep=Abe+11], which may have an even greater probability of being characterized first. The development of observing strategies to mitigate the potential for a �false positive� biosignature detection is thus relevant now. We argue that the detection of significant CO and CO2 could indicate robust CO2 photolysis, which can produce abiotic O2/O3, and also that strong O4 bands would be indicative of an oxygen atmosphere too massive to be biological. Thus CO2/CO and O4 are potentially powerful spectral discriminators against abiotic O2/O3 in future potentially habitable exoplanet observations.

Furthermore, in the cases presented here, the spectral discriminators against abiotic O2/O3 are more detectable with a hypothetical JWST observation than the O2 or O3 signatures themselves. In our example spectra, neither O2 nor O3 would be directly detectable with just 10 transits, but the abiotic discriminators CO/CO2 and O4 could be. This provides an opportunity to maximize the utility of observing time if the ultimate goal is to characterize planets where true biosignatures are obtainable. If spectral indicators for biosignature impostors are detected with reasonable confidence, the community may wish to reallocate the remaining time to other promising targets, rather than integrate further. Additionally, it may also be the case that O2 or O3 may be identified in the same targets via other observing strategies at a concurrent or future date. For example, it has been proposed that O2 may be found via ground-based Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) observations of the 0.76 μm O2-A [\citep=Snellen+13]. Observations by space-based telescopes such as JWST or a future LUVOIR telescope operating in transit mode on a favorable target could detect or rule out these indicators before significant observing time is expended by ELTs on promising targets. If an ELT observation of a potentially habitable planet is conducted, these potential spectral discriminators could be characterized in addition to the target band (e.g., the O2-A band).

It is important to note that the strength of an absorption band in transmission, unlike in reflected light, is not dependent on the mixing ratio of the gas at the surface or the absolute column abundance of the gas. Rather, the strength is mostly dependent on the altitude at which the gas produces an optical depth near unity, and thus the distribution of the gas in the atmosphere is extremely important. Direct imaging of CO2 and CO spectral signatures on an Earth twin is potentially problematic because they are weak and narrow shortward of 2.0 μm and the planetary flux at the strongest bands (e.g., the 4.3 μm CO2 band) is low [\citep=Robinson+14] [\citep=Schwieterman+15]. Our work shows these bands are much stronger in transmission. Thus transmission spectroscopy is complementary to potential future direct-imaging characterization missions, and in particular for characterizing potential biosignature impostors. Transmission spectroscopy is also more sensitive to Earth-like CH4 abundances than direct-imaging. Detection of CH4 with O2/O3 would help confirm a true biosignature, as modeling predicts extremely low CH4 abundances in cases of abiotic O2/O3 generation [\citep=Domagal-Goldman+14].

Next-generation space-based direct-imaging telescope concepts such as ATLAST/LUVOIR, HDST, and HabEx would be able to directly image planets in the HZ [\citep=Rauscher+15] [\citep=Dalcanton+15] [\citep=Swain+15], and thus potentially characterize biosignature gases in exoplanet atmospheres. Detection of strong O4 bands in UV/VIS/NIR reflected light would indicate a large O2 atmosphere originating from massive H-escape. While planets in the �conservative� HZ of G and F type stars would be high priority for these missions and are less susceptible to an extended history of runaway H-loss and O2-buildup, planets orbiting between the �optimistic� (recent Venus) and �conservative� (runaway greenhouse) inner edge of the HZ, potentially brighter targets for imaging, would also be susceptible to this process [\citep=Luger+15]. Additionally, many nearby K and M type stars would also likely be characterized [\citep=Stark+14] [\citep=Dalcanton+15], where larger regions of the HZ would be susceptible to generating biosignature impostors.

Conclusions

Recently proposed mechanisms for developing abiotic O2/O3 in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres would produce spectral discriminators that are potentially identifiable with future telescope observations, including JWST. These discriminants are more detectable than O2 or O3 in transmission observations. CO seen at 2.35 μm or 4.6 μm with CO2 at 2 or 4.3 μm would indicate robust CO2 photolysis and suggest a high likelihood of abiotic O2/O3 generation. We find that CO in a realistic exoplanet atmosphere orbiting a late type star could be seen with a SNR >   3 at 2.35 μm in JWST-NIRISS with as few as 10 transits. O4 bands seen in transmission or direct-imaging can be diagnostic of high-O2 post-runaway atmospheres that have experienced a history of H-escape. The 1.06 and 1.27 μm O4 bands in a massive, O2-dominated atmosphere without high-altitude aerosols would be potentially detectable with a SNR [formula] 3 with as few as 10 transits with JWST-NIRISS, assuming photon-limited noise.
