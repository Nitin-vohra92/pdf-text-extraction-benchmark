A field of quantum upper triangular matrices

and Matthias Floré

Introduction

Quantum groups, and in particular quantized enveloping algebras and their dual quantum function algebras, have manifestations in different contexts, for example purely algebraic, at either a formal or a scalar parameter, or operator algebraic, at either the C*-algebraic or von Neumann algebraic level. The correspondence between the scalar, algebraic approach and the operator algebraic approach is at this moment well understood in the compact semisimple case, see e.g.  the basic reference works [\cite=ChP94] [\cite=KS97] [\cite=Maj95]. Also the correspondence between the algebraic formal approach and the operator algebraic approach works nicely in the compact semisimple setting, using the formalism of continuous fields of C*-algebras [\cite=NT11].

However, it is known since Drinfel'd's fundamental work [\cite=Dri88] that formal quantized enveloping algebras can also be seen as formal quantized function algebras, reflecting the Poisson duality which is present in the quasi-classical limit. The operator algebraic version of this 'dual field' seems not to have received much attention yet in the compact semisimple case, although it offers an interesting case of a family of discrete 'quantum' structures converging to a non-discrete, continuous classical structure.

In this article, we want to start amending this situation. Our main aim will be to show how the family of duals of the quantum groups SUq(2) [\cite=Wor87a] can be embedded into a continuous field of quantum groups over the interval (0,1] such that, for q = 1, the fiber is isomorphic to the group of special upper triangular 2-by-2 matrices with positive diagonal.

Our point of departure will be the work of Blanchard [\cite=Bla96], where a detailed study of fields of quantum groups and fields of multiplicative unitaries was made. Combined with the work of Woronowicz [\cite=Wor95] and results from [\cite=KL11], this will allow us to obtain our main theorems in quite a computation-free way. We note that in [\cite=Bla96], it was shown how the C(SUq(2)) can be made into a field of C*-algebras which (as quantum groups) converge to the group C*-algebra of the az + b-group for q  →  1. The abstract duality theory of [\cite=Bla96] can then also be used to yield a field of 'quantum upper triangular matrices', but we prefer to present a more direct and explicit approach, which also seems more amenable to generalizations to higher rank situations. We refrain from making a direct comparison with the field obtained in [\cite=Bla96].

The precise content of our article is as follows.

In the first section, we construct the underlying field of C*-algebras C0(G) over (0,1], making use of the notion of crossed product with a partial automorphism [\cite=Exe94]. Continuity of our field will follow from a general result concerning continuous fields of such crossed products. We also give a concrete field of representations for our field of C*-algebras.

In the second section, we use the Baaj-Woronowicz theory of affiliated ope-rators to show that C0(G) possesses a coassociative comultiplication Δ from C0(G) into [formula], which is moreover bisimplifiable in the sense of [\cite=Bla96]. This easily lets us conclude that (C0(G),Δ) has an associated conti-nuous field of multiplicative unitaries.

We assume in this article that all Hilbert spaces are separable. We also assume that all C*-algebras (denoted by the letters [formula]) are separable, except for those which obviously can't be, such as multiplier C*-algebras of non-unital C*-algebras. In particular, all locally compact Hausdorff spaces are assumed second countable.

We will call representation of a C*-algebra A a non-degenerate *-representation of A on a Hilbert space. For A,B two C*-algebras, we write [formula] for the set of all non-degenerate *-homomorphisms A  →  M(B). We call embedding any injective map in [formula]. By subalgebra we mean any non-degenerate inclusion A  ⊆  B of C*-algebras.

We write [formula] for the tensor product between Hilbert spaces or for the minimal tensor product between C*-algebras.

A field of C*-algebras

C0(Y)-algebras

Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Recall that a C0(Y)-algebra is a C*-algebra A together with an embedding of C0(Y) into the center of M(A).

The localisation Ay at y∈Y is the quotient of A by the closed ideal Iy consisting of all fa with [formula] and a∈A.

For a∈A, the image of a in Ay will be written ay.

A C0(Y)-algebra A is called a continuous field of C*-algebras over Y if the map

[formula]

is continuous on Y for all a∈A.

Let [formula] be a Hilbert C0(Y)-module. For y∈Y, we write [formula] for the Hilbert space obtained as the separation-completion of [formula] with respect to the seminorm [formula]. Write ξy for the image of [formula] in [formula].

([\cite=Bla96]) A C0(Y)-representation on [formula] of a C0(Y)-algebra A consists of a C0(Y)-linear element [formula], where [formula] denotes the C*-algebra of compact operators on [formula].

In this situation, π factorizes into representations πy of Ay on the [formula].

([\cite=Bla96]) A C0(Y)-representation π of a C0(Y)-algebra A is called a field of faithful representations if the πy are faithful representations for all y∈Y.

This implies that π itself is faithful since by [\cite=Bla96]

[formula]

A C0(Y)-algebra A is a continuous field of C*-algebras if and only if it admits a field of faithful representations.

This is [\cite=Bla96].

See [\cite=Bla96] and the discussion preceding it.

If A is a C0(Y)-algebra, we say that an automorphism α of A is a C0(Y)-automorphism if α is C0(Y)-linear. For B  ⊆  A an inclusion of C*-algebras, we call conditional expectation of A onto B a B-bilinear completely positive map F:A  →  B of norm 1.

Denote the action of G on A by α. It is immediate that AG is a C0(Y)-subalgebra of A, and that α descends to each fiber Ay.

For each y∈Y, we obtain a *-homomorphism ρ:(AG)y  →  (Ay)G. Let

[formula]

so that F is a faithful conditional expectation of A onto AG. For by∈(Ay)G, we have F(b)∈AG with

[formula]

hence ρ is surjective. On the other hand, if a∈AG and ay = 0 as an element of Ay, then a  =  a'f with a'∈A and [formula]. But then a  =  F(a')f, hence ay = 0 as an element of (AG)y. This shows that ρ is injective, hence a *-isomorphism.

From the above, it follows that for each y we have a faithful conditional expectation

[formula]

leading to a commutative diagram

[formula]

We can then conclude the last statement of the Lemma from the equivalence [\cite=Bla96].

Crossed products with partial automorphisms

We recall some of the results of [\cite=Exe94] in the case of commutative C*-algebras.

Let H be a locally compact space with two open subsets H(1),H( - 1)  ⊆  H together with a homeomorphism

[formula]

We call Θ  =  (θ,H(1),H( - 1)) a partial automorphism of H.

Since H(1) and H( - 1) are open sets in H, we can consider C0(H(1))  ⊆  C0(H) and C0(H( - 1))  ⊆  C0(H) as closed ideals. Then θ gives rise to a *-isomorphism

[formula]

for which we use the same notation θ. The triple Θ  =  (θ,C0(H( - 1)),C0(H(1))) is a partial automorphism of C0(H) in the sense of [\cite=Exe94]. This leads to the crossed product [formula] in the sense of [\cite=Exe94].

To get a more concrete description of [formula], consider more generally for [formula] the open set H(k)  ⊆  H which is the domain of θk, and consider θk as a homeomorphism

[formula]

Consider for [formula] the sets

[formula]

Then [formula] can be turned into a *-algebra by the formulas

[formula]

The C*-algebra [formula] is by definition the universal C*-algebraic envelope of [formula]. Moreover, by [\cite=Exe94] the map

[formula]

is injective. In particular, we have an inclusion [formula]. In the following, we write s0f  =  f for f∈C0(H).

Note that [formula] is naturally a Hilbert bimodule over C0(H) by

[formula]

This Hilbert bimodule completely determines [formula].

This follows from [\cite=AEE98].

Denote by [formula] the circle group.

([\cite=AEE98]) The dual action β of S1 on [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The powers designate the closure of the linear span of k-fold products.

See [\cite=Exe94].

We define F to be the faithful conditional expectation

[formula]

Fields of crossed products

Assume that Y,H are locally compact spaces with [formula] continuous and open. Assume further that Θ  =  (θ,H(1),H( - 1)) is a partial automorphism of H, and assume that [formula]. Write

[formula]

By our assumptions, θ restricts to a homeomorphism θy:H(1)y  →  H( - 1)y, and we obtain a partial homeomorphism Θy  =  (θy,H(1)y,H( - 1)y) of Hy.

By our assumptions, the natural embedding [formula] takes values in the center, so that [formula] is a C0(Y)-algebra. Moreover, the dual action is clearly an action by C0(Y)-automorphisms. Then [formula] is a continuous field of C*-algebras by Lemma [\ref=LemField1], and [formula] is a continuous field of C*-algebras by Lemma [\ref=LemField3].

From the defining relations and Tietze's extension theorem, it is clear that we have a surjective *-homomorphism

[formula]

On the other hand, we also have, by Lemma [\ref=LemField3], a commuting square

[formula]

From the faithfulness of the conditional expectations, it follows that the top map is also isometric, hence a *-isomorphism.

A field of quantum triangular matrices

We will make use of the following notation: for 0 < q < 1 and b > 0, we define

[formula]

For 0 < a < b with [formula], we write

[formula]

We also write, for 0 < a < b,

[formula]

We define

[formula]

This follows since H is closed in [formula].

We write

[formula]

[formula]

We then have a homeomorphism

[formula]

which moreover commutes with the open, surjective projection

[formula]

We are hence in the situation of Section [\ref=SecFieldCross].

We define

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=PropFieldCross], we obtain the following corollary.

In the following, we give a more concrete description of these fibers.

Consider the Hilbert space [formula], whose basis elements we denote by e(n)k with 0  ≤  k  <  n. Write e(n)k,l for the standard matrix units of c0-[formula]. Write D  ⊆  c0-[formula] for the subalgebra of diagonal matrices. Then we have an isomorphism

[formula]

Let

[formula]

where the latter vector is interpreted as zero when ill-defined. Then clearly Skx∈c0-[formula] for x∈D, and it is easily checked by the defining relations of C0(Gq) that the map

[formula]

extends to a *-homomorphism

[formula]

As Hq is a discrete set, one sees by using Dirac functions that ρ is a surjective map. On the other hand, ρ intertwines the faithful conditional expectation F:C0(Gq)  →  C0(Hq) with the natural conditional expectation

[formula]

It follows that ρ is a *-isomorphism.

Consider on [formula] the circle action

[formula]

Then the map

[formula]

is a homeomorphism. Note further that in this case, H(k)1 is the same set H1' for all k  ≠  0, and θ the identity map on H1'. The map ρ restricts to a homeomorphism

[formula]

We can then consider [formula] as S1-invariant functions, and similarly [formula].

Consider on [formula] the measurable functions

[formula]

Write r0 for the identity function on [formula]. Then [formula] for f∈C0(H1'), and we hence obtain a *-homomorphism

[formula]

By Stone-Weierstrass, this map is surjective. As this map intertwines the S1-actions and is isometric on the fixed point algebra, it is also injective, hence an isomorphism.

A field of faithful representations

We keep the notation from the previous section. According to Theorem [\ref=TheoBlanFF], C0(G) must admit a field of faithful representations. In this section, we describe a concrete instance of such a field.

We define I  =  H  ×  S1, and Iq  =  Hq  ×  S1.

Consider on I1 the measure

[formula]

and associated functional

[formula]

where Cc(I1) denotes the space of continuous functions on I1 with compact support.

Let us further endow Cc(Iq) with the positive functional

[formula]

Let f∈Cc(I). Define

[formula]

Then ψ satisfies

[formula]

It is hence sufficient to prove that the restriction of ψ to Cc(H) has range in Cc((0,1]).

But for f∈Cc(H) and 0 < q < 1,

[formula]

Define [formula]. Then we can write

[formula]

We easily see that ψ(f) is continuous on (0,1), with moreover

[formula]

where

[formula]

However, with [formula], we have a diffeomorphism

[formula]

with |JΦ(t,a)|  =  a. Hence

[formula]

This proves that ψ has range in Cc((0,1]).

Of course, the positivity of ψ is immediate, as is the faithfulness, since each ψq is faithful.

We define [formula] to be the Hilbert C0((0,1])-module obtained by completing Cc(I) with respect to the C0((0,1])-valued inner product

[formula]

By definition, we obtain an isometric map Cc(I)q  →  Cc(Iq) sending fq to the restriction of f to Iq. By Tietze's extension theorem, it is surjective. The lemma follows.

The natural projection I  →  H leads to the natural embedding

[formula]

as S1-independent functions. We further denote

[formula]

Then Θ extends to a partial homeomorphism of I by

[formula]

Denote by Z the function

[formula]

It is clear that π is a well-defined representation of C0(H). Furthermore, one easily checks that

[formula]

so that π(sg) extends to a bounded operator on [formula]. An easy computation shows that the defining relations in Proposition [\ref=PropDefRel] are satisfied for the π(f) and π(sg), so that there exists a representation [formula] as above.

To see that it is a field of faithful representations, note that the localisations πq are faithful on the C0(Hq). But each L2(Iq) also carries a continuous representation of S1 by

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows that each πq is faithful.

A field of locally compact quantum groups

Affiliated operators

Let A be a C*-algebra, and [formula] a right Hilbert A-module. Recall that an unbounded operator on [formula] is an A-linear operator

[formula]

with A-invariant dense domain [formula]. One calls an operator T semiregular if it has a densily defined adjoint operator T*. In this case T is automatically closable, and T* is a closed semiregular operator on [formula]. Also the closure of T is again semiregular. One calls T regular if T is closed and semiregular and 1 + T*T is invertible.

([\cite=BaJ83] [\cite=NaW92]) Let A be a C*-algebra. We call the set Aη of all regular operators on A, considered as a right Hilbert A-module over itself, the set of elements affiliated with A. When T∈Aη, we write TηA.

For T∈Aη, the element

[formula]

is called the z-transform of T. If [formula], there exists a unique element π(T)∈Bη such that π(zT)  =  zπ(T).

In general, the affiliation relation is not easy to check. In [\cite=KL11], it was shown how the affiliation relation can be checked locally. The following definition makes sense by [\cite=KL11].

Let A be a C*-algebra, T a semiregular operator on A, and π a representation of A on a Hilbert space H. Then there exists a unique closable, densily defined operator Tπ on H with domain [formula] such that

[formula]

It is easy to see that one then has (T*)π  ⊆  (Tπ)*. The following theorem is proven by combining [\cite=KL11] with [\cite=KL11].

Let A be a C*-algebra. Then a closed semiregular operator T on A is regular (and hence affiliated to A) if and only if (Tπ)* is the closure of (T*)π for all irreducible representations π of A. Moreover, a right A-submodule [formula] is a core for T if and only if [formula] is a core for Tπ for each irreducible representation π of A.

We will need the following particular case. It provides us with a class of C*-algebras for which semiregularity already implies regularity.

Let A be a C*-algebra such that π(A) is unital for each irreducible representation π of A. Then any closed, semiregular operator T on A is regular, and any right A-invariant dense domain of T is a core for T.

Let π be an irreducible representation of A. Then left multiplication by π(T) gives a well-defined, semiregular operator on the unital C*-algebra π(A) with domain [formula]. However, as [formula] is a dense right ideal, it equals π(A). Hence π(T) is a bounded operator. The theorem hence follows from Theorem [\ref=TheoKLOr].

Quantum generating family for C0(G)

In this whole section, we keep the notation from Section [\ref=SecFieldQTM]. Consider the following coordinate functions on H,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then Q is strictly positive and bounded, with bounded inverse, A is positive, unbounded and invertible, and Ω is unbounded and self-adjoint. It is also easily checked that |N|2 and |N*|2 are positive, with H(1) (resp.  H( - 1)) the zero set of |N|2 (resp.  |N*|2). We denote by |N| (resp.  |N*|) the unique positive root of |N|2 (resp.  |N*|2).

More generally, for k  ≥  1 we define |Nk|,|(N*)k|∈C(H) as the functions

[formula]

[formula]

For f∈Cc(H) and k  ≥  1, we define

[formula]

as elements in C0(G).

Note that this is meaningful since |Nk|f∈C0(H(k)) (reading N- 1  =  N*).

We define Cc(G) to be the two-sided *-ideal of C0(G) ge-nerated by Cc(H).

In [\eqref=EqComp], the right hand sides consist of linear combinations of products of elements in the corresponding sets.

Density of Cc(G) in C0(G) follows immediately since Cc(H) is dense in C0(H) and the inclusion C0(H)  ⊆  C0(G) is non-degenerate.

For f∈Cc(H) and g∈C0(H(k)), we have that

[formula]

It follows that {Nkf|f∈Cc(H)} is dense in [formula].

To prove [\eqref=EqComp], pick f∈Cc(H) and choose ε > 0 such that f(q,t,a) = 0 for all (q,t,a) with [formula]. Choose h∈Cc(H) such that h(q,t,a)  =  1 for all (q,t,a) with [formula]. Then for g∈C0(H(k)), it follows that

[formula]

Hence hC0(G)f  =  C0(G)f and so

[formula]

We obtain Cc(G)  =  Cc(H)C0(G). As Cc(G) is *-invariant, the other identity in [\eqref=EqComp] follows.

With a small modification, the proof shows in fact that Cc(G) has local units in Cc(H), that is, for each finite collection [formula] there exists e∈Cc(H) with xi  =  exi  =  xie for all i. In particular, we can write any element in Cc(G) as fx with f∈Cc(H) and x∈C0(G).

We want to interpret the symbol N as an operator affiliated with C0(G).

For f,g∈Cc(H) and x,y∈C0(G), an easy computation shows that

[formula]

Hence there exists a well-defined semiregular operator N with core Cc(G) satisfying [\eqref=EqDefN] and with [formula] satisfying [\eqref=EqDefNstar].

Now since any irreducible representation of C0(G) must factor over some C0(Gq), it follows from Lemma [\ref=LemIrRepq] and Lemma [\ref=LemIrRep1] that all irreducible representations of C0(G) are finite dimensional. By Theorem [\ref=TheoKL] we conclude that N is affiliated to C0(G) and Cc(G) a core for N*.

As the coordinate functions Q±  1,A±  1∈C(H) are affiliated with C0(H), we can also interpret them as elements affiliated with C0(G). It is in fact clear that Cc(G) is also an invariant core for each of these operators. Note that on this common core, these operators then satisfy the relations

[formula]

which, for Q considered a fixed positive real number strictly smaller than 1, are precisely the relations for the quantum group [formula] (up to rescaling).

We will need a small extension of the above result.

The proof is identical to that of Proposition [\ref=PropExN].

The above constructions can also be performed on the localisations C0(Gq), leading to the *-algebra Cc(Gq) and the affiliated operators Nq,AqηC0(Gq) and TqηM2(C0(Gq)). Since Cc(H)q  =  Cc(Hq), we also have that Cc(Gq) is the localisation of Cc(G) at q, and Nq,Aq,Tq are the localisations of N,A,T.

A quantum generating family

We aim to show that the coordinate function Q, together with the operator TηM2(C0(G)) defined in Proposition [\ref=PropExT], is a quantum generating family for C0(G) in the sense of [\cite=Wor95]. We will need some preliminaries.

([\cite=Wor95]) Let A,C be C*-algebras. We say A is generated by (the quantum family of unbounded operators) [formula] if the following holds: for any Hilbert space H, any representation π of A on H and any C*-subalgebra B of B(H), the affiliation [formula] implies that [formula].

Here the separability of A and C is crucial to ensure that this definition satisfies the following, to be expected property.

This follows from [\cite=Wor95].

We will need the following criterion to know whether a quantum family of operators generates a C*-algebra, see [\cite=Wor95].

Assume now that Y is a locally compact Hausdorff space. Note that if A is a C0(Y)-algebra and TηA, then we can make sense of TyηAy since the localisation map is an element of [formula]. Extensions of morphisms defined on generators can then be created from local information as follows.

Here we use the obvious identification [formula], viewing [formula] as a C0(Y)-algebra in the natural way.

Since A,B are separable, we can find, by the identity [\eqref=EqNormSup] under Definition [\ref=DefFaithField], an at most countable subset Y0  ⊆  Y such that the natural non-degenerate maps

[formula]

are faithful. We then want to show there exists a unique arrow φ making the following diagram commute,

where [formula] denotes the bounded direct product of C*-algebras. Also, note that the map [formula] is non-degenerate, hence extends uniquely to [formula].

By direct computation, and using that C passes through direct products by finite-dimensionality, we have

[formula]

so that [formula]. Hence we can apply [\cite=Wor95] to conclude that there exists φ as in the statement of the proposition. Its uniqueness follows from Lemma [\ref=LemSepRep].

In the next lemma, we will need the disintegration of a representation of a C0(Y)-algebra along Y, see [\cite=Dix77].

Assume first that Ty separates representations of Ay for each y. Let π,ρ be two representations of A on a Hilbert space H, and assume that π(S)  =  ρ(S) and [formula]. Then π(f)  =  ρ(f) for all f∈C0(Y). Hence we have disintegrations of the form

[formula]

for some Borel measure μ on Y, where πy and ρy are representations of A which factor over Ay.

As [formula], it follows that [formula] for almost all y. As Ty separates the representations of Ay, this implies, by Lemma [\ref=LemSepRep], πy  =  ρy for almost all y, and hence π  =  ρ.

Conversely, if (S,T) separates representations of A and y∈Y, then any two representations π,ρ of Ay with [formula] lift to representations of A which are equal on (S,T), and hence π  =  ρ.

Let us now return to C0(G) and the operator T from Proposition [\ref=PropExT].

The couple

[formula]

is a quantum generating family for C0(G).

It is immediate that the localisation of T coincides with Tq as defined beneath Proposition [\ref=PropExT]. As the Tq separate representations of C0(Gq) for each q by [\cite=Wor95], it follows by Lemma [\ref=LemSpecLoc] that (Q,T) separates representations of C0(G).

Exactly the same argument as in [\cite=Wor95] shows that there exists an element r∈A satisfying Condition 2 in Lemma [\ref=LemCritWor]. It follows that (Q,T) generates C0(G).

A field of comultiplications

Again we begin this section with some general preliminaries.

([\cite=Bla96]) Let A and B be C0(Y)-algebras over some locally compact space Y, and assume they both admit faithful C0(Y)-representations on respective Hilbert C0(Y)-modules [formula] and [formula]. We define the C0(Y)-tensor product [formula] to be the image of the natural representation of [formula] on the interior tensor product [formula].

One can show [\cite=Bla96] that the C0(Y)-tensor product is independent (up to canonical isomorphism) of the choice of [formula] and [formula]. It is also immediate from the definition that [formula] is then again a C0(Y)-algebra admitting a faithful C0(Y)-representation, and that [formula] satisfies associati-vity in a natural way.

When one of the C0(Y)-algebras is nuclear (as a C*-algebra), one can say a bit more. Note that by [\cite=Bla96] a C0(Y)-algebra A is nuclear if and only if all fibers Ay are nuclear.

Let us now return to C0(G). Note that C0(G), having a faithful conditional expectation onto C0(H), is nuclear. Hence [formula] is a continuous field of C*-algebras with fibers [formula].

We define

[formula]

Write [formula] for the closed subset

[formula]

Then one has an identification

[formula]

leading to an embedding

[formula]

In fact, [formula] has an action of S1  ×  S1 by

[formula]

with [formula] as its fixed point algebra. One may also see [formula] as a crossed product by a partial action of the group [formula] in the sense of [\cite=Mcc95]. The (m,n)th-spectral subspace can be identified with

[formula]

where elements in the right hand side are easily defined by approximation with elementary tensors.

We define [formula] as the ideal in [formula] generated by [formula].

The same argument which was used to prove [\eqref=EqComp] shows that

[formula]

If now [formula], we have for example

[formula]

This allows us to make sense of

[formula]

inside [formula]. Similarly, operators [formula] and [formula] can be defined.

Since any irreducible representation of [formula] splits over some [formula], all of whose irreducible representations are finite dimensional, the proof is identical to that of Proposition [\ref=PropExN].

In fact, the same argument shows that Δ(N) is the closure of the operator [formula] (when suitably defined). Also the next proposition is proven in the same way.

There exists a unique coassociative

[formula]

such that

[formula]

As (Q,T) generates C0(G) by Theorem [\ref=TheoExT], it is, by Proposition [\ref=PropGen], enough to prove that there exists, for each 0 < q  ≤  1, a coassociative morphism

[formula]

such that

[formula]

For 0 < q < 1, this is [\cite=Wor95] and [\cite=PoWo90].

For q = 1, endow [formula] with the multiplication

[formula]

Then G1 is a Lie group, and the functions N1,A1 are precisely the coordinate functions assiociated to the first and second variable. It is easily seen that the associated comultiplication satisfies [\eqref=EqDelq] for q = 1.

Note that at q = 1, we get the locally compact group

[formula]

while at 0 < q < 1, we have that (C0(Gq),Δq) is the discrete quantum group dual of Woronowicz's quantum SUq(2)-group [\cite=Wor87a].

Bisimplifiability

([\cite=Bla96]) Let A be a continuous field of C*-algebras over a locally compact space Y, endowed with a coassociative morphism [formula]. One calls Δ bisimplifiable if

[formula]

where [    ·    ] denotes closed linear span.

Our aim will be to show that the field C0(G) together with its comultiplication constructed in Section [\ref=SecFieldCom] is bisimplifiable. We will make use of the following lemma (which is implicitly used in [\cite=Bla96]).

Assume B  ≠  A. Then the set C of functionals of norm ≤  1 which vanish on B form a convex w*-compact set with more than one point. Hence, by the Krein-Milman theorem, there exists a non-zero extreme functional ω in this set, necessarily of norm 1.

We claim that ω factors over some Ay. Indeed, consider the absolute value |ω|∈A*, which we can extend to a continuous functional on M(A)  ⊆  A*  *. In particular, the restriction |ω||C0(Y) induces a Radon probability measure μ on Y. If then the support of μ consists of more than one point, we can find Borel sets Y1,Y2  ⊆  Y with [formula] and [formula], and with [formula]. Let χS∈C0(Y)*  *  ⊆  A*  * be the characteristic function of a Borel set S. We claim that then

[formula]

is a non-trivial convex combination for ω within C. Indeed, the coefficients form a convex combination since

[formula]

Further, since B is a C0(Y)-module, we have that ω(f    ·    )|B  =  0 for any f∈C0(Y)*  *. Finally, since C0(Y)*  * is central in A*  *, it is easy to see that

[formula]

and so the two functionals in the above convex combination are both in C. This contradicts the extremality of ω.

It follows from the above that |ω|, and hence also ω, factors over some Ay. But since By is dense in Ay, this is impossible.

The field (C0(G),Δ) is bisimplifiable.

As the localisations (C0(Gq),Δq) are either a discrete quantum group or a locally compact group, it follows that the localisations are bisimplifiable. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=LemDens] it suffices to show that

[formula]

We will prove the first inclusion, the second one being similar. In fact, we will show that

[formula]

which is clearly sufficient to prove the statement.

Let 0 < q < 1, and let πn be the nth-dimensional representation of C0(Gq). Let [formula] and 0  ≤  l < r, and let δq;r,l be the Dirac function in Cc(Hq) at the point [formula]. Then it is well known, from the fusion rules for representations of C0(Gq), that [formula] unless r  =  n + m - 2k - 1 with 0  ≤  k  ≤   min {n,m} - 1, in which case it is a one-dimensional projection. In the latter case, choose a unit vector ξ(n,m)q;r,l in its range. From the concrete formula [formula], it follows that we must have

[formula]

and then

[formula]

Pick now 0 < ε < 1, and suppose f,g∈Cc(H) with f(q,t,a) = g(q,t,a) = 0 for min {q,t}  ≤  ε. Then for q  ≤  ε, fq,gq are zero, while for ε  <  q < 1 they are linear combinations of the δq;r,l with 1  ≤  r <  log q(ε) and 0  ≤  l < r. Hence [formula] is zero for q  ≤  ε, and for ε < q < 1 an (infinite) linear combination of elements [formula] where n,m satisfy m <  log q(ε) and |n - m| + 1 <  log q(ε). In particular, no terms appear in which n  ≥  2 log q(ε).

It follows that if h is a function with compact support on H and such that h(q,t,a)  =  1 for min {q,t}  ≥  ε2, then

[formula]

By continuity of the field, this implies [formula], which finishes the proof.

Invariant integral on G

In this section, we prove that (C0(G),Δ) has an associated continuous field of multiplicative unitaries.

Recall the C0((0,1])-linear map ψ on Cc(I) defined in Lemma [\ref=LemContFieldHilb]. By restriction, we can consider it as a map on Cc(H). Let further F:C0(G)  →  C0(H) be the canonical conditional expectation.

As F(x)∈Cc(H) for x∈Cc(G), we can simply define [formula].

In a similar way, we can define the Cc((0,1])-linear map

[formula]

By construction, we have that

[formula]

But one easily verifies that, for 0 < q < 1, the functional ψq' coincides with the right invariant integral for (C0(Gq),Δq), hence the right hand side equals ψq'(fq)gq  =  (ψ'(f)g)q for 0 < q < 1. By continuity (or a direct verification), this also holds at q = 1. Hence [\eqref=EqInvPsi] holds.

Consider now the Hilbert C0((0,1])-module [formula] obtained by completing Cc(G) with respect to the inner product

[formula]

Then the left C0(G)-module structure on Cc(G) extends to a *-representation of C0(G) on [formula].

Similarly, we can consider the completion of [formula] with respect to [formula], and the Hilbert module completion can be identified with [formula].

There exists a unique continuous field of multiplicative unitaries

[formula]

such that

[formula]

The fact that V is a continuous field of multiplicative unitaries simply means that V satisfies the pentagon equation, see [\cite=Bla96].

By Lemma [\ref=LemInvPsi], we find that V exists as an isometry. As the localisations Vq coincide with the right multiplicative unitaries of the locally compact quantum groups (C0(Gq),Δq), it follows that the Vq are unitaries. Hence, using that [formula] is a C0(Y)-algebra with fibers the compact operators on the [formula], we find that

[formula]

satisfies py  =  0 for all y. Hence p = 0, and V a unitary.

The pentagon equation for V follows immediately from its definition.
