Ising Spin Glasses and Renormalization Group Theory : the Binder cumulant

The consequences of the Renormalization Group Theory (RGT) approach have been studied in exquisite detail in numerous regular physical models, typified by the canonical near neighbor interaction ferromagnetic Ising model. It has been tacitly assumed that Edwards-Anderson Ising Spin Glasses (ISGs), where the interactions are random, follow the same basic scaling and Universality rules as the regular models.

The Binder cumulant [\cite=binder:81] is an important observable which has been almost exclusively exploited numerically for its scaling properties as a dimensionless observable very close to criticality in the finite-size scaling (FSS) regime L  ≪  ξ(β), where L is the sample size and ξ(β) the second-moment correlation length at inverse temperature β. Here we will consider its scaling properties in the Thermodynamic limit (ThL) regime L  ≫  ξ(β) where the properties of a finite-size sample if normalized correctly are independent of L and so are the same as those of the infinite-size model.

In Ising ferromagnets, the second field derivative of the susceptibility χ4 in a hypercubic lattice is directly related to the Binder cumulant, see Eq. 10.2 of Ref. [\cite=privman:91], through

[formula]

The susceptibility χ scales with the critical exponent γ, and the critical exponent for the second field derivative of the susceptibility χ4 (also called the non-linear susceptibility), is [\cite=butera:02]

[formula]

because of very basic RGT scaling and hyperscaling relationships between exponents. Explicitly quoting Ref. [\cite=pelissetto:02] : "Below the upper critical dimension, the following hyperscaling relations are supposed to be valid: 2 - α  =  dν, and [formula] where [formula] is the gap exponent, which controls the radius of the disk in the complex-temperature plane without zeroes, i.e. the gap, of the partition function (Yang-Lee theorem)". Then in the ThL regime near criticality the normalized Binder cumulant Ldg(β,L) scales with the critical exponent as (νd  +  2γ)  -  2γ  =  νd.

In any [formula] Ising system the infinite-temperature (i.e. independent spins) limit for the Binder cumulant is [formula], where N is the number of spins; N = Ld for a hypercubic lattice. So the normalized Binder cumulant Ldg(β,L) has an infinite-temperature limit which is strictly 1, and a large L critical limit (with Wegner corrections as for other observables [\cite=wegner:72]):

[formula]

where the scaling variable is chosen as τ  =  1 - β  /  βc following a scaling convention standard for High Temperature scaling expansions (HTSE), see e.g. [\cite=butera:02]. The variable τ is exactly equivalent to the conventional RGT scaling variable t  =  (T - Tc) / Tc at criticality but it is much more convenient at higher temperatures as it tends to 1 at infinite T rather than tending to infinity. Now consider the second-moment correlation length. We will follow the "extended scaling" convention [\cite=campbell:06] and take the normalized correlation length, ξ(β,L) / β1 / 2 in ferromagnets. The ThL normalized correlation length

[formula]

diverges with the standard critical exponent ν at criticality and with this normalization it tends to 1 exactly at infinite temperature τ = 1 for any dimension d. There is a hyperuniversal combination of critical amplitudes, the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant [\cite=butera:02], which with the present conventions then can be written as Gr  =  βd / 2cCg / Cdξ.

In an Ising ferromagnet, if we make a log-log plot of the normalized Binder cumulant y(β)  =  Ldg(β,L) against the normalized correlation length x(β)  =  ξ(β,L) / β1 / 2, the ThL slope will tend to d near criticality and for all L the data will tend to x  =  1, y  =  1 at the infinite-temperature limit. Data taken from numerical simulations in the d = 3 simple cubic Ising ferromagnet [\cite=haggkvist:07] for sample sizes L = 8, 16, 32, 48 are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1], and data from numerical simulations for the d = 2 square lattice Ising ferromagnet, for sample sizes L = 12, 32, 64, 128, 256, are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2]. The ThL regime for each L where the data become independent of L can be identified by inspection. Just as expected from the RGT rule, in the critical large x(β) limit the ThL slope ∂y(β) / ∂x(β)  =  d in both models, and the infinite- temperature limit is x  =  1, y  =  1 at β = 0. In fact the correction terms turn out to be weak so the critical-slope behavior can be seen to set in quite rapidly as the temperature decreases from infinity. Satisfactory overall ThL fits, with T = 1 / β and ξ  =  ξ(β,L),

[formula]

can be obtained in dimension 3 and dimension 2 respectively for the entire paramagnetic region, with the correct limiting exponents d and a single effective correction term. The critical amplitudes estimated from the fits are fully consistent with the accurate tabulated critical amplitudes in Refs. [\cite=butera:02] [\cite=butera:03]. The exponent of the effective correction term 3D is not equal to the known leading correction exponent presumably because leading correction terms happen to cancel out.

These Ising model data are fully consistent with the RGT rule, and incidentally validate once again the utility of the extended scaling normalization of the correlation length for Ising ferromagnet analyses over wide temperature ranges [\cite=campbell:06a] [\cite=campbell:11]. (A "cross-over" behavior of high temperature data in Ising ferromagnets [\cite=luijten:97] is just an artefact [\cite=lundow:11]). It should be noted that neither the value of the inverse critical temperature βc nor the value of the critical exponent ν appear explicitly anywhere in this numerical test of a basic RGT critical scaling relationship.

Now we turn to ISGs. The standard ISG Hamiltonian is [formula] with the near neighbor symmetric distributions normalized to 〈J2ij〉 = 1. The normalized inverse temperature is β  =  (〈J2ij〉 / T2)1 / 2. The Ising spins live on simple hyper-cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The spin overlap parameter is defined as usual by

[formula]

where A and B indicate two copies of the same system. Klein et al [\cite=klein:91] quote exactly the same hyperscaling relation Eq. [\eqref=gam4] for χ4 in the ISGs as in the Ising ferromagnets (with the spin overlap moments 〈q2〉 and 〈q4〉 replacing the magnetization moments 〈m2〉 and 〈m4〉), so the RGT prediction for the ISG Binder cumulant critical exponent is again γ4  -  2γ  =  dν. Because the interaction parameter in the ISGs is 〈J2ij〉 the appropriate ISG scaling variable is τ  =  1 - (β  /  βc)2 [\cite=daboul:04] and the appropriate normalized correlation length is ξ(τ,L) / β [\cite=campbell:06]. Following just the same procedure as for the ferromagnetic Ising models, Figs. [\ref=fig3] to [\ref=fig4] show log-log plots of y(β)  =  Ldg(β,L) against x(β)  =  ξ(β,L) / β for dimension d = 5, whereas Figs. [\ref=fig5] to [\ref=fig8] show linear plots of y(x)  =  Ldg(τ,L) / (ξ(τ,L) / β)d against x  =  τ for dimensions d = 4 and 3. This latter form visually highlights the fact that in these dimensions the ThL envelope of this ratio is tending to diverge as criticality is approached with increasing L. The plots are based on data from numerical simulations on ISGs with bimodal (J), Gaussian (G), and Laplacian (L) interaction distributions.

The details of the simulation method are given in Refs. [\cite=lundow:15] [\cite=lundow:15a]. The maximum sizes studied were L = 10 in dimension 5, L = 14 for the bimodal model and L = 12 for the Gaussian and Laplacian models in dimension 4, and L = 24 for the bimodal model in dimension 3. Means were taken over 213  =  8192 samples. The sizes studied were limited by practical considerations; averages must be taken over large numbers of samples to obtain reliable data and equilibration requires long runs for large samples. If the RGT expressions are valid in ISGs, the critical limit slope ∂ ln y(β) / ∂ ln x(β) should again be equal to d in each dimension.

The best fits with one effective scaling correction term for the different models are shown in the figures. For the 5D bimodal and Gaussian model (Figs. [\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig4]), with ξ  =  ξ(β,L) and T = 1 / β,

[formula]

For the 4D bimodal, Gaussian (with a negligible correction term) and Laplacian model (see Figs. [\ref=fig5] to [\ref=fig7]),

[formula]

and for the 3D bimodal model, with a weak correction term (see Fig. [\ref=fig8]),

[formula]

The exponent estimated from the numerical data is indeed equal to 5.0(1)  ~  d in the dimension five models, which is consistent with the RGT prediction for this dimension. However, in dimension four the estimated ISG exponents are 4.72(5),4.59(3) and 4.63(5) for the three models, which are not equal to d  =  4. The estimate is the most accurate for the Gaussian model where the correction term happens to be negligible. In dimension three the estimated exponent for the bimodal ISG model, again with a weak correction term, is 3.67(5), not d = 3.

Once again, neither the values of the critical temperatures nor the values of the critical exponents ν are involved in these estimations. The figures display raw data and the extrapolations to the critical slopes are simple, so systematic errors are minimal and the estimates should be reliable. The values for the different ISG models in dimension 4 are similar (but may not be identical) although the correction terms in the different models are not at all the same.

From RGT the critical scaling rule ∂y(β) / ∂x(β)  =  d should be obeyed as a strict equality in all systems below the upper critical dimension. However, the scaling relation is based on the assumption that the standard Josephson hyperscaling rule [\cite=josephson:66] holds. The derivations leading to this rule assume translational invariance (see [\cite=muller:15]). It is well established that in the Random Field Ising model (RFIM), which is not translationally invariant, the hyperscaling rule 2 - α  =  β + 2γ  =  νd is replaced by 2 - α  =  β + 2γ  =  ν(d - θ) ; θ is a hyperscaling violation exponent and it is believed that θ  =  γ  /  ν (two exponent scaling) in the RFIM [\cite=gofman:93] [\cite=vink:10]. ISGs are not translationally invariant either. In ISGs α is always negative and very large, and so is never estimated directly. The ISG Binder cumulant scaling behavior reported here provides an alternative test of hyperscaling and indicates hyperscaling violations analogous to those observed in the RFIM.

We conclude empirically that the basic RGT scaling law with the standard Josephson hyperscaling rule does not hold in ISGs, at least in dimensions 3 and 4. It may be relevant that for spin glasses the situation concerning the “gap” exponent referred to above is more complicated than for ferromagnets, or even diluted ferromagnets, as the locations of Yang-Lee zeros are not restricted to the imaginary-field axis [\cite=matsuda:10].

It has been generally accepted that RGT implies that in ISGs critical exponents and the values of dimensionless parameters at criticality should be universal, whatever the form of the interaction distribution. Numerically this RGT universality rule also has been shown not to hold, for ISGs in dimension 4 [\cite=lundow:15] [\cite=lundow:15a] and dimension 2 [\cite=lundow:15b].

However, it has been authoritatively stated that classical tools of RGT analysis are not suitable for spin glasses [\cite=parisi:01] [\cite=castellana:11] [\cite=angelini:13]. The numerical results taken together indeed appear to be a clear empirical indication that a fundamentally novel theoretical approach is required for scaling at spin glass transitions.
