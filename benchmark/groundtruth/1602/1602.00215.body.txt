On the implementation of CVC in weak charged-current proton-neutron transitions

It has been argued in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj] that the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis [\cite=Feynman:1958ty] implies a vector current in weak charged-current proton-neutron transitions which is different than the usual one (see, for example, Ref. [\cite=Giunti:2007ry]).

Let us consider the inverse neutron decay process considered in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj]:

[formula]

The vector part of the hadronic matrix element has the general form (see, for example, Ref. [\cite=Giunti:2007ry])

[formula]

where [formula] is the average nucleon mass, q  =  pn  -  pn is the four momentum transfer and vμ(x) is the vector part of the quark charged current:

[formula]

The form factors F1(q2), F2(q2) and F3(q2) are called, respectively, vector, weak magnetism and scalar. The scalar form factor F3(q2) is generated by a second-class current [\cite=Weinberg:1958ut] and is well-known to vanish under the CVC hypothesis, which is a consequence of the invariance of strong interactions under isospin transformations (see, for example, Ref. [\cite=Giunti:2007ry]). The scalar form factor F3(q2) has also been severely limited experimentally. A recent survey of superallowed nuclear β decays in which q2 is very small found [\cite=Hardy:2014qxa]

[formula]

In Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj] second class currents are claimed to be neglected, but it is argued that the CVC hypothesis leads to an additional term multiplying F1(q2) in Eq. ([\ref=m1]). It is shown in the following that this additional term is just the second class current that was supposed to be neglected, leading to a contradiction.

The implementation of the CVC hypothesis in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj] is done by assuming the current conservation relation

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Then, from Eq. ([\ref=m1]) we get the constraint

[formula]

Inserting this value of F3 in Eq. ([\ref=m1]), we obtain

[formula]

This is the expression for the matrix element 〈n(pn)|vμ(0)|p(pp)〉 which is claimed in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj] to be correct under the CVC hypothesis.

Note the contradiction with the initial statement in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj] that the contribution F3 of second class currents is neglected. Moreover, it is clear that Eq. ([\ref=m2]) cannot be correct, because:

The CVC hypothesis based on the invariance of strong interactions under isospin transformations implies that F3(q2) = 0, not the value in Eq. ([\ref=cvce3]).

The value of F3(0) in Eq. ([\ref=cvce3]) diverges at q2  →  0, in sharp contradiction with the experimental bound in Eq. ([\ref=f3exp]). For example, in neutron decay we have q2  ~  (mn  -  mp)2 and Eq. ([\ref=cvce3]) would give |F3(0)|  ~  0.4mN|F1(0)|  /  me.

Then, one can ask what is wrong with the argument in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj]. The mistake is in assuming the exact validity of the current conservation relation ([\ref=cvce1]), which is not correct, because isospin symmetry is broken by the mass difference of the u and d quarks and by electromagnetic interactions. Indeed, one can find that

[formula]

where e is the elementary electric charge and Aμ(x) is the electromagnetic field.

Therefore, one can use the current conservation relation ([\ref=cvce1]) only in the approximation of exact isospin invariance, which is equivalent to neglect the difference of the proton and neutron masses in Eq. ([\ref=cvce3]), leading to the correct well-known CVC result F3(q2) = 0.

In conclusion, I have shown that the standard expression of the vector part of the hadronic matrix element in weak charged-current proton-neutron transitions is in agreement with the CVC hypothesis, contrary to the claim in Ref. [\cite=Ankowski:2016oyj].
