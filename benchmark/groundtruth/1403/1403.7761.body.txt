Binomial discrete time ruin probability with Parisian delay

In risk theory we usually consider the classical risk process:

[formula]

where u > 0 denotes the initial reserve, t = 1,2,3,... and

[formula]

We assume that Yi,(i = 1,2,...) are i.i.d distributed claims. We will denote [formula] for [formula] and we will assume [formula], hence Rt  →    +    ∞   a.s. Risk process starts from R0 = u and later we will use convention [formula] and [formula].

One of the most important characteristics in a risk theory is a finite-time ruin probability defined by [formula] for the ruin time T0  =   inf {t  ≥  0:Rt  ≤  0}. In this paper we extend this notion to so-called Parisian ruin probability, that occurs if the process X stays below zero for a longer period than a fixed [formula]. Formally, we define Parisian ruin time by:

[formula]

and we consider Parisian ruin probabilities [formula] and [formula].

The case ζ = 0 corresponds to classical ruin problem and we do not deal with this case here. The name for this problem is borrowed from Parisian option, where prices are activated or canceled depending on type of option if underlying asset stays above or below barrier long enough in a row (see [\cite=Hansjoerg] [\cite=chesneyetal] [\cite=DassWu1]). We believe that Parisian ruin probability could be a better measure of risk in many situations giving possibility for insurance company to get solvency. So far the Parisian ruin probability has been considered only in a continuous-time setting. In particular, Dassios and Wu [\cite=DassWu1] analyze the classical risk process ([\ref=CL]) with exponential claims and for the Brownian motion with drift. Dassios and Wu [\cite=DassWu2] found also Cramér-type asymptotics for this risk process. Czarna and Palmowski [\cite=IZ] and Loeffen et al. [\cite=RIZ] extended these results to the case of a general spectrally negative Lévy process using the fluctuation theory (see also [\cite=Land2] concerning an exponential Parisian delay). The main goal of this paper is to derive discrete-time counterparts of above results and propose efficient numerical procedure of finding Parisian finite-time ruin probability.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sections [\ref=sec:main] and [\ref=sec:infinite] we give main representation of Parisian ruin probabilities. In Sections [\ref=sec:cram] and [\ref=sec:heavy] we give asymptotics of Parisian ruin probability both in Cramér and heavy-tailed cases. Finally, in Section [\ref=sec:examples] we analyze a few particular examples.

We will use the following facts: Proof  See [\cite=le].   [formula]

Proof  The first equality is a straightforward consequence of Markov property. The second equality follows from decomposition of a trajectory of Rn into two parts and using [\cite=le].   [formula] Let

[formula]

The main representation is given in the next theorem. Proof  The statement for t  ≤  ζ + 1 is obvious. For t  ≥  ζ + 2 the Parisian ruin will occur after time t if and only if one of two separate scenarios will happen. In the first one the classical ruin time T0 will happen after time t - ζ. In the second scenario we can decompose possible trajectory that will go below zero into two parts: one up to recovery time and one after it. Precisely, the first piece of this trajectory at the moment of classical ruin time [formula] has the undershoot of 0 of size, say, - z < 0 and then it continues to level 1. This excursion from - z must have length ω  <  ζ. Otherwise we will have Parisian ruin before time t. The second part of the above mentioned trajectory starts at 1 and avoids Parisian ruin over the left period of time up to t, namely t - ω - s. This observation and the strong Markov property will produce formula ([\ref=finite]). Equality ([\ref=Kendall]) follows from Kendall�s identity for a random walk having property that it can jump over previous maxima by 1 (see [\cite=Feller], [\cite=alilietal] and [\cite=bertbook]).   [formula]

To compute probability given in ([\ref=finite]) for u  ≥  2 we start from counting [formula] using the algorithm given in Theorem [\ref=ThmMain] for u = 1.

Infinite-time horizon

Proof  See [\cite=le].   [formula]

Proof  Taking limit t  →    ∞   in formula ([\ref=finite]) produces equation:

[formula]

where [formula] is given in Fact [\ref=infty_Loisel]. Now we can use the following identity

[formula]

to get ([\ref=infinite]). To obtain ([\ref=foru=1]) we apply ([\ref=infinite]) with u = 1.   [formula]

Cramér's estimate

In this section we derive the exponential asymptotics of the Parisian ruin probability.

For all β  ≥  0 we define moment-generating function [formula], where Y is a generic claim size and [formula] is expectation with respect of [formula]. We will consider also dual random walk R̂n =  - Rn with a generic increment U = Y - 1. Note that [formula]. Let L̂- 1n be the number of times new maxima are reached within n steps of R̂, L̂n  =   inf {k  ≥  1:L̂- 1k = n} be the number of steps required to achieve n new maxima and Ĥn  =  R̂L̂n be the n-th new maxima of R̂. In other words, let [formula] be a ladder height process of R̂.

Assume Cramér conditions that there exists γ > 0 satisfying:

[formula]

and that

[formula]

From [\cite=asmappliedprob] (in a lattice version) we can get the following Cramér asymptotics of classical ruin probability. Proof  It suffices to prove that

[formula]

For process R we can define weakly ascending height process [formula]. Note that H1 = (1 - p0)δ0 + p0δ1. From the Wiener-Hopf factorization [\cite=asmappliedprob]:

[formula]

Moreover from ([\ref=baxter2]) with [formula] we have

[formula]

Taking derivative at θ =  - γ of the above equation ([\ref=baxter2]) and plugging this result and ([\ref=baxter]) into the right-hand side of the equation ([\ref=stalaC]) completes the proof.   [formula]

Moreover, we can get also the following fact. Proof  Observe first that:

[formula]

where [formula]. Define Esscher transform via:

[formula]

for any c for which [formula], where [formula] is the exponential martingale under [formula]. From [\cite=asmappliedprob] we have also that

[formula]

From [\cite=asmappliedprob] we have that

[formula]

Identity ([\ref=baxter2]) completes now the proof.   [formula]

Let Φ(  ·  ) be the inverse of φ. We are ready now to state the main result of this section.

Proof  To find Cramér asymptotics ([\ref=cas]) we use equations ([\ref=cas]) and ([\ref=infinite]), Fact [\ref=Feller] for the function

[formula]

To prove ([\ref=LTfk]) note that by summing-by-parts formula:

[formula]

where we use Optional Stopping Theorem to the martingale [formula] and τz. Hence

[formula]

[formula]

Heavy-tailed estimate

In this section we will assume that generic claim size has a heavy-tailed distribution. In particular, we assume that the distribution [formula] of Y belongs to the class S(α). That class is defined as follows.

(Class L(α), lattice case of span 1) For a parameter α  ≥  0 we say that distribution function G on [formula] with tail [formula] belongs to class L(α) if

[formula] for each [formula],

[formula]

(Class S(α), lattice case of span 1) We say that G belongs to class S(α) if

G∈L(α),

[formula],

for some M0  <    ∞  , we have

[formula]

where [formula] and *   denotes convolution.

Let [formula] and [formula], [formula]. From now on we will assume that either

[formula]

or

[formula]

Proof  For the case α = 0 observe that the ruin probability [formula] equals the ruin probability for the classical renewal risk process in a continuous time with interarrival time equal 1 and the generic claim size Y. [\cite=Assbook] (see also [\cite=Serdimastan]) completes the proof of the first part of the proof. The case of α > 0 follows from [\cite=BertDon2] and [\cite=asmappliedprob] with

[formula]

Identities ([\ref=baxter]) and ([\ref=baxter2]) complete the proof.   [formula]

Observe that

[formula]

where

[formula]

for a compound Poisson process [formula] and Nt being independent of {Yi} Poisson process with intensity 1. Similarly,

[formula]

From [\cite=KyprKlup] we have that

Note that by Definition [\ref=def2](ii) for α > 0 we have [formula] and [formula].

We can now state the main result of this section. Proof  The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=Crameras], where we use Fact [\ref=andreas] instead of Fact [\ref=Feller].   [formula]

Note that the Parisian delay have influence on the heavy-tailed asymptotics of the ruin probability only when α > 0. The subexponential case gives the same asymptotics which is a consequence of the big claim that cause the ruin.

Examples

In this section we use Theorem [\ref=ThmMain] to calculate the Parisian probability. We compare it with Monte Carlo algorithm. We also consider different initial capitals and Parsisian delays.

Example 1. We will assume that claim size Y has a binomial distribution B(3;0.3).

At the beginning we take u = 5 (initial capital), ζ = 3 (Parisian delay), t = 20 (time horizon). With such a setup we will show in Table [\ref=tabela1] the efficiency of recursive algorithm given in of Theorem [\ref=ThmMain].

Note that for t = 20 we have approximately the same computation time when we use Theorem [\ref=ThmMain] and Monte Carlo method with 25600 paths. The suggested algorithm given in Theorem [\ref=ThmMain] gives hence very promising results. Next Table [\ref=tabela2] identifies Parisian non-ruin probability for different t  ≤  26.

Results of above Table we also presented on Figure [\ref=rys2].

Similar result could be derived for the Parisian non-ruin probability with different initial capital; see Table [\ref=tabela3] and Figure [\ref=rys3].

Above calculations show that formula given in Theorem [\ref=ThmMain] can produce deep comparison results for very wide choice of parameters. Finally we show how the Parisian non-ruin probability changes when change Parisian delay, see Table [\ref=tabela4].

Above table shows that increasing of the Parisian delay can substantially decrease the ruin probability keeping initial capital fixed.

Example 2. To compare Parisian ruin probability for different distributions we choose now negative binomial distribution [formula] for modelling a generic claim size Y.

Again at the beginning we take u = 5 (initial capital), ζ = 3 (Parisian delay), t = 20 (time horizon) and analyze the efficiency of recursive algorithm given in of Theorem [\ref=ThmMain].

What is surprising here the Parisian ruin probability is substantially larger. It means that the choice of the distribution of the generic claim size is crucial for its determining.

In the following tables and figures we show how the Parisian non-ruin probability changes for different time horizons (Table [\ref=tabela6] and Figure [\ref=rys6]), different initial capitals (Table [\ref=tabela7] and Figure [\ref=rys7]) and different Parisian delays (Table [\ref=tabela8]). Here the ruin probability quicker decreases with increase of the initial capital, Parisian delay.
