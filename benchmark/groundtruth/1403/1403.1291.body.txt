A generalization of a result of Dong and Santos-Sturmfels on the Alexander dual of spheres and balls

Introduction

Let K be a finite simplicial complex. Fix a ground set of vertices V which contains the set VK of vertices of K, and let Δ denote the simplex spanned by V. The classical Alexander duality theorem admits a combinatorial formulation in terms of a simplicial homotopy representative K*  V of |∂Δ| - |K| called the Alexander dual of K. In this form the theorem asserts that Hi(K)≃Hn - i - 3(K*  V), where n is the cardinal of V and both homology and cohomology groups are reduced (see [\cite=Mu] and [\cite=BjTa]). In light of this result, it is natural to ask if the homotopy type of K can also be deduced from K*  V. Unfortunately this is generally not the case. There are canonical examples of contractible polyhedra and homotopy spheres whose Alexander duals are not respectively contractible or homotopy equivalent to spheres. Moreover, it can be shown that for any finitely presented group G there is a finite simply connected complex K such that π1(K*  V) = G (see [\cite=MR]). In 2002, Dong [\cite=Dong] proved that the Alexander dual of a simplicial sphere has again the homotopy type of a sphere. One year later Santos and Sturmfels [\cite=SS] showed that the Alexander duals of simplicial balls are contractible spaces. Dong's approach relies mainly on convexity and Santos-Sturmfels' proof uses Dong's result on spheres. Both results evidence that a locally well-behaved structure on the complex forces homotopy stableness on its dual and one may ask whether other manifold-like constructions can hold similar properties.

The NH-manifolds are natural candidates for this. These complexes were recently introduced in [\cite=CM] as a generalization of combinatorial manifolds to the non-homogeneous setting (or, more precisely, to the non-necessarily homogeneous setting). The study of NH-manifolds was in part motivated by the theory of non-pure shellability due to Björner and Wachs [\cite=BjWa]. It was also shown in [\cite=CM] that they appear when investigating Pachner moves between manifolds: if two polyhedral manifolds (with or without boundary) are PL-homeomorphic then they are related by a finite sequence of factorizations involving NH-manifolds.

In this paper we prove a generalization of the results of Dong and Santos-Sturmfels to non-necessarily homogeneous balls and spheres. Concretely, we show that the Alexander dual of an NH-ball is a contractible space and the Alexander dual of an NH-sphere is homotopy equivalent to a sphere (Theorems [\ref=teo_main_for_NH-balls] and [\ref=teorema_esferas_completo] below). These results extend considerably the previous ones. Our approach is based on the local structure of theses polyhedra and, as a by-product, we exhibit an alternative and simple proof of the original results which relies on the local nature of the manifolds, in contrast to the previous treatments.

The second aim of this article is to use the theory of NH-manifolds to characterize the (topological, simplicial) structure of the Alexander duals of balls and spheres in the following sense. Given a subspace A of the d-sphere Sd, since the complement B = Sd - A is also a subspace of Sd' for any d'  ≥  d, it is natural to study the relationship between A and Sd' - B (the complement of its complement in a sphere of higher dimension). In the combinatorial setting, this amounts to understand the double dual L = (K*  V)*  V' where [formula]. We prove that the double duals of balls (resp. spheres) are NH-balls (resp. NH-spheres).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section two we recall the basic properties of classical combinatorial manifolds and NH-manifolds and prove a result on the existence of spines for NH-manifolds with boundary. This result is used in the proofs of the main theorems but it is also interesting in its own right.

In section three we compare the Alexander duals of a complex with respect to different ground sets of vertices and characterize the Alexander double duals of balls and spheres. As a corollary we show that NH-balls and NH-spheres appear as double duals of (classical) balls and spheres.

In the last section of the article we prove the generalization of Dong's and Santos-Sturmfels' results on the Alexander dual of spheres and balls to the non-homogeneous setting.

Preliminaries

Basic notations

All complexes considered in this paper are finite. Given a set of vertices V, |V| will denote its cardinality and Δ(V) the simplex spanned by the vertices of V. [formula] will denote a generic d-simplex and ∂Δd its boundary. The set of vertices of a complex K will be denoted VK and we set ΔK  =  Δ(VK). We write σ  <  τ when σ is a face of τ and [formula] when it is an immediate face. A simplex is maximal or principal in a complex K if it is not a proper face of any other simplex of K. A ridge of K is an immediate face of a principal simplex. Two simplices σ,τ∈K are adjacent if [formula] is an immediate face of σ or τ.

As usual [formula] will denote the join of the complexes K and L. By convention, if [formula] is the empty simplex and [formula] the complex containing only the empty simplex then [formula] and [formula]. For σ∈K, [formula] denotes its link and [formula] its (closed) star. The union of two complexes K,L will be denoted by K + L. A subcomplex L  ⊂  K is said to be top generated if every principal simplex of L is also principal in K.

We write K≃PLL when K and L are PL-homeomorphic; that is, whenever they have a subdivision in common. We shall frequently identify a complex K with its geometric realization and we shall write K≃L when K is homotopy equivalent to L.

Given t  ≥  0, [formula] will denote the simplicial t-fold (unreduced) suspension of K.

A principal simplex τ∈K is collapsible in K if there is a ridge [formula] which is not a face of any other simplex of K (i.e. σ is a free face). If τ is collapsible, the operation which transforms K into K - {τ,σ} is called an elementary (simplicial) collapse and is denoted by [formula]. It is easy to see that K - {τ,σ}  ⊂  K is a strong deformation retract. The inverse operation is called an elementary (simplicial) expansion. If there is a sequence [formula] we say that K collapses to L (or equivalently, L expands to K) and write [formula] or [formula]. A complex K is collapsible if it has a subdivision which collapses to a single vertex.

Combinatorial manifolds

We recall some basic definitions and properties of the classical theory of combinatorial manifolds. For a comprehensive exposition of the subject we refer the reader to [\cite=Gla] [\cite=Hud] [\cite=Lic].

A combinatorial d-ball is a complex which is PL-homeomorphic to Δd. A combinatorial d-sphere is a complex PL-homeomorphic to ∂Δd + 1. By convention, [formula] is considered a sphere of dimension - 1. A combinatorial d-manifold is a complex M such that lk(v,M) is a combinatorial (d - 1)-ball or (d - 1)-sphere for every v∈VM. It is easy to verify that d-manifolds are homogeneous complexes of dimension d; that is, all of its principal simplices are d-dimensional. The link of any simplex in a manifold is also a ball or a sphere and the class of combinatorial manifolds is closed under PL-homeomorphisms. In particular, combinatorial balls and spheres are combinatorial manifolds. By a result of J.H.C. Whitehead, combinatorial d-balls are precisely the collapsible combinatorial d-manifolds (see [\cite=Gla]) and by a result of Newman, if S is a combinatorial d-sphere containing a combinatorial d-ball B, then the closure [formula] is a combinatorial d-ball (see [\cite=Gla] [\cite=Hud] [\cite=Lic]).

The boundary ∂M of a combinatorial d-manifold M can be regarded as the set of simplices whose links are combinatorial balls. This coincides with the usual definition of boundary for d-homogeneous complexes as the subcomplex generated by the mod 2 sum of the (d - 1)-simplices. It is easy to see that ∂M is a (d - 1)-combinatorial manifold without boundary.

A weak d-pseudomanifold without boundary is a d-homogeneous simplicial complex P satisfying that each (d - 1)-simplex is contained in exactly two d-simplices. It is easy to see that in this case lk(σ,P) is a weak (d -  dim (σ) - 1)-pseudomanifold for every σ∈P and that [formula], since the mod 2 sum of the d-simplices of P is a generating cycle. A d-pseudomanifold is a weak d-pseudomanifold with or without boundary (i.e. the (d - 1)-simplices are contained in at most two d-simplices) which is strongly connected; that is, any two d-simplices σ,τ can be connected by a sequence of d-simplices [formula] such that [formula] is (d - 1)-dimensional for each [formula] (i.e. ηi and ηi + 1 are adjacent). It is easy to see that a connected combinatorial d-manifold is a d-pseudomanifold.

Non-homogeneous manifolds

NH-manifolds are the non-homogeneous versions of combinatorial manifolds and play a key role in this work. We give next a brief summary of the subject and refer the reader to [\cite=CM] for a more detailed exposition.

NH-manifolds have a local structure consisting of Euclidean spaces of varying dimensions. In Figure [\ref=fig:ejemplos_nh_variedades] we exhibit some examples of NH-manifolds.

In [\cite=CM] it is proved that NH-manifolds satisfy many (generalized) results of the classical theory of combinatorial manifolds. Also, by [\cite=CM], homogeneous NH-manifolds are standard combinatorial manifolds. We next summarize the relevant results of this theory that will be used in this article.

The pseudoboundary M of an NH-manifold is the set of simplices whose links are NH-balls (this is not in general a simplicial complex). The boundary ∂M is the simplicial complex generated by the simplices in M. By [\cite=CM], M is a complex if and only if M is homogeneous. This implies that boundaryless NH-manifolds are classical (combinatorial) manifolds. This shows that, unlike classical manifolds, NH-spheres which are non-homogeneous do have boundary. By [\cite=CM] if S = B + L is a decomposition of an NH-sphere then lk(σ,S) is an NH-sphere with decomposition lk(σ,B) + lk(σ,L) for every σ∈L.

Given an NH-manifold M, we denote by [formula] the relative interior of M, which is the set of simplices whose links are NH-spheres (of any dimension).

The following is a special case of [\cite=CM], which is a generalization of the classical Alexander's theorem on regular expansions (see [\cite=Lic]).

The next two results, which are interesting in their own right, will be used in the last section of the article.

Let M be a connected NH-manifold of dimension d such that [formula]. Then, M is a combinatorial d-manifold (without boundary). In particular, if S is an NH-sphere with dim h(S) =  dim (S) then S is a combinatorial sphere.

By [\cite=CM] it suffices to prove that M is homogeneous. Let c be a generating d-cycle of [formula] and let K  ⊂  M be the subcomplex generated by the d-simplices appearing in c with nonzero coefficients. We shall show that M = K. Note that since K  ⊂  M is top generated and M is an NH-pseudomanifold (see Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_nh-pseudo]) then K is a weak pseudomanifold without boundary (since c is a cycle). If M  ≠  K, let η∈M - K be a principal simplex adjacent to K and set [formula]. Since by dimensional considerations [formula] then lk(ρ,M) = lk(ρ,M - η) + lk(ρ,η) is an NH-sphere of homotopy dimension 0. But lk(ρ,K)  ⊂  lk(ρ,M - η) is a weak pseudomanifold without boundary and hence [formula]. This contradicts the fact that lk(ρ,M - η) is an NH-ball since a generating cycle in lk(ρ,K) is also generating in lk(ρ,M - η). Note also that [formula].

The Alexander double dual of balls and spheres

The Alexander dual with respect to different ground sets of vertices

We first study the relationship between the Alexander dual of a complex relative to its own set of vertices and to a bigger ground set of vertices. This is a natural question since geometrically it amounts to analyze the relation between the complement of a complex when seen as subspace of spheres of different dimensions.

For a complex K we denote K*  =  {σ∈ΔK  |  σcVK∉K} the Alexander dual with respect to the ground set VK. Here σcVK  =  Δ(VK - Vσ) is the complement of σ in VK. Now, for a vertex set V  ⊇  VK we consider the simplex τ  =  Δ(V - VK) and we denote the Alexander dual of K relative to V by Kτ; that is, Kτ  =  {η∈Δ(V)  |  ηcV∉K} where ηcV  =  Δ(V - Vη) is the complement of η with respect to [formula]. We will omit the subscript VK or V in the complement when that is clear from the context. Note that if [formula] then Kτ = K* is the Alexander dual of K relative to its own set of vertices.

We shall use the following convention regarding the Alexander dual of simplices and boundary of simplices: [formula] and [formula].

Note that the equation in (4) also holds for [formula] taking t = 0.

Alexander double duals of balls and spheres

Suppose A is a subspace of the d-sphere Sd. The complement B = Sd - A is also a subspace of Sd' for any d'  ≥  d and taking into account that Sd - B = A it is natural to ask what kind of relationship exists between A and Sd' - B. In the simplicial setting this amounts to understand the similarities between a complex K and (Kτ)σ for [formula] and [formula]. We call the complex (Kτ)σ a double dual of K. When [formula] we call (K*)* = K*  * the standard double dual of K.

Double duals share many of the properties of the original complexes. For example, it is easy to see from formula [\eqref=eq_formula_central] of Lemma [\ref=lema_formula_central] and Lemmas [\ref=lema_formula_central] and [\ref=lema_de_cantidad_de_vertices] that (Kτ)σ≃ΣtK for some t  ≥  0 if |VK|  ≥  d + 3. Also, it can be shown that a complex K is shellable if and only if (Kτ)σ is shellable. We are mainly interested in double duals of combinatorial balls and spheres and we shall show that they are precisely the NH-balls and NH-spheres. The result basically follows from the following

Put Δ  =  Δ(V). If L is an NH-ball or NH-sphere then K = lk(η,L) is either an NH-ball or NH-sphere by Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_link_is_bola_o_esfera]. Since [formula] and [formula] are collapsible and [formula] then K will be an NH-ball if L is one and an NH-sphere if L is one.

Suppose K is an NH-ball or NH-sphere. By Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_join_de_balls_and_spheres], [formula] is a combinatorial ball, [formula] is an NH-ball and [formula] is an NH-ball or NH-sphere according to K. We use Theorem [\ref=Alexander_for_NH-manifolds] to prove that L is an NH-ball or NH-sphere. Note that [formula] is trivially contained in [formula] and it is generated by ridges of [formula]. Also, if [formula] and [formula] denotes the barycenter of η then

[formula]

which is an NH-ball by Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_pl_close]. This implies that [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=Alexander_for_NH-manifolds], L is an NH-ball or NH-sphere.

We first prove the case [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lema_de_cantidad_de_vertices] we may assume |VK| =  dim (K) + 2. Let [formula] so [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lema_formula_central] [\eqref=item_K_dual_rho_=_K]. The result now follows from the previous lemma.

If K is a simplex and dim (τ) = 0 the result is trivial. For the remaining cases we have and the result follows from the previous lemma and the case [formula].

It is known that a d-homogeneous complex with d + 2 vertices is either the boundary of a simplex or an elementary starring of a simplex (see [\cite=Mani]) but for a general d-dimensional complex with d + 2 vertices not even its homotopy type can be known beforehand. However, when the complex is an NH-manifold then it is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere. Actually, the next stronger result holds.

If M is an NH-manifold of dimension d and d + 2 vertices then M is an NH-ball or NH-sphere.

By Lemma [\ref=lema_de_cantidad_de_vertices] [formula] and by Lemma [\ref=lema_formula_central]

[formula]

If M* is a simplex then [formula] is an NH-ball. Otherwise, since M is an NH-manifold then M*  * = lk(ρ,M) must be an NH-ball or NH-sphere by Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_link_is_bola_o_esfera]. Therefore M is an NH-ball or an NH-sphere by Theorem [\ref=teorema_principal_1_double_dual].

Main results

In this section we generalize Dong's result on the Alexander dual of simplicial spheres [\cite=Dong] and Santos-Sturmfels' result on simplicial balls [\cite=SS] to the more general setting of NH-spheres and NH-balls. First we need some lemmas. For v∈VK, [formula] denotes the deletion of v.

The following result is standard.

The following is a rewriting of [\cite=MR].

We are now able to give an alternative proof of Dong's and Santos-Sturmfels' original results.

By Lemma [\ref=lema_formula_central] [\eqref=item_K_tau_es_suspension_de_K] it suffices to prove the result for [formula]. We first prove it for a combinatorial ball B by induction on d  ≥  1. If d = 1 then B collapses to a 1-ball with two edges (whose Alexander dual is a vertex) and the result follows from Lemma [\ref=remark_MiRo]. Now, let d  ≥  2. If |VB| = d + 2, take u∉B*. If lk(u,B) is not a simplex, Lemmas [\ref=lema_d+2_is_the_link] and [\ref=lema_formula_central] [\eqref=item_K_tau_es_suspension_de_K] imply B*≃Σtlk(u,B)*, which is contractible by induction since lk(u,B) is a ball. If lk(u,B) is a simplex, the result follows immediately.

Suppose |VB|  ≥  d + 3 and let v∈∂B. Now, B* - v is contractible by Lemma [\ref=lema_link_y_deletion_dual] [\eqref=item_B*-v_contractible] or Lemma [\ref=lema_link_y_deletion_dual] [\eqref=item_B*-v_suspension_of_link*] and induction. Since B* = B* - v + st(v,B*) is acyclic by Alexander duality then B* is contractible by Lemma [\ref=lema_dos_contractiles_y_S1] [\eqref=item_K=A+B_contractible].

Now let S be a combinatorial sphere. We may assume that |VS|  ≥  d + 3. We proceed again by induction on d. Let d  ≥  1 and v∈S. By Lemma [\ref=lema_link_y_deletion_dual] [\eqref=item_la_que_vale_siempre], lk(v,S*) = (S - v)* which is contractible by Newman's theorem and the previous case. Since S* = S* - v + st(v,S*) where [formula] is contractible, then S≃S* - v≃Σtlk(v,S)* by Lemma [\ref=lema_dos_contractiles_y_S1] [\eqref=item_AcapB_y_B_contractible_K=A] and Lemma [\ref=lema_link_y_deletion_dual] [\eqref=item_B*-v_suspension_of_link*]. The result now follows by the inductive hypothesis on the (d - 1)-sphere lk(v,S).

Note that this theorem actually holds for simplicial (not necessarily combinatorial) balls and spheres. The more general formulation follows from this result using an argument of Dong [\cite=Dong], since the non-trivial cases turn out to be polytopal which, in turn, are combinatorial (see also [\cite=ES] [\cite=Mani]).

In order to prove the generalization of Santos and Sturmfels' result, we first need to characterize the d-homogeneous subcomplex of an NH-ball of dimension d and d + 3 vertices. We need the following known result on manifolds with few vertices.

The following is an immediate consequence of this result.

Let B be an NH-ball of dimension d and n  ≤  d + 3 vertices. Then, the d-homogeneous subcomplex Yd  ⊂  B is a combinatorial d-ball.

Since B is acyclic, by Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_nh-pseudo] Yd is a weak d-pseudomanifold with boundary. We may assume d  ≥  2 and |VYd| = d + 3 since the cases d = 0,1 and |VYd| = d + 1 are trivial and, if |VYd| = d + 2, Yd is an elementary starring of a simplex by [\cite=Mani]. Note that Yd is necessarily connected. We first prove that Yd is a combinatorial manifold. Let v∈Yd. By the same reasoning as above we may assume |Vlk(v,B)| = d + 2. If lk(v,B) is an NH-ball then lk(v,Yd) is a combinatorial (d - 1)-ball by inductive hypothesis since lk(v,Yd) is the (d - 1)-homogeneous part of lk(v,B). Suppose lk(v,B) is an NH-sphere. If dim h(lk(v,B)) = d - 1 then lk(v,B) = lk(v,Yd) is a combinatorial (d - 1)-sphere by Proposition [\ref=prop_d=k_implies_homogeneous]. Otherwise, lk(v,Yd) is the (d - 1)-homogeneous part of the NH-ball in any decomposition of lk(v,B) and the result follows again by induction. This shows that Yd is a combinatorial d-manifold.

Suppose d = 2. Note that Yd is [formula]-acyclic since it is connected, it has non-empty boundary and it is contained in the acyclic complex B. On the other hand, any [formula]-acyclic complex with 5 vertices is collapsible (see for example [\cite=BD2]).

For d  ≥  3, Yd is a combinatorial d-ball by Corollary [\ref=kunelcoro].

Any NH-ball B of dimension d  ≥  2 and d + 3 vertices collapses to a complex of dimension d - 2.

We first show that all the principal (d - 1)-simplices in B can be collapsed. Let Yd - 1 be the subcomplex of B generated by the principal (d - 1)-simplices and let Yd be the d-homogeneous part of B. By the previous proposition, Yd is a combinatorial ball. Suppose that not all the (d - 1)-simplices in Yd - 1 can be collapsed. Let K be the subcomplex of Yd - 1 generated by these (d - 1)-simplices. By assumption, [formula]. Note that K is a weak (d - 1)-pseudomanifold with boundary by Theorem [\ref=teo_recuento_nh-variedades] [\eqref=item_nh-pseudo] but it has no free (d - 2)-faces in B. Then ∂K  ⊂  Yd. Therefore, if c denotes the formal sum of the (d - 1)-simplices of K then c∈Hd - 1(B,Yd). Since B and Yd are contractible then Hd - 1(B,Yd) = 0. This implies that c is not a generating cycle, which is a contradiction since the (d - 1)-simplices of c are maximal. This shows that we can collapse all the principal (d - 1)-simplices in B. On the other hand, since Yd is a combinatorial d-ball with d + 3 vertices or less, it is vertex decomposable by [\cite=KK]. In particular Yd is collapsible with no need of further subdivision. Then we can make the collapses in order of decreasing dimension and collapse the d-simplices and the (d - 1)-simplices of Yd afterwards to obtain a (d - 2)-dimensional complex.

We proceed by induction on d. If d = 3 then B is collapsible since it is acyclic and has few vertices (see [\cite=BD2]). Let d  ≥  4 and write B = Δd + st(u,B) where u∉Δd. Now, [formula] is an NH-ball since B is one. Also, dim (lk(u,B))  ≤  d - 1 and |Vlk(u,B)|  ≤  d + 1. Let m = |Vlk(u,B)| -  dim (lk(u,B)). If m = 1 then lk(u,B) is a simplex and [formula]. For m = 2,3,4 we use the inductive hypothesis, Proposition [\ref=propoballd+3tod-2] or Corollary [\ref=coro_existence_of_spines] respectively to show that lk(u,B) collapses to a complex of dimension dim (lk(u,B)) - (5 - m) = |Vlk(u,B)| - m - (5 - m) = |Vlk(u,B)| - 5  ≤  d + 1 - 5 = d - 4. Therefore, [formula] collapses to a complex of dimension d - 3. Finally, if m  ≥  5 then dim (lk(u,B))  ≤  |Vlk(u,B)| - 5  ≤  d - 4 and dim (st(u,B))  ≤  d - 3. In any case we can collapse afterwards the i-simplices of Δd (i = d,d - 1,d - 2) in order of decreasing dimension to obtain a (d - 3)-dimensional complex.

We are ready to prove now the first of our main results.

By Lemma [\ref=lema_formula_central] [\eqref=item_K_tau_es_suspension_de_K] we only need to prove the case [formula]. It suffices to prove that B* is simply connected. Let d =  dim (B) and n = |VB|. We can assume that d  ≥  2 since in lower dimensions all NH-balls are combinatorial. We can also assume that 2  ≤  n - d  ≤  4, since if n - d  ≥  5, a simple argument of Dong [\cite=Dong] shows that B* is simply connected (it contains the complete 2-skeleton of Δ(VB*)).

If n  ≤  7, B* is collapsible since it is acyclic and it has few vertices ([\cite=BD2]). For n  ≥  8, by Proposition [\ref=propoballd+3tod-2] and Corollaries [\ref=coro_existence_of_spines] and [\ref=corocollapsod-3] there exists a subcomplex K  ⊂  B such that [formula] with VK = VB and |VK| -  dim (K) = 5. Therefore [formula], and since |VK| -  dim (K) = 5, K* is simply connected.

Our next goal is to prove the second of our main results.

Like in the proof for NH-balls, we only need to prove the case [formula] and 2  ≤  |VS| -  dim (S)  ≤  4 since, as before, if |VS| -  dim (S)  ≥  5, then S* is simply connected, and a simply connected space with the homology of a sphere is homotopy equivalent to one. We can suppose also that dim h(S) <  dim (S) by Proposition [\ref=prop_d=k_implies_homogeneous] and Theorem [\ref=teo_dong]. The 1-dimensional case is easy to verify.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=teorema_esferas_completo] will be divided in the following four cases. Let d =  dim (S)  ≥  2, n = |VS| and k =  dim h(S). We handle each case separately.

n = d + 2 and k = d - 1.

n = d + 2 and k = d - 2.

n = d + 3 and k = d - 1.

Remaining cases.

We will show that [formula] with |VK| -  dim (K) = 5. The result will follow immediately from Lemma [\ref=remark_MiRo] and the fact that K* is simply connected. The case n = d + 4 follows directly from Corollary [\ref=coro_existence_of_spines] by collapsing (only) the d-simplices of S.

Suppose now that n = d + 2 or d + 3 and let S = B + L be a decomposition. We first analyze the case n = 5. In this situation, [formula]. If d = 2 then B is acyclic with four vertices and if d = 3 then B = Δ3. Similarly as in the 1-dimensional case, [formula] and the result follows from Lemma [\ref=remark_MiRo].

Suppose n = d + 3 with n  ≥  6. The complex B in the decomposition of S is an NH-ball of dimension d and |VB|∈{d + 1,d + 2,d + 3}. In any case, B collapses to a (d - 2)-dimensional complex T whether because B = Δd or by Corollary [\ref=corocollapsod-3] or Proposition [\ref=propoballd+3tod-2]. Moreover, since d  ≥  3, we can arrange the collapses in order of decreasing dimension to get VT = VB by collapsing only the d and (d - 1)-dimensional simplices. Since dim (L)  ≤  d - 2 and it is top generated, the collapses in [formula] can be carried out in S and therefore [formula], which is a complex with the desired properties.

The case n = d + 2 with n  ≥  6 follows similarly as the previous case by showing that S collapses to a (d - 3)-dimensional complex with the same vertices.

We proceed by induction. Write [formula] with u∉Δd. Note that lk(u,S) is an NH-sphere of homotopy dimension d - 2 and dimension d - 2 or d - 1. By Lemmas [\ref=lema_d+2_is_the_link] and [\ref=lema_formula_central] [\eqref=item_K_tau_es_suspension_de_K] it suffices to show that lk(u,S)* is homotopy equivalent to a sphere. If dim (lk(u,S)) = d - 2 then lk(u,S) is homogeneous by Proposition [\ref=prop_d=k_implies_homogeneous] and the result follows from Theorem [\ref=teo_dong]. If dim (lk(u,S)) = d - 1 then |Vlk(u,S)| = d + 1 and the result follows by the inductive hypothesis.

In order to prove the cases [\eqref=(B)] and [\eqref=(C)] we need some preliminary results.

If [formula] then L - v deformation retracts to ∂L  ⊂  B and, hence, [formula]. Otherwise, [formula] and S - v = (B - v) + (L - v) with [formula]. Since [formula], then B - v and L - v are contractible. On the other hand, ∂L - v is contractible by Newman's theorem. Hence, S - v is contractible.

We proceed by induction in d. The case d = 1 is straightforward. Let d  ≥  2. We prove first that S - v is an NH-manifold.

Let w∈S - v. We have to show that its link is an NH-sphere or an NH-ball. If w∉st(v,S) then lk(w,S - v) = lk(w,S) which is an NH-ball or NH-sphere. Suppose w∈st(v,S). We will show first that lk(w,S) is an NH-sphere of homotopy dimension d - 2. We prove this in various steps. Note that this is clear if w∈L, so we may suppose w∉L.

Step 1. We first prove that if v∉L then there is a d-simplex in st(w,S) which is adjacent to a (d - 1)-simplex of L. Write Δd  =  {v,w}c. Since v,w∉L then L  ⊂  Δd and therefore Δd∉S because L is top generated in S. Since dim (S) = d and st(v,S) is (d - 1)-homogeneous then w is a face of d-simplex ρ not containing v. Since any two (d - 1)-faces of Δd are adjacent then ρ is adjacent to some (d - 1)-simplex of L.

Step 2. We now prove that the inclusion induces an isomorphism Hd - 1(S - w)≃Hd - 1(B - w). On one hand, the induced homomorphism Hd - 1(B - w)  →  Hd - 1(S - w) is injective since (S - w) - (B - w) = L - w is (d - 1)-dimensional. To prove that it is also surjective we show that any (d - 1)-cycle in S - w cannot contain a (d - 1)-simplex of L. Suppose σ∈L is a non-trivial factor in a (d - 1)-cycle cd - 1 of S - w. Then every (d - 1)-simplex in L appears in cd - 1 since cd - 1 is a cycle and L is a top generated combinatorial (d - 1)-ball. If v∈L then every (d - 1)-simplex of st(v,S) appears in cd - 1 since st(v,S) is also a top generated (d - 1)-ball. In this case, at least one (d - 1)-simplex of st(v,S) belongs to st(w,S), contradicting the fact that cd - 1 is a cycle in S - w. On the other hand, if v∉L then there exists by step 1 a principal (d - 1)-simplex τ∈L with a boundary (d - 2)-face η  <  ρ∈st(w,S) with dim (ρ) = d. Let z = lk(η,τ). Note that there are no d-simplices outside st(w,S) containing η since neither v, w nor z may belong to such d-simplex and |VS| = d + 3. Since S is an NH-manifold, τ is the only principal (d - 1)-simplex containing η, and then ∂cd - 1  ≠  0 in S - w, which is a contradiction.

Step 3. We prove that lk(w,S) is an NH-sphere of homotopy dimension d - 2. We claim first that Hd - 1(S - w) = 0. By step 2 it suffices to show that Hd - 1(B - w) = 0. From the Mayer-Vietoris sequence applied to B = B - w + st(w,S) and the fact that lk(w,B) = lk(w,S) (here we use that w∉L), it follows that Hd - 1(B - w)≃Hd - 1(lk(w,S)). If Hd - 1(lk(w,S))  ≠  0 then lk(w,S) is (d - 1)-homogeneous by Proposition [\ref=prop_d=k_implies_homogeneous], which is a contradiction since st(w,S) contains at least a (d - 1)-simplex. Thus, the claim is proved.

If we now consider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for S = S - w + st(w,S) in degree d - 1 one has that [formula] is injective, so Hd - 2(lk(w,S))  ≠  0 and therefore lk(w,S) is an NH-sphere of homotopy dimension d - 2.

Finally if dim (lk(w,S)) = d - 2 then lk(w,S) is a combinatorial (d - 2)-sphere by Proposition [\ref=prop_d=k_implies_homogeneous] and therefore, lk(w,S - v) = lk(w,S) - v is a combinatorial (d - 2)-ball by Newman's theorem. Suppose that dim (lk(w,S)) = d - 1. If |Vlk(w,S)| = d + 1 then we may write lk(w,S) = Δd - 1 + st(v,lk(w,S)) since v is not a vertex of a d-simplex in S. In this case lk(w,S) - v = Δd - 1. If |Vlk(w,S)| = d + 2 we may apply the inductive hypothesis since lk(v,lk(w,S)) = lk(w,lk(v,S)) is a combinatorial (d - 3)-sphere, and conclude that lk(w,S) - v is an NH-ball. This proves that S - v is an NH-manifold.

We prove now that S - v is an NH-ball. Note that dim (S - v) = d and |VS - v| = d + 2, so by Proposition [\ref=propo_d+2_nh_manifolds] we only need to prove that it is acyclic, and this follows immediately from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence applied to S = S - v + st(v,S).

We prove [\eqref=(B)] and [\eqref=(C)] together by induction in d. Let S = B + L be a decomposition.

If d = 2, B is collapsible since it is acyclic and has few vertices. Then [formula] for [\eqref=(B)] and [formula] for [\eqref=(C)]. The results then follow in both cases from Lemma [\ref=remark_MiRo].

Let d  ≥  3. Suppose first that S satisfies the hypotheses of [\eqref=(B)]. Write [formula]. Then S* = lk(v,S)τ for τ  =  Δ(VS - Vst(v,S)) by Lemma [\ref=lema_d+2_is_the_link]. Since lk(v,S) is an NH-sphere of dimension ≤  d - 1 then the result follows from Theorem [\ref=teo_dong], cases [\eqref=(A)] and [\eqref=(D)] or the inductive hypothesis on [\eqref=(B)] and [\eqref=(C)].

Finally suppose S satisfies the hypotheses of [\eqref=(C)]. By Lemma [\ref=prop_(S-v)*_contractil] there exists v∈VL such that [formula]. Write S* = S* - v + st(v,S*) where [formula]. By Lemmas [\ref=lema_dos_contractiles_y_S1] [\eqref=item_AcapB_y_B_contractible_K=A] and [\ref=lema_link_y_deletion_dual] [\eqref=item_B*-v_suspension_of_link*], S*≃S* - v≃Σtlk(v,S)* (note that v is not isolated nor lk(v,S) is a simplex because v∈L). Since lk(v,S) is an NH-sphere of dimension ≤  d - 1 then lk(v,S)* is homotopy equivalent to a sphere by Theorem [\ref=teo_dong], cases [\eqref=(A)] and [\eqref=(D)] or inductive hypothesis on [\eqref=(B)] and [\eqref=(C)].
