Search for the Higgs Boson decaying into tau pairs

SEARCH FOR THE HIGGS BOSON DECAYING INTO TAU PAIRS

Introduction

We present a search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson decaying into tau-pairs in the invariant mass region 110-145 2 performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb- 1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.4 fb- 1 at 8 TeV . Since July 4th 2012 an experimental observation of a new Boson of a mass around 125 2 and compatible with the Standard Model Higgs Boson hypothesis is established both by the Atlas and CMS collaborations Ref. ,  ,  . The observation of the Higgs-like Boson is predominantly based on its couplings to gauge bosons. To seek direct evidence for its fermionic couplings, the search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson decaying into tau-pairs is a distinguished channel to be analyzed with the CMS detector.

Analysis Strategy

The search is simultaneously performed in several final states of the decaying di-tau system, henceforth denoted as: τhτh, eτh, μτh, eμ and μμ, where τh declares the hadronically decaying tau final states. For each final state the events are then divided into several disjoint event categories in order to enhance the overall sensetivity by exploiting the distinct event topologies of the Higgs production processes. Major Higgs production mechanisms considered are processes via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion and the vector boson associated production. The dedicated H  →  ττ analyses exploiting the associated Higgs productions (see Ref. ) are not discussed in detail in this review, however are included in the results in figure  [\ref=f1] and  [\ref=f3].

The most sensitive category is the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) category where the event topology of Standard Model Higgs production via Vector Boson Fusion is exploited which is characterized by two high pT jets in the forward regions of the detector. In addition to the event and lepton selection criteria events in the VBF category are required to have two jets with pT > 30 and |η| > 4.7, having an invariant mass of mjj > 5002, with a seperation in the pseudo-rapdity Δηjj  >  3.5 and no addtional jet with pT > 30 in the eta gap between the two corresponding jets.

In addition a 1-Jet category is defined. Events with at least one jet with pT > 30 and |η| > 4.7 are selected in this category, exluding events of the VBF category. The Standard Model Higgs production via gluon fusion dominates the signal contribution in the 1-Jet category.

Further the 0-Jet category is defined for events with no jet with pT > 30 and |η| > 4.7. This category is largely dominated by background processes and is used to constrain the backgrounds in the VBF and 1-Jet categories.

For all categories a b-tagged jet with pT > 20 veto is applied to decouple the analysis from the MSSM Higgs search in the di-tau channel.

The background compositions are channel and category dependent with the [formula] processes representing typically the most dominant contributions over t, W+Jets, [formula], QCD multijet-events and di-boson productions. To further reduce the various backgrounds additional topological event selection criteria depend on the final state are defined.

For the eμ final state the t background is significantly reduced with selection criteria on Dζ  =  pζ  -  0.85  ·  pvisζ  >   - 20, where ζ is the bisector of the two leptons, [formula] and [formula]. Dζ is a measure of how collinear the missing transverse energy vector is with the ransverse momentum of the di-lepton system (see figure [\ref=f2] (left)).

For the eτh and μτh final states the W+Jets background is reduced by selection criteria on the transverse mass variable [formula] (see figure [\ref=f2] (middle)).

For the μμ final state the overwhelming [formula] background is reduced by selection criteria on dedicated multivariate Boosted Decision Trees in each category. (see figure [\ref=f2] (right)).

Results

The observed and expected 95% CL exclusion limit on the Standard Model Higgs Boson production rate is derived by a combined fit on the reconstructed di-tau mass mττ in each category for each channel and shown in figure [\ref=f3] (right). For the μμ final state the 2 dimensional distribution of mττ versus the invariant mass of the two muons is used. Figure [\ref=f3] (left) shows the combined mττ distribution obtained after summing up the mττ distribution of each category of the τhτh, eτh, μτh and eμ final states weighted by the ratio of the expected signal and background yields.

An excess of the observed limit when compared to the background-only hypothesis is found and the local p-value and signifiacance of this excess as a function of the Higgs mass is shown in figure [\ref=f1] (left). A maximum significance of 2.93 standard deviations is observed for a Higgs mass of mH = 1202 and a significance of 2.85σ at mH = 1252 compared to the Standard Model expectation of 2.63σ. The signal strength for mH is measured to be 1.1  ±  0.4 times the Standard Model Higgs production rate (see figure [\ref=f1] (right))and thus the excess is compatible with the hypothesis of the presence of the Standard Model Higgs Boson.
