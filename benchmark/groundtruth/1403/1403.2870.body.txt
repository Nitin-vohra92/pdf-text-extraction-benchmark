REVIEW OF DOUBLE BETA DECAY EXPERIMENTS

Introduction

Interest in 0νββ decay has seen a significant renewal in recent 10 years after evidence for neutrino oscillations was obtained from the results of atmospheric, solar, reactor, and accelerator neutrino experiments. These results are impressive proof that neutrinos have a nonzero mass. The detection and study of 0νββ decay may clarify the following problems of neutrino physics: (i) lepton number non-conservation, (ii) neutrino nature: whether the neutrino is a Dirac or a Majorana particle, (iii) absolute neutrino mass scale (a measurement or a limit on m1), (iv) the type of neutrino mass hierarchy (normal, inverted, or quasidegenerate), (v) CP violation in the lepton sector (measurement of the Majorana CP-violating phases).

Present status

Two neutrino double beta decay

The 2νββ decay ((A,Z)  →  (A,Z + 2)  +  2e-  +  2) is a second-order process, which is not forbidden by any conservation law. The detection of this process provides the experimental determination of the nuclear matrix elements (NME) involved in the ββ-decay processes. This leads to the development of theoretical schemes for NME calculations both in connection with the 2νββ decays as well as the 0νββ decays. Table 1 displays the present-day averaged and recommended values of T1 / 2(2ν) from [\cite=BAR13]

Neutrinoless double beta decay

The 0νββ decay ((A,Z)  →  (A,Z + 2)  +  2e-) violates the law of lepton-number conservation (ΔL = 2) and requires that the Majorana neutrino has a nonzero rest mass or that an admixture of right-handed currents be present in weak interaction. Also, this process is possible in some supersymmetric models, where 0νββ decay is initiated by the exchange of supersymmetric particles. This decay also arises in models featuring an extended Higgs sector within electroweak-interaction theory and in some other cases (see review [\cite=VER12], for example). The best present limits on 0νββ decay are presented in Table 2. In calculating constraints on 〈mν〉, the NMEs from [\cite=SUH12] [\cite=SIM13] [\cite=BAR09] [\cite=RAT10] [\cite=ROD10] [\cite=MEN09], phase-space factors from [\cite=KOT12] and gA = 1.27 were used. Present conservative limit on 〈mν〉 can be set as 0.34 eV.

Neutrinoless double beta decay with Majoron emission

The 0νχ0ββ decay((A,Z)  →  (A,Z + 2)  +  2e-  +  χ0) requires the existence of a Majoron. It is a massless Goldstone boson that arises due to a global breakdown of (B-L) symmetry, where B and L are, respectively, the baryon and the lepton number. The Majoron, if it exists, could playa significant role in the history of the early Universe and in the evolution of stars. The best obtained limits on 0νχ0ββ decay are presented in Table 3 . Present conservative limit can be set as 〈gee〉  <  10- 5.

Current large-scale experiments

EXO-200

EXO-200 (Enriched Xenon Observatory) is operating at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP, 1585 m w.e.) since May 2011. The experiment consists of 175 kg of Xe enriched to 80.6% in 136Xe housed in a liquid time projection chamber (TPC). Both ionization and scintillation are used to measure the energy with a resolution of 3.9 % (FWHM) at 2,615 MeV. The detector is capable of effectively rejecting rays through topological cuts. Results obtained after ~   3000 h of measurements are the following [\cite=AUG12] [\cite=ALB14]:

T1 / 2 (2ν, 136Xe) = [formula] (4)

T1 / 2 (0ν, 136Xe) [formula] (5)

With the present background, the predicted EXO-200 sensitivity after 5 years of data taking will be [formula] yr (〈mν〉 ~   0.10-0.24 eV).

KamLAND-Zen

The detector KamLAND-Zen is a modification of the existing KamLAND detector carried out in the summer of 2011. The ββ source/detector is 13 tons of Xe-loaded liquid scintillator (Xe-LS) contained in a 3.08 m diameter spherical Inner Balloon (IB). The IB is suspended at the center of the KamLAND detector. The outer LS acts as an active shield for external γ-rays and as a detector for internal radiation from the Xe-LS or IB. The Xe-LS contains (2.52 ±   0.07) % by weight of enriched xenon gas (full weight of xenon is ~   330 kg). The isotopic abundances in the enriched xenon is (90.93 ±   0.05) % of 136Xe. Main obtained results are the following [\cite=GAN12] [\cite=GAN13]:

T1 / 2 (2ν, 136Xe) = [formula] (6)

T1 / 2 (0ν, 136Xe) [formula] (7)

T1 / 2 (0νχ0, 136Xe) [formula] (8)

Now the Collaboration undertakes efforts to understand and decrease the background. In principle, it could be lowered by factor ~   100 (in this case sensitivity will be improved by factor ~   10).

GERDA-I

GERDA is a low-background experiment which searches for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge, using an array of high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors isotopically enriched in 76Ge [\cite=ACK13]. The detectors are operated naked in ultra radio-pure liquid argon, which acts as the cooling medium and as a passive shielding against the external radiation. The experiment is located in the underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of the INFN (Italy, 3500 m w.e.). The Phase I of GERDA use eight enriched coaxial detectors refurbished from Heidelberg-Moscow and IGEX experiments (corresponding to approximately 18 kg of 76Ge). The energy resolution is ≈   4.5 KeV at 2.039 MeV. GERDA-I measurements have been started in November 2011 and stoped in May of 2013. Results of the measurement are [\cite=AGO13] [\cite=AGO13b]:

T1 / 2 (2ν, 76Ge) = [formula] (9)

T1 / 2 (0ν, 76Ge) [formula] (10)

In 2014 new ~   20 kg of HPGe crystals will be added and experiment will be transformed to Phase II (GERDA-II).

Future large-scale experiments

Seven of the most developed and promising experiments which can be realized within the next few years are presented in Table 4. The estimation of the sensitivity to 〈mν〉 is made using NMEs from [\cite=SUH12] [\cite=SIM13] [\cite=BAR09] [\cite=RAT10] [\cite=ROD10] [\cite=MEN09] and phase-space factor values from [\cite=KOT12].
