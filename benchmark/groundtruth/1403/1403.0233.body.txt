Combinatorics of Dumont differential system on the Jacobi elliptic functions

Introduction

Let sn  (u,k),cn  (u,k) and dn  (u,k) be three basic Jacobi elliptic functions. These functions occur naturally in geometry, analysis, number theory, algebra and combinatorics (see [\cite=Conrad02] [\cite=Dumont81] [\cite=Milne96] [\cite=Myung98]). Finding the connection between Jacobi elliptic functions and combinatorics has been a hot research topic in mathematics for more than forties years (see, e.g., [\cite=Dumont79] [\cite=Dumont81] [\cite=Flajolet89] [\cite=Myung98] [\cite=Viennot80] and references therein). As pointed out by Flajolet and Franon [\cite=Flajolet89], the question of possible combinatorial significance of the coefficients appearing in the Maclaurin expansions of the Jacobi elliptic functions has first been raised by Schützenberger. This paper presents several answers related to Dumont's [\cite=Dumont81] work. In particular, in Section [\ref=Section-4], we show that the statistics of permutations, such as the longest alternating subsequences and alternating runs are both closely related to these functions. It should be noted that the study of the distribution of the length of the longest alternating subsequences of permutations was recently initiated by Stanley [\cite=Sta07] [\cite=Sta08] [\cite=Sta10].

The function sn  (u,k) is defined as the inverse of the elliptic integral

[formula]

where k is known as the modulus and satisfies 0 < k < 1 (see [\cite=Jacobi1829]). Hence x = sn  (u,k). The functions cn  (u,k) and dn  (u,k) are given as follows:

[formula]

Moreover, Jacobi elliptic functions can also be defined in terms of Jacobi theta functions (see [\cite=Gudermann1839] [\cite=Liu07]). Using formal methods, Abel [\cite=Abel1826] discovered that these functions satisfy the following system of differential equations:

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the symmetric group of all permutations of

[formula]

s=|{π∈: X(π)=i, Y(π)=j}|.

[formula]

Preliminaries

Recall that F(x,k) is defined in [\eqref=ellipticintegral]. We define For any sequence an,i,j, we define the following generating functions

[formula]

where we use the small letters [formula] for sequences, capital letters [formula] for generating functions, and [formula] for the even and odd parts of the generating functions, respectively. We denote by Hy the partial derivative of the function H with respect to y.

From [\eqref=Dumont-recu], we get the following comparable result of [\eqref=Dumont-explicit].

We have

[formula]

where [formula] and 0 < q < 1.

By [\eqref=Dumont-recu], we have

[formula]

Equivalently, [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Solving ([\ref=Dumont-J-pair]) for SO'x - SE'x and SO'x + SE'x (with the help of maple), we obtain that there exist two (analytical) functions K1 and K2 such that

[formula]

In order to provide explicit formulas for the generating functions SO'x and SE'x, we first solve ([\ref=Dumont-J-pair]) for q = 0. In this case, we obtain

[formula]

Note that the initial conditions are

[formula]

Thus it is easy to see that the solution of this system of PDEs is

[formula]

with I is the imaginary unit. Therefore, when q = 0, ([\ref=eqss1]) gives

[formula]

which leads to K2(p,x) =  - K1(p,x) = K(p,x). Hence, by ([\ref=eqss1]) we get ([\ref=eqss0]), as desired.

In order to provide a unified approach to the sequences discussed in this paper, we introduce the following definitions.

A pair (F,G) = (F(x,p,q),G(x,p,q)) of functions is called a J-pair of the first type if they satisfy the following system of PDEs:

[formula]

By defining

[formula]

we have

[formula]

It is not hard to check that the solution (with [formula] and [formula]) of these PDEs is given by

[formula]

for any two functions V and [formula].

A pair [formula] of functions is called a J-pair of the second type if they satisfy the following system of PDEs:

[formula]

We shall give a remark on the solution of [\eqref=eqJpair-2]. By defining

[formula]

we have

[formula]

It is not hard to check that the solution (with [formula] and [formula]) of these PDEs is given by

[formula]

for any two functions W and [formula].

Solutions of several systems of PDEs

J-pair of the first type

There are countless combinatorial structures related to the differential operators xD and Dx; see, e.g., [\cite=Flajolet09] [\cite=Joyal81] [\cite=Ma13]. It is natural to further study [\eqref=diff-elliptic] via these differential operators. Assume that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In particular, from [\eqref=diff-elliptic], we have For n  ≥  0, we define

[formula]

For convenience, we list the first terms of the corresponding generating functions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

The recurrences [\eqref=a-recu-1] and [\eqref=a-recu-2] can be written as the following lemma.

We have

[formula]

Equivalently, (AO',AE') is a J-pair of the first type, where [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula]. Define

[formula]

Then

[formula]

By Remark [\ref=GenJP] and Lemma [\ref=lem:aa1], we obtain that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some functions V and ṽ. Moreover, at q = 0, then above equations reduce to

[formula]

Hence, if we guess that AE(x,p,0) = G(x,p) and AO(x,p,0) = H(x,p), then we get

[formula]

which imply

[formula]

It is routine to check that the functions AO and AE satisfy Lemma [\ref=lem:aa1]. This completes the proof.

Along the same lines, we get

[formula]

This leads us to the following result.

We have

[formula]

Equivalently, (CO',CE') is a J-pair of the first type, where [formula] and [formula].

Define [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

By Remark [\ref=GenJP] and Lemma [\ref=lem:cc1], we obtain that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some functions V and ṽ. Moreover, at q = 0, then above equations reduce to

[formula]

Hence, if we take

[formula]

then [\eqref=eq:solcc] is a solution for [\eqref=c-PDE], where

[formula]

To complete the proof, we need to check that the functions CO and CE satisfy Lemma [\ref=lem:cc1], which is routine.

We have

[formula]

By applying Theorem [\ref=thCCth] for q = 0 or p = 1, we obtain the formulas of C(x,p,0) and C(x,1,q). Solving [\eqref=c-PDE] for p = 0 we obtain

[formula]

By using the initial conditions CE(0,p,q) = 1 and CO(0,p,q) = 0, we obtain [formula] and [formula], which completes the first part of the proof.

Again, solving [\eqref=c-PDE] with q = 1 for CO(x,p,1) - CE(x,p,1) and CO(x,p,1) + CE(x,p,1), we obtain

[formula]

where V,ṽ are two fixed functions. By the initial values CE(0,p,q) = 1 and CO(0,p,q) = 0, we get

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Along the same lines, we get

[formula]

which leads to the following result.

We have

[formula]

Equivalently, (DO',DE') is a J-pair of the first type, where [formula] and [formula].

By similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thCCth] with help of Remark [\ref=GenJP] and Lemma [\ref=lem:dd1], we obtain the following result.

Define [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

From Corollary [\ref=CO:caseC] and Corollary [\ref=CO:caseD], it is easy to verify that

[formula]

J-pair of the second type

In his study [\cite=Chen93] of exponential structures in combinatorics, Chen introduced the grammatical method systematically. Let A be an alphabet whose letters are regarded as independent commutative indeterminates. Following Chen, a context-free grammar G over A is defined as a set of substitution rules that replace a letter in A by a formal function over A. The formal derivative D is a linear operator defined with respect to a context-free grammar G. Therefore, an equivalent form of [\eqref=diff-elliptic] is given by the context-free grammar

[formula]

Dumont [\cite=Dumont96] considered chains of general substitution rules on words. In particular, he discovered the following result.

If

[formula]

then where [formula] is the Eulerian number, i.e., the number of permutations in [formula] with k descents.

As a conjunction of [\eqref=grammar-Schett] and [\eqref=grammar-Dumont], it is natural to consider the context-free grammar

[formula]

From [\eqref=Extension-grammar-Schett], we have

For n  ≥  0, we define

[formula]

The first terms of the corresponding generating functions are given as follows:

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

By rewriting these recurrence relations in terms of the generating functions TE and TO, we obtain the following result.

We have

[formula]

Equivalently, (TO',TE') is a J-pair of the second type, where [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

By Remark [\ref=GenJP-2], we see that Lemma [\ref=lem:tt1] leads to

[formula]

for some functions W and W̃. Thus, at q = 0 we have that

[formula]

Therefore, if we set

[formula]

then

[formula]

By [\eqref=eqtt11], we have

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

which agrees with the case q = 0. It suffices and is routine to check that the functions TO and TE satisfy Lemma [\ref=lem:tt1]. This completes the proof.

By the above theorem (or by a direct check using Lemma [\ref=lem:tt1]), we realize the following result.

Let [formula]. Then, we have

[formula]

Along the same lines, we have

[formula]

which implies the following result.

We have

[formula]

Equivalently, (RO',RE') is a J-pair of the second type, where

[formula]

Along the line of the proof of Theorem [\ref=th_TT] we state the following result.

Let

[formula]

where [formula]. Then

[formula]

By Remark [\ref=GenJP-2], we obtain

[formula]

for some functions W and W̃. Thus, at q = 0 we have that

[formula]

Therefore, if we set

[formula]

then

[formula]

where [formula]. By [\eqref=eqrr11], we deduce that

[formula]

which agrees with the case q = 0. To complete the proof, we still need to check that the functions RO and RE satisfy Lemma [\ref=lem:rr1], which is routine.

Applications

In this section we apply the results obtained in the previous section to present new characterizations for several combinatorial structures.

Peaks, descents and perfect matchings

One of the most interesting permutation statistics is the peaks statistic (see, e.g., [\cite=Aguiar04] [\cite=Dilks09] [\cite=Ma121] [\cite=Ma122] [\cite=Ma1303] [\cite=Petersen07] [\cite=Stembridge97] and the references contained therein). A left peak in π is an index i∈[n  -  1] such that π(i - 1) < π(i) > π(i + 1), where we take π(0) = 0. Denote by [formula] the number of permutations in [formula] with k left peaks. Recall that Pn,k is the number of permutations in [formula] with k interior peaks. Define

[formula]

The polynomial Pn(x) satisfies recurrence relation with the initial values P1(x) = 1, P2(x) = 2, P3(x) = 4 + 2x, and the polynomial [formula] satisfies recurrence relation

[formula]

with the initial values [formula] (see [\cite=Sloane]).

A descent of a permutation [formula] is a position i such that π(i) > π(i + 1). Denote by des  (π) the number of descents of π. Let The polynomial An(x) is called an Eulerian polynomial. Let Bn denote the set of signed permutations of ±  [n] such that π( - i) =  - π(i) for all i, where [formula]. Let

[formula]

where des  B = |{i∈[n]:ω(i - 1) > ω(i)}| with π(0) = 0. The polynomial Bn(x) is said to be the Eulerian polynomial of type B, while B(n,k) is called an Eulerian number of type B.

It is well known that Eulerian polynomials are closely retated to peak statistics. In particular, Stembridge [\cite=Stembridge97] showed that In [\cite=Petersen06], Petersen observed that It should be noted that

Recall that a perfect matching of

[formula]

into n blocks of size 2. Denote by N(n,k) the number of perfect matchings of

[formula]

N(x)=(2n+1)xN(x)+2x(1-x)N(x),

[formula]

A(x,1,1)===.

[formula]

A(x,p,1)=A(x,p,1)+2p(1-p)A(x,p,1)+2xpA(x,1,1).

[formula]

f=(2i+1)f+(n-2i+1)f,  0≤ i≤ ⌊ n/2⌋,

[formula]

ax=(x),

[formula]

(xD)(y)=xD(xD)(y)=xD((xD)(y)).

[formula]

(xD)(y)=xz,  (xD)(y)=2xyz+xy.

[formula]

Alternating runs and the longest alternating subsequences

Let [formula]. We say that π changes direction at position i if either π(i  -  1) < π(i) > π(i + 1), or π(i - 1) > π(i) < π(i + 1), where [formula]. We say that π has k alternating runs if there are k - 1 indices i such that π changes direction at these positions [\cite=Sloane]. Let R(n,k) denote the number of permutations in [formula] with k alternating runs. In recent years, Deutsch and Gessel [\cite=Sloane], Stanley [\cite=Sta08] also studied the generating function for these numbers. As pointed out by Canfield and Wilf [\cite=CW08], the generating function for the numbers R(n,k) can be elusive. Let [formula]. The polynomial Rn(x) is closely related to Pn(x): for n  ≥  2, which was established in [\cite=Ma1303].

An alternating subsequence of π is a subsequence [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Denote by as  (π) the length of the longest alternating subsequence of π. There is a large literature devoted to as  (π) (see [\cite=Arlotto11] [\cite=Sta10] [\cite=Widom06]). Define

[formula]

It should be noted that ak(n) is also the number of permutations in [formula] with k up-down runs. The up-down runs of a permutation π are the alternating runs of π endowed with a 0 in the front (see [\cite=Sloane]). For example, the permutation π = 514632 has 3 alternating runs and 4 up-down runs.

In the same way as the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm:01], it is a routine exercise to show the following.

For n  ≥  1, we have

[formula].

[formula].

[formula].

[formula].

Recall that a permutation π is alternating if

[formula]

In other words, π(i) < π(i  +  1) if i is even and π(i) > π(i  +  1) if i is odd. Let En denote the number of alternating permutations in [formula]. For instance, E4 = 5, corresponding to the permutations 2143, 3142, 3241, 4132 and 4231. Similarly, define π to be reverse alternating if [formula]. The bijection π  ↦  πc on [formula] defined by πc(i) = n + 1 - π(i) shows that En is also the number of reverse alternating permutations in [formula]. The number En is called an Euler number (see [\cite=Sta10]). By definition, we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=t-recu-1], [\eqref=t-recu-2] and [\eqref=rn-recu], it is easy to verify that t2n,0,0 = r2n,0,0 = 0,t2n - 1,0,0 = 1,r2n - 1,0,0 = 2 and for 1  ≤  j  ≤  2n - 1, we have

Therefore, from Theorem [\ref=mainthm:02], we see that the numbers t2n,0,j and r2n,0,j construct a symmetric array with row sums equaling the Euler numbers, as demonstrated in the following array:

[formula]

For convenience, we list the tables of the values of tn,i,j and rn,i,j for 1  ≤  n  ≤  4.

Define Note that

[formula]

Dumont [\cite=Dumont79] found that s2n,i,0 = J2n,2i and s2n + 1,i,0 = J2n + 2,2i. By comparing [\eqref=Dumont-recu] with [\eqref=t-recu-1] and [\eqref=t-recu-2], we get the following result immediately.

For n  ≥  1, we have [formula].

It follows from Leibniz's formula that and similarly,

Therefore, combining [\eqref=Schett-Dumontsystem], we get

Therefore, as a corollary of Theorem [\ref=Jacobi-tnij], we get the following.

For n  ≥  0, we have

We end our paper by giving the following.

Let sn,i,j be the numbers defined by [\eqref=Schett-Dumontsystem]. Set [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

where X(π) (resp., Y(π)) is the number of odd (resp., even) cycle peaks of π. Then
