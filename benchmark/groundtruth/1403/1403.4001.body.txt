Static potentials on asymptotically flat manifolds

Static potentials on asymptotically flat manifolds

introduction

In [\cite=Corvino], Corvino studied localized scalar curvature deformation of a Riemannian metric and introduced the following definition:

A Riemannian metric g is called static on a manifold M if the linearized scalar curvature map at g has a nontrivial cokernel, i.e. if there exists a nontrivial function f on M such that

[formula]

Here [formula], Δ and [formula] denote the Hessian, the Laplacian and the Ricci curvature of g respectively.

We call a nontrivial solution f to [\eqref=eq-static-c] a static potential if it exists. In [\cite=Corvino], Corvino proved that if (M,g) does not have a static potential, one can deform the scalar curvature of g through variations having compact support in M.

It is known that a static metric (as defined above) must have constant scalar curvature (cf. [\cite=Corvino]). When this constant is zero (which is always the case for an asymptotically flat, static metric), [\eqref=eq-static-c] becomes

[formula]

It is this equation that explains the implications of Corvino's result in mathematical relativity, where a vacuum static spacetime is a 4-dimensional Lorentz manifold that is isometric to [formula], where (M,g) is a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold, N  >  0 is a function on M, and the pair (g,N) satisfies

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq-static-f-s] and [\eqref=eq-static-N], one knows if f is a static potential on a manifold (M,g) of zero scalar curvature, then [formula] is a vacuum static spacetime, where [formula].

There exists a vast amount of literature concerning 3-dimensional asymptotically flat manifolds which admit a positive solution N to [\eqref=eq-static-N] in the asymptotic region (see e.g. [\cite=Bunting-Masood] [\cite=Chrusciel98] [\cite=Anderson] [\cite=Miao05] [\cite=Beig-Schoen] [\cite=C-G10] [\cite=M-M13]). Since the positivity of N is always assumed in these works, it is natural to ask:

We recall the definition of an asymptotically flat 3-manifold.

A Riemannian 3-manifold (M,g) (perhaps with boundary) is said to be asymptotically flat if there exists a compact set K such that [formula] consists of a finite number of components E1, [formula], Ek, called the ends of (M,g), such that each end Ei is diffeomorphic to [formula] minus a ball and, under this diffeomorphism, the metric g on Ei satisfies

[formula]

for some constant [formula]. Here x = (x1,x2,x3) denotes the standard coordinate on [formula] and a function φ satisfies φ  =  Ol(|x|-  τ) provided |∂iφ|  ≤  C|x|-  τ  -  i for 0  ≤  i  ≤  l and some constant C.

We first describe a necessary condition for f to be positive near infinity. On an end E of an asymptotically flat (M,g), suppose f is a static potential and f > 0 near infinity, it is known (cf. [\cite=Beig-1980] [\cite=Bunting-Masood]) that there exists a coordinate chart {x1,x2,x3} on E near infinity in which the metric g satisfies

[formula]

where |pij| = O2(|x|- 2) and m is a constant that equals the ADM mass ([\cite=ADM61]) of (M,g) at the end E. Metrics satisfying the fall-off condition given in [\eqref=eq-AS-def-intro] is often called asymptotically Schwarzchild (AS).

Our main result in answering Question [\ref=ques-main] is that the AS condition is also a sufficient condition for the zero set f- 1(0) to be bounded, provided the mass is nonzero.

Let (M,g) be an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with or without boundary. If g is asymptotically Schwarzschild on an end E which has nonzero mass, then any static potential f on E must be bounded and is either positive or negative outside a compact set.

The main tool in our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main-AS] is Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset], which describes the asymptotic behavior of the zero set of f assuming it is unbounded. We also make use of an observation in Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iii) that the Ricci curvature of g, when restricted to the zero set of f, is a multiple of the induced metric.

In relation to the question of its positivity, we also ask "how many" static potentials may exist. We prove

Let (M,g) be a connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold with or without boundary. Let F be the space of all solutions to [\eqref=eq-static-f-s]. Let dim (F) be the dimension of F. Then  dim (F)  ≤  1 unless (M,g) is flat.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main-dimension], beside Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset], we also use a local result that describes the dimension of F on any open set. We prove the following result using some techniques by Tod [\cite=Tod-2000].

Let (M,g) be a connected, 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold of zero scalar curvature. Let F be the space of static potentials on (M,g). Then

dim (F)  ≤  2 unless (M,g) is flat.

If there exist two linearly independent functions f1,f2∈F such that [formula], then (M,g) is flat.

Our method in proving Theorem [\ref=thm-main-AS] and Theorem [\ref=thm-main-dimension] also allow us to obtain some rigidity results for complete, asymptotically flat manifolds without boundary which admit a static potential. For instance, a direct corollary of Theorem [\ref=thm-main-AS], Theorem [\ref=thm-rigidity-bounded] in Section 4 and the Riemannian positive mass theorem [\cite=SchoenYau79] [\cite=Witten81] is that

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold without boundary. Suppose (M,g) is asymptotically Schwarzschild at each end. If there is a static potential on (M,g), then (M,g) is isometric to either the Euclidean space [formula] or a spatial Schwarzschild manifold [formula] with m > 0.

After the initial draft of this paper was completed, we were informed by Piotr Chruciel and Greg Galloway that there in fact exists a spacetime approach toward Question [\ref=ques-main]. Namely, using results in [\cite=CG69] on Cauchy development, results in [\cite=Moncrief76] [\cite=FMM80] [\cite=Chrusciel91] on vacuum KID development (also see [\cite=BC97]), results in [\cite=CO81] concerning existence of boost-type domains, and in particular the result of Beig-Chruciel in [\cite=Beig-Chrusciel-97] which excludes boost-type Killing vector fields under appropriate conditions, Question 1 can also be approached in the spacetime setting.

We deem this spacetime method a very natural, important and physically motivated way to understand the structure of the zero set of static potentials. Comparatively, our approach toward Question [\ref=ques-main] is a purely initial data based method and our method is more elementary.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss local properties of static metrics and prove Theorem [\ref=thm-local-intro]. In Section 3, we analyze static potentials on an asymptotically flat end and prove Theorems [\ref=thm-main-AS] and [\ref=thm-main-dimension]. In Section 4, we provide some discussion of rigidity questions for complete asymptotically flat 3-manifolds which admits a static potential.

The authors want to give deep thanks to Piotr Chruciel and Greg Galloway for introducing them to the spacetime approach mentioned above. The authors also want to thank Justin Corvino, Marc Mars and Richard Schoen for their helpful comments on this work.

Local properties of static metrics

In this section, we assume that (M,g) is a 3-dimensional, connected, smooth Riemannian manifold whose scalar curvature R is zero. By [\eqref=eq-static-f-s], a nontrivial function f is a static potential on (M,g) if

[formula]

In [\cite=Tod-2000], Tod studied the question when a spatial metric could give rise to a static spacetime in more than one way. In our work, we often need to apply Proposition 2 (ii), Corollary 3 (i) and equation (15) in [\cite=Tod-2000]. For convenience, we list these results of Tod in the next Proposition. We also sketch the proof.

Let {e1,e2,e3} be an orthonormal frame that diagonalizes the Ricci curvature at a given point p.

Suppose f is a static potential. Then

Suppose {R11,R22,R33} are distinct and suppose N, V are two positive static potentials. Then V  =  cN for some constant c.

Suppose R11  =  R22  ≠  R33 and suppose N is a positive static potential. If f is another static potential, then Z  =  N- 1f satisfies Z;1  =  Z;2  =  0.

(i) Let [formula] denote indices that run through {1,2,3}. Differentiating the static equation, one has

[formula]

Let Rd acb be the curvature tensor. (In our notation, Rd acb is given by

[formula]

in a local coordinate chart.) Then

[formula]

In 3-dimension, the curvature tensor and the Ricci curvature are related by

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=eq-nabc], [\eqref=eq-cur-ricci] and the fact R = 0 that

[formula]

Take a  =  b  ≠  c and use the fact {e1,e2,e3} diagonalizes [formula], one has

[formula]

Now (i) follows from [\eqref=eq-nac] and the fact R  =  0.

(ii) The assumption on [formula] implies that [formula] has distinct eigenvalues in an open set U. Hence, [formula] on U by (i), which shows V  =  cN for some constant c on U. Since V, N are both harmonic functions, V  =  cN on M by unique continuation.

(iii) Apply (i) to N and f  =  ZN, one has

[formula]

The claim then follows from the fact N  ≠  0 and R11  =  R22  ≠  R33.

The zero set of a static potential, if nonempty, was known to be a totally geodesic hypersurface (cf. [\cite=Corvino]). In the next lemma, we give more geometric properties of this zero set.

(i) Let p∈Σ. If [formula], then along any geodesic γ(t) emanating from p, f(γ(t)) satisfies f'' = (γ',γ')f and f(0) = f'(0) = 0. This implies f is zero near p. By unique continuation, f  =  0 on M, thus a contradiction. Hence, [formula], which implies that Σ is an embedded surface. On Σ, the static equation shows [formula] = 0 and [formula] for any tangent vectors X,Y tangential to Σ, which readily implies that Σ is totally geodesic and [formula].

(ii) Since Σ is totally geodesic, it follows from the Codazzi equation that (ν,X) = 0 for all X tangent to Σ, where ν is the unit normal of Σ. Therefore, [formula] is an eigenvector of [formula].

(iii) Apply Proposition [\ref=prop-tod] (i), one has

[formula]

Since [formula], one concludes R11  =  R22.

(iv) It follows from the Gauss equation, the fact R = 0 and (iii) that K  =    -  R33  =  2R11  =  2R22. As a result, K  =  0  ⇔    =  0 at p.

In what follows, we let [formula].

The assumption on [formula] implies there is an open set U such that [formula] has distinct eigenvalues everywhere in U. By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iii), a static potential f is either positive or negative in U. The claim now follows from Proposition [\ref=prop-tod] (ii).

Given two static potentials, if one of them is positive, one can look at their quotient.

Let {xi} be local coordinates on M. Since N and f = NZ both are solutions to [\eqref=eq-static-1], we have Therefore, NZ;ij =  - N;iZ;j - N;jZ;i or equivalently

[formula]

for any tangent vectors v, w.

Suppose [formula] at some point p. Similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (i), we consider an arbitrary geodesic γ(t) emanating from p. Taking v  =  w  =  γ' in [\eqref=eq-Z-elliptic], we have NZ(γ(t))''  =    -  2N(γ(t))'Z(γ(t))'. As N  >  0 and Z(γ(t))'|t = 0  =  0, we have Z(γ(t))'  =  0, [formula]. Hence Z is a constant near p. By unique continuation [\cite=Aronszajn-1957], Z is a constant on M.

Next, suppose [formula] everywhere. In this case, every level set Z- 1(t), if nonempty, is an embedded hypersurface. Let v and w be tangent vectors tangent to Z- 1(t), [\eqref=eq-Z-elliptic] implies [formula] As N  >  0 and [formula] where [formula] is the second fundamental form of Z- 1(t) with respect to [formula], we have [formula]. Hence Z- 1(t) is totally geodesic, which proves (i).

To prove (ii), let [formula] and w be tangent to Z- 1(t) in [\eqref=eq-Z-elliptic], we have [formula], which implies [formula] Hence [formula] equals a constant on each connected component of Z- 1(t).

For (iii), let [formula] which is a nowhere vanishing vector field. Given any point p∈M, let Σ be a connected hypersurface passing p on which Z is a constant. By considering the integral curves of X starting from Σ and shrinking Σ if necessary, one knows there exists an open neighborhood U of p, diffeomorphic to ( - ε,ε)  ×  Σ for some ε  >  0, on which the metric g takes the form

[formula]

where ∂t  =  X, Z is a constant on each Σt  =  {t}  ×  Σ and gt is the induced metric on Σt. Consider a background metric

[formula]

on U  =  ( - ε,ε)  ×  Σ. Let [formula] be the second fundamental form of Σt in (U,g), (U,) respectively with respect to ∂t. Then [formula] Since [formula] by (i), we have [formula]. Hence [formula] by the fact [formula]. This shows, for each t, gt  =  g0 which is a fixed metric on Σ. By (ii), [formula] is a constant on Σt. Let [formula]. Then Replacing t by [formula], we have g  =  N2dt2  +  g0. This proves (iii).

If (M,g) is not flat at a point, then dim (F)  ≤  2.

Suppose dim (F) > 2. Let f1,f2,f3 be three linearly independent static potentials. Let U be an open set such that g is not flat at every point in U. By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic], [formula] is nonempty. Hence one can find a connected open set V  ⊂  U such that each fi is nowhere vanishing on V. Let {λ1,λ2,λ3} denote the eigenvalues of [formula] in V. {λ1,λ2,λ3} can not be distinct by Proposition [\ref=prop-tod] (ii). The fact g is not flat and R  =  0 shows {λ1,λ2,λ3} can not be identical. Therefore, one may assume λ1  =  λ2  ≠  λ3 in V. Let Z1 = f1 / f3, Z2 = f2 / f3. By Proposition [\ref=prop-tod] (iii), both [formula] and [formula] are parallel to the eigenvector of [formula] with eigenvalue λ3. Therefore, at a point q∈V, [formula] for some constant α. By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-quotient], [formula] in V. So Z1  +  αZ2 is a constant in V. Hence, f1  +  αf2  =  βf3 for some constant β, which is a contradiction.

When the zero set of a given static potential is not empty, we can consider the behavior of another static potential along such a set.

By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iii), (X,Y)  =  λγ(X,Y), [formula] X, Y tangent to Σ, where 2λ  +  (ν,ν)  =  0 and ν is a unit normal to Σ. Therefore, [formula] along Σ. On the other hand, [formula] since Σ is totally geodesic. Hence [formula] where we have used K  =  2λ by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iv).

Let {xα} be local coordinates on Σ. Taking divergence and trace of [\eqref=eq-f-on-zeroset], we have

[formula]

where ΔΣ is the Laplacian on (Σ,γ). It follows from [\eqref=eq-div-and-trace] that which implies (Kf3);α  =  0. Hence, Kf3 is a constant on each connected component of Σ.

To prove the main result in this section, we need an additional lemma in connection with Lemma [\ref=lma-static-quotient] (iii).

Take any (t,q)∈( - ε,ε)  ×  Σ, the surface Σt  =  {t}  ×  Σ has zero Gaussian curvature and is totally geodesic in (M,g). Let {e1,e2,e3} be an orthonormal frame at (t,q) which diagonalizes the Ricci curvature and satisfies [formula]. Then R33  =  0 by the Gaussian equation. Hence, R11  +  R22  =  0. If R11  ≠  R22, then [formula] has distinct eigenvalues at (t,q) and Lemma [\ref=lma-distinct] implies  dim (F)  ≤  1, contradicting to the assumption  dim (F)  ≥  2. Therefore R11  =  R22  =  0 by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-quotient] (iii). We conclude that g has zero curvature at (t,q).

Suppose  dim (F)  ≥  2. Let f1 and f2 be two linearly independent static potentials. Let P1, P2 be a connected component of f- 11(0), f- 12(0) respectively. If [formula], then

(M,g) is flat along [formula].

(M,g) is flat in an open set which contains [formula] and [formula].

First we note that [formula] is an embedded curve (hence a geodesic since both P1 and P2 are totally geodesic). This is because f1 and f2 are linearly independent, which implies [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent at any point in [formula].

Now let K1, K2 be the Gaussian curvature of P1, P2 respectively. By Lemma [\ref=lma-eq-on-zero], K1f32  =  C for some constant C on P1 and K2f31  =  D for some constant D on P2. Since f1  =  f2  =  0 on [formula], we have C  =  D  =  0. As [formula], [formula] consists of embedded curves, we conclude K1  =  0 on P1 and K2  =  0 on P2. Consequently g is flat along [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iv). This proves (i).

To prove (ii), let p be an arbitrary point in [formula], then f2 does not vanish in an open set U containing p. Consider Z  =  f1  /  f2 on U. We have Z  =  0 on [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-quotient] (iii), there exists an open neighborhood W of p, diffeomorphic to ( - ε,ε)  ×  Σ, where Σ is a small piece of P1 containing p, and Z is a constant on each {t}  ×  Σ, such that on W the metric g takes the form of

[formula]

where g0 is the induced metric on Σ. By (i), (Σ,g0) has zero Gaussian curvature. Since dim (F)  ≥  2 on (W,g), Lemma [\ref=lma-zero-curvature] implies that g is flat in W. Similarly, we know g is flat in an open neighborhood of any point in [formula]. Therefore, (ii) is proved.

To end this section, we apply the analyticity of a static metric to improve Proposition [\ref=prop-two-zeros]. It is known that, if (M,g) admits a static potential f, then g is analytic in harmonic coordinates around any point p with f(p)  ≠  0 (cf. [\cite=Corvino]).

Suppose  dim (F)  ≥  2. Let f1 and f2 be two linearly independent static potentials. If [formula] is nonempty, then (M,g) is flat.

Let [formula]. Given any [formula], either f1(p)  ≠  0 or f2(p)  ≠  0, hence there exists an open set containing p in which g is analytic. As f1 and f2 are linearly independent, S is an embedded curve. In particular [formula] is path-connected. Therefore, by Proposition [\ref=prop-two-zeros] (ii), we conclude that g is flat in [formula], hence flat in M.

We note that a much stronger analytic property of static metrics was shown by Chruciel in [\cite=Chrusciel-analytic]. Theorem [\ref=thm-local-flat] also follows from Proposition [\ref=prop-two-zeros] and the result of Chruciel in [\cite=Chrusciel-analytic].

static potentials on an asymptotically flat end

In this section, unless otherwise stated, we assume that M is diffeomorphic to [formula], where B(ρ) is an open Euclidean ball centered at the origin with radius ρ > 0, and g is a smooth metric on M such that with respect to the standard coordinates {xi} on [formula], g satisfies

[formula]

for some constant [formula]. We also assume that g has zero scalar curvature.

On such an (M,g), a static potential f is necessarily smooth up to ∂M by [\eqref=eq-static-c] and the assumption that g is smooth up to ∂M (cf. [\cite=Corvino]). The following lemma shows that at infinity f has at most linear growth.

Let [formula] denote the Riemann curvature tensor of g. By the AF condition [\eqref=eq-AF-def], we have

[formula]

where r  =  |x|. Therefore, given any ε > 0, there is r0  >  ρ such that

[formula]

if |x| > r0. Here [formula], where Sr0  =  ∂B(r0), the Euclidean sphere with radius r0. Given any x outside Sr0, let γ(t), t∈[r0,T], be a minimal geodesic parametrized by arc length connecting x and Sr0 with γ(r0)∈Sr0 and γ(T)  =  x. Then f(t) = f(γ(t)) satisfies

[formula]

where h(t)  =  (γ'(t),γ'(t)) satisfies

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Define [formula], where A > 0 is chosen so that [formula] and Aαrα - 10 > a, then w(t) satisfies

[formula]

Suppose |f(t)|  >  w(t) for some t∈[r0,T]. Let

[formula]

Then t1  >  r0 and |f(t1)|  =  w(t1). On

[formula]

|f"(t)|=|h(t)f(t)|≤ ε tw=w"(t).

[formula]

-w'(t)+w'(r)≤ f'(t)-f'(r)≤ w'(t)-w'(r)

[formula]

-w(t)+w(r)< f(t)-f(r)< w(t)-w(r),

[formula]

|f"(t)| =|h(t)f(t)|≤ A|h(t)|t

[formula]

| f (x) | ≤ a + C ( |x| - r ) ,

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lma-linear-growth], we now present the following structure result for static potentials near infinity (cf. [\cite=Beig-Chrusciel-96] and Remark [\ref=rmk-prop-3-1]).

Suppose f is a static potential on (M,g). Then

there exists a tuple (a1,a2,a3) such that where h satisfies ∂h  =  O1(|x|  -  τ) and

(a1,a2,a3)  =  (0,0,0) if and only if f is bounded. In this case, either f  >  0 near infinity or f  <  0 near infinity; moreover, upon rescaling, for some constant m.

By [\eqref=eq-AF-def] and Lemma [\ref=lma-linear-growth], [formula] where r  =  |x|. Let [formula], then

[formula]

for some constant C1. By considering φ restricted to a minimal geodesic emanating from the boundary, as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lma-linear-growth], it is not hard to see that [\eqref=eq-grad-phi] implies φ is bounded. Hence

[formula]

where " ; " denotes covariant derivative and Γkij are the Christoffel symbols. It follows from [\eqref=eq-p2-est] that, for each i,  lim x  →    ∞∂xif exists and is finite. Let ai  =   lim x  →    ∞∂xif and define [formula], then

[formula]

and  lim x  →    ∞∂xi(f - λ) = 0. This implies

[formula]

which then shows

[formula]

Let h = f - λ. This proves (i).

To prove (ii), first suppose a1 = a2 = a3 = 0. Let τ' be any fixed constant with [formula]. Then |f|  =  |h|  =  O(r1  -  τ'), hence [formula]. This combined with |∂xif| = O(r-  τ) implies |∂xi∂xjf| = O(r- 1 - 2τ'), which in turns shows |∂xif| = O(r- 2τ'). Since 2τ' > 1, we conclude that f has a finite limit as x  →    ∞  . In particular, f is bounded.

Next, suppose f is bounded. Then a1,a2,a3 must be zero since h grows slower than a linear function. Moreover,  lim x  →    ∞φ  =  0 since |∂xif|  =  O(r-  τ). Let Σ = f- 1(0). By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic](i), Σ is an embedded totally geodesic surface and φ is a positive constant on any connected component of Σ. We want to prove that Σ is bounded.

Let P be any connected component of Σ, then P must be bounded (hence compact), for otherwise contradicting to the fact  lim x  →    ∞φ  =  0 and φ is a positive constant on P. Next, note that there is R0 > 0 such that ∂B(R), [formula], has positive mean curvature in (M,g). Therefore, for each fixed P, [formula] by the maximum principle and the fact that P is a compact embedded minimal surface. Since R0 is independent of P, this implies [formula], therefore either f  >  0 or f  <  0 on {|x|  >  R0}.

To complete the proof, let a  =   lim x  →    ∞f (which was shown to exists). Since Δf = 0, we have f  =  a  +  A|x| -  1  +  o(|x|- 1) for some constant A (cf. [\cite=Bartnik-1986]). We want to show a  ≠  0. Suppose a  =  0. By what we have proved, we may assume f > 0 near infinity. Let R  >  0 be a constant such that f  >  0 on SR  =  ∂B(R). Let ψ be a harmonic function outside SR such that ψ  =   inf SRf  >  0 on SR and  lim x  →    ∞  ψ  =  0. Then f  ≥  ψ by the maximum principle. Since ψ behaves like the Green's function which has a decay order of [formula], we have A  >  0. On the other hand, the assumption a  =  0 implies f  =  O(|x| -  1), hence [formula]. Since |∂xif| = O(r- 2τ'), we have |∂xi∂xjf| = O(r- 3 - τ) + O(r- 1 - τ  -  2τ') which implies |∂xif| = O(r- 3τ'). Iterating this argument and using the fact τ' can be chosen arbitrarily close to τ, we conclude |∂xi∂xjf| = O(r- 3 - τ) and |∂xif|  =  O(r- 2  -  τ). This together with a  =  0 shows |f| = O(r- 1 - τ), contradicting the fact A > 0. Therefore, a  ≠  0. Multiplying f by a nonzero constant, we conclude f = 1 - m|x| -  1 + o(|x|- 1) for some constant m. This complete the proof of (ii).

Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] was also stated in a more general setting by Beig and Chruciel in [\cite=Beig-Chrusciel-96] for KID (Killing initial data). The proof of [\cite=Beig-Chrusciel-96] was briefly outlined in Appendix C in [\cite=Beig-Chrusciel-96]. For the convenience of the reader, we have presented a detailed proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f].

The next proposition describes the zero set of a static potential f near infinity in the case that f is unbounded.

Suppose f is an unbounded static potential on (M,g). There exists a new set of coordinates {yi} on [formula] obtained by a rotation of {xi} such that, outside a compact set, f- 1(0) is given by the graph of a smooth function q  =  q(y2,y3) over

[formula]

for some constant C > 0, where q satisfies

[formula]

Here   =  (y2,y3). As a result, if γR  ⊂  f- 1(0) is the curve given by

[formula]

and κ is the geodesic curvature of γR in f- 1(0), then

[formula]

Let (a1,a2,a3) and h be given by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] such that [formula]. As f is unbounded, (a1,a2,a3)  ≠  (0,0,0). We can rescale f so that [formula]. Hence, there exists new coordinates {yi} obtained by a rotation of {xi} such that

[formula]

where h satisfies

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=eq-f-h] and [\eqref=eq-h-y] that

[formula]

Therefore there exists a constant C  >  0 such that

[formula]

For any fixed (y2,y3)∈ΩC, [\eqref=eq-f-h] and [\eqref=eq-h-y] imply

[formula]

Hence the set [formula] and is given by the graph of some function q  =  q(y2,y3) defined on ΩC. Since [formula] on f- 1(0), q is a smooth function by the implicit function theorem. Given the constant C, [\eqref=eq-f-h] and [\eqref=eq-h-y] imply there exists another constant C1  >  0 such that

[formula]

Therefore, This proves that, outside a compact set, f- 1(0) is given by the graph of q over ΩC.

Next we estimate q and its derivatives. The equation

[formula]

and [\eqref=eq-h-y] imply that, if || is large, for some constant C2  >  0. This in turn implies, as ||  →    ∞  , Let α,β∈{2,3}. Taking derivative of [\eqref=eq-of-q], we have

[formula]

Similarly, by taking derivative of [\eqref=eq-D-1], we have [formula].

To verify [\eqref=eq-g-curvature], we consider the pulled back metric σ  =  F*(g) on ΩC where [formula] is given by F(y2,y3)  =  (q(y2,y3),y2,y3). It follows from [\eqref=eq-AF-def] and [\eqref=eq-condition-q] that

[formula]

where σαβ  =  σ(∂yα,∂yβ) and hαβ satisfies

[formula]

Direct calculation using [\eqref=eq-decay-sigma] and [\eqref=eq-decay-tau] then shows

[formula]

while the length of CR is 2πR  +  O(R1 - τ). From this, we conclude that [\eqref=eq-g-curvature] holds.

In [\cite=Beig-Schoen], Beig and Schoen solved static n-body problem in the case that there exists a closed, noncompact, totally geodesic surface disjoint from the bodies. One may compare Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset] with Proposition 2.1 in [\cite=Beig-Schoen].

Now we are ready to prove the main results of this section.

Let (M,g) be a connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold with or without boundary. If dim (F)  ≥  2, then (M,g) is flat.

It suffices to prove this result on an end of (M,g). So we assume M is diffeomorphic to [formula] minus an open ball. Suppose f and [formula] are two linearly independent static potentials. We have the following three cases:

Case 1. Suppose both f and [formula] are bounded. By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii), after rescaling, we have

[formula]

for some constants m,. Therefore, f  -   is a bounded static potential satisfying [formula]. This contradicts Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii). Hence, this case does not occur.

Case 2. Suppose f is bounded and [formula] is unbounded. By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f], upon a rotation of coordinates and scaling, we may assume that  = x1 + h, where h satisfies the properties in Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f](i), and [formula] for some constant m. Let r0  >  ρ be a fixed constant such that [formula] on {|x|  ≥  r0}, and Sr  =  ∂B(r) has positive mean curvature [formula]. Let λ0 > 0 be another constant such that if λ  >  λ0, λ: =   -  λf will be negative on Sr0. For each λ  >  λ0, let Σλ  =  {x | λ(x)  =  0, |x|  ≥  r0}. Then [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset]. As λ  <  0 on Sr0, Σł does not intersect Sr0. Hence Σł is a surface without boundary. Let P be any connected component of Σł. Since (M,g) is foliated by positive mean curvature surfaces {Sr} outside Sr0 and P is an embedded minimal surface without boundary, P cannot be compact by the maximum principle. By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset], we have P  =  Σł. Let K be the Gaussian curvature of Σł. By Lemma [\ref=lma-eq-on-zero], Kf3  =  C for some constant C along Σł. Note that  lim x  →    ∞K  =  0 because g is asymptotically flat and Σł is totally geodesic. This implies C  =  0 since f is bounded. Hence Kf3  =  0 on Σł. As f  >  0 outside Sr0, we conclude K  =  0. Hence, (M,g) is flat along Σł by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic](iv).

Thus we have proved that (M,g) is flat at every point in the set

[formula]

By the growth condition on h, we know that there exists a constant a > 0 such that for all x1 > a and all [formula] with x22  +  x23  <  1,

[formula]

Clearly this implies that these points (x1,x2,x3)∈U and U contains a nonempty interior. Let [formula]. [formula] is either M itself or M minus an embedded curve, hence [formula] is path-connected. Since g is analytic on [formula] which intersects U, we conclude that g is flat on [formula], hence flat everywhere in M.

Case 3. Suppose both f and [formula] are unbounded. By the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset], upon a rotation of coordinates and scaling, we may assume f  =  x1  +  h,   =  a1x1  +  a2x2  +  a3x3  +  h̃, where h = O(|x|θ), h̃ = O(|x|θ) for some constant 0  <  θ  <  1, and ai, i  =  1,2,3, are some constants. Moreover, we can assume that f- 1(0), outside a compact set, is given by the graph of q  =  q(x2,x3) where q  =  O(|x2|θ  +  |x3|θ).

Replacing [formula] by  - a1f, we may assume a1 = 0. In this case, if a2  =  a3  =  0, then Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii) implies that [formula] is bounded and we are back to Case 2. Therefore we may assume (a2,a3)  ≠  (0,0). Without loss of generality, we can assume a2 = 1 upon rescaling [formula] so that   =  x2  +  a3x3  +  h̃. Given any large positive number a, consider the point x+  =  (q(a,0),a,0) which lies in f- 1(0). We have

[formula]

Hence (x+)  >  0 if a is sufficiently large. Similarly, we have (x-)  <  0, where x-  =  (q(  -  a,0),  -  a,0), for large a. Since x+ and x- can be joint by a curve that is contained in the graph of q, hence in f- 1(0), we conclude

[formula]

Therefore (M,g) is flat by Theorem [\ref=thm-local-flat].

Let g be a smooth metric on [formula], where B(ρ) is an open ball, such that

[formula]

where pij(x)  =  O2(|x|- 2) and m  ≠  0 is a constant. If f is a static potential of (M,g), then f does not vanish outside a compact set.

By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii), it suffices to prove that f is bounded. Suppose f is unbounded, by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset] there exists a new set of coordinates {yi}, obtained by a rotation of {xi}, such that the zero set of f which we denote by Σ, outside a compact set, is given by the graph of a smooth function q  =  q(y2,y3) defined on

[formula]

for some constant C > 0. Here q satisfies [\eqref=eq-condition-q] with τ  =  1.

Since {yi} differs from {xi} only by a rotation, the asymptotically Schwarzschild condition [\eqref=eq-AS] is preserved in the {yi} coordinates, i.e.

[formula]

where pij(y)  =  O2(|y|- 2). The Ricci curvature of g now can be estimated explicitly in terms of y. By [\cite=Huisken-Yau1996], [\eqref=eq-AS-y] implies

[formula]

where [formula].

Given any   =  (y2,y3)∈ΩC, let y  =  (q(),y2,y3) and TyΣ be the tangent space to Σ at y. As a subspace in [formula], TyΣ is spanned by

[formula]

Let |v|g, |w|g be the length of v, w with respect to g respectively. Define ṽ  =  |v|- 1gv,w̃  =  |w|- 1gw, we want to compare

[formula]

when || is large. By [\eqref=eq-condition-q] and [\eqref=eq-Ricci-est], we have

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

On the other hand, [\eqref=eq-condition-q] and [\eqref=eq-AS-y] imply

[formula]

Therefore, it follows from [\eqref=eq-Ric-v] - [\eqref=eq-v-length] that

[formula]

Together with [\eqref=eq-condition-q], this shows that there exists (y2,y3) such that (ṽ,ṽ)  ≠  (w̃,w̃) when || is large. For instance, let y2  =  0 and y3  →    +    ∞  , then

[formula]

This is a contradiction to Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iii). We conclude that f must be bounded.

Rigidity of static asymptotically flat manifolds

In this section, we consider a complete, asymptotically flat 3-manifold without boundary, with finitely many ends, on which there exists a static potential f. Two basic examples are

The Euclidean space [formula]. Here [formula] and {ai} are constants.

A spatial Schwarzschild manifold with mass m  >  0, i.e. [formula]. In this case, [formula].

A natural question is whether these are the only examples of such manifolds? We start by showing that f must have nonempty zero set unless the manifold is [formula].

By Bochner's formula and the static equation [\eqref=eq-static-f-s],

[formula]

wherever f  ≠  0. Suppose f- 1(0) is empty, then Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset] implies f is bounded. By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii), [formula] at each end of (M,g). Hence there is p∈M such that [formula] By [\eqref=eq-MP] and the strong maximum principle, [formula] must be a constant and hence is identically zero. Therefore, f is a nonzero constant and  = 0 everywhere. This shows (M,g) is flat and hence isometric to [formula] by volume comparison as (M,g) is asymptotically flat.

In [\cite=Bunting-Masood], Bunting and Masood-ul-Alam proved that if (M,g) is an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with boundary, with one end, on which there is a static potential f which goes to 1 at ∞   and is 0 on ∂M, then (M,g) is isometric to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass outside its horizon. By examining the proof in [\cite=Bunting-Masood], we observe that the result in [\cite=Bunting-Masood] holds on manifolds with any number of ends.

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold with nonempty boundary, with possibly more than one end. Suppose f is a static potential such that f > 0 in the interior and f = 0 on ∂M. Then (M,g) is isometric to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass outside its horizon.

Since f  >  0 away from the boundary, f must be bounded by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset]. Upon scaling, we may assume sup Mf = 1. Suppose (M,g) has k ends E1, [formula], Ek, k  ≥  1. For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii) implies lim x  →    ∞  ,x∈Eif(x) = ai for some constant 0 < ai  ≤  1. By the maximal principal, ai  =  1 for some i. Without losing generality, we may assume a1 = 1.

We proceed as in [\cite=Bunting-Masood]. Define γ+ = (1 + f)4g and γ- = (1 - f)4g. Then the following are true:

γ+ and γ- have zero scalar curvature (cf. Lemma 1 in [\cite=Bunting-Masood]).

If aj  =  1, then Ej is an asymptotically flat end in (M,γ+) and the mass of (M,γ+) at Ej is zero; on the other hand, Ej gets compactified in (M,γ-) in the sense that if pj is the point of infinity at Ej, then there is a W2,q extension of γ- to [formula] (cf. Lemma 2 and 3 in [\cite=Bunting-Masood])

If aj  <  1, then clearly Ej is an asymptotically flat end in both (M,γ+) and (M,γ-).

Glue (M,γ+) and (M,γ-) along ∂M to obtain a manifold (,), then [formula] is C1,1 across ∂M in [formula] (cf. Lemma 4 in [\cite=Bunting-Masood]). Apply the Riemannian positive mass theorem as stated in [\cite=Bunting-Masood] and use the fact that the mass of E1 in (,) is zero, we conclude that (,) is isometric to [formula]. In particular, this shows that (M,g) only has one end. The rest now follows from the main theorem in [\cite=Bunting-Masood].

Proposition [\ref=prop-B-M] can be used to answer the rigidity question in the case that f is bounded.

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold without boundary, with finitely many ends. If there exists a bounded static potential on (M,g), then (M,g) is isometric to either [formula] or a spatial Schwarzschild manifold [formula] with m > 0.

Let f be a bounded static potential. If (M,g) has only one end, then f must be a constant by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii) and the fact Δf  =  0. Hence, (M,g) is flat and is isometric to [formula].

Next suppose (M,g) has more than one end, in particular (M,g) is not isometric to [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lma-zero-exist], [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (i) and Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii), f- 1(0) is a closed totally geodesic hypersurface (possibly disconnected); moreover f changes sign near f- 1(0). Let N1 be a component of {f > 0}, then N1 is unbounded as f  =  0 on ∂N. Since f is either positive or negative near the infinity of each end of (M,g), N1 must be asymptotically flat, with possibly more than one end, with nonempty boundary Σ on which f = 0. By Proposition [\ref=prop-B-M] and [\cite=Bunting-Masood], (N1,g) is isometric to [formula] with some constant m1  >  0.

Similarly, let N2 be the component of {f < 0} whose boundary contains Σ. By the same argument, we know that (N2,g) is isometric to [formula] for some m2  >  0. Since M is connected, we conclude that [formula].

Now we have Σ  =  {|x| = 2m1}  =  {|y| = 2m2}. As the area of Σ is given by 16πm21 and 16πm22 respectively, we have m1  =  m2. This proves that (M,g) is isometric to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass.

Next, we consider the rigidity question without the boundedness assumption of f. We recall that, by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii) and Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset], the zero set of a static potential on an asymptotically flat manifold has only finitely many components.

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold without boundary, with finitely many ends E1, [formula], Ek. Suppose there exists a static potential f on (M,g). Then

[formula].

[formula]. Here {Σα | 0  ≤  α  ≤  m} and {Σ̃β | 0  ≤  β  ≤  n} are the sets of unbounded components and bounded components of f- 1(0) respectively. [formula] and β  >  0 are the constants which equal [formula] on [formula] and Σ̃β respectively. For each α, [formula] is the number of ends Ei with [formula]. [formula] and χ(Σ̃β) denote the Euler characteristic of [formula] and Σ̃β.

At each end Ei, 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, let {y1,y2,y3} be a set of coordinates in which g satisfies [\eqref=eq-AF-def]. If f is unbounded in Ei, we require that {y1,y2,y3} be given by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset]. For any large r > 0, let Sir be the coordinate sphere {|y| = r} in Ei. Let Ur be the region bounded by S1r, [formula], Skr in M.

By Lemma [\ref=lma-linear-growth] and [\eqref=eq-AF-def], |f|  =  O(r) and || = O(r- 2 - τ) in each Ei. Hence, the integrals in (i) and (ii) exist and are finite. The static equation [\eqref=eq-static-f-s] implies

[formula]

Integrating [\eqref=eq-f-Ric-2] over Ur and doing integration by parts, we have

[formula]

where ν is the unit outward normal to Sir and we also have used the fact g has zero scalar curvature. Since [formula] is bounded by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f], || = O(r- 2 - τ), and the area of Sir is of order r2, we conclude that (i) holds by letting r  →    ∞   in [\eqref=eq-f-Ric-2-Ur].

To prove (ii), we first choose r sufficient large so that Σ̃β  ⊂  Ur, [formula]. If f is unbounded, we assume it is unbounded in the ends E1, [formula], El, 1  ≤  l  ≤  k, and bounded in the other ends. We then choose r large enough so that outside each Sir in Ei, 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, f- 1(0) is the graph of some function q  =  q() given by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset]; moreover, by [\eqref=eq-condition-q] we can assume the graph of q() always intersects Sir transversally. Hence, the set [formula] has Lipschitz boundary. Integrating [\eqref=eq-f-Ric-2] over U+r gives

[formula]

Here ν denotes the outward unit normal to ∂U+r. As in (i),

[formula]

On each Σ̃β or [formula], by the fact [formula], we have

[formula]

where K is the Gaussian curvature of Σ̃β or [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (iv). Hence,

[formula]

by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and

[formula]

Note that [formula] is totally geodesic, hence [\eqref=eq-AF-def] implies that |K| decays on Σα in the order of O(|y|- 2  -  τ) in each end Ei with [formula]. But [\eqref=eq-condition-q] implies that, on [formula], |y| is equivalent to the intrinsic distance function to a fixed point in [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Let CiR be the curve in [formula] which is the graph of q over the circle {||  =  R} (see the definition of CR in Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset]). Let κ denote the geodesic curvature of CiR in Σα. By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-zeroset], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the set of indices i such that [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=eq-unbounded-int] - [\eqref=eq-total-K-alpha] that

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq-unbounded-1] - [\eqref=eq-bounded-int] and [\eqref=eq-GB-Sigma-a], we conclude that

[formula]

(ii) now follows from [\eqref=eq-int-f-positive] and (i).

From [\eqref=eq-decay-sigma] and [\eqref=eq-decay-tau], one can show [formula] where A(r) is the area of [formula], [formula], for a geodesic ball D(r) with radius r in [formula]. Therefore, the fact [formula] also follows from results in [\cite=Hartman1964] [\cite=Shiohama85].

Proposition [\ref=prop-integration] implies that (M,g) must be [formula] if M has simple topology.

Let (M,g) and f be given as in Proposition [\ref=prop-integration]. If M is orientable and every 2-sphere in M is the boundary of a bounded domain, then (M,g) is isometric to [formula]. In particular, if M is homeomorphic to [formula], then (M,g) is isometric to [formula].

Suppose Σ̃β is a compact component of f- 1(0). Since M is orientable and Σ̃β is two-sided (with a nonzero normal [formula]), Σ̃β is orientable. If χ(Σ̃β)  >  0, then Σ̃β is a 2-sphere. Hence Σ̃β  =  ∂Ω for some bounded domain Ω in M by the assumption. This implies [formula] in Ω by the maximum principal and therefore [formula] in M by unique continuation [\cite=Aronszajn-1957]. Thus, (M,g) is flat and is isometric to [formula]. However, [formula] does not contain any closed minimal surface. Hence, we must have χ(Σ̃β)  ≤  0 for all compact components Σ̃β of f- 1(0) if such a component exists. On the other hand, if [formula] is a noncompact component of f- 1(0), then [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop-integration] (ii), we have This implies [formula] and therefore (M,g) is isometric to [formula].

In what follows, we replace the topological assumption in Theorem [\ref=thm-simple-top] by an assumption that f has no critical points. For this purpose, we analyze the behavior of integral curves of the gradient of a static potential. We formulate the results in a setting similar to that in Proposition [\ref=prop-B-M].

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold with nonempty boundary, with finitely many ends E1, [formula], Ek. Suppose there exists a static potential f with f = 0 on ∂M. Given any point [formula], the interior of M, let γp(t) be the integral curve of [formula] with γp(0) = p. Let (α,β) be the maximal interval of existence of γp inside [formula].

If β  <    ∞  , then lim t  →  βγp(t) = x for some x∈∂M; if α >  -   ∞  , then lim t  →  αγp(t) = y for some y∈∂M. Consequently, either α =  -   ∞   or β  =    ∞  .

If β  =    ∞  , then lim t  →    ∞f(γp(t)) = b >  -   ∞  . Moreover,

if b =   ∞  , then, as t  →    ∞  , γp(t) tends to infinity in an end Ei on which f is unbounded;

if b <   ∞  , then b  ≠  0 and [formula];

if b < 0, then [formula] and consists of critical points of f.

If α =  -   ∞  , then lim t  →    -    ∞f(γp(t)) = a <   ∞  . Moreover,

if a =  -   ∞  , then, as t  →    -    ∞  , γp(t) tends to infinity in an end Ei on which f is unbounded;

if a >  -   ∞  , then a  ≠  0 and [formula];

if a > 0, then [formula] and consists of critical points of f.

If p is a critical point of f, then γp(t) = p, [formula]. Also [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (i). The proposition is obviously true in this case. In the following, we assume [formula]. Then [formula] for all t and

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f], [formula] exists and is finite at each end Ei. Therefore,

[formula]

for some constant B > 0. Suppose β  <    ∞  , then for t2  >  t1 > 0, where d(  ·  ,  ·  ) denotes the distance on (M,g). Hence lim t  →  βγp(t) = x for some x∈M. Since (α,β) is the maximal interval of existence of γp(t) in [formula], we conclude x∈∂M. Similarly, if α >  -   ∞  , then lim t  →  βγp(t) = y, for some y∈∂M. If α >  -   ∞   and β  <    ∞  , then f(x) = 0 = f(y), which contradicts [\eqref=eq-integralcurve-1]. This proves (a).

To prove (b), we note that [\eqref=eq-integralcurve-1] implies f(γp(t)) is increasing, hence lim t  →    ∞f(γp(t))  =  b exists and b  >    -    ∞  . If b =   ∞  , then there exists tn  →    ∞   such that γp(tn)  →    ∞   in some end Ei on which f is unbounded. Let {tn'} be any other sequence with tn'  →    ∞  . We claim that γp(tn') must tend to infinity in Ei as well. Otherwise, passing to subsequence, we may assume that γp(tn') tends to infinity in another end Ej with j  ≠  i. But this implies that, for large n, there exists tn'' between tn and tn' such that γp(tn'') lies in a fixed compact set K of M (for instance the set K used in Definition [\ref=def-def-AF]). This contradicts the fact  lim n  →    ∞f(γp(tn''))  →  b  =    ∞  . Therefore, γp(t) tends to infinity in Ei as t  →    ∞  , which proves (i) in (b).

Next, suppose b <   ∞  . Let {tn} be any sequence such that tn  →    ∞  . Given any fixed number [formula], we have Hence there exists tn'∈[tn   -   δ,tn   +   δ] such that [formula]. Define Bγp(tn)(1)  =  {q∈M | d(q,γp(tn))  <  1}. For large n, [\eqref=eq-integralcurve-2] implies |f| < 2|b| + 2B on Bγ(tn))(1). This together with the fact [formula] and (M,g) is asymptotically flat implies

[formula]

on Bγ(tn))(1) for some constant C1 independent on n and δ. Now let [formula], then [formula] is dual to the 1-form [formula] By [\eqref=eq-integralcurve-2] and [\eqref=eq-Hessf-bd], we conclude

[formula]

on Bγ(tn))(1) by a constant C2 independent on n and δ. Note that d(γ(tn),γ(tn'))  ≤  δB  <  1, we therefore have

[formula]

Since [formula] and δ can be arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that φ(γp(tn))  →  0 as n  →    ∞  .

We also want to show [formula]. Let {tn} be given as above. Suppose {γp(tn)} is unbounded, then passing to a subsequence we may assume γp(tn)  →    ∞   in some end Ej. If f is unbounded in Ej, we would have [formula] for some C3 > 0 independent of n by Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (i), contradicting to the fact [formula]. Hence, f is bounded in Ej. By Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii), we have [formula]. Next, suppose {γp(tn)} is bounded. Passing to a subsequence, we may assume γp(tn) = q∈M. Then q is a critical point of f since [formula]. Therefore, b = f(q)  ≠  0 by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (i). This completes the proof of (ii) in (b).

To prove (iii) of (b), it is sufficient to prove that if b < 0 and if {tn} is a sequence tending to ∞  , then {γp(tn)} must be bounded, hence containing a subsequence converging to a critical point in M. Suppose {γ(tn)} is unbounded, then passing to a subsequence we may assume γ(tn)  →    ∞   in an end Ej where f is bounded by the proof in (ii) above. On Ej, Proposition [\ref=prop-AF-static-f] (ii) implies

[formula]

where A is a constant such that which is the mass of (M,g) at the end of Ej (cf. [\cite=Beig-1980] [\cite=Bunting-Masood]). By the positive mass theorem [\cite=SchoenYau79] [\cite=Witten81], we have m  >  0 (which can be seen by reflecting (M,g) through ∂M since ∂M is totally geodesic). Therefore, A  <  0 because b < 0. As a result, f(γp(tn))  >  b for large n by [\eqref=eq-f-expan-4-p]. But this leads to a contradiction to the fact that b  =   lim n  →    ∞f(γp(tn)) and f(γp(t)) is strictly increasing in t. Therefore, {γp(tn)} must be bounded. This proves (iii) of (b).

Claim (c) follows from (b) by replacing f by - f.

Using Proposition [\ref=prop-integral-curve], we obtain an analogue of Proposition [\ref=prop-B-M] with the assumption f  >  0 replaced by that f has no critical points.

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂M, with finitely many ends. Suppose there exists a static potential f without critical points such that f = 0 on ∂M. Then (M,g) is isometric to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass outside its horizon.

By definition, ∂M is compact. Let Σ be a component of ∂M. Since [formula] at Σ by Lemma [\ref=lma-static-basic] (i), we may assume that [formula] is inward pointing at Σ. Consider the map [formula] given by F(x,t) = γx(t) which is the integral curve of [formula] such that γx(0) = x∈Σ. By Proposition [\ref=prop-integral-curve] (a), γx is defined on [formula]. Let γy(t) be the integral curve of [formula] with γy(0) = y. Since ti  →    ∞  , {γi(t)} converge uniformly to γy(t) on

[formula]

Corollary [\ref=cor-BM-no-critical-pts] implies the following rigidity theorem.

Let (M,g) be a complete, connected, asymptotically flat 3-manifold without boundary, with finitely many ends. If there exists a static potential f on (M,g) which has no critical points, then (M,g) is isometric to either [formula] or a spatial Schwarzschild manifold [formula] with m > 0.

If f- 1(0) has no compact component, then (M,g) is isometric to [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop-integration] (ii) (cf. the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-simple-top]). Next, suppose f- 1(0) has a compact component Σ. Cutting M along Σ, and let (,) be the metric completion of [formula]. Then either [formula] has two components whose boundary is isometric to Σ, or [formula] is connected with two boundary components that are isometric to Σ. Applying Corollary [\ref=cor-BM-no-critical-pts] to each component of (,) shows that (,) can not be connected, and hence has two components each of which is isometric to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass outside its horizon. Since their boundaries are isometric, we conclude that (M,g) itself is isometric to a complete spatial Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass.
