A note on compressed sensing of structured sparse wavelet coefficients from subsampled Fourier measurements

Introduction

In many applications of compressed sensing, the image or signal [formula] to be recovered is sparse or compressible in an orthonormal wavelet basis [formula]. However, it is well known that the coefficients c  =  Φ*x in such a basis possess far more than mere sparsity. In fact, they are highly structured: if the vector c of wavelet coefficients is divided into dyadic scales, there is far more sparsity at the finer scales than at the coarser scales. In [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt] it was argued that, in order to obtain a better reconstruction with compressed sensing, one should exploit such structure by taking appropriate measurements. This can be achieved by subsampling the discrete Fourier transform in an appropriate way. Not only does this lead to improved reconstructions over standard (sub)Gaussian random measurements, it also explains the success of compressed sensing in applications where the measurements naturally arise from the Fourier transform, e.g. MRI, X-ray CT, etc.

In this note we provide a short, expositional proof of the corresponding recovery result stated in [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt] for the case of one-dimensional discrete Fourier measurements with Haar wavelets. We refer to [\cite=AHPRBreaking] for the proof of the corresponding result for general wavelets in the infinite-dimensional setting. Throughout, we use the same notation as in [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt].

Preliminaries

Let [formula] be a signal. Denote the Fourier transform of x by and write [formula] for the corresponding matrix, so that The concern of this note is the recovery of x from a small subset [formula] of the measurements Fx. We do so using techniques of compressed sensing, by assuming that x is compressible in a Haar wavelet basis. Let n  =  2r for some [formula]. The Haar basis consists of the functions [formula] where and Write [formula] for the matrix corresponding to this basis, and let [formula] be the vector of coefficients of x. We divide c into r levels corresponding to wavelet scales: (note that we now index over [formula], as opposed to [formula] as was done in [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt]) where and Let M0  =  0 and so that c(j) corresponds to the segment of the vector c with indices [formula].

We now wish to specify how to subsample the Fourier transform Fx. Recall that Fx is indexed over [formula]. Proceeding as in [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt], we divide this set up into r frequency bands. Let and and note that [formula] form a disjoint partition of [formula]. Observe that For [formula], we now choose the index set Ωj  ⊆  Wj uniformly at random of size |Ωj|  =  mj. If then the vector of measurements is given by y  =  PΩFx, where the matrix [formula] picks out the elements of Fx with entries in Ω. Equivalently, the measurement matrix A  =  PΩF (see [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt]).

Main theorem

Our concern is signals x for which the vector c is not just approximately sparse, but has a distinct sparsity structure within its wavelet scale. Given the parameters [formula], we recall from [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt] that c is [formula]-sparse in levels, where [formula] if If [formula] denotes the set of such vectors, then we define the best [formula]-term approximation of an arbitrary [formula] by In order to recover such an x from noisy measurements y  =  Ax  +  e with [formula], we consider the convex optimization problem The result we shall prove is the following:

We refer to [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt] for a detailed discussion on the implications of this result. However, note that asserts that we require near-optimal number of measurements mj in the [formula] frequency band to recover the kj significant wavelet coefficients in the corresponding [formula] wavelet band.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t:Fourier_Haar]

Setup

Let [formula] be given by U  =  FΦ*. There is a natural division of U into blocks defined by the sampling and sparsity bands. Let Ujl be restriction of U to rows with indices in Wj and columns with indices [formula]. Note that the entries of Uj,l are and

Recall the coherence μ(V) of matrix [formula] is defined by [formula]. As in [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt], define the [formula] local coherence of the matrix U by Note that the second term is the coherence of the 2j  ×  2r submatrix of U formed by concatenating only those rows in Wj. Given a vector [formula], we also define the relative sparsities (see [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt]) by With these definitions in hand, [\cite=AHRBerlinBookChpt] gives that the conclusions of Theorem [\ref=t:Fourier_Haar] hold, provided [formula] satisfy the following two conditions:

We have

For all [formula] satisfying we have [formula], where j satisfies

Thus, to prove Theorem [\ref=t:Fourier_Haar], we need only show that implies and . To do this, we need to estimate the local coherences μ(j,l) and the relative sparsities Kj. These are subjects of the next two subsections.

The local coherences μ(j,l)

We commence with the following lemma:

We now have the following:

The relative sparsities Kj

From the definition , we have Note that [formula]. Hence and therefore it suffices to estimate [formula].

Using this lemma and , we now deduce that

Final arguments

We are now able to complete the proof of the main result, Theorem [\ref=t:Fourier_Haar]. Recall that it suffices to show that implies and . Consider the right-hand side of . By Lemma [\ref=l:local_coh], Hence implies . Similarly, applying Lemma [\ref=l:local_coh] to the right-hand side of gives Since |Wj|  =  2j and we see that it suffices to take By definition, j  ≤  Kj. Therefore an application of now gives that implies as well. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=t:Fourier_Haar].
