A finiteness theorem for the Brauer group of K3 surfaces in odd characteristic

Introduction

Let k be a field with an algebraic closure k̄, and let [formula] be the separable closure of k in k̄. Let [formula] be the absolute Galois group of k, and let [formula] be the Brauer group of k.

For an irreducible, smooth, projective algebraic variety X over k we write X̄ for the variety [formula] over [formula]. We write [formula] for the Brauer-Grothendieck group of X, and [formula] for the image of the canonical homomorphism [formula] induced by the structure map.

For an abelian group B and a positive integer n we write [formula].

Let [formula] be a prime. For an abelian periodic group B let [formula] be the subgroup of B consisting of the elements of order prime to [formula]. We write [formula] for the [formula]-adic Tate module of B; it has the natural structure of a [formula]-module and is torsion-free. If B has only finitely many elements of order [formula], then [formula] is a free [formula]-module of finite rank. See [\cite=SZ] for more details.

Let X be a K3 surface over k. It is known that the Néron-Severi group [formula] is a free abelian group of rank 22. If [formula], then [formula] is a free [formula]-module of rank 22, and the natural map

[formula]

is an isomorphism of [formula]-modules. By Grothendieck [\cite=Gro] and Tate [\cite=TateDix] there is a short exact sequence of [formula]-modules, which are also free [formula]-modules of finite rank:

[formula]

We identify [formula] with its image in [formula]. Then (1) shows that [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula], that is, the quotient is torsion-free. It is well known that there exists a finite Galois field extension k' / k such that the open finite index subgroup [formula] acts trivially on [formula] and hence on [formula].

We define [formula] as the Galois invariant subgroup [formula]. (Note that the image of [formula] in [formula] is a subgroup of finite index.) In particular, [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula]. We have

[formula]

Since [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula], it is also a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula]. The intersection pairing

[formula]

is non-degenerate, see [\cite=Matsusaka] and also [\cite=Milne]. In particular, the discriminant dX of this pairing is a non-zero integer. On the other hand, there is the Poincaré duality pairing

[formula]

which is perfect and Galois-invariant. The restriction of [formula] to [formula] coincides with the intersection pairing. We define the group of transcendental cycles [formula] as the orthogonal complement to [formula] in [formula] with respect to [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a saturated Galois-stable [formula]-submodule of [formula]. It is also clear that if [formula] does not divide dX, then

[formula]

For any [formula] we have

[formula]

and the direct sum [formula] is a subgroup of finite index in [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a [formula]-submodule of [formula].

Let us consider the [formula]-vector space [formula] with its natural structure of a [formula]-module. We have a natural embedding of Galois modules [formula], from which we obtain

[formula]

K. Madapusi Pera [\cite=Pera] proved that if k is finitely generated over [formula] and p > 2, then

[formula]

This is an important special case of the celebrated Tate conjecture on algebraic cycles [\cite=Tate0]. Closely related results were previously obtained by D. Maulik [\cite=Maulik] and F. Charles [\cite=Charles]. Since [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule in [formula], the theorem of Madapusi Pera is equivalent to

[formula]

Another restatement of the same result is

[formula]

Note that this still holds if k is replaced by any finite separable field extension.

Our results are based on the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces and the existence of the Kuga-Satake variety in odd characteristic, as established by Madapusi Pera in [\cite=Pera], as well as on the results of one of the authors [\cite=ZarhinMZ1].

Let k be a field finitely generated over [formula], where [formula], and let X be a K3 surface over k. For any prime [formula] the Galois module [formula] is semisimple.

This is proved in Theorem [\ref=finiteK3] (i). Our main results are the two following statements whose proofs can be found in the final section of this note.

Let k be a field finitely generated over [formula], where [formula], and let X be a K3 surface over k. Then for all but finitely many [formula] the Galois module [formula] is semisimple and [formula].

Using the method of [\cite=SZ] we deduce from the above results the following finiteness statement.

Let k be a field finitely generated over [formula], where [formula], and let X be a K3 surface over k. Then the group [formula] is finite.

For a K3 surface X over a finitely generated field of characteristic zero, the finiteness of [formula] was proved in [\cite=SZ].

Abelian varieties

Let A be an abelian variety over a field k. We write [formula] for the ring of endomorphisms of A. For a positive integer n not divisible by [formula], we write An for the kernel of multiplication by n in A(k̄). Then An is a [formula]-submodule of [formula].

Let [formula] be a prime. Recall that the [formula]-adic Tate module [formula] is the projective limit of abelian groups [formula], where the transition maps [formula] are multiplications by [formula]. It is well known [\cite=Serre] that [formula] is a free [formula]-module of rank [formula] equipped with a natural continuous action

[formula]

We write [formula], and view [formula] as a [formula]-lattice in [formula]. Then [formula] gives rise to the [formula]-adic representation

[formula]

There are natural canonical isomorphisms of Galois modules [formula] for all i  ≥  1. If we forget about the Galois action, then we can naturally identify the [formula]-modules [formula] and [formula], and the [formula]-vector spaces [formula] and [formula].

There is a natural embedding of [formula]-algebras [formula], whose image is a saturated subgroup [\cite=SerreTate]. We will identify [formula] with its image in [formula]. The natural action of [formula] on [formula] is continuous when [formula] is given discrete topology, so the image of [formula] in [formula] is finite. The ring [formula] coincides with the Galois-invariant subring [formula], see [\cite=Silverberg]. In other words, there is a finite Galois field extension k' / k such that [formula] factors through [formula] and

[formula]

There are natural embeddings of [formula]-algebras

[formula]

of [formula]-algebras

[formula]

and of [formula]-algebras

[formula]

The image of [formula] in [formula] is obviously contained in the centraliser [formula] of [formula] in [formula]. Similar statements hold if [formula] is replaced by [formula] or [formula].

For each prime [formula] let us consider the [formula]-bilinear trace form

[formula]

This form is Galois-invariant, symmetric and non-degenerate. The same formula defines a perfect (unimodular) [formula]-bilinear form on [formula]. The restriction of this form to [formula] takes values in [formula] and does not depend on the choice of [formula], see [\cite=Mumford].

Let us choose a polarisation on A and write u  ↦  u' for the corresponding Rosati involution on [formula], see [\cite=Mumford]. Then [formula] is a positive rational number if [formula], see [\cite=Lang] or [\cite=Mumford]. This implies that the [formula]-invariant form

[formula]

is non-degenerate (but not necessarily perfect) and does not depend on [formula]. Since the Rosati involution commutes with the action of [formula], and [formula], the bilinear form

[formula]

is also non-degenerate, and therefore its discriminant dA is a non-zero integer that does not depend on [formula].

The following assertion was proved by one of the authors [\cite=ZarhinIz] [\cite=ZarhinMZ1] in [formula], by Faltings [\cite=Faltings1] [\cite=Faltings2] in [formula] and by Mori [\cite=MB] in [formula]. (See also [\cite=ZarhinP] [\cite=ZarhinCEJM14].)

Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield and let A be an abelian variety over k. For a prime [formula] we have

(i) [formula] and [formula];

(ii) the Galois module [formula] is semisimple.

When k is finite, the assertion (i) of Theorem [\ref=tateSS] was proved by Tate [\cite=Tate], who conjectured that it holds for an arbitrary finitely generated field. He also proved that the two formulae in (i) are equivalent for any given [formula]. The semisimplicity of [formula] for finite k was established earlier by Weil [\cite=Mumford].

The following assertion was proved in [\cite=ZarhinMZ2] [\cite=ZarhinInv] [\cite=ZarhinCEJM14].

Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield, and let A be an abelian variety over k. Then for all but finitely many primes [formula] the Galois module [formula] is semisimple and [formula].

Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield, and let A be an abelian variety over k. Let P be an infinite set of primes that does not contain [formula]. Suppose that for each [formula] we are given a [formula]-submodule [formula] such that [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula] and [formula]. Then for all but finitely many [formula] we have [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=tateSS](ii) the Galois module [formula] is semisimple, and by a theorem of Chevalley [\cite=Chev] this implies that [formula] is also semisimple. The Galois submodules [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal in [formula] with respect to the Galois-invariant bilinear form [formula], because otherwise [formula], which contradicts the assumption [formula]. It follows that [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal, too.

Now assume that [formula] does not divide dA. Then the [formula]-bilinear symmetric Galois-invariant form

[formula]

is perfect. Thus the Galois module [formula] splits into a direct sum

[formula]

where [formula] is the orthogonal complement to [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a Galois-stable saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula]. We have natural isomorphisms of Galois modules

[formula]

Thus reducing modulo [formula], we obtain a Galois-invariant decomposition

[formula]

This gives rise to

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=finite] implies that for all but finitely many [formula] we have [formula]. Since [formula] is orthogonal to [formula], we have [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula], and this implies that the natural map [formula] is injective. We conclude that [formula] for all but finitely many [formula].

Recall if [formula] does not divide a positive integer n, then we have a canonical isomorphism of Galois modules

[formula]

For a prime [formula] we deduce canonical isomorphisms of Galois modules

[formula]

[formula]

where the last identification is an anti-isomorphism of rings. This allows us to restate Proposition [\ref=tech] in the following form.

Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield, and let A be an abelian variety over k. Let P be an infinite set of primes that does not contain [formula]. Suppose that for each [formula] we are given a [formula]-submodule

[formula]

such that [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula] and [formula]. Then for all but finitely many [formula] we have [formula].

Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield, and let A be an abelian variety over k. Then

(i) the [formula]-module [formula] is semisimple for any prime [formula];

(ii) the [formula]-module [formula] is semisimple for all but finitely many primes [formula].

(i) We have a [formula]-algebra anti-isomorphism

[formula]

which is also an isomorphism of Galois modules. By Theorem [\ref=tateSS] the Galois module [formula] is semisimple, and then Chevalley's theorem [\cite=Chev] implies the semisimplicity of [formula].

(ii) We have an [formula]-algebra anti-isomorphism

[formula]

which is also an isomorphism of Galois modules. By Theorem [\ref=finite] the Galois module [formula] is semisimple for all but finitely many [formula]. By a theorem of Serre [\cite=SerreSS], if [formula] is greater than [formula], then the semisimplicity of [formula] implies the semisimplicity of the Galois module [formula]. This finishes the proof of (ii).

Clifford Algebras and Kuga-Satake construction

Let Λ be a principal ideal domain and let E be a free Λ-module of finite rank with a non-degenerate quadratic form q:E  →  Λ. Let C(E,q) be the Clifford algebra of (E,q). Let ϱ:E  →  C(E,q) be the canonical Λ-linear homomorphism satisfying

[formula]

The map ϱ is injective by [\cite=Bourbaki], so that [formula]. It follows from [\cite=Bourbaki] that C(E,q) is a free Λ-module of finite rank, and the Λ-submodule ϱ(E) is a direct summand of the Λ-module C(E,q); in particular, it is a saturated submodule. Let

[formula]

be the homomorphism of Λ-algebras that sends a∈C(E,q) to the endomorphism x  ↦  ax. Since 1∈C(E,q), the homomorphism [formula] is injective. In particular, the Λ-algebras C(E,q) and [formula] are isomorphic.

We claim that [formula] is a saturated Λ-submodule of [formula]. Taking into account that ϱ(E) is saturated in C(E,q), it is enough to show that [formula] is saturated in [formula]. Indeed, if a∈C(E,q) is such that [formula] is a divisible element in [formula], then [formula] is divisible in C(E,q) for all x∈C(E,q). In particular, if we put x = 1, then we see that [formula] is divisible in C(E,q). This proves our claim.

Now let [formula] and let [formula] be a free [formula]-module of finite rank with a non-degenerate quadratic form [formula]. Let [formula] be the group of automorphisms of the [formula]-algebra [formula]. If there is a continuous [formula]-adic representation [formula] that preserves [formula], then, by a universal property of Clifford algebras, there is a representation

[formula]

such that for any [formula] and any [formula] we have [formula]. Using [\cite=Bourbaki] one easily checks that [formula] is continuous.

Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield. Let P be an infinite set of primes not containing [formula]. Assume that for each [formula] we are given a free [formula]-module [formula] with a non-degenerate quadratic form [formula] and a continuous [formula]-adic representation [formula] preserving [formula].

Suppose that there is an abelian variety A over a finite separable field extension k' of k, and for each prime [formula] there is an isomorphism of [formula]-modules [formula] such that the composition of injective maps of [formula]-modules

[formula]

is a homomorphism of [formula]-modules.

Then the [formula]-module [formula] is semisimple for each [formula], and the [formula]-module [formula] is semisimple for all but finitely many [formula].

Replacing k' by its normal closure over k, we can assume that k' is a finite Galois extension of k, so that [formula] is an (open) normal subgroup of index

[formula]

((A, Z) )/=((A, F)).

[formula]

((A, Z) ) Q=((A, Q)).

[formula]

, the semisimplicity of the [formula]-module [formula] follows from the semisimplicity of the [formula]-module [formula].

We finish this section with the following complement to Proposition [\ref=semisimplek].

In the assumptions of Proposition [\ref=semisimplek] suppose that for each prime [formula] we have a [formula]-submodule [formula] of [formula] such that [formula] is saturated in [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] for all but finitely many [formula].

Since [formula] is saturated in [formula] and [formula] is saturated in [formula], we see that [formula] is a saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula]. It is [formula]-stable and isomorphic to [formula] as a Galois module. The proposition now follows from Corollary [\ref=techCOH].

K3 surfaces

Let k be a field of odd characteristic p that is finitely generated over [formula]. Let X be a K3 surface over k. Then

(i) for any prime [formula] the [formula]-modules [formula] and [formula] are semisimple;

(ii) for all but finitely many primes [formula] the [formula]-modules [formula] and [formula] are semisimple;

(iii) for all but finitely many primes [formula] we have [formula].

Choose a polarisation

[formula]

By the adjunction formula the degree of ξ is even, so that [formula], where d is a positive integer.

Let [formula] be the orthogonal complement to ξ in [formula] with respect to [formula]. Clearly, [formula] is a Galois-stable saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula]. We have

[formula]

and the direct sum [formula] is a subgroup of index 2d in [formula]. Furthermore, if [formula] does not divide 2d, then

[formula]

and the restriction

[formula]

is a perfect Galois-invariant pairing.

By a theorem of K. Madapusi Pera [\cite=Pera] the family of [formula]-adic representations [formula] preserving the quadratic form [formula], where [formula] is a prime not equal to p, satisfies the assumption of Proposition [\ref=semisimplek]. It follows that the [formula]-module

[formula]

is semisimple for each [formula]. This implies that the [formula]-module

[formula]

is semisimple, and hence so is its [formula]-submodule [formula], so (i) is proved.

Suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] be the image of ξ in

[formula]

From (2) we obtain a direct sum decomposition of [formula]-modules

[formula]

where [formula] is [formula]-invariant. By Proposition [\ref=semisimplek] the [formula]-module [formula] is semisimple for all but finitely many primes [formula]. Hence [formula] is semisimple too. Since [formula] is a Galois-stable saturated [formula]-submodule of [formula], the [formula]-module [formula] is isomorphic to a submodule of [formula]. This proves (ii).

Part (iii) follows from Proposition [\ref=add] applied to the family of [formula]-submodules

[formula]

for all [formula]. Indeed, by the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces over finitely generated fields of odd characteristic, proved by Madapusi Pera [\cite=Pera] (see also [\cite=Maulik] and [\cite=Charles]), we have [formula] for any finite separable field extension k' of k.

The first statement is already proved in Theorem [\ref=finiteK3] (ii). As recalled in the introduction, for all but finitely many primes [formula] we have a direct sum decomposition of [formula]-modules

[formula]

For these primes [formula] the Galois module [formula] is isomorphic to the direct sum of [formula] and [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=finiteK3] (iii), for all but finitely many [formula] we have [formula]. This implies

[formula]

The cokernel of the natural map [formula] is a subgroup of the Galois cohomology group [formula]. This group is finite, since [formula] is a free abelian group of finite rank. Removing the primes that divide the order of [formula] we see that the natural map

[formula]

is surjective for all but finitely many primes [formula].

The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence

[formula]

gives rise to the well known filtration [formula], where [formula] is the image of the natural map [formula] and [formula] is the kernel of the natural map [formula]. The spectral sequence shows that [formula] is contained in the finite group [formula], and [formula] is contained in [formula]. Hence it is enough to prove that [formula] is finite.

For a prime [formula] the Kummer exact sequence gives rise to the following exact sequence of [formula]-modules [\cite=SZ]:

[formula]

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=tatefiniteK3] we have seen that for all but finitely many primes [formula] the Galois module [formula] is a direct summand of [formula], and the second arrow in the displayed exact sequence is an isomorphism. It follows that [formula] for all but finitely many [formula].

To finish the proof we note that for any prime [formula] the [formula]-primary subgroup [formula] is finite. This follows from [\cite=SZ] in view of the semisimlicity of [formula], proved in Theorem [\ref=finiteK3] (i), and the Tate conjecture

[formula]

proved by Madapusi Pera [\cite=Pera] for any field k of odd characteristic p finitely generated over [formula].
