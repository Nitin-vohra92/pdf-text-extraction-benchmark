Comparison of T1 conditions for multiparameter operators

Introduction

Journé proved in [\cite=J] the T(1) Theorem for Calderón-Zygmund operators on product spaces. In that paper, Journé was able to formulate the statement of the theorem in a way that a priori resembles the classical one by using vector valued Calderón-Zygmund theory formulation. Once we analyse more closely this formulation, a priori boundedness of some components of the operator is required, which differs from the classical setting. This variance comes from trying to overcome some challenges that are not encountered in the classical case as, for example, that the singularities of multiparameter operators lie not only at the origin (as is the case of standard Calderón-Zygmund kernels), but they spread over larger subspaces. Pott and Villarroya [\cite=PV] modified the formulation so that no a priori boundedness is assumed in the operator.

The relationship between these two classes of operators defined from the different formulations was unclear. In this paper we prove that for L2 bounded operators the two sets of conditions actually define the same class of operators.

The main result of the paper reads as follows:

Let [formula] be a continuous linear mapping (n + m = d) that has the kernel representation

If T can be extended to a bounded operator T:L2  →  L2 then it satifies the Journé type conditions, i.e, T is a bi-parameter δ-SIO as defined in Definition [\ref=deltasio] satisfying the weak boundedness property [\eqref=classWBP] if and only if it satisfies the Pott-Villarroya type conditions, i.e., T is an operator defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] whose kernel satisfies [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1] and, additionally, T also satisfies [\eqref=mixedwbp]-[\eqref=diagbmo4] .

One of the reasons that leaded to compare both formulations is that Journé proved that for L2 bounded operators T that satisfy the Journé type conditions imply that T1, T*1∈BMO, while this was previously not known for the Pott-Villarroya type conditions. Thus, for the new product T1 theorems, the T1, T*1∈BMO conditions were just sufficient, but they were not known to be necessary. Moreover, with the equivalence of the Journé type and Pott-Villarroya type conditions, we indirectly find that T1, T*1∈BMO also for the L2 bounded operators T that satisfy the Pott-Villarroya type conditions.

We want to stress out that even when the two sets of conditions are now found to be equivalent, the new Pott-Villarroya type of conditions are still useful, since it may be easier to verify them in concrete cases than the vector-valued Journé type of conditions.

The layout of the paper is as follows. We are going to state the classical result and conditions as in [\cite=J] in Section [\ref=s2] while we will introduce the new mixed type conditions as they were defined in [\cite=M] in Section [\ref=s3]. Then we will proceed to prove the relation of such conditions in Sections [\ref=s4] and [\ref=s5]. Acknowledgements.- We would like to thank prof.

Classical formulation

In this section we are going to introduce the classical formulation as stated in Journé's original paper.

Let [formula], where Δ  =  {(x,y), x = y} and let δ∈(0,1).

Let K be a continuous function defined on Ω and taking its values in a Banach space B. The function K is a B - δ-standard kernel if the following are satisfied, for some constant C > 0.

For all (x,y)∈Ω,

[formula]

For all (x,y)∈Ω, and [formula] such that [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

The smallest constant C for which [\eqref=classicalsize], [\eqref=classcancel1] and [\eqref=classcancel2] hold is denoted by |K|δ,B. If the Banach space is the complex plane [formula] we will omit the subscript B for simplicity.

Let [formula] be a continuous linear mapping. T is a singular integral operator (SIO) if, for some, δ∈(0,1), there exists a [formula]-δ-standard kernel K such that for all functions [formula] having disjoints supports

We shall say that T is a δ-SIO.

Let T be a δ-SIO and K its kernel. We say that T is a δ- Calderón-Zygmund operator (δ-CZO) if it extends boundedly from L2 to itself. We also define the norm ||  ·  ||δCZ by

[formula]

Note that the defined norm makes the set of δ-CZO's a Banach space which we denote by δCZ.

To avoid excessive complication on notation we shall write |T|δ  =  |K|δ where by K we mean the kernel of T.

[\cite=J] Let [formula] be a continuous linear mapping. It is a bi-parameter δ-SIO on [formula] if there exists a pair (K1,K2) of δCZ-δ-standard kernels so that, for all [formula] and [formula], with [formula] (i = 1,2),

[formula]

[formula]

Let T̃ be defined by

[formula]

It is readly seen that T̃ is a bi-parameter δ-SIO if T is. Its kernels 1 and 2 will be given by 1(x,y) = K1(y,x) and [formula]

Furthermore, let us introduce some notation for simplicity purposes. We define the operator [formula] by

[formula]

It is easy to check that 〈g1,T1f1〉 is a δ-SIO on [formula] with kernel

[formula]

One defines K2f2,g2: = 〈g2,T2f2〉 in a similar manner.

Let T be a bi-paramenter δ - SIO on [formula]. We say it has the bi-parameter weak boundedness property (WBP) in the classical sense if for any bounded subset B of [formula] there exists a positive constant C (depending in the bounded subset) such that for any pair (η,ξ)∈B  ×  B, any [formula], t > 0 and i∈{1,2},

[formula]

where [formula] (ξxit defined similarly), d1 = n, d2 = m and Ti defined as above.

Mixed type conditions formulation

In this section we are going to introduce the mixed type conditions formulation introduced by Pott and Villarroya [\cite=PV] as reformulated by Martikainen [\cite=M].

We say that a function uV is V-adapted with zero mean if it satisfies supp(uV)  ⊂  V, |uV|  ≤  1 and [formula].

Let [formula] be a continuous linear mapping (n + m = d). Let [formula] and [formula] with [formula], [formula] satisfying [formula] for i∈{1,2}. We denote [formula] (meaning f(x) = f1(x1)  ·  f2(x2) for x = (x1,x2)) and [formula].

We say that T has a Calderón-Zygmund structure if it has the kernel representation

[formula]

where the kernel [formula] is assumed to satisfy the following conditions:

Size condition

[formula]

Aditionally, when |xi - xi'|  ≤  |xi - yi| / 2 and |yi - yi'|  ≤  |xi - yi| / 2 i = 1,2

[formula]

where i = 1,2 , j = 1,2, d1 = n, d2 = m. Morever for all cubes [formula]

[formula]

whenever uV is a V-adapted with zero mean.

Here Kjfj,gj is defined as in [\eqref=intermediatekernel].

Let T be an operator defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] whose kernel satisfies conditions [\eqref=sep1]-[\eqref=adapted1] then for all cubes [formula]

[formula]

whenever gV∈L∞(V), d1 = n, d2 = m.

Let gV∈L∞(V) and rewrite it as follows

[formula]

It is trivial to check that [formula] is V-adapted with zero mean and g2V is a constant between 0 and ||gV||∞ multiplying the characteristic function restricted to V so by linearity and [\eqref=adapted1]

[formula]

By symmetry we get the C(gV,χV)  ≤  C max(1,||gV||∞) |V|.

We say that T satisfies the weak boundedness property in the mixed type sense if for every [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

To avoid confusion with the WBP in the classical sense defined in [\eqref=classWBP] we are going to refer to [\eqref=mixedwbp] as mixed WBP.

We say that T satisfies diagonal BMO conditions if for every cube [formula] and [formula] and for every zero-mean functions aQ,bV wich are Q and V adapted respectively:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Mixed type conditions imply classical conditions

To prove that an operator T that satisfies the mixed type conditions introduced in Section [\ref=s3] is a bi-parameter δ-SIO on [formula] as defined in Section [\ref=s2] we first need to find a pair of δCZ-δ-standard kernels satisfying conditions [\eqref=defK1] and [\eqref=defK2]. Afterwards we are going to prove that if such δ-SIO defines an L2 bounded operator, it also satisfies the bi-parameter WBP [\eqref=classWBP] in the classical sense. First of all we are going to recall the following version of the uniparametric T(1) Theorem.

[\cite=Ho] Let T be a δ-SIO on [formula] and K its kernel. If there exists a constant A > 0 such that for every cube [formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then T is a bounded operator on L2 such that ||T||2  →  2  ≤  Cδ,d  ·  (A + |K|δ).

This version of the T1 theorem is not as well known as some others but follows, by a standard localization argument, from the classical versions.

Let T be an operator defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] whose kernel satisfies the conditions [\eqref=size] - [\eqref=adapted1] , then the pair is a pair of δCZ-δ- standard kernels satisfying conditions [\eqref=defK1] and [\eqref=defK2].

That the pair of kernels satisfy conditions [\eqref=defK1] and [\eqref=defK2] can be deduced from [\eqref=defmixoperator] and Fubini so we are going to concentrate on proving that K1 is a δCZ-δ- standard kernel and by the symmetry of the conditions we will also have that K2 is δCZ-δ- standard kernel.

Let's remind ourselves that for K1 to be a δCZ-δ- standard kernel, it needs to satisfy the size condition [\eqref=classicalsize] and the cancellation conditions [\eqref=classcancel1] and [\eqref=classcancel2] where |  ·  |B  =  ||  ·  ||δCZ. This means that the kernel of K1 (which is K(x1,y1)(x2,x2) =  K((x1,x2),(y1,y2)) = K(x,y) where the variables x1 and y1 are fixed) has to satisfy the aforementioned conditions with |  ·  |B being the absolute value and as an operator to be bounded in L2 as operator. Let's do this step by step

We prove that [formula]

It's immediate that [formula] by [\eqref=size], [\eqref=mixed3] and [\eqref=mixed4].

We prove that [formula]

The L2 boundedness is going to be a consequence of applying Theorem [\ref=1auxT1], which means that by duality, we need to prove that

for all gV∈L∞(V) such that ||gV||∞  ≤  1.

Then by linearity, [\eqref=sep1] and lemma [\ref=genadapted1]

[formula]

We prove that [formula]

[formula] by [\eqref=mixed1], [\eqref=holder2] and [\eqref=holder4].

[formula] which is satisfied by reasoning as in the first case using [\eqref=sep2] instead of [\eqref=sep1].

We prove that [formula]

[formula] by [\eqref=mixed2], [\eqref=holder3] and [\eqref=holder1].

[formula] which is satisfied by reasoning as in the first case using [\eqref=sep3] instead of [\eqref=sep1].

Let T be an operator defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] that can be extended to an L2 to L2 bounded bi-parameter operator and whose kernel satisfies [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1]. Then T satisfies the bi-parameter WBP [\eqref=classWBP] in the classical sense.

We are going to assume without loss of generality that i = 1 since by symmetry of the conditions the other case is proved in the same manner. Let's fix a bounded subset B of [formula]. Then there exists a constant CB such that ||f||2  ≤  CB [formula].

By definition, we need to prove that [formula]. Remember that in [\eqref=intermediatekernel] we determined that

[formula]

First of all we are going to prove that [formula] by using the proof of Proposition [\ref=mixedtoclassy] where we determined the L2 boundedness of K1(x1,y1) and K2(x2,y2) as well as their Hölder versions.

We prove that [formula]

[formula]

Similarly we prove that |〈ηx1tT1ξx1t〉(x2,y2)  -  〈ηx1tT1ξx1t〉(x2',y2)|

[formula]

[formula]

By a symmetric argument we have [formula]

Now we are left to prove that [formula].

Since we have proven that K1ξx1t,ηx1t has a δ-standard kernel we are in the conditions of using Theorem [\ref=1auxT1] to determine the L2 boundedness bound, i.e., by duality we are reduced to prove that

[formula]

for all cubes V in [formula] and all fV∈L∞(V) such that ||fV||∞  ≤  1 which is satisfied by the L2 to L2 boundedness of the operator which ends our proof.

We haven't included conditions [\eqref=mixedwbp] - [\eqref=diagbmo4] in the statement of the proof because they are a consequence of the L2 to L2 boundedness of the operator.

On [\cite=HyM2], it was stated that if an operator T defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] satisfied conditions [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1], [\eqref=mixedwbp]-[\eqref=diagbmo4] and T1, T*1, T̃1 and T̃*1 lie in BMO then the operator T could be extended to an L2 to L2 bounded operator.

It was also stated that if T is a bi-parameter δ - SIO that can be extended to an L2 to L2 bounded operator then T1 and T*1 lie in BMO. If in addition T̃ can be extended to an L2 to L2 bounded operator T̃1 and T̃*1 lie in BMO also.

It was missing, and we have just proven, it's that if T is an operator defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] that satisfies conditions [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1] and can be extended to an L2 to L2 bounded operator then T is a bi-parameter δ - SIO.

As a consequence we can answer the following open question left in [\cite=PV] and [\cite=HyM2].

Let T be an operator defined as in [\eqref=defmixoperator] that can be extended to an L2 to L2 bounded bi-parameter operator and whose kernel satisfies [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1]. Then T1 and T*1 lie in BMO and it has the WBP in the classical sense.

Classical conditions imply mixed type conditions

We have proven that the mixed type conditions imply the classical conditions, so in this section we are going to proceed to prove the converse direction, i.e., that the classical conditions imply the mixed type conditions.

Let T be a bi-parameter δ-SIO as defined in Definition [\ref=deltasio] satisfying the WBP [\eqref=classWBP], then T satisfies conditions [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1]. If in addition the operator is L2 to L2 bounded, then it also satisfies conditions [\eqref=mixedwbp]-[\eqref=diagbmo4].

That the operator satisfies [\eqref=size]-[\eqref=adapted1] can be deduced directly from the definition of δ-Calderón-Zygmund kernel. The size condition, Hölder conditions and mixed Hölder and size conditions ([\eqref=size]-[\eqref=mixed4]) are consequence of the pointwise conditions of the kernel while the separated Hölder and size conditions ([\eqref=sep1]-[\eqref=adapted1]) are consequence of the L2 boundedness conditions of the kernels with constant C(fj,gj)  ≤  C||fj||2  ·  ||gj||2 for j = 1,2.

Finally, that the operator satisfies conditions [\eqref=mixedwbp]-[\eqref=diagbmo4] is a trivial consequence of the L2 boundedness of the operator.

It is worth noticing that Pott and Villarroya original conditions differs slightly from the mixed type conditions that we have used in this paper. While we have used characteristic function and cube adapted functions in conditions [\eqref=adapted1]-[\eqref=diagbmo4], they used instead some bump functions which has not necessarily compact support.

That the above result can also be proven for the [\cite=PV] conditions it is left for the reader. We would like to point out that in the uniparametric setting, we can indiscriminately test our operator on characteristic functions or in bump functions (c.f. [\cite=G]). If we add that observation with the fact that we have used uniparametric results along the proofs of this paper, one can get an idea of the blueprint for proving such results for the [\cite=PV] conditions.
