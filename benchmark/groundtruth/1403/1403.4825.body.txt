Pattern formation during the oscillatory photoelectrodissolution of n-type silicon: Turbulence, clusters and chimeras

Introduction

Coupled oscillations are encountered in many contexts in nature and technology. Their prevalence spans over such diverse fields as pacemaker cells in the heart muscle [\cite=Cherry:2008], neural activity in the brain [\cite=Izhikevich:2000], long term climate patterns [\cite=Mann:1995] or the electrical power grid [\cite=Rohden:2012]. All such systems have in common that their dynamical behavior results from the interaction between a local oscillation and the coupling between the individual oscillators. Thus, the dynamics depends on generic properties of the oscillations such as their harmonical or relaxational character and the way they interact with each other, which might be local (diffusive), long-range or global [\cite=Kuramoto:1984]. Therefore, the study of a specific system yields also universal information of spatio-temporal organization of other oscillatory systems [\cite=Cross:1993]. In this context, we study an electrochemical oscillatory medium, the photoelectrodissolution of n-doped silicon, with a spatial coupling that produces novel types of synchronization patterns. Our work ties in with previous studies of oscillatory media in chemical and physical systems. Best known are the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and the oxidation of CO on Pt in UHV [\cite=Zaikin:1970] [\cite=Epstein:1996] [\cite=Jakubith:1990] [\cite=Ertl:1991], which proved to be prototypical systems with diffusive coupling, exhibiting a variety of dynamically different states, such as sprial waves and chemical turbulence. In addition to the diffusive, i.e. local, coupling, there are many physical mechanisms leading to a long-range or even global coupling of the oscillators. This applies, e.g., to electrically controlled systems, such as semiconductor devices [\cite=Meixner:2000] [\cite=Scholl:2001], gas discharge tubes [\cite=Purwins:2010] or electrochemical systems [\cite=Mazouz:1997] [\cite=Christoph:2002] [\cite=Krischer:2003] [\cite=Varela:2005]. The most prominent patterns emerging from a global coupling are scale free cluster patterns where the medium separates into a few domains, oscillating with a certain, constant phase lag [\cite=Falcke:1995] [\cite=Vanag:2000] [\cite=Wang:2000] [\cite=Bertram:2003] [\cite=Varela:20052]. In parallel to these experimental works, theoretical studies employing the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) or phase oscillator models as universal descriptions of oscillatory systems were carried out [\cite=Pikovsky:2001] [\cite=Aranson:2002]. The former is a normal form equation of an oscillatory medium close to the Hopf bifurcation where the limit cycles are only weakly attractive, while the latter captures the dynamics of strongly attractive, coupled limit cycles. Among the vast literature on the solutions of these equations, cluster patterns are most relevant in the context of our work [\cite=Hakim:1992] [\cite=Okuda:1993]. Typically, one distinguishes between phase clusters, where all oscillators follow the same limit cycle but form distinct groups with a constant phase difference, and amplitude clusters, where the different groups occupy different limit cycles with distinct amplitudes and phases. Both types of clusters emerge in globally coupled systems, however, phase clusters require coupling functions with higher harmonics. Thus, in contrast to amplitude clusters, they cannot be described in the framework of the CGLE with a linear global coupling. In our work we encounter cluster patterns with novel features, most remarkably self-organized chimera states and other types of coexistence of different dynamical states on the electrode surface, and we discuss that a nonlinear coupling leads to their emergence. Furthermore, a collection of other peculiar patterns and unusual synchronization phenomena is presented. Our experimental system is the photoelectrochemical oxidation of n-doped silicon to SiO2 under potentiostatic conditions and the concurrent dissolution of this oxide mediated by fluoride species. Owing to this interplay of oxidation and etching process the system exhibits oscillations in current and oxide layer thickness in a broad parameter regime [\cite=Turner:1958] [\cite=Gerischer:1988] [\cite=Zhang:2001]. The electrochemical oxidation equation reads:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the number of charge transfer processes via the valence band of the silicon, i.e., processes involving minority charge carriers in n-doped silicon. These holes drive the initial charge transfer step in equation [\ref=eq:OxReac], i.e., the inequality [formula] holds and there is no oxidation current without illumination [\cite=Hasegawa:1988]. A limited illumination and, therefore, limited generation rate of holes in the valence band of the working electrode thus introduces a cut-off for the total current. It constitutes a global constraint as well as a nonlinear coupling mechanism between the oscillating electrode positions. An additional, global coupling mechanism is introduced by connecting a resistance [formula] in series to the working electrode in the potentiostatically controlled experiments. This external resistance couples the voltage drop [formula] across the electrode|oxide|electrolyte interface at each individual point of the surface of the working electrode to the total current through the working electrode and the introduced coupling consequently has a linear characteristic.

[formula]

Here, U is the externally applied voltage, [formula] the spatial average of the current density and A the electrode area. In order to get a comprehensive picture of the dependence of the patterns on the experimental parameters, four of these parameters are varied over a wide range where current oscillations occur. Two of these parameters characterize the electrolyte, the first one being the total concentration of fluoride species [formula] and the second one the pH value which determines the distribution of the fluoride on the three species F-, HF and HF-2 according to the law of mass action. Both parameters together determine the total silicon oxide etching rate as the different fluoride species follow different etching pathways with distinct rates [\cite=Judge:1971] [\cite=Cattarin:2000]. The other two parameters represent the strengths of the coupling mechanisms given by the illumination intensity [formula] for the nonlinear coupling and [formula] for the purely linear global coupling, respectively. After a description of the experimental setup for the spatially resolved recording of the oxide layer with an ellipsometric imaging technique and the data processing in section [\ref=sec:Exp], an overview of the parameter dependence of the pattern forming regime is given and the patterns occurring in the experiments are classified by spatially averaged quantities. Subsequently, in sections [\ref=subsec:P1]-[\ref=subsec:Irreg] for each such class the different prototypic patterns encountered in the experiments are shown in a systematic way. Additionally, the requirements on a generic model exhibiting such spatio-temporal dynamics are discussed.

Experimental

The working electrodes are the (111) faces of monocrystalline, n-type doped silicon samples with a resistivity of 3 - 5 ~ Ωcm. They are ohmically back-contacted with a thermally evaporated 200 nm aluminum layer annealed at [formula]C for 15 minutes. The silicon is attached to a custom made PTFE holder via silicone paste (Scrintex 901, Ralicks GmbH, Rees-Haldern, Germany) which also serves as a sealing for the back-contact against the electrolyte. The typical electrode size is [formula] mm2. As a counter electrode, a circular shaped platinum wire is placed symmetrically in front of the working electrode and a saturated Hg|Hg2SO4 reference electrode is used which is placed behind the working electrode at a distance of several centimeters. During the experiments the electrolyte is constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer rotating at about 10 Hz. The sample illumination is realized by a He-Ne laser and the illumination intensity is adjusted by a polarizer plate. The laser beam is optically expanded to a diameter of ca. 1.5 cm and passes an iris diaphragm so that only its central part is incident on the sample to guarantee a spatially uniform illumination. For the ellipsometric imaging of the optical path through the oxide, light from a blue LED (λ = 470 nm) is first elliptically polarized by passing a linear polarizer and a zeroth order λ/4-plate. It then hits the sample surface at an angle close to the Brewster angle of the silicon|electrolyte system ([formula]). The reflected light passes another polarizer which converts changes in the polarization upon reflection caused by the optical path through the oxide into an intensity signal. Using a suitable lens, an image of this ellipsometric intensity distribution across the surface is then created on the CCD chip of a camera (JAI CV-A50). The data is then digitized using a frame grabber card (PCI-1405, National Instruments) and preprocessed and recorded by a Labview program. A sketch of the setup (with the optical components of the ellipsometric imaging path omitted) is shown in figure [\ref=fig:Sketch]. Before the experiments the silicon working electrodes are cleaned by first rubbing them carefully with an acetone soaked tissue and subsequently immersing them in acetone (p.a.), ethanol (p.a.), methanol (p.a.) and ultrapure water for 5 min each. The electrolyte is always an aqueous solution of NH4F (Merck, p.a.) as a fluoride source and H2SO4 (Merck, Suprapur) to adjust the pH value. Prior to the experiments the electrolyte is bubbled with argon and an argon atmosphere is retained during the experiments. All experiments are potentiostatically controlled (Potentiostat: FHI-2740, electronics laboratory of the Fritz-Haber- Institut, Berlin, Germany). A constant voltage of 8.65 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode is applied between the reference and the working electrode with a tunable ohmic resistance connected in series to the working electrode. For the analysis of the patterns the spatial distribution of the ellipsometric intensity at specified points in time is considered as well as the ellipsometric signal of one dimensional subsets of the electrode over the entire time window. Furthermore, the time series of the ellipsometric intensity at each individual point is Fourier transformed (FFT, MATLAB) and the spatial distribution of absolute value and phase of relevant Fourier coefficients is then used to gain insight into phase clustering behavior for these Fourier modes. Lastly, the data from a selected area on the electrode is Hilbert transformed (MATLAB) and the resulting analytical signal, i.e. the complex signal with the original data as the real part and the Hilbert transform of the data as the imaginary part, is used to visualize the different dynamics on the electrode.

Results and Discussion

Overview

Simple periodic oscillations

Period-2 oscillations

Oscillations with an irregular amplitude

Exemplary time series for the three types of [formula] oscillations are shown in figure [\ref=fig:Classification]. In the case of simple periodic oscillations in [formula], 2d simulations using the suitably modified complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with a nonlinear global coupling show striking similarities with the patterns observed in the experiments [\cite=Miethe:2009] [\cite=Garcia-Morales:2010] [\cite=Schmidt:2014]. This opens a pathway to a possible deeper understanding of both the origin of the pattern formation and the coupling mechanism. Consequently, in the following the emphasis is first put on the analysis of the first class of patterns and the second and third class are treated as modifications of this first class and are discussed later.

Simple periodic oscillations in [formula]

In a first step we now consider the patterns forming during simple periodic [formula] oscillations depicted in the top of figure [\ref=fig:Classification]. The regularity of the spatially averaged signal implies that the spatial variations of the patterns cancel out on average. There are two dominant types of patterns forming. First, subharmonic phase clusters are found, where the ellipsometric intensity at each point shows oscillations with a strong frequency component at an integer fraction of the spatially averaged oscillation frequency. These points are arranged in phase domains where all points within a domain are synchronized and the distinct domains differ in their phase [\cite=Miethe:2009]. Typically but not exclusively, 2-phase clusters are found. The second type of dynamical behavior found are desynchronized oscillations with a broad distribution of oscillation frequencies. Hence, at any given point the oscillation amplitude is irregular. As already mentioned, typically the electrode forms different regions. In a region either one of the two patterns mentioned or a synchronized oscillation with the frequency of the spatially averaged signal exists. The occurrence of only one type of dynamical behavior on the entire electrode surface and any pairwise coexistence have been found in this study and are subsequently presented.

Period-2 oscillations in [formula]

A first deviation from the simple periodic oscillations in [formula] is the occurrence of period-2 oscillations in [formula] as shown in the middle of figure [\ref=fig:Classification]. In all experiments where this behavior is found it is accompanied by the formation of a 2-phase cluster region where one phase domain covers a larger area or has a higher amplitude in the subharmonic mode than the other. An example is shown in figure [\ref=fig:SHinAv]. In the distribution of amplitude and phase of the Fourier coefficient of the subharmonic mode in the lower images of figure [\ref=fig:SHinAv] c) the lack of balance between the phase domains of the 2-phase cluster becomes apparent. The difference between the unbalanced and the balanced case is visualized in figure [\ref=fig:Vergleich] by an overlay of the amplitude and phase plots of the Fourier coefficients of the subharmonic mode for the patterns shown in figures [\ref=fig:SHinAv] (unbalanced) and [\ref=fig:Hom+SH1] (balanced), respectively. While the two phase domains on the left hand side of the unbalanced electrode in figure [\ref=fig:Vergleich] are of similar size and the amplitude of the Fourier coefficient in these domains is similar, there is no counterbalancing phase domain for the domain in the upper right corner. For this reason the phase color coded as purple in figure [\ref=fig:SHinAv] c) is also visible as an amplitude variation in the spatially averaged ellipsometric intensity signal. Whenever the average signal [formula] of a patterned electrode oscillates with a period-2, unbalanced 2-phase clusters are present.

Irregular oscillations in [formula]

The last type of patterns discussed here occurs accompanied by an irregular oscillation of [formula] as shown in the bottom of figure [\ref=fig:Classification]. In this case three different pattern categories are distinguished. The first category, shown in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg1], can again be seen as a deviation from the case of simple periodic spatial average oscillations. Here the irregular oscillation of the spatial average is imposed on the entire electrode and the relative intensity of the maxima and minima of [formula] in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg1] a) can be traced in the synchronized region in the lower part of the one dimensional cut in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg1] b). A striking similarity between this type of pattern and the patterns forming accompanied by a simple periodic oscillation in [formula] is that the regions on the electrode retain their respective dynamical behaviors and sizes until the measurement is finished. Spatially uniform oscillations with an irregular amplitude are also encountered with p-type [\cite=Miethe:2012] [\cite=Schoenleber:2012] and highly illuminated n-type silicon samples, i.e., in the absence of the nonlinear coupling. For this reason the measurement shown in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg1] can be seen as a deviation from the 'chimera state' shown in figure [\ref=fig:Hom+Turb1]. The former is caused by the nonlinear coupling imposed on a spatially uniform oscillation with irregular, most likely chaotic, dynamics, while the latter is caused by the nonlinear coupling acting on a simple periodic, spatially uniform oscillation. The other two categories of patterns forming during oscillations of [formula] with an irregular amplitude are qualitatively different from all other types of patterns considered so far. The most important difference is that the regions spontaneously forming on the electrode, while still well distinguishable, show dynamical behavior varying with time. A first example of such spatio-temporal pattern formation is shown in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg2]. One important feature the spatio-temporal pattern shown in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg2] shares with all spatio-temporal patterns shown so far, is that the regions with distinct dynamical behavior do not change their shape as is well visible in the temporal evolution of the cross section in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg2] b). Conversely, the dynamical behavior in the region in the middle of the cross section changes significantly twice on a long time scale from a completely desynchronized oscillation pattern to a nearly synchronized oscillation pattern with a significantly lower amplitude and back. These profound changes in the overall behavior are also visible in the time series of [formula]. Another qualitatively different behavior where the walls of the regions themselves are moving is shown in figure [\ref=fig:Irreg3]. In this example the respective sizes of the two regions distinguishable on the electrode surface change as one region first grows at the expense of the other to completely vanish once it fills up the entire electrode. It is remarkable in this example how long the memory of the surface seems to be as the period of the growing process is about 30 times larger than the base oscillation period.

Summary and Conclusions

In this work, we presented a variety of self-organized spatio-temporal patterns forming in the ellipsometric intensity during the oscillatory photoelectrodissolution of n-type silicon under limited illumination. Remarkably, different regions of distinct dynamical behavior formed spontaneously under spatially uniform experimental parameters which were kept constant in time. We classified these patterns according to the behavior of the spatially averaged signal of the ellipsometric intensity [formula], the dominant case being a simple periodic oscillation of [formula]. In this case, the patterns included synchronized oscillations, subharmonic 2-phase clusters emerging from the uniform oscillation by a period doubling bifurcation and desynchronized oscillations. Any pairwise coexistence of such dynamical regions was found including so-called 'chimera states'. A short overview of the patterns is given in table 1. The conservation of the simple periodic oscillation of [formula] and j suggest the presence of a nonlinear global coupling. Indeed, the patterns only occur when the total coupling was found to be dominated by the nonlinear coupling imposed by the limited illumination. However, whether the coupling induced by the limited illumination of the sample is indeed global, remains an open question at this point. In addition to the case of simple periodic oscillations in [formula], patterns accompanied by period-2 and irregular oscillations in [formula] have been presented. In the former case, unbalanced 2-phase clusters were always present on the electrode, linking the period-2 oscillation of [formula] to the lack of phase balance. The latter case opens a wide variety of possible patterns which were classified by the stability of the region walls and their long term behavior but not yet studied in detail. The presented occurrence of patterns where different dynamical states coexist under completely uniform experimental parameters broadens the spectrum of self-organized patterns in oscillatory media. So far, mainly one particular state amongst these coexistence states, the 'chimera state', has received immense interest. Here, we demonstrate that this state is embedded in a series of related coexistence patterns, arguably showing a similar level of seemingly contradictory behavior in the coexisting regions. An example is the coexistence of a cluster and a desynchronized region shown in figure [\ref=fig:SH+Turb1]. The wide variety of such patterns in the presence of a simple periodic global oscillation is remarkable. This conserved oscillation of the spatially averaged quantities seems to strongly promote the spontaneous emergence of the coexistence of different dynamical states on the electrode. In a wider sense, this can be seen as diversification of the dynamical behavior of a system with uniform parameters. The essential dynamical features responsible for this behavior remain unclear at this point. Considering our experiments, the assumption of a nonlinear global coupling as a necessary ingredient seems to be justified when considering the minority charge carrier dynamics in the silicon electrode. The lifetime of these charge carriers is several orders of magnitude shorter than any characteristic time scale of the observed oscillatory dynamics while the diffusion length is comparable to the system size within one order of magnitude. This should bring about a long-range if not effectively global coupling. In conclusion, the novel type of spatio-temporal patterns presented here sheds light on a number of fundamental questions concerning universal laws of pattern formation in oscillatory media, inviting future studies in both experiment and theory.
