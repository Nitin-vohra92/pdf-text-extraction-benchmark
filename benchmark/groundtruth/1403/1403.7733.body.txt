Introduction

A biased graph Ω consists of a pair (G,B), where G is a graph and B is a collection of cycles of G, called balanced, obeying the theta property. A theta graph consists of a pair of distinct vertices and three internally disjoint paths between them; the theta property is the property that no theta subgraph contains exactly two balanced cycles. Cycles not in B are called unbalanced. We write Ω  =  (G,B) and say G is the underlying graph of Ω. Throughout graphs are finite, and may have loops and parallel edges.

Biased graphs were introduced by Zaslavsky in [\cite=Zaslavsky-I], and in [\cite=Zaslavsky-II] Zaslavsky defined a natural matroid with ground set the edges of a biased graph (G,B), which we may describe in terms of its circuits as follows. A set C  ⊆  E(G) is a circuit in this matroid if in (G,B), C induces one of: a balanced cycle, two edge-disjoint unbalanced cycles intersecting in only one vertex, two vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles along with a path connecting them, or a theta subgraph with all cycles unbalanced.

A matroid is frame if it may be extended such that it possesses a basis B0 (a frame) such that every element is spanned by at most two elements of B0. Zaslavsky [\cite=Zaslavsky-Frame] has shown that the class of frame matroids is precisely that of matroids arising from biased graphs as described above (whence these have also been called bias matroids). Given a biased graph Ω  =  (G,B) we denote by F(Ω) or F(G,B) the frame matroid arising from Ω. Observe that given a graph G, if B contains all cycles in G, then F(G,B) is the cycle matroid M(G) of G, and that [formula] is the bicircular matroid of G. Frame matroids also include Dowling geometries [\cite=Dowling] (see also, for example, [\cite=MR2459453] and [\cite=Zaslavsky-I]).

Whitney [\cite=Whitney33] characterised when two graphs give rise to the same graphic matroid, and Matthews [\cite=Matthews] characterized which graphs have isomorphic graphic bicircular matroids. To state Whitney's result we first need some definitions. Given a graph H and a set of edges Y, we let H|Y denote the subgraph of H with edge set Y and no isolated vertices. Let H be a graph, and let (X1,X2) be a partition of E(H) such that [formula]. We say that H' is obtained by a Whitney flip of H on {u1,u2} if H' is a graph obtained by identifying vertices u1,u2 of H|X1 with vertices u2,u1 of H|X2, respectively. A graph H' is 2-isomorphic to H if H' is obtained from H by a sequence of the operations: Whitney flips, identifying two vertices from distinct components of a graph, or partitioning a graph into components each of which is a block of the original graph.

Let G and H be graphs without isolated vertices. Then [formula] if and only if G and H are 2-isomorphic.

Six families of biased graphs whose frame matroids are graphic are defined and exhibited in Section [\ref=sec:SixFamilies]. A biased graph in any of these families is obtained from a graph G by a simple operation, and it is easily checked that the frame matroid arising from the resulting biased graph is isomorphic to the cycle matroid of G. For ease of reference, we name them: (1) balanced, (2) fat thetas, (3) curlings, (4) pinches, (5) 4-twistings, and (6) consecutive odd-twistings. We call the corresponding operation in each case by the same name. Our main result says that every graphic frame matroid comes from a biased graph in one of these families.

Let G be a 2-connected graph and Ω a biased graph with F(Ω)  =  M(G). Then there is a graph H 2-isomorphic to G such that either Ω is balanced with underlying graph H, or Ω is obtained from H as a fat theta, a curling, a pinch, a 4-twisting, or a consecutive odd-twisting.

Increasing the connectivity of the graph G in Theorem [\ref=2-con] reduces the possible biased graph representations of F(Ω). Asking that G be 3-connected removes one family from the list of possibilities, and simplifies the curling operation. The following is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=2-con].

Let G be a 3-connected graph with at least four vertices and Ω a biased graph with F(Ω) = M(G). Then either Ω is balanced with underlying graph G, or obtained from G as a simple curling, a pinch, a 4-twisting, or a consecutive odd-twisting.

If we further demand that G be 4-connected, we are still left with two possible families of biased graph representations. The following is an immediate consequence of Corollary [\ref=3-con].

Let G be a 4-connected graph with at least five vertices and Ω a biased graph with F(Ω) = M(G). Then either Ω is balanced with underlying graph G, or obtained from G as a simple curling or a pinch.

Finally, we note that for any k  ≥  4, if G is a k-connected graph on n vertices, then in general there may be up to [formula] non-isomorphic biased graphs Ω with F(Ω) isomorphic to M(G) (obtained as pinches and simple curlings of G). Corollary [\ref=4-con] says, however, that these will be all the biased graph representations of M(G).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First we exhibit the six families of biased graphs whose frame matroids are graphic (appearing in Theorem [\ref=2-con]). We then show that the frame matroids arising from these biased graphs are indeed graphic, and that every graphic frame matroid arises from a biased graph in one of these families.

Six families of biased graphs with graphic frame matroids

We now describe six families of biased graphs whose frame matroids are graphic. For any positive integer n, set [formula].

1. Balanced biased graphs.  Let Ω  =  (H,B) be a biased graph. If every cycle of H is in B, then Ω is balanced. Clearly, F(Ω)  =  M(H), so F(Ω) is graphic.

2. Fat thetas.  To describe our second family, let H1,H2,H3 be non-empty graphs with distinct vertices xi,yi∈V(Hi). Let H be obtained from H1,H2,H3 by identifying yi and xi + 1 to a vertex wi for every i∈[3] (where the indices are modulo 3; see the left of Figure [\ref=fig:fat_theta]). Let Ω = (Γ,B) be a biased graph, where Γ is obtained from H1,H2,H3 by identifying x1,x2,x3 to a vertex x and identifying y1,y2,y3 to a vertex y. A cycle of Γ is in B if and only if E(C) is completely contained in one of H1,H2 or H3 (see the right of Figure [\ref=fig:fat_theta]). Then we say that Ω is a fat theta obtained from H.

A biased graph Ω is a signed graph if its edges can be labelled by 1 or - 1 such that a cycle C is balanced in Ω if and only if E(C) contains an even number of edges labelled - 1. In all figures of signed graphs we adopt the following convention. A shaded area around a vertex denotes that all the edges in that area incident with that vertex are labelled with - 1. Bold edges are also labelled - 1. All unmarked edges are labelled 1.

3. Curlings.  Let H be a 2-connected graph, v∈V(H), and suppose that there are distinct vertices [formula] and connected subgraphs [formula] of H such that [formula]. Suppose moreover that every edge incident with v is contained in some Hi. Let Ω be the signed graph obtained from H by first labeling all edges incident with v by - 1 and then changing any such edge e = uv to uvi when u∈Hi (if u = vi this produces a loop at vi), and keeping all other edges not incident with v unchanged and labelled by 1 (see Figure [\ref=fig:curling]). Then we say that Ω is a curling of H. If, for every i, every edge in Hi is between v and vi then we call Ω a simple curling.

4. Pinches.  If Ω is obtained from H by identifying two vertices v1 and v2 to a new vertex v and labeling all edges incident with v1 by - 1 and all other edges by 1, then we say Ω is a pinch. An edge with endpoints v1,v2 becomes an unbalanced loop incident to v (Figure [\ref=fig:A_pinch]).

5. 4-twistings.  Let H1,H2,H3,H4 be graphs (not necessarily all non-empty) with distinct vertices xi,yi,zi∈V(Hi). Let H be obtained from H1,H2,H3,H4 by identifying xi,y3 - i,zi + 2 to a vertex wi for every i∈[4] (where the indices are modulo 4). Let Ω be a signed graph obtained from H1,H2,H3,H4 by identifying x1, x2,x3,x4 to a vertex x, identifying y1,y2,y3,y4 to a vertex y and identifying z1,z2,z3,z4 to a vertex z, and with all edges originally incident with x1,y2 or z3 labelled by - 1 and all other edges labelled by 1 (see Figure [\ref=fig:fourtwisting]). Then we say that Ω is a 4-twisting of H.

6. Consecutive odd-twistings.  Let [formula] (for k  ≥  3), be graphs with distinct vertices xi,yi,zi∈V(Hi) for i∈[k]. Let H be a graph obtained from [formula] by identifying [formula] to a vertex z and for each i∈[k] identifying yi - 1 and xi to a vertex wi (where the indices are modulo k). Let Ω be the signed graph obtained from [formula] by identifying yi - 1,zi,xi + 1 to a vertex ui for every i∈[k] (where the indices are modulo k), and with all edges originally incident with y1 or x2 labelled by - 1 and all other edges labelled by 1 (see Figure [\ref=fig:cons-twisting]). Then we say that Ω is a consecutive twisting of H. If k is odd then Ω is a consecutive odd-twisting of H.

All graphic frame matroids arise from these six families

In preparation for the proof of our main result, we now introduce some notation. Let H be a graph and X  ⊆  V(H). We say X is a vertex-cut of H if [formula] has at least one more component than H. When |X| = 1, we also say X is a cut-vertex of H. A block of H is a maximal connected subgraph which has no cut-vertex. An end-block is a block containing at most one cut-vertex.

In the rest of the paper, let G be a 2-connected graph and let Ω be a biased graph with F(Ω) = M(G). We let Γ denote the underlying graph of Ω and E = E(Γ).

A handcuff consists of a pair of cycles C1 and C2, and a path P connecting C1 and C2 such that P meets Ci at ui and nowhere else and C1 meets C2 only at [formula]. If u1  ≠  u2 then the handcuff is loose; otherwise it is tight. A subgraph or edge set of Ω is balanced if each cycle in it is balanced; otherwise it is unbalanced. Moreover, it is contra-balanced if it has no balanced cycles. A vertex v of a biased graph Ω is a blocking vertex if [formula] is balanced.

Zaslavsky has characterized those biased graphs Ω for which F(Ω) is binary.

Let Ω be a biased graph. Then F(Ω) is binary if and only if each connected component of Ω has one of the following forms.

It is balanced.

It is a fat theta.

It is a signed graph with more than one unbalanced block, and each unbalanced block Bi has a vertex vi such that [formula] is balanced and vi is a cut-vertex separating Bi from all other unbalanced blocks.

It is a signed graph with just one unbalanced block, and has no two vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles.

Therefore, any biased graph Ω with graphic frame matroid has one of the forms (1)-(4) of Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky]. Evidently, when Ω is balanced, by Whitneys 2-Isomorphism Theorem Γ is 2-isomorphic to G. That is, when Ω has the form in Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](1), Ω is balanced with underlying graph Γ 2-isomorphic to G. Next we consider a biased graph Ω that has one of forms (2)-(4) of Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky].

First we consider an Ω that has form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](2). Assume that Ω is a fat theta obtained from balanced graphs Ω1,Ω2,Ω3 by identifying u1,u2,u3 to a vertex u and v1,v2,v3 to a vertex v, where ui,vi∈V(Γi) (where Γi is the underlying graph of Ωi). Let H be the graph obtained from Γ1,Γ2,Γ3 by identifying ui with vi + 1 for any i∈[3], where the subscripts are modulo 3. Evidently, M(H) = F(Ω); and consequently, by Whitney's 2-Isomorphism Theorem H is 2-isomorphic to G as F(Ω) = M(G) implying M(H) = M(G). So we only need to consider Ω with forms (3) and (4) of Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky]. These cases will be discussed in Sections [\ref=sec:form_Zas_3] and [\ref=sec:form_Zas_4] respectively. We end this section with two results that will be used without reference sometimes. The first one appears in [\cite=Zaslavsky81].

A biased graph is a signed graph if and only if it has no contra-balanced theta subgraphs.

The last result of this section is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky] and Lemma [\ref=notheta].

Let Ω be an unbalanced signed graph such that F(Ω) is a connected binary matroid. Then Ω has no balanced loops and at least one of the following holds.

Ω consists of one unbalanced block.

Ω has more than one unbalanced blocks and a block is unbalanced if and only if it is an end-block. Moreover, when F(Ω) is 3-connected, each unbalanced block is an unbalanced loop.

Ω with form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](3)

In this section, we mainly characterize those signed graphs Ω representing the 2-connected graph G with form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](3), that is, Ω is a signed graph with more than one unbalanced block, and each unbalanced block Bi has a vertex vi such that [formula] is balanced and vi is a cut-vertex separating Bi from all other unbalanced blocks. It follows from Corollary [\ref=type-2-con] that a block is unbalanced if and only if it is an end-block.

First we show that when Ω is a curling, F(Ω) is graphic.

Let Ω be a curling of H defined as Section [\ref=sec:SixFamilies]. Then M(H) = F(Ω).

Let C be an arbitrary cycle of H. When v∉C, the set C is also a balanced cycle of H. So we may assume v∈C and e1 = vu1,e2 = vu2∈C. When u1,u2 are in the same Hi, C is also a balanced cycle of Ω; otherwise, C is a contra-balanced handcuff of Ω. Therefore, every circuit of M(H) is a circuit of F(Ω).

On the other hand, let C be an arbitrary circuit of F(Ω). Evidently, C is a balanced cycle or a contra-balanced handcuff of Ω as Ω is a signed graph with no contra-balanced theta subgraph. In either case, by the definition of Ω, it is easy to verify that C is a cycle of H. Hence, every circuit of F(Ω) is a circuit of M(H).

Secondly, we show that when Ω is a biased graph representing M(G) with more than one unbalanced block, there is a graph H 2-isomorphic to G such that Ω is obtained as a curling of H. To prove this we need some definitions and results first.

Assume that Ω is a signed graph, and (V1,V2) is an arbitrary partition of V. Let δ = (V1,1;V2, - 1) be a labeling of V such that any vertex in V1 is labelled by 1 and any vertex in V2 labelled by - 1. Then δ(Ω) is a switching of Ω with any edge relabelled by the product of its end-vertices' labeling and its original labeling in Ω. Evidently, F(Ω) = F(δ(Ω)).

Let Ω be a balanced signed graph. Then by switching all edges of Ω can be labelled by 1.

It suffices to show that the result holds when Γ is connected. Let T be a spanning tree of Γ. Then for some switching δ(Ω), every edge of T is labelled by 1. For every edge e not in T, the unique cycle in [formula] is balanced, thus e is also labelled with 1 in δ(Ω). It follows that all edges in δ(Ω) are labelled by 1.

Let G be a 2-connected graph and Ω be an unbalanced signed graph with a blocking vertex v and satisfying F(Ω) = M(G). Then there is a graph H 2-isomorphic to G such that Ω is obtained from H by a pinch.

By Lemma [\ref=sign-bal], it is easy to see that by some switching we can assume that all edges of Ω labelled by - 1 are incident with v. Moreover, since Ω is unbalanced, some edges incident with v are labelled by 1 and some edges incident with v are labelled by - 1. Let H be the graph obtained from Ω by splitting v into v1 and v2 such that any edge e = vu labelled by - 1 is changed to e = v1u and any edge e = vu labelled by 1 is changed to e = v2u and with all other edges not incident with v unchanged. Every unbalanced loop at v becomes a v1v2 edge. Evidently, F(Ω) = M(H); and hence, H 2-isomorphic to G as F(Ω) = M(G).

A graph H is a path graph if H is connected and its blocks-cut-vertices graph is a path. The proof of Lemma [\ref=with-a-bal-vertex] is similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=a-bal-vertex-case].

Let Ω be an unbalanced signed graph with a blocking vertex v. Then there is a graph H with F(Ω) = M(H) and such that Γ is obtained by identifying two vertices v1 and v2 of H to v. Moreover, if Γ is 2-connected and H is a path graph that is not 2-connected, then each end-block contains exactly one of v1 and v2.

For a path graph H, arbitrarily choose two vertices v1,v2 from its end-blocks such that when H is not 2-connected neither v1 nor v2 is a cut-vertex of H and they are not in the same end-block. Add an edge e connecting v1 and v2 to obtain a new graph H1. Let H1' be a graph 2-isomorphic to H1 and v1',v2' be the end-vertices of e in H1'. Evidently, graph H' = H1' - e is 2-isomorphic to H and any v1v2-path in H is changed to a v1'v2'-path in H' although the order of edges may be different. In this case we say that H' is a path graph 2-isomorphic to H with v1v2-paths changed to v1'v2'-paths.

Let Ω be a signed graph with Γ connected and such that a block is unbalanced if and only if it is an end-block. Assume each unbalanced block Bi has a vertex vi such that [formula] is balanced and vi is a cut-vertex separating Bi from all other unbalanced blocks. Let [formula] be all end-blocks of Ω and for each i∈[k] set Ei = E(Bi),Γi  =  Γ|Ei. Then the following hold.

For some switch δ(Ω), every edge labelled by - 1 is in some Bi and incident with vi for some i∈[k].

For each i∈[k], there is a path graph Hi' such that Bi is obtained from Hi' by identifying vi1' and vi2' to vi with all edges originally incident with vi1' labelled by - 1 and all other edges not incident with vi1' labelled by 1 and satisfying F(Bi) = M(Hi').

For each i∈[k], let Hi be a path graph 2-isomorphic to Hi' with vi1'vi2'-paths changed to vi1vi2-paths. First add a new isolated vertex v to the graph [formula], and then add [formula] to Γ' by identifying vi2 with vi and [formula] with v. Let H denote the new graph. Then F(Ω) = M(H).

Evidently, (1) is an immediate consequence of Lemma [\ref=sign-bal]. Moreover, since each Bi is a signed graph with a blocking vertex vi, (2) follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=with-a-bal-vertex]. To show (3), let C be an arbitrary cycle of H. When [formula], the set C is also a balanced cycle of Ω. When C  ⊆  Ei for some i∈[k], since Hi is 2-isomorphic to Hi' and F(Bi) = M(Hi'), the set C is a circuit of F(Bi). So we may assume that [formula] for some i∈[k]. Evidently, there is only one integer i  ≠  j∈[k] such that [formula], and for any s∈{i,j}, the set [formula] is a vs1vs2-path of Hs; and consequently, [formula] is a vs1'vs2'-path of Hs' as Hs is a path graph 2-isomorphic to Hs' with vs1'vs2'-paths changed to vs1vs2-paths. Thus, by (1) and (2) C is a contra-balanced handcuff of Ω. So every circuit of M(H) is a circuit of F(Ω).

On the other hand, assume that C is an arbitrary circuit of F(Ω). Then C is a balanced cycle or a contra-balanced handcuff of Ω as Ω is a signed-graph. When C is a balanced cycle, no matter whether C  ⊆  Ei or [formula], by the definition of H it is easy to see that the set C is also a cycle of H as Hi is 2-isomorphic to Hi'. So we may assume that C is a contra-balanced handcuff of Ω. Without loss of generality we may assume [formula]. Then for any s∈{i,j}, the set [formula] is a vs1vs2-path of Hs as Hs is a path graph 2-isomorphic to Hs' with vs1'vs2'-paths changed to vs1vs2-paths. Therefore, C is also a cycle of H. So every circuit of F(Ω) is a circuit of M(H).

Therefore, when Ω has form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](3), it follows from Lemma [\ref=Zasvaslky-(4)-1] that Ω is obtained as a curling. Moreover, when G is 3-connected, by Corollary [\ref=type-2-con] each unbalanced block of Ω is a loop. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=Zasvaslky-(4)-1] we have the following result.

Let G be a 3-connected graph and let Ω be an unbalanced signed graph with F(Ω) = M(G). Assume that Ω has more than one unbalanced block. Then G is obtained from Γ by adding a new isolated vertex v to Γ and changing all loops to links connecting v and their original end-vertices.

Ω with form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](4)

In this section, we mainly characterize the signed graphs Ω representing the 2-connected graph G with form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](4). These have just one unbalanced block and no two vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles.

While Slilaty [\cite=MR2344133] characterized those signed graphs having no blocking vertex and no two vertex disjoint unbalanced cycles having graphic frame matroid in terms of projective-planar signed graphs and 1, 2, and 3-sums of balanced signed graphs, an application of a theorem on lift matroids gives us a different structural characterization. The lift matroid L(Ω) of a signed graph Ω was defined by Zaslavsky in [\cite=Zaslavsky-II]. Its circuits are the sets of edges of one of the following two types: balanced cycles and the union of two unbalanced cycles meeting in at most one vertex. In his Ph.D. thesis Shih proved the following characterisation of graphic lift matroids (see also [\cite=Pivotto], Theorem 4.1).

Let G be a graph and let Ω be a signed graph such that M(G) = L(Ω). Then there exists a graph H 2-isomorphic to G such that one of the following holds.

Ω is obtained from H by a pinch.

Ω is obtained from H by a 4-twisting.

Ω is obtained from H by a consecutive twisting.

Since L(Ω) = F(Ω) when Ω has no vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles, the signed graph we want to find consisting of one unbalanced block without vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles has the form of one of Theorem [\ref=Shih-Pivotto](1)-(3). However, the signed graph Ω in Theorem [\ref=Shih-Pivotto](3) may have vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles, so we only need to find all signed graphs having no vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles. Evidently, when Ω is obtained through [\ref=Shih-Pivotto](1), that is, obtained as a pinch, Ω has no two vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles. On the other hand, note that Ω has no vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles if and only if each cycle of G is connected in Γ. Thus, we only need to determine under which conditions a cycle of H is connected in Γ, for the graph H (2-isomorphic to G) given in Theorem [\ref=Shih-Pivotto].

Suppose that Ω is obtained from H by a 4-twisting as in Theorem [\ref=Shih-Pivotto](2). Then every cycle of H is connected in Γ.

Let C be an arbitrary cycle of H. Assume to the contrary that C is not connected in Γ. Then C is a union of two vertex-disjoint cycles C1 and C2 of Γ as M(G) = L(Ω). Moreover, by the definition of Γ, either [formula] or [formula]. By symmetry we may assume that the former holds. Then C1 is a cycle of H, a contradiction to the fact that C1 is a proper subset of the cycle C of H.

Suppose that Ω is obtained from H by a consecutive twisting as in Theorem [\ref=Shih-Pivotto](3). If G is 2-connected, then every cycle in H is connected in Γ if and only if for some i∈[k] no path connects xi and yi in [formula] when k is even.

First we prove the "only if" part. Assume to the contrary that k = 2n and for any i∈[k] there is a path connecting xi and yi in [formula]. Then G' has a cycle [formula], where Pxi,yi is a path of Hi connecting xi and yi with zi∉Pxi,yi. However, [formula] and [formula] are vertex-disjoint cycles of Γ such that (E(C1),E(C2)) is a partition of E(C), a contradiction.

Secondly, we prove the "if" part. Let C be an arbitrary cycle of H. Evidently, when C is completely contained in some Hi, the set C is also a cycle of Γ. So we may assume that C intersects at least two Hi's. Assume that at most one Hi|C uses zi. Under this case C must have the structure [formula], where Pxi,yi is a path of Hi connecting xi and yi; and hence, either k = 2n + 1 or k = 2n and there is exactly one integer i∈[k] with zi∈Pxi,yi, say i = 1. When k = 2n + 1, we have

[formula]

is a cycle of Γ with E(C) = E(C') if z1∉Px1,y1 and C' is the union of two edge-disjoint cycles of Γ sharing vertex z1 otherwise. When k = 2n (so z1∈Px1,y1), we have [formula] and [formula] are two edge-disjoint cycles of Γ with a unique common vertex u1. Hence, we can assume that there are exactly two Hi|C using zi. Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula], where Pz1,y1,Pxi,yi(2  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1),Pxm,zm are paths of H1,Hi,Hm, respectively. When m = 2s, the set

[formula]

is a cycle of Γ with E(C) = E(C'); and when m = 2s + 1, the set

[formula]

is a cycle of Γ with E(C) = E(C').

Suppose that Ω is obtained from H by a consecutive twisting, where k is even. If G is 2-connected and every cycle of H is connected in Γ, then Ω is a pinch.

By Lemma [\ref=Case3-2-con], for some i∈[k] no path connects xi and yi in [formula]. Then every unbalanced cycle in Ω uses zi, i.e. zi is a blocking vertex of Ω. Lemma [\ref=a-bal-vertex-case] implies that there is a graph H' 2-isomorphic to G such that Ω is obtained from H' by a pinch.

Therefore, by Lemmas [\ref=Case2], [\ref=Case3-2-con] and [\ref=Case-k-even], and the analysis in the paragraph following Theorem [\ref=Shih-Pivotto], those signed graphs Ω having F(Ω) isomorphic to M(G) with form Theorem [\ref=Zaslavsky](4) (that is, having just one unbalanced block and without two vertex-disjoint unbalanced cycles) are obtained by a pinch, a 4-twisting, or a consecutive odd-twisting.
