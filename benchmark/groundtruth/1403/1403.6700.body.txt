Spectroscopic version of theAharonov-Bohm effect

Introduction and conclusions

The Aharonov-Bohm effect [\cite=ab] consists in an observable influence of the potentials Aμ acting on a quantum system ψ in a region where [formula]. A very simple apparatus in which this effect should be observable is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:apparatus].

The toroidal coil provides, around its exterior, a region with zero magnetic field but non-vanishing vector potential, onto which the infrared absorption spectrum of gaseous hydrochloric acid is measured.

The vibrational spectrum of HCl is well described by the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian,

[formula]

where [formula] and ω0 is the characteristic frequency of vibration around equilibrium. p and x represents the relative momentum and position between hydrogen and chlorine. In the presence of a constant vector potential [formula], the HCl Hamiltonian reads

[formula]

where θ is the angle between the molecule axis and [formula]. Only the component of [formula] parallel to the molecule axis was used in the minimal coupling,

[formula]

The matricial representation of [\eqref=eq:H] in the usual basis {|n〉} reads,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Assuming the system has access only to the first two levels of energy, the trunkation

[formula]

leads to the eigenvalues

[formula]

Note that if α = 0 the original energy levels [formula] and [formula] are recovered.

The Aharonov-Bohm effect can be veryfied by observing an enlargement of the HCl absorption lines when the coil is turned on. Particularly, the first absorption, originally a sharp line located at [formula], would range from

[formula]

corresponding to light absorbed by molecules orthogonals to [formula], up to

[formula]

corresponding to light absorbed by molecules parallels to [formula].

As a final remark, we explicitly quote the expression of [formula] along the z-axis of the torus [\cite=toro], in the Coulomb gauge and approximation of inner radius (a) much smaller than revolution radius (b),

[formula]

For a torus with 103 wire loops and dimensions a = 2 cm, b = 6 cm and for infrared light of [formula] eV, a current of order [formula] A is necessary in order to

[formula]

thus making the enlargement of the absorption lines observable.

Discussion

For a long time, the interpretation of Aμ as being a real entity have been the subject of controversy due to the non gauge-invariance of such an object. The thought experiment originally idealized by Bohm and Aharonov consisted in measuring an interference pattern between two branches of a spitted coherent electron beam that traversed the outside region of a long solenoid, where [formula] but [formula]. At the time the experiment was performed and the interference pattern observed [\cite=ab-scat], many objections were made based on the fact that the residual field of the non-ideal solenoid could be "touching" the electron, thus transmiting the phase shift. Future experiments with toroidal-shaped devices confined by superconductor material [\cite=ab-toro] led to the confirmation in favour of the "orthodoxial" point of view: the potentials Aμ are indeed fields.

Despite the fact that the Aharonov-Bohm effect is, nowadays, a paradigm of quantum mechanics, it is worth pointing out an alternative method for veryfing the reality [\cite=reality] of [formula]. One advantage of the method suggested here is the usage of a macroscopic apparatus for producing [formula], in contrast to the μm-scale devices used in the diffractive versions of the effect. Also the technologies involved in the proposed scheme date back to the 19th century.
