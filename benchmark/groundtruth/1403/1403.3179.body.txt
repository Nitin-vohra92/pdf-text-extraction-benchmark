Introduction

A smooth real hypersurface M in a complex manifold X is said to be Levi-flat if it separates the ambient manifold X locally into two Stein domains. From Frobenius' theorem, it is equivalent for M to have a foliation F, called the Levi foliation, by non-singular complex hypersurfaces of X. By its definition, therefore, we have two viewpoints to study Levi-flat real hypersurfaces, namely, extrinsically from several complex variables and intrinsically from foliation theory.

One of the indications of such situation was observed by Brunella [\cite=brunella2008]. He proved that, under some regularity conditions, Takeuchi 1-convexity of the complement of a smooth compact Levi-flat real hypersurface follows from the positivity of its normal bundle N1,0. We can also go through its converse actually, and are able to establish the correspondence between these qualitative properties.

These two notions have their quantitative counterparts: Takeuchi 1-convexity is characterized by the existence of a boundary distance function whose Diederich-Fornaess exponent in a weak sense is positive, according to a work of Ohsawa and Sibony [\cite=ohsawa-sibony1998]; The positivity of the normal bundle is obviously determined by the existence of a hermitian metric with positive Chern curvature along the leaves. We can therefore expect a quantitative correspondence between the Diederich-Fornaess exponent and the Chern curvature along the leaves, and this is the main question of this paper.

Our answer is the following local expression that relates not only the two quantities but also an additional curvature-like term denoted by iAh, which has appeared in literature on foliation theory (cf. Frankel [\cite=frankel1995], Deroin [\cite=deroin2005]).

In particular, we have

As an application of this local formula, we give an observation that indicates a connection between boundary distance functions with constant local Diederich-Fornaess exponent and conformal harmonic measures with smooth density.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In §[\ref=Sprelim], we give the definition of the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent and explain how to construct the hermitian metric hδ which appeared in the statement of Theorem [\ref=localformula]. In §[\ref=Slocalformula], we show that the converse of Brunella's theorem actually holds in a sense and prove Theorem [\ref=localformula]. Their proofs are by direct computations in a suitable coordinate, which is referred to as a distinguished parametrization in this paper and based on Diederich and Fornaess [\cite=diederich-fornaess-worm] and Barrett and Fornaess [\cite=barrett-fornaess1988]. In §[\ref=Srelation], after recalling the notion of conformal harmonic measure, we prove Proposition [\ref=relation] and illustrate it by an example.

Preliminaries

The Diederich-Fornaess exponent

Let us begin by recalling the definition of the Diederich-Fornaess exponent.

Let X be a complex manifold and [formula] a relatively compact domain with C2-smooth boundary. We say that a C2-smooth function [formula] is a boundary distance function of Ω if Ω  =  {δ  >  0} and dδ  ≠  0 on ∂Ω.

We denote by ηδ the supremum of η∈(0,1) such that -  δη is strictly plurisubharmonic in Ω except a compact subset, and call it the Diederich-Fornaess exponent (in the weak sense) of δ. If there is no such η, we let ηδ  =  0.

Note that we usually require -  δη to be strictly plurisubharmonic everywhere in Ω to define the Diederich-Fornaess exponent, but in this paper we will consider the Diederich-Fornaess exponent in this weak sense; we will omit mentioning that it is in the weak sense hereafter.

We denote by η(Ω) the supremum of the Diederich-Fornaess exponents of boundary distance functions of Ω and call it the Diederich-Fornaess index of Ω.

Ohsawa and Sibony gave a characterization for Ω to have positive η(Ω).

Ohsawa proved in [\cite=ohsawa2007] that η(Ω)  =  0 for Ω with C∞-smooth Levi-flat boundary whenever X is a compact Kähler manifold of [formula]. Nevertheless, in some compact Kähler surface X, η(Ω) can be positive even if Ω has Levi-flat boundary. See [\cite=diederich-ohsawa2007] and [\cite=adachi2014].

To compare the Diederich-Fornaess exponent of Ω with certain curvatures of the normal bundle of the Levi-flat boundary ∂Ω, we need the following pointwise notion regarding the Diederich-Fornaess exponent.

Let δ be a boundary distance function of Ω. For each p∈∂Ω, we denote by ηδ(p) the supremum of η∈(0,1) such that -  δη is strictly plurisubharmonic on [formula] where U runs over neighborhoods of p in X, and call it the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent of δ at p∈∂Ω. If there is no such η, we let ηδ(p)  =  0.

Note that the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent ηδ(p) is a lower semi-continuous function on ∂Ω from its definition and ηδ  =   min p∈∂Ωηδ(p).

Herbig and McNeal [\cite=herbig-mcneal2012] gave a lower estimate of the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent of the Euclidean boundary distance function of [formula] using the angle of a certain cone in the real tangent space Tp∂Ω. We remark that their lower estimate turns into a dichotomy at weakly pseudoconvex points, where γ-plurisubharmonicity holds either only for γ  =  0 or for any γ  ≥  0 (cf. [\cite=herbig-mcneal2012]).

Biard [\cite=biardthese] gave a lower estimate of the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent using a function called τ. Our Theorem [\ref=localformula] can be regarded as a refinement of her result in terms of boundary invariants when ∂Ω is C3-smooth Levi-flat.

Fu and Shaw [\cite=fu-shaw2014] gave other lower estimates of the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent in terms of several geometric quantities.

The normal bundle

Let us explain how to make a hermitian metric of the normal bundle of a Levi-flat real hypersurface from a boundary distance function of its complement.

From now on, we work with [formula] with C3-smooth Levi-flat boundary M. We denote the holomorphic tangent bundle of M by [formula] where JX denotes the complex structure of X. We identify the subbundle TF  ⊂  TX|M with T1,0M  ⊂  T1,0X|M via the standard identification. The bundle T1,0M is called the CR structure of M. The Levi-flatness of M implies the integrability of TF in the sense of Frobenius, and defines a foliation F of M by non-singular complex hypersurfaces called the Levi foliation. The foliation F is not only C2-smooth as expected from Frobenius' theorem but also C3-smooth according to a theorem of Barrett and Fornaess [\cite=barrett-fornaess1988].

We call [formula] the normal bundle of a Levi-flat real hypersurface M.

The normal bundle N1,0 is an intrinsic notion on Levi-flat real hypersurfaces, and the trivialization cover of N1,0 coming from foliated charts of M shows that N1,0 is a leafwise flat [formula]-bundle. Note that N1,0 is different from the normal bundle NM / X of a real hypersurface M in X; the connection of N1,0 with the ambient space X can be described by an isomorphism N1,0≃(T1,0X|M)  /  T1,0M. This expression clearly shows that N1,0 is a CR line bundle.

Now let δ be a C3-smooth boundary distance function of Ω. We take an arbitrary foliated chart with parametrization [formula]. Note that φ(z',t) is C3-smooth and holomorphic in z'. We define a C2-smooth positive function hδ on V by

[formula]

Take two intersecting foliated charts and consider their parametrizations for the intersection U, say [formula] (k  =  α,β). We denote their transition function by [formula] and denote ψ(z'α,tα)  =  (z'β(z'α,tα),tβ(tα)). By the chain rule,

[formula]

where we simply denote (z'β)j  =  xj  +  iyj. We have

[formula]

since [formula] are tangent to M  =  {δ  =  0}. This equality exactly shows that hδ defines a hermitian metric of N1,0.

Brunella's correspondence and its quantitative version

Distinguished parametrizations

We will introduce first a special coordinate, which is essential to prove Proposition [\ref=converse] and Theorem [\ref=localformula].

We continue to work with [formula] with C3-smooth Levi-flat boundary M and denote the Levi foliation by F. Take a point p∈M and consider a holomorphic coordinate [formula] around p. We write zj  =  xj  +  iyj and identify p with the origin. We can easily see that the holomorphic coordinate can be chosen so that [formula], TpM≃{yn  =  0} and [formula] is an inner normal vector for Ω at p where Lp denotes the leaf of F passing through p. Furthermore, we can make the holomorphic coordinate to satisfy TqM≃{yn  =  0} for any [formula] thanks to the argument used in Diederich and Fornaess [\cite=diederich-fornaess-worm]*Theorem 8 and Barrett and Fornaess [\cite=barrett-fornaess1988]*Proposition.

Since F is C3-smooth, we have a foliated chart of F around p whose parametrization φ into the holomorphic coordinate U is described as φ(z',t)  =  (z',ζ(z',t)) where [formula] is a C3-smooth function defined near (0',0) that is holomorphic in z' and [formula]. Note that ζ(z',0)  =  0 and [formula] from the choice of the holomorphic coordinate. The latter follows from [formula], the holomorphicity of [formula] in z' and [formula]. We refer to this parametrization φ in the coordinate (U,z) as a distinguished parametrization around p.

Curvatures of the normal bundle

To state Proposition [\ref=converse] and Theorem [\ref=localformula] precisely, we introduce two notions of curvature of the normal bundle.

We denote by ∂b (resp. [formula]) the (1,0)-part (resp. (0,1)-part) of the exterior derivative along the leaves, namely,

[formula]

for a function f on a foliated chart with coordinate [formula]. The operator [formula] is also known as the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator.

For a (leafwise) C2-smooth hermitian metric h of N1,0, we let [formula] and call it the Chern curvature of h along the leaves. We also denote [formula].

We say N1,0 is positive along the leaves if iΘh defines a positive definite quadratic form on T1,0M everywhere for some h.

Note that the leafwise flatness of N1,0 assures the well-definedness of iAh; on the other hand, the Chern curvature along the leaves can be defined in fact for arbitrary CR line bundle over a Levi-flat real hypersurface equipped with a (leafwise) C2-smooth hermitian metric.

Brunella's correspondence

Now we rephrase a theorem of Brunella in our context by using Ohsawa-Sibony's theorem.

Let us prove the converse of Brunella's theorem in the following sense.

We equip N1,0 with the hermitian metric hδ induced from δ. Take a point p∈M and we will show that iΘhδ(p) defines a positive definite quadratic form on T1,0pM.

Take a distinguished parametrization φ  =  (z',ζ(z',t)) in [formula] around p. Since [formula],

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

On the other hand, from Ohsawa-Sibony's theorem, we have a hermitian metric ω on X so that [formula] in Ω except a compact subset; in particular,

[formula]

holds for 0  <  yn  ≪  1. Since

[formula]

holds for 0  <  yn  ≪  1 and δ(z',iyn) / yn extends to [formula] as a C2-smooth function, letting [formula], we conclude with

[formula]

This observation gives a negative answer to Question 1 of [\cite=adachi2014]. If the complement of a Levi-flat real hypersurface is Takeuchi 1-convex, its Levi foliation cannot contain any compact leaf L. That is because Proposition [\ref=converse] yields the positivity of N1,0, therefore, N1,0|L is also positive and   ≠  0 in [formula]; but, N1,0|L is topologically trivial and   =  0. This is absurd. Therefore, in the cases (iii) and (iv) in [\cite=adachi2014]*Theorem 3.1, their associated holomorphic disc bundles cannot be Takeuchi 1-convex.

Expression of the local Diederich-Fornaess exponent

We are going to prove Theorem [\ref=localformula]. Although the idea of its proof is similar to that of Proposition [\ref=converse], this time we will deal with the complex hessian matrix of -  δη instead of that of -   log δ and this change requires us to look at not only z'-directions but also zn-direction. The following elementary lemma helps us to handle mixed components of those.

We continue to use the local situation in the proof of Proposition [\ref=converse].

Let us consider the (1,1)-form

[formula]

and identify this with a hermitian matrix H and denote its component by [formula]. As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=converse], for 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n - 1,

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1,k  =  n,

[formula]

for j  =  k  =  n,

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

by its definition. Lemma [\ref=posidef] yields a

H(0',iyn) is positive definite if and only if

[formula]

is positive definite at (0',iyn), for 0  <  yn  ≪  1 where o(1) are vanishing terms as [formula].

Now we prove the equality

[formula]

by showing the inequalities for both directions.

From the claim, η  <  ηδ(p) implies [formula]. Note that iΘhδ(p)  -  εiAhδ(p)  ≥  0 implies iΘhδ(p)  -  ε'iAhδ(p)  >  0 for 0  ≤  ε'  <  ε since iΘhδ(p)  >  0 from Proposition [\ref=converse]. We thus have

[formula]

To show the other inequality, first we see from the claim that [formula] implies [formula] is strictly plurisubharmonic on Γp, a neighborhood of {(0',iyn)|0  <  yn  ≪  1} in Ω. From the continuity of iΘhδ and iAhδ, we can find a neighborhood W  ⊂  M of p so that [formula] for any q∈W. We apply the same argument at each q∈W and conclude that [formula] is strictly plurisubharmonic on [formula], which yields

[formula]

The proof is completed.

The exponent of conformal harmonic measures

Conformal harmonic measure

Let us briefly recall the notion of conformal harmonic measure following Brunella [\cite=brunella2007]. For the notions of foliated harmonic measure and current, and their applications, we refer the reader to Fornaess and Sibony [\cite=fornaess-sibony2008] and Deroin [\cite=deroin-lectnote].

We work with a complex surface X and [formula] with C3-smooth Levi-flat boundary M. We endow the Levi foliation with a continuous leafwise hermitian metric ω and its associated volume form [formula]. We restrict ourselves to describe conformal harmonic measures in this setting.

Let M  ⊂  M be a compact saturated set of the Levi foliation of M. Consider a finite cover {U} of M by foliated charts [formula] and denote the transversals of M by [formula]. A collection of transverse measures {νU} is said to be conformal of exponent α (> 0) adapted to M if

Each νU is a finite Borel measure supported on MU;

{νU} relate in the following manner

[formula]

when two foliated charts U and V intersect.

The example in mind is the α-dimensional Hausdorff measure Hα on transversals MU with 0  <  Hα(MU)  <    ∞  , then the exponent is just α.

A measure μ supported on a compact saturated set M  ⊂  M is said to be a conformal harmonic measure of exponent α if there exists a finite cover {U} of M by foliated charts with which μ has a local disintegration [formula] on each U such that

{νU} is a collection of transverse measures and conformal of exponent α adapted to M;

hU is a non-negative real-valued function on U which is integrable with respect to [formula], and log hU is bounded on [formula];

On νU-almost every plaque of M, hU is positive and [formula]-closed.

The Diederich-Fornaess exponent and the exponent of conformal harmonic measures

We are going to prove Proposition [\ref=relation].

Let us suppose the existence of a C3-smooth boundary distance function δ with ηδ(p)  =  η on M. Consider the hermitian metric hαδ of [formula] induced from hδ of N1,0, where we put [formula]. Note that N1,0 is a flat CR line bundle over M with structure group [formula], and its power [formula] is well-defined for [formula]. From its transition rule, we have a well-defined measure μ supported on M by letting [formula] on each foliated chart U.

The measure μ is a conformal harmonic measure of exponent α: We take an arbitrary finite cover of M by foliated charts and disintegrate μ as in its definition. Since 0  <  Hα(MU)  <    ∞   is supposed on each foliated chart U, we can check the requirements for μ to be a conformal harmonic measure except [formula]-closedness of hαδ on plaques contained in M. It follows from Theorem [\ref=localformula] that

[formula]

everywhere on M, and this yields that

[formula]

The obtained conformal harmonic measure is very special one since it has C2-smooth local coefficient hαδ.

An expected condition α  ≤  1 and the formula α  =  (η- 1  -  1)- 1 suggest that η  ≤  1 / 2. This actually holds in a general context; we refer the reader to our forthcoming paper [\cite=adachi-brinkschulte2014] and a paper of Fu and Shaw [\cite=fu-shaw2014].

We conclude this paper with an example that illustrates the situation in Proposition [\ref=relation].
