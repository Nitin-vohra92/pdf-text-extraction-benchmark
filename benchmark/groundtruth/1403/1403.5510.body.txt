Abstract: Let (Fn)n  ≥  0 and (Ln)n  ≥  0 denote the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences. The present work studies algebraic independence of the numbers [formula], where [formula] is fixed, [formula] are non-zero periodic sequences of algebraic numbers and the sum is taken over all integers h  ≥  0 satisfying [formula]. Also results for more general sequences are obtained. The main tool is Mahler's method reducing the investigation of the algebraic independence of numbers (over [formula]) to the one of functions (over the rational function field) if these satisfy certain types of functional equations.

Keywords: Algebraic independence of numbers, Mahler's method, algebraic independence of functions.

Introduction and main results

The Fibonacci sequence [formula] and the Lucas sequence [formula] satisfy the recurrence

[formula]

with initial conditions y0 = 0,y1 = 1 and y0 = 2,y1 = 1, respectively. In the present paper, we are interested in the algebraic independence of the numbers

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is fixed, [formula] and [formula] are non-zero periodic sequences of algebraic numbers, and [formula] is taken over those [formula] with non-zero denominator and [formula]. To present our first result, we introduce a set of positive integers

[formula]

Then each integer [formula] has a unique representation in the form r = dj with [formula], and we define d(r): = d.

Theorem 1. The numbers

[formula]

are algebraically independent, unless (bh) is constant. In this special case, F0,2 is algebraic, but all other numbers in ([\ref=a3]) are algebraically independent.

This result gives a partial generalization of many earlier results considering separately the numbers [formula] or [formula], see e.g. [\cite=BT], [\cite=DKT], [\cite=KKS], [\cite=Ni1], [\cite=Ni2], [\cite=NTT] and the references there. For fixed [formula], we refer to [\cite=BV].

More generally, let γ1 and γ2 be non-zero algebraic numbers satisfying [formula], and define

[formula]

where g1,g2,h1,h2 are non-zero algebraic numbers. Moreover, let Ω: = (g1h2) / (g2h1). In particular, the special choice (Rn) = (Fn),(Sn) = (Ln) yields Ω =  - 1. Next, for fixed [formula], we introduce for [formula] the three series

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] are, as above, non-zero periodic sequences of algebraic numbers. Then we have the following generalization of Theorem 1.

Theorem 2. If [formula], then the numbers

[formula]

are algebraically independent, unless there exists an [formula] satisfying one of the following properties: 1) [formula] and (bh) is constant; 2) [formula] and (ch) is constant; 3) [formula] and [formula], where θ = e2πi / 3; 4) [formula] and [formula], where θ = e- 2πi / 3. In case 1) (or 2)), the number [formula] (or [formula], respectively) is algebraic but all other numbers in ([\ref=a5]) are algebraically independent. In cases 3) and 4), after removing all numbers [formula] from ([\ref=a5]), the remaining numbers are algebraically independent.

Again here there are several results considering separately the numbers [formula] or [formula], and even the powers of these, see [\cite=NTT]. We would like to point out that also our considerations below could be generalized to prove the algebraic independence of

[formula]

[formula]

The extra condition [formula] is needed, since in the case r = 2 there are dependence relations with even values of m, see [\cite=BV1].

Let now [formula] be non-zero algebraic numbers satisfying [formula] for [formula], and let [formula] with algebraic [formula] such that [formula]. In proving Theorems 1 and 2, we obtain also a result on the values of the functions

[formula]

[formula]

Theorem 3. Let [formula] be as above. If α is an algebraic number with [formula] and [formula] for all [formula] and [formula], then the numbers

[formula]

are algebraically independent, unless one of the following cases holds: 1) (bh) is constant and α0 = 1; 2) (ch) is constant and β0 = 1; 3) α0 = e2πi / 3 and β0  =  α20; 4) α0  =  e- 2πi / 3 and β0  =  α20. In case 1) (or 2)), Φ0,2(α) (or Λ0,2(α), respectively) is algebraic, but all other numbers in ([\ref=a6]) are algebraically independent. In case 3) (or 4)), after removing the numbers Φ0,2j(α) (or Λ0,2j(α)) with [formula] from ([\ref=a6]) the remaining numbers are algebraically independent.

The preceding statement also applies assuming [formula] and [formula] for [formula], and [formula] for all [formula]. Here the cases 3) and 4) cannot occur.

Finally, we note the following corollary of Theorem 3 considering the values of Fredholm-type series.

Corollary 1. For algebraic α with 0 < |α| < 1, the numbers

[formula]

are algebraically independent.

This gives some further information on the values of series of this type, for earlier results see [\cite=Ni0] and [\cite=Ni2].

The main ideas of the proofs of our results are similar to [\cite=NTT]. First, in Section 2, we consider linear independence of Mahler-type functions related to our results. Here the considerations needed for the case [formula] with some [formula] and [formula], are most interesting and challenging, in fact the case [formula] follows essentially from the studies in [\cite=NTT]. Then, following the lines of [\cite=NTT], the algebraic independence of the functions (over [formula]) under consideration and of their values (over [formula]) are proved, giving Theorem 3. In the final Section 5, the connection of the numbers in our theorems with such function values implies the validity of Theorems 1 and 2.

Linear independence of functions

In our first lemma, we are interested in the Mahler-type functions

[formula]

where r  ≥  2 is an integer, a  ≠  0 is a complex number, [formula], and, for any i  ≥  1,Ai(z) and Bi(z) are coprime, and the Bi(z) are distinct, non-constant, and monic. Clearly

[formula]

Lemma 1. For each [formula], assume that Bi(z) (as above) has exactly ti distinct zeros all of them of the same absolute value ωi. Let all [formula] be distinct, and ωm = 1. In case [formula], suppose furthermore (r - 1)ti  ≥  tj for every pair (i,j) with 1  ≤  i,j < m. Then the function

[formula]

with [formula] is rational if and only if [formula] and the function u0F0(z) + umFm(z) is rational.

Proof. Clearly, we may assume [formula] and [formula]. The function [formula] in our lemma satisfies the functional equation

[formula]

Assuming that g(z) is rational, it must have poles of absolute value [formula], and we may first suppose of absolute value > 1. Let p be such a pole with maximal absolute value. Then |p| = ωi with some [formula]. Clearly, p cannot be a pole of g(zr). Thus, the hypotheses of our lemma together with ([\ref=a7]) imply that all distinct zeros of Bi(z), say [formula], are poles of g(z), hence rti numbers [formula] are poles of g(zr). By the distinctness of the ω's, the function ag(zr) - g(z) has exactly tj poles of the same absolute value ωj (if [formula]), and therefore at least rti - tj (  ≥  ti) of the above [formula] are poles of g(z) (assuming [formula]). Let these be [formula] with v  ≥  ti. The rv numbers [formula] are poles of g(zr), and again at least rv - tk (  ≥  ti) of these are poles of g(z). By repeating this conclusion, we get a contradiction. The same argument works if g(z) has poles of absolute value < 1 (but note that 0 is not a pole of g(z)). [formula]

We now consider some special functions of the above type, namely

[formula]

[formula]

where a and all [formula] are non-zero complex numbers. These functions satisfy the following functional equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Lemma 2. Suppose [formula] for [formula], and [formula] with [formula] for any [formula]. If [formula] and, for some non-negative integer L, the [formula] with [formula] are complex numbers, then the function

[formula]

is rational if and only if [formula] for any [formula], and the following function is rational

[formula]

Proof. If g(z) denotes the function ([\ref=a11]), then

[formula]

holds, by ([\ref=a10]), with [formula]. Assume now that g(z) is rational.

We begin with the case [formula], where we intend to apply Lemma 1. Consider the integers [formula] with [formula]. If [formula] holds for such an [formula] but [formula], then the corresponding [formula] in the sense of Lemma 1 equals 2. If, on the other hand, [formula], then the contribution

[formula]

to the sum in ([\ref=p1]) has coprime non-zero [formula], whence the corresponding [formula] is 4. With these two possibilities for the t's in Lemma 1, we see that the condition (r - 1)ti  ≥  tj imposed there is satisfied, by [formula]. Thus, Lemma 1 implies Lemma 2 in this case.

We are left with the case r = 2. Suppose that there exists some [formula] with [formula] and, moreover, [formula]. Let [formula] be the index with smallest [formula] having this property.

Before arguing further, we need the following intermediate claim. If ω with |ω| > 1 is a pole of g(z), then |ω|  ≥  |αm|. Assume, on the contrary, that 1 < |ω| < |αm|. Then [formula] is a pole of g(z2) and also a pole of g(z), by

[formula]

But then [formula] is a pole of g(z2), hence a pole of g(z), again by ([\ref=b1]). Repeating this argument we get a contradiction proving our claim.

With m defined above, we assume [formula] (the case [formula] being similar). As we saw, g(z) is polefree in the circular annulus 1 < |z| < |αm|. Hence, by ([\ref=b1]), the function

[formula]

is holomorphic in our annulus from which we have removed the points [formula] and [formula] (if [formula]), and the points [formula] if these points lie in the annulus. Letting now [formula] (or [formula], one sees from the definition of h(z) that g(z) must have a pole at αm. Assume that [formula] with [formula] and a positive integer k indicates the beginning of the Laurent expansion of g(z) at αm, we find

[formula]

near [formula] and [formula]. Thus, we obtain k = 1 and [formula], hence [formula] and [formula] leading to um = 0, a contradiction. Thus, Lemma 2 is proved if there exists some [formula], with [formula] and [formula]. If, for all [formula], with [formula], the inequality [formula] holds, the proof is similar. [formula]

Remark 1. If we assume that [formula] and [formula] for [formula], and [formula] for all [formula], then we see, as at the beginning of the above proof of Lemma 2, that the function g(z) in ([\ref=a11]) is rational if and only if [formula] for all [formula], and the following function is rational

[formula]

The subsequent Lemma 3 concerns just the question in which cases the function ([\ref=a12]) can be rational.

Lemma 3. Suppose |α0| = 1 and β0  =  δ0α0 with [formula]. Suppose that [formula] v0 are complex numbers, not all zero, and let g0(z) denote the function ([\ref=a12]). If either [formula], or r = 3 and [formula], then g0(z) is not rational. If r = 2 and [formula], then this function is rational if and only if p1 = 0 and, moreover, one of the following six conditions holds, ζ denoting eπi / 3: 1) a = 1,α0 = 1,v0 = 0; 2) a = 1,β0 = 1,u0 = 0; 3,4) [formula]; 5,6) [formula].

Remark 2. In case 1), φ0(1,z) is the rational function z / (z - 1), and in case 2), λ0(1,z) is this same function. In case 3),

[formula]

holds, and in case 5), the roles of φ0(1,z) and λ0(1,z) are reversed. In case 4),

[formula]

holds, whereas in case 6), the roles of φ0(1,z) and λ0(1,z) are reversed. But it should be noted that, in all cases concerning a = 1, a solution g of ([\ref=p1]), ([\ref=b1]), or ([\ref=a13]) below is only determined up to an arbitrary additive constant.

Proof of Lemma 3. Our function g0(z) satisfies

[formula]

where A(z) is the polynomial from the beginning of the proof of Lemma 2.

We first show: If (u0,v0) = (0,0) (implying [formula]), then g0(z) is not rational. Assuming, on the contrary, that g0(z) = U(z) / V(z) with coprime [formula], we have

[formula]

hence V(zr)|V(z), and therefore deg V = 0, whence g0(z) is a non-constant polynomial with [formula], say. Hence deg (ag0(zr) = Gr, deg (g0(z) - A(z))  ≤   max (G,r - 1) giving the desired contradiction. (Note here: If g0 would be constant, then A as well, by ([\ref=a13]) with (u0,v0) = (0,0).)

Assume now that [formula] and v0 = 0, the case [formula] being similar. Clearly, all poles ω of g0(z) satisfy |ω| = 1, and rt  ≤  t + 2 or [formula], where t denotes the number of distinct poles. Thus, we have a contradiction if [formula]. If r = 3, then [\cite=BV] gives a contradiction. In case r = 2, [\cite=BV] implies that the only possibility is p1 = 0,a = α0 = 1 and, in this case, φ0(1,z) is the rational function we already saw in Remark 2.

Next, let us assume that [formula]. This time we get the upper bound [formula] for the number of distinct poles of g0(z). Thus, we need to consider only the values r = 2,3,4 and 5, and [formula] if [formula] if r = 3, and t = 1 otherwise. By comparing the arguments of the possible poles on both sides of ([\ref=a13]), we immediately get a contradiction if r = 5. In case r = 4, [\cite=BV] gives a contradiction, too.

Assume now r = 3. Then [formula], and we immediately see that we must have t = 2. Let ω1 and ω2 be the distinct poles of g0(z) with arguments 0  ≤  τ1  <  τ2 < 2π, respectively. The arguments of the poles on the left-hand side of ([\ref=a13]) are τ1 / 3 + j2π / 3,τ2 / 3 + j2π / 3,j = 0,1,2, and the arguments of the possible poles on the right-hand side are τ1,τ2,φ1 / 2,φ1 / 2 + π,φ2 / 2,φ2 / 2 + π, where φ1  =   min ( arg α0, arg β0),φ2  =   max ( arg α0, arg β0),0  ≤  φ1  <  φ2 < 2π. If τ1 = 0, then comparision of the arguments of the poles gives us one possibility, where φ1 = 2π / 3,φ2 = 4π / 3,τ1 = 0,τ2  =  π. By denoting ζ = eπi / 3, we get z3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z - ζ2)(z - ζ4),z3 + 1 = (z + 1)(z - ζ)(z - ζ5),z2  -  α0 = (z - ζ)(z - ζ4),z2  -  β0 = (z - ζ2)(z - ζ5) , where we assumed (w.l.o.g.) φ1  =   arg α0,φ2  =   arg β0. Therefore g0(z) in ([\ref=a13]) takes the shape g0(z) = P(z) / (z2 - 1), where [formula], and we get

[formula]

This yields aP(1) = 3P(1), and since [formula], this contradicts our assumption [formula].

In the case τ1 > 0, we have also one possibility, φ1  =  π / 3,φ2 = 5π / 3,τ1  =  π / 2,τ2 = 3π / 2. Thus g0(z) = P(z) / (z2 + 1), where [formula]. By ([\ref=a13]),

[formula]

Thus, a2P(i) = 3aP( - i) = 9P(i) giving a2 = 9, which contradicts our assumptions.

We are left with the case [formula] as noticed above. We assume firstly that none of α0,β0 is equal to 1.

Let t = 4 and ωj with 0  ≤  τj  =   arg ωj < 2π (j = 1,2,3,4) be the poles. W.l.o.g. we may assume that 0  ≤  τ1  <  τ2  <  τ3  <  τ4 < 2π and 0 < φ1  =   arg α0  <  φ2  =   arg β0 < 2π. Comparing the arguments on both sides of ([\ref=a13]) gives τ4  =  φ2. If τ1 = 0, then we must have τ2  =  φ1 and {τ3 / 2,π,τ3 / 2 + π}  =  {φ1, τ3, φ2}. This means that τ3  =  π,φ1  =  π / 2,φ2 = 3π / 2, and ω1 = 1,ω2  =  α0 = i,ω3 =  - 1,ω4  =  β0 =  - i. Thus, g0(z) = P(z) / (z4 - 1), where P(z) is a polynomial satisfying [formula]. Now ([\ref=a13]) gives

[formula]

hence aP(1) = 2P(1), and so a = 2, contrary to our assumptions. In the case τ1 > 0, we must have τ1  =  φ1 and {τ2 / 2,τ3 / 2,τ2 / 2 + π,τ3 / 2 + π}  =  {φ1,τ2,τ3,φ2}. We therefore have τ2 = 2φ1,τ3 = 4φ1,φ1  +  π = 4φ1 or φ1  =  π / 3, and finally φ2 = 5π / 3. By denoting ζ = eπi / 3 as above, we have ω1  =  α0  =  ζ,ω2  =  ζ2,ω3  =  ζ4,ω4  =  β0  =  ζ5. As before, we now have

[formula]

where P(z) satisfies [formula]. On substituting z =  - ζ and z = ζ2 to the last equation, we are led to

[formula]

respectively, implying a2 = 4 but again this contradicts our assumptions.

Let now t = 3. Comparing the arguments of the poles gives here four possibilities: 1) ω1 = 1,ω2  =  α0 = i,ω3  =  β0 =  - 1; 2) ω1 = 1,ω2  =  α0 =  - 1,ω3  =  β0 =  - i; 3) ω1  =  α0  =  ζ,ω2  =  ζ2,ω3  =  β0  =  ζ4; 4) ω1  =  α0  =  ζ2,ω2  =  ζ4,ω3  =  β0  =  ζ5.

In case 1), we apply ([\ref=a13]) and obtain

[formula]

with some polynomial P(z) satisfying [formula]. Therefore aP(1) = 2P(1) and a = 2. In case 2), we get the same contradiction to our assumptions.

Using ([\ref=a13]) we get in case 3)

[formula]

where P(z) satisfies [formula]. Taking here z = ζ2 and z =  - ζ2 we obtain

[formula]

respectively, hence aP( - ζ) = 2P(ζ2). Inserting, moreover, z =  - ζ we find aP(ζ2) = P( - ζ), and the last two equations lead to a2 = 2, contrary to our assumptions. Case 4) can be similarly dealt with.

Assume finally t = 2. In this case, a reasoning as above implies one possibility, namely ω1  =  α0  =  ζ2,ω2  =  β0  =  ζ4. By using ([\ref=a13]), we therefore get

[formula]

where P(z) satisfies [formula]. For z = ζ and z =  - ζ2, we get aP(ζ2) =  - u0ζ2(1 + ζ) and aP(ζ4) = v0(1 + ζ), respectively. Thus, applying ([\ref=b3]) with z = ζ2 and z =  - ζ, we find after some minor computation

[formula]

respectively. This gives immediately a2 = 1 hence [formula].

If a =  - 1, then the above implies u0ζ2(1 + ζ) = P(ζ2) =  - ζP(ζ4) = v0ζ(1 + ζ). Thus, v0 = u0ζ and ([\ref=b3]) gives

[formula]

From this equation, we deduce [formula], say P(z) = P1z + P2z2, and p1 = 0. Then the above equation leads to P1 = u0(1 + ζ),P2 = 0, and the rational function

[formula]

satisfies ([\ref=a13]) in this case.

In case a = 1, we have - u0ζ2(1 + ζ) = P(ζ2) = ζP(ζ4) = v0ζ(1 + ζ) giving v0 =  - u0ζ. By ([\ref=b3]),

[formula]

Again we are led to [formula] and p1 = 0. By substituting P(z) = P1z + P2z2 to the above equation, we obtain P1 =  - u0(1 - ζ),P2 = 2P1. (Note here that, in virtue of our concluding statement in Remark 2, we are allowed to assume P(0) = 0, w.l.o.g.) Thus, in this case, ([\ref=a13]) has a rational solution

[formula]

We still have to consider the case α0 = 1. Now the cases t = 3 or t = 4 are clearly not possible, and t = 2 is only possible if ω1 = 1,ω2  =  β0 =  - 1. By ([\ref=a13]),

[formula]

with some polynomial P(z) satisfying [formula]. Therefore aP( - 1) = 2iv0 and aP( - 1) =  - 2iv0 giving P( - 1) = 0, a contradiction.

Thus, the condition [formula] holds exactly in cases 3)-6), and this completes the proof of Lemma 3. [formula]

Remark 3. From the beginning of the above proof it follows that, under the assumptions of Remark 1, the function ([\ref=b2]) is rational if and only if r = 2,p1 = 0,a = α0 = 1 and, in this case, φ0(1,z) is rational.

Algebraic independence of functions

For a sequence [formula] of complex numbers, we denote by [formula], the sequences

[formula]

By [\cite=NTT], these sequences have the following properties: a) If [formula] is a periodic sequence, not identically zero, then the sequences [formula] are linearly independent over [formula]. b) If [formula] is a periodic sequence with period length greater than 1, then [formula] are linearly independent over [formula], (1) being the obvious constant sequence.

The following lemma will be needed (see [\cite=NTT]).

Lemma 4. Let p be a positive integer, [formula] a periodic sequence with period lenght dividing p, and let R(z) be the quotient of two polynomials in [formula] such that the numerator vanishes at the origin of [formula] but the denominator does not. Further, define

[formula]

Then, for any [formula],

[formula]

holds for [formula] with rational functions Rr,j(z).  (Note here [formula].

Proof. According to the definition of fr(z), we have [formula], hence

[formula]

(with [formula]), and this equals frj(z) up to a rational function. [formula]

Let now [formula], and suppose

[formula]

where the numerators vanish at the origin but the denominators do not. Then we define

[formula]

Further, let [formula] be non-zero periodic sequences of complex numbers with period lengths pk, respectively, put [formula], and denote, moreover,

[formula]

By following ideas of [\cite=NTT], we can now prove

Lemma 5. If, for any root of unity ξ, the functions ([\ref=a14]) formed with a = ξ are linearly independent over [formula] modulo [formula] , then the functions

[formula]

are algebraically independent over [formula].

Proof. Assume, on the contrary, that there exists an [formula] such that the functions

[formula]

are algebraically dependent. By Lemma 4, we may apply [\cite=Ni0], whence these functions are linearly dependent over [formula] modulo [formula]. Thus, there exist complex numbers ak,m,j, not all zero, such that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Here all sequences

[formula]

are periodic with period lengths dividing s!p, and therefore there exist complex numbers Ak,m,i such that, for all [formula],

[formula]

with a primitive (s!p)-th root of unity ω. By property a) from the beginning of this section, not all Ak,m,i vanish. Thus, G(z) has the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Let now J: = {i:0  ≤  i  ≤  s!p  -  1 and at least one Ak,m,i  ≠  0}. As noted above J is not empty. By applying again [\cite=Ni0] to the functions Gi(z),i∈J, it follows that there exists an i0∈J such that [formula] (note that the ωi are distinct). By our hypothesis on linear independence of the fk,m(ωi0,z), we get the contradiction that all Ak,m,i0 vanish, proving Lemma 5. [formula]

We now apply the above results to the functions of one variable

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Lemma 6. Assume that [formula] and [formula] satisfy the conditions of [formula] and [formula] in Lemma 2, and let [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. If [formula], then the functions

[formula]

are algebraically independent over [formula]. If r = 2, then the functions ([\ref=a21]) are algebraically independent apart from the following cases: 1) (bh) is constant and α0,2 = 1; 2) (ch) is constant and β0,2 = 1; 3) α0,2  =  ζ2,β0,2  =  ζ4; 4) α0,2  =  ζ4,β0,2  =  ζ2, where ζ = eπi / 3 as in Lemma 3. In the cases 1) and 2), either [formula], or [formula], respectively, but all other functions in ([\ref=a21]) are algebraically independent over [formula]. In the cases 3) and 4), after removing the functions φ0,2j(z) (or [formula] from ([\ref=a21]), the remaining functions are algebraically independent over [formula].

Proof. We suppose that there exist [formula] such that the functions

[formula]

are algebraically dependent, and deduce a contradiction.

We shall use Lemma 5, where (b1,h) = (ah),t1 = r - 1,  (b2,h) = (bh),t2 = 2L + 1,  (b3,h) = (ch),t3   =   2L + 1. Further, f1,m(z),f2,m(z),f3,m(z) are the functions [formula], respectively, and [formula] are the functions [formula]. If [formula], then a contradiction proving Lemma 6 follows immediately from Lemmas 2, 3 and 5. The same holds, if r = 2 and [formula].

Assume now r = 2 and α0,2 = 1 (the case β0,2 = 1 being similar). Let f2,1(a,z)  =  φ0,1(a,z) and f2,1,2(z) = φ0,2(z). We may proceed as in the proof of Lemma 5, but now we assume that the function f2,1,2(z) is omitted if (bh) is constant, so a2,1,1 = 0 in this case. Now [formula], and thus ([\ref=a17]) yields

[formula]

where G*i(z) = Gi(z)  (1  ≤  i  ≤  s!p  -  1) but G*0(z) = G0(z) - A2,1,0f2,1(1,z). We now define J* as J in the proof of Lemma 5, but this time A2,1,0 is replaced by 0 in this definition (thus we may have 0∈J but 0∉J*). If J* is not empty, we get a contradiction as in the proof of Lemma 5. Therefore we now deduce that Ak,m,i = 0 for all (k,m,i)  ≠  (2,1,0). Thus, [formula] and, by ([\ref=a16]),

[formula]

If [formula] is not constant, then the sequences [formula] and [formula] are linearly dependent contrary to property b) from the beginning of this section. If [formula] is constant, then a2,1,1 = 0, and hence [formula] and [formula] are linearly dependent, contrary to property a). Thus, Lemma 6 holds. [formula]

Remark 4. Similarly, by using Remarks 1 and 3, we see that the results of Lemma 6 hold also if [formula] and [formula] satisfy the conditions of Remark 1. Here the cases 3) and 4) do not occur.

Proof of Theorem 3

Assume, contrary to Theorem 3, that the numbers ([\ref=a6]) are algebraically dependent. Then there exist a finite set [formula] and a positive integer L0 such that the numbers

[formula]

are algebraically dependent (in the exceptional cases, the numbers mentioned there are removed). We shall prove that this is impossible.

From definition ([\ref=a2]) of D, it follows that [formula] and [formula] for all distinct d1,d2∈D, see [\cite=NTT]. Thus, there exist a finite subset D0  ⊂  D and a positive integer s such that [formula].

Let L be a positive integer. Assume that, for each d∈D0, we have non-zero algebraic numbers [formula] as in Lemma 6 above. If α is an algebraic number with 0 < |α| < 1, then we may choose an [formula] in such a way that [formula]. If the functions

[formula]

are defined as in ([\ref=a18])-([\ref=a20]) above, but now with summation starting from h0, then all numbers

[formula]

are defined. For these numbers we have the following

Lemma 7. Let [formula] and [formula] satisfy the conditions of Lemma 6. Then the numbers ([\ref=a22]) are algebraically independent, unless 2∈D0 and one of the following cases hold: 1) (bh) is constant and α0,2 = 1; 2) (ch) is constant and β0,2 = 1; 3) α0,2  =  ζ2,β0,2  =  ζ4; 4) α0,2  =  ζ4,β0,2  =  ζ2. In the cases 1) and 2), either [formula] or [formula], respectively, is algebraic, but all other numbers in ([\ref=a22]) are algebraically independent. In the cases 3) and 4), after removing the numbers [formula] (or [formula] from ([\ref=a22]), the remaining numbers are algebraically independent.

Proof. We apply Lemma 4 to the functions

[formula]

(In the exceptional cases 1) and 2), either [formula] or [formula], respectively, is removed. In the cases 3) and 4), [formula](or [formula] are removed.) This gives a system of functional equations of the type used in [\cite=NTT]. Further, [formula] holds for all distinct di,dk∈D0. Therefore, by [\cite=NTT], to prove Lemma 7, it suffices to show that, for given d∈D0, the functions

[formula]

are algebraically independent over [formula]. Therefore Lemma 6 immediately implies Lemma 7. [formula]

Remark 5. By using Remark 4, we similarly get the validity of Lemma 7 if the hypotheses of Remark 1 are satisfied.

By choosing L = L0 and using Lemma 7, we see that the assumption from the beginning of this section leads to a contradiction. This proves Theorem 3.

Proof of Theorems 1 and 2

It is enough to prove Theorem 2 since Theorem 1 is a consequence of it. We first note that, by using the definition of Rn and Sn, we get

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula] and [formula] do not depend on j, and [formula] and [formula] do not depend on r. We first consider the case [formula], which means that [formula] for all [formula].

Remark 6. The hypothesis [formula] in Theorem 2 is needed since otherwise [formula] for all [formula]. If (bh)  =  (ch)  =  (1), for example, this gives a dependence relation [formula].

Assume now that the numbers ([\ref=a5]) are algebraically dependent. Then there exist a finite set [formula] and a positive integer L0 such that the numbers

[formula]

are algebraically dependent (in the exceptional cases we remove the numbers mentioned in Theorem 2). As in the last section, there exist a finite subset D0  ⊂  D and a positive integer s such that [formula].

Let [formula] for [formula] if there exists some [formula] with [formula]; otherwise we choose [formula]. Let [formula], and choose h0 such that

[formula]

According to Lemma 7, the numbers

[formula]

are algebraically independent. (In the exceptional cases 1), 2), and 3,4), the numbers [formula] and [formula], respectively, are removed.) Since, by ([\ref=a23]) and ([\ref=a24]), for any r = dj,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

we get a contradiction to the assumption on algebraic dependence above. Furthermore, note that the condition [formula]  (or [formula]) is equivalent to [formula]  (or [formula]), and the conditions in 3,4) mean that α0,2 = e2πi / 3 or e4πi / 3 and β0,2  =  α20,2.

If [formula], then [formula] for all [formula]. Thus, the above deduction works also in this case, by Remark 5. This proves Theorem 2. [formula] References
