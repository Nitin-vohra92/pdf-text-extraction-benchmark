Introduction

Probably most of the readers would think that the Banach fixed principle is purely metrical in nature and has nothing to do with the ordering of vectors. To the contrary, we will exhibit an unexpected connection between the Banach fixed point principle and the Euclidean space ordered by a Lorentz cone, cone which is already well known to theoretical physicists and relatively recently to the optimization community as well (via second order cone programming), but little about this cone (if any) has been told related to fixed point theorems or vector orders. How will we do this? "To get to the icing on the cake", we need some terminology and reminders first: Let m be a positive integer, p = m + 1 and [formula] the Euclidean norm in [formula]. A cone [formula] is a closed set such that tK + sK  ⊂  K and [formula] for any [formula] [\cite=Boyd2004]. The order ≤  K induced by the cone K is defined by the equvalence [formula]. This order is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric. Moreover, ≤  K is compatible with the linear structure of [formula], that is, x  ≤  Ky implies that μx + z  ≤  μy + z, for any [formula] and any [formula]. The pair [formula] is called an ordered Euclidean space and K the positive cone of [formula]. A sequence in [formula] will be called K-increasing (K-bounded from above) if it is increasing (bounded from above) with respect to ≤  K. A lower K-bound of a set in [formula] is a lower bound of the set with respect to ≤  K. It is known that any K-increasing and K-bounded sequence from above in [formula] is convergent [\cite=McArthur1970]. Let 0 < λ < 1. A λ-contraction [formula] is a mapping [formula] such that [formula] for any [formula]. It is easy to see that a contraction can have at most one fixed point. The Banach fixed point theorem (or principle) (see [\cite=Banach1922] [\cite=Granas2003]) states that any contraction has a unique fixed point and the Picard iteration xn + 1 = F(xn) from any starting point is convergent to this fixed point. And now the "ice on the cake": Define the sequence tn by t0 = 0 and [formula] such that tn + 1 - tn to be at least [formula], or equivalently (xn,tn) to be monotone with respect to the Lorentz cone (see Example 2.3 on page 31 of [\cite=Boyd2004]) L in [formula] defined by [formula]. The construction of tn also provides the L-boundedness from above of (xn,tn), which therefore it is convergent. More details will follow in the next section.

The main result

Let m be a positive integer, L be the Lorentz cone in [formula], 0 < λ < 1, [formula] and [formula] be a λ-contraction. Consider the Picard iteration

[formula]

starting from x0, the iteration

[formula]

starting from t0 = 0 and the nonempty set

[formula]

Then, the sequence (xn,tn) is L-increasing and L-bounded frome above by any element of Ω, hence it is convergent. Its limit (x*,t*) is a lower L-bound of Ω with x* the unique fixed point of f.

First, we will show by induction that

[formula]

for any [formula]. Indeed, we have [formula] and hence (x0,t0)  ≤  L(x1,t1). Hence, the statement is true for n = 0. Now, suppose that the statement is true for n, that is, (xn,tn)  ≤  L(xn + 1,tn + 1). Hence, since f is a λ-contraction, we get

[formula]

where the second inequality follows from the induction hypothesis. From [\eqref=et] and [\eqref=eint], we get

[formula]

or equivalently (xn + 1,tn + 1)  ≤  L(xn + 2,tn + 2), that is, the statement is true for n + 1. Hence, the statement is true for any [formula].

Next, consider an arbitrary element (x,t)∈Ω. We will show by induction that

[formula]

From [\eqref=eo] we get [formula], which implies (x0,t0) = (x0,0)  ≤  L(x,t). Hence, the statement is true for n = 0. Now, suppose that the statement is true for n, that is, (xn,tn)  ≤  L(x,t), or equivalently

[formula]

Then, since f is a λ-contraction, [\eqref=et], [\eqref=eo], [\eqref=eih] and the triangle inequality imply that is the statement is true for n + 1. Hence, the statement is true for any [formula]. Taking the limit in [\eqref=eih] as n  →    ∞  , it follows that [formula], or equivalently (x*,t*)  ≤  L(x,t). Since (x,t) is an arbitrary element of Ω, it follows that (x*,t*) is a lower L-bound of Ω.
