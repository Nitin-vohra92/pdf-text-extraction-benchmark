Weak compactness of almost limited operators

Introduction

Throughout this paper X, Y will denote real Banach spaces, and E,  F will denote real Banach lattices. BX is the closed unit ball of X and [formula] is the positive part of BE. We will use the term operator T:X  →  Y between two Banach spaces to mean a bounded linear mapping. We refer to [\cite=AB3] [\cite=MN] for unexplained terminology of the Banach lattice theory and positive operators.

Let us recall that a norm bounded set A in a Banach space X is called limited, if every weak[formula] null sequence [formula] in [formula] converges uniformly to zero on A, that is, [formula]. An operator T:X  →  Y is said to be limited whenever [formula] is a limited set in Y, equivalently, whenever [formula] for every weak[formula] null sequence [formula].

Recently, the authors of [\cite=chen] considered the disjoint version of limited sets by introducing the class of almost limited sets in Banach lattices. From [\cite=chen] a norm bounded subset A of a Banach lattice E is said to be almost limited, if every disjoint weak[formula] null sequence (fn) in [formula] converges uniformly to zero on A.

From [\cite=Mach], an operator T:X  →  E is called almost limited if [formula] is an almost limited set in E, equivalently, [formula] for every disjoint weak[formula] null sequence [formula]. Note that an almost limited operator need not be weakly compact. In fact, the identity operator of the Banach lattice [formula] is almost limited but it is not weakly compact.

In this paper, we characterize pairs of Banach lattices E, F for which every almost limited operator T:E  →  F is weakly compact. More precisely, we will prove that if F is a σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice then, every almost limited operator T:E  →  F is weakly compact if and only if E is reflexive or the norm of F is order continuous (). Next, we will prove that if E is a σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice then the square of every positive almost limited operator T:E  →  E is weakly compact if and only if the norm of E is order continuous (). As consequences, we will give some interesting results.

Main results

Let us recall that a Banach lattice E is said to have the dual positive Schur property if [formula] for every weak[formula] null sequence [formula], equivalently, [formula] for every weak[formula] null sequence [formula] consisting of pairwise disjoint terms (Proposition 2.3 of [\cite=WN2012]). A Banach lattice E has the property [formula] whenever [formula] and [formula] in [formula] imply [formula]. It should be noted, by Proposition 1.4 of [\cite=WN2012], that every σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice has the property [formula] but the converse is not true in general. In fact, the Banach lattice [formula] has the property [formula] but it is not σ-Dedekind complete [\cite=WN2012].

Our first result shows that we can restrict sequences appearing in the definition of almost limited operator T:X  →  E to positive disjoint sequences if the Banach lattice E has the property [formula].

An operator T:X  →  E from a Banach space X into a Banach lattice E with the property [formula], is almost limited if and only if [formula] for every weak* null sequence [formula] in [formula] consisting of positive and pairwise disjoint elements.

The only if part is trivial. For the if part, let [formula] be a disjoint weak* null sequence. As E has the property [formula], [formula]. Using the inequalities [formula] and [formula], we see that [formula] and [formula] are disjoint weak[formula] null sequences of [formula]. So, from our hypothesis we see that [formula] and [formula]. This implies that [formula], and hence T is almost limited.

The next result follows immediately from Proposition 2.3 of [\cite=WN2012] combined with Proposition [\ref=P1].

A Banach lattice E with the property [formula] has the dual positive Schur property if and only if the identity operator on E is almost limited.

The following result shows that if a positive almost limited operator T:E  →  F has its range in a Banach lattice with the property [formula], then every positive operator S:E  →  F that it dominates (i.e., 0  ≤  S  ≤  T) is also almost limited.

Let E and F be two Banach lattices such that F has the property [formula]. If a positive operator S:E  →  F is dominated by an almost limited operator, then S itself is almost limited.

Let S,  T:E  →  F be two operators such that 0  ≤  S  ≤  T and T is almost limited. Let (fn) be a disjoint sequence in [formula] such that [formula]. As T is almost limited, [formula]. Using the inequalities [formula], we see that [formula] for all n, from which we get [formula]. Now, by Proposition [\ref=P1] S is well almost limited.

The next remark will be useful in further considerations.

Consider the scheme of operators [formula]. It is easy to see that if S is an almost limited operator, then [formula] is likewise almost limited.

Consider the scheme of operators [formula].

If R is an almost limited operator, then [formula] is not necessarily almost limited. In fact, by a result in [\cite=Wn1], there exists a non regular operator [formula], which is certainly not compact. So by Proposition 4.3 of [\cite=Mach], S is not almost limited. If [formula] is the identity operator on [formula] then R is almost limited but [formula] is not almost limited.

However, if E has the dual positive Schur property (for example, [formula]) and F has the property [formula], and S is positive, then [formula] is an almost limited operator. In fact, according to Proposition [\ref=P1], let [formula] be a positive disjoint weak[formula] null sequence. Clearly [formula] holds in [formula]. Since E has the dual positive Schur property then [formula], and hence [formula], as desired.

Our next major result characterizes pairs of Banach lattices E, F for which every positive almost limited operator T:E  →  F is weakly compact.

Let E and F be two Banach lattices such that F is σ-Dedekind complete. Then the following assertions are equivalent:

Every almost limited operator T:E  →  F is weakly compact.

Every positive almost limited operator T:E  →  F is weakly compact.

One of the following statements is valid:

E is reflexive.

The norm of F is order continuous.

[formula] Obvious.

[formula] Assume by way of contradiction that E is not reflexive and the norm of F is not order continuous. We have to construct a positive almost limited operator T:E  →  F which is not weakly compact.

Indeed, since the norm of F is not order continuous, then by Corollary 2.4.3 of [\cite=MN] we may assume that [formula] is a closed sublattice of F. As E is not reflexive then [formula] is not reflexive, and hence the closed unit ball [formula] of [formula] is not weakly compact. So, from [formula], we see that [formula] is not weakly compact. Then, by the Eberlein-mulian theorem one can find a sequence (fn) in [formula] which does not have any weakly convergent subsequence. Consider the positive operator [formula] defined byfor all x∈E. By Remark 2.4([\ref=rem]) T is an almost limited operator. But T is not weakly compact. In fact, if T were weakly compact then [formula] would weakly compact. Note that [formula] for every [formula]. So, if en is the usual basis element in [formula] then [formula] so that (fn) would have a weakly convergent subsequence. This contradicts the choice of (fn). Therefore, T is not weakly compact, as desired.

[formula] In this case, every operator from E into F is weakly compact.

[formula] By Theorem 4.2 of [\cite=Mach] we see that T is L-weakly compact, and by Theorem 5.61 of [\cite=AB3] T is well weakly compact.

By a similar proof as the previous theorem, we obtain the following result.

Let X a Banach space and F a σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice. Then the following assertions are equivalent:

Every almost limited operator T:X  →  F is weakly compact.

One of the following statements is valid:

X is reflexive.

The norm of F is order continuous.

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=T2_ess], we obtain an operator characterization of order continuity of the norm of a σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice.

Let E be a σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice. Then the following statements are equivalent:

Every almost limited operator T from E into E is weakly compact.

Every positive almost limited operator T from E into E is weakly compact.

The norm of E is order continuous.

Another consequence of Theorem [\ref=T2_ess] is the following result.

For a Banach lattice E, the following statements are equivalent:

Every positive operator T:E  →  F from E to an arbitrary infinite dimensional AM-space is weakly compact.

Every positive operator [formula] is weakly compact.

E is reflexive.

[formula] and [formula] are obvious.

[formula] Follows from Theorem [\ref=T2_ess].

The following result characterize Banach lattice E for which every positive almost limited operator T:E  →  E has a weakly compact square.

Let E be a σ-Dedekind complete Banach lattice. Then the following statements are equivalent:

Every positive almost limited operator T from E into E is weakly compact.

For every positive almost limited operator T from E into E, the operator T2 is weakly compact.

The norm of E is order continuous.

[formula] Obvious.

[formula] Assume by way of contradiction that the norm of E is not order continuous. So, by Theorem 4.14 of [\cite=AB3] there exists a disjoint sequence (un)  ⊂  E+ satisfying [formula] and 0  ≤  un  ≤  u for all n and for some u∈E+. We can now proceed analogously to the proof of Proposition 0.5.5 of [\cite=WN]. Let [formula] be of norm one and such that [formula] and let Pn be the band projection onto [formula], where [formula] is the band generated by [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] for n  ≠  m, [formula] and fn(um) = δnm. Hence the operator [formula] defined byis a lattice isomorphism from [formula] into E, where [formula] denotes the order limit of the sequence of the partial sums [formula] for each [formula]. Also, let [formula] be the positive operator defined bySo, by Remark 2.4([\ref=rem]), the positive operator [formula] defined byis almost limited. But T is not weakly compact. In fact, let [formula] for each n, and note that [formula]. Clearly T(un) = un, and hence T(xn) = xn for all n. If x is a weak limit of a subsequence of [formula], then it is easy to see that [formula] and [formula] must hold. By Theorem 3.52 of [\cite=AB3] we have [formula], and hence [formula]. But this contradicts [formula] for all n. Thus [formula] has no weakly convergent subsequence, and hence T is not weakly compact, as desired.

[formula] Follows from Theorem [\ref=T2_ess].

Finally, note that a weakly compact operator T:X  →  F need not be almost limited. In fact, the identity operator of the Banach lattice [formula] is weakly compact but it is not almost limited. However, if F has the positive Schur property, then the two class coincide. The details follow.

An operator T:X  →  F from a Banach space X to a Banach lattice F with the positive Schur property is weakly compact if and only if it is almost limited.

The if part follows from Theorem [\ref=T2']. For the only if part, assume that T:X  →  F is weakly compact. It follows from Theorem 3.4 of [\cite=CW] that T is L-weakly compact, and hence T is almost limited [\cite=Mach].
