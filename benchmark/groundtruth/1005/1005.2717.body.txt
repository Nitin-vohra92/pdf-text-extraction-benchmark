Introduction

Let F be a field. A dendriform dialgebra (see [\cite=Lo]) is a F-module D with two binary operations [formula] and [formula] such that for any x,y,z∈D,

[formula]

Let A be an associative algebra over F and λ∈F. Let a F-linear operator P:A  →  A satisfy

[formula]

Then A is called a Rota-Baxter algebra of weight λ.

The free Rota-Baxter algebra generated by a nonempty set X, denoted by RB(X), and the free dendriform algebras generated by X, denoted by D(X), are given by K. Ebrahimi-Fard and L. Guo [\cite=EG08a].

Suppose that [formula] is a dendriform dialgebra over F with a linear basis X = {xi|i∈I}. Let [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are linear combinations of x∈X. Then D has an expression by generator and defining relations

[formula]

Denote by

[formula]

Then U(D) is the universal enveloping Rota-Baxter algebra of D, where λ∈F, see [\cite=EG08a].

The study of Rota-Baxter algebra originated from the probability study of Glenn Baxter in 1960 and was developed further by Cartier and the school of Rota in the 1960s and 1970s. This structure appeared also in the Lie algebra context as the operator form of the classical Yang-Baxter equation started in the 1980s. Since then, Rota-Baxter algebra has experienced a quite remarkable renascence and found important theoretical developments and applications in mathematical physics, operads, number theory and combinatorics, see, for example, [\cite=AGKO] [\cite=Baxter] [\cite=Cartier] [\cite=E02] [\cite=EG08b] [\cite=Rota].

The dendriform dialgebra was introduced by J.-L. Loday [\cite=Lo] in 1995 with motivation from algebraic K-theory, and was further studied in connection with several areas in mathematics and physics, including operads, homology, Hopf algebras, Lie and Leibniz algebras, combinatorics, arithmetic and quantum field theory, see [\cite=EG08a] [\cite=Lo04].

In the theory of Lie algebras, the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem (Poincare [\cite=Poincare], Birkhoff [\cite=Birkhoff], Witt [\cite=Witt], frequently contracted to PBW theorem) is a fundamental result giving an explicit description of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. The term "PBW type theorem" or even "PBW theorem" may also refer to various analogues of the original theorem, see, for example, [\cite=Cohn] [\cite=Higgins].

I.P. Shestakov [\cite=Shest] proved that an Akivis algebra can be embedded into its universal enveloping non-associative algebra. M. Aymon and P.-P. Grivel [\cite=A] proved that a Leibniz algebra can be embedded into its universal enveloping dialgebra. P.S. Kolesnikov [\cite=K] proved that every (finite dimensional) Leibniz algebra can be embedded into current conformal algebra over the algebra of linear transformations of a (finite dimensional) linear space. As a corollary, a new proof of the theorem on injective embedding of a Leibniz algebra into an associative dialgebra is obtained and, more explicitly, an analogue of the PBW theorem for Leibniz algebras in [\cite=Lo].

Motivated by the above, in this paper, we prove the following theorem.

Every dendriform dialgebra over a field of characteristic 0 can be embedded into its universal enveloping Rota-Baxter algebra of weight 0. In another words, such a dendriform dialgebra is isomorphic to a dendriform subdialgebra of a Rota-Baxter algebra of weight 0.

Composition-Diamond lemma for Rota-Baxter algebras is established by L.A. Bokut, Yuqun Chen and Xueming Deng in a recent paper [\cite=BCD]. In this paper, by using this lemma, we prove the above theorem.

Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce some notations which are related Gröbner-Shirshov bases for Rota-Baxter algebras, see [\cite=BCD].

Let X be a nonempty set, S(X) the free semigroup generated by X without identity and P a symbol of a unary operation. For any two nonempty sets Y and Z, denote by

[formula]

where for a set T, T0 means the empty set.

Define

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Clearly, P(Φ(X))  ⊂  Φ(X). If [formula], then u is called prime. For any u∈Φ(X), u has a unique form [formula] where ui is prime, [formula], and ui,ui + 1 can not both have forms as P(u'i) and P(u'i + 1).

For any u∈Φ(X) and for a set [formula], denote by deg T(u) the number of occurrences of t∈T in u. Let

[formula]

We order Deg(u) lexicographically.

In the following, we always assume that F is a field of characteristic 0.

Let FΦ(X) be a free F-module with F-basis Φ(X) and λ∈F a fixed element. Extend linearly P: FΦ(X)  →  FΦ(X), u  ↦  P(u) where u∈Φ(X).

Now we define the multiplication in FΦ(X).

Firstly, for [formula], define

[formula]

Secondly, for any [formula] where ui,vj are prime, [formula], define

[formula]

Equipping with the above concepts, FΦ(X) is the free Rota-Baxter algebra with weight λ generated by X, see [\cite=EG08a].

We denote by RB(X) the free Rota-Baxter algebra with weight λ generated by X.

Let N+ be the set of positive integers.

Let the notations be as before. We have to order Φ(X). Let X be a well-ordered set. Let us define an ordering >   on Φ(X) by induction on the Deg-function.

For any u,v∈Φ(X), if Deg(u) > Deg(v), then u > v.

If Deg(u) = Deg(v) = (n,m), then we define u > v by induction on (n,m).

If (n,m) = (1,0), then u,v∈X and we use the ordering on X. Suppose that for (n,m) the ordering is defined where (n,m)  ≥  (1,0). Let (n,m) < (n',m') = Deg(u) = Deg(v). If u,v∈P(Φ(X)), say u = P(u') and v = P(v'), then u > v if and only if u' > v' by induction. Otherwise [formula] and [formula] where l > 1 or s > 1, then u > v if and only if [formula] lexicographically by induction.

It is clear that >   is a well ordering on Φ(X), see [\cite=BCD]. Throughout this paper, we will use this ordering.

Let [formula] be a symbol and [formula]. By a [formula]-Rota-Baxter word we mean any expression in [formula] with only one occurrence of [formula]. The set of all [formula]-Rota-Baxter words on X is denoted by [formula].

Let u be a [formula]-Rota-Baxter word and s∈RB(X). Then we call

[formula]

an s-Rota-Baxter word. For short, we call u|s an s-word.

Note that the ordering >   is monomial in the sense that for any [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], see [\cite=BCD], Lemma 3.4.

If [formula], then we call u|s a normal s-word.

Now, for any 0  ≠  f∈RB(X), f has the leading term [formula] and [formula] where ,ui∈Φ(X), > ui,0  ≠  α1,αi∈F. Denote by lc(f) the coefficient of the leading term [formula]. If lc(f) = 1, we call f monic.

Let f,g∈RB(X) be monic with [formula] where each ui is prime. Then, there are four kinds of compositions.

We call w in (f,g)w the ambiguity with respect to f and g.

Let S  ⊂  RB(X) be a set of monic polynomials. Then the composition h is called trivial modulo (S,w), denoted by [formula], if

[formula]

where each αi∈F, si∈S, ui|si is normal si-word and [formula], and  = w if h is a composition of left (right) multiplication.

In general, for any two polynomials p and q, [formula] means that [formula].

S is called a Gröbner-Shirshov basis in RB(X) if each composition is trivial modulo S and responding w.

([\cite=BCD], Composition-Diamond lemma for Rota-Baxter algebras) Let RB(X) be a free Rota-Baxter algebra over a field of characteristic 0 and S a set of monic polynomials in RB(X),   >   the monomial ordering on Φ(X) defined as before and Id(S) the Rota-Baxter ideal of RB(X) generated by S. Then the following statements are equivalent.

S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis in RB(X).

[formula] for some [formula], s∈S.

Irr(S)  =  {u∈Φ(X)|u  ≠  v|s̄,s∈S,v|s  s} is a F-basis of [formula].

If a subset S of RB(X) is not a Gröbner-Shirshov basis then one can add all nontrivial compositions of polynomials of S to S. Continuing this process repeatedly, we finally obtain a Gröbner-Shirshov basis Scomp that contains S. Such a process is called Shirshov algorithm.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=t1]

In this section, we assume that RB(X) is the free Rota-Baxter algebra generated by X = {xi|i∈I} with weight λ = 0.

For any u,v∈Φ(X), we have [formula].

Proof: By Rota-Baxter formula ([\ref=e2]), we may assume that [formula], where ni,mj∈N + , ui,vj∈Φ(X). Since the characteristic of F is 0, the result follows. [formula]

Denote by

[formula]

For a polynomial f = Σni = 1αiui∈RB(X), where each 0  ≠  αi∈F, ui∈Φ(X), denote the set {ui, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n} by supp(f).

Proof. 1)  We prove only the case [formula]. Another case is similar.

We use induction on [formula]. Since [formula], we have n  ≥  2.

Assume that n = 2. Then either u = xjxk or u = P(x), xj,xk,x∈X. If u = xjxk, we have [formula], and [formula]. If u = P(x), we have [formula], and [formula].

For n > 2, there are three cases to consider.

(II) u = P(u1). Then f = P(xi)u = P(xi)P(u1) = P(P(xi)u1) + P(xiP(u1)). Let [formula] and [formula], where all wi,wi'∈Φ1(X). By using Lemma [\ref=l0], [formula] and similarly, [formula] for any j,j'. Then [formula], where [formula].

(III) u = P(u1)u2, where u2 is not empty. Then [formula], and u2 = xju3 for some xj∈X since [formula]. Therefore, f = P(xi)u = P(xi)P(u1)u2 = P(P(xi)u1)u2 + P(xiP(u1))u2. For P(xiP(u1))u2, we have [formula]. For P(P(xi)u1)u2, since [formula], by induction on n, we get that [formula], where [formula]. By using Lemma [\ref=l0], [formula]. As a result [formula] and [formula].

2)  We only prove the case f = P(u)P(v). Another case is similarly to prove.

We use induction on [formula]. Since [formula], we have n  ≥  5.

Assume that n = 5. Then either u = xixj and v = x or u = P(xi) and v = x, where xi,xj,x∈X.

If u = xixj and v = x, we have [formula], and [formula].

If u = P(xi) and v = x, we have [formula], and [formula].

For n > 5, since f = P(u)P(v) = P(uP(v)) + P(P(u)v) and by Lemma [\ref=l0], it is sufficient to prove that [formula], [formula], where [formula].

For P(uP(v)), there are two cases to consider.

(II) u = u1P(u2). Then there are two subcases to consider.

For P(P(u)v), there are also two cases to consider.

The proof is completed. [formula]

Let [formula], where

[formula]

where for any u∈X*, |u| is the length of u, X* is the free monoid generated by X.

Then S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis in RB(X).

Proof.  The ambiguities of all possible compositions of the polynomials in S are only as below:

f1∈F1, f2∈F2, and w = xiP(xj)xk, i,j,k∈I.

f1∈F1, f2∈F2, and w = P(xi)xjP(xk), i,j,k∈I.

f2∈F2, f3∈F3, and [formula]. When n = 0, |u(1)0|  ≥  1.

f1∈F1, f3∈F3, and [formula]. When n = 0, |u(1)0|  ≥  1.

f3,f3'∈F3. There are three ambiguities, one is for the intersection composition and two are for the inclusion composition.

All possible compositions of left and right multiplication are: f1P(u),  P(u)f2,  f3P(u) and P(u)f3, where fi∈Fi, u∈Φ(X), i = 1,2,3.

Now we prove that all the compositions are trivial.

For [formula], let [formula], [formula]. Then w = xiP(xj)xk and

[formula]

For [formula], let [formula], [formula]. Then w = P(xi)xjP(xk) and by equation ([\ref=e1]),

[formula]

For [formula], let [formula], [formula],  [formula], and |u0|  ≥  1 if n = 0. Then [formula] and

[formula]

For [formula], the proof is similar to [formula].

For [formula], we have (f,g)w = 0.

Now, we check the compositions of left and right multiplication. We prove only the cases of f1P(u) and P(u)f3, where f1∈F1, f3∈F3, u∈Φ(X). Others can be similarly proved.

We may assume that u∈Φ1(X).

For f1P(u), let [formula] and [formula]. There are two cases to consider.

u = xk∈X. Then by using the equation ([\ref=e1]),

[formula]

[formula]. Then

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=l2], we have [formula], where [formula]. Then

[formula]

For P(u)f3, let [formula], [formula], and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=l2], we have [formula], where each [formula]. Then

[formula]

So, all compositions in S are trivial. The proof is complete. [formula]

We reach to prove Theorem [\ref=t1].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=t1]: Let [formula]. Then for any [formula], we have [formula], where r∈Rcomp,v|r  Rcomp. Then f = v|r∈Id(Rcomp) = Id(R)  ⊆  Id(S). Since S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis in RB(X), by Theorem [\ref=CDL], we have [formula] for some [formula], s∈S. That is, [formula]. So, we have that Irr(Rcomp)  ⊃  Irr(S)  ⊃  X. Since Irr(Rcomp) is a F-basis of U(D), D can be embedded into U(D). [formula]
