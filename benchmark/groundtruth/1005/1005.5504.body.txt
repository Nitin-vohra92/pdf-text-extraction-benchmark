Expanding Ricci solitons with pinched Ricci curvature

Introduction

In this paper we consider Problem 9.62 in the famous book [\cite=Cho06], which is also the unanswered question in [\cite=MD]. Namely, when n  ≥  3, do there exist expanding gradient Ricci solitons with (positively) pinched Ricci curvature? In dimension three, we settle the problem completely. Here we recall that the (positively) pinched Ricci curvature for the Riemannian manifold (Mn,g) is in the sense that

[formula]

where R and Rc are the scalar and Ricci curvatures of the metric g respectively, ε > 0 is a small constant. This concept plays an important role in the seminal work of R.Hamilton [\cite=Ham82]. We remark that the compact expanding gradient Ricci solitons are Einstein. This result is known in G.Perelman [\cite=P02]. Then we may assume that the expanding gradient Ricci soliton (Mn,g(t),φ) under consideration is complete, non-compact, and in canonical form that

[formula]

We denote by dg(x,o) the distance between the points x and o in (M,g).

We show that there are only trivial ones.

We remark that in dimension three, the curvature decay condition is automatically true [\cite=MD]. This result is used in [\cite=M]. In the dimension bigger than three, the same is true for locally conformally flat expanding gradient Ricci solitons with pinched Ricci curvature. In general, since we are studying the Ricci flow, we should have the curvature decay order as that of the Ricci curvature. This will be considered in the future.

This paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=sect2] we recall some famous results, which will be in use in section [\ref=sect3]. Theorem [\ref=thm:1] is proved in section [\ref=sect3].

We shall use r denote various uniform positive constants.

Preliminary

Before we prove our main result Theorem [\ref=thm:1], we cite the following results, which will be in use in next section. The first is

The second is

The third one is Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=B]. Roughly speaking, the result says that for the complete and non-compact (M,g), if AVR(g) > 0 and the curvature decay suitably, then it is an asymptotic manifold. We invite the readers to papers [\cite=B] and [\cite=LP] for the definitions of asymptotic flat manifold Mτ and coordinates (z) = (zi) at infinity (also called the asymptotic coordinates).

The last one is Proposition 10.2 in [\cite=LP]. Namely,

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]

We argue by contradiction. So we assume that (M,g(t)) is not flat.

Using the strong maximum principle [\cite=Shi89a] to the Ricci soliton, we may assume that the scalar curvature is positive, i.e., R > 0. Hence we know that Rc > 0. According to the arguments in [\cite=Cho06] and [\cite=MD], we know that φ is a proper strict convex function, which implies by using the Morse theory that Mn is diffeomorphic to R. Using Proposition [\ref=pro:1], Proposition [\ref=pro:2], and Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=B] we know that (M,g(t)) is an asymptotic flat manifold. We also know that

[formula]

Recall that in coordinates (zj) at infinity, we have the Ricci soliton equation

[formula]

For notation simple, we let t = 1 / 2. Then we have gij  =  φij - Rij. By Ricci pinching condition we know that Rij decay exponentially and

[formula]

Recall the Ricci formula

[formula]

This also implies that

[formula]

Hence [formula] decays in the exponent rate.

We now compute the mass. Using the Ricci formula, we have

[formula]

Using Proposition [\ref=pro:3] we know that (M,g(1 / 2)) is Rn with the Euclidean metric. A contradiction. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]. q.e.d.
