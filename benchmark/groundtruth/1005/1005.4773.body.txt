On the singular sector of the Hermitian random matrix model in the large N limit

Introduction

The Hermitian matrix (H) model is nowadays the paradigmatic model in the theory of random matrices ( see e.g. [\cite=gin] [\cite=dei]). The partition function for this model is

[formula]

where T > 0 is a real parameter which represents the temperature and the integration is performed on the space of N  ×  N Hermitian matrices. The large N limit of the H model is of particular interest since it exhibits many important universality properties. It turns out that most of the applications of the H model [\cite=gin] [\cite=dei] arise after regularizing the large N-limit solutions at their singular points (double-scaling limit method). In this sense the analysis and characterization of the singular sector of the H model is of great relevance.

The simplest situation corresponds to the so called zero genus case in which the support of the eigenvalue density reduces to a single interval

Hodograph equations and the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equations

B hierarchy

The B system [\eqref=ben] is a member of a dispersionless integrable hierarchy which describe deformations of the curve (see e.g. [\cite=kod] [\cite=km]).

[formula]

The flows

[formula]

are characterized by the following condition: There exists a family of functions [formula] satisfying

[formula]

where

[formula]

Functions S which satisfy [\eqref=kdV] are referred to as action functions in the theory of dispersionless integrable systems (see e.g. [\cite=kri]). Notice that for n = 0 Eq.[\eqref=kdV] reads

[formula]

so that the system [\eqref=kdV] is equivalent to

[formula]

and, in terms of [formula], it can be rewritten in the hydrodynamical form

[formula]

The t1-flow of this hierarchy is the B system [\eqref=ben] (t: = t1), which in terms of [formula] reads

[formula]

It was proved in [\cite=kmm] that the system [\eqref=crit] for the function

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a system of hodograph equations for the B hierarchy. Moreover, the action function for the corresponding solutions is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Obviously, WB satisfies the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation [formula]. Written explicitly, WB represents itself the series

[formula]

The hodograph equations [\eqref=crit] with tn    =    0 for n    ≥    4 take the form

[formula]

Detailed analysis of equations [\eqref=h2] will be performed in section 4.

dToda hierarchy

It is known (see e.g. [\cite=gin]) that as N  →    ∞   the asymptotic density of eigenvalues [formula] of the H model in the zero genus case concentrates on a single interval

Characterization of singular sectors

Using [\eqref=crit] and [\eqref=edpa] we may now analyze the structure of singular sectors of the B system and the H model in a unified way. Thus, let us denote by M the set of solutions [formula] of the hodograph equations [\eqref=crit]. There is a partition of M into a regular and a singular sector

[formula]

such that given [formula]

[formula]

The elements of [formula], correspond to the case when the system [\eqref=crit] is uniquely solvable and hence, it defines a unique solution [formula]. The singular sector [formula] contains the degenerate critical points of the function W on which the implicit solutions [formula] of the hodograph equations exhibit gradient catastrophe behaviour.

The Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation is of great help to analyze the structure of [formula]. Indeed, if [formula], as a consequence of [\eqref=edpa] it is clear that

[formula]

Consequently

[formula]

Thus, we have Furthermore, using [\eqref=edpa] it follows at once that at any point [formula] all mixed derivatives ∂iβ1∂jβ2W can be expressed in terms of linear combination of diagonal derivatives ∂nβ1W and ∂mβ2W. Let us now define [formula] as the set of points [formula] such that

[formula]

It is clear that

[formula]

Then, it follows at once that

According to [\eqref=trans] and using [\eqref=edpa] we have

[formula]

It is then immediate to conclude that

Singular sectors in the H model

In the applications of the H model in quantum gravity [\cite=gin] the singular sectors are described in terms of the behaviour of the eigenvalue density ρ(λ) at the endpoints (β1,β2) of its support. We will now show how this description derives in a natural way from the classification [\eqref=singp] based on the subsets [formula] of the singular sector . To this end let us consider the derivative ∂k + 1β1WH with k  ≥  2 , it is obviously proportional to the integral and a similar result follows for the derivatives ∂k + 1β2W with k  ≥  2. As a consequence we have This property is crucial to establish the relationship between the regularized singularity sectors of the H model and the minimal conformal models (p,q) with q = 2 [\cite=gin].

Singular sectors in the B system

In analogy with the H model we may characterize the classes [formula] of the singular sector of the B system in terms of the behaviour of S(λ) at λ  =  βi  (i = 1,2) . Indeed the derivative ∂k + 1β1WB with k  ≥  1 is proportional to the integral and a similar result follows for the derivatives ∂k + 1β2WB with k  ≥  2. As a consequence we have This result shows the existing duality between the eigenvalue density ρ of the H model and the S function of the B system.

Explicit determination of singular sectors in terms of constrains [formula]

The singular classes [formula] can be determined by means of systems of n1 + n2 constraints for the coordinates [formula]. To see this property notice that the points [formula] of [formula] are characterized by the equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

Furthermore, the jacobian matrix of the the system of two equations

[formula]

is not singular as

[formula]

Indeed, we notice that as a consequence of [\eqref=edpa] the derivatives outside the diagonal of Δ are linear combinations of the derivatives {∂kβi  W,  1  ≤  k  ≤  ni + 1,  i = 1,2}, so that from [\eqref=m12b]-[\eqref=m12c] we have

[formula]

Therefore, one can solve [\eqref=m12d] and get a solution [formula]. Substituting this solution in the remaining equations [\eqref=m12b] gives n1 + n2 constraints of the form

[formula]

It is not difficult to determine the solutions of [\eqref=m12b]-[\eqref=m12c] when tn = 0,  n  ≥  4. Lists of such solutions are given next.

Example: the H model

Let us consider the H model and assume that tn = 0 if [formula] . Then it follows that the condition [formula] which characterizes [formula] reads

[formula]

There are two generic classes in [formula] given by [formula] and [formula]. Assuming that (t1,t2,t3,β1,β2) must be real, both classes include two cases

[formula]

where we assume t3 < 0 in the second case.

[formula]

where we assume t3 < 0 in the second case.

Example: the B system

Let us now consider the system of hodograph equations for the B system with tn = 0 for all [formula]. Now the condition [formula] reduces to

[formula]

There are two classes in [formula]

[formula]

In the same way it follows that [formula] has two classes given by
