Reflective modular forms in algebraic geometry

Introduction

A reflective modular form is a modular form on an orthogonal group of type [formula] whose divisor is determined by reflections. A strongly reflective form that vanishes of order one along the reflective divisors is the denominator function of a Lorentzian Kac-Moody (super) Lie algebra of Borcherds type. For example the famous Borcherds form Φ12 in 26 variables (see [\cite=B1]) defines the Fake Monster Lie algebra.

Reflective modular forms are very rare. Some of them have geometric interpretation as automorphic discriminants of some moduli spaces, for example of moduli spaces of lattice polarised [formula] surfaces (see [\cite=GN5]). The first such example was the Borcherds-Enriques form Φ4 (see [\cite=B2]). This strongly reflective form is the automorphic discriminant of the moduli space of Enriques surfaces and it is the denominator function of the fake monster superalgebra. In 2009 K.-I. Yoshikawa constructed the automorphic discriminant ΦV of the Kähler moduli of a Del Pezzo surface V of 1  ≤   deg V  ≤  9. These functions are also related to the analytic torsion of special Calabi-Yau threefolds (see [\cite=Y]). The corresponding Borcherds superalgebras were predicted in the conjecture of Harvey-Moore (see [\cite=HM]). We note that the generators and relations of Lorentzian Kac-Moody (super) Lie algebras of Borcherds type are defined by the Fourier expansion of a reflective modular form at a zero-dimensional cusp (see [\cite=GN1] and [\cite=GN3]). All modular forms mentioned above were constructed as Borcherds automorphic products which gives us the multiplicities of the positive roots.

The quasi pull-backs of the strongly reflective form Φ12 help us to prove the general type of some modular varieties of orthogonal type. See [\cite=GHS1] where we proved that the moduli space of polarised [formula] surfaces of degree 2d is of the maximal Kodaira dimension if d > 61. In § 1 of this paper we give a new geometric definition based on the results of [\cite=GHS1] of the reflective modular forms as modular forms with a small divisor. It gives us a new interesting application of reflective modular forms which is quite opposite to the results of [\cite=GHS1]-[\cite=GHS2]. In Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim] we prove that the existence of a strongly reflective modular form of a large weight implies that the Kodaira dimension of the corresponding modular variety is negative or, in some special case, it is equal to zero. In § 2 we give three new examples of modular varieties of orthogonal type of dimension 4, 6 and 7 of Kodaira dimension 0 (varieties of Calabi-Yau type) and we hope to consider more examples in the near future.

The geometric examples of § 2 are based on the three towers of strongly reflective modular forms which we construct in - with the help of Jacobi lifting. It is a rather surprising fact that we obtain very simple Jacobi lifting constructions of the Borcherds form Φ4 and of the Yoshikawa functions ΦV. These modular forms constitute the D8-tower of the Jacobi liftings (see § 3). In particular we obtain simple formulae for the Fourier expansions of ΦV, i.e. the explicit generating formulae for the imaginary simple (super) roots of the corresponding Borcherds superalgebras. In § 4 and § 5 we present the towers of the strongly reflective modular forms based on the modular forms of singular weight for the root systems 3A2 and 4A1. The D8-, 3A2- and 4A1-towers of the Jacobi liftings give us 15 = 8 + 3 + 4 strongly reflective modular forms. We note that the last function in the 4A1-tower is the Siegel modular form Δ5 which is the square root of the Igusa modular form of weight 10.

In the conclusion we formulate a conjecture about strongly reflective modular forms similar to the modular forms considered in this paper.

Modular varieties of orthogonal type and reflective modular forms

We start with the general set-up. Let L be an even integral lattice with a quadratic form of signature (2,n) and let

[formula]

be the associated n-dimensional classical Hermitian domain of type IV (here +   denotes one of its two connected components). We denote by [formula] the index 2 subgroup of the integral orthogonal group [formula] preserving D(L). For any [formula] such that v2 = (v,v) < 0 we define the rational quadratic divisor

[formula]

where [formula] is an even integral lattice of signature (2,n - 1). If [formula] is of finite index we define the corresponding modular variety

[formula]

which is a quasi-projective variety of dimension n.

The important examples of modular varieties of orthogonal type are

a) the moduli spaces of polarised [formula] surfaces;

b) the moduli spaces of lattice polarised [formula] surfaces (the dimension of such a moduli space is smaller than 19);

c) the moduli spaces of polarised Abelian or Kummer surfaces;

d) the moduli space of Enriques surfaces;

e) the periodic domains of polarised irreducible symplectic varieties (the dimension of a modular variety of this type is equal to 4, 5, 20 or 21).

One of the main tools in the study of the geometry of modular varieties is the theory of modular forms with respect to an orthogonal group. In the next definition we bear in mind Koecher's principle (see [\cite=B1], [\cite=Bai]).

Let [formula] with n  ≥  3. A modular form of weight k and character [formula] with respect to Γ is a holomorphic function [formula] on the affine cone [formula] over D(L) such that

[formula]

[formula]

A modular form is called a cusp form if it vanishes at every cusp (a boundary component of the Baily-Borel compactification of FL(Γ)).

We denote the linear spaces of modular and cusp forms of weight k and character (of finite order) χ by Mk(Γ,χ) and Sk(Γ,χ) respectively. If Mk(Γ,χ) is nonzero then one knows that k  ≥  (n - 2) / 2 (see [\cite=G1]-[\cite=G2]). The minimal weight k = (n - 2) / 2 is called singular. The weight k = n =  dim (FL(Γ)) is called canonical because according to Freitag's criterion

[formula]

where [formula] is a smooth compact model of the modular variety [formula] and [formula] is the sheaf of canonical differential forms (see [\cite=F]). We say that

[formula]

For applications, the most important subgroups of [formula] are the stable orthogonal groups where [formula] is the dual lattice of L. If the lattice L contains two orthogonal copies of the hyperbolic plane [formula] (the even unimodular lattice of signature (1,1)) and its reduction modulo 2 (resp. 3) is of rank at least 6 (resp. 5) then [formula] has only one non-trivial character det  (see [\cite=GHS3]).

For any non isotropic r∈L we denote by σr reflection with respect to r

[formula]

This is an element of [formula] if and only if (r,r) < 0. If r2 =  - 2, then [formula]. In general, the ramification divisor of [formula] is larger than the union of the rational quadratic divisors Dr(L) defined by ( - 2)-roots in L.

A modular form F∈Mk(Γ,χ) is called reflective if

[formula]

We call F strongly reflective if the multiplicity of any irreducible component of [formula] is equal to one.

We note that Dr(L) = D- r(L). In the definition of reflective modular forms in [\cite=GN4] only the first condition σr∈Γ was considered. The present definition is explained by the following result proved in [\cite=GHS1]

The ramification divisors of the modular projection

[formula]

are induced by elements g∈Γ such that g or - g is a reflection with respect to a vector in L.

According to the last proposition the union of the rational quadratic divisors in the right hand side of ([\ref=eq-reflf]) is the ramification divisor [formula] of the modular projection πΓ.

Example 1 The Borcherds modular form Φ12. The most famous example of a strongly reflective modular form is Φ12∈M12(O+(II2,26), det ) (see [\cite=B1]). This is the unique modular form of singular weight 12 with character det  with respect to the orthogonal group O+(II2,26) of the even unimodular lattice of signature (2,26). The form Φ12 is the Kac-Weyl-Borcherds denominator function of the Fake Monster Lie algebra. We expect only finite number of reflective modular forms (see [\cite=GN3]). The Borcherds automorphic products give us some number of interesting examples of strongly reflective modular forms (see [\cite=B1]-[\cite=B4]). Note that for a large class of integral lattices any reflective modular form has a Borcherds product according to [\cite=Br].

As we mentioned above, if the rank of the quadratic lattice is smaller or equal to 19 then one can interpreted the modular varieties of orthogonal type as moduli spaces of lattice polarised [formula] surfaces. The stable locus of the reflections of the integral orthogonal group is related to the special singular [formula] surfaces. It gives us an interpretation of reflective modular forms as automorphic discriminants of these moduli spaces (see [\cite=GN5]). Moreover, if the modular form is strongly reflective, then the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra determined by the automorphic discriminant can be considered as a variant of the arithmetic mirror symmetry for these [formula] surfaces (see [\cite=GN6]). We remark also that the reflective modular forms of type Φ12 of singular weight with respect to congruence subgroups of [formula] were classified by N.  Scheithauer (see [\cite=Sch]).

Example 2 Igusa modular forms. We can apply Definition [\ref=def-reflf] to Siegel modular forms of genus 2 because [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] where [formula]. The Siegel modular form of odd weight [formula] and the product of the ten even theta-constants [formula] (χ2 is a character of order 2) are strongly reflective (see [\cite=GN1]-[\cite=GN2]). One more classical example is the "most odd" even Siegel theta-constant Δ1 / 2 which is a modular form of weight 1 / 2 with respect to the paramodular group Γ4. These examples are part of the classification of all reflective forms for the maximal lattices of signature (2,3) in [\cite=GN4]. Moreover, Δ5 and Δ1 / 2 are examples of modular forms with the simplest divisor (see [\cite=CG]).

Remark 1. Modular forms of canonical weight. Let [formula]. We consider F∈Mn(Γ, det ). If σr∈Γ, then F(σr(Z)) =  - F(Z). Hence F vanishes along Dr. If -  σr∈Γ, then

[formula]

and F also vanishes along Dr. Therefore any Γ-modular form of canonical weight with character det  vanishes along [formula].

Remark 2. Modular forms with small or big divisor. According to the definition above a modular form F∈Mk(Γ,χ) is strongly reflective if and only if

[formula]

i.e. the divisor of a strongly reflective modular form is small. We say that the divisor of a modular form F∈Mk(Γ,χ) is big if

[formula]

The role of modular forms of small weight (see ([\ref=wt-sb])) with a big divisor in the birational geometry of moduli spaces was clarified in [\cite=GHS1]: the modular variety FL(Γ) is of general type if there exists a cusp form of small weight with a big divisor. More exactly, we proved the following theorem called low weight cusp form trick :

Let n  ≥  9. The modular variety FL(Γ) is of general type if there exists F∈Sk(Γ, det ε) (ε = 0 or 1) of small weight k < n such that [formula].

This is a particular case of [\cite=GHS1]. We applied this theorem in order to prove that the moduli spaces of polarised [formula] surfaces and the moduli spaces of polarised symplectic varieties deformationally equivalent to [formula] or to 10-dimensional symplectic O'Grady varieties are of general type (see [\cite=GHS1]-[\cite=GHS2]).

In this paper we give a new application of strongly reflective modular forms, which is quite opposite to Theorem [\ref=thm-gt]. Namely, the Kodaira dimension of the modular variety FL(Γ) is equal to -    ∞   if there exists a modular form of big weight with a small divisor. More exactly we have

Let [formula] and n  ≥  3. Let Fk∈Mk(Γ,χ) be a strongly reflective modular form of weight k and character χ where [formula] is of finite index. By κ(X) we denote the Kodaira dimension of X. Then

[formula]

if k > n, or k = n and Fk is not a cusp form. If k = n and F is a cusp form then

[formula]

where Γχ  =   ker (χ  ·   det ) is a subgroup of Γ.

To prove the first identity of the theorem we have to show that there are no pluricanonical differential forms on [formula]. Any such differential form can be obtained using a modular form (see [\cite=AMRT] where weight 1 corresponds to weight n in our definition of modular forms). Suppose that Fnm∈Mnm(Γ, det m). We may realize D(L) as a tube domain by choosing a 0-dimensional cusp. In the corresponding affine coordinates of this tube domain we take a holomorphic volume element dZ on D(L). Then the differential form Fnm  (dZ)m is Γ-invariant. Therefore it determines a section of the pluricanonical bundle [formula] over a smooth open part of the modular variety away from the branch locus of π:D(L)  →  FL(Γ) and the cusps (see [\cite=AMRT] and [\cite=F]). There are three kinds of obstructions to extending Fnm  (dZ)m to a global section of [formula], namely, there are elliptic obstructions, arising because of singularities given by elliptic fixed points of the action of Γ; cusp obstructions, arising from divisors at infinity; and reflective obstructions, arising from the ramification divisor in D(L). The ramification divisor is defined by ±   reflections in Γ according to Proposition [\ref=prop-br-div]. Therefore if Fnm determines a global section then Fnm has zeroes of order at least m on [formula]. The modular form Fk∈Mk(Γ,χ) is strongly reflective of weight k  ≥  n hence Fnm / Fmk is a holomorphic modular form of weight m(n - k)  ≤  0. According to Koecher's principle (see [\cite=Bai] and [\cite=F]) this function is constant. We have that [formula] if k > n or Fnm = C  ·  Fmn if k = n. If the strongly reflective form Fn is non cuspidal of weight n, then [formula] cannot be extended to the compact model due to cusp obstructions (Fmn should have zeroes of order at least m along the boundary). If Fn is a cusp form of weight k = n then we can consider Fn as a cusp form with respect to the subgroup

[formula]

Then Fn  dZ is Γχ-invariant and, according to Freitag's criterion, it can be extended to a global section of the canonical bundle [formula] for any smooth compact model [formula] of FL(Γχ). Moreover the above consideration with Koecher's principle shows that any m-pluricanonical form is equal, up to a constant, to [formula]. Therefore in the last case of the theorem the strongly reflective cusp form of canonical weight determines essentially the unique m-pluricanonical differential form on FL(Γχ).

Some applications of this theorem will be given in the next section.

Modular varieties of Calabi-Yau type

The problem of constructing a strongly reflective cusp form of canonical weight (see the second case of Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim]) is far from trivial. Note that any reflective modular form has a Borcherds product expansion if the quadratic lattice is not very complicated (see [\cite=Br]) but it is rather difficult to construct Borcherds products of a fixed weight. See, for example [\cite=Ko] and [\cite=GHS1] where cusp forms of canonical weight were constructed for the moduli spaces of polarised [formula]-surfaces. Between those cusp forms there are no reflective modular forms.

There are only two examples of strongly reflective cusp forms of canonical weights in the literature. Both are Siegel modular forms of genus 2 (i.e., the orthogonal group is of type (2,3)). The first example is related to the strongly reflective modular form Δ1∈S1(Γ3,χ6) of weight 1 (see [\cite=GN4]) with respect to the paramodular group Γ3 (the Siegel modular threefold [formula] is the moduli space of the (1,3)-polarised Abelian surfaces). Then Δ1(Z)3dZ is the unique canonical differential form on the Siegel threefold [formula] having a Calabi-Yau model (see [\cite=GH]). The second example is the strongly reflective form [formula] (see [\cite=CG]) where Γ(2)0(2) is the Hecke congruence subgroup of [formula] and χ2:Γ(2)0(2)  →  {  ±  1} is a binary character. The Siegel cusp form [formula] was first constructed by T. Ibukiyama in [\cite=Ib]. A Jacobi lifting and a Borcherds automorphic product of [formula] were given in [\cite=CG], where it was also proved that the Kodaira dimension of the Siegel threefold [formula] is equal to zero. A Calabi-Yau model of this modular variety was founded in [\cite=FS-M]. Note that [formula] is a double cover of the rational Siegel threefold [formula]. One of the main purposes of this paper is to construct similar examples for dimension larger than 3.

Let S be a positive definite lattice. We put

[formula]

where S( - 1) denotes the corresponding negative definite lattice. In the applications of this paper S will be Dn, mA1 or mA2 where [formula] (m times). We define two modular varieties

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm-gt] shows that the main obstruction to continuing of the pluricanonical differential forms on a smooth compact model of a modular variety is its ramification divisor. In many case the ramification divisor of SM(S) is strictly smaller than the ramification divisor of M(S).

For odd n  ≥  3 the ramification divisor of the projection

[formula]

is defined by the reflections with respect to ( - 4)-vectors in [formula] with divisor 2 where [formula].

We recall that Dn is an even sublattice of the Euclidian lattice [formula]

[formula]

We have [formula]. The discriminant form is generated by the following four elements

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Note that [formula] is the minimal norm of the elements in the corresponding classes modulo Dn.

For any even integral lattice L with two hyperbolic planes there is a simple description of the orbits of the primitive vectors. According to the Eichler criterion (see [\cite=G2] or [\cite=GHS3]), the [formula]-orbit of any primitive v∈L depends only on v2 = (v,v) and [formula]. We note that [formula] is a primitive vector in the dual lattice [formula].

If [formula] then v2 < 0 and [formula]. Therefore, if n is impair then [formula] is a divisor of 4 because [formula]. If [formula] then v2 =  - 2 and -  σv induces [formula] on the discriminant group. (Note that [formula] on [formula] for even n.) If [formula] then v2 = 4. It follows that v belongs to the [formula]-orbit of one of vectors of type 2ei or ±  ei1  ±  ei2  ±  ei3  ±  ei4 of square 4. Any vector of type ±  ei1  ±  ei2  ±  ei3  ±  ei4 has divisor 1 in Dn for odd n > 4. If v =   ±  2ei then -  σv induces identity on the discriminant group for odd n. If [formula] and v2 =  - 4 or - 8 then (v / 4)2 =  - 1 / 4 or - 1 / 2. Both cases are impossible for odd n because [formula], 1 or [formula] for any [formula].

We have that SM(D7) is of general type and

[formula]

Moreover

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] is the binary character of the cusp form Δ4,  2A1 from Theorem [\ref=thm-liftA1].

In the proof we use strongly reflective cusp forms which will be constructed in the next sections with the help of liftings of Jacobi modular forms.

1) The divisor of the cusp form [formula] of weight 12 - n (see Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8] below) for n = 3 and 5 is equal to the ramification divisor of π+Dn. Therefore we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim]. For n = 7 the weight of [formula] is small. Therefore we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm-gt].

2) The modular variety SM(2A2) is of dimension 6. The strongly reflective cusp form [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=thm-liftA2] below) has canonical weight. The strongly reflective cusp form [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=thm-liftA2]) is of weight 4 which is the dimension of SM(2)(2A1). Therefore we can apply the second part of Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim].

Remark 1. Varieties of Calabi-Yau type. We conjecture that each of the three varieties of Kodaira dimension zero in Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim0] have a Calabi-Yau model similar to the two examples mentioned in the beginning of § 2.

Remark 2. Kodaira dimension of M(S) in Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim0]. Note that

[formula]

is a covering of order 2. The ramification divisor of M(S) contains all divisors of type Dr(L(S)) where r is any of the ( - 2)-vectors of L(S). Analyzing results of [\cite=B4] or using the quasi pull-back of the Borcherds form Φ12 (see a forthcoming paper of B. Grandpierre and V. Gritsenko "The baby functions of the Borcherds form Φ12") we can construct strongly reflective modular forms for [formula] of big weight (see ([\ref=wt-sb])) with respect to S = D3, D5, D7, 2A2 and 2A1. Therefore using Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim] we obtain that for all S from Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim0] the modular variety M(S) is of Kodaira dimension -    ∞  .

As we mentioned above [formula] is a double covering of the modular variety M(S) which is the moduli space of the lattice polarised [formula]-surfaces with transcendence lattice T = L(S) (see [\cite=N], [\cite=Do]). Therefore SM(D5) can be considered as the moduli space of the lattice polarised [formula]-surfaces with transcendence lattice T = L(D5) together with a spin structure (a choice of orientation in T). See [\cite=GHS1] where the case of polarised [formula] surfaces of degree 2d with a spin structure was considered. The Picard lattice [formula] of a generic member XD of this moduli space is

[formula]

where [formula] is the [formula]-lattice. The cases of L(2A2) and L(2A1) are similar

[formula]

[formula]

The only difference here is that SM(2)(2A1) is a double covering of the moduli spaces SM(2A1) of the lattice polarised [formula]-surfaces with a spin structure.

Jacobi theta-series and the Dn-tower of strongly reflective modular forms

We use Jacobi modular forms in many variables, the corresponding Jacobi lifting ([\cite=G2]) and automorphic Borcherds products ([\cite=B1], [\cite=B3], [\cite=GN4]) in order to describe special strongly reflective modular forms. This will give us the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-kdim0]. We see below that Jacobi forms (specially Jacobi theta-series) are sometimes more convenient to use in our considerations than the corresponding vector-valued modular forms.

Let [formula] be an integral quadratic lattice of signature (2,n0 + 2) where U is the hyperbolic plane and S is a positive definite integral lattice of rank n0 (then S( - 1) is negative definite). The representation [formula] of L gives us a choice of a totally isotropic plane in L. It gives the following tube realization H2 + n0 of the type IV domain D(L)

[formula]

with [formula] where [formula] is the positive definite scalar product on S. In the definition of Jacobi forms in many variables we follow [\cite=G2].

Definition A holomorphic (cusp or weak) Jacobi form of weight k and index m with respect to S ([formula]) is a holomorphic function

[formula]

satisfying the functional equations

[formula]

for any [formula] and any λ,  μ∈S and having a Fourier expansion

[formula]

where n  ≥  0 for a weak Jacobi form, [formula] for a holomorphic Jacobi form and [formula] for a Jacobi cusp form.

We denote the space of all holomorphic Jacobi forms by Jk,m(S). We use the notation J(cusp)k,m(S) and J(weak)k,m(S) for the space of cusp and weak Jacobi forms. If Jk,m(S)  ≠  {0} then [formula] (see [\cite=G1]). The weight [formula] is called singular. It is known (see [\cite=G2]) that [formula] depends only the hyperbolic norm [formula] and the image of [formula] in the discriminant group [formula]. Moreover, [formula].

Remark 1. Fourier-Jacobi coefficients. Let [formula]. We consider its Fourier expansion in ω

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The lifting construction of [\cite=G1]-[\cite=G2] defines a modular form with respect to [formula] with trivial character by its first Fourier-Jacobi coefficient from Jk,1(S).

We note that Jk,m(S) = Jk,1(S(m)) where S(m) denotes the same lattice S with the quadratic form multiplied by m, and the space Jk,m(S) depends essentially only on the discriminant form of S(m). Any Jacobi form determines a vector valued modular form related to the corresponding Weil representation (see [\cite=G2]). For φ∈Jk,1(S) we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the Jacobi theta-series with characteristic h and the components of the vector valued modular forms (φh)D(S) have the following Fourier expansions at infinity:

[formula]

where [formula]. This representation for a weak Jacobi form gives us the next lemma

Let f(n,l) (n  ≥  0, [formula]) be a Fourier coefficient of a weak Jacobi form φ∈J(weak)k,1(S). Then

[formula]

If [formula] then Jk,m(A1) = Jk,m is the space of classical holomorphic Jacobi modular forms studied in the book of M. Eichler and D. Zagier [\cite=EZ]. One more function, not mentioned in [\cite=EZ], is very important for our considerations. This is the Jacobi theta-series

[formula]

which is the Jacobi form of weight [formula] and index [formula] with multiplier system v3η and the binary character vH of the Heisenberg group (see [\cite=GN4]). In the last formula we put q =  exp (2πiτ) and ζ  =   exp (2πiz), the Kronecker symbol [formula] if [formula] and is equal to zero for even m, vη is the multiplier system of the Dedekind eta-function. The functional equation related to the character vH is

[formula]

The multiplier system of ϑ(τ,z) is obtained from the relation

[formula]

Therefore for any [formula] we have

[formula]

Moreover

[formula]

and ϑ(τ,  z) = 0 if and only if τ  =  λτ  +  μ ([formula]) with multiplicity 1.

The Jacobi modular forms related to ϑ(τ,  z) were very important in [\cite=GN4] for the construction of reflective Siegel modular forms and the corresponding Lorentzian Kac-Moody superalgebras. The next example shows the role of ϑ(τ,  z) in the context of this paper.

Example. Jacobi form of singular weight for D8. Let us put This is a Jacobi form of singular weight for D8. The functional equations ([\ref=theta-H]) and ([\ref=theta-SL]) give us the equations ([\ref=def-JF])-(6). Using the Dedekind η-function we can define Jacobi forms for any Dk. Let 2  ≤  k  ≤  8. We put

[formula]

Similar Jacobi forms we have for any k > 8. The construction depends only on k modulo 8. The function ψ12 - k,  Dk vanishes with order one for zi = 0 (1  ≤  i  ≤  k). Using the Jacobi lifting from [\cite=G2] we obtain a modular form [formula] of weight 12 - k with respect to [formula]. The form ψ12 - k,  Dk is the first Fourier-Jacobi coefficient of [formula]. The lifting preserves the divisor of ψ12 - k,  Dk but the lifted form has, usually, some additional divisors. Therefore we see that using a Jacobi form of type ([\ref=eq-Dk]) we obtain a modular form with respect to an orthogonal group whose divisor contains the union of the translations of the rational quadratic divisors defined by equation zi = 0 (1  ≤  i  ≤  k). This example gives a good illustration of why the language of Jacobi forms is very useful for our considerations.

For 2  ≤  k  ≤  8

[formula]

is strongly reflective. More exactly, if k  ≠  4 then

[formula]

where all vectors v in the last union belong to the same [formula]-orbit. The divisor for k = 4 is defined by the orbit of 2e1∈D4. If k < 8 then [formula] is a cusp form.

Remark 1. [formula] and [formula] are strongly reflective modular form of singular and canonical weight respectively. The modular group of the lifting is, in fact, larger. For k  ≠  4 we have

[formula]

where the binary character [formula] of [formula] is defined by the relation

[formula]

If k = 4 then the maximal modular group of [formula] is a subgroup of order 3 in [formula] (see the proof of the theorem).

We described Dk and [formula] in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem-brd]. In particular we see that [formula]. We denote the "half-integral" part of [formula] by

[formula]

The Fourier expansion of ψ4,  D8 has the following form

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

According to [\cite=G2]

[formula]

is a modular form with trivial character. The lifting of a Jacobi form [formula] (with f(0,0) = 0) of weight k was defined in [\cite=G2] by the formula

[formula]

[formula]

According to ([\ref=eq-litfJ])

[formula]

where [formula] denotes a positive integral divisor of the vector in [formula]. For example we can calculate the Fourier expansion of the modular form of singular weight

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is the maximal common power of 2 in [formula], i.e. t = 2w, n / t and m / t are integral, [formula]. Then the greatest common divisor [formula] of a vector in [formula] is an odd number and [formula].

The maximal modular group of [formula] is, in fact, larger than [formula]. The orthogonal group [formula] of the finite discriminant group is of order 2 for any [formula]. If [formula] then [formula]. The lifting is anti-invariant under the transformation z1  →   - z1 (the reflection σe1) inducing the non-trivial automorphism of [formula] if k  ≠  4. Therefore, if k  ≠  4 then [formula] is a modular form with respect to [formula] with the character [formula] defined in ([\ref=eq-maxmodgr]). If k = 4 then the permutation of the coordinates give us only the permutation of the classes of (e1 + e2 + e3 + e4) / 2 and (e1 + e2 + e3 - e4) / 2 in [formula]. Therefore [formula] is modular with a binary character for a subgroup of index 3 in [formula].

To show that [formula] is strongly reflective we consider its Borcherds product expansion. We can construct the Borcherds product using a Jacobi form of weight 0 in a way similar to [\cite=GN4]. We can obtain a weak Jacobi form of weight 0 for D8 using the so-called "minus" Hecke operator T-(2) (see ([\ref=eq-litfJ]) and [\cite=G2], page 1193). We put

[formula]

[formula]

Then φ0,  D8 is a weak Jacobi form of weight 0 and index 1. Using the Jacobi product formula ([\ref=theta-JTF]) we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

We noted above that the Fourier coefficient [formula] of weak Jacobi form φ0,  D8 depends only on the hyperbolic norm [formula] and the class [formula]. Moreover, if [formula] then [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=lem-Jf] and the representation of [formula] above). According to the Eichler criterion, the primitive vectors in [formula] with norm equal to - 1 and - 2 form three [formula]-orbits represented by the elements of the minimal norms in [formula]. Therefore the q0-term in the Fourier expansion of φ0,  D8 contains all types of the Fourier coefficients φ0,  D8 with [formula]. Using the Borcherds product construction as in Theorem 2.1 of [\cite=GN4] we obtain a modular form

[formula]

[formula]

in [formula] with the trivial character of [formula] where q =  exp (2πiτ), s =  exp (2πiω) and [formula]. Its divisors are determined by the Fourier coefficients ζ±  1i, i.e. by the vectors ±  ei∈D8 (1  ≤  i  ≤  8). According to the Eichler criterion the [formula]-orbit of any vector [formula] with v2 =  - 4 and [formula] is defined by v / 2 mod D8. Therefore any such vector belongs to the orbit of e1. We proved that

[formula]

The modular projection of this divisor on SM(D8) is irreducible. The formula ([\ref=eq-litfJ]) shows that the lifting preserves the divisor of type zi = 0 of the Jacobi form. It follows that the divisor of [formula] contains the divisor given in Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8]. According to Koecher's principle

[formula]

because they have the same first Fourier-Jacobi coefficient.

We can also use the weak Jacobi form ψ4,D8 in order to construct Borcherds products for the lattices [formula] with 2  ≤  k  ≤  8. We put

[formula]

Then [formula] is a weak Jacobi form of weight 0 for Dk. Using the same arguments as for D8 above we obtain

[formula]

If k = 4 then the divisor of the last function is smaller than the divisor in Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8]. It is defined by the [formula]-orbit of 2e1 (see the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem-brd]).

If k < 8 then the Jacobi form ψ12 - k,  Dk is cuspidal. Therefore its lifting is a cusp forms because Dk is a maximal even lattice.

Let [formula] be a Lorentzian Kac-Moody (super) Lie algebra of Borcherds type determined by an automorphic form F. Note that the generators and relations of this algebra are defined by the Fourier expansion of F at a zero-dimensional cusp. The Borcherds product of F determines only the multiplicities of the positive roots of this algebra. Therefore for an explicit construction of [formula] one has to find the Fourier expansion of F at a cusp. This explains the importance of explicit formulae for the Fourier coefficients. We give the Fourier expansion of Δ12 - k,  Dk in Corollary [\ref=cor-Fexp] below (see also ([\ref=eq-FexpD8]) and ([\ref=eq-FexpD7])).

In 1996 (see [\cite=B2]) Borcherds constructed the strongly reflective automorphic discriminant Φ4 of the moduli space on Enriques surfaces

[formula]

where χ2 is a binary character. The Borcherds products of Φ4 were given in two non-equivalent cusps (see [\cite=B3]). This function is called sometimes Borcherds-Enriques form. See [\cite=HM] for its applications in string theory. In the next corollary we obtain a Jacobi lifting construction of Φ4.

The form [formula] is equal, up to a constant, to the Borcherds modular form Φ4.

The divisor of Φ4 in D(LE) with [formula] is determined by the [formula]-orbit of a ( - 2)-vector v∈U (see [\cite=B2]). Note that a renormalization of L (L  →  L(n)) does not change the orthogonal group and [formula] for any lattice L. Therefore

[formula]

because

[formula]

These two hyperbolic lattices correspond to the two different 0-dimensional cusps of the modular variety [formula]. An arbitrary ( - 2)-vector of LE becomes a reflective vector of [formula] of length - 4. Therefore the ( - 2)-reflective divisor of [formula] corresponds to the ( - 4)-reflective divisor of [formula]. We see that the modular forms Φ4 and [formula] have the same divisor. Therefore they are equal, up to a constant, according to Kocher's principle.

The automorphic Borcherds products related to the quasi pull-backs of Φ4 appear in the new paper [\cite=Y] of K.-I. Yoshikawa. These modular forms ΦV are the automorphic discriminants of the Kähler moduli of a Del Pezzo surface V of degree 1  ≤  n  ≤  9 (compare with [\cite=GN5]). The function ΦV determines also the analytic torsion of some exceptional Calabi-Yau threefolds of Borcea-Voisin type (see [\cite=Y]).

Let V be a Del Pezzo surface of degree 1  ≤   deg V  ≤  6. The modular form ΦV of Yoshikawa is equal, up to a constant, to the modular form [formula] of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8] shows that the singular modular form [formula] is the generating function for the D8-towers of the strongly reflective modular forms of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8]. We have

[formula]

Therefore [formula] is the quasi pull-back (see [\cite=B1], and [\cite=GHS1]) of [formula] along the divisor z8 = 0. We can continue this process. Then [formula] is the quasi pull-back of [formula] along z7 = 0 and so on till [formula].

The Yoshikawa modular forms ΦV for deg V  ≥  1 also constitute a similar tower with respect to the quasi pull-backs based on the Borcherds form Φ4 (see [\cite=Y]). To finish the proof we use again Koecher's principle.

Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8] and ([\ref=eq-litfJ]) give the formula for the Fourier expansion of [formula] and ΦV. For any integral 3m > 0 we put

[formula]

We put τ0(n) = 1 if and only if n = 1.

We have the following Fourier expansion

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is an integral divisor in [formula] and we use the notation ([\ref=eq-kron]).

In the notation above we have [formula]

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq-Fexplift]) we obtain the formula of the corollary. The Kronecker symbol [formula] if  2li / d is pair. Therefore the vector [formula] belongs in fact to the odd part of [formula] (see ([\ref=eq-D8odd])) and we can divide any vector by its maximal common power of 2 in [formula]. Then we make a summation on odd common divisors like in ([\ref=eq-FexpD8]).

We note that η(τ)3 has elementary formula for its Fourier coefficients: [formula] if and only if n = N2. Therefore we have

[formula]

[formula]

The modular forms ΦV determine some automorphic Lorentzian Kac-Moody super Lie algebras related to Del Pezzo surfaces. The formula of Corollary [\ref=cor-Fexp] gives us the generating function of the imaginary simple roots of these algebras.

Remark 2. The quasi pull-back of Δ10,  D2  =  ΦV (deg V = 6) is the Siegel modular form Δ11∈S11(Γ2) (see [\cite=GN4]) where Γ2 is the paramodular group of type (1,2). Note that (see [\cite=GN4])

[formula]

Then [formula] is strongly reflective (see [\cite=GN4]). Its divisor contains two irreducible components {z = 0} and {z = 1 / 2}. The quasi pull-back of the Siegel modular form Δ11 along z = 0 is equal to the product of the Ramanujan modular forms Δ12(τ)Δ12(2ω) (in the Γ2-coordinates).

A2-tower of strongly reflective modular forms

We start with a useful general fact.

Let [formula] where Si is a positive definite integral lattice. Then

[formula]

The proof of the lemma follows directly from the definition.

In order to construct Jacobi modular forms for Dn we used the Jacobi form ϑ(τ,z) which is the denominator function of the affine Lie algebra Â1. In this section we use the denominator function of the affine Lie algebra Â2. Let [formula] where a1 and a2 are the simple roots of A2. We can rewrite this lattice in the Euclidian basis (e1,e2,e3)

[formula]

where

[formula]

The denominator function of the affine Kac-Moody algebra Â2 is associated to the holomorphic Jacobi form of singular weight 1 with character v8η of order 3

[formula]

(see [\cite=Ka] and [\cite=De]). Therefore using Lemma [\ref=lem-oplus] we can define three holomorphic Jacobi forms with trivial character

[formula]

The Jacobi lifting construction gives three modular forms of orthogonal type. In particular we obtain

[formula]

of singular weight with trivial character. For n = 2 we obtain a cusp form of canonical weight. The divisor of the Jacobi form induces a divisor of the lifting. Note that zi = 0 is the hyperplane of the reflection σλi where λi is a fundamental weight of A2 and

[formula]

where the fundamental weights are vectors of minimal length λ2i = 2 / 3 in the corresponding A2-classes. Then 3λi∈A2( - 1) is reflective ( - 6)-vector, i.e. one of the G2-roots of the lattice A2.

Let k = 1, 2 or 3. Then

[formula]

is strongly reflective and

[formula]

For k = 1 and 2 the lifting is a cusp form.

The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8]. It is enough to find a Borcherds product for the singular modular form [formula]. To construct a weak Jacobi form of weight 0 we again use the Hecke operator T-(2) of the Jacobi lifting. We put

[formula]

where

[formula]

Analyzing the divisor of ψ3,  3A2 we see that φ0,  3A2∈J(week)0,1(3A2). Moreover the direct calculation shows that

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and λi are the fundamental weights of the corresponding copies of A2. According to Lemma [\ref=lem-Jf], in order to obtain all Fourier coefficients [formula] with [formula] one has to check only coefficients with [formula]. The sum over i∈{1,2,3} in the formula above contains all such coefficients. Therefore the Borcherds product B(φ0,  3A2) is of weight c(0,0) / 2 = 3 with divisors of order 1 along all [formula]-orbits of the ( - 6)-vectors ±  λi, ±  λi + 1 and ±  (λi  -  λi + 1) (i∈{1,2,3}). Using Koecher's principle as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8] we find that

[formula]

Therefore [formula] is strongly reflective. To find a weak Jacobi for A2 and 2A2 we put

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The last modular form of weight 9 was constructed in [\cite=De]. The method of construction of φ0,  A2 in [\cite=De] was different.

Remark. The strongly reflective form [formula] (for n = 2, 3) is invariant with respect to permutations of any two copies of A2. A permutation does not change the branch divisor. It follows that the cusp form [formula] determines, in fact, two modular varieties of Kodaira dimension 0. These are the variety of Theorem 2.2 and the variety for the double extension of the stable orthogonal group [formula] corresponding to the permutation of the two copies of A2( - 1).

A1-tower of strongly reflective modular forms

In this section we use the Jacobi theta-series as Jacobi modular forms of half-integral index.

There exist four strongly reflective modular forms for L(nA1) with n = 1, 2, 3 and 4:

[formula]

where [formula]. Moreover

[formula]

and Δ6 - n,  nA1 is a cusp form if n < 4.

In the proof we construct these modular forms as Borcherds products. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8] and Theorem [\ref=thm-liftA2], the main function of this 4A1-tower is the modular form Δ2,  4A1 of singular weight. We put

[formula]

This is a Jacobi form of weight 2 and index [formula] with character v12η  ×  vH of order 2 where vH is the binary character of the Heisenberg group H(4A1). We can define the following weak Jacobi form of weight 0

[formula]

where

[formula]

The straightforward calculation shows that

[formula]

We put [formula]. In terms of this Jacobi form the Borcherds product is given by the following formula (see [\cite=GN4])

[formula]

This formula shows that Δ2,  4A1 = B(φ0,  4A1) is a modular form of weight 2 with respect to [formula] and with divisor described in the theorem. The coefficient before the exponent is the first Fourier-Jacobi coefficient of B(φ0,  4A1). Therefore the character of B(φ0,  4A1) is the binary character induced by the character of [formula]. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-liftD8] and Theorem [\ref=thm-liftA2] of this section we put

[formula]

It gives the three other strongly reflective modular forms. The last function of this 4A1-tower is the Siegel modular form Δ5, which is the Borcherds product defined by the Jacobi form

[formula]

(see [\cite=GN1]).

It is possible to get a Jacobi lifting construction of the strongly reflective modular forms of the last theorem. We can prove that

[formula]

Here we take a Jacobi lifting with a character similar way to [\cite=GN4]. This lifting gives the elementary formula for the Fourier coefficients of Δ2,  4A1 and Δ3,  3A1 similar to ([\ref=eq-FexpD8]). For example we have the following Fourier expansion of the modular form of singular weight

[formula]

[formula]

See details in the forthcoming paper of F. Cléry and V. Gritsenko "Jacobi modular forms and root systems".

Remark. The 14 strongly reflective modular forms constructed in Theorems [\ref=thm-liftD8], [\ref=thm-liftA2] and [\ref=thm-liftA1] determine Lorentzian Kac-Moody super Lie algebras of Borcherds type in a way described in [\cite=GN1]-[\cite=GN4]. The details of this construction and many other examples will appear in our forthcoming paper with V. Nikulin.

Conclusion. To finish this paper we would like to characterize the three series of the strongly reflective modular forms considered above and to formulate a conjecture on similar modular forms. To this aim we come back to the first two examples of § 1. The divisor of the Borcherds form Φ12 is defined by all ( - 2)-roots in II2,26. This is the irreducible reflective divisor in [formula]. For the Igusa modular forms the situation is different. The divisor of Δ35 is the branch divisor of the Siegel modular threefold

[formula]

containing two irreducible components. The first one π(D- 2(1)) is defined by the ( - 2)-vectors with divisor 1. The second one π(D- 2(2)) is generated by the ( - 2)-vectors with divisor 2. They are the Humbert modular surfaces of determinant 4 and 1 respectively. The divisor of the Igusa form [formula] coincides with π(D- 2(2)). This is the simplest divisor of the Siegel threefold π({z = 0}). The modular form Δ35 is not a Jacobi lifting. Its first Fourier-Jacobi coefficient is zero and the second one is equal to η(τ)69ϑ(τ,2z). See [\cite=GN2] where the Borcherds product of Δ35 was constructed. Moreover Δ35 can be considered as a "baby" function of Φ12 (see our forthcoming paper mentioned in Remark 2 of § 3). We may say that the fourteen strongly reflective modular forms constructed in § 3-§ 5 are similar to Δ5. Each of them is the Jacobi lifting of its first Fourier-Jacobi coefficient and its divisor is the simplest divisor of the corresponding modular variety. For the modular forms of the 4A1-tower, the simplest divisor is generated by the ( - 2)-vectors with divisor 2. For the D8-tower, the divisor is generated by the ( - 4)-reflective vectors, and for the 3A2-tower, it is generated by the ( - 6)-reflective vectors of divisor 3. All these divisors are complementary to the divisor defined by the ( - 2)-roots with divisor one.

We remind the following general fact. Let L be a non-degenerate even integral lattice and h∈L be a primitive vector with h2 = 2d. If Lh is the orthogonal complement of h in L then

[formula]

Therefore, det Lh for the reflective vectors considered above is smaller than det Lr for a ( - 2)-root r with [formula].

There is the second explanation why these divisors are simpler. The divisor π(Dv), where π is a modular projection, is a modular variety of orthogonal type. For reflective vectors (σv or -  σv is in Γ) they form the reflective obstruction to extending of pluricanonical forms to a compact model (see the proof of Theorem 1.5). A numerical measure of this obstruction is given by the Hirzebruch-Mumford volume of π(Dv). This volume was calculated explicitly in [\cite=GHS4] for arbitrary indefinite lattice. We can say that the divisor π(Dv) is simpler if its Hirzebruch-Mumford volume is smaller.

We would like to formulate a conjecture related to the modular forms of this paper. Let L be a lattice of signature (2,n) with n  ≥  3. We assume that the branch divisor of the modular variety FL(Γ) has several components. We suppose that there exists a strongly reflective modular forms F whose divisor is equal to the simplest reflective divisor. We conjecture that F could be constructed as an additive (Jacobi) lifting.

Note that the existence of a strongly reflective modular form implies a strong condition on the lattice (see [\cite=GN3]). The Weyl group W of the hyperbolic root system related to the simplest divisor should be arithmetic (elliptic or parabolic in the sense of [\cite=GN3]) and the root system admits a Weyl vector.
