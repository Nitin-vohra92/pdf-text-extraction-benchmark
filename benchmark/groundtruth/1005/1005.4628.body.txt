Tropical Open Hurwitz numbers

Hurwitz numbers are defined as the (weighted) number of ramified coverings of a compact closed oriented surface S of a given genus having a given set of critical values with given ramification profiles. These numbers have a long history, and have connections to many areas of mathematics, among which we can mention algebraic geometry, topology, combinatorics, and representation theory (see [\cite=ZvLa] for example).

Here we define a slight generalization of these numbers that we call open Hurwitz numbers. To do so, we fix not only points on S and ramification profiles, but also a collection of disjoint circles on S and the behavior of the coverings above each of these circles. Note that the total space of the ramified coverings we consider now is allowed to have boundary components.

We also define tropical open Hurwitz numbers, and establish a correspondence with their complex counterpart. This can simply be seen as a translation in the tropical language of the computation of open Hurwitz numbers by cutting S along a collection of circles. A decomposition of S into pairs of pants reduces the problem to the enumeration of ramified coverings of the sphere S2 with 3 critical values. In the particular case where all ramification points are simple, except maybe two of them, we recover the tropical computation of double Hurwitz numbers in [\cite=CJM].

This note is motivated by the forthcoming paper [\cite=Br9] where the computation of genus 0 characteristic numbers of [formula] is reduced to enumeration of floor diagrams and computation of genus 0 open Hurwitz numbers.

We would like to thank Arne Buchholz and Hannah Markwig who pointed out an inaccuracy in the first version of the discussion at the end of the paper.

Open Hurwitz numbers

The data we need to define open Hurwitz numbers are

S an oriented connected closed compact surface;

L a finite collection of disjoint smoothly embedded circles in S; we denote by [formula] the surface [formula];

P be a finite collection of points in [formula];

a number [formula] associated to each connected component S' of [formula]; to each circle L∈L which is in the closure of the connected components S' and S'' of [formula] (note that we may have S' = S''), we associate the number γ(L) = |δ(S') - δ(S'')|;

a partition μ(p) of δ(S') associated to each point p∈P, where S' is the connected component of [formula] containing p;

a partition μ(L) of γ(L) associated to each circle L∈L.

In this note we identify two continuous maps f:S1  →  S and f':S1'  →  S if there exists a homeomorphism Φ:S1  →  S1' such that [formula].

Now let us denote by S the set of all (equivalence class of) ramified coverings f:S1  →  S where

S1 is a connected compact oriented surface with boundary;

[formula];

f is unramified over [formula];

f|f- 1(S') has degree δ(S') for each connected component S' of [formula];

for each point p∈P, if [formula], then f- 1(p) contains exactly k points, denoted by [formula], and f has ramification index λi at qi;

for each circle L∈L, if [formula], then f- 1(L) contains exactly k boundary components of S1, denoted by [formula], and f|ci:ci  →  L is an unramified covering of degree λi.

Note that the Riemann-Hurwitz formula gives us

[formula]

where l(μ(p)) is the length of the partition μ(p) (i.e. its cardinality as a multi-set of natural numbers).

Let S be the sphere, L be a circle in S, and p1,p2, and p3 three points distributed in S as depicted in figure [\ref=sphere]a. Let us also denote by S' and S'' the two connected components of [formula] according to figure [\ref=sphere]a. We define μ(p1) = μ(p2) = μ(p3) = (2). The table below lists some values of HδS(L,P,μ) easily computable by hand. Figure [\ref=sphere]b depicts the only map to be taken into account in the second row of the table.

[formula]

If [formula], then it is clear that HδS(L,P,μ) = HδS(L,P',μ) where [formula].

Suppose that L∈L bounds a disk D which contains no point of P, and that [formula] with λi  ≠  1. Choose a point p∈D, define [formula], [formula], and extend μ at the point p by [formula] where the number of 1 we add is equal to δ(D). Then HδS(L,P,μ) = Hδ'S(L',P',μ). Here δ' is obtained from δ by increasing it by γ(L) over D.

We have to assume that λi  ≠  1 for all i in [formula] to get this identity. Otherwise, new automorphisms of coverings might appear (e.g. the first two rows of example [\ref=simple_computation]).

Note that the open Hurwitz number HδS(L,P,μ) is a topological invariant that depend only on the topological type of the triple [formula], and the functions δ and μ.

In the special case where L is empty, we recover the usual Hurwitz numbers. In particular δ is just a positive integer number, the degree of the maps we are counting and that we denote by d. We simply denote Hurwitz numbers by HdS(P,μ).

The problem of computing HdS(P,μ) is equivalent to counting the number of some group morphisms from the fundamental group of a punctured surface to the symmetric group [formula]. Hence, Hurwitz numbers are theoretically computed by Frobenius's Formula (see for example [\cite=ZvLa]).

If P  =  {p1,p2} is a set of two points on the sphere S2 with μ(p1) = μ(p2) = (d), then

[formula]

If P  =  {p1,p2,p3} is a set of three points on the sphere S2 with μ(p1) = (λ1,λ2), μ(p2) = (d), and [formula], then

[formula]

To end this section, let us mention the following nice closed formula due to Hurwitz.

If [formula] for all p in P except for one point p0 for which we have [formula], then

[formula]

Tropical open Hurwitz numbers

Tropical curves with boundary

Given a finite graph C (i.e. C has a finite number of edges and vertices) we denote by [formula] the set of its vertices, by [formula] the set of its vertices which are not 1-valent, and by [formula] the set of its edges.

By definition, the leaves of C are at infinite distance from all the other points of C. A tropical curve without any boundary component is said to be closed. Our definition of tropical curves with boundary extends the definition of tropical curves with stops introduced by Nishinou in [\cite=Nish1]. We denote by ∂C the set of the boundary components of C, and by [formula] the set of its edges which are not adjacent to a 1-valent vertex.

Since [formula], the data of the metric on C is equivalent to the data of a [formula]-affine structure on each edge of C, i.e. the data of a lattice [formula] in each tangent line of such an edge at the point p. In order to avoid unnecessary formal complications, we treat points on edges of a tropical curve as 2-valent vertices of genus 0 in the next definition.

Note that the definition implies that [formula] for a tropical morphism h:C1  →  C. The Riemann-Hurwitz condition in the previous definition comes from the classical Riemann-Hurwitz Theorem: if S1 is a genus gv oriented surface with k punctures, S is a genus gh(v) oriented surface with l punctures, and f:S1  →  S is a ramified covering of degree dh,v, then the left hand side of inequality ([\ref=RH_condition]) is the sum of the ramification index of all points of S1. In particular, it is non-negative.

The integer wh,e is called the weight of the edge e with respect to h. When no confusion is possible, we will speak about the weight of an edge, without referring to the morphism h. If wh,e = 0, we say that the morphism h contracts the edge e. The morphism h is called minimal if [formula], i.e. h does not contract any end.

Two tropical morphisms h:C1  →  C and h':C2  →  C are said to be of the same combinatorial type if there exists a homeomorphism of graphs φ:C1  →  C2 (i.e. we forget about the metric on C1 and C2) such that [formula], g(v) = g(φ(v)) for any vertex v of C1 and wh,e = wh',φ(e) for all [formula].

We depicted in figure [\ref=ex_morphism]a a tropical morphism form a rational tropical curve with five leaves and one boundary component to a rational curve with four ends. Three edges have weight 2 with respect to h. In the picture of a tropical morphism h:C1  →  C, we do not precise the lengths of edges of C1 and C since the length of edges of C and the weights of edges of C1 determine the length of edges of C1.

The sum of all local degrees of elements in h- 1(v) is a locally constant function on [formula]; if C' is a connected component of [formula] then this sum over a point of C' is called the degree of h over C'.

Note that for the morphism from Figure [\ref=ex_morphism] a) we have two connected components of [formula] as the boundary of C1 consists of a single point (the only 1-valent vertex whose image is inside an edge of C). The degree over the components of [formula] are 1 and 2.

As in section [\ref=classical], we identify two tropical morphisms h:C1  →  C and h':C1':  →  C if there exist two tropical isomorphisms Φ:C1  →  C1' and φ:C  →  C such that φ restricts to the identity map on Q and R, and [formula]. An automorphism φ of a tropical morphism h:C1  →  C is a tropical isomorphism φ:C1  →  C1 such that [formula].

Definition of tropical open Hurwitz numbers

Similarly to section [\ref=classical], we start with the following data

C a closed explicit tropical curve with [formula];

R a finite collection of points in [formula] such that any connected component of the set [formula], denoted [formula], contains a vertex of C;

Q be a finite collection of points in [formula];

a number [formula] associated to each connected component C' of [formula]; to each point q∈R which is in the closure of the connected components C' and C'' of [formula], we associate the number γ(q) = |δ(C') - δ(C'')|;

a partition ν(q) of δ(C') associated to each point q∈Q, where C' is the connected component of [formula] containing q;

a partition ν(q) of γ(q) associated to each point q∈R.

We denote by [formula] the set of all minimal tropical morphisms h:C1  →  C such that

C1 is a tropical curve with boundary;

h(∂C1)  ⊂  R;

h is unramified over [formula];

h|h- 1(C') has degree δ(C') for each connected component C' of [formula];

for each point q∈Q, the map h has ramification profile ν(q) over q;

for each point q∈R, if [formula], the set h- 1(q) contains exactly k boundary components of C1, denoted by [formula], and ci is adjacent to an edge of C1 of weight λi.

Note that the fact that h is minimal and unramified over [formula] implies that [formula] and that h does not contract any edge of C1. In particular the set [formula] is finite. Moreover the length of edges of C1 are completely determined by the combinatorial type of h. In other words, the following lemma holds.

Two distinct elements of [formula] have distinct combinatorial types.

As usual in tropical geometry, a tropical morphism h:C1  →  C in [formula] should be counted with some multiplicity. Given v a vertex in [formula] such that h(v) is adjacent to the edges [formula] of C, we choose a configuration [formula] of kv points on the sphere S2, and we define μ'(p'i) as the partition of dh,v defined by h at v above the edge ei (cf the balancing condition ([\ref=balancing])).

As in section [\ref=classical], if [formula] then δ is a number denoted by d, and we denote by [formula] the corresponding tropical (closed) Hurwitz number.

Let h:C1  →  C be the tropical morphism depicted in figure [\ref=ex_morphism]a. It is the tropical analog of the map considered in figure [\ref=sphere]. Let q1 be the image of the boundary component of C1, and q2 and q3 be the leaves of C which are image of a leaf of C1 adjacent to an edge of weight 2. We denote by C' (resp. C'') the connected component of [formula] which does not contain (resp. contains) q2 and q3, and we define δ(C') = 1, δ(C'') = 2, ν(q1) = (1), and ν(q2) = ν(q3) = (2). To compute [formula], the morphism of figure [\ref=ex_morphism]a is the only one to consider and it has multiplicity 1 so [formula] (see the second row of the table in example [\ref=simple_computation]).

Let C be a closed rational curve with four leaves. We set [formula] and ν(q) = (3) for q∈Q. Then according to figure [\ref=deg_3], we have [formula].

Indeed, for the first morphism of Figure [\ref=deg_3] we have the (classical) Hurwitz numbers at the inner vertices equal to [formula] each. In the same time the group of local automorphism at each vertex is the symmetric group [formula], so its order is 6. Finally the group of automorphisms of the morphism itself is also [formula]. Using Definition [\ref=def-multiplicity] we get [formula] as the multiplicity.

For the second morphism we have local Hurwitz numbers at the inner vertices equal to [formula] again. There are no local or global automorphisms, but there is an inner edge of weight 3. Thus we get [formula] as the multiplicity.

Let C be a genus 2 explicit tropical curve with two leaves and whose combinatorial type is as in figure [\ref=gen_2]. We set [formula] and ν(q) = (2) for q∈Q. Then according to figure [\ref=gen_2], we have [formula].

Suppose that q∈R is on an end with an adjacent leaf q' not in Q, and that [formula] with λi  ≠  1. Define [formula], [formula], and [formula] where the number of 1 we add is equal to δ((qq')). Then [formula], where δ' is obtained from δ by increasing it by γ(q) over (qq'). This is the tropical counterpart of the identity described in example [\ref=L_to_P]. Note that as in example [\ref=L_to_P], we have to assume that λi  ≠  1 for all i in [formula] otherwise new automorphisms of coverings might appear (e.g. Figures [\ref=ex_morphism]a and b which are the tropical analogs of the morphisms corresponding to the first two rows of example [\ref=simple_computation]).

Let us relate these tropical open Hurwitz numbers to the open Hurwitz numbers we defined in section [\ref=classical]. Let C be a tropical curve as in definition [\ref=def-multiplicity] with the data introduced at the beginning of this subsection. Let S be an oriented connected compact closed surface whose genus is the genus of C. We choose a collection L  =  {Lq}q∈R of disjoint smoothly embedded circles in S such that there is a natural correspondence C'  →  S'C' between the connected components of [formula] and [formula] which preserves incidence relations and such that b1(C') = g(C'S'). For each point q∈Q, we choose a point pq∈S'C' where C' is the connected component of [formula] containing q, such that pq  ≠  pq' for q  ≠  q' (see figure [\ref=dual_graph] for an example). Finally we define [formula], δ(S'C') = δ(C'), μ(Lq) = ν(q), and μ(pq) = ν(q).

For any δ,R,Q, and ν, one has

[formula]

The proof is quite straightforward: there exists a natural surjection [formula], and for any element h:C1  →  C we have

[formula]

Note that according to examples [\ref=L_to_P] and [\ref=L_to_P_trop], we may suppose that [formula].

Let us construct the map φ. For this we choose a configuration R' of points lying in the edges of C such that each edge in [formula] contains exactly one point of [formula], and we define [formula]. For each point q in R', we choose a smoothly embedded circle Lq in S such that [formula] if [formula], such that there is a natural correspondence C'  →  S'C' between the connected components of [formula] and [formula] which preserves incidence relations, and such that all connected components of [formula] have genus 0. Note that C is a realisation of the dual graph of the decomposition of S induced by [formula], and that a connected component of [formula] cannot be a disk since [formula].

Let f:S1  →  S be an element of S, and let us denote [formula]. We construct a graph C1 in the following way

to each connected component S1' of [formula] corresponds a vertex vS1' in [formula]; we set gvS1' to be equal to the genus of S1';

to each circle L in [formula] adjacent to the connected components S1' and S1'' of [formula] corresponds an edge eL in [formula] joining vS1' and vS1'';

to each connected component L of ∂S1 adjacent to the connected component S1' of [formula] correspond a boundary point vL in ∂C1 and an edge eL joining vL to vS1'.

For each circle L in [formula], we denote by w(eL) the degree of the unramified covering f|L:L  →  f(L). There exists a unique tropical structure on C1 and a unique tropical morphism h:C1  →  C such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We define φ(f) = h.

Now it remains us to prove that [formula] for any h:C1  →  C in [formula]. For this, we reconstruct elements in φ- 1(h) step by step, taking care of automorphisms.

The tropical curve C1 induces a structure of reducible tropical curve on the topological closure [formula] of [formula]. Note that to any vertex v in [formula] corresponds a connected component of [formula]. The tropical morphism h:C1  →  C induces a reducible tropical morphism [formula]. For each vertex v in [formula] adjacent to the edges [formula], we choose an unramified covering fv:S'1,v  →  S'f(v) of degree dh,v where S'1,v is a surface with boundary components [formula] of genus gv , and fv|Li is a degree wf,ei unramified covering from Li to Lq where [formula]. Let us set [formula], and let [formula] be the map defined by [formula] for any v in [formula]. The union of all maps [formula] constructed in this way (up to equivalence) is a finite set A0, and we clearly have (in the notation of Definition [\ref=def-multiplicity])

[formula]

To get an element f:S1  →  S of S, it remains to glue all the coverings fv according to the edges in [formula]. Suppose we already have performed these gluings according to s edges in [formula] and obtained a set As of coverings of S, and that we want now to glue elements of As along the edge e in [formula]. Since we can identify in exactly d different ways two degree d unramified coverings of the circle by the circle, we have wh,e different ways to perform this gluing given an element [formula] of As. We denote by [formula] the coverings of S constructed in this way. Let [formula]. Any automorphism [formula] fixing globally the two boundary components of [formula] corresponding to e extends to an equivalence of coverings [formula] for some j. The homeomorphism φi is in [formula] if i = j, and identify the two coverings [formula] et [formula] otherwise. Hence at the end of this gluing procedure, we obtain a set [formula] and we have

[formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=unique], the set [formula] is exactly φ- 1(h) so the Theorem is proved.

We can allow points with ramification profile [formula] in [formula], and recover in this way results from [\cite=CJM]. Suppose that C is trivalent, and that there exists q∈Q with [formula]. Let e be the end of C adjacent to q, and v be the other vertex adjacent to e. We denote by [formula] the edges of C1 in h- 1(e), and by [formula]. By assumption on ν(q), one of the edges ej, say e1, has weight 2 while the other edges ej have weight 1. Suppose that e1 is adjacent to v1. The Riemann-Hurwitz condition implies that all vertices vj are (dh,vj + 2)-valent vertices of C1, so the vertex v1 (resp. vj, j  ≥  2) has exactly 3 (resp. 2) adjacent edges not mapped to e. Now according to Examples [\ref=simplify], [\ref=elem1], and [\ref=elem2] we have

[formula]

The contraction π:C  →  C0 of e induces a contraction π1:C1  →  C2 and a tropical morphism h':C2  →  C0 such that [formula]. Moreover, all points in h'- 1(π(q)) lie in the interior of edges of C2, except one point which is a trivalent vertex of C2 (see figure [\ref=contraction]). We also have

[formula]

So if C is rational, [formula], and all points p∈P satisfy [formula] except maybe two of them, by contracting all the points q∈Q with [formula] we find ourselves in the situation discussed in [\cite=CJM]. In particular, we recover the same multiplicities in all cases except for example [\ref=elem1] (in this special case, the tropical computation from [\cite=CJM] is wrong).

The result of this sequence of contractions in the case of the tropical morphism depicted in figure [\ref=ex_morphism] a) is depicted in figure [\ref=contraction].
