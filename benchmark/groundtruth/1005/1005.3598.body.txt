Nonexistence of exceptional imprimitive Q-polynomial association schemes with six classes

Introduction

Distance-regular graphs have been extensively studied. They form the class of metric (or P-polynomial) association schemes, and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. Cometric (or Q-polynomial) association schemes are the "dual version" of distance-regular graphs. Besides their importance in the theory of association schemes, cometric schemes are of particular interest because of their connections, e.g., to combinatorial/spherical designs, (Euclidean) lattices and also mutually unbiased bases in quantum information theory. For recent activity on cometric schemes and related topics, see [\cite=BB2009EJC] [\cite=MT2009EJC] [\cite=DMM2010pre] and the references therein.

Major theorems concerning distance-regular graphs often have their counterparts for cometric schemes, but the proofs can be very different in terms of both techniques and difficulties; compare, e.g., the proofs of the long-standing Bannai-Ito Conjecture and its dual [\cite=BDKM2009pre] [\cite=MW2009EJC]. It is a well-known elementary fact [\cite=BI1984B] that an imprimitive distance-regular graph with valency k > 2 is bipartite or antipodal. On the cometric side, Suzuki [\cite=Suzuki1998JACa] did show in 1998 that an imprimitive cometric scheme with first multiplicity m > 2 and with more than six classes is Q-bipartite or Q-antipodal, but there remained two cases of open parameter sets with four and six classes, respectively. The exceptional case with four classes has recently been ruled out by Cerzo and Suzuki [\cite=CS2009EJC]. In this paper, we finally show that the other case with six classes does not occur (Theorem [\ref=d=6_does_not_occur]). Hence Suzuki's theorem now exactly mirrors the result for imprimitive distance-regular graphs.

The contents of the paper are as follows. §§[\ref=sec:_association_schemes], [\ref=sec:_imprimitive_cometric_schemes] review basic terminology, notation and facts concerning cometric schemes and their imprimitivity. §§[\ref=sec:_Q]-[\ref=sec:_proof] are concerned with the exceptional imprimitive cometric scheme with six classes. §[\ref=sec:_Q] deals with the description of its eigenmatrix, and §[\ref=sec:_p161+1] with the calculation of a structure constant. The nonexistence of the scheme is established in §[\ref=sec:_proof].

Association schemes

In this section and the next, we recall necessary definitions and results. The reader is referred to [\cite=BI1984B] [\cite=BCN1989B] [\cite=MT2009EJC] for more background material.

Let X be a finite set and [formula] a set of symmetric binary relations on X. For each i, let Ai be the adjacency matrix of the graph (X,Ri). The pair (X,R) is a symmetric association scheme with d classes if

By (AS1) and (AS3), the vector space [formula] spanned by the Ai is an algebra; this is the Bose-Mesner algebra of (X,R). Note that [formula] is semisimple as it is closed under conjugate transposition, so that it has a basis consisting of the primitive idempotents [formula], i.e., EiEj  =  δijEi, [formula]. By (AS2), [formula] is closed under entrywise multiplication, denoted [formula]. The Ai are the primitive idempotents of [formula] with respect to [formula], i.e., [formula], [formula].

We define phij, qhij [formula] by the equations The phij are nonnegative integers. On the other hand, since each [formula] (being a principal submatrix of [formula]) is positive semidefinite, it follows that the qhij are real and nonnegative. The eigenmatrices P, Q are defined by Note that [formula] give the eigenvalues of Ai. Let It follows that ki is the valency of (X,Ri) and [formula]. The mi are called the multiplicities of (X,R).

We say that (X,R) is primitive if the graphs (X,Ri) [formula] are connected, and imprimitive otherwise. Let Ir (resp. Jr) denote the r  ×  r identity (resp. all ones) matrix. Then

The following are equivalent:

(X,R) is imprimitive.

There are [formula] such that [formula] for some integers [formula] and an ordering of X.

Moreover, if (i), (ii) hold then [formula] and [formula].

See, e.g., [\cite=BI1984B]. Suppose now that (X,R) is imprimitive, so that [formula] is an equivalence relation on X. Then there is a natural structure of a symmetric association scheme (,) on the set [formula] of all equivalence classes, called a quotient scheme of (X,R). Let [formula] be as in (ii) above. The Bose-Mesner algebra [formula] of (,) is canonically isomorphic to the "Hecke algebra" [formula] (which is also an ideal of [formula]); to be more precise, the primitive idempotents {Ẽi}i∈J of [formula] are indexed by J and satisfy [formula] (i∈J), and for every i ([formula]) we have [formula] for some adjacency matrix Ã of (,).

Imprimitive cometric schemes

We say that (X,R) is cometric (or Q-polynomial) with respect to the ordering {Ei}di = 0 if for each i [formula] there is a polynomial v*i with degree i such that Qji = v*i(Qj1) [formula]. Such an ordering is called a Q-polynomial ordering. Note that (X,R) is cometric with respect to the above ordering if and only if for all i,j,h [formula] we have qhij = 0 if i + j < h and qhij  ≠  0 if i + j = h. Suppose now that (X,R) is cometric and set It follows that In fact, the qhij are entirely determined by the Krein array The v*i are also determined recursively:

[formula]

Moreover, if we formally define v*d + 1 by [\eqref=recurrence] with i = d and c*d + 1 = 1, then we find

[formula]

It is well known [\cite=BI1984B] that an imprimitive distance-regular graph with valency k > 2 is bipartite or antipodal. On the cometric side, Suzuki proved

If (X,R) is an imprimitive cometric scheme with Q-polynomial ordering {Ei}di = 0 and m > 2, then at least one of the following holds:

(X,R) is Q-bipartite: a*i = 0 for [formula].

(X,R) is Q-antipodal: b*i = c*d - i for [formula], except possibly [formula].

d = 4 and ι*(X,R) = {m,m - 1,1,b*3;1,c*2,m - b*3,1}.

d = 6 and ι*(X,R) = {m,m - 1,1,b*3,b*4,1; 1,c*2,m - b*3,1,c*5,m}, where a*2  =  a*4  +  a*5.

It should be remarked that, with the notation of Lemma [\ref=lem:imprimitivity], the cases (i)-(iv) above correspond to [formula], J  =  {0,d}, J  =  {0,3} and J  =  {0,3,6}, respectively. Case (iii) in the theorem has recently been ruled out by Cerzo and Suzuki [\cite=CS2009EJC] based on the integrality conditions of the Pij. In this paper, we prove

Case (iv) in Theorem [\ref=classification] does not occur. In particular, an imprimitive cometric scheme with m > 2 is Q-bipartite or Q-antipodal.

Discussions: Q

For the rest of this paper, we shall always assume that we are in case (iv) of Theorem [\ref=classification], so that (X,R) is a cometric scheme with six classes and Krein array Note that This section is devoted to the description of Q. First, we routinely obtain

[formula]

We now describe the Qi1 [formula].

Concerning [\eqref=v*_d+1], it follows that

[formula]

By definition, Eliminating v*6,v*5 we find

[formula]

Now the result follows from a straightforward calculation.

Let xi = Qi1 ([formula]). We may assume x0 = m, x6 =  - 1, and x1,x2,x3 (x1 > x2 > x3) are the roots of

[formula]

and x4,x5 (x4 > x5) are the roots of In particular, x1,x2,x3 satisfy

[formula]

The value of the left-hand side in [\eqref=cubic_factor] at x = m - 1 equals - mc*2 - a*5c*3 < 0, from which it follows that

[formula]

The other five columns of Q are determined by the recursion [\eqref=recurrence]:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]. In particular:

[formula]

It should be remarked that the validity of [\eqref=Q] can be checked by the formula [formula], where B*1 is the tridiagonal matrix defined by (B*1)ij = qj1i (cf. [\cite=BI1984B]).

Discussions: p116 + 1

The section is devoted to the computation of p116 + 1. It should be remarked that there is a formula which expresses the phij as rational functions of the Qij (see [\cite=BI1984B]). However, the required calculation turns out to be extremely involved, so that we provide a more conceptual (computer-free) approach looking at the quotient scheme (,).

We have J  =  {0,3,6} with the notation of Lemma [\ref=lem:imprimitivity], so that (,) has two classes. Since [formula] by [\eqref=Q] and [\eqref=|X|], we find I  =  {0,6} and Note also that E0,E3,E6 are linear combinations of A0 + A6,A1 + A2 + A3,A4 + A5. Hence we may write where Ã,Ã' are the nontrivial adjacency matrices of (,). Let k be the valency of the graph corresponding to Ã. Then

The following hold:

k1 + k2 + k3 = k(m + 1).

k1x1 + k2x2 + k3x3 = 0.

k1x21 + k2x22 + k3x23 = km(m + 1).

(i) is the (constant) row sum of [formula]. For (ii), observe

[formula]

Since b*3c*2 + b*4c*3 > 0 we obtain (ii), as well as k4x4 + k5x5 = 0; the latter, together with (PQ)02 = 0 and (i) above, implies (iii).

Solving (i)-(iii) above for k1,k2,k3 we routinely obtain, in particular, Note that A1 has constant row sum k1 = k(p116 + 1), from which it follows that

[formula]

Moreover, using [\eqref=x1+x2+x3], [\eqref=x1x2+x1x3+x2x3] we obtain

Proof of Theorem [\ref=d=6_does_not_occur]

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=d=6_does_not_occur].

Suppose first p116 = 0. Then [\eqref=p161+1]-[\eqref=denominator] would imply

[formula]

However, since this contradicts [\eqref=m-1<x1<m]. Hence [formula].

Fix a scalar α satisfying Since [formula], by [\eqref=p161+1]-[\eqref=denominator] we find or equivalently,

[formula]

On the other hand, since [formula] it follows from [\eqref=cubic_factor] that Multiplying both sides by [formula] we find

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=1st_inequality], [\eqref=2nd_inequality] we find from which it follows that However, since the right-hand side above is negative, this is absurd. The proof is complete.
