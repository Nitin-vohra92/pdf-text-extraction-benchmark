Introduction

According to the Einsteinian General Theory of Relativity (GTR), the Lense-Thirring precession of the longitude of the ascending node Ω of a test particle orbiting a central, slowly rotating body of mass M and angular momentum S is [\citep=LT]

[formula]

where G is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, c is the speed of light in vacuum, a,e are the semimajor axis and the eccentricity, respectively, of the test particle's orbit; note that eq. ([\ref=ltnodo]) does not depend on the inclination I of the orbit to the central body's equator. The Lense-Thirring effect is a consequence of the fact that, in its weak-field and slow-motion approximation, the Einstein's field equations of GTR get linearized, thus resembling the linear equations of the Maxwellian electromagnetism. In such a framework, analogously to the magnetic field induced by electric currents acting on a moving electric charge through the Lorentz force, mass-energy currents like those of an isolated rotating mass generate a gravitomagnetic field in the space surrounding it which acts on a moving test particle with a non-central, Lorentz-like force perturbing its Keplerian motion.

Attempts to detect the Lense-Thirring node precessions in the gravitational field of the Earth have been performed so far with the passive geodetic LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites [\citep=Ciu09] tracked with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technique [\citep=SLR]; a total accuracy of the order of approximately 10% is claimed [\citep=Ciu09]. A further LAGEOS-like SLR target, named LARES, should be launched in late 2011 with a VEGA rocket [\citep=Ciu09]; its proponent claims that, in conjunction with the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, it will be able to reach a ≈  1% accuracy in measuring the Lense-Thirring effect [\citep=Ciu09]. The values of the relevant orbital parameters and of the Lense-Thirring node precessions for LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES are in Table [\ref=OSIGNUR]. They amount to a few ten-hundred milliarcseconds per year (mas yr- 1 in the following) corresponding to linear shifts of about 2 - 5 m per year at their altitudes.

Actually, the nodes of such satellites are affected by much larger secular precessions [formula] induced by the even ([formula]) zonal (m = 0) harmonic coefficients [formula] of the multipolar expansion of the Newtonian part of the terrestrial gravitational potential which account for the departures from spherical symmetry of the Earth because of its diurnal rotation [\citep=Tap]. The even zonal harmonics, defined as [formula] in terms of the normalized Stokes coefficients [formula] [\citep=Tap], are directly estimated as solve-for parameters in global Earth's gravity field solutions obtained by processing huge data sets from dedicated satellite-based mission like CHAMP and, especially, GRACE. The most effective even zonals in perturbing the satellites' nodes are the low-degree ones; the coefficients [formula] of the node precessions for [formula] are [\citep=Ciu96] [\citep=Ior03]

[formula]

where [formula] is the satellite's Keplerian mean motion and R is the mean equatorial radius of the central body; contrary to the Lense-Thirring precession of eq. ([\ref=ltnodo]), the classical precessions of eq. ([\ref=cf4]) depend on the inclination I. The node precessions due to the first even zonal J2 for LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES are listed in Table [\ref=OSIGNUR2]. It can be noted that they are 7 orders of magnitude larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions of Table [\ref=OSIGNUR].

Thus, suitable linear combinations of the nodes of more than one satellite have been set up in order to purposely cancel out, by construction, the impact of one or more even zonals according to a strategy put forth by [\citet=Ciu96]. In particular, the tests performed so far have been conducted with the following LAGEOS-LAGEOS II combination [\citep=IorioMGM]

[formula]

where

[formula]

The future combination involving LARES as well, designed to remove the effect of J2 and J4, is [\citep=IorioNA]

[formula]

in which

[formula]

It is analogous to the combination of the nodes of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II and the perigee ω of LAGEOS II [\citep=Ciu96] used in the earlier tests [\citep=Ciu98]: the coefficients of the precessions of the perigee of LAGEOS II have to be replaced by those of the precessions of the node of LARES. Table [\ref=OSIGNUR], eq. ([\ref=cf4]), eq. ([\ref=coff]), and eq. ([\ref=cofis]) yield the numerical values of c1,k1,k2 shown in Table [\ref=OSIGNUR3]. Table [\ref=OSIGNUR3], eq. ([\ref=combi]) and eq. ([\ref=combilares]) yield 47.8 mas yr- 1 and 50.8 mas yr- 1, respectively, for the predicted Lense-Thirring combined precessions. The LAGEOS-LAGEOS II combination of eq. ([\ref=combi]) is fully affected by the node precessions of degree higher than 2, i.e. [formula]; instead, the LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES combination of eq. ([\ref=combilares]) will be fully impacted by the even zonals of degree higher than 4, i.e. [formula]. A realistic evaluation of the systematic uncertainty induced by the mismodeling in such uncanceled even zonals on the predicted Lense-Thirring signals has been the subject of several recent studies summarized in [\citet=Iorio09]. Concerning the present-day LAGEOS-LAGEOS II tests [\citep=Iorio09], the total accuracy may be up to 2 - 3 times larger than claimed by [\citet=Ciu09]; in the case of the future tests involving LARES, both gravitational [\citep=Iorio09] and non-gravitational [\citep=IorioAPPB] mismodeled perturbations should likely impact the mission at a level larger than the claimed 1%.

In this paper we want to deal with another, subtle issue pertaining the systematic bias induced by the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential. Indeed, all the studies performed so far relied upon the assumption of a perfect cancelation of J2 by the combinations of eq. ([\ref=combi]) and eq. ([\ref=combilares]). Actually, it depends on the accuracy with which their coefficients c1,k1,k2 can be known; given the huge magnitude of the nominal J2-induced precessions of Table [\ref=OSIGNUR2] with respect to the gravitomagnetic ones of Table [\ref=OSIGNUR], it has to be quite high to really allow for a measurement with a given level of uncertainty X%. Instead, until now, the coefficients of the combinations of eq. ([\ref=combi]) and eq. ([\ref=combilares]) have always been computed with a few decimal digits. In other words, one has to evaluate

[formula]

and

[formula]

as further sources of systematic uncertainty with respect to the combined Lense-Thirring precessions

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=due] we will deal with the ongoing LAGEOS-LAGEOS II tests. The LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES case will be tackled in Section [\ref=tre], while Section [\ref=quattro] contains the summary and the conclusions.

The LAGEOS-LAGEOS II case

The coefficient c1 of eq. ([\ref=coff]) actually depends on the semimajor axes, the eccentricities and the inclinations of both LAGEOS and LAGEOS II. Thus, the accuracy with which it is possible to know it is set by the uncertainties in such Keplerian orbital elements. They are not directly measurable quantities being, instead, computed from the satellite's state vectors [formula] and [formula] whose components are, in turn, estimated in a least-square sense by processing the differences between the observed and calculated ranges at different times [\citep=Tap].

Let us, now, consider in detail how to assess the uncertainty in the semimajor axis a due to a key geodetic parameter, i.e. the Earth's gravitational parameter GM which must be assumed as known to pass from the state vector to the Keplerian orbital elements. For a Keplerian orbit the semimajor axis is given by

[formula]

where r and v are the satellite's geocentric distance and speed, respectively. Thus, the relative uncertainty in a due to GM is

[formula]

Averaging over one orbital period [formula] by means of

[formula]

it turns out that

[formula]

Since [\citep=IERS]

[formula]

the average uncertainties in the semimajor axes of LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES are of the order of

[formula]

An issue is that the Earth's gravitational parameter GM is estimated by processing long SLR data sets in which just LAGEOS and LAGEOS II play a fundamental role [\citep=Dunn]. Moreover, the gravitomagnetic field of the Earth has never been accounted for in the solutions yielding GM produced so far, so that a twofold source of a-priori "imprinting" of the Lense-Thirring itself is present in the values of the Earth's GM adopted. It would be necessary to use figures obtained without including data from SLR targets, especially LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, although they may be less accurate.

Actually, the total, realistic uncertainty in a should be even larger because of r and v entering eq. ([\ref=sma]). Indeed, concerning the uncertainty in r, it includes the cm-  level accuracy in the station-  satellite range ρ and the uncertainty in the geocenter-  station position Rsta, of the order of about 1 - 2 cm [\citep=STA]. Anyway, in future calculation we will use the values of eq. ([\ref=da]).

Concerning the LAGEOS-LAGEOS II combination of eq. ([\ref=combi]) used for the present-day tests, the uncertainty in its coefficient c1 can be conservatively evaluated as

[formula]

If, together with eq. ([\ref=da]) for the uncertainties in the semimajor axes, we assume a reasonable and realistic value for the uncertainties in the inclinations of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, i.e. δI = 0.5 mas, eq. ([\ref=savc1]) yields

[formula]

corresponding to a residual J2 bias (see Table [\ref=OSIGNUR2])

[formula]

and, thus to a percent uncertainty in the Lense-Thirring combined signal of 23%. Instead, if we consider δIL = 30 μas, δIL II = 10 μas claimed by [\citep=Ciu09] we have

[formula]

yielding an uncanceled J2 signal (see Table [\ref=OSIGNUR2])

[formula]

which corresponds to a percent uncertainty of 14%.

These results show that the issue of the imperfect cancelation of the largest node precessions due to J2 cannot be neglected in the evaluation of the total error budget, especially because the previous figures have to be added to those accounting for the mismodeling in the other even zonal harmonics of higher degree fully impacting the combination of eq. ([\ref=combi]).

The LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES case

The case of the LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES combination of eq. ([\ref=combilares]) can be treated in a similar way. [\citet=IorioAPPB] preliminarily dealt with it by considering the impact of aLR and ILR only on k2. Instead, one has to fully take into account the uncertainties of the orbital elements of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II as well in both k1 and k2 according to

[formula]

By using eq. ([\ref=da]) for δa and assuming δI = 0.5 mas for LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES, the uncertainties in k1 and k2 are

[formula]

which yield an uncanceled J2 signal

[formula]

It corresponds to 29% of the combination of the Lense-Thirring node precessions. If, instead, in addition to eq. ([\ref=da]) one adopts δIL = 30 μas, δIL II = 10 μas [\citep=Ciu09] and, say, δILR = 20 μas the uncertainties in k1 and k2 are

[formula]

They yield a residual J2 signature

[formula]

amounting to 16% of the predicted Lense-Thirring trend.

Concerning the imperfectly canceled J4 signal, it turns out that it is of no concern amounting to 0.006 - 0.008 mas yr- 1.

Thus, independently of the lingering uncertainty in how to realistically assess the bias due to the mismodeling in the uncanceled even zonal harmonics of higher degree impacting in full the combination of eq. ([\ref=combilares]), the imperfect removal of the effect of J2 alone is sufficient to make dubious the achievement of the goal of a ≈  1% total accuracy in the future LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES tests.

Summary and conclusions

One of the major sources of systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precessions of the nodes Ω of the laser-tracked LAGEOS-type satellites in the gravitational field of the Earth is given by the much larger competing classical node precessions induced by the even zonal harmonic coefficients [formula] of the expansion in multipoles of the non-spherically symmetric terrestrial gravitational potential. The strategy followed so far to partially circumvent such an issue consisted of suitably designing linear combinations of the nodes of more than one satellite to cancel out, by construction, the effects of J2, as in the ongoing LAGEOS-LAGEOS II test, and of J4 as well, as in the future LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-LARES scenario. In addition to the usual systematic uncertainty due to the mismodeling in the even zonals of higher degree which fully impact such combinations, another source of non-negligible uncertainty of gravitational origin has to be taken into account. It is due to the imperfect cancelation of the effects of J2 because of the uncertainty in the coefficients entering the combinations set up just to remove it. Indeed, the numerical values of such coefficients, released with just a few decimal digits so far, explicitly depend on the numerical values of the semimajor axes a, the inclinations I and the eccentricities e of the satellites involved. Thus, the uncertainties with which such Keplerian orbital elements are known unavoidably have repercussions onto the coefficients themselves. For uncertainties in the semimajor axes of 1 - 2 cm and of about 0.5 - 0.01 / 0.03 milliarcseconds in the inclinations we have shown that the resulting systematic bias due to the imperfect removal of the J2 signal may be as large as 14 - 29% of the Lense-Thirring signatures.
