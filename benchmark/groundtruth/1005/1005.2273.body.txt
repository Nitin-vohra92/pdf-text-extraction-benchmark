Pseudorandom sequence generators have multiple applications in radar systems, simulation, error-correcting codes, spread-spectrum communication systems and cryptography. One of the most interesting pseudorandom sequence generators is the nonlinear filter of m-sequences, as it produces sequences with optimal properties.

A nonlinear filter F is a kth order nonlinear function applied to the L stages of an LFSR with a primitive feedback polynomial. Let {an} be the LFSR output sequence; then the generic element an is an  =  αn  +  α2n  +  ...  +  α2(L - 1)n, α∈GF(2L) being a root of the LFSR characteristic polynomial. Thus, the filtered sequence {zn} can be represented as

[formula]

[formula]

with ri being the cardinal of coset Ei [\cite=RUEPPEL], N the number of cosets Ei with binary weight ≤  k and Ci∈GF(2L) constant coefficients. Note that the ith term in the expression of {zn} corresponds to the characteristic sequence {SEin} of coset Ei. Therefore {zn} can be written as the termwise sum of the characteristic sequences associated with every coset Ei. From the above the following can be noted:

Taking the above considerations into account, we can compute the probability of choosing a nonlinear filter F, whose output sequence {zn} has optimal properties. In fact, let nfk be the number of kth order nonlinear filter functions and nfm the number of the previous functions whose output sequences {zn} have maximun linear complexity [formula], then

[formula]

[formula]

If L is prime (which is the most common case), then all the cardinals ri equal L. Consequently, nfm and Pr  can be rewritten as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is a well known fact that if bn  →    ∞  , then (1 - b- 1n)bn  →  e- 1. As Nk  ≤  2L - 1, if k≃L / 2 then Nk≃2L - 1. Thus,

[formula]

For L  =  257 (a typical value for the LFSR in communication systems), Pr   >  0.998

In addition, this kind of nonlinear filter also has maximum period. Indeed, as those filters contain the characteristic sequences {SEin} associated with all the cosets Ei, they also contain that of coset E1 the period [\cite=PARK] of which is 2L  -  1.

Conclusions: Nonlinear filters of m-sequences are believed to be excellent pseudorandom sequence generators. This is not only because they are very easy to implement with high-speed electronic devices, but also because they are highly likely to produce sequences with optimal properties.
