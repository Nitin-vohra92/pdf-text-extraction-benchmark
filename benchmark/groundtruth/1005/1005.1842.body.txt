L∞ to Lp constants for Riesz projections

Introduction

This work originated in an attempt to answer the following question: Do there exist pairs of exponents q and p with q > p > 2 for which the Riesz projection on the infinite torus is bounded from Lq to Lp? This question remains open, as far as we know. The present note presents a few results of some intrinsic interest in the finite dimensional setting, giving relevant background for the original problem for the infinite torus.

Using standard multi-index notation, we write the Fourier series of a function f in [formula] on the n-torus [formula] as

[formula]

The operator

[formula]

is the Riesz projection on [formula], and, as an operator on [formula], it has norm 1. If we instead view P+n as an operator on [formula] for 1 < p <   ∞  , then a theorem of B. Hollenbeck and I. Verbitsky [\cite=HV00] says that its norm is [formula].

We compute the norm [formula] of a function f in [formula] with respect to Lebesgue measure σn on [formula], normalized such that [formula]. Using this normalization, we let [formula] denote the norm of the operator [formula] for q  ≥  p  ≥  2. We will restrict ourselves to computations and estimates of the norms [formula]. By Hölder's inequality, [formula] is a continuous and nondecreasing function, and, by the theorem of Hollenbeck and Verbitsky, we have [formula]. Of particular interest is the number

[formula]

called the critical exponent of P+n according to the terminology of [\cite=FIP84]. The critical exponent pn is well-defined since clearly [formula]. By continuity, we have [formula].

We will present three theorems. The first says that the critical exponent of P+1 equals 4. In view of this result, one is led to ask if the precise value of [formula] can be computed also when p > 4 and whether we can compute or estimate the critical exponent pn for n > 1. These problems are only given partial solutions: Our second theorem gives the right asymptotics for [formula] when p  →    ∞  , and our third theorem says that 2 + 2 / (2n - 1)  ≤  pn  <  4 when n > 1.

The next three sections present these results. Section 5 contains a brief discussion of the problem for the infinite torus, while the final section discusses extensions to the setting of compact abelian groups.

The critical exponent of P+1

The critical exponent of P+1 is 4.

We write P-1 = I - P+1 and note that [formula] whenever f is a bounded function on [formula]. Thus

[formula]

This estimate implies that p1  ≥  4. To see that we also have p1  ≤  4, we consider the function f(ζ) = (1 - εζ)2 / |1 - εζ|2. We assume that 0 < ε < 1 / 2 and find that P+1f(ζ) = 1 - ε2  -  εζ. We estimate the Lp norm of P+1f from the power series expansion of (1 - εζ / (1 - ε2))p / 2. This leads to the estimate

[formula]

when ε  →  0. It follows that we may achieve [formula] for every p > 4 by choosing ε sufficiently small.

We note that in general we have [formula] only when n = 1, so that the preceding proof does not work when n > 1.

Asymptotic behavior of [formula] when p  →    ∞

We have [formula]

This theorem is a corollary of a corresponding result for the Hilbert transform (the conjugation operator), which we define as

[formula]

By a well-known theorem of Pichorides [\cite=Pic72], we have

[formula]

The Hilbert transform maps real functions to real functions, and we write [formula] when the domain is a real Lp space.

The following result of Zygmund [\cite=Zyg68] will give an upper bound for [formula]

(Zygmund) For real valued f such that |f|  ≤  1 and 0  ≤  α  <  π / 2, we have

[formula]

From Zygmund's theorem and Chebychev's inequality, we get that for real valued f with |f|  ≤  1 we have

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Now Stirling's formula implies that

[formula]

To prove the reverse inequality, we consider the function

[formula]

We have H( arg (1 - eiθ)) =  -  log |1 - eiθ| and

[formula]

Since

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

and we conclude that [formula].

We turn next to the complex case. What follows is a small variation of a construction used to prove vector-valued inequalities [\cite=Gra04]. We begin by noting that for arbitrary real numbers λ1 and λ2 and 0 < p <   ∞  , we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

if f = f1 + if2 is complex valued function with f1 and f2 are real valued, then

[formula]

Since x1f1 + x2f2  =  Re

[formula]

Hf ≤ A ( H ) f |x| edx

[formula]

H ≤ A ( |x| edx ) H = Aπ Γ(p/2+1) H .

[formula]

lim H ≤ lim H =.

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

and we therefore obtain Theorem 2 as an immediate consequence of Theorem 2'.

We note that since [formula], Hollenbeck and Verbitsky's theorem gives

[formula]

On the other hand, using the function [formula] with f as in the proof of Theorem 2', we obtain

[formula]

A. Chang and R. Fefferman's counterpart to the John-Nirenberg theorem (see [\cite=CF80]) could be used in place of Zygmund's lemma. However, we are not aware of any version of the John-Nirenberg theorem for [formula] that is sufficiently precise to improve our asymptotic estimates for n > 1.

Critical exponents for n > 1

We have [formula] when n > 1.

Here the right inequality is of interest because it shows that p1 > p2, and this means that the problem is truly multi-dimensional in contrast to the one for the Lp to Lp constants. The left inequality is probably far from optimal; the main point of this estimate is the fact that we have pn > 2 for every n. It appears to be a difficult problem to decide whether lim n  →    ∞pn > 2.

We prove the left inequality by induction on n. By Theorem 1, this inequality is in fact an equality when n = 1.

Suppose now that we have [formula] for q = 2 + 2 / (2n - 1 - 1). Consider P+n as the composition of the projections P+n - 1 acting on the first n - 1 variables and P+1 acting on the n-th variable. If we write ζ = (ξ,ζn) with ξ = (ζ1,...,ζn - 1), we may write this as

[formula]

We now observe that since [formula], the Riesz-Thorin theorem implies that we also have [formula] when

[formula]

Setting

[formula]

we therefore obtain

[formula]

We clearly have pn + 1  ≤  pn, so the only remaining task is to show that p2 < 4. Let g be a homogeneous holomorphic polynomial on the bidisk with [formula] We set [formula] and find that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and since the functions 1,g,g2 are mutually orthogonal, we may compute [formula] explicitly:

[formula]

Thus [formula] whenever [formula] One can take, for example, the polynomial

[formula]

Note that we may obtain a slightly better upper bound by computing the Lp norm of P+2h from the expansion of (P+2h)p / 2 into a power series in g. By this approach, using the polynomial

[formula]

we have found that in fact p2  ≤  3.67632.

The critical exponent for n =   ∞

Let σ∞ denote Haar measure on [formula] normalized so that [formula], and let [formula] be the corresponding Lp spaces. A multi-index α is now a sequence

[formula]

where only finitely many of the integers αj are nonzero. We write α  ≥  β if we have αj  ≥  βj for every j.

The Riesz projection of a function f in [formula] with Fourier series

[formula]

can now be written as

[formula]

We define the critical exponent of P+∞ as

[formula]

Note the following difference from the finite-dimensional case: we have either [formula] or [formula], so that [formula] for p > p∞.

We want to show that p∞  =   lim n  →    ∞pn. It is clear that the limit exists and that p∞  ≤   lim n  →    ∞pn. To show that we have equality, we assume that 2  ≤  p∞  <   lim n  →    ∞pn. Let φ be a function of norm 1 in [formula] such that [formula] for p∞  <  p  <   lim n  →    ∞pn. Let n be a positive integer and set

[formula]

Then [formula]. We observe also that

[formula]

It is plain that [formula]. On the other hand, since P+nφn  →  P+∞φ in L2, there is a subsequence P+nkφnk converging to P+φ almost everywhere. Thus, by Fatou's lemma, [formula]. Hence [formula], which means that [formula] for sufficiently large n. This contradicts the assumption that p < pn.

We conclude that if we could prove that lim n  →    ∞pn > 2, then we would have a positive answer to the question asked in the first paragraph of this note.

Extensions and comments

The preceding results about critical exponents extend to the following more general setting. Let G be a compact abelian group and let E be a subset of the dual group Ĝ. We then define the E-projection of a function f in L2(G) as

[formula]

When E generates an order in the dual group Ĝ (as it may for connected groups G), the proof of Theorem [\ref=theo1] still works, so that PE has critical exponent 4. Observe also that a direct analogue of Theorem [\ref=riez-thorin] can be obtained in this case.

In an attempt to simplify matters, we have studied the following example which appears to be the simplest nontrivial case, at least from a computational point of view. Take [formula], and consider Riesz projection to be the operator obtained by restricting to the set [formula] in the Fourier domain. The set {0,1} does not generate an order, so we can not apply the observations made above. However, we may compute the critical exponent using the fact that the problem of maximizing the p-norm of the projection has the following geometrical interpretation. Indeed, we want to compute the maximum of mp0 + mp1 + mp2 where m0,m1,m2 are the lengths of the medians of a triangle with vertices in the closed unit disc. It may be seen that the critical exponent equals the solution of the equation 2p + 2 = 3(3 / 2)p, which means that p1  =  3.08164.... It is a curious fact that this number is also the critical exponent of a different projection in [\cite=FIP84].

The corresponding multi-variable problem seems to be not much easier than the one for [formula]. Even for [formula] we have not been able to compute the critical exponent numerically. All we can say is that the critical exponent for P{0,1}2 is strictly smaller than p1 and in fact p2  ≤  2.93039.... This is far from the corresponding lower bound 2.28107... obtained from the Riesz-Thorin theorem, cf. the proof of Theorem [\ref=riez-thorin].
