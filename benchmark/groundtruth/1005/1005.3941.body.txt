Modified Hamiltonian formalism for higher-derivative theories

Introduction

It is a long-standing problem whether and why it is sufficient to use in physics the Lagrangians containing only first order time derivative. This is the more intriguing that adding higher derivatives may improve our models in some respects, like ultraviolet behaviour [\cite=1b] [\cite=2b] (in particular, making modified gravity renormalizable [\cite=3b] or even asymptotically free [\cite=4b]); also, higher-derivative Lagrangians appear to be a useful tool to describe some interesting models like relativistic particles with rigidity, curvature and torsion [\cite=19b] Moreover, almost any effective theory obtained by integrating out some degrees of freedom (usually, but not always, those related to high energy excitations) of the underlying "microscopical" theory contains higher derivatives. One can argue that the effective theory, being an approximation to perfectly consistent quantum theory need not to be considered and quantized separately. However, we are never sure if our theory is the basic or effective one; therefore, it is important to know whether it is at all possible to quantize the effective theory in a way which would correctly reproduce some aspects of the microscopic one.

First step toward the quantum theory is to put its classical counterpart in Hamiltonian form. Standard framework for dealing with higher-derivative theories on Hamiltonian level is provided by Ostrogradski formalism [\cite=5b]-[\cite=9b]. The main disadvantage of the latter is that the Hamiltonian, being linear function of some momenta, is necessarily unbounded from below. In general, this cannot be cured by trying to devise an alternative canonical formalism. In fact, any Hamiltonian is an integral of motion while it is by far not obvious that a generic system described by higher-derivative Lagrangians posses globally defined integrals of motion, except the one related to time translation invariance. Moreover, the instability of Ostrogradski Hamiltonian is not related to finite domains in phase space which implies that it survives standard quantization procedure (i.e. cannot be cured by uncertainty principle).

Ostrogradski approach has also some other disadvantages. There is no straightforward transition from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formalism. In fact, Ostrogradski approach is based on the idea that the consecutive time derivatives of initial coordinate(s) form new coordinates qi  ~  q(i - 1). It appears then that the Lagrangian cannot be viewed as a function on the tangent bundle to coordinate manifold because it leads to incorrect equations of motion. Also, the Legendre transformation to the cotangent bundle (phase space) cannot be performed. One deals with this problem by adding Lagrange multipliers enforcing the proper relation between new coordinates and time derivatives of the original ones. This results in further enlarging of coordinate manifold; moreover, the theory becomes constrained (in spite of the fact that the initial theory may be nonsingular in the Ostrogradski sense, c.f. eq. ([\ref=e:0]) below) and the Hamiltonian formalism is obtained by applying Dirac constraint theory, i.e., by reduction of the cotangent bundle to submanifold endowed with sympletic structure defined by Dirac brackets.

In the present paper an alternative approach is proposed. It leads directly to the Lagrangians which, being a function on the tangent manifold, gives correct equations of motion; no new coordinate variables need to be added. Furthermore, for Lagrangians nonsingular in Ostrogradski sense the Legendre transformation takes the standard form. Our approach is also applicable to the most interesting case of singular Lagrangians (for example, those defining f(R) gravities [\cite=10b]).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:2] we consider nonsingular Lagrangians containing second and third order time derivatives. Constrained theories are discussed in Section [\ref=sec:3]. The general formalism is applied to mini-superspace formulation of f(R) gravity [\cite=11b] in Section [\ref=sec:4]. In Section [\ref=sec:5], the modifications necessary to cover the field-theoretic case are given. In Appendix we describe (for one degree of freedom) the generalization of our formalism to Lagrangians containing arbitrary high derivatives.

Nonsingular Lagrangians of second and third order

In this section we consider the Lagrangians containing second and third time derivatives which are nonsingular in Ostrogradski sense. Ostrogradski approach is based on the idea that the consecutive time derivatives of the initial coordinate form a new coordinates, qi  ~  q(i - 1). However, it has been suggested [\cite=12b]-[\cite=15b], [\cite=18b] that one can use every second derivative as a new variable, qi  ~  q(2i - 2). We generalize this idea by introducing new coordinates as some functions of the initial ones and their time derivatives. Our paper is inspired by the results obtainded in Ref. [\cite=13b].

The case of second derivatives

Let us start with Lagrangians containing time derivatives up to the second order,

[formula]

here q = (qμ), [formula] denotes the set of generalized coordinates. The nonsingularity condition of Ostrogradski reads

[formula]

In order to put our theory in the first-order form we define new coordinates qμ1,qν2:

[formula]

where χμ are the functions specified below.

We select an arbitrary function

[formula]

subjected to the single condition

[formula]

Now, χμ are defined as a unique (at least locally due to ([\ref=e:0])) solution to the following set of equations

[formula]

The new Lagrangian, which is now a standard Lagrangian of first order, is given by

[formula]

It differs from the initial one by an expression which becomes "on-shell" a total time derivative.

The equation of motion for qμ2 yield

[formula]

which, by virtue of ([\ref=l36]), implies

[formula]

For the remaining variables qμ1 one obtains

[formula]

and taking into account ([\ref=l37]) one gets the initial Euler-Lagrange equations.

It is worth to notice that, contrary to the original Ostrogradski approach, the formalism presented above leads directly to the standard picture of Lagrangian as a function defined on the tangent bundle to coordinate space (with no need of enlarging of the latter by adding the appropriate Lagrange multipliers).

Our Lagrangian ([\ref=l40b]) is nonsingular in the usual sense so one can directly pass to the Hamiltonian picture by performing Legendre transformation leading to canonical dynamics on cotangent bundle.

To this end we define the canonical momenta

[formula]

[formula]

By virtue of ([\ref=l36]) the second set of equations can be uniquely solved (at least locally) for [formula]

[formula]

As for the first set ([\ref=l39]), we note that [formula] appears (linearly) only in the fourth term on the RHS. Again, the same condition ([\ref=l36]) allows us to solve ([\ref=l39]) for [formula],

[formula]

The Hamiltonian H is computed in standard way and the final result reads

[formula]

where everything is expressed in terms of q1,q2,p1 and p2. We have checked, by direct calculation, that the canonical equations following from H are equivalent to the initial Lagrangians ones.

There exists canonical transformation which relates our Hamiltonian to the Ostrogradski one. It reads

[formula]

where tilde refers to Ostrogradski variables and fμ(q1,q2,p2) solve eqs. ([\ref=l38]), i.e. [formula]. The corresponding generating function Φ has the form

[formula]

However, it should be stressed that Ostrogradski Hamiltonian is singular in the sense that the inverse Legendre transformation cannot be performed (contrary to our case). This means that the structure of sympletic manifold (phase space) as a cotangent bundle to coordinate manifold is not transparent if Ostrogradski variables are used.

Let us conclude this part with a very simple example. The Lagrangian

[formula]

is nonsingular in Ostrogradski sense provided β  ≠  0. We take

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, the Hamiltonian reads

[formula]

It depends on an arbitrary parameter α. One can pose the question whether any relevant physical quantity may depend on α. The answer is no: all physical quantities are α-independent. Formally this can be shown using eqs [\eqref=eq116] and [\eqref=eq117]. Indeed, the function generating the canonical transformation to Ostrogradski variables reads

[formula]

The corresponding canonical transformation takes the form

[formula]

when inserted into the Hamiltonian [\eqref=l48b] it yields the standard Ostrogradski Hamiltonian

[formula]

It does not depend on α. Therefore, the energy (energy spectrum in quantum theory) does not depend on α.The role of our α-dependent modification is to provide the formalism which yields standard Lagrangian dynamics and regular Legendre transformation.

The above explanation is slightly formal. We shall now look at the problem of α dependence from a slightly different point of view. Let us note that the classical state our system is uniquely determined once the values of q(t), [formula], [formula], [formula] at some moment t are given. Moreover, most physically relevant quantities are constructed via Noether procedure (they are either conserved or partially conserved, i.e., their time derivatives are defined by transformation properties of symmetry breaking terms in the action). As such they are expressible in terms of q, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Therefore the latter are the basic variables. One can find their quantum counterparts provided we compute the relevant Poisson brackets.

To this end we write out the canonical equations of motion following from eq. [\eqref=l48b]:

[formula]

They lead to the following relations

[formula]

One can now find the Poisson brackets among q, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The nonvanishing ones read

[formula]

Note that they are α-independent. Upon quantizing we get four observables obeying α-independent algebra. Any other observable including energy can be constructed out of them so its spectrum and other properties do not depend on α.

The case of third derivatives

Let us consider a nonsingular Lagrangian of the form

[formula]

It is slightly surprising that this case (and, in general, the case when the highest time derivatives are of odd order - see Appendix) is simpler. We define the new variables

[formula]

Next, the function [formula] is selected which obeys

[formula]

here qμ3 are additional variables. The modified Lagrangian reads

[formula]

It can be easily shown that the Euler-Lagrange equations for L yield the initial equations for the original variable [formula]. Again, as in the second-order case, the Legendre transformation can be directly performed due to the condition ([\ref=l49]). The momenta read

[formula]

By virtue of ([\ref=l49]) one can solve ([\ref=l51]) for [formula],

[formula]

Inserting this solution into eq. ([\ref=l52]) one computes

[formula]

the solution is (at least locally) unique because L is, by assumption, nonsingular in Ostrogradski sense. Similarly, ([\ref=l53]) can be solved in terms of [formula]:

[formula]

Finally, Hamiltonian is of the form

[formula]

where everything is expressed in terms of q's and p's (the terms containing [formula] cancel). As above, we have checked that the canonical equations of motion yield the initial equation. The canonical transformation which relates our formalism to the Ostrogradski one reads

[formula]

where fμ is the solution of eq. ([\ref=l51]), i.e., [formula]. The relevant generating function reads

[formula]

Again, the advantage of our Hamiltonian over the Ostrogradski one is that the former is nonsingular in the sense that the inverse Legendre transformation can be performed directly.

The second order Lagrangian once more

By comparing Section [\ref=subsec:1] and [\ref=subsec:2] we see that the modified Hamiltonian formalism is somewhat simpler in the case of third order Lagrangian (actually, as it is shown in Appendix, this is the case for all Lagrangians of odd order). Namely, in latter case no counterpart of the condition ([\ref=l40]) is necessary. This will appear to play the crucial role in the case of singular (in Ostrogradski sense) Lagrangians (see Section [\ref=sec:3] below). Therefore, as a preliminary step, we consider here the second order Lagrangians as a special, singular case of third order ones. The resulting Hamiltonian formalism is then constrained. However, with an additional assumption that the function F does not depend on qμ2, one can perform complete reduction of phase space obtaining the structure described in Section [\ref=subsec:1].

Let

[formula]

and [formula] obeys ([\ref=l49]). We define

[formula]

The relevant momenta read

[formula]

There is one set of primary constraints ([\ref=l58]). On the other hand, due to the condition ([\ref=l49]) [formula] and [formula] can be expressed in terms of q1,q2,q3,p1,p3. The Dirac Hamiltonian takes the form

[formula]

where cμ are Lagrange multipliers enforcing the constraints [formula].

The stability of primary constraints implies

[formula]

In order to check the stability of secondary constraints Φ2μ we note that, as it can be verified by direct computation,

[formula]

Using ([\ref=l67b]) together with

[formula]

we arrive at the following condition

[formula]

The initial Lagrangian is nonsingular and eq. ([\ref=l68]) can be used to determine the Lagrange multipliers cν uniquely. Therefore, the are no further constraints.

In order to convert our constraints into strong equations we define Dirac brackets. To this end we compute

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

By assumption, W is a nonsingular matrix. Consequently,

[formula]

is also nonsingular and

[formula]

Dirac bracket takes the following form

[formula]

The constraints Φ1μ depend on p2μ only. We conclude from ([\ref=l64b]) that the Dirac brackets for qμ1,qμ3,p1μ,p3μ take the canonical form. Moreover, p2μ = 0 while qμ2 can be determined from ([\ref=l67]). Note that the solution for qμ2, by virtue of eq. ([\ref=l40]) reads

[formula]

So, up to renumbering q2  ↔  q3 we arrived at the same scheme as in Section [\ref=subsec:1].

In order to illustrate the above approach, we use the same example as before:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then H takes the form

[formula]

while the constraints are

[formula]

and serve to eliminate p2μ and qμ2,

[formula]

Inserting this back into the Hamiltonian we arrive at the following expression

[formula]

which coincides with the one given by eq. ([\ref=l48b]) provided the replacement q2  ↔  q3, p2  ↔  p3 has been made.

Singular Lagrangians of the second order

In this section we consider the second order Lagrangians

[formula]

which are singular in the Ostrogradski sense, i.e.

[formula]

For standard Ostrogradski approach to such singular Lagrangians see, for example, Ref. [\cite=16b] [\cite=17b].

The formalism of Section [\ref=subsec:1] is not directly applicable because due to eq. ([\ref=l68b]), eqs. ([\ref=l40]) cannot be solved to determine the functions χμ. Moreover, eqs. ([\ref=l40]) put in this case further restrictions on the form of F.

In order to get rid of these problems we will follow the method of Section [\ref=subsec:2] and consider L as a third order singular Lagrangian. From this point of view its singularity comes both from eq. ([\ref=l68b]) and the fact that the third order time derivatives are absent. Given a singular Lagrangian L we select a function [formula] obeying ([\ref=l49]) and define

[formula]

As before, the canonical momenta given by ([\ref=l58]) provide the primary constraints while ([\ref=l59]) and ([\ref=l57]) allow us to compute [formula] and [formula]. The Hamiltonian is given by eq. ([\ref=l60]). The secondary constraints read again

[formula]

Now we have to investigate the stability of Φ2μ. To this end we assume that W has rank K, K < N; this implies the existence of J = N - K linearly independent null eigenvectors [formula], [formula],

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=l68]) do not determine uniquely the Lagrange multipliers cμ; on the contrary, we get new constraints of the form

[formula]

here, as previously, [formula], so the above constraints contain q1,q2,q3,p1 and p3.

We have started with third order formalism; therefore, our phase space is 6N-dimensional. As in nonsingular case (Section [\ref=sec:2]) we would like to eliminate q2's and p2's. The latter are equal zero by primary constraints Φ1μ. As far as q2's are considered the situation is more involved.

First, by virtue of the assumption ([\ref=l68b]) about W we can determine from eqs. ([\ref=l70]) K variables qμ2 in terms of q1,p1,q3,p3 and the remaining q2's. By substituting the resulting expression back to eqs. ([\ref=l70]) we arrive at J constraints on q1,p1,q3 and p3. We denote these new constraints by ψa(q1,q3,p1,p3). Let us now concentrate on the constraints ([\ref=l71]). In general, they contain the qμ2 variables and imply the constraints on q1,q3,p1,p3 only provided q2's enter in the combinations which can be determined from eqs. ([\ref=l70]). In order to decide if it happens consider the variations δqμ2 which do not change the RHS of ([\ref=l70]). From the definition of Wμν we conclude that such δqμ2 are linear combinations of γμa (see ([\ref=l70b])). If the RHS of ([\ref=l71]) are stationary under such variations δqμ2, eqs. ([\ref=l70]) and ([\ref=l71]) can be combined to yield the constraints which do not depend on q2's. The relevant condition reads

[formula]

where a takes M values, which without loss of generality can be chosen as [formula]. In this way we obtain M new constraints on q1,p1,q3,p3.

One can check that

[formula]

By virtue of ([\ref=l72]) we find

[formula]

Let us summarize. For the nonsingular second order Lagrangian viewed as a singular third order one, (q1,p1,q3,p3) forms the reduced phase space; no further constraints exist. On the contrary, in the singular case q1,p1,q3,p3 are still constrained. First, there exist J constraints ψa(q1,p1,q3,p3); moreover, if some (say - M) ψ's are in involution (on the constraint surface) with all ψ's there exist additional M constraints following from eqs. ([\ref=l70]) and ([\ref=l71]). This agrees with the conclusions of Ref. [\cite=16b].

In general, for singular Lagrangian it is not possible to determine uniquely all Lagrange multipliers cμ. However, we are in fact interested only in dynamical equations for q1,q3,p1 and p3. Therefore, we can use the following Hamiltonian

[formula]

On the constraint surface it does not depend on q2's,

[formula]

The existence of further secondary constraints depend on the particular form of the Lagrangian.

Finally, let us note that the canonical transformation ([\ref=l54b]) leads to the form of dynamics presented in Ref. [\cite=16b]. However, within our procedure the Legendre transformation from the tangent bundle of configuration manifold to phase manifold is again straightforward (if one takes into account standard modifications due to the existence of constraints).

Singular higher derivative Lagrangians were also considered in [\cite=18r]. The authors considered the physically important case of reparametrization invariant theories (higher-derivative reparametrization invariant Lagrangians appear, for example, in the description of radiation reaction [\cite=19r]). In their geometrical approach the image of the Legendre transformation form a submanifold of some cotangent bundle. This suggests that in the case of higher-derivative singular theories it is advantageous to start with enlarged phase space; this agrees with our conclusions.

To conclude this section with a simple example consider the following Lagrangian

[formula]

It is singular and the matrix W (eq. ([\ref=l68c])) is of rank 1 for β  ≠  0 and 0 for β = 0. We take F as

[formula]

Assume first β  ≠  0. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

The primary constraints are

[formula]

while the Hamiltonian reads

[formula]

One easily derives the secondary constraints

[formula]

The stability for Φ2μ yields

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=l75c]) allows us to compute c1,

[formula]

while ([\ref=l75d]) provides a new constraint. Its stability enforces c1 = 0 which together with ([\ref=l75e]) yields further constraint

[formula]

Finally, differentiating the above equation with respect to time we get c2 = 0. The resulting Hamiltonian is

[formula]

Still we have to take into account the constraints Φ2μ,Φ3 and Φ4. The latter two can be rewritten as

[formula]

Φ2μ and Φ3μ are now used in order to eliminate all variables except qμ1,p1μ and q23,p32. The only nonstandard Dirac bracket reads

[formula]

The Hamiltonian, when expressed in terms of unconstrained variables, takes the form

[formula]

Let us note that the limit β  →  0 is smooth. Of course, we could put β = 0 from the very beginning and arrive at the same conclusion.

An example: mini-superspace formulation of f(R) gravity

As a more elaborate but still a toy example we consider mini-superspace Hamiltonian formulation of f(R) gravity [\cite=11b]. We consider the following (LFRW - type) metrics

[formula]

Under such reduction the Lagrangian of f(R) gravity takes the form

[formula]

where the curvature is given by

[formula]

We see that L depends on second time derivatives. We proceed along the lines described in Section [\ref=sec:2]. The basic dynamical variables are chosen as follows

[formula]

while

[formula]

is determined by eq. ([\ref=l40]) once appropriate F is selected. We take

[formula]

under the assumption f''  ≠  0, eqs. ([\ref=l76]) and ([\ref=l40]) yield

[formula]

Solving ([\ref=l77]) with respect to [formula] we find

[formula]

The modified Lagrangian reads

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that L leads to the correct equations of motion. In order to simplify our considerations we introduce new variable

[formula]

In terms of new variable L reads

[formula]

Now, we compute the canonical momenta:

[formula]

One can solve ([\ref=l78]) and ([\ref=l79]) in terms of [formula] and [formula]. We form the Hamiltonian

[formula]

Now, we investigate the stability of [formula] constraint

[formula]

The stability condition for Φ2 determines μ; an explicit expression for μ is irrelevant for what follows. In fact, (Φ1,Φ2) are second class constraints

[formula]

Thus, the constraints can be solved provided we use Dirac brackets. In particular, the Hamiltonian takes a simple form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Moreover, Dirac brackets for the variables a1,n1,π1,p1 remain canonical. Therefore, eqs. ([\ref=l80]) and ([\ref=l81]) give the complete Hamiltonian description. We have checked explicitly that it leads to correct equations of motion. In the case under consideration our formalism, when compared with Ostrogradski version, seems to be more complicated. However, it has an advantage that the curvature R is one of basic variables.

Field theory

Our formalism has a straightforward generalization to the field theory case. For simplicity, we consider only the Lagrangian densities depending on first and second derivatives. Such a density can be written in the form

[formula]

Again, we put Φ  =  Φ1 and select a function [formula] obeying

[formula]

in the case of multicomponent field the relevant matrix should be nonsingular. We define, as previously, the function

[formula]

as the (locally unique by virtue of ([\ref=fe:1])) solution to the equation

[formula]

Finally, the new Lagrangian density reads

[formula]

It is now straightforward to check that the Lagrange equations

[formula]

yield the initial equation for the original variable [formula]; as in the Section [\ref=subsec:1] [formula]. One can now perform the Legendre transformation. The canonical momenta read

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=fe:2]) can be solve (due to ([\ref=fe:1])) with respect to [formula]:

[formula]

H is defined in a standard way

[formula]

and leads to the correct canonical equations of motions.

Appendix

Extension to the case of arbitrary high derivatives

Here we generalize the approach proposed in Section [\ref=sec:2] to the case of Lagrangians containing time derivatives of arbitrary order [\cite=18b]. We restrict ourselves to the case of one degree of freedom. We start with the Lagrangian depending on time derivatives up to some even order

[formula]

which is assumed to be nonsingular in Ostrogradski sense, [formula]. Define new variables

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Let further F be any function of the following variables

[formula]

obeying

[formula]

and

[formula]

(for n = 1 only ([\ref=w5]) remains).

Finally, we define a new Lagrangian

[formula]

Let us have a look on Lagrange equations

[formula]

Using ([\ref=w3]), ([\ref=w4]), ([\ref=w7]) and ([\ref=w8]) one finds

[formula]

Consider the matrix [formula]  entering the LHS of eq.([\ref=w9]). By virtue of ([\ref=w5]), [formula]  for [formula] while [formula]  due to Ostrogradski nonsingularity condition. Therefore, the first column of our matrix has only one non vanishing element. This, together with the condition ([\ref=w6]) implies that it is invertible. Therefore, eq. ([\ref=w9]) gives

[formula]

Let us now consider ([\ref=w8]) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. We find

[formula]

where, by definition, [formula]. By combining these equations and using ([\ref=w5]) and ([\ref=w10]) we arrive finally at the initial Lagrange equation. We conclude that, contrary to the case of Ostrogradski Lagrangian, our modified Lagrangian leads to proper equation of motion. Let us now consider the Hamiltonian formalism. Again, the Legendre transformation can be immediately performed; neither additional Lagrange multipliers nor constraints analysis are necessary. In fact, let us define the canonical momenta in a standard way

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Due to nonsingularity of [formula]  eqs.([\ref=w14]) can be solved for [formula]

[formula]

Now, eqs.([\ref=w15]) are linear with respect to [formula] and can be easily solved. Finally, the Hamiltonian is calculated according to the standard prescription.

In order to compare the present formalism with the Ostrogradski approach let us note that they must be related by a canonical transformation. To see this we define new (Ostrogradski) variables k,p̃k,  1  ≤  k  ≤  2n:

[formula]

It is easily seen that the above transformation is a canonical one, i.e. the Poisson brackets are invariant. It is not hard to find the relevant generating function

[formula]

Let us now consider the case of Lagrangian depending on time derivatives up to some odd order

[formula]

Again, we define

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Now, we select a function F,

[formula]

subject to the single condition

[formula]

and define the Lagrangian

[formula]

Consider the Lagrange equations ([\ref=w8]). First, we have

[formula]

and, by virtue of ([\ref=w27])

[formula]

The remaining equations read

[formula]

with [formula]. Combining ([\ref=w30]) and ([\ref=w31]) one gets

[formula]

Let us note that no condition of the form ([\ref=w5]) is here necessary.

Also in the odd case the present formalism is related to that of Ostrogradski by a canonical transformation. Indeed, the canonical momenta read

[formula]

by virtue of ([\ref=w27]) one can solve eqs. ([\ref=w33]) for [formula]. The remaining n + 1 equations ([\ref=w55]) are used to compute the velocities [formula]. In fact, using eqs. ([\ref=w25]) - ([\ref=w27]) as well as the Ostrogradski nonsingularity condition [formula] one easily finds

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

Now, one can define the canonical transformation to Ostrogradski variables

[formula]

The relevant generating function reads

[formula]

Summarizing, we have found a modified Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of higher-derivative theories. They are equivalent to the Ostrogradski formalism in the sense that on the Hamiltonian level they are related to the latter by a canonical transformation. However, the advantage of the approach presented is that the Legendre transformation can be performed in a straightforward way.
