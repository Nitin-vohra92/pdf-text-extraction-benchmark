Galois representations with quaternion multiplication associated to noncongruence modular forms

Introduction

To a d-dimensional space Sκ(Γ) of cusp forms of weight κ  >  2 for a noncongruence subgroup Γ under general assumptions, in [\cite=sch85b] Scholl attached a compatible family of 2d-dimensional [formula]-adic representations [formula] of [formula]. Due to the motivic nature of Scholl's construction, one expects these representations to be automorphic in the sense that they are related to automorphic forms as predicted by Langlands. For general Scholl representations, this is too much to hope for at present, owing to the ineffective Hecke operators on noncongruence modular forms and the currently available modularity techniques; but it is achievable if the space admits extra symmetries, as shown in [\cite=lly05] [\cite=all05] [\cite=long061]. In each of these examples, the automorphy was established using the Faltings-Serre modularity technique, which becomes inefficient for general situation. On the other hand, tremendous progress in modularity has been made in recent years. In this paper, we prove the automorphy of degree-4 Scholl representations which admit quaternion multiplication by using modern technology. Moreover, the Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences for forms in the underlying space are also established.

Now we outline our method and main results. The recent settlement of Serre's conjecture over [formula] (cf. Theorem [\ref=serre]) by Khare, Wintenberger and Kisin ([\cite=KW09], [\cite=kisin9]) is useful for establishing the automorphy of 2-dimensional representations of G coming from geometry. In our situation, the Scholl representations [formula] were constructed from geometry, as a variation of Deligne's construction of [formula]-adic Galois representations for congruence cusp forms. They have Hodge-Tate weights 0 and 1 - κ, each of multiplicity d, and all eigenvalues of the characteristic polynomial of a geometric Frobenius element are algebraic integers with the same complex absolute value. When d = 1, by appealing to the now established Serre's conjecture, one concludes that [formula] arises from a congruence newform. When d > 1, all existing potential automorphy criteria, such as [\cite=BLTDR10], assume the regularity condition that the Hodge-Tate weights are distinct, hence they cannot be applied to Scholl representations directly. In this paper we consider the case d = 2 and the representation [formula] has Quaternion Multiplication (QM) over a field K. We prove that when K is quadratic over [formula], after extending the scalar field, [formula] decomposes into the sum of two modular representations (Theorem [\ref=QMoverquadratic]). In the more interesting case that K is biquadratic over [formula], we show that [formula] is a tensor product of two 2-dimensional projective representations [formula] and γ̃ of G, in which γ̃ has finite image. By using Tate's vanishing theorem [formula], we lift γ̃ to an (ordinary) representation γ of G with finite image. Consequently, [formula] can be lifted to a representation η of G such that [formula] is a tensor product of two degree 2 representations of G. Of these γ is induced from a finite character of the absolute Galois group GF of a quadratic field F contained in K, hence is automorphic. Moreover, it is odd if K is not totally real, and even otherwise (Theorem [\ref=thm:exist-chi_u] and Proposition [\ref=oddness]). The other component η is shown to be modular, arising from a weight κ newform of a congruence subgroup (Theorem [\ref=thm:3.2.1]). In fact, for each quadratic F contained in K, [formula] is induced from a degree 2 representation of GF which comes from an automorphic form of [formula] (Theorem [\ref=QMdescent]). Consequently, for K biquadratic over [formula], the automorphy of [formula] can be seen in many ways: in addition to what is described above, it also corresponds to an automorphic representation of [formula], which also implies that it comes from an automorphic representation of [formula] by a result of Ramakrishnan [\cite=Ramakrishnan00].

The automorphy of Scholl representations is useful for understanding arithmetic properties of noncongruence modular forms. An application of the above modularity/automorphy result is an intriguing link between the coefficients of noncongruence cusp forms and congruence automorphic forms via Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences. See .3 for details. Moreover, automorphy and Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences combined can be used to establish the d = 1 case of the unbounded denominator conjecture, a fundamental characterization for the Fourier coefficients of genuine noncongruence modular forms (cf. [\cite=ll10]). Our approach can be extended to handle other kinds of symmetries in a more general context, which will be dealt with in our future work.

This paper is organized in the following manner. In , we obtain a simpler modularity criterion for 2-dimensional representation of G. is devoted to the study of 4-dimensional Galois representations with QM over a biquadratic field. In , we prove the automorphy of Scholl representations of G for the cases d = 1 and d = 2 with QM, as well as the implications to Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences. The main results are recorded in Theorems [\ref=cor:d=1], [\ref=thm:3.2.1], [\ref=QMdescent] and [\ref=ASD]. To illustrate our main results and methods, explicit examples are exhibited in . We recast the known results on automorphy and ASD congruences obtained in [\cite=lly05] [\cite=all05] [\cite=long061] in the framework of QM. A new example of Scholl representations admitting QM over a biquadratic field is also given. The novelty of this example is the role played by the Atkin-Lehner involution. The automorphy of Galois representations and the conjectural ASD congruences are established.

The authors would like to thank Henri Darmon and Siu-Hung Ng for enlightening conversations, Luis Dieulefait for communicating to us modularity results.

Notation

Given a number field F, denote by OF its ring of integers and GF the absolute Galois group [formula]. For any finite prime [formula] of OF dividing the rational prime [formula], write [formula] for the completion of F at [formula] and [formula] its residue field. Its Galois group [formula] is identified with a decomposition group of [formula] in GF. Write [formula] for the inertia subgroup over [formula] and [formula] the arithmetic Frobenius over [formula], which is the usual topological generator of [formula] sending [formula] to [formula]. The geometric Frobenius, which is [formula], is denoted by [formula].

We reserve G for [formula], [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula]. For each [formula] we fix an embedding [formula]. By an [formula]-adic Galois representation over E we mean a continuous representation [formula] where H is a subgroup of G and V a finite-dimensional vector space over E, a finite extension of [formula]. The reference to the [formula]-adic field E will be dropped when it is not important. We refer ρ to V if no confusions arise. Denote by [formula] or [formula] the semi-simplification of ρ. Let ρ be a Galois representation of H as above. If H is compact then there exists an OE-lattice T in V invariant under ρ(H). Let [formula] be the maximal ideal of OE. We get a residual representation [formula] of H on the vector space [formula] over the residue field [formula]. Although [formula] depends on the choice of T, its semi-simplification [formula] does not. Two continuous linear representations ρi, i = 1,2, of the topological group H acting on finite-dimensional Ei-vector spaces Vi, where E1 and E2 are contained in a finite common extension E, are said to be equivalent, denoted ρ1  ~  ρ2, if [formula] as representations of H.

Modularity of degree two [formula]-adic Galois representations

In this section, we derive from known modularity results for 2-dimensional [formula]-adic Galois representations of G a useful modularity criterion for applications in later sections.

Modularity of 2-dimensional [formula]-adic Galois representations

Let κ  ≥  2 and N  ≥  1 be integers and [formula] be the space of cusp forms of weight κ and level N. Suppose that [formula] is a newform normalized with a1 = 1. The following is a classical result proved by Deligne ([\cite=De]) when κ > 1, and Deligne and Serre when κ = 1 ([\cite=De2]).

For a newform f as above, the field of coefficients [formula] is a number field. Moreover, for any prime [formula] of Ef, there exists a continuous representation

[formula]

where Ef,λ is the completion of Ef at λ, such that

ρf,λ is odd and absolutely irreducible;

For any [formula], [formula] is unramified at p and [formula];

If [formula], then [formula] is crystalline with Hodge-Tate weights {0,k - 1}.

In what follows, an [formula]-adic representation ρ of G is said to be modular if there exists a modular form [formula] and a prime [formula] of Ef such that ρf,λ  ~  ρ or its dual [formula].

Recall that for any prime p, Gp  ⊂  G denotes a decomposition group at p and Ip  ⊂  Gp is the inertia subgroup. Let [formula] be a representation over a finite field k of characteristic [formula]. Call [formula] modular if there exists a modular form [formula] and a prime [formula] of Ef such that the residual representation f,λ is equivalent to [formula].

The following has been conjectured by Serre and proved by Khare, Wintenberger and Kisin ([\cite=KW09] [\cite=kisin9]). We refer to [\cite=kisin5] for a nice review of Serre's conjecture.

Any odd and absolutely irreducible representation [formula] is modular.

The precise Serre's conjecture also predicts the (minimal) weight and the level of the modular form f, which are not needed here.

The aim of this subsection is to reprove the following result.

Let [formula] be a finite extension. Suppose that [formula] is an [formula]-adic Galois representation such that

ρ is odd and absolutely irreducible;

ρ is unramified at almost all primes;

[formula] is crystalline with Hodge-Tate weights {0,r} such that [formula] and [formula]

Then ρ is modular.

This theorem was essentially proved in [\cite=DM03], as explained in [\cite=Die08]. We sketch the proof below because some ingredients will be used later. We remark that the above modularity lifting theorem is an easy version (compared to that of [\cite=Kis]), however it is enough for the applications in this paper.

The proof will use the discussion of local representation at [formula] and several modularity lifting theorems. First we discuss the local representation [formula] and its reduction. For i  ≥  1, the map

[formula]

is the fundamental character of level i. Note that [formula], where [formula] is the [formula]-adic cyclotomic character.

Since [formula] is crystalline with Hodge-Tate weights {0,r} and [formula], there are two possibilities:

Type I: [formula] is absolutely reducible. In this case, [formula] and [formula]

Type II: [formula] is absolutely irreducible. In this case, [formula] In particular, [formula] is irreducible because [formula] will "swap" ω2 and [formula]. (see the proof of case (3) for the precise statement).

The reader is referred to § 4.2.1 in [\cite=B&M] for the proof of the above statements. We also need the following result on Galois characters.

Let χ:G  →  O×E be an [formula]-adic Galois character which is unramified outside a finite set S of finite primes excluding [formula]. Then χ is a finite character in the sense that the image of χ is a finite (cyclic) group.

Let p be a prime in S. It suffices to show that if χ is ramified at p then the image χ(Ip) is finite. Let Iwp be the wild inertia subgroup of Ip, Itp: = Ip / Iwp the tame inertia group, and Gw: = χ(Iwp). We claim that the map [formula] is an injection. In fact, Gw is a pro-p-group and [formula] is a pro-[formula]-group. So they can only have trivial intersection. Since Gw injects in k×, Gw is a finite group. Replacing [formula] by a suitable finite extension, we may assume that χ factors though Itp. Let τ be a lift of [formula] and σ∈Itp. We have τσ  =  σpτ. Applying χ to this equation, we see that χ(σ)p - 1  =  1. Thus χ(Itp) is contained in the group of (p - 1)th-units in O×E, hence χ(Ip) is finite.

Using the p-adic Hodge theory on the classification of crystalline characters of [formula], we see that [formula] with [formula] a character unramified at [formula]. Applying the above lemma to [formula], we prove the corollary.

The above corollary may fail if G is replaced by GK with [formula] a finite extension. The problem is that the classification of crystalline characters of [formula] is much more complicated if [formula] is inert in K. Here is a more concrete example: Let K be an imaginary quadratic extension of [formula] and consider an elliptic curve E defined over K with complex multiplication by the ring OK. Choose a prime ideal [formula] of OK generated by a prime [formula] inert in K. Then the Tate module [formula] induces a Galois [formula]-character [formula]. Note that χ has Hodge-Tate weights 0 and 1. So it can not be written as [formula], which only has Hodge-Tate weight r.

Let [formula] denote the residue field of OE, where [formula] is the maximal ideal of OE. Let [formula] be the reduction of ρ. We distinguish three cases:

[formula] is reducible but [formula] is irreducible;

[formula] is reducible;

[formula] is irreducible.

Now we proceed to prove Theorem [\ref=tool] case by case. For case (1), [formula] is reducible, hence it is of type I. So [formula]. Then the main theorem in the introduction of [\cite=SW2] and Theorem [\ref=serre] imply that ρ is modular.

Next we consider case (2). Note that [formula] is reducible, so is [formula]. As discussed above, [formula] is of type I and the semi-simplification [formula]. Hence [formula] with [formula]. Twisting ρ by a finite character if necessary, we may assume that [formula] with [formula]. So the Theorem in the introduction of [\cite=SW2] proves that ρ is modular.

Finally, case (3) follows from Theorem 0.3 in the introduction of [\cite=dml] and Theorem [\ref=serre]. Note that the condition [formula] and [formula] implies that [formula] restricted to [formula] is absolutely irreducible, which is required by Theorem 0.3 in the introduction of [\cite=dml].

Galois representations endowed with quaternion multiplication

In this section we show that if a 4-dimensional [formula]-adic representation of G is endowed with quaternion multiplication over a quadratic or biquadratic field, then either it decomposes into the sum of two degree 2 representations, or it is induced from a degree 2 representation of an index 2 subgroup GK of G. In the latter case, we show that this degree 2 representation of GK, after twisting by a character, can be extended to a representation of G.

Quaternion multiplication

If there is a quaternionic action on the space of a 4-dimensional [formula]-adic representation in the following sense, then a lot more can be said. In this section, F is always assumed to be a finite extension of [formula].

Let [formula] be an [formula]-adic representation of G acting on a 4-dimensional F-vector space [formula]. It is said to have quaternion multiplication (QM) if there are linear operators Js and Jt on [formula], parametrized by two distinct non-square integers s and t, satisfying

J2s  =  J2t  =   - id,JsJt  =   - JtJs;

For u∈{s,t} and g∈G, we have [formula] with +   sign if and only if [formula].

In this case, we say that the representation has QM over [formula].

Let [formula] be a 4-dimensional [formula]-adic representation over F with QM over [formula]. Then the following two statements hold.

For a nonsquare u∈{s,t,st}, there are two 2-dimensional [formula]-adic representations σu and σ-u of [formula] over [formula] such that

[formula]

where δu is the character of [formula] with kernel [formula] and [formula]. Consequently, If [formula] is a biquadratic extension of [formula], [formula] is induced from three representations σu of [formula] for u∈{s,t,st}. Further σu is irreducible if [formula] is.

If [formula] is a quadratic extension of [formula], then there is a 2-dimensional [formula]-adic representation σ of G over [formula] such that

[formula]

where θ is the quadratic character of G with kernel [formula]. In particular, [formula] is absolutely reducible.

There is a vast literature on abelian varieties attached to weight 2 congruence Hecke eigenform or more general modular motives possessing quaternion multiplication (QM) due to the existence of extra twists given by operators like Atkin-Lehner involutions (see [\cite=ribet80-twist], [\cite=momose81], [\cite=brown-ghate03], [\cite=ghate-G-J-Quer], [\cite=Dieulefait03] etc). Compared to these cases our situation distinguishes itself by the specific condition on the field of definition for each J operator.

We follow the proof of Theorem 6 in [\cite=all05]. Set Jst  =  JsJt. It is easy to check that Jst satisfies property (b) in Definition [\ref=QM] and J2st  =   - id. Let [formula] and write [formula] for [formula] for simplicity. Given a nonsquare u∈{s,t,st}, we first show that there exists an [formula]-adic 2-dimensional representation σu of [formula] such that [formula]. Since J2u  =   - id, its eigenvalues are contained in E. Let [formula] be an eigenvector of Ju with eigenvalue i, a square root of - 1. Then property (b) implies that for [formula], [formula] is an eigenvector of Ju with the opposite eigenvalue - i. Thus Ju has eigenvalues ±  i with 2-dimensional ±  i-eigenspace. Since Ju commutes with the action of [formula], each ±  i-eigenspace affords a [formula]-action, denoted by σu, σ-u, respectively. When u is a nonsquare, by property (b), any [formula] gives rise to an E-isomorphism from the ( - i)-eigenspace to the i-eigenspace. On the ( - i)-eigenspace, for all [formula], we have [formula], which shows that σ-u and στu are isomorphic [formula]-modules. Therefore [formula]. Since [formula] is induced from σu, if [formula] is irreducible, so is σu.

Let {v1,v2} be a basis of the i-eigenspace of Ju and choose a nonsquare v∈{s,t,st} not equal to u. Then v3: = Jvv1 and v4: = Jvv2 form a basis of the - i-eigenspace of Ju. With respect to the ordered basis {v1,v2,v3,v4} we may express the operators by the matrices

[formula]

This gives a representation γ of the quaternion group generated by Js and Jt.

First we prove (1). Let [formula]. It follows from (b) that with respect to the same basis, [formula] is represented by [formula] for g∈N, [formula] for [formula], [formula] for [formula], and [formula] for [formula]. This shows that the map sending [formula] to the matrix P(g) is the 2-dimensional representation σu of [formula] and the representation σ-u is given by [formula], where δu is the character of [formula] with kernel [formula]. Next we prove (2). Since [formula], we have [formula]. In this case [formula] is represented by [formula] for g∈N and [formula] for [formula]. Furthermore, {v1 + v3,v2 + v4} is a basis of the i-eigenspace W of JsJt, and {v1 - v3,v2 - v4} is a basis of the ( - i)-eigenspace W- of JsJt. Each space is G-invariant by property (b) since [formula]; denote the 2-dimensional representations on W and W- by σ and σ-, respectively. It is straightforward to check that with respect to the above bases of W and W-, we have σ(g)  =  P(g)  =  σ-(g) for g∈N and σ(g)  =  P(g)  =    -  σ-(g) for [formula]. This shows that [formula], where θ is the quadratic character of G with kernel [formula].

If [formula] is a quadratic extension of [formula], the characteristic polynomial Hp(x) of [formula] is the product of the characteristic polynomials of [formula] and [formula]. We shall see that there is also a natural factorization for Hp(x) when [formula] is biquadratic.

{

Assume [formula] is biquadratic over [formula]. As stated in the theorem above, for any [formula], we have [formula]. Thus for any prime [formula] splitting into two places [formula] in [formula], τ permutes the two places [formula]; and if [formula] is unramified at p, the characteristic polynomial of [formula] is equal to that of [formula]. Therefore [formula] have the same characteristic polynomials if [formula], which occurs if and only if p splits in [formula].

The statement (a) below on the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of [formula] at an unramified place p follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=quaternion] and the remark above.

Let [formula] be a 4-dimensional [formula]-adic representation of G with QM over [formula], a biquadratic extension of [formula]. For u∈{s,t,st}, let σu be as in Theorem [\ref=quaternion].

Let p be a prime different from [formula] at which [formula] is unramified. Then the degree-4 characteristic polynomial Hp(x) of [formula] and the degree-2 characteristic polynomial [formula] of [formula] at a place [formula] of [formula] dividing p are related as follows:

If p splits completely in [formula], then [formula], where [formula] is independent of the choice of [formula] and u;

If p splits in [formula] and not in [formula], then there are two places [formula] of [formula] dividing p, and [formula], where [formula].

If p is inert in [formula], then there is one place [formula] of [formula] dividing p, and [formula].

Suppose u  >  0, [formula] is a complex conjugation, and [formula]. Then Trσu(c)  =  Trστu(c) if [formula] is totally real, and Trσu(c)  =    -  Trστu(c) otherwise.

It remains to prove part (b). This follows from the fact that στu(c)  =  σu(c)δu(c) and δu(c)  =  1 if and only if [formula] is totally real.

Consequently, in case (a2) above, Hp(x) is also the characteristic polynomial of [formula]. Since a prime p splits in at least one of the quadratic fields contained in the biquadratic field [formula], when the representation [formula] admits QM over [formula], we obtain a natural factorization of the characteristic polynomial of [formula] as a product of two quadratic polynomials.

Keep the same notation and assumptions as in Theorem [\ref=quaternion]. Assume that - 1 is not a square in F. Let j denote a square root of - 1 and set E = F(j).

For any [formula], let Hg, +(x) and Hg, -(x) be the characteristic polynomials of σu(g) and σ-u(g) respectively. Then Hg, +(x) and Hg, -(x) are conjugate under the map j  ↦   - j.

Assume [formula] is biquadratic over [formula]. For u, c and τ as in Corollary [\ref=factorization] (b), we have Trσu(c)  =  Trστu(c). Therefore σu is odd if [formula] is not totally real.

Assume [formula] is quadratic over [formula]. Then Trσ(c)  =  Trσ(c)θ(c) for the complex conjugation c∈G.

Consequently, if [formula] at the complex conjugation c, then σ is odd when [formula] is quadratic, and σu is odd for positive u∈{s,t,st} when [formula] is biquadratic.

(a) Let w be a nonzero vector in the representation space [formula] of [formula]. Then w and Juw are linearly independent over F since the eigenvalues of Ju are outside F by assumption. Let w' be a vector in [formula] and not in the F-span 〈w,Juw〉. Claim that w,w',Juw,Juw' are linearly independent over F. If not, then Juw'  =  αw  +  βJuw  +  γw' for some α,β,γ∈F not all zero. Apply Ju to the above relation to get another relation γJuw'  =  βw  -  αJuw  -  w'. Comparing both relations yields γ2  =   - 1, a contradiction. Therefore {w,w',Juw,Juw'} forms an F-basis of [formula]. With respect to this ordered basis, Ju is represented by the block matrix

[formula]

On the extension [formula] the actions of [formula] and Ju are E-linear. Recall that σu and σ-u are [formula] restricted to the ±  j-eigenspaces of Ju on [formula]. It is easy to check that {w - jJuw,w'  -  jJuw'} forms an E-basis for the space of σu and {w + jJuw,w'  +  jJuw'} forms a basis for the space of σ-u. In other words,

[formula]

Since Ju commutes with [formula] by condition (b) of QM, given any [formula], the matrix of [formula] with respect to {w,w',Juw,Juw'} is represented by the block matrix

[formula]

for some 2  ×  2 matrices P and R with entries in F. One checks that

[formula]

This shows that the action of [formula] on the ±  j-eigenspaces of Ju are represented by matrices conjugate under j  ↦   - j, hence the characteristic polynomials Hg,   ± (x) are as asserted.

(b) For u  >  0, a complex conjugation c lies in [formula]. By applying (a) to g  =  c, we get that Trσu(c) and Trστu(c) are conjugate under j  ↦   - j. As c2  =  id, the possible values for Trσu(c) are ±  2 and 0, which all lie in F. Hence Trσu(c)  =  Trστu(c). When [formula] is not totally real, it follows from Corollary [\ref=factorization] (b) that the two traces are opposite, therefore they are equal to zero, and hence σu is odd.

(c) In this case, choose u  =  st, which is a square. The operator Ju  =  Jst: = JsJt commutes with [formula]. The representation σu is called σ and σ-u called [formula] in Theorem [\ref=quaternion]. Apply (a) to g  =  c, the complex conjugation in G. By the same argument as in (b) we conclude Trσ(c)  =  Trσ(c)θ(c).

Finally, using [formula] when [formula] is quadratic, and [formula] for positive u∈{s,t,st} when [formula] is biquadratic, we conclude the oddness of σ and σu respectively.

Quaternion multiplication and extension of representations

Let K be a finite extension of [formula] and V be an [formula]-adic representation of GK. We say that V can be extended to an [formula]-adic representation V' of G if V'|GK  ~  V. Note that V', if exists, is not unique in general.

Assume that [formula] has QM over a biquadratic [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=quaternion], [formula] for u∈{s,t,st}. We shall show that, for each u∈{s,t,st}, there exists a finite character χu of [formula] and a 2-dimensional representation ηu of G such that [formula]. In other words, [formula] can be extended to ηu.

To see this, we return to the proof of Theorem [\ref=quaternion], (1) with a chosen u∈{s,t,st}. The argument there shows that given g,h∈G, there exists a constant [formula] such that [formula]. Hence g  ↦  P(g) defines a degree 2 irreducible projective representation u of G whose restriction to [formula] is the representation σu. Let γ̃u be the map sending gN for [formula] to

[formula]

respectively. Note that γ̃u is a degree 2 irreducible projective representation of G trivial on N and

[formula]

By Tate's vanishing theorem [formula] ([\cite=tate]), there is a representation [formula] with finite image which lifts γ̃u. Then the kernel H of γu is a normal subgroup of N with quotient N / H finite cyclic. Embed the finite image γu(G) into [formula] and regard γu as an [formula]-adic representation.

For any g∈G, there exists [formula] such that γ̃u(g) = su(g)γu(g). It follows from [formula] that ηu: = u  ·  su is also an ordinary representation of G. Since u restricted to [formula] is equal to the representation σu as noted above, su restricted to [formula] is a character, denoted by χu, with kernel containing H. Hence ηu is an extension to G of the representation [formula] of [formula]. Note that γu and [formula] have the same restrictions to [formula], so they differ at most by the quadratic character θu of G with kernel [formula]. Replacing γu by [formula] and ηu by [formula] if necessary, we may assume that [formula] so that [formula]. This proves

Let [formula] be a 4-dimensional [formula]-adic representation of G with QM over a biquadratic [formula]. For u∈{s,t,st}, let σu be as in Theorem [\ref=quaternion]. Then there exists a finite character χu of [formula] such that [formula] extends to a degree 2 representation ηu of G and

[formula]

As irreducible projective representations of [formula], the γ̃u's are in fact equivalent. This can be shown directly (for instance, γ̃u conjugated by [formula] is equivalent to γ̃v) or seen from the fact that the Schur multiplier of [formula] has only one nontrivial element. Hence the ηu's are also projectively equivalent. In particular, they have the same parity, equal to that of ηu with u  >  0.

We close this section by discussing the oddness of the representations occurred.

With the same notation and assumption as in Theorem [\ref=thm:exist-chi_u], we have

(a) for positive u∈{s,t,st}, ηu is odd if and only if σu is odd at both real places of [formula];

(b) the representation [formula] of G corresponds to an automorphic representation of 2 over [formula]. Moreover, it is odd if [formula] is not totally real and even otherwise.

Denote by c the complex conjugation in G.

(a) The relation [formula] implies [formula]. As det (ηu)(g- 1cg) remains the same for all g in G, we see that σu and ηu have the same parity.

(b) The first statement follows from base change [\cite=ac89]. Write γu for [formula] as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:exist-chi_u]. Assume that [formula] is not totally real so that [formula]. By definition, there is a constant [formula] such that [formula] or [formula] or [formula]. In all cases, γu(c) has trace zero, hence is odd. When [formula] is totally real, c fixes [formula] and hence lies in [formula]. Thus [formula], which implies that γu is even.

Galois representations attached to noncongruence cusp forms

Modularity of Scholl representations when d = 1

Let [formula] be a noncongruence subgroup, that is, Γ is a finite index subgroup of [formula] not containing any principal congruence subgroup Γ(N). For any integer κ  ≥  2, the space Sκ(Γ) of weight κ cusp forms for Γ is finite-dimensional; denote by d  =  d(Γ,κ) its dimension. Assume that the compactified modular curve [formula] is defined over [formula] and the cusp at infinity is [formula]-rational. For even κ  ≥  4 and any prime [formula], in [\cite=sch85b] Scholl constructed an [formula]-adic Galois representation [formula] attached to Sκ(Γ). The representations [formula] form a compatible system in the sense that there exists a finite set S of finite primes of [formula] such that for any prime [formula] and primes [formula] and [formula] different from p, the representations [formula] and [formula] are unramified at p and the characteristic polynomials of [formula] under [formula] and [formula] have coefficients in [formula] and agree. Scholl also showed that all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of [formula] have the same complex absolute value p(κ - 1) / 2 (cf. .3 in [\cite=sch85b]). Scholl's results can be extended to odd weights under some extra hypotheses (e.g., [formula], where [formula] is the projection). The readers are referred to the end of [\cite=sch85b] for more details. In this subsection we always assume that [formula] does exist. Our main concern is

Whether [formula] or its dual [formula] is automorphic as predicted by the Langlands conjecture?

If so, then the associated L-function coincides with the L-function of an automorphic representation of some adelic reductive group. When the reductive group is [formula] over [formula], the representation is called "modular" in .

We provide an affirmative answer to the case d = 1.

When d = 1, the Scholl representation [formula] of Γ is modular.

In fact, it has been known for a long time (see [\cite=Sconjecture] (4.8)) that the strong form of Serre's conjecture implies the modularity of 2-dimensional motives over [formula], which can be directly applied to our theorem. Here we use a slightly different method which will be useful later.

Since [formula] forms a compatible system, by Chebotarev Density Theorem, it suffices to show that there exists an [formula] such that [formula] is modular. The plan is to conclude this by applying Theorem [\ref=tool] to [formula] for a large [formula]. Hence we have to show the existence of an [formula] such that [formula] satisfies the three hypotheses in Theorem [\ref=tool]. In [\cite=sch96], Scholl proved that, a general Scholl representation [formula] as above is the [formula]-adic realization of a certain motive over [formula] in the sense of Grothendieck. In particular, there exists a smooth projective [formula]-scheme X such that [formula] as G-representations. Furthermore, he also proved that the Hodge type of [formula] is (κ - 1,0)d and (0,κ - 1)d (Theorem 2.12 in [\cite=sch85b]). Consequently, we know the Hodge-Tate weights of [formula] are 0 and - (κ - 1) and those of [formula] are 0 and κ - 1. Pick [formula] so that X has a smooth model over [formula], the localization of [formula] with respect to the prime [formula]. Then [formula] is crystalline by Faltings' comparison theorem ([\cite=Faltings]). To complete the proof, it remains to show that [formula] is odd and absolutely irreducible.

Write [formula] for [formula], the singular cohomology of X. It follows from the comparison theorem between singular cohomology and étale cohomology that [formula] and the isomorphism is compatible with the action of complex conjugation c. Moreover, the comparison theorem between singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology implies [formula]. By Hodge decomposition, we write [formula] Since the Hodge type of [formula] is (κ - 1,0)d and (0,κ - 1)d, we have [formula] As [formula] for any q,p, we conclude that half of the eigenvalues of c on [formula] are 1 and the other half - 1. When d = 1, this shows that the complex conjugation on the 2-dimensional space [formula] has eigenvalues 1 and - 1, hence [formula] is odd.

Finally we prove that [formula] (hence [formula]) is absolutely irreducible. Suppose otherwise, namely [formula] is absolutely reducible. Denote [formula] by [formula] again and its semi-simplification by [formula]. By assumption, [formula] for some Galois characters χi. Consider [formula] restricted to [formula]. Since [formula] is crystalline with Hodge-Tate weights {0, - (κ - 1)}, reducible and [formula], from the discussion above Lemma [\ref=character], we see that [formula] is of type I. Consequently, we have

[formula]

Hence without loss of generality, we may assume [formula] and [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=character], [formula] and χ2≃ψ2 where ψi are characters of finite order. Pick a prime p large enough such that [formula] is unramified at p. Then the eigenvalues of the characteristic polynomial of [formula] under [formula] do not have the same complex absolute values, a contradiction. Thus [formula] is absolutely irreducible. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Contained in the proof above are the following two useful results.

Let [formula] be a 2d-dimensional [formula]-adic Scholl representation attached to a space Sκ(Γ) of dimension d. Then the eigenvalues of the complex conjugation on the space of [formula] are 1 and - 1, each of multiplicity d.

Let ρ be a 2-dimensional [formula]-adic representation of G such that [formula] is crystalline with Hodge-Tate weights {0, - (κ  -  1)}, where κ  ≥  2. Suppose that [formula] and for almost all primes p the eigenvalues of the characteristic polynomial of [formula] are algebraic numbers with the same complex absolute value. Then ρ is absolutely irreducible.

Automorphy of certain Scholl representations with d  ≥  2

In the remainder of this paper, we consider the automorphy of certain Scholl representations for the case d  ≥  2.

In this subsection, we fix a degree d cyclic extension [formula]. Let [formula] be a 2d-dimensional subrepresentation of the Scholl representation of G attached to a space of weight κ cusp forms for a noncongruence subgroup Γ. We further assume that the Hodge-Tate weights of [formula] are {0, - (κ  -  1)}, each with multiplicity d. For an [formula]-adic Galois representation V of GK and a prime [formula] of OK above [formula], denote by [formula] the set of Hodge-Tate weights of the local Galois representation [formula] and by [formula] the union of [formula] for all primes [formula] above [formula].

(1) Assume that [formula] for some 2-dimensional representation [formula] of GK. Then [formula].

(2) Suppose there is a finite character χ of GK such that [formula] can be extended to a degree 2 representation [formula] of G, then [formula].

We begin by proving a lemma dealing with Hodge-Tate weights:

Let [formula] be a finite Galois extension and V be a finite dimensional Hodge-Tate representation of [formula] over [formula]. Then for any [formula], the Hodge-Tate weights of Vσ are the same as those of V.

Set [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the Hodge-Tate ring. One can find a construction and discussion of [formula] in [\cite=Brian] (see Definition 2.3.6). Both of them are E-vector spaces. It suffices to show that they have the same dimension over E. For any [formula], where vj∈V and [formula], it can be easily checked that [formula]. Hence σ induces a [formula]-linear isomorphism between [formula] and [formula]. Thus [formula] and [formula] have the same E-dimension.

Since Hodge-Tate weights are stable when restricted to a Galois subgroup of finite index, the representations [formula], [formula], and [formula] have the same Hodge-Tate weights. More precisely, suppose that V is an [formula]-adic Galois representation of G and F is a finite extension of [formula]. If [formula] is Hodge-Tate then [formula] for each prime [formula] of OK above [formula]. Now it suffices to show that [formula]. Select σ∈G such that its image in [formula] is a generator. Note that [formula]. We claim that [formula] are the same for all i. If so, since [formula] has Hodge-Tate weights {0, - (κ - 1)} and each weight appears with multiplicity d, we get that [formula]. To prove the claim, it suffices to show that for any prime [formula] of OK we have [formula]. We should be careful that we can not directly use Lemma [\ref=HTconjugate] here because it is not clear that [formula]

Observe that [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] restricted to [formula]. Let ϖ be the maximal ideal of [formula] above [formula] which gives rise to the decomposition group [formula]. Then there exists τ∈G such that [formula]. Note that [formula], so there exists λ∈GK such that λσi(ϖ) = τ(ϖ). Since λ is in GK, it is easy to see that [formula] restricted to [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] restricted to [formula] resulting from the isomorphism [formula] given by conjugation. So without loss of generality, we may assume that σi(ϖ)  =  τ(ϖ). Thus σiτ- 1 is in [formula] but may not be in [formula].

Identify [formula] with [formula] via conjugation by σiτ- 1. The identity map [formula] is an isomorphism of GK-modules. Now we need to show that [formula] and [formula] have the same Hodge-Tate weights on [formula]. This follows from Lemma [\ref=HTconjugate] and the fact that [formula].

We are ready to prove the automorphy of certain Scholl representations. First suppose that the Scholl representation [formula] has degree 4 and admits QM over a quadratic field [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=quaternion], (2), we have, over [formula],

[formula]

for a degree 2 representation σ of G and a quadratic character θ of G with kernel [formula]. So σ and [formula] restricted to the decomposition group [formula] are crystalline, and they have the same Hodge-Tate weights {0, - (1  -  κ)} by Proposition [\ref=odd]. We conclude their absolute irreducibility from Corollary [\ref=irreducible]. Proposition [\ref=cxconj] says that [formula] has trace zero at the complex conjugation, hence by Proposition [\ref=conjugation], both σ and [formula] are odd. It then follows from Theorem [\ref=tool] that σ and [formula] are modular for large [formula], and thus for all [formula] by compatibility. We record this in

Suppose that the Scholl representation [formula] has degree 4 and admits QM over a quadratic field [formula]. Then over [formula] it decomposes as a direct sum of two modular representations σ and [formula]. Here θ is the quadratic character of [formula].

Next we consider a more general situation.

Let K be a degree d cyclic extension of [formula] and [formula] be a 2d-dimensional [formula]-adic subrepresentation of a Scholl representation of G as above. Assume that

[formula] is induced from a 2-dimensional representation [formula] of GK;

There exists a character χ of GK of finite order such that [formula] can be extended to an [formula]-adic representation [formula] of G;

[formula] is crystalline and χ is unramified at any prime above [formula].

Then [formula] is absolutely irreducible. If we further assume that

K is unramified over [formula] and [formula];

[formula] is odd,

then the dual of [formula] is isomorphic to a modular representation ρg,λ of G attached to a weight κ cuspidal newform g, and the following relations on L-series hold:

[formula]

The character χ of GK corresponds to an automorphic form πχ of [formula] by base change [\cite=ac89]. The above expression shows that the semi-simplification of [formula] is automorphic, arising from the form g  ×  πχ of the group [formula]. This is because

[formula]

and as representations of G, [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] (cf. Theorem 38.5 [\cite=curtis-reiner]).

When d = 2, it follows from the work of Ramakrishnan [\cite=Ramakrishnan00] that an automorphic form for [formula] corresponds to an automorphic form for [formula]. In this case the L-function attached to the degree 4 representation [formula] is an automorphic L-function for [formula]. This fact also holds for general d by base change [\cite=ac89]. More precisely, that [formula] comes from an automorphic form of [formula] over [formula] implies that [formula] comes from an automorphic form of [formula] over K, which in turn implies that [formula] corresponds to an automorphic form of [formula] over [formula].

We first show that [formula] is absolutely irreducible. Suppose otherwise. Enlarging the field of coefficients if necessary, we may assume that [formula] for some characters η1 and η2 of G. Note that [formula]. Since [formula] is crystalline at [formula], [formula] is crystalline at any prime above [formula], which in turn implies that [formula] is crystalline at any prime above [formula] because χ is unramified at any prime dividing [formula]. Consequently, each ηi is crystalline at [formula]. Hence [formula] with μi a finite character and κi the Hodge-Tate weight of ηi by Corollary [\ref=character2]. Since [formula] has Hodge-Tate weights 0 and - (κ - 1) by Proposition [\ref=odd], we see that each ηi has Hodge-Tate weight either 0 or - (κ - 1). Therefore [formula]. This contradicts the fact that the roots of the characteristic polynomial of [formula] under the representation [formula] have the same complex absolute value. So [formula] cannot be absolutely reducible.

Now we prove the remaining assertions under the additional assumptions. As shown above, [formula] is absolutely irreducible and has Hodge-Tate weights {0, - (κ - 1)}. Further, since K is unramified above [formula], [formula] is crystalline. Finally, since [formula] is odd by assumption, we conclude from Theorem [\ref=tool] that [formula] comes from a weight κ cuspidal newform g as described in Theorem [\ref=Deligne]. Hence [formula] and the relations on L-functions hold.

Since we have a compatible family of Scholl representations [formula] constructed from geometry, there always exists a prime [formula] large enough such that the conditions (c) and (d) are satisfied. However, the oddness of [formula] is not automatic.

Degree 4 Scholl representations with QM and Atkin-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture

Hecke operators played a fundamental role in the arithmetic of congruence modular forms. It was shown in [\cite=tho89] [\cite=berger94] [\cite=sch97] that similarly defined Hecke operators yielded little information on genuine noncongruence forms. When the modular curve of a noncongruence subgroup Γ has a model over [formula], Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer in [\cite=a-sd] predicted a "p-adic" Hecke theory in terms of 3-term congruence relations on Fourier coefficients of weight κ cusp forms in Sκ(Γ) as follows. Suppose the cusp at ∞   is a [formula]-rational point with cusp width μ. The d-dimensional space Sκ(Γ) admits a basis whose Fourier coefficients are in a finite extension of [formula]; moreover, there is an integer M such that for each prime [formula], these Fourier coefficients are p-adically integral, that is, integral over [formula]. Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectured in [\cite=a-sd] that, given κ  ≥  2 even, for almost all primes p, Sκ(Γ) has a p-adically integral basis [formula], where q  =  e2πiz and 1  ≤  j  ≤  d, depending on p, whose Fourier coefficients satisfy the 3-term congruences

[formula]

for some algebraic integers Aj(p) satisfying the Ramanujan bound. The congruence ([\ref=eq:ASD]) is carefully explained in [\cite=a-sd] and [\cite=sch85b]. It can be summed up as the quotient [formula] is integral over [formula], as in [\cite=all05]. In what follows, this is the interpretation of ASD congruences we shall adopt. The κ = 2 case of this conjecture was verified in [\cite=a-sd] for d = 1 and discussed in [\cite=car71] using formal group language.

Scholl showed in [\cite=sch85b] that, for κ  ≥  4 even and p large enough, all p-adically integral cusp forms [formula] in Sκ(Γ) satisfy (2d + 1)-term congruences in which [formula] is the characteristic polynomial of the associated Scholl representation [formula] at [formula]. Similar statement holds for κ odd. Hence the ASD conjecture holds for d = 1. For arbitrary d, proving the ASD conjecture amounts to factoring Hp(x) as a product of d quadratic polynomials x2  -  Aj(p)x  +  Bj(p), 1  ≤  j  ≤  d, and finding a basis [formula] of Sκ(Γ) with p-adically integral coefficients such that the 3-term congruences hold for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d.

Assume that Sκ(Γ) has a 2-dimensional subspace S to which one can associate a family of compatible degree-4 Scholl representations [formula] of G over [formula]. Suppose that there is a finite extension F of [formula] and there are operators Js and Jt acting on extensions over fields in [formula] of the representation spaces of all [formula] that satisfy the QM conditions in Definition [\ref=QM] over a biquadratic [formula]. Then, as stated in Corollary [\ref=factorization], for almost all primes p they give rise to a factorization of the characteristic polynomial Hp(x) of [formula] into a product of two quadratic polynomials [formula] by choosing a u∈{s,t,st} such that p splits into two places [formula] in [formula]. Recall that [formula] are the respective characteristic polynomial of [formula] and [formula], where σu and δu are as in Theorem [\ref=quaternion].

For [formula] and unramified in [formula], let Vp be the 4-dimensional p-adic Scholl space containing the space Sp of p-adically integral forms in S as a subspace and its dual [formula] as a quotient (cf. [\cite=sch85b]). On Vp there is the action of Fp, the Frobenius at p. Scholl proved in [\cite=sch85b] that, for [formula] and [formula] unramified at p, [formula] and Fp have the same characteristic polynomial.

Assume that the operators Js and Jt also act on S, preserving forms whose Fourier coefficients are in a suitable number field K which are p-adically integral for almost all p. For such a p, their actions on Sp extend to Vp, again denoted by Js and Jt. Suppose that they satisfy the condition (a) in Definition [\ref=QM] and

(b)' for u∈{s,t,st}, the operator Ju commutes with Fp for p split in [formula], and JuFp =  - FpJu for p inert in [formula]. Here Jst  =  JsJt.

We say that Vp admits QM over [formula] for simplicity. The same argument as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=quaternion] shows that over any field in [formula], for every u∈{s,t,st}, each ±  i-eigenspace Vp,  ±  ,u of Ju is 2-dimensional, containing a form in Sp, and Jv, where v∈{s,t,st} and v  ≠  u, permutes the two eigenspaces. If p splits completely in [formula], then Vp,  ±  ,u are invariant under Fp and Jv commutes with Fp. Therefore the actions of Fp on Vp,  ±  ,u are isomorphic and hence have the same characteristic polynomial, equal to [formula]. If p does not split in [formula], choose an element u∈{s,t,st} such that p splits in [formula]. Then Vp,  ±  ,u are invariant under Fp. On the [formula]-adic side, the representation space [formula] of [formula] decomposes similarly into two ±  i-eigenspaces [formula] of Ju, each is invariant under [formula]. Moreover, viewed as [formula] invariant spaces, they are intertwined by Jv because of condition (b) in Definition [\ref=QM]. Therefore [formula] has the same characteristic polynomial on [formula].

A normalizer of Γ acts on the space S and hence Vp. Further, its action on the modular curve [formula] induces an action on the [formula]-adic cohomology group, which is the representation space of [formula]. When Js and Jt arise from normalizers of Γ, or algebraic real linear combinations of such, we conclude from the argument in [\cite=sch85b] that JuFp on Vp and [formula] on [formula] have the same characteristic polynomials. Combined with the fact that [formula] and Fp have the same characteristic polynomials, we get, by using the argument of Lemma 8 of [\cite=all05], that when p splits in [formula], Fp on Vp,  ±  ,u and [formula] on [formula] have the same characteristic polynomials [formula].

As observed above, for almost all primes p, Vp,  ±  ,u contain a nonzero [formula] with p-adically integral Fourier coefficients. They form a basis of S. It follows from [\cite=sch85b] [\cite=L5] that the ASD congruences hold, namely,

[formula]

Now we turn to the modularity of the degree 4 representations [formula] with QM over [formula] as above. Theorem [\ref=thm:exist-chi_u] says for each u∈{s,t,st}, there is a finite [formula]-adic characters χu of [formula] such that [formula] extends to a representation ηu of G. We know from Corollary 4.1.2 that all [formula] have trace 0 at the complex conjugation. If there is a large [formula] such that the representation [formula] is over a field not containing a square root of - 1, then by combining Propositions [\ref=conjugation] and [\ref=oddness], we get that ηu is odd for this and hence all [formula] because of compatibility. We then conclude from Theorem [\ref=thm:3.2.1] that the dual of [formula] is automorphic. In this case the dual of σu corresponds to an automorphic form hu of [formula] over [formula]. As σs, σt, σst have the same restrictions to [formula], the three automorphic forms hu of [formula] over [formula] for u∈{s,t,st} base change to the same automorphic form h of [formula] over [formula].

We summarize the above discussions in the theorems below.

Let [formula] be a family of compatible degree-4 Scholl representations of G associated to a 2-dimensional subspace S of Sκ(Γ) for a noncongruence subgroup Γ. Suppose that there exists a finite real extension F of [formula] and operators Js and Jt acting on the spaces of [formula] extended over fields in [formula] satisfying the QM conditions in Definition [\ref=QM] over a biquadratic field [formula]. Then for each u∈{s,t,st}, there is an automorphic form hu of [formula] such that the following L-functions have the same local factors over all primes of [formula]:

[formula]

In addition to these three automorphic interpretations, [formula] also agrees with the L-functions of an automorphic form of [formula] and an automorphic form of [formula], as remarked after Theorem [\ref=thm:3.2.1].

If [formula] is unramified at a prime p which splits in [formula], then hu is an eigenfunction of the Hecke operators at the two places [formula] of [formula] above p, and the product of the local L-factors attached to hu at these two places is

[formula]

where [formula] are the characteristic polynomials of [formula].

Keep the same notation and hypotheses as in Theorem [\ref=QMdescent]. Assume the modular curve [formula] has a model defined over [formula] such that the cusp at ∞   is a [formula]-rational point with cusp width μ. Further, assume that Js and Jt arise from algebraic real linear combinations of normalizers of Γ whose actions on Vp admit QM over [formula] for almost all p. Then there exists a finite set of primes T, including ramified primes, primes <  2κ - 2, and primes where [formula] has bad reductions, such that for each p∉T, S has a p-adically integral basis [formula] which are ±  i-eigenfunctions of Ju for some u∈{s,t,st} such that p splits in [formula]. The Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences ([\ref=eq:ASD2]) hold with A±  ,u(p) and Bu(p) coming from the characteristic polynomials [formula] of [formula] on the ±  i-eigenspaces of Ju on the space of [formula]. Moreover, (1  -  A+ ,u(p)p- s  +  Bu(p)p- 2s)- 1 and (1  -  A- ,u(p)p- s  +  Bu(p)p- 2s)- 1 are the local factors at the two places [formula] of [formula] above p of an automorphic form hu for [formula] over [formula].

Observe that the basis for which the ASD conjecture holds depends on p modulo the discriminant of [formula]. Further, the ASD congruences ([\ref=eq:ASD2]) describe congruence relations between Fourier coefficients of noncongruence forms f±  ,p and those of congruence forms hu.

Under the same assumptions as above except that the field [formula] is a quadratic extension of [formula], the same argument shows that, for almost all primes p, if each eigenspace of Js contains a nonzero form in S, then the ASD conjecture on S holds at such p.

Applications

As applications, we exhibit some examples of Scholl representations which admit QM. We use Theorem [\ref=QMdescent] to conclude the automorphy of the representation and Theorem [\ref=ASD] to conclude the ASD congruences. We expect that there is a wide variety of cases to which Theorem [\ref=thm:3.2.1] could be applied.

Old cases

We first re-establish several known automorphy results, previously proved using Faltings-Serre modularity criterion. While the new argument is more conceptual, no information on the congruence modular form giving rise to the Galois representation is revealed.

In a series of papers [\cite=lly05] [\cite=all05] [\cite=long061], a sequence of genus 0 normal subgroups, denoted by Γn, of Γ1(5) are considered. Their modular curves are n-fold covers of the modular curve for Γ1(5), ramified only at two cusps ∞   and - 2 of Γ1(5) with ramification degree n. The group Γn is noncongruence when n  ≠  1,5, its modular curve is defined over [formula] with the cusp at ∞   a [formula]-rational point, and an explicit basis for S3(Γn) with rational coefficients was constructed (cf. [\cite=all05]). To the (n - 1)-dimensional space S3(Γn) Scholl has attached a compatible family of 2(n - 1)-dimensional [formula]-adic Galois representations of G. The functions in S3(Γn) belonging to a nontrivial supergroup Γm of Γn are called "old" forms; denote by [formula] the subspace of forms in S3(Γn) orthogonal to the "old" forms. Accordingly, there is a compatible family of degree 2φ(n)-dimensional [formula]-adic representations [formula] of G attached to [formula]. Here φ(n) stands for the Euler phi-function (cf. [\cite=long061]). For almost all [formula], [formula] is crystalline with Hodge Tate weights {0, - 2}, each with multiplicity φ(n), and the action of complex conjugation has trace zero. Let [formula] and [formula]; they induce operators A* and ζ* on the cohomology level, whose actions on the space of [formula] satisfy the following relations:

[formula]

When n = 3,4,6, the degree 4 representations [formula] are automorphic and the ASD conjecture on [formula] holds.

When n = 3, A* and ζ* are both defined over [formula]. The operators J- 3: = A* and [formula] define QM over [formula] on the representation space of [formula]. The automorphy of this representation follows from Theorem [\ref=QMoverquadratic].

When n = 4, the 4-dimensional space of [formula] admits QM over [formula] by J- 1 = A* and [formula]. We can use [formula] in Theorem [\ref=QMdescent]. Similarly when n = 6, the space of [formula] admits QM over [formula] by J- 1 = A* and [formula]. In this case, [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=QMdescent] [formula] is automorphic for n  =  4 and 6.

Moreover, the ASD conjecture on [formula] holds for n  =  3,4,6 as it is easy to verify that the assumptions in Theorem [\ref=ASD] and the remark following it are satisfied.

The above automorphy argument does not work for n > 6. However, we conjecture that when n = p is an odd prime, the representation [formula] is related to a Hilbert modular form.

Another known example of 4-dimensional Scholl representation with QM by a biquadratic field has been investigated in [\cite=HLV10].

A new example with QM over a biquadratic field

The group Γ1(6) is normalized by W6, [formula] and [formula]. It is a torsion-free index-12 genus 0 subgroup of [formula] with four cusps: ∞  , 0 = W- 16  ·    ∞  , - 3 = W- 13  ·    ∞  , and - 2 = W2- 1  ·    ∞  . Its space of weight 3 cusp forms is 0-dimensional. The function [formula] is a weight 3 Eisenstein series for Γ1(6) which vanishes at every cusp except - 2.

Let [formula] and Γ be an index-6 subgroup of Γ1(6) whose modular curve is a 6-fold cover of the modular curve for Γ1(6), ramified totally at the two cusps ∞   and - 2  =  W- 12  ∞   and unramified elsewhere. I.e., Γ admits [formula] as a Hauptmodul. The space S3(Γ) has a basis 〈Fj = B(6 - j) / 6  ·  F〉5j = 1. The functions Fj with 2  ≤  j  ≤  4 are for certain supergroups of Γ, thus are regarded as "old" forms. The "new" space [formula] for Γ is spanned by

[formula]

On the p-adic side, the action of W2 on [formula] is as follows. By noting [formula], we claim

[formula]

Indeed, by definition, [formula] for some nonzero constant c, F1  =  B5 / 6F  =  c5 / 6(F|W2)5 / 6F1 / 6, and F5  =  B1 / 6F  =  c1 / 6F5 / 6(F|W2)1 / 6. Since [formula] and F has weight 3, we have F|W2W2  =   - F. Therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

To compute the constant c, we use the fact that [formula]. This gives c2  =  8 and hence c2 / 3  =  2.

Let [formula]. It is easy to verify that

[formula]

Let V be the 4-dimensional p-adic Scholl space which contains 〈F1,F5〉 as a subspace and their dual [formula] as a quotient (cf. [\cite=sch85b]). Let [formula]. With respect to a suitable basis J- 2 and J- 3 can be represented by the following matrices respectively:

[formula]

Thus J- 2 and J- 3 generate a quaternion algebra over [formula] with J2- 2 =  - I,J2- 3 =  - I,J- 3J- 2 =  - J- 2J- 3. It is easy to check that

F1 and F5 are eigenvectors of J- 3 with eigenvalues ±  i;

F1  ±  2F5 are eigenvectors of J- 2 with eigenvalues ±  i;

F1  ±  2iF5 are eigenvectors of J6 with eigenvalues ±  i.

We now turn to the [formula]-adic side. Under the action of W2, B  ↦   - 8 / B. This gives rise to an involution on the modular curves for Γ1(6) since W2 normalizes Γ1(6). Consider two elliptic surfaces EΓ1(6) and EW- 12Γ1(6)W2 fibred over the modular curve XΓ1(6) parametrized by B defined by the following equations:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then

[formula]

gives a 2-isogeny from EΓ1(6) to EW- 12Γ1(6)W2.

By letting t6 = B we obtain an explicit defining equation for the elliptic surface [formula] fibred over the modular curve of Γ. A similar argument yields the following degree-2 isogeny between EΓ and EW- 12ΓW2: Again, W2 normalizes Γ and it gives rise to the following map

[formula]

Also on EΓ and EW- 12ΓW2, we have

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that

[formula]

where the ζ on the left acts on EW- 12ΓW2 and the one on the right acts on EΓ.

The composition [formula] is an isogeny defined over [formula]. Let T̂- 2 denote its dual isogeny.

We first note that the above map T- 2 induces a natural homomorphism g1 from the parabolic cohomology [formula] to that of XW- 12ΓW2. Here [formula] is the inclusion map and [formula] is the natural projection and h0 is the restriction of h to [formula]. We further let w2:XΓ  →  XW- 12ΓW2 denote the isomorphism which sends t to [formula]. Compared with T- 2, this map is on the base curve level. Using w2, we have a natural isomorphism

[formula]

and the cohomology on the right is isomorphic to the parabolic cohomology attached to weight 3 cusp forms of W -  12ΓW2. The composition [formula] is an endomorphism on [formula] and is denoted by T- 2 again. On [formula] the map (T- 2)2 =  - 2 ~ id is induced by the fiber-wise multiplication by 2 map [formula].

Denote by [formula] the 4-dimensional [formula]-adic Scholl representation of G corresponding to the "new" forms of S3(Γ) (cf. [\cite=long061]). Let [formula] and let J- 3 denote [formula] on [formula]. As linear operators on the representation space of [formula], J- 2 and J- 3 generate a quaternion group. We know from the above discussions that the actions of [formula] are defined over [formula] for [formula]. Choose the field F in Theorem [\ref=QMdescent] to be [formula]. The space of [formula] over fields in [formula] is endowed with QM over [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=QMdescent], we conclude the automorphy of [formula].

We have also seen that J- 2 and J- 3 act on the space 〈F1,F5〉 and the space Vp admits QM over [formula]. Since J- 2 and J- 3 arise from normalizers of Γ1(6), by Theorems [\ref=QMdescent] and [\ref=ASD], we have

The representation [formula] is automorphic, and the ASD congruences hold on the space 〈F1,F5〉.

In particular, [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], which corresponds to an automorphic representation of [formula], where χ- 2 is a character of [formula]. Similar to [\cite=all05], we conclude this section by exhibiting, from numerical data, a congruence modular form f which gives rise to η with χ- 2  =  ξ1ξ2 being the product of the following two characters of [formula]: ξ1 is a quartic character of [formula] and ξ2 is the quadratic character of [formula].

To motivate the expression for f, we list explicit factorizations of the characteristic polynomials of [formula] at small primes.

[formula]

The congruence form f(z) is a Hecke eigenform in S3(Γ0(576),( - 6 /   ·  )) whose Fourier coefficients occur at positive integers coprime to 24. Express it as a linear combination of forms fj whose Fourier coefficients occur at integers congruent to j mod 24 as follows:

where [formula] and [formula]. Here

which span a space invariant under W9 and W64. The remaining forms f1,f11,f17,f19 are uniquely determined by applying the Hecke operators to the eigenform f. Listed below are their initial Fourier coefficients:

[formula]

Choosing different signs of i,j,k gives rise to 8 eigenforms that are conjugate to each other under G.
