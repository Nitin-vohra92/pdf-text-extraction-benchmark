Multigraded Fujita Approximation

Introduction

Let X be an irreducible variety of dimension d over an algebraically closed field [formula], and let D be a (Cartier) divisor on X. When X is projective, the following limit, which measures how fast the dimension of the section space [formula] grows, is called the volume of D:

[formula]

One says that D is big if [formula]. It turns out that the volume is an interesting numerical invariant of a big divisor ([\cite=Laz]), and it plays a key role in several recent works in birational geometry ([\cite=BDPP], [\cite=Tsu], [\cite=HM], [\cite=Tak]).

When D is ample, one can show that [formula], the self-intersection number of D. This is no longer true for a general big divisor D, since Dd may even be negative. However, it was shown by Fujita [\cite=Fuj] that the volume of a big divisor can always be approximated arbitrarily closely by the self-intersection number of an ample divisor on a birational modification of X. This theorem, known as Fujita approximation, has several implications on the properties of volumes, and is also a crucial ingredient in [\cite=BDPP] (see [\cite=Laz] for more details).

In their recent paper [\cite=LM], Lazarsfeld and Musta obtained, among other things, a generalization of Fujita approximation to graded linear series. Recall that a graded linear series [formula] on a (not necessarily projective) variety X associated to a divisor D consists of finite dimensional vector subspaces

[formula]

for each k  ≥  0, with [formula], such that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Here the product on the left denotes the image of [formula] under the multiplication map [formula]. In order to state the Fujita approximation for [formula], they defined, for each fixed positive integer p, a graded linear series [formula] which is the sub graded linear series of [formula] generated by Wp:

[formula]

Then under mild hypotheses, they showed that the volume of [formula] approaches the volume of [formula] as p  →    ∞  . See [\cite=LM] for the precise statement, as well as [\cite=LM] for how this is equivalent to the original statement of Fujita when X is projective and [formula] is the complete graded linear series associated to a big divisor D (i.e. [formula] for all k  ≥  0).

The goal of this note is to generalize the Fujita approximation theorem to multigraded linear series. We will adopt the following notations from [\cite=LM]: let [formula] be divisors on X. For [formula] we write [formula], and we put [formula].

A multigraded linear series [formula] on X associated to the Di's consists of finite-dimensional vector subspaces

[formula]

for each [formula], with [formula], such that

[formula]

where the multiplication on the left denotes the image of [formula] under the natural map [formula].

Given [formula], denote by [formula] the singly graded linear series associated to the divisor [formula] given by the subspaces [formula]. Then put

[formula]

(assuming that this quantity is finite). It will also be convenient for us to consider [formula] when [formula], given by

[formula]

Our multigraded Fujita approximation, similar to the singly-graded version, is going to state that (under suitable conditions) the volume of [formula] can be approximated by the volume of the following finitely generated sub multigraded linear series of [formula]:

Given a multigraded linear series [formula] and a positive integer p, define [formula] to be the sub multigraded linear series of [formula] generated by all [formula] with [formula], or concretely

[formula]

We now state our multigraded Fujita approximation when [formula] is a complete multigraded linear series, since this is the case of most interest and allows for a more streamlined statement. We will point out in Remark [\ref=r:assumptions] afterward what assumptions on [formula] are actually needed in the proof.

Let X be an irreducible projective variety of dimension d, and let [formula] be big divisors on X. Let [formula] be the complete multigraded linear series associated to the Di's, namely

[formula]

for each [formula]. Then given any ε > 0, there exists an integer p0 = p0(ε) having the property that if p  ≥  p0, then

[formula]

for all [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t:main]

The main tool in our proof is the theory of Okounkov bodies developed systematically in [\cite=LM]. Given a graded linear series [formula] on a d-dimensional variety X, its Okounkov body [formula] is a convex body in [formula] that encodes many asymptotic invariants of [formula], the most prominent one being the volume of [formula], which is precisely d! times the Euclidean volume of [formula]. The idea first appeared in Okounkov's papers [\cite=Oko96] and [\cite=Oko03] in the case of complete linear series of ample line bundles on a projective variety. Later it was further developed and applied to much more general graded linear series by Lazarsfeld-Musta [\cite=LM], and also independently by Kaveh-Khovanskii [\cite=KK08] [\cite=KK09].

Let [formula], and let [formula] be the set of all points in T with rational coordinates. The fraction inside [\eqref=eq:1] is invariant under scaling of [formula] due to homogeneity, hence it is enough to prove [\eqref=eq:1] for [formula].

Let [formula] be the global Okounkov cone of [formula] as in [\cite=LM], and let [formula] be the projection map. For each [formula] we write [formula] for the fiber [formula]. We also define in a similar fashion the convex cone [formula] and the convex bodies [formula]. By [\cite=LM],

[formula]

Note that although [\cite=LM] requires [formula] to be in the relative interior of T, here we know that [\eqref=eq:2] holds even for those [formula] in the boundary of T because the big cone of X is open and [formula] was assumed to be the complete multigraded linear series. By the singly-graded Fujita approximation, [formula] can be approximated arbitrarily closely by [formula] if p is sufficiently large. (Here by [formula] we mean [formula] restricted to the [formula] direction, which certainly contains [formula].) Hence given any finite subset [formula] and any ε' > 0, we have

[formula]

as soon as p is sufficiently large.

Because the function [formula] is uniformly continuous on T, given any ε' > 0, we can partition T into a union of polytopes with disjoint interiors [formula], in such a way that the vertices of each Ti all have rational coordinates, and on each Ti we have a constant Mi such that

[formula]

Let S be the set of vertices of all the Ti's. Then as we saw in the end of the previous paragraph, as soon as p is sufficiently large we have

[formula]

We claim that this implies

[formula]

To show this, it suffices to verify it on each of the Ti's. Let [formula] be the vertices of Ti. Then each [formula] can be written as a convex combination of the vertices: [formula] where each tj  ≥  0 and [formula]. Since [formula] is convex, we have

[formula]

where the sum on the right means the Minkowski sum. By [\eqref=eq:3] and [\eqref=eq:4], the volume of each [formula] is at least Mi  -  ε', hence by the Brunn-Minkowski inequality [\cite=KK08], we have

[formula]

This combined with [\eqref=eq:3] shows that [\eqref=eq:5] is true on [formula], hence it is true on [formula] since the Ti's cover T.

Since [\eqref=eq:1] follows from [\eqref=eq:5] by choosing a suitable ε', the proof is thus complete.

In the statement of Theorem [\ref=t:main] we assume that [formula] is the complete multigraded linear series associated to big divisors. But in fact since the main tool we used in the proof is the theory of Okounkov bodies established in [\cite=LM], in particular [\cite=LM], the really indispensable assumptions on [formula] are the same as those in [\cite=LM] (which they called Conditions (A') and (B'), or (C')). The only place in the proof where we invoke that we are working with a complete multigraded linear series is the sentence right after [\eqref=eq:2], where we want to say that [\eqref=eq:2] holds not only in the relative interior of T but also in its boundary. Hence if [formula] is only assumed to satisfy Conditions (A') and (B'), or (C'), then given any ε > 0 and any compact set C contained in [formula], there exists an integer p0 = p0(C,ε) such that if p  ≥  p0 then

[formula]

for all [formula].
