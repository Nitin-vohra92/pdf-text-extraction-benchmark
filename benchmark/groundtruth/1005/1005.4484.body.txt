A note on special orthogonal groups following Waldspurger

Let G be a special orthogonal group [formula] or [formula], p,n  ≥  1, q  ≥  0. Let G' be [formula] or [formula], viewed as a subgroup of G as usual. Then for every irreducible Casselman-Wallach smooth representation V of G, and V' of G', one has that

[formula]

Here "[formula]" stands for the completed projective tensor product of Hausdorff locally convex topological vector spaces.

We follow the general set-up of [\cite=SZ].

Let (A,τ) be a (finite-dimensional) commutative involutive algebra over [formula], and let E be a (non-degenerate finitely generated) Hermitian A-module, with a Hermitian form

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the group of A-linear automorphisms of E preserving the form 〈  ,  〉E. Write [formula], viewed as a real vector space. Denote by [formula] the subgroup of [formula] consisting of pairs (g,δ) such that either

[formula]

or

[formula]

This contains [formula] as a subgroup of index two.

First assume that (A,τ) is simple. If τ is nontrivial, we put

[formula]

and

[formula]

Otherwise, τ is trivial and [formula] or [formula]. Then we have [formula], and [formula], in the usual notations. We shall put

[formula]

and following Waldspurger [\cite=Wa]

[formula]

and

[formula]

In general, write

[formula]

as a product of simple commutative involutive algebras over [formula]. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

is naturally a Hermitian Ai-module. We put

[formula]

and

[formula]

The latter ([formula]) contains the former as a subgroup of index two. Denote by [formula] the quadratic character on [formula] with kernel [formula]. Likewise we define a group [formula] which contains [formula] as a subgroup of index two. Denote by [formula] the quadratic character on [formula] with kernel [formula].

Write

[formula]

for the Lie algebra of [formula] (which is also the Lie algebra of [formula]). Let the groups [formula] and [formula] act on [formula] and [formula] by

[formula]

Also they act on E by

[formula]

It is by now standard (see for example [\cite=SZ]) that Theorem [\ref=main] is implied by the first assertion of the following theorem in the case of [formula] or [formula], τ trivial.

One has that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that (g,δ)  ↦  (δg,δ) is a group isomorphism from [formula] onto [formula] fixing [formula]. Thus Theorem [\ref=vanish1] is equivalent to

One has that

[formula]

and

[formula]

For E as in [\eqref=Eproduct], put

[formula]

We argue by induction on [formula] and so will assume that Theorem [\ref=vanish1] (and hence Theorem [\ref=vanish2]) holds whenever [formula] is smaller.

Without loss of generality, in the remaining part of this note, assume that (A,τ) is simple and E is faithful as an A-module. Let x be a semisimple element of [formula] or [formula]. Denote by Ax the subalgebra of [formula] generated by A, x and xτ. Here τ is the involution of [formula] given by

[formula]

Then Ax is again a commutative involutive algebra over [formula], and Ex: = E is naturally a Hermitian Ax-module. In the notations of this note, the following lemma is the first key observation of Waldspurger [\cite=Wa].

As in [\cite=SZ], Harish-Chandra's method of descent and the above lemma imply the following

By the first assertion of the above proposition, [\eqref=ev2] will imply [\eqref=ev1]. So we only need to prove [\eqref=ev2].

Let v be a non-degenerate element of E (i.e., 〈v,v〉E is invertible in A), and denote by Ev the orthogonal complement of v in E. The second key observation of Waldspurger [\cite=Wa] is the following

Again Harish-Chandra's method of descent and the above lemma imply the following

The (same and key) argument of [\cite=SZ] (reduction within the null cone) works in the setting of this note and we have

Now Propositions [\ref=reduc1] and [\ref=reduc2] imply that the hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=reducn] is satisfied. (This completes the step of reduction to the null cone.) Together with Proposition [\ref=reducn], they imply that [\eqref=evt] always holds. Then a general principle due to Aizenbud and Gourevitch ([\cite=AGS]) implies that [\eqref=ev2] also holds.
