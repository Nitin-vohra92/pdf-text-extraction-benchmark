Black Holes and the Strong CP Problem

Introduction

In quantum chromodynamics (QCD)[\cite=generalrefs] - the generally accepted theory of quarks and gluons - there was a prediction that there should be a light pseudoscalar particle associated with the conserved current associated with global chiral rotations of the quarks. No such meson was observed, and this was called the "U(1) problem". It was realized that the quantum effects spoiled the conservation of the quark axial current, making its divergence proportional to [formula] where Fμν is the SU(3) field strength, [formula] its Hodge dual, and the trace is taken over SU(3) indices.

This divergence corresponds to a CP-violating Lagrangian density of the form

[formula]

where g is the SU(3) gauge coupling constant, and θ is a free parameter. Overall, this expression is proportional to the Pontryagin density, which on integration over spacetime is an integer topological charge representing the number n of times that S3 (considered as physical space [formula] plus a point at infinity) nontrivially "winds around" SU(3). The physical gauge-invariant vacuum is constructed as a superposition of states of winding number n, each weighted by einθ with the sum running from n =  -   ∞   to n =   ∞   in order to preserve gauge invariance under the "large" gauge transformations which are not continuously connected to the identity. θ is not determined by the theory, and can, in principle, take any value between 0 and 2π.

When the weak interactions and quark masses are included, θ is shifted by an amount arg(det(m)) where m is the quark mass matrix, but the basic form of the expression remains the same and unless the shifted θ is zero (or π, but this subtlety will not concern us here) this term leads to a (CP-violating) electric dipole moment |dn| for the neutron. The present upper bound |dn| < 2.9  ×  10- 26e  ·  cm, where e is magnitude of the electron charge[\cite=neutron-edm] , implies θ < 10- 9. The puzzle of why θ is so small is the "strong CP problem".

A wide variety of solutions have been proposed, generally involving new physics. Many postulate particles called axions[\cite=generalrefs] associated with an additional U(1) symmetry which can be used to rotate θ to zero. These have not been observed and are in general quite constrained by astrophysical considerations. Other ideas include adding dimensions to the usual 3+1 that we know [\cite=stdiml], or making them some fractional value a little less than four [\cite=stdimf]. Two-dimensional fundamental objects (2-branes) [\cite=branes] have been considered, as have microscopic wormholes [\cite=worm], hypothetical new interactions [\cite=newint], new (non-axion) particles [\cite=newpart], supersymmetry [\cite=SUSY], and magnetic monopoles[\cite=monopCP]. It has also been claimed that certain choices of regularization techniques could solve the problem[\cite=reg]. It has even been suggested that a staggering 1032 standard model copies could do the job [\cite=gf]. It has also been argued[\cite=Fort] that the strong CP problem might naturally not appear at all if one simply reformulated QCD in terms of holonomies (gauge invariant traces of Wilson loops). This list of ideas and references is not meant to be complete, but rather to show that the problem has driven theorists to a wide range of quite exotic scenarios in the search for an explanation. Despite all this creativity, the strong CP problem is still generally considered unsolved.

The point of this paper is that the problem could be resolved without unobserved exotica, and without spoiling the solution of the U(1) problem, if the spacetime integral of the Pontryagin density were somehow to be zero - something I now argue will happen if one allows for the existence of even one black hole.

In elementary particle physics one usually ignores gravity, and works with quantum field theory in flat and topologically trivial spacetime. While quantum field theory in a general curved spacetime[\cite=qftc] is highly nontrivial, the question asked here only requires a little topology.

First let us recall where the instantons come from that lead to the strong CP problem[\cite=Jackiw-and-Rebbi] [\cite=CDG]. We look for SU(3) gauge field configurations Aμ which go to the identity (up to a gauge transformation) at spatial infinity, with all the directions at infinity identified. These turn out to fall into topologically distinct classes labelled by elements of π3(SU(3)).

For completeness, and to make clear the origin of the π3(SU(3)), let us repeat the argument in more detail. Pure gauge configurations are of the form Aμ = iU†(x)∂μU(x) where U(x) takes its values in SU(3) and [formula]. Using the gauge freedom to set A0 = 0, which essentially means we consider time-independent fields, only partially fixes the gauge. If we require [formula] as the spatial [formula] goes to infinity in all directions this is the same as looking for maps from spatial [formula] compactified at infinity (that is, S3) into SU(3). Instantons and correspond to homotopy classes
