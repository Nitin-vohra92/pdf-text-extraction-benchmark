Embedded Plateau Problem

Introduction

The Plateau problem asks the existence of an area minimizing disk for a given simple closed curve in a manifold M. This problem was solved for [formula] by Douglas [\cite=Do], and Rado [\cite=Ra] in the early 1930s. Later, it was generalized by Morrey for Riemannian manifolds [\cite=Mo]. Then, regularity (nonexistence of branch points) of these solutions was shown by Osserman [\cite=Os], Gulliver [\cite=Gu] and Alt [\cite=Al]. However, these area minimizing disks may not be embedded, even though the curves bound an embedded disk in the ambient manifold. They might have self intersections (See Figure 1).

In the following decades, the question of embeddedness of the area minimizing disk was studied: For which curves are the area minimizing disks embedded? The first such condition ensuring the embeddedness of the disk was due to Rado. In the early 1930s, he showed that if the curve can be projected onto a convex curve in a plane, then it bounds a unique embedded minimal disk which is a graph over the plane. Osserman conjectured that if the curve is extreme (lies in the boundary of its convex hull), then the area minimizing disk spanning the curve must be embedded. In the late 1970s, Gulliver and Spruck proved that if the total curvature of an extreme curve is less than 4π then the solution to the Plateau problem is embedded [\cite=GS]. Later, Almgren-Simon [\cite=AS] and Tomi-Tromba [\cite=TT] showed the existence of an embedded solution for extreme curves. Then, Meeks and Yau proved the Osserman's conjecture in full generality: Any solution to the Plateau problem for an extreme curve must be embedded [\cite=MY1]. Recently, Ekholm, White, and Wienholtz generalized Gulliver-Spruck's embeddedness result by removing extremeness condition from the curves [\cite=EWW]. Also, recently, Hass, Lagarias and Thurston [\cite=HLT] gave interesting results about the isoperimetric inequalities for embedded disks in [formula].

On the other hand, a different version of the Plateau problem was studied after 1960s. This version asks the existence of area minimizing surface for a given simple closed curve. If there is no restriction on the topological type of the surface, Geometric Measure Theory gives a positive solution for this question. Federer et al solved the problem and showed the existence of a surface which minimizes area among all surfaces with the given boundary [\cite=Fe]. Moreover, any such surface must be embedded for any simple closed curve.

If we come back to the disk case, there is a relevant result about the same question due to Meeks-Yau [\cite=MY3]. They give a necessary condition for a sufficiently smooth simple closed curve in a 3-manifold to bound a embedded minimal disk. In particular, they showed that for a sufficiently smooth simple closed curve Γ in a 3-manifold M, in order to bound a strictly stable embedded minimal disk in M, Γ must be an extreme curve in some sense (See Theorem 4.1).

In this paper, we are approaching to the embeddedness question from a different direction. Instead of considering the question that "for which curves must the area minimizing disks be embedded?", we analyze the structure of the surface which minimizes area among the embedded disks whose boundary is any given simple closed curve.

Embedded Plateau Problem: Let Γ be a simple closed curve in a manifold M, and let Γ bound an embedded disk. Does there exist an embedded minimal disk which minimizes the area among the embedded disks with boundary Γ?

This is the most general case for a curve to bound an embedded minimal disk. This is because if Γ does not bound any embedded disk in M, then, of course, there is no embedded minimal disk bounding Γ at all. Our main result is as follows:

Theorem 3.1: Let Γ be a simple closed curve bounding an embedded disk in a closed 3-manifold M. Then, there exists a disk Σ in M with ∂Σ  =  Γ such that Σ minimizes the area among all the embedded disks bounding Γ. Moreover, Σ is minimal and smoothly embedded everywhere except where the boundary Γ meets the interior of Σ.

In particular, if Σ is as in the theorem, then there is a continuous parametrization φ:D2  →  M of Σ, with φ(D2)  =  Σ and φ(∂D2)  =  Γ, such that φ is smooth embedding on D2  -  φ- 1(Γ) and the image Σ  -  Γ is a minimal surface (See Figure 1). [formula] is known as the coincidence set in the literature (See Remark 3.2). If [formula], then Σ is a smooth embedded minimal disk in M with boundary Γ. We call such a disk Σ as a pseudo-area minimizing disk.

The outline of the technique is summarized as follows: Let Γ be any simple closed curve bounding an embedded disk in a manifold M. By drilling out a small neighborhood Ni of Γ and changing the metric in a very small neighborhood of the boundary, we can get a manifold Mi with a convex boundary ∂Mi. For a curve Γi  ⊂  ∂Mi homotopic to Γ in M, there is an area minimizing embedded disk Di in Mi with ∂Di  =  Γi by [\cite=MY2]. When Ni gets smaller, we get a sequence of embedded disks {Di} in M where the areas of the disks are approaching to the minimum area for embedded disks, and ∂Di  =  Γi  →  Γ. Then, the idea is to obtain a limiting surface out of this sequence and to analyze its structure.

By using the standard generalizations on M to ensure the embeddedness of the solutions of the Plateau problem in Meeks-Yau setting, we also give a generalization of the main result to a homogeneously regular 3-manifold M with sufficiently convex boundary (See Theorem 3.2).

On the other hand, by slightly modifying the pseudo-area minimizing disk Σ with boundary Γ, it is easy to get a smooth, embedded disk Σ' with boundary Γ such that Σ' is minimal everywhere except for a very small region (See Corollary 3.3).

The organization of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, we cover some basic results which will be used in the remaining part of the paper. In section 3, we prove the main result. Then in section 4, we make some final remarks.

Preliminaries

In this section, we will overview the basic results which we use in the following sections. For more details on these, see[\cite=CM] or [\cite=HS].

Let M be a 3-manifold. A minimal disk in M is a disk whose mean curvature vanishes everyhere. An area minimizing disk in M is a disk which has the smallest area among the disks in M with the same boundary. A pseudo-area minimizing disk in M is a disk which has the smallest area among the embedded disks in M with the same boundary, and has no transverse self-intersection.

[\cite=HS] Let M be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with boundary. Then M is mean convex (or M has sufficiently convex boundary) if the following conditions hold.

∂M is piecewise smooth.

Each smooth subsurface of ∂M has nonnegative curvature with respect to inward normal.

There exists a Riemannian manifold N such that M is isometric to a submanifold of N and each smooth subsurface S of ∂M extends to a smooth embedded surface S' in N such that [formula].

[\cite=MY1], [\cite=HS] Let M be a Riemannian 3-manifold. Then M is homogeneously regular if the sectional curvature is bounded above, and injectivity radius is bounded away from 0.

In this paper, we will use the following definition for extreme curves. Note that this definition is different from the one in the literature (lying in the boundary of its convex hull), and our definition is more general than the other one.

Γ  ⊂  M is an extreme curve if it is a curve in the boundary of a mean convex submanifold in M.

Now, we state the main facts which we use in the following sections.

[\cite=MY1], [\cite=MY2] Let M be a compact manifold with sufficiently convex boundary, and Γ be a nullhomotopic simple closed curve in ∂M. Then, there exists an area minimizing disk D in M with ∂D  =  Γ. Moreover, unless D  ⊂  ∂M, all such disks are properly embedded (i.e. the boundary of the disk is in the boundary of the manifold) in M and they are pairwise disjoint.

Now, we state two lemmas due to Hass and Scott [\cite=HS], which we use in the following sections.

([\cite=HS], Lemma 3.1) Let M be a closed Riemannian 3-manifold. Then, there exists an ε > 0 such that for any x∈M, the ball Bε(x) of radius ε about x in M has the following property: If Γ  ⊂  ∂Bε(x) is a simple closed curve, and if D is an area minimizing disk in M with ∂D  =  Γ, then D is properly embedded in Bε(x).

([\cite=HS], Lemma 3.6) Let M be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold with strictly convex boundary. Let {Di} be a sequence of properly embedded area minimizing disks in M which have uniformly bounded area. Then there is a subsequence {Dij} which converges to a collection of properly embedded area minimizing disks. If {Di} has a limit point, then the collection is not empty.

Main Result

In this section, we will prove the main result of the paper.

Let Γ be a simple closed curve which is the boundary of an embedded disk E in a closed Riemannian 3-manifold M.

First, we will construct a sequence of embedded almost area minimizing disks {Di} in M with ∂Di  =  Γi and Γi  →  Γ by using the techniques of Calegari and Gabai in [\cite=Ga] and [\cite=CG]. Then, by taking the limit of this sequence as in [\cite=Ga] and [\cite=HS], we will get a limit object Δ. Then, by analyzing this object, we will show the main result of the paper.

The Sequence

Take a sequence of open solid tori {Ni} which are neighborhoods of Γ. That is, fix a sufficiently small ε > 0, and let [formula], where Nε(.) represents the open ε neighborhood in M. Then N1  ⊃  N2  ⊃  ....  ⊃  Ni  ⊃  Ni + 1  ⊃  ... and [formula].

Now, let Mi  =  M  -  Ni. Clearly, {Mi} are compact 3-manifolds with torus boundary. Moreover, M1  ⊂  M2  ⊂  ...  ⊂  Mi  ⊂  Mi + 1  ⊂  ... and [formula]. Also, note that for δ  <  ε, [formula] is a torus, and let [formula] be a function such that [formula] where |.| represents the area in M. Since [formula] degenerates into Γ as δ  →  0, then F(δ)  →  0 as δ  →  0. Hence, |∂Mi|  →  0 as i  →    ∞  .

Now, we will construct a sequence of area minimizing disks in M. Let E be the disk in M bounding Γ. Modify E if necessary so that E is transverse to ∂Mi. Then, let [formula]. In other words, for each i, let i be a simple closed curve in ∂Mi  =  ∂Ni which is isotopic to the core curve Γ in the solid torus Ni.

Consider the manifolds with torus boundary Mi  ⊂  Mi + 1. Change the metric of Mi + 1 in Mi + 1  -  Mi so that Mi + 1 becomes a compact manifold with sufficiently convex boundary, say i + 1 (Mi + 1 with a new metric). Note that the new metric is the same with original metric of M in Mi part. As i + 1 is mean convex, by Lemma 2.1, there exists an area minimizing disk i + 1 in i + 1 with ∂i + 1  =  i + 1 (See Figure 2).

Now, consider the intersection [formula]. By modifying Mi if necessary, we can assume the intersection is transverse, and it is a collection of simple closed curves. By construction, the curves in the intersection are either essential in ∂Mi and isotopic to Γ in M, or not essential in Γ. Let {α1,α2,...,αn} be essential curves, and let {β1,β2,...,βm} be the nonessential ones. By construction, we know that n  ≥  1, and m  ≥  0. Without loss of generality, let α1 be the innermost curve in i + 1 among {α1,α2,...,αn}. Let Ei be the subdisk in i + 1 with ∂Ei  =  α1.

Now, consider that ∂Ei  ⊂  ∂Mi and Ei  ⊂  Mi + 1. If Ei  ⊂  Mi, then define the ith element of the desired sequence Di  =  Ei. Otherwise, [formula], and consists of planar surfaces whose boundary is some curves in {β1,β2,...,βm}. Now replace these planar surfaces in Ei with the isotopic surface in ∂Mi with the same boundary. Then, smooth out the corners into Mi and push the parts in ∂Mi into Mi so that surgered Ei, say Êi, becomes a disk in Mi. Hence, define Γi as α1, and Di as Êi.

By construction {Di} has the following properties:

Di is a properly embedded smooth disk in Mi, i.e. [formula].

|Di|  <  Ti  +  2|∂Mi| where Ti is the infimum of the areas of the embedded disks in M with boundary Γi.

By construction, the first property is clear. To see the second property, first consider that Ei is the area minimizing disk in i + 1, and the metric of i + 1 coincides with the original metric on M in Mi. Clearly, Ti'  <  Ti  +  |∂Mi| where Ti' is the infimum of the areas of the embedded disks in Mi with boundary Γi. As Di obtained by modifying [formula], by patching the missing parts from ∂Mi and smoothing out corners. By [\cite=MY2], smoothing out the folding curves decreases the area, hence [formula]. Since [formula], the second property follows.

It is clear that Di may not be area minimizing in M, however, with the second property, they can be thought as almost area minimizing in M. Note that [formula] is area minimizing in M, so only the patched parts of Di (replacements of [formula]) are not area minimizing, which are a very small part of Di. This is because it is reasonable to think Di as almost area minimizing.

Now, let T be the infimum of the areas of the embedded disks in M with boundary Γ. Let Ai be the infimum of the areas of embedded annuli with boundary [formula]. By construction, Ti  ≤  T  +  Ai and T  ≤  Ti  +  Ai. Since Γi  →  Γ, Ai  →  0 as i  →    ∞  . This implies Ti  →  T as i  →    ∞  . Hence, by the second property and |∂Mi|  →  0, |Di|  →  T as i  →    ∞  .

To sum up, we constructed a sequence of embedded smooth disks {Di} in M such that ∂Di  =  Γi  ⊂  ∂Mi with Γi  →  Γ and |Di|  →  T as i  →    ∞   where T is the infimum of the areas of the embedded disks in M with boundary Γ.

The Limit

In this section, by using the techniques of [\cite=Ga] and [\cite=HS], from the sequence {Di} of almost area minimizing embedded disks in a M, we will get a limit object Δ which can be thought as a special topological limit. Then, by using this object, we will prove the main result of the paper. The following is a modified version of a definition of special topological limit due to Gabai [\cite=Ga].

A collection of pairwise disjoint embedded surfaces Δ in a Riemannian manifold M is called the topological limit of the sequence {Di} of embedded surfaces in M if

Δ  =  { x =  lim xi |  xi∈Di,{xi}M }

Δ  =  { x =  lim xni |  xi∈Di,{xi}{xni}M }

In other words, the sequence {Di} is such that the set of the limits of all {xi} with xi∈M and the set of the limits of the subsequences are the same. This is an essential condition on Δ to be a collection of pairwise disjoint embedded surfaces. Otherwise, one might simply take a sequence such that D2i + 1  =  Σ1 and D2i  =  Σ2 where Σ1 and Σ2 are intersecting disks. Then, without the first condition (Δ being just the union of limit points), [formula] in this case, which is not a collection of pairwise disjoint embedded disks. However, the first condition forces Δ to be either Σ1 or Σ2, not the union of them. By similar reasons, this condition is also important to make sure the embeddedness of the disks in the collection Δ.

Now, we will show that there is a subsequence of the sequence constructed in previous part which gives a topological limit Δ. Then, by showing that the limit Δ is a collection of disks, we will prove the main result of the paper.

Let Γ be a simple closed curve bounding an embedded disk in a closed 3-manifold M. Then, there exists a disk Σ in M with ∂Σ  =  Γ such that Σ minimizes the area among the embedded disks bounding Γ. Moreover, Σ is minimal and smoothly embedded everywhere except where the boundary Γ meets the interior of Σ.

Step 1: Δ is not empty.

Step 2: Let Z = {zi} be a countable dense subset of Δ where [formula]. Then, after passing to a subsequence of {Dj} the following holds. For any i, there exists a sequence {Eij} of embedded disks Eij  ⊂  Dj which converges to a smoothly embedded disk Ei such that zi∈Ei.

Hence, with above construction, we get [formula]. Now, we will analyze the structure of the limit object Δ. In particular, we will prove that Δ is a union of "disks" which minimize area among the embedded disks. Now, clearly Γ  ⊂  Δ. We want to specify some parts of Γ which bumps into interior of Δ. In other words, define the coincidence set λ  ⊂  Γ such that

[formula]

Here, j is the induced path metric on Dj. In other words, a point in the boundary Γ is in the coincidence set λ, if there exists a sequence {zj} in Δ which is away from the boundary Γ and zj  →  x. Hence by definition, the coincidence set λ corresponds to some closed subsegments of Γ which meets the interior part of Δ. It can be thought as the defective parts of the embedded minimal disks we are constructing. Note that λ might be empty.

Step 3: Δ  -  Γ is a minimal surface in M.

Step 4: Δ is a collection of disks which minimize area among the embedded disks.

Hence, by taking one of the Σi piece in Δ given by Step 4, we get a continuous map φ:D2  →  M with φ(D2)  =  Σi and φ(∂D2)  =  Γ. Moreover, φ is a smooth embedding on D2  -  φ- 1(Γ), and Σi  -  Γ is an embedded minimal surface. The proof follows.

On the other hand, this result is true for more general manifolds, namely homogeneously regular 3-manifolds with sufficiently convex boundary. In Section 6 of [\cite=HS], one might find the reasons why we need the conditions of being homogeneously regular and being sufficiently convex to extend these results.

Let Γ be a simple closed curve bounding an embedded disk in a homogeneously regular 3-manifold M with sufficiently convex boundary. Then, there exists a disk Σ in M with ∂Σ  =  Γ such that Σ minimizes the area among the embedded disks bounding Γ. Moreover, Σ is embedded in the interior, and it is smooth and minimal everywhere except where the boundary Γ meets the interior of Σ.

In other words, this theorem applies to closed 3-manifolds, compact 3-manifolds with sufficiently convex boundary, homogeneously regular non-compact 3-manifolds, and homogeneously regular non-compact 3-manifolds with sufficiently convex boundary.

The structure of the pseudo-area minimizing disks given by the main theorem also tells us how to construct nearby special smoothly embedded disks with the same boundary.

Let M be a closed 3-manifold or a homogeneously regular 3-manifold with sufficiently convex boundary. Let Γ be a simple closed curve bounding an embedded disk in M. Then, for any given ε > 0, there exist a smooth, embedded disk Σε in M with ∂Σε  =  Γ such that |Σε|  <  CΓ  +  ε and there exists a small region R in Σε where |R| < ε with Σε - R is a minimal surface. Here |.| represents the area, and CΓ is the infimum of the areas of the embedded disks in M with boundary Γ.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we studied the embeddedness question of minimal disks in 3-manifolds. Unlike the many results considering the question that "for which curves must the area minimizing disks be embedded?" in the literature, we analyzed the structure of the surface which minimizes area among the embedded disks whose boundary is any given simple closed curve. Hence, we showed that among all the embedded disks with fixed boundary, the area minimizer (pseudo-area minimizing disk) exists, however it may not be an embedded disk. It is a disk in the manifold, and it only fails to be an embedding along the coincidence set where the boundary bumps nontransversely into the interior. Other than this exceptional part, the disk is a smoothly embedded minimal surface. Hence, for any simple closed curve in a 3-manifold M, we construct a canonical almost embedded disk in M among the embedded disks bounding the given curve.

Intuitively, one might think the pseudo-area minimizing disk Σ in the following way. Let D be the area minimizing disk M with boundary Γ. As in Figure 1, D may not be embedded, and it might have self intersection. Then, one can get Σ from D by pushing the self intersection into the boundary. The interesting fact here is that Σ is smooth, minimal, and embedded everywhere except where Γ meets interior of Σ, say λ. An alternative way to see the picture is that if you push from the coincidence set λ in Σ into the convex part, you can reduce the area of Σ (like a folding curve in [\cite=MY2]), but you create a transverse self intersection in the interior. This cannot happen as Σ is minimizing area among the embedded disks. In other words, the coincidence set λ behaves like a barrier to embeddedness, even though you can reduce the area by going in that direction.

Also, one might ask whether φ is an embedding on whole int(D2) or not. This is not true in general. The reason for that the interior might have nontransverse self-intersection with itself at the coincidence set λ. For example, if Σ has more than one local sheet near the coincidence set λ, φ|int(D2) can not be an embedding. To construct such an example, one can take two "parallel" close embedded area minimizing disks Σ1 and Σ2. Then, by adding a tiny bridge β between them one can get another area minimizing disk Σ with new boundary which is close to [formula]. Now, if you make a thin and long horn from the part close to Σ1 which intersect both Σ1 and Σ2 transversely like in Figure 1, then the area minimizing disk [formula] which minimizes area for the new boundary curve is an example for such a situation. One needs to push the intersection of the horn with both Σ1 and Σ2 to the boundary, and the interiors of them will meet in the boundary. Hence, φ cannot be an embedding on int(D2) in general.

On the other hand, there is a relevant result about the same question due to Meeks-Yau [\cite=MY3]. They give a necessary condition for a sufficiently smooth simple closed curve in a 3-manifold to bound a strictly stable embedded minimal disk.

([\cite=MY3], Theorem 3) Let Γ be a C2,α simple closed curve in a 3-manifold M. Then, Γ bounds a strictly stable minimal disk Σ in M if and only if there exists a sufficiently convex codimension-0 submanifold N in M, whose topological type is a 3-ball, and Γ  ⊂  ∂N.

Hence, by combining this result with ours for C2,α smooth simple closed curves, we conclude that if Γ is a C2,α simple closed curve in a 3-manifold M, and there is no sufficiently convex domain N as in above theorem with Γ  ⊂  ∂N, then the pseudo-area minimizing disk Σ given by our main theorem is not embedded up to the boundary. In other words, if φ:D2  →  M parameterizes Σ with φ(D2)  =  Σ, φ(∂D2)  =  Γ, then [formula]. However, neither our result nor the above theorem of Meeks-Yau says anything about unstable minimal disks. It is still possible for such a simple closed curve in a 3-manifold M to bound an embedded unstable minimal disk in M.
