Enumeration of bigrassmannian permutations below a permutation in Bruhat order

Introduction

In the theory of Coxeter groups, bigrassmannian elements are known as elements which have precisely one left descent and precisely one right descent. They play a significant role to investigate structure of the Bruhat order [\cite=geck]. In particular, in the symmetric group (type A), bigrassmannian permutations have many nice order-theoretic properties. First, Lascoux-Schützenberger proved [\cite=lascoux] that a permutation is bigrassmannian if and only if it is join-irreducible. For definition of join-irreduciblity, see [\cite=reading4]. Second, Reading [\cite=reading4] characterized join-irreducible permutations as certain minimal monotone triangles. In this article, we will make use of these characterizations to answer the following question: given a permutation x, how can we find the number of bigrassmannian permutations weakly below it in Bruhat order? Unfortunately, this is not easy from the usual definition of Bruhat order. Instead, it is much easier to use monotone triangles because the set of monotone triangles has a partial order which is equivalent to Bruhat order over the symmetric groups. Moreover, there is a natural identification of join-irreducible (equivalently, bigrassmannian) permutations with entries of monotone triangles. We will see detail of these in Section 2. In Section 3, we prove the main result:

Two characterizations of bigrassmannian permutations

We begin with definition of the Bruhat order.

For x∈Sn, define left and right descents to be

[formula]

We say that x is bigrassmannian if #  DL(x) =   #  DR(x) = 1. Define

[formula]

We would like to know B(x) and β(x) for a given x. As mentioned earlier, this is not easy from the definition of Bruhat order. However, the following two equivalent characterizations of bigrassmannian permutations by Lascoux-Schützenberger and Reading are helpful.

Before Reading's characterization, let us see the definition of monotone triangles.

A monotone triangle x of order n is an n(n - 1) / 2-tuple (xab  |  1  ≤  b  ≤  a  ≤  n - 1) such that 1  ≤  xab  ≤  n,xab  <  xa,b + 1,xab  ≥  xa + 1,b and xab  ≤  xa + 1,b + 1 for all a,b. Regard a permutation x∈Sn as a monotone triangle of order n as follows: for each 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 1, let [formula] be integers such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  b  ≤  a - 1. Then x = (xab) is a monotone triangle. Denote by L(Sn) the set of all monotone triangles of order n. Define a partial order on L(Sn) by x  ≤  y if xab  ≤  yab for all a,b.

Following [\cite=reading4], we introduce an important family of monotone triangles.

For positive integers (a,b,c) such that 1  ≤  b  ≤  a  ≤  n - 1 and b + 1  ≤  c  ≤  n - a + b, define Jabc to be the componentwise smallest monotone triangle such that a,b entry is ≥  c (notice that Reading worked on Sn + 1(=   Coxeter group of type [formula]) while here we are working on Sn). In other words, Jabc satisfies x  ≥  Jabc if and only if xab  ≥  c for x∈L(Sn).

As a consequence of minimality of Jabc in Definition [\ref=mini], it is easy to compare join-irreducible monotone triangles at the same position (a,b) as

[formula]

for all c,d with b + 1  ≤  c,d  ≤  n - a + b. Hence we may identify entries appearing in (xab) with "(Jabxab)". This identification is quite useful to find β(x) (because of Characterizations 1 and 2) as we shall see in Proposition [\ref=p].

For x∈L(Sn), define

[formula]

For each a,b such that 1  ≤  b  ≤  a  ≤  n - 1, there is a chain of bigrassmannian permutaitons:

[formula]

Consequently for x∈L(Sn),

[formula]

Let x∈L(Sn). Then β(x) = Σ(x) - Σ(e).

Use [formula].

Note that eab = b for all a,b. It then follows from (1) that

[formula]

Proof of Theorem

We saw the formula of β(x) for general monotone triangles x. If x is a permutation, there are simpler formulas of β(x) because x(a) appears n - a times in entries of the monotone triangle for each a so that it is easier to compute Σ(x).

Proof. We show the first equality.

[formula]

Next we check the second equality. Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Before the proof the last equality, we need a lemma.

Let x∈Sn and i < j. Then we have

[formula]

In particular, β(x) - β(xsi) = x(i) - x(i + 1).

Proof. Let w = xtij. Note that w(i) = x(j),w(j) = x(i) and w(a) = x(a) for all a  ≠  i,j. Then apply the first equality as just shown to w and x:

[formula]

The proof is induction on [formula]. If [formula], then x = e and hence β(e) = 0. If [formula], we can choose some a such that (a,a + 1)∈I(x) (otherwise x = e since [formula]). Let w = xsa. Note that (a,a + 1)∉I(w). Now set

[formula]

Clearly [formula] and the union is disjoint. Observe that [formula] since [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  a - 1. Therefore

[formula]

It is quite similar to show that

[formula]

Since [formula], the hypothesis of induction tells us that

[formula]

Then thanks to the Lemma, we conclude that

[formula]

Let x = 42513. Then

[formula]
