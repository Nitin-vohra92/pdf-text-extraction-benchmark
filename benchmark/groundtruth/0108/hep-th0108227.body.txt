Due to their exceptional properties the superintegrable systems, both classical and quantum, are subject of constant interest. The number of examples is here, however, slightly limited. The aim of the present paper is to outline some general procedure leading to superintegrable models generalizing Winternitz system [\cite=b1] [formula] [\cite=b4]. Let us consider an integrable classical system of N degrees of freedom coupled by confining forces. According to the general theory [\cite=b5] one can then define action-angle variables Jk,φk,    k = 1,...,N; the submanifolds Jk = const are (sum of) invariant Liouville-Arnold tori TN, parametrized by the angels φk provided the identification TN  ~  (S1)N has been made. Generically, when restricted to invariant torus, the dynamics appears to be ergodic. If this is not the case the system posses an additional integral of motion which is independent of Jk's. Such a system is called superintegrable. The maximal number of these additional integrals is N - 1 and the corresponding dynamics is called maximally superintegrable. It is easy to see that all trajectories of maximally superintegrable system, being compact common intersections of 2N - 1 hypersurfaces, are closed. This is possible if and only if all ratios ωk(J) / ωj(J) of the frequencies [formula] are rational numbers.This implies

[formula]

where mk are integers and ω(J) is a fixed function of action variables. The general form of the hamiltonian leading to ([\ref=w1]) is

[formula]

The additionals integrals of motion can be now easily constructed [\cite=b6]. To this end let m  be the least common multiple of mk,  k = 1,...,N and let [formula] Then sin (lkφk - l1φ1), (or cosines),k = 2,...,N, are well-defined isolating independent integrals of motion;indeed,their time-independence is a direct consequence of eq.([\ref=w1]) while their single-valudness follows from the invariance under substitutions Moreover,they are functionally independent exept nowhere dense set of points where some of the action variables vanish.It is easy to see that ,together with the action variables,these additional integrals define trajectories so any other time-independent integral is expressible in terms of them.This can be checked explicitly in the case of most prominent examples of superintegrable systems like Kepler problem, where the additional integrals are provided by Runge-Lenz vector, or Winternitz system. As in the case of Winternitz system let us now start with completely separated hamiltonian

[formula]

which is immediately known to be integrable. However, even being so simple, H is generically not superintegrable. So one can pose the question which potentials Uk(x) lead to superintegrable dynamics, in particular-maximally superintegrable. Taking into account that H is completely separated and using eq.([\ref=w2]) we conclude that H should be of the form

[formula]

with some real constant α. This implies that all periods

[formula]

are constant, i.e. energy-independent. This result is rather obvious: consider ωk(Ek) / ω1(E1) as a function of Ek (or E1); it is continous and attains only rational values so it must be a constant. We conclude that H, given by eq.([\ref=w3]), is maximally superintegrable if and only if all Uk(x) are such that the corresponding periods of one-dimensional motions are energy-independent and their ratios are rational numbers. The solution to this problem is, however, well known [\cite=b6]. Assume that U(x) is such that (i)  0 is the absolute minimum of U(x),(ii)  U(x) = E has exactly two solutions x1,2(E)  for any E > 0. Then, given the period T(E) as a function of energy, one can find all U(x), which produce T(E), from the equation

[formula]

In our case Tk(ε) = 2π  /  αmk so Uk(x) is given by

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=w7]) gives the general solution to the problem which hamiltonians H, eq.([\ref=w3]), are maximally superintegrable. To find some particular classes of potentials Uk let us note that, due to the fact that there are exactly two solutions to Uk(x) = E one can write

[formula]

with some, yet unspecified, function φk(x).  Then Uk(x) takes the form

[formula]

The condition Uk(x) = Uk(φk(x)) will be obeyed if φk(φk(x)) = x. The choice φk(x) =  - x, resp. φk(x) = γk / x, correponds to harmonic oscillators, resp. Winternitz system. It is not difficult to find other examples. Let ηk > 0 be arbitrary real positives (of dimension of lenght) and let φk(x)

[formula]

Then [formula] and Uk(x) defined by ([\ref=w9]) obeys (i),(ii). Therefore, the hamiltonian

[formula]

with ηk < xk  <    ∞  , is maximally superintegrable. In principle, one can construct the additional integrals of motion according to the recipe formulated above. However, they are not expressible in terms of simple (elementary, elliptic...) functions. This model can be easily generalized. Take nk to be positive integer and write

[formula]

Again one checks easily that [formula] and Uk(x) obeys (i) and (ii).  Although the explicit expression for additional integrals of motion are not accessible it is not difficult to generalize the Evans result [\cite=b4] concerning the dynamical Poisson algebra for Winternitz system. It appears that for the systems defined above it is again sp(2N,R) [\cite=b7]. We have assumed above that there are exactly two solutions to the equation Uk(x) = E because for this case the problem of finding Uk(x) in terms of Tk(E) is tractable in a simple way.However,this assumption seems to be also important on its own because we need Tk to be energy- independent.For the energies E close to the local minimum the frequency squared of the motion equals second derivative of the potential at the minimum. On the other hand,if U(x) = E has more solutions there must be also local maximum of U(x) and for the energy equal to the value of U(x) at such a maximum the period becames infinite.In other words,the period can not be energy-independent. The algorithm outlined above allows to produce many superintegrable systems of arbitrary number of degrees of freedom. It allows also in principle to construct the additional integrals of motion; one has to find the angle variables and to construct the appropriate single-valued functions of them. It is also worth to note that eq.([\ref=w6]) allows to construct the models which are superintegrable in some region of phase space only. To this end we select for any k the energy intervals Ek,Ek  +  Δk and assume that [formula] are constant over intervals and Tk / Tl are rational. Eq.([\ref=w6]) allow us then to find the relevant potentials. The resulting hamiltonian is superintegrable in the above specified region of phase space.
