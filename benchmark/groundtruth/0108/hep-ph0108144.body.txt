Charge Asymmetry and Photon Energy Spectrum in the Decay Bs  →  l+l-γ

Introduction

The rare decay Bs  →  l+l-γ is of interest as a probe of the effective Hamiltonian for the transition bs̄  →  l+l-, and as a testing ground for form factors describing the matrix elements [formula] and [formula] [\cite=aliev] [\cite=geng]. The branching ratio for Bs  →  l+l-γ can be sizeable in comparison to the non-radiative process Bs  →  l+l-, since the chiral suppression of the latter is absent in the radiative transition. We will be concerned mainly with the structure-dependent part of the matrix element, since the correction due to bremsstrahlung from the external leptons is small and can be removed by eliminating the end-point region sl+l-  ≈  M2Bs. (For related studies of radiative B decays, we refer to the papers in Ref. [\cite=eilam].)

Our objective is to calculate the decay spectrum of Bs  →  l+l-γ using form factors suggested by recent work in QCD [\cite=kor]. These form factors have the virtue of possessing a universal behaviour 1 / Eγ for large Eγ, as well as a universal normalization. These features can be tested in measurements of B+  →  μ+νγ and Bs  →  γγ. We derive simple formulae for the photon energy spectrum dΓ / dxγ, xγ  =  2Eγ / mBs, and the charge asymmetry A(xγ), defined as the difference in the probability of events with E+  >  E- and E+  <  E-, E± being the l± energies. This asymmetry is large over most of the xγ domain. Predictions are obtained for the branching ratios Br(Bs  →  e+e-γ) and Br(Bs  →  μ+μ-γ) which are somewhat higher than those estimated in previous literature [\cite=aliev] [\cite=geng].

Matrix Element and Differential Decay Rate

The effective Hamiltonian for the interaction bs̄  →  l+l- has the standard form [\cite=buch]

[formula]

where PL,R  =  (1  ∓  γ5) / 2 and q is the sum of the l+ and l- momenta. For the purpose of this paper, we will neglect the small q2  -  dependent terms in Ceff9, arising from one-loop contributions of four-quark operators, as well as long-distance effects associated with c resonances. The Wilson coefficients in Eq.([\ref=effechamil]) will be taken to have the constant values

[formula]

To obtain the amplitude for Bs  →  l+l-γ, one requires the matrix elements [formula] and [formula]. We parametrise these in the same way as in Ref. [\cite=aliev] [\cite=geng]

[formula]

The form factors fV,fA,fT and [formula] are dimensionless, and related to those of Aliev et al [\cite=aliev] by [formula]. The matrix element for s  →  l+l-γ can then be written as (neglecting terms of order ms / mb)

[formula]

where

[formula]

(In the coefficient of C7, we have approximated mbMBs by M2Bs). The Dalitz plot density in the energy variables E± is

[formula]

where [\cite=aliev] [\cite=geng] [\cite=xiong]

[formula]

It is convenient to introduce dimensionless variables

[formula]

in terms of which q2  =  M2Bs(1 - xγ). Taking xγ and Δ as the two coordinates of the Dalitz plot, phase space is defined by

[formula]

In terms of xγ and Δ, the differential decay width takes the form

[formula]

where [formula]. The last term is linear in Δ and produces an asymmetry between the l+ and l- energy spectra.

We will derive from Eq. ([\ref=diffdecaywidth]) two distributions of interest: (i) The charge asymmetry A(xγ) defined as

[formula]

(ii) The photon energy spectrum

[formula]

To proceed further, we must introduce a model for the form factors which appear in the functions A1,2 and B1,2 defined in Eq. ([\ref=a1etc]).

Model for Form Factors

First of all, we note that the form factors fT and [formula] defined in Eq. ([\ref=matrixelement]) are necessarily equal, by virtue of the identity

[formula]

This was pointed out by Korchemsky et al [\cite=kor]. We therefore have to deal with three independent form factors fV,fA and fT. These have been computed in Ref. [\cite=kor] using perturbative QCD methods combined with heavy quark effective theory. For the vector and axial vector form factors of the radiative decay B+  →  l+νγ, and their tensor counterpart, defined as in Eq. ([\ref=matrixelement]), these authors obtain the remarkable result

[formula]

where R is a parameter related to the light-cone wave-function of the B meson, with an order of magnitude R- 1  ~  Λ̄  =  MB  -  mb, where the binding energy Λ̄ is estimated to be between 0.3 and 0.4 GeV. Applying the same reasoning to the form factors for s  →  l+l-γ, we conclude that

[formula]

In what follows, we will neglect the term Qb / mb, and approximate the form factors by

[formula]

where Λ̄s  =  MBs  -  mb will be taken to have the nominal value 0.5 GeV. Several of our results will depend only on the universal form fV,A,T(Eγ)  ~  1 / Eγ, independent of the normalization. As pointed out in [\cite=kor], a check of the behaviour fV,A  ~  1 / Eγ in the case of B+  →  μ+νγ is afforded by the photon energy spectrum, which is predicted to be

[formula]

In the case of the reaction Bs  →  l+l-γ, the normalization of the tensor form factor fT(Eγ) at Eγ  =  MB / 2  (i.e.  xγ = 1) can be checked by appeal to the decay rate of Bs  →  γγ. To see this connection, we note that the matrix element of [formula] can be obtained from that of Bs  →  l+l-γ by putting C9  =  C10 = 0, and replacing the factor [formula] by [formula]. This yields the matrix element

[formula]

The result for A± coincides with that obtained in Refs. [\cite=chang] [\cite=reina] [\cite=herrlich] when [formula]. ( In Ref. [\cite=reina] [\cite=herrlich], the role of the parameter Λs is played by the constituent quark mass ms. ) Thus the decay width of Bs  →  γγ,

[formula]

serves as a test of the normalization factor fT(xγ  =  1).

We remark, parenthetically, that the calculation of Bs  →  γγ, based on an effective interaction for b  →  sγγ, produces the amplitudes A+ and A- given in Eq. ([\ref=matrixelement2]) in the limit of retaining only the 'reducible' diagrams related to the transition b  →  sγ. Inclusion of 'irreducible' contributions like bs̄  →  c  →  γγ introduces a correction term in A- causing the ratio |A+ / A-| to deviate from unity. Estimates in Ref. [\cite=chang] [\cite=reina] yield values for this ratio between 0.75 and 0.9. The branching ratio Br(Bs  →  γγ) is estimated at 5  ×  10- 7, with an uncertainty of about 50%.

Having specified our model for the form factors fV(xγ),fA(xγ) and fT(xγ), we proceed to present results for the spectrum and branching ratio of Bs  →  l+l-γ. We use MBs  =  5.3  GeV,fBs  =  200  MeV and, where necessary, Λ̄s  =  0.5  GeV in the normalization of the form factors in Eq. ([\ref=formfactors]).

Results

Charge Asymmetry

With the assumption of universal form factors [formula], the asymmetry A(xγ) in Eq. ([\ref=asymmetry]) assumes the simple form

[formula]

This is plotted in Fig.[\ref=plot1], and is clearly large and negative over most of the xγ domain, changing sign at [formula]. (A negative asymmetry corresponds to l- being more energetic, on average, than l+ in the decay s(  =  bs̄)  →  l+l-γ.) The average charge asymmetry is

[formula]

and has the numerical value [formula] , [formula] for the modes l = e,μ, the difference arising essentially from the end-point region xγ  ≈  1 - 4  r.

Photon Energy Spectrum

With the form factors of Eq. ([\ref=formfactors]), the photon energy spectrum simplifies to

[formula]

where the constant factor N is defined after Eq. ([\ref=diffdecaywidth]). It is expedient to write this distribution in terms of the decay rate of s  →  γγ. We then obtain the prediction

[formula]

The first factor (in curly brackets { }) is the QED result expected if the decay s  →  l+l-γ is interpreted as a Dalitz pair reaction [formula], without form factors. The factor (1 / xγ)2 results from the universal behaviour fV,A,T  ~  1 / xγ given in Eq. ([\ref=diffdecaywidth]), while the last factor is the electroweak effect associated with the coefficients η9  =  C9 / (2C7) and η10  =  C10 / (2C7). This distribution is plotted in Figs. [\ref=plot2] and [\ref=plot4], where the QED result is shown for comparison.

Rates and Branching Ratios

From the photon spectrum given in Eq. ([\ref=photonspectrum]), we derive the 'conversion ratios'

[formula]

The numerical values are [formula]. These are to be contrasted with the QED result given by

[formula]

which yields Re(QED) = 2.3%, Rμ(QED)  =  0.67%. The absolute branching ratios of s  →  l+l-γ, obtained by taking Br(Bs  →  γγ)  =  5  ×  10- 7 [\cite=chang] [\cite=reina] are Br(s  →  e+e-γ)  =  2.0  ×  10- 8, Br(s  →  μ+μ-γ)  =  1.2  ×  10- 8. Our results for the average charge asymmetry [formula], the conversion ratios Rl and the branching ratios are summarized in Table [\ref=table].

Comments

(i) The branching ratios calculated by us are somewhat higher than those obtained in previous work [\cite=aliev] [\cite=geng], which used a different parametrization of the form factors [formula] based on QCD sum rules [\cite=aliev] and light-front models [\cite=geng]. In particular these parametrizations do not satisfy the relation [formula] which, as noted in [\cite=kor], follows from the identity [formula].

(ii) Our predictions for the charge asymmetry [formula] and the conversion ratio Γ(s  →  l+l-γ)  /  Γ(s  →  γγ) are independent of the parameter Λ̄s which appears in the form factor in Eq. ([\ref=formfactors]). The branching ratios in Table [\ref=table] assume Br(s  →  γγ)  =  5  ×  10- 7, and can be rescaled when data on this channel are available.

(iii) A full analysis of the decay s  →  l+l-γ requires inclusion of the bremsstrahlung amplitude corresponding to photon emission from the leptons in Bs  →  l+l-. This contribution is proportional to fBsml and affects the photon energy spectrum in the small xγ region. We have calculated the corrected spectrum for Bs  →  l+l-γ, following the procedure in [\cite=aliev2], and the result is shown in Fig. [\ref=plot6] for the case l  =  μ. As anticipated, the correction is limited to small xγ, and can be removed by a cut at small photon energies.

(iv) The QCD form factors in Eq. ([\ref=formfactors]) are valid up to corrections of order (ΛQCD / Eγ)2. In the small xγ region, arguments based on heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory suggest form factors dominated by the [formula] pole with the appropriate quantum numbers, for example,

[formula]

Defining [formula], this form factor has the behaviour [formula], with δ  ≈  2ΔM  /  MBs  ≈  0.02. We have investigated the effect of replacing the QCD form factor of Eq. ([\ref=formfactors]) by a different universal form fV,A,T(xγ)  =  fBs  /  (3Λ̄s(xγ  +  δ)), and found only minor changes in the numbers given in Table [\ref=table]. In general, one must expect some distortion in the spectrum at low xγ, compared to that shown in Figs. [\ref=plot1]-[\ref=plot6].

(v) We will examine separately the predictions for A(xγ) and dΓ / dxγ in the reaction Bs  →  τ+τ-γ, in which the bremsstrahlung part of the matrix element plays a significant role [\cite=aliev2]. We will consider also refinements due to the q2  -  dependent term in Ceff9, and the effects of c resonances.

In view of their clear signature, non-negligible branching ratios and interesting dynamics, the decays Bs  →  l+l-γ could form an attractive domain of study at future hadron colliders.
