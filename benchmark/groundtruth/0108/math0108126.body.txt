Keywords. Cyclic homology, Hopf algebras .

Introduction

Getzler and Jones in [\cite=gj93] introduced a method to compute the cyclic homology of a crossed product algebra [formula], where G is a group that acts on an algebra A by automorphisms. This method is based on constructing a cylindrical module, [formula], and showing that [formula], where Δ is the diagonal and [formula] the cyclic module functor. Then by using the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem for cylindrical modules, they obtained a quasi-isomorphism of mixed complexes [formula], and a spectral sequence converging to [formula]. This spectral sequence was first obtained, by a different method, by Feigin and Tsygan [\cite=fs86]. We used the the same method in [\cite=rm01] [\cite=rm02] to generalize their work to Hopf module algebras and Hopf comodule coalgebras where the antipode of H is assumed to be bijective. In this paper we treat the two remaining cases, i.e., we derive spectral sequences that converge to the cyclic (co)homology of the crossed product (co)algebra associated to a Hopf comodule algebra or to a Hopf module coalgebra. The formulas in [\cite=rm01], [\cite=rm02] and the present paper cannot be deduced from each other and in each case it required a lot of effort to discover them.

In this paper we work over a fixed commutative ground ring k. By algebra we mean a unital associative k-algebra and algebra homomorphisms are unit preserving. Similar conventions apply to coalgebras and Hopf algebras. The unadorned tensor product [formula] means tensor product over k.

We denote the comultiplication of a coalgebra by Δ, its counit by ε and the antipode of a Hopf algebra by S. We use Sweedler's notation and write [formula], etc., where summation is understood. We assume the antipodes of our Hopf algebras are bijective. While this assumption may not be crucial for our definition of crossed product algebras and coalgebras, it plays an important role in our construction of cylindrical modules in Sections 2 and 3.

If H is a Hopf algebra, by an H-module we mean a module over the underlying algebra of H and by an H-comodule we mean a comodule over the underlying coalgebra of H. We use Sweedler's notation for comodules. Thus if [formula] is the structure map of a left H-comodule M, we write [formula], where summation is understood.

We say that an algebra A is a left H-comodule algebra if it is a left H-comodule and the coaction [formula] is an algebra map. So, we have, for all a,b in A,

[formula]

Given a left H-comodule algebra A, we define the crossed product algebra [formula], to be the k-module [formula] with the following product

[formula]

It is easy to check that this is an associative product with [formula] as its unit.

Let C be a coalgebra and H a Hopf algebra. We say that C is a left [formula]-module coalgebra if C is a left H-module and

[formula]

This says that the module map [formula] is a coalgebra map, where [formula] has the tensor product coalgebra structure.

If C is an H-module coalgebra, we define the crossed product coalgebra [formula], to be the k-module [formula] with the following coproduct

[formula]

One can check that this is a coassociative coproduct with counit [formula]. In fact,

[formula]

and,

[formula]

We assume the reader is familiar with notions of cyclic homology theory, in particular with (co)cyclic modules, para(co)cyclic modules and (co)cylindrical modules. They can all be found in [\cite=rm01] [\cite=rm02] [\cite=gj93] [\cite=ll92]. We recall the definition of the cocyclic module [formula] associated to a coalgebra C. We have [formula] with coface, codegeneracy and cyclic maps defined by

[formula]

The Cylindrical Module [formula]

In this section we introduce the cylindrical module

[formula]

where A is an H-comodule algebra and H is a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode. We define the operators τp,q,∂p,q,σp,q and p,q,p,q,p,q as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] and h  ·  g  =  h(0)gS(h(1)) is the conjugation action of H on itself.

[formula]

[formula] with the operators defined in ([\ref=eq:opcy1]),([\ref=eq:opcy2]) is a cylindrical module.

We check only the commutativity of the cyclic operators and the cylindrical condition.

τp,qp,q  =  p,qτp,q

[formula]

[formula]

(p,q)p + 1  (τp,q)q + 1 = (τp,q)q + 1  (p,q)p + 1 = idp,q

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the diagonal of [formula] Since [formula] is cylindrical, we have:

[formula] is a cyclic module.

Let [formula] denote the cyclic module of the crossed product algebra [formula].

We have an isomorphism of cyclic modules

[formula]

One can check that φ and ψ define isomorphisms, inverse to each other, between [formula] and [formula] where,

[formula]

[formula]

We define an action of H on the first column of [formula] by

[formula]

where ·   is the conjugation action of H on itself. We define [formula] as the coinvariant space of [formula] under the above action, so that

[formula]

In order to compute the [formula] and [formula] term of the spectral sequence associated to [formula], we replace [formula] by another cylindrical module.

Let [formula] and [formula] We replace the cylindrical module [formula] with a new cylindrical module [formula], via isomorphisms defined by the maps [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

It can be shown that [formula]. We find the operators, [formula] under this isomorphism.

[formula] First we compute   =  βγ. Since

[formula]

we see that,

[formula]

[formula]

Here the boundary δ is the Hopf-module boundary defined by

[formula]

where m∈M and M is an H-module. We also conclude that

[formula]

[formula] For [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula] Next we compute the operator [formula]. We have

[formula]

[formula]

So we conclude that for 0  ≤  i  <  q,

[formula]

[formula] We consider [formula] and [formula]. We have

[formula]

By the above computations we can state the following theorems.

The complex [formula] is isomorphic to the complex [formula] where [formula] is the Hopf-module boundary. ([formula] is defined in [\cite=gj93]).

For p  ≥  0, [formula], with the operators defined as follows, are cyclic modules:

[formula]

We check this only for p = 0. The general case is similar. The operators are well defined on the coinvariant space. For example for [formula] since [formula] and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

So [formula] is well defined on the coinvariant space.

To show that [formula] one can check that in the coinvariant space

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] with the following operators is a cyclic module.

[formula]

Now we use the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem for cylindrical modules, combined with Theorem [\ref=iso1] to conclude

[formula]

To compute the homology of the mixed complex [formula] we filter it by the subspaces

[formula]

If we separate the operator [formula] as [formula], from Theorems ([\ref=th:iso1]) and ([\ref=th:iso2]) we can deduce the following theorem for the spectral sequence associated to [formula].

There exists an spectral sequence that converges to [formula]. The [formula]-term of this spectral sequence is isomorphic to the complex

[formula]

and the [formula]-term is

[formula]

The [formula]-term of the spectral sequence is

[formula]

the cyclic homology of the cyclic module [formula] with coefficients in [formula]

We give an application of the above spectral sequence. Let k be a field. Recall that a Hopf algebra H over k is called semisimple if it is semisimple as an algebra. It is shown in [\cite=sw69] that H is semisimple if and only if there is a right integral t∈H with ε(t) = 1. Recall that a right integral in H is an element t∈H such that for all h∈H,th = ε(h)t. Now, it is easy to see that if H is semisimple, for any left H-module M, we have H0(H,M) = MH and Hi(H,M) = 0 for i > 0. In fact, we have the following homotopy operator [formula]

[formula]

One can check that δh  +  hδ  =  id. Note that semisimple Hopf algebras have bijective antipodes.

Let H be a semisimple Hopf algebra. Then there is a natural isomorphism of cyclic homology groups

[formula]

where [formula] is the cyclic module of equivariant chains.

Since H is semisimple, we have [formula] for q > 0 and the spectral sequence collapses. The first row of [formula] is exactly [formula]

The Cocylindrical Module [formula]

Let H be a Hopf algebra with a bijective antipode and C a left H-module coalgebra. Our aim in this section is to establish a spectral sequence for computing the cyclic cohomology of the crossed product coalgebra [formula] To this end, we introduce the cocylindrical module

[formula]

We define the vertical and horizontal operators τp,q,∂p,q,σp,q and p,q,p,q,p,q as follows:

[formula]

where g  ·  a denotes the action of g∈H on a∈C,

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the diagonal action of H on [formula].

The proof of the following theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.1 and we omit it.

Endowed with the operators defined in ([\ref=eq:opcy5]),([\ref=eq:opcy6]), [formula] is a cocylindrical module.

[formula] is a cocyclic module.

We have an isomorphism of cocyclic modules

[formula]

One can check that φ and ψ define isomorphisms, inverse to each other, between [formula] and [formula] where,

[formula]

and

[formula]

We define a left H-coaction on the first column of [formula], [formula] = [formula], by

[formula]

We define [formula] and [formula] So we can construct [formula], the cohomology of the coalgebra H with coefficients in the comodule [formula] We define [formula] as the coinvariant space of [formula] under the above coaction, so that [formula] is the space of all [formula] such that

[formula]

Now we replace the cocylindrical module [formula] with an isomorphic cocylindrical module [formula], under the isomorphism defined by the maps [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

One can check that [formula]. We find the operators [formula] under this transformation. Since the computations are similar to the comodule algebra case, we only give the final results.

[formula] For [formula], we have

[formula]

Here [formula] is the Hopf-comodule coboundary defined by

[formula]

where m∈M and M is a left H-comodule with structure map [formula]. So we have,

[formula]

[formula] For [formula] we have,

[formula]

For [formula]     0  ≤  i  <  p,   we have

[formula]

[formula] Next we compute the operator [formula]. We have

[formula]

So we conclude that,

[formula]

[formula] We consider [formula] and [formula]. We have

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

By the above computations we can state the following theorems.

The complex [formula] is isomorpaic to the complex [formula] where [formula] is the Hopf-comodule coboundary.

For p  ≥  0, [formula], with the operators defined as follows, are cocyclic modules:

[formula]

We prove this for p = 0, the general case being similar. We have [formula] The operators are well defined on the coinvariant space. For example for [formula] since [formula] and [formula] if [formula] then [formula] .

To show that [formula] we see that in the coinvariant space we have,

[formula]

So we have,

[formula]

where,

[formula]

and,

[formula]

Therefore in the coinvariant space we have

[formula]

and now it is easy to check that [formula].

We use again the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem for cocylindrical modules combined with Theorem [\ref=iso2] to conclude

[formula]

To compute the cohomology of the mixed complex [formula] we filter it by the subspaces

[formula]

If again we separate the operator [formula] as [formula], from Theorems ([\ref=th:iso1]),([\ref=th:iso2]) we can deduce the following theorem.

There is an spectral sequence that converges to [formula]. The [formula]-term of this spectral sequence is isomorphic to the complex

[formula]

and the [formula]-term is

[formula]

The [formula]-term of the spectral sequence is

[formula]

the cyclic cohomology of the cyclic comodules [formula] with coefficients in [formula]

We give an application of the above spectral sequence. Let k be a field. Recall that a Hopf algebra H over k is called cosemisimple if H is cosemisimple as a coalgebra, that is, every left H-comodule is completely reducible [\cite=sw69]. One knows that a Hopf algebra is cosemisimple if and only if there exists a left integral x∈ with x(1) = 1 ([\cite=sw69], Theorem 14.0.3). It is easy to see that if H is cosemisimple and M is an H-bicomodule, then the coalgebra (Hochschild) cohomology groups satisfy Hi(H,M) = 0 for i  >  0, and H0(H,M) = McoH, the subspace of coinvariants of the bicomodule M. In fact, we have the following homotopy operator [formula]

[formula]

One can check theat δh  +  hδ = id. Note that the antipode of H is bijective if H is cosemisimple.

Let H be a cosemisimple Hopf algebra. Then there is a natural isomorphism of cyclic and Hochschild cohomology groups

[formula]

[formula]

Since H is cosemisimple, we have [formula] for p  >  0 and the spectral sequence collapses. The first column of [formula] is exactly [formula].
