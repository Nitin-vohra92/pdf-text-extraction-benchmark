The Hilbert transform, rearrangements, and logarithmic determinants

,  Iossif Ostrovskii,  and Mikhail Sodin[formula]

This is an extended version of notes prepared for the talk at the conference "Rajchman-Zygmund-Marcinkiewicz 2000". They are based on recent papers [\cite=MOS] and [\cite=MS2] (see also [\cite=MS1] and [\cite=MS3]). The authors thank Professor Zelazko for the invitation to participate in the proceedings of this conference.

§ 1

Let g be a bounded measurable real-valued function on [formula] with a compact support.

We shall use the following notations:

The Hilbert transform of g:

[formula]

the prime means that the integral is understood in the principal value sense at the point t = ξ.

The (signed) distribution function of g:

[formula]

The (signed) decreasing rearrangement of g: gd is defined as the distribution function of Ng: gd  =  NNg.

Less formally, the functions Ng and gd can be also defined by the following properties: they are non-negative and non-increasing for s > 0, non-positive and non-increasing for s < 0, and

[formula]

for any function Φ such that at least one of the three integrals is absolutely convergent.

We shall use notation [formula], when A  ≤  C  ·  B for a positive numerical constant C. We shall write [formula], if C in the previous inequality depends on the parameter λ only.

Theorem 1.1 Let g be a bounded measurable real-valued function with a compact support. Then

[formula]

Hereafter, L1 always means [formula].

Remarks:

1.3 Estimate (1.2) can be extended to a wider class of functions after an additional regularization of the Hilbert transform Hgd (see [formula] below).

1.4 Probably, the constant 4 on the RHS is not sharp. However, Davis' discussion in [\cite=Davis] suggests that (1.2) ceases to hold without this factor on the RHS.

1.5 Theorem 1.1 yields a result of Tsereteli [\cite=Tse] and Davis [\cite=Davis]: if g∈H1, then gd is also in H1, and [formula], where H1 is the real Hardy space on [formula].

1.6 Theorem 1.1 can be extended to functions defined on the unit circle [formula]. Let g(t) be a bounded function on [formula], gd be its signed decreasing rearrangement, and [formula] be a function conjugate to g:

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Juxtapose this estimate with Baernstein's inequality [\cite=Ba]:

[formula]

where gs is the symmetric decreasing rearrangement of g. In particular, if gs has a conjugate in L1, then any rearrangement of g has a conjugate in L1, and if some rearrangement of g has a conjugate in L1, then the conjugate of gd is in L1. We are not aware of a counterpart of Baernstein's inequality for the Hilbert transform and the [formula]-norm.

§ 2

Here, we shall prove Theorem 1.1. WLOG, we assume that

[formula]

otherwise

[formula]

and the L1-norm on the RHS of (1.2) is infinite.

The first reduction: instead of (1.2), we shall prove inequality

[formula]

then its iteration gives (1.2).

We introduce a (regularized) logarithmic determinant of g:

[formula]

This function is subharmonic in [formula] and harmonic outside of [formula].

List of properties of ug:

Since g is a bounded function with a compact support,

[formula]

and by (2.1)

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Next,

[formula]

This follows from the Poisson representation:

[formula]

Dividing by y, letting y  →  0, and using (2.3a), we get (2.4).

Further,

[formula]

Indeed, integrating by parts and changing variables, we obtain for real x's:

[formula]

We have done the second reduction: Instead of (2.2), we shall prove inequality

[formula]

Then combining (2.4) and (2.6), we get (2.2).

Now, we set

[formula]

This function has an analytic continuation into the upper half-plane:

[formula]

We define the regularized logarithmic determinant of f by the equation

[formula]

The positivity of this subharmonic function is central in our argument:

Lemma 2.8 (cf. [\cite=Essen])

[formula]

Proof of Lemma 2.8: It suffices to consider such z's that all solutions of the equation zf(w) = 1 are simple and not real. Then

[formula]

The application of the Cauchy theorem is justified since f(ζ) = O(1 / ζ2) when ζ  →    ∞  , (ζ)  ≥  0. Done.

To complete the proof of the theorem, we shall use an argument borrowed from the perturbation theory of compact operators [\cite=GK]. We use auxiliary functions f1 = g + i|Hg| and

[formula]

Then on the real axis

[formula]

so that ug(x)  ≥  u1(x), or u-g(x)  ≤  u-1(x)  =   - u1(x), since u1(x)  ≤  0, [formula].

Next, we need an elementary inequality: if w1, w2 are complex numbers such that (w1)  =  (w2) and |(w1)|  ≤  (w2), then for all z in the upper half-plane,

[formula]

Due to this inequality the function u1 is non-positive in the upper half-plane. Since this function is harmonic in the upper half-plane, we obtain

[formula]

This proves (2.6) and therefore the theorem. [formula]

§ 3

Here, we will formulate a fairly complete version of estimate (2.2). The proof given in [\cite=MS2] follows similar lines as above, however is essentially more technical.

Now, we start with a real-valued measure dη of finite variation on [formula], and denote by g = Hη its Hilbert transform. By ||η|| we denote the total variation of the measure dη on [formula]. Let Rg  =  H- 1Ng be a regularized inverse Hilbert transform of Ng:

[formula]

The integral converges at infinity due to the Kolmogorov weak L1-type estimate

[formula]

Existence of the limit when ε  →  0 (and t  ≠  0) follows from the Titchmarsh formula [\cite=T] (cf. [\cite=MS2]):

[formula]

Theorem 3.1 Let dη be a real measure supported by [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Corollary 3.5 The function Rg always belongs to L1 and its L1-norm does not exceed 2||η||.

The classical Boole theorem says that if dη is non-negative and pure singular, then [formula], and therefore Rg vanishes identically. The next two corollaries can be viewed as quantitative generalizations of this fact:

Corollary 3.6 If dη  ≥  0, then Rg(t) is non-negative as well, and [formula].

Corollary 3.7 If dη is pure singular, then Rg(t) is non-positive and [formula].

For other recent results obtained with the help of the logarithmic determinant we refer to [\cite=Klemes], [\cite=MS1] and [\cite=MS3].

§ 4

In § 2 we used the subharmonic function technique for proving a theorem about the Hilbert transform. The idea of logarithmic determinants also provides us with a connection which works in the opposite direction: starting with a known result about the Hilbert transform, one arrives at a plausible conjecture about a non-negative subharmonic function in [formula] represented by a canonical integral of genus one. For illustration, we consider a well known inequality

[formula]

where f = g + iHg, g is a test function on [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Inequality (4.1) contains as special cases Kolmogorov's weak L1-type inequality [formula], and M. Riesz' inequality [formula], 1 < p  ≤  2. Inequality (4.1) can be justly attributed to Marcinkiewicz. He formulated his general interpolation theorem for sub-linear operators in [\cite=M], the proof was supplied by Zygmund in [\cite=Z] with reference to Marcinkiewicz' letter. Its main ingredient is a decomposition g = gχ{|g| < λ}  +  gχ{|g|  ≥  λ}, where χE is a characteristic function of a set E. This decomposition immediately proves (4.1), see [\cite=Koosis].

Define a logarithmic determinant uf of genus one as in (2.7), and denote by dμf its Riesz measure (i.e. 1 / (2π) times the distributional Laplacian Δuf). For each Borelian subset [formula], [formula], where E*  =  {z:  z- 1∈E}, and f- 1E* is the full preimage of E under f. Now, we can express the RHS and the LHS of inequality (4.1) in the terms of μf. First, observe that the counting function of μf equals

[formula]

In order to write down mg in terms of μf, we introduce the Levin-Tsuji counting function (cf. [\cite=Tsuji], [\cite=GO]):

[formula]

Now, we can rewrite (4.1) in the form:

[formula]

We shall show that (4.2) persists for any non-negative in [formula] subharmonic function represented by a canonical integral of genus one. In this case the operator g  ↦  Hg disappears, and the Marcinkiewicz argument seems to be unapplicable anymore.

Let

[formula]

where dμ is a non-negative locally finite measure on [formula] such that

[formula]

Subharmonic functions represented in this form are called canonical integrals of genus one.

Let M(r,u) =  max |z|  ≤  ru(z). A standard estimate of the kernel

[formula]

yields Borel's estimate (cf. [\cite=GO])

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Theorem 4.5 Let u(z)  ≥  0 be a canonical integral (4.3) of genus one, then

[formula]

The RHS of (4.6) does not depend on the bound for the integral (4.4), this makes the result not so obvious. By Jensen's formula, μ(r)  ≤  M(er,u), so that [formula]. As a corollary we immediately obtain (4.2) and the Marcinkiewicz estimate (4.1).

§ 5

Here we sketch the proof of Theorem 4.5.

We shall need two auxiliary lemmas. The first one is a version of the Levin integral formula without remainder term (cf. [\cite=Levin1], [\cite=GO]). The proof can be found in [\cite=MOS]

Lemma 5.1 Let v be a subharmonic function in [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula] is the Levin-Tsuji counting function, and the integral on the LHS is absolutely convergent.

The next lemma was proved in a slightly different setting in [\cite=LO], see also [\cite=GO]

Lemma 5.5 Let v(z) be a subharmonic function in [formula] satisfying conditions (5.2) and (5.3) of the previous lemma, let

[formula]

be its Nevanlinna characteristic function, and let

[formula]

be its Tsuji characteristic function. Then

[formula]

For the reader's convenience, we recall the proof. Consider the integral

[formula]

where ΩR  =  {z = reiθ:  r > R| sin θ|}  =  {z:|z  ±  iR / 2| > R / 2}. Introducing a new variable ρ = r / | sin θ| instead of r, we get

[formula]

Now, consider another integral

[formula]

where KR  =  {z:|z| > R}. Since KR  ⊂  ΩR, we have J(R)  ≤  I(R). Taking into account that

[formula]

we obtain (5.6). [formula]

Proof of Theorem 4.5: Due to Borel's estimate condition (5.2) is fulfilled. Due to non-negativity of u and (4.4), condition (5.3) holds as well. Using monotonicity of T(r,u), Lemma 5.5, and then Lemma 5.1, we obtain

[formula]

The inequality M(r,u)  ≤  3T(2r,u) completes the job. [formula]

§ 6

Non-negativity of u(z) in [formula] seems to be too strong assumption, a more natural one is non-negativity of u(x) on [formula].

Theorem 6.1 Let u(z) be a canonical integral (4.3) of genus one, and let u(x)  ≥  0, [formula]. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

The proof of Theorem 6.1 is given in [\cite=MOS]. The method of proof differs from that of Theorem 4.5, and is more technical than one would wish.

Fix an arbitrary ε > 0. Then by the Cauchy inequality

[formula]

Thus we get

Corollary 6.4 For each ε > 0,

[formula]

Estimate (6.5) is slightly weaker than (4.6); however, it suffices for deriving inequalities of M. Riesz and Kolmogorov. Using Jensen's estimate μ(r)  ≤  M(er,u), we arrive at

Corollary 6.6 The following inequalities hold for canonical integrals of genus one which are non-negative on the real axis:

M. Riesz-type estimate:

[formula]

weak (p,  ∞  )-type estimate:

[formula]

and Kolmogorov-type estimate:

[formula]

Remark 6.10 If the integral on the RHS of (6.9) is finite, then u(z) has positive harmonic majorants in the upper and lower half-planes which can be efficiently estimated near the origin and infinity, see [\cite=MOS].

§ 7

Here we mention several questions related to our results.

7.1 How to distinguish the logarithmic determinants (2.7) of f = g + iHg from other canonical integrals (4.3) which are non-negative in [formula]? In other words, let dmf be a distribution measure of f; i.e. a locally-finite non-negative measure in [formula] defined by [formula] for an arbitrary borelian subset [formula]. It should to be interesting to find properties of dmf which do not follow only from non-negativity of the subharmonic function uf(z). A similar question can be addressed to analytic functions f(z) of Smirnov's class in the unit disk.

7.2 Let X be a rearrangement invariant Banach space of measurable functions on [formula]. That is, the norm in X is the same for all rearrangements of |g|, and ||g1||X  ≤  ||g2||X provided that |g1|  ≤  |g2| everywhere. For which spaces does the inequality

[formula]

hold? This question is interesting only for spaces X where the Hilbert transform is unbounded; i.e. for spaces which are close in a certain sense either to L1 or to L∞. Some natural restrictions on X can be assumed: the linear span of the characteristic functions χE of bounded measurable subsets E is dense in X, and ||χE||X  →  0, when (E)  →  0, see [\cite=BS].

7.3 We do not know how to extend estimate (1.2) (as well as (1.8)) to more general operators like the maximal Hilbert transform, the non-tangential maximal conjugate harmonic function, or Calderon-Zygmund operators. A similar question can be naturally posed for the Riesz transform [\cite=Stein].

7.4 Does Marcinkiewicz-type inequality (4.6) hold under the assumption that a canonical integral u of genus one is non-negative on [formula]? According to a personal communication from A. Ph. Grishin, the exponent 3 + ε can be improved in (6.5). However, his technique also does not allow to get rid at all of the logarithmic factor.

7.5 Let u(z) be a non-negative subharmonic function in [formula], u(0) = 0. As before, by μ(r) and [formula] we denote the conventional and the Levin-Tsuji counting functions of the Riesz measure dμ of u. Assume that μ(r)  =  o(r), r  →  0. This condition is needed to exclude from consideration the function [formula] which is non-negative in [formula] and harmonic outside of [formula]. Let M, M(0) = 0, M(  ∞  )  =    ∞  , be a (regularly growing) majorant for [formula]. What can be said about the majorant for μ(r)? If M(r)  =  rp, 1 < p <   ∞  , then we know the answer:

[formula]

and

[formula]

It is more difficult and interesting to study majorants M(r) which grow faster than any power of r when r  →    ∞  , and decay to zero faster than any power of r when r  →  0. The question might be related to the classical Carleman-Levinson-Sjoberg "log  log -theorem", and the progress may lead to new results about the Hilbert transform.
