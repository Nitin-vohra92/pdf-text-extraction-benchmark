2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 06B10, 08A30 According to Chajda and Eigenthaler ([\cite=ce]), a d-lattice is a bounded lattice L satisfying for all a,c∈L the implications

where θ(x,y) denotes the least congruence on L containing the pair (x,y). Every bounded distributive lattice is a d-lattice. The 5-element nonmodular lattice N5 is a d-lattice.

A bounded lattice is a d-lattice if and only if all maximal ideals and maximal filters are prime.

Let I be a maximal ideal in a d-lattice L. Let [formula]. We need to show that [formula]. Since I is maximal, there are c1,c2∈I such that [formula]. For [formula] we have [formula]. Then [formula] and similarly (y,1)∈θ(0,c), hence [formula]. By (i) we have [formula], hence [formula]. The primality of maximal filters can be proved similarly.

Conversely, assume that all maximal ideals and filters in L are prime. To show (i), assume that a,c∈L, [formula]. By the Zorn lemma, there exists a maximal ideal I containing [formula]. By our assumption, I is prime. Then [formula] is a congruence on L. Since c∈I, we have (0,c)∈α, which implies that θ(0,c)  ⊆  α. Since a∈I, we have [formula], hence [formula]. This shows (i). The proof of (ii) is similar.

By [\cite=ce], a bounded lattice is called "balanced", if the 0-class of any congruence determines the 1-class, and conversely. They showed that complemented lattices are balanced, and they asked:

Is there a d-lattice which is balanced but not complemented?

We use the above characterization of d-lattices to answer this question.

If A is a subset of an algebra, write θA for the smallest congruence that identifies all elements of A; if φ is a congruence, x an element, write x / φ for the φ-congruence class of x.

Further, a congruence φ (on an algebra with constants 0 and 1) is called balanced if 0 / φ  =  0 / θ(1 / φ) and 1 / φ  =  1 / θ(0 / φ); an algebra is called balanced iff all its congruence relations are balanced, or equivalently if: for any congruence relations φ, φ' we have:

0 / φ  =  0  /  φ' iff 1 / φ  =  1  /  φ'.

Fix a d-lattice [formula]. For a∈L we denote [formula], and [formula].

Fa is a filter, Ia is an ideal.

Let x,y∈Fa. Similarly as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=charact], (x,1)∈θ(0,a), (y,1)∈θ(0,a), hence [formula], which by the definition of a d-lattice implies [formula]. The proof for Ia is similar.

If I is an ideal disjoint to Fa, and a∉I, then also the ideal generated by [formula] is disjoint to Fa.

If [formula] for some i∈I, and x∈Fa, then also [formula], hence [formula]. Thus, i∈Fa, so [formula].

If f:L1  →  L2 is a homomorphism from L1 onto L2, and L1 is balanced, then L2 is balanced.

In fact, this holds "level-by-level": If φ is an unbalanced congruence on L2, then the preimage of φ is unbalanced on L1.

The following are equivalent (for a d-lattice L):

There is a maximal (hence prime) filter whose complement is not a maximal ideal.

There is a maximal (hence prime) ideal whose complement is not a maximal filter.

There are two prime ideals in L, one properly containing the other.

There are two prime filters in L, one properly containing the other.

There is a homomorphism from L onto the 3-element lattice {0,d,1}.

L is not balanced.

L is not complemented.

In particular a d-lattice is balanced iff it is complemented.

[formula]

(1) →   (3): By [\ref=charact], the complement of a maximal filter is a (necessarily prime) ideal. If this ideal is not maximal, it can be properly extended to a maximal (hence prime) ideal. The proof of (2) →   (4) is similar (dual).

(3) →   (5): Let I1  ⊂  I2  ⊂  L be prime ideals. Map I1 to 0, [formula] to d, and [formula] to 1. Check that this is a lattice homomorphism. The proof of (4) →   (5) is dual.

(5) →   (6) follows from fact [\ref=level], since the three-element lattice is not balanced.

(6) →   (7) is from [\cite=ce].

Now we show (7) →   (1). (Again, (7) →   (2) is dual.) Assume that L is not complemented, so there is some a such that [formula]. Let F1 be the filter generated by [formula]. We have [formula] by the dual of Fact [\ref=dis], so F1 is proper. By the Zorn lemma, F1 can be extended to a maximal filter F. Let [formula]. It is enough to see that I1 is not maximal. Let I be the ideal generated by [formula]. By Fact [\ref=dis], [formula], so I is a proper ideal properly extending I1.
