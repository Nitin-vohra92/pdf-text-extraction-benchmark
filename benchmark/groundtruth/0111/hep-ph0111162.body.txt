The model

It is believed that the nonrelativistic potential model can quite well describe the physics of heavy quarks. It is possible to obtain the whole spectrum of the masses of the quark and antiquark pairs in the quarkonium system, using only potential U(r). Here r denotes a distance between quarks. Unfortunately, there are many different forms of the potential in the literature (see eg. [\cite=cornel], [\cite=potential]) nevertheless up to now the final form has not been fixed. However, it was shown [\cite=motyka] that the most probable potential, in the bottomonia region, is:

[formula]

where C1≃0.71 Gev[formula] and C2≃0.46 Gev[formula]. In the present paper we construct a Lorentz invariant, effective action which provides this potential. The confining part of the potential, i.e. the part which is divergent in spatial infinity, can be obtained from the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory coupled to the scalar field [\cite=dick1], [\cite=dick2], [\cite=chabab]. In particular, in the generalized Dick model [\cite=my], there is a sector where confining potential has the same form as that given by ([\ref=potkacper]). The main defect of the generalized Dick model (from confinement point of view) is the simultaneous existence of the finite energy solutions of the Coulomb problem. In order to preserve only the confining sector one has to add an additional potential term for the scalar field. This potential should have a unique minimum at φ = 0 [\cite=my]. On the other hand, the Motyka-Zalewski potential ([\ref=potkacper]) contains also the well-known, Coulomb part. Because of that our effective action should, in the limit of a strong scalar field, reduce to the simple YM theory. The effective action discussed below can also be regarded as a version of the SU(2) color dielectric model with the special choice of the color dielectric function and scalar potential (see eg. [\cite=pirner1]). Let us consider a model which satisfies the conditions mentioned above:

[formula]

where δ > 0, Λ is a dimensional whereas α a dimensionless constant and Faμν is defined in the standard manner.We would like to stress that the potential for the scalar field has been chosen to give an analytic solution of the Coulomb problem. The field equations for ([\ref=action]) have the following form:

[formula]

[formula]

where jaμ is the external color current.

Solutions

Let us consider a static, pointlike color source:

[formula]

Without loss of generality the Abelian source can be taken. One can consider a non-Abelian source, for example: jaμ  =  4πqδ(r)Caδμ0, where Ca is the expectation value of the su(Nc) generator for a normalized spinor in the color space [\cite=dick1]. However, on account of the fact that the results for these two cases are very similar we will analyze only the Abelian source. The pertinent equations of motion read:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is the electric field defined in the standard way. These equations posses the following solutions:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. This number is positive for sufficiently large values of α. The energy of the solutions is divergent, not only in the small r limit but also in the long range limit, r  →    ∞  . In that sense the confinement emerges. For [formula] the color-electric potential has the form:

[formula]

Let us assume that a color source is a heavy quark. Therefore, the potential seen by an (anti)quark has the following form:

[formula]

The similar calculation can be done for the case [formula]. The result is:

[formula]

For [formula] the potential does not show confinement-like behaviour. There are three general conditions which must be satisfied by a static potential. Namely, it cannot rise faster than linearly as a function of the distance r for r  →    ∞   [\cite=seiler], it has to be a monotonically rising function of r and U''(r)  ≤  0 [\cite=bachas]. Unfortunately, our potential ([\ref=potential2]) satisfies these conditions for all [formula] and we cannot use them to constrain the parameter δ. Potential term in ([\ref=action]) not only excludes single charge states from the physical sector of the theory (i.e. there are no finite energy solutions of the Coulomb problem) but also removes magnetic monopoles. Let us rewrite the equations of motion using the well-known magnetic monopole Ansatz for the gauge field:

[formula]

where g(r) is a function of the radial coordinate only. We get:

[formula]

[formula]

The above set of equations possesses the unique but trivial finite energy solution φ = 0. The finite energy monopoles observed in [\cite=my] do not appear due to the potential term.

Conclusions

We can compare the quark-antiquark potential derived from model ([\ref=action]) with the phenomenological confining Motyka-Zalewski potential. It is immediately seen that they become identical if we set [formula]. However, one can fit the model to another phenomenological potential, which has been successfully applied to calculate quarkonium energy levels, namely to the Cornell potential [formula], where a,b are nonnegative constants [\cite=cornel]. Our potential has the same form in the limit δ  →    ∞  , but it is not feasible to implement this limit on the lagrangian level. So, strictly speaking, our model does not supply the linear divergence of the confining potential but it can be achieved with arbitrary accuracy by taking sufficiently large values of δ. That is the main difference between the Dick model and the model presented here. Contrary to the model considered in [\cite=my], there exists no solution which is non-singular in spatial infinity. It was gained by adding the potential term for the scalar field. There are no magnetic monopoles, either. It is worth stressing that in the model the confinement and disappearance of magnetic monopoles occur simultaneously. There are, at least, two directions in which the present work might be continued. Firstly, the theoretical restrictions for the parameter δ as well as for the particular form of the potential term in the action ([\ref=action]) are needed. Due to the fact that our action belongs to a wide family of color-dielectric actions we believe that these problems can be solved using the lattice color-dielectric methods. In fact much work was done in the past to derive the lattice color dielectric model from the lattice QCD (see eg. [\cite=pirner2], [\cite=pirner3], [\cite=arodz]). For example in paper [\cite=pirner3] the effective scalar potential for [formula] has been computed. One can also use the detailed, lattice study of the flux-tube profile, which was done in the last few years (see eg. [\cite=bali1], [\cite=bali2], [\cite=bali3]) and compare it with the predictions of our model to fix the δ parameter. Secondly, because the finite energy solutions of the Coulomb problem appear for potentials which have a unique minimum for φ  ≠  0, the model can be used to study confinement-deconfinement phase transition.
