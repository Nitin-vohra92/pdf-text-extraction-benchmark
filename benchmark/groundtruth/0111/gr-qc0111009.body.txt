Torsion Gravity Effects on Charged-Particle and Neutron Interferometers

by C. Sivaram and L.C. Garcia de Andrade

Earlier, Anandan [\cite=1] have consider neutron interferometer experiments in spaces with torsion. In his analysis he arrived at conclusion that to produce a phase-shift of [formula] , as in current experiment with thermal neutrons beans, a torsion field of [formula] would be needed. Anandan [\cite=2] also showed that in the Einstein-Cartan of Spin and Torsion these experiments of Collela, Overhauser and Werner (COW) type[\cite=3] [\cite=4] would require a very weak torsion field of [formula]. Just to give an idea of how weaker this field is the torsion field on the surface of the Earth is [formula]. Later Anandan [\cite=5] considered the (SB) experiment[\cite=6] in the gravitational field of the earth. In this paper, I consider the charged-particle interferometry (SB) experiment on torsion backgrounds. The basic new feature here is that the torsion field of the Earth is the one given by Nitsch and Hehl[\cite=7]; (see also Nitsch[\cite=8]) using a PPN aproximation of a translational gauge theory of gravity with torsion. Their result is [formula] Unfortunately, the torsion effects on the phase-shift are small as in the Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) case[\cite=9] [\cite=10] but are interesting from the theoretical point of view. Nevertheless the Sagnac [\cite=11] phase-shift of the Earth rotation on neutron interferometry yields a very interesting application of torsion since Nitsch-Hehl[\cite=7] formula contain a relation between the rotation of the astrophysical objects (planets, stars) and torsion. Which yields a straight forward torsion contribution to the Sagnac effect.

Let us now first consider the extension of SB effect that there must exist an electric field [formula] inside a metallic shell that has no currents. This [formula] satisfies [formula] in the nonrelativistic limit.

The SB idea was proved[\cite=12] inside a hollow cylinder only for temperatures of  <4.2K. Above this temperature, this field undergoes dramatic changes that are not yet understood.

Let us consider the extension of the SB equation to include torsion as:

[formula]

Where [formula] being the wave vector, for a typical electron and the bar denotes averaging over the 3-velocity u and neglecting [formula] terms. The last therm in equation ([\ref=1]) has been computed by Sabbata and Gasperini [\cite=13]. Writing equation ([\ref=1]) in 3-vector rotation yields.

[formula]

Which is the generalization of SB equation to include torsion effects. Just considerating torsion contributions ans electrical effects, we are left with:

[formula]

Which implies for the phase-shift torsion contribution.

[formula]

Where r is the distance between two hollow cylinders in SB experiment. And [formula] for electrons in copper. Considerating the torsion field contribution from the gravitational field of the earth [formula] this effect is extremelly weak.

[formula]

In the nonrelativistic limit of the torsion less case ΔθSB  =    -  Δφcow where Δφcow is the phase-shift of the Collela, Overhauser, Werner (COW) experiment given by [formula] In our case the torsion contribution to the Cow experiment is extremely weak and does not affect the experiment. To see this is enough to check that [formula] which is a very small number to introduce any measurable results on the experiment. Despite of this null result for SB experiment I shall demonstrate next that the influence of torsion on the Sagnac effect is not so small.

Let us consider a torsion contribution to the Sagnac effect[\cite=14]. This effect is very similar to the London moment equation for a superconductor with an angular velocity [formula][\cite=5].

[formula]

The Sagnac effect yields a phase-shift as:

[formula]

Where S is a surface spanned by the neutron beans in the neutron interferometry experiment. [formula] is the earth's rotation in the case of terrestial experiments. By inverting the Nitsch-Hehl formula one obtains a relation for [formula] in therms of torsion.

[formula]

Where [formula] is the Schwaszschild radius. Substituion of ([\ref=8]) into ([\ref=7]) one obtains a Sagnac phase-shift due to torsion.

[formula]

In the case of the earth, [formula] , [formula] and [formula]. Substitution of these data into ([\ref=9]) yields.

[formula]

This gives some hope to detect torsion increasing the α area enclosed by the neutron beams, for terrestial laboratories experiments a typical value for the area is [formula] , for this value the Sagnac-torsion effect is [formula] which is a small value to be detected. This is of the same order of the Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) effect on iron magnet rotating tube.

For example the A-B effect computed by H.Peng [\cite=14] the phase-shift is given by:

[formula]

Where m is the particle's mass and [formula] is the gravitomagnetic field. For electrons [formula] which is much weaker than the torsion contribution to the Sagnac phase-shift. More on this can be found on a recent paper by Garcia de Andrade and Sivaram on the Torsion Gravitational A-B Effect[\cite=10].

A more recent account on the Sagnac effect on neutron interferometry has been considered recently by B.Mashoom in the framework of Special Relativity. A more detailed investigation on the torsion influence on the Sagnac effect can appear elsewhere.
