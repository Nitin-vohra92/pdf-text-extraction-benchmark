The generation of an entangled four-photon state from two pairs of entangled two-photon states by using linear optical elements

The generation of entangled states plays a central role in quantum optics. An experimental realization in this context can be achieved with trapped ions [\cite=qkc], cavity QED [\cite=ar] and Bose-Einstein condenses [\cite=am]. Many schemes were proposed for the purpose of generating entangled quantum states atoms [\cite=sch]. In fact, the GHZ-state was demonstrated with the trapped ion stored in an atom cavity system [\cite=ss] [\cite=ar]. A broad field of research is opened by experiments performed with entangled photons. Photon entanglement can be used to test Bell's inequality [\cite=daa] or to implement quantum information protocols for quantum teleportation [\cite=db], quantum dense coding [\cite=km] and quantum cryptography [\cite=ds]. Recently, an experimental realization of GHZ-states by means of three or four photons was reported [\cite=dj]. The efficient quantum computation with linear optics has been put forward [\cite=erg]. This kind of scheme can be used directly to generate photon polarization entanglement. A sequence of beam splitters is arranged carefully in order to implement a basic non-deterministic gate. Another feasible linear optical scheme [\cite=zjy] was proposed to produce photon polarization entanglement with the help of single-photon quantum non-demolition measurements on an atom-cavity system [\cite=pjj]. In a recent paper [\cite=zxb] we proposed a scheme to generate entangled N-photon states of the form [formula] via linear optical elements. Recently, the incentive to produce entangled states of spin-s objects (S > 1 / 2) has been increased significantly by the advance of the fields of quantum communication and quantum information processing [\cite=gp] [\cite=kp] [\cite=ddd]. Stimulated by experiment[\cite=dj], in this paper, we present a scheme to generate an entangled four-photon state from two pairs of entangled two-photon states

[formula]

by using linear optical elements. This entangled four-photon state is equivalent to two maximally entangled spin-1 particles. Drummond [\cite=pdd] demonstrated the violation of the Bell inequality by this kind of multi-photon states. The experimental setup is shown schematically in Fig.1. We assume that two pairs of maximally entangled two-photon states has been prepared: [formula] and [formula]. The initial state of the system is

[formula]

Let the modes H1, H3, V1, V3, H2, H4, V2 and V4 pass through four beam splitters BS of the same kind. The state of the system evolves into

[formula]

If no photons are detected in the output modes [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], this quantum state is projected into

[formula]

The related probability of success 3 sin 4θ cos 4θ will approach its maximum value 3 / 16, if symmetric beam splitters are used. The quantum state Ψ2 can also be written in the form

[formula]

which is equivalent to the quantum state ([\ref=1]). Now we will demonstrate that the quantum state ([\ref=1]) can be used to generate a telecloning state and to implement quantum telecloning protocol. In [\cite=mur] a telecloning protocol was proposed in order to copy a quantum state from one input to M outputs. In the following we will show, how [formula] optimal quantum cloning can be employed by the use of quantum state ([\ref=1]). The experimental setup is shown schematically in Fig.2. Let mode H1 and V1, H2 and V2 pass through two symmetric beam splitters BS. The state of the system evolves into

[formula]

If we consider only those terms, which correspond to a 4-photon coincidence (one photon in each of the beams), the state of the system is projected into

[formula]

This is exactly a telecloning quantum state, which can be used to perform [formula] optimal quantum cloning [\cite=mur]. If N pairs of polarization entangled photon states of the form [formula] ([formula]) are prepared, we let the modes Hi,Vi,Hi + 1 and Vi + 1 ([formula]) pass through four symmetric N-port beam splitters [\cite=zzze]. At the output mode of each N-port symmetric beam splitter N - 1 detectors are used to detect photons from the second output mode to the Nth output mode. If all detectors do not detect a photon, the state of the system is projected to the entangled 2N-photon state

[formula]

This quantum state corresponds to the quantum state of two maximally entangled spin-[formula] particles. In the theoretical work by Drummond [\cite=pdd] such multi-photon states were used to violate the Bell inequality. In conclusion, a scheme is presented to produce an entangled four-photon state from two pairs of entangled two-photon states. Such entangled four-photon states are equivalent to the state of two maximally entangled spin-1 particles. We further show that such entangled four-photon states can also be used to generate a telecloning state. This state has been used to implement [formula] optimal quantum cloning. This scheme can be generated in order to prepare an entangled 2N-photon state from N pairs of entangled two-photon states. Such multi-photon states may play a crucial role in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics versus local realism and in many quantum information and quantum computation schemes.
