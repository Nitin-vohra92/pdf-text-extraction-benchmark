The Sznajd model of consensus building with limited persuasion

The Sznajd model, where two people having the same opinion can convince their neighbours on the square lattice, is modified in the sense of Deffuant et al and Hegselmann, that only neighbours of similar opinions can be convinced. Then consensus is easy for the competition of up to three opinions but difficult for four and more opinions.

Studies of Ising models and cellular automata for social phenomena have a long tradition [\cite=old]. The Sznajd model [\cite=sznajd] is one of the current sociophysics models of human interactions. It assumes that a pair of neighbouring sites ("people") on a square or other lattice convince their neighbours if and only if the two people in the pair share the same opinion: "United we stand, divided we fall". Bernardes already generalized it from two to q opinions, to describe election results [\cite=bernardes]. One finds that starting with a random initial distribution of opinions, after some time a consensus is formed when everybody has the same opinion.

From a different direction, Deffuant et al [\cite=deffuant] and Hegselmann [\cite=hegselmann] simulated persuasion processes with a continuous spectrum of opinions between 0 and 1, where one person can convince neighbours of the own central opinion only if their opinion differ by a small amount ε from the central opinion. Replacing 1 / ε by q we get a similar discrete model with opinions 1,2, ... q, if only neighbours differing in their opinion by ±  1 from the central opinion are convinced. We now combine this model with the Sznajd principle that only pairs of identical opinions are convincing.

Thus every "Potts" spin [formula] on a square lattice is in one of q different states. A randomly selected pair < Si,Sk  >   of nearest neigbours < i,k >  may convince its six neighbours only if Si = Sk; then it actually convinces a neighbour j if and only if |Sj - Si|  =  1.

It is plausible and well known from building coalitions in parliaments that consensus is the more difficult the larger the number q of opinions is. For q = 2 in the present model, each opinion is close enough to the other opinion to be convinced, the restriction |Sj - Si|  ≤  1 becomes meaningless, and the standard Sznajd model is recovered. For q = 3 at least opinion 2 can convince everybody with a different opinion. For q = 4, on the other hand, opinion 1 is well separated from opinion 4, and a phase separation into different never changing domains is possible. We check by Monte Carlo simulation whether such theoretically possible results actually are reached.

Thus we start with the initial opinions randomly distributed with equal weight over the square lattice, and follow then the above kinetics until all spins are the same, or until nothing changes anymore, for 31  ×  31 to 301  ×  301 lattices. We then found that for q = 3 nearly always all spins became parallel, Si = 2, after some time, while for q = 4 nearly always they got stuck in an inhomogeneous fixed point. In rare cases, q = 3 went to an inhomogeneous fixed configuration, and q = 4 to a never-ending dynamics or to all parallel.

For q = 3 the dominance of the centrist opinion Si = 2 over the two more extreme opinions 1 and 3 comes from the fact that 1 and 3 only can convince neighbours of opinion 2, while opinion 2 can change opinions 1 and 3. If instead we assume cyclicity, that opinion 1 can convince both 2 and q, and opinion q can convince both opinion 1 and q - 1, then all q states become equivalent. Actually, for q = 3 in this case one has no limit on persuasion since each opinion can change the other two opinions, and we return to the standard Sznajd model with q opinions [\cite=bernardes] where for all q at the end all spins seem to be parallel. For q  ≥  4, there is still a limit on persuasion, and again we end up mostly in inhomogeneous fixed points. Thus the cyclicity does not change the boundary between q = 3 and 4: Usually, for q  ≤  3 we reach consensus and for q  ≥  4 we don't.

It depends on the interpretation of the model whether we regard the case of all spins parallel as desirable (consensus) or not (dictatorship).
