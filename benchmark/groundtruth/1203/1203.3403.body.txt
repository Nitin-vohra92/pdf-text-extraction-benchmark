Introduction

While stars form from prestellar cores, cores themselves form from larger structures, often having filamentary shapes. Understanding the physical connection between cores and associated filaments is central to establishing a broader picture of star formation in the Galaxy. Recent observations with the Herschel space observatory [\citep=pilbratt2010] have revealed the ubiquity of complex networks of filaments in nearby interstellar clouds [\citep=andre2010], as well as in more distant and massive clouds [\citep=molinari2010] [\citep=hill2011]. The unprecedented sensitivity of both Herschel imaging cameras PACS [\citep=poglitsch2010] and SPIRE [\citep=griffin2010] facilitates the systematic detection of filaments down to AV≃0.1 in amplitude. [\cite=arzoumanian2011] characterized the physical properties (widths and column densities) of such filaments in three Gould Belt regions, and found a relatively uniform filament width of [formula] pc (FWHM), independent of their lengths, or column densities. The origin of such a uniform filament width remains unclear. [\citet=arzoumanian2011] proposed that it could be a consequence of the process of filament formation by the large-scale turbulent compression of interstellar material. Only those filaments reaching the critical mass per unit length Mline,crit  =  2c2s / G [\citep=ostriker1964] would fragment into prestellar cores, and finally form stars [\citep=andre2010]. In standard molecular clouds, the isothermal sound speed cs≃0.2 km s- 1 (for Tk = 10 K) leads to Mline,crit  ~  15 M[formula] pc- 1 (or AV≃8 for filaments of [formula] pc width).

Here, we present new Herschel observations of the Pipe Nebula, one of the closest known star-forming regions. With a distance of d = 145 pc [\citep=alves2007] and only a few identified young stellar objects [\citep=forbrich2009], the Pipe Nebula is a pristine example of a nearby cloud, and an ideal target for the study of filament and core formation. It is mainly composed of an elongated ([formula] pc) dark cloud subdivided into three parts: B59 and the Stem, which are discussed here, and the Bowl, which will be presented in a forthcoming paper. B59 is the only region showing clear signs of star formation activity [\citep=onishi1999] [\citep=forbrich2009], with a small cluster of YSOs located right in its center. Measurements of the morphology of the magnetic field using optical dust polarisation have also been performed and showed that its direction is mainly orthogonal to the main body of the Pipe [\citep=alves2008] [\citep=franco2010]. Using the indirect method of Chandrasekhar & Fermi, these authors estimated a magnetic field strength of a few tens of μG. While these authors claimed that the Pipe Nebula structure has been mostly shaped by the magnetic field, [\citet=heitsch2009] proposed that gravity alone drives the evolution of the entire complex. These two examples illustrate the controversy about the star formation processes operating in this interesting region.

Herschel imaging observations

We present SPIRE/PACS parallel mode observations of the Pipe Nebula obtained as part of the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (GBS; André et al. 2010). This observing mode allows the simultaneous observations in 5 bands centered at 70/160 μm for PACS and 250/350/500 μm for SPIRE. The Herschel GBS Pipe data consist of three fields roughly corresponding to the three parts of this dark cloud (B59, Stem, and Bowl, see Sect. 1); only those corresponding to the Stem and B59 regions are presented here. The PACS data were reduced with improved calibration within HIPE 7.0. After standard HIPE data reduction steps, up to level 1, the maps were produced with v10 of Scanamorphos [\citep=roussel2012]. The SPIRE data were reduced with HIPE 7.1956, using modified pipeline scripts. Data taken during the turnarounds at the map borders were included, and a destriper module with a polynomial baseline of order zero was applied. The two cross-linked coverages were then combined using the default 'naive-mapper' to produce the final map.

Column density distribution

An important output of the Herschel parallel mode imaging observations are column density maps. We recovered the Herschel zero-flux levels of the Pipe fields by correlating the Herschel data with Planck and IRAS data [\citep=bernard2010]. To construct column density maps, we performed pixel-by-pixel grey-body fitting from 160 μm to 500 μm, fixing the specific dust opacity such that [formula] cm2 g- 1 [\citep=hildebrand1983] and leaving the H2 column density and dust temperature as free parameters. This calculation was done everywhere PACS and SPIRE data were both available. Due to coverage differences between the two instruments in parallel mode observations, a small fraction of the field (on the edge - see Fig. [\ref=skel]) has only SPIRE data. For these pixels, we used a single temperature Tdust = 15.4 K, i.e, the median temperature in the field, along with the 500 μm data to recover the column density structure. The resulting 36 resolution column density map is shown as a background image in Fig. [\ref=skel] (see also online Fig. [\ref=cdmap]). On this Figure, the densest region in the western part corresponds to the well-known B59 cluster-forming clump [\citep=covey2010], while the rest of the map corresponds to the Stem. Both regions show a rich network of filaments and cores. An interesting feature of this map is the sharp, 3 pc long, bow-like edge on the western side of B59 which is associated with a~  30% increase of the background column density between either side of this edge (see Fig. [\ref=filprof]). Also, note that only a small fraction (i.e. 0.6%) of the mapped region corresponds to material above [formula] (see online Fig. [\ref=cdmap], where we use the conversion factor from [\citet=bohlin1978]: NH2≃0.94  ×  AV  ×  1021 cm- 2), the extinction threshold above which prestellar core and protostar formation is believed to take place [\citep=heiderman2010] [\citep=andre2010].

Analysis of the filamentary structure

Filament selection

To characterize the filamentary structure of the Pipe, we used the DisPerSE algorithm [\citep=sousbie2011] to trace the central crests of all filaments having AV  ≥  2 (see Fig. [\ref=skel]). The goal here is to select a set of filaments that we can directly see by eye in the Herschel column density map, the question of the completeness of the filament extraction procedure being beyond the scope of this paper. For this reason, we inspected by eye the filament network obtained with DisPerSE from the Pipe column density map at 36 resolution (i.e. 0.026 pc). We visually selected a final sample of 43 filaments considered as reliable based on their contrast relative to their immediate surrounding background. Although this small sample is not meant to be statistically complete, we checked that the position angle distribution (measured east of north, see Appendix) of the selected filaments is representative of the full network. Online figure [\ref=histo_pa_all] shows both distributions. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on these indicates that there is a probability of [formula] that the corresponding filament samples have the same parent distribution. We are thus confident that the conclusions of the paper do not depend on this filament selection.

Organization and transverse profiles of the filaments

The identified network of filaments shows some interesting features (see online Fig. [\ref=zoom]). While the Stem filaments are organized in a regular, grid-like, pattern, the B59 network is organized differently, with filaments converging toward the centre of the clump, in a manner reminiscent of a hub-like clump [\citep=myers2009]. This can be better visualized by measuring the position angle (P.A.) of each of the red and cyan filaments in Fig. [\ref=skel], and constructing the histograms of filament P.A. for both B59 and Stem regions. Figure [\ref=histo_pa] shows that there are mostly two preferential orientations in the Stem, at [formula] and [formula], nearly 90 from each other. No such trend is observed in B59, despite the low number statistics. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that there is only a [formula] chance that the two samples of filaments in the Stem and in B59 have the same parent distribution of position angles.

We derived average radial column density profiles for all identified filaments, as shown in Fig. [\ref=filprof] for two examples. As in [\citet=arzoumanian2011], we fitted the inner part of the background-subtracted filament profiles with a Gaussian function. Based on these Gaussian fits, we estimate an average deconvolved FWHM width for the Pipe filaments of [formula] pc (see online Fig. [\ref=histowidth]), close to the characteristic value of 0.1 pc found by [\citet=arzoumanian2011] in other nearby interstellar clouds observed as part of the Herschel GBS. In the Pipe, the majority of filaments are subcritical, with Mline  <  Mline,crit. Most importantly, we also find several filaments showing clear asymmetric transverse profiles. Asymmetric profiles are found at different locations along the Pipe complex, i.e. near the bow-like edge of B59, but also in the Stem. For low-density filaments, the background definition is important. In this paper, we chose a constant background at the level of the weaker profile wing (such as in Fig. [\ref=filprof]) since it is the one illustrating the best the asymmetry in the profiles. In practice, this background definition has little influence (less than a factor of 2) on the filament widths we measure. To quantify this asymmetry, we calculated an asymmetry parameter, defined as the ratio of the integrated column density on either side of the profile peak (e.g., the blue shaded area over the yellow shaded area in Fig. [\ref=filprof]). We integrated over the same range of radii on either side of the filament crests (maximum of 0.2 pc, i.e. the default value). However, this range of radii can differ from filament to filament according to the scatter in the wings of the profiles (due, e.g., to nearby cores or filaments). Figure [\ref=filorien] shows this column density ratio as a function of the position angle of the filaments. We clearly see that the most asymmetric filaments are oriented around [formula] (i.e., nearly vertical in Fig. [\ref=skel]), with higher column density found on their eastern sides (e.g. , for filaments with P.A [formula], the blue shaded area in Fig. [\ref=filprof] lies east - cf Appendix). This trend is only observed around this specific filament orientation.

Discussion

Filament formation by large-scale compression ?

The asymmetric filament profiles discussed above (cf. Fig. [\ref=filprof]), along with the presence of a bow-like edge of B59, suggest that several of the filamentary structures have been at least influenced, and possibly formed, by a compression flow coming from the western side of the Pipe Nebula. Interestingly, [\citet=degeus1992] and [\citet=onishi1999] proposed that winds from the Sco OB2 association ([formula] [\citealt=dezeeuw1999]), located 30 pc away from the Pipe, could be responsible for triggering star formation in B59. [\citet=onishi1999] also showed that the energetics from this association were sufficient to influence the Pipe Nebula density structure. The Sco OB2 association lies to the west of B59, away from the Pipe main body (see online Fig. [\ref=scoob2]). It is reasonable to propose that the asymmetric filaments are (being) formed by a compression powered by the Sco OB2 association. The interaction between this compressive flow and the Pipe provides a unique opportunity to study the complex mechanism of filament formation.

Turbulence-generated compressive flows have been proposed to be the main driver of filament formation in the interstellar medium [\citep=padoan2001] [\citep=arzoumanian2011]. The chaotic nature of turbulence, however, makes detailed analysis of such compressed filaments difficult. In the case of the Pipe, we see this compression as a special configuration of turbulent shocks. Here, a shock front is travelling along a well-defined direction, as opposed to many shock fronts with random directions, simplifying the problem. The fact that the widths of the Pipe filaments (see Sect. 4 and online Fig. [\ref=histowidth]) match the characteristic value of 0.1 pc found by [\citet=arzoumanian2011] in other nearby interstellar clouds supports the idea that wind compression and turbulent compression are closely related mechanisms. Note, however, that the Sco OB2 winds can compress material only on the surface of the cloud. As opposed to turbulent compression, these winds cannot therefore be responsible for the formation of filaments lying inside the cloud volume.

As illustrated in Figs. [\ref=filorien] and [\ref=cdmap], the direction of the magnetic field [\citep=franco2010] is nearly parallel to the compressed filaments observed in the Stem. While such similar orientations could be coincidental, in the following, we briefly discuss a mechanism which may be partly responsible for aligning the magnetic field lines and the compressed filaments. Under the assumption of magnetic flux conservation, compression amplifies the magnetic field component parallel to a compressed layer but leaves the component perpendicular to the layer unaffected. As a consequence, the magnetic field lines will become nearly parallel to the layer in the case of significant cloud compression. Assuming a plane-parallel compression, the combination of mass and magnetic flux conservation implies that the magnetic field amplification in compressed layers or filaments can be expressed as AB  =  B/  /post / B/  /pre  =  npost / npre, where the post and pre suffixes stand for post-shock and pre-shock quantities, B/  / is the strength of the magnetic field component parallel to the shock front, and n is the volume density. The pre-shock volume density can be approximated by the average volume density in the Pipe complex, i.e., ~  103 cm- 3 [\citep=onishi1999]. The post-shock volume density is given by the density in the central part of the filaments which, based on the present Herschel data, is estimated to be [formula] cm- 3. These values suggest AB≃10. Such an amplification is sufficiently large that it may be partly responsible for the observed alignment between magnetic field lines and the compressed filaments.

We might expect that compression of a molecular cloud by a large-scale flow will form shells rather than filaments. The fact that the observed width of filaments is uniform (cf. online Fig. [\ref=histowidth]), however, favours the filament geometry. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that shells quickly fragment into filamentary structures. As argued by [\citet=nagai1998], when the ram pressure of a compressive flow dominates the pressure within a magnetized shocked layer, then the layer will fragment into a set of filaments whose main axes lie within the layer, parallel to the amplified component of the magnetic field. Conversely, when the compressed layer is self-gravitating, it will fragment in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. This mechanism would lead to the formation of bound or unbound filaments whose masses per unit length are above or below, respectively, the critical value of [formula] M[formula] pc- 1 (or, equivalently, a column density of [formula] cm- 2 for 0.1 pc-wide filaments, see Sect. 1). This mechanism could also explain why some of the Pipe filaments, whose column densities are below this critical value (online Fig. [\ref=cdmap]), are roughly aligned with the magnetic field.

Filaments and star formation in B59

B59 differs from the rest of the Pipe Nebula. It is the only portion of the complex which is forming stars [\citep=forbrich2009]. In addition, the bow-like front and the sharp edge on the western side of B59 provide a strong indication that it is interacting with a large-scale external compressive flow coming from the west. We propose that such a compression may have enhanced, in a "snow plough" fashion, the column density contrast of the original B59 clump, rendering it prone to global gravitational collapse [\citep=peretto2006]. This scenario is consistent with the different timescales involved. The Sco OB2 association has an estimated age of ~  5 Myr [\citep=degeus1989] and the B59 cluster an age of [formula] Myr [\citep=covey2010]. These ages are consistent with a sequential star formation scenario in which the Sco OB2 wind compression has triggered star formation in B59. Note that the star formation activity in Ophiuchus (online Fig. [\ref=scoob2]) has also likely been triggered by the Sco OB2 winds [\citep=nutter2006].

Finally, the different patterns between the nearly grid-like filament network of the Stem and the centrally converging network of B59 (see Sect. 3 and online Fig. [\ref=zoom]) may be interpreted as a consequence of two different physical regimes. The Stem filamentary structures appear to be mostly subcritical (with Mline  <  Mline,crit) and show a pattern reflecting the initial conditions of their formation. In contrast, the gravity dominates in B59 (Franco et al. 2010, see also online Fig. [\ref=cdmap]) and may have therefore organized the filamentary structures in a pattern converging toward the center of mass of the contracting protocluster. Such hub-like structures are observed in many other star-forming regions (Myers 2009, see also Schneider et al. 2012 for another Herschel example), and might point toward a common pattern of gravitationally unstable clumps. Local feedback from collimated protostellar outflows, however, may also have influenced, on smaller scales, the morphology of some of the observed B59 filaments [\citep=cabral2012]. While the question of the relative impact of large-scale compression, gravity and protostellar outflows remains open in B59, we believe that large-scale compression is a plausible mechanism for the initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of complex.

Angle definition and filament orientation measurement

All angles in this paper are defined in the same frame, using the standard definition of position angles, measured east of north, i.e. 0 toward the north and positive angles counterclockwise. The orientation of filaments is measured between -90 and +90 . Tangent angles are first calculated along the crest of each filament. The median value of these tangent angles provides the filament orientation while the absolute deviation around the filament orientation provides the angle uncertainty used in Fig. [\ref=filorien].

To construct average column density profiles such as those shown in Fig. [\ref=filprof], we first constructed a series of profiles, one per pixel along the filament crest, in the direction perpendicular to the local tangent. Before averaging these local profiles together, we have to ensure that they are similarly oriented (e.g. east part of each local profile averaged together). For this purpose, we followed each filament in the direction of the filament orientation, always starting by constructing the local profile toward positive angles, i.e. counterclockwise. The asymmetry parameter was always calculated by integrating the positive side (blue shaded area on Fig. [\ref=filex]) over the negative one (yellow shaded area). This convention implies that for a filament position angle of 0, an asymmetry parameter above 1 means that the eastern side exhibits higher column density.
