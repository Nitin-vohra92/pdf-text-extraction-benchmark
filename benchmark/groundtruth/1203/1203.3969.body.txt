Abstract

Cantor primes are primes p such that 1 / p belongs to the middle-third Cantor set. One way to look at them is as containing the base-3 analogues of the famous Mersenne primes, which encompass all base-2 repunit primes, i.e., primes consisting of a contiguous sequence of 1's in base 2 and satisfying an equation of the form p  +  1  =  2q. The Cantor primes encompass all base-3 repunit primes satisfying an equation of the form 2p  +  1  =  3q, and I show that in general all Cantor primes >  3 satisfy a closely related equation of the form 2pK  +  1  =  3q, with the base-3 repunits being the special case K  =  1. I use this to prove that the Cantor primes >  3 are exactly the prime-valued cyclotomic polynomials of the form [formula] (mod 4). Significant open problems concern the infinitude of these, making Cantor primes perhaps more interesting than previously realised.

Introduction

Any base-N repunit prime p is a cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at N, Φq(N), with q also prime, i.e.,

[formula]

It is therefore expressible as a contiguous sequence of 1's in base N. For example, p  =  31 satisfies (1) for N  =  2 and q  =  5 and can be expressed as 11111 in base 2. The term repunit was coined by A. H. Beiler [\cite=BEIL] to indicate that numbers like these consist of repeated units.

The case N  =  2 corresponds to the famous Mersenne primes on which there is a vast literature [\cite=GUY]. They are sequence number A000668 in The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences [\cite=SLOANE] and are exactly the prime-valued cyclotomic polynomials of the form [formula] (mod 4).

In this note I show that Cantor primes can be characterised in a similar way as being exactly the prime-valued cyclotomic polynomials of the form [formula] (mod 4). They are primes whose reciprocals belong to the middle-third Cantor set C3.

It is easily shown that C3 contains the reciprocals of all base-3 repunit primes, i.e., those primes p which satisfy an equation of the form 2p  +  1  =  3q with q prime. C3 is a fractal consisting of all the points in

An Exponential Equation Characterising All Cantor Primes

A prime number p  >  3 is a Cantor prime if and only if it satisfies an equation of the form 2pK  +  1  =  3q where q is the order of 3 modulo p and K is a sum of non-negative powers of 3 each smaller than 3q.

Comment. The base-3 repunit primes are then the special case in which K  =  30  =  1. An example is 13, which satisfies 2p  +  1  =  33. A counterexample which shows that not all Cantor primes are base-3 repunit primes is 757, which satisfies 26p  +  1  =  39 with K  =  30  +  31  +  32  =  13 and q  =  9.

Proof. Each x∈C3 can be expressed in ternary form as

[formula]

where all the ak are equal to 0 or 2. The construction of C3 amounts to systematically removing all the points in

Cantor Primes as Cyclotomic Polynomials

Let n be a positive integer and let ζn be the complex number e2πi / n. The [formula] cyclotomic polynomial is defined as The degree of Φn(x) is φ(n) where φ is the Euler totient function. There is now a powerful body of theory relating to cyclotomic polynomials and discussions of their basic properties can be found in any textbook on abstract algebra.

[formula] is irreducible in [formula] if and only if n  =  p and a  =  pk for some prime p and non-negative integer k.

Proof. This is proved as Theorem 4 in [\cite=GRASSL].

A prime number p  >  3 is a Cantor prime if and only if [formula] (mod 4) where s is an odd prime and j is a non-negative integer.

Proof. Assume p is a Cantor prime. By Theorem 2.1 we then have

[formula]

where R(3)q denotes the base-3 repunit consisting of q contiguous units, and q and K are as defined in that theorem. If q is composite, say q  =  rs, we obtain the factorisation

[formula]

If q is prime we can take r  =  1. Therefore in both cases at least one factor of pK must be a base-3 repunit.

If K  =  1 then p  =  R(3)q  =  Φs(3), since q must be prime in this case. (R(3)q is composite if q is). If K  >  1, p is not a base-3 repunit and by Theorem 2.1 K is a sum of powers of 3, so p must be of the general form

[formula]

for some s and r, and K must be a corresponding base-3 repunit R(3)r, otherwise their product could not be R(3)rs. But the polynomial in (16) can only be prime if it is irreducible in [formula]. By Lemma 3.1, this requires s to be a prime number and r  =  sj for some non-negative integer j, and we therefore have p  =  Φs(3sj) in this case. We conclude that in all cases we must have p  =  Φs(3sj) if p is a Cantor prime. Note that s must be an odd prime as Φs(3sj) is even for s  =  2.

Conversely, suppose that p  =  Φs(3sj) is a prime number. Then we can multiply it by the base-3 repunit R(3)r where r  =  sj to get the repunit R(3)q as in (15). Thus, p must satisfy (14) and must therefore be a Cantor prime.

Base-3 repunits are congruent to 0 modulo 4 when they consist of an even number of digits, and to 1 modulo 4 otherwise. Therefore if p  >  3 is a base-3 repunit prime it must be of the form 4k  +  1.

If p is prime but not a base-3 repunit, both r  =  sj and q  =  rs in (15) are odd, so both R(3)q and R(3)r are base-3 repunits with odd numbers of digits, and thus of the form 4k  +  1. It follows that p is also of the form 4k  +  1 in this case.

Open Problems

The infinitude of Cantor primes is currently an open problem shown to be significant in this paper because of the equivalence of Cantor primes and prime-valued cyclotomic polynomials of the form Φs(3sj).

In the case j  =  0, it is known that Φs(3) is prime for s  =   7, 13, 71, 103, 541, 1091, 1367, 1627, 4177, 9011, 9551, 36913, 43063, 49681, 57917, 483611, and 877843. It seems plausible that there are infinitely many such values of s but this remains to be proved.

The Cantor prime 757  =  Φ3(33) is an example with j  >  0. It is again an open problem to prove there are infinitely many integers j  >  0 for which Φs(3sj) is prime given a prime s, though all such cyclotomic polynomials must be irreducible.

Previous studies have considered the infinitude of prime-valued cyclotomic polynomials of other types. For example, primes of the form Φs(1) and Φs(2) are studied in [\cite=GALLOT], and other cases are discussed in [\cite=DAMIANOU].
