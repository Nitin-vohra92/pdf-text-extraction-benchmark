Introduction

In the projective space PG(r,q) over the Galois Field GF(q), a n-cap is a set of n points no 3 of which are collinear. A n-cap is called complete if it is not contained in a (n + 1)-cap. For a detailed description of the most important properties of these geometric structures, we refer the reader to [\cite=Hir]. In the last decades the problem of determining the spectrum of the sizes of complete caps has been the subject of a lot of researches. For a survey see [\cite=18secondo]. In this work we search for the classification of complete and incomplete caps in PG(5,2), using an exhaustive search algorithm. In Section [\ref=alg] the algorithm utilized is illustrated; in Section [\ref=risultati] the complete list of non equivalent complete and incomplete caps is presented.

The searching algorithm

In this section the algorithm utilized is presented. Our goal is to obtain the classification of complete and incomplete caps in PG(5,2). It is not restrictive to suppose that a cap in PG(5,2) contains this six points: Then we define the set Cand of all the points lying no 2-secant of R. We introduce in Cand the following equivalence relationship:

where [formula] means that the two sets are projectively equivalent. This relationship spreads the candidates in equivalent classes [formula]. The choice of the next point to add to the building cap can be made only among the representatives of the equivalent classes, in fact two caps one containing [formula] and the other one [formula], with P and Q in [formula], are equivalent by definition of orbit. Suppose now that we have construct all the caps containing [formula], with [formula]. Considering the caps containing [formula] with [formula], all the points of the classes Ck with [formula] can be avoided. In fact a cap containing [formula], with [formula] and [formula], is projectively equivalent to a cap containing [formula], already studied. When we add a new point to the cap, we can divide all the remaining candidates in equivalence classes, as above. Two points P and Q are in relationship with the j-th class Cj, i.e. P  ~  jQ, if [formula] and [formula] are projectively equivalent. At the m-th step of the extension process if the cap [formula] is projectively equivalent to the cap [formula] with [formula], then P and Q are in relationship ([formula]) and they belong to the same class [formula]. Iterating the process we can build a tree similar to the following:

The tree is important to restrict the number of candidates in the extension process. Suppose that we have generated a n-cap containing the cap [formula], after having generated n-caps containing [formula] with j < i1, [formula] with j < i2,, [formula] with j < im, with [formula]. Then the points belonging to [formula] can be avoided, because a cap containing one of them is equivalent to one already found. For example a n-cap containing [formula] with Q∈Ch for some h < i1 is equivalent to a n-cap containing [formula], which is already found.

Results

In this Section all non equivalent caps, complete and incomplete, in PG(5,2) are presented.

Non-equivalent caps K in PG(5,2)

This table shows the number and the type of the non equivalent examples of all the caps.

Description of the caps

In this section we describe each cap of size k + 1, with 7  ≥  k  ≥  31, as union of a cap of size k and a point in PG(5,2). We start from these non equivalent examples of 7-incomplete caps. [formula][formula]

[formula] [formula] We will call these caps C17,C27,C37,C47 respectively. They have stabilizer (O) of size

In the following tables the symbol Cji indicates the j-th cap of size i and [formula] means that the cap is complete. If it is possible to write a cap in two different ways, we choose that one with the lowest value of j.

All the complete caps of sizes 13, 17, 18 and 20 have projective frame. The 32- complete cap has no projective frame.
