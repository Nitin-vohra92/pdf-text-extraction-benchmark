A Note On the Use of Fiducial Limits for Control Charts

Introduction

In many applications using attribute (count) data, the number of nonconformities often has discrete distributions such as the binomial, Poisson and geometric. In this note, we provide the fiducial limits for these distributions because, in certain cases, these limits are often used as the upper and lower limits for control charts.

Early works related to obtaining exact control limits were based on the use of graphs and tables. For example, [\cite=Wortham/Ringer:1972] provide a good review on exact control limits using graphs and tables when the true parameter of the underlying distribution is known. These graphs and tables were used to approximate or interpolate the values needed to obtain an interval with 1 - α confidence level when the parameters of the underlying distribution were known. Before the advent of powerful computers and software, it was often troublesome and time-consuming to compute exact control limits. Thus, the methods that were based on the use of tables and graphs were prevalent in the literature because of their simplicity and convenience.

Unfortunately, the studies that use these graphs and tables are restricted to using the specific confidence interval values that can be inferred from these tables and graphs. Additionally, errors are difficult to avoid because of the required use of visual interpolation. However, with powerful computers and accessible software available, it has now become quite trivial to calculate exact control limits without the use of graphs and tables. Exact control limits are obtained by calculating the corresponding quantiles of the underlying distribution involved. These days, there are many statistical software programs that provide the quantiles for any reasonably common distribution. For example, in [\cite=R], a non-commercial open source statistical software package for statistical computing and graphics, the binomial and Poisson quantile functions are given by qbinom( ) and qpois( ) respectively. R can be obtained at no cost from http://www.r-project.org. Other commercial statistical software such as Minitab and SAS also provide the quantile functions for the commonly known distributions.

Another shortcoming of the control limit methods that use the graphs and tables in [\cite=Wortham/Ringer:1972] is that, in order to use these tables, one has to assume that the parameter of the underlying distribution is known. In many practical examples, the true parameters are not known. As aforementioned, if the true parameter is known, the exact limits are easily calculated by using the quantile functions in the various statistical software packages available. If the parameters are unknown, then the control limits can be obtained by inverting the relation between the tails and the parameters. These control limits are then referred to as fiducial limits in the statistics literature and are explained in more detail in the following section.

Fiducial Limits for the discrete distributions

Many authors, including [\cite=Clopper/Pearson:1934], [\cite=Garwood:1936], [\cite=Stevens:1950], [\cite=Bickel/Kjell:1977], [\cite=Kendall/Stuart:1979], mention the exact or fiducial confidence limits for several discrete distributions, along with the classical confidence limits based on the central limit theorem. In this note, we provide a review of several fiducial limits which can be useful for various control charting methods including the p, u, c and g charts.

The binomial distribution

Let X denote a binomial random variable with size n and Bernoulli probability p. The fiducial limits for p are obtained by inverting the following two equal tails for p where [formula]. The lower and upper limits with 1 - α confidence level are given by where F(ξ)ν1,ν2 denotes the ξ quantile of the F distribution with degrees of freedom ν1 and ν2. Here, the lower limit is 0 if x = 0 and the upper limit is 1 if x = n. Derivations of the fiducial limits for p based on the F distribution are given by [\cite=Blyth:1986], [\cite=Hald:1952], and [\cite=Leemis/Trivedi:1996]. It should be noted that the quantile of the F distribution is calculated by using qf( ) in R.

The Poisson distribution

[\cite=Garwood:1936] provide the fiducial limits for the Poisson distribution. Let [formula] be a random sample from a Poisson distribution with mean λ. For convenience, let [formula]. Then, the random variable Y has a Poisson distribution with mean nλ. Let Y = y, then the lower and upper limits with 1 - α confidence level are given by where Γ(ξ)a,b is the ξ quantile of the gamma distribution with parameters a and b. Here the lower limit is 0 if y = 0. It should be noted that the quantile of the gamma distribution is calculated by using qgamma( ) in R.

The geometric distribution

Let [formula] be a random sample from a geometric distribution with Bernoulli parameter p. For convenience, let [formula]. Then, the random variable Y has a negative binomial distribution with size n and Bernoulli parameter p. Let Y = y, then the lower and upper limits with 1 - α confidence level equal where the upper limit is 1 if y = 0. These limits are provided in Exercise 9.22 of [\cite=Casella/Berger:2002].
