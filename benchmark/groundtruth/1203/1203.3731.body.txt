A Simple Proof of Schmidt's Conjecture

For any integer r  ≥  1, the sequence of numbers {c(r)k}k  ≥  0 is defined implicitly by

[formula]

In 1992, Asmus Schmidt [\cite=Schmidt] conjectured that all c(r)k are integers. In Concrete Mathematics [\cite=Knuth] on page 256, it was stated as a research problem. Already here, it was indicated that H. Wilf had shown the integrality of c(r)n for any r but only for n  ≤  9. For the first nontrivial case, r = 2; [formula] are the famous Apéry numbers, the denominators of rational approximations to ζ(3). This case was proved in 1992 independently by Schmidt himself [\cite=Schmidt1] and by Strehl [\cite=Strehl]. They both gave an explicit expression for c(2)n

[formula]

These numbers are called Franel numbers. In the same paper [\cite=Strehl], Strehl also gave a proof for r = 3 which uses Zeilberger's algorithm of creative telescoping. He also gave an explicit expression for c(3)n

[formula]

The first full proof was given by Zudilin [\cite=Zudilin] in 2004 using a multiple generalization of Whipple's transformation for hypergeometric functions. Since then, the congruence properties related to the Schmidt numbers [formula] and to the Schmidt polynomials [formula] have been studied extensively. In this note, we return to Schmidt's original problem and present a simple proof.

It is a natural first step to investigate the individual term [formula] before considering the full sum [formula]. Our proof rests on the following lemma, which was proved by Guo and Zeng [\cite=Guo2]. In order to keep this note self-contained, we give a simple, well motivated, computer proof of their lemma.

For k  ≥  0 and r  ≥  1, there exist integers a(r)k,j with a(r)k,j = 0 for j  <  k or j  >  rk, and

[formula]

for all [formula].

Define ā(r)k,j recursively by ā(1)k,k = 1, ā(1)k,j = 0 (j  ≠  k) and

[formula]

Then it is clear that ā(r)k,j are integers.

We show by induction on r that ā(r)k,j satisfies [\eqref=main]. The statement is clearly true for r = 1. Suppose the statement is true for r. Then

[formula]

The identity from line 2 to line 3,

[formula]

can be verified easily with Zeilberger's algorithm.

Therefore ā(r)k,j satisfies [\eqref=main]. For the lemma, we can now take a(r)k,j  =  ā(r)k,j.

The definition [\eqref=magic] may seem to come out of nowhere. It was found as follows. We tried to find a relation of the form:

[formula]

with the hope to find a nice formula for s(k,j,i), free of r. The coefficients s(k,j,i) then were found by automated guessing. First we calculated the numbers a(r)k,j for r from 1 to 15 and all k,j. Then we made an ansatz for a hypergeometric term s(k,j,i). Fitting this ansatz to the calculated data and solving the constants led to the conjecture

[formula]

Now we give a proof of the main statement. By the lemma, we have

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

which concludes our statement.
