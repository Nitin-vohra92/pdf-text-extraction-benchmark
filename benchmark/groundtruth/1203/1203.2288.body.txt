Seven Geometrical Means

Let a,  b > 0 be two positive numbers. In 2003, Eves [\cite=eve] studied the geometrical interpretation of the following seven menas:

Arithmetic mean: [formula];

Geometric mean: [formula];

Harmonic mean: [formula];

Heronian mean: [formula];

Contra-harmonic mean: [formula]

Root-mean-square: [formula]

Centroidal mean: [formula]

Except 4 and 7 the above means are particular cases of well-known Gini [\cite=gin] mean of order r and s is given by

[formula]

In particular, we have E- 1,0 = H, E- 1 / 2,1 / 2 = G, E0,1 = A, E0,2 = S and E1,2 = R. Since Er,s = Es,r, the Gini-mean Er,s(a,b) is an increasing function in r or s [\cite=czp]. In view of this we have H  ≤  G  ≤  A  ≤  S  ≤  C. Moreover we can easily verify the following inequality having the above seven means:

[formula]

We can write, M(a,b) = b  fM(a / b), where Mstands for any of the above seven means, then we have

[formula]

where fH(x) = 2x / (x + 1), [formula], [formula], fA(x) = (x + 1) / 2, fR(x) = 2(x2 + x + 1) / 3(x + 1), [formula] and fC(x) = (x2 + 1) / (x + 1), [formula], x  ≠  1. We have equality sign in ([\ref=eq3]) iff x = 1. For simplicity, let us write

[formula]

where fUV(x) = fU(x) - fV(x), with U  ≥  V. Inequalities appearing in ([\ref=eq2]) admits 21 nonnegative differences. Some of these are equal with multiplicative constants as given below:

[formula]

The measures Δ and h appearing in ([\ref=eq5]) and ([\ref=eq6]) are respectively the triangular discrimination [\cite=lec] and Hellingar's distance [\cite=hel] respectively and are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

More studied on these two measures can be seen in [\cite=tan1] [\cite=tan2] [\cite=tan3].

We shall improve considerably the inequalities given in ([\ref=eq2]). For this we need first the convexity of the difference of means. In total, we have 21 differences. Some of them are equal to each other with some multiplicative constants. Some of them are not convex and some of them are convex.

Convexity of Difference of Means

Let us prove now the convexity of some of the difference of means arising due to inequalities ([\ref=eq2]). In order to prove it we shall make use of the following lemma [\cite=tan1] [\cite=tan2].

Let f:I  ⊂  R+  →  R be a convex and differentiable function satisfying f(1) = 0. Consider a function

[formula]

then the function φf(a,b) is convex in R2+. Additionally, if [formula], then the following inequality hold:

[formula]

In all the cases, it is easy to check that fAB(1) = fA(1) - fB(1) = 1 - 1 = 0. According to Lemma 2.1, it is sufficient to show the convexity of the functions fAB(x). It requires only to show that the second order derivative of fAB(x) to be nonnegative for all x > 0. Here below are the second order derivatives of the convex functions:

[formula]

Since, S  ≥  A, this implies that S3  ≥  A3, i.e., [formula]. This gives [formula]. Thus we have f''CS(x)  ≥  0 for all x > 0. The difference means DSR, DNH and DGH are not convex.

Inequalities among of Differences of Means

In this section we shall bring sequence of inequalities based on the differences arising due to ([\ref=eq8]). This we shall present in two parts. The results given in this section are based on the applications of the following lemma [\cite=tan1] [\cite=tan2]:

Let f1,f2:I  ⊂  R+  →  R be two convex functions satisfying the assumptions:

(i) [formula], [formula];

(ii) f1 and f2 are twice differentiable in R+;

(iii) there exists the real constants α,β such that 0  ≤  α  <  β and

[formula]

for all x > 0 then we have the inequalities:

[formula]

for all a,b∈(0,  ∞  ), where the function φ(  ·  )(a,b) is as defined in Lemma 2.1.

The inequalities appearing in ([\ref=eq2]) admits 21 nonnegative differences. The differences satisfies some simple inequalities. These are given by the following pyramid:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where the DGH = G - H, DNG = N - G, DCS = C - S, etc. As we have seen above some of these differences are equals with multiplicative constants.

The difference means DSR, DNHand DGH are not convex. The other convex measures satisfies some interesting inequalities with each other given by the theorem below.

The following inequalities hold:

[formula]

We shall prove above result by parts. Here we shall use frequently the second order derivatives given in section 2.

Proportionality Relations among Means

As a part of ([\ref=eq19]), let us consider the following inequalities:

[formula]

The expression ([\ref=eq31]) has six means istead of seven. For simplicity, let us rewrite the expression ([\ref=eq31]):

[formula]

where for example [formula], [formula], [formula], etc. The inequalities ([\ref=eq32]) again admits 10 nonnegative differences. These differences satisfies some natural inequalities given in a pyramid below:

[formula]

where D1W2W1: = W2 - W1, D16W7W6: = W7 - W6, etc. Interestingly, the above 10 nonnegative differences are equals to each other by some multiplicative constants:

[formula]

Based on the expressions ([\ref=eq4]), ([\ref=eq5]), ([\ref=eq6]) and ([\ref=eq33]) we have the following proportionality relations among the six means:

4A = 2(C + H) = 3R + H;

3R = C + 2A = 2C + H;

3N = 2A + G;

3C + 2H = 3R + 2A;

C + 3N = G + 3R;

3N + 2A = 2C + 2H + G;

27R + 2G = 14A + 9C + 6N;
