The model companion of the class of pseudocomplemented semilattices is finitely axiomatizable

Introduction

The notion of existential closedness is motivated by the notion of an algebraically closed field. In the class of fields existential and algebraic closedness coincide: If [formula] is a field and [formula] and [formula] are polynomials over [formula], then the satisfiability of the negated equation [formula] is equivalent to the satisfiability of the equation [formula]. Thus every system of negated equations over [formula] can be replaced by a system of equations.

However, the following examples show that this is not the general situation: In the class of boolean algebras every boolean algebra is algebraically closed whereas a boolean algebra [formula] is existentially closed if and only if [formula] is atomfree. An abelian group [formula] is algebraically closed if and only if [formula] is divisible, whereas [formula] is existentially closed if and only if [formula] is divisible and contains an infinite direct sum of copies of [formula] (as a module). For a more detailed description of the notion of algebraic and existential closedness we refer the reader to [\cite=Mac].

As [formula] is a finitely generated universal Horn class with both the amalgamation and joint embedding property [formula] has a model companion, see [\cite=AbBu] for details. The model companion need not exist with the class of groups serving as an example. Furthermore, we have that if the set Σ of [formula]-sentences is the model companion of [formula], then the class of models of Σ is exactly ec. Thus, proving that ec is finitely axiomatizable solves the problem posed by Albert and Burris in the final paragraph of [\cite=AbBu].

An axiomatizable class of L-structures is finitely axiomatizable if and only if both the class itself as well as its complementary class are closed under elementary equivalence and ultraproducts. Instead of proving that ec and its complementary class are both closed under elementary equivalence and ultraproducts we specify a finite list of [formula]-sentences that axiomatize ec.

Basic properties of pseudocomplemented semilattices and notation

A pseudocomplemented semilattice [formula] is an algebra where [formula] is a meet-semilattice with least element 0, and for all x,y∈P, [formula] if and only if x  ≤  a*. Instead of "pseudocomplemented semilattice" we use the shorter "p-semilattice".

Obviously, 1: = 0* is the greatest element of P. We define [formula] to hold if neither x  ≤  y nor y  ≤  x holds. An element d of P satisfying d* = 0 is called dense, and if additionally [formula] holds, then d is called a proper dense element. For [formula] the set [formula] denotes the subset of dense elements of [formula], [formula] being a filter of [formula]. An element s is called skeletal if s*  * = s. The subset of skeletal elements of [formula] is denoted by [formula]. The abuse of notation [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula] should not cause ambiguities. Obviously, [formula]. In [formula] the supremum of two elements exists with [formula] for [formula]. Instead of [formula] we use the shorter [formula], assuming [formula]. Observe that [formula] is a boolean algebra. In the subset [formula] of skeletal elements we consider the subset [formula] of central elements of [formula].

For any p-semilattice [formula] the p-semilattice [formula] is obtained from [formula] by adding a new top element. The maximal proper dense element of [formula] is denoted by e. Furthermore, the p-semilattices [formula] with [formula] being a boolean algebra are exactly the subdirectly irreducible p-semilattices. Moreover, let [formula] denote the two-element boolean algebra, [formula] the three-element p-semilattice {0,e,1} and [formula] the countable atomfree boolean algebra. For a survey of p-semilattices consult [\cite=Fr] or [\cite=Jo].

For a p-semilattice [formula] and an arbitrary element a∈P the binary relation [formula] is a congruence. The factor algebra [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], where [formula] is defined by [formula] and [formula] by [formula]. Given the direct product [formula] and [formula] with the first k places being 0, the factor algebra [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Furthermore, the map νa:P  →  P / θa defined by [formula] is a surjective homomorphism.

Finally, we need the notion of a homomorphism over a set: Let [formula] and [formula] be p-semilattices, [formula] a subset of [formula]. We say a homomorphism f:P  →  Q is over [formula] if f(ai) = ai holds for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. If in this situation f is an isomorphism we say that [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic over [formula].

For more background on p-semilattices in general consult [\cite=Fr] and [\cite=Jo], for the notions concerning the problem tackled in this paper consult [\cite=RAS].

The class ac

On various occasions we will use the following -- semantic -- characterization of algebraically closed p-semilattices, established in [\cite=Sc3].

A p-semilattice [formula] is algebraically closed if and only if for any finite subalgebra [formula] there exist [formula] and a p-semilattice [formula] isomorphic to [formula] such that [formula].

In [\cite=RAS] the following list of axioms is introduced to axiomatize the class of algebraically closed p-semilattices.

Let [formula] be a p-semilattice. [formula] will be said to satisfy

The following theorem, the main result of [\cite=RAS], states that the preceding list of axioms together with a finite axiomatization of the class [formula] is a finite axiomatization of the class ac.

A p-semilattice [formula] is algebraically closed if and only if [formula] satisfies the axioms [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4].

A finite axiomatization of ec

Theorem [\ref=theorem_main] states that the list of axioms [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5] below together with the axioms [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4], which axiomatize ac, axiomatize ec. Its proof consists of carrying out the following steps:

We will first show that a p-semilattice [formula] is existentially closed if and only if there is for every finite subalgebra [formula] extendable to a finite subalgebra [formula] within an extension [formula] of [formula] a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] isomorphic to [formula] over S.

Apply Theorem [\ref=theorem_ac_char] to obtain that [formula] and [formula] may be assumed to be direct products of subdirectly irreducible p-semilattices.

Apply Lemma [\ref=lemma_axioms_prod] to obtain that [formula] may be assumed to be a single subdirectly irreducible p-semilattice.

Apply Lemmata [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext1] and [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext2] to distinguish a chain [formula] of subalgebras [formula] of [formula] such that [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula].

The application of Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext] yields that there is a chain [formula] in [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic over S for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Let [formula] be a p-semilattice. [formula] will be said to satisfy

A couple of sentences to explain what the axioms [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5] mean are appropriate. [\ref=EC1] and [\ref=EC4] are the usual density conditions holding in existentially closed posets for skeletal and dense elements. Skeletal and dense elements must be mentioned separately because b1 < b3 < b2 with b1 and b2 skeletal does not imply that b3 is skeletal as well. [\ref=EC3] simply guarantees the existence of a proper dense element. Clearly, an existentially closed p-semilattice must contain a proper dense element since any p-semilattice can be embedded into a p-semilattice with a proper dense element. To understand [\ref=EC2] and [\ref=EC5] diagrams may be helpful.

[\ref=EC2] ensures that a finite subalgebra [formula], 1  ≤  f(i), of a p-semilattice [formula] satisfying [\ref=EC2] can be extended in [formula] to a subalgebra [formula] isomorphic to [formula] over S for any subalgebra [formula] of an extension [formula] of [formula]. Applying [\ref=EC2] to suitable d,b1,b2∈S yields a skeletal element b3 that behaves with respect to [formula] as the element [formula].

[\ref=EC5] ensures that a finite subalgebra [formula], 1  ≤  f(i), of a p-semilattice [formula] satisfying [\ref=EC5] can be extended in [formula] to a subalgebra [formula] isomorphic to [formula] over S for any subalgebra [formula], 1  ≤  f(q + 1) and [formula], of an extension [formula] of [formula]. Applying [\ref=EC5] to suitable d1,b∈S yields a dense element d2 that behaves with respect to [formula] as the element [formula].

Observe in [\ref=EC4] that d* = 0  &  d < d' implies d'* = 0 as [formula] is a filter of [formula].

Let [formula] be a p-semilattice satisfying [\ref=EC1]. Then the subalgebra [formula] is atomfree and thus existentially closed in [formula] for any p-semilattice [formula] extending [formula].

Let [formula], i∈I, be p-semilattices and [formula]. Then any of the axioms [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5] holds in [formula] if and only if it holds in every [formula] (i∈I).

Straightforward.

To prove the central theorem of this paper we need three more lemmata. The first two lemmata are semantic statements how a finite direct product of finite subdirectly irreducible p-semilattices contains a subdirectly irreducible p-semilattice respectively a product of subdirectly irreducible p-semilattices as a subalgebra. The third lemma is the syntactic counterpart thereof. It states that in a p-semilattice [formula] satisfying the first-order sentences [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5] a finite subdirectly irreducible subalgebra with a proper dense element can be extended to a finite direct product of finite subdirectly irreducible p-semilattices if this can be done in an extension of [formula].

If [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, [formula], f(i)  ≥  1, and [formula] such that [formula], s  ≥  0, then there is a sequence of subalgebras [formula] of [formula] satisfying

[formula],

[formula] for [formula],

[formula],   =  πi(S) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  q,

[formula], 1  ≤  k  ≤  q - 1,

[formula].

First put [formula]. If q = 1 and s = 0 we put [formula], d the only proper dense element of [formula], and [formula] if s > 0. Then set [formula]. Thus we may assume q > 1. If s = 0, that is [formula], let d = 1, else let d be the only element of [formula]. Since [formula] is subdirectly irreducible there is an [formula] such that [formula] contains an isomorphic copy of [formula] and [formula]. We may assume i = 1, which implies [formula], and furthermore

[formula]

|πi(S)| < |S|, 2  ≤  i  ≤  q, implies di = 1: There are elements [formula] such that a*i = bi but [formula]. Then at least one of [formula] and [formula] holds, thus either [formula] or [formula] such that u1 > 0 and ui = 0, implying 1 = u*i  ≤  di. Thus we may assume that there is 1  ≤  r  ≤  q with [formula]. We define

[formula]

for [formula]. Again we consider the cases s = 0 and s > 0. If s = 0 we put [formula], if s > 0 we put [formula]. Next we extend [formula] to a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] that is isomorphic to [formula], [formula] as in [\eqref=stepwise_ext]. We distinguish the cases [\ref=L1_proof_item1]. r = 1, that is [formula], and [\ref=L1_proof_item2]. r  ≥  2.

In this case we have [formula], that is [formula] by [\eqref=stepwise_ext]. We set [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] as [formula] defined by [formula] is an isomorphism: Obviously, φ is a homomorphism. The surjectivity of φ follows from [formula] and [formula] and d1∈T2. The injectivity follows from [\eqref=eq_S_i_decreasing] and the choice of b and d1.

Here we have [formula], that is [formula]. We set [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], which is shown as in [\ref=L1_proof_item1]..

Now we show that a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] can be extended to a subalgebra [formula], 3  ≤  k  ≤  q. Under our assumption we have [formula], where [formula] with the first j places equal to 1 for [formula], and [formula]. Here we need consider two cases, as both for πk(d) = 1 and πk(d) = e we have [formula] for [formula] with the k-th place equal to e.

We define [formula] being isomorphic to [formula] as [formula] defined by [formula] is an isomorphism: Obviously, φ is a homomorphism. The surjectivity of φ follows from [formula] and [formula] and [formula]. Again, the injectivity follows from [\eqref=eq_S_i_decreasing] and the choice of bk and dk.

After q steps we obtain the subalgebra [formula], which is isomorphic to [formula]. If |S1| < ||, there is [formula] such that [formula] and b an anti-atom of [formula] but no anti-atom of [formula]. There is a skeletal element [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. Setting [formula] we obtain using conjunctive normal form for boolean terms and [formula]

[formula]

The right hand side of [\eqref=eq_my_contr] is isomorphic to [formula] if [formula] is such that [formula]. Repeating this procedure for [formula] as long as r1 + m < f(1) yields a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] isomorphic to [formula]. Applying this procedure to the factors [formula] for [formula] finally finishes the proof.

If [formula] with [formula], and [formula] a subalgebra isomorphic to [formula], then there is a sequence of subalgebras [formula] of [formula] with the following properties:

[formula] for [formula],

[formula], [formula] for [formula].

As [formula] there is for every [formula] a maximal dense element [formula] with x  ≤  dx. Therefore we have

[formula]

thus

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq_charakterizing_S] and [\eqref=eq_b_i_2extend] it follows that we can set [formula] and [formula] for [formula].

The following lemma can, as mentioned earlier, be considered the syntactic counterpart of Lemmata [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext1] and [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext2]. Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext],[\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case1]. states that if [formula] is a finite subdirectly irreducible subalgebra of a p-semilattice [formula] that satisfies [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5], then [formula] contains a sequence [formula], [formula], of subalgebras satisfying [formula], [formula], as in Lemma [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext1]. Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext],[\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case2]. is the corresponding statement for the sequence [formula] of Lemma [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext1], whereas Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext],[\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case2]. is the corresponding statement for the sequence [formula] of Lemma [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext2].

Let [formula] and [formula] be p-semilattices, [formula] an extension of [formula], let [formula] be a finite subalgebra of [formula] with [formula], and let p, q and f(i)  ≥  1, 1  ≤  i  ≤  q + 1, be natural numbers. Furthermore, we assume that [formula] is a finite subalgebra of [formula] that is an extension of [formula]. If [formula] satisfies [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5], then we have:

If [formula] and [formula], then there is an extension [formula] of [formula] in [formula] that is isomorphic to [formula] over S.

If [formula] and [formula], then there is an extension [formula] of [formula] in [formula] that is isomorphic to [formula] over S.

If [formula] and [formula], then there is an extension [formula] of [formula] in [formula] that is isomorphic to [formula] over S.

Since [formula] we may assume [formula] identifying the subalgebra [formula] of [formula] with the direct product [formula] is isomorphic to. To simplify notation we define [formula] for x∈T, [formula] if x,y∈T and xi  ≤  yi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, and [formula] if [formula] and xk < yk for a [formula]. Furthermore, we set [formula] if U is a subset of T.

Since [formula] is isomorphic to the direct product of the subdirectly irreducible factors [formula], [formula], and since [formula] is an extension of [formula] we have -- changing the enumeration if necessary -- [formula], which implies πi(S) = πi(T) for [formula]. We define [formula] and consider the cases [\ref=casea] [formula], that is [formula], and [\ref=caseb] [formula]. We will in both cases first attend to the dense elements. We will extend S with a dense element d by applying [\ref=EC4] and [\ref=EC5], respectively. [formula] can then be embedded over S into [formula]. Applying [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] to [formula] yields a subalgebra [formula] such that [formula] can be embedded into [formula] over S. Once more applying [\ref=AC3] and will finally yield the desired subalgebra [formula].

There is a [formula] such that [formula] and πk(x) = πq + 1(x) (after renaming the atoms of [formula] if necessary) for x∈S: [formula] for all [formula] would contradict [formula] being the direct product of subdirectly irreducible factors as we assume [formula]. For a > b there is no embedding of [formula] into   ×   such that the proper dense element of [formula] is mapped on (e,e)∈  ×  , which extends to more than two factors.

There is a unique [formula] being an anti-atom of [formula] but no anti-atom of [formula], [formula] if we assume k = q. Applying axiom [\ref=EC4] to d and 1 yields a dense element d1 such that d < d1 < 1. Observe that for all dense anti-atoms d' of [formula] we have [formula] since d' < d1 together with d < d1 would imply d1 = 1. There is a dense element [formula] such that [formula]. If we define [formula] then the map h1:S1  →  T defined by is an embedding over S.

To extend [formula] in [formula] appropriately we exploit that [formula] satisfies [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4]. [formula] can be extended in [formula] to a subalgebra [formula]. Therefore there is a maximal dense element d2∈S2 such that [formula]. For [formula] we have [formula] and that there is an embedding h3:S3  →  T extending h1.

Let a be the least element of [formula] such that [formula]. Then [formula], where [formula]. Applying axiom [\ref=EC5] to d1 and a yields a dense element [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, if [formula] then the map h:S1  →  T defined by is an embedding over S. As [formula] satisfies [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] [formula] can be extended in [formula] to a subalgebra [formula]. There is a maximal dense element [formula]. For [formula] we have [formula] and that there is an embedding h3:S3  →  T extending h1.

Thus in both subcases there is a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] extending [formula] such that [formula] and an embedding h3:S3  →  T over S.

In the first subcase there are two maximal dense elements [formula]. Again proceeding as in the proof of [\cite=RAS] applying axiom [\ref=AC3] yields elements k1 and k2 such that [formula]. There one defines [formula], from which here ki = ai is implied by c0 = 1 (i = 1,2).

The homomorphism h4:S4  →  T extending h3 by [formula] and [formula] is an embedding. As h3 is over S so is h4.

In the second subcase there is by the construction of [formula] a unique maximal dense element [formula]. Again proceeding as in the proof of [\cite=RAS] we find a skeletal element kd∈P such that [formula]. Therefore, the homomorphism h4:S4  →  T extending h4 by [formula] is an embedding. As h3 is over S so is h4.

Finally, we come to [formula]. If not [formula] we apply appropriately to obtain an extension [formula] congruent to [formula] and an isomorphism h:S'  →  T extending h4.

There are uniquely determined [formula], d an anti-atom, and [formula] such that b1 < d and b1 is an anti-atom of [formula] but no anti-atom of [formula]. Applying [\ref=AC4] to b1 and d yields a skeletal element b2 such that b1 < b2 < d and [formula]. Putting [formula] we obtain as for [\eqref=eq_my_contr]

[formula]

whose right hand side is isomorphic to [formula] and thus to [formula]. Therefore there is a skeletal anti-atom [formula] such that b1  <   < d and [formula].

Now there is according to ([\ref=eq_my_contr2]) a unique isomorphism h:S'  →  T over S defined by [formula].

We first consider the case p = 0 and assume q > 0, that is [formula]. Again we may assume [formula], [formula], identifying the subalgebra [formula] of [formula] with the direct product [formula] is isomorphic to. There is an atom ai,j of [formula], [formula] and [formula], such that

[formula]

We may assume i = q. For [formula] we have [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. We obtain

[formula]

as follows: From [\eqref=eq_dir_prod_sa_3] it follows

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that [formula] and π0(x) = 1. There is [formula] such that [formula]. For t: = x*  * due to [\eqref=eq_dir_prod_sa_3], as [formula] follows from [formula], we have π0(t) = 1 and [formula]. For u∈T such that π0(u) = 0 and πk(u) = πk(t) for [formula] we have [formula] according to [\eqref=eq_dir_prod_sa_3]. Setting s = u* we obtain [formula], thus [formula] sucht that s∈S and π0(s) = 1. Similarly one shows that for [formula] such that πi(x)  ≥  aq,j and π0(x) = 0 there is [formula] sucht that π0(s) = 1 and [formula] such that [formula]. Obviously, the right hand side of [\eqref=eq_char_T] is a disjoint union.

Now we are going to show that there is a skeletal element b∈P that behaves with respect to [formula] in the same way as [formula].

In order to express what this means, we define am∈S to be the maximal central element below the maximal dense element dm, 1  ≤  m  ≤  q. Therefore, πk(dm) = e if and only if m = k, and

[formula]

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Define [formula] and let b be the result of applying [\ref=EC2] to aq, s0 and dq. Then [\eqref=eq_char_new_sk1] and [\eqref=eq_char_new_sk2] are satisfied if [formula] is substituted by b: [\eqref=eq_char_new_sk1] follows from [formula]. b satisfies [\eqref=eq_char_new_sk2], as b is obtained by applying [\ref=EC2] to aq, s0 and dq. We additionally have

[formula]

Now we show that for [formula] there is an isomorphism h:T  →  S' over S with [formula]. We first describe S', the carrier set of [formula]:

[formula]

That rhs[\eqref=eq_char_S'] is contained in S' and that rhs[\eqref=eq_char_S'] contains [formula] is obvious. For the converse we have to show that rhs[\eqref=eq_char_S'] is closed under the operations. We consider the cases that are not obvious. In the sequel we assume [formula] and [formula] with π0(s) = 1.

[formula]

and similarly [formula].

[formula]

with [formula].

[formula]

Finally, we look at x∈S and show that [formula] and [formula] are also contained in rhs[\eqref=eq_char_S']. First we consider [formula]. If π0(x) = 1 then [formula] is contained in rhs[\eqref=eq_char_S'] since [formula]. If π0(x) = 0 then [formula]. Next we consider [formula]. There is [formula] with [formula]. First we assume π0(x) = 0, which implies [formula].

[formula]

Now let π0(x) = 1.

[formula]

Note that aq is the only maximal central element of [formula] that is not a maximal skeletal element of [formula] anymore. In [formula] we have [formula].

As rhs[\eqref=eq_char_T] is a disjoint union

[formula]

is well-defined. Obviously, h is over S. [\eqref=eq_char_S'] implies that h is onto S'.

It remains to show that for all u,v∈T

[formula]

[formula]

hold and that h is injective.

For [\eqref=hom_inf] we consider, assuming π0(su) = π0(sv) = 1, the following cases:

[formula], [formula].

[formula]

[formula], [formula].

[formula]

u∈S, [formula] with π0(s) = 1. We consider two subcases:

π0(u) = 1. Then [formula], thus

[formula]

π0(u) = 0.

[formula]

u∈S, [formula] with π0(s) = 1. There is [formula] such that [formula]. We consider again two subcases:

π0(u) = 1. Then [formula], thus

[formula]

π0(u) = 0:

[formula]

For [\eqref=hom_compl] we consider, assuming π0(s) = 1, the following cases:

[formula]:

[formula]

[formula]:

[formula]

To show the injectivity of h assume x,y∈T with [formula]. If x,y∈S then [formula] trivially holds. We consider the following non-trivial cases:

x∈S, [formula]. We consider the following subcases:

[formula], π0(x) = 0. Then h(x) = h(y) is impossible:

[formula]

But as π0(x) = 0 and π0(sy) = 1 we have [formula], πq(sy)  ≥  aq,j, contradicting the preceding equality.

[formula], π0(x) = 1. Then h(x) = h(y) again implies [formula] from which we obtain x*  *  ≤  b. Furthermore, x* < b from [\eqref=eq_new_elem_c0] since π0(x*) = 0. The last two inequalities imply b = 1 contradicting the choice of b.

[formula], π0(x) = 0. h(x) = h(y) is impossible: Similarly to the preceding subcase we obtain x*  ≤  b. But [\eqref=eq_new_elem_c0] and π0(x) = 0 imply x  ≤  b. Together we obtain b = 1 again contradicting the choice of b.

[formula], π0(x) = 1. h(x) = h(y) is impossible:

[formula]

But the last equation contradicts [formula], πq(y)  ≥  aq,j.

[formula]. We consider the following subcases:

[formula], [formula]. Then h(x) = h(y) implies [formula]. As π0(s*x) = π0(s*y) = 0 [\eqref=eq_new_elem_c0] implies s*x,s*y < b, thus b*  ≤  sx,sy, from which we obtain [formula]. It follows sx = sy.

[formula] is not possible: Because of π0() = 0 there is, setting s = sx = sy, [formula] such that πm(dx) = e and πm(dy) = 1, which is equivalent to [formula]. In the case m < q we have a*m < b due to [\eqref=eq_char_new_sk1], thus [formula]. In the case m = q we have [formula], which is [\eqref=eq_char_new_sk2]. Furthermore, s  ≥  a*q as π0(s) = πq(s) = 1. We obtain [formula]. On the other hand because of dx  ≤  dq we have h(x)  ≤  dx  ≤  dq, again contradicting our assumption h(x) = h(y).

[formula], [formula]. As in the preceding subcase h(x) = h(y) implies [formula], again leading to a contradiction.

[formula], [formula]. Here h(x) = h(y) implies [formula], which is impossible.

We now consider the case p > 0 and assume again q > 0. Since p > 0 there is a unique anti-atom b1 of [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula] and b1 is not an anti-atom of [formula]. Applying [\ref=EC1] to b1 and 1 yields a skeletal element b2 sucht that b1 < b2 < 1. Since [formula] there is a skeletal anti-atom [formula] such that b1  <   < 1. Setting [formula] there is a unique isomorphism h:S'  →  T over S and h(b2) = :

This holds because b2 and [formula] satisfy the same equations with respect to [formula] as b1 and because there is a unique isomorphism [formula] over [formula], see Remark [\ref=remark_ec_ba].

A p-semilattice [formula] is existentially closed if and only if [formula] satisfies [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5].

The proof is split up in a necessity and a sufficiency part.

Necessity

The necessity of the axioms [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem_finite_ax_ac] because every existentially closed p-semilattice is algebraically closed.

For the necessity of the axioms [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5] we consider the following [formula]-sentences of [formula]:

φ1(b1,b2): [formula] with [formula] and b1 < b2,

φ2(b1,b2,d): [formula] with [formula], [formula] and b1  ≤  b2 < d < 1,

φ3: [formula],

φ4(d1,d2): [formula] with [formula] and d1 < d2,

φ5(b,d): [formula] with [formula]. Each of these sentences can be satisfied in some direct product [formula] with suitably many subdirectly irreducible factors [formula] and [formula].

Sufficiency

This part is an adaptation of the sufficiency part of the first part of the proof of [\cite=GeSc]. Let [formula] be a p-semilattice satisfying [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5]. We prove that [formula] is existentially closed by showing that for any extension [formula] of [formula], [formula] and [formula] arbitrary, there exist [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic over [formula]:

Every finite system of equations and negated equations with coefficients [formula] corresponds to a formula [formula], with φ a quantifier-free [formula]-formula. If [formula], say [formula], then there are [formula] such that by the above [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic over [formula]. We obtain [formula], thus [formula].

To simplify notation we define [formula] and [formula], where we may assume that S and T are carrier sets of subalgebras [formula] and [formula] of [formula] and [formula], respectively (otherwise consider [formula] and [formula]).

We may assume

[formula]

According to Theorem [\ref=theorem_finite_ax_ac] [formula] is algebraically closed since [formula] satisfies [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4]. Therefore, according to Theorem [\ref=theorem_ac_char], any finite subalgebra can be extended within [formula] first to a subalgebra [formula], thus to a subalgebra isomorphic to [formula] and some suitable [formula].

Furthermore, using subdirect representation,

[formula]

may be assumed for a suitable atomfree boolean algebra [formula] and a suitable index set I.

Let [formula] be the elements of S corresponding to the r + s (central) elements [formula] of [formula]. We have

[formula]

with [formula] still being of type ([\ref=eq_superpcs]). Furthermore,

[formula]

and [formula] still satisfies axioms [\ref=AC1]-[\ref=AC4] and [\ref=EC1]-[\ref=EC5] by Lemma [\ref=lemma_axioms_prod]. We also have, using ([\ref=eq_apprex]),

[formula]

[formula] as a direct product of algebraically closed factors and its quotients [formula] are algebraically closed according to [\cite=Sc3]. Therefore, as above for [formula],

[formula]

may be assumed.

Summing up, the preceding considerations yield: To show that for all [formula] and [formula] there are [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic over [formula], due to ([\ref=eq_factoring_Q])-([\ref=eq_v1_vm])

[formula]

with [formula],

[formula]

may be assumed. If t  ≥  1, then f(1)  ≥  t may be assumed.

If [formula] and [formula] then applying [\ref=EC1] yields that there is a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] and an isomorphism [formula] over S. If [formula] and [formula] contains a proper dense element, we first extend [formula] within [formula] to [formula] by applying [\ref=EC3]. Therefore we assume [formula], 1  ≤  l, 1  ≤  q and 1  ≤  f(i), 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, in the sequel.

According to Lemma [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext1] there is a sequence [formula] of subalgebras of [formula] with [formula] and [formula] such that for [formula] we have [formula], whereby

[formula]

[formula]

where we define [formula] as the 1-element p-semilattice. In contrast to Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case1] the first index of the sequence is 1 since [formula] has a proper dense element. In [\eqref=eq_suff_ext2] there is for every [formula] a sequence [formula] such that

[formula]

[formula]

where again empty products are defined to be the 1-element p-semilattice.

Finally, there is according to Lemma [\ref=lemma_stepwise_ext2] a sequence [formula] of subalgebras of [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula]

We set [formula]. According to Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext],[\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case1]. there existis for every [formula] a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] and an isomorphism hk + 1:Sk + 1  →  Tk + 1 extending hk, the sequence [formula] as in [\eqref=eq_suff_ext1].

According to Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext],[\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case2]. there exists for every [formula] and every [formula] a subalgebra [formula] and an isomorphism hk,j + 1:Sk,j + 1  →  Tk,j + 1 extending hk,j, and the sequences [formula] as in [\eqref=eq_suff_ext2a]. According to Lemma [\ref=lemma_spec_ext],[\ref=lemma_spec_ext_case3]. there exists for every [formula] a subalgebra [formula] of [formula] and an isomorphism [formula] extending h2q + j, the sequence [formula] as in [\eqref=eq_suff_ext3].

The above implies that h2q + p:S2q + p  →  T is the desired isomorphism over S since [formula] and every extension of h1 is over S.
