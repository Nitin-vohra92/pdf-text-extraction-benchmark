Interacting tachyon Fermi gas

Introduction

Tachyon is a substance whose group velocity is larger than the speed of light in vacuum c = 1. Tachyons are commonly known in the field theory [\cite=C1] and nonlinear optics [\cite=O1]. A free fermionic tachyon is described by the Lagrangian [\cite=D1] [\cite=D2]

[formula]

corresponding to the tachyonic Dirac equation (iγμ∂μ  -  γ5m)ψ = 0 that has plane-wave solution in the form

[formula]

with a single-particle tachyon energy

[formula]

Much more complicated theory is developed for tachyons in external fields [\cite=Da98] [\cite=K2011]. If a charged Dirac tachyon interacts with electromagnetic field Aμ, the Lagrangian is presented in the form [\cite=D3]

[formula]

where Dμ  =  ∂μ + iAμ. Dirac tachyons with nonlinear self-interaction were also considered [\cite=O2011]. However a system of many interacting tachyons has not been discussed yet.

In the present paper we consider the tachyonic Lagrangian

[formula]

that includes interaction with scalar field s, pseudoscalar field Π, massive vector field ωμ (relevant Maxwell tensor is Gμν  =  ∂μων  -  ∂νωμ) and massive electromagnetic field Aμ (Fμν  =  ∂μAν  -  ∂νAμ). Each interaction vertex in ([\ref=la]) is taken in the form of Yukawa minimal coupling while the coupling constants are included in the fields for simplicity. Our interest concerns the single-particle energy spectrum and a the thermodynamical functions of many tachyon system in the frames of the mean-field approach. The interaction may result in a field condensate with non-zero vacuum expectation value responsible for qualitatively new properties in contrast to a free tachyon Fermi gas.

Tachyonic energy spectrum

Starting with the Lagrangian ([\ref=la]), we write the equation of motion for the Dirac tachyon

[formula]

and Klein-Gordon equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for the fields s, Π, ωμ and Aμ, where the tachyons are acting as sources.

Looking for solution of equation ([\ref=dir]) in the form of plane wave ([\ref=wa] we come to a linear system for bispinors

[formula]

It has solution if the energy satisfies dispersion relation

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the effective mass. Indeed, switching off all interactions, we obtain from ([\ref=ea]) the energy spectrum of a free tachyon ([\ref=tah]).

Taking into account the properties of the Dirac matrices γμ and operator [formula], we find that the energy spectrum ([\ref=ea]) at ωμ = 0 is reduced to

[formula]

where the coupling constant e is written explicitly so that expression ([\ref=el]) is looking like well known energy spectrum in electrodynamics and nuclear physics [\cite=KaM] where potential Aμ is acting as an ordinary electromagnetic or vector-meson filed, while the scalar field s and pseudoscalar field Π are responsible for the effective mass [\ref=em].

When the vector field ωμ  ≠  0 is switched on, an absolutely different tachyonic energy spectrum is obtained:

[formula]

Here we omit for simplicity all other fields (s, Π, Aμ) and write the coupling constant g explicitly. There is not only dependence on the spin (note that [formula] is acting as a regular magnetic field applied to an ordinary non-tachyon particle) there is also explicit dependence on the helicty of the particle.

For uniform electro-static potential [formula] (and [formula]) formula ([\ref=ew]) is reduced to

[formula]

where h = 1 for right-handed and h =  - 1 left-handed tachyons, respectively. The energy ([\ref=ew2]) of right-handed tachyons is imaginary at any p if

[formula]

The energy ([\ref=ew2]) of left-handed tachyons is imaginary at any p if

[formula]

The group velocity

[formula]

is subluminal at any p if

[formula]

Mean field approach to many-tachyon system

Now consider a many-tachyon system with interaction described by the Lagrangian ([\ref=la]) and enclosed in volume [formula]. A charge Q, associated with the relevant Noether current, is incorporated in the partition function [\cite=KaM]

[formula]

where τ = it, and μ is the tachyonic chemical potential. The tachyonic equation of motion ([\ref=dir]) results in the continuity equation ∂μ  jμ5 = 0 for the axial current jμ5  =  γμγ5ψ that corresponds to the conserved axial charge [formula], while the vector current jμ  =  γμψ is not conserved because [\cite=T89] ∂μ  jμ =  - 2imγ5ψ. Hence, the axial charge is incorporated in the partition function ([\ref=z]) rather than the number of particles (which is not conserved). Thus, the tachyonic pressure

[formula]

the energy density

[formula]

and the entropy density

[formula]

include the axial charge density

[formula]

rather than ordinary particle number density.

Let us apply the mean field approximation [\cite=KaM], neglecting quantum field fluctuations. The tachyons are taken to move independently in the presence of constant mean fields [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] which themselves are generated self-consistently according to equations ([\ref=ss])-([\ref=aa]), namely:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The argument of partition function ([\ref=z]) is

[formula]

where [formula] is the Lagrangian of tachyons and

[formula]

is the Lagrangian of the mean fields. It allows to present the partition function ([\ref=z]) as a product [formula] that includes contribution of the tachyons [formula] and contribution of the mean fields [formula]. Thus, we determine the pressure

[formula]

and the energy density

[formula]

where [\cite=TV2011c] [\cite=T2012b]

[formula]

is the pressure, while

[formula]

is the energy density and

[formula]

is the axial charge density of a free tachyon Fermi gas with distribution function

[formula]

and single-particle energy spectrum [formula] determined in the frames of mean-field approximation by substituting the mean fields [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] in ([\ref=ea]).

Vector and pseudovector condensates

Let us consider tachyons with pure vector and pseudovector interaction ωμ and Aμ. For a rotational symmetric uniform matter we take [formula], [formula] and [formula] so that equations ([\ref=aa1]) and ([\ref=oo1]) yield

[formula]

[formula]

where, again, the coupling constants g and e are written explicitely, and

[formula]

is the axial charge density, while

[formula]

is the particle number density (and the coupling constants g and e are written explicitly).

Thus, the vector and pseudovector fields acquires finite condensed values Ã0 and 0 which depends on n. Substituting 0 ([\ref=o1]) in ([\ref=ew]) we find the mean-field energy spectrum of tachyons

[formula]

Defining effective single-particle energy

[formula]

together with effective chemical potential

[formula]

and taking into account that the distribution function ([\ref=f]) can be presented in the form

[formula]

we calculate the pressure ([\ref=pp]) and energy density ([\ref=ee]) so

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the energy density of free particles with energy spectrum ε* p ([\ref=o33a]) and chemical potential ([\ref=o33b]).

The single-particle energy ([\ref=o33a]) is given in Fig. [\ref=Fv1] for right-handed and left-handed tachyons. The single-particle energy ([\ref=o33a] of right-handed tachyons (h = 1) is always real at any p when

[formula]

while the single-particle energy of left-handed tachyons (h =  - 1) is always real at any p when

[formula]

Thus, the pressure ([\ref=pp]), ([\ref=pp9]) and energy density ([\ref=ee]), ([\ref=ee9]) acquire no imaginary content if the particle number density exceeds critical threshold n+ ([\ref=o4]) or n- ([\ref=o5]).

The group velocity

[formula]

associated with energy-spectrum ([\ref=o33a]), is subluminal for both right-handed and left-handed tachyons when inequality ([\ref=o5]) is satisfied. This group velocity is plotted in Fig. [\ref=Fv2].

What is important for us is be noted than in the limit m  →  0 the energy spectrum () is

[formula]

and the group velocity () is helicity dependendt

[formula]

and It is given in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Omega is incuded in the mass matrix, so that the vector condnensate results in the mass generation.

Conclusion

The energy dispersion relation ([\ref=ea]) of a tachyon coupled to the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and pseudovector (electromagnetic) fields reveal the nature of interaction. The scalar and pseudoscalar potentials field contribute to the only effective mass ([\ref=em]). The potential is acting as a regular electromagnetic field on the ordinary Dirac particle. The most interesting behavior belongs to the vector field, whose sole action results in very peculiar energy spectrum ([\ref=ew]) including dependence not only on the spin but also on the helicity of the tachyon.

Working in the frames of mean-field approximation, we find that the single-particle energy ([\ref=o33]), (Fig. [\ref=Fv1]) is real under conditions ([\ref=o4])-([\ref=o5]) that imply that the pressure ([\ref=pp9]) and energy density ([\ref=ee9]) are also real like that of an ordinary Fermi gas. This means that interaction results in stabilization of the tachyon matter, and weak coupling (g  →  0) can provide stability to the dense matter, while strong coupling (g  →    ∞  ) is enough for stabilization of rarefied matter. It should be also noted that the group velocity ([\ref=o6]) becomes subluminal in dense tachyon Fermi gas, see Fig. [\ref=Fv2], although right-handed and left-handed tachyons reveal very different behavior: for example, left handed tachyons may have negative group velocity like the optical tachyons in nonlinear medium [\cite=O1], and subluminal right-handed tachyons are faster than left-handed tachyons at the same momentum.

The present analysis may give further ideas for solving applied problems. For example, we have all necessary theoretical background ([\ref=bi])-([\ref=ea] ([\ref=z]) to consider superconductivity of interacting tachyon Fermi system and find the relevant excitation spectrum. It should be emphasized that conditions ([\ref=o4])-([\ref=o5]) do not warrant automatically the causality condition [\cite=TV2011c], which may impose further requirements to the particle number density. According to ([\ref=ee9]) the vector and pseudovector (electromagnetic) interaction bring different repulsive-attractive effects to the many-particle system, and formulas ([\ref=pp][\ref=f]), ([\ref=o33])-([\ref=e9]) are can be applied to calculation of the binding energy of tachyon matter and finding the point of gas-liquid phase transition. Solving such problems, one should be careful with expression of the Fermi momentum, bearing in mind the important fact that formulas ([\ref=o33])-([\ref=o6]) are written with the particle number density [formula], while the partition function of a free tachyon Fermi gas must include the axial charge density [formula].
