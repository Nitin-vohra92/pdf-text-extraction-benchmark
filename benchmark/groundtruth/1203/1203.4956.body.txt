Approximations of Subhomogeneous Algebras

Introduction

Let A and B be C*-algebras and let φ:A  →  B be a bounded linear map. For each integer n  ≥  1, we can define maps

[formula]

where [formula] denote the C*-algebra of n  ×  n-matrices. We say that φ is n-positive if [formula] is positive and n-contractive if [formula] is contractive. We say that a map is completely positive (completely contractive) if it is n-positive (n-contractive) for all n  ≥  1. As usual, we abbreviate completely positive by c.p., contractive and completely positive by c.c.p., unital and completely positive by u.c.p. and completely contractive by c.c. Note that u.c.p. maps are c.c.p. and c.c.p. maps are c.c. by the Stinespring dilation theorem [\cite=MR0069403].

Finite-dimensional approximation properties of maps and C*-algebras play an important role in the study of C*-algebras. See [\cite=MR2391387] for a comprehensive treatment.

A c.c.p. map θ:A  →  B is said to be nuclear if there exist finite-dimensional C*-algebras Fα and nets of c.c.p. maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  B such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

A C*-algebra A is said to be nuclear if the identity map [formula] is nuclear and exact if there exists a faithful representation π:A  →  B(H) which is nuclear.

The following is the standard example.

Let Γ be a countable discrete group. Then the reduced group C*-algebra C*λ(Γ) is nuclear if and only if Γ is amenable. In particular, the reduced group C*-algebra C*λ(F2) of a free group on two generators is non-nuclear. See [\cite=MR2391387].

It is well known that a C*-algebra is nuclear if and only if the identity map is a point-norm limit of finite-rank c.c.p. maps. On the other hand, it was shown by De Cannière and Haagerup that the identity map on C*λ(F2) is a point-norm limit of finite-rank c.c. maps (cf.  [\cite=MR784292]). This is in contrast to the following theorem of Smith, which says that we recover nuclearity if we insist that the finite-rank c.c. maps to factor through finite-dimensional C*-algebras.

A C*-algebra A is nuclear if and only if there exist finite-dimensional C*-algebras Fα and nets of c.c. maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

All abelian C*-algebras are nuclear. In fact, the standard proof based on partition of unities shows that one can take the finite-dimensional C*-algebras Fα's to be abelian and c.c.p. maps φα's to be *  -homomorphisms (cf. [\cite=MR2391387]).

Our investigation grew out of the following simple question.

Not surprisingly, the answer is YES. In this paper we prove the following.

Let n  ≥  1. Recall that a C*-algebra is said to be if all its irreducible representations have dimension ≤  n. Clearly, a C*-algebra is abelian if and only if it is 1-subhomogeneous. A finite-dimensional C*-algebra is n-subhomogeneous if and only if it is a finite product of matrix algebras [formula] of size k  ≤  n.

Let A be a C*-algebra and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. Then the following are equivalent.

The C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous.

There exist nets of *  -homomorphisms φα:A  →  Fα and c.c.p. maps ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite dimensional and n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

There exist nets of c.c.p. maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα (finite dimensional and) n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

There exist nets of c.c. maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα (finite dimensional and) n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

The nontrivial implications are ([\ref=it_main_nsub]) ⇒   ([\ref=it_main_hom]), ([\ref=it_main_ccp]) ⇒   ([\ref=it_main_nsub]) and ([\ref=it_main_cc]) ⇒   ([\ref=it_main_nsub]). See Theorem [\ref=thm_intr_2] below.

Our proof is based on the solution of the Choi conjecture [\cite=MR0315460], due to Tomiyama [\cite=MR680854] and Smith [\cite=MR686514], and a contractive analogue of the Choi conjecture (see Theorem [\ref=thm_choi_c]). See also [\cite=MR0397423] and [\cite=MR715564].

The following is a summary of the results.

Let A be a C*-algebra and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. Then the following are equivalent.

The C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous.

There exist nets of *  -homomorphisms φα:A  →  Fα and c.c.p. maps ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite dimensional and n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

There exist nets of n-positive maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite dimensional and n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

All n-positive maps with domain and/or range A are completely positive.

There exist nets of n-contractive maps φα:A  →  Fα and (n + 1)-contractive maps ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite dimensional and n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

All n-contractive maps with range A are completely contractive.

See Theorems [\ref=thm_app], [\ref=thm_sub] and [\ref=thm_sub-contr].

In section [\ref=sec_ab], we show that even weaker approximation property characterises abelianness. See Theorem [\ref=thm_takesaki_proof].

Subhomogeneous Algebras

Let n  ≥  1 be an integer.

We say that a C*-algebra is if all its irreducible representations have dimension ≤  n.

A finite-dimensional C*-algebra is n-subhomogeneous if and only if it is a finite product of matrix algebras [formula] with k  ≤  n.

In the following, we summarise some well-known properties of n-subhomogeneous C*-algebras. See also [\cite=MR2188261].

Let n  ≥  1 be an integer. The following statements hold.

A C*-subalgebra of a n-subhomogeneous algebra is n-subhomogeneous.

A C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous if and only if [formula] for some abelian C*-algebra B.

A C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous if and only if its bidual A*  * is n-subhomogeneous as a C*-algebra.

The product/sum of C*-algebras Ai, i∈I, is n-subhomogeneous if and only if each Ai, i∈I, is n-subhomogeneous.

Let 0  →  I  →  A  →  B  →  0 be an extension of C*-algebras. Then A is n-subhomogeneous if and only if I and B are n-subhomogeneous.

Follows from [\cite=MR548006].

If A is n-subhomogeneous, then [formula], where Â denote the set of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible representations of A. The other direction follows from ([\ref=i_subalg]).

Since A  ⊆  A*  *, if A*  * is n-subhomogeneous, then so is A by ([\ref=i_subalg]). Conversely, if A is n-subhomogeneous, then writing [formula] with B abelian using ([\ref=i_ab]), we see that [formula]. We are done by ([\ref=i_ab]), since B*  * is abelian.

Follows from ([\ref=i_ab]).

Follows from ([\ref=i_dd]) and ([\ref=i_prod]), since [formula].

The structure of n-subhomogeneous C*-algebras can be rather complicated (see for instance [\cite=MR0139025]). However, the situation for von Neumann algebras is well-known to be very simple.

Suppose that a von Neumann algebra M is n-subhomogeneous as a C*-algebra. Then

[formula]

where Bk, k  ≤  n, are abelian von Neumann algebras.

Since exactness passes to C*-subalgebras, n-subhomogeneous algebras are exact by Proposition [\ref=prop_subhom]([\ref=i_ab]). Now [\cite=MR2391387] completes the proof.

Subhomogeneous algebras are type I, hence nuclear (cf. [\cite=MR2391387]). Scrutinizing the proof, we see that the following slightly stronger approximation property holds. We consider the unital case first.

Let n  ≥  1 and let A be a unital n-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. Then there exist finite-dimensional n-subhomogeneous C*-algebras Fα and nets of unital *  -homomorphisms φα:A  →  Fα and u.c.p. maps ψα:Fα  →  A such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

Let A and B be unital C*-algebras. We say a u.c.p. map θ:A  →  B is n-factorable if it can be expressed as a composition [formula], where φ:A  →  F is a unital *  -homomorphism and ψ:F  →  B a u.c.p. map and F a finite-dimensional n-subhomogeneous C*-algebra.

For any unital C*-algebras A and B, the set of n-factorable maps A  →  B is convex.

The proof of [\cite=MR2391387] applies.

Let F be a finite-dimensional C*-algebra and let A be a unital C*-algebra. Then u.c.p. maps F  →  A*  * can be approximated by u.c.p. maps F  →  A in the point-ultraweak topology.

We claim that c.p. maps F  →  A correspond bijectively to positive elements in [formula]. Indeed, for matrix algebras this is a well-known result of Arveson (cf. [\cite=MR2391387]). The general case follows, since F is a finite product of matrix algebras and for c.p. maps finite products and finite coproducts coincide. Since positive elements in [formula] is ultraweakly dense in the positive elements in [formula], we see that c.p. maps F  →  A*  * can be approximated by c.p. maps F  →  A in the point-ultraweak topology.

Let ψ:F  →  A*  * be a u.c.p. map and let ψλ:F  →  A be a net of c.p. maps converging to ψ in the point-ultraweak topology. Since ψλ(1F)∈A is a net converging to 1A weakly, by passing to convex linear combinations, we may assume that ψλ(1F) converges to 1A in norm and passing to a subnet we may assume that ψλ(1F) is invertible. Then [formula], x∈F, gives the required approximation.

For n  =  1 and A unital abelian, the claim follows from the classical proof of nuclearity for abelian algebras (cf. [\cite=MR2391387]).

For general n, first assume that A is of the form

[formula]

where Ak, k  ≤  n, are unital abelian C*-algebras. Then the claim is easily deduced from the case n  =  1.

Now we consider a general n-subhomogeneous A. By Proposition [\ref=prop_subhom]([\ref=i_dd]) and Lemma [\ref=lem_vN], the bidual A*  * is of the form ([\ref=i_elementary]), hence [formula] can be approximated by n-factorable maps A*  *  →  A*  * in point-norm topology. Then by Lemma [\ref=lem_app], [formula] can be approximated by n-factorable maps in point-weak topology. Now Lemma [\ref=lem_convex] and [\cite=MR2391387] completes the proof.

As a corollary we obtain the following.

Let A be a C*-algebra and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. Then A is n-subhomogeneous if and only if there exist nets of *  -homomorphisms φα:A  →  Fα and c.c.p. maps ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite-dimensional n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

(⇒  ) The unitization A+ is n-subhomogeneous, hence [formula] can be approximated as in Theorem [\ref=thm_app_unital]. Now restrict φα to A and replace ψα by eβψαeβ, where eβ is an approximate unit in A (cf. [\cite=MR2391387]).

(⇐) Clearly A is a C*-subalgebra of [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop_subhom]([\ref=i_prod] & [\ref=i_subalg]), A is n-subhomogeneous.

It turns out that much weaker approximation properties imply n-subhomogeneity. Our first result depends on the following.

Let A and B be C*-algebras and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. Then all n-positive maps A  →  B are completely positive if and only if A or B is n-subhomogeneous.

Choi proved the sufficiency (⇐) for [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR0315460]) and [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR0315460]) with D abelian and conjectured the necessity (⇒  ). A complete proof is obtained by Tomiyama (cf. [\cite=MR680854]). The necessity was also proved by Smith (cf. [\cite=MR686514]).

Let A be a C*-algebra and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. Then the following are equivalent.

There exist nets of n-positive maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite-dimensional n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

All n-positive maps with domain A are completely positive.

All n-positive maps with range A are completely positive.

All n-positive maps A  →  A are completely positive.

The C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous.

Let φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A be a n-positive approximation of [formula] in point-norm topology, with Fα (finite-dimensional) n-subhomogeneous. Let θ:A  →  B be a n-positive map. Then [formula] is a n-positive map with n-subhomogeneous domain, hence c.p. map by Theorem [\ref=thm_choi] and φα:A  →  Fα is a n-positive map with n-subhomogeneous range, hence also c.p. Since θ is the point-norm limit of [formula], we see that θ is c.p. Hence ([\ref=item_app]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_domain]). Similarly ([\ref=item_app]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_range]).

The implications ([\ref=item_domain]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_dom-range]) and ([\ref=item_range]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_dom-range]) are clear and the implication ([\ref=item_dom-range]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_repn]) is immediate from Theorem [\ref=thm_choi]. Finally, the implication ([\ref=item_repn]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_app]) follows from Theorem [\ref=thm_app].

The sufficiency in Theorem [\ref=thm_choi] can be deduced from the cases [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR0315460]) and [formula] (cf. [\cite=MR0315460]) using Theorem [\ref=thm_sub].

Now we consider the contractive analogue.

Let [formula], n  ≥  1, denote the transpose map and let m  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

For n  ≤  m, this is well-known. The general case follows from the identity

[formula]

since [formula] can be identified with τnm, hence an isometry.

Let n  ≥  2 be an integer. Then the map

[formula]

is (n - 1)-contractive, but not n-contractive.

As a corollary, we obtain the following contractive analogue of Theorem [\ref=thm_choi]. Note that we have only one of the directions (cf. [\cite=MR0397423]).

Let A and B be C*-algebras and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. If A and B both admit irreducible representations of dimension ≥  (n + 1), then there exists an n-contractive map A  →  B which is not (n + 1)-contractive.

The proof of [\cite=MR686514] applies. See also [\cite=MR680854]

Let A be a C*-algebra and let n  ≥  1 be an integer. Then the following are equivalent.

There exist nets of n-contractive maps φα:A  →  Fα and (n + 1)-contractive maps ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα finite-dimensional n-subhomogeneous, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

All n-contractive maps with range A are (n + 1)-contractive.

All n-contractive maps with range A are completely contractive.

All n-contractive maps A  →  A are (n + 1)-contractive.

All n-contractive maps A  →  A are completely contractive.

The C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous.

We prove the implications

[formula]

The implications ([\ref=item_range_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_dom-range_c]), ([\ref=item_dom-range_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_dom-range_+]) and ([\ref=item_range_+]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_dom-range_+]) are clear. The implication ([\ref=item_dom-range_+]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_repn_c]) follows from Theorem [\ref=thm_choi_c] and the implication ([\ref=item_repn_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_app_c]) follows from Theorem [\ref=thm_app]. The implication ([\ref=item_repn_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_range_c]) follows from [\cite=MR686514]. Since ([\ref=item_range_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_range_+]) is clear, we also have ([\ref=item_repn_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_range_+]).

Finally, the implication ([\ref=item_app_c]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_range_+]) is analogous to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_sub](([\ref=item_app]) ⇒   ([\ref=item_range])).

Compare with the Loebl conjecture [\cite=MR0397423], solved affirmatively by Huruya-Tomiyama [\cite=MR715564] and Smith [\cite=MR686514].

Note that the statement

All n-contractive maps with domain A are (n + 1)-contractive.

is not equivalent to the conditions in Theorem [\ref=thm_sub-contr] in general (cf. [\cite=MR0397423]).

The Abelian Case

Specialising to n  =  1 in Theorem [\ref=thm_sub], we obtain the following.

Let A be a C*-algebra. Suppose that there exist nets of contractive positive maps φα:A  →  Fα and ψα:Fα  →  A, with Fα abelian, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

Then A is abelian.

We give an alternative proof.

First note that φα and ψα are c.c.p. (cf. [\cite=MR0069403]).

Unitizing if necessary, we may assume that A is unital. Let [formula] denote the opposite algebra of A. Then the canonical map [formula] is a pointwise limit of c.c.p. maps [formula], hence a c.c.p. map. Moreover, since ι sends unitaries to unitaries, its multiplicative domain is the whole of A. It follows that ι is a *  -homomorphism and A is abelian.

In fact, the following is true.

Let θ:A  →  B be an injective *  -homomorphism. Suppose that there exist nets of contractive maps φα:A  →  Fα and 2-contractive maps ψα:Fα  →  B, with Fα abelian, such that for all x∈A,

[formula]

Then A is abelian.

Our main tool is the following beautiful theorem of Takesaki. Let A1 and A2 be C*-algebras. The injective cross-norm of A1 and A2 is defined by

[formula]

where φ1 and φ2 run over all contractive linear functionals of A1 and A2, respectively. The injective C*-cross-norm of A1 and A2 is defined by

[formula]

where π1 and π2 run over all unitary representations of A1 and A2, respectively.

Note that we always have ||  ·  ||λ  ≤  ||  ·  ||min (cf. [\cite=MR1873025]).

Let A1 and A2 be C*-algebras. Then the norms ||  ·  ||min and ||  ·  ||λ on [formula] are equal if and only if A1 or A2 is abelian.

Equipped with Takesaki's theorem, we can now mimic the proof that nuclear C*-algebras are tensor-nuclear (cf. [\cite=MR2391387]).

We show that for any [formula], we have ||x||min  ≤  ||x||λ. Then Theorem [\ref=thm_takesaki] completes the proof.

Let [formula]. The map

[formula]

is an injective *  -homomorphism, hence an isometry. Thus

[formula]

Writing x as the sum of elementary tensors, we see that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

On the other hand, it follows from the assumptions that the maps

[formula]

are contractions and since Fα is abelian, the canonical map

[formula]

is an isometry by Theorem [\ref=thm_takesaki]. Hence, we have

[formula]

It follows that ||x||min  ≤  ||x||λ.
