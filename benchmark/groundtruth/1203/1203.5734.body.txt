ABSTRACT

We investigate the streaming and thermal instabilities of the electron-ion plasma with homogeneous cold cosmic rays drifting perpendicular to the background magnetic field in the multi-fluid approach. One-dimensional perturbations along the magnetic field are considered. The induced return current of the background plasma and back-reaction of cosmic rays are taken into account. It is shown that the cosmic ray back-reaction results in the streaming instability having considerably larger growth rates than that due to the return current of the background plasma. This increase is by a factor of the square root of the ratio of the background plasma mass density to the cosmic ray mass density. The maximal growth rates and corresponding wave numbers are found. The thermal instability is shown to be not subject to the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relation for the thermal instability includes ion inertia. In the limit of fast thermal energy exchange between electrons and ions, the isobaric and isochoric growth rates are derived. The results obtained can be useful for the investigation of the electron-ion astrophysical objects such as galaxy clusters including the dynamics of streaming cosmic rays.

INTRODUCTION

There is a growing interest towards understanding of interactions of cosmic rays with plasma systems in astrophysics and their possible effects. Irrespective of various mechanisms which are proposed for the generation of such high energy particles, cosmic rays may interact with the existing turbulent motions in a plasma or even may excite them. In order to study cosmic rays, a particle description is needed, although the fluid approximation is used as well for simplicity. Cosmic rays may further induce ionization which may dramatically change the physical properties of a system. For example, the ionization by cosmic rays has a vital role in star formation near the Galactic center (e.g., Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007) or in the dead zone of protoplanetary disks (Gammie 1996). On the other hand, the heating rate is enhanced because of cosmic rays and this important effect has been studied in the context of structure formation in the interstellar medium (ISM) via thermal instability (e.g., Goldsmith et al. 1969; Field et al. 1969).

Another contribution of cosmic rays to the dynamical evolution of the system is their pressure. Many authors studied the dynamical role of cosmic rays in structure formation at large scales by Parker instability (Parker 1966; Kuwabara & Ko 2006), magnetorotational instability (Khajenabi 2012) and even galactic winds or outflows (e.g., Everett et al. 2008). Recently, Wagner et al. (2005) and Shadmehri (2009) extended the classical thermal instability (Field 1965) to include cosmic rays. The thermal instability has been used to explain existence of structures not only in the ISM but also at the very large scales like in the intracluster medium (ICM). This instability is assumed as a possible mechanism for producing molecular filaments (Sharma et al. 2010) seen in galaxy clusters with short ([formula]1 Gyr) cooling times (e.g., Conselice et al. 2001; Salomé et al. 2006; Cavagnolo et al. 2008; O'Dea et al. 2008). Recent linear analysis of thermal instability with cosmic ray pressure shows that the instability is suppressed (e.g., Shadmehri 2009). Cosmic rays has been included by Shadmehri (2009) (see also Sharma et al. 2010) in the framework of the magnetohydrodynamic equations as a second fluid having the velocity of the thermal plasma. Numerical analysis shows that the cosmic ray pressure can play an important role in the dynamics of cold filaments making them much more elongated along the magnetic field lines than the Field length. This is consistent with observations as well (Sharma et al. 2010; see also Snodin et al. 2006). Also, including cosmic rays is required to explain the atomic and molecular lines observed in filaments in clusters of galaxies (Ferland et al. 2009).

However, there is another important effect of cosmic rays which has not been considered in the context of thermal instability, namely the presence of streaming cosmic rays. These particles are charged and their drift motion induces a current. It has been assumed that at some distance from the shock cosmic rays are mainly positively charged particles (Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009). The cosmic ray drift driving a constant current results in arising of the return current provided by the background plasma (e.g., Bell 2004, 2005; Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009). The possible role of this effect in the generation of thermal instability needs to be considered. There is also another important issue like the amplification of magnetic fields. The classical cyclotron resonant instability has been proposed long time ago to explain this process (Kulsrud & Pearce 1969). However, this mechanism has turned out to be unable to provide sufficient energy in the shock upstream plasma. In order to resolve this problem, just recently a new non-resonant instability has been introduced that may provide a much higher energy (Bell 2004). This instability, which is known as the Bell instability, has also been confirmed by non-linear numerical simulations (e.g., Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009). Subsequent works extended this instability into various directions by considering various physical factors (e.g., Reville et al. 2007; Reville & Bell 2012). However, all these works, except the paper by Bell (2005), have been restricted to the cosmic ray drift speed parallel to the initial magnetic field and correspondingly to unmagnetized cosmic rays, where Larmor radii of cosmic rays defined by longitudinal velocities are much larger than the length scale of interest (see also Zweibel 2003). In the case of magnetized cosmic rays, whose Larmor radii are smaller than the typical length scales of the system, the cosmic ray current can be perpendicular to the initial magnetic field as has been demonstrated by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010). Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) studied this perpendicular current-driven instability in the linear regime and also numerically and compared their growth rate with the cosmic ray current-driven instability (CRCD) by Bell (2004). The growth rates and length scales in both cases were similar. But the authors have not included the cosmic ray back-reaction analytically.

Depending on the magnetic field strength and the cosmic ray flux, the cosmic ray thermal pressure effect may become important and modify the maximum growth rate of the CRCD (for a detailed discussion, see Zweibel & Everett 2010). The thermal instability in galaxy clusters in the multi-fluid approach has been considered by Nekrasov (2011, 2012). The related effects by cosmic rays were not included in these papers. Here, we take into account streaming cold cosmic rays. We consider a geometry in which homogeneous cosmic rays drift across the background magnetic field and perturbations arise along the latter. Such a geometry is analogous to that treated by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010). However, we include the cosmic ray back-reaction. We also take into account the plasma return current (e.g., Bell 2004, 2005; Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009, 2010). For simplicity, we ignore the action of gravity here (Sharma et al. 2010). The effects of the gravitational field have been investigated in detail in multi-fluid approach in papers by Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2010, 2011). Thus, our present study extends previous analytical studies by considering not only the thermal effects but the currents driven by cosmic rays and their back-reaction.

The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 contains the fundamental equations for plasma, cosmic rays, and electromagnetic fields used in this paper. Equilibrium state is discussed in Section 3. In Sections 4 and 5, the perturbed velocities of the ions and electrons and perturbed plasma current are given, respectively. Corresponding results obtained for cosmic rays are contained in Sections 6 and 7. The total perturbed current is given in Section 8. Wave equations are found in Section 9. Dispersion relation including the plasma return current, cosmic ray back-reaction, and terms describing the thermal instability is derived in Section 10. In Section 11, a discussion of important results obtained is provided. Possible astrophysical implications are given in Section 12. Conclusive remarks are summarized in Section 13.

BASIC EQUATIONS FOR PLASMA AND COSMIC RAYS

The fundamental equations for a plasma that we consider here are the following:

[formula]

the equation of motion,

[formula]

the continuity equation,

[formula]

and

[formula]

are the temperature equations for ions and electrons. In Equations (1) and (2), the subscript j = i,e denotes the ions and electrons, respectively. Notations in Equations (1)-(4) are the following: qj and mj are the charge and mass of species j, [formula] is the hydrodynamic velocity, nj is the number density, pj = njTj is the thermal pressure, Tj is the temperature, νεie(ne,Te) ([formula]) is the frequency of thermal energy exchange between ions (electrons) and electrons (ions) being νεie(ne,Te) = 2νie, where νie is the collision frequency of ions with electrons (Braginskii 1965), [formula], γ is the ratio of the specific heats, [formula] and [formula] are the electric and magnetic fields, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Here, for simplicity, we do not take into account collisions between the ions and electrons in the momentum equation. This effect for the thermal instability has been treated by Nekrasov (2011, 2012), where, in particular, conditions allowing to neglect the collisions have been found. However, the thermal exchange should be included because its time scale compares with the dynamical time. The value [formula] in Equation (4) is the electron heat flux (Braginskii 1965). In a weakly collisional plasma, which is considered here, the electron Larmor radius is much smaller than the electron collisional mean free path. In this case, the electron thermal flux is mainly directed along the magnetic field,

[formula]

where χe is the electron thermal conductivity coefficient and [formula] is the unit vector along the magnetic field. We only take into account the electron thermal flux given by Equation (5) because the longitudinal ion thermal conductivity is considerably smaller (Braginskii 1965). We also assume that the thermal flux in the equilibrium is absent. The cooling and heating of plasma species in Equations (3) and (4) are described by function [formula], where Λj and Γj are the cooling and heating functions, respectively. The form of this function is somewhat different from the usually used cooling-heating function £ (Field 1965). Both functions are connected to each other via the equality [formula]. Our choice is analogous to those of Begelman & Zweibel (1994), Bogdanovi et al. (2009), Parrish et al. (2009). The function [formula] can be found, for example, in Tozzi & Norman (2001).

Equations for relativistic cosmic rays we take in the form (e.g. Lontano et al. 2002)

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

In these equations, [formula] is the momentum of a cosmic ray particle having the rest mass mcr and velocity [formula], qcr is the charge, pcr  =  γ- 1crncrTcr is the kinetic pressure, ncr is the number density in the laboratory frame, Γcr is the adiabatic index, [formula] is the relativistic factor. The continuity equation is the same as Equation (2) for j = cr. Equation (8) can be used for both cold nonrelativistic, Tcr  ≪   mcrc2, and hot relativistic, Tcr  ≫   mcrc2, cosmic rays. In the first (second) case, we have Γcr = 5 / 3 (4 / 3) (Lontano et al. 2002) . The general form of the value Rcr applying at any relations between Tcr and mcrc2, can be found e.g. in Toepfer (1971) and Dzhavakhishvili and Tsintsadze (1973).

Equations (1)-(4), (6), and (7) are solved together with Maxwell's equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula]. Below, we consider at first an equilibrium state in which there is a stationary cosmic ray current.

EQUILIBRIUM STATE

We will consider a uniform plasma embedded in an uniform magnetic field [formula] (the subscript 0 here and below denotes background parameters) directed along the z-axis. We assume that the plasma is in equilibrium and penetrated by the uniform beam of cosmic rays having the uniform streaming velocity [formula] along the y-axis. It is reasonable to suppose that in such uniform model the magnetic field due to cosmic rays will be absent. This picture is analogous to the consideration of the gravitational potential in the equilibrium state in an infinite uniform medium having a constant mass density. Then we obtain from Equation (10)

[formula]

From Equation (1), we easily find in the equilibrium state

[formula]

where we have assumed that ∂  /  ∂t  ≪  ωcj, ωcj = qjB0 / mjc is the cyclotron frequency. Analogously, we obtain from Equation (6) under condition Rcrγcr∂  /  ∂t  ≪  ωccr (ωccr = qcrB0 / mcrc)

[formula]

In Equation (13), we have neglected the polarizational drift of cosmic rays (the second term on the right hand-side for the ion velocity in Equation (12)). This can be done due to condition ni0  ≫  ncr0 (see below), which is always satisfied. Using Equations (12) and (13), we will find the current [formula]

[formula]

where we have taking into account the condition of quasi-neutrality qini0 + qene0 + qcrncr0 = 0. The number density ncr is the one in the laboratory frame. We note that this condition is satisfied in astrophysical plasmas due to cosmic ray charge neutralization from the background environment (Alfvén 1939). Substituting Equation (14) into Equation (11), we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] is the ion Alfvén velocity. Usually, the inequality c  ≫  cAi is satisfied. Thus, the induced electric field [formula] is determined by equation

[formula]

We note that this equation has been given in the paper by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010). Substituting Equation (15) into Equation (12) for ions, we find the return plasma current

[formula]

which is equal to the cosmic ray current and has an opposite direction. The induced plasma current drift velocity [formula] is equal to [formula]. Using Equation (15), we see that the polarizational cosmic ray drift velocity [formula] can be neglected in comparison with [formula] under condition mini0  ≫  Rcrγcrmcrncr0. If cosmic rays are not too relativistic, this condition is satisfied. The drift velocity [formula] will be taken into account at the consideration of thermal instability which is provided below.

We will here consider the case in which background temperatures of the electrons and ions are equal between each other, Te0 = Ti0 = T0. However, for convenience to follow the symmetric contribution of the ions and electrons, we keep in general calculations different temperatures. In this case, the thermal equations in equilibrium are given by

[formula]

PERTURBED VELOCITIES OF IONS AND ELECTRONS

Here, we will investigate one-dimensional perturbations depending on the z-coordinate. Equations for perturbed velocities of ions and electrons are given in the Appendix A. We consider Equation (A3) under condition ω2cj  ≫  ∂2  /  ∂t2. Then, the transverse velocities are given by

[formula]

where Equation (A2) has been used. We also have taken into account that B1z = 0 (see Equation (9)). The longitudinal velocities vi1z and ve1z are given by Equation (A13)

[formula]

where the values L, Hi1, and He1 are defined by Equations (A9), (A12), and (A14)-(A20).

PERTURBED PLASMA CURRENT

It is known that contribution of streaming flows to the dispersion relation is due to the difference of their velocities (e.g., Nekrasov 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c). Therefore, we can not take into account the contribution of the electric drift [formula]. We also could choose the appropriate frame of reference and make the electric drift initially zero (Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2010).

The linear components of the plasma current [formula] [formula] [formula] have the form

[formula]

where [formula] is the plasma frequency and upl = vi0y. When deriving Equation (20), we have used Equations (18) and (19) and the continuity equation.

PERTURBED VELOCITY OF COSMIC RAYS

We assume cold, nonrelativistic, Tcr  ≪  mcrc2, cosmic rays here for which Γcr = 5 / 3 (Lontano et al. 2002). In this case, the value Rcr is equal to the unity, Rcr = 1 (see Equation (8)). The interaction of cosmic rays with the background plasma can be considered without taking into account the cosmic ray back-reaction and including the latter. If cosmic rays are stationary in both equilibrium and perturbations, then we have to take the quasi-neutrality condition in the background state in the form qini0 + qene0 = 0 to avoid the appearance of the current due to the electric drift. When the cosmic ray back-reaction is involved, the condition of quasi-neutrality becomes qini0 + qene0 + qcrncr0 = 0. The last condition have been used in Section 3. We here consider the back-reaction of cosmic rays also in perturbations. We assume that the condition ω2ccr  ≫  γ4cr0∂2  /  ∂t2 is satisfied. For ultrarelativistic cold cosmic rays ([formula], the last condition can be violated. Then the velocities vcr1x,y given by Equation (B3) are the following:

[formula]

where we have used Equation (B2).

The longitudinal velocity vcr1z is defined by Equations (B6) and (B7)

[formula]

Substituting Equation (21) for vcr1y into Equation (B7) for Hcr1 and using Equation (B2), we obtain

[formula]

PERTURBED COSMIC RAY CURRENT

The linear perturbations of the components of the cosmic ray current [formula] are equal to

[formula]

where [formula] is the cosmic ray plasma frequency. When obtaining Equation (24), we have used Equations (21) and (22) and the continuity equation for cosmic rays. The value Hcr1 is defined by Equation (23).

PERTURBED TOTAL CURRENT

We find now the components of the perturbed total current [formula]. Adding Equations (20) and (24), we obtain

[formula]

where we have used the condition of quasi-neutrality qini0 + qene0 + qcrncr0 = 0.

WAVE EQUATIONS

To obtain the wave equations, we have to substitute the current (25) into Maxwell's equation (10). Omitting small terms under condition [formula] and also assuming that [formula], we find in the one-dimensional case

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here, the following notations are introduced:

[formula]

When deriving Equations (26)-(28), we have used Equations (9), (23), and (A18) without the contribution of terms proportional to v0x.

Equation (26) describes magnetosonic waves including the contribution of cosmic rays at conditions under consideration. Equations (27) and (28) describe the streaming instability due to the cosmic ray flow and thermal instability subjected to an influence of cosmic rays. We note that when ucr = 0, the thermal instability is defined from Equation (28), εzz = 0 and [formula] (Nekrasov 2011, 2012).

DISPERSION RELATIONS

Equations (27) and (28) are given in their general form which permits us to investigate different particular cases. Making use of the Fourier analysis for perturbations proportional to [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Substituting into Equation (30) expressions for εyy, εyz, εzy, and εzz, which are defined by Equation (29), we find

[formula]

where cA is the Alfvén velocity including the contribution of cosmic rays

[formula]

In Equation (31), we have introduced notations

[formula]

To calculate the right-hand side of Equation (31) with values α1,2,3 given by Equation (32), it is convenient to consider the expression [formula]. Carrying out the calculations and taking into account that [formula] and ucr  ≫  vi0y, we obtain

[formula]

It can be shown that the value ω2peG2G3  +  ω2piG1G4 acquires the simple form

[formula]

where we have taken qi =  - qe (see Equation (A19)). The value ω2peG3  +  ω2piG1 can be given in the following form:

[formula]

where C2s is given by

[formula]

In the value εzz on the left-hand side of Equation (31), we neglect the contribution of the unity which has arisen due to the displacement current. It is easy to see that it can be done if ω2pe  ≫  ω2 for the cold plasma and ω2pe  ≫  k2v2Te for the warm plasma, when the wavelength of perturbations is much larger than the Debye length. We also omit the negligible contribution of cosmic rays. Thus, we have

[formula]

Substituting Equations (33)-(35) and (37) into Equation (31), we derive the following dispersion relation:

[formula]

where we also have neglected the contribution of the displacement current. Equation (38) describes the streaming and thermal instability. Below, we consider some particular cases.

Streaming Instability without Cosmic Ray Back-Reaction

In this case, we neglect the contribution of the cosmic ray term in the dispersion relation defined by Equation (38). We also set all the frequencies Ω to zero. Then Equation (38) can be written in the form

[formula]

where [formula] is the plasma sound velocity, cAi  =  ωcic / ωpi, ρi0 = mini0, and jret is defined by Equation (16). Equation (39) coincides with Equation (9) in the paper by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) (see also Bell (2005)) .

Streaming Instability with Cosmic Ray Back-Reaction

Taking into account the back-reaction of cosmic rays, Equation (38) becomes

[formula]

where ρcr0  =   ncr0mcr. Since jcr0 = jret, the second term on the right-hand side of Equation (40) is considerably larger than the first one roughly by a factor of [formula]. Thus, the back-reaction of the streaming cosmic rays results in much more powerful instability than the induced background plasma streaming. It should be noted that this conclusion is satisfied for conditions under consideration. From Equation (40), omitting the first term on the right-hand side, we can find the wave number km and growth rate δm (δ =  - iω) of the fastest growing mode

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let us find asymptotical expressions for km and δm. In the case γ- 1cr0c2scr  ≫  c2A, we have

[formula]

Thus, [formula]. In the opposite case, γ- 1cr0c2scr  ≪  c2A, we obtain

[formula]

The relation between δm and km is the same as for solutions (43). From Equations (43) and (44), we can write expressions for k2m and δ2m, which unite both limiting cases

[formula]

In the resonance case, γ- 1cr0c2scr  ≈  c2A, we find from Equations (41) and (42)

[formula]

As we see, magnitudes given by Equation (45) in the resonance case are only twice as large as those in Equation (46). Thus, Equation (45) can be applied to a good accuracy for any relation between γ- 1cr0c2scr and c2A.

Thermal Instability with Cosmic Ray Back-reaction

From Equation (38), it is clear that the thermal instability is described by equation

[formula]

where C2s is given by Equation (36). If we set ucr = 0, then Equation (47) is satisfied. In the case [formula], the value [formula] is multiplied by a small coefficient in Equation (38) in comparison with the second term on the right-hand side of this equation. Therefore, Equation (47) is kept. Thus, cosmic rays do not influence on the thermal instability under conditions considered in this paper.

We set in Equation (47) Ti0 = Te0 = T0. Then, this equation coincides with Equation (47) in the paper by Nekrasov (2011) without the inertia term. We note that in the last paper the perturbation of the thermal energy exchange frequency has been taken into account. We further take Ωie  =  Ωei  =  Ωε. Then, we have

[formula]

where, as above, δ =  - iω and [formula]. The following notations are introduced:

[formula]

The frequencies ΩTe,i, Ωne,i, Ωei,ie, and Ωχ are given by Equation (A7). In the general form, Equation (48) can be solved numerically. We note that [formula].

We now treat Equations (48) and (49) in the limit Ωε  ≫  Ωχ,ΩTe,i,Ωne,i. In the short wavelength limit, k2c2s  ≫  δ2, the dispersion relation has the form

[formula]

where [formula]. Solution of Equation (50) is the following:

[formula]

This solution corresponds to Field's isobaric solution (Field 1965). In the long wavelength limit, k2c2s  ≪  δ2, we have equation

[formula]

where [formula]. Solution of Equation (52) is

[formula]

which corresponds to Parker's isochoric solution (Parker 1953).

Thermal Instability without Cosmic Ray Back-reaction

For ultrarelativistic cosmic rays, γcr0  →    ∞  , their back-reaction is absent (see Appendix B). In this case, Equation (38) takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

In Equation (54), we have assumed that qcr = qi and ucr  ≈  c. We also consider that ni0 = ne0. In the low-frequency regime, δ2  ≪  k2c2Ai, Equation (54) together with Equation (55) is given by

[formula]

If we assume that δ2  ≫  ω2pin2cr0 / n2i0, then we return to the case considered in the previous section. In this case, the plasma return current plays no the role. When the opposite condition, δ2  ≪  ω2pin2cr0 / n2i0, is satisfied then Equation (56) takes the form

[formula]

We see from Equation (57) that in the limiting case [formula] ([formula]) the nominator (denominator) tends to zero. In the case [formula], the dispersion relation is modified, however the qualitative character of the thermal instability does not change. Thus, the plasma return current does not influence on the thermal instability in the low-frequency regime. In the high-frequency regime, δ2  ≫  k2c2Ai, Equation (54) is the following:

[formula]

where we have assumed that δ2  ≪  ωpikcAincr0 / ni0. Again, if [formula] ([formula]), then the nominator (denominator) on the left-hand side of this equation tends to zero. Thus, the plasma return current has no effect on the thermal instability in these limiting cases. When [formula], we have solution

[formula]

The left-hand side of Equation (58) is of the order of the unity and does not describe the thermal instability for the solution given by Equation (59).

DISCUSSION

In this paper, no conditions have been used for the background plasma except for ω2cj  ≫  ∂2  /  ∂t2, which is usually satisfied in astrophysical settings. For cosmic rays, we have assumed that [formula] (see Section 9). This condition can be satisfied for moderately relativistic cosmic rays. However, it can be violated for ultrarelativistic cosmic rays. Using the growth rate (45) in the case for example [formula], the last condition can be written in the form

[formula]

where we have assumed that cA  ~  cAi and ωccr  ~  ωci. In the limit ucr  →  c, Equation (60), taking into account that Tcr  ≪  mcrc2, can be violated for sufficiently dense cosmic rays. In the opposite case, γ- 1cr0c2scr  ≪  c2A, the corresponding condition is given by

[formula]

We see from Equation (38) that at conditions under consideration and for one-dimensional perturbations along the background magnetic field cosmic rays do not influence on the thermal instability (see Sections 10.3 and 10.4). At the same time, the back-reaction of cosmic rays results in the aperiodic streaming instability much more powerful than that due to the return current of the background plasma. The maximal growth rate is achieved for sufficiently cold cosmic rays and large magnetic fields such that [formula]. In this case, the growth rate is equal to

[formula]

and the wave number is

[formula]

Thus in particular cases such as considered here as an example, the cosmic ray back-reaction must be certainly invoked to study cosmic ray streaming instabilities.

We see that the thermal instability (Equation (47)) is not influenced by the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration, if we take into account the cosmic ray back-reaction. The multi-fluid dispersion relation includes the ion inertia and has a general form except for Ti0 = Te0. In the limit of fast thermal energy exchange in which Ωε is much larger than all other frequencies, the isobaric and isochoric growth rates have been obtained (Equations (51) and (53)). Ultrarelativistic cosmic rays do not experience back-reaction. In this case, the plasma term with the return current is contained in the dispersion relation (Equation (54)). However, as we have shown, this term also does not influence on the thermal instability.

We note that all instabilities considered in this paper are connected with the particle dynamics along the background magnetic field.

We have explored the situation in which cosmic rays drift across the background magnetic field. This model has been considered by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) for the problem of the magnetic field amplification in the upstream region of the supernova remnant shocks. However, such a model can also be applied to the ICM where cosmic rays are the important ingredient (Loewenstein et al. 1991; Guo & Oh 2008; Sharma et al. 2009, 2010). In another model, cosmic rays drift along the magnetic field. This case has been investigated by Bell (2004) (see also Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009). In both cases the growth rates are the same (Bell 2004, 2005; Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2010). Such a situation can also be encountered in the ICM. In the papers by Bell (2004, 2005) and Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010), the return current of the background plasma has only been involved in the analytical treatments. The cosmic ray back-reaction has been included in the numerical analysis and found to determine the saturation of the instability (Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009, 2010). However, the influence of the cosmic ray back-reaction on the growth rate remained unknown.

As we have obtained in this paper, the cosmic ray back-reaction drives the instability whose growth rate is proportional to n- 1 / 2cr0, but not n- 1 / 2i0 as the one due to the return plasma current. Therefore, this instability can produce much larger magnetic field amplification in both the upstream medium of shocks and ICM. In unstable regions, an enhanced X-ray radiation must be observed.

ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS

Our linear analysis of the instabilities related to the current-driven instability by cosmic rays is applicable to a variety of environments. Although such a type of instability was suggested originally for the magnetic field amplification in the shocks by the supernova, we think, wherever there is a strong cosmic ray streaming, this instability may play a significant role. For example, if the supernova driven shock propagates through a hot and low density medium (i.e., superbubbles), then the current-driven instability may exist. Even at larger scales, such as shocks in the ICM, we may expect this instability under some conditions. Most of the previous analytical studies are restricted to cosmic rays drifting along the ambient magnetic field without their back-reaction and possible thermal effects. Interestingly, our analysis shows that inclusion of back-reaction will lead to a much stronger instability in comparison to the previous studies where this effect is neglected. So, we expect that the magnetic field is amplified to a larger value in the presence of the back-reaction of cosmic rays. This implies more confinement of cosmic rays with excited turbulent motions in the non-linear regime and accordingly the acceleration of cosmic rays to higher energies.

In some of supernova remnants such as IC 443, SN 1006, Kepler, Tycho and etc., the driven shocks are propagating in their partially ionized ambient medium. This was a good motivation to extend CRCD instability from MHD approach to a two-fluid case, by considering ions and neutrals as two separate fluids where they can exchange momentum via collisions (e.g., Reville et al. 2007; see also Bykov & Toptygin 2005). It was shown the instability is getting slower rate because of collisions of ions with neutrals, in particular when the cosmic ray flux is not very strong. However, the back-reaction of cosmic rays has not been considered by Reville et al. (2007). Considering the finding that the growth rate is significantly enhanced in the presence of cosmic ray back-reaction in a two-fluid system consisting of the ions and electrons, one may naturally expect such an effect in a three-fluid system consisting of the ions, electrons, and neutrals. It deserves a further study, but we may expect that the stabilizing effect of the ion-neutral collisions will be compensated by the back-reaction of cosmic rays.

CONCLUSION

Using the multi-fluid approach, we have investigated streaming and thermal instabilities of the electron-ion plasma with homogeneous cold cosmic rays drifting across the background magnetic field. We have taken into account the return current of the background plasma and the back-reaction of cosmic rays for one-dimensional perturbations along the magnetic field. It has been shown that the cosmic ray back-reaction results in a streaming instability having considerably larger growth rate than that due to usually treated return current of the background plasma. The maximal growth rates and corresponding wave numbers have been found.

The thermal instability has been shown to be not subjected to the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relation for the thermal instability in the multi-fluid approach has been derived which includes the ion inertia. In the limit of fast thermal energy exchange between electrons and ions the isobaric and isochoric growth rates have been obtained.

The results of this paper can be useful for the investigation of the electron-ion astrophysical objects such as galaxy clusters including the dynamics of streaming cosmic rays.
