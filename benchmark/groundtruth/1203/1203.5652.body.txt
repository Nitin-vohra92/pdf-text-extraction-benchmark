Highly transitive actions of free products

Introduction

Let X be a countable set and let G be a countable group acting on X. The action is called highly transitive if, for all [formula], it is transitive on ordered k-tuples of distinct elements.

Dixon proved [\cite=Dixon] that for any integer k  ≥  2, generically in Baire's sense, k permutations [formula] such that the subgroup [formula] acts without finite orbits generate a free group of rank k which acts highly transitively on [formula]. Adapting this approach, Kitroser [\cite=Kitroser] showed that the fundamental groups of surfaces of genus at least 2 admit a faithful and highly transitive action.

Garion and Glasner [\cite=GarionGlasner] proved that for n  ≥  4 the group of outer automorphisms of free group on n generators [formula] admits a faithful and highly transitive action. They asked whether [formula] and [formula] admit a highly transitive action. In this paper, with methods in Dixon's spirit, we prove the following result.

Let G,H be non-trivial finite or countable groups. Then, the following statements are equivalent:

the free product G * H admits a faithful and highly transitive action;

at least one of the factors G,H is not isomorphic to the cyclic group [formula].

In particular, the group [formula] admits a faithful and highly transitive action. As a consequence, the group [formula] admits a highly transitive action on a countable set. On the other hand, this group cannot admit faithful and highly transitive actions since it has non-trivial center (see Corollary [\ref=GeneralFactsFHT]).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 contains preliminaries about highly transitive actions and Baire's theory. Sections 2 and 3 are devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

We thank Georges Skandalis for suggesting Corollary [\ref=NotSolvable] and Alain Valette for pointing out a small mistake in the last proof in the first version of this paper.

Preliminaries

Generalities about group actions

Let us begin with a general fact concerning actions with infinite orbits.

(B. H. Neumann, P. Neumann) Let G be a group acting on some set X and F be a finite subset of X. If every orbit of the points in F is infinite, then there exists g∈G such that [formula].

This follows from Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=NeumannCovered] and Lemma 2.3 in [\cite=NeumannFinitary]. Indeed, let us suppose that for every g∈G, [formula]. If we denote Kxy: = {g∈G|gx = y}, [formula], y∈F, then by hypothesis we have [formula]. When [formula], we have [formula] with some gxy∈Kxy. Then

[formula]

Then by Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=NeumannCovered], there exists y∈F such that the index of [formula] is finite. Therefore the orbit Gy is finite.

From the above lemma, it follows immediately that:

Let X be a G-set and F1, F2 be finite subsets of X. If every orbit of the points in F1 and F2 are infinite, then there exists g∈G such that [formula].

Highly transitive actions

Let G be a group acting on some set X. Let us recall that the action is called faithful if the corresponding homomorphism [formula] is injective and transitive if for any x,y∈X, there exists g∈G such that g  ·  x  =  y. Given a positive integer k, we set

[formula]

and the action [formula] is called k-transitive if the diagonal G-action on X(k) is transitive.

Assume that G and X are countable. The action [formula] is called highly transitive if it is k-transitive for any positive integer k.

Defining highly transitive actions on a finite set Y would not be interesting, since Y(k) is empty for all k > |Y|.

We are interested to determine which groups admit highly transitive actions respectively faithful and highly transitive actions. Here are some general facts, which are probably well-known by experts; see e.g. [\cite=GarionGlasner] for item (2).

Let [formula] be a highly transitive action. Then:

any central element of G acts trivially;

for any normal subgroup [formula], the action [formula] is either trivial, or highly transitive.

for any finite index subgroup H < G, the action [formula] is highly transitive.

(1) Let g be an element of G which acts non-trivially and let x1∈X such that x1 and x2: = gx1 are distinct. Let y1,y2∈X such that y2 is distinct from y1 and gy1 (this is possible since X is infinite). Then, by high transitivity, there is an element h∈G such that hx1 = y1 and hx2 = y2. We have

[formula]

which proves that g is not a central element.

(2) Suppose that the action is not trivial, i.e. that there exists x∈X and k∈K such that x  ≠  kx. For any y∈X different from x, there exists g∈G such that gx = x and gy = kx. Then g- 1kgx = y and therefore y is in K  ·  x by normality of K in G. This proves that the action [formula] is transitive.

Let [formula] and [formula] in X(k). By Lemma [\ref=DeplacementPartiesFinies], there exists h∈K such that

[formula]

Then [formula] is in X(2k). Take [formula]. Again by Lemma [\ref=DeplacementPartiesFinies], there exists h'∈K such that [formula]. Then [formula] is in X(2k). Since the G-action on X is highly transitive, there exists g∈G such that

[formula]

Then zi = gxi and ghyi = h'zi = h'gxi, so

[formula]

for every [formula]. Since K is normal in G, the element h- 1g- 1h'g is in K and therefore [formula] is highly transitive.

(3) There exists a normal subgroup [formula], contained in H, which has finite index in G. It cannot act trivially since

[formula]

For faithful and highly transitive actions, we have the following straightforward corollary:

Assume that [formula] is a faithful and highly transitive action. Then:

the center Z(G) is trivial;

for any non-trivial normal subgroup [formula], the action [formula] is faithful and highly transitive;

for any finite index subgroup H < G, the H-action on X is faithful and highly transitive.

If [formula] is a faithful and highly transitive action, then G is not solvable.

For any [formula], the n-th derived subgroup G(n) is a normal subgroup of G. If G(k) is non-trivial, then it acts highly transitively on X by Corollary [\ref=GeneralFactsFHT] (2), so that it is non-abelian, by Corollary [\ref=GeneralFactsFHT] (1). Hence G(k + 1) is non-trivial. This proves (by induction) that G is not solvable.

Notice that if G contains a finite index subgroup which admits a faithful and highly transitive action, this does not imply that G itself admits a faithful and highly transitive action. For example, [formula] has a free subgroup of index 12, but does not admit a faithful and highly transitive action since its center is non-trivial.

Baire spaces

Let X be a countable set. For any enumeration [formula], one can consider the distance on the group [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then, [formula] becomes a complete ultrametric space and a topological group. Note that a sequence (σn) in [formula] converges to a permutation σ if and only if, given any finite subset F  ⊂  X, the permutations σ and σn, respectively σ- 1 and σ- 1n, coincide on F for n large enough. Hence the topology on [formula] is independent of the chosen enumeration. One can notice that a subgroup Γ of [formula] is dense if and only if the Γ-action on X is highly transitive.

As a complete metrizable space, [formula] is a Baire space, that is a topological space in which every countable intersection of dense open subsets is still dense. In such a space, a countable intersection of dense open subsets is called generic subset, or co-meager subset, while its complement (that is countable union of closed sets with empty interior) is called meager subset. In particular, generic subsets are dense, thus non-empty.

The case of free products G * H with two infinite factors (see Section [\ref=InfiniteFactors]) will be treated by genericity arguments in [formula]. For the case of free products G * H with a finite factor, we need to consider a clever Baire space that we introduce now. Let us consider two non-trivial finite or countable groups G,H and assume that X is endowed with some G-action such that it is isomorphic (in the category of G-sets) to [formula], where G acts by left multiplication on the first factor. The product [formula] admits the following complete metric:

[formula]

where [formula] is endowed with the metric defined above. One can again see that the topology on [formula] does not depend on the choice of an enumeration of X. Moreover, when H is finite, this topology coincides with the product topology. The set of H-actions on X identifies then with the subset [formula]. It is easy to check that this subset is closed in [formula], hence is a complete metrizable space.

Let X be a G-set. We call an action [formula] admissible if all orbits 〈G,σ(H)〉 in X are infinite.

The set of admissible actions will be denoted by A(G,H,X).

Notice that A(G,H,X) is non-empty. Indeed, if we identify [formula] to [formula] (which is indeed countable), X is identified (as a G-set) to G * H. Then the H-action by left multiplications on G * H corresponds to a H-action on X which is admissible.

The space A(G,H,X) is a complete metrizable space.

In particular, the space A(G,H,X) is a Baire space.

It suffices to check that A(G,H,X) is closed in [formula]. To do so, let us consider a sequence [formula] in A(G,H,X) which converges to [formula] and prove that σ is an admissible action. Firstly, if we assume that F is a finite orbit of the subgroup 〈G,σ(H)〉, then for n large enough, the components of σn (and their inverses) would coincide with the components of σ (and their inverses) on F and F would be a finite orbit of the subgroup 〈G,σn(H)〉, which is impossible since σn is an admissible action. Secondly, if x1,x2 are two distinct points in the intersection of some G-orbit and some σ(H)-orbit, then for n large enough, x1 and x2 would belong to the intersection of some G-orbit and some σn(H)-orbit, which is again impossible since σn is an admissible action.

Case with two infinite factors

The aim of this section is to prove the following result.

If G and H are countable groups, then the free product [formula] admits a faithful and highly transitive action.

It will be a direct consequence of two propositions in the following setting. Let X be a countable set and let G,H be two subgroups of [formula]. For any [formula], let us consider the action [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula] with [formula] and [formula].

Let G,H be countable groups; let X be the countable set considered above. One can endow X with a G-action and a H-action which are both transitive and free. Then, G and H can be identified with their images in [formula]. Moreover, by Propositions [\ref=FreeProductInfiniteOrbit] and [\ref=FreeProductFaithful], we can take a permutation [formula] (in fact, [formula] is generic in [formula]); the G * H-action φσ is then highly transitive and faithful.

For every [formula] and [formula], [formula], let

[formula]

Since [formula], it is enough to prove that the set Uk,x,y is open and dense.

Let σ∈Uk,x,y and let w such that wσ(xi) = yi for every [formula]. The map σ  ↦  wσ is continuous and the inverse image of the open set [formula] contains σ and is contained in Uk,x,y. Thus the set Uk,x,y is a neighborhood of σ and this shows that Uk,x,y is open.

Let us show that Uk,x,y is dense. Let F  ⊂  X be a finite subset of X and [formula]. Given a subset Y  ⊆  X, we denote by τ±  1(Y) the union [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. We start by a variation of Remark [\ref=DeplacementDeuxPartiesFinies].

For any finite subsets A,B of X, there exists g∈G such that

[formula]

Similarly, there exists h∈H such that [formula].

Indeed, set [formula]. By Remark [\ref=DeplacementDeuxPartiesFinies], there exists g∈G (respectively h∈H) such that [formula] and [formula]. This implies [formula] and [formula], hence [formula]. The Claim is proved.

Hence, there exists g1∈G such that [formula]. Then, taking A = J and [formula], the Claim shows that there exists g2∈G such that the sets [formula], [formula], and [formula] are pairwise disjoint. We then choose a finite subset [formula] such that the set [formula] is disjoint from the finite sets considered so far. Again by the Claim (with A = M and [formula]), there exists h∈H such that the sets

[formula]

are pairwise disjoint.

We then define a permutation σ of X by

[formula]

[formula]

for every [formula], and σ(x): = τ(x) for every other points of X. In particular, σ|F  =  τ|F and (g- 12hg1)σ(xi) = yi for all [formula]. This shows that σ∈Uk,x,y and the set Uk,x,y is dense.

This follows from the genericity of O1 in [\cite=Moon]; here we give a self-contained proof in the case of free products.

For every w∈G * H, let [formula]. We have

[formula]

So it is enough to show that for every [formula], the set Uw is open and dense.

It is clear that Uw is open. Let us show that Uw is dense. If w is a nontrivial element of G or H, then [formula] since G and H act faithfully on X. If [formula] and w  ≠  gh (with [formula] and [formula]), then we can write

[formula]

with k  ≥  2, gk∈G, [formula], [formula] and h1∈H.

Let [formula] and let F be a finite subset of X. Since the elements [formula], [formula] have infinite supports, there exist [formula] such that:

none of these points are in [formula];

these points are pairwise disjoint, except possibly x0 = x1 and y2k = y2k - 1;

for every [formula], we have hj + 1(x2j) = x2j + 1;

for every [formula], we have gj(y2j - 1) = y2j.

If x0 = x1, put y0 = y1; if not, put y0 = x0. Then put σ(yi) = xi for every [formula] and σ(x) = σ'(x) for all x∈F. This defines a bijection between [formula] and [formula]. By extending the definition of σ to the other points, we thus obtain a permutation [formula] such that σ|F  =  σ'|F and wσ(y0) = y2k  ≠  y0. In case where w = gh with [formula] and [formula], there exist pairwise disjoint points y0,x0,x1,y1,y2 outside of [formula] such that hx0 = x1 and gy1 = y2. Then we define a permutation [formula] such that σ(y0) = x0, σ(y1) = x1 and σ|F  =  σ'|F so that wσ(y0) = y2  ≠  y0. This proves that σ∈Uw and therefore Uw is dense in [formula].

Case with one finite factor

Definitions and notations

Let G, H two non-trivial finite or countable groups. In this section, the set X will be identified with the disjoint union of a countable collection of copies of G:

[formula]

First of all, we give some definitions and fix the notations. Given an action [formula] and [formula], this induces an action of [formula] on X. Denote by Xσ the Schreier graph of this action with respect to the generating set [formula] and by dσ the distance on Xσ. Given u∈G * H, we denote by uσ the image of u in the subgroup 〈G,σ(H)〉 of [formula].

Let w∈G * H and x∈X. We call σ-trajectory of w from x the sequence

[formula]

where sj(w) is the suffix of w of length j (that is, if [formula] is written as a normal form, then [formula]).

Consider the graph where the vertices are the right cosets Gw and Hw, with w∈G * H, and the edges are the elements of G * H, such that the edge w links two vertices Gw and Hw. Recall that [\cite=SerreArbres] this is a tree, called Bass-Serre tree of G * H and denote by T its geometric realization (which is a real tree). Endowed with the right invariant word metric with respect to the generating set [formula], the map of G * H in T which sends an element w on the middle point between the vertices Gw and Hw is an isometric injection. From now on, we will identify [formula] with the image (cf. Figure [\ref=BStree]).

Let Z be a real tree and p, q∈Z. We call shadow of q at p the set of the points z∈Z such that the geodesic from p to z passes the point q (cf. Figure [\ref=ombre]). We will denote it by [formula].

Remark that [formula] is a subtree of Z and that q is the closest point to p in this subtree. In addition, it is easy to see the following properties:

if r is in [formula], then [formula] is contained in [formula].

two shadows [formula] and [formula] are either disjoint or nested.

Let [formula] be the shadow (of the image) of the vertex H at 1 in T and let

[formula]

Then [formula] where w runs in the set of non trivial elements of G * H such that the normal form starts and terminates with an element of H. Let

[formula]

Then [formula] where w runs in the set of elements of G * H such that the normal form of w is either 1, or starts with an element of G and terminates with an element of H. Therefore, Y is invariant under G-action (by left multiplication) and [formula] is invariant under H-action.

Main result of this Section

Let

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and recall that A is a Baire space (see Section [\ref=PrelimBaire]).

If H is finite and |H|  ≥  3, then [formula] is generic in A.

For w∈G * H, [formula] and x̄,∈X(k), where [formula] and [formula], we put

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

So it is enough to prove that the sets Uk,x̄, and U'w are open and dense in A.

Since [formula] where [formula] which is open, the set Uk,x̄, is open. Furthermore the set U'w is clearly open.

We shall now prove that Uk,x̄, and U'w are dense in A. We fixe from now on [formula], x̄,∈X(k) and F a finite subset of X. Let σ∈A. To see that the set Uk,x̄, is dense, we need to show that there exists α∈Uk,x̄, such that α|F  =  σ|F. By taking a bigger finite set containing F if necessary, we can suppose that [formula] are contained in F. Let

[formula]

Since F and H are finite, K is also finite. Additionally let

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is infinite if G is infinite, but it has finitely many G-orbits. Remark that [formula] is not empty since otherwise K would be formed with finite 〈G,σ(H)〉-orbits which contradicts to the assumption that σ is in A.

Recall that T+ is the shadow of H at 1 in T and [formula]. Since [formula] is formed by infinitely many G-orbits (i.e. infinitely many copies Gj), there exists a G-equivariant bijection between [formula], where G acts trivially on the second factor, and [formula]. We can then extend this to a bijection φ between [formula] and [formula] by sending (1,z) on z for every [formula]. Henceforth, we denote by Yz (resp. [formula]), the image of Y  ×  {z} (resp. [formula]) in [formula].

Since K is σ(H)-invariant, we can define an action [formula] as follows: (cf. Figure [\ref=ActionBeta]):

β|K  =  σ|K;

for every [formula], the restriction of β to [formula] corresponds to the action of H on [formula] by left multiplication on the first factor.

The action β is in A.

The 〈G,β(H)〉-orbits are infinite since for the points in [formula], it follows from the construction, and for the points in K, it is because the 〈G,σ(H)〉-orbits are infinite and thus β∈A..

The action of β induces an action of G * H on X. Denote by Xβ the Schreier graph of this action with respect to the generating set [formula] and by dβ the distance on Xβ. Remark that

for every z  ≠  z' in [formula], there is no edge of Xβ that links an element of Yz and an element of Yz';

the edges of Xβ that link [formula] to a subset Yz are labeled by elements of H, and they link z = φ(1,z) to an element of the form φ(h,z) with [formula];

the restriction of the distance dβ to [formula] corresponds via φ- 1 to the right invariant word metric on [formula].

Since [formula] embeds isometrically in the real tree T, each [formula] can be embedded isometrically into a real tree Tz, and we can moreover require that no subtree of Tz contains the image of [formula]. This real tree Tz is essentially unique (cf. for example Lemma 2.13 in [\cite=Bestvina]). Notice that G and H do not act on the union of X and the trees Tz.

Let w∈G * H and x∈K. Suppose that the β-trajectory of w from x is not contained in K and let z = sj(w)β(x) be the first point of this trajectory that is outside of K. Then z is contained in [formula] and the end of this trajectory is a geodesic sequence in [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

for every j  ≤  n < m  ≤  |w|.

Let us write [formula] as the normal form. By hypothesis, we have

[formula]

Since K is β(H)-invariant, aj is in G, aj + 1 is in H and [formula] are alternatively in G and H. The end of the β-trajectory of the word [formula] from z satisfies

[formula]

for every [formula]. Thus this trajectory is a geodesic sequence in [formula] and this proves the claim.

There exist v1, [formula] such that

their normal forms start with an element of G;

the sets K, vβ1(K) and vβ2(K) are pairwise disjoint.

Since β is in A, by Lemma [\ref=DeplacementPartiesFinies], there exists u1∈G * H such that [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. If the normal form of u1 starts with an element of G, we put v1: = u1; otherwise, we put v1: = gu1. In both cases, the normal form of v1 starts with an element of G. In addition, for every x∈K, the β-trajectory of v1 from x passes the point uβ1(x), which is not in K. Thus by Claim [\ref=Claim2], we have [formula]. Let

[formula]

The normal form of v2 starts with an element of G. Furthermore, for every x∈K, the β-trajectory of v2 from x passes the point vβ1(x), which is not in K. So by Claim [\ref=Claim2], we have

[formula]

thus the sets K, vβ1(K) and v2(K) are pairwise disjoint. This concludes the claim.

Given a point [formula], there exists a unique point [formula] such that x is in [formula]. For the rest of the proof, we denote by [formula] the shadow of x at z in Tz.

Let M be a finite subset of [formula] such that every element y∈M can be written as y = vβy(xy), where xy∈K and the normal form of [formula] starts with an element of [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that

the normal form of w starts with an element of G and terminates with an element of H;

[formula];

[formula], for every p  ≠  p' in wβ(M).

Let [formula] and [formula] (recall that H has at least 3 elements). Let y  ≠  y'∈M. Then,

[formula]

Thus if [formula], then [formula] is also empty. Notice that this argument works as well if we take w = gh'.

Now let us suppose that [formula]. Without loss of generality, we suppose that [formula] is contained in [formula]. Notice that d(y,y')  ≥  2 since y, y'∈M and y  ≠  y'. Let h1∈H and g1∈G the labels of the first two edges of the geodesic from y to y' in Xβ. One of the elements h, h', say h, is different from h1. Thus [formula] is disjoint to [formula] and [formula].

Therefore, if given a finite subset [formula] we denote by ns(S) the number of pairs (q,q')∈S  ×  S such that [formula], then we have

[formula]

In addition, Claim [\ref=Claim2] guaranties that (gh)β(M) and (gh')β(M) do not intersect with K. By repeating this operation at most |M| times, we obtain an element w as we wished.

Now let

[formula]

where v1, v2 are the elements as in Claim [\ref=Claim3]. Then there is w as in Claim [\ref=Claim4]. We thus have two elements wj  =  wvj∈G * H (j = 1,2) such that

the normal form of wj (j = 1,2) starts with an element of G;

the set [formula] and the shadows of the elements of [formula] are pairwise disjoint.

In addition, the β-trajectory of w1 and w2 from the points in K do not intersect with the shadows of the points of [formula] before their last points, since as soon as the β-trajectories leave K, they are geodesic lines by Claim [\ref=Claim2].

We then define an action α by modifying β as follows (cf. Figure [\ref=ActionAlpha]). We choose k(|H| - 2) points pi,j (where 3  ≤  i  ≤  |H| and 1  ≤  j  ≤  k), outside of K and such that:

their G-orbits are pairwise disjoint;

for each i, j, the H-orbit of pi,j is contained in [formula];

[formula] does not intersect with the β-trajectory of w1 and of w2 from the points of K.

Let h be a non trivial element of H. For each [formula], we put H in bijection with

[formula]

in such a way that wβ1(xj) corresponds to 1 and wβ2(yj) corresponds to h. We then transfer the H-action by left multiplication in order to define α on the Aj's. The other points of β(H)-orbits of the families Aj, are defined as fixed points under the α(H)-action. For every other points, we set α(x)  =  β(x) so that we have in particular α|F  =  β|F.

By construction, the 〈G,α(H)〉-orbits are infinite since the Schreier graph of each orbit contains an infinite subtree. Furthermore we have

[formula]

for every j, and therefore α∈Uk,x̄,. Besides, σ, β and α coincide on F, which proves that Uk,x̄, is dense in A.

Finally, if σ is in A and F is the finite set of X as before, then this β-action is faithful as well and σ|F  =  β|F. Therefore U'w, for [formula], are dense. This achieves the proof of Theorem [\ref=ThmFiniteFactor].

In case [formula], the group G * H is isomorphic to the infinite dihedral group, which has trivial center but it contains a cyclic subgroup of index 2. Hence G * H does not admit any faithful and highly transitive action by Corollary [\ref=GeneralFactsFHT].

If at least one of the factors G, H is not isomorphic to the cyclic group [formula], By Theorem [\ref=FreeProductInfinite] and Theorem [\ref=ThmFiniteFactor] it admits a faithful and highly transitive actions.
