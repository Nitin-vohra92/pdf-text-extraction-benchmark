Low-disorder microwave cavity lattices for quantum simulation with photons

Solving seemingly simple problems in quantum mechanics is a formidable task for even the most sophisticated classical computers. For this reason Feynman proposed using controlled quantum systems to simulate and study other quantum systems [\cite=Feynman1982]. The development of such quantum simulators [\cite=Buluta2009] has since been an active area of research in a number of physical systems, including ultracold atoms in traps and optical lattices [\cite=Lewenstein2006] [\cite=Bloch2008], trapped ions [\cite=Gerritsma2010], and Josephson junction arrays [\cite=Fazio2001].

An idea of growing interest is to use photons as particles in a quantum simulator for non-equilibrium systems [\cite=Koch2009] [\cite=Hartmann2006] [\cite=Greentree2006] [\cite=Angelakis2007] [\cite=Hayward2012] [\cite=Nissen2012] [\cite=Houck2012]. According to this idea, a photon lattice is created with an array of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) elements, each consisting of a photonic cavity coupled strongly to a two level system, or qubit. Systems consisting of up to three coupled cavities have been realized for quantum information processing [\cite=Johnson2010] [\cite=Mariantoni2008] [\cite=Wang2011], and early proposals consider using larger arrays as a possible quantum computing architecture [\cite=Helmer2009] [\cite=DiVincenzo2009] [\cite=Steffen2012], but a lattice-based quantum simulator of this type has yet to be realized.

In these lattices, photons can hop between neighboring cavities and experience an effective photon-photon interaction within each cavity, mediated by the qubit. The superconducting circuit architecture is an attractive candidate for realizing such lattices due to the flexibility afforded by lithographic fabrication and the relative ease of attaining strong coupling [\cite=Blais2004]. Such cQED lattices have been predicted to exhibit a wide variety of phenomena, including a superfluid-Mott insulator transition [\cite=Koch2009] [\cite=Hartmann2006] [\cite=Greentree2006] [\cite=Angelakis2007], macroscopic quantum self trapping [\cite=Schmidt2010], and fractional quantum Hall physics [\cite=Hayward2012].

In order to jump-start the implementation of these lattice-based simulators, we have fabricated and characterized 25 arrays of cavities, with each cavity designed to be identical.(Devices discussed here do not include qubits yet.) In this letter, we focus on understanding and reducing uncontrolled disorder in arrays of resonators in a kagome geometry, the most natural two-dimensional lattice for such transmission line resonators. We find that disorder in the individual resonator frequencies mainly originates from variations in the kinetic inductance due to small changes in the transverse dimensions of each resonator. We reduce disorder to less than two parts in 104 with a suitable choice in the geometric layout of our transmission line resonators.

The system of coupled cavities is described by the Hamiltonian:

[formula]

where [formula] are the photon creation and annihilation operators corresponding to resonator i in the array. We denote the frequency of resonator i and its shift due to random disorder by ωr and δi, respectively. The hopping rate between resonators i and j is given by

[formula]

where Cij denotes the coupling capacitance between the cavities and Z0 the characteristic impedance of the transmission line [\cite=NunnenKamp2011]. The array we study consists of twelve resonators coupled capacitively at their endpoints in a two-dimensional kagome geometry (Fig. [\ref=DevicePic]). Photon hopping was achieved by coupling triples of resonators in the interior of the array with symmetric three-way capacitors. This coupling scheme naturally results in a kagome lattice.

Uncontrolled disorder is a serious impediment to using such arrays for quantum simulation. Here, we work to understand the origins and minimize the level of disorder to mitigate this problem. In an ideal array with uniform resonator frequencies and hopping rate t, the spacing between normal mode frequencies scales linearly with the photon hopping rate, with a frequency separation between the highest and lowest modes of [formula]; which arises from diagonalizing the 12x12 matrix resulting from Eq. [\eqref=Hamiltonian]. Assuming that disorder in coupling capacitances is negligible, we find that disorder in resonator frequencies leads to shifts of the normal mode frequencies through the first term in Eq. [\eqref=Hamiltonian] by an amount ~  δi, whereas the additional disorder in tij only results in corrections ~  δit / ωr. Since ωr  ≫  tij, we can thus approximate the photon hopping rate to be uniform with value t = 2Z0C  ω2r for nearest-neighbor resonators, and tij = 0 for other resonator pairs. Therefore, we are primarily concerned with effects of disorder in resonator frequencies.

Without disorder, there are eight distinct mode frequencies, four of which are doubly degenerate. The presence of disorder breaks the degeneracy, widens the distribution of normal mode frequencies, and results in twelve distinct frequencies. We study the effects of disorder by numerically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian for random {δi} drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation σ. The resulting histogram for the number of eigenmodes N(ω)  dω in a given frequency interval
