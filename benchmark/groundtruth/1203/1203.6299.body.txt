Interpreting the projective hierarchy in expansions of the real line

Introduction

The main technical result is the following generalization of [\cite=discrete].

Hence a structure R that satisfies the assumptions of Theorem A defines the image of [formula] under a semialgebraic injection. The theory of such a structure is undecidable.

The significance of Theorem A comes from the fact that it is applicable outside the setting of expansions of the ordered field of real numbers. In particular, Theorem A allows us to settle some open questions about expansions of the additive group of real numbers. The most significant is the following answer to questions raised by Chris Miller. A real number is called non-quadratic if it is not the solution to a quadratic equation with rational coefficients.

Note that the sets [formula] and [formula] are definable in [formula]. Since α is assumed to be non-quadratic, Theorem B follows immediately from the following stronger result.

Theorems B and C are in stark contrast to results about [formula]. This structure admits a quantifier elimination result and its theory is decidable (due independently to Weispfenning [\cite=weis] and Miller [\cite=ivp]). However, the structures in Theorem B and C define multiplication on [formula] and hence every projective set. This is a much stronger property in respect to what kind of sets are definable than the property of just defining multiplication on [formula]. Consider [formula], the expansion of [formula], by all nonempty subsets of all cartesian products [formula], where k ranges over all natural numbers. This structure defines multiplication on [formula], is undecidable, but by Friedman and Miller [\cite=sparse] every definable set is a union of an open set and a discrete set.

Theorem A can also be applied to expansions by analytic functions. Consider the structure [formula]. Marker and Steinhorn showed in unpublished work that every definable set in this expansion is a union of an open set and a discrete set; for a proof of this result, see Toffalori and Vozoris [\cite=sin]. Adding a predicate for [formula] to this structure destroys this tameness completely.

Several remarks about the proof of Theorem A and its connection to earlier work are in order. A stronger form of Theorem A was proved for expansions of the ordered fields in [\cite=discrete], but we will show that this result follows from Theorem A in this setting. The proof of Theorem A is not a minor modification of the proof of Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=discrete]. The latter proof depends crucially on the definability of multiplication and does not transfer to our setting. In order to establish the conclusion of Theorem A, it is enough to show that every subset of all cartesian products Dk, where k ranges over [formula], is definable. For every [formula], boxes with endpoints in f(D) form a countable basis of the induced topology on Un. Hence we only need to show that the set of endpoints is definable. Similar to the earlier work in [\cite=discrete] our approach relies on the idea of regarding the function f as a definable approximation scheme. The key idea here is to realizes that for every c∈U, the set of best approximations of c (see Definition 1) is definable and varies heavily in c. Given a subset X  ⊆  Dk, in order to show that X is definable, we describe a family of definable sets (Ya), depending on a parameter a, such that Ya is the image of a definable subset of the set of best approximations of a under the function g. We then find a [formula] such that Yc  =  X. The parameter c will be constructed as a limit of a subset of f(D). As in the earlier work, this construction rests on the topological completeness of [formula].

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 some definitions and a few basic results are established. The proof of Theorem A and the details of how Theorem B to D follow from Theorem A can be found in Section 3. Section 4 contains a couple of remarks about the optimality of Theorem A.

Notation

We will write [formula] for {1,2,3,...}.

Definitions

In the following, let R be an expansion of the ordered set [formula] such that R defines an open interval [formula], a closed and discrete set [formula] and a function f:D  →  U with f(D) dense in U. In this section, we will introduce several definitions and establish some of their properties.

Let c∈U. We say d∈D is a best approximation of c from the left if f(d)  <  c and

[formula]

We write L(c) for the set of best approximations of c from the left. Similarly, we say d∈D is a best approximation of c from the right if f(d) > c and

[formula]

and write R(c) for the set of best approximations of c from the right.

By density of f(D) in U, sup f(L(c)) = c =  inf f(R(c)) for every c∈U.

Let d∈D and let (L,R) be a pair of finite subsets of D≤  d. We say (L,R) is a finite approximation up to d if

f(dl)  <  f(dr), for dl∈L,dr∈R,

f is strictly increasing on L and strictly decreasing on R,

for every e∈D≤  d

[formula]

If e∈D with e > d and (L',R') is an approximation up to e such that L  ⊆  L' and R  ⊆  R', we say (L',R') is an extension of (L,R) up to e.

Let (L,R) be a pair of finite subsets of D and let d∈D. Then the following are equivalent

(L,R) is a finite approximation up to d,

if max f(L)  ≤  c  ≤   min f(R), then

[formula]

The proof of (ii)⇒  (i) is immediate from the definition of a finite approximation. For the other implication, suppose that (L,R) is a finite approximation. Since L and R are finite, max f(L)  <   min f(R) by (1). Let [formula] be such that max f(L)  <  c  <   min f(R). Now (2) and (3) guarantee that [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be a strictly increasing sequence of elements in D and for every [formula], let (Ln,Rn) be a finite approximation up to dn such that both Ln and Rn are non-empty, and (Ln,Rn) is an extension of (Lm,Rm) for every [formula] with m < n . Then there is a unique c∈U such that

[formula] for all [formula], and

[formula].

In such a situation, we say c is approximated by [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] satisfy the assumptions. Since Lm  ⊆  Ln and Rm  ⊆  Rn for every [formula] with m < n, the sequence [formula] is increasing, the sequence [formula] is decreasing and max f(Ln)  <   min f(Rn) for every [formula]. Hence the set [formula] is a non-empty subset of U. Let c be an element in this intersection. By Lemma [\ref=approxcon], [formula] and [formula] for every n. Hence

[formula]

Since sup f(L(c))  =   inf f(R(c)), we get [formula].

Let d1,d2∈D with d1  ≤  d2 and let (L,R) be a finite approximation up to d1. Then there is a unique extension (L',R') of (L,R) up to d2 such that L = L'.

Let [formula] be such that max f(L) < c  <   min f(R) and there is no e∈D with e  ≤  d2 and max f(L)  ≤  f(e)  <  c. It is easy to see that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Hence [formula] extends (L,R). The uniqueness follows from Lemma [\ref=approxcon].

We call (L',R') the right extension of (L,R) up to d2.

Let d1,d2∈D with d1  <  d2. We say f splits between d1 and d2, if for every e1,e2∈D with e1,e2  ≤  d1 and f(e1) < f(e2), there is e3∈D with d1 < e3  ≤  d2 such that f(e1) < f(e3) < f(e2).

By density of f(D), for every d1∈D there is d2∈D such that d1  <  d2 and f splits between d1 and d2. If f splits between d1 and d2 and d > d2, then f splits between d1 and d.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem A

Let R be an expansion of the ordered set [formula]. Assume that R defines an open interval [formula], a closed and discrete set [formula] and functions f:D  →  R and [formula] such that

f(D) is dense in U,

for every [formula] and d,e∈D with a < b and e  ≤  d

[formula]

Let W  ⊆  Um be open. We have to show that W is definable. Since the lexicographic order topology on [formula] has a countable basis and f(D) is dense in U, we can find a sequence [formula] of elements in D2m such that

[formula]

It is only left to show that the range of these sequences is definable. We will show that for every [formula] every subset of Dm is definable.

Let A  ⊆  Dm and let [formula] be an enumeration of A. We will now show that A is definable.

Let [formula]. Let δc be the successor function on the well-ordered set (L(c1), < ) and let δic denote the i-th iterate of δc. For notational convenience, let δ0c be the identity function on L(c1). For i = 1,...,m, define functions [formula] by

[formula]

and [formula] by

[formula]

Let Xc be the set

[formula]

Finally consider

[formula]

Note that Yc is definable. The idea behind the above definition of Yc is to construct a tuple [formula] such that every e∈L(c1) picks d1∈L(c3) and d2∈R(c3) such that g(c3,d1,d2,e) has the desired value in D. The task of L(c2) is to code where a new tuple begins.

There is [formula] such that Yc  =  A.

We will construct a sequence [formula] of elements in D and three strictly increasing sequences of finite approximations [formula] for i = 1,2,3, where (Li,n,Ri,n) is a finite approximation up to dn and (Li,n,Ri,n) is an extension of (Li,k,Ri,k) for every [formula] with k < n. We will construct these four objects such that they have the following additional properties: for all [formula]

[formula],

dn  ≥  ai,j, for i  ≤  n,j  ≤  m,

and if n  ≥  1 and n = ms + t for some [formula] with 1  ≤  t  ≤  m,

[formula] iff t = 1,

for all [formula],

[formula]

For n = 0, let d∈D be such that d  ≥  a0,t for every t  ≤  m. Let d0 be the smallest element in D larger than d such that f(d0)  <  f(e) for all e∈D with e  ≤  d. Take a∈U such that a > f(d0), but a  <  f(e) for all e∈D with e < d0. Set [formula] and [formula]. By construction of d0, L1,0  =  {d0}. Let (L2,0,R2,0) be the right extension of [formula] up to d0 and let (L3,0,R3,0) be an arbitrary extension of [formula] up to d0 such that both L3,0 and R3,0 are non-empty.

Suppose that [formula] and that dk and [formula] are already constructed for k  <  n and i = 1,2,3 satisfying (I)k, (II)k and, if k  ≥  1, (III)k and (IV)k. Let [formula] be such that n = ms + t with 1  ≤  t  ≤  m. Take d∈D such that

d  >  dn - 1 and f splits between dn - 1 and d and

d >  max {ai,j:i  ≤  n,j = 1,...,m}.

By (II)n - 1, dn - 1 > as,t. By (ii), there are

[formula]

such that g(x, max f(L3,n - 1), min f(R3,n - 1),dn - 1)  =  as,t for all [formula]. Take [formula] and d'∈D larger than d such that

[formula]

We will choose (L3,n,R3,n) as an extension of [formula]. Any such extension will satisfy (IV)n. But first we have to choose dn and (Li,n,Ri,n) for i = 1,2.

Let (L1,n - 1,R) be the right extension of (L1,n - 1,R1,n - 1) up to d'. Let dn be the smallest element in D larger than d' such that

[formula]

Then [formula] extends (L1,n - 1,R) and is a finite approximation up to dn. Set [formula]. Hence this extension satisfies (I)n and dn satisfies (II)n.

If t  ≠  1, let (L2,n,R2,n) be the right extension of (L2,n - 1,R2,n - 1) up to dn. Now suppose that t = 1. Since f splits between dn - 1 and dn, there is a minimal e∈D with dn - 1 < e < dn such that

[formula]

Then [formula] extends (L2,n - 1,R2,n - 1) and is a finite approximation up to e. Let (L2,n,R2,n) be an arbitrary extension of [formula] up to dn. It follows directly that (L2,n,R2,n) satisfies (III)n.

Finally set [formula]. Since dn  ≥  d', (L3,n,R3,n) is an extension of [formula]. As mentioned above, such an extension satisfies (IV)n.

For i = 1,2,3, let ci∈U be the unique element that is approximated by [formula] and let c = (c1,c2,c3). It is left to show that Yc = A. Since [formula] approximates ci, we have by Lemma [\ref=approxcon] that

[formula]

By (I)n,

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] such that n = ms + t with 1  ≤  t  ≤  m. By (III)n,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Since for every [formula]

[formula]

we have for i = 1,...,m

[formula]

By (IV)ms + i,

[formula]

Thus Yc  =  A.

A first application of Theorem A

Let R be an expansion of the ordered field of real numbers [formula]. We will show that in this setting assumption (ii) in Theorem A follows from assumption (i).

For every subinterval of [formula], R defines a bijection between this interval and [formula]. Hence we can assume that U = (0,1). After replacing D by

[formula]

we can assume that f is injective. We now construct a function [formula], definable in R, that satisfies condition (ii) of Theorem A. First let [formula] be given by

[formula]

Note that for fixed [formula] with a < b, the function e  ↦  h(a,b,e) is injective and its image is a subset of the interval (a,b). Then define [formula] such that g(c,a,b,d) is the e∈D≤  d such that |c - h(a,b,e)| is minimal. Since D≤  d is finite, g satisfies condition (ii) in Theorem A.

As a corollary, every expansion of the real field that satisfies the assumption of Theorem E defines [formula]. This was already shown in [\cite=discrete]. Easy modifications of the above proof show that one needs only assume the definability of a homeomorphism between a bounded interval and an unbounded interval rather than the definability of multiplication.

Proof of Theorem C

We deduce Theorem C from Theorem A. For ease of notation, we assume that γ = 1. So let [formula] such that 1,α,β are linearly independent over [formula]. We will now show that [formula] defines multiplication on [formula].

Since for every [formula] the subgroups [formula] and [formula] are definable, we can assume that 1 < α  <  β. For every [formula], let ⌊a⌋β be the largest element in [formula] smaller than a if such an elements exists, and 0 otherwise. Consider [formula] and [formula], where

[formula]

Both f and fα are definable and the images of f and fα are dense in (0,β) by Kronecker's Approximation Theorem (see [\cite=apostol]). Define a function [formula] such that h1(u,d,e) is the minimum of the set of all [formula] such that

[formula]

in other words, given (u,d,e), h1 returns the smallest [formula] such that fα(x) is larger than f(e), but the difference is smaller than u and there is no [formula] such that y  ≤  d and f(y) is between f(e) and fα(x). We will see that given u and d, each [formula] is uniquely determined by the distance between fα(x) and f(e). Define a function [formula] by

[formula]

For fixed [formula] and [formula], it follows directly from the linear independence of 1,α,β over [formula] that the function that maps e to h2(u,d,e) is injective on [formula]. Then let [formula] be defined such that if b > a, g(c,a,b,d) is the [formula] such that

[formula]

is minimal, and g(c,a,b,d) = 1, if b  ≤  a. The function g satisfies condition (ii) of Theorem A.

Hence by Theorem A, every subset of [formula] is definable for every [formula]. Let [formula] be the usual floor function. Since 1 < α, the floor function is injective on [formula]. Thus every subset of [formula] is definable for every [formula]. In particular, both multiplication on [formula] and scalar multiplication by α on [formula] is definable .

We will now show that multiplication by α2 is definable on [formula] as well. Since every subset of [formula] is definable, the map [formula] given by

[formula]

is definable. Thus the function [formula] that maps (n1,n2  +  αm) to n1n2  +  αn1m is definable. Since this function is continuous and [formula] is a dense subset of [formula], the function [formula] that maps (n,a) to na is definable. Fixing α2 in the second coordinate, we get that multiplication by α2 is definable on [formula].

In order to define multiplication on [formula], it is enough to define multiplication on a dense subset of [formula]. We will show that multiplication is definable on the dense subset [formula]. Since (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2, we just need to prove definability of the squaring function. Let [formula]. Since there are unique [formula] such that a  =  n + αm and multiplication by α is definable on [formula], we can define the map a  ↦  (n,m). Since a2 = n2  +  2αnm  +  α2m2 and multiplication by α and α2 is definable of [formula], the squaring function is definable on [formula].

Proof of Theorem D

We have to show that [formula] defines multiplication on [formula]. As before, define a function [formula] such that h1(u,d,e) is the minimum of the set of all [formula] such that

[formula]

and define [formula] by

[formula]

For fixed [formula] and [formula], it follows directly from the Lindemann-Weierstrass-Theorem (for a statement, see [\cite=baker]) that the function that maps e to h2(u,d,e) is injective on [formula]. Then define [formula] to be such that for b > a, g(c,a,b,d) is the [formula] such that |(c - a) - h2((b - a),d,e)| is minimal, and g(c,a,b,d) = 1 for b  ≤  a. Now g satisfies condition (ii) of Theorem A. The definability of multiplication on [formula] follows as in the proof of Theorem C, using [formula] instead of [formula].

A couple of remarks about optimality

1

To our knowledge, there is no documented example of a structure that satisfies condition (i) of Theorem A, but neither condition (ii) nor the conclusion of the theorem. Hence it is not known whether condition (ii) follows from condition (i). While Theorem E shows that this implication holds in the setting of expansions of the ordered field of real numbers, we believe that it fails even for expansions of the additive group.

2

At the moment, we do not fully understand the complexity of the definable sets in [formula]. In particular, we do not know whether the assumption or the conclusion of Theorem A holds for this structure, but we suppose that neither does. We have partial results that this structure defines complicated sets such as Cantor sets and infinitely branching trees. However since these are only partial results and the argument is of different nature than the ones presented in this paper, we decided not to include them here.
