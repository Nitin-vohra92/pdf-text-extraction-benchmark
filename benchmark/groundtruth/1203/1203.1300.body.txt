Level aspect subconvexity for Rankin-Selberg L-functions

Introduction and statement of results

Several authors have recently been successful in implementing the amplification method in order to establish level aspect subconvexity results for Rankin-Selberg convolutions of two (2) forms when one form is fixed and the other form is varying. For example, if f is a Hecke cusp form of fixed level and g is a Hecke cusp form of varying level M, then various bounds of the form

[formula]

for some absolute positive constant δ have been shown by Kowalski-Michel-VanderKam [\cite=KMV], Michel [\cite=M] and Harcos-Michel [\cite=HaM]. Furthermore, results for the Rankin-Selberg convolution of two independently varying forms have been established in the works of Michel-Ramakrishnan [\cite=MR], Feigon-Whitehouse [\cite=FW] and Nelson [\cite=N] in situations where positivity of the central L-values is known. Of particular interest, yet seemingly out of reach by means of current technology, are level and spectral aspect subconvexity results for the Rankin-Selberg convolution of two (2) forms of same level (e.g. when the two forms are same). These L-values appear naturally in many areas of number theory and in particular, have important connections with quantum chaos and equidistribution problems.

Subconvexity bounds for an individual L-function are often the result of sufficient bounds for a weighted average over an appropriate family of L-functions. In this note, we consider the subconvexity problem for the Rankin-Selberg convolution of two varying (2) forms with co-prime levels through the use of a second moment method. With the L-function here being constructed from data associated with two independently varying forms, one has a large collection of natural families to choose from.

The ideas presented here may be applied to other Rankin-Selberg convolutions constructed out of multiple independently varying forms. This is the first installment of recent work by the two authors related to the subconvexity problem and its purpose is to demonstrate the existence of situations in which subconvexity may be established through a second moment average without amplification.

Holomorphic cusp forms

Let N > 0 be an integer and k > 0 be an even integer. We denote by Sk(N) the linear space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight k, level N and trivial nebentypus. Such forms are holomorphic functions on the upper half-plane [formula] satisfying

[formula]

for every [formula] and which vanish at every cusp. Any form f∈Sk(N) has a Fourier series expansion

[formula]

with coefficients ψf(n) satisfying

[formula]

as proven by Deligne [\cite=D].

The space Sk(N) is a finite dimensional Hilbert space with respect to the Petersson inner product

[formula]

We can choose an orthogonal basis Bk(N) for Sk(N) which consists of common eigenfunctions of all the Hecke operators Tn with (n,N) = 1. That is, each f∈Bk(N) satisfies

[formula]

for all (n,N) = 1. Such f are called Hecke eigen cusp forms. The Hecke operators are multiplicative and one has that

[formula]

for any [formula] with (n,N) = 1. In particular, ψf(1)λf(n)  =  ψf(n) if (n,N) = 1. Therefore,

[formula]

if (nm,N) = 1. The Hecke eigenbasis Bk(N) also contains a subset of newforms [formula], those forms which are simultaneous eigenfunctions of all the Hecke operators Tn for any [formula] and normalized to have first Fourier coefficient ψf(1) = 1. For [formula], the Hecke relations [\eqref=Heckerelations] hold for all integers [formula] and it is also known (see [\cite=ILS]) that

[formula]

Rankin-Selberg convolutions of forms with co-prime levels

Let N and M be two positive square-free co-prime integers and let k and κ be two fixed positive even integers. Given two newforms [formula] and [formula], we consider the associated Rankin-Selberg convolution L-function (see [\cite=HaM])

[formula]

where the {αf,i} and {αg,j} are the local parameters of the L-functions associated to f and g respectively and ζ(NM)(2s) is the partial Riemann zeta function with the local factors at primes dividing NM removed. The local parameters satisfy the relations αf,1(p) + αf,2(p) = λf(p) and αf,1(p)αf,2(p) = χ0(p) with χ0 the principal character of modulus N and similarly for the local parameters associated with g. The completed L-function is then defined as

[formula]

where the conductor (see [\cite=M]) is given by [formula] and the local factor at infinity (see [\cite=IK]) is a product of gamma factors

[formula]

The completed L-function satisfies the functional equation

[formula]

The convexity bound for [formula] at the point s = 1 / 2 is

[formula]

for any ε > 0 and may be established in this case simply by the approximate functional equation and Deligne's bound. It has recently been shown by Heath-Brown [\cite=H2], in the general setting of Selberg class L-functions using Jensen's formula for strips, that the ε in the above bound may be removed

[formula]

Furthermore, the general results of Soundararajan [\cite=S] provide a "weak-subconvexity" bound of the form

[formula]

for any ε > 0.

Main results

Our purpose here is to provide level aspect subconvexity bounds for the Rankin-Selberg convolution of two forms of varying levels N and M in situations where both forms are varying at different rates, say N  ~  Mη for some 0 < η < 1. The main point we wish to stress, is that we take advantage of the size of the smaller level N. The method we present here does not produce subconvexity bounds when N = 1 nor when N is the same size as M. Both levels must contribute to the complexity of the problem and they must do so in a manner which is sufficiently distinguishable for the method to work. We restrict to the case of N = P prime to simplify our presentation. Recall that our conductor in this case is of size Q = (PM)2.

We start by reducing our L-function to a smooth sum over Hecke eigenvalues by a standard approximate functional equation argument, see for example [\cite=IK], [\cite=IM], [\cite=M]. Since we are working with newforms of trivial nebentypus, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any positive integer A. The derivatives of W(y) satisfy

[formula]

for any ε > 0. Applying a smooth partition of unity one may derive that (see e.g. [\cite=IM])

[formula]

and h is a smooth function, compactly supported on

[formula]

Preliminaries

Bessel functions

We record here some standard facts about the J-Bessel functions as can be seen in [\cite=W] as well as several estimates for integrals involving Bessel functions which will be required for our application. One may write the J-Bessel functions as

[formula]

where

[formula]

which, when k is a positive integer, one has that

[formula]

Using the above facts leads us to the following results.

Summation Formulae, Large Sieve and the δ-method

Let [formula] be an integer. For any [formula], let S(n,m;c) denote the Kloosterman sum

[formula]

The Kloosterman sums satisfy the Weil bound

[formula]

where τ(c) is the number of divisors of c. This bound is best possible for an individual Kloosterman sum. Sums of Kloosterman sums appear in the following spectral average (see [\cite=IK] for a derivation).

One also has the following large sieve estimate.

The above estimate will be useful in controlling the size of Kloosterman sum moduli. For all remaining moduli we will apply the following analogue to Poisson summation.

We will now briefly recall a version of the circle method introduced in [\cite=DFI] and [\cite=H]. The starting point is a smooth approximation of the δ-symbol. We will follow the exposition of Heath-Brown in [\cite=H].

In practice, to detect the equation n = 0 for a sequence of integers in the range

[formula]

Initial reduction of the second moment

Let M be a positive square-free integer and let P be a prime not dividing M. Let k and κ be two positive even fixed integers. Fix a newform [formula] and choose an orthogonal Hecke eigenbasis Bκ(M) for Sκ(M). Set Q: = (PM)2. Let ε,δ > 0 and choose any [formula]. As seen in the statement of Theorem 1, we are interested in obtaining upper bounds for the sum

[formula]

where [formula] and h is smooth, compactly supported on

[formula]

λ(n) h() ≪ XQ

[formula]

λ(n) h() λ(m)h() J.

[formula]

. Note that D must be of size at least M by the congruence condition. Furthermore, an application of Lemma 5 shows that

[formula]

which is smaller than the bound in Theorem 1 as soon as D > XQ2δ. Therefore, bounding the second moment in [\eqref=secondmoment] has reduced to the following statement.

We emphasize here the significance of the level P in our problem. Note that the first term XQε in the above bound [\eqref=initialbound], which came from the diagonal term after applying the Petersson trace formula in g, beats the convexity bound for Sf(X) by P. If P were fixed, then Lemma 8 would already be insufficient for subconvexity.

Reduction to Shifted Convolution Sums

Let δ > 0. We now proceed with the analysis of Rf,D(X), as defined by [\eqref=offdiagdyadic] above, when [formula] with [formula]. Opening the Kloosterman sums and changing the order of summation, one is left to study

[formula]

As in the works [\cite=HaM], [\cite=KMV] and [\cite=M], an application of Voronoi summation in m and the evaluation of the resulting Ramanujan sums will lead to a collection of shifted convolution sums. Switching from Kloosterman sums to Ramanujan sums in such a manner was already seen in the work of Goldfeld [\cite=G]. Since the application of Voronoi summation will be for a newform f of level P and therefore depends on the divisibility of d by P, we first break apart our d sum as

[formula]

Voronoi summation in m then gives that the inner sum, up to a constant, is equal to

[formula]

This produces a Ramanujan sum over β for each modulus d, which we write as

[formula]

Summing over β will now produce a congruence condition between n and m modulo c. Thus, we have reduced [\eqref=beforeSCS] to the following.

In the above, Id(n,m) determines the main contribution in the sum over n and m which occurs when n  ~  X and m = nL + O(dL(1 + d / X)Qε). The other ranges of summation are negligible as can be seen by Lemma 1.

Proof of Theorem 1

Theorem 1 will follow after an appropriate treatment of the shifted convolution sums Σd(L;c) in Lemma 9. We break this apart into cases according to the value of L.

Treatment of the shifted sums Σd(1;c)

Since we are dealing with forms of level P prime, we only have two types of shifted convolution sums to consider, those with L = P and those with L = 1. In the latter case, the moduli d must be of size at least PM by the congruence condition. Applying Lemma 1 and the bound Id(n,m)  ≪  X min {1,X / d} obtained from Lemma 2 one has that

[formula]

so that this contribution to bounding Rf,D(X) is

[formula]

which matches the first term in [\eqref=initialbound].

Treatment of the zero shift in Σd(P;c)

We now examine the case of L = P and the contribution of the sums

[formula]

to Rf,D(X). We first treat the "zero shift" in the shifted sums Σd(P;c), i.e. when m = nP. One has

[formula]

by using the fact that [formula] (using [\eqref=Fricke]) and again the bound Id(n,nP)  ≪  X min {1,X / d}. This also matches the first term in [\eqref=initialbound]. In fact, for the same reasons, one may also show that

[formula]

However, we will not use this fact in what follows.

Treatment of the non-zero shifts in Σd(P;c)

Finally, we are left with the non-zero shifts

[formula]

By Lemma 1, we need only consider those [formula] with n  ~  X and m = nP + O(dP(1 + d / X)Qε). Therefore, the congruence in the inner sums may be rewritten as an equation

[formula]

We proceed by taking a smooth partition of unity for the sum over m writing

[formula]

where Y runs over values 2v with [formula] such that m = nP + cr is soluble when m  ~  Y and F is supported on ×  [1  /  2,5  /  2]. Furthermore, by Lemma 2 and the support of F, one has that

[formula]

for any non-negative integers i and j. Therefore, we may split apart the sums in [\eqref=asshifts] as

[formula]

which is bounded by

[formula]

through an application of [\eqref=Fbounds] with i = j = 0. For general X and d, this may be bounded by

[formula]

However, in the case of d  ≪  XQ-  δ, one has that m = nP + cr is soluble only when Y  ~  XP so that [\eqref=firstnonzero] then satisfies the stronger bound

[formula]

Therefore, one has the following Lemma.

Since the bound for Rf,D(X) in [\eqref=specialRbound] is better than the convexity bound in [\eqref=secondmomentconvexity] when [formula], we may restrict now to the case of [formula]. The remaining task is to show that one can improve on the bound [\eqref=trivialRbound] by more than [formula] when D is of that size.

For such values of D, an application of Theorem 2 to the shifted convolution sums

[formula]

gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

Hence the contribution of these non-zero shifts to Lemma 9 is bounded by

[formula]

First consider [formula]. In this case, we have that Y  ≪  XPQε and [\eqref=non-zerocontribution] reduces to

[formula]

Next consider [formula]. In this case, we have that Y  ≪  D2PQε / X and [\eqref=non-zerocontribution] reduces to

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=non-zerocontribution1] and [\eqref=non-zerocontribution2] with [\eqref=5.1bound] and [\eqref=5.2bound] in .1, .2 and inserting these bounds into Lemma 8, completes the proof of Theorem 1.

Proof of Theorem 2

Let [formula] and let F be a smooth function supported on ×  [1  /  2,5  /  2] with partial derivatives bounded by

[formula]

for some Z > 0 and [formula]. Let P be a prime, and let k be a fixed positive even integer. For any [formula] we consider the shifted convolution sums

[formula]

with [formula] a fixed non-zero integer satisfying [formula] such that the sum is non-trivial. Detecting the equation [formula] in [\eqref=SCS] through an application of the δ-method gives

[formula]

up to a negligible error term with the function h as in Lemma 7. As mentioned in § 2.2 one expects to take Q to be roughly of size [formula].

Voronoi summation in m

We are now set to treat [formula] in the form seen in display [\eqref=afterdelta]. Since we will be applying Voronoi summation to our sums in n and m, the resulting sums will depend on the divisibility of the moduli q by powers of P. Indeed, an application of Voronoi summation to the m-sum gives, up to a constant factor,

[formula]

where Pq = P / (P,q). Therefore, [\eqref=afterdelta] reduces to

[formula]

Although we have gained the Kloosterman sum structure, an application of the Weil bound here would still be insufficient for our goal.

Voronoi summation in n

Define

[formula]

where Pα = (q,P2), Pq = P / (P,q) and [formula] is the function in Lemma 3. Opening the Kloosterman sum in [\eqref=mVoronoi] and applying Voronoi summation to the n-sum gives, up to a constant factor,

[formula]

where

Application of Weil bound

We now break apart the sums in [\eqref=mnVoronoi] according to the size of q. First, we note that the bound [\eqref=Jbounds] in Lemma 3 allows one to truncate the n and m sums to be of size

[formula]

When the parameters are such that either T1 < 1 or T2 < 1 in [\eqref=nmtruncation], then one has arbitrary saving in these situations. Otherwise, we apply the bound [\eqref=JsaveXbyqQ] from Lemma 3 to Jα(n,m;q) and the Weil bound for Kloosterman sums in order to bound [\eqref=mnVoronoi] by

[formula]

Bounding the minimum by the geometric mean, and using [\eqref=nmtruncation], we get the bound

[formula]

which is dominated by

[formula]

We bound the last expression by

[formula]

Choosing [formula] in [\eqref=second] produces the final bound

[formula]
