Explicit Reconstruction of Homogeneous Isolated Hypersurface Singularities from their Milnor Algebras A. V. Isaev and N. G. Kruzhilin

Introduction

Let On be the local algebra of holomorphic function germs at the origin in [formula] with n  ≥  2. For every hypersurface germ V at the origin (considered with its reduced complex structure) denote by I(V) the ideal of elements of On vanishing on V. Let f be a generator of I(V), and consider the complex associative commutative algebra A(V) defined as the quotient of On by the ideal generated by f and all its first-order partial derivatives. The algebra A(V), called the moduli algebra  or Tjurina algebra  of V, is independent of the choice of f as well as the coordinate system near the origin, and the moduli algebras of biholomorphically equivalent hypersurface germs are isomorphic. Clearly, A(V) is trivial if and only if V is non-singular. Furthermore, it is well-known that [formula] if and only if the germ V has an isolated singularity (see, e.g. Chapter 1 in [\cite=GLS]).

By a theorem due to Mather and Yau (see [\cite=MY]), two hypersurface germs V1, V2 in [formula] with isolated singularities are biholomorphically equivalent if their moduli algebras A(V1), A(V2) are isomorphic. Thus, given the dimension n, the moduli algebra A(V) determines V up to biholomorphism. In particular, if [formula], then V is biholomorphic to the germ of the hypersurface [formula], and if [formula], then V is biholomorphic to the germ of the hypersurface [formula]. The proof of the Mather-Yau theorem does not provide an explicit procedure for recovering the germ V from the algebra A(V) in general, and finding a way for reconstructing V (or at least some invariants of V) from A(V) is an interesting open problem (cf. [\cite=Y1], [\cite=Y2], [\cite=Sch], [\cite=EI]). In this paper we present an explicit method for restoring V from A(V) up to biholomorphic equivalence under the assumption that the singularity of V is homogeneous.

Let V be a hypersurface germ having an isolated singularity. The singularity of V is said to be homogeneous  if for some (hence for every) generator f of I(V) there is a coordinate system near the origin in which f becomes the germ of a homogeneous polynomial. In this case f lies in the Jacobian ideal J(f) in On, which is the ideal generated by all first-order partial derivatives of f. Hence, for a homogeneous singularity, A(V) coincides with the Milnor algebra  On  /  J(f) for any generator f of I(V).

Let Q(z), with [formula], be a holomorphic (m + 1)-form on [formula], i.e. a homogeneous polynomial of degree m + 1 in the variables [formula], where m  ≥  2. Consider the germ V of the hypersurface {Q(z) = 0} and assume that: (i) the singularity of V is isolated, and (ii) the germ of Q generates I(V). These two conditions are equivalent to the non-vanishing of the discriminant Δ(Q) of Q (see Chapter 13 in [\cite=GKZ]). Next, consider the gradient map [formula]. Since Δ(Q)  ≠  0, the fiber [formula] consists of 0 alone; in particular, the map [formula] is finite at the origin. The main content of this paper is a procedure for recovering [formula] from A(V) up to linear equivalence, where we say that two maps [formula] are linearly equivalent if there exist non-degenerate linear transformations L1,L2 of [formula] such that [formula].

In fact, we consider a more general situation. Let pr, [formula], be holomorphic m-forms on [formula] and I the ideal in On generated by the germs of these forms at the origin. Define A: = On / I and assume that [formula], which is equivalent to the finiteness of the map [formula] at the origin (see Chapter 1 in [\cite=GLS]). Observe that since the components of [formula] are homogeneous polynomials, [formula] is finite at 0 if and only if [formula]. In this paper we propose a procedure (which requires only linear-algebraic manipulations) for explicitly recovering the map [formula] from A up to linear equivalence. As explained in Remark [\ref=recognition], this procedure also helps decide whether a given complex finite-dimensional associative algebra is isomorphic to an algebra arising from a finite homogeneous polynomial map as above.

The paper is organized as follows. Reconstruction of [formula] from A is done in Section [\ref=section1]. In Section [\ref=section2] we apply our method to the algebra A(V) arising from Q to obtain a map [formula] linearly equivalent to [formula]. It is then not hard to derive from [formula] an (m + 1)-form Q' linearly equivalent to Q, where two forms Q1, Q2 on [formula] are called linearly equivalent if there exists a non-degenerate linear transformation L of [formula] such that [formula]. Then the germ of the hypersurface {Q'(z) = 0} is the sought-after reconstruction of V from A(V) up to biholomorphic equivalence. We conclude the paper by illustrating our reconstruction procedure with the example of simple elliptic singularities of type [formula].

Reconstruction of finite polynomial maps

Recapping the setup outlined in the introduction, let pr, [formula], be holomorphic m-forms on [formula] and I the ideal in On generated by the germs of these forms at the origin, where m,n  ≥  2. Define A: = On / I and assume that [formula] (observe that [formula]). In this section we present a method for recovering the map [formula] from A up to linear equivalence. Everywhere below we suppose that A is given as an abstract associative algebra, i.e. by a multiplication table with respect to some basis [formula], with [formula].

First of all, we find the unit [formula] of A. One has [formula] where the coefficients [formula] are uniquely determined from the linear system

[formula]

Assume now that [formula] and find the maximal ideal [formula] of A. Clearly, [formula] is spanned by the vectors [formula], [formula], where [formula] are uniquely fixed by the requirement that each ek' is not invertible in A. Hence, for each k the number βk is determined from the condition that the linear system

[formula]

cannot be solved for [formula]. Since system ([\ref=systemmax]) has at most one solution for any βk, this condition is equivalent to the degeneracy of the coefficient matrix Mk of ([\ref=systemmax]). We have [formula], where [formula], with [formula] given by [formula] It then follows that the required value of βk is the (unique) eigenvalue of the matrix Ck.

We are now in a position to find the number of variables n and the degree m for the forms pr. By Nakayama's lemma, [formula] is a nilpotent algebra, and we denote by ν its nil-index, which is the largest integer μ with [formula]. Observe that ν  ≤  N - 1, and therefore to determine ν it is sufficient to compute all products of the basis vectors ek' of length not exceeding N - 1. Further, since A is finite-dimensional, the forms pr form a regular sequence in On (see Theorem 2.1.2 in [\cite=BH]). Hence A is a complete intersection ring, which implies that A is a Gorenstein algebra (see [\cite=B]). Recall that a (complex) local commutative associative algebra B with [formula] is Gorenstein if and only if for the annihilator [formula] of its maximal ideal [formula] one has [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=H]). Lemma 3.4 of [\cite=Sa] yields that [formula] is spanned by the element represented by the germ of [formula].

For every i > 0, let Pi be the vector space of all i-forms on [formula] and Li the linear subspace of A that consists of all elements represented by germs of forms in Pi. Since [formula] consists of all elements of A represented by germs in On vanishing at the origin, the subspaces Li lie in [formula] and yield a grading on [formula]:

[formula]

Since [formula], it immediately follows that [formula] for d: =  max {i:Li  ≠  0}. On the other hand, [formula] is spanned by the element represented by the germ of [formula], which is an n(m - 1)-form. Thus d = n(m - 1). Furthermore, we have

[formula]

Now, observe that

[formula]

i.e. the graded algebra A is standard  in the terminology of [\cite=St]. Hence Li is a complement to [formula] in [formula] for all i > 0. For i = 1 this implies that n can be recovered from the algebra A as

[formula]

(see Remark [\ref=recoverdim]). Next, for i = ν we obtain n(m - 1) = ν (in particular, n divides ν). Thus, the degree m of the forms pr can be recovered from A as follows:

[formula]

Note that since A is given as an abstract associative algebra, finding the grading {Li} from the available data may be hard. We stress that determination of this grading is not required for recovering n and m.

Further, choose an arbitrary basis [formula] in a complement to [formula] in [formula]. Clearly, for some [formula] one has

[formula]

where Zj is the element of L1 represented by the germ of the coordinate function zj, and [formula]. Set

[formula]

and let [formula] be the monomial basis of Pm where [formula]. Next, fix a complement S to [formula] in [formula] and let [formula] be the projection onto S with kernel [formula]. Condition ([\ref=standard]) for i = m then yields that S is spanned by [formula], where [formula]. On the other hand, by ([\ref=dimensions]) we have [formula]. Hence one can find n linear relations

[formula]

where the vectors [formula] are linearly independent.

Further, extracting from ([\ref=relations]) the Lm-components one obtains

[formula]

where [formula]. Identity ([\ref=relations1]) is equivalent to

[formula]

where each qρ(z) is identified with its germ at the origin. From ([\ref=relations2]) one immediately obtains that for some matrix [formula] the following holds:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Thus, the map

[formula]

is linearly equivalent to [formula] as required.

We now summarize the main steps of our algorithm for recovering [formula] from A up to linear equivalence:

[formula]

In the next section this algorithm will be applied to the gradient map arising from a form with non-zero discriminant.

A natural problem is to characterize the algebras that arise from finite homogeneous polynomial maps as above among all complex finite-dimensional Gorenstein algebras. This problem is a special case of the well-known recognition problem  for the moduli algebras of general isolated hypersurface singularities and the corresponding Lie algebras of derivations (see, e.g. [\cite=Y1], [\cite=Y2], [\cite=Sch]). The algorithm presented here can help decide whether a given finite-dimensional Gorenstein algebra B is isomorphic to an algebra A of the kind considered in this section. Indeed, one can attempt to formally apply the algorithm to B. For the algorithm to go through one requires that: (i) the nil-index of the maximal ideal of B be divisible by the number n found from formula ([\ref=dimn]), (ii) for some basis [formula] in some complement to [formula] in [formula] and for some complement S to [formula] in [formula] there exist n linearly independent linear relations among the vectors [formula], with m being the number found from formula ([\ref=formm]), and (iii) the map [formula] produced on Step 9 be finite at the origin. If the algorithm fails (i.e. some of conditions (i)-(iii) are not satisfied), then B does not arise from a finite homogeneous polynomial map. If the algorithm successfully finishes, the resulting map Φ is a candidate map from which B may potentially arise. In order to see if this is indeed the case, one needs to check whether B is isomorphic to the algebra associated to Φ. For this purpose one can use the criterion for isomorphism of finite-dimensional Gorenstein algebras established in [\cite=FIKK].

Reconstruction of homogeneous singularities

Suppose now that [formula] for a holomorphic (m + 1)-form Q on [formula] with Δ(Q)  ≠  0, where Δ is the discriminant. Let Φ be a map linearly equivalent to [formula] produced by the procedure described in Section [\ref=section1] from the algebra A(V), where V is the germ of the hypersurface {Q = 0} at the origin. We then have

[formula]

for some [formula]. Our next task is to recover Q from Φ up to linear equivalence.

Let Q' be the (m + 1)-form defined by Q'(z): = Q(C2z) for all [formula]. Then [formula], and ([\ref=solut1]) implies

[formula]

for some [formula]. For any n  ×  n-matrix D we now introduce the holomorphic differential 1-form [formula] on [formula], where [formula] are the components of the map ΨD: = D  Φ. Consider the equation

[formula]

as a linear system with respect to the entries of the matrix D. Clearly, C- 1 is a solution of ([\ref=system]). Let D0 be another solution of ([\ref=system]) and assume that [formula]. Every closed holomorphic differential form on [formula] is exact, and integrating ΨD0 one obtains an (m + 1)-form Q'' on [formula]. Then [formula], and therefore Δ(Q'')  ≠  0. Furthermore, the Milnor algebras of the germs V' and V'' of the hypersurfaces {Q'(z) = 0} and {Q''(z) = 0} coincide. By the Mather-Yau theorem, this implies that V' and V'' are biholomorphically equivalent and therefore V'' is biholomorphically equivalent to V, which yields that Q'' is linearly equivalent to Q. Thus, any non-degenerate matrix that solves linear system ([\ref=system]) leads to an (m + 1)-form linearly equivalent to Q and a hypersurface germ biholomorphically equivalent to V.

We will now illustrate our method for recovering V from A(V) by the example of simple elliptic singularities of type [formula]. These singularities form a family parametrized by [formula] satisfying t3 + 27  ≠  0. Namely, for every such t let Vt be the germ at the origin of the hypersurface {Qt(z) = 0}, where Qt is the following cubic on [formula]:

[formula]

Below we explicitly show how Qt can be recovered from the algebra At: = A(Vt) up to linear equivalence.

Recall that the starting point of our reconstruction procedure is a multiplication table with respect to some basis. The algebra At has dimension 8 and with respect to a certain basis [formula] is given by (see Remark [\ref=basis] below):

[formula]

It is clear from ([\ref=table]) that [formula] and [formula], where [formula] denotes linear span and [formula] is the maximal ideal of At. We then have [formula], [formula], [formula], hence ν = 3. Further, by formula ([\ref=dimn]) we obtain n = 3, which together with formula ([\ref=formm]) yields m = 2.

We now list all monomials of degree 2 in z as follows:

[formula]

(here K = 6). Next, we let f1: = e2, f2: = e4, f3: = e5, which for f: = (f1,f2,f3) yields

[formula]

Further, define S: = 〈e3,e7,e5 - e8〉. Clearly, S is a complement to [formula] in [formula]. Then for the projection [formula] with kernel [formula] one has

[formula]

The vectors [formula] satisfy the following three linearly independent linear relations:

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

which for [formula] yields

[formula]

It remains to recover Qt from Φ up to linear equivalence. For

[formula]

system ([\ref=system]) is equivalent to the following system of equations:

[formula]

If t  ≠  0 and t3  ≠  216, the only non-degenerate solutions of ([\ref=sys1]) are non-zero scalar matrices. Integrating ΨD for such a matrix D we obtain a form proportional to Qt, which is obviously linearly equivalent to Qt. If t = 0, any non-degenerate solution of ([\ref=sys1]) is a diagonal matrix with non-zero d11, d22, d33. Integrating ΨD for such a matrix D we obtain the form

[formula]

which is linearly equivalent to Q0 = z31 + z32 + z33 by suitable dilations of the variables.

The remaining case t3 = 216 is more interesting. Writing t = 6λ with λ3 = 1, we see that D is a solution of ([\ref=sys1]) if and only if

[formula]

Such a matrix D is non-degenerate if and only if d311 + d331 + d332 - 3λd11d31d32  ≠  0. For example, letting d11 = 0, d31 = 0, d32 = 1 one obtains

[formula]

Integration of ΨD leads to the form Qλ: = λ2z21z2  +  λz1z23 + z22z3. As we have noted above, the Mather-Yau theorem implies that Qλ is linearly equivalent to Qt. Furthermore, the cubic Qλ is equivalent to Q1 by the map (z1,z2,z3)  ↦  (z1  /  λ,z2,z3). Hence each of the three cubics Qλ with λ3 = 1 is linearly equivalent to each of the three cubics Qt with t3 = 216.

This last fact can also be understood without referring to the Mather-Yau theorem, as follows. It is well-known that all non-equivalent ternary cubics with non-vanishing discriminant are distinguished by the invariant

[formula]

where [formula] is a certain classical [formula]-invariant of degree 4 (see, e.g. pp. 381-389 in [\cite=El]). For any ternary cubic Q with Δ(Q)  ≠  0 one has [formula] where j(ZQ) is the value of the j-invariant for the elliptic curve ZQ in [formula] defined by Q. Details on computing [formula] for any Q can be found, for example, in [\cite=Ea]. In particular, [formula] and for the cubic Qt with any [formula], t3 + 27  ≠  0, one has

[formula]

It then follows that each of the cubics Qλ with λ3 = 1 is linearly equivalent to each of the cubics Qt with t3 = 216, as stated above.

One basis in which the algebra At is given by multiplication table ([\ref=table]) is as follows:

[formula]

Note that in our reconstruction of Qt from At above we only used table ([\ref=table]), not the explicit form of the basis.

As was noted in the introduction, a hypersurface germ V with isolated singularity is determined, in general, by the algebra A(V) and the dimension n of the ambient space. We stress that in the case of homogeneous singularities the dimension n can be extracted from A(V) (see formula ([\ref=dimn])).
