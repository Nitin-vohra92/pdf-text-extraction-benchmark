A remark on Zak's theorem on tangencies

Introduction

In this note, we state Zak's theorem on tangencies ([\cite=zak], see also [\cite=zak2]) for non-singular complex varieties in the following way:

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate manifold of dimension n, and let [formula] be a linear subspace of dimension m which is tangent to X along a closed subvariety Y  ⊂  X of dimension r. Then:

[formula]

The former statement appears to have some advantages. The new inequality r  ≤   dim SX - 1 - n is vacuous if the secant variety of X (denoted by SX) fills up [formula], but it is significant when [formula]. For instance, this is always the case if m = N - 1. In this setting, Zak's theorem on tangencies has several consequences (see [\cite=laz] for an account) that can be sharpened thanks to Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Let s: =  dim SX and c: = N - s.

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate manifold of dimension n, and let [formula] denote its dual variety (of dimension n*). The following holds:

The twisted normal bundle [formula] is k-ample for k  ≥  s - 1 - n (cf. [\cite=laz]).

n*  ≥  n + c (cf. [\cite=laz]). In particular, if [formula] then X* is a singular variety.

If s  ≤  2n - 1 (resp. 2n - 2) then every hyperplane section of X is reduced (resp. normal) (cf. [\cite=laz]).

Some examples of manifolds satisfying the equality n* = n (and hence [formula]) are given by hypersurfaces in [formula], Segre embeddings [formula], the Grassmannian [formula] and the 10-dimensional spinor variety [formula]. Moreover, these are the only examples under the additional assumption 3n  ≤  2N by [\cite=ein] (cf. Remark [\ref=rem:ein]). On the other hand, if [formula] we show that furthermore n*  ≥  n + c + 1 and manifolds satisfying the equality are classified, giving a new characterization of the Veronese surface:

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate manifold of dimension n. If [formula] then n*  ≥  n + c + 1, with equality if and only if X is either a curve or the Veronese surface in [formula].

Going one step further, let us consider the next-to-extremal case when [formula]. If n  ≤  3 it is easy to see (cf. Remark [\ref=rem:n^*]) that n* = n + c + 2 if and only if X is either a surface, or a dual defective threefold (i.e. a scroll over a curve), or a secant defective threefold (see [\cite=fuj2] for the classification). On the other hand, for n  ≥  4 we get the following:

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate manifold of dimension n  ≥  4. If [formula] and n* = n + c + 2, then X is a scroll over a manifold W and dim W  ≤  2.

If dim W = 2 we will prove in Theorem [\ref=thm:segre] that the Segre embedding of [formula] is the only scroll as in Theorem [\ref=thm:scroll], so we actually get the following refinement:

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate manifold of dimension n  ≥  4 such that [formula]. Then n* = n + c + 2 if and only if X is either a scroll over a curve, or (an isomorphic projection of) the Segre embedding [formula].

Proofs

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is a consequence of the following application of the Fulton-Hansen connectedness theorem [\cite=f-h]. First, we recall the definition of the relative tangent (resp. secant) variety. Given a subvariety Y  ⊂  X, we define [formula], where [formula] denotes the embedded tangent space to X at y∈Y, and [formula] as the closure of [formula].

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate manifold of dimension n, and let Y  ⊂  X be a closed subvariety of dimension r. Then either dim T(Y,X) = r + n and dim S(Y,X) = r + n + 1, or else T(Y,X) = S(Y,X).

See [\cite=zak2].

We can now prove our results:

Let [formula] be a linear subspace of dimension m which is tangent to X along Y. Then T(Y,X)  ⊂  L, but [formula] as [formula] is non-degenerate. Therefore T(Y,X)  ≠  S(Y,X), and hence r + n =  dim T(Y,X)  ≤   dim L = m by Theorem [\ref=thm:f-h]. But Theorem [\ref=thm:f-h] also yields r + n + 1 =  dim S(Y,X)  ≤   dim SX, so r  ≤   min {m - n,   dim SX - 1 - n}.

If [formula] and m = N - 1, the case we are more interested in, the new bound r  ≤  s - 1 - n is sharp. For example, equality holds for Severi varieties [\cite=zak2] when Y  ⊂  X is an n / 2-dimensional quadric.

According to Theorem [\ref=thm:main], the dimension of the fibres of the second projection of the conormal variety [formula] is bounded by s - 1 - n. So [formula] is k-ample for k  ≥  s - 1 - n. This proves (i). Since dim PX = N - 1, we get n*  ≥  n + c. Assume now that X* is smooth. Then dim (X*)*  ≥  n*  ≥  n + c, and Segre's reflexivity theorem (X*)* = X ([\cite=seg], see also [\cite=kle] for a detailed account) yields c = 0, whence [formula] proving (ii). Part (iii) is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

The main ingredients of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:veronese] are Zak's classification of Severi varieties and Ein's bound on the defect of subcanonical manifolds [\cite=ein]:

Assume n  ≥  2 and n*  ≤  n + c + 1. Let [formula] and δ(X) denote the dual and secant defect of [formula], respectively. As [formula] and δ(X): = 2n + 1 - s, the inequality n*  ≤  n + c + 1 is equivalent to the inequality [formula]. Since we assume [formula], we get δ(X)  ≤  n / 2 by Zak's theorem on linear normality [\cite=zak2] and equality holds if and only if [formula] is a Severi variety. Assume first that the Picard group of X is cyclic. Then [formula] by [\cite=ein], and hence

[formula]

implies that [formula] is a Severi variety with [formula]. So X is the Veronese surface in [formula]. Assume now that the Picard group of X is not cyclic. Then δ(X)  ≤  2 by the Barth-Larsen theorem, as otherwise [formula] could be isomorphically projected into [formula] (see for instance [\cite=laz]). Therefore [formula], whence [formula] by Landman's parity theorem (unpublished, see [\cite=ein]) and [formula] is a scroll over a curve by [\cite=ein]. This yields 1  ≤  δ(X)  ≤  2, contradicting Lemma [\ref=lem:segre].

(i) The bound n*  ≥  n + c given in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is equivalent to the bound [formula]. Furthermore, if [formula] then [formula] by Theorem [\ref=thm:veronese]. To the best of the author's knowledge, these relations involving both dual and secant defects appear to be new.

(ii) For n  ≥  3 the bound obtained in Theorem [\ref=thm:veronese] is equivalent to the bound [formula]. This can be seen as a refinement of the inequality [formula] of Landman and Zak when [formula] (cf. [\cite=zak2]).

(iii) Besides curves and the Veronese surface, the bound n*  ≥  n + c + 2 (or equivalently [formula]) is sharp. Equality holds for surfaces with δ(X) = 0, threefolds with δ(X) = 1, scrolls over curves with δ(X) = 0 and the Segre embeddings [formula] with n  ≥  4. We will prove in the sequel that these are actually the only ones.

The key of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:scroll] is a recent characterization of scrolls among dual defective manifolds obtained by Ionescu and Russo in [\cite=i-r]:

Let n* = n + c + 2, that is, [formula]. If X is a scroll over a manifold W then δ(X)  ≤  2 by the Barth-Larsen theorem. Thus [formula], so dim W  ≤  2. If X is not a scroll, we can assume [formula] by [\cite=i-r] and δ(X)  ≤  (n - 1) / 2 by the classification of Severi varieties. Therefore,

[formula]

yields n  ≤  11 and, in view of Landman's parity theorem, we get [formula]. The first two cases are excluded by [\cite=ein2]. In the third case, X is a Fano manifold of dimension 9 with cyclic Picard group generated by the hyperplane section and index [formula] (see [\cite=ein]), so it is ruled out by Mukai's classification of Fano manifolds of coindex 3 (see [\cite=muk]).

(i) In a similar way, we can prove that a non-degenerate n-fold [formula] with n* = n is either the Segre embedding [formula], or else 4n + 5  ≥  3N and equality holds if and only if X is the 10-dimensional spinor variety [formula]. Since n* = n we deduce [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor:main], and hence δ(X) = 2n + 1 - N. We point out that n* = n is equivalent to [formula]. If X is a scroll then δ(X)  ≤  2, whence [formula]. Therefore [formula], δ(X) = 2 and X is the Segre embedding [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop:scroll]. On the other hand, if X is not a scroll then [formula] and equality holds if and only if X is the 10-dimensional spinor variety by [\cite=i-r]. Thus δ(X)  ≥  (2n - 2) / 3, and hence 4n + 5  ≥  3N, with equality if and only if X is the 10-dimensional spinor variety [formula].

(ii) If n* = n and one furthermore assumes that 3n  ≤  2N (cf. [\cite=ein]) then one also gets hypersurfaces and the Grassmannian [formula], as in [\cite=i-r].

In Theorem [\ref=thm:scroll], if dim W = 2 then [formula] and hence δ(X) = 2, since [formula]. So we conclude in view of Theorem [\ref=thm:segre].

A result on secant defective scrolls over surfaces

In this section we prove the results on scrolls quoted in Section [\ref=sec:proof]. We say that [formula] (or simply X) is a scroll if there exists a vector bundle E over a manifold W such that [formula] and the fibres of the map π:XW  →  W, that we denote by Fw for w∈W, are linearly embedded in [formula]. An equivalent definition of scroll is the following. Let [formula] denote the Grassmannian of k-planes in [formula]. Consider the incidence correspondence [formula] with projection maps [formula] and [formula]. For every subvariety [formula], we denote UW: = π- 11(W) and XW: = π2(UW). Then [formula] is a scroll if and only if W is smooth and π2:UW  →  XW is an isomorphism. The following consequence of Terracini's lemma [\cite=ter] will be useful. Let Σz  ⊂  X denote the entry locus of z∈SX, that is, the closure of the set [formula]. We recall that dim (Σz) = δ(X) for general z∈SX.

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate scroll over W and let z∈SX be a smooth point. If [formula] for every w∈W then [formula].

Let [formula] be the embedded tangent space to SX at z. For every w∈W there exists some [formula], so Fw  ⊂  TxX. Then it follows from Terracini's lemma that [formula]. Since [formula] is non-degenerate we deduce [formula], and hence [formula].

The following lemma is well known. We include a short proof based on Lemma [\ref=lem:useful]:

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate scroll over a curve. If δ(X) > 0 then [formula].

Since dim Σz  =  δ(X) > 0 for general z∈SX and dim W = 1, we deduce that [formula] for every w∈W. Therefore [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:useful].

Let [formula] be an n-dimensional scroll. It follows from the Barth-Larsen theorem that δ(X)  ≤  2. From now on, we will focus on the extremal case δ(X) = 2. On the one hand, if W is a curve then [formula] is the Segre embedding [formula] (see [\cite=kl]). We prove this result in a more geometric and elementary way. The idea of the proof is essentially due to Fyodor Zak:

The only n-dimensional scroll over a curve in [formula] is the Segre embedding [formula].

For every w∈W, let [formula]. Then σw is a hyperplane section of [formula], embedded by Plücker, and w∈σw is a singular point of multiplicity n. The intersection of W and σw is supported at w since π2:UW  →  XW is injective. Moreover, W and σw meet transversally at w since dπ2 is injective. So we deduce that deg XW  =   deg W = mw(σw)  ·  mw(W) = n, where mw(σw) and mw(W) denote the multiplicity of σw and W at w, respectively (see [\cite=ful]). Therefore, for every w∈W there exists a hyperplane section σw in the Plücker embedding of W such that the intersection product σw  ·  W = nw. This property characterizes the rational normal curve of degree n, so [formula] is a non-degenerate (otherwise [formula] for every w'∈W) rational normal scroll of degree n. Consequently, XW is the Segre embedding [formula].

The hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=prop:scroll] can be weakened. Arguing with a general w∈W, the same proof works if [formula] is an integral curve and π2:UW  →  XW is an isomorphism (or even if π2:UW  →  XW has finitely many double points).

On the other hand, if W is a surface there exists a complete classification of scrolls with δ(X) = 2 only for n = 3 (see [\cite=ott] and [\cite=i-t]). We now prove that (an isomorphic projection of) the Segre embedding [formula] with n  ≥  4 is the only scroll over a surface whose secant variety does not fill up the ambient space. The main idea of the proof is to show that [formula] is swept out by a 2-dimensional family of Segre embeddings [formula]. More precisely, we prove that any two fibres of the scroll, Fw and Fw', determine a Segre embedding [formula] in the linear span [formula] that they define.

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate scroll of dimension n over a surface. If δ(X) = 2 and [formula] then X is (an isomorphic projection of) the Segre embedding [formula].

We claim that dim S(Fw,X) = 2n - 2 for general w∈W. Since [formula] for every w'∈W, we get dim S(Fw,X)  ≥  2n - 2. Fix a general z∈SX. We deduce from Lemma [\ref=lem:useful] that [formula] for general w∈W, and hence z∉S(Fw,X). Therefore [formula] proving the claim, as dim SX = 2n - 1. For every w∈W, consider the subvariety [formula]. If dim Gw = 2 for general w∈W then [formula] is a (2n - 2)-dimensional subvariety swept out by a 2-dimensional family of (2n - 3)-dimensional linear subspaces, so [formula] itself is a linear subspace. This contradicts the non-degeneracy of [formula]. Thus dim Gw = 1 for general (and hence every) w∈W. In particular, for every w,w'∈W there exists an integral curve Tww'  ⊂  W such that 〈Fw,Fw'〉  =  〈Fw,Fw''〉 for every w''∈Tww'. So [formula] by Remark [\ref=rem:segre]. Consequently, for every w∈W and every x∈Fw there exists a 1-dimensional family of lines each of them meeting Fw at x and giving a 2-dimensional cone Cx  ⊂  X. Since Fw and Cx are contained in [formula] we deduce deg (Cx) = Cx  ·  Fw. We claim that Cx  ·  Fw' = 1 for every w'∈W, and hence deg (Cx) = Cx  ·  Fw = Cx  ·  Fw' = 1. Let us prove the claim. If Cx  ·  Fw'  ≥  2 then [formula]. Therefore T(Fw,X)  ⊂  〈Fw,Fw'〉, contradicting Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Since deg (Cx) = Cx  ·  Fw = 1, we deduce that [formula] for every x∈Fw and that Cx is a section of π:XW  →  W (in particular, [formula]). Thus X is a scroll over [formula] and [formula], respectively. So [formula] is an isomorphic projection of the Segre embedding [formula].
