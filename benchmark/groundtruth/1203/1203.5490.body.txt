Isometric representations of totally ordered semigroups

Introduction and preliminaries

Within this paper S is a subsemigroup of an additive abelian torsion-free group G with zero. S induces a partial order on G: [formula] if there exists c∈S such that a + c = b. Semigroup S induces full order on G, i.e. for any a,b∈S either [formula] or [formula], if [formula] and [formula]. In this case write S = G+ - a positive cone of G. Each semigroup S, which doesn't contain groups, is contained in some positive cone G+. This follows from the axiom of choice.

Let G be an abelian totally ordered group and S - subsemigroup of G+, which doesn't contain groups. We denote by ΔS a set of unitary equivalence classes of faithful irreducible non-unitary isometrical representations of semigroup S. For V∈ΔS define SV as a semigroup generated by operators Va and V*b, where a,b∈S and Va = V(a).

An inverse semigroup P is a semigroup, such that each element x has a unique inverse element x*, which satisfies the following:

[formula]

We call the representation V∈ΔS inverse, if SV is an inverse semigroup.

In the well-known work [\cite=Coburn] Coburn proved that all isometric representations of semigroup [formula] generate canonically isomorphic C*-algebras. The same was proved by Douglas [\cite=Douglas] for positive cones in [formula] and by Murphy [\cite=Murphy] for positive cones of abelian totally ordered groups. In section 2 we show that every semigroup S has at least one inverse representation. Therefore all faithful isometric representations of positive cone are inverse.

S.A.Grigoryan assumed that all representations in ΔS are inverse if and only if S is a totally ordered semigroup, i.e. S is a positive cone of some group. We prove this hypothesis in section 2.

In section 3 we prove that if S induces full archimedian order on [formula], then it has at least two unitarily not equivalent irreducible isometric representations. In case S induces a total lexicographical-product order, all such representations are unitarily equivalent.

Inverse representations

Regular isometric representation is a map V:S  →  B(l2(S)), a  ↦  Va, defined as follows:

[formula]

C*-algebra generated by regular isometric representation of semigroup S is called a reduced semigroup C*-algebra, denoted by C*red(S) [\cite=Jang].

A finite product of operators of the form Va and V*b, a,b∈S is called a monomial. An index of monomial W = Va1V*a2Va3...V*an is an element of group Γ = S - S, equal to

[formula]

when n is even [\cite=Salahutdinov]. For odd n we have:

[formula]

[formula]

It is clear that

[formula]

Due to definition, monomials form a semigroup, which we denote by SV.

The regular isometric representation of S is inverse.

Consider a family [formula] of elements in l2(S) such that ea(b) = δa,b. This is a natural orthonormal basis in l2(S). Every monomial W in SV satisfies the following:

[formula]

Note that WW* and W*W are monomials also, besides

[formula]

By virtue of Lemma 2.2 in [\cite=Salahutdinov2], WW* and W*W are orthogonal projections. This implies immediately that W = WW*W and W* = W*WW*. Therefore, an inverse element for W is W*.

There exists at least one noninverse representation in ΔS for a semigroup [formula].

Take a regular representation V of S in B(l2(S)), a  ↦  Va. Since S is not equal to G+, there exist incomparable elements c,d∈S, i.e. c - d∉S and d - c∉S. Consider function [formula] in l2(S). Denote by H a Hilbert space generated by linear span of {Vagc,d}a∈S. Note that Vagc,d = gc + a,d + a. Define representation [formula] of semigroup S on H, [formula], by setting [formula], where P:l2(S)  →  H is a projection on H.

This representation is faithful isometric due to its definition.

Let us show that

[formula]

Consider [formula] and find such elements x∈S that

[formula]

To this end, calculate

[formula]

First and last summands are equal to zero, since c and d are incomparabe. Therefore the scale product [formula] is not equal to zero if and only if either a = 0 or a = 2c - 2d. Note that element 2c - 2d may not be contained in semigroup S. Despite this fact we continue the proof assuming 2c - 2d∈S. One can easily see that without this assumption the proof is trivial.

Denote by H0 a Hilbert space in H generated by elements of the following set

[formula]

Repeating the same arguments as above one can show that gc,d and g3c - d,2c - d are mutually orthogonal, and both are orthogonal to H0. Consequently, codimH0 = 2 and the elements gc,d and g3c - d,2c - d form an orthonormal basis in [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

and from equation ([\ref=eq22]) we have

[formula]

For futher be noted, the assumption 2c - 2d∈S implies that 2d - 2c is not contained in semigroup S. Otherwise G+ would contain non-trivial group, which is impossible. Therefore, due to symmetry we get

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Consequently, we get inequality ([\ref=eq11])

The following properties of semigroup S are equivalent

S = G+;

all representations in ΔS are canonically isomorphic;

all representations in ΔS are inverse;

for any representation V in ΔS and for any a,b∈S the following equality is satisfied

[formula]

([\ref=a])⇒  ([\ref=b]) was proved by Murphy [\cite=Murphy].

Let us show implication ([\ref=b])⇒  ([\ref=c]). Suppose all representations in ΔS are canonically isomorphic and S  ⊂  G + . Consider representation V:S  →  l2(G + ), a  ↦  Va, defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is an orthonormal basis in l2(G+). For any a,b,c∈S if [formula] or a = b we have [formula]. Since all elements in G+ are pairwise comparable, we have two cases. If [formula], then operator [formula] is isometric, otherwise ([formula]) operator [formula] is isometric. Consequently, semigroup SV is inverse.

Implication ([\ref=c])⇒  ([\ref=d]) concerns only inverse semigroups, and it was proved in [\cite=Clifford].

Lemma  [\ref=lemma2] implies ([\ref=d])⇒  ([\ref=a]).

The C*-algebras C*(S) and C*red(S) are isomorphic if and only if S is totally ordered, where [formula] is a universal enveloping C*-algebra, generated by all isometric representations of semigroup S [\cite=Murphy2].

In particular case [formula] this statement implies that the algebras [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic. This result was proved by Coburn in his well-known work [\cite=Coburn]. As an example of the converse to this statement take [formula]. Due to Corollary [\ref=cor1], the algebras C*(S) and C*red(S) are not isomorphic. The same was shown in [\cite=Jang2], and this case was studied in details in [\cite=Raeburn].

C*-algebras generated by totally ordered semigroup in [formula]

Consider group [formula]. Total order on G is equivalent to straight line dividing it into two parts. It implies two cases. The first case: the line meets the point (0,0) and doesn't meet any integers. Such line is characterized by equation x + αy = 0, where α is irrational. The second case: the line meets integers, i.e. x + αy = 0, for rational α. The order induced by the first line is archimedian. In the second case we may consider [formula], where [formula] (S = G+). In this case the order cannot be archimedian, since we have ( - 1,1) < (0,1) together with n  ·  ( - 1,1) < (0,1) for any n > 0.

If G+ induces total archimedian order on G, then cardΔS > 1;

If G+ induces lexicographical-product order, then cardΔS = 1.

([\ref=i]) Suppose G+ induces total archimedian order on G. Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula]. Therefore [formula]. Let us give a new representation of semigroup G+.

Consider the Hardi space H2. By the help of inner singular function [formula] define nonunitary faithful isometric representation of the semigroup [formula] in B(H2), t  ↦  Vt, by the following equation:

[formula]

One can easily verify that Vt is an isometric operator on H2. Let us show that this representation is not uquivalent to regular representation.

In case of regular representation W there exists element e0 such that [formula] for any t∈G + . It is sufficient to show that H2 does not contain element g, such that [formula] for any t∈G + . Indeed, suppose that there exists such element g. Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

If t  →  0, the right-hand side of ([\ref=int1]) converges to 1, which leads to a contradiction. Thus, representations V and W are not equivalent.

Now let us prove the second part of the theorem, ([\ref=i2]).

The group of transformations of iteger lattice [formula] is a group [formula]. For any pair of lexicographical-product orders on [formula] there exists an element of [formula], which transforms the first one to the second one. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may consider that S is equal to the following semigroup:

[formula]

Take representation V:S  →  B(H) in ΔS. Since operator V(1,0) is isometric and not unitary, there exists h0∈H such that V*(1,0)h0 = 0. Since V(0,1) = V(1,0)V( - 1,1), we have

[formula]

Therefore, h0 is an initial vector for operators V(0,1) and V(1,0). Consequently, it is initial for any V(n,m), where (n,m)∈S.

Consider Hilbert space H1, generated by linear span of the set

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq32]) implies that the family {V(n,m)h0, (n,m)∈S} forms an orthonormal basis in H1, and

[formula]

Therefore, H1 is an invariant subspace for C*-algebra C*red(S). Since representation V is irreducible, we have H1 = H.

Consequently, the family of vectors en,m = V(n,m)h0, for (n,m)∈S, forms an orthonormal basis of H. This implies immediately [formula].
