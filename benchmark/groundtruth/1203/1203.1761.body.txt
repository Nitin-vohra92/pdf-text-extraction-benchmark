Embedding proper ultrametric spaces into [formula] and its application to nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem

Introduction

Recall that a metric space (X,ρ) is called an ultrametric space if for every x,y,z∈X we have ρ(x,y)  ≤   max {ρ(x,z),ρ(z,y)}. Such spaces naturally appear and have applications in various areas such as number theory, p-adic analysis, and computer science (see [\cite=Lem1], [\cite=Lemin], [\cite=Mo1] [\cite=Mo2]).

Let us briefly review several results with respect to isometric embedding of ultrametric spaces. Timan and Vestfrid [\cite=VeTi] [\cite=VeTi2] proved that any separable ultrametric space embed isometrically into [formula]. Vestfrid [\cite=Ves2] later proved that the result is also true if one replace [formula] by [formula] and c0 by constructing a universal ultrametric space for the class of separable ultrametric space and using its property. Vestfrid [\cite=Ves] also proved that a certain class of countable ultrametric spaces embed isometrically into [formula] for p  ≥  1. Lemin [\cite=Lemin] proved that any separable ultrametric space embed isometrically into the Lebesgue space. He also raised a problem whether any separable ultrametric space embed isometrically into any infinite dimensional Banach space. Motivated by Lemin's problem, Shkarin [\cite=Shk] proved that every finite ultrametric space embeds into every infinite dimensional Banach space. From these results ultrametric spaces have attracted much attention in embedding theory.

In this paper we tackle Lemin's problem in the case where the target Banach space is [formula]. It is already well-known that every separable ultrametric space embeds isometrically into the function space Lp for any p  ≥  1. In fact, it follows from Timan and Vestfrid's result mentioned above and the fact that [formula] embeds isometrically into Lp. Since [formula] does not embed bi-Lipschitzly into [formula] for any p  ≠  2 ([\cite=alkal]), embedding separable ultrametric spaces into [formula] is left as a problem. Our main theorem is the following: Recall that a metric space is proper if every closed ball in X is compact.

Every proper ultrametric space isometrically embeds into [formula] for any p  ≥  1.

The case of general separable ultrametric spaces remains open. A similar method of the proof of Theorem [\ref=MT] also implies an isometric embedding into c0 (see Remark [\ref=rem1]). Our construction of isometric embeddings into [formula], [formula], and c0 is different from the one by [\cite=VeTi] [\cite=VeTi2], [\cite=Ves] [\cite=Ves2] in the case of proper ultrametric spaces.

As an application of Theorem [\ref=MT] we obtain an [formula]-version of nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem, see Section 3.

Proof of the main theorem

We use some basic facts of compact ultrametric spaces (see [\cite=hugh], [\cite=MN112]). Let (X,ρ) be a compact ultrametric space and put [formula]. Consider the relation ~  0 on X given by x  ~  0y [formula] ρ(x,y) < r0. Since ρ is ultrametric ~  0 is an equivalence relation on X. The compactness of X implies that each equivalence class is a closed ball of radius strictly less than r0 (see [\cite=MN112]). Since the distance between two distinct equivalence classes is exactly r0 and X is totally bounded, there are only finitely many equivalence classes, say, [formula], where each Bi is a closed ball of radius [formula]. Note that for any x∈Bi and y∈Bj (i  ≠  j) we have ρ(x,y) = r0. For each i we choose xi∈Bi and fix it. As above for each [formula] we consider the equivalence relation ~  i1 on Bi1 given by x  ~  i1y [formula] ρ(x,y) < ri1. Then we can divide Xi1 into finitely many equivalence classes, i.e., [formula], where Bi1i2 is a closed ball of radius [formula]. We may assume that xi1∈Bi11. For each i1,i2, we choose a point xi1i2∈Bi1i2 so that xi11  =  xi1 and we fix xi1i2. Repeatedly we get a sequence [formula] of partitions of X satisfying the following:

Each [formula] is a closed ball of radius [formula].

If [formula], then [formula].

[formula].

For each [formula] we choose [formula] so that [formula]. The compactness of X yields the following:

[formula].

In particular, [formula] is a countable dense subset of X.

For every closed ball B in X, there exist k and [formula] such that [formula].

We first prove the theorem for compact ultrametric spaces. Let (X,ρ) be a compact ultrametric space and let [formula], [formula], and [formula] as above. Put Nk: =   #  Pk. We consider each coordinate of an element of [formula] is indexed by [formula]. We define a map [formula] as follows: [formula] if [formula] and

[formula]

Note that [formula] for two distinct [formula], [formula].

We define a map [formula] as follows. For each [formula], putting im: = 1 for m > k, we define

[formula]

The right-hand side in the above definition is actually the element of [formula] since

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=fact1]. Note that f is well-defined in the sense that [formula].

We shall prove that f is an isometric embedding. Since [formula] is dense in X this implies the theorem. Taking two distinct elements [formula] and [formula] we may assume that k  ≤  l. Put im: = 1 for m > k. Then we have [formula]. Letting

[formula]

we get [formula] if n  ≥  2 and [formula] if n = 1. Since [formula] for m < n and [formula] for m  ≥  n,

[formula]

This completes the proof of the theorem for compact ultrametric spaces.

Let (X,ρ) be a proper ultrametric space and fix a point x0∈X. For any r > 0 we denote by B(x0,r) the closed ball of radius r centered at x0. For any R > 0 let [formula] be an isometric embedding constructed as in the above way. It suffices to prove that for any R' > R we can construct an isometric embedding [formula] as in the above way, which extends f1 in the following sense: There exists an isometry [formula] such that [formula]. This is possible by the above construction. In fact, keep dividing B(x0,R') as in the above way. Then at finite steps we reach at B(x0,R) by Lemma [\ref=fact2] since B(x0,R') is compact. From the above construction we easily see the existence of f2 and T . This completes the proof of the theorem.

A similar method of the above proof implies new isometric embeddings of proper ultrametric spaces into c0. In fact, let us consider first the case of compact ultrametric spaces. Using the same notation as above, for each k we define [formula] as follows: [formula] if [formula] and

[formula]

Then we define a map [formula] by

[formula]

where as in the above proof we put im: = 1 for m > k. Note that the right-hand side of the above definition is in c0 by Lemma [\ref=fact1]. We can easily check that the map [formula] is an isometric embedding. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=MT] this construction also implies an isometric embedding from every proper ultrametric space into c0.

[formula]-version of nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem

In this section we apply Theorem [\ref=MT] to obtain an [formula]-version of nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem. Refer to [\cite=blmn2], [\cite=ChKa] for the case of finite metric spaces.

We say that a metric space X is embedded with distortion D  ≥  1 in a metric space Y if there exist a map f:X  →  Y and a constant r > 0 such that

[formula]

Dvoretzky's theorem states that for every [formula], every n-dimensional normed space contains a [formula]-dimensional subspace that embeds into a Hilbert space with distortion [formula] ([\cite=Dvo60]). This theorem was conjectured by Grothendieck ([\cite=groth]). See [\cite=Mil71] and [\cite=MilSch96], [\cite=Sch] for the estimate of [formula]. Bourgain, Figiel, and Milman [\cite=BFM86] first studied Dvoretzky's theorem in the nonlinear setting. They obtained that for every [formula], every finite metric space X contains a subset S of sufficiently large size which embeds into a Hilbert space with distortion [formula]. See [\cite=blmn], [\cite=MN07], [\cite=NT] for further investigation. Recently Mendel and Naor [\cite=MN112] [\cite=MN11] studied an another variant of nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem, answering a question by T. Tao. For example they obtained the following: For a metric space X we denote by dim H(X) the Hausdorff dimension of X.

There exists a universal constant c∈(0,  ∞  ) such that for every [formula], every compact metric space X contains a closed subset S  ⊆  X that embeds with distortion [formula] in an ultrametric space, and

[formula]

Note that since every separable ultrametric space isometrically embed into [formula], [formula], and c0 ([\cite=Ves2]), the above S embeds into these spaces.

Applying Theorem [\ref=MT] to Theorem [\ref=MNDV] we obtain the following [formula]-version of nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem:

There exists a universal constant c∈(0,  ∞  ) such that for every [formula], every compact metric space X contains a closed subset S  ⊆  X that embeds with distortion [formula] in [formula], and

[formula]

Mendel and Naor also obtained the following impossibility result for distortion less than 2:

For every α > 0 there exists a compact metric space [formula] of Hausdorff dimension α, such that if S  ⊆  X embeds into a Hilbert space with distortion strictly smaller than 2 then dim H(S)  =  0.

We shall consider an impossibility problem for the [formula]-version of nonlinear Dvoretzky's theorem.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=hanrei] Mendel and Naor used the following result: Let G be the random graph on n-vertices of the Erdös-Reyni model G(n,1 / 2), i.e., every edge is present independently with probability 1 / 2. From G we construct a metric space Wn by assigning the distance between each two vertices of G by 1 if they are joined by an edge, and 2 if they are not joined by an edge. Then the obtained metric space Wn satisfies the following property ([\cite=blmn]). There exists K∈(0,  ∞  ) such that for any [formula] there exists an n-point metric space Wn such that for every δ∈(0,1) any subset of Wn of size larger than 2 log 2n  +  K(δ- 2 log (2 / δ))2 must incur distortion at least 2 - δ when embedded into [formula].

Bartal, Linial, Mendel, and Naor obtained a similar result for the same Wn when considering [formula] instead of [formula] ([\cite=blmn2]). Then Charikar and Karagiozova [\cite=ChKa] improved the result in [\cite=blmn2]: For any δ∈(0,1) and p  ≥  1, there is a constant c(p,δ) depending only on p and δ such that any subset of Wn of size larger than c(p,δ) log n must incur distortion at least 2 - δ when embedded into [formula].

Then applying this result to the proof in [\cite=MN11] implies the following:

For every p  ≥  1 and α > 0, there exists a compact metric space [formula] with [formula], such that if S  ⊆  X embeds into [formula] with distortion strictly smaller than 2 then dim H(S) = 0.

The case of the distortion 2 remains open for any p  ≥  1.
