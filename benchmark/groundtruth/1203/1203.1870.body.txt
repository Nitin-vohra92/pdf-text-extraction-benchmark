A Note on the Lady zenskaja-Babu ska-Brezzi Condition

Introduction

The well known Lady zenskaja-Babu ska-Brezzi (LBB) condition is a particular instance of the so-called discrete inf-sup condition which is necessary and sufficient for the well-posedness of discrete saddle point problems arising from discretization via Galerkin methods. If [formula] denotes the discrete velocity space and Mh the discrete pressure space, then the LBB condition for the Stokes problem states that there is a constant c independent of the discretization parameter h such that

[formula]

The reader is referred to [\cite=GR86] for the basic theory on saddle point problems on Banach spaces and their numerical analysis. Simply put, this condition sets a structural restriction on the discrete spaces so that the continuous level property that the divergence operator is closed and surjective, see [\cite=MR82m:26014] [\cite=MR1880723], is preserved uniformly with respect to the discretization parameter.

In the literature the following condition, which we shall denote the generalized LBB condition, is also assumed

[formula]

here and throughout we assume Mh  ⊂  H1(Ω). By properly defining a discrete gradient operator, the case of discontinuous pressure spaces can be analyzed with similar arguments to those that we shall present. Condition [\eqref=eq:wLBB], for example, was used by Guermond ([\cite=MR2210084] [\cite=MR2334774]) to show that approximate solutions to the three-dimensional Navier Stokes equations constructed using the Faedo-Galerkin method converge to a suitable, in the sense of Scheffer, weak solution. On the basis of [\eqref=eq:wLBB], the same author has also built ([\cite=MR2520170]) an [formula]-approximation theory for the Stokes problem, [formula]. Olshanskiı, in [\cite=MR2833487], under the assumption that the spaces satisfy [\eqref=eq:wLBB] carries out a multigrid analysis for the Stokes problem. Finally, Mardal et al., [\cite=schoberlwinther], use a weighted inf-sup condition to analyze preconditioning techniques for singularly perturbed Stokes problems (see Section [\ref=sec:section5] below).

It is not difficult to show that, on quasi-uniform meshes, [\eqref=eq:wLBB] implies [\eqref=eq:LBB], see [\cite=MR2210084]. We include the proof of this result below for completeness. The question that naturally arises is whether the converse holds. Recall that a well-known result of Fortin [\cite=BF91] shows that the inf-sup condition [\eqref=eq:LBB] is equivalent to the existence of a so-called Fortin projection that is stable in [formula]. In this work, under the assumption that the mesh is shape regular and quasi-uniform, we will show that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is equivalent to the existence of a Fortin projection that has [formula]-approximation properties. Moreover, when the domain is such that the solution to the Stokes problem possesses [formula]-regularity, we will prove that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is in fact equivalent to [\eqref=eq:LBB], again on quasi-uniform meshes.

The work by Girault and Scott ([\cite=MR1961943]) must be mentioned when dealing with the construction of Fortin projection operators with [formula]-approximation properties. They have constructed such operators for many commonly used inf-sup stable spaces, one notable exception being the lowest order Taylor-Hood element in three dimensions. However, [\eqref=eq:wLBB] has been shown to hold for the lowest order Taylor-Hood element directly [\cite=MR2210084]. Our results then can be applied to show that, [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is satisfied by almost all inf-sup stable finite element spaces, regardless of the smoothness of the domain.

This work is organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec:prel] introduces the notation and assumptions we shall work with. Condition [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is discussed in Section [\ref=sec:wLBB]. In Section [\ref=sec:Equiv] we actually show the equivalence of conditions [\eqref=eq:LBB] and [\eqref=eq:wLBB], provided the domain is smooth enough. A weighted inf-sup condition related to uniform preconditioning of the time-dependent Stokes problem is presented in Section [\ref=sec:section5], where we show that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] implies it. Some concluding remarks are provided in Section [\ref=sec:conclusion].

Preliminaries

Throughout this work, we will denote by [formula] with d = 2 or 3 an open bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. If additional smoothness of the domain is needed, it will be specified explicitly. L2(Ω), H1(Ω) and H10(Ω) denote, respectively, the usual Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces. We denote by [formula] the set of functions in L2(Ω) with mean zero. Vector valued spaces will be denoted by bold characters.

We introduce a conforming triangulation Th of Ω which we assume shape-regular and quasi-uniform in the sense of [\cite=BF91]. The size of the cells in the triangulation is characterized by h > 0. We introduce finite dimensional spaces [formula] and [formula] which are constructed, for instance using finite elements, on the triangulation Th. For these spaces, the inverse inequalities

[formula]

and

[formula]

hold, see [\cite=BF91]. Here and in what follows we denote by c will a constant that is independent of h.

We shall denote by [formula] the so-called Scott-Zhang interpolation operator ([\cite=SZ90]) onto the velocity space and we recall that

[formula]

and

[formula]

The Scott-Zhang interpolation operator onto the pressure space [formula] can be defined analogously and satisfies similar stability and approximation properties. We shall denote by [formula] the [formula]-projection onto [formula] and by Π0:L2(Ω)  →  L2(Ω) the L2-projection operator onto the space of piecewise constant functions, i.e.,

[formula]

For one result below we shall require full [formula]-regularity of the solution to the Stokes problem:

Assumption [\ref=assumption1] is known to hold in two and three dimensions (d = 2,3) whenever Ω is convex or of class C1,1, see [\cite=MR977489].

By suitably defining a discrete gradient operator acting on the pressure space, the proofs for discontinuous pressure spaces can be carried out with similar arguments.

We introduce the definition of a Fortin projection.

An operator [formula] is called a Fortin projection if F2h  =  Fh and

[formula]

We shall be interested in Fortin projections Fh that satisfy the condition:

[formula]

or

[formula]

Let us remark that the approximation property [\eqref=eq:fl2] implies [formula]-stability.

If an operator [formula] satisfies [\eqref=eq:fl2] then it is [formula]-stable, i.e., [\eqref=eq:fh1] is satisfied.

The proof relies on the stability and approximation properties [\eqref=eq:SZprop] of the Scott-Zhang operator and on the inverse estimate [\eqref=eq:invX], for if [formula],

[formula]

Conclude using the [formula]-approximation properties of the operators Fh and Ch.

Girault and Scott, [\cite=MR1961943], explicitly constructed a Fortin projection that satisfies [\eqref=eq:fh1] and [\eqref=eq:fl2] for many commonly used spaces. In fact, they showed that the approximation is local, i.e.,

[formula]

where N(T) is a patch containing T. In particular, they have shown the existence of this projection for the Taylor-Hood elements in two dimensions. In three dimensions they proved this result for all the Taylor-Hood elements except the lowest order case.

In this work we shall prove the implications

[formula]

thus showing that, in our setting, all these conditions are indeed equivalent. The top equivalence is well-known, see [\cite=BF91] [\cite=GR86] [\cite=MR2050138]. The left implication is also known (see [\cite=MR2210084]), for completeness we show this in Theorem [\ref=thm:wlbbimpllbb]. The bottom implications, although simple to prove, seem to be new.

The Generalized LBB Condition

Let us begin by noticing that the generalized LBB condition [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is actually a statement about coercivity of the [formula]-projection on gradients of functions in the pressure space. Namely, [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is equivalent to

[formula]

It is well known that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] implies [\eqref=eq:LBB]. For completeness we present the proof. We begin with a perturbation result.

There exists a constant c independent of h such that, for all qh∈Mh, the following holds:

[formula]

The proof relies on the properties [\eqref=eq:SZprop] of the Scott-Zhang interpolation operator Ch,

[formula]

conclude using [\eqref=eq:SZprop].

On the basis of Lemma [\ref=lem:verfurth] we can readily show that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] implies [\eqref=eq:LBB]. Again, this result is not new and we only include the proof for completeness.

[\eqref=eq:wLBB] implies [\eqref=eq:LBB].

Since we assumed that [formula], the proof is straightforward:

[formula]

where, in the last step, we used the inverse inequality [\eqref=eq:invX]. This, in conjunction with Lemma [\ref=lem:verfurth] and the characterization [\eqref=GLBBb], implies the result.

Let us now show that the generalized LBB condition [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is equivalent to the existence of a Fortin operator satisfying [\eqref=eq:fl2]. We begin with a modification of a classical result.

For all p∈H1(Ω) there is [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let p∈H1(Ω) and T∈Th. Clearly,

[formula]

A classical result ([\cite=MR82m:26014] [\cite=MR1846644] [\cite=GR86] [\cite=MR1880723]) implies that there is a [formula] with [formula] in T and

[formula]

Given that the mesh is assumed to be shape regular, by mapping to the reference element it is seen that the constant in the last inequality does not depend on T∈Th.

Let [formula] be defined as v|T  =  vT for all T in Th. By construction,

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

The first equality is by definition; then we applied the Poincaré-Friedrichs inequality (since [formula]); next we used the properties of the function vT and the approximation properties of the projector Π0.

With this result at hand we can prove the following.

If there exists a Fortin operator Fh that satisfies [\eqref=eq:fl2], then [\eqref=eq:wLBB] holds.

Let qh∈Mh. Using the properties of the operator Π0 and the local analogue of the inverse inequality [\eqref=eq:invM], we get

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem:tartarwithh] we know there exists [formula] with [formula] and

[formula]

hence

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from integration by parts over each T and using the fact that v|∂T  =  0 (see Lemma [\ref=lem:tartarwithh]).

Using the existence of the operator Fh,

[formula]

It remains to show that

[formula]

For this purpose, we use the approximation property [\eqref=eq:fl2] and Lemma [\ref=lem:tartarwithh]

[formula]

where the last inequality holds because of [\eqref=eq:saves].

The converse of Theorem [\ref=thm:fl2implwlbb] is given in the following.

If [\eqref=eq:wLBB] holds, then there exists a Fortin projector Fh that satisfies [\eqref=eq:fl2].

Let [formula]. Define [formula] as the solution of

[formula]

Notice that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] provides precisely necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem to have a unique solution.

Define Fhv: = zh we claim that this is indeed a Fortin projection that satisfies [\eqref=eq:fl2]. By construction, [\eqref=eq:Fortin] holds (see the second equation in [\eqref=eq:l2stokes]). To show that this is indeed a projection, assume that [formula] in [\eqref=eq:l2stokes], setting wh  =  zh  -  vh we readily obtain that

[formula]

It remains to show the approximation properties of this operator. We begin by noticing that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] implies

[formula]

where we used [\eqref=eq:l2stokes]. To obtain the approximation property [\eqref=eq:fl2] we use the Scott-Zhang interpolation operator Ch,

[formula]

We bound the first term using the approximation property [\eqref=eq:SZprop] of Ch. To bound the second term we use problem [\eqref=eq:l2stokes] with wh  =  Fhv  -  Chv, then

[formula]

we conclude applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and using [\eqref=eq:boundgradp].

Smooth Domains

Here we show that, provided [\eqref=eq:LBB] holds and, moreover, the domain Ω is such that Assumption [\ref=assumption1] is satisfied, then [\eqref=eq:fl2] holds and hence [\eqref=eq:wLBB] holds as well. This is shown in the following.

Assume the domain Ω is such that the solution to [\eqref=eq:contstokes] possesses [formula]-elliptic regularity, i.e., Assumption [\ref=assumption1] holds. Then [\eqref=eq:LBB] implies that there is a Fortin operator Fh that satisfies [\eqref=eq:fl2].

Let [formula]. Define [formula] as the solution to the discrete Stokes problem

[formula]

where, in [\eqref=eq:stokes], the colon is used to denote the tensor product of matrices. Notice that [\eqref=eq:LBB] implies that this problem always has a unique solution.

Set Fhv: = zh. Proceeding as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:wlbbimplfl2] we see that this is indeed a projection. Moreover, [\eqref=eq:Fortin] holds by construction. It remains to show that [\eqref=eq:fl2] is satisfied. To this end, analogously to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:wlbbimplfl2], we notice that [\eqref=eq:LBB] implies

[formula]

We now argue by duality. Let ψ and φ solve [\eqref=eq:contstokes] with f = Fhv - v. Assumption [\eqref=eq:Cattabriga] then implies

[formula]

Notice that since Ihθ∈Mh, [formula]. Since [formula], using [\eqref=eq:stokes], the estimate for ph, [\eqref=eq:SZh1] and [\eqref=eq:Cattabriga],

[formula]

A direct application of of [\eqref=eq:SZh1], [\eqref=eq:SZprop] and [\eqref=eq:Cattabriga] allows us to obtain the following estimates:

[formula]

We conclude using a stability estimate for [\eqref=eq:stokes]

[formula]

which, given [\eqref=eq:LBB], is uniform in h.

The Weighted LBB condition

In relation to the construction of uniform preconditioners for discretizations of the time dependent Stokes problem, Mardal, Schöberl and Winther, [\cite=schoberlwinther], consider the following inf-sup condition,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

By constructing a Fortin projection operator that is [formula]-bounded they have showed, on quasi-uniform meshes, that the inf-sup condition [\eqref=eq:winf-sup] holds for the lowest order Taylor-Hood element in two dimension. In addition, they proved the same result, on shape regular meshes, for the mini-element. Here, we show that [\eqref=eq:winf-sup] holds if we assume [\eqref=eq:wLBB]. A simple consequence of this result is that, on quasi-uniform meshes, [\eqref=eq:winf-sup] holds for any order Taylor-Hood elements in two and three dimensions.

Let Ω be star shaped with respect to ball. If the spaces [formula] and Mh are such that [\eqref=eq:wLBB] is satisfied, then the inf-sup condition [\eqref=eq:winf-sup] holds with a constant that does not depend on ε or h.

We consider two cases: ε  ≥  h and ε  <  h.

Given that the domain Ω is star shaped with respect to a ball, we can conclude ([\cite=schoberlwinther]) that the following continuous inf-sup condition holds,

[formula]

with a constant c independent of ε.

We first assume that ε  ≥  h. Using [\eqref=conweight] for qh∈Mh we have,

[formula]

where we used that, since [\eqref=eq:wLBB] holds, Theorem [\ref=thm:wlbbimplfl2] shows that there exists a Fortin operator Fh that satisfies [\eqref=eq:Fortin]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:fl2implfh1] and the approximation properties [\eqref=eq:fl2] of the Fortin operator,

[formula]

where we used that h  ≤  ε.

On the other hand, if ε  <  h we use q1  =  qh and q2  =  0 in the definition of the weighted norm for the pressure space. Condition [\eqref=eq:wLBB] then implies

[formula]

By the inverse inequality [\eqref=eq:invX],

[formula]

Conclude using that ε  <  h.

Concluding Remarks

There seems to be one main drawback to our methods of proof. Namely, all our results rely heavily on the fact that we have a quasi-uniform mesh. However, at the present moment we do not know whether this condition can be removed. Finally, it will be interesting to see if [\eqref=eq:LBB] is in fact equivalent to [\eqref=eq:wLBB] on domains that do not satisfy the regularity assumption [\eqref=eq:Cattabriga] (e.g. non convex polyhedral domains).

On the other hand, it seems to us that condition [\eqref=eq:wLBB] must be regarded as the most important one. Our results show that, under the sole assumption that the mesh is quasi-uniform, this condition implies the classical condition [\eqref=eq:LBB] (Theorem [\ref=thm:wlbbimpllbb]). Moreover, as shown in Theorem [\ref=thm:wlbbimplweightlbb], this condition implies the weighted inf-sup condition [\eqref=eq:winf-sup] on quasi-uniform meshes.
