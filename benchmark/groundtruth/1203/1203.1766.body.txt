Unitals of PG(2,q2) containing conics

Introduction

Let PG(2,q), q = ph, p a prime, denote the Desarguesian projective plane of order q. A maximal arc of degree n is a set of points of PG(2,q) meeting every line in either 0 or n  ≤  q points. For example, a point or the complement of a line are maximal arcs; these are called trivial maximal arcs. In [\cite=bbm] it was proved that no non-trivial maximal arc exists in PG(2,q), with q odd. Instead, in [\cite=d], Denniston constructed maximal arcs in PG(2,q), q even, each of which is the union of irreducible conics from a partial pencil plus their common nucleus [\cite=d].

In [\cite=t1] [\cite=t2] J.A. Thas constructed two classes of maximal arcs of PG(2,q), q even. In [\cite=hp] it was proved that some of the maximal arcs in the first class as well as all maximal arcs of the second class are of Denniston type. Many years later, Mathon studied the following problem:

Do there exist other maximal arcs in PG(2,q), each of which is the union of conics plus their common nucleus?

In his paper [\cite=m] he gave a positive answer by constructing the Mathon maximal arcs.

In this paper we deal with a similar problem about unitals of PG(2,q2).

A unital in PG(2,q2) is a set U of q3 + 1 points such that each line meets U in 1 or q + 1 points. A line of PG(2,q2) is a tangent or secant line to U according if it contains 1 or q + 1 points of U. Through each point of U, there is exactly one tangent and q2 secants to U, while through each point not in U, there are q + 1 tangents and q2 - q secant lines.

An example of a unital is given by the set of absolute points of a non-degenerate unitary polarity of PG(2,q2). This is a classical or Hermitian unital.

In [\cite=b] [\cite=m] Buekenhout and Metz constructed non-classical unitals by using the Andrè/Bruck-Bose representation of PG(2,q2) in PG(4,q) for q > 2. These unitals are Buekenhout-Metz unitals. In [\cite=be] [\cite=hs] a nice geometric description in PG(2,q2), q odd, was given for some of these unitals. For a∈GF(q2), consider the conic Ca with equation 2yz - x2 + az2 = 0. The set {Ca:a∈GF(q2)} is a hyperosculating pencil with base point (0,1,0). Let t be a fixed non-square of GF(q2). Then the set

[formula]

turns out to be a Buekenhout-Metz unital that we call of Baker-Ebert-Hirschfeld-Sznyi type or BEHS-type for short. The following question arises:

Do there exist other unitals of PG(2,q2) which are unions of conics?

The answer is negative.

Let U be a unital of PG(2,q2) and suppose that U is a union of conics. Then q is odd and U is a Buekenhout-Metz unital of BEHS-type.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th_2]

Let U be an unital of PG(2,q2) and let C be an irreducible conic contained in U. For every point P of C, the tangent at P to C coincide with the tangent at P to U .

For q even, the tangents to C all contain a common point N, the nucleus of C, [\cite=h]. Thus there would be q2 + 1 tangents to U on N, a contradiction. Hence, we conclude that if U contains an irreducible conic, then q must be odd.

From now on, q is an odd prime power and U a union of irreducible conics.

In [\cite=pr] Penttila and Royle gave a complete classification of two-intersection sets in the projective planes of order 9. From this classification, the Buekenhout-Metz unitals of BEHS-type are the only unitals in PG(2,9) containing conics. Thus we may assume q > 3.

In PG(2,q), equipped with the homogeneous coordinates (x,y,z), any conic C is defined by the equation

[formula]

and the associated symmetric matrix is

[formula]

The rank of C is the rank of the matrix A(C). Conics of rank 3 are said to be irreducible or non-singular. Singular conics are of two types: a pair of distinct lines (when the associated matrix has rank 2) and a repeated line (when the associated matrix has rank 1).

If C is irreducible, the points that are not in C split in two sets: the set [formula] of external points, lying on two tangents to C and the set [formula] of internal points, lying on no tangent to C.

[\cite=s] Let C:f(x,y,z) = 0 be a irreducible conic of PG(2,q), q odd. Then a point (x,y,z) is in [formula] if and only if -   det(A(C))  ·  f(x,y,z) is a non-zero square in GF(q).

Fix an irreducible conic C in PG(2,q). In [\cite=afkl], irreducible conics such that the points not in C are all in [formula] are described. More precisely, the following theorem is proved.

Let C and D be two irreducible conics of PG(2,q),  q odd, q  ≥  17, such that [formula] has empty intersection with [formula]. Then the points of [formula] consists entirely of internal points of D and one of the following cases occur:

[formula], C and D being two conics of a bitangent pencil at P and at Q;

[formula], C and D being two conics of a bitangent pencil at P and at Q, the two common points of C and D in the quadratic extension PG(2,q2) of PG(2,q);

[formula], C and D being two conics of a hyperosculating pencil at P.

It is worth pointing out that all the above pencils contain a conic of rank 1.

The stabilizer of C in the group PGL(3,q) of the linear collineations of PG(2,q) has three orbits on points of PG(2,q), namely, C itself, [formula] and [formula]. Dually, there are three orbits on lines, namely, the tangent lines to C, the secant lines to C and the external lines to C. Since every line of PG(2,q) can be viewed as a conic of rank 1, we can fix a projective frame such that the conic C and the pencils in Theorem [\ref=th_1] have the following forms.

C is the hyperbola 2xy = z2 and the pencil consists of the conics in the family 2xy = kz2, k∈GF(q), plus the repeated line z2 = 0. The points P and Q are the points at infinity of C.

C is the circle x2  -  αy2 = z2 where α is a fixed non-square of GF(q) and the pencil consists of the conics in the family x2  -  αy2 = kz2, k∈GF(q), plus the repeated line z2 = 0. The points P and Q are the points at infinity of C in PG(2,q2).

C is the parabola 2yz = x2 and the pencil consists of the conics in the family 2yz = x2 + kz2, k∈GF(q), plus the repeated line z2 = 0. The point P is the point at infinity of C.

Assume now that C is contained in U. Since every tangent to C is also a tangent to U we see that [formula] is contained in [formula].

In what follows we will use the representation of conics of PG(2,q) as points of PG(5,q). We also recall some relevant properties of the Veronese surface of PG(5,q). For a fuller treatment we refer the reader to [\cite=ht].

If the 5-dimensional projective space PG(5,q) is equipped with the homogeneous coordinates (a11,a22,a33,a12,a13,a23), the conic C with equation ([\ref=eq_1]) defines the point P(C) = (a11,a22,a33,a12,a13,a23) of PG(5,q), and conversely. Under this 1-1 correspondence, the set of singular conics defines the hypersurface with equation  det(A) = 0 of PG(5,q), where A is the matrix associated with the generic conic C, and the set of rank 1 conics defines the Veronese surface

[formula]

It is also easy to check that the representations in PG(5,q) of the pencils of conics of type (i), (ii), (iii), are lines intersecting the Veronese surface V at P = (0,0,1,0,0,0). Further, every conic C with rank > 1 determines the cone Γ(C) projecting V from P(C).

If D is a second conic in U, then [formula] has empty intersection with [formula]. This implies that the pencil determined by C and D in PG(2,q2) is one of those described in Theorem [\ref=th_1]. We also observe the symmetric relationship between the conics C and D: if all points of [formula] are in [formula] then all points of [formula] are in [formula].

It is clear that the cones Γ(C) and Γ(D) share the line P(C)P(D) and V. By Theorem [\ref=th_1], for every other conic E contained in U the point P(E) is contained in the intersection of the cones Γ(C) and Γ(D).

Since U does not contain lines of PG(2,q2), then no point of V represents a conic contained in U. Hence we are reduced to studying which point in [formula] represents a conic in U. We will do this by considering the above three cases for the pencil defined by C and D.

Case 1. C:2xy = z2 and D:2xy = kz2 for some [formula].

The intersection points between C and D are P = (1,0,0) and Q = (0,1,0). Further, we have  det(A(C)) = 1 and  det(A(D)) = k. By Theorem [\ref=th_3], every point of [formula] is in [formula] if and only if k - 1 is a non-square in GF(q2). By the symmetric relationship between the conics C and D, we have that k(k - 1) is a non-square of GF(q2). Hence, k is a non-zero square of GF(q2).

We first consider the irreducible conics of the pencil defined by C and D. If E:2xy = hz2, h  ≠  1,k, is contained in U, then h is a non-zero square in GF(q2) and h - 1, h - k are non-squares in GF(q2). Hence such a set of conics determines a subset X of GF(q2) such that 1∈X, all elements of X are non-zero squares and for any h,k∈X, h - k is a non-square.

Let X be a subset of GF(q2) of non-zero squares with the property that the difference of any two elements is always a non-square. Then X has at most (q + 1) / 2 elements.

As usual we represent GF(q2) as the affine plane AG(2,q). The lines of this plane are subsets of GF(q2) with the property that the difference of two elements is either always a square, or always a non-square, depending only on slope of the line. Thus the lines are partitioned into two classes, square type S and non-square type N. Through each point of AG(2,q) there pass (q + 1) / 2 lines of S and (q + 1) / 2 lines of N. Hence, on an arbitrary line L of S not passing through the origin O, there are (q + 1) / 2 non-squares, since the line parallel to L containing the origin is also in S.

Let A and B two distinct points of X collinear with the origin. Then A - B is always a square, a contradiction. This implies that on each line of type S on O there is at most one point of X. Then X contains at most (q + 1) / 2 points.

A consequence of this lemma is that the conics of the pencil defined by C and D cover at most 2 + (q2 - 1)(q + 1) / 2 points of U. Since q > 3, in order to cover the remaining points of U we need more then one conic not in the pencil defined by C and D. So we investigate [formula].

It is easily seen that the points of Γ(C) and Γ(D) not in the surface V are

[formula]

It is worth pointing out that the points of the line P(C)P(D) are those for which (a,b,c) = (a',b',c') = (0,0,1). Further, we get P(C) and P(D) also for s = 0 and t = 0, respectively. In the following we assume (a,b,c)  ≠  (0,0,1)  ≠  (a',b',c') and [formula].

Then the points in [formula] satisfy the following equations:

[formula]

for some ρ∈GF(q2)*.

First we consider [formula]. From Equations ([\ref=eq_2]), we get a'b'c'  ≠  0 and

[formula]

This implies that the generator with base point (a,b,c) of Γ(C) meets Γ(D) on V. Hence there are no points in [formula] with [formula].

Now suppose that a = 0 and [formula]. Equations ([\ref=eq_2]) reduce to

[formula]

It follows immediately that a' = 0 and [formula]; hence we get the same conclusion as before.

The same reasoning applies to the case b = 0 and [formula].

If c = 0 and [formula], Equations ([\ref=eq_2]) reduce to

[formula]

As [formula] we have [formula], c' = 0 and ρ = k- 1. We can assume that a = 1 = a'. Thus Equations ([\ref=eq_3]) reduce to

[formula]

Since b2 = b'2, we have either b = b' or b =  - b'. If b = b' we get k = 1, a contradiction. Hence b =  - b'. Then t = (1 - k) / 2b' and it is easy to check that the cones Γ(C) and Γ(D) share the points PEb' = (1 - k,(1 - k)b'2,2kb', - (k + 1)b',0,0)), b'∈GF(q2). We note that the conic

[formula]

has rank 3 for all b'.

We proceed by considering separately the cases b' a non-square and b' a non-zero square.

Let b' be a non-square of GF(q2). As k(k - 1) is a non-square, we see that the line x = 0 intersects Eb' in (0,,1), with [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=th_3], we have that (0,,1) is in [formula]. Then Eb' cannot be contained in U.

We now turn to the case b' a non-zero square. Assume that Eb' is contained in U. As q > 3, U contains another conic [formula]. By applying the same reasoning to [formula], we get

[formula]

Since Eb' and Eb'' are contained in U, they define one of the pencils in Theorem [\ref=th_1]. This implies that the line defined by P(Eb') and P(Eb'') in PG(5,q) should intersect the surface V. But we will see that this is not the case.

To simplify calculations, we apply the collineation

[formula]

of PG(2,q2).

Then σ takes Eb' to E1 and Eb'' to and Eβ, with [formula]. The line of PG(5,q) defined by

[formula]

intersects V if and only if

[formula]

for some l,m,n∈GF(q2), (l,m,n)  ≠  (0,0,0), and s,ρ∈GF(q2)*; we recall that [formula]. In the following we use Equations ([\ref=eq_6]).

Assume n = 0 and [formula]. Then 1 + sβ = 0 and this implies that ρlm = 0, a contradiction. Assume n = 0 = l. Without loss of generality we may assume m = 1. Then s =  - 1 and β = 1, a contradiction. Assume n = 0 = m. Without loss of generality we may assume l = 1. Then 1 + sβ = 0. Hence sβ =  - 1. These forces β = 1, a contradiction. Assume l = 0 = m. Without loss of generality we may assume n = 1. Then s =  - 1 and β =  - 1. This forces k =  - 1 which contradicts the fact that k - 1 has to be a non-square in GF(q2). This proves that U cannot contain the conic Eb'', a contradiction.

We leave it to the reader to verify that, when (a,b,c) is either (0,1,0) or (1,0,0), there are no points in [formula].

Hence, we have proved that there is at most one conic E not in the pencil defined by C and D that can be contained in U. From Lemma [\ref=lem_1], we get that does not exist a unital U which is union of irreducible conics with two conics defining a pencil of type (i).

Case 2. C:x2  -  αy2 = z2 and D:x2  -  αy2 = kz2 for a fixed non-square α∈GF(q2) and some [formula].

The conics C and D have empty intersection in PG(2,q2). Further, we have  det(A(C)) = α and  det(A(D)) = αk. By Theorem [\ref=th_3], every point of [formula] is in [formula] if and only if k - 1 is a non-zero square in GF(q2). By the symmetric relationship between the conics C and D, we have that k(k - 1) is non-zero square in GF(q2). Hence k must be a non-zero square of GF(q2).

We now proceed similarly to the previous case. We first consider the irreducible conics of the pencil defined by C and D. We point out that these conics are disjoint in PG(2,q2). As q2 + 1 does not divide q3 + 1 we see that U must contain a further conic not in the pencil. So we investigate [formula].

It is easily seen that the points of Γ(C) and Γ(D) not in the surface V are

[formula]

As in the previous case, we have (a,b,c)  ≠  (0,0,1)  ≠  (a',b',c') and [formula].

Then, the points in [formula] satisfy the following equations:

[formula]

for some ρ∈GF(q2)*.

First we consider [formula]. As in Case 1, from the above equations, we get that there are no points in [formula] with [formula].

Now suppose that a = 0 and [formula]. Equations ([\ref=eq_8]) reduce to

It follows immediately that a' = 0 and [formula]; hence we get the same conclusion as before. The same reasoning applies to the case b = 0 and [formula].

If c = 0 and [formula], Equations ([\ref=eq_8]) reduce to

[formula]

As [formula] we have [formula], c' = 0 and ρ = k- 1. We can assume that a = 1 = a'. Thus Equations ([\ref=eq_9]) reduce to

[formula]

From the first and third equation of ([\ref=eq_10]) we get

[formula]

By substituting these expressions into the second equation of (), we get

[formula]

By substituting a = 1, c = 0, ρ = k- 1 and ([\ref=eq_11]) into Equations ([\ref=eq_9]), we get that [formula] consists of the points

[formula]

with b∈GF(q2)*.

In order for Eb,k to be a conic in U, the sets [formula] and [formula] should be both contained in [formula]. By using Theorem [\ref=th_3], with straightforward calculations we obtain that the point (1,0,1) of C is in [formula] if and only if b2  -  α is a non-square of GF(q2) and the point [formula] of D is in [formula] if and only if b2  -  α is a non-zero square of GF(q2), a contradiction. Thus we can conclude that no conic Eb,k is contained in U.

Assume a = c = 0, so we can suppose b = 1. Equations ([\ref=eq_8]) reduce to

[formula]

If a' = 0 it is easily seen that there are no points in [formula]. Hence a'  ≠  0 and b' = 0 = c'. Equations ([\ref=eq_12]) reduce to Hence, ρ = k- 1, k = 1 + t and s = α(1 - k- 1) and we get the unique common point P(E) = (k, - α, - k,0,0,0). In order for E to be a conic in U, we should have that the line P(E)P(G) intersects the surface V in exactly one point, for every conic G of the pencil defined by C and D and contained in U. But this happens if and only if G coincides with either C or D. Since q > 3, the conics C, D and E don't cover all points of U.

Assume b = c = 0; so we can suppose a = 1. Equations ([\ref=eq_8]) reduce to

[formula]

If b' = 0 it is easily seen that there are no points in [formula]. Hence b'  ≠  0 and a' = 0 = c'. Equations ([\ref=eq_14]) reduce to

Analysis similar to the above case shows that the conics contained in U are precisely C, D and E:x2  -  αky2 = kz2, a contradiction. Finally, we conclude that there does not exist a unital U which union of irreducible conics with two conics defining a pencil of type (ii).

Case 3. C:2yz = x2 and D:2yz = x2 + kz2 for some [formula].

The intersection between C and D is the point P(0,1,0). Further, we have  det(A(C)) =  det(A(D)) =  - 1. By Theorem [\ref=th_3], every point of [formula] is in [formula] if and only if k is a non-square in GF(q2).

We first consider the irreducible conics in the pencil defined by C and D. If a conic E:2yz = x2 + hz2, h  ≠  1,k, is contained in U then h, h - k are non-square in GF(q2).

Hence such a set of conics determines a subset X of GF(q2) such that 1∈X, all elements of X are non-squares and for any h,k∈X, h - k is a non-square. To obtain a unital X must have size q.

[\cite=bl] Let X be a subset of GF(q2) of non-squares such that the difference of any two elements is always a non-square. If |X| = q, then X = tGF(q) for some non-square t∈GF(q2).

It follows that such a set X gives a Buekenhout-Metz unital of BEHS-type.

In order to investigate if there are further unitals union of conics we need, also in this case, to study [formula]:

[formula]

for some ρ∈GF(q)*. Also in this case we have (a,b,c)  ≠  (0,0,1)  ≠  (a',b',c') and [formula].

If either abc  ≠  0 or a = 0 or b = 0, it is easy to check that there are no points in [formula].

If c = 0 and ab  ≠  0, then Equations ([\ref=eq_30]) become If a' = 0, then ab = 0, a contradiction. If c' = 0, then k = 0, a contradiction. If (a,b,c) iss either (0,1,0) or (1,0,0), we leave to the reader to verify that there are no points in [formula].

This concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th_2].
