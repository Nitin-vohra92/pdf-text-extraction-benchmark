Confined Population III Enrichment and the Prospects for Prompt Second-Generation Star Formation

Introduction

Early numerical investigations of the formation of the first stars in metal-free cosmic halos arrived at the conclusion that the stars were isolated and rather massive, with masses [formula] [\citep=Bromm:99] [\citep=Bromm:02] [\citep=Abel:00] [\citep=Abel:02] [\citep=Gao:07] [\citep=OShea:07]. This was a theoretically attractive possibility, given that such massive stars would have unique radiative, nucleosynthetic, and other signatures. For example, a metal-free [formula] star could emit [formula] ionizing photons per second [\citep=BKL:01] [\citep=Schaerer:02], which would photoionize not only the star's parent cosmic minihalo, but a larger region of the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM). The star could explode as a ~  1053   pair-instability supernova (PISN), which could synthesize its own mass worth of metals. The baryonic content of the halo would be disrupted [\citep=Bromm:03b] and the metals would be dispersed far outside, thus enriching a relatively large region of the surrounding medium [\citep=Wise:08b] [\citep=Greif:10] [\citep=Maio:10] [\citep=Wise:12]. While this enrichment would have only a minor effect on the ultimate metal budget of the IGM [\citep=Scannapieco:02] [\citep=Yoshida:04], it would have the potential to raise the metallicity of larger collapsing halos above a "floor" thought to be necessary for fragmentation into low-mass stars [\citep=Bromm:03a] [\citep=Smith:08].

Much of the theoretical work on the formation of the first stars and galaxies [\citep=Wise:08a] [\citep=Wise:12] [\citep=Greif:10], and on strategies for detecting metal-free stellar populations in the observations of galaxies and supernovae [\citep=Schaerer:03] [\citep=Johnson:09] [\citep=Raiter:10] [\citep=Zackrisson:11], has postulated the massive character of metal-free stars. Recent numerical investigations, however, have shown that angular-momentum-induced fragmentation [\citep=Stacy:10] [\citep=Clark:11] and radiative termination of accretion [\citep=Hosokawa:11] [\citep=Stacy:12] during protostellar accretion could limit the masses of the first stars to as low as a few tens of solar masses, and could yield initial protostellar mass functions covering the entire range [formula] [\citep=Greif:11]. The final stellar mass range, at the end of protostellar accretion, could be [formula] with a characteristic mass of the order of [formula]. The cosmic imprint of such moderate mass first stars should be different than that of the very massive ones: the ionizing luminosities could be [formula] [\citep=Schaerer:02], supernova energies could be [formula], metal yields could be at most a few solar masses per supernova, and the characteristic nucleosynthetic return could potentially be more consistent with currently available observational data [\citep=Tumlinson:06] [\citep=Vangioni:11].

The evolution of minihalos containing only moderate mass stars should differ in critical ways from that of objects containing very massive Population III stars. With one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, [\citet=Whalen:08] showed that the region of a moderate mass star at the center of the minihalo may remain confined within the minihalo. They calculated that the blastwave of a 1051   supernova in [formula] minihalos, does, after ~  10  , reach the virial radius of the halo, and concluded that this results in the "disruption" of the baryonic component of the halo. They also considered high-mass [formula] minihalos in which a strong photodissociating background had prevented star formation [\citep=OShea:08], and found that there, the region may not form and the supernova blastwave may be confined at very small radii. They speculated that the subsequent prompt fallback of metal-enriched supernova ejecta into the center of the halo could lead to the formation of a globular-cluster-like stellar system, similar to the suggestion of [\citet=Wada:03] that a relatively small number of supernovae exploding in a more massive, [formula] cosmic halo could also lead to a fallback and prompt star cluster formation. This is a particularly interesting possibility, in view of the unexplained origin of metal-poor globular clusters [\citep=Brodie:06]: do they form in the centers of their own low-mass dark matter halos [\citep=Peebles:84] [\citep=Rosenblatt:88] [\citep=BrCl:02] [\citep=Boley:09] [\citep=Griffen:10], or do they form off-center in the merging and fragmentation of more massive protogalactic disks [\citep=Kravtsov:05]?

The aim of this paper is to pursue implications of the hypothesis that the first stars had moderate masses--masses that are insufficient to produce extraordinarily extended regions and ultra-energetic supernovae. It will be necessary to understand the entire evolution of supernova ejecta, from the point of injection in the supernova explosion until some fraction of the ejecta has become incorporated in new stars. Existing treatments of the initial phases, including metal injection in a supernova, the subsequent excursion into the environment, and a possible fallback in the host halo, have entailed one-dimensional simulations [\citep=Kitayama:05] [\citep=Whalen:08] or relatively low-resolution three-dimensional, grid-based or smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations [\citep=Nakasato:00] [\citep=Bromm:03b] [\citep=Greif:07] [\citep=Wise:08b]. These treatments point to either a prompt and widespread dispersal of the supernova ejecta into the primordial IGM--assuming that the supernovae were extraordinarily energetic--or, in the case of particularly high-mass halos hosting moderate mass stars, to a possible suppression of region breakout and the subsequent trapping and prompt fallback of the ejecta.

It is important to realize, however, that the fate of the supernova ejecta may be influenced by dynamical processes operating on relatively small spatial scales and strongly violating spherical symmetry. In addition to the likely intrinsic asphericity of the explosion itself, one such process is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the decelerating contact discontinuity after the ejecta have started to interact with the ambient medium. The ambient medium into which the supernova expands is bound to be inhomogeneous, especially if the luminosity of the progenitor stars and other hot stars that have formed with it is insufficient to completely photoionize the densest clumps remaining from the progenitor gas cloud. On the somewhat larger [formula] scales of the host minihalo, a pronounced departure from spherical symmetry will arise from the filamentary geometry of the cosmic web. Such asymmetry can interact with the expanding blastwave. Further, as an aging supernova remnant forms a thin, momentum-conserving snowplow shell, the decelerating shell is itself unstable to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and forms fingers. Finally, while the blastwave instabilities lead to partial mutual entrainment of the ejecta and the shocked primordial gas, any ejecta-enriched gas falling back toward the center of the halo, where it may engage in a new round of star formation, may not necessarily be chemically homogeneous (full chemical mixing requires at least a few turbulent eddy turnover times which may not be available in the blastwave).

In view of these complexities, here we report the first results from a program to study the detailed transport of the nucleosynthetic output of the first stars, from the point of injection in supernovae, until at least a fraction of the new metals have recondensed in a descendent cosmic halo where they may contribute to the formation of second-generation, metal-enriched stars. The character of the new star formation in the descendent halo must depend on the rate of gas inflow [formula] into the nucleus of the halo, where the gas can rapidly cool and fragment into stars. The cooling rate, and the compressibility of the turbulence that may be present, are sensitive to the metallicity of the inflowing gas Z inf and to the degree of metallicity homogeneity in the gas. We present the results of a cosmological simulation specifically designed to measure these parameters and thus shed light on the conditions for the formation of metal-enriched stars in the aftermath of a Population III supernova, assuming that it exploded with only 1051   of energy. The simulation shares some similarities with that of [\citet=Boley:09] and its setup has many common elements with that of [\citet=Wise:12]. The latter work followed the evolution of a cosmological region of the same size as ours but to much lower redshifts, with a focus on the statistics of star formation and metal enrichment across a large number of star-forming halos. Our focus, instead, is on the detailed, smaller-scale character of metal transport in the aftermath of a single supernova.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:simulations], we describe our numerical algorithm. In Section [\ref=sec:results], we present our results. In Section [\ref=sec:discussion], we discuss implications for the formation of metal-enriched star clusters in the early universe, and in Section [\ref=sec:conclusions], we present our main conclusions. We adopt the cosmological parameters consistent with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven-year data [\citep=Komatsu:11]. We explicitly indicate whether comoving or physical length units are utilized; all other quantities, such as density, are expressed in physical units.

Simulating a Supernova in a Minihalo

To investigate the fate of the first metals injected into the universe by a moderate mass Population III star, we carry out a cosmological simulation large enough not only to permit the formation of such a star, but also to allow the subsequent growth of the star's host halo, by accretion and merging, into a larger object that is the potential site of second-generation star formation. The metals must be inserted early on, before the freely expanding supernova remnant has started to interact with the primordial circumstellar medium; this is possible thanks to our ability to drastically increase the local mesh resolution at a specific time in the simulation--just prior to supernova explosion--and then gradually degrade the resolution as the remnant expands. To reproduce the remnant's dynamics correctly, during the progenitor star's life on the main sequence, we calculate the transfer of the star's ionizing radiation and the response of the circumstellar medium by the associated photoheating in the region. The simulation, which we proceed to describe, is designed to resolve the rudimentary time and length scales required to assess the impact of the supernova on the host halo and the nature of the metal-enriched flows in the aftermath of the supernova: how quickly do baryons return into the center of the halo (or one of its descendent halos), and how do the baryonic accretion rate and the metallicity of the accreted baryons evolve?

The description of the simulation is organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec:initial_conditions_gravity] describes the procedure by which the initial conditions were generated and the gravitational potential computation. Section [\ref=sec:chemistry] describes the chemical and thermodynamic calculations, with and without an ionizing source. Section [\ref=sec:amr] describes the strategies we employed to control the mesh refinement in the simulations. Section [\ref=sec:ionization] describes our algorithm for transfer of ionizing radiation from the first star. Finally, Section [\ref=sec:supernova] describes the insertion of the supernova remnant and the subsequent tracking of the metal transport in the simulation.

Cosmological Initial Conditions and Gravity

We initialize our simulation in a periodic cosmological box of volume 1  3 (comoving) at redshift z = 146. The initial conditions are generated with the multiscale cosmological initial conditions package GRAPHIC2 [\citep=Bertschinger:01] with two levels of nested refinement on top of the 1283 base grid. The highest refined region had an effective resolution of 5123, corresponding to a dark matter particle mass of [formula]. While we will focus on the dynamics of an initially [formula] minihalo at redshift z  ~  20, the region of high refinement was centered on the overdensity that first collapses to form a more massive [formula] halo at a lower redshift. The time integration was carried out with the multipurpose astrophysical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH [\citep=Fryxell:00], version 3.3, employing the direct multigrid Poisson gravity solver of [\citet=Ricker:08]. The AMR refinement criteria, which we describe in Section [\ref=sec:amr] below, are set to ensure that relevant baryonic processes are sufficiently well resolved in the simulation. In collapsing regions where baryons dominate the gravitational potential, the AMR resolution length quickly becomes smaller than the dark matter particle separation. There, we employ a mass- and momentum-conserving quadratic-kernel-based softening procedure developed in [\citet=SafranekShrader:12] which is applied to the dark matter density variable during mapping onto the computational mesh, to render the dark matter particle contribution to the gravitational potential smooth on the scale of the local AMR grid.

Chemistry and Cooling

Prior to the initialization of the region, we integrate the full nonequilibrium chemical network for hydrogen, helium, deuterium, and their chemical derivatives. The chemical and radiative cooling updates, which include, among other processes, the cooling or heating by the cosmic microwave background (CMB), are operator-split from the hydrodynamic update and are subcycled within each cell. The chemical reaction rates are the same as we have summarized in [\citet=SafranekShrader:10], except that the chemical and radiative cooling update is isochoric in the present simulation. The network is integrated with the Bulirsch-Stoer-type semi-implicit extrapolation method of [\citet=Bader:83]. We test the thermodynamic evolution of the gas in [\citet=SafranekShrader:12].

After turning on the ionizing source, which we describe in Section [\ref=sec:ionization] below, we continue to integrate the nonequilibrium chemical network in the neutral gas, but in the ionized gas, we adopt a scheme in which the gas temperature and chemical abundances relax exponentially toward a target photoionization equilibrium. The equilibrium gas temperature and chemical abundances are functions of the photoionization parameter [formula] only, where F is the radiative energy flux and nH is the number density of hydrogen nuclei and are precomputed with the same chemical network that we integrate in the neutral gas. The relaxation time scale is chosen to be the true, nonequilibrium thermal time scale [formula], defined by the instantaneous local radiative cooling and photoionization heating rates.

After inserting the supernova remnant, the gas can contain an arbitrary admixture of metals in addition to the primordial elements. The radiative point source is removed, thus discontinuing the photoionization equilibrium calculation. We revert to an integration of the nonequilibrium chemical network for the primordial species and calculate the ionization state of the metals and their contribution to the cooling by interpolation from precomputed tables. At temperatures above 8000  , the collisional ionization equilibrium state of each of the metal species, including C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe, is calculated separately using methods described in [\citet=Gnat:07] and [\citet=Gnat:11]. Below 8000   but above 200  , we ignore the metallic contribution to the free electron abundance and tabulate a single density-independent cooling function (such that the volumetric radiative loss rate scales with the square of the density), appropriate to a gas at relatively low densities [formula], using the code CLOUDY [\citep=Ferland:98]. The tabulated data extend to a minimum metallicity of [formula]; below this metallicity, we set the metal cooling rate in this range of temperatures to zero. Below 200  , we disable cooling by metal lines altogether; however, because low-temperature thermodynamics is not the focus of this work, this has no effect on the forthcoming results. The treatment of primordial species takes into account the electrons provided by the metals and vice versa, but we do not include collisional charge exchange reactions between the primordial species and the metal species. We assume that the metals have solar abundance ratios. This is an arbitrary, unnatural choice given that our metals are being produced by a core-collapse supernova, but this choice should have only a very minor effect on the thermodynamic evolution of the supernova remnant.

Adaptive Mesh Refinement Strategies

The simulation is set to adjust the FLASH refinement level [formula] based on the local baryon density ρb to ensure that denser regions are more highly refined. The grid separation (cell size) is related to the refinement level via [formula], where L is the size of the computational box. As gravitational collapse drives the local fluid density ρb to increasingly higher densities, the local refinement level is adjusted to satisfy [formula] at all times, where [formula] is the refinement level corresponding to the base grid of size [formula], and consistent with [\citet=SafranekShrader:12], we choose the scaling parameter to equal φ =  - 0.3. We insert the star particle when the hydrogen number density first exceeds 1000  - 3; this happens at redshift [formula] and refinement level [formula], corresponding to cell size Δx  ≈  0.74   (physical).

At the end of the star's life and just prior to inserting the young supernova remnant, we force the simulation to refine further to level [formula] at the location of the star particle, corresponding to cell size Δx  ≈  0.006   (physical). This allows us to insert the supernova remnant well within the free-expansion phase, before the ejecta have started to interact with the circumstellar environment. Then, we disable automatic derefinement, and allow the simulation to refine additional computational cells, up to the maximum level [formula] initially equal to 21, based on the standard second derivative test in FLASH, but in this case, the second derivative test is computed using the cell metallicity. This ensures that the entire region enriched with metals will be resolved at the refinement level [formula]. As the supernova remnant expands, we gradually and cautiously lower [formula], and thus coarsen the resolution of the metal-enriched region, to allow us to make ever longer time steps and integrate the simulation for 40   past the insertion of the supernova.

The First Star and Ionizing Radiation Transfer

When the hydrogen number density first exceeds 1000  - 3 near the center of the collapsing minihalo, we insert a collisionless star particle. The star is free to move in the combined gravitational potential of the dark matter and baryons but does not contribute to the potential, i.e., it is treated as massless. We assume that it is an isotropic source of hydrogen-ionizing radiation and treat the radiation as monochromatic with photon energy hν = 16   and photon emission rate [formula]. This ionizing photon rate is about three times as high as has been estimated for a [formula] metal-free star without mass loss, [formula] [\citep=Schaerer:02]. The ionizing photon energy is calibrated to the latter lower luminosity star. We deliberately overestimate the ionizing luminosity to allow for the presence of additional, lower-mass, longer-lived stars also producing additional ionizing photons in a compact cluster around the primary [formula] star. Also, the artificially high ionizing luminosity allows the region to break out more easily at the moderate spatial resolution at which we insert the star particle and perform ionizing radiation transfer.

To carry out ionizing radiation transfer, we center a spherical coordinate system on the current position of the star particle, and pixelize the angular coordinate using the HEALPix scheme of [\citet=Gorski:05] with Npix = 3072 pixels. Within each angular pixel, we split the radial coordinate in the range [formula] (comoving), corresponding to [formula] (physical), into Nrad = 103 logarithmic radial bins. For each volume element Ep,b defined by an angular HEALPix pixel p and a radial bin b, and for each mesh cell Ec defined by the cell index c, we compute the volume of the intersection of the two elements [formula]. In general, only a fraction of the cell lies within Ep,b. In this case, we recursively split the cell into sub-cells via an octree subdivision procedure and compute the contribution of the subcells lying within Ep,b to the intersection volume; the recursion is continued until a desired accuracy is achieved. Armed with the intersection volumes, we compute the average case-B hydrogen recombination rate [formula] evaluated under the assumption of full ionization (as in the standard Strömgren calculation) within each Ep,b via

[formula]

where [formula], Tc and nc, are, respectively the temperature and density of hydrogen nuclei within the cell, and αrec,B(T) is the hydrogen recombination coefficient. Within each bin, we compute the approximate integral of [formula] along the radial direction (now replacing the bin index b with the continuous radial coordinate r) and determine the pixel-specific Strömgren radius RS,p that solves the equation

[formula]

We assume that no ionizing radiation penetrates to radii r  ≥  RS,p. At smaller radii, we compute the local ionizing photon number flux (in the units of   - 2  - 1) using

[formula]

The local ionizing flux is then used to compute the local photoionization parameter for cell c lying within the pixel p with a center at a radius rc via ξp(r) = 4πhνfp(rc) / nc. Given a value of the photoionization parameter, the photoionization equilibrium temperature of the gas and the chemical abundances within the cell are evaluated via table lookup (see Section [\ref=sec:chemistry]). The computation is fully parallel and is repeated at every hydrodynamic time step. We do not compute the radiation pressure from Thomson scattering and photoionizations. This radiative transfer scheme is not explicitly photon conserving and is not designed to correctly reproduce the ionization front kinematics, but it is sufficiently accurate in the present context where the sole interest is in the hydrodynamic response of the gas to photoionization heating and its impact on supernova blastwave dynamics.

Supernova and Metal Transport

We insert the supernova in the free-expansion phase, when the remnant is about t - tSN = 35   old. The ejecta are cold and have a total mass [formula] and a total kinetic energy of ESN = 1051  . The metal yield is assumed to be ZSN = 0.1 and uniformly premixed in the ejecta, implying [formula] of metals. The velocity of the ejecta is linear in the distance from the center of the explosion and the density is uniform. The initial radius of the remnant is chosen such that its radius is 10% of the radius of the remnant at which the swept up mass equals the ejecta mass, or in this case, RSN = 0.075  . The simulation carries out advection of the absolute metallicity Z by treating it as a passive mass scalar quantity. This advection is subject to undesirable numerical diffusion, which is unavoidable in Eulerian solvers of this type [\citep=Plewa:99]. Therefore, in parallel with passive scalar advection, we also insert a number [formula] of passive Lagrangian tracer particles, originally uniformly distributed in the ejecta. The simulation advances particle positions by integrating the first-order ordinary differential equation [formula], where [formula] is the location of particle i, and [formula] is the baryon fluid velocity, quadratically interpolated from the computational grid, at the location of the particle. We do not take into account the possibility that the supernova may be a source of molecules and dust. Both are undoubtedly produced in the free-expansion phase, but their survival of the reverse shock hinges on small-scale clumpiness of the ejecta and on other complex, incompletely-understood physics [\citep=Cherchneff:09] [\citep=Cherchneff:10].

Results

Thermodynamical Properties

In Figure [\ref=fig:200], we show the redshift evolution of the radius R200 within which the average halo density equals 200 times the critical density, as well as the corresponding enclosed halo mass M200. The star particle is inserted at [formula] and the supernova at z  ≈  19.5. The halo radius doubles from R200  ≈  160   to 300   in the course of the simulation, and the halo mass quadruples from [formula] at star insertion to [formula] at the end of the simulation.

Figure [\ref=fig:denstemp] shows the density-temperature phase diagram for gas within 1   (physical) from the center of the halo, immediately prior to the formation of the star particle, after the supernova explosion, and finally at the end of the simulation when the halo mass has quadrupled. Comparison of the thermodynamic profile before stellar insertion and at the end of the simulation illustrates how the halo relatively quickly "recovers" from the radiative and kinetic impact of the first star and resumes central gravitational collapse. Prior to the photoionization by the star, the archetypical thermodynamic structure of a minihalo in which gas cools by rovibrational transitions of molecular hydrogen is evident. Photoionization and the supernova blastwave temporarily disrupt this structure. The photoionization raises the temperature of the photoionized gas to ≈  104  , while the explosion introduces hot gas that cools both adiabatically and radiatively. Because of the low energy and compactness of the remnant, the cooling by inverse Compton scattering of the CMB is relatively unimportant, different from the case of ultra-energetic Population III supernovae, where this cooling channel dominates the early evolution [\citep=Bromm:03b].

It is worth noting that an examination of the three-dimensional structure of the thermodynamic state of the gas shows that the dense, cold gas inside the filamentary structure feeding from the nearby cosmic web into the center of the minihalo is self-shielding and remains unaffected by photoionization. The blastwave also largely avoids these dense filaments, and they remain a repository of low-entropy gas. This is easily seen in Figure [\ref=fig:projection], which shows mass-weighted projected density, temperature, and metallicity 8.5   after the explosion. Outside of the filaments, after 40  , the effects of photoionization and the blastwave have largely been erased; the thermal phase structure within the halo is similar to that of a higher-mass unperturbed minihalo. The appearance of warmer ([formula]) gas at low densities reflects the higher virial mass of the halo at the end of the simulation and the residual entropy left by the fossil region. The presence of metals at local metallicities [formula] and an enhanced abundance of hydrogen-deuteride now facilitate more rapid cooling toward low temperatures. The enhanced cooling is now especially apparent at high densities [formula] that are found in the central region. The dense gas is insufficiently well resolved at the end of the simulation; the resolution limit hinders compression of the fluid to densities [formula]. Nevertheless, it is clear that the dense gas resides at temperatures a factor of a few lower than the gas at the same densities prior to the insertion of the ionizing source. We do not observe the anticipated gas cooling to the CMB temperature, either through metal line cooling or the cooling by hydrogen-deuteride [\citep=Johnson:06], because we enforced an artificial temperature floor at 200  .

Blastwave Evolution and Fallback

An insight in the rate of recovery of the halo can be obtained from Figure [\ref=fig:lagrangian_radii], which shows the Lagrangian radii that track the radial location of a grid of mass coordinates of the spherically averaged baryon and supernova ejecta mass as a function of time from the explosion. It is worth keeping in mind that the underlying flow is complex and contains simultaneous inflows and outflows that are averaged over; each of the radii reflects only the net displacement of the mass coordinate. The baryonic Lagrangian radii show expansion, driven by the supernova blastwave, starting at ≈  20   at the innermost radius shown, and appearing at progressively larger mass coordinates until outward-directed motion becomes evident near the virial radius at ≈  2   after the explosion. Each of the radii corresponding to mass coordinates inside the halo, however, shows a reversal from a net outflow to a net inflow. The reversal commences at ≈  400   at the innermost radius shown, and reaches progressively larger radii until ≈  20   when the flow at the virial radius turns around into an inflow. Outside of the virial radius, cosmic infall persists largely unabated throughout the remnant's history.

An examination of the evolution of the actual three-dimensional structure of the baryonic flow (see also the projection in Figure [\ref=fig:projection]) reveals that the prompt reversal can only in part be attributed to a fallback of the mass that the blastwave has swept up and to which it has transferred momentum. Instead, the filamentary inflow of dense, cold, molecular gas from the nearby cosmic web directly into the center of the minihalo contributes a large fraction of the mass inflow rate. The baryonic filaments are seen diagonally from top left to bottom right in Figure [\ref=fig:metal_fallback], which shows a slice of the density field. Because the filaments survive photoionization and the explosion largely intact, they can sustain a net inflow into the center of the halo even when a majority of the ejecta and the swept up mass are moving outward.

The Lagrangian radii for the supernova ejecta in Figure [\ref=fig:lagrangian_radii], right panel, show first signs of interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium around 1 - 10   after the explosion. What follows is a similar picture of expansion eventually reversing into fallback. Fractions of (3.125%,  6.25%,  12.5%,  25%,  50%) of the ejecta mass turn around and start falling back at around (0.2,  1.0,  4.0,  8.0,  3.0)   after the explosion. The corresponding turnaround radii are (3,  8,  30,  60,  200)  . The outer somewhat less than ~  50% of the ejecta passes the virial radius and continues to travel outward until the end of the simulation. The net outflow of ejecta at [formula] can be contrasted with the net inflow of baryons at the same radii, underscoring the three-dimensional nature of the flow and an inadequacy of one-dimensional integrations in treating the long-term dynamics of supernova remnants in cosmic minihalos. The spherical symmetry implicit in one-dimensional integrations forces the ejecta and the swept up circumstellar medium into a spherical thin shell at late times. It does not allow for the presence of the dense, low-entropy clouds that enter the halo by infall from the filaments of the cosmic web. The expanding shell may pass and leave behind such clouds. The spherical symmetry also does not allow radial segregation of the ejecta as a result of the instability of the decelerating thin shell.

Rayleigh-Taylor fingering is evident in Figure [\ref=fig:projection] at 8.5   after the explosion. The long term evolution of the fragmented shell is seen in Figure [\ref=fig:metal_fallback], left panel, which shows the ejecta tracer particles in projection, superimposed on a slice of the density field through the center of the halo. It is also clear in these figures that the blastwave has expanded biconically perpendicular to the sheet-like baryonic overdensity deriving from the cosmic web; this pristine gas, unpolluted by the ejecta, is still able to stream into the halo center. In the right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:metal_fallback], showing the central 360  , pristine baryonic streams arrive diagonally into the central few tens of parsecs, where they form a two-armed spiral and join a self-gravitating central core. At this point in the simulation, the spatial resolution is insufficient to resolve the internal structure of the core.

Strikingly, we observe filamentary accretion of ejecta-enriched gas perpendicular to the pristine sheet. This is the return of the ejecta from the supernova remnant back into the center of the halo. A closer examination of the time evolution of the ejecta kinematics shows that in the snowplow phase, the ejecta are compressed into a thin shell, as expected. The thickness of the shell is itself not well resolved, thus we are not in the position to explore its susceptibility to direct gravitational fragmentation [\citep=Salvaterra:04] [\citep=Machida:05] [\citep=Chiaki:12]. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability buckles and redistributes momentum in the shell. The highest momentum fragments continue semi-ballistically outward, consistent with the observation by [\citet=Whalen:08] that the blastwave of even a moderate 1051   explosion has enough momentum to escape a standard minihalo. The low-momentum fragments, however, do not have sufficient momentum to escape; they turn around, fall back, and eventually join the central unresolved core. The falling ejecta make thin multiply-folded streams and filaments, indicating what seems to be a certain lack of mixing with the halo gas. The pristine gas accreting through the filaments of the cosmic web, and the ejecta-enriched gas accreting from the supernova remnant, meet in the central core. If the core is turbulent--poor resolution at this stage of the simulation would not allow us to detect such turbulence--turbulent mixing of the ejecta and some swept up pristine gas with a much larger mass of pristine gas would ensue.

Metal Enrichment

In Figure [\ref=fig:mdot], we show the net rates of baryon and metal outflow from or inflow into the central 20   of the halo. Some baryonic inflow is already evident early on, after 50   from the explosion, and after ≈  1.5  , baryons transition to permanent inflow. After ≈  5  , the inflow rate settles at [formula]. The metal flow transitions from outflow to inflow at ≈  4   after the explosion, and fluctuates in the range [formula]. The average asymptotic absolute metallicity of the inflowing material is

[formula]

where we are referring to the total metal mass ignoring fractional abundances of individual metal species.

We proceed to examine the evolution of the metal-mass-weighted metallicity probability density function (PDF). The metallicity PDF is computed in three different ways. In the first, "fluid-fluid" method, the metallicity is obtained by summing the amplitudes of the passive scalars defining metal abundances on the computational grid. The metal mass at metallicity Z is then calculated by computing a volume integral of Zρ over the cells with metallicities in a narrow logarithmic bin containing Z. The shortcoming of this method is that it yields, as a consequence of a well-known shortcoming of passive scalar transport schemes, nonvanishing, small metallicities even in many cells that ejecta could not have reached on hydrodynamic grounds. With this in mind, the first method is more accurate where the metallicity is near its peak value, and is highly inaccurate elsewhere. Our remaining two methods for computing the metallicity PDF are designed to alleviate the impact of spurious diffusion.

In the second, "fluid-particle" method, the metallicity Z of a computational cell is calculated in the same way as in the first method, but the metal mass is calculated by summing the mass of the ejecta tracer particles in the cell, and multiplying by the ejecta absolute metallicity ZSN = 0.1. The tracer particle mass inside a cell is calculated with the cloud-in-cell method, with the weighting function taken to correspond to spreading the particle mass over a cubical kernel identical to the host cell, but centered on the particle. In the second method, only the cells with tracer particle presence contribute to the metallicity PDF. It should be kept in mind, however, that a metal particle displaced from the center of its host cell contributes mass to the neighboring cell that may be separated from the host cell by a shock transition or a contact discontinuity.

In the third, "particle-particle" method, the metallicity inside the cell is itself computed by summing up the metal mass inside the cell (again, as in the second method, computed by adding up tracer particle mass inside the cell and multiplying by ZSN), and dividing this by the sum of the metal mass and the fluid hydrogen and helium masses in the cell. Since the combined abundance of hydrogen and helium is near unity, the third method completely ignores the fluid metallicity as defined by the passive scalar advected on the computational grid. Ejecta particles as tracers of metallicity obviously do not suffer from the same spurious diffusion as the fluid metallicity, but they are affected by systematic issues of their own. In convergent flows such as near the insufficiently well resolved snowplow shell, metal particles can get trapped in discontinuous flow structures, which can produce a spurious increase of local metallicity as computed by the third method. Thus, while the fluid metallicity is bounded from above by its maximum value, ZSN = 0.1, at the point of injection, the particle-based metallicity can exceed this value and even approach unity.

In Figure [\ref=fig:histograms], we show the metal-mass-weighted metallicity PDF at four different times: first, in the Sedov-Taylor phase, and, then at approximately 1, 13, and 40   after the explosion. It is immediately clear that already at early times, the metallicity PDF exhibits a tail [formula] extending toward very low metallicities, where differences between the PDFs computed with the three methods became more severe. Spurious diffusion across compositional discontinuities in the fluid-based methods, and cloud-in-cell smearing in particle-based methods, both contribute to the tail. We also notice that the particle-particle method has developed a tail extending into the forbidden region, Z > ZSN, a clear signature of spurious particle trapping.

As the supernova remnant ages, metal mixing in the complex interior flow, which is numerical in the simulation but can be facilitated by turbulence in nature [\citep=Pan:11], broadens the metallicity peak from its initial location at Z  ≈  ZSN to an approximate range [formula], where Z max(t) is a time- and PDF-extraction-method-dependent maximum absolute metallicity. For fluid-based metallicity PDFs, we find that Z max  ≈  (0.07,  0.02,  0.002) at t - tSN  ≈  (1,  13,  40)  . We also notice a prominent narrow metallicity peak, built from cells belonging to the central, unresolved core that is accreting both from the pristine filaments of the cosmic web and from the ejecta-enriched supernova remnant fallback. The peak is migrating slowly toward lower metallicities, covering [formula] in the same three epochs. The metallicity of the unresolved core is consistent with the average metallicity of the accreting fluid given in equation ([\ref=eq:metallicity_accreting]).

Finally, we turn to the energetics of the metal-enriched material. In Figure [\ref=fig:energy], we show the evolution of the total kinetic and internal (thermal) energy of fluid elements having absolute metallicity Z  ≥  10- 6. At 1   after the explosion, the kinetic energy decreases below its initial value when the ejecta start interacting with the ambient medium and the well-resolved reverse shock facilitates kinetic-to-internal conversion. Adiabatic and radiative cooling both contribute to the rapid decrease of internal energy at 0.01 - 1.0   after the explosion. The renewed rise of both energies in the old remnant reflect the fallback of ejecta-enriched fluid in the halo center.

Discussion

Metal-Enriched Star Formation: Continuous, Bursty, or Self-Limiting?

The prompt resumption of baryonic infall into the center of the cosmic minihalo suggests that star formation could resume on similarly short, ~  1 - 5   time scales. In the simulation presented here, the metals that the supernova has synthesized begin returning to the halo center [formula] after the explosion. The mean metallicity of the inflow, averaged over the primordial streams and the metal-enriched collapsing supernova remnant streams converging in the center of the halo, is [formula] assuming a net supernova metal yield of [formula]. If the metal-rich gas successfully mixes with the primordial gas, then, according to a prevailing belief, the metallicity of the combined streams is well sufficient to ensure that new star formation in this gas should be producing normal, low-metallicity Population II stars. The Population III to II transition cannot be ascertained in the present simulation because the simulation does not adequately resolve the cold gas at densities [formula]. This gas belongs to the central core and is colder than primordial gas at the same densities preceding the insertion of the first star. It is at unresolved densities that the metallicity of the gas strongly affects the thermodynamic evolution and thus governs the outcome of fragmentation [\citep=Omukai:05] [\citep=Santoro:06] [\citep=Schneider:06] [\citep=Smith:09] [\citep=SafranekShrader:10].

The gaseous core in the center of the minihalo that is fed by metal-enriched streams can be compared to the star-forming core of a giant molecular cloud (GMC). We attempt such comparison with an eye on the overall hydrodynamics of the gas flow, putting aside any differences in chemical composition, dust content, CMB temperature, etc., in the two systems. Dense GMC cores grow by accreting from larger-scale, lower-density cloud environments which are supersonically turbulent. Smaller cores and their embedded forming star clusters merge with each other to form larger associations. Star formation in the cores is thought to be self-regulated, with the "feedback" from ongoing star formation controlling the amount of star-forming gas available and eventually leading to GMC dissolution [\citep=Murray:10] [\citep=Murray:11] [\citep=Goldbaum:11] [\citep=Lopez:11]. The feedback entails, e.g., the pressure of the regions and the pressure of direct stellar radiation. While the baryonic mass of a cosmic minihalo is perhaps smaller than that of a GMC, the centrally concentrated underlying dark matter halo renders the gravitational potential depth in a minihalo's central gaseous core similar to that in a GMC's star-forming core. The underlying dark matter gravitational potential may make a cosmic minihalo less susceptible to star-formation-induced dissolution than a GMC, assuming that the two systems are forming stars at the same rate.

GMCs are thought to sustain star formation over tens of millions of years, in spite of the regions, supernovae, and other feedback activity that commences quickly following the formation of the first massive stars. The feedback's impact preceding the eventual dissolution of the cloud complex may be limited to reducing the average star formation rate. We do not know whether star formation in metal-enriched minihalos and their descendent [formula] halos can be sustained as in GMCs in spite of the feedback, or is the feedback from second-generation stars so effective as to evacuate baryons from the halo and prevent further star formation on cosmological time scales [\citep=Mori:02]. It seems that these two scenarios can be evaluated only with attention to the detailed, small-scale mechanics of star formation and its feedback. A corollary of the first scenario would be the presence of multiple, chemically distinct stellar populations in the stellar system that forms this way.

The statistics of low-luminosity stellar systems in the Local Group in conjunction with theoretical modeling of structure formation in a ΛCDM universe suggests that star formation must have, to some extent, been suppressed in low-mass cosmic halos [\citep=Susa:04a] [\citep=Ricotti:05] [\citep=Gnedin:06] [\citep=Moore:06] [\citep=Madau:08] [\citep=Bovill:09] [\citep=Bovill:11] [\citep=Koposov:09] [\citep=Munoz:09] [\citep=Salvadori:09] [\citep=Busha:10] [\citep=Gao:10] [\citep=Griffen:10] [\citep=Maccio:10] [\citep=Okamoto:10] [\citep=Font:11] [\citep=Lunnan:11] [\citep=Rashkov:11]. This suppression, however, could have arisen both internally, as in GMCs, and externally, where the suppression is driven by the heating of the IGM by the background ionizing radiation coming from other, more massive, less common halos [\citep=Thoul:96] [\citep=Kepner:97] [\citep=Barkana:99] [\citep=Shapiro:04] [\citep=Susa:04b] [\citep=Mesinger:06] [\citep=Mesinger:08] [\citep=Okamoto:08]. The heating could have shut off the inflow of fresh gas into the halo, eventually stunting star formation. The prevalence of either suppression mechanism as a function of halo properties cannot be understood without first understanding the detailed mechanics of star formation and feedback following the initial fallback of Population III supernova ejecta.

The Implications of Uncertainties Related to the Nature of First Stars

A source of uncertainty regarding the formation and nature of the first metal-enriched star clusters is the incomplete understanding of the precise character of metal-free Population III stars, and of the energetics and nucleosynthetic output of the associated supernovae. Theoretical investigations of Population III star formation have not yet converged and the precise functional form of the resulting initial mass function is not yet known. The evolution of metal-free stars is very sensitive to their poorly-understood internal rotational structure starting with the protostellar phase [\citep=Stacy:11]. Similarly, the explosion mechanism in metal-poor stars is not known. Each of the suggested mechanisms, including the standard delayed-neutrino mechanism hypothesized to drive Type II explosions, and the pair-instability and pulsational pair-instability mechanisms expected in relatively massive metal-free stars [\citep=Chatzopoulos:12] [\citep=Yoon:12], as well as the more exotic "hypernova"-type mechanisms involving a (possibly magnetized) outflow from a central compact object, implies its own characteristic explosion energy and nucleosynthetic imprint.

Many investigations of the formation of first stars and galaxies and their role in reionization have explored implications of the hypothesis that Population III stars had high masses, explosion energies, and metal yields. We find that the opposite limit of moderate masses, explosion energies, and metal yields might imply sharply divergent outcomes, not only for the parent cosmic minihalos, but also for the overall pace of transformation of the early universe. A related issue is the nature of the first galaxies [\citep=BrYo:11]. Their assembly process is influenced by the feedback from the Population III stars that formed in the minihalo progenitor systems, and this feedback in turn sensitively depends on the mass scale of the first stars. In the case of extremely massive stars, negative feedback is very disruptive, completely sterilizing the minihalos after only one episode of star formation. Only after ~  108   did the hot gas sufficiently cool to enable the recollapse into a much more massive dark matter halo, where a second-generation starburst would be triggered [\citep=Wise:08b] [\citep=Greif:10]. This separation into two distinct stages of star formation would be smoothed out in the case studied here. Indeed, the first galaxies may then already have commenced their assembly in massive minihalos, as opposed to the atomic cooling halos [\citep=OhH:02] implicated in the previous scenario.

Conclusions

We have carried out a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation designed to investigate the evolution of a cosmic minihalo in the aftermath of the formation of the first, Population III star, assuming that the star has a moderate mass and explodes as a moderate-energy Type II-like supernova, consistent with the recent downward revision of Population III star mass estimates [\citep=Stacy:10] [\citep=Stacy:12] [\citep=Clark:11] [\citep=Greif:11] [\citep=Hosokawa:11]. We analyzed the dynamics of supernova ejecta and gas flow inside the minihalo. These can be compared to similar studies involving massive Population III stars exploding as ultra-energetic PISNe. Our main conclusions are as follows.

The moderate-mass star and the moderate-energy supernova it produces inflict significantly smaller damage to the host minihalo than that inflicted by a massive star exploding as an ultra-energetic supernova. The star only partially photoionizes the host halo. The densest gas flowing from the filaments of the cosmic web into the star's parent cloud remains neutral and survives the supernova blastwave. This dense gas resumes accretion into the center of the minihalo only [formula] after the explosion. After ~  20  , all spherically-averaged baryonic mass coordinates are moving inward and the accretion rate at the center of the halo is [formula].

Following instability of the blastwave during the snowplow phase, a fraction of the supernova ejecta starts falling back to the center of the halo. The ejecta fallback accretion rate reaches a steady state after ~  5  . The accreting ejecta are incompletely mixed with the primordial gas and are confined in thin sheets and filaments. Less than a half of the ejecta escape the virial radius; the escaping ejecta can be traced back to the outermost Rayleigh-Taylor fingers.

The average metallicity of the accreting matter is in the range [formula]. This result depends on the assumed supernova energy and metal yield, but in this study, we did not pursue parameter space exploration. The metallicity of the accreted gas is sufficient to ensure that new stars forming in the central core, unresolved in the simulation, will have even lower characteristic masses.

These results bring into focus metal-enriched star formation in cosmic minihalos and their immediate descendent halos. The character of post-supernova metal transport and gravitational fragmentation of the metal-enriched gas, and of the impact of subsequent star formation and supernovae, are both worth addressing in follow-up investigations. The early universe likely exhibited a range of different explosion settings, from modest to ultra-energetic. It will be intriguing to see how these high-redshift systems are matched with possible local fossils, such as the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies [\citep=Bovill:09] [\citep=Salvadori:09] [\citep=Tumlinson:10] and metal-poor globular clusters [\citep=Brodie:06]. From what we have already learned, Population III supernova feedback appears to play a key role in shaping early cosmic history and the nature of relic stellar systems.
