How atomic nuclei cluster

The occurrence of molecular states in atomic nuclei and the formation of clusters of nucleons were already predicted in the 30's by von Weizsäcker and Wheeler [\cite=1] [\cite=2]. Even though the description of nuclear dynamics became predominantly based on the concept of independent nucleons in a mean-field potential, a renewed interest in clustering phenomena in the 60's led to the development of dedicated theoretical methods [\cite=3]. Numerous experimental studies have revealed a wealth of data on clustering phenomena in light nuclei [\cite=4], and modern theoretical approaches use microscopic models that fully take into account single-nucleon degrees of freedom [\cite=5] [\cite=6] [\cite=7]. Clustering gives rise to nuclear molecules. For instance, in 12C the second 0+ state the Hoyle state that plays a critical role in stellar nucleosynthesis, is predicted to display a three-α structure [\cite=8] [\cite=9]. The binding energy of the α-particle, formed from two protons and two neutrons, is much larger than in other light nuclei. Cluster radioactivity [\cite=10], discovered in the 80's, is another manifestation of clustering in atomic nuclei. Experimental signatures of clustering are usually indirect. Quasi-molecular resonances are probed by scattering one cluster on another, such as in the 12C+12C system [\cite=4] [\cite=11], and cluster structures are also discernible in the breakup of nuclei. Evidence has been reported for the formation of clusters in ground and excited states of a number of α-conjugate nuclei [\cite=4], that is nuclei with an equal even number of protons and neutrons, from 8Be to 56Ni.

The mechanism of cluster formation in nuclei has not yet been fully understood. Deformation plays an important role because it removes the degeneracy of single-nucleon levels associated with spherical symmetry. At specific deformations the shell structure can restore degeneracies corresponding, for instance, to a 2:1 ratio of the large axis over the small axis of a quadrupole deformed system4. Consequently, the restored degeneracy of deformed shell closures facilitates the formation of clusters. However, this is a rather qualitative explanation because clustering phenomena cannot generally be explained by accidental degeneracies. Clustering is an essential feature of many-nucleon dynamics that coexists with the nuclear mean-field. Therefore, although in most cluster models the existence of such structures is assumed a priori and the corresponding effective interactions are adjusted to the binding energies and scattering phase shifts of these configurations, a fully microscopic understanding of cluster formation necessitates a more general description that encompasses both cluster and quantum liquid-drop aspects in light as well as in heavier nuclei. The aim of this work is to address the origin of clustering, i.e. to find out the conditions for cluster formation in ground states of finite nuclei, starting from a fully microscopic description based on the framework of energy density functionals.

At present the only comprehensive approach to nuclear structure is based on the framework of energy density functionals (EDFs). Nuclear EDFs enable a complete and accurate description of ground-state properties and collective excitations over the whole nuclide chart [\cite=12] [\cite=13] [\cite=14]. In practical implementations nuclear EDFs are analogous to Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory, the most widely used method for electronic structure calculations in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. In the nuclear case the many-body dynamics is represented by independent nucleons moving in a local self-consistent mean-field potential that corresponds to the actual density and current distribution of a given nucleus. Both non-relativistic and relativistic realizations of EDFs are employed in studies of nuclear matter and finite nuclei. A nuclear EDF is universal in the sense that, for a given inter-nucleon interaction, it has the same functional form for all systems. Using a small set of global parameters adjusted to empirical properties of homogeneous nuclear matter and data on finite nuclei, a universal functional provides a description of the structure of nuclei across the chart of nuclides and, therefore, describes the coexistence of cluster and quantum-liquid aspects of light nuclei.

A number of recent studies based on nuclear EDFs or the mean-field approach have analysed cluster structures in α-conjugate nuclei [\cite=15] [\cite=16] [\cite=17] [\cite=18] [\cite=19] [\cite=20] [\cite=21]. In Fig. 1 we display the self-consistent ground-state densities of 20Ne, calculated with two widely used functionals that are representative for the two classes of nuclear EDFs: the non-relativistic Skyrme SLy4 [\cite=22], and the relativistic functional DD-ME2 [\cite=23]. The equilibrium shape of 20Ne is a prolate, axially symmetric quadrupole ellipsoid. Although they have not been specifically adjusted to this mass region, both functionals reproduce the empirical ground-state properties of this nucleus: the experimental binding energy 160.6 MeV, the radius of the proton distribution 2.90 fm [\cite=24], and the radius of the matter distribution 2.85 fm [\cite=25], with a typical accuracy of  1%. It is remarkable that, although these functionals predict similar values for the binding energy, charge and matter radii, as well as the quadrupole deformation of equilibrium shape of 20Ne, yet the corresponding single-nucleon densities are qualitatively very different. The density calculated with SLy4 displays a smooth behaviour characteristic for a Fermi liquid, with an extended surface region in which the density very gradually decreases from the central value of   0.16 fm- 3. The relativistic functional DD-ME2, on the other hand, predicts an equilibrium density that is much more localized. The formation of cluster structures is clearly visible, with density spikes as large as   0.2 fm- 3, and a much narrower surface region.

Understanding the difference in the equilibrium densities of 20Ne calculated with SLy4 and DD-ME2 is the key to the mechanism of cluster formation in this mass region of α-conjugate deformed nuclei. The axially symmetric deformation of the nuclear mean-field removes the degeneracy of spherical single-nucleon levels, and nucleons pairwise (spin up and down) occupy orbitals characterized by time-reversal degeneracy. For large deformations these levels can be labelled by a set of asymptotic Nilsson quantum numbers[\cite=26] and, because of the relatively weak Coulomb interaction in light nuclei, the localization of proton and neutron orbitals is similar in Z = N nuclei. In the specific case of 20Ne, ten protons and ten neutrons occupy five deformed Nilsson levels, with the energy spacing between these levels being proportional to the deformation of the single-nucleon potential. Figure 2 shows the partial single-nucleon densities that correspond to highest occupied Nilsson orbital. Even without introducing a quantitative measure of localization, it is obvious that DD-ME2 predicts a much more localized density distribution. Similar results, i.e. more localized density distributions calculated with DD-ME2, are also obtained for the other four occupied orbitals.

Localization of densities that correspond to single-particle orbitals is a necessary precondition for the formation of clusters, and this effect can be traced back to the corresponding single-nucleon spectra. The comparison of spectra calculated with the two functionals shows that the one obtained with DD-ME2 is more spread out, and the more pronounced energy spacings between single-particle levels are also reflected in the more localized wave functions and partial densities. Starting from degenerate spherical single-particle levels, the splitting of the corresponding Nilsson deformed states is proportional to the deformation and to the depth of the potential. Since the two functionals predict almost identical equilibrium deformations and radii for 20Ne, the different energy spacings in the single-nucleon spectra must reflect the difference in the corresponding potentials. In fact, the self-consistent mean-field potential of DD-ME2 is considerably deeper than that of SLy4. In the centre of the nucleus the depth of the DD-ME2 single-neutron potential is -78.6 MeV, whereas the depth of the SLy4 potential is -69.5 MeV. The corresponding values of the single-proton potentials are: -72.8 MeV for DD-ME2, and -64.6 MeV for SLy4. The effect of the potential depth on the localization of wave functions is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3 where, as an approximation to nuclear potentials, we plot three harmonic oscillator potentials with different values of the depth: 30, 45 and 60 MeV, but with the same radius R = 3 fm. The radial wave functions of the corresponding p-states are shown in the lower panel. The oscillator length b determines the position of the maximum and the dispersion of the wave function[\cite=27]. The deeper the potential, the smaller the oscillator length, and the wave functions become more localised. At the origin of clustering is, therefore, the depth of the self-consistent single-nucleon mean-field potential associated with a given energy density functional. By performing a series of self-consistent mean-field calculations using a variety of non-relativistic and relativistic functionals, not only for 20Ne, but also for 24Mg, 28Si and 32S, we have verified that pronounced cluster structures in deformed equilibrium shapes indeed occur only for deep single-nucleon potentials.

The difference of the potential depths calculated with DD-ME2 and SLy4 is characteristic for relativistic vs non-relativistic self-consistent potentials. The depth of a relativistic potential is determined by the difference of two large fields: an attractive (negative) Lorentz scalar potential of magnitude  400 MeV, and a repulsive Lorentz vector potential  320 MeV (plus the repulsive Coulomb potential for protons) [\cite=12] [\cite=13] [\cite=14]. The choice of these potentials is further constrained by the fact that their sum (~   700 MeV) determines the effective single-nucleon spin-orbit potential. In a non-relativistic approach the spin-orbit potential is included in a purely phenomenological way, with the strength of the interaction adjusted to empirical energy spacings between spin-orbit partner states. Since the relativistic scalar and vector fields determine both the effective spin-orbit potential and the self-consistent single-nucleon mean-field, for all relativistic functionals the latter is found to be deeper than the non-relativistic mean-field potentials, for which no such constraint arise.

More generally, fermionic systems can exhibit a crystalline phase or, on the other extreme, a quantum liquid phase. B. Mottelson considered the quantality [\cite=28] parameter to show that nuclear matter displays a quantum liquid structure. This concept can be generalised by considering nuclear clusters as transitional states between crystalline and quantum liquid phases (Fig. 4). The dimensionless ratio α = b/r0 , where b is the dispersion of the nucleon wave-function, and r0 the typical inter-nucleon distance (~   1.2 fm), is the natural parameter to quantify nuclear clustering, in analogy with similar considerations in condensed matter[\cite=29].

For a harmonic oscillator

[formula]

where V0 is the depth of the potential, and R the radius of the system.

When α >  1 nucleons are delocalised and the nucleus has a quantum liquid structure. The transition to a cluster state occurs when α ~   1, nucleons become more localised and form a molecular structure (Fig. 4). In the present analysis we find that α <   1 for the relativistic functional, whereas α >  1 for the non-relativistic functional. Moreover, from its definition in the case of a harmonic oscillator potential (see Eq. (1)), α obviously increases with the number of nucleons (nuclear radius). Cluster states, therefore, are less likely to appear in heavier nuclei.
