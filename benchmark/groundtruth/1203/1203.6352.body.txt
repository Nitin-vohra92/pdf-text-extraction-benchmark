No Evidence for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in Globular Clusters: Strong Constraints from the JVLA

Introduction

Supermassive black holes reside in the centers of most massive galaxies, and these black holes are expected to have grown from an initial population of "seed" black holes through gas accretion and mergers (Volonteri & Perna 2005). This seed population may originate in Population III stars, direct collapse out of dense gas disks, or the cores of young massive star clusters via runaway stellar mergers (e.g., Portegies Zwart et al. 2004). A subset of these star clusters are expected to survive to the present day and form the observed population of old globular clusters (GCs) around galaxies like our Milky Way. This possibility motivates the search for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; 102-[formula]) in Galactic GCs.

The most popular method for IMBH searches in GCs has been dynamical analyses of stars near the cluster center: objects with central IMBHs will have identifiable signatures in their line-of-sight velocity distributions (including high velocity dispersions) near the radius of influence: typically ~  0.05 pc = 1-2 arcsec (Gebhardt et al. 2000; Gerssen et al. 2002, 2003). Unfortunately, in many cases the predicted dynamical signature can be mimicked by other effects (such as a population of mass-segregated neutron stars), and the data are fundamentally limited by shot noise due to the small number of stars within the sphere of influence (e.g., Baumgardt et al. 2003; van der Marel & Anderson 2010).

Analogous to active galactic nuclei, IMBHs can also be detected by their accretion signatures. At low accretion rates, X-rays are produced by the accretion flow and radio continuum emission through synchrotron radiation from the emitted jets. In a GC, the winds of evolved stars provide a continual flux of gas into the intracluster medium; only a small fraction of this material would need to be accreted by a putative IMBH to provide significant accretion luminosity (e.g., Pooley & Rappaport 2006).

Merloni et al. (2003) and Falcke et al. (2004) showed that the X-ray and radio luminosity of both stellar-mass and supermassive accreting BHs in the low/hard state fall on a fundamental plane with BH mass, suggesting that the underlying accretion physics has commonalities at a wide range of masses and accretion rates. This plane offers the possibility to set quantitative constraints on the mass of an accreting BH via X-ray and radio observations. The sense of the relation is that for more massive BHs and those with lower accretion rates, the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity increases.

The commissioning of the Karl G. Jansky VLA (JVLA), with an eventual increase of a factor of 10-80 in the available bandwidth, has provided an extraordinary improvement in sensitivity for observations of faint radio continuum sources (Perley et al. 2011). As a pilot project, we have obtained very deep images of the GCs M19 (NGC 6273) and M22 (NGC 6656) to search for central IMBHs. These clusters were chosen on the basis of their declination, moderately high masses and close distances, and large ratios of core to half-light radii (proposed as one marker for the presence of an IMBH; Trenti et al. 2007). To these GCs we add M15 (NGC 7078), a cluster long discussed as a potential IMBH host (e.g., Gerssen et al. 2002), for which JVLA data were recently obtained for a transient monitoring campaign.

Data

We observed M19 and M22 with the JVLA over the period 2011 May 19 to 29 as part of the program 10C-109 (P.I. Chomiuk). Ten hours were spent observing each source in BnA configuration, split among four 2.5 hour blocks. 7.5 hr were spent on source. M15 was observed as part of a monitoring campaign of the X-ray binary M15 X-2 between 2011 May 22 and 2011 August 22, under program 11A-269 (P.I. Miller-Jones). Data were obtained in the BnA and A configurations, spread across five epochs for a total of 10 hours (5.25 hr on target).

We observed with 2048 MHz of bandwidth and four polarization products, with two separate 1 GHz basebands centered at 5.0 and 6.75 GHz (5.0 and 7.45 GHz in the case of M15). The resolution our M22 and M19 images is [formula], and [formula] for M15.

Data were reduced using standard routines in CASA and AIPS. Each observing block was edited for bad data and interference and then calibrated. The two calibrated basebands were split off from one another, and all data for a given object and baseband were concatenated in the uv plane and imaged with a Briggs robust weighting of 1. There is a bright extended source near M15's core (the planetary nebula K648), so we self-calibrated these data to minimize sidelobes. To obtain the deepest combined image possible for each GC, we smoothed the image from the higher-frequency baseband to the resolution of the 5.0 GHz image and averaged these two images together, providing an rms sensitivity of 1.5 μJy beam- 1 for M19 and M22, and 2.1 μJy beam- 1 for M15.

Results

Cluster Centers

Our principal result is that there is no significant radio continuum source at any position consistent with the photometric center of any of our GCs. For M19 and M22 the closest 5σ sources to the cluster centers are at respective angular separations of 28arcsec and 16arcsec. M15 has three sources close to the center, and all are known: the X-ray binaries AC 211 and M15 X-2 (Johnston et al. 1991; Miller-Jones et al. 2011) and the pulsar PSR B2127+11A (Wolszczan et al. 1989). The closest unidentified source to the photometric center of M15 is at ~   ~ 11 arcsec .

For M15 and M22 the centers are from ellipse fitting of resolved star counts in HST/ACS data, with uncertainties of 0.2arcsec and 0.8arcsec (Goldsbury et al. 2010). The M19 center (uncertainty ~  1.1 arcsec ) is from Picard & Johnston (1995), from ground-based imaging.

The uncertainty in the photometric center is only one component of the overall uncertainty in the possible location of a central IMBH. Encounters with passing stars will perturb the IMBH from the center, and in the mass regime under consideration the perturbations can be significant. For an assumed Plummer model, Chatterjee et al. (2002; see also van der Marel & Anderson 2010) predict that the variance of mean-squared one-dimensional deviations will be: < x2 ~  >  = (2 / 9)(m* / MBH)r2c where m* =  < m2 >  /  < m >  over the stars in the core, MBH is the IMBH mass, and rc is the Plummer core radius. Because mass segregation can deplete the core of low-mass stars, we adopt a conservative value of [formula]. For MBH, the most conservative assumption is the defined lower mass limit for an IMBH: [formula]. For this set of conservative assumptions, the formula above suggests that the typical displacement from the center is ~  5% of the core radius. For our actual 3σ IMBH mass limits (see § 3.3), the displacements are [formula]% of the core radius, and smaller than the uncertainties in the photometric centers.

M22 has by far the largest core radius of the three GCs; McLaughlin & van der Marel (2005) find a King radius r0 = 85arcsec. Using the equation above, we estimate the typical one-dimensional deviation of a [formula] IMBH in the core of M22 to be ~  4arcsec. The cores of M15 and M19 are much smaller than in M22, with predicted deviations of 0.2arcsec and 1.3arcsec. In all cases the closest unidentified 5σ sources to the cluster centers are all at much larger angular separations than these values. Images of the cores of all of the clusters are shown in Figure 1. The previously unknown non-central sources will be discussed in future papers.

We conclude that there are no candidate IMBH detections in any of the clusters, even when considering offsets from the photometric center due to Brownian motion.

Upper Limits on Central Sources

Because of the combined effects of Brownian motion and the uncertainties in the cluster photometric centers, we report upper limits for central point sources on the basis of the noise properties of the central region of the image as a whole, rather than a flux density limit at the location of the beam corresponding to the center.

The 3σ rms flux density in the cores of M19 and M22 is 4.5 μJy; in M15 it is 6.3 μJy. These limits are given in Table 1. We use these values to calculate 3σ upper limits on the masses of central IMBHs. M19 and M22 have no previously published limits on a central point source; Bash et al. (2008) give a 3σ limit of 25.5 μJy at 8.6 GHz for M15.

IMBH Mass Limits

Here we translate the flux density upper limits from §3.2 into corresponding limits on the masses of accreting IMBHs. We follow the basic method outlined in Maccarone & Servillat (2008, see also Maccarone et al. 2005): we predict the (mass-dependent) X-ray luminosity of the IMBH, then use the radio-X-ray fundamental plane for accreting black holes in the low/hard state (Merloni et al. 2003; Falcke et al. 2004) to convert the radio constraint to a mass constraint. We briefly summarize the principal assumptions here; more details may be found in the cited references. Uncertainties in these assumptions are discussed in §3.4.

We assume that the X-ray luminosity is given by the standard equation: [formula] with radiative efficiency ε and mass accretion rate [formula]. Rather than the standard ε = 0.1, we assume that at low accretion rates the efficiency scales linearly with the accretion rate: [formula]. Here we define a low accretion rate as [formula], which is the typical state transition luminosity for X-ray binaries (Maccarone 2003). Requiring continuity with ε = 0.1 at the transition gives [formula] at low accretion rates. We also assume that [formula] is given by 3% of Bondi rate for gas at T = 104 K (Pellegrini 2005), noting that it is the product [formula] which is observable. The density of this gas is assumed to be ρ = 0.2    - 3 (see § 3.4). Any accreting IMBHs in GCs will be in the low/hard state: sources accreting at higher rates would be easily detectable as luminous X-ray sources in existing surveys.

We use an updated form of the radio-X-ray BH fundamental plane from Plotkin et al. (2012). Their "contracted" sample is used, which includes Galactic stellar-mass BHs, Sgr A*, and some nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (but excludes BL Lacs and FR I radio galaxies). This plane is given by:

[formula]

where LX is the X-ray luminosity and LR is the radio luminosity, both in units of erg s- 1. This version of the fundamental plane has a scatter of σ = 0.4, corresponding to a factor of 2.5 in X-ray luminosity. The plane is defined at 5 GHz, and we assume flat radio spectra.

Given these assumptions, our 3σ flux density limits translate directly to 3σ IMBH mass limits. For M15, M19, and M22, these values are: 980, 730, and 360 [formula]. Figure 2 illustrates these limits graphically.

We emphasize that these values--unlike some in the literature--utilize conservative assumptions about the accretion rate and efficiency. For example, mass limits based on X-ray non-detections alone have typically assumed accretion at the full Bondi rate and with a fixed radiative efficiency (e.g., Grindlay et al. 2001). This difference in approach explains why similar published constraints are often derived from X-ray and radio measurements, even though radio observations are more sensitive to the presence of IMBHs.

In M22, the 360 [formula] limit corresponds to ε  ~  3  ×  10- 6, comparable to that derived from some models of the accretion onto Sgr A* (Narayan et al. 1998; Quataert & Gruzinov 2000), and the predicted X-ray luminosity is 9  ×  1029 erg s- 1. The associated accretion rate limit is [formula], 0.1% of the typical ongoing mass loss from a single cluster red giant (Dupree et al. 2009).

Mass Limit Uncertainties

There are uncertainties in most of our assumptions about the properties of accretion onto possible IMBHs. Here we describe the characterization of these uncertainties and Monte Carlo simulations to assess their cumulative effects.

We assume that the IMBH accretes at a fraction of the Bondi rate. The measurements of Pellegrini (2005) suggest that active galactic nuclei typically accrete at a few percent of the Bondi rate, but with a large scatter. We therefore assume a lognormal distribution for the fraction of Bondi (fb) centered at fb  =  0.03, with σ  =  0.7 (in log fb), and truncated above at fb  =  1. Since observations constrain the product [formula] rather than either quantity alone, this distribution of fb should be interpreted as including some uncertainty in ε as well.

The Bondi rate itself depends on the density of gas surrounding the IMBH. There are two GCs for which measurements of intracluster gas have been published: 47 Tuc and M15 (Freire et al. 2001). Both measurements are from variations in the dispersion measures of pulsars in GC cores, and are sensitive to the number density of free electrons. These estimates are ne  =  0.07 and 0.2    - 3, respectively, although foreground contamination cannot be ruled out in the case of M15. These measurements of the free electron density indicate the presence of ionized gas. Theoretically, of order 1    - 3 of gas should be present in the core of a GC based on simple free-streaming mass loss from first-ascent red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars (Pfahl & Rappaport 2001). We note that these estimates are far below the upper limits from typical integrated measurements of or free-free emission in GCs (e.g., van Loon et al. 2006; Knapp et al. 1996). We summarize these joint constraints with a normal distribution for ρ with μ  =  0.2 and σ  =  0.1, truncated at zero.

The uncertainty in the fundamental plane was included as published in Plotkin et al. (2012): σ  =  0.4 in the prediction of log LX. We also used the uncertainty in the cluster distances as listed in Table 1.

The distributions of 3σ IMBH mass limits produced by these simulations are lognormal, with σ= 0.39 dex. This lognormal form and scatter are set by the prior distribution for fb, which is by far the dominant source of uncertainty. This can be readily seen as the inferred IMBH mass depends on the assumptions as: [formula] (Maccarone & Servillat 2010); the scatter in the fundamental plane itself is a minor contribution to the overall uncertainty. Because of the weak sensitivity of the IMBH mass limits to the input parameters, one would need to assume extremely low values of the accretion rate (10- 3 to 10- 4 of the Bondi rate) or gas density to allow for the presence of [formula] IMBHs in these GCs.

Discussion

There are currently no undisputed cases of IMBHs in GCs.

Until recently, the best candidate was probably the massive cluster G1 in M31. An HST dynamical estimate gave a mass of [formula] (Gebhardt et al. 2005), though this measurement is challenging because of the small sphere of influence of the IMBH (0.02-0.03arcsec). X-ray and radio emission associated with the GC were consistent with an IMBH of [formula] to [formula] (Pooley & Rappaport 2006; Kong et al. 2010; Ulvestad et al. 2007). However, new JVLA observations find no evidence of radio emission, and suggest that the earlier detection was spurious (Wrobel et al. 2012; J. Miller-Jones et al., in preparation). The X-ray emission (2  ×  1036 erg s- 1) is consistent with that from actively accreting low-mass X-ray binaries. Thus, the sole evidence supporting an IMBH in G1 is the dynamical measurement.

A number of Galactic GCs have dynamical evidence for a central mass concentration that is often interpreted as an IMBH. These include ω Cen, for which there is an unresolved discrepancy between ground-based kinematics studies that find an IMBH of mass ~   4-5 [formula] (Noyola et al. 2010; Noyola et al. 2008) and HST stellar proper motions that set an IMBH upper limit of ~   1-2 [formula] (van der Marel & Anderson 2010). Part of the problem is that there is a disagreement on the location of the center of the cluster, although this cannot account for the whole discrepancy.

Lützgendorf et al. (2011) report a 2σ dynamical measurement of a [formula] IMBH in the massive bulge GC NGC 6388. In the Sgr dwarf GC M54, Ibata et al. (2009) report a central velocity dispersion peak that could be due to an IMBH of [formula]. These measurements can be improved by future data--especially the combination of radial velocities and proper motions--but will still be fundamentally limited by the small size of the IMBH sphere of influence.

In M15, Gerssen et al. (2003, see also Baumgardt et al. 2003 and references therein) found marginal evidence for a [formula] from HST/STIS spectroscopy but note that a population of "dark remnants", such as neutron stars, is a viable explanation for their data.

A few GCs have had dynamical studies that yielded interesting upper limits on IMBH masses. Notably, in 47 Tuc, McLaughlin et al. (2006) set a 1σ upper limit of 1000-1500 [formula] on the basis of HST proper motions; this cluster also has the tightest X-ray upper limit on a central IMBH (Grindlay et al. 2001); the 3σ radio limit using our assumptions is 1050 [formula] (Lu & Kong 2011).

In none of these cases are the dynamical detections consistent with constraints derived from radio observations (for other papers, we translate the flux densities into IMBH mass limits using our generally more conservative formalism). In ω Cen, Lu & Kong (2011) report a 3σ limit of 21 μJy beam- 1 at 5.5 GHz, equivalent to an IMBH mass limit of [formula]. For NGC 6388, the 3σ 5.5 GHz ATCA limit of 42.3 μJy beam- 1 in Bozzo et al. (2011) corresponds to an IMBH mass limit of [formula]. Wrobel et al. (2011) give a 3σ VLA limit of 51 μJy beam- 1 for M54; because of the distance of this GC, the mass limit is larger: [formula]. And as discussed above, the new radio data in this paper constrains an M15 IMBH to [formula] at the 3σ evel.

For ω Cen and NGC 6388 these limits are a factor of ten (or more) lower than the published dynamical masses. In the cases of M54 and M15, the discrepancy is smaller but still present. These discrepancies are not easily addressed. For example, a [formula] IMBH in ω Cen would need to be shining at [formula] of the Bondi luminosity (the luminosity for ε  =  0.1 and Bondi accretion) to be consistent with the radio limits. This is orders of magnitude lower than even famous low-luminosity active galactic nuclei such as Sgr A* (mentioned above) and M31* (Garcia et al. 2010), which have X-ray luminosities ~  10- 5 to 10- 7 of the Bondi luminosity.

Alternatively, the GCs could have dramatically lower gas densities than expected, which would be surprising given the general agreement between the Pfahl & Rappaport (2001) model for mass loss and the existing pulsar observations. Additional gas density estimates from pulsar timing data would be extremely beneficial.

The joint constraints from previous radio data and our new deep JVLA observations provide strong evidence that either: (a) massive ([formula]) IMBHs are rare in GCs, or (b) any such IMBHs accrete at relative luminosities below that observed in even the lowest-luminosity galactic nuclei. We strongly support the acquisition of more deep radio continuum observations of Galactic GCs to improve the demographics of the cluster sample.
