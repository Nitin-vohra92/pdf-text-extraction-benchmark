Representatives of elliptic Weyl group elements in algebraic groups

Introduction

An element w of a Weyl group W is called elliptic if it has no eigenvalue 1 in the standard reflection representation. It is well known that the Coxeter elements provide examples of such elements, but in general they are not the only examples . If we think of W not as the Weyl group of a root system but as the quotient W = NG(T) / T in some semisimple algebraic group G with maximal torus T, the natural question arises whether representatives in G of elliptic elements have any nice properties. In this paper we determine the order of any representative in G of an elliptic element.

The classification of conjugacy classes in Weyl groups is provided in [\cite=carter72], where they are essentially classified by certain admissible diagrams, which we will call Carter diagrams. These diagrams are particularly useful in the present context since they make it easy to single out elliptic elements. The question of determining the order of representatives of elliptic elements was analyzed in [\cite=fedotov09], with some substantial results in certain cases. The cases of E6 and E7, however, proved particularly troublesome in that paper, and in the classical cases the focus was on the case when G is simple. In the present work, instead of analyzing the problem thinking of G as a matrix group, we use Chevalley generators and relations to calculate the order of any representative of an elliptic element. One surprising result is that if G is simple and w is elliptic with order d, then representatives g of w almost always have order d, with the only counterexamples arising in Cn and F4. A summary of results is given in Table [\ref=tab:final_chart]; see Definition [\ref=spin] for an explanation of the terminology in the table.

Weyl group elements with no eigenvalue 1 are called elliptic in [\cite=lusztig10] and generalized Coxeter elements in [\cite=dwyer99]. Here we will generally stick with "elliptic." If w is elliptic we will also refer to the conjugacy class of w in W as "elliptic" since eigenvalues are conjugation invariant. Our main references for facts about root systems and semisimple groups are [\cite=carter05] and [\cite=gls98]. We will use the numbering of the nodes of the Dynkin diagrams given in [\cite=carter05]. (Note that the numbering for E7 and E8 is different than that given in [\cite=gls98].)

Preliminary results

Let Φ be a reduced crystallographic root system with Weyl group W, K an algebraically closed field, and G a semisimple algebraic K-group with root system Φ. Let Gu be the corresponding universal group and Ga the adjoint group, as in [\cite=gls98]*Theorem 1.10.4. Then we have epimorphisms Gu  →  G  →  Ga with [formula] finite. In fact, G is always either Ga or Gu unless Φ has type An or Dn. Thus it is almost sufficient to just analyze Ga and Gu.

We will need to think of G in terms of Chevalley generators and relations, so we now establish some facts in that vein. Let T be a maximal torus in G and let xα(λ) denote the standard Chevalley generators, where α∈Φ and λ∈K. For each α∈Φ, λ∈K* define mα(λ): = xα(λ)x-  α( - λ- 1)xα(λ) and hα(λ): = mα(λ)mα( - 1). Let N: = 〈mα(λ)〉, and note that T = 〈hα(λ)〉 [\cite=gls98]*Theorem 1.12.1. It is a fact that [formula]; see [\cite=steinberg67]*Lemma 22. The following Chevalley relation, which we will need later, is established in the proof of [\cite=carter72book]*Lemma 7.2.2.

(CR1): For α,β∈Φ, mα(1)mβ(1)mα(1)- 1 = msαβ(c(α,β)) where [formula] is determined only by α and β.

This sign c(α,β) can sometimes be computed just from knowing the α-chain of roots through β. As we will see in Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute], if α and β are orthogonal then c(α,β) is "usually" 1, and by orthogonality sαβ  =  β so then mα(1) and mβ(1) actually commute. Details are given in Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute]. An immediate corollary to (CR1) is the following, which does not depend on c(α,β):

(CR2): For α,β∈Φ, mα(1)hβ( - 1)mα(1)- 1 = hsαβ( - 1).

We now define N0 to be 〈mα(1)|α∈Φ〉 and T0 to be 〈hα( - 1)|α∈Φ〉. It is easy to see that [formula], by the same proof that [formula]. See also [\cite=abr11]*Lemma 4.2 and [\cite=gls98]*Remark 1.12.11. Since T0 is abelian and all its elements square to 1, we immediately see that any Weyl group element w of order d has at least one representative g0 of order either d or 2d.

For elliptic w, by [\cite=fedotov09]*Theorem 1 and, independently, [\cite=abr11]*Theorem 4.3, all representatives of w in N have the same order. In fact by the proof of [\cite=abr11]*Theorem 4.3, for any representative g, gd = gd0. Thus to determine the order of any representative g of an elliptic Weyl group element w with order d, it suffices to check whether gd0 = 1 or not, for g0∈N0 representing w. We encode this fact into the following proposition, which is proved in the sources mentioned above.

Let w∈W be an elliptic element with order d. Then all representatives of w in N have the same order. In particular they all have order d if gd0 = 1 and order 2d otherwise.

The converse of Proposition [\ref=reps_have_same_order] is also true for most K; that is, if w is not elliptic and if K contains an element of infinite order, then w has a representative of infinite order in N. This is proved in Theorem 4.3 in [\cite=abr11], but we will not need this fact here.

The elliptic elements are classified in [\cite=carter72], and to each conjugacy class of elliptic elements is assigned an "admissible diagram" Γ, which we call a Carter diagram. For w∈W = W(Φ), we can always find linearly independent roots [formula] such that [formula], and w is elliptic if and only if r = n where n is the rank of Φ [\cite=carter72]. In general Γ is constructed by taking a node for each βi and connecting βi to βj with a certain number of edges given by the same rule as for Dynkin diagrams (that is, depending on the angle between βi and βj). In particular if [formula] are the simple roots then [formula] is a Coxeter element and simply has Carter diagram equal to the Dynkin diagram of Φ. Another important case is when Φ contains n mutually orthogonal roots [formula]. In this case [formula] is the negative identity element - I in W, with Carter diagram An1, i.e., n unconnected nodes. It is possible that two elements in W can have the same Carter diagram without being conjugate, but this will never happen for elliptic elements [\cite=carter72].

At this point for the sake of brevity we introduce the following definitions:

Let w∈W be elliptic with order d. If all representatives of w in G have order d we say w has spin 1. If all representatives of w have order 2d we say w has spin - 1. Note that this is a property of w and of G, not just of w. Thus we will often need to refer to G-spin, adjoint spin, or universal spin. Spin is of course preserved by conjugation, so we may also refer to the spin of a conjugacy class or Carter diagram. Furthermore, if w∈W is elliptic with order d and g0∈N0 represents w, we will call gd0∈T0 the spin signature of w. This doesn't depend on the choice of g0, and so is well defined.

Unlike spin, the spin signature may not be conjugation invariant. In practice we will often find that the spin signature of w is central in G, in which case we can refer to the spin signature of a conjugacy class or Carter diagram. In Section [\ref=sec:cox_elts] we will present a labeling of the Carter diagram of w that helps to calculate the spin signature. First we establish a few results that simplify things considerably.

Let w∈W be elliptic with odd order d. Then w has spin 1.

Let g0∈N0 represent w, so gd0∈T0. Since (g0gd0)d = gd0, in fact gd20 = 1. But since d is odd this means that g0 cannot have order 2d, and so has order d.

For any w∈W and [formula], if w and wr are both elliptic then w has the same spin and spin signature as wr.

Say w has order d and spin 1. Then any representative g of w in N has order d, so gr has the same order as wr implying that wr has spin 1. The spin - 1 case follows by a parallel argument, and the fact that the spin signatures are the same is immediate.

Let w1 and w2 be elements of W. If there exists [formula] such that wr1 = w2 or wr2 = w1 then we will call w1 and w2 linked. Similarly we may refer to the corresponding conjugacy classes as linked if there exist representatives from each class that are linked. The point is that linked classes have equal spins, and linked elements have equal spins and spin signatures.

To tell whether two elliptic classes are linked we will often make use of Table 3 in [\cite=carter72], which lists the characteristic polynomials of elliptic elements. Knowing the eigenvalues of an elliptic element w allows us to easily check which powers wr are elliptic, and to identify the conjugacy class of wr. For example if the eigenvalues of w are all primitive 2rth roots of unity, then wr =  - I and w is linked to - I.

Suppose - I∈W. Then any representative g of - I in N satisfies g2∈Z(G). In particular if G is simple then - I has spin 1.

Since g2 = g20 for g0∈N0 representing - I, without loss of generality g∈N0. By [\cite=carter72book]*Lemma 7.2.1(i), we thus have gxα(λ)g- 1 = x-  α(εαλ), where [formula] depends on g and α but not on λ or G. Similarly g2xα(λ)g- 2 = xα(εαε-  αλ). By however, ε-  α  =  εα, and so actually g2xα(λ)g- 2 = xα(λ). Since the xα(λ) generate G, as explained in [\cite=gls98]*Remark 1.12.3, indeed g2∈Z(G).

If G is simple then any elliptic element w of W that is linked to - I∈W has spin 1.

We can calculate the spin of many elliptic conjugacy classes using just Corollaries [\ref=odd_order] and [\ref=simple_-I]. For those classes that cannot be dealt with using just these two corollaries, we need to do a bit of computation. To help with this we transcribe a version of Table 1.12.6 in [\cite=gls98], listing all elements of order 2 in Z(Gu). We will use the numbering of the simple roots αi given in Section [\ref=sec:intro]. For each [formula] let hi: = hαi( - 1).

Spin signatures of Coxeter elements

At this point we declare that we only consider fields K with characteristic different than 2. If the characteristic is 2 then T0  =  {1}, and all elliptic elements have spin 1, so this case is trivial.

Let α,β be orthogonal roots in a root system Φ. If the α-chain of roots through β is just β, then = 1.

Since the α-chain of roots through β is just β, c(α,β) = 1 by the proof of [\cite=carter72book]*Proposition 6.4.3. Since α,β are orthogonal, sαβ  =  β, and so by (CR1) indeed = 1.

This holds for example if α and β are orthogonal long roots. Also, if Φ is simply laced then any two orthogonal roots will have this property. The next lemma is a version of [\cite=gls98]*Theorem 1.12.1(e), which is standard, and we will not prove it here.

For any root α, if [formula] then [formula].

Let w∈W be elliptic with order d, and let Γ be its Carter diagram. Let [formula] be a decomposition of Γ into connected components. Note that roots labeling nodes of different components Γi are orthogonal. We know that [formula] where each wi has Carter diagram Γi and all the wi commute with each other (though note that the wi are not elliptic). Let di denote the order of wi, so d is the least common multiple of the di.

If Γ' is the Carter diagram of w'∈W and w' has order d', define the content of Γ' to be the power of 2 in the prime factorization of d'. If [formula] and [formula] as above then any Γi with the same content as Γ will be called a relevant component. All other Γi will be called irrelevant.

The point of this definition is that if Γi is an irrelevant component, with gi∈N0 representing wi, then

[formula]

since gdii∈T0 and 2 divides d / di. Thus the irrelevant components in some sense do not contribute to the spin signature of w.

Consider an elliptic element w in W = W(C6) with Carter diagram Γ = C2  ×  C4. (This exists by [\cite=carter72]*Proposition 24.) If w = w1w2 is the corresponding decomposition, we see that w1 has order 4 and w2 has order 8, so w has order 8 and the C2 factor of Γ is irrelevant. If g0 = g1g2 is the corresponding representative of w = w1w2 in N0 then g81 = 1. It turns out the gi commute (see Section [\ref=sec:C]), so g80 = g82.

To calculate gd0 in general we need to find a way to calculate these powers of representatives of relevant components, and then combine them in the correct way. Let Γi be a relevant component that is itself a Dynkin diagram, and let wi be as above. Without loss of generality we may assume wi has order d. Let [formula] be the roots labeling each node. For our representative of wi in N0 we take [formula], where mj: = mβj(1). Let [formula] where sj = sβj, and let W': = 〈S'〉. Then W' is a Weyl subgroup of W and (W',S') is a spherical Coxeter system with Coxeter diagram Γi. To calculate gdi we will use (CR2), and a series of relations that are closely related to the defining relations of W'.

First, we make the assumption that if βj and βk are orthogonal, then mj and mk commute, for all 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  ni. This assumption will need to be checked on a case-by-case basis using Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute], but at least if Φ is simply connected we get it for free. This mirrors the relation (sjsk)2 = 1 in W', and we also have an immediate analogue to the relation s2j = 1, namely m2j = hβj( - 1), which is just true by construction. This leaves the braid relations involving non-orthogonal roots.

Let βj and βk be non-orthogonal roots labeling nodes of Γi. Since W' is a Weyl subgroup of W, (sjsk) must have order either 3, 4, or 6. The order 6 case corresponds to a triple edge between the two nodes, which only appears if Φ is G2, and this case is easily covered in Section [\ref=sec:G2] using only Corollary [\ref=odd_order]. As such we can ignore this case, and assume the nodes have either a single edge or a double edge.

With notation as above, if βj and βk label nodes connected by a single edge then (mjmk)3 = 1, and if they label nodes connected by a double edge, with βk the short root, then (mjmk)4 = (mkmj)4 = hβk( - 1).

First suppose it is a single edge, so (sjsk) has order 3. Note that mkmj = mskβj(c(βk,βj))mk by (CR1). Also, by Proposition 6.4.3 in [\cite=carter72book], c(βj,βk) =  - c(βk,βj) and c(βk,βj)c(βk,skβj) =  - 1. Thus

[formula]

In other words, the braid relation sjsksj = sksjsk lifts to mjmkmj = m- 1km- 1jm- 1k in N0.

Now suppose it is a double edge, so (sjsk) has order 4, and assume βk is the short root. Proposition 6.4.3 in [\cite=carter72book] tells us that now c(βk,βj)c(βk,skβj) = 1, and that mk(λ)msjβk(μ) = msjβk( - μ)mk(λ). By repeated application of (CR1) we thus get that

[formula]

In other words, the braid relation sjsksjsk = sksjsksj lifts to

[formula]

in N0. Since (mkmj)4 just equals mk(mjmk)4m- 1k we also immediately get that (mkmj)4 = hβk( - 1).

Note that these relations, plus (CR2), really are sufficient to calculate gdi. This is because the corresponding relations in W' are sufficient to prove wdi = 1, and then (CR2) is enough to identify the correct element of T. It is very important that these relations are completely local, i.e., they only depend on the roots involved and not on the global structure of Φ, and in particular don't require us to know the sign of any c(α,β). The only assumption we have made is that any mj,mk corresponding to orthogonal βj,βk should commute. The fact that these relations only depend on the roots means that, to calculate gdi for a relevant component Γi that is a Dynkin diagram, we can actually just calculate the spin signature of a Coxeter element in the Weyl group with Γi as its Dynkin diagram. This will work as long as we choose gi correctly, i.e., as a product of mα(1) where α ranges over Γi. For example, it turns out that Coxeter elements in W(A3) have spin signature h1h3, and so if some relevant component Γi is of type A3 and is labeled by β1,β2,β3 (and if mβ1 and mβ3 commute), then gdi = hβ1( - 1)hβ3( - 1). We can then use Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples] to express gdi as a product of hj.

To illustrate that we can calculate gdi without knowing the various c(α,β), we do the example of A3 here (with d = 4).

Suppose β1,β2,β3 are roots labeling nodes in Γ such that

[formula]

is a connected component of Γ. Let mi = mβi(1) and assume that m1 and m3 commute. We now show that (m1m2m3)4 = hβ1( - 1)hβ3( - 1), using only the relations m2i = hβi( - 1), m1m2m1 = m- 12m- 11m- 12, m2m3m2 = m- 13m- 12m- 13, m1m3 = m3m1, and (CR2). For brevity we will write hi for hβi( - 1), but note that βi probably is different than the simple root αi in Φ.

[formula]

The last two lines made repeated use of (CR2) and Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples].

We could theoretically develop an algorithm to calculate the spin signatures of Coxeter elements for any Φ in this way, but this would not be a realistic way to calculate the spin of an arbitrary elliptic element. The point is that since any such calculations depend only on the roots in the diagram and not on Φ, we don't have to do this, provided we can calculate the spin signatures of Coxeter elements some other way. We can in fact do this for An - 1, Bn, Cn, and E7, and this turns out to be sufficient.

Coxeter elements in An - 1

The results for this case are well-known but we present them for completeness. By Proposition 23 in [\cite=carter72], the Coxeter elements are the only elliptic elements in W = W(An - 1). Thinking of W as Sn, these are precisely the n-cycles. If n is odd then these all have odd order and thus spin 1 by Corollary [\ref=odd_order]. Suppose now that n is even. By [\cite=gls98]*Theorem 1.10.7(a) we know that G is a quotient of [formula] by a central subgroup Z'. Let w be a Coxeter element and g0 a representative in N0. Since w is an odd permutation, and g0 has determinant 1, we see that an odd number of entries of g0 are -1. Thus gn0 =  - In, and so w has spin 1 if - In∈Z' and spin - 1 if [formula]. In particular all elliptic elements of W(An - 1) have universal spin - 1 if n is even. Also note that when n is even, - In is the unique element of order 2 in Z(Gu), so by Table [\ref=tab:center] the spin signature gn0 must equal [formula]. In particular in the A3 case we get h1h3, as referenced earlier.

Coxeter elements in Bn

Let w∈W = W(Bn) be a Coxeter element, with order 2n. Since w has characteristic polynomial tn + 1, w is linked to - I, and any representative of w raised to the 2n will equal g20, where g0 represents - I in N0. It thus suffices to calculate g20. Let [formula] be the orthonormal basis of roots given in [\cite=carter05]*Section 8.3, so [formula] and [formula] where mi: = mβi(1). Note that for any i  ≠  j, the βj-chain of roots through βi is βi  -  βj,βi,βi  +  βj, and βi,βj are orthogonal. Thus by the proof of Proposition [\cite=carter72book]*Proposition 6.4.3, mimβj(ε)m- 1i = mβj( - ε) for [formula]. Moreover, it is straightforward to calculate that for any i, hβi( - 1) = hn. We can now calculate g20.

[formula]

where [formula]. Since hn∈Z(Gu) by Table [\ref=tab:center], this tells us that - I, and thus any Coxeter element, has adjoint spin 1. In the universal case the spin is 1 if and only if n is congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 4.

Coxeter elements in Cn

As in the Bn case, we need to calculate g20, where g0 represents - I. We claim that [formula] where [formula]. Let [formula] denote the orthonormal basis of [formula] given in [\cite=carter05]*Section 8.4, so [formula] and [formula] where mi: = m2βi(1). Since the 2βi are all long and are mutually orthogonal, they have trivial root chains through each other and so the mi all commute by Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute]. Thus [formula]. Now, for each i, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples] then, [formula]. The result now follows immediately. As a consequence we see that - I, and thus all Coxeter elements in W(Cn), have universal spin - 1, and adjoint spin 1 by Table [\ref=tab:center].

Coxeter elements in E7

In type E7, the eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are the primitive 18th roots of unity and -1, so a Coxeter element to the 9th power equals - I. Since linked elements have the same spin, as before we actually want to calculate the spin of - I. Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis of [formula], with the simple roots given by α1 = e1 - e2, α2 = e2 - e3, α3 = e3 - e4, α4 = e4 - e5, α5 = e5 - e6, α6 = e5 + e6, [formula]. (This is as in [\cite=carter05]*Section 8.7, though we use different notation.) If we then let β1 = e1 - e2, β2 = e1 + e2, β3 = e3 - e4, β4 = e3 + e4, β5 = e5 - e6, β6 = e5 + e6, β7 =  - e7 - e8, the βi are mutually orthogonal so [formula].

Let [formula] represent - I in N0, where mi: = mβi(1). Since E7 is simply laced, by Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute] [formula]. Now, β1  =  α1, β2  =  α1 + 2α2 + 2α3 + 2α4  +  α5  +  α6, β3  =  α3, β4  =  α3 + 2α4  +  α5  +  α6, β5  =  α5, β6  =  α6, and β7  =  α1 + 2α2 + 3α3 + 4α4 + 2α5 + 3α6 + 2α7, and so by Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples], g20 = h1h3h5. By Table [\ref=tab:center] this is precisely the non-trivial element of the center. So - I has universal spin - 1 and adjoint spin 1.

Orders and spin signatures of elliptic elements

Let w∈W be elliptic with order d, and let Γ be its Carter diagram. Let [formula] be a decomposition of Γ into connected components. Since we only care about the roots labeling the nodes of the relevant components inasmuch as they yield a certain product of hj according to Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples], we devise the following convenient way to label Carter diagrams, which we will call a spin labeling. If a node is labeled with the root α, we re-label it with the tuple [formula] such that [formula]. If α  =  αi is simple, we just maintain the original "i" label. We will only need to worry about Γi that are Dynkin diagrams, so the spin signature gdi is just the product of hj where j ranges in the appropriate way over the spin labeling of Γi. For instance if Γi is

[formula]

and relevant, then gdi = (h1h3)(h2h3h4) = h1h2h4, since Γi has type A3.

These spin labelings are really only useful when Γ is the Dynkin diagram of a Weyl subgroup of W, which is equivalent to saying that Γ is cycle-free [\cite=carter72]*Lemma 8. Luckily, it will turn out that for all examples where Γ has cycles, we can find its spin just using Corollaries [\ref=odd_order] and [\ref=simple_-I]. Since Carter diagrams that are Dynkin diagrams all arise by an iterated process of removing nodes from extended Dynkin diagrams, we are especially interested in the spin labeling of nodes corresponding to [formula], where [formula] is a highest root. In the Bn case it will be convenient to instead use the highest short root [formula]. We collect here the decompositions of negative highest roots into simple roots, only for the cases we will actually use.

The spin labeled extended Dynkin diagrams that we will need later can now be found using Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples], and are exhibited below. Our general reference for the extended Dynkin diagrams is the Appendix in [\cite=carter05]. Note that the diagram we need for Bn actually has the negative highest short root added.

[formula]

It is certainly possible that a given Carter diagram Γ could have more than one spin labeling. For example the Carter diagram C2  ×  A1 in type C3 could have either of the spin labelings below.

[formula]

The first is obtained by removing the node labeled "2" from the extended Dynkin diagram, and the second by removing the node labeled "1."

Luckily, as we will see, the spin signature is almost always central and so different spin labelings will still produce the same spin signature. The example given here is one of the few for which different spin labelings produce different spin signatures, namely h1 and h2, as seen in Section [\ref=sec:C]. In any case, to at least calculate the spin it doesn't matter which spin labeling we pick for our Carter diagram.

We can now calculate the spin and spin signature of all elliptic elements in any Weyl group. Let w∈W be elliptic with order d, and let Γ be its Carter diagram. Let [formula] be a decomposition of Γ into connected components. We know that [formula] where each wi has Carter diagram Γi and all the wi commute with each other. Let di denote the order of wi, so d is the least common multiple of the di.

The An - 1 case

All elliptic elements are Coxeter elements, and so we already calculated their spin and spin signature in Section [\ref=sec:ACox].

The Bn case

In [\cite=fedotov09] it is shown that all elliptic elements in W = W(Bn) have adjoint spin 1. We now have the tools to calculate the universal spin of any elliptic element, with the adjoint case as a corollary. Note that these are the only two cases since |Z(Gu)| = 2. By [\cite=carter72]*Proposition 24, each Γi is a Dynkin diagram of type Bni for some ni, and [formula]. Here B1 is identified with [formula], a single node corresponding to a short root. By Proposition 24 and Table 2 in [\cite=carter72] each Γ arises by an iterated process of attaching a node for the negative highest short root and removing a node. As seen in the previous section, these new nodes will all have spin labeling "n." If gi is the usual representative of wi in N0, it is thus easy to calculate gdi using Section [\ref=sec:BCox]. The problem though is that the result of Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute] does not hold, since the negative highest short roots introduced do not have trivial root chains through each other. Luckily by Table [\ref=tab:center] hn is central, and so it is not too difficult to calculate the spin signature of w explicitly.

Let g0∈N0 represent w. Let f be the number of relevant Γi such that [formula]. If [formula] or [formula] then set e: = f. If [formula] and [formula] then set e: = f + 1. Note that d is even so these are the only possibilities.

With the above setup, gd0 = hen. In particular all elliptic w have adjoint spin 1.

For each i let gi∈N0 be the standard representative given by the product of mα(1) as α ranges over Γi. Without loss of generality [formula]. By Section [\ref=sec:BCox] and the fact that all nodes of Γ corresponding to short roots have spin labeling "n," it is immediate that [formula]. We now claim that for any i  ≠  j, gigjg- 1i = gjhn. Indeed, if Γi is labeled by the roots [formula] and Γj by [formula] (with βni and γnj short), then by Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute] mβk(1) commutes with [formula] for all [formula]. Also, the βni-chain of roots through γnj is γnj  -  βni,γnj,γnj  +  βni, so mβni(1)mγnj(1)mβni(1)- 1 = mγnj( - 1). Since mγnj( - 1) = mγnj(1)hγnj( - 1) and hγnj( - 1) = hn, in fact mβni(1)mγnj(1)mβni(1)- 1 = mγnj(1)hn. This proves our claim that gigjg- 1i = gjhn.

It is now a straightforward exercise to calculate [formula] in terms of [formula]. Since hn is central and T0 is abelian, we get the following:

[formula]

If [formula] or [formula], we see that gd0 = hfn = hen. If [formula] and [formula] then gd0 = hfnhn = hen.

Let w∈W(Bn) be elliptic with characteristic polynomial [formula]. Then w has spin signature hen where e is as in Theorem [\ref=type_B_complete].

By [\cite=carter72]*Proposition 24 w has Carter diagram of type [formula], and the result is immediate from Theorem [\ref=type_B_complete].

In summary, all elliptic elements in W(Bn) have adjoint spin 1, and we can calculate the universal spin just knowing the characteristic polynomial of w. Many conjugacy classes have universal spin 1, and many have universal spin - 1. We illustrate this with a few examples.

Let w∈W(B7) have characteristic polynomial (t3 + 1)(t3 + 1)(t+1). The spin labeled Carter diagram we use is

[formula]

All three components are relevant since they all have content 2. Since n1 = n2 = 3 and n3 = 1, we have f = 1. Also, since d = 6 and r = 3, we have e = f + 1 = 2. Thus w has spin signature h27 = 1, and so has universal spin 1. In the language of algebraic groups, any representative of w in [formula] has order 6, and even in [formula], any representative has order 6.

Let w∈W(B7) have characteristic polynomial (t6 + 1)(t + 1). The spin labeled Carter diagram we use is

[formula]

Only the first component is relevant, and n1 = 6, so f = 1. Also, since d = 12 and r = 2 we have e = f = 1. Thus w has spin signature h7, and so has universal spin - 1. In particular any representative of w in [formula] has order 12 but any representative in [formula] actually has order 24.

The name "spin" is slightly justified now. Indeed, it in some sense measures the tendency of representatives in [formula] of elliptic w to pick up an extra "twist" when lifting to [formula], that is, the order doubles. As we have seen not every w has this property, but we can tell which ones do just based on their characteristic polynomials, so this really is an inherent property of w.

The Cn case

The universal case is covered in [\cite=fedotov09], with the conclusion that all elliptic elements have universal spin - 1. While we could realize Gu and Ga explicitly as [formula] and [formula], we find that to cover the general case it is convenient to just deal directly with Carter diagrams. The result we find is the following

Let w∈W(Cn) be elliptic. Then w has universal spin - 1, and has adjoint spin 1 if and only if wr =  - I∈W for some r.

As in the Bn case, the Carter diagrams for elements of W = W(Cn) all arise by removing nodes from extended Dynkin diagrams. This time though, we will use the negative highest roots instead of the negative highest short roots. Now each Γi is Cni for some ni, and [formula] [\cite=carter72]*Proposition 24. (We identify C1 with A1.) Since we only ever introduce long roots, every short root corresponding to a node of Γ must actually be one of the simple roots [formula]. We claim that if two roots α,β corresponding to nodes of Γ are orthogonal, then the α-chain through β is just β. This is clear if either α or β is long. Also, if both roots are short, they are both simple, and orthogonal simple roots satisfy this property. In any case, if α and β are orthogonal then by Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute], = 1. Let gi be the usual representative of wi and let [formula] represent w, so [formula].

First note that the characteristic polynomial of wi is tni + 1, and so w is linked to - I if and only if every Γi is relevant. If w is linked to - I then by Section [\ref=sec:CCox], w has spin signature [formula], so w has adjoint spin 1 and universal spin - 1. Now suppose w is not linked to - I. We know that gd0 is the product of the gdi ranging over all i such that Γi is relevant. Also, for each relevant Γi, ni must be even since otherwise all wj would have order congruent to 2 mod 4, implying that all Γi are relevant and w in fact is linked to - I. By Section [\ref=sec:CCox], gdi is a product of hα( - 1) where α ranges over every other root of Γi, beginning with the terminal short root. Also, since ni is even for relevant Γi, all such α are short roots and thus simple roots. This tells us that gd0 is a product of hα( - 1) as α ranges over every simple root contained in a relevant Γi. Such an i exists, and so immediately we see that [formula], and w has universal spin -1. By Table [\ref=tab:center], it now suffices to show that for some [formula], the simple root αj is not a node in any relevant Γi.

Indeed, since w is not linked to - I we know there exists some irrelevant Γi. The only way Γi can avoid containing a node αj for odd j is if ni = 2 and the two nodes of Γi are a long root and some [formula] for even [formula]. But then one of [formula] or [formula] must have been removed from the graph, or else Γi would not be a connected component of Γ. We conclude that gd0 cannot equal [formula], and so w has adjoint spin - 1.

The last paragraph of the proof does not explicitly calculate the spin signature gd0, and indeed since the spin signatures are non-central, conjugate Weyl group elements may have different spin signatures.

In C6, consider the conjugacy class with Carter diagram C2  ×  C4. Any corresponding element w has order 8. One spin labeling of the Carter diagram is

[formula]

and only the C4 component is relevant, so g80 = h3h5, which is not central. Thus w has spin - 1, even in the adjoint case.

In C8, consider an element w with Carter diagram C2  ×  C6 with spin labeling

[formula]

and order 12. Now both components are relevant, so g120 = h1h3h5h7, which is a nontrivial element of Z(Gu). Thus w has adjoint spin 1 and universal spin -1.

It turns out the Cn case provides the only source of elliptic Weyl group elements with adjoint spin - 1, except for one conjugacy class in F4. The Cn case is also the only case where every elliptic element has universal spin - 1.

The Dn case

Certain cases are essentially done in [\cite=fedotov09], though there are no results there for the universal case. Unfortunately, type Dn is the only classical type in which not every elliptic Carter diagram arises by removing nodes from extended Dynkin diagrams, and applying our present approach to diagrams with cycles would be very difficult. However, having completely handled the Bn case we can now just use the natural embeddings W(Dn)  ≤  W(Bn) and Gu(Dn)  ≤  Gu(Bn) to figure out the spin of any w∈W(Dn). Indeed, if w∈W(Dn) is elliptic then it is also an elliptic element in W(Bn), so we know its spin and spin signature in Gu(Bn) just from its characteristic polynomial. Then since all the spin signatures are central they are independent of the choice of representative g0, and we can choose a representative in Gu(Dn), which tells us the spin and spin signature in Gu(Dn), though we have to use Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples] to express the spin signature in the correct notation. As an example we show the case of Coxeter elements in W(Dn).

Let w∈W = W(Dn) be a Coxeter element. Then w has characteristic polynomial (tn - 1 + 1)(t + 1), and so as an element of W' = W(Bn), w has spin labeled Carter diagram

[formula]

So as not to confuse central elements of Gu(Bn) and Gu(Dn) we will use [formula] for the central element of Gu(Bn). Direct calculation shows that e equals 0, 1, 2, or 3, if n is congruent modulo 4 to 1, 3, 0, or 2, respectively. Thus the spin signature of w in Gu(Bn) is either 1 or [formula], if [formula] or [formula], respectively.

Now to figure out the spin signature of w in Gu(Dn) we need to calculate [formula] in terms of the hi. We know that Φ(Dn) is the subroot system of Φ(Bn) consisting of the long roots, with fundamental roots [formula]. The root αn equals [formula], and so by Lemma [\ref=h_into_simples], [formula]. Converting to the standard numbering of fundamental roots in Φ(Dn), this equals hn - 1hn, one of the central elements in Gu(Dn).

Coxeter elements in W(Dn) have adjoint spin 1, and have universal spin 1 or -1, if [formula] or [formula], respectively. Moreover, if the universal spin is -1 then the spin signature is hn - 1hn.

Note that if n is even, Gu has two central elements of order 2 other than hn - 1hn, but they will never appear as spin signatures of elliptic elements.

The G2 case

The G2 case was completely dealt with in [\cite=fedotov09] using a different method, but we will present it for completeness. The Weyl group W = W(G2) is just the dihedral group of order 12. The Coxeter element w is the rotation of order 6, and a complete list of elliptic elements is given by w,w2,w3,w4,w5; in particular they are all linked. Since w2 has order 3 it has spin 1 by Corollary [\ref=odd_order], and so by Lemma [\ref=powers_spin] all elliptic elements have spin 1.

The F4 case

The F4 case is partially covered in [\cite=fedotov09], in particular it is shown that any elliptic power of a Coxeter element has spin 1. Here we show that one elliptic conjugacy class has spin - 1 and all others have spin 1. First note that - I∈W = W(F4) and G is simple, so by Corollary [\ref=simple_-I] any elliptic w linked to - I will have spin 1. By Carter's classification in [\cite=carter72], there are 9 elliptic conjugacy classes in W, and inspecting Tables 3 and 8 in [\cite=carter72] it is clear that 7 of these are linked to - I. The two remaining classes have Carter diagram [formula] and [formula], where a tilde indicates the roots labeling the nodes are short. Elements corresponding to the first diagram have odd order and thus spin 1 by Corollary [\ref=odd_order]. This leaves the single class with diagram [formula] having unknown spin. Let w be an element of this class, so w has order 4 and spin labeled diagram

[formula]

Inspecting the root system for F4, it is clear that the α4-chain of roots through any of [formula] consists of a single root. The same is true of α2 and [formula], and so the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=orth_m_commute] holds. Since the [formula] component is irrelevant, this implies that g40 = (h2h4)h2 = h4. We conclude that w actually has spin - 1 in this case. Also note that different spin labelings may yield different (through still non-trivial) spin signatures.

The E6 case

This is the first case for which no results were found in [\cite=fedotov09]. However, we can now completely handle this case, with the result that all elliptic elements have spin 1. By Carter's classification in [\cite=carter72], there are 5 elliptic conjugacy classes in W = W(E6), and inspecting Tables 3 and 9 in [\cite=carter72] it is clear that 4 of these are linked to the class with Carter diagram A32. Elements of this class have order 3, and so have spin 1 by Corollary [\ref=odd_order]. This leaves only the class with diagram A1  ×  A5 having unknown spin. Let w be a representative of this class, so w has order 6. A spin labeling of the Carter diagram is

[formula]

Since E6 is simply laced and both components are relevant,

[formula]

Thus all elliptic elements in W(E6) have spin 1, in both the adjoint and universal case.

The E7 case

Like E6, no results were found in [\cite=fedotov09] for the E7 case. Since |Z(Gu)| = 2, G must be either Ga or Gu. In Table 10 of [\cite=carter72] the elliptic conjugacy classes in W = W(E7) are classified, and in Table 3 in [\cite=carter72] the corresponding characteristic polynomials are given, so we can tell which elliptic elements are linked to each other. If [formula] denote choices of representatives of each elliptic conjugacy class, in the order given in [\cite=carter72], then w1 =  - I is linked to wi for i = 5,6,7,8,9,11,12, and w2 is linked to w10. By Section [\ref=sec:E7Cox] then, wi has universal spin - 1 and adjoint spin 1 for i = 1,5,6,7,8,9,11,12. We now determine the spin of wi for i = 2,3,4,10.

First consider w2, which has order 4, Carter diagram A23  ×  A1, and spin labeling

[formula]

The A1 component is irrelevant, so g40 equals h1h3h6(h1h3h6), which is 1. Thus w2 (and consequently w10) has spin 1.

Next consider w3, with order 6, Carter diagram A5  ×  A2, and spin labeling

[formula]

The A2 component is irrelevant, so g60 = h1h3h5. But this is precisely the non-trivial element of Z(Gu), by Table [\ref=tab:center]. So w3 has universal spin - 1 and adjoint spin 1.

Lastly consider w4, with order 8, Carter diagram A7, and spin labeling

[formula]

Then g80 = h1h3h6(h1h3h6) = 1, so w4 has spin 1.

In conclusion, w2, w4 and w10 always have spin 1, and all other elliptic elements have adjoint spin 1 and universal spin - 1.

The E8 case

As with the F4 case, in [\cite=fedotov09] it is indicated that powers of Coxeter elements have spin 1. Here we show that all elliptic elements have spin 1. Note that - I∈W = W(E8) and G is simple, so by Corollary [\ref=simple_-I] any elliptic w linked to - I will have spin 1. By Carter's classification in [\cite=carter72], there are 30 elliptic conjugacy classes in W. Choose representatives for each class, denoted [formula]. Inspecting Table 3 in [\cite=carter72] it is clear that wi is linked to w1 for all i except for i = 2,3,4,5,6,7,11,17,18,20,29. Since w1 =  - I the classes linked to w1 all have spin 1. Moreover for i = 2,4,7, wi has odd order so wi has spin 1, and for i = 17,18,29, wi is linked to w2 and so has spin 1. Also, the wi for i = 3,11,20,29 are all linked to w3, and w29 has spin 1 so all these wi do too. This leaves w5 and w6 as the only remaining cases, which we can handle using spin labelings.

First consider w5, with Carter diagram A5  ×  A1  ×  A2 and spin labeling

[formula]

The A2 component is irrelevant, so g60 = (h2h4h6)h2h4h6 = 1 and w5 has spin 1.

Lastly consider w6, with Carter diagram A7  ×  A1 and order 8 and spin labeling

[formula]

The A1 component is irrelevant, so g80 = (h2h4h6)h2h4h6 = 1 and w6 has spin 1.

It is remarkable that outside some cases in Cn and one case in F4, every elliptic conjugacy class has adjoint spin 1. We also see that universal spin - 1 occurs all the time in Cn, half the time in An - 1, never in E6, most of the time in E7, and quite often in Bn and Dn. It seems possible that these results could be proved without appealing the classification at all, but at present there is no general method that can handle every case. The following table summarizes our results:
