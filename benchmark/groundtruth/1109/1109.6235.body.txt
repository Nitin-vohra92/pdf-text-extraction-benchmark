Abstract

Magellanic Cloud brown dwarfs in the E-ELT Design Reference Mission

One of the projects proposed as part of the E-ELT Design Reference Mission (DRM) is the determination of the low-mass luminosity function down to the giant planet-mass regime in low-metallicity star-forming regions of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC,   =   - 0.33 dex) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC,   =   - 0.75 dex, [\citealt=roma]). Typical low-mass star-forming regions of the solar neighborhood, such as Lupus 3 or ρ-Ophiuchi, would subtend an angle of ~   2" at the distance of the Clouds, thus being appropriate for Laser Tomography Adaptive Optic (LTAO) observations, which would provide nearly diffraction-limited, deep near-infrared (NIR) imaging of the whole stellar and sub-stellar content of the cluster. In order to explore the detectability of the lowest-mass objects we simulate very young clusters similar to those found in the solar vicinity, without massive stars (M  <   2 [formula]) able to significantly ionize the gas, as this would dramatically increase the NIR background brightness via free-free emission. The challenge of the observations is the high density of objects (~   20 objects/arcsec2) and the fact that the members of the star-forming region cover a wide range in magnitudes, from K  ~  18 to K  ~   30 mag.

We simulate J,H,K-band images assuming different zenith distance values, in order to assess how much the location of the telescope will influence the observations, and different instrument pixel scales and stellar densities. We assume a distribution of stellar masses drawn from [\citet=chabrier2003] initial mass function truncated at 2 [formula]. Stars are randomly distributed over the 2"×  2" extent of the cluster and masses are transformed to J,H,K absolute magnitudes using a t  =  5 Myr isochrone from [\citet=baraffe2003]. A distance modulus of 18.5 mag is added plus a random extinction for each star. Variable background is introduced in some cases. All the simulations are performed adopting the technical assumptions of the official DRM data base (http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/science/drm/tech_data). Fig. [\ref=fig1] shows a composite J,H,K simulated image of a young star-forming region in the LMC.

We then perform crowded field photometry on the simulated images and compare the recovered luminosity function with the input one, in order to verify if giant planet-mass objects can be detected and measured with sufficient accuracy, i.e. S / N  >   5 (see Fig. [\ref=fig2]).

Conclusions

Our simulations show that nearly complete samples of young brown dwarfs above the deuterium burning limit (M  >   13 MJup) can be obtained in the Magellanic Cloud low-mass star-forming regions with E-ELT, and even giant planet-mass objects may be detected if the cluster nebulosity is sufficiently faint.
