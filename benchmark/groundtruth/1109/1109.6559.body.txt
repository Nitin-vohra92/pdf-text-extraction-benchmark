Coprime subdegrees for primitive permutation groups and completely reducible linear groups

Introduction

Completely reducible linear groups

In this paper we are concerned with the orbit lengths of a completely reducible linear group and with the subdegrees of a primitive permutation group. Given a field k, a kH-module V is said to be completely reducible if V is a direct sum of irreducible kH-modules. Furthermore, the set of subdegrees of a finite transitive permutation group G is the set of orbit lengths of the stabilizer Gω of a point ω.

Our first main result is a positive answer to a question of Gabriel Navarro [\cite=GN] about actions of a finite linear group. Indeed, Navarro asked whether a finite completely reducible kH-module V with two H-orbits of relatively prime lengths m and n has an orbit of size mn.

Let k be a field, let H be a finite group, let V be a completely reducible kH-module and let a and b be elements of V. If the H-orbits aH and bH have sizes m and n, and m,n are relatively prime, then [formula] and the H-orbit (a + b)H has size mn.

We note that Theorem [\ref=thm1] explicitly exhibits an H-orbit of size mn, namely the orbit containing a + b. Furthermore, Example [\ref=Exa1] shows that the "completely reducible" hypothesis in Theorem [\ref=thm1] is essential. Martin Isaacs [\cite=Isaacs3] has proved a similar result under stronger arithmetical conditions on m, n and the characteristic of k.

Our second main result is a somehow remarkable theorem (in our opinion) on irreducible linear groups. Theorem [\ref=thm2] shows that the groups arising in Theorem [\ref=thm1] are always reducible if n,m > 1.

Let k be a field, let H be a finite group, let V be a non-trivial irreducible kH-module and let a and b be in [formula]. Then the sizes of the H-orbits aH and bH have a non-trivial common factor.

The strategy for proving Theorem [\ref=thm2] is to reduce the problem inductively to the case where H is a non-abelian simple group which admits a maximal factorization H = AB with |H:A| relatively prime to |H:B|. Table [\ref=table] contains all such triples (H,A,B). In the case where H is a sporadic simple group, we use the information in Table [\ref=table] for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]. Furthermore, we observe that as a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm2], if (H,A,B) is one of the triples in Table [\ref=table], then there are no irreducible representations of H with A and B vector stabilizers.

A direct application of Theorem [\ref=thm2] gives the following corollary.

Let k be a field, let H be a finite group, let V be a non-trivial finite dimensional kH-module and let a and b be elements of V. If both H-orbits aH and bH span V, then |aH| and |bH| have a non-trivial common factor.

In the same direction as Corollary [\ref=cornew], in the case of p-soluble groups, we prove the following theorem.

Let k be a field of characteristic p  ≥  0, H a p-soluble finite group, V a kH-module and a∈V fixed by a Sylow p-subgroup of H and with the H-orbit aH spanning V. Then

[formula]; and

if b∈V and gcd (|aH|,|bH|) = 1, then b∈CV(H).

Here, by abuse of notation, "0-soluble finite group" means "finite group" and a "Sylow 0-subgroup" is the "identity subgroup". In the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:101] we do not make use of the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups. Moreover, since in an irreducible kH-module V every non-trivial H-orbit spans V, we see that Theorem [\ref=thm:101] (b) generalizes (for the class of p-soluble groups) Theorem [\ref=thm2] and, in particular, offers an independent and more elementary proof. Note that if p does not divide the order of H (including the case p = 0), then H is p-soluble, the Sylow p-subgroups of H are trivial and, in particular, Theorem [\ref=thm:101] applies in this situation.

Coprime subdegrees in primitive permutation groups

In the more general context of finite primitive permutation groups G, we investigate coprime subdegrees according to the O'Nan-Scott type of G. (We say that a subdegree d of G is non-trivial if d  ≠  1.) In particular, Theorem [\ref=thm2] yields that the primitive permutation group [formula] acting on V has no pair of non-trivial coprime subdegrees. One of the most important modern methods for analyzing a finite primitive permutation group G is to study the socle N of G, that is, the subgroup generated by the minimal normal subgroups of G. The socle of an arbitrary finite group is isomorphic to a direct product of simple groups, and, for finite primitive groups these simple groups are pairwise isomorphic. The O'Nan-Scott theorem describes in detail the embedding of N in G and collects some useful information on the action of N. In [\cite=Pr] eight types of primitive groups are defined (depending on the structure and on the action of the socle), namely HA (Holomorphic Abelian), AS (Almost Simple), SD (Simple Diagonal), CD (Compound Diagonal), HS (Holomorphic Simple), HC (Holomorphic Compound), TW (Twisted wreath), PA (Product Action), and it is shown in [\cite=LPS1] that every primitive group belongs to exactly one of these types.

Let G be a finite primitive permutation group. If G has two non-trivial coprime subdegrees, then G is of AS, PA or TW type. Moreover, for each of the O'Nan-Scott types AS, PA and TW, there exists a primitive group of this type with two non-trivial coprime subdegrees.

It is possible, for a single primitive group to have several different pairs of non-trivial coprime subdegrees. We give a construction of groups of PA type with this property in Example [\ref=exa3]. However, in the case of primitive groups of TW type, it is not possible to have as many as three pairwise coprime non-trivial subdegrees.

For a finite primitive permutation group of TW type, the maximal size of a set of pairwise coprime non-trivial subdegrees is at most 2.

Using the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups, we have proved the following theorem in [\cite=DGPS2].

Let G be a finite primitive permutation group. The maximal size of a set of pairwise coprime non-trivial subdegrees of G is at most 2.

Theorem [\ref=conj1] is related to a result on primitive groups first observed by Peter Neumann to be a consequence of a 1935 theorem of Marie Weiss. Its statement [\cite=Piter] is: if a primitive group has k pairwise coprime non-trivial subdegrees, then its rank is at least 2k. Theorem [\ref=conj1] shows that this result can only be applied with k = 1 or k = 2. In light of Theorems [\ref=thm3] and [\ref=TW], proving Theorem [\ref=conj1] reduces to consideration of primitive permutation groups of AS and PA type. In this paper we show that a proof of Theorem [\ref=conj1] reduces to a similar problem for transitive nonabelian simple permutation groups (it is this reduction that is used in [\cite=DGPS2] to prove Theorem [\ref=conj1]).

We announce here a proof of the following theorem about nonabelian simple groups (which again will be proved in [\cite=DGPS2]).

Let T be a transitive nonabelian simple permutation group and assume that the stabilizer of a point is pseudo-maximal in T. Then the maximal size of a set of pairwise coprime non-trivial subdegrees of T is at most 2.

Since a pseudo-maximal subgroup of T is not necessarily a maximal subgroup, we see that Theorem [\ref=conj3] is formally stronger than Theorem [\ref=conj1] for the class of nonabelian simple permutation groups. However, we prove in this paper that these two theorems are strongly related.

Theorem [\ref=conj1] follows from Theorem [\ref=conj3].

We conclude with a problem on relatively prime subdegrees in primitive groups. This problem is related to another classical result due to Marie Weiss [\cite=Piter]: if m and n are non-trivial coprime subdegrees of a primitive group G and m < n, then G has a subdegree d such that d divides mn and d > n. In Problem [\ref=conj2] we suggest that (apart a small list of exceptions) d can be chosen to be mn. Actually, we know only one almost simple group G where d cannot be taken to be nm.

We are grateful to Michael Giudici for providing this beutiful example.

We now give some examples which demonstrate that Theorem [\ref=conj1] is false for transitive groups that are not primitive. These examples show that there is no upper bound on the number of pairwise coprime non-trivial subdegrees for general transitive groups.

However, if we restrict to faithful subdegrees of a transitive group G, that is, subdegrees d such that there exists an orbit of length d of a stabilizer Gα on which Gα acts faithfully, then in fact we can show that a conclusion analogous to the statement of Theorem [\ref=conj1] does hold. We note that, in particular, every primitive permutation group has a faithful subdegree [\cite=Bob].

Let G be a finite transitive permutation group of degree n  >  1. Assume that G is not regular and let H be the stabilizer of a point. Then a set of faithful subdegrees that are pairwise coprime has size at most 2. Moreover, if the Fitting subgroup of H is non-trivial, then any two faithful subdegrees of G have a non-trivial common factor.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=cor:3] also yields the following result about field extensions.

Let k be a field and let [formula] be finite extensions of k all with the same normal closure K. Assume that the indices

[formula]

Structure of the paper

The structure of this paper is straightforward: we prove Theorem [\ref=thm2], Corollary [\ref=cornew] and Theorem [\ref=thm:101] in Section [\ref=secthm2]; we prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] in Section [\ref=secthm1]; we prove Theorem [\ref=thm3] in Section [\ref=secthm3]; we prove Theorems [\ref=TW] and [\ref=thm4] in Section [\ref=sec4]; we prove Theorems [\ref=cor:3] and [\ref=cor:4] in Section [\ref=CorProof]; and we give Table [\ref=table] in Section [\ref=sectable].

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm2] and [\ref=thm:101] and Corollary [\ref=cornew]

We say that a factorization H = AB is coprime if |H:A| is relatively prime to |H:B| and both A,B are proper subgroups of H. Also H = AB is maximal if A and B are maximal subgroups of H. We start by proving a preliminary theorem on finite classical groups. We let τ denote the transpose inverse map of [formula], that is, xτ = (xtr)- 1 where xtr is the transpose matrix of x. We denote by [formula] the conformal symplectic group, that is, the elements of [formula] preserving a given symplectic form up to a scalar multiple.

Let n  ≥  2.

We prove (a) and (b) first. Let [formula] be the algebraic group obtained by taking the algebraic closure k of the finite field [formula]. Let F:X  →  X be the Lang-Steinberg map obtained by raising each entry of a matrix x of X to the qth power, and G:X  →  X the Lang-Steinberg map [formula]. As usual, we denote by XF and by XG the fixed points of F and of G. In our case, we have [formula] and [formula]. Let x be in XF. Then xtr and x are clearly conjugate in the algebraic group X and hence also xτ = (xtr)- 1 and x- 1 are conjugate in X. Since the centralizer of any element of X is connected, it follows by the Lang-Steinberg theorem that xτ and x- 1 are conjugate in XF. Therefore x and x- 1 are conjugate in [formula] and (a) is proved. Now, let x be in XG. As we have noted in the proof of (a), the elements xτ and x- 1 are conjugate in the algebraic group X. It follows by the Lang-Steinberg theorem that xτ and x- 1 are conjugate in XG. Therefore x and x- 1 are conjugate in [formula] and (b) is proved.

(c) and (d), when q is even, are the main theorem of [\cite=Gow]. Finally, (c) and (d), when q is odd, are proved in [\cite=Won].

Given a field k and a kH-module V, we let [formula] denote the dual kH-module of V. Furthermore, we denote by VA the restriction of V to the subgroup A of H. Finally, if A is a subgroup of H and if V is a kA-module, then we denote by [formula] the module induced by V from A to H.

Suppose that H  =  AB is a factorization. If V is a non-trivial irreducible kH-module, then either A fixes no element of [formula] or B fixes no element of [formula].

We argue by contradiction and we assume that A fixes [formula] and that B fixes [formula].

Let Ω (respectively Δ) be the set of right cosets of A (respectively B) in H. Clearly, H acts transitively on Ω and Δ, and as H = AB, the group B is transitive on Δ and A is transitive on Ω. Let kHA (respectively kHB) be the permutation module for the action of H on Ω (respectively Δ). Since A is transitive on Δ, the multiplicity of the trivial kA-module k in (kHB)A is 1, that is, [formula]. From Frobenius reciprocity, it follows that [formula]. Therefore, the only H-homomorphism of kHA to kHB is the homomorphism φ with [formula] of codimension 1 in kHA and with [formula] the trivial submodule of kHB.

Since A fixes the non-zero vector a of V, we have [formula] and hence kHA has a homomorphic image isomorphic to V. Similarly, since B fixes the non-zero vector b of V*, we have [formula] and hence kHB has a homomorphic image isomorphic to V*. Using duality and the fact that [formula], we obtain that [formula] has a submodule isomorphic to [formula]. This shows that there exists an H-homomorphism ψ:kHA  →  kHB with [formula] and with [formula]. Since V is non-trivial, we obtain that [formula], a contradiction.

Here we say that a factorization H = AB is exact if [formula].

Suppose that H  =  AB is a coprime exact factorization. If V is a non-trivial irreducible kH-module, then either A or B fixes no element of [formula].

We argue by contradiction and we assume that both A and B fix some non-zero vector of V. Let r be the characteristic of the field k. Since |H:A| is relatively prime to |H:B| and [formula], we have that either r does not divide |A| or r does not divide |B|. Replacing A with B if necessary, we may assume that r does not divide |B|. Since the characteristic of k is coprime to the order of B, the module VB is a completely reducible kB-module. Therefore, [formula] where Wi is an irreducible kB-module, for each [formula]. Since B fixes a non-zero vector of V, we have that, for some [formula], Wi is a trivial kB-module. Now, [formula] and hence W*i is a trivial submodule of V*B. This shows that B fixes a non-zero vector of V*, but this contradicts Lemma [\ref=lemma1].

The following lemma is Lemma 5.1 in [\cite=GT].

Suppose that every element of H is conjugate to its inverse via an element of [formula]. If V is an irreducible kH-module, then [formula] for some [formula].

Write [formula]. We can view H as a subgroup of G. Since H is normal in G, from [\cite=GN1] we see that the module M = (VGH)H is completely reducible with irreducible summands Vx, for x∈G. Furthermore, since every element of H is conjugate to its inverse via an element of G, we obtain that the Brauer character of M is real valued. Now, from [\cite=GN1], we see that completely reducible modules with real Brauer characters are self dual and hence M is self dual, that is, [formula]. Hence V* is an irreducible direct summand of M, and so [formula] for some x∈G.

Suppose that every element of H is conjugate to its inverse via an element of [formula]. If H  =  AB is a coprime factorization and V is a non-trivial irreducible kH-module, then either A fixes no element of [formula] or B fixes no element of [formula].

From Lemma [\ref=GTlemma], [formula] for some [formula]. As H = AB is a coprime factorization, we obtain H  =  ABx.

We argue by contradiction and we assume that A fixes the non-zero vector a of V and that B fixes the non-zero vector b of V. So Bx fixes the vector bx of Vx and, as [formula], the group Bx fixes some non-zero vector of V*. This contradicts Lemma [\ref=lemma1] applied to G = ABx, and so the lemma is proven.

In the following proposition we prove Theorem [\ref=thm2] in the case that the group H is a non-abelian simple group.

Let H be a non-abelian simple group, V be a non-trivial irreducible kH-module, and a and b be in [formula]. Then the sizes of the H-orbits aH and bH have a non-trivial common factor.

We argue by contradiction and we assume that aH and bH have relatively prime sizes. Since [formula] and [formula] are coprime, [formula] is a coprime factorization. Now we use the classification of the finite simple groups.

If H is a classical group, we see from Theorem [\ref=thm8] that every element of H is conjugate to its inverse via an element of [formula]. Clearly, the same result holds true if H is an alternating group. Therefore, if H is a classical group or an alternating group, we obtain a contradiction from Lemma [\ref=idea] (applied with [formula] and [formula]). This shows that H is either an exceptional group of Lie type or a sporadic simple group. From Table [\ref=table], we see that exceptional groups of Lie type do not admit coprime factorizations. Therefore, H is a sporadic simple group. Again, using Table [\ref=table], we see that the only sporadic simple groups admitting a coprime factorization are M11,M23 and M24. In the rest of this proof we consider separately each of these groups. Note that Table [\ref=table] determines all possible coprime factorizations H = AB with A and B maximal in H.

Case H = M11. We first consider the case that [formula] and [formula]. We have |H:A| = 12, |H:B| = 11 and [formula]. As 2 and 3 divide |H:A| and as [formula] has no subgroups of index 5, in order to have [formula], we must have [formula]. Since |H:CH(b)| = |H:B| = 11 and [formula] is coprime to 11, the group [formula] has order divisible by 11 and hence it contains a Sylow 11-subgroup S. Now we have [formula] with [formula] and hence the result follows from Lemma [\ref=exact].

Now we consider the case that [formula] and [formula]. We have |H:A| = 12, |H:B| = 55 and [formula]. Since [formula], by coprimality we have [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and 55 divides [formula]. From the subgroup structure of A = L2(11), we see that [formula] contains a subgroup S of order 55. In particular, [formula] and [formula], and the result follows from Lemma [\ref=exact].

Case H = M23. In this case we have three maximal factorizations to consider. We start by studying the case that [formula] and [formula]. As |H:A| = 23 and [formula], we have that 23 divides [formula]. Let S be a Sylow 23-subgroup of [formula]. Now, [formula] and [formula], and the result follows as usual from Lemma [\ref=exact].

The other two maximal coprime factorizations of M23 in Table [\ref=table] are exact and hence the result follows again from Lemma [\ref=exact].

Case H = M24. We have [formula], [formula], |H:A| = 24, |H:B| = 1771 = 7  ·  11  ·  23 and [formula]. Since [formula] is divisible by 2 and 3, and [formula] is relatively prime to [formula], we have that [formula] contains a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup of H. Thus [formula] is divisible by 210  ·  33 and [formula]. Since B has no subgroup of index 5, we obtain [formula]. With a similar argument applied to [formula], we get that 7  ·  11  ·  23 divides [formula]. From [\cite=ATLAS], we see that M23 has no proper subgroup of order divisible by 7,11 and 23. Therefore [formula].

Let M be the permutation module kHA. (Thus M is the permutation module of the 2-transitive action of H on a set Ω of size 24. In particular, M is one of the modules investigated by Mortimer in [\cite=Mortimer].) Since A fixes the non-zero vector a of V, we have [formula] and so, from Frobenius reciprocity, we obtain [formula]. Hence the kH-module V is isomorphic to M / W, for some maximal kH-submodule W of M. Let (eω)ω∈Ω be the canonical basis of M and let p be the characteristic of k.

Let [formula], C  =  〈e〉 and [formula]. Clearly, C and [formula] are submodules of M. Assume that p  ≠  2,3. From [\cite=Mortimer], we see that the module M is completely reducible, [formula] and [formula] is an irreducible kH-module. Since V is a non-trivial kH-module, we obtain [formula]. Since M is self dual, we obtain that [formula] and hence [formula]. Therefore, since B fixes the non-zero vector b of V, it also fixes a non-zero vector of V*, but this contradicts Lemma [\ref=lemma1].

Now assume p = 3. From [\cite=Mortimer], we have that [formula] and [formula] is the unique maximal submodule of M. Therefore [formula] and [formula] is a trivial kH-module, a contradiction. Therefore it remains to consider the case p = 2.

Since 2 divides |Ω| = 24, we have [formula]. From [\cite=Klemm], we see that [formula] is the unique maximal submodule of M and hence [formula] is a trivial kH-module, a contradiction.

Now we are ready to prove Theorems [\ref=thm2], [\ref=thm:101] and Corollary [\ref=cornew].

We argue by contradiction and we let H be a minimal (with respect to the group order) counterexample. Let [formula] with |aH| relatively prime to |bH|.

If H is a cyclic group of prime order p, then every H-orbit on [formula] has size p, a contradiction. Similarly, from Proposition [\ref=thmHsimple] we see that the group H is not a non-abelian simple group. Thus H has a non-identity proper normal subgroup N. From the Clifford correspondence, [formula] with Wi a homogeneous kN-module, for each [formula], and with H acting transitively on the set of direct summands [formula] of V. (A module is said to be homogeneous if it is the direct sum of pairwise isomorphic submodules.) Write [formula] and [formula] with ai,bi∈Wi, for each [formula]. Let i and j be in [formula] with ai  ≠  0 and bj  ≠  0. Since H acts transitively on [formula], there exist h and k in H with Whi = W1 and Wkj = W1. In particular, replacing a and b by ah and bk if necessary, we may assume that i = j = 1. Since N is a normal subgroup of H, we get that |aN| divides |aH| (respectively |bN| divides |bH|). Furthermore, since N acts trivially on [formula], we obtain that [formula] and [formula], that is, |aN1| divides |aN| and |bN1| divides |bN|. In particular, |aN1| and |bN1| are coprime.

As W1 is a homogeneous kN-module, there exists an irreducible kN-module U such that [formula] with [formula], for each [formula]. Assume that U is the trivial kN-module. So, N acts trivially on W1. Since H permutes transitively the set of direct summands [formula] and since N is normal in H, we obtain that N acts trivially on V and N = 1, a contradiction. Therefore U is a non-trivial irreducible kN-module and, in particular, |aN1|,|bN1| > 1.

Write [formula] and [formula] with xi,yi∈Ui, for each [formula]. Since N stabilizes the direct summands [formula] of U, we obtain that [formula] and [formula]. In particular, for each [formula], we have that |xNi| divides |aN1| and |yNi| divides |bN1|. Since a1,b1  ≠  0, there exist [formula] with xi  ≠  0 and yj  ≠  0. Fix φi:Ui  →  U and φj:Uj  →  U two N-isomorphisms and write x = φi(xi) and y = φj(yj). In particular, x and y are non-zero elements of the non-trivial irreducible kN-module U. Furthermore, since φi and φj are N-isomorphisms, we obtain [formula] and [formula] and thus |xN| and |yN| are coprime. This contradicts the minimality of H and hence the theorem is proved.

We argue by contradiction and we assume that V is a non-trivial finite dimensional kH-module and that a and b are elements of V with V = 〈ah|h∈H〉  =  〈bh|h∈H〉 and with gcd (|aH|,|bH|) = 1. Now we argue by induction on dim kV. If V is irreducible, then the result follows from Theorem [\ref=thm2]. So, we assume that this is not the case. Let W be a minimal submodule of V and suppose that V / W is non-trivial. Clearly, (a + W)H and (b + W)H span V / W and hence, by induction, the lengths of the orbits of (a  +  W)H and (b  +  W)H are not coprime. As |(a + W)H| divides |aH| and |(b + W)H| divides |bH|, we have that |aH| and |bH| are not coprime.

Suppose now that V / W is the trivial kH-module. We claim that in this case V splits over W, that is, [formula] for some element v of V fixed by H. If the characteristic of V is zero, then V is semisimple and our claim is immediate. Suppose that V has characteristic p > 0. Replacing a by b if necessary, we may assume that [formula] and hence [formula] contains a Sylow p-subgroup P of H. We claim that [formula], that is, V splits over W. The module V corresponds to an element δ of [formula] (see [\cite=Brown] for the last isomorphism). On the other hand, V splits over W as a kP-module because [formula] and a∉W. Thus δ = 0 in H1(P,W*). However, from [\cite=Brown], we see that the restriction map :H1(G,W*)  →  H1(P,W*) is injective. So δ = 0 is H1(G,W*) and V splits over W. In particular, H fixes a vector [formula] and [formula].

Write a = λv + a' and b = μv + b' with λ,μ∈k, a'∈W and b'∈W. Clearly, a',b'  ≠  0 because aH and bH span V and V is not the trivial module. Similarly, W is not the trivial kH-module. Since H fixes v, we have [formula] and [formula] and hence |a'H|,|b'H| are relatively prime. This contradicts Theorem [\ref=thm2] applied to the irreducible module W and to the vectors a',b'.

Write [formula]. Since H is p-soluble and A contains a Sylow p-subgroup of H, the group H contains a p'-subgroup L with H = AL. (For example, H = AL for each Hall p'-subgroup L of H.) Now, let L be any p'-subgroup of H with H = AL and define ψL:V  →  V by setting

[formula]

We claim that [formula]. For v∈V and y∈L, we have

[formula]

So [formula]. Conversely, if [formula], then

[formula]

As |L| is coprime to p, we have v = ψL(v / |L|)∈ψL(V).

We now show that [formula]. As L  ⊆  H, we have [formula]. As H = AL, we have aH = aAL = aL. So, for every v∈aH, the image ψL(v) is a multiple of the sum of the elements of aL = aH. We deduce that ψL(v) is H-invariant, that is, H fixes ψL(v). Since aH spans V, we obtain that H fixes every element of [formula], that is, [formula].

Now we are ready to prove (a). Since aH = aL and aH spans V, the vector space V is generated by a as a kL-module. Thus, the map π:kL  →  V, given by [formula], defines a kL-homomorphism of kL onto V. Since p is coprime to |L|, by Maschke's theorem the kL-module V is isomorphic to a direct summand of the group-algebra kL. Therefore [formula].

We now prove (b). Let b∈V with gcd (|aH|,|bH|) = 1. Write [formula] and observe that H = AB. Since a is fixed by a Sylow p-subgroup of H, we see that p does not divide [formula] and so [formula] contains a Sylow p-subgroup of B. As H is p-soluble, we get that B is p-soluble and that B contains a p-complement L, say. So, [formula] and H = AB = AL. In particular, we are in the position to apply the first part of the proof to L. Thus [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

In this section we use Theorem [\ref=thm2] to prove Theorem [\ref=thm1]. We start by showing that the hypothesis "completely reducible" is essential.

We note that an example similar to Example [\ref=Exa1] is in [\cite=Isaacs3].

As V is completely reducible, we have [formula] for some direct summand W of V. Clearly, replacing V by W if necessary, we may assume that [formula], that is, H fixes no non-zero vector of V. There is also no loss in assuming that V is generated by a and b as a kH-module. Let V(a) and V(b) denote the kH-submodules generated by a and b, respectively. We claim that [formula], whence [formula] and [formula] as required.

Suppose not. Let S be a simple kH-submodule of [formula]. Since [formula], H does not act trivially on S. Since V is completely reducible, [formula] as kH-modules. Let π denote the projection of V onto S with kernel T. Clearly, |aH| is a multiple of |π(a)H| and similarly for b. Since S  ≤  V(a), π(a)  ≠  0 (and similarly for b). Thus, the lengths of the H-orbits in S of π(a) and π(b) are coprime contradicting Theorem [\ref=thm2].

We point out that from Theorem [\ref=thm1] we can easily deduce the following well-known result of Yuster (see [\cite=Yuster] or [\cite=Isaacs]).

Let H and A be finite groups with |H| relatively prime to |A| and with H acting as a group of automorphisms on A. If, for a,b∈A, the H-orbits aH and bH have relatively prime size, then H has an orbit of size |aH||bH|.

As |H| is relatively prime to |A|, from [\cite=HarTur] we see that we may assume that A is a direct product of elementary abelian groups. In particular, from Maschke's theorem, A is a completely reducible H-module, possibly of mixed characteristic. Now the result follows from Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3]

The main ingredient in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3] is Theorem [\ref=thm2] and the positive solution of Fisman and Arad [\cite=FZ] of Szep's conjecture.

Let G = AB be a finite group such that A and B are both subgroups of G with non-trivial centres. Then G is not a non-abelian simple group.

We start by considering some examples.

From Examples [\ref=exa2], [\ref=exa3] and [\ref=exa4] and Theorem [\ref=thm2], it suffices to show that if G is a primitive group of type HS, HC, SD or CD, then G has no non-trivial coprime subdegrees. We argue by contradiction and we assume that G is a primitive group on Ω of HS, HC, SD or CD type with two non-trivial coprime subdegrees.

We first consider the case that G is of HS or HC type. Let [formula] be the socle of G, with [formula] for some non-abelian simple group T, for each [formula]. From the description of the O'Nan-Scott types in [\cite=Pr], we see that [formula] is even (with [formula] if G is of HS type and with [formula] if G is of HC type). Furthermore, relabelling the indices [formula] if necessary, [formula] and [formula] are minimal normal regular subgroups of G, and Ω can be identified with [formula]. Namely, the action of N on Ω is permutation isomorphic to the action of [formula] on [formula] given by

[formula]

for [formula]. Under this identification, the stabilizer in [formula] of the element [formula] of [formula] is the set [formula] acting on [formula] by conjugation, that is, z(a,a) = a- 1za.

Let ω1,ω2 be elements of [formula] with m = |ωGω1| coprime to n = |ωGω2|. Since N is normal in G, we have that m' = |ωNω1| = |Nω:Nω,ω1| divides m and n' = |ωNω2| = |Nω:Nω,ω2| divides n. In particular, m' and n' are coprime. Identifying Ω with [formula] (as above), ω with [formula], Nω with [formula] (as above), ω1 with [formula] and ω2 with [formula], we get

[formula]

In particular, [formula] and [formula]. As m' is coprime to n', for each [formula], the indices [formula] and [formula] are coprime and hence [formula]. As ω1,ω2  ≠  1, there exist [formula] with xi  ≠  1 and yj  ≠  1. So [formula] is a coprime factorization and Theorem [\ref=szep] yields that T is not a non-abelian simple group, a contradiction.

It remains to consider the case that G is of SD or CD type. From the description of the O'Nan-Scott types in [\cite=Pr], we may write the socle N of G as

[formula]

with [formula] for some non-abelian simple group T, for each [formula] and [formula]: where r  ≥  2 and s  ≥  1 (with s = 1 if G is of SD type and with s  ≥  2 if G is of CD type). The set Ω can be identified with [formula] and, for the point ω∈Ω identified with [formula], the stabilizer Nω is [formula] where Di is the diagonal subgroup [formula] of [formula]. That is to say, the action of Nω on Ω is permutation isomorphic to the action of Ts on Ts(r - 1) by "diagonal" componentwise conjugation: the image of the point [formula] under the permutation [formula] is

[formula]

Let ω1,ω2 be elements of [formula] with m = |ωGω1| coprime to n = |ωGω2|. Since N is normal in G, we have that m' = |ωNω1| = |Nω:Nω,ω1| divides m and n' = |ωNω2| = |Nω:Nω,ω2| divides n. In particular, m' and n' are coprime. Identifying ω1 with [formula] and ω2 with [formula], we get

[formula]

In particular, [formula] and [formula].

As ω1,ω2  ≠  ω, there exist [formula] and [formula] with xi1,j1  ≠  1 and yi2,j2  ≠  1. Now, since [formula] and [formula] and since m' is relatively prime to n', we obtain [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=szep], T is a not non-abelian simple group, a contradiction.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=TW] and [\ref=thm4]

Before proving Theorem [\ref=TW] and [\ref=thm4] we need the following definition and lemmas.

If K is a direct product of isomorphic nonabelian simple groups, then μ(K)  ≤  2.

We have [formula] with [formula], for some nonabelian simple group T and for some [formula]. We argue by contradiction and we assume that μ(K)  ≥  3, that is, K has three proper subgroups A1, A2 and A3 with |K:A1|, |K:A2| and |K:A3| relatively prime. Write ai = |K:Ai| for i∈{1,2,3}. Replacing Ai with a maximal subgroup of K containing Ai if necessary, we may assume that Ai is maximal in K, for i∈{1,2,3}. In particular, (up to relabelling the simple direct summands of K) we have that either [formula] (for some maximal subgroup M1 of T1) or [formula] (for some isomorphism η:T1  →  T2). In the latter case we have that a1 = |T| is not relatively prime to a2 and to a3, a contradiction. Therefore, up to relabeling the indices, we may assume that [formula] with Mi a maximal subgroup of T1, for i∈{1,2,3}. This gives that the nonabelian simple group T1 admits three coprime factorizations T1 = M1M2 = M1M3 = M2M3 with |T1:M1|,|T1:M2| and |T1:M3| relatively prime. A simple inspection in Table [\ref=table] shows that this is impossible. The same conclusion can be obtained using [\cite=BadPr], where the authors determine all multiple factorizations of finite nonabelian simple groups T = MiMj, for i and j distinct elements of {1,2,3}. In particular, it is readily checked that in none of the multiple factorizations in [\cite=BadPr] are the indices |T:M1|, |T:M2| and |T:M3| pairwise coprime.

Let G be a transitive permutation group on Ω and let ω be in Ω. Suppose that N is normal in Gω and N fixes a unique point on Ω. Then the number of coprime subdegrees of G is at most μ(N).

Let [formula] be orbits of Gω on [formula] of pairwise coprime sizes and let ωi∈Oi, for [formula]. Now the orbits of N on Oi have all the same size, mi say, and mi divides |Oi|. Since N fixes only the point ω of Ω, we have that mi > 1. Therefore [formula] is a set of proper subgroups of N with pairwise coprime indices. Thus r  ≤  μ(N).

Let G be a primitive group of TW type. We use the notation introduced in the first paragraph of Example [\ref=exa4]: so [formula] is the twisted wreath product determined by H and [formula]. Recall that G acts primitively on N, with N acting on itself by right multiplication and with H acting on N by conjugation. In particular, H is the stabilizer of the point 1∈N. Let K be a minimal normal subgroup of H. From [\cite=DM], K is a direct product of nonabelian simple groups. Write [formula]. Hence [formula] with [formula], for each [formula]. Furthermore, L = NH(Ti) for some [formula]. Relabeling the Tj if necessary, we may assume that i = 1. From [\cite=DM], the group L is a core-free subgroup of H and hence [formula].

We claim that [formula] acting by conjugation on the simple group T1 induces all the inner automorphisms. If not, then [formula] because [formula] is a normal subgroup of L and T1 is nonabelian simple. Thus the homomorphism [formula] can be extended to a homomorphism [formula] of the group KL by setting (kl) = φ(l), for each l∈L and k∈K. As [formula], this contradicts the maximality condition of H in G given in [\cite=Bad], and the claim is proved. In particular, since K is a normal subgroup of H and since H acts transitively on the [formula] simple direct summands [formula], we obtain that [formula] induces by conjugation all the inner automorphisms of Ti, for each [formula]. This gives [formula] and so K fixes a unique point of N. Now the proof follows from Lemmas [\ref=id1] and [\ref=id2].

Before concluding this section we show that coprime subdegrees in primitive groups G of AS or PA type determine coprime subdegrees in transitive non-abelian simple groups T, and we give a strong relation between G and T. Let G be a primitive group of AS or PA type. We recall that from the description of the O'Nan-Scott types in [\cite=Pr] the group G is a subgroup of the wreath product [formula] endowed with its natural product action on [formula], with H an almost simple primitive group on Δ (we have [formula] and G = H if G is of AS type, and [formula] if G is of PA type). Furthermore, if T is the socle of H, then [formula] is the socle of G, where [formula] for each [formula]. Write Gi = NG(Ti) and denote by πi:Gi  →  H the natural projection. From [\cite=Pr], we see that replacing H by πi(Gi) if necessary, we may assume that πi(Gi) is surjective. In this case, we say that H is the component subgroup of G. In particular, if G is of AS type, the component subgroup of G is G itself.

(We recall that the definition of pseudo-maximal subgroup is in Definition [\ref=def].)

Let G be a primitive permutation group of AS or PA type acting on [formula] with component subgroup [formula] and let T be the socle of H. For δ∈Δ, the stabilizer Tδ is a pseudo-maximal subgroup of T. Furthermore, if G has k non-trivial coprime subdegrees, then T acting on Δ has at least k non-trivial coprime subdegrees.

As H is a primitive group of AS type on Δ, we have that Hδ is a maximal subgroup of the almost simple group H with [formula], for each δ∈Δ. Therefore [formula] is a pseudo-maximal subgroup of T and, in particular, NH(Tδ) = Hδ. Let Λ be the set of fixed points of Tδ on Δ and let δ1,δ2∈Λ. By transitivity, there exists h∈H with δh1  =  δ2, that is, Tδ = Tδ2 = Tδh1 = Thδ1 = Thδ. Therefore h∈NH(Tδ) = Hδ and Λ is the Hδ-orbit containing δ, that is, Λ  =  {δ} and Tδ fixes a unique point of Δ.

Let δ∈Δ and write [formula]. Let [formula] be the socle of G. Clearly, [formula] and, as Gα is a maximal subgroup of G and as N  ⊆  G, we obtain [formula].

Assume that G has k non-trivial coprime subdegrees [formula]. Now, there exist [formula] with ni = |βGαi|, for [formula]. Since N is a normal subgroup of G, we obtain that ni' = |βNαi| divides ni, and so [formula] are pairwise coprime. Furthermore

[formula]

for each [formula], and so [formula].

As ni' is coprime with nj', for each distinct i and j in [formula], the subdegrees |δTδi,x| and |δj,y'Tδ| of T acting on Δ are coprime, for each [formula]. Since for each [formula] we have βi  ≠  α, there exists [formula] with δi,ji  ≠  δ. Since Tδ fixes only the element δ of Δ, we have |δTδi,ji| > 1. Thus [formula] are k non-trivial coprime subdegrees of T acting on Δ.

Assume that Theorem [\ref=conj3] holds true. Let G be a primitive permutation group on Ω with three non-trivial coprime subdegrees. From Theorems [\ref=thm3] and [\ref=TW], G is of AS or PA type. Since Theorem [\ref=conj3] holds true, Proposition [\ref=propo] yields a contradiction.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=cor:3] and [\ref=cor:4]

As usual, we denote by [formula] the Fitting subgroup of the finite group G, that is, the largest normal nilpotent subgroup of G. The proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:3] and [\ref=cor:4] will follow from Lemma [\ref=apeman] and from the results in Section [\ref=sec4].

Let H be a finite permutation group. Let [formula] be H-orbits having pairwise coprime size, with |Oi| > 1 and with H faithful on Oi for each [formula]. Then t  ≤  2. Moreover, if [formula], then t  =  1

For each [formula], let ωi be an element of Oi and set Hi = Hωi. By hypothesis, Hi is a proper core-free subgroup of H. Let N be a minimal normal subgroup of H and set [formula]. As Hi is core-free in H, we have [formula]. Note that [formula] and hence |H:Hi| is a multiple of |N:Ni|. This shows that [formula] is a family of proper subgroups of N with |N:Ni| relatively prime to |N:Nj|, for each two distinct elements i and j in [formula]. Hence t  ≤  μ(N). If N is a p-group (for some prime p) then μ(N) = 1 and if N is non-abelian then μ(N)  ≤  2 by Lemma [\ref=id1].

Let G be a non-regular finite transitive permutation group on Ω and let α be in Ω. Set H = Gα. The result now follows from Lemma [\ref=apeman].

If t = 1, then there is nothing to prove. So we may assume that t  ≥  2. We claim that K / k is a separable extension (and so, as K / k is normal, a Galois extension). This is clear if k has characteristic 0. Suppose then that k has characteristic p > 0. Now, if for some [formula], the extension ki / k is separable, then K / k is separable (being the normal closure of a separable extension). Therefore we may assume that ki / k is inseparable, for each [formula]. This gives that p divides

[formula]

Coprime factorizations of non-abelian simple groups

Liebeck, Praeger and Saxl [\cite=LPS] [\cite=LPS2] completely classified the maximal factorizations of all finite almost simple groups. Tables 1-6 and Theorem D of [\cite=LPS] determine all the triples (G,A,B) where G is a nonabelian simple group, and A and B are maximal subgroups of G with G = AB.

Now, if A' and B' are subgroups of G with |G:A'| relatively prime to |G:B'|, then G = A'B'. In particular, A' and B' give rise to a coprime factorization of G. Moreover, if A (respectively B) is a maximal subgroup of G with A'  ⊆  A (respectively B'  ⊆  B), then G = AB is a maximal coprime factorization. Therefore, the list of all non-abelian simple groups admitting a coprime factorization can be easily obtained with some elementary arithmetic from [\cite=LPS]. Namely, for each triple (G,A,B) in Tables 1-6 and in Theorem D of [\cite=LPS], it suffices to check whether |G:A| is relatively prime to |G:B|. Table [\ref=table] in this paper gives all possible maximal coprime factorizations (G,A,B) and, in particular, the list of all non-abelian simple groups admitting a coprime factorization. The notation we use is standard and follows the notation in [\cite=LPS].
