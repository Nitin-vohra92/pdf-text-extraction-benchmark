Introduction

Let S be a topological space, and let A be a subset of S. Let Cl(A) denote the topological closure of A, and c(A) denote S  -  A, the complement of A. In 1922, Kuratowski [\cite=Kuratowski:1922] observed that if we start with an arbitrary A, and then apply the operations Cl,c in any order, any number of times, at most 14 distinct sets are generated. More precisely, the monoid of operations generated by Cl and c is of cardinality 14. We call this monoid the Kuratowski monoid.

However, as Hammer [\cite=Hammer:1960] observed, we do not really need all the axioms of a topological space; the same result holds in a more abstract setting. Let S be a set, and let k:2S  →  2S be a map such that for all A,B  ⊆  S, we have

A  ⊆  k(A); (the expanding property)

[formula]; (the inclusion-preserving property)

k(k(A))  =  k(A) (idempotence).

We call such a map a closure operator. We can now consider the monoid M generated by k and c under composition. The identity element of this monoid is denoted by ε. We denote composition by concatenation so that, for example, kck(A)  =  k(c(k(A))). Two elements f,g of M are equal if f(A)  =  g(A) for all A  ⊆  S.

Furthermore, there is a natural partial order on elements of M, given by [formula] for all A  ⊆  S. If f  ≤  g and g  ≤  f, we write [formula].

Hammer [\cite=Hammer:1960] showed that [formula]. (This follows immediately from our Theorem [\ref=kura] below.) It now follows that the monoid generated by {k,c} is

[formula]

and hence is of cardinality 14.

In this note we consider what happens for the case of two closure operators x and y.

For readers wanting to know practically everything about the Kuratowski theorem and its generalizations, the admirable survey of Gardner and Jackson [\cite=Gardner&Jackson:2008] is essential reading.

Two closure operators

As mentioned above, it is well-known that a single closure operator k satisfies the relation kckckck  =  kck. This result can be easily generalized to two closure operators, as follows [\cite=Charlier&Domaratzki&Harju&Shallit:2011]:

Let p,q be closure operators. Then [formula].

pcqcpcq  ⊆  pcq: We have L  ⊆  q(L) by the expanding property. Then cq(L)  ⊆  c(L). By the inclusion-preserving property we have pcq(L)  ⊆  pc(L). Since this identity holds for all L, it holds in particular for cpcq(L). Substituting, we get pcqcpcq(L)  ⊆  pccpcq(L). But pccpcq(L)  =  pcq(L) by the idempotence of p.

pcq  ⊆  pcqcpcq: We have L  ⊆  p(L) by the expanding property. Then, replacing L by cq(L), we get cq  ⊆  pcq. Applying c to both sides, we get cpcq  ⊆  ccq  =  q. Applying q to both sides, and using the inclusion-preserving property and idempotence, we get qcpcq  ⊆  qq  =  q. Applying c to both sides, we get cq  ⊆  cqcpcq. Finally, applying p to both sides and using the inclusion-preserving property, we get pcq  ⊆  pcqcpcq.

Theorem [\ref=kura] would also hold if c were replaced by any inclusion-reversing operation satisfying [formula].

Unlike the case of a single closure operator, our identity [formula] does not suffice to prove that the monoid generated by {c,p,q} is finite. Indeed, if p and q have no relations between them, then there is no obvious reason why any two distinct prefixes of [formula] would be related.

We construct a simple example where the monoid generated by {p,q} is infinite.

Consider [formula]. For A  ⊆  N, define

[formula]

Then it is easy to see that p and q are closure operators and [formula]. It follows that the monoid generated by {p,q} is infinite.

In order then for the monoid generated by {c,p,q} to be finite, we would need additional restrictions on the closure operators p and q. A natural restriction is to demand that p and q commute; that is, [formula].

It turns out that the case of two commuting closure operators is quite interesting. For example, one quickly finds additional identities, such as (just to list a few):

[formula]

In this paper, we will show two results: there are infinitely many identities of this kind, but nevertheless there are still examples where the monoid generated is infinite.

Infinitely many identities

The goal of this section is to prove the following result.

Let p,q be commuting closure operators. For all n  ≥  1 and [formula], we have [formula].

First note that pq is also a closure operator, and for each a∈{p,q,pq} the operator cac is an interior operator, i.e., it is idempotent and inclusion-preserving and satisfies the contracting property: A  ⊇  cac(A). For clarity let 1 denote the identity operator. It will suffice to prove [formula]. We have [formula] and hence for any set A,

[formula]

on the one hand, while

[formula]

on the other, proving [formula].

It may be of interest to note that the above reasoning can be carried out within the following first-order theory.

Let T2com be the theory with constants 1,p,q, binary operation ·   (written informally as juxtaposition), unary operation [formula], binary relation ≤  , and axioms that state that if [formula] is a model of T2com then:

(M,1,  ·  ) is a monoid.

(M,  ≤  ) is a poset.

x  ≤  y and u  ≤  v imply xu  ≤  yv for all x,y,u,v∈M.

[formula].

[formula].

x  ≤  y implies [formula].

[formula].

1  ≤  p = pp and 1  ≤  q = qq.

pq = qp.

The intended models of T2com are defined as follows. For a nonempty set S, let M(S) denote the set of all inclusion-preserving maps f:2S  →  2S. Let 1 denote the identity map 2S  →  2S. For f,g∈M(S) define

f  ≤  g iff f(A)  ⊆  g(A) for all A  ⊆  S.

[formula].

[formula]. (i.e., [formula] where [formula] is the complementation operator.)

Note that [formula]. Finally, choose two commuting closure operators p,q on S. Then [formula] is a model of T2com. (Of course not all models of T2com have this form.)

Given [formula] we call the word [formula] in [formula] c-balanced and associate with it the term [formula] in the language of T2com. Observe that if w1,w2 are c-balanced words in {p,q,c}, then [formula] implies [formula] whenever p,q are commuting closure operators p,q. Hence an alternative proof of Theorem [\ref=infin-eq] can be provided by proving

For any [formula], [formula].

Suppose w1,w2 are c-balanced words in [formula] with the property that [formula] whenever p,q are commuting closure operators on a set S. Does it follow that [formula]?

An example with infinite generated monoid

In this section improve Example 3 by constructing a pair of commuting closure operators p,q such that the monoid generated by {c,p,q} is infinite.

For n  ≥  1 define wn to be the word (cpcpcqcq)n. We will construct two commuting closure operators p,q on an infinite set S so that, interpreting c as complementation, there exists a subset A  ⊆  S with the property that [formula] is infinite.

Define [formula] and [formula]. We first define four pairs (pij,qij) of commuting closure operators (i,j∈{0,1}) on [formula] as follows: for [formula],

p00(A) = q00(A) = A.

[formula].

[formula], p10({2n - 1})  =  p10({2n}) = p10({2n - 1,2n})  =  {2n - 1,2n}, and [formula] if there does not exist n with A  ⊆  {2n - 1,2n}.

[formula], q10({2n})  =  q10({2n + 1}) = q10({2n,2n + 1})  =  {2n,2n + 1}, and [formula] if there does not exist n with A  ⊆  {2n,2n + 1}.

[formula] and [formula].

For all i,j∈{0,1}, pij,qij are closure operators on [formula] and pijqij = qijpij.

Put [formula]. Define p,q:2S  →  2S as follows: for A  ⊆  S,

[formula]

and similarly for q. Since [formula] for all A  ⊆  S, and since p00  ≤  p10,p01  ≤  p11 and similarly for the qij, we can deduce from the previous lemma that p,q are commuting closure operators on S. Observe that

[formula]

Hence [formula]. A similar calculation shows [formula]. Hence if [formula] then [formula] for all n  ≥  1, as desired. We have shown

The operator cpcpcqcq repeatedly applied to [formula] results in infinitely many distinct sets.

Conclusion

This paper leaves many questions unanswered. We end with two questions. Let Σ be the set of all formal equations w1  =  w2 where w1,w2 are words in [formula] with [formula] whenever p,q are commuting closure operators.

Is the set Σ decidable?

Can all the members of Σ be deduced from some finitely many of them? More precisely, is the monoid with generators c,p,q and set of relations Σ finitely presented?
