Linkage of finite Gorenstein dimension modules

Introduction

The theory of linkage of algebraic varieties introduced by Peskine and Szpiro [\cite=PS]. In [\cite=MS], Martsinkovsky and Strooker give its analogous definition for modules over non-commutative semiperfect Noetherian rings by using the composition of the two functors: transpose and syzygy. These functors and their compositions were studied by Auslander and Bridger in [\cite=AB]. The Gorenstein (or G-) dimension was introduced by Auslander [\cite=A1] and studied by Auslander and Bridger in [\cite=AB]. In this paper, we study the theory of linkage for class of modules which have finite Gorenstein dimensions. In particular, for a horizontally linked module M of finite and positive G-dimension, we study the role of its reduced grade,   (M), on the depth of its linked module λM.

In section 2, after preliminary notions and definitions, the associated prime ideals of [formula] is determined in terms of λM for any horizontally linked module M. As a consequence, we determine the reduced grade of a horizontally linked module of finite Gorenstein dimension. Also a characterization of a horizontally linked module to have G-dimension zero is given in Proposition [\ref=Gd]. In Theorem [\ref=t] , we give some equivalent conditions for a horizontally linked module M of finite and positive G-dimension such that    of M is equal to the reduced grade of λM.

In section 3, we study the reduced G-perfect modules (Definition [\ref=rgr]). For a reduced G-perfect module M of G-dimension n over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring R of dimension d, it is shown that   R(M) +   R(λM) = d +   R(  nR(M,R))(Theorem [\ref=d]). We also generalize this formula for modules of finite G-dimensions (not necessarily reduced G-perfect) with some conditions on depth of extension modules (Theorem [\ref=t1]). In Proposition [\ref=P1], we establish a characterization for stable reduced G-perfect module to be horizontally linked. More precisely, for a stable reduced G-perfect module M of G-dimension n, it is shown that M is horizontally linked if and only if   (M) +   (λM) =   R(  nR(M,R)).

In section 4, we generalize [\cite=Sc]. More precisely, for horizontally linked module M of finite G-dimension over Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d, it is shown that M satisfies the Serre condition (Sk) if and only if [formula] for all i, d - k < i < d.

Section 5 is dedicated to study the class of modules which are evenly linked by GK-Gorenstein ideals, where K is a semidualizing module. We first generalize [\cite=MS] and [\cite=MS]. For a semidualizing module K and K  Gorenstein ideals [formula], [formula] of grade n over local ring R, it is shown that the [formula] for all i, i > n, if there is an R-module M such that [formula] and [formula] (Definition [\ref=def1], Proposition [\ref=p4]). As a consequence, K  dimension is preserved under evenly linkage (Corollary [\ref=end]).

Throughout the paper, R is a commutative semiperfect Noetherian ring and all modules are finite (i.e. finitely generated) R-modules so that any such module has a projective cover.

Let [formula] be a finite projective presentation of M. The transpose of M,   M, is defined to be   f*, where ( - )*: =   R( - ,R), which satisfies in the exact sequence

[formula]

and is unique up to projective equivalence. Thus the minimal projective presentations of M represent isomorphic transposes of M. Here is a straightforward application of   M, which is quoted from [\cite=A]. For an R-module M the evaluation map eM:M  →  M*  * has kernel and cokernel isomorphic to   1R(  M,R) and   2R(  M,R), respectively. More precisely, one has the following exact sequence

[formula]

Let [formula] be an epimorphism such that P is a projective. The syzygy module of M, denoted by ΩM, is the kernel of α which is unique up to projective equivalence. Thus ΩM is uniquely determined, up to isomorphism, by a projective cover of M.

Recall that, over a Gorenstein local ring R, two ideals [formula] and [formula] are said to be linked by a Gorenstein ideal [formula] if [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Equivalently, the ideals [formula] and [formula] are linked by [formula] if and only if the ideals [formula] and [formula] of the ring [formula] are linked by the zero ideal of [formula]. To define linkage for modules, Martsinkovsky and Strooker introduced the operator λ  =  Ω  . In [\cite=MS], it is shown that ideals [formula] and [formula] are linked by zero ideal if and only if [formula] and [formula] are related to each other through the operator λ; more precisely, [formula] and [formula].

[\cite=MS] Two R-modules M and N are said to be horizontally linked if [formula] and [formula]. Also, M is called horizontally linked (to λM) if [formula].

Having defined the horizontal linkage, the general linkage for modules is defined as follows.

[\cite=MS] An R-module M is said to be linked to an R-module N, by an ideal [formula] of R, if [formula] and M and N are horizontally linked as [formula]-modules. In this situation we denote [formula].

Two modules M and N are called stably isomorphic and write [formula] if [formula] for some projective modules P and Q. A stable module is a module with no non-zero projective direct summands.

Let M be a stable R-module and let P1  →  P0  →  M  →  0 be a minimal projective presentation of M. Then P*0  →  P*1  →    M  →  0 is a minimal projective presentation of   M (see [\cite=AF]). We quote the following induced exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

Here is a characterization of horizontally linked modules in terms of kernel of the evaluation map eM [\cite=MS].

An R-module M is horizontally linked if and only if it is stable and   1R(  M,R) = 0.

The Gorenstein dimension was introduced by Auslander [\cite=A1], and developed by Auslander and Bridger in [\cite=AB].

An R-module M is said to belong to the G-class, G(R), whenever

the biduality map M  →  M*  * is an isomorphism;

iR(M,R) = 0 for all i > 0;

iR(M*,R) = 0 for all i > 0.

From the exact sequences ([\ref=m]), ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=1]) it is easy to see that M is in G(R) if and only if   iR(M,R) = 0 =   iR(  M,R) for all i > 0. The class G(R) is quite large, it contains all finitely generated projective modules. Note that if [formula] then M is in G(R) if and only if N is in G(R). In general, since [formula], it follows that M is in G(R) if and only if   M is in G(R) (see [\cite=AB]), and so if M is a stable R-module then M is in G(R) if and only if λM is in G(R) and M is horizontally linked (c.f. [\cite=MS]).

Trivially any R-module M has a G-resolution which is a right acyclic complex of modules in G(R) whose 0th homology module is M. The module M is said to have finite G-dimension, denoted by   R(M), if it has a G-resolution of finite length. Note that   R(M) is bounded above by the projective dimension,   R(M), of M and if   R(M) <   ∞   then the equality holds.

For module M of finite Gorenstein dimension,   R(M) can be expressed as follows.

[\cite=M1] For an R-module M of finite G-dimension, the following statements hold true.

[formula],

If R is local, then   R(M) =   R -   R(M).

Note that if R is a Gorenstein local ring then every R-module has finite Gorenstein dimension (see [\cite=AB]). Thus Theorem [\ref=Gor] implies that over Gorenstein local ring R, G(R) is precisely the class of all maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules.

An R-module M is called a syzygy module if it is embedded in a projective R-module. Let i be a positive integer, the module M is said to be an ith syzygy of an R-module N (abbreviated as an ith syzygy) if there exists an exact sequence

[formula]

with the [formula] are projective. By convention, every module is a 0th syzygy. In a pioneer work, Hyman Bass [\cite=B] defined reduced grade of a module to describe modules which are an ith syzygies for some i. We recall the definition of reduced grade from [\cite=B].

The reduced grade of an R-module M is defined to be

[formula]

Note that   R(M) =   R(M) if   R(M) > 0. Moreover, if   R(M) = 0 then   (M) =   ∞  . For modules of finite and positive G-dimension, one has   (M)  ≤    R(M) and so it is finite.

Bass shows that, "for a given positive integer r, a module H over a Gorenstein ring R is an rth syzygy if and only if H is reflexive and   R(H*)  ≥  r - 1" [\cite=B].

We are going to discuss about the reduced grade of a module which is closely related to the property denoted by [formula].

[\cite=M1] An R-module M is said to satisfy the property [formula] if [formula] min[formula], for all [formula].

Note that if R is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring and M is horizontally linked module, then M satisfies [formula] if and only if M satisfies the Serre condition (Sk). Here is a characterization for a module M to satisfy [formula] (see [\cite=AB] or [\cite=M1]).

Let k be a positive integer. Consider the following statements.

(  M) > k;

M is a kth syzygy;

for each [formula], every [formula]-regular sequence of length at most k is also [formula]-regular sequence;

M satisfies [formula]. Then we have the following

(i)⇒  (ii)⇒  (iii)⇒  (iv);

If   R(M)  <    ∞  , then (iv) implies (i);

If   R(M)  <    ∞  , then all the statements (i)-(iv) are equivalent to

[formula]

Note that when   R(M) <   ∞  , the above theorem of Auslander and Bridger gives a complete description of the module M to be a kth syzygy, over an arbitrary ring. As any finite module over a Gorenstein ring has finite G-dimension, this theorem may be considered as generalization of the Bass result (see acknowledgement).

As an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=AS], we have the following.

Let M be a stable R-module of finite G-dimension. The following statements hold true.

For a positive integer k, M satisfies [formula] if and only if   (λM)  ≥  k and M is horizontally linked.

Assume that M is a horizontally linked. Then [formula] if and only if   (λM) <   ∞  .

(i). By Theorem [\ref=AS], M satisfies [formula] if and only if   iR(  M,R) = 0 for all i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. By Theorem [\ref=MS], it is equivalent to have M horizontally linked and   (λM)  ≥  k by using ([\ref=1]).

(ii). Let [formula]. There is [formula], such that [formula]. Assume, contrarily, that   (λM) =   ∞   so that M satisfies [formula] for each integer k. Choose an integer k with [formula]. We get [formula] which yields [formula]. The other side is obvious.

For k > 0, the composed functor Tk: =   Ωk - 1 is introduced by Auslander and Bridger in [\cite=AB], and recently used by Iyama [\cite=I] to define a duality between some full subcategories (e.g. Example [\ref=exa]). As we will use the composed functor Tk frequently, we note some of its properties in the following.

(See [\cite=MS] and ([\ref=m]).) For a stable R-module N, there is an exact sequence

[formula]

Note that, as the transpose of every R-module is either stable or zero,   TkM is stably isomorphic to Ωk - 1M for every R-module M and all k  >  0. As [formula], we obtain

[formula]

by replacing N by TkM in the above exact sequence .

linkage and the reduced grade of modules

We start this section by expressing the associated primes of the [formula] for a horizontally linked module M of finite and positive G-dimension in terms of λM.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module of finite and positive G-dimension. Set n =   (M). Then

We first give some general comments. Let [formula] with [formula] so that [formula]. As M is a syzygy, we get [formula]. Moreover assume that [formula]. Consider the exact sequence ([\ref=e]) for [formula] and i > 0,

[formula]

Note that [formula] is stably isomorphic to [formula].

As [formula], [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i < n. Thus [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i < n, by ([\ref=d1]). Therefore [formula] is stably isomorphic to [formula] for 1  ≤  i < n. Now, inductively, we get [formula].

Let [formula] so that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, by Theorem [\ref=Gor], [formula]. If [formula] then [formula] is a free [formula]-module by ([\ref=1]) and, as [formula], [formula] is free and so it is equal to zero. Therefore [formula] is free [formula]-module which is a contradiction. Thus [formula].

Since [formula] it follows [formula] and so [formula]. As [formula] and [formula], we conclude that [formula].

Conversely, let [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, as mentioned above, we have [formula] and also [formula]. Hence, it is easy to see that [formula]. Consider the exact sequence ([\ref=d1]) for i = n. As [formula] is a syzygy as [formula]-module and [formula] we find that [formula] and so [formula].

We can express the reduced grade of a horizontally linked module M with finite G-dimension in terms of λM.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module of finite G-dimension. Then

[formula]

We may assume that   R(M) > 0. Set n =   (M). Let [formula] with [formula] so that [formula]. As M is a syzygy, we get [formula]. Therefore, we have [formula]. As λM is a first syzygy,   1R(  λM,R) = 0 (cf. [\cite=BH]). Note that [formula] and so [formula] for 2  ≤  i  ≤  n, and so, by Theorem [\ref=AS], we have [formula], and so [formula]

On the other hand, by the Lemma [\ref=l3], if [formula] then [formula] and [formula] and so the assertion holds.

For a ring R, set [formula]. We have the following characterization of horizontally linked module of G-dimension zero.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module of finite G-dimension. Then   R(M) = 0 if and only if [formula] for all [formula].

Set n =   R(M). Let [formula] for all [formula]. Assume contrary, n > 0. By Proposition [\ref=p], there exists [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore we have [formula] and so, by Theorem [\ref=Gor], [formula] which is a contradiction. Therefore   R(M) = 0.

Let   R(M) = 0. Assume contrarily that [formula] for some [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Now [\cite=C] implies that [formula]. Thus we obtain [formula]. As λM is a syzygy, [formula] which is a contradiction.

Recall that a module M is said to be horizontally self-linked if [formula] (see [\cite=MS]).

Let M be a horizontally self-linked R-module of finite G-dimension. Then   R(M) = 0 if and only if [formula] for all [formula].

As [formula], the claim is obvious by Proposition [\ref=Gd].

For a subset X of   R, we say that M is of G-dimension zero on X, if [formula] for all [formula] in X.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module of finite and positive G-dimension. Set tM  =    (M) +   (λM), then M is of G-dimension zero on XtM - 1(R).

We prove the claim by induction on n =   (M). Note that, by Corollary [\ref=A], we have [formula] for all [formula]. If n = 1 and [formula], then it follows that [formula].

Assume that n > 1. It is obvious that   (M) =   (ΩM) + 1. Applying induction hypothesis on ΩM, implies that ΩM is of G-dimension zero on XtΩM - 1(R). Now consider the exact sequence ([\ref=e]). Note that λ2TiM is stably isomorphic to ΩTi + 1M. Since   1R(M,R) = 0, it follows that [formula] and so

[formula]

Also we have [formula]. As M is horizontally linked, it is a first syzygy and so ΩM is a second syzygy. Therefore, by Theorem [\ref=AS],   2R(  ΩM,R) = 0 and hence   (λM) =   (λ(ΩM)) - 1 and so tΩM = tM. Now consider the exact sequence 0  →  ΩM  →  P  →  M  →  0, where P is a projective module. Since   1R(M,R) = 0, it follows that M is of G-dimension zero on XtM - 1(R).

In Theorem [\ref=AS], Auslander and Bridger give the connection of the reduced grade of   M with the property M being a syzygy. The following result shows the connection of the reduced grade of M with the property that λM being a syzygy.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module of finite G-dimension. Let k be a positive integer. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(M)  ≥  k.

λM is a kth syzygy.

Every [formula]-regular sequence of length at most k is also [formula]-regular sequence for each [formula].

λM satisfies [formula].

Since λM is a first syzygy, it is torsionless and so   1R(  λM,R) = 0 by ([\ref=m]). Since M is horizontally linked, [formula], and so   iR(  λM,R) = 0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤    (M), that is   (  λM) >   (M). Replacing M by λM in Theorem [\ref=AS], implies that (i)⇒  (ii)⇒  (iii)⇒  (iv).

(iv)⇒  (i) If   R(M) = 0 then we have nothing to prove. Assume that   R(M) > 0. Set n =   (M) and suppose that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l3], we have [formula]. Also we have [formula]. As λM satisfies [formula], it follows [formula] and so [formula] and so   (M)  ≥  k.

Let [formula] be a local ring. Recall from [\cite=EGS] that   (M) denotes the largest n for which M can be an nth syzygy in a minimal free resolution of an R-module N. Note that   (M) =   ∞  , whenever   R(M) = 0. If M is a horizontally linked of finite and positive G-dimension then Theorem [\ref=AS] implies that   (M) =   (λM). In this case, it is obvious that   R(M)  ≥    (λM). The following theorem shows that under certain condition the equality holds. In general, it is well-known that [formula], for [formula]. In the following result, it is shown that if    of M is small enough then it is equal to the reduced garde of λM. The authors are grateful to J. R. Strooker and A.-M. Simon for quoting a flaw in the pervious version of this Theorem.

For an R-module M, set

[formula]

Let [formula] be a local ring and let M be an R-module of finite and positive G-dimension. If M is horizontally linked then the following conditions are equivalent.

R(M) =   (M) =   (λM);

[formula];

[formula], for each [formula].

Set t =   (λM). As   R(M) > 0, by Corollary [\ref=A], t <   R. In the following we use the exact sequence ([\ref=e]):

[formula]

As   iR(λM,R) = 0 for all i, 1  ≤  i < t, [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i < t, and so

[formula]

(i)⇒  (ii) As M is horizontally linked and t =   R(M) <   R, it is easy to see that   R(Tt(λM)) = 0 by the ([\ref=!]). From the exact sequence ([\ref=!!]), as   R(λ2Tt(λM)) > 0, we find that   R(  tR(λM,R)) = 0 and so [formula].

(ii)⇒  (i) By the exact sequence ([\ref=!!]), it is obvious that   R(Tt(λM)) = 0. As M is horizontally linked and t <   R, by ([\ref=!]),   R(M) = t.

(i)⇒  (iii) By Corollary [\ref=A], M satisfies [formula]. Hence if [formula] then [formula].

(iii)⇒  (i) As   R(M) > 0,   R(M)  ≥  t, by Corollary [\ref=A]. Let [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and [formula]. By the exact sequence ([\ref=!!]), we have [formula]. If [formula] then [formula], which is a contradiction, because [formula]. Hence [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=A], M satisfies [formula] and so it is easy to see that [formula]. Now by the exact sequence ([\ref=!!]), we have [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i < t, and so [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. As [formula], [formula] and so   R(M)  ≤  t. Therefore,   R(M) =   (λM).

The following lemma will be useful for the rest of the paper.

Let M and N be R-modules and let n be a positive integer with   (M)  ≥  n. Then

[formula]

[formula]

(i) Let [formula] be a part of a projective resolution of M. Set Fi = P*n - i for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n, so that one has a right acyclic projective complex [formula], where [formula]. Now, the tensor evaluation morphism [formula] implies

[formula]

for all i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1.

On the other hand, the fact that [formula] for all i > 0, and the exact sequence ([\ref=e]) in the Remark [\ref=R], imply [formula]. Therefore [formula] for i > n.

(ii) By the homomorphism evaluation morphism, one has [formula], and so

[formula]

for all i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. If i > n then, just similar the part (i), we have [formula]

Let M and N be R-modules. Then the following statements hold true.

If M is horizontally linked module, then [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i <  inf {  (M),  (λM)}. In particular, if   R(M) = 0 then [formula] for all i > 0.

If M and N are horizontally self-linked modules, then [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i < inf {  (M),  (N)}.

(i) Let m be a positive integer such that 1 < m  ≤   inf {  (M),  (λM)}. If 1  ≤  i < m then by part (i) of Lemma [\ref=p2], one has [formula]. Also, by part (ii) of Lemma [\ref=p2], one has [formula] for 1  ≤  i < m. Since   (M)  ≥  m it is easy to see that   (TmM)  ≥  m and [formula] by ([\ref=e]). Now, by Theorem [\ref=MS] and the fact that M is horizontally linked, it follows that [formula]. If   (TmM) <   ∞  , then it follows that   (TmM) =   (λM) + m which gives [formula]. The exact sequences

[formula]

where Pi is a projective module for 0  ≤  i < m, imply that [formula] for 1  ≤  i < m.

(ii) Let m be a positive integer such that 1 < m  ≤   inf {  (M),  (N)}. If 1  ≤  i < m, then one observes, similar the part (i), that [formula] for 1  ≤  i < m. Since M is horizontally self-linked module and m  ≤    (M) it follows from ([\ref=e]) that [formula] and [formula]. Similarly we have [formula] and [formula]. Therefore [formula] for 1  ≤  i < m and the result follows.

reduced G-perfect modules

Let M be an R-module of positive G-dimension. The following inequalities are well-known

[formula]

In the literature, M is called perfect (resp. G-perfect) if   R(M) =   R(M) (resp.   R(M) =   R(M)). In this section we are interested in the case where   (M) =   R(M). So we bring the following definition.

Let M be an R-module of finite G-dimension, we say that M is reduced G-perfect if its G-dimension is equal to its reduced grade, i.e.   (M) =   R(M).

Note that every reduced G-perfect module has a finite and positive G-dimension. It is obvious that [formula] is the only non-zero module among all   iR(M,R) for i > 0. Therefore, every reduced G-perfect module is an Eilenberg-MacLane module of finite G-dimension as mentioned in [\cite=Hor]. These modules are studied in [\cite=N1] and [\cite=N2]. In the following result, the depth of any reduced G-perfect module is determined.

Let [formula] be a local Cohen-Macaulay ring of dimension d. If M is reduced G-perfect of G-dimension n, then   R(M) +   R(λM) = d +   R(  nR(M,R)).

We will use the exact sequence ([\ref=e]) in the Remark [\ref=R]. Note that [formula] for all i > 0. As M is a reduced G-perfect module, it follows that [formula].

We prove the claim by induction on t =   R(  nR(M,R)). Assume that t = 0 so that [formula] and then   R(TnM) = 0 by ([\ref=e]). As [formula], we have   R(λM) = n. Now the equality   R(M) +   R(λM) = d, follows by the Auslander-Bridger formula.

Let t > 0. By [\cite=AB],   R(  nR(M,R))  ≥  n. Note that

[formula]

over the Cohen-Macaulay local ring R. Therefore we have

[formula]

Now let [formula], where [formula]. Taking [formula] and [formula], we have [formula] by [\cite=AB]. Apply the functor   R(M, - ) on the exact sequence [formula]. As x is a nonzero-divisor on   nR(M,R), we obtain the following exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] for 1  ≤  i < n. From ([\ref=31]), ([\ref=32]) and the standard isomorphisms we get [formula] and [formula]. Now it is easy to see that [formula]. As a result, [formula] is also a reduced G-perfect [formula]-module of G-dimension n. As [formula],

[formula]

by induction hypothesis.

Now let P1  →  P0  →  M  →  0 be the minimal projective presentation of M and consider the exact sequence 0  →  M*  →  P*0  →  λM  →  0. As λM is a syzygy module and x is a non-zero-divisor on R, x is also a non-zero-divisor on λM. Thus there is a commutative diagram with exact rows

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Now, ([\ref=33]) implies

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=d] enables us to prove it for a more general setting.

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d and let M be an R-module of finite Gorenstein dimension n. If

[formula]

then   R(M) +   R(λM) = d +   R(  nR(M,R)).

First note that if n = 0 then   R(M*) =   R(λM) = 0 and so the assertion is obvious. We proceed by induction on n. If n = 1 then   R(M) =   (M) that is M is reduced G-perfect. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=d], the assertion holds. Suppose that n > 1. We have   R(ΩM) = n - 1 and [formula] for each i > 1. By induction hypothesis we have

[formula]

Therefore   R(λΩM) + 1 = n +   (  nR(M,R)) <   R(  1R(M,R)). Now consider the exact sequence [formula]. As [formula], it easy to see that   R(λΩM) =   R(  M) =   R(λM) - 1. Finally, by using the trivial formula   R(ΩM) =   R(M) + 1 and ([\ref=3-3]), we have   R(M) +   R(λM) = d +   R(  nR(M,R)).

The following result characterizes a reduced G-perfect module to be horizontally linked.

Let M be a reduced G-perfect R-module of G-dimension n, then the following statements hold true.

[formula] for all i > 0.

Assume that M is stable R-module. Then M is horizontally linked if and only if   (M) +   (λM) =   R(  nR(M,R)).

(i) As M is reduced G-perfect,   (M) =   R(M) = n. Consider the exact sequence ([\ref=e]) for i = n

[formula]

As   R(M) = n, it follows that   R(ΩnM) = 0 and so   R(Tn + 1M) = 0 by [\cite=AB]. Therefore   R(ΩTn + 1M) = 0. As [formula], we have   R(λ2TnM) = 0. Now from the exact sequence ([\ref=n]) we obtain the isomorphisms [formula] for all i > 0. Note that   (M) = n implies [formula] and so [formula] for all i > 0. The claim follows.

(ii) Assume that M is stable R-module. By Theorem [\ref=MS] and Theorem [\ref=AS], M is horizontally linked module if and only if   R(  nR(M,R))  ≥  n + 1. Now by the part (i), it is obvious that M is horizontally linked module if and only if   (M) +   (λM) =   R(  nR(M,R)).

The following Corollary shows how reduced G-perfect property is preserved under horizontally linkage.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module. Let n and t be two integers, then the following statements are equivalent.

M is reduced G-perfect of G-dimension n and   nR(M,R) is G-perfect of G-dimension n + t.

λM is reduced G-perfect of G-dimension t and   tR(λM,R) is G-perfect of G-dimension n + t.

(i)⇒  (ii). As we have seen in the proof of Proposition [\ref=P1],   R(λ2TnM) = 0 and also [formula]. Therefore, from the exact sequence ([\ref=n]), we conclude that   R(λM) <   ∞   if and only if   R(  nR(M,R)) <   ∞  . Also, from the part (i) of Proposition [\ref=P1], if these dimensions are finite then we have   R(λM) + n =   R(  nR(M,R)). Hence, by part (ii) of Proposition [\ref=P1], it is obvious that λM is reduced G-perfect of G-dimension t if and only if   nR(M,R) is G-perfect of G-dimension n + t.

As M is horizontally linked, [formula], and M is reduced G-perfect of G-dimension n, by replacing M by λM in the above argument one has   tR(λM,R) is G-perfect of G-dimension n + t.

(ii)⇒  (i). It can be proved by the same argument.

Let M be a horizontally linked R-module of G-dimension n with 0 < n <   ∞  . Then M is reduced G-perfect if and only if λM satisfies [formula].

As M has a positive and finite Gorenstein dimension n,   (M)  ≤    R(M). On the other hand, by Proposition [\ref=c], λM satisfies [formula] if and only if   (M)  ≥  n. Therefore the assertion is obvious.

Let M be a perfect R-module of projective dimension n and let N be an R-module. It is well-known that [formula] for all i, 0  ≤  i < n.

To find an answer for the case i > n, we consider M to be reduced G-perfect and put some conditions on N. More precisely

Let M be a reduced G-perfect R-module of G-dimension n and let N be an R-module of finite flat or injective dimension. Then we have the following isomorphisms.

[formula]

[formula]

As   R(M) = n, one has   R(ΩnM) = 0 and so   R(Tn + 1M) = 0. Now, by [\cite=Y], we have   iR(Tn + 1M,N) = 0 =   Ri(Tn + 1M,N) for all i > 0. Therefore, from the exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

of [\cite=AB], we get [formula] and [formula], which prove the claims (i) and (ii) for i = 0. For i > 0, we consider the exact sequence 0  →    nR(M,R)  →  TnM  →  λ2TnM  →  0. Note that [formula], and so   R(λ2TnM) = 0. Therefore [formula] and also [formula] for all i > 0. Now the assertion is obvious by Lemma [\ref=p2].

linkage of modules and local cohomology

Let [formula] and [formula] be ideals in a Gorenstein local ring R which are linked by a Gorenstein ideal [formula]. In [\cite=Sc], Schenzel proves that the Serre condition (Sr) for [formula] is equivalent to the vanishing of the local cohomology groups [formula] for all i, [formula]. Here we extend this result for any horizontally linked module of finite G-dimension over a more general ground ring, i.e. over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. First we bring the following lemma which is clear if the ground ring is Gorenstein by using the Local Duality Theorem.

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d and let M be an R-module of dimension d which is not maximal Cohen-Macaulay. If   R(λM) <   ∞   then

[formula]

We may assume that R is complete with canonical module ωR. Set [formula] and n =   (M). Note that n  ≤  d. Otherwise, n > d implies [formula] by ([\ref=e]) and so   R(  M) = 0 by Theorem [\ref=Gor] (ii). Therefore   R(M) = 0 which is a contradiction. Note that, by Lemma [\ref=p2] (i), we have

[formula]

Since [formula], it follows   R(TnM) <   ∞  . By [\cite=F], we have   Ri(TnM,ωR) = 0 for all i > 0. Now, the Local Duality Theorem and ([\ref=41]) imply that t  ≤  d - n. If t = d - 1 then we have nothing to prove. Assume that t < d - 1. Let [formula] be a minimal projective resolution of M. We have the commutative diagram

[formula]

with exact rows, where [formula]. Therefore [formula]. On the other hand, by the Local Duality Theorem, we have   iR(M,ωR) = 0 for all i, 1  ≤  i < d - t, from which we obtain the exact sequence [formula]. Now it is straightforward to see that   (f), and so [formula] satisfies [formula].

Since   R(  M) <   ∞  , it follows, by [\cite=Y] and [\cite=F], that   M satisfies [formula]. As [formula],   iR(M,R) = 0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - t - 1 by Theorem [\ref=AS]. Hence   (M) = d - t.

Now we are able to generalize [\cite=Sc] for modules of finite Gorenstein dimension.

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d, and let M be a horizontally linked R-module of finite G-dimension. Let k be a non-negative integer. Then M satisfies the Serre condition (Sk) if and only if [formula] for all i, d - k + 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

As [formula], it is easy to see that M satisfies (Sk) if and only if M satisfies the condition [formula] which is also equivalent to say   (λM)  ≥  k, by Corollary [\ref=A]. Now the claim follows from the proof of Lemma [\ref=41], by replacing M by λM.

(Compare with [\cite=DGHS]) Let [formula] be a local ring with   R > 0 and let M be a stable R-module. Assume that M is of G-dimension zero on the punctured spectrum of R. Then the following statements hold true.

M is horizontally linked if and only if [formula].

If M is horizontally linked module of finite and positive G-dimension, then

[formula].

(i) As M is locally G-dimension zero on the punctured spectrum and [formula] for all [formula], it follows that   M is also of locally G-dimension zero on the punctured spectrum and so [formula]. Consider the exact sequence ([\ref=e1]), 0  →    1R(  M,R)  →  M  →  λ2M  →  0. As λ2M is a syzygy module and [formula], we get [formula]. Now the assertion is obvious by Theorem [\ref=MS].

(ii) Set   (M) = t. As t > 0 and M is of G-dimension zero on the punctured spectrum, it follows that [formula]. Now Lemma [\ref=l3] implies that   R(λM) =   (M).

In [\cite=DGHS], it is shown that [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i <   R whenever R is Cohen-Macaulay with canonical module ωR,   Ri(M,ωR) = 0 for all i > 0 and   iR(M,R) is of finite length for all i, 1  ≤  i <   R. In the following, we conclude the same result without assuming that R is Cohen-Macaulay and without condition on torsion modules of the canonical module.

Let R be a local ring with [formula] and let M be an R-module. Assume that n is an integer such that 1 < n  ≤    R and that   iR(M,R) is of finite length for all i, 1  ≤  i < n. Then [formula] for all i, 1  ≤  i < n.

Consider the exact sequence ([\ref=e]), 0  →    iR(M,R)  →  TiM  →  λ2TiM  →  0. Note that [formula]. Since   iR(M,R) is of finite length for 1  ≤  i < n, applying the functor [formula] on this exact sequence, we get

[formula]

and also

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Now by using ([\ref=43]), ([\ref=44]) and ([\ref=42]) we obtain the result.

Semidualizing modules and evenly linked modules

Let [formula] be a Gorenstein local ring, [formula] and [formula] Gorenstein ideals. Let M1,M and M2 be R-modules such that M1 is linked to M by [formula] and M is linked to M2 by [formula]. In [\cite=MS], Martsinkovsky and Strooker prove that   R(M1) =   R(M2) and also

[formula]

In this section we prove ([\ref=51]), without assuming R is Gorenstein, but we assume some conditions on the modules M1, M, M2 and on ideals c1, c2. We also show that the condition [formula](see Definition [\ref=S]) is preserved under evenly linkage.

Throughout this sectsion R is a local ring, K and M are R-modules. Denote [formula]. The module M is called K-reflexive if the canonical map [formula] is bijective.

The Gorenstein dimension was extended to K  dimension by Foxby in [\cite=F] and by Golod in [\cite=G].

The module M is said to have K  dimension zero if

M is K-reflexive;

iR(M,K) = 0, for all i > 0;

[formula], for all i > 0.

A K  resolution of a finite R-module M is a right acyclic complex of modules of K  dimensions zero whose 0th homology module is M. The module M is said to have finite K  dimension, denoted by K  R(M), if it has a K  resolution of finite length. Recall definition of semidualizing modules and some of its properties.

An R-module K is called a semidualizing module (suitable), if

the homothety morphism R  →    R(K,K) is an isomorphism;

iR(K,K) = 0 for all i > 0.

Semidualizing modules are studied in [\cite=F] and [\cite=G]. It is obvious that R itself is a semidualizing R-module. Also if R is Cohen-Macaulay then its canonical module (if exists) is a semidualizing module.

Recall that the K  dimension of a module M can be expressed as follows, if it is finite.

([\cite=G]) Let K be a semidualizing R-module. For an R-module M of finite K  dimension the following statements hold true.

[formula],

K  R(M) =   R -   R(M).

We recall the following definitions from [\cite=G].

An R-module M is called K  perfect if   R(M) = K  R(M). An ideal I is called K  perfect if R / I is K  perfect as R-module. An R-module M is called K  Gorenstein if M is K  perfect and   nR(M,K) is cyclic, where n = K  R(M). An ideal I is called K  Gorenstein if R / I is K  Gorenstein as R-module.

Note that if K is a semidualizing R-module and I is a K  Gorenstein ideal of K  dimension n, then [formula](see [\cite=G]).

We frequently use the following results of Golod.

[\cite=G] Let I be an ideal of R. Assume that K is an R-module and that n is a fixed integer. If   jR(R / I,K) = 0 for all j  ≠  n then there is an isomorphism of functors [formula] on the category of R / I-modules for all [formula].

[\cite=G]. Let I be a K  perfect ideal, and let K be a semidualizing R-module. Set C = [formula]. Then the following statements hold true.

C is a semidualizing R / I-module.

If M is a R / I-module then K  R(M) <   ∞   if and only if C  R / I(M) <   ∞  , and if these dimensions are finite then K  R(M) =   (I) + C  R / I(M).

Let I be a perfect ideal (i.e. R / I is perfect as an R-module). Assume that   (I) = n and that   nR(R / I,R) is cyclic. Let M be a perfect R-module of grade n such that I  ⊆    R(M). In [\cite=MS], Martsinkovsky and Strooker prove that if M is stable as an R / I-module then M is linked by I and also λR / IM is perfect of grade n. In the following, we give a generalization of this Theorem.

Let K be a semidualizing R-module. Assume that I is a K  Gorenstein ideal of grade n and that M is a K  perfect R-module of grade n such that I  ⊆    R(M). Then λR / IM is a K  perfect R-module of grade n. Moreover, if M is stable as R / I-module then it is horizontally linked as R / I-module.

Since I is a K  Gorenstein ideal, [formula] (see [\cite=G]). Now by Theorem [\ref=G2](ii),   R / I(M) = 0 so that   R / I(  R / IM) = 0 (see [\cite=AB]), and hence   R / I(λR / IM) = 0. Again by applying Theorem [\ref=G2](ii) for λM, we conclude that K  R(λR / IM) = n. As I  ⊆    R(λR / IM), we have n  ≤    R(λR / IM)  ≤  K  R(λR / IM). Hence λR / IM is a K  perfect R-module of grade n. Now, if M is stable as R / I-module then it is horizontally linked by [\cite=MS].

Recall that two R-modules M and N are said to be in the same even linkage class, or evenly linked, if there is a chain of even length of linked modules that starts with M and ends with N.

We first bring the following lemma which is a generalization of [\cite=MS].

Assume that I is an ideal of R and that M is horizontally linked as R / I-module. Assume that K is a semidualizing R-module and that I is K  Gorenstein. Then   R(M) =   (I).

Set n =   (I). As I  ⊆    R(M),   R(M)  ≥  n. On the other hand, as I is K  Gorenstein, [formula], by the Lemma [\ref=G1]. Since M is horizontally linked R / I-module, λR / IM is stable by [\cite=MS]. Therefore [formula] by ([\ref=2]). Since K is a semidualizing R-module it follows that every R-regular sequence is also K-regular sequence (see [\cite=G]). Therefore, by [\cite=BH], we have

[formula]

The following Proposition is a generalization of [\cite=MS].

Let K be a semidualizing R-module, [formula] and [formula] two K  Gorenstein ideals. Assume that M1,M, and M2 are R-modules such that [formula] and [formula]. Denote the common value of [formula] and [formula] by n (see Lemma [\ref=l2]). Then [formula] for all i, i > n.

By Lemma [\ref=G1], it is enough to show that [formula] for all i > 0. Note that, by ([\ref=m]), one has

[formula]

where [formula] is the canonical evaluation map. Note that [formula] (c.f. [\cite=BH]). Let [formula] be an R-regular sequence of length n. As K is a semidualizing R-module, [formula] is also a K-regular sequences. Set [formula] and [formula]. By the standard isomorphisms and the fact that [formula] is a K  Gorenstein, [formula]. Therefore, for each [formula]-module N,

[formula]

Hence, we have the commutative diagram

[formula]

with exact rows, where [formula] and [formula]. Thus, we have [formula]. Similarly, [formula].

Now suppose that i > 1. As [formula], it follows, from ([\ref=2]) and Lemma [\ref=G1], that [formula]. Therefore, one has

[formula]

where the last isomorphism is obtained by Lemma [\ref=G1]. By the same argument, one has [formula].

Let [formula] be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with canonical module ωR. Assume that [formula] and [formula] are Gorenstein ideals and that M1,M, and M2 are R-modules such that [formula] and [formula]. Set n =   R(M1) =   R(M2). Then [formula], for all i, i < n.

By Proposition [\ref=p4] and the Local Duality Theorem the assertion is obvious.

We end the paper by another Corollary which in its first part we generalize [\cite=MS].

Let K be a semidualizing R-module and let [formula] and [formula] be two K  Gorenstein ideals. Assume that M1,M, and M2 are R-modules such that [formula] and [formula]. Then the following statements hold true.

K  R(M1) = K  R(M2);

If these dimensions are finite then M1 satisfies [formula] if and only if M2 satisfies [formula].

(i). By Theorem [\ref=G2], K  R(M1) <   ∞   if and only if [formula]. As by ([\ref=2]) and Lemma [\ref=G1], [formula], it follows that K  R(Mi) <   ∞   if and only if K  R(  nR(M,K)) <   ∞   for i = 1,2.

Now, let M1 and M2 have finite K  dimensions. Set [formula]. Note that, by Lemma [\ref=l2], n =   (M1)  ≤  K  R(M1). If n = K  R(M1) then M1 is K  perfect and so the assertion is obvious by Proposition [\ref=P3]. Now suppose that K  R(M1) > n. Hence by Theorem [\ref=G3], and Proposition [\ref=p4] the assertion is obvious.

(ii). By Lemma [\ref=G1], [formula] for all i  ≥  0 and so [formula]. Hence the assertion is obvious by Corollary [\ref=A].
