On Conditions Relating to Nonsolvability

In what follows, G is a finite group with identity 1G and [formula].

Thompson [\cite=T1968] proved the following : A finite group G is nonsolvable if and only if there are three elements x, y, and z in G#, whose orders are coprime in pairs, such that xyz = 1G.

How much tighter can one make this nonsolvability criterion? Can one always choose x, y, and z to be elements of prime-power order, for distinct primes obviously? Call a group that satisfies this condition a 3PPO-group (for three prime-power orders). So is a group nonsolvable if and only if it is a 3PPO-group? Can one always choose x, y, and z to be elements of prime order? Call a group that satisfies this condition a 3PO-group(for three prime orders).

In a recent paper [\cite=KL2010], Kaplan and Levy show that x, y, and z can be chosen so that x has order a power of 2, y has order a power of p for an odd prime p, and z has order coprime to 2p. In other words, two of the three elements can be chosen to have order a power of a prime. In addition, they show that every nonabelian simple group is a 3PO-group.

In this short note, we show that not every nonsolvable group is a 3PO-group and we exhibit a condition equivalent to 3PPO.

Our first result below shows SL(2,5), the group of 2  ×  2 matrices which entries in GF(5) and determinant 1, is not a 3PO-group. Since SL(2,5) is a non-split extension of a central subgroup of order 2 by A5, SL(2,5) has the smallest possible order of a nonsolvable group that is not simple and does not contain a simple group as a subgroup.

In SL(2,5), there do not exist elements x, y, and z in SL(2,5) of distinct prime orders with xyz = e.

In this proof, we use the character table of [formula] given on p. xxiv of [\cite=C1985] with its class labelings and its ordering of characters, which we label as χi with 1  ≤  i  ≤  9.

Now the only possibility for three elements in SL(2,5) to have distinct prime orders is for those orders to be 2, 3, and 5. The group SL(2,5) has one element of order 2, namely - I2, whose conjugacy class is labeled 1A1. In addition, SL(2,5) has one conjugacy class of elements of order 3 labeled 3A0, and two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5 labeled 5A0 and 5B0. Now denote - I2 by g2, an element of the conjugacy class 3A0 by g3, and elements of the conjugacy classes 5A0 and 5B0 by g5 and h5, respectively. Then

where the kth term on the right-hand side is [formula].

This right-hand side simplifies to

Similarly

By [\cite=D1971], these two calculations show that there are no elements x, y, and z of order 2, 3, and 5, respectively, in SL(2,5) such that xyz = 1SL(2,5).

We say that a group G is a 3SS-group (for three Sylow subgroups) if and only if there are three Sylow subgroups P1, P2, and P3 corresponding to three distinct primes p1, p2, and p3 dividing |G| such that |P1P2P3| < |P1||P2||P3|. (Here P1P2P3  =  {x1x2x3|xi∈Pi,1  ≤  i  ≤  3}.) Some time ago, Michael Ward and the present author tried unsuccessfully to prove that a group was nonsolvable if and only if it was a 3SS-group.

A finite group G is a 3PPO-group if and only if it it is a 3SS-group.

Suppose that G is a 3PPO-group. Then there are three distinct primes p1, p2, and p3 dividing |G|, and three elements x1, x2, and x3 in G#, such that xi is a pi-element for i = 1,2,3 and x1x2x3 = 1G. If, for i = 1,2,3, Pi is a Sylow pi-subgroup containing xi, then |P1P2P3| < |P1||P2||P3|, implying that G is a 3SS-group.

Suppose that G is a 3SS-group. Then there are three Sylow subgroups P1, P2, and P3 corresponding to three distinct primes p1, p2, and p3 dividing |G| such that |P1P2P3| < |P1||P2||P3|. This implies that there are distinct triples (x1,x2,x3) and (y1,y2,y3) in P1  ×  P2  ×  P3 such that x1x2x3 = y1y2y3, implying

[formula]

Since the triples are distinct, there is an i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  3 such that xi  ≠  yi. From this it follows that for every i, xi  ≠  yi. Thus y- 11x1, x2y- 12, and y2x3y- 13y- 12 are non-trivial elements of prime-power order for three distinct primes, and this implies that G is a 3PPO-group.

To our knowledge, the question of whether the condition 3PPO is equivalent to nonsolvability remains open.
