Comment on 'A general integral identity'

In a recent paper [\cite=G11], Glasser has derived the integral identity

[formula]

where F(u) is an arbitrary function, by following a relatively sophisticated method. At the end of his paper, Glasser states that 'The results derived here also follow from the invariance of an integral over the surface of an n-sphere under a permutation of the angular hyperspherical co-ordinates' and cites a private communication from the eminent physicist F J Dyson. The aim of this Comment is to provide a simple proof of Eq. [\eqref=1] based on symmetry arguments, thus fleshing out the details of the previous brief quotation.

First, we make the change of variables θ  →  π  -  θ to obtain

[formula]

Next, we perform the analogous change φ  →  π  -  φ. Thus,

[formula]

Now, let us assume that r > 0 (the case r < 0 can be treated separately in a similar way). In that case, the arguments of the function F in Eq. [\eqref=1] are positive. This implies that, when proving Eq. [\eqref=1], only F(u) for u > 0 matters and thus we are free to extend F(u) for u < 0. If we extend it as an even function, i.e., F( - u) = F(u), and make the change φ  →  φ  +  π in Eq. [\eqref=3], the result is

[formula]

This can be recognized as an integration over all the spatial directions of the function F evaluated at y = r sin θ sin φ in (three-dimensional) spherical coordinates, i.e.,

[formula]

where dΩ  =  dθdφ sin θ is the elementary solid angle.

Thus far, only formal manipulations in the integrals defining I(r) have been made. To conclude the proof of Eq. [\eqref=1] we simply take into account that, by symmetry, I(r) must be independent of the choice of Cartesian axes, so that we can freely replace F(y) by F(x) or F(z) inside the integral. In particular, the latter choice yields

[formula]

where the change θ  →  t =  cos θ has been made in the last step. Recalling the extension F( - u) = F(u), Eq. [\eqref=1] is finally obtained.
