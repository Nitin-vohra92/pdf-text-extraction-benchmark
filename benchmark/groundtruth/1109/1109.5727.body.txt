A possible statistical mechanism of anomalous neutrino velocity in OPERA experiment?

Consider a one-dimensional model which describes propagation of a beam of particles with the speed of light. The beam consists of protons with the density p(x,t), mesons with the density m(x,t) and neutrinos with the density n(x,t). The kinetic equations read

[formula]

where Γp,Γm,Γn are damping rates for protons, mesons and neutrinos respectively, while γp and γm describe transformation rated of protons into mesons and mesons into neutrinos.

The system of equations ([\ref=kinetic]) can be easily solved and for the initial conditions : p(x,0) = f(x) , m(x,0) = 0 and n(x,0) = 0 yields

[formula]

Under the physically justified condition Γn <  < Γp,Γm and for t >  > 1 / Γn the expression ([\ref=sol]) simplifies to

[formula]

which essentially coincides with the result of the previous version of this note. For the initial Gaussian density profile (concentrated at the origin for t = 0) the neutrino density evolves asymptotically as

[formula]

where d is the width of the density profile and N - the normalization constant. The time resolved density profile ([\ref=Gaussian]) at the point x  =  L >  > c / Γn can be recast into the form

[formula]

where the shift

[formula]

can be misinterpreted as a consequence of a higher velocity v≃c(1  +  δL / L). The origin of this shift is purely statistical, the neutrinos created at the longer distance from the proton source, and hence arriving earlier at the detector, are slightly less damped than those created at the shorter distance.

To apply this result to the OPERA experiment [\cite=OP] one should notice that in the experiment one compares the density profile for the protons - the "grandparents of the neutrinos" with the profile for neutrinos. The former is measured under conditions where damping can be neglected and the time-resolved shape does not display the shift δL. On the other hand, the highly damped density profile of neutrinos is shifted. The damping rate Γn describes an overall effect of all processes which reduce the fraction of neutrinos produced by the source in CERN which are detected in Gran Sasso Lab. Finally, one can compare the relevant numbers. The initial proton density profile is composed of five peaks which can be approximated by the Gaussians of the width d≃600m. This value combined with the value of L≃700km and the measured relative shift δL / L≃2.5  ×  10- 5 yield the overall damping factor (the prefactor γpγm  /  ΓpΓm is neglected)

[formula]

This value is consistent (within a reasonable accuracy) with the ratio Nν / Np  ~  10- 16 where Nν  ~  104 is the total number of neutrinos detected in OPERA and Np  ~  1020 is the number of the corresponding protons.
