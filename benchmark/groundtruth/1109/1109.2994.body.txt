Effect of proton-proton Coulomb repulsion on soft dipole excitations of light proton-rich nuclei

Properties of unstable nuclei with large excess of proton or neutron are one of the most important current topics of nuclear physics. In several radioactive beam facilities in the world, many unstable nuclei far from the β-stability line have been discovered[\cite=T8588] [\cite=Oza94] [\cite=Oza01] [\cite=Jon04]. In particular, neutron-rich unstable nuclei have been extensively studied and some exotic features have been observed. This includes a large concentration of the dipole strength distribution at low energies[\cite=F04] [\cite=N06], referred to as a "soft dipole excitation". This type of excitation is naively understood as an oscillation between weakly bound valence nucleon(s) and the core nucleus[\cite=IMKT10] [\cite=Sag95]. The relation between the soft dipole excitation and a largely extended density distribution, that is, a halo or skin property has been discussed for light neutron-rich nuclei, both experimentally [\cite=F04] [\cite=N06] [\cite=K89] [\cite=A90] [\cite=Shi95] [\cite=A99] [\cite=L01] [\cite=P03] and theoretically [\cite=HJ87] [\cite=BB88] [\cite=BE91] [\cite=EB92] [\cite=EBH97] [\cite=EHMS07]. Recently, the neutron halo structure has been discussed also in the 31Ne nucleus, based on the measured large Coulomb break-up cross sections[\cite=N09].

In contrast to neutron-rich nuclei, proton-rich nuclei have been less studied. It has not been fully clarified whether similar exotic features are present also in proton-rich nuclei. For instance, a proton halo structure in e.g., 8B, 12N, 17F, and 17Ne has been discussed[\cite=Sag95] [\cite=ZT95] [\cite=GPZ05] [\cite=GLSZ06], but no clear evidence has been obtained so far.

In order to investigate proton-rich unstable nuclei and discuss their similarities and differences to neutron-rich nuclei, it is indispensable to assess the effect of the Coulomb repulsion between valence protons. In the previous work, we analyzed the ground state properties of 17Ne using a three-body model [\cite=OHS10]. We have shown that the effect of the Coulomb repulsion is weak enough and the two valence protons in the ground state of 17Ne have a spatially compact configuration, that is, the diproton correlation, similar to a dineutron correlation in neutron-rich Borromean nuclei [\cite=HS0507] [\cite=MMS05] [\cite=M06] [\cite=PSS07] [\cite=KEHSS09]. We have also shown that the effect of the Coulomb interaction between the valence protons can be well accounted for by renormalizing the nuclear interaction. A similar conclusion was achieved recently also by Nakada and Yamagami, who performed Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations for N=20,28,50,82, and 126 isotones [\cite=NY11].

In this paper, as an continuation of the previous study, we discuss the effect of the Coulomb repulsion on excited states of 17Ne. Our interest is to investigate whether a similar renormalization for the Coulomb repulsion works also for the soft dipole excitation, which plays an important role in the astrophysical two-proton capture on 15O[\cite=GLSZ06].

We assume the 17Ne nucleus as a three-body system composed of an inert spherical core nucleus 15O and two valence protons. The three-body Hamiltonian in the three-body rest frame reads

[formula]

where m and AC are the nucleon mass and the mass number of the core nucleus, respectively. h(i) is the single-particle (s.p.) Hamiltonian for a valence proton, in which μ = mAC / (AC + 1) is the reduced mass and VpC is the potential between the proton and the core nucleus. The third term in Eq.([\ref=eq:3bh]) is a two-body part of the recoil kinetic energy of the core nucleus. For the proton-core potential VpC, we employ a Woods-Saxon (WS) plus Coulomb potential in the same manner as in the previous work [\cite=OHS10]. We use the same parameters for the WS potential as in those listed in Ref.[\cite=OHS10].

We solve the three-body Hamiltonian, Eq. ([\ref=eq:3bh]), by expanding the wave function on the uncorrelated basis as,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here, [formula] is a s.p. wave function with k = (n,l,j), while J and M are the total angular momentum of the two-proton subsystem and its z component, respectively. αk1,k2 is the expansion coefficient. The summation in Eq. ([\ref=eq:WF]) is restricted to those combinations which satisfy π = ( - )l1 + l2 for a state with parity π.

In the actual calculations shown below, we include the s.p. angular momentum l up to 5. We have confirmed that our results do not change significantly even if we include up to a larger value of l. In order to take into account the effect of the Pauli principle, we explicitly exclude the 1s1 / 2, 1p3 / 2, and 1p1 / 2 states from Eq. ([\ref=eq:WF]), which are occupied by the protons in the core nucleus.

For the pairing interaction [formula], we assume a density-dependent contact interaction [\cite=BE91] [\cite=EBH97] [\cite=HS0507] together with the Coulomb repulsion, [formula], as in the previous work [\cite=OHS10]. We take a cutoff energy Ecut = 30 MeV and include those configurations which satisfy

[formula]

where εnlj is a s.p. energy [\cite=EBH97]. Within this truncated space, we determine the strength of the nuclear part of the pairing interaction, [formula], using the empirical value of the neutron-neutron scattering length, ann =  - 18.5 fm [\cite=EBH97]. The parameters for the density dependence are adjusted so as to reproduce the experimental value of the two-proton separation energy of 17Ne, S2p = 0.944 MeV.

In our calculations, the continuum s.p. spectra are discretized within a box of Rbox=30 fm. Thus, energies of the two-proton 1- states as well as the E1 strength distribution are also discretized. The E1 strength function from the ground state is defined as

[formula]

where ωi = Ei - Eg.s., Eg.s. being the energy of the ground state, and μi is the B(E1) strength for i-th 1- two-proton state,

[formula]

with the E1 operator given by

[formula]

Using the strength function S(E), we can also calculate the k-th moment of energy defined as

[formula]

Notice that S0 and S1 correspond to the direct and energy-weighted sum of dB(E1) / dE, respectively.

From the completeness of the 1- basis, we can estimate the sum-rule-values as

[formula]

where [formula] is the distance between the center of mass of the two valence protons and the core nucleus. For the core nucleus 15O (AC = 15 and ZC = 8), we obtain S0,SR = 1.49 e2fm2 and S1,SR = 5.69 e2fm2MeV. Due to the Pauli forbidden transitions, the actual value of S0 is smaller than S0,SR, while S1 is larger than S1,SR.

Our main results are summarized in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1] and Table [\ref=tb:tb1]. For a plotting purpose, we smear the Dirac delta function in the E1 distribution S(E) with a Cauchy-Lorentz function

[formula]

with the width parameter Γ of 1.0 MeV. In order to discuss the effect of the Coulomb part of the pairing interaction, we also perform the calculations with two other treatments for the Coulomb interaction. One is to switch off the Coulomb interaction ("Nucl. only"), that is, [formula], keeping the same values for the parameters of the nuclear pairing interaction [formula] as in the full calculation ("Nucl.+Coul."). The other is again to use the nuclear interaction only, but renormalize the parameters, that is, [formula] ("Ren. Nucl."). To renormalize the interaction, we use the empirical proton-proton scattering length, app =  - 7.81 fm, instead of the neutron-neutron scattering length ann, and determine the other parameters so that the two-proton separation energy S2p is reproduced. This leads to about 10.0% reduction of the strength of the pairing interaction. Notice that this value for the reduction factor is consistent with the finding of Ref. [\cite=NY11]. See Ref.[\cite=OHS10] for further details of the procedure. For a comparison, we also show the results without any pairing interaction. These treatments for the Coulomb interaction are applied only to the excited states, while the same ground state wave function is used for all the cases. That is, the ground state is calculated with the full treatment of the Coulomb interaction, that yields 76% of (d5 / 2)2 and 16% of (s1 / 2)2. This ground state is used also for the no-pairing calculation for the dipole excitations. (These values for the occupation probabilities are slightly different from those in Ref.[\cite=OHS10], as we use a smaller Ecut in this paper. We have confirmed that the dipole strength distribution does not change much even though we use the smaller value of Ecut.) Notice that our results for S0 are consistent with the result of Grigorenko et al [\cite=GLSZ06], that is, S0 = 1.56 e2fm2 for (s1 / 2)2=48% and S0 = 1.07 e2fm2 for (s1 / 2)2=5%. Table [\ref=tb:tb1] also lists the centroid energy defined as [formula] [\cite=SSAR06], and its relative value with respect to the result of the full treatment of the Coulomb interaction.

From Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1] and Table [\ref=tb:tb1], we can see that the pairing interaction shifts considerably the E1 strength distribution towards the low energy region, similarly to the dipole distribution in neutron-rich nuclei [\cite=EHMS07] [\cite=N06]. This large shift of the E1 strength distribution originates mainly from the nuclear part of the pairing interaction. If the Coulomb part is switched off, the strength distribution is shifted only slightly, as is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1] by the dashed line. The shift of the centroid energy, δEcent, is only - 0.47MeV. The sign and the magnitude of δEcent is consistent with the result of Hartree-Fock+RPA calculations for medium-heavy nuclei shown in Ref. [\cite=SSAR06], although δEcent for the soft dipole excitation in 17Ne is somewhat larger.

The result with the renormalized nuclear pairing interaction is shown by the thin solid line in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1]. As one can see, the result of the full calculation (the thick solid line) is well reproduced by this prescription. We can thus conclude that the renormalization works well not only for the ground state [\cite=OHS10] [\cite=NY11], but also for the dipole excitations.

In summary, we discussed the influence of the Coulomb repulsion between the valence protons upon the soft dipole excitation in 17Ne. We showed that the effect of the Coulomb repulsion is so weak that the main feature of the dipole response is similar between neutron-rich and proton-rich weakly bound nuclei. We also showed that the effect of the Coulomb interaction can be well mocked up by renormalizing the nuclear pairing interaction. This renormalization works both for the ground state and for the dipole excitations, and thus from a practical point of view one can use a renormalized pairing interaction in order to understand the structure of proton-rich nuclei.

One of the current topics of proton-rich nuclei is two-proton radioactivity. Bertulani, Hussein, and Verde argued that the final state interaction plays an important role in discussing the energy and the angular correlations in a two-proton emission process [\cite=BHV08]. It would be an interesting future work to investigate how the renormalization works for those correlations. A work towards this direction is now in progress.
