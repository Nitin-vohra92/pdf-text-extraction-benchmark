Mutually unbiased bases for quantum states defined over [formula]-adic numbers

Mutually Unbiased Bases

Let [formula] and [formula] be two orthonormal bases for the d-dimensional Hilbert space [formula]. We say that V and W are mutually unbiased bases (mubs) if and only if all vectors of V are a uniform, unbiased superposition in terms of the W vectors, and vice versa. It is straightforward to show that this is equivalent with the requirement [formula] for all [formula]. A set {V1,...,VN} of bases is mutually unbiased if and only if each proper pair [formula] (with [formula]) of bases is mutually unbiased. As an example, for the qubit d = 2 case we have a set of three mubs: V1  =  {|0〉,|1〉}, [formula], and [formula]. Mutually unbiased bases play an important role in the problem of optimal quantum state estimation [\cite=WoottersFields], quantum cryptography [\cite=Cerfetal] and the construction of discrete Wigner functions [\cite=Cormicketal].

A central question in the theory of finite dimensional mubs is what the maximal cardinality [formula] is of a set of mubs for a given dimension d. It can be shown that [formula] and we also know that if d is a power of a prime, pr, then this bound can achieved: [formula] . (Below we will give an explicit construction of pr + 1 mubs in [formula].) For dimensions that are not a prime power, the same question is wide open. For d = 6 we know that there are 3 mubs and several extensive numerical computations suggest that this is largest possible number of mubs in [formula]. However, despite significant efforts on this [formula] question, we still do not have a rigorous proof that excludes the possibility that [formula]. More generally for [formula] it is known that [formula] (Lemma 3 in [\cite=ConstructionsofMUBs]), but to strengthen this bound has proven to be difficult, although not impossible for certain very specific cases [\cite=WocjanBeth].

The "[formula] construction" of [formula] MUBs in dimension [formula]

It is notable that, although the question of mubs is a purely geometric one, the constructions often involve nontrivial results in number theory. The following construction of a maximal set of pr + 1 mutually unbiased bases in [formula] is a quintessential example of this .

Let p be a prime and [formula] a positive exponent. Using the finite field [formula] and its trace operation [formula] with [formula], we define the following set of pr bases Va indexed by [formula]:

[formula]

Combined with the computational basis [formula], the set of pr + 1 bases [formula] is mutually unbiased. This fact can be proven using standard results on quadratic Gauss sums [\cite=GaussSums]. That the [formula] vectors are mutually unbiased to the Va vectors follows trivially from the fact that all amplitudes of all v(a,b) have norm [formula]. To prove that the Va bases are mutually unbiased one should first observe that

[formula]

The mutually unbiasedness is then proven by the following result on quadratic Gauss sums over finite fields

[formula]

Gauss sums [formula] over a ring [formula] behave 'less nicely' when d is not prime, which prevents the above (ax2 + bx) construction to work for arbitrary dimensions d. Nevertheless, we will use this construction to find mubs for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.

MUBs for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces?

It is a non-trivial question to ask if one can define mutually unbiased bases for infinity dimensional Hilbert space and, if this is indeed possible, how many mubs exist in such spaces. Weigert and Wilkinson[\cite=MUBsContinuousVariables] did exactly this for quantum variables defined over the real line and they found only 3 mubs in this Hilbert space [formula]. The three bases they found were the (generalized) eigenvectors of operators that are a combination of the position operator [formula] and the momentum operator p̂; the three operators they used are [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Our Result

Partly in response to the [formula] result of Weigert and Wilkinson, Blume-Kohout wondered 'Is ∞   prime? or possibly a multiple of 2?" [\cite=Blume-Kohout]. The idea being that if the infinite dimension of [formula] is 'prime', we would expect [formula], whereas if the dimension is even, then maybe indeed [formula], just as we seem to have [formula]. Our result here shows that the answer to Blume-Kohout's question likely depends on properties of the Hilbert space that go beyond the fact that its dimensionality is infinite. We do this by considering quantum states that are defined over the p-adic numbers [formula], i.e. we look at mubs in the infinite dimensional Hilbert space [formula]. Using the (ax2 + bx) construction of the previous section and the theory of quadratic Gauss integrals over [formula], we show that for each prime p > 2 one has the lower bound [formula].

For functions in [formula] we have a well-defined notion of continuity and [formula] is an infinite, locally compact Abelian group, just like [formula]. In this sense, [formula] defines a continuous variable that is different from [formula] and one can study the idea of "p-adic quantum mechanics", which has been done already by various authors . In the next section we will provide the necessary definitions to work with the Hilbert space [formula]. After that, in Section [\ref=sec:padicMUBs], we describe a construction of p + 1 mubs in this space, and prove their mutually unbiasedness. In the last two sections we address the question why mubs for real valued variables seem to behave differently from those defined over [formula].

p-adic Quantum Mechanics

[formula]-adic numbers

An excellent introduction to p-adic numbers is provided by Gouvêa [\cite=Gouvea]; here we will mostly recite the necessary basic definitions. Consider the possible norms on the field of rational numbers [formula]. Besides the standard [formula] norm, we also have the p-adic norm |  ·  |p for each prime integer p as a possibility, which is defined as follows. For [formula], write x  =  pv(a / b) where v,a,b are all integers and p does not divide a or b. The [formula] is called the valuation vp(x) of x; additionally we define vp(0): =  +   ∞  . The p-adic norm is defined by |x|p: = p- vp(x). The completion of [formula] under this norm gives rise to the p-adic numbers [formula]. The p-adic integers [formula] in [formula] are those elements [formula] with |z|p  ≤  1, i.e. those with vp(z)  ≥  0. (The ring of p-adic integers [formula] should not be confused with the field [formula] of integers modulo p, although some authors denote this field also by [formula].) Note that with this norm, the limit lim k  →    +    ∞pk converges to 0, and hence 1 +  lim k  →    +    ∞(pk - 1)  =  0, showing that [formula] in [formula]. The observation supports the following notation.

Each nonzero p-adic number [formula] can be described by the formal power series

[formula]

The sets [formula] and [formula] are both uncountable; [formula] is compact, while [formula] is only locally compact. Just as the field [formula] shares many properties with [formula], the ring [formula] has several similarities with [formula].

For each [formula] its fractional part is defined by [formula]. For all [formula] we have that {z} is a rational number from the set [formula]; one can also view this value as [formula]. We define the function [formula] by [formula] such that |e(x)| = 1 for all x. Note that, while {x + y} does not always equal {x}  +  {y}, it does hold that e(x + y)  =  e(x)e(y), making e an additive character of [formula] that is trivial on [formula]. For each [formula] the [formula] function x  ↦  e(αx) is an additive character on [formula] and all characters can be expressed this way, hence [formula] is its own Pontryagin dual [\cite=FourierNumberField]. For characters over [formula] we have that e(αx)  =  e((α + 1)x) for all [formula], which shows that only the fractional part of α matters in this context. Indeed one can show that the dual of [formula] is equivalent to the group [formula].

Measures on [formula], quantum states over [formula], and [formula]

The standard, normalized Haar measure μ on [formula] is given by [formula] such that [formula] and, for [formula], we have [formula] where z + S  =  {z + x:x∈S}. Notice that [formula]. From now on, an integral [formula] is understood to be taken with respect to this measure. The Hilbert space [formula] has as its elements

[formula]

A function/quantum state ψ is normalized when [formula].

Fourier transforms in [formula]

For a function [formula], its Fourier transform [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Fix [formula] and [formula]. Define the function [formula] by

[formula]

Notice that ψ is normalized with [formula] and that with the p-adic distance between the elements of [formula] this indicator function is continuous. The Fourier transform of ψ is described by

[formula]

As the Fourier transform is a isometry from [formula] to itself (under the natural inner product given by Haar measure), such ψ are the natural [formula]-equivalents of the Gaussian distribution over [formula] with r acting as the scale.

(p + 1) Mutually Unbiased Bases in [formula]

Just as in the [formula] case of Weigert and Wilkinson [\cite=MUBsContinuousVariables], our mubs are 'generalized' eigenstates, meaning that they are not properly normalized. To deal with this issue we will use the standard technique of describing them as a limit of functions that are elements of [formula]. The limit that we will rely upon is [formula] (as sets). (All of this can be made more rigorous by casting it in the framework of 'rigged' Hilbert spaces [\cite=Ballentine].) We allow ourselves the slight abuse of notation where

[formula]

For each [formula] we define the following sets [formula] indexed by [formula]:

[formula]

The following lemma regarding the norm of quadratic Gauss integrals over [formula] is proven in Lemma [\ref=lem:gausssumQp] in Appendix [\ref=app:gaussintegrals].

Let [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

Additionally we define the set [formula] as

[formula]

Note that the v(  ∞  ,b;r) is the Fourier transform of v(0,b;r) and that the [formula] vectors act like the scaled delta-functions [formula] as r  →    ∞  .

In Corollary [\ref=cor:VaMUB] in Appendix [\ref=app:gaussintegrals] it is proven that for all [formula] and [formula] for large enough r we have

[formula]

As mentioned before, in the limit r  →    +    ∞   we have [formula] as sets. Hence with the definitions and results of this section we obtain the main theorem of this article.

With the above definitions, all sets [formula] and V(  ∞  )a with [formula] are a basis for [formula]. For [formula] it holds that a - a' = 0 or vp(a - a') = 0 and hence we have that [formula] makes a set of p + 1 mutually unbiased bases in [formula] such that for all [formula] we have the unbiased inner product [formula] when a  ≠  a'.

In the r  →    ∞   limit the functions v(a,b;r)∈V(r)a are described by

[formula]

for all [formula]. The elements of [formula] are the Fourier transforms of the V(  ∞  )0 functions:

[formula]

In Appendix [\ref=app:unitaryMUB] we have a description of these (p + 1) mubs as eigenfunctions of (p + 1) families of unitary transformations on [formula].

Difference for MUBs between [formula] and [formula]

Why is it that we have p + 1 mubs over the p-adic numbers [formula], while we only know of 3 mubs over the reals [formula]?

If we want to adapt the (ax2 + bx) construction to the case of quantum states defined over [formula], we can use the normalized Gaussian distribution

[formula]

(which in the limit k  →    +    ∞   gives the 'uniform distribution over [formula]'), to define the basis states

[formula]

For the relevant integral we then get

[formula]

which shows that for different bases Ba and Ba' we have the dependency

[formula]

Note now how the norm of the quadratic Gauss integral in Lemma [\ref=lem:gausssumQp] also has a [formula] dependency, giving the same kind of dependency of Equation [\ref=eq:proptoa]. For [formula] however, the |a| is the p-adic norm with |a| = p- vp(a), which is much more coarse than the standard [formula] norm. If A is a set of a coefficients, then {Ba:a∈A} defines a set of mubs if |a - a'|  =  |a'' - a'''| for all a  ≠  a',a''  ≠  a'''∈A. For the [formula]-norm the maximum set A with this property is A = {0,1}, while for the p-adic norm we can have [formula].

Conclusion and Open Questions

We have found that there are at least p + 1 mubs if we consider quantum states defined over the p-adic numbers [formula], while we only know of 3 mubs for quantum states defined over the real line [formula]. An obvious open question is: are these numbers tight, or is it possible to define more mubs over [formula] and/or [formula]? Upon closer inspection, one can see that the reason why the (ax2 + bx) construction leads to different MUB situations for [formula] and [formula] stems from the fact that their respective norms have different properties. It is another open question if this analysis is only specific to the (ax2 + bx) construction that we used here, or if this in fact the reason why we might have different numbers of mubs for [formula] and [formula].

Quadratic Gauss Sums and Integrals

The results in this appendix are not new; see for example Equation 2.11 in [\cite=Vladimirov]. The two main reasons to provide these proofs here is to make the currently article self-contained and to give the reader a flavor of how to do calculations in [formula].

Quadratic Gauss sums over finite rings [formula]

The following lemma regarding the norm of quadratic sums over [formula] will be used to prove Lemma [\ref=lem:gausssumQp] about the norm of quadratic Gauss integrals over p-adic numbers.

Let p  ≠  2 be a prime, [formula] with [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The quadratic Gauss sum has the following norm

[formula]

Because ωz is an additive character over [formula] we can interpret the values ax2 + bx modulo [formula]. Define and note

[formula]

To ignore the phase of g, we look at the norm of gg*  =  |g|2:

[formula]

At this stage we need to calculate how many solutions [formula] there are to the linear equation [formula], which depends on the values of a and b modulo [formula]. We will have to analyze several cases that can occur depending on whether a or b equal [formula] and the two valuations vp(a) and vp(b). If [formula], we will write a = αpvp(a) with [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, if [formula], we will write b = βpvp(b) with [formula] and [formula].

If [formula] and [formula], then there are [formula] solutions [formula].

If [formula] and [formula], then there are no solutions.

If [formula] and [formula] the equation [formula] can be re-expressed as [formula], which has pvp(a) solutions [formula].

If [formula] and vp(a)  ≤  vp(b), there are pvp(a) solutions the equation [formula], namely [formula].

If [formula] and vp(a) > vp(b) there are no solutions to the equation [formula] as [formula].

Summarizing we have

[formula]

The combination of Equations [\ref=eq:k_equals_l], [\ref=eq:simplifies_to] and [\ref=eq:summarizing] proves the lemma.

Quadratic Gauss integrals over [formula]-adic numbers

With Lemma [\ref=lem:gausssumfinitering], the following result can be proven.

Let [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

Define and rewrite

[formula]

Assume without loss of generality that [formula]. Using the previous lemma on Gauss sums over [formula] and the fact that [formula] and [formula] we get

[formula]

Let [formula]. Define a threshold value [formula] as follows. If a = 0 and b = 0 then t =  -   ∞  ; if a = 0 and b  ≠  0 then t = vp(b); if a  ≠  0 then t =  max {vp(a) / 2,vp(a) - vp(b)}. Then, for every r > t we have

[formula]

This last corollary shows that for any [formula] as r gets 'big enough', we have the three cases of Equation [\ref=eq:bigenoughr] for the norm of the quadratic Gauss sum. Hence for the case a  ≠  0 or b  ≠  0 we have the r  →    +    ∞   limit

[formula]

The [formula] functions of Equation [\ref=eq:Vinfdef] have the same size and orthogonality as the Va functions as is shown by the following lemma.

Use the definitions of Equation [\ref=eq:Vinfdef] and let [formula]. There exists a threshold [formula] such that for all r > t we have

[formula]

[formula]

Hence we can t be as follows: if b = b', set t =  -   ∞  ; if b  ≠  b', set t = v(b - b').

The next simple lemma is needed to prove that the [formula] functions of the main theorem are mutually unbiased to the Va functions of Equation [\ref=eq:Vadef].

Let [formula]. There exists a threshold [formula] such that for all r  ≥  t:

A Unitary Description of the (p + 1) MUBs in [formula]

As was mentioned in Section [\ref=sec:L2RMUBs], the three mubs in [formula] can be described as the eigenstates of three Hermitian operators that are combinations of the momentum operator p̂ and the position operator [formula]. When trying to mimic this approach for the (p + 1) mubs in [formula] one quickly realizes that some complications arise due to the difference between [formula] and [formula]. A very concrete example of this complication is the fact that the position operator :|x〉  ↦  x|x〉 does not make sense in this setting as it tries to assign the [formula] valued position value x as an amplitude. As a way out, we will we will omit the Hamiltonian description and instead capture the mubs in terms of the eigenfunctions of (p + 1) families of unitary transformations on [formula].

Define the two sets of unitary operators Xc and [formula] with the parameters [formula] by

[formula]

(As XcZd:|y〉  ↦  e(yd)|y + c〉 and ZdXc:|y〉  ↦  e(yd + cd)|y + c〉, we have the expected relation ZdXc  =  e(cd)XcZd.)

For [formula] take d = 2ac and observe that

[formula]

which shows that the v(a,b;  ∞  ) in V(  ∞  )a are the eigenfunctions of XcZ2ac (for all [formula]). Additionally, informally speaking, the (generalized) eigenfunctions of Zd are those proportional to |y〉, which are exactly the elements of [formula].

Define the following unitary operator [formula] for all [formula] by

[formula]

We immediately have Pd:|v(a,b;  ∞  )〉  ↦  |v(a + d,b;  ∞  )〉. We also have, again informally speaking, [formula]. Hence all V(  ∞  )a bases can be obtained through a unitary transformation from the V(  ∞  )0 basis. As [formula] is exactly the set of characters x  ↦  e(bx) of [formula], it is the 'Fourier basis' of [formula]. By the just described unitary relation between the different bases, we thus have that V(  ∞  )a is a basis of [formula] for all [formula].
