Equivariant Kählerian extensions of contact manifolds

Introduction

Manifolds with additional structure can sometimes be understood better if the structure extends to a complexification of the manifold. By a result of Whitney ([\cite=Whitney-analytic-extensions]) and Shutrick ([\cite=Shutrick]) a differentiable manifold M can be embedded as a closed, real analytic and totally real submanifold of a complex manifold Mc with the dimension [formula]. Using his solution of the Levi problem Grauert ([\cite=Grauert]) proved that the complexification Mc can be realized as a Stein manifold, in particular, it can be holomorphically and properly embedded in some [formula]. During the last two decades, complexifications of real manifolds with additional structure achieved some attention. An equivariant version for proper actions has been shown in [\cite=Heinzner-equivariant-extensions]. Stratmann ([\cite=Stratmann]) considers proper actions of Lie groups G on symplectic manifolds (M,ω) and shows that there is a Stein complexification Mc of M with a G-invariant Kähler form τ such that [formula] where [formula] is the embedding of M in Mc.

In this paper a similar extension result is shown for 1-forms. Contact manifolds (M,η) on which a Lie group G acts properly by contact transformations are of particular interest. As a general assumption in this work the Lie group G has finitely many connected components, is extendable, i.e., the natural homomorphism [formula] is injective, and is acting properly on M as a group of diffeomorphisms. In Section [\ref=Extension_of_forms] an equivariant complexification [formula] such that G acts on Mc properly by holomorphic transformations and a strictly plurisubharmonic, G-invariant function [formula] are constructed with the property that [formula] For this, a slice construction for M  =  G  ×  KS, K maximal compact in G, is used to construct a complexification Mc of M by a complexification [formula] of G  ×  S:

[formula]

The interplay of complexifications and contact reductions and Kählerian reductions is discussed in the remaining section. Roughly speaking, the complexifications of contact reductions of a G-contact manifold (M,η) can be seen as the Kählerian reduction of the complexification. This is shown along a simultaneous stratification of both the contact manifold and its complexification.

Extension of forms

Let G be an extendable Lie group. Let M be a real analytic G-manifold with a 1-form η. In this section the form is extended to a complexification Mc of M. This is done equivariantly for groups acting on M and leaving η invariant.

Equivariant extensions in the case of compact groups

Let K be a compact transformation group and let M be a K-manifold with a K-invariant 1-form η. In the following, an equivariant complexification Mc of M is constructed to which η is extended equivariantly.

Let K be a compact Lie group, M a K-manifold and η be a K-invariant 1-form. Then there are a K-equivariant complexification Mc of M and a K-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that

[formula]

First, the local sitiation without the presence of symmetries is considered. By a theorem of Whitney ([\cite=Whitney-diff-mfd], Theorem 1) M can be given an atlas with a real analytic structure. It can also be assumed that the action map K  ×  M  →  M is real analytic ([\cite=Japaner]). Let X be a complexification of M such that [formula] is a real analytic, closed embedding ([\cite=Whitney-Bruhat]). It can be assumed that X is a Stein manifold ([\cite=Grauert]). Let (Uα,φα)α∈I be an atlas of real analytic charts [formula]. Every map φ- 1α:φα(Uα)  →  Uα extends biholomorphically to a map [formula], where Wα is an open and connected neighbourhood of Uα in X and [formula] is open in [formula]. Then [formula] is an open submanifold of X containing M. After shrinking, this set can be chosen as a Stein neighbourhood Mc of M in X ([\cite=Grauert]). The biholomorphic maps [formula] have inverse biholomorphic maps, denoted here by [formula], which give an atlas [formula] of Mc. Note that [formula] is an open neighbourhood of [formula] in [formula]. Let [formula] be coordinates on [formula] and [formula] coordinates on [formula]. There are uniquely defined smooth functions [formula] such that

[formula]

On [formula] the function [formula], defined by

[formula]

satisfies [formula] and this implies that

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the restriction [formula]. Then [formula] has the properties [formula] and [formula] for the embedding [formula]. If p∈Uα, the sets U(p): = Uα and W(p): = Wα have the desired properties. These locally defined function can be patched together to obtain a function [formula] such that [formula]. So far, symmetries are not yet considered. There is a Stein complexification Mc of M and an atlas [formula] such that [formula] is an atlas [formula] and a function [formula] with the properties

[formula]

for the embedding [formula]. After shrinking and refining there is an atlas (Vβ,φβ)β∈J of Mc with a partition of unity (χβ)β∈J. Since every Vβ  ⊂  Wα(β) for some α(β), it is possible to define ϱβ: = ϱα(β)|Vβ. Property ([\ref=eta-iota]) implies that for the case that [formula] is non-empty, [formula] and

[formula]

Define now for every function ϱβ the smooth functions

[formula]

The function [formula], [formula], is well-defined by local finiteness and smooth, too. Property ([\ref=rho=0]) implies

[formula]

Possibly after shrinking Mc a strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] with the property [formula] such that ϱ  -  ν is strictly plurisubharmonic on an open neighbourhood of M and still satisfies [formula]. The construction of a function ν with these properties can be found in ([\cite=HHL], Lemma 2). Now let M be a K-manifold and let η be a K-invariant 1-form. There is a K-equivariant complexification Mc of M ([\cite=Heinzner-equivariant-extensions], [\cite=Japaner], Theorem 1.3). In particular K acts on Mc by holomorphic transformations and [formula] is a K-equivariant embedding. Perhaps after shrinking to a smaller K-invariant complexification Mc has a smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that [formula] as shown above. Then [formula] defines a K-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function on Mc such that

[formula]

where ψk:Mc  →  Mc, [formula], for all k∈K.

Equivariant extensions for the case of proper actions

An extendable Lie group is characterized by the injectivity of the canonical G-equivariant homomorphism [formula], where [formula] is the universal complexification. The aim of this subsection is the following result.

Let G be an extendable Lie group with finitely many connected components that acts properly on a manifold M and let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let η be a smooth G-invariant 1-form on M. The slice S  ⊂  M is embedded in a Stein [formula]-manifold [formula] such that M  =  G  ×  KS is complexified by a G  ×  K-invariant Stein domain [formula]. Then there is a G-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that

[formula]

The proof of this at the end of the section needs some preperation. Let G be an extendable Lie group with finitely many connected components and let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G. By a theorem of Abels ([\cite=Abels]) there is a K-invariant submanifold S in M such that the map

[formula]

is a diffeomorphism. Here, G  ×  KS denotes the geometric quotient of G  ×  S with respect to the free K-action

[formula]

and [g,s]: = πK(g,s), where πK:G  ×  S  →  G  ×  KS is the canonical projection onto their geometric quotient. There is a real analytic structure on [formula] such that the action map G  ×  M  →  M, the slice S and the K-action on S may be assumed to be real analytic ([\cite=Illman], [\cite=Kutzschebauch-uniqueness]). In ([\cite=HHK], Section 7, Proposition 4, 4' and 5) a complexification of G  ×  KS is constructed with the help of a G-complexification Gc of G and a K-complexification Sc of S as the quotient [formula]. In this quotient two points p1 and p2 are identified if f(p1)  =  f(p2) for every K-invariant holomorphic function f. Since G is assumed to be extendable here, a G-complexification can be realized as a [formula]-manifold as in [\cite=HHK]. The proof is included here for the readers' convenience.

Let an extendable Lie group G act properly and real analytically on a manifold M  =  G  ×  KS, where K is a maximal compact subgroup of G. Then there is a [formula]-manifold [formula] such that a G-invariant domain Ω in [formula] is a G-complexification of M  =  G  ×  KS.

The slice S can be K-equivariantly complexified in a Stein [formula]-space [formula] ([\cite=Heinzner-geometric-invariant-stein], Section 6.6). Since G is extendable, it can be complexified G-equivariantly to a G-invariant open domain Gc in [formula]. Then [formula] can be G-equivariantly embedded in [formula] as a totally real submanifold. If Mc is a G-complexification of M, a G-invariant domain Ω containing M in Mc can be G-equivariantly, holomorphically and openly embedded in a neighbourhood of M in [formula] ([\cite=HHK], Corollary 7).

Following the notation introduced above consider a proper and real analytic action on M. Then M  =  G  ×  KS. Let η be a G-invariant smooth 1-form on M. Denote by πG:G  ×  S  →  G and πS:G  ×  S  →  S the projections on the first and on the second factor respectively.

Let η be a G-invariant, smooth 1-form on G  ×  KS. Let [formula] be a basis of G-invariant 1-forms on G. Then there are smooth functions [formula] and a K-invariant 1-form σS on S such that

[formula]

such that [formula] is a G  ×  K-invariant 1-form.

The form [formula] is a G  ×  K-invariant, smooth 1-form on G  ×  S. Let [formula] be a basis of G-invariant 1-forms on G; then [formula] are their trivial extensions to G  ×  S. The embedding ιS:S  →  G  ×  S, s  ↦  (e,s), and the projection πS:G  ×  S  →  S, (g,s)  ↦  s, are K-equivariant if K acts diagonally on G  ×  S by [formula]. Let [formula]; then [formula] is G  ×  K-invariant and for every tangent vector [formula]

[formula]

It follows that [formula] for every v∈TsS and every h∈G. In other words [formula]. This implies that there are smooth functions [formula] on G  ×  S such that

[formula]

Comparing coefficients implies that there are smooth functions [formula] on S such that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=compact-extension] implies that there is a K-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] on an equivariant K-complexification Sc of S such that [formula]. Assume that the situation is arranged as in Proposition [\ref=KC-mfd]. Let Sc be openly and K-equivariantly embedded in a [formula]-manifold [formula] and let Gc be a Stein G-complexification of G which is G-equivariantly and openly embedded in [formula]. In the next proposition, G  ×  K-invariant 1-forms on G  ×  S are going to be extended equivariantly to Gc  ×  Sc.

For the smooth G  ×  K-invariant 1-form [formula] on G  ×  S there is a G  ×  K-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function ϱ on some G  ×  K-invariant complexification Gc  ×  Sc such that on a G  ×  K-invariant Stein domain Ω in Gc  ×  Sc

[formula]

Let [formula] be a basis of G-invariant 1-forms on G and [formula] and [formula] be as above in Proposition [\ref=prop-frame]. Let Gc be a Stein complexification of G which is G-equivariant with respect to the left G-multiplication. Shrinking Gc if necessary, Lemma 3.3 in [\cite=Stratmann] and Theorem 1 in [\cite=Winkelmann] imply that there are G-invariant functions [formula] on Gc such that [formula] for [formula]. It can be assumed that [formula]. There is a complexification Sc of S with functions [formula] such that [formula] for [formula]. The G-invariant function

[formula]

satisfies [formula] with the projections πGc:Gc  ×  Sc  →  Gc and πSc:Gc  ×  Sc  →  Sc. Now, the property [formula] implies

[formula]

After shrinking Sc Proposition [\ref=compact-extension] shows that there is a strictly plurisubharmonic K-invariant function [formula] such that [formula]. Define the G  ×  K-invariant function ϱ by

[formula]

Then [formula], and ϱ is a G  ×  K-invariant function. A partition of unity argument, worked out in Lemma 3.10 in [\cite=Stratmann], which is e.g. shows that ϱ can be assumed both G  ×  K-invariant and strictly plurisubharmonic.

Recall the original goal to extend a G-invariant 1-form η to an equivariant complexification of G  ×  KS. This will be achieved with the help of Kählerian reduction of Gc  ×  Sc with respect to the freely acting compact group K. Details on the momentum map geometry and on Kählerian reduction can be found e.g. in [\cite=Heinzner-geometric-invariant-stein], [\cite=Heinzner-Loose], [\cite=Sjamaar]. The basic properties needed here are mentioned briefly in the remaining section.

Let (Ω,ω) be a Kähler manifold and let L be a Lie group which acts symplectically and by holomorphic transformations on Ω, i.e., [formula] for every g∈L, where ψ:L  ×  Ω  →  Ω is the action map. The action is called Hamiltonian if there is a moment map [formula], where [formula] is the dual vector space to the Lie algebra of L, with the following properties:

The map μ is L-equivariant with respect to the given action on Ω and the coadjoint action of L on [formula].

For every [formula] the function [formula], x  ↦  〈μ(x),ξΩ(x)〉, satisfies ιξΩω  =  dμξ, where [formula] and ιξΩω is the 1-form given by (ιξΩω)(v)  =  ω(ξΩ,v) for every v∈TM.

If Ω carries a differentiable, L-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula], the action is Hamiltonian with respect to the Kähler metric ω  =    -  ddcϱ. In this case, a moment map is given by μξ(x)  =  (dcϱ)(ξΩ(x)). For Hamiltonian actions, the momentum zero level [formula] allows one to define the reduced space [formula].

Let L act freely and properly by holomorphic and symplectic transformations on a Kähler manifold (Ω,ω). Assume that the action is Hamiltonian with moment map [formula]. Let [formula] be openly, holomorphically and L-equivariantly embedded in a complex [formula]-manifold X on which [formula] acts freely such that [formula] is a smooth complex manifold and [formula] a submersion. Then the map

[formula]

is a local diffeomorphism and defines a unique complex structure on [formula] such that κ is a locally biholomorphic map of complex manifolds.

Since [formula], x∈X, implies that [formula] everywhere, μ- 1(0) is a smooth submanifold of Ω. The fact that L acts freely and properly implies that [formula] is likewise a differentiable manifold. Furthermore, for a point x0∈μ- 1(0),

[formula]

In the commutative diagram

[formula]

the maps [formula] and [formula] are submersions with kernels [formula] and [formula] respectively. It follows that [formula] maps [formula] bijectively onto [formula] and Dπμ- 1(0) maps bijectively onto [formula]. This implies that Dκ(πμ- 1(0)(x0)) is everywhere an isomorphism.

Let Ω  ⊂  Gc  ×  Sc be a G  ×  K-invariant Stein domain, G  ×  S  ⊂  Ω, and [formula] a G  ×  K-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function such that [formula].

There are G-invariant Stein domains [formula] containing G  ×  KS and [formula] containing G  ×  KS which are G-equivariantly biholomorphic.

First, it has to be shown that G  ×  S  ⊂  μ- 1(0). For this, the following calculation proves that for every [formula] and every (g,s)∈G  ×  S,

[formula]

Since K acts freely and commutes with the G-action, [formula]is a G-manifold and, by Proposition [\ref=free-proper-case], obtains a complex structure by the map

[formula]

which is a local diffeomorphism. Since the restriction κ|G  ×  KS defines a real analytic, G-equivariant isomorphism between two copies of G  ×  KS in [formula] and in [formula] respectively, there are G-invariant and biholomorphic Stein neighbourhoods Ω1 of G  ×  KS in [formula] and Ω2 of G  ×  KS in [formula] ([\cite=HHK], Corollary 7).

It remains to show how to use the extension of [formula] on Gc  ×  Sc for an extension of η on G  ×  KS. This is carried out in the proof of the Theorem [\ref=Komplexifizierungssatz], which can now be carried out.

By Proposition [\ref=G-times-K-invariante-function] there is a Stein G  ×  K-complexification [formula] of G  ×  S and a strictly plurisubharmonic G  ×  K-invariant function [formula] such that [formula] The moment map [formula] is defined for the K-action on Ω. For the existence of the following quotients, note that the relevant groups K and [formula] respectively act freely. Thanks to Proposition [\ref=Kempf-Ness-free-case] the diagram

[formula]

commutes. It shows that there is a canonically defined complex structure on [formula]. Note that the G-action on Ω induces a natural G-action by holomorphic transformations on the quotient [formula], because the G-action and the K-action on Ω commute. The function [formula] which is induced by [formula] is G-invariant and has the property

[formula]

Then the G  ×  K-equivariant embedding [formula] induces a G-equivariant embedding [formula] The strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] on [formula] has the property that

[formula]

To see this, consider the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Since [formula] surjectivity of πK implies that [formula].

Complexifications of contact and symplectic manifolds

In the case where M is a contact manifold Theorem [\ref=Komplexifizierungssatz] can be reformulated in the sense that the 1-form η can be extended to a 1-form ηc, e.g. ηc: = dcϱ, on a Stein G-complexification Mc:

Every contact manifold (M,η) with a proper G-action of a Lie group G with finitely many connected components can be complexified equivariantly to a Stein G-complexification Mc with a G-invariant 1-form ηc such that [formula] for the embedding [formula].

A similar result for symplectic manifolds is proved by Stratmann ([\cite=Stratmann]).

A contact manifold (M,η) can be symplectified, i.e., it can be extended naturally to a symplectic manifold: If (M,η) is a (2n + 1)-dimensional contact manifold, the two-form

[formula]

on [formula] is symplectic. Here, t denotes the standard coordinate on the [formula]-factor of [formula]. A contact-form η on M induces a symplectic form [formula], where t is the coordinate on [formula] and [formula] projects on the first factor. The complex extension of M to Mc induces a complex extension of [formula] to [formula]. This means that η extends to [formula] on Mc and d(etη  +  dt) extends to ddcϱ on Ω.

The symplectification is compatible with the extension to complexifications in the following sense.

Let (M,η) be a smooth contact manifold. Then there is a Stein complexification Mc of M and an open neighbourhood Ω of [formula] in [formula] such that there exists a strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] for which

[formula]

for the embeddings [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

There is a complexification Mc of M and a strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that [formula]. Then the function

[formula]

has the property (dcϱ)  =  et  ·  dcϱM  -  ϱM  ·  etds where z = t + is. In particular, [formula] and

[formula]

If [formula] is a strictly plurisubharmonic function with the property [formula] and [formula], Proposition [\ref=compact-extension] can be applied to

[formula]

and to ϱ to obtain a strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] on a Stein neighbourhood Ω of [formula] in [formula].

Proposition [\ref=symp-d^c-rho] also has an equivariant version:

If G  ×  M  →  M is a proper G-action, there is a proper extension to Mc: The trivial extension to an action on [formula] defines equivariant embeddings

[formula]

such that [formula] can be chosen to be strictly plurisubharmonic and G-invariant on [formula].

It has just to be observed that in the proof of Proposition [\ref=symp-d^c-rho] the function [formula] can be chosen to be G-invariant by Theorem [\ref=Komplexifizierungssatz] and as a strictly plurisubharmonic function.

Let M be a real analytic manifold with a contact form η. Then there is a Stein complexification Mc of M and an open neighbourhood Ω of [formula] in [formula] such that the symplectic form ω: = d(etη  +  dt) is the pull-back [formula] of a Kähler form β on Ω.

This is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=symp-d^c-rho] because for a strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula], β: = ddcϱ is a Kähler form with the properties stated in Corollary [\ref=symp-Kahler-form].

Similarly to the equivariant statemant in Corollary [\ref=cor-symp-d^c-rho], an equivariant version of Corollary [\ref=symp-Kahler-form] can be formulated.

Compatibility of reductions

In this section, the compatibility of the complexification with reductions by symmetries is discussed. Roughly speaking, the guiding question is whether the Kählerian reduction of a complexification of a contact manifold can be regarded as the complexification of the contact reduction.

Throughout this section (M,η) is assumed to be a contact manifold on which an extendable Lie group G with finitely many connected components acts properly by contact transformations, i.e., by leaving η invariant. Fix a G-invariant smooth Stein complexification Mc of M such that [formula] holds for some smooth G-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=Komplexifizierungssatz]). Furthermore, assume that there is a globalization [formula] of the local [formula]-action on Mc such that Mc is openly and G-equivariantly embedded in the [formula]-manifold [formula].

Compatibility of moment maps for free actions

Under the assumptions stated at the beginning of the section, there exists a moment map on the contact manifold

[formula]

and a moment map on the Kähler manifold

[formula]

The relation [formula] implies that the Kählerian moment map extends the contact moment map, i.e., [formula]. Cauchy-Riemann geometry enters the picture, because the hypersurface [formula] plays a role as it contains M. This fact makes use of the assumption that the Kählerian moment map is defined by the potential ϱ.

Let (Mc,dcϱ) be a complexification of a contact manifold (M,η) and [formula] be a strictly plurisubharmonic function with M  ⊂  ϱ- 1(0) such that dcϱ extends η in the sense that [formula].

Then possibly after shrinking Mc to a smaller neighbourhood of M, ϱ- 1(0) is a smooth hypersurface in Mc.

The smooth hypersurface [formula] is a strongly pseudoconvex hypersurface.

Since η is nowhere vanishing on M and it is the pull-back of dcϱ, a) follows, because it is immediate that dϱ vanishes nowhere in a neighbourhood of M. The statement b) is just a matter of definitions.

The action of G leaves [formula] invariant and the inclusions

[formula]

are all G-equivariant. Assume that the Lie subgroup L of G acts freely (and properly) on the contact manifold (M,η) and leaves η invariant. In the following proposition it is shown that in the setting of this work, the restriction [formula] can be regarded as the Cauchy-Riemann moment map defined in [\cite=Loose-CR-reduction]. This involves the natural projection [formula] where [formula]. It follows from the definition of the operator dc that the Cauchy-Riemann tangent space can be described by [formula]. Let [formula] be the Cauchy-Riemann bundle of hyperplanes and B denote the (real) line bundle [formula]. Then α can be considered as a B-valued 1-form which defines the Cauchy-Riemann moment map

[formula]

for every [formula].

Let L act freely and properly on M and Mc. For the inclusions

[formula]

the Kählerian moment map

[formula]

has the property that its restriction [formula] is the Cauchy-Riemann moment map for the L-action on [formula], if [formula] is trivialized by the mapping [formula], αp(v)  ↦  (dcϱ)(v).

The line bundle [formula] is trivializable in this situation by the map

[formula]

It is well-defined because if αp(v)  =  αp(w), v - w∈H and (dcϱ)(v - w)  =  0 and therefore (dcϱ)(v)  =  (dcϱ)(v - w)  +  (dcϱ)(w)  =  (dcϱ)(w). Under this trivialization, [formula] with the identification

[formula]

defines the Cauchy-Riemann moment map [formula] by

[formula]

for [formula], where [formula] embeds [formula] into Mc.

Cauchy-Riemann, contact and Kählerian reductions

It will be shown later that the reduction along suitable strata of orbit types can be described by quotients of free actions on certain submanifolds. This is why in this subsection, the case of a freely acting Lie group L is considered. The properties [formula] and [formula] yield the inclusions of the momentum zero levels

[formula]

The inclusion of (μM)- 1(0) and of [formula] in (μMc)- 1(0) will be examined more closely in the following.

Contact and Kählerian reduction

Now the connection between the contact reduction of M and the Kählerian reduction of Mc with respect to a freely and properly acting group L is studied. The situation for the embedding of M in Mc can be summarized in the following diagram:

[formula]

Note that Proposition [\ref=free-proper-case] shows that for this case described here, [formula] is a complex manifold and the function [formula], defined by [formula], is a Kählerian potential. It can be checked that the mapping ι(μM)- 1(0)  /  L is well-defined. In Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho], it is shown that [formula] is the unique 1-form [formula] on [formula] with the property

[formula]

The manifold [formula] with the unique 1-form [formula] such that ([\ref=contact-reduction-property-a]) holds is called the contact reduction of (M,η) as defined in [\cite=Loose-contact-reduction] and [\cite=Willett].

Let the extendable Lie group L with finitely many connected components act freely and properly on M. Then [formula] is the unique 1-form [formula] on [formula] such that

[formula]

The assumptions on the action of L imply that the geometric quotients [formula] and [formula] are manifolds. The function [formula] is definied by [formula]. The desired result follows from the identity

[formula]

because the uniqueness of the contact reduction implies that the reduced contact structure is defined by the 1-form [formula]. Since property ([\ref=contact-reduction-property-a]) holds for the unique 1-form [formula], the 1-form [formula] agrees with [formula] which provides the contact reduction [formula].

The 2-form [formula] on [formula] satisfies

[formula]

It follows from Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho] that

[formula]

Cauchy-Riemann and Kählerian reduction

The following result characterizes both the contact reduction and the Cauchy-Riemann reduction of [formula] as the hypersurface [formula] in the Kählerian reduced space [formula]. The following sketch illustrates the setting:

[formula]

The hypersurface [formula] can be regarded in two ways:

The pull-back of the 1-form [formula] to [formula] gives [formula] the structure of a contact manifold which is isomorphic to the contact reduced space for the L-action on [formula].

The hypersurface [formula] is isomorphic as a Cauchy-Riemann manifold to the Cauchy-Riemann reduction of [formula] with respect to L.

Since [formula] is strictly plurisubharmonic, the form [formula] pulled back to [formula] is a contact form.

As mentioned in Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho] there is a unique contact structure [formula] on the reduced space [formula] such that the identity

[formula]

holds. The commutativity of the diagram above shows that

[formula]

and therefore [formula]. Since the reduced form is the unique 1-form with this property it follows that [formula] gives the contact structure.

Let [formula] be the function on the Kählerian reduction [formula] which is induced by the restriction ϱ|(μMc)- 1(0). This is a strictly plurisubharmonic function, and if 0 is a regular value of ϱ, 0 remains a regular value of [formula]. The map [formula] induces a bijection between [formula] and [formula]. Since the group action on Mc is by holomorphic transformations and leaves the Cauchy-Riemann hypersurface [formula] invariant, the induced action on [formula] is by Cauchy-Riemann diffeomorphisms. The strictly plurisubharmonic function ϱ defines a Cauchy-Riemann submanifold [formula] which is mapped to [formula] by the Cauchy-Riemann map [formula]. Since Loose ([\cite=Loose-CR-reduction], Theorem 1.2) proves that the projection [formula] defines a unique Cauchy-Riemann structure on [formula], [formula] can be regarded as the Cauchy-Riemann reduction of ϱ- 1(0) with respect to L.

In particular, the contact manifold (M,η) is embedded in the (2n - 1)-dimensional contact and Cauchy-Riemann manifold [formula] with the contact form [formula].

The following proposition summarizes the results on the compatibility of the respective reductions.

Let L be an extendable Lie group and L  ×  Mc  →  Mc a free and proper action that extends L  ×  M  →  M and leaves [formula] invariant. Then there is the following commutative diagram

[formula]

of smooth maps.

The momentum zero levels (μM)- 1(0), [formula] and (μMc)- 1(0) are smooth because the L-orbits have constant dimensions. Since the three actions of L are proper and free, the three quotients

[formula]

are differentiable manifolds and the natural projections

[formula]

are differentiable maps as well as the induced inclusions

[formula]

Compatibility of reduced strata

The results of the Subsections [\ref=Compatibility_of_moment_maps_for_free_actions] and [\ref=CR-contact-Kahler-red] are now applied to general proper actions on contact manifolds (M,η) and their complexifications Mc. Let H be a compact subgroup of G. The isotropy types of H define a stratification of M ([\cite=Sjamaar]). The stratum [formula] of points in Mc with isotropy type H is G-invariant and contains the complex submanifold McH  =  {x∈Mc|Gx  =  H}. Then

[formula]

where [formula] acts freely ([\cite=Greb-Heinzner], [\cite=Sjamaar]). Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho] implies that it is a Kähler manifold. To abbreviate, define

[formula]

and similarly, in the contact case,

[formula]

For future reference, the necessary facts for the Kählerian reduction along the strata M(Mc(H)) are summarized here; they are well known ( [\cite=HHL], [\cite=Lerman-Willett], [\cite=Willett], [\cite=Sjamaar]).

Let x0∈(μMc)- 1(0) and let V be the orthogonal complement to the tangent space of the local [formula]-orbit through x0 with respect to the Kählerian metric. The momentum zero level along the stratum (Mc)(H), i.e., M(Mc(H)), is locally and equivariantly isomorphic to G  ×  HVH where VH  =  {v∈V|h  ·  v  =  vh∈H}. The Kählerian reduced space [formula] is locally homeomorphic to VH ([\cite=Sjamaar]).

The Kempf-Ness reduced space [formula] can be stratified into the strata [formula] which inherit a natural symplectic and complex structure.

Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho] can be applied to the free action of [formula] on M(MH), where NG(H) is the normalizer of H in G. In the case of a contact manifold (M,η) on which G acts in a proper fashion by contact transformations, recall the following facts ([\cite=Willett], [\cite=Lerman-Willett]):

The stratum MH  =  {m∈M|Gm  =  H} is a contact manifold and for the stratum M(H)  =  {m∈M|GmH} the quotients

[formula]

are naturally isomorphic manifolds, where [formula] acts freely and properly.

The manifold [formula] carries a uniquely induced contact form [formula] with the property

[formula]

where [formula] and πM(MH) is the projection of M(MH) to [formula]

Note that these facts treat every stratum independently and one obtains for each stratum M(M(H)) of (μM)- 1(0) a reduced contact space; there is no condition that links the various contact structures.

If x0∈(μM)- 1(0) and H  =  Gx0 then (Mc)H complexifies MH.

Let V be the complex vector subspace in Tx0Mc, which is the complement with respect to the Kählerian metric of the local [formula]-orbit through x0. There is a G-invariant neighbourhood U(x0) of x0 which is openly and G-equivariantly embedded in the complex [formula]-manifold [formula] ([\cite=Heinzner-Kurtdere], [\cite=Kurtdere]). Since x0∈(μM)- 1(0)  ⊂  (μMc)- 1(0), [formula] and it is possible to assume in addition that [formula], where W  ⊂  Tx0M is an H-invariant subspace such that [formula] embeds openly in G  ×  HW. If [formula], it follows that for [formula]. Finally [formula] and [formula] are open embeddings. Since [formula] can be regarded as the complexification of G  ×  HW〈H〉, this proves the claim.

The set (Mc)H  =  {z∈Mc|Gz  =  H} is a complex submanifold of Mc ([\cite=Sjamaar]). The normalizer NG(H) of H in G acts naturally on (Mc)H. The induced action of [formula] on (Mc)H is free. If x0∈(μM)- 1(0) and H  =  Gx0, it follows that [formula] is embedded in a Kählerian submanifold of Mc. The 1-form [formula] is the contact 1-form on MH and [formula] is the Kählerian form on Mc. Furthermore, [formula] and

[formula]

Thus the contact manifold [formula] is NG(H)-equivariantly embedded in the Kähler manifold ((Mc)H, - ddcϱ|(Mc)H), where [formula] is a strictly plurisubharmonic and NG(H)-invariant function. The following result establishes the compatibility of the extensions with reductions.

Let [formula] be the function defined by [formula]. Let x0∈(μM)- 1(0) and H  =  Gx0 be the isotropy group. The contact manifold [formula] embeds in the Kählerian manifold [formula] such that [formula] The reduced spaces

[formula]

where [formula], are related by the property that for the induced embedding [formula]

[formula]

Since [formula] acts freely on (Mc)H, Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho] applies. It follows that the contact moment map [formula] and the Kählerian moment map [formula] define smooth momentum zero levels M(MH) and M(McH), because L acts freely. For the same reason [formula] and [formula] are smooth, and the restriction of ϱ|M(McH) defines a strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that the embedding [formula] satisfies [formula]

In the same way, the strata M(H) and (Mc)(H) are compatible. For every closed subgroup H of G the strata [formula] of [formula] and [formula] of [formula] are compatible by the function [formula] induced by the restriction ϱ|(μMc)- 1(0) in the following sense:

The embedding [formula] induces embeddings

[formula]

such that a contact manifold [formula] embeds in [formula] and has the property

[formula]

where [formula] is the reduced contact form on [formula].

The quotients [formula] and [formula] are naturally diffeomorphic ([\cite=Willett]). Similarly [formula] and [formula] are naturally diffeomorphic. Proposition [\ref=complex-contact-stratum] and the commutativity of the diagram

[formula]

prove the claim.

As a summary, the geometry of the contact, Cauchy-Riemann and Kählerian reductions can be described as follows.

Let G be an extendable Lie group and (M,η) a proper G-contact manifold. There is an equivariant Stein complexification Mc with a smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function [formula] such that dcϱ extends η. Let the fuction [formula] be defined by [formula]. Let H  <  G be a compact subgroup and [formula]. Then for every stratum (Mc)(H), the 1-form [formula]

provides the Kählerian reduction of (Mc)(H),

pulled-back to [formula] is equivalent to the contact and the Cauchy-Riemann reduction of [formula]

and pulled back to [formula] provides the contact reduction of M(H).

The compatibility of the reductions with the Kählerian reduction is shown in Proposition [\ref=compatibility-Kahler]. The Cauchy-Riemann reduction is carried out in Proposition [\ref=contact-isomorphic] and the contact reduction by Proposition [\ref=prop-contact-reduction-varrho]. These results are applied to the stratifications described in Proposition [\ref=complex-contact-stratum] and Proposition [\ref=complex-contact-stratum-red].

Piecewise contact structures

For a proper action G  ×  M  →  M on a contact manifold (M,η) by contact transformations [formula] is stratified into smooth contact manifolds [formula] ([\cite=Willett], [\cite=Lerman-Willett]). The respective contact structures are induced by the contact reductions. However, these contact structures are treated separately; the transition between two strata is not worked out in [\cite=Willett] and [\cite=Lerman-Willett]. In the symplectic setting, a Poisson structure can be defined which allows one to discuss the compatibility of the various strata. As a suitable tool in the case of contact manifolds, the following definition of a piecewise contact structure is suggested here to state a compatibility condition from stratum to stratum.

Theorem [\ref=Komplexifizierungssatz] shows that a smooth contact manifold is a piecewise contact manifold which consists of one stratum only.

In the case of an extendable Lie group ([\cite=Heinzner-Kurtdere], [\cite=Kurtdere]) show that [formula] enherits from Mc the structure of a complex space in a natural way on which [formula] is a strictly plurisubharomonic function. Then [formula] stratifies the reduced space [formula] and Proposition [\ref=complex-contact-stratum-red] can now also be stated as follows:

Let G be an extendable Lie group which acts properly on a contact manifold (M,η) by contact transformations. Then there is a canonically defined structure of a piecewise contact manifold on the quotient [formula]. [formula]
