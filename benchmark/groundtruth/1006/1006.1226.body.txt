Abstract. Recently, Kitaev and Remmel posed a conjecture concerning the generating function for the number of unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets with respect to number of elements and number of minimal elements. In this paper, we present a combinatorial proof of this conjecture.

Key words: (2 + 2)-free poset, minimal element.

Introduction

A poset is said to be (2 + 2)-free if it does not contain an induced subposet that is isomorphic to 2 + 2, the union of two disjoint 2-element chains. In a poset, let D(x) be the set of predecessors of an element x (the strict down-set of x). Formally, D(x) = {y:y < x}. A poset P is (2 + 2)-free if and only if its sets of predecessors, D(P) = {D(x):x∈P} can be written as

[formula]

where [formula], see [\cite=Bog] [\cite=melon]. In such context, we say that x∈P has level i if D(x) = Di. An element x is said to be a minimal element if x has level 0.

Let pn be the number of unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets on n elements. EI-Zahar [\cite=zahar] and Khamis [\cite=khamis] used a recursive description of (2 + 2)-free posets to derive a pair of functional equations that define the generating function for the number pn. But they did not solve these equations. Recently, using functional equations and the Kernel method, Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon] showed that the generating function for the number pn of unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets on n elements is given by

[formula]

Note that throughout this paper, the empty product as usual is taken to be 1. In fact, they studied a more general function of unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets according to number of elements, number of levels and level of minimum maximal elements. Zagier [\cite=zag] proved that Formula ([\ref=pt]) is also the generating function for certain involutions introduced by Stoimenow [\cite=Stoi].

Given a sequence of integers [formula], we say that the sequence x has an ascent at position i if xi < xi + 1. The number of ascents of x is denoted by asc(x). A sequence [formula] is said to be an ascent sequence of length n if it satisfies x1 = 0 and [formula] for all 2  ≤  i  ≤  n. Ascent sequences were introduce by Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon] to unify three combinatorial structures. Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon] constructed bijections between unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets and ascent sequences, between ascent sequences and permutations avoiding a certain pattern, between unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets and a class of involutions introduced by Stoimenow [\cite=Stoi].

Recently, Kitaev and Remmel [\cite=Kitaev] extended the work of Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon]. They found generating function for unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets when four statistics are taken into account, one of which is the number of minimal elements in a poset. The key strategy used by Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon] and Kitaev and Remmel [\cite=Kitaev] is to translate statistics on (2 + 2)-free posets to statistics on ascent sequences using the bijection between unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets and ascent sequences given by Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon]. Let pn,k be the number of (2 + 2)-free posets on n elements with k minimal elements, with the assumption p0,0 = 1. Under the bijection between unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets and ascent sequences, the number of unlabeled (2 + 2)-free posets on n elements with k minimal elements is equal to that of ascent sequences of length n with k zeros. Kitaev and Remmel [\cite=Kitaev] derived that the generating function for the number pn,k is given by

[formula]

by counting ascent sequences with respect to length and number of zeros. Moreover, they conjectured the function P(t,z) can be written in a simpler form.

[formula]

The objective of this paper is to give a combinatorial proof of Conjecture [\ref=conjecture]. In order to prove the conjecture, we need two more combinatorial structures: upper triangular matrices with non-negative integer entries such that all rows and columns contain at least one non-zero entry, which was introduced by Dukes and Parviainen [\cite=Duck], and upper triangular (0,1)-matrices in which all columns contain at least one non-zero entry.

Let An be the collection of upper triangular matrices with non-negative integer entries which sum to n. A (0,1)-matrix is a matrix in which each entry is either 0 or 1. Let Mn be the set of (0,1)-matrices in An in which all columns contain at least one non-zero entry. Denote by In the set of matrices in An in which all rows and columns contain at least one non-zero entry. Given a matrix A, denoted by Ai,j the entry in row i and column j. Let dim(A) be the number of rows in the matrix A. The sum of all entries in row i is called the row sum of row i, denoted by rsumi(A). The column sum of column i, denoted by csumi(A), can be defined similarly. A row is said to be zero if its row sum is zero.

Let A be a matrix in Mn, define min i(A) to be the least value of j such Aj,i is non-zero. A column i of A is said to be improper if it satisfies one of the following two cases: (1) csumi(A)  ≥  2; (2) for 1 < i  ≤  dim(A), we have csumi(A) = 1, rsumi(A) = 0, and min i(A) < mini - 1(A). Otherwise, column i is said to be proper. The matrix A is said to be improper if there is at least one improper column in A; otherwise, the matrix A is said to be proper. Given an improper matrix A∈Mn, define index(A) to be the largest value i such that column i is improper. Denote by n the set of proper matrices in Mn.

Consider the following matrix A∈M8:

[formula]

We have dim(A) = 6, min 1(A) = 1, min 2(A) = 2, min 3(A) = 1, min 4(A) = 2, min 5(A) = 2, min 6(A) = 1. There are two improper columns, that is, columns 3 and 6. Hence, we have index(A) = 6.

Denote by n,k the set of matrices A∈n with rsum1(A) = k and In,k the set of matrices A∈In with rsum1(A) = k. Dukes and Parviainen [\cite=Duck] constructed a recursive bijection between the set In and the set of ascent sequences of length n. Under their bijection, they showed that the number of upper triangular matrices A∈In with rsum1(A) = k is equal to the number of ascent sequences of length n with k zeros, which implies that the cardinality of In,k is also given by pn,k. In this paper, we will prove Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] by showing that the generating function for the number of matrices in In,k is given by the right-hand side of Formula ([\ref=identity]).

In Section 2, we present a parity reversing and weight preserving involution on the set [formula]. In Section 3, we prove that the right-hand side of Formula ([\ref=identity]) is the generating function for the number of matrices in n,k. Moreover, we show that there is a bijection between the set n,k and the set In,k in answer to Conjecture [\ref=conjecture].

A parity reversing and weight preserving involution

In this section, we will construct a parity reversing and weight preserving involution on the set [formula]. Before constructing the involution, we need some definitions.

Given a matrix A∈Mn, the weight of the matrix A is assigned by zrsum1(A). Given a subset S of the set n, the weight of S, denoted by W(S), is the sum of the weights of all matrices in S. We define the parity of the matrix A to be the parity of the number n - dim(A). Denote by n (resp. n ) the set of matrices in Mn whose parity are even (resp. odd).

There is a parity reversing and weight preserving involution Φ on the set [formula]. Furthermore, we have

[formula]

Proof. Given a matrix [formula], suppose that index(A) = i. We now have two cases. (1) We have csumi(A)  ≥  2. (2) We have 1 < i  ≤  dim(A), csumi(A) = 1, rsumi(A) = 0, and min i(A) < mini - 1(A).

For Case (1), we obtain a new matrix Φ(A) from the matrix A in the following way. In A, replace the entry in row min i(A) of column i with zero. Then, insert a new zero row between row i and row i + 1 and insert a new column between column i and i + 1. Let the new column be filled with all zeros except that the entry in row min i(A) is filled with 1. In this case, we have [formula] with index(Φ(A)) = i + 1, dim(Φ(A)) = dim(A) + 1 and rsum1(Φ(A)) = rsum1(A).

For Case (2), we may obtain a new matrix Φ(A) by reversing the construction for Case (1) as follows. In A, replace the entry in row min i(A) of column i - 1 with 1. Then remove column i and row i. In this case, we have [formula] with index(Φ(A)) = i - 1, dim(Φ(A)) = dim(A) - 1 and rsum1(Φ(A)) = rsum1(A).

In both cases, the map Φ reverse the parities and preserve the the weights of the matrices. Hence, we obtain a desired parity reversing and weight preserving involution on the set [formula]. Note that if a matrix A∈Mn is proper, then there is exactly one 1 in each column. Hence for each A∈n, the parity of A is even. By applying the involution, we can deduce that

[formula]

Consider the following two matrices in M6:

[formula]

For matrix A, we have index(A) = 3. Thus we have

[formula]

where the new inserted row and column are illustrated in bold.

For matrix B, we have index(B) = 4. Thus we have

[formula]

In fact, we have Φ(A) = B and Φ(B) = A.

Proof of Conjecture [\ref=conjecture]

In this section, we will show that the right-hand side of Formula [\ref=identity] is the generating function for the number of matrices in n,k. Furthermore, we prove that there is a bijection between the set n,k and the set In,k, which implies Conjecture [\ref=conjecture].

Let

[formula]

With the assumption that the empty product is as usual taken to be 1, we have

[formula]

Define An(z) to be the coefficient of tn in A(t,z) for n  ≥  1, that is

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

where the second summation is over all compositions [formula] such that nj  ≥  1 for [formula].

For n  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Proof. Let [formula] be the set of matrices in Mn with d columns in which the column sum of column j is equal to nj for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  d. In order to get a matrix [formula], we should choose nj places in column j form j places to arrange 1's for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  d. we have two cases. (1) If A1,j = 0, then we have [formula] ways to arrange 1's in column j. (2) If A1,j = 1, then we have [formula] ways to arrange the remaining 1's in column j. In the former case, column j contributes 1 to the weight of A. While in the latter case, column j contributes z to the weight of A. Altogether, column j contributes [formula] to the weight of [formula], which implies that

[formula]

It is clear that the parity of each matrix in [formula] is the parity of the number n - d. When d ranges from 1 to n and [formula] range over all compositions [formula] such that nj  ≥  1 for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  d, we get the desired result.

Denote by an,k the cardinality of the set n,k. Assume that a(0,0) = 1.

We have

[formula]

Proof. Combining Theorem [\ref=involution] and Lemma [\ref=A_n(z)], we deduce that An(z) = W(n) for n  ≥  1. Note that [formula] for n  ≥  1. Hence we have

[formula]

which implies the desired result.

From Theorem [\ref=A(t] [\ref=z)], in order to prove Conjecture [\ref=conjecture], it suffices to prove that an,k = pn,k. In a matrix A, the operation of adding column i to column j is defined by increasing Ak,j by Ak,i for each [formula]. Note that a matrix A∈Mn is proper if and only if it satisfies

each column has exactly one 1;

if rsumi(A) = 0, then we have min i(A)  ≥   min i - 1(A) for 2  ≤  i  ≤  dim(A).

This observation will be essential in the construction of the bijection between the set n,k and the set In,k.

There is a bijection between the set n,k and the set In,k.

Proof. Let A be a matrix in the n,k, we can construct a matrix A' in In,k. If there is no zero rows in A, then we do nothing for A and let A' = A. In this case, the resulting matrix A' is contained in In,k. Otherwise, we can construct a new upper triangular matrix A' by the following removal algorithm.

Find the least value i such that row i is a zero row. Then we obtain a new upper triangular matrix by adding column i to column i - 1 and remove column i and row i.

Repeat the above procedure for the resulting matrix until there is no zero row in the resulting matrix.

Clearly, the obtained matrix A' is a matrix in In. Since the algorithm preserves the sums of entries in each non-zero rows of A, we have rsum1(A') = rsum1(A). Hence, the resulting matrix A' is in In,k.

Conversely, we can construct a matrix in n,k from a matrix in In,k. Let B be a matrix in the In,k. If the sum of entries in each column is equal to 1, then we do nothing for B and let B' = B. Otherwise, we can construct a new upper triangular matrix B' by the following addition algorithm.

Find the largest value i such that csumi(B)  ≥  2. Then we obtain a new upper triangular matrix by decreasing the entry in row max i(B) of column i by 1, where max i(B) is defined to be the largest value j such that Bj,i is non-zero. Since B is upper triangular, we have max i(B)  ≤  i.

Insert one column between column i and column i + 1 and one zero row between row i and row i + 1 such that the new inserted column is filled with all zeros except that the entry on row max i(B) is filled with 1.

Repeat the above procedure for the resulting matrix until there is no column whose column sum is lager than 1.

Clearly, the obtained matrix B' is a matrix in Mn. From the construction of the above algorithm we know that the column sum of each column in B' is equal to 1. Furthermore, if row j is a zero row, then we must have min j(B')  ≥   min j - 1(B'). Thus, the resulting matrix B' is proper. Since the algorithm preserves the sums of entries in each non-zero row of B, we have rsum1(B') = rsum1(B). Hence, the resulting matrix B' is in n,k. This completes the proof.

Consider a matrix A∈6,3. By applying the removal algorithm, we get

[formula]

where the removed rows and columns are illustrated in bold at each step of the removal algorithm. Conversely, given A'∈I6,3, by applying addition algorithm, we can get A∈6,3, where the inserted new rows and columns are illustrated in bold at each step of the addition algorithm.

Combining Theorems [\ref=involution], [\ref=A(t] [\ref=z)] and [\ref=bijection], we obtain a combinatorial proof of Conjecture [\ref=conjecture]. Note that specializing z = 1 implies a combinatorial proof of Formula ([\ref=pt]), which was proved by Bousquet-Mélou et al. [\cite=melon] by using functional equations and the Kernel method.
