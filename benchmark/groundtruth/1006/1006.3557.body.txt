Gisin's Theorem for Arbitrary Dimensional Multipartite States

Introduction

One of the most remarkable aspects of quantum theory is the incompatibility of quantum non-locality with local-realistic theories. The Bell inequalities [\cite=bell] impose constraints on the correlations between measurement outcomes on two separated systems, giving rise to the limits for what can be described within the framework of any local hidden variable theory. They are of great importance for understanding the conceptual foundations of quantum theory as well as for investigating quantum entanglement, as Bell inequalities can be violated by quantum entangled states. One of the most important Bell inequalities is the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality [\cite=clauser] for two-qubit systems. It is then generalized to the N-qubit case, known as the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality [\cite=mermin]. A set of multipartite Bell inequalities has been elegantly derived in terms of two dichotomic observables per site [\cite=wwzb], which includes the MABK inequality as a special case [\cite=10] and can detect some entangled states that the MABK inequality fails to detect. In [\cite=chen] another family of Bell inequalities for N-qubit systems has been introduced, which is maximally violated by all the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.

In fact, Gisin presented a theorem in 1991. It says that any pure entangled two-qubit states violate the CHSH inequality [\cite=gisin]. Namely the CHSH inequality is both sufficient and necessary for separability of two-qubit states. Soon after, Gisin and Peres provided an elegant proof of this theorem for the case of pure two-qudit systems [\cite=gisinperes]. In [\cite=jingling] Chen et al. showed that all pure entangled three-qubit states violate a Bell inequality. Nevertheless generally it still remains open whether the Gisin's theorem can be generalized to the N-qudit case or not.

The Bell inequalities are also useful in verifying the security of quantum key distribution protocols [\cite=security]. There is a simple relation between nonlocality and distillability: if any two-qubit [\cite=ho] or three-qubit [\cite=loo] pure or mixed state violates a specific Bell inequality, then the state must be distillable. In [\cite=16] Dür has shown that for the case N  ≥  8, there exist N-qubit bound entangled (not distillable) states which violate some Bell inequalities. However, Acn has demonstrated that for all states violating the inequality, there exists at least one kind of bipartite decomposition of the system such that pure entangled state can be distilled [\cite=18] [\cite=19]. But generally it is still an open problem if violation of a Bell inequality already implies distillability.

In this paper, we present a set of Bell inequalities which can be shown to be both sufficient and necessary for separability of general pure multipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions, thus proving the Gisin's theorem generally. We also show that pure entangled states can be distilled from quantum mixed states that violate one of these Bell inequalities.

Bell Inequalities for Bipartite Quantum Systems

For two-qubit quantum systems, the Bell operators are defined by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] are real unit vectors satisfying [formula], i,j = 1,2, σx,y,zA / B are Pauli matrices. The CHSH inequality says that if there exist local hidden variable models to describe the system, the inequality

[formula]

must hold.

In stead of two-qubit (2  ×  2) system, we first consider general N  ×  M bipartite quantum systems in vector space [formula] with dimensions [formula] and [formula] respectively. We aim to find Bell inequalities like ([\ref=b22]) such that any quantum entangled states would violate a Bell inequality.

Let LAα and LBβ be the generators of special unitary groups SO(M) and SO(N) respectively. The M(M - 1) / 2 generators LAα are given by {|j〉〈k| - |k〉〈j|}, 1  ≤  j  <  k  ≤  M, where |i〉, i = 1,...,M, are the usual orthonormal basis of [formula]. LBβ are similarly defined. The matrix operators Lα (resp. Lβ) have M - 2 (resp. N - 2) rows and M - 2 (resp. N - 2) columns that are identically zero. We define the operators Aαi (resp. Bβj) from Lα (resp. Lβ) by replacing the four entries on the positions of the nonzero 2 rows and 2 columns of Lα (resp. Lβ) with the corresponding four entries of the matrix [formula] (resp. [formula]), and keeping the other entries of Aαi (resp. Bβj) zero. We define the Bell operators to be

[formula]

where Ãαi = LαAαiL†α, βj = LβBβjL†β, and i,j = 1,2.

Theorem 1: Any bipartite pure quantum state is entangled if and only if at least one of the following Bell inequalities is violated,

[formula]

where [formula], [formula].

Proof: Assume that the state |ψ〉 violates one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=b]), i.e. there exist α0 and β0 such that |〈α0β0〉| > 2. Then equivalently one has that the state [formula] violates the CHSH inequality in ([\ref=b22]). As the local operation [formula] does not change the separability of a state, |ψ〉 must be entangled.

Now assume that [formula] is an entangled state. We prove that at least one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=b]) is violated. Set ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ|. By projecting |ψ〉 onto 2  ×  2 subsystems [\cite=ou], we get the following pure states:

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]. Here ραβ are pure states with rank one. As the matrix [formula] has MN - 4 rows and MN - 4 columns that are identically zero, there are at most [formula] nonzero elements in the matrix ραβ. The states ραβ are called "two-qubit" states in this sense.

The concurrence of |ψ〉 is defined by [formula] with ρA = TrB(ρ) the reduced density matrix of ρ by tracing over the subsystem B [\cite=con]. A pure quantum state |ψ〉 can be generally expressed as [formula], in the computational basis |i〉 and |j〉 of [formula] and [formula] respectively, i = 1,...,M and j  =  1,...,N. Therefore the concurrence can be expressed as

[formula]

where ραβ are defined in ([\ref=qus]). Since we have assumed that |ψ〉 is an entangled quantum state, C(|ψ〉) must be not zero, i.e. at least one of the ραβ, say ρα0β0, has non-zero concurrence, C(ρα0β0) > 0. As we have discussed above, ρα0β0 is actually a "two-qubit" quantum pure state. It has been shown in [\cite=gisin] [\cite=gisinperes] that an entangled two-qubit pure state must violate the Bell inequality ([\ref=b22]). Therefore the inequality |〈α0β0〉|  ≤  2 is violated.

Bell Inequalities for Multipartite Quantum Systems

We now generalize the results above to multipartite quantum systems. For convenience we consider that all the subsystems have the same dimensions. However, as can be seen from the following, our discussions also apply to multipartite quantum systems with different dimensions.

Let H denote a d-dimensional vector space with basis |i〉, i = 1,2,...,d. An L-partite pure state in [formula] is generally of the form,

[formula]

Let α and α' (resp.β and β') be subsets of the subindices of a, associated to the same sub-vector spaces but with different summing indices. α (or α') and β (or β') span the whole space of the given sub-indix of a. A possible combinations of the indices of α and β can be equivalently understood as a kind of bipartite decomposition of the L subsystems, say part A and part B, containing m and n = L - m subsystems respectively.

For a given bipartite decomposition, we can use the analysis similar to the bipartite case. Let LAα and LBβ be the generators of special unitary groups SO(dm) and SO(dn). By projecting |Ψ〉 onto 2  ×  2 subsystems we have the "two-qubit" pure states:

[formula]

where [formula], p labels the bipartite decompositions of the L subsystems.

For every pure state ρpαβ we define the corresponding Bell operators

[formula]

where Ãαi = LAαAαi(LAα)† and βj = LBβBβj(LBβ)† are the Hermitian operators similarly defined as in ([\ref=bellop]).

Theorem 2: Any multipartite pure quantum state is entangled if and only if at least one of the following inequalities is violated,

[formula]

Proof: Obviously, multipartite quantum states that violate any one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=bm]) must be entangled.

We now prove that, for any entangled multipartite pure quantum state, at least one of the inequalities in ([\ref=bm]) is violated. The concurrence of |Ψ〉 is given by [\cite=anote]

[formula]

where K = d  /  2m(d  -  1), m = 2L - 1 - 1, [formula] stands for the summation over all possible combinations of the indices of α and β. ([\ref=def]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

where ρpαβ are defined in ([\ref=quss]). As |Ψ〉 is an entangled state, C(|Ψ〉) must be not zero, i.e. at least one of ρpαβ, say ρp0α0β0, has non-zero concurrence. As we have discussed above, ρp0α0β0 is actually a two-qubit quantum pure state. An entangled two-qubit quantum pure state must violate the Bell inequality ([\ref=b22]).

As an example, we consider three-qubit systems. In [\cite=acin], Acin etc. have verified that any pure three-qubit state |Ψ〉 can be uniquely written as

[formula]

where λi  ≥  0, 0  ≤  ψ  ≤  π, [formula]. From straightforward computation one has

[formula]

We give a detailed analysis on that an entangled pure three-qubit state, i.e. at least one of the terms in the right hand side of ([\ref=3qc]) is non-zero, must violate one of the inequalities in ([\ref=bm]).

Case 1: If λ0λ2  ≠  0, the corresponding operator [formula] and

[formula]

Choose the Bell operator in ([\ref=q]) to be the one with respect to the bipartite decomposition of the first two qubits and the last one,

[formula]

where Ã2k = LA2A2k(LA2)†, 1l = LB1B1l(LB1)†, and [formula], [formula], k,l = 1,2, we have the maximal violation of the inequality ([\ref=bm]), [formula].

Case 2: If |eiψλ1λ4  -  λ2λ3|  ≠  0, the corresponding operator [formula]. The matrix ρ12|361 has only nonzero entries at the right down corner with the form,

[formula]

The Bell operator in ([\ref=q]) has the form,

[formula]

where Ã6k = LA6A6k(LA6)†, 1l = LB1B1l(LB1)†, and [formula], [formula], k,l = 1,2. The corresponding maximal violation is given by [formula], which is obviously strictly larger than 2. Other cases can be discussed similarly.

Bell Inequalities and Distillation

A bipartite state ρ is called distillable, iff maximally entangled bipartite pure states, e.g. [formula], can be created from a number of identical copies of the state ρ by means of local operations and classical communication. We call a multipartite state distillable, if and only if there exists at least one bipartite decomposition of the system such that pure entangled states can be distilled. It has been shown that all quantum entangled pure states are distillable. However it is a challenge to give an operational criterion of distillability for general mixed states. In [\cite=ou] a sufficient condition of distillability has been presented. Our inequalities ([\ref=bm]) are both sufficient and necessary for separability of pure states, but generally not for separability of mixed ones. However surprisingly ([\ref=bm]) can be served as criterion for distillability.

Theorem 3: Any bipartite quantum state ρ that violates any one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=b]), i.e. Tr{Bαβρ} > 2, is always distillable. And if a multipartite quantum state ρ violates one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=bm]), i.e. ρ satisfies Tr{Bpαβρ} > 2, then bipartite maximally entangled pure states can be distilled from the copies of ρ.

Proof: It was shown in [\cite=horo] that a density matrix ρ is distillable iff there are some projectors P, Q that map high dimensional spaces to two-dimensional ones such that the state [formula] is entangled for some s copies. Thus if any one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=b]) is violated, there exists a submatrix ραβ, like ([\ref=qus]), that has nonzero concurrence. For generally given operator Lα = |i〉〈j| - |j〉〈i|, Lβ = |k〉〈l| - |l〉〈k|, the operators P, Q can be explicitly given by P = ALα, Q = BLβ, where A = |0A〉〈i| + |1A〉〈j|, B = |0B〉〈k| + |1B〉〈l|, |0A / B〉 and |1A / B〉 are the orthonormal bases of a two dimensional vector space. [formula] maps state ρ to a two-qubit one that has the same nonzero concurrence as ραβ. Since any entangled two-qubit state is distillable, ρ is distillable. The multipartite case can be discussed similarly.

Remark It has been shown that PPT (positive partial transposition) entangled quantum states are not distillable [\cite=ppt]. Therefore PPT quantum states should never violate the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=b]) or ([\ref=bm]). This fact can be seen from the following. A density matrix ρ is called PPT if the partial transposition of ρ with respect to any subsystem(s) is still positive. Let ρTB denote the partial transposition with respect to the subsystem B. Assume that there is a PPT state ρ violating one of the Bell inequalities in ([\ref=bm]), say Tr{Bp0α0β0ρ} > 2. This can be equivalently understood as that there exists two-qubit state ρp0α0β0 in the form of ([\ref=quss]) such that Tr{Bp0α0β0ρp0α0β0} > 2, where [formula]. One the other hand, by using the PPT property of ρ, we have:

[formula]

As both LAα0 and LBβ0 are projectors to two-dimensional subspaces, ρp0α0β0 can be considered as a 2  ×  2 state. While a 2  ×  2 PPT state ρα0β0 must be separable [\cite=ho96], it contradicts with Tr{Bp0α0β0ρp0α0β0} > 2.

Conclusions and Remarks

In conclusion, we have derived a series of new Bell inequalities for both bipartite and multipartite quantum states by projecting the whole quantum systems to "two-qubit" subsystems. We show that quantum states that violating any one of these Bell inequalities are entangled. On the other hand, we have proved that any entangled pure quantum states must violate at least one of these Bell inequalities. Thus the Gisin theorem for general multipartite quantum systems has been proved. We have also shown that quantum states that violate the Bell inequalities must be distillable, which helps on measurable determination of quantum entanglement experimentally.
