Consistent Asymptotic Expansion of Mott's Solution for Oxide Growth

Introduction

From the late 1930s to the late 1940s, N.F. Mott considered [\cite=Mott1939a] [\cite=Mott1940a] [\cite=Mott1947a] the implications of experimental results [\cite=Tammann1920] for oxide growth. (For more of a review, see Ref [\cite=Cabrera1949].) Under certain conditions (particularly high temperature), many metals develop [\cite=Tammann1920] a layer of oxide at a parabolic rate on surfaces exposed to gas containing oxygen, according to

[formula]

where L is the thickness of the oxide, t is time, and A is a constant. The rate of growth is thus

[formula]

This result may be thought of as representing the long-time asymptotic limit. For specificity, we assume that the metal M fills x < 0, that oxide MO fills 0 < x < L, and that oxygen gas O fills L < x. This means we employ a moving coordinate system where x = 0 represents the M/MO interface, and x = L(t) represents the MO/O interface.

A field and fluxes that vary as t- 1 / 2 are expected on the basis of a gradient of concentration, with the values of the carrier concentrations pinned by the two surfaces and the length L determining the gradient.[\cite=Tammann1920] That is, dL / dt  ~  1 / L gives a parabolic law. Wagner obtained a parabolic growth law using the Planck-Nernst equations and some additional assumptions.[\cite=Wagner1966] Mott obtained a parabolic growth law using a more complete argument[\cite=Mott1940a] that invokes the Planck-Nernst equations, Gauss's Law, and (implicitly) the continuity equations. In this case one can think of the electrochemical potentials pinned by the two surfaces and L determining the gradient, which then yields the parabolic law.

For electron and ion number currents (ja,jb) and ion valence Z = 1, Mott assumed that the total current J = e(jb - ja) in the oxide is zero, so

[formula]

Since oxide grows when metal ions reach the oxide/gas interface, the growth rate is

[formula]

where Ω is the volume per metal ion in the newly formed oxide. Comparison with ([\ref=eq:GrowthRate]) immediately shows that

[formula]

for the asymptotic behavior of the ion fluxes. By the Planck-Nernst equations, the electric field E and the ion density gradients (∂xna,∂xnb) also have the same behavior. Moreover, the quantities (ja,jb,E,∂xna,∂xnb) are all uniform throughout the oxide.

We assume that the metal and the gas are neutral, so by Gauss's Law the surface charges (Σ(0),Σ(L)) and the electric fields (E(0),E(L)) are related by

[formula]

Moreover, by continuity the assumption that there is charge and current only within the oxide leads to the conditions

[formula]

This model immediately poses the questions of whether Mott's solution is self-consistent, and whether it is the beginning of an asymptotic series in powers of t- 1 / 2. To answer self-consistency, note that the uniform but decreasing-with-time E  ~  t- 1 / 2 leads to no bulk charge and to interfaces with equal and opposite charge, so they behave like a capacitor. Since E decreases with time, so must the charge on the capacitor. However, the model assumes zero current. Hence Mott's solution is not self-consistent.

Nevertheless we will show, in response to the question about asymptopia, that each of the continuous variables can be expanded in an asymptotic series in t- n / 2, where Mott's solution corresponds to n = 1, and that non-zero current J appears at order n = 3. We will also show that all of the continuous variables can depend upon position. This means that the bulk can develop a local and total charge density, with the surfaces not having equal and opposite charges, so that the capacitor model holds only to lowest order. It is already known that steady non-equilibrium current flow can cause local charge densities in the bulk.[\cite=Saslow1996a] [\cite=Yang1998a]

The fact that an expansion can be made of jb in powers of t- 1 / 2 leads to

[formula]

so that

[formula]

to higher accuracy than given by the pure parabolic law. This prediction can be subjected to experimental study. In practice, we must assume that

[formula]

because ln t is of order unity. We have not found data of a high enough precision to verify this ln t correction.

Section II gives the five fundamental equations for the five continuous variables (two continuity equations, Gauss's Law, and two Planck-Nernst equations), and indicates the expansion in powers of t- 1 / 2. (The fact that it is such an expansion relates to the leading order term and the fact that the Planck-Nernst equation is a nonlinear function of the density.) Section III gives the n = 1 solution, which has two interface-reaction-rate-determined integration constants: both A and a constant-in-space density not included in the Mott solution. Section IV presents the results of the n = 2 solution that gives the first correction to Mott's solution, and shows that there is a non-zero bulk charge density and a corresponding spatial variation to the field. There are four interface-reaction-rate-determined integration constants for n = 2. All higher-order solutions involve four interface-reaction-rate-determined integration constants. Section V considers the oxide thickness growth rate. Section VI provides a summary and conclusions. The Appendices explicitly give the n = 2 and n = 3 solutions.

On Two-Component Transport

Let the subscripts a and b denote electrons and metal ions respectively. Let n0 and n0 / Z be the uniform equilibrium concentration of electrons and metal ions respectively, (na,nb) be their additional concentrations, (νa,νb) be their mobilities, (Da,Db) be their diffusion coefficients, ([formula]) be their charges, E be the electric field, kB be the Boltzmann constant, T be the temperature, and x be the position.

Note that we use the Einstein Relations to rewrite the mobilities, which can have either sign, in terms of diffusion constants, which are always positive. Since we always consider Z positive, if we want to consider oxygen ions and holes as the carriers, then only the sign of the electric charge e must be changed. For M3 + and O2 -, we let e  →  2e and Z = 3 / 2. Therefore our results are quite general.

Equations for Two-Component Transport

We will employ the Einstein Relations

[formula]

For electrons and metal ions, -  Zqa  =  qb, so

[formula]

where

[formula]

denotes a thermal voltage. Mott and Cabrera's paper[\cite=Cabrera1949] used (va,vb) to denote electron and ion mobilities, which they may have intended to be (νa,νb).

The one-dimensional Planck-Nernst equations for the number flux densities associated with metal ions and electrons are

[formula]

Rewriting mobilities in terms of diffusion constants using [\eqref=eq:Einstein],

[formula]

We also use the number continuity equations,

[formula]

and Gauss's Law,

[formula]

where e is electron charge in Coulombs, and ε is the permittivity of the oxide. With the charge density and current density defined by

[formula]

use of the number continuity equations yields the charge continuity equation

[formula]

Expansion Notation

We seek a series solution in powers of t- 1 / 2 for the electron and ion concentrations (densities) and fluxes, as well as for the electric field. They must satisfy the Planck-Nernst equations, the continuity equations, and Gauss's Law. Following Mott, we take the lowest order fluxes and field to vary as t- 1 / 2. Examining the structure of the Planck-Nernst equation for electrons [\eqref=eq:PNaOriginalD], and inserting terms of order t- 1 / 2, the nonlinear term naE will contain terms of order t- 1. Iteration yields that the series must be in powers of t- n / 2 for integer n.

We thus make an expansion of the form

[formula]

Here Jan, Jbn, Nan, Nbn, En, ρn, and Jn are functions of the position along the direction of growth, x. From the above definitions, the dimensionality of (Jan,Jbn) is concentration times velocity times tn / 2, the dimensionality of (Nan,Nbn) is concentration times tn / 2, the dimensionality of the surface charge density (Σ(0)n,Σ(L)n) is charge per area times tn / 2, the dimensionality of En is electric field times tn / 2, the dimensionality of ρn is charge density times tn / 2, and the dimensionality of Jn is current density times tn / 2.

On Specifying Chemical Reaction Rates at Surfaces

In the presence of a true chemical reaction at a surface there is a single reaction rate, typically specified by a Butler-Volmer relation,[\cite=Crow1994] [\cite=Rubi2003a] [\cite=Fleig2005] between the fluxes of all of the relevant components. In the present case the fluxes of the carriers are independent of one another, so that there are two statements about carrier fluxes at each surface, for a total of four conditions. With [formula] denoting an electrochemical potential, near equilibrium (as we have here, in the asymptotic regime) each flux j will be proportional to its corresponding Δ across the interface (either M/MO or MO/O). The proportionality constant will depend details of the reaction and the baseline properties of the system. That is,

[formula]

at each surface, so there are four G's. The equation becomes nonlinear far from equilibrium. Thus the ja,b are proportional to a non-equilibrium quantity, which we take to be a field E1, as in Ref. [\cite=Cabrera1949]. All of the unknown integration constants will be linear or higher in E1.

We will not attempt to carry this procedure any further. It is sufficient for our purposes to know that this can be done, and that in the present problem there are four constants associated with boundary conditions at the two surfaces for the two carriers. In principle, all of the quantities appearing in the solutions to the transport equations are determined by these surface reaction rates. For a true chemical reaction, which we expect to be described by a Butler-Volmer equation, the fluxes at each surface, because they are related, will be described by only a single independent coefficient G. Note also that the Butler-Volmer equation is non-linear, so that the boundary conditions can be nonlinear. Because we do not consider the boundary conditions in detail, we will neglect this possibility.

Relations between expansion coefficients: all n

Continuity Relations and Charge Conservation

The continuity equations imply charge conservation, so we treat them in the same subsection.

The continuity equations [\eqref=eq:Continuityab] yield

[formula]

for subscript a, and a similar relation holds for b. With m  =  (n - 2), so that [formula], comparison of like powers of t yields, for n = 1 and n = 2,

[formula]

and, for n  ≥  3,

[formula]

By definition we have

[formula]

and charge conservation for each n is

[formula]

Charge conservation at each surface yields

[formula]

so

[formula]

Comparing powers of t we have, for n = 1 and n = 2,

[formula]

and, for n  ≥  3,

[formula]

Charge conservation over both surface and bulk yields

[formula]

so that, for each n,

[formula]

Gauss's Law

Gauss's Law [\eqref=eq:Gauss] reads

[formula]

so, for each n,

[formula]

Gauss's Law at the surfaces [\eqref=eq:ESig] gives, for each n,

[formula]

Planck-Nernst

The Planck-Nernst equation for species a, [\eqref=eq:PNaOriginalD], can be written as

[formula]

or,

[formula]

with a similar form for species b,

[formula]

By matching coefficients of powers of t, we obtain the resultant equations for any n.

Solving the Transport Equations

There are five first-order differential equations for five continuous variables, so there are five integration constants at each order. For [formula] the current density Jn at x = L is known from the n - 2 value of surface charge density Σ(L)n - 2. Therefore only four integration constants need be determined. These can be thought of as fixed by the "reaction rates" of each charge carrier at each of the interfaces, which will not be specified.

The cases n = 1 and n = 2 are a bit simpler than n  ≥  3. Nevertheless, for each n our strategy will be the same: (1) from the continuity equations find the ion fluxes Jan and Jbn; (2) from all of the five equations find an equation for ρn and solve it; (3) use this ρn in Gauss's Law to find En; (4) find Nan and Nbn by substitution of Jan, Jbn and En into the Planck-Nernst equations.

Solution for n = 1

For n = 1, the calculations are simple, but illustrate what happens in higher orders. The continuity equations [\eqref=eq:PartialJa12Jb12] give Ja1 and Jb1 to be uniform, and charge conservation at each surface [\eqref=eq:SigmaJ12] gives

[formula]

The Planck-Nernst equations [\eqref=eq:FullPNa] and [\eqref=eq:FullPNb] yield

[formula]

where we take E1 as a uniform, experimentally determined value.

From the uniformity of E1,

[formula]

so that Gauss's Law yields

[formula]

Substitution of fluxes from [\eqref=eq:Ja1Jb1equal] and concentrations from [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Equal] into the Planck-Nernst equations gives

[formula]

Thus, with [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Equal], we have

[formula]

here,

[formula]

is dimensionless, and M1 is a constant of integration (units of concentration times s1 / 2) determined by the surface reaction rates (and thus linear in E1). (Recall that (Ja1,Na1) are first order coefficients, which must be multiplied by t- 1 / 2 in order to find the flux and number densities (j,n).) Although constants of integration associated with reaction rates were discussed earlier, we consider them more explicitly here.

Figure [\ref=fig:M1Graph] illustrates the effect of changing the value of M1. If M1 were very large, the high concentration of metal ions near the metal/oxide surface would oppose new ions from entering, whereas the high concentration of metal ions near the oxide/gas interface would encourage more ions to be deposited on the oxide/gas surface. Eventually, the number of metal ions in the bulk would be insufficient to maintain the high rate of ions exiting the oxide, and would drop to some equilibrium value. Thus, M1 is determined by constraining the oxide to have no net ion-loading or ion-unloading in the bulk at order n = 1. Note that E1, which is proportional to (the parabolic growth rate coefficient), is also related to the surface reaction rates. In general, net surface reaction rates involve a Butler-Volmer equation, but not far from equilibrium (as in the Mott solution) they can be linearized in the differences of various electrochemical potentials. This will ensure that there is no net surface reaction rate in the limit of equilibrium.

From Gauss's Law at the surfaces [\eqref=eq:GaussSurfaceTerms],

[formula]

Since E1 is uniform,

[formula]

For |νa| >  > |νb| (or equivalently in this case, Da >  > Db), Mott and Cabrera [\cite=Cabrera1949] find for monovalent ions that

[formula]

our results can be shown to be consistent with this.

Solution for n = 2

We here summarize the n = 2 results. (For the explicit solution, see Appendix [\ref=sec:n2appendix].) Recall that all coefficients must be multiplied by t to find the physical variables (j,n,E). With the constant M21 (in units s/  m2) determined by surface reaction rates (and thus linear in E1), the second order flux density coefficients are

[formula]

and there is no net charge flux,

[formula]

With the constants M20, P( + )a2 and P( - )a2 (each in units of s/m) determined by surface reaction rates (and thus linear in E1), the n = 2 coefficients of the concentrations of electrons and ions are given by

[formula]

Here, ls is the screening length,

[formula]

There is a net charge in the bulk, given by ρ2t- 1, where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that ρ2 has, in addition to surface charge within a screening length of the two surfaces, a uniform charge density with sign determined by e / (Da - Db) and independent of the sign of E1 (or, equivalently, the direction of current flow). Since Da  ≫  Db here, the term is positive. For holes and oxygen ions the carriers, we have - e / (Da  -  Db), but Db  ≫  Da, so it is again positive. As found in previous work,[\cite=Saslow1996a] this uniform charge density leads to a quadratic voltage profile within the bulk, not within a screening length of either surface.

The second order coefficient of the electric field is

[formula]

The surface charge coefficients are given by

[formula]

We have verified that

[formula]

so there is no net charge in the system.

Rate of Growth of Oxide Layer

The oxide layer grows as metal ions reach the MO/O surface, and are taken into lattice positions to form a new oxide layer. Thus, the rate of growth of the oxide depends on the rate jb at which metal ions arrive, according to [\eqref=eq:CurrentDrivenGrowth], or dL / dt = Ωjb. Including n = 3 (see Appendix [\ref=sec:n3appendix]) we find the metal ion number flux (using Eqs. [\eqref=eq:Ja1Jb1Solved], [\eqref=eq:Ja2Jb2Summary] or [\eqref=eq:Ja2Jb2Solved], and [\eqref=eq:Jb3]),

[formula]

where K3 is a constant of integration (units of flux density times s3 / 2) determined by interfacial reaction rates (and thus linear in E1). Note that, if Db < Da (as for ions relative to electrons) then the microscopics must give E1 > 0 for a positive growth rate. Keeping only terms of second order, integration of [\eqref=eq:Fulljb] with respect to time gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

Summary and Conclusion

We have shown that the approach taken by Mott for parabolic growth of oxide films can be turned into a consistent asymptotic expansion, and we have explicitly given the form of the lowest three orders. Up to four integration constants appear at each order, related to the surface reaction rates. At higher order the bulk film is found to be charged, with a corresponding non-uniform current density.

The Appendices present the n = 2 and n = 3 solutions in detail, to show that the method can be used for any n to find the fluxes, concentrations, surface charges and electric field. As a consequence one can have confidence that the Mott solution gives the leading term in the complete solution of the complete set of transport equations.

The most easily verifiable prediction from the viewpoint of experiment is the prediction that the first correction to the linear growth law is logarithmic. Because ln t is of order unity, data should be analyzed with an additional constant: [formula]. A sampling of the current literature[\cite=Dravnieks1951] [\cite=Martin1994a] [\cite=Lahiri1998] [\cite=Jeurgens2002] [\cite=Zhong2008a] did not find enough precision to confirm the logarithmic form of the correction term.

Explicit Solution for n = 2

By the continuity equations [\eqref=eq:PartialJa12Jb12] Ja2 and Jb2 must be uniform, and by [\eqref=eq:SigmaJ12] they are related by

[formula]

For n = 2, the Planck-Nernst equations from [\eqref=eq:FullPNa] and [\eqref=eq:FullPNb] are

[formula]

Taking spatial derivatives of [\eqref=eq:PNa2] and [\eqref=eq:PNb2], and using Gauss's Law [\eqref=eq:GaussTerms] and the uniformity of Ja2 and Jb2, yields

[formula]

The right hand sides are found from [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Solved];

[formula]

where H is defined in [\eqref=eq:H].

Subtracting [\eqref=eq:PartialPNa2] multiplied by 1 / Da from [\eqref=eq:PartialPNb2] multiplied by Z / Db yields

[formula]

The solution to this equation, with

[formula]

and with new integration constants P( + )2 and P( - )2, is

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:Delta2Solved] we infer that Na2 and ZNb2 are polynomials whose terms that are linear or higher are equal, and they may have different exponential terms.

Substituting ρ2 from [\eqref=eq:Delta2Solved] into Gauss's Law [\eqref=eq:GaussTerms], and integrating ∂xE2 yields

[formula]

where F2 is a new integration constant with units V-s/  m.

By [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Solved], (Na1,Nb1) are linear in x, so that the right-hand-side of the Planck-Nernst equation [\eqref=eq:PNa2] is linear in x. Moreover, the continuity equation [\eqref=eq:PartialJa12Jb12] implies that Ja2 is constant. Therefore by [\eqref=eq:E2Solved] for E2, the Planck-Nernst equation allows ∂xNa2 to be linear, so Na2 can be quadratic in x. Moreover, the exponential terms in (Da / VT)n0E2 + Da∂xNa2 must cancel. Finally, from [\eqref=eq:Delta2Solved] any linear or quadratic terms in Na2 and ZNb2 must be equal. With (M20,M21,M22,P(  ±  )a2) being new integration constants, we therefore conclude that the following form must hold:

[formula]

Use of [\eqref=eq:rho_n-J_n] for n = 2 (ρ2  =  e(ZNb2  -  Na2)), and ρ2 of [\eqref=eq:Delta2Solved] gives

[formula]

Addition of [\eqref=eq:PNa2] divided by Da and [\eqref=eq:PNb2] divided by Db gives, with [\eqref=eq:Ja2Jb2Relation] and [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Solved],

[formula]

Substitution for Na2 and Nb2 from [\eqref=eq:Na2Generic] and [\eqref=eq:Nb2Generic] allows us to solve for some of the constants,

[formula]

So, since Ja2 is uniform, comparison of powers of x yields the conditions

[formula]

We may thus rewrite [\eqref=eq:Na2Generic] and [\eqref=eq:Nb2Generic] as

[formula]

Note that in [\eqref=eq:PNa2] the exponential and linear coefficients already match, by construction. A new constraint, however, is found by comparing the constant terms,

[formula]

yielding the condition that

[formula]

We are thus left with four independent constants of integration, which we take to be M20, M21, P( + )2, and P( - )2. The reaction rates for electrons and ions at each interface, needed to produce the correct ion fluxes, provide the 4 conditions necessary to solve for these constants.

For completeness we note that, from Gauss's Law at each surface [\eqref=eq:GaussSurfaceTerms],

[formula]

Then [\eqref=eq:E2Solved] and [\eqref=eq:F2Solved] yield

[formula]

Solution for n = 3

Recall that in order n = 3, all coefficients must be multiplied by t3 / 2 to find the physical variables (j,n,E).

Using the n = 1 coefficients for electron and metal ion number densities from [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Solved] and the continuity equations from [\eqref=eq:PartialJanJbn] for n = 3,

[formula]

Integration of these two equations gives two integration constants. However, these two constatnts are constrained by charge conservation across the interface at x = 0 [\eqref=eq:SigmaJn],

[formula]

where Σ(0)1 is given by [\eqref=eq:Sigma1]. Integration of the continuity equations [\eqref=eq:PartialJ3] then yields only a single new integration constant, which we call K3:

[formula]

There is a uniform net electric charge flux (i.e., current density) at order n = 3,

[formula]

due to the discharge of the surfaces in order n = 1.

For n = 3, the Planck-Nernst equations from [\eqref=eq:FullPNa] and [\eqref=eq:FullPNb] are

[formula]

Taking spatial derivatives of [\eqref=eq:PNa3] and [\eqref=eq:PNb3], and using Gauss's Law [\eqref=eq:GaussTerms],

[formula]

Subtracting [\eqref=eq:PartialPNa3] multiplied by 1 / Da from [\eqref=eq:PartialPNb3] multiplied by Z / Db yields an equation for ρ3,

[formula]

Substitution for (Na1,Nb1) from [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Solved], (Na2,Nb2) from [\eqref=eq:Na2] and [\eqref=eq:Nb2], E2 from [\eqref=eq:E2Solved], and Ja3 from [\eqref=eq:Ja3] yields The solution to this second order differential equation, with two new integration constants β( + )1 and β( - )1, is

[formula]

where, with substitution of F2 from [\eqref=eq:F2Solved],

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:DeltaN3] we infer that Na3 and ZNb3 may include polynomials whose terms that are quadratic and higher are equal, and may include exponential terms that differ.

Substituting ρ3 from [\eqref=eq:DeltaN3] into Gauss's Law [\eqref=eq:GaussTerms], and integrating ∂xE3 gives

[formula]

where F3 is a new integration constant, with units V-s3 / 2/m.

Substitution of the coefficients Na1 from [\eqref=eq:Na1Nb1Solved], Na2 from [\eqref=eq:Na2Generic], E2 from [\eqref=eq:E2Solved], Ja3 from [\eqref=eq:Ja3], and E3 from [\eqref=eq:E3] into the n = 3 Planck-Nernst equation for electrons [\eqref=eq:PNa3] yields The solution to this first order differential equation, with one new integration constant M30, is

[formula]

where

[formula]

Use of [\eqref=eq:rho_n-J_n] for n = 3 (ρ3  =  e(ZNb3 - Na3)), ρ3 from [\eqref=eq:DeltaN3], and Na3 from [\eqref=eq:Na3] gives

[formula]

We now have Ja3, Jb3, E3, Na3 and Nb3 with five constants of integration, K3, β( + )1, β( - )1, F3, and M30. To reduce this from five to four, we add [\eqref=eq:PNa3] divided by Da and [\eqref=eq:PNb3] divided by Db,

[formula]

As for n = 2, in [\eqref=eq:SumPNa3PNb3] the exponential, quadratic, and linear terms match, by construction. A new constraint, however, is found by comparing the constant terms,

[formula]

Substituting M31 from [\eqref=eq:M31] yields

[formula]

a relation between integration constants F3 and K3.

We are thus left with four independent constants of integration, which we take to be K3, M30, β( + )1, and β( - )1. The reaction rates for electrons and ions at each interface, needed to produce the correct ion fluxes, provide the four conditions necessary to solve for these constants.

For completeness, we note that from Gauss's Law at each surface [\eqref=eq:GaussSurfaceTerms],

[formula]

Then, [\eqref=eq:E3] yields

[formula]

We have verified that

[formula]

so there is no net charge in the system.
