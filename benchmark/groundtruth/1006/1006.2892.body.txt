Novel Isotope Effects on the Pairing Pseudogap in High-Tc Cuprates: Evidences for Polaronic Metal and Precursor BCS-Like Pairing of Large Polarons

Superconductivity in ordinary and polaronic metals is the result of two distinct quantum phenomena (as argued in Refs.[\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5]): pairing of charge carriers at a characteristic temperature [formula] and condensation of bound pairs into a superfluid state at the superconducting (SC) transition temperature Tc. In conventional superconductors, pairing of electrons and superfluidity of Cooper pairs occur simultaneously at [formula]. In high-Tc cuprates, however, the pairing of charge carriers may occur at a higher temperature [formula] than the Tc at which the pre-formed Cooper pairs condense into a superfluid (or SC) state [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3]. As a consequence, below [formula] a pseudogap (PG) appears in cuprates, as seen in many experiments (NMR, ARPES, optical conductivity, specific heat, etc.) (see Refs.[\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] for a review). Most of the theories proposed for the high-Tc cuprates are based on different electronic mechanisms of pairing and ingnore effects arising from the electron-phonon interactions. However, a number of experiments revealing the peculiar isotope effects on Tc, [formula] and other physical quantities in cuprates [\cite=9] [\cite=10] [\cite=11] [\cite=12] [\cite=13] [\cite=14] [\cite=15] have shown that the electron-phonon interactions play a major role in these materials. In particular, some experiments showed that the oxygen and copper isotope effects on [formula] in - and - based cuprates are absent or very small [\cite=9] [\cite=14] and sizable [\cite=9] [\cite=13] [\cite=14]. While other experiments revealed the presence of large negative oxygen and copper isotope effects on [formula] in -based cuprates [\cite=11] [\cite=13]. The origin of the novel isotope effects on [formula] in cuprates has especially been the subject of controversy [\cite=9] [\cite=10] [\cite=11]. Although some theories [\cite=16] [\cite=17] [\cite=18] were used to describe the oxygen isotope effect on [formula] in high-Tc cuprates, they cannot give an answer to the puzzling question why such an isotope effect is sizable or very large in some cuprates and absent in others. Also, there is no explanation of the observed copper isotope effect on [formula] in cuprates.

In this Letter, we address the above issues of the isotope effects on the pairing PG in the cuprates by proposing two BCS-based approaches extended to the intermediate-coupling regime, which allow to describe the precursor pairing of large polarons above Tc in underdoped and optimally doped cuprates with small and large Fermi surfaces. We derive new expressions for the mean-field pairing temperature [formula] and the isotope exponents [formula]. Remarkably, our results for [formula], isotope shifts and exponents in slightly underdoped and optimally doped cuprates are in quantitative agreement with existing experiments and resolve the controversy between various experiments. We also make quantitative predictions for the isotope effects on [formula] in the deeply underdoped cuprates.

In conventional superconductors the mass of free electrons is independent of the ionic mass M. In contrast, the charge carriers in polar materials are self-trapped and form large polarons (quasiparticles dressed by lattice distortions) [\cite=19]. In the polaronic model, the mass of polarons mp depends on the longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon-frequency ωLO which in turn depends on M. The observed effective mass of charge carriers in cuprates is about 2me (where me is the free electron mass) [\cite=20] and the relatively small binding energies Ep = 0.06eV and Ep = 0.12eV of the polaron are observed in optimally doped and underdoped cuprates, respectively [\cite=21]. These and other experiments [\cite=20] [\cite=22] prove that the charge carriers in cuprates are large polarons.

Here we consider the real physical situations in cuprates, namely, the cases of small and large Fermi surfaces. In slightly underdoped and optimally doped cuprates with large Fermi surfaces, the new situation arises when the polaronic effect exists and the attractive interaction mechanism (e.g., due to exchange of static and dynamic phonons) between the carriers operating in the energy range { - (Ep  +  ωLO),(Ep  +  ωLO)} is more effective than in the simple BCS picture. The energies ε of polarons are measured from the polaronic Fermi energy εF. It was argued [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] (see also Ref. [\cite=23]) that the extension of the BCS theory to the intermediate coupling regime describes the precursor pairing of carriers above Tc. At [formula], using a similar BCS-based approach, we obtain a new and more general expression for the mean-field pairing temperature [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the BCS-like coupling constant, Np(εF) is the polaronic density of states (DOS), ṽp = Vph - Vc is the effective polaron-polaron interaction potential, which has both the attractive electron-phonon interaction part Vph and the screened repulsive Coulomb interaction part [formula], ζc is the cut-off for the Coulomb interaction Vc, ζc > Ep  +  ωLO. The usual BCS approximation as the particular case is recovered in the weak coupling regime (i.e. in the absence of polaronic effects, Ep = 0) and the prefactor in Eq.([\ref=Eq.1]) is replaced by Debye energy ωD. Here we show that the polaronic effects change significantly the simple BCS picture and are responsible for the novel isotope effects on [formula]. In the large polaron theory, mp, Ep and εF  =  2(3π2n)2 / 3 / 2mp (where n is the concentration of large polarons) depend on the Fröhlich-type electron-phonon coupling constant αF which in turn depends on the masses M( = MO or MCu) and M'( = MCu or MO) of the oxygen and copper atoms in cuprates:

[formula]

where [formula], β is a force constant of the lattice, ε∞ and ε0 are the high frequency and static dielectric constants, respectively, [formula] is the effective mass of a carrier in the absence of the electron-phonon interaction. In the intermediate electron-phonon coupling regime the mass and binding energy of a large polaron are given by [formula] and Ep  =  αFωLO [\cite=19]

The polaronic DOS can be approximated in a simple form

[formula]

From Eq.([\ref=Eq.1]), the exponent of the isotope effect on [formula] is defined as

[formula]

Using the above expressions for mp, Ep and Np(εF), the Eqs. ([\ref=Eq.1]) and ([\ref=Eq.4]) can be written as

[formula]

and where [formula], Uc(μ) = 1 + λc(1 + bμ1 / 4) ln Bc(μ), [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], b = 1 / 6a,   =  ε∞ / (1 - ε∞  /  ε0), μ = MM' / (M + M') is the reduced mass of ions.

Equations ([\ref=Eq.5]) and ([\ref=Eq.6]) allow us to calculate the PG temperature [formula] and the exponents [formula] and [formula] of the oxygen and copper isotope effects on [formula]. In our numerical calculations, we take [formula] [\cite=20], ε∞ = 3  -  5 [\cite=20] [\cite=24], ε0 = 22  -  30 [\cite=20] [\cite=24] and ωLO = 0.04  -  0.07eV [\cite=7] [\cite=20], typical values for the cuprates. Then the values of [formula] and αF are [formula] and αF = 2.15  -  5.54 (which correspond to the intermediate electron-phonon coupling regime). Notice that in discussing the experimental data for isotope effects on [formula] in cuprates we have taken the fact that the physical situations (doping levels, dielectric constants, [formula]) in various experiments are rather different. The magnitude of β is kept at the value estimated for the oxygen and copper unsubstituted compound using a given value of ωLO. Since the quantity ζc is of the order of εF, the logarithm ln Bc(μ) will be small, so that the Coulomb pseudopotential ṽc is of the order of bare Coulomb potential Vc. The results of numerical calculations of [formula] and [formula] according to Eqs.([\ref=Eq.5]) and ([\ref=Eq.6]) at different values of ωLO, [formula], n, λph and λc are shown in Figs.1 - 3.

Our results provide a consistent picture of the existence of crossover temperature [formula] above Tc and peculiar isotope effects on [formula] in cuprates. They explain why the small positive (see Fig.1) and very large negative (see Figs.2 and 3) oxygen isotope effects and the large negative and near-absent copper isotope effects on [formula] are observed in various experiments. The obtained [formula] is plotted in the insets of Figs. 1 - 3 as a function of [formula] and n for different values of λph and λc. The values of [formula] varies from 0.3 to 0.5 and [formula] increases with decreasing n. We have verified that [formula] decreases with increasing [formula] for λph < 0.35 and λc < 0.1 (Fig.1). In contrast, [formula] increase with increasing [formula] for λph > 0.4 and λc > 0.25 (Fig.2). The existing experimental data on [formula] and [formula] could be fitted with an excellent agreement using Eqs. ([\ref=Eq.5]) and ([\ref=Eq.6]), and adjusting the parameters ωLO, [formula], n, λph and λc for each cuprate supercondutor. If we choose ωLO = 0.05eV, [formula],  = 4.841  -  5.045, [formula] and [formula], we see that [formula] and [formula] is very small (i.e., [formula]), which are consistent with the experimental data of Ref. [\cite=9]. Further, using other sets of parameters [formula],  = 5.904  -  6.119, λph = 0.311  -  0.313 and λc  =  0.067  -  0.070, we obtain [formula] and [formula], which are in good agreement with the measured values: [formula] and [formula] for [formula] (with Tc = 81K) [\cite=10]. Figure 1 illustrates the predicted behaviors of [formula] and [formula] as a function of [formula] for λph < 0.4 and λc < 0.1. We see that [formula] decreases slowly with decreasing [formula]. Relatively strong electron-phonon and Coulomb interactions (i.e., λph > 0.5 and λc > 0.5) change the picture significantly and cause [formula] to decrease rapidly with decreasing [formula]. In this case the value of [formula] is negative and becomes very large negative with decreasing [formula] or [formula]. The pictures shown in Figs.2 and 3 are likely realized in some cuprates (which exhibit a large negative isotope exponent [formula]) and explain another important puzzle of the cuprates [\cite=11]: the huge oxygen-isotope effect on [formula] observed in [formula], whose characteristic PG temperature [formula] increases significantly upon replacing [formula] by [formula]. Indeed, with fitting parameters, [formula],  = 5.088, λph = 0.975 and λc = 0.82, one can explain the observed experimental data of Ref. [\cite=11]. In this case, we obtain [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], which are in remarkably good agreement with the experimental data [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] [\cite=11]. The above predicted behaviors of [formula] and [formula] could be checked experimentally in other slightly underdoped and optimally doped cuprates. We have also performed similar calculations for the copper isotope effect on [formula] in slightly underdoped [formula] (where the electron-phonon and Coulomb interactions seem to be much stronger than in [formula]), and for the oxygen and copper isotope effects on [formula] in optimally doped [formula]. In order to obtain the values of [formula] and [formula] observed accordingly in copper unsubstitituted and substituted [formula], we took ωLO = 0.05eV, [formula],  = 4.937, λph = 2.196, λc = 2.064. Then we found [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] in accordance with experimental findings [formula], [formula] and [formula] [\cite=13]. In the orthothombic [formula] the optimally doped level ([formula]) corresponds to the value [formula]. By taking ωLO = 0.045eV,  = 5.681, λph = 0.578 and λc = 0.463 for [formula], we obtained [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]; [formula], which agree with the experimental data of Ref. [\cite=14].

The situation is different for the deeply underdoped cuprate with a small Fermi surface. In this case, the polaronic effect is strong enough and the condition εF < Ep is satisfied. Therefore, Ep  +  ωLO and [formula] in Eq.([\ref=Eq.1]) would be replaced by εF and [formula], respectively. It is easy to verify numerically that, for [formula] (or [formula]), the PG temperature [formula] can be determined from the BCS-like relation

[formula]

where [formula].

Using Eqs. ([\ref=Eq.4]) and ([\ref=Eq.7]), we obtain

[formula]

The dependences [formula] and [formula] for ωLO = 0.05eV, λph  -  λc = 0.3 and [formula] are presented in Fig.4. As seen from Fig.4, the [formula] is rather small and negative. The [formula] is also negative and nearly four times smaller than [formula].

In conclusion, we have developed two new BCS-based approaches extended to the intermediate coupling regime to describe the precursor pairing of large polarons above Tc and the peculiar isotope effects on the PG temperature [formula] in high-Tc cuprates with small and large Fermi surfaces. Our results show that the oxygen isotope effect on [formula] in optimally doped cuprates with moderate electron-phonon coupling strength (λph < 0.4) and weak Coulomb repulsion (λc < 0.1) is small positive. At λph > 0.5 and λc < 0.5 the negative oxygen and copper isotope effects on [formula] in the same compound (e.g., [formula]) is large and negligible, respectively. While the very large negative oxygen and copper isotope effects on [formula] exist in some cuprates with large Fermi surfaces at λph < 1, [formula] and λph  >  λc > 2, respectively. The existing experimental data and discrepancies between experiments measuring the isotope effects on [formula] in various cuprates are consistently explained by the proposed general BCS-like pairing model. We predict that the isotope effects on [formula] in the deeply underdoped cuprates are sizable and negative.
