Introduction

Let [formula] be the Euclidean norm. Let [formula] and [formula] be two configurations of N points, where each [formula] and each [formula]. If for all 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  N, [formula], we say that [formula] is an expansion of [formula] and [formula] is a contraction of [formula]. We denote by [formula] the closed d-dimensional ball of radius ri  ≥  0 in [formula] about the point [formula], and by [formula] we denote the boundary of [formula]. Let [formula] represent the d-dimensional volume.

The following is a longstanding conjecture independently stated by Kneser [\cite=Kneser] in 1955 and Poulsen [\cite=Poulsen] in 1954 for the case when [formula]:

If [formula] is an expansion of [formula] in [formula], then for any vector of radii [formula],

[formula]

This conjecture is proved by K. Bezdek and R. Connelly in [\cite=BezdekConnelly] only for the case when d = 2. References to related results as well as the history of this conjecture can be found in the same paper [\cite=BezdekConnelly]. In the current paper we prove the following theorem:

If in the initial configuration of closed balls, determined by their centers [formula] in [formula] and radii [formula], each pair of balls has common points with no more than d + 1 other balls, then for any expansion [formula] of the centers [formula] inequality ([\ref=KPineq]) holds.

As the limiting case of this theorem, we get the following corollary:

If in the initial configuration of closed balls, determined by their centers [formula] in [formula] and radii [formula], each pair of balls has common interior points with no more than d + 1 other balls, then for any expansion [formula] of the centers [formula] inequality ([\ref=KPineq]) holds.

Voronoi decomposition

Let [formula] be a configuration of points in [formula] with balls of radii [formula] centered at corresponding points of the configuration. Consider a one parameter family [formula] which coincides with the initial vector of radii, when s = 0.

The following sets are called (extended) nearest point Voronoi regions:

[formula]

The next remark can be easily verified.

The sets [formula] do not depend on the parameter s.

Now we consider so called truncated Voronoi regions [formula], and for each i  ≠  j, define the wall between two truncated Voronoi regions: [formula].

Further we will be interested in the behavior of the function

[formula]

Consider a smooth (infinitely many times differentiable) motion [formula] of some configuration of N points in [formula]. Let [formula], and let dij' be the t-derivative of dij. The following is Csikós's formula [\cite=Csikos98] for the t-derivative of the function [formula].

Let d  ≥  2 and let [formula] be a smooth motion of a configuration of points in [formula] such that for each t, all the points are pairwise distinct. Then the function [formula] is differentiable with respect to t and,

[formula]

Truncated polytopes

Let M be an n-dimensional Euclidian space where n  ≥  2, and let [formula] be a point in it.

Note that truncated Voronoi regions [formula] are truncated polytopes in [formula], and each wall [formula] is a truncated polytope in the hyperplane Lij that contains the intersection of the spheres [formula]. Indeed, [formula] is the intersection of finitely many halfspaces in Lij intersected with a ball of radius [formula], where hij is the distance from the point [formula] to the hyperplane Lij.

The next lemma is slightly reformulated Corollary 6 from [\cite=BezdekConnelly].

Let [formula] be a truncated polytope in an (n + 2)-dimensional Euclidian space M, such that all the boundary hyperplanes [formula] are orthogonal to some n-dimensional affine subspace S  ⊂  M, and [formula]. Then the following derivative exists and

[formula]

The set [formula] is a truncated polytope in S, so by induction we get the following corollary:

Let [formula] be a truncated polytope in an (n + 2k)-dimensional Euclidian space M, such that all the boundary hyperplanes [formula] are orthogonal to some n-dimensional affine subspace S  ⊂  M, and [formula]. Then the following derivative exists and

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be configurations of centers that together with the vector of radii [formula] satisfy the conditions of Theorem [\ref=MainTh]. For each positive integer k we can regard [formula] as the subset [formula]. We chose k to be sufficiently large, so that there exists a smooth motion [formula] defined for t∈[0,1] where [formula], [formula], [formula], and for each pair of indices i  ≠  j the distance [formula] is non-decreasing as a function of t.

Under conditions of Theorem [\ref=MainTh], for each pair of indices i  ≠  j and [formula] the functions

[formula]

are continuous and nonnegative in some fixed closed rectangle (t,s)∈[0,1]  ×  [ -   ε,ε].

The lemma is obvious for l = 0, since the volume of the wall is nonnegative and depends continuously on the variables s and t.

By Lij(t) denote the hyperplane that contains the intersection of the spheres [formula]. By assumption of Theorem [\ref=MainTh] for t = 0 in the beginning ball configuration there are no more than d + 1 triple intersections that involve balls [formula] and [formula]. It is easy to check that since for each t > 0, [formula] is an expansion of [formula], new triple intersections cannot appear as we increase t. Thus, for each t the wall [formula] is a truncated polytope in Lij(t) such that it can be defined as a ball intersected with no more than d + 1 halfspaces. Since Lij(t) is a (d + 2k - 1)-dimensional Euclidian space, then for each [formula] there exists a (d + 2k - 2l + 1)-dimensional plane Sij,l(t)  ⊆  Lij(t) that is orthogonal to all of the boundary hyperplanes of the wall [formula]. We can choose Sij,l(t) to depend continuously on t.

By Corollary [\ref=ArhimedCol]

[formula]

Let hij(t) denote the distance from the point [formula] to the hyperplane Lij(t). Then [formula] is the radius of the ball that intersects the halfspaces to form the truncated polytope [formula] in Lij(t). Thus,

[formula]

Note that [formula] is the perimeter of the spherical part of the truncated polytope [formula] in Sij,l(t):

[formula]

where [formula] is the orthogonal projection of the point [formula] onto the hyperplane Lij(t). Since the perimeter is always nonnegative, this shows that the functions in ([\ref=DWalls]) are nonnegative. Since the plane Sij,l(t) and the wall [formula] depend continuously on s and t, the functions in ([\ref=DWalls]) are continuous as well.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTh]

Note that the sets [formula] and [formula] are disjoint unions of truncated Voronoi regions, so we can apply Corollary [\ref=ArhimedCol] to them:

[formula]

Now by applying Csikós's formula (Theorem [\ref=Csikos]) we get that

[formula]

Since the functions in ([\ref=DWalls]) are continuous as shown in Lemma [\ref=ContLemma], the last expression can be written as

[formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=ContLemma], the function inside the integral is nonnegative, so the whole expression is nonnegative. This proves the theorem.
