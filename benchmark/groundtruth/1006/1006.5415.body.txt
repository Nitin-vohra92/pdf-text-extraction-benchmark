Introduction

We study the long time behaviour of models of population dynamics. We consider a finite number of subpopulations whose dynamics is governed by a system of competitive ODEs (in the sense of Hirsch, see e.g. [\cite=hirsch-88]). We denote by ni(t), [formula], the number of individuals of the subpopulation i.

The most classical models are competitive Lotka-Volterra equations

[formula]

where bij  ≥  0, and the models with a finite number of resources

[formula]

where ηki  ≥  0 and the Ik are given by the Holling II functional response This type of system appears in biology when one studies the dynamics of a system of interacting species (see [\cite=HS] [\cite=Gop] [\cite=Kri]). It also appears in Trait Substitution Sequence models, where one considers a population structured by a continuous phenotype (see equation [\eqref=Eqlcont], [\eqref=continuous] on this matter), where only a small number of traits are present (see [\cite=MGMJH] [\cite=Cha]). These models have been used to develop the theory of Adaptative Dynamics (see [\cite=MGMJH] [\cite=Cha] [\cite=Di]).

Previous asymptotic studies on this type of equations concern either very general properties (the existence of a carrying simplex [\cite=hirsch-88]), or precise results but only for low dimensional systems (N  ≤  3 [\cite=zeeman-93]), under strong assumptions of the coefficients (for instance, the matrix (bij) is supposed to be diagonal dominant, see [\cite=HS]), or only on local properties (the equilibrium population is locally stable, or populations ni do not vanish).

Note that both equations [\eqref=Eql] and [\eqref=Eqr] may be interpreted as discrete versions of continuous models. To each subpopulation corresponds a phenotypic trait [formula], and then posing

[formula]

one finds that Eq. [\eqref=Eql] for instance is equivalent to

[formula]

with ri = r(xi) and bij = b(xi,xj).

The long time behaviour of the continuous model [\eqref=Eqlcont] (with bounded initial data instead of Dirac masses) was studied in [\cite=JR]. For a symmetric b defining a positive operator, the convergence to the unique stable equilibrium was proved. For the case with resources, the result is essentially contained in [\cite=CJ], which generalizes the derivation of [\cite=DJMP].

The study of the discrete or continuous models corresponds to slighty different biological questions; in the continuous case, it is for instance connected to the issue of speciation, or how from a continuum of traits a few well separated ones (the "species") are selected; in the discrete case, one is rather concerned about survival or extinction of each subpopulations. From a rigorous mathematical point of view, a result in the continuous case does not imply anything for the discrete one. However it is easy to apply the techniques developed in [\cite=JR] and [\cite=CJ] to the discrete models; that is our aim.

First of all, we consider the very general equation

[formula]

with (Ω,P) any measurable space, or in the continuous case

[formula]

We prove the following

Assume that L is C1 on [formula] and non negative on [formula], that K and B are non negative, in [formula] and that (i) (Strict competition) L is strictly increasing and [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  N, where L(  ∞  ): =  lim x  →    +    ∞L(x)∈(0, +   ∞  ]. (ii) (Symmetry) There exists Ci > 0 s.t. Bi(α) = Ci  Ki(α) (iii) (Non extinction) For any i, [formula] (iv) (Non degeneracy) For any subset [formula], let [formula] be the set of [formula] s.t. ni = 0 for all [formula]. For all [formula], there exists at most one [formula] s.t.

[formula]

Then there exists a unique [formula] with n̄  ≠  0, s.t. for any solution [formula] to [\eqref=discrete] with initial data ni(0) > 0 for any i,

[formula]

Note that, if one had [formula] for some i, then ni(t)  →    +    ∞   if ni(0) > 0. Assumption (i) hence ensures the non-explosion of the system.

Eq. [\eqref=discrete] could be directly derived from simple biological considerations. It assumes that the reproduction rate of a population of type i (or with trait xi) is the difference between a fixed rate depending only on the trait and a competitive interaction with the other populations, resulting from the interaction with the environment. The state of each component of this environment (indicated by different values of α) is given by the sum

[formula]

Each such component has some independent effect on the reproduction. To get the total reproduction rate one sums over those.

Eq. [\eqref=discrete] is hence an obvious generalization, with a possibly infinite number of resources, of the model [\eqref=Eqr]. It also contains the Lotka-Volterra system [\eqref=Eql]. In this case, Theorem [\ref=mainthm] gives

Assume that ri > 0 for all i and that the matrix bij satisfies

[formula]

then there exists a unique [formula] with n̄  ≠  0, s.t. for any solution [formula] to [\eqref=Eql] with initial data ni(0) > 0 for any i,

[formula]

This result shows that, in Lotka-Volterra systems which are symmetric in the sense of ([\ref=hypb]), the competition between a mutant trait and a resident population leads to a unique stationary state, regardless of the initial population state. This is precisely the assumption needed in [\cite=Cha] to apply a limit of large population and rare mutations to an individual-based model. In particular, Thm. 2.7 of [\cite=Cha] applies to symmetric competitive Lotka-Volterra systems.

Proof of Prop. [\ref=propb]. Define the matrix mij = Ci  bij. Note that m is symmetric and positive definite. Hence there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors Ui, [formula], and corresponding eigenvalues λi > 0.

Then put [formula], Ω  =  {1,...,N}, [formula], [formula], [formula] and note that

[formula]

Therefore Eq. [\eqref=discrete] indeed yields [\eqref=Eql] in that particular case.

Conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] are obviously satisfied. Conditions (iii) holds since ri > 0 for all i and L(0) = 0. As for condition (iv), assume that for a subset I one has two vectors nγj, γ = 1,2, s.t. nγi = 0 for [formula] and

[formula]

Put δn = n1 - n2 and simply note that [formula] pour [formula].

This means that δn = 0 and proves (iv) since [formula]. Hence the proposition is implied by Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. 6pt 500 -2pt

Note that the same argument works in the continuous case and Eq. [\eqref=Eqlcont] is a particular case of [\eqref=continuous] for x∈O a bounded domain. The condition on b is

[formula]

One still puts L(ξ) = ξ. Notice that C(x)  b(x,y) defines a compact, selfadjoint and positive operator on L2(O). Diagonalizing the operator, one gets

[formula]

with λα > 0 the eigenvalues, tending to +    ∞   and fα the corresponding normalized eigenvector. It is hence enough to take [formula] and [formula]

In the particular case where b(x,y) = b(x - y) on the whole [formula] and C = 1, by Fourier transform, the condition on b means that  > 0. One then takes [formula] and

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

The proof is based on the study of the following Lyapunov functional

[formula]

where H is an antiderivative of L and hence strictly convex.

F is a strict Lyapunov functional

Let n be a solution to [\eqref=discrete]. Then by a direct computation

[formula]

Therefore F(n(t)) is non increasing and its derivative in time vanishes only on stationary solutions to [\eqref=discrete], i.e. F is a strict Lyapunov functional for the system ([\ref=discrete]). Thanks to condition (i),

[formula]

if ni is large enough. Therefore, there is a constant a' > 0 s.t. [formula] if [formula] is large enough. This implies that F(n)  →    +    ∞   when [formula], and entails that n(t) is uniformly bounded.

Let [formula] be a steady-state of [\eqref=discrete] and let I be the set of i s.t. ni > 0. Then, for any i∈I one needs to have

[formula]

By condition (iv) there is at most one such solution for every I, and there are only a finite number of possible I, F has then a finite number of steady-states.

Classical Lyapunov functionnals' techniques then entail that the solution n(t) to ([\ref=discrete]) converges to a steady-state ñ for any initial condition n(0).

The functional F is convex

Compute

[formula]

Hence as L is increasing

[formula]

F is therefore convex and any local minimum on [formula] is global.

Since ([\ref=discrete]) has a finite number of stationary solutions, this clearly implies that F admits a unique global minimizer n̄. Otherwise, F would reach its minimum on the whole segment linking two distinct minimizers.

The object of the next subsection is to prove that n̄ satisfies a stronger property: this is the unique ESS of the system.

Uniqueness of the ESS

Any local minimizer [formula] of the functional F necessarily satisfies

[formula]

This condition corresponds to the usual definition of an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy in adaptive dynamics (see for instance [\cite=Di]). It turns out that there exists at most one ESS, n̄. Hence being an ESS is a necessary and sufficient condition to be the global minimizer of F.

Indeed take two [formula], γ = 1,2 satisfying [\eqref=ESS] and compute

[formula]

This last quantity is equal to (thanks to [\eqref=ESS])

[formula]

and to

[formula]

As L is strictly increasing, this implies that for P a.e. α, [formula] and by (iv), it means that n1 = n2.

Conclusion of the proof of Thm. [\ref=mainthm]

Assume that ni(0) > 0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  N. We know from Subsection [\ref=sub1] that n(t) converges to a steady-state ñ when t  →    ∞  .

If ñ does not satisfy [\eqref=ESS], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Since ni(0) > 0, ni > 0 at all times, and the linearized equation around ñ shows that n cannot converge to ñ:

[formula]

provided that [formula] is small enough.

Therefore, ñ  =  n̄, and the proof of Thm. [\ref=mainthm] is completed.
