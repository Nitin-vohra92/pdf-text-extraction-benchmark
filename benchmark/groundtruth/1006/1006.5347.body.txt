The notion of a co-t-structure on a triangulated category was introduced independently by the author in [\cite=Co-t-structures] and Bondarko in [\cite=Bondarko]. In [\cite=Bondarko] they are referred to as weight structures; in this note we continue the terminology of [\cite=Co-t-structures]. In [\cite=Bondarko] they are introduced in the context of understanding Grothendieck's weight filtration in Voevodsky's triangulated category of motives; see also [\cite=Bondarko-coniveau]. In [\cite=Achar_Treumann] co-t-structures are important ingredients in the proofs of purity and decomposition theorems for 'staggered sheaves', and in [\cite=Wildeshaus2] and [\cite=Wildeshaus] they are studied in the context of Chow motives and Artin-Tate motives, respectively. In the representation theoretic setting, co-t-structures have recently been studied in connection with the Auslander-Buchweitz context in [\cite=Mendoza].

In view of their recent proliferation into different branches of mathematics, it is useful to establish basic results regarding the structure and behaviour of co-t-structures, and, in particular, their relation with, similarities to, and differences from t-structures. In this sense, the present note should be viewed as an extension of [\cite=Co-t-structures] providing co-t-structure analogues of the corresponding results for t-structures in [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten].

Throughout this note, [formula] will be a triangulated category with set indexed coproducts and and [formula] will denote its suspension functor. We direct the reader to [\cite=Holm_Jorgensen] for an introduction to triangulated categories. We first recall some definitions. An object S of [formula] is called rigid if [formula] for all i > 0 (see [\cite=Iyama]); S is called compact if for any set indexed family of objects {Xi}i∈I of [formula] one has the natural isomorphism [formula]. Recall also that a generating set for [formula] is a set of objects [formula] such that if [formula] for all [formula] then X = 0.

In [\cite=Miyachi], if one takes a compact rigid object S of [formula] such that [formula] is a generating set, then one obtains a canonical t-structure on [formula] given by

[formula]

In [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten], it is established that any compact object S of [formula] induces a canonical t-structure on [formula] given by

[formula]

Since the 'torsion-free class' [formula] of a t-structure is always closed under non-positive suspensions, this description of [formula] is natural. However, an obvious question is whether the 'torsion class' [formula] also has such a nice description. In [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten], this is shown to be the case if and only if the hypotheses of [\cite=Miyachi] hold. A natural question is thus: what happens if one specifies the 'torsion class' [formula] and sets [formula]? Unfortunately, it seems that this is not possible in general for t-structures but the situation arises naturally in the setting of co-t-structures.

Another motivation is that the theory of co-t-structures seems to be richer when there exist adjacent t-structures (see [\cite=Bondarko]). However, as remarked in [\cite=Bondarko], the question of existence of an adjacent co-t-structure when a triangulated category is endowed with a t-structure is difficult in general. The main result of this note provides a case where such adjacent (co)-t-structures exist.

We now recall the definition of a co-t-structure:

Definition

In [\cite=Co-t-structures] an object S of [formula] is called a simply connected corigid object of [formula] if

S is corigid, that is, [formula] for i > 0;

[formula];

[formula] is a division ring.

We shall refer to S as a connected corigid object of [formula] if the first two conditions hold.

Motivated by the observation that the case studied in [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten] and [\cite=Miyachi] represents a 'chain situation', and that, often, a 'cochain situation' is more natural (see [\cite=Co-t-structures] for more remarks on this), the author showed in [\cite=Co-t-structures] that if S is a simply connected corigid object of [formula] and [formula] is a generating set for [formula], then one has a canonical co-t-structure on [formula] given by

[formula]

Observe that the class of objects [formula] above coincides with the 'torsion class' [formula] of [\eqref=BR_t-structure]. It is natural to ask, therefore, whether analogous theorems to those in [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten] hold in the case of co-t-structures. This is indeed the case. In this note, we prove the corresponding results for co-t-structures and observe that in the first part of [\cite=Co-t-structures] the hypotheses can be relaxed so that S is a connected corigid object (i.e. [formula] is a division ring is not required) and are, in addition, necessary and sufficient.

Recall from [\cite=Co-t-structures] that a co-t-structure on a triangulated category [formula] is called non-degenerate if [formula]; following [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten] we shall say it is of finite type if [formula] is closed under set indexed coproducts. Consider the following setup.

Recall that an additive category [formula] is called a left triangulated category if it is equipped with an endofunctor [formula] (not necessarily an auto-equivalence) and a class of diagrams ΩZ  →  X  →  Y  →  Z called left triangle which satisfy the axioms of a triangulated category except that the left triangles may only be 'translated' to the left in (TR2). See [\cite=Beligiannis_Marmardis] for details. Right triangulated categories are defined similarly.

Under the assumptions of Setup [\ref=first_setup] we have:

Let [formula] be a full subcategory of a triangulated category [formula]. A morphism φ:X  →  F with [formula] is called a left [formula]-approximation if the induced morphism [formula] is surjective for all [formula]. Dually, one obtains a right [formula]-approximation. Left [formula]-approximations are often called [formula]-preenvelopes and right [formula]-approximations are often called [formula]-precovers. The full subcategory F is called contravariantly (resp., covariantly) finite if any object of [formula] admits a right (resp., left) [formula]-approximation.

[formula] is contravariantly finite in [formula] and for any [formula] there exists a distinguished triangle [formula] in [formula] such that

In [\cite=Bondarko] a co-t-structure [formula] is called left adjacent to a (co)-t-structure [formula] if [formula]; cf. the notion of 'torsion torsion-free triple' in [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten]. The notion of right adjacency is defined analogously.

Consider the homotopy category of spectra [formula] and let [formula] consist of only the sphere spectrum. Then S0 is compact and satisfies the hypotheses of [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten] (see [\cite=Margolis], for instance). Thus it follows that the co-t-structure induced by Theorem [\ref=prop1] is left adjacent to the natural t-structure on [formula].

We next obtain an analogue of [\cite=Beligiannis_Reiten]. We add the following conditions to Setup [\ref=first_setup]:

The construction here is slightly different from that of Theorem [\ref=prop1] and hinges on the following technical lemma.

Under the conditions of Setups [\ref=first_setup] and [\ref=second_setup], for any object X in [formula] there is a left [formula]-approximation β:X  →  B with [formula] such that [formula] is an isomorphism for i < 1 and all [formula].

Under the conditions of Setups [\ref=first_setup] and [\ref=second_setup] we have

[formula]

Moreover, the following statements are equivalent:

In the following example we look at the canonical co-t-structure induced by a connected cochain differential graded algebra (DGA); for details regarding DGAs see [\cite=Bernstein] and [\cite=Felix], also see the motivation presented in [\cite=Co-t-structures]. In particular, note that such DGAs arise naturally as the cochain algebras of (simply) connected CW-complexes; see [\cite=Felix].

Let R be a connected cochain DGA, i.e Hi(R) = 0 for i < 0 and H1(R) = 0, and let [formula] denote its (unbounded) derived category of differential graded (DG) left R-modules. Observe that [formula] for all [formula], thus R clearly satisfies the conditions of Proposition [\ref=prop2], and as such one obtains a co-t-structure on [formula].
