Limit and extended limit sets of matrices in Jordan normal form

Preliminaries and basic notions

Limit and extended limit sets are in the center of interest in the study of dynamics of linear operators. To find them, even in relatively easy cases of operators, it is a difficult task. In this note we describe the limit and the extended limit sets for the simplest case which is the case of a single matrix in Jordan normal form. We use a method similar to the one used by N. H. Kuiper and J. W. Robbin in [\cite=KuRo]. In this work Kuiper and Robbin dealt with the problem of the topological classification of linear endomorphisms and the main tool they used was the extended mixing limit sets of the exponential of the nilpotent part of a Jordan block. In the following we introduce the basic notions we use in the present work.

Let X be a complex Banach space and let T:X  →  X be a bounded linear operator.

For every x∈X the sets

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

denote the limit set, the extended (prolongational) and the extended mixing limit set of x under T respectively.

The notions of the limit and extended limit sets are well known in the theory of topological dynamics, see [\cite=BaSz]. Roughly speaking, we can say that the limit set of a vector x describes the limiting behavior of its orbit and the corresponding extended limit set J(x) describes the asymptotic behavior of all vectors nearby x. Let us see how these notions are connected, at a very first, naive level. To explain, we recall the following definition. A bounded linear operator T:X  →  X acting on a complex separable Banach space X is called hypercyclic if there exists a vector x∈X so that the orbit of x under T, i.e. the set [formula], is dense in X. The last is equivalent with the following property: for every pair (U,V) of non-empty open subsets of X there exists a positive integer n such that [formula]. In the language of topological dynamics an operator having the previous property is called topologically transitive. If in addition for every pair (U,V) of non-empty open subsets of X there exists a positive integer N such that [formula] for every n  ≥  N, then T is called topologically mixing. Using Proposition [\ref=equivdef] it is not difficult to show that T is topologically transitive if and only if J(x) = X for every x∈X and that T is topologically mixing if and only if Jmix(x) = X for every x∈X see [\cite=cosma1]. For several examples of hypercyclic operators and an in depth study of several aspects of the notion of hypercyclicity we refer to the recent books [\cite=BaMa], [\cite=GEPe]. In [\cite=cosma1], we localized the notion of hypercyclicity through the use of J-sets. To recall briefly, we say that a bounded linear operator T acting on a Banach space (not necessarily separable) X is locally topologically transitive or J-class (locally topologically mixing) if there exists a non-zero vector x∈X so that J(x) = X (Jmix(x) = X respectively). Among other things we showed that there are locally hypercyclic, non-hypercyclic operators and that finite dimensional Banach spaces do not admit locally hypercyclic operators. The next proposition, which also appears in [\cite=CosMa], gives a description of J-sets through the use of open sets. To keep the paper shelf contained we present the proof.

An equivalent definition for the sets J(x), Jmix(x) is the following.

[formula]

and

[formula]

We give the proof for the Jmix-sets, the proof for the J-sets is similar.

Let us prove that

[formula]

since the converse inclusion is obvious. Fix a vector

[formula]

Consider the open balls B(x,1 / n),B(y,1 / n) centered at x,y∈X and radius 1 / n for [formula]. Then there exists a strictly increasing sequence {kn} of positive integers such that [formula] for every m  ≥  kn, [formula]. Therefore there exist

[formula]

such that [formula] for every [formula]. In a similar fashion we may find

[formula]

such that [formula] for every [formula]. Proceeding inductively we find a sequence {xn}, n  ≥  k1 such that xn  →  x and Tnxn  →  y. This completes the proof.

Limit sets, extended limit sets and extended mixing limit sets are closed and invariant [\cite=CosMa]. Next proposition will be used later to simplify proofs.

Let T:X  →  X be a bounded linear operator. Then JλT(0) = JT(0) for every |λ| = 1.

Let y∈JλT(0). Then there exist a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers {kn} and a sequence {xn}  ⊂  X such that xn  →  0 and λknTknxn  →  y. Since |λ| = 1 then λknxn  →  0 and since Tkn(λknxn)  →  y it follows that y∈JT(0). Take now a vector y∈JT(0). Then there exist a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers {kn} and a sequence {xn}  ⊂  X such that xn  →  0 and Tknxn  →  y. Since |λ| = 1, without loss of generality we may assume that λkn  →  μ for some |μ| = 1. Hence [formula] and since [formula] then y∈JλT(0).

Limit and extended limit sets of a matrix in Jordan normal form

We mainly focus in the case A is a l  ×  l Jordan block over [formula]. This means that the main diagonal consists of λ's, for some [formula], the diagonal above the main diagonal consists of 1's and all the other entries of the matrix are filled with zeros. We shall then describe the limit and extended limit sets of every [formula] under A. The general case of a matrix in a Jordan canonical form follows easily from the latter case, since we can "glue" the limit and extended limit sets of separate Jordan blocks. Finally, since every complex matrix B is similar to a matrix in Jordan canonical form, we are able to determine the limit and extended limit sets of every [formula] under B. For the rest of this section A will be a l  ×  l Jordan block over [formula].

If A is a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| = 1 and [formula] then [formula] if and only if [formula]. In this case L(x) = {Dx1}  ×  0, where D is the closure of the set {λn}.

If A is a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| > 1 then [formula] for every non-zero vector [formula].

If A is a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| < 1 then L(x) = {0} for every [formula].

(i) We give the proof for the case l = 3. The general case follows easily. Let x = (x1,x2,x3) and y = (y1,y2,y3)∈L(x). Then there exists a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers {kn} such that Aknx  →  y. Setting yn = (yn1,yn2,yn3) = Aknx we get

[formula]

Using the second equation we conclude that x3 = y3 = 0 since the sequences {yn2} and {λknx2} are bounded. So we have the following system of linear equations.

[formula]

Using the same argument for x2 we have x2 = y2 = 0. Hence, the only remaining equation is yn1  =  λknx1 and the proof of the proposition is completed.

The proof of items (i) and (ii) follows easily and is omitted.

In the following we describe the extended limit sets of the zero-vector.

Let A be a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| = 1.

If l = 1 then J(0) = {0}. If l > 1 and l is of the form l = 2r or l = 2r - 1 then [formula].

A point y∈J(0) if and only if there exists a sequence [formula] such that Anxn  →  y, hence J(0) = Jmix(0).

For every linear map [formula] with eigenvalues of modulus 1 the set J(0) is a proper linear subspace of [formula].

We give the proof for the cases l = 3 and l = 4. For the general case we may use the same technics as in [\cite=KuRo]. Since, by Proposition [\ref=scalarA], JλA(0) = JA(0) for every λ of modulus 1 we may assume that λ = 1.

Case l = 3: Let y = ((y1,y2,y3)∈J(0). Then there exist a sequence {xn} in [formula] and a strictly increasing sequence {kn} of positive integers such that xn = (xn1,xn2,xn3)  →  (0,0,0) and Aknxn  →  y. Letting yn = (yn1,yn2,yn3) = Aknxn, then we have

[formula]

Since xn3  →  0 it follows that yn3  →  0, hence y3 = 0. Using the second equation we have [formula]. Therefore dividing the first equation by kn and substitute xn3 we get

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] and xn2 have limit 0 and [formula] then yn2 - xn2  →  0. Since xn2  →  0 it follows that yn2  →  0, therefore y2 = 0. Till now we have proved that [formula]. Next we show the inverse inclusion. Let y = (y1,0,0). We put xn1 = 0, xn2 = 0, yn1 = y1 and then we solve the system of the linear equations. So, we have

[formula]

Now it is easy to check that xn  →  0 and yn  →  y. Note that we have also proved (ii).

Case l = 4: Let y = ((y1,y2,y3,y4)∈J(0). Then there exist a sequence {xn} in [formula] and a strictly increasing sequence {kn} of positive integers such that xn = (xn1,xn2,xn3,xn4)  →  (0,0,0) and Aknxn  →  y. Setting yn = (yn1,yn2,yn3,yn4) = Aknxn we get

[formula]

Observe that the last three equations are exactly the same as in the case where l = 3 hence y3 = y4 = 0. Therefore [formula]. Next we show the inverse inclusion. Let y = (y1,y2,0,0). We put xn1 = 0, xn2 = 0, yn1 = y1, yn2 = y2 and then we solve the system of the linear equations. So, we have

[formula]

Now it is easy to check that xn  →  0 and yn  →  y. Again we have proved simultaneously (ii). Item (iii) is obtained by (i) and (ii), since we can glue the J(0)-sets of the Jordan blocks of B.

Let A be a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| > 1. Then the following hold.

[formula].

For every point [formula] there exists a sequence [formula] such that Anxn  →  y, hence J(0) = Jmix(0).

For every linear map [formula] with eigenvalues of modulus greater than 1 it holds that [formula].

We prove the theorem for the case l = 3. Let y = (y1,y2,y3) and yn = (yn1,yn2,yn3) = Anxn. We put yn1 = y1, yn2 = y2, yn3 = y3 and we solve again the corresponding system of the linear equations:

[formula]

Hence, we have

[formula]

Now it is trivial to check that xn  →  0 and yn  →  y. Note that item (iii) follows by (i) and (ii).

The proof of the next proposition is easy and it is left to the reader.

Let A be a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| < 1. Then the following hold.

J(0) = {0}.

For every linear map [formula] with eigenvalues of modulus less than 1 it holds that J(0) = {0}.

Below we treat the general case.

Let A be a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| = 1 and [formula].

If l = 2r then [formula] if and only if [formula]. In this case [formula].

If l = 2r - 1 then [formula] if and only if [formula]. In this case [formula], where D is the closure of the set {λn}. In case where l = 1, J(x) = {Dx}.

We only consider the case l = 3. Let y = (y1,y2,y3)∈J(x). Then there exist a sequence {zn} in [formula] and a strictly increasing sequence {kn} of positive integers such that zn = (xn1,xn2,xn3)  →  (x1,x2,x3) and Aknzn  →  y. Setting yn = (yn1,yn2,yn3) = Aknzn we get

[formula]

Using the second equation we conclude that xn3  →  0 since the sequences {yn2} and {λknxn2} are bounded. The last implies that x3 = 0. Since

[formula]

and [formula], [formula] we obtain the following

[formula]

Solving the second equation with respect to xn3 and substitute above, we arrive at

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

Since [formula], without loss of generality we may assume that λkn - 1  →  μ for some μ of modulus 1. Then every y = (y1,y2,y3)∈J(x) satisfies the following

[formula]

That is y2∈{Dx2}. Hence, [formula]. Next we show the inverse inclusion. Let y = (y1,y2,0) where y2∈{Dx2}. Hence there exists a sequence of the form {λkn} such that λkn - 1  →    -  μ for some μ of modulus 1 and λknx2  →  y2. Hence, y2  +  λμx2 = 0. Setting yn1 = y1, xn1 = x1, xn2 = x2 we solve again the corresponding system of the linear equations. Therefore

[formula]

since xn3  →  x3 = 0 and this finishes the proof of the theorem.

Let A be a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| > 1.

If x  ≠  0 then [formula].

If x = 0 then [formula].

We give the proof for the case l = 3. Let y = (y1,y2,y3)∈J(x) for some [formula]. Then there exist a sequence {zn} in [formula] and a strictly increasing sequence {kn} of positive integers such that zn = (xn1,xn2,xn3)  →  (x1,x2,x3) and Aknzn  →  y. Set yn = (yn1,yn2,yn3) = Aknzn. Since yn3  =  λknxn3  →  y3 then kn(kn - 1)xn3  →  0. From yn2  →  y2 we get

[formula]

Using the fact that λknxn3  →  y3 it follows that the sequence [formula] converges to a finite complex number, hence knxn2  →  0. The last implies xn2  →  0, therefore x2 = 0. We have

[formula]

Observing that each one term on the right hand side in the previous equality goes to 0 (yn3  →  y3) we arrive at x1 = 0. Therefore x = 0. Hence by Theorem [\ref=jzerogreater], [formula].

The proof of the next proposition is trivial and therefore is omitted.

If A is a Jordan block with an eigenvalue |λ| < 1 then J(x) = {0} for every [formula].

As we have already mentioned in the introduction, hypercyclicity is a phenomenon which occurs in infinite dimensions. However, as Feldman showed in [\cite=Fel], there exist n  ×  n commuting complex matrices [formula] and vectors [formula] such that the set

[formula]

is dense in [formula]. For results towards this direction see also [\cite=CoHaMa1]. Now in a similar manner as above, one can define the extended limit set of a vector [formula] associated to a fixed finite set of (commuting) matrices. For precise definitions we refer to [\cite=CoHaMa2]. A quite demanding question is the following

Question. Fix k,n  ≥  2 positive integers. Let [formula] be n  ×  n commuting complex matrices. Describe the J-set [formula] for every [formula].
