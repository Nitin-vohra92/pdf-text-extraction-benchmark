Keywords: Cuntz algebra, automorphism, MASA, UHF-subalgebra, shift, shift automorphism, shift endomorphism

Introduction

Investigations of endomorphisms of the simple C*-algebras On, [\cite=Cun1], were initiated by Cuntz in his seminal paper [\cite=Cun2]. A key tool for those investigations was provided by a fairly simple observation that unital endomorphisms of On are in an explicit bijective correspondence with unitary elements of this C*-algebra. In particular, Cuntz studied the subgroup of automorphisms of On which globally preserve the canonical diagonal MASA Dn. He showed that the quotient of this group by its normal subgroup consisting of those automorphisms which fix Dn point-wise (and this is a maximal abelian subgroup of [formula]) is discrete. It is natural to think of this quotient as an analogue of the Weyl group. The Weyl group contains a natural interesting subgroup corresponding to those automorphisms which also globally preserve the core UHF-subalgebra Fn of On. Cuntz proposed in [\cite=Cun2] a problem of determining the structure of this restricted Weyl group.

Ever since, endomorphisms of On have been an active area of investigations both intrinsically and in connection to many other areas. Not even attempting any exhausting overview of the relevant literature, let us only mention two pieces of research which influenced our current study the most: Conti-Pinzari work on Jones index for endomorphisms of On, [\cite=CP], and Bratteli-Jørgensen work on iterated function systems and representations of Cuntz algebras, initiated in [\cite=BJ1] and [\cite=BJ2]. More recently, quite significant progress has been achieved in the study of those endomorphisms which preserve either the core UHF-subalgebra, [\cite=CRS], or the diagonal MASA, [\cite=HSS]. A powerful, novel combinatorial approach to the study of endomorphisms which globally preserve both Fn and Dn has been developed in [\cite=S], [\cite=CS] and [\cite=CKS].

The main result of this paper is an explicit and intrinsic description of the restricted Weyl group of the Cuntz algebra On and its image in the outer automorphism group [formula] (which we call the restricted outer Weyl group of On). The way we achieve this is by analyzing the action of the restricted Weyl group on the diagonal MASA, and by showing that certain class of automorphisms of Dn admits extensions to permutative automorphisms of On (and thus also of Fn). In general, existence of such extensions is not guaranteed, as demonstrated by [\cite=Co]. It turns out that the restricted outer Weyl group admits a natural embedding into the group of shift automorphisms of the two-sided full shift (with the mod out center), and for prime n this embedding is actually an isomorphism. These facts have profound implications. For example, they immediately imply that the restricted outer Weyl group is residually finite. For n = 2, this result also provides a not unexpected answer to a question left open in [\cite=CS]. Namely, the restricted outer Weyl group is not amenable (for n  ≥  3 this was already shown earlier in [\cite=S] and [\cite=CS]). It also follows from our results that the restricted Weyl group of On is big enough to contain a copy of the group of shift automorphisms of the one-sided full n-shift. The groups of shift automorphisms (both for the one-sided and the two-sided shift) have been extensively studied in the literature as they reveal an intriguing and highly nontrivial structure, see [\cite=K] [\cite=LM] and the literature cited therein.

One important outcome of our investigations is a powerful and neat link between two areas: the study of automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras and symbolic dynamics. This kind of interaction was pioneered by Cuntz and Krieger in [\cite=CK], but we believe its limits have not been reached yet. On one hand, we expect that the nice results available in the literature on symbolic dynamics could shed new light on some aspects of automorphisms of Cuntz algebras, and possibly even more general classes of C*-algebras. But perhaps it is even more intriguing to speculate the other way round, as one could hope that the algebraic environment that we unveil could provide new tools and insight for attacking some of the problems in the dynamical systems setting.

Notation and preliminaries

If n is an integer greater than 1, then the Cuntz algebra On is a unital, simple, purely infinite C*-algebra generated by n isometries [formula], satisfying [formula], [\cite=Cun1]. We denote by Wkn the set of k-tuples [formula] with [formula], and by Wn the union [formula], where W0n  =  {0}. We call elements of Wn multi-indices. If μ∈Wkn then |μ|  =  k is the length of μ. If [formula], then [formula] (S0  =  1 by convention) is an isometry with range projection Pμ = SμS*μ. Every word in [formula] can be uniquely expressed as SμS*ν, for μ,ν∈Wn [\cite=Cun1].

We denote by Fkn the C*-subalgebra of On spanned by all words of the form SμS*ν, μ,ν∈Wkn, which is isomorphic to the matrix algebra [formula]. The norm closure Fn of [formula], is the UHF-algebra of type n∞, called the core UHF-subalgebra of On, [\cite=Cun1]. It is the fixed point algebra for the gauge action of the circle group [formula] defined on generators as γt(Si) = tSi. For [formula], we denote by O(k)n: = {x∈On:γt(x) = tkx}, the spectral subspace for this action. In particular, Fn  =  O(0)n. The C*-subalgebra of Fn generated by projections Pμ, μ∈Wn, is a MASA (maximal abelian subalgebra) both in Fn and in On. We call it the diagonal and denote Dn. The spectrum of Dn is naturally identified with Xn -- the full one-sided n-shift space. We also set [formula]. Throughout this paper we are interested in the inclusions

[formula]

The UHF-subalgebra Fn posseses a unique normalized trace, denoted τ. We will refer to the restriction of τ to Dn as to the canonical trace on Dn.

We denote by Sn the group of those unitaries in On which can be written as finite sums of words, i.e., in the form [formula] for some μj,νj∈Wn. We also denote [formula]. Then [formula], where Pkn are permutation unitaries in U(Fkn). That is, for each u∈Pkn there is a unique permutation σ of multi-indices Wkn such that

[formula]

As shown by Cuntz in [\cite=Cun2], there exists the following bijective correspondence between unitaries in On and unital *  -endomorphisms of On (whose collection we denote by [formula]). A unitary u in On determines an endomorphism λu by

[formula]

Conversely, if ρ:On  →  On is an endomorphism, then [formula] gives a unitary u∈On such that ρ  =  λu. If the unitary u arises from a permutation σ via the formula [\eqref=permutunitary], the corresponding endomorphism will be sometimes denoted by λσ. Composition of endomorphisms corresponds to a 'convolution' multiplication of unitaries as follows:

[formula]

We denote by φ the canonical shift:

[formula]

If we take [formula] then φ  =  λu. It is well-known that φ leaves invariant both Fn and Dn, and that φ commutes with the gauge action γ. We denote by φ the standard left inverse of φ, defined as [formula].

If u∈U(On) then for each positive integer k we denote

[formula]

We agree that u*k stands for (uk)*. If α and β are multi-indices of length k and m, respectively, then λu(SαS*β) = ukSαS*βu*m. This is established through a repeated application of the identity Sia  =  φ(a)Si, valid for all [formula] and a∈On. If u∈Fkn for some k then, following [\cite=CP], we call endomorphism λu localized.

For algebras A  ⊆  B we denote by NB(A) = {u∈U(B):uAu* = A} the normalizer of A in B and by [formula] the relative commutant of A in B. We also denote by [formula] the collection of all those automorphisms α of B that α(A) = A, and by [formula] those automorphisms of B which fix A point-wise.

The restricted Weyl group of the Cuntz algebra

Let α be an automorphism of Dn. We denote by α* the corresponding homeomorphism of Xn. We say that α has property (P) if there exists m such that for all k  ≥  m we have

[formula]

for all x∈D1n. That is, α eventually commutes with the shift. Equivalently, [formula] satisfies (P) with m if the endomorphism αφm commutes with the shift φ. We define

[formula]

[formula] is a subgroup of [formula].

Proof. Let α and β belong to [formula]. Take m so large that both α and β satisfy (P) with m. Also, let r be so large that β(φm(D1n)) is contained in Drn. Since [formula], there exist linear functionals [formula], μ∈Wrn, such that

[formula]

Thus for k  ≥  2m and x∈D1n we have

[formula]

since

[formula]

by virtue of ([\ref=betam]) and property (P) for β. Consequently, the product αβ satisfies (P) with 2m, and whence [formula] is a group. [formula]

We denote [formula]. This is a normal subgroup of [formula], since for u∈Pkn we have [formula]. In what follows we agree that [formula].

If [formula] then [formula] if and only if there exist m,k such that αφm  =  φk.

Proof. Let [formula] and let m,k be such that αφm  =  φk. Suppose first that m  ≥  k. Then αφm - k(x) = x for all x∈φk(Dn). Let r  ≥  k be so large that αφm - k(Dkn)  ⊆  Drn. Since Drn  =  Dknφk(Dr - kn) and αφm - k acts identically on φk(Dr - kn), it follows that αφm - k(Drn)  ⊆  Drn. Since the map is injective and the space finite dimensional, we have αφm - k(Drn) = Drn. As αφm - k acts identically on φr(Dn), it follows that there is a permutation unitary u∈Prn such that [formula]. In particular, αφm - k is an automorphism of Dn. Thus m - k = 0 and hence [formula]. If m  ≤  k then α- 1φk  =  φm and we argue in the same way. This proves one implication. The other one is obvious. [formula]

If [formula] then there exists [formula] such that αφ  =  βφα and β(x) = α(x) for all x∈D1n.

Proof. Given x∈Dn, there exist unique elements [formula] in Dn such that [formula]. We define

[formula]

It follows that β is an automorphism of Dn satisfying the required braiding property. [formula]

If [formula] and [formula] is defined by formula ([\ref=beta]) then we call β the braiding automorphism for α.

As shown in [\cite=S], if u∈Pn and λu is an automorphism of On then the restriction of λu to Dn belongs to [formula]. This can be further generalized, as follows.

Let [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

α- 1 has property (P);

there exists a permutation u∈Pn such that α  =  λu|Dn.

In this case, α extends to an endomorphism of Fn and both α and α- 1 are τ-preserving.

Proof. (2) ⇒   (1): By assumption, α can be written as lim h  →    ∞Ad(uh) (pointwise norm limit) and therefore α- 1  =   lim h  →    ∞Ad(uh)*. Now, if u∈Prn, one has, for all k - 1  ≥  r and all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n,

[formula]

(1) ⇒   (2): At first we observe that there exists a permutation unitary u∈Pn such that the braiding automorphism for α is of the form [formula]. Indeed, let α- 1 satisfy (P) with m. Since α- 1φm + 1  =  φα- 1φm, we have φm + 1  =  αφα- 1φm  =  βφm + 1. Therefore, there exists a permutation unitary u∈Pn such that [formula], by Lemma [\ref=amk].

Now we verify that the unitary u as above satisfies α  =  λu|Dn. Note that, by induction, αφk  =  (βφ)kα for all k. Therefore, [formula] for all k. In particular, [formula] for all k and i. Now we compute

[formula]

That is, α  =  λu|Dn, as required.

If the above conditions are satisfied, then in particular α extends to an endomorphism λu|Fn of Fn, Thus τλu|Fn  =  τ by uniqueness of trace on Fn (or the fact that λu|Fn is a point-wise limit of inner automorphisms). Hence τα  =  τ as well. This clearly implies also that τα- 1  =  τ. [formula]

The preceding theorem provides a dynamical explanation of the puzzling phenomenon observed in [\cite=CS] through combinatorial arguments, namely the coexistence of permutative automorphisms and proper endomorphisms of On restricting to automorphisms of the diagonal, in the form of a different dynamics they induce on Xn.

The following proposition is yet another slight generalization of [\cite=S]. We omit the proof.

Let λu be a localized automorphism of On. Then, there exists some nonnegative integer m such that, for all k  ≥  m and all x∈F1n,

[formula]

If [formula] then there exists a permutation unitary u∈Pn such that α  =  λu|Dn. If w is any unitary in On such that λw|Dn  =  α, then [formula].

Proof. The first statement follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=asym]. Let w∈U(On) be such that λw|Dn  =  α. Then, by the same argument, there exists a permutation unitary v∈Pn such that λv|Dn  =  α- 1. Thus λwλv is an endomorphism of On acting identically on Dn, and consequently [formula] by [\cite=Co]. [formula]

Each [formula] can be extended to an automorphism of Fn.

By Theorem [\ref=asym], the restriction [formula] yields a group embedding [formula], see [\cite=Cun2] [\cite=CS]. Since the restriction map [formula] is injective on λ(Pn)- 1, [\cite=Cun2] [\cite=CS], Theorem [\ref=extendingautos] yields the following.

The restriction [formula] is a group isomorphism.

We recall from [\cite=Cun2] that [formula] is the normalizer of [formula] in [formula] and it can be also described as the group λ(NOn(Dn))- 1 of automorphisms of On induced by elements in the (unitary) normalizer NOn(Dn). Furthermore, using [\cite=Pow], one can show that [formula] has the structure of a semidirect product [formula] [\cite=CS]. In particular, the group λ(Pn)- 1 is isomorphic with the quotient of the group [formula] by its normal subgroup [formula]. We call it the restricted Weyl group of On, cf. [\cite=Cun2] [\cite=CS]. Thus, the preceding corollary provides in a sense an answer to the question raised by Cuntz in [\cite=Cun2].

Let u∈Sn be such that λu(Dn) = Dn and [formula]. Then u∈Pn.

Proof. By Theorem [\ref=extendingautos], there is w∈Pn such that λw(x) = λu(x) for all x∈Dn. However, the restriction map [formula] is injective, [\cite=Cun2] [\cite=CS]. Thus u = w belongs to Pn. [formula]

The restricted outer Weyl group of the Cuntz algebra and shift endomorphisms

Denote by [formula] the normal subgroup of λ(Pn)- 1 consisting of all inner permutative automorphisms [formula]. We call the quotient [formula] the restricted outer Weyl group of On. From Theorem [\ref=extendingautos], we get the following.

The restricted outer Weyl group of On is naturally isomorphic to the quotient [formula].

In what follows, if [formula] then we denote its class in [formula] by [formula]. We denote by [formula] the semigroup of unital, injective *  -homomorphisms from Dn into itself which commute with the shift. We define En as the collection of all those [formula] for which there exists an m and a [formula] such that

[formula]

In such a case, we have αβα  =  φmα  =  αφm, and thus injectivity of α implies that βα  =  φm as well. In particular, β itself belongs to En. En is a subsemigroup of [formula] containing all powers of φ, [formula], as well as all endomorphisms αφm with [formula] and suitably large m.

We note that if α∈En then α*:Xn  →  Xn is an open mapping. Indeed, if U  ⊆  Xn is open then so is V = β- 1*(U), and U = β*(V) since β* is surjective. Then α*(U) = α*β*(V) = φm*(V) is open, since φm* is an open mapping.

If α∈En then α* acts bijectively on periodic words. Consequently, τα(d) = τ(d) for all d∈Dn.

Proof. Say x∈Xn has period r if φr*(x) = x. For each r, the set Xn(r) of all points with period r is finite. Furthermore, φ* restricts to a bijection on each Xn(r). If μ∈Wn and r  ≥  |μ| then there are exactly nr - |μ| words x∈Xn(r) such that Pμ(x) = 1.

Now let α be in En, and let β∈En be such that ([\ref=phiinverse]) holds. For each r we have α*(Xn(r))  ⊆  Xn(r), since α* commutes with φ*. If x,y∈Xn(r) and α*(x) = α*(y) then also φm*(x) = β*α*(x) = β*α*(y) = φm*(y). Thus x = y, since φ* acts bijectively on Xn(r). Therefore, α* yields a one-to-one mapping from Xn(r) to itself. By finiteness of Xn(r), this map is bijective.

Now let μ∈Wn and let [formula]. By subdividing, if necessary, we may assume that each μj is of the same length r and that r  ≥  |μ|. Then the number of words x∈Xn(r) such that Pμ(x) = 1 is the same as the number of words y∈Xn(r) such that Pμj(y) = 1 for some j. Thus k = nr - |μ|, and consequently

[formula]

Since μ was arbitrary, the proposition follows. [formula]

The following lemma is due to Mike Boyle, [\cite=Boy], although the proof given below is our own.

If α∈En then there exists a k such that the mapping α* is k-to-one. This k divides a power of n. Thus if n is prime then there exists an r such that α* is nr-to-one.

Proof. Let α,β∈En satisfy ([\ref=phiinverse]). Since β*α*  =  φm* is nm-to-one, each y∈Xn has at most nm inverse images under α*. Let k be the minimal cardinality of α- 1*(y), and let ω∈Xn be such that α- 1* has exactly k elements. Then the set α- 1*(φ- 1*(ω)) = φ- 1*(α- 1*(ω) has nk elements. By the minimality of k, this can only happen if each element of φ- 1*(ω) has k inverse images under α*. Let Ω be the smallest subset of Xn containing ω and closed under taking inverse images of φ*. It follows from the above that for each y∈Ω the set α- 1*(y) has k elements. Clearly, Ω is dense in Xn. Now let y∈Xn be arbitrary, and let α- 1*(y) have k' elements. Since α* is an open mapping, there exists an open subset V of Xn containing y whose each element has at least k' inverse images under α*. Since [formula], we have k' = k.

Applying the same reasoning to β instead of α we get an l such that β* is l-to-one. Thus kl = nm. [formula]

We define an equivalence relation ~   in En as follows: α  ~  β if there exists a k such that either α  =  βφk or αφk  =  β. Then we set

[formula]

By construction, [formula] is a group. If α∈En then we denote its class in [formula] by [formula]. Let [formula] denote the group of automorphisms of the full two-sided n-shift, and let 〈σ〉 be its subgroup generated by the two-sided shift σ. The following proposition is well-known, but for completeness we include a proof.

The groups [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic.

Proof. We can realize Dn as [formula]. Likewise, we consider [formula], equipped with the two-sided shift automorphism [formula]. The Gelfand spectrum of [formula] can be identified with Σn and the canonical embedding [formula] corresponds to the canonical surjection Σn  →  Xn.

Now, every shift invariant endomorphism ρ of Dn canonically extends to an endomorphism [formula] of [formula], uniquely determined by the properties of being [formula]-invariant and restricting to ρ on [formula]. Of course, the shift endomorphism φ extends to [formula]. If ρ is injective then [formula] is injective too. Moreover, the map ρ  ↦   gives a semigroup homomorphism from End(Dn,φ) to [formula], which is clearly injective.

If ρ∈En then it is easy to see that [formula] is surjective and thus it is an automorphism of [formula]. Therefore, we get an injective semigroup homomorphism [formula]. Passing to quotients, the previous map provides a well-defined and injective group homomorphism from [formula] into [formula].

In order to show surjectivity of this map, we observe that given any [formula]-commuting automorphism η of [formula] there exists a nonnegative integer k such that [formula] belongs to En (use the fact that Σn is the Cantor set). Furthermore, thanks to uniqueness of the extension, one has [formula] and the proof is complete. [formula]

There exists an embedding of [formula] into [formula]. If n is prime then these two groups are isomorphic.

Proof. By virtue of Proposition [\ref=quotientiso], we may replace [formula] with [formula].

Let [formula] satisfy (P) with m. Then αφm∈En, and we map α to [formula] in [formula]. Clearly, this definition does not depend on the choice of m and thus the map is well defined. One easily checks that this map is a group homomorphism. If [formula] then αφk  =  φk for sufficiently large k, and thus the image of such α in [formula] is the trivial element. Thus, the homomorphism [formula] factors though [formula], and we get a homomorphism [formula]. The latter map is injective. Indeed, let [formula] satisfy (P) with m and [formula]. Then there is a k such that either [formula] or αφm  =  φk. In either case, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=amk].

Now assuming n prime we show that the map [formula] is surjective. Let α∈En and let β∈En be such that identity ([\ref=phiinverse]) holds. There is an r such that α* is nr-to-one, by Lemma [\ref=boyle]. Since α* is an open map onto the Cantor set it admits a continuous section f1, [\cite=M]. Space [formula] being open is completely metrizable and thus the restriction of α* to [formula] admits a section f2. Continuing in this manner, we arrive at a maximal set of independent, continuous sections. For convinience, we label these sections with words from Wrn. That is, there exist continuous functions fμ:Xn  →  Xn, μ∈Wrn, such that [formula] and α- 1*(x) = {fμ(x):μ∈Wrn} for each x∈Xn. Define a mapping g:Xn  →  Xn by g(μx) = fμ(x). Then g is a homeomorphism of Xn. Furthermore, we have α*g(μx)  =  α*fμ(x)  =  x  =  φr*(μx). Thus α*g  =  φr* and hence α*  =  φr*g- 1. Let [formula] be such that ψ* = g- 1. Then α  =  ψφr and whence ψ satisfies condition (P). Arguing in the same way, we obtain an [formula] such that β  =  ηφt for some t. Then φm  =  αβ  =  ψηφr + t. Thus [formula] by Lemma [\ref=amk]. Now ψ- 1 being a composition of η and an element from [formula], itself satisfies condition (P). Consequently, ψ belongs to [formula]. Clearly, the homomorphism [formula] maps [formula] to [formula], and the proof is complete. [formula]

In view of the preceding theorem, the restricted outer Weyl group of On has a number of striking properties known to hold for [formula], see [\cite=K] [\cite=LM] and the references therein. This is immediate at least for n prime. For example, we now know that in the case of n = 2 the group [formula] is non-amenable (for [formula] this has been already observed in [\cite=S] [\cite=CS]). We wonder if the extensive theory of shift automorphisms could not bring new insight into the structural properties of not just Cuntz algebras but also graph algebras and possibly even a larger class of C*-algebras. In particular, it appears to be an intriguing possibility of translating some features of the beautiful analysis of the action of automorphisms on periodic points, [\cite=BK], into a more algebraic setting.

In general, when n is not prime, the embedding from Theorem [\ref=endogroup] is not surjective. This is due to existence of factorizations φ  =  αβ with α,β∈En and neither α nor β being an automorphism, [\cite=BM]. Then it is easy to verify that [formula], [formula] do not belong to the range of the embedding. Nevertheless, even for n not a prime, Theorem [\ref=endogroup] sheds a lot of light on the structure of the restricted outer Weyl group of On. In particular, it implies that [formula] is residually finite. As an example, we give an elementary, self-contained proof of the fact that [formula] is residually finite in Proposition [\ref=rf] below.

The group [formula] is residually finite.

Proof. Let [formula] denote the set of periodic points in Xn. If α∈En then α* acts bijectively on [formula], Lemma [\ref=shifttrace]. Thus the group [formula] acts on the orbits of [formula] under the action of φ*. The restriction of this action to the orbits contained in Xn(r) yields a homomorphism from [formula] into a finite permutation group. Thus it suffices to show that if α∈En is not a power of the shift then α* moves at least one orbit.

Let α∈En. Suppose that α* fixes every orbit of periodic points under the action of the shift. This means that for each periodic point x there exists k such that α*(x) = φk*(x). We claim that α is a power of the shift. The proof involves the following five steps.

1. There is a map a:Wrn  →  W1n such that if y = α*(x) then [formula], [\cite=H].

2. If [formula] then [formula], for otherwise [formula] would be moved by α*, being a fixed point for φ*.

3. Let Z be the set of all periodic points of the following form:

[formula]

where t > 2r, the number of w's (in one block) is d > t, and [formula]. Note that Z is dense in Xn. By hypothesis on α*, the image under α* of such a periodic point from Z is of the form:

[formula]

However, the former is impossible since [formula] and t > r. Furthermore, there is a k in [formula] such that xk  ≠  w, for otherwise [formula], contrary to the assumption. Consequently, 1  ≤  p  ≤  2r - 1.

4. By 3. above, for each x∈Z there is a 0  ≤  p  ≤  2r - 2 such that α*(x)  =  φp*(x). Now let x be an arbitrary point in Xn. Take a sequence xk∈Z converging to x. Passing to a subsequence we may assume that there is a fixed p  ≤  2r - 2 such that for each k we have α*(xk) = φp*(xk). By continuity, α*(x) = φp*(x).

5. For [formula] let Yj  =  {x∈Xn:α*(x) = φj*(x)}. By 4. above, [formula], and each Yj is a closed set. Thus there is j such that Yj contains a non-empty open subset. Then there exists a finite word μ such that for all infinite words x we have μx∈Yj and α*(μx) = φj*(μx). Since α* commutes with φ*, we have

[formula]

Since x was arbitrary, α*  =  φj*. [formula]

Shift automorphisms

Note that if [formula] satisfies (P) with m = 0 then α* is just an automorphism of the full one-sided n-shift (see [\cite=K]). The collection of all such automorphisms constitutes a subgroup of [formula], which we denote [formula]. In the case of n = 2 we have [formula] (generated by the restriction of Archbold's flip-flop, [\cite=Ar]) by [\cite=K]. But for [formula] the group [formula] is infinite (see [\cite=K] and [\cite=BFK] [\cite=H]).

Consider an order two automorphism α of D3 such that α* changes subwords 13 and 23 (of any one-sided infinite word) into 23 and 13, respectively, as in [\cite=K]. Then α belongs to [formula]. Define

[formula]

an order two permutation unitary in P23. We have

[formula]

One checks that the unitary u commutes with the three minimal projections in φ(uD13u*). This implies (via an easy inductive argument) that the restriction of λu to D3 commutes with the shift φ. It follows that α  =  λu|D3. [formula]

We note, in passing, that among the three rooted trees associated with automorphism λu from Example [\ref=Kitchensexample] as in [\cite=CS], two are of height 2 and one is of height 1 (cf. [\cite=CKS]).

By Theorem [\ref=extendingautos], we already know that each [formula] may be extended to an automorphism of On. Below, we provide an alternative proof of this fact, involving a thourough description of the underlying structure in this specific case and thus leading to a more explicit construction of the required permutation unitary. We will need the following two lemmas. A straightforward proof of the former is omitted.

Let [formula]. If u is a unitary in On such that uxu*  =  α(x) for all x∈D1n and uφj(α(x))u*  =  φj(α(x)) for all x∈D1n and all [formula] then ukxu*k  =  α(x) for all x∈Dkn.

Each [formula] commutes with the left-inverse φ of φ.

Proof. Choose r so large that α(D1n)  ⊆  Drn. We write [formula], where W(j)  ⊆  Wrn is a subset of cardinality nr - 1, since τα  =  τ by Lemma [\ref=shifttrace]. Clearly, the sets [formula] form a partition of Wrn.

Since α commutes with the shift φ, in order to show that α commutes with its left inverse φ it suffices to prove that [formula] for all [formula]. This is equivalent to [formula]. Now the last claim will follow if we can show that [formula] for all [formula] and all j. But the last expression is different from 0 if and only if [formula] is, and this is clearly the case. [formula]

Let α be an automorphism of the full one-sided n-shift, i.e. [formula]. Then there exists a permutation unitary u∈Pn such that α  =  λu|Dn.

Proof. Let [formula], as in Lemma [\ref=phicommute]. Then [formula], for every [formula]. Therefore, there exists a unique u∈Prn such that uPμu*  =  Pμ(j) for all μ∈Wrn, where μ1  =  j and μ(j) is the unique multi-index in W(j) such that

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that the conditions of Lemma [\ref=shiftext] are satisfied (for arbitrarily large k), and hence λu|Dn  =  α. [formula]

All the permutation unitaries u∈Prn as in the preceeding theorem have the following general structure: there are n functions [formula] from Wr - 1n into W1n such that for each w∈Wr - 1n the map j  ↦  fj(w) is a permutation of W1n, and moreover for all μ∈Wrn, uPμu* = Pσf(μ), where [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

If [formula] is a non-trivial automorphism of the full one-sided n-shift and α̃ is an automorphism of On extending α, then α̃ is outer.

Proof. Suppose [formula] for some u∈U(On). Then u∈NOn(Dn) and thus u = vw, where v∈Sn and w∈U(Dn), [\cite=Pow]. But [formula] acts identically on Dn. Thus [formula]. Since τα  =  τ, we must have v∈Pkn for some k. But then [formula] for all x∈Dn. Thus v = 1 and consequently [formula]. [formula]

We have shown, above, that every automorphism of Dn commuting with the shift extends to an automorphism of On. In this subsection we observe that in most cases such an extension cannot commute with the shift φ.

Let λv be an endomorphism of On. Then λv commutes with φ on On if and only if

[formula]

where θ is the flip unitary. If moreover [formula] then λvφ  =  φλv if and only if v∈U(F1n), i.e. λv is a Bogolubov automorphism of On.

Proof. The first statement follows easily from the composition rule of endomorphisms and the fact that φ  =  λθ, where θ∈F2n.

Since λvφ  =  Ad(v)φλv for all unitaries v∈U(On), the assumption implies that Ad(v)φλv(x)  =  φλv(x) for all x∈On and thus, λv being an automorphism, [formula]. [formula]

Let u∈U(On) and suppose that λu(Fn) = Fn. If λu and φ commute on Fn then λu is a Bogolubov automorphism.

Proof. Observe that indeed u∈Fn [\cite=CRS]. By a similar argument as in the previous proposition, we get Ad(u)φλu  =  φλu on Fn and therefore [formula]. [formula]

In the case n = 2, if u is a permutation for which [formula] commutes with φ on D2 then u must be the flip automorphism, i.e. Bogolubov permutation. (And then, in turn, λu commutes with φ on the whole of O2.) However Example [\ref=Kitchensexample] illustrates that this is not true anymore for Dn with n > 2, i.e. there are permutation automorphisms λu (which therefore satisfy automatically λu(Dn) = Dn) commuting with φ on Dn which are not Bogolubov (and thus, by the above proposition, they do not commute with φ on Fn, let alone on On).
