Separability criteria for several classes of n-partite quantum states

Introduction

Quantum entanglement is a kind of new resources beyond the classical resources, and has widely been applied to quantum communication [\cite=Ekert91] [\cite=BBCJPWteleportation93] [\cite=BBM92] [\cite=LoChau] [\cite=YZEPJB05] [\cite=GYJPA05] and quantum computation [\cite=RB] [\cite=BD]. Whether a state is entangled or not is one of the most challenging open problems. For the states of 2  ×  2 and 2  ×  3 bipartite systems, they are separable iff they are positive partial transposition (PPT) [\cite=PeresPPT] [\cite=HorodeckiPPT]. For high dimensional and multipartite systems, however, the situation is significantly more complicated, as several inequivalent classes of multiparticle entanglement exist and it is difficult to decide to which class a given state belongs.

It would be desirable to have useful criteria that allow us to detect the different classes of multipartite entanglement directly from a given density matrix. Gühne and Seevinck [\cite=GuhneNJP2010] presented a method to derive separability criteria for different classes of 3-qubit and 4-qubit entanglement, especially genuine 3-qubit and 4-qubit entanglement. Huber et al. [\cite=MarcusPRL2010] developed a general framework to identify genuinely multipartite entangled mixed quantum states in arbitrary-dimensional systems. Based on the framework, k-separability criterion was derived in [\cite=ABMarcus1002.2953].

In this paper, the separability of n-partite and multilevel quantum states from elements of density matrices is investigated. We derive simple algebraic tests, which are necessary conditions for separability of n-partite quantum states. Some of them are also sufficient conditions for genuine entanglement of n-qubit and n-qudit quantum states. One of the resulting criteria is necessary and sufficient for a certain family of n-partite states.

An n-partite pure state [formula] is called biseparable if there is a bipartition [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] is the state of particles [formula], [formula] is the state of particles [formula], and [formula]. An n-partite mixed state ρ is biseparable if it can be written as a convex combination of biseparable pure states

[formula]

where |ψi〉 might be biseparable under different partitions. If an n-partite state is not biseparable, then it is called genuinely n-partite entangled. Genuine n-partite entanglement is very important as one usually aims to generate and verify this class of entanglement in experiments [\cite=GuhnePhysRep09]. We mainly discuss entanglement criteria for this type of entanglement. An n-partite pure state is fully separable if it is of the form

[formula]

and an n-partite mixed state is fully separable if it is a mixture of fully separable pure states

[formula]

where the pi forms a probability distribution, and |ψi〉 is fully separable. We also consider separability criteria of biseparable and fully separable n-qubit and n-qudit states, and give clear and complete proof of each criterion from general partition by using the Cauchy inequality and Hölder inequality.

The separability criteria of biseparable n-partite states and genuine n-partite entangled states

Let ρ be a density matrix describing an n-particle system, whose state space is Hilbert space [formula], where dimHl = dl, [formula]. We denote its entries by ρi,j, where [formula].

Next we investigate biseparable n-partite states and genuine n-partite entangled states.

Theorem 1 (Gühne and Seevinck [\cite=GuhneNJP2010]) For any n-qubit density matrix, ρ = (ρi,j)2n  ×  2n, if it is biseparable, then

[formula]

That is, if the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable]) does not hold, then ρ is a genuine n-qubit entangled state.

Proof. First we show that ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable]) holds for pure state.

Suppose that ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ| is an n-qubit pure biseparable state under the [formula] partition, and

[formula]

then

[formula]

where [formula]. From

[formula]

one has

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] for [formula]. Thus, ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable]) holds for pure state ρ.

Next we prove that the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable]) is also right for mixed states.

Suppose that

[formula]

is biseparable n-qubit state, where ρ(i) = |ψi〉〈ψi| is biseparable. Simple algebra and the Cauchy inequality [formula] show that

[formula]

The proof is complete.

The same result in this theorem has also been derived in [\cite=GuhneNJP2010]. Gühne and Seevinck [\cite=GuhneNJP2010] proved the cases of n = 3,4. Here starting from general bipartition for n-qubit pure states and applying the Cauchy inequality, we give a proof for any n-qubit states.

Moreover, for n-partite and high dimension system, we have:

Theorem 2   Suppose that n-partite density matrix [formula], dimHl = dl, [formula]. If ρ is biseparable, then

[formula]

where [formula]. Of course, ρ is a genuine n-partite entangled state if it violates the above inequality ([\ref=n-partite-biseparable]).

Proof. Suppose that ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ| is a biseparable pure state under the [formula] partition, and

[formula]

then

[formula]

Here the sum is over all possible values of [formula], i.e., [formula], dn + 1 = 1, and [formula].

Since

[formula]

these give

[formula]

Thus, ([\ref=n-partite-biseparable]) holds for pure state ρ.

Next we prove that the inequality ([\ref=n-partite-biseparable]) is also right for mixed states.

Suppose that

[formula]

is a biseparable n-partite mixed state, where ρ(i) = |ψi〉〈ψi| is biseparable. With the help of ([\ref=n-partite-biseparable]) for pure states ρ(i) and the Cauchy inequality [formula], there is

[formula]

as required.

Ineqs. ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable]) and ([\ref=n-partite-biseparable]) can also be obtained from inequality (II) in Ref.[\cite=MarcusPRL2010] when [formula] and [formula], respectively. Here we give different proofs.

For n-qubit states, there is:

Theorem 3   Let ρ be an n-qubit state. If ρ is biseparable, then its matrix entries fulfill

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

If n-qubit state ρ does not satisfy the above inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable-1]) or ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable-2]), then ρ is genuine n-partite entangled.

Proof.   We begin with pure state. Suppose that ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ|, where [formula], [formula]. For any 1  ≤  j < i  ≤  n, it is not difficult to prove that

[formula]

in the case either i,j∈A or i,j∈B, and

[formula]

in the case one of i and j in A while another in B (either i∈A, j∈B, or i∈B, j∈A). Here [formula] and [formula]. Combining ([\ref=n-q-b-pure-1]) and ([\ref=n-q-b-pure-2]) gives that

[formula]

that is, ([\ref=n-qubit-biseparable-2]) holds for any biseparable n-qubit pure state ρ.

Now we suppose that [formula] is a biseparable mixed state, and ρ(m) = |ψm〉〈ψm| is biseparable. Then, simple algebra and the Cauchy inequality show that

[formula]

which is the desired result.

Observation 3 and Observation 4 (ii) in [\cite=GuhneNJP2010] are the special cases n = 3 and n = 4 of Theorem 3, respectively.

The separability criteria of fully separable n-partite states

In this section, we consider fully separable n-partite states.

For fully separable n-qubit states, by utilizing the Cauchy inequality and Hölder inequality, we derive:

Theorem 4   If an n-qubit density matrix ρ is fully separable, then the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

[formula]

These two inequalities are equalities for fully separable n-partite pure states.

Proof. First, let us start with pure states.

Suppose that ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ| is a fully sepaprable n-qubit pure state, where

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

that is, the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable]) is an equality for fully separable n-qubit pure states.

Note that

[formula]

for any [formula]. It also implies that the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable]) is an equality for fully separable n-qubit pure states.

([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable-1]) follows immediately from

[formula]

Next we show that the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable]) is also right for fully separable mixed states.

Suppose that [formula], where ρ(i) is fully separable n-qubit pure state. Then

[formula]

Continuously using the Hölder inequality

[formula]

we get

[formula]

as claimed.

Simple algebra and the Cauchy inequality show that ([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable-1]) holds for fully separable n-partite mixed states.

Observation 4 (i) and (iii) in [\cite=GuhneNJP2010] are the case n = 3 of this theorem.

For the well-studied n-qubit GHZ states mixed with white noise, Theorem 4 constitutes a necessary and sufficient criterion for fully separable.

Theorem 5   For [formula], ρ(p) is fully separable iff the entries of ρ(p) satisfy the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable]).

Proof. Necessity is immediate from Theorem 4. Conversely if the inequality ([\ref=n-qubit-fully-separable]) holds for ρ(p), i.e. [formula], then there is [formula], which implies that [formula]. Therefore, ρ(p) is fully separable [\cite=DurCiracPRA99].

Observation 4 (iv) in [\cite=GuhneNJP2010] is the case n = 3 of this theorem.

Furthermore, for high dimension and n-partite, using the Hölder inequality, we can infer:

Theorem 6   For any n-particle density matrix ρ (particle k is dk level, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n), if ρ is fully separable, then

[formula]

where A is the set of 2n - 2 numbers [formula] such that ik∈{0,dk - 1}, and [formula], i.e., [formula].

If ρ is a fully separable n-particle pure state, then the inequality ([\ref=n-partite-fully-separable]) is an equality.

Proof.   Suppose that ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ| is fully separable pure state, where

[formula]

Then the elements of ρ

[formula]

where [formula], [formula].

Since

[formula]

for any [formula] and dn + 1 = 1, this gives

[formula]

It implies that

[formula]

thus ([\ref=n-partite-fully-separable]) holds for fully separable pure states. Here [formula].

One can also derive ([\ref=n-partite-fully-separable-pure]) by direct calculation.

Next we suppose that [formula] is an n-partite mixed state, where ρ(i) = |ψi〉〈ψi| is fully separable. Using ([\ref=n-partite-fully-separable-pure]) for each ρ(i), we see

[formula]

Let [formula] be the elements in the set A. By the Hölder inequality, we obtain

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=n-partite-full-separable-1]) and ([\ref=n-partite-full-separable-2]) gives the inequality ([\ref=n-partite-fully-separable]), as required.

conclusion

We derive separability criteria for n-qubit and n-qudit quantum states directly in terms of matrix elements. Some of them are also sufficient conditions for genuine entanglement of n-partite quantum states. One of the resulting criteria is also necessary and sufficient condition for a class of n-partite states. We give clear and complete proof of each criterion from general partition by using the Cauchy inequality and Hölder inequality.
