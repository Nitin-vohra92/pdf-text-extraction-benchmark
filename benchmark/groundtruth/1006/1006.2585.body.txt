On a species survival model

Introduction and statement of results

Recently, Guiol, Marchado, and Schinazi [\cite=GMS] proposed a new mathematical framework for modeling species survival which is closely related to the discrete Bak-Sneppen evolution model. In the original Bak-Sneppen model [\cite=BSM] a finite number of species are arranged in a circle, each species being characterized by its location and a parameter representing the fitness of the species and taking values between zero and one. The number of species and their location on the circle are fixed and remain unchanged throughout the evolution of the system. At discrete times [formula] the species with the lowest fitness and its two immediate neighbors update simultaneously their fitness values at random. The Bak-Sneppen evolution model is often referred to as an "ecosystem" because of the local interaction between different species. The distinguishing feature of the model is the emergence of self-organized criticality [\cite=BAKB] [\cite=evolution] [\cite=GMW] [\cite=jensen] regardless the simplicity and robustness of the underlying evolution mechanism. The Bak-Sneppen model has attracted significant attention over the past few decades, but it has also been proven to be difficult for analytical study. See for instance [\cite=GMW] for a relatively recent survey of the model.

The asymptotic behavior of the Bak-Sneppen model, as the number of species gets arbitrarily large, was conjectured on the basis of computer simulations in [\cite=BSM]. It appears that the distribution of the fitness is asymptotically uniform on an interval [formula] for some critical parameter [formula], the value of which is close to 2 / 3 [\cite=BAKB] [\cite=jensen].

Guiol, Marchado, and Schinazi [\cite=GMS] were able to prove a similar result for a related model with a stochastically growing number of species. Their analysis is based on a reduction to the study of a certain random walk, which allows them to build a proof using well-known results from the theory of random walks. The main result of [\cite=GMS] is thus based on general properties of Markov chains, and suitable variations of the result can in principle be carried out to other similar models.

In this paper we focus on the model introduced in [\cite=GMS] as is. Our aim is to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for the phenomenon described in [\cite=GMS] by sharpening the estimates that lead to the major qualitative statement therein. We proceed with a description of the Guiol, Marchado, and Schinazi (GMS) model.

In contrast to the Bak-Sneppen model, the number of species in the GMS model is random and changes in time, and only the species with the lowest fitness is randomly replaced. The local interaction between species is not considered in the GMS model, and therefore the spatial structure of the population is of no importance. Let [formula] be given and denote q = 1 - p. Let [formula] denote the set of non-negative integers and let [formula] be a discrete-time birth and death process with the following transition probabilities: from each site, Xn increases by 1 with probability p; from each site different than 0, Xn decreases by 1 with probability q = (1 - p); finally, at 0, Xn stays put with probability q. Thus X is a nearest-neighbor transient random walk on the integer lattice [formula] with holding times and reflection barrier at zero. Throughout the paper we assume that X0 = 0 with probability one.

The model describes the evolution of a population of species: newborn species are given "equal opportunity" by assigning them a random fitness, and the least fit species are the first to die. A jump to the right represents birth of a new species, whereas a jump to the left represents death of an existing species. Thus Xn represents the number of species alive at time n. When a new species is born, it is assigned a fitness. The fitness is a uniform

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:limit]

There is no loss of generality assuming that X is obtained recursively from an i.i.d. sequence of Bernoulli random variables [formula] with P(Jn = 1) = q, P(Jn = 0) = p, as follows: X0 = 0 and for [formula] we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be a Markov chain formed by the pairs Gn  =  (Ln,Jn). Figure [\ref=fig:Gprob] illustrates the transition mechanism of G.

Reduction from Bn - Rn to an occupation time of G

Let [formula] be the process defined through Δn  =  Bn - Rn. Notice that Δn increases by 1 if and only if Rn decreases by 1, and otherwise stays put. That is

[formula]

Thus by [\eqref=eq:Xdefn], Δn + 1  -  Δn  =  (1 - sn)Jn{Ln = 0}, and we have

[formula]

Observe that ηn is the occupation time (number of visits) of G at (0,1) up to time n - 1 and that [formula] is bounded above by [formula] Since X is transient and X0 = 0, the latter series can be represented in the form [formula] where g is the total number of visits to zero (distributed geometrically, according to P(g = k) = fk - 1c(1 - fc), [formula] see for instance [\cite=durrett]) and hi are successive holding times of X at zero (i.i.d. sequence of geometric random variables, independent of g, with P(hi = k) = qk - 1p, [formula]). In particular,

[formula]

Since L and consequently G are recurrent (and thus Δn is a non-decreasing sequence converging to +    ∞   with probability one), it therefore suffices to show that Theorem [\ref=th:limit] holds with Δn = Bn - Rn replaced by ηn in its statement.

Excursion decomposition for the path of L.

We decompose the path of L into a sequence of successive excursions from 0, each one lasting until (but not including) the first time L returns to 0 from 1. Observe that once the Markov chain L is at zero, it will stay put until Jk = 0 and the fitness of the newborn particle is less than fc. Therefore, the holding time of L at zero during one excursion is a geometric random variable with parameter pfc = q. Let h̃k be the i.i.d. sequence of holding times at zero during successive excursions of L from zero. That is, P(h̃k = n) = pn - 1q, [formula] In what follows we will use the notation (a) for the geometric distribution with parameter a (for instance, we could write h̃k  ~  (q)). Let σk be the k-th excursion starting time, that is σ1 = 0 and

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is an i.i.d. sequence and

[formula]

We now compute μ: = E(μk) using the fact that the sequence of pairs Gn = (Jn,Ln) forms a Markov chain, the transition mechanism of which is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:Gprob]. The value of μ is equal to the expected number of visits by this Markov chain to the state (0,1) during the period of time starting at the state (0,1) with probability q and at (0,0) with probability p, and lasting until G leaves the set {(0,0),(0,1)}. We thus have, using first step analysis,

[formula]

Hence μ = 1. Consequently, using [\eqref=law-ln] and the law of large numbers, we obtain

[formula]

Reduction to a simple random walk

The duration of the k-th excursion of L from zero is equal to the sum h̃k  +  αk of the holding time at zero h̃k distributed as (q), and the time αk that it takes for L to return from 1 to zero. Notice that

[formula]

For [formula] let [formula] be the total duration of the first m excursions of L from 0. Then Nk  =   max {m:Vm  ≤  k}. With each excursion we can associate a skeleton, which is the path obtained from the excursion by omitting all transitions from a state to itself, for all states. If we let τk denote the length of the skeleton, then due to the choice of fc it follows that τk has the same distribution as the time required for the simple symmetric random walk on [formula] to get back to 0 starting from 0. Furthermore, the time spent by L at each visit to a site is a geometric random variable, (2q) for sites different than 0 and (q) for 0. Therefore, the length of a single excursion itself is a sum of one (q) random variable plus a sum of τk - 1 independent (2q) random variables. If we replace h̃k with a (2q), then the resulting modified "excursion time" becomes a sum of τk copies of a (2q) random variable. Let Vm' denote the total length of the first m excursions modified in this way. Let Nk' denote the number of such excursions occurred by time k, that is Nk' =  max {m:Vm'  ≤  k}. Then Vm stochastically dominates Vm'. By the law of large numbers,

[formula]

where h1' is a geometric random variable with parameter 2q. Letting [formula] we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables, each one distributed as (2q). Thus, by the law of large numbers,

[formula]

Notice that Tm is distributed the same as the total length of the first m excursions from zero of a simple symmetric random walk.

Completion of the proof: CLT and LIL for ηn

LIL for ηn

We need the following result. Although the claim is a "folk fact", we give a short proof for the sake of completeness.

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the simple symmetric random walk on [formula]. Let γ0 = 0 and define inductively γm + 1  =   inf {k > γm:Sk = m + 1}. Let Ym  =  γm + 1  -  γm with the usual convention that the infimum over an empty set is +    ∞  . Let [formula] for x > 0. By the law of iterated logarithm for S,

[formula]

Since φ- 1(x)  ~  x2 / (2 ln  ln x) as x  →    ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

Observe that [formula]. The distribution of t1, the time to return to 0 starting from 0 for S, is equal to the distribution of t1', the time to return to 0 starting from 0 for the reflected random walk |S|. Since t1' is equal in distribution to 1 + Y1,

[formula]

completing the proof of the lemma.

Using the lemma along with [\eqref=eq:lln] and [\eqref=eq:Vl'], we obtain

[formula]

Consequently, since N is the inverse of sequence of V, we obtain

[formula]

Combining this with [\eqref=eq:etan] completes the proof of the law of iterated logarithm for ηn.

CLT for ηn

We now turn to the proof of the central limit theorem. It is well known (see for instance [\cite=durrett]) that

[formula]

Therefore, it follows from [\eqref=eq:lln] and [\eqref=eq:Vl'] that

[formula]

The function [formula] θ  ≥  0, is the Laplace transform of a positive stable law with index 1 / 2 whose density function is given by (see for instance [\cite=durrett])

[formula]

We intend to use this formula with [formula] Set V0 = 0 and observe that for all [formula]

[formula]

Fix s > 0 and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Differentiating the right-hand side we obtain

[formula]

Therefore [formula] converges weakly to the absolute value of a centered normal random variable with variance equal to c- 2  =  2q. Combining this with [\eqref=eq:etan] completes the proof of the central limit theorem for ηn.
