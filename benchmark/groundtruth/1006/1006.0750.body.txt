Distribution and dynamics of entanglement in high-dimensional quantum systems using convex-roof extended negativity

Whereas shared entanglement between parties can serve as a non-local resource with no classical counterpart, there are several practical matters we need to consider to optimize the efficiency of entanglement usage. One of them is the creation or distribution of entanglement. Even though the particles share an entangled state, the state may be useless as a non-local resource in quantum information tasks unless sufficient entanglement for the task is shared between desired parties to meet requirement for the task. It is thus important to distribute entanglement between specified parties and to have a proper way of quantifying how much entanglement can be distributed.

Another practical matter we have to consider is the fragile nature of entanglement: although sufficient entanglement is shared between desired parties, this entanglement may be destroyed gradually due to interaction with the environment, which is known as decoherence. Thus, it is also an important task to quantify or to bound the amount of entanglement under dynamics.

For distribution of entanglement, an analytical upper bound for the amount of remote entanglement distribution (RED) was shown for qubit systems [\cite=GS] using concurrence [\cite=Wootters] as a bipartite entanglement quantification. Using concurrence, entanglement evolution including decoherence-induced non-unitary evolution of a two-qubit state under a local channel was shown to be bounded by the amounts of entanglement for the initial state and the entanglement evolution of a maximally entangled state through the channel [\cite=KDTKAB]. Later, each of these results has been generalized independently for higher-dimensional quantum systems in terms of G-concurrence [\cite=Gour] [\cite=TDB].

The study of quantum entanglement in higher-dimensional quantum systems is important and necessary for both theoretical and practical reasons to optimize the efficiency of entanglement usage. For example, in the applications of quantum information theory such as quantum cryptography and quantum error correcting code (QECC), higher-dimensional quantum systems are sometimes preferred because of their coding efficiency and security [\cite=gjvw].

However, generalizations of such security or efficiency proofs from the case of qubits to the case of qudits are usually non-trivial, for instance, the proof of a no-go theorem for the universal set of transversal gates in QECC [\cite=cccz]. Thus, the extension of entanglement analysis, especially the quantitative relations of entanglement from qubit to qudit systems is a fundamental step that is necessary to understand the whole concept of quantum entanglement.

Here we provide an explicit relation between two different theories, entanglement distribution and entanglement dynamics in arbitrary dimensional quantum systems for the isotropic states and the generalized depolarizing channel. Based on the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism between states and a quantum channel [\cite=CJiso], we note that the evolution of a two-qudit state through two one-sided channels corresponds to RED by means of a joint measurement on the two qudits consisting of each one particle of a pair of two-qudit states. Furthermore, by using convex-roof extended negativity (CREN) [\cite=LCOK] as a bipartite entanglement quantification, we also overcome the lack of separability criterion of G-concurrence in the previous results [\cite=Gour] [\cite=TDB], whereas G-concurrence only detects genuine d-dimensional entanglement whose reduced density matrix has full rank.

For a pure state [formula] in [formula] quantum systems (d'  ≥  d), its CREN is

[formula]

with [formula]. For a mixed state ρ12, its CREN is

[formula]

where the minimum is taken over all possible pure-state decompositions of ρ12 such that [formula].

CREN satisfies the separability criterion for any bipartite mixed state of arbitrary dimension, and it does not increase under local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC) [\cite=LCOK]. Furthermore, CREN is relevant to the study of multipartite entanglement, especially in characterizing the monogamy of entanglement in multi-party systems [\cite=kds].

CREN reduces to concurrence for two-qubit systems. In other words, CREN can be considered as a generalization of the two-qubit concurrence, and thus the results of entanglement distribution and entanglement dynamics for qubits systems [\cite=GS] [\cite=KDTKAB] can be rephrased as the following two propositions, respectively.

Now we show a relation between these two results for the isotropic states and the generalized depolarizing channel in arbitrary qudit systems. Before this, we begin with some useful terminology and notation.

Let

[formula]

be unitary operators on qudit systems where ω = e2πi / d. Any operator spanned by X and Z is referred to as a generalized Pauli operator [\cite=pz] [\cite=gkp] [\cite=bgs]. Moreover, due to the commuting relation

[formula]

each generalized Pauli operator can be expressed as XkZl for some integers k and l, up to constant factors.

For 0  ≤  k,l  ≤  d - 1, let

[formula]

be the two-qudit generalized Bell states [\cite=bbcjw], where [formula] is the d-dimensional maximally entangled state. The set of all generalized Bell states forms an orthonormal basis for two-qudit systems, which is called the generalized Bell basis.

For 0  ≤  F  ≤  1, let

[formula]

be the generalized depolarizing channel in qudit systems with fidelity F, and let

[formula]

be a two-qudit isotropic state, then we readily have the following propositions.

Now, let us consider an initial four-qudit state [formula], which is a product of two isotropic states ρ12F0 and ρ34F1 in the subsystems 12 and 34 respectively with 0  ≤  F0,F1  ≤  1. If the subsystem 23 is measured in the generalized Bell basis with the measurement outcome |Ψ23k,l〉 for some k and l, the resultant state in subsystem 14 becomes

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the probability of outcome |Ψ23k,l〉. From Propositions [\ref=Prop:depolar_prop] and [\ref=rho_F_iso] together with Eq. ([\ref=eq:dBell_prop]), we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and hence σ14k,l is equivalent to the state [formula] up to local unitary operations. Furthermore, Propositions [\ref=Prop:depolar_prop] and [\ref=rho_F_iso] readily yield

[formula]

where F' = (d2F0F1  -  F0  -  F1 + 1) / (d2 - 1). Thus, we obtain the following lemma.

Here, we note that CREN can be analytically evaluated for the class of isotropic states in [formula] quantum systems [\cite=LCOK]; that is,

[formula]

Thus, from Lemma [\ref=Lem:resulting_state], we can obtain the following bound on RED by the generalized Bell measurement onto the two-qudit subsystem 23 over the two isotropic states [formula]. For the case when F'  >  1 / d, it is straightforward to check that F0  >  1 / d and F1  >  1 / d, and thus

[formula]

If F'  ≤  1 / d, then by Eq. ([\ref=eq:N_isotropic]), we have Nc(ρF') = 0; hence

[formula]

We are therefore ready for the following theorem about the bound on RED for qudits systems, which is a generalization of the qubit case in Eq. ([\ref=eq:REDineq2]) for the isotropic states.

Now, let us consider the relation between the bound on RED in Theorem [\ref=Thm:main] and entanglement dynamics in qudit systems  [\cite=TDB]. First, we note that, due to the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism and Eq. ([\ref=eq:resulting]), the left-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=eq:constraint10]) becomes

[formula]

where $F1 is the generalized depolarizing channel and ρF0 is the isotropic state with fidelities F1 and F0 respectively. Furthermore, the right-hand side Nc(ρF0)Nc(ρF1) of Eq. ([\ref=eq:constraint10]) can also be represented as

[formula]

due to Eq. ([\ref=eq:rho_F]) in Proposition [\ref=Prop:depolar_prop]. Therefore, Theorem [\ref=Thm:main] can clearly be rewritten as the following corollary, which is about the bound on the entanglement evolution of a two-qudit isotropic state under the action of a one-sided generalized depolarizing channel.

To summarize, we have generalized entanglement distribution and dynamics of entanglement into arbitrary qudit systems for isotropic states and generalized depolarizing channels in terms of the CREN, and established a relation between them. Here, we note that isotropic states form a generic class of quantum states, to which any arbitrary quantum state can be transformed via LOCC. Furthermore, the generalized depolarizing channel is the most typical case of quantum decoherence in the sense that any quantum channel (and thus any quantum decoherence) together with certain LOCC is equivalent to the generalized depolarizing channel. Therefore, our result deals with generalizations of two different theories and their explicit relation for a generic class of quantum states and typical quantum channels in arbitrary dimensional quantum systems.

The study of quantum entanglement, especially for higher-dimensional quantum systems, is important and even necessary for various applications. However, the generalization of entanglement properties from qubits to qudits is usually nontrivial even for the case of quantifying entanglement: still there is no universal entanglement measure that has analytic way of evaluation, besides qubit systems. Due to this lack of analytical evaluation, the properties of quantum entanglement in higher-dimensional systems are barely understood so far.

Here we have shown that CREN is a powerful entanglement measure generalizing the quantitative bounds for both entanglement distribution and entanglement dynamics into higher-dimensional quantum systems. Furthermore, we have also proposed a clue to possible unification of these different theories for arbitrary Hilbert-space dimensional quantum systems by showing their explicit relation for a generic class quantum states and quantum channels.
