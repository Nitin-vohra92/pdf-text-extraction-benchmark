Introduction

A fundamental result of E. Viehweg [\cite=V] states that for any polarized algebraic variety the coarse moduli space [formula] exists as a quasi-projective variety. It is of great interest to characterize those cases in which [formula] is a locally Hermitian symmetric variety. It has been shown in [\cite=VZ1], [\cite=VZ2], [\cite=MVZ] that Arakelov-type equalities lead to sufficient conditions for this to happen. In this paper we describe the techniques of characteristic varieties that leads to necessary conditions that can be checked by a straightforward calculation in concrete examples. This leads to a computational tool that we apply to the moduli space of double octics ramified over an arrangement of eight planes in [formula].

As over a coarse moduli space [formula] there usually does not exist a family, we use the following weaker notion. We say that a proper smooth map f:X  →  S over a smooth connected base S is a good family for [formula], if the moduli map [formula] of f is dominant and generically finite. The local system [formula] of primitive cohomomogies has the structure of a weight n polarized variation of [formula]-Hodge structures, in short [formula]-PVHS, over S. Recall that this means, among other things, that there is an Hodge filtration [formula] on the vector bundle [formula] with flat connection [formula] for which Griffiths transversality [formula] holds. The associated graded object [formula] where Ep,q: = Fp  /  Fp - 1 are the Hodge-bundles and θ is induced by [formula] is called the associated Higgs-bundle. In general, we call a PVHS [formula] over S of Calabi-Yau type (CY-type) if rank ~ En,0  =  1 and the morphism of vector bundles

[formula]

induced by [formula] is an isomorphism at the generic point. It follows from the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem on the unobstructedness of the infinitesimal deformations of a Calabi-Yau manifold X, that for a good family the map θn,0 is naturally identified with the Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism, so in such a situation we obtain a PVHS of CY-type.

In this paper we study a particular example of an interesting family of Calabi-Yau threefolds. An arrangement [formula] of eight planes in general position in [formula] determines a double cover X, which is a Calabi-Yau variety with singularities along 28 lines. A resolution [formula] of such a double octic has [formula] and carries a weight 3 polarized Hodge structure with Hodge numbers (1,9,9,1). If we vary the arrangement [formula] in a good family, we obtain an irreducible weight three [formula]-PVHS [formula] of CY-type over a smooth 9 dimensional base S. We will show several theorems about [formula].

[formula] does not factor canonically.

By this we mean the following. Associated to a Hermitian symmetric domain D0 = G0 / K0 there is a special PVHS [formula] on D0 coming from the representation ρcan:G0  →  GL(W), which is called the canonical PVHS by B. Gross. We say that [formula] factors canonically if the period map of [formula] factors through the one determined by certain canonical PVHS (D0,ρcan). For a precise definition see .

A way to exclude this happening consists of picking an appropriate point s∈S, compute an appropriate characteristic subvariety of [formula] in [formula] and compare it with the corresponding object for [formula]. If these varieties are not isomorphic we are done.

Our example is a member of a well-known infinite series of Calabi-Yau n-folds coming from double covers of generic arrangements of 2n + 2 hyperplanes in [formula]. For n = 1 one has the classical theory of four points in [formula] and the associated elliptic curves and their modulus. The paper [\cite=MSY] was devoted to n = 2 case. Here we have K3-surfaces that are double covers of six lines in the plane. In [\cite=MSY] it was shown among other things that in this case there is a natural good family whose associated weight 2 PVHS factors canonically. It was asked by I. Dolgachev (see [\cite=Bo]) if the n  ≥  3 cases are canonical with respect to (DIn,n,ρcan), where [formula] is the indicated representation of real Lie groups. Motivated by this question, it has been checked in [\cite=S] that the primitive Hodge numbers of CY n-folds are exactly the same as predicted by Dolgachev for all [formula].

In the pioneering work [\cite=SYY] a result similar to Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem1_introduction] for more general moduli spaces of configurations was given, but the methods used there are completely different from ours. Our method is based on classical Hodge theory (see for example [\cite=Griffiths]) and can be applied to many other concrete moduli spaces, for example the moduli spaces of the Calabi-Yau varieties in toric varieties. Moreover, we hope to extend the present work to the n  ≥  4 cases.

Using Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem1_introduction] we will prove the

Let s∈S be a base point and let

[formula]

be the monodromy representation associated to [formula]. Then the image of τ is Zariski dense in [formula].

Using results of C. Schoen and P. Deligne the above theorem implies:

The special Mumford-Tate group of a general member in [formula] is [formula].

However, there exists an interesting subvariety of [formula] where the special Mumford-Tate groups are proper subgroups of [formula]. Generalizing a construction from [\cite=MSY], we define a five-dimensional subvariety [formula] that we call the hyperelliptic locus. Over it, the Hodge structure is isomorphic to [formula] of a H1(C), where C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus three. It is natural to ask if this decomposition can be extended to a larger variety [formula] that contains [formula]. Using a calculation of characteristic subvarieties we arrive at a negative answer.

Let [formula] be the hyperelliptic locus of [formula] and [formula] be any subvariety of [formula] which strictly contains [formula]. Let f:X  →  S be a good family for [formula] whose moduli map [formula] is dominant over [formula]. Then the restriction of [formula] to the inverse image of [formula] does not factor through [formula].

As a corollary we have the following

The special Mumford-Tate group of the Calabi-Yau threefolds in [formula] is a subgroup of [formula]. Furthermore [formula] is maximal with this property. That is, for any irreducible subvariety [formula] of [formula] which strictly contains [formula], the special Mumford-Tate group of a general closed point in [formula] is not contained in [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem3_introduction] relies on new results of Hodge-theoretical nature. There is Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem2_introduction] on the tensor product decomposition of [formula]-PVHS, parallel to the direct sum decomposition of [formula]-PVHS due to P. Deligne (cf. [\cite=D1]). Let S̄ denote a projective manifold, Z a simple divisor with normal crossing and [formula]. Let [formula] denote an irreducible [formula]-PVHS over S with quasi-unipotent local monodromy around each component of Z. Fix a base point s∈S let

[formula]

denote the representation of the fundamental group associated to the underlying local system of [formula]-vector spaces, where [formula] denotes the fibre of [formula] over s. Let G be the Zariski closure of the image of ρ inside [formula]. Assume that G decomposes into a direct product [formula] of simple Lie groups. Then according to Schur's lemma, we obtain a decomposition of local systems [formula].

Each local system [formula] admits the structure of a [formula]-PVHS such that the induced [formula]-PVHS on the tensor product [formula] coincides with the given [formula]-PVHS on [formula].

The proof of the theorem is independent of the other results in this paper. We expect the result to be useful in other situations. In this article it helps to prove the following classification result.

Let S be a smooth quasi-projective algebraic variety and [formula] be an weight 3 [formula]-PVHS over S which is irreducible over [formula] and of quasi-unipotent local monodromies. If the Hodge numbers of [formula] are (1,9,9,1), then after a possible finite étale base change the connected component of the real Zariski closure of the monodromy group of [formula] is one of the following:

SU(1,1)  ×  SO0(2,8),

SU(3,3),

[formula],

[formula].

Using this theorem and Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem1_introduction], [\ref=MainTheorem4_introduction] to exclude cases (A), (B) and (C) one easily obtains Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem3_introduction].

Two Calabi-Yau Threefolds

Consider an arrangement [formula] of eight planes in [formula]. Such an arrangement can be given by a matrix [formula], the i-th row corresponding to the defining equation

[formula]

of the hyperplane Hi. We say that [formula] is in general position if no four of the planes intersect in a point. In terms of the matrix A this means that each (4  ×  4)-minor is non-zero. We now describe two closely related Calabi-Yau threefolds associated to such an arrangement [formula] in general position.

The double octic

The planes of the arrangement [formula] determine a divisor [formula] on [formula]. As the degree of R is even and the Picard group of [formula] has no torsion, there exists a unique double cover [formula] that ramifies over R. The singular locus of such a double octic X is precisely the preimage of the singular locus of R. Its irreducible components are given by the lines [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  8. We fix an ordering of the index set [formula] and let [formula] denote the composition of blow-ups whose centers are the strict transforms of Hij, taken in the chosen order. The fibre product [formula] sits in a commutative diagram

[formula]

In case we start with an arrangement in general position, the variety [formula] thus obtained is a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold. Note however that a different ordering of I yields a different birational minimal model of the singular variety X.

The space of infinitesimal deformations of [formula] is naturally isomorphic to the space of infinitesimal deformations of [formula].

This follows from the description of infinitesimal deformation space of a double covers obtained in [\cite=CVanS]. We let L (resp. [formula]) be the line bundles on [formula] (resp. [formula]) in the decomposition

[formula]

It satisfies [formula] (resp. [formula] for [formula] the strict transform of R under φ). One has the decomposition of tangent sheaf

[formula]

It follows that one has natural isomorphism (see also Prop. 2.1 [\cite=CVanS])

[formula]

By Corollary 4.3 in [\cite=CVanS], the space [formula] is naturally isomorphic to the space of equisingular deformations of R in [formula]. Since R is a divisor with normal crossings, this space is isomorphic to the space of infinitesimal deformations of the arrangement [formula] in [formula]. Furthermore, the space of transverse deformation [formula] has dimension (after Prop. 5.1 [\cite=CVanS])

[formula]

where the vanishing of the first summand follows from Bott's vanishing theorem on homogenous vector bundles over the projective spaces. The lemma thus follows.

From now on we let [formula] denote the moduli space of arrangements [formula] of eight planes in [formula] in general position, and let [formula] denote the moduli space of [formula].

The moduli map [formula] is étale.

There are many ways to construct a good family for [formula]. Here is one. Let [formula] be an arrangement in general position. The moduli point of [formula] in [formula] can be uniquely represented by the matrix A of the form:

[formula]

Conversely a matrix A in the above form whose all 4  ×  4 minors are nonzero represents an arrangement [formula] in general position. Thus [formula] can be realized as an open subvariety of the affine space [formula] and it admits a natural good family [formula], where X is obtained by simultaneous resolution of the singular double octic over [formula]. Note also that a good family for [formula] gives rise to a good family for [formula].

This construction and the above lemma can actually be generalized to arrangements of 2n + 2 hyperplanes in [formula]. It yields a moduli space of smooth CY n-folds whose primitive Hodge numbers are given by [formula]. For details, we refer to [\cite=S].

Now we proceed with the construction of another Calabi-Yau threefold Y for a given arrangement [formula].

The Kummer cover

Let A  =  (aij) denote a (8  ×  4)-matrix associated to [formula] as described above. Furthermore let B  =  (bij) denote a matrix in [formula] such that the sequence

[formula]

is exact. We let Y denote the complete intersection of the four quadrics in [formula] defined by the four equations

[formula]

In case [formula] is in general position, the space Y is smooth (see Proposition 3.1.2 in [\cite=Te0]). There is a simple relation between the singular double octic X and Y. To describe it, let [formula] denote the elementary abelian 2-group of order 256. For a  =  (a1,...,a8)∈G1 we define an automorphism [formula] by

[formula]

The group G1 contains a distinguished normal subgroup [formula] of index two, the kernel of the map [formula].

[formula]

First remark that the matrix A defines a linear embedding [formula] of projective spaces. As Ker(B) = Im(A), the map [formula], (y1:...:y8)  ↦  (y21:...:y28) maps Y onto the image of j and realizes [formula] as the quotient of Y by G1. The quotient map π1 factors over Y / N1, and the degree of Y / N1 over [formula] is two. The ramification locus of the resulting map [formula] is precisely R. Indeed, the nontrivial element in G1 / N1 is represented by any vector ei  =  (0,...,1,...,0) in the standard bases of [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  8. Consequently, the ramification locus consists of all points in [formula] with one coordinate zero. The embedding [formula] maps the planes H1,...,H8 onto the intersection of [formula] with the coordinate hyperplanes in [formula]. As the double octic X is uniquely determined by R, it follows X = Y / N1.

This geometric relation between Y, X and [formula] immediately leads to the following isomorphism of Hodge-structures.

For a given arrangement [formula] in general position there exists a natural isomorphism

[formula]

of rational polarized Hodge structures. (Here [formula] denotes the subspace of invariants under N1.)

As X = Y / N1, one has immediately has [formula], showing that [formula] carries a pure Hodge structure. Let [formula] be the resolution map described above. As in general the kernel of the map [formula] is the part of smaller Hodge-weight (see Corollary 5.42 of [\cite=ps]), we conclude that ψ* is injective. As the dimensions agree, φ* is an isomorphism. (This, of course, can also directly be seen from the Leray spectral sequence for ψ.)

The hyperelliptic locus

There exist an interesting locus in [formula] where the Hodge-structure is a third exterior power:

[formula]

where C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. Such a C is obtained by a two-fold cover of [formula] ramified over eight points. There exists a natural morphism

[formula]

which sends the point s  =  ((x1:y1),(x2:y2),(x3:y3)) to (c0(x,y):c1(x,y):c2(x,y):c3(x,y)), where x = (x1,x2,x3), y = (y1,y2,y3) and ci(x,y) is the i-th coefficient of the polynomial of the variables t, s

[formula]

This morphism γ is Galois covering with Galois group S3, the symmetric group acting on three letters.

One readily checks that for any [formula] the set [formula] is the hyperplane with equation

[formula]

We say that H is the plane associated to the point p.

Let (p1,...,p8) denote a collection of eight distinct points in [formula], and let [formula] the associated planes. Then [formula] is an arrangement of planes in general position.

In appropriate coordinates on [formula], we may assume that pi = ( - 1:ai) with [formula] pairwise distinct (1  ≤  i  ≤  8). The matrix [formula] corresponding to the arrangement [formula] then has the form

[formula]

Every (4  ×  4)-submatrix of A is a Vandermonde matrix, hence its determinant is non-zero. This proves that [formula] is in general position.

Let C be the hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 branched at [formula], and let [formula] denote the corresponding covering map. The threefold product

[formula]

is a Galois covering of degree 23  ·  6  =  48. Its Galois group G2 is isomorphic to a semi-direct product [formula], where N  =  〈ι1,ι2,ι3〉 is the group generated by the hyperelliptic involution. We let N2 denote the index two subgroup [formula] of G2, where N' is the kernel of [formula], where the isomorphism sends ι1 to (1,0,0) etc. We factor h over the set of N2-orbits and obtain a commutative diagram

[formula]

The double cover [formula] branches along the union of the hyperplanes H1,...,H8 associated to the points p1,...,p8. So [formula], where X is the double octic determined by H1,...,H8.

The Galois group of π is isomorphic to G2 / N2, and it is generated by the image of ι1. Hence the ramification locus of π is the image of the fixed locus L1  ⊆  C3 of ι1 under [formula]. By the commutativity of the above diagram, it coincides with the image of L1 under [formula]. Obviously we have

[formula]

so that our claim follows from Lemma [\ref=HyperLem1]. As C3 / N2 and X are both double covers of [formula] with the same ramification divisor, they are isomorphic.

Let p1,...,p8 be eight distinct points in [formula], [formula] the associated arrangement of hyperplanes and [formula] the CY manifold which corresponds to this arrangement. Furthermore, let [formula] denote the hyperelliptic curve which ramifies at p1,...,p8. Then we have an isomorphism of rational polarized Hodge structures

[formula]

As [formula], we have

[formula]

Since S3 is contained in N2, we have an inclusion

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the symmetric threefold product of C, i.e. the quotient space C3  /  S3 where S3 acts on C3 by permutation of the factors. Let J denote the three dimensional Jacobian of C. By the Abel-Jacobi theorem, the natural map [formula] is birational, and it induces an isomorphism between the middle cohomology spaces. Thus

[formula]

Now the latter space is 20 dimensional, which is also the dimension of [formula]. This shows that the inclusion [formula] we constructed is actually an isomorphism.

Let [formula] denote the moduli space of eight points in [formula], which is five dimensional. Lemma [\ref=HyperLem1] shows that there exist a natural embedding [formula]. We denote its image by [formula] and its image in [formula] under the map [formula] by [formula].

We call this the hyperelliptic sublocus.

It is worthwhile to remark that the construction generalizes to all n  ≥  2. It produces a 2n - 1 dimensional hyperelliptic locus in the n2 dimensional moduli of CY manifolds, over which the primitive middle dimensional rational Hodge structures are wedge products of weight one Hodge structures. For n  =  2 the space [formula] arises from the moduli space of six lines in [formula] in general position. In [\cite=MSY] the analogous sublocus [formula] was characterized as those six lines which are tangent to a smooth conic, and it was shown that it yields the family of Kummer surfaces.

Classifying spaces and Canonical Variations

We briefly recall some basic facts on Hodge structures and their classifying spaces. Let V denote a real vector space, [formula] and [formula] a non-degenerate bilinear form which is symmetric if n is even and skew-symmetric if n is odd. Furthermore, let {hp,q} denote a collection of non-negative integers parameterized by [formula] such that

[formula]

The set D of all real Hodge structures of type Φ  =  (V,{hp,q},b) is equipped with a natural structure of a complex manifold, called the classifying space of Hodge structures of type Φ. It is a homogeneous space of the form D = G / K, where G denotes the real Lie subgroup of GL(V) consisting of all [formula]-linear automorphisms fixing b and where K denotes a compact subgroup of G.

Now let S be a complex manifold and fix a base point s∈S. Every [formula]-PVHS [formula] of type Φ over S gives rise to a map

[formula]

called the period map associated to [formula]. Here Γ is the image of the monodromy representation

[formula]

defined by [formula] considered as a local system of real vector spaces. We refer to Chapter I in [\cite=Griffiths] for more details.

In practice one often encounters situations where the real structure is lost. A typical example arises from the eigenspace decomposition of the complexification of the real cohomology of a cyclic cover with respect to the cyclic group action (see for example [\cite=DM], [\cite=ACT]). Complex polarized variations of Hodge structures are also natural objects in Simpson's correspondence (see [\cite=Sim], ). We will use this slightly generalized notion of [formula]-PVHS in this paper and we refer to in [\cite=D1] for the notions of complex Hodge structure ([formula]-HS), complex polarized Hodge structure ([formula]-PHS) and complex polarized variations ([formula]-PVHS). In [\cite=D1], also classifying spaces of [formula]-PHS of with given Hodge numbers are defined. The corresponding classifying spaces of [formula]-PHS are also of form D = G / K where G is a real Lie group and K is a compact subgroup of G. The difference from that of [formula]-PHS is in that G is not necessarily [formula] or SO(r,s), but can also be a special unitary group SU(p,q).

Locally homogenous and Canonical variations

Let D0 = G0 / K0 be a Hermitian symmetric domain (HSD) with G0 the connected component of the automorphism group of D0 and K0 a maximal compact subgroup of G0. There are four infinite series of classical domains after E. Cartan:

[formula],

[formula],

[formula],

[formula].

Now let Γ0 be a torsion free discrete subgroup of G0. Let ρ0:G0  →  GL(F) be a finite dimensional complex representation of G0. S. Zucker has shown in of [\cite=Zuc], that the complex local system [formula] over the complex manifold [formula] admits naturally a structure of [formula]-PVHS, which we will call, following [\cite=Zuc], a locally homogenous PVHS. By construction, it is clear that only when ρ is defined over [formula], [formula] is a [formula]-PVHS.

The following example of locally homogenous PVHS was considered by B. Gross in [\cite=Gross] and also appeared in [\cite=SZ] in connection with moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau varieties. As explained in Proposition 1.2.6 in [\cite=D1], D0 determines a special node of the Dynkin diagram of the simple complex Lie algebra [formula]. By the standard theory on the finite dimensional representations of semi-simple complex Lie algebras, this node also determines a fundamental representation W of [formula], and W integrates to an irreducible complex representation ρcan of G0. When D0 is of tube type, the representation W is exactly the one considered by B. Gross in [\cite=Gross] and only in this case W does admit an G0-invariant real form. The locally homogenous PVHS by the above construction are of CY type (cf. in [\cite=SZ]). Following Gross in [\cite=Gross], we call them canonical PVHS over [formula]. An important property of it is that the weight of [formula] is equal to the rank of D0.

Let (D0,ρ0) be a pair consisting of a HSD D0 and a homomorphism ρ0:G0  →  G of real Lie groups and let ψ̃:D0  →  D the map induced from ρ0 and

[formula]

1) We say that a [formula]-PVHS [formula] over S factors with respect to (D0,ρ0), when the period map [formula] of [formula] factors over ψ. That is, we have a diagram

[formula]

commutes.

2) For a [formula]-PVHS [formula] of CY type we say that [formula] factors canonically if it factors with respect to certain (D0,ρcan)

If [formula] factors with respect to (D0,ρ0), then j induces an isomorphism of [formula]-PVHS [formula], where [formula] is the locally homogenous PVHS induced by ρ0. Moreover the monodromy representation τ:π1(S,s)  →  G of [formula] factorizes over ρ0, i.e. there exists a homomorphism τ0:π1(S,s)  →  G0 such that the diagram

[formula]

commutes.

Let [formula] be the [formula]-PVHS associated with a good family for the coarse moduli space [formula]. If [formula] factors canonically, then it must factor with respect to either [formula] or [formula].

Assume [formula] factors with respect to (D0,ρcan) for certain HSD D0. By the local Torelli theorem for Calabi-Yau manifolds we know that D0 is at least 9 dimensional. We write [formula] be the decomposition into product of irreducible HSD's. Then [formula] with ρcan,i canonical PVHS over Di. By Schur's lemma [formula] decomposes accordingly. Since the weight of [formula] is 3, then k  ≤  3. Case k = 1:. Then D0 must be of tube type and [formula] associated with ρcan,1 must be the canonical [formula]-PVHS. By the classification in [\cite=Gross], the pair in the statement is the only possibility with correct Hodge numbers. Case k = 2:. Since D0 has rank 3, we can assume D1 has rank 1 and hence D1 is the unit disk. It follows also the Hodge numbers of [formula] over D1 is 1,1. Since D2 supports canonical [formula]-PVHS, it must be a type IV domain. After checking the Hodge numbers, one sees immediately the pair [formula] is the unique possibility. Case k = 3:. It follows that each Di, i = 1,2,3 has rank 1 and so the dimension of D1  ×  D2  ×  D3 is less than 9.

Characteristic Subvariety

We refer the reader to in [\cite=Griffiths1] and references therein for an account of the theory of infinitesimal variations of Hodge structures, in short IVHS, initiated by P. Griffiths. There is an important series of invariants of IVHS of a [formula]-PVHS [formula] of CY type over S, namely the characteristic subvarieties which are contained in the projectivized tangent bundle [formula]. The basic theory of characteristic subvarieties is developed in [\cite=SZ]. We recall the definition.

Let [formula] a [formula]-PVHS of weight n over S of weight n and (E,θ) the associated Higgs-bundle. For every k with 1  ≤  k  ≤  n, the k-th iterated Higgs field defines a morphism

[formula]

with dual map [formula]. Let [formula] denote the ideal generated by the image of (θk)* in the symmetric algebra [formula]. Then for every k with 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, the projective variety

[formula]

over S is called the k-th characteristic subvariety of [formula].

For a proper smooth family f:X  →  S of CY n-folds the Yukawa coupling of f is the section of [formula] defined by the n-th iterated Kodaira-Spencer maps of f. It has significance in physics and is an important invariant in the study of geometry on moduli spaces of CY manifolds. Note that the (n - 1)th characteristic subvariety is just the vanishing locus of the Yukawa coupling.

Let s∈S and (Ck)s be the fiber of Ck over s, which is a subvariety of [formula]. following simple lemma characterizes the tangent vectors at s whose classes lie in the reduced subvariety (Ck)reds.

Let v∈TS,s be a non-zero tangent vector,

[formula]

Let [formula] be a coarse moduli space of polarized smooth CY n-folds and f:X  →  S be a good family for it. Let s∈S be a point in the ramification locus of the moduli map [formula] of f. Then there is a projective linear subspace in (Ck)reds for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

The question is analytically local. Let X be the fiber of f over s and

[formula]

ρ: T→ (X,T).

[formula]

θ(ω)=ρ(v) ω,

[formula]

The main result in [\cite=SZ] identifies the characteristic subvarieties of the canonical PVHS over an irreducible HSD with the characteristic bundles introduced by N. Mok in [\cite=Mok].

Let D0 = G0 / K0 be an irreducible HSD of rank n, Γ0 be a torsion free discrete subgroup of G0 and let (E,θ) be the system of Hodge bundles associated to the canonical PVHS over [formula]. Then for each k with 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1 the k-th characteristic subvariety Ck of (E,θ) over T coincides with the k-th characteristic bundle Sk over T.

The characteristic bundles are first defined over D0 and invariant under the G0-action. By taking the quotient under the group Γ one obtains the characteristic bundles on T. For each irreducible HSD the characteristic bundles are explicitly described in Appendix (III.3) in [\cite=M1]. For the purpose of this article we need only the information of the first characteristic bundle for the HSDs DI3,3, DIII3, DIV8. For the convenience of the reader, we state them explicitly here. The following proposition is direct consequence of Theorem [\ref=identification].

Notations as Theorem [\ref=identification] and t∈T arbitrary point. Then (C1)t as subvariety of [formula] is isomorphic to

[formula] with the Segre embedding, when D0 = DI3,3,

[formula] with the Veronese embedding, when D0 = DIII3,

[formula] with Q a smooth quadratic hypersurface, when D0 = DIV8.

For the application we also need to work out the first characteristic subvariety in the reducible case D0 = DI1,1  ×  DIV8.

Notations as last proposition. Let D0 be the HSD DI1,1  ×  DIV8. Then for each point of t∈T, (C1)t as subvariety of [formula] is isomorphic to a disjoint union of a point P with a smooth quadratic hypersurface Q in a hyperplane of [formula] away from P. In particular, it is not equidimensional.

We put D1 = DI1,1 and D2 = DIV8 and fix the base point 0∈D0. Then the canonical PVHS [formula] over D0 is given by tensor product [formula] of the canonical PVHS [formula] over Di,i = 1,2. Let (Ei,θi) be the corresponding Higgs-bundle to [formula]. Then the corresponding Higgs-bundle (E,θ) to [formula] is given by [formula]. Let pi:D0  →  Di, i = 1,2 be the natural projection. Then one has natural isomorphism [formula]. Under this isomorphism, we represent a tangent vector v∈TD0,0 by a pair (v1,v2) with vi∈TDi,0. Take a nonzero vector [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=key_lemma], the fiber over 0 of the first characteristic subvariety of D0 is determined by

[formula]

A simple calculation shows that

[formula]

Hence v is a characteristic vector if and only if v2 = 0 or, v1 = 0 and v2 is a characteristic vector in TD2,0. Thus the fiber over 0 of the first characteristic subvariety is the disjoint union of a point with the fiber over 0 of the first characteristic subvariety of D2, which is isomorphic to a smooth quadratic hypersurface in [formula] by Proposition [\ref=irreducible_case] (iii).

If [formula] factors canonically, then for any s∈S away from the ramification locus of the moduli map [formula], then [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] or the [formula] as in Proposition [\ref=reducible_case].

This is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=ModularTypeA] and Propositions [\ref=irreducible_case], [\ref=reducible_case].

Explicit Infinitesimal Variation of Hodge Structures of the Calabi-Yau Threefolds

In those cases where there is an explicit description of the cohomology with the help of an jacobian ring, it is usually also possible to construct the infinitesimal invariants of the corresponding variation. In particular, it will be possible to compute the characteristic subvarieties. We will illustrate this for the local system [formula] for a good family of double octics f:X  →  S with fibres [formula] covered by Y.

Jacobian Rings

As Y is a complete intersection, one can find a description of the cohomology in terms of a certain Jacobian ring with the aid of the Cayley-trick. Let

[formula]

denote the polynomial ring over [formula] in 12 variables. Let the four quadrics defining Y are given by

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the homogenous ideal generated by the twelve partial derivatives [formula] and [formula], and put

[formula]

There is a natural bigrading on R8,4 which assigns the value (0,1) to each of the variables xi and (1, - 2) to each yi. It induces a bigrading on RY. For 0  ≤  p  ≤  3 we let R(p)Y denote the subspace generated by monomials of bidegree (p,0), that is, monomials whose total degree in the xj is 2p and whose total degree in the yi is p.

There is an isomorphism

[formula]

of [formula]-vector spaces which identifies

[formula]

See [\cite=Nagel], Prop. 2.2.10 on page 40 or [\cite=Te].

In § [\ref=Kummer] we defined the group G1 of sign-changes and its subgroup N1 of index two. These groups naturally act on the polynomial ring R8,4 by sign-changes on the xj,1  ≤  j  ≤  8 and trivially on the yi,1  ≤  i  ≤  4. There is an induced action of N1 on the quotient RY. We let [formula] denote the subring RN1Y of elements in RY fixed by every σ∈N1.

It induces an isomorphism between the subspaces

[formula]

which is also compatible with the Hodge decomposition and the total grading.

By Proposition 3.4, [formula] is the subspace of [formula] invariant under N1-action and moreover is a sub PHS of [formula]. So one has

[formula]

So the assertion follows.

Multiplication and Cup-Product

For 0  ≤  p  ≤  2 the following diagram commutes

[formula]

Here the vertical arrows are provided by Proposition [\ref=CompThm1] and the above isomorphism, and the lower horizontal arrow is the ring multiplication map.

First we recall that in we associate each element in S a smooth complete intersection of four quadrics Y in [formula]. Let g0:Z  →  Z be a good family over the moduli space of smooth complete intersection of four quadrics in [formula]. So one has the natural closed embedding [formula]. Put

[formula]

Globalizing the construction in Proposition [\ref=Prop34] to h0, one obtains a new family [formula] admitting N1-action over S, and by taking quotient of it under N1-action one recovers the family f0:X  →  S. In summary, one has the following commutative diagrams

[formula]

Now we let [formula] and (F,η) be the system of Hodge bundles associated with [formula]. By construction, it is clear that [formula] as PVHS. It follows that for v∈TS,s  ⊂  TZ,s one has natural identification

[formula]

where [formula].

Furthermore, for the IVHS of [formula] at s, one has the following commutative diagram (see Proposition 2.6 in [\cite=Te])

[formula]

where the lower horizontal arrow is induced by the ring multiplication map.

Finally one has the following commutative diagrams by the construction of the families h0,h̃0 and f0:

[formula]

This shows that under the left vertical isomorphism TZ,s  →  R(1)Y (in the second paragraph), the image of TS,s is exactly [formula]. The proposition follows by putting everything above together.

Calculation

Now we proceed to describe the computation of the characteristic subvarieties introduced in § [\ref=Plethysm]. According to Proposition [\ref=PropGM], the action of Higgs field on the cohomology classes along a given tangent vector is equivalent to the multiplication of corresponding elements in [formula] with some fixed element in [formula]. Furthermore, since [formula] is one-dimensional, there exists a isomorphism [formula]. Hence in our case the k-th iterated Higgs fields

[formula]

is given by the multiplication map

[formula]

It follows that the k-th characteristic subvariety at s is isomorphic to

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the image of the dual [formula] of the multiplication map. Fixing a basis of [formula] determines an isomorphism [formula]. This shows that the first characteristic subvariety (C1)s can be computed by the following steps. Let (u1,...,u9) and (v1,...,v9) denote the elements of B1 and B2, respectively.

Fix a bijection

[formula]

and define a basis B  =  (w1,...,w45) of [formula] by wφ(i,j)  =  uiuj. Compute the representation matrix [formula] of the multiplication map μ2 with respect to B and B2.

Let B*1  =  (u*1,...,u*9) denote the dual basis of B1, and let the basis [formula] of [formula] be defined by w̃φ(i,j)  =  u*iu*j. Determine the representation matrix [formula] of the dualized multiplication μ*2 with respect to B*2 and [formula].

For the k-th column of D define a polynomial [formula] by

[formula]

Let [formula] be the ideal generated by f1,...,f9. Then (C1)s is isomorphic to the projective subvariety in [formula] which corresponds to [formula].

Step (1) can be carried out in practice using computer algebra. For each pair (i,j), one computes the product g1g2 of the polynomials gi,gj∈R8,4 which correspond to the basis vectors wi,wj∈B1 and reduces it with respect to the Jacobian ideal [formula]. The result can be expressed as a linear combination of the elements in B2. For step (2) notice that [formula] is related to the dual basis [formula] of B by

[formula]

By a similar procedure, we can compute the characteristic subvariety (C2)s. We skip the details here, because it will not be used in the sequel.

A general point and a special point

Here we summarize the results of the calculations that can be performed by the method explained above. First, if we pick a generic configuration [formula] giving a general point [formula] and determine the ideal

[formula]

consisting of 9 quadratic polynomials. Using a Gröbner-basis calculation one can verify the following (see [\cite=computation] for details):

The characteristic subvariety (C1)η0 over a general point η0 in the moduli space [formula] is empty set.

We will now chooses a special point [formula] represented by the matrix [formula] with

[formula]

The characteristic subvariety (C1)reds0 consists of two irreducible surfaces of degree 6, each spanning the same [formula].

For the point s0 the ideal [formula] 9 quadratic polynomials in the variables [formula]. We analyzed this ideal using the computer algebra system Singular. Via a Hilbert-series computation, one shows that the variety in [formula] has dimension two an is of degree 12. In order to find the irreducible components of this surface, one has to make a primary decomposition of the ideal [formula]. For this we had to use several tricks.

By elimination of the first five variables we obtain an hypersurface of degree 8 in variables z6,z7,z8,z9. By looking at reductions modulo various primes p, it was observed that the octic factors as product of two quartics over [formula] in case p  =  1 mod 4. With some more work one finds a factorization of the octic into two quartics over the field [formula].

Both quartics have a smooth twisted cubic as singular locus. Because the generic plane section is a three nodal quartic, we see that these two quartic surfaces are irreducible over [formula]. The decomposition of the degree 8 surface into two quartics gives a splitting of the degree 12 surface in [formula] into two components, which are surfaces of degree 6.

The change in degree from 12 to 8 is due to the fact the projecting out the first five variables is non-generic. If instead we eliminate the variables z1,z5,z6,z8,z9 one finds that the degree 6 components project to sextic surfaces, whose plane section is a 10-nodal sextic, hence rational. Such surfaces are in fact ruled and can be obtained as join in [formula] of corresponding points on a conic and rational normal curve of degree four and are cut out by 15 quadrics in [formula]. Indeed, it turns out that both components are contained in the hyperplane of [formula] given by

[formula]

By taking ideal quotients one can find a complete primary decomposition of the ideal [formula]. There are embedded components of dimension one contained in the union of the two scrolls.

Proof of the Main Theorems

Let f:X  →  S be a good family of [formula] and [formula] be the associated weight 3 PVHS. Then [formula] does not factor canonically.

Assume the contrary. By Corollary [\ref=CharSubMainCorollary], for any s∈S away from the ramification locus of the moduli map [formula] the first characteristic subvariety (C1)s is then isomorphic to either [formula] or [formula]. In particular, in both cases there exists an irreducible component in (C1)s whose dimension is greater than 2. By Proposition [\ref=Char1Result_generic] the fiber of the first characteristic subvariety at a general point

[formula]

in [formula] such that the fibers of the first characteristic subvariety over the closed points in it are empty. Therefore there exists also a closed point in S away from the ramification locus of the moduli map of f, over which the fiber of the first characteristic subvariety is empty. This gives a contradiction.

Our next aim is to prove Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem2]. For the proof of it, we use the notations as in . We first prove the following

Each factor [formula] has quasi-unipotent local monodromy around each irreducible component of Z.

We put [formula] and [formula]. One considers the [formula]-PVHS [formula]. By Exercise 6.11 (b) in [\cite=FH] [formula] is a direct factor of [formula]. Since [formula] is of quasi-unipotent local monodromy, the same holds for each direct factor of [formula], in particular for [formula]. Thus one induces that [formula] itself is also of quasi-unipotent local monodromy, and therefore so is [formula]. By induction on the number of factors k in the tensor decomposition of [formula], one concludes that each factor has quasi-unipotent local monodromy.

Each local system [formula] admits the structure of a [formula]-PVHS such that the induced [formula]-PVHS on the tensor product [formula] coincides with the given [formula]-PVHS on [formula].

Let s∈S be a base point and let ρi:π1(S,s)  →  Gi be the monodromy representation of [formula]. We put V1 to be the fiber of [formula] at s. Since ρi is a Zariski dense representation into the simple Lie group Gi with quasi-unipotent local monodromy around Z, by [\cite=JZ] there exists a pluri-harmonic metric on the flat bundle [formula] with finite energy, which makes [formula] into a Higgs bundle (Ei,θi) over S. Furthermore in [\cite=M] Mochizuki has analyzed the singularity of this harmonic metric in detail and has shown that (Ei,θi) admits a logarithmic extension (Ēi,i) over S̄, i.e. a vector bundle Ēi over S̄ which extends Ei and a map

[formula]

which coincides with θ over S. Such a pluri-harmonic metric is called tame. In this case the residue of [formula] along Z is unipotent.

From the proof of Lemma [\ref=FactorLemma] we know that one finds a non-trivial component [formula] in [formula]. Since ρ1 is Zariski dense in G1 and G1 is simple, one finds a suitable Schur functor [formula] such that [formula] is a nontrivial irreducible direct factor of [formula]. Since [formula] is semi-simple, there exists a decomposition

[formula]

where the [formula] are irreducible and the [formula] are trivial. By Proposition 1.13 in [\cite=D1], there exist uniquely determined [formula]-PVHS on the [formula] and complex Hodge structures on the [formula] such that the direct sum of the tensor products of them coincides with the [formula]-PVHS on [formula]. In particular, there exists a [formula]-PVHS on [formula].

By the uniqueness of the such pluri-harmonic metrics, the induced pluri-harmonic metric on [formula] coincides with that of the [formula]-PVHS on [formula]. Hence [formula] is a fixed point of the [formula]-action. The Schur functor [formula] induces a nontrivial morphism [formula], which is injective since G1 is simple. It induces the morphism

[formula]

between the corresponding moduli spaces of semi-simple representations. By Corollary 9.16 in [\cite=Sim1], the morphism φμ is finite.

If [formula], then [formula] acts on both moduli spaces continuously via the Hermitian Yang-Mills metric on poly-stable Higgs bundles (E,tθ), and this action is compatible with φμ. Since [formula] is a fixed point of the [formula]-action, the representation ρ1 itself is a fixed point of the [formula]-action. Hence (E1,θ1) is a [formula]-PVHS on [formula]. Now we consider the general situation [formula]. Let C  ⊆  S̄ denote a curve which is a complete intersection of ample hypersurfaces, and define [formula]. Taking the restriction

[formula]

we have [formula]. Now we consider the map

[formula]

By Simpson's main theorem in [\cite=Sim0], there exist Hermitian Yang-Mills metrics on poly-stable Higgs bundles on C with logarithmic poles of the Higgs field on [formula]. The [formula]-action can be defined on both spaces of semi-simple representations on C0 via a Hermitian Yang-Mills metric on (Ē,t). Applying the same arguments as above to the compact case, we show that the pullback of (Ē1,1) to C0 is a fixed point of the [formula]-action. If we choose C0 sufficiently ample, then (Ē1,1) is also a fixed point of the [formula]-action. Again by [\cite=Sim0], (Ē1,1) is a [formula]-PVHS on [formula].

Since [formula] is a direct factor [formula], [formula] admits a [formula]-PVHS as well. The tensor product of [formula]-PVHS on [formula] and [formula] is a [formula]-PVHS on [formula]. By Deligne's uniqueness theorem on [formula]-PVHS on irreducible local systems, the tensor product coincides with the original [formula]-PVHS on [formula]. By induction on the number of factors k, we conclude the proof of the theorem.

Let S be a smooth quasi-projective algebraic variety and [formula] be a weight 3 [formula]-PVHS over S which is irreducible over [formula] and of quasi-unipotent local monodromies. If the Hodge numbers of [formula] are (1,9,9,1), then after a possible finite étale base change the connected component of the real Zariski closure of the monodromy group of [formula] is one of the following:

SU(1,1)  ×  SO0(2,8),

SU(3,3),

[formula],

[formula].

Let s∈S be a base point of S and V be the fiber of [formula] at s. Let [formula] be the monodromy representation of [formula] and G be the Zariski closure of τ. So we have the factorization

[formula]

where ρ is a morphism of real algebraic groups. Since [formula] is of polarized and of [formula]-coefficients, G is semi-simple by Deligne (cf. Corollary 4.2.9 in [\cite=D0]). Since [formula] is of weight 3 and the dimension of V is 20, G is a semi-simple real Lie subgroup of [formula]. Let G0 be the connected component of G. The classification of G0 consists of several steps.

Step 1. Let [formula] be the Lie algebra of G0 and [formula] be the complexification of the differential of ρ. Then the pair [formula] is one of the following list:

[formula]

Here we use the notations as given in [\cite=FH]. The list results from a rather standard calculation in the representation theory of semi-simple complex Lie algebras. As [formula] is semi-simple, we can write [formula] into direct sum of simple Lie algebras. By Schur's lemma and since χ is irreducible, we have the tensor decomposition of [formula] into irreducible representations. Then one has particularly [formula], where di is the dimension of the representation space of χi. It is straightforward to write down a complete list of irreducible representations of complex simple Lie algebras whose dimensions divide 20. For each pair [formula] where [formula] in this preliminary list, it appears in the final list, i.e. χ factors through [formula] if and only if [formula] contains a trivial representation. This can be easily checked by using the plethysm of semi-simple complex Lie algebras.

Step 2. Let [formula] be the complexification of G0. Then by Lemma 4.4 in [\cite=Sim], G0 is a real form of [formula] which is of Hodge type (see [\cite=Sim] for the definition). We shall make use of the list of all simple real Lie groups of Hodge type on Page 50 [\cite=Sim]. In connection with the list in Step 1, one can immediately exclude the case where [formula] is simple but [formula] is not simple by Proposition 4.4.10 in [\cite=Sim]. Hence the number of irreducible factors in [formula] is equal to that of [formula].

Step 3. We start with two factors. Namely, G0 = G1  ×  G2 with Gi simple real Lie groups. It induces the tensor decomposition of real local systems [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem2] there exist [formula]-PVHS structures on [formula] and [formula] such that the induced PVHS on [formula] coincides with the original one. It follows that the Lie groups G1 and G2 are also of Hodge type. By Lemma 5.5 in [\cite=Sim] [formula] underlies [formula]-PVHS structure. Recall that the weight of [formula] is three and its Hodge numbers are 1,9,9,1. Then after a possible permutation of factors the PVHS [formula] must be of weight 1 with Hodge numbers 1,1 and [formula] is of weight 2 with Hodge numbers 1,8,1. This implies G1 = SU(1,1) and G2  ⊆  SO(2,8). This excludes immediately the case (8) of the list in Step 1. It excludes also the cases (4)-(7) by checking the dimension of representation on [formula]-factor. Let us now consider the case (9). Note that the representation Γ02 is simply the second wedge power of the standard representation in this case. By the list in [\cite=Sim] G2 can be one of the groups SO(5), SO(1,4) or SO(2,3). Since SO(5) is compact, it is mapped into the compact form SO(10) of [formula] under [formula] of the standard representation of [formula]. Also one checks that under the same representation the other two real forms SO(1,4) and SO(2,3) are mapped into the real forms SO(6,4) and SO(4,6) respectively. Thus the case (9) can be excluded. So it remains (10) for the non-simple case. Obviously G2 = SO0(2,8) and this gives the case (A).

Step 4. We treat the case that [formula] is simple. By the list in [\cite=Sim], G0 can be SU(1,1) in case (1), SO(5) ,SO(2,3) and SO(1,4) in case (2), SU(p,6 - p) in case (3), [formula] in case (4). Note that except for SO(1,4) the rest groups are of Hermitian type. For them, by consideration of weight and Hodge numbers as in Step 3 we can exclude all cases except SU(3,3) and [formula], which give case (B) and (C) respectively. Finally one can check directly that the real form SO(1,4) of [formula] does not map into the split form [formula] of [formula] under the third wedge power. For this, one can consult for example Example 3, in [\cite=O]. This completes the classification.

Let f:X  →  S be a good family of [formula] and [formula] be the associated weight 3 [formula]-PVHS. Let s∈S be a base point and let

[formula]

be the monodromy representation associated to [formula]. Then the image of τ is Zariski dense in [formula].

Let G be the real Zariski closure of τ. Note that the Zariski dense property is not changed under a finite étale base change. By Theorem [\ref=Classification_of_Zariski_closure] it is to show for [formula] in the statement the connected component G0 of G can not be the case (A) or (B). Assume the contrary and we shall deduce a contradiction in the following. Note that by the proof of Theorem [\ref=Classification_of_Zariski_closure], the inclusion [formula] comes up with a uniquely determined morphism of real algebraic groups [formula], which restricts to ρ0 on G0. Actually ρ0 has already appeared in Proposition [\ref=ModularTypeA] implicitly. It is easy to verify that ρ0 in each case maps the maximal compact group K0 of G0 into the compact subgroup U(1)  ×  U(9) of [formula]. Let Γ be the monodromy group of τ and Γ0  =  ρ- 1(Γ)  ⊂  G. So we get a factorization

[formula]

This gives a factorization of the period map of [formula]

[formula]

where K is the maximal compact group of G. Since S is connected, the morphism j factors though [formula] for [formula]. Thus we arrive at the factorization in Definition [\ref=geometric_pseudo-modularity]. Since [formula] gives rise to the canonical PVHS, the factorization contradicts with the assertion of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem1]. The proof is completed.

The special Mumford-Tate group of a general member in [formula] is [formula].

Let f:X  →  S be a good family for [formula]. Let [formula] be the associated weight 3 [formula]-PVHS of f and [formula] be the monodromy representation. By Deligne and Schoen (see for example Lemma 2.4 [\cite=VZ1]), the connected component of the [formula]-Zariski closure of the monodromy group is a normal subgroup of the special Mumford-Tate group [formula] of [formula], which is equal to the special Mumford-Tate group of a general closed fiber of f. By Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem3] the [formula]-Zariski closure of the monodromy group of [formula] has to be the whole symplectic group [formula], the corollary follows since the moduli map of f is dominant.

Let [formula] be the hyperelliptic locus of [formula] and [formula] be any subvariety of [formula] which strictly contains [formula]. Let f:X  →  S be a good family of [formula] whose moduli map [formula] is dominant over [formula]. Then the restriction of [formula] to the inverse image of [formula] does not factor through [formula].

We first prove the statement for the good family f0 over [formula]. Assume that an extension [formula] for f0 as in the theorem does exist. We can assume [formula] without loss of generality. Let [formula] be the inverse image of [formula] in [formula] and [formula] the restriction of f0 to [formula]. Let φ be the period map of f0 and φ' that of f0'. By assumption one has the factorization

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=etale_of_moduli_spaces] and the local Torelli theorem for CY manifolds, φ is étale over its image. So is the restriction φ'. Because [formula] is of six dimensional, j is then étale. We derive the contradiction at the special point [formula]. We denote by C1 the first characteristic subvariety of f0 and C1' that of f0'. By Proposition [\ref=irreducible_case] (ii), the fiber (C1')s0 as subvariety of [formula] is isomorphic to the [formula] into [formula] via the Veronese embedding. In particular (C1')s0 is reduced. On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=key_lemma] we know that

[formula]

where the scheme-theoretical intersection of the right hand side is taken in the projective space [formula]. Now by Proposition [\ref=Char1Result], (C1)s0 is two dimensional and has two irreducible components which are not contained in any linear projective subspace of dimension ≤  6. It follows that [formula] is of dimension ≤  1. A contradiction. Thus such an extension [formula] for f0 does not exist.

As a consequence we get the maximal property of [formula] stated in Corollary [\ref=Maximality_of_special_MT_group]. This fact shows in turn the non-extension property for other good families in the theorem. Let f be such a good family. As above we can assume [formula]. We put S' to be inverse image of [formula] under the moduli map [formula]. The factorization of the period map gives the morphism [formula] and it induces an isomorphism [formula] with [formula] the canonical [formula]-PVHS over [formula]. Let [formula] be the [formula]-PVHS associated to f. The canonical PVHS [formula] over [formula] has also a natural [formula]-structure [formula] such that over the points in [formula] the isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] is defined over [formula] . Thus we have actually isomorphism [formula]. This implies that the special Mumford-Tate group of a general closed point in S' and hence in [formula] is contained in [formula]. This contradicts with Corollary [\ref=Maximality_of_special_MT_group].
