Introduction

Early star cluster evolution generally leads to dissolution into the field due to rapid gas expulsion associated with evolutionary effects of massive stars such as supernovae and stellar winds. This causes abrupt changes in the gravitational potential, to the point that significant fractions of the low-mass stars with high velocity in the outer region escape from the cluster (e.g. [\citealt=tutu78], [\citealt=felkro05], [\citealt=basgie08]). Bound open clusters (OCs), i.e. those that keep dynamical stability after the first ~   30-40 Myr, appear to be minority of about 5% ([\citealt=ladlad03]). There is a high discrepancy between the birthrate of embedded clusters (2-4 Myr- 1 kpc- 2, [\citealt=ladlad03]) and OCs (0.25 Myr- 1 kpc- 2 according to [\citealt=elcl85], and 0.45 Myr- 1 kpc- 2 according to [\citealt=baca91]) within 2 kpc of the Sun. This is likely a consequence of the high rate of infant mortality. The cluster survival depends primarily on the dynamical state of the stars, i.e., their virial ratio immediately before the onset of gas expulsion [\citep=good09], while the star-formation efficiency has a secondary role. As an example of a dissolving cluster, a recent study showed that Bochum 1 has an eroded radial density profile (RDP) and a detached core, suggesting, in that case, the genesis of a small OB association ().

Young OCs are probes of the early physical processes occuring in embedded and post-embedded clusters. In recent years our group has analyzed main sequence (MS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) stellar contents of such objects using powerful tools for field decontamination (NGC 4755 in [\citealt=bbob06]; NGC 6611 in ; Pismis 5, NGC 1931, vdB 80 and BDBS 96 in [\citealt=bonbic09a]; and NGC 2244 in [\citealt=bonbic09b]).

The development of infrared astronomy during the last years has improved our understanding about the origin of clusters, but there is a lot of questions to be answered yet. Can all intermediate steps of early cluster evolution be tracked? Can evolutionary scenarios be tested? The present work together with other recent ones by our group address this puzzle, which is fundamental for the understanding of star cluster and field populations build up in the galaxy.

Another fundamental question is whether massive stars can be formed in isolation, or if isolated massive stars are remnants of dispersed embedded clusters. [\citet=wit04] and [\citet=wit05] found that 4 ±   2% of all O-type stars with V <   8 mag could have been formed outside a cluster. [\citet=pargoo07] have suggested that some apparently isolated O-stars are in fact low-mass clusters (<   100 M[formula]) with only one massive star. N-body simulations by [\citet=pfkro06] showed that the Orion Nebula cluster could have lost at least half of its OB stars as runaways during early cluster evolution. The presence of bow-shocks associated with massive stars can be used as an indicator of ejection of these stars at supersonic velocities (e.g. [\citealt=gvabom09]), when the proper motion cannot be measured properly because of large distances and shortly separated epochs. However, only a fraction [formula] 20% of runaway OB stars produce bow-shocks.

In the present study, we explore a star-forming complex related to the Sh2-132 HII region ([\citealt=sharpl59]) that embeds some previously undetected clusters. Using 2MASS photometry we analyse colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and RDPs of 5 star clusters related or possibly related to Sh2-132 HII. An additional star cluster projected close to the complex is also studied. A radio continuum emission analysis of Sh2-132 () indicated the giant nature of this complex and its evolved character (low electron densities, large linear diameter and an ionized gas mass greater than 104 M[formula]), which suggests a suitable laboratory for early dynamical and hydrodynamical evolution.

We also investigate two Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the area, searching for possible star clusters around them.

In Sect. [\ref=sec:dir] we present the targets. In Sect. [\ref=sec:cmd] we carry out CMD analysis and estimate cluster parameters. In Sect. [\ref=sec:rdp] we study the density profiles. Discussions are given in Sect. [\ref=sec:dis]. Finally, conclusions of this work are in Sect. [\ref=sec:con].

Newly found and previously known star clusters

The number of embedded star clusters in a given star-forming region is essential to study the gas expulsion and dynamical evolution effects, in order to know about cluster binarity or multiplicity ([\citealt=carva08]). In this investigation line we searched for new embedded clusters in Sh2-132 complex.

We present in Table [\ref=tab:clu] the star clusters in the area of the Sh2-132. The radii given in Col. 5 were chosen by eye for decontamination purposes (Sect. [\ref=sec:cmd]), since they provide a good contrast with the field. Fig. [\ref=fig:sh132] shows an R-band 2nd generation Digitized Sky Survey (XDSS) image of the whole complex with the positions of the star clusters (Table [\ref=tab:clu]) together with the dark nebulae LDN 1150, LDN 1154 and LDN 1161 ([\citealt=lynds62]). SBB 1, SBB 2, SBB 3 and SBB 4 were found by one of us (TAS) using the 2MASS Atlas. The optical OC Teutsch 127 () contains a trapezium system (Trap 900) found by [\citet=abtcor00]. Berkeley 94 was studied with photographic photometry by [\citet=yilmaz70] and the derived parameters are given in WEBDA: age t = 10 Myr, reddening E(B-  V) = 0.61 and distance from the Sun d[formula] = 2.63 kpc. It is important to analyse Berkeley 94 also with 2MASS photometry for comparison purposes.

The Sh2-132 complex includes two WR stars ([\citealt=vdhuch01] - see also the Vizier catalogue III/215). We list in Table [\ref=tab:wrs] their basic properties. They were indicated as members of the Sh2-132 complex and the OB association Cep OB1. [\citet=caetal08] analysed the distribution of interstellar matter in the neighbourhood of WR 152 and WR 153ab with radio and optical data. They found an HI bubble surrounding the ionized shell of WR 152 and the occurrence of photodissociation at the interface between the ionized and molecular gas around WR 153ab.

For the known OCs (Teutsch 127 and Berkeley 94) SIMBAD lists some early type stars (Table [\ref=tab:ear]) with their positions, spectral types and V magnitudes. We indicate the related clusters in the last column.

Fig. [\ref=fig:t127] shows an XDSS R-band image containing the embedded star clusters Teutsch 127, SBB 1, and SBB 2, together with WR 153ab star. SBB 1 and Teutsch 127 are very similar in 2MASS bands. However, SBB 1 becomes invisible in the B-band of DSS. This led us to refer to SBB 1 and Teutsch 127 as 'twins of different colours'. Figs. [\ref=fig:newcl1] and [\ref=fig:newcl2] show blow-up 2MASS images in the KS-band of the embedded infrared cluster SBB 1 and the embedded optical cluster SBB 2, respectively. Fig. [\ref=fig:wr152] shows an XDSS R-band image of the faint compact star cluster SBB 3 surrounding the WR 152 star. Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl4] shows an XDSS R-band image of the star cluster SBB 4 in the outskirts of Sh2-132. Images of Berkeley 94 can be found in WEBDA and XDSS.

CMD analysis

CMD construction

Photometry in the 2MASS J, H, and KS bands was extracted in circular fields of radius 40' with VizieR catalogue II/246, centred on the coordinates listed in Table [\ref=tab:clu]. As a quality constraint, we only considered stars with photometric errors ≤   0.1 mag in every bands.

CMDs displaying J×  (J-  H) and J×  (J-  KS) for the cluster stellar content and field stars for equal area (note that the decontamination itself is based on larger fields to improve statistics) as the clusters are shown in Figs. [\ref=fig:t127_cmd] to [\ref=fig:newcl4_cmd].

Since proper motions are not available for a statistically significant sample of stars in the target area, the field star decontamination approach used in this work is based essentially on photometric properties. Given a spatial extraction where a cluster is supposed to exist, and a comparison field (usually large enough to provide statistical representativity in terms of colours and magnitude - e.g. [\citealt=bonbic09b]), the method compares the density of stars, within equivalent CMD cells, in both regions. To take full advantage of the 2MASS photometry, the geometry of the CMD cells is three-dimensional, with axes along J, (J-  H) and (J-  KS). The size step along each dimension is ΔJ = 1.0 and Δ(J  -  H) = Δ(J  -  KS) = 0.25. The cluster extraction radius is given in Table [\ref=tab:clu] and the comparison field range is r = 20'  -  40'. Basically, for each cluster CMD cell we compute an estimate of the field contamination based on the comparison field. Photometric uncertainties are taken into account, in the sense that what we compute is the probability of a given star to be found in a cell (this reduces to the difference of the error function between the borders of the cells). Summing the probability for all stars, the end result of this procedure is the number-density of stars in a given cell. We do this for the cluster and comparison field cells. Next, the comparison field number-density is converted back into an integer number of stars, which is subtracted from the cluster extraction, on a cell-by-cell basis. Thus, the number of member stars in a given cell is Ncellclean. Allowing for variations in the cell positioning corresponding to 1/3 of the adopted cell size in each dimension, we are left with 27 different setups. Each setup produces a total number of member stars, [formula], from which we compute the expected total number of member stars [formula] by averaging out Nmem over all combinations. Stars are ranked according to the number of times they survive all runs, and only the [formula] highest ranked stars are considered cluster members and transposed to the respective decontaminated CMD (bottom panels of Figs. [\ref=fig:t127_cmd] to [\ref=fig:newcl4_cmd]). The difference between the expected number of field stars (which may be fractional) and the number of stars effectively subtracted (which is integer) from each cell is the subtraction efficiency, which summed over all cells is 93.6±  5.0% for Teutsch 127, 26.4±  33.3% for SBB 2, 87.1±  3.7% for Berkeley 94, 92.1±  2.4% for SBB 3 and 90.9±  7.5% for SBB 4. No star has been removed within the area of SBB 1.

All cluster J×  (J-  KS) CMDs of this sample were fitted by eye with 1 Myr Solar-metallicity (suitable for the Galactic disk in general) Padova isochrones ([\citealt=marigo08]). In addition, PMS isochrones by for the ages 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 Myr, were used when necessary. Isochrone fits for each cluster (Table [\ref=tab:pho]) correspond to a distance from the Sun d[formula] = 3.6 kpc (that matches that of [\citealt=fosrou03]). This distance locates Sh2-132 in the Orion-Cygnus arm ([\citealt=momany08]). Only SBB 4 appears to be closer and is not part of the complex Sh2-132. Isochrone fit for the CMD of this cluster yields a distance from the Sun d[formula] = 2.27 kpc.

CMD results

We detected MS and PMS stars in all clusters, although Teutsch 127 (Fig. [\ref=fig:t127_cmd]) and Berkeley 94 (Fig. [\ref=fig:be94_cmd]) are more populated. In addition, Teutsch 127 may have a few Herbig Ae/Be stars heading to the MS. These stars are located in the region (J-  KS) >   0.75 and J <   12 (Fig. [\ref=fig:t127_cmd]) in the CMD. The same occurs for SBB 4 (Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl4_cmd]).

The CMDs of Teutsch 127 (Fig. [\ref=fig:t127_cmd]), SBB 1 (Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl1_cmd]) and SBB 2 (Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl2_cmd]) show a poorly populated MS, while the CMD of Berkeley 94 (Fig. [\ref=fig:be94_cmd]) has a better defined MS. Although each cluster shows PMS stars with ages <   10 Myr, SBB 3 has only lower-mass stars (M <   2 M[formula]) with ages of 10-  20 Myr for the PMS. SBB 2 has a detached MS and PMS, therefore we filtered them separately (Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl2_cmd]).

The star TYC 3986-341-1 is present in SIMBAD as a member of Berkeley 94 and persists after CMD decontamination (Fig. [\ref=fig:be94_cmd]), but its spectral type is G8III, which is incompatible with shuch a young cluster. The distance modulus derived from B and V values in SIMBAD reveals that it is very close to the Sun and is not part of the star cluster.

Fig. [\ref=fig:ccor] shows the intrinsic colour-colour diagrams (H-  KS)×  (J-  H) for the clusters in the area of Sh2-132. Reddening values (Table [\ref=tab:pho]) obtained by isochrone fits were used to correct the magnitudes with the relations AJ/AV = 2.76, AH/AV = 0.176, AKS/AV = 0.118, and AJ = 2.76 E(J-  H) given by , for RV = 3.1. A comparison with the classical T Tauri star (CTTS) locus (dashed line) obtained by shows that only a few of the PMS stars of our sample are T Tauri stars. Another comparison of the colour-colour diagram with the standard sequence for dwarf stars from [\citet=besbre88] reveals the presence of some dwarfs in all clusters, especially Berkeley 94, Teutsch 127 and SBB 4.

The excess in (H-  KS) observed in the colour-colour diagrams for some stars (Fig. [\ref=fig:ccor]) suggests circumstellar disks, that characterise many CTTSs ([\citealt=furlan09]). These disks dissipate at ~   10 Myr as these stars evolve to weak-lined T Tauri stars and giant planet formation comes to an end.

A comparison of the CMD of Teutsch 127, taking into account absorption and distances, with a PMS template (Fig. [\ref=fig:temp]) built with spectral types, magnitudes and colours of the stellar content of Chamaleon I ([\citealt=luhman07], [\citealt=luhman08] and references therein) reveals that in Teutsch 127, PMS stars appear to be distributed between B6 (earliest) and M4 (latest), while in SBB 2 they are bracketed by G5 and M4. In the other clusters, this distribution is more restrict. We identify (i) a B6 and a G5 in SBB 1, (ii) F0, G8 and K3 types in SBB 3, and (iii) F0, G8, and K3 types in SBB 4. The M4 lower limit is due to the observational cutoff.

CMD spread sources

Open cluster CMDs can have a broader than usual MS because of several factors, such as photometric errors, binarity, variability, field contamination, and the most important in the case of embbeded clusters, differential reddening. These effects can disturb isochrone fits. Photometric uncertainty is a function of magnitude, so faint stars (such as PMS) have larger errors ([\citealt=bonbic07]).

A large fraction of stars in clusters appears to be binary, so that points in the CMD are shifted only above the isochrone, unlike other effects (photometric errors and variability). [\citet=platais07] found a binary fraction of 30% for IC 2391 which has an age of 35 Myr. [\citet=cs2008] estimate in 76% the binary fraction in the Pleiades with an age of 125 Myr. However, it is not yet clear whether the reason for differences in binary fraction among clusters is age or density. Furthermore, tidal stripping tears preferentially low-mass stars from the edge of clusters, so that the binary fraction should increase, unless occurs destruction of binaries.

Some PMS stars of these clusters may be T Tauri and therefore have variable brightness causing spread of the points in the CMD. However, only a few T Tauri stars are detectable with 2MASS in the present sample (Sect. [\ref=sec:res]) because of the large distance of Sh2-132 (Fig. [\ref=fig:ccor]).

Differential reddening is the most important factor in the case of star clusters located in regions with large quantities of gas and dust. There is a remarkable large bubble centred close to the dark nebulae LDN 1150 and LDN 1154 to the northeast of Sh2-132 (Fig. [\ref=fig:sh132]). In fact, reddening is larger in this direction according to the values (Table [\ref=tab:abs]) derived from the maps of dust infrared emission of . To the west of Teutsch 127 is the dark nebula LDN 1161 (Fig. [\ref=fig:sh132]).

These factors act cumulatively on the observed stellar magnitudes scattering the points in the CMDs, but the PMS age spread appears to be a major source of dispersion (Figs. [\ref=fig:t127_cmd] to [\ref=fig:newcl4_cmd]).

Stellar density profiles

In principle, CMDs of bound and un-bound young star clusters are indistinguishable. Structural differences resulting of early changes in the gravitational potential can show up in the stellar RDPs. We may expect that young clusters with stellar dispersion have irregular RPDs that cannot be fitted by any model based on an isothermal sphere (e.g. [\citealt=kin62], [\citealt=wil75], and ).

RDPs were built for the colour-magnitude filtered photometry (Figs. [\ref=fig:t127_rdp] to [\ref=fig:newcl4_rdp]). Background densities (σbg) were measured in the field (r = 20'  -  40'). King-like profiles were fitted for the RDPs of Teutsch 127 and Berkeley 94 with a non-linear least-squares routine that uses errors as weights. The structural parameters central surface density (σ0) and core radius (rc) were obtained from this fit, while σbg was kept constant. The results are shown in Table [\ref=tab:par]. The RDPs of SBB 1, SBB 2, SBB 3 and SBB 4 could not be fitted by a King-like profile.

The presence of the dark nebula LDN 1161 and its obscuring effect is clearly observed as a depression in the RDP of Teutsch 127 (Fig. [\ref=fig:t127_rdp]) for 6' <   r <   11'.

The RDPs of central clusters (Teutsch 127, SBB 1 and SBB 2) overlap for radii larger than 1'. They might represent radial profiles of merging clusters ([\citealt=carva08]).

SBB 2's RDP was divided into two components (Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl2_rdp]), one for MS and other for PMS stars. The total RDP (MS + PMS) is also shown. The higher central density of MS stars may suggest primordial mass segregation with an outer region dominated by lower-mass PMS stars.

The RDP of SBB 3 (Fig. [\ref=fig:wr152_rdp]) results in a dense and compact core possibly sustained by the gravitational potential of WR 152.

Finally, SBB 4 (Fig. [\ref=fig:newcl4_rdp]) has an irregular RDP with some bumps which can be evidence of stellar dispersion.

Discussion

The morphology of Sh2-132, which contains several bubbles suggests triggered star formation similarly to Sh2-284 ([\citealt=puga09]). Additional small star clusters not yet identified are possible in the area of the Sh2-132 complex. A higher resolution mid-infrared study would be important.

Teutsch 127 appears to be a young OC with age ~   5 Myr, while SBB 1 seems to be ~   1 Myr old. SBB 1 is deeply embedded and may result from a stellar feedback of O and B-type stars in somewhat older surrounding clusters. It is superimposed on a probable bow-shock ~   3' to the southwest of Teutsch 127 and WR 153ab. However, this bow-shock seems to have been generated in SBB 2. We may be witnessing sequential effects of star formation.

The presence of the trapezium system Trap 900 in the center of Teutsch 127 will certainly have an important role in the cluster evolution. Trapezium systems evolve into hierarchical systems (with a much larger separation among its components) or even disperse in a few million years producing runaway stars. The oldest one identified so far has ~   50 Myr ([\citealt=abtcor00]).

Teutsch 127 is close to WR 153ab that is a spectroscopic binary with a primary WN6o and an O6I (). Evolution of this WR to spectral type WC and its subsequent explosion as supernova will certainly have an impact on the dynamical evolution of neighbouring clusters (Teutsch 127, SBB 1 and SBB 2), by means of gas removal.

SBB 1 is the youngest cluster in the sample and remains embedded. The residual gas expulsion and stellar evolution may cause an increase of core radius.

Since SBB 2 expulsed its residual gas, star formation must have stopped and its survival as a bound OC depends on the dynamics and evolution of neighbouring clusters and specially of the WR 153ab star.

SBB 3 hosts the WR 152 star of type WN3(h)-w, a mass of 12 M[formula] and mass loss rate [formula](M[formula]/yr) = -5.5 (). Since WR 152 has a relatively low mass for a WR star (the minimum initial mass for a star to become a WR at Solar-metallicity is 25 M[formula]) it can explode as supernova without evolving through the WC type, expulsing gas and dissolving the star cluster very early.

Two possible destinations are suggested for the central clusters of Sh2-132:

Given the proximity among these clusters, a merger may occur, which would generate a more massive OC. As a consequence this cluster would appear dynamically older than the evolution of its stars indicates, that is, with mass segregation more advanced than expected ([\citealt=moebon09]).

Alternatively, the dissolution of the clusters, as a consequence of residual gas expulsion, stellar evolution and dynamics of the trapezium system. In this case, Trap 900 might leave a compact fossil remnant.

Concluding remarks

We report the discovery of 4 star clusters (here referred to as SBB 1, SBB 2, SBB 3 and SBB 4) in the area of the Sh2-132 complex. These clusters and two previously catalogued ones (Teutsch 127 and Berkeley 94) were analyzed with 2MASS photometry and show evidence that the Sh2-132 complex is a site of triggered star formation, as suggested by its hierarchical structure and age distribution of the star clusters. The presence of gas and dust bubbles reinforces this idea.
