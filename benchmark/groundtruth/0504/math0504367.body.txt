Reduction of Rota's basis conjecture to a problem on three bases

Introduction

In 1989, Rota formulated the following conjecture, which remains open.

Let M be a matroid of rank n on n2 elements that is a disjoint union of n bases [formula]. Then there exists an n  ×  n grid G containing each element of M exactly once, such that for every i, the elements of Bi appear in the ith row of G, and such that every column of G is a basis of M.

Partial results towards this conjecture may be found in [\cite=AB] [\cite=Cha] [\cite=Cho] [\cite=Dr1] [\cite=Dr2] [\cite=GH] [\cite=GW] [\cite=HR] [\cite=Pon] [\cite=Wil] [\cite=Zap]. Now consider the following conjecture.

Let M be a matroid of rank n on 3n elements that is a disjoint union of 3 bases. Let [formula] be disjoint independent sets of M, with 0  ≤  |Ii|  ≤  3 for all i. Then there exists an n  ×  3 grid G containing each element of M exactly once, such that for every i, the elements of Ii appear in the ith row of G, and such that every column of G is a basis of M.

The main purpose of the present note is to make the following observation.

Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:rota].

Our proof is inspired by the proof of Theorem 4 in [\cite=Kei1].

PROOF. Since Conjecture [\ref=conj:rota] is known if n  ≤  2, we may assume that n  ≥  3. Let M be given as in the hypothesis of Conjecture [\ref=conj:rota]. Define a transversal to be a subset τ  ⊆  M that contains exactly one element from each Bi. Define a double partition of M to be a pair (β,τ) where [formula] is a partition of M into n pairwise disjoint bases βi and [formula] is a partition of M into n pairwise disjoint transversals. Given a double partition (β,τ), define

[formula]

Observe that if μ(β,τ)  =  0 then necessarily βi  =  τi for all i, and then Rota's basis conjecture follows--just let the (i,j) entry of G be [formula].

So let (β,τ) be an arbitrary double partition with μ(β,τ)  >  0. We show how to construct a double partition (β',τ') with μ(β',τ')  <  μ(β,τ); the proof is then complete, by infinite descent, since by hypothesis there exists at least one double partition. Since μ(β,τ)  >  0, there exist βi and τj with i  ≠  j such that [formula]. Since n  ≥  3, there also exists k such that i, j, and k are all distinct. It will simplify notation to assume that i = 1, j = 2, and k = 3; no generality is lost, and it will be convenient to be able to reuse the index variables i and j below. Let [formula], let [formula], and let M'  =  M|S (i.e., M restricted to the ground set S).

For each i, let [formula]. Then Ii is an independent subset of the matroid M', and [formula]. The Ii are pairwise disjoint because the Bi are pairwise disjoint. Therefore we may apply Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] to obtain an n  ×  3 grid G' whose columns β'1, β'2, and β'3 are disjoint bases of M' (and therefore are bases of M) and whose ith row contains the elements of Ii.

To construct the desired double partition (β',τ'), let β'  =  β except with β1, β2, and β3 replaced with β'1, β'2, and β'3 respectively. Similarly, let τ'  =  τ except with τ1, τ2, and τ3 replaced with τ'1, τ'2, and τ'3, which are defined as follows. Let G'' be any n  ×  3 grid whose ith row contains the elements of [formula] in some order, and whose (i,j) entry agrees with that of G' whenever that entry is in Ii. Clearly G'' exists (though it may not be unique). Let τ'j be the jth column of G'', for j = 1,2,3.

It is easily verified that what we have done is to regroup the elements of M' into three new bases and to regroup the elements of T into three new transversals in such a way that the contribution to μ(β',τ') from intersections of the new bases with the new transversals is reduced to zero, and such that the total of the other contributions to μ is unchanged. Thus the overall value of μ is reduced, as required.

Careful inspection of the above proof shows that it is easily adapted to prove a stronger statement than Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Let C(k) denote the statement obtained by replacing '3' with 'k' throughout Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed]. Then the above argument, mutatis mutandis, yields the following result.

For any [formula], C(k) implies [formula].

In particular, proving C(k) for any fixed k would prove Rota's basis conjecture (in fact a stronger statement, namely C(n)) for all n greater than or equal to that fixed k.

It is therefore natural to ask why we have formulated Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] as C(3) rather than as C(2). The reason is that C(2) is false. The simplest counterexample is a well-known stumbling block that is partly responsible for the fact that there is no known general "matroid union intersection theorem," i.e., a criterion for determining the minimum number of common independent sets that a set with two matroid structures on it can be partitioned into. Namely, take M(K4), the graphic matroid of the complete graph on four vertices, and let the Ii be the three pairs of non-incident edges of K4. Another counterexample arises from a matroid that Oxley [\cite=Oxl] calls J. Representing J by vectors in Euclidean 4-space, we can for example let

[formula]

It may be possible to construct other examples from non-base-orderable matroids such as those in [\cite=Ing].

Despite these counterexamples to C(2), we believe that Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] is plausible. Using a database of matroids with nine elements kindly supplied by Gordon Royle [\cite=Roy], we have computationally verified Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] for the case n = 3.

In an earlier version of this paper, the formulation of Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] did not require the Ii to be independent. A counterexample to that version of the conjecture was found by Colin McDiarmid. Take the complete graph on the vertex set {1,2,3,4}, and create an extra copy of the three edges incident to vertex 4. Call the edges 12,13,14,23,24,34,14',24',34', and let I1  =  {14,14',23}, I2  =  {24,24',13}, and I3  =  {34,34',12}. More generally, as pointed out by an anonymous referee, if k is odd, then a wheel with k - 1 copies of each of its k spokes yields a counterexample to C(k) if the Ii are not required to be independent.

In closing, we speculate that Conjecture [\ref=conj:fixed] might be provable using the following strategy. First, develop a modified version of C(2) that says that the conclusion holds provided certain "obstructions" (such as M(K4) and J) are absent. Then use Rado's theorem (12.2.2 of [\cite=Oxl]), or a suitable strengthening of it, to construct a first column of G in such a way that the remaining 2n elements are obstruction-free. Applying the modified version of C(2) would then yield the desired result. The analysis of obstructions should hopefully be tractable since there are only 3 columns to consider.
