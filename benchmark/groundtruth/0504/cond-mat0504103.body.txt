Comments on paper by B.Lesche (Phys. Rev. E 70, 017102 (2004)) "Renyi entropies and observables"

In 1982 Leshe published paper [\cite=Lesche] on instability of the Renyi entropy. His paper was developed later by Abe [\cite=Abe]. From the time of their publications they are often referred as a mortal verdict for the Renyi entropy.

This problem became the subject of our discussion with Abe [\cite=BashSt] [\cite=Abe2]

Another attack on the Renyi entropy was recently launched by Lesche [\cite=Lesche2]. The most important points of his paper related to the subject are outlined in the following paragraphs.

He considers firstly an initial macrostate that characterizes by eigenvalues aI,bI,...,hI of macroscopic commeasurable observables A,B,...,H. The special characteristics of this kind of state are the following: 1) The number of occupied microstates WI = WaI,bI,...,hI is of the order MN and therefore any individual probability (WI)- 1 is extremely small (of the order of M- N). 2) The number of empty microstates is larger than the number of occupied microstates by a huge factor, which is also of the order of N. Essentially these two characteristics make this sort of state a problem case.

This initial state is of the form

[formula]

where |aI,bI,...,hI,j〉 is a basis of common eigenstates (Dirac's ket-vectors) and j is an index of degeneracy of the initial macrostate.

All Renyi entropies of this state have the same value, which is the Boltzmann entropy of the macrostate

[formula]

Now, imagine that a friend of ours enters the laboratory and criticizes our experiment. He claims our preparation of state may in some cases result in the macrostate

[formula]

with smaller entropy than the main state

[formula]

whose entropy is macroscopically larger than S(B)(aI,bI,...,hI), that is

[formula]

Again the second term will be negligible.

[formula]

or

[formula]

Then, according to Lesche, the second terms of this equations are negligible as compared to the first ones (for instance, with N  ≈  1024 and δ = 10- 100 his argument is restriction to q values with |1 - q|  ≫  10- 22). So, in either case, the Renyi entropy of the friend�s probability assignment would essentially be the entropy of the irrelevant state

[formula]

without regard for the iitial state

[formula]

chosen by the Lesche's friend will fulfill inequalities (17) or (18), but not (13) or (14) with overwhelming probability, if only the friend is not a grandson of Maxwell's demon. So, the Renyi entropy of the friend�s probability assignment would be essentially the same Boltzmann entropy of our state

[formula]

These arguments repel the Lesche's attack on stability of the Renyi entropy.

The similar alternative expansion of the Tsallis entropy under the same restrictions gives rise to

[formula]

Thus, we have get the Tsallis entropy of the initial state.

The above speculations count in favor of stability of both Renyi and Tsallis entropies relative stochastic perturbations of an initial macrostate with the uniform distribution of probabilities of microstates.
