Nature of magnetism in Ca3Co2O6

The one-dimensional (1D) cobaltate Ca3Co2O6 [\cite=Fjellvag96] and isostructural A3MM'O6 (A=alkaline-earth metal; M,M'=transition metals) compounds [\cite=Niitaka99] attract now considerable attention due to their peculiar crystal structure and very unusual properties. A large number of research activities have been triggered by the discovery of the unconventional magnetic structure with strange magnetization jumps [\cite=Aasland97] [\cite=Kageyama97] [\cite=Maignan00] [\cite=Martinez01] [\cite=Niitaka01] [\cite=Flahaut04] [\cite=Maignan04] [\cite=Hardy04] [\cite=Samp04] [\cite=Sekimoto04], reminiscent of quantum tunneling of magnetization in molecular magnets, and also by the observation of the large thermoelectric power and magnetoresistance [\cite=Raquet02] [\cite=Hardy03] [\cite=Maignan03].

From a theoretical point of view, the understanding of the Ca3Co2O6 system is far from satisfactory. The crystal structure consists of triangular lattice of c-axis chains of alternating CoO6 octahedra and trigonal prisms sharing common faces [\cite=Fjellvag96] [\cite=Aasland97]. Both the spin and valence state of the Co ions in these two positions, i.e. Cooct and Cotrig, respectively, are a matter of controversy. There were several suggestions made [\cite=Fjellvag96] [\cite=Niitaka99] [\cite=Aasland97] [\cite=Kageyama97] [\cite=Maignan00] [\cite=Martinez01] [\cite=Niitaka01] [\cite=Flahaut04] [\cite=Maignan04] [\cite=Hardy04] [\cite=Samp04] [\cite=Sekimoto04] [\cite=Raquet02] [\cite=Hardy03] [\cite=Maignan03] [\cite=Takubo05], the most common ones being either the non-magnetic low-spin (LS, S=0) Co3 +oct and magnetic high-spin (HS, S=2) Co3 +trig, or the LS (S=1/2) Co4 +oct and HS (S=3/2) Co2 +trig. Recent LSDA and GGA calculations do not provide clarity: Whangbo et al. [\cite=Whangbo03] and Eyert et al. [\cite=Eyert04] support the first alternative, while Vidya et al. [\cite=Vidya03] the second one. To add to the confusion, all those calculations [\cite=Whangbo03] [\cite=Eyert04] [\cite=Vidya03] predict Ca3Co2O6 to be a metal, in strong disagreement with the experiments [\cite=Maignan00] [\cite=Raquet02] [\cite=Maignan03]. In fact, it has been even claimed [\cite=Vidya03] that this material would be the first 1D oxide displaying ferromagnetic half-metallicity (FMHM).

Another problem is the nature of magnetism in this material. In modeling the intriguing magnetic properties, it was always concluded or assumed that the Co chains behave as an Ising system with ferromagnetic (FM) intrachain exchange [\cite=Aasland97] [\cite=Kageyama97] [\cite=Maignan00] [\cite=Martinez01] [\cite=Niitaka01] [\cite=Flahaut04] [\cite=Maignan04] [\cite=Hardy04]. The nature of such behavior, however, is completely unclear: the origin of Ising-like behavior was not discussed at all, and attempts to explain the FM exchange using an ionic superexchange model [\cite=Fresard04] meet some problems.

In view of these controversies, we carried out a theoretical study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Ca3Co2O6 in which we took more explicitly into account the correlated motion of the electrons typical in transition metal oxides. In this work we used the LSDA+U method [\cite=Anisimov91], including also the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We settle theoretically the issue on the valence (spin) state, and find that Ca3Co2O6 is a Mott or rather charge-transfer insulator [\cite=ZSA] already for moderate values of Hubbard U.

The inclusion of the SOC leads to a series of surprising but experimentally sound results: a giant orbital moment for the HS Cotrig ion consistent with the experimentally observed large total magnetic moment, an anomalously large magnetocrystalline anisotropy important to explain the Ising-like properties, and an unusual orbital occupation of the Cotrig ion requiring a completely new approach for modeling the exchange interactions.

Our calculations were performed by using the full-potential augmented plane waves plus local orbital method [\cite=WIEN2k]. We took the Ca3Co2O6 structure data determined by neutron diffraction measurements at 40 K [\cite=Fjellvag96]. The muffin-tin sphere radii are chosen to be 2.7, 2.0 and 1.6 Bohr for Ca, Co and O atoms, respectively. The cut-off energy of 16 Ryd is used for plane wave expansion, and 5×  5×  5 k-mesh for integrations over the Brillouin zone. The SOC is included by the second-variational method with scalar relativistic wave functions [\cite=WIEN2k]. The easy magnetization direction is along the c-axis chains.

We plot in Fig. 1 the LSDA results, which give a FMHM solution, in agreement with previous calculations [\cite=Whangbo03] [\cite=Eyert04] [\cite=Vidya03]. One should note that the Fermi level is located in a narrow Cotrig 3d band with no more than 1 eV width, which is consistent with the system being 1D. It is then also natural to expect that already modest electron correlation effects at the Co sites will be able to turn this material into a Mott insulator.

Another important point to note from our LSDA results is that for the Cotrig ion, the crystal fields do not split up the 3d orbitals into the usual eg and t2g levels. Instead, it is found that the x2 - y2 is degenerate with the xy, and the yz with zx orbital, as can be seen from Fig. 1(b). In the presence of the SOC, it is then better to use the complex orbitals d0, d2/d- 2, and d1/d- 1. Significant from the LSDA is also that the narrow d0 singlet and d2/d- 2 doublet bands are almost degenerate. Fig. 2 sketches the local crystal field energy diagram. This implies that SOC, so far not included in all the LSDA calculations [\cite=Whangbo03] [\cite=Eyert04] [\cite=Vidya03], could have a substantial effect on the outcome for the predictions on the magnetic properties. An interesting aspect from Fig. 1(b) is the finding that the d1/d- 1 band is split off from the d0 and d2/d- 2 bands by about 1 eV, i.e. much larger than the SOC energy scale. Therefore, the SOC Hamiltonian can be simplified into just ζlzsz by neglecting the l+s- and l-s+ mixing terms. This has far reaching consequences for the magnetocrystalline anisotropy as we will show below.

In Fig. 3 we show our LSDA+U+SOC results [\cite=note]. We find that Ca3Co2O6 is an insulator with ferromagnetic chains (FMI), i.e. not a metal, in contrast to the LSDA results [\cite=Whangbo03] [\cite=Eyert04] [\cite=Vidya03]. We have used U=5 eV for the Coulomb energy and JH=0.9 eV for the Hund exchange parameter. These values are taken from electron spectroscopy measurements [\cite=Saitoh95] and Hartree-Fock calculations [\cite=Tanaka94]. To investigate to what extent the insulating solution is robust against the particular choice of U, we have calculated and plotted in Fig. 4 (top panel) the band gap as a function of U. One can observe that a value as small as 2.5 eV is already sufficient to open up a gap. This is consistent with the system being 1D resulting in a small width of the Co 3d band.The presence of this gap does not practically depend on the inclusion of SOC and is due to the Hubbard term U. We therefore can conclude that Ca3Co2O6 is a correlated insulator [\cite=ZSA] for any realistic value of U, i.e. 4--6 eV for Co3 +.

As far as the valencies are concerned, we find from the LSDA+U+SOC that both the Cooct and Cotrig sites have the 3+ valence. The 4+/2+ scenario (also FMI) is unstable and lies higher by 84 meV per formula unit (fu). The Cooct ion in the 3+/3+ ground state is definitely LS: as can be seen from Fig. 3(a), the large Cooct t2g-eg band gap does not leave any room for a 3d6 state other than the one with t62g, i.e. non-magnetic. The Cotrig ion on the other hand, is in the HS state (S=2). Very interesting is the orbital occupation for this Co3 +trig ion: Fig. 3(b) shows that five electrons occupy all the spin-up d0, d1/d- 1, and d2/d- 2 orbitals, and that the sixth electron resides in the spin-down d2 orbital. This is the consequence of the SOC in this very narrow band system with the tiny crystal field splitting between the d0 and d2/d- 2 levels. When the d- 2 orbital is forced to be occupied instead, the increasing total-energy allows us to estimate the SOC strength to be about 70 meV. As a result, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment can be much larger than the 1 μB one usually finds for Co or Fe ions in Oh symmetry. An ionic d2 state would give an orbital moment of 2 μB, but here we find 1.57 μB due to covalency and small distortions of the trigonal prism, see also Table I. Experimentally, Hu et al. have recently found using soft-x-ray magnetic circular dichroism that Ca3Co2O6 indeed has an orbital moment which is significantly larger than 1 μB [\cite=Hu05].

Adding the orbital moment to the 4 μB from the S=2 spin contribution, we end up with the total magnetic moment of about 5.66 μB/fu. Experimentally, Maignan et al. [\cite=Maignan04] found from magnetization measurements the saturated total moment close to 5.0 μB.

We may speculate that perhaps a small part of the sample (≈  10%) is somewhat misaligned, which due to the anomalously large magnetocrystalline anisotropy as we will show below, will then not get magnetized. In any case, since it is easier to find experimental reasons why the sample is not fully magnetized rather than 'over'-magnetized, it is probably better that the theory slightly overestimates the moment. It would be especially unsatisfactory, if one, for example, would ignore the SOC or assume that the sixth electron occupies the d0 spin-down orbital [\cite=Dai05], giving in both cases a total moment of only 4.0 μB. In fact, as listed in Table I, we find in our LSDA+U+SOC calculations that the configuration with the sixth electron forced to occupy the d0 spin-down orbital is unstable by 71 meV/fu as compared to the ground state. Important is that this analysis is also robust against the particular choice of U made here. Fig. 4 (bottom panel) shows that the spin and orbital moments stay constant within 0.2 μB as long as the system is an insulator, i.e. when U is varied between 2.5 and 6 eV.

The occupation of the spin-down d2 orbital has as a consequence that the orbital and, due to the SOC, also the spin contributions to the magnetic moment are oriented along the z-direction, i.e. the c-axis. To flip both the spin and orbital moments into the plane perpendicular to the c-axis is impossible, since this would require that the spin-down d1 and d- 1 become partially occupied, and we have seen from the LSDA calculations in Fig. 1(b) that this would cost roughly the crystal field energy (~  1 eV). To flip only the spin moment into the plane but keep the orbital moment along the c-axis is also quite difficult, since this would cost the full spin-orbit splitting of about 70 meV. Also a third scenario in which one tries to alter the moment directions by occupying non-spin-orbit-active spin-down d0 orbital is equally unlikely, since our LSDA+U+SOC calculations show that this would cost 71 meV, as already mentioned above and in Table I. All this means that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is exceptionally large, and that all the relevant magnetic degrees of freedom are highly fixed in the z-direction, justifying why the magnetic behavior of Ca3Co2O6 can be well described by Ising models.

In trying to explain the intra-chain FM exchange interaction we also have investigated the antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) scenario. Here we took the chain as an alternation of spin-up and spin-down HS-Cotrig ions with LS-Cooct ions in between. Our LSDA+U+SOC calculations find that the AFI solution, having the same spin and orbital moments at the HS Cotrig ions as the FMI ground-state, lies above the latter by about 12 meV/fu, see Table I [\cite=note2]. As a result, the intra-chain FM coupling parameter of each HS Cotrig pair can be estimated to be of the order of 1.5 meV (17 K), assuming a simple Heisenberg model with S=2. This intra-chain exchange parameter is in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed intra-chain Curie temperature of 24±  2 K [\cite=Aasland97] [\cite=Kageyama97] [\cite=Maignan00].

This result seems at first sight to support the ionic superexchange model proposed by Frésard et al. [\cite=Fresard04]. That model used an ansatz for the Co ions which was confirmed by our LSDA+U+SOC, namely LS Co3 +oct and HS Co3 +trig with the d0 orbital half occupied, and found the exchange parameter of about 2 meV, very close to ours. However, that model considered basically a set of virtual excitations which are purely ionic in character and involve essentially only the Cotrig and Cooct 3z2 - r2 orbitals, in which case the solution should be AF, according to the first Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rule [\cite=Goodenough63].

We believe that the intra-chain FM interaction is connected with the large contribution of holes on the oxygens. On the basis of general arguments and also our calculations, one finds that the actual charge distribution corresponds rather not to Co3 +, but to Co2 + ([formula]=oxygen hole), although the quantum numbers are those of Co3 +. In this case two of such oxygen holes from two neighbouring HS-Co3 +trig form a triplet state at the LS-Co3 +oct in between, much the same as two oxygen holes form a triplet state around a metal vacancy in ZnO and CaO [\cite=Elfimov02]. This allows to gain the full coherent hybridization energy with the empty eg states of the Co3 +oct ion. An indication for this is the presence of a covalency-induced spin moment in the oxygen of about 0.13 μB per ion as well as in the LS-Co3 +oct of about 0.07 μB, see Table I. This picture of the origin of the FM intra-chain exchange should be confirmed by further studies.

To conclude, we find using LSDA+U+SOC band structure calculations that Ca3Co2O6 is not a ferromagnetic half-metal but a Mott insulator with both the octahedral and the trigonal Co ions being formally trivalent, which settles the valence-state issue. Spin-orbit coupling and unusual coordination of the trigonal Co ion lead to the occupation of the d2 spin-down orbital, generating a giant orbital moment (1.57 μB) and an extremely large magnetocrystalline anisotropy (70 meV), which explains the Ising character of the magnetism of this material. The ferromagnetic intra-chain interaction is presumably connected with the effect of oxygen holes in this small charge-transfer gap system. This also leads to an appreciable magnetic moment of 0.13 μB on each oxygen.
