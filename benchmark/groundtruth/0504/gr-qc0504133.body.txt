False vacuum decay with gravity in a critical case

Introduction

The idea of vacuum decay in a de Sitter universe (the transition of the inflaton field from false vacuum with positive energy density to true vacuum with (almost) zero energy density caused by the quantum mechanical instability of the false vacuum) was developed by Coleman and de Luccia in [\cite=cdl] and plays an important role in the cosmological inflationary scenario. It is considered as a mechanism of transition to a Friedman universe in old inflation [\cite=guth] (in this scenario, the rapidly growing bubbles of almost true vacuum are created in the sea of false vacuum; collisions of such bubbles were expected to produce a Friedman universe, however it was established afterwards that there is not time enough for that) and emerges also in the scenario of open inflation,[\cite=bgt], [\cite=lm] (in this case, only single bubble is created and filled by the configuration of inflaton that can evolve classically to the true vacuum; reheating is provided by decay of inflaton particles into other particles via parametric resonance [\cite=lindekofman] at the stage when classical inflaton field oscillates around the true vacuum).

We consider single scalar field Φ with self-interaction given by the nonnegative function V(Φ) - effective potential - that has two nondegenerate minima, one of them strictly positive (false vacuum) and second one equal to zero (true vacuum). These vacua are supposed to be separated by a finite potential barrier. Let V reach its local maximum VM at ΦM. Furthermore, let us denote by H(Φ) the Hubble parameter corresponding to the energy-density V(Φ): [formula], especially [formula]. In order to study quantum transition of the inflaton, in fact, one does not need to have the potential described above, namely the potential may have no local minima (vacua), since the existence of potential barrier is sufficient for this purpose. Supposing O(4) symmetry supplemented by the regularity we get the following (Euclidean) equations of motion and boundary conditions for Euclidean version of the scale parameter a and the inflaton Φ

[formula]

where the constant C equals 8π / 3 and τf > 0 is defined by the equation a(τf) = 0. For any suitable potential there exists a trivial solution of the above problem that reads

[formula]

and is called the Hawking-Moss instanton [\cite=hm]. This instanton mediates the vacuum decay in such a way that the inflaton jumps up to the top of the barrier in the horizon-size domain and afterwards the inflaton leaves (by quantum or thermal fluctuations) the unstable equilibrium and evolves classically to the true vacuum. There are also trivial solutions corresponding to inflaton lying in stable equilibria in the true and false vacuum, respectively. However, under some additional conditions, the problem ([\ref=ee]-[\ref=eel2]) has also nontrivial solutions (with variable Φ) called Coleman - de Luccia (CdL) instantons (or bounces) [\cite=cdl]. Following the ideas of paper [\cite=vj2] (see also [\cite=tanaka] and recently [\cite=weinberg]) CdL instantons can be characterized by how many times the inflaton crosses the top of the barrier. We talk about the CdL instanton of the lth order if the inflaton crosses the top l-times. The boundary conditions ([\ref=eel2]) provide the action of a CdL instanton (that follows from the general Einstein-Hilbert action) to be finite. The action is a very important quantity for an instanton since it determines the probability of the vacuum decay per unit space-time volume in the form exp ( - S) . This quantity can be transformed, according to [\cite=vj2], into the following simple form

[formula]

It is easy to find that the action of the Hawking - Moss instanton is given by

[formula]

Near-to-limit CdL instanton of the first order and its action

As it was sketched in [\cite=js] and finally proved in [\cite=vj1] the CdL instanton necessarily exists for potentials with VM'' / H2M <  - 4 and may exist if V'' / H2 <  - 4 for some value of Φ in the potential barrier. If the fraction VM'' / H2M approaches one of the values [formula], the near-to-limit CdL instanton (that approaches necessarily existing Hawking-Moss instanton) may exist. If VM'' / H2M <  - l(l + 3) then the instanton of lth order necessarily exists. Our task is to compute the difference between the action of the near-to-limit CdL instanton of the first order and the action of the related Hawking - Moss instanton. This task has been considered in [\cite=vj2], but our treatment will be different. By making use of the re-scaled Euclidean time x = HMτ and the shifted inflaton field y = y(x) = Φ(τ(x)) - ΦM we rewrite equations ([\ref=ee]) in to the form

[formula]

Since now the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x. Introducing the expansion of the relevant quantities, including the dimensionless Euclidean action into the series in the inflaton amplitude k

[formula]

and expanding the potential into the powers of y we replace the nonlinear equations ([\ref=ee1]) by the infinite system of linear equations

[formula]

in which the functions n and n can be computed order by order if we know the functions [formula]. Functions un and vn are defined on the interval

[formula]

CdL instanton(s) of the first order in the case with subcritical value of the fourth derivative of the effective potential at its top

Let us consider an effective potential which has, for a suitable choice of parameters, such a shape that the denominator in the formula ([\ref=k2quant]) is negative and at the same time it is possible to change continuously the sign of the nominator. If the sign of the term - 4 - VM'' / H2M is positive, then there must be at least one CdL instanton of the first order, as discussed previously. But what happens when we pass through zero to negative values of - 4 - VM'' / H2M, keeping [formula] a negative constant? The formula ([\ref=k2quant]) ensures that we have the near-to-limit CdL instantons in the region with - VM / H2M (a little bit) less than 4. By the continuity argument, this set of instantons must be lined-up to the "overcritical" instantons existing for - VM'' / H2M > 4. In order to investigate the structure of the instanton solutions it is helpful to use the method of representation of a CdL instanton proposed by Tanaka in [\cite=tanaka]. Let us consider the two dimensional "phase" plane (Π,Φ), where Φ stands for some value (to be determined later) of the inflaton and Π stands for some value of the conjugated momentum 2π2a3Φ'. For a given V we can start the evolution, using to the Euclidean equations of motion ([\ref=ee]), ([\ref=eel2]) for a and Φ, with any initial value Φi of the inflaton and we will come, in some finite Euclidean time (Φi), to the point at which a reaches its maximum. Let Φ+i be an arbitrary value of Φ located to the right of ΦM. Taking this Φ+i as the initial value for the system ([\ref=ee]), ([\ref=eel2]) we obtain the point [formula], and varying Φ+i we can draw the curve Analogically, varying the initial value of the inflaton Φ-i located to the left of ΦM we construct the curve -. Intersections of the curves + and - correspond to the CdL instantons. (The curve + does not intersect itself and the same holds for -).

The existence of two CdL instantons of the first order for given - VM'' / H2M opens the question which instanton governs the vacuum decay. Let us investigate a concrete realization of the kind of vacuum decay described above. In the appendix it is shown that for a class of generalizations of the quartic potential we cannot obtain negative value of the fourth derivative of the potential at ΦM if we require that the potential contains both the false and true vacuum. Let us relax these requirements and consider the potential

[formula]

where g2,g4 are positive constants. The top of the potential is at ΦM = 0 and

[formula]

The choice ensures that is negative. We have performed numerical analysis of the structure of CdL instanton solutions in this theory for values of - VM'' / H2M close to 4 from both sides. The structure of the instanton solution is fully characterized by the Tanaka's curves [formula]. Since the potential ([\ref=ipol]) is an even function of Φ we need only one of the curves + and - (- is the mirror image of + with respect to vertical axis in the (,) plane). The instanton solutions are determined by the points at which + (or -) crosses the vertical axis. The Tanaka's curves + with - VM'' / H2M close to 4 and g4 = 300 for the theory ([\ref=ipol]) are shown on the graphs in figure [\ref=tcfig]. These graphs tell us that for VM'' / H2M close above 4 there is only one (no near-to-limit) CdL instanton, for - VM'' / H2M = 4 lying between approximately 3.966 and 4 there are two CdL instantons, and for - VM'' / H2M less than approximately 3.966 there are no CdL instantons. Finally, the structure of the instanton solutions in the theory ([\ref=ipol]) and the - VM'' / H2M-dependence of the instanton action are shown in figure [\ref=instrfig].

Conclusion

The false vacuum decay in a de Sitter universe has been investigated for near-to-critical values of the curvature of the effective potential. An approximate formula for the Euclidean action of the near-to-limit CdL instanton has been found by expanding the inflaton and the metric into to powers of the inflaton in a different way than in our previous work [\cite=vj2]. We have focused on the case when the fourth derivative of the effective potential at its top has a subcritical value and - VM'' / H2M is running from both sides around its critical value 4. We conclude that there is a range of the parameter - VM'' / H2M less than 4 for which at least two CdL instantons exist. One of them is the near-to-limit instanton that can be described by the approximate formulas, together with its action, derived in the first part of the paper. The second instanton must exist because of the necessity to disconnect the energy curve from the potential when the starting point of the curve moves towards the true vacuum [\cite=vj1]. The near-to-limit instanton in this case mediates the vaccum decay with a less probability than the related HM instanton. However, the vacuum decay is not governed by the HM instanton in this case but by the no-near-to-limit CdL instanton. On the other hand, we have shown on a concrete example that for sufficiently small values of - VM'' / H2M the HM instanton has the least action from the three instantons in question and is to be considered as the instanton governing the vacuum decay.

Non-negativeness of VM'''' for a class of generalizations of quartic potential

We will consider the following class of potentials

[formula]

with n an arbitrary integer and λ and δ are positive parameters. Requirement of non-negativeness of Vn and existence of both vacua leads to the restriction on δ at given λ The width δ(n)M  -  δ(n)m of the allowed interval of δ tends to zero as n grows to infinity. We want to answer the question whether it is possible to choose the parameters δ and λ in such a way that we obtain a negative denominator in the fraction on the right hand side of ([\ref=k2quant]). Negativeness of VM'''' is obviously necessary for this. The top of the barrier of Vn is reached at ΦM for which we have The range of the parameter Z follows from the range of δ, namely

[formula]

The direct computation of V''''n M with the crucial help of the parametrization (λ,Z) gives the result

[formula]

For any given n there are obviously values of Z (not fulfilling ([\ref=Zrestr])) for which V''''nM has both positive and negative values. The restriction ([\ref=Zrestr]) changes the situation. At Z = 0 the expression ([\ref=V_Mingeneralzed]) is positive. The zero point of ([\ref=V_Mingeneralzed]) is given by and we easily find that Z0 never belongs to the required range of Z because Therefore V''''n M cannot be negative.
