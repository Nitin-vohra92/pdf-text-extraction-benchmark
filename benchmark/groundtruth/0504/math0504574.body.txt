Fixed conjugacy classes of normal subgroups and the k(GV)-problem by Thomas Michael Keller Department of Mathematics Texas State University 601 University Drive San Marcos, TX 78666 USA e-mail: keller@txstate.edu 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 20C15, 20C20.

We establish several new bounds for the number of conjugacy classes of a finite group, all of which involve the maximal number c of conjugacy classes of a normal subgroup fixed by some element of a suitable subset of the group. To apply these formulas effectively, the parameter c, which in general is hard to control, is studied in some important situations. These results are then used to provide a new, shorter proof of the most difficult case of the well-known k(GV)-problem, which occurs for p = 5 and V induced from the natural module of a 5-complement of (2,5). We also show how, for large p, the new results reduce the k(GV)-problem to the primitive case, thereby improving previous work on this. Furthermore, we discuss how they can be used in tackling the imprimitive case of the as of yet unsolved noncoprime k(GV)-problem.

Introduction and notation

Bounding the number of conjugacy classes of a finite group is a fundamental issue in finite group theory, as is evidenced by the large body of literature on the subject (for general results see e. g. [\cite=gallagher], [\cite=kovacs-robinson], [\cite=liebeck-pyber], for asymptotic results on classical groups see [\cite=fulman-guralnick], for the k(GV)-problem see e. g. [\cite=robinson-thompson], [\cite=gmrs]). This paper is another contribution to the subject, providing some general bounds involving a parameter that, as far as we can tell, has hardly been used up to this point, but which will prove quite useful. This new parameter is |C(N)(g)|. Here G is a group, g∈G, [formula], (N) is the set of conjugacy classes of N, and C(N)(g) is the set of classes of N which are fixed (as a set) by g under conjugation. Note that by Brauer's permutation lemma we have

[formula]

where the latter is the number of irreducible complex characters of N fixed by g. This parameter shows up in a number of bounds for the number k(G) of conjugacy classes of G, such as the following:

Lemma A. Let G be a finite group and [formula]. Let gi∈G ([formula]) such that the giN are representatives of the conjugacy classes of G / N. Then

[formula]

(See [\ref=lem1.1] below.)

Lemma B. Let G be a finite group and H  ≤  G. Let N be the core of H in G. Then

[formula]

(See [\ref=lemb1] below.)

If one wants to use these and similar results effectively, one must somehow control |C(N)(g)|, which seems to be very difficult in general, and we are not aware of any result on this in the literature with the exception of our own first encounter with it in [\cite=kellerkgv1], where some very technical result on it was proved in [\cite=kellerkgv1].). In Sections [\ref=sectiona], [\ref=sectionc], and [\ref=sectiond], therefore, we will prove some bounds on |C(N)(g)| in some key special cases.

These techniques, while technical at times, turn out to be quite powerful. We will demonstrate this in Section [\ref=sectione], where we will give a short proof of the most difficult case of the k(GV)-problem that has only been solved recently by the combined efforts of Gluck, Magaard, Riese, and Schmid in [\cite=gmrs]. Recall that the k(GV)-problem claims that k(GV)  ≤  |V| whenever V is a finite faithful G-module of characteristic p not dividing |G|. This problem, which is equivalent to Brauer's well-known k(B)-problem for p-solvable groups, has kept mathematicians busy for the past 20 years, and the final step in its solution was a special case for p = 5 treated in [\cite=gmrs] that had escaped all former attacks. So we will give a new proof of this case. More precisely, we will prove (see [\ref=theoreme3] below):

Theorem C. Let G be a finite 5'-group and V be a fiathful GF(5)-module such that V is induced from a G1-module W, where G1 is a suitable subgroup of G, |W| = 25 and [formula] is isomorphic to a subnormal subgroup of L, where L is a 5-complement in (2,5). Suppose that whenever U  ≤  G and X  ≤  V is a U-module with |UX| < |GV|, then k(UX)  ≤  |X|. Then

[formula]

In [\ref=sectiond] we will also use our techniques to directly reduce the k(GV)-problem to the case of V being primitive as G-module whenever p > 247 (see [\ref=lemd4]). This improves and shortens the corresponding reduction in our previous proof of the k(GV)-problem for large primes in [\cite=kellerkgv1]. Finally, in Section [\ref=sectionf] we turn to the more recent non-coprime k(GV)-problem (see [\ref=conf1]), research on which is still in its beginnings. While some work by Guralnick and Tiep [\cite=guralnick-tiep] on primitive groups is underway, nothing is known on how to deal with the imprimitive case. We provide a few first steps in this direction that might be useful in an inductive argument (see [\ref=corf3] and [\ref=theorem7.4] and the remarks following each of them). For instance, we will prove the following.

Theorem D. Let G be a finite group and V be a finite G-module. Suppose that [formula] and [formula] for some n  ≥  5 such that G / N primitively and faithfully permutes the Vi. Moreover suppose that for some constant C > 0 we have

[formula]

and k(UV1)  ≤  C|V1| log 2|V1| for every U  ≤  N / CN(V1), and

[formula]

If F*(G / N) (the generalized Fitting subgroup of G / N) is not a product of alternating groups, then

[formula]

Our notation is as in [\cite=kellerkgv1] and [\cite=kellerkgv2]. In particular, if G acts on a set Ω, we denote by n(G,Ω) the number of orbits of G on Ω and by CΩ(g) the set of fixed points of g on Ω. We will freely use the elementary formulas for k(GV) as discussed in [\cite=kellerkgv1] as well as the well-known fact that if [formula], then k(G)  ≤  (G / N)k(N). We will also use the latest improvement on upper bounds for the number of conjugacy classes of permutation groups. This is due to A. Maróti [\cite=maroti] and states that for every U  ≤  Sn with n  ≠  2 we have k(U)  ≤  3(n - 1) / 2.

On conjugacy classes fixed by an automorphism

In this section we study the action of group elements on the conjugacy classes of some normal subgroup of the group. Bits and pieces of what is to follow have already been foreshadowed in [\cite=kellerkgv1] and [\cite=kellerkgv2], but our treatment here is self-contained.

We start with a general lemma.

For p = 2, the above result turns out to be a little too weak for our purposes, and so later we will have to do some extra work to get around this. The bound provided by [\ref=lem2] is crude at times, and it is tempting to believe that

[formula]

holds. This is not true, however, as the following example shows:

In some sense, this seems to be a rare example, depending on the prime 2, as we see when we try to use the above example to create a more general one: Let q,p be primes with q|p - 1 and let F be the Frobenius group of order qp. Put [formula], C2  =  〈g〉, and let, as above, N be of order p2q such that g normalizes N. Then one can check (by hand) that if q > 2, then [formula], so here |C(N)(g)|  ≤   max {k(U)|U  ≤  F}, and if q = 2, then

[formula]

so

[formula]

The general tools

We now present our inductive arguments for proving results on k(G).

Note that [\ref=lemb1] always yields k(G) > k(H) which, for typical applications where k(H) is bounded by an inductive hypothesis, may give too weak a result unless additional information is known on k(H). We therefore also present another lemma that is more specialized, but possibly more suitable for inductive arguments. This actually is a generalization of [\cite=kellerkgv2]. The proof is quite similar to the proofs of those lemmas, but for the convenience of the reader we outline the full argument.

The final lemma in this section will be useful in certain noncoprime situations.

On the number of fixed conjugacy classes of normal subgroups in certain semidirect products

The aim of this section is to obtain strong bounds for |C(NV)(g)|, where [formula], g∈G and V is a faithful G-module.

We start with an easy lemma.

We next recall an elementary result essentially obtained in [\cite=kellerkgv2]. The version that follows, however, has been generalized to include non-coprime actions.

We also need a result on the number of orbits.

We now can prove an important auxiliary result.

The coprime case

In this section we study what our results yield in the situation of the classical k(GV)-problem. For this, first recall the following result by Gambini and Gambini-Weigel, as stated in [\cite=gluck-magaard].

Note that the A1-bound in the previous lemma, which was relatively easy to establish, is always much stronger than the A2-bound, with the only exception of p = 2, where the A1-bound is trivial and useless, while the A2-bound is nontrivial, albeit quite weak. In view of the applications of [\ref=lemd2], it would be highly desirable to improve the bound for p = 2; the current A2-bound seems to be much too large, and in fact something like

[formula]

instead of (4) should be possible. While our general bounds are larger than necessary, in specific situations, when more detailed information on the groups is available, such as good bounds for k(J), then the formulas (1), (2) in the proof of [\ref=lemd2] will yield much better results, as we shall see in Section [\ref=sectione]. This is already so in case that N / CN(W1) is isomorphic to Sp(4,3) or Z3  ×  Sp(4,3), so that better bounds than the ones in the previous lemma can be obtained in that case, although we will not pursue this further here.

Next we look at the most general reduction of the imprimitive case of the k(GV)-problem that we can get here.

So this is a general reduction of the imprimitive case of the k(GV)-problem to "small" cases. For large primes p = (V), this result even provides a complete reduction of the imprimitive case to the primitive case, saying that a minimal counterexample to the k(GV)-problem must be primitive. This is an improvement of the corresponding part in the proof of [\cite=kellerkgv2]. (For ways to treat the primitive case for large primes, see [\cite=kellerkgv2].) It would be nice if one could refine the methods here, in particular improve the bounds in [\ref=lemd2], so as to further reduce the 247 in [\ref=lemd4] and reach a general reduction of the k(GV)-problem to primitive actions. It would also be interesting to know whether with methods as the ones employed here it is possible (at least for large p) to reduce the problem further to tensorprimitive modules V.

The last case of the k(GV)-problem

While [\ref=lemd4] seems to imply that our techniques only work for large primes p = (V), we will now see that they are also quite powerful in "small" situations. We demonstrate this by providing a new, short proof of the k(GV)-problem in the situation that turned out to be the most difficult in the original proof of the k(GV)-problem and that occupied all of [\cite=gmrs]. Here p = 5 and V is induced from the irreducible module of order 52 of a 5-complement of (2,5).

Now we can prove the main result of this section. Observe that this includes the main result of [\cite=gmrs], which constituted the last and in some sense most difficult case of the k(GV)-problem.

Note that techniques as in the above result also will work in may other interesting situations, such as the ones that were left over by [\cite=riese-schmid].

Reducing the non-coprime k(GV)-problem

In this section we present some ideas that might be helpful in dealing with the imprimitive case of the following conjecture that has sometimes been called the non-coprime k(GV)-problem.

Note that our reduction results used in Section [\ref=sectiond] are not always useful here, because they require some knowledge (by induction) of k(HV) where H = NG(V1) for an imprimitivity decomposition [formula] of V, but in general there is no guarantee that V is completely reducible as an H-module (although this is the case for small dimensions, see [\cite=guralnick]). Whenever [formula], however, then by Clifford V is completely reducible as an N-module, and so we can use [\ref=lemb3] in combination with the following result of Guralnick and Magaard see [\cite=guralnick-magaard]: If G is a primitive permutation group on a set Ω of size n and if F*(G) is not a product of alternating groups, then each nontrivial element of G fixes at least [formula] elements of Ω. With this we can prove the following result.

In view of [\ref=conf1], the following special case provides a reduction to primitive groups in some situations.

Note that if G is a minimal counterexample to [\ref=conf1] and if (V)  ≥   dim V1 + 2, then by the results in [\cite=guralnick] we may assume that t0  ≤  C|V1| log 2|V1|, so that by the hypothesis in [\ref=corf3] may be replaced by the stronger condition that

[formula]

This also yields Theorem D.

A similar result could be obtained with [\ref=lemb2] in an obvious way, but we omit this here. However, [\ref=lemb1] gives a quite interesting result not involving t0 (which in general can be hard to control).

Note that the hypothesis on H in an inductive proof of [\ref=conf1] is satisfied whenever we know that H acts completely reducibly on V, which, for instance, by results of Guralnick [\cite=guralnick], is the case whenever (V)  ≥   dim V + 2.
