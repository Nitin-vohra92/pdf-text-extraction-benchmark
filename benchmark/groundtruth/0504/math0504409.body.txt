Introduction

Let V be an n-dimensional left vector space over a division ring R and n  ≥  3. Put Gk for the Grassmann space of k-dimensional subspaces of V.

If B is a base for V then the set consisting of all k-dimensional subspaces spanned by vectors belonging to B is called the base subset of Gk associated with B, see [\cite=Pankov1], [\cite=Pankov2]. Any bijective transformation of Gk sending base subsets to base subsets is induced by a semilinear isomorphism of V to itself or to the dual space V* (the second possibility can be realized only for the case when n = 2k). If k = 1,n - 1 then this is the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry. For the case when 1 < k < n - 1 it was established by author [\cite=Pankov1], [\cite=Pankov2] (a more general result can be found in [\cite=Pankov3]).

The base subsets of Gk are closely related with apartments of the Tits building associated with V [\cite=Tits] (any apartment of this building consists of all flags spanned by vectors of a certain base). Apartment preserving transformations of the chamber sets of spherical buildings can be extended to automorphisms of the corresponding complexes; it follows from results of P. Abramenko and H. Van Maldeghem [\cite=AVM].

Now denote by [formula] the set of all pairs

[formula]

such that S + U = V. Let B be a base for V. Consider the set of all pairs [formula] such that S and U are spanned by vectors belonging to the base B. This set will be called the base subset of [formula] associated with B (or defined by B). It consists of [formula] elements and its projections onto Gk and Gn - k are base subsets.

For any [formula] the opposite element αop = (U,S) belongs to [formula]. There is the natural bijection [formula] sending each element of [formula] to the opposite element; it transfers base subsets to base subsets.

In this paper we study bijective transformations of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets. The following transformations satisfy this condition:

Any semilinear automorphism l:V  →  V induces the bijective transformation of [formula] sending (S,U) to (l(S),l(U)).

There is the natural bijection of Gi onto the Grassmann space consisting of (n - i)-dimensional subspaces of the dual vector space V*, it maps each subspace T to the annihilator T0. Hence any semilinear isomorphism s:V  →  V* induces the bijective transformation of [formula] sending (S,U) to (s(U)0,s(S)0).

The main result of this paper (Theorem 1) says that if n  ≠  2k then any bijective transformation of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets is induced by a semilinear isomorphism of V to itself or to the dual space V*. If k = 1,n - 1 then this is a simple consequence of G. W. Mackey's results [\cite=Mackey] (see [\cite=R] or chapter 4 of [\cite=D2]).

Adjacency preserving transformations of [formula] were determined by H. Havlicek and M. Pankov [\cite=HP], but the main idea of [\cite=Pankov1], [\cite=Pankov2] and [\cite=Pankov3] (characterizations of adjacency in terms of base subsets) can not be used for the present case and Theorem 1 will be proved by other methods.

Suppose that the characteristic of R is not equal to 2. Then for any involution u∈GL(V) there exist two invariant subspaces S+(u) and S-(u) such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

If the dimensions of S+(u) and S-(u) are equal to k and n - k (respectively) then we say that u is a (k,n - k)-involution. The set of all (k,n - k)-involutions will be denoted by [formula]. There is the natural one-to-one correspondence between [formula] and [formula].

It was mentioned in chapter 4 of [\cite=D2] (see also section 3 of [\cite=D1]) that a subset of [formula] is a maximal set of mutually permutable (k,n - k)-involutions if and only if the corresponding subset of [formula] is a base subset. This means that a bijection [formula] is commutativity preserving (f and f- 1 map commutative involutions to commutative involutions) if and only if it can be considered as a transformation of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets.

J. Dieudonné [\cite=D1] and C. E. Rickart [\cite=R] have used Mackey's ideas [\cite=Mackey] to study automorphisms of classical groups.

Our result says that any commutativity preserving bijective transformation of [formula] can be extended to an automorphism of GL(V) if n  ≠  2k.

Results

If n  ≠  2k then any bijective transformation of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets is induced by a semilinear isomorophism of V to itself or to the dual space V*.

If f is a bijective transformation of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets then pkfpn - k is a bijective transformation of [formula] satisfying the similar condition. Thus we need to prove Theorem 1 only for the case when k < n - k. By C. E. Rickart [\cite=R] (see also chapter 4 of [\cite=D2]), the required statement follows from Mackey's result [\cite=Mackey] if k = 1. The case when 1 < k < n - k will be considered in Section 3.

If the characteristic of R is not equal to 2 and n  ≠  2k then any commutativity preserving bijection [formula] can be extended to an automorphism of the group GL(V).

Let us consider f as a transformation of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets. If this mapping is induced by a semilinear automorphism l:V  →  V then for any involution [formula] we have

[formula]

and the required automorphism of GL(V) is defined by the formula u  →  lul- 1. Now suppose that our mapping is induced by a semilinear isomorphism s:V  →  V*. Then

[formula]

and f is the restriction of the automorphism [formula], where [formula] is the contragradient of u.

Let n = 2k. Then for any element of [formula] the opposite element belongs to [formula] and Theorem 1 does not hold. We take any subset [formula] such that α∈X implies that αop∈X (X may be empty) and consider the transformation of [formula] sending each element of X to the opposite element and leaving fixed elements of [formula]; if X coincides with [formula] then we get pk. Denote by Op the group of all such transformations. These transformations preserve the class of base subsets, but non-identical elements of Op are not induced by semilinear isomorphisms.

If n = 2k then we put [formula] for the set of all two-element subsets [formula]. Each element of Op gives the identical transformation of [formula]. Semilinear isomorphisms of V to itself or to the dual space V* induce bijective transformations of [formula] and the following statement holds true.

Let n = 2k  ≥  8 and f be a bijective transformation of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets. Then f preserves the relation of being opposite and defines a certain transformation of [formula]. The latter mapping is induced a semilinear isomorphism of V to itself or to the dual space V*.

In other words, if n = 2k  ≥  8 then the group of transformations of [formula] preserving the class of base subsets is spanned by the group Op and all transformations induced by semilinear isomorphisms; the kernel of the action of this group on [formula] is Op.

Let n = 2k  ≥  8 and the characteristic of R is not equal to 2. Let also f be a commutativity preserving bijective transformation of [formula]. Then there exists an automorphism f' of the group GL(V) such that f(u) =   ±  f'(u) for each [formula].

Theorem 2 is not proved for the case when n = 2k is equal to 4 or 6.

Proof of Theorems 1 and 2

Throughout the section we suppose that 1 < k  ≤  n - k and n  ≥  5. For the case when n = 2k we also require that k  ≥  4.

Main idea of the proof

Let [formula]. Then [formula] will be called ( + )-incident (or ( - )-incident) to α if S is incident to Q and U is incident to T (or U is incident to Q and S is incident to T); for each of these cases α and (S,U) are said to be incident. Put [formula] and [formula] for the sets of all elements of [formula] which are ( + )-incident or ( - )-incident to α (respectively). Then

[formula]

consists of all elements of [formula] incident to α.

There exists a bijection [formula] preserving the class of base subsets and such that for each [formula] we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

This statement will be proved later. Now we show that Theorems 1 and 2 follow from Lemma 1.

Let [formula]. Take [formula], i = 1,2 such that

[formula]

If k < n - k then

[formula]

Consider the case n = 2k. Since [formula] and [formula], there are not elements of [formula] which are ( + )-incident to one of βi and ( - )-incident to the other; hence

[formula]

By Lemma 1,

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose that g is induced by a semilinear automorphism l:V  →  V. Then

[formula]

and (1) shows that

[formula]

for k < n - k. If n = 2k then (2) implies that f(α) coincides with (l(S),l(U)) or (l(U),l(S)).

Now suppose that g is induced by a semilinear isomorphism s:V  →  V*. Then

[formula]

and (1) guarantees that

[formula]

if k < n - k. By (2), f(α) coincides with (s(U)0,s(S)0) or (s(S)0,s(U)0) if n = 2k.

Thus Theorem 1 can be proved by induction and Theorem 2 follows from Theorem 1.

Inexact subsets of base sets

Let [formula] be a base subset of [formula] and B = {x}ni = 1 be a base for V associated with [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a frame. For each [formula] we denote by [formula] the base subset of [formula] defined by the base B; in what follows such base subsets will be called associated with [formula].

If [formula] then we put [formula], [formula] and [formula] for the intersections of [formula] with [formula], [formula] and [formula] (respectively).

A subset [formula] is said to be exact if it is contained in exactly one base subset of [formula]; otherwise, we will say that [formula] is inexact. Let Rk and Rn - k be the projections of [formula] onto the Grassmann spaces Gk and Gn - k. For any [formula] we denote by [formula] the intersection of all elements of [formula] containing Pi. If [formula] then one of the subspaces S or U contains Pi; this means that each [formula] is non-zero if [formula] is not empty. It is trivial that [formula] is exact if and only if each [formula] coincides with Pi.

If [formula] is a maximal inexact subset of [formula] then there exists [formula] such that [formula].

Since [formula] is inexact, for some number i the dimension of [formula] is not less than 2. Denote this dimension by m. There exists a unique (n - m)-dimensional subspace T such that [formula] is a element of [formula]. We define

[formula]

and get [formula]. Take any [formula] which is ( + )-incident to γ. Then [formula]. Since our inexact set is maximal, we have the inverse inclusion.

Let U and U' be m-dimensional subspaces of V, 1 < m < n - 1. Recall that the distance d(U,U') between U and U' is equal to

[formula]

if d(U,U') = 1 then U and U' are said to be adjacent. The distance d(U,U') is the minimal number i such that there exists a sequence of m-dimensional subspaces

[formula]

where Uj - 1 and Uj are adjacent for each [formula].

For any α = (S,U) and β = (S',U') belonging to [formula]

[formula]

is not greater than k and (α,β) will be called an i-pair if this number is equal to i. For this case we will also say that the distance d(α,β) is equal to i. It is easy to see that d(α,β) is the minimal number i such that there is a sequence

[formula]

of elements of [formula] where αj - 1 and αj form a 1-pair for each [formula].

By our hypothesis, [formula] is a base subset. For each number [formula] we denote by [formula] the base subsets of [formula] associated with [formula].

Since [formula] is a maximal inexact subset if and only if [formula] is a maximal inexact subset of [formula], Lemma 2 implies that for each [formula] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

there is only one α' satisfying this equality (indeed, the condition n  ≥  5 guarantees that for distinct [formula] the sets [formula] and [formula] are not coincident). We set f2(α): = α', then [formula] is a bijection (if n = 2k = 4 then for any [formula] the set [formula] coincides with [formula] and the mapping f2 is not well defined).

The bijection f2 preserves the distance.

Let α1 = (Q1,T1) and α2 = (Q2,T2) be distinct elements of [formula] and i be the distance between them. Then i = 1 (α1 and α2 form a 1-pair) or i = 2 (α1 and α2 are incident); for each of these cases, the cardinal number of the intersection of [formula] and [formula] will be denoted by c1 and c2, respectively.

Let i = 1. Then

[formula]

is an element of [formula] and [formula] belongs to [formula] if and only if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

Q1 + Q2  ⊂  S,

[formula]

(see Remark 2). There are exactly [formula] and [formula] distinct [formula] satisfying (a) and (b), respectively. Therefore,

[formula]

Now suppose that i = 2. Then Q1  ⊂  T2, Q2  ⊂  T1 and β is element of [formula] (recall that n  ≥  5). It is easy to see that [formula] belongs to [formula] if and only if one of the following conditions holds:

Q1 + Q2  ⊂  S,

[formula],

S is incident to both Q1 and T2,

S is incident to both Q2 and T1.

There are [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] distinct [formula] satisfying (a), (b), (c), (d), respectively (if k = 2,3 then some of these numbers are equal to 0). This implies that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the sets [formula] and [formula] have the same cardinal number which is equal to c1 or c2. We have c2  ≠  c1, this means that f2 preserves the distance.

Let [formula], 2  ≤  m  ≤  k. Let also

[formula]

be a sequence of elements of [formula] such that βi and βj form a 1-pair if and only if j = i  ±  1,

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Simple induction.

If 2  ≤  m  ≤  k then for each [formula] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

For any [formula] there is a sequence (3) satisfying the conditions of the previous lemma. By Lemma 3, the analogous assertion holds for the sequence

[formula]

i.e. f2(βi) and f2(βj) form a 1-pair if and only if j = i  ±  1. Then

[formula]

is an element of [formula] and Lemma 4 shows that

[formula]

[formula]

Now suppose that [formula]. If k < n - k then there is unique [formula] satisfying the equality of Lemma 5 and we define fk(α): = α'. The mapping [formula] is bijective (if n = 2k then [formula] for any [formula] and fk is not well defined).

If k < n - k then fk preserves the distance.

Let α = (S,U) and β = (Q,T) be distinct elements of [formula] and i be the distance between them. For each of the cases [formula] the cardinal number of the set [formula] will be denoted by [formula] (respectively). If i < k then [formula] consists only of all [formula] such that M is contained in [formula]. The dimension of [formula] is equal to n - k - i and

[formula]

If i = k then α and β are incident; hence they are both belonging to [formula]; moreover, [formula] is an element of [formula] if M is contained in [formula]. The subspace [formula] is (n - 2k)-dimensional and

[formula]

A direct verification shows that c1 > 0 is not equal to [formula]. Since

[formula]

the sets [formula] and [formula] have the same cardinal number. This means that fk preserves the class of 1-pairs and the claim follows.

If k < n - k then fk is the restriction of f to [formula] and Lemma 6 implies that two elements of [formula] form a 1-pair if and only if their f-images form a 1-pair.

Let [formula]. First of all note that

[formula]

Indeed, we have the following chain of equivalences

[formula]

On the other hand, the set [formula] consists of all [formula] incident to α. Since fk is distance preserving and two distinct elements of [formula] are incident if and only if the distance between them is k, the set [formula] consists of all elements of [formula] incident to fk(α). This implies the equality

[formula]

and we get f(α) = fk(α).

If k < n - k then for any [formula] there exists [formula]

[formula]

Let α = (Q,T) be an element of [formula]. We say that [formula] is a 1-subset of [formula] if any two distinct elements of [formula] form a 1-pair and [formula] is a maximal subset of [formula] satisfying this condition. Clearly, [formula] is a 1-subset.

There are exactly [formula] distinct (k + 1)-dimensional subspaces of V which are spanned by vectors of the base B and contained in T (since k < n - k, we have p > 1). Denote these subspaces by [formula] and put [formula] for the set of all [formula] such that S  ⊂  Mi. Then each [formula] is a 1-subset. Any 1-subset of [formula] coincides with [formula] or certain [formula]. The set [formula] can be characterized by the following property: it is the unique 1-subset having empty intersection with all other 1-subsets of [formula] (indeed, if [formula] is k-dimensional then [formula]).

By Lemma 5, we have

[formula]

for certain [formula]. Lemma 7 shows that f transfers 1-subsets of [formula] to 1-subsets of [formula]. Then [formula] coincides with [formula].

Proof of Lemma 1 for the case k < n - k

Let k < n - k and [formula]. We say that [formula] is a base subset of [formula] if there exists a base subset [formula] of [formula] such that α belongs to the associated base subset of [formula] and [formula].

Any base subset

[formula]

of [formula] defines the frame [formula] for the subspace T. Conversely, any frame [formula] for T gives the base subset

[formula]

of [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be base subsets of [formula]. We write [formula] if the intersection of [formula] and [formula] contains at least 2 elements. For the case when there exists a sequence of base subsets

[formula]

of [formula] we write [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be base subsets of [formula]. Lemma 8 implies the existence of [formula] such that

[formula]

If [formula] then β  =  β'.

It is clear that we can restrict ourself only to the case when [formula]. If (S1,U1) and (S2,U2) are the f-images of two distinct elements of [formula] then [formula].

[formula] for any two base subsets [formula] and [formula] of [formula].

Let F and F' be the frames for T associated with [formula] and [formula] ([formula] and [formula]). First we consider the case when

[formula]

If P'  ⊂  Pn - k + Pn - k + 1 then the condition n - k  ≥  3 guarantees that

[formula]

[formula]

belong to [formula] and [formula].

Now suppose that we have [formula] if [formula] and consider the case when [formula]. The subspace Pi + P' intersects [formula] by a 1-dimensional subspace P'' such that [formula] is a frame for T. Let [formula] be the base subset of [formula] associated with the latter frame. Then [formula], [formula] and we get [formula].

If [formula] then there exists a sequences of frames

[formula]

for T such that [formula] for each [formula] (the number i is equal to [formula]), we have

[formula]

and [formula].

Each element of [formula] is contained in a base subset of [formula] and Lemmas 9, 10 imply the existence of [formula] such that

[formula]

Since f- 1 preserves the class of base subsets of [formula], we have the inverse inclusion.

We define g(α): = β. The mapping g is bijective. If [formula] is a base subset of [formula] and [formula] is the base subset of [formula] associated with [formula] then [formula] is the base subset of [formula] associated with [formula]. Similar arguments show that g- 1 maps base subsets to base subsets.

Proof of Lemma 1 for the case n = 2k

Now suppose that n = 2k  ≥  8 and [formula]. We say that [formula] is a base subset of [formula] if there exists a base subset [formula] of [formula] such that α belongs to the associated base subset of [formula] and [formula]. There is a one-to-one correspondence between base subsets of [formula] and frames for T.

Let [formula] and [formula] be base subsets of [formula]. We write [formula] if the intersection of [formula] and [formula] contains at least 6 elements (if (S,U) belongs to a base subset of [formula] then the same holds for (U,S)). If there exists a sequence of base subsets

[formula]

of [formula] then we write [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be base subsets of [formula]. By Lemma 5, there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

If [formula] then β  =  β'.

We need to prove this equality only for the case when [formula]. Suppose that β = (M,N). We choose three elements (Si,Ui), i = 1,2,3 of [formula] such that

[formula]

and N is the sum of any Up and Uq if p  ≠  q. Since [formula] is a base subset of [formula] (Lemma 5),

[formula]

and any Sp and Uq are not adjacent. This means that β' = (M,N).

[formula] for any two base subsets [formula] and [formula] of [formula].

Let F and F' be the frames for T associated with [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that

[formula]

and P'  ⊂  Pn - k + Pn - k + 1. Since n - k  ≥  4,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and the opposite elements belong to [formula] and [formula]. For other cases the proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 10.

Lemmas 11 and 12 together with arguments of the previous subsection give the claim.
