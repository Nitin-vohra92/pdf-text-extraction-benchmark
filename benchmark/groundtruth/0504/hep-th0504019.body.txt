Introduction

Understanding the origin of fermion masses and mixing angles is one of most important issues in particle physics. Their experimental values show the hierarchical structure. Within the framework of the standard model and its extensions, fermion masses are obtained through Yukawa couplings between fermions and Higgs fields. Yukawa couplings seem naturally of O(1) in a sense. From this viewpoint, how to derive suppressed Yukawa couplings is a key-point for understanding hierarchical structure among fermion masses and mixing angles.

Superstring theory is a promising candidate for unified theory including gravity. Thus, it is important to study which type of flavor structure can be derived in superstring theory. Superstring theory predicts the existence of 6D compact space in addition to our 4D spacetime. Indeed, the 6D compact space is the origin of the flavor structure, that is, the flavor structures, which is derived from string models, are determined by geometrical aspects of the 6D compact space.

Several types of string models have been proposed so far. Recently, intersecting D-brane models have been studied extensively. (See for essential idea on model building Refs.[\cite=BGKL] [\cite=AFIRU] [\cite=Blumenhagen:2000ea] [\cite=CSU].) In this class of models, matter fields as well as Higgs fields correspond to open string modes at intersecting points between different D-branes, and those are localized modes [\cite=Berkooz:1996km]. Thus, Yukawa couplings among fermions and Higgs fields depend on distance of their intersecting points. Suppressed Yukawa couplings can be realized when intersecting points corresponding to matter fermions and Higgs fields are far each other. That is one of phenomenologically interesting aspects in intersecting D-brane models. Such behavior is qualitatively the same as one in heterotic orbifold models. In general, an orbifold has fixed points on the 6D compact space, and heterotic orbifold models have twisted string modes, which are localized at orbifold fixed points. Yukawa couplings can be suppressed when matter fermions and Higgs fields correspond to different fixed points. Indeed, the same technique of conformal field theory (CFT) is used to calculate magnitudes of Yukawa couplings in both heterotic orbifold models [\cite=Dixon:1986qv] [\cite=Hamidi:1986vh] [\cite=Burwick:1990tu] [\cite=Kobayashi:2003vi] and intersecting D-brane models [\cite=Cremades:2003qj] [\cite=Cvetic:2003ch] [\cite=Abel:2003vv]. (See also [\cite=Cremades:2004wa].)

Understanding the origin of suppressed Yukawa couplings is the first important step to derive realistic Yukawa matrices, but that is not sufficient to realize experimental values. Derivation of realistic Yukawa matrices in string models is quite non-trivial. Another important point is to study stringy selection rules for allowed Yukawa couplings. Then we would see a pattern of Yukawa matrices in a model. In heterotic orbifold models, allowed Yukawa couplings are determined by the 6D space group selection rule [\cite=Dixon:1986qv] [\cite=Kobayashi:1991rp] [\cite=Casas:1991ac] as well as H-momentum conservation and gauge invariance. The space group selection rule is the selection rule for allowed Yukawa couplings due to the 6D orbifold geometry. That is quite non-trivial, that is, in some types of Yukawa couplings on orbifolds only diagonal couplings are allowed, but for certain types of Yukawa couplings on non-prime orbifolds off-diagonal couplings are also allowed. Here the diagonal couplings mean the case that when we choose two states, the other state to be allowed to couple is determined uniquely. The off-diagonal couplings correspond to the case that the third states are not uniquely determined. Obviously, off-diagonal Yukawa couplings are important to realize non-vanishing mixing angles in the case with the minimal and small numbers of Higgs fields. Actually, the number of possible 6D orbifolds is finite as determined by 6D crystallographic space groups, and the number of fixed points on an orbifold is also finite. The explicit results for allowed Yukawa couplings due to the space group selection rule are shown in [\cite=Kobayashi:1991rp] [\cite=Casas:1991ac]. Then, in principle systematic study is possible to classify which patterns of Yukawa matrices can be obtained within the framework of heterotic orbifold models. Indeed such analysis has been done for Z6 orbifold models in [\cite=Ko:2004ic] showing interesting results for the quark and lepton sectors.

On the other hand, patterns of Yukawa matrices have been calculated model by model explicitly within the framework of intersecting D-brane models so far. Although explicit models with phenomenologically interesting aspects other than Yukawa matrices have been constructed so far, it is still a challenging issue to lead non-trivial Yukawa matrices. Thus, our purpose is to study systematically flavor structure which can be derived from intersecting D-brane models, and classify possible patterns of Yukawa matrices. For such purpose, we formulate selection rule for allowed Yukawa couplings in generic case. In particular, we are interested in formulating the selection rule, which is useful to investigate whether off-diagonal couplings are allowed or not. Indeed, the selection rule for allowed three-point couplings has been discussed in [\cite=Cremades:2003qj]. We will formulate the coupling selection rule in a different approach. That is similar to the space group selection rule in heterotic orbifold models, showing the condition for off-diagonal couplings. Then we study which types of flavor structure can appear from intersecting D-brane configurations. Here we concentrate intersecting D6-brane systems (as well as D4-brane systems) in type IIA string theory. Since their T-duals correspond to magnetized D-brane systems in type IIB string theory, the following discussions would be applicable to magnetized D-brane systems in type IIB string theory.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review briefly the space group selection rule in heterotic orbifold models. In section 3, we study the selection rule in intersecting D-brane models. In section 4, we consider which types of flavor structure can appear from intersecting D-brane configurations. In subsection 4.1 we discuss the flavor structure, that the numbers of left-handed and right-handed quarks are the same on a T2. In this case, we show the minimum number of Higgs fields is the same as the flavor number Nf, and the Higgs number is generically equal to kNf with [formula]. The selection rule is controlled by a discrete abelian symmetry. In subsection 4.2, we discuss generic flavor structure, that is, the asymmetric flavor structure. In that case, the coupling selection rule is also determined by a discrete abelian symmetry. For the minimal number of Higgs field, we also show Yukawa matrices are non-trivial, but lead to a certain number of massless fermions, and diagonal entries are larger than off-diagonal entries. In section 4.3, we comment on how to reduce the flavor and Higgs numbers, and that would be important to obtain non-trivial fermion mass matrices. Section 5 is devoted to conclusion and discussion. In Appendix A, we give a simple recipe: how to obtain shift vectors, which play an important role on description of independent intersecting points and formulation of the coupling selection rule. In Appendix B, we discuss the possible number of Higgs fields when the flavor number of both left- and right-handed quarks on a T2 is equal to two.

Yukawa selection rule for heterotic orbifold models

Here we give a brief review on the space group selection rule for allowed Yukawa couplings in heterotic orbifold models. That will be useful to study the selection rule for allowed Yukawa couplings in intersecting D-brane models.

Orbifold and fixed points

An orbifold is obtained by dividing a torus Td by a twist θ, while Td is a division of Rd by a lattice Λ, i.e. Td  =  Rd  /  Λ, where the twist θ must be automorphism of the lattice Λ. On such orbifold, there are closed strings, which satisfy the following twisted boundary condition,

[formula]

where vi is a shift vector on the torus lattice Λ. These are refereed as the θk twisted string. Their zero-modes fi also satisfy the same boundary condition,

[formula]

that is the fixed point on the orbifold. The fixed point fi is denoted by the corresponding space group element (θk,vi). The product of two space group elements, (θk(1),vi(1)) and (θk(2),vi(2)), is obtained as

[formula]

Indeed, this product of space group elements correspond to the combination of two twisted strings with the twisted boundary conditions, (θk(1),vi(1)) and (θk(2),vi(2)).

As said above, the fixed point and twisted string are denoted by the corresponding space group element (θk,vi). Furthermore, it is remarkable that the fixed point fi is equivalent to fi  +  Λ on the torus. That implies that the space group (θk,vi) is equivalent to (θk,vi  +  (1 - θk)Λ), that is, these belong to the same conjugacy class. Thus, independent fixed points are defined up to the conjugacy classes.

Here we give two examples. One is the 2D Z3 orbifold, and the other is the 2D Z6 orbifold. The 2D Z6 orbifold is obtained as a division of R2 by the SU(3) root lattice ΛSU(3) and its Z3 automorphism θ. Here we denote the two simple roots of ΛSU(3) by e1 and e2, and these are transformed under θ as

[formula]

The lattice (1 - θ)Λ is spanned e.g. by 3e1 and e1 - e2. The three independent fixed points are denoted by

[formula]

Similarly, fixed points on the 2D Z6 orbifold are obtained. The 2D Z6 orbifold is obtained as a division of R2 by the SU(3) lattice ΛSU(3) and the Z6 twist, which transforms the SU(3) simple roots as

[formula]

Thus, we obtain (1  -  θ)Λ  =  Λ, that is, we have only one independent fixed point under θ, i.e.

[formula]

The θ2 twist of Z6 is nothing but the Z3 twist. Hence, the θ2 twist has three independent fixed points,

[formula]

Furthermore, the θ3 twist of Z6 is the Z2 twist, and the lattice (1  -  θ3)Λ is spanned by 2e1 and 2e2. Thus, the four independent fixed points are denoted as

[formula]

Similarly, we can obtain fixed points on other orbifolds, and the twisted strings also correspond to those fixed points. In the next subsection, we show the space group selection rule for these twisted strings.

Space group selection rule

In this subsection, we give a brief review on the space group selection rule for allowed Yukawa couplings. Here we consider the condition that three twisted strings with the boundary conditions (θk(a),vi(a)) for a = 1,2,3 are allowed to couple. The coupling condition due to the space group invariance is denoted as follows,

[formula]

Simply, that implies the coupling is allowed when the three twisted strings combine into an untwisted closed string, which can shrink. However, here we recall that each space group element (θk(a),vi(a)) is equivalent to (θk(a),vi(a) + (1  -  θk(a))Λ)). This equivalence in the conjugacy class has an important meaning, as shown below in explicit models. The space group selection rule includes the point group selection rule, and the latter requires the product [formula] to be identity.

Here we examine the space group selection rule for the two explicit models, the 2D Z3 orbifold model and the 2D Z6 orbifold model. First, let us consider the 2D Z3 orbifold models. As shown in the previous subsection, there are three independent fixed points on the 2D Z3 orbifold, (θ,ne1) with n = 0,1,2. Let us consider the coupling of three twisted strings corresponding to fixed points, (θ,n1e1), (θ,n2e1) and (θ,n3e1). The space group selection rule requires

[formula]

up to the conjugacy classes, and leads the following condition for allowed Yukawa couplings,

[formula]

That implies that the couplings are allowed only two cases, 1) the case that all of three fixed points are the same, and 2) the case that all of three fixed points are different each other. Namely, these are diagonal couplings. Indeed, this coupling selection rule can be understood as the Z3 symmetry.

Similarly, we examine the space group selection rule on the 2D Z6 orbifold. As shown in the previous subsection, there are three twisted sectors, θ-twisted, θ2-twisted and θ3-twisted sectors. For example, let us consider the couplings among θ-twisted, θ2-twisted and θ3-twisted sectors. As shown in the previous subsection, the θ-twisted, θ2-twisted and θ3-twisted sectors have one, three and four independent fixed points, which are denoted by (θ,0), (θ2,ne1) and (θ3,m1e1 + m2e2), respectively, where n = 0,1,2 and m1,m2 = 0,1. Now, we examine the condition for allowed Yukawa couplings due to the space group invariance, that is,

[formula]

where the space group elements are defined up to the conjugacy classes. The important point is that (1 - θ)Λ  =  Λ. As a result, the couplings among all of the twisted states are allowed, and off-diagonal couplings are allowed. That makes it clear the situation that off-diagonal couplings are allowed, that is, when two or more independent fixed points under a twisted sector belong to the same conjugacy class in different twisted sector, off-diagonal couplings among corresponding twisted states are allowed.

The extension to the selection rule for generic n-point couplings is straightforward, that is, [formula] for n twisted strings with the boundary conditions, (θk(a),vi(a)) up to (1 - θk(a))Λ.

Coupling selection rule for intersecting D-brane models

Here we study the coupling selection rule for intersecting D-brane models. We concentrate intersecting D6-brane systems (as well as D4-brane systems) in type IIA string theory. Since their T-duals may correspond to magnetized D-branes in type IIB string theory, the following discussions would be applicable to magnetized D-brane systems in type IIB string theory. We consider T2  ×  T2  ×  T2 as the 6D compact space, and the D6-branes, which wrap one-cycle on each T2. Other backgrounds could be studied in a similar way, e.g. orientifold cases. The i-th torus lattice Λ(i) is spanned by the basis e(i)1,e(i)2. Thus, the configuration of Da-brane is described by its winding numbers for the i-th torus,

[formula]

along e(i)1 and e(i)2. Here we take g.c.d.(n(i)a,m(i)a) = 1 or (n(i)a,m(i)a)  =  (1,0),(0,1). Namely, we consider the case that the vector [formula] is the shortest vector on the lattice Λ(i) along its direction. A gauge multiplet appears on each set of D-branes. The gauge group U(N) is obtained from N D-branes.

Now, let us consider two sets of D-branes, Da-brane and Db-brane, which intersect each other. Their intersecting number on the i-th T2 is given as

[formula]

and the total intersecting number on the 6D compact space is obtained as their product, i.e. Iab  =  I(1)abI(2)abI(3)ab. At these intersecting points, there appear open strings, one of whose ends is on the Da-brane and the other is on the Db-brane. Such open strings can correspond to massless chiral matter fields, which have nontrivial representations under both gauge groups corresponding to Da and Db branes, that is, such massless modes have bi-fundamental representations (Na,N̄b) under U(Na)  ×  U(Nb) for positive intersecting numbers. The different signs of Iab correspond to charge conjugated modes, i.e., (N̄a,Nb). Thus, chiral matter fields correspond to localized modes around intersecting points. Higgs fields also correspond to such modes. Here and hereafter we assume D-brane configurations with 4D N=1 supersymmetry, because non-supersymmetric configurations are usually unstable. Preserving supersymmetry requires certain conditions for intersecting angles, but that is irrelevant to our discussions.

Here, we study coupling selection rule among such open strings stretching different D-branes around intersecting points. In heterotic orbifold models, the key-point for the coupling selection rule is description of boundary conditions of twisted strings ([\ref=twist-bc]), that is, space group elements and their conjugacy classes. Thus, let us study first how to describe boundary conditions of open strings around intersecting points. Our setup is as follows. We concentrate a T2 among T2  ×  T2  ×  T2, e.g. the first torus, because extension to the case with T2  ×  T2  ×  T2 is simple. Then we consider two sets of D-branes, Da and Db, whose winding numbers on the first T2 are obtained as the following vectors on the torus lattice Λ(1),

[formula]

Their intersecting number on the first T2 is I(1)ab. We assume the nontrivial case, i.e., I(1)ab  ≠  0, and furthermore we take I(1)ab  >  0, because the case with I(1)ab  <  0 can be studied in the same way. One of their intersecting points are taken as the origin of the torus lattice Λ(1).

Obviously, all of intersecting points sit along the Da brane, that is, those positions are written as [formula] with [formula]. Note that the Db brane corresponding to k = 0 passes the origin of the torus lattice, but the other Db branes corresponding to k  ≠  0 do not. On the other hand, all of intersecting points sit along Db brane, and those positions are written as [formula] with [formula]. The former and the latter sets of independent intersecting points are equivalent each other on T2. The equivalence on T2 implies the following relation,

[formula]

for proper combinations of k and [formula], where [formula] is a shift vector on the torus lattice. Thus, the shift vectors [formula] can be used to describe independent intersecting points. Note that [formula] and [formula] are equivalent to [formula] and [formula], respectively, for [formula]. That implies that the shift vectors [formula] have the meaning to describe independent intersecting points up to the sublattice Λ(1)ab, which is spanned by [formula] and [formula]. Namely, the I(1)ab independent shift vectors are coset representatives corresponding to Λ(1)  /  Λ(1)ab. The sublattice Λ(1)ab is not as dense as Λ(1), and plays a role similar to (1 - θk)Λ in heterotic orbifold models.

Here we give a simple example. We consider two sets of D-branes with winding numbers, [formula] and [formula] as shown in Fig. 1. Their intersecting number is I(1)ab = 3. Thus, the three independent intersecting points are written as [formula] with k = 0,1,2. Equivalent sets are obtained as [formula] with [formula]. On the other hand, the sublattice Λ(1)ab can be spanned by (1,0) and (0,3), and that implies independent shift vectors [formula] up to Λ(1)ab are obtained as [formula] with m  =  0,1,2. Indeed, these intersecting points and shift vectors satisfy

[formula]

up to Λ(1)ab, when [formula] as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, independent intersecting points and the coset representatives corresponding to Λ(1)  /  Λ(1)ab can be described by shift vectors [formula] up to Λ(1)ab. See Appendix A, where a simple recipe how to obtain shift vectors [formula] for generic winding numbers is given.

The above simple example also clarifies a concrete implication of shift vectors [formula] for open strings. Let us consider the open string at the intersecting point [formula] between Da and Db branes, and move it such that one end sits on the origin of the torus lattice like Fig. 2. The other end can not sit on the origin, but on the Db brane, which passes (0, - 1), that is nothing but the corresponding shift vector [formula]. The same is true for the other intersecting points. Thus, we can describe open strings at different intersecting points by the following equations, which are satisfied by string end points, [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

when we move one of end points to the same point, e.g. the origin. It is also true for generic case, that is, independent intersecting points are represented by shift vectors [formula] up to Λab, and end points of Da-Db open string at the intersecting point satisfy eq.([\ref=open-bc]).

Now we are ready to study the coupling selection rule in intersecting D-brane models. We consider three sets of D-branes, Da, Db and Dc, with the following winding numbers,

[formula]

Here we do not consider the trivial case that one of I(1)ab, I(1)bc and I(1)ca vanishes. Furthermore, we study the case that all of I(1)ab, I(1)bc and I(1)ca are positive. It is quite straightforward to extend the following discussions to other cases, e.g. the case that all of I(1)ab, I(1)bc and I(1)ca are negative. There are three types of open strings, Da-Db, Db-Dc and Dc-Da open strings at intersecting points between Da and Db branes, Db and Dc branes, and Dc and Da branes, respectively. Let us study the coupling selection rule among these three open strings. Simply, these open strings can couple if the corresponding intersecting points and D-branes make a closed triangle. In other words, the coupling is allowed if these three open strings combine into a closed string, which can shrink without winding on the torus. Recall that the end points of the open string satisfy the condition ([\ref=open-bc]). Thus, the above condition for allowed couplings is written as

[formula]

Here note that shift vectors, [formula], [formula] and [formula], are defined up to the sublattices, Λ(1)ab, Λ(1)bc and Λ(1)ca, respectively. This selection rule tells us whether off-diagonal couplings are allowed or not in intersecting D-brane models like heterotic orbifold models. For example, in the situation that differences between two or more independent shifts [formula] are on the sublattice Λ(1)bc, off-diagonal couplings are allowed. Thus, the difference among the sublattices, Λ(1)ab, Λ(1)bc and Λ(1)ca, is important to realize off-diagonal couplings.

As an illustrating example, let us consider D-brane configuration with the following winding numbers

[formula]

The intersecting number between Da and Db branes is obtained as I(1)ab = 2, and independent intersecting points are described by

[formula]

up to the sulattice Λ(1)ab, which is spanned by (1,0) and (0,2). Similarly, the intersecting number between Dc and Da branes is obtained as I(1)ca = 3, and independent intersecting points are described by

[formula]

up to the sublattice Λ(1)ca, which is spanned by (1,0) and (0,3). On the other hand, the intersecting number between Db and Dc is equal to I(1)bc = 1, and the corresponding shift vector [formula] is obviously obtained as [formula] up to the sublattice Λ(1)bc, where Λ(1)bc is nothing but the torus lattice, i.e. Λ(1)bc  =  Λ(1). In this model, couplings among all the states are allowed. More explicitly, the following Yukawa couplings,

[formula]

are allowed for any [formula] and k, where [formula] denote chiral matter fields corresponding to the Da-Db open strings and the other notation of fields, Ck(ca) and C(bc), have a similar meaning. Here we have assumed that all of intersecting numbers on the second and third tori are equal to one. The strength of Yukawa couplings is calculated through CFT technique in [\cite=Cremades:2003qj] [\cite=Cvetic:2003ch] [\cite=Abel:2003vv], and its dominant factor is obtained as

[formula]

where Scl denotes the action of the classical string solution Xcl, which has the asymptotic behavior corresponding to local open string modes near intersecting points, and that is obtained as the triangle area Σi, which string sweeps to couple on the i-th T2. Here, we consider only the dominant contribution due to the minimal classical action, although other classical solutions also have sub-dominant contributions. That is because we are interested in the hierarchical form of Yukawa matrices. It is possible to extend the following discussions on possible forms of Yukawa matrices to full results including all of classical solutions [\cite=Cremades:2003qj] [\cite=Cvetic:2003ch] [\cite=Abel:2003vv].

For example, in the configuration that three sets of D-branes, Da, Db and Dc, intersect at the same point, "the origin" of the torus lattice, we evaluate

[formula]

Here, the parameter ε denotes the suppression factor for the Yukawa coupling corresponding to the minimum triangle. For explicit calculations of Yukawa couplings, it is simple to use a figure like Fig. 3, in particular in the case that the number of either Higgs field or matter field is equal to one. Fig. 3 shows the above D-brane configuration, where the single C(bc) field is located at the origin. Several vertical branes correspond to Da branes. Intersecting points between Da and Db are labeled by integer [formula] (mod 2), while intersecting points between Da and Dc are labeled by integer k (mod 3). Indeed, off-diagonal couplings are allowed, because all of combinations [formula] can be connected by the Da brane in Fig. 3. If I(1)ab and I(1)ca had g.c.d.(I(1)ab,I(1)ca)  ≠  1, all of combinations [formula] could not be connected by the Da brane in a figure like Fig. 3.

Even if the three D-branes do not intersect at the same point like Fig. 4, the coupling selection rule is the same, because the shift vectors do not change. However, Yukawa matrix becomes

[formula]

where d is a continuous parameter (- 1  ≤  d  ≤  1).

This example shows an important aspect of the coupling selection rule, that is, all of couplings are allowed for any D-brane configuration with

[formula]

This rule can be understood simply by drawing a figure like Fig. 3, by which we can see all of combinations of intersecting points are connected by the same type of D-branes. That can also be explained as follows. Suppose that

[formula]

Then, the sublattice Λ(1)ab is spanned by (1,J(1)ab) and (0,I(1)ab), and the sublattice Λ(1)ca is spanned by (1,J(1)ca) and (0,I(1)ca), where J(1)ab and J(1)ca are certain integers, but irrelevant to our discussions. (See Appendix A.1.) Similarly, the sublattice Λ(1)bc is spanned by (1,J(1)bc) and (0,I(1)bc). It is obvious that the combination among the sublattices Λ(1)ab,Λ(1)ca and Λ(1)bc corresponds to the torus lattice Λ(1), i.e. [formula], when eq.([\ref=co-prime]) is satisfied. That implies that all of couplings are allowed for any D-brane configuration with eq.([\ref=co-prime]). In generic winding numbers, the sublattice Λ(1)ab is spanned by (kab,J(1)ab) and (0,k'ab), and the sublattice Λ(1)ca is spanned by (kca,J(1)ca) and (0,k'ca). (See Appendix A.2.) Moreover, the lattice Λ(1)bc is spanned by (kbc,J(1)bc) and (0,k'bc). Eq.([\ref=co-prime]) implies that

[formula]

where I(1)ab = kabk'ab, I(1)ca = kcak'ca and I(1)bc = kbck'bc. That leads to the fact that the combination among the sublattices Λ(1)ab,Λ(1)ca and Λ(1)bc corresponds to the torus lattice Λ(1), i.e. [formula]. That implies that all of couplings are allowed for any D-brane configuration with eq.([\ref=co-prime]), and that has been shown already in [\cite=Cremades:2003qj] through a different approach. This rule will be extended into generic case when we find generic D-brane configurations in subsection 4.2.

The extension to the selection rule for generic n-point couplings is straightforward. We consider n sets of Di branes for [formula]. Such setup may include open strings at intersecting points between Di and Di + 1 branes as well as open strings between Dn and D1 branes. Their intersecting points are described by shift vectors [formula] as well as [formula]. Then, the condition for allowed couplings is written as

[formula]

Here, recall that the shift vectors [formula] are defined up to the lattice Λi,i + 1, whose definition is the same as Λab.

Finally we comment on the coupling selection rule due to the H-momentum conservation. Within the bosonized formulation, the (twisted) RNS fermionic strings are written as

[formula]

where Hi are 2D bosonized fields and qi are the so-called H-momenta. If I(i)ab  >  0, massless space-time spinors corresponding to R modes and massless space-time scalars corresponding to NS modes have the following H-momenta

[formula]

respectively, where θ(i)abπ (0  <  θ(i)ab  <  1) denotes the intersecting angle on the i-th T2 between Da and Db branes. Now, let us consider the H-momentum conservation for Yukawa couplings among two fermions and a single scalar field, which are originated from Da-Db, Db-Dc and Dc-Da open strings. The H-momentum conservation requires that

[formula]

That implies that the sum of exterior angles of triangle must be equal to 2π. Obviously, that is satisfied with a closed triangle. However, if one of intersecting numbers, e.g. I(1)ab, is negative, the massless mode has the H-momentum opposite to eq.([\ref=H-momenta]). In this case, the H-momentum conservation must not be satisfied with a closed triangle configuration of D-branes. Moreover, if all of intersecting numbers are negative, the H-momentum conservation is satisfied with a closed triangle configuration of D-branes. Thus, the H-momentum conservation is satisfied only when all of intersecting numbers, I(i)ab, I(i)bc and I(i)ca, have the same sign on each i-th T2. That includes the condition that all of total intersecting numbers, Iab, Ibc and Ica, must have the same sign. Since that means the corresponding Yukawa couplings are (Na,N̄b,1)(1,Nb,N̄c)(N̄a,1,Nc) type or its conjugate, the condition due to H-momentum conservation includes the condition that the Yukawa couplings must be gauge invariant.

Flavor structure from intersecting D-brane configurations

In this section, we study systematically flavor structures, which can appear from intersecting D-brane configurations. The flavor structure on T2  ×  T2  ×  T2 is a direct product of the flavor structure on each T2. Thus, we mainly investigate the flavor structures from intersecting D-brane configurations on each T2. In subsection 4.1, we study the symmetric flavor structure, that is, the intersecting numbers for left and right-handed quarks are the same on T2. In subsection 4.2, we study the asymmetric flavor structure, that is, the intersecting numbers for left and right-handed quarks are different each other on T2, but their total numbers on T2  ×  T2  ×  T2 are the same.

Symmetric flavor structure

Here we investigate the D-brane configurations leading to the symmetric flavor structure, that is, the intersecting numbers for left and right-handed quarks are the same on T2. Suppose that the flavor number is equal to Nf, e.g. on the first T2 while their intersecting numbers on the other T2  ×  T2 are equal to one. Then, easily we can show the number of Higgs fields, which can have allowed 3-point couplings with these quarks, is equal to kNf, where [formula] and Nf  ≠  2. Let us consider three sets of D-branes, DC, DL and DR branes with the following winding numbers,

[formula]

In this subsection, we omit the index (1) denoting the first T2, because we discuss the D-brane configurations only on the first T2. Open strings between DC and DL (DR) correspond to left-handed (right-handed) quarks QL (QR), and open strings between DL and DR correspond to modes, which can have allowed 3-point couplings with left and right-handed quarks, that is, Higgs fields H. Then, we consider the symmetric flavor structure,

[formula]

Through a simple algebraic calculation, that implies that

[formula]

where k is a real number. The sign in l.h.s. depends on the signs of ICL and IRC. Recall here that [formula] is the shortest vector on Λ along its direction. That implies that k must be integer. Thus, we obtain the number of Higgs fields

[formula]

Namely, the minimum number of Higgs fields is equal to Nf. In this case, we find

[formula]

and the varieties of shift vectors, [formula], [formula] and [formula] are the same. Thus, this type of D-brane configurations lead to only diagonal couplings for one of Nf Higgs fields. Indeed, the selection rule is determined by the discrete abelian symmetry.

As an illustrating example, we consider the case of Nf = 3, e.g. with the following winding numbers,

[formula]

Indeed, this configuration leads to ICL = IRC = ILR = 3. All of the sublattices, ΛCL, ΛRC and ΛLR, are the same, and spanned by (1,0) and (0,3). The intersecting points of these D-branes are described by the shift vectors,

[formula]

where kCL,kRC,kLR = 0,1,2 (mod 3). Thus, the coupling selection rule ([\ref=selection-rule]) leads to

[formula]

This selection rule is the same as one in the 2D Z3 orbifold, and is described by the Z3 symmetry, under which the fields Φk with the Z3 charge k transform as

[formula]

where k = 0,1,2. Thus, only diagonal couplings are allowed for one of three Higgs fields. Explicitly, in the case that the three D-branes intersect at the same point, we obtain the Yukawa matrix,

[formula]

where ε is the suppression factor. This form of Yukawa coupling is generic form when the three sets of D-branes intersect at the same point, although we have shown the explicit winding numbers. When ε is sufficiently suppressed, its three eigenvalues are obtained by vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the Higgs fields, vi  =  〈Hi〉, for i = 0,1,2, and its diagonalizing matrix is obtained as

[formula]

We apply the above Yukawa matrix to the up and down sectors of quarks with Higgs fields H(u,d)i and suppression factors εu,d. The quark mass ratios are obtained as

[formula]

Moreover, the mixing angles are predicted as

[formula]

by the two parameters εu,d. This prediction does not fit the experimental values.

When the three sets of D-branes do not intersect at the same point, the Yukawa matrix becomes

[formula]

where d is a continuous parameter ( - 1  ≤  d  ≤  1) to denote the nearest distance among three types of intersecting points. This is generic form of Yukawa matrix for the symmetric flavor structure with Nf = 3 flavor and the three Higgs fields. Application of this form to the up and down sectors of quarks does not seem to lead to fully realistic results [\cite=Chamoun:2003pf].

Similarly we can discuss the D-brane configurations with more than three Higgs fields, i.e. the case with the Nfk Higgs fields for k > 1. In this case, the sublattices ΛCL and ΛRC are still the same and these are spanned by [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand, the sublattice ΛLR is spanned by [formula] and [formula], and is less dense than ΛCL and ΛRC. That implies the number of coset representatives corresponding to Λ  /  ΛLR is k times as large as one of Λ  /  ΛCL and Λ  /  ΛRC, that is, the independent set of intersecting points for the Higgs fields is described by the joint of sets of shift vectors [formula] for [formula], while the independent set of intersecting points for left and right-handed quarks is described by the set of shift vectors [formula]. However, the part [formula] is irrelevant to the coupling selection rule, that is, the selection rule is determined by the same ZNf symmetry, and the part [formula] has the trivial charge under the ZNf symmetry. As a result, the same couplings are allowed except replacing

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Higgs field corresponding to the shift vector [formula] and we have omitted coefficients. As a result, only diagonal couplings are allowed for one of Higgs fields.

Here we give an explicit model with Nf flavors and 2Nf Higgs fields. In this case we have the following Yukawa matrix,

[formula]

when all of three sets of D-brane intersect at the same point.

Including many Higgs fields may lead to realistic Yukawa matrices for the quark and lepton sectors, when we assume proper VEVs for these Higgs fields. However, that raises another question: how can we realize such proper ratios of Higgs VEVs.

Asymmetric flavor structure

Here we study the asymmetric flavor structure on T2, that is, the numbers of left and right-handed quarks are different each other, e.g. on the first T2, i.e. |I(1)CL|  ≠  |I(1)RC|. The total number of left and right-handed quarks must be the same. Thus, intersecting points, e.g. on the second T2, must satisfy |I(1)CLI(2)CL|  =  |I(1)RCI(2)RC|, and the total flavor number is equal to Nf = |I(1)CLI(2)CL| = |I(1)RCI(2)RC|.

First, let us investigate which types of D-brane configurations can appear. Again, we consider three sets of D-branes, DC, DL and DR branes with the following winding numbers on the first T2,

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]. Through a simple algebraic calculation, we can show

[formula]

where j is integer. Then, we can calculate

[formula]

Here the integer j must satisfy

[formula]

For example, if [formula], the above discussion could be applied to show that r = C'r' with integer r'. That is inconsistent with the above condition [formula]. Thus, the generic D-brane configuration should satisfy

[formula]

We have understood the generic D-brane configuration. Now, let us consider the selection rule for such generic case. In section 3, we have shown that all of couplings are allowed in the D-brane configuration satisfying eq.([\ref=co-prime]). Here we extend that into the generic case. We take C as the greatest common divisor of any two intersecting numbers. Suppose that g.c.d.(n(1)1,n(1)2) = g.c.d.(n(1)1,n(1)3) = g.c.d.(n(1)2,n(1)3) = 1. Then, the sublattices are spanned by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and J(1)CL, J(1)RC and J(1)LR are certain integeres, but irrelevant to our discussions. In this case, the combination of the sublattices, ΛCL,ΛRC and ΛLR corresponds to the sublattice, which is spanned by (1,0) and (0,C). Therefore, the coupling selection rule is determined by the discrete ZC symmetry. Let us write this generic result on the coupling selection rule in simple words. When we label intersecting points by jCL, jRC and jLR, i.e.,

[formula]

the coupling selection rule is obtained as

[formula]

where

[formula]

for g.c.d.(n(1)1,n(1)2) = g.c.d.(n(1)1,n(1)3) = g.c.d.(n(1)2,n(1)3) = 1. This selection rule is mentioned also in [\cite=Cremades:2003qj] as Ansatz.

In generic case, the sublattices are spanned by

[formula]

where C1C2 = C and

[formula]

Then, the combination of the sublattices, ΛCL,ΛRC and ΛLR corresponds to the sublattice, which is spanned by (C1,0) and (0,C2). Hence, the coupling selection rule is determined by the ZC1  ×  ZC2 symmetry. This selection rule is also written as a simple extension of eq.([\ref=ZC-symmetry]).

We have understood the generic D-brane configuration and its coupling selection rule. From phenomenological viewpoint, we are interested in D-brane configurations leading to small numbers of flavors, in particular the flavor number equal to three. The D-brane configuration leading to the total flavor number Nf = 3 is realized by the intersecting numbers,

[formula]

Suppose that I(1)LRI(2)LR  =  1, that is, the number of Higgs fields is equal to one. In this case, we have the factorizable form of the Yukawa matrix,

[formula]

as already known in the literature. That is the rank-one matrix, and that makes only one of flavor massive, and the others remain massless still with obviously vanishing mixing angles.

The minimal case, which can lead to non-vanishing mixing with only one Higgs field, may be the D-brane configuration with the intersecting numbers,

[formula]

The total flavor number Nf is equal to Nf  =  6, and left and right-handed quarks are denoted by QijL and [formula], respectively, where the indices (i,j) label intersecting points on the first and second tori for i = 0,1,2 and j = 0,1. The indices [formula] have the same meaning. In this case with one Higgs field, the total Yukawa matrix is obtained as a direct product of the parts from the first and second tori, i.e.,

[formula]

The generic form of aik and [formula] is obtained by eqs.([\ref=asym-1]), ([\ref=asym-2]) with different suppression factors ε and ε'. Thus, this Yukawa matrix [formula] has the non-trivial form with the rank-four, that is, the mass ratios among massive modes and diagonalizing matrix elements are determined by geometrical aspects. However, when we apply this form to up and down sectors of quarks, it can not realize experimental values of masses and mixing angles. The clear problem is that the flavor number is larger and two flavors remain still massless. Also, another phenomenological aspect is that off-diagonal entries are suppressed compared with diagonal entries. However, experimental values of mass ratios and mixing angles in the quark sector as well as the lepton sector satisfy mi / mj  ≤  Vij for i < j, and that implies off-diagonal entries must not be suppressed so much in one of up and down sectors.

The generic aspects of the asymmetric flavor structure with the intersecting numbers (I(1)CL,I(1)RC)(I(2)CL,I(2)RC), which satisfy I(1)CL  =  I(2)RC and I(1)RC  =  I(2)CL, is as follows. Here we consider the case that g.c.d.(I(1)CL,I(1)RC) = 1. The extension to the case with g.c.d.(I(1)CL,I(1)RC)  ≠  1 is simple. We denote left and right-handed quarks by QijL and [formula], respectively, for [formula] and [formula]. We suppose the minimal number of Higgs field. In this case, the full Yukawa matrix is obtained as a direct product,

[formula]

When all of three sets of D-branes intersect at the same point, the factor matrix corresponding to the first T2, aik, is derived through a simple calculation,

[formula]

where m is the integer satisfy

[formula]

with the minimum |m|, where m includes negative integers. This result may be obvious when we draw a figure like Fig. 3. The matrix [formula] is also obtained in a similar way. When all of three sets of D-brane do not intersect at the same point, the factor matrix aik is obtained in the same way except by replacing m  →  m - d, where d is a continuous parameter ( - 1  ≤  d  ≤  1).

The total flavor number Nf is obtained as Nf  =  I(1)CLI(2)CL. The rank of the full Yukawa matrix is equal to I(1)CLI(1)CL when I(1)CL  <  I(2)CL. Thus, the I(1)CL(I(1)RC  -  I(1)CL) modes appear massless. Off-diagonal entries are suppressed compared with diagonal entries, and not enough to realize experimental values of mixing angles.

Now, let us consider the case with more than one Higgs fields. We consider the model with the intersecting numbers, (I(1)CL,I(1)RC)(I(2)CL,I(2)RC) = (3,1)(1,3). Even if the intersecting numbers for the Higgs fields are (I(1)LR,I(2)LR) = (2,1) or (1,2), the rank of mass matrix is still equal to one. For example, in the former case, the Yukawa couplings for each of Higgs fields Ha (a = 1,2) are a factorizable form like Yija = aiabj, and the mass matrix mij is still a factorizable form,

[formula]

that is, the rank-one matrix. The minimal case increasing the rank of mass matrix is (I(1)LR,I(2)LR) = (2,2), that is, the totally four Higgs fields. Then, the mass matrix becomes rank-two.

To make all of three flavors massive, we have to introduce more Higgs fields. However, recall the rule for D-brane configuration discussed in subsection 4.1 when I(1)LR  =  3 or I(2)LR  =  3. If we have e.g. I(1)LR  =  3 in addition to I(1)CL  =  3, such D-brane configuration requires at least I(1)RC = 3, and the minimum case with I(1)RC = 3 corresponds to the symmetric flavor structure, which have been discussed in the previous subsection.

Comments on reducing flavor and Higgs numbers

We have studied the flavor structures, which can be derived from intersecting D-brane configurations, including the symmetric flavor structures and asymmetric ones. For the symmetric flavor structure with Nf = 3, corresponding D-brane configurations require the number of Higgs fields to be equal to Nfk with integer k. For the asymmetric flavor case, the D-brane configurations with (I(1)CL,I(1)RC)(I(2)CL,I(2)RC) = (3,1)(1,3) lead to the factorizable form of Yukawa matrix, Yij  =  aibj, that is, the rank-one matrix. That implies that even if we can realize the massless spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we would have difficulty to derive realistic Yukawa matrices from stringy 3-point couplings at the tree-level.

For the symmetric flavor case as well as the asymmetric case, introduction of many Higgs fields may lead to realistic Yukawa matrices. However, in such case, proper values of ratios among VEVs of many Higgs fields have to be chosen. Also, introduction of many Higgs fields may lead to a problem, because that, in general, causes flavor changing neutral currents. One solution is that we introduce extra fields H', which have mass terms with Higgs fields larger than the weak scale, and that only one mode remains light. If such light mode is a linear combination of original modes with proper coefficients, then realistic Yukawa matrices can be realized.

For the asymmetric flavor case, off-diagonal couplings are allowed for one Higgs field, e.g. (I(1)CL,I(1)RC)(I(2)CL,I(2)RC) = (3,2)(2,3), and the cases with more intersecting points also lead to non-trivial mixing angles. However, in such case the flavor number is larger than three. We have to reduce the flavor number, that is, we have to introduce anti-generations and mass terms between generations and anti-generations.

Thus, it is quite important to generate mass terms among Higgs fields H and extra fields H', and/or generations and anti-generations of quarks. One of stringy ways to generate mass terms is recombination of D-branes. However, if those D-branes are stabilized to be bending, it is not clear how to treat them. Otherwise, if those are stabilized not to bend, but be straightened, the resultant D-brane configurations would be classified into the D-brane configurations, which have been studied in subsections 4.1 and 4.2. Anyway, stringy way to generate mass terms is beyond our scope. Thus, here we give comments on this issue from the viewpoint of effective field theory. Within the framework of effective field theory, there may be two ways to generate mass terms; one is through symmetry breaking and the other is due to compositeness through strong dynamics.

Concerned about the former scenario, suppose that we have the following type of couplings,

[formula]

These couplings are originated from the D-brane configuration of Fig. 5 for the Higg fields, and a similar configuration for the quarks. These coupling strengths y are calculated within the framework of string theory. Suppose that the fields X develop their VEVs. Then, the above operators become effective mass terms between H and H', and Q and Q', and that can reduce the number of light flavors and light Higgs fields. Note that the VEVs of the fields X break gauge symmetries, under which X have non-trivial representations. Thus, the gauge group, which is obtained at the string scale, must be larger than one of the standard model.

The latter scenario to generate mass terms is similar to the former. Suppose again that we have the same type of couplings as eq.([\ref=extra]). This time, we assume that the gauge coupling corresponding to the gauge group, under which both X and H', and X and Q', have non-trivial charges becomes strong. Such gauge sector corresponds to the Ds brane in Fig. 5. Then, composite modes appear (H'X) and (Q'X). Obviously, these composite modes have effective mass terms with H and Q. Then, the numbers of Higgs fields and flavors can be reduced.

In the composite scenario, the light modes can be composite modes, when the flavor number from composite modes is larger than one of original modes. In this case, effective Yukawa couplings can be originated from stringy n-point couplings for n = 3,4,5,6 depending on which modes correspond to composite modes. Actually, such explicit models with composite modes have been studied showing an interesting form of Yukawa matrices [\cite=Kitazawa:2004hz] [\cite=Kitazawa:2004nf]. It is quite important to study somehow systematically the flavor structure, which can be derived from intersecting D-brane configurations, considering the above scenarios to reduce the Higgs and flavor numbers through the symmetry breaking and strong dynamics. We have to classify higher dimensional operators as well as 3-point couplings. For such purpose, the discussions in the previous subsections would be useful. However, we leave it for future study.

Conclusion

We have studied the flavor structure and the coupling selection rule within the framework of intersecting D-brane models. We have formulated the coupling selection rule in terms of shift vectors, which are coset representatives corresponding to Λ  /  Λab. With this formulation, we can write the coupling selection rule for generic n-point couplings in a simple way.

We have found that generic D-brane configurations must satisfy the relation ([\ref=generic-conf]). In such generic case, the coupling selection rule is determined by the discrete abelian symmetry. For example, the symmetric flavor structure with Nf = 3 requires at least three Higgs fields, and the coupling selection rule is determined by the Z3 symmetry. We may need more Higgs fields to derive realistic Yukawa matrices.

In the asymmetric flavor structure, the case with Nf = 3 leads to the result that only the third family becomes massive, but the others remain massless. For the asymmetric flavor structure with more flavor, we have non-trivial Yukawa matrices, although their diagonal entries are quite larger than off-diagonal entries and some modes remain still massless.

Our results show that even if we could obtain the minimal matter content of the supersymmetric standard model at the string scale, we would face with the difficultly to derive realistic Yukawa matrices. It would be interesting to study alternative scenario that we may have several Higgs fields and generations and anti-generations of fermions and investigate a way to generate mass terms e.g. within the effective field-theoretical way.

We have studied only 3-point couplings at the tree level. It is important to study higher dimensional operators and loop-effects. In particular, it is interesting to classify D-brane configurations with allowed n-point couplings for [formula] from the viewpoint of the scenarios discussed in subsection 4.3.

In heterotic orbifold models without Wilson lines, massless spectra are degenerate on all of fixed points, and a large number of quarks and leptons as well as Higgs fields appear. However, Wilson lines can resolve such degeneracy [\cite=Ibanez:1986tp] [\cite=Kobayashi:1990mi] [\cite=Kobayashi:1991rp], and lead to different massless spectra between fixed points. That is useful to reduce flavor numbers. We might need such stringy way in intersecting D-brane models.

Shift vectors

In this appendix, we give a simple recipe how to obtain shift vectors [formula] for generic winding numbers, e.g. for the first T2. Here we omit the index (1) for the first T2. We consider the two sets of D-branes with the following winding numbers,

[formula]

Case I

First we consider the case with g.c.d.(na,nb) = 1. In this case, we can show easily g.c.d.(Iab,na) = g.c.d.(Iab,nb) = 1. Thus, the set of independent intersecting points [formula] [formula] is equivalent to the sets of [formula] [formula]. Similarly the set of independent intersecting points [formula] [formula] is equivalent to the sets of [formula] [formula]. Obviously, we have

[formula]

Thus, the sublattice Λab is spanned by (1,Jab) and (0,Iab), where Jab must be integer. This integer, Jab, is irrelevant to description of the sets of independent shifts and coset representatives of Λ  /  Λab. When g.c.d.(ma,mb)  =  Cm  ≠  1, the integer Jab is also written as Jab  =  J'abCm with integer J'ab. The shift vectors describing Iab independent intersecting points are written as

[formula]

Similarly, we can obtain the shift vectors [formula] in the case with g.c.d.(ma,mb) = 1. In this case, the independent shifts are written as

[formula]

When g.c.d.(na,nb) = g.c.d.(ma,mb) = 1, both sets of independent shift vectors are equivalent.

Case II

Here we discuss a simple recipe how to obtain shift vectors in the case with g.c.d.(na,nb) = Cn  ≠  1 and g.c.d.(ma,mb) = Cm  ≠  1, where Cn and Cm must satisfy g.c.d.(Cn,Cm) = 1. We write these winding numbers as follows,

[formula]

where [formula]. We can do the same discussion as the appendix A.1 except replacing

[formula]

For example, we obtain

[formula]

where I'ab  =  n'am'b  -  n'bm'a. Then, the sublattice Λab is spanned by (Cn,CmJ'ab) and (0,CmI'ab), where J'ab must be integer. This integer, J'ab, is irrelevant to coset representatives of Λ  /  Λab like Appendix A.1. The set of independent shifts are obtained as

[formula]

where [formula]. There are other equivalent descriptions of shift vectors.

Symmetric flavor structure with Nf = 2

In subsection 4.1, we have shown that if |ICL| = |ICR| = Nf on T2, the intersecting number |ILR| must satisfy |ILR|  =  kNf with [formula], that is, the minimum number of |ILR| is equal to Nf. Here, again we omit the index for the i-th torus like subsection 4.1. However, this statement is not true for Nf = 2. Indeed, the case with Nf  =  2 requires k  ≥  2. If the following relation

[formula]

is true, we could write

[formula]

where the signs depend on signs of ICL,ICR and ILR. However, the relations ([\ref=int-no-2]) and ([\ref=int-no-2-2]) are inconsistent in the D-brane configurations. The relation ([\ref=int-no-2-2]) always leads to [formula] (even,even) except the two cases with

[formula]

However, both of these cases lead to ILR  =   odd. Thus, one can not realize the D-brane configuration with the relation ([\ref=int-no-2]).

The flavor structure with Nf = 2 on T2 is not realistic, but that can be useful as a piece of a full flavor structure, when we combine it with other flavor structures on T2  ×  T2. (See section 4.)
