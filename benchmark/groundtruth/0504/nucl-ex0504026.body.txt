Three-centre cluster structure in 11C and 11B

Many light nuclei possess well developed cluster structure made of α-particles as main building block. The best known examples are 2α and 3α cluster structures of 8Be and 12C. In recent years attention has been focused on neutron-rich Be and C nuclei, where evidence for developed cluster structures was found (for example [\cite=mi] [\cite=freerpr] [\cite=mil02] [\cite=so13c14c] and references therein). It is interesting to investigate influence of α-clustering on structure of the neutron deficient 11C nucleus and its mirror nucleus 11B for which the experimental evidence for cluster structures is scarce. Here we present results of the experimental studies which probe cluster structure of 11C and 11B via the α-decay of their excited states and for 11B also via 2α+t decay.

The measurements were performed at the Australian National University's 14UD tandem accelerator facility. 70 MeV and 55 MeV 9Be beam were incident on a thin Li2O3 foil. Reaction products were detected in an array of four charged-particle telescopes which provided charge and mass resolution up to Be. Telescopes 1 and 2 were located with their centres at ~  17.5[formula] from the beam axis and telescopes 3 and 4 at ~  29[formula]. The measurement of the energies and angles of detected particles permitted the kinematics of the many-body reactions to be fully reconstructed. Further experimental details can be found in [\cite=so13c14c] [\cite=so11c11b].

The α-decay of excited states in 11B has been studied using the 7Li(9Be,11B* →   α+7Li)5He reaction (Q=-2.4 MeV). The 11B excitation energy spectra show resonances at 9.2, 10.3, 10.55, 11.2, (11.4), 11.8, 12.5, (13.0), 13.1, (14.0), 14.35, (17.4) and (18.6) MeV. A study of the α-decay of 11C excited states has been performed using the 16O(9Be,11C* →   α+7Be)14C reaction (Q=-14.602 MeV). The 11C excitation energy spectra provide evidence for peaks at 8.65, 9.85, 10.7 and 12.1 MeV and indications for peaks at 12.6 and 13.4 MeV. Detailed description and discussion of the results are presented in [\cite=so11c11b]. Analysis of these data shows that main reaction mechanism for the population of the α-decaying states in both nuclei was two-nucleon transfer onto the cluster nucleus 9Be. Figure [\ref=11c11b] presents comparison of the 11B and 11C excitation energy spectra from these measurements. We observe the same series of excited states at the lower excitations in both nuclei: unresolved doublet of 7/2+, 5/2+ states (marked 'a'), a 3/2-, 5/2-, 7/2+ triplet ('b') which is ~  1.2 MeV above the doublet, 9/2+ state ('c') at an excitation of 2 MeV higher than the doublet, then the state which is believed to be the isobaric analogue state of the 11Be ground state ('d') which is ~  3.4 MeV above the doublet, and then weak states, which are probably 7/2+ ('e') and 11/2+ ('f'), and which are 3.9 and 4.8 MeV above the doublet's excitation. An interesting feature of these results is the observation of the α-decay, which means isospin T=1/2, of the excited states proposed to be the isobaric analogue states of the 11Be states, which have T=3/2, in both nuclei. If the observed states are indeed those identified with T=3/2 character, then our results show that the lowest three T=3/2 levels in 11B and the first T=3/2 level in 11C probably have large isospin mixing. Alternatively, the peaks may have a genuine T=1/2 character and may be linked to rotational bands. The present results show that six observed states in 11B and six in 11C can be grouped in two rotational bands [\cite=so11c11b]. Rotational bands with K=5/2+ have been proposed beginning at 7.286 and 6.905 MeV in 11B and 11C respectively, with rotational members at 9.185 and 8.655 (7/2+), 11.265 and 10.679 (9/2+) and 14.04 and 13.4 MeV (11/2+). The moment of inertia I of these bands is very large, with a rotational parameter 2/2I of 0.25 MeV which would correspond to very deformed structure. Other possible positive-parity bands in both 11B and 11C have been proposed with K=3/2+, beginning at excitation energies 7.97784 and 7.4997 MeV, respectively. Rotational members are at 9.274 and 8.699 MeV (5/2+) and 10.597 and 10.083 MeV (7/2+) and the 9/2+ members of these bands would be at 12.6 MeV in 11B and 12.1 MeV in 11C, very close to the excitations of the proposed 1/2+ T=3/2 states and exactly at excitations where resonances are in the present spectra. The rotational parameter 2/2I of these two bands would be 0.215 MeV.

Triple coincidence data provide clear evidence for the 7Li(9Be,ααt)5He reaction (Q=-4.9 MeV) at both Ebeam=70 and 55 MeV [\cite=soaat]. Reconstructed relative energy spectra for all possible combinations of 2 and 3 particles in the exit channel provide evidence for decays of 11B excited states into 2α+t, the 8Be ground state and the first excited state into 2α and for α+t decay of 7Li states at 4.652 and 6.6 MeV. The 11B excitation energy spectra reconstructed from the energies and momenta of all three detected decay products presented in Figure [\ref=aat] show peaks at 13.1, 14.4 and 17.5 MeV. All three states are also observed in the α+7Li data. An analysis gives evidence for the t+8Be(gs) decay of the 11B states at 13.1 and 14.4 MeV and decays via 8Be(3.03 MeV) and 7Li(4.652 MeV) states of the 14.4 and 17.5 MeV states [\cite=soaat]. These results are the first direct evidence for decay of 11B excited states into these three-body channels.

Given the nature of the reaction processes, two-nucleon transfer onto the 2α+n nucleus 9Be, the observed strong α-decay of these mirror states at excitations where various decay channels are open and known α+t(3He) structure of 7Li(7Be), as well as observed decays of 11B states into 2α+t, it is possible that these states possess the three-centre 2α+t(3He) cluster structure. These two nuclei may be an example of the three-centre structure in which holes, rather than nucleons, are being exchanged between α-cores. The present measurements did not provide information on the spin and parity of the observed states, which are unknown for some of the states, and also on partial widths, which are crucial for the understanding of their structure. Additional measurements capable of determining this information will be performed in the near future.
