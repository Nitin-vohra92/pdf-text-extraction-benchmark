Quasi-crystal structures of Bose-Einstein condensates

We discuss quasi-crystals structures of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) which correspond to a Penrose tiling of the plane. The underlying model is the repulsive 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation

[formula]

with the following optical lattice

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and ε denotes the strength of the lattice. For n = 3,4, this potential originates a Bravais lattice with three-fold and four-fold symmetry, respectively. For n = 5 it produces a lattice with an impossible five-fold quasi symmetry which correspond to the Penrose tiling of the plane [\cite=penrose]. To show this, we first study the interference patterns which are created when an initial gaussian distribution of matter

[formula]

is released in such quasi-periodic potential. To allow the matter to expand in the structure, we consider the case of small potential amplitude and relatively small number of atoms. The result are shown in the following figures. In Fig.1 the interference pattern created after a time t = 0.5 is depicted. In Fig. 2 we show the same pattern of Fig. 1 with lines joining the points where the peak intensity is higher superimposed. The formation of the Penrose tiling of the plane becomes then evident, this providing an example of BEC quasi-crystal [\cite=santos]. Taking n > 6 in Eq. ([\ref=OL]) one can generate other types of planar quasi-crystals (i.e. with heptagonal (n=7), octagonal (n=8), etc., quasi-symmetries).

Next we investigate the possibility to form localized states of soliton type in 2D quasi-crystals. As a result we show that soliton states can indeed be formed. Although this is expected, due to the the trapping features of the potential (especially for high values of ε), a main difference with gap-solitons of periodic lattices is that in quasi-crystals the shape and properties of the soliton strongly depends on the position in the lattice. Due to the lacking of a strict periodicity in the system one may expect the existence of a large variety of localized excitations in BEC quasi-crystals.
