Mirror World and Axion: Relaxing Cosmological Bounds

MIRROR WORLD AND AXION: RELAXING COSMOLOGICAL BOUNDS

The CP violating term LΘ  =  Θ(αs / 8π)Gμνμν, in the QCD Lagrangian, leads to observable effects (e.g. non zero neutron electric dipole moment), experimentally not observed. This fact is referred to as the strong CP problem (for a general reference see Ref. ).

In the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism,[\cite=PQ] which is the most appealing solution of this problem, the parameter Θ becomes a dynamical field, the axion a = (fPQ / N)Θ, whose potential is minimized for the CP even configuration 〈a〉 = 0. The axion emerges as the pseudo-Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken global axial symmetry U(1)PQ. Here fPQ is a constant, with dimension of energy, called the PQ constant, and N stands for the color anomaly of U(1)PQ current.[\cite=kim] In the following, we will usually refer to the constant fa = fPQ / N, which characterizes the axion phenomenology. Astrophysical considerations exclude all the value of fa up to 1010 GeV.[\cite=kim] [\cite=raffelt] On the other hand, the cosmological limit, related to the primordial oscillations of the axion field, demands the upper bound fa < 1012 GeV.[\cite=kim] [\cite=raffelt] Let us briefly review the origin of this last limit.

In most axion models, the PQ symmetry breaking occurs when a complex scalar field, φ, which carries PQ charge, acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) 〈φ〉  ~  fPQ. This occurs as the temperature of the universe cools down below the value of the PQ temperature. As said, the axion is identified with the angular degree of freedom a = faΘ. Today Θ is settled in the CP-conserving minimum Θ = 0. However, after the PQ symmetry breaking, as the temperature is of the order of the PQ scale, the axion is massless and the initial value of the phase Θ is chosen stochastically. We indicate this initial value with Θi.

When the universe is cold enough for the QCD phase transition, instanton effects curve the potential so that the axion acquires a non zero mass ma(T) = mQ(T), where m is the zero temperature limit:[\cite=kolb]

[formula]

The function Q(T) for temperature T  ≫  Λ (Λ  ~  200 MeV is the QCD scale) was calculated in Ref.  and can be approximated as:[\cite=Turner]

[formula]

where A = 0.1  ×  10±  0.5 and b = 3.7  ±  0.1. This power law is valid when T > Λ while for T  ≪  Λ we have Q = 1 and the mass becomes independent of the temperature. We use this relation until Q(T) < 1, that is until T  >  Tc  =  A1 / bΛ≃100 MeV, and assume that Q(T) = 1 for T < Tc.

Then Θ starts to roll down, slowed by the Hubble expansion, following the equation:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Hubble expansion rate. When the curvature term dominates on the (Hubble) friction term, Θ begins to oscillate with the frequency ma(T). This happens at the temperature value T = Ti defined by the equation [formula], where MPl = 1.22  ×  1019 GeV is the Plank mass and [formula] is the effective number of the particle degrees of freedom at T = Ti.

For temperatures T  <  Ti, when the coherent oscillations commence, eq. ([\ref=Theta]) can be considerably simplified, and leads to the quite simple result naR3  =   const, where na(T)  =  ρa(T) / ma(T) is the axion number density. In other words, the number of axions in a comoving volume remains in fact constant during the universe expansion. We further assume that no entropy production takes place after the moment when the axion field begins to oscillate. Then the axion number density to the entropy density ratio, ηa = na(T) / s(T), remains constant at T < Ti, and thus the present energy density of axions is ρ0a  =  ηas0m, where s0 = (2π2 / 45)gs0T30 is the present entropy density, gs0 = 3.91 and T0 = 2.725 K is the CMB temperature. At the initial moment ti, the axion number density is [formula]. Comparing to the critical density ρcr  =  8.1h2  ·  10- 47 GeV4, we obtain:

[formula]

where Ti1  =  (Ti / 1  GeV) and f12 = fa / 1012 GeV.

Substituting ([\ref=f]) in the expression [formula], which defines the temperature Ti, we obtain:

[formula]

where Λ200  =  (Λ / 200  MeV) and the uncertainties of about 20 percent are related to uncertainties in parameters A and b. This estimation very weakly depends on f12 and thus for the Peccei-Quinn scales of the cosmological relevance, starting from the astrophysical bound fa  ≥  1010 GeV to fa order GUT scale 1015 - 16 GeV, Ti changes within interval 2 GeV - 200 MeV and hence [formula]. This estimation is valid, however, until Ti  >  Tc  =  A1 / bΛ≃100 MeV.

Therefore, we obtain:

[formula]

Demanding Ωah2 < 0.15, the natural choice Θi  ~  1, leads to [formula].

It is worth underlining that the only upper limit on the PQ scale comes from cosmology. This limit is a few order of magnitude less than the typical GUT scale. Thus, due to cosmological considerations, it seems quite improbable to insert the axion in any GUT model. The obvious question is then: how universal is relation ([\ref=Omegah2-st])? We will show that for a mirror axion model this can change and, consequently, the cosmological bound can be relaxed.

The idea of mirror world was introduced many years ago and has been successfully applied in different sectors of astrophysics and cosmology.[\cite=mirror] The mirror world consists of another, parallel, sector of "mirror" particles and interactions with the Lagrangian completely similar to that of the ordinary particles. In other words, it has the same gauge group and coupling constants as the ordinary world, so that the Lagrangian of the whole theory is invariant with respect to the Mirror parity (M-parity) which interchanges the two sectors.

The possibility to implement the PQ mechanism in the mirror world scenario is discussed in Ref. . The general feature is the following: the total Lagrangian must be of the form [formula], where L represents the ordinary Lagrangian, [formula] the mirror one and Lint is an interaction term. For λ = 0, the total Lagrangian contains two identical U(1)axial symmetries, while the Lint term breaks these in just the usual U(1)PQ. Thus only one axion field results, which is defined in both sectors.

As long as the M-parity is an exact symmetry, the particle physics is exactly the same in the two worlds, and so the strong CP problem is simultaneously solved in both sectors. In particular, the axion couples to both sectors in the same way and their non-perturbative QCD dynamics produce the same contribution to the axion effective potential. This situation does not bring drastic changes of the axion properties; just the axion zero temperature mass is increased by a factor of [formula] with respect to the standard expression ([\ref=a-m]). On the other hand, on a cosmological ground, the physics is less trivial. Cosmologically the mirror sector cannot be identical to ours. If so, the energy density due to the extra (mirror) degrees of freedom would be much bigger than what is allowed in the standard cosmology scenario. The mirror sector must then be colder than ours by a factor [formula]. As a consequence, the energy density of the whole universe is essentially the ordinary one, and the Hubble expansion is completely driven by our sector: H(T)  ~  1.66g1 / 2*T2 / MPl, where g* counts only the ordinary degrees of freedom.

Let us consider, now, the primordial oscillations of the axion field for a generic mirror axion model. For this case, we have [formula] in the zero temperature limit. However, at finite temperatures the behavior of the axion mass is dominated by the contribution from the mirror sector, which has a lower temperature than the ordinary one, T'  ≪  T, and thus we have ma(T)  ≈  mA(Λ / xT)b. Therefore, the axion mass grows faster with the temperature, and the temperature Ti at which the axion field starts to oscillate scales as x- 0.65. Correspondingly, the axion mass density Ωah2 roughly scales as [formula]. E.g. for x = 0.1, we obtain Ωah2 about 3 times smaller than in the estimate ([\ref=Omegah2-st]).

However, this situation is valid until the condition Ti(x)  >  Tc(x), where Tc(x) is defined as the temperature at which ma(T) = m. This condition roughly translates in x  >  0.01f1 / 212. In this case we obtain:

[formula]

and hence:

[formula]

which, for Θi  ~  1, leads to the upper limit f12 < 15.

In conclusion, we have considered here a very simple model for mirror axion. In fact, in this, the axion properties are essentially the same as for the standard invisible axion, and only the mass is increased by a factor [formula]. On the other hand, we have shown that its cosmology is non trivial, because of the different temperature of the mirror sector. This leads to a weaker cosmological bound on the PQ scale. In particular it can be closer to the GUT scale.
