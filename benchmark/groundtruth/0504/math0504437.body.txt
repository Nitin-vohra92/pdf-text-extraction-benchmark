In this paper the homology theory of fibre spaces is studied by introducing additional algebraic structure in homology and cohomology.

All modules are assumed to be over an arbitrary associative ring Λ with unit; by a differential algebra, coalgebra, module, or comodule we mean these objects graded by non-negative integers; â denotes ( - 1)deg a.

The category A(  ∞  ). An A(  ∞  )-algebra in the sense of Stasheff [\cite=Sta] is defined to be a graded Λ-module M, endowed with a set of operations [formula] satisfying the conditions [formula] and

[formula]

for any ai∈M and i  ≥  1. A morphism of A(  ∞  )-algebras (M,{mi})  →  (M',{m'i}) is a set of homomorphisms [formula] satisfying the conditions [formula] and

[formula]

where [formula]. The A(  ∞  )-algebras together with these morphisms form a category, which we denote by A(  ∞  ).

The specification on M of an A(  ∞  )-algebra structure (M,{mi}) is equivalent to the specification on the tensor coalgebra [formula] with the grading [formula] and comultiplication

[formula]

of a differential dm:Tc(M)  →  Tc(M) that turns Tc(M) into a differential coalgebra; this set {mi} determines the differential dm by

[formula]

and the differential coalgebra (Tc(M),dm) is called the [formula]-construction of the A(  ∞  )-algera (M,{mi}) (Stasheff [\cite=Sta]) and is denoted by (M,{mi}). The specification of an A(  ∞  )-algebra morphism {fi}:(M,{mi})  →  (M',{m'i}) is equivalent to that of a differential coalgebra mapping f:(M,{mi})  →  (M',{m'i}); the morphism {fi} determines the mapping f by

[formula]

Thus the category A(  ∞  ) can be identified with a full subcategory of the category of differential coalgebras.

An arbitrary object in A(  ∞  ) of the form (M,{m1,m2,0,0,...}) is identified with the differential algebra (M,∂,  ·  ) where ∂ = m1 and [formula]. For such an object the [formula]-construction coincides with the usual B-construction, any morphism of such objects of the form {f1,0,0,...} is identified with the differential algebra mapping f1:(M,∂,  ·  )  →  (M�,∂�,  ·  ). Thus the category of differential algebras is a subcategory of A(  ∞  ), while the category DASH (see [\cite=Munk]) is the full subcategory of A(  ∞  ) generated by differential algebras, and the functor [formula] is an extension of B from this subcategory to A(  ∞  ).

For any differential algebra C with free Hi(C),i  ≥  0 it is possible to introduce on H(C) an A(  ∞  )-algebra structure

[formula]

such that [formula] and there exists an A(  ∞  )-morphism

[formula]

for which f1:H(C)  →  C induces an identical isomorphis in homology.

Proof. We need to construct two sets of homomorphisms

[formula]

satisfying the conditions in the definition of the category A(  ∞  ):

[formula]

[formula]

for arbitrary ak∈H(C) and i  ≥  1. Fir i = 1 we take X1 = 0, and, using the fact that Hi(C) is free, we define f1:H(C)  →  C to be a cycle-choosing homomorphis; the conditions ([\ref=X]) and ([\ref=f]), as well as the initial condition on f1 are thereby satisfied. Suppose now that Xi and fi have been constructed for i < n in such a way that the conditions ([\ref=X]) and ([\ref=f]) hold. Let

[formula]

(here the Xi and fi already defined are involved). Then the condition ([\ref=f]) takes the form

[formula]

Direct calculations show that ∂Un = 0, that is, [formula] is a cycle in C for arbitrary ai∈H(C), and we define [formula] to be the class of this cycle, that is, Xn  =  {Un}. Since f1 is a cycle-choosing homomorphism, the difference f1Xn - Un is homological to zero. Assuming that ai∈H(C) are free generators we define [formula] as an element of C boundaring this difference and extend by linearity. For the Xn and fn thus defined the condition ([\ref=U]) is automatically satisfied. The remanning condition ([\ref=X]) can be proved by a straightforward check.

We remark that the theorem is true also when an arbitrary A(  ∞  )-algebra is taken instead of C, and H(M) is understood to be the homology of M with respect to the differential m1.

The A(  ∞  )-algebra (H(C),{Xi}) we call the homology A(  ∞  )-algebra of the differential algebra C. As is clear from the proof, this structure is not uniquely determined on H(C) (there is an arbitrariness in the choice of the fi). We show later that the structure of the homology A(  ∞  )-algebra on H(C) is unique up to isomorphism in A(  ∞  ).

We mention that if a1  ·  a2 = a2  ·  a3 = 0 for a1,a2,a3∈H(C), then [formula] is an element of the Massey product < a1,a2,a3  >  , and this fact provides us with examples in which the operation X3 is non-trivial. The next result follows from the Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

The mapping of differential coalgebras

[formula]

induces an isomorphism in homology.

The category M(  ∞  ). An A(  ∞  )-module over an A(  ∞  )-algebra (M,{mi}) we define to be a graded Λ-module P, endowed with a set of operations [formula] satisfying the conditions [formula] and

[formula]

The specification on P of an A(  ∞  )-module structure over (M,{mi}) is equivalent to the specification on [formula] of a differential that turns it into a differential comodule over (M,{mi}). The objects of the category M(  ∞  ) are defined to be the pairs ((M,{mi}),(P,{pi})), where (M,{mi}) is an A(  ∞  )-algebra, and (P,{pi}) is an A(  ∞  )-module over it. A morphism is defined to be a pair of sets of homomorphisms {fi},{gi} where {fi}:(M,{mi})  →  (M',{m'i}) is a morphism of A(  ∞  )-algebras and

[formula]

is a set satisfying the conditions [formula] and

[formula]

These conditions ensure that the mapping

[formula]

given by

[formula]

is a differential comodule mapping compatible with f. With the obvious morphisms the category of pairs (C,D), where C is a differential algebra and D is a differential module over it, forms a subcategory of M(  ∞  ).

If C is a differential algebra and D is a differential module over it such that Hi(C) and Hi(D) are free, then on H(D) it is possible to introduce the structure of an A(  ∞  )-module [formula] over the homology A(  ∞  )-algebra (H(C),{Xi}) such that [formula] and there exists a morphism ({fi},{gi}):((H(C),{Xi}),(H(D),{Yi}))  →  (C,D) of M(  ∞  ) for which f1:H(C)  →  C and g1:H(D)  →  D induce identical isomorphisms in homology.

Proof. The sets {gi} and {Yi} are constructed by induction on i just as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm1]. Using the fact that Hi(D) is free, we define g1 to be a cycle-choosing homomorphism, while Y1 = 0, and the conditions of the category M(  ∞  ) are satisfied for i = 1. Let

[formula]

then ∂Vn = 0, therefore, we define Yn  =  {Vn}. Since g1 is a cycle-choosing homomorphism, g1Yn - Vn is a cycle in D homologous to zero. Using the fact that Hi(D) is free, we define [formula] to be a homomorphism for which ∂gn  =  g1Vn - Vn. The conditions of the category M(  ∞  ) are satisfied for the Yn and gn thus defined.

Twisted tensor products. The twisted tensor products of Brown [\cite=Brown] can be generalized from the case of differential algebras and modules to the case of A(  ∞  )-algebras and A(  ∞  )-modules: for an arbitrary differential coalgebra (K,d) and an A(  ∞  )-algebra (M,{mi}) a ~  -twisting cochain we define to be a homomorphism φ:K  →  M of degree - 1 that satisfies the condition

[formula]

where [formula] is the homomorphism defined by [formula]. The specification of a ~  -twisting cochain φ:K  →  M is equivalent to that of a mapping of differential coalgebra fφ:(K,d)  →  (M,{mi}). For any (K,d) and ((M,{mi}),(P,{pi}))∈M(  ∞  ) any ~  -twisting cochain φ:K  →  M on the tensor product [formula] determines by

[formula]

a differential, turning [formula] into a differential comodule over (K,d); this differential comodule is called the ~  -twisted tensor product [formula]. If M is an A(  ∞  )-algebra of the form (M,{m1,m2,0,0,...}), and P is an A(  ∞  )-module of the form (P,{p1,p2,0,0,...}), then φ is the usual twisting cochain, and [formula] coincides with the usual twisted tensor product [formula].

We need the concept of equivalence of twisting cochains (see [\cite=Berik1], [\cite=Berik2], [\cite=Smir]). We say that φ,ψ:K  →  C are equivalent if there is a homomorphism c:K  →  C of degree 0 for which c0 = c|C0 = 0 and [formula] where

[formula]

φ  ~  ψ if and only if fφ,fψ:K  →  B� are homotopic in the sense of [\cite=Munk] (coderivation homotopy): fφ - fψ  =  ∂D + D∂ with [formula].

If (K,d) is a differential coalgebra with free Ki, and φ:K  →  C is an arbitrary twisting cochain, then there exists a ~  -twisting cochain φ*:K  →  H(C) such that φ and [formula] are equivalent.

Proof. To construct [formula] we prove the following inductive assertion: for any i > 0 there exists a twisting cochain φ(i):K  →  C and a homomorphisms φ*i:Ki  →  Hi - 1(C) and ci:Ki  →  Ci such that

[formula]

For i = 1 we take φ*1  =  {φ1}. Since the difference (φ1 - f1φ*1)(k) is homologous to zero for each k∈K1 and K1 is free, we obtain a homomorphism c1:K1  →  C1 for which -  ∂c1  =  φ1 - f1φ*1. We define [formula], so φ(1)1  =  φ1  +  ∂c1 = f1φ*1. Suppose now that φ(i), φ*i, and ci have already been constructed in such a way that (a), (b), and (c) hold for i < n. Let

[formula]

A direct check shows that ∂Wn = 0; we define φ*n  =  {Wn}. Since the difference Wn - f1φ*n is homological to zero and Kn is free, we can construct a cn:Kn  →  Cn such that -  ∂cn  =  Wn - f1φ*n; let [formula]. Then

[formula]

consequently, (b) and (c) hold for φ(n),φ*n, and cn, and the validity of (a) can be checked directly. From (a) we see that [formula] is a ~  -twisting cochain, and from (b) and (c) we deduce that f*φ*  =  φ∞, where [formula].

It follows from Theorem [\ref=Thm3] that for any differential coalgebra mapping g:K  →  B� there exists a G*:K  →  (H(C),{Xi}) for which g and fg* are homotopic in the sense of [\cite=Munk]. This assertion implies uniqueness mentioned above for the structure of homology A(  ∞  )-algebra: if (H(C),{Xi}) and (H(C),{X�i}) are two structures of homology A(  ∞  )-algebra on H(C), then by taking K = (H(C),{X�i}) and g = f�:(H(C),{X�i})  →  B(C), we obtain a

[formula]

for which fg*  ~  g. Then the first component of the A(  ∞  )algebra morphism {g*i}:(H(C),{X�i})  →  (H(C),{Xi}) induced by g* is g*1 = idH(C), and this implies that {g*i} is an isomorphism in A(  ∞  ).

The next result follows from Theorems [\ref=Thm1], [\ref=Thm2] and [\ref=Thm3].

[formula] and [formula] have isomorphic homology under the conditions of Theorems [\ref=Thm1], [\ref=Thm2] and [\ref=Thm3].

The results obtained have the following applications.

The first proposition is obtained from Corollary [\ref=Cor1] by taking C = *(G), where G is a connected topological group such that the Hi(G) are free, bearing in mind that H(B(C)) = H*(BG).

The homology of the [formula]-construction (*(G),{Xi}) are isomorphic to that of classifying space BG.

The next proposition is obtained from Corollary [\ref=Cor1] by taking C = C*(B,b0), where B is a simply connected space with free groups Hi(B,b0), and bearing in mind that H(B(C)) = H*(ΩC).

The homology of the [formula]-construction (*(B,b0),{Xi}) are isomorphic to the cohomology of the loop space ΩB.

Let ξ = (X,p,B,G) be a principal G-fibration with paracompact base and connected G, let F be a G-space, and ξ[F] = (E,p,B,F,G) the associated fiber bundle, with the Hi(G) and H(i(F) free. The final proposition is obtained from Corollary [\ref=Cor2] ty taking C = C*(G), D = C*(F), and φ a twisting cochain of the fibration ξ ([\cite=Brown]).

The homology of the ~  -twisted tensor product [formula] is isomorphic to that of E.

This proposition generalize a result of Shih [\cite=Shih]: if G is (n - 1)-connected, then the components φ*i∈Ci(B,Hi - 1(G)) vanish for 0 < i < n + 1, therefore, the differentials di of the spectral sequence of ξ[F] are trivial for 1 < i < n + 1, and the components are cocycles for n < i < 2n + 1, consequently, dj can be expressed for n < i < 2n + 1 in terms of certain characteristic classes of ξ and the operation [formula]; we remark that higher operations Yi are needed for computing dj, j > 2n, in terms of φ*.

Theorems [\ref=Thm1], [\ref=Thm2] and Proposition [\ref=Prop3] were announced in [\cite=Kade1] and Proposition [\ref=Prop2] in [\cite=Kade2].
