Quantum entanglement and wedge product

Introduction

Quantum entanglement is one of the most interesting properties of quantum mechanics. It has become an essential resource for the quantum information (including quantum communication and quantum computing) developed in recent years, with some potential applications such as quantum cryptography [\cite=Bennett84] [\cite=Ekert91]and quantum teleportation [\cite=Bennett93]. Quantification of a multipartite state entanglement [\cite=Lewen00] [\cite=Dur99] is quite difficult and is directly linked to linear algebra, geometry, and functional analysis. The definition of separability and entanglement of a multipartite state was introduced in[\cite=Vedral97], following the definition for bipartite states, given by Werner [\cite=Werner89]. One of widely used measure of entanglement of a pair of qubits, is entanglement of formation and the concurrence, that gives an analytic formula for the entanglement of formation [\cite=Bennett96] [\cite=Wootters98] [\cite=Wootters00]. In resent years, there have been some proposals to generalize this measure to general bipartite state [\cite=Uhlmann00] [\cite=Audenaert] [\cite=Rungta01] [\cite=Gerjuoy] and to multipartite state [\cite=Albeverio] [\cite=Bhaktavatsala] [\cite=Akhtarshenas]. In this paper, I will derive a measure of entanglement that coincides with the generalized concurrence for a general pure bi-and three-partite state based on an algebraic and geometric point of view, using wedge product, a useful tool from multi linear algebra, which is mostly used in differential geometry and topology in relation with differential forms. For a multipartite state with more than three subsystems, this idea will not completely quantify the entanglement of such a quantum state, but it does define set of separable state for any general pure multipartite state. To make this note self-contained, I will give a short introduction to multi-linear algebra.

Quantum entanglement

In this section we will define separable state and entangled state as well as give some example of entangled state. Let us denote a general pure composite quantum system [formula] with m subsystems, consisting of a state

[formula]

defined on a Hilbert space

[formula]

where the dimension of jth Hilbert space is given by Nj  =   dim (HQj). We are going to use this notation through this paper, i.e., we denote a pure pair of qubits by Qp2(2,2). Next,let ρQ denote a density operator acting on the HQ. Then ρQ is said to be separable, which we will denote by ρsepQ, with respect to the Hilbert space decomposition, if it can be written as

[formula]

for some positive integer N, where pk are positive real numbers and ρkj denote a density operator on Hilbert space HQj. If ρpQ represents a pure state, then the quantum system is separable if ρpQ can be written as [formula], where ρQj is a density operator on HQj. If a state is not separable, then it is called an entangled state. Some of the most important entangled states are called the Bell states or [formula] states.

Multi linear algebra

In this section we will establish a relation between Wedge product and concurrence of a general multipartite state. Let us consider the complex vector spaces [formula] be vector spaces, where [formula]. Then we define a tensor of type (m,n) on [formula] as follows

[formula]

where [formula] is the space of linear applications [formula] and is called dual of [formula]. For any basis ei of [formula] and ej the dual basis of ei defined by ej(ei) = δji, we have the following linear representation

[formula]

I.e., we have [formula] and [formula]. Let Sm be group of permutations [formula]. Then we call the tensor [formula] symmetric if

[formula]

for all π∈Sm. The space of symmetric tensor is denoted by [formula]. Moreover, we call the tensor [formula] skew-symmetric if

[formula]

for all π∈Sm, where ε(π) is the signature of permutation π. The space of symmetric tensor is denoted by [formula]. Furthermore, we have the following mapping

[formula]

where [formula]. For example for m = 2 we have

[formula]

Measure of entanglement for general bipartite state based on wedge product

From the wedge product, we can define a measure of entanglement for a general pure bipartite quantum system Qp2(N1,N2) as

[formula]

,where [formula], [formula] and [formula] denote the complex conjugate of Cμ,ν. That is, for a quantum system Qp2(N1,N2), if we write the coefficients αi1,i2, for all 1  ≤  i1  ≤  N1 and 1  ≤  i2  ≤  N2 in form of a N1  ×  N2 matrix as below

[formula]

then the vectors vμ and vν refer to different rows of this matrix. As an example let us look at the quantum system Qp2(2,2) representing a pair of qubits. Then an expression for a measure of entanglement for such state using the above equation ([\ref=bicon]) is given by

[formula]

where C1,2 is given by

[formula]

for N = 2. The measure of entanglement for the general bipartite state defined in equation ([\ref=bicon]) coincides with the generalized concurrence defined in [\cite=Uhlmann00] [\cite=Audenaert] [\cite=Rungta01] [\cite=Gerjuoy] and in particular equation ([\ref=pairq]) that gives the concurrence of a pair of qubits, first time defined in [\cite=Wootters98] [\cite=Wootters00].

General multipartite state and wedge product

Unfortunately, I couldn't directly generalize this result, using equation ([\ref=Wedge]), to a general pure multipartite state. I.e., for a general three-partite quantum system Qp2(N1,N2,N3) with the coefficients αi1,i2,i3, for all 1  ≤  i1  ≤  N1, 1  ≤  i2  ≤  N2 and 1  ≤  i3  ≤  N3, we cannot identify the vectors vμ, vν and vτ. But generally, it could be possible for a quantum system with even number subsystems, i.e., [formula]. To be able to define a expression for degree of entanglement of a general pure multipartite state, I will construct a "artificial" wedge product between each subsystem in a composite system as in the case of the bipartite state. So, let us consider the quantum system [formula] and define

[formula]

Then, a wedge product between each pair of subsystem takes the following form

[formula]

Now, we can define a measure of entanglement as follows

[formula]

where [formula] and multi-index [formula]. As an example, let us look at the general pure three-partite quantum system Qp2(N1,N2,N3). The above measure of entanglement gives

[formula]

This measure of entanglement coincides with the generalized concurrence [\cite=Albeverio] and is equivalent, but not equal, to our entanglement tensor based on joint POVMs on phase space [\cite=Hosh2]. For a general multipartite state, that is, for m  ≥  4 this measure [formula] is not invariant under local operations. To show it, let us consider the quantum system Qp4(2,2,2,2). In this case we can have seven types of separability between different subsystems as below: It may be possible to factor Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4 from the composite system. To check this we need to make four different permutation of indices and it is exactly what the measure E(Qp4(2,2,2,2)) does. But there are other types of separability in this four-qubits state, namely if it is possible to factor out Q1Q2, Q1Q3, Q1Q4, Q2Q3, Q2Q4, or Q3Q4. These six possible factorizations can be reduced to three checks of separability since if we test for separability of, i.e., Q1Q2, we have simultaneously tested Q3Q4. For these types of separability we do need to perform more than one simultaneous permutation of indices. We have discussed these separabilities in relation with Segre variety [\cite=Hosh3].

Conclusion

In this paper, I have derived a measure of entanglement that coincides with concurrence of a general pure bipartite state based on mapping of a tensor product space to an alternating tensor product space defined by a wedge product. Moreover, I derived an expression for degree of entanglement for a multipartite state, which again coincides with generalize concurrence for a general pure three-partite state, but this measure fail to quantify entanglement for a composite system with more than three subsystems. However, this expression defines a set of separable states of a general multipartite state.
