Simple fold maps and compact manifolds bounded by their source manifolds

Introduction, terminologies and notation

As a higher dimensional versions of Morse functions, fold maps have been fundamental tools in the studies of smooth manifolds by using generic maps. A fold map is defined as a smooth map such that each singular point is of the form

[formula]

for two positive integers m  ≥  n and an integer 0  ≤  i  ≤  m - n + 1. A Morse function is naturally regarded as a fold map (n = 1). For a fold map from a closed smooth manifold of dimension m into a smooth manifold of dimension n (without boundary), the following two hold (m  ≥  n  ≥  1).

The singular set, defined as the set of all the singular points, is a closed smooth submanifold of dimension n - 1 of the source manifold.

The restriction map to the singular set is a smooth immersion of codimension 1.

Studies of such maps were started by Whitney ([\cite=whitney]) and Thom ([\cite=thom]) in the 1950s. We also note that if the restriction map to the singular set is an immersion with normal crossings, it is stable (stable maps are important in the theory of global singularity; see [\cite=golubitskyguillemin] for example).

Since around the 1990s, fold maps with additional conditions have been actively studied. For example, in [\cite=burletderham], [\cite=furuyaporto], [\cite=saeki2], [\cite=saekisakuma] and [\cite=sakuma], special generic maps, which are defined as smooth maps such that singular points are always of the form

[formula]

for two positive integers m  ≥  n, were studied. Simple fold maps are defined as fold maps such that fibers of singular values do not have any connected component with more than one singular points (see cite [\cite=saeki] and [\cite=sakuma2]) and special generic maps are simple. In [\cite=kobayashisaeki], Kobayashi and Saeki investigated topology of stable maps including fold maps which are stable from closed manifolds of dimensions larger than 2 into the plane. maps including fold maps which are stable from closed manifolds of dimensions larger than 2 into the plane.

Later, in [\cite=saekisuzuoka], Saeki and Suzuoka found good properties of manifolds admitting stable maps such that the inverse images of regular values are disjoint unions of spheres. The main theorem [\cite=saekisuzuoka] states that a closed smooth manifold of dimension 4 admitting such a stable map into a surface without boundary bounds a nice compact smooth manifold of dimension 5 we can construct by observing the inverse images of the maps. As [\cite=kitazawa], the theorem is generalized as a proposition for a simple fold map such that the inverse images of regular values are disjoint unions of spheres from a closed smooth manifold of dimension m into a smooth manifold of dimension n without boundary (see also [\cite=saeki] and its proof). In this paper, we consider extensions of these works. We consider simple fold maps such that the inverse images of regular values are more general and show that under appropriate differential topological conditions, the source manifolds are bounded by compact PL or smooth manifolds.

This paper is organized as follows.

Section [\ref=sec:2] is for preliminaries. We review the Reeb space of a smooth map, which is the space consisting of all the connected components of all the fibers of the map. We review fundamental facts on simple fold maps in Proposition [\ref=prop:1].

In section [\ref=sec:3], as main theorems, under some appropriate situations, we prove facts similar to ones in [\cite=saekisuzuoka] introduced before for closed smooth manifolds admitting simple fold maps such that the inverse images of regular values are not always disjoint unions of spheres by analogy of the proofs of the original statements with extra new technique on algebraic and differential topology. More precisely, we first decompose the Reeb space Wf of the given simple fold map f:M  →  N into some pieces by using its simplicial structure, construct manifolds piece by piece and then we glue them together to obtain the desired manifold W such that ∂W = M. As a result, we also obtain other objects such as a polyhedron simple homotopy equivalent to W, which is not obtained in the proofs of known results.

In this paper, smooth manifolds and smooth maps between them are of class C∞ unless otherwise stated. Throughout this paper, we assume that M is a closed smooth manifold of dimension m (m  ≥  1) and that N is a smooth manifold of dimension n without boundary (m  ≥  n  ≥  1). We set f as a smooth map from M into N and denote the singular set of the map, defined as the set of all the singular points of the map, by S(f).

We also note about homeomorphisms. In this paper, we often consider PL homeomorphisms between two polyhedra including ones between two PL manifolds. In this paper, for two polyhedra X1 and X2, a homeomorphism φ:X1  →  X2 which is isotopic (in the topology category) to a homeomorphism from X1 onto X2 which gives an isomorphism between underlying simplicial complexes is said to be a PL homeomorphism. Note that any diffeomorphism between two diffeomorphic manifolds is regarded as a PL homeomorphism, where we consider the canonical PL structures.

Preliminaries

Reeb spaces

We introduce the Reeb space of a continuous map.

Let X, Y be topological spaces. For p1,p2∈X and for a map c:X  →  Y, we define as p1  ~  cp2 if and only if p1 and p2 are in the same connected component of c- 1(p) for some p∈Y. ~  c is an equivalence relation.

We set the quotient space Wc: = X /   ~  c. we call Wc the Reeb space of c.

We denote the induced quotient map from X into Wc by qc. We define :Wc  →  Y so that [formula]. For example, for a Morse function, the Reeb space is a graph and for a simple fold map, the Reeb space is homeomorphic to a polyhedron which is not so complex (see Proposition [\ref=prop:1] later). For a special generic map, the Reeb space is homeomorphic to a smooth manifold (see section 2 of [\cite=saeki2]).

Here, we introduce terms on spheres, fiber bundles and polyhedra which are important in this paper.

In this paper, an almost-sphere means a smooth homotopy sphere given by glueing same dimensional two standard discs together by a diffeomorphism between the boundaries. We note that the underlying PL manifold of an almost-sphere is a standard sphere.

We often use terminologies on (fiber) bundles in this paper (see also [\cite=steenrod] for example). For a topological space X, an X-bundle is a bundle whose fiber is X. A bundle whose structure group is G is a trivia bundle if it is equivalent to the product bundle as a bundle whose structure group is G. In this paper, a PL (smooth ) bundle means a bundle whose fiber is a polyhedron (resp. smooth manifold) and whose structure group is a group consisting of some PL homeomorphisms (resp. diffeomorphisms) of the fiber. A linear bundle is a bundle whose fiber is a standard sphere or a standard disc and whose structure group consist of linear transformations on the fiber.

In this paper, we also use terminologies on polyhedra. In this paper, for a polyhedron of dimension k  ≥  1, a branched point means a point such that every open neighborhood of the point is not homeomorphic to any open set of [formula] or [formula]. If a polyhedron X of dimension k does not have branched points, then it is a manifold with triangulation and we can define the interior IntX and the boundary ∂X.

The following proposition is well-known and we omit the proof.

Simple fold maps and compact manifolds bounded by the source manifolds of the maps

As main works, in this section, we consider simple fold maps satisfying appropriate conditions on regular fibers and extra algebraic and differential topological conditions and construct manifolds bounded by their source manifolds. We review results on simple fold maps and stable maps whose regular fibers are disjoint unions of spheres and then, we prove Theorems [\ref=thm:1]-[\ref=thm:3].

Simple fold maps whose regular fibers are disjoint unions of spheres

We review [\cite=saekisuzuoka].

As a corollary to the proposition, we can prove the following.

See also [\cite=kitazawa2], which is a similar statement for simple fold maps whose regular fibers are disjoint unions of spheres between manifolds of arbitary dimensions.

More general simple fold maps and compact manifolds bounded by their source manifolds

We study more general simple fold maps. Before precise studies, we define several technical conditions on the maps, which we often pose in the present paper, to obtain theorems.

Let f:M  →  N be a simple fold map sastisfying m > n  ≥  1.

For each connected component C of the set qf(qf(S(f))), let N(C) be a small regular neighborhood such that qf- 1(N(C)) is regarded as the total space of a bundle over C. We call the bundle qf- 1(N(C)) a monodromy representation on C and if we can take this as a topologically trivial bundle, then f is said to have a topologically trivial monodromy on C and the bundle is said to be a topologically trivial monodromy bundle on C. If f has a topologically trivial monodromy on C for each component C, then f is said to have topologically trivial monodromies on the singular part.

We can replace "topologically" by "PL" and "smooth" and define similar terminologies.

Let N(qf(S(f))) be a small regular neighborhood of the set qf(S(f)). For any connected component R of the set Wf  -  IntN(qf(S(f))), qf- 1(R) is regarded as the total space of a bundle over R. We call the bundle qf- 1(R) a monodromy representation on R and if we can choose the bundle qf- 1(R) as a topologically trivial bundle, then f is said to have a topologically trivial monodromy on R and the bundle is said to be a topologically trivial monodromy bundle on R. If f has a topologically trivial monodromy on R for each component R, then f is said to have topologically trivial monodromies on the regular part.

We can replace "topologically" by "PL" and "smooth" and define similar terminologies.

We can easily obtain a topological manifold W by gluing the following (m + 1)-dimensional manifolds.

The total space WR of the topologically trivial ER-bundle over R explained in the assumption.

The total space WC of a topologically trivial EC-bundle over C such that the trivial FC-bundle over C explained in the assumption is a subbundle of this bundle satisfying ∂EC = FC.

We can obtain W as a PL (smooth) manifold in the PL (resp. smooth) case.

We show additional statements in the PL case and by using a similar method we can show them in the smooth case.

For any connected component R of Wf  -  IntN(qf(S(f))), by considering a handle decomposition of ER in the PL category, we obtain a polyhedron which ER collapses to and whose dimension is smaller than that of ER and thus, we obtain a trivial PL subbundle VR of the trivial PL bundle WR over R whose fiber is a PL manifold ER. VR is a polyhedron whose dimension is smaller than that of WR and we obtain a polyhedron [formula], continuous maps rR:WR  →  VR and sR:VR  →  R and triangulations of WR, VR, [formula] and R so that they satisfy desired conditions.

For any connected component C of the set qf(S(f)), by considering a handle decomposition of EC in the PL category, we obtain a polyhedron which EC collapses to and whose dimension is smaller than that of EC and thus, we obtain a trivial PL subbundle VC of the trivial PL bundle WC over R whose fiber is a PL manifold EC. We can take VC so that we can attach [formula] with the disjoint union of [formula] for every Cλ compatiably together.

This completes the proof.

We have the following corollary similar to Corollary [\ref=cor:1], which we prove later with Corollary [\ref=cor:3].

As specific cases, we have the following two statements.

The first statement follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=thm:1]. We can prove the second statement by noticing that a sphere bundle is naturally a subbundle of a disc bundle whose dimension is larger than that of the sphere bundle by one.

We introduce and prove Theorem [\ref=thm:3], which is regarded as an extension of a specific case of Theorem [\ref=thm:2] ([\ref=thm:2.2]). We define the mapping cylinder of a continuous map c:X  →  Y as the quotient space of [formula] obtained by identifying (x,1) and c(x) (x∈X).

We construct a compact PL manifold of dimension m + 1 bounded by M. We denote the set of all the singular points of index i by Fi(f). Step 1    Around a regular neighborhood of qf(F0(f)).

qf(F0(f)) is the image of the set F0(f) of all the definite fold points of f. Let N(qf(F0(f))) be a small regular neighborhood of qf(F0(f)) as in Proposition [\ref=prop:1] ([\ref=prop:1.3]). N(qf(F0(f))) is regarded as the total space of a trivial PL bundle over qf(F0(f)) with the fiber

[formula]

-bundle over Gk(f) and Gk(f) is the image of the section corresponding to the point 0∈[ -  1,1]. Step 3    Around the set [formula].

This set is a compact manifold of dimension n and let {Rλ}λ∈Λ be the family of all the connected components of the set. Rλ is in an AS-region or an S-region.

Let Rλ be in an AS-region. Then, qf- 1(Rλ) is regarded as the total space of a smooth bundle over Rλ whose fiber is PL homeomorphic to Sm - n. We can define a PL Dm - n + 1-bundle VRλ over Rλ which is an associated bundle of the bundle qf- 1(Rλ) over Rλ (we regard Sm - n  =  ∂Dm - n + 1) by a PL map rRλ:VRλ  →  Rλ. In addition, we take the associated bundle so that the structure group is a group consisting of PL homeomorphisms r on Dm - n + 1 such that r(0) = 0 and that for a PL homeomorphism [formula] on Sm - n, [formula] (x  ≠  0). Let [formula] be the section of the associated bundle corresponding to the point 0∈Dm - n + 1. Finally we set P(Rλ): = Rλ and let sRλ:P(Rλ)  →  Rλ be the identity map.

Let Rλ be in a k S-region whose closure is bounded by a disjoint union of k S-loci. Then, qf- 1(Rλ) is regarded as the total space of a smooth bundle over Rλ whose fiber is PL homeomorphic to Sk  ×  Sm - n - k. We can take a PL (Sk  ×  Dm - n - k + 1)-bundle VRλ over Rλ which is an associated bundle of the bundle qf- 1(Rλ) over Rλ (we regard Sk  ×  Sm - n - k = Sk  ×  ∂Dm - n - k + 1). In addition ,we take the associated bundle so that the structure group is a group consisting of some PL homeomorphisms r on Sk  ×  Dm - n - k + 1 such that r is a bundle isomorphism on a PL bundle Sk  ×  Dm - n - k + 1 over Sk whose structure group consists of PL homeomorphisms r1 on Dm - n - k + 1, where r1(0) = 0 and for a PL homeomorphism r2 on Sm - n - k, [formula] (x  ≠  0) and that r induces a PL homeomorphism on the base space Sk. Let [formula] be the subbundle whose fiber is Sk  ×  {0}  ⊂  Sk  ×  Dm - n - k + 1. The bundle VRλ over Rλ is also given by the composition of two PL maps rRλ:VRλ  →  P(Rλ) and sRλ:P(Rλ)  →  Rλ, where P(Rλ) is a PL manifold and by sRλ makes P(Rλ) a bundle over Rλ equivalent to the bundle [formula] over Rλ.

Now we set disjoint unions [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Step 4    Around a regular neighborhood of Gk(f) (2  ≤  k  ≤  m - n)

After Steps 1, 2 and 3, for any connected component Ck of Gk(f) and a small regular neighborhood N(Ck) of Ck as in Proposition [\ref=prop:1] ([\ref=prop:1.4]), we obtain a PL bundle over Ck whose fiber is an (m - n + 1)-dimensional PL manifold BCk simple homotopy equivalent to Sm - n - k + 1 whose boundary ∂BCk is Sk - 1  ×  Sm - n - k + 1 with the product manifold Dm - n - k + 2  ×  Sk - 1 attached by the product of a pair of PL homeomorphisms (φC1k:∂Dm - n - k + 2  →  Sm - n - k + 1,φC2k:Sk - 1  →  Sk - 1) and that the bundle qf- 1(N(Ck)) is a subbundle of the BCk-bundle.

We obtain the following objects.

A PL Dm - n + 2-bundle VCk over CK (let Vp denote the fiber over p of the base space) such that the subbundle ∂VCk corresponding to [formula] is the PL Sm - n + 1-bundle in the previous paragraph. The bundle q- 1f(N(Ck)) over Ck is a subbundle of the bundle VCk and is in the boundary of VCk (we regard it is also a subbundle of the BCk-bundle).

A PL bundle P(Ck) whose fiber is the mapping cylinder of the constant map ck:Sk - 1  →  [0,1] satisfying ck(Sk - 1) = {0} and whose base space is Ck.

Simplicial maps rCk:VCk  →  P(Ck) and sCk:P(Ck)  →  N(Ck) such that sCk- 1(p) is a point for p in the closure of an AS-region, that sCk- 1(p) is PL homeomorphic to Sk - 1 for p in a k - 1 S-region, that rCk- 1(q) is PL homeomorphic to Dm - n + 1 for q∈sCk- 1(p) for p in an AS-region, that rCk- 1(q) is PL homeomorphic to Dm - n - k + 2 for q∈sCk- 1(p) for p in a k - 1 S-region and that [formula] for all p∈Ck ({p}  ×  [ -  1,1] is a fiber of the bundle N(Ck) over Ck; N(Ck) is regarded as the total space of a trivial PL

[formula]

[formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Thus, by gluing the manifolds V0, VB, VR and VG together, we obtain the desired manifold V. We can obtain other desired objects. This completes the proof.

We have the following corollary.

Since r is a homotopy equivalence, we have only to show that [formula] (0  ≤  k  ≤  m -  dim V - 1) is an isomorphism. Since W collapses to a polyhedron of dimension dim V, it is regarded as a polyhedron consisting of handles whose indices are not larger than dim V. By dualizing the handles, V is regarded as a PL manifold obtained by attaching handles whose indices are not smaller than m -  dim V + 1 along the component M  ×  {1} of M  ×  [0,1]. Hence, the homomorphism [formula] (0  ≤  k  ≤  m -  dim V - 1) is an isomorphism and this completes the proof.
