Enumeration of the adjunctive hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets

Introduction

Sets are basic mathematical and computational objects; usually one considers sets of two kinds: pure sets, that is, sets which, unless empty, contain only other pure sets as elements; or sets with atoms, that is, sets which can also have as elements objects from a given collection of atoms, or urelements. In this paper we focus mainly on sets which are pure and hereditarily finite, in the sense that they are finite, and all of their members are hereditarily finite sets.

This paper is motivated by an effort to cross-fertilize set theory and computer science, started by Jacob T. Schwartz in the 1970s. This field, called computable set theory in [\cite=CFO89], has led, on the one hand, to set-based programming languages such as [formula] [\cite=SDDS86], or the more recent {log} [\cite=DovierOPR96] and CLP([formula]) [\cite=DovierPPR00]. On the other hand, it has uncovered decidable fragments of set theory [\cite=STfC] [\cite=ParlamentoPolicriti1991]. One emblematic example is the Multi-Level-Syllogistic with Singleton fragment and its enaction into the automatic proof-checker Referee/Æ tnaNova [\cite=REF2] [\cite=Computational-Logic-and-Set-Theory].

These combined efforts have raised the need for efficient computer representations of hereditarily finite sets. One such representation can simply be a bijection between hereditarily finite sets and natural numbers; in this case one is also interested in so-called ranking/unranking algorithms. By an efficient representation we mean that less 'complex' sets have smaller encodings; or, otherwise stated, that sets having 'complexity' n be encoded with a number of bits polynomial in n.

Any such representation depends on the measure of 'complexity' of the sets. Since the family of hereditarily finite sets, denoted as Vω, is usually defined by an iterative bottom-up construction starting from the empty set, the 'complexity' of a set is the stage of this iterative process at which it is constructed. Consider the usual von Neumann's cumulative hierarchy [\cite=Jech:2003ly] obtained by repeatedly taking the family of subsets of the sets constructed so far. Formally,

[formula]

where P denotes the power-set operator. The first levels of this hierarchy are:

[formula],

[formula],

[formula].

In the case of the cumulative hierarchy, the 'complexity' of a set x is that level n such that [formula]; number n - 1 is also called the rank of the set x [\cite=Jech:2003ly]. An encoding of hereditarily finite sets w.r.t. the cumulative hierarchy must place the sets in [formula] after all the sets in Vn - 1, for all n  ≥  1. One such encoding is the classical Ackermann's encoding [\cite=Ack37], recursively defined as [formula] and [formula]. However, since |Vn|  =  2|Vn - 1| holds for all n  ≥  1, any encoding of hereditarily finite sets w.r.t. the cumulative hierarchy is not feasible in practice--as also noted in [\cite=Chiaruttini-Omodeo-08] [\cite=Kirby]--, since one needs a super-exponential number of bits to represent a set in [formula].

An alternative approach is a combinatorial one. In order to avoid further complications, let us restrict our exposition to transitive sets (a set x is transitive if all elements of x are also subsets of x), and denote by Tn the family of transitive hereditarily finite sets with at most n elements. In the case of the hierarchy Tn, the 'complexity' of a transitive hereditarily finite set x is just its cardinality. For this hierarchy, an efficient representation exists, since [formula] is O(2n2), and any set in [formula] can be ranked/unranked using O(n5) bit operations [\cite=DBLP:journals/ipl/RizziT13]. This result uses a recurrence relation for [formula]; the enumeration problem was initially solved in [\cite=P62] (see also [\cite=Comtet74]), and also by a different method in [\cite=DBLP:journals/ipl/PolicritiT11]. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of this recurrence was recently determined in [\cite=DBLP:conf/analco/Wagner12] [\cite=Wagner:2012fk].

Even though satisfactory from a combinatorial point of view, this approach lacks set theoretic motivation, as the 'complexity' of a set does not reflect a natural set theoretic operation leading to its production (as the cumulative hierarchy does). A possible solution was proposed by Kirby in [\cite=Kirby]. Kirby used the well-known fact that hereditarily finite sets can also be obtained from the empty set by repeated use of the adjunction (or adduction) operator [\cite=givant]:

[formula]

In view of this fact, Kirby proposed the following natural hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets, which he called the adjunctive hierarchy:

[formula]

so that An  ⊆  An + 1 for all n∈ω, and [formula]. Here, the 'complexity' of a set x is analogously taken to be that level n such that either x∈A0 and n  =  0, or [formula]. Observe that

A0  =  V1, A1  =  V2, A2  =  V3, but

|A3|  =  12  <  222  =  |V4|, |A4|  =  112  <  2222  =  |V5|.

Thus, the adjunctive hierarchy grows more slowly than the cumulative hierarchy. However, in order to ascertain the feasibility of an encoding of hereditarily finite sets w.r.t. the adjunctive hierarchy, it is crucial to exactly determine an: = |An|, for every n∈ω; this problem was left open in [\cite=Kirby], where the values of an for n  ≤  6 were obtained.

To begin with, in Sec. [\ref=sec-main] we give a compact recurrence relation for an, for any n∈ω. This recurrence relation can be implemented by a simple dynamic programming algorithm, which runs in polynomial time in the arithmetic model, thus allowing a fast computation of the values an (the values for n  <  10 are given in Table [\ref=table-main]). Moreover, our method allows us to impose restrictions on the sets making up a level of the adjunctive hierarchy, for example on rank, or on cardinality; this is presented in Sec. [\ref=sec:rank] and [\ref=sec:cardinality]. In Sec. [\ref=sec:urelements] we argue that all of our recurrence relations can be generalized to an analogous adjunctive hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets with atoms, in which A0 also includes an arbitrary finite set of atoms, and A0 is added to every layer of the adjunctive hierarchy.

As we will show in Sec. [\ref=sec:asymptotics], the adjunctive hierarchy is not able to meet the goal of a hierarchy allowing an efficient encoding of hereditarily finite sets, since an is seen to have a number of bits exponential in n. More precisely, we prove that an  ~  C2n for a constant C  ≈  1.3399. Nevertheless, in Sec. [\ref=sec:bounded], we show that the growth of the adjunctive hierarchy can be controlled by any unbounded sublinear function f limiting the maximum level of the hierarchy from where the new adjoined element can be drawn. Our recurrence relation easily generalizes to this context, and in the Appendix we give numerical values for different choices of f. This restriction turns out to be a natural lever for slowing down the asymptotic growth of the hierarchy An.

More importantly, we identify a natural hierarchy Ān, which we call the minimally bounded adjunctive hierarchy, whose asymptotic behavior we prove to be Θ(2n). In this hierarchy, in order to make up the (n + 1)th level, the adjunction of a set y∈Ām + 1 to a set x∈Ān is allowed only if all the sets in P(Ām) are already present in Ān; that is, when the adjunction of any set in Ām to sets in Ān does not produce any new set. To the best of our knowledge, this hierarchy is the first to have a slow growth and a natural definition, as it can be seen as a combination of the adjunctive and cumulative hierarchies.

The adjunctive hierarchy

Adjunctive rank and basic properties

We start by presenting some remarks and basic properties that will be used to prove the main result.

If x∈An, then |x|  ≤  n, x  ⊆  An - 1 and for any y  ⊆  x, y∈An holds.

If [formula], then x  ⊆  An - 1 and there exists a y∈x such that [formula].

The rank of a hereditarily finite set x is a well-known measure of its complexity [\cite=Jech:2003ly], and can be defined as

[formula]

Equivalently stated, the rank of x is either 0, if [formula], or otherwise it can be recursively expressed as

[formula]

In analogy with the usual cumulative hierarchy, we introduce the following definition.

For every hereditarily finite set x, the adjunctive rank of x is defined as

[formula]

Equivalently, [formula] is either 0, if [formula], or it is the number n such that [formula].

As in the cumulative case, we are interested in finding an equivalent recursive definition of [formula] using the set [formula]. This is possible, even if slightly trickier than in the classical case.

For all hereditarily finite sets x,y, the following holds:

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula].

Unfortunately, it is not true that when [formula] the adjunctive rank of [formula] is [formula] (e.g. when [formula], [formula]). However, for any hereditarily finite set z, this can be avoided for a specific choice of sets x, y such that [formula], and this will allow us to state the following recursive definition of [formula] from [formula].

If [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula], then [formula].

We prove the statement by induction on n. If n = 1, the thesis follows from Remark [\ref=remark-rka1] for [formula].

Now suppose that n > 1. From the inductive hypothesis, we have

[formula]

If [formula], from Remark [\ref=remark-rka1] we have

[formula]

which is the thesis.

Otherwise, [formula]. From Remark [\ref=remark-basic], we know that there exists an i such that [formula]. Applying Remark [\ref=remark-rka0] together with [formula], it follows that

[formula]

By the inductive hypothesis on [formula], we have that

[formula]

Since for all [formula], [formula] holds from the assumption that the xi's form a non-decreasing sequence, this implies that [formula]. Thus, by the hypothesis on [formula], it holds that

[formula]

Combining the last inequalities with our assumption on i,

[formula]

which, by Remark [\ref=remark-rka0], proves the thesis.

In the next sections, Lemma [\ref=lemma-rka] will be used mainly in the form of the following corollary.

If [formula], then [formula].

The recurrence relation for an

To develop a recurrence relation for the sequence an we first need to define a finer sequence, as in the following definition.

For every n  >  m  ≥  0, let Bn,m be the set [formula], and let bn,m: = |Bn,m|.

Notice that [formula] and [formula] for all n  >  1; we shall extend for convenience the definitions of Bn,m and, accordingly, of bn,m, to all integers n,m, by assuming [formula] if n < 0. Therefore, we can write

[formula]

For the sequence bn,m a compact recurrence relation can be provided.

For all natural numbers n  >  m  ≥  0, the following recurrence relation holds

[formula]

where b0, - 1  =  1, and bn, - 1  =  0, for all n  ≥  1 (we assume that [formula] if a  <  b).

The recurrence relation above follows from partitioning the set Bn,m into sets Bn,m,k, for [formula]:

[formula]

This is indeed a partition of Bn,m, since for any x∈Bn,m, [formula] holds. Otherwise, denote [formula] by l, and suppose that l  ≥  n - m + 1. Therefore, x  ⊆  Am is obtained by adjoining l elements in [formula] to a set in some Ad; by Corollary [\ref=corollary-rka] (applied l times), we have that d  ≤  n - l  ≤  m - 1. However, by the first adjunction of such an element in [formula], we obtain, by Remark [\ref=remark-rka1], a set in [formula]. By the adjunction of the remaining l  -  1  ≥  n - m elements to it, we obtain, by Corollary [\ref=corollary-rka], that the set x is in [formula]. Since l  +  m  ≥  n  +  1, this contradicts the assumption that x∈Bn,m.

By definition, Bn,m,0  =  Bn,m - 1, which gives the first term in the recurrence relation.

For [formula], every set x∈Bn,m,k is obtained by adjoining k sets in [formula], that can be chosen in [formula] ways, to a set y∈An - k such that y  ⊆  Am - 1. Observe that y∉An - k - 1, since adjoining k elements in Am, where m  ≤  n - k - 1, to a set in An - k - 1 would result in a set in An - 1, by the definition of the hierarchy. Therefore, such sets y are precisely those in Bn - k,m - 1, hence [formula], giving the next term in the recurrence relation.

Similarly, if k  =  n - m, every set x∈Bn,m,n - m is obtained adjoining n - m sets in [formula], that can be chosen in [formula] ways, to a set y∈Am. In this case, however, any set in Am can be used as y, since adjoining n - m sets in [formula] to a set in Am will always produce a set in [formula], by Corollary [\ref=corollary-rka]. This gives the last term in the recurrence relation.

This result can be implemented in an algorithm, to obtain the numeric values shown in Table [\ref=table-adj].

Asymptotic behavior

In this section, we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the sum

[formula]

To this end, we first study the asymptotics of cn: = bn,n - 1. First we note that

[formula]

by definition (since Bn,m - 1  ⊆  Bn,m), which can also be seen from the fact that all the terms in [\eqref=eq:rec] are nonnegative. Moreover, for m  =  n - 1, one of the terms on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:rec] is b2n - 1,n - 2 (corresponding to k = m = n - 1 in the second sum), so that

[formula]

It turns out that this is in fact the dominant term (combinatorially speaking, this means that "most" of the elements of [formula] are obtained by adjoining an element of [formula] to another set in [formula]), as the following lemma shows:

The sequence cn  =  bn,n - 1 satisfies

[formula]

Specifically,

[formula]

for n  ≥  2.

The inequality c2n - 1  ≤  cn has already been mentioned. It also follows from this inequality that c2kn - k  ≤  cn for 0  ≤  k  ≤  n, and since c2  =  2, we have cn  ≥  22n - 2 for all n  ≥  2 by a simple induction, which means that cn grows quite rapidly. Finally, we have cn  ≥  c2n - 1  ≥  2cn - 1 for n  ≥  3 (and also c2  =  2  ≥  2  =  2c1), hence 2kcn - k  ≤  cn for n  ≥  2 and k  ≤  n - 1.

It remains to prove the second inequality. The special case m = n - 1 in [\eqref=eq:rec] yields

[formula]

and thus also (replacing n by n - 1)

[formula]

from which we obtain

[formula]

Moreover, [\eqref=eq:sum_ineq] implies

[formula]

which we will use later. To complete the proof, we have to show that

[formula]

To this end, we iterate our recursion [\eqref=eq:rec] to obtain

[formula]

We split this into three parts: k = 1 in the first sum gives us

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq:increasing] and [\eqref=eq:sumest]. The other terms of the first sum taken together can be estimated as follows (note that [formula] for r = 0 or r = 1 now, since b0, - 1  =  b1,0 = 1):

[formula]

since bn - k,r - 1  ≤  bn - k,n - k - 1  =  cn - k by [\eqref=eq:increasing] and br,r - 1  =  cr. Making use of the inequalities c2kn - k  ≤  cn and 2kcn - k  ≤  cn mentioned at the beginning of the proof, it follows that

[formula]

Finally, we have

[formula]

again by [\eqref=eq:sum_ineq] and the inequalities c2kn - k  ≤  cn and 2kcn - k  ≤  cn. The desired inequality follows by adding the three parts S1, S2 and S3.

Now we are ready to prove the main asymptotic formula:

We have

[formula]

for a constant C  ≈  1.339899757746.

Set un  =   log cn. By Lemma [\ref=lem:main_lemma], we have

[formula]

with [formula] for n  ≥  2. Iterating yields

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Since [formula] for [formula], we have

[formula]

thus

[formula]

and consequently

[formula]

So cn  ~  C2n, and more precisely

[formula]

completing our proof.

The following corollary is now immediate:

The sequence [formula] is asymptotically given by

[formula]

We have

[formula]

The series representation

[formula]

for the constant C converges quite rapidly, so it can be computed with high accuracy.

Refinements and generalizations

Refining by rank

The value [formula] computed in the previous section is the number of hereditarily finite sets in An having adjunctive rank n. Therefore, it is interesting to analogously determine how many elements in An have a certain rank in the classical sense.

Observe first that for any x∈An, [formula] holds. With this purpose we introduce the following definition.

For every n  >  m  ≥  0, and every 0  ≤  t  ≤  m + 1, let [formula], and let rtn,m: = |Rtn,m|.

Let [formula], and observe that [formula]. The values rtn,m satisfy a relation completely analogous to the one in Theorem [\ref=thm-main]; numerical values of rtn for small values of n and t are shown in Table [\ref=table-rank].

For all natural numbers n  >  m  ≥  0, and 0  ≤  t  ≤  m + 1, the following recurrence relation holds

[formula]

where rt0, - 1  =  1, and rtn, - 1  =  0, for all n  ≥  1 and t  ≥  0.

The proof follows step by step the one of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. Since Rtn,m  ⊆  Bn,m, we can partition the set Rtn,m into sets Rtn,m,k, for [formula]:

[formula]

Again, the first term of the recurrence comes from the fact that Rtn,m,0  =  Rtn,m - 1.

For [formula], every set x∈Rtn,m,k is obtained by adjoining k sets in [formula] with rank at most t - 1 (hence in Rt - 1m,m - 1), to a set y∈An - k such that y  ⊆  Am - 1 with rank at most t. As before, y∉An - k - 1 hence such sets y are precisely those in Rtn - k,m - 1. This gives the next term in the recurrence relation.

Similarly, if k  =  n - m every set x∈Rtn,m,n - m is obtained by adjoining n - m sets in [formula] with rank at most t - 1 (hence in Rt - 1m,m - 1), to any set y∈Am with rank at most t (by Corollary [\ref=corollary-rka]). This gives the last term in the recurrence relation.

Refining by cardinality

In this section we extend Theorem [\ref=thm-main] by imposing a restriction on the cardinality of the sets in some An. Observe that for any x∈An, |x|  ≤  n holds.

For every n  >  m  ≥  0, and every 0  ≤  t  ≤  n, let [formula], and let dtn,m: = |Dtn,m|.

As in the previous section, we observe that dtn: = |{x∈An: ~ |x|  =  t}| equals [formula], and the values dtn,m satisfy a recurrence relation similar to the one in Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. Numerical values of dtn are shown in Table [\ref=table-cardinality].

For all natural numbers n  >  m  ≥  0, and 0  ≤  t  ≤  n, the following recurrence relation holds

[formula]

where dt0, - 1  =  1, and dtn, - 1  =  0, for all n  ≥  1 and t  ≥  0.

The proof follows step by step the one of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. Since Dtn,m  ⊆  Bn,m, we can partition the set Dtn,m into sets Dtn,m,k, for [formula]:

[formula]

Again, the first term of the recurrence comes from the fact that Dtn,m,0  =  Dtn,m - 1.

For [formula], every set x∈Dtn,m,k is obtained by adjoining any k sets in [formula] (hence in Bm,m - 1), to a set y∈An - k such that y  ⊆  Am - 1 with cardinality at most t - k. As before, y∉An - k - 1 hence such sets y are precisely those in Dt - kn - k,m - 1. This gives the next term in the recurrence relation.

Similarly, if k  =  n - m every set x∈Dtn,m,n - m is obtained by adjoining any n - m sets in [formula] (hence in Bm,m - 1), to any set y∈Am with cardinality at most t - (n - m) (by Corollary [\ref=corollary-rka]). This gives the last term in the recurrence relation.

Hereditarily finite sets with atoms

Pure hereditarily finite sets can be generalized in a straightforward manner by allowing the presence of a set U of urelements, or atoms, pairwise different and also different from sets (and in particular from [formula]). The cumulative hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets with atoms U is defined as (see also [\cite=DBLP:journals/ipl/PolicritiT11] [\cite=Chiaruttini-Omodeo-08]):

[formula]

The adjunctive hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets with urelements U can be analogously defined as:

[formula]

[formula]

so that [formula].

It is easy to see that, for a finite U, all recurrences proposed in this paper generalize to AUn, the only differences being in the initialization of the recurrences. For example, to obtain an analog of Theorem [\ref=thm-main], denote by BUn,m the set [formula], and by bun,m the cardinality |BUn,m|, where u  =  |U|, so that

[formula]

For all natural numbers n  >  m  ≥  1, the following recurrence relation holds

[formula]

where bu0, - 1  =  u + 1, and [formula] for all n  ≥  1.

The proof follows closely the one of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. The only difference is in the fact that the only set in A0 allowed as first term in an adjunction is the empty set, thus giving [formula] instead of [formula].

Numeric values of |AUn| are shown in Table [\ref=table-urelements].

Bounded adjunctive hierarchies

As Theorem [\ref=thm:asymp] shows, the growth of an, albeit slower than in the von Neumann's case, is still very fast, the an's having an exponential number (to be more precise, Θ(2n)) of bits.

This observation motivates us to introduce bounded analogues of the adjunctive hierarchy in order to obtain slower asymptotic growth, ideally one in which the cardinalities of the different layers have a linear number of bits.

Given an unbounded sublinear function [formula] (that is, for all n, f(n)  ≤  n, and there exists an m such that f(m) > n), the adjunctive hierarchy bounded by f is

[formula]

We let afn  =  |Afn|.

Kirby's adjunctive hierarchy is obtained for f the identity function. As in that case, it also holds that for any unbounded sublinear function f, Afn  ⊆  Afn + 1 for all n∈ω, and [formula]; that is, Afn is a hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets. By changing the asymptotic growth of f(n), it is possible to fine-tune the asymptotic behavior of afn. In order to obtain numeric values for the afn, it is possible to prove an analogue of the relation in Theorem [\ref=thm-main].

For every n  >  m  ≥  0, let Bfn,m be the set [formula], bfn,m: = |Bfn,m| and [formula] be such that g(n)  =   min {t: ~ f(t)  ≥  n}. We call this last function the inverse of f.

For all natural numbers n  >  m  ≥  0, the following recurrence relation holds

[formula]

where bf0, - 1  =  1, and bfn, - 1  =  0, for all n  >  1.

The proof follows step by step the one of Theorem [\ref=thm-main], using the fact that adjoining k elements not in Afm - 1 to any set gives a set that is not in Afg(m) + k - 1, and is left to the reader.

In Tables [\ref=table-2bound] and [\ref=table-sqrtbound] in the Appendix we present numeric values of afn for some specific choices of f. When f is not the identity function it can happen that Afn + 1  =  Afn, in this case we feel free to skip the corresponding entries in the tables. These empirical results suggest that for f(n)  =  ⌊ log 2(n + 1)⌋ and possibly also for [formula], the number of digits needed to represent afn is less than n.

As suggested from Table [\ref=table-sqrtbound], for functions f growing sufficiently slowly and smoothly in some sense, the corresponding sequence Afn is essentially the same (ignoring repetitions). In such cases we obtain a hierarchy equivalent to the following.

The minimally bounded adjunctive hierarchy is

[formula]

We let ān: = |Ān|.

In this sequence, the adjunction of a set y∈Ām + 1 is allowed only if all the sets obtainable à la von Neumann from Ām are already in the hierarchy, that is, P(Ām)  ⊆  Ān, so that the adjunction of any set in Ām to sets in Ān would not produce any new set.

Observe that also Ān - 1  ⊆  Ān holds for all n∈ω.

For all n, Āān  =  P(Ān).

We prove the thesis by induction on n. For n = 0, since [formula] then ā0  =  1, and [formula] is easily checked to be true.

Now suppose that Āān - 1  =  P(Ān - 1). We prove by another induction that for all m such that ān - 1  ≤  m  ≤  ān, the following holds:

[formula]

We will obtain the claim for m  =  ān, since plainly

[formula]

For m  =  ān - 1 it is true by the initial inductive hypothesis, since

[formula]

Let m  >  ān - 1 and assume that the hypothesis holds for Ām - 1. Since m  ≤  ān, this implies that [formula]. Therefore, by the definition and the fact that Āān - 1  =  P(Ān - 1) holds, we have that

[formula]

This proves the claim, since the inductive hypothesis holds for Ām - 1.

The last result shows that for infinitely many n (i.e. if there exists m such that ām  =  n), ān  =  2n hence the asymptotic growth of ān is Θ(2n). It also follows that Ā|Vn|  =  Vn + 1, thus the sequence ān contains the usual von Neumann's hierarchy as a subsequence.

The sequence Ān is obtained as [formula] where the function [formula] is defined as

[formula]

Thus, the corresponding inverse [formula] is such that (n)  =  ān - 1, (0)  =  0.

As previously mentioned, any other surjective function f with inverse g (as defined in Definition [\ref=def-inverse]) such that g(n + 1)  -  g(n)  ≥  (n + 1)  -  (n) holds for all n will produce the same sequence, possibly with repetitions. Moreover, it is possible to combine Theorem [\ref=thm-bounded] and Corollary [\ref=corollary-bounded] to produce a recursive relation for [formula]:

[formula]

where ām is definable from the values n,m as [formula]. This recursive relation can be implemented in a dynamic programming algorithm analogous to the one for bn,m; small numerical values of it are shown in Table [\ref=table-minbound] in the Appendix.

Conclusions and future work

In this paper we solved a counting problem proposed by Kirby in 2008, and showed that our method can be extended by imposing restrictions on the rank or on the cardinality of the hereditarily finite sets making up a certain level of the adjunctive hierarchy. We also showed that it can be easily extended to hereditarily finite sets with atoms.

An asymptotic analysis of the recurrences revealed that the adjunctive hierarchy, even though much slower than the usual cumulative hierarchy, is still growing too fast to allow for an efficient encoding of hereditarily finite sets by numbers.

For this reason, we proposed the minimally bounded adjunctive hierarchy, in which an (n + 1)th level is obtained by the adjunction of a set y∈Ām + 1 to a set x∈Ān if all the sets in P(Ām) are already present in Ān. This is a natural combination of the adjunctive hierarchy and the cumulative hierarchy; more importantly, we proved that its asymptotic growth is Θ(2n). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of this kind.

The next step to take is to devise efficient ranking/unranking algorithms for our minimally bounded adjunctive hierarchy, as Ackermann's encoding [\cite=Ack37] is for the cumulative hierarchy, and as the algorithms in [\cite=DBLP:journals/ipl/RizziT13] are for the hierarchy of transitive sets with a given number of elements.

A different open problem can be formulated as follows. Note that all transitive sets with n elements belong to Vn, and recall that the number of transitive sets with n elements has already been obtained in [\cite=P62]; it would thus be interesting to find an analog of this result for the adjunctive hierarchy, namely, to find the number of transitive sets in An with n elements.
