ABSTRACT -- Motivated by the recent developments in the determination of the experimental values of the nucleon axial-vector coupling constant gA and the pion-nucleon coupling constant gπNN, we carry out a heavy-baryon chiral perturbation calculation of the hyperfine-singlet μp capture rate Γ0 to next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO), with the use of the latest values of gA and gπNN. The calculated N2LO value is Γtheor0(μ-p  →  νμn) = 718  ±  7  s- 1, where the estimated N3LO contribution dominates the error. This value is in excellent agreement with the experimental value reported by the MuCap Collaboration.

Muon capture on the proton has been the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigations; for reviews, see Refs. [\cite=Fearing2003] [\cite=Kammel2010]. Recently, the MuCap Collaboration succeeded in measuring, to 1 % precision, the rate Γ0 of muon capture from the hyperfine-singlet state of a μp atom [\cite=MuCap2007]. The reported experimental value is

Heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT) provides a systematic framework for calculating Γtheor0, and a number of HBChPT-based calculations have been reported [\cite=Ando2000] [\cite=Bernard2001] [\cite=Udit2013]. HBChPT [\cite=bkm95] [\cite=Bernard2009] [\cite=Scherer] involves two perturbative expansions, one in terms of the expansion parameter Q / Λχ  ≪  1 and the other in terms of Q / mN  ≪  1. Here Q is a typical four-momentum transfer involved in the reaction, mN is the nucleon mass, and Λχ ≃ 4πfπ ≃ 1  GeV is the chiral scale. In order for the theory to match the experimental precision of 1%, one needs to incorporate higher order terms in the expansion in Q / Λχ and Q / mN. In Ref. [\cite=Udit2013] (to be referred to as RMK), Raha et al. evaluated Γtheor0 including correction terms up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO). They reported [formula] which at N2LO includes radiative corrections and finite proton size effect. The evaluation of Γtheor0 in HBChPT at N2LO involves several low-energy constants (LECs), and the accuracy of the calculated value of Γtheor0 at this order depends on the precision with which these LECs are known. Additional uncertainties are due to the truncation at N2LO of HBChPT expansion. The rate of convergence estimated from the leading order (LO), the next-to-leading order (NLO) and the N2LO contributions to Γtheor0 found in Refs. [\cite=Ando2000] [\cite=Bernard2001] [\cite=Udit2013], indicates that N3LO corrections would contribute at most ~  1% [\cite=Udit2013]. In the following we shall primarily concentrate on the uncertainties associated with the N2LO evaluation of Γtheor0. As emphasized in RMK, the above 0.7% theoretical error is dominated by the possible variations in the experimental values of the nucleon axial-vector coupling constant, gA, and the pion-nucleon coupling constant, gπNN. This situation motivates us to pay particular attention to recent highly noteworthy developments regarding the experimental values of gA [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013] and gπNN [\cite=Baru2011], and to reexamine the value of Γtheor0, taking into account these developments. The purpose of the present note is to report on such a study.

We first briefly summarize the treatment of the LECs in RMK. An N2LO calculation of Γtheor0 involves four LECs: gA, 2, 3, and 10. 2 is determined from the Goldberger-Treiman (GT) discrepancy

[formula]

while Refs. [\cite=bkm95] [\cite=bfhm98] relate 3 and 10 to the nucleon mean squared axial radius 〈r2A〉 and the nucleon isovector mean squared charge radius 〈r2V〉, respectively, via

[formula]

Since the term associated with 10 gives only ~  0.1% contribution to Γtheor0, and since 〈r2V〉 is relatively well known [\cite=Simon1980] [\cite=Lorenz2012], variations in Γtheor0 due to the uncertainty in 〈r2V〉 can be safely ignored; RMK used a fixed value, 〈r2V〉1 / 2  =  0.765 fm [\cite=Mergell96]. The terms associated with 2 and 3 give ~  0.7% and ~  1.9% contribution to Γtheor0, respectively, implying a more pronounced sensitivity of Γtheor0 to variations in the input parameters entering 2 and 3. As for the 3 contribution, RMK found that ~  10% variation in 〈r2A〉1 / 2 (or equivalently, in the axial mass parameter mA) causes ~  0.3% changes in Γtheor0, which are not totally negligible; it is to be noted that the 10 % variation is a rather ample allowance for the uncertainty in 〈r2A〉1 / 2. The value of gπNN, which affects 2 via ΔGT, was extracted from nucleon-nucleon scattering and pion-nucleon scattering [\cite=Nijmegen1997] [\cite=KH83] [\cite=Ericson2002] [\cite=Bugg2003], but the resulting values show significant scatter. As an estimated range of variation in gπNN, RMK adopted gπNN   =   13.044--13.40, the smaller value taken from Ref. [\cite=Nijmegen1997] and the larger value from Ref. [\cite=KH83]. Variations in gπNN within this range lead to ~   0.2 % changes in Γtheor0. For gA, RMK employed as an estimate of its uncertainty the difference between the PDG 2002 value and the PDG 2012 value [\cite=PDG2002] [\cite=PDG2010] [\cite=PDG2012]. Variations in gA within this range cause ~   0.6 % changes in Γtheor0; these changes arise primarily from the overall multiplicative factor (1   +   3g2A) that enters the expression for Γtheor0, and also from the contribution of the 2 term. The estimated theoretical uncertainty of 0.7 % in Γtheor0 was obtained by taking the quadratic sum of the above-mentioned individual errors. It is noteworthy that the radiative corrections, which contribute about 2 % to Γtheor0 [\cite=Sirlin2007], are well under control and do not affect the uncertainty in Γtheor0; see Ref. [\cite=Udit2013] for details.

We now turn our attention to the latest experimental developments regarding gA and gπNN. Historically, the value of gA recommended by PDG has been steadily increasing, and the 2012 PDG value is gA = 1.2701  ±  0.0025 [\cite=PDG2012]. Very recently, however, two groups [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013] reported the value gA≃1.276, extracted from the measurement of the asymmetry parameter A in neutron beta decay. This new value is significantly larger than the 2012 PDG value. It is noteworthy that this new value of gA is consistent with the recently revised value of the neutron mean lifetime, τ  =  880.1  ±  1.1 s (S=1.8) [\cite=PDG2012] [\cite=Wietfeldt2011], as discussed in Ref. [\cite=Mund2013]. Furthermore, Ivanov et al. [\cite=Ivanov2013] pointed out the possibility that these new values of gA and τ resolve the "antineutrino flux anomaly", a lingering problem in the nuclear reactor neutrino-oscillation experiments. Regarding the value of gπNN, in a recent notable study [\cite=Baru2011], Baru et al. improved the Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme sum rule analysis of Ericson et al. [\cite=Ericson2002], and deduced the value, [formula]. It is worth emphasizing that Baru et al. [\cite=Baru2011] used the most recent value for the πN scattering length a+, which had been determined from the high-precision πd atom data [\cite=Strauch2010]. These important developments motivate us to re-evaluate Γtheor0 at N2LO with the use of the value of gA obtained in Refs. [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013], and the value of gπNN deduced in Ref. [\cite=Baru2011]. As will be discussed in the concluding paragraph, it is assumed here that the electromagnetic effects have been removed from these two experimentally determined hadronic constants.

In calculating Γtheor0, we use exactly the same formalism and the input parameters as employed in RMK, except the values of gA and gπNN; as explained above, we adopt here gA = 1.2758  ±  0.0016 [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013], and [formula] [\cite=Baru2011]. To assess to what extent the uncertainties in gA and gπNN affect the precision in Γtheor0, we calculate Γtheor0 for four cases. In the first and second cases, gπNN is fixed at its central value gπNN  =  13.116, while gA is taken to be at the lower or upper end of the range within the experimental error. In the third and fourth cases, gA is fixed at its central value, gA  =  1.2758, while gπNN is assumed to be at the lower or upper end of the range within the experimental error. Table [\ref=tab:predictions] shows the values of Γtheor0 along with ΔGT calculated for these four cases. We emphasize that the results in this table comprise the radiative corrections and the finite proton-size effects, as estimated in RMK. Table [\ref=tab:predictions] indicates that the uncertainty in gA causes ~  0.2% variation in Γtheor0, and that the uncertainty in gπNN leads to ~  0.1% variation. To deduce the total uncertainty in Γtheor0, we recall that, according to RMK, if one assigns 10 % error to 〈r2A〉1 / 2 (which is considered to be a rather generous error estimate), it causes about 0.3 % variations in Γtheor0 at N2LO. By taking the squared sum of the errors that arise from gA, gπNN and 〈r2A〉1 / 2, we arrive at

[formula]

It is noteworthy that the new larger value for gA [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013] increases the central value of Γtheor0 by about 0.8 %, as compared with the result in RMK; this change arises primarily from the overall factor (1   +   3g2A) contained in the expression for Γtheor0. It is also to be noted that the adoption of the new input for gA and gπNN significantly reduces the uncertainties in Γtheor0 obtained in an N2LO calculation. Corrections entering at N3LO are reasonably expected to produce at most a ~   1 % contribution to Γtheor0, uncertainties that are within the present experimental precision. Since the 0.3 % uncertainty that arises within an N2LO calculation is much smaller than that due to the possible N3LO contributions, it is reasonable to adopt the central value of Γtheor0 in Eq.([\ref=eq:GammaNew]) and attach ~   1 % error to it: Γtheor0 = 718  ×  (1  ±  0.01)   sec- 1

To summarize, we have updated the HBChPT calculation of the hyperfine-singlet μp capture rate Γtheor0 to N2LO carried out in Ref. [\cite=Udit2013], using the recently reported values of gA and gπNN. We have assumed in this work that the coupling constants, gA and gπNN, are pure hadronic constants. The electromagnetic corrections to, e.g. the asymmetry parameter, A, in polarized neutron beta decay which is used by Refs. [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013] to determine gA, are known to be very small, e.g., Ref. [\cite=FK2004] finds radiative corrections to gA determined from A to be 0.12%. As to the value of gπNN the subtraction constant in the sum rule has been extracted from pionic deuterium where, e.g., isospin violating effects are considered as well as QED effects. The hadronic cross sections entering the dispersion integrals are also assumed to have been corrected for the possible electromagnetic effects, see discussions in Ref. [\cite=Baru2011] and references therein. However, as shown in a highly illuminating paper by Gasser et al. [\cite=Gasser2003], it is virtually impossible to extract pure hadronic values for, e.g. gA and gπNN, from experimental data. With the use of gA = 1.2758  ±  0.0016 [\cite=Mund2013] [\cite=Mendenhall2013], and [formula] [\cite=Baru2011], where we assume that the errors quoted include residual electromagnetic effects, the theory favors a larger central value for Γtheor0 compared to the previous result [\cite=Udit2013]. In particular, our calculation that includes radiative and proton finite-size corrections is

[formula]

where the error is dominated by the estimated N3LO contributions. This new central value for Γtheor0 is still in excellent agreement with the experimental value, Eq. ([\ref=eq:Gammaexp]), reported by the MuCap Collaboration.
