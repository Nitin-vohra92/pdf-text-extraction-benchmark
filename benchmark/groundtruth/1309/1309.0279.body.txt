On the Classification of Homogeneous Hypersurfaces in Complex Space A. V. Isaev

Introduction

For n  ≥  2, consider the n-dimensional affine quadric in [formula]:

[formula]

The group [formula] acts on Qn, and the orbits of this action are the sphere [formula] as well as the compact strongly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces

[formula]

These hypersurfaces play an important role in the classical paper [\cite=MN], where the authors set out to determine all compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurfaces in [formula] homogeneous under an action of a Lie group by CR-transformations. They showed that every such hypersurface is CR-equivalent to either the sphere S2n - 1 or, for n = 3,7, to the manifold Mnt for some t. However, the question of the existence of a real-analytic CR-embedding of Mnt in [formula] for n = 3,7 was not clarified, thus the classification in these two dimensions was not fully completed.

In this paper, we first discuss the family Mnt for all n  ≥  2, t > 1 (see Section [\ref=sect1]). We observe that a necessary condition for the existence of a real-analytic CR-embedding of Mnt in [formula] is the embeddability of the sphere Sn in [formula] as a totally real submanifold (see Corollary [\ref=cor]). The problem of the existence of a totally real embedding of Sn in [formula] was considered by Gromov (see [\cite=Gr1] and p. 193 in [\cite=Gr2]), Stout-Zame (see [\cite=SZ]), Ahern-Rudin (see [\cite=AR]), Forstneri c (see [\cite=F1]-[\cite=F3]). In particular, it has turned out that Sn admits a totally real embedding in [formula] only for n = 3, hence Corollary [\ref=cor] implies that Mnt cannot be real-analytically CR-embedded in [formula] for all t if n  ≠  3. For n  ≠  3,7 the non-embeddability of Mnt was established in [\cite=MN] by a different method, whereas for n = 7 it appears to be a new result (see Corollary [\ref=cor2]). Furthermore, since S3 is a totally real submanifold of Q3, any real-analytic totally real embedding of S3 into [formula] extends to a biholomorphic map defined in a neighborhood of S3 in Q3. Owing to the fact that M3t accumulate to S3 as t  →  1, this observation implies that M3t admits a real-analytic CR-embedding in [formula] for all t sufficiently close to 1. Thus, the classification of homogeneous compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurfaces in complex dimension 3 is special as it includes manifolds other than the sphere S5.

Next, in [\cite=AR] an explicit polynomial totally real embedding f of S3 into [formula] was constructed, and in Section [\ref=sect2] we study the holomorphic continuation [formula] of f in order to determine the interval of parameter values 1 < t < t0 for which the extended map yields an embedding of M3t into [formula]. It turns out that the interval is rather small, namely [formula] (see Proposition [\ref=embed]). A lower bound for t0 is given in Theorem [\ref=main], where we show that t0  ≥  1 + 10- 6. Further, our discussion of the fibers of the map F leads to the conjecture asserting that one can in fact take [formula] (see Conjecture [\ref=conj]). For all other values of t the problem of the embeddability of M3t remains completely open.

The family Mnt

We start by discussing the family Mnt for all n  ≥  2, t > 1. First of all, we note that the hypersurfaces in the family are all pairwise CR-nonequivalent (see Example 13.9 in [\cite=KZ]). Next, computing the isotropy subgroups of the [formula]-action on Mnt, one observes that Mnt is diffeomorphic to [formula]. On the other hand, from ([\ref=quadric]), ([\ref=mtn]) we see that

[formula]

where [formula], hence Mnt is diffeomorphic to the tangent sphere bundle over Sn. It then follows that π1(Mnt) = 0 if n  ≥  3, [formula], and that Mnt accumulate to Sn as t  →  1. Note also that M2t is a double cover of the following well-known homogeneous hypersurface in [formula] discovered by É. Cartan (see [\cite=C]):

[formula]

For our arguments below we will utilize the strongly pseudoconvex Stein domains in Qn bounded by Mnt:

[formula]

The sphere Sn lies in Dnt for all t and is a strong deformation retract of Dnt. Indeed, the following map from Dnt  ×  [0,1] to Dnt is a strong deformation retraction of Dnt to Sn:

[formula]

In particular, Dnt is simply-connected but not contractible.

The domains Dnt illustrate the relationship between the fundamental group of a smoothly bounded Stein domain and that of its (connected) boundary, which is important, for example, for the uniformization problem. Namely, if D is a smoothly bounded Stein domain, the fundamental groups π1(D) and π1(∂D) are isomorphic in complex dimensions ≥  3, whereas in dimension 2 there exists a surjective homomorphism π1(∂D)  →  π1(D) and the fundamental group of ∂D can be larger than that of D (see [\cite=NS] for a detailed discussion of these facts). Indeed, as we observed above, π1(Dnt) = 0 for n  ≥  2, π1(Mnt) = 0 for n  ≥  3, but [formula]. Examples of simply connected (in fact contractible) domains with non-simply connected boundaries exist even in the class of strongly pseudoconvex domains in [formula] although they are much harder to construct (see [\cite=Go]).

We will now turn to the problem of the CR-embeddability of Mnt in [formula] and prove the following proposition.

Any real-analytic CR-embedding of Mnt into [formula] extends to a biholomorphic mapping of Dnt onto a domain in [formula].

Proof: Let [formula] be a real-analytic CR-embedding. Then φ extends to a biholomorphic map between a neighborhood of Mnt in Qn and a neighborhood of the real-analytic strongly pseudoconvex hypersurface M: = φ(Mnt) in [formula]. Further, φ extends to a holomorphic map from Dnt to [formula] (which follows, for instance, from results of [\cite=KR]), and we denote the extension of φ to a neighborhood of [formula] also by φ.

Next, let D be the strongly pseudoconvex domain in [formula] bounded by M and ψ:M  →  Mnt the inverse of φ on Mnt. As before, the map ψ extends to a biholomorphic map between a neighborhood of M in [formula] and a neighborhood of Mnt in Qn. Furthermore, ψ extends to a holomorphic map from D to [formula]. We denote the resulting extension of ψ to a neighborhood of [formula] also by ψ. Clearly, the range of ψ lies in Qn.

It now follows that φ(Dnt) = D, ψ(D) = Dnt and φ, ψ are the inverses of each other. In particular, φ maps Dnt biholomorphically onto D, which completes the proof. [formula]

As an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=induced] we obtain the following result.

If for some t > 1 the manifold Mnt is real-analytically CR-embeddable in [formula], then Sn admits a real-analytic totally real embedding in [formula].

It is not hard to see that for n  ≠  3,7 the sphere Sn does not admit a smooth totally real embedding in [formula] (see [\cite=Gr2], [\cite=SZ]). Indeed, multiplication by i establishes an isomorphism between the tangent and the normal bundles of any smooth totally real n-dimensional submanifold of [formula]. On the other hand, the normal bundle to Sn induced by any smooth embedding in [formula] is trivial (see Theorem 8.2 in [\cite=K]). Therefore, if Sn admits a smooth totally real embedding in [formula], it is parallelizable, which is impossible unless n = 3 or n = 7. Corollary [\ref=cor] then yields that Mnt cannot be real-analytically CR-embedded in [formula] for n  ≠  3,7. This last statement was obtained in [\cite=MN] by utilizing the facts that Mnt is diffeomorphic to the sphere bundle over Sn and that a real-analytic embedding of Mnt into [formula] induces a smooth embedding of the tangent bundle of Sn into [formula], which again leads to the parallelizability of Sn (at least for n  ≥  3).

Further, the non-existence of a smooth totally real embedding of S7 in [formula] was first obtained in [\cite=SZ] by an argument relying on a result of [\cite=S], which states that any two smooth embeddings of Sn in [formula] are regularly homotopic. Corollary [\ref=cor] then yields:

No manifold in the family M7t admits a real-analytic CR-embedding in  [formula], hence every homogeneous compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurface in [formula] is CR-equivalent to S13.

In contrast, it turns out that S3 can be embedded into [formula] by a real-analytic CR-map. The first proof of this fact was given in [\cite=AR], where an explicit example of an embedding was constructed. Since S3 is a totally real submanifold of Q3, any real-analytic totally real embedding of S3 into [formula] extends to a biholomorphic map defined in a neighborhood of S3 in Q3. The manifolds M3t accumulate to S3 as t  →  1, hence M3t admits a real-analytic CR-embedding in [formula] for all t sufficiently close to 1. This shows that, interestingly, the classification of homogeneous compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurfaces in [formula] includes manifolds other than S5. The embedding found in [\cite=AR] is a polynomial map on [formula], hence it has a (unique) holomorphic continuation to all of [formula]. We will study this extended map in the next section.

Observe that every hypersurface Mnt is non-spherical. Indeed, otherwise by results of [\cite=NS] the universal cover of the domain Dnt would be biholomorphic to the unit ball [formula]. Since Dnt is simply-connected, this would imply that Dnt is biholomorphic to Bn, which is impossible since Dnt is not contractible. Now, the non-sphericity and homogeneity of the hypersurface Mnt yield that it has no umbilic points. Therefore, every manifold M3t embeddable in [formula] provides an example of a compact strongly pseudoconvex simply-connected hypersurface in [formula] without umbilic points. Such hypersurfaces have been known before, but the arguments required to obtain non-umbilicity for them are much more involved than the one given above. For example, the proof in [\cite=W] of the fact that every generic ellipsoid in [formula] for n  ≥  3 has no umbilic points relies on the Chern-Moser theory (note for comparison that every ellipsoid in [formula] has at least four umbilic points - see [\cite=HJ]).

The holomorphic continuation of the Ahern-Rudin map

In this section we study the holomorphic continuation of the totally real embedding of S3 into [formula] constructed in [\cite=AR]. Let (z,w) be coordinates in [formula] and let S3 be realized in the standard way as the subset of [formula] given by

[formula]

The Ahern-Rudin map is defined on all of [formula] as follows:

[formula]

Now, consider [formula] with coordinates z1,z2,z3,z4 and embed [formula] into [formula] as the totally real subspace [formula]:

[formula]

Clearly, the push-forward of the polynomial map f extends from [formula] to a holomorphic map [formula] by the formula

[formula]

It will be convenient for us to argue in the coordinates

[formula]

In these coordinates the quadric Q3 takes the form

[formula]

the sphere S3  ⊂  Q3 the form

[formula]

the hypersurface M3t  ⊂  Q3 the form

[formula]

and the map F the form

[formula]

We will study the map F in order to obtain some evidence regarding the values of t for which the manifold M3t is embeddable in [formula]. Clearly, F defines an embedding of M3t if its restriction : = F|Q3 is non-degenerate and injective on M3t, therefore it is important to investigate the non-degeneracy and injectivity properties of [formula]. First of all, observe that F has maximal rank at every point of Q3 since its Jacobian matrix is

[formula]

and the entries w3w24 + 2iw1w2w4, 2w2w3w4 + iw1w22 cannot simultaneously vanish on Q3. However, as the following proposition shows, most manifolds M3t contain points at which the restricted map [formula] degenerates.

The map [formula] degenerates at some point of M3t if and only if [formula].

Proof: Observe that |w1| + |w3| > 0 on Q3. For w1  ≠  0 we choose w1,w3,w4 as local coordinates on Q3 and write the third component of [formula] as

[formula]

(see ([\ref=qnew]), ([\ref=map])). Then the Jacobian [formula] of [formula] is equal to

[formula]

hence it vanishes if and only if

[formula]

At such points we have

[formula]

Analogously, if w3  ≠  0, we choose w1,w2,w3 as local coordinates on Q3 and write the third component of [formula] as

[formula]

(see ([\ref=qnew]), ([\ref=map])). Then

[formula]

which vanishes if and only if

[formula]

Hence for all points of degeneracy of [formula] we have w1  ≠  0, w3  ≠  0, and therefore such points are described as the zeroes of ∂φ  /  ∂w4 or, equivalently, as the zeroes of ∂ψ  /  ∂w2.

Now, investigating the behavior of the function

[formula]

for x,y > 0, one can deduce from ([\ref=est1]) that [formula] vanishes at a point of M3t if and only if [formula] as claimed. [formula]

As we noted above, any real-analytic totally real embedding of S3 in [formula] yields an embedding of M3t for all t sufficiently close to 1. Define

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=embed] implies [formula]. We will now give a lower bound for t0.

One has t0  ≥  1 + 10- 6.

Proof: For 0 < ε < 1 define

[formula]

Clearly, Uε is a neighborhood of S3 in Q3 (see ([\ref=sphereq])). We will find ε such that [formula] is biholomorphic on Uε. Writing any point in Q3 as

[formula]

from ([\ref=qnew]) we observe

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Clearly, W lies in Uε if and only if |μ| < ε, |η| < ε. It then follows from ([\ref=formm7]), ([\ref=formm8]) that M3t  ⊂  Uε for all 1 < t < 1 + ε2 / 2. Below we will see that one can take [formula], which will then imply the theorem.

In order to choose ε, we study the fibers of the map [formula]. Let two points W = (w1,w2,w3,w4) and Ŵ = (ŵ1,ŵ2,ŵ3,ŵ4) lie in Q3 and assume that (W) = (Ŵ). Then from ([\ref=map]) one immediately has ŵ1 = w1, ŵ3 = w3 and

[formula]

If w1 = 0 or w3 = 0, then ([\ref=mainids]) implies Ŵ = W, so we suppose from now on that w1  ≠  0 and w3  ≠  0. Then, using ([\ref=qnew]) we substitute

[formula]

into ([\ref=mainids]) and simplifying the resulting expression obtain

[formula]

We treat identity ([\ref=mainids4]) as an equation with respect to ŵ4. The solution ŵ4 = w4 leads to the point W (see ([\ref=expr234])). Further, the quadratic equation

[formula]

has the following solutions:

[formula]

Our goal now is to choose ε so that for W∈Uε neither of the points Ŵ defined by solutions ([\ref=solquadr]) lies in Uε. We write w2  =  1  +  μ, w4  =  3  +  η, ŵ4  =  3  +   and show that ε can be taken so that if |μ| < ε, |η| < ε, then ||  ≥  ε.

Formula ([\ref=solquadr]) implies

[formula]

Observe that for any w3 one has

[formula]

Next, since ε < 1, formula ([\ref=formmm18]) yields

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Using ([\ref=est4]), one can estimate the terms in square brackets in the left-hand side of ([\ref=mainids1]) as follows:

[formula]

Similarly, using ([\ref=est4]) for the right-hand side of ([\ref=mainids1]) we have

[formula]

It follows from formulas ([\ref=mainids1]), ([\ref=cond1]), ([\ref=cond2]), ([\ref=cond3]) that

[formula]

Thus, in order to finalize the proof of the theorem, we need to choose ε so that inequality ([\ref=ineq]) implies ||  ≥  ε. For example, let ε be such that

[formula]

For instance, [formula] satisfies this condition. Then from ([\ref=ineq]) one has

[formula]

which implies || > 0.003 > ε as required. The proof of the theorem is complete. [formula]

By experimenting with inequality ([\ref=ineq]) one can slightly improve the value of ε. However, the improved value is still of order 10- 3, thus the lower bound for t0 - 1 it leads to is still of order 10- 6.

We finish the paper by making several observations regarding solutions ([\ref=solquadr]) of equation ([\ref=qudreq]) concentrating on the case when W∈M3t for some [formula].

(i) It follows from ([\ref=phieq]) that w4 is a solution of ([\ref=qudreq]) if and only if [formula] vanishes at the point W. Therefore, by Proposition [\ref=embed], neither of the values in the right-hand side of ([\ref=solquadr]) is equal to w4 if W∈M3t with [formula].

(ii) Arguing as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=embed], one can see that the polynomial 6iw23w24 - (2 + 6i)w3w4 + 1 vanishes at some point of M3t if and only if [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that the right-hand side of ([\ref=solquadr]) defines two distinct points Ŵ1, Ŵ2 if W∈M3t with [formula]. Combining this fact with (i), we see that for such W the fiber of [formula] over (W) consists of exactly three points.

(iii) Using formula ([\ref=solquadr]) one can determine, in principle, all values [formula] such that neither of Ŵ1, Ŵ2 lies in M3t provided W∈M3t, which is equivalent to the injectivity of the map [formula] on M3t. However, the computations required for this analysis are rather complicated, and we did not carry them out in full generality. These computations significantly simplify if, for instance, w4 = 0. In this case formula ([\ref=solquadr]) yields the solutions

[formula]

Also, we have

[formula]

which implies |w3| < |w1| since otherwise [formula]. Therefore, for each of the two points Ŵ1, Ŵ2 given by ([\ref=twoptsspecial]) one has

[formula]

hence neither of these points lies in M3t. We also arrived at the same conclusion when analyzing several other special cases. Thus, our calculations lead to the following conjecture.

The restriction of [formula] to M3t is an embedding for all parameter values [formula].

(iv) We note that the non-injectivity of [formula] on M3t is easy to see, for example, if [formula]. Indeed, let u  ≠  0 be a real number satisfying

[formula]

and consider the following three distinct points in Q3:

[formula]

Then Wu,Wu',Wu''∈M3t and (Wu) = (Wu') = (Wu'') = (u,u,0). Since every fiber of [formula] contains at most three points, Wu,Wu',Wu'' form the complete fiber of [formula] over the point (u,u,0).

(v) In [\cite=AR] the authors in fact introduced not just the map f (see ([\ref=mapf])) but a class of maps of the form

[formula]

Here P is a harmonic polynomial given by

[formula]

where Qj is a homogeneous harmonic complex-valued polynomial on [formula] of total degree pj  ≥  1 in z,w and total degree qj in [formula], [formula], such that the sum [formula] does not vanish on S3. Observe that although the third component of the map f is not harmonic, it is obtained (up to a multiple) from the harmonic polynomial w2 - z2 + i by replacing the term i with i(|z|2 + |w|2) (these two expressions coincide on S3). It is convenient to take Q to be a polynomial in |z|2, |w|2 (as was done in [\cite=AR]), but in this case P is divisible by [formula], which implies that the holomorphic extension G of the push-forward of g to [formula] is not injective on M3t with [formula]. Indeed, writing G in the coordinates wj defined in ([\ref=coordw]), for the points Wu, Wu' introduced in ([\ref=threepoints]) one has G(Wu) = G(Wu') = (u,u,0). Thus, one cannot obtain the embeddability of M3t in [formula] for [formula] by utilizing any of the maps introduced in [\cite=AR] with Q being a function of |z|2, |w|2 alone.
