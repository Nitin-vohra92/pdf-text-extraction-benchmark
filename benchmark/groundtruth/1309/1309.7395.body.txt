Introduction

In a recent work, Fowler and Pisanski [\cite=FP1] [\cite=FP2] introduced the notion of the HL-index of a graph that is related to the HOMO-LUMO separation studied in theoretical chemistry (see also Jakli c, Fowler, and Pisanski [\cite=FJP]). This is the gap between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO). In the Hückel model [\cite=GuPol], the energies of these orbitals are in linear relationship with eigenvalues of the corresponding molecular graph and can be expressed as follows. Let G be a graph of order n, and let [formula] be the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. The eigenvalues occurring in the HOMO-LUMO separation are the median eigenvalues λh(G) and [formula], where

[formula]

The HL-index R(G) of the graph G is then defined as

[formula]

A simple unweighted graph G is said to be subcubic if its maximum degree is at most 3. In [\cite=FP1] [\cite=FP2] it is proved that every subcubic graph G satisfies 0  ≤  R(G)  ≤  3 and that if G is bipartite, then [formula]. The following is the main result from [\cite=Moh].

The median eigenvalues λh(G) and [formula] of every subcubic graph G are contained in the interval

[formula]

This result is best possible since the Heawood graph (the bipartite incidence graph of points and lines of the Fano plane) has [formula].

The following conjecture was proposed in [\cite=Moh].

If G is a planar subcubic graph, then [formula].

The conjecture has been verified for planar bipartite graphs in [\cite=Moh2]. In this paper we prove a surprising extension of [\cite=Moh2] and of Conjecture [\ref=conj:planar] that holds for all bipartite subcubic graphs with a single exception of the Heawood graph (or disjoint union of copies of it). The following are our main results.

Let G be a bipartite subcubic graph. If every connected component of G is isomorphic to the Heawood graph, then [formula]. In any other case, the median eigenvalues λh(G) and [formula] are contained in the interval

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:cubic_bipartite] shows that the median eigenvalues λh and [formula] are small, but our proof can be tweaked to give much more - a positive fraction of (median) eigenvalues lie in the interval

Interlacing and imbalance of partitions

Let us first recall that eigenvalues of bipartite graphs are symmetric with respect to 0, i.e., if λ is an eigenvalue, then -  λ is an eigenvalue as well and has the same multiplicity as λ. This in particular implies that [formula] and that [formula]. Therefore, it suffices to consider λh.

Let us next recall the eigenvalue interlacing theorem (cf., e.g., [\cite=GR]) that will be our main tool in the sequel.

Let A  ⊂  V(G) be a vertex set of cardinality k, and let K = G - A. Then for every [formula], we have

[formula]

If [formula] is a partition of the vertices of G, we denote by G(B) = G - A the subgraph of G induced on B. In the sequel we will consider vertex partitions [formula], but the two parts A,B will play different roles. Thus, we shall consider such a partition as an ordered pair (A,B). Given a partition (A,B) of V(G), let [formula] be the smallest integer such that [formula], and let [formula]. Then we say that the partition (A,B) is (s,t)-imbalanced, and we define the imbalance of the partition (A,B) as

[formula]

Suppose that (A,B) is an (s,t)-imbalanced vertex partition of a subcubic graph G. If r = imb(A,B) - 1, then [formula]. In particular, if imb(A,B) > 0, then [formula].

Conditions of the lemma give that [formula] and

[formula]

If n = |A| + |B| is even, then [formula]. If n is odd, then [formula]. In each case,

[formula]

Since G(B) = G - A is obtained from G by deleting |A| vertices and |A| + s  ≤  h, the eigenvalue interlacing theorem shows that λh - r(G)  =  λ|A| + s(G)  ≤  λs(G(B))  ≤  1.

Let (A,B) be a partition of V(G). Suppose that C  ⊆  A is a set of vertices in A. We say that C increases imbalance of (A,B) if [formula]. The following result will be our main tool for finding imbalance-increasing vertex-sets.

Suppose that (A,B) is a partition of V(G) and C  ⊆  A. Let Q be the union of those connected components of [formula] that contain vertices in C. If [formula], then C increases imbalance of (A,B).

Let (A,B) be (s,t)-imbalanced. Let k = |C| and [formula]. Then [formula]. Note that G(B) and G(B') have the same connected components except for those contained in Q. Since λk(Q)  ≤  1 and λs(G(B))  ≤  1, we have that [formula]. Thus (A',B') is (s',t')-imbalanced, where s'  ≤  s + k - 1. Hence, imb(A',B')  ≥  (t + k)  -  (s + k - 1)  +  1  =  imb(A,B)  +  1.

For C  ⊆  V(G), let N(C) denote the set of all vertices in [formula] that have a neighbor in C. The statement of Lemma [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance] has a converse under a mild restriction on N(C).

Suppose that (A,B) is a partition of V(G) and C  ⊆  A. If N(C)  ⊆  B and every vertex in N(C) has all its neighbors in A, then C increases imbalance of (A,B) if and only if [formula], where [formula].

Let us first observe that the independence of N(C) in G(B) implies that the subgraph Q that appears in Lemma [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance] is equal to [formula]. Therefore, it remains to prove only the direction converse to the one of the previous lemma, i.e., that the increased imbalance implies that [formula].

Let us adopt the notation used in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance] and let s' be the smallest integer such that [formula]. Let us assume that imb(A',B')  =  t' - s' + 1  >  imb(A,B)  =  t - s + 1. Since t' = t + k, it suffices to see that s' = s + k - 1. However, this is an easy observation since G(B) and G(B') have the same eigenvalues apart from the eigenvalues of Q in G(B') that are replaced by |N(C)| eigenvalues, all equal to 0, in G(B).

Suppose now that G is a bipartite graph and that (A,B) is its bipartition. A set U of vertices of G is A-thick ( B-thick) in G if every vertex in [formula] (resp. [formula]) has at most one neighbor in [formula], every vertex in [formula] (resp. [formula]) has at most one neighbor in U, and [formula] (resp. [formula]). The set U is thick if it is either A-thick or B-thick.

If U is an A-thick set of vertices in G, then the set [formula] increases imbalance of the bipartition (A,B).

Consider the subgraph Q of [formula] consisting of those connected components that contain vertices in C, and let [formula]. Thickness condition implies that after removing vertices in [formula] from Q, we are left with a graph consisting of a matching and isolated vertices, so its eigenvalues are all in the interval

[formula]

Improving imbalance

In this section we prove that for every vertex v0 of a connected bipartite subcubic graph G with bipartition (A,B), if G is not isomorphic to the Heawood graph, then a small neighborhood around v0 contains a set C that can be used to increase imbalance of the partition (A,B) or (B,A). From now on we assume that G is bipartite and (A,B) is the bipartition of G.

Given a graph G and its vertex v, we denote by Br(v) the set of all vertices of G whose distance from v is at most r. We will sometimes consider the set Br(v) as the subgraph of G induced on this vertex set.

Suppose that (A,B) is the bipartition of a bipartite subcubic graph G, v0∈V(G), and the connected component of G containing v0 is not isomorphic to the Heawood graph. Then B17(v0) contains a set C of vertices such that either C  ⊆  A and C increases imbalance of (A,B), or C  ⊆  B and C increases imbalance of (B,A).

Before giving the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:improve_imbalance], let us show how the lemma implies our main results, Theorems [\ref=thm:cubic_bipartite] and [\ref=thm:cubic_bipartite_linearly_many].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:cubic_bipartite] follows from the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:cubic_bipartite_linearly_many] given below by taking V0  =  {v0}, where v0 is an arbitrary vertex of G. Thus we only need to take care of Theorem [\ref=thm:cubic_bipartite_linearly_many].

Let G be a bipartite subcubic graph with no component isomorphic to the Heawood graph. For each vertex v of G, we have |Br(v)| < 3  ·  2r. Therefore, G contains a set V0 of vertices that are mutually at distance at least 38 and |V0| > εn, where ε = 2- 40. Let us consider the bipartition (A,B) of G, and let, for each v∈V0, Cv be the vertex set C obtained by applying Lemma [\ref=lem:improve_imbalance]. Let a denote the number of vertices v∈V0 such that Cv  ⊆  A, and let b = |V0| - a be the number of cases where Cv  ⊆  B.

Note that λ1(G(A)) = λ1(G(B)) = 0. Thus,

[formula]

Let (A',B') be the partition obtained from (A,B) by removing from A and adding into B all sets Cv (v∈V0) for which Cv  ⊆  A. Since every Cv is contained in B17(v), all these sets are pairwise at distance at least 4 from each other. Consequently, their graphs Q = QCv are pairwise disjoint and non-adjacent. Hence, each of these sets increases imbalance of (A,B) by at least 1 (Lemma [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance_converse]). Therefore,

[formula]

Similarly, adding to A all sets Cv (v∈V0) for which Cv  ⊆  B, we obtain a partition (B'',A'') such that

[formula]

Finally, all three inequalities ([\ref=eq:pf1])-([\ref=eq:pf3]) imply that

[formula]

By symmetry, we may assume that imb(A',B')  ≥  imb(B'',A''). Then ([\ref=eq:pf4]) implies that [formula], and Lemma [\ref=lem:k-unbalanced] gives the claim of the theorem with [formula].

The family C0 of graphs listed in the appendix (Figures [\ref=fig:appendix1]-[\ref=fig:appendix3]) has the following property: If H∈C0 and C is the bipartite set of its vertices that are shown as full circles or full squares in Figures [\ref=fig:appendix1]-[\ref=fig:appendix3], then [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance_converse] shows that the following is the common outcome for all of these graphs:

Suppose that H∈C0 is one of the graphs depicted in Figures [\ref=fig:appendix1]-[\ref=fig:appendix3]. Let C be the bipartite class of its vertices that are drawn as full circles or full squares. If a bipartite subcubic graph G with bipartition (A,B) contains H as an induced subgraph, where C  ⊆  A, and every vertex in C has all its neighbors in H, then C increases imbalance of the bipartition (A,B) of G.

The proof is clear by observing that the component Q in [formula] containing C is equal to H and by the remarks given in the paragraph before the corollary.

We shall need some new concepts. Let [formula] be an integer. We say that vertices x and y of G are k-adjacent in G if there is a path of length k joining them. If H is a subgraph of G, a k-chord of H in G is a path [formula] of length k, such that [formula]. Having such a k-chord P, we say that v0 and vk are k-adjacent outside H. The subgraph H is k-induced in G if it has no l-chords for [formula]. Note that the special case when k = 1 gives the usual notions of being adjacent, a chord, or an induced subgraph.

When dealing with vertices of degree 2 in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:improve_imbalance], we will need the following result.

Let G be a bipartite graph of girth at least 6, let v0∈V(G), and let r be a positive integer. If x,y∈Br(v0), then there exists a 2-induced path from x to y that is contained in Br + 1(v0).

For u,v∈V(G), we will denote by d(u,v) the distance in G from u to v. Let Px and Py be shortest paths from x and from y to v0, respectively. Choose these paths so that their intersection is a path Q, and Q is as long as possible. Since G has no cycles of length 4, both paths Px and Py are 2-induced. Let z be the first vertex of intersection of Px and Py when traversing the paths in the direction towards v0. Then Q is a path from z to v0. The path Pxy consisting of the segments of Px from x to z and of Py from z to y has length l = d(x,v0) + d(y,v0) - 2d(z,v0). First, we claim that Pxy is an induced path. Namely, the segments of the two paths are induced, so if there were a chord uv of Pxy, then [formula] and [formula]. Since G is bipartite, we have d(u,z)  ≠  d(v,z), and it is easy to see that this contradicts our choice of the paths with Q being longest possible since we could replace one of the paths by a path using the edge uv and thus increasing the intersection of the two paths.

If Px,y is not 2-induced, let uwv be a 2-chord, where [formula] and [formula]. Let us choose the 2-chord such that d(u,z) is maximum possible. As before, the maximality of Q shows that d(u,z)  =  d(v,z). Let Pxy' be the path from x to y obtained from Pxy by using the 2-chord uwv instead of the path from u to v in Pxy. It is clear from our choices that any chords or 2-chords of Pxy' must use the vertex w. However, since G has no 4-cycles, any such chord or 2-chord would give a contradiction to the maximality property of Q. Therefore, Pxy' is 2-induced.

The conclusion from the above paragraph is that either Pxy is 2-induced, or Pxy' exists and is 2-induced. In each case we obtain the statement of the proposition.

In the proof, we do not intend to optimize the distance from v0 in which we are able to find a set that increases imbalance. Our main aim is to keep the proof simple.

Suppose that G and its vertex v0 give a counterexample to the theorem. We may assume that G is connected. As before, we assume that (A,B) is the bipartition of G. We shall proceed through a sequence of claims, concerning vertices in vicinity of v0. In each claim we will assume that the claim is false and then define certain vertex set C (where C  ⊆  A or C  ⊆  B). We let [formula]. Observe that QC is the subgraph Q that appears in Lemmas [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance] and [\ref=lem:increase_imbalance_converse] about increasing imbalance.

Claim 1: Each vertex in B17(v0) has degree at least 2. If v has degree at most 1, then C = {v} increases imbalance since [formula] and [formula].

Claim 2: B16(v0) contains no 4-cycles. Suppose that D = v1v2v3v4 is a 4-cycle in B16(v0). For [formula], let ui be the neighbor of vi that is not in V(D) (if deg (vi) = 2, then we set ui = vi). If u1  ≠  u3, then let C = {v1,v3}. We may assume that C  ⊆  A. Clearly, [formula] is isomorphic to the graph C+4 depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1] (or to an induced subgraph of C+4 if u1 = v1 or u3 = v3). Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] shows that C increases imbalance of (A,B). Similarly, if u2  ≠  u4, we may take C = {v2,v4} and C increases imbalance of (B,A). Finally, assume that u1 = u3 and u2 = u4. Let us now consider the 4-cycle v1v2v3u1. Again, if u1 and v2 have no common neighbor outside this cycle, we are done by taking C = {u1,v2}. (Note that C  ⊆  B17(v0) since V(D)  ⊆  B16(v0).) If they have such a common neighbor, this must be u2, and hence G = K3,3. In this case, C = {v1,v3,u2} increases imbalance.

Claim 3: If B13(v0) contains a vertex of degree 2, then B16(v0) contains precisely two vertices of degree 2 and they are adjacent to each other. Let us first prove that B16(v0) contains at most two vertices of degree 2, and if there are two, one of them is in A and the other one is in B. To see this, suppose that [formula] have degree 2 and u  ≠  v. By Proposition [\ref=prop:path_in_the_ball], there exists a 2-induced path P from u to v in B17(v0). Let [formula]. Since P is 2-induced and u,v have degree 2, the graph QC is isomorphic to the graph P̂2t + 1 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1], where the horizontal path shown at the bottom of the drawing is P and 2t is its length. Since P  ⊆  B17(v0), Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] completes the proof.

Suppose now that deg (v) = 2, where v∈B13(v0). Suppose first that v does not belong to a cycle of length 6. Let v1,v1' be the neighbors of v, and let v2 (v2') be a neighbor of v1 (v1') that is different from v. Finally, let C  =  {v,v2,v2'}  ⊂  B15(v0). Let Q = QC. We claim that Q is isomorphic to the graph P̂-7 depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1] (since deg (v2) =  deg (v2') = 3). To see this, we have to prove that vertices in [formula] are distinct and non-adjacent, apart from their adjacencies in P-7. Clearly, v is at distance at most 3 from all vertices in Q. If two of them were adjacent or the same (apart from adjacencies in P-7), then we would obtain a cycle of length at most 7 containing v. Since G is bipartite and v does not belong to a cycle of length 4 or 6, this is not possible. This proves the claim. Now, we are done by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

Finally, let R = vv1v2v3v4v5 be a 6-cycle containing v. As shown above, we may assume that deg (v2)  =   deg (v4)  =  3. By symmetry, we may also assume that deg (v1) = 3. It suffices to prove that deg (v5) = 2. Suppose for a contradiction that deg (v5) = 3. For i∈{1,2,4,5}, let ui be the neighbor of vi that is not in V(R). In the preceding paragraph we proved that taking the set C  =  {v,v2,v4} gives the outcome of the theorem unless v2 and v4 are 2-adjacent (which in turn gave rise to the 6-cycle R). The same argument can be repeated on the sets {v,v2,u5}, {v,u1,v4}, and {v,u1,u5}. They show that u2 is the common neighbor of v2 and u5, u4 is the common neighbor of u1 and v4, and that u1 and u5 have a common neighbor [formula]. (Here we used the fact that there are no 4-cycles in B16(v0) and that all treated vertices are in B16(v0).) If the subgraph S of G induced on the vertex set [formula] is 2-induced, then it is thick and we are done by Lemma [\ref=lem:thick_unbalanced]. Therefore, two of its vertices are 2-adjacent. The only pairs that could be 2-adjacent outside S without creating a 4-cycle are u2,u4 and v3,w. Both of these give isomorphic outcomes since v3 and w would have played the role of u2 and u4 if taking the 6-cycle vv1v2u2u5v5v instead of R. Thus, we may assume that u2zu4 is a 2-chord. Let C  =  {v,v2,v4,u1,u5,z}. Observe that C  ⊂  B15(v0) since a neighbor of v belongs to B12(v0). Then [formula] is isomorphic to the graph Ĉ6 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1]. Thus, we obtain the outcome of the theorem by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix]. This completes the proof of Claim 3.

Claim 3A. If [formula] and [formula] are adjacent degree-2 vertices of G, then they are contained in a 6-cycle [formula] and there are vertices u1,u4∉V(R) such that [formula] is also a 6-cycle in G. We shall use the notation used in the last part of the proof of Claim 3, except that we now assume that z1 = v and z2 = v5 both have degree 2. Considering the set C  =  {z1,u1,v4}, we conclude that u1 is adjacent to u4. This gives rise to R'. Since a neighbor of z1 belongs to B12(v0), we conclude that [formula].

An induced 2t-cycle [formula] in G, in which either no two vertices in the set [formula] are 2-adjacent outside D, or no two vertices in the set [formula] are 2-adjacent outside D, is called a good 2t-cycle.

Claim 4. B17(v0) contains neither good 8-cycles nor good 12-cycles. Suppose not. Let C and C' be the vertex sets of a good 8- or 12-cycle from the definition of good cycles. It follows that either QC or QC' is isomorphic to the graph C+8 or C+12 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1] (if some of the vertices on the cycle were of degree 2, QC or QC' could be subgraph of one of these missing some of the degree-1 vertices). By Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix], C or C' increases imbalance of either (A,B) or (B,A). This proves the claim.

Since B16(v0) has no 4-cycles, every 8-cycle in B16(v0) is induced. By using Claim 4, it is easy to see that every 8-cycle can be written as [formula], where v1 and v5 are 2-adjacent, and v2 and v6 are 2-adjacent. We shall denote such a subgraph by H0 (see Figure [\ref=fig:H_0]), and we shall later prove that every copy of H0 in a vicinity of v0 is 2-induced in G (see Claim 8). Prior to that, we need some further properties.

Claim 5. Every vertex in B12(v0) is contained in a cycle of length 6. Suppose v is not contained in a 6-cycle. Since v∈B12(v0), Claims 3 and 3A imply Claim 5 for vertices of degree 2 and their neighbors. Therefore, we may assume that v and its neighbors are of degree 3. Let C be the set consisting of v and the six vertices that are at distance 2 from v. Then QC is isomorphic to the tree B3 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1] (or its induced subgraph with some of the leaves missing). By Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix], C increases imbalance of either (A,B) or (B,A).

We say that an edge of G is internal if it is contained in a 6-cycle in G, and is external, otherwise. Claim 5 implies that the set of external edges in the vicinity of v0 form a matching in G. By the remarks stated after Claim 4, every 8-cycle in B17(v0) is contained in a copy of the graph H0, which can be written as the union of three 6-cycles. This implies that every edge in the 8-cycle is internal. Thus, external edges cannot belong to cycles of length less than 10. This fact will be used repeatedly in the proof of the next claim which shows that every 6-cycle is incident with at most one external edge.

Claim 6. Every 6-cycle in B11(v0) is incident with at most one external edge. Let [formula] be a 6-cycle with two or more external edges. For [formula], let ei = viui be the edge incident with vi that is not on the cycle D. (We set ei = vi if deg (vi) = 2, and we say that ei is internal in such a case.) Since [formula], Claim 5 shows that there is a 6-cycle Di through ui. If ei is external, the two 6-cycles D and Di induce a subgraph Hi of G that has only the edge ei in addition to the two cycles. If there were other adjacencies between D and Di, then ei would be contained in a cycle of length less than 10 (and would also be contained in B15(v0)), which is excluded as argued above. The same argument shows that Hi is 2-induced.

We may assume that e1 is external, and we shall distinguish three cases, depending on whether ej, j = 2,3,4, is another external edge. Let H1j be the subgraph of G induced on [formula]. Figure [\ref=fig:external_edges] shows graphs [formula] for j = 2,3,4. Let us first observe that all vertices shown in Figure [\ref=fig:external_edges] are distinct in each of the three cases since any identification would give a cycle of length at most 8 through e1. (This is clear for H12; similarly in H13 and H14 where we have to observe that possible identification of x and s in H13 or identification of x and t in H14 - or cases symmetric to these - would force another identification of a neighbor of x and thus yielding a cycle of length at most 8 containing e1.) Let C be the set of vertices of H1j that are depicted as black vertices in Figure [\ref=fig:external_edges]. Since D  ⊆  B11(v0), we have that C  ⊆  B15(v0).

Let us first suppose that two of the vertices in C have a common neighbor outside C. The only possibilities (up to symmetries) that do not yield a cycle of length at most 8 through e1 are the following:

s and y in H12: In this case, there is a good 12-cycle in B16(v0) using the 2-chord from s to y, the path from y to e2 that passes through x, and the path from e2 to s.

s and x in H13: This case gives a good 12-cycle in B16(v0).

s and z in H13: This case also gives a good 12-cycle (by using the path v3v4v5v6v1 through D) since any 2-adjacency of white vertices on that 12-cycle would yield a short cycle through e1 or through e3.

s and y or u and y in H14: Both cases give a good 12-cycle.

Thus we may assume that there are no additional 2-adjacencies between vertices in C. If H1j is as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:external_edges], i.e., the subgraph shown is induced in G, the subgraph QC is isomorphic to one of the graphs Ĥ12, Ĥ13, and Ĥ14, shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix2] in the appendix (with possibly some degree-1 vertices missing if H1j contains vertices whose degree in G is 2). By Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix], C increases imbalance. Thus, we may assume that H1j is not induced. The only possibilities for additional edges (up to symmetries) that do not yield a cycle of length at most 8 through e1 are the following:

The edge sx in H12: In this case, QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ12' from the appendix (Figure [\ref=fig:appendix2]), and we are done by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

The edge sy in H13 or the edge ty in H14: Each of these cases gives rise to a good 12-cycle (using the path through the vertex x).

The edge sx in H14: This case also gives a good 12-cycle.

The edge sz in H14: In this case, QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ12' shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix2] (where D can be any of the bottom two hexagons), and we are done by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

This completes the proof of Claim 6.

Claim 7. Let [formula]. If every vertex at distance at most 2 from v has degree 3, then G contains an 8-cycle that has a vertex at distance at most 2 from v. Let [formula] be a 6-cycle that contains v. By Claim 3A, all vertices in D and all vertices adjacent to D have degree 3. Let ei = viui be the edge incident with vi that is not contained in D. By Claim 6, at least five of the edges [formula] are internal. Each 6-cycle D' containing ei must use another internal edge ej. If j = i + 2 or j = i - 2 (values modulo 6), then [formula] contains an 8-cycle, where v is either on the cycle or adjacent to it. Suppose now that j = i + 3. We may assume that i = 1 and j = 4 and that [formula]. Since any two vertices in [formula] lie on a common 6-cycle, at most one of these vertices is incident with an external edge. We may assume that this vertex, if it exits, is v6'. Note that all vertices in [formula] have degree 3. Define the edges e5',e6'∉E(D') that are incident with v5' and v6', respectively. If a 6-cycle D'' through e2 uses any of the edges e5,e6,e5',e6', then the union [formula] contains an 8-cycle that is at distance at most 2 from v. By symmetry, a similar conclusion holds for all other internal edges leaving [formula]. Thus, we may assume that the 6-cycle through e2 returns through e3, the cycle through e5 returns through e6, and the 6-cycle leaving v5' returns through v6'. Denote these 6-cycles by F23,F56,F56', respectively. Note that any two of these 6-cycles together with a 6-cycle in [formula] form a subgraph of G that is isomorphic to the graph L3 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:hexagons_through_internal_edges]. It is easy to see that if L3 is not 2-induced, then it contains an 8-cycle that passes through one of the vertices marked x and y in Figure [\ref=fig:hexagons_through_internal_edges]. Since x and y are at distance at most 2 from v, we get the claim. Thus, we may assume that each of these subgraphs is 2-induced, which implies that also the graph L3,3 (see Figure [\ref=fig:hexagons_through_internal_edges]) consisting of [formula] together with F23,F56,F56' is 2-induced in G. Let [formula] and note that C  ⊆  B16(v0). Since L3,3 is 2-induced in G, the subgraph QC is isomorphic to the graph L̂3,3 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix3], and we are done by applying Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

The last case to consider is when every 6-cycle using one of the edges ei returns to D either through ei - 1 or through ei + 1. Suppose first that a 6-cycle D1 through e1 and a 6-cycle D3 through e3 both return through e2. If the union [formula] is an A-thick (respectively B-thick) subgraph of G, then either [formula] (resp. [formula]) gives an imbalance-increasing vertex set in B16(v0) (see Lemma [\ref=lem:thick_unbalanced]). Therefore, either two vertices in A or two vertices in B are 2-adjacent. The corresponding 2-chord gives rise to two 6-cycles sharing a path of length 2 or 3, which is the case we have already treated above. Even though one of the 6-cycles D1 or D3 may play the role of D in this case, it is still true that a resulting 8-cycle is at distance at most 2 from v.

By symmetry, we may now assume that there are precisely three 6-cycles using internal edges [formula]. We may assume that the 6-cycles are F12,F34,F56, where Fij uses the edges ei and ej. If a vertex [formula] and a vertex [formula] are either the same, adjacent, or 2-adjacent in G, then we obtain two 6-cycles sharing a path of length 2 or 3, which is the case we have already treated above. In that case we get an imbalance-increasing set in B17(v0) or an 8-cycle at distance at most 2 from v. Since the same can be said for the other pairs of the 6-cycles Fij, we conclude that the graph [formula] is 2-induced in G. We set [formula] and observe that QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ123 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:6]. Again, Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] applies. This completes the proof of Claim 7.

Let H0 and H1 be the graphs depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:H_0], and let H2, H3, and H4 be the graphs in Figure [\ref=fig:H_2_and_H_3]. Observe that H2 and H3 are both isomorphic to the Heawood graph with one edge removed and that their subgraphs induced on vertices [formula] are isomorphic to H1.

Claim 8. Let D be an 8-cycle in B10(v0). Then D is contained in a 2-induced subgraph isomorphic to the graph H0. We have already seen that D must be contained in a subgraph H of G that is isomorphic to H0. This subgraph is induced in G since any chord in H0 gives rise to a cycle of length 4. It remains to see that H is 2-induced. We will use the notation provided in Figures [\ref=fig:H_0] and [\ref=fig:H_2_and_H_3], so the vertices of H and other graphs isomorphic to one of [formula] will be denoted by the integers [formula] as shown in the figures.

Suppose that H is not 2-induced. Note that any 2-chord starting at vertices 11 or 12 would give rise to a 4-cycle in G. Thus, we may assume, by symmetry, that we have a 2-chord 3-10-7. Since this 2-chord is part of another copy of H0, the subgraph obtained from H by adding the 2-chord is induced in G. By Lemma [\ref=lem:thick_unbalanced], this subgraph cannot be thick, so there is a 2-chord joining two of the vertices 4,8,10,12. The only two pairs not giving a 4-cycle are 4-8 and 10-12. They give rise to isomorphic graphs, so we may assume the 2-chord is 4-9-8. Thus we have a subgraph H' isomorphic to the graph H1 (shown in Figure [\ref=fig:H_0]). This subgraph is induced in G since any two vertices in different bipartite classes belong to a common copy of H0 inside H'.

Suppose first that H' is not 2-induced. By symmetry between the possible 2-adjacent pairs 9-11 and 10-12, we may assume that 10-13-12 is a 2-chord. By Lemma [\ref=lem:thick_unbalanced], two of the vertices 9,11,13 are 2-adjacent. If these are 9 and 11, we obtain a copy of H2. Otherwise, by symmetry, we have a 2-chord 9-14-13 which yields a copy of H3. Let x and y be the degree-2 vertices in the obtained subgraph. If they were adjacent, we would get the Heawood graph, so both graphs are isomorphic to the Heawood graph minus an edge, and thus we may assume henceforth that we have H2. By symmetry between x and y and by symmetry of the bipartite classes A and B, we may assume that x = 13∈A and that y = 14∈B. By Claim 3, x and y have degree 3 in G and there are two edges e = xx' and f = yy' going out of H2 in G. Since the distance in H2 between x and y is five, both e and f are external edges. Observe that either x' or y' belongs to B7(v0). This is clear if v0∈V(H2). Otherwise, one of these vertices is on a shortest path from v0 to D, giving the same outcome. We may assume that x'∈B7(v0). Let D'  ⊂  B10(v0) be a 6-cycle through the vertex x', and let [formula]. Then the subgraph QC of G is isomorphic to the graph [formula] shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1]. (To check this, note that the 8-cycle in the figure is 2-3-10-13-12-5-6-11-2, where the vertex 11 is adjacent to the vertex y = 14 having degree 1. The only non-obvious possibility for QC being different is that a vertex in D' would be equal to y' and hence adjacent to y. However, in that case, D' would be incident with two external edges e and f, contradicting Claim 6.) Now, Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] shows that C  ⊂  B11(v0) increases imbalance.

From now on, we may assume that H' is 2-induced. For vertices [formula], let ei be the edge in G incident with vertex i but not contained in H'. Note that for any [formula] of different parities, vertices i and j lie on a common 6-cycle in H'. Since [formula], we have H'  ⊂  B11(v0). By Claim 6, at most one of the edges e9,e10 is external. By symmetry, we may assume that e9 is internal. Since H' is 2-induced and the distance between 9 and 11 in H' is four, e9 and e11 cannot lie on a common 6-cycle. Thus, we may assume (by symmetry between e10 and e12) that a 6-cycle D' through e9 uses the edge e10. In that case, D' is the cycle 9-8-7-10-15-16-9, where 15 and 16 are new vertices. If a 6-cycle through e11 uses e10, then the cycle is 11-14-15-10-7-6-11 (14 being a new vertex). In this case we obtain a good 8-cycle 11-14-15-16-9-8-1-2-11. Similarly, if a 6-cycle through e12 uses e9. Since e11 and e12 are incident with the same 6-cycle, they cannot be both external by Claim 6. The only possibility for a 6-cycle (excluding previously treated cases) is the 6-cycle 12-13-14-11-6-5-12 (or 12-13-14-11-2-1-12) where 13 and 14 are new vertices. This gives us the graph H4 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:H_2_and_H_3]. The subgraph H4 is induced in G (or we get a case treated above). If it is not 2-induced, we may assume that we have the 2-chord 13-17-15, and in this case we obtain a good 8-cycle: 12-13-17-15-16-9-8-1-12. Therefore H4 is 2-induced. Now, we take [formula]. The subgraph QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ-4 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1]. Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] shows that C increases imbalance. This exhausts all possibilities and completes the proof of Claim 8.

We now define a vertex 0 as follows. If every vertex in B2(v0) is of degree 3 in G, then we take 0 = v0. Otherwise, Claim 3A shows that there exists a vertex 0∈B3(v0) such that all vertices at distance at most 2 from it have degree 3. Claim 7 shows that there exists an 8-cycle D at distance at most 2 from 0. By Claim 8, D is contained in a 2-induced subgraph H0 of G, where H0 is depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:H_0]. This gives the next conclusion.

Claim 9. There is a 2-induced subgraph of G isomorphic to H0 that contains a vertex in B4(v0).

We shall now fix the subgraph of Claim 9, call it H0 and denote its vertices by integers as in the figure.

Claim 10. All vertices in H0 have degree 3 in G, and for [formula], there is no t-chord joining a vertex in {3,4} with a vertex in {7,8}. By Claim 3, vertices 11 and 12 cannot be of degree 2. If another vertex, which we may assume is the vertex 3, is of degree 2, then let C = {1,3,5,7}. Since H0 is 2-induced, the corresponding subgraph QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ=0 from Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1], and we are done by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix]. This proves the first part of the claim.

Suppose next that there is a t-chord joining vertex 3 with {7,8}. By Claim 8, we have t  ≥  3. Now it is an easy task to verify that the t-chord together with a path in H0 gives rise to a good 8-cycle in G. This completes the proof of Claim 10.

If i is a vertex of degree 2 in H0, then we will denote by ei the edge in [formula] that is incident with the vertex i. If there is a 6-cycle that contains two of such edges, ei and ej, then we say that ei and ej are coupled. If the corresponding vertices i and j are at distance t in H0, then there is a (6 - t)-chord Pi,j of H0 containing ei and ej. Since H0 is 2-induced, we know that [formula] in such a case.

Claim 11. If e3 is coupled with e12, then the edge e4 is internal. Suppose that the path P3,12 is 3-13-14-12 (where 13 and 14 are new vertices) and suppose that e4 = 4a is an external edge. Since H0 has a vertex in B4(v0), the vertex a lies in B9(v0). By Claim 5, there is a 6-cycle R = abcdega through a. Since the edge 4a is external, it cannot be contained in a cycle of length less than 10 (see the comment stated before Claim 6). This implies that the cycle R is disjoint from [formula] and its only vertex that is incident to [formula] is a. Moreover, none of its vertices is 2-adjacent to a vertex in [formula], except possibly the vertex d that could be 2-adjacent to the vertex 8. Let C = {2,4,6,12,13,b,d,g}. Then QC is isomorphic to the graph N̂0 shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1]. Now the proof is complete by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

Claim 12. If e3 is coupled with e4 and P3,4 = 3abcd4, then the subgraph H5 induced on [formula] is either equal to [formula] or is equal to [formula] together with precisely one of the edges 11c or 12b. By Claim 10 and since G has no 4-cycles, the only possible edges of H5 in addition to the edges in [formula] are the two edges 11c and 12b. Thus it remains to see that both of them cannot be present. Suppose, for a contradiction, that they are. By Claim 6 and symmetry, we may assume that the edge ea leaving P3,4 at the vertex a is internal. It is easy to see that its supporting 6-cycle must return to [formula] through the vertex d. Let aefd be the corresponding 3-chord. Let C = {2,4,6,8,12,a,c,f}. By using Claim 10 it is easy to see that the corresponding subgraph QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ5 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix3], and we are done by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

Claim 13. If e3 is coupled with e4, then e7 is not coupled with e8. Suppose for a contradiction that e3 is coupled with e4 and that e7 is coupled with e8. Let us consider the graph [formula]. By Claims 10 and 12, this subgraph is isomorphic to the graph shown in Figure [\ref=fig:H_6], where each of the two dotted edges may or may not be present. If just one of these two edges is present, then we may assume that this is the edge incident with the vertex d. By Claim 10, the vertices a,b,c,d cannot be 2-adjacent outside this subgraph, except possibly for b and d. Let C  =  {2,4,6,8,12,a,b,c,d}. Then QC is either isomorphic to one of the graphs Ĥ06, Ĥ16, Ĥ26 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix3], or to a graph obtained from one of these graphs by identifying the neighbors of vertices b and d. The latter possibility does not happen if the left dotted edge in Figure [\ref=fig:H_6] is present. By the assumption made above, we may thus assume that b and d are not 2-adjacent when at least one of the dotted edges is present; thus the only additional case arising this way is the graph Ĥ*6 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix3]. In either case, we are done by Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix].

Claim 14. If e3 is coupled with e11, then e3 is coupled with e4. Let P3,11 be the 4-chord 3abc11. Since [formula] is not thick (Lemma [\ref=lem:thick_unbalanced]), there is a 2-chord joining two vertices in the larger bipartite class of this graph. By using Claim 10 it is easy to see that the only possibility is a 2-chord joining the vertex c with the vertex 4. This gives the claim.

We are now ready to complete the proof. We may assume that e3 is an internal edge, and we may assume that e3 is not coupled with e4 (by using Claim 13 and symmetry). By Claim 14, e3 is not coupled with e11 and by Claim 10, it is not coupled with e7 or e8. The only possibility remaining is that it is coupled with e12. Claim 11 implies that e4 is an internal edge. The same arguments as used for e3 show that e4 is coupled with e11. Now, Claim 10 implies that e7 and e8 cannot be coupled with e11 or e12. Therefore, e7 is coupled with e8. Take C to be the bipartite vertex class of [formula] containing the vertices 1, 3, 5, 7. Then QC is isomorphic to the graph Ĥ7 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix3]. Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] applies again, and the proof is complete.

Some subcubic graphs and their eigenvalues

In the appendix we list a collection of graphs and their critical eigenvalues that were used to obtain balance-increasing vertex sets in the proof of our main theorem.

(a) The graph C+4 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] has λ2(C+4)  =  1.

(b) Let G be one of the graphs C+6 or P̂-7 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1]. Then λ3(G)  =  1.

(c) The graph C+8 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] has λ4(C+8)  =  1.

(d) The graph C+12 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] has λ6(C+12)  =  1.

(e) The graph Ĉ6 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] has λ6(Ĉ6)  <  0.91  .

(f) The graph B3 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] has λ7(B3)  =  1.

(g) The graphs [formula] and Ĥ-4 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] have [formula].

(h) The graphs Ĥ=0, N̂0, and Ĥ5, depicted in Figs. [\ref=fig:appendix1] and [\ref=fig:appendix3] have λ4(Ĥ=0)  =  1, λ8(N̂0)  =  1, and λ8(Ĥ5)  <  0.92  .

(i) The graphs Ĥ12' and Ĥ123 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix2] satisfy λ8(Ĥ12')  =  λ9(Ĥ12')  =  λ8(Ĥ123)  =  λ9(Ĥ123)  =  1.

(j) The graphs Ĥ12, Ĥ13, and Ĥ14 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix2] have λ9(Ĥ12)  <  0.95, λ9(Ĥ13)  =  1, and λ9(Ĥ14)  <  0.96  .

(k) The graphs Ĥ*6, Ĥ06, Ĥ16, Ĥ26, and Ĥ7 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix3] have λ9(Ĥ*6)  =  λ9(Ĥ06)  =  λ9(Ĥ16)  =  λ9(Ĥ26)  =  λ8(Ĥ26)  =  λ9(Ĥ7)  =  1.

(l) The graph L̂3,3 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix3] has λ10(L̂3,3)  <  0.92  .

(m) The graph P̂2t + 1 depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:appendix1] with its horizontal path being of length 2t (t  ≥  0) has λt + 1(P̂2t + 1)  =  1.

Claims (a)-(l) were checked by computer. The only graph that needs the proof is P̂2t + 1. Let [formula] be the horizontal path of length 2t in P̂2t + 1, and let [formula]. The subgraph R = P̂2t + 1 - C is a matching consisting of t + 1 disjoint edges. The interlacing theorem shows that 1 = λt + 1(R)  ≤  λt + 1(P̂2t + 1)  ≤  λ1(R)  =  1. This completes the proof.

Part of the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:some_graphs] is based on computer computation. For a reader that may be skeptical about a proof relying on computer evidence, we show in the sequel how to obtain a self-contained proof. We will provide a sketch for a direct proof for all of the cases (in addition to the proof for P̂2t + 1 given above) that will suffice to support Corollary [\ref=cor:appendix] which is used throughout in Section [\ref=sect:improving_imbalance].

Let G be a graph in one of Figs. [\ref=fig:appendix1]-[\ref=fig:appendix3]. Let C be the set of vertices of G that are drawn as full circles or full squares. Our goal is to show that λ|C|(G)  ≤  1. Observe that in each case, G - C consists of isolated vertices, thus the Interlacing Theorem implies that λ|C| + 1(G)  ≤  0. Thus it suffices to provide evidence that there is an eigenvalue λ, where [formula].

For graphs C+4,C+8,C+12,P̂-7, and B3 we can confirm this by describing an eigenvector for eigenvalue λ = 1. For C+4,C+8,C+12, the eigenvector has value 0 on vertices of degree 2 and value [formula] on other vertices, where each vertex of degree 1 and its neighbor have the same value, and the values + 1 and - 1 alternate around the cycle. For P̂-7, the vector has values 1 on vertices of degree 1 and 3, value - 1 on vertices of degree 2 that are adjacent to the degree-3 vertices, and value - 2 on the vertex in the middle. For B3, the eigenvector has value 3 at the top vertex, values 1 on adjacent vertices, and value - 1 at all other vertices.

In the case of C+6 we can confirm that [formula] by using the interlacing theorem when we remove the vertex of degree 3 and the vertex that is opposite to it on the 6-cycle. The vertices removed in this case and in the cases treated below are shown as squares. In the case of the graph Ĉ6, we remove the two vertices on the left and two vertices on the right of the drawing. The resulting subgraph has one component isomorphic to C6, which has λ2(C6) = 1. Again, the Interlacing Theorem applies. The same happens for graphs Ĥ=0 (where we remove the two square vertices on the left of the drawing) and [formula] (where we remove five vertices). For the graph Ĥ-4 we provide an eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix4](a). For N̂0 we first remove the three square vertices and then find an eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 for the remaining subgraph (cf. Figure [\ref=fig:appendix4](b)).

This exhausts all graphs in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix1] and we proceed with those in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix2].

For the graphs Ĥ12 and Ĥ12', we remove six square vertices, and are left with a copy of the graph P̂-7 as the non-trivial component. Since λ3(P̂-7) = 1, the Interlacing Theorem applies. For the graph Ĥ13, we can remove its six square vertices, being left with a copy of the graph C+6 as the only non-trivial component. Again, the Interlacing Theorem applies.

For the graph Ĥ14, we remove five square vertices. The resulting non-trivial component Q has λ4(Q) = 1 and λ5(Q) = λ6(Q) = 0. The evidence for this is shown by three eigenvectors in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix4](d), where the unfilled values for the eigenvectors of 0 are assumed to be 0. (Note that λ7(Q) = 0 as well, but this evidence is not needed for our proof.) Finally, the graph Ĥ123 has eigenvalue 1; its eigenvector is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix4](c).

It remains to treat the graphs in Figure [\ref=fig:appendix3]. For the graph Ĥ5, we remove the four square vertices. The remaining nontrivial component Q consists of two hexagons sharing an edge plus two additional edges. Figure [\ref=fig:appendix4](e) shows two independent eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1 of Q which implies that λ4(Q)  ≤  1, and the Interlacing Theorem can be applied.

For the graph Ĥ7, we remove its six square vertices. The remaining nontrivial component Q consists of a path [formula] with added pendant edges at vertices [formula]. This graph has characteristic polynomial

[formula]

Note that φ(1) = φ(0) = 0 and that φ'(1)  >  0. Basic calculus shows that λ5(Q) = 0 and [formula] for i = 3,4.

For the graph L̂3,3, the removal of two square vertices from two of the three central hexagons and removal of three square vertices from the third hexagon give a non-trivial component that is isomorphic to P̂-7, and we are done as in some of the previous cases. The proof is also easy for Ĥ16, and Ĥ26. The removal of indicated seven square vertices leaves only one nontrivial component, which is isomorphic to C6, whose second eigenvalue is 1.

From Ĥ*6 we remove five square vertices, being left with a non-trivial component Q consisting of two adjacent hexagons plus two edges. Figure [\ref=fig:appendix4](f) contains evidence that Q has eigenvalue 1 of multiplicity at least 2, which implies that λ4(Q)  ≤  1, and interlacing arguments apply.

Finally, in the case of Ĥ06, removal of four square vertices leaves one non-trivial component, Q, which is isomorphic to the graph obtained from the path of length 10 to which we add two pendant edges at each end. The characteristic polynomial φ(λ) of Q is easily computed:

[formula]

Then φ(1) = 0 and φ'(1)  =  24  >  0. Thus, one of λ1(Q),λ3(Q),λ5(Q),λ7(Q) is equal to 1. However, λ7(Q) = 0, so we have that [formula], and interlacing can be used again. This exhausts all graphs in Figures [\ref=fig:appendix1]-[\ref=fig:appendix3].
