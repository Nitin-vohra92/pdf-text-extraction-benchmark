Additive maps preserving idempotency of products or Jordan products of operators

Introduction And Statement of the Results

The study of maps on operator algebras preserving certain properties or subsets is a topic which attracts much attention of many authors. Some of the problems are concerned with preserving a certain property of usual product or other products of operators. For example see

[formula]

AB ∈ P ⇒ φ (A) φ(B) ∈ P,

[formula]

ABA ∈ P ⇒ φ (A) φ(B) φ(A) ∈ P

[formula]

( AB+BA) ∈ P ⇒ ( φ (A) φ(B)+ φ (B) φ(A) )∈ P,

[formula]

, authors characterized the forms of unital surjective maps on B(X) preserving the nonzero idempotency of product of operators in both directions. Also in

Proofs

In this section we prove our results. First we recall some notations. Let X and Y be Banach spaces. Recall that a standard operator algebra on X is a norm closed subalgebra of B(X) which contains the identity and all finite rank operators. Denote the set of all idempotent operators of [formula] by [formula] and the Jordan product of A,B by [formula]. Also denote the dual space X by X*.

For every nonzero x∈X and f∈X*, the symbol [formula] stands for the rank one linear operator on X defined by

[formula]

If x,y∈H, then [formula] stands for the rank one linear operator on H defined by

[formula]

where < z,y >  denotes the inner product of z and y. We need some lemmas to prove our main result. Let A  ⊆  B(X) and B  ⊆  B(Y) be standard operator algebras.

The proof of the following lemma is similar to that of Lemma 2.2 in

[formula]

Let φ:A  →  B be an additive map such that preserves the nonzero idempotency of Jordan products of operators. If N∈A is a finite rank operator such that N2 = 0, then φ(N)4 = 0.

Let φ:A  →  B be an additive map. Then the following statements are hold.

(i) If φ preserves the nonzero idempotency of Jordan products of operators, then φ is injective.

(ii) If [formula] and φ preserves the nonzero idempotency of Jordan products of operators in both directions, then φ(I) = I or φ(I) =  - I.

(i) Assume φ(A) = 0. We assert that A satisfies a quadratic polynomial equation. Otherwise, by the discussion in

[formula]

φ (A) φ (B) ∈ P {0}.

[formula]

, A satisfies a quadratic polynomial equation.

Assume on the contrary that A is a nonzero operator. For any B∈A we have

[formula]

However, there exists [formula] such that [formula] is a nonzero idempotent, a contradiction. We construct such B.

By the proved assertion, A satisfies a quadratic polynomial equation. The spectrum of such A consists only of eigenvalues. If A2  ≠  0, then A has a nonzero eigenvalue λ, because in this case there exist [formula] such that rs  ≠  0 and λ satisfies a quadratic polynomial equation α2 = rα + s. Since rs  ≠  0, α2 = rα + s has a nonzero root. Let x be its eigenvector. Choose a bounded functional f with [formula] to form [formula] with the desired properties.

The remaining case is A2  =  0. Since A is nonzero, we can find a vector x so that Ax  ≠  0 and a functional f with f(x) = 0 and f(Ax) = 1 to form [formula] with the desired properties. The proof is complete.

(ii) Since [formula], there exists a nonzero operator U∈A such that φ(U) = I. We show that U = I or - I. We have [formula]. Hence we obtain

[formula]

This implies that for any x∈X, x, Ux and U2x are linear dependent. Thus U satisfies a quadratic polynomial equation, by the discussion in

[formula]

U=aU+bI. (2)

[formula]

φ (I)=I φ (I) ∈ P {0}. (3)

[formula]

(U+S-I) I=U+S-I ∈ P {0}

[formula]

φ (U+S-I) φ ( I) ∈ P {0}

[formula]

φ (I) φ(S) ∈ P {0}

[formula]

S=I S ∈ P {0}.

[formula]

U B ∈ P {0}

[formula]

φ (B)= φ (U) φ (B) ∈ P {0}.

[formula]

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Since by Lemma 2.2, φ(I) = I or φ(I) =  - I, from [formula] we obtain that φ(P) or -  φ(P) belongs to [formula]. This together with φ(0) = 0 implies that φ or -  φ preserves the idempotent operators in both directions. Hence the forms of φ follows from Theorem 2.3.

Let  dim H  ≥  3. Let A be an arbitrary operator of [formula] and P be a rank one idempotent operator. Then [formula] if and only if for every T∈ such that [formula] we have [formula], where [formula].

If [formula], then there exists a [formula] such that A = λP. hence it is trivial that for every T such that [formula] then [formula].

Conversely, Let [formula]. Since P is rank one, by

[formula]

Let φ:A  →  B be a surjective additive map such that

[formula]

for every A∈A and B∈B. Then the following statements are hold.

(i) φ(I) = I or φ(I) =  - I.

(ii) If A  =   with  dim H  ≥  3 and B  =  , then [formula], for every rank one idempotent P.

(i) It is proved by using Lemma 2.1 and similar to the proof of Lemma 2.2 in

[formula]

, φ or -  φ preserves the rank one idempotent operators in both directions. If [formula], then by Proposition 2.4, for every T∈ such that [formula] we have [formula] which by surjectivity of φ imply that for every T'∈ such that [formula] we have [formula]. Since φ(P) is a rank one idempotent, by Proposition 2.4 we can conclude that [formula]. This together with (i) and φ(0) = 0 follows that [formula]. This completes the proof.

Let H and K be two infinite dimensional real or complex Hilbert spaces and φ:  →   be an additive map. If φ preserves the idempotent operators, then φ preserves the square zero operators.

Let N∈ be a square zero operator. Then we have [formula] for some closed subspace M of H. Thus by this decomposition N has the following operator matrix

[formula]

If

[formula]

then A + nN∈ for every natural number n. It implies that φ(A) + nφ(N)∈ for every natural number n. That is,

[formula]

for all n. Setting n = 1 and n = 2 yield

[formula]

[formula]

which imply that φ(N)2 = 0 and this completes the proof.

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.2. By a similar proof to that of Lemma 2.3 in

[formula]

). This together with the part (i) of Lemma 2.5 completes the proof.
