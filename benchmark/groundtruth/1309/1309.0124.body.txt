Asymptotic normality of some graph sequences

Introduction

Let G = (V,E) be a (simple, finite, loopless) graph. An independent set in G is a subset of the vertices, no two of which are adjacent. For each integer k set

[formula]

Equivalently, [formula] is the number of proper k-colorings of G that use all k colors, with two colorings identified if they are identical up to the names of the colors. As far as we know, this parameter was first explicitly considered by Tomescu [\cite=Tomescu]. When G = En, the n-vertex graph with no edges, [formula] is just the Stirling number of the second kind [formula], the number of partitions of a set of size n into k non-empty classes; for this reason we refer to [formula] as a graph Stirling number, and to the sequence [formula] as the Stirling sequence (of the second kind) of G. For a brief history of the study of the Stirling sequence of graphs, see [\cite=GalvinThanh] and the references therein.

A seminal result in the study of the (ordinary) Stirling numbers of the second kind is Harper's theorem [\cite=Harper], which concerns asymptotic normality. Suppose that for each n  ≥  0 we have a sequence [formula] of non-negative terms with [formula]. Informally, asymptotic normality of sn means that its histogram, suitably normalized, approaches the density function of the standard normal distribution as n grows. Formally, associate with each n a random variable Xn taking values on [formula] by

[formula]

(Note that if a set consists of objects of sizes [formula], with the objects of size n divided into classes (indexed by [formula]), and if an,k counts the number of objects of size n that are in the kth class, then Xn may be interpreted as observing the class of a uniformly chosen element of size n.) We say that sn is asymptotically normal if Xn approaches a normal distribution in probability as n grows, that is, if for all [formula] we have uniformly in x

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  , where μn and σn are the mean and standard deviation of Xn, and Z is the standard normal random variable. From [\cite=Harper] we have the following.

The ordinary Stirling sequence of the second kind, [formula], is asymptotically normal.

Equivalently, the Stirling sequence of the empty graph, [formula], is asymptotically normal, raising a natural question.

For which sequences (Gn)n  ≥  0 of graphs is the Stirling sequence [formula] asymptotically normal?

We might expect that if Gn is obtained from En by a suitably small perturbation, then asymptotic normality should be preserved. Thinking along these lines, Do and Galvin [\cite=GalvinThanh] conjectured the following extension of Theorem [\ref=thm-Harper].

If Gn is an acyclic graph on n vertices then [formula] is asymptotically normal.

A standard approach to showing asymptotic normality of a sequence [formula] that is supported on a finite subset of [formula] is to show that the generating polynomial [formula] has all real zeros, and so factors into linear terms over the reals. This implies that Xn can be represented as a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, and the central limit theorem then shows that asymptotic normality is implied by the condition σn  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  . (This approach, which has often been rediscovered, is originally due to Levy [\cite=Levy].)

For acyclic Gn, showing that [formula] has only real zeros is not too hard, but due to the complexity of the expressions involved Do and Galvin were only able to establish the condition σn  →    ∞   under the addition assumption that Gn has no more than [formula] components for some suitably small c, and thus were only able to establish Conjecture [\ref=conj-GalvinThanh] under this assumption.

Here we take a different approach that allows us to prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-GalvinThanh], and to generalize it considerably. To state our main theorem, we need a little notation. We begin by introducing the family of quasi-threshold graphs, which we define inductively by three rules:

The graph K1 is a quasi-threshold graph.

If G is quasi-threshold, and G' = G + K1, the graph obtained from G by adding a dominating vertex (a new vertex adjacent to all the vertices of G), then G' is quasi-threshold.

If G1 and G2 are quasi-threshold, then [formula], the disjoint union of G1 and G2, is quasi-threshold.

Quasi-threshold graphs, which are sometimes called trivially perfect graphs, are well-known and well-studied; see e.g. [\cite=Jing-HoJer-JeongChang] for more information. Note that if a graph is constructed using only rules 1 and 2 above, then it is an example of a threshold graph.

Write χG(x) for the chromatic polynomial of G and χ(G) for its chromatic number. Say that G and H are co-chromatic if [formula]. Our main theorem is the following.

For each n, let Gn be either a quasi-threshold graph, or co-chromatic with some quasi-threshold graph. Let f(n) be the number of vertices of Gn, and let g(n) = χ(Gn) / f(n). If f(n)  →    ∞   and g(n)  →  0 as n  →    ∞   then the Stirling sequence of Gn is asymptotically normal.

To see that this implies Conjecture [\ref=conj-GalvinThanh], let Gn be an acyclic graph on n vertices. We clearly have f(n)  →    ∞   as n  →    ∞  , and since χ(Gn)  ≤  2 we also have g(n)  →  0. If Gn has k components then χGn(x)  =  xk(x - 1)n - k and so is co-chromatic with the quasi-threshold graph [formula] (a star on n - k + 1 vertices together with k - 1 isolated vertices).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main] unexpectedly passes through the normal order problem in a Weyl algebra, and in particular it makes use of four different combinatorial interpretations, due to Navon and to Engbers, Galvin and Hilyard, of the normal order coefficients of an arbitrary word in the algebra. These interpretations allow us to convert the graph Stirling number of a quasi-threshold graph into a count of matchings in a certain bipartite graph. A very general result of Kahn on asymptotic normality of matching sequences then completes the proof. In Section [\ref=sec-tools] we review all the necessary background to understand these results, and the (short) proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main] is given in Section [\ref=sec-proof].

The pieces of the puzzle

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main] involves various aspects of each of four different combinatorial interpretations the normal order of a word in a Weyl algebra. We begin by explaining these terms.

A Weyl algebra is generated by two symbols, which we shall call x and D, satisfying the single relation Dx = xD + 1. The choice of symbol names is motivated by the fact that we may represent the Weyl algebra as a set of operators on a space of infinitely differentiable functions in a single variable x by interpreting the symbol "x" as multiplication by x and "D" as differentiation with respect to x (and "1" as the identity); so, for example, the word Dx, when applied to a function f(x), results in (d / dx)(xf(x))  =  xf'(x)  +  f(x). This is the same result as would be obtained by applying xD  +  1, justifying that in this representation we have the relation Dx = xD + 1.

If w is a word in a Weyl algebra with m x's and n D's, then one can show by induction on the length of w that it has a unique representation of the form

[formula]

called the normal order of w. The study of the normal order of words goes back to the 1800's, and has recently seen significant activity owing to its occurrence in quantum mechanics; see e.g. [\cite=BlasiakHorzelaPensonSolomonDuchamp] for an introduction to this perspective.

Numerous combinatorial interpretations for the coefficients Sw(k) from ([\ref=eq-normal-order]) have been given. Here we explain the four that are of interest to us for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. We will confine our discussion to those w which are Dyck words -- words with the same number of x's as D's, and such that, reading the word from left to right, every initial segment has at least as many x's as D's. We will use n for the number of x's in w.

All but the first combinatorial interpretation depend on a certain representation in [formula] of a Dyck word. A Dyck path in [formula] is a staircase path (a path that proceeds by taking unit steps, either in the positive x direction or the positive y direction) that starts at (0,0), ends on the line x = y, any never goes below this line. There is a natural correspondence between Dyck paths and Dyck words, given by mapping steps in the positive y direction to x, and steps in the positive x direction to D. For example, the word xxDxxDxDDD (which we will use as a running example for our interpretations) corresponds to the path that goes from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5).

Sw(k) in terms of partitions of a quasi-threshold graph

To a Dyck word w we can naturally associate a quasi-threshold graph Gw inductively as follows.

If w = xD, then Gw  =  K1.

If w can be written in the form xw'D with w' a non-empty Dyck work, then Gw  =  Gw'  +  K1.

If w can be written in the form [formula] with each wi a shorter non-empty Dyck word, then [formula].

For example, if w = xxDxxDxDDD then we construct Gw by adding a dominating vertex to the graph associated with xDxxDxDD. This is the union of K1 (the graph associated with xD) and the graph associated with xxDxDD. This latter is obtained by adding a dominating vertex to [formula] (the graph associated with xDxD), so is a path on three vertices. The graph we end up with has a vertex, v1 say, adjacent to each of four vertices, v2, v3, v4, v5 say, with two edges among these four vertices, v3v4, v4v5 say, inducing a path on three vertices; call this graph Gex.

From [\cite=EngbersGalvinHilyard] we have the following.

For every Dyck word w and integer k, [formula].

For example, [formula] (the two partitions of V(Gex) into three non-empty independent sets being v1|v2v4|v3v5 and v1|v2v3v5|v4).

As well as going from Dyck words to quasi-threshold graphs, we will need to go in the other direction.

If G is a quasi-threshold graph on n vertices then there is a Dyck word w(G) with n x's and n D's such that Gw(G) = G.

We proceed by induction on the number of vertices of G. If G = K1, we just take w(G) = xD. If G on more than one vertex is of the form G'  +  K1 for some quasi-threshold graph G' then we take w to be xw'D where w' = w(G'). If G on more than one vertex breaks into components [formula], each a quasi-threshold graph, then we take w to be [formula] where for each i wi = w(Gi).

For example, because Gex has a dominating vertex (v1) we have w(Gex)  =  xw'D where w' = w(Gex - v1). Since Gex - v1 has components K1 and P3 (the path on three vertices), w' is the concatenation of xD and w'' = w(P3). Since P3 has a dominating vertex joined to two isolated vertices, [formula]. Putting all this together leads to w(G) = xxDxxDxDDD, as we would expect.

Sw(k) in terms of rook placements on a Ferrers board

Label each unit square in [formula] with the coordinates of its top-right corner (so, for example, the square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and (1,1) gets label (1,1)). Let Bw be the set of labels of the unit squares that lie above the Dyck (staircase) path of w and inside the box   ×  [0,n] (note that Bw forms a Ferrers board), and let rk(Bw) be the number of ways of placing k non-attacking rooks on Bw (that is, the number of ways of selecting a subset of Bw of size k, with no two elements of the subset sharing a first coordinate, and no two sharing a second coordinate). Navon [\cite=Navon] proved the following.

For every Dyck word w and integer k, Sk(w)  =  rn - k(Bw).

For example, if w = xxDxxDxDDD then Bw  =  {(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5)}, and S3(xxDxxDxDDD)  =  r2({(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5)})  =  2 (the two valid rook placements of size two being {(1,3),(2,5)} and {(1,4),(2,5)}).

Sw(k) in terms of partitions of a clique-union graph

Let Ww be the set of (labels of) unit squares that lie below the Dyck path of w, and completely above the line x = y. Define a graph Hw on vertex set [formula] by putting an edge from i to j (i  <  j) if and only if (i,j)∈Ww. For example, if w = xxDxxDxDDD then Ww  =  {(1,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)} and Hw is the graph on vertex set {1,2,3,4,5} with edge set {12,23,24,34,35,45}; call this graph Gex' (notice that Gex' is not isomorphic to Gex, since the former does not have a dominating vertex but the latter does). From [\cite=EngbersGalvinHilyard] we have the following.

For every Dyck word w and integer k, [formula].

So, for example, [formula] (the two partitions of V(Gex') into three non-empty independent sets being 13|25|4 and 14|25|3).

It is worth noting that Hw is determined by the places where the Dyck path of w takes a step up followed by a step to the right. To make this precise, say that the Dyck path of w turns around the unit square labeled (x,y) if it takes a step from (x - 1,y - 1) to (x - 1,y) and then steps to (x,y). Let [formula] be the set of (labels of) unit squares that the path of w turns around. Then it is easy to see that the edge set of Hw can be covered by putting a clique on each of the consecutive segments [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. (It is for this reason that we refer to Hw as a clique-union graph). For example, if w = xxDxxDxDDD then Tw  =  {(1,2),(2,4),(3,5)} and Gex' can be constructed by forming cliques on {1,2}, {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}.

Sw(k) in terms of matchings of a bipartite graph

To Bw associate a bipartite graph Γw, with partition classes [formula] and [formula], by putting an edge from xi to yj if and only if (i,j)∈Bw. A placement of k non-attacking rooks on Bw is easily see to correspond bijectively to a selection of k independent edges (edges sharing no endvertices) in Γw, that is, to a matching of size k in Γw. Write mk(Γw) for the number of matchings of size k in Γw. From Theorem [\ref=thm-fromNavon] we immediately get the following.

For every Dyck word w and integer k, Sk(w)  =  mn - k(Γw).

For example, if w = xxDxxDxDDD then X = {x1,x2,x3,x5}, Y = {y1,y2,y3,y4,y5} and Γw has edges from x1 to each of y3, y4 and y5 and also an edge from x2 to y5 (so x3, x4, x5, y1 and y2 are all isolated). In this case we get S3(xxDxxDxDDD)  =  m2(Γw)  =  2 (the two matchings of size two being {x1y3,x2y5} and {x1y4,x2y5}).

Taken together these combinatorial interpretations allow us to transform the study of the Stirling sequence of a quasi-threshold graph into the study of the matching polynomial of a bipartite graph, a realm with powerful results on which we can draw. A celebrated result of Heilmann and Lieb [\cite=HeilmannLieb] says that for any graph G, the polynomial [formula] has all real zeros, reducing the problem of showing asymptotic normality to that of showing that the variance of the size a uniformly chosen matching is sufficiently large. This is not an easy task in general; but Kahn [\cite=Kahn] found a collection of conditions, in general easier to verify than σn  →    ∞  , that imply asymptotic normality of the matching sequence. In particular, from [\cite=Kahn] we have the following.

Let (Gn)n  ≥  0 be a sequence of graphs all with minimum degree at least one, with Gn having order vn, and matching number (size of largest matching) νn. If vn  →    ∞   and νn  ~  vn / 2 as n  →    ∞  , then the matching sequence [formula] is asymptotically normal.

Putting the pieces together (proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main])

Let Gn be as given in the statement of Theorem [\ref=thm-main]. Without loss of generality we may assume that Gn is quasi-threshold. This is because the chromatic polynomial of a graph G determines its Stirling sequence, and vice-versa; on the one hand, by inclusion-exclusion,

[formula]

while on the other hand, for each positive integer q,

[formula]

where [formula].

Let wn be the Dyck word with f(n) x's and f(n) D's, given by Lemma [\ref=lem-reverse], satisfying Gwn  =  Gn. Let Hn be the clique-union graph associated with wn, as described in Section [\ref=subsec-H], and let Γn be the bipartite graph associated with wn, as described in Section [\ref=subsec-match].

Combining Theorems [\ref=thm-fromEGH], [\ref=thm-fromEGH2] and [\ref=thm-fromNavon2] we have that for each k,

[formula]

Using the symmetry of the standard normal, and the fact that the random variable (Xn  -  μn) / σn in the definition of asymptotic normality is invariant under a shift in the sequence [formula], ([\ref=eq-main]) shows that asymptotic normality of [formula] is implied by asymptotic normality of [formula].

We cannot (yet) apply Theorem [\ref=thm-Kahn], because Γn may have isolated vertices. Indeed, if wn begins with [formula] x's in a row and ends with m D's in a row, then from the construction of Γn it is clear that the isolated vertices of Γn are exactly [formula] and [formula] (as we saw with the example w = xxDxxDxDDD in Section [\ref=subsec-match]). Removing these [formula] vertices we get a graph Γ'n, with no isolated vertices, that has the same matching sequence as Γn; we will use Theorem [\ref=thm-Kahn] to show asymptotic normality of [formula], which will complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-main].

To apply Theorem [\ref=thm-Kahn] we must verify that the order vn and matching number νn of Γ'n are sufficiently large. We deal first with vn, which is evidently [formula]. Since f(n)  →    ∞   by hypothesis, to show vn  →    ∞   we need only show that [formula] and m are negligible compared to f(n). From Section [\ref=subsec-H] we known that Hn can be constructed by forming various cliques on [formula], including one on the [formula] vertices [formula] and one on the m vertices [formula]. This shows that [formula] and m are both bounded above by the clique number of Hn, which is in turn bounded above by χ(Hn), which (by ([\ref=eq-main]), which shows that Gn and Hn are co-chromatic) is equal to χ(Gn). The hypothesis g(n)  →  0 now gives vn  →    ∞  .

We now deal with νn. The smallest value of k for which [formula], and so by ([\ref=eq-main]) Swn(k), is strictly positive is k = χ(Gn), which means, again by ([\ref=eq-main]), that νn = f(n) - χ(G). From the last paragraph we know that 2f(n) - 2χ(Gn)  ≤  vn  ≤  2f(n). The hypotheses on f(n) and g(n) now easily give νn  ~  vn / 2.
