Magnetism in spin models for depleted honeycomb-lattice iridates:Spin-glass order towards percolation

Introduction

The interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling and electronic correlations is at the heart of many recent developments in condensed-matter physics, involving, e.g., correlated topological insulators, fractional Chern insulators, and spin-orbit Mott insulators [\cite=pesin10] [\cite=hohenadler13] [\cite=bergholtz13] [\cite=kim08] [\cite=kim09]. On the materials side, oxides with partially filled 5d shells, such as iridates and osmates, are considered promising candidates in order to realize the theoretically proposed phenomena.

In this context, the insulating iridates A2IrO3 (A=Na,Li) have attracted enormous attention over the past few years [\cite=Sin10] [\cite=Liu11] [\cite=Choi12] [\cite=Sin12] [\cite=Ye12] [\cite=Com12]. In these materials, the Ir4 + ions are arranged in a layered honeycomb-lattice structure. Due to the combined effect of strong spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions, the Ir 5d5 states, with one hole in the t2g manifold, have been proposed to realize Jeff = 1 / 2 spin-orbit Mott insulators [\cite=Shi09] [\cite=Jac09], similar to other layered iridates [\cite=kim08] [\cite=kim09]. Furthermore, Ref. [\cite=Cha10] suggested that the magnetism of the Jeff = 1 / 2 moments is dominated by strongly spin-anisotropic compass interactions, which by itself lead to the spin-liquid model on the honeycomb lattice proposed by Kitaev [\cite=Kit06]. Supplemented by an additional spin-isotropic Heisenberg interactions, the resulting Heisenberg-Kitaev (HK) model has been shown to host both spin-liquid and conventionally ordered phases [\cite=Cha10] [\cite=Jia11] [\cite=Reu11] [\cite=Bha12] [\cite=Cha13] [\cite=perkins12] [\cite=perkins13].

Experimentally, both Na2IrO3 and Li2IrO3 have been found to undergo a magnetic ordering transition at [formula] K [\cite=Sin10] [\cite=Liu11] [\cite=Sin12]. In Na2IrO3 the low-temperature spin configuration has been identified as collinear "zigzag" order [\cite=Choi12] [\cite=Ye12], with ferromagnetic zigzag chains arranged antiferromagnetically in the honeycomb plane. This state is indeed a ground state of the HK model, where it results from a competition of antiferromagnetic Kitaev and ferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions [\cite=Cha13]. Alternatively, Heisenberg and HK models with longer-range interactions have been considered: specifically, a Heisenberg J1-J2-J3 model with sizeable second and third-neighbor coupling has been found to describe the available data as well [\cite=Kimchi11] [\cite=Choi12]. Finally, a more itinerant scenario in terms of molecular orbitals has also been proposed [\cite=Maz12], although a detailed description of the magnetic properties in this model is lacking to date.

In this paper, we propose magnetic depletion, i.e., the random substitution of magnetic Ir4 + by non-magnetic ions, as a powerful tool to study the magnetism of A2IrO3 and to discriminate between the various proposed scenarios for magnetism. A key insight is that, within local-moment models, depletion will inevitably turn the zigzag ordered state into a spin (or spin-orbit) glass: Both the HK and J1-J2-J3 models are frustrated, and the combination of disorder and frustration generically causes spin-glass behavior [\cite=villain79]. We calculate the freezing temperature, Tg(x), as function of doping level x and show that its behavior across the site-percolation threshold, xp = 30.3%, strongly differs between the HK and J1-J2-J3 models, Fig. [\ref=fig:tg].

Models

We focus on two models which have been considered to describe the zigzag ordered state of Na2IrO3. The first is the HK model,

[formula]

the second the J1-J2-J3 model

[formula]

Here, the sums run over pairs of nearest, second, and third neighbor sites, respectively, while γ = x, y, z in Eq. [\eqref=hk] labels the three different links for each spin in a honeycomb lattice. The parameter regimes of interest are defined through the presence of zigzag magnetic order as realized in Na2IrO3 [\cite=Choi12] [\cite=Ye12]. The HK model's couplings may be parametrized as J = A cos φ and K = A sin φ, where A is an overall energy scale. Its full phase diagram was first mapped out in Ref. [\cite=Cha13], with the zigzag phase occurring for 0.51π  <  φ < 0.90π; in the following we choose φ = 0.62π. For the J1-J2-J3 model, sizeable J2 and J3 are required in order to have a zigzag magnetic ground state [\cite=rastelli79] [\cite=lhui01] [\cite=li12]. Following Ref. [\cite=Choi12], we choose J2 = 0.8J1 and J3 = 0.9J1.

As will become clear below, the magnetic properties of the depleted HK and J1-J2-J3 models depend sensitively on the presence of a magnetic coupling between the layers. For A2IrO3, no quantitative information on such coupling is available at present; it is often assumed to be small due to the A-B-type stacking of the honeycomb layers. Here we will account for the 3d character by considering a layered model with A-A stacking and a small vertical (unfrustrated) Heisenberg coupling [formula]; in application to A2IrO3 this is to be understood as an effective coupling between second-neighbor layers.

Monte-Carlo simulations

We study the models [\eqref=hk] and [\eqref=jt] using classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for unit-length spins on lattices of size L  ×  L  ×  Lz, typically with Lz = L / 2 and periodic boundary conditions. The honeycomb layers are spanned by the primitive lattice vectors [formula], with each unit cell containing two sites. Depletion is simulated by randomly removing a fraction x of spins, with x varying between 5% and 50%, with the total number of spins [formula]. We perform equilibrium MC simulations using single-site updates with a combination of the heat-bath and microcanonical (or over-relaxation) methods, with typically 106 MC steps per spin, and combine this with the parallel-tempering algorithm [\cite=mcdetails] [\cite=av12a]. Disorder averages are taken over Nrl samples, with Nrl ranging from 1000 for L = 8 to Nrl = 50 for L = 20. Below we quote energies in units of [formula], the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange.

We extract the ordering (or freezing) temperature Tg from the crossing points of ξ(T) / L for different L, according to the scaling law ξ / L = f(L1 / ν(T - Tg)), where ξ is a correlation length, f(x) a scaling function, and ν the correlation length exponent. This procedure is especially suitable to detect spin-glass freezing, as shown in previous studies of the 3d Edwards-Anderson model [\cite=lee_young1] [\cite=campos06] [\cite=viet09]. The main source of numerical error in Tg is from the L  →    ∞   extrapolation of the crossing point location required for small L.

The magnetic correlation length ξS is calculated from a fit of the static magnetic structure factor, [formula], close to the ordering wavevector [formula] (the three independent [formula] vectors corresponding to the zigzag order are [formula], [formula], and [formula], where [formula] are the reciprocal lattice vectors). Analogously, the spin-glass correlation length ξSG is obtained from the spin-glass susceptibility [formula], where [formula] is the spin-glass order parameter. Here α and β are spin components, (1,2) denote identical copies of the system ("replicas") containing the disorder configuration, [formula] denotes MC average, and av average over disorder.

Clean HK model

The 2d disorder-free HK model has been studied by various numerical methods [\cite=Cha10] [\cite=Cha13] [\cite=Reu11] [\cite=perkins12] [\cite=perkins13]. A comparison of phase diagrams shows that the classical-spin HK model reproduces [\cite=perkins13] all phases of the spin-1/2 model except for the quantum spin liquid [\cite=Cha13], with T = 0 phase boundary locations in reasonable agreement between quantum and classical models. The results in Refs. [\cite=perkins12] [\cite=perkins13] also indicate two thermal transitions upon cooling to any of the ordered low-T phases. The system enters a critical phase at Tu, with power-law spin correlations, and a state with true long-range order is reached only below Tl  <  Tu. This behavior parallels that of a 2d six-state clock model [\cite=clock], as suggested by the sixfold degeneracy of the ordered states in the HK model.

For selected values of φ, we have verified that our MC simulations, applied to the 2d HK model ([formula]), reproduce the results of Ref. [\cite=perkins13]. In particular, the specific heat, Fig. [\ref=fig:clean](a), shows a broad peak far above both Tu and Tl while the singularity at the transitions is weak - this reflects the presence of strong fluctuations in the 2d system. Nevertheless, there is a well-defined crossing point in ξS / L at Tl where long-range order sets in, Fig. [\ref=fig:clean](c).

We have then switched on the inter-layer coupling [formula] and monitored the evolution of the transition temperature, Fig. [\ref=fig:clean](d). As expected on general grounds, the critical intermediate phase of the 2d system disappears for finite [formula], such that there is only a single thermal phase transition at TN, which now displays a pronounced specific-heat singularity, Fig. [\ref=fig:clean](b). For [formula], TN is larger than both Tl and Tu of the 2d system, and our data is compatible with [formula] as [formula], although finite-size effects hamper an accurate determination of TN for [formula], Fig. [\ref=fig:clean](d).

Clean J1-J2-J3 model. We have also performed corresponding simulations for the J1-J2-J3 model. Here, [formula] for [formula] due to the assumed continuous spin symmetry. For [formula] we have [formula].

Magnetic depletion

We now describe our central results, obtained for the depleted HK and J1-J2-J3 models, with a concentration x of randomly placed vacancies. Since both models are frustrated, the introduction of vacancies generate local non-collinearities in the spin order [\cite=henley89], which ultimately leads to spin-glass behavior [\cite=villain79].

We have first studied the 2d case ([formula]) and found - in both models and for any [formula] - indications of neither conventional nor spin-glass order at finite temperature. This is expected: conventional order is suppressed, due to the combination of disorder and frustration, in favor of spin-glass magnetism. However, the glass temperature is strictly zero in two dimensions [\cite=Bray84] [\cite=fischer] even in the case of Ising symmetry.

For finite interlayer coupling the situation changes, with sample results shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:dirty]. While conventional long-range order is absent for any x  ≥  5%, spin-glass order emerges instead at low T. The latter is signified by a well-defined common crossing point in ξSG / L and a corresponding scaling, Fig. [\ref=fig:dirty](c)-(d) [\cite=nu]. In contrast, existing crossing points of ξS / L display a systematic downward shift with increasing L, indicative of short-range zigzag spin correlations, Fig. [\ref=fig:dirty](b). We note that we do not reach the limit L  ≫  ξS(T = 0) where crossing points would be absent entirely.

Short-range magnetic order also manifests itself in the specific heat, Fig. [\ref=fig:dirty](a). The peak in C(T) is broad and occurs at a temperature considerably larger than the freezing temperature (here [formula]), indicating that this short-range order builds up at temperature considerably higher than Tg. We stress that this behavior is a hallmark of glassy systems [\cite=av12a] [\cite=fischer], and it is, in principle, disconnected from the non-trivial behavior of the 2d disorder-free HK model [\cite=perkins12], Fig. [\ref=fig:clean](a).

To account for the possibility of different (non-zigzag) dilution-induced magnetic ground state, we monitored [formula] in the reciprocal space, but (within our resolution) we detected peaks only at the [formula] vectors corresponding to the zigzag order. However, these peaks grow slower than the system size, Fig. [\ref=fig:dirty](b), again indicating static short-range order with a vanishing magnetic order parameter.

Small doping and glassiness

In both the Heisenberg-Kitaev and J1-J2-J3 models, we find a single vacancy to produce anticollinear states [\cite=henley89]. Multiple vacancies have a somewhat different effect in the two models: In the Heisenberg-Kitaev case, the vacancies locally select specific stripe orientations due to spin-orbit coupling [\cite=trousselet11], causing domains with different stripe orientation to coexist. In the J1-J2-J3 model, instead, the effect of long-range distortions of the spin pattern is more prominent, due to the presence of gapless bulk modes. Remarkably, for the vacancy concentrations of interest, x  ≥  20%, the spin configurations we observe in both models are virtually indistinguishable and are characterized by a short-range domain structure, Fig. [\ref=fig:spatial].

Based on our MC data, we are unable to decide whether long-range order is destroyed in favor of spin-glass order at infinitesimal x or at a finite critical xc (with xc < 5%). We leave a more detailed characterization of the small-doping behavior for future work.

Ordering temperature and percolation

An easily accessible quantity is the ordering (or freezing) temperature Tg as function of x. While one generally expects that Tg decreases with increasing x, the behavior at large x contains information on the nature of the magnetic couplings: For a layered local-moment system with nearest-neighbor couplings, Tg will diminish near the threshold xp for 2d site percolation, because for x > xp the layers fragment into disconnected spin clusters, and for Heisenberg symmetry Tg(x) / Tg(x = 0) will vanish as [formula] in the limit of small interlayer coupling. In contrast, in systems with longer-range magnetic couplings, Tg will stay finite across xp [\cite=percfoot]. The parent compounds of cuprate superconductors beautifully exemplify this physics: the Neel temperature in Zn-doped La2CuO4 vanishes essentially at the square-lattice percolation threshold of xp = 40.5% [\cite=greven02] - this proves that the cuprate magnetism is dominated by nearest-neighbor coupling.

Our results for Tg(x) are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:tg]. As expected from the above discussion, Tg of the nearest-neighbor HK model rapidly drops towards the honeycomb-lattice xp = 30.3% and becomes smaller than our lowest simulation temperature (J / 80) for [formula] for [formula]. (Note that, due to the finite [formula], Tg is expected to be non-vanishing up to the 3d percolation threshold, however, it is undetectably small for [formula].) For smaller interlayer coupling this apparent vanishing of Tg(x) appears at even smaller x.

In contrast, Tg of the J1-J2-J3 model continues its approximately linear variation with x across xp and extrapolates to our lowest simulation temperature at a much larger doping level of [formula] [\cite=triang]. For both models, Tg(x) / Tg(x   =   0) diminishes with decreasing [formula], and small [formula] induce a curvature in Tg(x) which is particularly pronounced at small x.

Summary

We have studied the magnetism of local-moment models for A2IrO3 under magnetic depletion. A spin-orbit glass, with zigzag short-range order, emerges generically from the combination of strong spin-orbit coupling, frustration, and disorder. We have determined the glass (or freezing) temperature Tg as function of the doping level x, which at large doping differs qualitatively between the HK and J1-J2-J3 models, Fig. [\ref=fig:tg](a).

We thus propose to employ magnetic depletion, using dopants with magnetically inert d shells, as a tool to assess the importance of longer-range magnetic couplings in the A2IrO3 compounds: If the experimental Tg were found to vanish near xp this would strongly hint [\cite=itfoot] at short-range HK physics being realized in A2IrO3, as originally proposed in Refs. [\cite=Cha10] [\cite=Cha13]. Conversely, the absence of such vanishing would imply significant longer-range interactions.

Note added. Very recent experiments [\cite=geg14], using non-magnetic Ti dopants substituting for Ir, show significant differences between depleted Na2IrO3 and Li2IrO3 across the percolation threshold.
