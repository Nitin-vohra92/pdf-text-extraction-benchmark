Abstract

Introduction

Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent the later evolutionary stages of massive stars (single or in binaries) with initial main sequence masses larger than [formula]. The exact evolutionary paths for such high mass stars are not well established and there are several possibilities depending on various factors such as initial mass, rotation rate and magnetic field [\citep=langer12] for a recent overview of the situation. Clearly, better statistical information covering a range of stellar parameters can help in the understanding of likely evolutionary scenarios for very massive stars. In the last 10 years or so the number of known WR stars has more than doubled [\citep=shara09] [\citep=shara2012] [\citep=hadfield07] [\citep=mauerhan11], with more than 430 galactic WR stars now known. This article reports on early, previously unreported, work in identifying WR stars in the galaxy.

Candidate Galactic WR Stars

The strong winds and significant mass loss of WR stars lead to a power-law spectrum excess from the wind with spectral index of 2.7 to 3.2 which is in addition to the photospheric emission [\citep=morris93]. This becomes particularly notable in the near- to mid-infrared [\citep=mauerhan11]. The Spitzer/GLIMPSE survey of the galactic plane at galactic latitudes - 1 deg   <  b  <   + 1 deg  provides infrared fluxes for tens of millions of sources in the wavelength range 3.8μm to 8μm benjamin03. The 2MASS survey covers the whole sky at the near-infrared JHKs wavebands. Combining GLIMPSE and 2MASS colours allows a colour-colour diagram of sources where WR stars are in a clearly defined colour space containing a relatively low percentage of objects (Figure [\ref=fig:ccdiag]). The reddening vector shows that WR stars remain in a clearly distinguishable region of the colour-colour diagram.

In the initial pilot project reported here, candidates were chosen from a 2deg  region around RCW 49 and a relatively random region of the galaxy around a galactic latitude of 318 deg   <  l  <  320 deg . These were followed up with spectra taken with the SOFI instrument on board the New Technology Telescope (NTT) on La Silla, Chile, effectively covering the 1.8 to 2.5 μm spectral range in June 2005. This covers a number diagnostic H, He and C line wavelengths for identifying WN and WC subtypes of WR stars. Since only spectral line diagnostics were needed, flux calibration was not required and weather conditions were variable. Further optical spectroscopy followup was performed on the CTIO 4m Blanco telescope using the RC spectrometer in March 2006.

Spectral results

Our spectral follow-up revealed a [formula]% success rate for finding WR stars. A total of 6 new WR stars were found from 42 candidate stars viewed. Four of these new WR stars were found away from the Westerlund 2 cluster/RCW49 field while two further WR stars were found in the RCW49 region outer regions. These include 2 WC stars and 4 WN stars, including the new WN10 star G321.0331-00.4274 (see Figure [\ref=fig:wn10]).

In total, 80% of stars showed emission lines. Most of these are Be (or sometimes O) stars. Examples are shown in Fig.A1 of [\citet=mauerhan11] where the H and K band spectra are dominated by HI emission lines.

Conclusions

Later work has improved the colour selection criterion of the method used here [\citet=mauerhan11] and a significant number of candidates are still to be looked at. [\citet=rlopes11a] [\citet=rlopes11b] [\citet=rlopes11c] have presented the discovery SOFI infrared spectra of 5 of the 6 WR stars discovered in this study using SOFI archival data. These are referred to as WR20aa, WR20c, WR60aa, WR67a, and WR67b. Identifying WR star candidates via their infrared colours has since been improved [\citep=hadfield07] [\citep=mauerhan09] [\citep=mauerhan11].

One of the curious aspects of this work - as has also been seen in the further studies of [\citet=hadfield07] and [\citet=mauerhan11] - is the fact that as many newly discovered WR stars are found well away from dense star clusters as associated with them. Since their lives are so short many of these objects may be formed in situ or very near by. Alternately, there is a large fraction of WR stars forming a population of fast moving, runaway stars in the galaxy. Something that may well be resolved by upcoming GAIA observations.
