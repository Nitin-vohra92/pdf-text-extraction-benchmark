Energy estimates for a class of semilinear elliptic equations on half Euclidean balls

Introduction

In this article we consider

[formula]

where u > 0 is a positive continuous solution, B+3 is the upper half ball centered at the origin with radius 3, g is a continuous function on (0,  ∞  ) and h is locally Hölder continuous on (0,  ∞  ).

If [formula] and [formula], the equation ([\ref=equ23]) is a typical prescribing curvature equation. If we use δ to represent the Euclidean metric, then [formula] is conformal to δ. Equation ([\ref=equ23]) in this special case means the scalar curvature under the new metric is 4(n - 1) / (n - 2) and the boundary mean curvature under the new metric is [formula]. Equation ([\ref=equ23]) is very closely related to the well known Yamabe problem and the boundary Yamabe problem. For g and h we assume

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then if ch > 0 we assume

[formula]

If ch  ≤  0 our assumption on g,h is

[formula]

The main result of this article is concerned with the case ch > 0:

Let u > 0 be a solution of ([\ref=equ23]) where g and h satisfy GH0 and GH1. Suppose ch > 0 and GH2 also holds, then

[formula]

for some C > 0 that depends only on g, h and n.

Obviously if

[formula]

g and h satisfy the assumptions in Theorem [\ref=mainthm1]. The energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) for this special case has been proved by Li-Zhang [\cite=lei]. It is easy to see that the assumptions of g and h in Theorem [\ref=mainthm1] include a much large class of functions. For example, for any non-increasing function c1(s) satisfying lim s  →    ∞c1(s) > 0 and [formula], [formula] satisfies the assumptions of g. Similarly [formula] for a nondecreasing function c2(s) with lim s  →    ∞c2(s) = ch and [formula], satisfies the requirement of h in Theorem [\ref=mainthm1].

For the case ch  ≤  0 we have

Let u > 0 be a solution of ([\ref=equ23]) where g and h satisfy GH0 and GH1. Suppose ch  ≤  0 and g,h satisfy GH3, then the energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) holds for C depending only on g, h and n.

If we allow [formula], then the energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) may not hold. For example, let [formula], then g satisfies the assumption in Theorem [\ref=minorthm] except that [formula]. Let [formula], it is easy to verify that uj satisfies

[formula]

Note that h = 0 in this case. Then clearly ([\ref=equ24]) does not hold for uj.

The energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) is closely related to the following Harnack type inequality:

[formula]

which was proved by Li-Zhang [\cite=lei] for the special case ([\ref=spegh]). Li-Zhang [\cite=lei] also proved the ([\ref=equ24]) for ([\ref=spegh]) using ([\ref=minmax]) in their argument in a nontrivial way.

In the past two decades Harnack type inequalities similar to ([\ref=minmax]) have played an important role in blowup analysis for semilinear elliptic equations with critical Sobolev exponents. Pioneer works in this respect can be found in Schoen [\cite=schoen1], Schoen-Zhang [\cite=schoen-zhang], Chen-Lin [\cite=chen-lin-cpam1], and further extensive results can be found in [\cite=chen-lin-2] [\cite=gui-lin] [\cite=aobing] [\cite=lei] [\cite=li-zhang-4d] [\cite=lin-pra] [\cite=schoen-zhang] [\cite=zhang2] and the references therein. Usually for a semi-linear equation without boundary condition, for example the conformal scalar curvature equation

[formula]

a Harnack inequality of the type

[formula]

immediately leads to the energy estimate

[formula]

by the Green's representation theorem and integration by parts. However, when the boundary condition as in ([\ref=equ23]) appears, using the Harnack inequality ([\ref=minmax]) to derive ([\ref=equ24]) is much more involved. In order to derive energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) and pointwise estimates for blow up solutions, Li and Zhang prove the following results in [\cite=lei]:

Theorem A (Li-Zhang). Let u > 0 be a solution of ([\ref=equ23]) where g and h satisfy GH0, GH1 and GH3. Then

[formula]

Here we note that in Theorem A no sign of ch is specified. One would expect the energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) to follow directly from Li-Zhang's theorem. This is indeed the case if ch  ≤  0. However for ch > 0 substantially more estimates are needed in order to establish a precise point-wise estimate for blowup solutions. As a matter of fact we need to assume (GH2) instead of (GH3) in order to obtain ([\ref=equ24]).

The organization of this article is as follows. In section two we prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm1]. The idea of the proof is as follows. First we use a selection process to locate regions in which the bubbling solutions look like global solutions. Then we consider the interaction of the bubbling regions. Using delicate blowup analysis and Pohozaev identity we prove that bubbling regions must be a positive distance apart. Then the energy estimate ([\ref=equ24]) follows. Even thought the main idea we use to prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm1] is similar to Li-Zhang's proof of the special case [formula], there are a lot of technical difficulties for the more general case. For example Li-Zhang's proof relies heavily on the fact that the equation is invariant under scaling, thus they don't need any classification theorem in their moving sphere argument. However in the more general case the equation is not scaling invariant any more and we have to use the classification theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck or Li-Zhu. In section three we prove Theorem [\ref=minorthm] using Theorem A and integration by parts.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm1]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm1] is by way of contradiction. Suppose there is no energy bound, then there exists a sequence uk such that

[formula]

We claim that max B+3 / 2uk  →    ∞  . Indeed, if this is not the case, which means there is a uniform bound for uk on B+3 / 2, we just take a cut-off function η∈C∞ such that [formula] on B+1 and [formula] on [formula] and [formula]. Multiplying the equation ([\ref=equ23]) by ukη2, using integration by parts and simple Cauchy's inequality we obtain a uniform bound of [formula], a contradiction to ([\ref=aug14e1]).

Let {uk} be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=equ23]). Assume that [formula] and lim k  →    ∞uk(xk) =   ∞  . If there exist C > 0 (independent of k) and  > 0 (independent of k) such that [formula] for |x - x̄|  ≤  , then we say that x̄ is an isolated blowup point of {uk}.

Let {uk} be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=equ23]) and

[formula]

then there exist a sequence of local maximum points x̄k such that along a subsequence (still denoted as {uk})

[formula]

either converges uniformly over all compact subsets of [formula] to V that satisfies

[formula]

(where [formula]), or converges to V1 defined on [formula] ( [formula] ) that satisfies

[formula]

where [formula].

All solutions of ([\ref=global1]) are described by the classification theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck [\cite=caffarelli]. All solutions of ([\ref=global2]) are described by Li-Zhu [\cite=liandzhu].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop3.1]:

Let xk∈B+1 be a sequence such that

[formula]

Let dk = |xk| and [formula]. Set

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Let [formula], then clearly ([\ref=13aug9e1]) can be written as

[formula]

For all x∈B+σk(x̂k), since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Using |x - x̂k|  ≤  σk, and

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Let Mk = uk(x̂k) and

[formula]

Direct computation shows

[formula]

By ([\ref=equ7]) we have

[formula]

We consider the following two cases.

Case one: [formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] both tend to infinity, ([\ref=13aug9e3]) is defined on |y|  ≤  lk for some lk  →    ∞  . By ([\ref=13aug9e2]) we assume that vk is bounded above in Blk. We claim that vk  →  V uniformly over all compact subsets of [formula] and V satisfies ([\ref=global1]) with [formula]. Indeed, we claim that for any R > 1,

[formula]

Once ([\ref=localbd]) is established, we see clearly that MkVk  →    ∞   over all BR, thus

[formula]

over all compact subsets of [formula]. Then it is easy to see that V solves ([\ref=global1]).

Therefore we only need to establish ([\ref=localbd]) for fixed R > 1. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows from (GH1) that in [formula]

[formula]

For y∈ΩR,k we use (GH2) to obtain

[formula]

In either case ak(y) is a bounded function . From

[formula]

and standard Harnack inequality we have

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=localbd]) is established. Consequently V, as the limit of vk indeed solves ([\ref=global1]). By the classification theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck [\cite=caffarelli]

[formula]

Obviously V has a maximum point [formula]. Correspondingly there exists a sequence of local maximum points of uk, denoted x̄k, that tends to x̄ after scaling. Thus vk can be defined as in the statement of Proposition [\ref=prop3.1].

Case two: [formula].

In this case we let

[formula]

It is easy to verify that vk satisfies

[formula]

We claim that for any R > 1, there exists C(R) > 0 such that

[formula]

The proof of ([\ref=13aug15e1]) is similar to the interior case. Let [formula] and pk = (0', - Tk). On [formula] we write the equation for vk as

[formula]

where it is easy to use GH2 to prove that |ak| + |bk|  ≤  C for some C independent of k and R. By a classical Harnack inequality with boundary terms (for example, see Lemma 6.2 of [\cite=zhang1] or Han-Li [\cite=hanli]), we have

[formula]

Therefore vk is bounded below by positive constants over all compact subsets. Thus the limit function V1 solves ([\ref=global2]). By Li-Zhu's classification theorem [\cite=liandzhu],

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], λ is determined by V1(0) = 1. Thus the local maximum of V1 can be used to defined vk as in the statement of the proposition. Proposition [\ref=prop3.1] is established. [formula]

Proposition [\ref=prop3.1] determines the first point in the blowup set Σk. The other points in Σk can be determined as follows: Consider the maximum of

[formula]

If Sk(x) is uniformly bounded we stop. Otherwise the same selection process we get another blowup profile by either the classification theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck or Li-Zhu. Eventually we have {qik}∈Σk (i = 1,2,..,) that satisfy

[formula]

and rki are chosen so that in B+rki(qki), the profile of uk is either like an entire standard bubble described in ([\ref=global1]) or a part of the bubble described in ([\ref=global2]).

Take any qk∈Σk, let [formula] and we let

[formula]

where Ωk: = {y;  qk  +  σky∈B+3}. By the selection process we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We further prove in the following proposition that ũk decays like a harmonic function:

[formula]

The meaning of Proposition [\ref=prop3.2] is each isolated blowup point is also isolated simple.

Direct computation shows that ũk satisfies

[formula]

Let k  =  ũk(0). By ([\ref=aug15e11]) k  →    ∞  . Set

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that vk is defined on a bigger set, but for the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop3.2] we only need to consider the part in k.

Direct computation gives

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. We consider two cases.

Case one: Tk  →    ∞  .

By the same argument as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop3.1], we know vk  →  V in [formula] where V solves ([\ref=global1]). Thus there exist Rk  →    ∞   such that

[formula]

Clearly ([\ref=isosimple1]) holds for [formula], we just need to prove ([\ref=isosimple1]) for [formula]. Since V(0) = 1 is the maximum point of V,

[formula]

There exists k0 > 1 such that for all k  ≥  k0 and [formula],

[formula]

Proof of Lemma [\ref=har1]:

Suppose ([\ref=aug16e1]) does not hold, then there exist rk such that

[formula]

Clearly rk  ≥  Rk.

Let

[formula]

The equation of vλk, by direct computation, is

[formula]

where

[formula]

Clearly vλk  →  Vλ in [formula] for fixed λ > 0. By direct computation

[formula]

We shall apply the method of moving spheres for [formula]. First we prove that for [formula],

[formula]

To prove ([\ref=aug16e3]) we first observe that vk > vλ0k in [formula] for any fixed R large. Indeed, vk = vλ0k on ∂Bλ0. On ∂Bλ0 we have ∂νV > ∂νVλ0. Thus the C1,α convergence of vk to V gives that vk > vλ0k near ∂Bλ0. Then by the uniform convergence we further know that ([\ref=aug16e3]) holds on [formula]. On ∂BR, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some ε > 0 independent of k. Next we shall use maximum principle to prove that

[formula]

The proof of ([\ref=greaterhar]) is by contradiction. We shall compare vk and

[formula]

Clearly vk - fk is super harmonic in Σλ0 - BR and, by ([\ref=sept3e2]),([\ref=sept3e1]) and ([\ref=aug16e2]), vk - fk > 0 on ∂BR and [formula]. If there exists [formula] and

[formula]

we would have

[formula]

Easy to verify [formula] for some Nk  →    ∞  . However by GH1

[formula]

Easy to see it is impossible to have vk(z0) < fk(z0) and ([\ref=aug16e11]). ([\ref=greaterhar]) is established.

Before we employ the method of moving spheres we set

[formula]

This is the region where maximum principle needs to be applied.

By GH1 we have

[formula]

Therefore in Oλ we have

[formula]

The equation for vk can certainly be written as

[formula]

Let wλ,k = vk - vλk, we have, from ([\ref=aug19e1]) and ([\ref=aug19e2])

[formula]

where ξk is obtained from the mean value theorem.

Now we apply the method of moving spheres to wλ,k. Let

[formula]

where ε0 > 0 is chosen to be independent of k and

[formula]

From ([\ref=aug16e2]) we see that ε0 can be chosen easily. By ([\ref=aug16e3]), [formula]. We claim that [formula]. Suppose this is not the case we have [formula]. By continuity wλ̄k,k  ≥  0 and by ([\ref=aug16e2]) wλ̄k,k > 0 on the outside boundary: [formula]. By ([\ref=wlam]), if min λ̄kwλ̄k,k = 0, the minimum will have to appear on ∂Σλ̄k. From ([\ref=sept16e1]) we see that the minimum does not appear on [formula]. If there exists [formula], we have

[formula]

Note that we have strict inequality because of Hopf Lemma. On the other hand, using Tk  →    ∞   and elementary estimates we have

[formula]

For vk, GH1 implies

[formula]

where [formula]. Then it is easy to see that wλ̄k > 0 on {zn =  - Tk}. Then Hopf Lemma and the continuity lead to a contradiction of the definition of λ̄k. Thus we have proved [formula]. However V < Vλ for |y| > λ if [formula]. So it is impossible to have [formula]. This contradiction proves ([\ref=aug16e1]) under Case one. Lemma [\ref=har1] is established.

From Lemma [\ref=har1] we further prove the spherical Harnack inequality for vk. For fixed k, consider [formula] and let

[formula]

By ([\ref=aug15e10]), ṽk(z)  ≤  C. Direct computation yields

[formula]

Let

[formula]

By the definition of of lk and r we see that [formula]. Using the assumptions of g we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence ak and bk are both bounded functions.

Consequently the equation for ṽk can be written as

[formula]

Clearly we apply classical Harnack inequality for two cases: either Tk / r > 1 or Tk / r  ≤  1. In the first case we have

[formula]

In the second case we have

[formula]

Clearly ([\ref=isosimple1]) is implied. Proposition [\ref=prop3.2] is established for Case one.

Case two: lim k  →    ∞Tk = T

Recall that vk satisfies ([\ref=c2vk]).

By the same argument as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop3.1], we know vk  →  V in [formula] where V solves ([\ref=global2]). Thus there exist Rk  →    ∞   such that

[formula]

Clearly ([\ref=isosimple1]) holds for [formula], we just need to prove ([\ref=isosimple1]) for [formula]. Since V(0) = 1 is the maximum point of V,

[formula]

There exists k0 > 1 such that for all k  ≥  k0 and [formula],

[formula]

Proof of Lemma [\ref=har2]:

Just like the interior case suppose there exist rk  ≥  Rk such that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

be the domain of ṽk. Then [formula]. Set

[formula]

Let ṽ be the limit of ṽk in [formula]:

[formula]

then there exists λ0  <  λ1 depending only on n,A,T such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We shall employ the method of moving spheres to compare ṽk and ṽλk on Σλ for λ∈[λ0,λ1].

First we use the uniform convergence of ṽk to ṽ to assert that, for any fixed R > 1

[formula]

For R large we have (let [formula])

[formula]

and

[formula]

To prove ṽk  >  ṽλ0k in [formula] we compare ṽk with

[formula]

where [formula]. For R chosen sufficiently large we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

To compare ṽk and w over [formula], it is easy to see that ṽk > w on [formula] and [formula]. Since ṽk - w is super-harmonic, the only thing we need to prove is on [formula]

[formula]

for some positive function ξk. Then standard maximum principle can be used to conclude that ṽk > wk on [formula].

To obtain ([\ref=case2bry]) first for ṽk we use GH2 to have

[formula]

On the other hand by the choice of A1 we verify easily that

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=case2bry]) holds from mean value theorem. We have proved that the moving sphere process can start at λ  =  λ0:

[formula]

Let λ̄ be the critical moving sphere position:

[formula]

As in Case one we shall prove that λ̄  =  λ1, thus getting a contradiction from ṽ  <  ṽλ1 for |z| > λ1. For this purpose we let

[formula]

To derive the equation for wλ,k we first recall from ([\ref=c2vk]) and the definition of ṽk that

[formula]

where [formula]. Correspondingly ṽλk satisfies

[formula]

Let Oλ be defined as before. Then in Oλ we have, by GH1,

[formula]

The inequalities above yield

[formula]

where ξ1,k > 0 and ξ2,k are continuous functions obtained from mean value theorem. It is easy to see that the moving sphere argument can be employed to prove that λ̄  =  λ1, which leads to a contradiction from the limiting function ṽ. Thus Lemma [\ref=har2] is established. [formula]

Lemma [\ref=har2] guarantees that on each radius [formula] the minimum of vk is always comparable to |z|2 - n. Re-scaling vk as [formula] we see the spherical Harnack inequality holds by the GH2 and GH3. Thus Proposition [\ref=prop3.2] is established in Case Two as well.

Let {uk} be a sequence of solutions of ([\ref=equ23]) and [formula] be a sequence of points in Σk. Then there exist C > 0, r2 > 0 independent of k such that

[formula]

Without loss of generality we assume that qks are local maximum points of uk. We consider two cases

Case one: [formula].

Let Mk = uk(qk) and

[formula]

Then in this case vk converges uniformly to

[formula]

over all compact subsets of [formula]. For ε > 0 small we let

[formula]

on |y|  ≥  R where R > 1 is chosen so that vk  >  φ on ∂BR. By direct computation we have

[formula]

for some Nk  →    ∞  . It is easy to see that vk  ≥  φ on [formula]. On [formula] we have

[formula]

Thus standard maximum principle implies vk  ≥  φ on Ωk. Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] is established in this case.

Now we consider

Case two: [formula]

Let vk be defined as in ([\ref=vkd1]). In this case the boundary condition is written as

[formula]

vk converges to V1 over all compact subsets of [formula] where

[formula]

V1 satisfies ([\ref=global2]).

For R large and ε > 0 small, both independent of k, we have

[formula]

In [formula] we have the uniform convergence of vk to V1. Our goal is to prove that vk is bounded below by O(1)|y|2 - n outside BR. To this end let

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then it is easy to check that

[formula]

By choosing R larger if needed we have

[formula]

Then it is easy to apply maximum principle to prove vk > w in [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] is established.

Let qk1∈Σk and qk2 be its nearest or almost nearest sequence in Σk:

[formula]

We claim that

There exists C > 0 independent of k such that

[formula]

Let [formula] and

[formula]

We use ek to denote the image of qk2 after scaling (so |ek|  →  1). Then in B1, ũk(x)  ~  ũk(0)- 1|x|2 - n for |x|  ~  1 / 2. On one hand, for [formula] we have, by Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] applied to ek,

[formula]

which is just uk(qk1)  ≤  Cuk(qk2). On the other hand, the same moving sphere argument can be applied to uk near qk2 with no difference. The Harnack type inequality gives

[formula]

Using

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=aug27e1]) gives uk(qk2)  ≤  Cuk(qk1). Lemma [\ref=compa-able] is established.

Proposition [\ref=prop3.2] is not needed in the proof of Lemma [\ref=compa-able].

The following lemma is concerned with Pohozaev identity that can be verified by direct computation.

Let u solve

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula].

There exists d > 0 independent of k such that

[formula]

Recall that σk = (1 + o(1))|qk1 - qk2|. We prove by way of contradiction. Suppose σk  →  0, et k  =  ũk(0). We claim that

[formula]

where k  =  {y;  σky + qk1∈B+3}.

Proof of ([\ref=har-pos]): As usual we consider the following two cases:

Case one: [formula], and Case two: [formula]

First we consider Case one. Let

[formula]

Recall the equation for ũk is ([\ref=tildeuk]). Multiplying k on both sides and letting k  →    ∞   it is easy to see from the assumptions of g and h that kũk  →  h in [formula] where h is a harmonic function defined in [formula]. Thus

[formula]

for some harmonic function b(y) in B1. From the pointwise estimate in Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] we see that a > 0. Given any ε > 0, we compare ũk and

[formula]

on |y|  ≤  Rk. Here Rk  →    ∞   is less than Tk. Observe that ũk > wk on ∂BRk and |y| = ε1 for ε1 sufficiently small. Thus ũk > wk by the maximum principle. Let k  →    ∞   we have, in B1

[formula]

Then let ε  →  0, which implies ε1  →  0 we have b(y)  ≥  0 in B1. Next we claim that b(0) > 0 because by Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] and Lemma [\ref=compa-able] we have

[formula]

for some a1 > 0, where e =  lim k  →    ∞ek. Thus b(y) > 0 when y is close to e, which leads to b(0) > 0. ([\ref=har-pos]) is established in Case one.

Case two.

Again we first have kũk  →  h in [formula] and h is of the form

[formula]

To prove b(y)  ≥  0 we compare, for fixed ε > 0, kũk with

[formula]

where bk  →  0 and Rk  →    ∞   are chosen to satisfy

[formula]

and

[formula]

It is easy to see that such bk and Rk can be found easily. Let hk  =  kũk, and [formula]. We divide ∂'Ωk into two parts:

[formula]

Then by the assumptions on h

[formula]

With the choice of bk and Rk it is easy to verify that

[formula]

Thus standard maximum principle can be applied to prove hk  ≥  wk on [formula]. Letting k  →    ∞   first and ε  →  0 next we have b(y)  ≥  0 in [formula]. Then by Proposition [\ref=compa-able] we see that b(y) > 0 when y is close to e, the limit of ek. The fact ∂nb = 0 at 0 implies b(0) > 0. ([\ref=har-pos]) is proved in both cases.

Finally to finish the proof of Proposition [\ref=sing-apart] we derive a contradiction from each of the following two cases:

Case one: [formula].

In this case we use the following Pohozaev identity on Bσ for [formula]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

First we claim that for s > 0,

[formula]

Indeed, writing [formula], we see from GH1 that c(t) is a non-increasing function, thus

[formula]

Replacing s by ũk we see that the left hand side of ([\ref=pohoz1]) is non-negative. Next we prove that

[formula]

for σ > 0 small. Clearly after ([\ref=pohoe2]) is established we obtain a contradiction to ([\ref=pohoz1]). To this end first we prove that

[formula]

Indeed, by GH1 and GH3

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Clearly ([\ref=sept5e1]) holds in either case. Consequently we write the left hand side of ([\ref=pohoe2]) as

[formula]

where

[formula]

By direct computation we have

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=pohoe2]) is verified when σ > 0 is small.

The second case we consider is Case two: [formula].

In this case we use the following Pohozaev identity on B+σ: Let

[formula]

then we have

[formula]

Multiplying 2k on both sides and letting k  →    ∞   we see by the same estimate as in Case one that the second term on the left hand side is non-negative, the right hand side is strictly negative. The only term we need to consider is

[formula]

Let [formula], then from integration by parts we have

[formula]

For the first term on the right hand side of ([\ref=sept5e3]) we claim

[formula]

Indeed, by GH1 and GH2

[formula]

Using ũk = O(1 / k) on ∂Bσ we then have

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=sept5e5]) is verified and the first term on the right hand side of ([\ref=sept5e3]) is o(1).

Therefore we only need to estimate the last term of ([\ref=sept5e3]), which we claim is non-negative. Indeed, for t > 0, we write [formula] for some non-decreasing function b. Then we have

[formula]

Replacing s by ũk in the above we see that the last term of ([\ref=sept5e3]) is non-negative. Thus there is a contradiction in ([\ref=pohoz2]) in Case two as well. Proposition [\ref=sing-apart] is established.

We are in the position to finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm1]. By Proposition [\ref=sing-apart] there is a positive distance between any two members of Σk. The uniform bound of [formula] follows readily from the pointwise estimates for blowup solutions near an isolated blowup point. The uniform bound for [formula] can be obtained by scaling and standard elliptic estimates for linear equations. Thus we have obtained a contradiction to ([\ref=aug14e1]). Theorem [\ref=mainthm1] is established. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=minorthm]

If h is non-positive, the energy estimate follows from the Harnack inequality in a straight forward way. Indeed, let G(x,y) be a Green's function on B+3 such that G(x,y) = 0 if [formula] and ∂ynG(x,y) = 0 for [formula]. It is easy to see that G can be constructed by adding the standard Green's function on B3 its reflection over [formula]. It is also immediate to observe that

[formula]

Multiplying G on both sides of ([\ref=equ23]) and integrating by parts, we have

[formula]

Here ν represents the outer normal vector of the domain. Using h  ≤  0 and ∂νG  ≤  0, we have

[formula]

In particular take let u(x0) =  min ∂B+2u, then |x0| = 2, thus

[formula]

Therefore we have obtained the bound on [formula]. To obtain the bound on [formula], we use a cut-off function η which is 1 on B+1 and is 0 on [formula] and [formula]. Multiplying uη2 to both sides of ([\ref=equ23]) and using integration by parts and Cauchy inequality we obtain the desired bound on [formula]. Theorem [\ref=minorthm] is established. [formula]
