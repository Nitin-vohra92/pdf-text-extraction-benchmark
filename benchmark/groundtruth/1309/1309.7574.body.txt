Introduction

Let X be a Banach space, and let L(X) be the Banach algebra of all linear continuous operators on X. An operator A∈L(X) is called Fredholm if the range [formula] of the operator A is a closed subset of X and the null spaces ker A: = {x∈X:Ax = 0} and ker A*: = {h∈X*:A*h = 0} of the operator A and the adjoint operator A* are finite-dimensional. For the sake of convenience, the null space of the adjoint operator A* is called the cokernel of A and it is denoted by   A. Further, if an operator A∈L(X) is Fredholm, then the number where dim Y denotes the dimension of the linear space Y, is referred to as the index of the operator A.

The present paper is devoted to Toeplitz plus Hankel operators acting on the classical Hardy spaces. Note that the theory of Toeplitz and Hankel operators has a long and interesting history and is distinguished by exiting results and rich connections with many fields of mathematics, physics, statistical mechanics, and so on (see, for example, [\cite=BS] [\cite=Pe:2003]). Despite the fact that Toeplitz operators and Hankel operators are quite different in their nature, they are closely related to each other. No wonder that Toeplitz plus Hankel operators T(a) + H(b) have attracted great attention, as well. Some particular points of interest are Fredholm properties, index, and even the invertibility. This is caused not only by theoretical research but also by interesting and challenging problems which arise in applications and which can be described in terms of the operators mentioned. For example, Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators occur in scattering theory [\cite=MST:1992], whereas Toeplitz plus Hankel operators are used in the theory of random matrix ensembles [\cite=BCE:2010] [\cite=BE:2009]. In the latter case, an interesting class of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators T(a) + H(b) has been considered. This class is defined by the condition

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit circle equipped with counterclockwise orientation.

At present, there is a well-developed Fredholm theory dealing for Toeplitz plus Hankel operators with piecewise continuous generating functions acting on various Banach and Hilbert spaces. For more detailed information the reader can consult [\cite=BS], [\cite=RSS2011], [\cite=RS1990], and [\cite=RS:2012]. The latter paper also contains a transparent index formula for the operators acting on the space [formula]. The ideas of that work, with a necessary adjustment, can also be used to obtain similar formulas for operators acting on Hardy spaces Hp. It is worth noting that contrary to scalar Toeplitz operators, Fredholm Toeplitz plus Hankel operators are not necessarily one-sided invertible. In a sense, their behaviour is similar to the behaviour of block Toeplitz operators. Let us recall that the kernel and cokernel dimension of a block Toeplitz operator acting on Hp spaces can be expressed via partial indices of the Wiener-Hopf factorization of the corresponding generating matrix. However, as a matter of fact, for an arbitrary matrix-function there is no efficient procedure in order to obtain its Wiener-Hopf factorization. On the other hand, for Toeplitz plus Hankel operators acting on the Hardy spaces Hp, there is a general result [\cite=Ehr:2004h] [\cite=E2004] stating that T(a) + H(b):Hp  →  Hp, a,b∈L∞ is Fredholm if and only if the matrix-function where [formula], admits a certain type of antisymmetric factorization. Moreover, the defect numbers dim  ker (T(a) + H(b)) and dim   (T(a) + H(b)) of the operator T(a) + H(b) can be expressed via partial indices of the antisymmetric factorization of the matrix V(a,b). Nevertheless, for arbitrary functions a,b∈L∞ the chances of finding such a factorization and the corresponding partial indices are very slight. However, if the generating functions of the operator T(a) + H(b) satisfy the additional condition [\eqref=eq1.1], the matrix V(a,b) takes the form where [formula] and [formula]. Thus V(a,b) becomes a triangular matrix, which is better suited for factorization theory. These ideas have been used while considering Toeplitz plus Hankel operators of the form T(a) + H(at- 1) (see [\cite=Ehr:2004h]). On the other hand, the study of the operators T(a) + H(a) in [\cite=BE2004] [\cite=BE2006] does not involve the factorization of the matrix V(a,a). Recently, a new method to investigate the operators T(a) + H(b):Hp  →  Hp with piecewise continuous generating functions a and b satisfying condition [\eqref=eq1.1] has been proposed [\cite=BE:2013]. This method is based on the antisymmetric factorization of the scalar functions c and d- 1 and it leads to a complete description of Fredholm properties of the operators under consideration, including the computation of the corresponding defect numbers. In particular, it is shown that the operator T(a) + H(b) is Fredholm if and only if the functions c and d- 1 can be represented in a special form. Similar problems have been studied in [\cite=DS:2013d], but the approach of [\cite=DS:2013d] differs from [\cite=BE:2013] and does not employ any factorization theory in the defect number computation. Still, very often it is not enough to have an information about Fredholmness and index but more specific results concerning the kernel and cokernel of the corresponding operator are required. Thus one of the aims of the present work is to obtain an effective description of the kernels and cokernels of the operators in question.

In view of this, let us mention paper [\cite=KLR:2009] which is the culmination of the development aimed at Fredholmness and which contains a description of kernels and cokernels of singular integral operators with some Carleman backward shifts. Although the shifts in [\cite=KLR:2009] are slightly different from that appearing in Hankel operators, the approach of [\cite=KLR:2009] is also based on Wiener-Hopf factorization of 2  ×  2 matrix functions. It is also worth noting that the corresponding factorization is assumed to have factorization factors with entries from L∞. Such an assumption implies that the corresponding operator is Fredholm on any space Lp, 1 < p <   ∞  , if and only if it is Fredholm on one single space, say on L2. Besides, it turns out that most piecewise continuous generating functions are not covered by this method.

The approach used in the present paper is completely different from both [\cite=BE:2013] and [\cite=KLR:2009]. For example, we try to avoid Wiener-Hopf factorization techniques as long as possible. Thus in Section [\ref=s3], assuming only the right invertibility of the operator T(c), c = ab- 1 we give a description of the kernels of the operators T(a)  ±  H(b) for a,b∈L∞. Moreover, we show which parts of the kernels of the operators T(c), c = ab- 1 and T(d), [formula] make a contribution to the kernels of the operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b). More precisely, there are decompositions of the kernels of the operators T(c) and T(d) describing these parts. It is remarkable that Fredholmness of the operator T(a) plays no role in our considerations. In Section [\ref=s4], some operators of the form T(a)  ±  H(tka), a∈L∞, k =  - 1,0,1 are considered. It is shown that for such operators a version of Coburn-Simonenko theorem holds. In particular, Fredholmness of these operators implies their one-sided invertibility. Note that the proof of these results does not use any factorization arguments. Therefore, such an approach can also be used for similar Toeplitz plus Hankel operators with discontinuous generating functions acting on lp-spaces, where factorization technique is not available. However, to tell the truth, in Sections [\ref=s5] and [\ref=s6] we use factorizations of certain scalar functions. But these factorizations are only used in order to obtain bases for the subspaces participating in the decompositions mentioned. Such an approach gives a complete description for the structure of the null spaces of the operators T(a)  ±  H(b) and allows us to determine their dimensions. For this purpose, we introduce a characteristic of the factorization for functions g∈L∞ satisfying the condition [formula] and such that T(g) is Fredholm. It is called factorization signature and takes values + 1 and - 1. Similar parameters occur in literature from time to time, but it seems that their importance is not truly appreciated so far. In Section [\ref=s5] we also provide sufficient conditions which make possible an easy computation of the factorization signature. For piecewise continuous generating functions, a very simple formula for the factorization signature is established in Section [\ref=s8]. Section [\ref=s6] is devoted to the description of the kernels and cokernels of the operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b), a,b∈L∞ in the case where operators T(c) and T(d) are Fredholm. The latter condition implies Fredholmness of the operators T(a)  ±  H(b) and allows one to get their indices. This section also provides some results for the operators T(a)  ±  H(b) under additional assumption that [formula] and the factorization signature is equal to one. This generalizes the corresponding results of Section [\ref=s4]. Section [\ref=s7] is specified to the case of piecewise continuous generating functions.

The present paper has some intersection with the recent paper [\cite=BE:2013] but our approach is entirely different and leads to more general and more detailed results with an additional advantage that the kernel and cokernel of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators are completely described.

Spaces and operators

Let us introduce some operators and spaces we need. As usual, let [formula] stand for the C*-algebra of all essentially bounded Lebesgue measurable functions on [formula], and let [formula], 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞   denote the Banach space of all Lebesgue measurable functions f such that

[formula]

is finite. Further, let [formula] and [formula] refer to the Hardy spaces of all functions f∈Lp the Fourier coefficients of which vanish for all n < 0 and n > 0, respectively. It is a classical result that for p∈(1,  ∞  ) the Riesz projection P defined by is bounded on the space Lp and its range is the whole space Hp. The operator Q: = I - P, is also a projection and its range is a subspace of the codimension one in [formula].

We also consider the flip operator J:Lp  ↦  Lp, where the bar denotes the complex conjugation. Note that the operator J changes the orientation, satisfies the relations and for any a∈L∞, Further, for any a∈L∞ consider an operator T(a):Hp  ↦  Hp, 1 < p <   ∞   defined by The operator T(a) is obviously bounded and where cp is the norm of the Riesz projection on Lp. This operator is called Toeplitz operator generated by the function a. Toeplitz operators with matrix-valued generating functions acting on Hp  ×  Hp are defined similarly.

For a∈L∞, the Hankel operator H(a):Hp  ↦  Hp, 1 < p <   ∞   is defined by It is clear that this operator is also bounded, that is

[formula]

with the same constant cp as in [\eqref=eqB]. However, in contrast to Toeplitz operators, the corresponding generating function a is not uniquely defined by the operator itself. Further, if a belongs to the space of all continuous functions [formula], then the Hankel operator H(a) is compact on the space Hp. Moreover, Hankel operators are never Fredholm, whereas if a Toeplitz operator T(a):Hp  →  Hp is Fredholm, then T(a) is one-sided invertible.

Let [formula]. Recall that in the natural basis [formula] of the space Hp, 1 < p <   ∞  , Toeplitz and Hankel operators with generating function a∈L∞ can be, respectively, represented as infinite matrices (âk - j)∞k,j = 0 and (âk + j + 1)∞k,j = 0, where âk is the k-th Fourier coefficient of the function a. In this form, Toeplitz and Hankel operators appear on the spaces [formula] (see [\cite=BS]). However, the study of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators on the space [formula] is much more difficult since it is connected with the multiplier problem.

Let us also recall some other results concerning Toeplitz plus Hankel operators. Thus, if T(a) + H(b)∈L(Hp), then the adjoint operator acts on the space Hq, p- 1 + q- 1 = 1 and

[formula]

Suppose now that a belongs to the group GL∞ of invertible elements from L∞ and

[formula]

This relation plays an important role in what follows. It is called the matching condition, and if a and b satisfy [\eqref=eq2.1], then the duo (a,b) is called the matching pair. For each matching pair (a,b) one can assign another matching pair (c,d), where c = ab- 1 and [formula]. Such a pair (c,d) is called the subordinated pair for (a,b), and it is easily seen that the functions which constitutes a subordinated pair have a specific property, namely [formula]. In passing note that these functions c and d can also be expressed in the form Besides, if (c,d) is the subordinated pair for a matching pair (a,b), then [formula] is the subordinated pair for the matching pair [formula] defining the adjoint operator (see [\eqref=eq2.0]). Further, a matching pair (a,b) is called Fredholm, if the Toeplitz operators T(c) and T(d) are Fredholm.

In the following, any function g∈L∞ satisfying the condition is called matching function.

If a,b∈L∞, then the following relations hold:

If (a,b) is a matching pair with the subordinated pair (c,d), then (at- n,btn) is a matching pair with the subordinated pair (ct- 2n,d).

If [formula], then

[formula]

Proof. Assertion (i) can be verified straightforward, and equation [\eqref=eq2.2] is a consequence of the well-known identities and the relation H(tn)T(tn) = 0.

Recall that a is assumed to be invertible in L∞ and let us point out that this is always the case when the operator T(a) + H(b) is Fredholm [\cite=BE:2013] [\cite=E2004]. On the other hand, the invertibility of a∈L∞ does not automatically implies the Fredholmness either of the operators T(a) + H(b) or T(a). Nevertheless, Fredholm properties of Toeplitz operators T(a) can be described by using the Wiener-Hopf factorization of the generating function a. Assume that p > 1, q > 1 are real numbers such that p- 1 + q- 1 = 1.

We say that a function a∈L∞ admits a week Wiener-Hopf factorization in Hp, if it can be represented in the form

[formula]

where [formula], a+∈Hq, a- 1+∈Hp, [formula], [formula], and a-(  ∞  ) = 1.

It is well-known that the weak Wiener-Hopf factorization of a function a is unique, if it exists. The functions a- and a+ are called the factorization factors, and the number n is the factorization index. If a∈L∞ and the operator T(a) is Fredholm, then the function a admits the weak Wiener-Hopf factorization with [formula] [\cite=BS] [\cite=LiSp:1987]. Moreover, in this case, the factorization factors possess an additional property-viz. the linear operator a- 1+Pa- 1-I defined on [formula] can be boundedly extended on the whole space Hp. Throughout this paper, such a kind of weak Wiener-Hopf factorization in Hp is called simply Wiener-Hopf factorization in Hp. Note that if h is a polynomial, then the element Pa- 1-h is also a polynomial. The following result is well-known.

If a∈L∞, then Toeplitz operator T(a):Hp  →  Hp, 1 < p <   ∞   is Fredholm and [formula] if and only if the generating function a admits the Wiener-Hopf factorization [\eqref=fac] in Hp.

Recall that Fredholmness of a Toeplitz operator depends on the space where this operator acts. The reader can consult [\cite=BS] [\cite=LiSp:1987] for more details. Another important result is given by Coburn-Simonenko theorem stating that if a is the non-zero element in L∞, then the kernel or cokernel of the operator T(a) is trivial. Block Toeplitz operators does not possess such a property and this causes serious difficulties. For Toeplitz plus Hankel operators situation is similar to block Toeplitz operators. Therefore, the determination of the numbers dim  ker (T(a) + H(b)) and dim   (T(a) + H(b)) becomes a challenging problem, and one of the aims of this work is to find them for some classes of the operators T(a) + H(b). In conclusion of this section, let us recall that one-sided inverses of a Fredholm scalar Toeplitz operator T(a) can be effectively derived. Let n be the factorization index. If n  ≥  0, then T(a) is left-invertible and the operator T(t- n)T- 1(a0), where a0: = at- n, is one of the left-inverses for T(a). On the other hand, if [formula], then T(a) is right-invertible. For the sake of convenience, in this paper the notation T- 1r(a) always means the operator T- 1(a0)T(t- n), which is one of right inverses for the operator T(a). Besides, for n > 0 the kernel of the operator T(t- n) is the linear span of the monomials [formula], i.e. [formula].

If T(a) is right-invertible and dim  ker T(a) =   ∞  , then T- 1r(a) denotes one of right inverses of T(a).

Kernels of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators

Let a,b∈L∞. On the space Hp, 1 < p <   ∞   consider Toeplitz plus Hankel operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b). As was already mentioned, in the present paper, the kernel spaces of these operators are studied under the additional condition [\eqref=eq2.1], connecting the generating functions a and b. This condition presents a unique possibility to obtain an effective description for the kernels of the operators T(a)  ±  H(b). Nevertheless, let us start with an auxiliary result for Toeplitz plus Hankel operators with arbitrary generating functions a,b∈L∞. By V = V(a,b) we denote the matrix where [formula], [formula]. As usual, it is assumed that the element [formula] is invertible. In particular, this condition is satisfied if at least one of the operators T(a) + H(b) or T(a) - H(b) is Fredholm [\cite=BE:2013] [\cite=E2004].

Our first concern here is to introduce a formula which is known in principle - viz.

[formula]

where A,B:Lp  ×  Lp  →  Lp  ×  Lp are invertible operators, and A is also known but its concrete form is not important right now. Note that in the following we frequently denote the operator aI of multiplication by the function a∈L∞ simply by a.

In order to establish formula [\eqref=eqTV], let us recall some well known operator identities and relations connecting Toeplitz plus Hankel operators with block Toeplitz operators. Thus if a belongs to a unital Banach algebra with the identity e and if p is an idempotent from the same algebra, i.e. p2 = p, then

[formula]

where q = e - p, and e - paq is the inverse for the element e + paq.

On the other hand, one can write (see, for example, [\cite=DS:2012a] [\cite=Kr:1987])

[formula]

Setting [formula], [formula] and using [\eqref=eqn1] one can rewrite the relation [\eqref=eqn3] as

[formula]

In the relation [\eqref=idt], all the operators connecting the operator [formula] and the operator are invertible and Thus the representation [\eqref=eqTV] is established.

Relation [\eqref=eqTV] indicates that the operators [formula] and T(V(a,b)) are simultaneously Fredholm. However, this conclusion is not always true for the operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) themselves. Examples can be already found among the operators I  ±  H(b) with piecewise continuous generating functions (see, for example, [\cite=DS:2012a]). Even if both operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) are Fredholm, they can have different indices. Thus, in general, the use of relation [\eqref=eqTV] in the study of Fredholm properties of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators is limited. Nevertheless, this relation is still very helpful in the investigation of the kernels of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators.

Assume that a,b∈L∞, a∈GL∞, and the operators T(a)  ±  H(b) are considered on the space Hp, 1 < p <   ∞  . Then

If (φ,ψ)T∈ ker T(V(a,b)), then

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

Moreover, the operators

[formula]

defined, respectively, by the relations [\eqref=eqKer1] and [\eqref=eqKer2] are mutually inverses to each other.

Proof. Consider the representation [\eqref=eqTV] and note that both operators A and B are invertible on the space [formula]. Therefore, relation [\eqref=eqTV] implies that for any (φ,ψ)T∈ ker T(V(a,b))), the element B- 1((φ,ψ)T) belongs to the set Hence Computing the left-hand side of the last equation, one obtains the relation [\eqref=eqKer1]. Analogously, if [formula], then B((Φ,Ψ)T)∈ ker T(V(a,b)) and so the representation [\eqref=eqKer2] follows.

Now let (φ,ψ) and (Φ,Ψ) be as above. Then

[formula]

which completes the proof.

From now on we also assume that the generating functions a,b∈L∞ satisfy matching conditions [\eqref=eq2.1]. If this is the case, the kernels of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) can be studied in more detail.

Note that if (a,b) is a matching pair, then the matrix-function V(a,b) takes the form where (c,d) is the corresponding subordinated pair. In addition, we also have a useful representation-viz.

[formula]

where the operator in the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq3] is invertible and

Now we can establish a representation for the kernel of the block Toeplitz operator T(V(a,b)).

Let (a,b)∈L∞  ×  L∞ be a matching pair such that the operator T(c), c = ab- 1, is invertible from the right. Then where

[formula]

Proof. It is easily seen that Ω(c) and (d) are closed subspaces of the kernel of the operator T(V(a,b)). It is also clear that the intersection of this two subspaces consists of the zero vector only.

If (y1,y2)T∈ ker T(V(a,b)), then Since T- 1r(c) is left-invertible, the space Hp can be represented as the direct sum of the closed subspaces ker T(c) and [formula], i.e. Correspondingly, the element y1 can be written as y1 = y10 + y11, where y10∈ ker T(c) and [formula]. Moreover, there is a unique vector y3∈Hp such that y11 = T- 1r(c)y3, so we get It implies that and we get with [formula] and (y10,0)T∈Ω(c), which completes the proof.

We already know that if an element [formula] belongs to the kernel of the operator T(c), then (φ,0)T∈ ker T(V(a,b)) and Lemma [\ref=l1] implies that

[formula]

However, it is remarkable that the functions φ - JQcPφ and φ + JQcPφ belong to the kernel of the operator T(c) as well.

Let g∈L∞ satisfy the relation [formula]. Then

If f∈ ker T(g), then JQgPf∈ ker T(g).

If f∈ ker T(g), then (JQgP)2f = f.

Proof. If [formula] and f∈ ker T(g), then and assertion (i) follows. On the other hand, for any f∈ ker T(g) one has

[formula]

and we are done.

Consider now the operator [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=p1], one has [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, on the space ker T(g) the operators [formula] are complimentary projections, so they generate a decomposition of ker T(g).

Let (c,d) be the subordinated pair for a matching pair (a,b)∈L∞  ×  L∞. Then the following relations

[formula]

hold.

Corollary [\ref=c1] shows the influence of the operator T(c) on the kernels of the operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b). Let us now clarify the role of another operator-viz. the operator T(d), in the kernel structure of the corresponding operators T(a)  ±  H(b). This problem is more involved. Assume additionally that the operator T(c) is invertible from the right. If s∈ ker T(d), then the element [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l1], the element

[formula]

belongs to the null space ker (T(a)  ±  H(b)) of the corresponding operator T(a)  ±  H(b).

The map s  ↦  φ±(s) is a one-to-one function from the space [formula] to the space ker (T(a)  ±  H(b)).

Proof. Assume that s∈ ker T(d). If we show that the operator [formula] sends φ+(s) into [formula] and the operator [formula] sends φ-(s) into [formula], then Lemma [\ref=l2] will follow. Consider, for example, the first case. Thus one has where

[formula]

Taking into account that [formula], bc = a, JPJ = Q, [formula] and P + Q = I, we get

[formula]

which implies the relation

[formula]

Further,

[formula]

and consequently

[formula]

Comparing [\eqref=eq4] and [\eqref=eq5], one obtains the claim for the function φ+(s). The case of function φ-(s) is considered analogously.

Let (c,d) be the subordinated pair for a matching pair (a,b)∈L∞  ×  L∞. If the operator T(c) is right-invertible, then

[formula]

Proof. As was mentioned in the proof of Lemma [\ref=l2], for s∈ ker T(d) one has

[formula]

On the other hand, if s∈ ker T(c), then and it is easily seen that

[formula]

Using these relations one can observe that if [formula], then and if [formula], then Thus But E2 is an isomorphism, hence and it is clear that [formula] and [formula] are closed subspaces of ker (T(a) + H(b)). Moreover, the direct sum of [formula] and [formula] is a closed subspace. In order to show that [formula] is ker (T(a) + H(b)) we have to show that for [formula], the element φ+(s) belongs to Y. Thus assume that [formula] and consider the element By Proposition [\ref=p3.4], we have φ+(s)∈ ker T(c). Moreover, [formula] since otherwise E1((φ+(s),0)T)∉ ker (T(a) + H(b)), which is a contradiction.

The related result for ker (T(a) - H(b)) can be proved analogously.

Despite the fact that all results of this section are formulated for operators acting on Hp-spaces, they remain true for Toeplitz plus Hankel operators on [formula] and for Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators on [formula], 1  ≤  p <   ∞  .

Coburn-Simonenko theorem for particular classes of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators

Coburn-Simonenko theorem for Toeplitz operators claims that if a∈L∞ and is different from the zero element, then

[formula]

It turns out that, in general, such a statement for the operators T(a) + H(b), a,b∈L∞ is not true. Nevertheless, the results of Section [\ref=s3] allow one to single out certain classes of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators where some kind of Coburn-Simonenko theorem still remains in force.

Let aj∈GL∞, j = 1,2,3,4 and let A refer to one of the four operators T(a1) - H(a1t- 1), T(a2) + H(a2t), T(a3) + H(a3), T(a4) - H(a4). Then ker A = 0 or   A = 0.

Proof. Let us start with the operator T(a2) + H(ta2). The duo (a2,ta2) constitutes a matching pair with the subordinated pair (t- 1,d), where [formula]. Note that the constant function [formula], [formula], belongs to both spaces ker T(t- 1) and ker (T(a2) - H(a2t)). Suppose now that dim  ker T(d) > 0. By Proposition [\ref=c2], we get that Moreover, Coburn-Simonenko theorem gives that Factorization [\eqref=eq3] entails that the cokernel of T(V(a2,a2t)) is trivial. By [\eqref=eqTV] the cokernel of the diagonal operator [formula] is also trivial, and hence so is the cokernel of T(a2) + H(a2t). On the other hand, if dim  ker T(d) = 0, we again can use Proposition [\ref=c2] to conclude that Consider now the operator T(a1) - H(t- 1a1). The representation [\eqref=eq2.2] implies that

[formula]

Setting a2: = a1t- 1, one rewrites the first operator in the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq4.1] as But the operators of the form T(a2) - H(a2t) have been already considered. In particular, the element [formula] belongs to the kernel of the operator T(a2) - H(a2t). Now let ker T(d) = {0}. Since [formula], the relation [\eqref=eq4.1] implies that Now let dim  ker T(d) > 0. Then and

[formula]

Note that the functions [formula] can be rewritten as where 0 is the zero Fourier coefficient of the function s. We have [formula], so if [formula], then [formula], and using [\eqref=eq4.1] we get

[formula]

The remaining operators T(a3) + H(a3) and T(a4) - H(a4) can be considered analogously.

If the conditions of Theorem [\ref=t2.1] are satisfied and if, in addition, some of the corresponding operators is generalized invertible, then it is one sided invertible.

Recall that if a linear operator is Fredholm, then it is generalized invertible.

All of the above operators have been previously considered in literature [\cite=BE2004] [\cite=BE2006] [\cite=Ehr:2004h]. Nevertheless, the proofs presented here are essentially simpler and the results of Theorem [\ref=t2.1] and Corollary [\ref=c9] are more general.

Of course, now one can ask how the operators T(a1) + H(a1t- 1) and T(a2) - H(a2t) behave. For such operators, the situation is more complicated and the assertion of Theorem [\ref=t2.1] remains valid only under additional assumptions. Consider for instance the operator T(a1) + H(a1t- 1) which was previously studied in [\cite=Ehr:2004h] in case of piecewise continuous function a. Analogously to the proof of Theorem [\ref=t2.1] we set a2 = a1t- 1 and represent this operator as the product of two operators,

[formula]

We already know that ker T(t- 1) does not affect the kernel of the operator T(a2) + H(a2t). Indeed, one has [formula] and [formula] and Proposition [\ref=c2] implies the claim. If ker T(d) = {0}, then using Proposition [\ref=c2] once more we obtain that ker (T(a2) + H(a2t)) = {0} and therefore ker (T(a1) + H(a1t- 1)) = {0}. Assume now that dim  ker T(d) > 0. By Proposition [\ref=c2], one has [formula]. Moreover,   (T(a2) + H(a2t)) = {0} as it was shown in Theorem [\ref=t2.1]. For the sake of simplicity, suppose now that T(a2) + H(a2t) is an onto operator. If [formula], then dim   (T(a1) + H(a1t- 1)) = 1. If [formula], then T(a1) + H(a1t- 1) has non-trivial kernel and cokernel. If ker (T(a2) + H(a2t) is not contained in [formula], we have   (T(a1) + H(a1t- 1)) = {0}, the proof of which is similar to the proof of the assertion   (T(a1) - H(a1t- 1)) = {0} in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t2.1].

It is worth noting that the study of the operator T(a1) + H(a1t- 1) in [\cite=Ehr:2004h] is more involved and lengthy.

The results of this section are also valid for related bounded Toeplitz plus Hankel operators considered on [formula]. The case of Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel integral operators requires more work and will be published elsewhere.

Kernel decomposition for a class of Toeplitz operators

In this section we establish certain properties of the kernels of Toeplitz operators which are needed in what follows. More precisely, we present the kernel decomposition for Fredholm Toeplitz operators T(g) with symbols g∈L∞ satisfying the relation [formula]. As we already know (see Corollary [\ref=c1]), the kernel of the operator T(g) can be represented in the form It turns out that the spaces [formula] and [formula] possess nice bases and this fact is actively used in the forthcoming sections. In particular, the dimensions of the subspaces [formula] and [formula] can be determined.

If the operator T(g):Hp  →  Hp is Fredholm, then by Theorem [\ref=t1], the function g admits a Wiener-Hopf factorization g = g-tng+ in Hp. Recall that g-(  ∞  ) = 1.

Let g∈L∞ be a function satisfying the condition [formula] and such that the operator T(g):Hp  →  Hp is Fredholm. Then

[formula]

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the index of T(g) is equal to 0, so the operator T(g) is invertible on Hp. By [\cite=BS], the operator [formula] is invertible on Hq, p- 1 + q- 1 = 1. Then the function [formula] admits Wiener-Hopf factorization in Hq, It follows that

[formula]

Note that the left-hand side of [\eqref=eqH] belongs to the space [formula] whereas the right-hand side is in [formula]. Taking into account the relation [formula], one obtains that there is a constant [formula] such that so Moreover, recalling the identities g-(  ∞  ) = g- 1-(  ∞  ) = 1 and [formula] and [formula] we get g+(0) = ξ and ξ2 = 1, which implies [\eqref=eqPM].

Let g∈L∞ satisfy the condition [formula] and admit the Wiener-Hopf factorization g = g-tng+, g-(  ∞  ) = 1 in Hp. The value g+(0) is called the factorization signature of the function g and is denoted by [formula].

If g∈L∞ is a matching function such that the operator T(g) is Fredholm, then the factors g- and g+ in the related Wiener-Hopf factorization of g satisfy the relations

[formula]

Indeed, these relations immediately follow from the proof of Proposition [\ref=p2].

The following result plays a crucial role in this paper.

Let g∈L∞ be a matching function such that the operator T(g):Hp  →  Hp is Fredholm and [formula]. If g = g-t- ng+, g-(  ∞  ) = 1 is the corresponding Wiener-Hopf factorization of g in Hp, then the following systems of functions B±(g) form bases in the spaces [formula]:

If n = 2m, [formula], then and

If n = 2m + 1, [formula], then and the zero element belongs only to one of the sets B+(g) or B-(g). Namely, for k = 0 one of the terms [formula] is equal to zero.

Proof. It is easily seen that the restriction of the operators Pg-I and Pg- 1-I on [formula] map ker T(t- n) into ker T(t- n) and on the space ker T(t- n) the above operators are inverses to each other.

Clearly, the elements sj = Pg-tj, [formula] are again in ker T(t- n) and where g0: = gtn.

Note that T- 1(g0) = g- 1+Pg- 1- and T- 1(g0)sj∈ ker T(g). Moreover, the set [formula] constitutes a basis in ker T(g). Now one can consider the expression

[formula]

Corollary [\ref=c3] shows that [formula], which leads to the relation

Now let n = 2m, [formula]. If [formula], then this j can be written as j = m - k - 1 with some [formula] and vice versa. Hence On the other hand, if j  ≥  m, then j can be rewritten as j = m + k for a [formula], and [formula]. Thus one obtains, maybe up to the factor - 1, the same function system that was found for [formula]. So we conclude that if n = 2m, then and assertion (i) is shown. Assertion (ii) can be proved similarly.

Let us emphasize that, in general, the determination of the factorization signature [formula], g∈L∞ is a difficult problem. Nevertheless, we can provide sufficient conditions which allow one to obtain [formula]. Note that if g∈L∞ is continuous at the points [formula], then the function g can take only two values - 1 or 1 at the points mentioned, i.e. g( - 1),g(1)∈{ - 1,1}.

Let g∈L∞ be a matching function such that

The operator T(g) is invertible on Hp.

The function g is continuous at the point 1 or - 1.

Then [formula] or [formula], respectively.

Proof. Assume for definiteness that the function g is continuous at the point 1. Then it admits a Wiener-Hopf factorization in Hp, and g(1) =   ±  1. By Corollary [\ref=c3] one has Approximate the function g as follows. For a given ε > 0 chose an arc of [formula] with endpoints eiξ0 and e- iξ0 such that the point 1 belongs to this arc and such that the function satisfies the condition If ε is small enough, then the operator T(gε) is also invertible and

[formula]

Since gε is Hölder continuous in a neighbourhood of the point 1, [\cite=LiSp:1987] shows that the functions (gε)+ and [formula] are also Hölder continuous in a neighbourhood of the point [formula]. From relation [\eqref=AF] one then obtains Additionally assume that ε is so small that

[formula]

The equations T(g)h = 1 and T(gεk = 1 are uniquely solvable and using Wiener-Hopf factorizations

[formula]

one obtains

[formula]

where [formula] is the constant function [formula], [formula]. Now the inequality [\eqref=Eq1] implies the estimate Consequently, equations [formula], [formula] lead to the relation g- 1+(0) = (gε)- 1+, i.e. [formula]. Hence, which completes the proof.

Let g∈L∞ be a matching function satisfying condition (ii) of Proposition [\ref=p3]. If the operator T(g):Hp  →  Hp is Fredholm and [formula], then [formula] if g is continuous at the point 1 and [formula].

If n is even, then [formula] if g is continuous at the point - 1.

Toeplitz plus Hankel operators with Fredholm matching pair

In this section the structure of the kernel and cokernel of Toeplitz plus Hankel operator T(a) + H(b) is described. The operators in question are studied under the condition that their generating functions a,b∈L∞ constitute a Fredholm matching pair (a,b). Recall that if a matching pair (a,b) is Fredholm, then it follows from [\eqref=eqTV] and [\eqref=eq3] that T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) are Fredholm operators. Set [formula], [formula] and let [formula] refer to the set of all negative integers.

Assume that (a,b)∈L∞  ×  L∞ is a Fredholm matching pair. Then

If [formula], then the operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) are invertible from the right and

[formula]

where the spaces [formula] and [formula] are described in Theorem [\ref=t2], and the mappings φ± are defined by [\eqref=eqphi].

If [formula], then the operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) are invertible from the left and

[formula]

and [formula] for κ2 = 0.

If [formula], then

[formula]

Proof. Let us note that all results concerning the kernels of the operators mentioned follow from Theorem [\ref=t2]. Considering the cokernels of the corresponding operators, we recall that   (T(a)  ±  H(b)): =  ker (T(a)  ±  H(b))*. Moreover, [formula] and [formula] is again a matching pair with the subordinated pair [formula]. Further, if c = c-t-  κ1c+ is the Wiener-Hopf factorization of c in Hp, then [formula] is the related Wiener-Hopf factorization of [formula] in Hq and [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], p- 1 + q- 1 = 1, and [formula]. Of course, since the function [formula] admits a similar factorization, cokernel description can be obtained directly from the previous results for the kernels of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators.

It remains to consider the case [formula]. This situation is more involved and factorization [\eqref=eq3] already indicates that for κ2 > 0, the kernel dimension of [formula] may be smaller than κ2. In order to prepare our next theorem, choose an [formula] such that Such an n is uniquely defined and Now the operators T(a)  ±  H(b) can be represented in the form

[formula]

Note that (at- n,btn) is a matching pair with the subordinated pair (ct- 2n,d). Therefore, the operators T(at- n)  ±  H(btn) are subject to assertion (i) of Theorem [\ref=t3]. Thus they are right-invertible, and if κ1 is even, then

[formula]

and if κ1 is odd, then

[formula]

where the mappings φ± depend on the functions at- n and btn.

Let [formula]. Then

If κ1 is odd, then

[formula]

where [formula] are the Fourier coefficients of the function u, and the mappings φ± depend on the functions at- n and btn.

If κ1 is even, then

[formula]

and the mappings φ± again depend on at- n and btn.

Proof. It follows immediately from representations [\eqref=eq6.1]-[\eqref=eq6.3].

Theorem [\ref=t4] can also be used to derive representations of the cokernel of the operator T(a)  ±  H(b) in the situation where [formula]. Indeed, recalling that [formula], and [formula] is the subordinated pair for [formula], one can note that the operators [formula] and [formula] are also Fredholm and so [formula]. Therefore, Theorem [\ref=t4] applies and we can formulate the following result.

Let [formula], and let [formula] satisfy the requirement Then

If κ2 is odd, then

If κ2 is even, then

[formula]

and the mappings φ± depend on [formula] and [formula].

In some cases the above approach allows one to drop the condition of Fredholmness of the operator T(d). We are not going to pursue this analysis here but rather restrict ourselves to a few special cases generalizing results of Section [\ref=s4].

Let (a,b)∈L∞  ×  L∞ be a matching pair with the subordinated pair (c,d), and let T(c) be a Fredholm operator. Then:

If [formula] and [formula], then ker (T(a) + H(b)) = {0} or   (T(a) + H(b)) = {0}.

If [formula] and [formula], then ker (T(a) - H(b)) = {0} or   (T(a) - H(b)) = {0}.

If [formula], then ker (T(a)  ±  H(b)) = {0} or   (T(a)  ±  H(b)) = {0}.

Proof. The proof of the last theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=t2], but in the proofs of assertions (i) and (ii) one, respectively, has to use the fact that c- 1+∈ ker (T(a) + H(b)) and c- 1+∈ ker (T(at- 1) - H(bt)). These inclusions can be verified by straightforward computations. Thus considering, for example, the expression (T(at- 1) - H(bt))c- 1+, one obtains

[formula]

Note that we have used the relations a = bc and [formula].

Let b∈L∞ be a matching function. If [formula] is a Fredholm operator, then:

If [formula], and [formula], then ker (I + H(b)) or   (I + H(b)) is trivial.

If [formula], and [formula], then ker (I - H(b)) or   (I - H(b)) is trivial.

If [formula], then ker (I  ±  H(b)) or   (I  ±  H(b)) is trivial.

This results is a direct consequence of Corollary [\ref=c5], since if b is a matching function, then (1,b) is a matching pair with the subordinate pair [formula].

PC-generating functions

The results of the previous section can be improved if there is more information available about the generating functions a and b. Thus if a and b are piecewise continuous functions, then one-sided invertibility of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators on the space Hp, 1 < p <   ∞   can be studied in more detail. Recall that a function a∈L∞ is called piecewise continuous if for every [formula] the one-sided limits a(t + 0) and a(t - 0) exist. The set of all piecewise continuous functions is denoted by [formula] or simply by PC. It is well-known that PC is a closed subalgebra of L∞, and any piecewise continuous function has at most countable set of jumps. Moreover, for each δ > 0 the set [formula] is finite.

Further, let us introduce the functions

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] refers to the two-point compactification of [formula]. Note that for given points [formula], u  ≠  w the set [formula] forms a circular arc which starts at u and ends at w as y runs through [formula]. This arc Ap(u,w) has the property that from any point of the arc, the line segment

[formula]

.

Let [formula].

If a,b∈PC, then the operator T(a) + H(b) is Fredholm if and only if the matrix

[formula]

is invertible for every [formula] and the function

[formula]

does not vanish on [formula].

For the first time this theorem appeared in [\cite=RS1990] (see also [\cite=RSS2011]). An index formula can also be established similarly to [\cite=RS:2012]. If the matching condition is satisfied, an index formula can be derived from Theorem [\ref=t6] below.

If (a,b)∈PC  ×  PC is a matching pair, then the subordinated pair (c,d)∈PC  ×  PC, and both operators T(a) + H(b) and T(a) - H(b) are simultaneously Fredholm if and only if the matching pair (a,b) is Fredholm. This follows from the fact that semi-Fredholm Toeplitz operators with piecewise continuous generating functions are indeed Fredholm operators. This assertion can be obtained immediately from [\cite=GK1992a] and [\cite=Mu2003] and using [\eqref=eqTV] and [\eqref=eq3]. Let us mention another results we need.

Let A be an operator defined on all spaces Lp for 1 < p <   ∞  . Consider the set [formula].

The set AF is open. Moreover, for each connected component γ∈AF, the index of the operator A:Lp  →  Lp, p∈γ is constant.

For Toeplitz operators the structure of the set AF can be characterized as follows.

Let G be an invertible matrix-functions with entries from PC, and let A: = T(G). Then there is an at most countable subset SA  ⊂  (1,  ∞  ) with the only possible accumulation points t = 1 and t =   ∞   such that [formula].

This result can be used to describe the corresponding set AF for Toeplitz plus Hankel operators.

Let a,b∈PC, and let [formula]. Then there is at most countable subset SA  ⊂  (1,  ∞  ) with the only possible accumulation points t = 1 and t =   ∞   such that [formula].

Proof. It follows directly from Proposition [\ref=p5] since [formula] is Fredholm if and only if so is the operator T(V(a,b)).

Thus if a,b∈PC and the operator T(a) + H(b) is Fredholm on Hp, then there is an interval (p',p'') containing p such that T(a) + H(b) is Fredholm on all spaces Hr, r∈(p',p'') and the index of this operator does not depend on r. Moreover, there is an interval (p,p0)  ⊂  (p',p''), p < p0 such that T(a) - H(b) is Fredholm on Hr, r∈(p,p0) and its index does not depend on r. Now we can formulate the following result.

Let T(a) + H(b):Hp  →  Hp be a Fredholm operator and let r∈(p,p0). Then the kernel and cokernel of the operator T(a) + H(b):Hr  →  Hr coincide with the kernel and cokernel of the same operator acting on the space Hp.

Proof. Let us first recall a result from [\cite=GF1974]. Assume that X1,X2 are Banach spaces such that X1 is continuously and densely embedded into X2 and A is a linear bounded operator both on X1 and X2. If A is a Fredholm operator on each space X1 and X2, and

[formula]

then

[formula]

which implies the assertion.

Let us now formulate a result concerning the kernels and cokernels of Hankel plus Toeplitz operators.

Let a,b∈PC and (a,b) be a matching pair. If the operator T(a) + H(b):Hp  →  Hp is Fredholm, then there is an interval (p,p0), p < p0 such that for all r∈(p,p0) the pair (a,b) and both operators T(a)  ±  H(b):Hr  →  Hr are Fredholm, and the kernel and cokernel of the operator T(a) + H(b):Hr  →  Hr are described by Theorems [\ref=t3]-[\ref=t5].

Proof. It follows immediately from Proposition [\ref=p6] and previous considerations.

Let a,b∈L∞ be functions which possess the property fixed in Corollary [\ref=c7] for PC-functions. Then the results of Theorem [\ref=t6] remain true.

A few remarks on factorization signature

In previous sections the factorization signature has been used to describe the kernels of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators. Therefore, the determination of this characteristic is an important problem. Let us consider this problem for piecewise continuous matching functions c such that the operator T(c) is Fredholm. For the sake of definiteness we assume that if [formula] is a complex number, then its argument arg z is always chosen to be in the interval ( - π,π]. Following [\cite=BS], for [formula] and [formula] consider a function φβ,τ(t)∈PC defined by It is easily seen that φβ,τ has at most one discontinuity, namely, a jump at the point τ and From [\cite=BS] one obtains that:

The matching function c can be represented in one of the following form

[formula]

where the function c1,c2∈PC are continuous at the points t =  + 1 and t =  - 1, respectively; φγ+: = φγ+,1, φγ-: = φγ-, - 1, and the parameters γ+,γ- are defined according to [\cite=BS] with   γ+,  γ-∈( - 1 / q,1 / p) .

The operators T(φγ+) and T(φγ-) are invertible and the operators T(c1) and T(c2) are Fredholm.

It is not hard to see that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=p3] then ensures that

[formula]

Moreover, c1 and c2 are also matching functions and by Proposition [\ref=p3] and Corollary [\ref=c4] we have

[formula]

where [formula].

If c∈PC is a matching function which admits representation [\eqref=eq7.2], then

[formula]

Proof. Assume for definiteness that c = φγ+c1. Rewrite the function c1 in the form c1 = gt- n and approximate g by a function gε analogously to the corresponding function in the proof of Proposition [\ref=p3]. Recall that the operator T(g) is invertible and if ε is small enough, then

[formula]

where cε  =  φγ+gεtn. Indeed, it follows that the product of the "+"-factors of the Wiener-Hopf factorization of the factors in the representation of cε is the "+"-factor in the Wiener-Hopf factorization of cε (use [\cite=LiSp:1987]). It remains to show that for sufficiently small ε > 0 one has [formula] but this can be done analogously to the proof of Proposition [\ref=p3].
