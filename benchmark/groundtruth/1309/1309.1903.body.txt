Universal features in the photoemission spectroscopy of high temperature superconductors

Elucidating the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxide materials remains one of the most challenging open problems in physics. It has attracted the attention of scientists working in fields as diverse as materials science, condensed matter physics, cold atoms and string theory. To clearly define the problem of HTSCs, it is essential to establish which of the plethora of observed features are universal, namely, qualitatively unaffected by material-specific details.

An important early result concerns the universality of the symmetry of the order parameter for superconductivity. The order parameter was found to change sign under a [formula] rotation [\cite=DVH] [\cite=TSUI], which implies that the energy gap must vanish along the diagonal to the Cu-O bonds, i.e. the Brillouin zone diagonal. This sign change is consistent with early spectroscopic studies of near-optimally doped samples (those with the highest Tc in a given family), where a | cos 2φ| energy gap [\cite=SHEN] [\cite=DING] was observed (φ being the angle from the Cu-O bond direction), the simplest functional form consistent with d-wave pairing. More recently, there is considerable evidence [\cite=TANAKA] [\cite=Hufner] that, with underdoping, the anisotropy of the energy gap deviates markedly from the simple | cos 2φ| form. Although the gap node at [formula] is observed at all dopings, the gap near the antinode (near [formula] and [formula]) is significantly larger than that expected from the simplest d-wave form. Further, the large gap continues to persist in underdoped materials as the normal state pseudogap [\cite=Marshall] [\cite=Nat96] [\cite=Loeser] above Tc. This suggests that the small (near-nodal) and large (antinodal) gaps are of completely different origins, the former related to superconductivity and the latter to some other competing order parameter.

This "two-gap" picture has attracted much attention [\cite=Hufner], raising the possibility that multiple energy scales are involved in the HTSC problem. There is mounting evidence for additional broken symmetries [\cite=Kaminski] [\cite=Fauque] [\cite=HeRH2011] in underdoped cuprates, once superconductivity is weakened upon approaching the Mott insulating state. The central issue is the role of these additional order parameters in impacting the universal properties of high Tc superconductivity.

In this paper we use angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) to examine the universality of the "two-gap" scenario in HTSCs by addressing the following questions. To what extent are the observed deviations from a simple d-wave | cos 2φ| energy gap independent of material details? How does the observed gap anisotropy correlate, as a function of doping, with other spectroscopic features such as the size of the antinodal gap, and the spectral weights of the nodal and antinodal quasiparticle excitations?

We systematically examine the electronic spectra of various families of cation-substituted Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + δ single crystals as a function of carrier concentration to elucidate which properties are universal, and which are not. We present ARPES data on four families of float-zone grown Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + δ single crystals, where Tc was adjusted by both oxygen content and cation doping. As grown samples, labeled Bi2212, have an optimal Tc of 91K. These crystals were underdoped to Tc  =  55K by varying the oxygen content. Ca-rich crystals (grown from material with a starting composition Bi2.1Sr1.4Ca1.5Cu2O8 + δ) with an optimal Tc of 82K are labeled Ca. Two Dy-doped families were grown with starting compositions Bi2.1Sr1.9Ca1 - xDyxCu2O8 + δ with x  =   0.1 and 0.3 are labeled Dy1 and Dy2, respectively. A full list of the samples used and their Tc determined from magnetization measurements are shown in the supplementary information, where we also show high resolution X-ray data that give evidence for the excellent structural quality of our samples.

Our main result is that the Dy1 and Dy2 samples show clear evidence of a two-gap behavior in the underdoped (UD) regime [formula]K, with loss of coherent quasiparticles in the antinodal region of [formula]-space where the gap deviates from a simple d-wave form. In marked contrast, the UD Bi2212 samples and the Ca samples show a simple d-wave gap in the superconducting state and sharp quasiparticles over the entire Fermi surface in a similar Tc range of the underdoped regime. We conclude by discussing the implications of the non-universality of the two-gap behavior for the phenomenon of high Tc superconductivity.

We begin our comparison of the various families of samples by focusing in Fig. 1 on the superconducting state antinodal spectra as a function of underdoping. The antinode is the Fermi momentum kF on the (π,0)  -  (π,π) Brillouin zone boundary, where the energy gap is a maximum and, as we shall see, the differences between the various samples are the most striking. We show data at optimal doping, corresponding to the highest Tc in each family, in Fig. 1(a). Increasing Dy leads to a small suppression of the optimal Tc compared to Bi2212, together with an increase in the antinodal gap Δmax and a significant reduction of the quasiparticle weight. This trend continues down to moderate underdoping, as seen in Fig. 1(b), where we show underdoped Bi2212 and Dy2 samples with very similar Tc≃66K. For more severely UD samples, with [formula]K, spectral changes in the Dy-substituted samples are far more dramatic. In Fig. 1(c), we see that quasiparticle peaks in the Dy samples are no longer visible, even well below Tc, consistent with earlier work on Y-doped Bi2212 and also Bi2201 & LSCO [\cite=TANAKA] [\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Hashimoto] [\cite=Kondo] [\cite=Ma]. In contrast, Bi2212 and Ca-doped samples with comparable Tc continue to exhibit quasiparticle peaks. In this respect the latter two are similar to epitaxially grown thin film samples that exhibit quasiparticle peaks all the way down to the lowest Tc [\cite=NODAL].

A significant feature of the highly underdoped Dy samples in Fig. 1(c) is that, in addition to the strong suppression of the quasiparticle peak, there is severe loss of low energy spectral weight. To clearly highlight this, we show the doping evolution of antinodal spectra for the Dy1 (Fig. 1(d)) and Dy2 (Fig. 1(e)) samples. These observations are in striking contrast to the Bi2212 and Ca-doped data in Fig. 1(f), where we do see a systematic reduction of the quasiparticle peak with underdoping, but not a complete wipe out of the low-energy spectral weight. To the extent that the superconducting state peak-dip-hump line shape [\cite=PEAKDIPHUMP] [\cite=NORMANDING] originates from one broad normal-state spectral peak, the changes in spectra of the Dy materials are not simply due to a loss of coherence, but more likely a loss of the entire spectral weight near the chemical potential.

The doping evolution of the [formula]-dependent gap is illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. In Fig. 2 we contrast the optimally doped Dy1 OP 86K sample (panels (a,b)) with a severely underdoped Dy1 UD 38K sample (panels (c,d)), the spectra being particle-hole symmetrized to better illustrate the gap. The OP 86K sample shows a well defined quasiparticle peak over the entire Fermi surface (panel (a)) with a simple d-wave gap of the form Δ max| cos (2φ)| (blue curve in panel (b)). For the UD 38K sample, we see in Fig. 2(c) well-defined quasiparticles near the node (red spectra), but not near the antinode (blue spectra). The near-nodal gaps (red triangles in panel (d)) are obtained from the energy of quasiparticle peaks and continue to follow a d-wave gap (blue curve in 2(d)). But once the quasiparticle peak is lost closer to the antinode, one has to use some other definition of the gap scale. We identify a "break" in the spectrum, by locating the energy scale at which it deviates from the black straight lines (panel (c)), which leads to the gap estimates (blue squares) in panel (d).

Despite the larger error bar associated with gap scale extraction in the absence of quasiparticles, it is nevertheless clear (Fig. 2(d)) that the UD 38K Dy1 sample has an energy gap that deviates markedly from the simple d-wave form. This observation is called "two-gap" in the UD regime, in contrast with a "single gap" near optimality (panel (b)). The two-gap feature found here is consistent with earlier work [\cite=TANAKA] [\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Hashimoto] [\cite=Kondo] [\cite=Ma]. It is easy to observe from Fig. 2 that the Fermi surface angle at which the energy gap starts to deviate from Δ max| cos (2φ)| form matches with the one at which quasiparticel peak gets washed out. This is very similar to the two-gap behavior demonstrated in [\cite=TANAKA] [\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Hashimoto] [\cite=Kondo] [\cite=Ma]. From these one might conclude that two-gap behavior is directly correlated with a loss of well-defined quasiparticle excitations in the antinodal region. However, we would like to point out the recently published ARPES data on Y doped Bi2212 [\cite=Vishik_NJP] [\cite=Vishik_PNAS], where two-gap behavior has been observed despite the presence of sharp antinodal quasiparticle peaks.

We next show that the two-gap behavior is not a universal feature of all underdoped samples. To make this point, we compare in Fig. 3 the gap anisotropies of the Ca-doped samples (panels (a,b)) with the Dy2 samples (panels (c,d)) with essentially identical Tc, where both families have the same optimal Tc. The near optimal samples, OD 79K Ca (panel (a)) and OP 81K Dy2 (panel (c)) both have a simple d-wave anisotropy (although different maximum gap values at the antinode). But upon underdoping to similar Tc values, the two have markedly different gap anisotropies. The UD 59K Dy2 sample (panel (d)) shows two-gap behavior, and an absence of quasiparticles near the antinode (similar to the discussion in connection with Fig. 2 above). However, the UD 54K Ca sample (panel (b)) continues to exhibit sharp quasiparticles and a "single gap", despite a very similar Tc as the UD 59K Dy2.

Having established the qualitative differences in the gap anisotropies for various samples as a function of underdoping, we next summarize in Fig. 4 the doping evolution of various spectroscopic features. Instead of estimating the carrier concentration in our samples using an empirical formula [\cite=Presland] (that may or may not be valid for various cation substitutions), we prefer to use the measured Tc / T maxc to label the doping. In Fig. 4(a) we show the doping evolution of the antinodal energy gap, which is consistent with the known increase in the gap with underdoping.

The coherent spectral weight Z for antinodal quasiparticles is plotted in Fig. 4(b) (for details on the procedure used to estimate this weight, from a ratio of spectral areas, see the supplementary information). The Dy1 and Dy2 samples both show a sudden and compete loss of Z with underdoping [\cite=Fournier], which coincides with the appearance of two-gap behavior. In marked contrast to the Dy samples, the Bi2212 and Ca samples that exhibit a single d-wave gap show a gradual drop in the antinodal Z. On the other hand, we find that the nodal excitations are much less sensitive to how the sample is underdoped compared to the antinodal ones. Similar sharp nodal excitations have been observed in Dy doped Bi2212 samples in [\cite=Vishik_PNAS] as well. The nodal quasiparticle weight Z in Fig. 4(c) decreases smoothly with underdoping for all families of samples, as expected for a doped Mott insulator [\cite=Anderson].

The two-gap behavior and the attendant loss of quasiparticle weight near the antinode imply a nodal-antinodal dichotomy, aspects of which have been recognized in [formula]-space [\cite=Zhou] [\cite=ShenKM] [\cite=HeRH2009] and in real space [\cite=McElroy] [\cite=Kohsaka] [\cite=Pushap]. Two possible, not mutually exclusive, causes of this behavior are disorder and competing orders.

It is known that antinodal states are much more susceptible to impurity scattering, while near nodal excitations are protected [\cite=Garg]. However, it is not a priori clear why certain cation substitutions (Dy) should lead to more electronic disorder than others (Ca). As shown by our X-ray studies in the supplement, there is no difference in the structural disorder in Dy and Ca samples. One possibility is that Dy has a local moment, but there is no direct experimental evidence for this.

The two-gap behavior in UD materials, with a large antinodal gap that persists above Tc, is suggestive of an order parameter, distinct from d-wave superconductivity, that sets in at the pseudogap temperature T*. There are several experiments [\cite=Kaminski] [\cite=Fauque] [\cite=HeRH2011] that find evidence for a broken symmetry at T*. However it is not understood how the observed small, and often subtle, order parameter(s) could lead to large antinodal gaps of ≃50  -  80meV, with a loss of spectral weight over a much larger energy range (Fig. 1(d,e)).

Now we would like to discuss the presence or absence of competing order parameters and their pertinence, if they exist, in HTSC systems based on our ARPES and X-ray measurements. Firstly, in our ARPES measurements on any of our BISCO 2212 samples, we have not found any direct evidence for CDW or any other density wave ordering in terms of zone folding. Secondly, our X-ray diffraction measurements did not provide any signature for additional superstructures expected as a consequence of density wave ordering. However, none of these null results provide definitive evidence for the absence of a density wave ordering, particularly in a short range form or just on the surface. On the other hand, in the previously published works [\cite=TANAKA] [\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Hashimoto] [\cite=Kondo] [\cite=Ma], two-gap behavior has been conjectured to be a direct consequence of phase competition between d-wave superconductivity and some density wave ordering. As we have already demonstrated, two-gap behavior in underdoped samples is not a universal feature. Therefore, even if we assume that presence of competing order parameter is signified by two-gap behavior, it can't be central the superconductivity in HTSC systems.

Whatever the mechanism leading to qualitatively different gap anisotropies for the UD Dy and Ca samples, it only produces relatively small, quantitative changes in key aspects of these materials, such as the dependence of Tc on doping, the presence of sharp nodal quasiparticles, and the pseudogap. We thus conclude that antinodal states do not make a substantial contribution to the universal features of HTSCs. Clearly, two gaps are not necessary for high temperature superconductivity. Moreover, it is important to remember that samples with the highest Tc always show a d-wave gap. The change in gap structure as the doping is reduced is not completely unexpected, as in strongly correlated samples, of which the HTSCs are prime examples, the relative strength of interactions depend sensitively on changes in doping and temperature, as shown by the many different phases exhibited in the phase diagram[\cite=Vishik_PNAS] [\cite=UTPALPNAS].
