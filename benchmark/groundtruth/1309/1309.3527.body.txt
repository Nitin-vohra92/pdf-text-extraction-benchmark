A Lower Bound for τ(n) of k-Multiperfect Number

Preliminary Concepts

The sum-of-positive divisor function σm(n) is defined as

[formula]

where d is a factor of n for natural numbers n and complex numbers m. In this definition, we concentrate only for m = 0 and m = 1 and denote them as τ(n) and σ(n) respectively. It is easy to see then that τ(n) counts the number of divisors of n and σ(n) gives the sum of the divisors of n. It is a known theorem that for any natural number [formula],

[formula]

For σ(n), n is said to be perfect if σ(n) = 2n.But if σ(n)  >  2n and σ(n)  <  2n, it is said to be abundant and deficient numbers respectively. In addition,a natural number n is said to be k- multiperfect number if σ(n)  =  k  ·  n for some integer k > 2. It should be noted that for integer k > 3 of k- multiperfect numbers, all these k- multiperfect numbers are abundant.

In studying perfect numbers, the abundancy index is helpful and defined as

[formula]

. If n is k-multiperfect, then σ(n)  =  k  ·  n and that implies I(n) = k.

It is easy to see that

[formula]

.

On the other hand, we know that the nth harmonic number denoted by Hn is defined as

[formula]

. Clearly, I(n)  ≤  Hn for all natural numbers n.

Some Results

Let us first consider some lemmas.

For [formula], the inequality

[formula]

holds.

Consider first the inequality

[formula]

By binomial expansion on the RHS of the inequality, we have

[formula]

Clearly,

[formula]

Adding both sides by [formula], we arrive on the desired inequality. On the other hand, consider the inequality

[formula]

Raising both sides by k + 2, we get

[formula]

Since the

[formula]

from below and from above respectively, then that proves the inequality.

The inequality

[formula]

holds.

By lemma 1,

[formula]

By some manipulations,

[formula]

Thus, we get

[formula]

Now, we consider the inequality

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

The other inequality can be solved in similar fashion.

The previous lemma can be written as

[formula]

where γ is the Euler- Mascheroni constant and ε, a positive number that can be expressed as

[formula]

and where ζ(n,m + 1) is said to be the Hurwitz zeta function. From this inequality, we can have a bound for γ.

[formula]

As n  →    +    ∞  , ε  →  0 and that will give us 0  <  γ  <  1. In fact, γ  =  0.57721... ( see Sloane's A001620 at OEIS.org)

Main Results

We can now rewrite Hn as

[formula]

Since we know that ε  <  1 - γ  <  0.5, then the margin of error ε becomes minimal and can be "ignored".Before we proceed to the main result, let us have some necessary results.

For nonnegative integers ki,

[formula]

where for every ki and kj, ki  ≠  kj and for all ki and ki + 1 , ki  <  ki + 1.

It should be noted that equality holds if ki  =  i. Now suppose that there exists ki  ≠  i. This would mean that in the set S  =  {1,2,3,...,n}, there is ki∉S. Thus, ki  >  n. Now, we have ki's such that

[formula]

for all j∈S such that j  ≠  ki. Adding all unit fractions [formula] for j  ≠  ki and j  =  ki, we get

[formula]

and thus,

[formula]

Suppose that ki's are not just any random natural numbers but rather all ki|n and the n in the [formula] will be replaced with τ(n). From this, we can rewrite the above inequality as

[formula]

For any natural n, the natural number n can be a k- multiperfect if the property

[formula]

is satisfied.

It was already established that

[formula]

From here, we eliminate can eliminate ε and we have

[formula]

Illustration of the Theorem

It is necessary to verify for some small natural numbers due to the effect if ε is not included. The table below will provide numerical information up to k = 26, that is the least τ(n) for every k-multiperfect numbers.

The table illustrates that suppose τ(n)  =  2000000, then n can never be 16-multiperfect. This helps us distinguish of a particular n can be k- multiperfect based on its τ(n). Although the lower bound is not that tight for every k- multiperfect number, at the very least, it does provide some information about it.
