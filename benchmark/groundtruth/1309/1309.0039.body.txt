15A83 Key words: partial matrices, completion, diagonal blocks, symmetric and antisymmetric matrices

Introduction

Let K be a field. A partial matrix over K is a matrix where only some of the entries are given and they are elements of K. A completion of a partial matrix is a specification of the unspecified entries. We say that a submatrix of a partial matrix is specified if all its entries are given. The problem of determining whether, given a partial matrix, a completion with some prescribed property exists and related problems have been widely studied: we quote, for instance, the papers [\cite=BW], [\cite=BHZ], [\cite=CJRW], [\cite=Gee], [\cite=Fie-Mar], [\cite=MQ], [\cite=Woe],

In [\cite=CJRW], Cohen, Johnson, Rodman and Woerdeman determined the maximum rank of the completions of a partial matrix in terms of the ranks and the sizes of its maximal specified submatrices. From the results in [\cite=CJRW], we get easily the minimum rank and the maximum rank of the completions of a partial matrix where only the diagonal blocks are given:

(See [\cite=CJRW].) Let n1,....,nk be nonzero natural numbers with n1  ≤  n2  ≤  ....  ≤  nk. Let Ai∈M(ni  ×  ni,K) for i = 1,...,k and ri  =  rank(Ai). Let A be the partial matrix where only the diagonal blocks are given and whose diagonal blocks are A1,...,Ak. Then we have:

(i) the minimum of {rk(Ã)|  Ã  A} is

[formula]

(ii) the maximum of {rk(Ã)|  Ã  A} is

[formula]

Here we determine the maximum rank of the symmetric completions of a symmetric partial matrix where only the diagonal blocks are given (see Theorem [\ref=matsim]) and the minimum rank and the maximum rank of the antisymmetric completions of an antisymmetric partial matrix where only the diagonal blocks are given (see Theorem [\ref=matantisim]). In [\cite=Cain], [\cite=Ca-deSa], [\cite=Tian], the analogous problem has been solved for hermitian matrices.

Completions of symmetric block diagonal partial matrices

Let K be a field of characteristic different from 2. Let n1,....,nk be nonzero natural numbers. Let Ai∈M(ni  ×  ni,K) be symmetric for i = 1,...,k and ri  =  rank(Ai). It is well known that, by a symmetric sequence of elementary operations hi, we can change the matrix Ai into a b-diagonal matrix Di.

Then there exists a completion of rank l of the partial matrix diag(A1,....,Ak) if and only if there exists a completion of rank l of the partial matrix diag(D1,....,Dk).

Let

[formula]

Suppose there exists a symmetric completion of the partial matrix diag(A1,....,Ak) of rank l. We apply the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h1 to the rows and the columns with index in I1, then we apply the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h2 to the rows and the columns with index in I2 and so on. In this way we get a symmetric completion of diag(D1,....,Dk) of rank l.

Conversely, suppose there exists a symmetric completion of diag(D1,....,Dk) of rank l. Apply the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h- 11 to the rows and to the columns with index in I1, then we apply the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h- 12 to the rows and the columns with index in I2 and so on. In this way we get a symmetric completion of diag(A1,....,Ak) of rank l.

Let K be a field of characteristic different from 2 and let n1,....,nk be nonzero natural numbers with n1  ≤  n2  ≤  ....  ≤  nk. Let Ai∈M(ni  ×  ni,K) for i = 1,...,k be symmetric matrices and let ri  =  rank(Ai). Let A be the partial matrix diag(A1,....,Ak). Then the maximum of {rk(Ã)|  Ã  A} is

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=matqualsiasi], any completion of A has rank less or equal than the number in ([\ref=formula]) Note that this can be proved directly in an easy way: clearly any completion of A has rank less or equal than [formula]; besides any completion of A has rank less or equal than [formula], since the submatrix of the completion given by the first [formula] rows has rank less or equal than [formula] and the submatrix given by the last nk rows has rank less or equal than [formula] (in fact its submatrix given by the first [formula] columns has rank less or equal than [formula] and the remaining part, that is Ak, has rank rk).

Now we prove, by induction on k, that we can complete A to a symmetric matrix whose rank is the number in ([\ref=formula]). By Remark [\ref=oss], we can suppose that Ai is b-diagonal for i = 1,...,k.

Case k = 2.

Let t =  max {n1  -  r1,n2 - r2}. Observe that t  ≤  n1 if and only if n2 - r2  ≤  n1.

[formula] If t  ≤  n1, we consider the following symmetric completion of A:

[formula]

By swapping the last t rows of the upper blocks of the matrix with the last t rows of the lower blocks of the matrix, we can see that the rank is n1  +  n2.

[formula] If t  >  n1, then t = n2 - r2 and n2 - r2  >  n1. In this case we consider the following symmetric completion of A:

[formula]

By swapping the first n1 rows of with the last n1 rows, we can see that the rank is n1  +  r2  +  n1.

So, in the case k = 2 we have constructed a symmetric completion of rank equal to

[formula]

that is  min {n1  +  n2,2n1  +  r2}.

Induction step. Let k  ≥  3.

[formula] If [formula], we can consider the following symmetric completion:

[formula]

where [formula]. By swapping the first s rows and the last s rows, we can see that its rank is [formula].

[formula] Suppose [formula]. Let P the submatrix of A given by the last [formula] rows and the last [formula] columns. By induction assumption, we can complete P to a symmetric matrix with rank

[formula]

We consider two cases: the case where we complete P to a symmetric matrix of rank [formula] and the case where we complete P to a symmetric matrix of rank [formula]. We state that, in both cases, we can complete A to a symmetric matrix of rank [formula].

- Case we complete P to a symmetric matrix of rank [formula].

By a symmetric sequence of elementary operation h, we can change the completion of P into a diagonal matrix D where all the elements of the diagonal are nonzero; then we can complete

[formula]

to the symmetric matrix

[formula]

which has rank [formula]. Then, by applying the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h- 1, we get a symmetric completion of A of rank [formula] .

- Case we complete P to a symmetric matrix of rank [formula].

By a symmetric sequence of elementary operation h, we can change the completion of P into a diagonal matrix L such that Li,i  ≠  0 if and only if [formula]; define

[formula]

observe that t  ≤  n1; then we can complete diag(A1,L) to the symmetric matrix

[formula]

which has rank [formula]. Then, by applying the symmmetric sequence of elementary operations h- 1, we get a symmetric completion of A of rank [formula].

Completions of antisymmetric block diagonal matrices

(a) If K is a field of characteristic 2, the set of the antisymmetric matrices n  ×  n over K is equal to the set of the matrices n  ×  n over K.

(b) If K is a field of characteristic different from 2, we can change, by a symmetric sequence of elementary operations, an antisymmetric matrix into a diagonal block matrix whose diagonal blocks are all equal to

[formula]

In fact, if in the i-th row (and thus in the i-th column) there is a nonzero element, by applying a symmetric sequence of elementary operations, we can suppose that the entry (i,i + 1) (and thus the entry (i + 1,i)) is nonzero and all the other entries of the i-th row and the i-th column are zero. By another symmetric sequence of elementary operations, we can get easily the form described above.

Let K be a field of characteristic different from 2. Let n1,....,nk be nonzero natural numbers. Let Ai∈M(ni  ×  ni,K) be antisymmetric matrices for i = 1,...,k and let ri  =  rank(Ai). Then there exists an antisymmetric completion of rank l of the partial matrix diag(A1,....,Ak) if and only if there exists an antisymmetric completion of rank l of the partial matrix diag(Rr1n1,....,Rrknk).

(It can be proved as Remark [\ref=oss].)

Let K be a field of characteristic different from 2. Let n1,....,nk be nonzero natural numbers with n1  ≤  n2  ≤  ....  ≤  nk. Let Ai∈M(ni  ×  ni,K) be antisymmetric matrices for i = 1,...,k and let ri  =  rank(Ai) (obviously the ri are even numbers). Let A be the partial matrix diag(A1,....,Ak). Then we have:

(i) the minimum of {rk(Ã)|  Ã  A} is

[formula]

(ii) the maximum of {rk(Ã)|  Ã  A} is

[formula]

(i) Let A'1,....,A'k be the matrices A1,....,Ak ordered according to the rank, i.e. let A'1,....,A'k be such that {A'1,....,A'k}  =  {A1,....,Ak} and s1  ≤  ....  ≤  sk, where si  =  rank(A'i). Obviously we can complete diag(A'1,....,A'k) to an antisymmetric matrix of rank l if and only if we can complete diag(A1,....,Ak) to an antisymmetric matrix of rank l. Let A'  =  diag(A'1,...,A'k). By Remark [\ref=oss2], we can suppose that A'i  =  Rsimi for i = 1,...,k, where mi is the number of the rows and of the columns of A'i.

Observe that, since si  ≤  si + 1, then si  ≤  mi + 1. Thus we can complete the matrix A' to the following antisymmetric matrix:

[formula]

where we omitted the sizes of the off-diagonal matrices for simplicity (the sizes are obliged). The rank of this completion is clearly  max {si|  i = 1,...,k}, which is equal to  max {ri|  i = 1,...,k}.

Finally, observe that, obviously, the rank of any completion of A is greater or equal than  max {ri|  i = 1,...,k}.

(ii) The same argument as in Theorem [\ref=matsim] proves that any antisymmetric completion of A has rank less or equal than

[formula]

Now we prove, by induction on k, that we can complete A to an antisymmetric matrix whose rank is the number above. By Remark [\ref=oss2], we can suppose that Ai  =  Rrini for i = 1,...,k.

Case k = 2.

Let t =  max {n1  -  r1,n2 - r2}. Observe that t  ≤  n1 if and only if n2 - r2  ≤  n1.

[formula] If t  ≤  n1, we consider the following antisymmetric completion of A:

[formula]

By swapping the last t rows of the upper blocks of the matrix with the last t rows of the lower blocks of the matrix, we can see that the rank is 〈n1  +  n2〉 (consider the two cases:

1) both n1 and n2 are odd or both of them are even

2) one of n1 and n2 is odd and the other is even).

[formula] If t  >  n1, then t = n2 - r2 and n2 - r2  >  n1. In this case we consider the following antisymmetric completion of A:

[formula]

By swapping the first n1 rows of with the last n1 rows, we can see that the rank is n1  +  r2  +  n1.

So, in the case k = 2 we have constructed a completion of rank equal to

[formula]

that is  min {〈n1  +  n2〉,2n1  +  r2}.

Induction step. Let k  ≥  3.

[formula] If [formula], we can consider the following antisymmetric completion:

[formula]

where [formula]. By swapping the first s rows with the last s rows, we can see that its rank is [formula].

[formula] Suppose [formula]. By induction assumption, we can complete the submatrix P of A given by the last [formula] rows and the last [formula] columns to an antisymmetric matrix with rank

[formula]

We consider two cases: the case where we complete P to a matrix of rank [formula] and the case we complete P to a matrix of rank [formula]. We will show that, in both cases, we can complete A to an antisymmetric matrix of rank [formula].

- Case we complete P to a matrix of rank [formula].

By a symmetric sequence of elementary operations h, we can change the completion of P into the matrix [formula]. Then we can complete

[formula]

to the antisymmetric matrix

[formula]

which has rank [formula], in fact:

if [formula] is even, the rank is

[formula]

if [formula] is odd, the rank is

[formula]

Then, by applying the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h- 1, we get an antisymmetric completion of A of rank [formula] .

- Case we complete P to a matrix of rank [formula].

By a symmetric sequence of elementary operations h, we can change the completion of P into [formula]; define

[formula]

observe that t  ≤  n1; then we can complete [formula] to the antisymmetric matrix

[formula]

which has rank [formula]; then, by applying the symmetric sequence of elementary operations h- 1, we get a completion of A of rank [formula].
