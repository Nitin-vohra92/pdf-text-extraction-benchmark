The Role of Anyonic Excitations in Fast Rotating Bose Gases Revisited

The experimental realization of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) of atomic gases [\cite=BEC] has given rise to a rich variety of phenomena and motivated numerous investigations focused on ultra-cold atomic Bose gases in rotating harmonic traps. BEC confined to two dimensions have been created [\cite=BEC2D] and their response under rotation has been studied. Basically, the rotation of a BEC produces vortices in the condensate [\cite=VORT1],[\cite=VORT2]. When the rotation frequency increases, the BEC state is destroyed and for sufficiently high frequency, a state corresponding to Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) [\cite=FQE] is expected to possibly occur [\cite=F10]. In particular, when the rotation frequency is tuned to the characteristic frequency of the harmonic confining potential in the radial plane, FQHE states have been predicted to become possible ground states for the system [\cite=WILK]. This observation has been followed by studies focused on the FQHE for bosons with short range interactions [\cite=WORKS1], [\cite=WORKS2]. FQHE states involve anyonic excitations [\cite=LERDA]. Starting from the standard Chern-Simons (CS) realization for anyons [\cite=LERDA], it has been shown in [\cite=FISCHER] that in the thermodynamical limit, a 2D harmonically trapped rotating Bose gas with attractive interactions can be stabilized (in a FQHE state) thanks to its anyonic (quasi-particle) excitations [\cite=F20].

The above mentioned description of anyons is not unique. Another realization has been investigated in [\cite=NOUS] where the minimal coupling of the statistical gauge potential to matter, which is constrained to have Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) dynamics, is supplemented by a Pauli-type coupling, as recalled below. While the effective Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theories stemming from each anyon realization both reproduce the (so far observed) low energy features of the Quantum Hall Fluids (QHF), slight differences do exist between CS and MCS anyons. These latter stem from a statistical interaction having finite range (whereas CS interaction has zero range) and have an additional attractive mutual interaction (absent for CS anyons). In this note, we point out that the existence of this attractive mutual interaction may have an impact on the ability of (MCS) anyonic excitations to stabilize an attractive Bose gas in a FQHE state. In particular, we find that stability requires that the range of the MCS statistical interaction does not exceed the typical wavelength for the atoms. The description of QHF within the MCSLG theory stemming from the MCS description of anyons is also discussed.

Consider an interacting Bose gas at zero temperature in a rotating harmonic trap with strong confinement in the direction of the rotation axis so that the system is actually two dimensional. The Hamiltonian in the rotating frame [\cite=DALF] and the corresponding action quoted here for further convenience are [\cite=FOOT1]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], the external gauge potential [formula] yields the Coriolis force, [formula] ([formula](resp. [formula]) is the rotation (resp. trapping) frequency), [formula], [formula] is the two-body potential felt by the bosons in the plane. It can be well approximated by [formula] since the scattering between ultra-cold bosons is dominated by the s-wave [\cite=DALF]. Here, g2 can be viewed as an effective coupling constant encoding basically the effects of the harmonic axial confinement (with trapping frequency [formula] and localization length [formula]) along the rotation axis on the initial 3D scattering properties of the atoms [\cite=GANG]. This will be discussed later on. In (1)-(2), the ellipses denote possible multi-body interaction terms. We now consider the "limit" ω≃ωT for which the trapping and centrifugal potential (nearly) balance each other so that W can be neglected.

The standard CS description of anyons [\cite=LERDA] obtained from (1)-(2) is achieved by minimally coupling to S0 a statistical CS gauge potential aμ: [formula] where the CS parameter η is dimensionless, [formula] with [formula] and [formula] as given above ([formula], fμν  =  ∂μaν  -  ∂νaμ, f0 (resp. fi) is the statistical magnetic (resp. electric) field). The equations of motion for aμ take the field-current identity form [formula] (i), insuring that particle-statistical magnetic flux composite anyonic objects are formed [\cite=LERDA]. Particle-flux coupling responsible for the formation of the above composite quasi-particles leads to the occurrence of Aharonov-Bohm type interactions. The anyonic character of the wave functions for the quasi-particles is determined by the Aharonov-Bohm phase [\cite=LERDA] [formula] (C is some closed curve) that is induced when one quasi-particle moves adiabatically around another one, equivalent to a double interchange of identical quasi-particles in the wave function. Then, the statistics of the quasi-particles is controlled by the value of η: they have Fermi(resp. Bose) statistics whenever [formula] (resp.[formula]), [formula]. The statistics is anyonic otherwise. Notice that, when η  =   [formula], the initial Bose statistics of the atoms is converted into a Fermi statistics for the quasi-particle which corresponds to the so called statistical transmutation [\cite=LERDA]. This, plugged into a second quantized formalism, leads to the usual CSLG action [\cite=ZHANG] underlying the main part of the analysis presented in [\cite=FISCHER]. Since the statistical interaction is mediated by a CS gauge potential, its range is zero.

An alternative realization for anyons has been proposed and discussed in [\cite=NOUS]. It is obtained by coupling a MCS statistical gauge potential aμ to S0 through minimal and non minimal (Pauli-type) coupling term, the strength of this latter being fixed to a specific value [\cite=NOUS], namely: S0  →  S2 [formula] (e2 has mass dimension 1), where the coupling constant of the Pauli-term (last term in S2) has been already fixed to the above mentioned specific value. Then, the equations of motion for aμ can be written as [formula] which is solved by (i). This latter observation has been used as a starting point to construct an effective theory reproducing the usual anyonic behavior [\cite=NOUS]. The Aharonov-Bohm phase defining the statistics of the resulting quasi-particles still verifies [formula] so that η again controls the statistics. However, anyons obtained through this construction have an additional attractive contact mutual interaction (not present in the CS case) [\cite=NOUS]. Combining S2 with the second quantization machinery, one obtains the corresponding MCSLG action

In (3), φ([formula]) is the order parameter, φ†φ  =  ρ, U(φ) denotes the LG potential for multi-body interactions, U(φ)  =  g3|φ|6  +  ... (g3  >  0 as in [\cite=FISCHER]). The non minimal coupling terms have been included in the extended covariant derivative (4). The statistical MCS gauge potential has a finite mass [\cite=DESER] M = |η|e2, so that the statistical interaction has a finite range [formula]. The CSLG action [\cite=ZHANG] is obtained from (3)-(4) by taking the limit e2  →    ∞  . While CSLG action is believed to encode the (so far observed) low energy physics of QHF, it appears that MCSLG action also reaches this goal and could therefore be used as an alternative description of QHF. This is discussed more closely at the end of this letter. For the moment, we assume that the system is in a FQHE state (η  ≠  0) described the MCSLG action (3)-(4).

The equations of motion derived from (3) are

[formula]

[formula]

where J0  =  ρ, Ji  =   [formula] and Dμ is defined in (4) while anyonic configurations, on which we now focus, are obtained from (5b) when [formula] [\cite=FOOOT2]. From the field's conjugate momenta Πφ†  =  Πa0 = 0, Πφ  =  iφ†, [formula] [formula], one obtains the Hamiltonian

[formula]

[formula]

where Di  =  ∂i  -  i(ai + Ai) and we defined [formula]. The positivity of the model requires ρ  ≤  mη2e2 [\cite=LATINSKY]. Restoring [formula] and c, this translates into ρ  ≤  ρlim, ρlim  =   [formula] where [formula] is a typical (de Broglie) wavelength for the atoms and [formula] ([formula]). This condition should be fulfilled by current experimental values, provided [formula], a condition that we now assume [\cite=F2]. Namely, for 7Li, 23Na, 87Rb, one obtains respectively [formula] 1029, 1030, 1031 cm- 2, which, for possibly reachable current Quantum Hall states, should be larger by several orders of magnitude than the experimental values reached by the matter density so that [formula].

Compared to the CSLG Hamiltonian [\cite=FISCHER], H involves additional contributions from the Maxwell part of (3) and the non minimal coupling terms in (4). The interaction energy g2ρ2 receives contributions from [formula] and the Pauli-type coupling in (4a): these latter combine to yield the first term in (6) together with the additional attractive (magnetic) contribution [formula] to g2ρ2. This, depending on the relative magnitude of Λ and Λst, may somehow alter the conclusion obtained in [\cite=FISCHER] from a CSLG description of anyons about the ability of statistical interaction to stabilize an attractive Bose gas, as we now show.

We set [formula], âi  =   ∂iφ  -  (ai  +  Ai), η  >  0. For N atoms in the trap, one has [formula]. Using [formula] and assuming that fields vanish at infinity so that boundary terms disappear, the static energy stemming from (6) can be conveniently written as

[formula]

[formula]

In (7), ω  >  0, the positive constants Ck's are given by [formula] [formula] ([formula] where Γ is the Euler function) and we have defined

[formula]

where [formula] and c have been reinstalled and the rightmost relation stems from ω  ≪  mc2 which holds for current experimental values for ω (taking [formula]-O(103) Hz as a benchmark). In the same way, the term ~  ωCk in (7) can also been neglected (since [formula] in view of [formula]).

The quartic interaction terms in (7) can be eliminated provided g2 is chosen to be

[formula]

Then, neglecting for the moment in (7) the small terms of order ~  O(γ6) (and higher) as in [\cite=FISCHER], the ground state of (7) is obtained for those configurations satisfying [formula], i  =  1,2. This, combined with (5a), (8), (9), further expanding the various contributions depending on Θ in powers of [formula] and using the fact that [formula] yields [formula] where, in the RHS, [formula] still holds so that this latter equation can be accurately approximated by

[formula]

When ω goes to zero, the solutions of (10) reduces smoothly [\cite=EZAWA] to the solutions of the Liouville equation

[formula]

These latter can be parametrized as [formula] (z  =  x1  +  ix2) for any holomorphic function h(z). The particular choice h(z)  =  (z0 / z)n (z  =  reiθ), [formula], gives rise to radially symmetric vortex-type solutions [formula] where r0 is some arbitrary length scale and [formula].

Let us discuss the above analysis. From (7)-(9), one realizes that the initial two-body coupling term ~  g2 can be compensated by the statistical interaction. In view of (7), for fixed η  >  0, the particular value g0 (8) represents the limiting value for the two-body coupling constant g2 below which the Bose gas cannot be stabilized by the statistical interaction. In the CS case, Λst  =  0 and g0 is negative. Then, when g2  =  g0, corresponding to an initial attractive Bose gas, the system behaves as a free anyon gas whose ground state (neglecting the small |φ|6 and higher order terms in U(φ)) is exactly described by (10) giving rise to non singular finite energy matter distribution [\cite=EZAWA]. Then, one would conclude as in [\cite=FISCHER] that an attractive Bose gas may be stabilized against collapse in the thermodynamical limit by anyonic excitations stemming from a CS (zero range) statistical interaction. This conclusion is somehow altered in the case of "non standard" MCS anyons. In this case, g0 receives an additional positive contribution from the (statistical) magnetic energy and the magnetic coupling in (4a) and the sign of g0 depends now on the relative magnitude of Λ and Λst (see (8)). When g2  =  g0, the system behaves again as a free MCS anyon gas whose ground state (neglecting again small γ6 and higher order terms) is now accurately described by (10). However, this situation can be reached by an initial attractive Bose gas only if Λst  <  Λ corresponding to negative values for g0. A MCS statistical interaction with range exceeding the typical wavelength Λ for the atoms could not protect an attractive Bose gas from collapse (in the thermodynamical limit).

Now, let us assume that Λst  <  Λ and discuss more closely (9) from a physical viewpoint. In (most of) current experiments, 2D atomic systems are obtained by tightening the axial confinement applied to the initial (harmonically trapped) 3D system, which restricts the dynamics of the atoms along the axial direction to zero point oscillations [\cite=GANG]. Kinematically, the system becomes 2D while the effective coupling constant g2 for the interparticle interaction depends closely on the motion of the atoms in the axial direction [\cite=GANG]. As shown in [\cite=GANG], [formula] (B≃0.915, ε is the typical energy for the relative motion of the atoms and as is the (3D) s-wave scattering length) where ε  ≪  ωz must hold. This regime (called quasi-2D regime in [\cite=GANG]), relevant here, seems to be accessible to experiments [\cite=BEC2D], [\cite=GANG]. Then, (9) holds provided as is tuned to the negative value as  =    -   [formula]. Typical values obtained for [formula] are [formula] (resp. [formula]) for a CS (resp. MCS) statistical interaction (assuming possibly reachable current Quantum Hall states and [formula]). Let us discuss the possible effect of the inclusion of the next to leading order interaction terms ~  |φ|6 on the stability of the system [\cite=DENSPROF], assuming that (9) holds. In the CS case, stability requires g3  >  0, as indicated in [\cite=FISCHER]. In the MCS case, the |φ|6 term in U(φ) receives an additional positive (repulsive) contribution coming from the infinite sum in (7). Then, stability in the MCS case is obtained provided [formula] >  0. The actual computation of g3, which here must correspond to the quasi-2D regime, is still lacking and would need to extend the analysis reported in [\cite=GANG] to the case of higher order interactions within the quasi-2D regime.

QHF, usually described in the low energy regime by a CSLG theory [\cite=ZHANG], can alternatively be described by a MCSLG theory as defined in (3)-(4). To compare to the CS case [\cite=ZHANG], it is convenient to add a chemical potential term to (3), [formula] (μ  >  0) and set U(φ)  =  0 in all. (5a) becomes [formula] μφ while the relevant anyonic configurations are still obtained when [formula] solving (5b). Then, the equations of motion admit the uniform (constant) density solution minimizing the energy [formula], given by

[formula]

where [formula], similar to the usual uniform density solution supported by the CSLG action for QHF[\cite=ZHANG]. (12b) implies that the external magnetic field is screened by the statistical magnetic field. This combined with [formula], yields ν  =  2πη where ν is the filling factor. When statistical transmutation occurs as expected in Hall systems, [formula], k  ≥  0. Introducing polar coordinates (r,θ) and setting [formula], [formula], a0  =  a0(r) ([formula], [formula] is the winding number), one finds that [formula] admits static finite energy vortex solutions satisfying the boundary conditions ρ  ~  n0, α(r)  ~  mωr2 for r  →    ∞  , ρ  →  0, α(r)  →    -  n for r  →  0. The vortex effective magnetic flux [formula] is then Φ  =   - 2πn (F0  =  εij∂iAj). Using n0  =  ηF0, [formula], Φ is related formally to the "vortex charge" [formula] through Q  =    -  ηΦ  =  2πηn. When statistical transmutation occurs, [formula] so that the vortices can be interpreted as (the analogue of) the fractionally charged Laughlin quasi-particles, as it is the case in the CS description of QHF [\cite=ZHANG]. Finally, by expanding [formula] around the (mean field) uniform solution (12) up to the quadratic order in the fields fluctuations, fixing the gauge freedom, integrating out the fluctuations of the statistical field, one obtains the low energy effective action for the matter degree of freedom. It yields the following dispersion relation

[formula] ([formula] [formula] [formula] since Θ0  ≪  1). This indicates that the system has a gap, so that the fluid described by [formula] is incompressible.

Although CS and MCS anyons share many similar properties (in particular those related to the statistical phase), MCS anyons feel an additional attractive contact mutual interaction. Therefore (when Λst  ≠  0), CS and MCS anyons must be considered as distinct composite objects, both carrying anyonic statistics. This can be understood from the mechanism [\cite=NOUS] responsible for the formation of each type of these particle-flux anyonic composite (quasi-particles), reflecting itself in each case into the origin of the field-current identity i). Recall that i) physically expresses the fact that for a distribution of point-like particles only localized (statistical) fields can appear. This is automatically fulfilled in the CS case (see S1) since the CS statistical interaction has zero range. In the MCS case for which the interaction has finite range, i) results from an exact cancellation between electric and Pauli-type coupling effects [\cite=NOUS], which amounts to fix the Pauli coupling constant to a specific value (see [\cite=REMARK]). This leads to the appearance of an additional attractive contact interaction (whose strength grows as Λst increases) among the resulting MCS anyons which, apart from this, behave essentially as CS anyons. The relevant question is now to examine if some effects specific to the MCS framework, in particular those related to the above contact attraction, may be experimentally observed. Clearly, the "electronic" Quantum Hall systems are excluded: the fact that the repulsive Coulomb interaction among electrons cannot be manipulated combined with the specific features of the experimentally accessible observables make these systems only sensitive to the properties both shared by CS and MCS anyons in the long wavelength limit. In fast rotating (harmonically trapped) Bose gases, the interaction among atoms can be manipulated, offering a way to study the stabilization of initially attractive Bose gases in a FQHE state through their anyonic excitations. As we have shown, stability may be in particular somehow conditioned by the actual nature of the statistical interaction. Basically, anyons of MCS origin loose their ability to stabilize the system as the range of the MCS interaction grows. We note that an interesting proposal to measure the statistical phase of anyons has been presented in [\cite=PAREDES]. This, combined with an experimental implementation of the analysis presented here may provide a deeper insight into the physical features of the anyonic composite quasi-particles.
