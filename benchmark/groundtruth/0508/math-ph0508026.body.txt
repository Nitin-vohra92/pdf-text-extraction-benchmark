[formula] grading of the classical Lie algebras.

Introduction

In Weyl's original classification of the classical Lie algebras [\cite=weyl46], scant regard was paid to their graded structure. The introduction of supersymmetry and Lie superalgebras to physics [\cite=berezin2] [\cite=haag1] [\cite=kac1] led to renewed scrutiny of the properties of Lie algebras concomitant with their grading, and in 1978 Rittenberg, Wyler and Lukierski discovered the generalized Lie algebras and superalgebras, also known as Lie color algebras and Lie color superalgebras [\cite=rittenberg1] [\cite=rittenberg2] [\cite=lukierski1]. Rittenberg  et al.  demonstrated how to construct a Lie color algebra from a Lie algebra with a grading, and Scheunert subsequently proved that all Lie color algebras can be obtained in this manner [\cite=scheunert78].

A knowledge of the grading of a Lie algebra is required for the construction of the associated Lie color algebras: this provided the impetus for the present study of the [formula] gradings of the classical Lie algebras.

The paper is organized as follows. Sec. [\ref=s.intro] contains introductory remarks on graded algebras and Clifford algebras and also serves to define the notation.

Sec. [\ref=s.la_f] describes a graded classification of the classical Lie algebras, based on their description in terms of matrix algebras over one of eight graded fields or Clifford algebras.

Sec. [\ref=s.la_r] describes higher gradings of Lie algebras, for example the grading of [formula] when N is divisible by a power of two, and recasts these Lie algebras in terms of matrix algebras over higher Clifford algebras. Sec. [\ref=s.conclusion] presents concluding remarks.

Conventions on graded algebras

Throughout this work Γ denotes a finite abelian group. The groups of principal relevance are [formula] and [formula], the direct sum of n copies of [formula]. A convenient representation of [formula] is the set {0,1} with addition modulo 2, and the corresponding representation of [formula] consists of the 2n n-tuples comprised of 1's and 0's.

A [formula]-graded vector space consists of a vector space V equipped with a partition into subspaces, each of which is labelled by an element of Γ,

[formula]

A [formula]-graded algebra consists of an algebra A which is a graded vector space, It follows that if A has a unit element then it belongs to A0.

Consider a graded algebra equipped with an adjoint, denoted by †. In addition to the usual conditions for an anti-involution,

[formula]

The Clifford algebra [formula] is a real algebra of dimension 2  d+ + d-, generated by d+ + d- basis elements ei satisfying,

[formula]

eijk is a shorthand notation for eiejek. Each Clifford algebra has several adjoint operators, collectively denoted by [formula]. The first adjoint, Clifford Reversion, reverses the order of the Clifford product, Thus x†(0,0)  =  x̄ and x†(d+,d-)  =  .

[formula] has a natural [formula] grading. The grade associated with eijk is the (d+ + d-)-tuple with 1's in positions i,j,k and 0's in the remaining positions. e†ijk has the same grade as eijk, as required by Eq. [\eqref=eq.preserve].

If algebras A and B have gradings [formula] and [formula], then the tensor product [formula] has a [formula] grading,

[formula]

For the purposes of grading, all algebras are regarded as real algebras. Hence Clifford algebras over the complex field, [formula], are regarded as tensor products of real algebras,

Consider the matrix algebra [formula] of D  ×  D matrices over [formula], where [formula] is a Clifford algebra. [formula] may be regarded as a real tensor product, where [formula] denotes the matrix transpose and [formula] is the metric. [formula] admits adjoints with both skew-symmetric and symmetric non-degenerate metrics. The symmetric metrics may be either Euclidean, g  =  I, or pseudo-Euclidean with signature (D+,D-), g  =  ID+,D-.

[formula]-grading of the classical Lie algebras

. Graded classification

Each classical Lie algebra (LA) may be represented as a subalgebra of [formula], where [formula] is a field or more generally a Clifford algebra. The LA then inherits the [formula] grading of [formula]. The purpose of this section is thus to find an [formula] with the highest possible grading for each LA. The classical LA's associated with each [formula] are described in this section, and the defining equations for each LA are presented in Sec. [\ref=s.la_def].

Table [\ref=t.la] lists the [formula]'s employed in this work, together with isomorphic Clifford algebras and their [formula] gradings.

Eq. [\eqref=eq.f3] permits the symplectic algebras to be reclassified, thereby yielding a higher grading than Eq. [\eqref=eq.f2].

Table [\ref=t.la] contains the classification of the classical LA's with respect to Eq. [\eqref=eq.f3]. A blank in the table indicates that the corresponding LA is superfluous to the classification. For instance, neither [formula] nor [formula] is needed for the classification.

. Defining equations

The defining equations for the classical LA's take the form,

Consider the LA obtained from Eq. [\eqref=eq.la_def] with [formula], g  =  I and [formula]. L may be expressed as a tensor product (Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp]),

[formula]

where [formula]. Eq.'s [\eqref=eq.cliff], [\eqref=eq.r_ad] and [\eqref=eq.la] then yield,

[formula]

Consequently L1 is skew-symmetric and Le1, Le2 and Le12 are symmetric. More generally, for any classical LA,

[formula]

Let symmetric matrices be denoted by Si and skew-symmetric matrices by Ai.

A matrix-representation of L may be constructed, using Eq. [\eqref=eq.ex1] in conjunction with a matrix-representation of [formula]. An [formula] representation of [formula] is given by,

[formula]

leading to an [formula] representation of L,

[formula]

This matches the representation of [formula] [\cite=gilmore74].

Nomenclature

The traditional nomenclature for the symplectic algebras, [formula] and [formula], is not appropriate for the description of these algebras in terms of [formula] and [formula]: a new notation is desirable.

Since the classical LA's are automorphism algebras, they may be specified as [formula] or [formula] .

Alternatively, the designation of each LA as [formula] or [formula] is in common use for the six [formula]'s in Eq. [\eqref=eq.f2] [\cite=porteous95], so to complete the classification we need only consider the remaining two [formula]'s: [formula] and [formula].

[formula] is defined analogously to [formula]; both LA's may also be specified as [formula] , [formula].

In order to obtain an alternative notation for [formula] , let us first express the adjoint as a tensor product,

[formula]

Thus Clifford Conjugation of the tensor product is equivalent to Reversion of [formula] tensored with Clifford Conjugation of [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] , a logical but cumbersome designation for [formula] is [formula].

Reversion has no effect on [formula], since   =  1 and  = e1. Consequently [formula], and [formula].

Higher grading

. Tensor product of graded algebras

In Sec. [\ref=s.la_f] each classical LA was expressed as a subalgebra of [formula] and consequently inherited the grading of [formula]. [formula] may be regarded as a tensor product of [formula] and [formula], (Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp]), and both components may carry a grading. The total grading is then the direct sum of the gradings for each term (cf Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_grade]),

[formula]

[formula]

and this grading is inherited by the classical LA's.

[formula] and its metric may be expressed as tensor products,

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the tensor product of n copies of [formula].

[formula] equipped with matrix transpose is isomorphic to [formula] equipped with Reversion (cf Eq. [\eqref=eq.cl2]),

[formula]

Substituting Eq.'s [\eqref=eq.tp_rn]--[\eqref=eq.cl2_cong] into Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_ad_def] yields, [formula] and [formula] carry [formula] and [formula] gradings which are invariant under the adjoint, and it follows from Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_f_def] that [formula] carries a [formula] grading which is also invariant under the adjoint. Consequently the LA (Eq. [\eqref=eq.la_def]) inherits the grading.

For the special case D+  =  D-, [formula] may be further factorized as

[formula]

[formula] equipped with the adjoint [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] equipped with †(1,0), and the attendant grading is [formula].

The grading of LA's associated with [formula] may be reduced for the special case D+ + D- = 1, cf Remark [\ref=r.reduced].

. Higher Clifford algebras

In Sec. [\ref=ss.tp] the grading of [formula] was exposed by expressing the algebra as a tensor product of graded algebras (Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_f_def]). In this section the tensor product is expressed in terms of a higher Clifford algebra which plays a role analogous to [formula] in Sec. [\ref=s.la_f].

[formula] is first expressed as, It follows that the LA inherits the grading of [formula] and that the LA may be defined directly in terms of a Clifford algebra with a manifest grading,

[formula]

A standard expression for tensor products involving [formula] is [\cite=porteous95],

[formula]

Eq. [\eqref=eq.t_alg_r] follows by induction. Eq. [\eqref=eq.t_alg_c] follows upon tensoring Eq [\eqref=eq.t_alg_r] with [formula] and applying Eq. [\eqref=eq.complex].

The adjoint for each tensor product in Table [\ref=t.higher] is equivalent to the adjoint of the higher Clifford algebra in the same row.

Let us first consider the real Clifford algebras. Let ei,  i  ≤  d+ + d-, denote basis elements for [formula] , and Ei,  i  ≤  2, denote basis elements for [formula] .

The (d+ + d- + 2) basis elements for [formula] are [\cite=brauer35],

Applying the tensor-product adjoint yields,

[formula]

[formula] squares to + 1 and does not change sign under the adjoint, hence the corresponding adjoint of [formula] is †(a+  +  1,a-). Replacing E†(2,0)i with E†(1,0)i yields †(a+,a-  +  1), and the first row of Table [\ref=t.higher] follows by induction on n+ and n-. The second row follows upon tensoring the first row with [formula] and applying Eq. [\eqref=eq.complex].

For [formula],

[formula]

where,

[formula]

For [formula],

Eq. [\eqref=eq.fa] may be proved by applying Lemma [\ref=lem.t_alg] to Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_f], where [formula] and [formula] are as defined in Prop. [\ref=p.pad].

The remaining task is to establish the connection between the adjoints of [formula] and [formula] which arise in the proposition.

Setting,

[formula]

in the first row of Table [\ref=t.higher] and then comparing with Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_f_def] with (D+,D-) set to (1,0) yields,

[formula]

This establishes the connection between the adjoints for the real case, and Prop. [\ref=p.pad] follows upon taking the tensor product of this equation with [formula].

The complex case follows upon taking the tensor product with [formula] and applying Eq. [\eqref=eq.complex]. The special case, D+  =  D-, also involves Eq. [\eqref=eq.sc] and requires setting (n+,n-)  =  (n,1) in Table [\ref=t.higher].

. Non-tensorial grading

The grading described in Sec's. [\ref=ss.tp] and [\ref=ss.hca] reflects the tensorial structure of the Lie algebras. It is also possible to impose a [formula] grading that is not associated with a tensorial structure. For example, a [formula] grading can be imposed on a vector space or a matrix. In this section we briefly describe such a grading.

In Sec. [\ref=ss.hca] each classical LA was expressed as a subalgebra of [formula] or [formula] and consequently inherited the grading of [formula]. [formula] may be regarded as a tensor product of [formula] with [formula], and [formula] may carry a non-tensorial grading. The total grading is then the direct sum of the gradings for each term (cf Eq. [\eqref=eq.tp_grade]),

[formula]

The (D+,D-) metric does not affect the non-tensorial grading, and hence [formula] is equivalent to [formula] for grading purposes.

A [formula] grading may be imposed by partitioning [formula] into diagonal and off-diagonal blocks. The diagonal blocks must be square but the dimensions are otherwise arbitrary, where, The grading is well-behaved under multiplication and invariant under transpose. It is also invariant under the adjoint (Eq. [\eqref=eq.r_ad]), because the metric is diagonal (pseudo-Euclidean) and hence does not mix matrix elements with different grades (Sec. [\ref=s.la_def]). The grading is not compatible with a skew-symmetric metric, but in the present work only pseudo-Euclidean metrics are employed. The arbitrary subdivision may be repeated to yield a [formula] grading,

[formula]

where, Subdividing s times yields a [formula] grading. Each subdivision of the D  ×  D matrix doubles the number of blocks in each row, and hence the non-tensorial grading is constrained by,

[formula]

For comparison, the tensorial subdivision with the same number of blocks, [formula], has double the grading, [formula].

Conclusion

To illuminate the [formula] grading of the classical Lie algebras, the conventional classification in terms of matrix algebras over two, three or six Clifford algebras has been expanded to include a total of eight Clifford algebras. In so doing, the symplectic algebras have been placed on an equal footing with the orthogonal and unitary algebras. In particular, all the Lie algebras have been expressed in terms of pseudo-Euclidean metrics. The eight Clifford algebras and associated classical Lie algebras have gradings ranging from zero for [formula] to [formula] for [formula] and [formula], as per Table [\ref=t.la].

Lie algebras with matrix dimensions divisible by a power of two have been recast in terms of matrix algebras over higher Clifford algebras with a higher grading. For example, the [formula] grading of [formula] becomes apparent when the Lie algebra is expressed in terms of a matrix algebra over [formula]. The defining equations for the Lie algebras involve a matrix adjoint operator, and this generally corresponds to a non-standard adjoint of the higher Clifford algebras, ie an adjoint other than Clifford Reversion or Clifford Conjugation. It is hoped that the description of Lie algebras in terms of matrix algebras over higher Clifford algebras will facilitate the description of the associated Lie color algebras.
