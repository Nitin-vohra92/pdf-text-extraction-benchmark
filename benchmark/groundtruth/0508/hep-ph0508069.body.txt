Introduction :

The non-ideal behaviour of QGP seen in lattice simulations [\cite=ka.1] [\cite=ka.2] [\cite=ka.3] of QCD, and the elliptical flow observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions (RHICs) lead to hot debate on the nature of QGP near the critical temperature, Tc, for the last few years [\cite=qgp.1]. Various models such as (a) QGP with confinement effects, (b) strongly interacting QGP (sQGP), (c) strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (SCQGP), and (d) quasi-particle QGP (qQGP). In model (a), confinement effects like bag constant [\cite=rh.1], Cornel potential [\cite=ba.1] etc. are assumed to give rise to non-ideal behaviour of QGP. In (b) [\cite=sh.1], effects of bound states of colorless as well as colored hadron resonances are assumed to be responsible. In (c) [\cite=ba.2] [\cite=ba.3], it is assumed that QGP near Tc is what is called strongly coupled plasma (SCP) and EoS of SCP in QED with proper modifications for QCD fits very well lattice data. In (d), QGP is made up of quasi-particles with temperature dependent mass [\cite=pe.1] [\cite=pe.2]. Different varities of qQGP were proposed in order to make the theory thermodynamically consistent as well as consistent with perturbative and non-perturbative calculations of QCD [\cite=lh.1] [\cite=s.1].

Here we revisit qQGP with a new method, which involves a less number of parameters, to derive EoS of QGP at zero chemical potential (μ). Here μ means quark chemical potential which is one third of the baryon chemical potential. We start from energy density, rather than pressure as done earlier, and derive various thermodynamic properties by fixing the parameters of the model. Further we extend the model to include finite chemical potential and obtain quark density (nq), change in pressure (ΔP) due to finite μ and quark susceptibility for 2-flavor QGP.

Phenomenological Model :

The basic assumption in this model is that quarks and gluons in QGP are not bare quarks and gluons, but they are quasi-particles. Because of their collective behaviour in QGP, massless partons acquire masses equal to their respective plasma frequencies and become quasi-partons. Following the standard procedure of statistical mechanics [\cite=pa.1], the grand partition function is given by,

[formula]

where the sum is over energy states Er and particle number states Ns. Now we assume that QGP is made up of non-interacting quasi-partons and on taking thermodynamic limit, we get,

[formula]

where q is called q-potential and ∓   for bosons and fermions. β and z are temperature and fugacity respectively. εk is the single particle energy, given by,

[formula]

where k is momentum and m2 is the temperature dependent mass. The main effects of the interaction of bare partons, namely collective effects, are taken in (T, μ) dependent mass term and treat them as non-interacting quasi-partons. With this assumption, the average energy U is given by,

[formula]

which on taking continum limit and after some algebra, we get,

[formula]

where gf is the degenarcy and equal to [formula] for gluons and equal to 2  nf for quarks. nf is the number of flavors. K1 and K2 are modified Bessel functions of order 1 and 2 respectively.

Thermodynamics (ε, P, C2s) of QGP with zero μ:

Let us first consider the EoS of QGP with zero chemical potential and take z = 1. Hence we get the energy density, expressed in terms of [formula], for the quark gluon plasma of quasi-partons is

[formula]

[formula]

where εs is the Stefan-Boltzman gas limit of QGP, which may be obtained by taking high temperature limits of Eq. ([\ref=eq:u]) for gluons and quarks separately and adding them. mg is the temperature dependent gluon mass, which is equal to the plasma frequency, i.e, [formula]. This is obtained from the finite temperature perturbative calculations [\cite=th.1] [\cite=bz.1]. Note that both gluons and quarks contributes to the gluon mass. However, in the case of mq, the temperature dependent mass of quarks, we take [formula] and no contribution from gluons at linear response level. g2 is related to the two-loop order running coupling constant, given by,

[formula]

where ΛT is a parameter related to QCD scale parameter. This choice of αs(T) is motivated from lattice simulations. With these values of masses with above αs, we can evaluate the e(T) from Eq. ([\ref=eq:u]). Note that the only temperature dependence in e(T) comes from αs(T), which has the same form as that of lattice simulations [\cite=ka.1] with ΛT as a free parameter. Pressure can be calculated from the thermodynamic relation [formula] and we get

[formula]

where P0 and T0 are pressure and temperature at some reference points. Note that the standard relation of pressure and q-potential is not valid here because of temperature dependent εk. We can rederive it using the same procedure from Patria [\cite=pa.1], as follows,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, the standard relation of pressure and q-potential is not thermodynamically consistent in our case. One need extra term arising because of the temperature dependent mass. Hence we use Eq. ([\ref=eq:p]) to evaluate pressure. Note that earlier works are all based on modeling the extra term so as to fit the lattice data.

Once we know P and ε, [formula] can be evaluated.

Thermodynamics (nq, ΔP, χq) of QGP with finite μ:

Recently, there are lot attempts to simulate QCD with finite μ on lattice and results are reported in Ref. [\cite=fk.1] [\cite=ak.1] etc. Here we consider the recent results of Allton et. al. [\cite=ak.1] for 2-flavor QGP and try to extend our model to finite μ and explain their results. Again using the standard procedure of statistical mechanics, we have,

[formula]

which on continum limit and after some algebra, reduces to

[formula]

Now we modify earlier m2q(T) to m2q(T,μ) as

[formula]

inspired by QCD perturbative calculations [\cite=ps.1]. In our case nf  =  2 and g2 is related to two-loop order running coupling constant, discussed earlier, but need to be modified to take account of finite μ. Following the work of Schneider [\cite=sch.1] and Letessier, Rafelski [\cite=lr.1], now we change T / ΛT in Eq. ([\ref=eq:ls]) as

[formula]

where a is a parameter which is equal to (1.91 / 2.91)2 in the calculation of Schneider for μ / T  ≤  1 and 1 / π2 in a phenomological model of Letessier and Rafelski.

From nq, we may obtain other thermodynamic quantities like,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Results :

It is interesting to see that that this simple model very nicely fits lattice data [\cite=ka.1] [\cite=ka.2] [\cite=ka.3] on all three systems, namely, gluon plasma, 2-flavor and 3-flavor QGP in the case of zero chemical potential. In Fig. 1, we ploted P(T)  /  T4 Vs T for pure gauge, 2-flavor and 3-flavor QGP along with lattice results. Note that, in the case of flavored QGP, since there is (10%  ±  5%) uncertainty in P data [\cite=ka.3] on taking continum limit with massless quarks [\cite=ka.3], we multiply the lattice data by the factor 1.1 and is plotted. For each system ΛT are adjusted so that we get a good fit to lattice results. We have fixed P0 from the lattice data at the critical temperature Tc for each system. Surprisingly good fit is obtained for all systems with ΛT equal to 173, 119 and 74 MeV for gluon plasma, 2-flavor and 3-flavor QGP respectively. We have taken nf equal to 0, 2 and 3 respectively for three systems.

Once P(T) is obtained, then other macroscopic quantities may be derivable from P(T) and no other parameters are needed. In Fig. 2, we plotted ε  /  T4 Vs T / Tc for all three systems along with lattice results [\cite=ka.4] and it fits well without any extra parameters. All the three curves looks similar, but shifts to left as flavor content increases. We have taken Tc equal to 275, 175 and 155 MeV respectively for gluon plasma, 2-flavor and 3-flavor QGP.

In Fig. 3, c2s is plotted for all three systems, again with lattice results for gluon plasma. Reasonably good fit for gluon plasma and our model's out come for the flavored QGP. All the three curves have similar behaviour, i.e, sharp rise near Tc and then flatten to the value close to 1 / 3. c2s is larger for larger flavor content. For 2-flavor QGP it is almost coinsides with that of gluon plasma.

In Fig. 4, nq / T3 is plotted for 2-flavor QGP and compared with recent lattice data with out any new parameters. Only the parameter needed is ΛT which is fixed by the results of QGP with zero μ earlier. For different values of μ / Tc, all curves have similar behaviour and very nicely fits with lattice points for T  ≥  1.2  Tc. Note that this result is for a  =  (1.91 / 2.91)2 [\cite=sch.1] in Eq. ([\ref=eq:lsa]). For the other value, a = 1 / π2 [\cite=lr.1], results are not satisfactory, eventhough both results coinside for T  >  1.5  Tc.

ΔP  /  T4 and χq / T2 are plotted in Fig. 5 and 6 and again fits with the lattice results. Note that in the case finite μ case also we multiply the lattice data by a factor 1.1 as we did for μ = 0 case.

Very close to T = Tc, i.e., T  <  1.2  Tc, fits or outcome of our model is not good, especially for ε, c2s, nq etc. Lattice data also has large error bars very close to Tc. However, except for small region at T = Tc, our results are very good for all regions of T  >  Tc. For T  <  Tc, any way our model is not applicable because the system may not be in plasma state.

Conclusions :

We revisited the quasi-particle picture of QGP with a new method with less parameters. In this method we derive the energy density, ε(T), first and not P(T) as done earlier, and derive P(T), c2s etc. QGP is assumed to be consists of non-interacting quasi-partons with temperature and chemical potential dependent masses. Interactions between bare partons lead to collective effects in QGP and hence they acquire masses equal to plasma frequencies. The plasma frequency depends on running coupling constant and we used 2-loop order αs(T,μ), which is similar to that of lattice simulations, with one parameter related to QCD scale parameter. The thermodynamic properties of QGP depends on this parameter as well as one integration constant in pressure term which we fix to the lattice point at Tc. Both the parameters are different for different systems like gluon plasma, 2-flavor and 3-flavor QGP etc. Using two system dependent parameter, very good fits to lattice results were obtained for energy density, pressure, speed of sound, quark density, quark susceptibility etc. No other effects like temperature dependent bag pressure, confinement effects, effective degrees of freedom etc. were needed to fit the lattice results. In comparison with other models, which generally use more than two system dependent paarameters, here, just with two system dependent parameter and using αs(T,μ), inspired by lattice simulation of QCD, fits lattice results very nicely. Hence the non-ideal effects seen in lattice simulations of QCD may be related to collective behaviour of QGP. Recently, very good fit to lattice results on EoS of QGP is also obtained [\cite=ba.3] by treating QGP as SCQGP and again the nature of EoS is determined by plasma parameter which depends on collective properties of plasma.
