The trail of discrete X-ray sources in the early-type galaxy NGC 4261: anisotropy in the globular cluster distribution?

Introduction

NGC 4261 is an early-type galaxy in the Virgo West Cloud, at the distance of 32 Mpc ([\citealt=Gavazzi99]). It belongs to a group of galaxies ([\citealt=Garcia93] [\citealt=Nolthenius93]) that does not show prominent sign of gravitational interactions. The H-band luminosity of NGC 4261 is [formula] corresponding to a dynamical mass of [formula] (using a mass to light ratio of about 1.2, from [\citealt=Zibetti02]), ranking this galaxy among the most massive galaxies in Virgo. The optical spectrum is consistent with a dominant population of old stars (~  11 Gyr, [\citealt=Gavazzi02]) and the light distribution is smooth with no evidence of sub-structure ([\citealt=Schweizer92]; [\citealt=Colbert01]). NGC 4261 is a FRI radio galaxy (3C 270) showing two radio jets emanating from a nucleus hosting a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 5 ×   108 M[formula] ([\citealt=Ferrarese96]) surrounded by a dusty torus and a nuclear disk ([\citealt=Jaffe96]; [\citealt=Ferrarese96]). The X-ray nuclear power from the underlying AGN has been well studied by XMM and Chandra: the X-ray luminosity is LX  ~  5  ×  1041 erg s- 1, and the X-ray spectrum is a power law absorbed by a column density N[formula] cm- 2. The source appears to be embedded in diffuse hot gas (kBT  ~  0.6 keV) and shows low amplitude, rapid variability ([\citealt=Chiaberge03]; [\citealt=Sambruna03]; [\citealt=Gliozzi03]).

Thanks to the high spatial resolution of Chandra, [\citealt=Zezas03] (ZHFM03 hereafter) have discovered the presence of about sixty bright off-nuclear X-ray sources in NGC 4261, which stand out for their large-scale anisotropic pattern. The anisotropy extends over an angle of ~  4', corresponding to a linear dimension of ~  40 kpc (~  5 effective core radii large, since re = 4.6 kpc for NGC 4261; [\citealt=Gavazzi03]). ZHFM03 interpret this anisotropy as evidence that the X-ray sources are associated with young stellar population, possibly formed in a recent episode of star formation triggered by some dynamical agent along tidal tails. In spite of any optical evidence of either a young population (the population in the nuclear regions is as old as 15 Gyrs; see [\citealt=Gavazzi03] and [\citealt=Goudfrooij94]) or of recent merging events, ZHFM03 suggest a high mass binary origin for the majority of the sources, based on the significantly higher efficiency of the formation of High Mass X-ray Binaries relative to the Low Mass ones. This interpretation makes NGC 4261 a rather unique example, in clear contrast with Chandra observations of other early-type galaxies, where the X-ray sources are generally distributed nearly isotropically, trace the dominant (old) stellar population, and are believed to belong to the Low Mass X-ray Binary population (LMXB, e.g. [\citealt=Verbunt84]; [\citealt=Sarazin03]; [\citealt=Kim04]). In addition, a significant fraction (~   20% -70% ) of these LMXBs is associated to globular clusters (GCs; [\citealt=Sarazin03]; [\citealt=Angelini01]; [\citealt=Kundu02]; [\citealt=Maccarone03]; [\citealt=Minniti04]), with a preference to GCs with redder color index, i.e., clusters that are more metal rich ([\citealt=Cote98]; [\citealt=Sarazin03]; [\citealt=West04]). In this perspective, the case of NGC 4261 stands out as a remarkable exception worth of further study.

We have therefore chosen to study its case again, in order to deepen our understanding of the the nature of the X-ray sources in external galaxies. For this reason we have used archive observations of Chandra, of the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), and of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (see Table 1 for a summary of the dataset used) to search for optical counterparts of the X-ray sources, and to study their relation with the GC population of NGC 4261.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In §2 we describe the data reduction, in the X-ray and optical bands. In §3 we proceed on studying the properties of the optical point-like sources, and we cross-correlate the optical data with the X-ray data. We then derive the luminosity function of the X-ray source population. In §4 we investigate on the azimuthal anisotropy of the X-ray sources, and on that of the underlying GC candidate population. In the context of our new findings we discuss in §5 the nature of the sources and their potential in tracing the history of assembly of NGC 4261 in the Virgo cluster.

Data reduction

X-ray data

NGC 4261 was observed by Chandra [\citep=Weisskopf00] with the ACIS-S3 CCD on 2000 May 6 for a total exposure of 37,210 s (see Table [\ref=tab:obs] for details). The data were collected in 1/2 sub-array mode to avoid the pile-up of the central AGN source. The active field of view is shown in Figure [\ref=fig1] over-plotted on an optical image of the galaxy. The data reduction was performed with the package CIAO v. 3.0.2 and CALDB v. 2.2. Data were cleaned for high background periods due to particle induced flares and the resulting exposure time is of 28.3 ks. Individual sources were detected using a wavelet-detection algorithm (wavdetect in CIAO), with the same parameters used by ZHFM03, in three energy bands: full band (0.3 - 7.0 keV), soft band (0.3  -  2.0 keV) and hard band (2.0  -  7.0 keV). The catalog that we obtained includes 54 sources detected above the probability threshold of 10- 6 that implies ≤   1 false detection due to statistical fluctuations. The positions of the X-ray sources are shown in Figure [\ref=fig2]. In Table [\ref=tab:sources] we give the source number (column 1), the right ascension and declination J2000 (column 2 and 3). Count rates (column 4) are converted into unabsorbed luminosities (0.2  -  10 keV) assuming a power-law model with photon index 1.7 and a Galactic line of sight column density of NH= 5.8 ×   1020 cm- 2 ([\citealt=Stark92]). ZHFM03 do not publish a catalog of their X-ray sources, so a comparison of the two source lists is not possible. However, a visual inspection of their Figure 1 indicate consistency. The Chandra data relative to the central region of this galaxy has also been analyzed by [\cite=Chiaberge03] and [\cite=Gliozzi03], who have mostly focused on the AGN emission in the X-ray, radio and optical bands.

In particular [\cite=Gliozzi03] detect 5 off-nuclear sources: A, B, C, E coincide with our sources 38, 33, 31, and 14 respectively, and D, which we do not detect (our source 19 is the closest, at ~  10''). Although these authors comment of the fact that they do not find optical counterparts for any of their sources, they do not comment on the possible connection of these sources with the jet, in spite of the evidence that two of them, (A and E) are aligned and at opposite ends of it.

Optical data

We have used archive observations of INT and HST WFPC2 for a systematic search of the optical counterparts of the X-ray sources.

We extracted a deep r' band image from the INT-Wide Field Camera (WFC) archive, consisting of three exposures of 500 seconds each, for a total integration time of 1500 seconds. The image covers the whole galaxy (the field of view of the INT WFC is of about 0.5 deg2) and has a mean seeing of ~  1'' ([\citealt=Khosroshahi04]). The reduction of the images was carried out using standard tasks in the IRAF package. Bias subtraction and flat-field normalization were applied to each exposure using the median of several bias frames and flat-field exposures obtained during the observations. The three exposures were combined using a median filter, that automatically removes cosmic rays. Using reference catalogues of astrometric stars, we obtained a WCS solution for the whole field having a mean RMS of ~  1 arcsec.

HST WFPC2 observations cover the central portion of the galaxy, as shown by the white boxes in Figure [\ref=fig1]. The south-east (SE) field was observed using three different filters: F675W, F547M, F791W while only the F702W filter is available for the north-west (NW) field. The exposure times of the four images are given in Table [\ref=tab:obs].

For our analysis we started from pipelined processed data. For both HST WFPC2 and INT, we first fitted ellipses to the isophote of the galaxy using the task ELLIPSE from the IRAF package, and subtracted the model from the data. The resulting image was then used to detect sources with SExtractor ([\citealt=SExtractor]). The last isophote has a major and minor axis of 4.5 and 3.2 arcmin respectively. We improve the relative HST astrometry from ~  0.7 to ~  0.2 arcsec comparing the overlap region between the NW and SE field. On the contrary we did not try to make any improvement in the relative astrometry between Chandra and INT/HST images. We note that, for both HST and INT images, the model subtraction leaves a quadrupole structure in the central region. Although this region is smaller in the HST data, we exclude a wider area of ~  0.5 square arcmin, due to the presence of residuals in the INT data that could induce spurious results in our comparisons. This structure was already noticed by [\cite=Colbert01] for this object, and was attributed to the boxyness of the galaxy.

Using SExtractor we extracted point-like objects from the model subtracted images of both INT and HST datasets. We set a SExtractor detection threshold of 2.5 σ over the local background. We select as point-like sources objects with the following properties: (i) a magnitude error smaller than 0.1, (ii) ellipticity smaller than 0.5, (iii) FWHM between 1 and 4 pixels (0.1-0.4 arcsec) for HST, as suggested by [\cite=Gebhardt99], and FWHM between 3 and 10 pixels (1-3 arcsec) for INT. Note that for the HST-SE field we based our selection upon the F675W filter owing to its longer exposure. As a final step, we have checked the SExtractor results by visual inspection, and we have removed objects on or close to the CCDs edges for the HST images.

Results

Selection of candidate globular clusters

For the SE field of the HST observation, we have been able to estimate the color of the sources presented in §2.2. The instrumental magnitudes, provided by SExtractor, were converted in the Johnson-Cousin V, R and I systems using the synthetic transformations given in [\citealt=Holtzman95]. In order to estimate the photometric error due to model subtraction we measured the photometry on the unsubtracted image using local background and apertures from the subtracted image. The difference in the V-I color of each globular cluster obtained from the two different estimates is shown in Figure [\ref=fig3]. The distribution appears fairly gaussian with a mean difference of [formula] mag (see Figure [\ref=fig3]). The total photometric uncertainty is thus given by the combination of the error on the measure of GCs magnitudes (given by SExtractor), the error on the zero-point (taken from [\citealp=Holtzman95]) and the uncertainty due to the model subtraction (0.07 mag, Fig.[\ref=fig3]). This results in a mean error on the V-I color of ~   0.11 mag. We used F547M and F791W filters to determine the color index (V-I) of the extracted objects. We select 325 objects detected in each of the three filters with V-I color between 0 and 2 ([\citealt=Gebhardt99]), that we consider GC. Their color index and magnitude distributions shown in Figure [\ref=fig4] are consistent with those of the globular cluster populations observed in other massive early-type galaxies ([\citealt=Ashman98]; [\citealt=Cote98]; [\citealt=Kundu01b]; [\citealt=Larsen01b]; [\citealt=West04]), reinforcing our definition. The color index distribution spreads from V-I ~  0.5 to ~  2, indicating that both populations of GC (red and blue) are present. Thus the unimodal distribution observed in the V-I color histogram is probably due to the blending of different GCs populations.

Since the color information is restricted to the HST-SE field, we cannot classify as GCs the sources extracted from the other optical images at the same confidence. However, we have first considered sources in the region common to all three datasets (~  1 arcmin2). The cross-correlation between the three lists indicates that ~   ~ 97% (37/38) and ~  83% (49/59) of the sources in the HST-NW and INT field respectively coincide with a GC in the HST-SE field. Given this high fraction, we are confident that even the point-like sources from the INT dataset are good "GC candidates", in spite of the lower resolution of the instrument. In what follows, we will use the "GC candidate" list (from the INT observation), that provides an homogeneous set of optical sources over the whole galaxy.

As a final check, we have also compared the sky projected distribution of the INT and HST GC candidates. Since HST-SE and HST-NW fields have different exposure times, we restrict the HST sample to a magnitude R = 24.5 (i.e. the magnitude limit of the shallowest field). The comparison is done through an adaptive kernel density analysis. This technique is a two-step procedure which first applies a pilot smoothing to estimate the local density of GCs, starting from the list of their positions only, and then uses a smoothing window variable in size that decreases with increasing local density. In this way the statistical noise in low-density regions can be reduced without smearing out the high density peaks [\citep=Silverman86]. As shown in Figure [\ref=fig5], the iso-density contours from the adaptive kernel analysis are in very good agreement, confirming the reliability of the INT GCs dataset. What is apparent in the figure is the peculiar distribution of the GC population, that shows two main concentrations NE and SW of the nuclear region. The presence of the same structures in both datasets ensures that it is not a feature derived from the poor subtraction in the central region (the black area in Figure [\ref=fig5]) since the equivalent area in the HST data is negligible.

Cross-correlation of X-Ray and Optical data

In order to investigate the nature of the X-ray sources we have looked for optical counterparts. The central source (n. 29) is identified with the AGN ([\citealt=Chiaberge03]; [\citealt=Sambruna03]; [\citealt=Gliozzi03]), and sources no. 27, 43 and 53 with background/foreground galaxies. The positions of the remaining X-ray sources have been cross-correlated with the GC sample, from the HST fields, with a matching radius of 0.5 arcsec, and from the INT dataset, with a matching radius of 1 arcsec. These choices take into account only the intrinsic astrometric uncertainties of the three datasets (see sections 2.1 and 2.2) and not the relative uncertainties eventually present between the optical and X-ray observations. Source 54 falls outside the model subtracted area, while sources no. 19, 31 and 33 fall in the central region excluded from our previous analysis. We found an optical counterpart for 23 of the 46 discrete X-ray sources that we assume all belonging to NGC 4261. The identification is indicated in Table [\ref=tab:sources]. To calculate the chance coincidence probability we performed 1000 Monte-Carlo simulations by shifting the positions of the INT and HST optical samples by a random offset and performing again the cross-correlation. We adopted a shift larger than the search radius but small enough so the sources do not fall outside the distribution of the X-ray sources (~  1.5 arcmin). The probability of finding more than one spurious association is ~  2.5% and ~  0.1% in the INT and HST sample, respectively. In Figure [\ref=fig6] we give a few examples that show the positions of the X-ray sources over-plotted onto the HST SE, HST NW and INT fields. The figure also demonstrates the good correspondence between the HST and INT counterparts, indicating again that the identifications obtained in the INT field not covered by HST are not severely hampered by the lower resolution of the INT image. Note that, where the color information is available, we found that all the X-ray sources inhabit a red (color index V-I >  1) GC, see Figure [\ref=fig4]. The optical identification with GC candidates for ~  50% of the X-ray sources suggests a LMXB origin for them ([\citealt=Verbunt04]).

Luminosity Function of X-ray sources

We verified the above statement by comparing the cumulative X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of our sources with those derived from observations of other galaxies (Figure [\ref=fig7]). In particular, we use the functional forms derived by [\cite=Grimm03] and [\cite=Gilfanov04] considered by these authors as a signature of a universal behavior for the HMXB and the LMXB populations, respectively; namely a single power-law for HMXB, with slope of α =  - 0.61, and a broken power-law for LMXB, with slopes of α1 =  - 0.8, and α2 =  - 4 for the high luminosity end. In testing the consistency with these universal functions, we have derived the XLF using all sources in Table [\ref=tab:sources], except for the AGN (source no. 29) and the 3 interlopers (sources no. 27, 43 and 53). We performed a log-log maximum likelihood fitting procedure for both HMXB and LMXB functional forms assuming fixed slopes. We considered as free parameter the normalization factors and, in the case of a broken power law, the luminosity of the break. The resulting XLFs are shown in Figure [\ref=fig7]. It is unquestionable that a single power-law cannot reproduce the LF of the sources in NGC 4261. It is also apparent that the LMXB broken-power law is a good representation of the data given also the value of the break luminosity, that we have left as a free parameter in the fitting procedure, and that is consistent with the Gilfanov value of Lb  =  5.1  ·  1038  erg  s -  1. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the X-ray sources in this galaxy are associated to a population of LMXBs. Note that we do not take into account incompleteness at low luminosities [\citep=Kim04]; however, we point out that at least at the high luminosity end (where incompleteness should not significantly affect the XLF slope) the luminosity function is much steeper than the XLF of the HMXBs.

Azimuthal anisotropy in the globular cluster distribution

ZHFM03 have shown with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that the spatial distribution of the X-ray sources in NGC 4261 is anisotropic. Using our list of 50 sources (sources n. 29, 27, 43 and 53 excluded) we confirm the spatial anisotropy over a scale of about 4' with very high confidence (P> 99.9% from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). In the preceding sections we have shown that the properties of the X-ray sources in NGC 4261 are consistent with a population of LMXBs. This however does not explain yet their spatial anisotropy, which is in stark contrast with the smooth isophotal distribution of the optical light. Given the close association with the GC population, which we find also has a peculiar distribution, we have considered the possibility that the anisotropy is nothing but a manifestation of an anisotropy seeded in the GC population. In order to test this hypothesis we have first done a statistical analysis on the spatial distribution of the GC candidates.

In order to investigate both the details of the spatial distributions of the X-ray and optical sources separately and their relation we have compared the normalized surface density of sources again with an adaptive kernel density analysis on the two sets of sources. In Figure [\ref=fig8] we show the iso-intensity contours extracted from the kernel analysis on the GC candidate sample (thin line) and on the X-ray sources (thick line). With this figure as a guide, we have defined 6 regions (see Figure [\ref=fig9], right panel) in which we have simply computed the surface number density of sources for both GCs and X-ray sources, which plot in Figure [\ref=fig9] (left panel) as a function of the region number. The errors associated with each entry reflects the total number of sources in the region, and gives a direct measure of the significance of the observed region-to-region variations, We also test the correlation between the two datasets using the IRAF task CROSSCOR and we find that the highest correlation between the two datasets is consistent with a null shift.

Discussion and conclusions

Our combined analysis of the X-ray and optical material available for NGC 4261 shows that the large majority of the X-ray sources in NGC 4261 are accreting LMXBs. About 50% of these sources have an optical counterpart, that we identify with a GC. Where color information is available, the sources are associated with the red (metal-rich) population, as already observed in several other galaxies. Further evidence of a LMXB origin comes from the interpretation of the luminosity function, consistent with the "universal" distribution proposed by [\cite=Gilfanov04].

The photometric analysis of the GC population of NGC 4261 carried on a portion of the galaxy (HST-SE field) shows that the properties of the GCs are similar to those observed in other early-type galaxies ([\citealt=Cote98]; [\citealt=Gebhardt99]; [\citealt=West04]). Furthermore this similarity extends to the connection between X-ray sources and GC population ([\citealt=Sarazin03]). In particular we note that the X-ray sources are preferentially associated with the brightest and reddest GCs. As in other ellipticals, we find that the GCs hosting a X-ray source are ~  7% and that the X-ray sources associated with GCs are ~  50%, consistent with the result of [\citealt=Kundu02]. It is therefore not surprising that NGC 4261 ranks among those galaxies having a sizable fraction of X-ray sources in GCs. The peculiarity of NGC 4261 resides mainly in the large scale anisotropy of the X-ray sources. Our adaptive kernel density analysis has highlighted the presence of a peculiar spatial distribution in the GC candidate population, and the existence of a correlation between the spatial anisotropy of the X-ray sources and the main over-densities seeded in the GC system. To our knowledge, this is the first time that X-ray sources indicate the presence of substructures in the distribution of GC.

A non uniform spatial distribution of the GC system of NGC 4261 may reflect a peculiar history of formation of this galaxy. In the paradigm of hierarchical clustering cosmogony, elliptical galaxies may be the end result of binary or multiple major mergers among gas-rich progenitors. Major mergers likely redistribute the original GC systems of the progenitor galaxies and trigger the formation of new GCs in the center as well as along the tidal tails of the new object arising from the merger. This would result in the coexistence of two populations, metal rich and metal poor clusters, that have different photometric properties, spatial distribution and dynamical characteristics, as shown in a recent work by [\cite=Li04]. Hierarchical build-up also implies a second way by which galaxy can grow, namely accretion of dwarf satellites that would lose their GCs to the primary system. GCs coming from shredded satellites could also contribute to spatial anisotropies and would be mostly metal-poor if such satellites are similar to nearby dwarfs. Evidence that either of these two mechanisms can account for a large fraction of the GC systems in ellipticals is still lacking ([\citealt=Strader04]). A close inspection of the photometric and kinematical properties of the GCs can in principle help disentangle many aspects of such complex galaxy genesis. NGC 4261 could be an excellent target for further investigations: combined Chandra and HST observations can thus potentially shed light on how early-type galaxies were assembled. In parallel, we are undertaking a theoretical study running high-resolution simulations of galaxy mergers similar to those carried on in [\citealt=Kazantzidis04], including a GC formation algorithm.
