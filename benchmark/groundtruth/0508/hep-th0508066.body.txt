A numerical study on the dimension of an extremely inhomogeneous matter distribution

In a previous work [\cite=Abdalla1], we have presented a study on the hierarchical metric

[formula]

where the metric is defined on all integers, depending on their decomposition in terms of powers of 2 as

[formula]

We obtained the following expression for the matter density,

[formula]

by means of the Einstein equations. Computing the Christoffel symbols and subsequently the curvature tensor for this metric requires some care, since we are not dealing with derivatives of functions, but differences of functions defined on a discrete space.

We speculated whether such a matter distribution could be described by a fractal. As it turned out, from our preliminary analisis (see [\cite=Abdalla1]), the dimension of the matter density tends slowly to d  =  3.

Considering the relation

[formula]

where K is some constant, and the constant d is the fractal dimension of the matter density [\cite=Mandelbrot], it is easy to see that it implies

[formula]

for large r. We have numerically computed N(r) and the plot ln N(r)  ×   ln r, in figure ([\ref=graph1]), showing that equation ([\ref=line]), although valid at very large r), is a good approximation for the behavior of the data.

Numerical fits for these points, taking increasingly larger samples, have given results for d that approach d  =  3, as shown in figure ([\ref=graph2]).

As a conclusion, we can say, now, that the dimension of the matter density that generates metric ([\ref=metric]) tends to d  =  3 as shown in figure ([\ref=graph2]).
