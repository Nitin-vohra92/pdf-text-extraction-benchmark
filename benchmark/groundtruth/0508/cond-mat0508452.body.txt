Reply to the comment by C. Capan and K. Behnia

A large Nernst signal observed in the normal (i.e. resistive) state of cuprates [\cite=xu] [\cite=cap] has been claimed to be a signature of an unusual "normal" state with mobile vortexes in disagreement with the BCS theory and its strong-coupling bipolaronic extension [\cite=alebook]. Such interpretation seriously undermines many works on superconducting cuprates, which consider the state above Tc as perfectly normal with no off-diagonal order, either long or short. We have argued that the vortex scenario is impossible to reconcile with the sharp resistive transitions at Tc in high-quality cuprates, and proposed a theory of the Nernst signal as a true normal state phenomenon [\cite=alezav]. The Comment [\cite=cap2] claims that the theory [\cite=alezav] is incompatible with a low value of thermopower S times the Hall angle, S tan Θ at low temperatures in underdoped cuprates.

I believe that the criticism [\cite=cap2] is faulty and misleading. In fact, the theory [\cite=alezav] did not make any general assumption on the relative magnitudes of the Nernst sugnal ey and S tan Θ. We demonstrated very good agreement between the theory and the experimental data in overdoped La1.8 Sr0.2CuO4, Fig.2 [\cite=alezav], where S tan Θ  >  ey. Here I show that the same theory describes well the Nernst signal and S tan Θ also in underdoped cuprates [\cite=cap] [\cite=cap2], where S tan Θ  ≪  ey at low temperatures. The authors of the comment [\cite=cap2] have missed an important point of the theory [\cite=alezav] i.e. that localisation of carriers below the mobility edge breaks the electron-hole symmetry at variance with ordinary metals where the familiar "Sondheimer" cancelation makes ey much smaller than S tan Θ because of this symmetry. The localised carrier contribution adds to the contribution of itinerant carriers to produce a large ey, while it reduces S and Θ. Such behaviour originates in the familiar "sign" (or "p - n") anomaly of the Hall conductivity of localised carriers. The sign of their Hall effect is often opposite to that of the thermopower as observed in many amorphous semiconductors [\cite=ell] and described theoretically [\cite=fri]. Hence, at small Θ  ≪  1, one can write S tan Θ  ≈  ρ(αextxx - |αlxx|)(Θext - |Θl|) and ey  ≈  ρ(αextyx + |αlyx|) - S tan Θ, where kinetic coefficients are expressed as the sums of extended (ext) and localised (l) carrier contributions, [formula], [formula], and ρ = 1 / σxx is the resistivity. Clearly these expressions can account for a low value of S tan Θ compared with a large value of ey in underdoped cuprates, where the contributuon of localised carriers is comparable with the extended carrier contribution. To illustrate quantitative agreement with the experiment [\cite=cap] [\cite=cap2] we use a textbook result S  ~  T valid near the mobility edge in amorphous semiconductors at low temperatures [\cite=mott3] and the Boltzmann scaling, [formula], [formula] in the magnetic field B. This gives S tan Θ  =  AT  /  (T1ρ) and ey  =  A(1 - T / T1) / ρ, where A and T1 are temperature independent. Even with these simplifications the theory describes both S tan Θ and ey measured in La1.94 Sr0.06CuO4 [\cite=cap] [\cite=cap2] using a single fitting parameter, T1 = 50K, the experimental ρ(T) [\cite=cap], and the scaling constant A = 0.78 μV mΩ  ·   cm/K, Fig.1. The same theory [\cite=alelog] also fits nicely the insulating-like low-temperature dependence of ρ(T) revealed in high magnetic fields [\cite=cap] [\cite=cap2].

To sum up, the Comment [\cite=cap2] has deplorably neglected essential parts of Ref. [\cite=alezav], which actually addressed the low value of S tan Θ in underdoped cuprates, the absence of a positive ey in non-superconducting cuprates, and its nonlinear magnetic field dependence (pages 4,3 and Fig.2 in [\cite=alezav], respectively). The coexistence of the large Nernst signal and the insulating-like resistivity in underdoped cuprates [\cite=cap] [\cite=cap2] sharply disagrees with the vortex scenario [\cite=xu], but agrees remarkably well with our theory [\cite=alezav].
