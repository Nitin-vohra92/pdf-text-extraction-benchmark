A simple proof of Witten Conjecture through localization

Introduction

In this paper, we obtain an alternate proof of the Witten's Conjecture [\cite=Wit] which claims that the tautological intersections on the moduli space of stable curves [formula] is governed by KdV hierarchy. It is first proved by M.Kontsevich [\cite=Kon] by constructing combinatorial model for the intersection theory of [formula] and interpreting the trivalent graph summation by a Feynman diagram expansion for a new matrix integral. A.Okounkov-R.Pandharipande [\cite=Oko-Pan] and M.Mirzakhani [\cite=Mirz] gave different approaches through the enumeration of branched coverings of [formula] and the Weil-Petersen volume, respectively. Recently, M.Kazarian-S.Lando [\cite=Kaz-Lando] obtained an algebro-geometric proof by using the ELSV-formula to relate the intersection indices of ψ-classes to Hurwitz numbers.

Here we take an approach using virtual functorial localization on the moduli space of relative stable morphisms [formula] [\cite=Li1]. [formula] consists of maps from Riemann surfaces of genus g and n = l(μ) marked points to [formula] which has prescribed ramification type μ at [formula]. As the result, we obtain a system of relations between linear Hodge integrals. It recursively expresses each linear Hodge integral by lower-dimensional ones. The first non-trivial relation of this system is 'cut-and-join relation', and is of same recursion type as that of single Hurwitz numbers [\cite=Li-Zha-Zhe]. Moreover, as we increase the ramification degree, we can extract a relation between absolute Gromov-Witten invariants from this relation. And we show this relation implies the following recursion relation for the correlation functions of topological gravity [\cite=Dijkgraaf]:

[formula]

which is equivalent to the Witten's Conjecture/Kontsevich Theorem. This recursion relation (*) is also equivalent to the Virasoro constraints; i.e. (*) can be expressed as linear, homogeneous differential equations for the τ-function [\cite=Dijkgraaf]

[formula]

[formula]

where Ln denote the differential operators

[formula]

As a remark, it is possible that the general recursion relation obtained from our approach implies the Virasoro conjecture for a general non-singular projective variety.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we recall the recursion formula obtained in [\cite=OneLambda] and derive cut-and-join relation as its special case. In section 3, we prove asymptotic formulas for the coefficients in the cut-and-join relation. Then we derive first two relations of the system of relations between linear Hodge integrals, and show that the cut-and-join relation implies (*).

Recursion Formula

The following recursion formula was derived in [\cite=OneLambda].

For any partition μ and e with |e|  <  |μ| + l(μ) - χ, we have

[formula]

where the sum is taken over all partitions ν of the same size as μ.

Here [formula] means taking the coefficient of λa, and [formula] consists of linear Hodge integrals as follows;

[formula]

where [formula] is the dual Hodge bundle;

[formula]

Introduce formal variable pi, qj such that [formula], [formula] , and form a generating series to define [formula] as follows:

[formula]

The convoluted term [formula] consists of double Hurwitz numbers as follows:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the double Hurwitz number with ramification type ν,μ with Euler characteristic χ. The recursion formula ([\ref=recursion]) was derived by integrating point-classes over the relative moduli space [formula], and the 'cut-and-join relation' is only the first term in this much more general formula. This can also be seen as follows: Denote by Jij(μ), Ci(μ) for the cut-and-join partitions of μ [\cite=Zho1] and consider the following identity obtained by localization method:

[formula]

It is straightforward to show that preimages of pr and pr - 1 under the branching morphism [formula] are the unique graph Γr and the 'cut-and-join graphs' of Γr, respectively. Hence we recover the 'cut-and-join relation' as the restriction of ([\ref=recursion]) to the first two fixed points {pr,pr - 1};

[formula]

where Γ's are the contributions from 'cut-and-join' graphs defined as follows;

Original graph that is mapped to the branching point pr

[formula]

Join graph that is obtained by joining i-th and j-th marked points:

[formula]

Cut graph that is obtained by pinching around the i-th marked point:

[formula]

Cut graph that is obtained by splitting around the i-th marked point:

[formula]

As was mentioned in [\cite=LLZ1], this 'cut-and-join relation' ([\ref=cut-and-join]) recovers the ELSV formula [\cite=ELSV] since this relation is of the same type as the recursion formula for single Hurwitz numbers [\cite=Li-Zha-Zhe], hence giving the identification of the graph contributions with single Hurwitz numbers:

[formula]

which is the ELSV formula. When there's no confusion, we will denote by η  =  ηij for the join-partition and ν  =  νi,p for the cut-partition of splitting μi = p + (μi - p) for some 1  ≤  p < μi. Also denote by ν1 and ν2 for the splitting of cut-partition ν such that [formula] with p∈ν1,μi - p∈ν2. Note that in the ΓC2-type contribution, unstable vertices (i.e. g = 0 and n=1,2) are included. We can also use any set [formula], n > 0 of fixed points and obtain relations between linear Hodge integrals. And these can be applied to derive deeper relations.

Degree Analysis

In this section, we study asymptotic behaviour of the 'cut-and-join relation' and obtain a system of relations between linear Hodge integrals. The Hodge integral terms in the graph contributions can be expanded as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] are multi-indices running over condition [formula]. Hence the top-degree terms consist of Hodge-integral of ψ-classes and lower degree terms involve λ-classes. This will give a system of relations between Hodge integrals involving one λ-class. More precisely, integrals will be determined recursively by either lower-dimensional or lower-degree λ-class integrals. The following asymptotic formula is crucial in degree analysis.

As n  →    ∞  , we have for k,l  ≥  0

[formula]

Let m be an integer such that 1 < m < n and consider three ranges of p,q as follows:

[formula]

Recall the Stirling's formula;

[formula]

For the summation over Rc, let m = nε and p = nx for some [formula] so that [formula], then we have

[formula]

As n  →    ∞  , we can send ε  →  0. For the summation over Rl and Rr, the top-degree terms belong to O(nk + 1 / 2) and O(nl + 1 / 2), respectively. Since we assume k,l  ≥  0, both cases belong to o(nk + l + 2), and this proves the first formula. For the second formula, Rl has highest order of nk + 1 / 2 and one can show that the leading term in the asymptotic behaviour is [formula]. After integration by parts, Rc gives the second highest term in the asymptotic behaviour

[formula]

This proves the second formula.

Let μi = Nxi for some [formula] and [formula]. By taking general values of xi, we can assume, without loss of generality, that [formula]. As the ramification degree tends to infinity, i.e. as N  →    ∞  , the Hodge integral expansion ([\ref=expansion]) tends to

[formula]

where m = 3g - 3 + n - (n / 2) is the highest degree of N in ([\ref=expansion]). Same expansion applies to each term in ([\ref=cut-and-join]). By taking out the common factor e|μ| and applying the asymptotic formula ([\ref=asymptotic]), we find that

[formula]

Putting them together in the 'cut-and-join relation' ([\ref=cut-and-join]) yields a system of relations between Hodge integrals with one λ-class as follows: First, we have a system of relations given by the spectrum of N-degree. Secondly, each relation given by some fixed N-degree stratum can be viewed as a polynomial in xi's;

[formula]

where [formula] is a half integer less than or equal to m + 1 and the coefficient C(si) of the homogeneous polynomial [formula] involves linear Hodge integrals. Since xi's are independent variables, we obtain vanishing relations for each of C(si)'s. In particular, the first few vanishing relations are given as follows:

For Nm + 1-stratum, we have a trivial identity:

[formula]

From Nm + 1 / 2-stratum, we obtain a relation between cut-and-join graphs:

[formula]

Lower degree strata will give relations for Hodge integrals involving non-trivial λ-class in terms of lower-dimensional ones. For example, the relation given by the Nm-stratum recovers the λ1-expression.

And the first non-trivial relation (**) implies the Witten's Conjecture (*):

The relation (**) implies (*).

Introduce formal variables [formula] and recall the Laplace Transformation:

[formula]

Applying Laplace Transformation to the Nm + 1 / 2-stratum gives the following relation:

[formula]

where w = ki + kj - 1. The last term is derived from direct integration;

[formula]

under change of variable r = xi + xj and s = xi - xj. Considering this as a polynomial in si's, we can isolate out coefficients to obtain

[formula]

The reason for getting 1 as coefficient in the Join-case is due to the following expansion

[formula]

In the notations of (*), we have σ̃n = (2n + 1)!!σn = (2n + 1)!!ψn and

[formula]

After multiplying a common factor [formula] on both sides of (#), we obtain

[formula]

which is the desired recursion relation (*). The factor 2k + 1 comes from missing j-th marked point in the Join-graph contribution, and the extra 1 / 2-factor on Cut-graph contributions is due to graph counting conventions. Hence we derived Witten's Conjecture / Kontsevich Theorem through localization on the relative moduli space.
