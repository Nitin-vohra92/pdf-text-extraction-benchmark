Bounded length intervals containing two primes and an almost-prime

Introduction

We are interested in trying to understand how small gaps between primes can be. If we let pn denote the [formula] prime, it is conjectured that

[formula]

This is the famous twin prime conjecture. Unfortunately we appear unable to prove any results of this strength. The best unconditional result is due to Goldston, Pintz and Yı ldı rı m [\cite=GPY] which states that

[formula]

Therefore we do not know that lim inf pn + 1 - pn is finite.

The method of [\cite=GPY] relies heavily on results about primes in arithmetic progressions. We say that the primes have 'level of distribution' θ if for any constant A there is a constant C = C(A) such that

[formula]

The Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem states that the primes have level of distribution 1 / 2, and this is a major ingredient in the proof of the Goldston-Pintz-Yı ldı rı m result.

If we could improve the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem to show that the primes have level of distribution θ for some constant θ > 1 / 2, then it would follow from [\cite=GPYI] that there is a constant D = D(θ) such that

[formula]

and so there would be infinitely many bounded gaps between primes. It is believed that such improvements to the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem are true, and Elliott and Halberstam [\cite=ElliottHalberstam] conjectured the following much stronger result. Friedlander and Granville [\cite=FriedlanderGranville] have shown that the primes do not have level of distribution 1, and so the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture represents the strongest possible result of this type.

Under the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture the Goldston-Pintz-Yı ldı rı m method gives [\cite=GPYI] that

[formula]

If we consider the length of 3 or more consecutive primes, however, we are unable to prove as strong results, even under the full strength of the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture. In particular we are unable to prove that there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length that contain at least 3 primes. The Goldston-Pintz-Yı ldı rı m methods can still be used, but even with the Elliot-Halberstam conjecture we are only able to prove that

[formula]

This should be contrasted with the following conjecture. By 'no fixed prime divisor' above we mean that for every prime p there is an integer np such that Li(np) is coprime to p for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. We call such a set of linear functions admissible.

We note that {n,n + 2,n + 6} is an admissible set of linear functions, and so the prime k-tuples conjecture predicts that lim inf npn + 2 - pn  ≤  6 (it is easy to verify that one cannot have pn + 2 - pn < 6 for n > 2). More generally, for any constant k > 0 the conjecture predicts that lim inf pn + k - pn  <    ∞  , and so there are infinitely many intervals of bounded size containing at least k primes.

At the moment the prime k-tuples conjecture appears beyond the techniques currently available to us. As an approximation to the conjecture, it is common to look for almost-prime numbers instead of primes, where almost-prime indicates that the number has only a 'few' prime factors.

Graham, Goldston, Pintz and Yı ldı rı m [\cite=GGPY] have shown that given an integer k, there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length (depending on k) containing at least k integers each with exactly two prime factors. It is a classical result of Halberstam and Richert [\cite=HalberstamRichert] that there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length (depending on k) which contain a prime and at least k numbers each with at most r prime factors for r sufficiently large (depending on k).

We investigate, under the assumption that the primes have level of distribution θ > 1 / 2, whether there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length (depending on k) containing 2 primes and k numbers each with at most r prime factors.

Initial Hypotheses

We will work with an assumption either on the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions of level θ, or a stronger assumption on numbers with exactly r prime factors each of which is of a given size.

Given constants 0  ≤  ηi  ≤  δi  ≤  1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r we define

[formula]

We put

[formula]

We can now state the two hypotheses that we will consider, the Bombieri-Vinogradov hypothesis of level θ, BV(θ), and the generalised Bombieri-Vinogradov hypothesis of level θ for Er numbers, GBV(θ,r). We note that by standard arguments in sieve methods (see, for example, [\cite=HalberstamRichert]) Hypothesis BV(θ) follows from the primes having level of distribution θ.

Statement of Results

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thrm:MainTheorem]

We consider two finite disjoint sets of integer linear functions [formula] and [formula], whose union [formula] is admissible. (We recall that a such set is admissible if for every prime p there is an integer np such that every function evaluated at np is coprime to p).

We wish to show that there are infinitely many n for which two of the functions from L(1)1 take prime values at n, and at all of the functions from L(2) take almost-prime values at n.

Since we are only interested in showing there are infinitely many such n, we adopt a normalisation of our linear functions, as done originally by Heath-Brown [\cite=HeathBrown] which simplifies our argument. By considering Li(n) = L(1)i(An + B) for suitable constants A and B we may assume that the functions Li satisfy the following conditions.

The functions Li(n) = ain + bi (1  ≤  i  ≤  k1 + k2) are distinct with ai > 0.

Each of the coefficients ai is composed of the same primes none of which divides the bj.

If i  ≠  j, then any prime factor of aibj - ajbi divides each of the al.

We let [formula] and [formula].

We now consider the sum

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the λd are real numbers which we declare later. C > 0 is a constant chosen sufficiently large so we can use the estimates of hypotheses BV(θ) or GBV(θ,r).

If we can show that S > 0 then we know there must be at least one n∈[N,2N] for which the terms in parentheses give a positive contribution to S. The second term in our expression for S is a square, and so is always non-negative. We see that the first term in parentheses is positive only when there are at least two primes and k2 numbers each with at most r prime factors amongst the Li(n) (1  ≤  i  ≤  k1 + k2). If we choose all our original functions to be of the form L(1)i(n) = n + hi (with hi  ≥  0) then all these integers then lie in an interval

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thrm:ElliottHalberstam]

We can get better quantitative results for the number of prime factors involved in our almost-prime if we assume a fixed level of distribution result for almost-primes and for primes, and then follow the work of [\cite=GGPY].

We consider the same sum S, but now we assume that L2  =  {L0} and we take r = 4. Thus k2 = 1 and k = k1 + 1.

[formula]

where Q1(L), Q2 are as before and

[formula]

As before, C is a suitably large positive constant.

We split the contribution to Q1' depending on whether L0(n) has exactly 1, 2, 3 or 4 prime factors. Thus

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

For technical reasons we find it harder to deal with terms arising when L(n) has a prime factor less than Nε or no prime factor greater than N1 / 2. Thus we obtain a lower bound for Q1j' by replacing βj(L0(n)) with β'j(L0(n)), where

[formula]

We can then obtain these asymptotic lower bounds. By following an equivalent argument to [\cite=Thorne] and [\cite=Maynard] but using Hypothesis GBV(0.99,j) to bound the error terms we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

As before, by Hypothesis BV(0.99) we also have for any L∈L

[formula]

Thus we have that

[formula]

where Jr is given above and

[formula]

Therefore given a polynomial P we can get an asymptotic lower bound for S by explicitly calculating the integrals I0, J1, J2, J3 and J4.

Explicitly we have for r = 1

[formula]

Similarly for r = 2 we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Similarly for r = 3 we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Finally for r = 4 we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We choose k = 22 and P(t) = 1 + 60t - 300t2 + 3500t3 and find that

[formula]

Thus we have that

[formula]

In particular, for N sufficiently large and ε sufficiently small we have S > 0, and so there are infinitely many n for which an admissible 22-tuple attains at least two prime values and one value with at most 4 prime factors.

The set {0,6,8,14,18,20,24,30,36,38,44,48,50,56,60,66,74,78,80,84,86,90} is an admissible 22-tuple, and so the interval
