Single Z Production at the Tevatron

Introduction

The Z boson provides a very clean system for studying electroweak physics and for searching for new physics because the electronic and muonic decays of the Z can be identified with very little background. The Tevatron now has substantial datasets of these decays, and these datasets have been used to measure a number of Standard-Model parameters and to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Here we describe a number of these measurements that have recently been completed.

Forward-Backward Asymmetry

Interference between Z-boson and photon propagators affect the direction of the electron resulting from the Drell-Yan process p  →  e+e-. One way to quantify this effect is to measure the forward-backward asymmetry of the electron. This asymmetry is measured in the Collins-Soper frame [\cite=CollinsSoper], which is defined as the rest frame of the electron pair, with the z axis defined as the bisector of the directions of the incoming proton beam and the negative of the incoming antiproton beam. Forward is defined as cos θ*  >  0 where θ* is the angle between the negative electron's direction and the positive z axis. Backward is when cos θ*  <  0. The measured asymmetry as a function of dielectron invariant mass is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Afb] for both the D0 and the CDF collaborations.

The D0 collaboration has used this forward-backward asymmetry AFB measurement to extract the value of the weak mixing angle sin 2θleff  =  0.2309  ±  0.0008  ±  0.0006 [\cite=D0_ZAsym]. This measurement is dominated by the high statistics in the Z pole region, and it is consistent with other measurements of this quantity which average to 0.23153  ±  0.00016.

The direction of the electron is affected by whether the Z / γ propagator was produced by an up or a down quark, so the D0 collaboration has used their asymmetry data to extract limits on the vector (gV) and axial-vector (gA) couplings of light quarks to the Z boson [\cite=D0_ZAsym]. They used RESBOS [\cite=RESBOS] to make templates using different values of the couplings while the value of the coupling between electrons and Z bosons was fixed to its SM value and sin 2θleff was set to its global average. The results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:D0CouplingLimits], which shows the 68% C.L. allowed regions for both 2-dimensional fits (where the couplings for the other light quark are fixed at their SM values) and 4-dimensional fits, where all the light-quark couplings are allowed to vary at the same time. All the fits are consistent with SM expectations.

AFB is sensitive to new physics at masses higher than could be directly produced at the Tevatron. In the absence of new physics, AFB is expected to be approximately constant at a value of 0.6 for dielectron invariant masses substantially above the Z mass. New physics could interfere with the Zγ propagator and change this value. Both the D0 and CDF AFB measurements (shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Afb]) are consistent with SM expectations, and therefore limit the possibility of new physics such as a massive [formula] that interferes with the SM propagators.

Angular Distributions

The CDF collaboration has chosen to measure sin 2θW form the angular distributions of the final-state electron rather than from the forward-backward asymmetry. The general expression for the angular distribution of the final-state electron in the Collins-Soper frame [\cite=CollinsSoper] is:

[formula]

Here the coefficients A0 to A7 are functions of the dielectron mass Mee, the transverse momentum PT of the Z boson, and the rapidity y. In perturbative QCD, A5, A6, and A7 are near 0, A1 and A3 are small when integrated over ±  y, A4 is sensitive to sin 2θW, and A0  =  A2. This last expression is the Lam-Tung equation, and it is only valid for spin-1 gluons. Since this expression is badly broken for spin-0 gluons, verifying that A0  =  A2 provides evidence for spin-1 gluons.

The measured angular coefficients [\cite=CDF_ZAngular] are plotted as a function of PT in Figure [\ref=fig:CDF_Zangular]. We see that these measurements are consistent with the Lam-Tung expression and therefore with a spin-1 gluon. A3 is close to 0 as expected for pQCD, and A4 is used to extract sin 2θW  =  0.2329  ±  0.0008+ 0.0010- 0.0009(QCD). All these results are consistent with SM expectations.

Z Transverse Momentum

The same dataset used by CDF to measure the angular coefficients was used to measure the transverse momentum of the Z boson. At low PT, the measurement smearing is large (on order of 2.2 GeV/ c) compared to the bin size of 0.5 GeV/ c. The unfolding is done by first correcting the input PT distribution for the Pythia Monte Carlo generator [\cite=Pythia] until the ratio of data/simulation is flat, and then using the simulation to determine bin-by-bin unfolding.

The unfolded PT distribution is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:zdsdptPRE] along with the NNLO theoretical prediction (FEWZ2) and the resummation prediction (ResBos[\cite=RESBOS]). The NNLO prediction is consistent with the measured result for high PT, while the ResBos prediction does a good job of matching the data over the entire PT range. A closer look at the ResBos prediction is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:dataOvrResb], which plots the ratio of the data to the ResBos theory. THe deviation seen in the region 40  <  PT  <  90 GeV/ c is where ResBos resummed, asymptotic, and perturbative cross sections are matched. Apparently the modeling could be improved in this region.

Conclusions

The Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 have substantial datasets of well-identified Z bosons. These datasets have been used to measure Standard Model parameters including the weak mixing angle (D0: 0.2309  ±  0.0008  ±  0.0006; CDF: 0.2329  ±  0.0008+ 0.0010- 0.0009(QCD)). Measurements are consistent with Standard Model expectations, such as spin-1 gluons rather than spin-0 gluons. Measurements of the Z-boson PT are now precise enough to help refine Drell-Yan phenomenology.
