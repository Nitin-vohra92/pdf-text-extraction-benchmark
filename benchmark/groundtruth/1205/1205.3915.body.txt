On Generalized Topological Groups

Introduction.

Császár first introduced generalized topological structures in his paper [\cite=csaszar11] and he also studied the notion of generalized continuity.

Let X be any set and let G  ⊆  P be a subfamily. Then G is a generalized topology if, [formula] and for any index set I, [formula] whenever Oi∈G,i∈I. A G-topological space X is called strong if the set X itself is a G-open. We will denote generalized topology by G-topology.

The elements of G are called G-open sets. Similarly, a generalized closed set, or G-closed set, is defined as complement of a G-open set.

Let X and Y be two G-topological spaces and let f:X  →  Y be a function. Then f is called G-continuous on X if for any G-open set O in Y, f- 1(O) is G-open in X.

The function f is called a G-homeomorphism from X to Y if both f and f- 1 are G-continouos functions. If we have a G-homeomorphism between X and Y we say that they are G-homeomorphic and we denote them by [formula].

Similarly, Császár defined neighbourhood systems in the generalized structure [\cite=csaszar11]. We need the following result from [\cite=csaszar11] to give the relation between open sets and neighbourhood systems.

Let Ψ be a G-neighboorhood system on X, let g  ⊆  P(X) . For O∈g and x∈O there exists a subset V∈ψ(x),ψ∈Ψx∈V  ⊆  O iff g is a G-topology on X.

Let X be any set and let Ψ,g be G-neighbourhopod system and G-topology on X respectively. Let A  ⊆  X. A point x∈X is called interior point of A if there exists a subset V∈ψ(x),V  ⊆  A.

All interior points of A  ⊆  X is called interior of A. It is denoted by [formula]. By definition it is obvious that [formula]. Actually interior of [formula] is equal to union of all G-open sets contained in A. Similarly we can define G-closure of A as intersection of all G-closd sets containing A. It is deonted by [formula].

By definition interior of a set is a G-open set while closure of a set is a G-closed set. Now we are ready to give the notion of point-wise continuity using the neighbourhood systems. From [\cite=csaszar11], we have the following definition.

Let (X,gX,Ψ(X)) and (Y,gY,Ψ(Y)) be two G-topological spaces with G-neighbourhood systems and f:X  →  Y be a function. We say that f is point-wise G-continuous at x∈X if for every G-neighbourhood V∈ψ(f(x)), there exists a G-neighbourhood U∈ψ(x) such that f(U)  ⊆  V.

f is (ΨX,ΨY)-continuous on X if f is point-wise continuous at every point x∈X. This continuity is more general than global continuity.

The fundamental reference for topological groups and their properties is [\cite=Arhangel01].

G-Topological Groups

In this section, we will introduce G-topological groups and give basic properties of this kind of groups. In order to define this, we need T2 G-topological spaces. From [\cite=csaszar13], we have the following definition.

Let (X,G) be a G-topological space. Then (X,G) is called a T2 space if for every pair x,y in X with x  ≠  y, there exist disjoint G-open sets U,V containing x,y respectively.

A base of G-topological space can be defined as follows.

Let (X,G) be a G-topological space and B  ⊆  G. Then B is called a base for the G-topology G if every G-open set can be written as union of some elements of B.

Let (X,GX) and (Y,GY) be two G-topological spaces. The product G-topology on X  ×  Y is the G-topology having as a basis the collection B of all sets of the form U  ×  V, where U∈GX and V∈GY.

We are ready to give definition of G-topological groups.

A G-topological group G is a group that is also a T2 G-topological space such that the multiplication map of G  ×  G into G sending x  ×  y into x  ·  y, and the inverse map of G into G sending x into x- 1, are G-continuous maps.

[formula] is a group and it forms a G-topological space under the G-topology G generated by the basis [formula]. Then [formula] is a G-topological group.

We can define G-topological subgroup using induced G-topological subspace.

Let (X,G) be a G-topological space and let Y be a subset of X. Then

[formula]

is G-topology on Y. This G-topology is called subspace G-topology induced by G into Y. It is denoted by (Y,GY).

i) A G-subspace of a T2 G-topological space is T2 again ii) Let φ:X  →  X' be a G-continuous function and let Y be a G-subspace of X. Then the restriction map φ|Y:Y  →  X' defined by φ|Y(y)  =  φ(y) is a G-continuous function again.

By last proposition we have the following result.

Any subgroup H of a G-topological group is a G-topological group again, and is called G-topological subgroup of G.

We can define morphisms of G-topological spaces.

Let φ:G  →  G' be a function. Then φ is called a morphism of G-topological groups if φ is both G-continuous and group homomorphism.

φ is a G-topological group isomorphism if it is G-homoemorphism and group homomorphism.

If we have a G-topological group isomorphism between two G-topological groups G and G' then we say that they are G-isomorphic and we denote them by [formula].

It is obvious that composition of two G-morphisms of G-topological groups is again a G-morphism. Also the identity map is a G-isomorphism. So G-topological groups and G-morhisms form a category.

Now we will discuss homogenity of generalized structures.

A G-topological space X is said to be topologically homogeneous if for any x,y∈X, there is a G-homeomorphism φ:X  →  X such that φ(x) = y.

Let G be a G-topological group and let g∈G. Then left(right) translation map Lg(Rg):G  →  G, defined by Lg(x)  =  gx(Rg(x)  =  xg), is a G-topological homeomorphism.

Here we will prove that Lg is a G-homeomorphism and similarly it can be shown that Rg is a G-homeomorphism. First we will show that Lg:G  →  G, defined by Lg(x) = gx, is G-continuous. Since Lg:G  →  G is equal to the composition of

[formula]

where ig(x) = (g,x) and m is multiplicaion map in G. Then Lg is G-continuous because ig and m are G-continuous. Here we should verify that the map ig:G  →  G  ×  G is G-continuous. For any G-open set U  ×  V, where U,V are G-open sets in G, [formula] and we know that any G-open set in product G-topology of G  ×  G can be written as a union of G-open sets of the form U  ×  V. Then ig is G-continuous. Since (Lg)- 1  =  Lg- 1 is G-continuous, the left translation map Lg:G  →  G is a G-homeomorphism.

Since, for any two points g,g'∈G, there exists a G-homeomorphism Lg'g- 1:G  →  G such that Lg'g- 1(g) = g', any G-topological group is a topologically homogenous space.

Let (X,G) be a G-topological space and let B  ⊆  G be a base for G. For x∈X, the family

[formula]

is called base at x.

By left translation Lg(O) = gO,  O∈Be, we have the following.

Let G be a G-topological group and let e∈G be the unit element of G. For g∈G, the base at g is equal to

[formula]

Let f:G  →  H be a topological group homeomorphism. If f is G-continuous at the identity eG of G, then f is G-continuous at every g∈G. Hence f is G-continuous on G.

Let g∈G be any point. Suppose that O is an G-open neighbourhood of h = f(g) in H. Since left translation Lh is a G-homeomorphism of H, there exists an G-open neighbourhood V of the identity element eH in H such that hV  ⊆  O. By G-continuity of f at eG we have a G-open neighbourhood U of eG in G such that f(U)  ⊆  V. Since Lg is a G-homeomorphism of G onto itself, the set gU is a G-openn neighbourhood of g in G, and we have that f(gU) = hf(U)  ⊆  hV  ⊆  O. Hence f is G-continuous at the point g.

Let G be a G-topological group and let H be a subgroup of G. If H contains a non-empty G-open set then H is G-open in G.

Let U be a non-empty G-open subset of G with U  ⊆  H. For every h∈H, Lh(U) = hU is G-open in G. Therefore, the subgroup [formula] is G-open in G by [formula].

Let X be a set and let Γ  ⊆  P(X). We say that Γ is a covering of X if [formula]. If X is a G-topological space and every element of Γ is G-open (or closed) then Γ is called G-open covering(respectively G-closed covering).

If a G-topological space has a G-open covering then it must be strong.

Let G be a G-topological group and let H be a subgroup of G. If H is G-open set then it is also G-closed in G.

Let Γ  =  {gH:g∈G } be the family of all left cosets of H in G. This family is a disjoint G-open covering of G by left translations. Therefore, every element of Γ, being compliment of union of all other elements, is G-closed in G. In particular, H = eH is G-closed in G.

Let G be a G-topological group and Be be a base at the identity eG of G. Then we have the following properties.

i) For every O∈Be, there is an element V∈Be such that V2  ⊆  O.

ii) For every O∈Be, there is an element V∈Be such that V- 1  ⊆  O.

iii) For every O∈Be, and for every x∈O, there is an element V∈Be such that Vx  ⊆  O.

iv) For every O∈Be, and for every x∈G, there is an element V∈Be such that xVx- 1  ⊆  O.

If G is G-topological group, then i) and ii) follow from the G-continuity of the mappings (x,y)  →  xy and x  →  x- 1 at the identity eG. Property iii) follows from the G-continuity of the left translation in G. Since Lx,Rx- 1 are G-homoeomorphisms, their composition conjugation map x  →  axa- 1 is also G-homeomorphism. By this fact we have the property iv).

Let G be a G-topological group. Then a subset U of G is called symmetric if U = U- 1

We can define G-regular space.

Let X be a G-topological space. It is said to be G-regular, if for any x∈X and any G-closed set F such that x∉F, there are two G-open sets U and V such that x∈U, F  ⊆  V and [formula].

If a G-topological group G has a base at identity eG consisting of a symmetric neighbourhood, then it is a G-regular space.

Let U be a G-open set containing the identity eG. By theorem [\ref=murad4], there is a G-open set V containing eG such that V- 1 = V and V2  ⊆  U. Then [formula], and we have [formula]. Hence a1x = a2 for some a1, a2 in V. Thus x = a1- 1a2∈V- 1V = V2  ⊆  U. It means [formula]. Since G is a homogeneous space, we get regularity of G.

Let X be a T2 G-topological space. Then for every x∈X the singleton set {x} is a G-closed set in X.

By the last result, the identity {e'} is G-closed and hence we have the following corollary.

Let φ:G  →  G' be a G-morphism, let e' be the unit element of G'. Then

[formula]

is a G-closed normal G-topological subgroup in G.

From [\cite=csaszar15] we have the following useful definition.

Let X be a G-topological space, and let A  ⊆  X. We say that x∈X is a point in G-closure of A if any G-open set U containing x intersects A.

We will use the following result of [\cite=Min11]:

Let (X,GX) and (Y,GY) be two G-topological spaces. A function f:X  →  Y is G-continuous [formula] [formula] for all B  ⊆  Y [formula] [formula] for all A  ⊆  X.

We are ready to prove the following basic result.

Let G be a G-topological group. Then G-closure of any (normal) subgroup of G is a G-topological (normal) subgroup again.

Let H be a subgroup G. First we prove that [formula] is closed under multiplication m in G. Given [formula] and for any G-open set U containing xy, by last definition, we need show that [formula]. Since m:G  ×  G  →  G is G-continuous, there exist G-open sets V and W containing x and y respectively such that m(V  ×  W)  ⊆  U. Since [formula] then we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] which implies that [formula]. Now [formula] is closed under the inverse operation because [formula] by Lemma [\ref=murad1]. Now suppose H is normal subgroup in G. Given g∈G, let γg:G  →  G be conjugation by g. i.e. [formula]. Then γg is a G-homeomorphism from G to G itself. By Lemma [\ref=murad1], we have

[formula]

It implies

[formula]

Hence [formula] is a normal subgroup of G.

Let G be a G-topological group, U a G-open subset of G, and A any subset of G. Then the set AU(respectively, UA) is G-open in G.

We know that every left translation of G is a homeomorphism. Since, [formula], the conclusion follows. A similar argument follows for UA.

Let G be a G-topological group. Then for every subset A of G and every G-open set U containing the identity element eG, A  ⊆  AU(A  ⊆  UA).

Since the inverse is G-continuous, we can find a G-open set V containing e - G such that V- 1  ⊆  U. Take [formula]. Then xV is a G-open set containing x, therefore there is [formula], that is, a = xb, for some b∈V. Then a = ab- 1∈AV- 1  ⊆  AU, hence, [formula].

Let G be a G-topological group, and Be a base of the space G at the identity element eG. Then for every subset A of G,

[formula]

In view of the theorem [\ref=murad5], we only have to verify that if x is not in [formula], then there exists U∈Be, such that x∉AU. Since [formula], then there exists a G-open W of eG such that [formula]. Take U in Be, satisfying teh condition U- 1  ⊆  W. Then [formula], which obviously implies that AU does not conatin x.

Let G be a G-topological group. Then G-closure of a symmetric subset A of G is again symmetric.

Since inverse mapping is a G-homeomorphism, [formula] and A is symmetric, [formula]. Hence [formula] is symmetric.

G-connectedness for G-Topological Groups

In this section, we will discuss basic topological properties of connectivity of G- topologicl spaces from [\cite=csaszar14].

Let X be a G-topological space and let U,V  ⊆  X. Then we say that the pair U,V is G-separated if [formula].

Let X be a G-topological space. Then X is G-connected if it can not be written as a union of two G-separated sets.

A G-topological group G, having an G-open subgroup, is not G-connected.

The connectedness for G-topological subspaces can be defined by induced subspace G-topology. From [\cite=csaszar14], we give the relation between G-continuity and G-connectedness.

Let f:X  →  Y be a G-continuous function between G-topological spaces. If X is G-connected, so is f(X).

A function f:X  →  Y between G-topological spaces is called G-open if for every G-open set U  ⊆  X, f(U) is G-open in Y.

Let f:X  →  Y be a G-open and injective function between G-topological spaces and let S  ⊆  X. If f(S) is G-connected, so is S.

Now we will give definition of G-component in G-topological space.

Let X be a G-topological space, let A  ⊆  X. For x∈A, the set

[formula]

where S is G-connected in A, is called G-component of A containing x.

From [\cite=csaszar14] we have the following theorem.

The maximal component of a G-closed set A in G-topological space X is again G-closed.

Hence the maximal component of G-topological space X is again G-closed. Then we can give the following result.

Let G be a G-topological group and let e be the unit element of G. Then the maximal connected component containing e is G-closed normal subgroup of G.

Let F be the maximal component of the identity e. By Theorem [\ref=murad2], F is G-closed.

Let a∈F. Since the multiplication and inversion functions in G are G-continuous,by [\ref=murad3], the set aF- 1 is also G-connected, and since e∈aF- 1 we must have aF- 1  ⊆  F. Hence, for every b∈F we have ab- 1∈F, i.e. F is a subgroup of G.

If g is an arbitrary element of G, then [formula] is a G-connected subset containing e. Since F is maximal, g- 1Fg  ⊆  F for every g∈G, i.e. F is a normal subgroup.

Let G be a G-connected G-topological group, and let U be a G-open set containing identity element eG such that U contains a symmetric G-open set V containing eG. Then [formula].

By induction on n and Theorem [\ref=murad6], for every positive integer n, Vn is G-open. Hence [formula] is G-open. Let [formula]. Since V is symmetric, for every positive integer n, Vn is symmetric. Hence H = H- 1. Also we have VkVl = V(k + l). Hence HH = H. So, H is a subgroup of G. Since H is a G-open subgroup of G, by Theorem [\ref=murad7], H is also G-closed. Since G is G-connected, and H is non-empty both G-closed and G-open, G = H. As V  ⊆  U, it follows that [formula].
