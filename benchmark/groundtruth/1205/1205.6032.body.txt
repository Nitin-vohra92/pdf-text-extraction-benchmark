A Remark on Chern-Weil Theory

Introduction

Consider n-dimensional real manifold M and the frame bundle RM over M. We identify bundles and their total spaces. There is the affine bundle

[formula]

of torsion free connections on RM (sections of bundle π are torsion free connections on RM).

There are natural nonzero closed complex valued differential forms

[formula]

In the theorem the adjective natural means that for every n-dimensional real manifold N and open embedding f:N  →  M we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the embedding defined by f [\cite=curv].

Suppose that D is a connection on RM and D0 is the corresponding torsion free connection on RM. So D0 is a differential mapping

[formula]

Consider 2k-forms

[formula]

From theorem [\ref=main_th] and from the fact that every connection on RM can be deformed to any other one it follows that

d(D*0(ωk(M)))  =  0;

cohomology class [formula] does not depend on the connection D.

In fact, forms D*0(ωk(M)) are exactly 2k-forms constructed in Chern-Weil theory [\cite=chern-weil]. So theorem [\ref=main_th] means that Chern-Weil theory for tensor bundles over manifolds is a consequence of existence of differential forms ωk(M).

Proof of theorem [\ref=main_th]

Let {xi} be local coordinates on an open subset X of the manifold M. The coordinates {xi} define the local coordinates [formula] on the open subset π- 1(X) of the manifold [formula]. On π- 1(X) consider 1-forms

[formula]

and construct the matrix

[formula]

Let {x'i} be local coordinates on an open subset X of the manifold M. By definition of the manifold [formula], on the intersection [formula] we have the transition formula

[formula]

On π- 1(X) consider the matrix

[formula]

whose entries are 2-forms on π- 1(X):

[formula]

We claim that on the intersection [formula] we have the transition formula

[formula]

We omit an easy check-up of this formula. In fact, it exactly looks like the check-up of the analogous classical transitional formula.

Define the forms ωk(M) by the formula

[formula]

where [formula] is the identity matrix of size n  ×  n. From [\eqref=tr_formula] it follows that forms ωk(M) are natural one on the manifold M.

Let us prove that forms ωk(M) are closed. Let [formula], {xi} be local coordinates on a neighbourhood X  ⊂  M of the point π(A), and [formula] be the corresponding local coordinates on the neighbourhood [formula] of the point A. Replacing if needed local coordinates {xi} by new ones we pass to the case when

[formula]

In this case from [\eqref=theta] it follows that

[formula]

whence we get

[formula]

From the above it follows that

[formula]

and thus forms ω(M) are closed.
