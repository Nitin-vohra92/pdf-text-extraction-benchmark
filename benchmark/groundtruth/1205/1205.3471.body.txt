Representable tolerances in varieties

Introduction

Recall that a tolerance on some algebra is a binary, compatible, symmetric and reflexive relations. Thus, a congruence is just a transitive tolerance.

It is quite surprising that the study of tolerances (apart from intrinsic interest) has revealed to be essential in the study of congruences. Indeed, present-day research shows that tolerances are becoming increasingly important even in many other at first look seemingly unrelated contexts [\cite=Ch] [\cite=CCH] [\cite=CCHL] [\cite=CG] [\cite=CHL] [\cite=CK] [\cite=Gu] [\cite=HM] [\cite=HMK] [\cite=KK] [\cite=acta] [\cite=Sm] [\cite=We].

A first example

Suppose that [formula], [formula] are algebras, and [formula] is a surjective homomorphism. It is folklore, and easy to see, that if β is a congruence on [formula], then [formula] is a tolerance Θ on [formula]. In the above situation, we say that Θ is an image of β. In case we need to specify [formula] explicitly, we shall say that Θ is the image of a congruence on [formula].

We now exemplify our methods in the particular case of lattices.

If [formula] is a lattice and Θ is a tolerance on [formula], then Θ is the image of some congruence on some subalgebra of [formula].

The partial order ≤   induced by the lattice operations is a compatible relation on L, thus also [formula] is compatible. Hence the binary relation [formula] can be considered as a subalgebra [formula] of [formula]. Let [formula] be the first projection, and β on [formula] be the kernel of the second projection.

We shall show that φ(β)  =  Θ. Indeed, if [formula], then [formula], thus [formula], since [formula]. Similarly, [formula]. Trivially, [formula], [formula], [formula], thus Θ  ⊆  φ(β).

Conversely, if (a,b)∈φ(β), then there is c∈L such that (a,c)∈B, (b,c)∈B, hence [formula], a  ≤  c, [formula], b  ≤  c, thus [formula]. Hence φ(β)  ⊆  θ, and the theorem is proved.

Notice that we have not used all the properties of a lattice, thus Theorem [\ref=lattices] allows some strengthening, see Proposition [\ref=lattgen] below. Also, the proof of Theorem [\ref=lattices] applies not only to lattices, but also to lattices with additional operations, provided the additional operations respect the lattice order, that is, the order remains a compatible relation with respect to the additional operations.

Notice also that if [formula] belongs to some variety of lattices V, then every subalgebra of [formula] belongs to V. In fact, we do not need the full assumption that V is a variety: we get that if V is a class of lattices, and V is closed under subalgebras and finite products then every tolerances on some lattice in V is the image of some congruence of some lattice in V.

Following [\cite=CCH] [\cite=CK], we say that the tolerances of V are images of its congruences if every tolerance in V is the image of a congruence in V. By G. Czédli and G. Grätzer [\cite=CG] the variety of all lattices, and by G. Czédli and E. W. Kiss [\cite=CK], every variety of lattices have the above property. Theorem [\ref=lattices] thus furnishes another proof of Czédli and E. W. Kiss result.

As we shall see in the next section, the reason why Theorem [\ref=lattices] holds is that tolerances in lattices are representable in the sense of Definition [\ref=repr], to be introduced in the next section.

Representable tolerances

Suppose that [formula] is an algebra, and R is a compatible reflexive relation on [formula]. Let R  -   denote the converse of R. It is immediate to see that [formula] is a tolerance on [formula]. Tolerances which are representable in the form [formula] as above have been called representable in [\cite=acta], where it has been shown, among other things, that not every tolerance is representable. See [\cite=acta] for more on representable tolerances.

If Θ is a representable tolerance on the algebra [formula], then Θ is the image of a congruence on some subalgebra of [formula].

Suppose that Θ is representable as [formula], for R a reflexive compatible relation on [formula]. Let [formula] be R itself, considered as a subalgebra of [formula], and let φ be the first projection. Since R is reflexive, we have that φ is surjective. Let β on [formula] be the kernel of the second projection, that is, (a,b)β(c,d) if and only if b = d. We shall show that φ(β) = Θ.

Indeed, for every a,c∈A, and since [formula], the following is a chain of equivalent conditions.

[formula];

There is b∈A such that (a,b)∈R and (b,c)∈R  -  ;

There is b∈A such that (a,b),(c,b)∈R.

There is b∈A such that (a,b),(c,b)∈B (thus, (a,b)β(c,b)).

(a,c)∈φ(β).

We have shown that Θ  =  φ(β), thus the theorem is proved.

G. Czédli observed that every tolerance on a lattice is representable, as a consequence of Lemma 2 in [\cite=Clattices]. Cf. also [\cite=CZ]. See [\cite=acta] and Proposition [\ref=lattgen] below, for some slightly more general results. Hence Theorem [\ref=lattices] is actually a particular case of Theorem [\ref=thm]. We have given a direct proof of Theorem [\ref=lattices] since it is relatively short and simple.

It has been shown in [\cite=CCHL] [\cite=CK] that every tolerance on some algebra [formula] is the image of some congruence β, for appropriate [formula] and φ. However, in most cases, [formula] belongs to some specified variety V, and it is a natural request to ask that [formula], too, belongs to V. This observation justifies the next definition.

A note on terminology: we shall say that a tolerance Θ is in a variety V to mean that Θ is a tolerance on some algebra [formula]. Technically, this is justified since a tolerance on [formula] can be seen as a subalgebra of [formula] (and Θ and [formula] generate the same variety, since, in the above sense, [formula] is isomorphic to a substructure of Θ). A similar remark applies to congruences in place of tolerance.

If Θ is a tolerance on [formula], we say that Θ is the image of a congruence in V if it is possible to chose [formula], β a congruence on [formula], and [formula] a surjective homomorphism such that Θ  =  φ(β).

The above definition is a local version of the mentioned notion from [\cite=CCH] [\cite=CK] that the tolerances of V are images of its congruences.

Though in the above definitions V is intended to stand for a variety, our results generally hold for an arbitrary class V which is closed under taking subalgebras and products, in particular, for quasivarieties. Actually, in most cases, it is enough to assume that V is closed under taking subalgebras and finite products.

As an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm], we get:

If all tolerances in the variety V are representable, then the tolerances of V are the images of its congruences (actually, it is enough to suppose that V is closed under taking subalgebras and finite products).

The converse of Corollary [\ref=thmim] is not true. By [\cite=CCHL] [\cite=CK], in every variety defined by the empty set of equations the tolerances of V are the images of its congruences, but, by [\cite=acta] (see also Proposition [\ref=ex] below), there exists a non representable tolerance on some algebra (which trivially belongs to a variety defined by an empty set of equations).

However, it is possible to show that, within a given variety, a tolerance is the image of some congruence if and only if it is the image of some representable tolerance (see Corollary [\ref=imtol] below). This can be useful, since if we want to show that, for a variety V, the tolerances of V are the images of its congruences, it is enough to show that the tolerances of V are the images of its representable tolerances.

Weakly representable tolerances

There is a version of Theorem [\ref=thm] dealing with a more general notion of representability.

Let λ be a nonzero cardinal.

We say that a tolerance is λ-weakly representable if it is the intersection of at most λ representable tolerances.

A tolerance is weakly representable if it is λ-weakly representable, for some nonzero cardinal λ. Thus, representable is the same as 1-weakly representable. See again [\cite=acta] for more informations about weakly representable tolerances.

In the statement of the next theorem, +   denotes cardinal sum, that is, λ + 1 = λ, if λ is infinite.

If Θ is a λ-weakly representable tolerance on the algebra [formula], then Θ is the image of a congruence on some subalgebra of the power [formula].

Hence, if V is a class closed under subalgebras and products (in particular, if V is a variety), then every weakly representable tolerance belonging to V is the image of a congruence in V.

Suppose that [formula], where each Θi has the form [formula], for certain reflexive compatible relations Ri. Let [formula] be the subalgebra of [formula] whose base set is [formula]. The assumption that each Ri is compatible implies that [formula] is indeed a subalgebra of [formula].

Let [formula] be the first projection, and let β be the kernel of the second projection [formula]. The same arguments as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm] show that φ(β)  =  Θ.

The converse of Theorem [\ref=propweakly] does not hold, in general; see Proposition [\ref=ex]. However, we expect that the converse of Theorem [\ref=propweakly] is true, under some mild assumptions on [formula] or V.

Theorem [\ref=propweakly] gives us the possibility of improving Corollary [\ref=thmim].

If all tolerances in a variety V are weakly representable, then the tolerances of V are the images of its congruences (indeed, it is enough to assume that V is closed under subalgebras and arbitrary products).

Extending Definition [\ref=reprhom] in the natural way, if [formula] and [formula] are algebras, we say that a tolerance Θ on [formula] is the image of some tolerance Ψ on [formula] if there is some surjective homomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. It is trivial to see that the image of some tolerance, in the above sense, is again a tolerance.

If Θ, Ψ and Φ are tolerances, Θ is an image of Ψ, and Ψ is an image of Φ, then Θ is an image of Φ.

Let Θ be on [formula], Ψ be on [formula], and Φ be on [formula], and let the assumption of the lemma be witnessed by surjective homomorphisms [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] witnesses that Θ is an image of Φ.

Let V be a class of algebras closed under subalgebras and products (in particular, a variety). For every tolerance Θ in V, the following conditions are equivalent.

Θ is the image of a congruence in V.

Θ is the image of a representable tolerance in V.

Θ is the image of a weakly representable tolerance in V.

In particular, for every V as above, the tolerances of V are the images of its congruences if and only if the tolerances of V are the images of its (weakly) representable tolerances.

(1) ⇒   (2) and (2) ⇒   (3) are trivial, since every congruence β is representable (as [formula]), and since every representable tolerance is weakly representable.

(3) ⇒   (1) If Θ is the image of a weakly representable tolerance Ψ in V, then, by Theorem [\ref=propweakly], Ψ is the image of some congruence β in V, hence, by Lemma [\ref=3tol], Θ is the image of β.

Suppose that Θ is a tolerance on the algebra [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent.

Θ is the image of a congruence on some subalgebra of some power [formula], for some set I.

For every variety V such that [formula], Θ is the image of a congruence in V.

Θ is the image of a congruence in [formula], the variety generated by [formula].

In all the preceding conditions we can equivalently replace the word "congruence" with either "representable tolerance" or "weakly representable tolerance".

(1) ⇒   (2) is obvious, since if [formula], then every subalgebra of [formula] is in V.

(2) ⇒   (3) is trivial.

(3) ⇒   (1) Let Θ be an image of γ, a congruence on [formula]. By the HSP characterization of [formula], there are a set I, an algebra [formula], and a surjective homomorphism [formula]. Then [formula] is a congruence on [formula], and φ(β) = γ, in the sense of Definition [\ref=reprhom].

Thus Θ is an image of γ, which is an image of β, hence, by Lemma [\ref=3tol], Θ is an image of β, a congruence on [formula], and (1) is proved.

The last statement is immediate from Corollary [\ref=imtol].

Additional remarks

We first provide a generalization of Theorem [\ref=lattices]. Its proof exploits exactly the only properties of lattices which were used in the proof of [\ref=lattices].

Suppose that [formula] is an algebra with two binary operations [formula] and [formula] (among possibly other operations), and with a compatible binary relation M, which satisfy the following conditions:

[formula], for every a∈A.

[formula], and [formula], for every a,b∈A.

[formula], for every a,c∈A such that [formula].

Then every tolerance Θ of [formula] is representable, and is an image of some congruence on some subalgebra of [formula].

Same as the proof of Theorem [\ref=lattices], using M in place of ≤  : Θ is representable as [formula], with [formula]. The last statement is immediate from Theorem [\ref=thm].

Condition (2) in Proposition [\ref=lattgen] is satisfied in case M is defined by and [formula] satisfies [formula] and [formula], for every a,b∈A.

By Proposition [\ref=lattgen], and writing explicitly the condition that the M given by Remark [\ref=rmkcasin] is compatible, we get:

Suppose that [formula] is an algebra with (exactly) two binary operations [formula] and [formula] satisfying the following conditions:

For every a,a',b,b'∈A, if [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and [formula].

[formula], for every a∈A.

[formula], and [formula], for every a,b∈A.

For every a,c∈A, if [formula], then [formula].

Then every tolerance Θ of [formula] is representable, and is an image of some congruence on some subalgebra of [formula].

We now show that the conditions exploited in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm] actually characterize representable tolerances.

Suppose that Θ is a tolerance on the algebra [formula]. Then Θ is representable if and only if Θ can be realized as the image of a congruence on some subalgebra [formula] of [formula], such that [formula] contains Δ  =  {(a,a)|a∈A}, and in such a way that φ and β in Definition [\ref=reprhom] can be chosen to be, respectively, the first projection and the kernel of the second projection.

The construction used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm] shows that if Θ is representable, then [formula], φ and β can be chosen to satisfy the desired requirements.

Conversely, suppose that we have [formula], φ and β satisfying the conditions in the statement of the proposition. Being a subalgebra of [formula], [formula] can be thought of as a compatible relation on [formula]. We shall take R = B. Since B contains Δ, then R is reflexive. By assumption, [formula] if and only if (a,c)∈φ(β). Noticing that the equivalence of items (5) and (2) in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm] holds also in the present situation, we get that [formula] if and only if there is b∈A such that (a,b)∈R and (b,c)∈R  -  . This means exactly that [formula].

We now show that the converse of Theorem [\ref=propweakly] fails in a large class of algebras.

For every set A, and every reflexive and symmetric relation Θ on A which is not transitive, there is an algebra [formula] with base set A and such that Θ is a tolerance on [formula] which is not weakly representable, but Θ is the image of some congruence on some subalgebra of some power of [formula].

For every a,b∈A such that [formula], and for every function f:A  →  {a,b}, add to A a unary function symbols representing f. It is easy to see that Θ is a tolerance on the algebra thus obtained, and that Θ is not weakly representable. Indeed, every nontrivial compatible relation R on [formula] contains Θ, and, since Θ is not transitive, then [formula] (see [\cite=acta] for more details).

Consider [formula], the variety generated by [formula]. Since [formula] is unary, then, by [\cite=CK], tolerances are images of congruences in [formula]. Then Corollary [\ref=equiv](3) ⇒   (1) implies that Θ is the image of some congruence on some subalgebra of some power of [formula].

On the other hand, under certain conditions, the converse of Theorem [\ref=propweakly] does hold.

Suppose that [formula] is an algebra in a 3-permutable variety V, and Θ is a tolerance on [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent.

Θ is representable.

Θ is weakly representable.

Θ is the image of some congruence on some subalgebra of [formula].

Θ is the image of some congruence in [formula].

Θ is a congruence of [formula].

If we only assume that every subalgebra of [formula] has 3-permutable congruences, then Conditions (1), (3) and (5) above are still equivalent.

(1) ⇒   (2) and (3) ⇒   (4) are trivial.

(1) ⇒   (3) and (2) ⇒   (4) follow from, respectively, Theorems [\ref=thm] and [\ref=propweakly].

(4) ⇒   (5) Clearly [formula], being a subvariety of V, is 3-permutable, too, hence Θ is the image of some congruence on some algebra with 3-permuting congruences. But it is well-known that this implies that Θ is a congruence, see Theorem 1.10 in [\cite=J].

(5) ⇒   (1) is trivial, since if Θ is a congruence, then [formula].

Under the assumption that every subalgebra of [formula] has 3-permutable congruences, (3) ⇒   (5) holds, again by Theorem 1.10 in [\cite=J]. The implications (1) ⇒   (3) and (5) ⇒   (1) do not use 3-permutability at all.

We expect that parts of Proposition [\ref=3perm] hold under assumptions weaker than 3-permutability. However, globally (that is, if we ask that the conditions hold for every tolerance in a 3-permutable variety), Proposition [\ref=3perm] is essentially an empty result, in the sense that the conditions hold only in permutable varieties (in which they are trivially true).

Suppose that V is an n-permutable variety, for some n. Then the following conditions are equivalent.

Every tolerance in V is weakly representable.

Every tolerance in V is representable.

Every tolerance in V is the image of a congruence in V.

V is permutable.

Every tolerance in V is a congruence.

(1) ⇒   (2) and (5) ⇒   (1) are trivial.

(2) ⇒   (3) follows from Theorem [\ref=thmim].

(3) ⇒   (4) is [\cite=CK].

(4) ⇒   (5) is immediate from a classical result from [\cite=We], parts of which are due independently to G. Hutchinson [\cite=Hu]. Actually, Conditions (4) and (5) are equivalent for every variety, as follows easily from the above papers, and explicitly stated, e. g., in [\cite=Ch].

Notice that, again by [\cite=CZ] [\cite=Clattices], tolerances in lattices satisfy a property stronger than representability. Indeed, if Θ is a tolerance on a lattice [formula], then

[formula]

or even

[formula]

(just take [formula], [formula] and [formula])

Which parts of the theory of tolerances on lattices follow just from the assumption ([\ref=eq]) or ([\ref=eqm])?

Notice that we do not need all the axioms for lattices, in order to get ([\ref=eq]) above: the properties listed in Proposition [\ref=lattgen], together with their duals suffice.
