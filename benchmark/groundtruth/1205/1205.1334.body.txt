On the metric dimension, the upper dimension and the resolving number of graphs

Antonio Gonz�lez* Alberto M�rquez*

Introduction

In this paper, we study resolving sets for finite simple connected graphs. They were introduced in the 1970s independently by Slater [\cite=slater], and Harary and Melter [\cite=melter]. The usefulness of these sets comes from their multiple applications in several areas, among them: coin weighing problems, network discovery and verification, robot navigation, strategies for Mastermind game and chemical industry (we refer the reader to [\cite=cartesian] for a number of references on this topic). Resolving sets are formally defined as follows.

Let G = (V(G),E(G)) be a finite, simple, connected graph of order n = |V(G)|. The distance d(u,v) between two vertices u,v∈V(G) is the length of a shortest u-v path in G. A vertex u∈V(G) resolves a pair {x,y}  ⊂  V(G) if d(u,x)  ≠  d(u,y). A set of vertices S  ⊆  V(G) is a resolving set of G if every pair of vertices of G is resolved by some vertex of S. A resolving set S of minimum size is a metric basis, and |S| is the metric dimension of G, denoted by [formula].

Our aim is not only to deal with metric bases and metric dimension but also with two other resolving parameters defined by Chartrand et al. [\cite=upper], the upper dimension and the resolving number, that give an insight of how dense the set of resolving sets of a graph is.

A resolving set S of G is minimal if no proper subset of S is a resolving set. An upper basis is a minimal resolving set containing the maximum number of vertices. The upper dimension  dim+(G) is the size of an upper basis. The resolving number res(G) is the minimum k such that every k-subset of V(G) is a resolving set of G.

Clearly, every (n  -  1)-subset of V(G) is a resolving set and every resolving set contains a minimal resolving set. Hence,

[formula]

When [formula], the graph G is called randomly k-dimensional, that is, every subset of size k is a metric basis and so G has the maximum number of metric bases.

Chartrand and Zhang [\cite=chrom] posed the problem of characterizing the randomly k-dimensional graphs. They solved the case k  ≤  2, obtaining the complete graphs K1 and K2 (for k = 1) and odd cycles (for k = 2) which includes as a particular case the complete graph K3. Nevertheless, it remained open the main following question.

Are there randomly k-dimensional graphs other than complete graphs and odd cycles?

Concerning the three parameters, Chartrand et al. [\cite=upper] investigated some relationships among them. They proved that every pair a,b of integers with 2  ≤  a  ≤  b is realizable as the metric dimension and the resolving number, respectively, of some connected graph G. It was also shown the analogous result for  dim(G) =  dim+(G) = a and [formula]. Moreover, the authors proved that every pair among the three parameters can differ by an arbitrarily large number. Thus, as remarked in [\cite=upper], there was reason to believe that every pair a,b of integers with 2  ≤  a  ≤  b is realizable as the metric dimension and the upper dimension, respectively, of some connected graph. This remained as a conjecture.

For every pair a,b of integers with 2  ≤  a  ≤  b, there exists a connected graph G with  dim(G)  =  a and  dim+(G)  =  b.

In this paper, we provide a combinatorial proof avoiding the brute force casuistic analysis to solve Problem [\ref=problem] (see Theorem [\ref=charact]). We also prove in the affirmative Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] (see Theorem [\ref=ab]) and show that no integer a  ≥  4 is realizable as the resolving number of an infinite family of graphs (see Theorem [\ref=resfinite]).

Graphs G with [formula].

In this section, we characterize the randomly k-dimensional graphs. The main difficulty in this problem is to avoid the casuistic analysis resulting from the intuitive idea of considering metric bases formed by k vertices close to a given vertex, and then to try to extend this local argument to the whole graph. In fact, while preparing this paper, we have learnt of [\cite=ckrandom], where the authors prove the same result going through this type of analysis and using also results related to the degree of the vertices, the connectivity and the induced subgraphs. Here, we present an alternative proof based on combinatorial arguments.

We start with some technical lemmas needed for the case k = 3. Denote by Pλ(V(G)) the λ-subsets of V(G) and let Ni(u) be the set of vertices at distance i from u∈V(G). For {u,v},{x,y}∈P2(V(G)) we say that the pair {u,v} resolves the pair {x,y} if either u or v resolves it.

Let G be a randomly 3-dimensional graph. Then, the following statements hold.

For every pair {u,v}∈P2(V(G)) there exist unique pairs {x,y},{r,s}∈P2(V(G)) such that {x,y} is not resolved by {u,v}, and {u,v} is not resolved by {r,s}.

Every vertex u∈V(G) satisfies that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the eccentricity of u, i.e., the maximum distance from u to any other vertex.

To prove Statement (a), consider a graph G verifying that [formula]. Clearly, for every pair of vertices {u,v} there is a pair {x,y} that is not resolved by {u,v} (otherwise [formula]. Suppose on the contrary that there are two pairs {u,v},{ũ,ṽ} that have the same associated pair {x,y}∈P2(V(G)), i.e., {x,y} is not resolved by either {u,v} or {ũ,ṽ}, and assume that u,v  ≠  ũ. Then the set {u,v,ũ} is not a metric basis, which is a contradiction. It is analogous to prove that there is a unique pair {r,s}∈P2(V(G)) such that {u,v} is not resolved by {r,s}. Hence, the result follows.

As a consequence of Statement (a) we have that the size of the set of non-resolved pairs by a vertex u∈V(G) is equal to n - 1 (it suffices to consider the n - 1 distinct pairs {u,v} with [formula]). This set is formed by pairs of vertices at the same distance from u and so its size is equal to [formula], which proves Statement (b).

Fixed u∈V(G), consider the partition [formula] of V(G) into classes (where N0(u) = {u}). Lemma [\ref=keylemma](b) says that there is a compensation between vertices of [formula] and pairs of vertices located in the same class of P(u). For instance, classes of size at least 4 always contribute to Equation [\ref=eq1] with more pairs than vertices (6 pairs and 4 vertices in case of size 4) and so they have to be compensated with classes of size at most 2 whose contribution is bigger in terms of vertices than in pairs. Note that classes of size 3 which contribute with 3 pairs, are self-compensated. Therefore, the existence of a class of size at least 4 in the partition P(u) is equivalent to the existence of at least two classes of size at most 2.

The following straightforward lemma will be useful for the proofs of this paper.

Let u,v,w∈V(G) such that {v,w}∈E(G) and d(u,v) = d. Then d(u,w)∈{d - 1,d,d + 1}.

Lemma [\ref=keylemma] and Remark [\ref=remark] are the key tools to prove the following lemma which let us avoid the casuistic analysis to characterize the randomly 3-dimensional graphs.

Let G be a randomly 3-dimensional graph of order n. Then, G is 3-regular and n∈{4,7,10}.

First, observe that G does not contain vertices of degree 1. Indeed, if a vertex u has a unique neighbour v, then the pair {u,v} is resolved by every vertex of G, which contradicts Lemma [\ref=keylemma](a).

Claim 1. The degree of every vertex of G is at most 3.

Suppose on the contrary that there exists u∈V(G) of degree at least 4 and let u1,u2,u3,u4∈N1(u). By Lemma [\ref=keylemma](a), each set Aij  =  {v∈V(G)  |  d(v,ui) = d(v,uj)} with 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  4 contains exactly two vertices of G. Moreover, Lemma [\ref=landmarks] implies that every vertex of G belongs to at least one of the six sets Aij. Hence, n  ≤  7 since u∈Aij for all i,j.

Consider now the partition P(u) in which N1(u) is a class of size at least 4. By Remark [\ref=remark], there are at least two classes of size at most 2. Even more, since n  ≤  7 then there are exactly two classes of size 1 and so the furthest vertex from u has degree 1; a contradiction. Therefore, every vertex of G has degree at most 3.

Claim 2. n∈{4,7,10}.

Since [formula] then G is neither a path nor a cycle and so there is a vertex u∈V(G) of degree 3 with neighbours, say u1,u2,u3. Arguing as in the proof of Claim 1 (defining the analogous sets Aij but for the vertices u,u1,u2,u3) we have that n  ≤  10.

The sets {u} and {u1,u2,u3} are the classes N0(u) and N1(u), respectively, in the partition P(u). If this partition does not contain more classes, then n = 4. Otherwise, Remark [\ref=remark] says that the existence of a class of size at least 4 is equivalent to the existence of at least two classes of size at most 2, and classes of size 3 are self-compensated. Since n  ≤  10, it is easy to check that there are two possibilities for P(u): (1) a class of size 4 and two classes of size 1 (plus N0(u) and N1(u)); (2) two classes of size 3 (one being N1(u)). This gives n = 10 and n = 7, respectively.

Claim 3. There is no vertex of degree 2.

Suppose on the contrary that there is a vertex u∈V(G) of degree 2. Then, |N1(u)| = 2. By Remark [\ref=remark], P(u) contains a class of size at least 4 and another class of size at most 2. Since n  ≤  10 we have the following two possibilities for P(u): (1) one class of size 4, two classes of size 1 and one class of size 2; (2) one class of size 4, one class of size 1 and two classes of size 2. This gives, respectively, n = 8 and n = 9 which contradicts Claim 2.

The three previous claims prove that a graph G of order n satisfying [formula] is 3-regular and n∈{4,7,10}.

Now, we reach the desired characterization that solves Problem [\ref=problem].

A graph G is randomly k-dimensional if and only if G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.

If G is isomorphic to a complete graph or an odd cycle, it is straightforward to prove that G is randomly k-dimensional.

Suppose now that G is a graph of order n satisfying [formula] k. We can assume k  ≥  3 (as it was said before the case k  ≤  2 is proved in [\cite=chrom], obtaining the complete graphs K1 and K2 (for k = 1) and odd cycles (for k = 2)). Suppose first that k = 3 and so [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=regularity], G is 3-regular and n∈{4,7,10}. We shall now prove that n = 4.

Clearly, n  ≠  7 since there is no 3-regular graph with 7 vertices. Consider now two vertices u,v∈V(G) so that d(u,v) = d(G), where d(G) denotes the diameter of G. Let N1(u) = {u1,u2,u3}. By Lemma [\ref=landmarks], the distance from v to every vertex of the set {u,u1,u2,u3} is either d(G) or d(G) - 1. Hence, v belongs to at least two of the sets Aij defined as in the proof of Claim 1 but for the vertices u,u1,u2,u3. By Lemma [\ref=keylemma](a), each set contains exactly two vertices of G and u belongs to three of them. This gives n < 10 and so n = 4 which implies that G is isomorphic to K4 (the only 3-regular graph with 4 vertices).

Suppose now that k  ≥  4 and assume [formula] k. Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=keylemma](a) we have that for every T∈Pk - 1(V(G)), the non-empty set

[formula]

verifies that [formula] whenever T  ≠  T'. Therefore |Pk - 1(V(G))|  ≤  |P2(V(G))|, i.e.,

[formula]

Hence k = n - 1 since 4  ≤  k =  dim (G). This implies that G is isomorphic to the complete graph Kn which is the only graph verifying that [formula].

Realization of graphs

Realization of the metric dimension and the upper dimension

This subsection is devoted to prove in the affirmative Conjecture [\ref=conjecture]. In order to do this, we compute the upper dimension of two families of graphs for which the metric dimension is easily obtained. These graphs are constructed from the grid graphs attaching at the origin either a triangle or a number of pendant vertices. We start with some notation and technical lemmas.

Let [formula] be the 2-dimensional grid graph of size [formula] with [formula], whose vertex set is the cartesian product ×  [null] and distances given by d((x1,x2),(y1,y2)) = |x1 - y1| + |x2 - y2|. We shall use x1,x2 to indicate the coordinates of a vertex [formula] (analogously y = (y1,y2), z = (z1,z2), r = (r1,r2), etc.) The following sets of vertices are called quadrants of [formula]:

[formula]

[formula]

and the sets [formula] for [formula] are the diagonals of [formula] (see Figure [\ref=quadrants](a)). A pair of vertices {x,y} is said to be a diagonal pair if x,y∈Di for some i. Note that a quadrant Qi(x) might be equal to {x} and there is a total order <  i in each diagonal Di (or simply "<  " when no confusion can arise) given by

In the sequel, we shall assume without loss of generality that the order of the two elements of a diagonal pair {x,y} is x < y (analogously r < s for {r,s} or t < z for {t,z}).

Let R(x,y) be the set of vertices of [formula] that resolve the pair [formula], and let S be a resolving set of [formula]. Note that the set [formula] is non-empty for every pair {x,y}.

Let {x,y} be a diagonal pair such that d(x,y) = 2. Then,

[formula]

Every vertex u∈Q2(x) has a shortest u-y path through x and so d(u,y) = d(u,x) + d(x,y) = d(u,x) + 2. Thus, u resolves {x,y} (analogous for u∈Q4(y)).

Let [formula], z = (x1,y2) and  = (y1,x2). Clearly, there are two shortest paths P1,P2 joining u to x and u to y, respectively, such that either z∈P1,P2 or ∈P1,P2 (see Figure [\ref=quadrants](b)). Since z, do not resolve the pair {x,y} then u∉R(x,y) .

A pair {x,y} is said to be S-unique if there is a unique vertex u∈S resolving {x,y}, i.e., [formula]. The vertex u is called the associated vertex of the pair {x,y}. The following remark is straightforward.

Let {x,y} be an S-unique pair with associated vertex u. If there is a pair {r,s} such that R(r,s)  ⊆  R(x,y) then {r,s} is S-unique with associated vertex u.

Let {x,y}  =  {(x1,x2),(y1,y2)} be an S-unique diagonal pair with associated vertex u such that d(x,y) > 2. Then there exist y1 - x1 S-unique diagonal pairs {r,s} with associated vertex u and d(r,s) = 2.

A similar argument as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma1], considering z = (x1,y2) and  = (y1,x2) gives that every vertex [formula] does not resolve the pair {x,y}. We have to add the vertices (x1 + j,  y2 + j) with 0 < j  <  y1 - x1 which clearly do not resolve the pair {x,y} either (see Figure [\ref=pairs](a)). Thus, the expression of R(x,y) for vertices at distance bigger than 2 is

[formula]

This set can also be expressed as follows:

[formula]

where rj = (x1 + j,y2 + j + 1), sj = (x1 + j + 1,y2 + j) and d(rj,sj) = 2 (see Figure [\ref=pairs](b)). Since R(rj,sj)  ⊆  R(x,y), by Remark [\ref=contencion], the result holds.

Two diagonal pairs {x,y}, {r,s} with d(x,y) = d(r,s) = 2 are said to be in the same row if x2 = r2 and y2 = s2. Analogously, they are in the same column if x1 = r1 and y1 = s1.

Let {x,y} be an S-unique diagonal pair with associated vertex u such that d(x,y) = 2. If there exist two S-unique diagonal pairs {r,s}, {t,z} in the same row (column) than {x,y} with associated vertices, respectively, v and w and u  ≠  v,w then v = w.

Suppose that the pairs {r,s}, {t,z} are in the same row (analogous for columns) than {x,y}, i.e., x2 = r2 = t2 and y2 = s2 = z2. Assume also that x1 < r1  <  t1. Clearly, [formula] and so v = w since v  ≠  u.

Now, we reach our main result in this subsection which answers in the affirmative Conjecture [\ref=conjecture].

For every pair a,b of integers with 2  ≤  a  ≤  b, there exists a connected graph G with [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be the graph obtained from [formula], [formula], by attaching a triangle at the vertex (0,0), i.e., [formula] and [formula]. Observe that distances in [formula] behave as in [formula], except for the new vertices α and β for which d(α,x) = d(β,x) = x1 + x2 + 1 for every [formula]. Thus, the previous lemmas can be applied to the graph [formula].

Claim 1. [formula] and [formula].

It is well-known that [formula] being the set [formula] a metric basis (see for instance [\cite=landmarks]). This set can be adapted to a metric basis of [formula] by considering [formula]. Hence, [formula].

To prove that [formula] one can easily check that the set

[formula]

is a resolving set of [formula] of size [formula]. Moreover, S is minimal because removing either a vertex (x1,x1) or (x1,x1 + 1) from S gives that either the pair {(x1,x1),(x1 - 1,x1 + 1)} or the pair {(x1,x1 + 1),(x1 + 1,x1)} is not resolved by any element of S. Clearly, (0,1) and α cannot be removed from S. Figure [\ref=metricbasis](a) illustrates this minimal resolving set of [formula].

We next prove that [formula]. Let S be a minimal resolving set of [formula] and consider the pair {α,β} which is only resolved by either α or β and so we can assume that α∈S (otherwise β∈S).

Since S is minimal, every vertex u∈S has an associated S-unique pair, say p(u). Observe that {β,(0,0)} is not an S-unique pair (every vertex of [formula] resolves it) and so there is no vertex u∈S so that p(u) = {β,(0,0)}. Note also that α resolves all the non-diagonal pairs of [formula]. Hence, every vertex [formula] has an associated S-unique diagonal pair p(u). Moreover, by Lemma [\ref=lemma2], we can assume that the elements of p(u) are at distance 2. Thus, Lemma [\ref=lemma3] says that [formula] and so we still need to reduce the bound in one unit.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma1], [formula]. Assume that there is a vertex [formula] (analogous for [formula] by rotating the situation). Since all the pairs in the same row than {(0,1),(1,0)} are resolved by v and S is minimal, there is no other vertex of S associated to pairs in such row and so [formula] which leads to [formula], the expected bound.

Consider now the graph [formula] obtained from [formula] by attaching a set of m  ≥  2 pendant vertices {α1,...,αm} at (0,0).

Claim 2. [formula] and [formula].

As it was said before, the set [formula] is a metric basis of [formula] [\cite=landmarks]. Thus, it can be easily checked that the set [formula] is a resolving set of [formula] which gives [formula]. To prove that [formula] it suffices to show that |S|  ≥  m + 1 for every metric basis S.

A metric basis S has to contain all the pendant vertices but at most one. Suppose that {α1,...,αm - 1}  ⊂  S and αm∉S (if {α1,...,αm}  ⊂  S the result clearly follows). Since no pendant vertex resolves the pair {(0,1),(1,0)} then there is a vertex, say [formula]. But either the pair {αm,(1,0)} or the pair {αm,(0,1)} is not resolved by any vertex in the set {α1,...,αm - 1,u} and so |S|  ≥  m + 1.

Mimicking the proof of Claim 1, only replacing α by [formula] (compare Figures [\ref=metricbasis](a) and [\ref=metricbasis](b)) it is proved that [formula]. We omit it for the sake of brevity.

Claims 1 and 2 give the connected graph G with [formula] and [formula] whenever a = 2 and b even ([formula] for [formula]) or a > 2 and b - a odd ([formula] for [formula] and m = a - 1).

In order to obtain the graph G in the remaining cases, we modify slightly the graphs [formula] and [formula] by removing the set of vertices [formula]. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the resulting graphs. Note that a [formula] grid, say [formula], plays now the role of [formula] but all the tools developed above can also be applied in this case. Hence, one can follow the proofs of Claims 1 and 2 to compute the metric dimension and the upper dimension of [formula] and [formula]. There are only three changes: (1) take the set [formula] as a metric basis of [formula]; (2) remove the vertex [formula] from S obtaining a minimal resolving set of size [formula] (for [formula]) or [formula] (for [formula]); (3) apply the column version of Lemma [\ref=lemma3] to obtain [formula] or [formula] which directly gives [formula] (for [formula]) or [formula] (for [formula]). Thus, we have

Claim 3. [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula].

It gives the graph G with [formula] and [formula] whenever a = 2 and b odd ([formula] for [formula]) or a > 2 and b - a even ([formula] for [formula] and m = a - 1).

Realization of the resolving number

In Subsection 3.1, we have proved that any pair a,b of integers such that 2  ≤  a  ≤  b is realizable as the metric dimension and the upper dimension of a certain graph. Modifying slightly the above constructions, one can easily prove that these two integers are realizable as the metric dimension and the upper dimension of an infinite family of graphs. It suffices to replace the vertex (0,0) in [formula] by a path of arbitrary length. If the resulting graph plays the role of [formula] in the study developed in the previous subsection, then the metric dimension and upper dimension are preserved.

Theorem [\ref=resfinite] below says that, unlike the metric dimension and the upper dimension, no integer a  ≥  4 is realizable as an infinite family of graphs with resolving number equal to a (note that the path P2 is the only graph with resolving number 1 but there are infinite families of graphs with resolving number 2 and 3, concretely, odd cycles and paths (for a = 2) and even cycles (for a = 3)). In order to prove this result, we first relate the resolving number to the diameter of a graph, which is of independent interest.

Let G be a graph with diameter d(G), girth [formula] and resolving number [formula]. If G is not an even cycle then [formula]

Let us denote [formula]. Suppose on the contrary that [formula]. Then we can assume that there are two vertices u, v such that d(u,v) = 3r - 4 = 3(r - 1) - 1. Consider a shortest u-v path [formula] and suppose that there is a vertex [formula] attached at some vertex ui with i  ≠  1,3(r - 1) (otherwise it can be easily checked that {u1,...,ur} is not a resolving set). Clearly, every vertex uj∈P does not resolve either {w,ui - 1} or {w,ui} or {w,ui + 1}. Indeed, assume i  ≤  j (analogous for i > j). By Lemma [\ref=landmarks], uj does not resolve at least one pair among those formed by the vertices ui - 1,ui,ui + 1,w. Moreover, the pairs {ui - 1,ui}, {ui - 1,ui + 1} and {ui,ui + 1} are all resolved by uj, since P is a shortest path. Thus, one pair among {w,ui - 1}, {w,ui}, {w,ui + 1} is not resolved by uj.

Consider now the sets A = {uj∈P:d(uj,w) = d(uj,ui - 1)}, B = {uj∈P:d(uj,w) = d(uj,ui)} and C = {uj∈P:d(uj,w) = d(uj,ui + 1)}. Since these sets are not resolving sets of G, then |A|,|B|,|C|  ≤  r - 1. Furthermore, [formula] and |P| = 3(r - 1) and so |A| = |B| = |C| = r - 1 which implies that A, B and C are pairwise disjoint but [formula]; a contradiction.

Observe that when [formula] or G is an even cycle, Proposition [\ref=relationships] does not hold. It suffices to consider the path P2 (for [formula]), an odd cycle of length at least 5 (for [formula]) and an even cycle of length at least 6 (for [formula]).

For every integer a  ≥  4, the set of graphs with resolving number a is finite.

A graph G of order n, diameter d(G) and metric dimension [formula] satisfies the following relation [\cite=landmarks]:

[formula]

Since [formula] then

[formula]

and Proposition [\ref=relationships] gives

[formula]

This upper bound for n depends only on the value of a and so the result follows.

Concluding remarks and open questions

In this paper, we have characterized the randomly k-dimensional graphs. Our proof is based on combinatorial arguments which let us avoid the brute force casuistic analysis. Moreover, we have also proved in the affirmative a conjecture posed by Chartrand et al. [\cite=upper] claiming that every pair a,b of integers with 2  ≤  a  ≤  b is realizable as the metric dimension and the upper dimension, respectively, of some connected graph. We have concluded the paper showing that, surprisingly, no integer a  ≥  4 is realizable as the resolving number of an infinite family of graphs.

It would be interesting to study the realization of triples of integers a, b, c as the metric dimension, the upper dimension and the resolving number, respectively, of some connected graph. Also, the question of bounding the size of the set of graphs (maybe restricting to specific families) with given resolving number a remains open.
