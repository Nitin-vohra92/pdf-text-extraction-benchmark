Variation of the modulus of a foliation

Introduction

Modulus, an inverse of extremal length, of a family of a plane curves is a conformal invariant [\cite=ab]. The notion of a modulus can be generalized to any family of submanifolds [\cite=bf] [\cite=bl1] and, hence, to a foliation. Roughly speaking, the p-modulus  modp(F) of a k-dimensional foliation on a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold is the infimum of p-th norm over all nonnegative, p-integrable functions f such that [formula] for almost every L∈F. If n = kp, then the amount  modp(F) is a conformal invariant.

In this paper, we study the variation of a modulus. We generalize the result obtained by Kalina and Pierzchalski [\cite=kp] for codimension one foliations given by a submersion. We assume the existence of a function f0 which realizes the p-modulus and do not put any requirements on the dimension and codimension of a foliation on a Riemannian manifold (M,g). The methods used here are different than the one used in [\cite=kp] and rely on a integral formula obtained by the author in [\cite=ci]:

The main formula is the following

[formula]

which is valid for all admissible foliations i.e. foliations satisfying certain assumptions (see Theorem [\ref=t_variation]). We show that all foliations given by a submersion are admissible (Theorem [\ref=t_admiss]).

Using the formula [\eqref=eq:variation] we obtain conditions for a foliation to be a critical point of a variation. We show that foliation is a critical point of a variation if and only if the gradient of extremal function f0 is a combination of mean curvature of a foliation and distribution orthogonal to this foliation (Corollary [\ref=c_critpoint]).

Preliminaries

Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold, F a k-dimensional foliation on M. Let μM and μL denote Lebesgue measures on M and L∈F, respectively. Fix the coefficient p > 1 and let Lp(M) be a space of all p-integrable functions on M with respect to μM with the norm [formula]. Denote by admp(F) a subfamily of Lp(M) of all nonnegative functions f such that [formula] for almost every L∈F. The p-modulus  modp(F) of F is defined as follows if [formula] and  modp(F) =   ∞   otherwise [\cite=ci]. Function f0∈admp(F) which realizes the modulus i.e. is called extremal function for p-modulus of F. An extremal function does not exist for any foliation. Namely, we have the following characterization of existence of f0.

There exists an extremal function for p-modulus of a foliation F if and only if for any subfamily L  ⊂  F such that  modp(F) = 0 we have [formula].

Notice that the modulus for any subfamily L  ⊂  F is defined in the same way considering functions defined on M not only on [formula].

The extremal function has the following properties.

Assume there exists an extremal function f0 for p-modulus of F. Then

[formula] for almost every leaf L∈F,

f0 > 0,

for any φ∈Lp(M) we have φ∈L1(L) for almost every leaf L∈F.

Assume there exists an extremal function for a p-modulus of a foliation F. Then, by Proposition [\ref=p_propext], for any φ∈Lp(M) we have φ∈L1(L) for almost every L∈F. Hence, the following function is well defined.

Let f0 be an extremal function for p-modulus of F. Let φ∈Lp(M) be such that esssup|φ| <   ∞   and esssup|| <   ∞  . Then

Consider now a foliation F given by the level sets of a submersion Φ:M  →  N i.e. F  =  {Φ- 1(y)}y∈N. Decompose the tangent bundle TM into vertical and horizontal distributions where [formula] denotes the orthogonal complement with respect to Riemannian metric on M. Then [formula], x∈M, is a linear isomorphism. Let [formula] be an adjoint linear operator. The Jacobian JΦ of Φ is equal

The condition for existence of an extremal function for a foliation given by the level sets of a submersion takes the following form.

Let F be a foliation defined by a submersion Φ:M  →  N such that JΦ < C for some constant C. Let Lx denotes the leaf of F through x∈M and put F∞  =  {x∈M:  μLx(Lx) =   ∞  }. Assume moreover μM(M) <   ∞  . Then, there is an extremal function for p-modulus of F (for any p > 1) if and only if μM(F∞) = 0.

There is an explicit formula for an extremal function in the case of a foliation given by a submersion.

If f0 is an extremal function for p-modulus of a foliation F given by the level sets of a submersion Φ:M  →  N, then

Admissible foliations

Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold, p > 1. Let X be a compactly supported vector field on M, φt a flow of X. Let F be a foliation on M and put Ft  =  φt(F).

We say that X is admissible for p-modulus of F if, for some interval I = ( - ε,ε), we have

there exists an extremal function ft for p-modulus of Ft for all t∈I,

the function [formula] is C1-smooth with respect to variable t∈I,

there is h1∈Lp(M) such that |α(x,t)| < h1(x) for all t∈I,

there is h2∈Lp(M) such that [formula] for all t∈I.

In addition, if every compactly supported vector field is admissible for p-modulus of F, then we say that F is p-admissible.

The main result of this section is the following.

Let F be a foliation on a Riemannian manifold M given by the level sets of a submersion Φ:M  →  N. Assume

C1 < JΦ < C2 and  < C3 for some positive constants C1,C2,C3,

an extremal function for p-modulus of F is smooth (p > 1).

Then F is p-admissible.

Let X be compactly supported vector field on M and let φt be a flow of X. Put Ft  =  φt(F). Then Ft is given by the level sets of the submersion [formula]. Moreover where [formula] is a smooth function depending only on differential [formula] of the map φt.

Let Ltz denotes the leaf of Ft through z∈M i.e. We divide the proof into few steps.

Step 1 - there exist an extremal function ft for p-modulus of Ft. Since C1 < JΦ < C2 and φt is a flow of compactly supported vector field then the Jacobian JΦt is bounded. Since μM(F∞) = 0, then μM((Ft)∞) = 0, hence, by Proposition [\ref=p_extfunsub], there exists an extremal function ft for p-modulus of Ft. By Proposition [\ref=p_formulaextfun] we have

Step 2 - function [formula] is C1-smooth. By [\eqref=eq_funeksft]

[formula]

Functions and are smooth and positive. Since X is compactly supported, for any closed interval I containing [formula], functions are bounded. By Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, function I∋t  ↦  α(x,t) is differentiable. Analogously, we show that this function is twice differentiable, hence is C1-smooth.

Step 3 - [formula] and [formula] for some C > 0. By [\eqref=eq_ftfit] and

[formula]

Step 4 - inf f0 > 0. Follows from the fact that C1 < JΦ < C2 and  < C3 i.e.

By above theorem we get immediately the following corollary.

Let F be a foliation given by the level sets of a submersion Φ:M  →  N, where M is compact. Assume an extremal function for p-modulus of F is smooth. Then F is p-admissible.

Variation of modulus

In this section, we consider the variation of p-modulus under the flow of compactly supported vector field. The formula for a variation implies some results about an extremal function.

Let F be a k-dimensional foliation on a Riemannian manifold (M,g). Denote by divFX the divergence of a vector field X∈Γ(TM) with respect to leaves of F i.e. where [formula] is a local orthonormal basis of TF and [formula] the Levi-Civita connection on M. Let HF and [formula] denote the mean curvatures of F and the distribution [formula] orthogonal to F, respectively. If X is tangent to F then the divergence divMX on M and the divergence on the leaves divFX are related as follows

[formula]

Moreover, if φt is a flow of a vector field X∈Γ(TM) and Ft  =  φt(F), then

[formula]

where [formula] is the Jacobian of φt restricted to leaves of F. In particular,

Let F be a foliation on a Riemannian manifold (M,g). Let X be compactly supported vector field on M, which is admissible for p-modulus of F. Assume there exists smooth extremal function f0 for p-modulus of F. Then, the following formula holds

[formula]

Before we prove above theorem we will need the following technical lemma.

Let [formula] be defined as follows [formula]. Then In particular,

[formula]

Consider two maps [formula] and [formula], Then [formula]. Hence and

Since X is admissible for p-modulus of F, then there are functions h1,h2∈Lp(M) such that conditions (A1) and (A2) hold. By Lemma [\ref=l_technical] and [\eqref=eq_divflow] we have

[formula]

where [formula], t∈I, and divFX < C2. Function h = C1h2 + C1C2h1 is in Lp(M), hence, the existence of extremal function f0 implies that h∈L1(L) for almost every leaf L∈F (Proposition [\ref=p_propext]). By Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, Lemma [\ref=l_technical] and [\eqref=eq_divflow] for any L∈F we have

[formula]

Let Lt denotes the leaf of Ft i.e. Lt  =  φt(L), L∈F. Since, by Proposition [\ref=p_propext], [formula], then Hence, by above, Notice that

[formula]

for some constant C > 0. Since esssup|| <   ∞  , it follows that Hence we may use Theorem [\ref=t_intfor] for [formula]. Moreover, we have and

[formula]

for some constants C',C'' > 0. By Hölder inequality function hp - 11h2 is integrable on M, hence function C'hp - 11h2 + C''hp1 is integrable on M. Thus, by Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem and Lemma [\ref=l_technical]

[formula]

Finally, by Theorem [\ref=t_intfor], we obtain

[formula]

Variation of modulus implies the condition for tangent gradient of an extremal function (compare Corollary 4.4 [\cite=ci])

Let F be a foliation on a Riemannian manifold (M,g). Assume all compactly supported vector fields X tangent to F are admissible for p-modulus of F. Then

Let X∈Γ(TF) be compactly supported. Then the flow φt of X maps F to F, hence Ft  =  F for all t. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=t_variation] and formula [\ref=eq_divmf], we have

[formula]

Therefore, for compactly supported vector field X∈Γ(TF) Since X∈Γ(TF) is arbitrary, it follows that

Let F be a p-admissible foliation on a Riemannian manifold M. We say that F is a critical point of a functional

[formula]

if for any compactly supported vector field X we have [formula], where Ft  =  φt(F) and φt is a flow of X.

The following result gives the characterization of critical points.

Let F be a p-admissible foliation on a Riemannian manifold M. Then, F is a critical point of [\eqref=eq_functional] if and only if

[formula]

where f0 is an extremal function for p-modulus of F and p,q are conjugate coefficients i.e. [formula].

We begin proof by stating general facts. By Corollary [\ref=c_nablabotextfun]

[formula]

Moreover, since divFX = g(X,HF) for [formula], then

[formula]

for all compactly supported vector fields [formula].

Assume F is a critical point of a functional [\eqref=eq_functional]. Then by [\eqref=eq_varxbot] we get [formula], hence This, together with [\eqref=eq_nablatopfp], implies [\eqref=eq_ctiticaliff].

Assume now [\eqref=eq_ctiticaliff] holds. Right-hand side of [\eqref=eq_variation] is linear with respect to X. Moreover, for X tangent to F we have (compare proof of Corollary [\ref=c_nablabotextfun]) [formula]. Hence, by [\eqref=eq_varxbot], it suffices to show that for all compactly supported vector fields [formula]. This follows by assumption [\eqref=eq_ctiticaliff], which implies [formula].

Now, we consider the case of two orthogonal foliations i.e. we assume that for a given foliation F on a Riemannian manifold (M,g) the distribution [formula] is integrable. Let p,q > 1, be conjugate coefficients i.e. [formula].

Assume F is p-admissible and G is q-admissible. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

F and G are a critical points of the functionals respectively,

the pair (F,G) is a critical point of a functional

the extremal functions f0 of p-modulus of F and g0 of q-modulus of G are related as follows

[formula]

(1) ⇒   (2) Follows from the equality

[formula]

(2) ⇒   (1) By existence of extremal functions of p-modulus of F and q-modulus of G, it follow by Proposition [\ref=p_extfun] that p-modulus of F and q-modulus of G are positive. If [formula], then [formula], hence, by [\eqref=eq_modpq], If X∈Γ(TF), then  modp(Ft)t = 0 = 0. Since the variation of modulus is linear with respect to X, it follows that [formula] for any compactly supported vector field X. Analogously [formula] for any compactly supported vector field X. (1) ⇔   (3) By Corollary [\ref=c_critpoint] condition (1) is equivalent to the following

[formula]

Assume (1) holds. Then by [\eqref=eq_fgnabla], fp0 = Cgq0 for some constant C > 0. Hence f0 and g0 are Hölder dependent. Thus

[formula]

Therefore so [\eqref=eq_fgdependent] holds.

Assume now f0 and g0 are Hölder dependent and [\eqref=eq_fgdependent] holds. Thus

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=c_nablabotextfun] we have where [formula] and [formula] denote tangent to F and to G part of the gradient, respectively. By above equalities and by [\eqref=eq_fgdep2] hence, by Corollary [\ref=c_critpoint], F is a critical point of a functional [\eqref=eq_functional]. Analogously, G is a critical point of a functional [\eqref=eq_functional] with a coefficient q. Therefore (1) holds.
