Introduction

All vector spaces in this article are over the field [formula], being either the field [formula] of complex numbers or the field [formula] of real numbers. As usual, [formula] is the set of positive integers and [formula]. Throughout the article, all topological spaces are assumed to be Hausdorff. For a topological vector space X, L(X) is the algebra of continuous linear operators on X, X' is the space of continuous linear functionals on X and GL(X) is the group of T∈L(X) such that T is invertible and T- 1∈L(X). By saying 'countable', we always mean 'infinite countable'. Recall that a Fréchet space is a complete metrizable locally convex space. Recall also that the topology τ of a topological vector space X is called weak if τ is exactly the weakest topology making each f∈Y continuous for some linear space Y of linear functionals on X separating points of X. It is well-known and easy to see that a topology of a metrizable infinite dimensional topological vector space X is weak if and only if X is isomorphic to a dense linear subspace of [formula].

Recall that x∈X is called a hypercyclic vector for T∈L(X) if the orbit

[formula]

is dense in X and T is called hypercyclic if it has a hypercyclic vector. It is easy to see that an orbit of a hypercyclic vector is always dense countable and linearly independent. For a topological vector space X, we denote the set of all countable dense linearly independent subsets of X by the symbol Σ(X). Thus For more information on hypercyclicity see books [\cite=bama-book] [\cite=book2] and references therein. For the sake of brevity, we shall say that a subset A of a topological vector space X is an orbit if there are T∈L(X) and x∈X such that A = O(T,x).

The starting point for this article is the theorem by Grivaux [\cite=gri2] stating that every countable dense linearly independent subset of a separable infinite dimensional Banach space is an orbit of a hypercyclic operator. This result easily follows from another theorem in [\cite=gri2]:

The above theorem leads to the following definition.

A locally convex topological vector space X is called a G-space if Σ(X) is non-empty and GL(X) acts transitively on Σ(X).

Thus Theorem G states that every separable infinite dimensional Banach space is a G-space. For the convenience of the reader we reproduce the derivation of the main result in [\cite=gri2] from Theorem G.

Let X be a G-space possessing a hypercyclic operator T0∈L(X). Then every A∈Σ(X) is an orbit.

Let x0 be a hypercyclic vector for T0∈L(X) and A∈Σ(X). Since X is a G-space and both A and O(T0,x) belong to Σ(X), there is J∈GL(X) such that J- 1(A) = O(T0,x0). Let T = JT0J- 1 and x = Jx0. Then

[formula]

Thus A is an orbit.

Our main goal is to try and extend Theorem G to Fréchet spaces. Since every separable infinite dimensional Fréchet space supports a hypercyclic operator [\cite=bope], Lemma [\ref=nle] implies that for every Fréchet space X, which is also a G-space, every A∈Σ(X) is an orbit of a hypercyclic operator. Note that Bonet, Frerick, Peris and Wengenroth [\cite=fre] constructed A∈Σ(ω), which is not an orbit of a hypercyclic operator and therefore ω is not a G-space. Our main result is the following theorem.

Let X be a separable infinite dimensional Fréchet space. Then the following statements are equivalent:

X possesses a continuous norm;

X is a G-space;

every A∈Σ(X) is an orbit.

Our methods can be applied to obtain the following result, which answers a question raised in [\cite=shh] and extends the above mentioned result of Grivaux stating that every countably dimensional normed space possesses a hypercyclic operator.

Every countably dimensional metrizable locally convex space possesses a hypercyclic operator.

The following result is our main instrument. In order to formulate it we need to recall a few definitions. A subset D of a locally convex space X is called a disk if D is bounded, convex and balanced (=is stable under multiplication by [formula] with [formula]). The symbol XD stands for the space [formula] endowed with the norm [formula] being the Minkowski functional of the set D. Boundedness of D implies that the topology of XD is stronger than the one inherited from X. A disk D in X is called a Banach disk if the normed space XD is complete. It is well-known that a sequentially complete disk is a Banach disk, see, for instance, [\cite=bonet]. In particular, every compact or sequentially compact disk is a Banach disk.

We say that a seminorm p on a vector space X is non-trivial if [formula] is infinite dimensional, where

[formula]

Note that the topology of a locally convex space is non-weak if and only if there is a non-trivial continuous seminorm on X.

If p is a seminorm on a vector space X, we say that A  ⊂  X is p-independent if [formula] for any [formula], any pairwise different [formula] and any non-zero [formula]. In other words, vectors [formula] for x∈A are linearly independent in [formula].

Let X be a locally convex space, p be a continuous seminorm on X, D be a Banach disk in X and A,B be countable subsets of X such that both A and B are p-independent and both A and B are dense subsets of the Banach space XD. Then there exists J∈GL(X) such that J(A) = B and Jx = x for every [formula].

We prove Theorem [\ref=male] in Section [\ref=s2]. In Section [\ref=s3] we show that GL(ω) acts transitively on the set of dense countably dimensional subspaces of ω. Section [\ref=s4] is devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=mama]. We prove Theorem [\ref=mamama] in Section [\ref=s5] and discuss open problems in Section [\ref=s6].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=male]

For a continuous seminorm p on a locally convex space X, we denote

[formula]

Note that p*(f) (if finite) is the smallest non-negative number c such that [formula] for every x∈X.

Let X be a locally convex space, p be a continuous seminorm on X, D be a Banach disk in X and [formula] and [formula] be sequences in XD and X' respectively such that [formula]. Then the formula [formula] defines a continuous linear operator on X. Furthermore, if p is bounded by 1 on D and c < 1, then the operator I + T is invertible.

Clearly [formula]. It follows that the series defining Tx converges in XD and

[formula]

Thus T is a well-defined continuous linear map from X to XD. Since the topology of XD is stronger than the one inherited from X, T∈L(X).

Assume now that p is bounded by 1 on D and c < 1. Then from the inequality [formula] and the above display it follows that [formula] for every x∈X and [formula]. Since c < 1, the formula [formula] defines a linear map from X to XD satisfying [formula] for x∈X. Thus S is continuous as a map from X to XD and therefore S∈L(X). It is a routine exercise to check that (I + S)(I + T) = (I + T)(I + S) = I. That is, I + T is invertible.

Let ε > 0, X be a locally convex space, D be a Banach disk in X, Y be a closed linear subspace of X, [formula] be a dense subset of Y such that M is pD-dense in [formula], p be a continuous seminorm on X, L be a finite dimensional subspace of X and T∈L(X) be a finite rank operator such that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then

for every [formula] such that [formula], there are f∈X' and [formula] such that p*(f) = 1, [formula], pD(v) < ε, (I + R)u∈M and [formula], where Rx = Tx + f(x)v;

for every [formula] such that [formula], there are f∈X', a∈M and [formula] such that p*(f) = 1, [formula], pD(v) < ε, (I + R)a = u and [formula], where Rx = Tx + f(x)v.

Let [formula] be such that [formula]. The Hahn-Banach theorem provides f∈X' such that p*(f) = 1, f(u)  ≠  0 and [formula]. First, observe that there is δ > 0 such that the only solution of the equation Tx + x + f(x)v = 0 is x = 0 whenever v∈XD and pD(v) < δ. Indeed, assume the contrary. Then there exist sequences [formula] and [formula] in XD such that pD(xn) = 1 for every [formula], pD(vn)  →  0 and Txn + xn + f(xn)vn = 0 for each [formula]. Since [formula] is a bounded sequence in the finite dimensional subspace T(X) of XD, passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we can without loss of generality assume that xn converges to x∈T(X)  ⊂  XD with respect to pD. That is, pD(x) = 1 and pD(xn - x)  →  0. Passing to the pD-limit in Txn + xn + f(xn)vn = 0, we obtain Tx + x = 0, which contradicts the equality [formula]. Thus there is δ > 0 such that the only solution of the equation Tx + x = f(x)v is x = 0 whenever v∈XD and pD(v) < δ. Since M is pD-dense in [formula] and [formula], there is r∈M such that pD(r - u - Tu) <  min {δ|f(u)|,ε|f(u)|}. Define [formula] and Rx = Tx + f(x)v. Clearly, pD(v) < ε. Since pD(v) < δ, [formula]. A direct computation gives [formula]. Thus f and v satisfy all desired conditions.

Now assume that [formula] is such that [formula]. The fact that T has finite rank and [formula] implies that I + T is invertible. Furthermore, the inclusion [formula] and the finiteness of the rank of T imply that (I + T)- 1(Y)  ⊆  Y and (I + T)- 1(XD)  ⊆  XD. Thus there is a unique [formula] such that (I + T)w = u. Since [formula] and [formula], we have [formula]. The Hahn-Banach theorem provided f∈X' such that p*(f) = 1, f(w)  ≠  0 and [formula]. Exactly as in the first part of the proof, we observe that there is δ > 0 such that the only solution of the equation Tx + x + f(x)v = 0 is x = 0 whenever v∈XD and pD(v) < δ. Since f(w)  ≠  0 and M is pD-dense in [formula], we can find a∈M (close enough to w with respect to pD) such that pD(v) < δ and pD(v) < δ, where [formula]. Now set Rx = Tx + f(x)v. Since pD(v) < δ, [formula]. A direct computation gives [formula]. Thus f, a and v satisfy all desired conditions.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=male]. Without loss of generality, we may assume that p is bounded by 1 on D. Equivalently, [formula] for every x∈XD.

Fix arbitrary bijections [formula] and [formula] and a sequence [formula] of positive numbers such that [formula]. We shall construct inductively sequences [formula] and [formula] of positive integers, [formula] in XD, [formula] in Xp' and [formula] in L(X) such that T0 = 0 and for every [formula],

[formula]

T0 = 0 serves as the basis of induction. Let [formula] and assume that mj,nj,vj,fj,Tj for [formula] satisfying ([\ref=t1]-[\ref=t5]) are already constructed. By ([\ref=t4]) with k < q,

[formula]

According to ([\ref=t3]) with k = q - 1, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=nuc1], I + Tq - 1 is invertible. Since each p*(fj) is finite, Tq - 1 vanishes on [formula]. In particular, [formula]. Since each vj belongs to XD, Tq - 1(X)  ⊆  XD. Clearly Tq - 1 has finite rank. Set Y = X, [formula] and [formula]. Since A is p-independent [formula], where u = a(n2q - 1) and [formula]. Applying the first part of Lemma [\ref=step1] with the just defined u, Y and L and with T = Tq - 1, ε  =  ε2q - 1 and [formula], we find f2q - 1∈X' and v2q - 1∈XD such that p*(f2q - 1) = 1, [formula], pD(v2q - 1) < ε2q - 1 and (I + S)u∈M, where Sx = Tq - 1x + f2q - 1(x)v2q - 1. The inclusion (I + S)u∈M means that (I + S)u = b(m2q - 1) for some [formula]. Since u = a(n2q - 1) and [formula], ([\ref=t5]) with k = q - 1 implies that

[formula]

By definition of S, [formula] with [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=nuc1], I + S is invertible. Since each p*(fj) is finite and each vj belongs to XD, S vanishes on [formula] and S(X)  ⊆  XD. Clearly S has finite rank. Since B is p-independent the above display ensures that [formula], where u = b(m2q) and [formula]. Applying the second part of Lemma [\ref=step1] with Y = X and the just defined u and L and with T = S, ε  =  ε2q and [formula], we find f2q∈Xp', v2q∈XD and w∈M such that p*(f2q) = 1, [formula], pD(v2q) < ε2q and (I + Tq)w = u, where Tqx = Sx + f2n(x)v2n. The inclusion w∈M means that w = a(n2q) for some [formula]. Since u = b(m2q) and [formula], the above display yields

[formula]

Since n2q - 1  ≠  n2q, m2q - 1  ≠  m2q, [formula] and [formula], ([\ref=t1]) with k = q follow from ([\ref=t1]) with k = q - 1. By construction, ([\ref=t3]), ([\ref=t4]) and ([\ref=t5]) with k = q are satisfied. Since [formula] and [formula], ([\ref=t2]) for k = q follows from ([\ref=t2]) with k = q - 1. Thus ([\ref=t1]-[\ref=t5]) are all satisfied for k = q. This concludes the inductive construction of mj,nj,vj,fj,Tj for [formula].

By ([\ref=t1]) and ([\ref=t2]), the map nj  ↦  mj is a bijection from [formula] to itself. By ([\ref=t3]) and ([\ref=t4]), the sequence {Tn} converges pointwise to the operator T∈L(X) given by the formula [formula]. Since [formula], ([\ref=t3]) and Lemma [\ref=nuc1] imply that J = I + T is invertible. Since p*(fj) <   ∞   for every j, T vanishes on [formula] and therefore Jx = x for [formula]. Passing to the limit in ([\ref=t5]), we obtain that Ja(nj) = b(mj) for every [formula]. Since nj  ↦  mj is a bijection from [formula] to itself, we get J(A) = B. Thus J satisfies all required conditions. The proof of Theorem [\ref=male] is now complete.

Countably dimensional subspaces of ω

The main result of this section is the following theorem.

GL(ω) acts transitively on the set of dense countably dimensional linear subspaces of ω.

In order to prove the above result we need few technical lemmas. As usual, we identify ω with [formula]. For [formula], the symbol δn stands for the nth coordinate functional on ω. That is, δn∈ω' is defined by δn(x) = xn. By φ we denote the linear subspace of ω consisting of sequences with finite support. That is, x∈φ precisely when there is [formula] such that xm = 0 for all [formula].

Let [formula] be linearly independent functionals on a vector space E, A  ⊆  E be such that [formula] and [formula] be such that the matrix [formula] is invertible. Then there exists xn + 1∈A such that [formula] is invertible.

Since the matrix [formula] is invertible, the vector [formula] is a linear combination of the rows of B. That is, there exist [formula] such that g(xj) = 0 for [formula], where [formula]. Since fj are linearly independent, g  ≠  0. Since [formula], we can find xn + 1∈A such that g(xn + 1)  ≠  0. Consider the (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) matrix [formula] defined by γj,k = fj(xk) for [formula], [formula] and γn + 1,k = g(xk) for [formula]. Since [formula] is invertible, γn + 1,k = g(xk) = 0 for [formula] and γn + 1,n + 1 = g(xn + 1)  ≠  0, C is invertible. Indeed, [formula]. It remains to notice that [formula] is obtained from C by adding a linear combination of the first n rows to the last row. Hence [formula] and B+ is invertible as required.

Applying Lemma [\ref=ome1] and treating the elements of a vector space E as linear functionals on a space of linear functionals on E, we immediately get the following result.

Let [formula] be linearly independent elements of a vector space E, A be a collection of linear functionals on E separating the points of E and [formula] be linear functionals on E such that the matrix [formula] is invertible. Then there exists fn + 1∈A such that [formula] is invertible.

Let [formula] be a Hamel basis in a vector space E and [formula] be a linearly independent sequence of linear functionals on E separating the points of E. Then there exist bijections [formula] and [formula] such that for every [formula], the matrix [formula] is invertible.

Furthermore, there exist complex numbers cj,k for [formula] such that cj,j  ≠  0 and fα(j)(vj) = 1 for [formula] and fα(j)(vk) = 0 for [formula] and j < k, where [formula].

We shall construct inductively two sequences [formula] and [formula] of natural numbers such that

[formula]

Basis of induction.  Take α1 = 1. Since f1  ≠  0 and the vectors un span E, there is [formula] such that fα1(uβ1)  ≠  0. Now we take [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=ome2], there is [formula] such that [formula] is invertible. Clearly, [formula]. Thus α1,α2,β1,β2 satisfy ([\ref=inin1]) and ([\ref=inin2]).

The induction step.  Assume that [formula] and [formula] satisfying ([\ref=inin1]) with [formula] and ([\ref=inin2]) with [formula] are already constructed. The latter implies that βj are pairwise distinct and αj are pairwise distinct. First, take [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=ome1], there is [formula] such that [formula] is invertible. Automatically, [formula]. Next, we take [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=ome2], there is [formula] such that [formula] is invertible. Since [formula], [formula] and [formula], we have [formula]. Thus [formula] satisfy ([\ref=inin1]) with [formula] and ([\ref=inin2]) with [formula].

This concludes the inductive construction of [formula] and [formula] satisfying ([\ref=inin1]) and ([\ref=inin2]). According to ([\ref=inin2]), αj are pairwise distinct and βj are pairwise distinct. By ([\ref=inin1]), [formula]. Hence the maps [formula] defined by α(j) = αj and β(j) = βj are bijections. By ([\ref=inin2]), the matrix [formula] is invertible for every [formula].

Now let [formula]. Since [formula] is invertible, we can find [formula] such that the linear combination of the columns of Am with the coefficients [formula] is the vector [formula]. Note that cm,m can not be 0. Indeed, otherwise a non-trivial linear combination of the columns of the invertible matrix Am - 1 is 0. The fact that the linear combination of the columns of Am with the coefficients [formula] is [formula] can be rewritten as fα(m)(vm) = 1 and fα(j)(vm) = 0 for j < m, where [formula]. Doing this for every [formula], we obtain the numbers {cj,m} and the vectors vm satisfying all desired conditions.

Let E be a dense countably dimensional linear subspace of ω. Then there is a Hamel basis [formula] in E and a bijection [formula] such that δα(n)(vn) = 1 and δα(k)(vn) = 0 whenever [formula] and k < n.

Take an arbitrary Hamel basis [formula] in E. Applying Lemma [\ref=ome3] with fn  =  δn, we find bijections [formula] and complex numbers cj,k for [formula] such that cj,j  ≠  0 and fα(j)(vj) = 1 for [formula] and fα(j)(vk) = 0 for [formula] and j < k, where [formula].

It remains to notice that since {un} is a Hamel basis in E, {vn} is also a Hamel basis in E. Indeed, it is straightforward to verify that [formula] for every [formula]. Thus the Hamel basis {un} and the bijection α satisfy all desired conditions.

Let E be a dense countably dimensional subspace of ω. By Lemma [\ref=wow], there is a Hamel basis [formula] in E and a bijection [formula] such that δα(n)(vn) = 1 and δα(k)(vn) = 0 whenever [formula] and k < n. Consider T:ω  →  ω defined by the formula

[formula]

If [formula] is the standard basis of ω, then it is easy to see that the matrix of T with respect to the 'shuffled' basis [formula] is lower-triangular with all entries 1 on the main diagonal. It follows that T is a well-defined invertible continuous linear operator on ω. It remains to observe that T(φ) = E. Hence each dense countably dimensional subspace of ω is the image of φ under an isomorphism of ω onto itself. Hence isomorphisms of ω act transitively on the set of dense countably dimensional linear subspaces of ω.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mama]

Let [formula] be a sequence in a sequentially complete locally convex space X such that xn  →  0. Then the set

[formula]

is a Banach disk. Moreover, [formula] is a dense linear subspace of the Banach space XK.

Let [formula] be endowed with the coordinatewise convergence topology. Then Q is metrizable and compact as a closed subspace of the compact metrizable space [formula], where [formula]. Obviously, the map Φ:Q  →  K, [formula] is onto. Moreover, Φ is continuous. Indeed, let p be a continuous seminorm on X, a∈Q and ε > 0. Since xn  →  0, there is [formula] such that [formula] for n > m. Set [formula] and [formula]. Then W is a neighborhood of a in Q and for each b∈W, we have

[formula]

Since p(xn) < ε for n > m, |an - bn| < δ for [formula] and [formula], [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Using the definition of δ, we see that [formula]. Since a, p and ε are arbitrary, Φ is continuous. Thus K is compact and metrizable as a continuous image of a compact metrizable space. Obviously, K is convex and balanced. Hence K is a Banach disk (any compact disk is a Banach disk). It remains to show that E is dense in XK. Take u∈XK. Then there is [formula] such that [formula]. Clearly, [formula]. Then [formula] as n  →    ∞  . Hence E is dense in XK.

Let X be a Fréchet space and A and B be dense countable subsets of X. Then there exists a Banach disk D in X such that both A and B are dense subsets of the Banach space (XD,pD).

Let C be the set of all linear combinations of the elements of [formula] with rational coefficients. Obviously, C is countable. Pick a map [formula] such that f- 1(x) is an infinite subset of [formula] for every x∈C. Since A and B are dense in X, we can find maps [formula] and [formula] such that 4m(f(m) - α(m))  →  0 and 4m(f(m) - β(m))  →  0. Since A and B are countable, we can write [formula] and [formula]. Using metrizability of X, we can find a sequence [formula] of positive numbers such that γmxm  →  0 and γmym  →  0. Enumerating the countable set

[formula]

as one (convergent to 0) sequence and applying Lemma [\ref=l11] to this sequence, we find that there is a Banach disk D in X such that XD contains A and B, the linear span of [formula] is pD-dense in XD and f(m) - α(m)  →  0 and f(m) - β(m)  →  0 in XD. The pD-density of the linear span of [formula] in XD implies the pD-density of C in XD. Taking into account that f- 1(x) is infinite for every x∈C and that α takes values in A, the pD-density of C in XD and the relation [formula] implies that A is pD-dense in XD. Similarly, B is pD-dense in XD. Thus D satisfies all required conditions.

Let X be a separable Fréchet space and p be a non-trivial continuous seminorm on X. Then for every dense countable set A  ⊂  X, there is B  ⊆  A such that B is p-independent and dense in X.

Let [formula] be a countable basis of the topology of X. We shall construct (inductively) a sequence [formula] of elements of A such that for every [formula],

[formula]

Note that in every topological vector space, the linear span of a dense subset of a non-empty open set is a dense linear subspace. It follows that for each [formula],

[formula]

Hence [formula]. Thus we can pick [formula], which will serve as the basis of induction. Assume now that [formula] and [formula] satisfying ([\ref=in1]) for [formula] are already constructed. Let L be the linear span of [formula]. Since the sum of a closed subspace of a topological vector space and a finite dimensional subspace is always closed and the codimension of [formula] in X is infinite, [formula] is a proper closed linear subspace of X. By ([\ref=gn]), we can pick [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] satisfy ([\ref=in1]) for [formula], which concludes the inductive construction of [formula] satisfying ([\ref=in1]) for every [formula]. It remains to observe that [formula], B is dense in X since it meets each Un and B is p-independent.

Proof of the implications ([\ref=mama].1)[formula]([\ref=mama].2) and ([\ref=mama].2)[formula]([\ref=mama].3)

Assume that a separable infinite dimensional Fréchet space X possesses a continuous norm p and that A,B∈Σ(X). By Lemma [\ref=l22], there is a Banach disk D in X such that both A and B are dense subsets of the Banach space XD. By Theorem [\ref=male], there exists J∈GL(X) such that J(A) = B. Thus GL(X) acts transitively on Σ(X). Since X is separable and metrizable, Σ(X) is non-empty. Hence X is a G-space, which proves the implication ([\ref=mama].1)[formula]([\ref=mama].2). Since every separable infinite dimensional Fréchet space supports a hypercyclic operator [\cite=bope], Lemma [\ref=nle] provides the implication [formula].

Proof of the implication ([\ref=mama].3)[formula]([\ref=mama].1)

Let X be a separable Fréchet space possessing no continuous norm. The implication ([\ref=mama].3)[formula]([\ref=mama].1) will be verified if we show that there exists A∈Σ(X), which is not an orbit of a continuous linear operator. If X is isomorphic to ω, the job is already done by Bonet, Frerick, Peris and Wengenroth [\cite=fre]. It remains to consider the case of X non-isomorphic to ω. Since X is a Fréchet space possessing no continuous norm and non-isomorphic to ω, the topology of X can be defined by an increasing sequence [formula] of seminorms such that p1 is non-trivial and [formula] for each [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lile], there is a dense in X countable p1-independent set B. Since [formula] for each [formula], for each [formula], we can pick [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. Obviously A is a countable subset of X. Since B is dense in X and B  ⊆  A, A is dense in X. Finally, the p1-independence of B and the inclusions [formula] imply that A is linearly independent. Thus A∈Σ(X). It suffices to verify that A is not an orbit. Assume the contrary. Then there are T∈L(X) and x∈X such that A = O(T,x). Let [formula]. Since B does not meet [formula], p1(Tn + 1x) > 0 for every n∈M. Thus we can consider the (finite or countable) series [formula]. Since Tnx for n∈M are pairwise distinct elements of C and every pk vanishes on all but finitely many elements of C, the series S converges absolutely in X. Since T:X  →  X is a continuous linear operator and every continuous linear operator on a locally convex space maps an absolutely convergent series to an absolutely convergent series, the series [formula] is also absolutely convergent. Hence the application of p1 to the terms of T(S) gives a convergent series of non-negative numbers. But the latter series is [formula]. Its convergence is equivalent to the finiteness of M. Thus M is finite. Let m =  max (M) if [formula] and m = 0 if [formula]. Since C  ⊂  O(T,x) and C is infinite, there is [formula] such that k > m and Tkx∈C. Since [formula], from the definition of M it follows that Tjx∈C for every [formula]. Hence Tjx∈C for all but finitely many j. It follows that [formula] is finite, which is a contradiction. This contradiction shows that A is not an orbit and completes the proof of the implication ([\ref=mama].3)[formula]([\ref=mama].1) and that of Theorem [\ref=mama].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mamama]

Let p be a continuous seminorm on a locally convex space X and E be a countably dimensional subspace of X such that [formula]. Then there exist a Hamel basis [formula] in E and a sequence [formula] in X'p such that fn(um) = δn,m for every [formula].

Begin with an arbitrary Hamel basis [formula] in E. The proof is a variation of the Gramm-Schmidt procedure. Clearly, it suffices to construct (inductively) two sequences [formula] in E and [formula] in X'p such that for every [formula],

[formula]

Indeed, ([\ref=III1]) ensures that [formula] is also a Hamel basis in E.

First, we set u1 = y1 and note that p(u1)  ≠  0. Then we use the Hahn-Banach theorem to find f1∈X'p such that f1(u1) = 1. This gives us the basis of induction. Assume now that [formula] and un,fn satisfying ([\ref=III1]) and ([\ref=III2]) for n < m are already constructed. Condition ([\ref=III2]) for n < m allows us to pick [formula] such that fj(un) = 0 for every j < n. Since yn are linearly independent, [formula]. Since [formula], p(um)  ≠  0. Since [formula] are linearly independent elements of E and p(um)  ≠  0, the Hahn-Banach theorem allows us to choose fm∈X'p such that fm(um) = 1 and fm(uj) = 0 for j < m. Clearly, un and fn for [formula] satisfy ([\ref=III1]) and ([\ref=III2]) for [formula]. This completes the inductive procedure of constructing the sequences [formula] in E and [formula] in X'p satisfying ([\ref=III1]) and ([\ref=III2]) for every [formula].

The following lemma features as [\cite=bama-book].

Let X be a separable Fréchet space and T∈L(X) be such that the linear span of the union of [formula] for [formula] is dense in X. Then I + T is hypercyclic.

Let p be a non-trivial continuous seminorm on a separable locally convex space X for which there exists a Banach disk D in X such that XD is a dense subspace of X and the Banach space (XD,pD) is separable. Then there exists T∈L(X) such that T is hypercyclic and Tx = x for every [formula].

Since XD is dense in X and the Banach space topology on XD is stronger than the one inherited from X, the restriction of p to XD is a non-trivial continuous seminorm on the Banach space XD. By Lemma [\ref=l22], there is a dense countable subspace A of the Banach space XD such that A is p-independent. Let [formula]. Then E is a dense in (XD,pD) and therefore in X countably dimensional subspace of XD. Since A is p-independent, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=bububu], there is a Hamel basis [formula] in E and a sequence [formula] in X'p such that fn(um) = δn,m for every [formula].

Consider the linear map S:X  →  XD defined by the formula:

[formula]

The series in the above display converges absolutely in XD since [formula]. Furthermore [formula] for every x∈X. Hence S is a well-defined continuous linear map from X to XD. In particular, S∈L(X) and the restriction SD of S to XD is a continuous linear operator on the Banach space XD. Moreover, analyzing the action of S on uk, it is easy to see that S(E) = SD(E) = E and therefore E  ⊆  SnD(XD) for every [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] for every [formula]. Hence [formula]. Since E is dense in XD, Lemma [\ref=bml] implies that TD = I + SD is a hypercyclic operator on the Banach space XD. Since the topology of XD is stronger than the one inherited from X and XD is dense in X, every hypercyclic vector for TD is also hypercyclic for T = I + S∈L(X). Thus T = I + S is hypercyclic. Next, p-boundedness of each fk implies that each fk vanishes on [formula]. Hence [formula] and therefore Tx = x for every [formula].

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=mamama]. Let E be a countably dimensional metrizable locally convex space. Denote the completion of E by the symbol X. That is, X is a separable infinite dimensional Fréchet space and E is a dense countably dimensional subspace of E.

Case 1:  X is non-isomorphic to ω. In this case the topology of X is non-weak and therefore X supports a non-trivial continuous seminorm p. By Lemma [\ref=lile], there is a countable dense in X p-independent set B such that B  ⊆  E. A standard application of Zorn's lemma provides a maximal by inclusion p-independent subset A of E containing B. Since B  ⊆  A, A is dense in X. Since E is countably dimensional, A is countable (p-independence implies linear independence). By Lemma [\ref=l22], every separable infinite dimensional Fréchet space contains a Banach disk K such that XK is a separable Banach space and XK is dense in X. Now by Lemma [\ref=hype] there is a hypercyclic T∈L(X) such that Tx = x for every [formula]. Let u be a hypercyclic vector for T. First, we shall verify that O(T,u) is p-independent. Assume the contrary. Then there exists a non-zero polynomial r such that [formula]. Then for every [formula], we can write tn = r(t)q(t) + v(t), where q and v are polynomials and deg v <  deg r = d. Hence Tnu = q(T)r(T)u + v(T)u. Since [formula] and [formula] is invariant for T, [formula]. Hence [formula], where [formula]. Since L is finite dimensional and [formula] is a closed subspace of X of infinite codimension, [formula] is a proper closed subspace of X. We have obtained a contradiction with the density of O(T,u). Thus the countable dense in X set O(T,u) is p-independent. Recall that A is also countable, dense in X and p-independent. By Lemma [\ref=l22], there is a Banach disk D in X such that both A and O(T,u) are dense subsets of the Banach space (XD,pD). By Theorem [\ref=male], there exists J∈GL(X) such that J(O(T,u)) = A and Jx = x for every [formula]. Let S = JTJ- 1. Exactly as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=nle], one easily sees that Ju is a hypercyclic vector for S and that O(S,Ju) = A. In particular, Ju∈A  ⊂  E. It remains to verify that S(E)  ⊆  E. Indeed, in this case the restriction of S to E provides a continuous linear operator on E with Ju being its hypercyclic vector.

Let x∈E. It suffices to show that Sx∈E. The maximality of A implies that we can write x = y + z, where [formula] and [formula]. Since A  ⊂  E, y∈E and therefore z = x - y∈E. Since A = O(S,Ju), S(A)  ⊆  A. Hence [formula]. It follows that Sy∈E. Since Tv = Jv = v for [formula], we have Sv = v for [formula] and therefore Sz = z. Thus Sx = Sy + Sz = Sy + z∈E, as required. This completes the proof for Case 1.

Case 2:  X is isomorphic to ω. It is well-known (see, for instance, [\cite=bope]) that ω supports a hypercyclic operator. Actually, it is easy to see that the shift [formula], (Sx)n = xn + 1 is hypercyclic. Thus, we can take S∈L(X) and x∈X such that x is a hypercyclic vector for S and let [formula]. Then F is another dense countably dimensional subspace of X. Obviously F supports a hypercyclic operator (the restriction of S to F). By Theorem [\ref=omeg], E and F are isomorphic. Hence E supports a hypercyclic operator. The proof of Theorem [\ref=mamama] is now complete.

Open problems and remarks

Note that the locally convex direct sum φ of countably many copies of the one-dimensional space [formula] is a complete countably dimensional locally convex space. A number of authors, see, for instance, [\cite=bope], have observed that φ supports no hypercyclic operators.

Characterize countably dimensional locally convex spaces supporting a hypercyclic operator.

The following is an interesting special case of the above problem.

Are there any complete countably dimensional locally convex spaces supporting a hypercyclic operator?

The following question also seems to be interesting.

Characterize complete G-spaces. Characterize complete G-spaces supporting a hypercyclic operator.

Note that although ω is not a G-space, Theorem [\ref=omeg] shows that GL(ω) acts transitively on the set of dense countably dimensional subspaces of ω.
