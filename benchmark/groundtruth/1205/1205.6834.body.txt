A chemically-driven finite-wavelength instability in ion-irradiated compound semiconductors

Introduction

Among the many nanoscale patterns that have been observed on ion-irradiated surfaces [\cite=chan-chason-JAP-2007] [\cite=frost-etal-APA-2008], the discovery of hexagonal arrays of high-aspect ratio dots on Ar-irradiated GaSb [\cite=facsko-etal-SCIENCE-1999] has sparked a flurry of experimental and theoretical study into spontaneous pattern formation as a potential route to "bottom-up" fabrication of nanoscale devices. The mathematical study of such patterns is a mature field known as bifurcation theory, and the ingredients necessary to produce long-range hexagonal order are well known [\cite=cross-hohenberg-RoMP-1993] [\cite=cross-greenside-2009-book]. First, one needs isotropic physics, which is readily achieved by irradiating the sample at normal incidence, or by rotating it during off-normal bombardment. Second, one needs a destabilizing mechanism that produces a finite wavelength bifurcation - a transition in the linearized equations from stability to instability that occurs first for perturbations of a finite wavelength. Unfortunately, none of the early models of ion irradiation predicted such a finite-wavelength bifurcation [\cite=davidovitch-etal-PRB-2007] [\cite=madi-etal-2008-PRL], suggesting a need for the incorporation of additional physical effects.

Two candidates that initially seemed promising were a "damping" term proposed to stand for long-range atomic redeposition [\cite=facsko-etal-PRB-2004] and biaxial compressive stress injected by the ion beam (see [\cite=davidovitch-etal-PRB-2007] [\cite=madi-etal-2008-PRL] for a comprehensive discussion). However, recently both mechanisms have been ruled out as sources of instability [\cite=bradley-PRB-2011a] [\cite=norris-PRB-2012-viscoelastic-normal]. In parallel with these theoretical struggles, persistent difficulty obtaining consistent results between labs has led to a re-examination of the experimental results. It was found that dots, originally also observed on irradiated pure silicon [\cite=gago-etal-APL-2006] [\cite=ziberi-etal-APL-2008], disappeared from that system when impurities and geometric artifacts were carefully removed [\cite=madi-etal-2008-PRL] [\cite=madi-etal-JPCM-2009] [\cite=madi-aziz-ASS-2012], and conversely, that the systematic addition of impurities to a clean system causes dots to appear [\cite=ozaydin-etal-APL-2005] [\cite=ozaydin-etal-JVSTB-2008] [\cite=ozaydin-ludwig-JPCM-2009] [\cite=zhang-etal-NJoP-2011]. This has led to the strengthening conclusion that two-component materials are the necessary ingredient to produce ordered quantum dots [\cite=macko-etal-NanoTech-2010].

This growing consensus has resulted in a number of theoretical treatments of irradiated binary materials, describing both the morphology and the concentration evolution. Built on the pioneering work Shenoy, Chan, and Chason [\cite=shenoy-chan-chason-PRL-2007], Bradley and Shipman (BS) have recently introduced such a theory for binary materials exhibiting the first physically-grounded finite-wavelength bifurcation [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] [\cite=shipman-bradley-PRB-2011], which will be discussed in greater detail below. This result has sparked great interest, inspiring additional studies on normal-incidence irradiation of two-component materials [\cite=bradley-JAP-2012], including a variant where the second material is not originally present, but instead co-deposited simultaneously with the ion irradiation [\cite=bradley-PRB-2011c], and a similar framework for the study of ion-assisted deposition, where both materials are deposited along with the ions, and the deposition rate exceeds the sputtering rate [\cite=abrasonis-morawetz-PRB-2012].

In addition to dealing in some way with two materials, all of the papers cited in the previous paragraph share an important common trait: they assume the presence of ordinary, Fickian diffusion, in which atoms of each species diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. However, this assumption is not obviously valid: preferential sputtering of one material can lead to residual concentrations that are not energetically favorable. In this case spinodal decomposition is generically expected if the atoms are sufficiently mobile, and although temperatures of ion-irradiated targets are too low to allow thermally-driven segregation, it is known that ion irradiation enhances atomic mobility by several orders of magnitude [\cite=umbach-etal-PRL-2001]. Additional motivation to consider this effect comes from the significant restrictions on (unknown) parameter values required by the BS theory for the production of a finite-wavelength instability. Finally, Le Roy and co-workers have recently observed intriguing Ga-enriched 'caps' atop nanostructures on irradiated GaSB [\cite=le-roy-etal-JAP-2009], which were then observed with qualitative agreement in a numerical simulation of the phase separation process [\cite=le-roy-etal-PRB-2010-phase-separation].

Unfortunately, comparison of the latter work on phase separation to the BS model is hampered by the fact that the former study was performed numerically, rather than analytically, with no analysis of the linear instability leading to pattern formation. Hence, in the present work, we propose a generalized framework in which both linear instabilities can be analyzed, and in which the associated implications for experiment can be compared. Our central result is that spinodal decomposition allows a second finite-wavelength bifurcation, distinct from the bifurcation of Bradley and Shipman, that places fewer restrictions on the unknown parameters and can be clearly distinguished from it by a 180-degree shift in the relative phases of the height field and the concentration field. This result suggests that both atomistic studies of specific parameter values, and experimental measurement of the composition profile at the early stages of dot formation, would be equally valuable guides to further theoretical progress.

Model

Although the ultimate goal is to understand the formation and properties of high aspect ratio dots at late experimental times, in this work we will focus exclusively on the linear problem associated with small amplitudes and very early times in the pattern-forming process, for two reasons. First, a nonlinear analysis can only be as accurate as the linear instability out of which it grows, and experimental confirmation of linear models is still being sought. Second, once a long-wavelength bifurcation has been identified in an isotropic linear system, hexagonal order in the resulting nonlinear structures is actually quite generic [\cite=cross-hohenberg-RoMP-1993] [\cite=cross-greenside-2009-book]. To that end, we here consider the model

[formula]

describing the (linearized) evolution of perturbations to a steadily-eroding, flat film of a binary material at its steady-state concentration. Here h represents the deviation of the surface height profile from that of a steadily-eroded flat surface, and c represents the perturbation to the concentration of the atomic species that is more easily sputtered by the ion beam. Although we have in mind as an experimental reference the irradiation of GaSb, equations of this type arise generically in linear analyses of various kinds of binary material irradiation, including the sputtering of a binary material [\cite=shenoy-chan-chason-PRL-2007] [\cite=le-roy-etal-PRB-2010-phase-separation] [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] [\cite=shipman-bradley-PRB-2011] [\cite=bradley-JAP-2012], sputtering of a pure material with impurity co-deposition [\cite=bradley-PRB-2011c], and ion-assisted growth of a binary material [\cite=abrasonis-morawetz-PRB-2012]. However, no existing works included all of the terms in Eqs. ([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution])-([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]), which represent a superset of existing studies.

Detailed derivations of each of the terms on the right hand side of Eqns.([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution])-([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]) are available in references [\cite=shenoy-chan-chason-PRL-2007] [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] [\cite=le-roy-thesis-2010]. Here, we give here only a brief, qualitative description of the meanings of each term.

In Eq.([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution]) describing the height field: (1) the term - Ac (with A > 0 by choice) describes the preferential sputtering of species c [\cite=shenoy-chan-chason-PRL-2007], so that elevated concentration of c leads to enhanced erosion; (2) the term [formula] describes a net mass flux caused by unequal diffusivities between the components; (3) the term [formula] measures the dependence of the mass flux on the height gradient, and captures the net effects of both curvature dependent sputtering and mass redistribution [\cite=bradley-harper-JVST-1988] [\cite=carter-vishnyakov-PRB-1996]; (4) the term [formula] (with D > 0 by definition) describes many kinds of surface relaxation [\cite=bradley-harper-JVST-1988] [\cite=umbach-etal-PRL-2001], and regularizes the height dependence in the case that C is negative; (5) the term [formula] would describe a net mass flux from regions of fast concentration change to regions of slow concentration change via differing atomic mobilities.

In Eq.([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]) describing the concentration field: (1) the term -  αc (with α > 0 by definition) describes the continual resupply of material into the (c-depleted) irradiated film at the bulk concentration; (2) the term [formula] describes simple Fickian diffusion (if positive) or spinodal decomposition (if negative); (3) the term [formula] describes species-dependent redistribution [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010]; (4) The term [formula] would describe preferential migration of species c away from regions of high curvature, due to differing atomic mobilites; (5) the term [formula] (with ε > 0 by definition) describes an energetic penalty for rapid variations in concentration, and serves to regularize the equations in the case that β is negative (spinodal decomposition).

Comment 1.

Equations ([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution])-([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]) have between them fully ten parameters, most of which are difficult to measure experimentally, and nontrivial to measure even with atomistic simulation (see, e.g. [\cite=norris-etal-NCOMM-2011] [\cite=samela-etal-NIMB-2011] [\cite=hossain-etal-APL-2011]). To slightly simplify our task we follow the reasoning of Bradley and Shipman [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] and eliminate the highest-order cross-dependencies between h and c by setting E = δ = 0. We also assume here that the diffusivities of the two species are equal, which causes B = 0 as seen in [\cite=shenoy-chan-chason-PRL-2007] [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010]. The resulting seven terms still represent a considerable number, but we argue strongly that this represents the minimum number of terms required to address the question of whether the instability is driven by morphology or composition. In particular, A, D, α, and ε are all positive by definition, leaving only the signs of C, β, and γ undetermined. We therefore anticipate that system behavior will be especially sensitive to the signs of these three parameters. Finally, despite the number of parameters, we intentionally avoid the common procedure of reducing their number via non-dimensionalzation: despite its appeal, this can obscure implicit sign assumptions on the one hand, and physical interpretation on the other.

Stability Analysis

To investigate the stability of the system, we perform a linear stability analysis, introducing an infinitesimal sinusoidal perturbation away from steady state to both the height and concentration fields. Because the system is isotropic, we may without loss of generality orient this instability in one co-ordinate direction only; we choose the x-coordinate here, giving

[formula]

where k is the wavenumber of the perturbation, [formula] is the dispersion relation for the growth rate of that perturbation, and h1 and c1 are undetermined constants describing the relative phases and magnitudes of the height and concentration modulations. We then insert the perturbation ([\ref=eqn:_infinitesimal-perturbation]) into the governing equations ([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution])-([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]) in order to find the dispersion relation [formula].

The value of k that maximizes [formula] - denoted k* - is called the most unstable mode; if [formula], then the system is stable, whereas if [formula], the system is unstable. In between these regimes is the case [formula], which describes a set of points in parameter space called the neutral stability boundary, at which the system changes from stable to unstable in a bifurcation. If the bifurcation occurs for k* = 0, it is said to be longwave, because the wavelength of the most unstable mode approaches infinity. However, if it occurs for some finite value [formula], the bifurcation is said to be finite-wavelength, since the most unstable mode has a finite wavelength of λ = 2π / k*. Generically, long wave bifurcations lead to disordered kinetic roughening phenomena, whereas finite-wavelength bifurcations lead to ordered patterns [\cite=cross-hohenberg-RoMP-1993] [\cite=cross-greenside-2009-book].

Inserting the perturbation ([\ref=eqn:_infinitesimal-perturbation]) into the governing equations ([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution]) and ([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]), we obtain

[formula]

or in matrix form,

[formula]

This equation has non-trivial solution for [formula] only if the determinant of the matrix is zero; which condition gives the dispersion relation [formula] - the growth rate σ of a Fourier mode of wavenumber k - in the quadratic form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are respectively the trace and determinant of ([\ref=eqn:_stability-matrix]) when σ = 0:

[formula]

For the purpose of identifying stability properties, it is sufficient to consider only the root associated with the '+' sign in the quadratic formula which, following common practice, is denoted [formula]:

[formula]

This gives the growth rate of the faster-growing solution.

Given the quadratic nature of the equation for [formula], it is in general not possible to obtain a simple closed-form expression for the most unstable mode k*. However, from the form of Equation [\ref=eqn:_quadratic-solution-of-sigma], we see that the system is stable if both τ > 0 and σ > 0, but unstable if either one is negative. Hence, a bifurcation from stability to instability occurs when either

[formula]

or

[formula]

Hence, it is sufficient to examine these two criteria independently. As described elsewhere, both in general [\cite=cross-greenside-2009-book] and in the context of ion irradiation [\cite=abrasonis-morawetz-PRB-2012], these two possibilities produce different kinds of instability: if [formula] but [formula], the growth rate is real and the instability is stationary; however, if [formula] but [formula], the growth rate is complex and the instability is oscillatory.

The limit k  →    ∞  : well-posedness

In part to justify the inclusion of so many terms in our linearized Eqns.([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution])-([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]), it is instructive to consider the limit k  →    ∞  . All well-posed physical problems should exhibit [formula]; i.e., that very-small scale perturbations are stable, and consequently, the system will not exhibit any significant variations on scales smaller than a certain threshhold. If the limiting value were positive, it would imply the presence of variation on infinitely-small scales, violating the continuum hypothesis and suggesting that additional physical terms were necessary in the model.

From Equations ([\ref=eqn:_tau])-([\ref=eqn:_quadratic-solution-of-sigma]) we quickly find that

[formula]

because ε > 0 by definition we see that our equations are well-posed. If we were to neglect the term [formula], then we would find instead that

[formula]

this is well-posed only if β > 0. Hence, the case of phase separation (β < 0) is not well-posed without the inclusion of the term [formula].

The limit [formula]: behavior of long waves

It is also highly useful to examine the limit [formula] associated with long-wavelength perturbations. Examining Eqns. ([\ref=eqn:_tau])-([\ref=eqn:_quadratic-solution-of-sigma]) in the limit as [formula], we find that for small values of k

[formula]

Notably, Eqn.([\ref=eqn:_mclauren]) depends only on the coefficients of the lowest-order derivatives on h and c, and would therefore continue to hold even if no terms had been neglected from Equations ([\ref=eqn:_linear-height-evolution])-([\ref=eqn:_linear-concentration-evolution]). We recall that A measures the extent to which the component c is preferentially sputtered, and that γ measures the extent to which this same component is preferentially redistributed. If atoms of the preferrentially-sputtered component are also preferentially redistributed when not sputtered, then Aγ > 0, leading to a roughening effect, in which c atoms are driven into the valleys ([formula]), which then experience enhanced erosion (ht  ~   - Ac). If this effect is stronger than a smoothing driven by the average rate of mass redistribution ([formula]), then then small values of k have positive growth rates; hence, there is a longwave instability leading ultimately to kinetic roughening phenomena.

This generic criteria can occur in various physical contexts. For example, in Ref.[\cite=bradley-PRB-2011c], an increasing impurity codeposition rate leads to increased values of γ relative to C, and the instability criteria Eq.(25) there is the condition γA > αC. Alternatively, in Ref.[\cite=bradley-JAP-2012], small amounts of the heavier component of a binary compound are posited to enhance the sputtering of the lighter, again increasing Aγ relative to αC, and the instability criteria Eqn.(16) there is again γA > αC. Finally, this instability is also documented in Ref.[\cite=abrasonis-morawetz-PRB-2012] as it applies to the stationary bifurcation in a growing film ([\ref=eqn:_stationary-bifurcation]). Due to its ubiquity and to simplify future discussion, we here propose a name for this instability. Because γA > 0 indicates that all displacements - either sputtering or redistribution - occur preferrentially for the same component, we suggest the name Preferential Displacement Instability (PDI).

Finite-Wavelength Requirement and Implications

Here, however, we are here concerned primarily with the formation of ordered patterns arising when the instability has a finite wavelength; the previous discussion serves mainly to reveals that a necessary condition for such behavior is the suppression of the PDI instability via

[formula]

Under the generic finite-wavelegnth restriction ([\ref=eqn:_finite-wavelength-requirement]), and with the parameters A, α, D, and ε all positive by definition, a further consideration of the polynomials for [formula] and [formula] reveals that a finite-wavelength instability is possible only if one or both of C and β are negative. These are notable criteria, because C < 0 implies the existence of a morphologically-driven instability even in the absence of concentration modulations ([formula]), whereas β < 0 admits the possibility of a compositionally-driven instability even in the absence of surface undulations ([formula]). In what follows, for clarity and the development of intuition, we will discuss the opposing single-mechanism regimes C < 0,β > 0 and C > 0,β < 0 emphasizing the contrast in both instability mechanism and experimental signature. The final regime C < 0,β < 0, in which both mechanisms are operating, is not considered.

Two Distinct Routes to Finite-wavelength bifurcation

We here present a qualitative discussion of two distinct regimes of finite-wavelength bifurcation. Because Eqn.([\ref=eqn:_Delta]) is eighth-order, exact bifurcation criteria are rather complicated. Here, we focus instead on differences in the signs of key parameters, and the effect on the relative signs of h1 and c1 in Eqn.([\ref=eqn:_stability-matrix]).

Morphological instability: C < 0, β > 0

The first finite-wavelength instability regime has recently been discovered by Bradley and Shipman [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] [\cite=shipman-bradley-PRB-2011], which we briefly summarize for comparative purposes. These authors study the model we have proposed, with the exception that they neglect the term [formula]. The lack of this regularizing term, in turn, requires that β > 0 for well-posedness. Consequently, as described above, instability is only possible if C is sufficiently negative. Finally, because these authors sought a finite-wavelength bifurcation, they imposed the finite-wavelength criteria ([\ref=eqn:_finite-wavelength-requirement]), which here becomes [formula].

From these considerations, at the bifurcation point σ = 0, the second row of the matrix ([\ref=eqn:_stability-matrix]) gives

[formula]

Because [formula] by assumption, and γ < 0 is required for a finite-wavelength bifurcation, one therefore obtains h1φ1 > 0, so that the concentration variations are in phase with the height variations - the preferentially-sputtered species is on the hilltops. The physical interpretation of this scenario is that the surface first undergoes undulations due to an erosive instability, after which the preferentially-redistributed species is driven into the valleys [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010]. The negative value of γ implies that the preferentially-sputtered species is not preferentially redistributed, and so this species is left on the hills.

Chemically-driven instability: C > 0, β < 0

With the inclusion of the [formula] term, it is no longer necessary to assume that β > 0, and here we explore the case β < 0. This describes a version of the linearized Cahn-Hilliard equation describing phase-separation [\cite=cahn-hilliard-1958:ch-equation], with the addition of a damping term -  αc due to material replenishment from the bulk. As motivated in the numerical investigation of Le Roy et al. [\cite=le-roy-etal-PRB-2010-phase-separation], the study of this regime for GaSb is reasonable given the presence of the line compound at the 50/50 composition line [\cite=hansen-elliot-shunk-1958-binary-alloys]. In addition, although the low temperatures typically associated with ion irradiation are far below those needed for thermal segregation, it is known that the ion beam induces an effective mobility in the target atoms that is many orders of magnitude higher than for an un-irradiated target [\cite=umbach-etal-PRL-2001]. Hence, β could not only be negative, but of significant magnitude. And as a consequence, a finite-wavelength bifurcation no longer requires C < 0.

Based on these observations, we now consider the case (C > 0, β < 0), and re-consider the bifurcation criteria ([\ref=eqn:_oscillatory-bifurcation])-([\ref=eqn:_stationary-bifurcation]). At the bifurcation point σ = 0, the first line of the matrix equation ([\ref=eqn:_stability-matrix]) gives

[formula]

Because both A > 0 and [formula] for all values of k, we therefore have h1φ1 < 0, so that the concentration variations are now out of phase with the height variations - i.e., the preferentially-sputtered species is in the valleys. A physical interpretation of this scenario, as suggested in the numerical study of Le Roy et al. [\cite=le-roy-etal-PRB-2010-phase-separation], is that preferential sputtering of Sb induces the material first to phase-separate into large regions of 50/50 GaSb containing small islands of enriched Ga, which then recede more slowly than the bulk of the surface.

Discussion

Following Bradley and Harper's seminal demonstration that the erosion process generates a negative contribution to C [\cite=bradley-harper-JVST-1988], it has long been assumed that C < 0, which would yield an unstable surface profile h even in the absence of concentration effects. The just discussed erosion-driven instability of Bradley and Shipman [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] is consistent with this tradition, and requires concentration effects only to stabilize the long-wavelength modes in order to yield a finite-wavelength bifurcation. However, despite its successful reception, we present here three reasons for considering alternate mechanisms.

First, besides atoms sputtered from the surface, the collision cascade associated with ion impact produces many atoms that remain on the surface, but are displaced to new locations. The effect of these displacements makes a positive contribution to C [\cite=carter-vishnyakov-PRB-1996], and very recently, experimental and atomistic studies of pure silicon have suggested that in fact this redistribution effect overwhelms the erosive effect, leading to a net value of C > 0 [\cite=madi-etal-PRL-2011] [\cite=norris-etal-NCOMM-2011]. Although binary systems are chemically different from pure silicon, it is important to note that the collision cascade leading to both erosion and redistribution is a purely kinetic process, and hence, the kinetic result that redistribution dominates over erosion is likely to persist in binary systems.

Second, it is frequently observed that irradiated silicon develops a compressive stress [\cite=van-dillen-etal-APL-2003-colloidal-ellipsoids] [\cite=kim-etal-JAP-2006-stressed-keV-films] [\cite=chan-chason-JVSTA-2008] [\cite=medhekar-etal-JPCM-2009] [\cite=george-etal-JAP-2010] [\cite=madi-thesis-2011], and various analytical studies of this effect have recently shown that it, also, makes positive contributions to C [\cite=castro-cuerno-ASS-2012] [\cite=norris-PRB-2012-viscoelastic-normal], despite initial speculation to the contrary [\cite=davidovitch-etal-PRB-2007] [\cite=madi-etal-2008-PRL]. Again, although the analogy with binary systems is not ensured, stress generation is likely to persist in binary systems as long as it is caused by the kinetic collision cascade. (However, see Ref.[\cite=ozaydin-etal-JVSTB-2008], in which the chemical reaction of Mo and Si to form [formula] leads to a tensile stress hypothesized to produce an instability.)

Third, the specific requirement on concentration effects from the BS theory is that γ <  - |C|α / A, so that the species more likely to be sputtered, is less likely to be redistributed if left on the surface. However, erosion and redistribution are merely different outcomes of the same kinetic process - a displaced atom either has enough momentum away from the surface to escape, or it does not. From this perspective, it is not immediately intuitive that a single species would be both less likely to be displaced far from its initial position, but simultaneously more likely to escape the target.

The significant restrictions on the unknown parameters C and γ are an important additional motivation to investigate the plausibility of phase separation in driving ordered patterns. As we have seen, if β is sufficiently negative to drive a bifurcation via phase separation, then there is much more flexibility in the values of C and γ. First, C could be positive, allowing ordered patterns even if the destabilizing erosion process is not strong enough to dominate other, competing stabilizing processes. And second, a positive C would also serve to stabilize long-wave disturbances via Eq.([\ref=eqn:_finite-wavelength-requirement]), allowing the possibility that the same component is both preferentially sputtered and redistributed.

Conclusions

The primary contribution of this work is the introduction of a generalized linear framework in which both kinetically- and chemically-driven instabilities can be compared analytically. Our main finding is that phase separation admits a second finite-wavelength instability, which exhibits the opposite experimental signature of the BS instability: the erosion-driven BS instability requiring C < 0 and γ < 0 exhibits concentration modulations of the preferentially-sputtered species that are in phase with the height modulations, whereas the chemistry-driven instability driven by β < 0 exhibits out-of-phase modulations. Unfortunately, although both mechanisms have been plausibly motivated already in the literature [\cite=bradley-shipman-PRL-2010] [\cite=le-roy-etal-PRB-2010-phase-separation], better data are urgently needed to choose between them, and the main utility of our study is to suggest two specific routes to resolving the question of which mechanism is dominant.

Regarding parameter values, existing studies on pure Si [\cite=norris-etal-NCOMM-2011] [\cite=hossain-etal-APL-2011] have been successful in comparing the relative contributions of erosion and net redistribution to the value of C. Such studies could be generalized for the two-component GaSb system without much alteration. In addition, they could simultaneously investigate the value of γ, which describes preferential redistribution. If both parameters were found to be negative for GaSb, it would bolster the BS theory, while if either were found to be positive, it would instead support phase separation.

Experimentally, it would be invaluable to determine the relative phases of Ga and Sb at the early stages of pattern formation. Notably, disagreement currently exists within the literature. As mentioned above, using ex-situ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) applied to a single nanostructure, Le Roy et al. observe very well-defined Ga-rich caps at the top of the structure [\cite=le-roy-etal-JAP-2009]. However, using low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) applied to a large array of nanostructures tilted at various angles, El-Atwani et al. come to the opposite conclusion, suggesting that the peaks of such structures may instead by Sb-rich[\cite=el-atwani-etal-JAP-2011]. In addition to these conflicting observations, both studies focus on late times, after a well-defined pattern has already developed, in contrast to the early times associated with linear analysis.
