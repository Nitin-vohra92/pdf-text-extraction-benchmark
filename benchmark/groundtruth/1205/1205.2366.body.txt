P-Odd Pion Azimuthal Charge Correlations in Heavy Ion Collisions

introduction

Large single spin asymmetries in dedicated semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering were reported by both the CLAS and the HERMES collaborations [\cite=hermes2000] [\cite=hermes2005] [\cite=hermes2009] [\cite=clas2010]. Similarly large spin asymmetries were reported by the STAR and PHENIX collaborations  [\cite=star2008] [\cite=Eyser:2006bc] [\cite=fnal1991] in pion production using a polarized proton beam at collider energies. These large spin asymmetries are due to chirality flip contributions in the scattering amplitude that are not supported by QCD perturbation theory and factorization.

The QCD vacuum supports large instanton-antinstanton fluctuations that are non-perturbative in nature and a natural source for chirality flip effects. QCD instantons are hedgehog in color-spin, that makes them ideal for triggering large spin asymmetries [\cite=Forte:1989ia] [\cite=Forte:1990xb] [\cite=Ioffe:1990xm] [\cite=Kochelev:1999nd] [\cite=dorokhov2009] [\cite=ostrovsky2005] [\cite=Qian:2011ya] [\cite=Qian:2014]. These large chirality flip contributions are beyond the realm of factorization and provides a QCD based quantitative mechanism for large spin effects in the initial state (Sivers) [\cite=sivers1990] [\cite=sivers1991].

In this note we would like to argue that the chirality flips from instanton and anti-instanton in polarized proton-proton collisions may cause, through vacuum topological fluctuations, large pion azimuthal correlations in peripheral heavy ion collisions, thanks to the large induced magnetic field in the prompt phase of the collision. The organization of this note is as follows: we first briefly review the origin of some of the chirality flip effects in the QCD vacuum. We then argue that in peripheral heavy ion collisions, a substantial magnetic field could trigger large polarizations in the protons participating in the collisions. These effects lead to large pion azimuthal correlations that are comparable to those recently reported by the STAR and ALICE collaborations. Our conclusions follow.

P-Odd Effects in the Instanton Vacuum

In a typical non-central AuAu collision at RHIC as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=aacollision], the flying fragments create a large magnetic field that strongly polarizes the wounded or participant nucleons. The magnetic field is typically eB / m2π  ≈  1 at RHIC and eB / m2π  ≈  15 at the LHC lasting for about 1-3 fm / c [\cite=Skokov:2009qp]. We recall that in these units m2π  ≈  1018  Gauss which is substantial and therefore a major source of prompt proton polarization. Polarized proton on proton scattering can exhibit large chirality flip effects through instanton and anti-instanton fluctuations as we now show.

Consider the typical parton-parton scattering amplitude of Fig.[\ref=gluonexchange] with 2-gluon exchanges. In each collision, the colliding "parton" pi has spin si, and thus [formula]. The parton p1 from the A-nucleus encounters an instanton or anti-instanton as depicted by the gluonic form-factor. The latter follows from standard instanton calculus [\cite=Kochelev:1996pv]

[formula]

with γ± = (1  ±  γ5) / 2 and

[formula]

and [formula] with Fg(0) = 1. Here nI  ≈  1 / fm4 is the effective instanton density, ρc  ≈  1 / 3  fm the typical instanton size and m*q  ≈  300  Mev the constitutive quark mass in the instanton vacuum. The momenta of the incoming partons as well as the momentum Q of the transferred gluon are assumed small or pρc,Qρc  ≤  1. [formula] stands for an instanton insertion and [formula] for an anti-instanton insertion. In establishing ([\ref=VERTEX]), the instanton and anti-instanton zero modes are assumed to be undistorted by the prompt external magnetic field. Specifically, the chromo-magnetic field BG is much stronger than the electro-magnetic field B, i.e. |gsBG|  ≫  |eB|  ≈   or m2πρ2c  ≈  0.004  ≪  1. The deformation of the instanton zero-modes by a strong magnetic field have been discussed in [\cite=Basar:2011by]. They will not be considered here.

In terms of ([\ref=VERTEX]), the contribution of Fig.[\ref=gluonexchange] to the differential cross section is

[formula]

which can be decomposed into dσ  ≈  dσ(0) + dσ(1) in the dilute instanton liquid. The zeroth order contribution is

[formula]

where we used [formula]. The first order contribution is

[formula]

after using p1  ·  s1  =  0 and p21  =  k2  =  0. Converting to standard parton kinematics with p1  →  x1P1, p2  →  x2P2 and k  →  K  /  z, we obtain for the ratio of the P-odd to P-even contributions in the differential cross section

[formula]

Now consider the kinematics appropriate for the collision set up in Fig. [\ref=aacollision],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the transverse momentum and total squared energy of the outgoing pion respectively. xF is the pion longitudinal momentum fraction. Thus

[formula]

We note that Eq. [\ref=crosssection] vanishes after averaging over the instanton liquid background which is P-even

[formula]

since on average [formula].

P-odd correlations in AA Collisions through Instantons

Now consider hard pp collisions in peripheral AA collisions as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=aacollision]. The Magnetic field is strong enough to polarize the colliding protons. For simplicity, we set [formula] and [formula], with Δsu(x,Q2) and Δsd(x,Q2) as the spin polarized distribution functions of the valence up-quarks and valence down-quarks in the proton respectively. We also assume that the outgoing u quark turns to π+ and that the outgoing d quark turns to π-. With this in mind, we may rewrite the ratio of differential contributions in ([\ref=crosssection]) following [\cite=Abelev:2009ac] [\cite=Abelev:2009ad] [\cite=collaboration:2011sma] [\cite=Selyuzhenkov:2012py] as

[formula]

with α  =    ±   or

[formula]

and

[formula]

While on average [formula] since [formula], in general [formula] for the 2-particle correlations. Explicitly

[formula]

According to [\cite=Hirai:2006sr] [\cite=Adams:1997dp], Δsu(x,Q2) / u(x,Q2)  =  0.959  -  0.588(1  -  x1.048) and Δsd(x,Q2) / d(x,Q2)  =    -  0.773  +  0.478(1 - x1.243). For reasonable values of [formula], [formula] as expected [\cite=Abelev:2009ac] [\cite=Abelev:2009ad] [\cite=collaboration:2011sma] [\cite=Selyuzhenkov:2012py].

A more quantitative comparison to the reported data in  [\cite=Abelev:2009ac] [\cite=Selyuzhenkov:2012py] can be carried out by estimating the fluctuations of the topological charge [formula] in the prompt collision 4-volume [formula]. In the latter, τ  ≈   1-3 fm is the prompt proper time over which the induced magnetic field is active, Δη is the interval in pseudo-rapidity and [formula] the transverse collision area for fixed impact parameter b. Through simple geometry

[formula]

where R is the radius of two identically colliding nuclei. [formula] involves a pair [formula] of instanton-antiinstanton. Specifically,

[formula]

If we denote by N± the number of instantons and antinstantons in V, with N = N+ + N- their total number, then in the instanton vacuum the pair correlation follows from

[formula]

The deviation from the Poissonian distribution in the variance of the number average reflects on the QCD trace anomaly in the instanton vacuum or [formula]  [\cite=Diakonov:1983hh]. Here [formula] is the coefficient of the 1-loop beta function [formula] (quenched). Thus

[formula]

The topological fluctuations are suppressed by the large collision 4-volume. Note that we have ignored the role of the temperature on the the topological fluctuations in peripheral collisions. Temperature will cause these topological fluctuations to deplete and vanish at the chiral transition point following the instanton-anti-instanton pairing [\cite=Janik:1999ps]. So our results will be considered as upper-bounds.

For simplicity, we assume [formula] for each parton and [formula]. We also fix τ  =  3  fm to be the maximum duration of the magnetic field polarization, and set the pseudo-rapidity interval to ( - 4,4) for STAR and ( - 5,5) for ALICE. The radius of the colliding nuclei will be set to [formula] where A is the atomic number. The centrality is approximated as n%  =  b2 / (2R)2 [\cite=Aguiar:2004uq]. Our results are displayed in Fig. [\ref=auau] for AuAu and Fig. [\ref=cucu] for CuCu collisions at [formula] (STAR), and in Fig. [\ref=pbpb] for PbPb collisions at [formula] (ALICE). We recall that [\cite=Voloshin:2004vk]

[formula]

For the like-charges the results compare favorably with the data. For the unlike charges they overshoot the data especially for the heavier ion. Since the magnetic field changes with the impact parameter b [\cite=Skokov:2009qp], it follows that full proton polarization is only taking place at 30% and higher centralities. We have checked that the magnetically weighted results with the impact parameter do not differ quantitatively from the unweighted results presented in Figs. [\ref=auau]-[\ref=pbpb].

conclusions

Large chirality flips from instanton and anti-instanton contributions as assessed in polarized pp experiments may contribute substantially to P-odd azimuthal correlations in unpolarized AA collisions at RHIC and LHC, thanks to the topological fuctuations in the QCD vacuum and a large induced magnetic field in the prompt part of the collision. The effect is stronger in peripheral collisions and subsede in central collisions. Simple estimates based on the collision geometry and the magnetic field profile, compare favorably to the currently reported pion azimuthal charge correlations by the STAR and ALICE collaborations. Our arguments involve only polarized protons in the presence of topological fluctuations in the confined vacuum, and therefore complement the chiral magnetic effect suggested in the deconfined vacuum [\cite=Kharzeev:1998kz] [\cite=Kharzeev:2004ey] [\cite=Kharzeev:2007jp] [\cite=Fukushima:2008xe].
