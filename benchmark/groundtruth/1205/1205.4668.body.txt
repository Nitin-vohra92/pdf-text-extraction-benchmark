A Cantor set with hyperbolic complement

Recall that a Cantor set is a metrizable compactum which is totally disconnected and has no isolated points. While any two Cantor sets are homeomorphic to each other, it is well-known that there are Cantor sets embedded in Euclidean space such that no homeomorphism between them extends to an ambient self-homeomorphism. The first example of this phenomenon is due to Antoine [\cite=Antoine] who constructed a Cantor set in [formula] whose complement is not simply connected, and hence not homeomorphic to the complement of the standard dyadic Cantor set. Following Antoine's work there has been a small industry devoted to constructing examples of wild Cantor sets in [formula], or more generally [formula], having various pathological properties; see for example [\cite=Bestvina-Cooper] [\cite=Bing] [\cite=DO] [\cite=FS] [\cite=Sher] [\cite=Skora] and the references therein. In this note we construct yet another example of a wild Cantor set:

To construct the Cantor set C provided by Theorem [\ref=sat1] we will mimic the construction of Antoine's necklace, using knotted and linked θ-graphs instead of circles. The bulk of the work is to give a sufficient condition for an open manifold with infinite topology to admit a complete hyperbolic metric. More concretely, we prove that an open 3-manifold is hyperbolic if it admits a nested exhaustion [formula] such that the closure of [formula] is acylindrical for all n and such that the genus of each component of ∂Kn is bounded by some constant independent of n. This result is not going to surprise any expert on Kleinian groups, and the proof uses rather standard arguments.

In this note we just prove Theorem [\ref=sat1] as stated above. However, an argument that is painful but relatively straightforward for experts shows that the Cantor set C can also be constructed so that any two orientation preserving embeddings of [formula] into [formula] are isotopic to each other (compare with [\cite=balkanic] [\cite=Kent-Souto]). One can also construct C in such a way that the hyperbolic metric on [formula] is unique up to isometry. In fact, the following is, at least from the point of view of Kleinian groups, an interesting question:

Also, note that, as is the case with Antoine's necklace [\cite=Sher], one can use Theorem [\ref=sat1] to construct uncountably many homeomorphism classes of Cantor set complements in [formula] admitting a complete hyperbolic metric.

This paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=sec-top] we discuss a few facts from 3-dimensional topology used later on. In section [\ref=sec-geom] we show that 3-manifolds that admit what we call a nested exhaustion with truly excellent gaps are hyperbolic. Theorem [\ref=sat1] is proved in section [\ref=sec-cantor].

Following Myers [\cite=Myers], we say that a compact orientable 3-manifold M is excellent if it is irreducible, atoroidal, and acylindrical. An excellent 3-manifold all of whose boundary components have negative Euler characteristic is truly excellent. Suppose that M is a compact orientable 3-manifold whose boundary ∂M does not contain 2-spheres. It follows from Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture that M is truly excellent if and only if its fundamental group π1(M) is infinite, does not contain [formula] as a subgroup, and splits neither over the trivial group nor over [formula]. Yet another characterization, due to Thurston in the presence of boundary and to Perelman in general, is that a compact manifold M is truly excellent if and only if it admits a hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary.

Later on we will need to use over and over again that appropriately glued truly excellent 3-manifolds yield again a truly excellent manifold. Before stating what we will need in a lemma, recall that a subgroup H of a group G is malnormal if

[formula]

In terms of covering theory this translates to the following fact: if X is a simply connected space on which G acts freely and discretely, and if γ,γ'  ⊂  X / H are homotopically essential closed curves whose images under the covering map π:X / H  →  X / G are equal, π(γ) = π(γ'), then γ  =  γ'.

Suppose that N is a compact oriented 3-manifold with boundary ∂N and that S  ⊂  ∂N a disconnected subsurface of the boundary. Let τ:S  →  S be an orientation reversing involution that preserves no connected component of S. Finally, consider the oriented manifold M = N / τ obtained by gluing N according to τ and suppose that

N is truly excellent,

each component of S has negative Euler characteristic and is π1-injective in ∂N, and

∂M does not contain tori.

Then M is truly excellent, and moreover:

The image of every component Σ of S under the inclusion π:N  →  M is a 2-sided incompressible surface.

If Σ (resp. U) is a connected component of S (resp. N) then the subgroup π*(π1(S)) (resp. π*(π1(U))) is malnormal in π1(M).

Lemma [\ref=gluing] follows either easily from standard innermost arguments (see [\cite=Myers]) or from well-known results from Bass-Serre theory on amalgamating groups along a common malnormal subgroup. We leave the details to the reader.

Let M be a complete open hyperbolic 3-manifold, K a truly excellent compact 3-manifold, and ι:K  →  M a homotopy equivalence. If the restriction of ι to ∂K is an embedding, then ι is homotopic relative to ∂K to an embedding ι':K  →  M.

Since K is compact and M is homotopy equivalent to K, π1(M) is finitely generated. In particular, M is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold [formula] [\cite=Agol] [\cite=CG], and we can assume that ι(K) is contained in the interior of [formula]. The homotopy equivalence ι:K  →   is homotopic to a homeomorphism τ:K  →   [\cite=Johannson]. Now, let S  ⊂  ∂K be a boundary component of K. Since ι(S) and τ(S) are disjoint, π1-injective, and homotopic, it follows from Waldhausen's cobordism theorem [\cite=Waldhausen] that there is US  ⊂   homeomorphic to S  ×  [0,1] with [formula].

Notice that if S'  ⊂  ∂K is another boundary component of K then we have [formula], meaning that either ι(S')  ⊂  US or [formula]. We rule out the former possibility: If ι(S')  ⊂  US then it is a closed embedded π1-injective surface in the trivial interval bundle US and hence is isotopic to the boundary components of US. Since ι is a homotopy equivalence, this implies that S and S' are homotopic in K, but this contradicts the assumption that K is truly excellent. This proves that [formula] for all [formula]. Notice that the same argument shows that [formula] for all distinct boundary components S,S'  ⊂  ∂K of K. Finally, let [formula] be the submanifold of [formula] obtained by removing [formula] for all S  ⊂  ∂K, and notice that the homotopy equivalence ι:K  →  M is homotopic relative to ∂K to a homotopy equivalence :K  →   whose restriction to ∂K is a homeomorphism onto ∂. The homotopy equivalence :K  →   is homotopic relative to ∂K to a homeomorphism ι':K  →    ⊂  M [\cite=Waldhausen]. This is our desired embedding.

Let M and M' be hyperbolic 3-manifolds, π:M  →  M' be a covering, K  ⊂  M a compact core, and assume that π*(π1(K)) is malnormal in π1(M'). If the restriction of π to ∂K is an embedding, then so is the restriction of π to K.

Recall that a compact core of a 3-manifold M is a compact submanifold K such that the inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence, and observe that every manifold admitting a compact core has finitely generated fundamental group. We also note that in the statement of Lemma [\ref=lem2] we do not assume that π1(M') is finitely generated.

Notice that it suffices to prove that if x∈∂K and y∈K are two points with π(x) = π(y), then x = y. Let S  ⊂  ∂K be the connected component containing x, consider its image π(S), and let S' be the component of π- 1(π(S)) with y∈S'. Notice that S'  ⊂  K. In particular, compactness of K implies that S' is compact and hence that the cover π|S':S'  →  S is finite-to-one.

It follows that there are two curves γ  ⊂  S and γ'  ⊂  S' which are essential in π1(M) such that π(γ) = π(γ'). The condition that π*(π1(K)) is a malnormal subgroup of π1(M') implies that γ  =  γ' and hence that [formula]. Since both S and S' are components of the preimage of the embedded surface π(S), it follows that S' = S and thus that y∈S. Injectivity of π on S implies that π(x) = π(y), as we needed to prove.

In this note we will be interested in 3-manifolds obtained by gluing truly excellent manifolds along their boundaries. More concretely we consider open manifolds M which admit a nested exhaustion with truly excellent gaps

[formula]

by which we mean that Kn is contained in the interior of Kn + 1 and that the closure of [formula] is a truly excellent manifold for all n. We prove:

Every open 3-manifold which admits a nested exhaustion with truly excellent gaps

[formula]

such that there is an upper bound for the genus of the connected components of [formula] is homeomorphic to a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold.

Suppose throughout this section that M and Kn are as in the statement of Proposition [\ref=kor-metric] and fix *  ∈K1. Before launching into the proof of the proposition, observe that Lemma [\ref=gluing] implies:

Kn is truly excellent for all n  ≥  1.

If S  ⊂  ∂Kn is a connected component of the boundary of Kn, then S is incompressible in M.

If S  ⊂  ∂Kn and S'  ⊂  ∂Km are connected components of the boundary of Kn and Km with n,m  ≥  1 such that there are essential curves γ  ⊂  S and γ'  ⊂  S' which are freely homotopic in M then n = m, S = S' and γ and γ' are in fact freely homotopic within S.

π1(M, * ) is the nested union of the subgroups π1(Kn, * ).

π1(Kn, * ) is malnormal in π1(M, * ) for all n  ≥  1.

Also, notice that since M is the nested union of aspherical manifolds, it is aspherical as well.

We divide the proof of Proposition [\ref=kor-metric] into two separate statements:

The manifold M is homotopy equivalent to a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold M'.

Since Kn is excellent for all n  ≥  1, there is a discrete and faithful representation

[formula]

See [\cite=Kapovich] [\cite=Ota98]. Fixing k, for each for n  ≥  k we can restrict the representation ρn to the subgroup π1(Kk, * ) of π1(Kn, * ). Since each of the manifolds Kk is excellent, it follows from Thurston's compactness theorem [\cite=Thurston] that there is a sequence [formula] such that for all γ∈π1(Kk, * ) the sequence (gnρn(γ)g- 1n) is relatively compact in [formula]. In particular, conjugating our representations and passing to a diagonal subsequence we can assume that the limit

[formula]

exists for all γ∈π1(Kk, * ) and for all k. Since [formula] we therefore obtain a representation

[formula]

It is discrete and faithful by work of Jø rgensen [\cite=jorgmarden]. In particular, [formula] is a hyperbolic 3-manifold with π1(M')≃π1(M). Since both M and M' are aspherical, it follows that they are homotopy equivalent.

We now prove that M and the manifold M' provided by Lemma [\ref=hom-metric] are not only homotopy equivalent but actually homeomorphic:

M and M' are homeomorphic.

Choose a homotopy equivalence φ:M  →  M' and set

[formula]

Every connected component S of S is π1-injective; it follows that φ(S) is homotopic to an immersed least area surface in M' [\cite=SY]. We can thus assume, up to replacing φ by a homotopic map, that the restriction of φ to S is a minimal immersion for all components S of S.

We now claim that the restriction of φ to S is proper. In fact, if that were not the case then there would be a sequence (Sk) of distinct components of S and a sequence of points pk∈Sk such that φ(pk) has a limit in M'. Endow Sk with the pulled-back Riemannian metric and notice that, since φ|Sk is a minimal immersion, this metric has curvature bounded from above by - 1. Since, by assumption, Sk has genus uniformly bounded from above, there is C such that Sk has at most area C for all k. Therefore, there is some constant D > 0 such that for all k there is a homotopically essential loop γk  ⊂  Sk based at pk whose image φ(γk) has at most length D. Since the points φ(pk) converge in M', it follows that the loops φ(γk) belong to finitely many free homotopy classes in M'. In other words, there are l  ≠  k such that φ(γk) and φ(γl) represent the same conjugacy class in π1(M'). Since φ is a homotopy equivalence, it follows that γk and γl also represent the same conjugacy class in π1(M); as we noted above this is not possible. This shows that the restriction of φ to S is proper.

We next prove that the restriction of φ to S is an embedding. Properness implies that it suffices to show that the restriction of φ to [formula] is an embedding for all n. Notice that there is some N  ≥  n such that a neighborhood of the set φ(Kn) lifts homeomorphically under the cover [formula]. Now consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

The manifold [formula] is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold N by the tameness theorem [\cite=Agol] [\cite=CG]. Moreover, since KN is excellent it follows from [\cite=Johannson] that the map φ̃:KN  →  N is homotopic to a homeomorphism. In particular, this implies that φ̃(Sn) is homotopic to an embedded surface. Since φ̃(Sn) is a π1-injective least area surface and since two curves in Sn which are homotopic in M are also homotopic within Sn, it follows from [\cite=FHS] that the restriction of φ̃ to Sn is an embedding. Since the restriction of π to φ̃(Kn) is a homeomorphism onto φ(Kn), it follows that the restriction of φ to Sn is also an embedding. This proves that φ maps S homeomorphically onto its image.

At this point we are ready to finish the proof. It suffices to prove that for every natural number n, the restriction of φ to the closure Un of [formula] is homotopic rel ∂Un  ⊂  S to an embedding. Consider the cover [formula] and observe that we have a diagram as follows:

[formula]

Since the restriction of φ to ∂Un  ⊂  S is an embedding, we deduce that the restriction of φ̃ to each ∂Un is also an embedding. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem1] that φ̃ is homotopic relative to ∂Un to an embedding [formula]. Since ψ̃(Un) is a compact core of [formula], Lemma [\ref=lem2] implies that that [formula] is also an embedding.

Proposition [\ref=kor-metric] follows directly from Lemma [\ref=hom-metric] and Lemma [\ref=homeo-metric].

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=sat1]. The basic idea is to modify the construction of Antoine's necklace by replacing each link of the necklace by a graph. A (piecewise linearly) embedded finite graph X in a manifold M with possibly non-empty boundary is properly embedded if [formula] is precisely equal to the set of vertices of X with valence 1. If X  ⊂  M is any such properly embedded graph then we denote by N(X) an open regular neighborhood of X. A properly embedded graph X  ⊂  M is truly excellent if [formula] is truly excellent.

In the proof of the Theorem [\ref=sat1] we will make heavy use of the following result which is basically due to Myers [\cite=Myers] (see also [\cite=Kent-Souto]):

After these remarks we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=sat1]:

We will construct a sequence [formula] of compact 3-manifolds in [formula] starting with [formula] and satisfying the following conditions for all n  ≥  1:

Each Vn is contained in the interior of Vn - 1 and the closure of [formula] is truly excellent.

Each component of ∂Vn has genus 2.

Each component of Vn - 1 contains at least two components of Vn.

For any sequence of components Un  ⊂  Vn, [formula], where [formula] is the diameter in the spherical metric on [formula].

Assuming for a moment that such a sequence exists, we conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=sat1]. The set [formula] is an intersection of compact sets and hence compact. Moreover, (3) implies that it is totally disconnected and (2) yields in turn that C has no isolated points. In other words, C is a Cantor set. Now let Kn be the closure of [formula] for n  ≥  1 and notice that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=kor-metric] applies by (1), which implies that [formula] admits a complete hyperbolic metric, as we wanted to show.

It remains to construct the submanifolds Vn of [formula] satisfying (1)-(4). We will proceed by induction, constructing Vn as a regular neighborhood of linked θ-graphs; by a θ-graph, we mean a trivalent graph with 2 vertices and without separating edges. To begin, let [formula] be disjoint embedded θ-graphs whose union [formula] is a truly excellent graph, and let V1 be a regular neighborhood of [formula] in [formula]. The θ-graphs X and X' exist by Myers's Theorem.

Suppose that we constructed Vn - 1 and let U  ⊂  Vn - 1 be one of its connected components. By induction, U is a genus 2 handlebody. We are going to construct a disconnected graph LU contained in the interior of U, such that each one of its connected components is a θ-graph of at most diameter 2- n and such that [formula] is truly excellent. Once this graph LU exists, we define Vn as the union of the submanifolds N(LU)  ⊂  U over all connected components U of Vn - 1.

It remains to construct the link L = LU in the genus 2 handlebody U. To start, let X  ⊂  U be a spine of U, i.e., a θ-graph whose complement is a product. We now take a very slim regular neighborhood W of X constructed out of closed topological balls

[formula]

satisfying:

The interiors of all the pieces Ai,Bjl are disjoint.

The intersections [formula] and [formula] are 2-dimensional disks for j = 1,2,3.

[formula] is a 2-dimensional disk for all j = 1,2,3 and [formula].

All other intersections are trivial.

The reader should think of A1,A2 as regular neighborhoods of the two vertices of X and for j = 1,2,3 think of [formula] as a regular neighborhood of an edge of X; compare with Figure [\ref=fig1].

We can clearly choose W in [\eqref=eq-balls] in such a way that each one of the pieces Ai,Bjl has diameter at most 2- (n + 1). We construct L in such a way that each component is contained in the union of two of the pieces of [\eqref=eq-balls]. This yields the desired diameter bound.

Denote by B the collection of pieces Ai,Bjl over all choices of i,j,l, let D be the union of the intersections [formula] with E,F∈B, and for every component D of D choose three distinct points pD1,pD2,pD3 in its interior. Notice that if D is a component of D contained in the boundary ∂E of some E∈B, then [formula] is a π1-injective subsurface of negative Euler characteristic of [formula]. Continuing with the same notation, for each component D of D contained in ∂E choose a properly embedded tripod T(E,D) with endpoints in the punctures of D and assume that [formula] for any two components D,D' of D contained in ∂E. Note that each tripod is half of a θ-graph. See Figure [\ref=fig2]. By Myers's Theorem we can assume that for each E∈B the graph

[formula]

is truly excellent.

Notice that [formula] is a union of θ-graphs, and each of its components is contained in the union of two adjacent E,F∈B. It remains to prove that L is truly excellent in the handlebody U. To see this, notice that [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula], and that, by construction, cutting [formula] along [formula] determines a decomposition satisfying the assumptions of Lemma [\ref=gluing]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=sat1].
