Equivalent representations of higher-order Hamiltonian guiding-center theory

May 24, 2012

Guiding-center theory [\cite=Northrop_63] [\cite=CB_09] is a powerful paradigm for the reduced description of charged-particle dynamics in weakly-nonuniform magnetic fields, which yields a deep understanding of the physics of magnetic confinement in laboratory and space plasmas over long time scales [\cite=White_Chance]. In his pioneering work, Littlejohn [\cite=RGL_83] used Lie-transform perturbation methods [\cite=RGL_82] to derive noncanonical Hamiltonian guiding-center equations of motion that contain first-order corrections associated with the magnetic-field nonuniformity. These first-order corrections not only have theoretical importance in constructing a hierarchy of adiabatic invariants (e.g., [\cite=Northrop_66]) but also play a significant role in ensuring the accuracy of guiding-center numerical codes [\cite=Belova_03] in following magnetically-trapped particles in complex magnetic fields.

The first attempts at keeping second-order corrections in the expressions for the adiabatic invariants appeared in non-Hamiltonian guiding-center equations [\cite=HTH] [\cite=Northrop_Rome]. Hamiltonian guiding-center equations that include second-order corrections (appearing in the guiding-center Hamiltonian) were recently derived by Parra and Calvo [\cite=Parra_Calvo], who pointed out that these higher-order corrections were required in order to construct a consistent Hamiltonian gyrocenter theory [\cite=Brizard_Hahm] that retains all second-order corrections due to magnetic nonuniformity as well as fluctuation amplitude and space-time scales. Because of their potential relevance in numerical gyrokinetic applications [\cite=gyro], a complementary higher-order Hamiltonian guiding-center theory is constructed here, which includes second-order corrections (appearing in the guiding-center Poisson bracket), by using a new perturbative hierarchy in guiding-center theory.

Modern guiding-center Hamiltonian theory [\cite=CB_09] is described in terms of noncanonical guiding-center phase-space coordinates [formula], which include the guiding-center position [formula] and the guiding-center parallel momentum [formula], while the gyro-action [formula] (defined in terms of the magnetic moment μ for a particle of mass m and charge e) is canonically-conjugate to the ignorable gyroangle θ. The guiding-center phase-space coordinates zα are constructed by a near-identity transformation from local particle phase-space coordinates [formula], generated by the phase-space vector fields [formula] (n  =  1,2,...) [\cite=RGL_82]:

[formula]

where the ordering parameter ε appears through the charge renormalization [\cite=Northrop_63] e  →  ε- 1e.

Hamiltonian guiding-center theory [\cite=RGL_83] [\cite=CB_09] is based on the guiding-center phase-space Lagrangian [\cite=RGL_82]

[formula]

where the guiding-center push-forward operator [formula] is generated by [formula] and the gauge-function [formula] is chosen to simplify the form of the guiding-center symplectic one-form Γgc. The local phase-space Lagrangian [formula] in Eq. [\eqref=eq:Lambda_gc] is expressed in terms of the local particle symplectic one-form [formula], with the magnetic field defined as [formula], and the local particle Hamiltonian [formula].

The results of the Lie-transform perturbation analysis [\eqref=eq:Lambda_gc] are summarized as follows [\cite=Brizard_Tronko]. First, the generic form of the guiding-center symplectic one-form is

[formula]

where the vector field [formula] ensures that the one-form [formula] is gyrogauge-invariant [\cite=RGL_83]. In Eq. [\eqref=eq:Gamma_gc_def], the symplectic parallel momentum

[formula]

is defined in terms of the higher-order corrections

[formula]

where [formula] denotes gyroangle averaging, [formula] denotes the lowest-order gyroradius, the first-order operator [formula] is defined for an arbitrary vector field [formula], and we used [formula] for n  ≥  1, where [formula] denotes the magnetic curvature.

Next, the guiding-center Hamiltonian is defined as

[formula]

where the guiding-center ponderomotive potential

[formula]

is defined in terms of the higher-order corrections

[formula]

where we used [formula] in Eq. [\eqref=eq:Psi_1_eq]. In Eqs. [\eqref=eq:Pi_1_eq]-[\eqref=eq:Pi_2_eq] and [\eqref=eq:Psi_1_eq]-[\eqref=eq:Psi_2_eq], the components [formula] are determined from the perpendicular spatial and momentum components of the guiding-center symplectic one-form.

In the perturbation analysis leading to Eqs. [\eqref=eq:Gamma_gc_def] and [\eqref=eq:Ham_gc_def], the generating vector field [formula] is chosen so that the corrections [formula] and Ψn are both independent of the guiding-center gyroangle θ, which yields a guiding-center magnetic-moment adiabatic invariant up to εn + 1. Once the guiding-center phase-space Lagrangian [\eqref=eq:Lambda_gc] has been constructed to any desired order (we now replace e / ε with e), the guiding-center Hamilton equations of motion are expressed in terms of the guiding-center Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq:Ham_gc_def] and the guiding-center Poisson bracket constructed from the guiding-center symplectic one-form [\eqref=eq:Gamma_gc_def]:

[formula]

where the symplectic magnetic field [formula] is

[formula]

with [formula], while the gyrogauge-invariant gradient [formula] is defined with [formula].

The guiding-center equations of motion are now expressed in Hamiltonian form as [formula], where the guiding-center operator dgc / dt is defined in terms of the particle operator d / dt and the guiding-center push-forward and pull-back operators [formula] and [formula] generated by [formula] as

[formula]

The reduced guiding-center equations of motion

[formula]

are decoupled from the gyro-motion equations [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, in contrast to non-Hamiltonian guiding-center equations (e.g., [\cite=Northrop_63]) the reduced guiding-center Hamilton equations [\eqref=eq:gc_x_symp]-[\eqref=eq:gc_p_symp] conserve energy ([formula]) and satisfy the guiding-center Liouville theorem

[formula]

where [formula] is the Jacobian for the guiding-center phase-space transformation [\eqref=eq:gc_trans]. Note that when [formula] and Ψ include nth-order correction terms, the guiding-center Hamilton equations [\eqref=eq:gc_x_symp]-[\eqref=eq:gc_p_symp] contain terms of order n + 1 through [formula] and [formula].

While the reduced guiding-center Hamilton equations [\eqref=eq:gc_x_symp]-[\eqref=eq:gc_p_symp] are completely general and are valid at all orders in ε, they can be simplified if the higher-order corrections are placed either entirely in the guiding-center Poisson bracket or in the guiding-center Hamiltonian. In the former case, called the symplectic representation, the symplectic parallel momentum [\eqref=eq:Pi_def] contains all the higher-order corrections (i.e., [formula] for n  ≥  1), while the ponderomotive potential [\eqref=eq:Psi_def] is simply [formula] (i.e., [formula] for n  ≥  1). In the latter case, called the Hamiltonian representation, the symplectic parallel momentum [formula] replaces [formula] as a dynamical variable (i.e., [formula] for n  ≥  1), while the ponderomotive potential [\eqref=eq:Psi_def] contains the higher-order corrections (i.e., Ψn  ≠  0 for n  ≥  1).

These two complementary representations are generated by two different phase-space transformations [\eqref=eq:gc_trans] leading to the guiding-center coordinates [formula] generated by ([formula]) in the symplectic representation or to the guiding-center coordinates [formula] generated by ([formula]) in the Hamiltonian representation. These representations are said to be equivalent if

[formula]

so that the Jacobian for the guiding-center transformation leading to the Hamiltonian representation is [formula], since [formula]. The representation equivalence [\eqref=eq:equivalent] implies that, for [formula], we have the following relations between generating vector fields

[formula]

while, using Eq. [\eqref=eq:Pi_def], we have

[formula]

The representation-invariance of the magnetic moment [formula] implies that, once the corrections [formula] are found in the symplectic representation, the corrections Ψn are immediately found in the Hamiltonian representation as

[formula]

Hence, once a higher-order Hamiltonian guiding-center theory is derived in one representation, one can also construct a theory in the complementary representation. More importantly, it can also be shown [\cite=Brizard_Tronko] that the guiding-center Hamilton equations [\eqref=eq:gc_x_symp]-[\eqref=eq:gc_p_symp] are identical in all equivalent representations.

We now proceed with the construction of a higher-order Hamiltonian guiding-center theory that retains up to second-order corrections. While it appears that the derivation of the nth-order corrections [formula] and Ψn requires obtaining the guiding-center phase-space transformation [\eqref=eq:gc_trans] up to nth order, we now show that, by introducing the perturbative guiding-center Baños hierarchy in the symplectic representation, we obtain the remarkable fact that the nth-order Hamiltonian structure can be determined from the guiding-center phase-space transformation [\eqref=eq:gc_trans] up to (n - 1)th order only.

The guiding-center Baños hierarchy is constructed in the symplectic representation as follows. Using the functional definition [\eqref=eq:gc_dot_def] for dgc / dt, we introduce the identity

[formula]

expressed in terms of the guiding-center velocity [formula] and the guiding-center displacement velocity dgcgc / dt (which includes the polarization velocity d〈gc〉 / dt). Here, the guiding-center displacement is expanded as

[formula]

where the higher-order corrections

[formula]

satisfy 〈n〉  ≠  0 and n      ≠  0. By taking the dot product of Eq. [\eqref=eq:gc_id] with m   (defined in guiding-center phase space), we obtain the guiding-center Baños hierarchy

[formula]

where we used the identity [formula]. The left side of the guiding-center Baños hierarchy [\eqref=eq:Banos_hierarchy] is expanded in powers of ε as

[formula]

where the gyroangle-averaged first-order correction

[formula]

represents the Baños parallel momentum [\cite=Banos] [\cite=Northrop_Rome], defined in terms of the twist of the magnetic-field lines [formula]. The right side of the guiding-center Baños hierarchy [\eqref=eq:Banos_hierarchy] involves

[formula]

where [formula] and the guiding-center operator [\eqref=eq:gc_dot_def] is expanded as

[formula]

The guiding-center Baños hierarchy [\eqref=eq:Banos_hierarchy] is a perturbative hierarchy that relates [formula] with [formula] at each order n  ≥  1. At first order, the guiding-center Baños hierarchy [\eqref=eq:Banos_hierarchy] yields the gyroangle-averaged relation

[formula]

When it is combined with Eq. [\eqref=eq:Pi_1_eq], with Eq. [\eqref=eq:Banos_first]:

[formula]

we obtain the first-order Baños equation

[formula]

where the unknown [formula] has been eliminated. Integrating Eq. [\eqref=eq:Pi_1_Banos] with respect to [formula] yields the first-order correction

[formula]

This solution means that, since [formula] in the symplectic representation, the first-order Baños parallel momentum J  τ is hidden in the definition of the guiding-center parallel momentum. Note that the first-order symplectic momentum [\eqref=eq:Pi_1] was obtained without knowing the details of the first-order perturbation analysis [\cite=RGL_83] [\cite=CB_09].

At second order, we similarly obtain the second-order Baños equation

[formula]

where [formula] and the scalar field

[formula]

involves terms of second order in magnetic-field nonuniformity. Integrating Eq. [\eqref=eq:Pi2_ave_final] with respect to [formula] yields the second-order correction

[formula]

which is obtained solely from the details of the first-order perturbation analysis [\cite=RGL_83] [\cite=CB_09].

In the symplectic representation (with Ψ  =  μ  B), the guiding-center symplectic parallel momentum is thus

[formula]

so that, up to second order, the guiding-center symplectic one-form is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], while Eq. [\eqref=eq:gc_x_symp] involves the factor

[formula]

where the first-order corrections vanish.

In the Hamiltonian representation (where [formula] acts as a dynamical variable), on the other hand, the equivalence relations [\eqref=eq:psi1_equivalence]-[\eqref=eq:psi2_equivalence] are used to construct the guiding-center ponderomotive potential

[formula]

All second-order terms in Eq. [\eqref=eq:Psi_Ham] appear in Eq. (135) of Parra and Calvo [\cite=Parra_Calvo]. However, since they use a mixed representation (i.e., [formula] and Ψ2  ≠  0), which may not be equivalent to ours, there are additional terms as well (which do not satisfy the Baños hierarchy).

In summary, we have presented two equivalent representations of higher-order Hamiltonian guiding-center theory that retains second-order corrections and satisfies the perturbative Baños hierarchy [\eqref=eq:Banos_hierarchy] derived from the guiding-center identity [\eqref=eq:gc_id]. These representations yield identical Hamilton guiding-center equations, which can be used to construct a consistent Hamiltonian gyrocenter theory used to study the long-time magnetic confinement of charged particles in the presence of electromagnetic fluctuations.
