: Hyperplane arrangement; Shi arrangement; Free arrangement; Derivations

Introduction

Let E be an [formula]-dimensional real Euclidean space. Let Φ be an irreducible root system and Φ+ denote the set of positive roots of Φ. The Weyl arrangement of the type Φ is denoted by A(Φ):

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then the Shi arrangement is given by

[formula]

Embed the [formula]-dimensional space E into [formula] by adding a new coordinate z such that E is defined by the equation z = 1 in V. Then, as in [\cite=OT], we have the cone S(Φ) over the Shi arrangement. It is a central arrangement in V defined by

[formula]

Let S be the algebra of polynomial functions on V and let [formula] be the module of derivations of S to itself

[formula]

The derivation module D(S(Φ)) is defined by

[formula]

We say that S(Φ) is free if D(S(Φ)) is a free S-module.

Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis for the dual space E*. In this paper we explicitly choose root systems ΦB and ΦC, and positive root systems ΦB+ and ΦC+ of the types [formula] and [formula] respectively as follows:

[formula]

We express the cones over the Shi arrangements of the types [formula] and [formula] by [formula] and [formula] respectively.

In the study of the Kazhdan-Lusztig representation theory of the affine Weyl groups, J.-Y. Shi introduced the Shi arrangements for the type [formula] in [\cite=shi1]. Later a good number of articles, including [\cite=Ath] [\cite=ER] [\cite=Hea] [\cite=St96] [\cite=Y04], study the Shi arrangements. M. Yoshinaga proved in [\cite=Y04] that the cone over the Shi arrangement is a free arrangement by settling the Edelman-Reiner conjecture in [\cite=ER] which asserts that the generalized Shi and Catalan arrangements are free. However, even in the case of the cone over the Shi arrangement of the type [formula], no basis was constructed explicitly at that time. Recently a basis for the cone over the Shi arrangement of the type [formula] is constructed explicitly in [\cite=Sute] and of the type [formula] in [\cite=Gao]. In those papers the most important ingredients of their recipes are the Bernoulli polynomials Bk(x) and their relatives Br,s(x). In the present paper, we construct bases for the cones over the Shi arrangements of the types [formula] and [formula] by using new Bernoulli-like polynomials BBr,s(x) and BCr,s(x).

The organization of this paper is as follows: in Section 2, we will construct [formula] derivations [formula] belonging to [formula]. In Section 3, we will prove that they, together with the Euler derivation, form a basis of [formula]. In Section 4, we present a similar construction of a basis for [formula] for the type [formula].

A basis construction for the type [formula]

Note that [formula] is a polynomial either of degree r - 1 (when r is odd) or of degree r - 2 (when r is even). It is thus easy to see that BBr,s(x) uniquely exists and

[formula]

BBr,s(x) is an odd function.

Replacing x with - x - 1 in [\ref=defBofB] (i), we have

[formula]

Then we get F(x)  =  F(x + 1) where F(x): = BBr,s(x) + BBr,s( - x). Thus we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let [formula]. Define

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in [formula] of degree k. Then define

[formula]

It is easy to see that each φBj is homogeneous derivation of degree [formula] which is equal to the Coxeter number for [formula]. We will prove that the derivations θE and [formula] form a basis for [formula]. First we will verify the following

Let ε∈{ - 1,0,1}. Then we have the following congruence relations:

[formula]

[formula]

The first congruence follows from Definition [\ref=defBofB] and Lemma [\ref=oddfunctionB]. Let the congruent notation [formula] in the following calculation be modulo the ideal (xp  +  εxq - z). By Definition [\ref=defBofB] and Lemma [\ref=oddfunctionB], we have

[formula]

The derivations [formula] belong to the module [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=modeqB], we first have

[formula]

for [formula]. Thus we conclude that φBj(xp),φBj(xp  ±  xq) are divisible by xp,xp  ±  xq for [formula] respectively.

Let the congruent notation [formula] in the following calculation be modulo the ideal (xp  +  εxq - z). By Proposition [\ref=modeqB], for [formula], we also have

[formula]

Here,

[formula]

and

[formula]

If 1  ≤  p  ≤  j - 1, then

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

for all pairs (p,q) with [formula] and ε∈{ - 1,0,1}. Hence [formula] for [formula].

The W-equivariance

Recall that A(Φ) is the Weyl arrangement in E corresponding to the irreducible root system Φ. Then we may identify

[formula]

with the algebra of polynomial functions on E. In [\cite=ST98] L. Solomon and H. Terao studied the [formula]-module

[formula]

which was denoted by E(A) in [\cite=ST98]. Let h be the Coxeter number for Φ. Define

[formula]

which is a real vector space. Note that the Weyl group W corresponding to Φ naturally acts on D(A(Φ),2) and D(A(Φ),2)h. We also define an S-submodule

[formula]

of D(S(Φ)). Then D(S(Φ)) has a decomposition

[formula]

over S. Let

[formula]

which is a real vector space. If φ∈D0(S(Φ)), then φ(αH)∈αH(αH - z)S for any H∈A(Φ). Let [formula] be the restriction of φ to z = 0. Then [formula] for any H∈A(Φ), hence [formula].

(1) (L. Solomon-H. Terao[\cite=ST98]) The [formula]-module D(A(Φ),2) is a free module with a basis consisting of [formula] derivations homogeneous of degree h. In other words, we have an isomorphism

[formula]

(2) (M. Yoshinaga[\cite=Y04]) The S-module D0(S(Φ)) is a free module with a basis consisting of [formula] derivations homogeneous of degree h. In other words, we have an isomorphism

[formula]

Also the restriction map

[formula]

defined by [formula] is a linear isomorphism.

Suppose that Φ is of the type [formula] in the rest of this section. Then we may define an explicit [formula]-linear map

[formula]

by

[formula]

using the derivations [formula] in Definition [\ref=basisdefinition].

Let Φ be a root system of the type [formula].

(1) The map

[formula]

defined by [formula] is a W-equivariant isomorphism.

(2) The map

[formula]

is a linear isomorphism.

(1) Since

[formula]

[formula]

Thus we obtain

[formula]

Since

[formula]

is a W-invariant derivation and the correspondence

[formula]

is W-equivariant for every [formula], we conclude that Ξ is W-equivariant. Therefore Ξ is bijective by Schur's lemma.

(2) follows from (1) because the restriction map ρ is bijective by Theorem [\ref=Wequivariance] (2).

The derivations [formula] form a basis for [formula].

It is enough to show that [formula] form a basis for [formula]. Recall that each Ψ(xj)  =  φBj belongs to [formula]. Theorems [\ref=Wequivariance] (2) and [\ref=unique] (2) complete the proof.

A basis construction for the type [formula]

It is easy to see that BCr,s(x) uniquely exists and

[formula]

The following lemma can be proved by a smilar argument to the proof of Lemma [\ref=oddfunctionB]:

BCr,s(x) is an odd function.

Note that φCj is exactly the same as φBj with only one exception: the use of BCr,s(xi,z) instead of BBr,s(xi,z). Thus each φBj is homogeneous derivation of degree [formula] which is equal to the Coxeter number for [formula]. We will prove that the derivations θE and [formula] form a basis for [formula]. We first have the following Proposition:

Let ε∈{ - 1,0,1}. Then we have the following conguruence relations:

[formula]

[formula]

Imitate the proof of Proposition [\ref=modeqB].

The derivations [formula] belong to the module [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=modeqC], we first have

[formula]

for [formula]. Thus we conclude that φCj(2xp),φCj(xp  ±  xq) are divisible by 2xp,xp  ±  xq for [formula] respectively.

Let the congruent notation [formula] in the following calculation be modulo the ideal (xp  +  εxq - z). By Proposition [\ref=modeqC], for [formula], we also have

[formula]

[formula]

Here,

[formula]

and

[formula]

If 1  ≤  p  ≤  j - 1, then

[formula]

If [formula] and ε∈{ - 1,1}, then

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

for all pairs (p,q) with [formula] where ε∈{ - 1,1}. When p = q,ε = 1,

[formula]

for [formula]. Hence [formula] for [formula].

We may define an explicit [formula]-linear map

[formula]

by

[formula]

using the derivations [formula] in Definition [\ref=basisdefinitionC].

Let Φ be a root system of the type [formula].

(1) The map

[formula]

defined by [formula] is a W-equivariant isomorphism.

(2) The map

[formula]

is a linear isomorphism.

Since

[formula]

we may prove this theorem in the same way as Theorem [\ref=unique].

The derivations [formula] form a basis for [formula].

Apply Theorems [\ref=uniqueC] (2) and and [\ref=Wequivariance] (2) in the same way as the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainB].

Since the W-equivariant isomorphism [formula] in Theorem [\ref=unique] (1) is unique up to a nonzero constant multiple by Schur's lemma, the derivations [formula] coincide with the Solomon-Terao basis in [\cite=ST98] up to a nonzero constant multiple. Therefore, our construction of [formula] can be regarded as an explicit realization of the basis existence theorem by M. Yoshinaga in [\cite=Y04]. This is also true for the type [formula].
