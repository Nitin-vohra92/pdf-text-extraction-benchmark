Let us start with the system of equations obtained after separation of the bariables in Duffin-Kemmer equation for a spin 1 field in quasi-cartesian coordinates of the Lobachevsky space [\cite=1]

[formula]

10 equations are

When performing nonrelativistic approximation in (1) we will adhere the method elaborated in [\cite=2] [\cite=3].

First, with the help of (1a) and (1d) let us exclude non-dynamical variables Φ0,H1,H2,H3 in eqs. (1b),  (1c) (components that were not differentiated in time)

[formula]

which results in

In the system (2), let us introduce big and small components, Ψj and ψj:

[formula]

eqs. (2) take the form

Within each pair of equations, let us sum and subtract two equations

Next step is to separate the rest energy

[formula]

to this end it is enough in eqs. (4) to perform one formal change ε on (M + E):

Conditions of non-relativity reduce to two restrictions:

[formula]

Taking into account (6), from (5) one can derive three equations for big components Ψj (also there arise expressions for small components in terms of big ones). Below we write down only three equations for big components

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

These are what we need: the system of equations in Pauli approximation.

Let us consider how these equations behave when vanishing curvature. To this end, it is better to translate (7) to usual units

[formula]

[formula]

For instance, the first equation takes the form

[formula]

[formula]

at vanishing curvature, ρ  →    ∞  , it reduces to

[formula]

Similarly, one can consider two remaining equations - so we get

[formula]

[formula]

Equations (8) coincide with those arising when examining the same problem in Minkowski space

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note that the most simple solutions for equations (9) in Minkowski space taken according to

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

do not provide us with eigenstates of helicity operator for spin 1 field.

To construct solutions for system (7) in Lobachevsky space, below we will use additional operator, generalized helicity operator Σ. Definition and main properties of that were given in [\cite=1]. In nonrelativistic limit, the eigenvalue equation ΣΨ  =  σΨ leads to tree relations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Depending on values of σ (zero or non-zero) we have substantially different constrains in (10).

First, let us examine the case σ  ≠  0 (from general consideration it is evident that in the nonrelativistic limit the following relation must hold: [formula])

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Because σ  ≠  0, with the help of second relation one can exclude the function Ψ2

[formula]

in the first and the third equations, thus obtaining the system for only two functions

[formula]

[formula]

Let us find an a second order equation for Ψ1:

[formula]

[formula]

or

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and further

[formula]

[formula]

From whence, after evident simplifying awe arrive at

[formula]

that is

[formula]

Similarly, equation for Ψ3 is

[formula]

Remembering, that Ψ1,  Ψ3 (12a,b) are not independent, instead they are connected by the first order differential system (11c). Moreover, relation (11b) permits us to construct explicitly Ψ2 in terms of the known Ψ1,  Ψ3. which provides us with the complete solving of the problem.

In order to detail the problem, let us translate eqs. (12a) and (12b) to a new variable

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Through the substitutions

[formula]

eqs. (13a) reduce to the Bessel form

[formula]

[formula]

with the following solutions (let it be: ν  =  1  -  iσ,  μ  =  1  +  iσ)

[formula]

[formula]

We wish to know pairs of solutions in (13c) that are linked by the first order relations (11c). To clarify that let us translate eqs. (11c) to the above variable x:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

by substitutions they reduce to

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is easily to simplify the formulas by the following notation

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let us demonstrate that one possible solution is realized on the functions

[formula]

[formula]

To this end, it it suffices to apply the first equation

[formula]

With the help of the known relation for Bessel functions

[formula]

it can be translated to the form

[formula]

From whence, allowing for the known recursive relation

[formula]

we get an identity 0 = 0.

Thus, we have constructed the firs class of solutions

[formula],

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly, we can prove existent of the second class of solutions

[formula],

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now let us turn to the case of σ = 0, it is specified by the following relations (see (1))

[formula]

Allowing for (13) in (7), we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The second relation in (16) says that Ψ2 can be found on the base of the known Ψ1. In fact, this gives the complete solving of the problem when σ = 0.

Note that equations for Ψ1 and Ψ3 are the same. Let us translate eq. (17a,b) to the new variable

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By substitution Ψ1  =  x2  g1  (x) it reduces to the the Bessel type

[formula]

Thus, at σ = 0 there are constructed solutions of two types:

σ = 0,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It remains to prove that eq. (17c) is consistent with (16) and (17a,b). To this end, it is convenient to introduce new functions

[formula]

then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let us substitute the expression for 2 (19b) into eq. (19d):

[formula]

Allowing for the following relation

[formula]

we translate it to the form

[formula]

which is an identity.

Thus, the problem of solving the Duffin-Kemmer equation for spin 1 particle on the background of Lobachevsky space in Pauli approximation is completed. A basis based on the four operators

[formula]

is constructed. Ultimately, the problem ends with a second order differential equation of Schrödinger type with a barrier of special form that generates a reflection coefficient R = 1 for all states - for more detail see in [\cite=5].
