Abstract. We prove two conjectures of Brändén on the real-rootedness of polynomials Qn(x) and Rn(x) which are related to the Boros-Moll polynomials Pn(x). In fact, we show that both Qn(x) and Rn(x) form Sturm sequences. The first conjecture implies the 2-log-concavity of Pn(x), and the second conjecture implies the 3-log-concavity of Pn(x).

Introduction

In this paper, we prove two conjectures of Brändén [\cite=Bran2011] concerning the Boros-Moll polynomials. Brändén introduced two polynomials based on the coefficients of the Boros-Moll polynomials and conjectured that these polynomials have only real roots. As pointed out by Brändén, the first conjecture implies the 2-fold log-concavity, or 2-log-concavity, for short, of the Boros-Moll polynomials, whereas the second conjecture implies the 3-log-concavity.

Let us start with some definitions. Given a finite nonnegative sequence {ai}ni = 0, we say that it is unimodal if there exists an integer m  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

and we say that it is log-concave if

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. Define L to be an operator acting on the sequence {ai}ni = 0 as given by

[formula]

where bi = a2i - ai + 1ai - 1 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n under the convention that a- 1 = 0 and an + 1 = 0. Clearly, the sequence {ai}ni = 0 is log-concave if and only if the sequence {bi}ni = 0 is nonnegative. Given a sequence {ai}ni = 0, we say that it is k-fold log-concave, or k-log-concave, if Lj({ai}ni = 0) is a nonnegative sequence for any 1  ≤  j  ≤  k. A sequence {ai}ni = 0 is said to be infinitely log-concave if it is k-log-concave for all k  ≥  1. Given a polynomial

[formula]

we say that f(x) is log-concave (or k-log-concave, or infinitely log-concave) if the sequence {ai}ni = 0 of coefficients is log-concave (resp., k-log-concave, infinitely log-concave).

The notion of infinite log-concavity was introduced by Boros and Moll [\cite=Bormol2004] in their study of the following quartic integral

[formula]

For any x >  - 1 and any nonnegative integer n, they obtained the following formula,

[formula]

where

[formula]

are the Boros-Moll polynomials. Using Ramanujan's Master Theorem, they derived an alternative representation of Pn(x),

[formula]

Write

[formula]

We call {di(n)}ni = 0 a Boros-Moll sequence. Boros and Moll proposed the following conjecture.

The sequence {di(n)}ni = 0 is infinitely log-concave.

The log-concavity of {di(n)}ni = 0 was conjectured by Moll [\cite=moll2002], and it was proved by Kauers and Paule [\cite=KauPau2007] by establishing recurrence relations of the coefficients di(n). Chen and Xia [\cite=chenxia08] showed that the polynomials Pn(x) are ratio monotone. Notice that for a positive sequence, the ratio monotone property implies both log-concavity and the spiral property. It is worth mentioning that there are proofs of the log-concavity without using recurrence relations. Llamas and Martínez-Bernal [\cite=llamab2010] proved that if f(x) is a polynomial with nondecreasing and nonnegative coefficients, then f(x + 1) is log-concave. Furthermore, Chen, Yang and Zhou [\cite=chyazh2010] proved that if f(x) is a polynomial with nondecreasing and nonnegative coefficients, then f(x + 1) is ratio monotone. From ([\ref=eq-bm]) it is easily seen that the coefficients of Pn(x - 1) are nondecreasing and nonnegative. Hence Pn(x) are log-concave and ratio monotone. A combinatorial interpretation of the log-concavity of Pn(x) has been found by Chen, Pang and Qu [\cite=cpq2012].

There was little progress on the higher-fold log-concavity of the Boros-Moll polynomials. As remarked by Kauers and Paule [\cite=KauPau2007], it seems that there is little hope to prove the 2-log-concavity of {di(n)}ni = 0 using recurrence relations. By constructing an intermediate function, Chen and Xia [\cite=Chx2010] proved the 2-log-concavity of Pn(x) by applying recurrence relations. Based on a technique of McNamara and Sagan [\cite=mcnsag2010], Kauers verified the infinite log-concavity of Pn(x) for n  ≤  129.

Brändén [\cite=Bran2011] presented an approach to Conjecture [\ref=boros-moll-conj] by relating higher-order log-concavity to real-rooted polynomials. Boros and Moll [\cite=Bormol2004] conjectured that for any nonnegative integer n the sequence [formula] is infinitely log-concave. Fisk [\cite=fisk2008], McNamara and Sagan [\cite=mcnsag2010] and Stanley independently made the following conjecture which implies the conjecture of Boros and Moll. This conjecture has been proved by Brändén [\cite=Bran2011].

Brändén's proof is based on a symmetric function identity and the Grace-Walsh-Szegö theorem concerning the location of zeros of multi-affine and symmetric polynomials. Moreover, Brändén obtained a general result about the characterization of nonlinear transformations preserving real-rootedness, in the spirit of the characterization of linear transformations preserving stability given by Borcea and Brändén [\cite=borbra2009]. Cardon and Nielsen [\cite=carnie2011] found a combinatorial proof of Theorem [\ref=bran-thm] in terms of directed acyclic weighted planar networks. Although the Boros-Moll polynomials Pn(x) are not real-rooted, Brändén [\cite=Bran2011] introduced two polynomials related to Pn(x), and conjectured that they are real-rooted.

For any n  ≥  1, the polynomial

[formula]

has only real zeros.

For any n  ≥  1, the polynomial

[formula]

has only real zeros.

As pointed out by Brändén [\cite=Bran2011], the real-rootedness of Qn(x) implies the 2-log-concavity of Pn(x), and the real-rootedness of Rn(x) implies the 3-log-concavity of Pn(x). It is worth mentioning that Csordas [\cite=csordas2011] proved the real-rootedness of some polynomials related to Qn(x). In this paper, we shall prove the above conjectures.

Proofs of Brändén's Conjectures

To prove Brändén's conjectures, we shall show that the polynomials Qn(x) and Rn(x) form Sturm sequences. Let us recall a criterion of Liu and Wang [\cite=liu-wang] which can be used to deduce that a polynomial sequence is a Sturm sequence.

Throughout this paper, we shall be concerned with polynomials with real coefficients. We say that a polynomial is standard if it is zero or its leading coefficient is positive. Let [formula] denote the set of polynomials with only real zeros. Suppose that [formula] is a polynomial of degree n with zeros {rk}nk = 1, and [formula] is a polynomial of degree m with zeros {sk}mk = 1. We say that g(x) interlaces f(x) if n = m + 1 and

[formula]

and we say that g(x) strictly interlaces f(x) if, in addition, they have no common zeros. We use [formula] to denote that g(x) interlaces f(x), and use [formula] to denote that g(x) strictly interlaces f(x). For any real numbers a,b and c, we assume that [formula] and [formula]. A sequence {fn(x)}n  ≥  0 of standard polynomials is said to be a Sturm sequence if, for n  ≥  0, we have deg fn(x) = n and

[formula]

Liu and Wang [\cite=liu-wang] gave a sufficient condition for a polynomial sequence {fn(x)}n  ≥  0 to form an interlacing sequence.

To prove Conjectures [\ref=conjecture1] and [\ref=conjecture2], we proceed to derive recurrence relations for Qn(x) and Rn(x) based on the recurrence relations of the coefficients di(n) of the Boros-Moll polynomials Pn(x). Kauers and Paule [\cite=KauPau2007] proved that

[formula]

In fact, [\eqref=rec1] can be easily derived from [\eqref=rec2]. Note that Moll [\cite=moll2007] independently derived the relation [\eqref=rec2] via the WZ-method.

Proof. For n  ≥  1, relation [\eqref=eq-rec-qm] can be rewritten as

[formula]

where 0  ≤  i  ≤  n + 1. From [\eqref=rec1] it follows that

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=eq-new] into [\eqref=eq-inter-q], we get

[formula]

It is easily checked that the above relation ([\ref=eq-inter]) coincides with [\eqref=rec2] with n replaced by n - 1. This completes the proof.

Using the above recurrence relation and the criterion of Liu and Wang, we can deduce that the polynomials Qn(x) form a Sturm sequence. This leads to an affirmative answer to Conjecture [\ref=conjecture1].

Proof. Clearly, we have deg (Qn(x)) = n. It suffices to prove that [formula] and [formula] for any n  ≥  0. We use induction on n. By convention,

[formula]

Assume that

[formula]

We proceed to verify that

[formula]

We see that the recurrence relation [\eqref=eq-rec-qm] of Qn(x) is of the form [\eqref=eq-pol] in Theorem [\ref=liuwangthm2], where the polynomials an(x),bn(x),cn(x) are given by

[formula]

For n  ≥  1 and x  ≤  0, one can check that

[formula]

In view of Theorem [\ref=liuwangthm2], we find that [formula] and [formula]. This completes the proof.

The following recurrence relation for Rn(x) can be proved in a way similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=rec-qm].

Using the above recurrence relation, we obtain the following theorem, which leads to an affirmative answer to Conjecture [\ref=conjecture2].

Proof. The proof is analogous to that of Theorem [\ref=thm-1]. It is routine to verify that

[formula]

It remains to show that [formula] and [formula] for n  ≥  3. We use induction n. Assume that

[formula]

We wish to prove that

[formula]

The recurrence relation [\eqref=eq-rec-rm] of Rn(x) is of the form [\eqref=eq-pol] in Theorem [\ref=liuwangthm2], and the polynomials an(x),bn(x),cn(x) are given by

[formula]

For n  ≥  3 and x  ≤  0, we find that

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=liuwangthm2], we conclude that [formula] and [formula]. This completes the proof.
