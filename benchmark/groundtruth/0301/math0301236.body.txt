Geometry of differential operators, and odd Laplace operators

Let Δ be an arbitrary linear differential operator of the second order acting on functions on a (super)manifold M. In local coordinates [formula]. The principal symbol of Δ is the symmetric tensor field Sab, or the quadratic function [formula] on T*M. The principal symbol can be understood as a symmetric "bracket" on functions: [formula], where ε  =   is the parity of the operator Δ; in coordinates [formula]. In the following by a bracket in a commutative algebra we mean an arbitrary symmetric bi-derivation. The problem is to describe all operators Δ with a given Sab, or, which is the same, all operators generating a given bracket {f,g}. Without loss of generality we set R = Δ(1): = 1 in the sequel. Initially we suppose that the operators act on scalar functions; operator pencils acting on densities of arbitrary weights will naturally appear in the course of study. Everything is applicable to supermanifolds as well as to usual manifolds. For odd operators in the super case questions about identities of the Jacobi type arise. The problem is closely related with the geometry of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism in quantum field theory (description of the "generating operators" for an odd bracket).

The first non-trivial observation is that Hörmander's subprincipal symbol [formula] can be interpreted as an "upper connection" in the bundle [formula]. Precisely, [formula] has the transformation law [formula], where [formula] (the Jacobian), and it specifies a "contravariant derivative" [formula] on volume forms. The coordinate-dependent Hamiltonian [formula] plays the role of a local connection form. If the matrix Sab is invertible, then we can lower the index a and get a usual connection. (Let us stress that Δ acts on functions, and a priori there is no extra structure on our manifold. The bundle [formula] and an upper connection in it arise from the operator itself.) Thus, Δ is defined by a set of data: a bracket on functions and an associated upper connection in [formula].

Define the algebra of densities [formula] as the algebra of formal linear combinations of densities of arbitrary weights [formula]. In [formula] there is a unit 1 and a natural invariant scalar multiplication. The scalar product is given by the formula: [formula]. We specify elements of [formula] by generating functions [formula] defined on a manifold [formula]. One can classify the derivations of [formula] [\cite=tv:laplace2]. A bracket of weight 0 in [formula] is specified by a tensor [formula] on [formula], where Sab gives a bracket on M, γa gives an upper connection in [formula] associated with Sab, and the term θ is a second order geometric object (depending on Sab and γa), similar to the Brans-Dicke field in Kaluza-Klein type theories. A set of data Sab,γa,θ is equivalent (non-canonically) to a set consisting of Sab, a vector field and a scalar. Operators in the algebra [formula] are written as operator pencils Δw acting on w-densities. A pencil Δw is self-adjoint if (Δw)*  =  Δ1 - w. A second order differential operator in [formula] is represented by a quadratic pencil Δw  =  Δ0 + wA + w2B, where Δ0 is a second order operator on functions, A and B having orders [formula] and 0.

For the algebra [formula] there is a one-to-one correspondence between brackets and second order operators with the self-adjointness condition. To a bracket with the matrix Ŝâ corresponds a "canonical pencil" [formula]

The corresponding operator in the algebra [formula] is the Laplacian constructed from Ŝâ and the canonical divergence on [formula]  [\cite=tv:laplace2]. There is a unique canonical pencil passing through an operator on w0-densities with a given "non-singular" weight [formula]. A pencil can be recovered from an operator on functions up to w(w - 1)f, where f is a scalar.

Consider odd operators. To them correspond odd brackets. Notice that an odd symmetric bracket is transformed into an even antisymmetric bracket by the parity shift. If Δ is odd and [formula], then [formula]. The condition [formula] is equivalent to the Jacobi identity for the bracket generated by Δ. In this case D = (S,_) is a differential in C∞(T*M), and for an upper connection γ  =  γapa the notion of curvature makes sense: F = Dγ.

An operator Δ is a derivation of the generated bracket (equivalently, [formula]) if and only if Dγ = 0.

The flatness of γ is "subsumed" by the Jacobi identity for a bracket in [formula]:

The Jacobi identity for an odd bracket in [formula] is equivalent to the equations (S,S) = 0, (S,γ) = 0, (S,θ) + (γ,γ) = 0, (γ,θ) = 0. (In such case also Δ2w  =  LX for some [formula], which is automatically Poisson.)

The condition Δ2 = 0 in the odd symplectic case gives the Batalin-Vilkovisky equation for an action [formula]. In the general odd Poisson case the "Batalin-Vilkovisky equations" are written for a pair of flat connections and possess a groupoid property. They describe a change of the operator Δ2 on functions or Δ on half-densities [\cite=tv:laplace1] [\cite=tv:laplace2].

The theory can be generalized for operators and brackets of nonzero weight. It is interesting to consider a generalization for operators of higher order (where homotopy algebras should appear).
