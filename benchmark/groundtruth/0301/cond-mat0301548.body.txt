RKKY interaction in framework of T = 0 Green function method

The RKKY interaction is a basic ingredient in the physics of magnetism, see for example the textbook by Mattis [\cite=Mattis]. The purpose of the present paper is purely methodical: to derive RKKY result using the Green function technique for T = 0. The diagram formalism is described in the monograph by Lifshitz and Pitaevski [\cite=Lifshitz9] or the monograph by Abrikosov, Gor'kov and Dzyaloshinski [\cite=Abrikosov]. The s-d exchange interaction

[formula]

is treated as a small perturbation. Where [formula] and [formula] are the space-vectors of the impurities, [formula] and [formula] are their spins, and [formula] and [formula] are electron spin operators in the corresponding space points. Using the simple matrix equation

[formula]

and the general rules for single loop approximation we obtain the space dependence of the indirect exchange

[formula]

where

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fermi energy and F is the Fermi momentum. This integral is actually the Fourier transformation of the polarization operator of 3 dimensional electron gas for zero frequency. For a complementary Green function derivation of the polarizability of degenerate electron gas see the recent preprint [\cite=plasmons].

For simplification of further notation we introduce the constant which parameterize the electron scattering rate q2 = 2m*  /  τ. Using the elementary relation

[formula]

the integral above can be presented as

[formula]

In order to solve these integrals we introduce spherical coordinates in momentum spaces

[formula]

[formula]

One can easily check that due to the symmetry of integrant the integration on k' can be expanded to k' < kF. Then

[formula]

And using

[formula]

we find that

[formula]

Analogously

[formula]

and

[formula]

we get

[formula]

In order to calculate the last integral we will apply the residuum theorem for the function

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

we suppose that function f has simple poles. The contour contains the real axe and infinite arch in upper semiplane; [formula] The arch gives zero part when it radius goes to infinity and the real axe integral just presented by the residuum

[formula]

The poles of f(z) obeys the equation

[formula]

which has the solutions

[formula]

Only z = z2 belongs to upper semiplane and its residuum is

[formula]

In weak scattering limit

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the same weak scattering limit

[formula]

where λ  =  Fτ / m* is the electron mean free path, we have

[formula]

The elementary integration gives

[formula]

And for the second integral we obtain

[formula]

Finally for the exchange integral we arrive at

[formula]

Comparing with other explanations we come to the conclusion that the method of T = 0 Green functions give a standard and probably simplest explanation of the RKKY interaction in metallic alloys. A derivation directly based on the methods of statistical mechanics. If we used temperature Green functions applied to T  →  0 we would arrive at the the same residuum.
