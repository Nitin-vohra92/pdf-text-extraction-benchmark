Representability of F and F

MSC2000: 14A25

Statement of results

Let X be a scheme and F a quasi-coherent OX-module of finite presentation. We are interested in the representability of the following two functors on the category of X-schemes:

[formula]

for f:X'  →  X an X-scheme.

The result is as follows:

Let X be a scheme and F a quasi-coherent OX-module of finite presentation. Then the following are equivalent:

F is locally free.

F is representable by a scheme.

F is representable by a scheme.

If X is locally noetherian, these conditions are also equivalent to the following:

F is representable by an algebraic space.

F is representable by an algebraic space.

The equivalence of 1) and 2) in theorem [\ref=thm11] in case X is noetherian is the main result of [\cite=N]. Our proof follows the ideas of loc.cit. closely. The main steps are contained in the following two lemmas:

Let A be a local ring and M a finitely presented A-module which is not free. Then there is a local homomorphism A  →  B such that

[formula]

for some 0  ≠  b∈B,b2  =  0 and m  ≥  1,n  ≥  0. If A is noetherian, B can be chosen to be artin.

We observe that in the last statement of the lemma the noetherian hypothesis is indispensable: let [formula] be a local ring such that there is [formula]. Clearly [formula], so after dividing out (b2) one gets a ring B as in the lemma but for any local homomorphism f:B  →  C with C noetherian one clearly has f(b)  =  0.

Let S be a scheme and S0  ⊆  S a closed subscheme defined by a nilpotent ideal sheaf. Assume X is a flat S-scheme and f:X  →  Y is an S-morphism such that [formula] is an isomorphism. Then f is an isomorphism.

In order to treat the representability of F we will use the following observation:

Under the assumptions of 1.1 the obvious natural transformation of (set-valued) functors F  →  F is relatively representable by an open immersion.

For completeness we also include a proof of the next lemma which is essentially lemma 5 of [\cite=N] and shows the relative representability of a "parabolic" sub-group functor: Let X be a scheme and

[formula]

a short exact sequence of quasi-coherent OX-modules with F' finitely presented and F'' locally free. For any morphism f:Y  →  X, the sequence f*(()) is exact because F'' is in particular OX-flat and it makes sense to consider

[formula]

In the above situation, the natural transformation [formula] is relatively representable by a closed immersion.

For basic facts about (relative) representability we refer to [\cite=BLR], 7.6.

Proofs

In this subsection we dispense with the easy implications of theorem [\ref=thm11], the assumptions and notations of which we now assume: As F and F are clearly Zariski sheaves the problem of representing them is Zariski local on X, i.e. we can assume that X is affine and F corresponds to a free module of finite rank. In this case, representability of both F and F is obvious; we have proved the implications 1) ⇒   2) and 1) ⇒   2'). Finally, the implications 2) ⇒   3) and 2') ⇒   3') are trivial.

Proof of lemma [\ref=t1]: Let [formula] be a local ring and M a finitely presented A-module which is not free. We will find the required local homomorphism A  →  B as a suitable quotient of A: Let

[formula]

be a minimal presentation of M, i.e. [formula] where [formula] is the residue field of A. Then M is free if and only if α  =  0: clearly α  =  0 is sufficient for freeness of M and conversely, if M is free, it is necessarily so of rank n, hence β is a surjective endomorphism of An which must be an isomorphism by a standard application of Nakayama's lemma, c.f. [\cite=M], thm. 2.4., hence α  =  0. For any [formula], ([\ref=eq:2]) [formula] is a minimal presentation of the A  /  J-module M  /  JM. If we denote by I  ⊆  A the ideal generated by the coefficients of any matrix representation of α and note that the minimality of ([\ref=eq:2]) implies [formula] we find that M  /  JM is A  /  J-free if and only if [formula] if and only if I  ⊆  J. As M is not A-free we have I  ≠  0 and as I is finitely generated we get [formula], again by Nakayama's lemma. By Zorn's lemma, using again that I is finitely generated, there is an ideal J with [formula] and which is maximal subject to these conditions (indeed, any ascending chain of such ideals admits its union as an upper bound because I is finitely generated).

We claim that B: = A  /  J is as required: By the maximality of J the ideal [formula] is non-zero principal: [formula] and we neccessarily have b2  =  0: if not, we would have b∈(b2), i.e. b  =  xb2 or b(1 - xb)  =  0 for some x∈B. As [formula], the maximal ideal of B,1 - xb was a unit of B, so we would have b  =  0.

We now show that [formula] has the desired structure: any coefficient αij of a matrix representation of [formula] is of the form αij  =  buij,uij∈B. As by construction [formula] we see that if αij  ≠  0, then uij∈B*. We get a matrix equation (αij)  =  b(uij) and (uij) can be chosen with uij  =  0 or uij∈B*, all i,j. Then the usual Gauß-algorithm can be applied to (uij), showing that indeed [formula] for some m,n  ≥  0. As, by construction, [formula] is not B-free, we finally see that m  ≥  1.

If A is noetherian we can start the construction of B by first dividing out a suitable high power of [formula]: Indeed, if [formula] was free for all n  ≥  1 we would have [formula]. Then the ring B we obtain in the above construction is noetherian local with [formula] nilpotent, hence zero-dimensional, i.e. B is artin local.

Proof of lemma [\ref=t2]: We can assume that the ideal sheaf I of S0  ⊆  S satisfies I2  =  0. Our assertion is local on S,X and Y and thus reduces to the following: Given a ring k and an ideal I  ⊆  k of square zero, if f:A  →  B is a morphism of k-algebras with B k-flat and such that [formula] is an isomorphism, then f is an isomorphism: 1) f is surjective: any b∈B can be written

[formula]

Applying this to the b'j we get (for some αij∈I,b''ij∈B,aj∈A):

[formula]

2) f is injective: For K: = ker(f) the k-flatness of B implies K  /  IK  =  0 and the same argument as in 1) shows that K  =  0.

Proof of 2) ⇒   1) in theorem [\ref=thm11]: Under the notations of [\ref=s11] we assume that F is representable by a scheme and, by contradiction, that F is not locally free. Note that the assumption on representability is stable under base-change Y  →  X. So, base-changing to a suitable local ring of X, we can assume [formula] with A local and F corresponding to a finitely presented A-module M which is not free. According to lemma [\ref=t1] we can assume [formula] for some 0  ≠  a∈A with a2  =  0 and m  ≥  1. Let [formula] be the group-scheme representing M and put [formula]. The sub-functor [formula] of automorphisms preserving (base-changes of) the direct summand (A  /  a)m is represented by a closed sub-group scheme (still to be denoted G') according to lemma [\ref=t4].

Let [formula] denote the standard parabolic sub-group of automorphisms preserving the rank m direct summand. P is flat over S, as can be seen over [formula]. There is a morphism of S-groups f:P  →  G' which on points is given by sending [formula] to [formula], where [formula] and [formula] denotes the reduction of γ and π:Am  →  (A  /  a)m is the natural map. This "point-wise" description of f is immediately checked to be functorial and a homomorphism and hence does indeed define a morphism of S-groups. Obviously, [formula] is an isomorphism, hence so is f by lemma [\ref=t2]. This is however a contradiction, because f(S):P(S)  →  G'(S) is not injective, as [formula] and a  ≠  0,m  ≥  1.

Proof of lemma [\ref=t3]: Given a scheme X, a quasi-coherent OX-module F of finite presentation and some [formula] we have to show that there is an open sub-scheme X0  ⊆  X such for all [formula] if and only if f factors through X0. Consider [formula] and the exact sequence of OX-modules

[formula]

We claim that f*(φ) is an automorphism if and only if f*(G)  =  0: as f*(()) is exact, necessity is obvious. If, conversely, f*(G)  =  0 then for any y∈Y f*(φ)y is a surjective endomorphism of the finitely generated OY,y-module Fy, hence is an isomorphism, hence so is f*(φ).

So the sought for X0  ⊆  X is the complement of the support of G which is open, because G is finitely presented.

Proof of lemma [\ref=t4]: Given a scheme X and a short exact sequence 0  →  F'  →  F  →  F''  →  0 of quasi-coherent OX-modules with F' finitely presented and F'' locally free and some [formula], we have to show the representability by a closed sub-scheme of X of the following functor on X-schemes:

[formula]

Clearly, F is a Zariski sheaf, so the problem is local on X, i.e. we can assume that [formula] is affine, F'' corresponds to some An, F' corresponds to some A-module M for which there is a presentation Aa  →  Ab  →  M  →  0 and F corresponds to some A-module N. The exact sequence 0  →  F'  →  F  →  F''  →  0 then becomes an exact sequence [formula] of A-modules and we are given some [formula]. Consider ν: = παι. As all the above sequences are exact after any base-change, we have [formula].

We have a diagram (defining ψ):

[formula]

which is exact after any base-change, hence [formula], for any f:Y  →  X. So the closed sub-scheme of X we are looking for is the one defined by the ideal of A generated by the coefficients of any matrix representation of ψ.

Proof of 2') ⇒   1) in theorem [\ref=thm11]: Under the notations of [\ref=s11] we assume that F is representable by a scheme. Then so is F by lemma [\ref=t3], hence F is locally free by what has been shown in [\ref=s22].

Proof of 3) ⇒   1) and 3') ⇒   1) in theorem [\ref=thm11]: Under the notations of 1.1 we assume that X is locally noetherian and that either 3) or 3') holds as well as, by contradiction, that F is not locally free. By lemma [\ref=t3] we know in either case that F is representable by an algebraic space. Using the last assertion of lemma [\ref=t1] we can assume [formula] with A artin local. Then F is representable by a scheme according to [\cite=K], p. 25, 7) contradicting what we proved in [\ref=s22].
