In Medium Hadron Properties

Introduction

The change of hadron properties in the heat bath is of fundamental interest in heavy ion collisions. Especially non-perturbative in-medium effects in the vector channel, like the broadening of the resonance peak or a temperature dependence of the mass, could explain the puzzle of the experimentally observed low-mass enhancement of the dilepton spectrum. These properties of the hadrons are encoded in Euclidian time correlation functions (CF) GH(τ,T) which contain in principle all the spectral information in a given quantum number channel H. They can be calculated at a discrete set of times τ∈[0,1  /  aNτ] in the framework of lattice regularized QCD. A more direct access to these quantities is provided by the spectral function (SF) σH(ω,T) which is related to the correlation function through the integral equation

[formula]

with the renormalized current [formula]. The direct inversion of this equation to get the SF is an ill posed problem, but became feasible by the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM)[\cite=ja]. This method allows to obtain the most probable spectral function without a priori assumptions on the spectral shape. It was successfully applied at zero temperature but its application to non-zero temperature due to the limited temporal extension of the system remains a challenge.

The Free Spectral Functions

Up to now MEM has only been applied to data calculated within the Wilson discretization scheme for the fermion action. The corresponding SF show a broad bump at high ω which was interpreted[\cite=CPPACS] as reflecting a bound state of a light quark and a heavy Wilson doubler. To investigate this explanation in more detail and to study cut-off effects we calculated the free spectral function in the chiral and thermodynamic limit. Performing a variable transformation[\cite=ff] and the notation from[\cite=ma] the free lattice CF for Wilson fermions can be written as

[formula]

with [formula] as channel depending quantities. Therefore all cut-off dependencies are encoded in σLH which is shown for various channels in fig.[\ref=fig:free]. They agree with each other at energies below aω  ≤  1.5 which is a remanent of the chiral symmetry, but the explicitly chiral symmetry breaking Wilson term in the fermion action leads to quite different SFs of the chirally symmetric channels (pseudo-scalar(PS)/scalar(S) and vector(V)/axial-vector(AV)) at higher energies. The two cusps at [formula] and the cut off at [formula] reflect the three corners of the Brillouin zone which restrict the momentum phase space on the lattice. Therefore the naive picture that the fermion doublers appear as peaks in the SF with masses of O(1 / a) is perhaps too simple. However, the effect of the lattice cut-off on the low energy regime is small.

Temperature dependence of Correlation Functions and Spectral Functions

In the interacting case we have performed quenched simulations with the standard plaquette gauge action and non-perturbatively improved clover fermions on isotropic lattices with various sizes N3σ  ×  Nτ to investigate cut-off and finite volume effects. We simulated up to five different quark masses below and in the chiral limit above the critical temperature. To perform the simulations at different temperatures we varied β. To proper renormalize the currents we used nonperturbatively determined ZH-factors for the vector and axial vector channel and tadpole improved ZH-factors for the other channels. From spatial CFs we obtained screening masses via

[formula]

They show almost no temperature dependence below Tc(fig.[\ref=fig:spatial]) and the expected scaling with the temperature above Tc. The screening masses in the PS and S channel agree with each other already at 1.5Tc which is an indication that the UA(1) symmetry is already effectively restored at this temperature. The pole masses in the chiral limit can be addressed by using Eq.([\ref=eq:integ-equation]) and a zero temperature ansatz of the SF which leads in the pseudo-scalar channel to

[formula]

This quantity has the advantage to be UV save as opposed to the susceptibilities [formula]. After the extrapolation to the infinite volume limit the extrapolation to the chiral limit for 0.6Tc and 0.9TC (see fig.[\ref=fig:spatial]) leads to a vanishing pion mass which therefore remains a Goldstone boson. The SF obtained from MEM are illustrated in fig.[\ref=fig:TSF] where the SFs are only shown up to ω / T = 10 for clarity (see sec.[\ref=sec:fSF]). Below Tc the quark masses are chosen to give an approximately constant pion mass. In this way we get a constant vector mass below Tc so that we have no indication of a change in the rho mass at least up to 0.9Tc. Above Tc we see the scaling of the peak location with the temperature in both channels.

Thermal Dilepton Rates

In two flavor QCD the differential dilepton rate [formula] is directly connected to the vector spectral function σV(ω,T) by

[formula]

The Born rate is given by the free vector spectral function σfreeV = 0.75π- 2ω2 tanh (ω / 4T). To ensure that the results are not influenced by lattice artefacts we carried out the MEM analysis on data with different cut-offs (see fig.[\ref=fig:DL]). Employing Eq.([\ref=eq:DLrate]) to compute the thermal dilepton rate we see an enhancement over the Born rate in the region ω / T = 5 - 6 and a very close agreement at higher energies[\cite=dl]. The most striking feature is the sharp drop at energies below ω / T = 2 - 3. If this result persist even closer to Tc this implies that there are no thermal contributions to the dilepton rate at low energies which is in contradiction to other approaches[\cite=ap].This result is also corroborated by a direct inspectation of the correlation function at τT = 0.5, Eq.([\ref=eq:polemass]), which gives [formula] at T / Tc = 1.5 / 3. The finiteness of this number already requires a vanishing spectral function in the limit ω  →  0 and the fact that it is close to the value obtained with the free spectral function, GfreeV(1 / 2T,T) / T3 = 2, suggests that the contribution from the low ω region is small.
