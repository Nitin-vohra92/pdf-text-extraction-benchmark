Geometry of arithmetically Gorenstein curves in [formula]

Introduction

In this paper we illustrate some general results about arithmetically Gorenstein (AG) schemes in codimension 3 by a closer analysis of the geometry of AG curves in [formula]. We give a numerical criterion for when an AG curve Y in [formula] can be obtained in the form mH - K on an ACM surface X whose postulation character is the expected "first half" of the postulation character of Y. We also give examples of AG curves that cannot be obtained in this form on any ACM surface. Then we prove a theorem showing that a general AG curve with a given postulation character γ can be obtained by ascending CI-biliaison from a line, strengthening the result of Watanabe that any codimension 3 AG scheme is licci.

Section [\ref=sec1] contains a review of the structure of codimension 2 ACM schemes in [formula]. Section [\ref=sec2] contains a review of known results about codimension 3 AG schemes in [formula]. Section [\ref=sec3] contains the study of AG curves of the form mH - K on an ACM surface, together with examples. Section [\ref=sec4] contains the theorem about ascending CI-biliaisons.

I would like to thank the University of Barcelona whose invitation to speak there provided the impetus for writing this paper.

ACM codimension 2 subschemes of [formula]

There are in the literature many ways of recording the numerical information associated with a subscheme of projective space. Ellingsrud [\cite=E] uses a numerical type (nij) associated with a resolution of the ideal. Gruson and Peskine [\cite=GP] use a numerical character associated with the projection on a hyperplane. Then there is the Hilbert function H(n)  =  h0(OX(n)) of [formula]. If r  =   dim X, the difference function ∂r + 1H(n) is called the h- vector of X [\cite=M]. Finally, there is the postulation character, also called γ- character of [\cite=MDP]. The numerical information in each of these is more or less equivalent, but unfortunately the terminology varies from one place to another. We find it most convenient, following [\cite=MDP] and [\cite=N] to use the postulation character.

Definition. Let X be a closed subscheme of [formula] with ideal sheaf IX. Let [formula] be the postulation function of X. We then define the postulation character or γ- character of X to be γX(n)  =    -  ∂Nφ(n), the N-th difference function.

Proposition 1.1 [\cite=MDP], [\cite=N]. For any closed subscheme [formula], the γ-character has the following properties

γ(n)  =  0 for n  <  0.

γ(n)  =   - 1 for 0  ≤  n  <  s, where s  =   min {n|h0(IX(n))  ≠  0}, namely, the least degree of a hypersurface containing X.

γ(s)  ≥  0.

[formula].

Note that the function φ(n), and hence the Hilbert polynomial of X, can be recovered by numerical integration so that, for example, the degree and genus of a curve can be expressed in terms of its γ-character.

For an ACM subscheme of [formula] of dimension ≥  1 we have H1(IX(n))  =  0 for all n, so to know the γ-character is equivalent to knowing the Hilbert function h0(OX(n)).

For ACM subschemes in codimension 2 one has precise information about the possible γ-characters. We call a numerical function γ(n) admissible if it satisfies the four conditions of (1.1) for some positive integer s.

Theorem 1.2. a) Let X be a codimension 2 ACM subscheme of [formula]. Then its γ-character is positive in the sense that γ(n)  ≥  0 for all n  ≥  s.

b) Conversely, given an admissible numerical function γ(n) that is positive, as defined in a), there exists a codimension 2 ACM subscheme X in [formula] with that γ-character.

c) If, furthermore, X is integral, then γX is connected in the sense that {n|γ(n)  >  0} is a connected set of integers.

d) If γ is a positive connected numerical function, then there exists an integral ACM codimension 2 subscheme [formula] with that γ-character for all N  ≥  3. If N  =  3 or 4, X can be taken to be a smooth curve or surface, respectively.

Proof. These results are due to Gruson and Peskine [\cite=GP], see also [\cite=MDP], [\cite=M], and [\cite=N].

Remark. The condition "γ connected" is equivalent to the condition that the numerical character of [\cite=GP] should have no gaps, and the condition that the h-vector should be of decreasing type [\cite=M]. It is also equivalent to the condition m(X)  ≥  3 of Sauer (see [\cite=N]).

We have also the results of Ellingsrud about the Hilbert scheme and the theorem of Gaeta.

Theorem 1.3 [\cite=E]. For any positive admissible γ-character, the set of all ACM codimension 2 subschemes of [formula] is a smooth, irreducible, open subset of the Hilbert scheme of all closed subschemes of [formula]. (There is also an explicit formula for its dimension.)

Theorem 1.4 (Gaeta: see [\cite=PS]). A codimension 2 subscheme [formula] is ACM if and only if it is in the liaison equivalence class of a complete intersection.

AG codimension 3 subschemes of [formula]

Here we review the analogous results for arithmetically Gorenstein subschemes of codimension 3 of [formula]. See also [\cite=M] for a summary of these results.

A closed subscheme [formula] is arithmetically Gorenstein (AG) if its homogeneous coordinate ring is a Gorenstein ring. This is equivalent to saying X is ACM and its canonical sheaf ωX is isomorphic to OX(m) for some [formula].

Watanabe [\cite=W] showed that the homogeneous ideal of a codimension 3 AG scheme is minimally generated by an odd number of elements. His method of proof also allows one to deduce the following result, neither stated nor proved in his paper, but usually attributed to him.

Proposition 2.1 (Watanabe). Any AG codimension 3 subscheme of [formula] is in the CI- liaison class of a complete intersection.

Buchsbaum and Eisenbud [\cite=BE] explained the theorems of Watanabe by giving a structure theorem for Gorenstein codimension 3 algebras from which all further results about AG codimension 3 schemes are deduced.

Theorem 2.2 [\cite=BE]. The homogeneous ideal of any AG codimension 3 subscheme of [formula] is generated by the Pfaffians of the (n - 1)  ×  (n - 1) minors of a certain skew symmetric matrix of homogeneous polynomials, of odd rank n.

Stanley [\cite=S], drawing on old results of Macaulay, and applying the theorem of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud, characterized the possible h-vectors of AG codimension 3 subschemes. Translated into the language of the γ-character, his result is this.

Proposition 2.3 [\cite=S]. An admissible numerical function γ is the γ-character of an AG codimension 3 subscheme of [formula] if and only if

it is symmetric, meaning there exists an integer q such that γ(n)  =  γ(q - n) for all [formula] (which implies that q  =   max {n|γ(n)  ≠  0}), and

if we define the δ-character to be the "first half" of γ, namely

[formula]

then δ is a positive admissible function, as in (1.1).

Proof. For a codimension 3 subscheme of [formula], the γ-character is the negative of the second difference function of the h-vector. So the symmetry of the h-vector in Stanley's theorem [\cite=S] is equivalent to the symmetry of γ. For the second condition, Stanley says the first half of the first difference function of the h-vector should be an O-sequence. This says it is the h-vector of a codimension 2 zero-dimensional scheme [\cite=S]. But we know these by (1.2), namely δ should be admissible and positive.

Proposition 2.4 [\cite=MR]. The AG codimension 3 subschemes of [formula], for N  ≥  4, are parametrized by a smooth, open subset of the Hilbert scheme.

Proposition 2.5 [\cite=D]. The AG codimension 3 subschemes of [formula] with a fixed Hilbert function (i.e., with a fixed γ-character as in (2.3)) form an irreducible subset of the Hilbert scheme. (And Kleppe and Miró-Roig [\cite=KM] have given a formula for the dimension of this Hilbert scheme.)

For the existence of integral AG codimension 3 schemes in [formula], Herzog, Trung, and Valla gave a condition in terms of the degree matrix of the defining skew symmetric matrix of (2.2). Then De Negri and Valla translated this condition in terms of the h-vector. Combining their results and stating them with the γ-character, we have the following.

Theorem 2.6 [\cite=HTV], [\cite=DV]. a) If X is an integral AG codimension 3 subscheme of [formula], then its δ-character is connected (1.2c).

b) Conversely, if γ is a numerical function satisfying the conditions of (2.3) with δ connected, then there exists a normal integral AG codimension 3 subscheme of [formula] with that γ-character (for N  ≥  4). In particular, if N  =  4, we may take X to be a smooth curve.

Arithmetically Gorenstein curves in [formula]

Now we will look in more detail at the situation of curves in [formula]. If Y is an AG curve in [formula] with postulation character γY, we know from (2.3) that its "first half" δY is the postulation character of an ACM surface X in [formula]. So our first task will be to explore the relationship between the ACM surface X and the AG curve Y. There is a well-known method of obtaining an AG curve on an ACM surface.

Proposition 3.1. Let X be an ACM surface in [formula] satisfying the additional condition G1, Gorenstein in codimension 1. Let K be the canonical divisor, and let Y be an effective divisor linearly equivalent to mH - K for some [formula]. Then Y is an AG curve with [formula]. If X satisfies only G0, then the canonical divisor K may not be defined, but there is an anticanonical divisor M, and the same is true for an effective divisor Y  ~  mH + M.

Proof. This construction was given in [\cite=KMMNP]. See also [\cite=M]. The extension to the case where X satisfies only G0 is in [\cite=H1].

Lemma 3.2. Let X be an ACM surface in [formula] with postulation character γX, and let r  =   max {n|γX(n)  ≠  0}. Then

H2(OX(n))  =  0 for all n  ≥  r - 3.

IX is r-regular.

IX(r) is generated by global sections.

IX has a resolution

[formula]

with max {bj}  =  r + 1.

Proof. Since X is ACM, we have H1(OX(n))  =  0 for all n. Hence the Euler characteristic χ(OX(n))  =  h0(OX(n))  +  h2(OX(n)), and this is equal to the Hilbert polynomial of X. When we take difference functions of h0(O(n)), the third and fourth differences will be 0 if and only if the corresponding shift of h0(OX(n)) is equal to the polynomial χ(OX(n)). We conclude that γX(n)  =  0 for n  ≥  r + 1 is equivalent to h2(OX(n))  =  0 for n  ≥  r - 3.

Since IX has no H1 or H2, because of X being ACM, and [formula], we find IX is r-regular. This implies I(r) generated by global sections, by the theorem of Castelnuovo-Mumford.

Finally, take a minimal resolution of IX over the homogeneous coordinate ring, and sheafify. This gives an exact sequence of cohomology

[formula]

Because of the minimality of the resolution, max {bj}  >   max {ai}. Hence the largest n for which H3(IX(n))  ≠  0 is equal to the largest n for which some [formula]. We conclude n  ≥  r - 3 if and only if n - bj  >  5 for all j, and hence max {bj}  =  r + 1.

Lemma 3.3. Let X be a locally complete intersection surface in [formula], with ideal sheaf I. Then [formula].

Proof. [\cite=AG].

Lemma 3.4. Let Y be an AG curve in [formula] with [formula]. Then for all [formula], γY(n)  =  γY(m + 4 - n). In other words γY is symmetric with the q of (2.3a) equal to m + 4.

Proof. By duality on Y we have H2(OY(n)) dual to H0(OY(m - n)) for all n. Hence by Riemann-Roch,

[formula]

When we take the fourth difference function, this gives

[formula]

Hence γY is symmetric with q  =  m + 4.

Now we can state our main result about the AG curves of the form mH - K on an ACM surface X.

Theorem 3.5. Let X be an ACM surface in [formula] that is locally complete intersection, and let r  =   max {n|γX(n)  ≠  0}.

If m  ≥  2r - 5, the linear system |mH - K| is effective and without base points.

If m  ≥  2r - 4, then mH - K is very ample, and for any Y∈|mH - K|, with postulation character γY, its first half δY is equal to γX.

If m  ≥  2r - 2, the set of curves Y∈|mH - K| as X also varies in its family, forms an open subset of the Hilbert scheme if AG curves with postulation character γY.

Proof. We have assumed that X is local complete intersection so that ωX will be an invertible sheaf and K a Cartier divisor.

By (3.2), IX(r) is generated by global sections. Hence the same is true of (I  /  I2)(r) and also of Λ2(I  /  I2(r)). Using (3.3) this shows that [formula] is generated by global sections, so the corresponding linear system is effective and without base points.

It follows [\cite=AG] for m  ≥  2r - 4, that mH - K will be very ample. To show that δY  =  γX, we proceed as follows. First suppose m  ≥  2r - 3. I claim that γX(n)  =  γY(n) for n  ≤  r. There is an exact sequence

[formula]

We will show that the two outside terms are zero, hence the middle ones isomorphic. Since Y  ~  mH - K, [formula]. By duality on X, h1(IY,X(n))  =  h1(OX(m - n))  =  0, since X is ACM. Also h0(IY,X(n))  =  h2(OX(m - n)). Now our assumptions m  ≥  2r - 3 and n  ≤  r imply m - n  ≥  r - 3, so the h2 is 0 by (3.2). Thus h0(OX(n))  =  h0(OY(n)) and taking difference function γX(n)  =  γY(n) for n  ≤  r.

Now q = m + 4 by (3.4), hence q  ≤  2r + 1, so [formula]. So we see that the entire non-zero portion of γX is equal to the portion of δY for n  ≤  r. Since both are positive admissible characters, they are equal.

The same argument works for m  ≥  2r - 4 except for the case m = 2r - 4 and n = r. In this case [formula], and since the characters γX and δY are equal for n  <  r, and 0 for n  >  r, it follows that they are also equal for n = r by (1.1d).

We follow the method of [\cite=H2]. The proof given there already shows the desired result for m  ≫  0. Note that in [\cite=H2] the surface X is supposed smooth, but the same holds for X a locally complete intersection, in which case K will be a Cartier divisor.

The first step is that, since X is ACM, the dimension of the linear system |Y| on X is equal to h0(Y,NY / X). The second step is by the theorem of Ellingsrud (1.3) to note that the dimension of the family of ACM surfaces containing X is equal to [formula]. The third step is to notice that for m  ≥  2r - 3, each such curve Y is contained in a unique such surface X. Indeed, we have seen in the proof of b) above that for m  ≥  2r - 3 we have γX(n)  =  γY(n) for n  ≤  r, and hence H0(IX(n))  →  H0(IY(n)) is an isomorphism for n  ≤  r. Since IX is generated in degrees ≤  r (3.2), we see that the homogeneous ideal of X is uniquely determined by Y. It follows now that the dimension of the family of curves Y  ~  mH - K as X and Y vary is equal to [formula].

The next step is to show that for m  ≥  2r - 2 we have [formula]. To prove this, we need to show the vanishing of [formula] for i  =  0,1. Since Y  ~  mH - K, these are equal, using duality on X, to hi(X,IX  /  I2X(m)) for i  =  1,2.

Take a minimal resolution of IX, as in (3.2),

[formula]

Tensoring with OX(m) we get an exact sequence

[formula]

From (3.2) we know that ai,bj  ≤  r  +  1 for all i,j. So the hypothesis m  ≥  2r  -  2 implies that m - ai,m - bj  ≥  r - 3 for all i,j. So again by (3.2) it follows that H2(OX(m - ai))  =  H2(OX(m - bj))  =  0 for all i,j. Since X is ACM, we have H1(OX(n))  =  0 for all n, and now it follows easily that Hi(IX  /  I2X(m))  =  0 for i  =  1,2.

Now as in the proof of [\cite=H2] we find that

[formula]

The other inequality comes from the fact that the dimension of the family of all AG curves with the same γ-character is less than or equal to [formula], by the differential study of the Hilbert scheme. We conclude equality, so the two families have the same dimension, and the curves of the form Y  ~  mH - K with Y,X varying form an open subset of the Hilbert scheme of AG curves containing Y, as required.

Corollary 3.6. a) For each numerical function γ satisfying the numerical conditions of (2.3), there is an AG curve Y with postulation character γ, lying on an ACM surface X with postulation character γX  =  δY.

b) If, furthermore, the first half δ of γ is connected, we may take both X and Y to be smooth.

c) If the integers m and r associated with γ satisfy m  ≥  2r - 2, then there is an open subset V of the Hilbert scheme Hγ of AG curves with character γ, such that every Y∈V is of the form Y  ~  mH - K on an ACM surface X with character δ, the first half of γ.

Proof. Note that this corollary gives an independent proof of the existence results for AG curves quoted in (2.3) and (2.6). To prove the corollary, given γ, let δ be its first half. Then there exists a reduced, locally complete intersection ACM surface in [formula] with postulation character δ [\cite=N]. Let q  =   max {n|γ(n)  ≠  0} and take m  =  q - 4. If r  =   max {n|δ(n)  ≠  0}, then [formula] by definition of the "first half" function, so m  ≥  2r - 4. Then by the theorem, mH - K is very ample, and any curve in the linear system will be AG with postulation character having its first half equal to γX. By symmetry, γ is uniquely determined by δ and m, which shows that γY is equal to the γ we started with.

If δ is connected, then X can be taken to be smooth [\cite=N], and since mH - K is very ample, we can take Y to be smooth by the usual Bertini theorem.

The last statement c) is just a reformulation of (3.5c).

Now we will give some examples to illustrate Theorem 3.5 and show that its results are sharp.

Example 3.7. The linear system mH - K may be effective even for m  <  2r - 5. Let X be the Castelnuovo surface. Then γX  =   - 1  - 1 0 2, r  =  3, 2r - 5 = 1. Take m = 0. Note that - K  =  (3;18) in the usual notation for divisor classes on X (see, for example, [\cite=H3]). This class is effective and is represented by plane cubic curves Y  ⊆  X. They all pass through a ninth point Q∈X. Thus the linear system |Y| is not without base points.

Example 3.8. If m  <  2r - 4, then δY may not be equal to γX. One example is the plane cubic curve Y of the previous (3.7). In this case γY  =   - 1 1 0 1  - 1, and δY  =   - 1 1 corresponding to a plane H. This is not surprising since the minimal degree surface containing Y is a plane.

For a more interesting example let X be the Del Pezzo surface. Then γX  =   - 1  - 1 1 1, r  =  3, 2r - 4 = 2. Take m  =  1. Then Y  ~  H - K  =  2H, and Y is the complete intersection of three quadric hypersurfaces in [formula]. It is the canonical curve of degree 8 and genus 5, and γY  =   - 1  - 1 2 2  - 1  - 1, so δY  =   - 1  - 1 2, the γ-character of a cubic scroll. Our curve Y is on its surface X of minimal degree, yet its δY belongs to a surface of lower degree. There are curves Y'  ~  H - K on the cubic scroll X', also canonical curves (8,5), but these form a proper subfamily of all the AG (8,5) curves: they are the canonical embeddings of trigonal curves of genus 5.

In this example we see that while the family of AG curves Y with γY  =   - 1  - 1 2 2  - 1  - 1 is irreducible, equal to the family of canonical curves of genus 5 in [formula], there are two types: the general one being a complete intersection on the Del Pezzo surface and the special one lying on a cubic scroll. In both cases the associated character δY is that of a cubic scroll.

Example 3.9. We saw in the proof of (3.5c) that for m  ≥  2r - 3, the curve Y  ~  mH - K is contained in a unique ACM surface X with γX  =  δY. Here we show that for m  =  2r - 4, the surface X may not be unique.

Recall first that if X,X' are two ACM surfaces without common components, whose union is a complete intersection Z of hypersurfaces of degrees a,b, then the intersection [formula] is an AG curve [\cite=M]. In fact, I claim Y  ~  (a + b - 5)H  +  M on X where M is the anticanonical divisor. Indeed, since [formula] is a complete intersection, and X and X' have no common components, the surface X satisfies G0, so we can speak of the anticanonical divisor M [\cite=H1]. From the theory of liaison it follows that IX',Z  =  Hom(OX,OZ). But IX',Z  =  IY,X, and [formula]. Thus on X we have Y  ~  (a + b - 5)H + M, since ωZ  =  OZ(a + b - 5). So it follows from (3.1) that Y is AG with m  =  a + b - 5.

Now for our example, let X again be a Castelnuovo surface. This surface is contained in a unique quadric hypersurface F2, a cone over the nonsingular quadric surface in [formula]. The divisor class group of F2 is [formula], and X is in the class of bidegree (2,3). Let X' be another Castelnuovo surface of bidegree (3,2). Then [formula] is a complete intersection of F2 with a quintic hypersurface F5. Therefore [formula] is in the class of 2H - K, so this Y has m = 2, and is not contained in a unique Castelnuovo surface X.

We observe also that X passes through the singular point of F2, since by Klein's theorem it cannot be a Cartier divisor on F2, and this point is none other than the point Q mentioned above in (3.7). Indeed, the plane cubic curve of (3.7) is contained in a plane Π. This plane intersects F2 in at least a plane cubic curve, so Π  ⊆  F2, and Π must also contain the singular point. As the plane cubic curve moves in a pencil, so does Π, and the only point in common is Q, which must therefore be the singular point of F2.

The same argument shows that X' also contains Q, and so all the curves Y  ~  2H - K obtained by the construction [formula] for various X' contain this same point Q. On the other hand, the linear system |2H - K| is very ample by (3.5b), so we see that the curves Y obtained as [formula] for linked Castelnuovo surfaces X and X' are not general among all curves in the linear system |2H - K|.

Example 3.10. We give an example to show that (3.5c) is sharp, namely an example of curves with m  =  2r - 3 on an ACM surface X that are not general in their Hilbert scheme. Let X be a Castelnuovo surface, with γX  =   - 1  - 1 0 2. Then r = 3. We take m  =  2r - 3  =  3, and consider curves Y  ~  3H - K on X. These have character γ  =   - 1  - 1 0 2 2 0  - 1  - 1 and have degree 18 and genus 28. Each such curve Y is contained in a unique quadric hypersurface F2, which is the same one that contains the Castelnuovo surface X, and therefore is singular, by Klein's theorem.

On the other hand, there are AG curves Y of degree 18 and genus 28 of the form Y  ~  3H - K on the sextic K3 surface X, which is a complete intersection of any quadric and cubic hypersurfaces, [formula]. In this case we can take F2 to be smooth, so that the unique quadric hypersurface F2 containing Y is smooth, and so Y is not on a Castelnuovo surface. Thus the family of Y  ~  3H - K on Castelnuovo surfaces is special in Hγ.

Example 3.11. For our last example we show that for certain γ, the general AG curve with postulation character γ is not of the form mH - K on any ACM surface.

Take γ  =   - 1  - 1  - 1 6  - 1  - 1  - 1. Then δ  =   - 1  - 1  - 1 3 is the postulation character of a Bordiga surface. There are curves Y  ~  2H - K  =  (11;310) on a Bordiga surface X. These curves have degree 14 and genus 15. The dimension of the family of all such Y on Bordiga surfaces X is less than or equal to the dimension of the linear system |Y| on X plus the dimension of the family {X} of all Bordiga surfaces. Now dim X|Y|  =  h0(NY / X)  =  h0(OY(Y)). We calculate Y2  =  31 from its divisor class representation on X. Since 31  >  2gY  -  2, the linear system OY(Y) is nonspecial, and h0(OY(Y))  =  31  +  1  -  15  =  17. The dimension of the family {X} is 36, by [\cite=E]. Thus the family of all Y  ~  2H - K on Bordiga surfaces has dimension ≤  17  +  36  =  53.

On the other hand, from the general theory of the Hilbert scheme, we know that the dimension of any irreducible component of the Hilbert scheme of curves of degree d and genus g is ≥  5d  +  1 - g. In our case, this gives 56. (In fact, the dimension is exactly 56 [\cite=KM].) Thus the general AG curve Y with given γ cannot be of the form 2H - K on a Bordiga surface.

It remains to show that Y cannot be of the form mH - K on any other ACM surface. If X is an ACM surface of degree δ and sectional genus π, and if Y  ~  mH - K, then we can easily compute the degree d of Y as (Y.H) on the surface, and this gives d  =  (m + 1)δ  -  2π  +  2. In our case, since γ  =   - 1  - 1  - 1 6  - 1  - 1  - 1, we have q  =  6 and m  =  2. So we must have d  =  3δ  -  2π  +  2. Now looking at the possible pairs (δ,π), which will be the degree and genus of a nondegenerate ACM curve in [formula], we see (left to reader) that 3δ  -  2π  +  2  ≤  14 always with equality only for (δ,π)  =  (6,3). So the only way to obtain the curve Y as mH - K on an ACM surface is as 2H - K on a Bordiga surface.

R. Miró-Roig [\cite=MR1] has verified by a dimension count that there are similar examples of AG curves of arbitrarily high degree that cannot be obtained in the form mH - K on any ACM surface.

Problem 3.12. For those postulation characters γ of AG curves for which the associated m and r satisfy m  =  2r - 3 or m  =  2r - 4, give a stratification of the Hilbert scheme of AG curves with character γ, according to the least degree of an ACM surface containing the curve, the gonality of the abstract curve, which ones are of the form mH - K on an ACM surface, and the dimensions of the strata, so as to generalize and complete the information illustrated in examples (3.8), (3.10), and (3.11) above.

Complete intersection biliaison

If C is a curve in [formula], recall that a complete intersection (CI) biliaison of C is obtained by taking a complete intersection surface [formula], and taking a curve C'  ~  C  +  hH on X, where H is the hyperplane class, and [formula]. It is ascending if h  ≥  0. The equivalence relation generated by these is called CI- biliaison and it is equivalent to even CI-liaison [\cite=GD].

In this section we will show that a general AG curve in [formula] is obtained by ascending CI-biliaisons from a line. This provides a new proof and strengthening of Watanabe's result (2.1) for general AG curves.

Lemma 4.1. Let Y be an AG curve in [formula] with postulation character γ. Let s  =   min {n  >  0|γ(n)  ≥  0}, let q  =   max {n|γ(n)  ≠  0}, and let m be the integer for which [formula]. Then

m  =  q - 4.

IY(q - s) is generated by global sections.

IY is (q - 1)-regular.

Proof. Part a) we recall for memory (3.4). For parts b), c) we use the theorem of Buchsbaum-Eisenbud [\cite=BE] in the notation of [\cite=HTV]. Let S be the homogeneous coordinate ring of [formula]. Then the homogeneous ideal IY of Y has a resolution of the form

[formula]

with [formula] for some positive integer r. Moreover, this resolution is symmetric in the sense that if we order [formula] and [formula], then bi  =  c  -  ai for each i. Furthermore, if we let uij  =  bi  -  aj be the associated degree matrix, then uij  >  0 for i + j  =  2r + 3.

To relate this to the invariants s and q of the γ-character, first note that the ai are the degrees of a minimum set of generators of IY. Hence a1  =  s, which is the least degree of a generator. By symmetry, b1  =  c - s. Computing [formula] using this resolution, we find [formula]. Hence m  =  c - 5 and q  =  c - 1. From the inequality u2,2r + 1  >  0 we find b2  >  a2r + 1  =   max {ai}. But b1  =  c  -  s  ≥  b2, so we find max {ai}  <  c - s. Hence max {ai}  ≤  q - s, and IY(q - s) is generated by global sections.

Finally, to show that IY is (q - 1)-regular, we use this resolution to show h2(IY(q - 3))  =  0 by climbing up the resolution and using the fact that [formula].

Theorem 4.2. For any postulation character γ corresponding to an AG curve in [formula] (as in (2.3)), there is a nonempty open subset Vγ of the corresponding Hilbert scheme Hγ of these curves, such that any curve Y∈Vγ can be obtained by strictly ascending CI- biliaisons from a line in [formula].

Proof. We will prove by induction on the degree, the following slightly more precise statement. For each γ, there is an open set Vγ  ⊆  Hγ such that for any Y∈Vγ

There is a complete intersection surface [formula] containing Y that is reduced, and such that for each irreducible component Ui of [formula], the intersection [formula], and

There is an AG curve Y'  ~  Y  -  H on X, with postulation character γ', such that Y'∈Vγ'.

To begin with, by definition of s, Y is contained in a hypersurface Fs of degree s. Since IY(q - s) is generated by global sections, there is a hypersurface Fq - s containing Y, whose intersection with Fs is a surface X. Thus every Y∈Hγ is contained in a complete intersection surface Xs(q - s), and so the property (i) is an open condition on Hγ.

We start the induction with AG curves Y having s  =  1. These are contained in a [formula], so they are complete intersection curves, and for these the theorem is immediate. We descend by the biliaison of (ii) unless Y is a plane curve, in which case we do biliaisons in the plane containing Y.

So now we assume s  ≥  2. Suppose for a moment that Y  ⊆  X satisfies condition (i). We will show that the linear system |Y - H| is nonempty and contains an AG curve Y'. We use the exact sequence of [\cite=GD], twisted by - H:

[formula]

Now [formula], and ωY  =  OY(m)  =  OY(q - 4), so the sheaf on the right is just OY. Since h0(OX( - H))  =  h1(OX( - H))  =  0, we find h0(L(Y - H))  =  h0(OY)  =  1, so it has a unique section s whose restriction to Y is 1. From the condition that Y meets every irreducible component of [formula], and X being reduced, we conclude that s is nondegenerate, and defines an effective divisor Y'  ~  Y  -  H [\cite=GD]. Furthermore, since s restricted to Y is 1, we find that [formula] as subsets of X.

Now consider the sequence of [\cite=GD] for Y':

[formula]

Since Y'  ~  Y  -  H and [formula], the sheaf L(Y') is invertible isomorphic to L( - H) on [formula], which is a neighborhood of Y'. Thus [formula]. From this we find [formula]. Hence Y', which is ACM by virtue of the biliaison from Y to Y', is arithmetically Gorenstein. We can compute its γ-character

[formula]

Now we explain the induction step of the proof. Given γ with s  ≥  2, define a character γ' by the recipe just given. By the induction hypothesis there exists an open set Vγ'  ⊆  Hγ' of curves satisfying (i) and (ii). Let Y' be such a curve, and let [formula] satisfy (i). Note that q'  =  q - 2 and s' is either s or s - 1. So define a surface [formula] or [formula], where H1,H2 are hyperplanes in general position. Then X is a reduced complete intersection surface of degree s(q - s).

On this surface X, we will show, by an argument analogous to the one above, that a general curve Y in the linear system Y'  +  H on X is an AG curve. First we write the sequence of [\cite=GD] for Y', twisted by H:

[formula]

Knowing that [formula] we see as above that the right-hand sheaf is OY'. Since X is a complete intersection, H1(OX(H))  =  0, so the map H0(L(Y' + H))  →  H0(OY')  →  0 is surjective. Since the sheaf L(Y' + H) has nondegenerate sections (for example corresponding to the trivial biliaison Y' + H), there exists a nondegenerate section s∈H0(L(Y' + H)) whose image in H0(OY') is 1. Let Y be the associated divisor. Then [formula], and the sequence of [\cite=GD] for Y shows as above, that [formula]. Hence Y is an AG curve. Since the trivial biliaison Y'  +  H satisfies (i), and this is an open condition, we can choose Y also so that it satisfies (i).

Thus there exists an open subset of curves Y∈Hγ satisfying (i). Since the procedures of constructing Y' from Y and Y from Y' are reversible, we can find an open subset Vγ  ⊆  Hγ of AG curves Y satisfying (i) with the associated curve Y' lying in Vγ'.

This completes the inductive proof of (i) and (ii). To prove the theorem, we take a Y∈Vγ, and by (ii) find a Y'∈Vγ' with smaller degree. We continue this process until either the degree is 1 or s  =  1, which we have discussed above.

Remark 4.3. If we restrict our attention to nonsingular AG curves Y, the curve will lie on a nonsingular complete intersection surface Xs(q - s), and if Y is sufficiently general, the associated curve Y'  ~  Y - H will also be nonsingular. Note that if Y has connected δ-character (2.6) then Y' also has connected δ-character. Thus we can carry out the CI-biliaisons using only nonsingular AG curves lying on nonsingular complete intersection surfaces.

Example 4.4. We have seen (3.11) that the general AG curve Y with γ  =   - 1  - 1  - 1 6  - 1  - 1  - 1, a curve of degree 14 and genus 15, cannot be obtained in the form mH - K on any ACM surface. But applying our theorem, we see that it can be obtained in the form Y'  +  H on a complete intersection surface X3.3, where Y' has γ'  =   - 1  - 1 4  - 1  - 1. This is an AG curve of degree 5 and genus 1, which we may take to be nonsingular when Y is sufficiently general.

The curve Y' in turn lies on a complete intersection X'2.2, a Del Pezzo surface, and Y''  =  Y'  -  H' on X' is a line. Thus Y is obtained by two ascending CI-biliaisons from a line.
