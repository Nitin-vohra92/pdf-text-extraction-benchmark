GROUP CLASSIFICATION OF NONLINEAR SCHRÖDINGER EQUATIONS

Introduction

A nonlinear Schrödinger equation is one of the most interesting and important models of contemporary mathematical physics. Its completely integrable version was studied by many mathematicians (in particular, see [\cite=takhtadjian_&faddeev.86.rus] and references therein). This equation is also used in geometric optics [\cite=takhtadjian_&faddeev.86.rus] and nonlinear quantum mechanics [\cite=doebner&goldin.94].

The main aim of the present paper is to perform the group classification of nonlinear Schrödinger equations of the form

[formula]

for a complex function ψ  =  ψ(t,x) of n + 1 real independent variables t = x0 and [formula], [formula], with respect to an arbitrary element (a smooth function F = F(ψ,ψ*)). Here and below, a subscript of a function means its differentiation with respect to the corresponding variable and the superscript .of any complex quantity denotes complex conjugation. The indices a and b vary from 1 to n. It is assumed that summation is carried out over repeated indices.

The class of equations (1) includes certain known equations as particular cases, namely, the free Schrödinger equation (F = 0), integrable Schrödinger equation with cubic nonlinearity (F = σ|ψ|2ψ), Schrödinger equation with logarithmic nonlinearity (F = σ ln |ψ|  ψ, which, for [formula], is equivalent to the equation proposed in [\cite=bialynicki-birula&mycielski])), etc.

Until recently, the only method for the solution of problems of group classification of partial differential equations has been the direct integration of defining equations for the coefficients of the operator of Lie symmetry with subsequent cumbersome examination of all possible cases, which considerably decreases the class of solvable problems of group classification. Various modifications of the standard algorithm proposed, e.g., in  [\cite=zhdanov&lahno.jphys.a.1999] [\cite=nikitin&wiltshire.conf99] enable one to solve some of these problems. In the present paper, we use a new approach to the group classification of equations ([\ref=nsche]) based on the investigation of the compatibility of the classifying system of equations with respect to an "arbitrary element".

Kernel of main groups and equivalence group

Let the infinitesimal operator

[formula]

generate a one-parameter symmetry group of equation ([\ref=nsche]). (Here η is a complex-valued function and ξ0, ξa are real-valued functions of t, x, ψ, ψ*.) By using the infinitesimal criterion of invariance [\cite=ovsyannikov.rus] [\cite=olver.rus] passing to the manifold defined in the extended space by the system of equation ([\ref=nsche]) and its conjugate, and carrying out separation with respect to unbound variables, we obtain the following defining equations for the coefficients of the operator Q:

[formula]

(there is no summation over a here) and

[formula]

Integrating equations ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.1]), we obtain the following expressions for the coefficients of the operator Q:

[formula]

where [formula] η0 and ζ are complex-valued functions and χa a are real-valued functions.

Equation ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2]) is a classifying condition that imposes further restrictions on the coefficients of the operator Q. depending on the form of the function F. If F is not fixed, then, upon the separation of equation ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2]) with respect to the "variables" F, Fψ, Fψ*, we get η = 0, ξ0t = 0, χat = 0, which, with regard for relations ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.1]), yields the following statement:

Proposition. The kernel of main groups of equations of class ([\ref=nsche]) is the Lie group whose Lie algebra A ker is the direct sum of Euclidean algebras in the space of the variable t and in the space of the variables x, i.e.,

[formula]

The equivalence group of equation ([\ref=nsche]) coincides with the group generated by the collection of one-parameter groups of local symmetries of the system

[formula]

the infinitesimal operators of which have the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a complex-valued function of the variables t, x, ψ, ψ*, F and F*, [formula] is a complex-valued function of the variables t, x, ψ, ψ*, and 0, a are real-valued functions of the variables t, x, ψ, ψ*. Using the infinitesimal criterion of invariance for systems ([\ref=system.equiv.nsche]) and separating them with respect to un-bound variables, we obtain defining equations for the coefficients of the operator [formula]. According to these equations, the Lie algebra of the equivalence group Gequiv of equation ([\ref=nsche]) is generated by the operators

[formula]

Therefore, the equivalence transformations nontrivially acting on F have the form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

The restriction of the class of equations ([\ref=nsche]) can lead to the appearance of equivalence transformations different from transformations ([\ref=general.equivalance.transformation.for.nsche]) (see the proof).

Result of classification

All the possible cases of extension of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of equation ([\ref=nsche]) are exhausted to within the equivalence transformations ([\ref=general.equivalance.transformation.for.nsche]) and their conditional extensions by the cases given in Tables 1 and 2. We present only basis elements from the complement with respect to A ker. After specifing the function f in each case presented in Table 1, further extensions of the invariance algebra are possible, that is shown with Table 2. For describing results of classification, it is convenient to use the amplitude ρ = |ψ| and phase [formula] of the function ψ. Let us introduce the notations

[formula]

Cases of extension where the expression for the function F contains an arbitrary complex-valued smooth function f of one real variable Ω. Here γ, γ1, γ2, δ, δ1, δ2 are real constants and [formula] is an arbitrary solution of the equation   Δθ  =  δ2θ.

Cases of extension where the expression for the function F does not contain arbitrary functions. Here γ, γ1, γ2, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4 are real constants, [formula], [formula] (and |σ| = 1 mod Gequiv); [formula] is an arbitrary solution of the original equation and [formula] is an arbitrary solution of the Laplace equation Δθ = 0. For cases 2.9-2.15, δj  =    ±  1 mod Gequiv for one value of j ∈ {1;2;3;4} if [formula].

Result of classification of the subclass F = f(|ψ|)ψ

In the class of equation ([\ref=nsche]), we separate the subclass of Galilei-invariant equations with the nonlinearities F = f(|ψ|)ψ, i.e., equations of the form

[formula]

The symmetry properties of these equations were studied in many papers (see, e.g., [\cite=f.imath81] [\cite=fs.jphA87.on.nsche] [\cite=fshs.rus] [\cite=chopyk.imath92]). At the same time, we do not know works containing correct and exhaustive results concerning the group classification in the class of equations ([\ref=ginsche]). We separate them from the results presented in the previous section.

Theorem. The Lie algebra of the kernel of main groups of equations of class ([\ref=ginsche]) is the extended Galilei algebra

[formula]

The complete collection of inequivalent (with respect to local transformations) cases of extension of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of equations of the form ([\ref=ginsche]) is exhausted by the following cases (below, we present only basis operators from the complement to A ker|  |; [formula], [formula], |σ| = 1 mod Gequiv; [formula]; δ2  =    ±  1 mod Gequiv and δ1  =    ±  1 mod Gequiv for cases (iii) and (iv), respectively]:

1. f = σ|ψ|γ,   where [formula]:   I - γD;

2. f = σ|ψ|4 / n:   [formula],   Π;

3. f =  - (δ1 + iδ2) ln |ψ|,   where [formula]:     eδ2t(δ2I - δ1M);

4. f =  - δ1 ln |ψ|,   where [formula]:   I - δ1tM;

5. f = 0:   I,   D,   Π, [formula]

[formula] where η0  =  η0(t,x) is an arbitrary solution of the original equation.

Proof of the result of classification

Let A max = A max(F) be the maximal Lie invariance algebra of equation ([\ref=nsche]) with F = F(ψ,ψ*). If there is an extension (i.e., [formula]) then there exist such operators in A max that the substitution of their coefficients in condition ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2]) gives a (nonidentical) equation for F. Each equation of this type has the form

[formula]

where a, b, c, d, e are complex constants. The differential consequences of equations of the form ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]), which are of the first order (as differential equations), also reduce to the form ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]). Thus, [formula] iff the function F satisfies k (k∈{1;2;3}) independent equations of the form ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]). It is convenient to consider the linear case separately.

It should be noted that application of the standard methods of group classification in this problem reduces to the investigation of different cases of integration of one equation of the form ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]) (depending on the values of the constants a, b, c, d, e) with subsequent decomposition into cases of further extension of the symmetry group if the function F satisfies certain additional conditions. This requires a cumbersome examination procedure with multiple repetition of the same cases. The method proposed enables one to significantly decrease the number of cases that should be examined.

Linear case. Let F be a function linear in (ψ,ψ*), i.e., F = σ1ψ  +  σ2ψ*  +  σ0, where σ0, σ1, σ2 are complex constants. We can always set the constant σ0 equal to zero by using the transformation t̃ = t,  = x, ψ̃  =  ψ  +  ν0  +  ν1t + ν2xaxa from the extension Gequiv; here, the complex constants ν0, ν1 and ν2 are determined by the form of F. Then, depending on the value of the constant σ2 (σ2 = 0 or [formula]), by using transformations from Gequiv and from the conditional extension of Gequiv (t̃ = t,  = x, ψ̃  =  ψeiσ1t or [formula]) the function F can be reduced to cases 2.1 and 2.2 (where [formula]), respectively.

Below we assume that F is a function nonlinear with respect to (ψ,ψ*) and, hence, [formula] in ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]).

k = 1. It follows from ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2]) that

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] (otherwise, A max = A ker).

For [formula] b = 0 mod Gequiv, whence η0 = 0, e = 0, d =  - iδa, where [formula]. In addition, if [formula] then c + a =  - |a|2 mod Gequiv, ξ0tt = 0, χat = 0, [formula] and d = 0 (case 1.1, where [formula], [formula]). If c + a = 0, [formula], then [formula], ξ0t = 0, χat = 0, λa = 0, λt  =  δλ (case 1.2, where [formula]). If c + a = 0, [formula], then [formula] (and, furthermore, [formula]), ξ0t = 0, χatt  =  δχat, [formula], [formula] (cases 1.3 and 1.4 for [formula] and δ = 0 respectively).

If a = 0, then [formula] (and, furthermore, b = i mod Gequiv), η1 = 0 (whence, d = 0, ξ0tt = 0, χat = 0), [formula]. Then, for [formula] c = 1 mod Gequiv, [formula], η0 = iξ0t, e = 0, (case 1.5), and, for c = 0 ξ0t = 0, η0 = ie-  δ1tθ(x), where Δθ  =  δ2θ, [formula], [formula] (case 1.6).

k = 2. Assume that there exists a function F nonlinear with respect to (ψ,ψ*) that satisfies a system of two independent equations of the form ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]), i.e.,

[formula]

where aj, bj, cj, dj, ej (j = 1,2) are complex constants and

[formula]

Lemma 1. One of the following conditions is satisfied to within transformations from Gequiv and real linear transformations of equations themselves:

1. a1 = 1, a2 = 0, b1 = 0, b2 = i, c2 = 0, id1 = e2(c1 + 1), d2(c1 + 2) = 0, [formula];

2. a1 = 1, a2 = i, b1 = b2 = 0, d1(c2 + a2) = d2(c1 + a1), c1e2 = c2e1;

3. a1 = a2 = 0, b1 = 1, b2 = i, d1c2 = d2c1, b1d2 + c1e2 = b2d1 + c2e1.

Equation ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2]), regarded as a condition on F, is to depend on equations ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F.2]) for any fixed operator from A max. Therefore, for finding all defining equations for ξ0 and η additional to ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.1]), it suffices to equate to zero the third-order minors of the extended matrix of the system of linear algebraic equations ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2]), ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F.2]) with respect to the "unknowns" Fψ, Fψ*, F, i.e.,

[formula]

(Equations ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2a]) can be splitted with respect to the variables ψ and ψ*.)

We consider each case of Lemma 1 separately and seek only additional extensions (as compared with those presented in Table 1) of the invariance algebra.

1. It follows from ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2a]) that [formula] (i.e., ξ0tt = 0, χat = 0, [formula]), η0 = iρ(t,x), where [formula], -  ρt + iΔρ + e1ζ + e2ρ = 0, iζt + d1ζ + d2ρ = 0. The additional extension A max exists only if d1 = d2 = e2 = 0, [formula], [formula]. Under these conditions, equation ([\ref=nsche]) is reduced to case 2.3 (if [formula]), where γ =  - c1, or case 2.4 (if c1 = 0), where σ =  - e1, by the following transformation from the extension of Gequiv: t̃ = t,  = x, ψ̃  =  ψ  +  ν0  +  ν1t + ν2xaxa, where the real constants ν0, ν1 and ν2 are determined by the form of F.

2. It follows from ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2a]) that η0 = 0, [formula], [formula], [formula], where

[formula]

whence d̃1(2 + 1) = d̃21, 1ẽ2  =  2ẽ1. System ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F.2]) can be represented in the form

[formula]

[formula] (otherwise, we have a partial case of case 1.1).

If 1 =  - 1, 2 = 0, then ξ0t = 0, ẽ1  =  ẽ2 = 0 (otherwise, A max = A ker). Therefore,

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. Depending on the values of the constants δl, [formula], we arrive at cases 2.9-2.15.

If 1 =  - 1, 2 = 0, then the additional extension A max exists only if ẽ1  =  ẽ2 = 0, [formula]. Then, depending on the value of 2, by a transformation from the extension Gequiv, one can reduce equation ([\ref=nsche]) (1) to case 2.6 (if [formula]), where [formula], [formula], or case 2.7 (if [formula], [formula]), whhere γ =  - 22, or case 2.8 (if 2 =  - 2 / n).

3. It follows from ([\ref=det.eqs.for.nsche.2a]) that η1 = 0 (i.e., ξ0tt = 0, χat = 0, ζ = 0), [formula], [formula], [formula], where the constants j, d̃j, ẽj (j = 1,2) are defined in ([\ref=definition.of.tilde.c1.c2.d1.d2.e1.e2]). We can represent system ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F.2]) in the form

[formula]

For the existence of an additional extension of A max, the following conditions are to be satisfied: d̃1  =  d̃2 = 0, [formula]. Hence, *1  =  2 =  - 1 mod Gequiv. Then, by the transformation t̃ = t,  = x, [formula] from the extension of Gequiv equation ([\ref=nsche]) is reduced to case 2.5.

k = 3. The following statement is true:

Lemma 2. Suppose that a function F satisfies a system of three independent equations of the form ([\ref=nshe.cc.for.F]). Then the function F is linear with respect to (ψ,ψ*).

We have completed the classification of the class of equations ([\ref=nsche]). In addition to the known particular cases presented in  [\cite=fs.jphA87.on.nsche] [\cite=chopyk.imath92], we have obtained a complete collection of inequivalent equations ([\ref=nsche]) that admit a nontrivial symmetry.

Note that the results concerning the group classification of systems of two equations of diffusion (equation ([\ref=nsche]) belongs to this class if it is regarded as a system of two equations for two real functions] were addused in [\cite=nikitin&wiltshire.conf99]. Our results confirm and improve the results presented in [\cite=nikitin&wiltshire.conf99].
