Gamma-Ray Burst Luminosity Functions Based on Luminosity Criteria

Introduction

Since there are no large systematically selected samples of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) with redshifts available yet, the derivation of their luminosity function requires a luminosity criterion to estimate the redshifts. In this paper, we use the results of five recent studies using one or more luminosity criteria to compare the resulting luminosity functions and to derive from each the expected source counts and the Euclidean value of < V / V max  >  .

These studies are presented in detail in Fenimore and Ramirez-Ruiz (2000) (FR), Schmidt (2001) (S), Schaefer, Deng and Band (2001) (SDB), LLoyd-Ronning, Fryer, and Ramirez-Ruiz (2002) (LFR), and Norris (2002) (N). The luminosity criteria used in these studies are variability (FR, SDB, LFR), spectral lag (SDB, N) and spectral hardness (S). References to original work on these luminosity criteria are given in the individual papers.

Our use of the spectral hardness was based on its correlation with < V / V max  >   (Schmidt 2001), which we interpreted in terms of a correlation between the peak luminosity of GRBs and the observed photon spectral index α23 (based on BATSE channels 2 and 3). This appears to be supported by the correlation of the isotropic-equivalent energy Erad and α23 shown in Figure 1. The data used are based on BeppoSAX observations of 12 GRBs with redshifts (Amati et al. 2002). We derived the values of α23 from those given for the Band α and β parameters and the redshift. It is curious, however, that no correlation is seen between Erad and either the Band α or β parameter.

Luminosity Functions

Generally, the authors used one or two luminosity criteria to assign peak luminosities to each GRB in a sample complete above a stated flux limit. The luminosity function Φ(L,z) was then derived, see the references. Since 'LFR' and 'N' gave only the luminosity distribution of their samples, we derived the luminosity function using the spectral properties and cosmological parameters adopted by the authors.

The redshift dependence or cosmological evolution of Φ(L,z) derived or adopted in four of the studies was a density evolution ~  (1 + z)3 up to redshifts z  =  2  -  10. 'LFR' concluded that in addition there was luminosity evolution (1 + z)3. 'N' did not consider any evolution. Details about the application of the luminosity criteria, and the evolution of the luminosity function can be found in the individual papers. Finally, since not all luminosity functions were given in terms of numbers per unit volume per unit time, we applied a normalization factor such that, following the procedure discussed in the next section, each produces a rate of 53 GRBs per year above a photon flux of 5 ph cm- 2 s- 1.

Figure 2 shows the luminosity functions Φ(L,z) at z = 0, where L refers to the peak luminosity Lpeak at a time resolution of 1024 ms. The cosmological parameters used are ΩM  =  0.3, ΩΛ  =  0.7, and H0  =  65 km s- 1 Mpc- 1. The 'N' luminosity function extends to log Lpeak  ~  46 where its ordinate is ~   + 2.3. The five luminosity functions show considerable divergence, partly caused by differences in the cosmological evolution.

Source Counts and < V / V max  >

For a given luminosity function Φ(L,z), the source counts N( > P) as a function of photon flux P can be derived (see Schmidt 2001). We show in Figure 3 the resulting expected source counts for the five luminosity functions. Also shown are the observed counts based on the BD2 sample of GRBs described in Schmidt (1999). Even though we had normalized the five luminosity functions (see section 2), the expected source counts show considerable divergence. The counts for 'N' are very flat, probably a consequence of not including any cosmological evolution. At low values of P the other four predicted counts are high, only partially caused by the incompleteness of the counts setting in for P  <  0.5 ph cm- 2 s- 1. Obviously, most of the curves have no predictive value in estimating the number of GRBs that may be detected by future deep missions.

The Euclidean value of < V / V max  >  , which to first order characterizes the steepness of the source counts N( > P), has the advantage that it accounts for the variation of sensitivity over a survey. We have derived < V / V max  >   for each of the luminosity functions, where for the individual sources V / V max  =  (P / Plim)- 3 / 2. We use for the limiting photon flux Plim  =  0.25 ph cm- 2 s- 1, which characterizes both the BD2 sample and the BATSE catalog. The results are given in Figure 3. Conservatively assuming that the observed value < V / V max >  = 0.34 has an r.m.s. error of ±  0.01 (Schmidt 2001), we see that four of the predicted values deviate by 6 - 24 sigmas. The agreement for 'S' reflects the fact that < V / V max  >   for each spectral class was used directly to set its contribution to the luminosity function.

Discussion

The key to understanding the systematics of Figure 3 is twofold. First, the Euclidean value of < V / V max  >   is a distance indicator for uniformly distributed cosmological objects (Schmidt 2001). Second, < V / V max  >   is larger for objects with stronger positive cosmological evolution. Hence, if the expected value of < V / V max  >   is larger than the observed one, the model luminosities L are too low and/or the cosmological evolution is too strong (see Schmidt 1999, Table 1). Since the observed value of < V / V max  >   is known quite accurately, important information about Φ(L,z) is missed if it is not used. We recommend that any study of Φ(L,z) take into account the Euclidean value of < V / V max  >  .
