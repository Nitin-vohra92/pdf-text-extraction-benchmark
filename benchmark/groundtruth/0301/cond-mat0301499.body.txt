Criticality versus q in the 2 + 1-dimensional Zq clock model

Matter coupled-gauge field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions have come under renewed scrutiny in the context of condensed matter physics in the past decade, as effective theories of strongly correlated system[\cite=baskaran]. Concepts such as confinement-deconfinement transitions associated with the proliferation and recombination of topological defects of gauge fields, enter for instance in attempts at providing a theoretical foundation for breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory in more than one dimension. A large variety of such gauge-field theories have been proposed, and one model of particular interest is the compact abelian Higgs model[\cite=baskaran] [\cite=KNS1] [\cite=Smiseth:2003] [\cite=Sudbo:2002]. This model consists of a compact gauge field coupled minimally to a bosonic scalar field with the gauge charge q. In a particular limit the dual of this model reduces to a loop-gas representation of the global Zq model[\cite=Smiseth:2003] [\cite=Sudbo:2002]. This identification has been the motivation for the current work, for a detailed account of the q dependence of the full theory we refer to Ref. [\cite=Smiseth:2003] [\cite=Sudbo:2002].

The spin Zq model is a simple planar-spin model, where the direction of the spin is parametrized by a phase. This phase is restricted to the values 2πn / q with [formula], and is defined by the following action

[formula]

The state is specified by the integer variables [formula]. Special cases include q = 2 which is the Ising model, q = 3 which is the three state Potts model, and the limit q  →    ∞   which corresponds to the XY model. In addition it is easy to see that for q = 4 the partition function Z(2β,4)  =  Z(β,2)  ×  Z(β,2). The aim of the current paper has been to determine how the critical properties interpolate between the well known Ising (q = 2) and XY (q  →    ∞  ) limits. We have done this by measuring the exponent combination (1  +  α) / ν as a function of q.

In d = 2 the model has a quite peculiar phase structure, with an intermediate incompletely ordered phase (IOP), where the system shows behaviour similar to the critical Kosterlitz Thouless phase. Upon further cooling, the system will order completely into one of the q completely ordered states[\cite=Elitzur:1979] [\cite=Norikazu:2002]. In d = 3 the Zq model does not have an IOP, but there are generalisations of the model which do [\cite=Norikazu:2002] [\cite=Ueno:1991] [\cite=Ueno:1993].

A related case is that of a globally U(1) symmetric theory which is perturbed by a weak crystal field. Using RG and duality arguments it has been shown that for q  ≥  5 the crystal field is an irrelevant perturbation, whereas for q  ≤  4 the XY fixed point is rendered unstable[\cite=Jose:1977].

It is important to emphasise that we have focused on the properties of the Zq model at the critical point. For T < Tc the discrete nature of the model will always be apparent. A beautiful RG study of the Z6 model shows how the couplings of the model flow towards a fixed point which is ultimately different from the 3DXY fixed point in the T  →  0 limit[\cite=Blankschtein:1984] [\cite=Oshikawa:2000]

Eq. [\ref=PhaseZ_q] is strahtforwardly reformulated as a model of an interacting ensemble olinks which either form closed loops or originate and termine at point charges. We start with the partition function

[formula]

The first step is to replace the cosine with a quadratic potential, this is the Villain approximation[\cite=Villain:1975]. Next, we promote the integers ni to real-valued phase variables θi, at the expense of introducing an auxiliary integer field Q, which through the Poisson summation formula[\cite=Kleinert:1989:book] restricts the θi variables to the discrete values allowed by original theory. The resulting partition function is then given by In Eq. [\ref=Z_qVillain], [formula] is an integer link field living on the links of the original lattice, and {Q} is a scalar field living on the sites of the same lattice. The prefactor Ξ[β] and effective coupling βV  =  βV(β) must be retained to get results which agree with Eq. [\ref=Z_qPart] on a quantitative level[\cite=Kleinert:1989:book], however they do not affect the critical properties and from now on we will assume βV  =  β, Ξ[β]  =  1, and omit the V index on the partition function.

In Eq. [\ref=Z_qVillain], the Q-field explicitly accounts for the discrete nature of the Zq model. Setting [formula], we recover the Villain representation of the XY model. Due to this similarity, the remaining analysis follows well known steps [\cite=Stone:1978], which we briefly include for completeness. A Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling of the quadratic expression in Eq. [\ref=Z_qVillain] is performed by introducing an auxiliary field [formula], thus bringing the partition function onto the form In Eq. [\ref=Z_qHS] the [formula] summation can be performed, thereby restricting the velocity field [formula] to integer values denoted by [formula]. In the term coupling Δθ and [formula], a partial integration can be performed, such that θ only appears in the combination [formula], from this we get the constraint

[formula]

At this stage the transformation to a loop gas is complete, and the partition function is given by

[formula]

This is a theory consisting of the field [formula] living on the links of the lattice, and the field {Q} which lives on the sites. The field {Q} is sibject the constraint [formula], i.e. overall charge neutrality, whereas the field [formula] must satisfy the local constraint [formula] on all lattice points. The latter constraint means that every + Q /  - Q pair must be joined by q occupied links, in addition we can have [formula] excitations which are not nucleated to any + Q /  - Q pairs, these must form closed loops. Fig. [\ref=Z2Config] shows a typical configuration for the q = 2 model.

In the compact Abelian Higgs model considered in refs. [\cite=Sudbo:2002] [\cite=Smiseth:2003] the fields [formula] and {Q} represent vortices and monopoles, i.e. they are the topological excitations of the matter-field and gauge-field respectively. That interpretation does not apply in the current case, but the interpretation of the {Q} field is that it maintains the discrete properties of the original theory Eq. [\ref=PhaseZ_q]. With [formula] (the q  →    ∞   limit), Eq. [\ref=ZLoopGas] reduces to a loop-gas with steric repulsion, this is a well known model with an inverted XY transition[\cite=Dasgupta:1981]. Note that the special case q = 1 effectively represents no constraint. In this case, the theory Eq. [\ref=ZLoopGas] is noninteracting, and sustains no phase transition. For all q  ≥  2 Eq. [\ref=ZLoopGas] has a phase transition, between a phase filled with link segments for β  >  βc, and a vacuum phase which does not contain link excitations.

We have performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the Zq model, using both a phase-representation, Eq. [\ref=PhaseZ_q], as well as the loopgas/dumbbell gas (LDG) representation, Eq. [\ref=ZLoopGas]. The phase representation is simulated as a conventional spin simulation. In the LDG representation, the fundamental Monte Carlo moves are represented by alternating attempts of inserting a closed loop excitation of the [formula] field and a dumbbell configuration consisting of a + Q /  - Q pair connected with an occupied q-valued link (the vertical link to the left in Fig. [\ref=Z2Config] is an example of an elementary dumbbell excitations). For q = 2 the (vacuum) excitations of a loop or a + Q /  - Q pair have the same energy, while for q  >  2 the elementary dumbbell excitations are more expensive than the elementary loop excitations, and their relative importance diminishes with increasing q.

The main goal has been to determine how the critical properties change with q. The central quantity we have considered is the connected third order moment of the action [\cite=Sudbo:2002]

[formula]

which recently has been demonstrated to yield surprisingly good scaling results compared to second moments [\cite=Sudbo:2002]. When approaching the critical point, the correlation length ξ diverges as [formula]. Therefore, in a finite system of linear extent L we find that the third order moment in Eq. [\ref=STre] scales with L as

[formula]

The main advantages of the third order moment in Eq. [\ref=STre] are that (1) good quality scaling is achieved for practical system sizes even for models with α  <  0, e.g. the 3DXY model, and (2) one set of measurements gives both the combination (1 + α) / ν and - 1 / ν independently [\cite=Sudbo:2002], although it is more difficult to achieve high precision on the latter. A schematic figure of [formula] as a function of coupling constant is shown in Fig. [\ref=skjematisk], and figures [\ref=MIIIzq] and [\ref=MIIILG] show finite-size scaling (FSS) of the peak to peak value.

We have considered systems of size L  ×  L  ×  L with L = 8,10,12,16,20,24,32,40,48, and up to 2  ·  107 sweeps over the lattice. In addition to the q = 4 and q = 5 presented in figures [\ref=MIIIzq] and [\ref=MIIILG], we have also studied the q values q = 6,8,12,16 and 24, ref. [\cite=Sudbo:2002] shows results of q = 2 simulations of Eq. [\ref=ZLoopGas]. We find that the combination (1  +  α)  /  ν changes abruptly from the Z2 value of 1.763 [\cite=Hasenbusch:1998] to the XY value of 1.467 [\cite=Hasenbusch:2001] when increasing q from q = 4 to q = 5. A further increase of q beyond q = 5 does not affect the value of (1  +  α) / ν, as shown in Fig. [\ref=univ_exp].

That the Zq model is in the XY universality class for q  ≥  5 must imply that at the critical point the discrete structure is rendered irrelevant for these q values. To investigate this point further, we have implemented a simple real-space RG procedure, which attempts to probe for what values of q the discrete nature of Zq model is relevant at the critical point. We denote the untransformed phases and fields as θ0. The renormalized phase at level n + 1 is given by the block spin construction

[formula]

where the sum over k in Eq. [\ref=blockEq] is over the eight spins in a 2  ×  2  ×  2 cube. For q = 2, this transformation is clearly trivial, since adding a number of phases 0 and π will still give 0 or π. However, for q > 2 the effective [formula] will increase with n, and for n  →    ∞   the resulting block spins can take any direction.

We next investigate whether the system flows towards an infinite value of [formula] or not under such a RG transformation. This is tantamount to asking whether the discrete structure is rendered irrelevant or not on long length scales. To this end, at each iteration step n, we have recorded histograms hn(θ) of the phase distributions on the lattice, and monitored the manner in which this histogram flows under rescaling. By purely visual inspection we find that for q = 4 the discrete nature of the Zq model persists, whereas for q = 5 it is washed away, this is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=Hist].

To study this RG flow at a quantiative level, we have written the phase distribution Pn(θn) as a sum of harmonic functions

[formula]

Here, the coefficient an,k in Eq. [\ref=harmonic] denotes the k-th Fourier-cosine component at RG level n. Clearly, the coefficient an,q is the interesting component, we have studied how this coefficient flows under repeated rescaling. For q = 4 this coefficent shows critical fixed point behaviour, whereas for q = 5 it flows to zero, even for T well below the critical temperature, this is shown in Fig. [\ref=FlowFig].

Also the LDG representation Eq. [\ref=ZLoopGas] gives a qualitative indication that for q  ≥  5 the discrete nature of the theory is irrelevant. In this representation the discrete nature is represented solely by the Q excitations, so measurements of [formula] should give a quantitative indication of the the importance of the discrete structure. Measurements of 〈|Q|〉 at the critical point give 〈|Q|〉  ≈  0.07,5.9  ·  10- 4 and 2.75  ·  10- 6 for q = 2,4 and 5 respectively, whereas the link density [formula] for all q. Hence at q = 5 the discrete Q excitations hve been completely frozen out, and the tangle is essentially identical to the pure-loop tangle of the 3DXY model.

In summary, we have determined the critical exponent combination (1  +  α) / ν in the d = 3 Zq spin model for q  ≥  4. Using two different representations we have found that for q  ≥  5, the combination (1  +  α) / ν takes a value which is consistent with the value taken in the 3DXY model. Along with other more qualitative indicators this means that at the critical point discrete structure finer than q = 5 is irrelavant at the critical point, and the long distance properties of the theory are determined by the larger symmetry group U(1). These results are in accordance with RG studies starting with a U(1) symmetric theory which is perturbed by a perturbation with Zq symmetry.
