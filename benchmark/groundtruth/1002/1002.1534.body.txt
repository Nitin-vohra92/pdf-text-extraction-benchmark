Comment on "Clock Shift in High Field Magnetic Resonance of Atomic Hydrogen"

Ahokas et al. [\cite=Ahokas_3D] measured the hyperfine frequency shifts in three-dimensional spin-polarized atomic hydrogen by means of ESR. In this Comment, we address their analysis of the interaction energy of the ground-state H atoms in different hyperfine states and show that the quoted difference Δa = at - as between the triplet and singlet scattering lengths derived from the correctly measured shifts is overestimated by a factor of two.

Ahokas et al. observed the transitions a  →  d and b  →  c in the presence of the third-state atoms (b and a, respectively) and found the shifts of the corresponding resonance fields to be ΔBad = Cabnb + Caana and ΔBbc = Cbbnb + Cbana with [formula] cm3 and Caa, Cbb  ≪  Cba. To explain this observation, Ahokas et al. expressed the spin states of a pair of atoms in the |S,mS,I,mI〉 basis, that is, in terms of electron and nuclear singlets and triplets. In particular, in the high-field limit, [formula], [formula]. At low temperature, only the symmetric components |et,nt〉 and |es,ns〉 contribute to (s-wave) scattering via the triplet Vt and singlet Vs interatomic potential, respectively.

More specifically, the interaction energy of H atoms in different hyperfine states α and β (α,β = a,b,c,d) is given by the second-quantization Hamiltonian (i,j = α,β; i  ≠  j) [\cite=Dau9]

[formula]

The wavefunction of two bosons must be symmetric,

[formula]

where the spatial and spin parts are, respectively, [formula] and [formula]. The use of the symmetric form (2) of the diatomic wavefunction instead of simply [formula] does not change the sum (1) because the bosonic creation (annihilation) operators [formula] and [formula] ([formula] and [formula]) with i  ≠  j obviously commute. The interaction strength λ of the pseudopotential [formula] has the eigenvalues λs or λt corresponding to the spin states |es〉 or |et〉 of the atomic pair. As such, the potential is nearly independent of nuclear spins: 〈etns|λ|etns〉  =  〈etnt|λ|etnt〉  =  λt and 〈esnt|λ|esnt〉  =  〈esns|λ|esns〉  =  λs (here we write only the spin parts of the matrix elements). Instead, Ahokas et al. used 〈etns|λ|etns〉  =  〈esnt|λ|esnt〉 = 0 arguing that the antisymmetric states do not scatter via s-waves. This zeroing is only valid if the matrix elements include the vanishing spatial factor [formula]. Actually, it is this spatial factor, which cancels the contribution of the antisymmetric states to s-wave scattering and to the interaction energy (1). On the contrary, the spatial part of the matrix elements for the symmetric states R+|ij〉+ is doubled. In other words, the atoms of a heterostate symmetric pair behave as identical.

Clearly, |ab〉+ = |etnt,0〉 and [formula]. Consequently, [formula] and [formula]. Then, according to Eqs. (1), (2), the interaction energies are Eab  =  λtnanb, [formula], [formula] and the shifts become

[formula]

in agreement with our previous result [\cite=Safonov_08]. Note, that Ahokas et al. consider the atoms of a symmetric heterostate pair as distinguishable and therefore lose a factor of two in the expressions for the shifts. From Eqs. (3) and (4) we find [formula] and Δa = 30(5) pm. This is somewhat lower than the theoretical values Δa = 42 - 55 pm for the difference in the scattering lengths [\cite=Williams] [\cite=Jamieson] [\cite=Chakraborty].
