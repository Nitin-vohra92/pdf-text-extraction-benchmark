Solutions of Special Asymptotics to the Einstein Constraint Equations

Introduction

Let M be a three-dimensional manifold. Let g be a Riemannian metric and K be a symmetric (0,2)-tensor on M. The Einstein constraint equations are

[formula]

where μ and J are energy density and momentum density respectively. The triple (M,g,K) is called an initial data set if it satisfies the above constraint equations. It is called a vacuum initial data set if additionally μ = 0 and J = 0. In general relativity, the constraint equations are derived from the Gauss and Codazzi equations for the hypersurface M in spacetime satisfying the Einstein equation, and g and K are respectively the induced metric and the induced second fundamental form of M (see, for example [\cite=W]).

An initial data set (M,g,K) is called asymptotically flat at the decay rate q if, outside a compact set, M is diffeomorphic to [formula] and if there exists an asymptotically flat chart {x} so that, for some q > 1 / 2,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and the subscript in the big O notation indicates the corresponding decay rate on successive derivatives, e.g. f  =  O1(r- q) means that there is a constant C uniformly in r so that |f|  ≤  Cr- q and |∂f|  ≤  Cr- 1 - q.

We introduce the momentum tensor π  =  K  -  (gK)g, and define the constraint map

[formula]

Then the Einstein constraint equations take the form Φ(g,π)  =  (2μ,J).

In the asymptotically flat chart, the following physical quantities are defined as limits of surface integrals over Euclidean spheres with the standard surface measure on {r  =  ρ}:

[formula]

where Y(i) are the rotation vector fields, e.g. Y(1)  =  x3∂2  -  x2∂3. These integrals correspond to the energy E, linear momentum [formula], center of mass [formula], and angular momentum [formula].

It is well-known that the energy and linear momentum of an asymptotically flat manifold are well-defined [\cite=Bartnik] [\cite=C]. However, center of mass and angular momentum are the terms in the expansion of the solution (g,π) which are of lower order than those which determine the energy and linear momentum, and they may not be well-defined unless some extra condition (for example, the RT condition below) is imposed.

Assuming E  ≠  0, the center of mass and angular momentum are well-defined for asymptotically flat manifolds with the RT condition [\cite=BO] [\cite=H] [\cite=RT]. Moreover, all known exact solutions to the constraint equations satisfy the RT condition. In particular, the families of Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions which are exact solutions to the vacuum constraint equations satisfy the RT condition. It was not clear whether the vacuum asymptotically flat manifolds without the RT condition do exist, because one may tend to think the asymptotics of the solutions to the vacuum constraint equations are rigid. We show that the asymptotics are not rigid. Indeed, we can construct solutions with prescribed asymptotics, in particular without the RT condition.

Using a cut-off technique of Corvino and Schoen [\cite=CS06], we have the following theorem. Assume that σ,τ are symmetric (0,2)-tensors defined outside a compact set in [formula]. Assume that σij,τij are components of σ,τ with respect to the standard Euclidean coordinate chart {x}.

In order to construct solutions of special asymptotics, one has to find explicit σ and τ satisfying [\eqref=eq:sigma] and [\eqref=eq:tau]. In section [\ref=sec:special], we give examples of σ and τ. Therefore, we can construct families of asymptotically flat manifolds without the RT condition and show that their enter of mass and angular momentum [\eqref=def:ctm] and [\eqref=def:am] are ill-defined (Corollaries [\ref=co:ang], [\ref=co:ctm], and [\ref=co:ang2]). It is desirable to weaken the RT condition in order to define center of mass and angular momentum. The examples in section [\ref=sec:special] may help us to understand these physical quantities. Another application of the above theorem when σ and τ are chosen compactly supported in the annular shell is in the forthcoming paper of Rick Schoen, Mu-Tao Wang, and the author [\cite=HSW].

Constructing Solutions of Prescribed Asymptotics

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main], we introduce the weighted Sobolev spaces. Then we can weaken the definition of asymptotically flat manifolds and define (g,π) to be asymptotically flat at the decay rate q if

[formula]

and Φ(g,π)  =  (2μ,J) with

[formula]

In the proof, we assume that p > 3 / 2 and q∈(1 / 2,1). The following proof is similar to the argument by Corvino and Schoen [\cite=CS06]. The difference is that they consider the case where σ = 0 and τ = 0, and they work on vacuum initial data sets, i.e. μ = 0 and J = 0. In our case, we allow more general σ and τ, as long as they satisfy the linearized constraint equations. Their argument can apply to our setting, except that linearized equations are slightly different due to the presence of σ,τ,μ and J.

Solutions of Special Asymptotics

In order to construct solutions of explicit asymptotics, the key is to solve σ and τ in [\eqref=eq:sigma] and [\eqref=eq:tau]. In this section, we show some special examples of σ and τ and use Theorem [\ref=thm:main] to construct asymptotically flat initial data sets which violate the RT condition. In subsection [\ref=subsec:1], we discuss a family of solutions at decay rate exactly equal to one. In subsection [\ref=subsec:2], we discuss another family of solutions whose decay rate is less than 1. Moreover, we show that the center of mass and angular momentum of these examples are ill-defined.

Solutions at the decay rate equal to 1

Let σ and τ be

[formula]

where α and β are arbitrary C2 functions defined over the unit sphere S2. Because α and β are independent of r, by direct computations, we have the following lemma:

For any α,β∈C2(S2), σ and τ satisfy the linearized constraint equations [\eqref=eq:sigma] and [\eqref=eq:tau].

For any α,β∈C2(S2), there exists a vacuum initial data set [formula] with the following asymptotics:

[formula]

Solutions at the decay rate less than 1

We consider another family of τ satisfying [\eqref=eq:tau]. Let u be any C2 function on [formula]. Let

[formula]

By direct computations,

[formula]

We can choose, for example, u  =   log r. Then

[formula]

Notice that τij  ≠  O1(r- 2) because the logarithmic term. More generally, if we let u  =  r(1 - q) / 2 for q < 1, τ  =  O1(r- 1 - q).

Choosing this particular τ from [\eqref=eq:tau2], we have another example of a vacuum asymptotically flat manifold whose angular momentum is not defined.

Let [formula] satisfy [\eqref=eq:gasymptotics] and [\eqref=eq:piasymptotics] where σ and τ have the expression [\eqref=eq:exsigma] and [\eqref=eq:tau2]. Then if

[formula]

the angular momentum with respect to Y  =   - x2∂1  +  x1∂2 diverges.
