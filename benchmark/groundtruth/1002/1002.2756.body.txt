Generalized Möbius type functions and special set of k-free numbers

Introduction

Möbius function of order k, introduced by T. M. Apostol [\cite=apostol1], is defined by the following formula:

[formula]

The generalized function is denoted by μk,m(n), where 1 < k  ≤  m. If m = k, μk,k(n) is defined to be μk(n), and if m > k the function is defined as follows:

[formula]

In this paper we show some relations that hold among the functions μk,m(n). We introduce the new type of k-free integers and we make a connection between generalized Möbius function and the characteristic function q*k,m(n) of these. We use these to derive an asymptotic formula for the summatory function of q*k,m(n).

Basic lemmas

The generalization μk,m, like Apostol's μk(n), is a multiplicative function of n, so it is determined by its values at the prime powers. We have

whereas

[formula]

In [\cite=apostol1] Apostol obtained the asymptotic formula

Later, Suryanarayana [\cite=suryanarayana1] showed that, on the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, the error term in ([\ref=11]) can be improved to

for some positive constant k. In 2001 A. Bege [\cite=bege1] proved the following asymptotic formulas.

For x  ≥  3 and m > k  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

If the Riemann hypothesis is true, then for x  ≥  3 and m > k  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

uniformly in x, n and k.

If s > 0, [formula], x  ≥  1, then

Generalized k-free numbers

Let Qk denote the set of k-free numbers and let qk(n) to be the characteristic function of this set. Cohen [\cite=cohen1] introduced the Q*k set, the set of positive integers n with the property that the multiplicity of each prime divisor of n is not a multiple of k. Let q*k(n) be the characteristic function of these integers.

[formula]

We introduce the following special set of integers

[formula]

with the characteristic function

[formula]

The function qk,m(n) is multiplicative and

[formula]

We introduce the following set Q*k,m which the generalization of Q*k. The integer n is in the set Q*k,m,  1 < k < m iff the power of each prime divisor of n divided by m has the remainder between 1 and k - 1. The characteristic functions of these numbers is

[formula]

If we write the generating functions for this functions we have the following result.

If m  ≥  k and the series converges absolutely we have

[formula]

The function μk,m(n) multiplicative, when the series converges absolutely (s > 1) we have

[formula]

In the similar way because q*k,m(n) multiplicative we have:

[formula]

Because qk,m(n) multiplicative and qk,m(n) = |μk,m(n)| we have:

[formula]

In the particular case when m = k we have μk,m(n) = μk(n), qk,m(n) = qk + 1(n) and

[formula]

We have the following convolution type formulas.

If m  ≥  k

[formula]

Because qk,m(n) and μk,m(n) are multiplicative, results that both sides of ([\ref=21_28]) are multiplicative functions. Hence it is enough if we verify the identity for n = pα, a prime power. If [formula] and 0 < i < k

If [formula] and k < i < m

If [formula]

[formula]

The ([\ref=21_29]) follows by Möbius inversion formula.

Asymptotic formulas

For x  ≥  3 and m > k  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

uniformly in x, n and k, where

[formula]

for some absolute constant A > 0.

By ([\ref=21_28]) and ([\ref=31]) with n = 1 we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now we use [\ref=2.4.] and the fact that δ(x)xε is increasing for all ε > 0, then we choose ε > 0 so that [formula] we obtain ([\ref=41]).

Applying the method used to prove Theorem 1, and making use of Lemma [\ref=2.2.] we get to

If the Riemann hypothesis is true, then for x  ≥  3 and m > k  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

uniformly in x, n and k.
