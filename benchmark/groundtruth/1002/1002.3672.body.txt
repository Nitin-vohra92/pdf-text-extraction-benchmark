On the predual of non-commutative H∞

{

Introduction

Let [formula] be the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disk [formula] equipped with the supremum norm ||  -  ||∞, and it is known that [formula] is faithfully embedded into [formula] by taking non-tangental limits. Via the embedding [formula] has the 'standard' predual [formula], where [formula] denotes the pre-annihilator of [formula] in the dual pairing [formula]. The space [formula] has received much attention in Banach space theory, and indeed many serious investigations were carried out, see e.g. [\cite=Pelczynski:CBMS77],[\cite=Pisier:CBMS86]. The present notes are part of our attempts, started at [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09], to give more 'functional analysis insight' to many theorems obtained in those investigations on [formula] by discussing them in some non-commutative setup.

Natural non-commutative generalizations of [formula] were introduced by Arveson [\cite=Arveson:AJM67] in the 60's under the name of maximal subdiagonal algebras, and we here call them non-commutative H∞-algebras. The finite tracial ones have been well-studied so that we mainly deal with the finite tracial non-commutative H∞-algebras in the present notes. Let M be a finite von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal tracial state τ. A σ-weakly closed unital (not necessarily self-adjoint) subalgebra A of M is called a finite tracial non-commutative H∞-algebra, which we denote by A  =  H∞(M,τ), if A + A* is σ-weakly dense in M and the unique τ-preserving conditional expectation [formula] is multiplicative on A. Here we denote [formula], while the symbol [formula] has been used as the dual Banach space of a given Banach space X. The reader can find an excellent survey for non-commutative H∞-algebras in [\cite=PisierXu:Handbook03]. It is plain to see that A has the 'standard' predual [formula], which is the main object in our study.

It is the main purpose of the present notes to prove that any weakly relatively compact subset in [formula] can be 'lifted up' to a weakly relatively compact subset in [formula]. In particular, it immediately follows that the Mackey topology on A is indeed the relative topology induced from that on M. Hence this part of the present notes provides a non-self-adjoint generalization of Sakai's result [\cite=Sakai:IllinoisJMath65] (also Akemann's result [\cite=Akemann:TAMS67]). Here, recall that this liftability property was already established by many hands, e.g., Kisljakov [\cite=Kisljakov:SovietMathDokl75], Delbaen [\cite=Delbaen:SeminaireFA-Polytech77-78], Peł czynski [\cite=Pelczynski:CBMS77], in the 70's for the classical and commutative [formula] and its function algebra generalizations (see [\cite=Pelczynski:CBMS77] for further information), and it played a key rôle in any existing proof of the fact that [formula] has the Dunford-Pettis property. However the predual of any non-type I von Neumann algebra does never have the Dunford-Pettis property due to Bunce [\cite=Bunce:PAMS92] so that there is no hope to establish the Dunford-Pettis property for non-commutative [formula] in general. Nevertheless, the liftability of weakly relatively compact subsets still survive for non-commutative [formula].

The second purpose is to give some supplements to our previous notes [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09]. Firstly we briefly explain how the results in [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] can easily be generalized to the case of semifinite tracial non-commutative H∞-algebras [formula] with semifinite M and faithful normal semifinite tracial weights [formula]. Secondly we discuss the results in [\cite=Ando:CommentMath78] that still remain to be proved in the non-commutative setup.

Weakly Relatively Compact Subsets in [formula]

Throughout this section let us assume that A = H∞(M,τ) is a finite tracial non-commutative H∞-algebra. In what follows we freely identify [formula] with 'the normal part' of [formula] by the embedding [formula]. It was already verified in [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] that [formula] has the Pełczynski property (V[formula]) so that the weak relative compactness of a given subset W in [formula] is characterized by the following property: For any wuC series [formula] in [formula] one has lim k  →    ∞ sup {|φ(ak)| | φ∈W}  =  0. Here a wuC (= weakly unconditionally Cauchy) series [formula] in a Banach space X means a formal series consisting of elements xk in X such that [formula] for any [formula]. See [\cite=AlbiacKalton:Book] for more on wuC series. We begin with a lemma, which originates in Chaumat's work [\cite=Chaumat:Unpublished74],[\cite=Chaumat:PacificJMath81].

Let {φk} be a bounded sequence in [formula]. Let [formula] be a weak[formula]-accumulation point of {φk}, and φ  =  φn  +  φs be the Lebesgue decomposition in the sense of [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09], that is, the normal and singular decomposition of its Hahn-Banach extension (i.e., norm-preserving extension)   =  n  +  s in the sense of Takesaki [\cite=Takesaki:Book1] provides such a decomposition as simultaneous restrictions to A. If [formula], i.e., s|A  ≠  0, then there is a subsequence {φk(j)} such that the mapping [formula] is surjective.

By assumption there is b∈A with s(b)  =  1, and also by [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] together with Pełczynski's trick (see the proof of [\cite=HarmandWerner^2:Book] or [\cite=AlbiacKalton:Book]) there are a sequence {ai} in A and a projection [formula] such that (i) lim i  →    ∞ai  =  0 in [formula], (ii) lim i  →    ∞ai  =  p in [formula], (iii) s  =  s  ·  p, (iv) [formula] for every [formula] with a0: = 0. Set bi: = aib, [formula]. Then (a) φk(bi)  →  0 as i  →    ∞   for every [formula]; (b) φ(bi)  =  (bi)  =  n(aib)  +  s(aib)  →  (s  ·  p)(b)  =  s(b)  =  1 as i  →    ∞  . The rest of the proof is the same as in [\cite=Chaumat:Unpublished74] or [\cite=Chaumat:PacificJMath81], but we will give a detailed argument for the sake of completeness.

We then prove that there are two subsequences {bi(j)}, {φk(j)} with the properties: (c) |φk(j1)(bi(j2))|  ≤  1 / 2j2 + 2 for j1  ≤  j2 - 1; (d) |φk(j1)(bi(j2)) - 1|  ≤  1 / 2j2 + 2 for j1  ≥  j2. By (b) one can find i(1) in such a way that |φ(bi(1)) - 1|  ≤  1 / 16. Since φ is a weak[formula]-accumulation point of {φk}, there is k(1) so that |φk(1)(bi(1))  -  φ(bi(1))|  ≤  1 / 16. Thus, |φk(1)(bi(1)) - 1|  ≤  1 / 8. Assume, as induction hypothesis, that one has already constructed the desired bi(j)'s and φk(j) until j = l, and also that those bi(j), 1  ≤  j  ≤  l, satisfy |φ(bi(j))  -  1|  ≤  1 / 2j + 3. By (a) and (b) one can find i(l + 1) with [formula] in such a way that |φk(j)(bi(l + 1))|  ≤  1 / 2l + 3 for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  l and |φ(bi(l + 1)) - 1|  ≤  1 / 2l + 4. Since φ is weak[formula]-accumulation point of {φk}, one can also find k(l + 1) with [formula] in such a way that |φ(bi(j))  -  φk(l + 1)(bi(j))|  ≤  1 / 2l + 4 for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  l + 1. Hence |φk(l + 1)(bi(j)) - 1|  ≤  1 / 2l + 3  ≤  1 / 2j + 2 for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  l + 1. In this way, the desired subsequences can be constructed by induction.

Let α  =  {αj} be an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers with ||α||∞: =  sup |αj|  <    +    ∞  . Set [formula], [formula]. Notice that the subsequence {bi(j)} still satisfies that (e) [formula] for any [formula] due to (iv). Thus there is [formula] in the σ-weak topology such that [formula], [formula] and, in particular, cα falls in A. Remark that there is a universal constant K > 0 (i.e., independent of the particular choice of α) such that ||cα||∞  ≤  K||α||∞ (see the proof of [\cite=AlbiacKalton:Book]). By (c) and (d) one has |φk(j1)(bi(j2) - bi(j2 + 1))|  ≤  1 / 2j2 + 1 if j1  ≠  j2 and also |φk(j)(bi(j) - bi(j + 1)) - 1|  ≤  1 / 2j + 1. Hence |φk(j)(cα)  -  αj|  ≤  ||α||∞ / 2. Set d1: = cα Then, consider α(2): = {αj  -  φk(j)(d1)} and construct d2: = cα(2) from α(2) in the same way as above. Since ||α(2)||∞  ≤  ||α||∞ / 2, one has ||d2||∞  ≤  K||α||∞ / 2 and |φk(j)(d1 + d2)  -  αj|  ≤  ||α||∞ / 4. In this way, we can inductively construct [formula] so that ||dl||∞  ≤  K||α||∞ / 2l - 1 and [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and [formula] for all j.

The non-commutative Gleason-Whitney theorem ([\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09],[\cite=BlecherLabuschagne:Studia07], and also see Remark [\ref=R-2.5] below) says that the unique Hahn-Banach extension [formula] gives a right inverse of the quotient map from [formula] onto [formula]. Let us denote by [formula] the set of all [formula] with φ(1)  =  ||φ||. It is easy to see that [formula], where [formula] denotes all the positive normal linear functionals on M.

A subset [formula] is weakly relatively compact if and only if so is [formula].

The 'if' part is trivial. Hence it suffices to prove the 'only if' part. On contrary, suppose that W̃ is NOT weakly relatively compact. By the Eberlein-Smulian theorem there is a sequence {k}  ⊂  W̃ such that any its subsequence does NOT converge in [formula]. Since W is weakly relatively compact by assumption, W is bounded so that W̃ is too. Hence the Alaoglu theorem shows that {k} has a weak[formula]-accumulation point [formula] whose Lebesgue decomposition ψ  =  ψn  +  ψs ([\cite=Takesaki:Book1]) must satisfy ψs  ≠  0. Since all k's are positive, so is ψ and hence ψs|A  ≠  0 because ψs is also positive and ψs(1)  =  ||ψs||  ≠  0. Clearly ψ|A gives a weak[formula]-accumulation point of {φk} (⊆  W), and Lemma [\ref=L-2.1] shows the existence of a subsequence {φk(j)} so that [formula] is surjective, a contradiction to the weak relative compactness of W. (Indeed, the Eberlein-Smulian theorem enables us to find a subsequence {φk(j(l))} such that φk(j(l))(a) converges as l  →    ∞   for every a∈A. However, an element [formula] with αj(l): = ( - 1)l satisfies that αj(l) does not converge as l  →    ∞  .)

The next is a technical lemma. A key idea came to me by a conversation with Professor Masamichi Takesaki some years ago.

Let [formula] be the Hahn-Banach extension of a given [formula]. Then there exists a∈A with ||a||∞  ≤  1 such that φ(a)  =  ||φ||  =  ||||, and moreover such an element a∈A satisfies that   =  a*  ·  || and ||  =  a  ·  .

The existence of such a∈A is clear due to the Alaoglu theorem and the 'normality' of [formula]. Thus it suffices to show the latter half.

Let   =  v  ·  || be the polar decomposition in the sense of Sakai (see [\cite=Takesaki:Book1]). By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and v*v  ≤  1, aa*  ≤  1 one has ||||  =  (a)  =  ||(av)  ≤  ||(v*v)1 / 2||(aa*)1 / 2  ≤  ||(1)  =  ||||, and hence ||(av)  =  ||(v*v)1 / 2||(aa*)1 / 2. This implies that a* and v agree in the GNS Hilbert space associated with || so that a*  -  v∈{x∈M  |  ||(x*x)  =  0}  =  M(1 - s(||)), where s(||) denotes the support projection of ||. Hence a*  s(||)  =  v  s(||)  =  v thanks to v*v = s(||). Similarly, by using the right polar decomposition   =  (v  ·  ||  ·  v*)  ·  v one can show that a  s(v  ·  ||  ·  v*)  =  v*. Then the desired two equations immediately follow.

In what follows we define the absolute value |φ| for a given [formula] as the restriction of || to A, and write [formula] for a given subset [formula].

As saw in Remark [\ref=R-2.6] we have to follow a different path from many 'classical and commutative' proofs, see e.g. [\cite=Pelczynski:CBMS77]. The next lemma is a non-self-adjoint counterpart of [\cite=Sakai:IllinoisJMath65] and [\cite=Akemann:TAMS67], and we emphasize that our argument is more involved than those due to the non-self-adjointness. The lemma can also be regarded as a non-commutative counterpart of a result in [\cite=CnopDelbaen:JFA77] (also in [\cite=Konig:ArchMath83]), but our argument is technically more involved due to the non-commutativity.

Let {φk} be a sequence in [formula] with φk  →  0 in [formula]. Then, for each ε > 0 there exist δ > 0 and [formula] such that one has |φk(a)|  <  ε for all k  ≥  k0 and all a∈A with ||a||∞  ≤  1 and ||a||τ,2  <  δ, where ||a||τ,2: = τ(a*a)1 / 2.

Let [formula] thanks to the uniform boundedness principle. On contrary, we suppose that the desired assertion does NOT hold true. Namely, there are {aj} in the unit ball of A, ε > 0, and a subsequence {φk(j)} such that (i) ||aj||τ,2  →  0 as j  →    ∞   and (ii) |φk(j)(aj)|  ≥  ε for all j.

In the standard representation [formula] the 2-norm ||  -  ||τ,2 gives the strong operator topology on the unit ball of M so that the unit ball of A is complete with respect to ||  -  ||τ,2. Since φk(j)  →  0 in [formula] as j  →    ∞  , for a given ε > 0 the Baire category theorem enables us to find [formula], a0∈A with ||a0||∞  ≤  1 and δ > 0 in such a way that, for each a∈A with ||a||∞  ≤  1, one has: ||a - a0||τ,2  <  δ implies |φk(j)(a)|  <  ε / 8 for all j  ≥  j0. See the second paragraph of the proof of [\cite=Takesaki:Book1] for details.

Define

[formula]

where the 'Hilbert transform' of a given x∈M in the sense of [\cite=Randrianantoanina:JAustral98],[\cite=MarsalliWest:JOT98] is denoted by x~, an unbounded operator affiliated with M. Here we remark that ||aj||τ,2  ≠  0 thanks to (ii). As in the proof of [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] or more precisely by [\cite=Randrianantoanina:JAustral98], we observe that the bj and the cj are well-defined contractions in A. By the non-commutative Riesz theorem [\cite=Randrianantoanina:JAustral98],[\cite=MarsalliWest:JOT98] one has [formula] (n.b. |||aj|||∞  =  ||aj||∞  ≤  1). Similarly ||1 - cj||τ,2  ≤  2||aj||1 / 2τ,2. For any ζ∈bjH we have ||aj||- 1 / 2τ,2||ajζ||2τ,2  =  ||aj||- 1 / 2τ,2(|aj|2ζ|ζ)H  ≤  |(b- 1jζ|ζ)H|  ≤  ||b- 1jζ||τ,2||ζ||τ,2. Letting ζ: = bjξ with arbitrary ξ∈H we get ||aj||- 1 / 2τ,2||ajbjξ||2τ,2  ≤  ||ξ||τ,2||bjξ||τ,2  ≤  ||ξ||τ,2 so that ||ajbj||∞  ≤  ||aj||1 / 4τ,2. Similarly ||a*jcj||∞  ≤  ||aj||1 / 4τ,2. For any ζ in the domain of b- 1j one has [formula] so that [formula] for all ξ∈H. Consequently, we have constructed contractions bj,cj∈A, [formula], satisfying the following properties:

||1  -  bj||τ,2  ≤  2||aj||1 / 2τ,2, ||1  -  cj||τ,2  ≤  2||aj||1 / 2τ,2;

||ajbj||∞  ≤  ||aj||1 / 4τ,2, ||a*jcj||∞  ≤  ||aj||1 / 4τ,2;

[formula] for all ξ∈H.

For any ξ∈H with ||ξ||τ,2  ≤  1 we have

[formula]

since [formula] by (v). Hence, by (iv) and (i) one has [formula] as j  →    ∞  . Therefore, ||2- 1aj(1 - bj)  +  (1 - δ / 2)cja0bj||∞  ≤  1 for all sufficiently large j. By (iii) and (i) one has

[formula]

as j  →    ∞  . Similarly, ||(1 - δ / 2)cja0bj  -  a0||τ,2  ≤  4||aj||1 / 2τ,2  +  δ / 2  →  δ / 2 as j  →    ∞  . It follows that ||2- 1aj(1 - bj)  +  (1 - δ / 2)cja0bj - a0||τ,2  <  δ and ||(1 - δ / 2)cja0bj  -  a0||τ,2  <  δ for all sufficiently large j. Therefore, by what we prepared in the second paragraph we have, for all sufficiently large j,

[formula]

since |φk(j)(ajbj)|  ≤  ||φk(j)||  ·  ||ajbj||∞  ≤  C||aj||1 / 4τ,2 by (iv). Hence we have |φk(j)(aj)|  =  2|φk(j)(2- 1aj)|  ≤  2{C||aj||1 / 4τ,2 / 2  +  ε / 8  +  ε / 8}  =  C||aj||1 / 4τ,2  +  ε / 2 for all sufficiently large j so that by (i) lim sup j  →    ∞|φk(j)(aj)|  ≤  ε / 2, a contradiction to (ii).

Let X be a Banach space with predual [formula]. The Mackey topology on X (with respect to [formula]) is the weakest topology that makes all the seminorms [formula] with weakly relatively compact [formula] be continuous. Namely, a net {xλ} converges to x in the Mackey topology if and only if pW(xλ - x)  →  0 for any weakly relatively compact [formula]. Note that the Mackey topology is clearly stronger than the weak[formula]-topology [formula].

For any weakly relatively compact subset [formula], so is [formula].

Firstly, note that |W| is bounded since so is W. On contrary, suppose that |W| is NOT weakly relatively compact. Since [formula] has Peł czynski's property (V[formula]) due to [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] (also see Remark [\ref=R-2.2] in the present notes), there are a sequence {φk} (⊆  W), a wuC series [formula] in A and ε > 0 so that |φk|(bk)  ≥  ε for all k. By Lemma [\ref=L-2.4], |φk|  =  ak  ·  φk for some ak∈A with ||ak||∞  ≤  1. It is known, see [\cite=Takesaki:Book1], that the Mackey topology on M and the metric topology by ||  -  ||τ,2 agree on every bounded ball. Thus, by a well-known corollary of Schur's theorem (see [\cite=Pelczynski:CBMS77]) we observe that ||bk||τ,2  →  0 as k  →    ∞  , and hence ||bkak||τ,2  →  0 as k  →    ∞  . By the Eberlein-Smulian theorem one can find a subsequence {φk(j)} that converges to some [formula] in [formula]. Since [formula] is a wuC series and ||ak||∞  ≤  1, one can easily show that {bkak} is norm-bounded. Thus, Lemma [\ref=L-3.7] shows that |φk(j)(bk(j)ak(j)) - φ(bk(j)ak(j))|  →  0 as j  →    ∞  . It follows that ε  ≤  |φk(j)|(bk(j))  =  φk(j)(bk(j)ak(j))  ≤  |φk(j)(bk(j)ak(j)) - φ(bk(j)ak(j))|  +  |φ(bk(j)ak(j))|  →  0 as j  →    ∞  , a contradiction.

Here is the main theorem of this section.

For a subset [formula] the following conditions are equivalent:

W is weakly relatively compact.

[formula] is weakly relatively compact.

[formula] is weakly relatively compact.

[formula] is weakly relatively compact.

(1) ⇒   (3) is Corollary [\ref=C-2.8]. (3) ⇔   (4) follows from Corollary [\ref=C-2.3]. (2) ⇔   (4) is Kazuyuki Saitô's result [\cite=Saito:TohokuMathJ67]. Finally, (2) ⇒   (1) is trivial.

The next corollary is immediate from our main theorem.

The Mackey topology on A is the relative topology induced from that on M.

Supplementry Results

Semifinite Tracial Setup

In [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] we proved, among other things, that any finite tracial non-commutative H∞-algebra A = H∞(M,τ) has the unique predual [formula] and also satisfies a kind of F. & M. Riesz theorem which we have called the non-commutative F. & M. Riesz theorem in the present notes. As usual (see [\cite=Hensgen:MathScand96]), those results can easily be generalized to the semifinite tracial case.

Let M be a σ-finite von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal semifinite trace [formula]. A semifinite tracial non-commutative H∞-algebra [formula] is defined in the same manner with [formula] in place of a faithful normal tracial state τ as in the finite tracial setup. Due to the hypothesis, the restriction of [formula] to [formula] must be semifinite. Thus one can construct, by using e.g. [\cite=Takesaki:Book1], at most countable (due to the σ-finiteness) orthogonal projections {ei}∞i = 1 in D such that [formula] and [formula] for all i. Letting [formula] one has [formula] as m  →    ∞   and [formula] for all m. The next is a key simple lemma, which shows that questions on semifinite tracial [formula] can essentially be reduced to those on finite tracial ones.

For each m, Am: = pmApm is a non-commutative H∞-algebra H∞(Mm,τm) associated with Mm: = pmMpm and [formula].

The restriction of E to Mm  =  pmMpm gives a faithful normal conditional expectation from Mm onto [formula] since [formula], and also Em clearly preserves τm. It is clear that the restriction of Em to Am is multiplicative. Also, for each x∈Mm one has x∈M and x  =  pmxpm, and by the hypothesis, there is a net aλ  +  b*λ with aλ,bλ∈A such that aλ  +  b*λ  →  x σ-weakly so that pmaλpm  +  (pmbλpm)*  =  pm(aλ  +  b*λ)pm  →  pmxpm  =  x σ-weakly. Hence we are done.

With the above lemma and our previous result [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09], the proof of [\cite=Hensgen:MathScand96] works well for [formula] without any essential change.

[formula] has the property (X), and hence it is the unique predual of A.

The non-commutative F. & M. Riesz theorem also holds true for [formula].

Whenever [formula] annihilates A, the normal and the singular parts φn and φs annihilate A separately.

Our previous result [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] implies that [formula] and [formula] for all m since the normal and singular decomposition of the restriction of φ to Mm is clearly given by the simultaneous restriction of φ  =  φn  +  φs to Mm. By the normality of φn one has φn(a)  =   lim m  →    ∞φn(pmapm)  =  0 for any a∈A, and moreover φs(a)  =  φ(a)  -  φn(a)  =  0 for any a∈A.

The next corollary is immediate from the above proposition and Pfitzner's theorem [\cite=Pfitzner:Studia93].

[formula] is an L-embedded space. Hence it has the property (V[formula]).

The non-commutative Gleason-Whitney theorem can also be shown for [formula]. The part of 'automatic normality' immediately follows from Proposition [\ref=P-3.3], while the uniqueness part is shown in the same manner as in Remark [\ref=R-2.5].

A Hahn-Banach extension of each [formula] to the whole M is automatically normal and unique. Hence the quotient map from [formula] onto [formula] has a right inverse.

Moreover all the assertions in [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] still hold true in the semifinite tracial case. However we do not know whether or not the liftability of weakly relatively compact subsets in [formula] survives even in the semifinite setting, though Corollary [\ref=C-3.5] provides its basic prerequisite fact. Here it should be pointed out that Theorem [\ref=T-2.9] does never hold as it is, in the (non-finite) semifinite setting due to Kazuyuki Saitô's result [\cite=Saito:TohokuMathJ67]. Indeed, the equivalence (1) ⇔   (3) in Theorem [\ref=T-2.9] does not hold in the case of [formula] for example. In closing of this subsection we mention that it is an interesting question whether the results in [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] and in the present notes still hold true for any (not necessarily tracial) non-commutative H∞-algebra.

No Second Predual and Sequential Continuity of L-Projection

There are two properties on [formula] established in Ando's paper [\cite=Ando:CommentMath78] which remain to be discussed in the non-commutative setup. One is that [formula] has no second predual ([\cite=Ando:CommentMath78]) and the other is the weak[formula]-weak-sequential continuity of the L-projection from [formula] onto [formula] ([\cite=Ando:CommentMath78]). Those still hold true for any semifinite tracial [formula].

For the first properties it suffices to prove that the closed unit ball of the unique predual has no extreme point since the closed unit ball of the dual of any Banach space has a rich set of extreme points thanks to the Alaoglu and the Krein-Milman theorems. We begin with a simple lemma. A definitive result in the direction has been known (see e.g. [\cite=GuerreroMartin:JFA05]), but we do give a sketch for the reader's convenience because the work [\cite=GuerreroMartin:JFA05] deals with it in the framework of JBW*-triples.

If a semifinite von Neumann algebra M is diffuse (i.e., no minimal projection), then the closed unit ball of the predual [formula] has no extreme point so that M has no second predual.

(Sketch) Identify [formula] with the non-commutative L1-space [formula] equipped with the 1-norm [formula], see [\cite=PisierXu:Handbook03]. Let [formula] be a non-zero element, and h  =  v|h| be the polar decomposition. It is not hard to see that the relative commutant of the spectral measure of h in M is still diffuse, and hence one can find two non-zero projection p1,p2 in the relative commutant in such a way that p1 + p2 coincides with the support projection of h. Set [formula], i = 1,2, and one has [formula] since p1,p2 commute with |h| in a suitable sense. It immediately follows that the unit ball of [formula] does never have an extreme point.

The next is a non-commutative counterpart of the fact that [formula] is an L-embedded space (see e.g. [\cite=HarmandWerner^2:Book]).

The pre-annihilator [formula] of [formula] inside [formula] is an L-embedded space.

Let {φλ} be a net in [formula] that converges to [formula] in [formula]. Clearly, [formula] holds. Then φ is decomposed into the normal and singular part [formula] in the sense of Takesaki (see [\cite=Takesaki:Book1]). The non-commutative F. & M. Riesz theorem, i.e, Proposition [\ref=P-3.3] shows that [formula] and [formula]. Then, by Li's criterion (see e.g. [\cite=HarmandWerner^2:Book]) we get the desired assertion.

Combining the above two lemmas with [\cite=HarmandWerner^2:Book] we get:

The closed unit ball of the unique predual [formula] of [formula] has no extreme point if M is diffuse. Thus A has no second predual under the same hypothesis.

We should mention that Lemma [\ref=L-3.7] gives a more application. In fact, it follows that A and [formula] have the Daugavet property, see [\cite=GuerreroMartin:JFA05].

Next we discuss the weak[formula]-weak-sequential continuity of the L-projection from [formula] onto its L-summand [formula] with [formula]. We could give a direct proof to it in the finite tracial case by using only our Amar-Lederer type result [\cite=Ueda:MathAnn09] together with Pełczynski's trick, see Remark [\ref=R-3.10] below. After the previous version of these notes was circulated via the internet, Prof. Pfitzner communicated us that he could recently prove the weak[formula]-weak sequential continuity of the L-projection for any L-embedded space. Thus, his result [\cite=Pfitzner:ArchivderMath] and Corollary [\ref=C-3.4] imply:

The L-projection from [formula] onto [formula] with [formula] is weak[formula]-weak-sequentially continuous. In particular, the singular part [formula] is weak[formula]-sequentially complete.
