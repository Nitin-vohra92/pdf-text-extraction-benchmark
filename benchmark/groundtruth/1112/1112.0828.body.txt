Lower volume growth estimates for Self-shrinkers of mean curvature flow

Introduction

On a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold Mn with nonnegative Ricci curvature, there are two well known theorems on volume growth estimates of geodesic balls. One is the classic Bishop volume comparison theorem (see [\cite=L],[\cite=SY]) which says the geodesic balls have at most Euclidean growth, i.e., there exists some positive constant C such that

[formula]

holds for r > 0 sufficiently large. The other is a theorem proved by Calabi [\cite=Cal] and Yau [\cite=Yau] independently, which says the geodesic balls of such manifolds have at least linear volume growth, that is

[formula]

holds for some positive constant C.

In this paper, we consider the volume growth estimates on self-shrinkers. Note that there are many similarities between self-shrinkers and gradient shrinking solitons. Self-shrinkers give homothetically self-shrinking solutions to mean curvature flow, and describe possible blow ups at a given singularity of the mean curvature flow. While gradient shrinking Ricci solitons also correspond to the self-similar solutions to Hamilton's Ricci flow, and often arise as Type I singularity models.

Before we state our main theorem, we would like to give a roughly brief review about the already known results on volume growth of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons and self-shrinkers.

For an n-dimensional complete noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton (M,g,f) satisfying

[formula]

H. -D. Cao and D. Zhou [\cite=CZ] proved that it has at most Euclidean volume growth (see also [\cite=ChZ], [\cite=Z]). On the lower volume growth estimate, H.-D. Cao and X.P. Zhu [\cite=Cao] proved that any complete noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton must have infinite volume. In fact, they showed that there is some positive constant C such that (Bx0(r))  ≥  C ln  ln r for r sufficiently large. If the Ricci curvature is bounded, Carillo-Ni [\cite=CN] showed that the volume grows at least linearly. If the average scalar curvature satisfies

[formula]

for δ < n / 2 and r sufficiently large, then Cao-Zhou [\cite=CZ] showed that there exists some positive constant C such that (Bx0(r))  ≥  Crn - 2δ. In [\cite=MW] O. Munteanu and J. Wang proved the sharp result that every complete noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton has at least linear volume growth, which answered the question asked by Cao-Zhou ([\cite=CZ], [\cite=Cao]) and Lei Ni that if a Calabi-Yau type lower volume growth estimate holds complete noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci solitons.

Theorem A (Munteanu-Wang [\cite=MW]) Let (M,g,f) be a complete noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, then for any x0∈M there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

where Bx0(r) is the geodesic ball of M of radius r centered at x0∈M.

For a complete noncompact self-shrinker [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Lu Wang[\cite=W] proved that every entire graphical self-shrinker has polynomial volume growth. Then Q. Ding and Y. L. Xin [\cite=DX] generalized it and showed that if the immersion is proper, then the self-shrinker has at most Euclidean volume growth. After that, Cheng and Zhou [\cite=ChZ] improved Ding-Xin's result and gave a sharp volume growth estimate, they showed that (Bx0(r))  ≤  Crn - 2β, with β  ≤   inf |H|2, where the ball Bx0(r) is defined by

[formula]

with ρx0(x) = |X(x) - X(x0)| is the extrinsic distance function.

In this paper, we consider the lower volume growth estimates for complete noncompact self-shrinkers, an analogue Munteanu-Wang's result will be proved.

Let [formula] be a complete noncompact properly immersed self-shrinker, then for any x0∈M there exists a constant C > 0

[formula]

where the ball Bx0(r) is defined as [\eqref=I1-5].

Note that this is sharp because the volume of the cylinder self-shrinker [formula] grows linearly.

Preliminary

For a complete immersed self-shrinker [formula] satisfies [\eqref=1-3], we have

[formula]

Note that for a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton which satisfies [\eqref=1-1], we take the trace in [\eqref=1-1] and get

[formula]

The main idea of this paper is comparing the two equations [\eqref=2-1] and [\eqref=2-3], in fact, we can correspond |H|2 to R, and [formula] to f, then exploring the similarities between self-shrinker and gradient shrinking Ricci soliton.

Denote ρ(x) = |X|, we have

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Then by the co-area formula (cf. [\cite=SY]), we have

[formula]

Now we state the following Lemma:

Let [formula] be a complete noncompact properly immersed self-shrinker, then

[formula]

Integrate [\eqref=2-1] over B(r), we have by using [\eqref=1-3], [\eqref=2-2], [\eqref=eq2-4] -[\eqref=eq2-8]

[formula]

From the fourth equality in the above proof, we can get

[formula]

that is, the average of |H|2 is bounded by n / 2.

Let [formula] be a complete noncompact properly immersed self-shrinker, then

[formula]

Lemma 2.1 implies that

[formula]

Integrating the above equation from r2 to r1, we get

[formula]

Choose [formula], and let r1 > r2  ≥  r0. Since η(r) is nonnegative and nondecreasing in r, we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

where we used [\eqref=eq2-5] in the last inequality. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.

Let r2 = r0 and r = r1 sufficiently large in Lemma 2.2, we can obtain that

[formula]

Since Bx0(r)  ⊂  B(r + |X0|), we have

[formula]

for r  ≥  |X0|. This recovers Ding-Xin's result [\cite=DX], which states that every complete noncompact properly immersed self-shrinker has at most Euclidean volume growth.

In the last of this section, we recall the Logarithmic Sobolev inequality for submanifolds in Euclidean space, this was shown by K. Ecker in [\cite=Ec].

Let [formula] be an n-dimensional submanifold with measure dv, then the following inequality

[formula]

holds for any nonnegative function f for which all integrals are well-defined and finite, where C(n) is a positive constant depending on n.

On self-shrinker which satisfies [\eqref=1-3], the Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities [\eqref=LSI] implies the following two inequalities:

For any nonnegative function f which satisfies the normalization

[formula]

the following inequality

[formula]

holds.

By substituting [formula] into [\eqref=LSI], we have the following inequality

[formula]

holds for any nonnegative function u for which all the integrals are well-defined and finite.

Proof of Theorem 1.1

In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we need the following Lemma which holds for any complete properly immersed submanifold in Euclidean space.

Let [formula] be a complete properly immersed submanifold. For any x0∈M, r  ≤  1, if [formula] in Bx0(r) for some positive constant C > 0, where the ball Bx0(r) is defined as [\eqref=I1-5], then the following inequality holds

[formula]

here κ  =  ωne- C.

In Bx0(r) we have

[formula]

If [formula] in Bx0(r), then in Bx0(r) we have

[formula]

Integrating the above equation over Bx0(s) for s  ≤  r

[formula]

where the last equality is due to the co-area formula. This implies

[formula]

Integrating from ε > 0 to r, we have

[formula]

Let ε  →  0, by [formula], we have

[formula]

As pointed out to us by Ovidiu Munteanu, Lemma 3.1 also follows from Michael-Simon Sobolev inequality, see page 377 in [\cite=MS].

Next we will prove that every complete noncompact properly immersed self-shrinker has infinite volume, the argument in the following proof is an adoption of Cao-Zhu's [\cite=Cao] proof on that complete noncompact shrinking Ricci solitons have infinite volume.

Every complete noncompact properly immersed self-shrinker [formula] has infinite volume

We are going to show that if M has finite volume, then we shall obtain a contradiction to the Logarithmic Sobolev inequality [\eqref=2-8]. We denote the annulus region

[formula]

here ρ(x) = |X|. Since [formula] is complete noncompact properly immersed, X(M) cannot be contained in a compact Euclidean ball (R) with radius R <  +   ∞  . Then for k large enough, A(k,k + 1) contains at least 22k - 1 disjoint balls where ρxi(x) = |X(x) - X(xi)| is the extrinsic distance function. Noting that on self-shrinker

[formula]

thus by Lemma 3.1, each ball Bxi(r) has at least volume [formula], here κ  =  ωne- 1. So we have

[formula]

Suppose that (M) <  +   ∞  , then for every ε > 0, there exists a large constants k0 > 0 such that if k2 > k1 > k0, we have

[formula]

and we can also choose k1,k2 in such a way that

[formula]

In deed, we may first choose K > 0 sufficiently large, and let k1  ≈  K / 2, k2  ≈  3K / 2, suppose [\eqref=4-4] does not hold, i.e.,

[formula]

If

[formula]

then we are done, otherwise we can repeat this process, after j steps we get

[formula]

When j  ≈  K / 4, [\eqref=4-2] implies that But we have already assumed (M) is finite, so after finitely many steps [\eqref=4-4] must hold for some k2 > k1. Thus for any ε > 0 we can choose k1 and k2  ≈  3k1 such that both [\eqref=4-3] and [\eqref=4-4] are valid.

Now we are going to derive a contradiction to the Logarithmic Sobolev inequality [\eqref=2-8]. We define a smooth cut-off function ψ(t) by Then let

[formula]

we can choose L such that

[formula]

By the Logarithmic Sobolev inequality [\eqref=2-8] we have

[formula]

where we have used [formula] and the elementary inequality [formula] for 0  ≤  t  ≤  1. Then [\eqref=4-4] implies,

[formula]

where the last equality is due to [\eqref=4-5]. On the other hand, by [\eqref=4-3] [\eqref=4-5] and 0  ≤  ψ  ≤  1, we have

[formula]

So we can make L arbitrary large by letting ε > 0 sufficiently small, this contradicts with [\eqref=cn3-9] because C(n) is just a universal positive constant depending on n. Therefore M must have infinite volume.

In the paper [\cite=ChZ], Xu Cheng and Detang Zhou proved that if the self-shrinker is not properly immersed, then it must also have infinite volume.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.1.

We use the similar arguments of Munteanu-Wang's in their proof of Theorem A. First we can choose c > 0 such that V(r) > 0 for r  ≥  c. To prove Theorem 1.1, it suffices to show there exists a constant C > 0 depending only on n such that

[formula]

hold for all r  ≥  c. Indeed, if [\eqref=pf1] holds, then for [formula], since for r sufficiently large, this implies

[formula]

for r  ≥  2|X0|.

Now we are going to prove [\eqref=pf1] by contradiction. Assume that for any ε > 0, there exits r  ≥  c such that

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we can assume [formula] and consider the following set:

[formula]

Obviously D  ≠  Ø because r∈D, we want to prove that any integer k  ≥  r is in D.

For t  ≥  c, we define a function u by Substituting u(x) into the Logarithmic Sobolev inequaltiy [\eqref=LSI2], we obtain

[formula]

with [formula], here we have used [formula] and the elementary inequality [formula] for 0  ≤  t  ≤  1.

From Lemma 2.2, we have

[formula]

then

[formula]

This implies for t sufficiently large,

[formula]

So there exists some constant C1(n) such that for all t  ≥  C1(n),

[formula]

where 1 depending only on n. Combining [\eqref=pf2] and [\eqref=pf3] gives that for all t  ≥  C1(n) + 1,

[formula]

where C2 depending only on n. Note that we can assume r  ≥  C1(n) + 1 for the r satisfying [\eqref=pf7]. In fact, if for any give ε > 0, all the r which satisfies [\eqref=pf7] is bounded above by C1(n) + 1, then V(r)  ≥  εr holds for any r > C1(n) + 1, this implies M has at least linear volume growth.

Then for all integers r  ≤  t  ≤  k, we have t∈D, [\eqref=pf8] implies

[formula]

If we choose ε such that 2C2ε < 1, and noting that

[formula]

then [\eqref=pflog] implies

[formula]

Iterating from t = r to t = k and summing up give that

[formula]

where we used [\eqref=pf3] in the last inequality. Therefore

[formula]

We can choose ε small enough such that

[formula]

So [\eqref=pf4] implies

[formula]

Noting that r  ≤  k + 1, therefore [\eqref=pf5] implies k + 1∈D. Then by induction we conclude that D contains all the integers k  ≥  r. However [\eqref=pf5] implies

[formula]

This implies that M has finite volume, which contradicts with Lemma 3.2. So there exists no such r > c such that V(r)  ≤  εr with ε > 0 chosen in [\eqref=pf6]. That is V(r)  ≥  εr for r > c, and this completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.

By assuming some condition on |H|2, we can further prove the following result,

Let [formula] be a complete properly immersed self-shrinker. Suppose the average norm square of the mean curvature satisfies the upper bound

[formula]

for some [formula] and r sufficiently large . Then for any x0∈M, there exists some positive constant C such that

[formula]

Combining the assumption [\eqref=1-5] with Lemma 2.1 gives that

[formula]

then

[formula]

Integrating from 1 to r gives Since (Bx0(r))  ≥  V(r - |X0|) for r > |X0|, we have

[formula]

for r > 2|X0|.
