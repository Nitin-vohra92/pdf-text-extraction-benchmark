Astala's conjecture from the point of view of singular integrals on metric spaces

Introduction

Let us explain the setting. Let φ be a K-quasiconformal (QC) mapping, 0 < t < 2. Astala [\cite=A] proved the following celebrated

[formula]

where

[formula]

He asked whether for the borderline distortion one should have the absolute continuity of corresponding Hausdorff measures:

[formula]

The answer is "yes", it was proved in [\cite=LSUT], and one of the key point was the following theorem about weighted estimate of singular integral operators (SIO).

Let 0 < d < 2, and {Qm}Mm = 1 is a collection of dyadic squares on the plane such that it satisfy strong disjointness condition

[formula]

and a packing condition, which says that for any dyadic square Q of the same lattice

[formula]

Consider measure [formula] and the kernel [formula]. Then the operator with the kernel t(x,y) is bounded from L2(μ) to L2(μ) in the sense that ([formula])

[formula]

Remarks. 1) The proof of this result in [\cite=LSUT] is not too easy, and its mechanism is not obvious. Our goal in the present note is to clarify this mechanism.

2) We can write dμ  =  w  dm2 with the obvious [formula]. It is very easy to check that

[formula]

independently of the disc B on the plane. This, of course, suggests that the theorem above is a particular case of a classical Hunt-Muckenhoupt-Wheeden weighted A2 result. We warn the reader: this is not so at all. A very "tiny" difference is in integration over [formula] in [\eqref=A2]. It cannot be replaced by the integration over B, which practically always equal to infinity for w- 1. This tiny difference is crucial. It gives the idea that we need to stick to X, namely, it seems at the first glance that we need the Hunt-Muckenhoupt-Wheeden weighted A2 result on metric space X. However, at this moment there is no necessary and sufficient condition of the weighted type for singular integrals operators (SIO) on metric spaces. This problem is very close to a notoriously difficult two-weight problem for singular integrals. The difficulty is that we come into the realm of non-homogeneous Harmonic Analysis: meaning that neither m2|X, nor μ|X is a doubling measure. There are partial A2 type results in such situations, but only partial, see [\cite=NRV] for example.

3) This explains the subtlety of the proof in [\cite=LSUT].

4) However, we show below that the point of view of non-homogeneous Harmonic Analysis on metric spaces is fruitful and allows us to simplify the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. But strangely enough, we need to look at it as unweighted non-homogeneous T1 theorem (in fact, it turns out that the mechanism is even simpler, but for that the reader should look at Section [\ref=simple]).

A simple proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. The weighted estimate of Ahlfors-Beurling transform = unweighted estimate of a certain non-symmetric Calderón-Zygmund operator on a metric space.

Let

[formula]

Let us consider

[formula]

It is obvious that the boundedness of this operator in L2(μ) is exactly equivalent to proving Theorem [\ref=main].

We notice that it is enough to prove the boundedness for the formal adjoint operator T'μ, whose kernel is

[formula]

Consider any metric space with any measure (we do not need even (X,d) to be a geometrically doubling metric space), and let

[formula]

This maximal operator was widely used in [\cite=NTV]. It is an immediate consequence of Vitali's covering lemma that it is bounded in L2(μ), no matter what is μ.

Now we have Theorem [\ref=main] as an immediate corollary of

The operator [formula] is pointwise majorized by C  Mμ,3f(x).

Let f  ≥  0. Fix Qj, its center cj, x∈Qj, and let us estimate

[formula]

Consider the centers ci of squares Qi such that [formula]. We call this family of centers (and their squares too) family Fa. Notice that Fa can be non-empty only if a  ≥  2 (see [\eqref=D]).

If x∈Qj,y∈Qi,Qi∈Fa then

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The last inequality holds because each square from the family Fa lie in the disc centered at x∈Qj of radius [formula]. This is again obvious from [\eqref=D]. We continue:

[formula]

[formula]

The last inequality is because

[formula]

In its turn this is easy: the disc [formula] is covered by a fixed number of dyadic squares of comparable size. Apply the packing condition [\eqref=P] to each of these dyadic squares, and see [\eqref=meest] immediately. Theorem [\ref=main] is proved.

T1 theorem for non-homogeneous metric measure spaces

The current section is not needed for the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] because the proof has been already given in the previous section.

Still we decided to include it here to explain the connection to other related questions. Also this section serves as a conceptual explanation of what is going on in Theorem [\ref=main]. For the experts we want to emphasize a ceratin affinity to the problem considered in Volberg-Wick's paper [\cite=VW]. But the situation in [\cite=VW] is actually more singular so-to-speak.

Let us work in this section only with so-called geometrically doubling metric spaces (GDMS) (X,d) meaning that each ball of radius r can be covered by at most fixed number of balls of radius r / 2. This guarantees (by Konyagin-Volberg's theorem [\cite=KV]) that X is a metric measure space with measure σ, [formula], such that σ is a doubling measure ((X,d,σ) is sometimes called "homogeneous metric-measure space"). However, we need a non-homogeneous metric-measure space with the same underlying (X,d): namely, (X,d,μ), where μ is not necessarily doubling.

Given such (X,d,μ) with an extra condition

[formula]

we can consider singular kernel of singularity s of Calderón-Zygmund type on X. It is K(x,y),x,y∈X such that

I) |K(x,y)|  ≤  d(x,y)- s

II) [formula] for some ε > 0 and all x,x',y such that [formula].

III) [formula] for the same ε > 0 and all y,y',x such that [formula].

We can consider the (formal) operator Tμ.

[formula]

Given all this, we have the following theorem called non-homogeneous T1 theorem. It was proved by Nazarov-Treil-Volberg if X is a Euclidean spaces, but the same proof can be adapted for GDMS (and actually this has been done by Hytönen-Martikainen [\cite=HyMa]). Notice that the kernel actually can be allowed to be considerably worse (bigger) depending on μ than we list in I), II), III). See, for example, [\cite=HyMa], [\cite=NRV]. But we do not need this here.

In the next result we assume that formal operator Tμ and its formal adjoint T'μ can be correctly defined on characteristic functions of balls.

Operator Tμ with kernel K is bounded (can be extended to be a bounded operator from finite linear combinations of characteristic functions of balls) in L2(μ) if and only if

(i) [formula]

(ii) [formula]

where T'μ is a (formal) operator with kernel K(y,x).

Let us look at Lacey-Sawyer-Uriarte-Tuero's theorem [\ref=main] from the point of view of this theorem. The metric space is [formula], the metric d is the usual Euclidean metric, [formula]. What is K(x,y)? Of course it is not t(x,y) = (x - y)- 2.

Let us consider

[formula]

It is really a simple calculation to see

Let τ∈(0,1) be an arbitrary number, s: = 2 - d, ε: =  min (1,τd). Then thus defined K is a Calderón-Zygmund kernel on X with singularity s and Calderón-Zygmund parameter ε.

It is trivial to see I) and II) by using disjointness condition [\eqref=D]. To check III) one consider cases:

III.1) y,y' are in the same square, x is in a different square. This is easy again by [\eqref=D]. If x joins y,y' in their square there is nothing to prove as K becomes zero.

III.2) x,y are in the same square but y' is in a different one. Then [\eqref=D] and [formula] would imply that such situation is impossible. If x,y' are in the same square but y is in a different one. Then again [\eqref=D] and [formula] would imply that such situation is impossible.

III.3) x,y,y' are all in different squares. Let y∈Qi, y'∈Qi'. As [formula] and [formula] (by [\eqref=D]), we should think that squares Qi,Qi' are small with respect to |x - y|. Here we do not estimate the difference, we estimate |K(x,y) and |K(x,y')| separately:

[formula]

[formula]

Remark. The integral operator with kernel [formula] from Theorem [\ref=main] is exactly the sum of [formula] (we call attention of the reader to the change of measure!) plus the local operator [formula], where

[formula]

The boundedness of t0 in each [formula] (and, thus, in the direct sum of these spaces, which is precisely L2(X,μ)) is obvious as the constant [formula] just cancels out in norm estimate in the left and right hand sides, and operator with kernel [formula] is a classical (called Ahlfors-Beurling) operator, which is an isometry in L2(m2).

So, in principle, we could have checked assumptions (i), (ii) of our T1 theorem [\ref=T1] and then Theorem [\ref=main] would follow.

However, there is an even simpler way to see that the integral operator

[formula]

is bounded in L2(μ).
