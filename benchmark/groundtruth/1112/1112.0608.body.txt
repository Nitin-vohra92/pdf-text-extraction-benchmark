A note on the direct limit of increasing sequences of completely decomposable modules over integral domains

Introduction

In 1970, P. Hill established that an abelian group is free if it is the union of a countable, increasing sequence of free, pure subgroups [\cite=Hill]; with this result, Hill generalized a theorem previously proved by L. Pontryagin in 1934, which was valid only for countable groups [\cite=Pontryagin]. Evidently, many avenues of algebraic research opened after Hill's result, particularly in the theory of modules over domains, where abelian group theory finds a natural route of expansion. For instance, the literature reports on some generalizations of Hill's theorem to freeness and projectivity of modules over domains [\cite=Macias-PJM], to completely decomposable and separable modules [\cite=Fuchs-Macias] [\cite=Rangas], to modules which are direct sums of ideals of Prüfer domains [\cite=Macias-AC], and to Butler modules [\cite=Rangas]. However, most of these results impose restrictive conditions on the links of the countable chains and/or on the type of rings employed.

The present work establishes a generalization of Hill's theorem to completely decomposable modules over commutative, integral domains, which extends many of the results available in the literature on the topic. In particular, the main result of this note extends the version of Hill's theorem for completely decomposable modules presented in [\cite=Fuchs-Macias] [\cite=Macias-AC]. Section [\ref=S:Prelim] of this note quotes some notions from module theory, such as the conditions of complete decomposability and purity, and some fundamental class of families of modules. That stage is used to present some crucial lemmas in our investigation. Finally, we close our study with the statement and the corresponding proof of our main result.

Preliminaries

Once and for all, we state that all modules in this work will be over an arbitrary domain, that is, a commutative ring with identity and without zero divisors; for the sake of non-triviality, we assume explicitly that 1  ≠  0. Moreover, we will restrict our attention to torsion-free modules. A submodule N of a module M over a domain R is called pure if every system of equations where each ri,j∈R and ai∈N, has a solution in N whenever it is solvable in M. It is easy to see that every pure submodule N of M is also relatively divisible, that is, the identity [formula] is satisfied for every r∈R. In fact, the two conditions coincide for modules over Prüfer domains [\cite=Warfield] and, among integral domains, Prüfer domains are the only ones with such property [\cite=Cartan-Eilenberg].

By a completely decomposable module we mean a torsion-free module which is the direct sum of rank-one submodules. Evidently, every free module over a domain R is completely decomposable, and so are modules which are isomorphic to direct sums of ideals of R; in this sense, complete decomposability generalizes the notion of freedom in the category of R-modules (for elementary properties on purity, relative divisibility and complete decomposability of modules employed in this work without an explicit reference, we refer to [\cite=Fuchs-Salce2]).

A module M is completely decomposable if there exists a continuous, well-ordered, ascending chain

[formula]

of submodules of M, such that

for every ρ  <  σ, Nρ  +  1  /  Nρ is completely decomposable,

for every ρ  <  σ, the exact sequence 0  →  Nρ  →  Nρ  +  1  →  Nρ  +  1  /  Nρ  →  0 splits, and

[formula].

Under the hypotheses, M is isomorphic to the direct sum of the modules Nρ  +  1  /  Nρ for every ρ  <  σ, thus, it is completely decomposable.

Let κ be an infinite cardinal number, and let M be a module. By a G*(κ)-family of submodules of M we understand a family B of submodules of M satisfying the following properties:

0,M∈B,

B is closed under unions of ascending chains, and

for every H  ⊆  M of cardinality at most κ and every A0∈B, there exists A∈B containing both A0 and H, such that A  /  A0 has rank at most κ.

One immediately notices that every module has a [formula]-family of submodules, namely, the set of all its submodules. However, it is not true that every module has a [formula]-family consisting of pure submodules. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modules of projective dimension less than or equal to 1 over Prüfer domains with a countable number of maximal ideals (included valuation domains, obviously) do possess [formula]-families of pure submodules [\cite=Bazzoni-Fuchs] [\cite=Macias-PJM].

Every completely decomposable module M can be given an explicit [formula]-family consisting of pure submodules. To show this, let [formula] be a fixed, direct decomposition of M into rank-one, torsion-free modules. Then the collection of submodules of M defined by which consists of all the partial direct sums in the given decomposition of M, is one such family. Moreover, every member of B is evidently a completely decomposable module. Furthermore, given A,B∈B with A  ≤  B, it follows that B  /  A is completely decomposable.

For the remainder of the present section, we assume that M is a torsion-free module over a domain, for which there exists a continuous, well-ordered, ascending chain

[formula]

of submodules of M, satisfying the following properties:

every Mν is pure in M,

every Mν has a G*(κ)-family Bν consisting of pure submodules, and

[formula].

The following lemmas are the cornerstones of our investigation. For their proofs, see Section XVI.1 of [\cite=Fuchs-Salce2].

There exists a continuous, well-ordered, ascending chain

[formula]

of submodules of M, such that

for every α  <  τ and ν  <  κ, [formula],

for every α  <  τ, the factor module Aα  +  1  /  Aα has rank at most κ,

for every α  <  τ and ν  <  κ, [formula], and

[formula].

Departing from the previous lemma, the proof of the following result is easy. One should only mention that the modules in the ascending chain [\eqref=Eq:rho-Chain] described below, are actually the collection of modules [formula], for every α  <  τ and ν  <  κ, well ordered under set inclusion.

There exists a continuous, well-ordered, ascending chain [\eqref=Eq:rho-Chain] of submodules of M, such that

every factor module Nρ  +  1  /  Nρ has rank at most κ,

every factor module Nρ  +  1  /  Nρ is isomorphic to a factor module A  /  B, with both A and B in some family Bν and B  <  A, and

[formula].

Main result

The following is the most important result of this work. Clearly, it generalizes Hill's criterion of freeness of abelian groups, to a criterion for the complete decomposability of modules over domains.

A torsion-free module M over a domain is completely decomposable if there exists a countable, ascending chain

[formula]

of submodules of M, such that

every Mn is completely decomposable,

every Mn is pure in M, and

[formula].

For each n  <  ω, let Bn be the family consisting of all partial direct sums of modules in a fixed decomposition of Mn as a direct sum of rank-one submodules. Example [\ref=Ex:1] guarantees that such collection is a [formula]-family of pure submodules of Mn. Then, there exists a continuous, well-ordered, ascending chain [\eqref=Eq:tau-Chain] satisfying the properties (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Lemma [\ref=Lemma:2]. The modules [formula] with α  <  τ and n  <  ω, well-ordered under set inclusion, form a continuous, ascending chain [\eqref=Eq:rho-Chain] satisfying (a), (b) and (c) in Lemma [\ref=Lemma:3]. In particular, [\eqref=Eq:rho-Chain] satisfies (a) and (c) of Lemma [\ref=Lemma:1], and we only need to show that (b) also holds.

Recall that Nρ and Nρ  +  1 take on the form [formula] and [formula], respectively, for some α  <  t and n  <  ω. We have the following commutative diagram with exact rows and exact columns in which ι and [formula] are inclusion homomorphisms, and the isomorphism in the bottom row is the result of applying the modular law and the first isomorphism theorem to the factor module of the right: Properties (a) and (c) of Lemma [\ref=Lemma:2] state that [formula] and [formula] both belong in Bn  +  1, so that the first row splits. It follows that the sequence 0  →  Nρ  →  Nρ  +  1  →  Nρ  +  1  /  Nρ  →  0 splits and, thus, M is completely decomposable by Lemma [\ref=Lemma:1].
