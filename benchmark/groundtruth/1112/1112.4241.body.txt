On Some Double-Series Inequalities

Introduction

Let p > 0 and lp be the space of all complex sequences [formula] satisfying: A matrix A = (an,k) is said to be a weighted mean matrix if its entries satisfy: For fixed p > 1, the lp operator norm of A is defined as the p-th root of the best possible constant Up satisfying:

[formula]

where the estimate is to hold for all complex sequences [formula]. When λk = 1 for all k and Up = (p / (p - 1))p, inequality [\eqref=1.1] becomes the celebrated Hardy's inequality ([\cite=HLP]).

By the duality principle [\cite=M] for the norms of linear operators, inequality [\eqref=1.1] is equivalent to the following

[formula]

where q = p / (p - 1).

From now on we restrict our attention to all non-negative sequences (an). Similar to inequality [\eqref=1.2], one can also study the following inequality (or its reverse) for various p:

[formula]

When 0 < p < 1 and λk = 1 for all k, the reversed inequality [\eqref=1.3] becomes the one studied in Theorem 345 of [\cite=HLP]. The best possible constant Up in this case is not yet known for all 0 < p < 1. For studies in this direction, we refer the reader to the references [\cite=L&S] and [\cite=G9].

For fixed p, it is interesting to compare the right-hand side expressions in [\eqref=1.2] and [\eqref=1.3]. When λk = 1 for all k, one has the following result of Bennett and Grosse-Erdmann [\cite=BGE1]:

[formula]

Here 0 < p  ≤  1,0  ≤  β  <  1 / p and the constant is best possible.

More generally, for given matrices A,B, one can consider inequalities of the type

[formula]

where K(p) is a constant, and the estimate is to hold for all non-negative sequences [formula]. When neither A nor B is a diagonal matrix, we refer to inequality [\eqref=1.4] as double�-series inequality. The double-series inequalities are studied in [\cite=BGE1] and [\cite=Be2].

In this paper, we focus on the study of double-series inequalities given in the following form:

[formula]

Here (an,k),(bn) and (cn) are given non-negative sequences, 0 < p,q  <    ∞   are fixed parameters. The estimate is to hold for all non-negative sequences [formula]. The constant K(p,q) is independent of [formula].

We denote [formula] and so on. In Section [\ref=sec_3], we prove the following

Suppose that an,k / ck increases with k for any fixed n  ≥  1, then for p  ≥  1,0 < q  ≤  p, inequality [\eqref=1] holds for non-negative sequences x = (xk) if and only if it holds for [formula]. The theorem continues to hold when 0 < p  ≤  1,q  ≥  p provided that inequality [\eqref=1] is reversed.

When p = q, a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm2] is proved in [\cite=BGE1] while the general case is proved in [\cite=Be2].

Motivated by various choices for the λk's in [\eqref=1.3], we apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] in Section [\ref=sec_4] to determine the best possible constant K(p) with 0 < p < 1 in [\eqref=1.4] for various A and B.

Lemmas

In this section we list a few lemmas that are needed in the proofs of our results in Section [\ref=sec_4]. We first note the following lemma of Levin and Ste ckin [\cite=L&S]:

For an integer n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=4] reverses when r  ≥  1 or - 1 < r  ≤  0. Inequality [\eqref=201] reverses when - 1 < r  ≤  1.

For s > r >  - 1, n  ≥  1,

[formula]

The constant is best possible.

Upon letting n  →    ∞  , one sees easily that the constant is best possible. To prove inequality [\eqref=4.1], we rewrite it as Note that We want to show the above expression is non-negative, which is amount to showing For fixed r, it's easy to see that the right-hand side expression above is an increasing function of s > r so that it suffices to show

[formula]

As it's easy to see inequality [\eqref=3.1] follows from various cases of inequalities [\eqref=4] or [\eqref=201], it follows that f(n)  ≥  f(1) = s - r > 0 for all n  ≥  1 and this completes the proof.

For n  ≥  2,

[formula]

The constants are best possible.

We first consider the case s > r  ≥  1. Note that the case n = 2 implies the constant here is best possible. To prove the corresponding inequality, we rewrite it as: Note that We want to show the above expression is non-negative, which is amount to showing

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that for u > 0,1 / 2  ≤  v < 1, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

One sees easily that p(u;w) is a concave function of w for fixed u and it follows that p(u; ln v)  ≥   min (p(u; -  ln 2),p(u;0)) = 0 for 1 / 2  ≤  v < 1. We then deduce that in order to establish inequality [\eqref=4.5] for s  >  r  ≥  1, it suffices to show that

[formula]

As the above inequality is an easy consequence of the case r  ≥  1 of inequality [\eqref=4], we see that we have g(n + 1) - g(n)  ≥  0 for all n  ≥  2 and g(2) = 0, it follows that g(n)  ≥  0 for all n  ≥  2 and this completes the proof for the case s > r  ≥  1.

Next, we consider the case 0 > s > r >  - 1. Upon letting n  →    ∞  , one sees that the constant here is best possible. We prove the corresponding inequality by induction. When n = 2, the inequality follows easily from the fact that the function r  ↦  (1 + r)2- r is an increasing function of - 1 < r < 0.

Suppose now the corresponding inequality holds for some n with n  ≥  2, then we have It suffices to show that the right-hand side expression above is [formula], which is equivalent to the following

[formula]

where

[formula]

It's easy to see that for fixed 0 < v < 1, q(u;v) is an increasing function of u > 0. It follows that in order to establish inequality [\eqref=4.7'] for 0 > s > r >  - 1, it suffices to show that

[formula]

We now note the reversed inequality [\eqref=4] valid for - 1 < r  ≤  0 implies that

[formula]

Thus, it remains to show that

[formula]

The above inequality is easily seen to be valid by noting that - 1 < s < 0 and this completes the proof for the case 0 > s > r >  - 1.

Let {Bn}∞n = 1 and {Cn}∞n = 1 be strictly increasing positive sequences with B1 / B2  ≤  C1  /  C2. If for any integer n  ≥  1, Then Bn / Bn + 1  ≤  Cn  /  Cn + 1 for any integer n  ≥  1.

For 1  ≤  s < r < 1 / p,

[formula]

The constant (1 - sp) / (1 - rp) is best possible.

We note first that as we have

[formula]

it's easy to see that the constant (1 - sp) / (1 - rp) in [\eqref=4.11] is best possible.

We now prove inequality [\eqref=4.11] by induction. Note that when n = 1, this follows easily from the fact that the function r  ↦  rp / (1 - rp) is an increasing function of 0 < r < 1 / p.

Suppose now inequality [\eqref=4.11] holds for some n with n  ≥  1, then we have It suffices to show that the right-hand side expression above is [formula], which, after simplification, is equivalent to the following

[formula]

We note that inequality [\eqref=4.1] implies that for fixed n  ≥  1, the function

[formula]

strictly increases with r >  - 1. It follows that we have

[formula]

Thus, it remains to show that

[formula]

As it is easy to show that the function

[formula]

is an increasing function for fixed n, it follows that we only need to establish inequality [\eqref=4.12] with r replaced by 1 / p. After simplification, it is equivalent to the following inequality:

[formula]

In order to establish the above inequality, we first show that for any n  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

The case n = 1 of the above inequality can be easily established by observing that s  ≥  1. We now apply Lemma [\ref=lem3] to conclude that it remains to show for any n  ≥  1,

[formula]

The above inequality is equivalent to

[formula]

To establish the above inequality, we define for any function f(x) defined on the interval (0,1] and any integer n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Then a result [\cite=B&J] of Bennett and Jameson asserts that Rn(f) decreases(resp. increases) with n if f(x) is an increasing (resp. decreasing) function which is either convex or concave. This result applied to the function f(x) = xs - 1 leads immediately to inequality [\eqref=4.15].

We now conclude that in order to show inequality [\eqref=4.14], it remains to show that

[formula]

The above inequality is equivalent to

[formula]

which also follows from the above mentioned result of Bennett and Jameson applied to f(x) = x- sp.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]

Motivated by the proof of [\cite=BGE1], we show that Theorem [\ref=thm2] is a consequence of the following

Let 0  <  q  ≤  p  <    ∞   and p  ≥  1. Let [formula] be a non-negative matrix, (bk) be a non-negative sequence and let C  >  0. Then

[formula]

holds for all non-negative non-increasing sequences (xn) if and only if for all [formula],

[formula]

The theorem continues to hold when 0  <  p  ≤  q  <    ∞   and p  ≤  1 provided that inequalities [\eqref=2] and [\eqref=3] are reversed.

We may assume p  ≥  1,0 < q  ≤  p here as the proof for the other case is similar. We denote [formula] so that we have [formula], and that We can then recast inequality [\eqref=1] as

[formula]

where we set an,0 / c0 = 0. Note that by our assumption, an,k / ck increases with k for any fixed n  ≥  1, so that Now the assertion of Theorem [\ref=thm2] readily follows from Theorem [\ref=thm3].

Some Applications of Theorem [\ref=thm2]

In this section we look at some applications of Theorem [\ref=thm2]. All of our results in this section are motivated by (the reversed) inequality [\eqref=1.3] for 0 < p < 1. Thus we assume 0 < p < 1 throughout this section and let [formula] be any non-negative sequence. We first apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] with

[formula]

to see that

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem1] that we have the following

For 0 < p < 1, s < r < 1 / p, an  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

The constants are best possible.

Note that the first inequality in [\eqref=3.4] follows as we have plainly for k  ≥  n,r > s, n- s / k1 - s  ≤  n- r / k1 - r. Upon taking a1 = 1,ak = 0,k  ≥  2, one sees that the first inequality in [\eqref=3.4] is also best possible.

Next, we apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] with

[formula]

to see that

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem2] that we have the following

For 0 < p < 1, s < r < 1 / p, an  ≥  0, we have where

[formula]

The constant Cp,r,s is best possible.

Let an  ≥  0,0 < p < 1. For [formula], we have

[formula]

where Cp,α,β is defined as in [\eqref=4.9] and the constant is best possible.

We apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] with

[formula]

Note that the fact an,k / ck increases with k is an easy consequence of the Mean Value Theorem. Thus we obtain

[formula]

Note that by the Mean Value Theorem, we have

[formula]

where m < ξ < m + 1. It follows that

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=4.10] then follows from Theorem [\ref=thm5]. We further note that we have

[formula]

This shows that the constant in [\eqref=4.10] is best possible and this completes the proof.

Upon letting β  →  0+, we immediately obtain the following

Let an  ≥  0,0 < p < 1. For [formula], we have The constant is best possible.

Note that as ln (1 + 1 / k)  ≤  1 / k, we have the following

Let an  ≥  0,0 < p < 1. For [formula], we have The constant is best possible.

We now consider an analogue of inequality [\eqref=4.10] by taking

[formula]

Then it follows from Theorem [\ref=thm2] that

[formula]

We recall that for two positive real finite sequences [formula] and [formula], [formula] is said to be majorized by [formula] if for all convex functions f, we have

We write [formula] if this occurs and the majorization principle states that if (xj) and (yj) are decreasing, then [formula] is equivalent to

[formula]

We refer the reader to [\cite=B&B] for a simple proof of this.

Now suppose 0 < β  <  α  ≤  1, we apply the majorization principle to the convex function - xp and the two sequences

[formula]

It's easy to see that both [formula] and [formula] are decreasing and [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

As the above inequality becomes an identity when m = 1, we obtain the following

Let an  ≥  0,0 < p < 1. For 0 < β  <  α  ≤  1, we have The constant is best possible.

Now, we apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] with

[formula]

to see that

[formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem4] that we have the following

For 0 < p < 1, 1  ≤  s < r < 1 / p, an  ≥  0, we have The constant is best possible.

We end this paper by considering an analogue to the above result. We apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] with

[formula]

to see that (note that the fact an,k / ck increases with k follows from a simple application of Lemma [\ref=lem3])

Suppose now s < r  ≤  1, we apply the majorization principle again to the convex function - xp and the two sequences

[formula]

It's easy to see that both [formula] and [formula] are decreasing and [formula] (for example, by an application of Lemma [\ref=lem3]). It follows that

[formula]

As the above inequality becomes an identity when m = 1, we obtain the following

Let an  ≥  0,0 < p < 1. For s  <  r  ≤  1, we have The constant is best possible.
