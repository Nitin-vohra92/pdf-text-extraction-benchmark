Antisymmetric tensor unparticle and the radiative lepton flavor violating decays

Physics Department, Middle East Technical University Ankara, Turkey

The radiative lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays li  →  ljγ reach great interest since their branching ratios (BRs) in the framework of standard model (SM) are much below the experimental upper limits, and, therefore, they are candidates to search and to test more fundamental models beyond. The current experimental upper limits of the BRs read BR (μ  →  eγ) = 2.4  (1.2)  ×  10- 12  (10- 11)  (    90%CL) [\cite=MEG] ([\cite=Brooks]), BR (τ  →  eγ) = 3.3  ×  10- 8  (    90%CL) [\cite=Aubert] and BR (τ  →  μγ) = 4.4  ×  10- 8  (    90%CL) [\cite=Aubert]. There is an extensive theoretical work in the literature in order to enhance BRs of these decays. They were studied in the SM with the extended Higgs sector, so called two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) [\cite=Iltan1]-[\cite=IltanLFVRS], in supersymmetric models [\cite=Barbieri1]-[\cite=Khalil], in a model independent way [\cite=Chang], in the framework of the 2HDM and the supersymmetric model [\cite=Paradisi], in the SM including effective operators coming from the possible unparticle effects [\cite=MuLinYan]-[\cite=AndiHektor], in little Higgs models [\cite=Illana]- [\cite=Aguila], in seesaw models [\cite=GangHe] -[\cite=Deppisch], in models with A(4) and S(4) flavor symmetries [\cite=Ding], using the effective field theory with Higgs mediation [\cite=Aranda], in the Higgs triplet model [\cite=Akeroyd], in the framework of Higgs-induced lepton flavor violation [\cite=Goudelis].

In the present work, we consider the contribution of the antisymmetric tensor unparticle mediation to the BRs of the radiative LFV decays (see [\cite=Tae] for the contribution of the antisymmetric tensor unparticle mediation to the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, to the electroweak precision observable S, its effects in Z invisible decays and see [\cite=IltanTensUnp] for the contribution of the antisymmetric tensor unparticle mediation to the lepton electric dipole moment). Unparticles [\cite=Georgi1] [\cite=Georgi2], being massless due to the scale invariance and having non integral scaling dimension dU around the scale ΛU  ~  1.0  TeV, come out with the interaction of SM-ultraviolet sector at some scale MU:

[formula]

where dUV is the scaling dimension of the UV operator [\cite=BankZaks]. Around the scale ΛU the effective interaction becomes [\cite=Rajaraman]

[formula]

Here OSM,i is type i SM operator, n is its scaling dimension and Λn is the mass scale (see [\cite=Tae] [\cite=Rajaraman] for details) which reads

[formula]

The antisymmetric tensor unparticle mediation induces these LFV decays at tree level and we consider the case that the scale invariance is broken at some scale μ after the electroweak symmetry breaking (see for example [\cite=PJFox] [\cite=Kikuchi] for a possible interaction which causes that scale invariance is broken). The effective lagrangian [\cite=Tae] which can drive the radiative LFV decays is

[formula]

where li(j) is the lepton field, H is the Higgs doublet, g and g' are weak couplings, λB, λW and λij are the unparticle-field tensor and unparticle-lepton-lepton couplings, Bμν is the field strength tensor of the U(1)Y gauge boson with Bμ = cW  Aμ + sW  Zμ and Waμν, a = 1,2,3, are field strength tensors of the SU(2)L gauge bosons with W3μ = sW  Aμ - cW  Zμ and Aμ (Zμ) is photon (Z boson) field. The couplings yij are responsible for the LF violation and after the electroweak symmetry breaking we introduce modified couplings [formula] which respect the mass hierarchy of charged leptons. The process li  →  ljγ appears in the tree level with the communication of two vertices [formula] and [formula], by the antisymmetric tensor unparticle propagator (see Appendix and eq.([\ref=propagatormu])) and the matrix element of this process reads

[formula]

where

[formula]

Finally the decay width Γ(li  →  ljγ) becomes

[formula]

where mi is the mass of incoming lepton. Notice that, in this expression, we ignore the mass of outgoing one. Discussion

In this section we study the intermediate antisymmetric tensor unparticle contribution to the radiative LFV decays li  →  ljγ which exist at tree level (see Fig.[\ref=fig1]). There are various free parameters in this scenario and we restrict them by using the current experimental upper limits of BRs of LFV decays. Now, we would like to present the free parameters and discuss the restrictions predicted. The SM sector interacts with the UV one and it appears as unparticle sector at a lower scale. The corresponding UV (unparticle) operator OUV (OU) has the scaling dimension dUV (dU) which is among the free parameters. We choose the scale dimension dU in the range 1 < dU < 2. Notice that the scale dimension must satisfy dU > 2 for antisymmetric tensor unparticle in order not to violate the unitarity [\cite=Grinstein]. Our assumption is based on the fact that the scale invariance is broken at some scale μ and one reaches to the particle sector. This results in a relaxation on the values of dU and we choose dU in the range 1 < dU < 2 so that the propagator for particle sector is obtained when dU tends to one. Furthermore we choose the numerical value of dUV as dUV = 3 which satisfies dUV > dU (see [\cite=Rajaraman]). The SM-ultraviolet sector interaction scale MU, the SM-unparticle sector interaction scale ΛU and the scale μ which is the one that scale invariance is broken belong to the free parameter set of the present scenario. Here we choose μ  ~  1.0  GeV and predict the restrictions for the others by using the experimental upper limits of LFV decays. Finally, for the couplings λB, λW and λij we consider λB  =  λW  =  λij = 1 and for ξij we respect the mass hierarchy of charged leptons, namely we choose ξτμ  >  ξτe  >  ξμe and we take ξτμ = 0.1  GeV, ξτe = 0.01  GeV and ξμe = 0.001  GeV in our numerical calculations.

In Fig.[\ref=muegrt0001Mmu], we present the BR(μ  →  e  γ) with respect to the mass scale MU for [formula]. Here, the solid (long dashed-short dashed) line represents the BR for dU = 1.7  (1.8 - 1.9). We observe that the BR is sensitive to the mass scale MU especially for the large values of the scale dimension dU and it decreases almost three orders in the range of 2000  GeV  <  MU  <  10000  GeV. The experimental upper limit is reached for dU  ~  1.8  (1.9) and MU  ~  8000  (4500)  GeV. Fig.[\ref=muegrt0001du] is devoted to the BR(μ  →  e  γ) with respect to the scale parameter dU for rU = 0.1. Here the solid (long dashed-short dashed-dotted) line represents the BR for MU = 3000  (5000 - 8000 - 10000)  GeV. The BR strongly depends on dU and decreases with the increasing values of dU. The experimental upper limit is observed in the range of dU  ~  1.78 - 1.88 for MU  ~  5000 - 10000  GeV.

In Fig.[\ref=muegrtdu] we show the parameter rU with respect to dU for BR(μ  →  e  γ) = 2.4  ×  10- 12. Here the solid (long dashed-short dashed) line represents rU for MU = 5000  (8000 - 10000)  GeV. We see that the scale dimension dU and rU can take values in the range 1.73 - 1.90 and 0.05 - 0.12, respectively for MU = 5000  GeV. For MU = 10000  GeV we have the range 1.65 - 1.9 for dU and 0.05 - 0.20 for rU.

Fig.[\ref=mtauegrt01and05Mmu] represents the BR(τ  →  e  γ) with respect to the mass scale MU. Here, the solid (long dashed-short dashed-dotted) line represents the BR for rU = 0.1, dU = 1.3 (rU = 0.1, dU = 1.4-rU = 0.5, dU = 1.6-rU = 0.5, dU = 1.7). It is observed that the sensitivity of the BR to the mass scale MU increases with the increasing values of the ratio rU. The experimental upper limit is reached for rU = 0.1 and dU  ~  1.3 when the mass scale MU reads MU  ~  4000  GeV. For rU = 0.5 one reaches the experimental limit in the case of dU  ~  1.6 and MU  ~  4000  GeV. Fig.[\ref=mtauegrt01and05Mmu] shows the BR(τ  →  e  γ) with respect to the scale parameter dU for rU = 0.1. Here the solid (long dashed-short dashed) line represents the BR for MU = 2000  (5000 - 10000)  GeV. The BR strongly depends on dU and decreases with the increasing values of dU similar to the μ  →  e  γ decay. One reaches the experimental upper limit in the range of dU  ~  1.26 - 1.32 for MU  ~  2000 - 10000  GeV.

Fig.[\ref=mtauegrtdu] is devoted to the parameter rU with respect to dU for BR(τ  →  e  γ) = 3.3  ×  10- 8. Here the solid (long dashed-short dashed) line represents rU for MU = 5000  (8000 - 10000)  GeV. This figure shows that the experimental upper limit is reached for MU = 5000  GeV if the scale dimension dU and rU can take values in the range 1.10 - 1.68 and 0.05 - 1.00, respectively. For MU = 10000  GeV we have the range 1.10 - 1.64 for dU and 0.05 - 1.00 for rU.

In Fig.[\ref=taumugrt01Mmu], we present the BR(τ  →  μ  γ) with respect to the mass scale MU for rU = 0.1. Here, the solid (long dashed-short dashed-dotted) line represents the BR for dU = 1.4  (1.5 - 1.6 - 1.7). We observe that the BR decreases more than one order in the range of 2000  GeV  <  MU  <  10000  GeV. The experimental upper limit is reached for dU  ~  1.4 and MU  ~  9000  GeV. Fig.[\ref=taumugrt01du] represents the BR(τ  →  μ  γ) with respect to the scale parameter dU for rU = 0.1. Here the solid (long dashed-short dashed) line represents the BR for MU = 2000  (5000 - 10000)  GeV. The experimental upper limit of the BR is observed in the range of dU  ~  1.38 - 1.47 for MU  ~  2000 - 10000  GeV.

In Fig. [\ref=taumugrtdu] we show the parameter rU with respect to dU for BR(τ  →  μ  γ) = 4.4  ×  10- 8. Here the solid (long dashed-short dashed) line represents rU for MU = 2000  (5000 - 10000)  GeV. We see that the scale dimension dU and rU can take values in the range 1.48 - 1.80  (1.3 - 1.8) and 0.10 - 0.55  (0.05 - 1.00), respectively for MU = 2000  (5000)  GeV. For MU = 10000  GeV we have the range 1.30 - 1.75 for dU and 0.05 - 1.00 for rU.

As a summary, the BRs of radiative LFV decays are sensitive to the mass scale MU especially for the large values of the scale dimension dU and this sensitivity increases with the increasing values of the ratio rU. The experimental upper limit of the BR(μ  →  e  γ) can be reached for rU  ~  0.1, dU  >  1.7 and for larger values of MU, namely MU  ~  7000 - 9000  GeV. For BR(τ  →  e  γ) one reaches the experimental upper limit for rU  ~  0.1, dU  ~  1.3 and MU  >  2000  GeV . If we consider the τ  →  μ  γ decay the experimental upper limit of BR is obtained for rU  ~  0.1, when dU is in the range dU  ~  1.4 - 1.5 and MU  >  2000  GeV. We see that the free parameters of this scenario are more restricted if the μ  →  e  γ decay is considered. However the future more accurate measurements of the upper limits of the LFV decays make it possible to obtain a more restricted range for the free parameters of this scenario and they stimulate to search the role and the nature of unparticle physics which is a candidate to drive the lepton flavor violation. Appendix The scalar unparticle propagator reads [\cite=Georgi2] [\cite=Cheung2]

[formula]

where the factor AdU is

[formula]

Now the tensor unparticle propagator is obtained by using the projection operator Πμναβ

[formula]

with the transverse and the longitudinal parts

[formula]

where PTμν = gμν - pμ  pν  /  p2 (see for example [\cite=Tae] and references therein) and the propagator of antisymmetric tensor unparticle becomes

[formula]

On the other hand the propagator is modified if the scale invariance broken at a certain scale and this modification is model dependent. Following the the simple model [\cite=PJFox] [\cite=ARajaraman] [\cite=ADelgado] we take

[formula]

where μ is the scale that the scale invariance broken and the particle sector comes out.
