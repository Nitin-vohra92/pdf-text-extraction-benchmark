Comment on "Magnetic-Field-Tuned Quantum Phase Transition in the Insulating Regime of Ultrathin Amorphous Bi Films"

A recent Letter by Lin and Goldman [\cite=Lin11] presented experimental data for the relative magnetoresistance (MR) in disordered thin films, which were interpreted as evidence of a quantum phase transition. Such films are known to exhibit a superconductor (SC)-insulator transition as a function of disorder [\cite=GoldmanReview], and a huge peak in the resistance R(B) with magnetic field B [\cite=MRold] [\cite=MRmore]. These highly disordered samples were insulating at zero B. The experimental results supporting the quantum phase transition scenario are: (a) the relative magnetoresistance, MR(B,B0)   =    / R(B0), at B0   =   0 was temperature (T) independent at a specific, non-universal, field [formula], and (b) near this point all the different-T curves collapsed upon rescaling [formula], where ν and z were interpreted as the critical exponents of the transition. In this comment we present an alternative interpretation based on activated transport in a disordered landscape. We first present numerical simulations, and then support them by simple analytic arguments.

Our numerical simulations were performed using a new ab initio technique, based on the disordered negative-U Hubbard model, that fully captures the effects of thermal phase fluctuations [\cite=ConduitMeir10]. The results of this method describe the observed phenomenology of transport through thin disordered SC films, including the origin of the magnetoresistance peak [\cite=ConduitMeir11]. Here we report results for more disordered systems, which, as in the experiment, are resistive at zero B (we used an onsite energy standard deviation of W   =   6t, where t is the lattice hopping integral, onsite interaction U   =   1.6t, and 0.37 filling). The inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:BPlots](b) depicts R(B) for several temperatures, with the resulting MR shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:BPlots](a), where the main experimental result is reproduced - following a peak, the MR isotherms cross at a constant magnetic field. Near that point, all the curves collapse (Fig. [\ref=fig:BPlots]b), using the same scaling analysis as in [\cite=Lin11], with νz   =   0.89. The sample displays no notable phenomenon in the local currents and chemical potential at [formula].

Since our numerical calculations neglect quantum fluctuations, the source of our crossing point [formula] cannot be the putative quantum phase transition [\cite=Lin11]. To understand the crossing we note that both in the theory and in the experiment, the resistance is activated, [formula], with [formula] the activation temperature at field B, and R0(B)   ≈   h / 4e2 is the high temperature resistance. Fig. [\ref=fig:BPlots](a) shows that [formula], in agreement with experiment, is a non-monotonic function, and, in fact, [formula] corresponds to [formula]. If R(B,T) obeys the activated behavior above, MR(B,0) becomes T-independent at [formula]. Moreover, expanding [formula] around [formula], we find that the scaling function

[formula]

is in agreement with the experimental fitted form with νz = 1. (The deviations from perfect scaling come from the weak dependence of R0(B) on B, and from the deviations, both experimentally and numerically, from simple activation at lower temperatures.)

If our interpretation is correct, and [formula] was only determined by [formula], the same behavior should be observed in less disordered samples for MR(B,B0), where [formula] and B0   >   0. Indeed in Fig. [\ref=fig:BPlots](c,d) we present results for a sample with lower disorder W   =   t that is SC at B   =   0. Again the MR isotherms all cross at [formula], with a reasonable collapse. Moreover the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:BPlots](d) depicts the excellent collapse of the experimental data published in Ref.[\cite=MRold] for a lower disorder sample, with [formula] and [formula], supporting our scenario.

In summary, using ab initio simulations and analytic arguments, we have demonstrated an alternative explanation of the experimental results of Ref. [\cite=Lin11]. The crossing of the MR curves can be understood entirely in terms of activated transport, which our previous analysis attributed to transport through Coulomb blockade islands [\cite=ConduitMeir11]. Finally, we have made a specific prediction to test our analysis.
