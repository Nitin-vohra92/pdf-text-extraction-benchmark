1. In 2-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics of incompressible fluid, point vortices play an exceptionally important role. Actually, point vortices are the well-defined quasiparticles. This means that various flows of ideal fluid can be represented as movements induced by a system of interacting point vortices [\cite=ref1], [\cite=ref19]. Certain restrictions of this point of view are discussed, in particular, in [\cite=ref2]. It is well known that the dynamics of three point vortices is regular while four or more point vortices dynamics is chaotic [\cite=ref3], [\cite=ref4], [\cite=ref8], [\cite=ref20]. The generalization of such point vortices on sphere or in isolated areas was already done by some authors [\cite=ref5], [\cite=ref6], (see also [\cite=ref19],[\cite=ref16]). Point vortices are also used for two-dimensional turbulence models [\cite=ref7]-[\cite=ref10] and for studies of 2D turbulence spectra. The nature of vortices interaction and features of statistically stationery states generation are essential [\cite=ref11], [\cite=ref12], as well as the nature of singular velocity field, induced by point vortices movements [\cite=ref13]. Besides, point vortices engender more complicated solutions of 2D Euler equation and magnetic fields configuration in MHD [\cite=ref14], [\cite=ref14a] [\cite=ref15]. In this paper, we will show that 2D Euler equation has exact solutions with more complicate singularities, such as a set of point vortex dipoles. Any finite sum of sets of point vortex dipoles and of point vortices is also an exact solution for 2D Euler equation with the moving singularities. Motion equations for a system of interacting vortices and point dipoles have been obtained. It is shown that these equations are Hamiltonian ones and have three motion integrals in involution.

2. In this part, we are going to obtain motion equations of different kind of one-dimensional singularity for two-dimensional Euler equations. Let us start with two-dimensional case of Euler equation for incompressible fluid:

[formula]

[formula]

Now we shall use the potential φ of velocity field [formula], which is defined as:

[formula]

Here i = 1,2 and εik is a unit antisymmetric tensor. After excluding pressure we shall consider a well known form of Euler equation:

[formula]

Here Δ is two-dimensional Laplace operator, and [formula] is Poisson's bracket. From physical point of view, this means the freezing of vorticity field ω into the fluid. Now the vorticity ω can be defined as:

[formula]

Let us suppose, that vorticity field singularities can be defined in terms of generalized functions as:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In other words, vorticity field is represented as a sum of point multipoles and point vortices. Greek indexes in the right part numerate the corresponding objects. The first sum corresponds to point vortices; Γα is vortex stretch and [formula] is the coordinate of α-th vortex. The second sum corresponds to point dipoles; Dβm(t) is dipole moment and [formula] is the coordinate of β-th point dipole. The next contributions correspond to multipoles of a higher order, e.g. μγi1i2(t) is quadrupole moment (symmetric traceless tensor) and [formula] is the coordinate of γ-th point quadrupole. The sense of the designation is the same as described above.

It is easy to obtain the explicit form of the potential from equation ([\ref=eq5])

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The main problem is to find under which conditions the equation ([\ref=eq6]) will be compatible with Euler equation ([\ref=eq3]). In order to solve this problem, we have to substitute the development ([\ref=eq6]) directly into Euler equation ([\ref=eq3]). Such substitution of the equations ([\ref=eq5]) and ([\ref=eq6]) into equation ([\ref=eq3]) leads to the following:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here Vi means the components of velocity field calculated with equations ([\ref=eq6]) and ([\ref=eq2]). To make it less bulky, we shall write down the dipole and quadrupole contributions only. There is no special difficulties in taking into account the contributions of higher order multipoles. Let us note that δ- functions in the equation ([\ref=eq7]) are the functions of both t, and [formula]. Now we shall deal with equation ([\ref=eq7]) using properties of the generalized functions. In particular, the following well known properties of δ - functions derivatives will be very important (see, for example, [\cite=ref17],[\cite=ref18]):

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

When using these relations, we can obtain δ - functions derivatives coefficients, depending only on time. Then, the equation ([\ref=eq7]) takes the form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq10]) we can obtain the motion equation for interacting singularities and the evolution equations for multipole moments. In order to do it, we need to have all the coefficients equal to zero before different δ - functions derivatives independently. If all these equations are compatible, then the velocity field, generated by potential ([\ref=eq6]), is the exact generalized solution of two-dimensional Euler equation. It is easy to see that if coefficients before generalized functions relative to vortexes and dipoles tend to zero, then it gives vortex and dipoles motion equations only, as well as evolution law for dipole moment. Further, it will be shown that equations of this set are compatible. But the situation is getting substantially different starting from the quadrupole vortices. As a matter of fact, higher order multipole moments give a set of uncompatible equations. In general case, the compatibility conditions are satisfied only, if higher order multipole moments starting from quadrupole one, are zero. Hence, in two-dimensional hydrodynamics only sets of point vortices and point dipoles give generalized point solutions. Let us note that singularities motion equations have natural physical meaning of the vorticity freezing into medium motions. Thus, the motion velocity of a chosen singularity coincides with the medium velocity in the same point, induced by all other singularities. From mathematical point of view, the selfinteraction is absent in motion equations for dipole singularities as well as for point vortices. Unlike point vortices when vortex stretch is constant, the dipole moment is function of time. Let us give now the final equations for evolution of interacting point vortices and point dipoles:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq11]) for zero values of dipole moment coincide exactly with equations for point vortices [\cite=ref1]. Equations ([\ref=eq11])-([\ref=eq13]) give a set of compatible equations, describing the evolution of interacting N - point vortices and M - point dipoles. The set of equations (([\ref=eq12])-([\ref=eq13]) for [formula], describes the evolution of M - points dipoles.

3. Let us consider now some general properties of equations ([\ref=eq11]-[\ref=eq13]). First of all this system is Hamiltonian with the following Hamiltonian:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

First group of terms is a usual interaction energy of point vortices, the second group is vortexes and dipoles interaction energy, and the third one is dipoles-dipoles interaction. Motion equations ([\ref=eq11]-[\ref=eq13]) have the following Hamiltonian form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is well known that for vortices, conjugated canonical variables are its coordinates. For point dipoles, conjugated canonical variables are dipole moments and dipole coordinates. The set of equations ([\ref=eq15]-[\ref=eq17]) has some integrals of motion, which are easy to check by direct calculation:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

These conservation laws are, in a sense, quite similar to the conservation laws, known for point vortices systems. Of course, the energy of point vortices and point dipoles system is conserved, so H = const.

The set of equations ([\ref=eq15]-[\ref=eq17]) can be written in a more symmetric way with the Poisson's bracket:

[formula]

[formula]

Then the Hamilton equations take the canonical form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using Poisson's bracket ([\ref=eq21]), we can check, that only three from the above mentioned invariants are in involution.

Actually, for four above mentioned motion integrals, one can get:

[formula]

besides, we obtain :

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In other words, these integrals are not in involution. We can find by the use of Poisson's bracket that

[formula]

[formula]

Then, the first three motion integrals are in involution H,J,I21 + I22. A particular case of these conservation laws for a system of vortices is well-known [\cite=ref1],[\cite=ref5]. According to Liouville's theorem, this means that one point vortex interacting with one point dipole constitute a completely integrable system. Let us remind that for the same reason, the system of three point vortices is also completely integrable [\cite=ref19] [\cite=ref20].
