Introduction

We work over the complex number field [formula]. One of the fundamental questions in birational geometry has been to find an optimal integer rn > 0 (n  ≥  3) such that the pluricanonical map φm is birational onto the image for all m  ≥  rn and for all n-dimensional nonsingular projective varieties of general type. It is well-known that r1 = 3 and, due to Bombieri, r2 = 5. For 3-folds, one has r3  ≤  73 by Chen-Chen [\cite=Ex1] [\cite=JDG]. For all n  ≥  3, the remarkable boundedness theorem, i.e. rn <  +   ∞  , was proved separately by Hacon-McKernan [\cite=H-M], Takayama [\cite=Tak] and Tsuji. One may refer to the very nice survey article [\cite=HM10] for other boundedness results in birational geometry.

We refer to [\cite=H-M] [\cite=Tak] [\cite=Joro] for those standard notions of "volume", "lc center" and "Nklt(X,D)". In this paper we are mainly interested in the explicit boundedness of projective varieties with large volumes.

Utilizing the effective induction on non-klt centers (i.e. [formula]) developed in Hacon-McKernan [\cite=H-M] and Takayama [\cite=Tak], Todorov [\cite=Joro] proved that φ5: = Φ|5KV| is birational for all nonsingular projective 3-folds V with [formula]. Recently Di Biagio [\cite=DB] improved this by loosing the volume constraint, say [formula].

In fact, the least efficient induction step of Todorov is when V is birationally fibred by a family of surfaces with small volumes over a curve. Recalling a relevant result in our paper [\cite=Bonn] and using the "canonical restriction inequality" in Chen-Zuo [\cite=CAG], the mentioned induction step of Todorov can be handled quite well in an alternative way. This allows us to present the following improved statement:

Let V be a nonsingular projective 3-fold with [formula]. Then φm is birational for all m  ≥  5.

It is worthwhile to realize the idea in higher dimensions. First of all we note that the MMP works well for projective varieties of general type due to, for instance, Birkar-Cascini-Hacon-McKernan [\cite=BCHM], Hacon-McKernan [\cite=H-M-M] and Siu [\cite=Siu]. When we speak of "minimal models" or "minimal n-folds", it should always be understood that the variety has [formula]-factorial terminal singularities.

Definition. For any integer n  ≥  2, define the positive integer n to be the minimum satisfying the following properties:

Remark. We can see, later on, in Lemma [\ref=1] and Lemma [\ref=3+] that n <  +   ∞   for all n  ≥  2, which is essentially an induction on the dimension applying Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing and the boundedness theorem of Hacon-McKernan [\cite=H-M], Takayama [\cite=Tak] and Tsuji. (In fact, it is not hard to see from Chen-Chen [\cite=JDG] that 3  ≤  73.)

In the second part we shall prove the following:

Let Y be a nonsingular projective 4-fold. Assume [formula], say [formula]. Then |mKY| gives a birational map for all m  ≥  3.

A difficulty in high dimensions is that we do not know any practical lower bound for n (n  ≥  4). We need to set the following:

Notation. For all i > 0, the real number ei > 0 denotes the optimal constant so that [formula] for all i-folds Z of general type. Set

[formula]

Our last result is the following:

For all n  ≥  5, Cn are computable positive constants. Let Y be a nonsingular projective n-fold with [formula]. Then |mKY| gives a birational map for all m  ≥  Rn.

Throughout we are in favor of the following symbols:

"~  " denotes linear equivalence or [formula]-linear equivalence;

"[formula]" denotes numerical equivalence;

"A  ≥  B", for [formula]-divisors A and B, means that A - B is [formula]-linearly equivalent to an effective [formula]-divisor.

"[formula]" means, for linear systems |M1| and |M2|, [formula]

I would like to thank the anonymous referee for his(her) valuable suggestions and comments.

Proof of main statements

We start with the following:

Let S be a nonsingular projective surface of general type and σ:S  →  S0 the birational contraction onto the minimal model S0. Let Q be any nef and big [formula]-divisor on S. Then the linear system |KS + 3σ*(KS0) + ⌈Q⌉| gives a birational map.

Write L: = 3σ*(KS0) + Q. Clearly L is nef and L2 > 9.

Case 1. S is not a (1,2) surface. For any irreducible and reduced curve Ĉ  ⊂  S, passing through a very general point P∈S, it is sufficient to prove (σ*(KS0)  ·  Ĉ)  ≥  2 and so that (L  ·  Ĉ) > 6. Then the statement follows from either [\cite=Bonn] or [\cite=Masek]. In fact, (σ*(KS0)  ·  Ĉ) = (KS0  ·  C) where C: = σ*(Ĉ). We may verify this on S0 assuming C to be a curve in S0 passing through a very general point of S0. Note that C is of general type. Thus (KS0  ·  C) + C2  ≥  2. Suppose to the contrary that (KS0  ·  C)  ≤  1. Then C2  ≥  1. By the Hodge Index Theorem, one sees K2S0 = C2 = 1 and [formula]. The surface theory implies that S is either a (1,1) surface or a (1,0) surface. If (K2S0,pg(S)) = (1,0), then the torsion element θ: = KS0 - C is of order ≤  5 and h0(S0,C) = 1. Thus there are at most finite number of such curves on S0 since it is determined by the group [formula] with [formula]. By the choice of C, this is impossible. If (K2S0,pg(S)) = (1,1), then KS0  ~  C since [formula] by Bombieri [\cite=Bom] and thus C is the unique canonical curve of S0, which is impossible either by the choice of C. In a word, we have (KS0  ·  C)  ≥  2.

Case 2. S is a (1,2) surface. The statement follows from [\cite=JPAA].

Let Y be a nonsingular projective 3-fold of general type, B a smooth projective curve and h:Y  →  B be a fibration. Denote by F a general fiber of h. Assume [formula] for some rational number p > 5 and an effective [formula]-divisor Ep. Then |mKY| gives a birational map for all m  ≥  5.

Take a minimal model Y0 of Y. Modulo birational modifications over Y, we may assume for simplicity that there is a birational morphism π:Y  →  Y0. Take a sufficiently large and divisible integer m > 0 such that

mKY0 is a Cartier divisor;

both |mKY0| and |pmF| are base point free;

[formula];

the support of the union of Ep and all those exceptional divisors of π is simple normal crossing.

Then one has pmF  ≤  mπ*(KY0)  ≤  mKY. By Chen-Zuo [\cite=CAG], giving any small rational number ε > 0, one has

[formula]

for certain effective [formula]-divisor Hε on F where θ:F  →  F0 is the contraction onto the minimal model. Write [formula] where Ep' is another effective [formula]-divisor. By assumption the support of Ep' is simple normal crossing.

Pick two distinct general fibers F1, F2 of h. Both F1 and F2 are known to be nonsingular projective surfaces of general type. Since

[formula]

is nef and big, Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing ([\cite=KV] [\cite=VV]) gives the surjective map

[formula]

where [formula]. Observing that

[formula]

where

[formula]

for i = 1,2, we have

[formula]

Due to the surjectivity of ([\ref=1.1]), it is sufficient to show that |KFi  +  ⌈L4,i⌉| gives a birational map for i = 1,2.

Note that [formula] whenever p > 5. Take a small rational number ε0 > 0 such that [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

for an effective [formula]-divisor Hε0,i on Fi where θi:Fi  →  Fi,0 is the contraction onto its minimal model for i = 1,2.

Now since

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=1] implies that

[formula]

gives a birational map and so does |KFi  +  ⌈L4,i⌉| for i = 1,2.

Since F1 and F2 are general fibers of h, |5KY| gives a birational map. So we conclude the statement.

Now we are prepared to prove Theorem [\ref=m1]. The outline of the proof follows that of Todorov [\cite=Joro] except that the last step (i.e. Subcase 2.2) is implemented by an alternative argument.

Assume [formula] for some rational number α0 > 0. For any very small rational number ε > 0, take a birational modification μ:V'  →  V such that there is a decomposition

[formula]

for some ample [formula]-divisor A and some effective [formula]-divisor Eε and that the decomposition satisfies the properties of Takayama [\cite=Tak]. (In particular, [formula], but [formula].)

Take two different points x1,x2∈V' at very general positions. Then there is a divisor [formula] with [formula] such that [formula] for i = 1,2.

Suppose the volume of those surfaces passing through very general points of V' has the lower bound α21. Of course, α21  ≥  1 and the volume of curves passing through very general points of V' has the lower bound α2  ≥  2.

Case 1. Assume α1  ≥  10. According to Takayama [\cite=Tak], there is a constant [formula] and an effective [formula]-divisor [formula] such that [formula] and that at least one point xi is isolated in [formula]. Thus Nadel vanishing implies that |(⌊a3⌋ + 2)KV'| gives a birational map. Unfortunately it is not enough to get the birationality of |5KV| whenever α1 is smaller. In fact, according to Takayama, one may take

[formula]

By taking a very small ε, while under the premise of α0 > 12 and α1  ≥  10, one can easily verify a3 < 4, which means φ5 is birational.

Case 2. Contrary to Case 1, we may assume [formula] contains an irreducible component which, passing through a very general point of V', is a surface of volume < 102, i.e. α1 < 10. As already realized by McKernan [\cite=JM] and in Todorov [\cite=Joro], there are two dominant morphisms ν:V''  →  V' and f:V''  →  B where V'' is a normal projective 3-fold and B is a normal projective curve. For a very general point x∈V', there is a surface Vx which is a pure centre of a lc pair (V',Dx) with [formula] and [formula] and, furthermore, Vx is dominated by at least one general fiber of f.

Subcase 2.1. Suppose ν is non-birational, which means that passing through a very general point x∈V' there are at least two lc centers of the pairs (V',D) and (V',D̃). Pick two different very general points x1( = x),x2∈V'. Using Todorov [\cite=Joro], one may find a divisor [formula] with [formula] such that [formula] has at worst a 1-dimensional centre at x1 = x. This situation also fits into Takayama's induction [\cite=Tak]. In fact, we may set s2 = 0 and [formula] in Takayama's Notation [\cite=Tak] and begin the induction onwards. Then one gets a divisor [formula] with [formula] where

[formula]

such that [formula] at x1. Clearly one has

[formula]

Taking a very small ε > 0, one easily sees â3 < 4 as long as α0 > 12. Thus, by Nadel vanishing again, φ5 is birational whenever [formula] in this subcase.

Subcase 2.2. Suppose ν is birational. Without loss of generality, V'' can be considered smooth. We study the birationality of |5KV''| instead. We have a fibration f:V''  →  B with B a normal projective curve. By assumption a general fiber S of f has the property [formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

and [\cite=Bonn] implies that

[formula]

for any very small rational number η > 0 (note here that the proof of [\cite=Bonn] works for any curve B). Take such a number η so that τ0  -  η > 5. Then we are in the situation of Proposition [\ref=3] which says φ5 is birational. We are done.

Next we shall study the high dimensional analog.

Let Y be a nonsingular projective n-fold (n  ≥  4) of general type, B a smooth projective curve and f:Y  →  B a fibration. Denote by X a general fiber of f. Assume [formula] for some rational number pn > 2n - 1 - 2 and for some effective [formula]-divisor Epn. Then |mKY| gives a birational map for all m  ≥  n - 1.

Take a minimal model Y0 of Y. Modulo birational modifications over Y, we may assume for simplicity that there is a birational morphism π:Y  →  Y0. Take a sufficiently large and divisible integer m > 0 such that

mKY0 is a Cartier divisor, mEpn is an integral divisor and |mKY0| is base point free;

|pnmX| is base point free;

|pnmKX0| is base point free where X0 is a minimal model of X;

[formula];

the support of the union of Epn and all those exceptional divisors of π is simple normal crossing.

Then one has pnmX  ≤  mπ*(KY0)  ≤  mKY. Write [formula] where Epn' is another effective [formula]-divisor. Pick general fibers X and X1  ≠  X2 of f.

Step 1. The canonical restriction inequality.

If g(B) > 0, one may take further modification Y' of Y (still assume Y' = Y) such that, for the fiber X' over X (still assume X' = X), there is a birational morphism ν:X  →  X0. Now the proof of Chen-Zuo [\cite=CAG] implies

[formula]

(Note that the key fact used in the proof of [\cite=CAG] is the rational chain connectedness of Shokurov in dimension 3 and that was proved by Hacon-McKernan [\cite=HM] for all dimensions.)

If g(B) = 0, we have the inclusion [formula]. Take a very large and divisible integer l such that both lKY0 and lKX0 are Cartier divisors. Then we have the inclusion

[formula]

The semi-positivity theorem (see, for instance, Viehweg [\cite=VS]) implies that f*ωlpmY / B is generated by global sections. Since |ν*(lpnmKX0)| (as the moving part of |lpnmKX|) is base point free and the moving part of |(lpnm + 2lm)KY| is exactly |π*((lpnm + 2lm)KY0)| thanks to the MMP, we have

[formula]

In both cases, we have the following equality

[formula]

for certain effective [formula]-divisor Gn on X.

Step 2. The induction step by means of vanishing.

Both X1 and X2 are known to be nonsingular projective (n - 1)-folds of general type. Since

[formula]

is nef and big by assumption, Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing gives the surjective map

[formula]

where [formula]. Observing that

[formula]

where

[formula]

for i = 1,2, we have

[formula]

Due to the surjectivity of ([\ref=4.1]), it is sufficient to show that |KXi  +  ⌈Ln,i⌉| gives a birational map for i = 1,2.

Step 3. Verification on the general fiber.

Since pn > 2n - 1 - 2, we have [formula] and [formula]. Now we have

[formula]

for an effective [formula]-divisor Gn,i on Xi where θi:Xi  →  Xi,0 is the contraction onto its minimal model Xi,0 for i = 1,2. Since

[formula]

one knows that

[formula]

gives a birational map by the definition of n - 1 and so does |KXi  +  ⌈Ln,i⌉| for i = 1,2.

Since X1 and X2 are general fibers of f, |n - 1KY| gives a birational map. So we are done.

For all n  ≥  3, n <  +   ∞  .

We have already seen 2 = 5 in Lemma [\ref=1]. For n > 2, we prove this by an induction on the dimensions. We sketch the proof here.

By the boundedness theorem of Hacon-McKernan, Takayama and Tsuji, we can take a positive integer m0 so that Pm0(X0)  ≥  2 for all minimal projective n-folds X0 of general type. Take a pencil Λ  ⊂  |m0KX0|. Given any birational morphism ν:X'  →  X0 and given any nef and big [formula]-divisor R on X', take a birational modification ν1:X1  →  X0 such that:

X1 is smooth;

ν1 factors through ν, i.e. [formula] and thus X1 is over X';

the moving part of ν*1(Λ) is base point free;

the support of union of exceptional divisors of ν1 and the pull back of {R} is simple normal crossing.

Now it is sufficient to find some positive number m (independent of X0, the choice of ν and the [formula]-divisor R) so that

[formula]

gives a birational map.

Take two generic irreducible elements F1 and F2 in the moving part of ν*1(Λ). In other words, the Fi is a general fiber of the induced fibration after taking the Stein factorization of [formula]. By definition, F1 and F2 are irreducible elements in a free pencil. Both F1 and F2 are smooth by Bertini's theorem and they are of general type with dimensions n - 1. For any integer m  ≥  2m0 + 3, since (m - 2)ν*1(KX0) + ν'*R  ≥  (m - 2m0 - 2)ν*1(KX0) + ν'*R + F1 + F2, Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing gives the surjective map:

[formula]

Set F = Fi and we study the restricted linear system on F. Modulo further birational modifications, we may assume that there is a birational contraction morphism σ:F  →  F0 onto a minimal model F0. By the canonical restriction inequality in Chen [\cite=KIAS], we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

where q: = m - 2m0 - 2, [formula] is an integer depending only on m and Q is a certain nef and big [formula]-divisor on F. By the induction, the statement is true on F as long as t is large enough and such an integer t should work for all (n - 1)-fold F. The surjective map [\ref=sur] says that, for some integer m, the linear system |KX1  +  ⌈(m  -  2)ν * 1(KX0)  +  ν' * (R)⌉| separates different general F1 and F2, and it separates general points of Fi for i = 1,2. We are done.

With Proposition [\ref=4] and Lemma [\ref=3+], we are prepared for proving Theorem [\ref=m2].

We sketch the proof while omitting redundant calculations. We keep a similar procedure to the proof of Theorem [\ref=m1].

First of all we know 3  ≥  27 due to Iano-Fletcher's example [formula] in [\cite=Fletcher].

Then one uses Takayama's effective induction in [\cite=Tak] and McKernan's dominant morphism ν:V''  →  V' in [\cite=JM] to exclusively treat 3 cases with regard to [formula], where V' is certain birational model of Y as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=m1] replacing V by Y:

Only sub-varieties of dimension ≤  2 passing through very general points of Y need to be considered. Note that the situation corresponding to Subcase 2.1 in the proof of Theorem [\ref=m1] is included here. Meanwhile, ν is non-birational by assumption. We may use Todorov [\cite=Joro] to find a divisor D''  ~  λ''A such that [formula] has at worst a 1-dimensional lc center passing through x-a very general point of V'. Replace (V',D) by (V',D'') and go on the procedure of applying Takayama's induction.

Apart from i, there is a 3-fold center, with a large volume, of the pair (V',Dx) passing through a very general point x∈V'.

Due to McKernan [\cite=JM], Y is birationally fibred by 3-folds of small volumes over a curve B.

For Case i and Case ii, it is easy to find the constraint on [formula] (say [formula]) so that |27KY| gives a birational map by assuming that all those 3-folds passing through very general points of Y have volume [formula]. In fact, the worse situation in Case i is when ν is non-birational for which we use Todorov [\cite=Joro]. So we may set s2 = 0, [formula], while ε  ↦  0, and then Takayama's induction gives, [formula] and

[formula]

Thus we have [formula] and ⌈a4⌉ + 1 < 27 as long as α0 is large enough. Actually this is the case when [formula]. Thus |27KY| gives a birational map. In Case ii, by assuming [formula], Takayama's induction gives:

[formula]

[formula]

while letting ε  ↦  0. Finally we have a4 < s4 + t4  /  α0. Still under the assumption [formula], it is easy to see ⌈a4⌉ + 1 < 27. Thus we see the birationality of Φ|27KY|.

For Case iii, we may use Proposition [\ref=4] under the condition that Y is birationally fibred by 3-folds X of small volume (say [formula]). Now using a similar method to that of [\cite=Bonn] by computing the ratio [formula], it is easy for us to find the condition on [formula] again. In fact, [formula] will do for this case to get the birationality of |mKY| for all m  ≥  3. We are done.

Thanks to the elaborate calculation in Di Biagio [\cite=DB], we can save several pages to present here our effective result for all dimensions. So far we have the following direct result in higher dimensions:

(=Corollary [\ref=m3]) There are computable constants Cn for all n  ≥  5. Let Y be a nonsingular projective n-fold with [formula]. Then |mKY| gives a birational map onto its image for all m  ≥  Rn.

We omit the proof since it can be obtained by a similar argument to that of Theorem [\ref=m1] and Theorem [\ref=m2]. This may serve as an interesting exercise.

Finally we note that R3  =  2 = r2 = 5 by Bombieri and, in fact, R4  =  3  ≥  r3. It is natural to ask the following:

Open Problem Xn. Is it always true that Rn  =  n - 1 = rn - 1 for all n  ≥  4?

A positive answer to Problem Xn should be expectable.
