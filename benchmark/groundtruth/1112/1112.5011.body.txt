Whitney umbrellas and swallowtails

Introduction

The map-germ

[formula]

is well-known as the normal form of Whitney umbrella after Whitney's pioneer works [\cite=whitney] [\cite=whitney2]. For the map-germ [\eqref=Whitney], compose the following two coordinate transformations: hs(x,y) = (x,x2 + y) and ht(X,Y,Z) = (X, - Z, - Y + Z) where (X,Y,Z) is the standard coordinates of the target space [formula]. Then, we have the following:

[formula]

Put

[formula]

For the map-germ [\eqref=G], compose the following two scaling transformations: [formula] and Ht(X,Y,Z) = (12X,12Y,6Z). Then, we have the following:

[formula]

The map-germ [\eqref=swallowtail] is well-known as the normal form of swallowtail (for instance, see [\cite=brucegiblin] p.129).

Two C∞ map-germs [formula] are said to be A-equivalent if there exist germs of C∞ diffeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that [formula]. A C∞ map-germ [formula] is called a Whitney umbrella (resp., swallowtail) if φ is A-equivalent to [\eqref=Whitney] (resp., [\eqref=swallowtail]). As above, the Whitney umbrella [\eqref=Whitney] produces the swallowtail [\eqref=swallowtail] via [\eqref=g] and [\eqref=G]. By the converse procedure, the swallowtail [\eqref=swallowtail] produces the Whitney umbrella [\eqref=Whitney].

Note that it is impossible to produce a swallowtail by integrating [\eqref=Whitney] directly. This is because the discriminant set of [\eqref=swallowtail] is not diffeomorphic to the discriminant set of the following [\eqref=5]:

[formula]

Note further that the form [\eqref=g] may be written as follows:

[formula]

where b(X,Y) = (XY,Y) (b stands for the blow down ).

A C∞ map-germ [formula] having the following form [\eqref=pedal] is said to be of pedal unfolding type.

[formula]

where [formula] is a C∞ function-germ such that [formula] and [formula] is a C∞ function-germ.

For a C∞ map-germ of pedal unfolding type φ(x,y) = (n(x,y)p(x,y),p(x,y),y), put

[formula]

The map-germ [formula] is called the integration of φ.

A C∞ map-germ [formula] is called a Legendrian map-germ if there exists a germ of C∞ vector field [formula] along Φ such that the following conditions hold where the dot in the center stands for the scalar product of two vectors of [formula] and [formula] stands for the unit tangent bundle of [formula].

[formula] [formula] = 0.

The map-germ [formula] defined by

[formula]

is non-singular. The map-germ LΦ is called a Legendrian lift of Φ.

The C∞ vector field νΦ is called a unit normal vector field of Φ.

A Legendrian map-germ [formula] is said to be normalized if Φ satisfies the following three conditions:

Φ has the form Φ(x,y) = (Φ1(x,y),Φ2(x,y),y).

[formula].

νΦ(0,0) is [formula] or [formula].

For a normalized Legendrian map-germ Φ(x,y) = (Φ1(x,y),Φ2(x,y),y), put

[formula]

The map-germ [formula] is called the differentiation of Φ.

Since any map-germ [formula] which is a germ of one-parameter pedal unfolding of a spherical pedal curve has the form [\eqref=pedal] (see [\cite=nishimura3]), it is reasonable that a map-germ φ having the form [\eqref=pedal] is said to be of pedal unfolding type. As shown in [\cite=nishimura3], not only non-singular map-germs but also Whitney umbrellas may be realized as germs of one-parameter pedal unfoldings of spherical pedal curves. For details on Legendrian map-germs, see [\cite=arnoldetall] [\cite=izumiya] [\cite=zakalyukin2] [\cite=zakalyukin]. Note that both [\eqref=G] and [\eqref=cuspidal] are normalized Legendrian map-germs.

For a C∞ map-germ of pedal unfolding type [formula], I(φ) is a normalized Legendrian map-germ.

For a normalized Legendrian map-germ [formula], D(Φ) is a map-germ of pedal unfolding type.

Put

[formula]

The main purpose of this paper is to show the following Theorem [\ref=theorem_1]:

The map I:W  →  S defined by W∋φ  ↦  I(φ)∈S is well-defined and bijective.

The map D:S  →  W defined by S∋Φ  ↦  D(Φ)∈W is well-defined and bijective.

Incidentally, we show the following Theorem [\ref=theorem_2]. A C∞ map-germ [formula] is called a cuspidal edge if Φ is A-equivalent to the following [\eqref=cuspidal] :

[formula]

Put

[formula]

The map I:N  →  C defined by N∋φ  ↦  I(φ)∈C is well-defined and bijective.

The map D:C  →  N defined by C∋Φ  ↦  D(Φ)∈N is well-defined and bijective.

Both the following two are well-known (for instance, see [\cite=arnoldetall]).

Any stable map-germ [formula] is either a Whitney umbrella or non-singular.

Any Legendrian stable singularity [formula] is either a swallowtail or a cuspidal edge.

Therefore, Theorems [\ref=theorem_1] and [\ref=theorem_2] may be regarded as the fundamental theorem of calculus for stable map-germs [formula] and Legendrian stable singularities [formula].

Theorems [\ref=theorem_1] and [\ref=theorem_2] yield the following conjecture naturally.

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs of pedal unfolding type. Suppose that φ1 is A-equivalent to φ2. Then, I(φ1) is A-equivalent to I(φ2).

Let [formula] be two normalized Legendrian map-germs. Suppose that Φ1 is A-equivalent to Φ2. Then, D(Φ1) is A-equivalent to D(Φ2).

In §[\ref=section_2], several preparations for the proofs of Theorems [\ref=theorem_1] and [\ref=theorem_2] and the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition_1] are given. Theorems [\ref=theorem_1] and [\ref=theorem_2] are proved in §[\ref=section_3] and §[\ref=section_4] respectively.

Preliminaries

Function-germs with two variables and map-germs with two variables

Let E2 be the set of C∞ function-germs [formula] and let m2 be the subset of E2 consisting of C∞ function-germs [formula]. The sets E2 have natural [formula]-algebra structures. For a C∞ map-germ [formula], let φ*:E2  →  E2 be the [formula]-algebra homomorphism defined by [formula]. Put Q(φ) = E2  /  φ*m2E2. Then, Q(φ) is an [formula]-algebra. The following Proposition [\ref=proposition_2] is a special case of theorem (2.1) of [\cite=mather4].

Let [formula] be a C∞ function-germ. Then, the following hold:

The [formula]-algebra Q(p(x,y),y) is isomorphic to Q(x2,y) if and only if [formula] and [formula].

The [formula]-algebra Q(p(x,y),y) is isomorphic to Q(x,y) if and only if (x,y)  ↦  (p(x,y),y) is a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism.

Let [formula] be the linear transformation of the form T(s,λ) = ( - s,λ). Two C∞ function-germs [formula] are said to be KT-equivalent if there exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] of the form [formula] and a C∞ function-germ [formula] of the form [formula] such that [formula].

Two C∞ map-germs [formula] (i = 1,2) of the following form

[formula]

are A-equivalent if and only if the function-germs pi(x2,y) are KT-equivalent.

Here, [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=theorem_3] and the Malgrange preparation theorem (for instance, see [\cite=arnoldetall]), the following holds:

Two C∞ map-germs [formula] (i = 1,2) of the following form

[formula]

where [formula] and ni(x,y) satisfies [formula] for each i∈{1,2}, are A-equivalent if and only if the function-germs pi(x2,y) are KT-equivalent.

Map-germs of pedal unfolding type

Let [formula] be a representative of a given C∞ map-germ of pedal unfolding type, where I,J be a sufficiently small intervals containing the origin of [formula]. Then, we may put [formula]. Put

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula] for any x∈I and y∈J, for any fixed y∈J we may define the map-germ [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit tangent bundle of [formula]. Then, since φ is a representative of a map-germ of pedal unfolding type, we have the following:

For any y∈J, [formula] is a Legendrian lift of the map-germ x  ↦  (Φ1(x,y),Φ2(x,y)).

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.1], we have the following:

For any y∈J, the map-germ [formula] defined by [formula] is a Legendrian map-germ.

Next, put

[formula]

Then, we have the following:

For any x∈I and y∈J,

[formula]

Since [formula] for any x∈I and y∈J, we may define the map-germ [formula] as

[formula]

Then, by Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.3] we have the following:

[formula] is a Legendrian lift of Φ.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.4] we have the following:

[formula] is a Legendrian map-germ.

Normalized Legendrian map-germs

Let [formula] be a representative of a given normalized Legendrian map-germ [formula], where U is a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin of [formula]. We assume that the origin of [formula] is a singular point of Φ. By the condition (a) of the definition of normalized Legendrian map-germs, we may assume that Φ has the form Φ(x,y) = (Φ1(x,y),Φ2(x,y),y). Since Φ is a a representative of a Legendrian map-germ, we have the following:

There exists a C∞ vector field νΦ along Φ,

[formula]

such that the following three hold:

[formula].

[formula].

The map [formula] defined by [formula] is an immersion.

By the condition (c) of the definition of normalized Legendrian map-germs, we have the following:

For the vector field νΦ, n1(0,0)  ≠  0 and n2(0,0) = n3(0,0) = 0.

By the assertion (i) of Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.6] and Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.7], we have the following equality as function-germs.

[formula]

Then, by the condition (b) of the definition of normalized Legendrian maps and the equality [\eqref=divisible], the following holds:

The map-germ D(Φ) maps the origin to the origin.

Put

[formula]

Then, we have clearly the following:

Both function-germs n and p are of class C∞ and the equality D(Φ)(x,y) = (n(x,y)p(x,y),p(x,y),y) holds.

Furthrmore, we have the following:

The function-germ n satisfies that n(0,0) = 0 and [formula].

Proof.  By Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.7], we have that n(0,0) = 0. Suppose that [formula]. Then, by differentiating both side of the equality in the assertion (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.6] with respect to x, we have the following equality:

[formula]

Since we have assumed [formula], we have that [formula]. Thus and since Φ is a normalized Legendrian map-germ such that the origin of [formula] is a singular point of Φ, we have that [formula]. Thus, we have that [formula]. Hence, by the condition (b) of the definition of normalized Legendrian maps, Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.7] and the equality [\eqref=divisible], we have a contradiction. [formula]

Let [formula] be a Legendrian map-germ and let νΦ be a unit normal vector field of Φ given in the definition of Legendrian map-germs. The C∞ function-germ [formula] defined by the following is called the Legendrian-Jacobian of Φ.

[formula]

Note that if νΦ satisfies the conditions of unit normal vector field of Φ, then -  νΦ also satisfies them. Thus, the sign of LJΦ(x,y) depends on the particular choice of unit normal vector field νΦ. The Legendrian Jacobian of Φ is called also the signed area density function (for instance, see [\cite=sajiumeharayamada2]). Although it seems reasonable to call LJΦ the area density function from the viewpoint of investigating the singular surface Φ(U) (U is a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin of [formula]), it seems reasonable to call it the Legendrian Jacobian from the viewpoint of investigating the singular map-germ Φ. Hence, we call LJΦ the Legendrian Jacobian of Φ in this paper.

Let [formula] be a normalized Legendrian map-germ and νΦ is a unit normal vector field of Φ.

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.7], we may put

[formula]

The Legendrian Jacobian LJΦ is expressed as follows:

[formula]

Proof.  Calculations show that

[formula]

where the cross in the center stands for the vector product. It follows [formula]. [formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition_1]

Proof of the assertion (i) of Proposition [\ref=proposition_1].

Put [formula]. Then, by Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.5], Φ is a Legendrian map-germ. Thus, in order to complete the proof of the assertion (i) of Proposition [\ref=proposition_1], it is sufficient to show the conditions (b), (c) of the definition of normalized Legendrian map-germs are satisfied.

Put φ(x,y) = (n(x,y)p(x,y),p(x,y),y). Then, by the definition of map-germs of pedal unfolding type, we have that n(0,0) = 0 and p(0,0) = 0. It follows that [formula]. Thus, the condition (b) is satisfied. By Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.4], the following LΦ is a germ of Legendrian lift of Φ.

[formula]

where [formula]. Since n(0,0) = 0 and [formula], we have

[formula]

Thus the condition (c) is satisfied. [formula]

Proof of the assertion (ii) of Proposition [\ref=proposition_1].

The assertion (ii) of Proposition [\ref=proposition_1] follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemma_2.8], [\ref=lemma_2.9] and [\ref=lemma_2.10]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_1]

Suppose that both I:W  →  S and D:S  →  W are well-defined. Then, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the following hold:

[formula]

Thus, both I and D are bijective. Therefore, in order to complete the proof, it is sufficient to show that both I and D are well-defined.

Proof that I:W  →  S is well-defined.

Let φ(x,y) = (n(x,y)pφ(x,y),pφ(x,y),y) be an element of W. Put Φ  =  I(φ). Then, Φ is a normalized Legendrian map-germ by Proposition [\ref=proposition_1] in §[\ref=intro]. Let g be the Whitney umbrella of pedal unfolding type [\eqref=g] defined in §[\ref=intro]:

[formula]

There exists a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] such that h has the form h(x,y) = (h1(x,y),h2(y)) and [formula] is x2 + y or - (x2 + y).

Proof.  Since φ is a Whitney umbrella of pedal unfolding type, we have the following:

[formula]

Thus, we may put pφ(x,0) = a2x2 + o(x2) (a2  ≠  0) by Proposition [\ref=proposition_2] in §[\ref=section_2]. By the Morse lemma with parameters (for instance, see [\cite=brucegiblin]), there exists a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] such that h has the form h(x,y) = (h1(x,y),h2(y)) and [formula] by a certain C∞ function-germ [formula]. Since φ is A-equivalent to g, by Corollary [\ref=corollary_1] in §[\ref=section_2], ±  (x2 + q(y)) is KT-equivalent to pg and thus [formula] is a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism. Hence, Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.1] follows. [formula]

The normalized Legendrian map-germ Φ is a swallowtail.

Proof.  Put G = I(g). Then, G has the form [\eqref=G] in § 1 which is a normalized swallowtail. Since G is normalized, [formula] is the null vector field for G defined in [\cite=kokuburossmansajiumeharayamada] [\cite=sajiumeharayamada], that is, [formula] holds for any (x,y) which is a singular point of G. Thus and since G is a swallowtail, the following three hold by corollary 2.5 of [\cite=sajiumeharayamada].

[formula],

[formula].

[formula].

On the other hand, by Lemmas [\ref=lemma_2.11] and [\ref=lemma_3.1], there exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ function-germ [formula] such that h has the form h(x,y) = (h1(x,y),h2(y)), ξ(0,0)  ≠  0 and the following hold:

[formula]

Hence and since [formula] is the null vector field for Φ (this is because Φ is normalized), the following three hold for LJΦ.

[formula],

[formula],

[formula].

Hence, Φ is a swallowtail by corollary 2.5 of [\cite=sajiumeharayamada]. [formula]

Proof that D:S  →  W is well-defined.

Let Φ be an element of S. Then, by Proposition [\ref=proposition_2] in §[\ref=section_2], D(Φ) is of pedal unfolding type.

For the Legendrian Jacobian LJΦ, the following three hold:

[formula],

[formula].

[formula].

Proof.  Since Φ is normalized, [formula] is the null vector field. Thus and since Φ is a swallowtail, Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.3] follows from corollary 2.5 of [\cite=sajiumeharayamada].

For the Φ, the map-germ of pedal unfolding type D(Φ) is a Whitney umbrella.

Proof.  Since D(Φ) is of pedal unfolding type, there exists a C∞ function-germ [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] where Φ(x,y) = (Φ1(x,y), Φ2(x,y),y). Put [formula]. Then, by Lemmas [\ref=lemma_2.11], [\ref=lemma_3.3] and the Morse lemma with parameters, there exists a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] such that h has the form h(x,y) = (h1(x,y),h2(y)) and [formula] is x2 + y or - (x2 + y). Therefore, by Corollary [\ref=corollary_1] in §[\ref=section_2], D(Φ) is A-equivalent to g. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_2]

As same as Theorem [\ref=theorem_1], it is sufficient to show that both I:N  →  C and D:C  →  N are well-defined.

Proof that I:N  →  C is well-defined.

Let φ(x,y) = (n(x,y)pφ(x,y),pφ(x,y),y) be an element of N. Put Φ  =  I(φ). Then, since φ is of pedal unfolding type, Φ is a normalized Legendrian map-germ by Proposition [\ref=proposition_1] in §[\ref=intro]. Let g be the non-singular map-germ of pedal unfolding type defined by g(x,y) = (x2,x,y).

There exists a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] such that h has the form h(x,y) = (h1(x,y),h2(y)) and [formula] holds.

Proof.  Since φ is non-singular and of pedal unfolding type, we have the following:

[formula]

Thus, (pφ(x,y),y) is a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism by Proposition [\ref=proposition_2] in §[\ref=section_2]. From the form of (pφ(x,y),y), its inverse map-germ [formula] has the form h(x,y) = (h1(x,y),h2(y)). Since h is the inverse map-germ of (pφ(x,y),y), it follows that [formula]. [formula]

The normalized Legendrian map-germ Φ is a cuspidal edge.

Proof.  Since Φ is normalized, [formula] is the null vector field for Φ. By Lemmas [\ref=lemma_2.11], [\ref=lemma_4.1], we have that [formula]. Thus, thus the null vector field [formula] is transverse to {(x,y)  |  LJΦ(x,y) = 0} at [formula]. Hence, Φ is a cuspidal edge by proposition 1.3 of [\cite=kokuburossmansajiumeharayamada]. [formula]

Proof that D:C  →  N is well-defined.

Let Φ be an element of C. Then, by Proposition [\ref=proposition_1] in §[\ref=intro], D(Φ) is of pedal unfolding type.

For the Legendrian Jacobian LJΦ, two properties LJΦ(0,0) = 0 and [formula] hold.

Proof.  Since [formula] is the null vector field for Φ and Φ is a cuspidal edge, Lemma [\ref=lemma_4.3] follows from corollary 2.5 of [\cite=sajiumeharayamada].

For the Φ, the map-germ of pedal unfolding type D(Φ) is non-singular and D(Φ)(0,0) = (0,0,0).

Proof.  Since D(Φ) is of pedal unfolding type, there exists a C∞ function-germ [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] where Φ(x,y) = (Φ1(x,y), Φ2(x,y),y). Put [formula]. Then, by Lemmas [\ref=lemma_2.11] and [\ref=lemma_4.3], the map-germ (x,y)  ↦  (pφ(x,y),y) is a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism. Thus, D(Φ) is non-singular. [formula]
