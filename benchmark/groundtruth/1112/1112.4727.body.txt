On a conjecture of Berndt and Kim

Introduction

In his second notebook [\cite=Be], page 324, Ramanujan claims an asymptotic expansion for the partial theta function

[formula]

with [formula] as t  →  0+. It is not clear, just given the left-hand side of [\eqref=Ram], that the coefficients of its asymptotic expansion (in t) are always positive integers, nor that one should expect this. Galway [\cite=Ga] proved this curious fact to be true using alternating permutations and relations to Euler numbers. Stanley [\cite=St], answering a question of Galway, then gave a nice combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion ([\ref=Ram]) as the number of fixed-point-free alternating involutions in the symmetric group S2n, providing a second proof that the coefficients are positive integers.

Berndt and Kim [\cite=BK] study more general partial theta functions.

[formula]

where b is real. They show that, similarly to [\eqref=Ram], fb(t) admits an asymptotic expansion of the form

[formula]

where the an are given explicitely in term of Euler numbers and Hermite polynomials [\cite=BK]. For the purposes of this paper, we do not require the explicit shape of the an, so we do not state it here. (We point out a small typo in [\cite=BK] equation (1.3): the exponent of (1 - t) / (1 + t) should read (1 - 2b) / 4 rather than (2b - 1) / 4, as the authors correctly state in [\cite=BK] equation (2.9).)

In analogy to the results established by Galway and Stanley pertaining to the coefficients of ([\ref=Ram]), Berndt and Kim prove that the coefficients an of the generalized partial theta functions defined in ([\ref=falseb]) are integers if [formula] [\cite=BK], and make the following conjecture regarding their positivity.

For any positive integer b, for sufficiently large n, the coefficients an in the asymptotic expansion [\eqref=asexp], have the same sign.

The purpose of this note is to prove this conjecture of Berndt and Kim.

The Berndt-Kim conjecture is true. More precisely, if [formula], then an > 0 for [formula], and if [formula], then an < 0 for n  ≫  0.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]

To prove the theorem, we first observe that for integers b  ≥  2,

[formula]

We proceed by induction on b to prove Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]. The case b = 1 follows from [\cite=Ga] as mentioned in § [\ref=intro]. To prove the case b = 2 we employ the fact that the q-series in this case is essentially a modular form. To be more precise, we have that

[formula]

where we have adopted the notation [formula] from [\cite=BK]. The function [formula], where [formula], is the modular form defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is Dedekind's eta-function, a well known modular form of weight 1 / 2. Employing the modular transformation of η (see [\cite=Radem] e.g.)

[formula]

we obtain that

[formula]

as θ  →  0+, and thus as t  →  0+. Therefore

[formula]

which clearly has positive coefficients in its t-expansion. We now assume Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] holds for some b - 1  ≥  1, and prove that it also holds for b + 1. (The first two inductive cases b - 1 = 1,2 are proven above.) We use [\eqref=recurse] and split

[formula]

Since the t-expansion of (1 + t)b is finite and contains only positive coefficients, it suffices to prove that the t-coefficents in the asymptotic expansion of

[formula]

eventually all have the same sign. We will address the fact that the sign is dependent on the residue class of b mod 4 as stated in Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] later.

It is easy to show that

[formula]

By induction, we may assume without loss of generality that

[formula]

as t  →  0+, where αn > 0 for n  ≥  L, for some L  ≥  0. Set

[formula]

It suffices to show that

[formula]

is positive for m  ≫  0. We break the sum ([\ref=mixedsum]) into two parts

[formula]

where we assume m  ≫  0 is sufficiently large to ensure m  ≥  L.

Since L is independent of m and the βj's are monotonically decreasing (in j, for fixed b), we may bound

[formula]

as m  →    ∞  . Similarly, Σ2 may be estimated from below by

[formula]

as m  →    ∞  . Since clearly mb  ≫  mb - 1, the positivity of Σ2 dominaties, and we have that the coefficients in the asymptotic t-expansion of fb + 1(q) have for sufficiently large m the same sign as claimed.

The more precise claim that the coefficients in the asymptotic t-expansion for fb(q) are eventually positive for [formula] and eventually negative for [formula] follows easily by induction using ([\ref=recurse]), and the previously established facts that the coefficients in the asymptotic t-expansion of f1(q) and f2(q) are eventually positive.
