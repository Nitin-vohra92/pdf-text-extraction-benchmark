Introduction

Motivation

Statistical properties of dynamical systems are traditionally studied in a stationary context. Let us elaborate briefly, discussing only discrete time for simplicity. Suppose M is the set of all possible states of the system. Given the state xn∈M at some time n  ≥  0, the state of the system at time n + 1 is assumed to be either (i) xn + 1 = Txn, where T:M  →  M is an a priori specified map used at every time step or (ii) xn + 1 = Tn + 1xn, where the maps Ti:M  →  M are drawn randomly and independently of each other and of [formula] from a set of maps [formula] according to a distribution η. Now, suppose the initial point x0 has random distribution μ: [formula], for all measurable sets E  ⊂  M. By stationarity we mean that [formula], for all n  ≥  0, for all measurable sets E  ⊂  M. This condition translates to μ(T- 1E) = μ(E) in case (i) and to [formula] in case (ii). In either case the measure μ is called invariant. The reader may verify that these definitions result, indeed, in a strictly stationary process in that all finite dimensional distributions are shift-invariant: [formula], for all choices of the indices and of the measurable sets. Let f be a measurable function on M, which represents a quantity whose observed values f(xn) at different times one is interested in. Given an invariant measure one may, for example, study the statistical behavior of the sums [formula] of observations, making use of the fact that (f(xn))n  ≥  0 is a stationary sequence of random variables.

A key ingredient in obtaining advanced statistical results on interesting systems is chaos, that is to say the dynamical complexity due to sensitive dependence of the trajectories (xn)n  ≥  0 on the initial point x0. In this paper we initiate a program to free ourselves from the standard constraint of stationarity, advocating the following view:

The deliberately imprecise statement above is proposed as a guideline and challenge instead of a theorem. We believe that a result obtained for a strongly chaotic stationary system quite generically has a non-stationary counterpart if the corresponding non-stationary system continues to be sufficiently chaotic.

The inspiration for undertaking the program stems from non-equilibrium processes in nature where it is often unfounded or simply false to assume that an observed system is driven by stationary forces. For example, it is conceivable that an ambient system governed in principle by measure preserving dynamics is, for all practical time scales, in a non-equilibrium state, so that the subsystem actually being observed is better modeled separately in terms of non-stationary dynamical rules. The remark is by no means limited to situations of physical interest alone, but seems to lend itself rather universally to applied sciences. Second, from a purely theoretical point of view it appears very restrictive to focus only on stationary dynamical models.

In order to advance the program in a meaningful way, we need a concrete model to work with. Deferring technical definitions till later, let the state xn∈M of the system at time n be determined by the action of the composition [formula] on the initial state x0∈M, where each map Ti:M  →  M describes the dynamical rules at time i. For us, the constituent maps Ti are topologically transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms on a 2-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold M, which form a prime class of nontrivial chaotic maps. It is clear that some additional control is needed; for instance, an alternating sequence of an Anosov diffeomorphism T and its inverse T- 1 would yield [formula] for even values of n, which does not result in chaotic dynamics. To that end, the maps Ti are here assumed to evolve slowly with time i, but otherwise they may do so in a rather arbitrary fashion. We point out that the maps Ti need not be randomly picked, there is no assumption of stationarity, and for large n the map Tn may be far from the map T1. Even if all the maps Ti preserved the same initial measure, so that the random variables xn were identically distributed, the process (xn)n  ≥  0 would typically fail to be stationary.

We call such compositions non-stationary and think of them as descriptions of dynamical systems out of equilibrium.

We prove in this paper that the system at issue loses memory of its initial state exponentially. More accurately, assume x0 has either distribution μ1 or μ2 and call μ1n and μ2n, respectively, the corresponding distributions of xn. Our main result states that if μ1 and μ2 are sufficiently regular, then the difference [formula] tends to zero at an exponential rate with increasing n, provided f is a suitable test function. This type of weak convergence is natural due to the invertibility of the dynamics: the supports of the measures μ1n and μ2n will never overlap unless they did so initially. Instead, they tend to concentrate increasingly on unstable manifolds due to the contracting direction of the maps Ti and then wind wildly around the phase space M due to the expansion on unstable manifolds. Hence, one cannot hope to identify ever-increasing portions of μ1n and μ2n unless one first integrates against a test function that possesses some regularity along stable manifolds. In spite of the convergence of the difference μ1n  -  μ2n for arbitrary initial measures μ1 and μ2, in general the limit measures lim n  →    ∞μin do not exist individually even in the weak sense. It is more appropriate to think that all regular measures are attracted by a moving target in the space of measures.

Finally, let us point out that in the real world, where observations take place on finite time scales, one is not interested in the excessively distant future. To underline this, the results here are finite-time results, in which the sequence [formula] is assumed to be known only up to some finite value of n. The lack of infinite future leads to certain technical problems to be discussed and dealt with below.

In [\cite=OttStenlundYoung] analogous results were obtained for uniformly expanding and piecewise expanding maps. The situation of the present paper is markedly more complicated because our Anosov diffeomorphisms have a contracting direction. Some steps in this direction were taken in [\cite=AyyerStenlund], where mixing for certain arbitrarily ordered compositions of finitely many toral automorphisms was established. There are other studies which contain at least some elements that in spirit are not very far from our setting. In [\cite=Bakhtin1] [\cite=Bakhtin2] compositions of hyperbolic maps -- all close to each other -- were studied and limit theorems proved. An abstract operator theoretic approach for obtaining limit theorems was described in [\cite=ConzeRaugi], with applications to piecewise expanding interval maps. Moreover, symbolic dynamics of non-stationary subshifts of finite type was considered in [\cite=ArnouxFisher]. An extensive literature on random compositions of maps exists. It will not be reviewed here, as the present paper concerns quite a different type of questions. Nevertheless, some of the techniques developed below should be useful in the context of random maps as well.

Structure of the paper

In Section [\ref=subsec:Anosov_comp] we describe the precise setting of the paper. In particular, we explain what kind of compositions of maps we are interested in and discuss our standing assumptions. After that, the main result of the paper, Theorem [\ref=thm:weak_conv], is formulated. Section [\ref=subsec:standard] introduces some basic concepts needed throughout the paper. The Introduction ends with Section [\ref=subsec:contributions], which discusses what the author perceives as the most important contributions of the paper, including a technical version of Theorem [\ref=thm:weak_conv].

In Section [\ref=sec:foliations] we define finite-time stable and unstable distributions and stable foliations needed to keep track of the dynamics with appropriate accuracy. We also prove quantitative results concerning the distortion effects of the dynamics. Subsequently, we are able to define in a meaningful way finite-time holonomy maps which satisfy useful bounds.

In Section [\ref=sec:coupling] we formulate the central result of the paper -- the Coupling Lemma. It is then used to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:equidistr], which subsequently implies Theorem [\ref=thm:weak_conv]. The Coupling Lemma itself is proved in Section [\ref=sec:coupling_proof], which is the most technical part of the paper.

To maintain the flow of the discussion, some key technical facts have been separated from the main text and presented in the appendices. They are cited in the text as needed. Appendix [\ref=app:Holder] is of special interest; there we prove the uniform Hölder regularity of the finite-time stable and unstable distributions introduced in Section [\ref=sec:foliations].

Compositions of Anosov diffeomorphisms

Fix [formula]. For each 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q, let [formula] be a topologically transitive C2 Anosov diffeomorphism on the 2-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold M with metric d embedded in an ambient space [formula] . The Riemannian volume is denoted by m. The map [formula] admits an invariant Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure, μq, which is mixing; see for example [\cite=BressaudLiverani]. In general, such a measure is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Riemannian volume. Let [formula] be disk neighborhoods of small radii εq > 0 in the C2 topology. Now, pick a finite sequence (Tn) of Anosov diffeomorphisms such that

[formula]

where [formula]. For technical reasons, also set [formula] for all n  >  nQ. We assume that the intervals Iq are long enough:

[formula]

where the numbers Nq, 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q, will be assumed suitably large. We will be interested in the statistical properties of the compositions

[formula]

The maps [formula] serve as successive guiding points which the sequence (Tn) follows in the space of Anosov diffeomorphisms, spending a sufficiently long time Nq in each neighborhood Uq before moving on to Uq + 1. We also write [formula] for m  ≤  n.

Each [formula] admits a unique continuous invariant splitting of the tangent bundle: for each x∈M, [formula], where the 1-dimensional linear spaces Eu,sq,x depend continuously on the base point x, [formula] and [formula]. In fact, in our 2-dimensional setting, the dependence on the base point is C1 + α for some α > 0, because the so-called bunching conditions [\cite=KatokHasselblatt] are satisfied. The families Euq  =  {Euq,x} and Esq  =  {Esq,x} are called the unstable and stable distributions of [formula], respectively, and their integral curves are called unstable and stable manifolds of [formula], respectively. By continuity, the angle between Euq and Esq at each point is uniformly bounded away from zero. The maps also have continuous families of unstable cones, {Cuq,x}, and stable cones, {Csq,x}. These can be defined by setting for some constants aq > 0 such that

[formula] and [formula] if n  ≥  pq,

[formula] if v∈Cuq,x and [formula] if v∈Csq,x,

for constants pq  ≥  1, [formula], and [formula].

We make the following standing assumptions:

pq  =  1 in condition (C1) above.

[formula] and [formula] for all T∈Uq.

There exist constants 0 < Cq < 1 and Λq > 1 such that, if each Ti∈Uq for a fixed q, [formula] if v∈Cuq,x and [formula] if v∈Csq,x.

[formula] if T∈Uq + 1 and [formula] if T∈Uq.

The numbers aq can be assumed small.

Given 0 < γ < 1, we say that a function [formula] is a γ-Hölder continuous observable, if

We are now in position to state our main theorem, which is reminiscent of weak convergence of measures in probability theory.

There exist constants 0 < η < 1 and C > 0, for which the following statements hold. Let dμi  =  ρidm (i = 1,2) be two probability measures, absolutely continuous with respect to the Riemannian volume m, such that ρi are strictly positive and η-Hölder continuous on M. If f is continuous, then where Af(n) = o(1). Given 0 < γ < 1, there exist constants 0 < θγ < 1 and Cγ = Cγ(ρ1,ρ2) > 0 such that, if f is γ-Hölder, then Af(n) = CγBfθnγ with Bf  =  C( sup f -  inf f)  +  |f|γ. In either case, the various constants do not depend on the choice of the sequence (Ti), in particular its length nQ, as long as the earlier assumptions hold and the numbers Nq appearing in [\eqref=eq:time] are large enough. Among the constants only Cγ depends on the densities ρi, and in fact it only depends on the Hölder constants of ln ρi.

In other words, if f is continuous, the difference between the two integrals [formula] is eventually arbitrarily small, assuming there are sufficiently many maps in the finite sequence (Ti) of nQ maps. The latter means that at least one of the intervals Iq in [\eqref=eq:time] is sufficiently long, and consequently nQ is large. What is more, the rate of convergence is exponential, if f is Hölder continuous. By approximation, one can get an o(1) estimate also for general continuous densities ρi.

Let us emphasize once more that despite such convergence or pairs of measures, it does not make any sense to speak of a limit measure, because the maps Tn keep evolving with time -- possibly drifting very far from T1. Furthermore, all observations in our theorems are restricted to times not exceeding (the arbitrarily large but finite) nQ.

Theorem [\ref=thm:weak_conv] remains true for much more general, SRB-like, initial measures. It is enough that each measure μi can be disintegrated relative to a measurable partition Pi such that the partition elements W∈Pi are smooth unstable curves with respect to the cones {Cu1,x} with uniformly bounded curvatures and the conditional measures μi|W have regular densities. See below for details.

In our formulation of the theorem, the convergence rate θγ is constant. The latter depends on the reference diffeomorphisms [formula], 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q. A sharper, variable, convergence rate that depends also on the time interval Iq that n belongs to, can be deduced from the proof.

We finish the section by discussing Assumptions (A) and how they could be relaxed.

Assumption (A0) is one of convenience; we could as well assume that [formula] is sufficiently close to [formula], but have opted for a streamlined presentation. Assumptions (A1) and (A2) state that compositions of maps belonging to Uq have similar hyperbolicity properties as powers of [formula]. The following lemma is proved after a few paragraphs:

Assumptions (A1) and (A2) are satisfied if εq is sufficiently small.

Assumption (A3) guarantees that hyperbolicity prevails when a transition from Uq to Uq + 1 occurs. The first part of (A3) could be relaxed by replacing the map T∈Uq + 1 by sufficiently long compositions [formula] of maps with each Ti∈Uq + 1: given a sufficiently large rq > 0, [formula] if n  ≥  rq and Ti∈Uq + 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. The assumption is then satisfied, for example, if [formula] and if εq is small, for all q. However, Uq and Uq + 1 need not overlap or even be close to each other, as most vectors in the tangent space TxM get eventually mapped by [formula] into Cuq + 1,Tnx if each Ti∈Uq + 1 and if εq + 1 is small. Similar remarks hold for the second part of (A3). This way, the sequence (Tn) used to build up the compositions [\eqref=eq:composition] might, without affecting our analysis, involve occasional long jumps from one neighborhood Uq to the next, as long as the number of steps |Iq| spent in each neighborhood Uq, see [\eqref=eq:time], is sufficiently large.

Assumption (A4) means that the cones can be assumed narrow. This is not restrictive for our purposes either, as it follows from (C2) that arbitrarily narrow cones can be treated by considering sufficiently long compositions of maps in a given Uq with a sufficiently small εq.

Recapitulating, it would be adequate to assume that the properties above hold eventually, for sufficiently long compositions of maps, and in this case the assumptions are very natural and easily fulfilled. For technical convenience and notational ease, we assume from now on that all the nice properties hold immediately, after the application of just one map.

We will prove the claims for unstable cones, going forward in time. Similar arguments work for the stable cones, by reversing time.

(A1): Suppose T∈Uq. By the chain rule [formula], where [formula]. By the continuity of the cones with respect to the base point and the fact that [formula] , we have [formula], provided εq is sufficiently small. Compactness guarantees that εq can be chosen independently of x.

(A2): For each i and x, [formula], where [formula]. We can bound [formula]. If εq is sufficiently small, we have [formula] for v∈Cuq,x. Now assume N = N(q) is so large that [formula]. Here N depends neither on x, on v, nor on the choice of the maps Ti∈Uq. Let us set [formula]. The uniform estimate [formula] holds with some cq = cq(N) for 1  ≤  n  <  N. Now, assume n  =  kN + l, 0  ≤  l < N. Then [formula]. Thus, we can take Cq  =  cq  /  ΛNq.

Unstable curves with smooth measures

We call a smooth curve W  ⊂  M unstable with respect to {Cuq,x} if its tangent space at each point x∈W is contained in the unstable cone Cuq,x, i.e., TxW  ⊂  Cuq,x. Stable curves are defined similarly. Let W(x,y)  ⊂  W denote the subcurve of W whose end points are x,y∈W. The length |W| of a curve W is given by where mW stands for the measure mW on W induced by the Riemannian metric. Also, let κ(W) stand for the maximum curvature of W: if u(x) is a unit tangent vector of W at x depending smoothly on x, then [formula].

It is convenient to consider curves of bounded length and curvature only. Hence, we introduce two length caps, L and [formula], and a curvature cap K, and say that a smooth curve W is standard, if [formula] and if κ(TnW)  ≤  K for all n  ≥  0. If |W| > L, we can always "standardize" it by cutting it into shorter subcurves. If an unstable curve is of length less than [formula], it will eventually grow under the application of the sequence (Ti), such that [formula] for sufficiently large n. The dynamics also flattens unstable curves, such that κ(TnW)  ≤  K for all sufficiently large n, even if κ(W) > K. We will confirm these last two facts in the following. Finally, there are no discontinuities which would introduce more short curves under the dynamics by cutting longer ones. Taking these considerations into account it is quite natural to commit to the mild constraint that all curves are standard curves to begin with. This will help keep the somewhat technical discussion as clear as possible.

A standard pair (W,ν) (w.r.t. {Cuq,x}) consist of a standard unstable curve (w.r.t. {Cuq,x}), W, and a probability measure, ν, on W. The measure ν is assumed absolutely continuous with respect to mW on W with a density, ρ, that is regular in the following sense: for some global constants [formula] and [formula] to be fixed later ,

[formula]

for all x,y∈W. In particular, which implies [formula], since [formula]. Moreover, [formula]. If W'  ⊂  W, we obtain by using the previous facts that ≤ ν(W') ≤ e . Hence, if [formula] and W',W''  ⊂  W,

[formula]

Formally, a standard family is a family [formula] of standard pairs together with a probability factor measure [formula] on the (possibly uncountable) index set [formula] and a probability measure [formula] satisfying for each Borel measurable set B  ⊂  M. The measure [formula] is supported on [formula] and for each Borel measurable function f on M. In Theorem [\ref=thm:equidistr] we assume that a standard family is associated to a measurable partition.

A standard family can, for example, consist of just one standard pair {(W,ν)} and the Dirac point mass factor measure δW. Another natural example of a standard family [formula] is obtained by considering an Anosov diffeomorphism and taking as [formula] a measurable partition consisting of unstable manifolds of bounded length and letting the Riemannian volume induce the factor measure and the conditional measures να.

Main contributions

A technical version of our main result is the following theorem. It states that for reasonable initial distributions [formula] and [formula], the images [formula] and [formula] converge exponentially in a weak sense.

There exist constants C > 0 and 0 < ϑ < 1, and 0 < λ < 1, such that the following holds. For any standard families G and E, any γ > 0, and any γ-Hölder observable f , where, The various constants do not depend on the choice of the sequence (Ti), in particular its length nQ, as long as the earlier assumptions hold and the numbers Nq appearing in [\eqref=eq:time] are large enough.

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:equidistr], we prove the earlier Theorem [\ref=thm:weak_conv], which is stated in terms of less technical notions and is closer in spirit to the weak convergence of probability theory.

The proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm:equidistr] and [\ref=thm:weak_conv] rely on a coupling method that has its roots in probability theory. It was carried over to the study of dynamical systems by Lai-Sang Young [\cite=Young] [\cite=MasmoudiYoung] who used it to prove exponential decay of correlations for Sinai Billiards and uniqueness of invariant measures for randomly perturbed dissipative parabolic PDEs. Bressaud and Liverani [\cite=BressaudLiverani] also used coupling to give explicit estimates on the decay of correlations for Anosov diffeomorphisms. The present paper takes advantage of a version of Young's coupling method introduced by Dmitry Dolgopyat and Nikolai Chernov [\cite=ChernovDolgopyatBBM] [\cite=Chernov-BilliardsCoupling].

A considerable amount of work is devoted to obtaining uniform bounds, which is more involved than in the case of iterating a single map. A central issue is that the finite sequences [formula] of maps that we consider do not possess stable and unstable manifolds, because defining such objects requires an infinite future and an infinite past, respectively. Thus, we have to resort to artificial, finite-time, foliations that describe the dynamics sufficiently faithfully but are by no means unique. Moreover, in the single map case the regularity properties of the foliations of the manifold into stable and unstable manifolds play an important role. Our construction should therefore also yield regular foliations. In addition, the amount of regularity must not depend on the choice of the sequence [formula] (as long as Q  ≥  1 and the maps [formula], 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q, have been fixed and the earlier assumptions are satisfied), since the goal is to prove the uniform convergence result in Theorem [\ref=thm:equidistr].

At the heart of Dolgopyat's and Chernov's method lies the Coupling Lemma (corresponding to Lemma [\ref=lem:coupling]). In its proof, one constructs a special reference set called the magnet. By mixing, any standard pair will ultimately cross the magnet as if it was attracted by the latter. Once two standard pairs cross the magnet, parts of them can be coupled to each other using the stable foliation. In this paper, we generalize the idea by considering time-dependent magnets and time-dependent, finite-time, foliations for the coupling construction.

Distortions and holonomy maps

Stable foliations Wn

As pointed out above, there is no well-defined sequence of stable foliations associated to the finite sequence [formula] of maps. A way around this is to try to augment the sequence with a fake future consisting of infinitely many maps -- in our case [formula] for n > nQ -- and to consider the uniquely defined stable foliations of the resulting infinite sequence of maps. This sequence of stable foliations naturally depends on the chosen future and it is not a priori clear whether they have very much to do with the finite-time dynamics (1  ≤  n  ≤  nQ) which is the only thing we are interested in.

For a sequence (Ti) satisfying the earlier assumptions, we can define a sequence of stable distributions on the manifold M, by pulling back the stable distribution EsQ,x of [formula]. More precisely, let us first define Enx  =  EsQ,x for n  ≥  nQ + 1 and then With this definition, Assumptions (A1) and (A3) guarantee that [formula] for n + 1∈Iq and 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q. By Assumption (A4), the angle between Enx and Esq,x can be assumed uniformly small, for n∈Iq and 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q.

The distributions En above are the tangent distributions to the stable foliations Wn of the sequences (Ti)i > n. If WsQ,x is the stable leaf of [formula] at x, then Wnx  =  WsQ,x for n  ≥  nQ + 1 and Notice that y∈Wnx if and only if lim N  →    ∞d(TN,n + 1x,TN,n + 1y) = 0.

For technical reasons, we also define Fnx  =  Eu1,x for n  ≤  0 and then

[formula]

Assumptions (A1) and (A3) guarantee that [formula] for n∈Iq and 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q. By Assumption (A4), the angle between Fnx and Euq,x can be assumed uniformly small, for n∈Iq and 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q. The distributions Fn are in fact the unstable distributions of the sequence (Ti) augmented with the past [formula] for i  ≤  0. They serve as Hölder continuous reference distributions that allow us to accurately compare different unstable vectors.

In Appendix [\ref=app:Holder] we show that the distributions Fn and En for all n are uniformly Hölder continuous.

Distortion

It is necessary to control the distortion and growth of curves under maps T. Given a curve W we denote by JWT the Jacobian of the restriction of T to W. If v is any nonzero tangent vector of W at x, then

Fix 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and let Ti∈Uq for each i. If W is an unstable curve with respect to {Cuq,x}, setting [formula],

[formula]

If [formula] are stable curves with respect to {Csq,x}, then

[formula]

Since [formula], where vx is a unit vector tangent to W at x, it suffices to observe that [formula] in the "unstable case" and [formula] in the "stable case".

Fix 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and let Ti∈Uq for each i. There exist K1 and, for any K' > 0, K2(K') and nκ(K'), such that holds if W is an unstable curve with respect to {Cuq,x} and κ(W)  ≤  K'. Notice that K1  ≤  K2 is independent of K'.

We can now fix some K' and set K = K2(K') in the definition of standard pairs. In particular, this means that any unstable curve W with length between [formula] and L and curvature κ(W)  ≤  K' is a standard curve.

Let W be an unstable curve and γ its parametrization by arc length, such that [formula] with x = γ(t). Note [formula]. The curvature of W at x is the length of Setting V = DTnu, [formula] is the unit tangent of TnW at y = Tnx. The curvature of TnW at y is thus obtained from Here the chain rule Dx(v(y))  =  Dv(y)DTn(x) was used. Now such that or compactly

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is the component of DVu orthogonal to v and hence [formula]. Furthermore, as [formula], which we recognize to be the curvature of W at x, we have

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:exp_comp] and [formula], we see from [\eqref=eq:curv_image] and [\eqref=eq:DVu] that

[formula]

Fix an N such that (CqΛNq)- 1C# < 1. Iterating [\eqref=eq:curvature_rec], A uniform bound max 0  ≤  l < Nκ(TlW)  ≤  a + b  ·  κ(W) is also obtained, so we are done.

If W carries a measure ν with density ρ, then TnW carries the measure Tnν whose density, which we denote Tnρ, is For controlling the regularity of such densities, we have the following result.

Fix 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and let Ti∈Uq for each i. If T- 1nW is a standard unstable curve with respect to {Cuq,x} for all 0  ≤  n  ≤  N and if x,y∈W, then Here [formula] is a constant that do not depend on W or the choice of (Ti).

We first prove that the distortion factor of any map T∈Uq is close to that of [formula]. To this end, let W be an unstable curve with respect to {Cuq,x}, x∈W, and v a unit vector tangent to W at x. Then Next, let γ parametrize W(x,y) according to arc length. Because and because the curvature [formula] for all standard unstable curves, where [formula] is independent of the choice of T. The desired estimate follows. Indeed, writing x- j  =  (Tn,n - j + 1)- 1x, y- j  =  (Tn,n - j + 1)- 1y, and W- j  =  (Tn,n - j + 1)- 1W (with [formula]), Moreover, by [\eqref=eq:growth_bound], |W- j(x- j,y- j)|  ≤  C- 1qΛ- jq|W(x,y)|.

Image of a standard family

Fix 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and let Ti∈Uq for each i. Let G = (W,ν) be a standard pair with respect to {Cuq,x} and assume that [formula] satisfies For [formula], denote by Wi the (finitely many) standard pieces of the image TnW after it has been standardized by cutting into shorter pieces and split the image measure Tnν into the sum [formula], where νi is a probability measure on Wi and [formula]. Then each (Wi,νi) is a standard pair w.r.t. {Cuq,x}.

We only need to check that the density, ρi, of νi is regular. For x∈Wi, ρi(x) = JWiT- 1n(x)  ·  ρ(T- 1nx) / ci. Thus, for any pair x,y∈Wi, We used Lemma [\ref=lem:distortion_loc] and also Wi(x,y)  =  Tn(W(T- 1nx,T- 1ny)) together with Lemma [\ref=lem:growth_loc].

Thus, Gn  =  {(Wi,νi)} is a standard family equipped with the factor measure λGn(i) = ci. More generally, if G is a standard family, Gn obtained by processing each standard pair in a similar fashion is a standard family.

Holonomy maps

A holonomy map is a device needed in the coupling construction for coupling some of the probability masses on different points. Let W1 and W2 be two unstable curves (w.r.t. {Cu1,x}) connected by the stable foliation W0. In other words, for each point x∈W1 the leaf W0x intersects W2 and conversely for each point y∈W2 the leaf W0y intersects W1. We assume that the curves Wi are close enough and not too long, so that the connected pairs (x,y)∈W1  ×  W2 are uniquely defined by demanding that the connecting leaf be shorter than a small number [formula]. Then the holonomy map [formula] is defined by sliding along the leaf: [formula]. Since the images TnWi are connected by the stable foliation Wn, one can define the holonomy map [formula].

Notice that if the curves Wi carry measures νi that are compatible in the sense that [formula], then the images TnWi carry compatible measures: [formula]. This will guarantee in the following that once some of the masses on two points have been coupled to each other, they remain coupled.

The holonomy map [formula] is said to be absolutely continuous, if the measure [formula] is absolutely continuous with respect to the measure mW1. In this case the Jacobian, which measures distortion under the holonomy map, is defined as the Radon-Nikodym derivative [formula]. The change-of-variables formula for integrals is [formula] with [formula] . For any x∈W1, we have [formula]. It is elementary to check that if [formula] is absolutely continuous, then [formula] inherits this property via the identity

[formula]

By reversing the argument, we see that if [formula] is absolutely continuous for some m, then [formula] is absolutely continuous and [\eqref=eq:Jac_decomp] holds for all values of n  ≥  0.

Let [formula] be as above. It is absolutely continuous. Moreover, there exist constants c1  ≥  1 and 0 < μ < 1, independent of the curves W1 and W2 and the choice of the sequence (Ti)nQi = 1, such that

[formula]

holds for x∈W1 and 0  ≤  n  ≤  nQ. In particular, [formula].

As a curiosity, [\eqref=eq:holonomy_Jac_bound] continues to hold for n > nQ since [formula]. In particular, the precise value of [formula] could be obtained as the limit [formula]. However, we only care about n  ≤  nQ. What is important above is that c1 and μ do not change when the lengths of the intervals Iq in [\eqref=eq:time] and hence the value of nQ are increased arbitrarily.

Denote xn  =  Tnx and [formula] for x∈W1, and Wni  =  TnWi for i = 1,2. We also write [formula]. Since [formula] and Wn - 1x  =  WsQ,x for all x, for all n > nQ, we know the following: [formula] inherits absolute continuity from [formula], [\eqref=eq:Jac_decomp] holds for all n  ≥  0 as explained above, and [formula]. Therefore, with the aid of the chain rule [formula], we conclude that By Assumption (A3), we may use Lemma [\ref=lem:coalesce] on each of the time intervals Iq. Since | ln z|  ≤   max (z - 1,z- 1 - 1) for all z > 0, we see that [\eqref=eq:coalesce] implies [\eqref=eq:holonomy_Jac_bound]:

There exist [formula] and [formula], such that the following holds. Let W1 and W2 be standard unstable curves connected by the stable foliation W0 as above. For x1,x2∈W1 such that |W1(x1,x2)|  ≤  1,

Denote xn  =  Tnx for all x in Wn1  =  TnW1. We also set [formula], yni  =  Tnyi, and Wn2  =  TnW2. By [\eqref=eq:Jac_decomp], for all m. The last sum can be bounded with the aid of [\eqref=eq:holonomy_Jac_bound]. Using the chain rule [formula] Lemma [\ref=lem:distortion_loc] and the bounds [\eqref=eq:growth_bound], Similarly, for any m, Notice from the definition of C and Λ̄ that they are independent of the curves Wi and of the sequence (Ti). Because [formula],

Finally, choose [formula]. Then μm  =  |W1(x1,x2)|, Λ̄m  =  |W1(x1,x2)|ln Λ̄  /   ln μ, and

Coupling Lemma and the proof of Theorems [\ref=thm:equidistr] and [\ref=thm:weak_conv]

Let (W,ν) be a standard pair and dν  =  ρ  dmW. We will be interested in densities of the form τρ where τ:W  →  [0,1] is a function. These can be considered as portions of the measure ν. In practice, we will replace W by the rectangle Ŵ  =  W  ×  [0,1] with base W and dν by the measure [formula], where dt denotes the Lebesgue measure on

[formula]

Proof of the Coupling Lemma

Outline of the proof

The idea of the proof is to construct special tiny rectangles, called magnets, which can be thought to attract unstable curves. Mixing guarantees that a small fraction, say 1 percent, of any high enough iterate of any unstable curve will ultimately lie on a magnet. Once two unstable curves from two different standard families cross a magnet, we are able to couple a fraction of their masses by connecting some of their points lying on the magnet with very short stable manifolds. This has to be done with due care, because the resulting coupling has to be measure preserving.

The process is then repeated recursively, and so the construction of the coupling map Θ and the coupling time function Υ is recursive. It can be shown that after a fixed finite number of iterates a fixed fraction of the remaining masses can always be coupled, so that the measures on the unstable curves can be 'drained' at an exponential rate.

Since we are dealing with compositions of diffeomorphisms from the sequence (Ti) rather than iterates of a single diffeomorphism, we need to use time-dependent magnets. For n∈Iq, Tn∈Uq, and the magnet to be used should reflect the structure of the reference diffeomorphism [formula]. In our time-dependent, finite time, setting it is not even a priori clear what coupling should mean. We choose to construct a coupling via the stable foliations Wn that vary from one point in time to the next. As mentioned earlier, these foliations are artificial in the sense that they depend on the artificial future [formula] for times n > nQ although in reality we only consider the compositions [formula] for n  ≤  nQ. We then have to pay special attention to uniformity: our convergence rates, etc., should depend neither on the particular value of nQ nor on the particular finite sequence [formula] as long as the reference automorphisms [formula] have been chosen and the earlier assumptions on [formula] are being respected.

Magnets and crossings

In this subsection 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q is fixed for good. Unstable curves and standard pairs are to be understood as being defined with respect to the cone family {Cuq,x} with q fixed.

Consider the Anosov diffeomorphism [formula]. A 'rectangle', [formula], is a closed and connected region bounded by two stable manifolds and two unstable manifolds of [formula]. These are called the s- and u-sides of the rectangle, respectively. Recalling that Wsq,x denotes the stable leaf of [formula] at x, we also assume that the size of the rectangle in the stable direction satisfies [formula].

We say that an unstable curve W crosses the rectangle properly, if

W crosses [formula] completely, i.e., [formula] contains a connected curve W' connecting the two s-sides of the rectangle, and

both components of [formula] are of length strictly greater than [formula],

both hold. In other words, a crossing is proper if the curve crosses the rectangle completely and there is a guaranteed amount of excess length beyond each s-side of the rectangle. Here [formula] is the lower bound on the length of a standard curve. Finally, an unstable curve W crosses the rectangle super-properly, if (P1),

both components of [formula] are of length strictly greater than [formula], and

each [formula] divides the curve [formula] in a ratio strictly between 1 / 10 and 9 / 10.

all hold. Thus, in a super-proper crossing there is more guaranteed excess length than in a proper crossing and the curve also stays well clear of the u-sides.

There exists a finite set of rectangles, [formula], such that each standard unstable curve crosses at least one of the rectangles super-properly.

Every closed standard curve crosses some rectangle [formula] super-properly. Since crossing a rectangle [formula] super-properly is an open condition in the Hausdorff metric, the set [formula] of all closed standard curves crossing [formula] super-properly is an open set. The collection formed by all the sets [formula] is an open cover of the space of closed standard curves equipped with the Hausdorff metric. The latter space is compact. We can therefore pick a finite subcover and the corresponding rectangles.

We now pick arbitrarily one of the rectangles [formula]. This special rectangle, that we will denote by [formula], will be called a magnet. It will serve as a reference set on which points will be coupled.

Fix n  ≥  1. By taking εq sufficiently small (depending on n) the following holds. If W is an unstable curve and [formula] crosses [formula] super-properly, then TnW crosses [formula] properly, provided each Ti∈Uq.

For any point x, we have the bound [formula].

If W is an unstable curve and n is fixed, let Wqn,i, [formula], be the connected components of [formula], that correspond to super-proper crossings. That is, each Wqn,i is a subset of a longer curve [formula] which crosses [formula] super-properly and [formula].

There exist a subrectangle [formula] and a number s'  ≥  1 such that the following holds. Assume that W is an unstable curve that crosses a rectangle [formula] properly, n  ≥  s', and [formula]. Every component of [formula] that intersects [formula] intersects Wqn,i for precisely one value of the index [formula].

In words, each intersection of [formula] with [formula] yields a super-proper crossing of [formula], as long as n is large enough.

We assume that the magnet [formula] is so small that the leaves of the unstable foliation of [formula] are almost parallel lines on [formula]. This can be guaranteed by considering only sufficiently small rectangles in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:rectangles]. Now, choose [formula] to be a rectangle whose distance to the u-sides of [formula] is sufficiently large; say each [formula] divides the curve [formula] in a ratio between 1 / 5 and 4 / 5. As [formula] is one-to-one, the components of [formula] are disjoint. Assuming s' is large, these components are very thin strips, almost aligned with the unstable foliation. Pick such a component and assume that it intersects [formula]. It is a safe distance away from the u-sides of the magnet. Inside this component lies a piece V of the curve [formula]. The piece V has to extend to a super-proper crossing of [formula], because W crosses [formula] properly and because n1 is large. Thus, V is actually a subcurve of one of the Wqn,i.

There exist numbers d'' > 0 and s''  ≥  1 such that if (W,ν) is a standard pair and n  ≥  s'', then [formula].

In other words, the fraction of W that will cross the magnet [formula] super-properly after n steps is at least d''.

Fix a k such that W crosses [formula] properly. This is possible by Lemma [\ref=lem:rectangles]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:rect_intersect_rect], if a component of [formula] intersects the subrectangle [formula], it is crossed by the curve component Wqn,i for precisely one value of the index [formula]. In this case let [formula] denote the former component of [formula]. Thus [formula] is only defined for a subset [formula] of indices. We have [formula] if n  ≥  s'' and s'' is large. The last step in the estimate follows from mixing of the invariant measure μq. The third step relies on the absolute continuity with bounded Jacobians of the holonomy maps of [formula] as well as on the regularity of ν and of the conditional measures of μq on the unstable leaves of [formula]. To finish, notice that [formula], since the interiors of [formula] and [formula] are nonempty.

For an unstable curve W, let Wn,i now be the connected components of [formula], labeled by i, that correspond to proper crossings. That is, each Wn,i is a subset of a longer curve [formula] which crosses [formula] properly and [formula].

There exist numbers d'0 > 0 and s0'  ≥  1 such that the following holds. Let Ti∈Uq for each i and (W,ν) be a standard pair. If n  ≥  s0', then [formula].

Fix [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:standard_image], (TmW,Tmν) can be broken into a finite collection of standard pairs (Wj,νj) such that [formula] and [formula], where 0 < νj < 1 and [formula]. For each j, by Lemma [\ref=lem:sp_crossing], there is a finite collection of disjoint (minimal) subcurves Vj,k  ⊂  Wj such that [formula] crosses the magnet [formula] super-properly. Moreover, [formula] and, by Lemma [\ref=lem:super_to_proper], the images Tm + s'',m + 1Vj,k cross the magnet [formula] properly. We also have [formula]. Let us relabel the collection of the subcurves T- 1mVj,k  ⊂  W by Ul. We have so far shown that [formula] and that Tm + s''Ul crosses the magnet [formula] properly.

We are almost done, but we still need to truncate each Ul to a subcurve Ũl so that [formula] and argue that [formula] for some constant α > 0. Such a truncation amounts to choosing the subcurve ṽj,k  =  TmŨl of Vj,k  ⊂  Wj so that [formula]. Now νj(ṽj,k)  ≥  ανj(Vj,k) follows from two observation:

|ṽj,k| is bounded uniformly away from zero, because Tm + s'',m + 1ṽj,k crosses [formula] completely.

[formula] is bounded uniformly from above, because [formula] was assumed to be as small as possible (for a super-properly crossing curve). Therefore [formula] is bounded uniformly from above.

Indeed, it is implied that |ṽj,k| / |Vj,k|  ≥  α' for some α'∈(0,1] so that, by estimate [\eqref=eq:density_comp], νj(ṽj,k) / νj(Vj,k)  ≥  D- 1α' for all j,k.

Notice that only s'' affected the size of εq. This happened when Lemma [\ref=lem:super_to_proper] was used.

Time-dependent magnets

For the rest of the section, let (Ti) be a sequence of the form described in the Introduction, which is not confined to a neighborhood Uq of any one map [formula].

The Coupling Lemma needs to hold for the compositions in [\eqref=eq:composition]. For this reason we cannot use the same magnet for all times. Moreover, the stable foliation Wn that we will use to couple points (more correctly some of the probability masses carried by these points) on the magnets changes with time. This will guarantee that what has aleady been coupled will always remain coupled. Therefore, we need to introduce the following time-dependent magnets: For every [formula] and every n∈Iq, define In other words, [formula] consists of those leaves of Wn that connect the u-sides of [formula] and are entirely inside [formula].

We say that an unstable curve W crosses [formula] properly if n∈Iq and W crosses [formula] properly. Assuming that the cones Csq,x are narrow enough, [formula] is close to [formula], and we have [formula].

Assume that W crosses the magnet [formula] properly and that W carries the measure dν  =  ρ  dmW, where ρ satisfies [\eqref=eq:regular_density]. Then, for all n∈Iq,

By [\eqref=eq:regular_density], [formula] for any [formula]. In particular, we can average the left side over [formula] and the right side over [formula], obtaining [formula]. Since [formula] has small diameter, the exponential factor is close to 1. For n∈Iq, we also have [formula].

For a standard family with respect to {Cu1,x}, [formula], let Wα,n,i be the connected components of [formula] that correspond to proper crossings, and introduce the notation

Next, we generalize Corollary [\ref=cor:sp_crossing] of Lemma [\ref=lem:sp_crossing].

There exist numbers s0  ≥  1 and d0 > 0, such that the following holds. If (Ti) is a sequence of the general form described in the Introduction and [formula] a standard family with respect to {Cu1,x} then, for 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and nq - 1 + s0  ≤  n  ≤  nq,

In other words, there are time windows for n, such that a significant fraction of the image under Tn of the standard family G lies on the magnet [formula], ready to be coupled.

Fixing some 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and k∈Iq, Lemma [\ref=lem:sf_crossing] can be applied to the shifted sequence (Ti)i  ≥  k and [formula] a standard family with respect to {Cuq,x}. Then, if k - 1 + s0  ≤  n  ≤  nq, as well as if nq' - 1 + s0  ≤  n  ≤  nq' for some [formula], at least a d0-fraction of its image under Tn,k lies on the magnet [formula] as a result of proper crossings.

The s0' in Corollary [\ref=cor:sp_crossing] depends on q. We take s0 larger than the maximum of these numbers over 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q. If nq - 1 + s0  ≤  n  ≤  nq, and if s0 is taken sufficiently larger than s0', then the image of G under Tnq - 1 + s0 - s0' after standardizing the curves becomes a standard family with respect to {Cuq,x}. Applying Corollary [\ref=cor:sp_crossing] to this standard family and the map Tn,nq - 1 + s0 - s0' + 1 yields a lower bound on the [formula]-measure of proper crossings of [formula]. From this we infer a lower bound on the proper crossings of [formula] by the regularity of densities with the aid of Lemma [\ref=lem:mini_magnet].

Coupling step

Consider first two standard families, G  =  {(Wα,να)} and E  =  {(Wβ,νβ)}, consisting of one standard pair each.

A good fraction of the images Ts0Wα and Ts0Wβ cross the magnet [formula] properly, so that [formula] and [formula]. Here i and j run through some finite index sets and Ts0ν is the pushforward of ν.

Recall that, for a curve W, Ŵ denotes the rectangle W  ×  [0,1] with base W, and if W carries a measure dν then Ŵ carries the measure [formula]. We will construct a coupling from a subset of [formula] to a subset of [formula] and then show that the complements of these subsets can be coupled recursively.

With small preliminary preparations, we can assume that the cardinalities of the index sets for i and j are the same, so that we can pair each Ŵα,s0,i with precisely one Ŵβ,s0,i. Furthermore, we can assume that their relative masses agree:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the measure on [formula] and [formula]. To see that no generality is lost making such assumptions, consider a rectangle Ŵ with a measure [formula] on it. We can subdivide it into lower rectangles W  ×  Ik, where Ik  ⊂  [0,1] is an interval. Then, each W  ×  Ik is stretched affinely onto W  ×  [0,1] and equipped with the measure dk = |Ik|  d. In other words, we end up with replicas of Ŵ equipped with lowered measures. Such an operation on Ŵ is measure preserving, because the pushforward of the measure |W  ×  Ik under the affine map [formula] is precisely k. Subdividing the rectangles in the families {Ŵα,s0,i} and {Ŵβ,s0,j} as necessary, and relabeling the resulting rectangles, we can tune the number of rectangles as well as their relative weights so as to arrive at the convenient situation described above. Each rectangle [formula] now comes with an associated affine map [formula] (which is the identity if no subdivision of the particular rectangle was necessary). Some of the rectangles will have a common curve as their base on the manifold M, but this is not a matter of concern.

For each fixed i, we can couple a subset of Ŵα,s0,i to a subset of Ŵβ,s0,i as follows. Choose a number τα∈(0,1 / 2] such that

[formula]

Now, fix i. Omitting some ornaments for the sake of readability, let [formula] stand for the holonomy map from Wα,s0,i to Wβ,s0,i associated with the stable foliation Ws0 and denote by [formula] the density of [formula] with respect to [formula].

The subset Ŵα,s0,i' = {(x,t)∈Ŵα,s0,i  :  0  ≤  t  ≤  τα} is coupled to a corresponding subset Ŵβ,s0,i' = {(y,s)∈Ŵβ,s0,i  :  0  ≤  s  ≤  τβ,i(y)} via the coupling map Θs0,i':Ŵα,s0,i'  →  Ŵβ,s0,i':(x,t)  ↦  (y,s) with Notice, however, that τβ,i is not constant but a function. It is given by the consistency rule

[formula]

The expression on the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:tau_beta] equals the pushforward of the density ταρα under the holonomy map, evaluated at [formula]. This guarantees that the coupling is measure preserving: if f is a measurable function [formula], then

We thus have a coupling for each value of the index i, and have therefore managed to couple exactly d0 / 2 units of mass between the families {Ŵα,s0,i} and {Ŵβ,s0,i} via a measure preserving map.

We are now in position to describe the desired coupling map Θ from a subset W̃α  ⊂  Ŵα to a subset W̃β  ⊂  Ŵβ. Define

[formula]

The bijective map Θ:W̃α  →  W̃β is defined for a point (x,t)∈W̃α such that [formula] by the rule Because the affine maps and the couplings Θs0,i' are measure preserving, also Θ is measure preserving; the pushforward of the measure [formula] under Θ is [formula]. In particular, the amount of coupled mass equals [formula]. Finally, the coupling time function [formula] is defined by

We now have a complete description of how to couple d0 / 2 units of mass of any two standard pairs. Thus, given two standard families [formula] and [formula], we can couple a subset W̃α  ⊂  Ŵα with a subset W̃β  ⊂  Ŵβ for any pair [formula], in which case we have να(W̃α) = νβ(W̃β) = d0 / 2. Recall that the index sets [formula] and [formula] carry probability factor measures [formula] and [formula], respectively. They detail how much weight is assigned to standard pairs. Suppose the sets [formula] and [formula] are finite or countable. Splitting off subrectangles if necessary and stretching them affinely onto complete rectangles as described earlier, we can assume that there exists a bijection [formula] that preserves measure, i.e., [formula]. Hence, the coupling map Θ can be constructed from a subset [formula] to a subset [formula] so that measure is preserved and in particular so that [formula]. On [formula] we set Υ = s0. The map Θ can be constructed also for uncountable families, but we omit the details [\cite=Chernov-BilliardsCoupling].

Recovery step

Our task is to couple the remaining points of [formula] to those of [formula] and to extend Θ and Υ to all of Ŵα. We do this recursively. But first we need to prepare the uncoupled parts of the images Fs0Ŵα and Fs0Ŵβ so that they also can undergo the coupling procedure described above.

On the one hand, we have the sets [formula] and [formula] which consist of several rectangles whose base curves do not represent proper crossings of the magnet [formula]. In the worst case, such a base curve is the excess piece of a longer curve that has crossed the magnet [formula] properly, but by definition such excess pieces have a uniform lower bound on their length.

On the other hand, we also have the sets [formula] and [formula] whose bottom complements were coupled already. We stretch each [formula] affinely onto the complete rectangle Ŵα,s0,i, replacing the density ρα on it by (1 - τα)ρα. Similarly, we stretch each [formula] onto Ŵβ,s0,i so that each vertical fiber {s  :  (y,s)∈Ŵβ,s0,i,  τβ,i(y) < s  ≤  1} is mapped affinely onto

[formula]

Exponential tail bound

For the standard families G and E, the first coupling is constructed at time s0, when enough mass of each family is on the magnet [formula]: After every coupling, there is a recovery period of r0 steps, during which curves too short can grow to acceptable (i.e., standard) length and densities get regularized sufficiently. After recovery, another s0 iterations are required to bring enough mass from each standard family on a magnet for the next coupling to be constructed. At the moment of the (k + 1)st coupling, is the fraction of the previously uncoupled mass of each standard family G and E which lies on the magnet [formula] and becomes coupled. Hence,

This finishes the proof of the Coupling Lemma.

Subspace distance

A natural notion of distance between subspaces [formula] is obtained by comparing orthogonal projections to the subspaces in the operator norm:

[formula]

where [formula] are the corresponding orthogonal projections. Notice that

[formula]

We will also measure the distance between 1-dimensional subspaces using the metric

[formula]

where Let u∈A and v∈B be unit vectors such that 〈u,v〉  ≥  0. Then Hence,

Uniform Hölder continuity of the (un)stable distribution

For all n, the distributions En and Fn (see Section [\ref=sec:foliations]) are Hölder continuous with the same parameters, and the latter do not depend on the choice of the sequence (Ti).

Before giving the proof, we need two auxiliary lemmas.

For 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q, there exist constants [formula] and 0 < Cq' < 1 such that the following holds when εq is small enough. If each Ti∈Uq for a fixed q and if [formula], then [formula] for all n  ≥  1 and DxTnv∈Cuq,Tnx for all n  ≥  kq. These statements are uniform in x.

If [formula], we have [formula]. But [formula], and [formula] and [formula]. We have [formula] for n  ≥  kq, if kq is sufficiently large. Because [formula], [formula], and [formula] hold with some C = C(kq) and c = c(kq), we have provided εq is small enough. This estimate shows that DxTkqv∈Cuq,Tkqx.

The uniform estimate [formula] holds with some cq = cq(kq) < 1 for 1  ≤  n  <  kq. If n  =  kq + m, [formula]. Hence, we can set Cq'  =  cqCq  /  Λkqq, so that [formula] for all n  ≥  1.

The next result on linear maps is cited from [\cite=BrinStuck] up to notational changes.

Let L1n and L2n, [formula], be two sequences of linear maps [formula]. Assume that for some b > 0 and δ∈(0,1), Suppose there are two subspaces E1 and E2 of [formula] and constants [formula], [formula] with [formula] such that Then

We generalize the case of a single map found in [\cite=BrinStuck]. As the orthogonal complements [formula] of TxM in [formula] form a smooth distribution [formula] on M, we first prove that the distribution [formula] is Hölder continuous on M and then deduce the Hölder continuity of E0.

Let Px be the orthogonal projection [formula]. It depends smoothly on x. We define This map extends DxTi to a linear map [formula]. Let us also set

Recall from above that E0x  ⊂  Cs1,x. Setting [formula] and Λ  =   min 1  ≤  q  ≤  QΛq, we have by (A2). This translates to

[formula]

By Assumption (A4), we can make the cones so narrow that a vector in TxM perpendicular to E0x lies in the complement of Cs1,x. Setting [formula], Lemma [\ref=lem:attracting_cone] thus yields In other words,

[formula]

Clearly [formula]. For brevity, let us write [formula] and [formula], where T runs over [formula]. Since Ln + 1(x)  =  L(n + 1)(Tnx)Ln(x), As [formula], we obtain the bound

[formula]

with the constant [formula].

The bounds [\eqref=eq:BrinStuck_cond_1a], [\eqref=eq:BrinStuck_cond_1b], and [\eqref=eq:BrinStuck_cond_2] show that all conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem:BrinStuck] are satisfied, if we take L1n  =  Ln(x), L2n  =  Ln(y), [formula], and [formula]. Writing α  =  2 ln Λ / (2 ln b1  +   ln Λ) and K  =  3 max (C- 1,C'- 1)2Λ2  cα, provided [formula].

By compactness of the manifold and smoothness of the distribution [formula], we have [formula] for some L. Hence, by [\eqref=eq:gap_dist] and [\eqref=eq:proj_sum],

Notice that this bound does not depend on the sequence (Ti)i  ≥  1. Moreover, the same upper bound is obtained for each distribution En by disregarding the first n maps and considering the sequence (Ti)i > n instead. The result for Fn is obtained by reversing time.

Inclination Lemma type results

Fix 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q and let Ti∈Uq for each i. There exists a constant C# > 0 such that, for all w∈Cuq,x and all w̃∈TxM with [formula], the vectors wn = DxTnw and w̃n  =  DxTnw̃ satisfy If also w̃∈Cuq,x, the angle between wn and w̃n tends to zero at a uniform exponential rate:

[formula]

for some 0 < c < 1 and C > 0.

We first construct "fake" stable and unstable distributions for finite sequences [formula]. Fix N  ≥  1. First, choose a distribution ẼN such that ẼNx  ⊂  Csq,x for all x. Then define the distributions Ẽn, 0  ≤  n < N, by pulling back: Ẽnx  =  DTn + 1xT- 1n + 1Ẽn + 1Tn + 1x  ⊂  Csq,x. Next, choose a distribution 0 such that 0x  ⊂  Cuq,x for all x. Then set recursively nx  =  DT- 1nxTn  n - 1T- 1nx for n  ≥  1. We will use Ẽnx and nx as coordinate axes. Let [formula] and [formula] be unit vectors oriented so that [formula] and [formula] point in the same direction and [formula] and [formula] point in the same direction.

Recall from Section [\ref=subsec:Anosov_comp] that the angle between Euq,x and Esq,x is uniformly bounded away from zero. In other words, there exists a ψq > 0 such that [formula] for all x∈M. By Assumption (A4), the cones can be assumed narrow enough, so that [formula] for all subspaces U  ⊂  Cuq,x and V  ⊂  Csq,x, and for all x∈M. Because of this, [formula] for all x and all 0  ≤  n  ≤  N. Thus, we have the uniform bounds

[formula]

Now write [formula] and [formula] and estimate, for 0  ≤  n  ≤  N, We have used Assumption (A2) to bound the norms involving DxTn. From [\eqref=eq:length_comp], α̃20,20  ≤  ψ- 1q. As w is an unstable unit vector, |α0| is bounded from below by some Aq > 0. Thus But N was arbitrary, so the bound holds for all n  ≥  0. In particular, C# does not depend on the constructed distributions. A computation also shows that, if both w̃,w∈Cuq,x, then [formula] is of order βnn  /  αnα̃n  ≤  C- 4qΛ- 4nqβ00  /  α0α̃0  ≤  CΛ- 4nq.

Fix 1  ≤  q  ≤  Q, 0 < λ < 1, and δ > 0. Fix N  ≥  1 and Ti∈Uq for 1  ≤  i  ≤  N. Take two points x1,x2 and assume that d(Tnx1,Tnx2) < δλn if 0  ≤  n  ≤  N. Suppose W1,W2 are unstable curves with respect to {Cuq,x} and that xi∈Wi. Then

[formula]

The constants C' > 1 and 0 < μ < 1 are independent of N, of the curves Wi, and of the choice of [formula], as long as the bound on d(Tnx1,Tnx2) continues to hold.

Choose 0x  =  Euq,x and define nx  =  DT- 1nxTn  n - 1T- 1nx for 1  ≤  n  ≤  N. By Lemma [\ref=lem:distr_Holder] , the distributions n belong to a fixed Hölder class, no matter which [formula] and N are chosen. Notice that nx  ⊂  Cuq,x for 0  ≤  n  ≤  N.

Let uni (i = 1,2) stand for a unit tangent vector of TnWi at xni  =  Tnxi. We also write [formula], where Px is the orthogonal projection [formula], which is smooth. We have denoted by Uni the linear subspaces of [formula] spanned by uni and recalled the definition in [\eqref=eq:dist']. The angle between Uni and nxni decays exponentially: [formula] due to [\eqref=eq:dist'] and [\eqref=eq:angle_conv]. Hence, it suffices to prove exponential decay of [formula]. But this follows from Hölder continuity and the assumption d(xn1,xn2) < δλn.
