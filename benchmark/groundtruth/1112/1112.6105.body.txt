On the near-threshold peak structure in the differential cross section of φ-meson photoproduction: indication of a missing resonance with non-negligible strangeness content

Introduction

The φ-meson photoproduction reaction has long been extensively studied. At high energy, diffractive process dominates and it can be well described by t-channel Pomeron (P) exchange [\cite=bauer78] [\cite=donnachie87]. In the low-energy region, the nondiffractive processes of the pseudoscalar (π,η)-meson exchanges are also known to contribute [\cite=bauer78]. Other processes, such as nucleon exchange [\cite=williams98] [\cite=oh01], nucleon resonances [\cite=zhao99] [\cite=titov03], second Pomeron exchange, t-channel scalar meson and glueball exchanges [\cite=titov99] [\cite=titov03], and ss̄-cluster knockout [\cite=titov97] [\cite=titov98] [\cite=oh01] have also been investigated. However, a peak in the differential cross sections of φ photoproduction on protons at forward angles around Eγ  ~  2.0 GeV as recently observed by the LEPS collaboration [\cite=leps05] cannot be explained by the processes mentioned above.

Since a bump in the cross sections is often associated with excitation of resonances, it is then tempting to see if the peak observed in Ref. [\cite=leps05] can be described by a resonance. There exist previous works studying the effects of resonances in s and u channels with masses up to 2 GeV [\cite=zhao99] [\cite=titov03]. Ref. [\cite=zhao99] employs [formula] symmetry within a constituent quark model and included explicitly excited resonances with quantum numbers n  ≤  2. On the other hand, Ref. [\cite=titov03] includes all the known 12 resonances below 2 GeV listed in Particle Data Group [\cite=PDG10], with coupling constants determined by available experimental data [\cite=besch74] [\cite=anciant00] at large momentum transfers. The resonances are found to play significant roles in the polarization observables. Nevertheless, the resonances considered, either listed in PDG table or predicted by some quark model, cannot account for the nonmonotonic behavior as reported in Ref. [\cite=leps05].

In Ref. [\cite=Kiswandhi10], we have tried to explore the possibility on whether such a nonmonotonic behavior could be explained by a postulated resonance by fiat in the neighborhood of observed peak position. We found that, with an addition of a resonance of spin 3/2 to a background mechanism which consists of Pomeron and (π,η)-meson exchanges in t-channel, not only the peak in the forward differential cross section but also the t dependence of differential cross section (DCS) and φ meson decay angular distribution can be well described. Similar attempt was also made in Ref. [\cite=Ozaki09], where the effect of the KΛ(1520) is taken into account in a coupled-channel analysis. Their results preferred a resonance of JP = 1 / 2-. However, the calculation is marred by a mistake in the phase of the Pomeron amplitude.

In this paper, we give the details of our previous analysis [\cite=Kiswandhi10] and present more extensive results of our calculation. In addition, we employ the new LEPS data [\cite=Chang10] which consist of nine spin-density matrix elements measured at three different energies to determine the resonance parameters, instead of the decay angular distributions of the φ meson, which involve only six spin-density matrix elements, taken only at two energies given in Ref. [\cite=leps05], as was done before. The use of a larger data set with better precision should provide a more stringent constraint on the model and give rise to more reliable extracted resonance properties. We also provide an estimation of the strangeness content of the postulated resonance.

This paper is organized as follows. The model used in our analysis, which consists of Pomeron and (π,η)-meson exchanges in t channel, and a postulated resonance is given in Sec. II. The extracted resonance parameters, their possible effects in the polarization observables and ω photoproduction, as well as an estimation of the strangeness content of the resonance, are presented in Sec. III. The summary is given in Sec. IV.

The Model For φ Meson Photoproduction

We first introduce the kinematic variables k, pi, q, and pf for the four-momenta of the incoming photon, initial proton, outgoing φ-meson, and final proton, respectively, with s = (k + pi)2 = (q + pf)2, t = (q - k)2  =  (pf - pi)2, and u = (pf - k)2 = (q - pi)2.

We follow the convention of PDG [\cite=PDG10] and define the invariant amplitude - iM as related to the S-matrix by

[formula]

with normalization [formula] for free-particle momentum state and ū(p,s)u(p,s)  =  2m for Dirac spinor with mass m. In addition to the background mechanism of Pomeron-exchange, t-channel π- and η-exchange, we will postulate the existence of a resonance by fiat and see whether we could describe the data of LEPS [\cite=leps05] [\cite=Chang10]. We can then write the full amplitude M as

[formula]

as shown in Fig. [\ref=gammapdiagram], where MN* contains both s- and u-channel contributions. The unpolarized differential cross section is related to the invariant amplitude by

[formula]

with [formula] is the photon three momentum in the center-of-mass (CM) frame and λN, λN', λγ and λφ denote the helicities of the initial proton, final proton, incoming photon, and outgoing φ-meson, respectively.

Pomeron exchange

Following Refs. [\cite=titov03] [\cite=titov07], we can easily write down the Pomeron-exchange amplitude of Fig. [\ref=gammapdiagram](d) ,

[formula]

where εμ(q,λφ) and εν(k,λγ) are the polarization vectors of the φ-meson and photon with λφ and λγ, respectively, and u(pi,λN) is the Dirac spinor of the nucleon with momentum pi(pf) and helicity λN(λN'). The transition operator Γμν in Eq. ([\ref=ampa]) is

[formula]

The scalar function M(s,t) is described by the Reggeon parametrization,

[formula]

where the Pomeron trajectory is taken to be αP(t)  =  1.08  +  0.25t and s0 = (mN + mφ)2. F1(t), the isoscalar form factor of the nucleon and F2(t), the form factor of the φ-photon-Pomeron coupling are given as [\cite=titov03] [\cite=donnachie87],

[formula]

with μ20  =  1.1 2, a2N  =  2.8, and t0  =  0.7 2.

In this study, we follow Ref. [\cite=titov03] by choosing the strength factor CP  =  3.65, which is obtained by fitting to the total cross sections data at high energy, as shown in the upper figure in Fig. [\ref=pomeron_comparison], where the inset show the enlarged view of the region for Eγ  ≤   7 GeV. We include a threshold factor sth as was done in Refs. [\cite=williams98] [\cite=titov03] in order to get a better agreement with experimental data near the threshold region. If sth = 0 is chosen as done in Ref. [\cite=titov03], a problem arises. Namely, the results for forward differential cross sections would overestimate the experimental data [\cite=durham] by about 20% as seen in the lower figure of Fig. [\ref=pomeron_comparison] around Eγ  =  6 GeV. Since pomeron properties and behaviors at lower energies are not well-established, we adjust this parameter to fit the experimental data on the differential cross sections around Eγ  =  6 GeV. Eγ  =  6 GeV is chosen because at this energy, one can reasonably expect that all other contributions from hadronic intermediate states would become negligible and only pomeron contributes. Furthermore, around this energy, experimental data are quite reliable in that they have relatively small error bars and rise steadily without much fluctuation. These give us confidence to match the pomeron contribution to the experimental data at this energy by fixing sth  =  1.3 2.

π and η-meson exchanges

The amplitudes for the π and η exchanges in t channel, Fig. [\ref=gammapdiagram](c) in a straightforward manner [\cite=titov97] [\cite=titov98] and are given by

[formula]

with the coupling constants gπNN, gγφπ, and gγφη, as well as the form factors Fπ(t) and Fη(t) for the virtually exchanged mesons at the MNN and γφM (M = π,η) vertices, respectively, are taken to be the same as in Ref. [\cite=titov07]. We choose gηNN  =  1.12 [\cite=wentai] and Λπ  =  Λη  =  1.2 GeV which are slightly different with the values given in Ref. [\cite=titov07]. The choice of the cut-off parameter Λπ = 1.2 GeV would lead to a Fπ(t) which agrees well with the πNN form factors as obtained in the meson-exchange πN model Ref. [\cite=piN] in the region of - 0.5  <  t  <  02 where most of the data considered in this present work lie.

Excitation of a baryon resonance

The Feynman diagrams with an N* in the intermediate state in s- and u-channel are shown in Fig. [\ref=gammapdiagram](a) and (b). To evaluate the invariant amplitudes involving N*, we use the following interaction Lagrangians. For the coupling of spin-1 / 2 and 3 / 2 resonances to γN, we choose the commonly used interaction Lagrangians [\cite=wentai] [\cite=feu] [\cite=pascalutsa]

[formula]

where Fμν  =  ∂μAν  -  ∂νAμ is the electromagnetic field tensor, and [formula]. Also, [formula] denotes the dual electromagnetic field tensor with ε0123  =   + 1. The operator Γ± are given by Γ+ = 1 and Γ-  =  γ5. For the φNN* interaction Lagrangians, we have

[formula]

where Gμν is defined as Gμν  =  ∂μφν  -  ∂νφμ with φμ the field of φ-meson. The dual field tensor μν is again defined in the same way as its electromagnetic counterpart with Fαβ  →  Gαβ. Notice that we could have chosen to describe the γNN* in the same way as we describe the φNN* interactions. However, current conservation consideration fixes g(1)γNN* for JP  =  1 / 2± resonances to be zero. In addition, the term proportional to g(3)γNN* in the Lagrangian densities of Eq. ([\ref=phiNNstar]) vanishes in the case of real photon. With the Lagrangians given in Eqs. ([\ref=photononehalf]-[\ref=phiNNstar]), the full invariant amplitude of s and u channels can readily be written down straightforwardly by following the Feynman rules.

The form factor for the vertices used in the s- and u-channel diagrams, FN*(p2), is taken to be similar as in Ref. [\cite=piN]

[formula]

with Λ is the cut-off parameter for the virtual N*. In this work, we choose Λ  =  1.2 GeV for all resonances. The spin-1 / 2 N* propagator can be written in a Breit-Wigner form as

[formula]

with ΓN* the total decay width of N*. The Rarita-Schwinger propagator is used for the spin-3 / 2 N*

[formula]

Because u < 0, we take ΓN*  =  0 MeV for the propagator in the u channel.

It should, however, be stressed that, we do not know the value of the coupling constants gφNN* and gγNN*, as our calculations are done in the tree level. Therefore, in present calculation, we show the values of gγNN*gφNN* obtained by fitting the experimental data.

Results and Discussions

With the model presented in Sec. [\ref=sec:formalism], one can easily obtain the full amplitude of γp  →  φp reaction and calculate the scattering observables straightforwardly with a specific assignment of spin-parity of the resonance. Since the peak appears to lie close to the φN threshold, only the lower partial waves are important and we shall consider only JP  =  1 / 2±,3 / 2± as the possible candidates for the spin-parity assignment of the resonance. In this work, we fit our model simultaneously to differential cross section at forward angle as a function of photon energy and differential cross sections dependence on t at eight photon energies reported in Ref. [\cite=leps05], as well as to nine spin-density matrix elements ραij [\cite=schillingnpb15397] as a a function of t at three photon energies [\cite=Chang10]. We use the Gottfried-Jackson system, in which φ-meson is at rest, as depicted in Fig. [\ref=GJ_frame], to analyze the spin-density matrix elements. The zGJ axis is taken to be along the incoming photon momentum while yGJ axis is taken to be along f  ×  i direction, with f and i the three-momentum of final and initial proton, respectively. The xGJ axis is chosen to form a right-handed coordinate system.

Notice that in our previous work [\cite=Kiswandhi10], decay angular distributions W, instead of the spin-density matrix elements ραij were used in the data set to which we fit our model parameters. Even though the decay angular distributions are also functions of spin-density matrix elements (SDME), they depend only on only six out of a total of nine SDMEs. Furthermore, the decay angular distributions used in Ref. [\cite=Kiswandhi10], as presented in Ref. [\cite=leps05], are taken only at two photon energies and averaged over t, while the nine SDMEs used in this work as presented in Ref. [\cite=Chang10] are taken at three photon energies and are functions of t. We expect that the larger set of data considered in this work would provide a more stringent constraint on our model and results.

In tree-level approximation, only products like gγNN*gφNN* enter. The other parameters in our model are the resonance mass and width. They are determined with the use of MINUIT by fitting to the data measured at SPring8 [\cite=leps05] [\cite=Chang10] as described in the previous paragraphs.

We find that, with assignments of spin-parity JP  =  1 / 2± for the resonance, the nonmonotonic behavior in the forward differential cross-section near threshold can be explained only with considerably stronger resonance contributions. As a result, the differential cross section as a function of t, as well as spin-density matrix elements, would be in disagreement with the experimental data [\cite=leps05] [\cite=Chang10]. The resulting χ2 / N from such fit will be around 5  ~  9, which is definitely far above those obtained by fitting using JP  =  3 / 2± resonances, as seen in Table [\ref=tab:nstar]. Therefore, we conclude that spin-1/2 resonance cannot fit the experimental data. It is worthwhile to note that in the constituent quark model of Refs. [\cite=capstick1] [\cite=capstick2], spin-1/2 resonances are also not predicted to be of significant contribution at around Eγ  =  2 GeV. Our results seem to be in line with their prediction.

On the other hand, we find that the experimental data can be well described with a spin-parity assignment of either JP  =  3 / 2- or JP  =  3 / 2+ for the postulated resonance. In the following, we first present our model predictions for the differential cross sections, spin-density matrix elements, and decay angular distributions and compare them with the data for both the cases with 3 / 2- and 3 / 2+ resonances. We then present an analysis on the composition of the bump structure. After that, we proceed by predicting the effect on ωN channel and estimating the strangeness content of the resonance. Lastly, we present also some predictions on the polarization observables.

Differential cross sections, spin-density matrix elements, and decay angular distributions

The quality of the agreement between data and model predictions for both spin-parity assignments, i.e., 3 / 2±, is similar even though the resulting χ2 value is slightly smaller for the case JP  =  3 / 2- as seen in Table [\ref=tab:nstar] where the values of the products of gγNN*gφNN* are also presented. The obtained values for the mass and width for 3 / 2- and 3 / 2+ resonances are very close, i.e., (mass, width) of (2.08, 0.570) and (2.08, 0.501) GeV, respectively, however, the products of the coupling constants are quite different.

The results of our best fit, as compared to the data of Refs. [\cite=leps05] [\cite=Chang10], are shown in Fig. [\ref=DCS_s]-  [\ref=GJ_227]. The dotted lines represent the contributions of the background of pomeron plus (π,η) exchanges and the solid and dashed curves correspond to the full model predictions including a resonance of 3 / 2- and 3 / 2+, respectively. In Figs. [\ref=DCS_s] and [\ref=DCS_t], the forward differential cross section as function of energy, where a bump is observed, and the differential cross section as function of t are shown, respectively. The contribution of the resonance alone is also shown therein with dash-dotted and dash-dot-dotted lines corresponding to 3 / 2- and 3 / 2+, respectively. We see that besides producing a bump in the forward differential cross section, the resonance reduces the discrepancy between predictions of the background mechanisms and the data substantially in the t dependence of the differential cross sections.

In Figs. [\ref=GJ_187]-[\ref=GJ_227], our model predictions for the SDME's in the three energy regions of 1.77  <  Eγ  <  1.97 GeV, 1.97  <  Eγ  <  2.17 GeV, and 2.17  <  Eγ  <  2.37 GeV are shown together with the data of Ref. [\cite=Chang10]. It is seen that in some cases, e.g., ρ010, ρ110, ρ210 in 1.97  <  Eγ  <  2.17 GeV, the nonresonant contribution alone already describes well the data and the resonance contributions are small. However, there are several cases that a 3 / 2+ resonance is indeed quite helpful to bridge the difference between background contribution and the data, especially for ρ000 in all energy regions, though its corrections are in the wrong direction for ρ11, - 1 and ρ21, - 1 in the region of 1.77  <  Eγ  <  1.97 GeV. The effect of a 3 / 2- resonance is in general less conspicuous than that of a 3 / 2+ resonance.

The decay angular distributions W( cos Θ), W(Φ  -  Ψ), W(Φ), W(Φ  +  Ψ), and W(Ψ) in Gottfried-Jackson frame depend on six SDMEs via the following relations,

[formula]

[formula]

where the angles Θ, Φ, and Ψ are illustrated in Fig. [\ref=GJ_frame]. Here, they are measured at two different energy bins 1.97  <  Eγ  <  2.17 GeV and 2.17  <  Eγ  <  2.37 GeV within the range of [formula] ([formula]). In our work, they are calculated at the midpoint of each energy bin Eγ by weighing them with the differential cross section as a function of t

[formula]

It is important to note that it is misleading to conclude that the effect of the resonance, be it 3 / 2+ or 3 / 2-, is insignificant in most cases. Fig. [\ref=GJ_207_min] shows the detail of the composition of the spin-density matrix elements as a function of t at 1.97 < Eγ < 2.17 GeV for a JP  =  3 / 2- where the full, dotted, dashed, and dash-dotted lines are the total, nonresonant, resonant, and interference between nonresonant and resonant contributions, respectively. It is obvious that the resonant contributions are not negligible compared to the nonresonant ones. However, the interference contributions are also roughly of the same strength as those of the resonance, and in many cases, of the opposite signs. This would cause the total contributions to come mainly from the nonresonant contributions only. However, it should be emphasized again, that the resonant contributions are not negligible.

Based on the similarities in their masses and spin-parities, one might wonder whether the 3 / 2- resonance found here can be identified as the D13(2080) as listed in PDG [\cite=PDG10]. The coupling constants given Table [\ref=tab:nstar] can be used to calculate the ratio of the helicity amplitudes A1 / 2 and A3 / 2. However, we cannot determine their magnitudes since we have only the products of the coupling constants γNN* and φNN*. We obtain a value of A1 / 2 / A3 / 2 = 1.05, while it is - 1.18 for D13(2080). Although their magnitudes are quite similar, they differ by a sign and we conclude that the resonance postulated here, if exists, cannot be identified with D13(2080).

Analysis on the composition of the bump structure

Our results for the forward differential cross sections of the JP  =  3 / 2± in Fig. [\ref=DCS_s] indicate constructive and destructive interferences of nonresonant and resonant amplitudes below and above the peak, respectively. Since the nonresonant amplitude is dominated overwhelmingly by Pomeron amplitude, which is almost completely imaginary, it seems to imply that the sign-changing component of the resonant part must then be also imaginary. However, it is well-known that the imaginary part of the resonant amplitude is sign definite while the sign-changing component of a resonant amplitude is real .

In order to understand this, let us decompose the forward differential cross section ([formula]) into its nonresonant, resonant, and interference terms

[formula]

in which T, [formula], and TR are the total, nonresonant, and resonant amplitudes, respectively. We also have

[formula]

where TP and TM are the Pomeron and meson-exchange amplitude, respectively. The interference term between the resonant and nonresonant amplitude [formula] can be further decomposed into a sum of interference terms between the resonant and pomeron amplitudes [formula], and the resonant and meson-exchange amplitudes [formula], respectively. This decomposition is shown in the Fig. [\ref=check], where the dot-dashed and dot-dot-dashed lines represent [formula] and [formula], respectively, with dashed lines denoting their sum [formula]. It is seen that for both JP  =  3 / 2± resonances, [formula] is always positive, while [formula] turns negative at around Eγ  =  1.82 GeV and becomes comparable in size to [formula] such that the sum [formula] eventually changes sign. We conclude that the meson-exchange mechanisms are indeed crucial in producing the peaking behavior observed in φ-photoproduction reaction.

Effects of the postulated resonance in the ωN channel

We further study the possible effect of this postulated resonance in the ωN channel. The conventional "minimal" parametrization relating φNN* and ωNN* is

[formula]

with [formula] corresponding to the deviation from the ideal φ  -  ω mixing angle. Here, [formula] is called the OZI-evading parameter and the larger value of [formula] would indicate larger strangeness content of the resonance.

For the present purpose, we choose the ω photoproduction model of Ref. [\cite=oh02] which includes the nucleon resonances predicted by Refs. [\cite=capstick1] [\cite=capstick2]. In Fig. [\ref=omega], one sees that the prediction of this model for the t-dependence of differential cross section at W  =  2.105 GeV, given in dotted line, exhibits substantial discrepancy with the most recent experimental data [\cite=M_Williams] for |t|  >  0.75 GeV2. With the addition of resonance postulated here with [formula] for JP  =  3 / 2-(JP  =  3 / 2+), we see that the differential cross section at W  =  2.105 and 2.305 GeV, as denoted by the solid black (dashed red) line in Fig. [\ref=omega], can be reproduced with roughly the correct strength. At the other energies, the improvement is much less noticeable because they are far from the energy of the resonance. The large values of [formula] would imply that the resonances we propose here might contain considerable amount of strangeness contents, an issue we now turn to in the next subsection.

Strangeness content of the postulated resonance

The resonance proposed here appears to have a large OZI evasion parameter [formula] which would lead one to ask whether this is reasonable. In this section, we will estimate the strangeness content of the resonance. We can write, for the wavefunction of the resonance [\cite=Ellis88],

[formula]

where x is real but zu, zd, and zs are all complex and |x|2  +  |zu|2  +  |zd|2  +  |zs|2  =  1. Let us define

[formula]

where M(N*  →  VidN) is the amplitude of the decay of N* to VidN where the subscript "id" denotes that the vector meson V is in its ideal state. For example, φid consists of pure ss̄ with no uū of d mixture.

We can obtain Zid experimentally from

[formula]

where

[formula]

is defined for the physical particles φ and ω. Here, [formula] can be estimated from [formula]. Notice that Zid  =  0 when [formula] which corresponds to the case of ordinary OZI violation arising from an ωφ mixing without the presence of strangeness content in the resonance N*. By using the values of [formula] for the resonance found in this work, the values for their [formula] can also be calculated from Eq. ([\ref=coupligrelation]). Therefore, employing Eq. ([\ref=Z_relation]) above, we can obtain the values of Zid, which are found to be - 0.68 and - 0.50 for JP  =  3 / 2- and JP  =  3 / 2+ resonances, respectively.

Within the constituent quark model, Zid is related to the amplitudes M3 and M5 corresponding to the processes depicted in Fig. [\ref=M3M5](a) and (b), respectively, as followings

[formula]

Let us now write [formula], where q  =  u,d,s, which separates the phase factor δq = eiθq of phase θq and the magnitude aq = |zq| of the amplitude. We further introduce [formula] and [formula]. After substituting, we have

[formula]

which leads to the probability of the strangeness content

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is seen that the strangeness probability Ps depends on M3,5 and zq's in a complicated way. The problem here is to make an educated estimate of it. Here, we first follow Ref. [\cite=brodsky] to assume that Pu,d / Ps  =  (ms / mu,d)2. It leads to cu  =  cd  =  ms / mu,d where ms and mu,d will be taken as 0.5 and 0.3 GeV, respectively To proceed, we further assume the ratio |F| between the reaction amplitudes M3 and M5 to lie within the range of 0.01 and 100, i.e., |M3|  =  (0.01  ~  100)|M5| and find the possible range of Ps. For a fixed value of |F|, we randomly vary the phase factors δq's to give Ps. The results, within 95% probability, are given by the shaded area in Fig. [\ref=strange] while the median values are denoted by the solid lines.

Notice that, for a fixed value of |F|, the lower bound of Ps is given by [formula], that is, when all the phases are such that the second term in N of Eq. ([\ref=N]), interferes constructively with the first. The lower bound of Ps goes to zero like [formula] as |F| approaches zero and approaches 1 / (1  +  c2u  +  c2d) = 0.153 when |F| grows larger. When [formula], the upper bound of Ps = 1 / (1  +  c2u  +  c2d) = 0.153 is reached. Note that with the values of Zid of the resonance given above, the condition [formula] can indeed be met with some combinations of the phase factors δq's. We point out that Ps = 1 / (1  +  c2u  +  c2d) = 0.153, would correspond to a resonance with 100% five-quark content, namely, a pentaquark state.

A rather broad range of Ps also reflects the situation faced in the efforts to determine the strangeness content in the proton, which is stable and can be more directly studied. Recent studies give estimates ranging from 0.025  -  0.058% [\cite=Kiswandhi11] to 2.4  -  2.9% [\cite=Chang].

Polarization observables

Since the fitted results with both assignments 3 / 2± for the resonance are rather similar, we need to find some observables that can help us to distinguish them. Here, we show some predictions for the polarization observables at photon laboratory energy Eγ  =  2.0 GeV near the resonance position. Three single polarization observables: asymmetries of the polarized beam Σx, polarized target Ty, and recoil polarization Py' are given in Fig. [\ref=Polarization] while four double polarization observables: beam-target (BT) asymmetries CBTyx, CBTyz, CBTzx, and CBTzz, with the photon beam and the nucleon target polarized, are given in Fig. [\ref=BT], where the dotted, solid, and dashed lines correspond to the contributions from background only, and with the addition of the postulated resonance of JP = 3 / 2- and JP = 3 / 2+, respectively. The notation of the polarization observables follows Ref. [\cite=titov98].

It can be concluded from Figs. [\ref=Polarization] and [\ref=BT] that while all the observables presented are reasonably distinct enough to distinguish the parities of the J  =  3 / 2 resonances, the single polarization observable Σx is actually the most distinct based on the opposite sign of the curves produced by the two parities.

summary and conclusions

In summary, we present the details and more extensive results of the analysis of the near-threshold bump structure in the forward differential cross section of the φ-meson photoproduction to determine whether it is a signature of a resonance. The analysis is carried out with an effective Lagrangian approach which includes Pomeron and (π,η) exchanges in the t channel and contributions from the s- and u-channel excitation of a postulated resonance.

Besides the differential cross sections at forward angle as function of photon energy and as function of t, the recent data on nine spin-density matrix elements at three photon energies reported by the LEPS collaboration are used, instead of the decay angular distributions of the φ meson, which depend only on six spin-density matrix elements, as was done before in Ref. [\cite=Kiswandhi10], to constrain the model. Moreover, the new spin-density matrix element data are given as a function of t, while the previous decay angular distribution data are not. Therefore, the new set of data are expected to give more strict constraints on the resulting resonance parameters.

We conclude that indeed the nonmonotonic behavior, along with the other experimental data, as reported by LEPS, can only be explained with an assumption of the excitation of a resonance of spin 3/2, as previously reported. However, both parities of (  ±  ) can account for the data equally well with almost identical mass of 2.08  ±  0.04 GeV and width of 0.501  ±  0.117 and 0.570  ±  0.159 for 3 / 2- and 3 / 2+, respectively. Spin-1/2 resonances can still explain the nonmonotonic behavior, but however would lead to large resonance contributions, which would cause differential cross sections as functions of t, as well as the spin-density matrix elements to disagree with experimental data.

The helicity amplitudes of the JP  =  3 / 2- resonance calculated from the obtained coupling constants gives a ratio of A1 / 2 / A3 / 2  =  1.05 which differs in sign from the value of - 1.18 of D13(2080) given by the PDG. Therefore, we conclude that the JP  =  3 / 2- resonance cannot be identified as D13(2080). The ratio of helicity amplitudes of the JP  =  3 / 2+ resonance is obtained to be of A1 / 2 / A3 / 2 = 0.89.

Some of the single and double polarization observables which are sensitive to the parity of the resonance, including beam asymmetry Σx, target asymmetry Tx, recoil asymmetry Px, and beam-target asymmetry CBTij, near the resonance peak are also given. Measurement of these quantities would be most helpful in further substantiating whether the nonmonotonic behavior is indeed a signature of resonance as well as resolving its parity. We find that the single polarization observable of beam asymmetry Σx provides an excellent way to resolve the parity of the resonance since they are of opposite signs with different parity.

We have also investigated the effects of the postulated resonances to the differential cross section of ω photoproduction as a function of t within the model of Ref. [\cite=oh02]. We find that the proposed resonance improves the agreement with the data, especially around the photon LAB energy of 2.1 GeV, if large values of OZI-evading parameter [formula] and [formula] for JP  =  3 / 2- and JP  =  3 / 2+ resonances, respectively, are assumed. Here, again, both resonances are equally capable of improving the discrepancy between the data and the predictions of Ref. [\cite=oh02]. It adds support for the resonance we postulate. We argue that the large values of OZI-evading parameter [formula] found imply that the postulated resonance might contain a strangeness content of Ps  =  0.1  ~  15%. If the postulated resonance contains considerable amount of strangeness, then it could couple strongly to, say, KΛ channel. Question would then arise on how the coupled-channel effects would modify the low-energy behavior of the nonresonant amplitude employed in this investigation. This can be answered only with a full coupled-channel calculations.
