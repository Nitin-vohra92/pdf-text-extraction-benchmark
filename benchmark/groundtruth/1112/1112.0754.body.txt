A characterization of incomplete sequences in vector spaces

Introduction

Let G be an additive group and A be a sequence of elements of G. We denote by SA the collection of subsequence sums of A:

[formula]

For a positive integer m  ≤  |A|, we denote by m*A the collection of partial sums over subsequences of cardinality m,

[formula]

If [formula] (or [formula] then we say that A is zero-sum-free (or m-zero-sum-free). If SA  ≠  G (or [formula] then we say that A is incomplete (or m-incomplete).

The following questions are among the most popular in classical combinatorial number theory.

When is A zero-sum-free? When is A incomplete? When is A m - zero-sum-free? When is A m-incomplete?

There is a number of results concerning these questions (see for instance [\cite=GG] [\cite=Ge] [\cite=Sarbook] [\cite=Sun] [\cite=Vu] for surveys) including classical results such as Olson's theorem and the Erds-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem. Our goal is to study the above problems for the basic group [formula], as d is fixed and p is a large prime. (Here and later [formula] denote the finite field with p elements.)

Our understanding in the case d = 1 is more or less satisfying, due to the results from [\cite=NgSzV] [\cite=NgV] (see also [\cite=Vu] for a survey). However, the proofs of these results do not extend to higher dimensions. The main difficulty in the extension is the existence of non-trivial subgroups (subspaces). In this paper, we develop a new approach that leads to a characterization for incomplete sequences in [formula] for d  ≥  2. This approach makes important use of ideas developed by Alon and Dubiner in [\cite=AD].

In what follows, it is important to distinguish sequence (which means multiple set, where an element may have multiplicity greater than one) and set or subset (each element appears exactly once).

Let us start by a simple observation. As [formula], if A is incomplete then it is also m-incomplete for every m  ≤  |A|. So, we are going to consider m-incomplete sequences. It is clear that if A belongs to a translate of a proper subspace of [formula], then [formula] belongs to another translate of that proper subspace, and hence A is m-incomplete.

Our leading intuition is that some sort of converse statement must hold. Roughly speaking, we expect that the main reason for a sequence A in [formula] to be m-incomplete is that its elements are contained in few translates of a proper subspace. In the special case d = 1, the only proper subspace is {0}. Thus if A is a m-incomplete sequence in [formula], then it consists of few elements of high multiplicities (see [\cite=NgV] for detailed discussion). We are able to quantify this intuition in the following form.

For any positive integer d and positive constants α,β there is a positive constant ε such that the following holds for every sequence A in [formula], where p is a sufficiently large prime. Either there is an m  ≤  βp such that [formula] or A can be partitioned into disjoint subsequences [formula] such that

|A0|  ≤  αp;

|Ai|  =  ⌊εp⌋,i  ≥  1;

there is a subspace H such that each Ai (1  ≤  i  ≤  l) is contained in a translate of H and [formula] contains a translate of H for some 1  ≤  m  ≤  |A0|.

The set A0 is often viewed as the set of exceptional elements. Note that if H = {0}, then each Ai consists of only one element of multiplicity ⌊εp⌋.

Theorem [\ref=theorem:characterization1] seem to be applicable for various additive problems in vector spaces. In the rest of this section, we discuss a few examples.

Olson's constant. Given an additive group G, let OL(G), the Olson constant of G, be the smallest integer such that no subset of G of cardinality OL(G) is zero-sum-free. OL(G) is a parameter of principal interest and its determination has a long history. Erds, Graham and Heilbronn ([\cite=EG]) conjectured that [formula]. Szemerédi ([\cite=Sz]) showed that there exists an absolute constant c such that [formula]. Olson ([\cite=O1],[\cite=O2]) then improved it to [formula]. The current record is due to Hamidoune and Zémor ([\cite=HZ]) who showed that [formula].

Regarding the group [formula], Hamidoune and Zémor proved that [formula]. They conjectured that the additional log  term is not necessary, and this has been recently settled by the current authors with Szemerédi (also due to Deshouillers and Prakash, see [\cite=NgSzV]). These results give the exact value of [formula]. Recently, Gao, Ruzsa and Thangadurai [\cite=GRT] showed that [formula].

Our first application is the following strengthening of Gao-Ruzsa-Thangadurai result.

Suppose that A is a zero-sum-free set of cardinality [formula] in [formula], where p is a sufficiently large prime. Then there is a linear full rank map Φ such that one of the following holds.

Φ(A) contains [formula] points on the line x = 0 and p - 1 points on the line x = 1.

Φ(A) contains [formula] points on the line x = 0, p - 2 points on the line x = 1, and one point on the line x = 2.

Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson2] not only reproves the bound [formula], but also characterizes all extremal sets. The proof is short and simple; furthermore, it also classifies zero-sum-free sets of size ≥  εp, for any constant ε > 0, but we do not elaborate on this point.

It is not hard to see that there exists in [formula] a zero-sum-free set of size [formula]. (One can see this by taking the union of a zero-sum-free set of size [formula] on the hyperplane xd = 0 and p - 1 arbitrary points of the plane xd = 1.) We thus have [formula]. Gao, Ruzsa and Thangadurai [\cite=GRT] made the following conjecture.

For any fixed d and sufficiently large p, [formula].

The assumption that p is sufficiently large is necessary, see [\cite=GG].

Since [formula], this conjecture would imply the following asymptotic version.

For any fixed d  ≥  2 and γ > 0, the following holds for all sufficiently large p: [formula] (Notice that the lower bound [formula] is obvious.)

As far as we know (prior to this paper) there has been no progress on either conjecture. As another application of Theorem [\ref=theorem:characterization1] we settle the d = 3 case of Conjecture [\ref=conj2].

Let γ > 0 be an arbitrary positive constant, then the following holds for sufficiently large prime p,

[formula]

It is possible that one can establish Conjecture [\ref=conj2] for arbitrary d using this approach, but the technical details still elude us at this point.

In the rest of this section we introduce our notation. The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section [\ref=section:lemmas] we provide our main lemmas. The proof of the characterization result is presented in Section [\ref=section:characterization1]. The last two sections are devoted to the proofs of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson2] and Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson3], respectively.

Notation

Norm in [formula]. For [formula], [formula] (the norm of x) is the circular distance from x to 0. (For example, the norm of p - 1 is 1.)

Dilation of a sequence. For [formula] and a sequence [formula], b  ·  A is the collection of all ba, where a varies in A.

Projections. Let H and H' be (not necessarily orthogonal) complementary subspaces. For a vector [formula] we let πH(a),πH'(a) be the unique vectors aH,aH' satisfying a = aH + aH' and aH∈H,aH'∈H' respectively. (Whenever we use this notation, both H and H' will be specified.) For a given sequence A, set πH(A): = {πH(a)|a∈A}.

Affine basis. A collection of d + 1 vectors in general position forms an affine basis of [formula].

Technical Lemmas

We are going to use the following results from [\cite=AD].

Assume that s  ≤  p. Let [formula] be s affine bases of [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let W be a number at least one and A be a sequence in [formula] such that no hyperplane contains more than |A| / (4W) elements of A. Then for every subset Y of [formula] of size at most pd / 2, there is an element a of A such that

[formula]

One can immediately derive the following corollary

Let W be a number at least one and A be a sequence in [formula] such that no hyperplane contains more than |A| / (4W) elements of A. Then for every subset Y of [formula] of size at most pd / 2 and any element a'∈A there is another element a∈A such that

[formula]

(of Corollary [\ref=cor:AD2]) Apply Lemma [\ref=lemma:AD2] for the sequence A': = {x - a'|x∈A} and Y. If there is a hyperplane H containing |A'| / (4W)  =  |A| / (4W) elements of A', then the hyperplane H': = a' + H contains |A| / (4W) elements of A. If there is no such H, then there is an element a - a' in A' such that

[formula]

Notice that [formula] if and only if [formula]. The claim follows.

Our proof for the characterization theorem is based on induction on d. We will invoke the following result from our earlier paper [\cite=NgV] as a black box.

Assume that A is an incomplete sequence in [formula], with sufficiently large p. Then there is a residue b  ≠  0 such that we can partition b  ·  A into two disjoint subsequences [formula] where

[formula]

[formula]

We close this section with a trivial, but useful, fact.

Let H1,H1' be subspaces such that [formula]. Let A1,A2 be such sequences in [formula] that [formula] contains a translate of a subspace H1 of [formula] and [formula] contains a translate of a subspace H2 of H1'. Then [formula] contains a translate of the subspace H1 + H2 in [formula].

(of Fact [\ref=fact:dimensionincrement]) Since [formula] contains a translate of H1, there exists a vector [formula] such that [formula].

Since [formula] contains a translate of H2, there exists a vector [formula] such that for any h2∈H2 there corresponds a vector h1∈H1 satisfying [formula]. Hence [formula].

Since the above holds for all h2∈H2, we have [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:characterization1]

Existence of rich hyperplanes

For any positive integer d and positive constants β,δ there is a positive constant ε such that the following holds. Let A be a sequence in [formula] with at least δp elements so that there is no 1  ≤  m  ≤  βp such that [formula]. Then, there is a hyperplane H such that

[formula]

(of Lemma [\ref=lemma:AD3]) Let c1  ≤   min {β / 4(d + 1),δ / 4(d + 1)} be a small positive constant. We consider two cases.

Case 1. One cannot find 2c1p disjoint affine bases in A.

In this case, by the definition of affine basis, there is a hyperplane H containing

[formula]

elements of A and we are done.

Case 2. One can find 2c1p disjoint affine bases in A.

Set s: = c1p and let [formula] be the bases. Define

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:AD1],

[formula]

Partition [formula] into two sequences E†,F† of equal sizes (we can throw one element from A to ensure parity). By choosing c1 sufficiently small, we can assume that |E†|  =  |F†|  ≥  |A| / 4.

Let W = W(d,δ,β) be a large constant and ε be a small constant to be determined. Assume, for a contradiction that there is no hyperplane containing ε|A| elements of A.

Let a0' be an arbitrary element of E†. By the way we set ε so that

[formula]

Thus there is no hyperplane containing |E†| / (8W) elements of E†. By Corollary [\ref=cor:AD2], we find [formula] such that

[formula]

Define [formula] and [formula]. Repeating the argument, we find elements a1',a1∈E†1 such that

[formula]

In general, set [formula] and [formula]. By induction, we have

[formula]

unless |Ei - 1|  >  pd / 2. Thus by choosing W sufficiently large (in terms of d,δ and β), there is some 0  ≤  k  ≤   min {βp / 4,δp / 16} such that

[formula]

Notice that in every step, the condition ε|A|  ≤  |E†i| / (4W) is satisfied because of [\eqref=eqn:ep] and |E†i|  ≥  |E†| - 2k  ≥  |E†| - δp / 8.

Repeating the argument with F† and F0, we have for some 0  ≤  l  ≤   min {βp / 4,δp / 16} that

[formula]

Observe that if X and Y are two subsets of a finite Abelian group G and |X|,|Y|  >  |G| / 2, then X + Y = G. Thus,

[formula]

The left hand side is a subset of [formula] for some small m. Indeed, the elements in Ek (or Fl) are sums of exactly c1p + k (or c1p + l) elements of A. Furthermore, by the procedure, the sequence of elements of A involved in Ek is disjoint from the sequence of elements of A involved in Fl. Finally,

[formula]

This concludes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:AD3].

Completing the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:characterization1]

Let δ0 be a small positive constant. There is a positive constant ε0 such that (using Lemma [\ref=lemma:AD3] iteratively) we can partition [formula], where |B0|  ≤  δ0p and |Bi|  =  ⌊ε0p⌋ and each Bi (1  ≤  i  ≤  h) is contained in a hyperplane Di. Consider two cases:

Case 1. There are some 1  ≤  i  ≤  h and 1  ≤  m  ≤  βp / 2 such that [formula] contains v + Di, a translate of Di.

We can assume that i = 1 and that D1 is parallel to the subspace H spanned by the basic vectors [formula]. Let A' be the projection of [formula] into H' spanned by ed.

Consider A'. First, A' is a sequence in [formula] with |A|  -  ⌊ε0p⌋ elements. Second, if there is no 1  ≤  m  ≤  βp such that [formula], then there is no 1  ≤  m  ≤  βp / 2 such that [formula] by Fact [\ref=fact:dimensionincrement]. The classification theorem for [formula], Theorem [\ref=theorem:classification:d=1], implies that there is a subsequence A'' of A' with at most ε0p elements such that [formula] contains M = Oε0(1) different elements [formula]. Indeed, one can set A'' to consist of [formula] and those elements b- 1  ·  a, where [formula] and [formula].

Consider the system of parallel hyperplanes [formula]. Set ε: = α  /  2M. Partition [formula] into disjoint subsequences of size exactly ⌊εp⌋ and a remainder sequence of size less than εp. Let A0 be the union of the remainders and B0,B1 and A''. We have

[formula]

Furthermore, there is some 1  ≤  m  ≤  βp / 2 such that [formula] contains a hyperplane parallel to H. Finally, [formula] are partitioned into sequences of size exactly ⌊εp⌋, each of which is contained in a translate of H. This concludes the proof for the first case.

Case 2. There is no 1  ≤  i  ≤  h and 1  ≤  m  ≤  βp / 2 such that [formula] is a translate of Di.

In this case, we can apply the induction hypothesis to a translate of Bi (which is contained in the subspace parallel with Di) to obtain a decomposition [formula], where Bij,1  ≤  j  ≤  li are contained in translates of a subspace Hi and there is an integer mi such that [formula] contains a translate of Hi (we choose the parameters to be small enough such that |Bi0|  ≤   min (α / (2h),β / (2h))). Without loss of generality, one may assume that all Bij have the same size ⌊εp⌋ with a small positive constant ε.

Now take [formula] and let Ak ([formula]) be the Bij. By choosing δ0 small, we get |A0|  ≤  αp.

Note that [formula], and thus [formula], contains a translate of [formula]. Each Ak (1  ≤  k) is contained in a translate of H since it is contained in a translate of Hk.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson2]

The idea is to "project" the problem into [formula] by using the characterization theorem. Once inside this group, we will be able to invoke Theorem [\ref=theorem:classification:d=1]. In fact, we will also need the following result.

Let A be a non-empty subset of [formula]. Then [formula] In particular, provided that p is large enough, we have

if [formula], then [formula];

if |A|  ≥  .51p, then [formula] for all 2  ≤  m  ≤  |A| - 2.

For more general results on m - incomplete sequences in [formula], we refer the reader to [\cite=NgV].

Let B1,B2 be subsets of the lines x = b and x = p - b of [formula] respectively. Assume that |B1| + |B2| > p. Then B1 + B2 contains the whole y-axis. In particular, the set [formula] is not zero-sum-free in [formula].

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson2]. Let α and β be sufficiently small constants. Assume that A is zero-sum-free. By Theorem [\ref=theorem:characterization1], there exists A0  ⊂  A of cardinality |A0|  ≤  αp such that [formula] contains a line of [formula]. Without loss of generality, we assume that this line is parallel to the y-axis L:x = 0.

Let L' be the collection of points on the x-axis, then [formula]. Let [formula] be the projection of [formula] into L', thus B is a sequence in [formula]. Since A is zero-sum-free, we have

[formula] (see discussion prior to Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson2]),

B is an incomplete sequence in [formula] (by Fact [\ref=fact:dimensionincrement] and that [formula] contains a translate of L).

Together with Theorem [\ref=theorem:classification:d=1], the last observation implies that, after an appropriate dilation of A in the direction of the x-axis [formula], B contains at least (1 - 2α)p elements of norm 1 (those b∈B with [formula]). (Note that such a dilation does not affect the property of A0, i.e. [formula] still contains a vertical line.)

Let [formula] and [formula] be the collections of elements of A whose x-coordinate are - 1 and 1 respectively. As these elements correspond to the one of norm 1 in B, we have |A- 1| + |A1|  ≥  (1 - 2α)p.

Without loss of generality, assume that [formula]. It follows from the first part of Theorem [\ref=theorem:ErdosHeilbronn] that [formula] contains the whole line [formula], and hence [formula] by Fact [\ref=fact:addinglines]. In other words, [formula].

To make the presentation less technical, we abuse the notation to write [formula], where the new set A0 is the intersection of A with the y-axis, [formula], and [formula]

Now comes a crucial observation. Since |A1|  ≥  (1 - 3α)p, the second part of Theorem [\ref=theorem:ErdosHeilbronn] implies that l*A1 covers the whole vertical line x = l, for every 2  ≤  l  ≤  |A1| - 2. Thus the set [formula] covers the whole strip [formula].

The last conclusion immediately implies that |A- 1|  ≤  1, otherwise [formula] would contain L, and hence the origin, a contradiction.

We next focus on A'. Let [formula] be the projection of A' into the x-axis L'. It follows that there does not exist any subset of X whose sum belongs to the "opposite" of [formula], i.e. we must have [formula] (in [formula]).

This partly implies that [formula], but more importantly, viewing xi as real numbers, we must have

[formula]

Indeed, if there exists an i such that [formula] then [formula]. Thus, after taking modulo p, [formula] remains in [formula], which belongs to the "opposite" of [formula] in [formula], a contradiction.

Since xi  ≥  2, [\eqref=equation:Olson2:1] implies that |A'| is small, 2|A'|  ≤  p - |A1| + 1. From the definition of A', using |A- 1|  ≤  1, we have 2|A| - p - 3  ≤  2|A0| + |A1|. Inserting the bound of [formula], we obtain that [formula].

Note that [formula], the above result trivially implies that |A0| + |A1| > p, i.e. A0 + A1 covers the whole line x = 1. Hence A- 1 must be empty.

Using this new information (instead of |A- 1|  ≤  1) and the upper bounds [formula], we easily obtain the lower bounds |A1|  ≥  p - 3 and [formula], and hence [\eqref=equation:Olson2:1] implies that [formula]. Since xi  ≥  2, we must have |A'|  ≤  2. If |A'| = 0, we are done. It remains to consider the following two cases.

Case 1. |A'| = 2. We then have x1 = x2 = 2. Thus, if |A1| = p - 2 and [formula], then [formula] covers the whole y-axis x = 0, contradiction. Furthermore, if |A1| = p - 3 and [formula], then [formula] covers p - 3 elements of the y-axis, and hence [formula] covers the whole axis, another contradiction.

Case 2. |A'| = 1. We then easily eliminate the case |A1| = p - 1 and [formula] because in this case, by [\eqref=equation:Olson2:1], we must have x1 = 2, and hence [formula] covers the whole y-axis.

Assuming |A1| = p - 2 and [formula], it is implied that x1  ≤  3 by [\eqref=equation:Olson2:1]. But if x1 = 3 then [formula] covers p - 2 elements of the y-axis, and hence [formula] covers the whole axis, a contradiction. As a consequence, x1 = 2. The only reason that [formula] is zero-sum-free in this case is that the multiset [formula] is zero-sum-free in [formula], completing the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson3]

To establish Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson3], we again rely on our characterization theorem to project back to [formula]. After this step, we are not working with sets anymore, but rather with sequences. For this reason, we need the following statement about the "sequence" counterpart of Olson's constant (which is usually referred to as the Davenport's constant).

Any collection of d(p - 1) + 1 elements of [formula] is not zero-sum-free.

Now we present the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Olson3]. Assume that there exists a set A of size (2 + γ)p which is zero-sum-free. By Theorem [\ref=theorem:characterization1] (after a bijective linear mapping) we can partition A into disjoint sequences, [formula] where

|A0|  ≤  γp / 4;

|Ai| = ⌊εp⌋;

[formula] contains a translate of a subspace H, for some m  ≤  |A0|;

there exist n  ≤  n(γ) vectors [formula] such that Ai  ⊂  ai  +  H.

Let d' be the dimension of H. We observe that d' can not be either 0 or 3, since the first case would imply that A contains elements of multiplicity ⌊εp⌋ > 1 (as ε is independent of p), while the second would imply that A is complete. We consider two remaining cases.

Case 1. d' = 2. Without loss of generality, we assume that H = {z = 0}. Consider the projection B of [formula] onto the z-axis, which can be viewed as a sequence in [formula]. Since A is zero-sum-free, [formula]. Thus there are at least |A| - |A0| - (1 + γ / 4)p  ≥  (1 + γ / 2)p elements of B having non-zero norm.

By item 2 of Theorem [\ref=theorem:classification:d=1], the latter implies that B is complete in [formula] (in fact, it is easy to see that any sequence of p non-zero elements of [formula] is complete). Hence [formula], in particular the origin, a contradiction.

Case 2. d' = 1. Without loss of generality, we assume that H is the z-axis {x = 0,y = 0}. By the property of Ai, we may write Ai  ⊂  vi + H, where vi is the projection of ai onto the xy-plane {z = 0}.

Consider the sequence [formula], where each vi has multiplicity |Ai| - ⌊2 / ε⌋. Since [formula], Theorem [\ref=theorem:Davenportconstant] implies that there exist 0  ≤  mi  ≤  |Ai| - 2 / ε such that [formula] (in the xy-plane), where not all mi are zero. By multiplying all mi by ⌊2 / ε⌋ if needed, we may assume that at least one of the mi is greater than ⌊2 / ε⌋. Let this be m1.

We now consider the sumset [formula]. By the definition of mi and vi, the projection of this set into the xy-plane is the origin, in other words, [formula] belong to the z-axis.

On the other hand, since |A1| = ⌊εp⌋ and ⌊2 / ε⌋  ≤  m1  ≤  |A1| - 2 / ε, Theorem [\ref=theorem:ErdosHeilbronn] implies that [formula] contains a translate of H, i. e. , [formula] contains the whole line which has image m1v1 in the xy-plane.

It follows that [formula] covers the whole z-axis, and hence the origin, a contradiction.
