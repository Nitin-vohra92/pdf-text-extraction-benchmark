Tree-level unitarity constraints for the SM-like 2HDM

Introduction

Unitarity constraints for the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) have been extensively studied before [\cite=huffel] [\cite=weldon] [\cite=casa] [\cite=casal] [\cite=malampi] [\cite=kanemura] [\cite=akeroyd] [\cite=ivanov] [\cite=gi] [\cite=nowa], however the SM-like limit of the model has been considered only in the case with violation of [formula] symmetry [\cite=tsu]. Bounds on the scalar particles' masses following from the basic assumption of tree-level unitarity in different versions of 2HDM, including the Inert Model, have been considered recently by one of us [\cite=ja]. Here we present an extension of this analysis for the SM-like 2HDM. We assume that the mass of the lightest Higgs boson is in the range    in agreement with the newest results from the LHC for the SM Higgs boson presented in December 2011 [\cite=lhc].

The general and the SM-like Mixed Models

We consider a 2HDM with a general [formula]-symmetric potential for the SU(2) doublets φS, φD [\cite=kr]:

[formula]

The parameters m211, m222 and [formula] are real numbers and without loss of generality [\cite=kr] [\cite=cp] [\cite=sym] we can assume that λ5 is real. For a stable vacuum state to exist it is necessary that [\cite=ma]:

[formula]

where λ345  =  λ3  +  λ4  +  λ5.

We consider a model (called a Mixed Model) in which a Mixed vacuum is realized, i.e. in the state of the lowest energy (the global minimum of the potential) both of the doublets develop non-zero vacuum expectation values: [formula], [formula], vD  /  vS  =   tan β, β∈(0,  π / 2). The Mixed vacuum exists when the following conditions are satisfied [\cite=kr] [\cite=ja]

[formula]

The matrix of second derivatives of the potential is non-diagonal, so the mass eigenstates are mixtures of the fields appearing in the potential. There is one mixing angle β in the charged and the CP-odd sectors and one mixing angle α in the CP-even sector, α∈( - π / 2,  π / 2). There arise 3 Goldstone bosons and 5 physical Higgs particles: H±, A, H, h, with MH > Mh. Different models of Yukawa interactions can be chosen, however we do not fix a particular one here, because Yukawa interactions do not effect the following analysis.

When an additional condition:

[formula]

is imposed, h couples to gauge bosons at the tree-level like the SM Higgs particle [\cite=sm-like]. Then, it is justified to apply the following experimental bounds on its mass,

[formula]

found for the SM Higgs boson [\cite=lhc]. A Mixed Model with additional assumptions ([\ref=sm-like]) and ([\ref=Mhexp]) we call a SM-like Mixed Model. In the following we will focus on this model, however, for comparison results for the general Mixed Model are presented as well.

Tree-level unitarity approach

To derive constraints from unitarity we follow the standard high-energy approach, where longitudinally polarized states of vector bosons are replaced by the corresponding would-be Goldstone bosons [\cite=lqt] and only the quartic interactions are included in the [formula] scatterings. In this analysis we consider the scattering matrix for the original fields of the Lagrangian, i.e. not mass eigenstates, as this makes analysis simpler [\cite=kanemura].

Inequalities resulting from the unitarity condition on the s-wave

[formula]

are considered. They are inferred from the full tree-level high-energy scattering matrix of the scalar sector with 25 different channels [\cite=ja]. The inequalities are solved numerically (as in [\cite=akeroyd]) taking into account explicitly the positivity constraints ([\ref=pos]) and conditions necessary for the existence of Mixed vacuum ([\ref=mix]), as well as two additional constraints ([\ref=sm-like]) and ([\ref=Mhexp]) for the SM-like Mixed Model. For simplicity the set of the relevant conditions, namely: tree-level unitarity constraint ([\ref=unit]) together with constraints ([\ref=pos]) and ([\ref=mix]) (for the SM-like Model the set contains in addition two constraints ([\ref=sm-like]) and ([\ref=Mhexp])) will be called the unitarity constraints.

A scan, subject to the unitarity constraints, over different values of tan β and Higgs boson masses is performed in the following ranges:

[formula]

Results

We perform a scan for the general and the SM-like Mixed Models and as a result bounds on scalars' masses as well as on tan β are obtained.

General Mixed Model

Unitarity constraints lead to the following upper bounds on the Higgs bosons' masses in the general Mixed Model:

[formula]

Note that h is remarkably lighter than the other Higgs bosons and that tan β is not bounded by the unitarity constraints. These results agree at the level of 1-3% with the most precise analytical results obtained in Ref. [\cite=nowa].

SM-like Mixed Model

For the SM-like Mixed Model we perform an analysis analogous to the one for the general case discussed above. The following upper bounds are found:

[formula]

and

[formula]

We see that the bounds for H± and H are lowered by 70-80   in comparison to the general case (compare with Eq. ([\ref=eq:mixed-wynik])). What definitely draws attention is the stringent bound on tan β which arises in this case. In the next section we discuss main sources of this strong bound. The regions of masses allowed by the unitarity constraints and their correlations with tan β are presented in Fig. [\ref=masy] and Fig. [\ref=masytb] (pale area), respectively. The upper bounds, Eqs. ([\ref=eq:mixed-wynik]) and ([\ref=eq:bound]), should be treated as maximal values reached during the scan. It should be underlined that these values not always can be approached simultaneously, as it can be inferred from the Figs. [\ref=masy] and [\ref=masytb], where allowed regions in respective parameter spaces are presented.

The bounds presented above suffer from some uncertainties inherent to the numerical method in use. The uncertainties can be evaluated using Figs. 1 and 2. If the boundaries of the regions of allowed masses are smooth and well filled with points the uncertainties are small (should not exceed 1%), while if the boundaries consist of separated points, the uncertainties are obviously larger.

Discussion of the bound on tan β in the SM-like Mixed Model

The role of the experimental bound on Mh

The correlations between the masses and tan β allowed by the unitarity constraints in the SM-like Mixed Model are presented in Fig. [\ref=masytb] (pale area). For comparison analogous results obtained without condition ([\ref=Mhexp]) imposed are presented (Fig. [\ref=masytb], dark area).

The mass of h can be expressed in the Mixed Models as [\cite=kr]:

[formula]

Hence for fixed λ's we have

[formula]

Therefore tan β cannot be neither too small nor too large if the lower limit on Mh is applied. In general, an upper bound on tan β will arise whenever a lower bound on Mh is imposed.

In Fig. [\ref=masytb] (left panel, pale area) the allowed region for Mh and tan β is shown. It is clear that the upper and lower limits on tan β are correlated with lower limit Mh = 114  , the same holds for MH (Fig. [\ref=masytb], right panel, pale area).

These results are in agreement with the reasoning ([\ref=limtb1]) and confirm that the bounds on tan β, Eq. ([\ref=tb]), are due to the experimental lower bound on Mh mass ([\ref=Mhexp]).

The role of the condition sin (β  -  α) = 1

If we waive the constraint ([\ref=sm-like]) sin (β  -  α) = 1 but keep the experimental limits ([\ref=Mhexp]) on Mh, the bounds on tan β are found to be almost the same as in Eq. ([\ref=tb]), namely [formula]. Thus, the bounds on tan β are arise mainly due to the constrain on Mh and it is not necessary that h couples to gauge bosons and fermions like the SM Higgs to obtain them.

Discussion and summary

We considered the tree-level unitarity for the SM-like Mixed Model, and found very stringent bounds on tan β: [formula]. These bounds have been shown to be induced by the lower experimental limit (115 GeV) imposed on Mh. It is worth noticing that the limits on tan β are obtained without specifying the type of the Yukawa interactions and without applying constraints directly on couplings with gauge bosons (i.e. on sin (β  -  α)).
