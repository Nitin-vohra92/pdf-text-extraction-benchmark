On the spectrum of monoids and semilattices

Introduction

In the last years there was considerable interest in the spectrum of commutative monoids [\cite=kato],[\cite=b],[\cite=deitmar1],[\cite=deitmar2],[\cite=cc1],[\cite=cc2], [\cite=chu], [\cite=cort]. These objects play the same role in the theory of schemes over the 'field with one element' as the spectrum of rings played in the theory of schemes over rings. See also [\cite=lopez] for more about geometry over the field with one element.

The aim of this short note is to prove a useful lemma on the spectrum of commutative monoids and some of its immediate consequences. Our lemma claims that for any commutative monoid M one has a natural isomorphism

[formula]

where [formula] is taken in the category of commutative monoids and [formula]. The monoid structure in the spectrum of a monoid, is given by the union of prime ideals. From isomorphism ([\ref=sph]), one easily deduces the 'reduction isomorphism'

[formula]

where Msl is M modulo to the relation a2 = a. Thus the study of the spectrum of commutative monoids, reduces to the study of the spectrum of semilattices. Our second main result claims that if L is a semilattice, then there is an injective map

[formula]

which is bijective provided L is finitely generated (hence finite). In particular these results give an effective way of computing Spec(M) for an arbitrary finitely generated commutative monoid M. We also show that α is "natural" in the following sense. If f:L  →  L' is a morphism of finitely generated semilattices, then one has the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the right adjoint of f. The case of infinite semilatices is also considered.

Most of the results in this note were part of my 4th year masters thesis at UCL, under the supervision of Dr. Javier López Peña, who has introduced me to this subject. But Isomorphism (1), which is new, not only simplifies much, but also gives a new insight in the spectrum of monoids.

Prime ideals of commutative monoids

In what follows all monoids are commutative and they are written multiplicatively. Let M be a monoid, then a subset [formula] is called an ideal provided for any [formula] and x∈M one has [formula]. For an element a∈M, we let (a) be the principal ideal aM. An ideal [formula] is called prime, provided [formula] and the complement [formula] of [formula] in M is a submonoid. Thus an ideal [formula] is prime iff [formula] and if [formula] then either [formula] or [formula]. We let Spec(M) be the set of all prime ideals of M. It is equipped with a topology, where the sets

[formula]

form a bases of open sets. Here a is an arbitrary element of M, see [\cite=kato],[\cite=deitmar1],[\cite=deitmar2]. Observe that if f:M1  →  M2 is a homomorphism of monoids then for any prime ideal [formula] the pre-image [formula] is a prime ideal of M1, hence any monoid homomorphism f:M1  →  M2 gives rise to a continuous map

[formula]

It is obvious that the union of prime ideals is again a prime ideal. It is also clear that the empty set is a prime ideal, which is the least prime ideal, and the set of noninvertible elements of M is a prime ideal, which is the greatest prime ideal. Thus Spec(M) is a (topological) monoid with respect to union.

Let [formula] be the monoid with the obvious multiplication. We will equip the set [formula] with the topology, where the subsets [formula] are all open sets. Let [formula] be the free monoid with one generator (of course it is isomorphic to the additive monoid of natural numbers). Then [formula]. Observe that [formula] is an open subset of [formula]. Hence [formula] as topogical monoids.

Observe that {0} is a prime ideal of [formula] (in fact [formula]). Hence for any homomorphism [formula] we have f- 1(0)∈Spec(M). In this way we obtain a map [formula]. The inverse of this map is given as follows, for a prime ideal [formula], we let [formula] be the map given by

[formula]

Now it is easy to check that [formula] is a homomorphism. Hence [formula] defines a map [formula] which is clearly a homomorphism and is the inverse of θ. It is also trivial to check that θ and its inverse are continuous.

Since [formula] takes colimits to limits we have (compare pp. 5 and 6 in [\cite=cort]).

Recall that the category of monoids satisfying the identity a2 = a is equivalent to the category of join semilattices [\cite=grillet]. By a join semilattice we mean a poset L with a least element such that for any two elements a,b∈L there exist the join [formula], which is the least element among the elements x such that a  ≤  x and b  ≤  x. If M is a monoid such that m2 = m holds for all m∈M, then one defines x  ≤  y if xy = y. It is easily seen that in this way we obtain a join semilattice. Conversely, if L is a join semilattice we can consider L as a monoid, with operation

[formula]

The least element of L is the unit in this monoid. It is clear that we have x2 = x for all x∈L.

We let [formula] be the full subcategory of monoids M satisfying the identity x2 = x for all x. For example we have [formula]. It is well-known (and trivial) that the inclusion [formula] has a left adjoint functor M  ↦  Msl, where Msl is the quotient of M by the smallest congruence ~   for which x  ~  x2 for any x∈M. For example [formula]. For the reader familiar to the tensor product of commutative monoids we also mention the isomorphism [formula]. However we will not make use of this fact. As it follows from Lemma [\ref=spec=hom] and Corollary [\ref=spsp] below, the object [formula] is a dualizing object in the category of finite monoids satisfying the identity m2 = m, that is for any such M the following map is an isomorphism

[formula]

where [formula]

By definition of Msl for any [formula] one has [formula]. By putting [formula] the result follows from Lemma [\ref=spec=hom].

As a consequence we obtain the following fact which sharpens Lemma 4.2 in [\cite=deitmar2]. We will make use of the following description of Msl. Thanks to Theorem 1.2 of Chapter III in [\cite=grillet]) one has Msl = M /   ~   where a  ~  b provided there exist natural numbers m,n  ≥  1 and elements u,v∈M such that am = ub and bn = va.

It suffice to show that Bsl  →  Asl is an isomorphism. Take any element a∈A, since a  ~  an for all n we see that the map in question is surjective. Now take two elements b1,b2 in B and assume b1  ~  b2 in A. Then there are u,v∈A such that bk1 = ub2 and bm2 = vb1. Take N such that u1 = uN∈B and v1 = vN∈B. Then bkN1 = u1bN2 and bN2 = v1bN1. Thus b1  ~  b2 in B and we are done.

Spectrum of semilattices

By the reduction lemma [\ref=red] the study of the spectrum of commutative monoids, reduces to the study of the spectrum of semilattices. Before we go further let us fix some terminology.

Adjoint maps of morphisms of semilattices

The main result of this section is probably well-known to experts, but I couldn't find any references.

For a poset P we let Pop be the poset, which is P as a set, but with the reverse ordering. We sometimes use the notations

[formula]

for the greatest and least elements of P.

Let X and Y be posets. Assume f:X  →  Y and g:Y  →  X be maps. We say that g is a left adjoint of f and f is a right adjoint of g, if

[formula]

As a specialization of the well-known facts from the category theory we can conclude that if f has a left or right adjoint then it is unique. We sometimes write g = f* for the left adjoint of f and [formula] for the right adjoint of g.

A lattice is a poset L which is simultaneously a join and meet semi-lattice (that is the opposite poset is a join semi-lattice).

First we show that L posses the greatest element. In fact, if [formula], then [formula] is the greatest element. Now for any a,b∈L we consider the subset

[formula]

It is clear that the least element belongs to Qa,b, so it is nonempty. It is also clear that Qa,b is a join subsemilattice of L. Thus Qa,b has the greatest element [formula] and we are done.

If f:L  →  L' is a morphism of finite join semilattices then as we have seen L and L' are lattices, but in general f needs not to be a morphism of lattices. However we have the following

Take an element y∈L' and consider the set

[formula]

We claim that Qf,y is a join subsemilattice of L. First, the least element of L belongs to Qf,y and next, if x1,x2∈Qf,y, then f(xi)  ≤  y for i = 1,2. Hence

[formula]

and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=g_ex] Qf,y has the greatest element. Hence we can use Proposition [\ref=ra] to deduce existence of [formula]. Take now y1,y2∈Y. Then we have [formula]. Hence

[formula]

and the first assertion is proved. A similar argument shows the second assertion.

By Lemma [\ref=g_ex] we can assume that both categories in question have finite lattices as objects. The duality functor from the category of finite join semi-lattices to the category of finite meet semi-lattices is the identity on objects and sends a join semi-lattice morphism f into [formula]. The functor in the opposite direction is also identity on objects and sends a meet semi-lattice morphism g into g*.

Spec of finite semilattices

Lemma [\ref=red] reduces the study of Spec(M) to the case when M is a join semilattice. Our aim is now to prove that for finite (=finitely generated) semilattice L there exist a "natural" homeomorphism αL:L  →  Spec(L), where L is equipped with a topology, where open sets are exactly ideals of L.

Let L be a join semilattice considered as a monoid. Take an element a∈L and consider the set

[formula]

Let α(a) be the complement of Qa in L. Then we have

Take a∈L. Then we have

[formula]

and the first assertion follows. We also have

[formula]

[formula]

Thus α- 1(D(a)) = (a) and the second assertion also follows.

To see that the diagram commutes it suffice to prove that

[formula]

Take y∈L'. Then [formula] and we are done.

The second part is a direct consequence of the first one. Since the bijection αL reverses the ordering the first part follows.

Combine Theorem [\ref=mt] and Theorem [\ref=red] to obtain the following result.

Infinite semilatices and not-finitely generated monoids

Asumume L is a semilatice. We let Lλ denote the collection of all finitely generated subsemilattices of L. Observe that each Lλ is finite and they form a filtered system with respect to inclusion. If fλ,η:Lλ  ⊂  Lη is an inclusion of finite subsemilattices, we have induced surjective morphism of dual meet-semilatices

[formula]

In this way one obtains the inverse system of finite meet-semilattices. Let L∞ be the inverse limits of this system

Since L = colim  Lλ the result follows from Corollary [\ref=zg].

In this way we obtain a contravariant functor L  ↦  L∞ from the category of semilattices to the category of profine semilattices. For L = Msl we write Msl∞ for L∞. Thus M  →  Msl∞ is a contavariant functor from monoids to the category of profinite semilatices. Combining the previous results we obtain a bijection

[formula]

for any commutative monoid M.
