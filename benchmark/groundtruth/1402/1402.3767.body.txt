De Rham cohomology of CP1 model with Hopf term

The CP1 model is a complex extension of the Heisenberg O(3) model. The O(3) model emerges in various physical applications from high energy physics [\cite=niemi] to condensed matter physics [\cite=babaev]. Recently, there have been some progresses in knotted solitons [\cite=niemi2]. The action of the CP1 model with the Hopf term possesses a desirable manifest locality since the Hopf term has a local integral representation in terms of the physical fields of the CP1 model [\cite=wilczek82]. Our aim is to investigate the Hopf term effects on de Rham cohomology [\cite=derham] [\cite=derham2] [\cite=derham3] [\cite=hong15] [\cite=hong10] involved in the CP1 model possessing the this term. To do this at first we will recapitulate shortly the first class formalism of the CP1 model without the Hopf term [\cite=hong01]. The CP1 model without the Hopf term is defined by the Lagrangian,

[formula]

Here ξα = (ξ1,ξ2) is a multiplet of complex scalar fields satisfying a constraint

[formula]

and thus the CP1 model becomes a second class constrained Hamiltonian system. Exploiting the Lagrangian ([\ref=lag]), we find that the canonical Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

where (πα,π*α) are the canonical momenta conjugate to the complex scalar fields (ξα,ξ*α). By implementing the Dirac algorithm [\cite=dirac64] we find that, together with Eq. ([\ref=omega1]), our Hamiltonian system is subject to another second class constraint

[formula]

Introducing two canonically conjugate Stückelberg fields (θ,πθ) we obtain the first class Hamiltonian

[formula]

where R = |ξα|2 / (|ξα|2 + 2θ).

Up to now, we briefly summarize the first class formalism of the CP1 model appeared in Ref. [\cite=hong01]. Now we are ready to investigate the cohomology group of the CP1 model which is our main theme. Introducing two canonical sets of ghost and anti-ghost fields together with auxiliary fields (ci,i), (pi,i), (ni,bi) (i = 1,2), we define the BRST operator for our constraint algebra

[formula]

from which we find

[formula]

Here one notes that i (i = 1,2) are the first class constraints of the previous second class ones ωi in Eqs. ([\ref=omega1]) and ([\ref=const22]). Moreover, one can readily shows that the BRST charge Q is nilpotent: Q2 = 0.

We choose the unitary gauge with (χ1,χ2) = (ω1,ω2) by selecting the gauge fixing functional

[formula]

We then have

[formula]

which follows from the nilpotentcy of the charge Q. Now the gauge fixed BRST invariant Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

Here one notes that in order to guarantee the BRST invariance of Heff we have included in Heff the Q-exact term, and in H̃ the term possessing πθ and the Faddeev-Popov ghost term [\cite=faddeev67]. Moreover, the term δQψ fixes the particular unitary gauge corresponding to the fixed point (θ = 0,πθ = 0) in the gauge degrees of freedom associated with two-dimensional manifold described by the internal phase space coordinates (θ,πθ), which are two canonically conjugate Stückelberg fields.

Next, we introduce the BRST operator via

[formula]

where αp is a ghost number p-form. We then can construct the p-th de Rham cohomology group Cp(M,R) of the manifold M and the field of real number R with the following quotient group [\cite=derham] [\cite=derham2] [\cite=derham3] [\cite=hong15] [\cite=hong10]

[formula]

Here Zp(M,R) are the collection of all Q-closed ghost number p-forms αp for which Qαp = 0, and Bp(M,R) are the collection of all Q-exact ghost number p-forms αp for which αp = Qαp - 1.

The Hamiltonians H̃ and Heff are readily shown to be the ghost number 0-forms, and they are Q-closed as in the case of δQψ. These Hamiltonians thus can be used to define the Z0(M,R). Here M is the non-compact Hilbert space of the CP1 model and R is the real number field. Next, we notice that ψ is the ghost number ( - 1)-form and Qψ is Q-exact ghost number 0-form, so that we can define the B0(M,R). With these Z0(M,R) and B0(M,R), we construct the 0-th de Rham cohomology group C0(M,R):

[formula]

It is interesting to note that the ghost number 0-form Heff is deformed into the other ghost number 0-form H̃. Namely, Heff is homologous to H̃ under the BRST transformation Q, or Heff  ~  H̃, since Qψ  =  H̃ - Heff. These features also appear [\cite=hong15] [\cite=hong10] even in the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole [\cite=thooft742] [\cite=polyakov74], which is physics-wise different from the CP1 model.

Now we generalize the above results to the CP1 model with Hopf term. The new Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

Here one notes that our physical system with the Hopf term also respects the constraints ωi (i = 1,2) in Eqs. ([\ref=omega1]) and ([\ref=const22]). Following the same algorithm discussed above, we arrive at the first class Hamiltonian with Hopf term [\cite=hong02]

[formula]

Here πHα originates from the canonical momenta conjugate to the complex scalar fields ξα associated with the CP1 Lagrangian with the Hopf term ([\ref=l0h]), while πΘα is related with the difference between πα and πHα. Introducing the ghost and anti-ghost fields together with their auxiliary fields as above, we obtain the identities

[formula]

Resorting to the routine procedure above, we proceed to formulate the cohomology group as follows

[formula]

Here on notes that the non-compact Hilbert space M is modified into the non-compact MH due to the Hopf term in the CP1 model.

In conclusion, we have studied the CP1 model possessing the Hopf term which respects the second class constraints and is related with the BRST operator Q. Exploiting Q, we have explicitly constructed its de Rham cohomology group by deriving the ensuing quotient group via both the collections of all Q-closed and Q-exact ghost number p-forms. Moreover, we have introduced the CP1 model without the Hopf term to investigate the ensuing effect of the Hopf term on the cohomology group. We have concluded that the Hopf term effects on the de Rham cohomology originate from the non-compact Hilbert space modified by this Hopf term. This is one of main results of the algebraic topology aspects of the CP1 model with the Hopf term.
