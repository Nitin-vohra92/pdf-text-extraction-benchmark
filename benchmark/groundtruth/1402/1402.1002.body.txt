On Transiso Graph

Mathematical Subject Classification (2010): Key words: Right loop; Normalized right transversal; Complete Graph

Introduction

Let G be a finite group and H be a subgroup of G. A right transversal S of H in G is a subset of G obtained by selecting one and only one element from each right coset of H in G. S is normalized right transversal (NRT) if 1∈S. An NRT S has an induced binary operation [formula] given by [formula], with respect to which S is a right loop with identity 1, that is, a right quasigroup with both sided identity (see [\cite=smth],[\cite=rltr]). Conversely, every right loop can be embedded as a normalized right transversal in a group with some universal property (see [\cite=rltr]). Let 〈S〉 be the subgroup of G generated by S and HS be the subgroup [formula]. Then [formula] and HSS = 〈S〉 (see [\cite=rltr]).

Identifying S with the set [formula] of all right cosets of H in G, we get a transitive permutation representation χS:G  →  Sym(S) defined by [formula]. The kernal ker χS of this action is CoreG(H), the core of H in G. Let GS  =  χS(HS). This group is known as the group torsion of the right loop S (see [\cite=rltr]). The group GS depends only on the right loop structure [formula] on S and not on the subgroup H. Since χS is injective on S and if we identify S with χS(S), then χS(〈S〉) = GSS which also depends only on the right loop S and S is an NRT of GS in GSS. One can also verify that ker(χS|HSS:HSS  →  GSS) = ker(χS|HS:HS  →  GS) = CoreHSS(HS) and χS|S=the identity map on S. If H is a corefree subgroup of G, then there exists an NRT T of H in G which generates G (see [\cite=cam]). In this case, [formula] and [formula]. Also [formula] is a group if and only if GS trivial.

Let T(G,H) denote the set of all normalized right transversals (NRTs) of H in G. Two NRTs S , T∈T(G,H) are said to be isomorphic (denoted by [formula]), if their induced right loop structures are isomorphic. A subgroup H is normal in G if and only if all NRTs of H in G are isomorphic to G / H (see [\cite=rltr]).

Let V be a set. Denote by E(V) = {{u,v}|u,v∈V,u  ≠  v}, the 2-sets of V. A pair Γ = (V,E) with E  ⊆  E(V) is called a graph on V (see [\cite=rd]). The elements of V are called the vertices of Γ and those of E the edges of Γ. If {u,v}∈E, then we say that u and v are adjacent. The number |V| is called the order of Γ. A graph of order 0 or 1 is called as the trivial graph. The graph [formula] is called as the empty graph. The graph Γ is called as complete if any two vertices are adjacent.

Transiso Graph

Let G be a finite group and d be divisor of |G| (order of G).Let Vd be the set of all subgroups of G of order d. We define a graph Γd(G) = (Vd,Ed) with {H1,H2}∈Ed if and only if there exists Si∈T(G,Hi) (i = 1,2) such that [formula] with respect to the right loop structure induced on Si. We will call this graph a transiso graph.

A finite cyclic group Cn of order n has unique subgroup corresponding to each divisor d of n so Γd(Cn) is pointed graph for each divisor d of n.

Let G = C2  ×  C4  =  〈a,b;a2,b4,aba- 1b- 1〉. One can easily observe that V2  =  {H1  =  〈a〉,H2  =  〈b2〉,H3  =  〈ab2〉} and V4  =  {K1  =  〈b〉,K2  =  〈ab〉,H3  =  〈a,b2〉}. Also [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. We show the connectivity of subgroups in following pictorial form:

A subgroup of a group G is always adjacent with its automorphic images in Γd(G) for any divisor d of |G|.

Let H be a subgroup of a group G. Let f be an automorphism of G and K = f(H). Choose S1∈T(G,H). Let S2 = f(S1). Observe that S2∈T(G,K).

Let x,y∈S1. Then [formula]. This implies that f|S1:S1  →  S2 is a right loop isomorphism. Hence, H and K are adjacent in Γd(G).

Converse of Proposition [\ref=p1] is not true in general (see Example [\ref=e1]). Let δ(G) denotes the number of divisors of |G| for which there is a subgroup of G of that order.

If number of orbits of the action of [formula] on the set V of all subgroups of G is equal to δ(G), then Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of |G|.

Let H1 and H2 be corefree subgroups of G. Let Si∈T(G,Hi) (i = 1,2) such that [formula] and 〈Si〉 = G. Then an isomorphism between S1 and S2 can be extended to an automorphism of G which sends H1 onto H2.

Note that [formula] (i = 1,2) and hence HSiSi = G. Let p:S1  →  S2 be a right loop isomorphism. It gives rise to an isomorphism p̃:GS1S1  →  GS2S2 such that p̃(GS1) = GS2 (see the discussion following [\cite=rpsc]). Since Hi (i = 1,2) is corefree, χSi defined in the section 1 is an isomorphism. Now, one can note [formula] is an automorphism of G which is an extension of p and sends H1 to H2.

Let H be a subgroup of Sym(n) of order 2 and S∈T(Sym(n),H). Then [formula] has order at most 2. Assume that |HS| = 2. Then HS = H, so |〈S〉| = |HS| = n! and hence 〈S〉 = Sym(n). Assume that |HS| = 1. Then S is a subgroup of Sym(n) of order [formula]. One can note that H can not be generated by an even permutation of order 2. In this case, S = Alt(n), where Alt(m) denotes the alternating group of degree m.

Let H and K be distinct subgroups of Sym(n) of order 2 generated by odd permutations. Then one can observe that [formula]. Therefore H and K are adjacent in Γ2(Sym(n)).

Let H and K are subgroups of Sym(n) of order 2 generated by even permutations. Then as argued in the above paragraph, all NRTs of H and K generate Sym(n). If H and K are adjacent, then by Proposition [\ref=p2] there is an automorphism sending H onto K. If n  ≠  6, then H and K conjugate (for [formula] for n  ≠  6 (see [\cite=suz])). If n = 6, then H and K are again conjugate (for all automorphisms of Sym(6) send a permutation of cycle type (2,2,1,1) to permutation of cycle type (2,2,1,1)). Moreover, if H and K are conjugate, the by Proposition [\ref=p1] H and K are adjacent.

Now if H is generated by an even permutation of order 2 and K is generated by an odd permutation of order 2, then they are not adjacent in Γ2(Sym(n)) (for otherwise they will be conjugate).

Since all subgroups of Alt(n) (n  ≤  5) of same order are conjugate, by Proposition [\ref=p1] Γd(Alt(n)) (n  ≤  5) is complete for each divisor d of [formula]. As argued above, one can observe that Γ2(Alt(n)) (n  ≥  8) is not complete.

Let n  ≥  6. Let H1 and H2 be two subgroups of Alt(n) such that [formula] and [formula]. Since Alt(m) (m  ≥  5) has no subgroup of index less than m, |HSi|  ≠  1 and |HSi|  ≠  2 (i = 1,2). This implies that |HSi| = 4 (i = 1,2). Hence, all members of T(Alt(n),Hi) generates Alt(n). Now, by Proposition [\ref=p2] one observes that H1 and H2 are not adjacent in Γ4(Alt(n)).

For a finite abelian group G, Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of |G| if and only if each sylow subgroup of G is either elementary abelian or cyclic.

One can easily check the 'if' part. We will observe the 'only if' part.

Assume that G is not isomorphic to the group stated in the proposition and Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of |G|. Then by Fundamental Theorem of abelian groups, there must be a summand of G isomorphic to Cpα  ×  Cpβ for some prime divisor p of |G|, where α,β are positive integers and atleast one of α and β is greater than 1. Without any loss, let us assume that α > 1 and Cpα  ×  Cpβ is at first place.

If α  >  β  ≥  1, then there exist two subgroups H1 and H2 such that [formula] and [formula]. One can observe that [formula]. This is a contradiction.

If α  =  β > 1, then there exist two subgroups H1 and H2 such that [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula]. This is again a contradiction.

If G is elementary abelian group, then Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of |G|.

Let D2n denotes the dihedral group of order 2n. We need following elementary lemma to prove that Γd(D2n) is complete for each divisor d of |G|. The proof of following Lemma can be found in [\cite=sr] and [\cite=kc].

A subgroup a dihedral group D2n  =  〈a,b;an,b2,(ba)2〉 is either cyclic or dihedral. Moreover if m is a divisor of 2n and

m is odd then all m subgroups of index m are conjugate to 〈am,b〉.

m is even and m does not divide n then there is only one subgroup [formula] of index m.

m is even and m divides n then a subgroup of index m is either [formula] or conjugate to exactly one of 〈am,b〉 or 〈am,ba〉.

Let D2n denote the dihedral group of order 2n. Then Γd(D2n) is complete for each divisor d of 2n.

Let G = D2n  =  〈a,b;an,b2,(ba)2〉. Let d be a divisor of 2n and [formula].

Assume that m is odd. Then by Lemma [\ref=l1], there are m subgroups of G of order d and all are conjugate to 〈am,b〉. Therefore, by Proposition [\ref=p1], Γd(G) is complete for the divisor d for which m is odd.

Assume that m is even and m does not divide n. Then, by Lemma [\ref=l1] there is only one subgroup [formula] of order d. Therefore, Γd(G) is complete for the divisor d for which m is even and m does not divide n.

Finally, assume that m is even and m divides n. Then by Lemma [\ref=l1], a subgroup of order d is either [formula] or conjugate to exactly one of 〈am,b〉 or 〈am,ba〉. Let [formula], H2  =  〈am,b〉 and H3  =  〈am,ba〉. Note that H1 is a normal subgroup of G. Hence, all NRTs of H1 in G are isomorphic to [formula].

Now choose [formula] in T(D2n,H2) and [formula] in T(D2n,H3). Note that 〈S2〉  =  〈a2,ba〉 and 〈S3〉  =  〈a2,b〉. Then [formula] and [formula]. Therefore GS2 = GS3  =  {1} and hence S2 and S3 are groups.

Let [formula] denote the induced binary operation on S2 as described in the first paragraph of section [\ref=int]. One can observe that, [formula]. This implies that [formula]. Similarly [formula]. This shows that Γd(G) is complete also in this case.

Let Q8 denote the quaternion group of order 8. Then each subgroup of Q8 is normal in Q8. Hence, Γd(Q8) is complete graph for each divisor d of 8. Note that each NRT of subgroups of order 2 generates Q8. The converse of this is also true as observed below:

Let G be a non-abelian finite p-group with all NRTs of a subgroup of index greater than p generate G and Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of |G|. Then [formula].

Let H1 and H2 be subgroups of G of same index greater than p. Since each finite p-group has a normal subgroup for each divisor of |G|, we can take [formula]. Choose S1∈T(G,H1), S2∈T(G,H2) such that [formula]. By the assumption 〈S1〉  =  〈S2〉 = G. This implies that HS1 = H1, HS2 = H2. Since [formula], S2 is a group. This implies that GS2  =  {1}. Since [formula], [formula] (see the discussion following [\cite=rpsc]). Since [formula], H1 is also normal in G. Hence G is a Dedekind group (see [\cite=rob]). Since G is finite p-group, by [\cite=rob] G is isomorphic to Q8 or Q8  ×  A, where A is an elementary abelian 2-group. Assume that [formula]. Let H be a subgroup of A of order 2. Then one can note that an NRT of H in G does not generate G. This is a contradiction. Thus [formula]

Complete Transiso Graph For Lower Prime Power Order Groups

In this section, we determine the completeness of the transiso graph for finite p-group G for divisor p (p an odd prime) upto order p5. We will show that if |G| = p4, then transiso graph Γp(G) is not complete. For the group of order p5, Γp(G) is not complete except [formula], where Φ(G), [formula], Z(G) and Cp denotes the Frattini subgroup, commutator subgroup, center of G and cyclic group of order p respectively. Using the small group library of GAP ([\cite=gap]), we found that the transiso graph Γ3(G) for the 37th group of order 35 is complete. This group is of exponent 3. We will observe that for the extra special group G of order p3 of exponent p, the transiso graph Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of p3.

We further ask to determine the structure of the group G of order pn for which transiso graph Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of pn. This problem can be thought as a dual problem posed in [\cite=ra]. In [\cite=ra], R. Armstrong proves only finite non-abelian p-group all of whose subgroups of same order are isomorphic is the group of order p3 of exponent p. In case of a complete transiso graph we feel that the only finite non-abelian p-group for which transiso graph Γd(G) is complete for each order d is the group of order p3 of exponent p.

Throughout the section, we will adopt following convention. The prime p will always be odd. The group G denotes finite p-group which is not p-central, that is G has non-central subgroup of order p. Whenever we write H or Hi ([formula]), we will always mean that this is a non-normal subgroup of G of order p. Whenever we write the semidirect product [formula] of the groups G1 and G2, we will mean that it is not a direct product.

Let G be a non p-central finite p-group. Then Γp(G) is complete if and only if whenever H is a non-normal subgroup of G of order p, [formula] for some subgroup K of G with [formula] for any normal subgroup L of G of order p.

One can easily observe the 'if' part. We will only prove 'only if' part. Let [formula] of order p. Let L be any normal subgroup of G of order p. Since Γp(G) is complete, there exists S1∈T(G,H) and S2∈T(G,L) such that [formula]. This implies that [formula] (see the discussion following [\cite=rpsc]). Since [formula], GS2  =  {1}. Also, since H is core-free subgroup of G, [formula]. This implies that [formula]. This means that S1 is subgroup of G. Denote it by K. Note that [formula]. This implies that [formula] and [formula] for any [formula].

Let G be a non p-central finite p-group with |Φ(G)| = p and Γp(G) is complete. Then [formula], where [formula] (p - 1 times).

Let G be a finite p-group (p odd prime) with the property that whenever H is a non-normal subgroup of G of order p, G is the semidirect product of H and a normal subgroup K such that all subgroups of K of order p are normal in G and K is isomorphic to the quotient G / L for any normal subgroup L of G of order p. Then K is a cyclic group.

Let H = 〈h〉 be a non-normal subgroup of order p and [formula]. Since K = G / L for any subgroup L of K of order p and all subgroups of K of order p are normal in G, it follows that the image HL / L of H in G / L is normal and hence also central in G / L. So ∈L for all g∈G. Now if K had another subgroup [formula] of order p, then we would also have [formula] and hence = 1 so H  ≤  Z(G), contrary to assumption. So K has a unique subgroup L of order p. This implies that K is a cyclic group.

One can note that Γp(G) is complete, if |G|  ≤  p2. Let G be a group of order p3 and G be non-abelian. From the classification of group of order p3, we note that |Z(G)| = |Φ(G)| = p. By the classification of groups of order p3, there are two non-abelian groups upto isomorphism. One is of exponent p and other is of exponent p2. Let G be a non-abelian group of order p3 of exponent p2. Assume that Γp(G) is complete. By Corollary [\ref=3se1], [formula]. One can note that there is unique subgroup K of G isomorphic to Cp  ×  Cp. Let H be non-normal subgroup of G of order p contained in K. Then [formula]. Thus, by Proposition [\ref=3sp1] Γp(G) is not complete. This is a contradiction. Now, assume that G is non-abelian group of order p3 of exponent p. We will now prove that Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of p3.

First note that all subgroup of G of order p2 are normal in G and their quotient are isomorphic to Cp. Hence Γp2(G) is complete.

Let H be any non normal subgroup of order p. Choose [formula]. Take K = 〈x〉Z(G). One can note that [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=3sp1], Γp(G) is complete.

In Example [\ref=3se2], we have seen that if G is of order p3 of exponent p, then Γd(G) is complete for each divisor d of p3. We now calculate number of vertices of trasiso graph. Note that vertices are subgroups of same order.

Since G is of exponent p, number of elements of order p is p3 - 1. Also if H is a subgroup of G of order p, then there are p - 1 elements in H of order p. Thus, there are [formula] subgroups of order p.

Note that each subgroup of G of order p2 is isomorphic to Cp  ×  Cp. Let x and y be two elements of G of order p which generates a subgroup of order p2. Note that xy = yx. This means that the order of the centralizer CG(x) of x is atleast p2. If |CG(x)| = p3, then x∈Z(G). If |CG(x)| = p2, then CG(x) = 〈x,y〉. This means that Z(G)  ⊆  〈x,y〉. Without any loss, we assume that x∈Z(G). Therefore, to count subgroups of order p2 we only take care of choices for 〈y〉 which are non central. There are p2 + p choices for 〈y〉. Note that there are p subgroups of 〈x,y〉 which are not central. Thus there are [formula] subgroups of order p2.

Let G be a non-abelian group of order p4. Then one can easily observe that Φ(G) is abelian. Let G be a non-abelain group of order p5. Then from a result of [\cite=bkm], which states that if G is a finite p-group (p odd prime) and the center Z(Φ(G)) is cyclic, then Φ(G) is cyclic, one can observe that Φ(G) is abelian in this case also. Now, we have following:

Let G be a non-abelian finite p-group of order either p4 or p5. Then Φ(G) is not a cyclic group unless |Φ(G)| = p.

Let |G| = p4. Assume that [formula]. By [\cite=db], [formula], where E is elementary abelian and both Φ(Q) and Z(Q) are cyclic. Assume that |E| = p2. Then |Q| = p2. Hence G is abelian. This is a contradiction. Similarly |E| = p3 is not possible. Thus, |E| = p, |Q| = p3 and Q will be a non abelian group. Since |Q| = p3, |Φ(Q)| = p. But, by [\cite=gam], [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Let |G| = p5. If Φ(G) is cyclic group of order greater that p, either [formula] or [formula]. Assume that Φ(G) = Cp2. As argued above, the cases |E| = p4 and |E| = p3 are not possible. Therefore, assume that |E| = p2. Then |Q| = p3 and Q is non-abelian. Since |Φ(Q)| = p and |Φ(G)| = p2, by [\cite=gam] we get a contradiction. Assume that |E| = p. Then |Q| = p4. By [\cite=gam], [formula]. Since |Q| = p4, we get a contradiction. Thus [formula]. Similarly [formula].

Let G be a finite p-group and Γp(G) is complete. Then all subgroups of order p which are contained in Φ(G) are normal in G.

Assume that H be subgroup of G contained in Φ(G) which is not normal in G. Then by Proposition [\ref=3sp1], [formula] for some subgroup K of G. But by [\cite=dx], [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Let G be a non-abelain group of order either p4 or p5. Let |Z(G)| = p and Γp(G) is complete. Then Φ(G) = Z(G).

Let G be a finite p-group such that the order of the commutator subgroup [formula] is p. If [formula] and Φ(G) is not cyclic, then Γp(G) is not complete.

Assume that Γp(G) is complete. By Lemma [\ref=3sl2], all subgroups of Φ(G) of order p are normal in G. By Proposition [\ref=3sp1], [formula] and [formula] for any normal subgroup L of order p. Take [formula] and L2  ⊆  Φ(G) such that L2  ≠  L1 and |L2| = p. By Proposition [\ref=3sp1], [formula]. This implies that [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Let G be a group of order p4 such that [formula]. Then Γp(G) is not complete.

Since |Φ(G)| = p2, G = 〈x,y〉 for some x,y∈G. Since [formula], [formula]. But since Z(G) is an elementary abelian group, [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=3sp2], Γp(G) is not complete.

We have following theorem for groups of order p4:

Let G be a group of order p4. Then Γp(G) is not complete.

Assume that Γp(G) is complete. By Lemmas [\ref=3sl1], [\ref=3sl2] and Proposition [\ref=3sp2], we are left with [formula]. Let H be a non-normal subgroup of G. By Proposition [\ref=3sp1], [formula] and [formula]. By [\cite=hab], we have only one choice for G whose numbering in above cited reference is given by 1. By [\cite=hab], [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], we can choose a subgroup K of G of order p distinct from [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=3sp1], [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Let G be a group of order p5 such that |Φ(G)| = p. Then Γp(G) is not complete.

Assume that Γp(G) is complete. Note that [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=3se1], [formula] where H is a non-normal subgroup of G of order p and [formula]. By [\cite=hab], we have only one choice for G which is numbered by 1 in this reference. By [\cite=hab], [formula]. Choose [formula]. Take [formula] and L2  =  〈y〉. Then one can observe that [formula]. This is a contradiction to the Proposition [\ref=3sp1].

Let G be group of order p5 such that |Φ(G)| = p3. Then Γp(G) is not complete.

Assume that Γp(G) is complete. By Lemma [\ref=3sl1], [formula] or [formula]. Assume that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=3sl2], Φ(G)  ⊆  Z(G). Since |G| = p5, Φ(G) = Z(G). By [\cite=hab], there is no group of order p5 such that |Z(G)| = p3 and [formula] and |Z(G)| = p3 and [formula]. Thus [formula]. But by Proposition [\ref=3sp2], we get a contradiction. Thus [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=3sl2], Z(G) contains a subgroup isomorphic to Cp  ×  Cp. By [\cite=hab], there is no group of order p5 such that |Z(G)| = p3 and [formula] or |Z(G)| = p3 and [formula]. Hence [formula] and [formula] is either p or p2. By Proposition [\ref=3sp2], [formula]. Hence [formula]. Assume that [formula]. By [\cite=rj], there is a group in isoclinism family φ8. But in this case, |Z(G)| = p. This is a contradiction. Thus [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=3sl2], [formula]. By [\cite=rj], there are groups in isoclinism family φ4. But, in this case G / Z(G) is an elementary abelian p-group. This is a contradiction.

Let G be group of order p5 such that |Φ(G)| = p2. Then Γp(G) is not complete unless [formula].

Let G be a group of order p5 other than the case [formula]. Assume that Γp(G) is complete. By Lemma [\ref=3sl1], [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=3sp2], [formula]. Hence [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=3sl2], Φ(G)  ⊆  Z(G). By [\cite=hab], there is no group of order p5 such that |Z(G)| = p3 and [formula]. Thus [formula]. This is a contradiction.

We write SmallGroup(n,m) for the mth group of order n as quoted in the "Small Groups" library in GAP ([\cite=gap]). Using GAP calculations, we found that SmallGroup(243,37) satisfies the condition of Proposition [\ref=3sp1]. Hence Γ3(G) is complete, where G=SmallGroup(243,37). One can check that [formula] and [formula].
