Thermodynamically stable lithium silicides and germanides from density-functional theory calculations

Introduction

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the secondary (rechargeable) battery of choice for portable electronic devices due to their high specific energy (energy per unit weight) and energy density (energy per unit volume). LIBs have the highest capacity of all the commercially available battery technologies and are now being deployed in hybrid and all-electric vehicles.[\cite=chu:nature:2012] There is substantial interest in enhancing the capacity of LIBs, driven by the economic and environmental advantages of increasing the range of electric vehicles, and enabling longer-life portable electronic devices.

Lithium intercalated graphite is the standard LIB negative electrode material due to its good rate capability and cyclability, but demand for even higher performance LIBs has motivated the investigation of other materials. Silicon is an attractive alternative since it has ten times the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of graphite (calculated from the initial mass and volume of silicon) but, unlike graphite, silicon undergoes structural changes on lithiation.[\cite=lai:JES:1976] [\cite=wen:JSSC:1981] [\cite=weydanz:JPS:1999] The negative electrode may be studied using a half-cell containing lithium and silicon. The term "anode" applies to the negative electrode during LIB discharge only, so to avoid confusion we refer to lithiation and delithiation of the silicon half-cell which corresponds to charging and discharging the LIB respectively. The first lithiation of the cell at room temperature involves the conversion of crystalline silicon (c-Si) into an amorphous lithium silicide phase (a-LiySi).[\cite=amorphous_LiSi] The onset of amorphization depends on the lithiation rate and has been measured at y  ≈  0.3 in micron-sized (325 mesh) silicon clusters after irreversible SEI (solid-electrolyte interphase) formation has been taken into account.[\cite=key:JACS:2009] [\cite=li:JES:2007] Below a discharge voltage of 50 mV the a-LiySi crystallizes to form a metastable Li15Si4 phase which may become non-stoichiometric, Li15  ±  δSi4, at deep discharge.[\cite=key:JACS:2009] However, at temperatures above 100[formula]C it is possible to form the most lithiated crystalline phase, Li21Si5, electrochemically.[\cite=kwon:AE:2010] Full lithiation of silicon leads to a drastic volume expansion of 270-280%,[\cite=obrovac:JES:2007] which generates considerable mechanical stress. Hysteresis in the capacity/voltage profile occurs due to a combination of mechanical stress and different reactions taking different structural pathways on lithiation and delithiation. The microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still not entirely clear.[\cite=obrovac:JES:2007] a-LiySi has been studied in situ using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),[\cite=key:JACS:2009] X-ray diffraction (XRD) [\cite=Hatchard:JES:2004] [\cite=Obrovac:ESSL:2004] and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). [\cite=kang:IC:2009] These studies along with ex situ NMR and PDF (pair-distribution function) studies of XRD data suggest that silicon forms small clusters and isolated atoms during lithiation. The clusters that form only break apart into isolated silicon atoms at the end of the lithiation process (below 80 mV). [\cite=key:JACS:2011]

Many of the disordered structures that form during lithiation can be approximated by the Li-Si ground-state and metastable crystalline phases. For instance, the crystalline phases have been used as a first step in understanding charge transfer [\cite=chevrier:JAC:2010] and average lithiation voltages.[\cite=chevrier:CJP:2009] To gain insight into the possible types of silicon clusters present and their environments in a-LiySi, various crystalline phases have been investigated and categorized using NMR [\cite=key:JACS:2009] [\cite=koester:AC:2011] and ab initio theoretical techniques. [\cite=chevrier:JES:2010] [\cite=chevrier:JES:2009] [\cite=chevrier:JAC:2010] [\cite=Zeilinger:CoM:2013:Li17Si4] These c-Li-Si phases have previously been well categorized using density-functional theory (DFT),[\cite=chevrier:JES:2010] [\cite=chevrier:JES:2009] [\cite=chevrier:JAC:2010] however new insights into the most lithiated phases and the ability to synthesize Li1Si1 through ball milling have suggested that the system is far from fully understood. The most recent phase diagram of the Li-Si system shows, in ascending lithium content order, c-Si, Li1Si1, Li12Si7, Li7Si3, Li13Si4, Li15Si4, Li22Si5, and β-Li.[\cite=okamoto:JPED:2009] Additionally investigations by Zeilinger and coworkers have presented a high-temperature Li4.11Si phase [\cite=Zeilinger:CoM:2013:Li17Si4] [\cite=Zeilnger:CoM:2013:Li4.11Si] and suggested Li17Si4 as the correct stoichiometry of Li21Si5/Li22Si5.

Germanium is another choice of anode for LIB with a theoretical capacity of 1568 mAh g- 1 some 5 times greater than carbon. Its lithium diffusivity at room temperature is 400 times greater than silicon, [\cite=park:CSR:2010] however it is scarcer and consequently more expensive. About the Li-Ge phase diagram, much less is known. In increasing order of lithium content, the following stable phases have all been proposed: Li7Ge12,[\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] Li1Ge1,[\cite=menges:ZN:1969] [\cite=evers:ACIE:1987] Li12Ge7,[\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] Li11Ge6,[\cite=frank:ZN:1975] Li9Ge4,[\cite=hopf:ZN:1970] [\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] Li7Ge3,[\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] [\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] Li7Ge2,[\cite=hopf:ZN:1972] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] Li15Ge4,[\cite=gladyshevskii:SPC:1961] [\cite=johnson:AC:1965] [\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] Li17Ge4[\cite=goward:JAC:2001] and Li22Ge5.[\cite=gladyshevskii:SPC:1964] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] [\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] More crystalline phases occur during electrochemical lithiation of germanium than silicon; XRD and HRTEM measurements show that during lithiation of germanium at room temperature, the Li-Ge system progressed through Li9Ge4, Li7Ge2 and a mixture of Li15Ge4 and Li22Ge5. [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008]

In this article we use atomic species swapping along with random structure searching techniques, described in Sec. [\ref=methods], to predict ground state and metastable crystal structures of the Li-Si and and Li-Ge systems. In Sec. [\ref=voltages] our approach to calculating average voltages is discussed and Secs [\ref=LiSi] and  [\ref=LiGe] describe the DFT-predicted phases of Li-Si and Li-Ge respectively. In the Li-Si system we predict a high-density Li1Si1 phase with P4 / mmm symmetry and discuss the tendency for silicon to form dumbbells within the lithium silicides. We then turn our attention to Li-Ge which has not been analyzed using these computational search methods method before and predict the new structures, Li5Ge2, Li13Ge5, Li8Ge3 and Li13Ge4. The average voltages for the Li-Si and Li-Ge systems are presented including the Li17Si4 and Li1Si1 phases. The conclusions of the simulations are given in Sec. [\ref=Sect:Conclusions].

Methods

Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) has been successful in predicting the ground-state structures of high-pressure phases of matter.[\cite=pickard:PRL:2006] [\cite=Pickard_AIRSS] More recently is has also been applied to the Li-P system [\cite=ivanov:ACIE:2012] and defects in technologically relevant ceramics, [\cite=mulroue:PRB:2011] [\cite=mulroue:JNM:2013] semiconductors [\cite=morris:PRB:2008] [\cite=morris:PRB:2009] and LIBs. [\cite=morris:PRB:2011] [\cite=morris:PRB:2013] Since in an AIRSS calculation each random starting configuration is independent from another, the search algorithm is trivially parallelisable, making high-throughput computation straightforward. AIRSS searches were performed for stoichiometries LixSiy and LixGey where x,y = 1 - 8.

Relaxations were performed using the stoichiometric crystal structures of Li-Si, Li-Ge, Li-Sn, Li-Pb, Na-Si, Na-Ge, Na-Sn, Na-Pb, K-Si, K-Ge, K-Sn and K-Pb. First, the structures were obtained from the International Crystallographic Structure Database (ICSD). Second, for each structure the anions were replaced with Li and the cations replaced with {Si,Ge}. The structures were relaxed to local-energy minima using forces and stresses calculated by DFT.

Calculations were performed using the plane wave castep DFT code.[\cite=CASTEP:ZK:2004] The PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) exchange-correlation functional was used with Vanderbilt "ultrasoft" pseudopotentials. The Li-Si system required a basis set containing plane waves with energies of up to 400 eV and a Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grid corresponding to a Brillouin zone (BZ) sampling grid finer than 2π  ×  0.05  Å- 1. The Li-Ge system required a 600 eV planewave cutoff with harder pseudopotentials and a BZ sampling finer than [formula].

We define the formation energy per atom of a compound LimXn, where X = {Si,Ge} as,

[formula]

where [formula] is the total DFT energy of a given structure, LinXm and μLi and μX are the chemical potentials of atomic species Li and X in their ground state elemental structure. To compare the stabilities of different stoichiometries we plot the formation energy per atom, Ef / A versus the fractional concentration of lithium in a compound where,

[formula]

and, as above, n and m are the number of atoms of Li and X in a compound respectively. Drawing a convex hull from (CLi,Ef / A) = (0,0) to (1,0), that is, between the chemical potentials, reveals the stable zero Kelvin structures at the vertices of the tie-lines.

Voltages

We calculate average voltages in an LIB anode using DFT total energies by assuming that all the displaced charge is due to Li and that the reaction proceeds sequentially through the phases on the tie-lines of the convex hull, i.e. it is a succession of two-phase reactions.[\cite=aydinol:PRB:1997] The voltage is given by,

[formula]

where the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG is in eV and Δx is the change in the number of lithium atoms per silicon atoms in the 2 phases. The Gibbs free energy is composed of a number of terms,

[formula]

where ΔE is the total electronic energy, and P, ΔV, T and ΔS are the pressure, change in volume, thermodynamic temperature and change in entropy respectively. Due to the difficulty in calculating ΔG we make the approximation, previously applied to the Li-Si system, that ΔG  ≈  ΔE since ΔE is of the order of a few electron volts, PΔV  ≈  10- 5 eV and TΔS  ≈  0.06 eV at [formula]. [\cite=chevrier:CJP:2009] [\cite=courtney:PRB:1998] [\cite=tipton:PRB:2013]

Results - Lithium Silicide

We find on the convex hull, shown Fig. [\ref=Fig:LiSihull], in increasing lithium content order; diamond-structure [formula] c-Si; the I41 / a Li1Si1 phase[\cite=stearns:JSSC:2003] [\cite=kubota:JAC:2008] which has recently been synthesized at ambient pressure [\cite=tang:JES:2013] and is discussed in Sec. [\ref=Sect:Li1Si1]; the Pnma Li12Si7 phase [\cite=nesper:CB:1986] which contains silicon 5-membered rings and 4-membered stars, which have been studied using NMR;[\cite=koester:AC:2011] the Li7Si3 and Li5Si2 phases with P3212 and [formula] symmetries respectively discussed further in Sec. [\ref=Sect:Li5Si2]; the Pbam Li13Si4 phase; the metastable [formula] Li15Si4; and the Li17Si4 [formula] symmetry phase discussed further in Sec. [\ref=Sect:Li17Si4].

For Li15Si4, Mulikan analysis yields a charge of 0.15|e| and - 0.57|e| per Li and Si respectively; in agreement with Bader analysis that Li is a cation[\cite=chevrier:JAC:2010] and contrary to the reports that Li is anionic.[\cite=kubota:JAP:2007]

The average voltage was calculated between all adjacent pairs of stable Li-Si phases on the convex hull including both the Li17Si4 phase and Li1Si1 phase recently synthesized at ambient pressure. Voltages were obtained from the DFT total energies, as described in Sec. [\ref=voltages] and referenced to lithium metal. The potential composition curve is presented in Fig [\ref=Fig:LiSi_voltages] as is in agreement with previous experimental and theoretical work.

Li1Si1 layered structures

We find a set of structures with Li1Si1 stoichiometry, listed in Table [\ref=Table:Li1Si1], all within [formula]eV/f.u. of the ground state. The DFT ground state at 0 GPa is a I41 / a phase comprising a 3-fold coordinated silicon network hosting lithium tetrahedra similar to the {4Li,V} Zintl defect in silicon. [\cite=morris:PRB:2013] Recently the I41 / a phase has been synthesized via ball-milling and shown to be stable under ambient conditions.[\cite=tang:JES:2013] Mulikan analysis yields a charge of 0.34|e| for each Li and - 0.34|e| for each Si establishing Li as cationic contrary to a previous analysis.[\cite=kubota:JAC:2008]

DFT predicts a novel P4 / mmm phase with a formation energy of 0.07 eV p.f.u. at 0 GPa. It is a layered structure comprising a two-dimensional (non-tetrahedrally) four-fold coordinated silicon lattice with lithium intercalated between the silicon sheets. Since the silicon is four-fold coordinated it gains less of the lithium's charge than in the I41 / a phase; Mulikan analysis shows lithium atoms donate 0.22|e| each. Our calculations show the Li1Si1 system undergoes a phase transition from the I41 / a to the P4 / mmm phase at 2.5 GPa.

The I41 / amd phase is isostructural to its Li1Ge1 analogue. Li1Ge1 I41 / amd is stable at high pressure,[\cite=evers:ACIE:1987] however Li1Si1 I41 / amd is not globally stable over the pressure range we studied (between 0 and 10 GPa).

The [formula] phase contains 6 membered rings of 3-fold coordinated silicon atoms in layered sheets, see Fig [\ref=Fig:LiSi_montage]. The silicon network is isostructural to silicene, a silicon analogue of graphene. We calculate that silicene and a phase based on the P4 / mmm silicon network are 0.63 and 0.89 eV p.f.u. respectively above the [formula] ground state. When lithiated both layered structures are only 0.07 eV above the (I41 / a) ground state. Given the interest in silicene our layered compounds might provide an alternative route to layered silicon.

Li7Si3 and Li5Si2

Lithium's position in the crystal lattice can be difficult to establish due to its low XRD scattering factor. Furthermore, Li7Si3 has partially occupied lattice sites[\cite=vonSchnering:ZM:1980] making it difficult to model using DFT. Its structure may be represented as a supercell of [formula] Li5Si2 in which lithium atoms have been removed from certain lattice sites. [\cite=barvik:CJPB:1983] By choosing different combinations of lithium sites in the supercell, models of Li7Si3 can be produced with [formula], C2 / m Cm and P3212 symmetries. The latter, labeled "#2" by Dahn et al., [\cite=chevrier:JAC:2010] is found on the convex hull.

It is unsurprising that at zero Kelvin, DFT also predicts that the [formula] Li5Si2 phase to be stable since it contains entirely occupied lithium sites. Tipton et al. also found this phase to be stable using DFT. [\cite=tipton:PRB:2013]

Most lithiated phases

The most lithiated stable Li-Si phase has been the subject of debate. XRD measurements predict that Li21Si5 [\cite=nesper:JSSC:1987] is stable at room temperature and Li22Si5 at 415oC [\cite=wen:JSSC:1981]. Previous DFT calculations predict Li21Si5 to be the stabler phase, even after the inclusion of temperature dependence using the harmonic approximation.[\cite=chevrier:JAC:2010] The combined AIRSS/species-swapping technique predicts Li21Si5 and Li22Si5 to be locally stable but above the convex hull. The Li17Si4 phase is on the convex hull, and it has the same crystal structure as [formula] Li17Pb4, as discovered independently by Zeilinger et al. [\cite=Zeilinger:CoM:2013:Li17Si4] Zeilinger et al. also predict a Li4.11Si high-temperature phase which they model using Li16Si4 and Li16.5Si4 phases. We include Zeilinger et al.'s models in Fig. [\ref=Fig:LiSihull] although DFT predicts that they are not on the tie-line.

Repeating units - Silicon dumbbells

We also find a [formula] Li8Si3 and a [formula] Li13Si4 phase close above the tie-line. They belong to the set of structures in the range Li7Si3  →   Li13Si5 which all contain silicon dumbbells. The dumbbells are aligned in parallel with various numbers of collinear lithium atoms between them forming one-dimensional repeating sequences, see Table [\ref=table:columns]. The 1D linear repeating chains are thus packed alongside each other realizing the three-dimensional structure. For example, since Li7Si3 comprises (5×  Li + Si-Si) and (4×  Li + Si-Si) sequences in a ratio of 2:1, it is equivalent to the Li5Si2 phase with lithium vacancies. Li5Si2 comprises sequences of atoms with the repeating unit (5×  Li + Si-Si) and the Li8Si3 is similar but with atoms in a (4×  Li + Si + 4×  Li + Si-Si) repeating unit; it is isostructural with a Li8Pb3 phase. [\cite=cenzual:ZK:1990] The Li13Si5 phase is isostructural with the Li13Sn5 phase [\cite=frank:ZN:1975:Li3Sn5] and has two different repeating units (5×  Li + Si) and (4×  Li + Si-Si) in a ratio of 1:2.

Finally, in Li13Si4 the one-dimensional columnar structure does not exist but Si-Si dumbbells and Si isolated atoms remain in a ratio of 1:1. At higher lithium concentrations, Li15Si4 forms, in which all silicon dumbbells are broken, and only isolated Si atoms remain. The propensity for silicon dumbbells to form over a wide range of stoichiometries and total energies implies that silicon dumbbells form on lithiation of silicon in a LIB anode.

Results - Lithium Germanide

In order of lithium content, the following Li-Ge phases have all been proposed: Li7Ge12, Li1Ge1, Li12Ge7, Li11Ge6, Li9Ge4, Li7Ge3, Li7Ge2, Li15Ge4, Li17Ge4 and Li22Ge5. Below we compare in detail the known phases to the results of the DFT searches.

Li7Ge12 is the only reported phase with a ratio of Li/Ge less than 1. It has two symmetries associated with it, originally Pmn21 [\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] [\cite=gruttner:ACIE:1982], which was later disputed,[\cite=sangster:JPE:1997] and more recently, P2 / n.[\cite=kiefer:SSS:2011] Four of its lithium lattice sites are 50% occupied. We model its structure in a periodic lattice using a simulation cell containing 28 Li and 48 Ge sites. The fractionally occupied sites can be filled in a variety of ways: all sites, giving rise to a crystal symmetry P2 / c: one site (P1), four different ways (all degenerate): two sites, 6 ways (Pc, P2 or [formula]) each symmetry being doubly degenerate): three sites (P1) four ways (all degenerate): and by leaving all empty (P2 / c) one way. A convex hull of their single point energies shows that the (Pc) version is the most stable, hence we use this throughout the rest of the calculations. Although not on the Li-Ge convex hull, see Fig. [\ref=Fig:LiGe_hull], this Pc predicted phase is close above.

Li1Ge1 has an I41 / a [\cite=menges:ZFNB:1969] ground state and a I41 / amd [\cite=evers:AC:1987] high pressure form. DFT predicts I41 / amd and a new layered P4 / mmm phase [formula] eV/f.u. and [formula] eV/f.u. above the I41 / a ground state respectively. The P4 / mmm phase is isostructural with the Li-Si phase discussed above in Sec. [\ref=Sect:Li1Si1]. DFT predicts that the system undergoes a phase transition from the I41 / amd to the P4 / mmm phase at 5 GPa.

Grüttner et al. mentioned a Li12Ge7 phase isotypic with the corresponding Li12Si7 phase [\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] in a very brief report, but did not present any further data to support its discovery. DFT also predicts a Li12Ge7 Pnma phase near the tie-line.

Li11Ge6 was synthesized by Frank et al. [\cite=frank:ZN:1975] with a molecular volume of 172.3 cm3mol- 1. Nesper et al. [\cite=nesper:JSSC:1986] claim that the phase is actually Li8MgGe6, suggesting that since Li8MgGe6 has a molecular volume of 166.5 cm3mol- 1 it is unlikely that Li11Ge6 could have two more atoms per formula unit. DFT also finds a Li11Ge6 Cmcm phase slightly above the tie-line with a volume of 286.26 Å3 per f.u., which corresponds to a molecular volume of 172.4 cm3mol- 1. Hence it seems entirely possible to us that Li11Ge6 Cmcm was synthesized by Frank et al. as initially proposed.

Li9Ge4 in the Cmcm symmetry group, have been made electrochemically and from high temperature fusion, [\cite=sangster:JPE:1997] [\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] but all of our calculations show it well above the tie line, favoring disproportion into a P3212 Li7Ge3 phase. Li7Ge3 with P3212 symmetry was first mentioned by ref. [\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] but no supporting information was given. Jain et al. found an unknown phase that they suggested was Li7Ge3 fitting the diffraction data to [formula] symmetry.[\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] Hence we suggest that Jain et al. synthesized either the Li5Ge2 or indeed Li8Ge3 phases, DFT predicting that both phases have the [formula] symmetry. Li5Ge2 is above the tie-line and Li13Ge5 and Li8Ge3 are all stable although to the best of our knowledge they have not previously been presented in the literature. This may be due to thermal effects, see the discussion of similar arguments for Li5Si2 in Sec. [\ref=Sect:Li5Si2]. Li16Ge5 was predicted by St. John, et al. [\cite=st.john:JES:1982] during electrochemical studies. They presented no crystal structure nor is there any prototype structure of {Li/Na}{Si/Ge/Sn/Pb} with this stoichiometry. DFT predicts a Li13Ge4 Pbam phase, isostructural with the Li13Si4 phase which is slightly above the tie-line and with a similar Li:Si ratio to Li16Ge5. Recently preliminary results by H. Jung et al. [\cite=Jung:Unp:2013] have produced electrochemically new phases in the Li2.33Ge - Li3.5Ge range whose X-ray pair distribution functions (PDF) match at least one of our predicted phases. A fuller investigation will be presented later.

The Li7Ge2 phase with Cmmm symmetry can be made electrochemically and by annealing from high temperature melt. [\cite=sangster:JPE:1997] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] DFT-GGA predicts the [formula] phase above the tie-line and 0.08 eV/f.u more stable than the Cmmm phase. This discrepancy remains after using harder pseudopotentials and either the LDA exchange-correlation or the HSE06 hybrid functional. [\cite=krukau:JCP:2006] A fuller investigation into this will be presented elsewhere.

We find the well known Li15Ge4 stoichiometry [formula] phase stable.[\cite=jain:JPPC:2013] [\cite=yoon:ESSL:2008] [\cite=gladyshevskii:SPC:1961] [\cite=johnson:AC:1965] The most lithiated phase has been a matter of debate in all Li-Group 4 compounds including germanium. Its stoichiometry was reported as Li22Ge5 with F23 symmetry,[\cite=gladyshevskii:SPC:1964] due to its similarity to Li22Pb4. [\cite=zalkin:JPC:1958] More recently, Goward et al. [\cite=goward:JAC:2001] studied this family of structures and show that for the Ge, Sn and Pb compounds the correct stoichiometry is Li17Ge4 with [formula] symmetry. [formula] symmetry Li21Ge5, Li22Ge5 and Li17Ge4 are found by DFT all at local energy minima. However, Li17Ge4 is on the tie-line. Fassler et al. also predict a Li4.10Ge phase analogous to the Li4.11Si phase. We use the same model structures as in the Li4.11Si phase for our DFT calculations. These are above the tie-line as is expected for a high-temperature phase.

The Li-Ge system has an analogous inclination to forming Ge-Ge dumbbells as in Li-Si, as discussed in Sec. [\ref=dumbells].

Discussion

Crystal structures of the Li-Si and Li-Ge systems have been presented, found using both AIRSS searches and atomic species swapping of ICSD structures. Below we discuss the structures that are likely to be thermally accessible at room temperature, that is, those at a local minima on the DFT potential energy surface which reside on, or close to, the convex hull. These structures serve as a model for the clustering and bonding behavior of electrochemically lithiated silicon and germanium.[\cite=ogata:NC:2014]

The Li-Si system was used to validate our method: DFT finds all of the known phases as local energy minima including independently uncovering the Li17Si4 phase. For the Li-Ge system, DFT finds Li5Ge2, Li8Ge3, Li13Ge5 and Li13Ge4 locally stable and, to the best of our knowledge, these have not been presented in the literature before. DFT predicts that Li7Ge12 and Li11Ge6 are local energy minima; the former having Pc symmetry and the latter Cmcm. It was reported that Li11Ge6 may be produced from a high-temperature melt [\cite=frank:ZN:1975] but this has been disputed.[\cite=nesper:JSSC:1986] Also at local energy minima are the Li12Ge7 Pnma and Li7Ge3 P3212 phases, which were suggested by Grüttner [\cite=gruttner:ACA:1981] but without presenting the crystal structure. An unknown phase was found by heating ball milled Li-Ge, its XRD pattern fits an Li7Ge3 phase with [formula] symmetry. Since DFT and Grüttner both predict Li7Ge3 has P3212 symmetry, we propose that the unknown phase may be either the Li5Ge2 or Li8Ge3 phases which have a similar stoichiometry to Li7Ge3 and both of which DFT predicts to have [formula] symmetry.

For the Li-Si and Li-Ge structures on the tie-lines, the average voltages were calculated relative to lithium metal. This included for the first time Li17Si4 and Li1Si1. The average voltages are in good agreement with both previous calculations and experiment. They are higher in Li-Ge than Li-Si, implying that germanium has a lower energy density than silicon. However the higher insertion voltage is safer during lithiation, reducing the chance of lithium plating which can result in dendrites short circuiting the cell. Lithium in germanium also has higher diffusivity than in silicon.

Li1Si1 was previously only synthesisable at high pressure but has recently been synthesized by highly energetic ball milling, remotivating interest in the high-pressure phases. AIRSS searches predict a selection of higher energy Li1Si1 and Li1Ge1 phases. At lower pressures three-dimensional three-fold coordinated silicon/germanium networks were prevalent. However, at higher densities, both silicon and germanium exhibited a P4 / mmm structure comprising flat sheets of four-fold coordinated silicon and germanium atoms respectively. These became the most stable phase of Li1Si1 and Li1Ge1 at 2.5 GPa and 5 GPa respectively. Given the interest in silicene our layered compounds might provide an alternative route to layered silicon.

A LIB does not necessarily have time to equilibrate thermodynamically over large length scales. [\cite=key:JACS:2009] The ability to generate a wide range of locally-stable low-energy structures above the ground state allows us to visualize the types of clusters which form in the LIB during cycling. Over a lithiation range of LixSi, x = 2.33  -  3.25 we found that the structures present exhibited Si-Si dumbbells. At higher lithiation all of the silicon dumbbells break up and the crystalline Li15Si4 phase forms. Since these dumbbells were seen in both ground state and metastable phases is seems likely that they will exist in LIB anodes, probably in a lower symmetry solid solution. Furthermore we find the analogous dumbbell containing structures in the Li-Ge system.

Above we have demonstrated that the combination of both atomic species swapping the ICSD phases and AIRSS is a powerful tool for predicting the crystal structures of LIB electrode materials. A refinement to the method combines these two techniques by using results of the AIRSS searches as inputs to the species swapping technique. For example, the low-energy structures found by AIRSS in Li1Si1 were re-optimized as candidate Li1Ge1 phases in the Li-Ge system.

Our method has only provided results of the stable and metastable structures at 0 K, of course, the effect of temperature could be included post hoc using phonon calculations within the harmonic approximation and beyond. Our method serves as a crucial first step in ab initio materials discovery and design.
