Possible high temperature odd parity superconductivity in LaNi7 / 8Co1 / 8O3 (111) bilayers

Beside the well-known electron superconductivity caused by phonon-mediated attractive interactions[\cite=Cooper:2011p7868], Kohn and Luttinger showed[\cite=Kohn:1965p7867] that weak repulsive interactions can lead to superconductivity in Fermi liquids, albeit with low transition temperature. The discovery of high temperature superconductivity with d-wave pairing symmetry in copper-oxide compounds[\cite=Bednorz:1988p7869] [\cite=Tsuei:2000p7870] caused a revolution in quantum condensed matter physics and is a source of heated debate to date. However, it is broadly accepted that the strong repulsive Coulomb interaction-caused antiferromagnetic spin correlations play an important role for the superconducting pairing of electrons[\cite=Scalapino:2012p7871]. More recently, new excitement was caused by discovery of high temperature superconductivity in iron based pnictide compounds[\cite=Stewart:2011p7872] [\cite=Scalapino:2012p7871]. The parent compounds there are antiferromagnetically ordered too, but due to only moderate electron interactions are also metallic.

It has been proposed that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the iron pnictides drive the superconducting pairing, which has been demonstrated using various versions of renormalization group techiques[\cite=Shankar:1994p7862] [\cite=Polchinski:1984p7873] [\cite=Metzner:2012p7861] [\cite=Platt:2013p7896] in the intermediate coupling regime[\cite=3Wang:2009p5591] [\cite=Chubukov:2009p7882] [\cite=Chubukov:2008p7878] [\cite=4Platt:2009p7866] [\cite=Mazin:2008p7881]. In the past, similar theoretical methods were applied to the Hubbard model on the square lattice, which is relevant for the cuprate materials, and produced the correct d-wave pairing symmetry[\cite=Honerkamp:2001p5910] [\cite=Zanchi:2000p7874]. From this theoretical point of view, the antiferromagnetic instability at the bare level eventually contributes to the superconductivity scattering channels at lower energies during the renormalization steps. Comparing with the conventional Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity which occurs only at very low temperatures, this mechanism based on spin-density-wave(SDW) fluctuations could cause high temperature superconductivity.

Odd parity superconductors are interesting quantum states of matter which seized a lot of attention recently, partially due to potential applications in realizing Majorana fermions[\cite=Read:2000p5872] [\cite=Ivanov:2001p5868]. However, the known odd-parity superconductors, such as Sr2RuO4[\cite=Maeno:2012p7887] [\cite=MacKenzie:2003p7885] [\cite=Nelson:2004p7886], all have rather low transition temperatures, which presents experimental challenges to investigation of their fundamental properties, as well as to using them in various applications.

In this paper we point out that, analogous to the high temperature SDW-driven spin-singlet superconductivity, charge-density wave (CDW) fluctuations in a ferromagnetic metallic system can drive high temperature odd parity superconductivity. In addition, this mechanism is directly applicable to certain transition metal oxide heterostructures, which attracted much theoretical and experimental interest in the past decade[\cite=Hwang:2012p7889] [\cite=Okamoto:2013p7888] [\cite=1Xiao:2011p7761] as promising hosts for various strongly correlated electronic states. In particular, we expect that the CDW fluctutation driven odd parity superconductivity could occur in the LaNi1 - xCoxO3 bilayer grown in the (111) direction, with light cobalt doping of x = 1 / 8. Transition metal oxide heterstructures grown along the (111) direction have been proposed to host various topological phases[\cite=1Xiao:2011p7761] [\cite=2Yang:2011p6110] [\cite=Ruegg:2012p7890] [\cite=Ruegg:2011p6117]. Recently successful experimental synthesis of LaNiO3 (111) bilayers was reported[\cite=Middey:2012p7893]. A controllable doping by Co-atoms is expected to be achievable using the currently available experimental techniques.

As shown below, due to a partially filled near-flat band, the electronic structure of LaNi1 - xCoxO3 at x = 1 / 8 is expected to host a fully polarized hexagonal Fermi surface with nesting wavevectors. After ferromagnetism is developed, the leading remaining interaction is the on-site inter-orbital repulsion. Nested Fermi surface is well-known to have tendency towards CDW. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG) method, we demonstrate that the CDW fluctuations drive the SC instability, so that above a critical value of on-site inter-orbital repulsion, the CDW state gives way to a superconducting state which has odd symmetry (e.g., f-wave) since it pairs spin-polarized electrons. Here the FRG method is well suited for investigating electronic systems with intermediate repulsion strengths without any bias towards a particular instability.

Model. -- Our starting point is the model of LaNiO3 bilayer grown in the (111) direction, which has been described in detail in Refs.[\cite=1Xiao:2011p7761] [\cite=2Yang:2011p6110]. Fig. [\ref=fig1]a shows that the Ni atoms in the two layers form a honeycomb lattice so we use the two-dimensional description of the
