On the Riemann Hypothesis and the Difference Between Primes

Introduction

Much is already known on the interplay between the zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s) and the distribution of prime numbers; one can see Ingham's well-known text [\cite=inghambook] for more details. The Riemann hypothesis, which asserts that all of the non-trivial zeroes of ζ(s) have real part of 1 / 2, thus presents itself as an important problem in number theory.

On the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, von Koch [\cite=vonkoch] proved that there exists a constant k such that the interval [formula] contains a prime for all x  ≥  x0. Schoenfeld [\cite=schoenfeldjust] made this result precise, showing that one can take K  =  1 / (4π) and x0  =  599.

Cramér [\cite=cramer] improved the result of von Koch by proving the following theorem.

Suppose the Riemann hypothesis is true. Then it is possible to find a positive constant c such that

[formula]

for x  ≥  2. Thus if pn denotes the nth prime, we have

[formula]

Goldston [\cite=goldston] made this result more precise by showing that one could take c = 5 in the above theorem for all sufficiently large values of x. He also showed that

[formula]

for all sufficiently large values of n. It should be noted that Goldston was not trying in any way to find the optimal constants; he was providing a new proof of Cramér's theorem. Ramaré and Saouter [\cite=ramaresaouter] made this result explicit by showing that for all x  ≥  2 there exists a prime in the interval [formula].

The first purpose of this paper is to give the following improvement on the work of Ramaré and Saouter.

Suppose the Riemann hypothesis is true. Then there is a prime in the interval [formula] for all x  ≥  2.

We prove this theorem using a weighted version of the Riemann von-Mangoldt explicit formula and some standard explicit estimates for sums over the zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function. It should be noted that the constant 4 / π appearing in the above theorem is not optimal. The question of the optimal constant in Theorem [\ref=one] is thus an open problem. To this end, we prove the following theorem.

Suppose the Riemann hypothesis is true and let ε  >  0. Then there is a prime in the interval [formula] for all sufficiently large values of x.

It is not clear to the author whether the optimal constant is 1 or something smaller. The reader may wish to see the work of Goldston and Heath-Brown [\cite=goldstonheathbrown], for they show that one has an arbitrarily small constant on some more sophisticated conjectures.

From our proof of Theorem [\ref=implicit], it follows readily that Theorem [\ref=cramer] can be taken with c  =  3  +  ε for sufficiently large values of x. It is clear from the prime number theorem that c > 1.

Estimates on the Riemann hypothesis

A smooth explicit formula

The purpose of this section is to prove Theorem [\ref=one]. We define the von Mangoldt function as

and introduce the sum [formula]. This summatory function submits itself to the Riemann von-Mangoldt explicit formula

[formula]

where x > 0 is not an integer and the sum is over all nontrivial zeroes ρ  =  β + iγ of the Riemann zeta-function. We define the weighted sum

[formula]

and prove an analogous explicit formula.

For x > 0 and [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We integrate both sides of ([\ref=explicitoriginal]) over the interval (2,x) to get

[formula]

where

[formula]

The integral can be evaluated to yield log (16 / 27), and the sum over the zeroes can be estimated on the Riemann hypothesis by

[formula]

where the value of this sum is explicitly known (see, for example, Davenport [\cite=davenport]). The result follows.

We now consider the existence of prime numbers in an interval of the form (x - h,x + h). We do this by defining the weight function

and considering the identity

[formula]

One can verify this by expanding the weight sum on the left hand side. An application of Lemma [\ref=first] to the above equation gives us the following.

Let x > 0 and h > 0. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

We use this lemma to prove our results. Our concern is for estimating the sum Σ, which we consider in two parts:

[formula]

Here, Σ1 ranges over the zeroes ρ with |γ|  <  αx  /  h, where α > 0 is to be chosen later, and Σ2 is the contribution from the remaining zeroes.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=one]

For Σ1, we notice that the summand may be written as

[formula]

the absolute value of which can be bounded above by

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

where N(T) denotes the number of zeroes ρ with 0  <  β  <  1 and 0  <  γ  <  T. By Corollary 1 of Trudgian [\cite=trudgianargument], we have the bound

[formula]

for all T > 15, and so

[formula]

when αx / h  >  15. We can estimate Σ2 trivially on the Riemann hypothesis by

[formula]

where the last line follows from Lemma 1 (ii) of Skewes [\cite=skewes]. Putting our estimates for Σ1 and Σ2 into Lemma [\ref=dog] we have

[formula]

Notice that as we will choose h to be o(x), it follows that the term in front of the log  is asymptotic to

[formula]

It is a straightforward exercise in differential calculus to show that α  =  2 will minimise this term, and thus

[formula]

or rather

[formula]

The sum on the left hand side of the above inequality is over prime powers. As such we consider the Chebyshev θ-function given by

[formula]

Here we can use Theorem 14 and equation (5.5) of Schoenfeld [\cite=schoenfeld] to get that

[formula]

for all x  ≥  121. We use this bound with our inequality for ψ(x + h)  -  ψ(x - h) to get

[formula]

for this range of values. If we set [formula], the leading term on the right hand side can be shown to be asymptotic to

[formula]

Thus, for d  ≥  2 / π we have that there is a prime in the interval

[formula]

and so we choose d  =  2 / π. Then, using a monotonicity argument we have this for all x  ≥  65000. Replacing [formula] with x, we have that there is a prime in the interval

[formula]

for all

[formula]

where 2d  =  4 / π. This completes the proof of Theorem 2, for one can use Mathematica to verify the theorem for the remaining values of x.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=implicit]

In what follows we show that the constant 4 / π can be reduced to essentially 1 by a more detailed analysis of the sum Σ1. Bounding trivially, we have that

[formula]

By noting the straightforward bound

[formula]

which holds for h  =  o(x), we have that

[formula]

as |γ|  <  αx / h. Using this estimate and

[formula]

one obtains

This sum can be estimated using Theorem A from Ingham [\cite=inghambook] and equation ([\ref=boundcount]) to get that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the least positive ordinate of a zero. Employing the substitution u = 2xt / h and simplifying gives us that

[formula]

Now, estimating Σ2 as in the previous section, we have from Lemma [\ref=dog] and the above estimate for Σ1 that

[formula]

If we set [formula], and choose

[formula]

then it follows that

[formula]

We note that we have c  =  1 / 2  +  ε provided that we take α to be sufficiently large. One can also remove the contribution of prime powers to the sum to have that there is a prime in the interval

[formula]

for all sufficiently large values of x. This effectively completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=implicit].

A constant for Cramér's theorem

As mentioned in the introduction, one can also show that Theorem [\ref=cramer] can be taken with c = 3 + ε provided that x is sufficiently large. For if we take

[formula]

then we have, again removing the contribution from prime powers, that

[formula]

It remains to estimate by

[formula]

and the result follows.
