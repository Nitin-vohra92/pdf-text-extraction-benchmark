Introduction

Given a set X, a collection F  ⊆  P(X) is a Sperner system or an antichain if there do not exist A,B∈F such that [formula]. More generally, a collection F  ⊆  P(X) is a k-Sperner system if there does not exist a subcollection [formula] such that [formula]. Such a subcollection [formula] is called a (k + 1)-chain. We say that a k-Sperner system is saturated if, for every [formula], we have that [formula] contains a (k + 1)-chain. A collection F  ⊆  P(X) is an oversaturated k-Sperner system if, for every [formula], we have that the number of (k + 1)-chains in [formula] is greater than the number of (k + 1)-chains in F. Thus, F  ⊆  P(X) is a saturated k-Sperner system if and only if it is an oversaturated k-Sperner system that does not contain a (k + 1)-chain.

For a set X of cardinality n, the problem of determining the maximum size of a saturated k-Sperner system in P(X) is well understood. In the case k = 1, Sperner's Theorem [\cite=Sperner] (see also [\cite=WhiteBook]), says that every antichain in P(X) contains at most [formula] elements, and this bound is attained by the collection consisting of all subsets of X with cardinality [formula]. Erds [\cite=LittlewoodOfford] generalised Sperner's Theorem by proving that the largest size of a k-Sperner system in P(X) is the sum of the k largest binomial coefficients [formula]. In this paper, we are interested in determining the minimum size of a saturated k-Sperner system or an oversaturated k-Sperner system in P(X). These problems were first studied by Gerbner, Keszegh, Lemons, Palmer, Pálvölgyi and Patkós [\cite=gerb].

Given integers n and k, let [formula] denote the minimum size of a saturated k-Sperner system in P(X) where |X| = n. It was shown in [\cite=gerb] that [formula] if n and m are sufficiently large with respect to k. We can therefore define

[formula]

We are motivated by the following conjecture of [\cite=gerb].

For all k, [formula].

Gerbner et al. [\cite=gerb] observed that their conjecture is true for k = 1,2,3. They also proved that [formula] for all k, where the upper bound is implied by the following construction.

In this paper, we disprove Conjecture [\ref=mainconj] by establishing the following:

There exists ε > 0 such that, for all k, [formula].

We remark that the value of ε that can be deduced from our proof is approximately [formula]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=epsilon] comes in two parts. First, we give an infinite family of saturated 6-Sperner systems of cardinality 30 which shows that [formula]. We then provide a method which, under certain conditions, allows us to combine a saturated k1-Sperner system of small order and a saturated k2-Sperner system of small order to obtain a saturated (k1 + k2 - 2)-Sperner system of small order. By repeatedly applying this method, we are able to prove Theorem [\ref=epsilon] for general k. As it turns out, our method yields the bound [formula] for every [formula]. For completeness, we will prove that [formula] for k  ≤  5, and so k = 6 is the first value of k for which Conjecture [\ref=mainconj] is false.

Similar techniques show that [formula] satisfies a submultiplicativity condition, which leads to the following result.

For ε as in Theorem [\ref=epsilon], there exists c∈[1  /  2,1  -  ε] such that [formula].

Naturally, we wonder about the correct value of c in Theorem [\ref=submult].

Determine the constant c for which [formula].

We are also interested in oversaturated k-Sperner systems. Given integers n and k, let [formula] denote the minimum size of an oversaturated k-Sperner system in P(X) where |X| = n. As we will prove in Lemma [\ref=satk], [formula] provided that n and m are sufficiently large with respect to k. Similarly to [formula], we define [formula]. Gerbner et al. [\cite=gerb] proved that if |X|  ≥  k, then an oversaturated k-Sperner system in P(X) of minimum size has between 2k / 2  -  1 and [formula] elements. Together with Lemma [\ref=satk], this implies

[formula]

We show that the lower bound gives the correct asymptotic behaviour, up to a polynomial factor.

For every integer k and set X with |X|  ≥  k2 + k there exists an oversaturated k-Sperner system F  ⊆  P(X) such that [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

In Section [\ref=prelims], we prove some preliminary results which will be used throughout the paper. In particular, we provide conditions under which a saturated k-Sperner system can be decomposed into or constructed from a sequence of k disjoint saturated antichains. In Section [\ref=comb] we show that certain types of saturated k1-Sperner and k2-Sperner systems can be combined to produce a saturated (k1 + k2 - 2)-Sperner system, and use this to prove Theorems [\ref=epsilon] and [\ref=submult]. Finally, in Section [\ref=wsat], we give a probabilistic construction of oversaturated k-Sperner systems of small cardinality, thereby proving Theorem [\ref=wsatb].

Minimum saturation has been studied extensively in the context of graphs [\cite=completepartite] [\cite=BollobasEHM] [\cite=C5] [\cite=Kst] [\cite=hypercube] [\cite=KaszTuz] [\cite=C4] [\cite=Wessel] [\cite=Wessel2] and hypergraphs [\cite=runif] [\cite=OlegHyper2] [\cite=rstars] [\cite=OlegHyper]. Such problems are typically of the following form: for a fixed (hyper)graph H, determine the minimum size of a (hyper)graph G on n vertices which does not contain a copy of H and for which adding any edge e∉G, yields a (hyper)graph which contains a copy of H. This line of research was first initiated by Zykov [\cite=Zykov] and Erds, Hajnal and Moon [\cite=EHM]. For more background on minimum saturation problems for graphs, we refer the reader to the survey of Faudree, Faudree and Schmitt [\cite=satsurvey].

Preliminaries

Given a collection F  ⊆  P(X), we say that a set A  ⊆  X is an atom for F if A is maximal with respect to the property that

[formula]

We say that an atom A with [formula] is homogeneous for F. Gerbner et al. [\cite=gerb] proved that if n,m are sufficiently large with respect to k, then [formula]. Using a similar approach, we extend this result to [formula].

Fix k. If n,m > 22k - 1, then [formula] and [formula].

Fix n > 22k - 1 and let X be a set of cardinality n. Suppose that F  ⊆  P(X) is an oversaturated k-Sperner system of cardinality at most 2k - 1. We know that such a family exists by Construction [\ref=powerset]. We will show that, for sets X1 and X2 such that |X1| = n - 1 and |X2| = n + 1, there exists F1  ⊆  P(X1) and F2  ⊆  P(X2) such that

|F1| = |F2| = |F|,

F1 and F2 have the same number of (k + 1)-chains as F,

F1 and F2 are oversaturated k-Sperner systems.

We observe that this is enough to prove the lemma. Indeed, by taking F to be a saturated k-Sperner system or an oversaturated k-Sperner system in P(X) of minimum order, we will have that

[formula]

[formula]

Since n was an arbitrary integer greater than 22k - 1, the result will follow by induction.

We prove the following claim.

Given a set X and a collection F  ⊆  P(X), if |X| > 2|F|, then there is a homogeneous set for F.

We observe that every atom A for F corresponds to a subcollection FA: = {S∈F:A  ⊆  S} of F such that FA  ≠  FA' whenever A  ≠  A'. This implies that the number of atoms for F is at most 2|F|. Therefore, since |X| > 2|F|, there must be a homogeneous set H for F.

By Claim [\ref=bighom] and the fact that [formula], there exists a homogeneous set H for F. Let x1∈H and x2∉X and define [formula] and [formula]. Let

[formula]

[formula]

Since H is homogeneous for F, there does not exist a pair of sets in F which differ only on x1. Thus, for i∈{1,2} there is a natural bijection from Fi to F which preserves set inclusion. Hence, ([\ref=samecard]) and ([\ref=samechains]) hold. Now, let i∈{1,2} and [formula] and define

[formula]

Then [formula] since H is a non-singleton atom and [formula], and so there exists [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

Since [formula], we must have [formula] for j  ≤  t and so [formula] and [formula]. Also, since [formula], we have [formula] for j  ≥  t + 1. Setting [formula], we see that Aj'∈Fi for j  ≥  t + 1 and that [formula]. Thus, ([\ref=stillwsat]) holds.

The rest of the results of this section are concerned with the structure of saturated k-Sperner systems. The next lemma, which is proved in [\cite=gerb], implies that for any saturated k-Sperner system there can be at most one homogeneous set. We include a proof for completeness.

If F  ⊆  P(X) is a saturated k-Sperner system and H1 and H2 are homogeneous for F, then H1 = H2.

Suppose to the contrary that H1 and H2 are homogeneous for F and that H1  ≠  H2. Then, since each of H1 and H2 are maximal with respect to ([\ref=hom]), we have that [formula] is not homogeneous for F. Therefore, there is a set S∈F which contains some, but not all, of [formula]. Without loss of generality, we have [formula] and [formula] since H1 and H2 are homogeneous for F. Now, pick x∈H1 and y∈H2 arbitrarily and define

[formula]

Clearly T cannot be in F since [formula] and H1 is homogeneous for F. Since F is saturated, there must exist sets [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

Since H1 and H2 are homogeneous for F, and neither H1 nor H2 is contained in T, we get that [formula]. Similarly, [formula]. However, this implies that [formula] is a (k + 1)-chain in F, a contradiction.

By Lemma [\ref=block], if F is a saturated k-Sperner system for which there exists a homogeneous set, then the homogeneous set must be unique. Throughout the paper, it will be useful to distinguish the elements of F which contain the homogeneous set from those that do not.

Let F  ⊆  P(X) be a saturated k-Sperner system and let H be homogeneous for F. We say that a set S∈F is large if H  ⊆  S or small if [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] denote the collection of large and small sets of F, respectively. Thus, [formula].

Let A  ⊆  P(X) be a saturated antichain with homogeneous set H. Then every set [formula] either contains a set in [formula] or is contained in a set of [formula].

Suppose, to the contrary, that [formula] does not contain a set of [formula] and is not contained in a set of [formula]. Since A is saturated, we get that either

there exists [formula] such that [formula], or

there exists [formula] such that [formula].

Suppose that ([\ref=bigcont]) holds. Let [formula] and x∈H and define [formula]. Since H is homogeneous for A and [formula], we must have T∉A. Also, since H is homogeneous for A, any set T'∈A containing T would have to contain [formula]. Therefore, since A is an antichain, no such set T' can exist. Thus, there is a set T''∈A such that [formula]. Since H is homogeneous for A and [formula], we get that [formula], contradicting our assumption on S.

Note that we are also done in the case that ([\ref=smallcont]) holds by considering the saturated antichain [formula] and applying the argument of the previous paragraph.

Constructing and Decomposing Saturated -Sperner Systems

There is a natural way to partition a k-Sperner system F  ⊆  P(X) into a sequence of k pairwise disjoint antichains. Specifically, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, let Ai be the collection of all minimal elements of [formula] under inclusion. We say that [formula] is the canonical decomposition of F into antichains.

In this section we provide conditions under which a sequence of k pairwise disjoint saturated antichains can be united to obtain a saturated k-Sperner system. Later we will prove a partial converse: if F  ⊆  P(X) is a saturated k-Sperner system with a homogeneous set, then every antichain of the canonical decomposition of F is saturated. We also provide an example which shows that this is not necessarily the case if we remove the condition that F has a homogeneous set.

We say that a sequence (Di)ti = 0 of subsets of P(X) is layered if, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  t, every D∈Di strictly contains some D'∈Di - 1 as a subset.

Note that the canonical decomposition of any set system is layered.

If (Ai)ti = 0 is a layered sequence of pairwise disjoint saturated antichains, then every A∈Ai is strictly contained in some B∈Ai + 1

Let A∈Ai. Since Ai + 1 is a saturated antichain disjoint from Ai, there exists some B∈Ai + 1 such that either [formula] or [formula]. In the latter case we are done, so suppose [formula]. Since (Ai)ti = 0 is layered, there exists some A'∈Ai such that [formula]. Hence we have [formula], contradicting the fact that Ai is an antichain and completing the proof.

If (Ai)k - 1i = 0 is a layered sequence of pairwise disjoint saturated antichains in P(X), then [formula] is a saturated k-Sperner system.

Clearly, F is a k-Sperner system since [formula] are antichains. Let [formula] be arbitrary and define [formula]. If [formula], then S strictly contains some set At∈At. As (Ai)k - 1i = 0 is layered, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  t - 1, there exist sets Ai∈Ai such that

[formula]

Now, if t  ≥  k - 2, then since At + 1 is a saturated antichain and S does not contain a set of At + 1, there must exist At + 1∈At + 1 such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=up], we see that for t + 2  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 there exists Ai∈Ai such that

[formula]

Thus [formula] is a (k + 1)-chain, as desired.

In Lemma [\ref=cont], we require the sequence (Ai)k - 1i = 0 of saturated antichains to be layered. As it turns out, if each antichain Ai has a homogeneous set, then (Ai)k - 1i = 0 is layered if and only if [formula] is layered.

Let (Ai)k - 1i = 0 be a sequence of pairwise disjoint saturated antichains in P(X), each of which has a homogeneous set. Then (Ai)k - 1i = 0 is layered if and only if [formula] is layered.

Suppose that (Ai)k - 1i = 0 is layered and, for some [formula], let [formula] be arbitrary. We show that A contains a set of [formula]. Otherwise, since (Ai)k - 1i = 0 is layered, we get that there is some [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore, since Ai is an antichain, A cannot be contained in an element of [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=thisorthat] and the fact that Ai and Ai + 1 are disjoint, we get that A contains a set of [formula], as desired.

Now, suppose that [formula] is layered. Given [formula] and [formula], we show that S contains a set of Ai, which will complete the proof. If not, then since Ai is saturated and disjoint from Ai + 1, there must exist T∈Ai such that [formula]. Since Ai + 1 is an antichain, S cannot be strictly contained in a set of [formula], and so neither can T. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=thisorthat], there is a set [formula] contained in T. However, since [formula] is layered, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. But then, [formula], which contradicts the assumption that Ai is an antichain. The result follows.

It is natural to wonder whether a converse to Lemma [\ref=cont] is true. That is: if F is a saturated k-Sperner system, can we decompose F into a layered sequence of k pairwise disjoint saturated antichains? The following example shows that this is not always the case.

Let X: = {x1,x2,x3}, Y: = {y1,y2,y3} and [formula]. We define

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then [formula] is a layered sequence of disjoint antichains. In fact, [formula] is the canonical decomposition of [formula]. Clearly B1 is not saturated as [formula] is an antichain. We claim that F is a saturated 2-Sperner system.

Consider any [formula]. We will show that [formula] contains a 3-chain. It is easy to check that every element of [formula] is contained in a set of B1. Hence if S is contained in some set [formula], then [formula] contains a 3-chain. In particular, this completes the proof when |S|∈{0,1,2}. Similarly, since [formula] is layered, if S contains some set B∈B1, then [formula] contains a 3-chain. Therefore, we are done if |S|∈{4,5,6}.

It remains to consider the case that |S|  =  3. Since X,Y∈F, we must have [formula], or [formula]. If [formula], we have S∈{{x1,y1,y2},{x2,y2,y3},{x3,y1,y3}}. This implies that S is contained in a set B∈B1 and contains a set [formula]. If [formula], then S contains some set {xi,xj}∈B0. Also, it is easily verified that S is contained in a set of B1. Thus, F is a saturated 2-Sperner system.

However, for saturated k-Sperner systems with a homogeneous set, the converse to Lemma [\ref=cont] does hold; we can partition F into a layered sequence of k pairwise disjoint saturated antichains.

Let F∈P(X) be a saturated k-Sperner system with homogeneous set H and canonical decomposition [formula]. Then Ai is saturated for all i.

Fix i and let [formula]. Let x∈H and define

[formula]

Then T∉F since [formula] and H is homogeneous for F. Therefore, there exists [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

By definition of the canonical decomposition, we must have Aj∈Aj for all j. Also, since H is homogeneous for F and [formula], we must have [formula] and [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Since S  ≠  Ai, we must have either [formula] or [formula] depending on whether or not i < t. Therefore, Ai is saturated for all i.

Combining Saturated -Sperner Systems

Our first goal in this section is to prove that, under certain conditions, a saturated k1-Sperner system F1  ⊆  P(X1) and a saturated k2-Sperner system F2  ⊆  P(X2) can be combined to yield a saturated (k1 + k2 - 2)-Sperner system in [formula]. We apply this result to prove Theorem [\ref=epsilon]. Afterwards, we prove that [formula] for k  ≤  5. We conclude the section with a proof of Theorem [\ref=submult].

Let X1 and X2 be disjoint sets. For i∈{1,2}, let Fi  ⊆  P(Xi) be a saturated ki-Sperner system which contains [formula] and let Hi  ⊆  Xi be homogeneous for Fi. If G is the set system on [formula] defined by

[formula]

then G is a saturated (k1 + k2 - 2)-Sperner system which contains [formula] and [formula] is homogeneous for G.

It is clear that G contains [formula] and that [formula] is homogeneous for G. We show that G is a saturated (k1 + k2 - 2)-Sperner system.

First, let us show that G does not contain a chain of length k1 + k2 - 1. Suppose that [formula] is an r-chain in G. We can assume that [formula] and [formula]. Define

[formula]

[formula]

Clearly, [formula]. Also, for i∈{1,2}, since Fi is a ki-Sperner system, we must have |Ii|  ≤  ki - 1. Let t be the maximum index such that [formula]. Note that t exists and is less than r since [formula] and [formula]. By construction of G, [formula] is a small set for F2 and, for i∈{1,2}, [formula] is a large set for Fi. This implies that [formula] and so

[formula]

as required.

Now, let [formula]. We show that [formula] contains a (k1 + k2 - 1)-chain. Fix x1∈H1 and x2∈H2 and define

[formula]

For i∈{1,2}, let [formula]. Then Ti∉Fi since [formula]. Therefore, there exists [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

Note that [formula] for j  ≤  ti and [formula] for j  ≥  ti + 1. This implies that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

[formula]

and so [formula] contains a (k1 + k2 - 1)-chain. The result follows.

If F1, F2 and G are as in Lemma [\ref=comblem], then

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=epsilon]

We apply Lemma [\ref=comblem] to prove Theorem [\ref=epsilon]. The first part of the proof of Theorem [\ref=epsilon] is to exhibit an infinite family of saturated 6-Sperner systems with cardinality 30 < 25.

For any set X such that |X|  ≥  8, there is a saturated 6-Sperner system F  ⊆  P(X) with a homogeneous set such that [formula].

Let X be a set such that [formula]. Let x1,x2,y1,y2,w and z be distinct elements of X and define [formula]. We apply Lemma [\ref=cont] to construct a saturated 6-Sperner system F  ⊆  P(X) of order 30. Naturally, we define [formula] and A5: = {X}. Also, define

[formula]

[formula]

It is easily observed that A1 and A4 are saturated antichains. We define A2 and A3 by first specifying their small sets. Define

[formula]

[formula]

Given any collection B  ⊆  P(X), a set S  ⊆  X is said to be stable for B if S does not contain an element of B. For i = 2,3, define [formula] to be the collection consisting of all maximal stable sets of [formula] and let [formula]. Note that every element of [formula] contains H. It is clear that Ai is an antichain for i = 2,3. Moreover, Ai is saturated since every set A∈P(X) either contains an element of [formula] or is contained in an element of [formula].

One can easily verify that [formula] is layered. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=layer], [formula] is a layered sequence of pairwise disjoint saturated antichains. By Lemma [\ref=cont], [formula] is a saturated 6-Sperner system. Also,

[formula]

[formula]

as desired.

We remark that the construction in Proposition [\ref=k=6] is similar to one which was used in [\cite=gerb] to prove that [formula] for every [formula].

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=epsilon] we require that

[formula]

This was proved in [\cite=gerb] using the fact that if F  ⊆  P(X) is a saturated (k - 1)-Sperner system and y∉X, then [formula] is a saturated k-Sperner system in [formula].

First, we prove that the result holds when k is of the form 4j + 2 for some [formula]. In this case, we repeatedly apply Lemma [\ref=comblem] and Proposition [\ref=k=6] to obtain a saturated k-Sperner system F on an arbitrarily large ground set X such that

[formula]

Therefore, if k = 4j  +  2, then [formula].

For k of the form 4j + 2 + s for [formula] and 1  ≤  s  ≤  3, apply ([\ref=2sat]) to obtain [formula]. Thus, we are done by setting ε slightly smaller than [formula].

Bounding From Below

One can easily deduce from the proof of Theorem [\ref=epsilon] that [formula] for all k  ≥  6. For completeness, we prove that [formula] for k  ≤  5.

If k  ≤  5, then [formula].

Fix k  ≤  5. The upper bound follows from Construction [\ref=powerset], and so it suffices to prove that [formula]. Let X be a set with n: = |X| > 22k - 1 and let F  ⊆  P(X) be a saturated k-Sperner system of minimum order. By Claim [\ref=bighom] and the fact that [formula], there is a homogeneous set H for F.

Let [formula] be the canonical decomposition of F. By Lemma [\ref=satur], we get that Ai is a saturated antichain for each i. Also, since [formula] is layered, by Lemma [\ref=up] we see that

[formula]

Our goal is to to show that for [formula], every saturated antichain Ai which satisfies ([\ref=between]) must contain at least [formula] elements. Clearly this is enough to complete the proof of the proposition. Note that it suffices to prove this for [formula] since [formula] is a saturated antichain in which every set has size between k - i - 1 and n - i. Since [formula], this means that we need only check the cases i = 0,1,2. In the case i = 0, we obtain [formula] trivially.

Next, consider the case i = 1. Let A be the largest set in A1 such that H  ⊆  A. Then, by ([\ref=between]), we must have |A|  ≤  n - k + 2 and so [formula]. Fix an element x of H and, for each [formula], define [formula]. Since A1 is saturated, H is homogeneous for F, and A is the largest set in A1 containing H, there must be a set By∈A1 such that [formula]. However, since A1 is an antichain, [formula], and so [formula]. In particular, By  ≠  By' for y  ≠  y'. Therefore, [formula], as desired.

Thus, we are finished except for the case i = 2 and k = 5. Suppose to the contrary that [formula]. We begin by proving the following claim.

For every vertex [formula], there is a set [formula] containing y.

Let x∈H be arbitrary and consider the set T: = {x,y}. Then T is not contained in A2 since H is homogeneous for F. Also, no strict subset of T is in A2 by ([\ref=between]). Since A2 is saturated, there must be some [formula] containing T, which completes the proof.

Let us argue that [formula]. By ([\ref=between]), each set [formula] has at most n - 2 elements. So, by Claim [\ref=conty], if [formula], then it must be the case that [formula] where [formula]. Therefore, since each of |A1| and |A2| is at most n - 2, we can pick [formula] and [formula]. Given x∈H and 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  2, we have that {x,wi,zj}∉A2 since H is homogeneous for F. Note that {x,wi,zj} is not contained in either A1 or A2, and so by Lemma [\ref=thisorthat] and ([\ref=between]) we must have {wi,zj}∈A2. However, this implies that [formula], a contradiction.

So, we get that [formula]. Note that [formula] is also a saturated antichain in which every set has cardinality between 2 and n - 2. Thus, we can apply the argument of the previous paragraph to obtain [formula]. Therefore, [formula], which completes the proof.

It is possible that a similar approach may prove fruitful for improving the lower bound on [formula] from 2k / 2 - 1 to 2(1 + o(1))ck for some c > 1 / 2. That is, one may first decompose a saturated k-Sperner system F  ⊆  P(X) of minimum size into its canonical decomposition [formula] and then bound the size of |Ai| for each i individually. Since there are only k antichains in the decomposition and the bound on |F| that we are aiming for is exponential in k, one could obtain a fairly tight lower bound on [formula] by focusing on a single antichain of the decomposition. Setting [formula] in ([\ref=between]), we see that it would be sufficient to prove that there exists c > 1 / 2 such that every saturated antichain A with a homogeneous set such that every element of A has cardinality between [formula] and [formula] must satisfy |A|  ≥  2(1 + o(1))ck. The problem of determining whether such a c exists is interesting in its own right.

Asymptotic Behaviour of

To prove Theorem [\ref=submult], we require the following fact, which is proved in [\cite=gerb].

For any [formula] and set X with |X| = n there is a saturated k-Sperner system F  ⊆  P(X) such that [formula] and [formula].

Let F  ⊆  P(X) be a saturated k-Sperner system such that [formula]. We let [formula] denote the canonical decomposition of F and define

[formula]

It is clear that F'  ⊆  P(X) is a saturated k-Sperner system and [formula], which proves the result.

We show that, for all [formula],

[formula]

Letting [formula], we see that ([\ref=4sat]) implies that [formula] for every [formula]. It follows by Fekete's Lemma that f(k)1 / k converges, and so [formula] converges as well.

For [formula], let X and Y be disjoint sets of size n and let Fk  ⊆  P(X) and [formula] be saturated k-Sperner and [formula]-Sperner systems of cardinalities [formula] and [formula], respectively. By Claim [\ref=bighom], we can assume that Fk and [formula] have homogeneous sets and, by Lemma [\ref=emptyfull], we can assume that [formula] and [formula]. We apply Lemma [\ref=comblem] and Remark [\ref=sizes] to obtain a saturated [formula]-Sperner system [formula] of order at most [formula]. Therefore, by ([\ref=2sat]), we have

[formula]

as required.

Oversaturated -Sperner Systems

In this section we construct oversaturated k-Sperner systems of small order. We first state a lemma, from which Theorem [\ref=wsatb] follows, and then prove the lemma itself.

Given k  ≥  1, let X be a set of cardinality k2  +  k. Then for all t such that 1  ≤  t  ≤  k2 + k there exist non-empty collections Ft, Gt  ⊆  P(X) that have the following properties:

For every F∈Ft and G∈Gt, |F|  +  |G|  ≥  k,

[formula],

For every S  ⊆  X such that |S| = t, there exists some F∈Ft and some G∈Gt such that [formula] and [formula].

We apply Lemma [\ref=fun] to prove Theorem [\ref=wsatb].

First, let X be a set of cardinality k2 + k. For [formula], let Ft and Gt be as in Lemma [\ref=fun]. For each [formula], choose [formula] such that

[formula]

where i: =  min {k - 1,|F|}. We let [formula] and define

[formula]

For each t  ≤  k2 + k and [formula], we have |CF|  ≤  k. Thus, by Property ([\ref=nottoomany]) of Lemma [\ref=fun],

[formula]

We will now show that for any [formula] there is a (k + 1)-chain in [formula] containing S, which will imply that G is an oversaturated k-Sperner system. Let S  ⊆  X and define t: = |S|. By Property ([\ref=contained]) of Lemma [\ref=fun], there exists F∈Ft such that [formula] and G∈Gt such that [formula]. This implies that [formula]. By Property ([\ref=sumk]) of Lemma [\ref=fun] we get that

[formula]

contains a (k + 1)-chain in [formula] containing S.

Now, suppose that |X| > k2 + k. Let Y  ⊆  X such that |Y| = k2 + k and define [formula]. As above, let G  ⊆  P(Y) be an oversaturated k-Sperner system of cardinality at most [formula]. Define   ⊆  P(X) as follows:

[formula]

Consider any set [formula]. Let [formula]. We have, by definition of G, that there is a (k + 1)-chain C in [formula] containing S'. Adding H to every superset of S' in C and replacing S' by S in C gives us a (k + 1)-chain in [formula] containing S. The result follows.

To prove Lemma [\ref=fun], we use a probabilistic approach.

Throughout the proof, we assume that k is sufficiently large and let X be a set of cardinality k2 + k. Let 1  ≤  t  ≤  k2 + k be given. We can assume that [formula] since, otherwise, we can simply define Ft: = Gk2 + k - t and Gt: = Fk2 + k - t. We divide the proof into two cases depending on the size of t.

We define [formula] and let Gt be a uniformly random collection of 2k / 2 subsets of X, each of cardinality k. Given S  ⊆  X of cardinality t, the probability that S is not disjoint from any set of Gt is

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, the expected number of subsets of X of cardinality t which are not disjoint from any set of Gt is at most [formula], which is less than 1. Thus, with non-zero probability, every S  ⊆  X of cardinality t is disjoint from some set in Gt.

Define [formula] and let a be the rational number such that [formula]. Then, since [formula], we have

[formula]

Now, let Ft be a collection of [formula] subsets of X, each of cardinality ak, chosen uniformly at random with replacement. Similarly, let Gt be a collection of [formula] subsets of X, each of cardinality (1 - a)k, chosen uniformly at random with replacement. We show that, with non-zero probability, every S  ⊆  X of size t contains a set of Ft and is disjoint from a set of Gt.

Given S  ⊆  X of size t = p(k2 + k), the probability that S does not contain a set of Ft is at most

[formula]

[formula]

Observe that [formula] for large enough k. So, [formula] which is at least e- 8 since a < 4 / 7 and p  ≥  1 / 8. Thus, the expression in ([\ref=pk]) is at most

[formula]

Using our choice of a and the fact that p  ≥  1 / 8, we can bound the exponent by

[formula]

Therefore, the expected number of subsets of X of size t which do not contain a set of Ft is at most

[formula]

which is less than 1. Thus, with positive probability, every subset of X of cardinality t contains a set of Ft.

The proof that, with positive probability, every set of cardinality t is disjoint from a set of Gt is similar; we sketch the details. First, let us note that

[formula]

since p  ≤  1 / 2. For a fixed set S  ⊆  X of size t = p(k2 + k), the probability that S is not disjoint from any set of Gt is at most

[formula]

[formula]

Now, [formula] for large enough k. So, [formula], which is at least e- 2 since a  ≥  1 / 6 and [formula]. Therefore, the expression in ([\ref=Gtbound]) is at most

[formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=abound]), we can bound the exponent by

[formula]

As with Ft, we get that the expected number of sets of cardinality t which are not disjoint from a set of Gt is less than one. The result follows.
