[formula] restoration via increased loss-gain in [formula]-symmetric Aubry-Andre model

Introduction. Open systems with balanced loss and gain have gained tremendous interest in the past three years since their experimental realizations in optical [\cite=expt1] [\cite=expt2] [\cite=expt3] [\cite=expt4], electrical [\cite=rc], and mechanical [\cite=pendulum] systems. Such systems are described by non-hermitian Hamiltonians that are invariant under combined parity and time-reversal ([formula]) operations [\cite=bender3]. Apart from their mathematical appeal, such non-hermitian Hamiltonians show non-intuitive properties such as unidirectional invisibility [\cite=expt4] [\cite=uni1] [\cite=uni2] and are thus of potential technological importance.

Historically, [formula] Hamiltonians on an infinite line were the first to be investigated [\cite=bender1] [\cite=bender2]. The range of parameters where the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is purely real, ελ  =  ε*λ, and the eigenfunctions are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the [formula] operator, ψλ(x) = ψ*λ( - x), is called the [formula]-symmetric phase. The emergence of complex conjugate eigenvalues when the parameters are not in this region is called [formula]-symmetry breaking. A positive threshold for [formula]-symmetry breaking implies that the system transitions [\cite=expt2] [\cite=expt3] [\cite=expt4] [\cite=rc] [\cite=pendulum] from a quasi-equilibrium state at a small but nonzero non-hermiticity, to loss of reciprocity as the strength of the balanced loss-gain term crosses the threshold. Although [formula]-symmetric Hamiltonian studies started with continuum Hamiltonians, all of their realizations are in finite lattices where the continuum, effective-mass approximation may not apply. This observation has led to tremendous interest in [formula]-symmetric lattice models [\cite=znojil1] [\cite=znojil2] [\cite=bendix] [\cite=song] [\cite=avadh] [\cite=longhi1] [\cite=longhi2] that can be realized in coupled waveguide arrays [\cite=review1] [\cite=review2].

A universal feature of all such systems is that [formula]-symmetry is broken by increasing the balanced loss-gain strength and restored by reducing it. Here, we present a tight-binding model that can exhibit exactly opposite behavior, via a family of [formula]-symmetric, periodic potentials.

A remarkable property of lattice models, absent in the continuum limit, is the effects of a periodic potential. The spectrum of a charged particle in constant magnetic field in two dimensions consists of Landau levels [\cite=ll] [\cite=graphene1] [\cite=graphene2]; a similar particle on a two-dimensional lattice displays a fractal, Hofstadter butterfly spectrum [\cite=harper] [\cite=butterfly] [\cite=ca] [\cite=graph]. In one dimensional lattices, a fractal spectrum emerges in the presence of a hermitian, periodic potential, and this model, known as the Aubry-Andre model [\cite=aa], shows localization transition in a clean system when the strength of the incommensurate potential exceeds the nearest-neighbor hopping [\cite=lahini]. Here, we consider a [formula]-symmetric Aubry-Andre model on an N-site lattice with hopping J and complex potential [formula] where nc = (N + 1) / 2 is the lattice center and γ > 0. Since Vβ = ( - 1)2ncV*1 - β = ( - 1)2ncV1 + β, it is sufficient to consider the family of potentials with 0 < β  <  1 (when β = 0 the problem reduces to the Aubrey-Andre model [\cite=harper] [\cite=aa]). We then consider the effect of two such potentials Vβ1 + Vβ2 with |β1  -  β2|  ~  1 / N  ≪  1.

Our salient results are follows: i) For a single potential Vβ, the threshold loss-gain strength γPT(N,V0,β) shows N local maxima along the β axis; it is suppressed by a nonzero real modulation V0. ii) The discrete index of pair of eigenvalues that become complex can be tuned stepwise by varying 0 < β  <  1 / 2. iii) For V = Vβ1 + Vβ2, generically, the phase diagram in the (γ1,γ2) plane shows a re-entrant [formula]-symmetric phase: a broken [formula]-symmetry is restored by increasing the non-hermiticity and broken again when γi become sufficiently large. This behavior is absent in the extensively studied continuum Hamiltonians with complex potentials [\cite=makrispt] [\cite=longpt] [\cite=graefept], and is a result of competition between the two lattice potentials Vβ1 and Vβ2.

We emphasize that γi > 0 means the gain-regions of the two potentials mostly align as do their respective loss-regions. Thus, the competition between Vβ1 and Vβ2  ≈  β1 is not in their loss-gain profiles, but, as we will show below, due to the relative locations of [formula]-symmetry breaking energy-levels in the spectrum.

[formula] phase diagram for a single potential. The tight-binding hopping Hamiltonian for an N-site lattice with open boundary conditions is [formula]. Its particle-hole symmetric energy spectrum is given by ε0,p =  - 2J cos (kp) =  - ε0, and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are [formula] where 0 < kp = pπ / (N + 1) < π and  = N + 1 - p. The properties that relate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions at indices p, remain valid in the presence of pure loss-gain potential Vβ =  - V*β [\cite=ph]. The eigenvalue equation for an eigenfunction f(n) of the non-Hermitian, [formula]-symmetric Hamiltonian Hβ = H0 + Vβ is given by (1  ≤  n  ≤  N)

[formula]

with f(0) = 0 = f(N + 1). Since this difference equation is not analytically soluble for an arbitrary β, we numerically obtain the spectrum E(γ) and the [formula]-symmetry breaking threshold γPT(N,V0,β) using different discretizations βk = kδβ along the β-axis. Due to the β  ↔  1 - β symmetry of the potential, it follows that the exact threshold loss-gain strength satisfies γPT(N,V0,β) = γPT(N,V0,1 - β) = γPT(N, - V0,β).

We consider a purely loss-gain potential, present results for an even lattice, and point out the salient differences that arise when lattice size N is odd or when V0  ≠  0. The left-hand panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:phasediagram] shows the [formula]-symmetric threshold γPT(N,β) / J for an N = 50 lattice obtained by using discretization δβ = 1 / 2N (blue squares), an N = 100 lattice with δβ = 1 / 4N (red markers), and an N = 400 lattice with δβ = 1 / N (black stars). There is a monotonic suppression of the threshold strength with increasing N, and, crucially, the general shape of the phase diagram depends upon the size of δβ relative to 1 / N. A scaling of this threshold suppression for lattice sizes N = 50 - 500, shown in the inset, implies that γPT(N,β) = Cβ / N where Cβ is a constant. Thus, the threshold strength is suppressed linearly and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit [\cite=mark] [\cite=dima]. However, this algebraically fragile nature of the [formula]-phase is not an impediment since [formula]-systems to-date are only realized in small lattices with N  ≪  100. The right-hand panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:phasediagram] shows the phase diagram for N = 50 case with discretization δβ = 1 / N2. The results for irrational values of β and other discretizations lie on the same curve. The [formula] phase diagram shows (N - 2) local maxima located at βk = (2k + 1) / 2N and the two maxima at the end points, is symmetric about the center and has a local minimum in the threshold at β = 1 / 2. In addition, the function γPT(N,β) has (N - 1) minima at βk = k / N and smoothly oscillates over a period [formula] as shown in the inset (solid red circles). These results are generic for any lattice size N with discretization δβ  ~  1 / N2.

When N is odd, the non-Hermitian potential vanishes at β = 1 / 2 and the spectrum of the Hamiltonian Hβ is purely real. For an odd lattice, a similarly obtained phase diagram shows (N - 1) local maxima that are distributed equally on the two sides of β = 1 / 2, along with a substantial enhancement in the threshold strength as β  →  1 / 2±. Adding a real potential modulation V0  ≠  0, to the loss-gain potential, in general, suppresses the threshold strength.

The phase diagram can be understood as follows: for a small β  ~  1 / N2  ≪  1 / N, Vβ(n) = iγ(2πβ)(n - nc) and the enhanced [formula]-breaking threshold, γPT / J  ~  0.3, is consistent with a linear-potential threshold [\cite=microbridge]. For an even lattice, the average of the gain-potential is given by [formula]. The [formula] threshold is greatest when the change in the average strength is maximum as β is varied, ∂2βAE(β) = 0. In the limit N  ≫  1 and [formula], it implies that the N maxima of γPT(N,β) occur at βk, max = (2k + 1) / 2N. On the other hand, γPT(N,β) is smallest when the change in the average strength is minimum, ∂βAE(β) = 0, and gives the locations of (N - 1) minima as βk, min = k / N. A similar analysis applies to odd lattices, where the average potential is given by AO(β) =  sin [πβ(N  -  1)  /  2] sin [πβ(N  +  1)2]  /   sin (πβ).

Next, we focus on the location of the [formula] symmetry breaking. Due to the particle-hole symmetric spectrum of Hβ, two pairs of levels (En,En + 1) and ( - En, - En + 1) become complex simultaneously. Figure [\ref=fig:ptlocation] plots the indices of eigenvalues that become complex as a function of β for an N = 20 lattice with discretization δβ = 1 / 2N. It shows that at small β, the eigenvalues at the band edges become complex, whereas, as β  →  1 / 2, the pairs of eigenvalues that become complex move to the center of the band. Thus the average range of βs with the same location for [formula]-symmetry breaking is ~  1 / N. It follows that by choosing an appropriate β, one is able to control the location of [formula]-symmetry breaking in the energy spectrum. As we will see next, this control allows us to introduce competition between potentials Vβ with two different, but close, values of β.

[formula] phase diagram with two potentials. We now consider the [formula]-symmetric phase of the Hamiltonian with two potentials, H = H0 + Vβ1 + Vβ2, in the (γ1,γ2) plane, where both axes are scaled by their respective threshold values γjPT  =  γPT(βj). Panel (a) in Fig. [\ref=fig:pt1pt2] shows the numerically obtained phase diagram for an N = 20 lattice with (β1,β2) = (0.20,0.25) (blue stars and squares). It shows that, from a [formula]-broken phase (point 1), it is possible to enter the [formula]-symmetric phase by increasing the non-hermiticity γ1 (point 2). We emphasize that increasing γ1 increases the average gain- (and loss-) strength γ1AE(β1) + γ2AE(β2), and yet drives the system into a [formula]-symmetric phase from a [formula]-broken phase. Increasing γ1 further, eventually, drives the system into a [formula] broken phase again (point 3).

While a [formula]-broken phase implies an exponential time-dependence of the net intensity or the norm of a state, in the [formula]-symmetric phase the net intensity oscillates within a bound that is determined by the proximity of the Hamiltonian to the [formula] phase boundary [\cite=review2]. Panel (b) in Fig. [\ref=fig:pt1pt2] shows the dramatic consequences of [formula] restoration on the site- and time-dependent intensity I(k,t) = |〈k| exp ( - iHt / ψ0〉|2 of a state |ψ0〉 that is initially localized on site N / 2 = 10; the time is measured in units of [formula]. The top-subpanel shows that intensity has a monotonic amplification in regions with gain sites, leading to a striated pattern (point 1). Center subpanel shows that by increasing γ1, oscillatory behavior in the intensity is restored (point 2). Bottom subpanel shows that increasing γ1 further breaks the [formula] symmetry again (point 3). Thus, we are able to restore [formula]-symmetry by increasing the non-hermiticity, and achieve amplification by both reducing or increasing the average gain-strength. This novel behavior is absent in all lattice models with a single [formula] potential.

Since each potential Vβj breaks the [formula] symmetry for γj  /  γjPT > 1, naively, one may expect that the [formula] phase boundary for Vβ1 + Vβ2 is given by γ1  /  γ1PT  +  γ2  /  γ2PT = 1. This is indeed the case for (β1,β2) = (0.04,0.08), shown by red dashed line in panel (a), even though the potential periodicities differ by a factor of two.

What is the key difference between the two sets of parameters, one of which shows a re-entrant [formula]-symmetric phase? It is the indices of eigenvalues that become complex due to Vβ1 and Vβ2. The red rectangle in Fig. [\ref=fig:ptlocation] shows that for β  ≤  0.8, eigenvalues (E1,E2) become complex. In such a case, the two potentials Vβ1 and Vβ2 act in a cooperative manner effectively adding their strengths. Therefore, the [formula]-phase boundary is a straight line. In contrast, the blue oval in Fig. [\ref=fig:ptlocation] shows that for β1 = 0.20, energy levels E4,E5 approach each other, become degenerate, and then complex as γ  →  γ1PT; for β2 = 0.25, the energy levels that become complex as γ  →  γ2PT are E5,E6. Thus, the level E5 is lowered by potential Vβ1 and raised by the potential Vβ2 from its hermitian-limit value. This introduces competition between the two potentials Vβ1 and Vβ2 even though their gain-regions largely overlap and so do their respective loss regions.

This correspondence between completing potentials and [formula]-restoration is further elucidated in Fig. [\ref=fig:ptglobal]. In conjunction with Fig. [\ref=fig:ptlocation], it shows that re-entrant [formula]-symmetric phase occurs when the two potentials compete (panels b-e, g, h). This restoration of [formula]-symmetry can be due to increased loss-gain strength in γ1 (panels d, e), γ2 (panels b, c, g), or both (panel h). On the other hand, when the two potentials break the same set of eigenvalues, the [formula] phase boundary is a line (panels a, f, k).

Discussion. Competing potentials, a common theme in physics, often stabilize phases that would be unstable in the presence of only one of them [\cite=fradkin]. A trivial definition of competing [formula]-potentials is that the gain-region of one strongly overlaps with the loss-region of another, thus reducing the average gain (and loss) strength.

Here, we have unmasked the subtle competition between [formula] potentials whose gain regions largely overlap, based on the location of [formula]-symmetry breaking induced by each. This competition results in [formula]-restoration and subsequent [formula]-breaking, leading to selective intensity suppression and oscillations at large loss-gain strength. Its hints were seen in a continuum model with complex δ-function and constant potentials, but that continuum model is neither easily experimentally realizable nor can it tune between cooperative and competitive behavior [\cite=bijan]. The [formula]-symmetric Aubry-Andre model provides a family of potentials with tunable competition or cooperation among them, and is thus ideal for investigating the consequences of such competition; even lattices as small as N = 10 that can be realized via coupled optical waveguides [\cite=review1] [\cite=review2] or cold atoms [\cite=huang] may provide a comprehensive understanding of interplay between loss-gain strengths and [formula]-symmetry breaking.
