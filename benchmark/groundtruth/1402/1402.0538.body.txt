PLANK THEOREMS VIA SUCCESSIVE INRADII

Introduction

As usual, a convex body of the Euclidean space [formula] is a compact convex set with non-empty interior. Let [formula] be a convex body, and let [formula] be a hyperplane. Then the distance [formula] between the two supporting hyperplanes of [formula] parallel to H is called the width of [formula] parallel to H. Moreover, the smallest width of [formula] parallel to hyperplanes of [formula] is called the minimal width of [formula] and is denoted by [formula].

Recall that in the 1930's, Tarski posed what came to be known as the plank problem. A plank [formula] in [formula] is the (closed) set of points between two distinct parallel hyperplanes. The width [formula] of [formula] is simply the distance between the two boundary hyperplanes of [formula]. Tarski conjectured that if a convex body of minimal width w is covered by a collection of planks in [formula], then the sum of the widths of these planks is at least w. This conjecture was proved by Bang in his memorable paper [\cite=Ba51]. (In fact, the proof presented in that paper is a simplification and generalization of the proof published by Bang somewhat earlier in [\cite=Ba50].) Thus, we call the following statement Bang's plank theorem.

If the convex body [formula] is covered by the planks [formula] in [formula] (i.e., [formula]), then [formula].

In [\cite=Ba51], Bang raised the following stronger version of Tarski's plank problem called the affine plank problem. We phrase it via the following definition. Let [formula] be a convex body and let [formula] be a plank with boundary hyperplanes parallel to the hyperplane H in [formula]. We define the [formula]-width of the plank [formula] as [formula] and label it [formula]. (This notion was introduced by Bang [\cite=Ba51] under the name "relative width".)

If the convex body [formula] is covered by the planks [formula] [formula] in [formula], then [formula].

The special case of Conjecture [\ref=Bang-conjecture], when the convex body to be covered is centrally symmetric, has been proved by Ball in [\cite=Bal91]. Thus, the following is Ball's plank theorem.

If the centrally symmetric convex body [formula] is covered by the planks [formula] in [formula], then [formula].

It was Alexander [\cite=Al68] who noticed that Conjecture [\ref=Bang-conjecture] is equivalent to the following generalization of a problem of Davenport.

If a convex body [formula] in [formula] is sliced by n - 1 hyperplane cuts, then there exists a piece that covers a translate of [formula].

We note that the paper [\cite=BeBe96] of A. Bezdek and the author proves Conjecture [\ref=Alexander--Davenport] for successive hyperplane cuts (i.e., for hyperplane cuts when each cut divides one piece). Also, the same paper ([\cite=BeBe96]) introduced two additional equivalent versions of Conjecture [\ref=Bang-conjecture]. As they seem to be of independent interest we recall them following the terminology used in [\cite=BeBe96].

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let H be a hyperplane of [formula]. The [formula]-width of [formula] parallel to H is denoted by [formula] and is defined as [formula]. The minimal [formula]-width of [formula] is denoted by [formula] and is defined as the minimum of [formula], where the minimum is taken over all possible hyperplanes H of [formula]. Recall that the inradius of [formula] is the radius of the largest ball contained in [formula]. It is quite natural then to introduce the [formula]-inradius of [formula] as the factor of the largest positive homothetic copy of [formula], a translate of which is contained in [formula]. We need to do one more step to introduce the so-called successive [formula]-inradii of [formula] as follows.

Let r be the [formula]-inradius of [formula]. For any 0 < ρ  ≤  r let the [formula]-rounded body of [formula] be denoted by [formula] and be defined as the union of all translates of [formula] that are covered by [formula].

Now, take a fixed integer m  ≥  1. On the one hand, if ρ > 0 is sufficiently small, then [formula]. On the other hand, [formula]. As [formula] is a decreasing continuous function of ρ > 0 and mρ is a strictly increasing continuous function of ρ, there exists a uniquely determined ρ > 0 such that

[formula]

This uniquely determined ρ is called the mth successive [formula]-inradius of [formula] and is denoted by [formula].

Now, the two equivalent versions of Conjecture [\ref=Bang-conjecture] and Conjecture [\ref=Alexander--Davenport] introduced in [\cite=BeBe96] can be phrased as follows.

If a convex body [formula] in [formula] is covered by the planks [formula] [formula], then [formula] for any convex body [formula] in [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula]. If [formula] is sliced by n - 1 hyperplanes, then the minimum of the greatest [formula]-inradius of the pieces is equal to the nth successive [formula]-inradius of [formula], i.e., it is [formula].

Recall that Theorem [\ref=Ball-plank-th] gives a proof of (Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1] as well as) Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2] for centrally symmetric convex bodies [formula] in [formula] (with [formula] being an arbitrary convex body in [formula]). Another approach that leads to a partial solution of Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2] was published in [\cite=BeBe96]. Namely, in that paper A. Bezdek and the author proved the following theorem that (under the condition that [formula] is a ball) answers a question raised by Conway ([\cite=BeBe95]) as well as proves Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2] for successive hyperplane cuts.

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula], d  ≥  2. If [formula] is sliced into n  ≥  1 pieces by n - 1 successive hyperplane cuts (i.e., when each cut divides one piece), then the minimum of the greatest [formula]-inradius of the pieces is the nth successive [formula]-inradius of [formula] (i.e., [formula]). An optimal partition is achieved by n - 1 parallel hyperplane cuts equally spaced along the minimal [formula]-width of the [formula]-rounded body of [formula].

Akopyan and Karasev ([\cite=AkKa12]) just very recently have proved a related partial result on Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1]. Their theorem is based on a nice generalization of successive hyperplane cuts. The more exact details are as follows. Under the convex partition [formula] of [formula] we understand the family [formula] of closed convex sets having pairwise disjoint non-empty interiors in [formula] with [formula]. Then we say that the convex partition [formula] of [formula] is an inductive partition of [formula] if for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, there exists an inductive partition [formula] of [formula] such that [formula] for all j  ≠  i. A partition into one part [formula] is assumed to be inductive. We note that if [formula] is sliced into n pieces by n - 1 successive hyperplane cuts (i.e., when each cut divides one piece), then the pieces generate an inductive partition of [formula]. Also, the Voronoi cells of finitely many points of [formula] generate an inductive partition of [formula]. Now, the main theorem of [\cite=AkKa12] can be phrased as follows.

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let [formula] be an inductive partition of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Then [formula].

Extensions to Successive Inradii

First, we state the following stronger version of Theorem [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Conway]. Its proof is an extension of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Conway] published in [\cite=BeBe96].

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula], d  ≥  2 and let m be a positive integer. If [formula] is sliced into n  ≥  1 pieces by n - 1 successive hyperplane cuts (i.e., when each cut divides one piece), then the minimum of the greatest mth successive [formula]-inradius of the pieces is the (mn)th successive [formula]-inradius of [formula] (i.e., [formula]). An optimal partition is achieved by n - 1 parallel hyperplane cuts equally spaced along the minimal [formula]-width of the [formula]-rounded body of [formula].

Second, the method of Akopyan and Karasev ([\cite=AkKa12]) can be extended to prove the following stronger version of Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev]. In fact, that approach extends also the relavant additional theorems of Akopyan and Karasev stated in [\cite=AkKa12] and used in their proof of Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev]. However, in this paper following the recommendation of the referee, we derive the next theorem directly from Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev].

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let m be a positive integer. If [formula] is an inductive partition of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula]. If [formula] is an inductive partition of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then [formula].

For the sake of completeness we mention that in two dimensions one can state a bit more. Namely, recall that Akopyan and Karasev ([\cite=AkKa12]) proved the following: Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let [formula] be a partition of [formula] into convex bodies [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Then [formula]. Now, exactly the same way as Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek] is derived from Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev], it follows that [formula] holds for any positive integer m.

Finally, we close this section stating that Conjectures [\ref=Bang-conjecture],  [\ref=Alexander--Davenport],  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1], and  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2] are all equivalent to the following two conjectures:

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let m be a positive integer. If [formula] is covered by the planks [formula] [formula] in [formula], then [formula] or equivalently, [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let the positive integer m be given. If [formula] is sliced by n - 1 hyperplanes, then the minimum of the greatest mth successive [formula]-inradius of the pieces is the (mn)th successive [formula]-inradius of [formula], i.e., it is [formula].

In the rest of the paper we prove the claims of this section.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Conway-generalized]

On Coverings of Convex Bodies by Two Planks

On the one hand, the following statement is an extension to higher dimensions of Theorem 4 in [\cite=Al68]. On the other hand, the proof presented below is based on Theorem 4 of [\cite=Al68].

If a convex body [formula] in [formula] is covered by the planks [formula] and [formula], then [formula] for any convex body [formula] in [formula].

Let H1 (resp., H2) be one of the two hyperplanes which bound the plank [formula] (resp., [formula]). If H1 and H2 are translates of each other, then the claim is obviously true. Thus, without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] is a (d - 2)-dimensional affine subspace of [formula]. Let [formula] be the 2-dimensional linear subspace of [formula] that is orthogonal to L. If (  ·  )' denotes the (orthogonal) projection of [formula] parallel to L onto [formula], then obviously, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Thus, it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

In other words, it is sufficient to prove Lemma [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Alexander-inequality] for d = 2. Hence, in the rest of the proof, [formula], and H2 mean the sets introduced and defined above, however, for d = 2. Now, we can make the following easy observation

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then recall that Theorem 4 in [\cite=Al68] states that if a convex set in the plane is covered by two planks, then the sum of their relative widths is at least 1. Thus, using our terminology, we have that [formula], finishing the proof of Lemma [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Alexander-inequality].

Minimizing the Greatest mth Successive [formula]-Inradius

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula], d  ≥  2. We prove Theorem [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Conway-generalized] by induction on n. It is trivial to check the claim for n = 1. So, let n  ≥  2 be given and assume that Theorem [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Conway-generalized] holds for at most n - 2 successive hyperplane cuts and based on that we show that it holds for n - 1 successive hyperplane cuts as well. The details are as follows.

Let [formula] denote the hyperplanes of the n - 1 successive hyperplane cuts that slice [formula] into n pieces such that the greatest mth successive [formula]-inradius of the pieces is the smallest possible say, ρ. Then take the first cut H1 that slices [formula] into the pieces [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] (resp., [formula]) is sliced into n1 (resp., n2) pieces by the successive hyperplane cuts [formula], where n = n1 + n2. The induction hypothesis implies that [formula] and [formula] and therefore

[formula]

moreover,

[formula]

Now, we need to define the following set.

Assume that the origin [formula] of [formula] belongs to the interior of the convex body [formula]. Consider all translates of [formula] which are contained in the convex body [formula]. The set of points in the translates of [formula] that correspond to [formula] form a convex set called the inner [formula]-parallel body of [formula] denoted by [formula].

Clearly,

[formula]

Also, it is easy to see that there is a plank [formula] with [formula] such that it is parallel to H1 and contains H1 in its interior; moreover,

[formula]

Now, let H+1 (resp., H-1) be the closed halfspace of [formula] bounded by H1 and containing [formula] (resp., [formula]) and let [formula] (resp., [formula]). Moreover, let [formula] (resp., [formula]). Hence, applying Lemma [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Alexander-inequality] to [formula] partitioned into [formula] and to [formula] covered by the plank [formula] and the plank generated by the minimal [formula]-width of [formula] as well as to [formula] covered by the plank [formula] and the plank generated by the minimal [formula]-width of [formula] we get that

[formula]

By definition [formula] [formula], [formula] [formula] and [formula]. Hence, ([\ref=width-inequality-for-inner-parallel-bodies]) is equivalent to

[formula]

Finally, ([\ref=induction-hypothesis-1]),([\ref=induction-hypothesis-2]), and ([\ref=width-inequality-for-rounded-bodies]) yield that

[formula]

Thus, ([\ref=final-inductive-inequality]) clearly implies that [formula]. As the case, when the optimal partition is achieved, follows directly from the definition of the mnth successive [formula]-inradius of [formula], the proof of Theorem [\ref=Bezdek-Bezdek-Conway-generalized] is complete.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek]

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let m be a positive integer. It follows from the definition of [formula] that [formula] is a translation invariant, positively 1-homogeneous, inclusion-monotone functional over the family of convex bodies [formula] in [formula] for any fixed [formula] and m. On the other hand, if [formula] is an inductive partition of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev] applied to [formula] yields the existence of translation vectors [formula] and positive reals [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n satisfying [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

holds for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, finishing the proof of Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=corollary_of_Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek]

Let 1  ≤  m1  ≤  m2 be positive integers. Recall that if ρ1 (resp., ρ2) denotes the m1th (resp., m2th) successive [formula]-inradius of [formula], then by definition [formula] (resp., [formula]). As [formula] is a decreasing continuous function of ρ > 0, it follows that

[formula]

Thus, the sequence [formula] is an increasing one with

[formula]

Hence, Corollary [\ref=corollary_of_Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek] follows from Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek].

The equivalence of Conjectures [\ref=Bang-conjecture],  [\ref=Alexander--Davenport],  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1],  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2],  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11], and  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22]

Recall that according to [\cite=BeBe96] Conjectures [\ref=Bang-conjecture],  [\ref=Alexander--Davenport],  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1], and  [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2] are equivalent to each other. So, it is sufficent to show that Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1] implies Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11] and Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11] implies Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22] moreover, Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22] implies Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2].

As according to the previous section the sequence [formula] is an increasing one with [formula] therefore Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-1] implies Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11]. Next, it is obvious that Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22] implies Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-2]. So, we are left to show that Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11] implies Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22]. In order to do so we introduce the following equivalent description for [formula]. If [formula] is a convex body in [formula], then

[formula]

is called a linear packing of m translates of [formula] positioned parallel to the line [formula] with direction vector [formula] if the m translates of [formula] are pairwise non-overlapping, i.e., if

[formula]

holds for all 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  m (with λ1 = 0). Furthermore, the line [formula] passing through the origin [formula] of [formula] is called a separating direction for the linear packing

[formula]

if

[formula]

are pairwise non-overlapping intervals on l, where [formula] denotes the orthogonal projection of [formula] onto l. It is easy to see that every linear packing

[formula]

possesses at least one separating direction in [formula]. Finally, let [formula] be a convex body in [formula] and let m  ≥  1 be a positive integer. Then let [formula] be the largest positive real with the following property: for every line l passing through the origin [formula] in [formula] there exists a linear packing of m translates of [formula] lying in [formula] and having l as a separating direction. It is straightforward to show that

[formula]

Now, let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula] and let the positive integer m be given. Assume that the origin [formula] of [formula] lies in the interior of [formula]. Furthermore, assume that [formula] is sliced by n - 1 hyperplanes say, [formula] and let ρ be the greatest mth successive [formula]-inradius of the pieces of [formula] obtained in this way. Then let [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. Based on the above description of mth successive [formula]-inradii, it is easy to see that [formula] with [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. Thus, Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11] implies that [formula] and so, [formula]. Hence, [formula] finishing the proof of Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22].

Conclusion

Theorems [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev] and  [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek] have covering analogues. Namely recall that Akopyan and Karasev ([\cite=AkKa12]) introduced the following definition. Under the convex covering [formula] of [formula] we understand the family [formula] of closed convex sets in [formula] with [formula]. Then we say that the convex covering [formula] of [formula] is an inductive covering of [formula] if for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, there exists an inductive covering [formula] of [formula] such that [formula] for all j  ≠  i. A covering by one set [formula] is assumed to be inductive. [\cite=AkKa12] proves that if [formula] and [formula] are convex bodies in [formula] and [formula] is an inductive covering of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then [formula]. Now, exactly the same way as Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-Bezdek] is derived from Theorem [\ref=Akopyan-Karasev], it follows that

[formula]

holds for any positive integer m. This raises the following rather natural question (see also Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-11]).

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula], d  ≥  2 and let m be a positive integer. Prove or disprove that if [formula] is a convex partition (resp., covering) of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then [formula].

Next observe that ([\ref=Akopyan-Karasev-II]) implies in a straightforward way that if [formula] and [formula] are convex bodies in [formula] and [formula] is an inductive covering of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then the greatest mth successive [formula]-inradius of the pieces [formula] is at least [formula]. As the sequence [formula] is an increasing one, therefore [formula] raising the following question (see also Conjecture [\ref=Bezdek--Bezdek-22]).

Let [formula] and [formula] be convex bodies in [formula], d  ≥  2 and let m be a positive integer. Prove or disprove that if [formula] is a convex partition (resp., covering) of [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, then the greatest mth successive [formula]-inradius of the pieces [formula] is at least [formula].
