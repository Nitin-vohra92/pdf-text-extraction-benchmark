A hemispherical dynamo model : Implications for the Martian crustal magnetization

Introduction

Starting in 1998 the space probe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) delivered vector magnetic field data from orbits between 185 and 400 km above the planets surface [\citep=Acuna1999]. The measurements reveal a strong but heterogeneous crustal magnetization [\citep=Acuna1999] [\citep=Connerney2001]. The more strongly magnetized rocks are mainly localized in the southern hemisphere where the crust is thick and old. The northern hemisphere is covered by a younger and thinner crust which is much weaker magnetized.

Two alternative types of scenarios are discussed to explain this dichotomy. One type explores the possibility that an originally more or less homogeneous magnetization was partly destroyed by resurfacing events after the demise of the internal dynamo. Based on the fact that the Hellas and Argyre impact basins are largely void of magnetization, [\citet=Acuna2001] conclude that the dynamo stopped operating in the early Noachian before the related impact events happened roughly 3.7 - 4 Gyrs ago. Volcanic activity and crustal spreading are two other possibilities to explain the lack of strong magnetization in certain surface areas [\citep=Lillis2008b] [\citep=Mohit2004], in particular the northern hemisphere after the dynamo cessation.

The alternative scenario explains the dichotomy by an ancient Martian dynamo that inherently produced a hemispherical magnetic field. Numerical dynamo simulations by [\citet=Stanley2008] and [\citet=Amit2011] show that this may happen when more heat is allowed to escape the core through the southern than through the northern core mantle boundary (CMB). Such north/south asymmetry can for example be caused by larger impacts or low-degree mantle convection [\citep=Roberts2006] [\citep=Keller2009] [\citep=Yoshida2006]. Due to depth-dependent viscosity and a possible endothermic phase transition [\citep=Harder1996] Martian mantle convection may be ruled in an extreme case by one gigantic plume typically evoked to explain the dominance of the volcanic Tharsis region. However, the single plume convection might have developed after the dynamo ceased. Due to the hotter temperature of the rising material the CMB heat flux can be significantly reduced under such a plume. Though Tharsis is roughly located in the equatorial region it could nevertheless lead to magnetic field with the observed north-south symmetry, as we will show in the following.

The possible effects of large impacts on planets and the dynamo in particular are little understood. [\citet=Roberts2009] argue that impacts locally heat the underlying mantle and thereby lead to variations in the CMB heat flux. Large impacts may also cause a demise of the dynamo by reducing the CMB heat flux below the value where subcritical dynamo action is still possible [\citep=Roberts2009]. The deposition of heat in the outer parts of the core by impact shock waves could lead to a stably stratified core and thereby also stop dynamo action [\citep=Arkani-Hamed2010] for millions of years until the heat has diffused out of the core. If the iron content of the impactor is large enough it may even trigger a dynamo [\citep=Reese2010].

The thermal state of the ancient Martian core is rather unconstrained [\citep=Breuer2010]. Analysis of Martian meteorites suggests a significant sulphur content and thus a high core melting temperature [\citep=Dreibus1985]. Mars may therefore never have grown a solid inner core, an assumption we also adopt here [\citep=Schubert1990] [\citep=Breuer2010]. The ancient Martian dynamo was then exclusively driven by secular cooling and radiogenic heating and has stopped operating when the CMB heat flux became subadiabatic [\citep=Stevenson1983]. Run-away solidification or light element saturation may explain the dynamo cessation in the presence an inner core.

The geodynamo, on the other hand, is predominantly driven by the latent heat and light elements emanating from the growing inner core front. Secular cooling and radiogenic heating is typically modeled by homogeneously distributed internal buoyancy sources while the driving associated to inner core growth is modeled by bottom sources [\citep=Kutzner2000]. These latter sources have a higher Carnot efficiency and would likely have kept the Martian dynamo alive if the planet would have formed an inner core.

Several authors have explored the influence of a CMB heat flux pattern on dynamos geared to model Earth and report that they can cause hemispherical variations in the secular variation [\citep=Bloxham2000] [\citep=Christensen2003] [\citep=Amit2006], influence the reversal behavior [\citep=Glatzmaier1999] [\citep=Kutzner2004] or lead to inhomogeneous inner core growth [\citep=Aubert2008]. However, the effects where never as drastic as those reported by [\citet=Stanley2008] or [\citet=Amit2011]. In the work of [\citet=Amit2011] the reason likely is the increased susceptibility of internally driven dynamos to the thermal CMB boundary condition [\citep=Hori2010]. [\citet=Stanley2008] retain bottom driving and employed a particularly strong heat flux variation to enforce a hemispherical field

Here, we follow [\citet=Amit2011] in exploring the effects of a simple sinusoidal CMB heat flux variation on a dynamo model driven by internal heat sources. The main scope of this paper is to understand the particular dynamo mechanism, to explore its time dependence, and to extrapolate the results to the Martian situation. Section [\ref=Model] introduces our model, whereas section [\ref=hemisphericalaction] describes the effects of the CMB heat flux anomaly on the convection and the induction process. In section [\ref=applymars] we explore the applicability to the ancient Martian dynamo. The paper closes with a discussion in section [\ref=Discussion].

Numerical Model

Using the MagIC code [\citep=Wicht2002] [\citep=Christensen2007], we model the Martian core as a viscous, electrically conducting and incompressible fluid contained in a rotating spherical shell with inner core radius ricb and outer radius rcmb. Conservation of momentum is described by the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equation for a Boussinesq fluid:

[formula]

where [formula] is the velocity field, Π the generalized pressure, ẑ the direction of the rotation axis, T the super-adiabatic temperature and [formula] the magnetic field.

The conservation of energy is given by

[formula]

where ε is a uniform heat source density. The conservation of magnetic field is given by the induction equation

[formula]

We use the shell thickness D = rcmb - ricb as length scale, the viscous diffusion time D2  /  ν as time scale and (ρμλΩ)1 / 2 as the magnetic scale. The mean superadiabatic CMB heat flux density q0 serves to define the temperature scale q0D  /  cpρκ. Here, ν is the viscous diffusivity, ρ the constant background density, μ the magnetic permeability, λ the magnetic diffusivity, Ω the rotation rate, κ the thermal diffusivity and cp the heat capacity.

Three dimensionless parameters appear in the above system: the Ekman number E = ν  /  ΩD2 is a measure for the relative importance of viscous versus Coriolis forces while the flux based Rayleigh number Ra = αg0|q0|D4  /  ρcpκ2ν is a measure for the importance of buoyancy. The Prandtl number P = ν  /  κ and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm = ν  /  λ are diffusivity ratios.

An inner core with ricb / rcmb = 0.35 is retained for numerical reasons [\citep=Hori2010], but to minimize its influence the heat flux from the inner core is set to zero. The secular cooling and radiogenic driving is modeled by the homogeneous heat sources ε appearing in [\ref=heat] [\citep=Kutzner2000]. Furthermore we assume an electrically insulating inner core to avoid an additional sink for the magnetic field. We use no-slip, impermeable flow boundary conditions and match [formula] to a potential field at the outer and inner boundary. The results by [\citet=Hori2010] and [\citet=Aubert2009] suggest that this is a fair approximation to model a dynamo without inner core since an additional reduction of the inner core radius has only a minor impact. The effective heat source ε is chosen to balance the mean heat flux q0 through the outer boundary:

[formula]

Note that q0 is generally negative. The CMB heat flux pattern is modeled in terms of spherical harmonic contributions with amplitude qlm, where l is the degree and m the spherical harmonic order. Here we mostly concentrate on a variation along colatitude ϑ of the form q10 cos ϑ with negative q10 so that the minimum (maximum) heat flux is located at the north (south) pole. This is the most simple pattern to break the north/south symmetry and has first been used by [\citet=Stanley2008] in the context of Mars. We also explore the equatorially symmetric disturbance q11 sin ϑ sin φ, which breaks the east/west symmetry, and a superposition of q10 and q11 to describe a cosine disturbance with arbitrary tilt angle

[formula]

In the following we will characterize the amplitude of any disturbance by its maximum relative variation amplitude in percent

[formula]

We vary g up to 300%, the value used in [\citet=Stanley2008]. For variations beyond 100% the heat flux becomes subadiabatic in the vicinity of the lowest flux. For severely subadiabatic cases this may pose a problem since dynamo codes typically solve for small disturbances around an adiabatic background state [\citep=Braginsky1995]. The possible implication of this have not been explored so far and we simply assume that the model is still valid. Since the main effects described below do not rely on g > 100% this is not really an issue here.

The hemispherical mode triggered by the heat flux variation is dominated by equatorially anti-symmetric and axisymmetric thermal winds [\citep=Landeau2011]. Classical columnar convection found for a homogeneous heat flux, on the other hand, is predominantly equatorial symmetric and non-axisymmetric, at least at lower Rayleigh numbers. We thus use the relative equatorial anti-symmetric and axisymmetric (EAA) kinetic energy to identify the hemispherical mode:

[formula]

where Elm is the rms kinetic energy carried by a flow mode of spherical harmonic degree l and order m.

For a homogeneous outer boundary heat flux the dynamo is to first order of an α2-type where poloidal and toroidal fields are produced in the individual convective columns [\citep=Olson1999]. As the hemispherical flow mode takes over, the Ω-effect representing the induction of axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field via axisymmetric shearing becomes increasingly important. We measure its relative contribution to toroidal field production by

[formula]

The lower index tor and upper index rms indicate that rms values of the toroidal field production in the shell are considered.

For quantifying to which degree the Martian crustal magnetization and the poloidal magnetic fields in our dynamo simulations are concentrated in one hemisphere we use the hemisphericity measure

[formula]

where BNr(r) and BSr(r) are the surface integral over the unsigned radial magnetic flux in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. According to this definition both a purely equatorially symmetric and a purely equatorially anti-symmetric field yield H = 0. For H = 1 the flux is strictly concentrated in one hemisphere which requires a suitable combination of equatorially symmetric and anti-symmetric modes [\citep=Grote2000]. A potential field extrapolation is used to calculate H for radii above rcmb, for example the surface hemisphericity Hsur.

Table [\ref=#2]Tab1 provides an overview of the different parameter combinations explored in this study along with A, O, Hcmb, Hsur, the Elsasser number Λ = B2  /  μ0λρΩ and the field strength at the Martian surface in nano Tesla sur. Column 14 lists the respective (if present) dimensionless oscillation frequencies given in units of magnetic diffusion time.

We mostly focus on simulations at E = 10- 4 where the relatively moderate numerical resolution still allows to extensively explore the other parameters in the system. A few cases at [formula] and E = 10- 5 provide a first idea of the Ekman number dependence.The last line in table [\ref=Tab1] gives estimates for the Rayleigh, Ekman and magnetic Prandtl number of Mars, based on the (rather uncertain) properties of Mars [\citep=Morschhauser2011].

Hemispherical Solution

We start with discussing the emerging hemispherical dynamo mode promoted by the l = 1,m = 0 heat flux pattern with minimal (maximal) heat flux at the north (south) pole concentrating on cases at E = 10- 4, Ra = 4.0  ×  107 and Pm = 2. The study of [\citet=Landeau2011] reports the emergence of the equatorially anti-symmetric and axisymmetric convective mode if the Rayleigh number is sufficiently high. Note, that the authors used a homogeneous heat flux condition at the outer boundary. There the amplitude of the hemispherical convection becomes of equal strength compared to the columnar type in the pure hydrodynamic case and is even more dominant if the magnetic field can act on the flow [\citep=Landeau2011].

Hemispherical Convection

Figure [\ref=zonal] and [\ref=doublehammer] illustrate the typical hemispherical dynamo configuration emerging at g = 100% and compares this with the typical dipole dominated dynamo found at g = 0%. While the southern hemisphere is still cooled efficiently the northern hemisphere remains hot since radial upwellings and the associated convective cooling are predominantly concentrated in the southern hemisphere (figure [\ref=doublehammer], top row). The flow pattern changes from classical columnar solutions to a thermal wind dominated flow which is a direct consequence of the strong north/south temperature gradient (figure [\ref=zonal], left bottom). When neglecting inertial, viscous and Lorentz force contributions the azimuthal component of the curl of the Navier-Stokes equation [\eqref=nseq] yields:

[formula]

This is the thermal wind equation and the respective zonal flows will dominate the solution, indicated by large A values when the latitudinal temperature gradient is large enough [\citep=Landeau2011]. Since radial flows mainly exist in the southern hemisphere the production of poloidal and thus radial magnetic field is also concentrated there. This results in a very hemispherical magnetic field pattern at the top of the dynamo region (figure [\ref=doublehammer], bottom row).

The figure [\ref=sym_rel] demonstrates that the toroidal energy rises quickly with the variation amplitude g while the poloidal energy is much less effected. The growth of the toroidal energy is explained by the increasing thermal wind, which is an equatorial anti-symmetric and axisymmetric (EAA) toroidal flow contribution. At a disturbance amplitude of g = 60% the EAA contribution accounts for already 50% of the total kinetic energy (figure [\ref=sym_rel].b ). The maximum EAA contribution of [formula] is reached at g = 100%. When further increasing the variation amplitude, the thermal wind still gains in speed. However, the relative importance of the EAA mode decreases because the strongest latitudinal temperature gradient and thus the thermal wind structure moves further south. This trend is already observed in figure [\ref=zonal].

The equatorial anti-symmetry of the poloidal kinetic energy rises from 10% for g = 0 to about 50% for g = 100% reflecting that upwellings are increasingly concentrated in one (southern) hemisphere. The meridional circulation remains weak (figure [\ref=sym_rel].d), and its contribution to the total EAA energy is minor.

Dynamo mechanism

The upper panel in figure [\ref=tor_pol_ome] demonstrates that the rise in the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, that goes along with the increasing toroidal flow amplitude, does not necessarily lead to higher Elsasser numbers. Once more, cases at E = 10- 4, Ra = 4.0  ×  107 and Pm = 2 are depicted here. For small variation amplitudes up to g = 30% Λ still increases due to the additional Ω-effect associated to the growing thermal winds. Figure [\ref=tor_pol_ome] (lower panel) shows that the relative contribution of the Ω-effect to toroidal field production O grows with g. For g = 0 it is rather weak so that the dynamo can be classified as α2 [\citep=Olson1999]. Around g = 50%, O reaches 50% and the dynamo is thus of an α2Ω-type. When increasing g further the classical convective columns practically vanish and the associated α-effects decrease significantly, leading to both weak poloidal and toroidal fields (figure [\ref=tor_pol_ome], lower panel). For the toroidal field the effect is somewhat compensated by the growing Ω-effect. The hemispherical dynamo clearly is an αΩ-dynamo.

At g = 100% the hemispherical mode clearly dominates and the dynamo is of the αΩ-type with [formula]. The Elsasser number has dropped to half its value at g = 0 while the magnetic Reynolds number has increased by a factor two (figure [\ref=tor_pol_ome], upper panel). The hemispherical dynamo is clearly less effective than the columnar dynamo.

Figure [\ref=schema] illustrates the hemispherical dynamo mechanism in a 3D rendering. Magnetic field lines show the magnetic field configuration, their thickness is scaled with the local magnetic energy while red and blue colors intensities indicate the relative inward and outward radial field contribution. Plain gray lines are purely horizontal. Red and blue isosurfaces characterize inward and outward directed radial plume-like motions producing radial field magnetic field. Strong axisymmetric zonal field is produced by a thermal wind related Ω-effect around the equatorial plane.

Magnetic Oscillations

Figure [\ref=gaussplots] illustrates the changes in the time behavior of the poloidal magnetic field when the CMB heat flux variation is increased. We concentrate on axisymmetric Gaussian coefficients at the CMB (r = rcmb) here. In the reference case g = 0 (top panel) the axial dipole dominates, varies chaotically in time and never reverses. If g is increased to 50% (second panel) the relative importance of the axial quadrupole component has increased significantly, which indicates the increasing hemisphericity of the magnetic field. To yield a hemispherical magnetic field a similar amplitude in dipolar (equatorial antisymmetric) and quadrupolar (equatorial symmetric) dynamo family contributions is required [\citep=Landeau2011] [\citep=Grote2000].

When increasing the variation slightly to g = 60% (third panel) where the hemispherical mode finally dominates, all coefficients assume a comparable amplitude and oscillate in phase around a zero mean with a period of roughly half a magnetic diffusion time. The faster convective flow variations can still be discerned as a smaller amplitude superposition in figure [\ref=gaussplots].

The oscillation is also present in a kinematic simulation performed for comparison and is thus a purely magnetic phenomenon. Lorentz forces nevertheless cause the flow to vary along with the magnetic field. Since the coefficients vary in phase there are times where the magnetic field and thus the Lorentz forces are particularly weak or particularly strong. Figure [\ref=lorentz] illustrates the solutions at maximum (top) and minimum (middle) rms field strength. At the minimum the convective columns are still clearly present and the flow is similar to that found in the non-magnetic simulations shown in the lower panel of figure [\ref=lorentz]. At the maximum the Lorentz forces, in particular those associated with the strong zonal toroidal field, severely suppress the columns. The magnetic field thereby further promotes the dominance of the hemispherical mode [\citep=Landeau2011]. This becomes even more apparent when comparing the relative importance of the EAA mode A in magnetic and non-magnetic simulations in the top panel of figure [\ref=eaa_angle]. In the dynamo run A is around 35% higher than in the non-magnetic case for mild heat flux variation amplitudes.

When further increasing the amplitude of the CMB heat flux pattern, the frequency grows, the time behavior becomes somewhat more complex, and the different harmonics vary increasingly out of phase. In addition, the relative importance of harmonics higher than the dipole increase which indicates a concentration of the field at higher southern latitudes. The impact of the oscillations on the flows decreases since the hemispherical mode now always clearly dominates and the relative variation in the magnetic field amplitude becomes smaller.

The appearance of the oscillations may result from the increased importance of the Ω-effect which at g = 60% starts to dominate toroidal field production (see figure [\ref=tor_pol_ome], lower panel). The Ω-effect could be responsible for the oscillatory behavior of the solar dynamo as has, for example, been demonstrated by [\citet=Parker1955] who describes a simple purely magnetic wave phenomenon. [\citet=Busse2006] report Parker wave type oscillatory behavior in their numerical dynamo simulations where the stress free mechanical boundary conditions promote strong zonal flows and thus a significant Ω-effect.

Arbitrary tilt angle

To explore to which degree the effects described above still hold when the variation and rotation axis do not coincide we systematically vary the variation pattern tilt angle α (see eq. [\ref=defalpha]) up to 90 degrees. The lower panel in figure [\ref=eaa_angle] shows how A, the relative EAA kinetic energy, varies with g for different tilt angles. Somewhat surprisingly, the hemispherical mode still clearly dominates for tilt angles up to [formula]. Only the rather special case of [formula] shows a new behavior, where A remains negligible. It is thus the general breaking of the north/south symmetry that is essential here. Since it leaves the northern hemisphere hotter than the southern it always leads to the above described dynamo mode.

The 90 degree tilt angle of the (l = 1,m = 1) pattern forms a special case because the breaking of the north-south symmetry is missing here. Finally, the effects of the east/west symmetry breaking become apparent and supersede the thermal wind related action in the other cases. Figures [\ref=eq_vphi] and [\ref=t90_flow] illustrate the solution for an equatorial anomaly with g = 200%.

The resulting east/west temperature difference drives a large scale westward directed flow and a more confined eastward flow in the equatorial region of the outer part of the shell (figure [\ref=eq_vphi]). Coriolis forces divert the westward directed flow poleward and inward, and lead to the confinement of the eastward directed flow. Consequently, the westward flow plays the more important role here.

The diverted flows feed two distinct downwelling features that form at the latitude of zero heat flux disturbance close to the tangent cylinder. Due to the significant time dependence of the solution these can best be identified in time average flows shown in figure [\ref=t90_flow]. Convective columns concentrated in the high heat flux hemisphere but the center of their action is somewhat shifted retrograde, probably due to the action of azimuthal winds. Other authors have shown that this shift, for example, depends on the Ekman number [\citep=Christensen2003]. The remaining columns are small scale and highly time dependent. On time average only one column-like feature remains, identified by a strong downwelling somewhat west to the longitude of highest heat flux.

The time averaged flows form two main vorticity structures illustrated in figure [\ref=t90_flow]. A long anticyclonic structure associated to the strong equatorial westward flow stretches nearly around the globe and connects the equator with high latitudes inside the tangent cylinder. A smaller cyclonic feature is owed to the eastward equatorial flow.

The snapshot and time averaged radial magnetic fields shown in figure [\ref=t90_flow] are rather similar which demonstrates that the time dependent small scale convective features are not very efficient in creating larger scale coherent magnetic field. The radial field is strongly concentrated in patches above flow downwelling where the associate inflows concentrate the background field [\citep=Olson1999]. Like in the study for dynamos with homogeneous CMB heat flux by [\citet=Aubert2008] the anti-cyclone mainly produces poloidal magnetic field. The cyclone twists the field in the other direction and therefore is responsible for the pair of inverse (outward directed here) field patches located at mid latitudes in the western hemisphere. The exceptional strength of the high latitude normal flux patches suggests that additional field line stretching further intensified the field here.

Parameter Dependence

Focusing again at the axial heat flux anomaly we further study the influence of Rayleigh Ra, Ekman E and magnetic Prandtl number Pm. In general we find that, independently of the Ekman E and Rayleigh numbers Ra, a hemispherical dynamo mode is promoted once g reaches a value of 60%. Close to the onset of dynamo action a mild variation can help to maintain dynamo action due to the additional Ω-effect. See the cases at E = 10- 4 and either [formula], Pm = 2 or [formula], Pm = 1 in table [\ref=Tab1]. A strong amplitude of the heat flux anomaly can also suppress dynamo action due to the weakening of convective columns by the Lorentz force. For example, at E = 10- 4, [formula] and Pm = 2 the dynamo fails once g reaches 200%.

Figure [\ref=Hboth] shows how the CMB and surface hemisphericity (Hcmb , Hsur ) depends on the magnetic Reynolds number [formula] based on the equatorially anti-symmetric part of the zonal flow only and therefore useful to quantify the important Ω-effect in the hemispherical dynamo cases.

For E = 10- 4 the Hcmb values first increase linearly with [formula] and then saturates around [formula] for [formula]. All cases roughly follow the same curve with the exception of the peculiar [formula], Pm = 2 and g = 60% case described above. This means that there is a trade off between g, Ra and Pm; increasing either parameter leads to larger [formula] values. All the solution with hemisphericities    >  0.6 oscillate.

The few simulations at smaller Ekman numbers indicate that the degree of hemisphericity decreases with decreasing E. This is to be expected since the Taylor Proudman theorem becomes increasingly important [\citep=Landeau2011], inhibiting the ageostrophic hemispherical mode. Larger heat flux variation amplitudes can help to counteract this effect. Since both inertia and Lorentz forces can help to balance the Coriolis force, increasing either Ra or Pm also helps. For E = 3 an oscillatory case with  = 0.76 is found for the larger Rayleigh number of Ra = 4 and g = 100%. For E = 10- 5 [formula] remains small at g = 100% and we could not afford to increase Ra here since larger Ra as well as lower E values both promote smaller convective and magnetic length scales and therefore require finer numerical grids.

The decrease in length scales has another interesting effect on the radial dependence of hemisphericity. To yield a maximum hemisphericity, equatorially symmetric (l + m =  even) and anti-symmetric (l + m =  odd) magnetic field contributions must be of comparable strength, i.e. obey a 'whitish' spectrum (in a suitable normalization) [\citep=Grote2000]. Since, however, the radial dependence of the modes depends on the spherical harmonic degree (they decay like r- (l + 2) away from the CMB) the hemisphericity also depends on radius. The spectrum can only be perfectly 'white' at one radius. The smaller the scale of the magnetic field at rcmb the further this radius lies beyond rcmb. This explains why the Hsur values shown in the lower panel of figure [\ref=Hboth] show a much larger scatter than the Hcmb values. Larger values of Ra, E, but also g and Pm lead to small magnetic scales and thus larger ratios of [formula] over [formula].

Application to Mars

Could the hemispherical dynamo models presented above provide an explanation for the crustal magnetization found on Mars? To address this question we rely on the hemisphericity of the crustal magnetization and the magnetic field strength inferred from Martian meteorites. [\citet=Amit2011] use MGS data to estimate a hemisphericity between  = 0.45 and  = 0.65. The magnetization of the Martian meteorite (ALH 84001) suggest a field strength of the ancient dynamo between 5 and 50   [\citep=Weiss2002].

Because our simulations show that the magnetic field strength also varies significantly with the amplitude of the heat flux pattern, we rescale the dimensionless field strength in our simulations by assuming that the Elsasser number provides a realistic value. Assuming a magnetic diffusivity of λ = 1.32  m2  s- 1 and density of ρ = 7000  kg  m- 3, a rotation rate of Ω = 7.1  ×  10- 5  s- 1 and the magnetic vacuum permeability then allows to rescale the Elsasser number to dimensional field strengths. Time is rescaled via the magnetic diffusion time tλ = D2λ- 1 with an outer core radius of 1680  km.

We have included the Martian crustal hemisphericity values in the lower panel of figure [\ref=Hboth] to show that only oscillatory cases fall in the required range with heat flux variation amplitudes g  ≥  60% and   ≥  300. Figure [\ref=H_rad_evo] shows the temporal evolution of Hcmb and Hsur for one of these cases. The variation is surprisingly strong and oscillates at twice the frequency of the individual Gauss coefficients. Since all coefficients roughly oscillate with the same period there are two instances during each period where the hemisphericity is particularly large (around [formula]) since axial dipole and quadrupole have the same amplitude. Since the mean hemisphericity decreases with radius the variation amplitude is much higher at the planetary surface than at the CMB (figure [\ref=H_rad_evo]). The strong time dependence of oscillatory cases highlights that considerations over which period the magnetization was acquired are extremely important.

To translate the dynamo field into a magnetization pattern, [\citet=Amit2011] suggest two end-members of how the magnetization was acquired. In the first end-member scenario called 'random' the crustal magnetization is acquired randomly in time and space and, according to [\citet=Amit2011], should reflect the time averaged intensity. In the second end-member called 'continuous', magnetization is acquired in global thick layers, so that the time intensity of the time average field is considered. However, since the magnetization records the magnetic changes happening during the slow crust formation, the local net magnetization, as seen by an observer, is always proportional to the time averaged local magnetic field possibly slightly dominated by the outermost layers. We therefore think, that the random magnetization scenario does not apply. The strong magnetization found on Mars indicates that a significant portion of the crust is unidirectionally magnetized. [\citet=Langlais2004] estimated a magnetization depth of 20  -  40  km depending on the magnetization density. Crust formation is a rather slow process that may take millions of years. Typical magnetic time scales can be much shorter. The periods of the reversing strongly hemispherical dynamos discussed above, amount to not more than about ten thousand years.

Table [\ref=Tab1] lists the time averaged rescaled magnetic field intensity at the model Martian surface. For g  ≤  60% the field strengths are similar to that predicted for Mars [\citep=Weiss2002] and fall somewhat below this values for larger g-values. In the strongly hemispherical oscillating cases, however, the amplitude of the time average field average to zero on time scales of the crustal magnetization. We therefore conclude that while the hemispherical dynamos can reach hemisphericities similar to that of the Martian crustal magnetization their oscillatory nature makes them incompatible with the rather strong magnetization amplitude.

Discussion

We find that an equatorially anti-symmetric convective mode is consistently triggered by a cosine heat flux variation that allows more heat to escape through the southern than through the northern outer boundary of the dynamo region. When the variation is strong enough, convective up- and down-wellings are concentrated at the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere remains hot. The associated latitudinal temperature gradients drive strong thermal winds that dominate the flow when, for example, the variation amplitude g exceeds 50  % at E = 104. Tilting the heat flux pattern axis leaves the solution more or less unchanged with the exception of the [formula]-case where the equatorial symmetry remain unbroken. We conclude that breaking the equatorial symmetry is dynamically preferred over an equatorially oriented heat flux anomaly of the CMB heat flux.

Due to the thermal winds, the dynamo type changes from α2 to αΩ but is generally less efficient. Lorentz forces associated with the toroidal field created via the Ω-effect tend to kill whatever remains of classical columnar convection. This further increases the equatorial anti-symmetry of the solution. Poloidal fields are mainly produced by the southern up- and downwellings which lead to a hemispherical field pattern at the outer boundary.

When the hemisphericity approaches values of that found in Martian crustal magnetization, however, all dynamos start to oscillate on (extrapolated) time scales of the order of 10  kyr. These oscillations are reminiscent of previously described Parker waves in dynamo simulations [\citep=Busse2006]. As a typical characteristic of Parker waves, the frequency increases with the (square root of the) shear strength, see table [\ref=Tab1]. The oscillation periods are much shorter than the time over which the deep reaching Martian magnetization must have been acquired [\citep=Langlais2004]. Being a composite of many consecutive layers with alternating polarities the net magnetization would scale with the time averaged field and would therefore likely be much smaller than the predicted strength of the ancient Martian field magnetizing the crust [\citep=Weiss2002]. The maximum hemisphericity for non-oscillatory dynamos amounts to a configuration where the mean northern field amplitude is only 50% weaker than the southern. Additional effects like lava-overflows would then be required to explain the observed hemisphericity.

[\citet=Amit2011] [\citet=Stanley2008] also studied the effects of the identical sinusoidal boundary heat flux pattern and find very similar hemispherical solutions. [\citet=Amit2011] used a very similar setup to ours and also reported oscillations when the dynamo becomes strongly hemispherical. [\citet=Stanley2008] do not report the problematic oscillations intensively studied here, which may have to do with differences in the dynamo models. They study stress-free rather than rigid flow boundaries and assume that the growing inner core contributes to drive the dynamo while our model exclusively relies on internal heating. Should a hemispherical dynamo indeed be required to explain the observed magnetization dichotomy, this may indicate that ancient Mars already had an inner core. Alternatively efficient demagnetization mechanisms may have modified an originally more or less homogeneous magnetized crust [\citep=Shahnas2007].

[\citet=Landeau2011] observed that similar hemispherical dynamos are found when the Rayleigh number exceeds a critical value. However, albeit the effects are significantly smaller than when triggered via the boundary heat flux. All the cases explored here remain below this critical Rayleigh number. [\citet=Landeau2011] also mentioned that the equatorial anti-symmetry, and thus the hemisphericity of the magnetic field, decreases when the Ekman number is decreased. Our simulations at lower Ekman number seem to confirm this trend although a meaningful extrapolation to the Martian value of E = 3  ×  10- 15 would require further simulations at lower Ekman numbers. To a certain extent the decrease can be compensated by increasing the heat flux variation amplitude, the Rayleigh number or the magnetic Prandtl number.

Our results show that a north-south symmetry breaking induced by lateral CMB heat flux variations can yield surprisingly strong effects. Fierce thermal winds and local southern upwellings take over from classical columnar convection and the dynamo changes from an α2 to an αΩ-type. The dominant Ω-effect seems always linked to Parker-wave-like field oscillations typically discussed for stellar applications. It will be interesting to further explore the aspects independent of the application to Mars.
