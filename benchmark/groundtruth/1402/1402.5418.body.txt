Self-sustained asymmetry of lepton-number emission: A new phenomenon during the supernova shock-accretion phase in three dimensions

Introduction

Nonradial hydrodynamic instabilities play an important role in the postbounce dynamics of collapsing stellar cores on their way to the onset of supernova (SN) explosions. They also accompany the formation and cooling of the proto-neutron star (PNS). These phenomena include convection in the PNS, large-scale convective overturn below the stalled shock wave during the accretion-shock phase, and the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). We presently add a new phenomenon to this list which we call LESA for "Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry." Its most conspicuous manifestation is lepton-number flux (νe minus e) emission primarily in one hemisphere, but it also involves dipolar asymmetry of convection inside the PNS and different strengths of large-scale convective overturn below the stalled shock in both hemispheres.

We first recall these traditional spherical-symmetry breaking instabilities and begin with convection. Prompt postshock convection leads to the decay of the negative entropy and electron-number gradients left behind by the weakening bounce shock and the shock-breakout burst of electron neutrinos, respectively [\citep=Burrows_1992] [\citep=Janka_1993] [\citep=Mueller_1994]. It fosters shock expansion and acts as a source of gravitational-wave emission for a period of some ten milliseconds after core bounce [\citep=Mueller_1997] [\citep=Mueller_2013]. Inside the nascent neutron star (NS), i.e. below (and possibly also around) the neutrinosphere, Ledoux convection was expected to occur because of the negative lepton number gradient produced by the inward progression of the deleptonization wave associated with neutrino losses [\citep=Epstein_1979] [\citep=Burrows_1988]. In two-dimensional (2D) simulations (axial symmetry), PNS convection was first studied by [\citet=Keil_1996] and later again by [\citet=buras_06b] and [\citet=Dessart_2006].

Large-scale convective overturn below the stalled shock was predicted by [\citet=bethe_90] and confirmed by the first 2D hydrodynamical simulations [\citep=Herant_1992] [\citep=Herant_1994] [\citep=Burrows_1995] [\citep=Miller_1993] [\citep=Janka_1995] [\citep=Janka_1996] [\citep=Mezzacappa_1998] as well as in 3D [\citep=Fryer_2002] [\citep=Fryer_2004]. The driving force is a negative entropy gradient that develops a few tens of milliseconds after core bounce in the neutrino-heating region between the gain radius (where neutrino heating begins to exceed neutrino cooling) and the stalled shock. Convective flows stretch the dwelling time of matter in the gain layer and thus increase the energy deposition by neutrinos. This effect can provide crucial support to the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism: multi-D simulations can yield explosions even when spherically symmetric models fail (e.g., [\citealt=Janka_1996] [\citealt=Murphy_2008] [\citealt=Nordhaus_2010] [\citealt=Hanke_2012] [\citealt=Dolence_2013] [\citealt=Couch_2013] [\citealt=Couch_2013a]).

The delayed-explosion mechanism is also aided by SASI, which leads to violent shock sloshing motions. This effect expands the shock, increases the gain layer and, again, can enhance the efficiency of neutrino-energy deposition [\citep=marek_09] even when convection is weak or its growth is suppressed because of a small shock-stagnation radius and correspondingly fast infall velocities in the gain layer [\citep=Foglizzo_2006] [\citep=Scheck_2008]. This nonradial instability was first observed in 2D simulations with a full 180[formula] grid [\citep=Janka_1996] [\citep=Mezzacappa_1998] [\citep=Janka_2003] [\citep=Janka_2004], but not immediately recognized as a new effect beyond large-scale convection. It was unambiguously identified in 2D hydrodynamical simulations of idealized, adiabatic (and thus non-convective) postshock accretion flows [\citep=Blondin_2003]. SASI was found to possess the highest growth rates for the lowest-order (dipole and quadrupole) spherical harmonics [\citep=Blondin_2006] [\citep=Foglizzo_2007] [\citep=Iwakami_2008] and to give rise to spiral-mode mass motions in 3D simulations [\citep=Blondin_2007] [\citep=Iwakami_2009] [\citep=Fernandez_2010] [\citep=Hanke_2013] or in 2D setups without the constraint of axisymmetry [\citep=Blondin_2007] [\citep=Yamasaki_2008] [\citep=Foglizzo_2012]. The instability can be explained by an advective-acoustic cycle of amplifying entropy and vorticity perturbations in the cavity between accretion shock and PNS surface [\citep=Foglizzo_2002] [\citep=Foglizzo_2007] [\citep=Scheck_2008] [\citep=Guilet_2012] and has important consequences for NS kicks [\citep=Scheck_2004] [\citep=Scheck_2006] [\citep=Nordhaus_2010b] [\citep=Nordhaus_2012] [\citep=Wongwathanarat_2010] [\citep=Wongwathanarat_2013] and spins [\citep=Blondin_2007] [\citep=Rantsiou_2011] [\citep=Guilet_2013], quasi-periodic neutrino emission modulations [\citep=Marek_2009] [\citep=Lund_2010] [\citep=Tamborra_2013], and SN gravitational-wave signals [\citep=Marek_2009] [\citep=Murphy_2009] [\citep=Mueller_2013].

Here we report the discovery of a new type of low-mode nonradial instability, LESA, which we have observed in 3D hydrodynamical simulations with detailed, energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino transport using the Prometheus-Vertex code. Our current portfolio of simulated 3D models includes an [formula] model that shows violent large-scale convection, but no obvious signs of SASI activity during the simulated period of postbounce evolution, and two models (20[formula] and 27 [formula]) in which episodes of SASI alternate with phases of dominant large-scale convection [\citep=Hanke_2013] [\citep=Tamborra_2013] [\citep=Tamborra_2014]. While all models exhibit LESA, with different orientations of the emission dipole, the clearest case is the [formula] model, because the new effect is not overlaid with SASI activity.

To provide a first impression of our new and intriguing phenomenon we show in Fig. [\ref=fig:leptonskyplots] the distribution of lepton-number emission (νe minus e) for the [formula] model over the stellar surface at postbounce (p.b.) times of 148, 169, 210, and 240 ms. In each panel, the lepton-number flux is normalized to the instantaneous average and the color scale covers the range from -  0.5 to 2.5 of this relative measure. We indicate the positive dipole direction with a black dot, the negative direction with a cross. We also show the track of the positive dipole direction as a dark-gray line, ranging from 70 ms p.b., where the dipole begins forming, to the end of the simulation at 340 ms. While at 148 ms the dipole pattern is not yet strong--a quadrupole component is clearly visible and the dipole is still building up as we will see later--the subsequent snapshots reveal a strong dipole pattern with large amplitude: In the negative-dipole direction, the lepton-number flux is around zero, and even negative in some small regions, whereas in the positive direction it is roughly twice the average and even larger in some small regions.

LESA is a large and conspicuous effect concerning the deleptonization flux. At the same time, it is associated with more subtle dipole deformations of other quantities. In particular, the dipolar lepton-number emission is linked to anisotropic PNS convection, which leads to an aspherical electron distribution in the PNS mantle layer. The emission dipole is additionally fed by a hemispheric mass-accretion asymmetry, which might cause the one-sided enhancement of PNS convection. This accretion asymmetry in turn is a consequence of a dipolar shock deformation that deflects the accretion flow preferentially to one hemisphere. Despite vigorous and highly time-variable, nonstationary convective overturn stirring the postshock region, the shock deformation and mass-accretion asymmetry are maintained for hundreds of milliseconds by a neutrino-heating asymmetry that is tightly linked to the neutrino-emission anisotropy: Because e have somewhat harder spectra than νe, neutrino heating on the side of a relatively higher e flux (the side with lowest lepton-number flux and lowest mass accretion rate) is stronger and sustains the dipolar shock deformation that produces the hemispheric asymmetry of the postshock accretion flow.

This preliminary interpretation suggests that LESA is not a purely hydrodynamical phenomenon, in contrast to the traditional instabilities, but depends on a complex interaction of hydrodynamic mass flow and neutrino emission and heating.

Our new effect is predominantly a hemispheric asymmetry in these quantities and as such is not a generic 3D effect, but it has not been previously reported in the context of 2D simulations. Actually, indications of LESA may be present in the O-Ne-Mg core explosions of [\citet=Wanajo_2011] and in a [formula] explosion model of [\citet=mueller_12]. However, it seems difficult to make a strong case for this neutrino-hydrodynamical instability based on 2D simulations. The constraint of axisymmetry resticts any dipole asymmetry to the direction of the polar axis of the grid. This symmetry axis, where reflecting boundary conditions are imposed, defines a preferred direction and has various problematic consequences. It tends to artificially create hemispheric differences by deflecting the converging flows either inward or outward, and the grid axis also directs shock-sloshing motions. Strong bipolar motions of the postshock accretion layer in most 2D simulations, where shock expansion and contraction alternate violently between the poles, could interfere with the LESA phenomenon or even create asymmetries of different nature.

In the following, we first describe briefly, in Sect. [\ref=sec:numerics], the numerical setup of our 3D simulations and the overall properties of our three progenitor models. In Sect. [\ref=sec:results] we study various manifestations of our new phenomenon, ranging from dipole deformations of neutrino-emission properties to asymmetric PNS convection. Next we turn in Sect. [\ref=sec:feedback-loop] to more subtle manifestations in the form of asymmetric accretion and neutrino heating, which however form a feedback loop and as such are the driving engine of the overall effect. In Sect. [\ref=sec:explanation] we string the different elements together and provide an overall scenario that involves the outer feedback mechanism consisting of asymmetric mass accretion and neutrino heating and the inner mechanism of asymmetric electron-density distribution and PNS convection. We conclude in Sect. [\ref=sec:conclusions] with a summary and a discussion of possible implications.

Numerical 3D Models

The calculations of our 3D models were performed with the elaborate neutrino-hydrodynamics code Prometheus-Vertex. This SN simulation tool combines the hydrodynamics solver Prometheus [\citep=fryxell_89], which is a dimensionally-split implementation of the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) of [\citet=colella_84], with the neutrino transport module Vertex [\citep=rampp_02]. Vertex solves the fully energy-dependent moment equations for the neutrino energy and momentum densities, with O(v / c) velocity dependence, for spherically symmetric transport problems defined to be associated with every angular bin of the polar grid ("radial rays") used for the multi-dimensional simulations. The moment equations are closed by a variable Eddington factor relation that is provided by the formal solution of a model Boltzmann equation. An up-to-date set of neutrino interaction rates is applied in Vertex (see, e.g., [\citealt=mueller_12]). In the multi-dimensional case, our "ray-by-ray-plus" approach [\citep=buras_06a] includes non-radial neutrino advection and pressure terms in addition to the radial transport solves. The ray-by-ray approximation implies that we assume the neutrino radiation field to be axially symmetric around the radial direction and thus ignore nonradial components of the neutrino flux. In the simulations presented here, we adopted monopolar gravity but included general relativistic corrections by means of an effective gravitational potential [\citep=marek_06].

We have performed 3D simulations for the evolution of the 11.2 [formula] and 27 [formula] progenitors of [\citet=woosley_02] and the 20 [formula] model of [\citet=Woosley_2007], using the high-density equation of state (EoS) of [\citet=lattimer_91] with a nuclear incompressibility of K = 220 MeV. The 11.2 [formula] and 27 [formula] stars had been previously investigated in 2D by [\citet=buras_06b], [\citet=marek_09], [\citet=mueller_12], and [\citet=mueller_12b]. Our 3D models were computed on a spherical polar grid with an initial resolution of nr  ×  nθ  ×  nφ  =  400  ×  88  ×  176 zones. Later, refinements of the radial grid ensured adequate resolution in the PNS surface region. The innermost 10 km were treated in spherical symmetry to avoid excessive time-step limitations near the polar grid axis. Doing so we took special care to ensure that the convectively unstable layer below the neutrinosphere and the corresponding undershooting region were fully covered by the 3D grid during the entire simulations. Seed perturbations for aspherical instabilities were imposed by hand 10 ms after core bounce by introducing random perturbations of 0.1% in density on the entire computational grid. None of these models led to successful explosions during the simulation periods of 350 ms for the 11.2 [formula] model, 420 ms for the [formula] progenitor, and 575 ms for the [formula] case.

The postbounce hydrodynamics of the [formula] model, in particular the prominent presence of SASI sloshing and spiral modes, was described in detail in a previous paper [\citep=Hanke_2013]. Basic properties of the neutrino signal and its detection were subject of a recent paper by [\citet=Tamborra_2013], highlighting the large-amplitude, quasi-periodic modulations of the radiated luminosities and mean energies associated with the SASI activity. In addition, information about the expected neutrino signal from the [formula] and [formula] runs was shown. More details on the neutrino emission of all three 3D simulations and implications for the direction dependent detectability of SN neutrino signals will be discussed in [\citet=Tamborra_2014].

The 27 [formula] and the 20 [formula] models both show periods of strong SASI activity. In the former case, which was simulated until 575 ms p.b., a first phase of violent SASI occurs between ~  170 ms and ~  260 ms [\citep=Hanke_2013], and a second SASI episode sets in at ~  420 ms after an intermediate period of essentially pure convective overturn. In the 20 [formula] case strong SASI mass motions take place from ~  170 ms until ~  305 ms, and SASI reappears after 400 ms, shortly before the simulation run was stopped. On the other hand, the 11.2 [formula] model does not exhibit any clear evidence of SASI motions but develops the typical signatures of postshock convective overturn in the neutrino-heating layer as evident from our Fig. [\ref=fig:3dconv11], to be compared with the 27 [formula] case in Fig. 1 of [\citet=Hanke_2013]. In the 11.2 [formula] model, the short-timescale neutrino-emission variations are distinctly smaller than in the SASI-active models [\citep=Tamborra_2013] [\citep=Tamborra_2014].

In the 11.2 [formula] simulation, first indications of postshock convection become visible at about 80 ms p.b., shortly after a gain region below the stalled shock has developed. Buoyant, mushroom-like plumes appear, which are initially small and then successively replaced by larger ones. At 100 ms p.b., first evidence of shock deformation occurs, and after about 140 ms, convective overturn has attained its full strength with a ratio of maximum to minimum shock radius of up to [formula]. The expansion of the accretion shock continues until about 210 ms p.b., when the average shock radius reaches a maximum of ~  260 km (see Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry] below). It is followed by a slow but monotonic recession of the average shock radius to only 150 km at the end of the simulation at 350 ms. No explosion has set in until this stage, in contrast to the corresponding 2D calculation with the same microphysics, same numerical treatment, and in particular the same radial and angular grid resolution. In the 2D case, the shock continues to expand, supported by large-amplitude shock-sloshing motions along the symmetry axis. More and more favorable conditions for an explosion develop until finally, at roughly 350 ms p.b., the shock accelerates and triggers an outgoing blast wave, whereas the 3D case at this time shows little promise of an explosion.

Apparently, the 3D setup with the chosen angular resolution (limited by the requirements of computational resources, which are prohibitive for our sophisticated treatment of neutrino transport) is less beneficial for the possibility of a SN explosion by the neutrino-driven mechanism. This finding is in line with recent investigations based on cruder treatments of neutrino physics, namely a neutrino-light bulb description with simple heating and cooling terms [\citep=Hanke_2012] [\citep=Couch_2013], ray-by-ray neutrino trapping with a parametrized heating strength [\citep=Couch_2013a], and a ray-by-ray implementation of the isotropic diffusion source approximation [\citep=Takiwaki_2013]. However, the difference between 2D and 3D models is not subject of our present discussion and we next turn to the new phenomenon of asymmetric lepton-number emission.

Persistent Dipole Asymmetries of 3D Models

Evolution of lepton-number emission dipole

We have recently explored the flavor-dependent neutrino emission of our 3D simulations to forecast possible signatures of hydrodynamical instabilities in large-scale neutrino detectors [\citep=Tamborra_2013] and as a prerequisite for flavor oscillation studies. A systematic analysis has revealed a long-lasting, slowly evolving dipole asymmetry of the lepton-number (νe minus e) emission from the newly formed NS. In Fig. [\ref=fig:leptonskyplots] we have shown typical directional distributions of the lepton-number flux for our [formula] model. This pronounced asymmetry builds up in parallel to the development of large-scale convective overturn behind the stalled shock and shows a fairly stable direction, which has no particular correlation with the numerical coordinate grid.

Before attempting a physical interpretation of this puzzling phenomenon, we first collect a number of conspicuous phenomenological manifestations. A natural first question is to see when and how this effect builds up in the course of postbounce core-collapse evolution and if it is correlated with other symmetry-breaking hydrodynamical instabilities.

To quantify the time evolution of our new effect we consider the lowest-order multipole components of the lepton-number flux as a function of emission direction. To clarify our normalization of the dipole component we note that if the lepton-number flux distribution contains only a monopole and dipole term, then the distribution is in coordinates aligned with the dipole direction. When the ratio of these amplitudes is unity, the distribution is proportional to 1 +  cos ϑ and the lepton-number flux vanishes in the direction of minimal flux and is twice the average in the direction of maximal flux, corresponding roughly to what we see in Fig. [\ref=fig:leptonskyplots]. AMonopole is nothing but the total rate of lepton number emitted by the evolving PNS, whereas ADipole is 3 times the projection of the total lepton-number flux onto the dipole direction.

Figure [\ref=fig:dipole11] shows the evolution of AMonopole and ADipole and the dipole direction for our three progenitor models. The total lepton-number emission is at first off-scale, corresponding to the usual prompt νe burst, and then decreases monotonically with small modulations caused by large-scale convection and concomitant variations of the postshock accretion flow. The overall lepton-number emission is fed by the mass-accretion flow so that it is not surprising that the monopole strength depends considerably on the progenitor model.

In all models, a dipole component becomes first discernible at about 50 ms p.b., grows for 100-150 ms, and later begins to decrease, more or less in parallel with the overall decline of the lepton-number emission. The dipole decay is not monotonic and has an overall gradient that is different in the different progenitors (steepest in the 11.2 [formula] model). In this later phase, the dipole amplitude sometimes exceeds the monopole, meaning that in the negative dipole direction, the lepton-number flux is somewhat negative (excess of e over νe emission). The overall dipole strength is similar in all three progenitor models, at the peak reaching a value of ~  3-[formula].

While in all three models the dipole growth sets in and reaches large amplitudes during an early, convection-dominated postbounce phase, before SASI activity starts in the postshock layer, it is remarkable that SASI seems to have different consequences for the LESA evolution in the 20 [formula] and 27 [formula] models. In the former case the lepton-number emission dipole continues to grow even after the onset of SASI and reaches its full strength during the SASI-dominated phase. In contrast, in the 27 [formula] model the onset of SASI seems to prevent a further growth of the dipole amplitude, which instead performs quasi-periodic oscillations around a stable level somewhat below the maximum dipole amplitudes in the 11.2 and 20 [formula] models. The dipole continues to develop to its peak amplitude only after the SASI episode has ended and convective overturn becomes the dominant hydrodynamic instability in the postshock accretion layer again. We will come back to this interesting difference later in our discussion of the physical elements and underlying physical mechanism of LESA (see Sect. [\ref=sec:modelswithsasi]).

The dipole orientation on the computational polar grid is expressed by latitudinal and azimuthal polar angles θ and φ, respectively. The zenith angle, θ, varies from π / 2 (north pole of numerical grid) to -  π / 2 (south pole), whereas -  π  ≤  φ  ≤  π is measured relative to the x-axis of the grid. The dipole direction slowly drifts, but remains fairly stable once the dipole is well developed. This conclusion also follows from the dipole's sky-track shown as a dark-gray line in Fig. [\ref=fig:leptonskyplots] for the [formula] case. It is remarkable that this behavior is quite similar in the higher-mass (20 and 27 [formula]) progenitors, where phases with dominant large-scale convection alternate with phases of pronounced SASI activity, which are indicated in Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11] by horizontal bars. The SASI action is clearly visible in the form of small, periodic modulations of the overall deleptonization flow and much larger modulations of the dipole strength and direction with typical oscillation periods of ~  10-20 ms. Yet, even these modulations are only relatively small variations of the dipole strength and its orientation in space, not changing the hemispheric location of the whole phenomenon. The initial, large movement of the azimuthal angle from +  180[formula] to about -  90[formula] that happens between about 90 and 110 ms in the case of the 20 [formula] model (Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11]) occurs in a phase when the dipole is still building up and its amplitude is correspondingly small. Therefore the dipole direction is not particularly meaningful and the step-like jumps of its azimuth angle simply reflect stochastical fluctuations. At later times the dipole orientations in all three models exhibit only very slow drifts.

The lepton-emission dipole is a long-lasting, persistent, and only slowly evolving phenomenon. Its dipole direction remains in the same hemisphere for periods of hundreds of milliseconds, i.e., for nearly the whole computed postbounce evolution. A slow overall drift of the dipole direction (mainly in the 20 and 27 [formula] models) happens on timescales much longer than the typical dynamical timescales in the convective layers inside the PNS and between the gain radius and stalled shock. With convective velocities of up to a few 108 cm s- 1 in the former case and up to more than 109 cm s- 1 in the latter, convective overturn timescales are typically milliseconds in the PNS and around ~  10 ms in the neutrino-heating region. These timescales depend on the radial diameter of the PNS convection zone (roughly 10 km, which also determines the angular scale of ~  20-40[formula] of convective cells there) and on the shock stagnation radius, respectively. The dynamical timescales of the postshock region are reflected by the SASI-imprinted modulations of dipole strength and spatial orientation visible in Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11]. Convective activity in both regions is highly time dependent and nonstationary, and individual convective cells and buoyant bubbles have life times that are usually not much longer than one or two overturns (for PNS convection this was discussed by [\citealt=Keil_1996] [\citealt=Dessart_2006]). It is therefore astonishing that despite such an extreme time variability of the environment a hemispheric emission asymmetry can survive over many tens of dynamical periods. Only over long, secular timescales SASI or convectively induced changes of the system seem to lead to a gradual, slow drift of the dipole orientation as seen in all models but especially in those with episodes of vigorous SASI activity (Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11], panels in the middle and right columns).

These simple observations already suggest that the LESA phenomenon must physically depend on a complicated interplay of different effects. The initial growth over 100-150 ms parallels the growth of large-scale convection in the gain region, suggesting gain-region convection as the primary engine. On the other hand, the persistence throughout SASI episodes and the near-universal dipole strength suggest that LESA must also be anchored to deeper regions. We will see that indeed it originates in the PNS convection region deep below the neutrinospheres.

Overall neutrino emission properties

Before turning to physical interpretations, however, we first continue with our description of phenomenological observations in our numerical models. In particular, one may wonder if the overall neutrino emission parameters exhibit any peculiarities, but this is not the case. We specifically show in Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoemission] the evolution of the overall energy-loss rate for the [formula] model in the three species νe, e, and νx, i.e., we display the 4π-integrated energy fluxes,

[formula]

where [formula] is the ray-by-ray computed energy-flux density at a point [formula] of a chosen sphere with radius R  =  ||. The quantity [formula] is usually called "luminosity" but it is not measurable in the multi-dimensional case by observers at any location. The bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoemission] shows the corresponding 4π-averaged mean energies, 〈ενi〉, which are defined as the ratios of energy-loss rates to number-loss rates.

This figure reveals the usual behavior during the postbounce accretion phase (compare, e.g., with results by [\citealt=marek_09] [\citealt=Marek_2009] [\citealt=Janka_2012]). [formula] after the shock-breakout burst is very close to [formula] or even slightly larger, while 〈εe〉 exceeds 〈ενe〉 by a few MeV. Heavy-lepton neutrinos have significantly lower individual luminosities because their production in the accretion layer of the PNS is less efficient due to the lack of charged-current processes, and 〈ενx〉 is only slightly larger than 〈εe〉 because energy transfers in neutrino-nucleon scatterings reduce the high-energy spectrum of νx diffusing outward from their deeper production layers [\citep=Raffelt_2001] [\citep=Keil_2003].

Here as well as in the following discussion we mostly focus on the 11.2 [formula] star. This has two reasons. On the one hand, the 11.2 [formula] model does not possess the violent SASI episodes which massively affect the neutrino-emission properties in the 20 and 27 [formula] cases [\citep=Tamborra_2013] [\citep=Tamborra_2014] [\citep=Hanke_2013], where they lead to time-dependent variations of the neutrino transport and radiation, superimposed on the hemispheric asymmetry of the lepton-number emission dipole (Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11]). Such short-time fluctuations can hamper the easy visibility of the LESA-specific features. On the other hand, outside of the SASI episodes diagnostic quantitities that we evaluate for the lepton-emission dipole in the 20 and 27 [formula] models look, qualitatively and quantitatively, very similar to those that we present in more detail for the 11.2 [formula] case. This will be shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry].

Other flux asymmetries

The LESA phenomenon is a conspicuous order-unity effect of the directional lepton-number flux variation, but also shows up in other quantities, notably in the directional variation of the individual νe and e fluxes. To illustrate this point we show in Fig. [\ref=fig:fluxvariations] these number fluxes as they would be seen by a distant observer relative to their directional averages. We use three viewing directions oriented relative to the lepton-number dipole axis, i.e., an observer located in the direction of maximal lepton-number flux (black lines), the opposite direction of minimal lepton-number flux (red lines), and a typical direction transverse to the dipole axis (dashed blue lines).

A distant observer measures the integrated intensity over a hemisphere of the radiating NS surface, projected on the viewing direction. The corresponding "averaging" over the visible hemisphere eliminates small-scale variations. To evaluate the observational quantities we follow the procedure described in Sect. 3.1 of [\citet=Mueller_2012] and in Appendix A of [\citet=Tamborra_2014] and calculate the observable flux, here the number-flux N, from the ray-by-ray-computed number-flux densities, [formula], at points [formula] on the radiating surface by an integration over the visible hemisphere, cf. Eq. (7) in [\citet=Mueller_2012]:

[formula]

Here ϑ is the zenith angle at point [formula] on the radiating sphere, i.e., the angle between the normal vector of the surface element [formula] and the observer direction. An analogous relation pertains to the energy luminosity, L, as a function of the energy-flux densities, [formula],

[formula]

cf. Eq. (5) in [\citet=Mueller_2012]. The integrands of Eqs. ([\ref=eq:applum-n]) and ([\ref=eq:applum-e]) account for projection effects of the radiating surface elements and limb darkening. In the free-streaming limit, the flux density F() declines like R- 2 with distance R  =  || from the source center, while the surface element [formula] ([formula] being the solid angle) increases with R2. Therefore, the product [formula] becomes constant and the integral value is independent of the chosen surface of integration.

Figure [\ref=fig:fluxvariations] shows that in the early phase of postshock convection the directional emission asymmetry remains small. At about 150 ms, however, a stable dipolar pattern emerges and reaches maximum amplitudes of around 10% for νe and 15% for e at roughly 180 ms after bounce. A positive amplitude for νe is correlated with a negative one for e and vice versa, and local maxima (minima) of the νe emission generally coincide in time with minima (maxima) of the e emission. After t  ~  180 ms a slow, overall trend of decay of the dipolar emission asymmetry begins, in agreement with our earlier finding in the lepton-number flux, although the relative strength of the lepton-number asymmetry remains large. Note also that we show here the evolution as observed from a fixed direction so that overall trends of the fluxes can be partly caused by a slight drift of the dipole direction.

The dipole asymmetry is large in the νe and e fluxes, whereas heavy-lepton neutrinos, νx, exhibit at most a few-percent effect. The νx emission is slightly enhanced in the direction of small lepton-number (high e) flux.

Figure [\ref=fig:skymaps11] provides similar information for the 11.2 [formula] model in the form of sky maps for all viewing directions of a distant observer. The temporal stability of the dipole pattern justifies time averaging instead of individual snapshots. In particular, we average over 150-250 ms p.b., when the dipole effect is particularly strong. The left column provides the luminosities, L, for νe, e, νx, as well as νe plus e, and νe minus e, all normalized to their directional maxima except for the difference plot, which is normalized to the all-sky average of Lνe + Le. The right column shows analogous information for the corresponding number fluxes, N.

Both luminosities and number fluxes clearly show the emission dipole (anti-)aligned with the lepton-number dipole axis. While the maximum variation amplitudes of νe and e fluxes are approximately [formula] in the two dipole directions, heavy-lepton neutrinos show just about ±  2% variations. In contrast to the individual luminosities and number fluxes, the sums Lνe + Le and Nνe + Ne, vary only on the few-percent level. We also note that the relative variation of the energy-flux difference, Lνe - Le, is a bit smaller than the hemispheric variation of the number-flux difference Nνe - Ne. Most importantly, while the former can be positive or negative, the latter is positive in all directions. This shift of the asymmetry variation in the luminosity difference corresponds to considerably larger e energies relative to νe.

In contrast, the 27 [formula] run with its episodes of strong SASI shock sloshing and spiralling motions (see [\citealt=Hanke_2013]) exhibits large-amplitude, quasiperiodic neutrino emission modulations with dipolar asymmetry in all flavors [\citep=Tamborra_2013] [\citep=Tamborra_2014]. In addition, however, the 27 [formula] model also shows a steady lepton-number emission dipole, i.e., a long-lasting and non-oscillating dipole in the lepton-number flux (νe minus e). We present a sky-map of the e number flux as well as the total νe plus e flux in Fig. [\ref=fig:skymaps27]. To avoid any confusion with SASI activity, we show a time-averaged signal here as seen by a distant observer taken between the two episodes of SASI activity, i.e., integrated over the p.b. interval of 260-360 ms. In qualitative agreement with the [formula] case, there is a clear dipole feature in the e flux, whereas in the sum flux the dipole variation is weak--the individual νe and e fluxes are again anti-correlated.

The LESA dipole directions of our three stellar models do not show any correlation with each other (cf. Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11]), and they are uncorrelated with the numerical grid. Moreover, the LESA dipole direction has no clear correlation with the main direction of SASI sloshing or with the plane of SASI spiralling motions. Figure [\ref=fig:lesasasisky] displays the evolution of the SASI and LESA directions during the first SASI-dominated phases of the 20[formula] and 27[formula] models (170-300 ms and 170-260 ms, respectively). In the former case, the LESA dipole direction is clearly far outside of the plane defined by the movements of the SASI shock-deformation vector (implying that the LESA dipole vector and the normal vector of the SASI plane are nearly aligned), while in the latter case the LESA dipole happens to be close to the SASI plane. This suggests that the relative orientations of SASI and of the lepton-number emission dipole are chosen randomly and that both effects are independent phenomena. Nevertheless, both seem to be able to influence each other as we will discuss later (Sect. [\ref=sec:modelswithsasi]).

Radial evolution of the emission dipole

We next investigate the spatial origin of the lepton-number flux asymmetry. To this end we consider the evolutionary stage at 210 ms p.b. of the [formula] model when the lepton-number dipole has reached a large value. Figure [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry1] shows the radial evolution of the lepton-number (νe minus e) flux for the two hemispheres where it is maximal and minimal, respectively. The integration avoids any projection or observer effects--the sum of the two hemispheric values yields the total lepton-number flux traversing a spherical shell of given radius. It is intriguing that most of the hemispheric difference builds up in the PNS mantle layer below the (average) neutrinosphere, which is located here at around 35 km. At this radius, the lepton-flux difference has nearly reached its asymptotic value, whereas only about 20-25% (or 3-4  ×  1055  s- 1) arise at larger radii and are therefore more directly associated with the hemispheric asymmetry of the accretion flow (cf. Sect. [\ref=sec:mass-accretion]).

A different way of visualizing the radial evolution of the lepton-number flux is to study it along individual radial "rays" of our transport scheme. To this end we have performed a cut of our [formula] model in a plane containing the dipole direction at 210 ms p.b. Figure [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry3] shows the result with a color coding corresponding to the radial lepton-number flux as a function of location in this cut plane. The downward direction in the plots is the direction of maximum lepton-number flux. It is apparent that this hemisphere shows stronger convection inside the PNS than the other hemisphere. The flux asymmetry arises far below the average neutrinosphere, here indicated by a white circle.

Most of the overall lepton-number emission (the monopole of the emission distribution) builds up in the envelope (i.e., the neutrino-cooling) region above the NS and is fed by the accretion downflows of lepton-rich material, whereas most of the dipole builds up around the PNS convection zone deep inside the NS and below the neutrinosphere. While the accretion flow also shows a dipole asymmetry as we will see, it is not responsible for the main effect of the asymmetry of the lepton-number emission.

Asymmetry of electron density distribution

Most of the lepton number stored in the PNS and its accretion layer is in the form of electrons, whereas it is emitted in the form of a νe-e number-flux difference. Therefore, it is instructive to inspect the electron density distribution in those regions of the PNS where the lepton-flux dipolar asymmetry originates. Figure [\ref=fig:yecuts] shows color-coded Ye distributions of the 11.2 [formula] model in cut planes containing the dipole axis in analogy to Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry3] and with the same orientation, i.e., bottom is the hemisphere of largest lepton-number emission. We also show iso-density contours as white circles--the density stratification is perfectly spherical and concentric around the center of mass (which essentially coincides with the coordinate origin) because of the extreme strength of the gravity field of the PNS. The outermost contour, corresponding to 3  ×  1011 g cm- 3, is somewhat interior to the average neutrinosphere.

The four different postbounce moments correspond to the ones shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:leptonskyplots] and span the time when the lepton-emission dipole begins to form (148 ms p.b.) all the way to a time when it is fully developed, but still before any noticeable decay takes place (240 ms). We see the development of a more electron-depleted region in the upper hemisphere, where a smaller lepton-number flux originates, while the bottom hemisphere, where a larger lepton-number flux originates, exhibits more electron-rich material. The growth of the hemispheric asymmetry of the lepton distribution in the PNS mantle region below the neutrinosphere is clearly visible as the compact remnant deleptonizes and contracts between t  ~  150 ms (top left) and t  =  210 ms (bottom left). At around this later time the most extreme hemispheric difference is reached with an electron fraction difference of up to ΔYe  ~  0.03-0.06 on some density levels. As time and lepton emission progress, the hemispheric differences tend to decrease (bottom right).

The asymmetry of the Ye distribution not only explains the emission dipoles of νe and e, it also explains why the number flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos, νx, is somewhat amplified (on the percent level) in the direction of the smaller lepton-number flux, which is the direction of stronger e emission (cf. Figs. [\ref=fig:fluxvariations] and [\ref=fig:skymaps11]). Because the annihilation of e+e- and νee pairs yields important contributions to the νx number flux, in particular at lower densities (whereas at high densities the production by nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung dominates; see [\citealt=Raffelt_2001] [\citealt=Buras_2003] [\citealt=Keil_2003] for details), the larger positron and e abundances on this side of the PNS also foster the emission of heavy-lepton neutrinos.

Driving Mechanism of LESA

Asymmetry of mass-accretion flow

The lepton-flux asymmetry originates deep inside the PNS, below the neutrinosphere, and several phenomenological observations form a consistent picture, e.g., the lepton-emission asymmetry, the PNS convection asymmetry, the asymmetric Ye distribution, and the small νx emission asymmetry. However, these manifestations do not yet provide a hydrodynamical explanation of how these effects first arise and then stabilize themselves in a long-lasting, only slowly evolving pattern. Moreover, the initial growth of the dipole distribution over 100-150 ms is parallel to the growth of convective overturn in the gain region below the stalled shock wave.

The most plausible physical connection between the asymmetries deep in the PNS and hydrodynamical properties of the envelope derives from asymmetric mass-accretion flows. To study this hypothesis we consider the time evolution of the mass accretion flow in our usual two hemispheres defined by maximal and minimal lepton-number emission, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry] for all three considered progenitors (top row). At a time when the dipole begins to form in earnest, we notice a significant hemispheric asymmetry of the mass accretion rate such that the hemisphere of larger lepton-number flux also has the systematically larger mass accretion rate.

This flow fluctuates strongly because of convective perturbations and (in the 20 and 27 [formula] models) SASI mass motions, but on average exhibits a time-dependent anisotropy of 30-50% for the 11.2 [formula] case and of 10-25% for the other two progenitors. On average it carries considerably more fresh lepton number to the central compact object on one side than on the other. The lepton-rich flow partially deleptonizes by neutrino emission before it spreads out below the PNS surface to settle into the PNS mantle, but it is still more lepton-rich than the deleptonized material that is already present in this region. Because it is specifically lighter (containing a higher number fraction of electrons and protons instead of heavier neutrons), the lepton-rich gas does not efficiently mix with the deleptonized plasma. Instead, it accumulates on one side of the PNS and pushes the more deleptonized fluid out of the way, towards the opposite hemisphere.

The full explanation for the Ye distribution is actually even more complex. The accretion inflow of lepton number cannot explain the entire Ye asymmetry in the PNS mantle. On the one hand, the accretion downflows deleptonize nearly identically during their infall from different directions, fairly independently of the local mass-flux density in the convective downdrafts that carry the accretion flow towards the PNS. Some of the greenish areas in the lower hemisphere of Fig. [\ref=fig:yecuts], which have no counterpart on the upper side, have possibly inherited their electons from accretion flows. However, the red, orange and yellow bulges, which reach outward from the dense, high-Ye core most prominently in the lower hemisphere, cannot come from the same origin. They are located in the convective shell of the PNS, which is interior to the neutrinospheres, and they thus suggest an enhanced efficiency of the convective lepton-number transport out from the inner core. The convective region inside of the PNS can be recognized as a circular ring of short-wavelength color variations between ~  12 km and ~  25 km in the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry3]. This region is more pronounced in the lower hemisphere, indicating stronger PNS convection effects in this direction, by which lepton number is pulled up from the central, lepton-rich high-density core. This dredge-up explains the presence of high-Ye patches (red, orange, and yellow in Fig. [\ref=fig:yecuts]) extending outward from the inner core region.

Convective activity inside the PNS is constrained to a shell that surrounds the convectively stable core. The size of the convection cells is roughly defined by the radial scale of the active layer. Therefore, a volume-filling convective dipole mode is absent and the formation of a low-mode dipolar asymmetry of the lepton transport is puzzling. This argument supports a driving mechanism connected to the global accretion asymmetry. It seems that convective transport of lepton (electron) number in the deeper PNS mantle region might be amplified when accretion downflows impinge into the PNS, presumably because shear flows, turbulence, and gravity waves, which are instigated in the outer layers of the PNS mantle as a consequence of such violent impacts, can act in a destabilizing way on convectively nearly neutral or marginally stable statifications. Also the contraction of the PNS might play an important role during the growth phase of the dipole mode. Postshock overturn develops in parallel to a phase of strong PNS contraction. Since the NS mantle layer settles to increasing densities, convection cannot reach a steady state in which perturbations connected to the impact of accretion downflows may be washed out on the typical timescales of small-scale lepton transport. Instead, hemispheric asymmetries imprinted at early times, when matter still resides at low densities with short restoring timescales, may be carried to higher densities and thus may get frozen in for much longer periods, becoming the initial seeds for a subsequent growth towards the global dipolar asymmetry. A more detailed analysis of the dynamical interaction of accretion stream impacts in the outer layers of the PNS and convection in the contracting PNS mantle is deferred to future work.

The low-mode dipolar asymmetry of the lepton-number distribution in the PNS is therefore a consequence of the strong gravity, which on the one hand tends to spread out flows and to smoothen structures along equipotential surfaces and on the other hand defines an environment where buoyancy effects play an extremely important role.

Asymmetry of gain-layer convection and shock-wave radius

One may wonder if the asymmetric accretion flow has a visible correspondence in the structure of the large-scale convection in the gain region. To investigate this question we show in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropycuts] entropy distributions of the 11.2 [formula] model in the same cut planes that were used in Fig. [\ref=fig:yecuts] for the Ye distribution, i.e., the plane contains the dipole direction and downward is the direction of maximum lepton-number flux. In contrast to the clear hemispheric differences of the mass accretion rate in the postshock layer (Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry], top left panel), associated differences in the region of convective overturn are not clearly visible in the entropy cuts or in the earlier visualizations of Fig. [\ref=fig:3dconv11]. A closer inspection of the entropy cuts (Fig. [\ref=fig:entropycuts]) reveals that in the lower two panels (t = 210 and 240 ms p.b.) the convective plumes are bigger and push the shock to a slightly larger radius in the upper hemisphere. Moreover, the convective downdrafts that carry the accretion flow to the PNS are more numerous (lower left panel) and the flow close to the PNS is more vigorous (lower right panel) on the opposite side. Because the convective mass motions are highly turbulent and time variable, however, one should be cautious with conclusions based on selected snapshots.

To be more quantitative, the average shock radii in both hemispheres are shown in the middle panel (left column) of Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry]. Indeed, from ~  150 ms onwards a clear and persistent difference, aside from fluctuations, of 10-20 km (6-7% of the average shock radius) is found.

The one-sided increase of the average shock-wave radius is actually the physical cause for the accretion-flow asymmetry, because the spherical infall from larger radial distances is deflected and channelled preferentially toward the hemisphere of smaller shock-wave radius. One should notice the anti-correlation between mass-accretion flow and shock-wave radius in Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry]--the hemisphere of increased accretion flow (black line) is the hemisphere of reduced shock-wave radius. It is important in this context to remember that the preshock accretion flow is spherically symmetric except for imposed, small-scale random perturbations.

Asymmetry of neutrino-heating rates

But how can this dipolar shock deformation be maintained in a persistent and long-lasting manner despite vigorous convection behind the shock? Here an interesting, self-sustaining feedback mechanism comes into play, in which the lepton-emission dipole asymmetry itself facilitates, supports, and stabilizes the conditions for its existence. The key point is that the lepton-flux asymmetry implies a neutrino-heating rate asymmetry in the gain region below the shock. In particular, the heating rate is larger in the hemisphere of smaller lepton-number flux (red lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry]), which is the hemisphere of more vigorous gain-region convection and increased shock-wave radius. In the bottom panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry] we show volume-integrated heating rates in the gain layers of both hemispheres as functions of time, and indeed there is a systematic offset between the two hemispheres. Stronger neutrino heating leads to more powerful convective buoyancy and this naturally pushes the radius of the stalled shock farther out in one hemisphere compared to the opposite hemisphere, where the neutrino-energy deposition is weaker. So in the hemisphere of small lepton-number flux we have an increased heating rate, increased shock-wave radius, reduced mass-accretion flow, and therefore reduced lepton-number flux.

In order to further discuss the heating asymmetry we now consider the characteristic spectral properties of the radiated neutrinos for our 11.2 [formula] model. The e are emitted by the PNS with significantly higher average energies than νe. Typically, 〈εe〉 exceeds 〈ενe〉 by 3-3.5 MeV, averaged over all emission directions as illustrated by Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoemission]. These spectral differences also exist separately in both hemispheres, and they manifest themselves also in the rms energies as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry2], where we display the emitted energy spectra for our previous 210 ms snapshot of the [formula] model. Comparing the radiated energy spectra of νe, e, and νx on two selected radial rays close to the directions of maximal (black) and minimal lepton-number flux (red), the spectra differ primarily in the normalizations, whereas the spectral shapes are very similar (Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry2]). Correspondingly, the rms energies, indicated by tick marks at the upper edge of the plot, are 15.6, 19.1 and 20.3 MeV for νe, e and νx, respectively, in the direction of maximum lepton-number flux, and very similar values of 15.8, 18.9 and 20.6 MeV are found in the opposite direction. The normalized moments of the energy spectra for each neutrino type are nearly identical in both hemispheres.

The increased heating rate in the hemisphere of small lepton-number flux (more similar νe and e number fluxes) can now be understood as follows. For the dominant processes of νe absorption on free neutrons and e absorption on free protons the heating rate per nucleon can be approximated by (cf. [\citealt=Janka_2001])

[formula]

where σ0 is the normalizing cross section, r- 2 describes the radial flux dilution far away from the neutrinosphere, Yn and Yp are the number fractions of free neutrons and protons, respectively, Lν stands for the neutrino luminosities, and 〈ε2ν〉 denotes the squared rms energy of the energy flux. Since e are radiated with higher rms energies, the neutrino heating will be stronger in the hemisphere where the e number emission is relatively enhanced, despite the nearly isotropic luminosity sum of νe plus e. The effect is amplified by the fact that in this hemisphere, the e energy flux even exceeds that of νe (cf. Fig. [\ref=fig:skymaps11], lower left panel).

Quantitatively, the numerical difference between the heating rates in the two hemispheres seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry] (bottom left panel) is roughly 5%. This finding can easily be verified by estimating the ratio of the heating rates between the directions of low and high lepton-number flux, [formula]. Using Eq. ([\ref=eq:heatingrate]), assuming Yp and Yn to vary little with direction, and adopting a ratio of the squared rms energies of 〈ε2e〉  /  〈ε2νe〉  ≈  1.46 in both hemispheres (Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry2]) as well as amplitudes of 10-15% for the dipolar asymmetry of the νe and e energy fluxes (Figs. [\ref=fig:fluxvariations] and [\ref=fig:skymaps11]), we obtain [formula]-1.06. The numerical results in the bottom panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry] are based on an integration over the volumes of the gain layer in both hemispheres while these hemispheres were moved with the slowly wandering direction of the LESA dipole.

Asymmetries in models with SASI activity

As expected from the fact that the neutrino emission exhibits all the characteristic LESA features also in our 20 and 27 [formula] models, the hemispheric asymmetries described above mostly for the 11.2 [formula] case are also found in the other two progenitors (Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry]). However, the SASI mass motions in these cases lead to short-timescale neutrino-emission modulations superimposed on the dipolar lepton emission asymmetry (see [\citealt=Tamborra_2014]), and the large-amplitude SASI-induced variations of the postshock accretion flow can mask the global, hemispheric differences of the mass accretion rate, shock radius, and neutrino-heating rate associated with the LESA phenomenon during the phases of strong SASI activity.

This problem for the analysis is more conspicuous for the 27 [formula] simulation (Fig. [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry], right column), where the higher mass accretion rate, smaller shock radius and neutrino heating rate in the hemisphere of excess νe flux are clearly visible only during the SASI-quiet episodes, i.e. before 170 ms and between 260 ms and 420 ms. In constrast, the familiar hemispheric asymmetries of these quantities can be seen at essentially all times in the 20 [formula] model, despite the violent SASI in the time interval from 170 ms to 305 ms.

This difference between both models is connected to the different relative orientations of the SASI plane and the LESA dipole vector in these models during the first SASI episodes (cf. Fig. [\ref=fig:lesasasisky]). While in the 27 [formula] model the LESA dipole lies in the plane of the SASI spiralling, it is nearly orthogonal to the SASI plane in the 20 [formula] case. In the former model the mass-accretion, gain-layer convection, and heating asymmetries described in Sects. [\ref=sec:mass-accretion]-[\ref=sec:neutrino_heating] are therefore strongly perturbed by the violent mass flows associated with the SASI, whereas in the 20 [formula] model these hemispheric asymmetries seem to be less affected by the SASI flows because they proceed in the direction perpendicular to the SASI plane. It is important to note that usually also during SASI-active phases convective overturn as a consequence of neutrino heating is still present.

Therefore SASI mass motions in the postshock layer interfere with the LESA phenomenon in different ways, depending on the orientation of the LESA direction relative to the plane of SASI sloshing and spiralling. If the lepton-emission dipole happens to coincide with the SASI plane the violent modulations of the postshock accretion flow by the SASI seem to be able to prevent further growth of the LESA dipole (cf. Sect. [\ref=sec:dipole-time]) and to enforce a gradual drift of the dipole direction, see the right panels of Figs. [\ref=fig:dipole11] and [\ref=fig:lesasasisky] for the first SASI phase (between 170 and 260 ms p.b.) of our 27 [formula] model. If, in contrast, the LESA vector is incidentally perpendicular to the SASI plane, the growth of the LESA amplitude is not impeded and the LESA direction may describe quasi-periodic wobbling around a mean orientation, see the SASI-active episode of our 20 [formula] simulation from 170 ms to 305 ms in the middle panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11] and the left panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:lesasasisky]. The LESA-SASI interference is therefore complex and any behavior intermediate between these extrema might be possible.

Overall Picture of the LESA Phenomenon

Two interlocking cycles

From our discussion so far a picture of the LESA phenomenon emerges that involves a machinery consisting of two major interacting parts. One consists of asymmetric PNS convection and concomitant asymmetric lepton-number emission. The other consists of asymmetric mass-accretion regulated by asymmetric neutrino emission through asymmetric neutrino heating in the gain layer.

We re-capitulate and summarize the cog-wheels of this machinery in the sketch of Fig. [\ref=fig:cartoon]. It is oriented in the same way as our previous cut-planes, i.e., the lepton-number emission maximum is in the downward direction. In our line plots, black curves correspond to properties in the downward direction or lower hemisphere, red curves to the upward direction (or hemisphere), which is the hemisphere of minimal lepton-number flux emission.

In the inner parts of Fig. [\ref=fig:cartoon], the mass center is marked by a black dot, surrounded by concentric red circular regions which show the density stratification inside the newly formed NS. The long-dashed line indicates the location of the neutrinosphere(s). Blue circles represent levels of constant electron fraction (Ye). The upward displacement of the light-blue region visualizes schematically a dipolar asymmetry of the deleptonization in the NS mantle region enclosed by the neutrinosphere: While in the top hemisphere the layer below the neutrinosphere has deleptonized more strongly due to the preceding and ongoing emission of electron neutrinos (the light-blue region there is bigger), the bottom hemisphere contains a larger fraction of electrons (indicated by the larger red area).

This dipolar asymmetry of the Ye distribution in the PNS mantle is a consequence of a pronounced hemispheric difference in the mass flow towards the compact object. The latter accretes matter at a significantly higher rate on one side and thus receives a greater inflow of fresh lepton number in this hemisphere (bottom in Fig. [\ref=fig:cartoon]). Even more important, however, is an indirect effect connected with the mass accretion. As the accretion streams impinge onto the PNS they instigate turbulence and gravity waves, which enhance convection in the deeper mantle layers of the PNS, dredging up electrons from the central, lepton-rich dense core (visualized in Fig. [\ref=fig:cartoon] by the larger convective loops in the lower hemisphere). Lepton number carried away by the outgoing neutrino fluxes is therefore replenished by electrons delivered by accretion downdrafts as well as those pulled outward in convective flows that reach deeper into the PNS core. Since the underlying processes are nonisotropic and more efficient in one hemisphere, the deleptonized mantle layer of the PNS exhibits a long-lasting dipolar asymmetry of the Ye distribution.

The anisotropic accretion flow towards the PNS is indicated by the two red accretion-stream lines. Such an accretion asymmetry in the convectively stirred postshock layer should be understood in a time-averaged sense, emerging effectively from a strongly fluctuating accretion-flow pattern. The convective activity in the region between gain radius (short-dashed line) and shock is symbolized by the up- and downgoing loops for the convective overturn motions of rising and sinking gas. The accretion asymmetry is caused by a dipolar shock deformation, which--again in a time-averaged sense--is associated with a larger radius of the accretion shock (thick, black outer ellipsoidal line) in the upper hemisphere. This leads to a deflection of the radial accretion flow when the collapsing matter crosses the shock front, because the tangential velocity component is conserved whereas the perpendicular velocity component is reduced by the flow deceleration according to the shock-jump conditions. The deflection of the postshock flow feeds, on average, the lower PNS hemisphere with a higher mass accretion rate.

In this picture, the dipole asymmetry of the neutrino lepton-number flux is a self-sustained, self-stabilizing phenomenon, because the different spectral properties of νe and e ensure more efficient neutrino heating on the side of the lower mass accretion rate and thus lower radiated lepton-number flux. Stronger heating in this hemisphere supports stronger convection and a greater shock radius, thus maintaining the shock deformation that is responsible for the deflection of the accretion flow and the enhanced mass accretion rate reaching the opposite side of the PNS. Neutrinos therefore play a crucial role in this nonradial instability, which leads to a long-lasting, stable asphericity of the postbounce accretion situation.

Memory effect in the PNS

The LESA effect is not "switched off" by the appearance of strong SASI activity, a surprising finding because one might imagine that violent sloshing and spiral modes could interrupt the feedback loop which is the driving cause for LESA. However, LESA has substantial inertia built into its machinery, where the Ye distribution and related PNS convection asymmetry play the role of a flywheel that keeps going even if the driving engine has been temporarily disabled. Once SASI has subsided, the continuing asymmetric lepton emission from the PNS region quickly restarts the engine and puts the feedback loop back into operation. This picture is not necessarily contradicted by the observation that the onset of SASI can considerably shift the LESA dipole direction as seen, for example, after 170 ms p.b. in the [formula] model (bottom right panel in Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11]). In fact, if our picture of an outer feedback loop coupled to asymmetric mass accretion is correct, one would expect that massive, large-scale perturbations of the postshock accretion flow like those connected to the onset and presence of violent SASI episodes can lead to a drift of the direction of the lepton-emission dipole. Similarly, it does not appear astonishing that vigorous, strongly time-dependent convective overturn activity in the neutrino-heating layer creates stochastic variations and fluctuations that can be strong enough to induce a gradual, slow movement of the LESA dipole on secular timescales.

How long can the PNS memory effect last? The life time of the Ye asymmetry in the PNS depends on two competing effects, on the one hand the inflow of fresh electron number in the asymmetric accretion flow and caused by convective transport out of the high-density PNS core, and on the other hand the loss of lepton number by the anisotropic lepton fluxes, which strive for destroying the hemispheric Ye asymmetry. The temporal decay of this asymmetry in the PNS mantle can therefore be approximately described by the following differential equation:

[formula]

where ΔYe is the difference of the electron fraction in the two hemispheres within a shell of mass [formula], [formula] is the mass-accretion rate difference (which we assume to carry an excess lepton fraction of ΔYe into the PNS mantle, [formula] is the rate of electron-number change associated with enhanced convective mixing, ΔN the neutrino-lepton flux difference between both hemispheres, and [formula] the baryon mass. Equation ([\ref=eq:dipoledecay]) yields a rough estimate of the decay timescale:

[formula]

In this expression we have ignored the positive contributions on the rhs of Eq. ([\ref=eq:dipoledecay]) because the first term turns out to be subdominant when numbers from the 11.2 [formula] simulation (ΔYe  ~  0.05, [formula] s- 1, cf. Figs. [\ref=fig:yecuts] and [\ref=fig:accretionasymmetry]) are used, and the second term is difficult to calculate without digging into the details of the dynamic interaction between the PNS convection and the impact of accretion flows on the PNS. In any case, the inflow of fresh lepton number associated with the positive source term can only stretch the decay timescale so that our estimate provides a firm lower limit. With numbers deduced from our analysis of the 11.2 [formula] model, [formula], ΔYe  ~  0.05 (Fig. [\ref=fig:yecuts]), and ΔN  ~  12  ×  1055 s- 1 (Fig. [\ref=fig:neutrinoasymmetry1]), we obtain [formula] ms. Therefore, once the lepton-emission dipole has developed to its full strength, it will continue to exist for at least 100 ms even if the asymmetries of accretion and PNS convection disappear.

Summary and outlook

In this paper we have described a new type of nonradial deformation mode that we discovered in our 3D stellar core-collapse simulations using energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino transport, applied to progenitor stars of 11.2, 20, and 27 [formula]. During the first 100-150 ms of postbounce evolution, a long-lasting, only slowly evolving dipolar neutrino-emission asymmetry establishes itself. It persists throughout the postbounce accretion phase of the stalled SN shock for hundreds of ms, even in those models that show violent SASI activity for parts of their postbounce evolution. This multi-dimensional phenomenon has not been identified unambiguously in any previous 2D simulation. We call the new phenomenon LESA for "Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry." LESA emerges from an instability, i.e., the spherically symmetric state is not stable and the asymmetry grows from any perturbation, no matter how small. In contrast to convection or SASI, the nature of LESA is not simply hydrodynamical, but rather a neutrino-hydrodynamical instability and as such the first of its kind identified in the SN context.

The dipole mode manifests itself most conspicuously in the lepton-number flux (νe minus e), whose dipole amplitude can reach 100% of its 4π directional average, i.e., in one direction the lepton-number flux can exceed twice the average, in the opposite direction it can be even somewhat negative (e number flux exceeds that of νe). While dipole amplitudes of the individual νe and e number and energy fluxes of 10-20% can be observed in our 3D calculations of the 11.2 [formula] progenitor (and somewhat smaller ones in the 27 [formula] model), heavy-lepton neutrinos as well as the sum of νe and e exhibit only percent-level dipolar luminosity asymmetries.

The neutrino-emission dipole originates from a hemispheric asymmetry of the electron distribution in the mantle layer of the PNS interior to the neutrinospheres, although the density stratification is perfectly spherical and concentric in these regions of extreme gravitational field strength. In the hemisphere of higher νe flux, convection in the deeper layers of the PNS mantle is enhanced compared to the opposite side and dredges up electrons more efficiently from the dense, lepton-rich central core. These electrons are mixed outward towards the neutrinospheres and lead to less deleptonized conditions in one hemisphere, supporting the higher νe flux. The convective activity seems to be instigated and fostered by shear flows, turbulent motions, and gravity waves caused by the violent impacts of accretion streams in the neutrinospheric region. This connection is suggested by the observed correlation between PNS-convection asymmetry and a considerable asymmetry of the mass-accretion flow, which is stronger in the hemisphere of enhanced PNS convection. The accretion asymmetry also contributes to the lepton-number emission dipole, because the accretion streams carry electron-rich matter and thus supply the PNS with fresh lepton number, but this effect is subdominant.

The global accretion asymmetry is maintained by anisotropic neutrino heating in the gain layer behind the stalled SN shock, because e leave the neutrinosphere with higher mean energy than νe. Therefore, neutrino heating is stronger on the side of lower lepton-number flux, despite the nearly isotropic energy flux of νe plus e. Stronger neutrino heating enhances convective overturn in the postshock layer, pushes the shock to a larger stagnation radius and thus produces a dipolar deformation of the shock surface. This shock deformation in turn deflects the accretion flow falling through the shock and, in the time-averaged sense, amplifies the accretion flux to the hemisphere of the PNS facing away from the greater shock radius (Fig. [\ref=fig:cartoon]).

Anisotropic neutrino heating therefore establishes a feedback mechanism between the neutrino-emission asymmetry on one side and shock deformation and accretion asymmetry on the other. It thus mediates a complex, mutual dependence between lepton-number transport by neutrino fluxes and convection inside the PNS on the one hand and anisotropic convective overturn in the gain layer on the other. This feedback, which involves neutrinos as crucial players, allows the global dipolar asymmetry to become a self-sustained phenomenon, which exists in stable conditions over many dynamical timescales despite the presence of vigorous and highly time-dependent convective overturn in the postshock region and even through phases of violent SASI activity. Stochastic fluctuations of this convective overturn or of the convection in the PNS mantle are probably responsible for initiating the development of the hemispheric asymmetry. The convective SN core seems to be generically unstable against such a dipolar mode of asymmetry. LESA and SASI are independent phenomena, but the latter can influence the former in a complex manner, depending on the relative orientations of the associated vector directions.

LESA could have important implications for a variety of physical processes in the SN core, most importantly nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-heated ejecta, and potentially NS kicks and neutrino-flavor conversion.

Concerning nucleosynthesis, we recall that charged-current reactions of νe and e with neutrons and protons do not only heat the SN blast wave but also set the n/p ratio in the neutrino-driven outflow and thus determine the nucleosynthesis conditions in the innermost SN ejecta. Since νe absorption converts neutrons to protons while e captured on protons create neutrons, the exposure to a higher flux of e tends to neutronize the expelled matter. The lepton-number emission asymmetry could persist until the explosion sets in or even beyond, fuelled by continued anisotropic PNS convection and/or asymmetric accretion beyond the onset of the explosion. In this case a considerable hemispheric asymmetry of the electron fraction in the ejecta could be expected with possibly favorable conditions for neutron-rich material in the direction where the e flux has its emission maximum. We speculate that the O-Ne-Mg core explosion of [\citet=Wanajo_2011], where convective overturn but not SASI played a role, may be a case where we have encountered consequences of the dipolar lepton-emission asymmetry in a 2D model. The moderate hemispheric differences of Ye in the early neutrino-driven wind (with variations in the range [formula]) in this simulation might give an impression of the corresponding effects that could be obtained in future 3D explosions.

Asymmetric neutrino emission imparts a recoil on the nascent NS. We assume a dipolar emission anisotropy of the total neutrino-energy loss rate (the summed contributions of ν and [formula] of all flavors),

[formula]

where α is the dipole amplitude and ϑ the zenith angle relative to the dipole direction. In this case the NS acceleration is

[formula]

With [formula] and [formula]) we obtain

[formula]

If α  ~  0.01-0.02 and the duration of the emission asymmetry lasts only some hundred milliseconds, corresponding to the duration of the accretion phase, the recoil velocity will not exceed several 10 km s- 1, depending on the time-integrated neutrino-energy release [formula]. But the NS kick velocity could reach 100-200 km s- 1 for a canonical value of 3  ×  1053  erg for the NS gravitational binding energy, if the neutrino-emission dipole continues to exist for the whole period of PNS neutrino cooling. With the luminosity maximum coinciding with the e emission peak in our 3D simulations, the NS acceleration will point in the direction of the strongest νe emission. Even in the optimistic (and highly speculative) case that the neutrino-emission dipole survives for seconds, however, the estimated recoil velocity is dwarfed by those that can typically be expected from the "gravitational tug-boat mechanism" associated with the anisotropic ejection of matter in 3D simulations of SN explosions [\citep=Wongwathanarat_2010] [\citep=Wongwathanarat_2013].

Another small but amusing mechanical consequence of LESA is an angular momentum transfer, i.e., a spin-up of the nascent NS. Weak interactions violate parity maximally, implying that a relativistic νe has negative helicity and carries the spin angular momentum -   relative to its direction of motion, whereas a e has positive helicity and carries +  . We denote the lepton-number flux dipole amplitude with ADipole, i.e., the quantity plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:dipole11]. The angular momentum transfer rate then has the magnitude

[formula]

because our normalization of the dipole amplitude implies that it is three times the total lepton-number flux projected on the dipole direction. With a typical value [formula] and recalling that [formula] we find a typical angular-momentum transfer rate of [formula]. We recall that the moment of inertia of a homogeneous sphere with mass M and radius R is I = 2MR2 / 5 and its angular momentum is J = I  2πf with f the rotation frequency. Using as benchmark values [formula] and R = 15  km, a typical PNS spin-up rate is of the order of [formula], a very small value indeed. A much larger effect, however, is non-radial neutrino emission that can transfer orbital angular momentum and cause a spin-down of a rotating NS as first shown by [\citet=Mikaelian_1977] and [\citet=Epstein_1978].

Our entire study has ignored neutrino flavor conversion. The LESA phenomenon depends on a subtle hemispheric asymmetry of neutrino heating rates. Certainly this effect would be modified if the νe and e fluxes would partially swap flavor with νx and x which have different spectral properties and different number fluxes. Moreover, flavor conversion also modifies the neutrino influence on the n/p ratio in the context of nucleosynthesis as first pointed out by [\citet=Qian_1993] and [\citet=Qian_1995].

The thorniest problem in the context of neutrino flavor conversion is the role of neutrino-neutrino refraction, which causes many complications because of the feedback of flavor conversion on itself [\citep=Duan_2010]. The justification for ignoring flavor conversion in the dense region below the stalled shock wave is the so-called multi-angle matter effect, which tends to suppress self-induced flavor conversion [\citep=Esteban_2008] [\citep=Sarikas_2012] [\citep=Raffelt_2013] [\citep=Chakraborty_2011] [\citep=Saviano_2012] [\citep=Chakraborty_2014]. In particular, [\citet=Dasgupta_2012] have studied the onset of self-induced flavor conversion in a somewhat simplified 3D model. These authors conclude that flavor conversion always begins outside the shock wave.

It is conceivable, however, that these conclusions must be modified in the LESA context, notably in those directions where the lepton number flux is small. The asymmetry between the νe and e number fluxes, sometimes denoted with the parameter ε, is a crucial ingredient for the stability of the neutrino flux in flavor space [\citep=Esteban_2007]. Moreover, the LESA phenomenon also modifies the electron-density profile which defines the matter effect for neutrino flavor oscillations. Therefore, it remains to be verified that flavor conversion is indeed irrelevant for the LESA phenomenon.

The observations reported in this paper raise many interesting questions. It is obvious that the LESA phenomenon needs much more work and analysis to develop a full understanding, especially concerning how asymmetric PNS convection is stimulated by asymmetric mass accretion and how SASI and LESA interact. Many of our explanations remain tentative and require further confirmation.

In particular, further studies are necessary to reveal how generic the lepton-number emission dipole is. How exactly does its amplification work, what is the underlying mechanism? What is the role of the PNS contraction in this context, and, if it is important, how sensitive is the phenomenon to the nuclear equation of state and the neutrino opacities? How big is the saturation amplitude of LESA and what does it depend on? Could its amplitude be larger than in our present 3D simulations and could its dipolar neutrino-heating asymmetry affect the onset of neutrino-driven SN explosions? How long does LESA last? Does LESA require the inner engine of hemispherically asymmetric PNS convection as a necessary ingredient, or is the role of PNS convection only that of an amplifier of the lepton-number flux asymmetry and that of a stabilizing factor which enables long-term memory? A feedback loop seems possible that is solely based on the outer engine, in which the asymmetric accretion and lepton-number emission on the one hand is intertwined with the dipolar neutrino-heating asymmetry and shock deformation on the other. Answers to these questions are indispensable to reach firm conclusions on the importance of LESA for NS kicks, the explosion mechanism and asymmetries, and SN nucleosynthesis.

Linear growth studies would help to develop deeper insights. It would be especially useful to construct toy models that capture the essential parts of the mechanism but reduce its complexity and thus allow a better control of the interplay of its different components. Such studies would be particularly useful because numerical models are always prone to artifacts. For example, it is unclear whether our findings are affected by approximations involved in our treatment, e.g., the ray-by-ray-plus transport, which does not include nonradial neutrino fluxes, the use of a monopole description of the gravitational potential, or the spherical core of 10 km radius, which fixes the PNS to its location at the grid center. It is therefore essential that other groups investigate their neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations for hints of effects similar to our LESA phenomenon.

Note added. After our work had been circulated in preprint form, the authors of [\citet=Couch_2013a] informed us that they also found LESA features in their 3D models. On the other hand, [\citet=Dolence_2014] do not find any evidence for LESA in their 2D simulations (see their Fig. 11, where they plot the evolution of the dipole-to-monopole ratio for the lepton-number flux). Performing a similar analysis for our own 2D models, we do find a strong LESA effect, commensurate with our 3D findings. However, in 2D we see an oscillatory, high-amplitude lepton-flux asymmetry, which can change its north-south orientation on timescales of order 10 ms. This behavior differs from typical features of LESA in 3D, like its persistence and directional stability, and asymmetric accretion and heating are difficult to diagnose in such a strongly time-variable situation. While a more detailed future study of our 2D models may shed more light on this question, we conclude that the appearance or not of LESA is not directly related to the dimensionality of the simulation.

One difference between our works is that we treat neutrino transport in the ray-by-ray-plus approximation, an approach also used by [\citet=Couch_2013a], whereas [\citet=Dolence_2014] use a multi-dimensional flux-limited diffusion scheme, leading them to speculate that LESA is an artifact of the ray-by-ray technique. We note, however, that there are numerous other differences, including neutrino interaction rates, and that our 2D models have rather different physical characteristics at comparable epochs, in particular differ strongly in the evolution of the shock radius and actually explode. Understanding the differences in these results requires a systematic study of the influence of all physics inputs and their numerical representation. The ray-by-ray approximation ignores lateral radiative neutrino transport, although it includes, of course, advective transport of neutrinos trapped in the stellar medium (see [\citealt=buras_06a]). It seems rather implausible that lateral radiative diffusion, caused by relatively weak transverse gradients in the PNS, could suppress a global dipole asymmetry that would otherwise occur. Similarly, it is difficult to imagine that the accretion and lepton-emission asymmetries on the largest possible (hemispheric) scale could be wiped out by angular smoothing of the neutrino heating in the gain layer on much smaller scales (cf. [\citealt=Sumiyoshi_2014]). Such findings would be intriguing in their own right. In any case, a satisfactory answer to this question depends on a true physical understanding of the LESA phenomenon and on observing it in simulations where the neutrino treatment does not have the shortcomings of the ray-by-ray-plus approximation.
