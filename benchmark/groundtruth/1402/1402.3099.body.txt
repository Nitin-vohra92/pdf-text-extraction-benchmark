Helices in the Euclidean 5-Space E5

Introduction

The theory of curves is one of the fundamental topics of differential geometry. Some specific curves play important roles in a variation of sciences. As an example, the helix curves can often be seen in the fields of biology and computer technologies along with the daily life, [\cite=Al2]. The classic results in R3 that are related to the helix curves and have so many fields of application, were given by M.A. Lancret in 1802 and by B. de Saint Venant in 1845, [\cite=Br]. There have been many studies related to the slant helices and darboux helices in the Euclidean 3-Space, [\cite=Al2] [\cite=Iz] [\cite=Ku] [\cite=Zp] and some results have been achieved that are related to the helices and B2 slant helix (3rd type slant helix) in the Euclidean 4-Space, [\cite=Ka] [\cite=Tr1] [\cite=Tr2]. Apart from that, while different characterizations have been given for the inclined and non-null inclined curves in the Euclidean 5-Space and Lorentzian space, [\cite=Al1] [\cite=Ba]. Moreover the non-null helices have been examined in the Lorentzian 6-Space and new characterizations have been reached for the Vn slant helix in the n-dimensional Euclidean Space, [\cite=Go] [\cite=Bo].In this study, V3 slant helix and V5 slant helix have been identified and some results have been obtained in the five dimensional Euclidean space E5. Then we have proven that there are no other helices other than V1-helix, V3 slant helix and V5 slant helix in E5.

Preliminaries

Let α:I  ⊂  R  →  E5 be an arbitrary curve in E5. Recall that the curve α is said to be of unit speed curve if 〈α'(s),α'(s)〉  =  1 where 〈,〉 is the standard scalar product in the Euclidean space E5 given by

[formula]

for each [formula]. In particular, the norm of a vector X is given by [formula], [\cite=Ha].Let [formula] be the moving frame along α. The Frenet equations of the curve α are given by

[formula]

where Vi are called ith Frenet vectors and the functions ki are called ith curvatures of the curve α, [\cite=Ha].A regular curve is called a W-curve if it has constant Frenet curvatures, [\cite=Yl].

V1 helices in the five dimensional Euclidean space E5

Let α:I  ⊂  R  →  E5 be a unit speed curve. If the tangent vector V1 of the curve α makes a constant angle with the fixed direction U, then α is either a V1-helix or inclined curve, [\cite=Al1].

Here [formula] expression can be written from the definition 3.1.

Let α be a unit speed regular curve in E5. Then α is a V1-helix if and only if the function,

[formula]

is constant.Furthermore;

[formula]

where θ is the angle between the vectors V1 and U, [\cite=Al1].

Let α be a unit speed regular curve in E5. Then, α is a V1-helix if and only if the following equalities is satisfied

[formula]

and

[formula]

where f is C2-function, [\cite=Al1].

α is a unit speed curve in E5. Then α is a V1-helix if and only if the equation is satisfied.

[formula]

for some constant A and B, [\cite=Al1].

Now, we will examine the helices other than V1-helix in the five dimensional Euclidean space E5.

V3 slant helix (2nd type slant helix) in the five dimensional Euclidean space E5

Let α be a unit speed curve with nonzero curvatures ki,(  1  ≤  i  ≤  4) in E5. If the third unit Frenet vector field V3 of the curve α makes a constant angle φ with the fixed direction U, then α is called a V3-slant helix (or 2nd type slant helix). (Suppose that [formula]).

Let α be a unit speed curve in E5. Then α is a V3 slant helix if and only if [formula] and [formula].

Proof: If α is a V3-slant helix and U is a fixed unit vector, then the following equality can be written as

[formula]

Taking the differential of equation (4.1) with respect to s and using the Frenet equations, we obtain

[formula]

Therefore, U lies on the hyperplane spanned by the Frenet vectors V1,V3 and V5. Then, we reach

[formula]

where, ui  =  ui(s) and u3  =   cos φ  =  cons tan t.The differential of equation (4.2), we have

[formula]

By the above equality, the coefficients Vi are zero for 1  ≤  i  ≤  5. So we get

[formula]

Thus, it is easy to obtain that the coefficients u1,u3 and u5 are given by

[formula]

Since the coefficients u1 and u5 constants, the ratios [formula] and [formula] are constant, respectively. Therefore, if we substitute u1,u3 and u5 in (4.2), we have

[formula]

where [formula].Conversely, while the ratios [formula] and [formula] are constant, we can define the vector U. Since the differential of U is [formula], U is a fixed vector. Furthermore, since 〈V3,U〉  =   cos φ  =  cons tan t, the curve α become V3 slant helix.This completes the proof. Proof: If α is a V3 slant helix, then from the theorem 4.1 we can write

[formula]

and

[formula]

From the Frenet equations, it is easily to see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

.So we have the ratios

[formula]

and

[formula]

are constant.Conversely, if [formula] and [formula], then the ratios [formula] and [formula] are constant. Thus, from Teorem 4.1 α is V3 slant helix. Proof: If α is a W-curve, then the curvatures ki,  1  ≤  i  ≤  4 are constants. Thus, the ratios [formula] and [formula] constant. This shows that α is V3 slant helix from Theorem 4.1.

V5 slant helix (3rd type slant helix) in five dimensional Euclidean space E5

A unit speed curve α:I  ⊂  R  →  E5 is said to be a V5 slant helix (3rd type slant helix ) if the fifth unit Frenet vector field V5 makes a constant angle Ψ with the unit and fixed direction U.

Let α be a unit speed curve in E5. i) α is a V5 slant helix if and only if the function

[formula]

is constant, where [formula]. ii)α is a V5 slant helix if and only if the following equation is satisfied

[formula]

where [formula].

Proof: i) From the above definition 5.1, we give the following

[formula]

If we take the differential of equation (5.1) with respect to s, we obtain

[formula]

Therefore, we may express

[formula]

we know that [formula] and u5  =   cos ψ  =  cons tan tThe differentiation (5.2) gives

[formula]

and from this equation we find

[formula]

Using the above equations, we can form

[formula]

and

[formula]

If we define f  =  f(s) by

[formula]

then the equation (5.3) writes as

[formula]

and equation (5.4) can be written as

[formula]

Therefore, equation (5.2) takes the following form:

[formula]

Since U is a fixed vector, the following expression

[formula]

is obtained as constant.Conversely, if equation (5.8) holds, then the fixed vector U can be defined as

[formula]

In this case [formula] and 〈V5,U〉  =   cos ψ  =  cons tan t. It is clear that α is V5 slant helix. ii) If α is V5 slant helix, then from the proof of theorem 5.1 i), we have

[formula]

Conversely, if the equation (5.6) holds, then the following can be written

[formula]

Since [formula] and 〈V5,U〉  =   cos ψ  =  cons tan t, α becomes V5 slant helix. Proof: Suppose that α is V5 slant helix and the ratio [formula] is constant. So the equation (5.8) becomes constant, that is, the ratio [formula] is found as constant. This means that the curve α is V3 slant helix from theorem 4.1. Proof: It is obvious from result 5.1.

Also it can be examined if there are any other helices other than V1 helix, V3 slant helix and V5 slant helix in E5.

Let α be a unit speed curve in E5. i)There is no fixed direction making a constant angle with the second Frenet vector V2 of the curve α. ii)There is no fixed direction making a constant angle with the fourth Frenet vector V4 of the curve α.

Proof: Let us assume that the second Frenet vector V2 of the unit speed curve α in E5 makes a constant angle with the fixed direction U. So, we can write

[formula]

where β is a constant angle between V2 and U. Differentiating equation (5.9) with respect to s, we obtain

[formula]

This shows that the vector U is perpendicular to the Frenet vectors V1 and V3, so the following can be written

[formula]

Differentiating the equation (5.10), we have

[formula]

which leads to the following system

[formula]

By taking account of the equations (5.11) we get u2  =  u4  =  u5  =  0 which gives us that [formula].Moreover, this shows that there is no fixed direction U that makes a constant angle with the Frenet vector V2. ii) The proof is similar to the proof of theorem 5.2.i.
