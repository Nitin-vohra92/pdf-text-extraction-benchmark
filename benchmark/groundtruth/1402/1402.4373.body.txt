A comment on: "Further restrictions on the structure of finite DCI-groups"

Introduction

Let R be a finite group and let S be a subset of R. The Cayley digraph of R with connection set S, denoted [formula], is the digraph with vertex set R and with (x,y) being an arc if and only if xy- 1∈S. Now, [formula] is said to be a Cayley isomorphic digraph, or [formula]-graph for short, if whenever [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], there exists an automorphism φ of R with Sφ = T. Clearly, [formula] for every [formula] and hence, loosely speaking, for a [formula]-graph [formula] deciding when a Cayley digraph over R is isomorphic to [formula] is theoretically and algorithmically elementary; that is, the solving set for [formula] is reduced to simply [formula] (for the definition of solving set see for example [\cite=Muz] [\cite=Muz1]). The group R is a [formula]-group if [formula] is a [formula]-graph for every subset S of R. Moreover, R is a [formula]-group if [formula] is a [formula]-graph for every inverse-closed subset S of R. Thus every [formula]-group is a [formula]-group.

Throughout this paper, p will always denote a prime number.

In order to obtain new and severe constrains on the structure of a [formula]-group, the authors of [\cite=LiLP] considered the problem of determining which Frobenius groups R of order 6p are [formula]-groups. They were in fact interested in the more specific case of Frobenius groups of order 6p with Frobenius kernel of order p; this is clear from their analysis and their proofs, but is not specified in the statement of [\cite=LiLP]. The proof of their theorem as stated is therefore incomplete, as observed by Conder [\cite=marston]. The aim of this paper is to fix this discrepancy by completing the analysis of which Frobenius groups of order 6p are [formula]-groups, hence completing the proof of  [\cite=LiLP] as the authors stated it.

An elementary computation yields that if R is a Frobenius group of order 6p with Frobenius kernel whose order is not p, then R is isomorphic to the alternating group on four symbols [formula] (and p = 2), or to the quasidihedral group 〈(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(2,3)(5,6)〉 (and p = 3), or to the dihedral group of order 6p. A routine computer-assisted computation shows that [formula] is a [formula]-group and 〈(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(2,3)(5,6)〉 is not a [formula]-group. Moreover, as is observed in [\cite=marston], 〈(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(2,3)(5,6)〉 is a [formula]-group. Therefore in order to complete the analysis of Frobenius groups of order 6p, we only need to consider dihedral groups of order 6p.

Let p be a prime number and let R be the dihedral group of order 6p. Then R is a [formula]-group if and only if p  ≥  5, and R is a [formula]-group if and only if p  ≥  3.

The structure of the paper is straightforward. In Section [\ref=smallp], we consider the case p  ≤  5. In Section [\ref=basictools], we provide some preliminary definitions and our main tool. In Section [\ref=proof] we introduce some notation and we divide the proof of Theorem [\ref=thrm:main] into four cases, which we then study in turn in Sections [\ref=caseI]-[\ref=caseIV].

Small groups: p  ≤  5

Let p be a prime with p  ≤  5 and let R be the dihedral group of order 6p. Then R is a [formula]-group if and only if p = 5, and R is a [formula]-group if and only if p  ≠  2.

The proof follows from a computer computation with the invaluable help of the algebra system magma [\cite=magma]. Let Rp  =  〈a,b|a3p = b2 = (ab)2 = 1〉 be the dihedral group of order 6p. Here we simply prove that R2 is not a [formula]-group and that R3 is not a [formula]-group.

For p = 2, the graphs [formula] and [formula] are both isomorphic to the disjoint union of three cycles of length 4. As a3 is the only central involution of R2, there exists no automorphism of R2 mapping {b,a3} to {b,a3b}.

For p = 3, the digraphs [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic and a computation shows that there exists no automorphism of R3 mapping {a,a4,a6,a7} to {a2,a5,a6,a8}.

Given that the (di)graphs we described in this proof are not connected, it is worth observing that a group R is a [formula]-group if and only if every pair of connected isomorphic Cayley graphs on R are isomorphic via an automorphism of R. This is because the complement of a disconnected graph is always connected, and the property of being a [formula]-graph is preserved under taking complements. A similar observation also applies to [formula]-groups.

In view of Lemma [\ref=l:0] for the rest of this paper we may assume that p  ≥  7.

Some basic results

Babai [\cite=babai] has proved a very useful criterion for determining when a finite group R is a [formula]-group and, more generally, when [formula] is a [formula]-graph.

Let R be a finite group and let S be a subset of R. Then [formula] is a [formula]-graph if and only if [formula] contains a unique conjugacy class of regular subgroups isomorphic to R.

Let Ω be a finite set and let G be a permutation group on Ω. The 2-closure of G, denoted G(2), is the set

[formula]

where [formula] is the symmetric group on Ω. Observe that in the definition of G(2), the element gωω' of G may depend upon the ordered pair (ω,ω'). The group G is said to be 2-closed if G = G(2).

It is easy to verify that G(2) is a subgroup of [formula] containing G and, in fact, G(2) is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) subgroup of [formula] preserving every orbital digraph of G. It follows that the automorphism group of a graph is 2-closed. Therefore Lemma [\ref=lemma] immediately yields:

Let R be a finite group and let Rr be the right regular representation of R in [formula]. If, for every [formula], the groups Rr and Rπr are conjugate in 〈Rr,Rπr〉(2), then R is a [formula]-group.

Let S be a subset of R, and set [formula] and [formula]. Observe that Rr  ≤  A and that A is 2-closed. Let T be a regular subgroup of A isomorphic to R. Since 〈Rr,T〉  ≤  A, we get 〈Rr,T〉(2)  ≤  A(2) = A.

Every regular subgroup of [formula] isomorphic to R is conjugate to Rr and hence T = Rπr, for some [formula]. By hypothesis, Rr and T are conjugate in 〈Rr,T〉(2) and so are conjugate in A. In particular, A contains a unique conjugacy class of regular subgroups isomorphic to R and Lemma [\ref=lemma] gives that R is a [formula]-group.

We will use this formulation of Babai's criterion without comment in our proof of Theorem [\ref=thrm:main].

Notation and preliminary reductions

Multiplication of permutations is on the right, so στ is calculated by first applying σ, and then τ. For the rest of this paper we let R be the dihedral group of order 6p and we let [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=l:0], we may assume that p  ≥  7 in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thrm:main]. In what follows, we identify R with a regular subgroup of [formula] isomorphic to R, that is, R acts regularly on Ω. Let [formula] and set G: = 〈R,Rπ〉. In view of Lemma [\ref=babaistrong], Theorem [\ref=thrm:main] will follow by proving that R is conjugate to Rπ via an element of G(2).

Let Rp denote the Sylow p-subgroup of R, let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G with Rp  ≤  P and let T be a Sylow p-subgroup of [formula] with P  ≤  T. From Sylow's theorems, replacing Rπ by a suitable G-conjugate, we may assume that Rπp  ≤  P. Observe that, as p  ≥  7, the group T is elementary abelian of order p6. Since Rp and Rπp are acting semiregularly, their orbits on Ω must be equal to the orbits of T.

Since Rp is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of R, we see that R admits a unique system of imprimitivity C with blocks of size p, namely C consists of the Rp-orbits on Ω. Similarly, Rπ admits a unique system of imprimitivity with blocks of size p, namely Cπ, and the system of imprimitivity Cπ consists of the Rπp-orbits on Ω. Since each of these is equal to the orbits of T on Ω, we have C  =  Cπ, and C is R- and Rπ-invariant. As G = 〈R,Rπ〉, we get that C is also G-invariant. Therefore, G is conjugate to a subgroup of [formula]. Similarly, since C is π-invariant, π is conjugate to an element in [formula].

We can use this structure to decompose the set Ω as Δ  ×  Λ with |Δ| = p and |Λ| = 6. We identify Ω with Δ  ×  Λ, Δ with [formula] and Λ with [formula]. Write [formula] and [formula] the base group of W. Then for [formula], [formula], and (δ,λ)∈Δ  ×  Λ, we have

[formula]

and [formula]. Observe that under this identification the system of imprimitivity C is [formula] where Δλ  =  Δ  ×  {λ} for every λ∈Λ.

Let K be the kernel of the action of G on C, that is, [formula]. Clearly, RK / K and RπK / K are regular subgroups of [formula] isomorphic to [formula]. A direct inspection in [formula] shows that if A and B are regular subgroups of [formula] isomorphic to [formula], then either B is conjugate to A via an element of 〈A,B〉, or 〈A,B〉 = A  ×  B. Summing up and applying this observation to G / K, we obtain the following reduction.

Let c be the cycle [formula] of length p of [formula]. Set

[formula]

Replacing G by a suitable W-conjugate, we may assume that

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] and hence [formula], where α is a permutation fixing 1 and acting by conjugation on 〈c〉 as an automorphism of order p - 1.

As Rp  ≤  T, we see that T is generated by [formula] where

[formula]

Since Rπp  ≤  T and since Rπp is semiregular, we obtain

[formula]

with [formula] and for some [formula].

Now rπ1 = (cy1,cy2,cy3,cy4,cy5,cy6)∈Rπp and hence there exists [formula] with [formula], for every λ∈Λ. Thus [formula] and yλ = cuλαvλ for some [formula] and [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

Now r1∈R  ≤  G, and hence replacing π by r- u11π, we may assume that u1 = 0. Furthermore, [formula], and hence replacing π by [formula], we may assume that v1 = 0.

As [formula] has a normal Sylow p-subgroup, we get [formula] and K / P is isomorphic to a subgroup of 〈α〉  ×  〈α〉  ×  〈α〉  ×  〈α〉  ×  〈α〉  ×  〈α〉.

Next we define an equivalence relation [formula] on Ω. We say that [formula] if Pω = Pω'. Since [formula], we see that [formula] is G-invariant. Moreover, since P is abelian, we get that P acts regularly on each of its orbits and hence [formula] for every ω and ω' in the same P-orbit. This shows that [formula] defines a system of imprimitivity E for G coarser than C. In particular, [formula] consists of either 1, 2, 3 or 6 equivalence classes.

There is an equivalent definition of [formula]. Given ω∈Δλ and ω'∈Δλ', we have [formula] whenever, for every ρ∈P, ρ|Δλ  =  1 if and only if ρ|Δλ'  =  1 (or equivalently, ρ|Δλ is a p-cycle if and only if ρ|Δλ' is a p-cycle).

We will use the following lemma repeatedly.

For every ρ∈K and for every E∈E, the permutation ρE:Ω  →  Ω, fixing [formula] pointwise and acting on E as ρ does, lies in G(2).

This is Lemma 2 in [\cite=Dobson1995]. (We remark that [\cite=Dobson1995] is only stated for graphs, but the result holds for each orbital digraph of G, and hence for G(2).)

With all of this notation at our disposal we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=thrm:main] with a case analysis depending on the number of [formula]-equivalence classes.

Case I: [formula] has only one equivalence class

Here, Pω = Pω' for every ω,ω'∈Ω, hence P acts semiregularly on Ω and |P| = p. It follows that P = Rp = Rπp. In particular, [formula] and [formula]. Therefore π  =  σ(cu1,cu2,cu3,cu4,cu5,cu6) with u1 = 0.

Suppose that σ = 1. Since r2,rπ2∈G, we have

[formula]

and hence - u3 + u1 =  - u1 + u2 =  - u2 + u3 =  - u6 + u4 =  - u4 + u5 =  - u5 + u6. This gives u1 = u2 = u3 = 0 and u4 = u5 = u6. Write u: = u4. A similar computation gives

[formula]

Thus u =  - u and hence u = 0. Therefore π = 1 and Rπ = R. It follows that R is conjugate to Rπ via the identity element of G(2).

Suppose that σ = (5,6). Since r2,rπ2∈G, we have

[formula]

and by taking the [formula] power we get (c3( - u3 + u1),c3( - u1 + u2),c3( - u2 + u3),1,1,1)∈P. Thus 3( - u3 + u1) = 3( - u1 + u2) = 3( - u2 + u3) = 0 and since u1 = 0, we have u1 = u2 = u3 = 0. Moreover

[formula]

and by taking the [formula] power we get (1,1,1,c3( - u5 + u4),c3( - u6 + u5),c3( - u4 + u6))∈P. Thus 3( - u5 + u4) = 3( - u6 + u5) = 3( - u4 + u6) = 0 and hence u4 = u5 = u6. Write u: = u4. Now

[formula]

and by taking the [formula] power we get (c- 2u,c- 2u,c- 2u,c2u,c2u,c2u)∈P. Thus 2u =  - 2u, and hence u = 0. It follows that π  =  σ = (5,6) and

[formula]

We claim that π∈G(2), from which the proof of this case follows. First observe that (1,2,3)(4,5,6)(1,2,3)(4,6,5) = (1,3,2)∈G. Also r- 13rπ3 = (2,3)(5,6)∈G, and hence (conjugating by the elements of 〈(1,3,2)〉), we see that (1,2)(5,6) and (1,3)(5,6) belong to G. Next, let ω = (δ,λ) and ω' = (δ',λ') be in Ω. If λ,λ'∉{5,6}, then (ω,ω')π = (ω,ω')gωω' with gωω' = 1. If λ,λ'∈{5,6}, then (ω,ω')π = (ω,ω')gωω' with gωω' = (1,2)(5,6). Finally, suppose that only one of λ,λ' lies in {5,6}. Let λ'' be the element of [formula] and let gωω' be in {(1,2)(5,6),(1,3)(5,6),(2,3)(5,6)} fixing the block Δλ'' pointwise. Then (ω,ω')π = (ω,ω')gωω'.

Case II: [formula] has six equivalence classes

Since [formula] has six equivalence classes, for every two distinct λ,λ'∈Λ, there exists an element q∈P with q fixing Δλ pointwise and acting as the cycle c on Δλ'. From this it follows that P(2) = T. Next, from T  ≤  G(2), it follows that if γ:Ω  →  Ω is a permutation with the property that for each λ∈Λ, we have

Δγλ  =  Δλ and

γ|Δλ = gλ|Δλ for some gλ∈G fixing Δλ setwise,

then γ∈G(2).

As T = P(2)  ≤  G(2), replacing π by g- 1π for a suitable g∈T, we may assume that [formula].

For 2  ≤  λ  ≤  6, let gλ be the element of R that maps (1,1) to (1,λ) (so g2 = r2, etc.). Define γ:Ω  →  Ω by γ|Δ1  =  id|Δ1, and for 2  ≤  λ  ≤  6,

[formula]

By the observations we made in the first paragraph of this case, γ∈G(2). Careful computations show that (rπ1)γ = r1. Thus, (Rπp)γ = Rp. We now see that after conjugating Rπ by γ we are in Case I and can complete the proof as before.

Case III: [formula] has two equivalence classes

The [formula]-equivalence classes are blocks of imprimitivity for G of size 3p and are a union of P-orbits. The only system of imprimitivity for G / K with blocks of size 3 is {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}. Therefore the two [formula]-equivalence classes are [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=tedslemma] applied to ρ  =  r1, (c,c,c,1,1,1),(1,1,1,c,c,c)∈G(2).

Replacing π by g- 1π for a suitable g∈G(2), we may assume that u4 = 0. As Rπp  ≤  P, we get [formula] and [formula]. It follows that v1 = v2 = v3 = 0 and v4 = v5 = v6. Write β: = αv4. Therefore π  =  σ(1,cu2,cu3,β,cu5β,cu6β).

Suppose that σ = 1. We have

[formula]

and hence - u3 = u2 =  - u2 + u3 and - u6 = u5 =  - u5 + u6. This gives u2 = u3 = 0 and u5 = u6 = 0, that is, π = (1,1,1,β,β,β). A similar computation gives

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=tedslemma] with [formula] and ρ: = r- 13(r3)π, we get (1,1,1,β,β,β)∈G(2), that is, π∈G(2), from which the proof follows.

Suppose that σ = (5,6). Since r2,rπ2∈G, we have

[formula]

and by taking the [formula] power we get (c- 3u3,c3u2,c3( - u2 + u3),1,1,1)∈P. Thus - 3u3 = 3u2 = 3( - u2 + u3) and hence u1 = u2 = u3 = 0. Moreover

[formula]

and by taking the [formula] power we get (1,1,1,β- 1c- 3u5β,β- 1c3( - u6 + u5)β,β- 1c3u6β)∈P. Thus - 3u5 = 3( - u6 + u5) = 3u6 and hence u4 = u5 = u6 = 0. Thus π = (5,6)(1,1,1,β,β,β) and r- 12rπ2 = (4,6,5)∈G. This gives 〈(1,2,3),(4,5,6)〉  ≤  G.

Now

[formula]

Call this element ĝ1. As (1,2,3)∈G, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We claim that π∈G(2), from which the proof of this case immediately follows. Let ω = (δ,λ) and ω' = (δ',λ') be in Ω. If λ,λ'∈{1,2,3}, then (ω,ω')π = (ω,ω')gωω' with gωω' = 1. If λ,λ'∈{4,5,6}, then (ω,ω')π = (ω,ω')gωω' with gωω'  =  ĝ1. Finally, suppose that only one of λ,λ' lies in {1,2,3}. Without loss of generality we may assume that λ∈{1,2,3} and λ'∈{4,5,6}. Thus ωπ = (δ,λ)π = (δ,λ) and ω'π = (δ',λ')π = (δ'β,λ'(5,6)). Since 〈c〉 is transitive on Δ, there exists x∈〈c〉 with δx  =  δβ- 1. Set gωω': = ĝλ(x,x,x,1,1,1)- 1 and observe that gωω'∈G. By construction, we have (ω,ω')π = (ω,ω')gωω'.

Case IV: [formula] has three equivalence class

Observe that the [formula]-equivalence classes are blocks of imprimitivity for G of size 2p and are union of P-orbits. In case [\eqref=red1eq2] of Reduction [\ref=reduction1], the group G / K has no system of imprimitivity with blocks of size 2 and hence this case cannot arise. Therefore only case ([\ref=red1eq1]) can happen, that is, σ = 1.

The group [formula] has three subgroups of order 2 and hence G / K has three systems of imprimitivity with blocks of size 2, namely {{1,4},{2,6},{3,5}}, {{1,5},{2,4},{3,6}} and {{1,6},{2,5},{3,4}}. Without loss of generality we may assume that the three [formula]-equivalence classes are [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Applying Lemma [\ref=tedslemma] with ρ: = r1 and with [formula], we get

[formula]

Replacing π by g- 1π for a suitable g∈P̂, we may assume that u2 = u3 = 0. Furthermore, as Rπp  ≤  P, we get [formula], [formula] and [formula]. It follows that v1 = v4 = 0 and v2 = v6 and v3 = v5. Write β: = αv2 and γ: = αv3. Therefore π = (1,β,γ,cu4,cu5γ,cu6β).

We have

[formula]

and hence - u4 = u4, - u5 = u5 and - u6 = u6. Thus u4 = u5 = u6 = 0 and π = (1,β,γ,1,γ,β). Similarly, we have

[formula]

Call this element g. As [formula] is a [formula]-equivalence class, γ- 1  =  β- 1 and hence π  =  (1,β,β,1,β,β) and g  =  (β- 1,β,1,β- 1,β,1). Applying Lemma [\ref=tedslemma] with ρ: = g and [formula], we get g': = (1,β,1,1,β,1)∈G(2). Thus g'': = (g')r2 = (1,1,β,1,1,β)∈G(2) and π = g'g''∈G(2), from which the proof follows.
