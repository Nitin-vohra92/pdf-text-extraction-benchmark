Carbon-rich planet formation in a solar composition disk

Introduction

The C/O ratio is a key parameter for the chemical composition and evolution of giant planets atmospheres since it controls the relative abundances of C- and O-bearing species. Studies suggest that at equilibrium, as the C/O ratio increases (≥  0.8) in the gas phase, all the available O goes into organics, CO, CO2 and CH3OH, so that the gas phase becomes H2O-free and the remaining C is in the form of CH4 [\citep=2010ApJ...709.1396F] [\citep=2011ApJ...743..191M]. The CO/CH4/CO2 ratios in planetary atmospheres are also affected by the possible existence of non equilibrium chemistry effects due to dynamical mixing and photochemistry [\citep=2012A&A...546A..43V]. The C/O ratio is also crucial for understanding the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks [\citep=1999JGR...10419003C] [\citep=1993prpl.conf.1005P].

Based on comparisons between a grid of model predictions and six narrowband photometry points for the dayside atmosphere of the Hot Jupiter (HJ) WASP 12b, [\cite=2011Natur.469...64M] found a best fitting model of C/O≥  1 and C/H = 2×  10- 5-1×  10- 3, to compare with the stellar host values of C/O ~   0.56 and C/H ~   6×  10- 4. These authors concluded that WASP 12b probably has a superstellar C/O but with a substellar C/H ratio. Because giant planets are expected to have stellar or superstellar metallicities [\citep=2005astro.ph..4214K], new formation models consistent with the properties of WASP 12b have been proposed. For instance, [\cite=2011ApJ...743L..16O] considered the H2O, CO and CO2 snowlines in a protoplanetary disk model, and found an increase of the gaseous C/O ratio (compared to the C/O ratio of the stellar host) in the disk regions boxed by these snowlines, even reaching ~  1 between the CO and CO2 snowlines. They proposed that WASP 12b might have accreted its gaseous envelope in this area but they neglected the dynamical and thermodynamic processes like gas drag, diffusion and sublimation that may affect the abundances of volatiles in protoplanetary disks. On the other hand, [\cite=2011ApJ...743..191M] have shown that WASP 12b's atmospheric C/O is inconsistent with an atmosphere of the host star's composition, even if enriched in heavy elements by icy planetesimals dissolved in the planet's envelope, and suggest that it may have been formed in an O-depleted part of the protoplanetary disk. Here, we present a fully dynamical and multi-snowline model describing the transport and distribution of C and O bearing volatiles in protoplanetary disks, which is inspired from the original idea of [\cite=1998Icar..135..537C]. The model is used to compute the C/O ratio as a function of the radial distance in order to constrain the possible formation locations of carbon-rich HJs. In Sec. 2 we present the different components of our model. Our results are presented in Section 3. In section 4 we discuss the implications and predictions of our model for the formation of carbon-rich HJs, and in particular for WASP 12b.

Model prescription

Here we describe the processes that affect the distribution of volatiles abundances in protoplanetary disks. In our approach, we assume that H2O and CO are the main C-and O-bearing species. We track their respective evolutions near their snowlines, due to multiple effects described below.

The protoplanetary disk

The backbone of our model is the protoplanetary disk model of [\cite=2005A&A...442..703H] [\cite=2006MNRAS.367L..47G]. This is a standard one-dimensional α-viscosity disk model, where the viscosity is assumed to be generated by turbulence characterized by the free parameter α according to the formalism of [\cite=1973A&A....24..337S]:

[formula]

This model follows [\cite=1990AJ.....99..924B] in the (gas+dust) opacity expression and [\cite=1991ApJ...375..740R] in the expressions of the isothermal sound speed Cs , and the mid-plane density ρc. The authors also take into account the disk's self-gravity in calculating the scale height H. The temperature is calculated by assuming a geometrically thin disk heated by both star illumination and the dissipation of viscous energy. The disk is supposed to be optically thick in the radial direction, but the heat can be transported efficiently vertically.

Finally, we chose to use the mean gas radial velocity obtained by [\cite=2010ApJ...719.1633H] from their 1+1D α-disk model. In 1+1D and 2D models, in contrast with 1D models, the mean advective gas flow experienced by solid particles in the midplane is outward, but the vertically integrated movement is inward as a result of accretion. In all simulations, we used the disk properties obtained from [\cite=2005A&A...442..703H] using their inward gas velocity, but imposed the outward velocity from [\cite=2010ApJ...719.1633H] in the solid tracking modules only.

The evolution of solids

Three important processes affecting solids are incorporated into our model: advection due to solid-gas interaction, sublimation and coagulation. The solids behavior in protoplanetary disks depend strongly on their size [\citep=1977MNRAS.180...57W].

where [formula] and [formula] are the gas mean pressure and density, Ωk is the Keplerian frequency, [formula] is the mean relative transverse velocity between particles and gas, [formula] the mean relative radial velocity, [formula] the mean gas radial velocity , ts * the stopping time of the particle, Sc the Schmidt number, D the diffusion coefficient, r the heliocentric distance and [formula] the global solid particles density. For numerical simplicity we follow [\cite=1996A&A...309..301S] in choosing D = 3ν, a value consistent with more detailed numerical values of D [\citep=1988A&A...193..313C], and which cancels the third term in the second equation. The presence of a strong vertical magnetic field though might affect the value of D [\citep=2006MNRAS.370L..71J]. These equations are coupled to the disk model, and are solved using a globally convergent Newton method [\citep=1992nrfa.book.....P]. This module replicated successfully the results of [\cite=1996A&A...309..301S] within a small factor probably due to the different disk models used.

The sublimation modeling is based on the simplified approach of [\cite=2000Icar..146..525S]. We ignore the condensation of gas on the particle since it is assumed to be minimal in the inner hot regions. We finally write the theoretical maximum sublimation rate of a particle (g cm- 2 s- 1) as

and derive the particle's radius decrease rate (cm s- 1) in the form

where vs is the volume of single molecules, k the Boltzmann constant, m is the particle's mass and T is its surface temperature. We multiply the sublimation rate by 0.63 following the experimental results of [\cite=1992JPhCh..96.8502H].

We model the dust coagulation into larger particles following [\cite=2006Icar..181..178C] (Eq. 26):

where Σd is the dust surface density, Ω(r) is the Keplerian angular rotation velocity at distance r and trcoag is the average timescale for larger bodies (in this case decimetric pebbles) to grow from the local dust supply at distance r. We choose t1AUcoag = 103 years, which is the lowest value considered by [\cite=2006Icar..181..178C] and others since we do not grow our particles all the way to meter scale in this work. The solids in fact are not allowed to grow larger than 10 cm, since most of the solid mass density in disks is supposed to be in pebbles of this size scale [\citep=2012A&A...544A..32L]. We also choose Σd = 1 g/cm- 2, an average value obtained at t = 105 years in seven runs made by [\cite=2006Icar..181..178C], as the average dust surface density at both snowlines since we were not able to find any detailed modelling of this quantity in cases relevant to our model. It is assumed to be constant with respect to time; modeling the expected individual evolutionary trajectories of the surface densities of dust and pebbles is a substantial numerical undertaking beyond the scope of this work.

The evolution of vapors

Two processes affecting volatile vapors are included: vapor diffusion and condensation into solid dust. Any existing volatile vapor is coupled to the H2 gas, advecting along with it but diffuses according to its own gradient. The diffusion is modeled following the approach depicted in [\cite=1988Icar...75..146S], [\cite=1998Icar..135..537C] and others:

[formula]

where c is the vapor concentration (c = 1 for stellar abundance) and S(r,t) is the source function due to replenishment. This equation is solved and evolved using the explicit Forward time - Centered space (FTCS) method [\citep=1992nrfa.book.....P]. Once the vapor attains a low enough temperature (160 K for H2O, 25 K for CO), it condenses into solid ice. We assume that the vapor, following the cold finger effect, condenses instantaneously and completely either on existing submillimetric dust or directly as pure ice, leading in both cases to the formation of typical 10- 2 cm sized dust particles. This sets a boundary condition for eq. (9) of c = 0 for the vapor concentration. The particles are then advected outward along with the gas while coagulating into the pebbles that will later replenish the vapor. This concentration of dust at the snowline position might induce an additional diffusive motion. This could result in an extra source term just interior to the snowline. This effect is neglected in the following and will be discussed in section 4.

The diffusion of the vapors described by the evolution of both in addition to gas. Any in the behavior of the different gases in the nebula is due to the boundary conditions used to solve this equation. Physically this . The presence of a snowline will induce a concentration gradient resulting in an outwardly-directed vapor flux. In the absence of replenishment, the region inside the snowline will become depleted on a timescale tdiff  =  r2  /  D where is the diffusion distance . different diffusion timescales for H2O and CO . In the case of the nebular H2 gas for which no snowline is present, r in the above equation is the centrifugal radius Rc. Using , we

For a more realistic , one has to add replenishment to the discussed above, as by [\cite=1988Icar...75..146S]. The replenishment is mainly caused by the inward drift and sublimation of the particles created from the condensation of gas into dust at the snowline, and the dust's subsequent coagulation into larger particles. A simple model including this effect was elaborated by [\cite=1998Icar..135..537C]. In our model, these replenishing particles are assumed to be entirely in the form of decimetric pebbles. In the presence of a permanent sink term like a static kilometric planetesimal [\citep=2004ApJ...614..490C] [\citep=2006Icar..181..178C], the vapor is always depleted no matter what may be the replenishment speed. In the absence of a permanent sink, the replenishment rate is crucial to the results. Fast replenishment will cause an enrichment of the vapor abundance inside the snowline, while slow replenishment will still result in vapor depletion. In our model the replenishment rate is defined as S(r,t)  =  crep / trep where crep is the total concentration of the replenishing material present at the snowline position as a function of time, and trep is the longest time duration between the coagulation and sublimation timescales, is the factor that controls the replenishment speed. We neglect the time an inward pebble needs after its formation is complete in order to reach the snowline since it is too short compared to the other considered timescales. Vapor depletion will only result if trep is sufficiently long. The main goal of our model is to calculate accurate replenishment rates to track the concentrations of volatiles inside and at their snowlines.

Results

A typical simulation starts with a decimetric pebble (H2O or CO) near its corresponding snowline. This particle is large enough to be decoupled from gas. It will drift inward at the velocity determined by the transport module, and starts sublimating. The time needed for sublimation and the distance traveled before it happens are calculated by the sublimation module. These values are communicated to the vapor diffusion module through the source function. The diffusion module then evolves the vapor concentration inside the snowline. The removed vapor will condense instantaneously at the snowline into 0.1 mm sized dust. This dust, coupled to the gas, will start diffusing outward while coagulating into 10-cm sized pebbles, where it will get decoupled and start drifting inward repeating the cycle.

For the rest of this work, we will use the disk properties at 105 years. {The disk is supposed stationary since modeling the temporal migration of snowlines require detailed modeling of the accumulated ices present beyond them, which is beyond the scope of this work. The implication of this assumption on the results should be minimal since the planetary formation timescale is thought to be shorter than the disk evolution timescale [\citep=2009Icar..199..338L].

The initial conditions of the disk model are: α = 0.01 (same value used by [\cite=2010ApJ...719.1633H]), Mcloud = 1 [formula], Ωcloud = 3.0×   10- 14 s- 1, Tcloud = 10 K, M0,star = 0.1 [formula] and Tstar = 4000 K. At 105 years, this leads to a star disk system with respective masses of 0.7 and 0.015 [formula], although . The disk properties obtained are typical for protoplanetary disks [\citep=2005A&A...442..703H] and give gas surface densities compatible with results reported by [\cite=2010ApJ...719.1633H]. The disk surface density, temperature, turbulent velocity and density profiles we use are given in Fig. [\ref=fig:disk]. Water vapor condenses into crystalline ice at ~   160 K, and the CO condensation temperature is ~   25 K [\citep=2002crc..book.....L]. This places the H2O and CO snowlines in our disk model at 3.8 AU and 28 AU, respectively. The location of the CO snowline in our model is comparable to that recently inferred at ~   30 AU in TW Hya [\citep=2013Sci...341..630Q]. We assume an initial homogeneous disk C/O ratio of solar value ~   0.55 [\citep=2009ARA&A..47..481A].

Table 1 shows the results from the transport, sublimation and coagulation modules. For H2O solids near the snowline, mm-sized particles and smaller move outward while particles equal to and larger than 1 cm move inward. The decoupling size for H2O particles (where they change direction) is between those two values. 10 cm sized pebbles will drift inward during ~  1.0×  104 years before sublimation, crossing a distance of ~   2.8 AU. This contradicts the results of [\cite=2006Icar..181..178C] who reported inward traveling distances for particles of no more than a few tenths AU. This difference might be attributed to the different velocity profiles, disk models and parameters used ([\cite=2006Icar..181..178C] used larger α values. Due to the use of an exponential law for depicting its rate, the sublimation occurs almost at the very end of the particle's inward travel. The vapor concentration is thus enhanced in a narrow region both for H2O and CO. On the other hand, 10- 2 cm sized dust will diffuse outward and coagulate with other particles for 2.2×  104 years before reaching pebble-size. Although this seems to corresponds to a traveled distance of ~   1.6 AU, the real traveled distance should be shorter, since the particle will stop diffusing outward once it reached the decoupling size.

In the case of CO, the decoupling size of particles is between 10- 2 and 10- 1 cm. Decimetric pebbles will move inward during 3.5×  103 years before sublimating, corresponding to a travel distance of 19.7 AU from their starting position. Coupled 10- 2 cm CO particles also need 2.2×  104 years in order to coagulate into pebbles, namely the same timescale as for H2O particles, since our approach is species independent and that dust surface densities are assumed equal near both icelines.

In the case of H2O, . In the case of CO, the pebbles for sublimation is much shorter than the dust coagulation timescale. For these reasons, in both cases the replenishment rate is limited by the dust coagulation time (~  2.2  ×  104 years), being more sensitive to this parameter than H2O due to its sublimation timescale.

The evolution of the vapor concentrations is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:main]. In both cases, the vapor diffusion is much faster than replenishment. The replenishment rate is not enough to counter the effect of diffusion, due to the long coagulation timescales limiting this rate. These long timescales act as a temporary that significantly slows down the replenishment. This leads to a gradual depletion in vapor concentration inside the iceline, analogous to the depletion reported by [\cite=1998Icar..135..537C], although faster and with lower vapor concentrations due to the different models used. This depletion is compensated by an increase in solids surface density near the iceline itself. The comparison of the two panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:main] shows that the vapor depletion is much faster for H2O than for CO. This is caused by the CO iceline that is much farther out than H2O's iceline, giving CO vapor a longer distance to travel before condensation. {The H2O vapor concentration profile reaches a quasi-depleted stationary state in [formula] years. This is faster than the "no radial drift" case in [\cite=1998Icar..135..537C], which is mainly due to our closer snowline and higher D. This relatively short diffusive timescale for H2O our assumption of a stationary nebula, since the [\citep=2005A&A...442..703H]. Finally, our model was able to reproduce some of the results of [\cite=2004ApJ...614..490C] using the correct parameters, and considering meter-sized bodies instead of pebbles.

Implications for carbon-rich planet formation

The difference in the timescales needed to deplete water and CO vapors from the region inside the H2O snowline leads to a gas phase composition compatible with the observed abundances in WASP 12b's dayside atmosphere. During a long period of time, the CO vapor is the major C and O bearing species in that region, increasing the gas C/O ratio of the area up to ~  1 (Fig. [\ref=fig:ctoo]). The C/O in this case is never exactly equal to or higher than Even if the CO vapor in much higher concentrations than H2O in this region, it is still depleted with respect to the initial stellar abundance, leading to a substellar C/H value. For example, Fig. [\ref=fig:main] shows that at t = 5.0[formula] years and for r = 2 AU, cH2O  ~   0.01, but cCO  ~   0.55, giving C/O ~   0.98 and C/H ~   0.55 times the solar value. Any giant planet accreting its envelope from this region in the disk have an atmospheric superstellar C/O ~   1 and a substellar C/H, corresponding to the properties of the so-called "carbon rich planets".

A plausible scenario is that WASP 12b's core was formed through a streaming instability [\citep=2005ApJ...620..459Y] at or beyond the location of the water snowline where the solids surface density is high (since water vapor is depleted and concentrated as solids at its snowline location in 104 yr), then accreted its atmosphere in the inner region where the C/O ratio is superstellar . This scenario assumes that the core does not mix with the accreted atmosphere. The opposite case of a well mixed envelope would explain a planet with a higher oxygen but lower carbon abundance than its host star. Absent detailed information on the formation location of the planet's core and its subsequent evolution, we can also assume that the entire planet formed in the region inside the water snowline. Our nominal (first) scenario differs from the one postulated by [\cite=2011ApJ...743L..16O]. It has the advantage of ending the formation of WASP 12b in the inner region of the disk, which is much closer to its observed location than in [\cite=2011ApJ...743L..16O]. to invoke long distance migration to explain the observed abundances. It also contradicts their conclusion that superstellar C/O with substellar C/H are compatible only with a planet accreting its atmosphere beyond the water snowline. Further, The same can be said for the CO ice grains inside the corresponding CO snowline.

Since the first report of the C/O ratio in WASP 12b dayside atmosphere, it has been the subject of many followup studies and observations. Some of those confirmed the initial inferred abundances [\citep=2013MNRAS.435.2268F], and others disagreed [\citep=2013Icar..225..432S]. In the generic volatiles transport model we presented, we made no assumptions regarding WASP 12b. The results are independent from its atmospheric observations. We used a typical protoplanetary disk code and added generic well studied physical effects. Therefore even if future studies definitely ruled out the superstellar C/O ratio in WASP 12b, our results will still be valid and informative since it would help constraint the possible formation location and migration history of planets. Our model is also independent from the absolute positions of the icelines. What is relevant is the relative positions between the two.

Another important parameter in our model is the coagulation timescale. It controls the CO replenishment rate since it is higher than the sublimation timescale, which is not the case for H2O. For an improbable ticelinecoag ≤   3.5×  103 years, the CO replenishment will become faster than diffusion, allowing for simultaneously superstellar C/H and C/O ratios inside the water's iceline since H2O would still be depleted but CO might be enhanced above solar value if there is enough replenishing matter beyond the snowline. This would result in solids depletion at the snowline and thus excluding this location as a planets forming region. The growth timescale can also be affected if we take into account the continuous condensation of vapor on dust in addition to the considered coagulation. [\cite=2013A&A...552A.137R] found that for α  ~   0.01, the condensation of mm sized dust into 10-cm sized pebbles is possible in 103 Ω- 1k, corresponding in our model to 103 and 104 years respectively near the water and CO snowlines. These timescales would lead to similar results as inferred from our model. It is worth mentioning also that in our model we made the implicit assumption that CO is not trapped in water ice clathrates. This should not affect our main results though since the clathration temperature (~   45 K [\citep=1985ApJS...58..493L]) would act as a CO snowline, although a more complete model that includes clathrates transport can give important informations in this regard. In all cases, the water vapor will be depleted much quicker than CO, and the inferred C/O ratio will hold. The C/H ratio on the other hand might be affected by such processes. Finally the observation of a CO snowline by [\cite=2013Sci...341..630Q] hints in favor of CO behaving similar to water.

An important approximation made in our model is to neglect the effect of ices drifting in from beyond the snowlines on the replenishement rates. We do account for the inward drift of pebbles, with some delay due to coagulation time and and time to return to the snowline. Further more, the sublimation of pebbles is a rather slow process as shown in Table 1 and act as a source a few AUs inside the snowline. What we are not considering is the return of microscopic dust grains inside the snowline.

Since we assume the condensation or adsorption of vapor is an instantaneous phenomenon at this scale, then sublimation of any returning grain would also be instantaneous. As shown in Section 2, the main gas motion in the midplane is a strong outward advection which carries the miscroscopic grains. The condensation of vapor at the snowline creates a dust concentration gradient peaking at this position. This gradient will cause an isotropic diffusion of the dust, inducing an inward movement for some fraction of the microscopic grains. These grains will immediately sublimate as soon as they reach interior of the snowline, effectively counteracting the vapor gradient imposed by the cold finger effect. This effect slows down the depletion of the vapors. In our calculations we supposed the dominance of outward advection which will substantially mute the inward diffusion due to the much lower advection timescale and the non-null condensation time in realistic situations.

Even considering only the diffusive motion, pebbles will eventually grow from the grains [\citep=2013A&A...552A.137R] and finally allow the formation of a planetary core at the water snowline. This core will act as a permanent sink rapidly accreting the newly condensed dust [\citep=2004ApJ...614..490C] [\citep=2006Icar..181..178C], allowing water to be depleted in 104 yr and our scenario to hold. This core will then migrate inward and accrete its envelope from the C/O enhanced gas.

With current technology, only alkali metals, H2O, CO, CO2 and CH4 are observable in exoplanets atmospheres [\citep=2013Icar..226.1654T]. In the near future, with the arrival of JWST, E-ELT and other new astronomical facilities, additional species should be detectable, so it might be useful to use our model to predict the abundances of other elements. N should be among the most abundant observable metals in giant planets atmospheres after O and C. In protoplanetary disks, N2 (a volatile) is assumed to be the major N bearing species [\citep=1993prpl.conf.1005P]. If we assume that WASP 12b accreted its atmosphere inside the water snowline, N should be accreted in gaseous form leading to a stellar or slightly substellar (due to vapor depletion) NH3 abundance in the deep atmosphere at equilibrium. Since all volatiles are accreted in gaseous form in the envelope, we exclude a possible N enrichment induced by its trapping in clathrate hydrates in the nebula.
