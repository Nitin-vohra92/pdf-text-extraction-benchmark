Sharp Estimates for Norms of Functions from Conjugate Classes in Metrics C and L

Let WrHω  (r = 0,1,...;  W0Hω = Hω) be the class of 2π-periodic, r times differentiable functions f(x) such that the modulus of continuity of its r-th derivative ω(f(r),t)  (f(0) = f) is less or equal to the given modulus of continuity ω(t). In addition, let Wr0Hω be the set of functions f∈WrHω satisfying

[formula]

For a function f(x), denote by [formula] the function that is trigonometrically conjugate (see [\cite=Bary]) with f(x). Let

[formula]

In papers [\cite=Korn1], [\cite=korn2] for any r = 0,1,... and concave modulus of continuity ω(t) exact values

[formula]

and

[formula]

were obtained. Estimates for the values

[formula]

as well as estimates for differences of higher order were found in [\cite=Motorn].

We have proved the following statements.

If ω(t) is concave modulus of continuity and for some ε  >  0

[formula]

then

[formula]

[formula]

where ρ(x) is defined by the equation

[formula]

Note that proof of this Theorem essentially uses the representation (see [\cite=Bary])

[formula]

and Lemma 5.1 from [\cite=Korn].

Remark 1. There exist concave moduli of continuity, e. g. ω(t) =  - 1 /  ln t, for which the values [formula] and [formula] are equal to ∞   .

Remark 2. If En(f) is the best uniform approximation of 2π - periodic function f by trigonometric polynomials of order n, then

For any concave modulus of continuity the following equalities hold

where

[formula]

Proof of this Theorem uses analogs of Lemmas 1 and 2 from [\cite=korn2].

For any r = 2,3,... the following equalities hold

[formula]

where WrK is the class of 2π - periodic functions f(x) such that f(r - 1) is absolutely continuous and almost everywhere |f(r)(x)|  ≤  K.

For any r = 2,3,... and any concave modulus of continuity ω(t) the following equalities hold

[formula]

Remark 3. For every presented above extremal relation there exists a function from corresponding class that realizes supremum.
