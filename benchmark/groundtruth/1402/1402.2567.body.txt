Schatten class Toeplitz operators on generalized Fock spaces

Introduction

Let [formula] and let d be the usual exterior derivative. Throughout the paper, let [formula] be a real valued function on [formula] such that

[formula]

holds uniformly pointwise on [formula] for some positive constants c and C (in the sense of positive (1,1) forms) where ω0  =  ddc|  ·  |2 is the standard Euclidean Kähler form.

Define F2φ to be the set of entire functions such that

[formula]

Denote by P the orthogonal projection of L2(e- 2φdv) onto F2φ. For a positive measure μ, define the Toeplitz operator Tμ:F2φ  →  F2φ with symbol μ by setting

[formula]

where K stands for the reproducing (or Bergman) kernel of F2φ, that is,

[formula]

where {fk} is any orthonormal basis for F2φ. In the next section we list some recent results on the reproducing kernel (see [\cite=SV]), which will be crucial to the proofs of our main results on Schatten class properties of Toeplitz operators.

In [\cite=IZ] (see also a recent monograph of Zhu [\cite=Z]), Toeplitz operators were considered in the setting of the standard weighted Fock spaces, that is, when [formula] for α  >  0, and characterizations of bounded, compact and Schatten class Toeplitz operators with positive measure symbols were provided (moreover, see [\cite=SV] for a similar characterization of bounded and compact Toeplitz operators with positive measure symbols on [formula]). In particular, the Schatten class membership of these Toeplitz operators was characterized in terms of the heat (Berezin) transform of the symbol and in terms of the averaging function μ(B(  ·  ,r)).

In this paper we will provide very similar characterizations of the Schatten class membership of these Toeplitz operators. Note that unlike the classical Fock space setting where one can utilize explicit formulas for the reproducing kernel, we instead must rely on some known estimates on the behavior of the reproducing kernel (see the first three lemmas in the next section). The proofs of our characterizations will (as usual) be divided into the two cases 0 < p  ≤  1 (which will be dealt with in Section [\ref=case1]) and p > 1 (which will be dealt with in Section [\ref=case2].)

Let us note that one can easily write the so called "Fock-Sobolev spaces" from [\cite=CZ] as a weighted Fock space [formula] with φ satisfying ([\ref=PhiCond]), so that in particular our results immediately apply to these spaces (see [\cite=I] for more details.)

Finally, note that we will often use the notation [formula] for two nonnegative quantities A and B if A  ≤  CB for an unimportant constant C. Moreover, the notation [formula] and A  ≈  B will have similar meanings.

The case 0  <  p  ≤  1

In this section we will characterize Schatten p class Tμ for the case 0  <  p  ≤  1. We will often use the following three lemmas from [\cite=SV].

If K is the reproducing kernel of [formula] then there exists ε0  >  0 where

There exists δ  >  0 where for all w∈B(z,δ). In particular, K(z,z)e- 2φ(z)  ≈  1.

If r  >  0 then there exists Cr  >  0 independent of [formula] where

The basic outline of our arguments will be similar to the proofs in [\cite=Z] for the classical Fock space (which themselves are based on the ideas in the seminal paper [\cite=L]). However, note that in the classical Fock space situation (when [formula] for some α  >  0), we have that Because of this, we will often have to make modifications to the arguments in [\cite=Z].

Now assume μ satisfies the condition that

[formula]

for all γ  >  0 and [formula]. Note that Lemma [\ref=OffDiagDecayLem] immediately tells us that Tμ is well defined on the span of [formula] if μ satisfies condition ([\ref=propertyM]), so in particular Tμ is densely defined.

Let [formula] be the Berezin transform of μ defined by [formula] where kz is the normalized reproducing kernel of [formula]. Note that (as one would expect), ([\ref=propertyM]) in conjunction with Fubini's theorem gives us that

If r  >  0 then for the remainder of this paper we will let {am} denote any fixed arrangement of the lattice [formula] (which is canonically treated as a subset of [formula].)

Suppose that μ  ≥  0,r  >  0, and 0  <  p  ≤  1. If μ satisfies condition (), then the following are equivalent:

[formula]

[formula]

{μ(B(am,r))}∈lp

The equivalence of (b) and (c) for any r  >  0 was proved in [\cite=Z], where it was also proved that (b) and (c) are in fact independent of r  >  0. Thus, we will complete the proof by showing that [formula] for some r  >  0.

First assume that (c) is true. Then by Lemma [\ref=PointwiseBound] we have that

[formula]

where the last inequality and ε0  >  0 follow from Lemma [\ref=OffDiagDecayLem]. However, B(u,r)  ⊂  B(am,2r) if u∈B(am,r) so that

[formula]

Furthermore, since 0  <  p  ≤  1, equation () gives us that

[formula]

However, we can easily estimate the right hand side of () as follows. First, it is obvious that

[formula]

On the other hand, if |z  -  am|  ≥  2r and |u  -  am|  ≤  r, then so that Thus, we have that

[formula]

Finally, combining () with () and () we have that for some Cr  >  0 since (c) is independent of r  >  0.

We now complete the proof by showing that (a)  ⇒  (c) for [formula] where δ is from Lemma [\ref=OffDiagDecayLem]. In particular, Moreover, if z∈B(am,δ / 2) then Lemma [\ref=LowerBoundForKernel] gives us that which immediately implies that (c) is true with [formula]

Suppose that μ  ≥  0 and μ satisfies condition (). Then

Tμ∈Sp if [formula] and 0  <  p  ≤  1,

[formula] if Tμ∈Sp and 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  .

Since [formula] implies that {μ(B(am,r))} is bounded by Lemma [\ref=EquivOfBerTypeFunc], we first of all have that Tμ is bounded on [formula] by Theorem 1 in [\cite=SV]. Furthermore, since [formula], one can repeat virtually word for word the arguments on pp. 96-97 in [\cite=Z] to complete the proof.

We will need one more lemma before we prove the main result of this section. Note that the proof of this lemma follows from standard ideas in frame theory (see the proof of Lemma 3.7 in [\cite=LR] for example), though we will include its simple proof for the sake of completion.

Let r  >  0 and let {em} be any orthonormal basis for [formula]. If [formula] and A is the operator on [formula] defined by Aem: = kξm then A extends to a bounded operator on all of [formula] whose operator norm is bounded above by a constant that only depends on r.

If [formula], then the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Lemma [\ref=PointwiseBound], and the reproducing property gives us that

[formula]

Note that [formula] is not a norm when p  <  1. However, it is well known that if A and B are compact, then where sk(T) is the [formula] singular value of a compact operator T. Thus, it is easy to see that for all 0  <  p  ≤  1 we have

[formula]

for any A,B∈Sp.

Suppose μ  ≥  0,0  <  p  ≤  1, and μ satisfies condition (). Then the following are equivalent:

Tμ∈Sp

[formula]

[formula]

{μ(B(am,r))}∈lp

By Lemmas [\ref=EquivOfBerTypeFunc] and [\ref=BerInLpImpSchat], it is enough to show that (a)  ⇒  (d) for r  =  δ where again δ is from Lemma [\ref=LowerBoundForKernel]. For that matter, pick some large R  >  2δ (to be determined later) and partition {am} into N sublattices {ξm} where m  ≠  k  ⇒  |ξm  -  ξk|  >  R. Furthermore, let Clearly Tν  ≤  Tμ so that [formula].

Now fix any orthonormal basis {em} of [formula] and let A be the operator on [formula] defined by Aem: = kξm (which by Lemma [\ref=FrameOpBdd] has operator norm that is bounded above by a constant that is independent of {ξm}). Now let T: = A*TνA so that Furthermore, define and E: = T  -  D so that by () we have Then since D is diagonal, we have from Lemma [\ref=LowerBoundForKernel] that

[formula]

for some C1  >  0 independent of N.

We will now get an upper bound for [formula]. By Proposition 1.29 in [\cite=Z2] and Lemma [\ref=OffDiagDecayLem], we have that

[formula]

Now if m  ≠  k then |ξm  -  ξk|  ≥  R. Thus, if [formula], then the triangle inequality gives us that [formula]. Plugging this into ([\ref=MainThmForpleq1OffDiagEst1]) gives us that

[formula]

Since ν is supported on [formula], we have that

[formula]

Moreover, if j  ≠  m and |u  -  ξj|  <  δ then Thus, as |ξj  -  ξm|  >  R  ≥  2δ we have that and clearly we have a similar estimate for |u  -  ξk|.

Plugging this into () gives us that

[formula]

Thus, since 0  <  p  ≤  1, we can plug () into () to get that

[formula]

which means that there exists C2  >  0 independent of N where

[formula]

Combining () and () we have that so setting R large enough gives us that

[formula]

for all μ where {μ(B(ξj,δ))}∈lp. However, an easy approximation argument gives us that () holds for all positive Borel measures μ with Tμ∈Sp.

Finally, since () holds for each of the N sublattices of {am} and since N obviously only depends on R, we get that which completes the proof.

The case p  ≥  1

In this section we will consider the simpler case of p  ≥  1. As with the case 0  <  p  ≤  1, the approach is quite similar to the standard Fock space situation. We will need one preliminary result before we prove our main result.

If p  ≥  1 and [formula], then Tf∈Sp.

Clearly without loss of generality we can assume that f  ≥  0. If μ  =  f  dv then clearly we have that [formula] if [formula] so that Tf is bounded on [formula]. The proof now follows immediately by Lemma [\ref=LowerBoundForKernel] in conjunction with the arguments on p. 245 in [\cite=Z] that are used to prove this result in the classical Fock space setting.

Suppose [formula], p  ≥  1, and μ satisfies condition [\eqref=propertyM]. Then the following are equivalent:

Tμ is in the Schatten class Sp;

[formula];

[formula];

{μ(B(am,r))}∈lp.

That (c) and (d) are equivalent and that both conditions are independent of r  >  0 was proved in [\cite=Z] when n = 1, though the case n > 1 is analogous. Note that (a) implies (b) follows from Lemma [\ref=BerInLpImpSchat] and the easy proof that (b) implies (d) is analogous to the case 0 < p  ≤  1.

We will finish the proof by showing that (c)⇒  (a), so suppose that [formula]. Then by Fubini's theorem and the reproducing property

[formula]

which by Lemma [\ref=PointwiseBound] implies that

[formula]

or [formula]. The proof is now completed by an application of Lemma [\ref=finLpImpTfinSp].
