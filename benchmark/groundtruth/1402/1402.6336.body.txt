A Missing-Link in the Supernova-GRB Connection: The Case of SN 2012ap

Introduction

Ordinary Supernovae

The optical lightcurves of supernovae have been well described by [\citet=1982ApJ...253..785A] as a nearly black body photosphere which recedes into the ejecta, heated by γ-rays from nuclear decay and cooled by rapid expansion with a characteristic velocity of v  ~  104 km s- 1. The interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium set up by the stellar wind of the progenitor star has been described by [\citet=1982ApJ...258..790C] using self similar solutions. Such solutions have also successfully described the radio emission from type Ic supernovae [\citep=1998ApJ...499..810C]. The combination of nearly free expansion leading to decreasing optical thickness from free-free or synchrotron self absorption (SSA) and decreasing magnetic fields produces a decreasing peak frequency (the frequency at which the peak in the radio spectrum occurs), but a nearly constant flux density at the peak frequency [\citep=1998ApJ...499..810C]. In the self-similar solution, this interaction produces a shockfront which expands in a powerlaw fashion, with [formula], where R is the radius of the shockfront, t is the time since shock breakout and m is known as the expansion parameter (also sometimes called the deceleration parameter). In the case of Type Ib/c supernovae, which generally have a relatively tenuous circumstellar medium, this interaction produces little deceleration, and m is close to 1. The ejecta would slow down significantly only after encountering a mass of external medium comparable to the [formula] M[formula] of ejecta expected for Type I b/c supernovae. This Sedov time [\citep=1950RSPSA.201..159T] is expected to be [formula] years for supernovae. Therefore young supernovae are usually found in a Newtonian phase of nearly free expansion.

Gamma Ray Bursts

GRBs were discovered by [\cite=1973ApJ...182L..85K] using the Vela satellites, designed for the detection of nuclear tests in space. Ultra-relativistic blast waves had already been described by fluid dynamical [\citet=1976PhFl...19.1130B] solutions before they were implicated in the production of GRBs [\citep=1986ApJ...308L..47G] [\citep=1986ApJ...308L..43P]. The production of GRBs require the ejecta to have initial bulk Lorentz factors of [formula] [\citep=1999PhR...314..575P] in order to overcome the pair production opacity [\citep=1975NYASA.262..164R] [\citep=1978Natur.271..525S]. Furthermore, even a small number of baryons in the initial ejecta can soak up most of the explosion energy available for γ-rays [\citep=1990ApJ...365L..55S]. This is called baryon poisoning. So GRB jets must have [formula] M[formula] of relativistic ejecta [\citep=1999PhR...314..575P] after breakout from the stellar progenitor surface, so as not to be baryon poisoned. In a short time, this relatively small mass of ejecta encounters a larger mass of external matter. Therefore GRB afterglows are found in a relativistic but rapidly decelerating phase and have [formula]. The broad-lined (high velocity) type Ic SN 1998bw was discovered in the direction of GRB980425 [\citep=1998Natur.395..670G], and was characterized by the bright radio emission from its relativistic ejecta which had Γ  ~  2 - 3 [\citep=1998Natur.395..663K]. This association between a Type Ic supernova and a long GRB was followed by other supernovae like that of GRB030329 with SN 2003dh [\citep=2003Natur.423..847H] and XRF060218 with SN 2006aj [\citep=2006Natur.442.1011P] [\citep=2006Natur.442.1014S] also associated with GRBs. Some of these supernovae were marked by broad lines or by asphericity. Yet the definitive property, of this small subset of Ic supernovae, that let them produce relativistic outflows remains elusive.

Search for relativistic ejecta

This evidence, for a supernova-GRB connection, inspired a systematic search for relativistic ejecta from nearby type Ic supernovae using radio observations, leading to the discovery of SN 2009bb by [\citet=2010Natur.463..513S] with [formula] erg of energy in radio emitting relativistic ejecta. Like GRBs, SN 2009bb had relativistic ejecta [\citep=2010Natur.463..513S] but this ejecta continued to be in nearly free expansion for ~  1 year [\citep=2011NatCo...2E.175C] [\citep=2010ApJ...725....4B], leading to the suggestion, that unlike GRBs, it is baryon loaded [\citep=2011ApJ...729...57C]. It has been suggested by [\citet=2011NatCo...2E.175C] that such engine-driven relativistic supernovae can even accelerate ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Such a baryon loaded fireball has also been implied in PTF11agg [\citep=2013ApJ...769..130C]. A rapid decline in flux density, faster than [formula] at a given radio frequency, or a decreasing peak flux density may signal deceleration of the ejecta. Recently the rapidly declining PTF12gzk was observed with [formula] erg of energy in fast ejecta [\citep=2013ApJ...778...63H]. So far, however, highly energetic ([formula] erg) relativistic ejecta combined with rapid deceleration has never been observed until now in a supernova unassociated with a GRB.

Discovery of SN 2012ap

SN 2012ap was discovered in NGC 1729 by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search [\citep=2012CBET.3037....1J] on 2012 February 10. NGC 1729 is at a distance of [formula] Mpc [\citep=2007ApJS..172..599S], and we will take a distance of 40.0 Mpc in what follows, although we note the dependence on distance where appropriate. The host galaxy was observed on 2012 February 5 and the supernova was not yet detected on that date. Therefore the explosion must have occurred either after or at most a few days before this date. Spectroscopically it was identiﬁed as a type Ic supernova, with broad lines, and marked by similarities with SN 2009bb and the GRB-associated SN 1998bw [\citep=2012CBET.3037....2M]. [\citet=2014ApJ...782L...5M] reported unusually strong diffuse interstellar bands in its optical spectra. [\citet=2014arXiv1402.6344M] report on the non-detection of X-ray emission and therefore indicate a shortlived central engine. [\citet=2014arXiv1408.1606M] models the optical emission from the supernova and infer a explosion date of February 5 with an uncertainty of 2 days.

We detected strong radio emission from the supernova using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) on 2012 February 15.0 UT, with a steep inverted spectrum between 5.0 GHz and 6.75 GHz. The subsequent radio observations using the VLA and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) showed an SSA spectrum (see Figure [\ref=F_nu_t]). See Appendix for details of radio observations and modeling. The peak flux densities and peak frequencies are summarized in Table [\ref=table].

Observations

In this section we describe the observations of SN 2012ap obtained at various wavelengths. The first broadband radio spectrum was obtained at an age of 12 days. The radio data was well described with a SSA spectrum (see Figure [\ref=F_nu_t]). This allowed us to estimate the radius of the emission region [\citep=1998ApJ...499..810C] to be ~  1016 cm. The inferred size evolution as a funtion of time is shown in Figure [\ref=Rt] The expanding ejecta may have slowed down since the time of explosion, therefore this size gives us a lower limit on the initial apparent expansion velocity of 0.4c. This is much faster than all other > 100 nearby type Ibc supernovae in our sample [\citep=2010Natur.463..513S], apart from SN 2009bb. Hence, SN 2012ap was chosen for detailed follow-up as the second relativistic supernova ever found without an associated GRB. This prompted a search for a high energy counterpart using data from all the spacecraft within the InterPlanetary Network (IPN), a group of spacecraft equipped with gamma-ray detectors for localizing GRBs [\citep=2009AIPC.1133...55H]. The locations of the transients are determined by comparing the arrival times of the γ-rays at the different spacecrafts. In the plausible range of explosion dates, 2012 February 5 to 10, there is no evidence for a GRB associated with SN 2012ap down to the IPN threshold of 6  ×  10- 7 erg cm- 2. We looked for transients with even lower fluences using Fermi and Swift, but we found none having small error boxes consistent with the position of the supernova.

Radio Temporal Evolution

No supernova was seen in the host galaxy on a pre-explosion image taken by Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) on February 5 down to an upper limit of 18.7 R magnitude. A subsequent image taken on February 10, revealed SN 2012ap at 17.3 R magnitude. We therefore conclude that the explosion happened before February 10, but not much before February 5. Since one of the major claims of this work, is a deceleration, we count the age of the supernova from the February 5, which is near the beginning of this range. Later dates would imply even more deceleration. [\citet=2014arXiv1408.1606M] models the optical lightcurve and provides an explosion date of February 5  ±  2, which is used in this work and interpreted as a 1σ bound on the explosion date. The present uncertainties of a few days in the explosion date dominates the uncertainty in m.

Both the VLA and GMRT observations have been reduced using Astronomical Image Processing Software (AIPS) standard techniques. Radio Frequency Interference in data was flagged and the interferometric visibilities were amplitude and phase calibrated. Bandpass calibration was done using BPASS based on the flux calibrators 3C48 and/or 3C147. The single source data was extracted using AIPS task SPLIT after final bandpass and flux calibration. The single source data sets were imaged using IMAGR. The images were corrected for the residual phase calibration errors using self-calibration of visibility phases [\citep=1989ASPC....6..185C]. The source flux densities were extracted by fitting Gaussian using task JMFIT assuming point sources. The errors reported on the flux density are obtained by using the image statistics from the region surrounding the source.

These radio observations were used to obtain the values reported in Table [\ref=table] and in Figures [\ref=Rt] and [\ref=BR]. Quoted uncertainties in flux densities are statistical. There may be up to 5% systematic uncertainty from flux density calibration. This dominates the error budget quoted in the final derived values for E0 and [formula].

The full set of radio observations were fit with an SSA model with p = 3, as has been observed in Ic supernovae. Both the peak flux density and peak frequency were allowed to vary as arbitrary powerlaws with an origin at 6th February. A good global fit is obtained with a χ2 = 0.98 per degree of freedom. See Figure [\ref=F_nu_t] for all the radio observations and fit. The radii (Figure [\ref=Rt]) and magnetic fields (Figure [\ref=BR]) reported in Table [\ref=table] are derived from fits to the data at individual epochs.

The dependence of R on the ratio εe  /  εB and f are through a power of 1 / 19, so they are likely to introduce only a negligible systematic uncertainty [\citep=1998ApJ...499..810C]. The dependence on distance is with a power 18 / 19 which could introduce a systematic shift, but not change the expansion parameter. The dependence on the flux density is a power 9 / 19, so a 5% error in flux density will add 2.5% of systematic error to the radii. These errors should be considered above and beyond the statistical uncertainties reported in the table. However, none of them are big enough to significantly change the results reported in this work.

Search for high energy counterpart

Between 2012 February 05 and 2012 February 10, inclusive of both days, a total of 5 bursts were detected by one or more of the nine spacecraft of the InterPlanetary network (IPN: Mars Odyssey, Konus-Wind, RHESSI, INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Swift-BAT, Suzaku, AGILE, MESSENGER, and Fermi (GBM)). All these confirmed bursts were observed by more than one instrument on one or more spacecraft, and could be localized at least coarsely. During the same period, there were also 3 unconfirmed bursts which were observed by one experiment on one spacecraft (the 20-detector Suzaku HXD-WAM) in the triggered (TRN) mode. Their origin is uncertain; they could be cosmic or solar, but too weak to be detected by other IPN spacecraft. In at least one case, it could be particle-induced. They cannot be localized accurately, but analysis of the detector responses indicates that they are unlikely to have originated from the direction of SN 2012ap. Therefore they were excluded from further analysis. No bursts from known sources such as AXPs and SGRs were recorded during this period.

The completeness of our sample can be estimated as follows. We have 3 distinct sets of events: IPN bursts, Fermi GBM-only bursts, and bursts observed by the Swift BAT only within its coded field of view. The IPN is sensitive to bursts with fluences down to about 6  ×  10- 7 erg cm- 2, and observes the entire sky with a temporal duty cycle close to 100% [\citep=2009AIPC.1133...55H]. This places a threshold of [formula] erg on the isotropic equivalent γ-ray energy of any possibly GRB accompanying SN 2012ap if it were to be detected by the IPN. This is a factor ~  6 lower than that of GRB980425 accompanying SN 1998bw.

The Fermi GBM detects bursts down to an 8 to 1000 keV fluence of about 4  ×  10- 8 erg cm- 2, and observes the entire unocculted sky ( 8.8 sr) with a temporal duty cycle of more about 86%. The weakest burst observed by the BAT within its coded field of view had a 15 to 150 keV fluence of 6  ×  10- 9 erg cm- 2, and the BAT observes a field of view of about 2 sr with a temporal duty cycle of about 90%. Generally, the weakest bursts are short-duration GRBs; higher fluences characterize the sensitivities to long-duration GRBs.

The localization accuracies of the 5 confirmed bursts varied widely. None were observed within the coded fields of view of the Swift BAT, INTEGRAL IBIS, or Super-AGILE (several arc minute accuracy). None were observed by MAXI (several degree accuracy). Two were observed either by the Fermi GBM alone, or by the Fermi GBM and one near-Earth spacecraft (so that they could not be localized accurately by triangulation). These bursts had 1 σ statistical-only error radii of 23.8 and 5.5 degrees. The GBM error contours are not circles, although they are characterized as such, and have about 3.2 degrees of systematic uncertainties associated with them. Adding the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature gives a reasonable approximation to a 1 σ error circle, and multiplying that radius by 3 gives a reasonable approximation to a 3 σ (statistical and systematic) error circle. These two Fermi bursts have positions which are inconsistent with that of the SN (that is, the SN falls far outside the 3 σ error circle as approximated above). Two were observed by interplanetary and near-Earth spacecraft, and could be triangulated to small error boxes whose positions exclude the position of SN2012ap. One burst was observed by the Swift BAT outside the coded field of view, and by the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS. As the distance between these two spacecraft is only about 0.5 light-seconds, the event can be triangulated, but not accurately. Its error annulus has an area of 1.8 sr, and it includes the position of the supernova. The total area of the localizations of the 5 confirmed bursts was  0.5 times 4 pi sr. This implies that about 0.5 bursts can be expected to have positions which are consistent with any given point on the sky simply by chance (i.e. within the 3 σ error region). In our sample one burst has a position consistent with the SN position (Poisson probability  0.3).

There is another approach to the probability calculation. Since only 0 or 1 GRB in our sample can be physically associated with the supernova, we can calculate two other probabilities. The first is the probability that, in our ensemble of 5 bursts, none is associated by chance with the supernova. For our ensemble, this probability is 0.54. The second is that any one burst is associated by chance with the SN, and that all the others are not. For our ensemble, that probability is 0.39. Since we find about the expected number of chance coincidences, and since there are no bursts with small error boxes whose positions are consistent with the supernova, there is no strong evidence for a SN-associated GRB within the time window down to the IPN threshold. If the supernova produced a burst below the IPN threshold and above the Fermi one, it is possible that both Swift and Fermi would not detect it; considering their spatial and temporal coverages, the joint non-detection probability is about 0.38. Finally, if the supernova produced a burst below the Fermi threshold but above the Swift one, the probability is about 0.86 that it would not be detected.

In summary, no confirmed coincident burst with an isotropic fluence of more than a sixth of GRB980425 was localized to the direction of SN 2012ap within the relevant time window. Weaker bursts were searched for, albeit with <  100% duty cycle, but also not found.

Interpretation

In this section we describe what conclusions can be drawn about the explosion, its energy budget and its environments based on the observations described above.

Deceleration

As a supernova expands, its radio emitting region becomes optically thinner. The expansion also dilutes the energy density of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields. In the nearly free expansion phase, these two effects conspire [\citep=1998ApJ...499..810C] [\citep=2011ApJ...729...57C] to decrease the turnover frequency of the SSA spectrum but keep the peak flux density nearly constant in time. In the case of SN 2012ap, the peak flux density fell steadily over the first month of observations (see Figure [\ref=F_nu_t]) and the expansion is well fit by a power law of the form, [formula], where [formula]. Here the 1 σ statistical uncertainty is derived from the radio size determinations following [\citet=1998ApJ...499..810C]. However, the determination of the explosion date derived from optical observations [\citep=2014arXiv1408.1606M] presents a greater 1 σ systematic uncertainty of 0.07. This is determined by refitting the data with the range of explosion dates allowed by the optical studies of the supernova. Taking both into account and summing them in quadrature, the total uncertainly in m is 0.08. Therefore our estimate of the expansion parameter is m = 0.74  ±  0.08, which incorporates our understanding of the statistical and systematic uncertainties dominated by the radio observations and time of explosion respectively. This is 3 σ away from a value near 1, expected for undecelerated expansion.

The combination of high velocity and small expansion parameter, place SN 2012ap at an unique position on the Figure [\ref=vm_schem] Within the context of an ordinary type Ic supernova, this would imply a supernova ejecta density profile characterized by a powerlaw distribution of mass ejected at a particular velocity is [formula], where v is the velocity. However, the expulsion of stellar envelopes are expected to produce much steeper ejecta profiles [\citep=1999ApJ...510..379M]. This could plausibly be explained by an extraordinarily energetic supernova with a low ejecta mass and a shallow ejecta profile extending into relativistic velocities. Our observations of SN 2012ap imply much more energy coupled to high velocity ejecta than is expected from realistic explosion models of ordinary core collapse supernovae. The decelerating expansion is however, consistent with a Central Engine Driven EXplosion [\citep=2011ApJ...729...57C] (CEDEX) which put a large amount of energy into a small mass of relativistic ejecta responsible for the radio afterglow which separates itself from the non relativistic ejecta responsible for the optical emission. The decelerating expansion of this component interacting with the wind of the progenitor star is expected to produce (See Appendix) a [formula] behavior consistent with the observations.

Total energy budget

Within the context of such a CEDEX, our radio observations allow us to perform calorimetry of the fireball responsible for this radio afterglow. The initial energy in the relativistic component can be estimated as (See Appendix for derivation and assumptions),

[formula]

Using the SSA spectral fits from age 18 days, the epoch with the smallest fractional uncertainties in peak flux density Fνp and peak frequency νp, we estimate [formula] erg of energy in the relativistic ejecta. This estimate is robust, irrespective of whether one chooses a relativistic or Newtonian blastwave model. This energy is comparable to the energy observed in the relativistic outflows from SN 2009bb and supernovae such as SN 1998bw associated with sub-energetic GRBs in the local Universe. This energy estimate forces the plausible combinations of ejected mass and initial velocity (see Figure [\ref=momemass]) to lie in a narrow region above of and parallel to the magenta line for 1049 erg.

Circumstellar density

In addition, the model allows us to derive (See Appendix) the mass loss rate of the progenitor, responsible for the circumstellar interaction. Again using the data from age 18 days, we estimate the pre-explosion mass loss rate between [formula] and [formula], depending on whether one uses a relativistic or Newtonian blastwave model respectively. This range of values is consistent with the expected mass loss rate of Wolf Rayet stars [\citep=2000A&A...360..227N] and is comparable to the case of SN 2009bb [\citep=2010Natur.463..513S]. The upper limit on the mass loss rate, derived by [\citet=2014arXiv1402.6344M] using X-ray non detection from the Chandra X-ray observations, rules out the higher mass loss rate derived from the non-relativistic model. This encourages us to prefer the lower one of these values. Hence, we prefer the relativistic blaswave model. Since we find the radio afterglow of SN 2012ap in a decelerating phase, its relativistic outflow must have already swept up a mass of circumstellar matter more than its own mass. This can put an upper limit on the mass of the relativistic ejecta, which is easily estimated since we have already determined the circumstellar density and blastwave radius. This argument constrains the mass of the relativistic ejecta to be [formula]. This restricts the allowed range of initial parameters for SN 2012ap (see yellow box in Figure [\ref=momemass]). Hence, the mass of the ejecta component powering the radio afterglow of SN 2012ap is much less than that responsible for the optical lightcurve of a typical supernova and closer to the estimated mass of the relativistic component of a GRB's ejecta.

Discussion

Even though no GRB counterpart was found for SN 2012ap, its radio afterglow shares remarkable characteristics with those of GRB associated supernovae; it has a relativistic ejecta component with relatively few baryons. While SN 2009bb had a relativistic outflow, it was clearly baryon loaded which is not the case here. A rapid radio decline has been observed in PTF12gzk which may also have had fast ejecta. But SN 2012ap had orders of magnitude more energy in relativistic ejecta, putting its energetics firmly in the class of GRB-associated supernovae. SN 2012ap pushes the boundaries of explosion parameters observed from stripped core progenitors with central engines (see Figures [\ref=vm_schem] and [\ref=momemass]). The parameters that separate the outflows, from GRB associated supernovae and ordinary Type Ib/c supernovae, according to [\citet=2011ApJ...729...57C] are the velocity and baryon loading of their fastest ejecta. According to [\citet=2014arXiv1402.6344M] the duration of central engine activity drives the diversity of explosion outcomes. By bridging the gap between ordinary supernovae and GRB associated supernovae in terms of its high velocity and low ejecta mass, SN 2012ap demonstrates the role of CEDEXs in understanding the supernova-GRB connection.

Blastwave Evolution

We follow the derivation of the blastwave evolution derived for a CEDEX [\citep=2011ApJ...729...57C]. We consider a simple collisional model [\citep=1999PhR...314..575P] [\citep=1999ApJ...512..699C] where the relativistic ejecta interacts with the circumstellar matter and forms a decelerating shell. The ejecta is characterized by the rest frame mass M0 of the shell launched by a CEDEX and its initial Lorentz factor γ0. The total energy is given by E0  =  γ0M0c2. For a progenitor with mass loss rate of [formula] through a wind with velocity vw, the ejecta sweeps up AR (where [formula] and the circumstellar density falls off as [formula]) amount of circumstellar matter within a radius R. This slows down the ejecta whose Lorentz factor evolves as,

[formula]

according to [\citet=2011ApJ...729...57C].

For both the prototypical SN 2009bb and the newly discovered SN 2012ap, the blastwave was not ultra-relativistic at the time of the observed radio afterglow. Without a large relativistic beaming effect, the observer would receive emission from the entire shell of apparent lateral extent Rlat at a time tobs given by

[formula]

Radio observations of SN 2012ap measure essentially this transverse Rlat, not the line of sight R. Substituting βγ using Equation [\ref=Gt] and integrating gives us a large and unintuitive expression for Rlat(t) which is not quoted here. Since we find SN 2012ap in a decelerating phase, we take the limit of M0  →  0 holding E0 constant. This brings us to the portion of the full solution where the swept up mass is more than the ejecta mass. Furthermore, since the explosion is still relativistic, we know that we are still in the early phase and therefore expand the solution as a power series around t = 0. This gives us the intermediate asymptotic solution for the lateral expansion of the blastwave in its decelerating but relativistic phase, as

[formula]

We suggest that this explains the [formula] evolution of the apparent size of SN 2012ap.

Radio Emission

The radio emission is powered by synchrotron losses suffered by accelerated electrons in shock amplified magnetic fields. Assuming that a fraction εe of the total energy is used to accelerate electrons into a power law with index p = 3 extending from γm to ∞   filling a fraction f of the volume, gives us the normalization of the electron distribution as,

[formula]

Similar assumptions give the average magnetic field as

[formula]

Once we have the evolution of N0 and B, we can get the optically thick and thin portions of the SSA spectrum as [\citep=1979rpa..book.....R],

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively, where c1, c5 and c6 are constants [\cite=1970ranp.book.....P] and D is the distance to the source. In a mildly relativistic cases such as SN 2012ap, we may receive radiation from the entire disk projected on the sky, hence R is to be understood as Rlat. We then substitute for N0 and B from Equations [\ref=N0] and [\ref=B] and the leading order expansion for the projected lateral radius from Equation [\ref=RL]. The optically thick and thin regimes meet at the turnover frequency of

[formula]

with a flux density of

[formula]

Such an evolution of the SSA spectrum is qualitatively similar to that of type Ibc supernovae, in the way the peak flux density decreases with time for both of them. But it is distinctly different in the way that the peak flux density decreases in this case, while it is nearly constant for supernovae in the nearly free expansion phase.

Diagnostic Expressions

In practice, the parameters of the explosion are not known a priori but the peak flux density and frequency can be determined through observations. Therefore, the above expressions must be inverted to solve for the explosion energy and circumstellar density from the observed parameters. The expression for the explosion energy is most useful when put in terms of observable quantities. We substitute the values of the constant c's and assume that εe  =  εB = 0.1 and γm = 100 as is appropriate for a mildly relativistic shock. This gives us

[formula]

The circumstellar density can be derived in a similar fashion. This gives us, within the context of this relativistic blastwave model,

[formula]

We make a further assumption that the wind speed was vw = 1000kms -  1 as is appropriate for a Wolf Rayet progenitor. Using the data from age 18 days, we estimate the pre-explosion mass loss rate as [formula].

The above model is strictly true for highly relativistic blastwaves, while the observed explosion is only mildly relativistic. We therefore, also consider the Newtonian limit to see if it gives systematically different results. The entire calculation can be redone in the context of the Newtonian Sedov-Taylor-like blastwave. The final result for the explosion energy remains the same, indicating that the calorimetric estimate of the explosion energy is robust. The expression for the circumstellar density changes to,

[formula]

This gives us an estimate of [formula]. The real mass loss rate is possibly in between these two systematically different estimates. Upper limits on the mass loss rate from [\citet=2014arXiv1402.6344M] rule out this higher mass loss rate and are consistent with the results from the relativistic model.
