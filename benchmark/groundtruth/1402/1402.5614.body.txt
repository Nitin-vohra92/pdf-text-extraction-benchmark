Exploring GLIMPSE Bubble N107

Introduction

Bubble N107 (SIMBAD: ) is one of the largest bubbles in the catalogue by [\citet=2006apj...649..759c]. This catalogue is based on the infrared observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, (GLIMPSE survey, [\citealp=2003pasp..115..953b]) and contains more than 300 bubbles found in the interstellar medium (ISM) near the Galactic Plane. The catalogue was later expanded by [\citet=2012mnras.424.2442s] to more than 5000 bubbles, which were identified by a community of over 35  000 volunteers. These bubbles, with typical radii less than [formula], are examples of shell-like structures - features found in the ISM all over our Galaxy. Other examples are shells in catalogues by [\citet=1979apj...229..533h] [\citet=1984apjs...55..585h] [\citet=2005a&a...437..101e], with sizes up to [formula]; or dusty "loops" discovered in the IRAS full-sky survey by [\citet=2004a&a...418..131k] and [\citet=2007a&a...463.1227k].

The varying sizes and masses of these structures suggest different mechanisms responsible for their creation. These mechanisms, which do not have to act solely, include:

feedback from massive (OB) stars: radiation, winds and supernovae (see refs. below);

infall of high-velocity clouds into the Galactic disc (e.g. [\citealp=1984apjs...55..585h] [\citealp=1988ara&a..26..145t] [\citealp=1996a&a...313..478e]);

energy and mass inserted by gamma-ray bursts (e.g. [\citealp=1998apj...501l.163e] [\citealp=1998apj...503l..35l] [\citealp=1999a&a...350..457e]); and

turbulence ([\citealp=2005apj...630..238d]).

Bubble N107, as most of the GLIMPSE bubbles, is likely a result of stellar feedback [\citep=2006apj...649..759c] [\citep=2010a&a...523a...6d], which may follow three different models:

An expanding region, assuming radiative heating and ionisation of hydrogen by UV photons from a massive star [\citep=1954ban....12..187k] [\citep=1955apj...121....6O] [\citep=1978ppim.book.....s]. The pressure inside the region is higher compared to the ambient neutral medium, so the region expands and collects the neutral material in an expanding shell.

A wind-blown bubble, supposing that energy is released via stellar winds [\citep=1975apj...200l.107c] [\citep=1977apj...218..377w]. Such a bubble, formed around a massive star, can be divided into several layers: an innermost layer, where the wind is freely expanding up to a layer of shocked stellar wind, where its kinetic energy is thermalised. This layer of the shocked wind is followed by a layer of swept up ISM, which in later stages of evolution is mainly atomic and molecular.

A supernova explosion, supposing an abrupt energy input into the ISM, producing an expanding shell/remnant [\citep=1974apj...188..501c].

These different models of stellar feedback were also discussed by [\citet=1988ara&a..26..145t] [\citet=1996a&a...313..478e] and [\citet=1999a&a...350..457e].

The shell-like structures can trigger star formation, since they consist of a layer of cold and dense material. In the so-called collect-and-collapse scenario [\citep=1977apj...214..725e] [\citep=1994apj...427..384e] [\citep=1994mnras.268..291w], the shell fragments and creates a new generation of stars. Radiation driven implosion [\citep=1990a&a...233..190d] [\citep=1994a&a...289..559l] considers the compression of preexisting condensations (globules) by the pressure of the ionised gas. A brief review of these and other triggering mechanisms is given in a study of GLIMPSE bubbles by [\citet=2010a&a...523a...6d].

In this paper, we present a multiwavelength study of one of the largest GLIMPSE bubbles: N107, which lies in the central plane of the Galactic disc ([formula], [formula]). A multiwavelength, colour picture of N107 is shown in fig. [\ref=fig_n107_multi_co].

The paper is organised in the following way: In section [\ref=sec_observation], we complement the Spitzer infrared observations with line observations from the I-GALFA survey [\citep=2010hia....15..788k], CO ([formula]) line observations from the GRS survey [\citep=2006apjs..163..145j] and radio continuum observations at 1420 and [formula] from the VGPS [\citep=2006aj....132.1158s] and WSRT [\citep=1996apjs..107..239t] surveys. From the line observations, we derive the bubble's LSR radial velocity (RV), kinematical distance and masses of the molecular and atomic components. From the radio continuum observations, we derive the flux densities and corresponding spectral indices of two radio sources lying apparently inside the bubble. In section [\ref=sec_analysis_of_molecular_clumps], we use a recently published algorithm DENDROFIND [\citep=2012a&a...539a.116w] to decompose the molecular gas associated with the bubble into individual clumps and derive the slope of the clump mass function. In section [\ref=sec_simulations], we use the numerical code ring [\citep=1990iaus..144p.101p] [\citep=1996a&a...313..478e] to simulate the bubble's evolution in order to estimate its age, energy input and the size and mass of the molecular cloud from which the bubble evolved. Finally, a discussion and conclusions are presented in sections [\ref=sec_discussion] and [\ref=sec_conclusion].

Observation of Bubble N107

Data Sources

GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire, [\citealp=2003pasp..115..953b]) and MIPSGAL [\citep=2009pasp..121...76c] are two complementary infrared surveys mapping the Galactic disc with the Spitzer Space Telescope. GLIMPSE used instrument IRAC (Infrared Array Camera) which has four channels centred around 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and [formula], for which the point response function FWHM is between [formula] and [formula]. MIPSGAL used the instrument MIPS (Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer) with a broadband channel centred around [formula], for which the point spread function FWHM is 6 arcsec .

I-GALFA (Inner-Galaxy ALFA Low-Latitude Survey, [\citealp=2010hia....15..788k]) is part of a large project called GALFA- [\citep=2011apjs..194...20p], which plans to map the entire sky observable by the Arecibo Observatory in the line. The FWHM beam size of the Arecibo telescope at [formula] is [formula] with the GALFA- radial velocity channel width of [formula]. The data are provided in FITS cubes of the brightness temperature [formula]. The single-channel standard deviation of the gaussian noise [formula] is about [formula].

The GRS (Galactic Ring Survey, [\citealp=2006apjs..163..145j]) is a CO ([formula]) survey focused on the Galactic molecular ring. The survey used the FCRAO 14-m telescope, with a FWHM beam size of 46 arcsec  and a radial velocity channel width of [formula]. The data are provided in FITS cubes of the antenna temperature [formula], with a typical noise [formula]. We converted the data to the main-beam brightness temperature: [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the main beam efficiency (value suggested by [\citealp=2006apjs..163..145j]).

VGPS (VLA Galactic Plane Survey, [\citealp=2006aj....132.1158s]) is a [formula] continuum and line survey of the Galactic disc based on the interferometric observations done with the VLA (Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array). We use only the continuum observations since for the , data from I-GALFA are available with significantly lower noise. The FWHM beam size is [formula] and the gaussian noise is [formula], for the continuum observations.

WSRT (Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope survey, [\citealp=1996apjs..107..239t]) is a [formula] continuum survey of the Galactic plane utilising the WSRT interferometer in the Netherlands. The FWHM resolution is [formula] in the right ascension and declination (Î´) direction, respectively. This yields for N107 ([formula]) the FWHM resolution of [formula]. The median gaussian noise is [formula].

The UKIDSS (UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey) project is defined in [\citet=2007MNRAS.379.1599L]. UKIDSS uses the UKIRT (United Kingdom Infrared Telescope) Wide Field Camera (WFCAM; [\citealp=2007A&A...467..777C]) and a photometric system described in [\citet=2006MNRAS.367..454H]. The pipeline processing and science archive are described in [\citet=2004SPIE.5493..411I] and [\citet=2008MNRAS.384..637H]. We used data from the 7th data release.

Dust Component

The bubble's outline is most prominent in the [formula] maps from the GLIMPSE survey, where it was discovered by [\citet=2006apj...649..759c], who derived its basic properties: mean position of [formula], [formula]; mean radius of [formula] and a mean thickness of [formula]. Most emission at [formula] is coming from the bubble edges, forming a ring-like structure. The [formula] channel is dominated by the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ([\citealp=2003ara&a..41..241d]; [\citealp=2006aj....131.1479r]; [\citealp=2013arep...57..573p]). PAHs, which are destroyed in the ionised regions, are tracing the photodissociation regions (PDRs), edges of molecular clouds illuminated by the UV radiation from a massive star. The UV radiation pervades the PDRs and excites the PAHs herein.

Counterpart emission at [formula] was observed in MIPSGAL [\citep=2009pasp..121...76c]. Contrary to the [formula] continuum, emission at [formula] is filling part of the bubble's interior. The [formula] continuum is dominated by the emission of very small grains - dust grains larger than PAHs - heated by a nearby massive star [\citep=2013arep...57..573p].

A dark hole is present in the southwestern part of the bubble's interior. Almost no emission from dust, and also no emission of CO or (see below), is observed there. Fig. [\ref=fig_n107_multi_co] shows a multiwavelength, colour picture of N107 composed of the [formula] and [formula] continuum emission and the CO line emission integrated over the radial velocities of 38.5 to [formula].

Atomic Component

We searched the data cubes by eye for features possibly associated with bubble N107. An shell, morphologically similar to N107, is located around the central LSR radial velocity of [formula]. Note that an incomplete ring of CO clumps is present at similar radial velocities (see sec. [\ref=sec_molecular_component]). The emission is located along the bubble edges, protruding outside farther than the CO emission, forming an atomic envelope of the whole structure. Maps of the brightness temperature in several velocity channels are shown in fig. [\ref=fig_igalfa].

Fig. [\ref=fig_igalfa_lv] shows a map of the galactic longitude versus radial velocity (l-v diagram). The front wall is very faint, located at a radial velocity of [formula]. The back wall is more distinct, located at a radial velocity of [formula]. Between these radial velocities, a hole is apparent inside the bubble. The relative expansion velocity of the front versus back wall is [formula].

In order to measure the mass associated with the bubble, we define the following 3D aperture (aperture 1, see also fig. [\ref=fig_apertures], left panel): radius of two times that of N107, [formula], and the radial velocity channels from 32.7 to [formula] inclusive. All the pixels lying within this aperture contribute to the measured mass.

To derive the mass of the neutral hydrogen, we use the optically thin limit of line radiative transfer. Then, the column density [formula] can be computed from the formula [\citep=1996tra..book.....r]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the observed brightness temperature of the gas and, in our case of an I-GALFA data cube, the integral takes form of a sum over a set of pixels with [formula].

The Galactic emission has a strong background component. To estimate it, we assume that the bubble's interior is evacuated, so the emission observed apparently near the bubble centre is due to this background, not associated with the bubble. We defined another 3D aperture with the radius half that of the N107 and the radial velocity channels from 39.1 to [formula] (see fig. [\ref=fig_apertures]). This aperture encloses a volume in the central part of the bubble. The mean [formula] within this region is [formula], which we adopt as the background component and subtract it before computing the mass.

Furthermore, in the process of mass derivation, we need to know the distance to N107. Considering also the CO emission (see below), we adopt the central radial velocity of [formula]. The Galactic rotation model of [\citet=1993a&a...275...67b] gives for that radial velocity two kinematical distances: 3.6 and [formula]. We adopt the near one of [formula], which yields the bubble mean radius of [formula] ([formula]). The near distance is favoured by the estimated virial masses of the molecular clumps found along the bubble borders. For the far distance of [formula], we got 22 of 49 clumps with supervirial masses, while for the near distance of [formula], we got only 2 clumps with virial masses above 1 (clumps 7 and 21 in tab. [\ref=tab_clumps_full]). Note that [\citet=2006apj...649..759c] suggest distances of 4.7/[formula]. They use the same rotation model as we do, however with a less reliable determination of the radial velocity obtained from the observation of coincident regions. They advocate also the near kinematical distance.

To estimate the uncertainty of the measured mass, we use the standard Taylor formula:

[formula]

where f is the measured value (in our case the mass), Ïf is its uncertainty, which is derived from uncertainties Ïxi of variables xi on which f depends (in our case e.g. the distance to N107).

The resulting mass associated with N107, i.e. the total mass within aperture 1 after subtracting the background, is [formula]. The major sources of uncertainty are the distance to N107 and the background emission. Assuming the distance uncertainty of 10 % ([formula]) and the background uncertainty of [formula], the total mass uncertainty is about 20 %, i.e. [formula].

Molecular Component

Around the radial velocity of [formula], CO emission is present along the bubble borders. Maps of the CO emission (fig. [\ref=fig_grs]) show that CO gas forms clumps, which are distributed in a ring-like structure along the edges of the bubble, protruding outside. Almost no emission is coming from the interior. Around the radial velocity of [formula], the CO emission merges with another complex of molecular clouds, while in the channels below [formula], CO emission vanishes.

To measure the associated molecular mass, we use two 3D apertures (see fig. [\ref=fig_apertures], right panel). Aperture 1 is same as that for measuring the mass. Aperture 2 is smaller, with radius [formula], radial velocity channels from 38.8 to [formula] inclusive and covers only the immediate vicinity of the bubble, i.e. only the mass accumulated in the expanding shell. Note that for comparing the observation and simulations, we use the molecular mass found within aperture 2. We treat the radiative transfer in the line of CO ([formula]), described in [\citet=1996tra..book.....r]. First, we derive the optical depth:

[formula]

where [formula] is the excitation temperature, which we assume to be [formula]. [formula] is the brightness temperature of the CO line; [formula] is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background and

[formula]

where h is the Planck constant; k is the Boltzmann constant and [formula] is the CO ([formula]) line frequency. Assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium, characterised by a single excitation temperature [formula], we can compute the CO column density from the formula [\citep=1996tra..book.....r]:

[formula]

where, in our case of the GRS data cube, [formula] and the integral becomes a sum over a desired range of pixels. From the CO column density, the H2 column density is derived assuming the abundance [\citep=1998gaas.book.....b] [formula]. Finally, the total mass of the molecular matter [formula] is computed using the standard solar hydrogen abundance X:

[formula]

and [formula] is the mass in the form of the molecular hydrogen. Note that we use term molecular matter or molecular mass to refer to the matter found in molecular clouds, i.e. a mixture of H2, He, CO and trace amounts of other molecules, elements and dust. The distance to N107 ([formula]) is discussed above in section [\ref=sec_atomic_component].

The total molecular mass within aperture 1 is [formula], from which [formula] in in the form of H2, rest in helium and heavier elements. The total molecular mass within aperture 2 (in the expanding shell only) is [formula], from which [formula] is in the form of H2. The major source of uncertainty is the CO abundance. We used [formula] [\citep=1998gaas.book.....b]. Observations and models show, however, that the abundance varies for different clouds and depends also on the physical conditions inside individual clumps [\citep=2007apjs..168...58s] [\citep=2009a&a...503..323v] [\citep=1999rpph...62..143w]. Another source of the uncertainty we consider is the distance to N107. Using eq. [\ref=eq_uncertainty_propagation] and assuming the CO abundance uncertainty of 20 % and the distance uncertainty of 10 % ([formula]), the uncertainty of the molecular masses given above is about 30 %.

Radio Continuum and Spectral Index

Since an region was identified in the direction of the bubble [\citep=2003a&a...397..213p] and also the [formula] emission is present inside the bubble, we expected to observe its radio continuum counterpart.

Both the VGPS ([formula]) and WSRT ([formula]) surveys show a distinct diffuse radio source located apparently within the bubble, in its eastern (left) part, slightly below the area, where the [formula] emission is strongest (see fig. [\ref=fig_radio_continuum]). Beside this source, the bubble interior is filled with much fainter radio emission. Another diffuse radio source is present further east of the bubble ([formula], [formula]). This source is associated with a complex of molecular material found at radial velocities of about [formula], so it is likely not associated with the bubble. Fig. [\ref=fig_vgps_multi] shows a comparison of the VGPS radio continuum with the emission at [formula] and [formula]. Inside the bubble, the radio continuum follows the bubble outline defined by the PAHs emission at [formula]. In the northern (top) and western (right) part, the radio continuum is mixed with the emission of very small grains at [formula], while in the eastern part (left), the [formula] emission vanishes and only the radio continuum is observed.

We measured the radio flux densities in four regions: two located apparently within the bubble - defined by apertures A and B - and two located outside the bubble - defined by apertures C and D (fig. [\ref=fig_radio_continuum]). Aperture A covers the distinct source in the eastern part of the bubble (source "A"), while aperture B covers the faint emission in its western (right) part (source "B"). Aperture C covers part of the fainter emission outside the bubble (source "C") and aperture D covers the distinct radio source located eastern of the bubble (source "D"). We subtracted a background derived from flux within an aperture covering a relatively homogeneous region free of visible radio sources (fig. [\ref=fig_radio_continuum]). Then we used the two fluxes at 1420 and [formula] to derive the spectral index Î± for both sources A and B:

[formula]

where S1, S2 are the fluxes at frequencies f1, f2. Note that the theoretical spectral index for a classical region in the optically thin limit is - 0.1 [\citep=2010era.book......c], although the usually observed values are around 0 or more [\citep=1996tra..book.....r] [\citep=1988gera.book.....k]. In distinction to regions, the mean observed spectral index of supernova remnants is - 0.5 (average value in catalogue of [\citealt=2009ycat.7253....0g]). The measured flux densities and the derived spectral indices are presented in table [\ref=tab_radio].

The spectral index of source A of - 0.3 suggests a nonthermal (synchrotron) contribution to the received radio flux: a supernova remnant. No known supernova remnant is associated, yet, with that radio source. For source B, the spectral index of â  0 suggests a thermal origin of the flux: a classical region. The spectral indices of sources C (- 0.2) and D (- 0.1) suggest that part of their emission is also nonthermal.

Analysis of Molecular Clumps

We decomposed the molecular ring associated with N107 into individual molecular clumps with the program DENDROFIND, described in the appendix of [\citet=2012a&a...539a.116w]. DENDROFIND processes data cubes - typically position-position-velocity data cubes of the brightness temperature [formula] - and outputs a list of molecular clumps organised in a hierarchical structure, which can be represented by a dendrogram [\citep=2008ApJ...679.1338R]. In our case, the data cube is a cutout of the CO GRS data and has two spatial dimensions (galactic longitude, galactic latitude) and one radial velocity dimension. Each clump consists of a dense core surrounded by a less dense molecular envelope. The core is observed as a local [formula] peak. DENDROFIND is controlled by four parameters: Nlevels sets the number of steps by which it goes through the data cube when searching for clump peaks; Npxmin sets the minimal number of pixels which can form a clump; Tcutoff sets the minimal [formula] which is yet considered a signal, pixels with lower [formula] are discarded; dTleaf sets the minimal height of a local peak to be considered a clump's core; a higher dTleaf will merge more clumps. Parameters Tcutoff and dTleaf are designed to be set to a value of â  3   Ã   the noise level. We ran DENDROFIND with the following parameters: [formula], [formula], [formula], where [formula] is the estimated standard deviation of the gaussian noise found within our N107 cutout of the CO GRS data. Note that this value is slightly greater then the 'typical' value of the entire GRS of [formula] given in the paper of [\citet=2006apjs..163..145j].

In order to select only the clumps associated with bubble N107, we took only those clumps of which cores lie within the aperture 2 used for measuring the total molecular mass (sec. [\ref=sec_molecular_component]).

Table [\ref=tab_clumps] lists the identified molecular clumps. Note that only the first 10 clumps with the highest core [formula] are shown there; a complete list is available in an online appendix (tab. [\ref=tab_clumps_full]). The meaning of the columns is as follows: N is the number identifying a clump in our list; [formula], [formula], [formula] are the galactic longitude, galactic latitude and LSR radial velocity, respectively, of the brightest pixel of the clump. [formula] is the brightness temperature of the brightest pixel. R is the clump equivalent radius, defined as

[formula]

where [formula] is the clump projected area in the sky. FWHM is the clump full width at half maximum computed as

[formula]

where xâ{l, b, v}. The second term under the big square root represents the pixel resolution term and ensures that the FWHM is not smaller than the pixel size. For the GRS data cube, the pixel size Îx is [formula], which corresponds at N107's distance of [formula] to [formula]. If Îx goes to zero, the FWHM approaches the gaussian FWHM. Ï2x is the variance weighted by the brightness temperature [formula]:

[formula]

[formula]

with the summation taken over all pixels belonging to the clump. M is the clump mass, which is the total mass of pixels belonging to the clump, derived from equations [\ref=eq_tau_13co]-[\ref=eq_mmol] (sec. [\ref=sec_molecular_component]). The error of the clump mass, assuming gaussian noise and neglecting pixel correlation within the beam, is

[formula]

where [formula] is the number of pixels of the clump and [formula] is the [formula] equivalent mass. In our case of the GRS CO data cubes, [formula]. [formula] is the clump virial mass, estimated as [\citep=1988apj...333..821m]:

[formula]

The formula above assumes a spherical clump with a density profile [formula]. ÎMvir is the virial mass error derived from the first order Taylor expansion of eq. [\ref=eq_mvir], assuming the clump's area and FWHMv errors of one pixel.

Fig. [\ref=fig_clumps_histogram] shows a histogram of clumps masses. Overlaid is a line representing a fit by a function [formula], where Î± is the slope of the clump mass function and C is some constant. We used least-square fitting on a logarithmic scale, i.e. we fit the log of the bin heights [formula] by a function [formula]. The best fitting slope is Î±  =   - 1.1. The bins in the histogram have variable widths, set so that each contains 7 clumps. This ensures that all bins have the same significance.

Numerical Simulations of Bubbles and Comparison with N107

We simulated the evolution of bubbles formed in the ISM around massive stars in order to estimate parameters of N107, which cannot be derived directly from observation (esp. its age). We used a version of the FORTRAN code ring [\citep=1990iaus..144p.101p] [\citep=1996a&a...313..478e], which was originally written for simulations of expanding shells in the Galactic ISM.

Code Description

The simulation starts with a small spherical shell, which is set according to the wind-blown bubble model of [\citet=1977apj...218..377w] in the pressure-driven snowplough phase. The infinitesimally thin shell (thin-shell approximation) is divided into nl  Ã  np elements. We solve the equations of motion including the pressure difference between the shell interior and exterior and the mass accumulation of the ambient medium. We do not include gravity or any other force acting on the shell. The momentum equation for an element is

[formula]

where m is the element mass, [formula] is the element velocity, [formula] is the element surface and [formula] and [formula] are the interior and exterior pressures. The total number of elements is fixed (we used 30  Ã  60), so their surface and mass grow with time. The mass growth is given by the equation

[formula]

where Ï is the local density of the ambient medium.

For the sake of simplicity, an energy source is represented as a continuous and constant energy input [formula]. For each timestep a corresponding amount of energy is added to the bubble interior and a new value of the interior pressure is computed as

[formula]

where [formula] is the interior thermal energy and V is the bubble volume. Eq. [\ref=eq_new_pi] assumes that the interior is filled with monoatomic gas expanding adiabatically. In the case of a shell expanding into a uniform medium, this type of energy source gives for the shell radius, as a function of time, a power-law with an index 3 / 5. This is in between the power-law index 2 / 5, given by a single (supernova) explosion and the power-law index 4 / 7, valid for an expanding region.

The motion of the bubble elements is integrated using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive timestep.

Simulation Setup

We assume a bubble expanding in a molecular cloud with a 3D gaussian density profile (see fig. [\ref=fig_ring_model]):

[formula]

where n is the particle density, n0 is the particle density in the centre of the cloud; Ïx, Ïy, Ïz are the gaussian thicknesses (standard deviation) in the x, y, z direction; x0, y0, z0 specify the location of the cloud centre.

We also assume the centre of expansion is shifted/dislocated from the centre of the cloud by Îr0 towards direction (- x, - y). In the code, the expansion centre (bubble centre) is located at x = y = z = 0, so we shift the cloud centre by Îr0 in the xy plane:

[formula]

We assume a hydrogen abundance of X  =  0.735, helium abundance of Y  =  0.245, metallicity of Z  =  0.02, and a mean relative particle weight of metals of 16.65. We also assume that all hydrogen in the cloud is in the form of H2. This yields a mean relative particle weight of the molecular matter of Î¼  =  2.34. The molecular material of the cloud is isothermal with the temperature set at [formula]. We also consider the atomic gas component, which is represented by a density background with the constant value of 4 hydrogen atoms per cm3 and a temperature of [formula]. The total initial energy of the bubble is set to [formula] and each time step Î´t the energy is increased by [formula].

Comparison with Observation

We ran a series of simulations in order to find the parameters which produce a bubble with similar mass distribution and expansion velocity as N107. The varying input parameters for ring were the energy input ([formula]), the shift/dislocation of the expansion centre from the cloud centre (Îr0), the gaussian thickness of the cloud in the direction of our line of sight (Ïz) and the total mass of the molecular cloud (M0). The gaussian thickness in the sky plane Ïxy  =  Ïx  =  Ïy was kept constant at [formula], which is comparable to the radius of N107. For each set of these parameters, the code evolves a bubble in time and outputs a chain of its snapshots in given time intervals.

Because the bubble is expanding in an inhomogeneous, non-spherical density field, the elements facing a lower density expand faster. This causes the bubble's geometrical centre to move progressively towards the direction of a lower density. To compensate for this drift, we centred each snapshot at the bubble's geometrical centre, which is computed as the mean (x,y,z) coordinates of the bubble elements weighted by their surfaces. We projected these centred snapshots onto FITS data cubes with two spatial (XY) and one radial velocity (RV) dimensions with the same pixel size as in the GRS data cube.

The radiation from OB stars illuminating molecular clouds creates a layer of dissociated matter. This layer then serves as a shield against the radiation and prevents it from penetrating further inside. The dissociated matter will not contribute to the CO line brightness temperature. To account for that, before computing the CO line brightness temperature, we decreased the surface density of each bubble element by [formula]. This value is based on the suggestion for shielding by [\citet=2009apj...693..216k]. We assume that the CO abundances are the same as we used for measuring the observed molecular mass in sec. [\ref=sec_molecular_component]. Then we derived for each pixel the corresponding brightness temperature of the CO ([formula]) line. Finally, we applied convolution to simulate the FCRAO telescope resolution used in the GRS. The resulting FITS thus represents an image, which would be seen by FCRAO if it observed the simulated bubble at a given evolution time.

We define a goodness-of-fit parameter Î´, to compare the synthetic data cubes to the observations:

[formula]

Lower values of Î´ mean a better fit to (better agreement with) the observed properties of N107. The meaning of the terms is as follows:

[formula]

represents the square of the difference of the bubble expansion velocity between the observed value of N107 ([formula]) and simulated value ([formula]). We adopt the observed bubble expansion velocity of [formula], which is derived from the observations and represents half of the relative velocity of the shell's front and back wall.

[formula]

is a sum taken over four circular sectors of the aperture 2 used for measuring the bubble molecular mass (see sec. [\ref=sec_molecular_component]). This term compares the angular mass distribution between N107 and the simulated bubbles. A visualisation of the sectors is show in fig. [\ref=fig_snaps]. [formula] and [formula] are the simulated ("s") and observed ("o") molecular masses in circular sector i. [formula] and [formula] give the simulated and observed mean radii in sector i, weighted by the brightness temperature:

[formula]

where the sums are taken over the pixels in sector i.

First, we ran a series of simulations with a wider span of the input parameters [formula], r0, Ïz, M0 with steps on a logarithmic scale and the evolution time up to [formula] with snapshots taken every [formula]. Then we located a subset of the input parameters with best fits to the observation (lowest Î´) and ran a second series of simulations with finer parameter resolutions. In the second series, we used linear steps for parameters r0 and Ïz and logarithmic steps for [formula] and M0. The snapshots were taken every [formula] up to [formula]. Note that the internal time step of ring is controlled dynamically by its Runge-Kutta routines; we only set the snapshot printout interval Ît. Parameters for both runs are listed in table [\ref=tab_runs_params]. The ten best fitting runs are shown in table [\ref=tab_bestfits].

To conclude, we simulated the evolution of bubbles formed around massive stars in molecular clouds and compared their properties to N107. We got the best agreement for two groups of parameters:

Group A represents bubbles produced with a lower energy input ([formula]), greater centre-of-expansion dislocation ([formula]), formed within an oblate molecular cloud with the oblateness of (Ïz  /  Ïxy  =  6 / 12), and with a greater evolution time ([formula]).

Group B represents bubbles produced with a higher energy input ([formula]), smaller centre-of-expansion dislocation ([formula]), formed within a prolate molecular cloud ([formula]), with a smaller evolution time ([formula]).

Fits show little sensitivity to the parameter M0 - the initial mass of the surrounding molecular cloud ([formula]). Both groups of the best-fittings-simulations suggest that bubble N107 is relatively young ([formula]) and was formed at the very edge of its parental molecular cloud.

Fig. [\ref=fig_snaps] shows snapshots from the best fitting simulations from both groups A and B and the GRS observation of the CO line.

Discussion

Numerical Simulation Setup, Assumptions and Validity of Approximations

An important assumption for the simulation setup is the shape and density profile of the parental molecular cloud. In our simulations, we chose the gaussian density profile and tested different levels of the oblateness (ratio of Ïz to Ïxy). The oblate shape of the parental molecular clouds which host bubbles similar to N107 is supported by a study of [\citet=2010apj...709..791b], who concluded that the Spitzer bubbles are formed in oblate, sheet-like, molecular clouds with a thickness of a few parsecs. Our simulations, however, favour neither oblate nor prolate clouds.

The numerical code ring assumes the thin-shell approximation, which is applicable so long as the bubble expansion is supersonic, i.e. expanding with a velocity higher than the sound speed of the ambient cold gas: [formula] (for [formula], Î³  =  7 / 5, Î¼  =  2.34). In our runs, almost all the bubble's elements move faster through the ambient gas during the whole bubble evolution, so the thin-shell approximation is reasonable. Moreover, if the speed of an element decreases below the sound speed, the code stops the mass accumulation for that element.

Source of Radio Continuum

The radio continuum emission coming from the direction of the bubble interior has both thermal and nonthermal components. While the strong radio source A is dominated by nonthermal radiation, fainter source B is emitting thermally (fig. [\ref=fig_radio_continuum]). The nonthermal source A is brighter than the thermal source B by almost one order of magnitude, so we can expect that the thermal emission is present in the whole bubble volume, only outshone in aperture A by the nonthermal source. Mixing of thermal and nonthermal radiation in aperture A is also suggested by the visual comparison of the radio continuum and the [formula] emission (fig. [\ref=fig_vgps_multi]). The northern part of aperture A features both the radio continuum and the [formula] emission, while in the southern part only the radio continuum is observed. Further, merging of thermal and nonthermal radiation in aperture A explains why the measured spectral index (- 0.3) is closer to 0 than the typical value for supernova remnants (- 0.5, the average value in the SNRs catalogue of [\citealp=2009ycat.7253....0g]).

The negative spectral indices of sources C (- 0.2) and D (- 0.1) suggest that part of their radio continuum is also emitted by a nonthermal source. The nonthermal contribution to the flux is stronger for source C than for source D. This is expected, since aperture D covers a distinct [formula] (thermal) source, while there is almost no [formula] emission in aperture C (fig. [\ref=fig_vgps_multi]).

Given that first supernovae in an OB association explode only after [formula] or later, and considering the bubble evolution time estimated from simulations ([formula]), no supernova remnant should be present inside the bubble, yet. In other words, our analysis suggests that a supernova remnant, not associated with the bubble, may be present in the direction towards the bubble.

Missing OB Association

We searched the SIMBAD database and a catalogue of Galactic OB stars by [\citet=2003aj....125.2531r] for sources which could be responsible for the bubble creation. However, no OB star, supernova remnant or pulsar is known to lie in the direction of the bubble interior or in its vicinity.

We also performed a search for massive stars possibly related to N107 using the UKIDSS catalogue 7th data release [\citep=2007MNRAS.379.1599L], stellar evolutionary tracks by [\citet=2012MNRAS.427..127B] and the standard model of extinction [\citep=1985ApJ...288..618R]. We derived the extinction for the massive star candidates in the field of N107 and compared it to the values of extinction given for that direction by [\citet=2009MNRAS.400..731S]. The search for massive stars involves many uncertainties, but the comparison of the derived extinctions with independent values is a good test of the credibility of our results. We ended up with six massive star candidates, which lie at distances comparable with the distance of N107 ([formula]). None of these six stars have measured radial velocities. Three of them lie at the rim of the bubble, so they can hardly be its progenitors, but the others are possible energy sources. The selected massive stars are shown in fig. [\ref=fig_ukidss_sources] and listed in table [\ref=tab_ukidss_sources].

Molecular Clump Mass Spectrum

The best fitting slope for the mass spectrum of molecular clumps found along the borders of N107 is - 1.1 (fig. [\ref=fig_clumps_histogram]). This is a significantly shallower slope than that of the classical stellar initial mass function (Salpeter: - 2.35) and also shallower than the clump mass function slope of - 1.6 to - 1.8 derived by [\citet=1998a&a...329..249k]. Note that [\citet=1998a&a...329..249k] used gaussian decomposition for clump identification, which is a fundamentally different method than we used and, moreover, studied different types of clouds - not shell-like as is our case of N107.

The least massive clumps we found have masses about [formula]. This limit is given by the angular resolution and sensitivity of the observations of the CO line. With better resolution and sensitivity, we expect that some clumps, especially the most massive ones, would be identified as several less massive clumps. This would alter the shape of the clump mass spectrum, and likely redistribute the mass of the largest clumps into less massive ones, so that the slope would be steeper.

Conclusion

We studied dust bubble N107, discovered by [\citet=2006apj...649..759c] with infrared observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Radio observations of the and CO ([formula]) lines revealed its atomic and molecular components, which allowed us to determine the bubble radial velocity, kinematical distance and mass of these components. Using the code DENDROFIND [\citep=2012a&a...539a.116w] we decomposed the molecular ring associated with the bubble into 49 individual clumps and found that the clump mass spectrum slope is about - 1.1. Radio continuum observations at 1420 and [formula] suggest the radio flux coming from the bubble direction has both thermal and nonthermal components; i.e., besides a classical region, a supernova remnant contributes to the emission. We simulated the evolution of stellar-blown bubbles within molecular clouds with the numerical code ring [\citep=1990iaus..144p.101p] [\citep=1996a&a...313..478e]. We were able to produce two groups of bubbles with a similar angular mass distribution and expansion velocity as N107: (A) Bubbles formed within an oblate molecular cloud (Ïz  /  Ïxy  =  6 / 12), with the energy input [formula] and the evolution time [formula]. (B) Bubbles formed within a prolate molecular cloud ([formula]), with the energy input [formula] and the evolution time [formula]. Considering the estimated bubble evolution time ([formula]), no supernova remnant should be present inside the bubble, yet. This may be explained by a supernova remnant present in the direction towards the bubble, however not associated with it. A summary of the parameters we derived for bubble N107, together with the parameters given by [\citet=2006apj...649..759c], is presented in table [\ref=tab_summary].
