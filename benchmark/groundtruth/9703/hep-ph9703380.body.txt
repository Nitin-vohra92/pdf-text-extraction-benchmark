Anomalous CP-odd W+W-Z couplings can give rise to a forward-backward asymmetry in the Z angular distribution in the e+e- centre-of-mass frame in the process [formula]. Of the three CP-odd couplings possible, only the imaginary part of one of the couplings, fZ4, which is C odd and P even, contributes to the forward-backward asymmetry. It is found that a limit of the order of 0.1 can be placed on this coupling at a Next Linear Collider with centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV and integrated luminosity of 50 fb- 1.

The second phase of the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) has begun operation. One of the tasks that this LEP2 phase will undertake is the investigation of anomalous W+W-γ and W+W-Z couplings through the process e+e-  →  W+W- [\cite=LEP2]. This investigation would be able to improve limits on such anomalous couplings which might arise in scenarios beyond the standard model (SM). There have also been suggestions to study CP-violating vector boson couplings in e+e-  →  W+W- at LEP2 [\cite=Chang].

While e+e-  →  W+W- can test only a combination of W+W-γ and W+W-Z couplings, the process [formula] would be better suited to probe the WWZ couplings separately. Though this latter process is not feasible of observation at LEP2, it would be significant at higher energies ([formula] GeV) of a future Next Linear Collider (NLC). Studies exist on the sensitivity of NLC to anomalous WWZ couplings through the reaction [formula] [\cite=Bori] [\cite=Ambro] [\cite=deb]. However, these are restricted only to the CP-conserving couplings. We investigate in this work a simple CP-violating asymmetry, viz., the forward-backward (FB) asymmetry in the angular distribution of the Z in the e+e- centre-of-mass (cm) frame, as a signal for CP-odd WWZ couplings.

In general, the CP-violating part of the most general Lorentz-invariant effective WWZ coupling [formula], representing the process [formula], is given by [\cite=Hagi]

[formula]

The couplings f4,f6 and f7 (we suppress the superscript Z now onwards) are momentum dependent and complex in the general case. The overall coupling constant gWWZ  =    -  g cos θW, where g is the usual semi-weak coupling, and θW is the weak mixing angle.

The forward-backward (FB) asymmetry of Z, related to an asymmetry in the variable

[formula]

in the cm frame, is odd under CP. This follows from the fact that under C, [formula], [formula], and under P, [formula], [formula], [formula]. However, cos θZ is even under naive time-reversal TN, which, like P, reverses all momenta. Unlike genuine time-reversal, however, TN does not interchange the initial and final states. cos θZ is therefore CPTN odd.

Let us see what the CPT theorem implies for the dependence of an asymmetry in the variable cos θZ on the parameters of the effective Lagrangian. Observation of a CPTN-odd quantity like cos θZ does not necessarily imply conflict with the CPT theorem since there is no interchange of initial and final states involved. However, in order to avoid conflict with the CPT theorem, quantities which are CPTN-odd can have nonzero values only if the amplitude has an absorptive part. In its absence, the transition matrix is effectively Hermitian, and an interchange of initial and final states envisaged in genuine time reversal does not change the amplitude except for an overall phase factor. The transition amplitudes then have the same essential behaviour under T and T[formula]N. In an effective Lagrangian approach, where we calculate amplitudes only at tree level, this absorptive part could only arise if the couplings in the effective Lagrangian are complex. It can be seen from the effective couplings in eq. (1) that the absorptive contribution could come from Imf4, Ref6 and Ref7, since without absorptive parts, f4 would be real, and f6, f7 purely imaginary from Hermiticity. Thus, from considerations of the CPT theorem, an asymmetry in cos θZ can in principle get nonzero contributions only from Imf4, Ref6, and Ref7.

We find, however, that if the azimuthal angle of Z is integrated over, as in the FB asymmetry, only Imf4 contributes. A search for the FB asymmetry will therefore enable limits to be placed on the single parameter Imf4.

We have calculated the squared matrix element for the process

[formula]

in the standard model, together with the anomalous CP-odd couplings Imf4, Ref6 and Ref7, keeping only the linear terms in the anomalous couplings. The Feynman diagrams contributing to the process ([\ref=reaction]) are shown in Fig. 1. We drop contributions from the SM diagrams which involve Z exchange in the s channel (Fig. 1 (c)). These contributions in SM are known to be negligible for [formula] GeV [\cite=Ambro]. To ensure that this remains true in our case, we can also impose a cut on the Z energy which ensures that the [formula] invariant mass is sufficiently far from the Z mass [\cite=deb]. We choose to apply a somewhat simpler cut, however. We apply a cut of [formula], and have checked that for [formula] GeV, this cut keeps the SM contribution to the cross section from the virtual Z diagrams to less than 1%.

The phase space-integral is carried numerically using Monte Carlo integration. It is found that the only nonzero contribution to the forward-backward asymmetry comes from Imf4. Ref4 as well as the other CP-violating couplings give vanishing asymmetry because of the integration over the azimuthal angles.

We present below the squared matrix element for ([\ref=reaction]) in the approximation mentioned above. The expression for the SM contribution is rather long, and we refer the reader to ref.[\cite=Ambro], where full expressions may be found. Our results agree with those of [\cite=Ambro]. The interference between the matrix elements of the WWZ diagram (that in Fig. 1(a)) from SM and the same diagram from anomalous CP-violating couplings is (we present only the part proportional to Imf4):

[formula]

The interference of the matrix element from the SM involving Z bremsstrahlung from e±, ν, [formula] lines (diagrams in Fig. 1(b) ) and the anomalous WWZ diagram (that of Fig. 1(a)) is:

[formula]

where Ti are given by

[formula]

The differential cross section for the process to first order in Imf4 is given by

[formula]

where EZ, θZ and φ are respectively the Z energy, polar and azimuthal angles in the c.m. frame, and [formula] is the polar angle of the neutrino in the Z rest frame.

The forward-backward asymmetry of the Z with respect to the beam direction, with θZ integrated over the ranges θZ  >  θ0 and θZ  <  π  -  θ0, is defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

As discussed before, AFB(θ0) is proportional to Imf4. A cut on θZ is imposed because in practice, it would be difficult to observe a Z near the forward or backward directions.

We have evaluated σ(θ0) and AFB(θ0) for different energies and [formula]. Fig. 2 shows σ(θ0) as a function of [formula]. In Fig. 3, we have plotted AFB(θ0) / Imf4 as a function of [formula].

We find that the asymmetry is of the order of 10- 1 in units of Imf4. This information can be converted into a 95% confidence level (CL) limit on Imf4 that can be placed if an asymmetry is not seen, by demanding that in the limiting case, the difference in the number of forward and backward events is 1.96 times the statistical error in the total number of events:

[formula]

where L is the integrated luminosity. Writing

[formula]

eq.([\ref=95cl]) leads to the 95% CL limit on Imf4 of

[formula]

Table 1 shows the 95% CL limit that could be achieved on Imf4 with integrated luminosities of 10 fb- 1, 50 fb- 1 and 100 fb- 1 for different energies, and an angular cut of [formula].

We thus see that it is possible to achieve a sensitivity of 0.24 to 7.5×  10- 2 in Imf4 for an NLC operating at [formula] GeV with luminosity in the range 10 to 100 fb- 1. For somewhat higher [formula], the sensitivity is improved further, though not drastically. For very large [formula] ([formula] GeV), the sensitivity starts to decrease.

We conclude with a few remarks.

We have studied a CP-violating asymmetry which depends on the imaginary part of a single effective coupling, namely, f4. While our approach has been to purely phenomenological, where we do not assume any definite model, it would be worthwhile to give a little thought to possible scenarios which could give rise to non-negligible Imf4. In gauge models, such anomalous couplings are expected to arise only at the loop level, and therefore expected to be extremely small. Possible contributions to f4 have been investigated in a general scenario in [\cite=burgess]. While their investigation is for LEP 200 energies, and restricted to the dispersive contributions below new thresholds, we might extrapolate their reasoning to conclude that there could be large scalar or fermion-loop contributions at [formula] GeV provided there are new particle thresholds in that region. These contributions can arise in models with exotic fermions or extra Higgs with masses in the region of a few hundred GeV, which are not ruled by present experiments. Even then, the numerical value of Imf4 is still expected to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the limit we quote as feasible. If the signal we discuss is discovered, it would indeed signal very new physics. This situation perhaps calls for a search for more sensitive tests for studying CP-violating couplings like f4.

We have assumed ideal conditions, viz., 100% efficiency for energy and angle determination of Z. While a leptonic decay channel of Z can lead to an accurate determination of the energy and angle, there would be some loss of efficiency because of angular cuts in the forward and backward directions on the leptons. Effects of initial-state radiation and off-shell Z effects can also lead to some amount of deterioration in the sensitivity. These effects and the effects of cuts to remove the SM background need further study. However, we expect the quantitative conclusions to remain valid to a good deal of accuracy.

We have thus demonstrated the possibility of measuring separately (the imaginary part of) the CP-odd coupling f4 at NLC by means of a simple forward-backward asymmetry.
