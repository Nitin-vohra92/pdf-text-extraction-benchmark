There is a great current interest in the localization weakening effect due to the interaction of two electrons in one-dimensional (1D) disordered systems [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] [\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10]. Shepelyansky [\cite=1] mapped this problem onto a class of random banded matrices with strongly fluctuating diagonal elements, being the eigenenergies of the non-interacting problem, and independent Gaussian random off-diagonal matrix elements of zero average and typical strength [formula], lying in a band of width the one particle localization length ξ1 with U the strength of the interaction. Moreover, by the mapping to a superimposed banded random matrix ensemble (SBRM) a fraction of [formula] states with a considerable enhancement ξ  ~  U2ξ21 of the localization length along the center of mass coordinate is predicted due to coherent propagation of the electronic pair. It was also shown that the interaction has no effect for the majority of other states with the two particles localized in isolated spatial positions which do not allow overlapping. This conclusion was confirmed and extended to higher dimensions via Thouless block scaling picture by Imry [\cite=2]. The subsequent numerical studies [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] [\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10] verified the main qualitative results concerning the presence of Shepelyansky states, mostly by supressing single particle transport via efficient Green function or bag model methods which examine pair propagation [\cite=8]. The deviations from the predicted behavior of the two-particle localization length ξ found were usually attributed to the oversimplified statistical assumptions concerning the band random matrix model of the original Shepelyansky construction.

However, there is an ongoing debate whether coherent pair propagation actually exists for two interacting electrons in infinite disordered systems [\cite=11] [\cite=12], which began by a recent transfer matrix study where no propagation enhancement is found at E = 0 for an infinite chain [\cite=11]. Moreover, it was pointed out that the reduction to a SBRM relies on questionable assumptions regarding chaoticity of the non-interacting electron localized states within ξ1, so that the relevant matrix model could be probably different [\cite=13] [\cite=14]. Although the reported absence of propagation enhancement [\cite=11] can be critisized, since the transfer matrix method may not measure the actual pair localization length, it is correct that the fraction of the Shepelyansky states will eventually shrink to zero when the system size increases, although not affecting their physical significance. A different localization length enhancement for theses states, of the form ξ  ~  U2ξ1 + γ1 with a U-dependent exponent γ < 1, was also proposed on the basis of numerical data by a reduction mechanism to another appropriate random matrix model [\cite=13]. It must be mentioned that the Shepelyansky states are expected to exist as long as the interaction is not too large, since it is firmly established [\cite=10] [\cite=13] that in the strong interaction limit U  →    ∞   no coherent propagation enhancement is possible with these states decoupled from the main band with ξ  ≈  ξ1.

It is worthwhile to check the validity of the mapping to a SBRM which allowed most of the previous results concerning the Shepelyansky states to be derived. The fact that a mapping to SBRM neglects phase correlations of the one particle localized states was also emphasised for a few known examples in another recent study [\cite=14], where it lead to a non-justified propagation enhancement. In order to shed light on the appropriate random matrix description for the problem of two interacting electrons in a random potential we examine explicitly the structure of the two and three-electron Hamiltonian matrices by a direct numerical analysis. The corresponding Anderson-Hubbard Hamiltonian[\cite=15] [\cite=16] can be written as
