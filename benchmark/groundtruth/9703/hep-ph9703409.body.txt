Grand unification and heavy axion

in

In QCD, the effective θ-parameter   =  θ  +  Mquark breaks CP [\cite=Hooft] and is experimentally constrained to be unnaturally small, [formula] (for reviews see, e.g., ref. [\cite=Reviews]). An elegant solution to this strong CP problem is based on the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) symmetry [\cite=PQ] and predicts a light particle, axion. In view of constraints from experimental searches for the Weinberg--Wilczek [\cite=WW] axion, a widely accepted option is an extremely light invisible axion [\cite=invisible]. A potential problem with the latter comes from possible non-renormalizable terms in the low energy Lagrangian which may be due to very high (say, Planckian) scales and need not respect PQ symmetry [\cite=gravity]. Negligible for other purposes, these terms would introduce extra axion potential and ruin the Peccei--Quinn mechanism precisely because the QCD contribution into the axion potential is tiny. From this point of view it is more safe to have axion heavy enough.

In this paper we point out that heavy axions may appear in sufficiently complex grand unified theories containing extra gauge interactions (with unbroken gauge group) which become strong well above the accessible energies. The effective θ-parameters of QCD and these extra strong interactions may be equal to each other due to a symmtry built in a GUT. If there is one PQ symmetry relevant to both QCD and extra strong interactions, the Peccei--Quinn mechanism rotates away both of these θ-parameters, while axion obtains its mass predominantly from extra strong interactions and is therefore heavy (much heavier than Weinberg--Wilczek one).

Similar idea was put forward by Tye [\cite=Tye] (see also ref.[\cite=Krasnikov]) in the context of technicolor plus Higgs models with PQ symmetry. However, many (if not all) such models predict numerous pseudo-Goldstone bosons; some of these are charged and have masses well below 40 GeV, which is ruled out experimentally. This problem is not inherent in GUTs.

To be specific, let us consider a toy GUT. This model will not be realistic for several reasons, but we expect that it picks up generic features of possible heavy axions. The model is a non-supersymmetric GUT with the gauge group SU(5)  ×  SU(5), where the first SU(5) is meant to model real world and the second SU(5) is a mirror group. Let the fermionic and Higgs content be mirror symmetric. Ordinary (mirror) fermions are singlets under mirror (ordinary) SU(5) and form the usual [formula]- and 10-plets under ordinary (mirror) SU(5). There is one Higgs 24-plet and two Higgs 5-plets in each SU(5) sector which are singlets under partner SU(5). Let us require that at this stage each SU(5) sector has its own PQ symmetry that rotates the two Higgs 5-plets in the opposite ways,

[formula]

for ordinary Higgs 5-plets φ(1,2)5, and

[formula]

for mirror Higgs 5-plets Φ(1,2)5. To have just one PQ symmetry, let us introduce an SU(5)  ×  SU(5) singlet complex scalar field S of PQ charge 1 that interacts with both ordinary and mirror Higgs 5-plets,

[formula]

The self-interaction of S is required to be symmetric under the phase rotations of S, so the remaining PQ symmetry is ([\ref=4*]), ([\ref=4**]) with β  =  α and S  →  iαS. Let us assume for definiteness that S does not obtain vacuum expectation value, though this assumption is not crucial for further discussion.

Let us now require that at the (high) energy scales where both SU(5) groups are unbroken, hard (dimension 4) terms in the whole Lagrangian are mirror symmetric, while the soft terms are not. This implies, in particular, that θordinary  =  θmirror (the θ-terms are hard) and that the phases of Yukawa couplings are the same in ordinary and mirror sectors. This requirement also implies the equality of the couplings entering eq.([\ref=4+]), h' = h. Hence, without loss of generality one sets h to be real (the phase of h can be rotated away by the phase rotation of S). In one loop, the interaction ([\ref=4+]) introduces direct interaction between ordinary and mirror Higgs 5-plets,

[formula]

where [formula] and μ is the normalization scale. Note that λ is real and the interaction ([\ref=5+]) is still PQ symmetric.

Let us require that, just like ordinary SU(5), mirror SU(5) breaks down to SU(3)mc  ×  U(1)mEM, where mc and mEM refer to mirror color and mirror electromagntism, respectively. Since the soft terms of the mirror sector are different from those of ordinary sector, this breaking occurs at different energy scales. Consider the case when mirror SU(5) breaks down at much lower energy than the ordinary GUT scale. The coupling constant of SU(5) runs faster than that of SU(3), so the mirror coupling constant is larger than that of ordinary SU(3)c at the point where mirror SU(5) breaks down. Hence, SU(3)mc becomes strong at the scale Λmc which is larger than ordinary ΛQCD. Assuming

[formula]

we have the mirror world similar to the ordinary world, but scaled up in energy (and with vm  /  Λmc not necessarily of the same order as the ratio of the ordinary Higgs expectation value to QCD confinement scale, v / ΛQCD  ~  103).

By the mirror symmetry of the hard terms, the effective θ-parameters of ordinary and mirror sectors are equal to each other, at least at the tree level. By performing PQ rotation, one makes both of them equal to zero. By the mirror PQ mechanism, the axion field then takes zero vacuum expectation value, and both mirror and ordinary strong interactions conserve CP. In other words, at non-zero mirror effective θ-parameter, mirror, the phase of the vacuum expectation value of [formula] is proportional to mirror by PQ mechanism; the interaction ([\ref=5+]) aligns the phase of [formula] to the same value, so the effective ordinary θ-parameter, after PQ rotation, becomes equal to ordinary  -  mirror  =  0, at least at the tree level .

The axion obtains its mass predominantly due to mirror strong interactions. It is, in fact, a mirror Weinberg--Wilczek axion. The expression for the mass is a scaled up version of the Weinberg formula. Recalling that the mass of the Weinberg--Wilczek axion scales as [formula] we estimate the axion mass in our model as

[formula]

This may certainly be much larger that mWW.

To get an idea of numbers, let us point out that non-supersymmetric SU(5) becomes strong at about 105 GeV. Hence, [formula] GeV. Under the assumption ([\ref=6*]) and using mWW  ~  100 KeV, we have

[formula]

Let us stress that by varying Λmc and vm one can easily get the axion much lighter than 1 TeV. Say, at Λmc  ~  3 TeV and vm  ~  10 TeV one has Ma  ~  20 GeV.

The axion interactions with ordinary matter come from the term ([\ref=5+]). At energies below vm we have

[formula]

where c1 and c2 are constants of order 1, and a(x) is the axion field. The first term here produces the off-diagonal mass term for the ordinary Higgs fields that breaks the low energy PQ symmetry ([\ref=4*]) explicitly and softly. The corresponding mass parameter, [formula] should be of order 100 GeV to avoid fine tuning in the ordinary electroweak Higgs sector. The second term in eq.([\ref=8*]), being inserted into eq.([\ref=5+]), induces mixing between axion and axial Higgs boson A0 which is of order m212v / vm. Hence, one expects the mixing angle

[formula]

With vm  ~  104 - 105 GeV this angle is in the range 10- 2 - 10- 4, but this estimate is again strongly parameter-dependent, and the mixing may be somewhat higher.

Thus, in our toy model the axion is a relatively light remnant of extra strong interactions operating at very short distances. The axion mass may be well within accessible range of energies; its interactions with ordinary matter come from mixing with axial Higgs boson A0, and the mixing angle may not be negligibly small. The scalar potential of the ordinary Higgs fields exhibits softly broken PQ symmetry. We expect that these features are generic to the class of grand unified theories where the strong CP problem is solved in a way discussed in this paper.
