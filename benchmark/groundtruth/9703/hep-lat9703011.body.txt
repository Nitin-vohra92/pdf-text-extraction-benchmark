The "no-go" theorem of Nielsen and Ninomiya has been the most tenacious obstacle against the construction of a chiral gauge theory with reasonable low energy spectrum, couplings and anomaly. In this paper we construct a model which supplements the usual (bilinear in the Fermi fields) lagrangian with quadrilinear fermionic terms. We show that in a certain region of the parameter space the difficulties of the "no-go" theorem may be overcome, and a "renormalized" perturbative strategy can be carried out, akin to the one followed in the Rome Approach (RA), whose counterterms are forced to be gauge invariant.

1. The problem of defining a quantum chiral gauge field theory on a lattice lies at the roots of the Standard Model (SM). For even if space-time, the physical arena of the SM, is a continuum (as modeled in the generally accepted SM, which we shall call Continuum Standard Model (CSM)) well beyond the Planck length (ap≃10- 33 cm), the very process of "renormalizing" the theory requires its definition on a space-time, like a discrete lattice, where the energy-momentum spectrum of the quantum fluctuations is bounded from above. When this can be done, i.e. when we can define our chiral gauge theory on a lattice with arbitrarily small lattice constant a, the continuum limit is simply defined by the limit a  →  0.

It seems to us that this is the (essentially unique) way to give any sense to a Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and this for two reasons: one physical, the other mathematical. From the standpoint of physics the assumption of a mathematical continuum as the space-time basis of a generic QFT totally neglects the possible effects of the physics of Quantum Gravity in determining (according to the seminal ideas of Bernhard Riemann) the "fine-structure" of the (geometry of the) set of physical events. As for mathematics itself a continuum QFT contains actual infinities, a nightmare sternly but pointlessy denounced by Dirac, which can be possibly exorcized through a limiting procedure upon theories defined on lattices whose constants decrease to zero.

It is for the reasons just discussed that a most simple and general theorem [\cite=nn], found by H.B.Nielsen and M.Ninomiya at the beginning of the Eighties, appears as a most disappointing obstacle [\cite=p] to giving a definite quantum field theoretical sense to the Standard Model itself, whose electroweak sector comprises precisely a quantum chiral gauge field theory. Prompted by the clear physical indication coming from the stunning phenomenological successes of the SM, L.Maiani and collaborators in Rome have elaborated a most reasonable philosophy to get around the unfavourable consequences of Nielsen and Ninomiya's "no-go theorem", without actually explicitly constructing a lattice QFT that evades the "no-go theorem", and at the same time yields in the continuum limit (a  →  0) the correct phenomenology. The analysis at one-loop level carried out by this group [\cite=rome] confirms the soundness of their point of view. However it is clear that a positive answer to the question whether the favourable signs now available will turn the Rome Approach (as it has been called, RA) into a consistent fool-proof strategy to calculate the chiral gauge theory in the continuum limit, can be given if we are able to explicitly construct a consistent lattice chiral gauge theory whose continuum limit (a  →  0) is just the "target theory" of the RA.

It is worthwhile recalling that in the last few years we have tried to develop a research program centered on the formulation of the SM on a Planck lattice, a lattice whose constant a is just the Planck length ap. The main physics motivation of our program is the expectation [\cite=wheeler] that the violent quantum fluctuations of Quantum Gravity (QG) at the Planck scale do give rise to a discrete space-time structure, that can be usefully modeled by a 4-dimensional lattice, we have christened such attempt the Planck Lattice Standard Model (PLSM). A crucial aspect of the PLSM is the basic chiral nature of the electroweak sector, thus a basic prerequisite for its success is our ability to find an explicit formulation of a chiral gauge theory that

removes the "doubling" of the Weyl fermions and retains the correct anomaly;

maintains in the low-energy spectrum the basic chiral coupling to the gauge field;

realizes a "renormalized" perturbative strategy akin to the one known as the Rome Approach without gauge-variant counterterms and pushing the gauge bosons' masses to the Planck mass, mp.

In this paper we shall introduce an explicit chiral lattice QFT model and show that in a certain region of the relevant parameter space, the "physical wedge", it satisfies the above three requirements. However, we should like to point out that we do not make any attempt to formulate a fully relativistic PLSM of quark and lepton families in terms of our chiral model, thus we can keep its structure as simple as possible.

The model we shall analyse below is the simplest SU(2) chiral gauge theory, which in order to avoid the sanctions of the "no-go theorem" will be supplemented with quadrilinear Fermi interactions terms[\cite=ep][\cite=xue], which we shall call the Nambu-Jona Lasinio (NJL) terms. Thus the fermionic part of the action on the lattice (of lattice constant a) is written as (repeated indices are summed over)

[formula]

where ψiL(n) (i = 1,2) is the SU(2)L gauged doublet, ψlR(n) (l = 1,2) is a doublet, invariant under the transformations of SU(2)L; both ψiL and ψlR are two-component Weyl fermions. In the second NJL-term

[formula]

in the continuum limit this term is a dimension-10 operator which is relevant only for "doublers", i.e. for those field modes whose momenta

[formula]

ΠA being one of the fifteen Brillouin momenta and [formula]. Note that in addition to the SU(2)L chiral gauge invariance, and the global SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R symmetry, the fermion action ([\ref=action]) possesses when g1 = 0 an exact ψR-shift symmetry [\cite=gp]:

[formula]

2. Our goal now is to seek a possible region of the (g1,g2,g)-space (g is the SU(2) gauge coupling constant) where there "lives" a theory that obeys the requirements 1. - 3. above. To start with we shall assume that the gauge coupling is a good perturbative coupling, thus for the time being we shall take g  →  0.

In the (g1,g2)-plane, in the weak coupling limit g1,g2  ≪  1, as indicated in fig.1, the action ([\ref=action]) defines a SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R chiral continuum theory with a "doubled" fermion spectrum, a theory that violates requirement 1.. On increasing g1, while keeping g2 in the perturbative region g2  ≪  1, following the analysis and the discussion of Eichten and Preskill (EP) [\cite=ep], we shall hit a critical value gc1, above which the theory undergoes a phase transition. Using a strong coupling expansion in g1 (g1  >  gc1) we can show that the fields ψiL and ψlR appearing in ([\ref=action]) pair up with the composite Weyl fermions:

[formula]

respectively to build two massive Dirac fermions ψln, neutral with respect to the gauge transformations of SU(2)L, and ψic , carrying a SU(2)L charge. Their propagators in the strong coupling limit are given by

[formula]

[formula]

where the chiral invariant mass is given,

[formula]

These propagator show that in this region not only the "doublers" have acquired a [formula] mass but also the "normal" modes (Πa = 0). And this is clearly not acceptable.

Let us now discuss the phase structure of the theory in the neighbourhood of the critical value gc1 (while keeping g2 very small). Such critical value is determined [\cite=gpr] by the propagators of the 8 composite scalars

[formula]

corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of the complex fields lR  ·  ψiL. In the strong coupling limit one easily obtains

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] are external momenta. It is only when the composites ([\ref=ail]) become bound states, i.e. when μ2 > 0, that one obtains what we might call the EP-phenomenon, leading to the appearance of the chiral symmetric phase (that we call EP-phase) where Dirac fermions propagate according to ([\ref=sn]) and ([\ref=sc]). The critical value gc1 can be determined by setting μ2 = 0 Thus, due to the momentum dependence (through the g2-term) of μ2, for g2  ≠  0 we shall have different critical coupling constants gc1 for different "doublers", in particular in the strong coupling limit for the "normal" mode one has gc1normal = 0.5. Thus in the (g1,g2)-plane from the point (gc1normal,0) there start (See Fig.1) different critical lines, one for each ΠA, separating the symmetric EP-phase from another phase, that Eichten and Preskill expected to be a weak coupling symmetric phase. Thus, one can define continuum chiral gauge theories on one of these critical lines where all doublers are decoupled, chiral fermions remain and gauge symmetry is not broken. We call this expectation as the EP scenario. However, as pointed out by ref.[\cite=gpr], this EP scenario fails owing to the fact that critical lines gc1(gc2) do not separate two symmetric phases and there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase, which we shall call the NJL-phase, in between the two symmetric phases. This can be quickly figured out by looking at what one gets μ2 > 0 (symmetric phase), μ2 = 0 (critical lines) and μ2 < 0 (broken phase).

In order to check this latter statement, let us return to the weak coupling g1,g2 limit. Based on the analysis of the large-Nf (Nf is the multiplicity associated with an extra fermionic index, e.g. Ncolor) weak coupling expansion, we argue that the NJL-terms in the action ([\ref=action]) induce a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking [\cite=njl]. Indeed in the new vacuum the Weyl fields ψiL and ψiR pair up to become massive Dirac fields that violate SU(2)-chiral symmetry, a fact that can be ascertained in the following way. The inverse propagator of this massive Dirac fermion can be written as

[formula]

where the fermion self-energy function, in the Nf  →    ∞   limit, obeys the "gap-equation" (Σil(p) = δilΣ(p)):

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula]. Using the parametrization[\cite=gpr]

[formula]

where ρ depends on 1,2 only, we can solve the gap-equation ([\ref=se]) in a straightforward manner. For [formula], one gets

[formula]

where

[formula]

For g1 = 0 Eq.([\ref=roa]) implies:

[formula]

This means that on the line g1 = 0 the "normal" modes (ΠA = 0) remain massless, while all the "doublers" acquire a mass [formula], thus violating chiral invariance through the g2 coupling alone.

As for the function fμL(p) (fμR(p)) in Eq.([\ref=sb]), the ψR-shift symmetry for g1  →  0 allows us to derive for fμR(p) the form

[formula]

while for fμL(p) in the large Nf-limit one obtains:

[formula]

with the wave-function renormalization Z2(p = p̃  +  Π) = const. The details of the calculation will be presented elsewhere. Thus the massive Dirac inverse propagator can be written for both members of the SU(2) doublet

[formula]

showing that the SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(2), giving rise to three Goldstone bosons and one massive [formula] Higgs mode, as discussed in Ref.[\cite=xue].

For v  →  0 Eq ([\ref=roa]) yields a critical line (c1,c2) separating the NJL-phase from the weak coupling symmetric phase, which goes from (0.4,0) to (0,0.006) as indicated in Fig.1. Thus the NJL-phase stands between the chiral symmetric doubled weak coupling phase and the chiral symmetric EP-phase. This fact, that according to our analysis holds even for Nf = 1, shows that the EP-scenario for getting around the no-go theorem, unfortunately cannot be realized. Indeed, such scenario contemplates the contiguity of the EP and the symmetric weak phase, so that there would exist a chiral line (See Fig.1) where the theory is chirally symmetric and all the unwanted doublers get a mass [formula]. Our analysis shows instead that the EP-phase is contiguous to the NJL-phase, that we have just described and agrees with analysis of ref.[\cite=gpr].

Unfortunately also the NJL-phase is physically not entirely acceptable, for even when g1 = 0 the SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R chiral symmetry is violated by a hard breaking Wilson term [\cite=wilson] (See eq. (14)), corresponding to a dimension 5-operator. As a consequence, in the well known phenomenon that mixes the gauge bosons and the Goldstone modes one expects the gauge bosons to acquire a mass [formula], contrary to physics expectations.

3. In our investigation we are finally left with another strong coupling region (g1  ≪  1,g2  ≫  1) (See Fig.1) where the ψR-shift symmetry is exact. This region can be treated exactly as the one dealt with above. We find that the vacuum of the theory retains the SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R symmetry, and its excitation spectrum contains both chiral invariant (ψln) and chiral (ψic) massive Dirac fermions, whose propagators in the strong coupling limit g2  ≫  1 can be determined to be of the same form as eqs.([\ref=sn],[\ref=sc]). The chiral invariant mass, instead of eq.([\ref=m1]), this time is given by:

[formula]

As for the charged fermion field ψic, even when g1  ≪  0 and g2  ≫  0, the low energy spectrum still comprises the massive Dirac mode built by the "normal" modes of ψiL and the composite (kR  ·  ψiL)ψkR, a situation that is phenomenologically undesirable. One can solve this problem if in the (g1,g2)-plane there existed a wedge where only the unwanted doublers are in the EP-phase, while the "normal" modes would still be massless (does not undergo the NJL spontaneous symmetry breaking) and live upon a chirally symmetric vacuum. In order to see whether such circumstance really occurs, let us proceed as above. We consider again the scalars Ail1,2 (See Eq.([\ref=ail])) and their propagators, whose mass μ2 this time is not given (approximately) by ([\ref=mu]), but by:

[formula]

The critical lines for different doublers acquiring chiral invariant masses are determined, as above, by the condition μ2 = 0; thus the first "threshold" (See Fig.1) is encountered when g1 = 0 at g2 = 0.002, for the doubler:

[formula]

while the last threshold appears for g2 = 0.03, corresponding to the four doublers with

[formula]

Thus in the strong coupling approximation for g2 > 0.03 all excitations but the "normal" modes [formula], i.e. all doublers, acquire chiral-invariant [formula] masses ([\ref=sn],[\ref=sc],[\ref=emme]), while the latter modes remain massless, on a chirally invariant vacuum, so long as g1 = 0.

In order to check latter statement that normal mode remains massless, we go back to eq.([\ref=hope]) that shows normal mode is massless when the coupling g1 = 0, even for very large value of the coupling g2. This is actually resulted by the exact shift-symmetry ([\ref=shift]) when the coupling g1 = 0. Thus, the failure of the EP-scenario, due to very existence of the NJL broken phase in between two symmetric phases discussed in our previous section and ref.[\cite=gpr] can be cured when g1 = 0, where normal modes always remain in the chirally symmetric phase and we can send g2  →    ∞   to guarantee that all the doublers are chirally invariantly decoupled. Note that such an important feature is absent, when g1 = 0, in the original EP's model[\cite=ep].

To summarize the above discussion, let us make a journey in the (g1,g2)-plane taking off from the origin, and identify the different phases of the theory described by the lattice action ([\ref=action]). We walk first in the weak coupling symmetric phase, populated by massless, doubled fermions: a strange, alien world. Diffusing away from the origin we hit a line, the NJL-line, that pushes the doublers to the cut-off, i.e. gives them a chirally variant [formula] mass, but unfortunately does so also to the chiral gauge bosons due to the hard (dimension-5) Wilson term, that possesses now a non-trivial expectation value in the new NJL-vacuum. Thus, again, we are in a world completely different from our own. Continuing to move out, always keeping g1 < 0.5, we hit several other critical lines where different doublers acquire a chirally invariant [formula] mass, up to the last line where the four doublers physical with |pμ| = π get their chiral invariant [formula] masses ([\ref=sn],[\ref=sc],[\ref=emme]). Past that line and go down onto g1 = 0, we are in the sought "physical wedge" (See Fig. 1): here the low energy spectrum is undoubled, it only contains "normal" modes and, most importantly, the original chiral SU(2)L-gauge symmetry for |pμ|  ≪  1 is exact when g1 = 0. More precisely, in this wedge the "normal" mode of ψiL, due to the vanishing of Σ(0) ([\ref=hope]), interacts in a completely chiral invariant way. From Eq.([\ref=smu]) we can write the propagators of such massless modes as:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where 2 is the wave-function renormalization for p = p̃ and g1 = 0. Thus we see that the scenario envisaged by Eichten and Preskill can be finally realized, but only in the physical wedge g1  →  0, g2 > 0.03. We should also stress at this point that, even though our arguments are based on various kinds of approximations, strong coupling and large Nf, there are absolutely no reasons to expect that more accurate calculations will change qualitatively the whole picture.

This shows that there exists a well defined, concrete way to get around the "no-go theorem" of Nielsen and Ninomiya that has so far barred the road to viable chiral gauge theories. The way around the "no-go theorem" requires the extension of the simple Wilson gauge lagrangian through the addition of two quadrilinear fermionic interactions terms (See Eq.(1)), which in a particular physical wedge of the (g1,g2)-plane give rise to a ground state where the unwanted doublers acquire a large chiral invariant [formula] mass by the EP mechanism, while the "normal" (low momenta) fermionic modes do not get their masses through a Nambu-Jona Lasinio spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, thus keeping the low-momentum interaction chirally invariant. This provides a physical arena to realize the scenario of the RA. The theory defined by the action Eq.([\ref=action]) upon the vacuum of the "physical wedge" has all the features of the target theory of the RA. As a consequence it can be looked at as a concrete justification of the feasibility of the perturbative strategy envisaged in the RA. However, instead of utilizing in the "renormalized" perturbation theory the gauge non-invariant Wilson propagator to remove doublers and the gauge variant counterterms to enforce the chiral gauge symmetries, one has now in the "physical wedge" an undoubled low-energy effective theory with the gauge invariant propagators ([\ref=sn]), ([\ref=sc]) for doublers and ([\ref=sldp]), ([\ref=splk]) for normal modes respectively, thus allowing gauge-invariant counterterms only, as expected in gauge invariant Quantum Field Theories like QCD and QED.
