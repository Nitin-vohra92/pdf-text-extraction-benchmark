Note on the paper of Fu and Wong on strictly pseudoconvex domains with Kähler-Einstein Bergman metrics

In this brief note we use our uniformization result from [\cite=NS1] [\cite=NS2] to extend the work of Fu and Wong [\cite=FW] on the relationship between two long-standing conjectures about the behaviour of the Bergman metric of a strictly pseudoconvex domain in [formula], n  ≥  2.

1. Let [formula] be an arbitrary bounded domain. The Bergman kernel function of D can be defined by the formula

[formula]

where [formula] is any orthonormal basis of the space L2O(D) of square-integrable holomorphic functions in D.

It is a standard result that the function log KD(z) is strictly plurisubharmonic and the positive (1,1)-form

[formula]

is invariant with respect to biholomorphic mappings between bounded domains. The Bergman metric on D is the Kähler metric associated with this Kähler form.

2. Fefferman [\cite=Fe] (see also [\cite=BdMS]) established the following deep result on the boundary behaviour of the kernel function of a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain D. Let [formula] be a defining function for D. Then there is a decomposition

[formula]

where the functions [formula], and φ  ≠  0 everywhere on ∂D. Note that the latter property implies that the Bergman metric of a strictly pseudoconvex domain is complete.

Although the kernel function is defined globally, its asymptotic behaviour as z  →  z0∈∂D depends only on the local CR geometry of the boundary at the point z0 (see [\cite=Fe]). For instance, the kernel function of the unit ball [formula] can be explicitly decomposed as

[formula]

with identically vanishing logarithmic term. Thus the coefficient ψ in the logarithmic term of ([\ref=Feff]) vanishes to infinite order at the boundary for any strictly pseudoconvex domain whose boundary is spherical (i. e., locally CR diffeomorphic to the unit sphere [formula]).

The Ramadanov conjecture [\cite=Ra] asserts that, conversely, the vanishing condition ψ = O(ρ∞) implies that the boundary of D is spherical. This conjecture has been proved for domains in [formula] by Graham and Burns [\cite=Grm] and Boutet de Monvel [\cite=BdM].

3. A classical problem, proposed in different forms by Bergman, Hua, and Yau, asks to describe the domain in terms of the differential-geometric properties of its Bergman metric. For example, a well-known theorem of Lu Qi-Keng [\cite=Lu] states that a bounded domain with complete Bergman metric of constant holomorphic sectional curvature is biholomorphic to the ball.

The Cheng conjecture [\cite=Che] asserts that the hypotheses of Lu's theorem can be weakened for a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain. Namely, such a domain has to be biholomorphic to the ball if and only if its Bergman metric is Kähler-Einstein.

The Cheng conjecture in [formula] follows from the Ramadanov conjecture in [formula].

Since the Ramadanov conjecture is known to be true in dimension 2, we obtain the following result.

The Bergman metric of a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain [formula] is Kähler-Einstein if and only if this domain is biholomorphic to the ball.

Fu and Wong [\cite=FW] proved these results for simply connected domains using a weaker uniformization result of Chern and Ji [\cite=cj] and stated the general case as an open question.

Suppose that the Bergman metric of a strictly pseudoconvex domain D is Kähler-Einstein. Fu and Wong [\cite=FW] computed (rather ingeniously) that in this case the logarithmic coefficient ψ in the decomposition ([\ref=Feff]) vanishes to infinite order at ∂D. Assuming the Ramadanov conjecture, we conclude that the boundary of D is spherical. Hence, by the uniformization theorem (see [\cite=NS1] and [\cite=NS2]) the domain D is covered by the unit ball.

Since D is the quotient of the ball by the group of holomorphic deck transformations, there is a natural complete metric of constant holomorphic sectional curvature on D obtained by taking the quotient of the standard invariant metric on the ball. According to Cheng and Yau [\cite=CY], the complete Kähler-Einstein metric on D is unique up to a constant factor. Hence, the Bergman metric of D is proportional to the quotient metric and so has constant holomorphic sectional curvature. It follows that D is biholomorphic to the ball by Lu's theorem [\cite=Lu].
