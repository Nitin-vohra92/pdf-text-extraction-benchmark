An Asymmetry in the Maxwell Equations

[formula]

The Faraday-Lenz and Maxwell-Ampere Laws

The third Maxwell equation is

[formula]

This is the Faraday-Lenz law, which can be regarded as describing an electric field that is induced along a conducting coil by a changing magnetic flux that is symmetrically enclosed by that coil. Due to the negative sign on the right side of Equation 1.1, the direction of the curl of the electric field is reversed. The fourth Maxwell equation is

[formula]

where [formula] represents a magnetic field and where the left side of the equation is the integral of the dot product [formula] around a closed loop. This is the Maxwell-Ampere law, which describes the right-handed curl of a magnetic field about the linearly directed electric current μ0ienc, and about the displacement current [formula] (a virtual current that occurs in the absence of a conductor and generates a magnetic field). The constants of proportionality μ0 and ε0 are the familiar permeability and permittivity constants. The term [formula], which describes Maxwell's virtual or displacement current was introduced to satisfy symmetry, but was experimentally confirmed. [formula]

A New Term Dictated by Symmetry

It is now argued that the above described equations collectively involve an asymmetry that is due to the absence of a term on the left side of the Faraday-Lenz law (1.1). This term would describe a loop of displacement current about a linear increment [formula] of magnetic flux in the absence of a conducting coil. According to conventional theory, the Faraday-Lenz law would be degenerate in the absence of a conducting coil, but symmetry and the existence of Maxwell's displacement current combine to argue that a loop, or series of loops of virtual current (a loop or series of loops of displacement current) does symmetrically enclose a linear increment of magnetic flux in the absence of a conducting coil. Specifically such considerations argue for the addition of a term

[formula]

to the left side of the Faraday-Lenz law (Equation 1.1). As in the introduction of the term

[formula]

to the right side of the Maxwell-Ampere law, the addition of the term (2.1) to the left side of the Faraday-Lenz law is to satisfy symmetry; but as in the former case, the addition of the term (2.1) predicts a phenomenon that can be experimentally confirmed. [formula]

Physical Prediction of the Proposed Term

In paramagnetic materials such as water, each molecule is characterized by a net permanent magnetic dipole moment. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic dipole moments of the individual molecules align with the external field. In this context let us consider the molecules of a river that is flowing from north to south. In this context the magnetic dipole moments of the individual molecules align with the earth's magnetic field, so that the paramagnetic sample of N molecules that is represented by the river produces a magnetic dipole moment of magnitude Nμ (where μ represents the magnetic dipole moment of an individual molecule). Thus the north to south flow of the river produces an effect that is equivalent to the motion of a large bar magnetic, which is moving, north pole leading, toward the south. If the proposed term (2.1), that (in the absence of a conducting coil) describes a loop of displacement current about the time rate of change of an actual magnetic flux, is correct, then the flow of the river, which generates an increment [formula] of magnetic flux, should produce a loop of displacement current that is orthogonal to the flow of the river; i.e. the flow of the river should produce a curl of a virtual electric field, [formula], that is anti-parallel to the flow of the river. In this context let us consider a linear object consisting of a ferromagnetic material and therefore associating with a weak magnetic field. If this ferromagnetic object is prepared by exposure to the magnetic field of the earth (so that the magnetic field that is generated by the ferromagnetic material is aligned with the magnetic field of the earth), and if this object is then exposed to the area above the north-south flow of a river and oriented so that it lies in a plane that is parallel to that of the flowing river, then this linear object of ferromagnetic material should (if the fulcrum is appropriately placed) experience a torque that tends to anti-align the object with the north to south flow of the river. This prediction was recently confirmed by D. Couillard.

In the proposed context, the complete list of Maxwell's equations is:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the proposed modification is described by the second term on the left side of the Faraday-Lenz law (Equation 3.3). Again this term describes a loop of displacement current in the absence of a conducting coil, which is generated by a linear increment of magnetic flux [formula].
