Triangular mass matrices for quarks and leptons

We have not only an information from the experiment about quark masses and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) [\cite=CKM] mixing matrix for quarks [\cite=pdg] but now (after recent neutrino oscillation experiments [\cite=osc]) one also knows two mass square differences for neutrinos and with less precision Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) [\cite=MNS] mixing matrix for leptons [\cite=val] [\cite=VMNS]. Both mixing matrices (CKM and MNS) are products of matrices for left handed components for type u and type d quarks and for charged leptons and neutrinos. Knowing these matrices from experiment we do not know what is the connection between left and right handed components of the flavor states and states with definite mass for up, down quarks, neutrinos and charged leptons. It was pointed out that this creates a problem when looking for patterns of masses and symmetries in neutrino and quark sectors [\cite=fer] [\cite=king]. On the other hand if one knew from the lagrangian, after spontaneous symmetry breaking, mass matrices (they seem to be basic quantities) for quarks and leptons one could find by decomposition in two unitary matrices and diagonal matrix all the interesting mixing matrices. Then one is able to calculate CKM and MNS mixing matrices.

The aim of our paper is, treating neutrinos as Dirac particles, to give the explicit example of possible mass matrices for u, d, ν and l- giving mixing for left handed and right handed components between states with definite flavor and definite mass. We will assume that the mass matrices for quarks and leptons gotten from standard model after spontaneous symmetry breaking are in form of triangular matrices. With additional assumptions discussed later we determine them using available experimental information on quark and lepton masses and CKM and MNS mixing matrices. We consider at the begining case without CP violation and then include this effect in the quark sector.

Let us introduce the notation for quarks. The SU(3) * SU(2) * U(1) gauge invariant Yukawa interactions for quarks are given by

[formula]

where Qi denote the SU(2) doublets of left-handed quarks and uR, dR are the right-handed up and down-type quarks respectively. The Yukawa couplings Yu and Yd are [formula] matrices (i,j are the generation indices) and H is the SU(2) doublet Higgs field. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, these Yukawa interactions lead to the following quark mass terms

[formula]

where v is vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the Higgs field H.

These mass matrices Mu and Md can be diagonalized using two unitary matrices U and V

[formula]

The diagonal matrix elements (of MDu and MDd) correspond to the experimentally observed mass eigenvalues. The matrices U and V describe mixing between states with definite flavor u, d and with definite mass u', d' for left handed and right handed components

[formula]

The generation mixing in the charged weak current after expressing in terms of fields with definite mass is described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix which consists of two unitary matrices

[formula]

In the similar way, assuming that neutrinos are traditional Dirac particles, we have mixing for the charged weak current in the lepton sector described by Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) matrix

[formula]

with the relations for neutrino mass Mν and charged leptons Ml

[formula]

As before diagonal matrix elements of MDν and MDl correspond to the experimentally observed mass eigenvalues.

The present experimental values of the moduli of the quark and leptonic mixing matrices are for example given by [\cite=pdg]

[formula]

and [\cite=VMNS] (similar results given also by [\cite=val])

[formula]

In some sense matrices Mu, Md, Mν and Ml are basic quantities because they appear in lagrangian after symmetry breaking. If we knew the numerical values of their matrix elements we could immediately write the decomposition in terms of unitary (ortogonal if there is no CP violation) matrices as in eqs.(3), (4), (8) and (9) and then we could calculate VCKM and VMNS.

Let us start with some intuitive argument for considering triangular matrices. One can expect that because the ratios of masses for u-type quarks are bigger then for d-type quarks the mixing for u type quarks is smaller then for d type, in other words, that the Uu matrix is closer to identity matrix then Ud. That means in this case that Ud  ≈  VCKM. If we also assume that Vd  ≈  I (i.e. Vd is not very different from unity matrix) in fact we look in this way for asymmetrical decomposition for Md and we will get in this crude approximation from eq.(3) that Md  ≈  VCKMMDd. Substituting experimental values we will get that Md is very close to triangular matrix with matrix elements above main diagonal (with very small compared with the other matrix elements terms below main diagonal). It seems that in this case triangular matrices could be a good starting point to describe quark mass matrices. On the other hand we would like to treat quarks and leptons in the unified way. We assume that triangular matrices describe mass matrices not only for quarks but also for neutrinos and charged leptons. In this way we have 3 zero elements in the mass matrix, so in some sense we follow the papers in which one postulates several zeros in the mass matrix [\cite=par]. However, we do that in the universal way for quarks and leptons. The advantage is that lower or upper triangular matrices with hierarchical diagonal elements can give very asymmetric decomposition namely that mixing in U and V matrices is very different. When we assume matrices in triangular form which describe mass matrices of quarks and leptons we have lower and upper triangular matrices at our disposal. The second assumption is that mass matrices for the members of weak isospin doublets have different triangular form. That means that when for example d quark mass matrix is upper triangular matrix (it has non-zero matrix elements above main diagonal) than u quark mass matrix is lower triangular matrix (non-zero matrix elements below main diagonal and zero in the upper part). This assumption is connected with the fact that to produce mass of d and u (lower and upper weak isodoublet components) with the Higgs mechanism we have coupling with Higgs doublet or its hermitian conjugate. The third assumption is connected with the question how to take into account, treating mass matrices as the basic objects, that the right handed components are non active in weak interactions. The masses of particles in the weak isomultiplets are very different. We make an assumption that V matrices responsible for the mixing of right handed components in the same weak isodoublet are equal. That of course gives a very strong limitation on the possible mass matrices. With these three assumptions we are able to calculate mass matrices. Let us start with quarks. Instead to solve eq.(3) and (4) for quarks we will numerically minimalize the function

[formula]

There are 6 free parameters (3 diagonal and 3 non-diagonal) of upper triangular mass matrix Md and 6 parameters of lower triangular mass matrix Mu. The values mexpdi = (md,ms,mb), mexpui = (mu,mc,mt) and corresponding errors Δmexpdi, Δmexpui are taken from the Particle Data Group [\cite=pdg]. When we take VexpCKM from eq.(10) we would not have in calculations unitarity of VexpCKM with enough precision and that would result in minimal value of χ2, so we will take elements of VexpCKM and later VexpMNS expressed in terms of angles [\cite=ohl] to have unitarity satisfied to high degree and then use calculated in this way matrix elements. For the elements of mixing matrices V we take the artificial error 0.01.

The minimalization of χ2 gives the following results (element of mass matrices in MeV)

We see that diagonal matrix elements in mass matrices are very close to the "experimental" quark masses for u and d type quarks. Mixing in Vd is much smaller then in Ud and for u quark mixing in Uu is smaller then in Vu. The non-diagonal matrix elements in mass matrices Mu and Md are comparable what is a little bit surprising. With our assumptions we have got the solution for u and d-type quarks in which Uu is with high accuracy equal to identity matrix. The VCKM matrix calculated from eq.(6) is identical to Ud obtained in eq.(14).

We will repeat the calculations for neutrinos and charged leptons. We do not know the neutrino masses so it is not possible to solve eqs.(8) and (9). To get approximate solutions of eqs.(8) and (9) we will proceed as before and minimalize suitably modified χ2 function. In the first two terms in eq.(12) quark mixing matrices are substituted by lepton mixing matrices, VCKM by VMNS and so on. In the expression for χ2 given in eq.(12) instead of the third term that corresponds to diagonal d quark masses we will take

[formula]

Instead of the forth term in eq.(12) for u quark we take the corresponding term for charged leptons. The experimental values (Δm221)exp, (Δm231)exp and corresponding errors are taken from the fit in [\cite=VMNS]. Neutrino masses are measured in eV while all other masses in MeV. In the case of neutrinos equations corresponding to eqs.(13) to (20) are

We get that (non-diagonal) elements in mixing matrix Uν are bigger then in Vν and in Ul are smaller then in Vl. Ul is not very different from the unit matrix. For the VMNS mixing matrix calculated according to eq.(7) we get:

[formula]

The differences between VMNS and Uν matrix elements are smaller then experimental errors for matrix elements of VMNS. Non-diagonal matrix elements in mass matrix for charged leptons are comparable with those for u and d quarks. This is not a case for neutrino mass matrix. Matrix elements in Vν and in Vl are not small and comparable with Cabibbo mixing in d-type quarks. This result coming from the fit and being a consequence of our third assumption is very promising when we think about some ratios of charged lepton masses as being comparable in magnitude to the ratios of down quark masses. In the neutrino mass matrix non-diagonal matrix elements are comparable with the diagonal ones what produces strong mixing in Uν and relatively strong in Vν. Diagonal matrix elements in neutrino mass matrix eq.(22) are different from the diagonal masses in the matrix MDν eq.(24) because of strong mixing. According to eq.(24) we get:

[formula]

These values of neutrino masses come out from the fit. We get some hierarchy in neutrino mases but not comparable with what we have for quarks and charged leptons. Specially interesting is the first mass eigenvalue because it sets a scale. Its mass is about 1/4 of the mass of the second neutrino.The values of m2ν and m3ν are close to what one would expect from mass squared differences with small first neutrino mass. The question is what is the error for m1ν in the fit. When we fix m1ν and make fit for other quantities we get minimal χ2 smaller then one for 0.002  ≤  m1ν  ≤  0.005. For much smaller values of m1ν we also get χ2min  ≤  1 so we do not have strong limitations for m1ν. It seems that except of neutrino when mixing in mass matrix is very strong and the scale of masses is completely different the non-diagonal matrix elements in mass matrices of u and d type quarks and charged leptons are comparable (not very different in magnitude) in spite of the differences in ratios of masses of quarks and charged leptons. Could it be a hint in understanding the structure of masses of quarks and leptons?

Till now all the mixing matrices were real (orthogonal). There is no problem with repeating the calculation taking into account CP violation. In this case we simply have additional imaginary parts in VCKM matrix and unitary instead orthogonal mixing matrices. When we repeat the calculation as before for u and d type quarks solving eqs.(3) and (4) by minimizing χ2 function corresponding to that given in eq.(12) and taking into account that we have complex quantities we get:

Eqs.(32) to (39) should be compared with those given in eqs.(13-20). We see that there is no big change except of additional imaginary parts. There is no problem with repeating this type of calculation for neutrinos and charged leptons taking into account CP violation but we do not have enough information about VMNS matrix at the moment.

We have shown that it is possible to determine mass matrices for quarks and leptons under the assumption that they are triangular and that the matrices for upper and lower weak isospin components have zeros below or above main diagonal. The mixing matrices corresponding to diagonalization of weakly non-interacting right handed components are assumed in weak isodoublet to be equal. As an input the values of matrix elements for CKM and MNS matrices with known errors and masses of quarks and charged leptons and in the case of neutrinos squared mass differences also with corresponding errors are used. The masses of neutrinos are determined in the fit and the possible range of smallest neutrino mass is given. The U matrices for up type quarks and charged leptons are not very different from unit matrix. The V matrix for down type quarks is close to unit matrix and for neutrino matrix elements of mixing matrix are not small and comparable with Cabibbo mixing. In this solution U matrices for d type quarks and neutrinos are very close to measured VCKM and UMNS matrices. It was actually our aim to find out whether it is possible to get this type of solution. For up, down and charged leptons the non-diagonal matrix elements in the mass matrices are of the same order what is not expected taking into account masses of these particles (up and down type quarks and charged leptons). Neutrino masses have different scale (the hierarchy is rather weak) and some non-diagonal matrix elements are comparable with the diagonal. In the case of up and down type quarks we also calculated using our method mass matrices and mixing matrices taking into account CP violating phase.
