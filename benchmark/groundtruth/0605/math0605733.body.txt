The order of finite algebraic fundamental groups of surfaces with [formula]

Introduction

In this note we study the structure of [formula] for minimal surfaces of general type S satisfying K2S  ≤  3χ - 2 and not having any irregular étale cover.

In [\cite=mp] we have shown, among other things, that if S has no irregular étale cover and K2S  ≤  3χ - 1 then the order of [formula] is less than or equal to 9 and equality is only possible if χ(S) = 1. In this note we show some more results on the structure of [formula].

We want to remark that most of the present results are somehow implicit in [\cite=xiaohyp], but we think it is worthwhile spelling them out.

We prove the following:

Let S be a minimal algebraic surface of general type such that K2  ≤  3χ - 2 not having any irregular étale cover. Then the order of [formula] is at most 5, and equality only occurs if χ = 1 and K2 = 1 (i.e. S is a numerical Godeaux surface).

Let S be a minimal algebraic surface of general type such that K2  ≤  3χ - 3 not having any irregular étale cover. If [formula], then there are the following posibilities:

[formula];

[formula];

[formula]. In this case one has: 2  ≤  χ  ≤  4, K2 = 3χ - 3.

We remark that there are examples of surfaces with [formula] for all the values of χ and K2 given in (iii) of Theorem [\ref=main1].

For χ(S) = 2 see [\cite=mura], whilst for χ(S) = 3 it is enough to take S as an étale triple cover of the Campedelli surfaces with fundamental group of order 9 described in [\cite=pi9].

An example for χ = 4 is described in [\ref=example].

For details on Godeaux surfaces see for instance the introduction and the references in [\cite=ccm].

Notation We work over the complex numbers. All varieties are projective algebraic. All the notation we use is standard in algebraic geometry. We just recall the definition of the numerical invariants of a smooth surface S: the self-intersection number K2S of the canonical divisor KS, the geometric genus pg(S): = h0(KS) = h2(OS), the irregularity q(S): = h0(Ω1S) = h1(OS) and the holomorphic Euler characteristic χ(S): = 1 + pg(S) - q(S).

Some useful facts

We will use the following fundamental facts:

Let Y be a surface of general type such that the canonical map of Y has degree 2 onto a rational surface. If G is a group that acts freely on Y, then [formula], for some r.

Let Y be a regular surface of general type, let G  ≠  {1} be a finite group that acts freely on Y and let |F| be a G-invariant free pencil |F| of curves of genus g(F)  ≤  4. Then only the following possibilities can occur:

[formula], g(F) = 3 and G acts faithfully on |F|;

[formula], g(F) = 4;

[formula], g(F) = 3.

Assume that such a pencil |F| exists, let H be the subgroup of G consisting of the elements that act trivially on |F| and let h be the order of H. Set Y': = Y / H and S: = Y / G. The pencil |F| induces a free pencil |F'| on Y' with general fibre F': = F / H. Denote by [formula] the morphism given by |F'|. There is a cartesian diagram:

[formula]

where p is a G / H-cover and the general fibre of f is also equal to F'. The fibres of f over the branch points of p are multiple fibres, of multiplicity equal to the branching order. Hence, if G / H is nontrivial, then f has multiple fibres.

Since g(F') = 1 + (g(F) - 1) / h (recall that H acts freely), g(F)  ≤  4 and S is of general type, we get h  ≤  3.

Assume that |G|  ≥  4. Then G / H is not the trivial group and f has multiple fibres, hence g(F') > 2 by the adjunction formula. So the only possibility is h = 1, g(F) = 3 or 4 and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of [formula].

If g(F) = 3, then by the adjunction formula the multiple fibres of f are double fibres. Since every automorphism of [formula] has fixed points, this implies that every element of G has order 2. Hence [formula] for some r. Since [formula] does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to [formula], we have r  ≤  2.

If g(F) = 4, then by the adjunction formula the multiple fibres of f are triple fibres. Since every automorphism of [formula] has fixed points, this implies that every element of G has order 3. It is well known (cf. [\cite=sfera] or [\cite=enriques]) that a finite subgroup of [formula] is isomorphic to one of the following: [formula], [formula], the dihedral group Dn, the symmetric group S4, the alternating groups A4 and A5. It follows that [formula] in this case. So we have proven that the only possibility for |G|  ≥  4 is (i).

Statements (ii) and (iii) now follow from the adjunction formula.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

In this section we denote by S a surface satisfying the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=main], i. e., a surface such that K2S = 3χ - m, where m  ≥  2, having no irregular étale cover. Note that, by Theorem 1.3 of [\cite=mp], [formula].

We divide the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] in two steps.

Step 1: [formula].

Assume by contradiction that [formula] and let Y  →  S be the corresponding étale G-cover of degree d.

Since K2Y = dK2S = 3dχ(S) - dm = 3χ(Y) - dm < 3χ(Y) - 10, by [\cite=beauville] the canonical map of Y is generically finite of degree 2 and its image is a ruled surface Σ. The surface Y is regular and so Σ is a rational surface. Since [formula], by Proposition [\ref=be] we conclude that [formula].

So d = 8 and K2Y = 3χ(Y) - 8m.

Assume that m  ≥  3. Then [formula] and so, by Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=xiaohyp], Y has a unique free pencil of hyperelliptic curves of genus g  ≤  3. Since this pencil is necessarily G-invariant we have a contradiction to Lemma [\ref=free].

Suppose that m = 2. Then K2Y = 3χ(Y) - 16 < 3(χ(Y) - 5). If χ(Y)  ≥  24 (i. e. χ(S)  ≥  3), again by Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=xiaohyp], Y has a unique free pencil of hyperelliptic curves of genus g  ≤  3 and again we have the same contradiction. If χ(Y) = 16 (i. e. χ(S) = 2), then, by the Example on page 133 of [\cite=xiaohyp], either Y has a unique pencil of hyperelliptic curves of genus ≤  3 or Y is a double cover of [formula] with branch locus a curve of degree 14 with at most non-essential singularities. The first case can be excluded as before whilst the second case is excluded because Y admits no free involution (see the proof of Lemma 3 of [\cite=xiaohyp]).

If χ(S) = 1 then by Noether's inequality S cannot have an étale cover of degree 8 (the resulting Y would satisfy K2Y = 8 < 2χ - 6 = 10).

Step 2: If [formula], then S is a Godeaux surface.

Assume [formula] and let Y  →  S be the corresponding étale G-cover.

Then K2Y = 5K2S = 15χ(S) - 5m = 3χ(Y) - 5m. If m  ≥  3, then K2Y = 3χ(Y) - 5m < 3χ(Y) - 10 and so we obtain a contradiction as in Step 1, because [formula] has not order 5 for any n.

If m = 2, then the regular surface Y satisfies K2Y = 3χ - 10 = 3pg - 7 and by [\cite=ak] either the canonical map φ of Y is birational or it is a generically finite map of degree 2 on a rational surface. This last case is immediately excluded by Proposition [\ref=be].

So the canonical map φ of Y is birational. To show the claim we only need to show that χ(S)  ≥  2 does not occur in this situation. If χ(S)  ≥  2 then χ(Y)  ≥  10. So, by [\cite=ak], Y again has an unique free pencil of genus 3 curves and therefore, by Lemma [\ref=free], Y does not admit a free action by a group of order 5.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main1]

Here we prove Theorem [\ref=main1]. We continue assuming that S is a surface having no irregular étale cover and now we suppose that K2  ≤  3χ - 3.

By Theorem [\ref=main] the order of [formula] is less than or equal to 4. If the order of [formula] is 4, then the corresponding étale cover Y satisfies K2Y  ≤  3χ(Y) - 12. Since by [\cite=beauville] the canonical map of Y is 2-1 onto a rational surface, by Proposition [\ref=be] we have [formula].

Assume that [formula]. Then by the same argument one has K2S = 3χ(S) - 3, and the corresponding étale cover Y  →  S satisfies K2Y = 3χ(Y) - 9 = 3pg(Y) - 6.

Surfaces with these invariants have been classified by Konno ([\cite=konnopg]). If χ(Y)  ≥  13 and q(Y) = 0, then either the canonical map of Y is generically finite of degree 2 onto a rational surface, or the canonical map is birational and Y has a unique free pencil of genus 3 non-hyperelliptic curves. The first possibility does not occur by Proposition [\ref=be] and the second one does not occur by Lemma [\ref=free]. Therefore, if the order of [formula] is 3, then necessarily χ(Y)  ≤  12, i. e. χ(S)  ≤  4. Finally notice that χ(S) = 1 does not occur, since by assumption 3χ(S) - 3  ≥  K2S and K2S > 0 since S is of general type. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main1].

As explained in Remark [\ref=sharp], examples of surfaces with K2 = 3χ - 3 and [formula] are known in the literature for χ = 2,3. We describe here an example with χ = 4.

Consider homogeneous coordinates (x0,x1,x2) on [formula] and let [formula] act on [formula] by: (x0,x1,x2)  ↦  (x0,ωx1,ω2x2), where ω  ≠  1 is a cube root of 1. Consider [formula] with homogeneous coordinates [formula] and identify [formula] with the hyperplane of [formula] defined by z0 = 0. Denote by [formula] the homogeneous monomials of degree 3 in x0,x1,x2. The Veronese embedding of degree 3 [formula] is defined by letting zi = mi, [formula]. Denote by Σ the image of v and by [formula] the cone over Σ with vertex the point [formula]. The [formula]-action on [formula] induces a compatible action on [formula], which is diagonal with respect to the coordinates [formula]. We extend this action to [formula] by letting [formula] act on z0 as multiplication by ω. Clearly this action fixes the point P and maps the cone K to itself. We claim that the only fixed points of [formula] on K are P and the image points Q0,Q1,Q2∈Σ of the coordinate points of [formula]. In fact, let Q∈K, Q  ≠  P be a fixed point. Then the line < P,Q >  meets Σ in a point fixed by [formula], namely Q lies on one of the lines < P,Qi  >  , for some i∈{0,1,2}. So it is enough to show that [formula] acts non trivially on the line < P,Qi  >   for i = 0,1,2. This is easy to check, since the Qi are coordinate points in [formula] and the only nonzero coordinate of Qi is the one corresponding to the monomial x3i, hence [formula] acts on it as multiplication by 1.

Let now [formula] be the subspace of elements which are fixed by [formula]. Notice that [formula] are elements of T1, hence the system |T1| is free. Let V be the intersection of K with a general hypersurface of |T1|. Then by Bertini's theorem V is smooth, [formula]-invariant and the [formula]-action on V is free. One has KV  =  OV(1), K2V = 27, pg(V) = 11, q(V) = 0 (cf. [\cite=konnopg]). The quotient surface [formula] is smooth, minimal of general type with K2S = 9, q(S) = 0, χ(S) = 4. By Theorem [\ref=main1], V is the universal cover of S and S is an example of case (iii) of Theorem [\ref=main]. (One can also check directly that V is simply connected).
