Generalization of the Borel-Cantelli Lemma

Key words and phrases: Borel-Cantelli Lemma; Barndorff-Nielsen Lemma; strong limit theorems.

Introduction

Suppose in the following [formula] is a sequence of events on a common probability space and [formula] denotes the complement of the event Ai. The Borel-Cantelli Lemma (Lemma [\ref=lemma1]) is very important for producing strong limit theorems.

If for any sequence [formula] of events

[formula]

then P{An i.o.} = 0. If [formula] is a sequence of independent events and if [formula], then P{An i.o.} = 1.

The independence condition in the second part of this lemma have been weakened in some investigations. We mention here the works of Chung and Erdos (1952), Erdos and Renyi (1959), Lamperti (1963), Kochen and Stone (1964), Spitzer (1964), and Petrov (2002).

The first part of the Borel-Cantelli Lemma was generalized in Barndorff-Nielsen (1961) (Lemma [\ref=lemma2]).

Let An (n  ≥  1) be a sequence of events satisfying P{An}  →  0. Let also

[formula]

Then P{An i.o.} = 0.

The results of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holds true if in ([\ref=2]) the events [formula] are substituted with the events [formula]. Observe that condition ([\ref=2]) in the Barndorff-Nelson Lemma is weaker than condition ([\ref=1]) in the Borel-Cantelli Lemma.

In the present note we propose further generalization of Lemma [\ref=lemma1].

Results

Let An (n  ≥  1) be a sequence of events satisfying P{An}  →  0. Let also for some m  ≥  0

[formula]

Then P{An i.o.} = 0.

Observe that condition ([\ref=3]) when m  ≥  2 is weaker than condition ([\ref=2]) in Lemma [\ref=lemma2].

It can be formally shown that for any sequence [formula] of events the equality P{An i.o.}  =  α∈[0,1] holds iff [formula].
