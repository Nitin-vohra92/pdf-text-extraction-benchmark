Variations on an inequality from IMO'2001

Introduction

This paper is a continuation of [\cite=1] [\cite=2], where some natural generalizations of Problem 2 from IMO'2001 have been proved. Oir aim here is to consider some other extensions of the same problem which states:

Prove that

[formula]

where a,b and c are arbitrary positive numbers.

Many different proofs of this inequality were given during the Olym-piad and it was also shown by the first author that the following more general inequality holds:

[formula]

for arbitrary a,b,c > 0 and λ  ≥  8. It is easy to see that the latter inequality is not true for 0 < λ < 8. Moreover, it can be shown that in this case the infimum of the function in the left-hand side of (1) (when a,b and c run over all positive numbers) is equal to 1. This fenomenon led us to consider the following general problem:

Find the infimum and the supremum of the function

[formula]

on the set

[formula]

where λ > 0 and α are given real constants.

The infimum of Fα

We shall find the infimum of the function Fα on the set Hα by means of the well-known Lagrange multiplier criterion. The next proposition has been proved in [\cite=2], but we include it here to make the paper self-contained.

Proposition 1. For any α∈(0,1] we have

[formula]

Proof. Suppose first that [formula] is not attained at a point of Hλ. Then, [formula] where, for example, [formula] or +    ∞  . Hence, for example, [formula] or 0 and in both cases we see that d  ≥  1. Note that if [formula] for [formula] and [formula] then [formula] Now, let d is attained at a point of Hλ. Consider the function

[formula]

Then the Lagrange multiplier criterion says that d is attained at a point [formula] such that

[formula]

i.e., when

[formula]

Consider the function [formula] Then, [formula] and, therefore, g(x) takes each its value at most twice. Hence (2) shows that [formula] and [formula] for some 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. If k = n, then [formula] and [formula] If k < n, then

[formula]

To prove Proposition 1 it is sufficient to show that

[formula]

provided

[formula]

Set [formula] and t = (1 + y)α. Then (3) and (4) can be written respectively as z + t > zt and [formula] So, we have to prove that

[formula]

Assume that z < t and set [formula] Applying Bernoulli's inequality twice we obtain [formula] which is just the inequality (5).

The next example shows that for a given α > 1 a result similar to Proposition 1 could be expected only for sufficiently large n.

Example 1. Let α = 2 and n = 2. Then the function F2(x1,x2) attains minimum on Hλ given by

[formula]

Proof. To prove (6) we proceed as in the proof of Proposition 1. First note that if x1  →  0 or +    ∞  , then x2  →    +    ∞   or 0 and, in both cases, F2(x1,x2)  →  1. Consider the points (x1,x2)∈Hλ such that

[formula]

If x1 = x2  =  λ, then [formula] If x1  ≠  x2, then (7) is equivalent to [formula] This together with x1x2  =  λ2 implies that [formula] i.e., [formula] and [formula] Hence (6) follows from the inequalities [formula] and [formula] for any λ > 0, and [formula] for [formula]

The next proposition gives a partial result in the case α > 1.

Proposition 2. For any α > 1 and any integer n  ≥  α + 1 we have

[formula]

Proof. Proceeding as in the proof of Proposition 1 it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

for [formula] and 0 < u < 1. Since n - 1  ≥  α we have [formula] and it is enough to show that

[formula]

for β,u∈(0,1). Consider the function

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the equation f'(x) = 0 has a unique real root [formula] On the other hand, since f(0) = f(1) = 0 and β - 1 < 0, it follows that x0∈(0,1), f'(x) > 0 for x∈(0,x0) and f'(x) < 0 for x∈(x0,1). Hence f(x) > 0 for x∈(0,1) and the inequality (8) is proved.

Remark 1. As Example 1 suggests, if α > 1 and n < α + 1, then a result similar to Proposition 2 is not true. The authors do not know the value of [formula] for such α and n.

To complete this section it remains to consider the case α < 0.

Proposition 3. For any α < 0 the function [formula] attains minimum on Hλ given by

[formula]

Proof. We may proceed as in the proof of Proposition 1 but in this case the statement follows directly from the fact that the function [formula] is convex for α < 0 since f''(x) > 0.

The supremum of Fα

The results obtained in this section are dual analogs of that in Section 2.

Proposition 4. For any α  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

Proof. We proceed as in the proof of Proposition 1. If [formula] is not attained at a point of Hλ then we may assume that xn  →    +    ∞   and obviously we have [formula]. Note also that if [formula] and xn  →    +    ∞  , then [formula]

Next consider the case when [formula] is attained at a point of Hλ such that [formula] and [formula]. If x = y, then [formula] and [formula] If x  ≠  y, then k < n and [formula]. So, it is enough to prove that if [formula] and x < y, then [formula]. But this follows from the inequality [formula] which can be proved by using Bernoulli's inequality for [formula] as in the proof of Proposition 1.[formula]

The next example is dual to Example 1.

Example 2. Let [formula] and n = 2. Then the function [formula] attains maximum on Hλ given by

[formula]

Proof. First note that if x1  →  0 or +    ∞  , then x2  →    +    ∞   or 0, and, in both cases, [formula] Now consider the points (x1,x2)∈Hλ for which [formula] If x1 = x2, then [formula] If x1  ≠  x2, then x1 + x2  =  λ2(λ2 - 3) and since x1x2  =  λ2 we have λ > 2 and [formula] Hence (9) follows from the inequalities [formula] and [formula] for λ > 2, and [formula] for λ  ≤  2.

The dual analog of Proposition 2 is the following

Proposition 5. For any α∈(0,1) and any integer [formula] we have

[formula]

Proof. Proceedings as in the proof of Proposition 2 it is enough to show that [formula] for arbitrary u∈(0,1) and β > 1. This can be done in the same way as the proof of the inequality (8).[formula]

Finally, note that in the case α < 0 obviously the supremum of Fα is equal to +    ∞  .

Remark 2. As Example 2 suggests, if α∈(0,1) and [formula] then a result similar to Proposition 5 is not true. The authors do not know the value of [formula] for such α and n.
