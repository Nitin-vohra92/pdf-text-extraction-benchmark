A Note On Gorenstein Injective Dimension

Introduction

In 1976, Chouinard gave a general formula for injective dimension of a module, when it is finite (cf. [\cite=Chouinard]). Theorem. Let M be an R-module of finite injective dimension. Then

[formula]

Recall that for a module M over a local ring R,   RM is defined as the inf {  i  |    Ri(k,M)  ≠  0}, where k is the residue field of R. This gives a general formula from which the so called Bass formula can be concluded, namely, the injective dimension of a finite module over a local ring is either infinite or equals the depth of the base ring.

Our theorem [\ref=GCH] extends the chouinard's formula for Gorenstein injective dimension. Theorem. Let R be a noetherian ring and M an R-module of finite Gorenstein injective dimension. Then

[formula]

Main Theorem

An R-module G is said to be Gorenstein injective if and only if there exists an exact complex of injective R-modules,

[formula]

such that the complex   R(J,I) is exact for every injective R-module J and G is the kernel in degree 0 of I. The Gorenstein injective dimension of an R-module M,   R(M), is defined to be the infemum of integers n such that there exists an exact sequence

[formula]

with all Gi's Gorenstein injective.

Let R be a commutative noetherian ring and M an R-module of finite Gorenstein injective dimension. Then

[formula]

First assume that   R(M) = 0. By definition, there is an exact sequence

[formula]

such that every Ei is injective. Set Ki  =   ker (Ei - 1  →  Ei - 2). For any [formula] and every [formula]-module T, we have [formula] for any two positive integers i and t. Hence using [\cite=CFF] we get

[formula]

In addition, if [formula] is such that [formula] then, using [\cite=CFF] again, we get [formula]. Therefore, [formula] for a Gorenstein injective module M.

Now assume that n =   RM > 0. By [\cite=CFH], there exists a short exact sequence

[formula]

where K is Gorenstein injective and   RL =   RM = n. Thus

[formula]

On the other hand, by Chouinard's equality [\cite=C], we have

[formula]

For any [formula], we denote [formula]. Then, for any [formula], the exact sequence [formula] induces the long exact sequence

[formula]

This sequence gives rise to the following inequalities.

[formula]

If [formula] is such that [formula] then, by the mentioned inequalities, [formula] But for any [formula] with [formula], we also have [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

Let M be an R-module and [formula] prime ideals of R. If [formula] then
