On a recursive equation over p-adic field

introduction

The p-adic numbers were introduced by K. Hensel. For about a century after the inventing of the p-adic numbers, they were mainly considered objects of pure mathematics. After discovering that the physics of certain models could be based on the idea that the structure of space-time for very short distances might conveniently be described in terms of p-adic numbers, many applications of such numbers in theoretical physics have been proposed in works (see for example, [\cite=FW],[\cite=Kh1],[\cite=MP],[\cite=VVZ]). A number of p-adic models in physics cannot be described using ordinary probability theory based on the Kolmogorov axioms, therefore p-adic probability models were investigated in [\cite=Kh2]. Such models appear to provide the probabilistic interpretation of p-adic valued wave functions and string amplitudes in the framework of p-adic theoretical physics (see [\cite=Kh1] [\cite=Kh2]). Using such a p-adic probability approach in [\cite=MR1] [\cite=MR2] we have developed a theory of statistical mechanics in the context of that theory of probability. In statistical mechanics, due to their solvable character [\cite=B], Bethe lattice models and models on random tree-like graphs [\cite=DM], play a central role. In the calculation of the average magnetization of these models naturally appears the following recursive equation

[formula]

here [formula] and {hn} is an unknown sequence of real numbers, the solution of such a equation describes corresponding Gibbs measures. On certain conditions depending on parameters αk,βk,γk the equation ([\ref=eq]) has infinitely many solutions [\cite=BG],[\cite=G] (i.e. over real numbers), but all the set of solutions is still not described.

In the present paper we are going to completely describe the set of solutions of ([\ref=eq]) over p-adic numbers. Our hope is that this allows us further understanding of the Bethe lattice models and models on random tree-like graphs over p-adic numbers. Moreover, we think that the obtained result will give certain information on random rational p-adic dynamical systems generated by linear-fractional functions. Note that some applications of p-adic dynamical systems to some biological and physical systems have been proposed in [\cite=KhN].

Throughout the paper p will be a fixed prime number greater than 3, i.e. p  ≥  3. Every rational number x  ≠  0 can be represented in the form [formula], where [formula], m is a positive integer, (p,n) = 1, (p,m) = 1. The p-adic norm of x is given by

[formula]

It satisfies the following strong triangle inequality

[formula]

this is a non-Archimedean norm.

The completion of the field of rational numbers [formula] with respect to the p-adic norm is called p-adic field and it is denoted by [formula].

Given [formula] and r > 0 put

[formula]

The p-adic logarithm is defined by the series

[formula]

which converges for x∈B(1,1); the p-adic exponential is defined by

[formula]

which converges for x∈B(0,p- 1 / (p - 1)).

[\cite=Kl] Let x∈B(0,p- 1 / (p - 1)) then we have

[formula]

Main result

In this section we are going to completely describe the set of solutions of ([\ref=eq]) over p-adic numbers. Let us first formulate the problem in a p-adic setting. Namely, we are interested to find all solutions of the following recursive equation

[formula]

here [formula], such that

[formula]

and [formula] also should satisfy |hk|p < p- 1 / (p - 1) for every [formula], since these conditions ensure the existence of the p-adic log p and exp p.

Denote

[formula]

Let us rewrite ([\ref=eq1]) as follows

[formula]

here we have denoted

[formula]

Let us introduce

[formula]

The functions fk have the the following properties.

For every [formula] the following relations hold

[formula]

[formula]

The main result of the paper is the following

Let ([\ref=con]) be satisfied. Then |S|  ≤  1, here |A| means the number of elements of a set A.

Remark. Note that the proved Theorem provides some applications to the p-adic Bethe lattice models and models on random tree-like graphs. This would be a theme of our further investigations. We also think that the result can be applied for the study of dynamics of random rational p-adic dynamical systems. It should be also noted that certain type of recursive equations in p-adic numbers were considered in [\cite=M], they were related with transcendentality of the p-adic numbers. On the other hand, the method presented here used functional approach which is different from [\cite=M], where some number theoretical method was presented.

Now consider several cases when S is non empty.

Case 1. Let us assume that the following equality holds for every [formula], which implies that the equation ([\ref=eq2]) has a solution un = 1 for all [formula]. According to Theorem [\ref=3] it is unique, i.e. |S| = 1.

Case 2. Now suppose that ak = a, bk = b, ck = c for all [formula]. We are going to show the existence of a solution ([\ref=eq2]). Let us search a solution in a form un = u, [formula], here u is unknown. Then ([\ref=eq2]) reduces to the equation f(u) = u, where

[formula]

Put [formula]. Let us show that f(D)  ⊂  D. Indeed, let x∈D, then |x|p = 1, |x - 1|p < p- 1 / (p - 1). According to Lemma [\ref=1] this means that x =  exp p(y) for some y∈B(0,p- 1 / (p - 1)). Now by means of Lemma [\ref=2] we infer that |f(x)|p = 1. The strong triangle inequality with

[formula]

implies that

[formula]

Using the same argument along the proof of Lemma [\ref=2] one gets

[formula]

Thus from the inequalities [\eqref=ineq2], [\eqref=eq5] we obtain that f is a contraction of D, hence f has a unique fixed point ζ∈D. Consequently, S is non empty. Now Theorem [\ref=3] yields that |S| = 1.
