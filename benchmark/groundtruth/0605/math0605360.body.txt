Introduction

Let M be an n-dimensional complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In [\cite=MSY] Mok, Siu and Yau proved that if a complete noncompact [formula] manifold of nonnegative and bounded holomorphic bisectional curvature of complex dimension n  ≥  2 has maximal volume growth and the scalar curvature decays faster than quadratically, then M is isometrically biholomorphic to Cn. This can be interpreted as a gap phenomena of the bisectional curvature on [formula] manifolds. Later Greene and Wu [\cite=GW] generalized this gap phenomena to Riemannian manifolds.

Recently Chen-Zhu [\cite=CZ1] use the theory of Ricci flow and Yamabe flow to prove the following gap theorem on locally conformally flat Riemannian manifolds. They showed that:

(Chen-Zhu) Let M be an n-dimensional (n  ≥  3) complete noncompact locally conformally flat Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. The scalar curvature is bounded and decays faster than quadratically, then M is Ricci flat.

Now we wonder whether a similar result holds on a general manifold. For a complete K[formula]hler manifold with bounded and nonnegative biholomorphic sectional curvature, if the scalar curvature decays faster than quadratically, then Chen-Zhu ([\cite=CZ2]) proved that the metric is Ricci flat. From [\cite=Y] or [\cite=CH], we know that the decaying condition of scalar curvature in Theorem 1.1 is sharp. So we consider the manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In [\cite=NST1], Ni-Shi-Tam proved that for any complete K[formula]hler manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and maximal volume growth, if the curvature tensor decays faster than quadratically, then the metric is Ricci flat.

Recently, Kim [\cite=K] improved Cabre's Harnack inequality [\cite=C] for nondivergent elliptic operators on manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature and obtained the Harnack inequality for Laplacian operators only assumption of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature.

(Kim) For any n-dimensional complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, if u is a smooth function in a ball Bx0(2r) satisfying u > 0 in Bx0(2r), then

[formula]

where C is a positive constant only depending on n , |Bx0(2r)| and ||  ·  ||Lp(Bx0(2r)) denotes respectively the volume of the ball Bx0(2r) and the Lp norm on the ball Bx0(2r).

In fact, Kim proved a Harnack inequality for the nondivergent elliptic operator on a more general manifold, one can see [\cite=K] for reference. For our purpose, we only need the Harnack inequality for Laplacian operators on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In this note, we will use this Harnack inequality to prove the following gap theorem on Riemannian manifolds:

Let M be any n-dimensional complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, if the scalar curvature R(x) decays faster than quadratically, i.e. for [formula], there exists positive constants C and ε such that

[formula]

then M is Ricci flat.

Proof of Theorem 1.3

Now we consider the Poisson equation on M:

[formula]

In [\cite=NST2], Ni-Shi-Tam gave the following sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of solution of the Poisson equation (1):

(Ni-Shi-Tam) Let f  ≥  0 be a function on a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Then [formula] has a bounded solution if and only if there is a positive constant C such that

[formula]

Taking f(x) = R(x), then equation (1) become

[formula]

Since the scalar curvature R(x) decays faster than quadratically, then it satisfies condition (2). So from Lemma 2.1, we know that equation (1') has a bounded solution. Thus we can always assume that inf Mu = 0, otherwise adding a constant to u. Hence for any ε > 0, u(x0)  ≤  ε for some x0∈M. By Theorem 1.2, we have that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let p  →    ∞  , since the scalar curvature decays faster than quadratically, then above inequality become

[formula]

Let r  →    ∞  ,ε  →  0, because the constant C independent on r, we know that [formula]. Thus from (1') we conclude that [formula]. Since the Ricci curvature is nonnegative, then it is flat. So we complete the proof of Theorem 1.3.
