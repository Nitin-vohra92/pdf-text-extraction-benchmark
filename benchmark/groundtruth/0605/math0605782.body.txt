A construction of two distinct canonical sets of lifts of Brauer characters of a p-solvable group

Lemma Corollary Proposition Definition Remark Example

1. Introduction. Let p be a prime, G a finite p-solvable group, and for a class function α of G, let α0 denote the restriction of α to the p-regular elements of G. The celebrated Fong-Swan Theorem asserts that if φ is an irreducible Brauer character of G for the prime p, then there necessarily exists an ordinary irreducible character χ of G such that χ0  =  φ. Such a character χ is called a lift of φ. In [\cite=bpi], Isaacs constructs a canonical set of lifts [formula], such that for each Brauer character φ of G, there is a unique lift of φ in [formula]. Similarly, in [\cite=npiconst], Navarro constructs another canonical set (G|Q,1Q) (which we will denote by [formula]) of lifts of the irreducible Brauer characters of G. Navarro conjectured but did not prove that [formula]. In this paper we give conditions under which [formula], and give an example to show that these sets need not be equal in general.

Let π be a set of primes, and denote by π' the complement of π. (In the classical case, π is the complement of the prime p.) Let G be a π-separable group. In [\cite=gajen], Gajendragadkar constructs a certain class of characters, called the π-special characters of G. An irreducible character χ is π-special if (a) χ(1) is a π-number and (b) if whenever [formula] and θ∈(S) lies under χ, then the order of (θ), as a character of S / S', is a π-number. These π-special characters are known to have many interesting properties, and they are necessary for constructing the sets of characters under discussion in this paper. In particular, if α∈(G) is π-special and β∈(G) is π'-special, then αβ∈(G) and this factorization is unique. If χ∈(G) can be written in this factored form, we say that χ is π-factorable and we let χπ and χπ' be the π-special and π'-special factors of χ, respectively. In addition, if [formula] has π'-index in G, and if γ∈(M) is π-special and invariant in G, then there is a unique π-special character α∈(G) such that α extends γ. If γ∈(M) is π-special and [formula] with G / M is a π- group, then every character α∈(G|γ) is π-special.

We now briefly review Isaacs' construction of [formula] in [\cite=bpi] and Navarro's construction of the similar set, (G|Q,1Q). In [\cite=bpi] Isaacs proves that if G is π-separable, and if χ∈(G), then there is a unique (up to conjugacy) pair (S,φ) maximal with the property that [formula], φ∈(S) lies under χ, and φ is π-factorable. Such a pair (S,φ) is called a maximal factorable subnormal pair. Denote by T the stabilizer of φ in the normalizer in G of S. Isaacs then shows that if S  ≠  G, then T  <  G and induction defines a bijection from (T|φ) to (G|φ). Therefore, we can let ψ∈(T) be the unique character of T lying over φ such that ψG  =  χ. The subnormal nucleus (W,γ) of χ is then defined recursively by defining (W,γ) to be the subnormal nucleus of ψ. (If χ is π-factorable, then (W,γ) is defined to be (G,χ).) Note that by the construction, γG  =  χ and γ is π-factorable. Also, it is shown that the subnormal nucleus of χ is unique up to conjugacy. The set π(G) is defined as the set of irreducible characters of G whose nucleus character γ is π-special.

In [\cite=npiconst], Navarro similarly defines the set (G|Q,1Q) for a p-solvable group G. Navarro shows that if χ∈(G), then there is a unique pair (N,θ) maximal with the property that [formula], θ∈(N) lies under χ, and θ is p-factorable. Such a pair is called a maximal factorable normal pair. It is shown that if N  <  G, then Gθ  <  G, and thus the Clifford correspondence implies that if T  =  Gθ, there is a unique character ψ∈(T|θ) such that ψG  =  χ. Navarro then defines the normal nucleus (U,ε) to be the normal nucleus of (T,ψ). (Again, if χ is p-factorable, then (U,ε)  =  (G,χ).) Note that again εG  =  χ and ε is p-factorable. If Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of U, and if δ∈(Q) is defined by δ  =  (εp)Q, then we say the pair (Q,δ) is a normal vertex for χ, and it is shown that this pair and the normal nucleus are unique up to conjugacy. The set (G|Q,1Q) is defined as {χ∈(G)|δ  =  1Q}, or equivalently, the set of irreducible characters of G with a p'-special normal nucleus character. Although Navarro only defines the set (G|Q,δ) when π  =  p' and G is p-solvable, the same construction of the normal nucleus and vertex of a character works if π is an arbitrary set of primes and G is π-separable. In this case, we will define the set π(G) to be (G|Q,1Q), only now Q is a Hall π'-subgroup of the normal nucleus subgroup U of χ. Thus [formula] consists of those irreducible characters of G with a π-special subnormal nucleus character, and [formula] consists of those characters of G with a π-special normal nucleus character.

Recall that if χ is any class function of the π-separable group G, then χ0 denotes the restriction of χ to the elements of G whose order is a π-number. Moreover, the set [formula] is a generalization of Brauer characters in a p-solvable group G to a set of primes π (so that if π  =  p', and if G is p-solvable, then the set [formula] is exactly the set of Brauer characters of G for the prime p.). In [\cite=bpi] it is shown that if [formula], then [formula], and in [\cite=npiconst] it is shown that if [formula], then [formula]. Both π(G) and π(G) are canonical sets of lifts of π(G); in other words, if [formula], then there is a unique character [formula] and a unique character [formula] such that χ0  =  η0  =  φ. Moreover, Isaacs shows that if [formula] and [formula], then every constituent θ of χN is in [formula].

We will need the following results. In [\cite=pispecial], Isaacs defines, for a subgroup H of a π-separable group G (where [formula]), a linear character δ(G:H)∈(H), called the standard sign character of H. This theorem lists some of the properties of δ(G:H).

Theorem 1.1. Let G be π-separable with [formula], and let δ be the standard sign character for some subgroup H of G. Then the following hold:

If |G:H| is a π-number and H is a maximal subgroup of G, then δ is the permutation sign character of the action of H on the right cosets of H in G.

[formula].

Suppose H  ⊆  G has π index. If ψ∈(H) and ψG  =  χ∈(G), then χ is π-special if and only if δψ is π-special.

Proof. This is the content of Theorems 2.5 and B of [\cite=pispecial] and Lemma 2.1 of [\cite=pipartial]. [formula]

The aims of this paper, then, are threefold. First, we prove the statement made (without proof) in [\cite=npiconst] that if p is an odd prime, the sets p'(G) and p'(G) coincide. Secondly, we give a counterexample to show that if 2∈π', then π(G) and π(G) need not coincide. Finally, we use the same counterexample to show that if η∈π(G) and [formula], then it need not be the case that the constituents of ηM are themselves in π(M).

2. Equality occurs if G has odd order. In this section we give a brief proof that if |G| is odd or if 2∈π, then π(G)  =  π(G). This result was stated without proof in [\cite=npiconst]. Here the field [formula] is defined by adjoining the nth roots of unity to [formula] for every π-number n.

Lemma 2.1. Let G be π-separable and assume 2∈π or |G| is odd. Assume χ∈(G) has values in [formula] and that [formula]. Then χ∈π(G).

Proof. This is Theorem 12.3 of [\cite=bpi]. [formula]

Lemma 2.2. Let G be π-separable, and suppose η∈π(G). Then [formula] for all elements g∈G.

Proof. Let σ be any automorphism of [formula] that fixes the nth roots of unity for every π-number n. Clearly ησ∈π(G) by the construction of π(G). If η0  =  φ∈π(G), then since the values of φ are in [formula], then φσ  =  φ. Since η is the unique lift of φ in π(G), then it must be that ησ  =  η. Thus the values of η are in [formula]. [formula]

Corollary 2.3. If G is π-separable and 2∈π or |G| is odd, then π(G)  =  π(G).

Proof. Since π(G) and π(G) are both sets of lifts of π(G), then |π(G)|  =  |π(G)|. By Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, π(G)  ⊆  π(G). Thus π(G)  =  π(G). [formula]

3. A counterexample of even order. In this section we construct the aforementioned counterexample to show that π(G) need not equal π(G), and we show that the constituents of the restriction of a character in [formula] to a normal subgroup V need not be in [formula].

Suppose Γ is a finite group of order n, and let p be a prime number. Let E be an elementary abelian group of order pn. Then we can let Γ act on E by associating to each element x∈Γ one of the cyclic factors of E, and let the left multiplication action of Γ on itself induce an action on the factors of E. Let G be the semidirect product of Γ acting on E with this action. Then for each subgroup L of G such that E  ⊆  L  ⊆  G, we see that there is an irreducible character θ of E such that Gθ  =  L.

Construction: Let S1 be isomorphic to the symmetric group on four elements, and let A1 be isomorphic to the alternating group on four elements. Define the group U1 as the semidirect product of S1 acting on A1 with the conjugation action, so that U1  =  A1S1 and [formula]. Let K1 be the normal Klein four group in A1, and note that [formula]. Define the element x∈S1 by setting x equal to the permutation (12). Note that [formula]. Let H1  =  〈A1,x〉, and notice that H1 is not subnormal in U1, [formula], and [formula]. Let L1  ⊆  U1 be such that K1  ⊆  L1  ⊆  H1 and |H1:L1|  =  3. Note that [formula] and L1A1  =  H1. Moreover, note that [formula].

Let U2 be isomorphic to U1, set V0  =  U1  ×  U2, and define Γ as the semidirect product of [formula] acting on V0, with the nontrivial element of [formula] acting by interchanging the components of V0. Note that [formula], and [formula].

Let |Γ|  =  n, and let E be an elementary abelian group of order 3n. Let G be the semidirect product as defined in the paragraph preceding this construction, so that [formula]. Therefore there is a character θ∈(E) such that Gθ  =  EL1. Set L  =  EL1, A = EA1, K  =  EK1, H  =  EH1, and V  =  EV0.

Set π  =  {3} and note that G is solvable. Since E is a 3-group, then θ is π-special. Note that the π-special character θ extends to a unique π-special character ∈(K). We see that since θ and [formula] uniquely determine each other, then [formula]. Therefore ∈(K) induces irreducibly to a π-special character φ∈(A). Since φ is uniquely determined by θ, and L normalizes A, then L  =  Gθ  ⊆  Gφ.

We now show that Gφ  =  H. By a Frattini argument, we see that Gφ  ⊆  GθA  =  H. Since φ∈(A), then clearly A  ⊆  Gφ. We showed in the previous paragraph that L  =  Gθ  ⊆  Gφ. Thus H  =  AL  ⊆  Gφ and therefore Gφ  =  H.

We now claim that (E,θ) is a maximal factorable normal pair. Recall that [formula] is trivial, and thus [formula] is trivial. Suppose there exists a factorable normal pair (N,ψ) such that E  ⊆  N and θ lies under ψ, and suppose N / E is a nontrivial 2-group. Then the π-special factor of ψ must restrict to θ, and thus θ must be invariant in N. Therefore N  ⊆  Gθ  =  L. However, [formula] is trivial, and this yields a contradiction. Thus (E,θ) is a maximal factorable normal pair.

We also claim that (A,φ) is a maximal factorable subnormal pair. Suppose (S,σ) is a factorable subnormal pair such that [formula] and σ lies over φ, and suppose S / A is a nontrivial 2-group. Since φ∈(A) is π-special, φ must be invariant in S, and thus S  ⊆  Gφ  =  H. Since |H:A|  =  2 and H is not subnormal in G, we have a contradiction. Since there are no subnormal subgroups T of G such that [formula] and T / A is a nontrivial 3-group, then (A,φ) is a maximal factorable subnormal pair.

Note that since |L:K| = 2 and the π-special character ∈(K) is invariant in L, then [formula] extends to a π-special character ξ∈(L), and we define η∈(G) by η  =  ξG. Note that θ lies under η, and since (E,θ) is a maximal factorable normal pair, and the Clifford correspondent ξ∈(Gθ|θ) for η is π-special, then [formula].

We now show that η is not in [formula]. Note that ξH∈(H), and since φ∈(A) is exactly (ξK)A  =  (ξH)A, then φ lies under both ξH and η. Recall that (A,φ) is a maximal factorable subnormal pair, and H  =  Gφ. Since |H:A|  =  2 and φ∈(A) is π-special, every character of H lying over φ must be π-factorable. Thus (H,ξH) is a subnormal nucleus for η, and [formula] if and only if ξH is π-special.

Let δ  =  δ(H:L)∈(L) be the standard sign character for L  ⊆  H. Note that [formula]. Therefore we see that δ is the nonprincipal linear character of L / K. Since ξ∈(L) is π-special and δ∈(L) is π'-special, then ξδ∈(L) is not π-special. Thus ξH is not π-special by Theorem 1.1. Therefore, since (H,ξH) is a subnormal nucleus for η, then η is not in [formula].

Finally, note that (H,ξH) is a normal nucleus for ξV, which lies under η. Since ξH is not π-special, then ξV is not π-special, and the constituents of ηV are not in [formula]. [formula]

The above example raises some interesting questions. Are there other families of characters which form lifts of the set [formula]? Some results in this direction can be found in forthcoming papers of Mark Lewis. What in general can be said about the set of lifts of a Brauer character of a p-solvable group G? In a future paper, the author will describe some bounds on the number of lifts of a Brauer character of a p-solvable group. There is still much to be known, though, about the set of lifts of a Brauer character of a p-solvable group.
