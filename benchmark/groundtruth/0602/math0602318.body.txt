On Generalized Numerical Ranges of Quadratic Operators

Introduction

Let A be a bounded linear operator acting on a complex Hilbert space H. Recall that the numerical range W(A) of A is defined as

[formula]

If c is a k-tuple of non-zero (in general, complex) numbers [formula], then the c- numerical range of A is

[formula]

Of course, if c consists of just one number c1 = 1, Wc(A) is nothing but the regular numerical range of A. Also, for [formula], the c-numerical range Wc(A) turns into Wk(A) - the so called k- numerical range introduced by Halmos, see [\cite=Ha]. Finally, the essential numerical range introduced in [\cite=StWil68] can be defined [\cite=FilStWil72] as

[formula]

where the intersection is taken over all compact on H operators K, and the symbol cl denotes the topological closure. Considering Wc(A) or Wess(A), we will implicitly suppose that dim H  ≥  k or that H is infinite dimensional, respectively.

There are several monographs devoted to the numerical range and its various generalizations (including those mentioned above), see for example [\cite=BoDu73] [\cite=GusRa]. We mention here only the results which are of direct relevance to the subject of this paper.

From the definitions it is clear that all three sets are unitarily invariant:

[formula]

for any unitary operator U on H. Also, they behave in a nice and predictable way under affine transformations of A:

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any [formula].

It is a classical result (known as the Hausdorff-Toeplitz theorem) that the set W(A) is convex. Clearly, Wess(A) is therefore convex as well. The c-numerical range is convex if all cj lie on the same line passing through the origin but not in general [\cite=West75]. In what follows, we suppose that cj satisfy the above mentioned condition. Moreover, since

[formula]

we then may (and will) without loss of generality suppose that all cj are real. We will also arrange them in the non-increasing order:

[formula]

since permutations of cj leave Wc(A) invariant.

When dim H = 2, the numerical range of A is the closed (as is always the case in finite dimensional setting) elliptical disc with the foci at the eigenvalues λ1,λ2 of A and the minor axis [formula] (the elliptic range theorem, see, e.g., [\cite=GusRa]). According to the Cayley - Hamilton theorem, A in this setting satisfies the equation

[formula]

with

[formula]

For arbitrary H, operators A satisfying ([\ref=quad]) with some [formula] are called quadratic operators.

Rather recently, Tso and Wu showed that W(A) is an elliptical disc (open or closed) for any quadratic operator A, independent of the dimension of H [\cite=TsoWu].

In this paper, we continue considering the (generalized) numerical ranges of quadratic operators. We start by stating Tso-Wu's result and outlining its proof (different from one presented in [\cite=TsoWu]), in order to show how it can be modified to prove ellipticity of the essential numerical ranges of quadratic operators. We then use the combination of the two statements to derive some sufficient conditions for the c-numerical range to also have an elliptical shape. This is all done in Section 1. Section 2 is devoted to concrete implementations of these results.

Main results

Classical numerical range

We begin with the Tso-Wu result.

Let the operator A satisfy equation ([\ref=quad]). Then W(A) is the elliptical disc with the foci [formula] and the major/minor axis of the length

[formula]

Here [formula], and the set W(A) is closed when the norm [formula] is attained and open otherwise.

As in [\cite=TsoWu], observe first that ([\ref=quad]) guarantees unitary similarity of A to an operator of the form

[formula]

acting on [formula], where dim Hj  (  ≥  0) are defined by A uniquely, and X is a positive definite operator on H3. According to the first of properties ([\ref=uninv]), we may suppose that A itself is of the form ([\ref=canA]).

Using the first of formulas ([\ref=aff]) we may further suppose that μ = 0 and ν  ≥  0; in other words, that in ([\ref=canA])

[formula]

The case H3  =  {0} corresponds to the normal operator A when W(A) is the closed line segment connecting λ1 and λ2. This is in agreement with formula ([\ref=axes]) when ν  ≠  0, since in this case [formula] is attained, and [formula]. In the trivial case s = 0 (when the operator A is scalar and W(A) degenerates into a single point) formula ([\ref=axes]) formally speaking is not valid since s- 1 is not defined. However, the relation between s and ν justifies the convention νs- 1 = 0 in this case.

In the non-trivial case dim H3 > 0 our argument is different from that in [\cite=TsoWu]. Namely, we will make use of the fact that the (directed) distance from the origin to the support line [formula] with the slope θ of W(A) is the maximal point ωθ of the spectrum of [formula]. Moreover, [formula] actually contains points of W(A) if and only if ωθ belongs to the point spectrum of [formula].

For A of the form ([\ref=canA]) with λj as in ([\ref=la]),

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

For any ω  ≠  λ sin θ, the last direct summand in ([\ref=re]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] is the rightmost point of the spectrum of [formula]. In other words, the support lines of W(A) are the same as of the numerical range of the 2  ×  2 matrix

[formula]

The description of W(A) as the elliptical disc with the foci and axes as given in the statement of the theorem follows from here and the elliptic range theorem.

Moreover, ωθ is an eigenvalue of [formula] if and only if the norm of X (or equivalently, of A itself) is attained, so that this either happens for all θ or for none of them. In the former case, every support line of W(A) must contain at least one of its points, and the elliptical disc W(A) is closed. In the latter case, the support lines are disjoint with W(A), so that it is open.

Remark. Formula ([\ref=axes]) is formally different from the result of [\cite=TsoWu], where the lengths of the axes of W(A) are given in terms of [formula], not [formula]. The two operators coincide when μ2  +  ν = 0. If this is not the case, the relation between their norms follows from the general property

[formula]

of any projection P and associated with it involution S = 2P - I (see [\cite=Spit80]) applied to P = (A - λ1I) / (λ2  -  λ1) and [formula].

As a matter of fact, the relation between A and involution operators shows that A can be represented as a (rather simple) function of two orthogonal projections. This observation allows to describe the spectra and norms of all operators involved in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:w] straightforwardly, using the machinery developed in [\cite=Spitkov]. We chose an independent exposition, in the interests of self containment.

Essential numerical range

We now move to the essential numerical range of quadratic operators. If A satisfies ([\ref=quad]) and one of its eigenvalues (say λ1) has finite multiplicity, then in representation ([\ref=canA]) the spaces H1 and H3 are finite dimensional. Thus, A differs from λ2I by a compact summand, and Wess(A) is a single point. Let us exclude this trivial situation, that is, suppose that σess(A) = σ(A) = {λ1,λ2}.

From ([\ref=wess]) it is clear that the support lines [formula] with the slope θ are at the distance ωessθ from the origin. Here ωessθ is the maximal point of the essential spectrum of [formula]. This observation allows to repeat the statement and the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:w] almost literally, inserting the word "essential" where appropriate (of course, the last paragraph of the proof becomes irrelevant since the essential numerical range is always closed). We arrive at the following statement.

Let the operator A satisfy equation ([\ref=quad]), with both eigenvalues [formula] having infinite multiplicity. Then Wess(A) is the closed elliptical disc with the foci λ1,2 and the major/minor axis of the length [formula], where s0 is the essential norm of A - μI.

In the trivial case s0 = 0 (when A differs from μI by a compact summand, so that necessarily μ2  +  ν = 0) we by convention set [formula]. This agrees with the fact that Wess(A) then degenerates into a singleton μ.

Let the operator A satisfying ([\ref=quad]) be such that

[formula]

Then the elliptical disc W(A) is closed.

Indeed, ([\ref=ineqnor]) holds if and only if [formula] for X from ([\ref=canA]). Being positive definite, the operator X then has [formula] as its eigenvalue. In other words, the norm of X (and therefore of A - μI) is attained. It remains to invoke the last statement of Theorem [\ref=th:w].

-numerical range

The behavior of Wc(A), even for quadratic operators, is more complicated; see [\cite=ChienTsoWu] for some observations on the k-numerical range. With no additional assumptions on A, we give only a rather weak estimate. In what follows, it is convenient to use the notation [formula].

Let A be as in Theorem  [\ref=th:wess]. Denote by s and s0 the norm and essential norm of A - μI respectively, and by E and E0 two elliptical discs with the foci at [formula], the first - closed, with the axes [formula] and the second - open, with the axes [formula]. Then Wc(A) contains E0 and is contained in E.

Using ([\ref=affc]) we may, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:w], without loss of generality suppose that μ = 0, ν  ≥  0. Since all the sets E, E0 and Wc(A) are convex, we need only to show that the support line to Wc(A) in any direction lies between the respective support lines to E0 and E. In other words, the quantity

[formula]

must lie between

[formula]

with X given by ([\ref=canA]). But this is indeed so, because ([\ref=id]) implies that the spectrum and the essential spectrum of [formula] have the endpoints [formula] and [formula], respectively.

An interesting situation occurs when the norm of A - μI coincides with its essential norm (equivalently, [formula] for X from ([\ref=canA])), so that E is simply the closure of E0. To state the explicit result, denote by m± the number of positive/negative coefficients cj and let m =  max {m+,m-}.

Let A be as in Theorem  [\ref=th:wess], and on top of that

[formula]

Define E and E0 as in Lemma [formula]. Then Wc(A) coincides with E if the norm of A - μI is attained on the subspace of the dimension at least m, and with E0 otherwise.

Consider first a simpler case when in([\ref=canA]) dim H3  <    ∞  . Then due to ([\ref=eqnor]) H3  =  {0}, so that the operator A is normal. The norm [formula] of A - μI is attained on infinite dimensional subspaces H1 and H2, and Wc(A) is the closed line segment connecting the points [formula] and [formula]. This segment apparently coincides with E.

Let now H3 be infinitely dimensional. From Lemma [\ref=l:wc] it follows that Wc(A) lies between E and its interior E0, so that the only question is which points of the boundary of E belong to Wc(A). It follows from ([\ref=id]) that the minimal and maximal points of the spectrum of [formula] have the same multiplicity as its eigenvalues, this multiplicity does not depend on θ and coincides in fact with the dimension d (≥  0) of the subspace on which the norm of X is attained. From ([\ref=canA]) under conditions ([\ref=la]) it follows that the norm of A - μI is attained on a d-dimensional subspace as well.

On the other hand, the supremum in ([\ref=sup]) is attained if and only if this multiplicity is at least m. Thus, the boundary of E belongs to Wc(A) if d  ≥  m and is disjoint with Wc(A) otherwise.

Examples

We consider here several concrete examples illustrating the above stated abstract results. All the operators A involved happen to be involutions which corresponds to the choice μ = 0, ν = 1 in ([\ref=quad]). According to Theorems [\ref=th:w] and [\ref=th:wess], the major/minor axes of the elliptical discs W(A) and Wess(A) then have the lengths

[formula]

respectively.

Singular integral operators on closed curves

Let Γ be the union of finitely many simple Jordan rectifiable curves. Suppose that the number of its points of self-intersection is finite, and that Γ partitions the extended complex plane [formula] into two open disjoint (not necessarily connected) sets D+ and D-. Moreover, we suppose that Γ is the common boundary of D+ and D-, and that it is oriented in such a way that the points of D± lie to the left/right of Γ.

The singular integral operator S with the Cauchy kernel is defined by

[formula]

It acts as an involution [\cite=GKru92] on the linear manifold of all rational functions with the poles off Γ, dense in the Hilbert space H = L2(Γ), with respect to the Lebesque measure on Γ. This operator is bounded in L2 norm, and can therefore be continued to the involution acting on the whole L2(Γ), if and only if Γ is the so called Carleson curve. This result, along with the definition of Carleson curves, as well as detailed proofs and the history of the subject, can be found in [\cite=BK97]. For our purposes it suffices to know that S is a bounded involution when the curve Γ is piecewise smooth, i.e., admits a piecewise continuously differentiable parametrization.

If Γ is a circle or a line, then S is in fact selfadjoint, and both its norm and essential norm are equal to 1. This situation is trivial from our point of view, since W(S) and Wess(S) then coincide with the closed interval

[formula]

. its appropriate scalar multiple.

As it happens [\cite=Kru91], circles and lines are the only simple closed curves in [formula] for which S is selfadjoint. On the other hand, for all smooth simple closed curves the essential norm of S is the same, that is, equal to 1 (see [\cite=GKru92] for Lyapunov curves; the validity of the result for general smooth curves rests on the compactness result from [\cite=Gru80] and is well known within singular integral community). Thus, lines and circles are the only smooth closed curves in [formula] for which the norm and the essential norm of S coincide. However, such a coincidence is possible for other piecewise smooth (even simple) curves.

One such case occurs when Γ is a bundle of m lines passing through a common point, or of m circles passing through two common points. According to [\cite=GalKru], then

[formula]

with the last inequality turning into equality for at least m  =  1,2,3. Respectively, for such curves Γ the sets W(S), Wess(S) are the ellipses with the foci at ±  1, coinciding up to the boundary, and with the major axes of the length at least [formula]. This length equals [formula] for m = 2,3. The c-numerical range of S is the same ellipse, only scaled by [formula].

The equality [formula] also holds for Γ consisting of circular arcs (one of which can degenerate into a line segment) connecting the same two points in [formula] [\cite=Ave] [\cite=AveKru]; in order for an appropriate orientation on Γ to exist the number of these arcs must be even. If, in particular, there are two of them (that is, the curve Γ is simple), then

[formula]

where

[formula]

and π(1 - φ) is the angle between the arcs forming Γ [\cite=Ave]. The ellipses W(S), Wess(S) therefore have the major axes of the length [formula].

For some particular values of φ the explicit value of Dφ can be easily computed, see [\cite=Ave]. If, for instance, Γ consists of a half circle and its diameter, that is φ  =  1 / 2, then [formula]. Respectively, the major axes of W(S) and Wess(S) have the length [formula].

It would be interesting to describe all curves Γ for which the norm and the essential norm of the operator ([\ref=S]) are the same.

Singular integral operators on weighted spaces on the circle

Let now Γ be the unit circle [formula]. We again consider the involution ([\ref=S]), this time with H being the weighted Lebesgue space L2ρ. The norm on this space is defined by

[formula]

where the weight ρ is an a.e. positive measurable and square integrable function on [formula]. In this setting, the operator S is closely related with the Toeplitz and Hankel operators on Hardy spaces, weighted or not. All needed definitions and "named" results used below and not supplied with explicit references conveniently can be found in the exhaustive recent monograph [\cite=Peller].

Involution S is bounded on L2ρ if and only if ρ2 satisfies the Helson-Szeg condition, that is, can be represented as

[formula]

[\cite=Peller]. This condition is equivalent to

[formula]

where

[formula]

ρ+ is the outer function such that [formula] a.e. on [formula], and Hω denotes the Hankel operator Hω with the symbol ω acting from the (unweighted) Hardy space H2 to its orthogonal complement in L2. It is also equivalent to invertibility of the Toeplitz operator Tω on H2. Moreover [\cite=FKS96],

[formula]

and a similar relation holds for the essential norms of S and Hω. But

[formula]

(Nehari theorem [\cite=Peller]) and

[formula]

(Adamyan-Arov-Krein theorem [\cite=Peller]), where H∞ is the Hardy class of bounded analytic in [formula] functions, and its sum with the set C of continuous on [formula] functions is the Douglas algebra H∞ + C. Thus, the ellipses W(S) and Wess(S) have the major axes

[formula]

respectively.

The norm of S is attained only simultaneously with the norm of Hω. This happens, in particular, if Hω is compact, that is ω∈H∞ + C. The latter condition can be restated directly in terms of ρ [\cite=FKS96] and means that log ρ∈VMO, where VMO (the class of functions with vanishing mean oscillation) is the sum of C with its harmonic conjugate [formula].

Thus, for all the weights ρ such that log ρ∈VMO the ellipse W(S) is closed, while Wess(S) degenerates into the line interval

[formula]

We now turn to possible realizations of the outlined possibilities. If f admits a representation ([\ref=mini]) with θ of an infinite degree (that is, being an infinite Blaschke product or containing a non-trivial singular factor), then [formula] is the s-number of Hω having infinite multiplicity. In particular,

[formula]

According to Theorem [\ref=th:wc], W(S) in this case coincides with the closed ellipse Wess(S), all c-numerical ranges also are closed and differ from W(S) only by an appropriate scaling.

Now let θ in ([\ref=mini]) be a finite Blaschke product of degree b  (  ≥  0) while h is invertible in H2. Suppose also that [formula] does not satisfy Helson-Szeg condition, that is, cannot be represented in the form ([\ref=hs]) (such outer functions are easy to construct - take for example h with [formula] but [formula] for any ε > 0). Then the Toeplitz operator Tf has (b + 1)-dimensional kernel, dense (but not closed) range [\cite=LS], and therefore is not left Fredholm. By The kernel of the Toeplitz operator Tf coincides with the subspace on which the norm of Hf (= Hω) is attained and has dimension not less than b + 1 (> 0). By Coburn's lemma [\cite=Peller], the range of Tf is therefore dense. Suppose now in addition that [formula] does not satisfy Helson-Szeg condition, that is, cannot be represented in the form ([\ref=hs]), or equivalently ([\ref=feb31]) does not hold. The operator [formula] is then not Fredholm by Widom-Devinatz theorem [\cite=Peller]; the operator Tf is not Fredholm along with it. Due to the density of its range, it is actually not even left Fredholm, so that by Douglas-Sarason theorem [\cite=Peller]

[formula]

We conclude that ([\ref=eqh]) holds again. So, the ellipse W(S) is closed and coincides with Wess(S). According to Theorem [\ref=th:wc], the c-numerical range of S is closed if the number of coefficients cj of the same sign does not exceed b + 1, and open otherwise.

Finally, if a unimodular function ω is such that the operator Tω is invertible, ([\ref=eqh]) holds, but its minifunction is not constant a.e. in absolute value, then the norm of Hω is not attained. Accordingly, all c-numerical ranges, W(S) in particular, in this case are open.

A concrete realization of the latter possibility is given in the next subsection. All the other possibilities mentioned earlier also occur. To construct the respective weights ρ, the following procedure can be applied. Starting with any inner function θ and outer function h∈H2, choose f as in ([\ref=mini]) with [formula] changed to an arbitrary constant in (0,1). Let ω be an 1-canonical function of the Nehari problem corresponding to the Hankel operator Hf. As such, ω is unimodular, and can be represented as [formula], where g is an outer function in H2 [\cite=Peller]. Since [formula], the Toeplitz operator Tω- 1 is invertible [\cite=Peller] (the last two cited theorems from [\cite=Peller] are again by Adamyan-Arov-Krein [\cite=AAK681]). The desired weight is given by [formula].

By Treil's theorem [\cite=Peller], any positive semi-definite noninvertible operator with zero or infinite dimensional kernel is unitarily similar to the modulus of a Hankel operator. Thus, the multiplicity of the norm of Hω as its singular value can indeed assume any prescribed value, whether or not ([\ref=eqh]) holds.

Consider the concrete case of power weights

[formula]

It is an old and well known result that S is bounded on L2ρ with ρ given by ([\ref=pw]) if and only if [formula]. This fact, along with other results about such weights cited and used below (and established by Krupnik-Verbitskii [\cite=VerKru80]) can be found in the monograph [\cite=Kru87].

The essential norm of S does not depend on the distribution of the nodes tj along [formula], and equals

[formula]

In case of only one node (say t0, with the corresponding exponent β0), the norm of S is the same as ([\ref=sess]). The function ω constructed by this weight ρ in accordance with ([\ref=oh]) is simply ω(t) = tβ0, having a discontinuity at t0. The distance from ω to H∞ is the same as to H∞ + C, it equals [formula] and is attained on a constant [formula]. A corresponding minifunction [formula] is not constant a.e. in absolute value; thus, it cannot admit representation ([\ref=mini]). Consequently, the norm of Hω is not attained. Accordingly, Wc(S) is open for all c; the numerical range W(S) has the major axis of the length [formula]. Other c-numerical ranges are scaled by [formula], as usual.

More generally, the norm of S coincides with ([\ref=sess]) independently on the number of nodes, provided that one of the exponents (say β0) differs by its sign from all others and at the same time exceeds or equals their sum by absolute value. The size and the shape of all the ellipses W(S), Wess, Wc(S) is then the same as for the weight with only one exponent β0.

In case of two nodes (t1 and t2), the condition above holds if the respective exponents β1, β2 are of the opposite sign. If the signs are the same, the norm of S actually depends on arg t1 / t2. It takes its minimal value (for fixed βj) when t1 / t2 < 0. This value coincides with ([\ref=sess]), thus making Theorem [\ref=th:wc] applicable again.

Composition operators

For an analytic mapping of the unit disc [formula] into itself, the composition operator Cφ is defined as

[formula]

We consider this operator first on the Hardy space H2. In this setting, the operator Cφ is bounded and, if φ is an inner function,

[formula]

see [\cite=Nor68], also [\cite=CoClu95]. It is easily seen from the proof of ([\ref=cn]) given there that the norm of Cφ is not attained, unless φ(0) = 0. As was shown in [\cite=Sha87] [\cite=Sha00], the essential norm of Cφ coincides with its norm; moreover, this property is characteristic for inner functions.

The numerical ranges of composition operators Cφ with φ being conformal automorphisms of [formula] where treated in [\cite=BoSha00]. It was observed there, in particular, that W(Cφ) is an elliptical disc with the foci at ±  1 when Cφ is an involution, that is,

[formula]

for some fixed [formula]. The major axis of this disc Ep was computed in [\cite=Abd], where as a result of rather lengthy computations it was shown to equal [formula]. For p = 0, Cφ is an involution of norm 1. Respectively, E0 degenerates into the closed interval

[formula]

ψ(z)=(φ(z))=.

[formula]

These results, with some natural modifications, extend to the case of weighted spaces H2ρ. Namely, for a non-negative function [formula] with log ρ∈L1 we define the outer function ρ+ as in ([\ref=oh]). Then

[formula]

A change-of-variable argument, similar to that used in [\cite=Nor68], shows the following equality:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The norm of a multiplication operator on weighted and unweighted Hardy spaces is the same. According to ([\ref=intcomp]) the operator Cφ is therefore bounded on H2ρ if and only if

[formula]

Observe that ([\ref=boundcomp]) is equivalent to

[formula]

because φ is an involution. Apparently, ([\ref=boundcomp]) holds if ρ∈L∞ is bounded below from 0, but there are plenty of unbounded weights ρ satisfying ([\ref=boundcomp]) as well.

Under this condition, [formula], where

[formula]

For any ε > 0, consider a function g∈H2ρ with the norm one and such that [formula]. Then [formula] for gn(z) = zng(z), [formula]. Since the sequence gn converges weakly to zero in H2ρ, from here it follows that the essential norm of Cφ also equals M. (We use here the well-known fact that compact operators on Hilbert spaces map weakly convergent sequences into strongly convergent sequences, see [\cite=Riesz], for example.) Moreover, the norm of Cφ is attained if and only if there exist non-zero functions in H2ρ with absolute value equal zero a.e. on the subset of [formula] where [formula]. Due to uniqueness theorem for analytic functions, a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen is

[formula]

If ([\ref=att]) holds, then the norm is attained in particular on all inner functions, so that the respective subspace is infinitely dimensional. Consequently, Wess(Cφ) is the closed ellipse with the foci at ±  1 and the axes M  ±  M- 1, and W(Cφ) is the same ellipse when ([\ref=att]) holds or its interior when it does not. The c-numerical range is simply [formula].

Of course, for [formula] condition ([\ref=boundcomp]) holds, formula ([\ref=normcphi]) turns into ([\ref=cn]), and ([\ref=att]) is equivalent to p = 0. Thus, the results obtained match those already known in the unweighted setting.

One can also consider composition operators Cφ on weighted Lebesgue spaces L2ρ. Formula for the norm and the essential norm of Cφ remain exactly the same, with no changes in their derivation. Condition for the norm to be attained is different: in place of ([\ref=att]) it is required that the supremum in its left hand side is attained on a set of positive measure. The respective changes in the statement about the numerical ranges are evident, and we skip them. We note only that for [formula] the supremum in the right hand side of ([\ref=att]) either is attained everywhere (if p = 0) or just at one point (if p  ≠  0). Thus, all the sets W(Cφ), Wess(Cφ) and Wc(Cφ) are exactly the same whether the composition operator Cφ with the symbol ([\ref=jan311]) acts on H2 or L2.

The results concerning the numerical ranges of composition operators Cφ with φ given by ([\ref=jan311]) can be easily extended to the weighted spaces L2ρ. Let f∈L2ρ, where ρ is as in Subsection 3.2. A change-of-variable argument, similar to that used in [\cite=Nor68], shows the following equality:

[formula]

provided the integral on the right converges. Denoting

[formula]

we see from ([\ref=jan312]) that Cφ is bounded on L2ρ if and only if M <   ∞  , and in this case [formula]. It is also clear that the norm [formula] is attained if and only if

[formula]

on a set of positive measure. Note also that the essential norm of Cφ as an operator on L2ρ coincides with M. Indeed, for every ε > 0 and every [formula] there exists an orthonormal set [formula] in L2ρ such that the set [formula] is orthogonal in L2ρ and

[formula]

(Take f(m)ε,j to be appropriately scaled characteristic functions of subsets of

[formula]

Finally, we consider the operator Cφ on the Dirichlet space D. Recall that the latter is defined as the set of all analytic functions f on [formula] such that

[formula]

where dA is the area measure.

It was shown in [\cite=MV05] that for any univalent mapping φ of [formula] onto its subset of full measure,

[formula]

where L =  -  log (1 - |φ(0)|2). This simplifies to

[formula]

and is of course applicable when φ is given by ([\ref=jan311]). Consequently, the elliptical disc W(Cφ) has the major axis

[formula]

Moreover, the operators considered in [\cite=MV05] attain their norms, so that W(Cφ) is closed.

It was further observed in [\cite=H05] that the essential norm of Cφ on D does not exceed 1, for any univalent φ. For φ given by ([\ref=jan311]), the essential norm of Cφ on D must be equal 1, since the essential norm of an involution on an infinite dimensional space is at least one. Thus, Wess(Cφ) in this setting is the closed interval

[formula]
