Matrix units associated with the split basis of a Leonard pair

Kazumasa Nomura and Paul Terwilliger

Abstract

Let [formula] denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A:V  →  V and A*:V  →  V that satisfy (i), (ii) below:

There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A* is diagonal.

There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.

We call such a pair a Leonard pair on V. It is known that there exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is lower bidiagonal and the matrix representing A* is upper bidiagonal. In this paper we give some formulae involving the matrix units associated with this basis.

Leonard pairs and Leonard systems

We begin by recalling the notion of a Leonard pair. We will use the following terms. A square matrix X is said to be tridiagonal whenever each nonzero entry lies on either the diagonal, the subdiagonal, or the superdiagonal. Assume X is tridiagonal. Then X is said to be irreducible whenever each entry on the subdiagonal is nonzero and each entry on the superdiagonal is nonzero. We now define a Leonard pair. For the rest of this paper [formula] will denote a field.

[\cite=T:Leonard] Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. By a Leonard pair on V we mean an ordered pair (A,A*), where A:V  →  V and A*:V  →  V are linear transformations that satisfy (i), (ii) below:

There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A* is diagonal.

There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.

It is a common notational convention to use A* to represent the conjugate-transpose of A. We are not using this convention. In a Leonard pair (A,A*) the linear transformations A and A* are arbitrary subject to (i) and (ii) above.

We refer the reader to [\cite=H], [\cite=N:aw], [\cite=NT:balanced], [\cite=NT:formula], [\cite=NT:det], [\cite=P], [\cite=T:sub1], [\cite=T:sub3], [\cite=T:Leonard], [\cite=T:24points], [\cite=T:conform], [\cite=T:intro], [\cite=T:intro2], [\cite=T:split], [\cite=T:array], [\cite=T:qRacah], [\cite=T:survey], [\cite=TV], [\cite=V] for background on Leonard pairs. We especially recommend the survey [\cite=T:survey]. See [\cite=AC], [\cite=AC2], [\cite=ITT], [\cite=IT:shape], [\cite=IT:uqsl2hat], [\cite=IT:non-nilpotent], [\cite=ITW:equitable], [\cite=N:refine], [\cite=N:height1], [\cite=T:qSerre], [\cite=T:Kac-Moody] for related topics.

It is known that there exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is lower bidiagonal and the matrix representing A* is upper bidiagonal [\cite=T:Leonard]. In this paper we give some formulae involving the matrix units associated with this basis. We also display some related formulae involving the primitive idempotents of A and A*, which might be of independent interest.

When working with a Leonard pair, it is convenient to consider a closely related object called a Leonard system. To prepare for our definition of a Leonard system, we recall a few concepts from linear algebra. Let d denote a nonnegative integer and let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of all d + 1 by d + 1 matrices that have entries in [formula]. We index the rows and columns by [formula]. For the rest of this paper we let A denote a [formula]-algebra isomorphic to [formula]. Let V denote a simple A-module. We remark that V is unique up to isomorphism of A-modules, and that V has dimension d + 1. Let [formula] denote a basis for V. For X∈A and [formula], we say Y represents X with respect to [formula] whenever [formula] for 0  ≤  j  ≤  d. For A∈A we say A is multiplicity-free whenever it has d + 1 mutually distinct eigenvalues in [formula]. Assume A is multiplicity-free. Let [formula] denote an ordering of the eigenvalues of A, and for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d put

[formula]

where I denotes the identity of A. We observe (i) AEi  =  θiEi (0  ≤  i  ≤  d); (ii) EiEj  =  δi,jEi (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d); (iii) [formula]; (iv) [formula]. We call Ei the primitive idempotent of A associated with θi.

By a Leonard pair in A we mean an ordered pair of elements in A that act on V as a Leonard pair in the sense of Definition [\ref=def:LP]. We now define a Leonard system.

[\cite=T:Leonard] By a Leonard system in A we mean a sequence

[formula]

that satisfies (i)-(v) below.

Each of A, A* is a multiplicity-free element in A.

[formula] is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A.

[formula] is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A*.

For 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d,

[formula]

For 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d,

[formula]

Leonard systems are related to Leonard pairs as follows. Let (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a Leonard system in A. Then (A,A*) is a Leonard pair in A [\cite=T:qRacah]. Conversely, suppose (A,A*) is a Leonard pair in A. Then each of A,A* is multiplicity-free [\cite=T:Leonard]. Moreover there exists an ordering [formula] of the primitive idempotents of A, and there exists an ordering [formula] of the primitive idempotents of A*, such that (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) is a Leonard system in A [\cite=T:qRacah].

The D4 action

For the rest of this paper, let

[formula]

denote a Leonard system in A.

Observe that each of the following is a Leonard system in A:

[formula]

Viewing *  , [formula], [formula] as permutations on the set of all Leonard systems in A,

[formula]

[formula]

The group generated by symbols *  , [formula], [formula] subject to the relations ([\ref=eq:relation1]), ([\ref=eq:relation2]) is the dihedral group D4. We recall D4 is the group of symmetries of a square, and has 8 elements. Apparently *  , [formula], [formula] induce an action of D4 on the set of all Leonard systems in A. Two Leonard systems will be called relatives whenever they are in the same orbit of this D4 action. The relatives of Φ are as follows:

We will use the following notational convention.

For g∈D4 and for an object f associated with Φ we let fg denote the corresponding object associated with Φg- 1.

The antiautomorphism [formula]

Associated with the Leonard system Φ, there is a certain antiautomorphism of A denoted by [formula] and defined as follows. Recall that an antiautomorphism of A is a map γ:A  →  A which is an isomorphism of [formula]-vector spaces and (XY)γ = YγXγ for all X,Y∈A.

[\cite=T:qRacah] Referring to the Leonard system Φ, there exists a unique antiautomorphism [formula] of A such that [formula] and [formula]. Moreover [formula] for all X∈A and

[formula]

The parameter array

In this section we recall some parameters associated with the Leonard system Φ.

Referring to the Leonard system Φ, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d let θi denote the eigenvalue of A associated with Ei, and let θ*i denote the eigenvalue of A* associated with E*i. We call [formula] the eigenvalue sequence of Φ, and [formula] the dual eigenvalue sequence of Φ.

Let V denote a simple A-module. By a decomposition of V we mean a sequence consisting of 1-dimensional subspaces of V whose direct sum is V. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d we define

[formula]

By [\cite=T:survey] the sequence [formula] is a decomposition of V. We call this the Φ-split decomposition of V. By [\cite=T:survey] we have

[formula]

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=eq:AUi]), ([\ref=eq:AsUi]) we find that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d the space Ui is an eigenspace for (A - θi - 1I)(A*  -  θ*iI), and the corresponding eigenvalue is nonzero. We denote this eigenvalue by φi. We call the sequence [formula] the first split sequence of Φ. The first split sequence of [formula] is denoted by [formula], and called the second split sequence of Φ. We emphasize that φi  ≠  0, φi  ≠  0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d.

By the parameter array of Φ we mean the sequence

[formula]

where [formula] (resp. [formula]) denotes the eigenvalue sequence (resp. dual eigenvalue sequence) of Φ, and [formula] (resp. [formula]) denotes the first split sequence (resp. second split sequence) of Φ.

The D4 action affects the parameter array as follows.

[\cite=T:Leonard] Referring to the Leonard system Φ, the following (i)-(iii) hold.

The parameter array of Φ* is

[formula]

The parameter array of [formula] is

The parameter array of [formula] is

Some formulae

In this section we prove some formulae which we will find useful. We use the following notation.

Let λ denote an indeterminate and let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of all polynomials in λ that have coefficients in [formula]. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d let τi, ηi, τ*i, η*i denote the following polynomials in [formula]:

[formula]

We observe that each of τi, ηi, τ*i, η*i is monic of degree i.

Referring to the Leonard system Φ, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d we have

[formula]

We first prove ([\ref=eq:relD]). Let i be given and define

[formula]

We show HEd = 0. To this end we let V denote a simple A-module and show HEdV = 0. By ([\ref=eq:defEi]) we have

[formula]

Using this we find that H is equal to

[formula]

times

[formula]

Setting i = d in ([\ref=eq:defUi]) we find EdV = Ud. Recursively using ([\ref=eq:AsUi]) we find

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:AUi]), ([\ref=eq:AsUi]) and the definition of φi, we find that ([\ref=eq:relaux1]) vanishes on Ui. By these comments we find HEdV = 0 as desired. Thus ([\ref=eq:relD]) holds. To obtain the remaining equations apply D4 and use Lemma [\ref=lem:D4].

Applying the antiautomorphism [formula] to ([\ref=eq:rel1])-([\ref=eq:reldDs]) we routinely obtain the following result.

Referring to the Leonard system Φ, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d we have

[formula]

To obtain further formulae concerning Φ we need the following general lemma.

Let [formula] denote a sequence of mutually distinct scalars in [formula]. Then for an indeterminate λ,

[formula]

We will use induction on d. Assume d  ≥  1; otherwise the result is trivial. The left side of ([\ref=eq:aux]) is equal to

[formula]

and this is equal to the right side of ([\ref=eq:aux]).

The following hold.

[formula]

[formula]

In ([\ref=eq:aux]) we set ξi  =  θi for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d and multiply both sides by ηd(θ0); this gives the equation on the right in ([\ref=eq:transetad]). To obtain the remaining equations apply D4 and use Lemma [\ref=lem:D4].

Referring to the Leonard system Φ, the following hold.

[formula]

We first prove ([\ref=eq:E0EsdEdEs0]). From ([\ref=eq:defEi]) we have

[formula]

In this equation we evaluate τd(A) using the equation on the left in ([\ref=eq:transetad]) to get

[formula]

In this equation we multiply each term on the left by E0E*d and on the right by E*0; the result is

[formula]

In this equation we evaluate each term E0E*dηi(A) using ([\ref=eq:reldanti]); we find E0E*dEdE*0 is equal to

[formula]

times

[formula]

We show ([\ref=eq:E0EsdEdEs0aux]) is equal to E0E*0. Recall A*E*0  =  θ*0E*0, so τ*j(A*)E*0  =  τ*j(θ*0)E*0 for 0  ≤  j  ≤  d. Also τ*j(θ*0) is equal to 1 for j = 0 and 0 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d. Combining these comments we find τ*j(A*)E*0  =  δ0,jE*0 for 0  ≤  j  ≤  d. Evaluating ([\ref=eq:E0EsdEdEs0aux]) using this we find it is equal to E0E*0. Thus ([\ref=eq:E0EsdEdEs0]) holds. To obtain the remaining equations apply D4 and use Lemma [\ref=lem:D4].

The Φ-split basis

Let V denote a simple A-module. In this section we associate with Φ a certain basis for V, and we consider the action of A on this basis.

Consider the decomposition [formula] from ([\ref=eq:defUi]). For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d let ui denote a nonzero vector in Ui, and observe [formula] is a basis for V. In view of ([\ref=eq:AUi]) we normalize this basis so that

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:AsUi]), ([\ref=eq:Aui]) and the definition of φi, we find

[formula]

We call [formula] the Φ-split basis for V. The Φ-split basis is unique up to multiplication of each basis vector by the same nonzero scalar in [formula].

For X∈A, let [formula] denote the matrix in [formula] that represents X with respect to the Φ-split basis. We observe [formula] is an isomorphism of [formula]-algebras.

We have

[formula]

Immediate from ([\ref=eq:Aui]), ([\ref=eq:Asui]).

Referring to Definition [\ref=def:natural], for 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d let Δi,j denote the element of A such that [formula] has (i,j)-entry 1 and all other entries 0.

We have a comment.

Referring to Definition [\ref=def:Delta], the [formula]-vector space A has basis

[formula]

Moreover

[formula]

We are going to give some formulae for the Δi,j. We will use the following notation. Recall by [\cite=T:qRacah] that the trace of E*0E0 is nonzero; let ν denote the multiplicative inverse of this trace, so that

[formula]

By [\cite=T:qRacah] we have

[formula]

Applying D4 to ([\ref=eq:nu]) and using Lemma [\ref=lem:D4] we find

[formula]

Referring to Definition [\ref=def:Delta], Δi,j is equal to each of

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d.

We first prove that Δi,j is equal to the expression on the left in ([\ref=eq:Deltaij]). Let V denote a simple A-module and let [formula] denote a Φ-split basis for V. By Definition [\ref=def:Delta] it suffices to show

[formula]

By a routine induction using ([\ref=eq:Asui]) we find that, when we write τ*j(A*)uk as a linear combination of [formula], the coefficient of u0 is [formula]. We claim that

[formula]

To prove ([\ref=eq:mainaux2]) we consider the matrix [formula]. For 1  ≤  r  ≤  d, column r of [formula] is zero since E0ur  =  0 by ([\ref=eq:defUi]). For 1  ≤  s  ≤  d, row s of [formula] is zero since E*0V  =  U0 and since u0 is a basis for U0. Apparently the (0,0)-entry of [formula] is equal to the trace of E*0E0 or in other words ν- 1. Line ([\ref=eq:mainaux2]) follows and the claim is proved. From ([\ref=eq:Aui]) we find τi(A)u0  =  ui. By these commments we routinely obtain ([\ref=eq:mainaux1]). We have now shown that Δi,j is equal to the expression on the left in ([\ref=eq:Deltaij]).

Next we prove that Δi,j is equal to the expression on the right in ([\ref=eq:Deltaij]). In the expression on the left in ([\ref=eq:Deltaij]) we evaluate τi(A)E*0 using ([\ref=eq:relds]) and evaluate E0τ*j(A*) using ([\ref=eq:reldanti]); the result is

[formula]

In this equation we evaluate EdE*0E0E*d using ([\ref=eq:EdEs0E0Esd]); the result is

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:nu]) and ([\ref=eq:nu2]),

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq:aux1]), ([\ref=eq:aux2]) we find that Δi,j is equal to the expression on the right in ([\ref=eq:Deltaij]).

The primitive idempotents associated with the Φ-split decomposition

In this section we consider the following elements in A.

Referring to Definition [\ref=def:Delta], we define

[formula]

We have two comments.

Let V denote a simple A-module. Then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, Fi satisfies

[formula]

[formula]

In other words Fi is the projection from V onto Ui.

The following (i)-(iii) hold.

FiFj  =  δi,jFi (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d).

[formula].

Each of [formula] has rank 1.

For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, Fi is equal to each of

[formula]

Combine Definition [\ref=def:Fi] and Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Some formulae for the split sequences

In this section we give some formulae for the first and second split sequences of Φ in terms of Fi, F*i, [formula], [formula]. We start with a lemma.

For 0  ≤  k  ≤  d,

[formula]

where φ0 = 0 and φd + 1 = 0.

The left side of ([\ref=eq:comFk]) is equal to the trace of [formula]. By Definition [\ref=def:Fi], [formula] has (k,k)-entry 1 and all other entries 0. Using this we find that for [formula], the trace of [formula] is equal to the (k,k)-entry of B. By Example [\ref=exm:AAs] the (k,k)-entry of [formula] is equal to φk  -  φk + 1. By these comments we obtain ([\ref=eq:comFk]).

We now come to our final theorem.

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, φi is equal to each of

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover φi is equal to each of

[formula]

[formula]

Referring to the first displayed line of the theorem, we find φi is equal to the expression on the left (resp. right) by summing ([\ref=eq:comFk]) over [formula] (resp. [formula]). To obtain the remaining equations apply D4 and use Lemma [\ref=lem:D4].
