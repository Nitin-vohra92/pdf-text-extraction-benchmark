Higher Fano manifolds and rational surfaces

Introduction

One consequence of the bend-and-break lemma is uniruledness of Fano manifolds,  [\cite=Miyaoka-Mori86]. In fact, in characteristic 0, Fano manifolds are rationally connected,  [\cite=KMM92c],  [\cite=Ca]. We prove an analogous theorem with rational curves replaced by rational surfaces for Fano manifolds satisfying positivity of the second graded piece of the Chern character.

A Fano manifold is 2-Fano if [formula] is nef, where [formula] is the second graded piece of the Chern character, [formula]. In other words, [formula] is nonnegative for every surface S in X.

Let [formula] be a positive-dimensional, irreducible component of the Artin stack [formula] of genus 0 stable maps to X whose general point of [formula] parametrizes a stable map with irreducible domain. Denote by M the coarse moduli space of M. Denote by Δ the locally principal closed substack of [formula] parametrizing stable maps with reducible domain. The closed substack Δ is a Cartier divisor. The question we consider is uniruledness of M.

If X is 2-Fano, every point of M parametrizing a free curve and contained in a proper curve in [formula] is contained in a rational curve in M.

If a general point of M parametrizes a birational, free curve and is contained in a proper curve in [formula], then a general point of X is contained in a rational surface.

The proof uses the bend-and-break approach of  [\cite=Miyaoka-Mori86]. Given a general curve C in M, we need to bound the dimension of [formula] from below. Although M and [formula] may be very singular, the deformation theory of stable maps nonetheless gives a useful lower bound. This uses Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch computations from  [\cite=dJS3]. Unfortunately, the formula has a negative term coming from intersection points of C and Δ. This is the reason for the hypothesis that [formula] contains a proper curve. Luckily, there are nice sufficient conditions for [formula] to contain many proper curves.

If the pseudo-index of X is ≥  3 and every irreducible component of Δ is an irreducible component of Δ, then [formula] is a union of proper curves.

This uses a contraction of the locally principal closed subspace Δ in [formula] discovered in  [\cite=CHS1] and independently by Adam Parker  [\cite=Parker].

Section  [\ref=sec-ex] gives some examples of 2-Fano manifolds and makes some observations about classification. Section  [\ref=sec-sharp] shows Theorem  [\ref=thm-main] is sharp in 2 ways. First, there are Fano manifolds that are not 2-Fano where the components [formula] are not uniruled. Second, there are 2-Fano manifolds where the components [formula] are uniruled but not rationally connected. Finally Section  [\ref=sec-spec] speculates on sufficient conditions for the components [formula] to be rationally connected.

Proof of the theorem

For every point x, denote by [formula] the open subscheme of [formula] parametrizing nonconstant morphisms.

The dimension of every irreducible component of [formula] is at least as large as the pseudo-index of X.

This follows from  [\cite=K].

Let [formula] be a plurianticanonical embedding. Denote by [formula] the associated embedding. Denote by [formula] the contraction of the boundary constructed in  [\cite=CHS1]. Denote by N the image of [formula] in Y.

Since the restriction of φ to [formula] is an open immersion, the restriction of [formula] to Δ is and immersion. Since [formula] is dense in [formula], [formula] has pure dimension equal to the expected dimension, and Δ is a Cartier divisor. Therefore [formula] equals [formula] and [formula] equals [formula].

If i  ≤  j, the restriction of φ to the boundary divisor Δi,j factors through the projection [formula]. Denote [formula] by ΔX,i,j. Denote the restriction of πj by [formula]. By Lemma  [\ref=lem-1], every irreducible component of every fiber of πX,j has dimension ≥  1, i.e., the difference of the pseudo-index and [formula]. Therefore, for every irreducible component Δ' of Δ, the dimension of [formula] is strictly less than the dimension of Δ'. By hypothesis, every irreducible component Δ' of Δ is an irreducible component of Δ. Since [formula] equals [formula], the image of Δ' in N has dimension [formula].

Since every connected component of Y is projective, also N is projective. Because [formula], a general intersection of N with [formula] hyperplanes containing a point of [formula] is a complete curve that does not intersect [formula]. Because there are only finitely many irreducible components of Δ, a general intersection of N with [formula] hyperplanes containing a point of [formula] is a complete curve that does not intersect [formula]. The inverse image of this curve in Δ is a complete curve containing a given point of Δ.

Let C be a smooth, proper, connected curve and let [formula] be a nonconstant 1-morphism whose general point parametrizes a free curve of ( - KX)-degree e. Let B be a finite set of closed points of C. Denote by (π:Σ  →  C,F:Σ  →  X) the associated family of stable maps.

((T)|) + (c(T)|) + (e+(X)-3)(1-g(C)-#(B)).

[formula]

Consider the finite morphism (π,g):Σ  →  C  ×  X. Denote by [formula] the cokernel of the map,

[formula]

By a natural generalization of  [\cite=K], the dimension of [formula] at ζ is at least,

[formula]

By the Leray spectral sequence, h2(Σ, equals h1(C,R1π*. Because a general point of C parametrizes a free curve, the restriction of [formula] to a general fiber of π is generated by global sections, thus has no higher cohomology. Thus R1π* is a torsion sheaf so that h1(C,R1π* is 0. Therefore, the lower bound actually equals χ(Σ,.

Finally, by the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch computations from  [\cite=dJS3], χ(Σ, equals,

[formula]

Every proper curve in [formula] is the image of a nonconstant 1-morphism ζ:C  →  Δ from a smooth curve C. The induced morphism [formula] is finite. By Lemma [\ref=lem-3], [formula] behaves as if M is smooth along the image of ζ and the anticanonical degree of ζ(C) equals

[formula]

Because X is 2-Fano, this degree is positive. Therefore the usual bend-and-break argument applies, cf.  [\cite=K].

Examples of 2-Fano manifolds

All the results of this section, and more, are discussed and proved in the note  [\cite=dJS6]. There are a two families of 2-Fano manifolds. The first family comes from complete intersections. Let [formula] be a weighted projective space of dimension n. Let [formula] be a smooth complete intersection of type [formula]. Then X is Fano if and only if [formula]. It is 2-Fano if and only if [formula].

The second family comes from Grassmannians. Let [formula] be a Grassmannian [formula] of k-dimensional subspaces of a fixed n-dimensional vector space. Without loss of generality, assume n  ≥  2k. This is Fano. It is 2-Fano if and only if either k = 1, n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.

There are two operations for producing new 2-Fano manifolds. First, if X and Y are each 2-Fano, then the product X  ×  Y is 2-Fano. The second operation is more interesting. Let X be a smooth Fano manifold and let L be a nef invertible sheaf. The [formula]-bundle [formula] is Fano if and only if c1(TX) - c1(L) is ample. Assuming it is Fano, it is 2-Fano if and only if [formula] is nef. Notice, it is not necessary that [formula] is nef, i.e., X need not be 2-Fano.

There are other operations on Fano manifolds. It is reasonable to ask which of these produce 2-Fano manifolds. For instance, a projective bundle [formula] of fiber dimension ≥  2 over a Fano manifold is also Fano if E satisfies a weak version of stability. However, if [formula] is 2-Fano then the pullback of E to every curve is a semistable bundle. If X is [formula], for instance, this implies [formula] is simply [formula]. This, and other examples, suggest the following principle: an operation on Fano manifolds produces a 2-Fano manifold only if some vector bundle associated to the operation is semistable.

The theorem is sharp

The theorem is sharp in 2 ways. First, let X be a general cubic hypersurface in [formula]. This is Fano, but it is not 2-Fano. By the main theorem of  [\cite=dJS2], there are infinitely many non-uniruled irreducible components [formula] of [formula] satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem  [\ref=thm-main].

Second, let Y be the [formula]-bundle over X, [formula]. By the construction in the last section, Y is 2-Fano. Associated to the projection π:Y  →  X, there is a 1-morphism [formula]. For an irreducible component [formula] of [formula] containing a free curve, it is easy to prove the boundary Δ is contracted. (However it is not true that every component of Δ is a component of Δ.) Thus Theorem  [\ref=thm-main] implies N is uniruled. In fact, the restriction of [formula] to [formula] is birational to a projective bundle over the image component [formula] of [formula]. Choosing [formula] appropriately, [formula] is one of the infinitely many non-uniruled irreducible components of [formula]. Therefore N is not rationally connected, and the MRC quotient of N is precisely M.

Speculation

For the counterexample Y in the previous section, [formula] is nef. But it is not "positive". It has intersection number 0 with the surface π- 1(B) for every curve B in X. If X is a Fano manifold such that [formula] has positive intersection number with every surface, is [formula] rationally connected? We know no counterexample.
