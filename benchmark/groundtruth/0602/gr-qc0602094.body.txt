Some Aspects of Virtual Black Holes

Introducation:-

It is expected that space-time will have quantum fluctuations in it

[formula]

. Thus space-time get a foam like structure near Planck length. This is called space-time foam

[formula]

. In it we took space-time to be multiple connected. So we took the space-time manifold to have a large value of first Betti number B1. We took B2 = 0 in this case

[formula]

. Macroscopic wormholes also led to the wrong value of the black hole entropy

[formula]

. In it we take B1  =  B3  =  0 and we also take a very large value of second Betti number B2. Thus the space-time manifold is simple connected in this case. Quantum bubble picture predicted the correct value of Q.C.D. θ-parameter. In this picture there is also an elegant way to describe black hole evaporation. Macroscopic real black holes evaporate down to Planck size by radiating Hawking radiation. At this stage they are left with no energy or charge. Then they disappear in a sea of virtual black holes. Thus this picture seems to be a more realistic picture of space-time foam. In this paper we will analyze some aspects of quantum bubble picture. We will start this paper by reviving the basic bubbles that are used in the construction of space-time foam.

Basic Quantum Bubbles

There are five basic bubbles that can be taken to be the building blocks of space-time foam i.e., [formula]. However the need of space-time to have a spin structure rules out CP2 and [formula] and the contributions of K3 and [formula] are suppressed by Atiyah-Singer theorem as they contain Fermions zero mode

[formula]

. This is similar to the pair creation in ordinary particle physics. Now as the quantum bubbles are basically quantum fluctuations in the metric, so we can interpit the bubble with topology S2  ×  S2  -  {p} as a virtual black hole loop. Here we deform the loop on which the black hole moves into an oval with bottom representing the creation and top representing the annihilation of a pair of black holes.

Virtual Black Holes

We need electric or magnetic charges to produce a pair of black holes from Ernst solution. However the quantum bubbles form even in absence of any field. The reason for that is that virtual black holes are not classical geometries and hence need not satisfy Einsteins equations. They are rather solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The solution of Wheeler-DeWitt equation is a wave function on space of geometries . Wheeler-DeWitt equation is given by

[formula]

. So this particle will be radiated as a combination of some other particles before the annihilation of the pair of virtual black holes. This will cause loss of information to take place universally in space-time as an intrinsic property of space-time.

Loss of Quantum Coherence

It is well known that in case of real black holes the falling of certain states in the black hole leads to non-unitary evolution and hence loss of quantum coherence. A similar effect happens for the virtual black holes. There is an elegant formalism called the Superscattering formalism given by S.W.Hawking to describe it

[formula]

. Apart from the simple two well known topological invariants in quantum gravity i.e., the signature and Eulers number of the space-time manifold there is another topological invariant in quantum gravity which is called the topological invariant volume. The total action [formula] for space-time manifold is given by

[formula]

Here Lp is the Planck length and Vol(M,g) is the volume of the manifold and Λ is the cosmological constant. If we redefine the metric as follows:-

[formula]

Then the action becomes

[formula]

Here [formula] is the topological invariant volume. We can also write the partition function in terms of [formula] as follows:-

[formula]

Here [formula] is the measure of density of topology. Now we can see how much quantum coherence is lost for a given topological invariant volume. If the total flux of wave function that enters [formula] is Γ1 and the total flux that leaves [formula] is Γ2, then the total information lost in [formula] is [formula] and it is given by

[formula]

Now as the amplitude for formation of a virtual black hole is α, we can write

[formula]

Now we can write Γ2 in terms of Γ1 as follows

[formula]

It is obvious that if no quantum coherence is lost than Γ1  =  Γ2 as τ = 0 in this case.

Entropy of Space-time

The fact that virtual black hole picture make the space-time to have an intrinsic entropy can be seen in various ways. The fact that it lead to a mixed state will imply that the space-time has an entropy given by

[formula]

This will be zero for a pure state when no quantum coherence is lost.

Another way of looking at the intrinsic entropy of space-time is by observing that the fact that space-time gets a coarse structure at Planck length due to the presence of virtual black holes. As here different microstates will lead to the same macrostate i.e., the smooth space-time manifold at length much larger than Planck length, so space-time will have an intrinsic entropy. Here the intrinsic entropy of space-time will be given by

[formula]

Here W is the number of microstates generate by the virtual black holes and k is the Boltzmanns constant.

But probable the best way to look at the intrinsic entropy of space-time generate by virtual black holes is by black hole thermodynamics. It is well known that real black holes have entropy proportional to one fourth of the surface area of the event horizon

[formula]

.

[formula]

Here Δg are the fluctuations in the metric and L is the length at which we measure the geometry. Thus at Planck length the quantum fluctuations in geometry become of order one. So it is not possible to define geometries less than Planck length. However if we assume the radius of virtual black holes to be less than the Planck length that is what we will be implying. So the virtual black holes can not have radius less than the Planck length. Thus the radius of the virtual black holes should be taken equal to Planck length. So we can write the area of the quantum bubble with topology S2  ×  S2  -  {p} as follows:-

[formula]

Thus we can write the intrinsic entropy of space-time per topological invariant volume as follows:-

[formula]

This is the intrinsic entropy of space-time calculated from black hole thermodynamics. Thus it can be shown in more than one way that virtual black holes will lead space-time to have an intrinsic entropy.

Conclusion

Quantum bubble picture seems to be the more correct picture of space-time foam as compaired to the wormhole picture. The bubble of topology S2  ×  S2  -  {p} is the building block of space-time and is representative of virtual black hole loop. Virtual black holes are solutions to Wheeler-DeWitt equation and hence need not have any electric or magnetic charges as would be required if they satisfied Einstein equations. Virtual black holes lead to the loss of quantum coherence, which we have calculated in this paper. Virtual black holes also lead the space-time to have an intrinsic entropy.
