Introduction

In [\cite=alliancesOne], P. Kristiansen, S. M. Hedetniemi and S. T. Hedetniemi introduced several types of alliances in graphs, including defensive and offensive alliances. We are interested in a generalization of alliances, namely k-alliances, given by Shafique and Dutton [\cite=kdaf]. In this paper we show several mathematical properties of k-alliance free sets and k-alliance cover sets.

We begin by stating some notation and terminology. In this paper Γ = (V,E) denotes a simple graph of order n, size m, minimum degree δ and maximum degree Δ. For a non-empty subset S  ⊆  V, and any vertex v∈V, we denote by NS(v) the set of neighbors v has in S: NS(v): = {u∈S:u  ~  v} and δS(v)  =  |NS(v)| denotes the degree of v in S. The complement of the set S in V is denoted by [formula]. The boundary of a set S  ⊆  V is defined as [formula] A nonempty set of vertices S  ⊆  V is called a defensive (offensive) k- alliance in Γ if for every v∈S (v∈∂S), [formula]. Hereafter, if there is no restriction on the values of k, we assume that k∈{  -  Δ,...,Δ}. Notice that any vertex subset is an offensive k-alliance for k∈{  -  Δ,1 - Δ,2 - Δ}.

A set X  ⊆  V is defensive (offensive) k-alliance free, k-daf (k-oaf), if for all defensive (offensive) k-alliance S, [formula], i.e., X does not contain any defensive (offensive) k-alliance as a subset [\cite=kdaf] [\cite=shafique]. A defensive (offensive) k-alliance free set X is maximal if for every defensive (offensive) k-alliance free set Y, [formula]. A maximum k-daf (k-oaf) set is a maximal (k-oaf) k-daf set of largest cardinality.

A set Y  ⊆  V is a defensive (offensive) k-alliance cover, k-dac (k-oac), if for all defensive (offensive) k-alliances S, [formula], i.e., Y contains at least one vertex from each defensive (offensive) k-alliance of Γ. A k-dac (k-oac) set Y is minimal if no proper subset of Y is a defensive (offensive) k-alliance cover set. A minimum k-dac (k-oac) set is a minimal cover set of smallest cardinality.

If X is a minimal k-dac (k-oac) set then, for all v∈X, there exists a defensive (offensive) k-alliance Sv for which [formula].

If X is a maximal k-daf (k-oaf) set, then, for all [formula], there exists Sv  ⊆  X such that [formula] is a defensive (offensive) k-alliance.

A defensive (offensive) k-alliance is global if it is a dominating set. For short, in the case of a global offensive k-alliance cover (free) set we will write k-goac (k-goaf).

Associated with the characteristic sets defined above we have the following invariants:

ak(Γ): minimum cardinality of a defensive k-alliance in Γ.

γk(Γ): minimum cardinality of a global defensive k-alliance in Γ.

γok(Γ): minimum cardinality of a global offensive k-alliance in Γ.

φk(Γ): cardinality of a maximum k-daf set in Γ.

φok(Γ): cardinality of a maximum k-oaf set in Γ.

φgok(Γ): cardinality of a maximum k-goaf set in Γ.

ζk(Γ): cardinality of a minimum k-dac set in Γ.

ζok(Γ): cardinality of a minimum k-oac set in Γ.

ζgok(Γ): cardinality of a minimum k-goac set in Γ.

The following duality between alliance cover and alliance free sets was shown in [\cite=kdaf] [\cite=shafique].

X is a defensive (offensive) k-alliance cover set if and only if [formula] is defensive (offensive) k-alliance free.

φk(Γ) + ζk(Γ) = φok(Γ) + ζok(Γ) = n.

Alliance cover and alliance free sets

We begin by studying the structure of a set according to the structure of its complementary set.

If X is a minimal k-dac set, then [formula] is a dominating set.

By Remark [\ref=thDual], if X is a minimal k-dac set, then [formula] is a maximal k-daf set. Therefore, for all v∈X, there exists [formula] such that [formula] is a defensive k-alliance. So, for every u∈Xv, [formula] On the other hand, as Xv is not a defensive k-alliance, there exists w∈Xv such that [formula]. Hence, by the above inequalities, [formula] Thus, 2δ{v}(w) > 0 and, as a consequence, v is adjacent to w.

Notice that there exist minimal k-oac sets such that their complement sets are not dominating sets. For instance we consider the graph obtained from the cycle graph C8 by adding the edge {v1,v3} and the edge {v5,v7}. In this graph the set S = {v2,v3,v5,v6,v7} is a minimal 0-oac but S̄ is not a dominating set.

If X is a minimal k-dac set, then [formula] is a global offensive k-alliance.

If X  ⊂  V is a minimal k-dac set, then for every v∈X there exists a defensive k-alliance Sv such that [formula]. Hence, [formula] and [formula] Therefore, for every v∈X, we have [formula]. On the other hand, by Theorem [\ref=lemmaDominating], [formula] is a dominating set. In consequence, [formula] is a global offensive k-alliance in Γ.

φk(Γ)  ≥  γok(Γ) and ζk(Γ)  ≤  n - γok(Γ).

Notice that if one vertex v∈V belongs to any offensive k-alliance, then [formula] is a k-oaf set. Hence, δ(v) < k. So, if k  ≤  δ and X is a minimal k-oac set, then |X|  ≥  2.

For every k∈{2 - Δ,...,Δ}, if X is a minimal k-goac set such that |X|  ≥  2, then [formula] is an offensive (k - 2)-alliance. Moreover, if k∈{3,...,Δ}, then [formula] is a global offensive (k - 2)-alliance.

If X  ⊂  V is a minimal k-goac set, then for all v∈X there exists a global offensive k-alliance, Sv, such that [formula]. Hence, [formula] for every [formula]. As [formula], we have [formula] for every [formula]. Therefore, [formula] is an offensive (k - 2)-alliance. Moreover, if k > 2, [formula] is a dominating set. So, in such a case, it is a global offensive (k - 2)-alliance.

For every k∈{3,...,δ}, φgok(Γ)  ≥  γok - 2(Γ) and ζgok(Γ)  ≤  n - γok - 2(Γ).

For every k∈{1 - Δ,...,Δ - 1},

if X is a global offensive k-alliance, then [formula] is (1 - k)-daf;

if X is a defensive k-alliance, then [formula] is (1 - k)-goaf.

(i) If X is a global offensive k-alliance, then for every [formula] we have [formula]. Hence, the set [formula] is not a defensive (1 - k)-alliance. Moreover, if [formula], then for every y∈Y we have [formula]. Thus, the set Y is not a defensive (1 - k)-alliance. Therefore, [formula] is a (1 - k)-daf set.

(ii) If X is a defensive k-alliance, then for every v∈X we have [formula]. So, [formula] is not a global offensive (1 - k)-alliance. Moreover, for every [formula] and [formula] it is satisfied [formula], in consequence, S is not a global offensive (1 - k)-alliance.

For every k∈{1 - Δ,...,Δ - 1},

ζ1 - k(Γ)  ≤  γok(Γ) and φ1 - k(Γ)  ≥  n - γok(Γ);

ζgo1 - k(Γ)  ≤  ak(Γ).

Notice that all equalities in the above corollaries are attained for the complete graph of order n where [formula] and [formula].

As we show in the following table, by combining some of the above results we can deduce basic properties on alliance free sets and alliance cover sets. For the restrictions on k, see the premises of the corresponding results.

Monotony of φgok(Γ) and φk(Γ)

If X is a k-goaf set, k∈{1,...,Δ - 2}, such that |X|  ≤  n - 2, then there exists [formula] such that [formula] is a (k + 2)-goaf set.

Let us suppose that for every [formula], [formula] is not a (k + 2)-goaf set. Let [formula] and let Sv  ⊂  X, such that [formula] is a global offensive (k + 2)-alliance in Γ. Then for every [formula] we have [formula] So, for every [formula], [formula] Now we take a vertex [formula] and by the above procedure, taking the vertex w instead of v, we obtain that [formula] So, X is a global offensive k-alliance, a contradiction.

If X is a k-goaf for k  ≤  δ, then |X|  ≤  n - 2, as a consequence, the above result can be simplified as follows.

If X is a k-goaf set, k∈{1,...,δ}, then there exists [formula] such that [formula] is a (k + 2)-goaf set.

It is easy to check the monotony of φgok, i.e., φgok(Γ)  ≤  φgok + 1(Γ). As we can see below, Theorem [\ref=teo-k-k+2] leads to an interesting property about the monotony of φgok.

For every k∈{1,..., min {δ,Δ - 2}} and [formula], φgok(Γ) + r  ≤  φgok + 2r(Γ).

If X is a k-daf set and [formula], then [formula] is (k + 2) - daf.

Let us suppose that there exists a defensive (k + 2)-alliance A such that [formula]. If v∉A, then A  ⊂  X, a contradiction because every defensive (k+2)-alliance is a defensive k-alliance. If v∈A, let [formula]. As for every u∈B, δB(u) = δA(u) - δ{v}(u) and [formula], we have, [formula] So, B  ⊆  X is a defensive k-alliance, a contradiction.

For every k∈{  -  Δ,...,Δ - 2} and [formula], φk(Γ) + r  ≤  φk + 2r(Γ).

Tight bounds

A dominating set S  ⊂  V is a global boundary offensive k-alliance if for every [formula], [formula] [\cite=Offboundary].

If {X,Y} is a vertex partition of a graph Γ into two global boundary offensive 0-alliances, then X and Y are minimal global offensive 0-alliances in Γ.

Let us suppose, for instance, that X is not a minimal global offensive 0-alliances, then, there exists A  ⊂  X, such that, [formula] and A is a global offensive 0-alliance. Thus, for every [formula], [formula].

As [formula] and {X,Y} is a vertex partition of the graph into two global boundary offensive 0-alliances, then for every v∈Y, [formula].

Therefore, as Y is a dominating set, the above expression carry out just in the case that A = X, a contradiction. So, X and Y are minimal global offensive 0-alliances.

For every k∈{0,...,Δ}, [formula].

First, we will prove the case k = 0. Let {X,Y} be a partition of the vertex set, such that [formula], [formula] and there is a minimum number of edges between X and Y. If X (or Y) is a 0-goaf set, then [formula]. We suppose there exist A  ⊂  X and B  ⊂  Y, such that A and B are global offensive 0-alliances. Hence [formula] and [formula] As Y  ⊂  Ā and X  ⊂   we have, for every v∈Y, δX(v)  ≥  δY(v) and for every v∈X, δY(v)  ≥  δX(v).

For any y∈Y and x∈X, let us take [formula] and [formula]. If δX(y) > δY(y) or δY(x) > δX(x) then, the edge cutset between X' and Y' is lesser than the other one between X and Y, a contradiction. Therefore δX(y) = δY(y) and δY(x) = δX(x) and, as a consequence, {X,Y} is a partition of the vertex set into two global boundary offensive 0-alliances. Now, by using Lemma [\ref=lema-fronteras] we obtain that X and Y are minimal global offensive 0-alliances. As a consequence, [formula].

Now, let us prove the case k > 0. Case 1: φgok(Γ)  ≥  n - 2. Since [formula] we have [formula]. Case 2: φgok(Γ) < n - 2. As every k-goaf set is also a (k + 1)-goaf set, [formula], then the statement is true for k = 1. Hence, we will proceed by induction on k. Let us assume that the statement is true for an arbitrary k∈{2,...,Δ - 2}, that is, there exists a maximal k-goaf set X in Γ such that, [formula]. Now, by Theorem [\ref=teo-k-k+2], there exists [formula], such that [formula] is a (k + 2)-goaf set. Therefore, [formula]. So, the proof is complete.

The above bound is attained, for instance, in the case of the complete graph if n and k are both even or if n and k have different parity: [formula].

[formula]

If X is a k-oaf set, then [formula] for some v∈∂X. Therefore, [formula] Thus, the upper bound is deduced.

If X is a maximal k-oaf set, then [formula] is a minimal k-oac set. Thus, for all [formula], there exists an offensive k-alliance Sv such that [formula]. Hence, [formula], for every u∈∂Sv. Therefore, δ(u) + k  ≤  2δSv(u)  ≤  2|Sv|  ≤  2(|X| + 1). Thus, the lower bound follows.

The above bounds are attained, for instance, for the complete graph: [formula]. For every k∈{0,...,Δ} it was established in [\cite=shafique] that [formula]. The next result shows other bounds on φk(Γ).

For any connected graph Γ, [formula] where μ denotes the algebraic connectivity of Γ.

It was shown in [\cite=RoGoSi] that the defensive k-alliance number is bounded by [formula]. On the other hand, if S is a defensive k-alliance of cardinality ak(Γ), then for all v∈S we have that [formula] is a k-daf set. Thus, φk(Γ)  ≥  ak(Γ) - 1. Hence, the lower bound on φk(Γ) follows.

Moreover, if X is a k-daf set, then [formula] Therefore, [formula] Thus, the upper bound follows.

The above bound is sharp as we can check, for instance, for the complete graph Γ = Kn. As the algebraic connectivity of Kn is μ = n, the above theorem gives the exact value of [formula]

For any connected graph Γ, [formula] where μ* denotes the Laplacian spectral radius of Γ.

The result immediately follows from Corollary [\ref=coro2] and the following bound obtained in [\cite=FeRoSi]: [formula]

The above bound is tight as we can check, for instance, for the complete graph Γ = Kn. As the Laplacian spectral radius of Kn is μ* = n, the above theorem gives the exact value of [formula]
