Introduction

X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) form a small subclass of radio galaxies with two misaligned pairs of radio lobes and radio luminosities close to the FR I/II transition. Assuming that the jets are aligned with the spin of the black hole (BH) at their origin these sources can be explained by rapid realignment of the jet: The coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (BHB), a product of a galaxy merger, quickly realigns the jet ([formula]), with the spin of the merged black hole being dominated by the orbital angular momentum of the BHB [\cite=cz:rottmann01] [\cite=cz:zier01] [\cite=cz:zier02] [\cite=cz:chirvasa02]. In at least two XRGs (NGC 326 and 3C 52) the ridges of the secondary lobes have been observed to be offset from each other laterally by about their width, hence showing a Z-shaped symmetry about the nucleus. As the galaxy merger proceeds and the captured galaxy spirals to the common center it induces a rotational stream-field in the ISM on large scales. If its trajectory passes through the polar regions of the primary galaxy, the ram pressure of the rotating ISM bends the original jet into Z-shape [\cite=cz:gopal03].

Deprojection of ZRGs & Results

Because the pre-merger spin of the primary BH and the orbital angular momentum of the merging BHB are not correlated the distribution of the angle between them is [formula], peaking at [formula]. Since the post-merger spin is dominated by the orbital angular momentum, the angle between pre- and post-merger jet follows the same distribution. This corresponds to the requirement that in Z-shaped radio galaxies (ZRGs) the secondary's trajectory passes through the polar regions of the primary galaxy. Spiralling inwards the ram pressure of the rotating ISM balances that of the jet in a distance r and the jet, with a power close to the FR I/II transition, will be bent into a Z-shape.

With the observed projected lateral offset of the ridges [formula] in the known distance D of the galaxy we can determine the angle [formula] between the pre- and post-merger jets in dependence on the bending radius r and the angle [formula] between our line of sight (LOS) and the post-merger jet. There are three possible orientations of the jets and the LOS relative to each other. The requirement of [formula] and [formula] to be large ([formula]) imposes certain limits on the bending radius: Only for [formula] first the orientation with both, the LOS and the receding part of the pre-merger jet in the same hemisphere, which is defind by the post-merger jet as polar axis, becomes possible. At [formula] also both other orientations enter the region of allowed angles, but are less likely. For NGC 326 and 3C 52 we obtain the limiting radii [formula] and [formula] respectively [\cite=cz:zier05]. This result, based on geometrical arguments only, is consistent with the location of [formula] where the ram pressure of a FR I/II-jet equates that of the rotating ISM. The peoperties of the gas stream which are required to bend the jet in Z-shape ([formula]) are also in very good agreement with observations and numerical simulations of galaxy mergers (see references in [\cite=cz:zier05]).

Discussion & Conclusions

Our results strongly support to the merger model for XRGs, and ZRGs as a special subclass with [formula]. They also strengthen the conjecture that a jet is aligned with the spin of the BH at its base and that the jet flips into the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the pre-merger BHB. We also could restrict the bending radius to the range [formula]. Another important result is that most likely the LOS and the receding part of the pre-merger jet are in the same hemisphere whose polar axis is defined by the post-merger jet. Knowing the correct orientation we also know the sense of rotation and consequently the direction of the spin of the post-merger BH. These conclusions have also an important impact on the conjecture favoured by some authors that after a merger of two galaxies the decay of the BHB stalls due to the depletion of the so-called loss cone. In contradiction the existence of XRGs and ZRGs proves that the binary has merged. In ZRGs it probably merges on timescales of some [formula] after the bending of the jet in a distance of about [formula]. Thus, in a way, the bending starts a stop watch for the rest of the merger.
