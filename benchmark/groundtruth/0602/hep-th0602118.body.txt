Introduction

The idea of separability within the study of solutions to the Einstein equations has proved extremely fruitful. The four dimensional Kerr-(A)dS black hole was discovered by Carter in [\cite=carter], by considering solutions of Einstein's equations that permit separable solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi and Klein-Gordon equations. Such separable solutions possess a hidden symmetry which is intimately related to the existence of a non-trivial Killing tensor. This is a second rank tensor, Kμν, that satisfies a generalised version of Killing's equation, [formula]. Such a Killing tensor gives rise to an additional constant of motion that is quadratic in the canonical momenta. This additional constant of motion, together with those arising from the Killing vectors, renders geodesic motion integrable, and the geodesic equation solvable by quadratures. Such integrable dynamical systems are rather rare and it is therefore a valuable exercise to study them in some detail.

With the emergence of string theory as a potential theory of everything, higher dimensional analogues of the four dimensional black holes were sought. The higher dimensional analogues of the asymptotically flat Kerr black hole were found by Myers and Perry, [\cite=mp], and it was only much more recently that higher dimensional, Kerr-(A)dS black holes were constructed, [\cite=glpp]. The five dimensional Myers-Perry and Kerr-(A)dS black holes were shown to possess Killing tensors for arbitrary rotation parameters in [\cite=stoj] and [\cite=kl1] respectively, and in the special case where there are two sets of equal rotation parameters, a Killing tensor has been found in all dimensions, [\cite=vs].

These higher dimensional, rotating black holes can be further generalised to include various types of charge. Electrically charged, Kerr-AdS black hole solutions have only recently been found in the context of D = 5 minimal gauged supergravity. The case where the two rotation parameters are equal was discovered in [\cite=clp4] and shown to have a reducible Killing tensor in [\cite=kl2]. This Killing tensor is also found in the case of black holes with equal rotation parameters in the more general U(1)3 theory. The case of arbitrary rotation parameters was found in [\cite=cclp] and was shown to have an irreducible Killing tensor in [\cite=dkl].

Another generalisation, and the one under consideration in this paper, is to include a NUT-like parameter. NUT charged spacetimes are of interest for many reasons. For example, their Euclidean extensions can be used in the study of monopoles in gauge theories and in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, asymptotically AdS, NUT charged spacetimes can be used to study various issues in the field of chronology protection. The four-dimensional Kerr-Taub-NUT-de Sitter solution was found by Carter in [\cite=carter2] using the idea of separability. Higher dimensional versions with one non-zero rotation parameter were found and shown to possess a Killing tensor in [\cite=cglp]. A large class of Taub-NUT solutions were shown to possess a Killing tensor in higher dimensions in [\cite=v]. In [\cite=clp1], a class of cohomogeneity-2, rotating, AdS black holes in higher dimensions were found that possess a generalisation of the NUT parameter, and it is these solutions that will provide the focus of this paper.

The metric takes slightly different forms in odd and even dimensions, but in both cases, the inverse metric multiplied by a simple function can be separated (non-uniquely) into the sum of two parts, each depending on a different coordinate. This allows the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to admit an additively separable solution, establishing geodesic integrability. This separation introduces a separation constant which can be understood as arising from a second rank Killing tensor, Kμν, contracted with the canonical momenta. This Killing tensor is found and shown to have a smooth limit as the cosmological constant tends to zero. We also show that the Klein-Gordon equation has separable solutions in all dimensions.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we study the odd-dimensional Kerr-AdS-NUT Solutions. We present the inverse metric and show that some multiple of it is additively separable as a function of the radial variable and an angular variable. We then demonstrate that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is separable and extract the Killing tensor from the separated angular equation. The last part of Section 2 demonstrates that the Klein-Gordon equation will possess separable solutions. Section 3 follows the same procedure as Section 2, but we consider the even dimensional case. In Section 4 we briefly summarise the main results of this work.

As this work was being written up, [\cite=clp3] appeared on the archive and showed exactly the same results as demonstrated here, namely the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Klein-Gordon equation, but in a different coordinate system to that used here.

Odd Dimensional Kerr-AdS-NUT Solutions

In odd spacetime dimensions, D = 2n + 1, the general Kerr-AdS black hole possesses n latitude coordinates μi subject to [formula], n azimuthal angles, a radial coordinate, r and a time coordinate, t. The generalisation that includes a NUT-type parameter requires a restriction on the n angular momenta so that they form two sets, with p angular momenta taking the value a and q taking the value b. In order to make this more transparent, a new coordinate, θ is introduced such that

[formula]

where n  =  p  +  q. It is convenient not to use the coordinate, θ, but to use the related variable, v, which satisfies

[formula]

For convenience, the azimuthal coordinates are also partitioned into two sets, with p of them denoted φi and q of them denoted φ̃j.

In terms of these new coordinates, the metric for the Kerr-AdS spacetime with the extra NUT-type parameter can be written [\cite=clp1]

[formula]

where

[formula]

In order to investigate the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi and Klein-Gordon equations in this background, we need to compute the inverse metric and show that, after being multiplied by a simple function, the r and v dependence of each component is additively separable. Performing this computation, we find that the inverse metric is given by:

[formula]

[formula]

Comparing the five-dimensional inverse to that given in [\cite=dkl] (having set the charge, q to zero), we see that there is complete agreement when L = 0 and the slightly different definitions have been taken into account. The dependence of gφiφj on ν2i may look troublesome, but in fact it does not affect the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation or the Klein-Gordon equation.

We have introduced some new notation. The latitudes νi and j have been written in terms of αi and βj according to the following equations ,

[formula]

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation in odd dimensions

In this section, we shall prove that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation has a separable solution. We shall also determine the Killing tensor which gives rise to the extra constant of the motion required for the spacetime to be geodesically integrable.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is

[formula]

We shall assume a separable solution for Hamilton's Principal Function:

[formula]

Inserting this ansatz into the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and multiplying through by 2(r2  +  v2), we find the following equation:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The terms involving the αi and βj can be separated off and set equal to a constant, that is

[formula]

We shall deal with these terms in more detail later. Returning to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation ([\ref=hj]), we can now separate the r and v dependence, obtaining the two equations:

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

The last thing to show is that the αi and βj terms can also be separated. One can easily show that equation ([\ref=alphaterms]) can be separated, giving rise to the following equations for the Sαi [\cite=vs]:

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula]. Similarly, for the βi terms, we find:

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula]. This confirms that the separable ansatz ([\ref=S:ansatz]) is true and that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is indeed separable. Thus, the Kerr-AdS-NUT spacetime is geodesically integrable in odd dimensions.

The irreducible Killing tensor can be extracted from the v-dependent separation equation, ([\ref=sep:v]). We shall define the Killing tensor by the equation K  =  Kμνpμpν, where pμ is the canonical momentum. Recalling that m2  =    -  gμνpμpν, we find

[formula]

where the tensors, Jμν1 and Lμν1 are the reducible Killing tensors associated to the α and β terms in the separation [\cite=vsp]. Formulae for these are derived in the appendix ([\ref=Jmunu], [\ref=Lmunu]). We have confirmed that this Killing tensor reduces to that given in equation (11) of [\cite=dkl] when the appropriate limits are taken. Unlike the Killing tensor given in [\cite=vs], ([\ref=killingtensor]) has a smooth limit as g  →  0. This is merely an artifact of the non-uniqueness of separating the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, or equivalently, the r and v dependence of the inverse metric. By adding appropriate outer products of Killing vectors, the L = 0 limit of ([\ref=killingtensor]) can be made to agree with that given in [\cite=vs].

Since there are only two rotation parameters, there are two sets of identical planes of rotation. These give rise to extra Killing vectors whose action is to shift between the planes of a given rotation parameter. These Killing vectors, along with the Killing tensor presented above provide the extra constants of motion needed to ensure that the geodesic equation is integrable.

The Klein-Gordon equation in odd dimensions

The Klein-Gordon equation governs the quantum field theory of massive, spinless particles on this background. It can be written as

[formula]

The separability of the Klein-Gordon equation depends, crucially, on the coordinate dependence of the metric determinant being factorisable. We find that the metric determinant is given by

[formula]

[formula]

where m is the determinant of the metric on a unit m-sphere. It is important to note that the ρ2n - 2ω2n - 2 term provides a factor of r2  +  v2 in [formula], since this allows the inverse metric to separate additively. The rest of the determinant is factorisable into functions of r, v αi and βj. Thus, the Klein-Gordon equation in odd dimensions will have separable solutions of the form:

[formula]

Even Dimensional Kerr-AdS-NUT Solutions

The metric for even dimensions, D  =  2n, can be obtained from the Kerr-AdS metric by splitting the rotation parameters into two sets, with one set taking the value a and the other set taking the value 0 and then including the NUT parameter as before. The latitude coordinates can be split up in the same way as in ([\ref=lat]), introducing a coordinate, θ. To simplify the equations, we replace θ with the coordinate v defined by

[formula]

which then gives the metric

[formula]

where

[formula]

and Ξa is given by the same equation as in the odd dimensional case. The relationship between p, q and n is now p  +  q  +  1  =  n. The definitions of Δr and Δv are the same as in the odd dimensional case.

Again, in order to show that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is separable, and hence that the geodesic equation is integrable, we must show that the inverse metric can be split up in a particular way. Computing the inverse metric, we find

[formula]

where, as before, we have introduced latitude coordinates, {αi} and {βj}, with αi defined as in ([\ref=alpha:beta]), and βj defined by the slightly modified equation

[formula]

As in the odd dimensional case, we have set αp  =  βq + 1  =  0 to impose the constraints on the {νi} and the {j}.

This inverse metric is simpler than the odd-dimensional case because there is no coupling between t and the {φ̃i}. Again, the r and v dependence separates and this will allow the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation in even dimensions

We consider an ansatz for Hamilton's Principal Function, S, that is separable:

[formula]

Substituting this ansatz into the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, ([\ref=jacobi]), and multiplying through by r2  +  v2 we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

As in the odd dimensional case, one can separate out the α dependent terms, obtaining ([\ref=alphasep1]) and ([\ref=alphasep2]) so we can replace the α dependent terms in ([\ref=hjeven]) with a constant, J21.

The β dependent terms separate in a similar way to odd dimensional case, but there is a slight difference due to the number of latitudes being the same as the number of azimuthal angles, instead of one fewer. Setting

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula], allows the β dependent terms in ([\ref=hjeven]) to be replaced by a constant, L21.

We can now separate ([\ref=hjeven]) into terms depending only on r and v.

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

We have therefore shown that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the AdS-Kerr-NUT spacetime in even dimensions is separable and that geodesic motion on it is integrable.

We can use ([\ref=vdep:even]) to write down an irreducible Killing tensor for the AdS-Kerr-NUT spacetime in even dimensions:

[formula]

Again, we have computed the inverse metric in such a way that the Killing tensor has a smooth limit as g  →  0. The tensors Jμν1 and Lμν1 are the reducible Killing tensors arising from the α and β separation and are given in the appendix, by equations ([\ref=Jmunu]) and ([\ref=Lmunu]). They take the same form as in odd dimensions.

The Klein-Gordon equation in even dimensions

As in the odd-dimensional case, the separability of the Klein-Gordon equation in even dimensions will depend upon the factorisation of the determinant of the metric. We find the following result:

[formula]

Again, this determinant possesses a factor of (r2  +  v2)2 so we can exploit the additive separability of the inverse metric. The remainder then factorises into parts depending on r, v, αi and βj. As in the odd dimensional case, the potentially problematic αi dependence of gφiφj can be handled in the same manner as when the Hamilton-Jacobi equation was separated. Therefore, the Klein-Gordon equation in even dimensions possesses separable solutions of the form

[formula]

Summary of results

In this paper, we have studied the recently discovered, cohomogeneity-2, rotating, AdS black holes with a NUT-like charge. By computing the inverse metric in all dimensions, and showing that (r2  +  v2)gμν is additively separable as a function of r and v, we were able to demonstrate complete separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This non-trivial result means that the geodesic equation is integrable. The integrability of the geodesic equation can be explained by a hidden symmetry that gives rise to an extra constant of the motion which is quadratic in the canonical momenta. This is intimately tied to the existence of a second rank Killing tensor which we have found for all dimensions and displayed in equations ([\ref=killingtensor]) and ([\ref=kteven]).

We also considered the Klein-Gordon equation for this new class of black holes. By computing the determinant of the metric in both odd ([\ref=detodd]) and even ([\ref=deteven]) dimensions, we were able to show that the combination [formula] factorises and therefore, the Klein-Gordon equation will possess separable solutions, allowing the quantum field theory of massive, spinless particles to be readily understood.
