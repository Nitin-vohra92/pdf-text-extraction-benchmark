Critical Temperature and Thermodynamics of Attractive Fermions at Unitarity

The unitarity limit is commonly referred to as the limit of a diverging scattering length a  →    ∞  , and an effective range of the interaction re  →  0. A Fermi gas in this limit attains universality: at low enough temperature the only relevant length scale is given by the density, n, since the divergent scattering length drops out completely and the system's properties are independent of the interaction details. The unitarity limit is approximately realized in the inner crust of the neutron stars, where the neutron-neutron scattering length is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the mean interparticle separation [\cite=neutron-star]. Unitarity conditions can also be achieved with cold trapped atom gases using the Feshbach resonance technique, i.e. tuning the scattering length to infinity using the magnetic field. In recent years these systems have been extensively studied experimentally [\cite=BEC-BCS-expt] [\cite=Thomas_expt].

In the limit of ξ  =  1 / na3  →    +    ∞   the fermions pair into bosonic molecules and form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In the opposite limit ξ  →    -    ∞   one recovers the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit. The unitarity limit ξ  →  0 separates these two extremes. In all these cases, a gas undergoes a superfluid (SF) phase transition at some temperature, which depends on ξ.

The early analytical treatments of the unitary Fermi gas have been based on the extension of the BCS-type many-body wave function [\cite=classiki]. Most of the subsequent elaborations are also of mean-field type (with or without fluctuations) [\cite=mf] [\cite=Ohashi-Griffin] [\cite=Holland-Timmermans] [\cite=LiuHu] [\cite=Perali] [\cite=Haussmann94]. The accuracy and reliability of such approximations is nevertheless questionable given the strongly interacting nature of the unitarity regime, and the results differ by nearly an order of magnitude.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of Fermi systems are, in general, severely hindered by a sign problem [\cite=Binder-Landau-book]. Fortunately for fermions with attractive contact interaction the sign problem can be avoided [\cite=Hirsch] [\cite=Rubtsov] [\cite=Kaplan]. The ground state of a unitary Fermi gas has been studied within a fixed-node MC framework [\cite=Giorgini-Carlson], the systematic errors of which depend on the quality of a guess of the nodal structure of a many-body fermion configuration. Despite a number of calculations at finite temperatures [\cite=Bulgac] [\cite=Wingate] [\cite=Lee-Schaefer], a reliable estimate of the critical temperature is lacking. The purpose of this Letter is to provide accurate results for the critical temperature and thermodynamic functions of a three-dimensional (3D) unitary Fermi gas using a novel determinant diagrammatic MC method free of systematic errors.

Consider an attractive Hubbard model (AHM) defined by the Hamiltonian H  =  H0  +  H1, with

[formula]

where [formula] is a fermion creation operator, [formula], [formula] is the spin index, [formula] enumerates sites of a 3D simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions, the quasimomentum [formula] spans the corresponding Brillouin zone, [formula] is the tight-binding spectrum, t = 1 is the the hopping amplitude, μ stands for the chemical potential, U > 0 is the on-site attraction, and we have set the lattice spacing to unity.

By solving the two-body problem of the model ([\ref=AHM]) one finds that the scattering length diverges at [formula]. We use this value of U throughout. Since we are ultimately interested in the continuum rather than lattice results, we study the low density limit ν  →  0, where [formula] is the filling fraction. We define Fermi momentum as kF  =  (3π2ν)1 / 3 and Fermi energy εF  =  k2F, as those of a continuum gas with the same effective mass and number density n = ν.

We simulate the model ([\ref=AHM]) by diagrammatic determinant MC, discussed in detail in Refs. [\cite=Rubtsov] [\cite=we]. One starts by expanding exp ( - βH) in the interaction representation in powers of H1. The resulting Feynmann diagrams consist of four-point vertices representing the Hubbard interaction, connected by free single-particle propagators. The sum over all possible ways of connecting vertices with propagators, in the n-th order diagram is represented by a vertex configuration [formula], where τ is the imaginary time, see Fig. [\ref=fig:conf] . In case of equal number of spin-up and spin-down particles, the differential weight of a configuration is positive definite:

[formula]

where [formula] is an n  ×  n matrix built on single-particle propagators: [formula].

The configuration space is sampled with worm-type [\cite=worm] updating scheme [\cite=inpreparation], based on the two-particle correlation function

[formula]

where Tτ is the τ  -  ordering, [formula] is the pair annihilation operator, a normalization factor N  =  βL3 is introduced for future convenience (β is an inverse temperature), and [formula] is the thermal average. The non-zero asymptotic value of [formula] as [formula] is proportional to the condensate density.

Fig. [\ref=fig:conf] shows a sketch of a vertex configuration, which features a pair of two-point vertices associated with [formula] and [formula].

The typical number of vertices in a configuration scales with the system volume as [formula]. Thus the Metropolis acceptance ratios for the updates involve the ratio of macroscopically large determinants [formula] with n' = n or [formula]. Since we only need ratios of determinants, fast-update formulas [\cite=Rubtsov] can be used to reduce the computational complexity of an update from M3 down to M2.

We validate our method by comparing results against the exact diagonalization data for a 4  ×  4 cluster [\cite=Husslein], and simulations of a critical temperature at quarter filling [\cite=Zotos] [\cite=DCA]. In both cases we find agreement within a few percent accuracy.

We work in the grand canonical ensemble at fixed (L, ~ T, ~ μ). Extracting the unitarity limit critical temperature, Tc, for the continuum gas from the lattice simulation is a two-stage process: first, we study the thermodynamic limit L  →    ∞   to obtain Tc(ν) at a given ν ,and then extrapolate to the continuum limit ν  →  0.

The first task is performed as follows: we simulate a series of system sizes [formula] at various temperatures. At the critical point the correlation function ([\ref=corr]) decays as a power-law at large distances: [formula], where η is an anomalous dimension. Since the transition is expected to belong to the U(1) universality class, we use η  =  0.038 [\cite=Fisher]. Hence, if one sums and rescales the correlation function ([\ref=corr]) according to

[formula]

the intersection of the curves R(Li,T) and R(Lj,T), shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:crossing], gives a size-dependent estimate TLi,Lj(μ) for the critical temperature Tc(μ) [\cite=Binder]. As L  →    ∞  , the series of TLi,Lj(μ) converges to Tc(μ) and one can analyze it using corrections to scaling, to extract its limiting value [\cite=Binder-Landau-book]. Likewise, a linear fit of a size-dependent estimate for the filling factor ν(L;μ) versus 1 / L yields the thermodynamic limit filling factor ν(μ).

The next step is to repeat the procedure for a sequence of μ values and extrapolate the resultant series of Tc(ν) towards ν  →  0 using the leading order form [formula]. This functional form is expected from the analysis of the difference between the scattering T-matrices on the lattice and in the continuum [\cite=inpreparation].

Shown in Fig. [\ref=fig-tc] are the simulation results for the critical temperature at filling factors ranging from 0.95 down to 0.06. We use system sizes up to 163 sites with up to 300 fermions. It is clearly seen that starting from ν  ≈  0.5 the expected ν1 / 3 scaling holds very well and the subleading corrections are negligible. On the other hand, close to half-filling, Tc(ν) is essentially constant, (see, e.g. [\cite=Micnas]).

Figure [\ref=fig-tc] shows a strong dependence of Tc(ν) on ν. This is in apparent contradiction with Ref. [\cite=Bulgac] which assumes no such dependence. This might be due to different single-particle spectra εk  : Ref. [\cite=Bulgac] employs a parabolic spectrum with a spherically symmetric cutoff, while we use a tight-binding spectrum over all of the Brillouin zone. Our preliminary tests show that ~  ν1 / 3 corrections do depend on the specific choice of single-particle spectrum, and may even have different signs for different εk.

The critical temperature we derive from Fig. [\ref=fig-tc] is Tc = 0.152(7)εF. Various approximate schemes have in the past yielded Tc to be either above [\cite=mf] [\cite=Holland-Timmermans] [\cite=Perali] or below [\cite=LiuHu] [\cite=Ohashi-Griffin] [\cite=Haussmann94] the BEC limit [formula]. Our results clearly show that it is below.

Previous numerical results were also in disagreement on whether Tc is higher or lower than [formula]: Ref. [\cite=Wingate] quotes Tc  /  εF = 0.05, but the scattering length has not been determined precisely. Most probably, this result corresponds to a deep BCS regime, where the critical temperature is exponentially suppressed. Lee and Schäfer [\cite=Lee-Schaefer] claim an upper limit Tc  <  0.14εF. This result is based on a study of the caloric curve of a unitary Fermi gas down to T / εF = 0.14 for filling factors down to ν = 0.5. The caloric curve of Ref. [\cite=Lee-Schaefer] shows no signs of divergent heat capacity which would signal the phase transition. We find it not surprising since at quarter filling Tc(ν = 0.5) / εF  ≈  0.05, see Fig. [\ref=fig-tc]. The simulations of Ref. [\cite=Bulgac], which are also based on a caloric curve study, yield Tc  =  0.23(2)εF. What this otherwise excellent treatment lacks is an accurate finite-size and finite-density analysis of the MC data.

The value of Tc determined in this work cannot be directly compared to the experimental result Tc  =  0.27(2)εF [\cite=Thomas_expt] for a number of reasons. First, there are strong indications that a presence of a trap significantly enhances the transition temperature, see e.g. Ref. [\cite=Perali]. Second, the data analysis of Ref. [\cite=Thomas_expt] relies on a mean-field approximate theory for relating the empirical and actual temperature scales. In this regard, it would be extremely interesting to see to what extent the results of Ref. [\cite=Thomas_expt] would be affected if a different theoretical scheme is employed for thermometry.

At unitarity, the thermodynamic functions acquire a self-similar form [\cite=Ho]. For example, for the free energy one has:

[formula]

where N is the number of particles, V is the volume, and f(F)(x) is a dimensionless function. Eq. ([\ref=F]) allows one to express all thermodynamic potentials in terms of energy per particle f(E) = E / NεF and rescaled chemical potential f(μ)  =  μ  /  εF. The latter quantities are directly measurable numerically.

An analysis similar to the calculation of Tc yields

[formula]

For the pressure P and entropy S, one than has

[formula]

which follows from ([\ref=magic_numbers]) and exact relations PV = (2 / 3)E and S  =  (5E / 3  -  μN) / NT. Eqs. ([\ref=magic_numbers])-([\ref=magic_numbers_1]) are for T = Tc.

Shown in Fig. [\ref=emuplot] are our results for the dependence of the energy per particle and chemical potential on temperature. In the high-temperature simulations we use system sizes of up to 323 sites with up to 80 fermions.

As can be seen in Fig. [\ref=emuplot], our results for both energy and chemical potential approach values close to the fixed-node MC values [\cite=Giorgini-Carlson] as T  →  0. For [formula] our results are not far from the curve of Ref. [\cite=Bulgac]. As T / εF  →    ∞  , both energy and chemical potential approach the virial expansion [\cite=HoMueller] at high temperatures.

In conclusion, we have performed a determinant diagrammatic MC simulations of a unitary Fermi gas by means of diluting the attractive Hubbard model. In order to extract the continuum gas behaviour we carefully treat both finite-size and lattice corrections. We have determined the critical temperature Tc  /  εF  =  0.152(7), the values of the thermodynamic functions at criticality, and the overall shape of the thermodynamic potentials from zero- to high-temperature regimes.
