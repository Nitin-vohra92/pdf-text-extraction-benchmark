Introduction

The classical test-bed of the Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GTR), in its linearized weak-field and slow-motion approximation [\cite=soffel] valid in the Earth's neighborhood and throughout the Solar System, has always been represented by the motion of test particles and electromagnetic waves in the gravitational field of massive astronomical bodies [\cite=will]. This is so due to the extreme smallness of the relativistic effects with respect to the much larger Newtonian features of gravity.

However, in the more or less recent past various Earth-based laboratory experiments [\cite=bra] [\cite=pippard] [\cite=bra2] [\cite=vitale] [\cite=tartrug02] [\cite=stedman] [\cite=ioriopolo] have been proposed, mainly to detect the elusive gravitomagnetic part of the gravitational field of the Earth induced by its proper angular momentum (see Section [\ref=gtr]). Up to now, they have not been performed, mainly due to the extreme difficulty both to reach the necessary high sensitivity and to cope with the numerous and much larger classical noising effects of natural and cultural origin.

In regard to the possibility of testing GTR with terrestrial geodetic techniques [\cite=soffel], gravimetry can allow to penetrate into the relativistic regime. Among the most sensitive apparatus there are the superconducting gravimeters (SG) [\cite=goodk]. Their most remarkable quality is their high immunity to the environmental temperature variations, that generally determine variations of the elastic constant of the mechanical spring which, indeed, is replaced by a magnetic levitation of a superconducting sphere in the magnetic field of superconducting, persistent current coils. The goal is to utilize the high stability of such currents to create a perfectly stable spring. The magnetic levitation is designed to provide independent adjustment of the total levitating force and the force gradient so that it can support the full weight of the sphere and still yield a large displacement for a small change in gravity. Recent developments in such a field have pushed the accuracy of SG down to 10- 12g = 10- 11 m s- 2  =   1 ngal [\cite=nanogal] for relative measurements. For some SG performed tests of certain non-relativistic preferred-frame and preferred-locations effects, in the context of the Parameterized Post Newtonian (PPN) formalism, see Section 8.2 of [\cite=WIL]. However, it must also be noted that there are great difficulties to use SG in absolute measurements due to calibration issues.

The post-Newtonian general relativistic components of the acceleration of gravity

The acceleration experienced by a test mass in the gravitational field of a central body, to the post-Newtonian O(c- 2) level of GTR in its linearized weak-field and slow-motion approximation, is represented by a gravitoelectric component, due to the Schwarzschild part [\cite=Schw] of the spacetime metric, and a gravitomagnetic component, due to the Lense-Thirring part [\cite=leti] of the spacetime metric. We can write it as [formula] with [\cite=soffel]

[formula]

G is the Newtonian gravitational constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, M is the mass of the central body, [formula] is its proper angular momentum, [formula] and [formula] are the position and velocity vectors, respectively, of the test mass. It is assumed that the origin of the adopted inertial reference frame is located at the centre of mass of the body of mass M.

Absolute measurements at the pole and the equator

We will now explore the possibility of measuring the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components of the terrestrial gravitational field by measuring the acceleration of gravity at the equator and at the South Pole and making a cross-check between these two absolute measurements. To this aim, let us, now, consider a test body fixed on the Earth'surface, so that [formula] and v = ωR cos λ where [formula] is the Earth's angular velocity vector, [formula] is a unit vector from the Earth's centre to the location of the test mass, λ is the geocentric latitude and R is the Earth's radius at the location of the test body. From ([\ref=accel]) it is easy to see that at the equator [formula] the Lense-Thirring acceleration is entirely radial and directed outward, as the centrifugal acceleration, while at the South Pole it is absent ([formula]). The gravitoelectric Schwarzschild component is always directed radially because at the equator [formula] and at the poles [formula]. Then, the acceleration of gravity can be written as

[formula]

where the difference between the Earth's radius at the poles and at the equator is related to the Earth's flattening f by

[formula]

Then, we can write for [formula]

[formula]

Now we will evaluate the magnitude of the various terms entering ([\ref=digi]) in order to compare them with the present-day available sensitivity of SG. Then, we will also evaluate the systematic errors induced by the classical terms of ([\ref=digi]) due to the uncertainties in the various geodetic parameters of the Earth. Of course, there are also various classical time-dependent competing surface gravity effects spanning a wide range of periodicities from 1 s to more than 1 year and magnitudes up to 1 - 10 μgal=10- 5 - 10- 4 m s- 2 which would act as systematic bias. They should be accounted for in a detailed error budget, which is, however, beyond the scope of the present paper.

The Lense-Thirring component

By using the values of Table [\ref=para] it turns out that the Lense-Thirring component [formula] of ([\ref=digi]) amounts to 1.5  ×  10- 11 m s- 2, i.e. ~   1 ngal.

The systematic errors

In order to obtain ΔgLT we should subtract the first three terms of ([\ref=digi]) from the measured Δg. This can only be done if the uncertainty of the terms to be subtracted is smaller that the predicted value of the Lense-Thirring component.

The residual Schwarzschild component would not pose problems. Indeed, its nominal value is

[formula]

According to the uncertainties released in Table [\ref=para] it turns out that δ(ΔgSchwarzschild)  ≪  ΔgLT. The problems come from the classical terms. Indeed,

[formula]

which is nine orders of magnitude larger than the gravitomagnetic term. The errors induced by the uncertainty in f and the Earth's mean equatorial radius Req are the largest ones and amount to

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. The centrifugal component amounts to

[formula]

with an error of δ(Δgcentrifugal) = 1.48  ×  10- 9 m s- 2. The total error in the classical part of Δg is, thus

[formula]

it is two orders of magnitude larger than ΔgLT. This rules out the possibility of measuring the gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring component of the acceleration of gravity with the present-day SG.

The Schwarzschild component

From ([\ref=gravity]) it can be noted that an absolute measurement at the South Pole could allow to detect the gravitoelectric Schwarzschild component of the acceleration of gravity. Indeed, it turns out that

[formula]

The systematic errors

On the other hand, the errors in the classical part are δgclasspol|GM = 1.979  ×  10- 8 m s- 2, δgclasspol|Req = 3.0724  ×  10- 7 m s- 2, δgclasspol|f = 1.97  ×  10- 9 m s- 2. The total systematic error would then be

[formula]

i.e. one order of magnitude larger than gSchwarzschildpol. Note that ([\ref=dschwa]) and ([\ref=errdgtot]) rule also out the possibility of a measurement of the gravitoelectric component of the acceleration of gravity between the pole and the equator by one order of magnitude.

Discussion and conclusions

In this paper we have preliminarily investigated the feasibility of an experiment aimed at the measurement of the general relativistic gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components of the terrestrial acceleration of gravity at the equator and at the pole. It turns out that they are quite small; the difference between the gravitoelectric accelerations in the two places amounts to 3  ×  10- 10 m s- 2 and the difference of the gravitomagnetic accelerations is 1.5  ×  10- 11 m s- 2, i.e. 10 ngal and 1 ngal, respectively. Such absolute measurements could be done, in principle, with SG. However, it must be noted that the greatest difficulty in the use of the SG as an absolute instrument is connected with its calibration. Another non-trivial difficulty is that the effects to be measured are in continuous. Moreover, the present-day sensitivity of SG is just of the order of ngal, but only for relative measurements. In regard to systematic bias, the current uncertainties in the Earth's geodetic parameters, which enter the classical Newtonian terms to be subtracted, induce errors 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the relativistic ones.
