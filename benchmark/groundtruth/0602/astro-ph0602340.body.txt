Using H+3 and H2D+ as probes of star-forming regions

Introduction

The formation of stars and planets is a crucial step in the life cycle of matter in galaxies, but remains poorly understood. While optical and near-infrared observations are useful to locate newborn stars and measure the distribution of ionised gas, the cool and dense gas where the actual star formation takes place is best probed by long-wavelength (infrared through radio) observations. Molecular spectroscopy is an essential part of this effort, thanks to the richness of molecular spectra with many rotational and rovibrational lines which probe a large range of temperatures, densities, and optical depths.

This paper reviews the role of line observations of H+3 and its isotopologues in the determination of basic parameters of star-forming regions. After an outline of modern methods to obtain descriptions of the temperature and density structure of star-forming regions (§ [\ref=s:sfr]), § [\ref=s:zeta] shows how observations of H+3 (and other ions) may be used to measure the ionisation rate of molecular gas. Section [\ref=s:deut] discusses determinations of the chemistry and kinematics of pre-stellar cores from H2D+ and D2H+ observations, and § [\ref=s:future] concludes with an outline of future opportunities.

Measuring molecular abundances

The interpretation of molecular spectra from star-forming regions requires knowledge of their physical structure. The envelopes of young stars have temperature and density distributions which are strongly centrally peaked. For example, in the envelope of AFGL 2136, one of the first sources where H+3 was discovered, the temperature drops from 450 K at 6×  1015 cm to 22 K at 2×  1018 cm from the central star, while the density drops from ~  107 to ~  104 cm- 3 over the same distance. Such gradients lead to significant chemical stratification. In the cool outer envelope, the gas-phase chemistry is dominated by ion-molecule reactions which do not have activation barriers. Closer to the central star, neutral-neutral reactions become increasingly important. In addition, at low temperatures, atoms and molecules freeze out on grain surfaces where they may react with each other. The dominant type of reaction is hydrogenation at low densities and oxygenation at higher densities. The resulting ice mantles evaporate off the dust grains when the temperature exceeds ~  100 K.

The temperature and density gradients in protostellar envelopes also manifest themselves as gradients in the molecular excitation. While in the case of infrared observations of rovibrational bands, the excitation temperature can be measured directly, the determination of molecular column densities from radio observations often relies on a single or just a few transitions. To be able to compare column densities from different molecules which may have been derived from lines with very different upper level energies and/or radiative decay rates (hence critical densities), a comprehensive excitation model of the source is essential.

Modern schemes to construct models of star-forming regions are discussed by [\citet=doty:16293]. Total mass and temperature structure of the envelope is obtained from dust continuum observations, while the density structure is inferred from molecular lines. In constraining model parameters, it is important to be aware that different lines are observed with different beam sizes and thus do not sample quite the same gas. For further details please consult [\citet=vdtak:catania].

Probing the cosmic-ray ionisation rate

One key parameter of star-forming regions is the ionisation fraction of the molecular gas. First, the electron fraction determines the influence of magnetic fields on the dynamics, in particular the efficiency of magnetic support against gravitational collapse. Furthermore, the ionisation fraction sets the time scale of ion-molecule chemistry, which is the most important type of chemical reactions in the gas phase at temperatures of ~  10 K and densities of ~  104 cm- 3. Under these conditions, the bulk of the ionisation is due to 'cosmic rays' (~  100 MeV protons, produced in supernovae), at a rate ζCR, while ionisation by stellar~  1-10 keV X-rays becomes important on small scales ([\citeauthor=stauber:x-ray] [\citeyear=stauber:x-ray]). To estimate ζCR, [\citet=vdtak:zeta] have used models of the temperature and density structure of the envelopes of seven young high-mass stars to model observations of H+3 absorption and HCO+ emission lines. They find ζCR ~  3×  10- 17 s- 1, in good agreement with measurements of the local flux of low-energy cosmic rays with the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft ([\citeauthor=webber:voyager] [\citeyear=webber:voyager]). The models reproduce ~  half of the observed N(H+3), suggesting that the other half arises in intervening clouds.

Recent observations suggest strong variations of ζCR between lines of sight, which appear related to column density. On the one hand, observations of (sub-)millimetre  emission lines of DCO+ and other ions towards the low-mass pre-stellar core LDN 1544 indicate a decrease of ζCR by a factor of ~  10 ([\citeauthor=caselli:zeta] [\citeyear=caselli:zeta]), although depletion of CO and other neutrals onto grains may influence this result. On the other hand, observations of H+3 absorption lines toward the ζ Per diffuse cloud ([\citeauthor=mccall:zeta_per] [\citeyear=mccall:zeta_per]) indicate an enhancement of ζCR by a factor of ~  10 ([\citeauthor=lepetit:zeta_per] [\citeyear=lepetit:zeta_per]). These estimates are quite reliable now there is a consensus between experiment and theory on the rate coefficient of dissociative recombination of H+3 at low temperatures (see Greene, this conference). Even larger cosmic-ray ionisation rates of several 10- 15 s- 1 are found towards the Galactic Centre, where [\citet=oka:sgra] obtain N(H+3)~  4×  1015 cm- 2 from multi-line H+3 observations (see also Geballe, these proceedings). However, this N(H+3) estimate may change slightly if infrared pumping is taken into account. The high stellar density in the Galactic Centre implies an infrared radiation field which is ~  1000 times higher than in local clouds. Furthermore, the assumption of steady-state excitation of H+3 may break down at the high H+3 formation and destruction rates in the Galactic Centre clouds. Calculations of N(H+3) and ζCR toward Sgr A which take these effects into account are needed (see also Le Petit, these proceedings). Nevertheless, an enhanced ionisation rate in the inner 250 pc of our Galaxy is consistent with its strong synchrotron radio emission which signifies an enhanced electron component of the cosmic rays. Furthermore, the Galactic Centre is a strong source of X-rays which may provide additional ionisation.

Even without the Galactic Centre region, evidence is mounting that ζCR is higher in regions with lower column density. Cosmic rays penetrate to a typical surface density of ~  50 g cm- 2 ([\citeauthor=umebayashi:cosmic-rays] [\citeyear=umebayashi:cosmic-rays]), which corresponds to an N(H2) of ~  1025 cm- 2. Even the Sgr B2 clouds, which are the most massive clouds in the Galaxy, only have N(H2) ~   1-3×  1024 cm- 2, so that absorption of cosmic rays probably only plays a minor role except very locally. Instead, the apparent scaling of the ionisation rate with density may be due to cosmic-ray scattering off plasma waves. This process is more efficient in denser clouds where magnetic fields are stronger ([\citeauthor=padoan:cr_mhd] [\citeyear=padoan:cr_mhd]), which would explain the observed trend.

[\citet=liszt:grains] has suggested that the models for star-forming regions fail to include recombination on dust grains. This process is certainly important for diffuse clouds, where grains are small and strongly positively charged by UV photons ([\citeauthor=vdishoeck:diffuse] [\citeyear=vdishoeck:diffuse]). In dense star-forming regions, coagulation increases the average size of the grains and thus reduces their abundance by number, given the observed constant mass ratio of dust and gas ([\citeauthor=ossenkopf:opacities] [\citeyear=ossenkopf:opacities]). However, grain charging in these regions is mainly by collisions, and the negatively charged dust grains are very good at neutralizing positive gas-phase ions ([\citeauthor=tielens:ism] [\citeyear=tielens:ism]). The processes governing the size and charge of the dust in dense clouds are thus quite different from those in diffuse clouds, and detailed models are needed to assess their importance for the overall ionisation balance.

One critical parameter of chemical models of star-forming regions is the ratio of the He and H ionisation rates. Only the He ions are able to break strong chemical bonds such as the triple bond of the CO molecule, so that the atomic carbon abundance for instance depends sensitively on ζHe/ζH. This ratio is insensitive to the slope of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum since most damage is done by secondary electrons, whose spectrum depends on the electron fraction and the H/H2 ratio of the gas. Observational constraints on these quantities are urgently needed.

Chemistry and kinematics of pre-stellar cores

Lacking an allowed rotational spectrum, the H+3 ion needs a mid-infrared 'background lamp' to be visible in absorption. Using H2D+ as an alternative route to ζCR is problematic because the strong temperature dependence of the H2D+/H+3 ratio means that the two species do not trace the same gas. Other ions such as HCO+ and H3O+ are more suitable as substitutes of H+3, particularly if observations of CO and H2O are available ([\citeauthor=vdtak:h2o] [\citeyear=vdtak:h2o]). Instead, the astrophysical use of H2D+ is that of a 'chemical filter' to image the distribution of cold ([formula]10 K) dense ([formula]105 cm- 3) gas. Under these conditions, the formation of H2D+ from HD +   H+3 is strongly enhanced because the back reaction has a barrier; and its destruction is reduced because the main destroyers of H2D+, CO, O and N2, freeze out onto the surfaces of dust grains. See [\citet=roberts:models] and Roberts (these proceedings) for a detailed description of these processes.

The detection of strong H2D+ 372 GHz emission toward the pre-stellar core LDN 1544 indicates the existence of a region of several 1016 cm radius where all elements heavier than He are frozen out onto dust grains. Under these extreme conditions, H+3 and its isotopologues become the dominant carriers of positive charge, a role normally played by metals (S+, Fe+) and CNO molecules (HCO+, H3O+, N2H+). Additional evidence for CNO-free zones comes from the detection of D2H+ (sub-)millimetre emission toward the pre-stellar core LDN 1689N ([\citeauthor=vastel:d2h+] [\citeyear=vastel:d2h+]) and other cores (Vastel, these proceedings). However, observations of deuterated ammonia toward the same cores indicate that the depletion may not be as complete as thought before ([\citeauthor=lis:nd2h] [\citeyear=lis:nd2h]), or limited to a smaller region. Indeed, the H2D+ abundance of ~  1×  10- 9 in LDN 1544 by [\citet=caselli:h2d+] has probably been overestimated by up to a factor of 10 through the collisional rate coefficient ([\citeauthor=vdtak:l1544] [\citeyear=vdtak:l1544]) and the kinetic temperature (Crapsi et al., in prep.). Nevertheless, the H2D+ abundance is clearly higher in pre-stellar cores than around low-mass protostars ([\citealt=stark:h2d+], [\citeyear=stark:16293]).

Thus, although better data are needed to determine the sizes of the CNO-free zones, the very existence of such zones at the centres of pre-stellar cores implies that the relative abundances of H+3, H2D+ and D2H+ are sensitive to the grain size ([\citeauthor=flower:grain_size] [\citeyear=flower:grain_size]) and the o/p H2 ratio ([\citeauthor=flower:op-h2] [\citeyear=flower:op-h2]). Normally, these parameters are very hard to constrain by observations because of other competing effects. The centres of pre-stellar cores thus form a unique laboratory to study basic physical parameters of interstellar gas.

In most radio observations, the lines are spectrally resolved, and the line profiles can be used to extract additional information about the source. A prime example is the double-peaked line profile of H2D+ toward the pre-stellar core LDN 1544 ([\citeauthor=vdtak:l1544] [\citeyear=vdtak:l1544]). The central absorption dip implies a gradient in the excitation of H2D+, which means an increasing density and a constant gas temperature. Previous models with a constant density at the centre and a centrally decreasing gas temperature are ruled out by the new H2D+ observations. Furthermore, the narrowness of the absorption from the very light H2D+ molecule implies that radial motions are subthermal in the outer parts of the core but increase inward. Maps of H2D+ and D2H+ emission will provide further constraints on the structure and kinematics of pre-stellar cores (Vastel, these proceedings).

Future directions

The next 5-10 years will bring several new facilities for (sub-)millimetre observations of H2D+ and D2H+. Specifically, the APEX telescope can observe the H2D+ 372 GHz line about ten times faster than the CSO (Belloche et al., in prep.). Its recently commissioned CONDOR receiver for Terahertz frequencies enables us to observe the 1370 GHz line (Emprechtinger & Wiedner, this conference). The D2H+ molecule may be observed through its 692 GHz line with the CHAMP heterodyne array receiver, while its 1477 GHz line can be reached with CONDOR. Ultimately, the ALMA interferometer will provide sensitive high-resolution images of the H2D+ 372 GHz and D2H+ 692 GHz lines.

At mid-infrared wavelengths, higher spectral resolution observations (such as offered by CRIRES on the VLT) will be crucial to obtain velocity-resolved profiles of the H+3 absorption. Velocity information is crucial to distinguish intrinsic absorption from intervening clouds, and will improve the accuracy of estimates of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate. Observations of H2D+, D2H+ and D+3 mid-infrared absorption lines would allow much more direct probes of the H2D+/H+3 ratio. First attempts were unsuccessful but did result in the serendipitous infrared detection of formaldehyde ([\citeauthor=roueff:h2co] [\citeyear=roueff:h2co]).

Theoretical calculation of the rate coefficient of de-excitation of H2D+ in collisions with H2 would greatly improve the accuracy of estimates of the H2D+ abundances in pre-stellar cores and star-forming regions. Such calculations are challenging because of the reactive nature of the interaction, but the He-H2D+ system may be a useful starting point.

In summary, H+3 is great, but using it as an astrophysical tool requires other molecules too. The future will bring excellent observing facilities to carry out such observations.
