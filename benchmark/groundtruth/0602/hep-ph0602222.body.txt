Introduction :

A typical electrodynamic plasma of interest in astrophysics [\cite=me.1], consists of electron, positron and photons (e, e+, γ) at thermodynamic equilibrium. Since it is a plasma medium, individual particle properties are modified by collective effects of plasma. One way to take account of this effect, is to use quasi-particle model. Just like in Debye theory of specific heat or theory of liquid helium etc. thermal properties of the medium may be viewed as a result of thermal excitations or quasi-particles, like plasmons and dressed photons as a result of quantization of plasma waves and electromagnetic waves in plasma. The standard procedure is to obtain the classical dispersion relations for plasma or electromagnetic waves in plasma and on their quantization, we get quasi-particles, namely quasi-fermions corresponding to e, e+ and quasi-bosons like dressed photons. We study the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of such a system of quasi-particles. One such study was attempted by Medvedev [\cite=me.1] which we modify and correct it to get the present model and then generalize it to quark gluon plasma (QGP).

QGP is a plasma made up of quarks and gluons [\cite=qgp.1], governed by strong interaction called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is similar to (e, e+, γ) system with electrons (positrons) are replaced by quarks (antiquarks) and photons by gluons. QED (quantum electrodynamics) is replaced by QCD. QGP also exhibits collective behaviour and hence the thermodynamic properties of QGP are modified and may be studied using quasi-particle model. Of course, this kind of study was first attempted by Peshier et. al. [\cite=pe.1] and latter it was modified with corrections and studied various groups [\cite=pe.2]. However, initially, these models were thermodynamically incosistent [\cite=go.1] and also not self-consistent in calculating the thermodynamics (TD) and quasi-particle properties. Few attempts were done to correct these inconsistency [\cite=go.1] [\cite=pe.2] by reformulating statistical mechanics (SM). However, in Ref. [\cite=ba.1], we have developed TD consistent model of QGP without reformulating SM. Here, in this new model, all previous problems of quasi-particle model, namely TD inconsistency and self-consistency, are solved.

Quasi-particle model of plasma :

Both the systems we discussed are highly relativistic and hence we develop here quasi-particle model for such ultra-relativistic systems. We assume that the collective excitations of plasma leads to a system of non-interacting quasi-fermions and quasi-bosons, obeying Fermi and Bose statistics respectively. Following the standard statistical mechanics [\cite=pa.1], density of quasi-particles may be written as,

[formula]

where z is the fugacity, ∓   refers to Bosons and Fermions. gf is the degenarcy associated with the internal degrees of freedom. Here εk is the energy of quasi-particle which may be obtained from classical approximate dispersion relation as,

[formula]

for Bosons and

[formula]

for Fermions. These forms of energy-momentum relations are widely used in quasi-particle models of QGP [\cite=pe.1] [\cite=pe.2] with ω2p replaced by temperature dependent masses, which they obtain from the finite temperature field theory calculations in ideal thermal bath. The general expressions for εk are very complicated even at high momentum limit and following Medvedev [\cite=me.1], we approximate them to above simpler equations with an error of about 3%. c is the speed of light and [formula] is the Planck constant. ωp is the plasma frequency, given by,

[formula]

for (e, e+, γ) system. e is the charge and ne the electron density which is also equal to positron density for a system with chemical potential equal to zero. In quasi-particle models, by definition, electron density is same as that of quasi-electrons. T is the temperature of the system.

(e, e+, γ) system:

Let us first consider (e, e+, γ) system with chemical potential zero, or z = 1, and the density of quasi-electrons is,

[formula]

which may be rewritten as

[formula]

The density of positrons is same as that of electrons. Similarly, the density of quasi-photons may be written as,

[formula]

where the fugacity is one for photons. These equations need to be solved self-consistently because ne which is to be determined is inside the integral through ωp. Redefining the variables, the final equation to be solved self-consistently is,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

α is the fine structure constant and K is the modified Bessel function. Once we know ne or f2e, we can obtain photon density from the relation,

[formula]

which follows from the Eq. ([\ref=eq:np]). Similarly, energy densities are given by, '

[formula]

or

[formula]

in terms of modified Bessel functions K, for electrons and

[formula]

or

[formula]

for photons. The blackbody Planck's distribution may be easily read from above equations as

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus the Planck's distribution is modified for the non-zero value of ā due to plasma with a cutoff frequency related to plasma frequency.

On taking a limit a  →  0 in Eq. ([\ref=eq:ne], [\ref=eq:np]), we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ζ(3) is a Riemann zeta function and has a value approximately 1.2 and η(3) is related to ζ(3) as [formula]. Hence the ne and nγ are related as [formula] as expected for ideal gas. Note that in the earlier calculations, [\cite=me.1], the starting point of the formalism is [formula], which is not right and such a relation is for energy densities. Secondly, it is an ideal gas relation which need not be true for non-ideal system that we are discussing. Here in our model we don't use such relations between ne and nγ, rather both of them are calculated self-consistently by solving the coupled integral equations, Eq. ([\ref=eq:ne], [\ref=eq:np]),

Other thermodynamic functions, like pressure may be obtained from the thermodynamic relation

[formula]

which on integration gives [formula], same as that of ideal relativistic gas. Again this result also differs from Ref. [\cite=me.1] where their expression for pressure is not valid for massive particles. It is interesting to look at the expression for plasma frequency,

[formula]

where we took [formula]. It is very close to [formula], obtained from the finite temperature field theory calculations, but note that it is not exactly equal because of our self-consistent calculations.

Quark gluon plasma:

From above discussion on (e, e+, γ) system. it is clear, in contrary to earlier work [\cite=pe.1] [\cite=pe.2] [\cite=go.1], one need to study QGP self-consistently in quasi-particle model. QGP is expected to form in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions and may exist in astropysical objects like neutron star, early universe etc. [\cite=qgp.1]. The lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulation of QCD predicts such matter, but seems to be non-ideal plasma near to the transition temperature from hadrons to QGP. To explain this behaviour many phenomenological models, based on QCD and plasma, have been proposed and quasi-particle model is one of them. As we discussed in the introduction, many of quasi-particle models [\cite=pe.1] [\cite=pe.2] [\cite=go.1] lack self-consistency in calculating the quasi-particle mass and the thermodynamic properties.

Let us consider, as an example, gluon plasma. The expression for gluon density, which is to be solved self-consistently, reduces to

[formula]

where fg is similar to fγ discussed earlier. Once we know fg, energy density may be evaluated from the relation,

[formula]

expressed in natural units and gg  =  16 for gluons. Note that, in QGP, gluons also carry charge and hence exhibits plasma oscillations even in the absence of quarks. Therefore, in pure gluon plasma, plasma frequency depends on gluon density. In QGP, it depends both on quark density and gluon density. Hence for gluon plasma we take ω2p  =  a  ng / T with [formula] such that [formula]. αs is the QCD running coupling constant. a0 is a constant, equal to 8  π / 3 for (e, e+, γ) system, but here we determine it by demanding that [formula] as T  →    ∞  , a perturbative finite temperature field theory result. So we get a0  ≈  2.15. For constant ā or αs, [formula] and hence an ideal equation of state (EoS). However, LGT results show a modification of T4 law near the transition temperature Tc and they actually used temperature dependent 2-loop order αs(T). Hence, we also consider similar expression to model αs(T), given by,

[formula]

where ΛT is a parameter related to QCD scale parameter. nf, the number of flavors, is zero in pure gluon plasma to be compared with LGT results. ΛT is the only parameter of our model to be found by fitting with LGT result. Once we know εg(T), it is stright forward to get pressure P(T) by integrating the thermodynamic relation Eq. ([\ref=eq:ep]) and then all other thermodynamic quantities may be obtained.

Results :

For (e, e+, γ) system we recalculated various thermodynamical quantities, reported in Ref. [\cite=me.1], using our model with proper corrections. The departure of these quantities from that of ideal system is too small to be noticed and tabulated in Table 1. Planck's distribution in plasma is plotted in Fig. 1 along with the Planck's distribution in the absence of plasma. Qualitatively similar results as in Ref. [\cite=me.1] with cutoff in the distribution etc. But, note that, the numerical values differ and our values listed in Table 1 with plasma are smaller than without plasma. Where as in Ref. [\cite=me.1] just the opposite, seems to be a numerical error.

When we apply our self-consistent quasi-particle model to QGP, as an exmple gluon plasma, we can explain very nicely lattice gauge theory (LGT) [\cite=ka.1] results as shown in Fig. 2, using a single parameter [formula]. The self-consistently calculated plasma frequency is [formula] g2 T2 at T  =  5  Tc, instead of [formula] used in all other quasi-particle models [\cite=pe.2]. It is interesting to notice that it is close to the value we used in our earlier thermodynamically consistent quasi-particle model [formula], [formula].

Conclusions :

We formulated a new self-consistent quasi-particle model to describe the thermodynamics (TD) of relativistic plasma, like (e, e+, γ) and QGP. Basic idea is that because of the collective behaviour of plasma, TD of such a system may obtained by studying the TD of quasi-particles which are thermally excited quanta of plasma and electromagnetic waves in plasma. This is equivalent to a system of bosons and fermions with mass propotional to plasma frequency. Plasma frequency depends on the density, a TD quantity, which we want to find out and hence a self-consistent problem to be solved. Note that, in all earlier quasi-particle models of QGP [\cite=pe.1] [\cite=pe.2], this self-consistency is not taken into account. In addition they have problems of TD inconsistencies etc. and as a result of both problems, they need more than two parameters to fit the LGT results. Further extension of this model to QGP with finite number of quark flavors, with and without chemical potential, may be future interesting problem.

As long as (e, e+, γ) system, studied earlier by Medvedev [\cite=me.1], is concerned, we modified his result with corrections in our new approach and obtained qualitatively the same results, but the numerical values and the sign of the modifications due to plasma are different.
