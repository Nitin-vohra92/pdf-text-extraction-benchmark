Introduction

In this paper we exploit the latest accurate data on planetary orbit determination [\cite=pitSSR] in order to constraint the amount of dark matter present in the Solar System. To avoid possible misunderstandings, here we are not intending the amount of dark matter at the Solar System's position in the Galaxy; we are, instead, dealing with possible excess of dark matter above the galactic background density. Such excess is to be intended as coming from dark matter gravitationally bound to the Solar System and partly from dark matter in the galactic halo focused by the solar gravitational potential.

Let us consider a distribution with spherically symmetric density ρdm(r). The corresponding modification to the Newtonian gravitational potential can be cast in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the total mass of dark matter enclosed in a spherical region of radius r. In regard to the distribution of the dark matter, it is believed it comes from diffusion into the Solar System (or possibly it was already present when our planetary system was formed). Diffusion was studied, e.g. in [\cite=pippo] [\cite=pluto], but it turns out that in none of these papers the density distribution in the Solar System has been derived in a form suitable for the present paper. Thus, we will make the simplest choice, i.e. we will consider ρdm as constant. With this assumption μ = (4 / 3)πρdmr3 and eq. ([\ref=udm]) becomes

[formula]

From it an entirely radial acceleration

[formula]

occurs. Its effect on planetary motions, which is, of course, much smaller than usual Newtonian gravity, can straightforwardly be calculated within the usual perturbative schemes.

The impact of a spherically symmetric distribution of dark matter on the planetary orbits

The Gauss equations for the variations of the semimajor axis a, the eccentricity e, the inclination i, the longitude of the ascending node Ω, the argument of pericentre ω and the mean anomaly M of a test particle in the gravitational field of a body M are

[formula]

in which n = 2π / P is the mean motion, P is the test particle's orbital period, f is the true anomaly counted from the pericentre, p = a(1 - e2) is the semilactus rectum of the Keplerian ellipse, Ar, At, An are the radial, transverse (in-plane components) and the normal (out-of-plane component) projections of the perturbing acceleration [formula], respectively, on the frame [formula] comoving with the particle.

If the perturbing acceleration is entirely radial, as it is the case for eq. ([\ref=ADM]), the Gauss equations reduce to

[formula]

As a result, the inclination and the node are not perturbed by such a perturbing acceleration.

By evaluating eq. ([\ref=ADM]) on the unperturbed Keplerian ellipse

[formula]

inserting it into ([\ref=smax2])-([\ref=manom2]) and averaging them with

[formula]

one gets that only the argument of pericentre and the mean anomaly are affected by extra secular precessions

[formula]

As a consequence, also the mean longitude λ  =  Ω  +  ω  +  M, which is used for orbits with small inclinations and eccentricities as those of the Solar System planets, is affected by an extra secular rate

[formula]

Confrontation with the latest data

The longitudes of perihelia

The obtained expressions are useful for comparison with the latest data on planetary orbits from the EPM2004 ephemerides [\cite=pitSSR]. A similar analysis was conducted in [\cite=KhriPit] by exploiting the determined extra-advances [formula] of the longitudes of perihelia ϖ of the inner planets [\cite=pitAL]. By using the uncertainties [formula] released in [\cite=pitAL], the authors of [\cite=KhriPit] obtained an upper bound on ρdm of 10- 17 g cm- 3 from Mercury and of 10- 19 g cm- 3 from the Earth and Mars. Note that eq. ([\ref=dodt]) yields for the perihelion advance, in units of 2π, after one full orbital revolution the same expression (5) of [\cite=KhriPit], apart from the eccentricity factor. Moreover, the constraints on ρdm obtainable for each planet separately with eq. ([\ref=dodt]) and the results of [\cite=pitAL] fully agree with those of [\cite=KhriPit]. However, the following concern about the reliability of the estimates by the authors of [\cite=KhriPit] is in order. The extra-perihelion advances determined in [\cite=pitAL] are affected, in general, by all the Newtonian and non-Newtonian features of motion which have not been accounted for in the dynamical force models of EPM2004. Among them there are certainly the totally umodelled general relativistic gravitomagnetic field, which induces the Lense-Thirring planetary precessions, and the solar quadrupole mass moment J2 which, instead, was included in EPM2004, but it is currently affected by a ~  10% uncertainty. For a discussion of such issues in a different context see [\cite=iorlt]. Each planetary perihelion is, thus, affected by such residual effects, so that it is not possible to entirely attribute the determined extra-advances to the action of the dark matter distribution, especially for Mercury. A better way to use [formula] is to suitably combine them in order to make the estimate of ρdm independent, by construction, of the Lense-Thirring and J2 effects. According to the approach followed in [\cite=iorlt] [\cite=ioraa], it is possible to construct the following combination

[formula]

with c1 =  - 80.7 and c2 = 217.6. The dimensionless coefficients c1 and c2, which are built up with a,e and i of the planets adopted, cancel out, by construction, the impact of the gravitomagnetic field and of the solar quadrupolar mass moment on the combination eq. ([\ref=combi1]). This can straightforwardly be checked by combining the perihelion precessions due to J2 and to the Lense-Thirring force with the coefficients of eq. ([\ref=combi1]): the result is zero. The upper bound on ρdm obtainable from eq. ([\ref=combi1]) can conservatively be obtained from

[formula]

it amounts to 4  ×  10- 19 g cm- 3.

The mean longitudes

Here we compare the shifts in λ obtainable from eq. ([\ref=dldt]) with the formal errors in fitting the mean longitudes at epoch of all the nine major planets by using a data record spanning 90 years from Table 4 of [\cite=pitSSR]. Our results are in Table [\ref=tavola]. As can be noted, the tightest constraint comes from Mars, with 5  ×  10- 22 g cm- 3. The present upper bounds are better than those obtained in [\cite=KhriPit] from the perihelia of each planet, even if we conservatively assume that the realistic errors in λ may be one order of magnitude larger than those released in [\cite=pitSSR]. In regard to the constraint from Uranus 3  ×  10- 20 g cm- 3, the previously obtained upper bound on ρdm from such a planet amounted to 10- 16 g cm- 3 [\cite=AndJPL]. From Table [\ref=tavola2] it can be noted that with a such high value of ρdm the periehelia and the mean longitudes of the outer planets of Solar System would undergo very huge secular precessions up to tens of arcseconds per century. Such anomalous effects would have certainly been detected, even in the case of the outer planets whose orbital determination relies almost entirely upon relatively inaccurate optical data [\cite=pitSSR].

However, caution is advised in considering the results of Table [\ref=tavola] for each planet separately. It is so not only for the same reasons already exposed in Section [\ref=perihl] about the unmodelled or mismodelled forces, but also because of the systematic errors [formula] in the Keplerian mean motions induced by the uncertainties in the semimajor axes. Following the approach of Section [\ref=perihl], we can write down the combination

[formula]

with k1 =  - 15.4 and k2 = 78.1. Also such a combination is independent of the solar Lense-Thirring and J2 effects. The formal errors in λ of Table 4 of [\cite=pitSSR], combined according to eq. ([\ref=combi2]), yields a conservative upper bound δρdm  ≤  7  ×  10- 21 g cm- 3. The errors in n, linearly combined according to eq. ([\ref=combi2]), yield a systematic bias δρdm  ≤  7.7  ×  10- 20 g cm- 3, so that a total upper bound δρdm  ≤  7.8  ×  10- 20 g cm- 3 can be obtained with the squared sum of these two kinds of errors. As can be noted, the use of eq. ([\ref=combi2]) yields better results that eq. ([\ref=combi1]).

Conclusions

In this paper we have worked out the effects that a local excess of dark matter in our Solar System over the galactic background would induce on the orbits of the planets. It turns out that, by modelling the dark matter distribution with a constant density, the longitude of perihelion and the mean longitude of a planet are affected by secular precessions. The comparison with the latest data show that the upper bounds obtainable from the mean longitudes and the perihelia are of the order of 10- 20 g cm- 3 and 10- 19 g cm- 3, respectively.
