It is well-known that the theory of q-Hermite polynomials is one of the main instruments for studying q-oscillators and their applications (see, for example, [\cite=Mac] [\cite=Bied]). In particular, q-difference equations for q-Hermite polynomials are known to be intimately connected with Hamiltonians of the corresponding systems.

The continuous q-Hermite polynomials are also related to the oscillator representations (a special case of the discrete series representations) of the quantum algebra suq(1,1), which are constructed with the aid of the creation and annihilation operators for the q-oscillator (see, for example, [\cite=KD]).

The aim of our paper is to study q-difference equations for the continuous q-Hermite polynomials for both cases when 0 < q < 1 and q > 1. The continuous q-Hermite polynomials for q > 1 are essentially different from those for 0 < q < 1.

The continuous q-Hermite polynomials of Rogers, Hn(x|q), 0 < q < 1, are orthogonal on the finite interval - 1  ≤  x: =  cos θ  ≤  1,

[formula]

with respect to the weight function (we employ standard notations of the theory of special functions, see, for example, [\cite=GR] or [\cite=AAR])

[formula]

These polynomials satisfy the q-difference equation

[formula]

written in a self-adjoint form [\cite=NSU]. The Dq in (3) is the conventional notation for the Askey-Wilson divided-difference operator defined as

[formula]

[formula]

In what follows we find it more convenient to employ the explicit expression

[formula]

for the Dq in terms of the shift operators (or the operators of the finite displacement, [\cite=LL]) e±  a  ∂θ  g(θ): = g(θ  ±  a) with respect to the variable θ. Although it is customary to represent q-difference equation for the q-Hermite polynomials in the self-adjoint form (3) (see [\cite=KS], p. 115), one may eliminate the weight function [formula] from (3) by utilizing its property that

[formula]

The validity of (6) is straightforward to verify upon using the explicit expression (2) for the weight function [formula].

Thus, combining (3) and (6) results in the q-difference equation

[formula]

[formula]

for the continuous q-Hermite polynomials Hn(x|  q), which does not explicitly contain the weight function [formula].

In connection with equation (7) it should be remarked that Koornwinder [\cite=K] has recently studied in detail raising and lowering relations for the Askey-Wilson polynomials pn(x;a,b,c,d|  q). We recall that the Askey-Wilson family for a = b = c = d = 0 is known to reduce to the continuous q-Hermite polynomials Hn(x|  q). So, as a consistency check, one may verify that (7) is in complete agreement with particular case of the equation D  pn  =  λn  pn (i.e., equation (4.5) in [\cite=K]) for Askey-Wilson polynomials with vanishing parameters a,b,c,d.

We are now in a position to show that equation (7) admits a factorization. Indeed, with the help of two simple trigonometric identities

[formula]

one can represent the left side of (7) as

[formula]

[formula]

The expression in square brackets factorizes into a product (D  qx  +  1)(D  qx  -  1) and the whole equation (7) may be written as

[formula]

where the q-difference operator D  qx is

[formula]

[formula]

To facilitate ease of clarifying the distinction between D  qx and the Askey-Wilson divided-difference operator Dq, defined by (4), one may also write (9) in the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and x =  cos θ, as before.

For various applications it is important that the Dq and [formula] are in fact lowering and raising operators, respectively, for the continuous q-Hermite polynomials Hn(x|  q) (see, for example, formulae (3.26.7) and (3.26.9) in [\cite=KS]). This circumstance enables one to interpret a Hilbert space of functions on

[formula]

(A  f)(x)=   ( e+ e)f(x)   cos(ln q ∂) f(x) . (11)

[formula]

D f(x) g(x) =  A f(x) D g(x) + D f(x) A g(x) .

[formula]

D = A  +  x D  . (12)

[formula]

〈 g,g 〉 =  g(x)   (x| q)  dx  , (13)

[formula]

D  H(x| q)     H(x| q) = q H(x| q) . (14)

[formula]

H(x| q)= (t e,t e;q)   (15)

[formula]

D  H(x| q)= D (t e,t  e;q)

[formula]

= ( q t e, q t  e;q) =   q H(x| q) .

h(x| q) = q h(x| q) ,    x=sinhφ , (20)
