OBSERVED PROPERTIES OF σ-PARTICLE

Introduction

Recently we found rather strong evidences for existence of the light σ-particle analyzing the experimental data obtained through both the scattering and the production process of I = 0 S-wave ππ system. In the preceding talk of this conference,[\cite=ref1] (which is referred as I in the following,) it was explained that our applied methods of the analyses are generally consistent with the unitarity of S-matrix. More specifically, the Interfering Amplitude(IA) method applied in reanalysis of ππ scattering phase shift satisfies the elastic unitarity, and the VMW method applied in analyses of ππ production processes is consistent with the final state interaction theorem. In this talk first I collect the values of our observed property of σ meson, its mass and width.

Then I show this observed property of σ is consistent with that to be expected in the linear σ model. Furthermore, I shall show, by investigating the background phase shift δBG theoretically in the framework of linear σ model, the experimental behaviors of δBG in both the I = 0 and I = 2 systems are quantitatively describable theoretically.

Observed property of σ meson

Reanalysis of ππ scattering phase shift    In the IA method the total phase shift δ00 is represented by the sum of component phase shift, δσ,δf0(980) and δBG. In the actual analysis the δBG was taken phenomenologically of hard core type:

[formula]

We analyzed the data of "standard phase shift" δ00 between ππ- and K[formula]-thresholds and also the data on upper and lower bounds reported so far (see ref.[\cite=ref2] in detail). The results of the analyses are given in Fig. 2 of I, and we concluded that the σ meson exists with the property,

[formula]

As explained in I, the fit with rc = 0 corresponds to the conventional analyses without the repulsive δBG. In the present analysis with δBG the greatly improved χ2 value 23.6 is obtained for standard δ00, compared with that of the conventional analysis, 163.4. The similar χ2 improvement is also obtained for the upper and lower phase shifts. This fact strongly suggests the existence of light σ meson phenomenologically. Analyses of ππ production processes    We also analyzed the data of ππ production processes, pp central collision experiment by GAMS and J / ψ  →  ωππ decay reported by DM2 collabration, and showed the possible evidence of the existence of the σ particle. In the analyses we applied the VMW method, where the production amplitude is represented by a sum of the σ, f0 and f2 Breit-Wigner amplitudes with relative phase factors. For detailed analyses, see ref. [\cite=ref2]. The obtained mass and width of σ are

Property of σ-meson and chiral symmetry

Now the property of σ meson obtained above is checked from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry. In the SU(2) linear σ model(LσM) the coupling constant gσππ of the σππ interaction is related to λ of the φ4 interaction and mσ as

[formula]

Thus, the Γσ is related with mσ through the following equation:

[formula]

Substituting the experimental mσ=535~  675 MeV given in Eq. ([\ref=eqexp]) and fπ=93 MeV into Eq.([\ref=eqmw]), we can predict Γtheorσ = 400  ~  900 MeV, which is consistent with the Γ expσ given in Eq.([\ref=eqexp]). Thus the observed σ meson may be identified with the σ meson described in the LσM.

Repulsive background phase shift

Experimental phase shift and repulsive core in the I=2 system    In our phase shift analyses of the I = 0 ππ system the δBG of hard core type introduced phenomenologically played an essential role. In the I = 2 ππ system, there is no known / expected resonance, and accordingly it is expected that the phase shift of repulsive core type will appear directly. As shown in Fig. 1, actually the experimental data[\cite=ref2] from the threshold to mππ  ≈  1400 MeV of the I = 2 ππ-scattering S-wave phase shift δ20 are apparently negative, and fitted well also by the hard-core formula [formula] with the core radius of r(2)c = 0.87 GeV- 1 (0.17 fm). Origin of the δBG     The origin of this δBG seems to have a close connection to the λφ4-interaction in LσM[\cite=ref2]: It represents a contact zero-range interaction and is strongly repulsive both in the I = 0 and 2 systems, and has plausible properties as the origin of repulsive core.

The ππ-scattering A(s,t,u)-amplitude by SU(2) LσM is given by A(s,t,u)  =  ( - 2gσππ)2 / (m2σ - s) - 2λ. Because of the relation ([\ref=eqrel]), the dominant part of the amplitude due to virtual σ production( 1st term) is cancelled by that due to repulsive λφ4 interaction( 2nd term) in O(p0) level, and the A(s,t,u) is rewritten into the following form:

[formula]

where in the last side the O(p2) Tomozawa-Weinberg amplitude and the O(p4) (and higher order) correction term are left. As a result the derivative coupling property of π-meson as a Nambu-Goldstone boson is preserved. In this sense the λφ4-interaction can be called a "compensating" interaction for σ-effect.

Thus the strong cancellation between the positive δσ and the negative δBG in our analysis leading to the σ, as shown in Fig. 2 of I, is reducible to the relation Eq.([\ref=eq:Acancel]) in LσM.

In the following we shall make a theoretical estimate of δBG in the framework of LσM. The scattering T matrix consists of a resonance part TR and of a background part TBG. The TBG corresponds to the contact φ4 interaction and the exchange of the relevant resonances. The main term of TBG comes from the λφ4 interaction. This TBG has a weak s-dependence in comparison with that of TR. The explicit form of TBG for I = 0 and I = 2 S-wave channels are given by

[formula]

where (a,b) = (1,2) for I = 0 and (a,b) = (0, - 1) for I = 2. Here we introduced the ρ meson contribution,which are supposed to be described by Schwinger-Weinberg Lagrangian, Lρ = gρρμ  ·  (∂μφ  ×  φ) - g2ρ / 2m2ρ (φ  ×  ∂μφ)2. In order to obtain δBG theoretically, we unitarize T by using the N/D method, TBG(s)I = eiδBG sinδBG  /  ρ1 = NIBG / DIBG. We take the Born term Eq.([\ref=eqB]) as N-function. In obtaining D-function one subtraction is necessary,

[formula]

We adopt the subtraction condition Re DIBG(m2σ)  =  1. The mσ is fixed with the value of the best fit, 0.585 GeV; and the values of mρ and gρ are determined from the experimental property of ρ meson; The obtained δI = 0,2BG is shown in Fig. 2. The s-dependence of the theoretical δBG by LσM including ρ meson contribution is almost consistent with the phenomenological δBG of hard core type.

Concerning on our analysis of δI = 0, Pennington made a criticism[\cite=ref4] that the form of δBG is completely arbitrary. However, as shown in Fig. 2, our phenomenological δBG, Eq.([\ref=eq2]), is almost consistent with the theoretical prediction by LσM. Thus, the criticism is not valid.

Concluding remark

We have shortly summarized the properties of the light σ meson "observed" in a series of our recent works. The obtained values of mass and width of σ satisfy the relation predicted by LσM. This fact suggests the linear representation of chiral symmetry is realized in nature. In our phase shift analysis there occurrs a strong cancellation between δσ due to the σ resonance and δBG, which is guaranteed by chiral symmetry. A reason of overlooking σ in conventional phase shift analysis is due to overlooking of this cancellation mechanism. The behavior of phenomenological δBG is shown to be quantitatively describable in the framework of LσM including ρ meson contribution.

Finally I give a comment: By the analysis of I = 1 / 2 S-wave Kπ scattering phase shift in a similar method, the existence of κ(900) particle with a broad (~  500 MeV) width is suggested. The scalars below 1 GeV, σ(600), κ(900), a0(980) and f0(980) are possibly to form a single scalar nonet.[\cite=ref5] Octet members of this nonet satisfy the Gell-Mann Okubo mass formula. Moreover, this σ nonet is shown to satisfy the mass and width relation of SU(3) LσM, forming with pseudoscalar π nonet a linear representation of chiral symmetry.
