Doi-Hopf Modules over Weak Hopf Algebras

e-mail: BGABR@rmki.kfki.hu Supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, OTKA - T 016 233

The category [formula] of Doi-Hopf Modules over the bialgebra H was introduced in [\cite=Doi] and independently in [\cite=Kop]. It is the category of the modules over the algebra A which are also comodules over the coalgebra C and satisfy certain compatibility condition involving H. The study of [formula] turned out to be very useful: It was shown in [\cite=Doi] [\cite=CMZ1] that many categories investigated independently before - such as the module and comodule categories over bialgebras, the Hopf modules category [\cite=Sw], and the Yetter-Drinfeld category [\cite=Y] [\cite=RT] - are special cases of [formula]. Using this observation many results known for module categories over bialgebras or Hopf algebras were generalized to this more general setting [\cite=CMZ2] [\cite=CIMZ].

In this paper we generalize the definition of Doi-Hopf modules to the case when H is a Weak Bialgebra (WBA). Our definitions are supported by the fact that many results of [\cite=Kop] [\cite=CMZ2] [\cite=CIMZ] remain valid in this case.

Weak Bialgebras (Weak Hopf Algebras - WHA's -) are generalizations of bialgebras (Hopf algebras) see [\cite=BSz] [\cite=BNSz] and [\cite=N] (latter one using somewhat different terminology). In contrast to another direction of generalization, the quasi-Hopf algebras and weak quasi-Hopf algebras, WBA's are coassociative. Though their counit is not an algebra map, their structure is designed such a way that their (left or right) (co-) module category carries a monoidal structure [\cite=N] [\cite=BNSz2] (and some more in the WHA case [\cite=BNSz2]).

WHA's have relevance for example in describing depth 2 reducible inclusions [\cite=NSzW].

As the bialgebra (Hopf algebra) also the WBA (WHA) is a self-dual structure: The dual space of a finite dimensional WBA (WHA) carries naturally a WBA (WHA) structure [\cite=BSz] [\cite=BNSz].

The paper is organized as follows: we define and examine the structures such as the weak Doi-Hopf datum (generalizing the Doi-Hopf datum of [\cite=Doi]) the weak Doi-Hopf module (generalizing the Doi-Hopf module of [\cite=Doi]) the weak smash product (generalizing the analogous notion of [\cite=Kop]) and the weak Doi-Hopf integral (generalizing definitions of [\cite=CIMZ] [\cite=Doint]). We illustrate these notions on the same four examples generalizing some classical examples of [\cite=Doi] [\cite=CMZ1].

In this Section H is a Weak Bialgebra (WBA) in the sense of [\cite=BNSz] over the field k. Its unit element is denoted by 1  1, the product of the elements g,h∈H by gh, the coproduct of h∈H by [formula] and the counit is denoted by ε.

Notice, that in contrast to the case when H is an ordinary bialgebra the unit preserving property of ρ and the counit preserving property of ·   are not required and the form of condition (b) in each group is somewhat different from the usual one.

Examples:

1 Let H be a WBA over k, A: = H as an algebra with the coaction ρ:  =  Δ, C:  =  HL with the coalgebra structure

[formula]

and the action aL  ·  h:  =  1  1(2)ε(aLh1  1(1)) for all aL∈HL,h∈H. Then (H,A = H,C = HL) is a non-degenerate right Weak Doi-Hopf datum.

2 Let H be a WBA over k, A:  =  HL as the subalgebra of H with the coaction ρ:  =  Δ|HL, C:  =  H as a coalgebra with the action c  ·  h:  =  ch for all c,h∈H. Then (H,A = HL,C = H) is a non-degenerate right Weak Doi-Hopf datum.

3 Let H be a WBA over k, A:  =  H as an algebra with the coaction ρ:  =  Δ, C:  =  H as a coalgebra with the action c  ·  h = ch for all c,h∈H. Then (H,A = H,C = H) is a non-degenerate right Weak Doi-Hopf datum.

4 Let K be a WHA over k, [formula] as a bialgebra. (Kop is the bialgebra with the same coalgebra structure as K and the opposite algebra structure.) A: = K as an algebra with the coaction [formula] for all a∈K, C:  =  K as a coalgebra with the action [formula] for all [formula]. Then [formula] is a non-degenerate right weak Doi-Hopf datum.

Let us call a (left or right) weak Doi-Hopf datum finite dimensional if all H,A and C are finite dimensional as k-spaces. There is a well defined notion of duality for finite dimensional weak Doi- Hopf data sending a left weak Doi-Hopf datum to a right one and vice versa:

Introduce the following notations: For any finite dimensional k- space M let [formula] denote the dual k-space. If A is a finite dimensional algebra then by Â we mean the dual space equipped with the dual coalgebra structure. Similarly, for a finite dimensional coalgebra C denote the dual algebra by Ĉ and finally for a finite dimensional bialgebra H denote the dual bialgebra by Ĥ.

For a (non-degenerate) right weak Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C) the triple (Ĥ,Ĉ,Â) is a (non-degenerate) left weak Doi-Hopf datum - called the dual of (H,A,C) - with

[formula]

where [formula], {bi} is any basis in H and {βi} is the dual basis in Ĥ, φ∈Ĥ, â∈Â and [formula] for [formula].

Similarly, for a (non-degenerate) left weak Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C) the triple (Ĥ,Ĉ,Â) is a (non-degenerate) right weak Doi-Hopf datum - called the dual of (H,A,C) - with

[formula]

with the obvious notation. The above duality transformation is involutive.

Proof: The transformations ([\ref=dur]) and ([\ref=dul]) are obviously inverses of one other. One easily checks that ([\ref=a1p]) for (Ĥ,Ĉ,Â) is equivalent to ([\ref=c1]) on (H,A,C), ([\ref=a2p]) to ([\ref=c2]), ([\ref=a3p]) to ([\ref=c3]), ([\ref=c1p]) to ([\ref=a1]), ([\ref=c2p]) to ([\ref=a2]) and ([\ref=c3p]) to ([\ref=a3]).

The non-degeneracy of the weak coaction [formula] of Ĥ on Ĉ is equivalent to the non-degeneracy of the weak action of H on C while the non-degeneracy of the action of Ĥ on Â is equivalent to the non-degeneracy of the weak coaction ρ of H on A both in the left and right cases. 5pt width 5pt depth 0pt

The category [formula] has as objects the finite dimensional right weak Doi-Hopf modules M over the right weak Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C) and arrows [formula] which intertwine both the A-actions and the C-coactions:

[formula]

for all m∈M,a∈A.

Similarly, AM(H)C is the category of finite dimensional left weak Doi-Hopf modules over the left Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C).

Let us see what categories [formula] are in our earlier examples:

Let (H,A,C) be a finite dimensional right weak Doi-Hopf datum and (Ĥ,Ĉ,Â) its dual. Then the categories [formula] and ĈM(Ĥ)Â are equivalent.

Proof: Let us define the functor D:  →  ĈM(Ĥ)Â

[formula]

where M is an object and T an arrow in [formula], t means transposition of linear operators, [formula], [formula] for [formula], {ai} is a basis for A and {αi} is the dual basis for Â. One checks by direct calculation that D defines an equivalence functor. 5pt width 5pt depth 0pt

Let (H,A,C) be a non-degenerate right weak Doi-Hopf datum. Then the forgetful functor F:  →  MA has a left adjoint and [formula] has a right adjoint.

Proof: Our proof is consructive. Define G:MA  →   by

[formula]

for M an object and T an arrow in [formula], [formula].

The fact that G is a left adjoint of F is justified by the existence of unit and counit natural homomorphisms [formula] and [formula]. Define them as

[formula]

It is staightforward to show that [formula], and ρ is natural. The proof of δM∈(G(M),M)MA lies on the following

Let (H,A,C) be a non-degenerate right weak Doi-Hopf datum. Then for any c∈C and a∈A

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lemma] (ii) implies εC(c  ·  a<  - 1 >)a< 0 >  =  εC(c  ·  1A <  - 1 >)1< 0 >a and hence δM∈(G(M),M)MA. Naturality of δ is obvious.

One can proceed the same way in the case of [formula] using now Lemma [\ref=lemma] (i). Define Ĝ:CM  →   as

[formula]

for M an object and T an arrow in [formula], [formula].

The unit and counit natural homomorphisms [formula] and [formula] can be given by

One checks that ([\ref=smash]) makes A  #  Ĉ an associative algebra with unit element 1A < 0 >  #   [formula].

Let us see what algebras A  #  Ĉ are in our earlier examples.

Examples:

1 [formula] is isomorphic to H, the isomorphism being given by ι:A  #  Ĉ  →  H, [formula].

2 [formula] is isomorphic to Ĥ, the isomorphism being given by ι:A  #  Ĉ  →  Ĥ, [formula].

3 [formula] is isomorphic to the Weyl algebra or Heisenberg double [formula] [\cite=BSz] [\cite=BNSz], the isomorphism being given by [formula], [formula]. (In all of the examples [formula] denotes the Sweedler's arrow [\cite=Sw].)

4 [formula] is isomorphic to the (twisted) Drinfel'd double D(Kopcop)op (for its definition see the Appendix). The equivalence is given by ι:A  #  Ĉ  →  D(Kopcop)op, [formula].

Let (H,A,C) be a non-degenerate right weak Doi-Hopf datum such that C is finite dimensional as a k-space. Then the categories [formula] and MA  #  Ĉ are isomorphic.

Proof: We have the functor P:  →  MA  #  Ĉ

[formula]

for M an object and T an arrow in [formula], [formula].

If C is finite dimensional as a k-space then let {ci} be any basis for C and {γi} the dual basis for Ĉ and construct the inverse functor [formula] of P:

[formula]

for M an object and T an arrow of [formula], a∈A,m∈M.

Let (H,A,C) be a non-degenerate right weak Doi-Hopf datum where H is a weak Hopf algebra with antipode S, F:  →  MA the forgetful functor, G its left adjoint as in Proposition [\ref=adj]. V be the k-space of the natural homomorphisms [formula], called the space of integrals for the weak Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C). We have a straightforward generalization of Theorem 2.3 of [\cite=CIMZ]:

The space V is isomorphic to the space V4:

[formula]

Furthermore the isomorphism f4:V  →  V4 takes ν∈V to a normalized element of V4 i.e. to an element γ∈V4 such that γ(c(1))(c(2)) = εC(c  ·  1A <  - 1 >)1A < 0 > if and only if ν is a splitting of the unit natural homomorphism [formula].

The relevance of the existence of normalized elements in V4 is discussed in [\cite=CIMZ].

Let us turn to the investigation of the space of integrals over the weak Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C) in our earlier examples. In doing so we make the additional assumption in the Examples 2 and 3 on H and in 4 on K to be a Frobenius WHA. Under this additional condition we identify the space of integrals for the weak Doi-Hopf datum (H,A,C) with certain subspace of the smash product algebra A  #  Ĉ. Also the normalization condition is formulated as a relation in the algebra A  #  Ĉ.

In all of the examples r be a non-degenerate right integral in H and ρ the dual right integral [\cite=BNSz] in Ĥ.

Examples:

1 The space of Doi-Hopf integrals over (H,A,C) is isomorphic to V0:  =  CenterH. Construct the isomorphism f:V4  →  V0 as

[formula]

The unique normalized element of V0 is the unit element 1  1 of H.

2 The space of the Doi-Hopf integrals is isomorphic to [formula], the commutant of the right subalgebra in Ĥ. Let us construct the isomorphism f:V4  →  V0 as

[formula]

for all h∈H.

An element ξ∈V0 is normalized if

[formula]

holds in Ĥ.

The space V0 is not isomorphic to the space IL(Ĥ) of left integrals in Ĥ. It is its subspace ĤL which is isomorphic to IL(Ĥ) via the isomorphism g:IL(Ĥ)  →  ĤL, [formula]. It is but true that the existence of normalized elements in IL(Ĥ) and V0 are equivalent.

3 The space of the Doi-Hopf integrals is isomorphic to [formula], the commutant of H in the Weyl algebra. The isomorphism f:V4  →  V0 is given by

[formula]

with the help of the basis {bi} of H and the dual basis {βi} of Ĥ.

The element w∈V0 is normalized if

[formula]

holds in the Weyl algebra [formula].

4 The space of the Doi-Hopf integrals is isomorphic to V0:  =  {u∈D(Kopcop)op| [formula]. The isomorphism f:V4  →  V0 is given by

[formula]

with the help of the basis {bi} of H and the dual basis {βi} of Ĥ.

u∈V0 is normalized if

[formula]

holds in the double D(Kopcop)op.

For the convenience of the reader we give here the generalization of the double construction due to Drinfel'd [\cite=Dr] and of the corresponding theory of Yetter-Drinfel'd modules [\cite=Y] [\cite=RT] to WHA's.

Notice that if H is also a WHA then ([\ref=YD]) can be replaced by the single relation

[formula]

By the category YD(H) we mean the category with objects the finite dimensional right Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over H and arrows [formula] intertwining both the H-module and the H-comodule structures of M and [formula].

If H is a finite dimensional WHA then by our Proposition [\ref=cateq] and Example 4. the category YD(H) is equivalent to the category of the right modules over the WHA D(H) hence carries (among others) a monoidal structure [\cite=BSz] [\cite=BNSz]. It is not so obvious however that it is true for any WBA H:

Let H be a WBA over the field k. Then the category YD(H) has a monoidal structure.

Proof: Our proof is constructive. For two objects M,N and arrows T,S of YD(H) let

[formula]

with [formula]. The monoidal unit is

[formula]

for aL∈HL,h∈H.

The reader may check using some WBA calculus that all M  ×  N and HL are Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over H if M and N are.

In order to prove that HL is a monoidal unit for the category YD(H) one has to construct the invertible intertwiners uLM∈(M,HL  ×  M)YD(H), uRM∈(M,M  ×  HL)YD(H) satisfying the triangle identities [\cite=McL] and being natural in M. They are as follows:
