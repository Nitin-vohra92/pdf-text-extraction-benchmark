Introduction

In a previous communication[\cite=r1] it was argued that Fermions would exhibit Bosonization effects below the Fermi temperature. The arguments were corraborated by considerations from Quantum Field Theory and a recent model that describes Fermions as Kerr-Newman type Black Holes, bounded by the Compton wavelength. To put it briefly, at low temperatures or length scales far greater than the Compton wavelength, the Fermion character would get blurred and we would have a semionic behaviour. These arguments are pushed further so that we obtain a justification for the semionic behaviour on the one hand and an alternative explanation for the Cooper pairs of superconductivity on the other. In the process we obtain an insight into low dimensional behaviour.

Fractal Charges and Cooper Pairs

In the context of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole type description of Fermions, it has been pointed out that the three dimensionality of space is intimately tied up with spin half and that each dimension contributes a charge e / 3 [\cite=r2] [\cite=r3]. Indeed in low dimensions, we encounter these fractional charges, as has been shown, starting with the work of Laughlin[\cite=r4] [\cite=r5] [\cite=r6]. Recently experiments with the Quantum Hall Effect confirm the e / 3 fractional charges[\cite=r7] [\cite=r8]. With this background we now observe that, the energy density ε below the fermi energy is given by

[formula]

where pF is the Fermi momentum and TF is the Fermi temperature. Let us compare ([\ref=e1]) with the result for n dimensions viz., [\cite=r9] [\cite=r10]

[formula]

We conclude that the assembly behaves as if it has the fractal dimensionality 1.5. (We will come to the low dimensional Bosonization in the next Section). For the moment we observe that with this dimensionality and the fact that the charge per dimension is e / 3 as noted above, the charge of the Fermions would be e / 2. The half charge would lead to a Cooper pair type scenario. One way to see this is, in the case of a Coulumb potential for example [\cite=r11] the energy levels would be given by

[formula]

rather than

[formula]

as in conventional theory owing to the fact that the e2 of the electron is replaced by e2 / 4. Effectively n is replaced by 2n. Alternatively, if the fundamental ratio e2 / Gm2 where m is the mass of the electron, has to retain its value, then, the mass also would have to be halved. Either way effectively we encounter pairs of electrons which ofcourse have the usual Bosonic behaviour of superconductivity. Another way of looking at this is that below the Fermi temperature we have, as is well known,[\cite=r12]

[formula]

where 〈np〉 is the Fermionic occupation number and N is the number of particles. Integrating by parts and remembering that [formula] is, as is well known[\cite=r12] a delta function peaking at p  ≈  pF, (the fermi momentum), we have

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=e2]) differs from the usual theory in that its left side is half the usual value, again indicating the pairing of electrons.

Low Dimensional Behaviour

In [\cite=r1], it was argued that in one dimension the assembly behaves as if it were below the Fermi temperature, whatever be the temperature. Indeed this low temperature Quantum nature has recently been experimentally verified with carbon nanotubes [\cite=r13] [\cite=r14]. We can come to a similar conclusion in the two dimensional case also. In this case, for the Fermi temperature we can easily adapt the usual three dimensional theory (cf.ref.[\cite=r12]) to two dimensions to obtain

[formula]

where [formula] Now using the expression for total energy

[formula]

whence invoking a partial integration as in the previous Section we get

[formula]

which is the same as equation ([\ref=e3]). However in this case we have worked at an arbitrary temperature T. It may be mentioned that we encounter the Quantum behaviour and two dimensionality at the interface between two semiconductors. Indeed independant of the above considerations, is the fact that Fermions described in the Dirac equation in one and two dimensions display neutrino type behaviour as has been noted earlier[\cite=r1] [\cite=r15] [\cite=r16].
