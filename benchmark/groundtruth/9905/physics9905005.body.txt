The spectrum of D-brane charges in the Type IIB string theory compactified on AdSp + 2  ×  S8 - p is computed using the K-theory approach. The result differs from the corresponding result presented in the digest of Olsen and Szabo.

Introduction

D-branes play a significant role in supersymmetric string and field theories. Two of the most outstanding developments in this direction have been achieved: 1. The generalized AdS/CFT duality [\cite=1.], which relates the superconformal field theory on Dp-branes placed at the orbifold singularity and the Type IIB string theory compactified on AdSp + 2  ×  H8 - p ; 2. The K-theory approach to D-brane charges [\cite=2.] [\cite=3.], which identifies D-brane charges with elements of Grothendieck K-groups [\cite=4.] of horizon manifolds H8 - p .

In the present paper we use K-theory to compute the spectrum of D-brane charges in the Type IIB string theory compactified on AdSp + 2  ×  S8 - p. The result differs from the corresponding result presented in [\cite=5.].

D-brane charges

Let us equip the horizon S8 - p with the gauge bundle

The Steenrod classification theorem [\cite=6.] asserts that this bundle is characterized by the homotopy group π7 - p(U). Using the standard definition of the K-group [\cite=7.], we obtain

The exact homotopy sequence [\cite=7.]

where BU is the inductive limit of the manifold

The manifold (2) has the following interpretation in terms of D-branes [\cite=8.]. When 2N coinciding branes are separated to form two parallel stacks of N coinciding branes, their gauge symmetry U(2N) is spontaneously broken to U(N)  ×  U(N). This situation generically allows for the existence of gauge solitons.

D-brane charges take values in the K-groups (1). To compute K-groups (1), we use the Bott periodicity theorem [\cite=9.]. The spectrum of D-brane charges is recorded in Table 1.
