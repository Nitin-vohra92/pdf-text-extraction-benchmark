Abstract The formulation of Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity with matter in the Einstein frame is realized as Einstein gravity with dilaton and dilaton coupled matter. We calculate the one-loop 4d anomaly-induced effective action (EA) due to N dilaton coupled massless fermions on the time dependent conformally flat background with non-trivial dilaton. Using such (complete) effective action, the (fourth-order) quantum-corrected equations of motion are derived. One special solution of these equations representing an inflationary Universe (with exponential scale factor) and (much slower) expanding BD dilaton is given. Similarly, 2d quantum BD Universe with time-dependent dilaton is constructed. In the last case, the dynamics is completely due to quantum effects.

1. Brans-Dicke theory [\cite=will] represents one of the simplest examples of scalar-tensor (or dilatonic) gravities where the background is described by the metric and the dilaton. There are many motivations to discuss such a theory. First of all, the dilaton is an essential element of string theories and the low-energy string effective action (for a recent review, see [\cite=polch]) maybe considered as some kind of BD theory (with higher order terms). Second, dimensional reduction of Kaluza-Klein theories may naturally lead to BD gravity. Third, dilatonic gravities are expected to have such important cosmological applications as in the case of (hyper)extended inflation [\cite=la]. Note that recently there was some activity on the study of BD cosmologies with a varying speed of light [\cite=barrow]. Taking into account the renewed interest in scalar-tensor gravity (see ref.[\cite=FGT] for a review) it may be reasonable to investigate the quantum aspects of such theory. That will be the purpose of present Letter: We apply effective action formalism for the dilaton coupled matter and study quantum cosmology in matter-BD gravity.

2. Let us start from the standard Brans-Dicke 4-dimensional action in the Jordan frame:

[formula]

where φ is the Brans-Dicke (dilaton) field with ω being the coupling constant and SM is the matter action.

It has been argued (for a review, see [\cite=FGT]) that only the action in the Einstein frame is physically relevant. For this reason, we prefer working within this frame, performing the following conformal transformation

[formula]

and a redefinition of the scalar field

[formula]

Thus, the action in the Einstein frame reads

[formula]

where [formula] (for a recent review of dilaton status, see [\cite=Dick]).

Below, we consider the theory in the Einstein frame as physical theory, thus we omit the tildes in order to avoid confusion. As matter Lagrangian we take the one associated with N massless (Dirac) spinors, i.e.

[formula]

There is no problem to add other types of matter (say scalar or vector fields). The choice ([\ref=sd]) is made only for the sake of simplicity.

The action ([\ref=bde]) describes the Einstein theory with a scalar (dilaton) field and dilaton coupled spinor matter. Without matter, it may be also considered as a low-energy string effective action (EA) (even in the presence of some dilaton coupled matter).

Our purpose here will be to study the role of quantum effects associated with dilaton coupled spinors to cosmological problems in BD gravity. Assuming N sufficiently large (to allow for the large N approximation) one can neglect in such investigation the proper quantum gravity corrections. We shall make use of the EA formalism (for an introduction, see [\cite=BOS]). The corresponding 4d anomaly-induced EA for dilaton coupled scalars, vectors and spinors has been found in Refs. [\cite=NO] [\cite=NOS] [\cite=NNO] respectively.

Hence, starting from the theory with the action

[formula]

we will discuss FRW type cosmologies

[formula]

where dl2 is the line metric element of a 3-dimensional space with constant curvature Σ, namely k = 1 (Σ = S3), k = 0 (Σ = R3) or k =  - 1 (Σ = H3). As is well known, introducing the conformal time η by means of

[formula]

one gets a space-time which is conformally related to an ultrastatic space-time with constant curvature spatial section [formula], namely

[formula]

or

[formula]

with

[formula]

The computation of the anomaly-induced EA for the dilaton coupled spinor field has been done in [\cite=NNO], and the result, in the non-covariant local form, reads:

[formula]

where σ1  =  σ  +  Aφ / 3, the square of the Weyl tensor is given by [formula] and Gauss-Bonnet invariant is G = RμνρσRμνρσ - 4RμνRμν  +  R2. For Dirac spinors [formula], [formula].

Generally speaking, it should be noted that the complete one-loop EA is given by the anomaly-induced EA presented above, plus some conformally invariant functional which is the EA computed in the reference metric μν. In our case, this second term is rather trivial (actually, it is a k-dependent constant), being the EA of a free spinor field in an ultrastatic space-time with constant spatial section (for a discussion of such effective actions, see [\cite=Zerbini]).

For example, for the flat case (k = 0), μν  =  ημν, the Minskowski tensor. As a consequence, W gives the complete non-trivial EA!

For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the case k = 0. As a result, the EA becomes

[formula]

Here, V3 is the (infinite) volume of 3-dimensional flat space and [formula] and σ  =   ln a where a(η) is the scale factor.

The total one-loop EA may be written adding to W the classical action for k = 0:

[formula]

Note that the notations are the same as in Ref. [\cite=B] where similar dilatonic effects to quantum cosmology have been considered for N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. In that case, the dilaton appears as part of the conformal supergravity multiplet (classical background) and the corresponding terms in EA have a different form.

Let us write the equations of motion

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Combining Eqs. ([\ref=8]), one gets

[formula]

Of course, it is hopeless to find the general solution of Eqs. ([\ref=8]). However, we remind that there exists a well known solution in the absence of the dilaton, namely Einstein gravity with quantum matter. Such solution describes the inflationary Universe (see [\cite=star]); for a recent discussion of non-singular string cosmologies, see [\cite=Veneziano]. Having in mind such inflationary Universe solution, one can search for special solution of ([\ref=9]), with

[formula]

where H and H1 are some constants. Substituting Eq. ([\ref=10]) in ([\ref=9]), we obtain

[formula]

Hence, time-dependence and H-dependence decouple and one is left with a second order algebraic equation for H1. Its solution is

[formula]

From this equation one gets a quantum estimate for ω: [formula], x  >  3- 5 that is slightly bigger than the classical restriction x > 0. Notice that H1 is always negative for the minus sign, while for the plus sign it may be positive or negative depending on the value of BD parameter ω.

Before analyzing Eq. ([\ref=8]) with the Ansatz ([\ref=10]), let us check that for A = 0 and φ  =   one obtains the inflationary Universe solution. Indeed, using a(η) = 1  /  Hη in ([\ref=8]), it is easy to get

[formula]

Consider now the case of non-trivial dilaton φ  =  φ(η). Transforming back to the physical time t, one obtains the inflationary universe [\cite=star]. Indeed, from dt = a(η)dη and a(η) =   ±  1  /  Hη, one obtains a(t) = 1 / C exp (   ∓   Ht). Choosing the plus sign gives rise to the inflationary universe solution. In this case, [formula], namely the dilaton is expanding with time, but much slower than the scale factor.

Let us now use the Ansatz ([\ref=10]) and Eq. ([\ref=12]) in the first of the Eqs. ([\ref=8]), in order to find H2. To this aim, first we get

[formula]

Notice that according to estimations using Solar System experiments [\cite=will], ω > 500. As a consequence, for ω = 500 one gets [formula] (depending on the sign choice for H1). Hence, [formula] can be neglected in the above Equation.

Thus, from the first of Eqs. ([\ref=8]), one has

[formula]

As a result, one observes that the value of H2 is significally increased by the contribution associated with the dilaton!

Summarizing, we have found explicitly one special analytic solution describing Brans-Dicke non-singular Universe with a (much slower) expanding dilaton. It should be noted that this is a purely quantum solution which does not exist at classical level. Note also that when [formula] is very large, ω≃3 / 2 one can easily get another estimatations for H2 which depends now on the explicit choice of BD parameter ω. It comes mainly from dilaton.

3. Motivated by the 4-dimensional case, we may assume that the classical action in the Einstein frame for the 2-dimensional BD theory reads

[formula]

where A is a constant parameter of the 2d BD theory and the matter Lagrangian is the one of two-dimensional Majorana spinors:

[formula]

Let us neglect the classical matter contribution since we are interested only in the one-loop EA induced by the conformal anomaly of the quantum matter.

In two dimensions, the metric of the Universe may be written in the form

[formula]

Introducing again the conformal time one gets a conformally flat space-time,

[formula]

We also assume that the BD scalar field φ depends only on η.

Since the conformal anomaly for the dilaton coupled spinor is (see [\cite=NNO])

[formula]

where c = N  /  (12π), the anomaly induced EA in the local, non-covariant form reads

[formula]

Note that this is, up to a non-essential constant, an exact expression. The total one-loop effective action is S + W, i.e.

[formula]

where [formula] and V1 the (infinite) spatial volume. After integration by parts we obtain

[formula]

As we see, 2d Einstein theory is trivial. It has no dynamics associated with scale factor (but th edilaton has some dynamics from classical part). The whole dynamics (or cosmology) appears as a result of quantum effects.

The general solution for a(t) is a linear function of time plus a constant:

[formula]

For the dilaton we get

[formula]

In this case, the initial singularity at t = 0 seems to be absent (however, curvature is zero at all times). Note in this respect that previous attempts[\cite=cosm] to study quantum cosmology in 2d dilatonic gravity have been actually studied in the Jordan frame.

In summary, we presented the first consistent framework to study quantum BD gravity with matter in the Einstein frame. The main problem here was to find the effective action for dilaton coupled matter. We successfully constructed such effective action for conformally flat background with non-trivial dilaton (only the spinor case was discussed). That gave the possibility to investigate quantum BD cosmology. One 4d analytic solution found in this Letter describes non-singular (inflationary) Universe with exponentially growing scale factor and linearly growing dilaton. In 2d case dynamics is induced only by quantum effects and non-trivial cosmology maybe also constructed.

It would be very interesting to extend the results of this study in various directions. First of all, we searched for an explicit analytic solution of the equations of motion. Clearly, there exist many more solutions describing different types of BD cosmology (expanding, oscillating, etc). These solutions may be found numerically for different initial conditions chosen for the dilaton and the scale factor, and also for their derivatives. Another extension is related with the possibility to study in detail k = 1 or k =  - 1 quantum Universes as the corresponding effective action is derived in this work. These questions will be addressed in another place.
