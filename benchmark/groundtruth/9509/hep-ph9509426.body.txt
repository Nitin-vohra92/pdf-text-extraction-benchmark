In the ongoing quest for a quark-gluon plasma, experiments are being pursued using ever higher energies or masses in order to increase the lifetime of the system either by increasing the initial energy density or the size of the system. The probability of preparing a strongly interacting system that shows thermodynamical behaviour and therefore is treatable by well known thermodynamical or fluid dynamical methods increases with the size of the system. Recently, preliminary results were announced from the NA49 Collaboration [\cite=NA49_1] [\cite=NA49_2] [\cite=QM95] for Pb  +  Pb central collisions at 160 AGeV. The application of Bjorken's estimate [\cite=bjorken] of the initial energy density yields a value of 3 GeV / fm3[\cite=NA49_1]. Of course, this estimate which is based on the value of one single observable (the rapidity density of the transverse energy in the central region) is no substitute for a comprehensive hydrodynamical study that takes into account all available data on spectra and correlation functions for different particle species. In this paper we present results of the first analysis of Pb + Pb at 160 AGeV using relativistic fluid dynamics and assuming an equation-of-state containing a phase transition.

A fully three-dimensional solution of the hydrodynamical relativistic Euler-equations was obtained with the computer code HYLANDER [\cite=udo]. With this solution it is possible to reproduce [\cite=jan] simultaneously mesonic and baryonic rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of the S + S reaction at 200 AGeV [\cite=wenig]. Corresponding measurements had been performed by the NA35 Collaboration. Based on these fits to the measured spectra, predictions were made for Bose-Einstein correlation functions[\cite=bernd2] [\cite=bernd3]. Those predictions agree quantitatively with the measurements[\cite=QM95] [\cite=alber]. The model also reproduces the photon data for S + Au collisions at SPS energies[\cite=axel] and gives a simple explanation for the "soft-[formula] puzzle" [\cite=udo91] and the complex behaviour of the radii extracted from pion and kaon correlations and explained the difference in the extracted radii for pions and kaons in terms of a cloud of pions stemming from resonance decays, which surrounds the fireball (pion halo) [\cite=bernd2]. In this paper we pursue a similar description for Pb + Pb at 160 AGeV reaction.

HYLANDER uses an initial scenario located between the extremes of the Landau[\cite=landau] and the Bjorken[\cite=bjorken] initial conditions. One has to specify an equation of state and a set of parameters which describe the initial conditions. Our equation of state exhibits a first order phase transition at a critical temperature TC = 200  MeV (cf. ref.[\cite=redlich]).

In the following we briefly sketch the basic features of the model which was introduced in ref. [\cite=jan]. We assume that an initial reaction of two baryonic fluids leads to a deceleration of the two baryonic currents and to the spread of their width in momentum space. The kinetic energy is converted into internal excitation (thermal energy) of a third fluid which is created in the central region. The parameters determine the position of the maximum, the width in momentum space of the two baryonic fluids after the collision and the spatial extent of the central fireball. All other quantities are obtained from energy-momentum conservation (see table 1). The parameters are determined by fitting the pion rapidity spectrum; all other spectra are predictions of the model.

In Fig. 1a is shown the measured rapidity spectrum from the NA49 Collaboration [\cite=NA49_1] [\cite=NA49_2] of negative hadrons for Pb  +  Pb central collisions at 160 AGeV. In table 1 we show the parameter set and the related physical quantities of the initial fireball as described in ref. [\cite=jan] and compare them to the S + S case. The Pb + Pb system leads to a larger stopping than does S + S and this results also in the increase of the inelasticity in Pb + Pb compared to S + S.

In the following we discuss some of the results for the single- and double-inclusive spectra of hadrons and mesons. All calculations are based on thermal as well as on chemical equilibrium. In both types of spectra we include the effect of resonance decays. The influence of partial coherence [\cite=bernd3] will not be considered here. A detailed analysis Pb + Pb at 160 AGeV will be published in ref.[\cite=future].

Consistent with expectation the degree of stopping and thermalization is higher in Pb + Pb and the amount of thermal energy in the central fireball increases from 43% (S + S) to 65% (Pb + Pb). Due to the higher stopping, 73% of the baryons are located now in the central region compared to only 49% in the S + S case. The location of the maximum density of the two baryon currents ym in rapidity space is significantly shifted into the central rapidity region. It is important to note that the baryons for Pb + Pb are almost stopped. The resulting high baryonic density of 2.14 fm- 3 in the center and 3.2 fm- 3 in the forward region is three times higher than in S + S and can therefore no longer be neglected. It will have a strong influence on strangeness, photon and lepton production as well as on the relative meson abundancies.

The maximum lifetime of the fireball is increased from 6.9 fm / c (S + S) up to 14.5 fm / c for Pb + Pb. We observe approximately the same behaviour for the lifetimes of the QGP. Whereas in S + S the lifetime of the QGP was short (1.5 fm / c), in the Pb + Pb case a QGP persists for 3.4 fm / c . Taking into account that the initial volume of the Pb + Pb system is ~   eight times larger than in the S + S case, we note that the lifetime increases slower than does the volume. This effect is due to the cooling by transverse rarefaction waves which are only sensitive to the difference in the transverse radius which differs approximately by a factor two from S + S to Pb + Pb.

For Pb + Pb at 160 AGeV we find average values for the baryonic chemical potential 〈μB〉 = 363  MeV and for the strangeness chemical potential 〈μS〉 = 69  MeV using Tf = 139  MeV for the freeze-out temperature. As a result we obtain a chemical composition of 48.9% thermal (directly emitted) pions, 15.4% thermal kaons, 21.6% mesons (such as ρ, ω, η, [formula], ... etc.), 13.7% baryons (such as p, Δ, Σ, Λ, ... etc.) and 0.4% anti-baryons (such as ,, ... etc.). The detailed sub-fractions will be given in ref.[\cite=future]. The corresponding values for S + S at 200 AGeV are given in ref.[\cite=jan].

The calculation of single particle inclusive spectra with HYLANDER was extensively discussed in ref.[\cite=jan]. Fig. 1a shows our model predictions for negative thermal π- compared to all negative π. We stress that due to our choice of the freeze-out temperature of Tf = 139  MeV, there are large resonance contributions (40% - 50%) to the pionic spectra. The rest of our rapidity spectrum of negative hadrons h- is made up by contributions from negatively charged kaons. The K- spectrum consists mainly of directly emitted kaons; less than 10% come from the [formula] resonance.

The h- rapidity spectrum has been chosen to fit the NA49 data in such a way that the proton rapidity spectrum has the shape observed in the NA44 experiment[\cite=jacak]. Since it is not clear from the NA44 experiment to what extent Λ decays appear in the proton production, we show our results for the proton rapidity spectra with and without contributions from the Λ decay. Within these limits we reproduce the results for the NA44 proton rapidity spectra.

Transverse momentum spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. They were not involved in finding a parameter set for the fit of experimental data and are therefore predictions.

The calculation of Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) was performed using the formalism outlined in refs. [\cite=bernd2] [\cite=bernd3] [\cite=bernd1] including the decay of resonances. The hadron source is assumed to be fully chaotic. We present results for both pion and kaon BEC.

In the previous section we mentioned that in the case of pion interferometry we have to deal with a large fraction - 40% to 50% - of the pions originating from resonances. The effects of resonance decays on two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation functions are shown in Fig. 2. We show examples of correlation functions in the longitudinal and transverse directions. The K and q variables indicate our choice of [formula] and qμ = kμ1 - kμ2 to be the average and the relative 4-momentum of the particle pair with 4-momenta kμ1 and kμ2. The contributions from resonance decays are successively added to the correlation function of thermal π-.

By adding several interferometry contributions from resonance decays, the correlation functions become narrower reflecting a larger effective source size. We point out that the effect of the ω resonance is clearly visible within experimental resolution (~  5  MeV / c), although its lifetime τω is rather large (τω = 23.4  fm / c) compared to the spatial dimensions of the fireball. The decay of the ω resonance is also mainly responsible for the deviation of the functional shape of the correlation function from an approximately Gaussian shape. Another important feature of resonance decay effects is the appearance of η decays. Due to the very large lifetime (τη = 1.64  ×  105  fm / c) of the η resonance, the two-particle correlation function becomes so narrow that the result is a decrease in the experimental resolvable intercept to values below 1.80, depending on the experimental resolution (cf. [\cite=bernd3]).

In order to extract effective hadron source radii, we fit our results to the Gaussian form used by experimentalists (for the choice of the variables, cf., e.g. ref.[\cite=bernd3]):

[formula]

It should be emphasized that here λ does not represent the effect of coherence, but the effective reduction of the intercept due to the contributions from η decays.

Fig. 3a shows our predictions for effective radii [formula], Rside and Rout as functions of rapidity and transverse momentum of the pair, both for π-π- (solid lines) and for K-K- pairs (dashed lines). For comparison, we have also included the curves for thermally produced pions (dotted lines). In the case of interferometry of negative kaons, we checked that the [formula] resonance gives negligible contributions to the two-particle BECs. It is also seen that the direct (thermal) pions, which can barely be separated experimentally from the pions from resonance decay, show a very similar behaviour as do the radii extracted from kaon interferometry. It is again a confirmation that kaon interferometry probes the spatial and temporal characteristics of the fireball whereas pion interferometry probes the halo due to resonances.

The general features of the momentum-dependent effective radii which were presented in refs.[\cite=bernd2] [\cite=bernd3] for S  +  S at 200 GeV hold also for Pb  +  Pb at 160 AGeV. We stress four observations:

(i) In the case of pion interferometry, the resonance decays increase the effective radii by almost the same factors as for S  +  S at 200 AGeV (~  2.1 in the longitudinal and ~  1.4 in transverse direction).

(ii) The difference between the kaon and pion radii determines the size of the resonance halo. Its maximum extension is 5.6 fm in longitudinal direction, 2.4 fm in side- and 2.6 fm in out directions (compare corresponding values for S + S at 200 AGeV in table 1). The halo size in the longitudinal direction is larger because here we have stronger retardation effects due to the delayed resonance decay because of high fluid velocities.

(iii) We note that the Sinyukov-formula (cf. ref.[\cite=loerstadt]) fails to describe our results although it was derived from hydrodynamical assumptions. The reason for the difference is that Sinyukov's formula was obtained for a longitudinally expanding source which is better described in terms of the Bjorken scenario. In the case of Pb + Pb we have more stopping and thus a larger transverse expansion compared to S + S. For S  +  S at 200 AGeV we found a maximum transverse velocity [formula] whereas for Pb  +  Pb at 160 AGeV we obtain [formula]. Sinyukov's approach is therefore too rough, and this results in the deviations. It also suggests that it is dangerous to overstress the Bjorken approach because it can lead to misleading or inconsistent results.

(iv) The correlation functions are measurable with the experimental resolution of the detector setups. Even the influence of the ω should be visible.

In Fig. 3b we show our results for effective radii as a function of the average transverse momentum [formula] of the pair for all pions at yK = 4.5  -  ycm = 1.6. In particular, the effective longitudinal radii [formula] are evaluated in the longitudinal comoving system (LCMS) in order to make a comparison to preliminary NA49 measurements [\cite=QM95] possible. Our calculations agree surprisingly well with the data.

To summarize: we have shown that preliminary data of the NA49 Collaboration can be reproduced with a self-consistent three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic description assuming an equation of state with a first order phase transition. We have made predictions for rapidity spectra of pions, kaons and protons for Pb + Pb at 160 AGeV. Our data analysis indicates a stronger stopping and an enhanced transverse flow in the case of Pb + Pb collisions. The high baryon density in the central region will have a strong influence on the chemistry of the fireball and can no longer be neglected [\cite=future]. Models dealing with weak probes and particle abundancies need to take this into account.

Bose-Einstein correlation functions for pions and for kaons have also been predicted. It is important to note that in the case of the pion interferometry, the presence of a resonance halo increases the size of the fireball in the central region by factors ~  2.1 in longitudinal and ~  1.4 in transverse direction. The NA49 data on interferometry, which were presented in terms of inverse radii, are surprisingly well described.

The results of this work constitute further evidence that heavy-ion collisions in the SPS region show fluid dynamical behaviour and that the assumption of a first order phase transition from QGP to hadronic matter is necessary in order to reproduce the data as was first pointed out in [\cite=udo] and later confirmed by several independent groups [\cite=many].
