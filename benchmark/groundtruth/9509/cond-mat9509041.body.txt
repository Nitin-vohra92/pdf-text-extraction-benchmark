Abstract: The Bose-Einstein condensation of a dilute gas of rubidium-87 atoms was achieved by cooling a small number of atoms in a magnetic trap. The effective potential of the trap is to lowest order harmonic and under these conditions we estimate the critical temperature and the heat capacity of an ideal gas of Bose particles. Previously this has been estimated within the semiclassical approximation. However, because of the small number of atoms, the resulting Tc deviates slightly from our result obtained by exact numerical calculations. For the gap of the heat capacity at the transition point the deviation is 20%.

In the remarkable experiment[\cite=CORNELL] the rubidium vapor is magnetically trapped and evaporatively cooled below 170 nK where a finite fraction of the particles is observed to occupy the ground state. When further lowering the temperature this fraction increases abruptly, signaling a Bose-Einstein condensation. The gas is very dilute and hence well approximated by an ideal gas. The confining magnetic field is a time-averaged, orbiting potential[\cite=PETRICH] whose effective potential to first order is a three-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The Bose-Einstein condensation of an ideal gas in such a potential has been treated earlier in the semiclassical approximation[\cite=KLEPPNER]. We will first shortly review a part of this work using a slightly different approach leading to the same results.

The number of particles of an ideal Bose-gas is given by

[formula]

where N0 is the number of particles occupying the ground-state, μ is the chemical potential and the sum runs over all one-particle states. The semiclassical approximation consists of approximating this sum by the phase-space integral

[formula]

In our case the classical Hamiltonian is given by [formula] and the integral can be evaluated at the transition point where μ  =  N0  =  0. This gives the critical temperature

[formula]

where ζ(3)  =  1.202. Similarly the internal energy is given by

[formula]

The heat capacity C  =  ∂E / ∂T is seen to be a function of ∂μ  /  ∂T. The latter can be determined by taking the derivative of Eq.([\ref=Nint]) with respect to the temperature[\cite=KLEPPNER]. This enables us to calculate the heat capacity below and above Tc:

[formula]

The heat capacity is seen to exhibit a gap at the transition point, unlike the ideal gas confined in a box.

In the experiment the number of particles was N  =  20000 and the frequencies of the oscillators where given by ωz / 2π  =  120Hz and [formula]. Eq.([\ref=T_{c}]) then gives the transition temperature Tc  =  73.5 nK. However, in a recent preprint[\cite=BAYM] the frequency is corrected to ωz / 2π  =  208Hz, and will use this value in our numerical estimates. This frequency gives a transition temperature Tc  =  127.4 nK which is closer, but still not close to the observed transition temperature at about 170 nK.

To improve this method one may include interactions using the mean-field approach, leading to corrections dependent of the scattering length a[\cite=KLEPPNER], which for the rubidium gas is determined to be in the range 85a0  <  a  <  140a0, where a0 is the Bohr radius[\cite=GARDNER]. These corrections lowers the transition temperature to Tc  =  125.6 for a  =  110a0.

Another improvement is to go beyond semiclassical approximation which is valid just for kT  ≫  ω. In order to fulfill this requirement at Tc the number of particles must be quite large since kTc  /  ω  ~  N1 / 3. However, when ω is comparable to kT in size, the exact sum of Eq.([\ref=sum]) converges quite fast, and it is possible to evaluate the sum over the quantized oscillator-states numerically. Estimating the critical temperature in this way gives a 3% correction and Tc  =  123.4 nK. This correction is seen to be twice as large as the one due to interactions.

After determining Tc the internal energy and specific heat may be evaluated by replacing the phase-space integrals leading to Eqs.([\ref=C1]-[\ref=C2]) by a finite number of terms of the exact sums. This gives

[formula]

the latter differing 20% from the semiclassical result, mainly due to the shifted transition temperature.

The semiclassical approach thus turns out to be inaccurate when dealing with such a small number of particles and instead the exact quantum sums should be evaluated when calculating thermodynamic quantities. The estimated transition temperature deviates from the observed. Probably the dilute rubidium gas is well approximated by an ideal gas, at least before the condensation takes place. So the crucial point is how well the harmonic oscillator approximates the confining potential and if so, how accurate the oscillator strengths may be determined.
