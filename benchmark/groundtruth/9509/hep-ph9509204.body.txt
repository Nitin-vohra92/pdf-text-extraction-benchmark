Using the SU(3) flavour symmetry of strong interactions, we propose strategies for extracting both the CKM-angle γ and the   →  ūus̄ tree-level amplitude T'. We present also an approximate approach using the branching ratios for the modes B+  →  π+K0, B0d  →  π-K+, 0d  →  π+K- and B+  →  π+π0 which should be rather promising from the experimental point of view. The quantities γ and T' determined this way may well be used as an input to control electroweak penguins in nonleptonic B-decays as has been discussed in previous work. Following these lines, we propose strategies for obtaining quantitative insights into the physics of the electroweak penguin operators and performing some consistency checks. As a by-product, we derive an upper bound of [formula] for the uncertainty originating from electroweak penguins in the α-determination by means of B  →  ππ decays. Strategies for the determination of the angle γ in the unitarity triangle [\cite=ck] [\cite=js] are among the central issues of present particle physics phenomenology. Although there are already methods on the market allowing an absolutely clean measurement of this quantity (see e.g. refs. [\cite=gw]-[\cite=kay]), they are quite challenging for experimentalists. An interesting approach to measure both weak and strong phases by using SU(3) triangle relations among B  →  {ππ,πK,Kq} decays and making some plausible dynamical assumptions (neglect of annihilation topologies, etc.) was proposed last year by Gronau, Hernández, London and Rosner [\cite=grl]-[\cite=ghlrsu3].

Unfortunately, similar to the situation arising in certain nonleptonic B-meson decays [\cite=rfewp1]-[\cite=dy], electroweak penguins may have a considerable impact on this approach and may in particular preclude a clean determination of the CKM-angle γ [\cite=dhewp2] [\cite=ghlrewp]. In order to eliminate the electroweak penguin contributions, Gronau et al. have constructed an amplitude quadrangle involving B  →  πK decays [\cite=ghlrewp] that can be used in principle to extract γ. However, this approach is very difficult from the experimental point of view, since one diagonal of the quadrangle corresponds to the decay Bs  →  π0η which is expected to have a very small branching ratio at the O(10- 7) level. Recently, Deshpande and He have presented another SU(3)-based method [\cite=dhgam] which uses the charged B-decays B-  →  {π-q0,π0K-,ηK-,π-π0} and is unaffected by electroweak penguins as well. Although this approach is more promising for experimentalists - the relevant branching ratios are O(10- 5) - it suffers from η  -  η' - mixing and other SU(3)-breaking effects.

In a recent publication [\cite=bfewp], it has been shown that the   →  s̄ electroweak penguin amplitude [formula] can be determined from B  →  πK decays having branching ratios O(10- 5) if one uses the CKM-angle γ as one of the central inputs and makes some reasonable approximations. Since electroweak penguins are - in contrast to QCD penguins [\cite=bf] - dominated to a good approximation by internal top-quark exchanges, the   →  s̄ electroweak penguin amplitude can be related to the   →   amplitude [formula] by using the SU(3) flavour symmetry of strong interactions. The knowledge of [formula] allows in particular to investigate whether the uncertainty Δα in the Gronau-London-method [\cite=gl] of measuring the CKM-angle α introduced by electroweak penguin effects is really as small as is expected from theoretical estimates [\cite=dhewp2] [\cite=ghlrewp]. As we shall see below, an upper limit for this uncertainty is given by [formula].

In this letter we would like to discuss some other applications of the approach [\cite=bfewp] which allow quantitative insights into the physics of the electroweak penguin operators and provide interesting tests of the Standard Model of electroweak interactions [\cite=sm]. As the CKM-angle γ is one of the central ingredients of this method, let us begin our discussion by presenting a new strategy for extracting this quantity. To this end we consider the decays B+  →  π+K0 and B0d  →  π-K+. If we apply the same notation as Gronau, Hernández, London and Rosner in ref. [\cite=ghlrewp], the corresponding decay amplitudes take the form

[formula]

where T' describes the colour-allowed   →  ūus̄ tree-level amplitude, P' denotes   →  s̄ QCD penguins and [formula] is related to colour-suppressed electroweak penguins. Neglecting as in [\cite=bfewp] the colour-suppressed electroweak penguin contributions, we obtain

[formula]

where we have taken into account the relations

[formula]

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=e3]) arises from the special CKM-structure of the   →  s̄ penguins [\cite=bf] and that δP' and π are CP-conserving strong and CP-violating weak phases, respectively. In Fig. 1 we have represented ([\ref=e2]) graphically in the complex plane. Looking at this figure, which is a modification of Fig. 2 given in ref. [\cite=bfewp], implies that both the quantities [formula], [formula] and the CKM-angle γ can be determined from the measured branching ratios BR(B+  →  π+K0) = (B-  →  π-q0), BR(B0d  →  π-K+) and BR(0d  →  π+K-), if |T'| = |'| is known. This quantity can be determined by relating it to the   →  ūu colour-allowed tree-level amplitude T. Making use of the SU(3) flavour symmetry of strong interactions, one finds [\cite=ghlrsu3]

[formula]

where λ = 0.22 is the usual Wolfenstein parameter [\cite=wolf] and fK and fπ are the K- and π-meson decay constants, respectively, describing factorizable SU(3)-breaking. Unfortunately, non-factorizable SU(3)-breaking corrections to ([\ref=e5]) are completely unknown at present and therefore cannot be included. In view of these uncertainties, the neglect of the colour-suppressed electroweak penguins in ([\ref=e2]), which are expected to be suppressed by factors O(λ̄2) and O(λ̄) relative to the amplitudes P' and T', respectively, seems to be reasonable. The parameter λ̄  =  O(0.2) describes the hierarchy of the different topologies contributing to B  →  PP decays [\cite=ghlrsu3] [\cite=ghlrewp] [\cite=bfewp].

The quantity |T| can be extracted in principle in a clean way up to corrections of O(λ̄2) by applying the approach presented in [\cite=bfalpha]. There, a determination of the CKM-angle α by using mixing-induced CP violation in the decays Bd  →  π+π- and Bd  →  K0q0 has been proposed. As a by-product of this analysis, the quantity |T + E|, where E corresponds to an O(λ̄2)-suppressed exchange amplitude, is also fixed and can be used to determine |T'| through ([\ref=e5]). This approach is, however, quite difficult for experimentalists. Therefore, it is an important question to search also for methods of obtaining approximate information on |T| that can be realized more easily in practice.

Such an estimate of |T| can be obtained directly from the branching ratio for the decay B+  →  π+π0. In the notation of ref. [\cite=ghlrewp] its transition amplitude takes the form

[formula]

If we neglect both the colour-suppressed   →  ūu tree-level amplitude C and the very small electroweak penguin contributions, which should be suppressed relative to T by factors O(λ̄) and O(λ̄2), respectively [\cite=ghlrewp], we find

[formula]

This approximation is consistent with those performed in [\cite=bfewp] where the colour-suppressed   →  ūus̄ tree-level amplitude |C'| has also been neglected. Consequently, combining ([\ref=e5]) and ([\ref=e7]), the amplitudes z and [formula], which are essential for the determination of the   →  s̄ electroweak penguin amplitude [formula] as has been outlined in [\cite=bfewp], can be extracted from Fig. 1. Since the angle between these amplitudes is given by 2γ it can be fixed as well. This determination of γ is just an estimate and cannot be considered as a precision measurement. However, it should be rather promising from the experimental point of view because all involved branching ratios are O(10- 5). Moreover, it requires a quite simple geometrical construction, which is very similar to the original one suggested by Gronau, Rosner and London [\cite=grl], and is not affected by η  -  η' - mixing as the method for determining γ proposed by Deshpande and He [\cite=dhgam].

The quantities z and [formula] may well be used to obtain information on   →  s̄ electroweak penguins by following the approach presented in ref. [\cite=bfewp]. In this paper, different strategies for determining z and [formula] that can be used if the CKM-angle γ is known, for example by applying the absolutely clean method of Gronau and Wyler [\cite=gw], have also been discussed.

The scenario at future experimental B-physics facilities might be as follows:

In the [formula] generation of experiments it should be possible to estimate z, [formula] and γ by measuring the four branching ratios BR(B+  →  π+K0) = (B-  →  π-q0), BR(B0d  →  π-K+), BR(0d  →  π+K-) and BR(B+  →  π+π0) as we have proposed above. If one measures in addition the two branching ratios BR(B+  →  π0K+) and BR(B-  →  π0K-), the   →  s̄ electroweak penguin amplitude [formula] can be determined (see Fig. 1 given in [\cite=bfewp]). Note that all involved branching ratios are expected to be at the O(10- 5) level [\cite=kp] and that no time-dependent measurements are needed.

In the [formula] - or probably [formula] - generation of experiments the CKM-angle γ can hopefully be determined by using the absolutely clean methods of [\cite=gw]-[\cite=adk]. The knowledge of this angle would improve the determination of the electroweak penguin amplitude [formula] considerably as has been stressed in [\cite=bfewp]. In these experiments it will hopefully also be possible to implement the approaches [\cite=gl] [\cite=bfalpha] to determine the CKM-angle α in a clean way. The uncertainties of both methods, electroweak penguins and SU(3)-breaking in [\cite=gl] and [\cite=bfalpha], respectively, are expected to be of the same order, i.e. O(λ̄2), and should be rather small. In the case of the α-determination by means of B  →  ππ decays [\cite=gl], the electroweak penguin corrections can even be controlled in a quantitative way as has been shown in [\cite=bfewp]. Besides the extraction of α, the approach presented in [\cite=bfalpha] would also allow an independent determination of γ and z, [formula] as we have shown above. This would yield an interesting cross-check.

Let us now discuss some further applications of the approach to extract the electroweak penguin contributions to nonleptonic B-decays presented in [\cite=bfewp]. They can be divided into two categories:

quantitative insights into the physics of the electroweak penguin operators

consistency checks.

In order to work out point i), we shall use a low energy effective Hamiltonian describing |ΔB| = 1, ΔC = ΔU = 0 transitions. In the case of b  →  s decays, the ΔB =  - 1 part can be written in the form [\cite=bjl]

[formula]

where Qk are local four-quark operators and Ck(μ) denote so-called Wilson coefficient functions that have been calculated by Buras et al. [\cite=bjl] in renormalization group improved perturbation theory including both leading and next-to-leading order QCD corrections and leading order corrections in the QED coupling [formula]. As usual, μ denotes a renormalization scale O(mb). For details concerning phenomenological applications of the next-to-leading order Hamiltonian ([\ref=e8]) to nonleptonic B-decays, the reader is referred to refs. [\cite=rfewp1] [\cite=rfewp2] [\cite=rf] [\cite=kps] where also the exact definitions of the current-current operators Qu1 / 2, Qc1 / 2, the QCD penguin operators [formula] and the electroweak penguin operators [formula] can be found.

The aim of the following discussion is to derive a transparent expression that allows a quantitative test whether the electroweak penguin amplitude [formula] determined by following the approach [\cite=bfewp] is consistent with the description through the Standard Model of electroweak interactions [\cite=sm]. To this end let us neglect the QCD corrections to the electroweak penguin operators. In view of the approximations that will be made in a moment, this approximation seems to be reasonable. Moreover, these QCD corrections should be small if one defines the top-quark mass properly as [formula] [\cite=bb] (see also ref. [\cite=rfewp3]). Within this approximation, the Wilson coefficients of the electroweak penguin operators are given by the functions (0)k(μ) specified in refs. [\cite=rfewp1] [\cite=rfewp2]. Since (0)8(μ) and (0)10(μ) vanish, we have to consider only the hadronic matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operators Q7 and Q9. Note that the operator Q9 plays the most important role because of its large Wilson coefficient [\cite=rfewp1].

The modes that are used in [\cite=bfewp] to determine the   →  s̄ electroweak penguins are B+  →  π0K+ and B-  →  π0K-. The corresponding ΔB =  - 1 hadronic matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operators Q7 and Q9 are given by

[formula]

In the notation of Gronau et al. [\cite=ghlrewp], the matrix elements ([\ref=e10a]) and ([\ref=e10b]) are incorporated in the electroweak penguin amplitude [formula]. On the other hand, the colour-allowed amplitude ' is related to hadronic matrix elements of the current-current operators Qu1 and Qu2. In order to calculate this quantity, we consider the mode 0d  →  π+K- since - in contrast to B-  →  π0K- - no colour-suppressed amplitude ' is present in this case. The corresponding hadronic matrix elements of the current-current operators Qu1 and Qu2 are given by

[formula]

where α and β denote [formula] colour indices. Note that QCD penguin matrix elements of the current-current operators Qu2 and Qc2 [\cite=rf], where the up- and charm-quarks run as virtual particles in the loops, respectively, contribute by definition to the QCD penguin amplitude ' and not to '. A similar comment applies also to the effects of inelastic final state interactions [\cite=kam] that originate e.g. from the rescattering process 0d  →  {D-sD+}  →  π+K-. In our notation, these contributions are related to penguin-like matrix elements of the current-current operators and are also included in '.

If we introduce non-perturbative B-parameters and apply the SU(3) flavour symmetry of strong interactions, i.e. do not distinguish between u, d and s quark-flavours, we obtain

[formula]

In these equations, the quantity f corresponds to the "factorized" matrix element [formula]. It is quite natural to assume 2(μ)  ≈   - B2(μ), since the π0-meson is a pseudoscalar particle and therefore emerges from the axial-vector parts of the quark-currents

[formula]
