Introduction

The detailed study of K decays during the past fifty years has contributed decisively to our current understanding of the fundamental interactions. Already the concept of strangeness as a new quantum number associated with kaons turned out to be extremely fruitful. An essential element in establishing the quark picture, it was crucial both for flavour physics and for the later development of QCD. The θ-τ puzzle in kaon decays suggested the violation of parity, a property now reflected in the chiral nature of the weak gauge interactions. The strong suppression of flavour-changing neutral current processes, as KL  →  μ+μ- or K-q mixing, motivated the GIM mechanism and the introduction of charm. Finally, the 1964 discovery of CP violation in K  →  ππ decays may be seen as an early manifestation of a three-generation Standard Model, ten years before even the charm quark was found. These examples illustrate impressively how the careful study of low energy phenomena may be sensitive to physics at scales much larger than mK itself, and that profound insights can be obtained by such indirect probes.

The replication of fermion generations, quark mixing and CP violation are striking features of the theory of weak interactions. While the gauge sector of the theory is well understood and tested with high precision, the breaking of electroweak symmetry and its ramifications in flavour physics leave still many questions unanswered. This situation is expected to improve substantially in the near future, when the flavour sector will be investigated in unprecedented detail, for instance with the upcoming B physics experiments. In addition, and in a complementary way, rare kaon processes continue to represent a large variety of excellent opportunities. General reviews on the subject may be found in [\cite=LV] [\cite=WW] [\cite=RW] [\cite=BR] [\cite=DI]. Here we present an update on several topics of current interest.

The remainder of this talk is organized as follows. Section 2 contains an updated discussion of K+  →  π+ν and KL  →  π0ν. The theoretical status of KL  →  π0e+e- is briefly reviewed in section 3. We then discuss, in section 4, some recent approaches to address the longstanding theoretical problem of KL  →  μ+μ- decay. Section 5 is devoted to muon polarization observables in K decays. We summarize in section 6.

K  →  πν

In this section we focus on the rare decays K+  →  π+ν and KL  →  π0ν, which are particularly promising. In these modes the loop-induced FCNC transition s  →  d is probed by a neutrino current, which couples only to heavy gauge bosons (W, Z), as shown in fig. [\ref=fig:kpnn]. Correspondingly, the GIM pattern of the s̄  →  ν amplitude has, roughly speaking, the form

[formula]

summed over i = u, c, t (λi = V*isVid). The power-like mass dependence strongly enhances the short-distance contributions, coming from the heavy flavours c and t. (This is to be contrasted with the logarithmic mass dependence of the photonic penguin, important for s̄  →  e+e-.) The short-distance dominance has, then, two crucial consequences. First, the transition proceeds through an effectively local (s̄d)V - A(ν)V - A interaction. Second, because that local interaction is semileptonic, the only hadronic matrix element required, 〈π|(s̄d)V|K〉, can be obtained from K+  →  π0l+ν decay using isospin. As a result K  →  πν is calculable completely and with exceptional theoretical control. While K+  →  π+ν receives both top and charm contributions, KL  →  π0ν probes direct CP violation [\cite=LI] and is dominated entirely by the top sector.

The K  →  πν modes have been studied in great detail over the years to quantify the degree of theoretical precision. Important effects come from short-distance QCD corrections. These were computed at leading order in [\cite=DDG]. The complete next-to-leading order calculations [\cite=BB123] [\cite=MU] [\cite=BB99] reduce the theoretical uncertainty in these decays to ~  5% for K+  →  π+ν and ~  1% for KL  →  π0ν. This picture is essentially unchanged when further effects are considered, including isospin breaking in the relation of K  →  πν to K+  →  π0l+ν [\cite=MP], long-distance contributions [\cite=RS] [\cite=HLLW], the CP-conserving effect in KL  →  π0ν in the Standard Model [\cite=RS] [\cite=BI] and two-loop electroweak corrections for large mt [\cite=BB7]. The current Standard Model predictions for the branching ratios are [\cite=AJB99]

[formula]

The study of K  →  πν can give crucial information for testing the CKM picture of flavor mixing. This information is complementary to the results expected from B physics and is much needed to provide the overdetermination of the unitarity triangle necessary for a real test. Let us briefly illustrate some specific opportunities.

KL  →  π0ν is probably the best probe of the Jarlskog parameter JCP  ~  Imλt, the invariant measure of CP violation in the Standard Model [\cite=BB6]. For example a 10% measurement B(KL  →  π0ν) = (3.0  ±  0.3)  ·  10- 11 would directly give Imλt = (1.37  ±  0.07)  ·  10- 4, a remarkably precise result.

Combining 10% measurements of both KL  →  π0ν and K+  →  π+ν determines the unitarity triangle parameter sin 2β with an uncertainty of about ±  0.07, comparable to the precision obtainable for the same quantity from CP violation in B  →  J / ΨKS before the LHC era.

A measurement of B(K+  →  π+ν) to 10% accuracy can be expected to determine |Vtd| with similar precision.

As a final example, using only information from the ratio of Bd  -  d to Bs  -  s mixing, ΔMd  /  ΔMs, one can derive a stringent and clean upper bound [\cite=BB99]

[formula]

Note that the ε-constraint or Vub with their theoretical uncertainties (entering ([\ref=bkpnn])) are not needed here. Using [formula], rsd < 1.4 (describing SU(3) breaking in the ratio of Bd to Bs mixing matrix elements) and [formula], gives the bound B(K+  →  π+ν) < 1.67  ·  10- 10, which can be confronted with future measurements of K+  →  π+ν decay. Here we have assumed

[formula]

corresponding to the present world average [\cite=ART]. A future increase in this lower bound will strengthen the bound in ([\ref=kpnxs]) accordingly. Any violation of ([\ref=kpnxs]) will be a clear signal of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Indeed, the decays K  →  πν, being highly suppressed in the Standard Model, could potentially be very sensitive to New-Physics effects. This topic has been addressed repeatedly [\cite=GN] [\cite=NW] [\cite=HHW] [\cite=BRS] [\cite=CI] [\cite=BSIK] [\cite=BCIRS] in the recent literature. Most discussions have focussed in particular on general supersymmetric scenarios [\cite=NW] [\cite=BRS] [\cite=CI] [\cite=BSIK] [\cite=BCIRS]. Large effects are most likely to occur via enhanced Z-penguin contributions. This is expected because the s̄dZ vertex is a dimension-4 operator (allowed by the breaking of electroweak symmetry) in the low-energy effective theory, where the heavy degrees of freedom associated with the New Physics have been integrated out. The corresponding Z-penguin amplitude for s̄  →  ν will thus be ~  1 / M2Z, much larger than the New Physics contribution of dimension 6 scaling as ~  1 / M2S, if we assume that the scale of New Physics MS  ≫  MZ. It has been pointed out in [\cite=CI] that, in a generic supersymmetric model with minimal particle content and R-parity conservation, the necessary flavour violation in the induced s̄dZ coupling is potentially dominated by double LR mass insertions related to squark mixing. This mechanism could lead to sizable enhancements still allowed by known constraints. An updated discussion is given in [\cite=BCIRS]. Typically, enhancements over the Standard Model branching ratios could be up to a factor of 10 (3) for KL  →  π0ν (K+  →  π+ν) within this framework.

In the experimental quest for K  →  πν an important step has been accomplished by Brookhaven experiment E787, which observed a single, but very clean candidate event for K+  →  π+ν in 1997. This event is practically background free and corresponded to a branching fraction of B(K+  →  π+ν) = (4.2+ 9.7- 3.5)  ·  10- 10 [\cite=ADL]. E787 has very recently released an updated result, based on about 2.5 times the data underlying the previous measurement. In addition to the single, earlier event, no new signal candidates are observed, which translates into [\cite=SAT]

[formula]

The experiment is still ongoing and will be followed by a successor experiment, E949 [\cite=E949], at Brookhaven. Recently, a new experiment, CKM [\cite=CKM], has been proposed to measure K+  →  π+ν at the Fermilab Main Injector, studying K decays in flight. Plans to investigate this process also exist at KEK for the Japan Hadron Facility (JHF) [\cite=JHFS].

The neutral mode, KL  →  π0ν, is currently pursued by KTeV. The present upper limit reads [\cite=KLPNTEV]

[formula]

For KL  →  π0ν a model independent upper bound can be infered from the experimental result on K+  →  π+ν [\cite=GN]. It is given by B(KL  →  π0ν) < 4.4B(K+  →  π+ν)  <  2  ·  10- 9. At least this sensitivity will have to be achieved before New Physics is constrained with B(KL  →  π0ν). Concerning the future of KL  →  π0ν experiments, a proposal exists at Brookhaven (BNL E926) to measure this decay at the AGS with a sensitivity of O(10- 12) [\cite=E926]. There are furthermore plans to pursue this mode with comparable sensitivity at Fermilab [\cite=KAMI] and KEK [\cite=JHFI]. The prospects for KL  →  π0ν at a φ-factory are discussed in [\cite=BCI].

KL  →  π0e+e-

The decay mode KL  →  π0e+e- offers another well-known possibility to probe the FCNC transition s  →  d. In this case the presence of photon exchange interactions leads to an increased sensitivity to long-distance dynamics, in comparison with K  →  πν, and makes the theoretical situation more complicated. One may distinguish three different contributions to the KL  →  π0e+e- amplitude, which could all be of comparable size.

The first, and the one of greatest phenomenological interest, is from direct CP violation. This component is short-distance dominated, known at next-to-leading order in QCD [\cite=BLMM], and constitutes an interesting probe of Imλt in the Standard Model. It would likewise be sensitive to new sources of flavour violation, arising, for instance, in the context of supersymmetry [\cite=CI] [\cite=BSIK] [\cite=BCIRS]. By itself the mechanism of direct CP violation would correspond to a Standard Model branching ratio of [\cite=AJB99]

[formula]

The second contribution is from indirect CP violation and is generated by the admixture of the "wrong" CP component in the KL meson. This amplitude is approximately ε  ·  A(KS  →  π0e+e-), where the process KS  →  π0e+e- is entirely dominated by long-distance physics. In chiral perturbation theory the KS  →  π0e+e- amplitude is described by the diagrams shown in figure [\ref=fig:kspee]. There is a divergent loop integral, which is renormalized by a counterterm contribution. The counterterm, corresponding to a coupling in the chiral Lagrangian, is unknown at present and this translates into a very large uncertainty in estimating A(KS  →  π0e+e-) and the effect of indirect CP violation in KL  →  π0e+e-. Recently a detailed model independent analysis of KS  →  π0e+e- beyond the lowest order O(p4) in chiral perturbation theory has been performed in [\cite=DEIP]. This should provide a useful starting point for future analyses of K  →  πl+l- modes and, particularly, CP violation in KL  →  π0e+e-. In [\cite=DEIP] the following estimate has been given for the total CP violating branching ratio, which results from the interference of the direct and the indirect contribution:

[formula]

Here aS  =  O(1) is related to the unknown counterterm in A(KS  →  π0e+e-). Eq. ([\ref=kpecpv]) is valid for not too small [formula]. Taken by itself, indirect CP violation would give

[formula]

corresponding to the first term in ([\ref=kpecpv]). It is clear that, next to measuring B(KL  →  π0e+e-), an experimental determination of B(KS  →  π0e+e-) will be essential for extracting the contribution of direct CP violation. On the other hand, as emphasized in [\cite=DEIP], if |aS| is not too small, both a reliable measurement of this quantity from B(KS  →  π0e+e-) and a determination of Imλt via ([\ref=kpecpv]) may indeed become feasible. The decay KS  →  π0e+e- could be within reach of KLOE at Frascati and NA48 at CERN.

Finally, KL  →  π0e+e- receives a CP conserving contribution from the two-photon intermediate state, KL  →  π0γ*γ*  →  π0e+e-. Using experimental information on KL  →  π0γγ decay, it is expected that [\cite=EPRCDM] [\cite=DG]

[formula]

for the CP conserving branching fraction (there is no interference between the CP violating and the CP conserving amplitude in the total rate). In principle, it would even be possible to disentangle the CP conserving and the CP violating component by means of their characteristically different Dalitz plot distributions [\cite=DEIP] [\cite=GI99].

Additional handles for separating the various contributions in KL  →  π0e+e- may be provided by studying the time dependent interference between the decays of KL and KS into π0e+e-, or the electron energy asymmetry in KL  →  π0e+e- (see [\cite=DG] and references therein).

The current limit from KTeV reads [\cite=SEN]

[formula]

which is still about two orders of magnitude above the Standard Model expectation.

KL  →  μ+μ-

The decay mode KL  →  μ+μ- is a classic example of a rare kaon decay. Its strong suppression gave early clues on flavour physics, which proved seminal for understanding the basic structure of weak interactions. Today, KL  →  μ+μ- is measured with very good accuracy [\cite=PDG]

[formula]

This degree of precision is remarkable for a rare process with such a small branching fraction. A still more precise result, B(KL  →  μ+μ-) = (7.24  ±  0.17)  ·  10- 9, has recently been obtained [\cite=AMB]. Unfortunately KL  →  μ+μ- is largely dominated by long-distance dynamics and it has remained notoriously difficult to extract useful information on short-distance physics from ([\ref=klmex]). The long-distance amplitude originates in the two-photon intermediate state, KL  →  γ*γ*  →  μ+μ-, whereas Z-penguin and box graphs, analogous to those discussed in the context of K  →  πν, yield a contribution to the FCNC transition KL  →  μ+μ- arising directly at short distances. The branching fraction can be written as

[formula]

where the dispersive amplitude ReA = ASD + ALD consists of the dispersive part of the two-photon contribution, ALD, and the short-distance amplitude ASD. The absorptive part ImA comes from the process KL  →  γγ  →  μ+μ-, where the intermediate photons are on-shell. It is thus related to the decay KL  →  γγ, which implies

[formula]

Comparing this with ([\ref=klmex]), ([\ref=breim]), one observes that very little room is left for the dispersive contribution |ReA|. However, to convert this interesting result into a useful constraint on ASD a reliable estimate is needed for the long-distance dispersive amplitude ALD. This problem has remained a challenge for theorists over the years. In the following we will briefly describe some recent theoretical efforts.

In [\cite=GDP] it has been suggested to consider chiral perturbation theory with a meson nonet and [formula] symmetry (instead of the standard octet and [formula]). This is justified in the large-Nc limit of QCD where the η' becomes the ninth pseudo-goldstone boson. Within this framework the lowest order contribution (O(p4)) in the chiral expansion, KL  →  (π0,η,η')  →  γ*γ*  →  μ+μ-, gives a non-vanishing result, in contrast to standard chiral perturbation theory. The counterterm needed to renormalize the UV divergent two-photon loop diagram is fixed using η  →  μ+μ- decay. This yields an estimate of ALD. Together with the experimental constraints on |ReA|2 (from B(KL  →  μ+μ-) and B(KL  →  γγ)) [\cite=GDP] infer

[formula]

This is to be compared with the Standard Model expectation [\cite=AJB99]

[formula]

The bound in ([\ref=asdgdp]) is thus not yet sufficiently strong to probe Standard Model physics. Further improvements may be possible by measuring B(KL  →  μ+μ-) and B(η  →  μ+μ-) with higher accuracy. Most importantly, however, a more reliable assessment of the theoretical uncertainties inherent to the approach is still needed [\cite=GDP]. For a critical discussion of this issue see also [\cite=KPPR]. We finally mention that [\cite=GDP] obtained the prediction

[formula]

as a by-product of their analysis (see also [\cite=GV]). This result is quite stable because of the dominance of calculable large logarithms ln (mK / me) in the KL  →  e+e- amplitude. The prediction was subsequently confirmed by Brookhaven experiment E871, which finds [\cite=E871]

[formula]

Incidentally, this is the smallest branching ratio ever observed.

An alternative approach to describe KL  →  μ+μ- has been proposed in [\cite=DIP]. In this paper the following ansatz is suggested for the KL  →  γ*(q1)γ*(q2) form factor

[formula]

As discussed in [\cite=DIP], this low-energy parametrization exhibits the following particular features: It is consistent with chiral perturbation theory to O(p6) and it includes the poles of vector resonances with arbitrary residues. The parameters α and β are experimentally accessible in the decays KL  →  l+l-γ and KL  →  μ+μ-e+e-. Finally, certain constraints can be derived from QCD for f(q2,q2) in the limit q2  ≫  m2V. Using this framework, the authors of [\cite=DIP] derive

[formula]

which is very similar to ([\ref=asdgdp]). A recent discussion of KL  →  μ+μ- can also be found in [\cite=GV], where the difficulty of extracting short-distance information from this decay in a truly model-independent way is particularly emphasized.

μ-Polarization in K Decays

Measuring the polarization of muons from K decays allows one to study a number of interesting CP-odd or T-odd observables. In general such observables are very small in the Standard Model. However, the expected small effects are, in several cases, theoretically quite well under control. Muon polarization observables are then particularly suited as genuine probes of new interactions and thus provide us with additional and complementary tools to explore the physics of flavour.

A typical example is the transverse muon polarization

[formula]

in K+  →  π0μ+ν decay. A nonvanishing polarization could arise from the interference of the leading, standard W-exchange amplitude with a charged-higgs exchange contribution involving CP violating couplings. PμT is therefore an interesting probe of New Physics [\cite=GK] [\cite=FV] with conceivable effects of up to PμT  ~  10- 3. Planned experiments could reach a sensitivity of PμT  ~  10- 4 [\cite=ABE] [\cite=DIW]. Independently of CP or T violation a nonvanishing PμT can in principle be induced by final state interactions (FSI). Note that [formula] is not forbidden by CP or T symmetry, although it can be induced when these symmetries are violated. In the case of K+  →  π0μ+ν FSI phases arise only at two loops in QED (fig. [\ref=fig:kmup] (a)) and are very small (PμT(FSI)  ~  10- 6) [\cite=ZHI]. This peculiar feature of K+  →  π0μ+ν is to be contrasted with the case of K0  →  π-μ+ν, where the final state contains two charged particles. Correspondingly the FSI phase, now a one-loop effect, is then much larger.

Transverse muon polarization may also be studied using the radiative decay K+  →  μ+νγ. Also in this case the Standard Model effect from electromagnetic final state interactions is generated already at one loop (fig. [\ref=fig:kmup] (b)) and therefore more prominent than in K+  →  π0μ+ν. A recent detailed study of this mechanism has been performed in [\cite=HI]. It is found that transverse polarization can be computed quite reliably and occurs at the level of PμT(FSI)  ~  10- 4. Concerning potential signals of New Physics, [\cite=HI] estimate that [formula] in generic supersymmetric models with unbroken R-parity. Larger effects could arise if R-parity is broken [\cite=CGL] or with an extended Higgs sector [\cite=GLKLO]. In the absence of an enhancement by New Physics, transverse muon polarization in K+  →  μ+νγ, observed at the 10- 4 Standard Model level, could still be a valuable experimental cross-check on an eventual signal in K+  →  π0μ+ν, as both decays can be studied with the same apparatus [\cite=RA].

Another interesting effect is the CP violating longitudinal muon polarization asymmetry PμL in KL  →  μ+μ- decay [\cite=EP]. As discussed in the previous section, it is very difficult to compute theoretically the branching fraction for this mode. However, using the measured branching ratio as an input, PμL can be rather reliably calculated in the Standard Model using chiral perturbation theory. This is because the dominant effect, from indirect CP violation related to εK, proceeds through the KS  →  γ*γ*  →  μ+μ- amplitude, which is well under control in the chiral perturbation theory framework. The calculation gives PμL  ≈  2  ·  10- 3 [\cite=EP]. An effect significantly above this level would be a clear signal of New Physics. Unfortunately, the KL  →  μ+μ- branching ratio is very small and an experiment to measure PμL appears challenging.

Summary

In this talk we have reviewed a selection of important topics in the field of rare kaon decays, highlighting in particular some recent developments.

The rare decay modes K+  →  π+ν and, even more so, KL  →  π0ν clearly stand out as excellent, theoretically clean probes of both the standard theory of flavour and the physics beyond it. Similar physics can be addressed by studying KL  →  π0e+e-, although the theoretical situation is considerably more complex in this case. An experimental study of the related decay KS  →  π0e+e- will be needed as crucial input for a better understanding of CP violation in KL  →  π0e+e-. The required measurements could possibly be performed at KLOE (Frascati) and NA48 (CERN).

The process KL  →  μ+μ- is already accurately measured today. On the other hand it continues to present a big challenge for theory. Recent theoretical efforts may lead to an improved understanding of the long-distance dynamics that determines this mode.

Muon polarization observables in K+  →  π0μ+ν, K+  →  μ+νγ or KL  →  μ+μ- provide interesting tests of the flavour sector, complementary to measurements of rare decay branching fractions. In the Standard Model these muon polarization effects are very small, which is assured in general with good theoretical reliability. They qualify therefore as genuine probes of New Physics.

There are many further possibilities, e.g. lepton flavour violating modes (KL  →  μe, K  →  πμe) probing short-distance physics, or, on the other hand, studies of chiral perturbation theory to describe long-distance dominated kaon modes. The latter are of great interest not only as tests of strong interaction physics in low-energy weak processes from first principles, but also as a framework for assessing the effects of long-distance dynamics on the extraction of short-distance flavour physics.

The broad variety of possibilities and the compelling physics motivation promise an exciting long term future for studies of rare K decays.
