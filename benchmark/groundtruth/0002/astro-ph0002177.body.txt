In many gravitational interactions between galaxies, gas and stars that have been torn from either or both of the precursor galaxies can collect in 'tidal tails'. Star formation begins anew in these regions to produce 'tidal dwarf galaxies' [\cite=Mirabel92] [\cite=Duc94a] [\cite=Duc97b] [\cite=Duc98b], giving insight into the process of galaxy formation through the well-defined timescale of the interaction. But tracking the star formation process has proved to be difficult: the tidal dwarf galaxies with young stars showed no evidence of the molecular gas out of which new stars form [\cite=Brouillet92] [\cite=Walter99] [\cite=Smith94] [\cite=Smith99]. Here we report the discovery of molecular gas (carbon monoxide emission) in two tidal dwarf galaxies. In both cases, the molecular gas peaks at the same location as the maximum in atomic-hydrogen density, unlike most gas-rich galaxies. We infer from this that the molecular gas formed from the HI, rather than being torn in molecular form from the interacting galaxies. Star formation in the tidal dwarfs appears to mimic that process in normal spiral galaxies like our own.

Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) are gas-rich irregular galaxies made out of stellar and gaseous material pulled out by tidal forces from the disks of the colliding parent galaxies into the intergalactic medium [\cite=Zwicky56] [\cite=Schweizer78] [\cite=Hibbard96] [\cite=Ducrev]. They are found at the ends of long tidal tails, sometimes 100 kpc from the nuclei of their progenitors, and host active star-forming regions. TDGs contain two main stellar components: young stars recently formed by collapse of expelled atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds, and an older stellar population, at least 1 Gyr old, originally part of the disk of the parent galaxies. Their overall gaseous and stellar properties range between those of classical dwarf irregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies, with the exception of their metallicity which is higher - typical of the outer disk of a spiral [\cite=Ducrev]. Whether a large fraction of dwarf galaxies were formed through tidal encounters in the early universe when spiral galaxies were more gaseous and less metal rich and collisions more frequent is an open question and one of the drivers to study TDGs. One way to answer this question is the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies. Observations of ordinary dwarf galaxies show that a lot of dark matter, or mass that is in some sotofar invisible form, is necessary to account for their rotation velocities. Numerical simulations of gravitational interactions indicate that TDGs should have very little dark matter [\cite=Barnes92] if the dark matter is, as currently believed, in form of a large halo and not in, say, a rotating disk. Thus, if TDGs are found to possess the same dark matter properties as other dwarf galaxies then powerful constraints are placed on the form of dark matter. If TDGs do not contain dark matter as ordinary dwarf galaxies, then tidal interactions cannot be the principal formation mechanism for these small galaxies nor can dark matter be part of galactic disks.

The observations were carried out with the 30meter telescope operated by the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) on Pico Veleta, Spain in June of 1999. Carbon Monoxide (CO) emission is detected in the Southern TDG in Arp 105 (Figure 1 ; hereafter A105S) and main TDG in Arp 245 (Figure 2; hereafter A245N) in both the ground state CO(J = 1 - 0) and the CO(J = 2 - 1) transitions. Small maps were made of both sources to localise the CO emission with respect to the atomic hydrogen (HI), ionized gas (Hα), and optical continuum [\cite=Duc97b] [\cite=Duc99b]. The central (0,0) CO(1-0) spectra are shown in Fig. 3 along with the HI spectra at the same positions with a similar beamsize. The CO(1-0) luminosities and derived H2 mass estimates (see Table 1) of A105S and A245N are far above those of other dwarf galaxies [\cite=Taylor98]. Despite the different environments, the star formation efficiency, defined as the rate of star formation per mass of molecular gas, is quite close to that observed in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies [\cite=Kennicutt98].

Small CO maps have been made consisting of six positions towards A105S and four positions towards A245N. In both cases, the CO peaks at the HI column density maximum and the dynamics of the atomic and molecular components are virtually identical (Figure 3). In spiral galaxies, on the other hand, HI and CO have very different distributions (see e.g. [\cite=Guelin93] [\cite=Braine4414a]), showing that the molecular gas that we have found in the TDGs has not simply been torn off the parent galaxies together with the HI but has formed in situ. Although the calculations were performed for post-shock gas, an estimate of the molecule formation time is t  ~  n- 1Gyr [\cite=Hollenbach89] where n is the density of the atomic medium in particles cm- 3. Numerical simulations of Arp 245 [\cite=Duc99b] yield an age of about 100 Myr for A245N and a rough age estimate for A105S can be obtained by dividing the projected distance to the spiral by the relative radial velocity, yielding about 200 Myr [\cite=Duc97b], sufficient for H2 formation in standard atomic hydrogen clouds ([formula]cm- 3). The dust on which the H2 forms is captured from the parent galaxies and present in the atomic gas [\cite=Neininger96] [\cite=Dumke97] [\cite=Braine3079]. The molecular gas has formed inside the HI clouds and star formation is proceeding in a standard way from the molecular gas.

Our observations show that the molecular gas is an important component in the visible mass budget of TDGs, between ~  20% and [formula]% of the atomic hydrogen mass (see Table 1). The fact that we detect large quantities of molecular gas and that we have every reason to believe that this gas is the result of conversion from HI into H2 indicates that the central regions of these objects should be gravitationally bound. If the HI were dense enough pre-encounter then CO would form and be routinely detected beyond R25 (the optical radius) in galactic disks, like HI - it is not [\cite=Guelin93] [\cite=Neininger96] [\cite=Dumke97] [\cite=sage]. While it was clear that TDGs are kinematically decoupled from their parent galaxies, prior to these data, the evidence that TDGs were bound was morphological - the accumulation of matter at the tips of the tidal tails and the presence of star forming regions. Although higher angular resolution is necessary, this conclusion provides firmer ground for the calculation of the dynamical mass, which relies on the assumption that the object is gravitationally bound and in equilibrium, and thus for the determination of dark matter which by definition is detected as discrepancy between the velocities expected based on the mass of what we see directly and those observed.
