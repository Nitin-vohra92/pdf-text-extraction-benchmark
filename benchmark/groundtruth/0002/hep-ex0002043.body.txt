Search for Charginos with a Small Mass Difference to the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle at = 189

Introduction

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most appealing extensions of the Standard Model. In SUSY theories with minimal particle content (MSSM) [\cite=mssm], in addition to the ordinary particles, there is a supersymmetric spectrum of particles with spins which differ by one half with respect to their Standard Model partners.

Charginos (), which are a mixture of the supersymmetric partners of   (gaugino state) and H± (higgsino state), are pair produced via s-channel [formula] exchange. The production cross section can be reduced by an order of magnitude when the t-channel scalar neutrino () exchange is important.

In this paper the hypothesis of R-parity conservation is made. The R-parity is a quantum number which distinguishes ordinary particles from supersymmetric particles. If R-parity is conserved supersymmetric particles are pair-produced and their decay chain always contains, besides standard particles, two Lightest Supersymmetric Particles (LSP). The LSP, which is stable and weakly-interacting, escapes detection. The LSP can be the lightest neutralino (), a mixture of the supersymmetric partners of Z, , and neutral Higgs bosons, or the scalar neutrino.

As long as charginos are sufficiently heavier than the LSP, their decay products can be detected with high trigger and selection efficiencies. When the mass difference ([formula]) is smaller than 4 , the search described in Ref. [\cite=stsearch] (hereafter referred as standard) becomes very inefficient, because in that range the signal and the photon-photon interaction background are indistinguishable.

For [formula] between a few hundred and a few , charginos decay near the interaction vertex and the energy carried by the visible decay products is so small that trigger inefficiencies become substantial. In addition, such a signal is overwhelmed by the photon-photon interaction background, which is rapidly increasing for decreasing masses of the photon-photon system. The trigger efficiency and the signal to background ratio can be improved by requiring in the event an Initial State Radiation (ISR) photon with high transverse momentum. Therefore, in this paper we report a search for the process

[formula]

where X stands for low energy standard charged particles.

This method was previously used in the Mark II experiment [\cite=mark2] in the search for a fourth lepton doublet, whose members are close in mass. It was then suggested [\cite=gsearch] for the search at LEP for charginos nearly mass-degenerate with the LSP. The DELPHI collaboration recently published such a search in a data sample collected at [formula] [\cite=DELPHI183].

Data Sample and Monte Carlo Simulations

This search uses the data collected at 189 with the L3 detector[\cite=L3-DETECTOR] for an integrated luminosity of 176 pb- 1 . The following background processes are simulated: [formula], [formula] and [formula] with KORALZ[\cite=KORALZ], [formula] with KORALW[\cite=KORALW] and radiative Bhabha scattering with TEEGG[\cite=TEEGG]. The statistics of the Monte Carlo is equivalent to more than 60 times the integrated luminosity except for radiative Bhabha events where it is more than 16 times.

Photon-photon interactions with hadronic final state ([formula]) can not be reliably simulated in the range of interest of this analysis, because of the large theoretical uncertainties on the differential cross section in the non-perturbative regime. For photon-photon interactions with leptonic final states ([formula]) there is no complete Monte Carlo including the simulation of initial state radiation. For this reason, no photon-photon background is used.

Signal events are simulated with SUSYGEN [\cite=susygen2.2] for chargino masses between 45 and 88 and from 30 to 4 . Only events with a photon more than 10 away from the beam pipe and with an energy greater than 4 are considered. These requirements will be referred as fiducial cuts. The chargino decay branching ratios as in Ref. [\cite=gsearch] are used. For smaller than 200 , decay lengths of a few centimetres may occur. In this case, decays are treated by the GEANT [\cite=geant] package.

The detector response is simulated using the GEANT package. It takes into account effects of energy loss, multiple scattering and showering in the detector materials and in the beam pipe. Hadronic interactions are simulated with the GHEISHA program [\cite=gheisha]. Time dependent inefficiencies of the different subdetectors and of the trigger are also taken into account in the simulation procedure.

Low phenomenology

The search for low charginos accompanied by ISR photons does not suffer from the large photon-photon interaction background if the transverse momentum of the photon is large enough. While in signal events the missing momentum is due to weakly interacting particles, in photon-photon interactions it is due to the electrons escaping in the beam pipe. In the latter case, if a high transverse momentum photon is present the two final state electrons must be deflected into the detector. To suppress the photon-photon interactions, the following requirement on the photon transverse momentum is applied:

[formula]

where θd is the minimum detection angle for the deflected electron and Ebeam is the beam energy. For the L3 detector, [formula] resulting in [formula]. With this requirement the photon energy is large enough to trigger the detector.

The ISR energy spectrum in signal events, as shown in Figure [\ref=ecuteff], depends on the relative contribution of the s-channel Z exchange, which in turn depends on the [formula] coupling. A softer photon spectrum is expected in the case of higgsino-like charginos than in the case of gaugino-like charginos. In addition, when scalar neutrinos are as light as charginos the t-channel diagram becomes important and modifies the shape of the ISR energy spectrum as shown in Figure [\ref=ecuteff].

Chargino decay branching ratios in the low region change according to the opening of the various decay channels. For [formula], the hadronic decay channel in one or two pions is enhanced and the decay spectrum is more similar to τ± decays than to W± decays.

The decay length increases with decreasing . For [formula], the decays near the interaction vertex within 1 cm. For [formula], the decays often inside the detector but a few centimetres away from the interaction vertex. For less than the π± mass, the decays outside the detector and appears as a heavy stable charged particle.

Chargino decays via virtual scalar lepton exchange occur if scalar leptons are as light as charginos, but only for gaugino-like charginos whose coupling to scalar leptons is strong enough. In general, the chargino width is not affected by supersymmetric scalar particles as long as they are more than 15 heavier than the . The same is true for chargino branching ratios if supersymmetric scalar particles are at least 30 heavier than the .

As an example, chargino decays are purely leptonic and the chargino decay length is extremely short when the is mass degenerate with or lighter than the chargino. In the latter case, where the two-body decay channel [formula] is open, chargino decay lengths are smaller than 1 cm as long as is more than the electron mass.

Analysis

Preselection

This preselection, as well as the following selections, are tailored only on the expected signal distributions, because, as mentioned in Section [\ref=simu], the simulation of Standard Model background processes is incomplete.

The aim of the preselection is to keep events with at least two charged particles not necessarily coming from the interaction vertex and an energetic photon. The analysis relies mainly on the photon identification in the electromagnetic calorimeter (BGO). In addition, we use the tracking chamber to detect charged particles and to measure their momentum and eventually decay length. Additional energy deposits due to the soft chargino decay products are allowed, but no strict requirement is applied on them.

The BGO must contain an electromagnetic energy deposit more than 20 away from the beam pipe and with a transverse momentum compatible with equation ([\ref=etcut]). There must be no track in a 1 sector in the r  -  φ plane around the photon with a number of hits higher than 10 out of a maximum of 62. This photon has also to be isolated in space: neither a track with more than 10 hits nor a significant energy deposit in the BGO should be in a 15 cone around the photon. We also require that the event contains at least 2 tracks: one with at least 10 hits and a distance to the interaction vertex in the r  -  φ plane (DCA) smaller than 1 cm; and a second track satisfying either these criteria or having at least 20 hits. For signal events satisfying these requirements, the trigger efficiency is nearly 100%.

Since chargino decay products carry a small amount of energy, the following selection criteria are applied: no significant energy deposit in the low angle calorimeters covering [formula]; less than 16 in the hadronic calorimeter; less than 3 in the electromagnetic calorimeter between BGO barrel and endcaps; no muon track with a momentum greater than 10 . Excluding the photon, the remaining energy in the BGO must be less than 16 , and the total calorimetric energy must be less than 18 . High multiplicity events are rejected by requiring less than 10 tracks and less than 15 BGO energy clusters.

After these cuts, 43 data events are selected for 10.8 expected from Standard Model processes which have been simulated. Some of the remaining data events are not compatible with any signals and they are probably due to photon-photon interactions. This is illustrated in Figure [\ref=etimb], which shows the transverse energy imbalance (ETvis / Evis) distribution for the data, the simulated Standard Model background and the signal (all masses and folded in the same distribution). It is clear from this distribution that data events with small transverse energy imbalance are not consistent with any signal. Hence, we add the requirement that the transverse energy imbalance must be greater than 0.1.

The photon-photon interaction background should be completely eliminated by the requirement of equation ([\ref=etcut]). In fact, this is true only for an absolutely hermetic detector, such that deflected electrons are not missed. To investigate this problem a sample of simulated [formula] events, generated with PHOJET[\cite=PHOJET] for a mass of the γγ system greater than 3 , is used. The expected background from this source, concentrated at low values of transverse energy imbalance, is 0.8 events. This result is not conclusive because masses of the γγ system below 3 can not be simulated due to the aforementioned uncertainties on the photon-photon interaction cross section. Nevertheless, it shows that a non-zero background from photon-photon interaction is expected, due to small residual inefficiencies to tag electrons at low angles ([formula]), which might explain the excess of data.

Finally, 29 data events are selected and 10.7 are expected from the simulated Standard Model background (4.2 from [formula], 5.5 from [formula], < 0.06 from [formula], 0.8 from , 0.2 from W+W[formula]).

Selections

Three different selections are devised according to the range explored: low , very low and ultra low selections.

The low selection is optimized for around 3 . At such , charginos decay promptly and their decay products carry enough energy to reach the BGO. This selection requires that the event contains at least 2 tracks with a DCA smaller than 1 cm and a second energy deposit in the BGO.

The very low selection is optimized for around 1 whereas the ultra low selection is optimized for around 300 and less. At such small , no muons are able to reach the muon chamber. Therefore, events must not contain muon tracks. The other requirements on the calorimetric energy are modified according to the smaller energy deposited by the chargino decay products. No requirements on the track momentum are applied in the ultra low selection to take into account the possible high momentum tracks produced by long lived charginos. Table [\ref=cuts] lists all selection cuts for all regions.

The number of selected data events and expected backgrounds are shown in Table [\ref=nev]. This table displays also the number of events selected by the three selections combined. Finally, for a given mass, events are considered as candidates only if the effective centre-of-mass energy is high enough, i.e. the photon recoil mass is greater than twice the mass.

Results

The selection efficiency for short-lived charginos with a photon within fiducial cuts is about 35% for [formula]. In Figure [\ref=brdm]a the selection efficiency is shown as a function of the chargino decay length. For decay lengths of tens of centimetres the efficiency decreases to approximately 20%, because in that range highly ionising chargino tracks reach the tracking chamber and the BGO calorimeter. The efficiency drops for decay lengths of a few metres. This drop is due to long-lived charginos which produce high momentum tracks in the muon chambers and events without missing energy. This kind of signal, which suffers from the μ+μ-γ(γ) background, is taken into account by the search for stable heavy charged particles [\cite=heavystab].

In Figure [\ref=brdm]b is shown the selection efficiency as a function of for several values of the chargino decay length. The drop for [formula] is due to the magnetic field which bends low momentum tracks, such that they do not reach the tracking chamber. This is a major experimental limitation in the search of short-lived charginos for [formula]. In particular, for [formula] or [formula] mass degenerate with charginos the decay length is extremely short as long as is above the electron mass.

In Figure [\ref=effic]a is shown the acceptance for events with an ISR photon within fiducial cuts as a function of the chargino mass. This acceptance also depends on the chargino mixture and on the mass. The total efficiency, product of the efficiency in Figure [\ref=brdm] and the acceptance in Figure [\ref=effic]a, is derived as shown in Figure [\ref=effic]b for a gaugino-like . In the same way, efficiencies are also estimated for a higgsino-like , and for a gaugino-like in the light case. The evolution of the efficiency with [formula] is essentially governed by the ISR spectrum.

A Standard Model process with a similar signature to the one we search in this analysis is . The analysis of events has already been performed on 189 data [\cite=papnng], resulting in a good agreement between observation and Standard Model expectation. Systematic uncertainties affecting the photon identification, which are smaller than 1%, are relevant for the systematics on the efficiency shown in Figure [\ref=effic]b. The loose requirements on the soft charged tracks induce negligible systematics. Larger uncertainties are due to Monte Carlo statistical errors. They range between 6% and 7% according to the chargino mixture and decay length. These systematics are neglected hereafter since the derived limits are already conservative due to the omission of the photon-photon interaction processes, resulting in an underestimation of the background.

Overall we select 8 data events for 3.1 expected from the simulated Standard Model processes. We use the signal efficiency, the background prediction and the number of selected events, to derive a 95% confidence level upper limit on the chargino pair-production cross section as a function of and [formula] as shown in Figure [\ref=siglim]. Those limits are obtained by combining the three selections, according to the method in Ref. [\cite=stat] modified to include the background subtraction.

Interpretations in the MSSM

In the MSSM, chargino and neutralino masses depend on 4 parameters: M1 the U(1) gaugino mass, M2 the SU(2) gaugino mass, μ the Higgs mixing parameter and [formula] the ratio of the two Higgs vacuum expectation values.

Generally, equal gaugino masses at the GUT scale are assumed, such that M1 and M2 are not independent parameters. In this case, low values are possible only if [formula] and for M2 values larger than a few . However, models with gaugino mass non-universality can be considered [\cite=snow] and as mentioned in Ref. [\cite=gsearch] low regions become more natural in these models [\cite=gstring].

Once the unification relation is relaxed, three main regions can lead to low : |μ|  ≫  M2; in this region the mass is almost equal to M2, and are both gaugino-like and can be small if [formula]. [formula]; in this region and are both higgsino-like and nearly mass degenerate, independently of the values of M1 and M2. Their masses are almost equal to |μ|. [formula]; in this region of the parameter space and mass degeneracy can be obtained for pure or mixed states.

We derive chargino mass limits as a function of for all these scenarios. The limits are shown in Figures [\ref=exclmix] and [\ref=exclmix2]. For between 300 and 1 , gaugino-like are excluded up to 83.5 if the is heavy (Figure [\ref=exclmix]a) and up to 58.8 for any mass (Figure [\ref=exclmix2]a), where cross sections smaller by an order of magnitude are predicted. In Figure [\ref=exclmix2]a the limit is shown as a function of [formula], where the invisible particle can be either the lightest neutralino or the scalar neutrino. For the same range, higgsino-like are excluded up to 80.0 (Figure [\ref=exclmix]b).

The results of this search are combined with the results of the standard search[\cite=stsearch] and of the stable heavy charged particles search[\cite=heavystab] as shown in Figures [\ref=exclmix] and [\ref=exclmix2]. The search with an ISR photon fills the gap between the two previous analyses and allows to derive direct search mass limits independent of .

The intersection between the ISR search and the stable heavy charged particles search occurs for decay lengths of order 10 cm. However, the relation between the chargino decay length and the is dependent on the supersymmetric parameters. Due to the mild dependence of the efficiency on , a scan on the MSSM parameters is done to check the size of the overlap between these two searches. The relation between the decay length and used to derive the limits shown in Figures [\ref=exclmix]a, [\ref=exclmix]b and [\ref=exclmix2]a, is always the most conservative independently of the choice for the chargino mixture used for the cross section calculation. On the contrary, in Figure [\ref=exclmix2]b, where the Constrained MSSM [\cite=MSSM_GUT] is used, chargino and neutralino mixtures are uniquely defined and used both for the decay length and cross section calculations.

Assuming that scalar particles are sufficiently heavy to be able to neglect their contributions in chargino production and decay, the following chargino mass limits are derived at 95% C.L.:

As mentioned in Section [\ref=pheno], the chargino decay length also depends on the masses of the scalar particles. For light scalar quarks, hadronic decays are enhanced and a sharp change from short to long-lived charginos is expected for around the pion mass. In this case, the chargino mass limit is 0.5 lower for gaugino-like , while it is unchanged for higgsino-like . In the case of light scalar taus or [formula], the chargino mass limit is unchanged for gaugino-like and lowered by 0.8 for higgsino-like . For light scalar muons or [formula] the chargino mass limit is lowered by 1.3 for gaugino-like , while it is unchanged for higgsino-like .

No direct search mass limits are derived for light [formula] or [formula] masses, because there is still an uncovered region between the stable heavy charged particles search and the search with an ISR photon. This gap is due to the shorter decay length when these scalar particles are mass degenerate with or lighter than the chargino. In such a case, charginos are stable only for below the electron mass.

Figure [\ref=exclmix2]b shows the exclusion in the Constrained MSSM [\cite=MSSM_GUT] in the higgsino region (very large M2 values). The exclusion from the standard search is obtained by combining the contribution of the [formula] process[\cite=stsearch] with the chargino pair production:

In the Constrained MSSM, by using the scalar lepton search [\cite=slepton], a limit on the mass of 67.7 is also derived in the light case, assuming no mixing in the scalar tau sector. This limit of 67.7 is an absolute lower limit for the chargino in the Constrained MSSM parameter space, since the very large M2 domain is now excluded by this search.
