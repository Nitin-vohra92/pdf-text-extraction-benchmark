Introduction

There are many results concerning the optimal value of combinatorial optimization problems with random costs. Sometimes the costs are associated with n points generated uniformly at random in the unit square 2. In which case the most celebrated result is due to Beardwood, Halton and Hammersley [\cite=BHH] who showed that the minimum length of a tour through the points a.s. grew as βn1 / 2 for some still unknown β. For more on this and related topics see Steele [\cite=S1].

The optimisation problem in [\cite=BHH] is defined by the distances between the points. So, it is defined by a random matrix where the entries are highly correlated. There have been many examples considered where the matrix of costs contains independent entries. Aside from the Travelling Salesperson Problem, the most studied problems in combinatorial optimization are perhaps, the shortest path problem; the minimum spanning tree problem and the matching problem. As a first example, consider the shortest path problem in the complete graph Kn where the edge lengths are independent exponential random variables with rate 1. We denote the exponential random variable with rate λ by E(λ). Thus [formula] for x∈. Janson [\cite=J99] proved (among other things) that if Xi,j denotes the shortest distance between vertices i,j in this model then [formula] where [formula].

As far as the spanning tree problem is concerned, the first relevant result is due to Frieze [\cite=F85]. He showed that if the edges of the complete graph are given independent uniform

E =(1+o(1)) .

Pr( |C(G)-|≥ )≤ n,  ( |C(G)-|≥ )≤ n

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th1]

We find that the proofs in [\cite=W1], [\cite=W2] can be adapted to our current situation. Suppose that the vertices of G = Gn,n,p are denoted [formula] and [formula]. Let C(n,r) denote the cost of the minimum cost matching

[formula]

We will prove that w.h.p.

[formula]

for [formula] where

[formula]

Using this we argue that w.h.p.

[formula]

We will then show that

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=th1] follows from these two statements.

Outline of the proof

We first argue (Lemma [\ref=lem1]) that Br  =  φ(Ar) is a uniformly random set. This enables us to show (Lemma [\ref=lem2]) that w.h.p. vertices v∈Ar have aproximately (n - r)p neighbors in [formula]. Then comes the beautiful idea of adding a vertex bn + 1 and joining it to every vertex in A by an edge of cost E(λ). The heart of the proof is in Lemma [\ref=lem10a] that relates [formula] in a precise way to the probability that bn + 1 is covered by M*r, the minimum cost matching of Ar into [formula]. The proof now focuses on estimating this probability P(n,r). If r is not too close to n then this probability can be estimated (see [\eqref=innot]) by careful conditioning and the use of properties of the exponential distribution. From thereon, it is a matter of analysing the consequences of the estimate for [formula] in [\eqref=13]. The final part of the proof involves showing that [formula] is insignificant. This essentially boils down to showing that w.h.p. no edge in the minimum cost matching has cost more than O( log n / (np)).

Proof details

Let [formula].

Br is a random r-subset of B.

Let L denote the n  ×  n matrix of edge costs, where L(i,j) = W(ai,bj) and L(i,j) =   ∞   if edge (ai,bj) does not exist in G. For a permutation π of B let [formula] be defined by [formula]. Let X,Y be two distinct r-subsets of B and let π be any permutation of B that takes X into Y. Then we have

[formula]

where the last equality follows from the fact that L and [formula] have the same distribution.

We use the above lemma and the Chernoff bounds to bound degrees. For reference we use the following: Let B(n,p) denote the binomial random variable with parameters n,p. Then for 0  ≤  ε  ≤  1 and α > 0,

[formula]

For v∈A let [formula]. Then we have the following lemma:

[formula]

This follows from Lemma [\ref=lem1] i.e. [formula] is a random set and the Chernoff bounds [\eqref=chern1], [\eqref=chern2] with ε  =  ω- 1 / 5 viz.

[formula]

We can now use the ideas of [\cite=W1], [\cite=W2]. We add a special vertex bn + 1 to B, with edges to all n vertices of A. Each edge adjacent to bn + 1 is assigned an E(λ) cost independently, λ > 0. We now consider Mr to be a minimum cost matching of Ar into [formula]. We denote this matching by M*r and we let B*r denote the corresponding set of vertices of B* that are covered by M*r.

Define P(n,r) as the normalized probability that vn + 1 participates in M*r, i.e.

[formula]

Its importance lies in the following lemma:

[formula]

Let X = C(n,r) and let Y = C(n,r - 1). Fix i∈[r] and let w be the cost of the edge (ai,bn + 1), and let I denote the indicator variable for the event that the cost of the cheapest Ar-assignment that contains this edge is smaller than the cost of the cheapest Ar-assignment that does not use bn + 1. In other words, I is the indicator variable for the event {Y  +  w  <  X}.

If (ai,bn + 1)∈M*r then w  <  X  -  Y. Conversely, if w  <  X  -  Y and no other edge from bn + 1 has cost smaller than X  -  Y, then (ai,bn + 1)∈M*r, and when λ  →  0, the probability that there are two distinct edges from bn + 1 of cost smaller than X  -  Y is of order O(λ2).

Since w is E(λ) distributed, as λ  →  0 we have,

[formula]

The factor 1 / r comes from each i∈[r] being equally likely to be incident to the matching edge containing bn + 1, if it exists.

We now proceed to estimate P(n,r).

Suppose r  <  n - m. Then

[formula]

where |εr|  ≤  ω- 1 / 5.

Assume that bn + 1∉B*r - 1. M*r is obtained from M*r - 1 by finding an augmenting path [formula] from ar to [formula] of minimum additional cost. Let α = W(σ,τ). We condition on (i) σ, (ii) the lengths of all edges other than [formula] and (iii) [formula]. With this conditioning Mr - 1 = M*r - 1 will be fixed and so will [formula]. We can now use the following fact: Let [formula] be independent exponential random variables of rates [formula]. Then the probability that Xi is the smallest of them is [formula]. Furthermore, the probability stays the same if we condition on the value of [formula]. Thus

[formula]

[formula]

where |εr|  ≤  ω- 1 / 5.

Let ν(j)  =  p(n - j)(1  +  εj), |εj|  ≤  ω- 1 / 5. Then

[formula]

and each error factor satisfies |1  -  1  /  (1  +  εj)|  ≤  ω- 1 / 5. Letting λ  →  0 gives the lemma.

If r  ≤  n - m then

[formula]

where |εk|  ≤  ω- 1 / 5.

This follows from Lemma [\ref=lem10a] and Corollary [\ref=corollary1].

This confirms [\eqref=eq2] and we turn to [\eqref=sum=]. We use the following expression from Young [\cite=Y91].

[formula]

Let m1  =  ω1 / 4m. Observe first that

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

We can replace the sum in [\eqref=int1] by an integral because the sequence of summands is unimodal and the terms are all o(1).

Continuing, we have

[formula]

Observe next that

[formula]

So,

[formula]

If 1  ≤  k  ≤   log n then we write

[formula]

Now

[formula]

If k = 1 then

[formula]

And if 2  ≤  k  ≤   log n then

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Equation [\eqref=sum=] now follows from [\eqref=I0], [\eqref=I1], [\eqref=I2] and [\eqref=I3].

Turning to [\eqref=Cnm=] we prove the following lemma:

If r  ≥  n - m then [formula].

This will prove that

[formula]

and complete the proof of [\eqref=Cnm=] and hence Theorem [\ref=th1].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem3]

Let w(e) denote the weight of edge e in G. Let [formula] and let Gr be the subgraph of G induced by Vr. For a vertex v∈Vr order the neighbors [formula] of v in Gr so that w(v,ui)  ≤  w(v,ui + 1). Define the k-neighborhood [formula].

Let the k-neighborhood of a set be the union of the k-neighborhoods of its vertices. In particular, for S  ⊆  Ar + 1, T  ⊆  B,

[formula]

Given a function φ defining a matching M of Ar into B, we define the following digraph: let [formula] where [formula] is an orientation of

[formula]

An edge e∈M is oriented from B to A and has weight wr(e) =  - w(e). The remaining edges are oriented from A to B and have weight equal to their weight in G.

The arcs of directed paths in [formula] are alternately forwards A  →  B and backwards B  →  A and so they correspond to alternating paths with respect to the matching M. It helps to know (Lemma [\ref=cl1], next) that given a∈Ar + 1,b∈B we can find an alternating path from a to b with O( log n) edges. The ab-diameter will be the maximum over a∈Ar + 1,b∈B of the length of a shortest path from a to b.

W.h.p., for every φ, the (unweighted) ab-diameter of [formula] is at most k0  =  ⌈3 log 4n⌉.

For S  ⊆  Ar + 1, T  ⊆  B, let

[formula]

We first prove an expansion property: that whp, for all S  ⊆  Ar + 1 with |S|  ≤  ⌈n / 5⌉, |N(S)|  ≥  4|S|. (Note that N(S),N(T) involve edges oriented from A to B and so do not depend on φ.)

[formula]

Explanation: The o(1) term accounts for the probability that each vertex has at least 40 neighbors in [formula]. Condition on this. Over all possible ways of choosing s vertices and 4s "targets", we take the probability that for each of the s vertices, all 40 out-edges fall among the 4s out of the n possibilities.

Similarly, w.h.p., for all T  ⊆  B with |T|  ≤  ⌈n / 5⌉, |N(T)|  ≥  4|T|. Thus by the union bound, w.h.p. both these events hold. In the remainder of this proof we assume that we are in this "good" case, in which all small sets S and T have large vertex expansion.

Now, choose an arbitrary a∈Ar + 1, and define [formula] as the endpoints of all alternating paths starting from a and of lengths [formula]. That is,

[formula]

Since we are in the good case, |Si|  ≥  4|Si - 1| provided |Si - 1|  ≤  n / 5, and so there exists a smallest index iS such that |SiS - 1|  >  n / 5, and iS - 1  ≤   log 4(n / 5)  ≤   log 4n - 1. Arbitrarily discard vertices from SiS - 1 to create a smaller set S'iS - 1 with |S'iS - 1|  =  ⌈n / 5⌉, so that S'iS  =  N(S'iS - 1) has cardinality |S'iS|  ≥  4|S'iS - 1|  ≥  4n / 5.

Similarly, for an arbitrary b∈B, define [formula] by

[formula]

Again, we will find an index iT  ≤   log 4n whose modified set has cardinality |T'iT|  ≥  4n / 5.

With both |S'iS| and |T'iT| larger than n / 2, there must be some a'∈S'iS for which b' = φ(a')∈T'iT. This establishes the existence of an alternating walk and hence (removing any cycles) an alternating path of length at most 2(iS + iT)  ≤  2 log 4n from a to b in [formula].

We will need the following lemma,

Suppose that [formula], and [formula] are independent random variables with Yi distributed as the kith minimum of N independent exponential rate one random variables. If μ > 1 then

[formula]

Let Y(k) denote the kth smallest of [formula], where we assume that k = O( log N). Then the density function fk(x) of Y(k) is

[formula]

and hence the ith moment of Y(k) is given by

[formula]

Thus, if 0  ≤  t < N - k + 1,

[formula]

If [formula] then if 0  ≤  t < N - a log N,

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

We put t = (N - a log N)(1 - 1 / μ) to minimise the above expression, giving

[formula]

W.h.p., for all φ, the weighted ab-diameter of [formula] is at most [formula] for some absolute contant c1 > 0.

Let

[formula]

where the maximum is over sequences [formula] where (xi,yi) is one of the 40 shortest arcs leaving xi for [formula], and (yi,xi + 1) is a backwards matching edge.

We compute an upper bound on the probability that Z1 is large. For any ζ > 0 we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula] are independent and Xj is distributed as the ρjth minimum of r independent exponential random variables. (When k = 0 there is no term [formula]).

Explanation: The o(n- 4) term is for the probability that there is a vertex in Vr that has fewer than (1 - o(1))np neighbors in Vr. We have at most ((r + 1)n)k + 1 choices for the sequence [formula]. The term [formula] bounds the probability that the sum of k independent exponentials, [formula], is in [formula]. (The density function for the sum of k independent exponentials is [formula].) We integrate over y. [formula] is the probability that (xi,yi) is and edge of G and is the ρith shortest edge leaving xi, and these events are independent for 0  ≤  i  ≤  k. The factor pk - 1 is the probability that the B to A edges of the path exist. The final summation bounds the probability that the associated edge lengths sum to at least [formula].

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemFG] with a  ≤  3,N = (1 + o(1))np,μ = (ζ + y) / a that if ζ is sufficiently large then, for all y  ≥  0,

[formula]

Since the number of choices for [formula] is at most [formula] (the number of positive integral solutions to [formula]) we have

[formula]

for ζ sufficiently large.

Lemma [\ref=shortpaths] shows that with probability 1 - o(n- 4) in going from Mr to Mr + 1 we can find an augmenting path of weight at most [formula]. This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem3] and Theorem [\ref=th1]. (Note that to go from w.h.p. to expectation we use the fact that w.h.p. w(e) = O( log n) for all e∈A  ×  B,) [formula]

Notice also that in the proof of Lemmas [\ref=cl1] and [\ref=shortpaths] we can certainly make the failure probability less than n- K for any constant K > 0.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th2]

Just as the proof method for Kn,n in [\cite=W1], [\cite=W2] can be modified to apply to Gn,n,p, the proof for Kn in [\cite=W0] can be modified to apply to Gn,p.

Outline of the proof

This has many similarities with the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1]. The differences are subtle. The first is to let M*r be the minimum cost matching of size r after ading a special vertex vn + 1. It is again important (Lemma [\ref=lem10]) to estimate the probability that vn + 1∈M*r. The approach is similar to that for Theorem [\ref=th1], except that we now need to prove separate lower and upper bounds for this probability P(n,r).

Proof details

Consider G  =  Gn,p, and denote the vertex set by [formula]. Add a special vertex vn + 1 with E(λ)-cost edges to all vertices of V, and let G* be the extended graph on [formula]. Say that [formula] are ordinary. Let M*r be the minimum cost r-matching (one of size r) in G*, unique with probability one. (Note the change in definition.) Define P(n,r) as the normalized probability that vn + 1 participates in M*r, i.e.

[formula]

Let C(n,r) denote the cost of the cheapest r-assignment of G. To estimate C(n,r), we will again need to estimate P(n,r), by the following lemma.

[formula]

Let X  =  C(n,r) and Y  =  C(n - 1,r - 1). Fix i∈[n] and let w be the cost of the edge (vi,vn + 1), and let I denote the indicator variable for the event that the cost of the cheapest r-assignment that contains this edge is smaller than the cost of the cheapest r-assignment that does not use vn + 1. The rest of the proof is identical to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem10a], except that there are now n choices for i as opposed to r in the previous lemma.

In this case, unlike the bipartite case, we are unable to directly find an asymptotic expression for P(n,r), as we did in Lemma [\ref=lem3] and Corollary [\ref=corollary1]. Here we will have to turn to bounding P(n,r) from below and above.

A lower bound for P(n,r)

We will consider an algorithm that finds a set As  ⊆  V* which contains the set Bs of vertices participating in M*r, s  =  |As|  ≥  |Bs|  =  2r. Call As the set of exposed vertices.

Initially let [formula] and r  =  s  =  0. At stage s of the algorithm we condition on

As,Bs and the existence and cost of all edges within As. In particular, we condition on r and the minimum r-matching M*r.

Given a minimum matching M*r, we decide how to build a proposed (r + 1)-matching by comparing the following numbers and picking the smallest.

za equals the cost of the cheapest edge between a pair of unexposed vertices.

[formula], where c1(v) is the cost of the cheapest edge between v and a vertex τ1(v)∉As.

zc  =   min {c1(v)  +  c1(u)  +  δ(u,v):u,v∈Bs} where δ(u,v) denotes the cost of the cheapest alternating path from u to v, with the cost of edges in M*r taken as the negative of the actual value.

Let

[formula]

If zmin = za then we reveal the edge {v,w} and add it to M*r to form M*r + 1. Once v,w have been determined, they are added to As and Bs, and we move to the next stage of the algorithm, updating s←s + 2,r←r + 1.

If zmin = zb then let [formula] be the vertex with the cheapest c1(v). We reveal w = τ1(v) and add w to As and to Bs while adding v to Bs. Now [formula]. We move to the next stage of the algorithm, updating s←s + 1,r←r  +  1.

If zmin = zc then reveal w1  =  τ1(u),w2  =  τ1(v). If w1  =  w2, we say that we have a collision. In this case, the vertex w1 is added to As (but not Bs), and we move to the next stage with s←s + 1. If there is no collision, we update M*r by the augmenting path [formula] to form M*r + 1. We add w1,w2 to As and Bs, and move on to the next stage with s←s  +  2 and r←r + 1.

It follows that [formula] consists of unmatched vertices that have been the subject of a collision.

It will be helpful to define As for all s, so in the cases where two vertices are added to As, we add them sequentially with a coin toss to decide the order.

The possibility of a collision is the reason that not all vertices of As participate in M*r. However, the probability of a collision at vn + 1 is O(λ2), and as λ  →  0 this is negligible. In other words, as λ  →  0,

[formula]

and we will bound [formula] from below.

Conditioning on vn + 1∉As, As is a random s-subset of V.

Trivial for s  =  0. Suppose As - 1 is a random (s - 1)-subset of V. Define Ns(v)  =  {w∉As:(v,w)∈E}. In stage s, if we condition on ds(v)  =  |Ns(v)|, then under this conditioning Ns(v) is a random ds(v)-subset of [formula]. This is because the constructon of As does not require the edges from As to [formula] to be exposed. So, if [formula] where w is added due to being the cheapest unexposed neighbor of an exposed v, then w is a random element of Ns(v) and hence a random element of [formula].

If we are in case (a), i.e. M*r + 1 is formed by adding an edge between two ordinary unexposed vertices v,w, then since we only condition on the size of the set {(v,w):v,w∉As}, all pairs [formula] are equally likely, and after a coin toss this can be seen as adding two random elements sequentially. We conclude that As is a random s-subset of V.

Recall that m  =  n  /  (ω1 / 2 log n).

W.h.p., for all 0  ≤  s  ≤  n - m and all v∈V,

[formula]

This follows from the Chernoff bounds as in Lemma [\ref=lem2].

We now bound the probability that [formula] from below. There are a few different ways this may happen.

We now have to address some cost conditioning issues. Suppose that we have just completed an iteration. First consider the edges between vertices not in As. For such an edge e, all we know is w(e)  ≥  ζ where ζ = zmin of the just completed iteration. So the conditional cost of such an edge can be expressed as ζ + E(1) or ζ + E(λ) in the case where e is incident with vn + 1. The exponentials are independent. We only need to compare the exponential parts of each edge cost here to decide the probability that an edge incident with vn + 1 is chosen.

We can now consider case (a). Suppose that an edge {u,v} between unexposed vertices is added to As - 1. By Corollary [\ref=cor2], there are at most [formula] ordinary such edges. There are n - s edges between vn + 1 and [formula], each at rate λ. As λ  →  0, the probability that one of the endpoints of the edge chosen in case (a) is vn + 1 is therefore at least

[formula]

We toss a fair coin to decide which vertex in the edge {u,v} goes in As. Hence the probability that [formula] in case (a) is at least

[formula]

We may also have [formula] if case (a) occurs at stage s - 2 and vn + 1 loses the coin toss, in which case the probability is at least

[formula]

Now consider case (b). Here only one vertex is added to As - 1, the cheapest unexposed neighbor w of some [formula]. The cost conditioning here is the same as for case (a), i.e. that the cost of an edge is ζ + E(1) or ζ + E(λ). By Corollary [\ref=cor2], this v has at most p(n - s + 1)(1 + ω- 1 / 5) ordinary unexposed neighbors, so the probability that w  =  vn + 1 is at least

[formula]

Finally, consider case (c). To handle the cost conditioning, we condition on the values c1(v) for v∈Bs. By well-known properties of independent exponential variables, the minimum is located with probability proportional to the rates of the corresponding exponential variables. A collision at vn + 1 has probability O(λ2), so assume we are in the case of two distinct unexposed vertices w1,w2. Suppose that w1 is revealed first. Exactly as in (b), the probability that w1  =  vn + 1 is at least

[formula]

If w1  ≠  vn + 1, the probability that w2  =  vn + 1 (i.e. [formula]) is at least

[formula]

so by considering the possibility that vn + 1 is the second vertex added from As - 2, we again have probability at least

[formula]

We conclude that no matter which case occurs, the probability is at least

[formula]

So

[formula]

Write

[formula]

An upper bound for P(n,r)

We now alter the algorithm above in such a way that A2r = B2r. We do not consider As for odd s here. At a stage with s  =  2r, we condition on

As, and the appearance and cost of all edges within As. In particular, we condition on r and the minimum r-matching M*r. A set Cs  ⊆  As, where each v∈Cs has been involved in a collision.

This changes how we calculate a candidate for M*r + 1. We now take the minimum of

za equals the cost of the cheapest edge between unexposed vertices.

[formula], where c1 and δ are as defined in Section [\ref=lowb].

zc  =   min {c1(u)  +  c2(v)  +  δ(u,v):u,v∈Cs,τ1(u)  =  τ1(v)}, where τ1 is defined in Section [\ref=lowb] and c2(v) is the cost of the second cheapest edge between v and a vertex τ2(v)∉As.

Let

[formula]

If zmin = za then we reveal the edge {v,w} and add it to M*r to form M*r + 1. Once v,w have been determined, they are added to As and we move to the next stage of the algorithm, updating s←s + 2.

If zmin = zb then reveal w1  =  τ1(u),w2  =  τ1(v). If w1  =  w2 then we add u,v to Cs and go to the next stage of the algorithm without changing s. (The probability that τ1(u)  =  τ1(v)  =  vn + 1 is O(λ2), and we can safely ignore this as λ  →  0). If at some later stage w1 is added to As and u say is still in As then we remove u from Cs. If w1  ≠  w2 then we update M*r by the augmenting path [formula] to form M*r + 1. We add w1,w2 to As, and move on to the next stage with s←s  +  2.

If zmin = zc then we update M*r by the augmenting path [formula] to form M*r + 1. We add w1,w2 to As, and move on to the next stage with s←s  +  2.

Eventually we will construct M*r + 1 since case (b) with τ1(u)  =  τ1(v) can happen at most s times before Cs  =  As.

The cost conditioning is the same as we that for computing the lower bound in Section [\ref=lowb], except for the need to deal with c2(v),v∈Cs. For this we condition on c2(v) and argue that the probability δ2(v) = x is proportional to the exponential rate for the edge (v,x). At this point we know that δ1(v)  ≠  vn + 1, since we are assuming λ is so small that this possibility can be ignored. So, in this case, we can only add vn + 1 as δ2(v) for some v∈Cs.

To analyze this algorithm we again need to show that A2r is a uniformly random subset of V.

Conditioning on vn + 1∉A2r, A2r is a random 2r-subset of V.

Let L denote the n  ×  n matrix of edge costs, where L(i,j) = w(vi,vj) and L(i,j) =   ∞   if edge (vi,vj) does not exist in G. For a permutation π of V let [formula] be defined by [formula]. Let X,Y be two distinct 2r-subsets of V and let π be any permutation of V that takes X into Y. Then we have

[formula]

where the last equality follows from the fact that L and [formula] have the same distribution. This shows that A2r is a random 2r-subset of V.

Let d2r(v)  =  |{w∉A2r:(v,w)∈E}|.

W.h.p., for all 0  ≤  r  ≤  (n  -  m)  /  2 and all v∈V,

The proof is again via Chernoff bounds, see Lemma [\ref=lem2].

We bound the probability that [formula] from above. Suppose we are at a stage where a collisionless candidate for M*r has been found.

In case (a), as in the previous section the probability that vn + 1 is one of the two unexposed vertices is at most

[formula]

Now suppose we are in case (b) with u,v∉C2r - 2. If no collision occurs, the probability that one of τ1(u),τ1(v) is vn + 1 is at most

[formula]

Finally, if we find M*r + 1 by alternating paths where one exposed vertex uses its second-cheapest edge to an unexposed vertex, the probability of that vertex being vn + 1 is even smaller at λ  /  (n - 2r + 1). So,

[formula]

Write

[formula]

Calculating [formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem10] and ([\ref=pklowbound]) we have

[formula]

by ([\ref=Young]).

The correction terms are easily taken care of. First we have

[formula]

Now we want to replace the (m + r) term in the logarithm in the RHS of [\eqref=add1] by r. For this we let m1  =  n  /  (ω1 / 4 log n)  =  mω1 / 4. Then

[formula]

So,

[formula]

Substituting y  =   log (1 / α  -  1) we have

[formula]

This proves a lower bound for [formula]. It also shows that

[formula]

For an upper bound, note that for r  ≤  (n - m) / 2,

[formula]

So,

[formula]

To get from [\eqref=to1] to [\eqref=to2] we use [\eqref=L=].

We show that for n even, [formula] to conclude that

[formula]

As above, this will follow from the following lemma.

Suppose n is even. If (n - m) / 2  ≤  r  ≤  n / 2 then [formula].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem13]

This section will replace Section [\ref=pol3]. Let [formula] for all v∈[n] be an arbitrary perfect matching of Gn,p. We let [formula] consist of two oppositely oriented copies of each edge of M. We then randomly orient the edges of Gn,p that are not in M and then add [formula] to obtain the digraph [formula]. Because np = ω( log n)2 we have that w.h.p. the minimum in- or out-degree in [formula] is at least ω( log n)2 / 3. Let D be the event that all in- and out-degrees are at least this large. Let the M-alternating diameter of [formula] be the maximum over pairs of vertices u  ≠  v of the minimum length of an odd length M-alternating path w.r.t. M between u and v where (i) the edges are oriented along the path in the direction u to v, (ii) the first and last edges are not in M. Given this orientation, we define [formula] to be the subdigraph of [formula] consisting of the r cheapest non-[formula] out-edges from each vertex together with [formula]. Once we can show that the M-alternating diameter of [formula] is at most ⌈3 log 3n⌉, the proof follows the proof of Lemma [\ref=shortpaths] more or less exactly.

W.h.p., the alternating diameter of [formula] is at most [formula].

We first consider the relatively simple case where np  ≥  n1 / 3 log n. Let N+(u) be the set of out-neighbors of u in [formula] and let N-(v) be the set of in-neighbors of v in [formula]. If there is an edge of [formula] from N+(u) to N-(v) then this creates an alternating path of length three. Otherwise, let N+  +(u) be the other endpoints of the matching edges incident with N+(u) and define N-  -(v) analogously. Note that now we have [formula] and given D, the conditional probability that there is no edge from N+  +(u) to N-  -(v) in [formula] is at most (1 + o(1))(1 - p)(np / 3)2  ≤  e- ( log n)3 / 10 = o(n- 2). Thus in this case there will be an alternating path of length five.

Now assume that np < n1 / 3 log n. In which case we can prove

[formula]

This follows from

[formula]

Imitating Lemma [\ref=cl1], we prove an expansion property for [formula]:

[formula]

Fix an arbitrary pair of vertices a,b. Define [formula] to be the set of vertices v such that there exists a directed M-alternating path of length 2i in [formula] from a to v. We let [formula] and given Si we let [formula] and [formula]. Here [formula] is the set of out-neighbors of S. N-(S) is similarly defined as the set of in-neighbors. It follows from [\eqref=smallS] and [\eqref=expand] that w.h.p. |Si''|  ≥  3|S|, so long as |Si| = o(n7 / 12). We therefore let Si + 1 be a subset of Si'' of size 3|Si|. So w.h.p. there exists an ia  ≤   log 3n such that |Sia|∈[n13  /  24,3n13  /  24].

Repeat the procedure with vertex b, letting T0  =  {b},Tj + 1'  =  N-(Tj) etc. By the same argument, there exists an jb  ≤   log 3n such that Tjb is of size in

[formula]

The remainder of the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem13] is now exactly as in Section [\ref=pol3]. This concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th2].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thtal]

The proof of Lemma [\ref=shortpaths] allows us to claim that for any constant K > 0, with probability 1 - O(n- K) the maximum length of an edge in the minimum cost perfect matching of G is at most [formula] for some constant c2 = c2(K) > 0. We can now proceed as in Talagrand's proof of concentration for the assignment problem. We let [formula] and let Ĉ(G) be the assignment cost using ŵ in place of w. We observe that

[formula]

and so it is enough to prove concentration of Ĉ(G).

For this we use the following result of Talagrand [\cite=tal]: consider a family F of N-tuples [formula] of non-negative real numbers. Let

[formula]

where [formula] are an independent sequence of random variables taking values in

[formula]

Final remarks

We have generalised the result of [\cite=A01] to the random bipartite graph Gn,n,p and the result of [\cite=W0] to the random graph Gn,p. It would be of some interest to extend the result in some way to random regular graphs. In the absence of proving Conjecture [\ref=conj1] we could maybe extend the results of [\cite=A01], [\cite=W0] to some special class of special graphs e.g. to the hypercube.
