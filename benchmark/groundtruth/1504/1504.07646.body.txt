Introduction

A closed orientable surface has a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic χ=2 - 2g, where the genus g is the number of holes in the surface. Nuclei as we now know them have the topology of a sphere with χ=2. Wheeler suggested that under appropriate conditions the nuclear fluid may assume a toroidal shape (χ=0). Using the liquid-drop model [\cite=Won73] and the rigid-body moment of inertia [\cite=Won78], it was shown that a toroidal nucleus, endowed with an angular momentum I=Iz aligned about its symmetry z-axis beyond a threshold, is stable against the breathing deformation in which the major radius R contracts and expands. The rotating liquid-drop nuclei can also be stable against sausage instabilities (know also as Plateau-Rayleigh instabilities, in which the torus breaks into smaller fragments), when the same mass flow is maintained across the meridian to lead to high-Iz isomers within an angular momentum window [\cite=Won78].

Recent Investigations on Rotating Toroidal Nuclei

Recently Ichikawa et al. [\cite=Ich12] found that toroidal high-spin isomer with I=60[formula] may be in a local energy minimum in the excited states of 40Ca. They used a cranked Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (HF) method starting from the initial ring configuration of 10 alpha particles. In Ref. [\cite=Ich14a] it was found from the time-dependent HF and the random-phase approximation that a collective rotation about the axis perpendicular to symmetry axis of the toroidal isomer 40Ca(I=60[formula]) can result in a pure collective precession motion. In our previous study [\cite=Sta14], we found that rotating toroidal nuclei have general occurrences and we located 18 even-even, N=Z, high-spin toroidal isomeric states: 28Si(I=44[formula]), 32S(I=48, 66[formula]), 36Ar(I=56, 72, 92[formula]), 40Ca(I=60, 82[formula]), 44Ti(I=68, 88, 112[formula]), 48Cr(I=72, 98, 120[formula]), and 52Fe(I=52, 80, 104, 132[formula]) in the region 16≤  A≤  52. Subsequent to the work of [\cite=Sta14], Ichikawa et al. in Ref. [\cite=Ich14b] investigated the existence of toroidal isomers and their precession motions for nuclei with 28≤  A≤  52. They also obtained high-spin toroidal isomers in 36Ar, 40Ca, 44Ti, 48Cr, and 52Fe, confirming the general occurrence of high-spin toroidal isomers in this mass region in [\cite=Sta14].

To study the occurrence of high-spin toroidal isomers we use a three-step method [\cite=Sta14], (see also [\cite=Sta08]). First, using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) model with the quadrupole moment constraints on Q20, we look for those oblate configurations with toroidal nuclear density distributions, as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. The energies of axially-symmetric toroidal configurations as a function of Q20 lie on a slope. This indicates that the magnitudes of the shell corrections are not sufficient to stabilize the tori against the tendency to return to the topology of a sphere.

We next take these toroidal configurations as the initial configurations in Q20-constrained cranking Skyrme-HF calculations. For a non-collectively rotating toroidal nucleus around the symmetry z-axis with aligned angular momentum, I=Iz, we use a Lagrange multiplier ω to describe the constraint Iz=〈Ĵz〉=[formula], where Ωzi is the z-component of i-th single-particle total angular momentum. When we locate the configurations which lie close to a local minimum for each quantized value of angular momentum, I=Iz, we repeat the cranked HF calculations without the Q20 constraint to find the high-spin toroidal isomeric states in free convergence in the last step. Results of this method in the case of 52Fe are shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig2].

From the quantum mechanical point of view, the non-collective rotation around the symmetry axis corresponds only to particle-hole (p-h) excitations in the axially-symmetric, I=0, nucleus. We plot in Fig. [\ref=Fig3] the I=0 toroidal proton-quasiparticle state energies as a function of the quadrupole moment Q20 obtained in SkM*-HFB model for 52Fe. The toroidal quasiparticle states are labelled by asymptotic quantum numbers Ω. It is clear from Fig. [\ref=Fig3], and also Fig. 1(a) in Ref. [\cite=Sta14], that the low-lying states possess the nodal quantum number of nz=0. The occupation numbers of 14, 18, 22, and 26 in Fig. [\ref=Fig3] indicate the toroidal shell-gaps, as in Fig. 1(a) of [\cite=Sta14]. The occupation of all levels below the Fermi energy of this even-even nucleus lead to the state with I=0, while the 2p-2h and 3p-3h particle-hole excitation result to high-spin toroidal isomeric states with Iz=26 and 40[formula], respectively.

Table [\ref=table1] gives the simple rules to calculate the aligned angular momentum I=Iz for different p-h excitations from states with nz=0, for neutron number N (or proton number Z), such that (N or Z mod 4)= 0 or 2. For nucleus 52Fe with N=Z=26 and a parameter Λmax=6, one can find from Table [\ref=table1] the aligned angular momentum Iz=2×  14, 2×  26, 2×  40, 2×  52, 2×  66[formula] for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-p-h excitations, (see also Fig. 1(b) in Ref. [\cite=Sta14]). With our method to study the occurrence of toroidal high-spin isomers described above, all the above p-h states turn out to be toroidal isomeric states as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig2], with the exception of the (1p-1h) Iz=28[formula] state that is apparently below the threshold for a non-collectively rotating toroidal nucleus.

We plot in Fig. [\ref=Fig4] the density distributions of the isomeric toroidal states of 52Fe (presented in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]) with I= 52, 80, 104, and 132[formula] as a cut in the radial direction x. One notes that when the aligned angular momentum I increases, the maximum toroidal density ρmax decreases from 0.134 to 0.123 fm- 3 and the major radius R increases from 7.39 to 8.20 fm. Only the minor radius d, defined as a half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the toroidal distribution, stays constant at d  ≈  1.37 fm. For comparison, we also show the total density distribution of 52Fe in its ground state (dash-dot curve) with ρmax=0.173 fm- 3 which is distinctly larger than ρmax of toroidal distributions. The above-mentioned features are typical for all high-spin toroidal isomeric states of even-even, Z=N nuclei with 28≤  A≤  52, (see Table 1 in Ref. [\cite=Sta14]).

In Fig. [\ref=Fig5] we plot the total energy of all found isomers as a function of R / d. One can see that the total energies of isomers obtained by the same p-h excitation show linear dependence on R / d. There appears to be a regular pattern on the systematics of high-spin toroidal isomers from which properties on the nuclear fluid in the exotic toroidal shape may be extracted.

Conclusion

Non-collective nuclear rotations with a large angular momentum provide a favorable environment for the nuclear matter to redistribute itself. Our exploration of the density distribution of these nuclei with cranked self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach in the region of 28≤  A  ≤  52 reveals the possibility of toroidal-shape high-spin isomers at their local energy minima, when the angular momenta are greater than some large thresholds. The particle-hole nature of these non-collective rotational states, the locations of these local energy minima, the magnitudes of the non-collective angular momenta, and the geometrical properties of these isomeric states have been systematically evaluated for further theoretical and experimental explorations.
