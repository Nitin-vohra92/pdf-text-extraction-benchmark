Ground-state phase diagram of the square lattice Hubbard model from density matrix embedding theory

The Hubbard model [\cite=PhysRevLett.10.159] [\cite=Kanamori01091963] [\cite=hubbard1963electron] is one of the simplest quantum lattice models of correlated electron materials. Its one-band realization on the square lattice plays a central role in understanding the essential physics of high temperature superconductivity [\cite=Zhang1988] [\cite=Dagotto1994]. Rigorous, near exact results are available in certain limits [\cite=scalapino2007numerical]: at high temperatures from series expansions [\cite=PhysRevB.77.033101] [\cite=PhysRevLett.97.187202] [\cite=Khatami2011] [\cite=Khatami2015] [\cite=PhysRevB.31.4403], in infinite dimensions from converged dynamical mean-field theory [\cite=georges1992hubbard] [\cite=Georges1996] [\cite=PhysRevB.86.125114], and at weak coupling from perturbation theory [\cite=schweitzer1991weak] and renormalization group analysis [\cite=halboth2000renormalization] [\cite=raghu2010superconductivity]. Further, at half-filling, the model has no fermion sign problem, and unbiased determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations can be converged [\cite=PhysRevB.80.075116]. Away from these limits, however, approximations are necessary. Many numerical methods have been applied to the model at both finite and zero temperature, including fixed node, constrained path, determinantal, and variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [\cite=PhysRevB.58.R14685] [\cite=Becca2000] [\cite=PhysRevLett.72.2442] [\cite=Tocchio2008] [\cite=PhysRevB.55.7464] [\cite=PhysRevB.78.165101] [\cite=Chang2010] [\cite=yokoyama1987variational] [\cite=PhysRevB.76.180504] [\cite=yamaji1998variational] [\cite=PhysRevB.43.12943], density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [\cite=white2000phase] [\cite=scalapino2001numerical] [\cite=white2003stripes], and dynamical cluster (DCA) [\cite=PhysRevB.58.R7475] [\cite=PhysRevB.61.12739] and (cluster) dynamical mean-field theories (CDMFT) [\cite=Lichtenstein2000] [\cite=PhysRevLett.87.186401]. These have revealed rich phenomenology in the phase diagram including metallic, antiferromagnetic, d-wave (and other kinds of) superconducting phases, a pseudogap regime, and inhomogeneous orders such as stripes, and charge, spin, and pair-density waves [\cite=scalapino2007numerical].

Here, we employ density matrix embedding theory (DMET) [\cite=Knizia2012] [\cite=Knizia2013], together with clusters of up to 16 sites and thermodynamic extrapolation, to compute a calibrated ground-state phase diagram for the Hubbard model. We use the term calibrated as we provide an error model to estimate the quality of the results, and by proxy, the complexity of the underlying physics. The one-band (frustrated) Hubbard model on the L  ×  L square lattice is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denote nearest and next-nearest neighbors, respectively, [formula] destroys (creates) a particle on site i with spin σ, and [formula] is the number operator. The standard Hubbard model corresponds to t' = 0 (we fix t = 1). We further study the frustrated model with t' =   ±  0.2.

DMET is a cluster impurity method which is exact for weak coupling (U = 0) and weak hybridization (t = 0) and which becomes exact for arbitrary U as the cluster size Nc increases. It differs from Green function impurity methods such as the DCA or (C)DMFT, as it is a wavefunction method, with a finite bath constructed to reproduce the entanglement of the cluster with the remaining lattice sites without bath discretization error. DMET has recently been applied and benchmarked in a variety of settings from lattice models [\cite=Knizia2012] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.165134] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.035140] [\cite=PhysRevB.91.195118] to ab-initio calculations with realistic long-range interactions [\cite=doi:10.1021/ct500512f] [\cite=bulik2014electron], and for ground-state and spectral quantities [\cite=Booth2013]. In its ground-state formulation, the use of wavefunctions substantially lowers the cost relative to Green function impurity methods, allowing larger clusters to become computationally affordable.

We briefly summarize the method here, with details in the supplementary information and original references [\cite=Knizia2012] [\cite=Knizia2013]. DMET maps the problem of solving for the bulk ground-state [formula] (on the L  ×  L lattice for L sufficiently large) to solving for the ground-state of an impurity model with Nc impurity and Nc bath sites. The exact mapping is defined via the Schmidt decomposition [\cite=Peschel2012] of the exact [formula], where [formula] denotes impurity states, and [formula], bath states. The bulk [formula] can be expressed exactly in the Schmidt subspace [formula] and is the ground state of the impurity Hamiltonian defined as [formula], [formula], thus establishing the exact ground-state bulk to impurity mapping. In practice, however, the exact [formula] is, of course, unknown! DMET therefore solves an approximate impurity problem defined from a model bulk wavefunction [formula], the ground-state of a quadratic Hamiltonian h = h0 + u, where h0 is one-body part of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, and u is a one-body operator acting in each cluster unit cell of the bulk lattice, to be determined. Via [formula] we define the bath space, impurity Hamiltonian, and impurity model ground-state [formula] (which is now an approximation to the exact bulk wavefunction [formula]) and from which energies and local observables can be measured. Under this approximation, the bath Hilbert space spanned by [formula] (of equal size to the impurity Hilbert space) becomes isomorphic to the Fock space of Nc (one-particle) sites, i.e. the bath sites. All these quantities are functions of the one-body operator u, which is determined self-consistently by matching the one-particle density matrix of the impurity wavefunction [formula], and the model lattice wavefunction [formula], corresponding to the optimization [formula], where i,j label impurity and bath sites. In this work, we used two small modifications of the original DMET procedure in Ref. [\cite=Knizia2012]. First, we allowed u to vary over particle non-conserving terms, thus allowing [formula] to spontaneously break particle number symmetry in order to describe superconducting phases. Second, we used an additional chemical potential on the impurity sites, to ensure that the impurity fillings for [formula] and [formula] exactly match.

To obtain the ground-state phase diagram, we carried out DMET calculations using 2×  2, 4×  2, 8×  2, and 4×  4 impurity clusters, cut from a bulk square lattice with L = 72. We considered t' = 0,0.2, - 0.2, and U = 2,4,6,8, and various densities between n = 0.6 - 1. The impurity model ground-state [formula] was determined using a DMRG solver with a maximum number of renormalized states M = 2000, and which allowed for U(1) and SU(2) symmetry breaking. The energy, local moment [formula], double occupancy [formula], and local d-wave pairing [formula] were measured from [formula].

The finite cluster DMET energies and measurements contain 3 sources of error relative to the exact thermodynamic limit. These are from (i) errors in the DMET self-consistency, (ii) finite M in the DMRG solver (only significant for the 8  ×  2 and 4  ×  4 clusters, corresponding to 32 impurity plus bath sites in the impurity model), which also induces error in the correlation potential u, (iii) finite impurity cluster size. (The error from the use of a finite 72  ×  72 bulk lattice, is so small as to not affect any of the significant digits presented here). To estimate the thermodynamic result, we (i) estimated DMET self-consistency quality by the convergence of expectation values in the last iterations, (ii) extrapolated DMRG energies and expectation values at finite M to infinite M, using the linear relation with DMRG density matrix truncation error [\cite=white2007neel], (iii) estimated the error in u due to finite M, by extrapolating expectation values from self-consistent u(M) obtained with different solver accuracy, (iv) extrapolated cluster size to infinite size, with the scaling N- 1 / 2c appropriate to a non-translationally-invariant impurity. Each of (i) to (iv) gives an estimate of an uncertainty component (for linear extrapolations, we use the 1σ standard deviation), which we combined to obtain a single error bar on the DMET thermodynamic estimates. Details of the error estimation and a discussion of the complete data (of which only a fraction is presented here) are given in the supplementary information.

We first verify the accuracy of our thermodynamic estimates and error bars by comparing to benchmark data available at half-filling. In Table [\ref=tab:energy] and Fig. [\ref=fig:benchmark], we compare the DMET ground-state energy, double occupancies, and staggered magnetization with exact estimates at half-filling, as obtained from ground-state (auxiliary field) determinantal QMC (AFQMC) calculations on finite square lattices extrapolated to infinite size [\cite=zhang_private], and DMRG on long open cylinders, extrapolated to infinite width and length [\cite=white_private]. For comparison, we also show recent DCA energies computed at the lowest published temperatures, T = 0.05 - 0.15t [\cite=PhysRevB.88.155108].

The data shows the high accuracy of the DMET energies at half-filling. The error bars from DMET, AFQMC, and DMRG are all consistent. Except for U = 8 where the error is slightly larger, DMET provides the same number of significant digits as the "exact" AFQMC number with an accuracy better than 0.001t. As a point of reference, the uncertainties in the ground-state methods are significantly smaller than the finite temperature contributions to the low-temperature DCA calculations(Fig. [\ref=fig:benchmark](a)).

Figure [\ref=fig:benchmark](c) further gives the half-filling staggered magnetization and double occupancies computed with DMET, as compared with AFQMC. The DMET double occupancies are obtained with similar error bars to the "exact" AFQMC estimates. The DMET staggered magnetization, a non-local quantity, exhibits larger errors at the smallest U = 2 (a cluster size effect) but for U > 4 appears similarly, or in fact more accurate than the AFQMC result. At the largest value U = 12, we find m = 0.327(15), slightly above the exact Heisenberg value [\cite=PhysRevB.56.11678].

The half-filling benchmarks lend confidence to the DMET thermodynamic estimates of the energy and observables, and their associated error bars. We therefore use the same error model to estimate the accuracy of the DMET energies and expectation values away from half-filling, in the absence of benchmark data. Although exact thermodynamic limit results are not available away from half-filling, we can verify our error model at low density using constrained path (CP) AFQMC, a sign-free QMC with a bias that disappears at low density and small U [\cite=PhysRevB.55.7464] [\cite=PhysRevB.78.165101]. For U = 4 and [formula], a parameter regime where CP-AFQMC is very accurate, the DMET and CP-AFQMC energies agree to 0.001t (Table [\ref=tab:energy]). Fig. [\ref=fig:benchmark](b) shows the energy uncertainties across the phase diagram for t' = 0. (The same figure for t' =   ±  0.2 is given in the supplementary information, which, in general, displays smaller error than t' = 0). As expected, the accuracy away from half-filling is significantly lower than at half-filling, with the largest errors found in the underdoped region of n=0.8-0.9. The main source of error is from cluster size extrapolation, especially in the underdoped region. Large errors can be viewed as reflecting underlying physics, as they coincide (see below) with phase boundaries and/or the onset of competing inhomogeneous orders, both of which are sensitive to cluster shape, and thus lead to errors in extrapolation.

We present the DMET phase diagrams in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase]. We observe (i) an AF phase at half-filling, (ii) a metallic phase at large dopings and at small U, enhanced by frustration, (iii) a region of d-wave SC order at intermediate dopings and sufficiently large U, (iv) a region of coexisting AF and SC order, (v) a region with various inhomogeneous charge, spin, and superconducting orders, (vi) points in between the AF and SC phase where the AF and SC orders extrapolate to zero. (The metallic phase is predicted, to be unstable at very weak coupling and large dopings from weak coupling expansions [\cite=Metzner1989] [\cite=raghu2010superconductivity], but this is associated with an exponentially small energy scale not probed here). Fig. [\ref=fig:U4order] shows the average AF and d-wave SC order parameters as a function of filling for U=4. We find that t' = 0.2 stabilizes AF versus SC, and the reverse is true for t' =  - 0.2. For t' = 0, the peak in SC order is around 〈n〉 = 0.9 and SC extends to 〈n〉  ~  0.8. The figures also show the suppression (enhancement) of SC order with positive (negative) t'. As positive (negative) t[formula] corresponds to electron-(hole-)doped cuprates, our results are consistent with the stronger superconductivity found in hole-doped materials [\cite=Pavarini2001] [\cite=Huang2001] [\cite=Eberlein2014].

The presence of SC in the Hubbard model ground-state has previously been much discussed. From the Mermin-Wagner theorem, long-range order is not allowed at finite temperatures [\cite=PhysRevLett.17.1133] [\cite=0953-8984-13-27-201] [\cite=Schaefer2015], but at zero temperature, such long-range order can exist. In a cluster mean-field approach embodied by cluster DMET (and similarly CDMFT) a concern is that the observation of local order in finite clusters does not translate into true long-range order. However, our estimates indicate that a homogeneous SC order parameter survives in the infinite cluster limit, within the error bars of our extrapolation.

At t' = 0, we observe a banana-shaped SC region. At U = 6 and n = 0.875 (between the AF and SC phases) we find that the AF and SC order parameters are nonzero in finite clusters, but extrapolate to 0 in the thermodynamic limit. However, for the analogous U = 8, n = 0.875 point, a SC state with strong inhomogeneity appears which creates large uncertainties in the extrapolated order parameters, thus the precise location of the SC phase boundary at U = 8 is uncertain.

We now further discuss the intermediate region between the AF and SC phases (low doping and large U). In this region, a variety of spin-density [\cite=Scalapino1986] [\cite=Schulz1990] [\cite=Kato1990] [\cite=Chang2010] [\cite=PhysRevB.89.155134] [\cite=leprevost2015intertwined] charge-density [\cite=Poilblanc1989] [\cite=Vojta1999] [\cite=Melikyan2005] [\cite=Chang2010], pair-density wave [\cite=Chen2004a] [\cite=Melikyan2005] [\cite=Lee2014] [\cite=berg2009charge], and stripe orders [\cite=white1998density] [\cite=Hellberg1999] [\cite=white2000phase] [\cite=white2003stripes] [\cite=Hager2005] [\cite=Corboz2011] [\cite=leprevost2015intertwined], have been posited in both the Hubbard model and the simpler t-J model. These inhomogeneous phases are proposed to be relevant in the pseudogap physics [\cite=Moshchalkov2001] [\cite=Fleck2001] [\cite=Chen2004a] [\cite=valla2006ground] [\cite=Li2006] [\cite=Sedrakyan2010] [\cite=Lee2014]. Recent projected entangled pair state (PEPS) studies of the t-J model suggest that different inhomogeneous and homogeneous states are near degenerate at low doping [\cite=Corboz2011]. Our work indicates that the Hubbard model behaves similarly. For large U and low doping n = 0.875 - 0.8 we find some points (marked (g) in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase]) where the AF and SC order parameters are small or vanish, but also many other points with various inhomogeneous orders. Some representative examples of inhomogeneous states are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:stripes]. These correspond to (i) a local phase separation between a half-filled, antiferromagnetic phase and a superconducting ribbon (Fig. [\ref=fig:stripes](a)), (ii) a classic stripe phase order, with a period 4 charge and period 8 spin density modulation (Fig. [\ref=fig:stripes](b)), very similar to as seen in earlier DMRG ladder studies [\cite=white2003stripes]. There is also a coexisting weak PDW (exhibiting a sign change across the cell), consistent with earlier stripe proposals [\cite=berg2009charge]. (iii) Inhomogeneities in the pairing order coexisting with the charge and spin orders in, eg., Fig. [\ref=fig:stripes](c) where we see a PDW with an 8 unit cell wavelength coexisting with a CDW with a 4 unit cell wavelength and a 8 unit cell SDW. The PDW is all positive (on the ladders) indicating coexistence with superconductivity, similar to a recent theoretical proposal (see e.g. Ref. [\cite=Lee2014]). The inhomogeneity is mainly observed with zero or negative t', corresponding to the hole-doped cuprates. Fig. [\ref=fig:stripes](d) shows an example with t' = 0.2, where the inhomogeneity is much weaker than in the [formula] cases. Although only 8  ×  2 clusters are shown above, not all 8  ×  2 clusters are inhomogeneous, and similarly not all 4  ×  4 clusters are homogeneous. A detailed analysis of observed inhomogeneous phases, and the determination of the phase diagram, is presented in the supplementary information. While the impurity clusters we use are still too small to definitively resolve the competing orders, they hint at the possible behaviour and energy resolution required to determine the ground state at various points in the phase space, and where we should focus our attention using larger clusters in future studies.

To summarize, we have computed a ground-state phase diagram for the Hubbard and frustrated Hubbard models on the square lattice using cluster DMET. At half-filling, the accuracy achieved by DMET appears competitive with the best exact benchmarks, while away from half-filling our error model suggests that the calculations remain very accurate. We observe standard AF and metallic phases, regions of d-wave SC pairing order, and several kinds of inhomogeneities. At special points in the phase diagram, the inhomogeneous and homogeneous solutions associated with 8  ×  2 and 4  ×  4 clusters are very close in energy and definitive characterization will require higher energy resolution with larger clusters. However, for real materials such as the cuprates, assuming t  ≈  3000K, the energy resolution achieved here for most of the phase diagram is already below the superconducting transition temperature, suggesting that the near degeneracy of these orders will be lifted by terms beyond those in the Hubbard model, such as long range charge and hopping terms, multi-orbital effects, and interlayer coupling. Moving beyond the Hubbard model to more realistic material models thus now appears of principal relevance.
