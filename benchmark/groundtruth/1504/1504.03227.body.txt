New Congruences on Multiple Harmonic Sums and Bernoulli Numbers

Introduction

It is well known that the n-th Bernoulli number Bn is defined by the series

[formula]

For example, [formula] and B2n + 1 = 0 for all n  ≥  1. There are many fascinating congruences related to some special sums and Bernoulli numbers. For instance, using partial sum of multiple zeta series, Zhao [\cite=Zhao1] proved that for any prime p  ≥  3,

[formula]

By using some combinatorial identities, Ji [\cite=Ji] gave a simple proof of this congruence. Zhou and Cai [\cite=zhouxia] gave a generalization by establishing a congruence involving arbitrary number of variables. Namely, they showed that

[formula]

where p  ≥  5 is a prime and n  ≤  p - 2 is a positive integer.

In 2014, by replacing prime p to prime power, the author and Cai [\cite=WangCai] gave a new generalization of ([\ref=zhao1]). Let Pn denote the set of positive integers which are prime to n. We proved that for any prime p  ≥  3,

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=zhou]), it would be attractive to find some congruences similar to ([\ref=Wang]) by increasing the number of variables. For convenience, we define for 1  ≤  m  <  n that

[formula]

In particular, we also use Sn(pr) to represent S(1)n(pr) for convention.

Zhao [\cite=Zhaoarxiv] found an analogous congruence for S4(pr). He proved that for any prime p  ≥  5 and integer r  ≥  2,

[formula]

Recently, the author [\cite=Wang2015] solved the case when there are five variables. We proved that for any prime p  >  5 and integer r  ≥  2,

[formula]

For other related works, see [\cite=CaiShenJia]-[\cite=WangJcomb] and [\cite=Xia].

Following their steps, the goal of this paper is to find some analogous result for S6(pr). Firstly, we establish some congruences analogues to ([\ref=zhou]). These congruences are of independent interests themselves and will also be applied to give the modulo pr determination of S6(pr).

Let n be an even integer and p > n + 2 be a prime. Then

Let n be an even integer and p > n + 2 be a prime. Then

Secondly, utilizing these two congruences, we are able to solve the case of 6 variables. It is worthy mention that by using integer relation detecting tool PSLQ, Zhao [\cite=Zhaoarxiv] found that if there exists a constant [formula] such that for any r  ≥  2,

[formula]

then both the numerator and the denominator of c must have at least 60 digits. Our result below shows that the congruence satisfied by S6(pr) is different from ([\ref=Zhaoconj]).

Let p  ≥  11 be a prime and r  ≥  2 be an integer. We have

[formula]

As a by-product, we have

Let p  ≥  11 be a prime and n be a positive integer. Suppose pr|n but [formula] for some positive integer r. (i) If r = 1, then (ii) If r  ≥  2, then

In particular, if n = pr (r  ≥  2), then part (ii) of Theorem [\ref=thm2] becomes Theorem [\ref=thm1].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we collect some ingredients which will be used to prove the theorems above. In Sec. 3 we will prove Theorems [\ref=Rn2] and [\ref=Rn3] by using some properties of the p-restricted multiple harmonic sums defined by From these two theorems, we can determine S(k)6(p) for 1  ≤  k  ≤  5 modulo p. Then in Sec. 4 we establish the relation between S(k)6(pr + 1) and S(k)6(pr), from which Theorem [\ref=thm1] follows by induction on r. Finally, in Sec. 5 we give a rough predication of the general congruences about Rn(p) and Sn(pr) for any positive integer n. We also point out the difficulties to find the general congruences using the current method.

Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce some notations and lemmas which will be fundamental to our proofs.

We define for m  ≥  1 that The relation between R(m)n(p) and S(m)n(p) is given by the following lemma.

For any integers m and n, we have

[formula]

By Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we have This completes our proof.

We also define There are some relations between HN and UN. For example, let Sn denote the symmetric group of [formula]. It is easy to see that

[formula]

Let [formula] be positive integers, [formula], where p is a prime. For any positive integer b, we have

When b = 1, this has already been proved, see [\cite=zhouxia]. In particular, if b = n = 1, we obtain

[formula]

For all k  ≥  1, we have By ([\ref=Uspecial]) we see that Hence we have This proves the lemma for n = 1. Now assume the lemma is true when the number of variables is less than n. We have From the assumption above, we have If r is odd, then If r is even, similarly we can deduce The proof of Lemma [\ref=U] is complete by induction on n.

For fixed prime p, let C(m)a (1  ≤  a,m  ≤  5) denote the number of integer solutions [formula] of the equation

[formula]

We need the following facts.

For any prime p, we have (i) [formula]; (ii) [formula], [formula], [formula]; (iii) [formula], [formula], [formula] (iv) [formula], [formula], [formula].

By Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

In particular, we have

[formula]

Since 1  ≤  a  ≤  5, we have

[formula]

Hence from ([\ref=Camgen]) we see that [formula] (mod p) and (i) is proved.

Furthermore, from ([\ref=Xau]) we deduce that

[formula]

From ([\ref=Camexpress]) and ([\ref=Xauadd]), (ii)-(iv) follows by simple calculations.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=Rn2] and [\ref=Rn3]

Let [formula] for [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let m = 2 in ([\ref=start]). We have

[formula]

here we denote the three terms in the right hand side of ([\ref=sumformula]) by T1, T2 and T3 respectively. We will deal with these terms one by one.

For the first term, since n - 1 is odd, by ([\ref=HU]) and Lemma [\ref=U] we deduce that

[formula]

For the second term, according to ([\ref=HU]) and Lemma [\ref=U], we have

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Now we calculate the third term. For 2  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2, from ([\ref=HU]) and Lemma [\ref=U] we obtain that Therefore, we have

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=T1])-([\ref=T3]) into ([\ref=sumformula]), we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=Rn2].

Now we are able to determine S(2)n(p) modulo p.

Let n be an even integer and p > n + 2 be a prime. We have

From ([\ref=zhou]) we know [formula] (mod p). By Lemma [\ref=RSrelation], we obtain

[formula]

The corollary then follows from Theorem [\ref=Rn2].

Let m = 3 in ([\ref=start]). We have

[formula]

here we denote the four sums in the bracket by T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively.

For the first sum in ([\ref=Rn3start]), we have

[formula]

For a = 1 or 2, by ([\ref=HU]) and Lemma [\ref=U] we have

[formula]

According to j = i + 1 or not, we split the third sum in ([\ref=T1start]) into two parts. For the case j  ≠  i + 1, replacing uk by uk - 1 + p for i < k  ≤  j or uk - 2 + 2p for k > j, applying ([\ref=HU]) and Lemma [\ref=U], we deduce that

[formula]

where the last congruence equality follows from the facts that

Similarly, for the case j = i + 1, replacing uk by uk - 1 + p for k = i + 1 or uk - 2 + 2p for k > i + 1, we have

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=aterm])-([\ref=minisum3]) into ([\ref=T1start]), we obtain

[formula]

For the second sum in ([\ref=Rn3start]), we have

[formula]

Since (i - 1) + (j - 1 - i) + (n - 1 - j) = n - 3 is odd, so at least one of i - 1, j - 1 - i and n - 1 - j must be odd. Hence we deduce that

[formula]

For the third sum in ([\ref=Rn3start]), we have

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=SumT32]) into ([\ref=SumT31]), we obtain that

[formula]

In the same way, we can show that

[formula]

Finally, substituting ([\ref=T1final]), ([\ref=SumT2]), ([\ref=SumT3]) and ([\ref=SumT4]) into ([\ref=Rn3start]), we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=Rn3].

Similar to the proof of Corollary [\ref=Sn2], we can give the determination of S(3)n(p) modulo p.

Let n > 4 be an even integer and p > n be a prime. We have

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=thm2]

By ([\ref=zhou]), Corollaries [\ref=Sn2] and [\ref=Sn3], we obtain

[formula]

From [\cite=Wang2015], for any r  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

Suppose 1  ≤  m  ≤  5 and r  ≥  1. For any 6-tuple [formula] of integers satisfying

[formula]

we rewrite them as

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we know there exists 1  ≤  a  ≤  5 such that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=Cam], we have [formula] (mod p) for 1  ≤  a  ≤  5. Hence for 1  ≤  j  ≤  6, we have

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Since [formula] (mod p), from ([\ref=internal]) we deduce that

[formula]

Let r = 1 in ([\ref=add1]). From ([\ref=S6pcong1]), ([\ref=S6pcong2]) and Lemma [\ref=Cam] we deduce that

[formula]

Now suppose for some r  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=add1]) and Lemma [\ref=Cam] we deduce that By induction on r, we complete our proof.

Let n = mpr, where p does not divide m. For any 6-tuple [formula] of integers satisfying [formula], li∈Pp, 1  ≤  i  ≤  6, we rewrite them as

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we know there exists 1  ≤  a  ≤  5 such that

[formula]

For 1  ≤  a  ≤  5, the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 = m - a has [formula] solutions (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6) of nonnegative integers. Hence

[formula]

According to r = 1 or r  ≥  2, we split our proof into two cases.

(i) If r = 1, then from ([\ref=S6pcong1]), ([\ref=S6pcong2]), and ([\ref=thm2rec]) we obtain Since [formula], we complete the proof of (i).

(ii) If r  ≥  2, since we have already proved that ([\ref=S6induction]) is true for all r  ≥  2, we deduce that [formula] (mod pr) and [formula] (mod pr). Again by ([\ref=internal]), we have

[formula]

Hence from ([\ref=thm2rec]) we obtain By Theorem [\ref=thm1], we have [formula] (mod pr). This completes the proof of (ii).

Concluding Remarks

As some examples for Theorems [\ref=Rn2] and [\ref=Rn3], for any prime p > 10 we have

If we wan to apply the method in [\cite=Wang2015] and the current paper to find the modulo pr determination for Sn(pr), the key step is to find the modulo p determination of S(m)n(p) for 1  ≤  m  <  n. Since S(1)n(p) has already been figured out by ([\ref=zhou]), we only need to consider the case m  ≥  2. Equivalently, Lemma [\ref=RSrelation] tells us that we only need to determine R(m)n(p) modulo p for m  ≥  2. However, as m increases, the computation becomes much more complicated. This is the major obstacle in solving the cases for large number of variables. Nevertheless, from the process of determining R(2)n(p) and R(3)n(p) presented in this paper, we believe that for any integers n  ≥  3 and 1  ≤  m  <  n, there exists some rational numbers [formula] and [formula] such that for any prime p > n + 2 and r  ≥  2, we have

[formula]

[formula]

here the sum on the right hand side runs over all possible tuples [formula] of odd integers such that

[formula]

For n  ≤  6, this has already been verified from Theorems [\ref=Rn2] and [\ref=Rn3] and the work of [\cite=WangCai] [\cite=Wang2015]. For n  ≥  7, we are able to guess what the congruence should look like. For example, the congruences for n = 8,9 should be of the forms
