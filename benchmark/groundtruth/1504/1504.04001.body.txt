Triangulable Leibniz Algebras

ABSTRACT: A converse to Lie's theorem for Leibniz algebras is found and generalized. The result is used to find cases in which the generalized property, called triangulable, is 2-recognizeable; that is, if all 2-generated subalgebras are triangulable, then the algebra is also. Triangulability joins solvability, supersolvability, strong solvability, and nilpotentcy as a 2-recognizeable property for classes of Leibniz algebras.

Simultaneous triangulation of a set of linear transformations related to Leibniz algebras will be considered in this work. A necessary condition is that the minimum polynomials of the linear transformations are the products of linear factors. If the matrices commute, then this condition is sufficient. Lie's theorem is a generalization of this result, a result that is field dependent even in the algebraically closed case. Lie's theorem extends to Leibniz algebras. It can also be useful to have a condition on the set which guarantees simultaneous triangulation when extending to the algebraic closure, K, of the field of scalars, F. We will call this property, borrowing from Bowman, Towers and Varea [\cite=Bowman], triangulable. Thus a Leibniz algebra A over a field F is triangulable on module M if the induced representation of [formula] on [formula] admits a basis such that the representing matrices are upper triangular. We find a condition on the Leibniz algebra that is equivalent to being triangulable. The condition is independent of the field and includes Lie's theorem. The condition is on A although triangulable refers to the action in the algebra that is over K. As an application, we consider to what extent an algebra is triangulable if all 2-generated subalgebras have the property. Such a property is called 2-recognizable, a concept investigated in groups, Lie algebras and Leibniz algebras for classes such as solvable, supersolvable, strongly solvable and, trivially, nilpotent and abelian. For an introduction to Leibniz algebras, see [\cite=Barnes], [\cite=Demir] and [\cite=Loday].

Let M be a module for the Leibniz algebra A. Let left and right multiplication by x∈A be denoted by Tx and Sx, respectively. If Tx is nilpotent, then Sx is also nilpotent and an Engle theorem holds; that is, A acts nilpotently on M [\cite=Bosko]. Define A to be nil on M if this property holds. If I is an ideal of a Leibniz algebra A, then I is nil on A if and only if I is nilpotent. We will show that A is triangulable on itself if and only if A2 is nilpotent. When A2 is nilpotent, then A is called strongly solvable, a term introduced in [\cite=Bowman].

Let B be an irreducible submodule of the A-module M such that dim(B)  =  1. Then A2  ⊆  CA(B) = {a∈A|aB = 0 = Ba}.

Let x,y∈A, b∈B with xb = αxb where αx is a scalar. Then (xy)b = x(yb) - y(xb) = x(αyb) - y(αxb) = αxαyb  -  αyαxb = 0. Since B is irreducible, it follows that b(xy) = 0 ([\cite=Barnes]). Hence A2B = BA2 = 0 and the result holds.

Let A be a Leibniz algebra and M be an A-module. There is a basis for M such that the representing matrices are in upper triangular form if and only if the linear transformations in the representation have minimum polynomials with all linear factors and A2 is nil on M.

We then have

Let A be a Leibniz algebra over an algebraically closed field and M be an A-module. There is a basis for M such that the representing matrices are in upper triangular form if and only if A2 is nil on M.

The condition on the minimum polynomials is equivalent to being able to triangulate all the linear transformations. Suppose also that A2 is nil on M. Then Tx, and hence Sx, is nilpotent for all x∈A2 ([\cite=Bosko]) and A2 acts nilpotently on M by Engel's theorem. Let B be an irreducible submodule of M. It is enough to show that dim(B) = 1 for then the result will follow by induction. Since the submodule BA2 + A2B is contained in B, BA2 + A2B is 0 or B. If the latter holds, then [formula], which is never 0, a contradiction. Hence BA2 + A2B = 0 and BA2 = 0 = A2B. Therefore, 0 = (xy)b = x(yb) - y(xb) for all x,y∈A, b∈B. Hence x(yb) = y(xb) and TxTy = TyTx. Since B is irreducible, either Sx = 0 for all x∈A or Sx =  - Tx for all x∈A [\cite=Barnes]. Then either TxSy =  - TxTy =  - TyTx = SyTx or TxSy = 0 = SyTx on B and SxSy = TxTy = TyTx = SySx or SxSy = 0 = SySx on B. Hence all Tx, Sy commute on B. Thus these transformations are simultaneously triangularizeable on B. Hence dim(B) = 1 and the result holds in this direction.

Suppose that there is a basis for M such that all the transformations are triangularizeable on this basis. Then there is a one dimensional submodule B such that A2B = 0 = BA2 by the lemma. A2 is nil on M / B by induction and hence on M. Since each transformation is triangularizeable, the minimum polynomials have linear factors.

We state these results when A is acting on itself. A is called strongly solvable if A2 is nilpotent ([\cite=Bowman], [\cite=Burch]). A is supersolvable if there is an increasing chain of ideal of A, each of codimension 1 in the next.

Let A be a Leibniz algebra over an algebraically closed field. Then A is supersolvable if and only if A is strongly solvable.

A is supersolvable if and only if A triangulable on itself. By Corollary [\ref=CorBasis], this is equivalent to A2 being nil on A which in turn is the same as A2 being nilpotent. The last statement is the definition of strongly solvable.

The general case looks like the following.

A is triangulable if and only if A2 is nil on A.

Let [formula] where K is the algebraic closure of the base field for A. If A2 is nil on A, then A2 is nilpotent as is (A2)* = (A*)2. Hence A* is supersolvable by the last result and A is triangulable by definition. The converse holds by reversing the steps.

A property is n-recognizeable in a class of algebras if whenever all n generated subalgebras have the property, then the algebra has the property. The concept when n = 2 has been considered in groups, Lie algebras and Leibniz algebras for classes that are solvable, supersolvable, nilpotent and strongly solvable (see [\cite=Brandl], [\cite=Burch], [\cite=Moneyhun]). A version of this has also been considered for triangulable in the Lie case in [\cite=Bowman]. We considered it as an application of our result.

In the class of solvable Leibniz algebras, triangulable is 2 recognizable.

Let N be a 2-generated subalgebra of A. Since N is triangulable, N2 is nil on N and, thus, N is strongly solvable. Therefore A is strongly solvable by [\cite=Burch] and A2 is nil on A. Then, using Theorem [\ref=Triangulable], A is triangulable.

The result can be extended from solvable to all algebras in characteristic 0, again using a result in [\cite=Burch].

For Leibniz algebras, triangulable is 2-recognizeable at characteristic 0.

Let A be a minimal counterexample. Simple Leibniz algebras are Lie algebras. Simple Lie algebras are 2-generated, hence A is triangulable. If I is a proper ideal in A, then all 2-generated subalgebras of I and A / I are strongly solvable by Theorem [\ref=Triangulable] and I and A / I are strongly solvable by Theorem 3 of [\cite=Burch] and A is solvable. The result holds by Theorem [\ref=TriRec].
