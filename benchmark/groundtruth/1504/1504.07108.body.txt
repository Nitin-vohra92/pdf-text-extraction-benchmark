Derivation of a BCn elliptic summation formula via the fundamental invariants

Introduction

In this paper we investigate the following multiple elliptic summation formula of type BCn: Under the conditions [formula] and a1a6  tn - 1 = q- N,

[formula]

for ξi = a1ti - 1 ([formula]), where we have used the standard notation

[formula]

of shifted factorials and theta functions of base p (|p| < 1). This summation formula was first conjectured by Warnaar [\cite=W2002], and proved by van Diejen-Spiridonov [\cite=vDS2000] in the case where p = 0, and by Rosengren [\cite=Ro2001] in the general case. The purpose of this paper is to give an alternative proof of the summation formula [\eqref=BCn-sum] based on the idea of the Jackson integrals and the associated q-difference de Rham cohomology. In our approach a certain family of fundamental BCn invariants plays an important role in analyzing the structure of this summation.

After formulating the summation formula [\eqref=BCn-sum] in terms of Jackson integrals in Section 2, we introduce in Section 3 a family of holomorphic functions Er(z) ([formula]), called fundamental invariants, which are characterized by a certain interpolation property. In Section 4 we establish two-term relations for the Jackson integrals involving Er(z). On the basis of these preparations, we give in Section 5 a proof of the summation formula [\eqref=BCn-sum]. This proof is based on q-difference equations for the Jackson integrals arising from the the two-term relations of Section 4.

Jackson integrals

We first rewrite the summation formula [\eqref=BCn-sum] in the terminology of Jackson integrals. For a function f(z) in n variables [formula], we denote by

[formula]

the Jackson integral of f(z) with a base point [formula], where

[formula]

We define a meromorphic function [formula] on the algebraic torus [formula] by

[formula]

with complex parameters ai = qαi ([formula]) and t = qτ, where

[formula]

denotes the Ruijsenaars elliptic gamma function [\cite=Ru1997]. Note that

[formula]

We remark that for each [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

and hence the νth summand of the left-hand side of [\eqref=BCn-sum] coincides with the value of Φ(qνz) / Φ(z) at z = ξ, under the condition [formula].

In order to rewrite [\eqref=BCn-sum] as a Jackson integral, we consider the multiplicative lattice

[formula]

with the base point [formula], under the condition a6a1tn - 1 = q- N. Notice that Φ(z) has poles along a6zn = qk ([formula]) which arise from the factor

[formula]

Hence, the points [formula] with νn  ≤  N are contained in the poles of Φ(z), since a6zn = q- N + νn for zn = a1tn - 1qνn. So as to avoid these poles, we modify Φ(z) as

[formula]

by multiplying a q-periodic function. Then we see that

[formula]

and that the lattice Λξ is contained in the domain of holomorphy of [formula]. Accordingly, it makes sense to consider the Jackson integral

[formula]

under the condition a1a6tn - 1 = q- N. Furthermore, one can verify that [formula] has zeros along

[formula]

which implies [formula] unless [formula]. Hence we see that the Jackson integral [\eqref=Jackson-sum] coincides with the left-hand side of [\eqref=BCn-sum] under the condition [formula]. Note also that, if N = 0, i.e. a6a1tn - 1 = 1, this sum reduces to a single term, giving 1.

Fundamental BCn invariants

In this section, we introduce a family of fundamental BCn invariant functions Er(a1,a2;z) [formula], which are characterized by an interpolation property.

We denote by [formula] the Weyl group of type Cn. This group acts on the space [formula] of holomorphic functions on [formula] through the permutations and the inversions of variables [formula]. We consider the [formula]-subspace [formula] consisting of all Wn-invariant holomorphic functions f(z) such that [formula], where Tp,zi stands for the p-shift operator in zi:

[formula]

The dimension of Hn as a [formula]-linear space is known to be n + 1. (See [\cite=Ito2008] [\cite=Ra2010].) For generic complex parameters (a1,a2) and t, we define a set of reference points [formula] ([formula]) by

[formula]

The [formula]-linear space Hn has a unique basis Er(z) = Er(a1,a2;z) [formula] such that

[formula]

where δrs is the Kronecker delta.

We call the holomorphic functions Er(z) ([formula]) of Theorem [\ref=thm:E2-basis] the (elliptic) fundamental Wn-invariants. We prove this theorem by explicitly constructing Er(z) ([formula]) with the interpolation property [\eqref=eq:E2-vanish].

In particular,

[formula]

When we need to specify the number of variables, we use the notation E(n)r(z) = Er(z). We first remark that these functions can also be defined inductively on the number of variables.

The functions E(n)r(z) [formula] satisfy the recurrence relation

[formula]

where [formula]. [formula]

It is immediately verified that these functions have the quasi-periodicity

[formula]

We next prove that Er(z) ([formula]) carry the interpolation property with respect to the reference points ζ(s) ([formula]),

Er(ζ(s)) = δrs for 0  ≤  r,s  ≤  n.

Proof. We take the summand of Er(z) corresponding to the division [formula] [formula], and look at its value at ζ(s). This term has zeros along the divisors

[formula]

On the other hand, the components of ζ(s) are given by

[formula]

When r > s, we have ζ(s)is + 1 = a2tis + 1 - s - 1 since is + 1  ≥  s + 1, and hence the factor for k = s + 1 vanishes. When r < s, we have ζ(s)j1 = a1tj1 - 1 since j1  ≤  r + 1  ≤  s, and hence the factor for l = 1 vanishes. When r = s and j1  ≤  r, we have ζ(r)j1 = a1tj1 - 1, and the factor for l = 1 vanishes. Hence the term corresponding to the division [formula] is nontrivial only when r = s and j1 = r + 1, namely [formula] and [formula]; in this case the corresponding term take the value 1 since

[formula]

[formula]

Notice that the linear independence of Er(z) ([formula]) follows from the interpolation property. In order to establish Theorem [\ref=thm:E2-basis], it remains to show the Wn-invariance of Er(z). Since Er(z) are invariant under the inversion of variables zi, we need to prove they are symmetric in the variables [formula]

For each [formula], Er(z) is symmetric in the variables [formula].

Proof. We prove this lemma by induction on the number of variables n. By the recurrence relation [\eqref=eq:E2-rec], E(n)r(z) = E(n)r(z',zn) are symmetric with respect to [formula]. Hence it suffices to show that they are invariant under the transposition of (zn - 1,zn), namely, E(n)r(z'',zn - 1,zn) = E(n)r(z'',zn,zn - 1), where [formula]. Using [\eqref=eq:E2-rec] twice, we have

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

By the so-called Riemann relation

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

as desired. [formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:E2-basis].

Two-term relations

As we have seen in Section 2, the left-hand side of [\eqref=BCn-sum] coincides with the Jackson integral [\eqref=Jackson-sum]. Hence our goal is to prove

[formula]

where [formula] and a1a6tn - 1 = q- N, if the balancing condition [formula] is satisfied. For that purpose, we investigate the q-difference equation to be satisfied by the left-hand side. In what follows, we always assume [formula], a6a1tn - 1 = q- N ([formula]) so that the Jackson integral makes sense as a finite sum. However, we do not impose any balancing condition on the parameters [formula] unless it becomes necessary.

Let φ(z) be a meromorphic function on [formula], and suppose that φ(z) is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the multiplicative lattice [formula]. Then by the q-shift invariance of Jackson integrals, for [formula] we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

In view of this property, we introduce the operator [formula] by setting

[formula]

for [formula]. In the notation

[formula]

of expectation values, the q-shift invariance of Jackson integrals is expressed as

[formula]

provided that φ(z) is holomorphic in an neighborhood of Λξ. In our case, from [\eqref=def-Phi] and [\eqref=wPhi-Phi] the ratio [formula] is explicitly written as

[formula]

In this section we prove two-term relations for the Jackson integrals 〈Er(z)〉 of the fundamental Wn-invariants Er(z) = Er(a1,a2;z) ([formula]).

Suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

where the coefficients cr are given by

[formula]

We remark that [\eqref=eq:ratio] can be rewritten as

[formula]

Hence this ratio is expressed as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note also that [formula].

Fixing an index [formula], for each [formula] we define a meromorphic function φi(z) by

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that φi(z) is holomorphic in a neighborhood of Λξ, [formula]. Then, from the definition ([\ref=eq:nabla]) of [formula] and ([\ref=eq:ratio2]), we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Here we set

[formula]

for [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq:q-Stokes]. Theorem [\ref=thm:2-term] is obtained by combining [\eqref=eq:<hr>] with the following lemma.

Suppose that [formula]. (1)  For each [formula], hr(z) belongs to the [formula]-linear space Hn of [\eqref=eq:def-Hn]. (2)  In terms of the fundamental Wn-invariants Es(z) [formula], hr(z) is expressed as

[formula]

where the coefficients cr,r and cr,r - 1 are given by

[formula]

Proof.  (1) Under the balancing condition [formula], by the explicit form [\eqref=eq:Fi] of F+i(z) and F-i(z) it is directly verified that hr(z) has the required quasi-periodicity. By the expression [\eqref=eq:def-hr], hr(z) is symmetric in the variables [formula]. The invariance with respect to the inversion zk  →  z- 1k follows from the Wn - 1-invariance of [formula] (i  ≠  k) and [formula]. It remains to show that hr(z) is holomorphic on [formula]. By the quasi-periodicity and the Wn-invariance, we have only to show that hr(z) has no pole along the divisors z1 / z2 = 1 and z21 = 1. It can be confirmed by

[formula]

and by the fact that [formula] is alternating with respect to the inversion z1  →  z- 11, respectively. (2) By Theorem [\ref=thm:E2-basis] hr(z) can be expressed as a linear combination of the fundamental Wn-invariants:

[formula]

By the definition [\eqref=eq:Fi], F-i(z) and F+i(z) [formula] satisfy the vanishing property

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

For [formula], we have

[formula]

Namely,

[formula]

Note that the formula above is valid in the case k = 0,n as well. Finally we obtain

[formula]

for [formula], which give the expressions of [\eqref=eq:crr]. [formula]

From this lemma, by [\eqref=eq:<hr>] we obtain cr,r〈Er(z)〉 + cr,r - 1〈Er - 1(z)〉  =  〈hr(z)〉 = 0, namely, 〈Er(z)〉 =  - cr〈Er - 1(z)〉 with cr = cr,r / cr,r - 1 [formula]. This gives the two-term relation [\eqref=eq:2-term].

Applying these two-term relations repeatedly, we obtain the formula connecting 〈En(z)〉 and 〈E0(z)〉.

Suppose that [formula]. Then one has

[formula]

Proof of the summation formula

In this section, we prove the summation formula [\eqref=BCn-Jackson-sum] on the basis of Theorem [\ref=thm:2-term] of the previous section.

In order to investigate the dependence the Jackson integral on the parameters (a5,a6), we set

[formula]

assuming that a6a1tn - 1 = q- N for some [formula]. Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

for [formula], including the case k = 6. This implies

[formula]

Then by Corollary [\ref=cor:EnE0] for (a5,a6), we obtain

[formula]

provided that [formula].

We now suppose that [formula] and a6a1tn - 1 = q- N. Then,

[formula]

which is obtained from [\eqref=eq:J=***J] replacing a5 with q- 1a5. Using this formula N times we have

[formula]

Since (qNa6)a1tn - 1 = 1, the Jackson integral J(q- Na5,qNa6) reduces to 1. Hence we obtain

[formula]

which coincides with [\eqref=BCn-Jackson-sum]. This completes the proof of the summation formula [\eqref=BCn-sum].
