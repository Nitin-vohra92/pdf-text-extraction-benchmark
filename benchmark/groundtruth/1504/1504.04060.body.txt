Vortex Equations Governing the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect

Introduction

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the study of field theoretic models governed by Chern-Simons theory [\cite=JHan] [\cite=Han] [\cite=Lieb] [\cite=CSLin] [\cite=Nam] [\cite=Spruck1] [\cite=Spruck2] [\cite=Spruck3] [\cite=Spruck4] [\cite=Tarantello1] [\cite=Tarantello2] [\cite=Tarantello3] [\cite=Wang] [\cite=Yang1] [\cite=Yang2] [\cite=Yang3] [\cite=Yang4]. These models generally lead to very complicated systems of non-linear equations, which have presented new challenges to mathematical analysts. Particularly, in condensed matter physics, Chern-Simons theory can be used to describe the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) [\cite=Cha] [\cite=Frolich1] [\cite=Frolich2] [\cite=Frolich3] [\cite=Girvin1] [\cite=Girvin2] [\cite=Ichinose1] [\cite=Ichinose2] [\cite=Jackiw] [\cite=Jain] [\cite=Klitzing] [\cite=Kohmoto] [\cite=McDonald] [\cite=Stone] [\cite=Thoules1] [\cite=Thoules2]. Ichinose and Sekiguchi [\cite=Ichinose2] established an effective theory for topological excitations in the generic (m,m,n) Halperin state in Chern-Simons gauge field theory, which describes the FQHE in double-layer 2-dimensional electron systems. Under the radially symmetric ansatz, Ichinose and Sekiguchi [\cite=Ichinose2], obtained a system of Toda-type equations, limited to single soliton configurations, and studied the numerical and qualitative behavior of soliton solutions.

In section 2, from the Lagrangian of the model, we get a coupled gauged Schrödinger equations governing the bosonized electron fields in the upper and lower layers, as well as, a set of constraint equations arising from the electromagnetic vector potential. In the static case and by ignoring long-range inter-layer and intra-layer Coulomb repulsions, we reduce the afore-mentioned equations to a first-order system via a "first integral". The reduced system is of the BPS type (named after the seminal works of Bogomol'ny [\cite=Bogo] and Prasad-Sommerfield [\cite=Prasad]). We give an energy lower bound in terms of the total flux and show that all finite-energy solutions over the full plane are topological in our context. The BPS system is then transformed into a coupled non-linear elliptic system or "vortex equations", which is a general form of the Toda-type equations of Ichinose and Sekiguchi [\cite=Ichinose2]. We present three sharp theorems establishing the existence, uniqueness, and exponential decay of the vortex solutions, in addition to, quantization of the magnetic flux.

In section 3, we consider vortex solutions over a doubly periodic domain. Via a variational principle and a direct minimization problem, we use a weak compactness argument to prove the existence of vortices. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions, as well as, the uniqueness of the solutions. By a simple integration, we get quantized magnetic flux formulas. The necessary and sufficient conditions for existence give limits on the vortex numbers in terms of the domain size.

In section 4 and 5, over the full plane, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and exponential decay estimates of all finite-energy solutions. Using a Choleski transformation, we find a variational structure of the elliptic system. Through the weakly lower semi-continuity, Gateaux differentiability, and strict convexity of an energy functional, we prove the existence and uniqueness of vortex solutions. Additionally, we exploit the decay estimates to exhibit quantized magnetic flux formulas.

BPS and Vortex Equations

The Lagrangian describing the FQHE in double-layer 2-dimensional electron systems [\cite=Ichinose2] is composed of two terms, the matter term Lφ and the Chern-Simons term LCS,

[formula]

where

[formula]

There are two bosonized electron fields, which represent electrons in the upper and lower layers, denoted by ψσ (σ = 1,2 or [formula]), respectively. M is the mass of the electrons and p and q are nonzero real numbers. a+μ and a-μ are scalar potential fields corresponding to the [formula] local symmetry. μ, ν, and λ take on the values 0,1,2 and εμνλ is the antisymmetric metric tensor. Denote εjk  =  ε0jk. The gauge-covariant derivatives are defined as

[formula]

where the external magnetic field, B, is directed along the z-axis and in the symmetric Coulomb gauge [formula]. We denote the temporal derivatives by

[formula]

The term [formula] represents the interaction between electrons like the Coulomb repulsion and short-range four-body interaction. [formula] is given by

[formula]

and more specifically represents the potential between bosonized electrons. [formula] is the long-range inter-layer and intra-layer Coulomb repulsions. The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations of the Lagrangian density [\eqref=Lagrangian] are where Fμν  =  ∂μa+ν  -  ∂νa+μ and μν  =  ∂μa-ν  -  ∂νa-μ. We recognize equations [\eqref=gaugeSchro1] and [\eqref=gaugeSchro2] as a coupled gauged Schrödinger equations governing the bosonized electron fields in the upper and lower layers, respectively. Equations [\eqref=CSconstraint1] and [\eqref=CSconstraint2] are the Chern-Simons constraints. As a result of not treating the electromagnetic potentials a+ = (a+μ) and a- = (a-μ) as background fields, we get the constraint equations [\eqref=constraint1]-[\eqref=constraint4].

In this paper, we will assume that the long-range inter-layer and intra-layer Coulomb repulsions are negligible and focus on the static case of the Euler-Lagrange equations. With these assumptions, and letting Bμν  =  ∂μbν  -  ∂νbμ - eB and μν  =  ∂μν  -  ∂νμ - eB represent the rate of change of the magnetic fields, where bμ = a+μ + a-μ and μ = a+μ - a-μ, the system [\eqref=gaugeSchro1]-[\eqref=constraint4] is equivalent to Above, we use the summation convention on the indexes j and σ and define [formula], [formula]. The system [\eqref=StaticCSconstraint1]-[\eqref=staticConstraint3] is similar to the non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory due to Jackiw and Pi [\cite=Jackiw] and discussed by Yang [\cite=Yang4]. Recall that for any complex-valued functions ψ and η, we have the identity

[formula]

Using this identity we get

[formula]

and a similar equation for ∂j0. Introduce the operators [formula] as follows,

[formula]

Using [\eqref=operators] in [\eqref=StaticSchro1] and [\eqref=StaticSchro2] we get As a consequence of identities [\eqref=identity1] to [\eqref=identity2], we obtain a "first integral" of the system [\eqref=StaticCSconstraint1]-[\eqref=staticConstraint3] of the BPS type, Consider the total energy [\cite=Ichinose2],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the field configurations for the ground state of the fractional quantum Hall effect and [formula] is the average electron density. Additionally, the ground state for the fractional quantum Hall effect requires the filling factor ν to satisfy

[formula]

As in [\cite=Ichinose2] and using equations [\eqref=magnetic1] and [\eqref=magnetic2], we define the total Chern-Simons flux by

[formula]

Hence, we may write the following energy lower bound

[formula]

and note that solutions to the "self-dual" equations [\eqref=selfdual1] and [\eqref=selfdual2] correspond to lowest energy configurations.

We are interested in finite-energy solutions of the system [\eqref=selfdual1]-[\eqref=field2]. Using [\eqref=selfdual1] and [\eqref=selfdual2], the finite-energy condition reduces to

[formula]

In particular, over the full plane [formula] and to guarantee that the amplitude of the electron fields are equal to that of the ground state, we see that the finite-energy condition imposes the boundary condition:

[formula]

Solutions satisfying [\eqref=topBC] are called topological. Therefore, in our context, all finite-energy solutions over the full plane are topological.

To arrive at the coupled non-linear elliptic system of interest (i.e, "vortex equations") we first introduce the complexified variables ∂  =  ∂1 + i∂2, β = b1 + ib2, and A = A1 + iA2. Away from the zeros of the field [formula], from the self-dual equation [\eqref=selfdual1], we obtain the system Summing [\eqref=eq1] and [\eqref=eq2], and using [formula], we get

[formula]

Let us note that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

In a similar manner, we may use the self-dual equation [\eqref=selfdual2] to obtain

[formula]

Let us denote the set of zeros of the fields [formula] and [formula] by [formula] and [formula], respectively. Note that the zeros of the fields [formula] and [formula] are discrete and of integer multiplicities. Define the functions u1 and u2 by

[formula]

Then, using the transformation [formula], we arrive at the vortex equations, defined for all [formula], where K = (kij) is the matrix

[formula]

and δP(x) is the Dirac distribution concentrated at the point P. The positive integers N1 and N2 are called the vortex numbers. In this paper, we are only interested in the coupled system, for which p not equal to q.

We now state our main existence, uniqueness, asymptotic behaviour, and quantized magnetic flux theorems. In what follows, the notation |Ω| and |K|, denotes the size of the domain and the determinant of the matrix K, respectively.

Consider the coupled non-linear elliptic system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2], over a doubly periodic domain Ω. Let the matrix K, given by [\eqref=matrixK], be positive definite. Then a unique solution exists if and only if the condition

[formula]

is satisfied.

Consider the coupled non-linear elliptic system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2] over the full plane [formula] and satisfying the boundary condition

[formula]

Let the matrix K, given by [\eqref=matrixK], be positive definite. There exists a unique solution to the system, satisfying the boundary condition exponentially fast. More precisely, we have the following exponential decay estimate,

[formula]

when |x| is sufficiently large, ε∈(0,1) is arbitrary, Cε > 0 is a constant depending on ε, and [formula]. Additionally,

[formula]

when |x| is sufficiently large, δ∈(0,1) is arbitrary, and Cδ > 0 is a constant depending on δ.

In both the doubly periodic and the full plane cases, considered in Theorem [\ref=doublyPeriodic] and Theorem [\ref=fullPlane], there hold the quantized magnetic flux integrals

[formula]

where the integration is evaluated either over the doubly periodic domain Ω or the full plane [formula].

Solution Over A Doubly Periodic Domain

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=doublyPeriodic]. We first establish necessary conditions for the existence of a solution and derive the quantized magnetic flux integrals of Theorem [\ref=quantizedInt], over a doubly periodic domain. Through a Choleski transformation, as in [\cite=Yang1] [\cite=Yang4], we find a variational principle. We establish a coercivity condition and via a direct minimization approach, prove the existence of a solution to the system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2] over a doubly periodic domain.

By a doubly periodic domain, Ω, we mean a periodic lattice cell with a "gauge-periodic" boundary [\cite=Yang4]. In other words, our solutions are periodic over a cell domain modulo gauge transformations as introduced by 't Hooft [\cite=Hooft]. In this concrete situation, we can identify Ω with the 2-torus [formula].

There are functions [formula] and [formula], whose existence and uniqueness (up to an additive constant) are guaranteed by Aubin in [\cite=Aubin], satisfying

[formula]

Let [formula] be functions satisfying the system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2]. Define v1 = u1 - u'0 and v2 = u2 - u''0 on Ω. Then, Integrating [\eqref=ellpv1]-[\eqref=ellpv2], we obtain the following linear system of equations in the unknowns [formula] and [formula], Solving for [formula] and [formula] we obtain the necessary conditions In terms of the size of the domain, inequalities [\eqref=ineq1] and [\eqref=ineq2] give

[formula]

and the necessity condition of Theorem [\ref=doublyPeriodic] is established. Note that the vortex numbers N1 and N2 are constrained by the size of the domain.

Integrating equations [\eqref=ellpv1] and [\eqref=ellpv2] over Ω, and expressing the results in terms of |ψσ|2, we get Therefore, from [\eqref=magnetic1], [\eqref=magnetic2], and [\eqref=fillingfactor] we arrive at the quantized magnetic flux formulas of Theorem [\ref=quantizedInt],

[formula]

In its current form, the system [\eqref=ellpv1]-[\eqref=ellpv2] does not have a simple variational structure. However, when the matrix K is positive definite, a variational principle for the elliptic system can be found via a Choleski decomposition, i.e., there is a unique lower triangular matrix L such that K = LLt. To this end, consider the Choleski transformation

[formula]

The system [\eqref=ellpv1]-[\eqref=ellpv2] becomes where

[formula]

The corresponding functional [formula] is

[formula]

Let us show that the above functional I satisfies a coercive lower bound. We use the notation [formula], [formula], and ||  ·  ||1,2 to denote the norm of H12.

Decompose H1 as the direct sum of [formula] and the set H̃1, i.e. [formula]. The set H̃1 is defined as the collection of all w̃∈H1 such that [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and w̃1,w̃2∈H̃1(Ω). From the necessary conditions [\eqref=ineq1] and [\eqref=ineq2], we get Applying the above decomposition to the functional [\eqref=functional],

[formula]

Note that k11 > 0, since |K| > 0. By Jensen's inequality we obtain and the coercive lower bound

[formula]

is attained, where β is a positive constant independent of w1 and w2.

From the coercive lower bound [\eqref=coercive1], we conclude that the functional I is bounded from below. So it makes sense to consider the direct minimization problem:

[formula]

Let {(wk1,wk2)} be a minimizing sequence of [\eqref=minimization], i.e., choose functions wk1 and wk2 in H1, where [formula] so that From [\eqref=coercive1] and the decomposition [formula] where i = 1,2, we may write and conclude that [formula] all belong in L2(Ω).

Recall the Poincaré inequality where C > 0 is a suitable constant. By Poincaré's inequality we obtain

[formula]

for some suitable positive constants αi's, i = 1,2, and conclude that the sequence {w̃ki} all belong in L2(Ω). Therefore, {(w̃k1,w̃k2)} is bounded in H12. Moreover, w̃(  ∞  )1 and w̃(  ∞  )2 belong in H̃1, since

[formula]

After all, we are in a reflexive space and without loss of generality, we may suppose that

[formula]

Let us show that the sequences [formula] and [formula] of real numbers are also bounded. We will need the Trudinger-Moser inequality [\cite=Aubin] of the form

[formula]

where C1 and C2 are positive constants.

From [\eqref=eq3], we may write

[formula]

Taking absolute value on both sides of [\eqref=eq4] and enlarging we have

[formula]

Apply [\eqref=Trud] to the last term in [\eqref=eq5] to obtain

[formula]

Since the sequence {w̃k1} is bounded in H1, we conclude that the sequence [formula] is bounded in [formula]. In a similar way, we may conclude that [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Without loss of generality, we may assume that

[formula]

Define [formula] for i = 1,2. Therefore, from [\eqref=weakconv1] and [\eqref=eq6] we get that

[formula]

To conclude that (w(  ∞  )1,w(  ∞  )2) is the sought out solution of the minimization problem [\eqref=minimization], and hence a solution to the system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2], we appeal to the weak lower semi-continuity of I. The uniqueness of the solution follows directly from the strict convexity of the functional I, which can be shown by a direct calculation of the corresponding Hessian matrix. Therefore, Theorem [\ref=doublyPeriodic] is proved.

Solution Over Full Plane [formula]

In this section, via a variational principle, we prove the existence and uniqueness components of Theorem [\ref=fullPlane]. Our approach follows the ideas by Jaffe and Taubes in [\cite=Taubes] and Yang in [\cite=Yang4]. In contrast to the doubly periodic case, the vortex numbers are not constrained by the domain size.

In order to establish a variational principle, we transform the system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2], satisfying the boundary conditions [\eqref=topobound], to an equivalent system, which can then be view as the Euler-Lagrange equations of a respective functional.

Consider the background functions [formula], depending on a real parameter μ > 0, defined by

[formula]

Note that u'0(x),u''0(x)  ≤  0 for all [formula] and

[formula]

Let We note that u'0, u''0, g'0, and g''0 all belong to [formula]. Define v1 = u1 - u0' and v2 = u2 - u0'' on [formula]. Hence, the system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2] becomes where v1(x)  →    -   ln (2) and v2(x)  →    -   ln (2) as |x|  →    ∞  .

When K is positive definite, we again use the transformation [\eqref=Choleski]. Thus, the system [\eqref=v1]-[\eqref=v2] is transformed to where

[formula]

However, the functions h1 and h2 are not in [formula] and this is an undesired property for what follows. To correct this issue, we define ṽ1 = v1  +   ln (2) and ṽ2 = v2  +   ln (2). Using this new definition, the system [\eqref=v1]-[\eqref=v2] becomes where ṽ1(x)  →  0 and ṽ2(x)  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞  . With the use of [\eqref=Choleski], the system [\eqref=eq7]-[\eqref=eq8] is equivalent to where

[formula]

Moreover, [formula], w1(x)  →  0, and w2(x)  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞  .

The system [\eqref=w1]-[\eqref=w2] is well-defined and is the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional [formula], given by

[formula]

To prove the existence of a solution of the system [\eqref=w1]-[\eqref=w2], it is sufficient to show that the functional I, defined by [\eqref=functional2], attains a unique interior critical point in some open ball in H12. It is straightforward to show that the functional I is strictly convex, Gateaux differentiable, and hence weakly lower semi-continuous. To prove the existence of an interior critical point, we just need to show that the Gateaux derivative of I satisfies a coercive lower bound. We begin by rewriting the functional I in the form

[formula]

where (  ·  ,  ·  )2 denotes the inner product over [formula]. Calculating the Gateaux derivative of I, denoted by dI = dI(w;w), we get

[formula]

For the undetermined parameter μ > 0 sufficiently large, there exists positive constants C1, C2, and C3 such that

[formula]

Proof. We note that the inner product terms of dI are of the general form,

[formula]

for some positive constant α. Define

[formula]

and let v = v+ - v- where v+  =   max {0,v} and v-  =   max {0, - v}. So M(v) = M(v+) + M( - v-).

From the elementary inequalities, ex  ≥  x + 1 and [formula] for all [formula], we get

[formula]

where β is a positive constant, since u0 and g belong in [formula]. For any x  ≥  0 we note that [formula], therefore,

[formula]

Let us now consider the equation

[formula]

From the elementary inequality [formula] for any x  ≥  0, it follows that For μ > 0 large enough, we may obtain [formula]. In addition, since 1 - eu0 and g are in [formula], we have From the absolute value we can conclude that for some positive constant [formula], since 1 - g - eu0 belongs in [formula]. Thus, we have

[formula]

Consequently, [\eqref=eq9] and [\eqref=eq10] gives us

[formula]

for some positive constants C1 and C2. Applying [\eqref=eq15] to each inner product term of dI gives us the desired inequality [\eqref=eq12].[formula]

Absorbing constants into C1 and C2, we may rewrite [\eqref=eq12] in the cleaner form

[formula]

We reuse the positive constants [formula] and keep in mind that the importance of these constants is that they remain positive, of finite value, and independent of w1 and w2.

Define the transformation T(w1,w2) = (u1,u2) such that

[formula]

Applying this transformation to [\eqref=eq16], we get Since T is an invertible transformation, there is a positive constant C0 such that Thus, we have the lower bound which can be rewritten as Using the following standard interpolation inequality over [formula]: we may write Recall the generalized arithmetic and geometric inequality, [formula], where the ai's and λi's are non-negative real numbers such that [formula]. As a special case, we get

[formula]

It follows that,

[formula]

for some positive constant C. By [\eqref=eq18], we obtain

[formula]

Using the relationship between ui and wi, we get the coercive lower bound

[formula]

where C0 and C1 are positive constants independent of [formula]. From [\eqref=eq20], we conclude that, for any δ > 0 there is an 0 < R <   ∞   so that

[formula]

which gives the existence of an interior critical point of I in some open ball in H12. Therefore, the existence part of Theorem [\ref=fullPlane] is established. The uniqueness follows from the strict convexity of I.

Asymptotic Analysis and Quantized Magnetic Flux

In this section, we prove the exponential decay estimates of Theorem [\ref=fullPlane]. We also establish the quantized magnetic flux integral formulas of Theorem [\ref=quantizedInt], over the full plane. Our analysis follows similar ideas as in [\cite=Taubes] [\cite=Yang1] [\cite=Yang4].

Let w = (w1,w2) in H12 be the solution of the variational equations [\eqref=w1]-[\eqref=w2]. Then wi(x)  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞  , for i = 1,2. More explicitly, wi satisfies the uniform decay

[formula]

Proof. We will need the following embedding inequality [\cite=Taubes] for p > 2 ,

[formula]

Let us first justify that [formula] for any f in [formula]. By expanding (ef - 1)2 and using the Taylor series for ef we obtain

[formula]

Integrating [\eqref=5.2] over [formula] and using the embedding inequality [\eqref=5.1] we get

[formula]

which is a convergent series. Therefore, ef - 1 is in [formula] for any f in [formula].

Let wi, in [formula], be the solutions to [\eqref=w1]-[\eqref=w2], then they are also in [formula] for p > 2 by [\eqref=5.1]. In particular, the wi are in [formula]. To establish the desire uniform decay, it is sufficient to show that wi belongs to [formula]. To this end, we rewrite the system [\eqref=w1]-[\eqref=w2] in the form

[formula]

and show that the right hand sides of [\eqref=5.4]-[\eqref=5.5] are in [formula].

We note that h1 and h2 are in [formula]. The terms, [formula] and [formula] are in [formula] by [\eqref=5.3]. Moreover, the term [formula] is in [formula], by

[formula]

where [formula] from [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, we can conclude that [formula] is in [formula]. Thus, the uniform decay of w1 and w2 is established. [formula]

Let w = (w1,w2) be as stated in Lemma [\ref=lem1]. Then [formula] and [formula], also satisfy the uniform decay [formula] as |x|  →    ∞  .

Proof. We note that wi belongs in [formula] for all p  ≥  2 and i = 1,2. We simply need to extend wi to belong to [formula] for all p > 2. To achieve this, it is sufficient to show that the Δwi is in [formula] for p > 2. This follows by proving that each term on the right hand side of [\eqref=5.4]-[\eqref=5.5] is in [formula] for p > 2. It is enough to show that [formula] and [formula] are in [formula].

In general, if f is in [formula] for all p  ≥  2, we can conclude that

[formula]

where [formula] since f is in [formula] and [formula] is in [formula]. By [\eqref=5.1], [formula] and [formula] are in [formula] for all p > 2. The term [formula] is in [formula] for 2  ≤  p <   ∞   since

[formula]

where [formula] since [formula] and [formula] for p  ≥  1. Moreover, [formula] is in [formula] since |eu0' - 1|  ≤  1 and w1 is in [formula]. Hence, [formula] is in [formula] for p  ≥  2.

Similarly, we can show that [formula] is in [formula] for p  ≥  2. Therefore, the uniform decay of [formula] and [formula] follows. [formula]

From (w1,w2), defined in Lemma [\ref=lem1], we get (ṽ1,ṽ2) by the transformation [\eqref=Choleski], and hence a solution pair (u1,u2) is obtained as a solution of [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2] on the full plane [formula], satisfying [\eqref=topobound]. To complete Theorem [\ref=fullPlane], we just need to establish the exponential decay estimates [\eqref=2.46] and [\eqref=2.47].

For the pair (u1,u2) stated above, there holds the exponential decay estimate

[formula]

for |x| sufficiently large, ε∈(0,1) arbitrary, Cε > 0 a constant depending on ε, and [formula].

Proof. The eigenvalues of the matrix K are λ1 = 2 and [formula]. Both eigenvalues are greater than zero and since p  ≠  q, we have that λ1  ≠  λ2. Hence, there is an orthogonal 2  ×  2 matrix O that diagonalizes K, i.e., Take [formula]. Outside the disk of radius R0 centered at the origin, [formula], the system [\eqref=elliptic1]-[\eqref=elliptic2] considered over the full plane, becomes

[formula]

Rewrite [\eqref=5.8] in the form,

[formula]

We would like the terms 2eui - 2ui - 1 to converge to 0 as |x|  →    ∞  . Thus we define vi = ui  +   ln (2). It then follows that each vi  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞   in the sense of Lemma [\ref=lem1]. Then [\eqref=5.9] becomes

[formula]

Define the new variables U1 and U2 such that Using the variables U1 and U2, we express [\eqref=5.10] in the form By using the Taylor expansion of ex, we may write where ajk(U1,U2)  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞   (j,k = 1,2). In two dimensions, we recall the inequality The following inequality then follows,

[formula]

where the function a(U1,U2)  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞  . Consequently, for any ε∈(0,1) we can find an R > R0 large enough, so that

[formula]

Introduce the following comparison function,

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

Subtracting [\eqref=5.11] and [\eqref=5.13], for |x| > R, we get

[formula]

We have the freedom to select [formula], which gives us

[formula]

Now we can select C in [\eqref=5.12] large enough so that U21  +  U22  -  ξ  ≤  0 for |x| = R. Let's denote C by Cε to point out its dependence on ε. We would like to extend this inequality so that it holds for all |x|  ≥  R. Since U21  +  U22  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞   and applying the maximum principle, we can conclude that U21  +  U22  -  ξ  ≤  0 for |x|  ≥  R. For any ε∈(0,1) we have the following useful inequality [formula]. Hence, for |x|  ≥  R we get By the orthogonality of O, the equation U21 + U22 = v21 + v22 follows. Therefore, for |x|  ≥  R, we have the desire inequality

u1 and u2, from Lemma [\ref=lem3], also satisfy the inequality where ε, Cε, and λ0 are as defined in Lemma [\ref=lem3].

Proof. Take R as defined in Lemma [\ref=lem3]. Differentiating equations [\eqref=5.10], for |x| > R, we get

[formula]

for i,j = 1,2 and [formula].

Define U = (U1,U2)τ = (∂1v1∂2v2)τ and E(x) = {eu1(x),eu2(x)}, where {a,b} is a 2  ×  2 diagonal matrix with diagonal entries a and b, respectively. Then the system [\eqref=5.16] may be rewritten in the form where I2 is the 2  ×  2 identity matrix. Consequently, we can establish the following inequality for |x| > R,

[formula]

where b(U1,U2)  →  0 as |x|  →    ∞  . Hence, as in Lemma [\ref=lem3], for |x|  ≥  R, we arrived at the inequality where Cε,j are positive constant depending on ε. Therefore, we can take Cε = 2 max {Cε,1,Cε,2} and obtain the desire inequality

As a result of the exponential decay estimates, we get the quantized magnetic flux integrals. A direct calculation shows that the integrals of the functions g0'(x) and g0''(x) over [formula] are independent of the parameter μ. More explicitly, The divergence theorem in two dimensions gives By integrating equations [\eqref=eq7]-[\eqref=eq8] over the full plane, we get

[formula]

Similarly to the doubly periodic case, we obtain the quantized magnetic flux integral formulas of Theorem [\ref=quantizedInt],
