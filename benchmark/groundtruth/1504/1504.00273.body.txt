Introduction

Throughout the article, all the groups under consideration are finite and simple groups are nonabelian. For a natural number n, we denote by π(n) the set of all prime divisors of n and put π(G) = π(|G|). The spectrum ω(G) of a group G is the set of orders of elements in G. The set ω(G) determines the prime graph Γ(G) whose vertex set is π(G), and two vertices p and q are adjacent if and only if pq∈ω(G). For two vertices p and q we will write (p  ~  q)G to indicate that p is adjacent to q in Γ(G). Denote by s(G) the number of connected components of Γ(G) and by πi(G) [formula], the set of vertices of its ith connected component. If 2∈π(G) then we assume that 2∈π1(G). We recall that the set of vertices of connected components of all finite simple groups are obtained in [\cite=k] and [\cite=w].

As usual, the degree  deg(p) of a vertex p∈π(G) in Γ(G) is the number of edges incident on p. We denote the set of all vertices of the prime graph Γ(G) which are joined to all other vertices by Λ(G). If the prime divisors of |G| are [formula], then we define [formula] which is called the degree pattern of G.

Given a group H, denote by hOD(H) the number of isomorphism classes of groups G such that |G| = |H| and D(G) = D(H). Clearly, there are only finitely many isomorphism types of groups of order n, because there are just finitely many ways that an n  ×  n multiplication table can be filled in. Hence [formula] for any group H. In terms of function hOD, groups H are classified as follows:

Any group H satisfying hOD(H) = k is said to be k-fold OD-characterizable. Usually, a 1-fold OD-characterizable group is simply called an OD-characterizable group, and it is called quasi OD-characterizable if it is k-fold OD-characterizable for some k > 1.

This article is a continuation of my investigations of the OD-characterizability of alternating and symmetric groups initiated in [\cite=kogani]. We keep the notation created and the conventions made therein.

In a series of articles (see [\cite=kogani], [\cite=m4], [\cite=m3], [\cite=m0] and [\cite=z2]), it has been shown that many of the alternating and symmetric groups are n-fold OD-characterizable for n∈{1,2,3,8}. These results are summarized in the following proposition.

The following statements hold:

The alternating groups Ap, Ap + 1, Ap + 2 and the symmetric groups Sp and Sp + 1, where p is a prime number, are OD-characterizable.

The alternating group A10 is 2-fold OD-characterizable, while the symmetric group S10 is 8-fold OD-charaterizable.

The alternating groups Ap + 3, where p  ≠  7 is a prime number less than 100, are OD-characterizable.

The symmetric groups Sp + 3, where p  ≠  7 is a prime number less than 100, are OD-characterizable or 3-fold OD-characterizable.

In addition, it was shown in [\cite=kogani] that all alternating groups Am for which [formula], except A10, are OD-characterizable.

All alternating groups Am, where m is a natural number less than 100, except A10, are OD-characterizable.

These observations convinced us to propose the following conjecture in [\cite=kogani]:

On the other hand, in recent years we have not found any simple group S with [formula]. Therefore, we asked in [\cite=kogani] the following question:

Is there a simple group S with [formula]?

Our recent investigations show that Conjecture [\ref=coj-1] does not hold in general. Recently, the authors showed in [\cite=mahmoodifar-sib] that the alternating group A125 satisfying [formula] (see also [\cite=mahmoodifar-arxiv]). Here, we will show that there exist infinite families of alternating groups Am which are k-fold OD-characterizable with [formula]. We notice that Problem [\ref=prob-1] is also answered positively through these examples.

There are infinitely many alternating groups Am which satisfy hOD(Am) > 1. In particular, there is no upper bound for hOD(Am).

It is also worth mentioning that a similar description as Proposition [\ref=p2] is exhibited about OD-characterizability of symmetric groups Sm, where m is a natural number less than 100 (see [\cite=kogani]). Nevertheless, in checking the list of such groups, we found out that it contains a mistake (in fact, Proposition 4.1 in [\cite=kogani] asserts erroneously that the symmetric group S27 is 3-fold OD-charaterizable). Therefore, another result of the present article can be stated as follows:

The symmetric group S27 is 38-fold OD-characterizable.

Now, we give a revised list of symmetric groups in question.

All symmetric groups Sm, where m is a natural number less than 100, except m = 10,27, are OD-characterizable or 3-fold OD-characterizable. Moreover, the symmetric group S10 is 8-fold OD-characterizable, while the symmetric group S27 is 38-fold OD-characterizable.

The following conjecture involving symmetric groups is posed in [\cite=kogani]:

It turns out that a negative answer to this conjecture is provided by symmetric group S27 (see also [\cite=mahmoodifar-sib] [\cite=mahmoodifar-arxiv]). In addition, we will get many other examples of symmetric groups which are k-fold OD-characterizable with k > 3.

There are infinitely many symmetric groups Sm which satisfy hOD(Sm) > 3. In particular, there is no upper bound for hOD(Sm).

We conclude the introduction with some further notation and definitions. Given a natural number m, we denote by lm the largest prime less than or equal to m and we let [formula]. It is clear that lm = m (or equivalently [formula]) if and only if m is a prime number. Note that if m > 2, then lm is always an odd prime, and so [formula] is even iff m is odd. In addition, from the definition, it is easy to see that

[formula]

We shall use the notation ν(m) (resp. νa(n)) to denote the number of types of groups (resp. abelian groups) of order m. Clearly, [formula]. We also denote the set of partitions of m by Par(m). It is known that for any prime p, νa(pm) = |Par(m)|. Finally, we use Am and Sm to denote an alternating and, respectively, a symmetric group of degree m.

Auxiliary results

In this section we give several definitions and auxiliary results to be used later. The first of them is the following definition of subdirect products.

Let [formula]. A subdirect product of the groups [formula] is a subgroup [formula] of the direct product such that the canonical projections G  →  Gi are surjective for all i.

One way of obtaining a subdirect product of two groups is via the fibre product construction. This is illustrated here for two groups. Given some groups G1 and G2 with normal subgroups N1 and N2 such that G1 / N1 and G2 / N2 are isomorphic, we want to construct a group G having a normal subgroup N isomorphic to N1  ×  N2 such that G / N2 is isomorphic to G1 and G / N1 is isomorphic to G2. Notice that we will usually identify N1  ×  1 with N1 and 1  ×  N2 with N2. To carry out the construction, let π1 and π2 be homomorphisms from G1 and G2 onto some group Q. Now let

[formula]

It is easy to check that G constitutes a subgroup of G1  ×  G2, and the projection maps onto the coordinates map G onto G1 and G2, respectively. We call G the fibre product associated with π1 and π2 (Remak [\cite=remak] called it the meromorphic product of G1 and G2 with normal subgroups N1 and N2.). Also, N1  ×  N2 is a normal subgroup of G and the map π on G defined by π((g1,g2)) = π1(g1) maps G onto Q with kernel N1  ×  N2, so G / (N1  ×  N2) is isomorphic to Q. In fact, we have

[formula]

It is a basic observation that every subdirect product of G1 and G2 is a fibre product (or a meromorphic product) of these groups.

Information on the adjacency of vertices in the prime graphs associated with alternating and symmetric groups can be found in [\cite=vas-vdo] [\cite=zav-maz]. Consider the function [formula], defined as follows: S(1)  =  1 and for m > 1 with prime factorization [formula], [formula]. Then one has [\cite=zav-maz]:

The next two Corollaries are the adjacency criteria for two vertices of Γ(An) and Γ(Sn), respectively.

Let [formula]. Then (p  ~  q)An if and only if [formula], while (p  ~  2)An if and only if [formula].

Let p,q∈π(Sn). Then (p  ~  q)Sn if and only if [formula].

The Goldbach conjecture says that every even natural number n greater than 4 can be written as the sum of two odd primes. In what follows, we will need a stronger conjecture: Strong Goldbach Conjecture. Every even natural number n greater than six can be written as the sum of two distinct odd primes. We can now state the connection between the strong Goldbach conjecture and the adjacency of vertices in the prime graph of a symmetric group:

The following statements are equivalent:

the strong Goldbach conjecture is true;

for each even n > 6, [formula].

It follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=adj-SA] (2).

The coincidence criterion for pairwise nonisomorphic symmetric groups (statement (1) of the Lemma [\ref=newlemma]) is obtained modulo strong Goldbach conjecture.

[formula][formula]The idea of proof was borrowed from [\cite=zev] [formula] In the case when [formula], it is a straightforward verification. In fact, the equality of the prime graphs Γ(Sn) and Γ(Sn - 1), for n∈{4,6}, can be obviously verified using Corollary [\ref=c-symmetric]. Assume now that n > 6. We first claim that m = n - 1. If not, then m < n - 1 and hence one of the numbers n and n - 1 is even. Since [formula], it follows from strong Goldbach conjecture that there exist two distinct odd primes p and q with [formula]. Hence p is adjacent to q in Γ(Sn), while p is nonadjacent to q in Γ(Sm), so these graphs are not equal. This contradiction shows m = n - 1 as claimed.

By Theorem [\ref=equiv-sgc], we may assume that n is an odd number. Assume that Γ(Sn)  ≠  Γ(Sn - 1). The sets of vertices are distinct if and only if n is a prime. If n is a composite number, then the sets of vertices are equal, and so the sets of edges should be distinct. Hence there exist primes p,q∈π(Sn) with [formula]. Then obviously p + q = n, but n is odd. The only possible case is {p,q}  =  {2,n - 2}, and so n - 2∈π(Sn) and n - 2 is a prime.

[formula] The conclusion follows immediately from Corollary [\ref=c-symmetric].

We need the following lemma to find some infinite families of alternating and symmetric groups which are not OD-characterizable.

Take n to be an even natural number. Clearly, pn - 4 is always composite in this case, and so we need only consider pn - 2. Let a = p2 and b = 2. We will now show that given any positive integers a, b, we can find an infinite number of values for N such that aN  -  b is composite. If aN - b is always composite, we are done. Otherwise, there exists a positive integer k such that ak - b = q > a is prime. Then for all positive integers m, we have

[formula]

and certainly ak + (q - 1)m  -  b  >  q for all m > 0, so ak + (q - 1)m  -  b must be composite for all positive integers m.

A possible generalization of Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime] is the following statement, which seems intuitive to be true. Let p be an odd prime. Then, there are infinitely many positive integers n such that

[formula]

are composite. Alternatively, this problem can be formulated as follows.

Let p be an odd prime. Do there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that Δ(pn) > p.

The symmetric group S27

The aim of this section is to find the number of non-isomorphic groups with the same order and degree pattern as the symmetric group S27. Indeed, we will show that there are 38 such groups.

Proof of Theorem [formula]. Let G be a group satisfying the following conditions:

|G| = |S27| = 223  ·  313  ·  56  ·  73  ·  112  ·  132  ·  17  ·  19  ·  23 and

D(G) = D(S27) = (8,8,7,7,5,5,4,4,2).

Under these conditions, we conclude immediately that Γ(G) = Γ(S27) (see also [\cite=kogani]). Letting R be the solvable radical of G, we break the proof into a number of separate lemmas.

First, we show that R is a 23'-group. Assume the contrary. Let 23∈π(R) and let x be an element of R of order 23. Put C = CG(x) and N = NG(〈x〉). By the structure of Γ(G), it follows that C is a {2,3,23}-group. Since N / C is embedded in [formula], N is a {2,3,11,23}-group. Using Frattini argument we get G = RN, and so 19∈π(R). Thus R contains a Hall {19,23}-subgroup L of order 19  ·  23. Clearly, L is cyclic, and so (19  ~  23)G, which is a contradiction.

Next, we show that R is a q'-group for q∈{13,17,19}. Let q∈π(R), Rq∈Sylq(R) and N = NG(Rq). Again, by Frattini argument G = RN and since R is a 23'-group we deduce that 23 divides the order of N. Let L be a subgroup of N of order 23. Since L normalizes Rq, LRq is a subgroup of order 23  ·  |Rq|, which is abelian. But then (q  ~  23)G, which is a contradiction.

Finally, R is a {2,3,5,7,11}-group, and since R  ≠  G, it follows that G is nonsolvable. This completes the proof of lemma.

In what follows, we put [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, S is a direct product

[formula]

where the Pi are nonabelian simple groups, and we have

[formula]

We show now that S is a simple group, or equivalently m = 1.

By way of contradiction, let [formula]. In this case 23 does not divide |S|, for otherwise (2  ~  23)G, which is a contradiction. Hence, for every i we have Pi∈S19. Therefore [formula], and so 23 divides the order of Out(S). But

[formula]

where Qi is a direct product of ni isomorphic copies of a simple group Pi such that

[formula]

Therefore, for some j, 23 divides the order of the outer automorphism group of Qj of nj isomorphic simple groups Pj. Since Pj∈S19, it follows that |Out(Pj)| is not divisible by 23 (see [\cite=atlas] [\cite=zav]). Moreover, since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

it follows that [formula], and so 246 must divide the order of G, which is a contradiction. Therefore m = 1 and S = P1.

By Lemma [\ref=almostsg], we have [formula], where S is a nonabelian simple group in S23, and so [formula], (see [\cite=atlas] [\cite=zav]). Now, it follows from Lemma [\ref=solubleradical] and condition (1) that

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Comparing this with the nonabelian simple groups in S23, we obtain [formula] or A27. We refer to [\cite=zav] for the list of nonabelian simple groups in S23. In the sequel, we deal with two cases separately.

[formula]. In this case, we have [formula]. Thus [formula] or [formula]. If [formula], then |R| = 2. Clearly, [formula] and G is a central extension of [formula]. If G splits over R, then [formula], otherwise we have [formula] (non-split extension). Next, we assume [formula]. In this case R = 1 and so [formula]. Finally, in the case when [formula] there are three possibilities for G.

[formula]. In this case, we have [formula], and so [formula] or [formula]. If [formula], then |R| = 54. We claim that the only possibilities for G are G = R  ×  A26, where R is an arbitrary group of order 54, and [formula] where Q is an arbitrary group of order 27. In the first case, since there are exactly 15 groups of order 54, there are 15 possibilities for G. In the second case, since there are just 5 groups of order 27, there are 5 possibilities for G. To prove our claim, we first observe that the automorphism group of R has order smaller than |A26|. Now, let C = CG(R). Then G / C is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut(R), and so |G / C|  <  |A26|. It follows that C is not contained in R, so CR > R and CR is a normal subgroup of G. Since G / R is simple, it follows that CR = G. Let [formula]. Since [formula], we see that C centralizes D, and since [formula], we see that R centralizes D, and thus [formula]. Now C / D is isomorphic to A26 and [formula]. Since the Schur multiplier of A26 has order 2, the only possibilities are that [formula] has order 1 or 2. If [formula], then C' = A26 and C = D  ×  A26, and in this case, A26 is a direct factor of G. In the remaining case, C' = 2  ·  A26, and in this case, since |D| is 2 times some power of 3, it follows that 2  ·  A26 is a direct factor of C and hence of G.

If [formula], then |R| = 27. Actually, we want to find (up to isomorphism) all groups G having a normal subgroup R of order 27 such that G / R is isomorphic to S26. Let M < G have index 2, where M / R is A26. Note that M is unique. Let C be the centralizer of R in M. Then RC is normal in M, and since M / R is simple, there are only two possibilities: RC = R or RC = M. We want to show that RC = M. Suppose RC = R. Now M / C is embedded in Aut(R) and this group faithfully permutes the 26 non-identity elements of R. This action must be transitive or else M / C is embedded in a direct product of the form Sa  ×  Sb where a + b = 26 and both a and b are positive. But [formula] and

[formula]

This proves that the action is transitive, and it follows that R is elementary abelian. Now

[formula]

This is a contradiction, so RC = M.

Let [formula]. Then C / Z is isomorphic to M / R, which is A26. The Schur multiplier of A26 has order 2, and it follows that [formula] is trivial, and thus C' is a normal subgroup of M isomorphic to A26. It follows that M is the direct product of R and C'. Let be write A = C', so A is isomorphic to A26. Note that A is characteristic in M, so A is normal in G. Now [formula] and G / A has order 54, so G is a subdirect product of G1  =  S26 and G2 = G / A. (Note that, every group of order 54 has a normal subgroup of index 2.) Actually, since each of these groups has a unique homomorphism onto the group of order 2, it follows that G can be constructed as follows: let π1 and π2 be the homomorphisms from G1 and G2 onto the group [formula]. Now, we consider the fibre product associated with π1 and π2, that is

[formula]

Clearly, A26  ×  P is a normal subgroup of G and the map π on G defined by

[formula]

maps G onto [formula] with kernel A26  ×  P, so G / (A26  ×  P) is isomorphic to [formula]. This gives 15 groups, including all direct products of S26 with groups of order 27.

This completes the proof of lemma and Theorem [\ref=th12].

Non OD-characterizable alternating groups

We start this section with a result of M. A. Zvezdina [\cite=zev] which is concerning simple groups whose prime graphs coincide with the prime graph of an alternating simple group. More precisely, she proved:

Although the groups in the statement (e) of this lemma have the same prime graph and so the same degree pattern, but they have different orders. In fact, we have

[formula]

Now, if we can choose the number n such that π(n) is contained in the set of vertices of the prime graph Γ(An) which are joined to all other vertices, then the groups An and An - 1  ×  H, where H is an arbitrary group of order n, have the same order and degree pattern. This will enable us to give a positive answer to problem [\ref=prob-1].

Let G be a finite group satisfying |G| = |Am| = m! / 2 and D(G) = D(Am). By [\cite=kogani], the prime graph Γ(G) coincides with Γ(Am). Simply, Γ(G) is a graph with vertex set [formula] in which two distinct vertices r and s are joined by an edge iff [formula] if r and s are odd primes and [formula] if s = 2.

If [formula] and p = lm, then we will deal with the alternating groups Ap, Ap + 1 and Ap + 2, which are OD-charaterizable (see [\cite=m-z-AC]). Therefore, we may consider the alternating groups Am for which [formula].

Referring to the already mentioned fact (Proposition [\ref=p2]) that all alternating groups Am, [formula], are OD-characterizable, we restrict our attention to the alternating groups Am where m > 100. In what follows, we prove the following result, which shows that there is an infinite family {Am} of alternating groups such that [formula].

Let m be an odd number satisfying [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula]. In particular, if [formula] (resp. [formula]), then [formula] (resp. [formula]).

First of all, it follows by Lemma 2.17 in [\cite=kogani] that [formula], this would mean that every vertex in [formula] and so in π(m) is adjacent to all other vertices in π(Am). Furthermore, since m is an odd number with [formula], the prime graphs Γ(Am) and Γ(Am - 1) coincide by Lemma [\ref=alt-n]. Now, if H is an arbitrary group of order m, then the groups Am and Am - 1  ×  H have the same order and degree pattern, and hence

[formula]

In the case when [formula], it is routine to check that [formula], and so

[formula]

Similarly, if [formula], then [formula], and we obtain

[formula]

The proof is complete.

Proof of Theorem [formula]. The result follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime] and Proposition [\ref=prop1]. Note that, the proof of Proposition [formula] shows that there is no upper bound to hOD(Am). [formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop1], we can find many examples of alternating groups Am with [formula]. We point out here some of them.

Some alternating groups Am, [formula], with [formula].

In this case, we obtain the following simple groups amongst Am with [formula] (see Table 1):

[formula]

and for each of these groups, we have (see Table 1):

We shall use Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime] to show that there are infinite families of alternating groups An, with [formula].

An infinite family of alternating groups A3n, with [formula].

The existence of infinite number of values n for which [formula] is immediate from Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime]. Indeed, if we take n to be a natural number such that [formula], then it follows directly that {7,17}  ⊆  π(3n - 2) and similarly {5,19}  ⊆  π(3n - 4), so the numbers 3n - 2 and 3n - 4 are composite. This shows that [formula], for all [formula] (note that, this provides an alternate proof of Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime] for p = 3). Reasoning as in the proof of preceding Proposition [\ref=prop1], we have

[formula]

where Par(n) denotes the set of all partitions of n. In particular, we have [formula].

An infinite family of alternating groups A5n, with [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime] again, there exist infinitely many values of n for which [formula]. Now for every such n, we have [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop1] (see also [\cite=mahmoodifar-arxiv]).

On the symmetric groups Sm with [formula]

In this section we are looking for finite non-isomorphic groups having the same order and degree pattern as a symmetric group. Suppose that G is a finite group satisfying |G| = |Sm| = m! and D(G) = D(Sm), for some natural number m. First of all, we conclude from [\cite=kogani] that the prime graph Γ(G) coincides with Γ(Sm). Actually, Γ(G) is a graph with vertex set [formula] in which two distinct vertices r and s are joined by an edge iff [formula]. In the case when [formula], we deal with the symmetric groups Sp and Sp + 1, which are OD-charaterizable by [\cite=m-z-AC]. We now consider the symmetric groups Sm for which [formula], that is

[formula]

where p = lm. On the other hand, in view of [\cite=kogani] and Theorem [\ref=th12], it follows that all symmetric groups Sm, where [formula], are 3-fold OD-characterizable, and for this reason we now restrict our attention to the the symmetric groups Sm where m > 100. Here, we first prove the following general result:

Let m be an odd number satisfying [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula].

It follows by Lemma 2.17 in [\cite=kogani] that [formula], this would mean that every vertex in [formula] and so in π(m) is adjacent to all other vertices in π(Sm). Moreover, since m is an odd number with [formula], the prime graphs Γ(Sm), Γ(Sm - 1), Γ(Am) and Γ(Am - 1) coincide by Corollary [\ref=c-symmetric] and Lemma [\ref=alt-n] (see also [\cite=kogani]). Now, if H and K are two arbitrary groups of order m and 2m, respectively, then the groups Sm, [formula], [formula], Sm - 1  ×  H, [formula], [formula] and Am - 1  ×  K, have the same order and degree pattern, and hence [formula]. The proof is complete.

Proof of Theorem [formula]. The result follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=newlemmaprime] and Proposition [\ref=prop2]. Note that, the proof of Proposition [formula] shows that there is no upper bound to hOD(Sm). [formula]

Considering Proposition [\ref=prop2], we can now find many examples of symmetric groups Sm satisfying [formula]. We point out here some of them.

Some symmetric groups Sm, [formula], with [formula].

As before in (4.a), we can obtain the following symmetric groups amongst Sm, which are k-fold OD-characterizable with [formula] (see Table 1):

[formula]

The case S125 had already been studied in [\cite=mahmoodifar-sib].

There is an infinite family of symmetric groups Spn, with p∈{3,5}, such that [formula].

Actually, reasoning as before in (4.b) and (4,c), there are an infinite number of values n for which [formula], and the result is now immediate from Proposition [\ref=prop2] (see also [\cite=mahmoodifar-arxiv]).

We conclude this paper with some comments for future works:

Specify the exact value of hOD(An) (resp. hOD(Sn)) for alternating (resp. symmetric)) groups of degree n for n∈{125, 147, 189, 539, 625, 875}.

It seems that it should be possible to prove that the value of hOD(An) (resp. hOD(Sn)) is bounded by some function of n.
