CDM cosmology from matter only

The CDM cosmological model matches a wide range of observations quite accurately. Despite this success, the model relies on the existence of hypothesized dark matter and dark energy, so its physical justification is poor. We therefore consider a physical interpretation of the CDM model with Friedmann equation

[formula]

where a is the scale factor and where Ωmo, [formula] and Ho are present values of matter density (baryonic+dark matter), dark energy density and the Hubble parameter, respectively. The overdot denotes derivative to cosmic time t. The model describes a universe filled with a mixture of two perfect fluids: gravitating pressureless matter ("dust") and dark energy in the form of the cosmological constant Λ. The constant energy density [formula] is commonly associated with energy of the vacuum, causing a repulsive force, which is mathematically correct, but lacks physical ground. The dust term Ωmo / a3 represents mass density and causes deceleration, so is physically associated with the attractive force of gravity between cosmic matter, be it mostly dark. This view on cosmic matter (deceleration by attraction) is supported by the well known Newtonian interpretation of the dust term on the basis of the shell theorem. Though perhaps intuitive (matter attracts other matter), it rests on the dubious assumptions of instantaneous "action at a distance" in an infinite universe. We therefore replace the unphysical "action at a distance" by propagation of gravity at the speed of light in a universe of finite age, and thus introduce a propagating gravitational horizon. Moreover, due to symmetry the gravitational field in the perfectly homogeneous isotropic universe is zero everywhere, so the concept of gravitational attraction is questionable anyway and replaced by curvature of spacetime in GR. Zero field suggests constancy of the kinetic energy of recession. In a Newtonian context this means constant recession velocities, i.e. a coasting universe, as in Melia [\cite=Melia]. But this is clearly in disagreement with the CDM model. In a Machian context however, mass inertia depends on the (evolving) cosmic potential, so at constant kinetic energy one can perceive deceleration in a rising potential as well as acceleration in a declining potential. So the cosmic potential may be the key to understanding recession.

How to actually determine the cosmic potential is a relatively seldom addressed and, at best, partially answered question. Actually, the mere existence of a cosmic potential is sometimes questioned, as GR is believed to be lacking a concept of it. At the same time, the gravitational potential is at the hart of GR. So it doesn't seem right to ignore the potential of the cosmic masses altogether. We derive an expression of the potential as follows. The mass of an infinitesimal thin spherical shell of comoving radius χ is

[formula]

where ρo is, in comoving coordinates, the constant density of matter. Then, the Newtonian cosmic potential follows from the integral

[formula]

where χg denotes the gravitational horizon in the comoving coordinate system and where the scale factor is normalized so that a = ao = 1 at present cosmic time t = to.

Being subject to cosmic expansion, one expects gravitational waves to be redshifted. The question is if this is fully accounted for in ([\ref=eq:PhiN_X]). To tackle this, while avoiding precise assumptions, we introduce an unknown function of the scale factor f(a) to make sure redshift is accounted for. That is, we assume the actual (redshifted) potential in comoving coordinates (the comoving potential) equals

[formula]

Changing coordinates affects the value of the potential too. We will only consider a frame at rest in the Hubble flow, using either comoving coordinates or proper (i.e. physical) coordinates. Switching from comoving to proper coordinates one measures the proper potential

[formula]

where the function h(a) accounts for the coordinate transformation from comoving to proper coordinates. Since both coordinate systems coincide at present time, we have

[formula]

Sciama [\cite=Sciama] derived, by a gravitational analog of Maxwell's theory, a proper value of the cosmic potential equal to

[formula]

Equating φ' = φu and using ([\ref=eq:PhiN_X]) gives

[formula]

so, using ([\ref=eq:h(ao)]), the present distance to the horizon is

[formula]

The obvious connection of proper cosmic potential φu =  - c2 and speed of light implies constancy of the cosmic potential in reference frames in which the speed of light is equal to c, like in the proper frame of a mass m at rest in the Hubble flow. The proper potential energy of m relative to the cosmic masses within the horizon is therefore

[formula]

Thus potential energy V' equals rest energy mc2. Yet, potential energy is explicitly a relational property between cosmic masses, while this is not apparent from the notion of rest energy. The Newtonian gravitational potential is genuinely Machian by its relational, frame independent nature. Newtonian kinetic energy, on the other hand, is non-relational and frame dependent, so clearly not Machian. There is however no established definition of Machian kinetic energy. Therefore, before considering Machian kinetic energy of the expanding universe, I will briefly introduce Machian physics according to the approach taken by Schr�dinger [\cite=Schroedinger] in his Machian derivation of the anomalous perihelion precession. We assume a frame independent definition of the Machian kinetic energy of the pair of point masses mi and mj,

[formula]

where rij denotes their proper radial distance (separation). Crucial here is that from a relational point of view only radial motion is meaningful in the physical relationship of the two point particles. This ontological notion is due to Bishop Berkeley [\cite=Berkeley], who first pointed out that any motion between two point particles, other than radial motion, in otherwise empty space is unobservable, therefore physically meaningless, or inexistent for that matter [\cite=Telkamp_(2014)]. Like kinetic energy Tij, Machian inertia μij is a relational and mutual property between the two point particles and is defined in proper coordinates as

[formula]

where Vij is the potential energy between the particles, φj(ri) denotes the Newtonian potential due to mj at the position of mi and where the proper total (cosmic) background potential [formula] appears as a scaling constant in the denominator. The reason that only half the value of the proper cosmic potential φu appears is that only the radial component of motion counts and so effectively only half of the cosmic mass contributes to the inertia μmu of a mass m relative to the masses of the universe. The total energy of a point particle m relative to an ensemble u = {m1,..,mN} of other point particles is straightforwardly the sum over all pairs

[formula]

These Machian definitions enable correct prediction of the anomalous perihelion precession and frame dragging [\cite=Schroedinger] [\cite=Telkamp_(2012)]. Using the elementary definitions ([\ref=eq:Tij-1-1]),([\ref=eq:muij-1-1]) we can now formulate the kinetic energy of a mass m relative to the receding masses within the propagating gravitational horizon χg. The situation is a little different here, since we do not regard peculiar motion against (the effective value of) a given background potential ([formula]), but instead consider recessional energy of the background itself. Analogous to ([\ref=eq:Tij-1-1]),([\ref=eq:muij-1-1]) and using ([\ref=eq:comoving_potential]) the kinetic energy (in comoving coordinates) of m relative to the receding spherical cosmic mass shell dM(χ) of radius χ is

[formula]

where [formula] is the speed of recession of the shell, and where dφ = dφN(χ,a) / f(a) and

[formula]

is the part of φN due to mass shell dM. The total kinetic energy of m, in comoving coordinates, relative to the total cosmic mass inside the gravitational horizon is therefore (for simplicity we assume m is a unit mass and drop it from here on)

[formula]

Including comoving potential energy ([\ref=eq:comoving_potential]) total energy of m relative to the cosmic masses in comoving coordinates is

[formula]

where we assume total energy E is a conserved quantity. The suggestion is of course that the energy equation ([\ref=eq:Emu]) is in fact the Friedmann equation, specifically the equation of the CDM model ([\ref=eq:Fr_LCDM]). So we must identify χg(a) and f(a).

χg is a horizon and since we assumed only a single component, i.e. matter, χg must follow either the particle horizon or the event horizon. In a Newtonian context pressureless matter has deceleration [formula], so one expects χg to follow the particle horizon. However, as pointed out already, in a Machian context we expect receding particles to ultimately accelerate while being subject to conservation of energy, which suggests that in that case χg follows the event horizon. And actually, this suggestion follows from considering a coordinate transformation of the energy equation ([\ref=eq:Emu]) from comoving coordinates (χ,t) to proper coordinates (r,τ). Proper potential energy V' =  - c2 is constant. Therefore kinetic energy in the proper frame must be constant too (recall this agrees with the zero field of the isotropic homogeneous universe). We further assume that with a change of coordinates the time parameter changes from the cosmic time t to a certain proper time τ, thus proper kinetic energy is

[formula]

where Rg is proper distance to the gravitational horizon and [formula]. The transformed energy equation in proper coordinates then reads

[formula]

Note that conserved energy E  ( = Eo) must be equal in both coordinate systems because they coincide at present time. Since the proper potential is constant, Machian inertia in the proper frame is constant too (thus saving the equivalence principle). And so we retrieve Newtonian physics in the proper frame. Given constancy of kinetic energy this means recession velocities are constant in the proper frame, i.e. [formula], or dτ = da / Ho. Within the above framework, we thus identified the scale factor as proper time parameter instead of cosmic time t. This suggests that the metric coefficient is not constant (gtt = 1) but varies with the scale factor, gtt = gtt(a), like the spatial coefficients do. That is, the rate of a physical clock changes over time due to gravitational time dilation, even though this is unobservable locally. With both T' and [formula] constant, it follows from ([\ref=eq:Tprop]) that Rg is constant too. This points at a de Sitter universe, i.e. q =  - 1, where the proper distance to the event horizon is constant [\cite=Harrison_(1981)] [\cite=Harrison_(1991)]. Hence, if the gravitational horizon follows the event horizon, then

[formula]

Substituting this into ([\ref=eq:Emu]) and rearranging, we obtain

[formula]

which has exactly the form of the Friedmann equation of the CDM model ([\ref=eq:Fr_LCDM]) provided f(a) is just a constant, i.e. f(a) = fo. Substituting fo and χgo ([\ref=eq:Xgo]), the energy equation in comoving coordinates finally reads

[formula]

Of course we require ([\ref=eq:Energy_comoving]) to be consistent with the general Friedmann equation

[formula]

which for ([\ref=eq:Energy_comoving]) implies that

[formula]

Since ρ  =  ρo / a3 represents matter density, it follows that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Introducing ρco = 3c2H2o / 8πG, the present value of the critical density, the energy equation ([\ref=eq:Energy_comoving]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Thus the energy equation in comoving coordinates ([\ref=eq:Energy_comoving]) is indeed identical to the Friedmann equation of the CDM model ([\ref=eq:Fr_LCDM]). This suggests that our universe is a de Sitter universe, which appears as a CDM universe in the comoving frame. Thus the cosmological constant may indeed have a material origin.
