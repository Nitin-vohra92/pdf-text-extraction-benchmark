On Vaughan Pratt's crossword problem

Definitions and conventions

We begin by defining the type of structures we will be considering. These are called "[formula] comonoids" by Vaughan Pratt; we shall call them Pratt comonoids. The category-theoretic background of Pratt's terminology is not a prerequisite for reading this note; we sketch that background in an appendix, §[\ref=S.chu].

By a Pratt comonoid we shall mean a pair (A,W), where A is a set, and W a set of subsets of A such that

(i) [formula] and A are members of W, and

(ii) whenever C is a subset of A  ×  A such that for every a∈A, both {b|(a,b)∈C} and {b|(b,a)∈C} are members of W, we also have {b|(b,b)∈C}∈W.

In this situation, we will call A the base-set of the Pratt comonoid (A,W), and W the Pratt comonoid structure on A.

A set W of subsets of a set A will be called  T1  if it satisfies

(iii) for all a,b∈A with a  ≠  b, the set W has an element which contains a but not b.

A Pratt comonoid (A,W) will be called  T1  if W is  T1  as a set of subsets of A. It will be called discrete if W = 2A, the full power set of A.

We shall generally identify subsets of A or A  ×  A with  {0,1} -valued functions on those sets. In particular, we may call subsets of A "words" on A, and a subset C  ⊆  A  ×  A satisfying the hypotheses of (ii) a "crossword" over W, since its rows and columns are words lying in W. We will use the notation [formula] and [formula] for the union and intersection (or from the {0,1} point of view, pointwise sup and pointwise inf) of words x and y, and likewise ≤   and ≥   for inclusion, and <   and >   for strict inclusion between words.

For C  ⊆  A  ×  A and a∈A, we shall follow the matrix-theoretic convention of calling {b|(a,b)∈C} the  a -th row, and {b|(b,a)∈C} the  a -th column (rather than the convention of the cartesian plane, where the first member of an ordered pair is the horizontal and the second the vertical coordinate).

This note was inspired by the following question, which will be answered in the negative in §[\ref=S.answer].

[formula]

Though [\eqref=d.VPq] concerns the  T1  case, many of the general results we prove will concern arbitrary Pratt comonoids, with the  T1  condition only brought in for the coups de grace of our main results. Likewise, since our only known example of a  T1  Pratt comonoid that is not discrete is quite complicated, examples showing the obstructions to one or another approach will in general be non- T1.

We shall use set-theorists' notation for ordinals; in particular, the set of natural numbers (nonnegative integers) will be denoted ω. We shall write relative complements of sets as x - y = {a∈x|a∉y}. When subsets of a given set A are under consideration, we shall often write [formula] for the relative complement A - x of a subset x of A.

The next two sections mainly summarize known material.

Some quick examples and immediate results

The easiest examples of Pratt comonoids other than discrete ones are gotten by taking a preorder [formula] on a set A, and defining W to be the set of all down-sets of A, that is, sets x such that [formula] [\cite=comonoid]. The reader can easily verify that such pairs (A,W) satisfy the definition.

For an example that deviates slightly from this form, let A consist of the set ω of natural numbers together with one additional element ∞  , greater than every natural number; and let

[formula]

In other words, W consists of those down-sets which, if they contain all natural numbers, also contain ∞  . Since by the preceding paragraph, the set of all down-sets of A yields a Pratt comonoid, to show that the W we have just described also determines one, we just have to show that any crossword over W whose diagonal contains all pairs (n,n) (n∈ω) must contain (  ∞  ,  ∞  ). Now moving upward or to the left from the diagonal in such a crossword C (i.e., decreasing one or the other coordinate), we see that every pair (m,n) with m,n∈ω belongs to C. Hence the word in W given by each natural-number-indexed row contains all natural numbers, hence, by definition of W, also contains ∞  . This says the element of W corresponding to the column indexed by ∞   contains all natural numbers, hence, again, contains ∞  ; so (  ∞  ,  ∞  )∈C, as required.

(The above example, essentially [\cite=comonoid], is an instance of the more general result [\cite=comonoid], which says that what is called the Scott topology on a directed-complete partial order yields a Pratt comonoid.)

Here are some easy ways of getting new Pratt comonoids from old.

(i) If (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid, then so is [formula] where [formula] the set of complements in A of members of W. If (A,W) is  T1,  then so is [formula]

(ii) If {(A,Wi)|i∈I} is a (finite or infinite) set of Pratt comonoids with the same base-set A, then [formula] is a Pratt comonoid.

(iii) If f:A  →  A' is a set map and (A,W) a Pratt comonoid, and we let W' = {w  ⊆  A'|f- 1(w)∈W}, then (A',W') is a Pratt comonoid.

(iv) If (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid, and u  ≤  v are elements of W, then the pair (Au,v,Wu,v), where Au,v  =  v - u  ⊆  A, and Wu,v  =  {x - u|x∈W with u  ≤  x  ≤  v}, is also a Pratt comonoid.

We get (i) by interchanging  0 's and  1 's in the conditions defining a Pratt comonoid, and likewise in the  T1  condition.

Statement (ii) holds because the condition for (A,W) to be a Pratt comonoid is a closure condition on W, and for any closure operator, an intersection of closed subsets is closed.

To see (iii), note that given any crossword C' over W', its inverse image under f  ×  f will be a crossword C over W, hence the diagonal thereof lies in W, and that diagonal is the inverse image of the diagonal of C', which therefore lies in W'.

Finally, to see (iv), note that if C  ⊆  Au,v  ×  Au,v is a crossword over Wu,v, then [formula] will be a crossword over W, hence its diagonal belongs to W, which translates to say that the diagonal of C belongs to Wu,v, as required.

Part (i) of the above lemma shows that when we prove a result about Pratt comonoids, we can immediately get a dual statement by applying that result to complements of words. Likewise, (iv) allows us to "relativize" any general result about Pratt comonoids to yield a result about the set of words x∈W such that u  ≤  x  ≤  v for given u  ≤  v in W.

Next, we note two easy ways of getting new words from old within a given Pratt comonoid.

Let (A,W) be a Pratt comonoid. Then W is closed under (pairwise, hence finite) meets and joins. That is, if x,y∈W, then [formula] and [formula] also belong to W.

Given x,y∈W, we find that x  ×  y is a crossword on W (every row gives either the word [formula] or the word y; every column gives either [formula] or x), and its diagonal gives the word [formula] so W is closed under intersections.

That it is also closed under unions follows by dualization, i.e., applying the above result to the comonoid [formula] constructed as in Lemma [\ref=L.new_fr_old](i). Alternatively, one can verify directly that [formula] is a crossword on W having [formula] as diagonal.

Some observations on the above results:

Though we have seen that any intersection of Pratt comonoid structures on a set A is again a Pratt comonoid structure, the same is not true of unions, even pairwise unions. For instance, if A = {0,1,2}, and we let W≤ be the set of all down-subsets of A, and W≥ the set of up-subsets of A, then each of these is a Pratt comonoid structure, but their union is not, since it contains both {0,1} and {1,2}, but not [formula]

Of course, since the condition of being a Pratt comonoid structure on A is a closure condition, there is a least such structure containing the union of two given structures. But the resulting closure operation can expand the given union enormously. For instance, suppose we let [formula] the set of integers, again let W≤ and W≥ be the systems of down-subsets and up-subsets of A, and let W be the least Pratt comonoid structure containing [formula] By taking intersections, we see that W contains all singletons {i} [formula] Hence for any subset [formula] the set [formula] is a crossword over W, since every row or column is either empty or a singleton. So W consists of all subsets [formula] Thus, closing under taking diagonals of crosswords has carried the countable set [formula] to a set of continuum cardinality.

We saw in Lemma [\ref=L.vee_wedge] that each Pratt comonoid structure on a set A is closed under pairwise unions and intersections. However, such structures need not be closed under infinite unions and intersections, as may be seen from the example [\eqref=d.*w&infty] above, where W contains all the finite down-subsets of ω, but not their union, ω itself.

Though we do not in general get all infinite unions and intersections, everything we do get can be expressed in terms of such operations:

Let A be any set, and C:A  ×  A  →  2 any map. Then the subset z  ⊆  A corresponding to the diagonal of C can be written as a (possibly infinite) union of (possibly infinite) intersections of subsets of A corresponding to rows and columns of C.

For each a∈A that occurs as a member of at least one row or column of C, let xa  ⊆  A be the intersection of all the rows and columns of C that contain a. Clearly, a∈xa. We claim that, in fact, [formula] This will clearly imply the desired conclusion.

Indeed, for every a∈z, the element a lies in the above union, namely, in the joinand indexed by a. Conversely, if b is in that union, this says it lies in xa for some a∈z. Looking at the  a -th row of C we conclude from the definition of xa that since C(a,a) = 1, we have C(a,b) = 1; and looking at the  b -th column, C(a,b) = 1 similarly implies C(b,b) = 1. So b∈z as required.

The following easily verified observation (which does not refer to diagonal words) will also be useful.

If A and A' are sets, and C a subset of A  ×  A' which has precisely κ distinct rows (resp. columns) then it has at most 2κ distinct columns (resp. rows).

In particular, if C has only finitely many distinct rows (columns), it has only finitely many distinct columns (rows).

The case where is countable

We sketch below the proof of the known result that every  T1  Pratt comonoid (A,W) with countable base-set A is discrete. First, a general observation.

If (A,W) is a  T1  Pratt comonoid and A0 a finite subset of A, then for any subset y of A0 there exists an x∈W with [formula]

For all a,b∈A0 with a  ≠  b, the  T1  condition allows us to choose an xa,b∈W containing a but not b. By Lemma [\ref=L.vee_wedge], the set [formula] is a member of W containing a but no other member of A0. We see that [formula] has the desired property.

We can now get:

If (A,W) is a  T1  Pratt comonoid, and A is countable, then (A,W) is discrete.

Assume without loss of generality that A = ω. Take any z  ⊆  A, and assume inductively that for some n we have found [formula] which are possible candidates for the first n rows and n columns of a crossword having z as diagonal; i.e., such that the partial crossword formed by using the  xm 's as its first n rows and the partial crossword formed by using the  ym 's as its first n columns agree on their n  ×  n intersection, and the diagonal of that intersection yields the first n entries of z.

Now using the preceding lemma, with [formula] we can find xn,yn∈W which extend our partial crossword; i.e., such that the first n entries of xn are the entries of [formula] in the position indexed by n, while its next entry is the entry of z needed in the corresponding position on the diagonal; and such that yn has the symmetric property. This construction, continued recursively, leads to a full crossword over W with z as diagonal.

Now, on to new results.

The complement-closed case

We shall prove in this section that if (A,W) is a  T1  Pratt comonoid, and W is closed under complements, then (A,W) is discrete. We begin with some observations on not necessarily  T1  Pratt comonoids.

Though we have seen that for (A,W) a Pratt comonoid, W need not be closed under infinite unions, we claim that it is closed under unions of families of subsets that are pairwise disjoint. Here is a still more general statement.

Suppose (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid, and xi (i∈I) are elements of W such that for each a∈A, only finitely many of the xi contain a. Then [formula]

Let [formula] For each a∈A, the  a -th row (respectively, the  a -th column) of u is the union of finitely many of the xi, namely, those that contain a. Hence, since W is closed under finite unions, u is a crossword over W, hence its diagonal, [formula] indeed lies in W.

If (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid, then W is closed under forming unions of disjoint families (of arbitrary cardinality).

If (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid such that W is closed under complementation, then W is closed under forming arbitrary unions.

Hence by duality, W is also closed under forming arbitrary intersections.

By Lemma [\ref=L.vee_wedge], W is closed under forming unions of finite families. Let κ be an infinite cardinal, assume inductively that W is closed under unions of families indexed by sets of cardinality <  κ, and let xβ (β∈κ) be a  κ -indexed family of members of W.

For each β∈κ, our inductive hypothesis tells us that [formula] hence since W is closed under complementation, the set [formula] belongs to W. The yβ are easily seen to be pairwise disjoint and to have union [formula] (Namely, each [formula] belongs to yβ for β the least ordinal with a∈xβ.) So by Corollary [\ref=C.disjoint], that union belongs to W.

We now get:

If (A,W) is a  T1  Pratt comonoid such that W is closed under forming complements, then (A,W) is discrete (i.e., W is the set of all subsets of A).

Because (A,W) is  T1,  for each a∈A the intersection of all members of W that contain a is {a}, so by the final assertion of Corollary [\ref=C.complemented], W contains every singleton. Since every subset of A is a union of singletons, another application of that corollary shows that W contains every subset of A.

An interesting non- Pratt comonoid structure on

In the first paragraph of §[\ref=S.quick], we noted that easy examples of Pratt comonoids (A,W) in which W was not the set of all subsets of A could be gotten by starting with any partially ordered set A, and letting W be the set of all its down-sets; and in the next paragraph, we noted a case where such an A admitted a slightly smaller comonoid structure W, determined by a sort of "continuity" condition. Below, we construct another example of a sub-comonoid of the Pratt comonoid arising from a partially ordered set, which differs from it much more strikingly: The partially ordered set A we start with will be 2ω, ordered by inclusion; the partially ordered set of all its down-sets can be shown to have cardinality [formula] but our W will be countable. This example will be a key ingredient in our construction, in the next section, of a non-discrete  T1  example.

Actually, we will construct the Pratt comonoid of this section as a sub-comonoid of the comonoid of all up-sets of 2ω, i.e., families of subsets closed under enlargement. The up-sets of any partially ordered set A form a Pratt comonoid structure on A for the same reason that the down-sets do, and since the partially ordered set 2ω is isomorphic to its opposite, the two comonoids are isomorphic (cf. Lemma [\ref=L.new_fr_old](i)). We will use up-sets because it will be conceptually simpler to take for the building blocks of our construction the up-sets en (n∈ω) consisting of all subsets of ω that contain n, rather than the down-sets given by their complements.

Recall that for every set A, the set 2A of all subsets of A, regarded as a direct product of copies of the discrete topological space 2, is a compact Hausdorff space (compact by Tychonoff's Theorem). A subbasis for its open sets is given by the sets {x∈2A|a∈x} for a∈A, and their complements, {x∈2A|a∉x}. We shall call this topology the natural topology on 2A.

In particular, both 2ω and 22ω have such topologies; note that the definition of the topology on the latter set uses only the set-structure of the former, and ignores its topology. (But a relation between the topologies of these two sets will be key to the proof of the final result of this section.)

We start with some observations on a general partially ordered set A. Recall that if [formula] is a partially ordered set and a∈A, then [formula] is called the principal up-set determined by a. Likewise [formula] is called the principal down-set determined by a. (One normally calls these the principal up-set and principal down-set generated by a, but we will use "determined" to avoid confusion with comonoids generated by sets of subsets.)

Let A be a set given with a partial ordering [formula] and let [formula] denote the set of up-sets of A, with the topology induced by the natural topology on 2A. Then the following conditions on an element [formula] are equivalent.

(i) x is an isolated point of the topological space [formula] i.e., x is not in the closure of [formula]

(ii) x is both the union of a finite (possibly empty) family of principal up-sets, and the intersection of a finite (possibly empty) family of complements of principal down-sets.

To prove (ii)[formula](i), note that if x is a union [formula] then it is the smallest (under inclusion) element of [formula] containing all of [formula] Likewise, if it is an intersection [formula] then it is the largest element of [formula] not containing any of [formula] These conditions together make it the unique element of [formula] containing each of the ai and none of the bj. Now the property of containing or not containing a specified element of A defines an open subset of 2A, hence of [formula] Thus, intersecting the m + n open sets arising from the above description, we get an open subset of [formula] having x as its only point; so x is isolated.

Conversely, since the subsets of [formula] defined by the conditions of containing or not containing a given element of A form a subbasis of its open sets, if x is isolated it must be the unique point in a finite intersection of such sets; i.e., the unique up-set that contains all members of a finite family of points [formula] and no members of another finite family [formula] It is easy to see that there is a least up-set containing [formula] (namely, [formula] and a greatest containing none of [formula] (namely, [formula] Given that the families of up-sets defined by these two properties have nonempty intersection, if the least member of one family and the greatest member of the other did not coincide, then the intersection of the two families would not be a singleton. So they do coincide, giving a description of x as in (ii).

(M. Erné has kindly pointed out to us that the above result can be deduced from the general theory of continuous lattices [\cite=GHKLMS1980], [\cite=GHKLMS2003]. Namely, in any lattice which is bicontinuous in the sense of [\cite=GHKLMS2003], the points that are isolated in the bi-Scott topology are those that are both isolated from above and isolated from below in the sense of [\cite=GHKLMS2003]. A subclass of the bicontinuous lattices are the superalgebraic lattices [\cite=abc] [\cite=ME], which are, up to isomorphism, the up-set lattices of partially ordered sets A; and in these, the elements isolated from below are the finitely generated upsets, those isolated from above are the complements of finitely generated down-sets, and the bi-Scott topology agrees with the topology induced by the natural topology on 2A, yielding the statement of the lemma.)

We now apply the above lemma to the case where A is the set 2ω, partially ordered by inclusion. (We could allow any set in place of ω, but we shall see in §[\ref=S.*P_Pi] that this example can be generalized in other ways; so we will just consider here the case we are about to use.) Conditions (i) and (ii) below are as in the lemma; (iii) is what is new.

Let A = 2ω, partially ordered by inclusion, ⊆  , and U⊆(A)  ⊆  2A its set of up-sets. For each natural number n, let en∈U⊆(A) denote the set of all subsets of ω containing n. Then the following conditions on an element x∈U⊆(A) are equivalent.

(i) x is an isolated point of U⊆(A) under the natural topology.

(ii) x is both the union of a finite (possibly empty) family of principal up-sets, and the intersection of a finite (possibly empty) family of complements of principal down-sets of A.

(iii) x lies in the lattice generated by [formula] i.e., the closure of that set under pairwise unions and intersections.

By Lemma [\ref=L.isolated], (i)[formula](ii), so it will suffice to show that (iii)[formula](ii), and that (i)[formula](ii)[formula](iii).

Assume (iii). If [formula] it is both the union of the empty family of principal up-sets and the intersection of a  1 -element family of complements of principal down-sets, namely [formula] so it satisfies (ii). The case x = A is seen similarly.

If x is neither [formula] nor A, it can be written as a lattice-theoretic expression in the en, and using distributivity, we can express it both as a finite join of finite meets of these elements, and as a finite meet of finite joins thereof. Using the former expression, we note that each finite meet [formula] is the principal up-set determined by [formula] so we have the first condition of (ii).

On the other hand, when we express x as a finite meet of finite joins of the en, each of those finite joins can be looked at as the complement of a finite meet of complements of the en; and we see that such a meet [formula] is a principal down-set, the set of elements of A that are [formula] So x is a finite meet of complements of principal down-sets, giving the second condition of (ii).

Conversely, assume (i)[formula](ii). By (ii), x can be written as a finite join of principal up-sets, [formula] [formula] Without loss of generality we may assume that none of the si contains any of the others. Suppose one of them, si, were infinite. Then [formula] is the intersection of the downward-directed set of up-sets [formula] as s ranges over the finite subsets of si, and we see that it will be the limit of those up-sets under the topology on U⊆(A). Now holding the other sj in our expression for x fixed, and letting s  →  si as above, we get a family of up-sets approaching x. Moreover, if one of these up-sets by which we are approaching x coincided with x, say the one constructed from a finite subset s  ⊆  si, then x would have s as a member, which it does not, since none of the other  sj 's is contained in si. Thus x is a limit of points distinct from x, contradicting (i). So all si are finite, hence each [formula] is a finite (possibly empty) meet of the en, so x is a finite (possibly empty) join of such finite meets, proving (iii).

We can now prove:

Let A = 2ω; for each natural number n let en  ⊆  A be the set of subsets of ω containing n, and let W  ⊆  2A be the closure of [formula] under pairwise unions and intersections. Then (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid.

We first note that every x∈W, regarded as a function A  →  2, is continuous with respect to the product topology on A = 2ω and the discrete topology on 2. Indeed, the generators en and their complements are the characteristic functions of the open-closed generating sets for the topology on A, hence are continuous, as are the constant functions [formula] and A; and the general member of W is obtained from the en, [formula] and A using the operations [formula] and [formula] on 2, which are necessarily continuous in the discrete topology on 2.

Thus, if C:A  ×  A  →  2 is any crossword whose rows are given by elements of W, then each row represents a continuous map A  →  2. Hence the whole crossword, thought of as a map taking each element of A to the column it indexes, is a continuous function A  →  2A.

Suppose now that C as above has infinitely many distinct columns. Let B be an infinite subset of A whose members index distinct columns of C. Since A is compact, we can find some limit-point b∈A of B. By continuity, the column of C indexed by b is a limit-point of columns indexed by the elements of B. Hence, since elements of W are isolated points, the  b -th column of C cannot be a member of W.

It follows that if all rows and columns of C belong to W, then C can have only finitely many distinct columns, and thus by Lemma [\ref=L.2^*a], also only finitely many distinct rows. Hence we can apply Lemma [\ref=L.diag_is_veewedge] (with its qualifier " possibly infinite" irrelevant because of the above finiteness results), and the fact that W is closed under pairwise unions and intersections, to conclude that the diagonal of C is a member of W; proving that (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid.

We will have further use for the technique of the last sentence of the above proof; so let us record what that argument gives us.

Suppose A is a set and W a set of subsets of A which is closed under pairwise unions and intersections, and contains [formula] and A. Suppose, moreover, that no crossword C:A  ×  A  →  2 with all rows and columns in W has infinitely many distinct rows (equivalently, by Lemma [\ref=L.2^*a], has infinitely many distinct columns). Then (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid.

A non-discrete Pratt comonoid

We are now ready to construct a Pratt comonoid (A,W) that answers the question [\eqref=d.VPq] in the negative.

Intuitively, the idea will be to make our base-set A the union of many "islands", and take W to be generated by an uncountable family of subsets wn,γ of A, such that each generator, when restricted to certain of the islands, looks like one of the generators in the example of Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w] above, while everywhere else, it looks like one of a countable family of generators un of a discrete Pratt comonoid structure on A.

The fact that the wn,γ look "in most places" like the un will make our structure  T1.  On the other hand, the system of "islands" will be set up so that given any countable family of the wn,γ, there is some island on which that family acts precisely like our generating set for the construction of Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w]. We will use this property to show that, as in that theorem, no crossword formed from lattice expressions in our generators can have infinitely many distinct rows or columns; whence those lattice expressions will in fact form a Pratt comonoid structure on A, which we shall see is  T1  but not discrete.

We begin with an easy general observation.

If A is a set of continuum cardinality, then there is a countable  T1  family [formula] of subsets of A.

It suffices to construct such a family for A = 2ω. To do this, let us define each even-indexed set u2n to be the set en of subsets of ω which contain n, and each odd-indexed set u2n + 1 to be the set [formula] of subsets of ω which do not contain n. The  T1  property is immediate.

Recalling that ω1 denotes the first uncountable ordinal, we now define the base-set A of our example:

[formula]

The typical element of A will be written (a',a''), with a'∈A', a''∈A''. The "islands" referred to in the above sketch will be the sets {a'}  ×  A''.

Observe that A has the cardinality of the continuum. Indeed, since A'' has that cardinality, it suffices to show that A' has at most that cardinality. Now A' is contained in the set of all maps ω  →  ω  ×  ω1, and the cardinality of that set is bounded above by the result of replacing ω  ×  ω1 in that description by 2ω, i.e., by the cardinality of the set of maps ω  →  2ω, which is [formula] as required.

Hence by Lemma [\ref=L.ctb_T1], we can

[formula]

We now define the family of subsets of A (which we will express as  {0,1} -valued functions) that we will take as the generators of our Pratt comonoid. Namely, for each (n,γ)∈ω  ×  ω1, we let wn,γ:A  →  2 be defined by

[formula]

Thus, for each "island" {a'}  ×  A'', the coordinate a' specifies a countable sequence of ordered pairs (n,γ) such that the corresponding generators, wn,γ, act on the  A'' -components of members of that island like the generating functions ei of the example of Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w]; namely, if (n,γ) = a'(i), then wn,γ selects the  i -th coordinate of a''.

Now let

[formula]

Most of our work will go into showing that (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid.

Turning back to the definition [\eqref=d.ceg_A] of A, observe that each a'∈A' has countable image; hence the set of second coordinates of elements of that image will be bounded within ω1. Hence defining, for each β  <  ω1,

[formula]

we have

[formula]

and we see from the first line of [\eqref=d.wn*m] that

[formula]

We can now deduce that

[formula]

Namely, given a1, a2∈A, the  T1  property of the un lets us choose an n such that un(a1) = 1, un(a2) = 0, and [\eqref=d.A=bigcup] allows us to choose a β such that a1,  a2∈Aβ; so by [\eqref=d.like_un], wn,β(a1) = un(a1) = 1, wn,β(a2) = un(a2) = 0, as required.

Let us show next that

[formula]

By [\eqref=d.W_frm_wn*m] it suffices to show that the restrictions to Aβ of the generating elements wn,γ are countable in number. By [\eqref=d.like_un], those wn,γ with γ  ≥  β have restrictions given by the countably many elements un. By definition of ω1, there are only countably many γ  <  β, and hence only countably many wn,γ with such γ, completing the proof of [\eqref=d.ctbl_on_A*l].

We need, next, a combinatorial lemma (which we will apply to occurrences of the wn,γ appearing as arguments in a  j -variable lattice term).

Let X be a set, j a positive integer, and S an infinite set of ordered  j -tuples of elements of X, such that in each member of S, the j entries are distinct.

Then there exist an infinite subset S'  ⊆  S and an i < j such that, after we apply some permutation of the j coordinates to all our  j -tuples, all members of S' begin with the same initial  i -element string, while every element of X that occurs in one of the last j - i positions of an element of S' occurs in no other member of S'.

Thus, cutting S' down to a countable set if it was uncountable, and writing k = j - i > 0, we can find distinct elements [formula] [formula] such that S' consists of the  j -tuples

[formula]

Let i < k be the largest integer such that S contains infinitely many elements which agree in some common  i -tuple of their coordinates; let us perform a permutation of indices that makes [formula] such a set of coordinates, and let us choose [formula] which appear in that order as the first i coordinates of infinitely many elements of S. Let S0  ⊆  S be the infinite set of those elements of S beginning with the string [formula] Note that the maximality of i implies that no element of X other than [formula] occurs in infinitely many members of S0.

Now let k = j - i, and choose any [formula] such that [formula] As just noted, each of [formula] appears as an entry in only finitely many members of S0, so if we let S1 be the set of elements of S0 in which none of them appear, this will still be infinite, and we can pick [formula] such that [formula] Letting S2 be the infinite set of elements of S1 involving none of [formula] we can similarly pick [formula] to get an element of S2; and so forth. Thus we get an infinite family S' of the desired form.

(We shall only need a countably infinite S'; but if we wished, we could get S' to have any regular cardinality [formula] by replacing references to finite and infinite subsets of S in the above proof with subsets of cardinalities <  κ and ≥  κ.)

Using this lemma, let us prove:

For A and W defined as in [\eqref=d.ceg_A]-[\eqref=d.W_frm_wn*m], every uncountable subset W0  ⊆  W contains a countable subset W1 such that the set of distinct functions W1  →  2 obtained by evaluation at different elements of A has continuum cardinality.

Each member of W can be written as a lattice expression [formula] of some finite length j, whose arguments [formula] are distinct, and which depends nontrivially on all j of its arguments (i.e., such that inserting all combinations of  0 's and  1 's in those j positions in b, the resulting function depends on each of its variables). Note that, ignoring the choice of variables [formula] there are only countably many distinct finite lattice terms; hence the uncountability of W0 implies that there is some lattice term b, say in j variables, from which one can get infinitely many of the members of W0 by inserting appropriate elements wn,γ as its arguments. Let us fix such a b.

We can now apply Lemma [\ref=L.all_or_1] with X = {wn,γ}, and S the set of  j -tuples of elements of X which, when used as the argument-string of b, give an element of W0. That lemma gives us a sequence of distinct elements [formula] [formula] such that

[formula]

In particular, the set

[formula]

will be a countably infinite subset of W0. Having so chosen the [formula] and [formula] let us encode them as an element a'∈A', setting

[formula]

To complete the proof of the lemma, we shall construct for this a' a continuum-sized family of points of {a'}  ×  2ω such that restriction to distinct points of that family induces distinct  {0,1} -valued functions on the countable set W1.

To do this, recall that our lattice-expression b depends on all j = i + k of its arguments. Combining this with the fact that lattice operations are isotone (order-respecting), we see that for some choice of values [formula] we will have

[formula]

Let us fix such [formula] Within {a'}  ×  2ω, let us now choose the  2ω -tuple consisting of all elements whose  A'' -coordinates have the values [formula] at [formula] then have a common value, 0 or 1, at [formula] likewise a common value, 0 or 1, at [formula] and, generally, for each h∈ω, a common value, 0 or 1, at [formula] We see from [\eqref=d.wn*m] and [\eqref=d.b=0] [\eqref=1] that on the  ω -tuple of elements comprising W1, this family of points of A will induce all 2ω possible  ω -tuples of values in {0,1}, yielding the assertion of the lemma.

Contrasting [\eqref=d.ctbl_on_A*l] and Lemma [\ref=L.unctbl], we get:

Let A and W be defined as in [\eqref=d.ceg_A]-[\eqref=d.W_frm_wn*m], and C be any function A  ×  A  →  {0,1}.

Then if C has uncountably many rows which give distinct values in W, it has at least one column which is not in W. Likewise, if C has uncountably many columns giving distinct values in W, it has at least one row not in W.

If C has rows with uncountably many distinct values in W, let W0  ⊆  W be the set of values of these rows. Choose W1  ⊆  W0 as in Lemma [\ref=L.unctbl], and choose β∈ω1 such that all of the elements of W1 occur as rows indexed by members of Aβ. (This can be done because W1 is countable, while ω1 has uncountable cofinality.) Then by choice of W1 and β, the restrictions of the columns of C to Aβ give continuum many distinct functions Aβ  →  2. But by [\eqref=d.ctbl_on_A*l], only countably many of these restrictions can arise from members of W; so not all columns of C belong to W. The statement with rows and columns interchanged is seen in the same way.

Now assume that C is a crossword over W. The above corollary shows that C can have at most countably many distinct rows and at most countably many distinct columns. Hence the rows and columns of C are expressible as lattice-theoretic expressions in countably many of the wn,γ; let [formula] [formula] be a countably infinite family in terms of which they can be expressed. (If only finitely many are needed, choose the rest arbitrarily.) Let a'∈A' be defined again as in [\eqref=d.a'=], but now using this family of pairs. Then as noted in the paragraph following [\eqref=d.wn*m], the elements [formula] will behave on {a'}  ×  2ω  ⊆  A like the generators [formula] in Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w]. Hence restricting C to a crossword on {a'}  ×  2ω  ⊆  A, and regarding {a'}  ×  2ω as a copy of 2ω, this crossword will, by the proof of that theorem, have only finitely many distinct rows and columns.

Moreover, rows of the whole crossword C that represent distinct elements of W must be described by distinct elements of the free distributive lattice generated by the [formula] hence their restrictions to their entries indexed by elements of {a'}  ×  2ω will also be distinct; so if C has infinitely many distinct rows, it must have infinitely many distinct columns indexed by members of {a'}  ×  2ω; hence the induced crossword on that set will have infinitely many distinct columns, which we have just seen is impossible. So such a C can have only finitely many distinct rows; hence by Corollary [\ref=C.fin_many], (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid.

Since a discrete Pratt comonoid allows all combinations of rows to appear in a crossword, results such as [\eqref=d.ctbl_on_A*l] or Corollary [\ref=C.unctbl_C] show that (A,W) is not discrete. Let us also note that the cardinality of W is the cardinality of a free distributive lattice with [formula] generators, which is [formula] We have thus proved:

For A and W as described by [\eqref=d.ceg_A]-[\eqref=d.W_frm_wn*m], (A,W) is a non-discrete  T1  Pratt comonoid, with [formula] and [formula]

Can a Pratt comonoid structure be countably infinite? First results

We saw in §[\ref=S.countable] that a  T1  Pratt comonoid (A,W) such that A is countable must be discrete. What if we restrict W rather than A? In the example of the preceding section, W was uncountable because of the index-set ω1 occurring in the definition of its generators wn,γ; and we needed this uncountability in proving  T1 -ness, i.e., condition [\eqref=d.wn*mT1]. (We used it again in proving Lemma [\ref=L.unctbl], but we wouldn't have had to prove that lemma if in place of the ω1 in our definitions we had been able to use, say, ω, since then W would have been countable.)

So let us pose:

Does there exist an infinite  T1  Pratt comonoid (A,W) such that W is countable?

If not, does there exist a non-discrete infinite  T1  Pratt comonoid such that W is countably generated (under the closure operator of forming diagonals of crosswords)?

We have not been able to answer either of these questions.

Our first thought was that if we took an uncountable set A and a fairly "random" countable  T1  family of subsets, and closed it under finite unions and intersections, then the "randomness" might prevent the resulting set W from having crosswords with infinitely many distinct rows and columns, so by Corollary [\ref=C.fin_many], W would be a Pratt comonoid structure on A.

But Corollary [\ref=C.disjoint] already warns us that there will be difficulties: W must not have infinite pairwise disjoint families. In trying to find examples, the authors came up with some intricate ways of constructing  T1  lattices of subsets of a set A having no disjoint pairs of nonempty elements. For instance, suppose we let A be an antichain of subsets of ω (a family of elements none of which contains another), which can be taken to be uncountable, and for each natural number n let en be the set of members of A which contain n; and consider the Pratt comonoid structure W on A generated by these en. The condition that A be an antichain guarantees that the family {en} is  T1;  and it is not hard to get examples where the sublattice generated by [formula] is a free distributive lattice with 0 and 1 on the en, and hence has no nontrivial pairs of disjoint elements. Yet when we examined examples of this sort, we found repeatedly that they admitted unexpected crosswords which brought more subsets into W, and ultimately led to discrete structures. We shall now show why something like this was inevitable.

Again, we begin with a result on not-necessarily  T1  structures.

Let (A,W) be a Pratt comonoid, [formula] an  ω -indexed descending chain of elements of W, and [formula] an  ω -indexed ascending chain of elements of W, such that either [formula] or [formula]

Then [formula]

In the case where [formula] note that any a∈A can belong to only finitely many of the xn, hence, a fortiori, can belong to only finitely many of the sets [formula] Hence the conclusion is an immediate consequence of Lemma [\ref=L.near_disjoint].

Under the alternative hypothesis [formula] we get the dual of the preceding result, with the roles of the xi and yi interchanged; but this does not quite give the conclusion we want. Rather, it says that given [formula] and [formula] with [formula] we have [formula] Now since [formula] and the yn form an increasing chain, every a∈A lies in almost all the sets [formula] If in fact a∈y0, it lies in all of them; if not, it lies in all of them if and only if it lies in all xn before the point where it appears in yn. These observations together show that [formula] so our dualized result says that [formula]

If we now apply this result with the sequence yn replaced by the sequence that has [formula] in place of y0, and yn - 1 in place of yn for n > 0, we get the desired conclusion.

The next result is somewhat more complicated to state, so for simplicity we will only formulate the conclusion under one of the two dual hypotheses. But we remark that if both conditions [formula] and [formula] hold, then the final hypothesis says that although the sequence of  x 's gets small, and the sequence of  y 's gets large, no yn contains any xm. The form shown is the modification of that condition needed when [formula] is not necessarily everything.

When we refer to W containing a complete sublattice, we mean a subset closed in 2A under (possibly infinite) unions and intersections, but not necessarily containing [formula] or A.

Again let (A,W) be a Pratt comonoid, [formula] an  ω -indexed descending chain of elements of W, and [formula] an  ω -indexed ascending chain of elements of W, and suppose that [formula] Suppose moreover that for no pair (m,n)∈ω  ×  ω does yn contain [formula]

Then W has at least continuum cardinality; in fact, it contains a complete sublattice isomorphic to the lattice of all subsets of ω.

Let us show, first, that we can construct sequences of integers [formula] and [formula] such that for all i,

[formula]

We take m(0) and n(0) arbitrary. Suppose, recursively, that we have found [formula] and [formula] so that [\eqref=d.mi_ni] holds for all i < j. By the final hypothesis of the proposition, [formula] so there is some a in the latter set that is not in the former; i.e., which lies in xm(j) and some yi but not in yn(j). In particular, we can find n(j  +  1)  >  n(j) such that a∈yn(j + 1); moreover, since [formula] we can find m(j  +  1)  >  m(j) such that a∉xm(j + 1). With a, n(j  +  1), and m(j  +  1) so chosen we see that [\eqref=d.mi_ni] also holds for i = j. Thus we get sequences m(i) and n(i) satisfying [\eqref=d.mi_ni] for all i∈ω.

Now let

[formula]

Since {m(i)} is a cofinal subsequence of ω, we have [formula] hence by Lemma [\ref=L.x_i] [\ref=y_i], z∈W. We claim that if for all i∈ω we define

[formula]

(again an element of W), then

[formula]

but

[formula]

To see [\eqref=d.zi>], apply [\eqref=d.mi_ni] to get an element [formula] that is not in [formula] or [formula] Thus, [formula] The fact that a is in the first of these two difference-sets tells us that for j > i, a∉xm(j), while the fact that it is in the second set tells us that for j  ≤  i, a∉yn(j), so in each case, [formula] Hence a∈zi does not lie in any of the joinands of [\eqref=d.z=], giving [\eqref=d.zi>].

To get [\eqref=d.zizj], note that "≥  " holds by [\eqref=d.zi>], so it suffices to prove "≤  ". Assume without loss of generality that i  <  j. Then

[formula]

Statements [\eqref=d.zi>] and [\eqref=d.zizj] together say that the zi are sets properly containing z, which on removing z give pairwise disjoint sets. By Lemma [\ref=L.new_fr_old](iv), the results of removing z from all elements of W which contain it form a Pratt comonoid on A - z; so the zi yield pairwise disjoint nonempty elements of that Pratt comonoid, hence by Corollary [\ref=C.disjoint], the unions of arbitrary subsets of these sets are members of that Pratt comonoid. The corresponding elements of W give a complete lattice of subsets of the asserted form.

A problem with finding applications of the above proposition is that it is often hard to find natural hypotheses on a Pratt comonoid that lead to a countable descending chain with empty intersection, or, if we have such a chain, that lead to an ascending chain which does not eventually "swallow up" the descending chain. However in the next result we get both of these, using the  T1  assumption together with the condition that (A,W) be generated by the sort of family discussed following Question [\ref=Q.ctbl_W] above.

When we speak of (A,W) being "generated by" a family S of subsets of A, we mean, of course, that W is the least Pratt comonoid structure on A which contains S.

Suppose (A,W) is a  T1  Pratt comonoid which can be generated by a countably infinite family S of subsets of A that satisfy no nontrivial distributive lattice relations (i.e., which form a set of free generators of a free distributive lattice). Then W has at least continuum cardinality, and in fact contains a complete sublattice isomorphic to the lattice of subsets of ω.

If A is countable, Theorem [\ref=T.countable] gives the desired conclusion, so assume A uncountable. Now if we associate to each a∈A the set of members of S which contain it, then to distinct elements of A we will associate distinct subsets of S (because W is  T1,  so S must also be). Hence only countably many elements of A can yield cofinite subsets of S, so let a∈A be an element such that the associated set is non-cofinite in S. Let us now write S as a disjoint union of two infinite sets: a set S1 which properly contains the set of elements of S containing a, but is still non-cofinite; and its complement, S2 = S - S1.

Since S1 properly contains the set of elements of S containing a, it includes some element not containing a, so the intersection of the members of S1 does not contain a. On the other hand, for any b  ≠  a, the  T1  condition tells us that some s∈S which contains a (and hence belongs to S1) does not contain b; so the intersection of the members of S1 is empty.

Let us now index each of S1 and S2 by ω, and for each i∈ω, let xi be the intersection of the first i elements of S1, and yi the union of the first i elements of S2. We claim that for all m and n we have [formula] For if [formula] then in particular, [formula] which is a nontrivial lattice relation among the first m elements of S1 and the first n  +  1 elements of S2, contradicting the assumption on S. So no such relation holds, hence Proposition [\ref=P.continuum] gives the conclusion of the theorem.

Did the above proof use the full strength of our hypothesis that the elements of S satisfy no nontrivial distributive lattice relations? If we write S1 as {s1,i|i∈ω} and S2 as {s2,i|i∈ω}, then we find that the condition used at the end of the proof reduces to the statement [formula] Now the condition that the elements of S satisfy no nontrivial distributive lattice relations is indeed equivalent to saying that for no two disjoint finite families of elements of S does the join of one majorize the meet of the other. (To see this, note that any lattice word in a set of elements of a distributive lattice can be reduced to a join of meets, and also, dually, to a meet of joins. Hence every relation on a family of elements of such a lattice is equivalent to the statement that some meet of joins majorize some join of meets. But a meet majorizes an element if and only if each meetand majorizes it; and a join is majorized by an element if and only if each joinand is majorized by it; so every such relation reduces to a family of relations each of which says that a join of elements of our given set majorizes a meet of elements of that set; hence freeness says that no such nontrivial relation, i.e., no such relations in which no generator appears as both a meetand and a joinand, holds.)

However, looking at the quantifications involved in the proof of the theorem, one finds that one can slightly restrict the set of relations that one needs to assume do not hold.

In the situation of Theorem [\ref=T.continuum], the condition that S generate a free distributive lattice can be weakened to say that there exists a partition of S into finitely many disjoint subsets, [formula] such that no relation [formula] holding in W with every tj distinct from every si has all but at most one of the si belonging to the same set S(i).

Assume S has the above weakened property. In the proof of Theorem [\ref=T.continuum], after choosing S1 to properly contain the set of elements of S containing a, and to have infinite complement, note that this complement must contain infinitely many members of one of our sets, say S(i). So rather than taking S2 to be the full complement of S1 in S, let us take it to consist of the members of that complement which belong to S(i). We can now complete the proof as before. At the last step, if we have a relation [formula] we note that the meetands on the right satisfy [formula] with at most the last meetand s2,n not in S(i), contradicting the hypothesis on S.

We do not know how one might make use of this weaker hypothesis in studying Question [\ref=Q.ctbl_W].

Further results on Pratt comonoids with smaller than the continuum

The arguments in the preceding section used the fact that if (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid such that W has cardinality less than the continuum, then W cannot contain infinitely many pairwise disjoint sets (by Corollary [\ref=C.disjoint]). This fact restricts the structure of such comonoids in other ways as well.

The next lemma seems likely to be known, but since we do not know a reference, we will give the proof. We will be applying it to a lattice, the W of a Pratt comonoid (A,W), but since it only involves the operation [formula] the natural context for stating it is that of a [formula]-semilattice. Recall that this means a set L with a single idempotent commutative associative operation [formula] one then regards L as partially ordered by taking x  ≤  y if [formula]

Let us make:

If L is a [formula]-semilattice with least element 0, we shall call two elements of L disjoint if their meet is 0, and we will call a nonzero element x∈L strongly indecomposable if there do not exist two disjoint nonzero elements < x in L.

We will call two strongly indecomposable elements x,  y∈L equivalent if they are not disjoint.

That the above condition is indeed an equivalence relation on strongly indecomposable elements is immediate from the definitions.

Three examples: In the lattice of open-closed subsets of the Cantor set, regarded as a [formula]-semilattice, there are no strongly indecomposable elements. In the lattice whose elements are all the neighborhoods of a point p of a topological space, together with the empty set, which plays the role of 0, all nonzero elements are strongly indecomposable, and form a single equivalence class. In the lattice of all subsets of a set X, the singletons are the strongly indecomposable elements, and no two distinct singletons are equivalent.

If L is a [formula]-semilattice with least element 0 which has no infinite family of pairwise disjoint nonzero elements, then L has only finitely many equivalence classes of strongly indecomposable elements, and every nonzero element of L majorizes at least one strongly indecomposable element.

There cannot be infinitely many equivalence classes of strongly indecomposable elements of L, because a family of representatives of such equivalence classes would form an infinite family of pairwise disjoint elements.

To prove that every nonzero x∈L majorizes at least one strongly indecomposable element, suppose x > 0 does not. In particular, x is not itself strongly indecomposable, so there exist disjoint nonzero elements x0,  y0 < x. By our assumption on x, the element x0 is not strongly indecomposable, so it in turn majorizes disjoint elements x1,  y1 < x0. Continuing in this manner, we see that y0, [formula] will form an infinite family of pairwise disjoint nonzero elements, contradicting the hypothesis on L.

In the situation above, if [formula] are the equivalence classes of strongly indecomposable elements, and we map each x∈L to the set of those Ei such that x majorizes a member of Ei, this yields a homomorphism of [formula]-semilattices from L to the [formula]-semilattice of subsets of [formula] which sends only 0 to the empty set.

By Corollary [\ref=C.disjoint], if (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid such that W has less than continuum cardinality, the above lemma is applicable to W. More generally, for every w in such a W, that lemma is applicable to the lattice of members of W containing w by Lemma [\ref=L.new_fr_old](iv); moreover these same statements apply to the dual lattice to W by Lemma [\ref=L.new_fr_old](i).

Given elements w < x in a [formula]-semilattice, let us call x strongly indecomposable relative to w if it is strongly indecomposable in the [formula]-semilattice {y∈W|y  ≥  w} (with w regarded as  0 -element). Likewise, in a [formula]-semilattice L with greatest element 1, let us call an element x dually strongly indecomposable if it is strongly indecomposable in the dual [formula]-semilattice; and define dual strong indecomposability relative to an element w > x in the obvious way. Then the above observations give:

Suppose (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid such that W has less than continuum cardinality. Then for every w∈W (including [formula] the set of equivalence classes of elements strongly indecomposable relative to w is finite, and every element > w majorizes at least one such element. Likewise, the set of equivalence classes of elements dually strongly indecomposable relative to w is finite, and every element < w is majorized by at least one such element.

Not only elements of W, but also elements of A have obligatory relationships with equivalence classes of strongly indecomposable elements:

Suppose (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid such that W has less than continuum cardinality. Let us say that an element a∈A dominates an equivalence class E of strongly indecomposable elements if every member of W which contains the element a majorizes some member of E.

Then every a∈A dominates one or more equivalence classes of strongly indecomposable elements of W.

Moreover, if (A,W) is  T1  and a dominates an equivalence class E, then either [formula] or [formula] In the latter case, E is the set of all strongly indecomposable elements of W containing a, E is the only equivalence class dominated by a, and a is the only element dominating E.

Hence if (A,W) as above is  T1  and A is infinite, there exists at least one equivalence class E of strongly indecomposable elements such that [formula]

Suppose some a∈A dominated no equivalence class E of strongly indecomposable elements. Then for each such E we could find a wE∈W containing a but majorizing no member of E. The intersection of these finitely many elements would be a member of W containing a, hence nonempty, but majorizing no strongly indecomposable element, contradicting Lemma [\ref=L.str_indec]. This gives our first conclusion.

If (A,W) is  T1  and a dominates E, then for every b  ≠  a we can find a member of W containing a but not b, and this will majorize an element of E; hence [formula] can contain no b  ≠  a, and so must be [formula] or {a}. In the latter case, it is easy to verify that the set of strongly indecomposable elements of W containing a must coincide with E, giving the first two assertions under this hypothesis. Moreover, for any b  ≠  a, the  T1  property gives a member of W containing b but not a, giving the third assertion.

Since there are only finitely many E, there are only finitely many a dominating equivalence classes E with nonempty intersection; so if A is infinite, we can apply the first conclusion of the lemma to any a not of that sort, and get the final conclusion.

Further observations: If (A,W) is a Pratt comonoid with W countably infinite, and E an equivalence class of strongly indecomposable elements of W having empty intersection, then we see that we can construct an  ω -indexed descending chain [formula] downward cofinal in E, and so in particular, having empty intersection. Given the countability of W, Proposition [\ref=P.continuum] implies that for any ascending chain [formula] in W, there must be some m and n such that

[formula]

But in fact, we had enough information to see that without calling on Proposition [\ref=P.continuum]. On the one hand, [\eqref=d.geq] holds for all m and n if [formula] On the other hand, if this intersection is nonempty, that means some yn has nonempty intersection with x0. That intersection belongs to E, hence will majorize some xm, and the relation yn > xm then implies [\eqref=d.geq].

Though such increasing and decreasing chains do not have the properties that would allow us to call on Proposition [\ref=P.continuum] and get a contradiction, they do lead to the following result, which contrasts with the behavior of the examples of Theorems [\ref=T.2^*w] and [\ref=T.T1_nondiscrete].

If (A,W) is a  T1  Pratt comonoid with W countably infinite, then there exist crosswords over W with infinitely many distinct rows and columns.

As noted above, we can construct an infinite descending chain (xm) with empty intersection, and by duality, an infinite ascending chain (yn) with union A. Without loss of generality, let us take these chains to be strictly decreasing and strictly increasing respectively. Then [formula] will be the desired crossword. Indeed, given a∈A, let m be the greatest integer such that a∈xm; then we see that the row of C indexed by a will be given by ym∈W, and a dual statement applies to columns; so the rows and columns of C comprise precisely [formula] an infinite subset of W.

Here is another sort of chain that we can construct in any infinite  T1  Pratt comonoid with W countable, or more generally, with [formula] both less than the continuum and less than [formula] The relativized version of Lemma [\ref=L.a] [\ref=E] shows that for every w∈W there are only finitely many elements a∉w which dominate equivalence classes relative to w that have intersection strictly larger than w. Since [formula] there must be an a which, relative to every w not containing it, dominates no such equivalence classes. Now starting a recursion with [formula] assume we have elements [formula] each strongly indecomposable relative to the one before, with a∉yi - 1. Then we can take an equivalence class Ei of elements strongly indecomposable relative to yi - 1 which is dominated by a relative to yi - 1, and take a yi∈Ei which does not contain a. We thus get an infinite chain with these properties; but how this fact might be useful we again don't know.

If we assume the negation of the continuum hypothesis, then the example of Theorem [\ref=T.T1_nondiscrete] has W of less than continuum cardinality, hence Corollary [\ref=C.str_indec], Lemma [\ref=L.a] [\ref=E], and the observation of the last paragraph apply to that example. Thus, we cannot expect those results to yield contradictions without some stronger assumption, such as that W be countable.

A question we have not studied, which is also suggested by Theorem [\ref=T.T1_nondiscrete], is:

Assuming the negation of the continuum hypothesis, can there exist a non-discrete  T1  Pratt comonoid (A,W) whose base-set A has less than continuum cardinality?

Generalizing the construction of

Let us pick up a loose end. In §[\ref=S.2^*w] we saw that the lattice of subsets of A = 2ω generated by [formula] formed a Pratt comonoid. We sketch here, as promised in the paragraph preceding Corollary [\ref=C.isolated], a generalization of that result.

First let us generalize Corollary [\ref=C.isolated]. For brevity we will not, this time, include condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=L.isolated] among the equivalent conditions in the statement, though the equivalence of conditions (i) and (ii) of that lemma will still be essential to the proof.

Let (Ai)i∈I be any family of finite partially ordered sets, such that each Ai has a least element 0i and a greatest element 1i, and let [formula] with [formula] the componentwise partial ordering. Let S be the set of elements of A which have  i -th coordinate 0i for all but at most one i, and S' the set of elements having  i -th coordinate 1i for all but at most one i. Then the following conditions on an element x∈U⊆(A) are equivalent.

(i) x is an isolated point of U⊆(A) under the natural topology.

(ii) x is the inverse image under the projection of A onto a finite sub-product [formula] (where [formula] are distinct elements of I) of an up-set of that sub-product.

(iii) x lies in the lattice of up-sets of A generated by [formula] and the elements [formula] for s∈S.

(iv) [formula] lies in the lattice of down-sets of A generated by [formula] and the elements [formula] for s∈S'.

We shall show (i)[formula](ii)[formula](iii), whence by symmetry also (ii)[formula](iv), and then that (iii)[formula](iv)[formula](i).

The proof that (i)[formula](ii) follows the idea of Corollary [\ref=C.isolated] (i)[formula](ii)[formula](iii). Assuming (i), we can, by Lemma [\ref=L.isolated](ii), write x as a union [formula] with each aj∈A, and we can assume without loss of generality that none of the aj majorizes any of the others. If any of the aj had infinitely many nonzero coordinates, then we could write [formula] as an intersection of principal up-sets determined by elements [formula] which take finitely many nonzero coordinates from aj, and have zero-elements in all other coordinates. As in the proof of that corollary, this would make x a limit, in the natural topology on U⊆(A), of elements ≠  x, contradicting (i). Hence x is a join of finitely many elements each constraining only finitely many coordinates of elements of A. If we write [formula] for the full set of indices whose coordinates x constrains, we see that x is the inverse image of a subset of [formula] which will be an up-set in that product, proving (ii).

To get (ii)[formula](iii), note that since [formula] is a finite partially ordered set, every up-set of that set is a finite (possibly empty) union of principal up-sets. Writing such a principal up-set as [formula] we see that it is the intersection over [formula] of the principal up-sets determined by the elements which have aj in the ij coordinate and zeroes in all other coordinates. Hence the inverse image of that up-set in A is the intersection of the principal up-sets of A having the same descriptions, but with "other coordinates" now ranging over I rather than just [formula] This leads to the description of x as in (iii). The reverse implication is clear.

By symmetry, we likewise get (ii)[formula](iv).

Finally, (iii)[formula](iv) immediately gives Lemma [\ref=L.isolated](ii), and hence (i).

This leads to the following generalization of Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w].

For A a partially ordered set constructed as in Lemma [\ref=L.prod_A_i], the set W of all up-sets of A that satisfy the equivalent conditions of that lemma is a Pratt comonoid structure on A.

Let us note how to adapt the proof of Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w]. Condition (iii) of Lemma [\ref=L.prod_A_i], which is analogous to the hypothesis of that theorem, makes for the easiest translation of the proof. We replace occurrences of "2" in that proof, where they represent value-sets of coordinates of elements of A, by the appropriate finite partially ordered sets Ai, while where 2 occurs as the value-set of members of W  ⊆  2A, it remains unchanged.

In Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w], the generators en:A  →  2 of W were projections to the  n -th coordinates. The corresponding generators [formula] (s∈S) of our present W can be regarded as composite maps A  →  Ai  →  2, where the first arrow is the projection onto the  i -th component, and the second is the characteristic function of the principal up-set determined by some element of Ai. Thus, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w], they are continuous maps. Where A was included in our list of lattice generators in Theorem [\ref=T.2^*w], it does not require separate mention here, since it can be written [formula] but [formula] is still needed, and indeed appears in Lemma [\ref=L.prod_A_i](iii).

Appendix: Background on the concept of Pratt comonoid

In [\cite=chu], [\cite=chu_online], [\cite=comonoid] Vaughan Pratt studies, for Σ a set, the category [formula] whose objects, Chu spaces, are pairs (A,r,X), where A and X are sets, and r:A  ×  X  →  Σ a set map, and where a morphism (A,r,X)  →  (B,s,Y) is given by a pair of set-maps, f:A  →  B and g:Y  →  X such that s(f(a),y) = r(a,g(y)) for a∈A, y∈Y. These spaces are used to model various programming concepts. It is noted in [\cite=chu_online] that the definition is based on ideas from the Master's thesis of Po Hsiang Chu.

If one restricts attention to objects (A,r,X) such that distinct elements of X induce distinct maps on A, then one can regard X as a set of maps x:A  →  Σ, and drop the map r from the description of these objects. If one also takes Σ = 2 = {0,1}, then X, now a set of  {0,1} -valued functions on A, can be regarded as a set of distinguished subsets of A, and morphisms (A,X)  →  (B,Y) correspond to set-maps A  →  B under which the inverse image of every distinguished subset of B is a distinguished subset of A. Pratt notes that various sorts of mathematical structures can be described as instances of Chu spaces; for instance, the category of topological spaces can be considered a subcategory of [formula] determined by the condition that the distinguished subsets are closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.

Given objects (A,X) and (B,Y) of [formula] Pratt defines [formula] to be the object whose first component is the set A  ×  B, and whose second component is the set of those maps A  ×  B  →  Σ which form "crosswords" with rows from Y and columns from X. He then defines a comonoid in [formula] to be an object (A,X) given with a map [formula] which makes certain diagrams commute, dual to the diagrams of set-maps that define the ordinary concept of monoid.

(The first author of this note, having worked with coalgebra objects as representing objects for algebra-valued functors [\cite=coalg], prefers to use the unmodified term "comonoid" for an object given with an appropriate sort of morphism into the coproduct of two copies of itself, and would call an object of the sort Pratt considers a "[formula]-comonoid".)

Pratt then shows that a morphism [formula] can satisfy this definition of comonoid if and only if it is determined by the diagonal map A  →  A  ×  A; so such comonoids correspond to objects (A,X) with the property that their diagonal maps are morphisms; in other words, that every "crossword" over X determines, via its diagonal, an element of X.

In [\cite=comonoid] and [\cite=puzzle], Pratt focuses on the case Σ = 2, and, in view of the fact that these comonoids can be developed, for the nonspecialist, in language that does not require familiarity with the category [formula] defines them roughly as we have done here, emphasizing the "crossword" metaphor. We have deviated from his notation only in replacing X with W, as a mnemonic for "words".
