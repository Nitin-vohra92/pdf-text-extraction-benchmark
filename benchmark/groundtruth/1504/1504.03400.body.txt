Introduction

Let X be a non-singular quasi-projective variety of dimension n defined over a field of arbitrary characteristic, and let E be a vector bundle of rank r over X. Let [formula] be the Grassmann bundle of E over X parametrizing corank d subbundles of E with projection [formula], and let [formula] be the universal quotient bundle of rank d on [formula]. We denote by θ the first Chern class c1( det Q) = c1(Q) of Q, and call θ the Plücker class of [formula]. Note that the determinant bundle det Q is isomorphic to the pull-back of the tautological line bundle [formula] of [formula] by the relative Plücker embedding over X.

The purpose of this short note is to give a closed formula for π*θN, the push-forward of powers θN of the Plücker class θ to X by π, in terms of the Schur polynomials in Segre classes of E, where [formula] is the push-forward by π between the Chow rings.

The result is

For each integer N  ≥  d(r - d), we have

[formula]

in AN - d(r - d)(X), where [formula] is a partition with [formula], [formula] is the Schur polynomial in Segre classes of E corresponding to λ, [formula], and fλ  +  ε is the number of standard Young tableaux with shape λ  +  ε.

The Segre classes si(E) here are the ones satisfying [formula] as in [\cite=fujita], [\cite=laksov], [\cite=laksov-thorup], where s(E) and c(E) denote respectively the total Segre class and the total Chern class of E. Note that our Segre class si(E) differs by the sign ( - 1)i from the one in [\cite=fulton].

If X is projective and [formula] is very ample, then [formula] is embedded in the projective space [formula] by the tautological line bundle [formula], and its degree is given by

[formula]

Here a vector bundle F over X is said to be very ample if the tautological line bundle [formula] of [formula] is very ample.

Setting n: = 0, we recover the degree formula of Grassmann varieties, as follows:

Let [formula] be the Grassmann variety parametrizing codimension d subspaces of a vector space of dimension r. Then its degree with respect to the Plücker embedding is given by

[formula]

Proofs

Let [formula] be the Chern roots of the universal quotient bundle Q. Then we can write [formula] formally. Using Pieri's formula [\cite=fulton-young] repeatedly, and applying Jacobi-Trudi identity [\cite=macdonald], we obtain that

[formula]

where [formula] is the Schur polynomial in [formula] corresponding to a partition μ. It follows from the push-forward formula of Józefiak-Lascoux-Pragacz [\cite=jlp] that

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

where λ is a partition, and [formula].

By the assumption [formula] is projective and the tautological line bundle [formula] defines an embedding [formula]. Therefore [formula] is considered to be a projective variety in [formula] via the relative Plücker embedding [formula] over X defined by the quotient [formula]. Since the hyperplane section class of [formula] is equal to the Plücker class θ, we obtain the conclusion, taking [formula] in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main_theorem].

The conclusion follows from Corollary [\ref=corollary:degree_formula] with n: = 0, since the number fλ  +  ε is known to be given as follows ([\cite=fulton-young] and [\cite=fulton-young]):

Under the same assumption as in Theorem [\ref=theorem:main_theorem], one can prove a push-forward formula of the following form: in [formula], where [formula] with [formula], and si(E) is the i-th Segre class of E.
