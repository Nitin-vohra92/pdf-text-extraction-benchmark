Some Minimal Shape Decompositions Are Nice

In a Nutshell

In some sense, the world is composed of shapes and words, of continuous things and discrete things. The recognition and study of continuous objects in the form of shapes occupies a significant part of the effort of unraveling many geometric questions. Shapes can be represented with great generality by objects called currents. While the enormous variety and representational power of currents is useful for representing a huge variety of phenomena, it also leads to the problem that knowing something is a respectable current tells you little about how nice or regular it is. In these brief notes I give an intuitive explanation of a result that says that an important class of minimal shape decompositions will be nice if the input shape (current) is nice. These notes are an exposition of the paper by Ibrahim, Krishnamoorthy and Vixie [\cite=ibrahim-2014-flat-arXiv] which can be found on the arXiv: and any reference to these notes, should include a reference to that paper as well.

Shapes and Currents

We begin by representing shapes as k-currents which, for this section, should be thought of as oriented k-dimensional subsets of [formula] (0  ≤  k  ≤  n) that are locally flat almost everywhere.

It turns out that currents are a deep generalization of sets like 2-dimensional surfaces in [formula] or 1-dimensional curves in [formula] or [formula]. This is both very helpful, because we can represent a large class of things very naturally, and challenging, because knowing something is a respectable current no longer implies it is in some small class of relatively tame objects.

As a result of this diversity, we are naturally led to classify currents into different subspaces - e.g. integral, normal, or flat currents - and when we find that some problem has a current as a solution, we then occupy ourselves with finding out which of these classes that current falls into. This in turn tells us how tame (how regular) it is. The nicest class is the class of integral currents. Proving that a current is in a smaller, more regular set of currents can sometimes be very challenging.

Shapes and Currents: Examples

Distances Between Shapes: The Multiscale Flat Norm

A first requirement for studying collections of objects is a distance between those objects. When those objects are currents there is a very natural distance called the flat norm, [formula]. This distance begins by decomposing the input k-current T into two pieces T  =  (T  -  ∂S)  +  ∂S, where S is a k+1-current. Now we measure the cost of the decomposition as M(T  -  ∂S)  +  λM(S) . Finally, we minimize this cost over all possible decompositions (i.e. over all possible k+1 currents S):

[formula]

While it might seem difficult to compute the flat norm, the realization that the flat norm is connected to the L1TV functional from image analysis[\cite=morgan-2007-1] permits efficient calculation for the case when T is an (n-1)-dimensional boundary of an n-dimensional set in [formula]. (In the figure above, T is such an object: it is the 1-dimensional boundary of a 2-dimensional subset of the plane.) In this "co-dimension 1 boundary" case, we can use a variety of algorithms to find the minimal decompositions. One efficient method is the graph-cut method which has been used to to calculate good approximations to the minimal decompositions for shapes in [formula][\cite=vixie-2010-2]. Now we are ready for the main result in the paper we are aiming to explain.

When does Integral T →   Integral S?

Using currents to represent shapes, and the flat norm to measure size and distances in the space of currents leads us to the question:

Is the S minimizing M(T - ∂S)  +  λM(S) nice when the input T is nice?

In our case, we consider a current to be nice if it is an integral current. These correspond to unions of pieces of smooth k-dimensional surfaces in [formula], such that the k-dimensional volume of the union and the (k-1)-dimensional volume of its boundary are both finite. So the question can be restated:

Is the S minimizing M(T - ∂S)  +  λM(S) integral when T is integral?

To get to the answer, we introduce a bit more terminology: We say a set [formula] has co-dimension k if dim (E)  =  n - k.

Previous to this work what was known could be summed up in two statements:

Together [\cite=chan-2005-1] [\cite=morgan-2007-1] show that when T is a co-dimension 1 boundary in [formula], there is a minimizing integral S.

In [\cite=ibrahim-2013-simplicial] it is shown that co-dimension 1 T's have minimizing integral S's in the case that the T and S live on a simplicial complex. Note that T need not be a boundary, though it must be a discrete, simplicial current!

The Punchline

The main result of the paper by Ibrahim, Krishnamoorthy and Vixie[\cite=ibrahim-2014-flat-arXiv] uses the results for discrete, simplicial currents to prove that the flat norm decompositions of arbitrary co-dimension 1 integral currents are also well behaved:

In essence, the argument for the main result boils down to the observation that if T is integral and there is not an integral minimizer then this implies, after lots of fussing around and using modified deformation theorems and special simplicial refinements and adaptations, that we can produce a integral simplicial current that also does not have an integral minimizer. And that is a contradiction, according to the results in [\cite=ibrahim-2013-simplicial].

The paper also uses the isoperimetric inequality to prove that when T is a boundary and λ is small enough, the flat norm minimization becomes a minimal surface problem. This is used to conclude that:

because of examples of 1-dimensional boundaries in [formula] for which there are spanning currents S such that M(S)  <  M(E) for any integral E with ∂E  =  T [\cite=morgan-1984-area].

The case of co-dimension 2 is completely open, except for the fact that we know we cannot use minimal surface problems to find counterexamples [\cite=morgan-1984-area].

Post Script

While it is true that integral currents are much more regular than arbitrary currents, they are not almost smooth manifolds. In order to dispel that notion, we give some examples of nice but non-trivial integral 1-currents in [formula]. While it is true that there can only be a finite number of non-closed curves in an integral 1-current, that doesn't mean such a 1-current is simple. A current that is the union of 100,000 curves each with length of 2 or less will have a 1-dimensional volume of at most 200,000 and a 0-dimensional boundary volume of 200,000. Since both of these numbers are less than ∞  , the current is an integral current.

An integral 1-current can have an infinite number of circles as long as the sum of the circumferences of the circles is finite. For example, the following is an integral current. Begin by enumerating all the points in the unit square having rational coordinates, p1  =  (x1,y1),p2  =  (x1,y2), ... . Now let C(x,r) be the circle centered at x with radius r, oriented counterclockwise. Finally, define

[formula]

We then have that M(T)  =  2π and M(∂T)  =  0, so T is a "nice" integral 1-current.

In the case of k-currents in [formula], n  >  2, things can be even more interesting since we can now have an infinite number of pieces having boundary ("non-closed" pieces) as long as the total boundary mass is finite.
