Proximally well-monotone covers and QH-singularity

Introduction

The Hausdorff distance, a distance function on the collection of subsets of a metric space, was first introduced by Hausdorff in [\cite=Hausdorff]. A slight variation of this concept, however, had been defined earlier by Pompeiu in [\cite=Pompeiu]. The Hausdorff distance has had many applications in various branches of mathematics since its first appearance and, even though it has been around for quite a while, it is still an essential tool in pattern detection and face recognition software.

Similar to the way one can construct the Hausdorff distance on the hyperspace of a metric space (X,d), one can define a quasi-uniformity UH given a quasi-uniform space (X,U). This filter of entourages UH forms a quasi-uniformity on the collection P(X) of all subsets of X and is referred to as the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity or Hausdorff-Bourbaki quasi-uniformity associated with U.

Whenever two Hausdorff quasi-uniformities UH and VH induce the same topology the quasi-uniformities U and V are called QH-equivalent (see [\cite=Cao]). When working in the symmetric setting (and thus only studying uniformities) this concept is also called H-equivalence. Smith [\cite=Smith] and Ward [\cite=Ward1] [\cite=Ward2] laid the foundations for the analysis of H-equivalent uniformities. Among other results, Smith proved that metrisable uniformities and totally bounded uniformities are H-singular, i.e. there are no distinct uniformities that are H-equivalent to them. Distinct uniformities U and V on a set X can generate Hausdorff quasi-uniformities with the same underlying topology on the hyperspace P(X). Nevertheless, Poljakov [\cite=Poljakov] has shown that whenever (UH)H and (VH)H define the same topology on P(P(X)), the uniformities U and V must coincide.

In the asymmetric case the concept of QH-equivalence behaves somewhat differently. First of all Cao et al. [\cite=Cao] gave examples of quasi-uniform spaces that were either quasi-metrisable or totally bounded, but not QH-singular. Furthermore, Künzi showed in [\cite=Kunzi] that Poljakov's result does not hold in the asymmetric case. In this paper we will investigate QH-singularity by means of proximally well-monotone covers. In particular we will give some results on quasi-metrisable spaces and totally bounded spaces that are QH-singular.

Preliminaries

Let X be a set and U,V  ⊆  X  ×  X relations on X. For an x∈X we define U(x) as {y∈X  |  (x,y)∈U}. The relation [formula] contains all (x,z) for which there is a y∈X such that y∈U(x) and z∈V(y). We will denote [formula] as U2 and [formula] as Un + 1 whenever n  ≥  2. A sequence (Un)n of relations on X is called a normal sequence iff U2n + 1  ⊆  Un for each n.

A filter U on X  ×  X is called a quasi-uniformity iff it has the following properties:

[formula],

[formula].

The elements of a quasi-uniformity U will be called entourages. The pair (X,U) is a quasi-uniform space. Let U be a relation on a quasi-uniform space (X,U). We will say that U is normal with respect to U iff there is a normal sequence (Un)n of entourages in U where U0 is equal to U. Whenever it is clear in which quasi-uniformity we are working we will simply say that U is normal. It is clear that each entourage of a quasi-uniformity is normal.

Each quasi-uniformity U has an underlying topology τ(U). In this topology the neighbourhoodfilter of a point x is generated by the sets U(x) with U∈U. The quasi-uniformity U- 1 is called the conjugate of U and consists of all entourages U- 1, where

[formula]

The filter Us that is generated by the relations [formula] is a quasi-uniformity that is called the symmetrisation of U. If U is equal to its own symmetrisation, then U is called a uniformity and (X,U) a uniform space. For an extensive monograph on quasi-uniform spaces we refer the reader to [\cite=Fletcher].

The set of all subsets of X will be denoted as P(X). For a subset A∈P(X) and an entourage U∈U we define U(A) as

[formula]

A subset A of a quasi-uniform space is uniformly isolated iff there is an entourage U with the property U(A) equals A. A quasi-uniform space (X,U) in which each uniformly isolated subset is either empty of the entire space X will be called uniformly connected. For a given quasi-uniform space (X,U) the relation ≪   on P(X) is defined such that A  ≪  B iff there is a U∈U with the property that U(A)  ⊆  B.

For any relation U on X we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

If (X,U) is a quasi-uniform space, then the filter generated by the sets U- is a quasi-uniformity on P(X) that we will call the lower Hausdorff quasi-uniformity. Analogously, the sets U+ generate the upper Hausdorff quasi-uniformity on P(X). We will denote the intersection [formula] as UH. The Hausdorff quasi-uniformity UH on the hyperspace P(X) is the filter that is generated by the sets UH.

If U and V are two quasi-uniformities on a set X, then we say that V is QH-finer than U iff τ(UH)  ⊆  τ(VH). If the topologies τ(UH) and τ(VH) are equal, then we say that U and V are QH-equivalent. A quasi-uniformity U is called QH-singular iff there is no quasi-uniformity, other than U itself, that is QH-equivalent to U.

Let (X,q) be a quasi-pseudometric space. The conjugate quasi-metric q- 1 on X is defined such that q- 1(x,y) is equal to q(y,x) for all x,y∈X. The metric [formula] is generally denoted as qs. Its underlying uniformity is equal to the symmetrisation of the underlying quasi-uniformity of q. A quasi-pseudometric space (X,q) will be called QH-singular iff its underlying quasi-uniformity is QH-singular For a set A  ⊆  X and an x∈X the value q(x,A) is defined as inf {q(x,a)|a∈A}.

Proximally Well-monotone Covers

In this section we will introduce proximally well-monotone covers of a quasi-uniform space. We will use these covers to construct quasi-uniformities that are QH-equivalent to a given quasi-uniformity.

The following results generalise a theorem of Albrecht [\cite=Albrecht] on the comparison of Hausdorff uniformities. We will use them extensively throughout this text to investigate QH-equivalence of quasi-uniformities.

If U and V are relations on X and A a subset of X, then UH(A)  ⊆  VH(A) iff U(A)  ⊆  V(A) and for each x∈A there is an y∈A with the property U(y)  ⊆  V(x).

First we will prove the sufficiency of this proposition. Suppose B is an element of UH(A), then we know that by definition B  ⊆  U(A) and thus B  ⊆  V(A). Now take an x∈A and a y∈A such that U(y)  ⊆  V(x). By assumption we can find a z∈B with y∈U- 1(z). This means that z∈U(y)  ⊆  V(x) and that A  ⊆  V- 1(B). We can conclude that B is an element of VH(A).

Conversely, assume that UH(A)  ⊆  VH(A). It is clear that the conditions stated in the proposition are true if A is empty. So let us assume that A is non-empty and take an x∈U(A). It is clear that the set [formula] is an element of UH(A) and thus of VH(A). This implies that we can find a y∈A such that x∈V(y) and therefore x∈V(A). Hence we have that U(A)  ⊆  V(A). Now let x be an element of A and assume that there is no y∈A for which U(y)  ⊆  V(x). Choose for each y∈A a [formula] and define B as {zy|y∈A}. By construction we have that B is an element of UH(A) and thus of VH(A). This, however, cannot be possible since there is no zy∈B for which zy∈V(x).

From this proposition we immediately obtain the following result that describes when a quasi-uniformity U is QH-finer than V.

U is QH-finer than V iff for each A  ⊆  X and V∈V there is a U∈U such that U(A)  ⊆  V(A) and for each x∈A there is an y∈A with the property U(y)  ⊆  V(x).

Let G be a cover of X that is well-ordered for the inclusion order and that does not have a maximal element. From here on we will denote the successor of an element G in such a collection for this well-order as G+. Because we assumed that G does not have a maximal element we know that each G in fact has a successor. From this point on we will assume that (X,U) is a quasi-uniform space.

We will call a family (UG)G∈G of entourages that is indexed by a collection G of subsets of X decreasing if and only if UG'  ⊇  UG whenever G'  ⊆  G. It will be called normally decreasing iff we can find decreasing families (U(G,n))G∈G such that for each G∈G we have that (U(G,n))n is a normal sequence for UG.

A cover G of X will be called a proximally well-monotone cover iff all of its elements are non-empty, it is well-ordered for the inclusion order, does not have a maximal element and there is a normally decreasing family (UG)G∈G of entourages such that UG(G)  ⊆  G+ for each G∈G.

A quasi-pseudometric q will be called uniformly continuous for a quasi-uniform space (X,U) iff {(x,y)∈X  ×  X|q(x,y) < ε} is an entourage for each ε > 0. Each quasi-uniform space is uniquely defined by the collection of all uniformly continuous quasi-pseudometrics. The following result defines proximally well-monotone covers in terms of quasi-pseudometrics. For a set A  ⊆  X and an ε > 0 we define Aεq as [formula].

A cover G of X is proximally well-monotone iff it all of its elements are non-empty, is well-ordered for the inclusion order, does not have a maximal element and there is a family (qG)G∈G of uniformly continuous quasi-pseudometrics and an ε > 0 such that qG  ≤  qG' whenever G  ⊆  G' and GεqG  ⊆  G+ for each G∈G.

Suppose that G is a cover that satisfies the conditions stated in the proposition. Define U(G,n) as {(x,y)∈X  ×  X  |  qG(x,y) < 2- nε}. Since each qG is uniformly continuous we have that each U(G,n) is an entourage. It is clear from the definition that for each n the family (U(G,n))G∈G is decreasing and that each (U(G,n))n is a normal sequence. Furthermore, we also have that for each G∈G the set U(G,0)(G) is equal to GεqG and thus a subset of G+. We can conclude that G is a proximally well-monotone cover.

Let G be a proximally well-monotone cover. By definition we can find for each n a decreasing family (U(G,n))G∈G such that for each G we have that U(G,0)(G)  ⊆  G+ and (U(G,n))n is a normal sequence. In [\cite=Kelley] Kelley showed that given a sequence of entourages (Vn)n of a quasi-uniform space with the property that V4n + 1  ⊆  Vn for each n, we can always construct a quasi-pseudometric q such that

[formula]

Since for each G∈G the sequence (U(G,2n))n satisfies this property this means that we can construct a quasi-pseudometric qG that satisfies

[formula]

for each n. Take G  ⊆  G'∈G. According to Kelley's construction, the quasi-pseudometric qG is the least upper bound of all quasi-pseudometrics q for which q(x,y) is less than or equal to

[formula]

Suppose G  ⊆  G'. For every n, since the family (U(G,n))G∈G is decreasing, we have that U(G,n)  ⊇  U(G',n). Hence, for every x,y∈X, we get

[formula]

and therefore qG  ≤  qG'. By definition we have that G1qG  ⊆  U(G,0)(G)  ⊆  G+ for each G∈G. This means that the conditions stated in the proposition are satisfied.

If (Gn)n is a strictly increasing sequence of non-empty sets that cover X with the property that Gn  ≪  Gn + 1 for each n, then the collection of all Gn is a proximally well-monotone cover of X.

That (Gn)n is well-ordered for the inclusion order and does not have a maximal element follows from our assumptions. Choose a sequence (Un)n of entourages such that Un(Gn)  ⊆  Gn + 1. Without loss of generality we can assume that (Un)n is decreasing. Let (V(n,m))m be a normal sequence for Un. Define W(n,m) as [formula] It is clear that each (W(n,m))m is a normal sequence for Un and that the sequence (W(n,m))n is decreasing. This means that (Un)n is normally decreasing and that the collection of all sets Gn is a proximally well-monotone cover.

Let G be a proximally well-monotone cover of X. Since each x∈X is contained in one of the elements of G, so we can define the relation UG on X such that UG(x) is equal to G+, where G is the smallest element of G that contains x.

Let (X,U) be a uniformly connected quasi-uniform space. If G is a proximally well-monotone cover, then we can find a proximally well-monotone cover G* such that (UG*)2  ⊆  UG.

Since G is proximally well-monotone we can find a normally decreasing family (UG)G∈G such that (UG)2(G)  ⊆  G+. Define G* as the union of G and {UG(G)|G∈G}. It is clear from the construction that this set only contains non-empty subsets, cannot have a maximal element and that it is still a cover of X.

The set G* is well-ordered for the inclusion order. If H is a non-empty subset of G* the set {G∈G|G∈HUG(G)∈H} has a minimum GH in G. Suppose GH∈H. Any other element in H is equal to either G or UG(G) for some G∈G. Since GH  ⊆  G  ⊆  UG(G) we find that GH is the minimum of the set H. Let us now assume that [formula]. This yields that UGH(GH)∈H. We know that for each G∈H that is also contained in G we have that GH  ⊆  G. Since we assumed that GH is not contained in H we know that G must be strictly larger than GH. Because G is well-ordered this yields that (GH)+  ⊆  G and thus we have UGH(GH)  ⊆  (GH)+  ⊆  G. On the other hand if UG(G)∈H with G∈G, then GH  ⊆  G. This implies that UGH(GH)  ⊆  UG(G). In case G equals GH this is trivially true. If G is strictly larger than GH we find UGH(GH)  ⊆  (GH)+  ⊆  G  ⊆  UG(G). We can conclude that UGH(GH) is the minimum of H.

So far we have established that G* is a well-ordered family of non-empty sets without maximal element. To prove that it is also proximally well-monotone we take an arbitrary G*∈G*. If G* is not contained in G, then by definition this means that G* is equal to UG(G) for some unique G∈G. Define UG* as UG. If G* is an element of G, then UG* is just the entourage that we defined earlier. It is clear that (UG*)G*∈ is a normally decreasing family. If G* is equal to UG(G) for some G∈G, then the successor of G* in G* must contain G+. Suppose that it is not equal to G+. This implies that UG(G) = G+ and thus UG(UG(G)) = G+, but this means that G+ is uniformly isolated and we assumed that (X,U) is uniformly connected. By definition we have that UG*(G*) = UG(UG(G))  ⊆  G+. On the other hand, if G* is an element in G, then again from the uniform connectedness of (X,U) it follows that its successor in G* is equal to UG*(G*). This means that G* is a proximally well-monotone cover of X.

The only thing that is left to prove is the fact that (UG*)2  ⊆  UG. Take an x∈X and let Gx be the smallest element in G* that contains x. If Gx is an element of G, then UG*(x) is equal to UGx(Gx) and for a y∈UG*(x) we have that UG*(y) is a subset of the successor of Gx in G. Since UG(x) is equal to the successor of Gx in G we find that (UG*)2(x)  ⊆  UG(x). If Gx is equal to UG(G) for some G∈G, then UG*(x) is equal to the successor G+ of G in G and UG(x) equals the successor of G+ in G. This means that for any y∈UG*(x) the set UG*(y) is a subset of UG+(G+) and thus (UG*)2(x)  ⊆  UG+(G+)  ⊆  UG(x).

If G is a proximally well-monotone cover, then we can find a sequence (Gn)n of proximally well-monotone covers such that (UGn)n is a normal sequence for UG.

Let (X,U) be a quasi-uniform space. If G is a proximally well-monotone cover, then (UG)H is an element of UH.

Let (UG)G∈G be a normally decreasing sequence for G and take an A  ⊆  X. We will verify that UG satisfies the conditions given in proposition [\ref=qhfiner]. Assume that A is a subset of an element of G. Define G1 as the smallest element of G that intersects with A and G2 as the smallest set in G that contains A. It is clear that G1 must be a subset of G2. We now have UG2(A)  ⊆  UG2(G2)  ⊆  G+2 = UG(A). Take an x∈A. We know that UG2  ⊆  UG1. For an arbitrary [formula] we find that

[formula]

We find that UG2 satisfies the conditions stated in proposition [\ref=qhfiner] and thus we have that (UG2)H(A)  ⊆  UG(A).

Now assume that A is not contained in any element of G. Define G1 again as the smallest element of G that intersects with A. For each G∈G we can find an x∈A such that [formula] and thus G  ⊆  UG(x). Because G is a cover of X we obtain that UG(A) is equal to X. This implies that UG1(A)  ⊆  UG(A). With the same arguments as we used above we can argue that for each x∈A there is a y∈A with UG1(y)  ⊆  UG(x) and therefore we can conclude that (UG1)H(A)  ⊆  UG(A).

Let (X,U) be a quasi-uniform space. Let G be a proximally well-monotone cover with the property that for each U∈U and each A  ⊆  X that is not contained in any element of G there is a G∈G such that for each [formula] we can find:

an a' in [formula] with x∈U(a') whenever G'∈G,

an [formula] such that a∈U(x).

For each V∈U we have that [formula].

Let (UG)G∈G be a normally decreasing family, take V∈U and A  ⊆  X. First let us assume that A is contained in an element G of G. By definition this means that UG(a)  ⊆  UG(a) for each a∈A and thus [formula]. Clearly this implies that [formula].

From here on we will assume that A is not contained in any element of G. Choose U∈U such that U2  ⊆  V. We can assume that each UG is contained in U. If this is not the case we choose a normal sequence (Un)n of entourages for U and decreasing families (U(G,n))G∈G such that each (U(G,n))n is a normal sequence for UG. It is clear that for each n the family [formula] is again decreasing and that [formula] is a normal sequence for [formula] for all G∈G.

For the entourage U that we chose we can find a G∈G with the properties that are stated above. We will prove that [formula] is a neighbourhood of A for τ(VH) by using proposition [\ref=qhfiner]. We will start with proving that [formula]. Let y be an element of UG(A). Take x∈A such that y∈UG(x). Let us suppose that x is not contained in G. Choose a G'∈G that is larger than G and contains both the elements x and y. Such a G' exists since G is a well-ordered cover of X. By assumption we can now find an [formula] such that x∈U(a'). Since a' is not contained in G' and y is, we automatically have y∈UG(a'). Because x∈U(a') and y∈UG(x)  ⊆  U(x) we get y∈V(a') and thus [formula]. In case x is an element of G we know that UG(x)  ⊆  UGx(x) = UG(x), where Gx is the smallest set in G that contains x and thus y∈UG(x). Since UG  ⊆  V and y∈UG(x) this implies that y is contained in [formula].

Take an x∈A. We need to prove that there is an element a∈A such that [formula]. If x is not contained in G, then we already saw that [formula]. This means that in this case we can choose a to be equal to x. Suppose x is not contained in G. By assumption we can find for such an x an [formula] with the property a∈U(x). If we take a z∈UG(a), then z is also contained in UG(G) and therefore in G+. Because [formula] this means that each element of G that contains x contains G+ and thus contains z. This implies that z∈UG(x). Moreover, it follows from z∈UG(a), a∈U(x) and UG  ⊆  U that z∈V(x). Hence [formula].

Let (X,U) be a quasi-uniform space and U an entourage. We will say that a set A  ⊆  X is U-small iff A  ×  A  ⊆  U. Let α be a cardinal number. A set A will be called U-α-bounded iff A is equal to the union of a family (Ai)i∈I of U-small sets such that |I| < α. An α-bounded set will be a set that is U-α-bounded for each entourage U∈U. It is clear from these definitions that a set is totally bounded iff it is [formula]-bounded.

Let G be a collection of subsets of X. Recall that a subset G' of G is cofinal iff each G∈G is contained in an element of G'. The minimal cardinality of all cofinal subsets of G is called its cofinality and is generally denoted as [formula].

If G is a proximally well-monotone cover of X with the property that for each U∈U there is a G∈G such that [formula] is U-[formula]-bounded, then [formula] for each V∈U.

We will prove that G satisfies the conditions stated in proposition [\ref=monotonehaus]. Let A be a subset of X that is not contained in any element of G and take an entourage U∈U. Choose G1∈G such that [formula] is U-[formula]-bounded. We can now write [formula] as the union of a collection (Ai)i∈I of U-small sets with [formula]. Let J be the set that contains all i∈I for which Ai is contained in an element of G. Choose for each i∈J a Gi∈G such that Ai  ⊆  Gi. Since [formula] there must be a G2∈G that contains each Gi with i∈J. If this were not the case, then (Gi)i∈J would be a cofinal collection with cardinality strictly smaller than [formula]. Without loss of generality we can assume that G2 is larger than G1.

Since for each [formula] we have that [formula] we can choose an ai in [formula]. There must be a G0∈G that contains all ai with [formula]. Suppose this were not true, then we could choose a Gi∈G such that ai∈Gi for each [formula] and because no element G of G contains each ai this collection [formula] would be cofinal. This is impossible because [formula]. Since G0 contains the elements ai, that are not contained G2, we know that it must contain G2.

We will now show that this set G0 satisfies the conditions that are stated in proposition [\ref=monotonehaus]. Let x be an element of [formula]. By construction x must be an element of an Ai with [formula]. We know that ai is contained in [formula], but not in G1. From the fact that [formula] is U-small we can conclude that ai∈U(x). On the other hand, if G' is an element of G, then Ai cannot be contained in G' since [formula]. Choose an [formula]. Both x and a' are elements of the complement of G1, so x∈U(a').

QH-singularity

We shall start this section with a result that, given a quasi-uniform space (X,U), allows us to construct a quasi-uniformity that is strictly larger than, but still QH-equivalent to U. We will use this result to discuss the cofinallity of proximally well-monotone covers on QH-singular spaces.

Let (X,U) be a uniformly connected quasi-uniform space. If there exists a proximally well-monotone cover G of X with the property that for each U∈U there is a G∈G such that [formula] is U-[formula]-totally bounded, then (X,U) is not QH-singular.

Suppose that there is a proximally well-monotone cover G of X with the property that is stated in the proposition. We saw earlier on that we can find a sequence (Gn)n of proximally well-monotone covers such that (UGn)n is a normal sequence for UG. Looking at the construction of this normal sequence (see proposition [\ref=normalentourage]) we see that each Gn contains G. This means that each Gn satisfies the conditions stated in proposition [\ref=boundedhaus]. Let U* be the quasi-uniformity generated by the entourages [formula] with V∈U.

From proposition [\ref=boundedhaus] we obtain that each of the entourages [formula] is an element of UH. Because UH is clearly a subset of (U*)H we can conclude that both quasi-uniformities are in fact equal. This means that U and U* are QH-equivalent.

We will now prove that U and U* are distinct unformities by showing that UG cannot be an element of U. Let us assume that UG is in fact an entourage in the quasi-uniformity U. If this is the case, then we can find a V∈U such that V(x)  ⊆  UG(x) for each x∈X. This implies that V(G)  ⊆  UG(G)  ⊆  G+ for each G∈G. Choose G∈G such that [formula] is V-[formula]-totally bounded. This means that we can write the complement of G as the union of a collection (Ai)i∈I where each Ai is V-small and [formula]. Choose an ai∈Ai for each i∈I and let Gi be an element of G with the property ai∈Gi. Because (Gi)i∈I cannot be cofinal we know that there is a G' that is larger than each Gi. Since each Gi is larger than G the same must be true for G'. Take an arbitrary element x in the complement of G'. There is an i∈I such that x∈Ai. This yields that x∈V(ai) and thus that x∈V(G')  ⊆  (G')+. This means that each element in the complement of G' is contained in (G')+. Since G' is by definition a subset of (G')+ we obtain that (G')+ is equal to X. This is impossible since we assumed a proximally well-monotone family to not have a maximal element. Hence we can say that UG is no element of U and that U is not QH-singular.

For a quasi-uniform space (X,U) we will define [formula] as the minimal cardinal α for which (X,U) is α- bounded. The first result that we can derive from proposition [\ref=singular] is that this cardinal number is in fact a strict upper bound for the cofinality of proximally well-monotone covers on a QH-singular quasi-uniform space (X,U).

Let (X,U) be a uniformly connected, QH-singular quasi-uniform space. If G is a proximally well-monotone cover, then [formula].

Suppose that G is a proximally well-monotone cover with the property that [formula] is at least [formula]. Since [formula] is [formula]-bounded for each G∈G we obtain that G satisfies the properties stated in proposition [\ref=singular]. This would imply that (X,U) is not QH-singular.

Let (X,U) be a uniformly connected, totally bounded quasi-uniform space. If (X,U) is QH-singular and we have a ≪  -increasing sequence (Gn)n of sets that covers X, then there is some Gn that is equal to X.

If no Gn is equal to X, then the collection of all sets Gn forms a proximally well-monotone cover by proposition [\ref=countable]. Because both the cofinality of this cover and [formula] are equal to [formula], it would follow from corollary [\ref=boundedness] that (X,U) is not QH-singular.

We will now prove that a quasi-uniform space is QH-singular whenever its symmetrisation is compact.

If UH  =  VH, then τ(Us) = τ(Vs).

If U and V are QH-equivalent, then τ(U) is equal to τ(V) and τ(U- 1) is equal to τ(V- 1) (see [\cite=Kunzi]). Because the topologies τ(Us) and τ(Vs) are respectively equal to [formula] and [formula] we obtain that τ(Us) and τ(Vs) coincide.

If τ(Us) is compact and UH  =  VH, then V  ⊆  U.

Take a V∈V and choose W∈V such that W2  ⊆  V. Because UH  =  VH we know that τ(U) = τ(V). This means that we can take for each x∈X a Ux∈U such that U2x(x)  ⊆  W(x). Because W- 1(x) is a neighbourhood of x in τ(V- 1) and thus in τ(U- 1) we know that [formula] is a τ(Us)-neighbourhood of x. Since τ(Us) is compact we can find [formula] such that

[formula]

Define U as [formula]. Let x be an arbitrary element of X and take a z∈U(x). Assume that x is an element of [formula] for some 0  ≤  k  ≤  n. This implies that z is an element of U(Uxk(xk)) and thus of W(xk). Because xk∈W(x) we have that z∈W2(x)  ⊆  V(x). This means that U(x)  ⊆  V(x) and, because x was arbitrary, that U  ⊆  V.

If τ(Us) is compact, then U is QH-singular.

Suppose that there is a quasi-uniformity V such that UH  =  VH. From the previous proposition we obtain that V  ⊆  U. Proposition [\ref=uniformcoreflection] yields that τ(Vs) is compact. Using the previous proposition once more, we get that U  ⊆  V.

Using the results that we have obtained so far we can give a complete characterisation of QH-singularity for totally bounded, quasi-metric spaces.

Let (X,q) be a uniformly connected quasi-metric space and Y a non-empty subset of X. If there is an [formula] in the q- 1-closure of Y with a totally bounded q- 1-neighbourghood, then the subspace Y is not QH-singular.

Choose ε > 0 such that the q- 1-ball with center x and radius ε is totally bounded and does not cover the entire subset Y. Define Gn  ⊆  Y as the subset {y∈Y  |  q(y,x) > n- 1ε}. It is clear that this is a ≪  -increasing sequence of non-empty sets and, since x is an element of [formula] that is contained in the q- 1- closure of Y, it is a cover of Y that does not contain the set Y itself. It follows from corollary [\ref=countablesingular] that Y is not QH-singular.

Let (X,q) be a uniformly connected, totally bounded quasi-metric space. The space (X,q) is QH-singular iff (X,qs) is compact.

That this condition is sufficient was established in corollary [\ref=symmcompact]. Now assume that (X,q) is totally bounded and QH-singular, but that (X,qs) fails to be compact. Since (X,qs) is a totally bounded metric space we know that (X,qs) is not complete. Let (,) be the bicompletion of (X,q) and take an [formula]. It is well known (see [\cite=Brummer]) that the symmetrisation of the bicompletion of a quasi-uniform space is equal to the completion of the symmetrisation of that space. Because the completion of a totally bounded uniform space is again totally bounded this implies that (,) is totally bounded. Hence we have that [formula] is a totally bounded q- 1-neighbourhood of x0. From the fact that X is s-dense in [formula] we obtain that x0 is an element of the - 1-closure of X. It follows from proposition [\ref=dense] that (X,q) cannot be QH-singular and thus we know that (X,qs) must be compact.
