The Weighted AM-GM Inequality is Equivalent to the Hölder Inequality

Introduction

In field of classical analysis, the weighted AM-GM inequality (see e.g. [\cite=ZCIT]) is often inferred from the Jensen inequality, which is a more generalized inequality than AM-GM inequality, refer to [\cite=GJG34] [\cite=RJR09] [\cite=ZCIT] and references therein. In addition, the well-known Hölder inequality [\cite=GJG34], found by Rogers (1888) and discovered independently by Otto Hölder (1889), is a basic inequality between integrals and an indispensable tool for the study of Lp space, and is a extension form of Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality [\cite=SSDA], Hölder inequality is used to prove the Minkowski inequality, which is the triangle inequality (refer to [\cite=DJA93] [\cite=EFR61] [\cite=DS70] [\cite=XMGTZH]). Weighted power means (also known as generalized means) Mmr(a) for a sequence [formula] is defined as [formula], which are a family of functions for aggregating sets of number, and plays a vital role in mathematical inequalities (see [\cite=SBJ97] [\cite=JFY92] [\cite=GJG34] for instance).

On the other hand, many researchers are interested in investigating the mathematical equivalence among some famous analytical inequalities, such as Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Bernoulli inequality, Wielandt inequality, and Minkowski inequality; see [\cite=FFNT97] [\cite=LS06] [\cite=Ma01] [\cite=Ma12] [\cite=Zh01] [\cite=AIB11] [\cite=SMSG] for the discussion of these issues. Motivated by these earlier mentioned pioneer work, in the present paper, the mathematical equivalence among these three well-known inequalities (i.e., Weighted AM-GM inequality, Hölder inequality, and Weighted power-mean inequality) is proved in detail, a generalization of a result in [\cite=Lin12] is drawn.

The reminder of the present note is organized as follows. In the next section, we will give the detailed proofs of mathematical equivalence among three well-known mathematical inequalities. Finally, we end the paper with a few concluding remarks in Section [\ref=sec2].

main results

Firstly, we will briefly review definitions of Weighted AM-GM inequality, Hölder inequality, and Weighted power-mean inequality. Then the main results of mathematical equivalence among these three well-known inequalities will be shown.

Weighted AM-GM Inequality. If [formula] are nonnegative real numbers, λ1, [formula] are nonnegative real numbers such that [formula], then

[formula]

Hölder Inequality. If [formula] are nonnegative real numbers, p and q are positive real numbers such that p- 1 + q- 1=1, p > 1, then

[formula]

Weighted Power-Mean Inequality. [\cite=ZCIT] If [formula] are nonnegative real numbers such that [formula], r and s are positive real numbers such that r  ≤  s, then

[formula]

The word "equivalence" between two statements [formula] and [formula], by convention, is understood as [formula] implies [formula] and [formula] implies [formula]. Two true statements are equivalent. Thus the note just reveals a connection (in the sense of art) between these two well known facts.

The Hölder inequality is equivalent to the Weighted AM-GM inequality.

To show ([\ref=e2]) implies ([\ref=e1]), we let [formula] in ([\ref=e2]) for all k, then

[formula]

Since p- 1 + q- 1=1 and [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Now using inequality ([\ref=e4]) successively, we obtain

[formula]

By L'Hospital's rule, it is easy to see that

[formula]

So

[formula]

Thus in ([\ref=e5]), we can pass to the limit m  →    +    ∞  , giving [formula]; hence ([\ref=e2]) implies ([\ref=e1]). To show the converse, we only need a special case of ([\ref=e1]),

[formula]

Since p- 1 + q- 1=1, and by ([\ref=e6]), we have

[formula]

For [formula]. Summing over k, we obtain

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=e2]) follows.

The Hölder inequality is equivalent to the Weighted power-mean inequality.

From Theorem [\ref=the1] and according to inequality ([\ref=e2]), we can obtain

[formula]

For r < s, we can let [formula] and xk = csk in ([\ref=e7]) for all k, so

[formula]

Thus, rewriting the above inequality ([\ref=e7x]) as the following.

[formula]

Now our task is to prove the converse, by inequality ([\ref=e3]), we have

[formula]

By L'Hospital's rule, it is easy to see that

[formula]

By using analogous methods from Theorem [\ref=the1], we can prove

[formula]

The Weighted power-mean inequality is equivalent to the Weighted AM-GM inequality.

To show ([\ref=e1]) implies ([\ref=e3]), we merely use a special case of ([\ref=e1]),

[formula]

Firstly, we denote [formula], letting a1  =  λkask(Un(a))- 1,a2  =  λk and [formula] in ([\ref=e10]), then

[formula]

For [formula]. Summing over k, we obtain

[formula]

So

[formula]

The converse is trivial from Theorem [\ref=the2].
