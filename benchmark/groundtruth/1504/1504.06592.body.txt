On the MacPhersonian

In 2003 Daniel K. Biss published, in the Annals of Mathematics [\cite=Biss], what he thought was a solution of a long standing problem culminating a discovery by Gelfand and MacPherson [\cite=GM]. Six years later he was encouraged to publish an "erratum" of his prove [\cite=Biss2], observed by Nikolai Mnëv; up to now, the homotopy type of the MacPhersonian had remained a mistery...

The aim of this lecture is to convince the attendee of the fact that, using a compleatly different aproach to those used before, we can prove that the (acyclic) MacPhersonian has the homotopy type of the (affine) Grassmannian.

Preliminaries

An oriented matroid M = (E,C) consists of a set E and a symmetric relation on its disjoin pairs of subsets [formula], called the circuits, which encodes the so-called minimal Radon partitions of the matroid; if a pair of subsets, A and B, form a circuit, then we denote this fact by [formula] (cf. [\cite=NS]).

The basic example of an oriented matroid is a family of points in Euclidian d-space E  ⊂  I Rd; its circuits are the minimal (affine) dependences, encoded as Radon partitions, i.e.,

[formula]

However, oriented matroids are a bit more general than that, and there are much more oriented matroids than configurations of points. Indeed, to decide if an oriented matroid is representable with points is an NP-hard problem (see [\cite=Shor]).

The Grassmannian Gdn

Given n points [formula] in dimension d, we can build an d  ×  n matrix M = (pi) consisting of these n column vectors. This matrix is naturally identified with the linear map which sends the cannonical base of I Rn onto the points, and two such functions M,M' are affinely equivalent if, and only if, their respective kernels KM,KM' intersect the hyperplane

[formula]

in exactly the same plane (cf. [\cite=MS1]): [formula].

If the points span the d-dimentional space, the kernel of such a function is of dimention n - d, and we can identify the configuration with the n - d - 1 subspace of the hyperplane [formula]; thus, we can identify each configuration with a point of the Grassmannian Gdn which consists of all n - d - 1 planes of I Rn - 1, with the natural topology.

Furthermore, the intersection of each such a n - d - 1 plane [formula] with the n-octahedron

[formula]

the convex hull of the cannonical base of I Rn and its negatives, define the so-called Radon complex, a CW-complex which is an (n - d - 2)-sphere (see [\cite=MS1]), whose 1-skeleton is the so called (co)circuit graph of the corresponding oriented matroid; the cocircuit graphs of oriented oriented matroids where characterised in [\cite=KMS] [\cite=MS2].

Observe that [formula] corresponds to the space of all configurations of n = d + 2 points in dimension d; it is the double cover of Gdd + 2, which is homeomorphic to the d-projective space .

The MacPhersonian Mdn

The family of all oriented matroids on n elements in dimension d can be partially ordered by "specialitation"; viz., we say that M  ≤  M' if every minimal Radon partition of M' is a Radon partition of M. Given such a partial order, we can define a topological space, in the usual way, and in the case of all (acyclic) oriented matroids of n elements in dimention d we get the so-called (acyclic) MacPhersonian Mdn.

For example, consider all oriented matroids arising from 4 points in the affine plane: there are essentially 3 labeled configurations in general position with the four points in the boundary of the convex hull, and 4 configurations where one of them is in the interior of the convex hull of the other three. These 7 uniform oriented matroids can be represented by 3 squares and 4 triangles that, when joining them together, form the hemicubooctahedron... this is exactly [formula] after identifing antipodes; that is to say that M24  =  G24.

Stretching spheres

The main idea to better understand the MacPhersonian, is to identify each oriented matroid with its set of circuits. They are encoded in the vertices of the circuit graph, which is well know to be the 1-skeleton of a PL-sphere; indeed, we start with such a "wiggly" sphere and applying to it a Ricci-type flow to stretch it ending up with a configuration of points. This way, we can assign to each oriented matroid a configuration of points, and in such a way that we are defining a homotopical retraction from the MacPhersonian to the Grassmannian.

Oriented Matroids as spheres inside Gn - 2n.

In [\cite=MS2] we characterised the circuit graphs G(M) of oriented matroids as some graphs which can be embeded in what we called there "the k-dual of the n-cube"; that was to say that its vertices can be labeled with the faces of

[formula]

We will identify such circuits (and the corresponding vertices in the circuit graph) with the baricentre of such faces. The vertices of Gn - 2n are points of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and ei in an element of the canonical base of I Rn; and each face of it can be determines in terms of teh convex hull of the vertices that it contain. Therefore, each circuit [formula] of a given oriented matroid M can (and will) be coordinatised in terms of differences of the canonical base vectors of I Rn:

[formula]

If we "fill up the faces" of the circuit graph, considering all its vectors, we end up with a PL-complex which is well known to be an sphere of dimension n - d - 2; that is, we can identify each oriented matroid on n elements in dimension d with a, not necesarly "flat", (n - d - 2)-sphere inside Gn - 2n. An oriented matroid M is stretchable if and only if there is a flat (n - d - 2)-sphere inside Gn - 2n whose 1-skeleton is the circuit graph G(M) (cf., [\cite=MS1]).

The "fat" MacPhersonian Sdn

We now consider a space which is much more "fatty" than the MacPhersonian and the Grassmannian, but contains both of them:

[formula]

That is, we take several copies of each sphere representing an oriented matroid, while considering all possible embeddings of such a sphere inside its natural ambiance space Gn - 2n, with the extra freedom of having its vertices in any point representig the corresponding circuit (not only the baricentre of it).

Clearly, by definition, Sdn and Mdn have the same homotopy type, and Gdn is embedded in Sdn as it is in Mdn; we have the following diagram:

It remains to show that Gdn is a homotopical retract of Sdn.

Combinatorial Curvature Flow on Gn - 2n

Let S∈Sdn be an element of the "fat" MacPhersonian, a "wiggly" PL-sphere of diemnsion n - d - 2 whose vertices lie on the faces of Gn - 2n of dimension at most d. Each vertex v∈S represents a circuit [formula] of an oriented matroid M = (E,C), [formula], and the local curvature of S at v will be modeled as a function which depends only on the neighbourhood [formula] in sk1(S)  =  G(M), the 1-skeleton of the complex which is the circuit graph of the oriented matroid.

It is well known that the order of N(v) is even, and each vertex vi∈N(v) can be related to its "opposite" vertex v'i (cf., [\cite=KMS]); furthermore, the edges of G(M) can be partitioned in disjoin cycles, and whenever one of such a cycles contains v, it also contains a pair of opposite vertices in its neighbourhood. The aim of this section is to exhibit a flow to "stretch" all such cycles to become flat cycles (i.e., contained each in a 2-flat).

For, let ui and u'i be normal vectors to the planes spaned by {v,vi} and {v'i,v}, respectively, and denote by [formula] the angle between these vectors (i.e., θi  =  0 if and only if vi,v,v'i are coplannar vectors with the origin). We use as a local measure of curvature the fuction [formula], where ηi  =   sin θi.

Consider the following system of ODE in I R: for each [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the projection onto the plane spanned by [formula]. Due to the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, this system of Ricci-type ecuations has a solution, for some T > 0, in the interval t∈[0,T]. Furthermore, it can be proved that the curvatures ς(v) tend to zero exponentially fast as the time t goes on. The fixed points of this system are the elements of Gdn and therefore it defines a strong retraction of Sdn onto Gdn.
