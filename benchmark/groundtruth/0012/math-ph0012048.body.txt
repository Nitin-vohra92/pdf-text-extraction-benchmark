On the Ground State of Ferromagnetic Hamiltonians

Introduction

Since the pioneering works on the ferromagnetism by Heisenberg in 1928 [\cite=Heisenberg], Van Vleck [\cite=VanVleck] and others (see [\cite=Mattisbook], page 40 for a brief history) much attention has been paid to the spectrum of the linear operators

[formula]

where [formula] are the spin-[formula] operators at the site [formula] of a finite lattice (i.e. they are three-component vectors of 2  ×  2-matrices) and < i,j >  indicates the summation over all the pairs of nearest-neighbor lattice sites. The properties of the ground state depend strongly on the sign of coupling constants {Jij}. If all Jij < 0, the operator is called antiferromagnetic. In 1962, Lieb, Mattis and Schultz [\cite=Lieb1] [\cite=Lieb2] gave a rigorous proof that in antiferromagnetic case the ground state ψa has total spin S = 0 and is non-degenerate for even number of lattice sites. The detailed structure of ψa can be studied analytically only for one-dimensional lattice with all Jij equal where the model turns out to be solvable and its solution is given by the Bethe Ansatz [\cite=Bethe]. As for the higher dimensions, the structure of ψa can be analyzed by numerical methods only.

For the more transparent ferromagnetic case, all Jij > 0, Mattis [\cite=Mattis] considered as easy to show that the ground state has the maximal spin [formula] and is N + 1 times degenerate the ground states being just state with all spins alligned up and its rotations. However, as to our knowledge we did not see any fully detailed and rigourous proof in the literature we are giving here the proof with clearly formulated assumptions on the lattice of any dimension.

The result and proof

Before the main statement let us show a property of connected graphs which will be used in its proof. Lemma. Let Γ be a connected graph with N  ≥  2 vertices [formula] and edges < i,j >  between some pairs of vertices [formula]. Then there exist two vertices [formula] such that the graphs [formula] and [formula] obtained by removing the vertices i0 or j0 respectively from Γ (together with all edges ending at them of course) are connected. Proof. Let us prove the Lemma by induction with respect to N. The assertion is evidently valid for N = 2,3. Let us now assume that it holds for the graphs with numbers of vertices up to N and that Γ' is a connected graph with N + 1 vertices. Let Γ'' is obtained from Γ' by removing the vertex 1.

If Γ'' is connected then we can remove another two vertices i1,j1 leaving Γ'' connected by induction assumption. If both < 1,i1  >  , < 1,j1  >   are edges of Γ' we can remove 1 and e.g. i1 leaving Γ' connected. If < 1,i1  >   is while < 1,j1  >   is not the edge of Γ' we can remove 1 and j1 leaving Γ' connected. If non of < 1,i1  >  , < 1,j1  >   is the edge of Γ' we can remove any of 1,i1,j1 leaving Γ' connected.

If Γ'' has more than one connected components we can remove two vertices from each one leaving it connected. From them at least one can be chosen such that connection to vertex 1 is not broken. So we can again remove at least two vertices from Γ' leaving it connected. Theorem. Let Γ be a connected graph with N  ≥  2 vertices,

[formula]

where the spin-[formula] operators at the site i are given by Pauli matrices as [formula] for [formula]. Let |ψ  >   be a ground state of the Hamiltonian H. Then

[formula]

and the following statements hold. a)

[formula]

with the total spin [formula], i.e. |ψ  >   is an eigenvector of [formula] with the maximal eigenvalue. b)

[formula]

for any pair [formula] where [formula]. c) There exist complex numbers αk and matrices uk∈SU(2) ([formula]) such that

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the spin-up eigenvector of the third component of one spin (eigenvalue [formula]). In other words, there are no other eigenvectors |ψ  >   satisfying ([\ref=Hpsi0]) then those obtained from [formula] (all spins up) by rotations and linear combinations. Proof. As the possible value of the total momentum of two spins are 0 and 1, the eigenvalues of [formula] are 0 and 1. Therefore for any state |φ  >   of N spins

[formula]

where the equality holds if and only if [formula]. So 0 is the ground state energy of H as we know that really H|ψ0 >  = 0.

Let us further realize that statement b) implies a) by direct calculation

[formula]

The assertion c) follows from a) as the all states satisfying ([\ref=Smax]) can be obtained from |ψ0  >   by rotations and linear combinations and the Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant. To see this, realize that the group SU(2) has an irreducible representation with given eigenvalue of the total spin [formula] and that there is just one state |ψ0  >   with the maximal third component of total spin and therefore just one copy of this irreducible representation.

It remains to prove the assertion b) by induction with respect to N. The assertion holds for N = 2. Let us now assume that the statement b) and consequently also a) holds for some integer number N  ≥  2. Let Γ be now a connected graph with N + 1 vertices, H the corresponding Hamiltonian of the form ([\ref=Hdef]) and |ψ  >   its ground state. By the Lemma, there are two vertices each of which can be removed from Γ without breaking the connectedness. Let us without loss of generality renumber the vertices so that the removable ones will be 1 and N + 1. Taking into account also ([\ref=twospins]) we see that ([\ref=sisj]) holds for any [formula] and any [formula] with [formula]. So only 1   ·   sN  +  1 is under the question. As the total spin [formula] commutes with the Hamiltonian H, we can separate |ψ  >   into the eigenstates of [formula]:

[formula]

Now

[formula]

So |ψS  >   is an eigenvector of 1   ·   sN  +  1. The possible eingenvalues are [formula] and [formula], we show that the second possibility leads to a contradiction. Let us assume

[formula]

then

[formula]

with the possible values [formula] or 0.

If N = 2n is even (n  ≥  1) then [formula] with a non-negative integer k. Substituting into ([\ref=ss34]),

[formula]

Here the product of two integers equals 2 so their values must be ±  1 and ±  2. As the second integer is larger than 2, Equation ([\ref=Neven]) cannot be satisfied.

If N = 2n + 1 is odd (integer n  ≥  1) then S = k is a non-negative integer. Equation ([\ref=ss34]) now reads

[formula]

Here necessarily k > n, so k = n + m, m > 0 which gives

[formula]

However, (m - 1)n  ≥  0 and m(m + 1) > 0 so the equation cannot be satisfied.

Therefore the only possibility is [formula] and then [formula] for [formula]. The statement b) is now proved for N + 1 spins and so it holds for any N by induction. The Theorem is now completely proved.

Concluding remark

We presented here a rigorous proof of the generally accepted essential uniqueness of the ferromagnetic ground state. We assumed that the edges on which the ferromagnetic interaction occurs form a connected graph Γ, no other assumption concerning dimension or topology of the spin site lattice is needed. Typical situation of nearest-neighbors interaction is included as we can always draw a connected path through the all lattice sites formed by the edges between nearest neighbors (except of peculiar cases like two disconnected ferromagnets). On the coupling constants we assume only Jij  ≥  0 for all i,j and Jij > 0 for < i,j >   ⊂  Γ, so they need not be same for the all pairs of spins, in particular, the case of interaction of nearest neighbors of higher orders with weaker couplings is allowed. There are no other assumptions then connectedness on the topology of Γ, in particular, it is irrelevant whether the periodic conditions are required or not for the cubic lattice or the linear chain.
