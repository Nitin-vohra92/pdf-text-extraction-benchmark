The thermohydrodynamical picture of a charged Brownian particle.

We generalize previous work [\cite=bcl], considering a magnetic field [\cite=garba] and a non uniform bath temperature [formula]. Following [\cite=bcl] we write down Kramers equation for the probability distribution [formula] in phase space for the Brownian particle (mass m charge e) under an external force [formula].

[formula]

[formula]

The Fokker-Planck collision time τ is the inverse of the friction coefficient and the thermal velocity vT is given by mv2T = T (hereinafter kB = 1). The diffusion coefficient D and the mobility ξ  =  τ / m are related via the celebrated Einstein relation D = ξT = τv2T. In the collision term J we include a generalized BGK collision mechanism [\cite=bgk]. The latter is characterized by a relaxation time τ0 and a prescribed referential particle density [formula] (for example, as in [\cite=bgk] n0 is the actual Brownian particle density [formula]) and f0 is the normalized equilibrium distribution function

[formula]

The external force (not necessarily uniform) includes a mechanical part [formula], an electric field [formula] and a magnetic field [formula]. Let us define a potential function V = Vmec + eφ and a covariant derivative [formula] [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Also define the vector ω (notice the cyclotron frequency is |ω| = ωc) by [formula]. Thus the external force [formula] is given by [formula]. Generalizing our previous ansatz [\cite=bcl] as

[formula]

where Φnk(wk) are the orthonormal Hermite functions and with [formula]. As before, we require the density of Brownian particles to be [formula]. By direct substitution of the ansatz into equation ([\ref=kkeq]), and as in [\cite=bcl] a set of differential recursive (difference) equations for the [formula] are readily obtained (in [\cite=bcl], the one dimensional case, a continued fraction expansion was obtained, the general case is amenable to a multibranched continued fraction scheme as in [\cite=confrac]). After a partial integration we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

The asymmetric lowering and raising operators [formula], [formula] and the displacement operator [formula] are defined respectively by

[formula]

(similarly for the remaining components A2 and A3). The particle number balance equation (equation ([\ref=recu]) with [formula]) defined here as the generalized Smoluchowsky equation, is given by:

[formula]

with [formula] The passage to hydrodynamics is performed as before [\cite=bcl] defining the particle flux, the charge flux, the pressure tensor and the energy flux, respectively by:

[formula]

We also define the energy density E and the nonequilibrium temperature Θ as before [\cite=bcl]

[formula]

Again from equation ([\ref=recu]), this time with [formula], we derive the balance equation for the charge flux (generalized Ohm law [\cite=nic])

[formula]

where

[formula]

With the additional definitions ε = mnv2T and ε0 = mn0v2T we obtain for the energy flux balance equation (equation ([\ref=recu]), with [formula])

[formula]

We perform the passage to thermodynamics [\cite=bcl] with the definition for the entropy density

[formula]

(where ln en = 1, so in the appropriate limit we retrieve the usual thermodynamical entropy [\cite=bcl]). The entropy flux is defined as [formula] [formula], then the entropy density balance equation is given by

[formula]

where σSis the entropy production Also as in [\cite=bcl] we define the generalized free energy densities F and G, and the intrinsic and total chemical potentials respectively as

[formula]

Here we introduce no a priori assumptions on the functional dependence of the entropy (as in the local equilibrium approach, LEQ) nor do we assume relevant variables as is extended irreversible thermodynamics (EIT, [\cite=jou]). As in [\cite=bcl], all fluxes (including the ones not computed here), Θ, μ, S, in fact all thermodynamic potentials can be expanded in powers of τ (adequate at least in the overdamped limit and with τ0  ≫  τ), formally rendering all variables universal functions of the set [formula]. Thus, at any given τ expansion stage, the only relevant variables are n and T. For Brownian motion, the universal equation for the particle density is the generalized Smoluchowsky equation plus a set of boundary conditions (BC). This picture is distinct but not inconsistent with EIT [\cite=jou], where incorporating the BC to the fluxes, the latter may be interpreted as relevant variables. LEQ is satisfied only to first order in τ, where

[formula]

For the linear (first order in τ) case and a stationary (time independent) temperature T = Θ, the particle and heat fluxes are cast as (with [formula])

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

with θ = DDB- 1 and where Bohm's diffusion coefficient is DB = cT(eB)- 1. Notice that θ  =  σ0BRH  =  τωc where σ0 = m- 1e2τn.

The scope of the Brownian motion scheme is highlighted with some direct applications of equation ([\ref=flux]):

a)If diffusion is disregarded ([formula], say electrons in a metal) and with [formula] we retrieve the classical magnetoresistance and Hall effect models [\cite=mermin];

b) If we consider two Brownian gases, say electrons and holes (inhomogeneous semiconductors), with the n0's the equilibrium carriers' densities and the τ0's generation-recombination times, then ([\ref=smolu]) together with ([\ref=flux]) constitute generalized transport equations [\cite=mermin];

c)The diffusive part has the 'correct Fick law' for nonuniform temperature [\cite=van];

d) Equation ([\ref=flux]) can also de cast as

[formula]

in agreement with [\cite=landauer] for the [formula] case, suggesting that diffusive mass transport is solely convective transport of both mass and entropy; and finally

e)In the high magnetic field regime and with [formula] the cross diffusion current is driven by DB  ~  B- 1 the anomalous Bohm coefficient, never derived but proposed to explain the observed B- 1 behavior instead of the expected B- 2 term [\cite=chen].

f)Onsager's reciprocal relations are retrieved from equations ([\ref=flux]) and ([\ref=eflux]) only in the small magnetic field regime, with  αq  ≈  q (see equation ([\ref=onsag]).

Results up to τ2 (lowest non linear regime) are presented only for the uniform case [formula] Define the magneto-covariant derivative [formula] Then the particle and energy fluxes are given respectively by

[formula]

The nonequilibrium temperature is cast as

[formula]

the nonequilibrium entropy, chemical potential and entropy production are given respectively by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(the latter for the case τ0  =    ∞  ). The universal (Smoluchowsky) equation for the nonequilibrium density is

[formula]

Work in progress includes illuminated systems [\cite=solar], chemical reactions [\cite=tania], the non linear regime in earnest, transport and entropy production general properties, and the validity of any Onsager-like scheme.
