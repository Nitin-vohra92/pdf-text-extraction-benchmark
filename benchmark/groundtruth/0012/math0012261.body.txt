Eigenvalues of the Dirac Operator on Manifolds with Boundary

Introduction

It is well known that the spectrum of the Dirac operator on closed spin manifolds detects subtle information on the geometry and the topology of such manifolds (see for example [\cite=BFGK] [\cite=BHMM]).

In [\cite=HZ1], basic properties of the hypersurface Dirac operator are established. This hypersurface Dirac operator appears as the boundary term in the integral Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula ([\ref=ili]) for compact spin manifolds with compact boundary. In fact, the hypersurface Dirac operator is, up to a zero order operator, the intrinsic Dirac operator of the boundary.

In this paper, we examine the classical local boundary conditions and certain Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions for the Dirac operator. Here, the spectral resolution of the intrinsic Dirac operator of the boundary is used to define the APS boundary conditions. We first prove self-adjointness and ellipticity of such conditions.

Then, systematic use of the modified Levi-Cività connections, introduced in [\cite=Fr] [\cite=Hi3] [\cite=Zh1] [\cite=FK] [\cite=HZ1], is made. Under appropriate curvature assumptions, these modified connections combined with formula ([\ref=ili]), yield to the corresponding estimates for compact spin manifolds with boundary. The limiting cases are then studied.

Such estimates are obtained in Sections [\ref=lb] and [\ref=clb]. In Section [\ref=lb] we consider both the local and the above mentioned APS boundary conditions. We first introduce the modified connection ([\ref=gcm]) which allows to establish a Friedrich's type inequality, in case the mean curvature of the boundary is nonnegative. Under the local boundary conditions, the limiting case is then charaterized by the existence of a Killing spinor on the compact manifold with minimal boundary (see ([\ref=est1])). Then the energy-momentum tensor is used to define the modified connection ([\ref=emtm]), from which one can deduce inequality ([\ref=est2]).

Finally, in section [\ref=clb], under the local boundary conditions, the conformal aspect is examined. For example, generalizations of the conformal lower bounds in [\cite=Hi1] [\cite=Hi3] are obtained (see Remark [\ref=Hi1Hi3]).

The elliptic boundary conditions

Let M be an n-dimensional Riemannian spin manifold with boundary ∂M endowed with its induced Riemannian and spin structures. Denote by [formula] the spinor bundle of M. Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) be the Levi-Cività connection of M (resp. ∂M) and denote by the same symbol their corresponding lift to the spinor bundle [formula]. Consider the Dirac operator D of M defined by [formula] on [formula]. It is known [\cite=LM] that there exists a positive definite Hermitian metric on [formula] which satisfies, for any covector field X*∈Γ(T*M), and any spinor fields [formula], the relation

[formula]

where "·  " denotes Clifford multiplication. The connection [formula] is compatible with the metric (  ,  ). Fix a point p∈∂M and an orthonormal basis {eα} of TpM with e0 the outward normal to ∂M and ei tangent to ∂M such that for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n

[formula]

Let {eα} be the dual coframe. Then, for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n

[formula]

where hij = [formula] are the components of the second fundamental form at p, and we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the mean curvature of M. In the above notation, the standard sphere Snr  =  ∂Bn + 1r has positive mean curvature [formula]. By ([\ref=ip]), (e0  ·  ej  ·  φ,ψ) = (φ,ej  ·  e0  ·  ψ). Therefore ([\ref=rtc2]) implies

[formula]

Hence the connection [formula] is also compatible with the metric (  ,  ). Denote by D∂M the Dirac operator of ∂M. In the above orthonormal coframe {ei} of M, [formula]. Thus D∂M is self-adjoint with respect to the metric (  ,  ). The relation ([\ref=rtc2]) implies that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Consider the integral form of the Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula for a compact manifold with compact boundary

[formula]

It is well-known that there are basically two types of elliptic boundary conditions for the Dirac operator: The local boundary condition and the (global) Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) boundary condition. Such boundary conditions are used in the positive mass theorem for black holes, Penrose conjecture in general relativity and the index theory in topology [\cite=GHHP] [\cite=G] [\cite=He1] [\cite=He2] [\cite=Zh2]. The APS boundary condition exists on any spin manifold with boundary, while the local boundary condition requires certain additional structures on manifolds such as the existence of a Lorentzian structure or a chirality operator, etc [\cite=FS] [\cite=GHHP] [\cite=He2]. Now we shall show that the local boundary condition exists on certain spin manifolds with a "boundary chirality operator".

An operator Γ defined on [formula] is said to be a boundary chirality operator if it satisfies the following conditions:

[formula]

If M is a spacelike hypersurface of a spacetime manifold with timelike covector T, then we can let Γ  =  T  ·  e0, where e0 is the normal covector on ∂M.

Recall that (see [\cite=FS] for example), an operator F defined on [formula] is called a chirality operator on M if for all X*∈Γ(T*M), and any spinor fields [formula], one has

[formula]

Note that, such an operator exists if the spin manifold M is even dimensional. It is easy to see that if M has a chirality operator F, then Γ  =  F|∂M  ·  e0 is a boundary chirality operator. But, in general, it is not known whether the local boundary condition exists. In this paper, we consider the following boundary conditions:

The local boundary condition: As the eigenvalues of the chirality operator Γ are ±  1, the corresponding eigenspaces

[formula]

provide local boundary conditions.

The APS type boundary condition: The operator e0  ·  D∂M is self-adjoint with respect to the induced metric (    ,    ) on ∂M. Therefore it has a discrete (real) spectrum. Let [formula] be the spectral resolution of e0  ·  D∂M, i.e., e0  ·  D∂Mφk  =  λkφk, and consider the corresponding L2-orthogonal subspaces ΓAPS± spanned by the positive and negative eigenspaces of [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

We will consider the APS type boundary conditions corresponding to the projections onto these subspaces. Recall that the original Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) boundary condition refers to the spectral resolution of e0  ·  D∂M - H / 2 instead of [formula] (see for example [\cite=FS]).

Note that if φ,ψ∈Γloc±, then

[formula]

hence (e0  ·  φ,ψ) = 0. On the other hand, if φ,ψ∈ΓAPS±, then e0  ·  φ∈ΓAPS∓, therefore

[formula]

These facts imply that the Dirac operator D is self-adjoint under either the local boundary conditions or the APS boundary negative and positive conditions. Morevoer, it has real eigenvalues. Now we define the Hk Sobolev norm by

[formula]

where α is a multi-index.

Under the local boundary condition φ∈Γloc± or the APS boundary condition φ∈ΓAPS-, the Dirac operator D satisfies elliptic estimates: For any k  ≥  1, δ > 0, there exists Ck,δ such that

[formula]

Proof : Note that for any φ∈Γloc+ or φ∈Γloc-, D∂M(Γ  ·  φ)  =  Γ  ·  D∂Mφ, thus

[formula]

Therefore (φ,e0  ·  D∂Mφ) = 0. If φ∈ΓAPS-, then

[formula]

By the Ehrling-Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality [\cite=A], for each ε > 0, there exists a constant [formula] such that

[formula]

thus ([\ref=ili]) implies

[formula]

Then a standard argument gives ([\ref=heloc]).

The following corollary is a direct consequence of the Sobolev embedding theorem

[formula]

Any eigenspinor of the Dirac operator which satisfies either the local boundary condition φ∈Γloc± or the (negative) APS boundary condition φ∈ΓAPS- is smooth.

In this section, we adapt the arguments used in [\cite=HZ1] to the case of spin compact manifolds with boundary. In particular, we get generalizations of basic inequalities on the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator D under the local boundary conditions Γloc± or the negative APS boundary condition ΓAPS-. For this, we use the integral identity ([\ref=ili]) together with an appropriate modification of the Levi-Cività connection.

Let Dφ  =  λφ, where λ is a real constant or a real function. For any real functions a and u, we define

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Define the functions Ra,u by

[formula]

where Δ is the positive scalar Laplacian. Then we have

[formula]

Therefore ([\ref=ili]) yields

[formula]

Now we generalize Lemma 2.3 in [\cite=FK] to the case where a is a real function.

Suppose there exist a spinor field [formula], a real number λ and a real functions a and u on M such that for all i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n,

[formula]

Then φ is a real Killing spinor, i.e., either a = 0 or du = 0. In particular, the manifold is Einstein.

Proof : First, observe that ([\ref=ieq1]) implies Dφ  =  λφ. By the Ricci identity (see [\cite=FK]), we have

[formula]

This implies either a = 0 or du = 0.

By ([\ref=eq1]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we obtain

Let Mn be a compact Riemannian spin manifold of dimension n  ≥  2, with boundary ∂M, and let λ be any eigenvalue of D under either the local boundary condition Γloc± or the (negative) APS boundary condition ΓAPS-. If there exist real functions a, u on M such that

[formula]

on ∂M, where H is the mean curvature of ∂M, then

[formula]

where Ra,u is given in ([\ref=Rau]). In the limiting case with the local boundary conditions, the associated eigenspinor is a real Killing spinor and ∂M is minimal.

Note that by [\cite=HMZ], under the APS boundary conditions equality in ([\ref=est1]) could not hold.

Now we make use of the energy-momentum tensor (see [\cite=Hi3]) to get lower bounds for the eigenvalues of D. For any spinor field φ, we define the associated energy momentum 2-tensor Qφ on the complement of its zero set by,

[formula]

If φ is an eigenspinor of D, the tensor Qφ is well-defined in the sense of distribution. Let

[formula]

It is easy to prove that (see [\cite=HZ1])

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Thus we have

Let Mn be a compact Riemannian spin manifold of dimension n  ≥  2, with boundary ∂M, and let λ be any eigenvalue of D under either the local boundary condition Γloc± or the (negative) APS boundary condition ΓAPS-. If there exist real functions a, u on M such that

[formula]

on ∂M, where H is the mean curvature of ∂M, then

[formula]

In the limiting case, one has H  =  2adu(e0) on ∂M.

As in the previous section and under the local boundary conditions Γloc±, we show that the conformal arguments used in [\cite=HZ1] combined with the integral formula ([\ref=ili]) yield to generalizations of all known lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator.

Let g be the metric of M. For any real function u on M, consider a conformal metric   =  e2ug. Denote by [formula] the Dirac operator with respect to this conformal metric. If Dφ  =  λφ, then [formula] where [formula]. Note that

[formula]

also, on ∂M,

[formula]

Define the function R̂a,u by

[formula]

where Δ is the positive scalar Laplacian. Then apply ([\ref=eq1]) to the conformal metric [formula], to get

[formula]

Note that [formula] implies

[formula]

(see [\cite=FK]), we thus have either [formula] or du = 0 by Lemma [\ref=lemma1]. Thus we obtain:

Let Mn be a compact Riemannian spin manifold of dimension n  ≥  2, with boundary ∂M, and let λ be any eigenvalue of D under the local boundary condition Γloc±. If there exist real functions a, u on M such that

[formula]

on ∂M, where H is the mean curvature of ∂M, then

[formula]

where the function R̂a,u is given in ([\ref=HRau]). In the limiting case, the associated eigenspinor is a real Killing spinor and either H = du(e0) or H = 0 on ∂M.

Since [formula] under the conformal transformation [formula], we apply ([\ref=eq2]) to the conformal metric [formula], to get

[formula]

Thus we have

Let Mn be a compact Riemannian spin manifold of dimension n  ≥  2, with boundary ∂M, and let λ be any eigenvalue of D under the local boundary condition Γloc±. If there exist real functions a, u on M such that

[formula]

on ∂M, where H is the mean curvature of ∂M, then

[formula]

In the limiting case one has H  =  (2a - n + 1)  du(e0) on ∂M.
