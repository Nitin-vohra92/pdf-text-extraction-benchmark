Abstract

It is considered how spin-orbit potential of two nucleons is changed when one of them is embedded in nuclear matter. It is emphasized that there appears new type of potential antisymmetric under nucleon spins which is proportional to mass difference between free and embedded nucleons. The longest range behavior of such potential is estimated.

Study of medium effects on nucleon properties is one of hot problems in the modern nuclear physics. A direct means to investigate this problem may be realized in experiments on nucleon quasifree scattering in nuclear matter at 0.5 -- 1 GeV energy scale [\cite=RCNP].

In the present note basing on the Skyrme model we consider trends of modifications in the NN spin-orbit potential when one of interacting nucleons is embedded in nuclear matter (Fig. 1). In this case the nucleon in matter changes its properties (mass, momentum of inertia, mean squared radius, etc.) and it becomes non identical to the free nucleon.

The Skyrme model provides a compact model for baryons considered as topological solitons of meson field. Besides a fact that it takes explicitly into account only meson degrees of freedom the model has deep relation with fundamental theory of strong interaction, QCD.

The main success of the Skyrme model is connected with calculations of free baryon properties [\cite=ANW]. It also explains some important features of the NN interaction in vacuum [\cite=SkyrmeNP]-[\cite=RiskaD].

Properties of a skyrmion in medium were investigated by number of authors (see [\cite=Meissner]-[\cite=RahimovMKY] and references therein). Qualitatively many of such properties can be obtained from simple scaling rules suggested by Brown and Rho [\cite=Brown]: in the chiral limit there is only one dimension value, the pion decay constant Fπ, which is changed in medium as follows

[formula]

Here and later asterisk indicates an observation in medium, ρ denotes nuclear density and ρ0  =  0.16 fm- 3. All dimensional physical quantities are expressed by appropriate power for the [formula] and the scaling rules read [\cite=Meissner]

[formula]

In ([\ref=2]) M is a free skyrmion mass with quantum numbers of the nucleon, I is its momentum of inertia. In turn the pion mass was estimated to be practically independent on the nuclear density [\cite=BMeissner].

For a skyrmion in nuclear matter the profile function is changed [formula]. For simplicity we shall use a phenomenologic ξ-dependence of the profile function basing on the following arguments. One may assume that at distance between the skyrmion centers R  ≪  m- 1π the chiral limit is fulfilled and the modified profile function is determined from scaling low

[formula]

where eS is the Skyrme constant. But at region R  ≫  m- 1π it must obey the Yukawa low and

[formula]

Thus one may accept the following ξ-dependence of the profile function, which reproduces this two asymptotic regimes

[formula]

where a is an adjustable parameter which takes into account difference between nuclei size and size of the nucleon.

Due to the scaling low the problem seems to be similar to that of potential for two independently breathing skyrmions [\cite=KalbE],[\cite=Kob]. Between different important effects of the breathing mode one has to mention that it generate new type of the spin-orbit potential, which is proportional to [formula], where the [formula] and [formula] are spin Pauli matrices of the skyrmions) [\cite=Kob]. From identity of the free nucleons it is obvious that this potential does not contribute to the NN  →  NN transition in vacuum and is realized as spin-orbit transition potential in the NN  →  NN(1440) and so on channels. Here we will discuss how the antisymmetric spin-orbit structure is realized in the NN potential when one of the nucleons is embedded in nuclear matter.

We start from the product approximation [\cite=SkyrmeNP]

[formula]

which is justified when the separation, [formula], between the center of the two skyrmions, [formula] and [formula], exceeds the skyrmion size. The other notations are as follows: [formula] is the space-time coordinate of the soliton field and [formula] and [formula] are the adiabatically rotated "hedgehogs"

[formula]

where [formula] and Ai(t) are 2  ×  2 rotation matrices. Adapting arguments of [\cite=Kob] one gets the following structure of isospin dependent spin-orbit potential

[formula]

The longest range behavior of the potentials V(  ±  )T = 1(R,ξ) comes from the quadratic part of the Skyrme lagrangian

[formula]

where for symmetry we replace [formula]. If both skyrmions are in vacuum the antisymmetric potential V( - ) vanishes. Note that antisymmetric spin-orbit potential also appears for the hyperon-nucleon interaction which is proportional to mass difference between hyperon and nucleon [\cite=deSwart].

When the distance between skyrmions is larger than the skyrmion size the integral in ([\ref=8]) can be divided to two parts in vicinity of each skyrmion

[formula]

For the first integral one may replace [formula] and for the second integral one may replace [formula] (see [\cite=Nyman]) and the expression ([\ref=8]) becomes

[formula]

In ([\ref=11]) one may put approximately

[formula]

and in closed form the V(  ±  )T = 1(R) potentials read

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=13]) gives very simple connection between the isospin-dependent spin-orbit potential for the nucleons in vacuum, VvacT = 1,ls(R), and the potentials V(  ±  )T = 1(R)

[formula]

Numerical calculations show that at not very high density ρ one can neglect in ([\ref=20]) by the ξ-dependence of the potential, VvacT = 1,ls(κ(ξ,R)  ·  R)  ≈  VvacT = 1,ls(R), and the antisymmetric potential comes only from differences between mass and momentum of inertia of the nucleon in medium and in vacuum

[formula]

In Fig. 2 we display the potentials V(  ±  )T = 1(R) obtained from Eq. ([\ref=20]) for the Paris potential [\cite=Paris] with parameters a = 2 and ξ = 0.7. We also compare them with the isospin independent spin-orbital Paris potential VvacT = 1,ls(R) in vacuum.

Of course an antisymmetric spin-orbit potential appears also for the isospin-independent spin-orbit potential. The main reason is the same as for the isospin-dependent potential. Unfortunately even for the free nucleons the Skyrme model gives results for this potential which disagrees qualitatively with results from realistic phenomenological models [\cite=RiskaD]. This is related to the fact that the isospin-independent spin-orbit potential comes from the quartic term in the Skyrme lagrangian which fails to reproduce attractive interaction at low and intermediate distances [\cite=RiskaD]. Thus direct calculation of the antisymmetric spin-orbit potential in the Skyrme model seems to be senseless and we estimate only tendency of this potential from arguments similar to that were used for ([\ref=20.a])

[formula]

where VvacT = 0,ls(R) is isospin-independent spin-orbit NN potential in vacuum.

In summary, the Skyrme model predicts antisymmetric spin-orbit structure for the NN potential, when one of interacting nucleons is embedded in nuclear matter. The main reason for this potential is connected with difference between free and effective mass and momentum of inertia of nucleon. Possible experimental observation of effects connected with this potential may give us a direct answer on a question how strongly nuclear matter changes properties of the nucleon. The author would like to thank Prof. T. Noro for useful discussions which strongly stimulated this work.
