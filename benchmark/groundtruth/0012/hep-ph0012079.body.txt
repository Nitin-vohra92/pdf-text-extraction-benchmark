I. Introduction

One of the basic questions of particle physics is the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Various theoretical insights suggest the extensions from the minimal Higgs sector with one Higgs doublet, for example, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The MSSM predicts the existence of three neutral and two charged Higgs bosons h0, H0, A0 and H±[\cite=MSSM], in which two Higgs doublets must be introduced to provide masses to down- and up-type fermions through the superpotential and to keep the theory free of anomalies. The lightest neutral Higgs boson in the MSSM may be difficult to distinguish from the neutral Higgs boson of the standard model(SM). The exploration of additional Higgs bosons will be then very important to confirm extended Higgs sector. Discovery of a charged Higgs boson, H±, shows directly these extended versions of the Higgs sector. Beyond the discovery of Higgs bosons, reconstructing the Higgs potential will be necessary, and that requires the experimental study of the self-couplings of Higgs bosons.

At the Large Hadron Collider(LHC), searching for these extra Higgs bosons is also one of the most important tasks. In much of the parameter space preferred by the MSSM, namely mH± > mW and 1 <  tan β < mt / mb [\cite=pspace], the LHC will provide several mechanisms to search for charged Higgs boson. A copious source of charged Higgs bosons with fair light mass are decay of top quarks t  →  bH+[\cite=tdecay], since top quarks are produced with very large rates at the LHC. For a heavier charged Higgs boson the dominate production process is gb  →  tH-[\cite=gbth]. The pair charged Higgs bosons can be produced via quark-antiquark annihilation [\cite=qaqa] and gluon-gluon fusion[\cite=pairjy] [\cite=pairk] [\cite=pairb] [\cite=pairh]. Of course, Higgs pair production has a lower rate compared with the single production mechanism, but Higgs pair production via gg and q annihilation involves the trilinear and quartic couplings of the physical Higgs bosons. So the measurement of these couplings will be useful in reconstructing the Higgs potential.

The full MSSM Lagrangian consists of various soft masses and the higgsino μ parameter and has 45 CP-violating complex phases[\cite=cpphase]. In principle, the CP phases may come from the soft SUSY-breaking gaugino masses Ma (a = U(1)Y,SU(2)L,SU(3)C), the soft bilinear Higgs mass mixing masses m212 ( or Bμ), the soft trilinear Yukawa couplings Af and the higgsino mass parameter μ. Assuming universality condition of the soft gaugino masses at the GUT (or Planck) scale, the gaugino masses have a common phase and the different soft trilinear Yukawa coupling are all equal at this scale. Due to the two global U(1) symmetries of the MSSM Lagrangian, the U(1)Q Peccei-Quinn symmetry and the U(1)R symmetry acting on the Grassman-valued coordinates, not all CP phases are physical and the physical CP phases could be reduced to those of trilinear coupling Af and the μ parameter[\cite=gsy], Φμ and ΦAf,

[formula]

The CP phases are constrained indirectly by the measurements of the fermionic electric dipole moment(EDM), mainly of electron EDM de and neutron EDM dn. In order to satisfy the current experimental bounds of electron[\cite=de] and neutron [\cite=dn] EDMs, there are several possibilities to solve it. The first possibility is to let the CP phases very small, i.e.|Φ|  ≤  10- 2 [\cite=smallcp]. The second possibility is that the CP phases are not very small but the first two generations of scalar fermions which contribute to EDMs are heavy[\cite=heavy]. The third possibility is that the partial cancellations among various contributions to the electron and neutron EDM's in a restricted parameter space and the CP phases do not have to be suppressed[\cite=cancellation1] [\cite=can2].

In the Higgs sector of the MSSM, at the tree-level Higgs potential is CP invariant, since the mass parameters of the two Higgs fields and the vacuum expectation values tan β are real and μ enters only via |μ|2. If one includes the radiative corrections involving soft-CP-violating Yukawa interactions in the theory, the tree-level CP invariance of the Higgs potential can be broken[\cite=hcp1] [\cite=hcp2]. It's so called explicit CP violation of the MSSM Higgs potential. Then the three neutral Higgs bosons can mix and none of the mass eigenstate Higgs boson is a CP eigenstate. For |μ| and |Af| values larger than the arithmetic average of the scalar-top-quark masses squared, denoted as MSUSY(M2SUSY = 1 / 2(m2t̃1  +  m2t̃2)), the explicit CP-violating effects can be significant[\cite=hcp1]. If |μ| and |Af| values are smaller than M2SUSY or the CP phases of μ and Af is much small, such CP-violating effects turn out to be negligible.

Various SUSY processes including the effects of the CP phases have recently been considered, such as the effects in the neutral Higgs boson production at hadron collider[\cite=dedes], the effects in neutralino [\cite=neu] and chargino [\cite=cha] production at LEP, at CERN LHC[\cite=mazhou], as well as at future electron-positron linear colliders[\cite=lc]. In this work we shall investigate the CP violation effects in process gg  →  H+H- in the context of the mSUGRA. In the numerical calculation we choose |μ| and |Af| smaller than M2SUSY and the CP phases of μ and Af at the order O(10- 2 - 10- 1) to neglect the effects of the neutral Higgs bosons mixing. While the constrains to the parameters from the measurements of the electron and neutron EDM's are taken into account. We organized the paper as follows. In Section II, the analytical calculations are presented. In section III there are numerical results and discussions and in section IV, a short summary is given.

II. Calculation

The Feynman diagrams contributing to the subprocess gg  →  H+H- and the total cross section of this subprocess can be found in [\cite=pairjy]. The effective Lagrangian for electric dipole interaction of a fermion can be written as

[formula]

At the one-loop level, the contribution in the framework of MSSM to the electron EDM comes from the virtual chargino and neutralino exchanges, for the neutron EDM it is contributed by the virtual chargino, neutralino and gluino exchange. By considering the electric dipole operator, the chromoelectric dipole operator and the purely gluonic six-dimension operator, one found [\cite=cancellation1] that there exist significant regions in the parameter space where cancellations between the gluino and the chargino exchanges reduce the electric and the chromoelectric contributions, and the purely gluonic parts lead to a dramatic lowering of the neutron EDM sometimes below the electron EDM value. In the case of the neutron EDM, the dominant chargino and gluino contributions appear with opposite sign over a large portion of the MSSM parameter space. In general, internal cancellations are more likely among the SUSY contributions to the neutron EDM than they are in the case of the electron. A recent calculation of Chang et al.[\cite=chang] for the Barr-Zee-type[\cite=barr] two-loop contributions to the EDMs, shows that the sbottom contribution is enhanced for a large tan β[\cite=baer]. Therefore, in our analysis we choose suitable parameters and small CP phases to suppress the Barr-Zee-type two-loop contributions. The CKM CP phase in the SM can in principle contribute to the fermionic EDM, such as the electron EDM, but it turns out to be effective at three-loop level so that the contribution is very small.

The mSUGRA is based on N = 1 supergravity grand unified theory, in which supersymmetry can be broken spontaneously via gravitational interactions and the electroweak symmetry is broken via radiative effect [\cite=radiat]. At the GUT scale, the CP-violating mSUGRA can be completely parameterized by just six input parameters, namely, m1 / 2, m0, A0, tan β, Φμ and ΦA0, where m1 / 2, m0 and A0 are the universal gaugino mass, scalar mass and the trilinear soft breaking parameter, Φμ and ΦA0 are the CP phases of μ and the trilinear soft breaking parameter. From these six parameters, all the masses and coupling of the model are determined by the evolution from the GUT scale to the low electroweak scale.

With the cross section of the subprocess, we can easily obtain the total cross section at hadron collider by folding the cross section of gg  →  H+H- with the gluon luminosity

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denote the proton-proton and gluon-gluon c.m.s. energies respectively and [formula] is the gluon luminosity, which is defined as

[formula]

Here we used τ = x1x2, the definitions of x1 and x2 are adopted from Ref.[\cite=jiang]. In our numerical calculation we take the MRST(mode 2) parton distribution function fg(xi,Q2) [\cite=MRST], and ignore the supersymmetric QCD corrections to the parton distribution functions for simplicity. The factorization scale Q was chosen as the average of the final particle masses mH+. The numerical calculation is carried out for the LHC at the energy 14TeV.

In this section, we present some numerical results of the CP effects to total cross section from the full one-loop diagrams involving virtual (s)quarks for the process pp  →  gg + X  →  H+H- + X. The input parameters are chosen as: mt = 173.8 ~ GeV, mZ = 91.187 ~ GeV, mb = 4.5 ~ GeV, sin 2θW = 0.2315, and α  =  1 / 128. We adopt a simple one-loop formula for the running strong coupling constant αs

[formula]

where αs(mZ) = 0.117 and nf is the number of active flavors at energy scale μ. In our numerical calculation to get the low energy scenario from the mSUGRA, the renormalization group equations(RGE's)[\cite=RGE] are run from the weak scale MZ up to the GUT scale, taking all threshold into account. We use two loop RGE's only for the gauge couplings and the one-loop RGE's for the other supersymmetric parameters. The GUT scale boundary conditions are imposed and the RGE's are run back to MZ, again taking threshold into account. The REG's for the gauge and Yukawa couplings, and the diagonal elements of the sfermion masses and gaugino masses are real. The phase of μ does not run because it cancels out in the one loop renormalization group equation of μ, and the magnitude and the phase of Af do evolve[\cite=cancellation1]. The decay widths of the intermediate Higgs bosons are considered at the tree level and these formula can be found in ref.[\cite=hunter].

In order to describe the CP violating effects in the process, we introduce the notation δ defined as

[formula]

where σ0 is the cross section of this process with CP conservation and σCP is the cross section with CP violations. In Fig.1 we present the δ versus CP phases of μ and A0. The input parameters are chosen as m0 = 100 ~ GeV,m1 / 2 = 150 ~ GeV, A0 = 300 ~ GeV, tan β = 4 and the CP phases of μ and A0 run from zero to 0.1π. When the CP phases are set zero, the masses of Higgs bosons are mh0 = 97 ~ GeV, mH0 = 258 ~ GeV, mA0 = 254 ~ GeV and mH+ = 266 ~ GeV and the cross section of this process is 1.2 ~ fb. In our numerical calculation we let Φμ = 0 when ΦA0 runs from zero to 0.1π and vice versa. In this case, the CP phase corrections to the masses of Higgs bosons and squarks are the order of just a few percent. So the CP effects to the process at this case mainly come from the phases in the Higgs-squark-squark couplings. The CP effect of Φμ and ΦA0 to this process increase as the phase becoming larger. The δ is positive for Φμ running in this region and can reach 12% when the Φμ = 0.1π, but for ΦA0, the δ is negative and can reach - 46% when the ΦA0 = 0.1π. From the figure we can see that the effect of ΦA0 is larger than that of Φμ to this process. There is a strong dependence of the production rates of the pair charged Higgs on the complex couplings in such MSSM parameter space.

In Fig.2 we also present the δ versus CP phases of μ and A0. The input parameters are chosen as tan β = 30 and the others are the same as those in Fig.1. When the CP phases are set zero, the masses of Higgs bosons are mh0 = 106 ~ GeV, mH0 = 175 ~ GeV, mA0 = 174 ~ GeV and mH+ = 194 ~ GeV and the cross section of this process is 44 ~ fb. We still let Φμ = 0 when ΦA0 runs from zero to 0.1π and vice versa. In this case, the CP phases corrections to the masses of Higgs bosons and squarks are very small and the CP effects to the process mainly come from the CP phases in the Higgs-squark-squark couplings. The CP effects of Φμ and ΦA0 to this process increase as the phase becoming larger. Both the δ of Φμ and ΦA0 to this process are negative. For Φμ the δ can reach - 5.7% when the Φμ = 0.1π and for ΦAf can reach - 12% when the ΦA0 = 0.1π. The dependence of the production rates on the complex couplings is also obvious.

In this work we calculate the CP-violating effects to the process pp  →  gg + X  →  H+H- + X in the mSUGRA scenario at the LHC collider, by taking into account the experimental bounds of electron and neutron EDMs. The CP violation effects in this process are related to the complex phases of μ and Af in the mSUGRA scenario. We choose small CP phases of these parameters to neglect the mixing of neutral Higgs bosons. In this case the CP effects to the process mainly come from the complex couplings of Higgs-squark-squark. We find a strong dependence of the production rates of the pair charged Higgs boson on the complex couplings in the MSSM parameter space we chosen.
