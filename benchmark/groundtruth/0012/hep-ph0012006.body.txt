Introduction

The experimental investigation of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions offers a unique possibility of studying the properties of strongly interacting matter at the high energy density when the hadronic matter is expected to become deconfined and a gas of asymptotically free quarks and gluons is formed. This is called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), in which the colour interactions between partons are screened owing to collective effects (see, for example, reviews [\cite=muller96] [\cite=lok_rev] [\cite=bass_rev]). It is assumed that the conditions for realizing the quark-hadron phase transition which, according to the current cosmological ideas, occurred during the first few microseconds of the evolution of the Universe, can be attained as a result of the generation of strongly excited matter in heavy ion collisions at accelerators.

In recent years, a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of "hard" probes of QGP - heavy quarkonia, hard hadrons and jets, high mass dimuons - which, not forming a part of the thermalized system, carry information about the early stages of the system evolution. In particular, the predicted suppression of the Ψ-resonances yield due to screening of bound state c pair ("colour dipole") in plasma [\cite=satz86] or dynamical dissociation by semi-hard deconfined gluons [\cite=khar94] is one of the promising signals of QGP formation. Such intriguing phenomenon has been observed in the most central Pb-Pb collisions in the NA50 experiment at CERN-SPS [\cite=na50]: the "anomalously" small rate of Ψ-resonances, which is inconsistent with the conventional model of pre-resonance absorption in cold nuclear matter. Although the interpretation of this phenomenon as a result of the formation of a QGP is quite plausible, some alternative explanations (like charmonia rescattering on comoving hadrons) can not be still fully cancelled [\cite=vogt-psi]. For heavier (b) systems, a similar suppression effect in QGP is expected at higher temperatures than for c, which are can be reached in heavy ion collisions at CERN-LHC collider.

Along with the suppression of heavy quarkonia, one of the processes of interest is the passage through the dense matter of jets of colour-charged partons, pairs of which are created at the very beginning of the collision process (at [formula] fm/c) due to initial hard parton-parton scatterings. Such jets pass through the dense matter formed due to mini-jet production at larger time scales (~  0.1 fm/c), and interact strongly with the constituents in the medium. The inclusive cross section for hard jet production is not sufficient at SPS, but it increases fast with the energy of collided nuclei. Thus these will play important role at RHIC ([formula] GeV) and LHC ([formula] TeV for lead beams).

The challenging arising problem here is the behaviour of "colour charge" (high-pT parton) in a dense QCD-matter environment: medium-induced gluon radiation [\cite=ryskin] [\cite=gyul94] [\cite=baier] [\cite=zakharov] [\cite=urs99] and collisional energy losses due to elastic rescatterings [\cite=bjork82] [\cite=mrow91] [\cite=lokhtin1]. Since the jet rescattering intensity strongly increases with temperature, formation of "hot" QGP at the initial temperature up to T0  ~  1 GeV at LHC [\cite=eskola94] should result in much larger jet energy losses as compared with the "cold" nuclear matter or hadronic gas.

Although the radiative energy losses of a high energy parton have been shown to dominate over the collisional losses by up to an order of magnitude [\cite=gyul94], the angular distribution of both losses is very different [\cite=lokhtin2]. The coherent LPM radiation (for gluons with formation times exceeding the mean free path for scattering in the medium) induces a strong dependence of the jet energy on the jet cone size θ0 [\cite=lokhtin2] [\cite=baier3]. With increasing of hard parton energy the maximum of the angular distribution of bremsstrahlung gluons has shift towards the parent parton direction. This means that measuring the jet energy as a sum of the energies of final hadrons moving inside an angular cone with a given finite size θ0 will allow the bulk of the gluon radiation to belong to the jet. On the other hand, the collisional energy loss turns out to be practically independent on θ0 and emerges outside the narrow jet cone, and the relative contribution of collisional losses would likely become significant for jets with finite cone size [\cite=lokhtin2].

Hard jet production at LHC

It is well established now, that A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) [\cite=alice] will be specially dedicated to the heavy ion physics at LHC. Besides, the general purpose detector Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) [\cite=cms], which is optimized mainly for the search of the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions, will be able to perform the accurate measurement of the characteristics of high-energy muons, photons, electrons, and hadronic jets, making it useful also for studying hard probes of the QGP in heavy ion collisions [\cite=note00-060].

Let us consider an example, which demonstrates the sensitivity of jet production pattern to the medium-induced parton rescattering and energy losses: distribution of high-pT jet pair over the impact parameter b of nucleus-nucleus collision [\cite=lokhtin3]. The intriguing prediction associated with the coherence pattern of the medium-induced radiation is that radiative energy losses per unit distance dE / dx depend on the total distance traversed L, asymptotically [formula] [\cite=baier]. Experimentally, the dependence of energy losses of the distance traversed can be studied in different bins of impact parameter b: the average effective transverse size of dense zone [formula] decreases almost linearly with increasing b [\cite=lokhtin3].

The details of the geometrical model for jet production and jet passing through a dense matter, created in nuclear overlapping zone, can be found in our recent work [\cite=lokhtin3]. In general, the intensity of rescattering and energy losses are sensitive to the initial parameters (energy density ε0, formation time τ0) and space-time evolution of a matter. We treat here the medium as a longitudinally expanding quark-gluon fluid, and partons as being produced on a hyper-surface of equal proper times [formula] [\cite=bjorken]. The total energy losses in transverse direction are the result of averaging over the whole "nuclear geometry" (i.e. jet production vertices and azimuthal angles) at given b [\cite=lokhtin3]:

[formula]

Here τ0 and τL are the proper time of the plasma formation and the time of jet escaping from the dense zone respectively; [formula] is the density of plasma constituents of type b at temperature T; σab is the integral cross section of scattering of the jet parton a off the comoving constituent b (with the same longitudinal rapidity y); ν and dE  /  dxrad are the thermal-averaged collisional energy loss of a jet parton due to single elastic scattering and radiative energy losses per unit distance respectively. The formulas for collisional and radiative losses can be found in [\cite=lokhtin3] (see also references therein). Let us just to mark the following essential difference between collisional and radiative losses behaviour.

The collisional loss per scattering ν is independent of total distance traversed and determined by temperature, roughly [formula]. Then total collisional energy losses integrated over whole jet path are estimated as [formula]. The τL-dependence of ΔEcol can be weaker than linear for expanding medium ([formula] for static matter). On the other hand, for medium-induced coherent gluon radiation in the limit of "strong" LPM effect, ω  ≫  μ2Dλg (ω, μD and λg are the energy of radiated gluon, Debye screening mass and gluon mean free path in the medium respectively), we have [\cite=baier] [\cite=baier3] [formula] and [formula] with logarithmic accuracy. Then total radiative energy losses [formula] are estimated as [formula] and [formula] ([formula]).

In our calculations we used the well-known scaling Bjorken's solution [\cite=bjorken] for QGP density: ~  ε(τ)τ4 / 3  =  ε0τ4 / 30, ~ T(τ)τ1 / 3  =  T0τ1 / 30, ~ ρ(τ)τ  =  ρ0τ0. For certainty we used the initial conditions for the gluon-dominated plasma (Nf  ≈  0, ρq  ≈  1.95T3) expected for central Pb - Pb collisions at LHC [\cite=eskola94]: τ0≃0.1 fm/c, T0≃1 GeV. Note that initial energy density ε0 in dense zone depends on b very slightly ([formula]) up to b  ~  RA [\cite=lokhtin3]. Thus the variation of impact parameter b of nuclear collision (which can be measured using the total transverse energy deposition in calorimeters) up to b  ~  RA allows one to study jet quenching as a function of distance traversed without sufficient changing ε0.

The rate of {ij} type dijets with transverse momenta pT1,pT2 produced in initial hard scatterings in AA collisions at given b is obtained by averaging over "nuclear geometry":

[formula]

where dσij  /  dp2T is the parton differential pQCD cross section. The integrated above threshold pcutT dijet rate in AA relative to pp collisions can be studied at LHC with a reference process, unaffected by energy loss and with a production cross section proportional to the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions, such as Z(  →  μ+μ-) production [\cite=note00-060]. The cross section d2σ0jet  /  d2b for initially produced jets in AA collisions at given b is [\cite=note00-060]:

[formula]

where TAA(b) is the nuclear overlap function; σjetNN and σinNN are the computed with PYTHIA5_7 model [\cite=pythia] NN hard scattering cross section and total inelastic cross section respectively.

Figure 1 shows dijet rates (EjetT  >  100 GeV, CMS rapidity acceptance |yjet|  <  2.5) in different impact parameter bins for three cases: (1) without energy losses, (2) with collisional losses only (θ0  ≫  0), (3) with collisional and radiative losses (θ0  →  0). The rates are normalized to the expected number of events produced in Pb-Pb collisions during two weeks (1.2  ×  106 s) of LHC run time, assuming luminosity L  =  1027 ~ cm- 2s- 1 [\cite=cms]. The total initial dijet rate with EjetT  >  100 GeV is estimated as 1.1  ×  107 events. Since the jet quenching is much stronger in central collisions than in peripheral one's, the maximum and mean values of dNdijet / db distribution get shifted towards the larger b as compared to what is expected from independent nucleon-nucleon interactions pattern.

High mass dimuon production at LHC

Let us consider now the high invariant mass ([formula] GeV/c2) dimuon production. One of the main dimuon sources in this "resonances-free" mass region is the semileptonic B-meson decays, which are expected to be sensitive to the rescattering of massive b quarks in dense medium [\cite=dimuons]. The main correlated background, Drell-Yan dimuons, can be rejected using the tracker information on secondary vertex position. The uncorrelated part of dimuon background (random decays of pions and kaons, muon pairs of mixed origin) can be subtracted using like-sign dimuon mass spectra samples [\cite=note00-060].

The correct description of coherent radiation experienced by massive quark is still not solved task. On the one hand, the medium-induced radiation of slow quarks, [formula], should be suppressed by their mass. On the other hand, the ultrarelativistic limit, pT  ≫  Mq, corresponds to the radiation spectrum of massless quark. In our case, the main contribution in the mass region Mμ+μ-  =  20  ÷  50 GeV/c2 is due to b-quarks with "intermediate" values of [formula] GeV/c. We estimated the sensitivity of dimuon spectra to the medium-induced effects for two extremal cases: (1) collisional energy losses only (lower limit); (2) collisional and radiative energy losses without taking into account LPM coherent suppression of radiation, i.e. [formula] and does not depend on L here (upper limit). We performed the Monte-Carlo simulation of mean free path of b-quarks of mass Mb  =  5 GeV/c2 in QGP, formed in nuclear overlapping zone (see the previous chapter). The nuclear shadowing (which is ~  15% in this kinematic region) and transverse momentum kicks obtained by b-quark per rescattering have been taken into account.

Figure 2 presents the μ+μ- invariant mass spectra from b-decays without and with energy losses of b-quarks at CMS muon acceptance: pμT  >  5 GeV/c, |ημ|  <  2.4. The rates are normalized again to the number of events produced in Pb-Pb collisions for two weeks of LHC run time. The total initial dimuon rate at Mμ+μ-  =  20  ÷  50 GeV/c2 is estimated with PYTHIA5_7 and CTEQ2L parton distribution function as 2.8  ×  104, and it can be reduced by factor ~  1.6  ÷  4 due to rescattering and energy losses of b-quarks in QGP. The absolute rates here, of course, depend on the PDF choice, B-meson fragmentation scheme, next-to-leading order corrections, etc. Thus the high mass dimuon spectra measurements with proton or deuterium beams at the same energy per nucleon are requested.

Conclusion

The recent data obtained at CERN-SPS with heavy ion beams (charmonium suppression, strangeness enhancement) are consistent with the predicted signatures of a quark-gluon plasma and can not be explained using "conventional" hadronic interactions scenarios. In order to study the properties of the deconfined state in the coming heavy ion experiments at BNL-RHIC and CERN-LHC, the "hard probes", as heavy quarkonia and high-pT jets, can be certainly useful. Since such objects are created at the very beginning of the nuclear collision process, these propagates through the dense matter formed at larger time scales, and interact strongly with constituents in the medium. We have shown that distribution of jets over impact parameter and high-mass dimuon spectra in heavy ion collisions at LHC are quite sensitive to the medium-induced parton rescattering and energy losses.
