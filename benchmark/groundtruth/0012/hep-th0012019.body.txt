The quantum evolution of black holes including back reaction effects is an open problem. One can simplify it by considering the scattering of low-energy neutral particles off extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes [\cite=stlo]. If, in addition, we also consider spherically reduced configurations, the theory can be described, in a region very close to the horizon, by a solvable effective model. This model is just the Jackiw-Teitelboim model [\cite=jt] (for details see [\cite=fnn])

[formula]

where the two-dimensional fields of ([\ref=effective]) are related to the four-dimensional metric by the expression [formula], r0 = lq is the extremal radius, and l2 = G is Newton's constant. The fields fi represent null matter. To analyze back reaction effects we have to add to the classical action ([\ref=effective]) the Polyakov-Liouville term

[formula]

The above expression contains a cosmological term with λ2 = l- 2q- 3 to ensure that the extremal geometry remains an exact solution of the one-loop theory. The equations of motion derived from I + IPL in conformal gauge ds2 =  - e2ρdx+dx- are

[formula]

The first equation implies that the two-dimensional metric has a negative constant curvature. To find solutions to the above equations it is convenient to choose the following form of the metric

[formula]

This way only the t± terms survive in the quantum correction to the equations of motion. However it is the choice of those functions t± the crucial point to get the physical solutions. If u and v are the null coordinates associated to the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates of the Reissner-Nordström metric, the absence of ingoing and outgoing fluxes at extremality (where u = x- and v = x+) is given by the conditions tvv(v) = 0 = tuu(u). However, once we send matter the relation v = v(x+) is not the identity although the coordinate u remains equal to x-. This means that in the general situation we have that t(x-) = 0 and [formula]. The incoming quantum flux will be given by [formula], which turns out to be

[formula]

The equations of motion can be solved immediately in the Vadya-type metric

[formula]

where [formula]. The problem is to find the relation between x+ and v coordinates. Defining F(x+) as [formula] and jumping from ([\ref=rnevaporating]) to the conformal gauge we find that

[formula]

The equations of motion, in conformal gauge, imply the following differential equation for F

[formula]

In terms of the mass function the evolution equation is then

[formula]

and, at late times, m(v) is given by [formula]. This implies that as time passes the evaporating black hole approaches the extremal configuration. Moreover the equation ([\ref=masseq]) suggests that the incoming (negative) quantum flux contains the information of the classical stress tensor Tfvv.
