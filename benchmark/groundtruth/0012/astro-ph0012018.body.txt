CURRENT STATUS OF COSMOLOGICAL MODELS WITH MIXED DARK MATTER

INTRODUCTION

A great success of observational cosmology of the last decade has allowed to go from a purely theoretical investigation of possible cosmological models to testing them and constraining their parameters. Currently, the total number of model parameters exceeds ten, they can be separated in few groups:

The parameters related to the geometry of the Universe - Ωtotal, Hubble parameter H0, and three-dimensional curvature k.

The parameters related to the nature and abundance of matter (including dark matter and baryons) in the Universe and the value of cosmological constant (Λ-term), called often as "the dark energy". They are the matter density parameters in the Universe Ωmatter (the sum of Ωcdm, Ων and Ωb), the number of massive species of neutrinos Nν, the energy density of Λ-term ΩΛ, and other parameters of the dark energy (e.g. quintessence, its equation of state p = wρ, etc).

The group of parameters related to the inflationary stage of the Universe, which describes the power spectra of metric perturbations generated. In the simplest version of inflation based on the theory of scalar field these parameters are the amplitudes and the slopes of density perturbation and gravitational wave spectra.

A complete analysis of the cosmological model in constraining all mentioned above parameters (assumed initially as free ones) is currently a difficult task since it requires as excellent technical facilities as a special study of different sets of observational data for their completeness and independence. In view of the imperfection of currently available observational data one usually assumes a simplified model with restricted number of the parameters (and fixed others) and test it by a selected set of observational data.

The goal of the present analysis is to consider a matter-dominated model of the Universe and constrain its parameters by three fundamental tests which have different characteristic scales. These observational tests are the large scale CMB anisotropy (~  1000  h- 1Mpc), the amplitude of the first acoustic peak of Sakharov oscillations (~  100  h- 1Mpc) and the mass function of clusters of galaxies (~  10  h- 1Mpc). The aim of the analysis is to clarify the modern status of such a model: whether it can explain the observations or not, and thus, whether the ΛCDM is the only satisfactory model.

To answer this question we considered a family of matter-dominated cosmological models with the following free parameters:

σ8∈[0.47,0.61], (15 models with step 0.01);

n∈[0.8,1.4], (7 models with step 0.1);

Ων∈[0,0.4], (5 models with step 0.1);

Ωb∈[0.01,0.11], (6 models with step 0.02);

h∈[0.45,0.7], (6 models with step 0.05).

Altogether we had 18900 variants of the model. The broad intervals for parameter variations are specially selected to find all possible solutions for the given tests.

The first parameter, σ8, is a more accurate normalisation of density perturbation spectrum than COBE one, since a probable contribution of primordial gravitational waves into the COBE measured signal. The latter is the only available today data which we can use to find a signature of cosmic gravitational waves.

The second parameter, n, generalises the scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations (Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum) in the simplest way. A power-law spectrum with n < 1 (the "red" one) is predicted in a broad range of inflationary models (Linde, 1983, Lucchin and Matarrese, 1985). In other models it can be both "blue" (n > 1) and non-power-law (the noncomplete list of references includes: Carr and Gilbert (1994), Gottlober and Mücket (1993), Lesgourgues et al. (1997), Lukash and Mikheeva (2000), Lukash et al. (2000), Melchiorri et al. (1999), Mollerach et al. (1994), Semig and Müller (1996)). Here we consider the power-law spectra with a free slope index n within the range.

The introduction of hot dark matter is related with a recent discovery of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which demonstrates that at least one species of neutrino is massive. A careful theoretical analysis of all neutrino experiments argues for three massive species, but this result still requires a confirmation. In the numerical analysis we assumed that Nν = 1. Actually, the value of Nν becomes important only at small scales ([formula], e.g. in the analysis of Lyα-absorbers, the test which we do not consider here).

The fourth parameter, Ωb, influences the transfer function slightly, so, neither mass function of clusters of galaxies nor large scale CMB anisotropy can reveal its value with a high confidence level. Hovewer, Ωb is extremely important for the amplitude of the first acoustic peak of Sakharov oscillations.

The last parameter is Hubble constant. Till now there is some discrepancy in its measurements (Saha et al., 1999, Jha et al., 1999). It is clear that h cannot be smaller than 0.5, but on the other hand, the large value ([formula]) will contradict the age of the oldest globular clusters.

In our analysis there are two derived parameters. The first of them is the abundance of cold dark matter, Ωcdm  =  1 - Ων  -  Ωb. The second one is a relative contribution of primordial gravitational waves into large scale CMB anisotropy, T/S. The latter parameter can be theoretically calculated in any inflationary model. T/S is not discriminated by inflation and vary in a broad interval (we assume T/S∈[0,3] to take into account all possible values). For the majority of inflationary models there is a simple relation between the spectrum slope of primordial gravitational waves, nT, and T/S:

[formula]

where the numerical coefficient slightly depends on scale ( T/S is calculated here for 10o angular scale). Eq.(1) allows to replace one parameter (T/S) by another (nT). It is interesting to note that in power-law inflation there exists an additional relation between n and nT, so in this model T/S can be expressed in terms of n. However, generally such relation is absent (see, e.g., Lukash et al. (2000), Lukash and Mikheeva(2000)). Thus, instead of considering additional constraints related with given inflationary model, we prefer to consider n and T/S as independent variables within their ranges.

MASS FUNCTION OF GALAXY CLUSTERS

The number of massive halos with the mass larger than M can be calculated with help of Press-Schechter (P&S) formalism (Press and Schechter, 1974):

[formula]

where

[formula]

where M = 4ρ0R3 / 3, ρ0 is the matter density in the Universe, δc is a critical density contrast necessary to form a halo (δc = 1.686, see Gunn and Gott (1972)), σR is a dispersion of linear density perturbations in the sphere of radius R which is an integral of the power spectrum of density perturbations

[formula]

where [formula] is a dimensionless power spectrum, P(k)  =  Akn + 3 - a primordial spectrum of density perturbations, A - a normalisation constant, T(k) - a transfer function which depends on Ων, Ωb and h (we used the analytic approximation of the transfer function given by Novosyadlyj et al. (1999)), W(kR) - Fourrier transform of top-hat filter, [formula].

The Figure 1 illustrates how the function N( > M) depends on σ8 with other parameters fixed. As it was mentioned in the Introduction, σ8 affects efficiently the height of P&S curves which one can use to determine σ8. The Figure 2 demonstrates the behaviour of N( > M) as a function of Ων. Taking a given σ8 (0.52 in the Figure 2) fixes the amplitude of P&S curve at the mass value in the sphere with radius 8  h- 1Mpc, while different values of Ων change the slope of the curve. In both Figures the circles with errorbars mark the observational data. For the rest parameters, N( > M) varies with a much smaller amplitude and we do not adduce the corresponding figures. The observational data in the Figures 1 and 2 are taken from Bahcall and Cen (1993).

To analyse the cosmological models we have used the standard χ2 method. At the first step we have calculated χ2 for each model (this function is χ2 distributed with 5 degrees of freedom; Nd.f.  =  Nobs.points  -  Nparameters  =  10 - 5). It turns out that the model with the minimal χ2 (χ2min = 1.43) has the following parameters: σ8 = 0.52, n = 1.3, Ων = 0.3, Ωb = 0.01, h = 0.7. To evaluate the confidence level of this result we took into account the mathematical theorems available for χ2 and constructed other distributions for each parameter Δχ21(a)  =  χ2a  -  χ2min, where a is one of the five cosmological parameters, χ2a is a minimal χ2 on the hypersurface a = const in 5-dimensional model space. Δχ21(a) is also χ2 distributed but has the only degree of freedom. The confidence levels 1, 2 and 3σ correspond to Δχ21(a) = 1, 4, and 9 respectively. Δχ21(a) for a = σ8 is shown in the Figure 3 (the curve marked by "  ×  "). One can see that σ8  =  0.52  ±  0.01. The uncertainties of the Press-Schechter formalism and data systematics enhances the total errorbar to 0.04 (Eke et al., 1996, Borgani et al., 1999).

To evaluate the accuracy of the approximation of the transfer function and its influence on the output we have repeated this statistical analysis (see Figure 3, the line marked by " + ") with another analytic expression for the transfer function (Eisenstein and Hu, 1999) and found that both approximations lead to the same result.

As to the other cosmological parameters (n, Ων, Ωb, h) their Δχ21(a) are under 1σ confidence level, therefore they cannot be constrained by the cluster data only. So, as a result of this part of our analysis we have obtained the high accuracy normalisation of the density perturbation spectra. It is evident that the obtained value of σ8 depends on observational data used and can be slightly different if one uses other data (e.g. Borgani et., 1999).

CMB ANISOTROPY

Large Scale CMB Anisotropy

The large scale CMB anisotropy is related with metric perturbations (Sachs and Wolfe, 1967):

[formula]

where E and R are emission and reception moments of time, hik is a metric perturbation tensor, ∂  /  ∂η is the conformal time derivative, the integral goes along the null geodesics.

The relative contribution of cosmic gravitational waves into the large scale CMB anisotropy (T/S) can estimated as follows:

[formula]

where S is the contribution of the density perturbations:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

We evaluate the normalisation constant A from Eq.(4) for σ8, [formula] is COBE DMR window function.

Figure 4 illustrates T/S as a function of n and Ων for σ8 = 0.52, Ωb = 0.05 and h = 0.5. The thick line represents the T/S-n relation for the power-law inflation. It can be seen that small values of T/S favour red spectra of density perturbations.

The Figure 5 demonstrates T/S as a function of n and h for σ8 = 0.52, Ωb = 0.05, and large Ων = 0.4. The value T/S increases linearly with h and decreases with Ων growing, therefore the curves T/S with the maximum parameter Ων  =  0.4 can be used to put the lower limit on T/S (see Conclusions).

Taking a moderate T/S< 0.5 and nearly flat power spectrum (0.92  ≤  n  ≤  1.02), we put an upper limit on the Hubble constant, h < 0.6, and lower limit on the hot dark matter abundance, Ων > 0.1. However, the hardest constraint for the parameter Ων can be got when we confront the amplitude of the first acoustic peak in ΔT / T ([formula]) with the observational data.

For σ8 = 0.52, Ωb = 0.05 and h = 0.5 we propose the following approximation for T/S (the accuracy is better than 11 % for 0.1  ≤  T/S≤  3):

[formula]

The Medium Scale CMB Anisotropy

To compare the height of the first acoustic peak generated in our models with its value measured by BOOMERanG (Lange et al., 2000) and MAXIMA-1 (Balbi et al., 2000) we introduce the dimensionless parameter [formula] which is the amplitude of the peak in comparison with the large scale CMB anisotropy amplitude: [formula], where [formula]; [formula] for BOOMERanG.

Evidently, [formula] decreases with T/S growing (and other parameters fixed). E.g. for normalised by σ8 standard Cold Dark Matter models (Ων = 0, n = 1, Ωb = 0.08, h = 0.5) the relative amplitude of the acoustic peak decays by a factor T/S+ 1≃4 and practically disappears.

The more efficient ways to enhance the first acoustic peak is a transition to the red power spectra and/or high abundance of the hot matter. The role of the blue spectra becomes important when the parameter Ων rises up (since the red spectra will contradict to the condition T/S≥  0). The results of the derivation are presented in the Figure 6. The condition for a "considerable" acoustic peak ([formula]) with the instantaneous Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraint for the baryonic density, leaves us with the standard family of the power spectra (n∈[0.9,1.2]) but requires high fraction of the hot matter (Ων∈[0.2,0.4]) in the class of the models considered.

Varying Ωb we found that increasing Ωb by factor of two results in a significant rise of the acoustic peak independently on n and Ων, so for models with Ωb = 0.1, n∈[0.9,1.2] and Ων∈[0.2,0.4]: [formula]. As to the parameter h, its increasing decreases the acoustic peak amplitude. Summarizing, we can conclude that MDM models with gravitational waves can marginally reproduce the BOOMERanG result indeed.

CONCLUSIONS

The data on the galaxy cluster abundance determine the value σ8 with a high accuracy, the other parameters (n,Ων,Ωb,h) remain free within their ranges.

None of the MDM models with n = 1 and T / S = 0 satisfies both normalisations, on the galaxy cluster abundance and large scale ΔT / T anisotropy, which leads either to rejection from the flat spectrum or to the introduction of a non-zero T/S (or both).

Small values of T/S are realised for the red spectra (n < 1) and moderate h( < 0.6), the violation of these conditions leads to a high T/S([formula]).

Increasing Ων weakens the requirement to the value of T/S, however even for Ων  ≤  0.4 the models with h + n  ≥  1.5 suggest considerable abundance of gravitational waves: T  /  S>~0.3.

In models with Ων  ≤  0.4 and scale-invariant spectrum of density perturbations (n = 1): T/S[formula].

In models with Ωb = 0.05 and h = 0.5 we have the approximation formula for the primordial gravitational wave abundance (see Eq.(10)).

In double-normalised models with T/S>  0 the height of the acoustic peak is less than its 'standard' value ([formula]). The decrease of the parameter [formula] does not exceed 30% in models with large Ων (∈[0.2,0.4]) and any spectrum slope, n∈[0.9,1.2]. Any condition, n < 0.9 or Ων < 0.2, decreases the relative amplitude of the first acoustic peak for more than 30% (i.e. [formula] in models with Ωb = 0.05, h = 0.5). The acoustic peak practically disappears in CDM models.

When growing the baryonic abundance the factor [formula] increases. The amplitude of the acoustic peak coincides with its 'standard' value ([formula]) up to accuracy 10% in models with Ωb = 0.1 and both, blue spectra n∈[1,1.2] and Ων  ≥  0.3 as well as moderate red spectra n∈[0.9,1] and Ων  ≥  0.2.

Thus, rising the parameter Ων up to the values in the interval
