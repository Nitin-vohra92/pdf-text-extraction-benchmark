Magnetic Field Decay Makes Neutron Stars Look Older Than They Are

Magnetic Field Decay of Neutron Stars

A rapidly spinning neutron star loses its rotational energy by magnetic dipole radiation (Pacini 1968) and outflow of charged particles accelerated in its magnetosphere (Goldreich 1969), i.e., [formula], where ω is its angular frequency and [formula], in which M is its dipole magnetic moment and I is its moment of inertia; its surface dipole magnetic field strength can thus be estimated as, [formula], where P and [formula] are its spin period and period derivative, respectively. Then assuming [formula], the neutron star's age can be calculated as, [formula], or if P  ≫  P0, [formula], commonly referred to as its characteristic or spin-down age. More generally, the spin-down law can be written as, [formula], or, [formula]. Defining a measurable quantity, the so-called braking index, [formula], it is easy to show (Lyne 2006), [formula]. Assuming n = 3, nb < 3 indicates [formula], or vice versa (Lyne 1975, Chanmugam 1995, Lyne 2004, Lyne 2006, Chen 2006). However the number of neutron stars with reliably measured nb is currently very small (Chen 2006).

Many studies on the possible magnetic field decay of neutron stars have been done previously, based on the observed statistics of P and [formula] of neutron stars. Some of these previous studies used the spin-down ages as indicators of the true ages of neutron stars and found evidence for their dipole magnetic field decay (Pacini 1969, Ostriker 1969, Gunn 1970); however as we will show in the following, their spin-down ages are normally significantly different from their true ages. Alternatively other studies relied on population synthesis that includes complicated observational selection effects, unknown initial parameters of neutron stars, and not completely understood models of radio emission of pulsars (Holt 1970, Bhattacharya 1992, Han 1997, Regimbau 2001, Gonthier 2002, Guseinov 2004, Aguilera 2008, Popov 2010). Consequently so far there is no consensus on if and how neutron star's magnetic field decays (see (Harding 2006a, Ridley 2010, Lorimer 2011) for reviews).

The true age of a neutron star can be given from the age of the supernova remnant physically associated with it, since they both were produced during the same supernova explosion. A supernova remnant expands and interacts with its surrounding interstellar medium, and thus its age, TSNR, may be calculated by modeling its morphology at the current epoch. The ages of neutron stars obtained this way are independent of the properties of neutron stars and thus unbiased in principle. In figure 1 (upper panel) we show the distribution of TSNR / Ts; clearly for many of them TSNR / Ts  ≪  1, i.e., many neutron stars look much older than their associated supernova remnants. The distribution is possibly bi-modal, divided by [formula] ; we will return to this point later. In figure 1 (lower panel) we show the correlation between TSNR / Ts and the dipole magnetic field strength B. The strong and significant positive correlation suggests that low values of B at the current epoch is the major cause for TSNR / Ts  ≪  1. This immediately suggests that magnetic field decay plays a significant role in making neutron stars appear older than they really are, at least for neutron stars younger than about one million years. This general idea was suggested previously (Lyne 1975, Geppert 1999, Ruderman 2005), but so far has not been compared between data and models statistically.

With the true ages of neutron stars available, we can then study the correlations between their ages and their other two observables normally available with each pulsar, namely, P and [formula], as shown in figure 2. Assuming heuristically that all neutron stars were born with the same properties, the trends shown here can be explained as the evolutionary tracks of neutron stars. These trends suggest that, as neutron stars become older, their periods become longer, their period derivatives becomes smaller, and their dipole magnetic field becomes weaker. One may argue that the observed trend of their dipole magnetic fields may be a mathematical artifact, because B and [formula] are positively correlated mathematically. However this argument does not hold, because B and P are also positively correlated in the same way mathematically. It is actually physically more meaningful to conclude that it is the magnetic field decay of neutron stars that causes [formula] decreases rapidly with time.

Several physical mechanisms have been proposed for magnetic field decay in neutron stars, e.g., ohmic dissipation, Hall effect, and ambipolar diffusion. We can therefore have (Goldreich 1992, Heyl 1998), [formula], in which [formula], [formula] (for the solenoidal component), [formula] (for the irrotational component), and [formula], where B12 is the surface magnetic field strength in units of 1012 G, T8 denotes the core temperature in units of 108 K, [formula] g cm- 3 is the nuclear density, and L5 is a characteristic length scale of the flux loops through the outer core in units of 105 cm.

Assuming T8 does not vary or only varies slowly with time (Pons 2009), the ohmic dissipation produces exponential decay of magnetic field, B = B0e- t / τd, where τd is referred to as the decay time scale. The other two mechanisms all produce power-law decay, B = B0(t / t0)-  α, where the decay index α = 1 or α = 0.5 for Hall effect or ambipolar diffusion (for [formula] years), respectively. For the exponential decay, the true age of a neutron star is given by (Lyne 1975) [formula]. For the power-law decay, the true age of a neutron star is given by [formula] (for α < 0.5 and Tp  ≫  t0), or [formula] (for α = 0.5), or [formula] (for α > 0.5), respectively (in the above t0 and B0 are the age and dipole magnetic field strength of a neutron star when it started its current phase of magnetic field decay). Because of the coupling between t0 and α when [formula], we will first discuss the case α < 0.5 in the following. We stress that only [formula] and [formula] are assumed in deriving the above relations.

In figure 3, we compare predictions of the exponential or power-law magnetic field decay with the observed correlation between Ts and TSNR of neutron stars; for convenience we take n = 3 for the moment and we will discuss more general cases later. Clearly the exponential decay model cannot describe the data points for most young neutron stars. The power-law decay model can describe the data points if different populations of neutron stars are allowed to take different values of α. The dipole magnetic field strength of each neutron star is shown in the same panel, suggesting that neutron stars with weaker dipole magnetic field tend to have larger α; this is a generic prediction of the model if their initial dipole magnetic fields have similar strengths.

In figure 4, we show the distribution of α, derived from figure 3 by counting the number of neutron stars in each interval of α. A striking bi-modal distribution is obvious, indicating that about half of neutron stars have no or very weak magnetic field decay (α  ≈  0) and the other half have very rapid magnetic field decay (α  ≈  0.5). This bi-modal distribution is actually another manifestation of the bi-modal distribution shown in figure 1 (upper panel); however here the two peaks are well separated, indicating that the power-law description of their dipole magnetic field decay is appropriate and physical. If we take α = 0.5, then Tp log (Tp / t0) = Ts, i.e., it is possible to reproduce all observed data points with Tp / Ts > 1 by adjusting t0. For α > 0.5 and [formula], (Tp / t0)2α - 1  ≈  1 and thus α  ≈  0.5 can also reproduce all observed data points with Tp / Ts > 1. Therefore we conclude that the ambipolar diffusion (α = 0.5) dominates the magnetic field decay for nearly half of the young neutron stars associated with supernova remnants, implying that tambip  <  tohmic and tambip  <  thall. Clearly the first condition can be easily met for physically plausible parameters of neutron stars. The second condition, i.e., tambip  <  thall requires B0  >  6  ×  1012 G, about the dipole magnetic field strengths of these neutron stars without significant magnetic field decay, i.e., TSNR  ≈  Ts.

It is notable that there is one neutron star (PSR B1757-24) with Ts < TSNR. In this case, [formula] is required, taking n = 3 as above (please do not confuse n with nb here and throughout this paper). This agrees with the suggestion that its non-recovered glitches have significantly increased its dipole magnetic field (Lin 2004). In addition, the distribution peak at TSNR = Ts, shown in figure 1 (upper panel), requires n = 3, if [formula] for these neutron stars. Therefore n = 3 assumed above is reasonable. On the other hand, the general expression of the spin-down age is [formula]. Because P clearly increases with time statistically, as shown in figure 2 (upper panel), P  ≈  P0 is not plausible. Therefore [formula] is required for these neutron stars with TSNR  ≪  Ts if there is no significant magnetic field decay; this is clearly also not plausible. Alternatively, n < 3 makes the spin-down age (Ts,n) of a neutron star even longer than assuming n = 3; in this case more or even all neutron stars have Ts,n > TSNR, i.e., [formula] for more or even all of these neutron stars. We therefore conclude that for any reasonable values of n, at least some of these neutron stars must have experienced significant decay of their dipole magnetic fields.

Discussion

It has been believed that magnetic field decay powers the persistent X-ray emission of magnetars (Thompson 1995, Thompson 1996). It has also been suggested that their magnetic field decay plays a significant role in their thermal evolution (Pons 2009), and thus has significant implications to understanding the neutron star's equation of state. Here by comparing the spin-down and true ages of young neutron stars, we find convincing evidence for magnetic field decay in about half of them. For magnetic field decay dominated by the ambipolar diffusion (α = 0.5), it is easy to show that [formula]. Taking the typical values of B12  ~  1, [formula] yr, and L5  ~  1, its core temperature is predicted to be roughly [formula] K, corresponding to a surface temperature (Arras 2004) of [formula] K and consistent with observations (Pons 2009).

It however remains puzzling why these neutron stars discussed here, that are observed as normal radio pulsars, have experienced such diverse evolutionary routes: the magnetic fields increase in very few neutron stars, remain nearly constant in about half of them, or decrease rapidly in others. Perhaps these neutron stars were born with different physical properties (Han 1997); understanding the initial conditions of neutron stars will inevitably advance our understanding of stellar evolution, supernova explosion, and the equation of state of neutron stars significantly.
