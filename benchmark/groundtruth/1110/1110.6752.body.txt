Exactly solvable pairing models inspired by high-Tc superconductivity

Introduction.- One of the major unsolved problems of theoretical condensed matter physics is how superconductivity arises in high-temperature superconductors. The mechanism of electron pair formation in these crystals is still obscure. Although there have been many promising leads, a real explanation remains exclusive or even controversial. One of the prime reasons for this is that the superconductive materials are normally very complex, multi-layered crystals such that it is hard to have accurate theoretical solutions either from exactly solvable models or trustworthy numerical methods on such strongly interacting electron systems.

There have been two representative theories for the unconventional superconductivity, the d-wave pairing related to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations [\cite=Monthoux92] and the modified BCS-type (s-wave) pairing [\cite=Anderson93]. None of them are fully accepted, but both of them are associated with sort of pairing mechanism.

In this letter, I start with a general electron Hamiltonian and consider a family of pairing models, including those with the BCS pairs [\cite=BCS], the η pairs [\cite=Yang] and the d-wave pairs [\cite=SO5] [\cite=SO5Wu] in Tc superconductivity. I find exact solutions to this family, with the assistance of the dressing transformations introduced for qubits [\cite=Wu03]. The total electron spin [formula] of these models are not conserved except for the BCS model, while the conservation of the z-component Sz of the total spin remains. These models are legitimate as physical Hamiltonians only on an xy - plane defined by Sz, which is compatible with the two dimensionality of high Tc superconductivity. Different pairings in these models are on equal footing in the sense that they can be transformed unitarily into each other. In particular, these models can be converted to the conventional BCS model, with an interesting extra single-particle energy. I study this extra contribution of single-particle energy and observe that it plays a decisive role in a transition between independent-particle ground states and collective η-pairing or d-wave pairing ground states. I find conditions where non-BCS pairs, including the η-pairs and the d-wave pairs, play an identical role as the BCS pairs. In this case, the ansatz in constructing the BCS model implies that these non-BCS pairs could become dominant.

Vectors q have the same modes as k. The interaction can be rewritten as
