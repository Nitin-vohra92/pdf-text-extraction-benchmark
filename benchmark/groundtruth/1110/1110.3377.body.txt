Superfast Thinning of a Nanoscale Thin Liquid Film

Thin liquid films may show a very thin stable phase of nanometer scale. Since the film is no longer visible by optical wavelengths at this thickness, it is called a Black Film [\cite=derjaguin1989theory]. The evolution of an initially thick, freestanding film towards this equilibrium thickness is a slow process which can be observed as a flat boundary of Black Film on top of a periodic color pattern moving downwards. The colors correspond to the repeated negative interference of light waves when the condition n  ·  λ / 4 is met. This process is driven by gravitation and surface forces, but the time scale is set by the Poiseuille flow between the film interfaces [\cite=couder1989hydrodynamics], cf. Fig. [\ref=fig:thinningsequence], 75s and 115s.

When the thin film is driven, the motion may change due to the altered transport properties. We explore this possibility by thermal driving with a cold copper rod at 100  K, corresponding to a Rayleigh number of 107. This establishes two stable convection rolls, Fig. [\ref=fig:thinningsequence], 195s-275s and gives rise to large mechanical and thermal fluctuations. These fluctuations in turn generate spontaneously spots of stable and light black film inside the unstable thick and heavy phase. The spots are convected for small size until they eventually escape to the top due to buoyancy. While being convected, the spots grow and leave behind tails of Black Film, thereby increasing the Black Film area in an exponential manner, cf. Fig. [\ref=fig:thinningsequence], 280  s -  - 305  s.
