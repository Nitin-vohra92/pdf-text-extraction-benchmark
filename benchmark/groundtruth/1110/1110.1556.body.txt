Jewish Problems

A personal story of Tanya Khovanova

In the summer of 1975, while I was in a Soviet math camp preparing to compete in the International Math Olympiad on behalf of the Soviet Union, my fellow team members and I were approached for help by Valera Senderov, a math teacher in one of Moscow's best special math schools.

The Mathematics Department of Moscow State University, the most prestigious mathematics school in Russia, was at that time actively trying to keep Jewish students (and other "undesirables") from enrolling in the department. One of the methods they used for doing this was to give the unwanted students a different set of problems on their oral exam. I was told that these problems were carefully designed to have elementary solutions (so that the Department could avoid scandals) that were nearly impossible to find. Any student who failed to answer could easily be rejected, so this system was an effective method of controlling admissions. These kinds of math problems were informally referred to as "Jewish" problems or "coffins". "Coffins" is the literal translation from Russian; they have also been called "killer" problems in English.

These problems and their solutions were, of course, kept secret, but Valera Senderov and his friends had managed to collect a list. In 1975, they approached us to solve these problems, so that they could train the Jewish and other students in these mathematical ideas. Our team of the best eight Soviet students, during the month we had the problems, solved only half of them. True, that we had other priorities, but this fact speaks to the difficulty of these problems.

Being young and impressionable, I was shaken by this whole situation. I had had no idea that such blatant discrimination had been going on. In addition to trying to solve them at the time, I kept these problems as my most valuable possession--I still have that teal notebook.

Later, I emigrated to the United States. When I started my own web page, one of the first things I did was to post some of the problems. People sent me more problems, and solutions to the ones I had. It turned out that not all of the coffins even had elementary solutions: some were intentionally ambiguous questions, some were just plain hard, some had impossible premises. This article is a selection from my collection; we picked out some choice problems that do contain interesting tricks or ideas.

Introduction

Discrimination against Jewish people at the entrance exams to the most prestigious universities in the USSR is a documented fact, see A. Shen [\cite=Shen] and A. Vershik [\cite=Vershik]. Alexander Shen in his article published 25 problems that were given to Jewish applicants. Later Ilan Vardi wrote solutions to all those problems, see I. Vardi's homepage [\cite=Vardi]. These and other articles were published later in a book, "You Failed Your Math Test, Comrade Einstein: Adventures and Misadventures of Young Mathematicians, Or Test Your Skills in Almost Recreational Mathematics." [\cite=Shifman].

In the present collection we have only one problem that overlaps with the problems that Vardi solved, and we give an easier and more surprising solution.

Now, after thirty years, these problems seem easier. Mostly, this is because the ideas of how to solve these problems have spread and are now a part of the standard set of ideas. Thirty years ago these problems were harder to solve and, in addition, the students were given these problems one after another until they failed one of them, at which point they were given a failing mark.

To give readers an opportunity to try and solve these problems we separated problems, key ideas, and solutions. Section [\ref=sec:problems] contains 21 problems. In the subsequent Section [\ref=sec:ideas] we give hints or main ideas for the solutions. Finally, Section [\ref=sec:solutions] contains solutions.

Solutions

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:1]

First, observe that for x  >  1, the terms in ([\ref=pr1:eq]) become undefined. Next, define y per the idea ([\ref=pr1:sub]):

[formula]

Observe that for permissible values of x, we have

[formula]

and y is monotonically decreasing in x. Observe also that

[formula]

Given the above preliminaries, our inequality transforms as follows:

[formula]

Now, - 4y2  +  4y  -  10 is always negative, so our monstrous inequality reduces, in the end, to the humble

[formula]

Invoking the monotonicity of y in x and the fact that

[formula]

our final answer is

[formula]

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:7]

Inequality ([\ref=pr7:prob]) implies

[formula]

so the derivative of F at any point x2 exists and is equal to zero. Therefore, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the constant functions are exactly the functions with the desired property.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:10]

Pick a point M' anywhere on BC. Construct L on AB such that

[formula]

Now we want to parallel translate AL so that its image will satisfy ([\ref=pr10:prob]) with CM'. To do this, construct through L a line parallel to AC, and on it construct the point K' such that

[formula]

Construct through K' a line parallel to AB, and let it intersect the angle ACB at points A' and B'. Then the triangle A'B'C and the points K' and M' satisfy ([\ref=pr10:prob]), and A'B'C is similar to ABC. Perform a homothety (also called a dilation) about C and you're done. Figure [\ref=pr10:fig] illustrates.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:12]

Define

[formula]

Then ([\ref=pr12:prob]) becomes

[formula]

Since x and y are given by the same function g of each other, and g is monotonically increasing, we can conclude

[formula]

The equation is now a standard high-school cubic

[formula]

solvable by the method of guessing a small integer root and factoring. Indeed,

[formula]

is a root, and the factor y2 + y - 1 yields two more roots

[formula]

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:17]

First, rearrange ([\ref=pr17:prob]) into

[formula]

Now there are two cases: Case , cos x  -   sin x  =  0: Then

[formula]

Case , otherwise: We can cancel cos x  -   sin x, and get

[formula]

Substituting

[formula]

we find that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

so ([\ref=sol17:big]) reduces to

[formula]

But

[formula]

so

[formula]

Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:19]

a) The point M must be outside the angle opposite to C. Construct points A and B on the angle such that

[formula]

Then inscribe a circle into the angle tangent at those two points, and draw a tangent from M to that circle. The resulting triangle has the desired perimeter. This construction is illustrated in Figure [\ref=pr19:fig1].

b) If M is outside the angle, the minimum perimeter is 0. If it is inside, then draw a circle through M away from C that is tangent to the angle, and take a tangent to it as in part a. It is not hard to see from Figure [\ref=pr19:fig1] that the resulting triangle has minimum perimeter.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:22]

The end points of the diameter and M form a triangle in which we need to draw a height, see Figure [\ref=pr22:fig]. The height passes through the orthocenter, which is easy to construct as the bases of the other two heights lie on the circle. If M is inside the circle, the construction is the same.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:26]

The situation is represented in Figure [\ref=pr26:fig]. The points B, C, and O go to the points B', C', and O', respectively, under rotation about A by [formula]. The marked equalities follow by the properties of rotation. The desired triangle is then COO'. The angles in question are

[formula]

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:30]

In Figure [\ref=pr30i:fig], the sum of the areas of the two triangles ABD and CBD equals the area of the triangle ABC. Canceling the length of the side BC( = AB), the sum of the heights from point D equals the height from point A (and the height from point C).

Therefore, the locus is a rectangle whose vertices are the four points that are each on one of the lines and at the desired distance from the other: Figure [\ref=pr30:fig1].

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:31]

Place masses at the vertices of the quadrilateral such that the center of mass of each edge falls onto a point of tangency. One way to do this is to place, at each vertex, a mass equal to 1 over the distance from that the vertex to each point of tangency of the edges that vertex is on (the two distances must be equal). Then the center of mass of the whole arrangement will have to be on each line connecting pairs of opposite points of tangency. Therefore, these lines intersect, and all four points of tangency are in one plane, as desired.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:38]

Observe that

[formula]

where ([\ref=pr38:sol1]) holds by repeated application of the sine and cosine angle sum formulae. Let

[formula]

Then ([\ref=pr38:sol2]) reduces to

[formula]

All rational roots of this must be integers and divide the constant term. Since ±  1 do not work, all roots must be irrational.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:42]

If we take a right triangle ABC with integer sides, the area will be rational. Therefore, the height onto the hypotenuse AC will be rational. This means that if we reflect this triangle about the hypotenuse, we will have four points in the plane all at rational distances from each other.

Now, let the base of that height be at point D. Then, since the triangle ABC is similar to the triangle BDC, the distances AD and CD will both be rational. Therefore, reflecting the whole thing about the perpendicular bisector of AC yields two more points, so that all six are at rational distances from each other. All that's left now is to expand by a multiplicative factor that clears all the denominators.

Start with the 3, 4, 5 Pythagorean triangle, lay the hypotenuse along the x axis, with the center at the origin, perform the above construction, and scale by 10 to clear denominators. Six such points are:

[formula]

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:45]

Suppose one of the vertices is at the origin. Suppose the coordinates of the two other vertices are (a,b) and (c,d). If all the numbers are divisible by two, we can reduce the triangle by half. Thus, we can assume that one of the numbers is not divisible by 2. Suppose a is odd.

If b is odd, then a2  +  b2 is of the form 4k + 2. As a2 + b2  =  c2  +  d2 we must conclude that both c and d are odd. But the square of the length of the third side is (a - c)2  +  (b - d)2, which is divisible by 4. So the triangle can't be equilateral.

If b is even, then a2  +  b2 is of the form 4k + 1. As a2 + b2  =  c2  +  d2 we must conclude that c and d have different parity. Hence, a - c and b - d have the same parity and, correspondingly, the square of the length of the third side is again even. Contradiction.

For another solution, observe that the angle any segment between two grid vertices makes with either axis has to have a rational tangent. In addition, as

[formula]

the tangent of the sum (or difference) of two angles with rational tangents is rational. Therefore any non-right angle given by grid points has rational tangent. Since [formula] is irrational, the equilateral triangle cannot have all three vertices on a square grid.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:48]

Consider the parallel translation of the sides AD and BC so that A' and B' are at E, shown in Figure [\ref=pr48sol1:fig]. Then the triangles CC'F and DD'F are equal, because they have two equal sides with an equal angle between them. Therefore, F is the median of the triangle EC'D'. We can reconstruct a triangle from the lengths of its two sides and the median between them, which gives us the angle the original sides AD and BC made with each other.

The reconstruction of that triangle is equal to the triangle AC''D in Figure [\ref=pr48sol2:fig], where AC'' is the parallel translation of BC so that B'' is at A. But we are given the distance between C and D and between C and C'', so we can find C by constructing the intersection of two circles. Constructing B is easy.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:49]

Take the cyclic quadrilateral with the given sides and inscribe it into a circle. Consider the parts of the circle between the circumference and the quadrilateral as firmly attached to the sides. Consider a different quadrilateral with the given sides and the same parts attached to it shown in gray in Figure [\ref=pr49:fig]. The new figure will have the same perimeter as the perimeter of the circle, hence necessarily lesser area. Since the attached parts have fixed area, the quadrilateral must have lesser area as well.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:50]

Given a segment and a parallel line we can always divide the segment into two equal parts. Take two points on the parallel line. Together with the ends of the segment the points form a trapezoid. Continue the sides to form a triangle. The segment passing through the third vertex of the triangle and the intersection of the diagonals of the trapezoid divides both parallel segments into two equal parts.

Using the division method above, divide one of the segments into eight equal parts. Pick six of these parts consecutively. Then perform a homothety mapping their union onto the other segment. The center of the homothety is the intersection of the other sides of the trapezoid formed by the six segments and the target segment. See Figure [\ref=pr50:fig].

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:52]

We will compare log 23 and log 35 to 3 / 2, both by the method of applying the same monotonic functions to both sides until we get something known.

First, compare log 23 and 3 / 2. The functions 2x and x2 are monotonic (at least for positive x), so we can use the composition of them to remove ugly pieces from our numbers:

[formula]

Second, compare log 35 and 3 / 2. The functions 3x and x2 are monotonic:

[formula]

Hence log 23  >   log 35.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:61]

Clearly, 125100  =  10300 / 2300. Also, 2300  =  102430  =  1090  ×  1.02430. So

[formula]

Let's estimate 1.02430. For any number slightly bigger than 1 we can use the binomial formula: [formula]. In our case x  <  1 / 40. We can estimate each term after 1 as 0.75, 0.27, and 0.06. We see that they are getting smaller very fast. So we know that 1  <  1.02430  <  10, which gives us 210 digits for 125100.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:65]

Let [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Consider three numbers: 1, w, w2, where w is a primitive cube root of 1. Consider the nine terms of the form x  +  wiy  +  wjz, where i and j are 0, 1, or 2. If we multiply them we get an expression with all real coefficients, because it is self-conjugate. In addition, replacing y with wy doesn't change the product, so the powers of y present in the result have to be divisible by 3. Analogously, the powers of z have to be divisible by 3. Consequently, as the product is homogeneous, the powers of x have to be divisible by 3.

Thus the resulting product is a polynomial of a, b, and c. Explicitly, if we multiply the denominator and numerator by (x  +  wy  +  w2z)(x  +  w2y  +  wz)(x  +  y  +  wz)(x  +  y  +  w2z)(x  +  wy  +  z)(x  +  w2y  +  z)(x  +  wy  +  wz)(x  +  w2y  +  w2z), the denominator becomes (a + b  +  c)3  -  27abc.

We might try to simplify the calculation by initially multiplying the numerator and denominator by (x  +  wy  +  w2z)(x  +  w2y  +  wz)  =  x2  +  y2  -  yz  +  z2  -  x(y  +  z). We get

[formula]

Now the denominator is of the form [formula] and has only one radical. To get rid of it we can multiply the denominator and the numerator by [formula]. The denominator becomes s3  -  t  =  (a + b + c)3  -  27abc.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:68]

Suppose A, B, C and D denote the points on the sides of the square, in order. Connect A and C. Draw a perpendicular from B to the segment AC. Let point D' lie on the perpendicular given that the distance BD' is the same as the length of AC. Then D' belongs to the same side (or extension of the side) of the square as D. See Figure [\ref=pr68:fig]. Once we know from DD' how the square is oriented, the rest is easy.

Solution to problem [\ref=pr:71]

Let A be the point on the function that lies on the middle line between and parallel to the two lines. If we move the cut off point to the right, then the area under the function increases faster than the area over the function decreases. Moving to the left is symmetric.
