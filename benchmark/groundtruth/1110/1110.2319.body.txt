Coherent vortex structures in quantum turbulence

It has been known since the 1980's that homogeneous isotropic turbulence contains intermittent worm-like regions of concentrated vorticity [\cite=Siggia] [\cite=Kerr] [\cite=Sreeni85] [\cite=Douady] [\cite=Moffatt] [\cite=Sreeni-Antonia] [\cite=Moisy-Jimenez]. Their role in the dynamics of turbulence is not clear [\cite=Frisch]: there is no consensus as to whether they are responsible for the main properties of turbulence (e.g the celebrated Kolmogorov energy spectrum) or only affect the tails of statistical distributions and the exponents of high-order structure functions. Turbulence is also studied at temperatures near absolute zero in superfluid helium [\cite=Vinen] [\cite=Manchester] [\cite=Lancaster] [\cite=Helsinki]. Here the viscosity is zero, and the vorticity is concentrated in thin, discrete vortex lines of fixed core radius and circulation (whereas vortices in ordinary fluids are viscous and can have any size and strength). This 'quantum turbulence' shares important properties with the ordinary (classical) turbulence [\cite=Vinen] [\cite=Skrbek] [\cite=Lvov_2006], from the same drag force on a moving sphere [\cite=VanSciver] to the Kolmogorov energy spectrum in homogeneous isotropic turbulence [\cite=Tabeling] [\cite=Grenoble] [\cite=Nore] [\cite=Tsubota-vd] [\cite=Tsubota-GP] [\cite=Baggaley-density]. Here we show that, alongside the Kolmogorov spectrum, quantized vortices tend to form coherent structures, similar to the vortex tubes of ordinary turbulence. Despite its relative simplicity, quantum turbulence seems to share important features of generic turbulent flows.

At temperatures T below 0.7  K, thermal excitations become ballistic (in that sense that their propagation is not affected by any interaction with the background) so that liquid 4He is effectively a pure superfluid. Because of the quantum-mechanical constraints on the rotation, its flow is everywhere potential with the exception of vortex line singularities of atomic thickness (the core radius is approximately [formula]), each line carrying one quantum of circulation κ = h / m = 10- 7  m2 / s, where h is Planck's constant and m is the mass of the single helium atom. (In liquid 3He-B, which becomes superfluid at much lower temperatures, T < 1  mK, the core radius is about 80  nm, and the quantum of circulation is [formula], where m is the atomic mass of the 3He isotope, whose nuclei are fermions.) Quantum turbulence, readily created by stirring the liquid helium, takes the form of an apparently disordered tangle of such vortex lines. The question which we ask is whether discrete quantized vortex filaments organize themselves and form coherent structures, as in ordinary turbulence.

To model quantum turbulence in the zero-temperature limit, we observe that a0 is many orders of magnitude smaller than the typical distance, [formula]-10- 6  m, between vortex lines in experiments, so it is appropriate to describe vortex lines as space curves [formula] of infinitesimal thickness which move according to the Biot-Savart law [\cite=Saffman]

[formula]

where [formula] is the position vector of a point on the vortex line, t is time, ξ is the arc length measured along the vortex line, and the integral extends over the entire vortex configuration L. Equation ([\ref=eq1]) states classical incompressible Euler dynamics in integral form. However, unlike classical Euler vortices, quantized vortices reconnect if they come sufficiently close to each other, as seen directly in recent experiments [\cite=Maryland] and demonstrated using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the Bose-Einstein condensate [\cite=Koplik]. To apply equation ([\ref=eq1]) to superfluid helium we must therefore add an algorithmic reconnection procedure [\cite=Schwarz].

We perform numerical simulations of reconnecting vortex lines at T = 0 evolving according equation ([\ref=eq1]) in a period cubic box of the size [formula]. The technique to discretize the vortex lines, the regularization of the Biot-Savart integral, and the vortex reconnection procedure are standard and well described in the literature [\cite=Schwarz] [\cite=Tsubota-vd]. Our numerical algorithm, which controls the discretization, enforces a separation Δξ between points on the vortex line to remain between 2  ×  10- 6  m and 4  ×  10- 6  m during the evolution; this is therefore the numerical resolution of the computation. The time integration uses a third-order Adams-Bashforth scheme; the typical time step is Δt = 4  ×  10- 6  s. Our vortex reconnection procedure guarantees that a small amount of vortex length (as a proxy for kinetic energy) is lost at each reconnection, in agreement with numerical calculations of vortex reconnections performed using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [\cite=Leadbeater]. The reconnection procedure and the enforcement of the minimum distance Δξ provide the numerical dissipation mechanism which plays the rôle of phonon emission in actual 4He [\cite=Baggaley-cascade] (or of the Caroli-Matricon [\cite=Kopnin] mechanism in 3He-B). To cope with the large number N  ~  105 of discretization points along the vortex lines, we use a tree algorithm [\cite=Barnes] [\cite=Baggaley-density] [\cite=Baggaley-long] which reduces the CPU time needed to evaluate the Biot-Savart integrals from N2 to N log N. The initial condition consists of randomly oriented straight vortex lines, each carrying one quantum of circulation (however, we checked that results do not depend on the initial configuration of vortices). We find that the initial vortices interact and reconnect, and, after a transient of the order of 0.03  s, the vortex line density (vortex length per unit volume) saturates at the average value L = 7.9  ×  108  m- 2. The average curvature saturates too. The vortex tangle is shown in Figure [\ref=fig1]. By construction, the circulation of each vortex line is conserved, and each vortex moves exclusively due to the collective influences of all the other vortex lines; this represents an accurate model of quantum turbulence.

One of the most important quantity in theory of turbulence is the energy spectrum, E(k) defined by

[formula]

where E is the kinetic energy (per unit mass), V is volume, [formula], with [formula] the wave vector. Figure [\ref=fig2] shows a spectrum typical of quantum turbulence. The Biot-Savart interactions of vortex lines over length scales larger than the average inter-vortex distance [formula] has induced the same Kolmogorov energy spectrum E(k)  ~  k- 5 / 3 (for [formula]) which is observed in ordinary turbulence . The Kolmogorov spectrum was also observed in experiments with turbulent superfluid helium [\cite=Tabeling] [\cite=Grenoble], and in calculations performed with both the vortex filament model [\cite=Tsubota-vd] [\cite=Baggaley-density] and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [\cite=Nore] [\cite=Tsubota-GP]. At larger wavenumbers the spectrum becomes shallower due to the Kelvin-wave cascade along individual vortex lines [\cite=Baggaley-cascade] [\cite=Kozik] [\cite=Lvov], in agreement with Refs. [\cite=Tsubota-vd] [\cite=Sasa]. The Kelvin cascade (which is not the main concern in this work) is due to the nonlinear interaction of Kelvin waves (helical perturbations of vortex filaments). It transfers kinetic energy downscale, creating shorter and shorter waves, until, at very short length scales, phonon emission turns the kinetic energy of the waves into the sound energy. (In 3He-B, the dissipation in the zero-temperature limit is likely to be associated with a different, Caroli-Matricon mechanism of energy loss from Kelvin waves into the quasiparticle bound states.) In our calculation, a small numerical dissipation arising from the discretization and the vortex reconnection procedure plays the role of phonon emission [\cite=Baggaley-cascade]. If we continued the calculation for a longer time, this numerical dissipation would make the vortex length to decay, but the energy and the length can be considered effectively constant over the timescale of interest here.

To highlight the presence of any structure in the vortex tangle shown in Figure [\ref=fig1], we convolve our discrete vortex filaments with a Gaussian kernel, and define a smoothed vorticity field [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit vector along a vortex at the discretization point [formula], and the smoothing length σ is of the order of [formula]. We test that, under this smoothing operation, a collection of randomly oriented vortex lines whose separation is of the order of [formula] yields [formula]; conversely, an organized bundle of vortex filaments of the same circulation yields a smooth vorticity distribution. Because of the wigglyness of the vortex lines at short lengthscales created by the Kelvin cascade, we also test the smoothing procedure on vortex lines after adding ten helical waves with an imposed k- 7 / 5 Kelvin-wave amplitude spectrum, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig3].

Figure [\ref=fig4] shows the smoothed vorticity corresponding to Figure [\ref=fig1]: vortical 'worms', such as those seen in numerical simulations of ordinary turbulence, are clearly visible.

This is clear evidence of three-dimensional coherent superfluid vortex structures at T = 0 which arise simply by the fundamental equation of motion ([\ref=eq1]) of vortex dynamics. There have been reports on the existence of vortex bundles [\cite=Kivotides] [\cite=Morris] in Biot-Savart simulations of quantum turbulence at relatively high temperatures, [formula], where thermal excitations form a viscous normal fluid component which interacts with the vortex lines via the mutual friction force. However, in this finite-temperature regime, vortical structures belong to the normal turbulent fluid, and the friction force [\cite=Hulton] would naturally induce superfluid bundles around them (although their stability is an open question). Here we focus on the development of vortical bundles in the perfect superfluid, as a consequence of pure incompressible Euler dynamics. An intermittent vortex structure has also been noticed in a recent [\cite=Sasa] Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of turbulence in a Bose-Einstein condensate. However, in their calculation the vortex cores were (typically of a Bose-Einstein condensate, either realized numerically or in the laboratory) very close to each other: [formula] to 9, in contrast to our much larger [formula] typical of 4He and 3He-B superfluids; compressible effects (rapid density changes near vortex cores, sound waves, and the application of artificial damping which affects vortex positions) which are absent in our (incompressible) Biot-Savart model were also likely to have played a rôle.

To verify that the structures in Figure [\ref=fig4] are indeed bundles of quantized vortices, we show in Figure [\ref=fig5] a two-dimensional cross-section of the z-component of the smoothed vorticity [formula] in the z = 0 plane of Figure [\ref=fig4]. We overlay the intersections of vortex filaments with the plane z = 0 distinguishing the sign of ωz. It is apparent that the smoothed vortical structures shown in Figure [\ref=fig4] are indeed small bundles of aligned vortex filaments, which appear as small clusters of positive and negative vorticity. There are typically 2 to 5 vortex points in each cluster.

It is important to check that the vortex bundles are physically distinct coherent structures of a well-defined scale, rather than just a part of a purely random distribution, which would also contain structures of any scale which would become prominent after averaging. Clustering in any two-dimensional system of points (or of any other discrete objects) can be confirmed and quantified using Ripley's K-function [\cite=Ripley], or, alternatively, Besag's L-function [\cite=Besag]. These functions, frequently used in applied statistics, were also used to detect spatial correlations in two-dimensional physical systems (in particular in Monte-Carlo simulations and also in biological applications of the Ising model). Ripley's K-function is defined as

[formula]

where M is the number of points within the area A = D2 (with D the size of the domain), di,j is the distance between points i and j, and the I(x) is unity if the condition x is satisfied and zero otherwise. However, the related Besag's function is more convenient for our purposes, defined as

[formula]

L = 0 means complete spatial randomness, L < 0 implies dispersion, and L > 0 aggregation (clustering). We show in Figure [\ref=fig6] Besag's function for a large collection of two-dimensional cross-sections of Figure [\ref=fig4]. The result confirms that vortex points of the same sign tend to cluster, hence the vortex bundles of Figure [\ref=fig4] represent distinct physical entities rather than merely an element of a purely random distribution of vorticity.

We now proceed with the interpretation of our results, paying particular attention to the relation to the ordinary turbulence. According to our calculations, parallel vortex lines tend to come together locally, forming clusters of vortex filaments of the same circulation in any cross-section through the flow. If the vorticity distribution was two-dimensional, the well-known inverse enstrophy cascade of the two-dimensional turbulence would transfer vorticity to large scales, creating large-scale regions populated by vortices of the same sign. The two-dimensional inverse cascade is due to the conservation of the enstrophy, [formula], the second invariant of the Euler equation in two dimensions. In three dimensions, only the first integral exists, the kinetic energy [formula], whose conservation results in the direct cascade of the energy to smaller scales in both two- and three-dimensional turbulent flows.

To find whether there is a link between formation of three-dimensional coherent structures and tendency of vortices to cluster in two dimensions we performed additional numerical experiments. The two-dimensional system of interacting point vortices in the inviscid fluid was introduced by Onsager [\cite=Onsager] in 1949, and is known as the Onsager point-vortex gas. This is where the concept of inverse cascade was born. Onsager found that, statistically, the states of the two-dimensional system corresponding to the formation of large-scale coherent structures (clusters of point vortices of the same polarity) formally have negative temperature (a detailed analysis was later provided by Montgomery [\cite=Montgomery]). The ordering of vortices and the properties of the inverse cascade in the point-vortex gas have been extensively studied, with the numerical study of the formation of large-scale circulation patterns in the two-dimensional periodic domain by Montgomery and Joyce [\cite=Montgomery-Joyce] being one of the first studies of this kind. Recently some of the authors of the present report demonstrated [\cite=Wang] the clustering of point vortices of the same polarity in a small system of just a few hundred vortices, by computing the dis balance between the vortices and antivortices within subdomains of the periodic two-dimensional computational domain. Here we have simulated the evolution of a much larger number (10,000) of point vortices in two dimensions. The system evolves from a statistically uniform state with zero net circulation where the number of vortices equals that of antivortices. Using Besag's function, we have confirmed quantitatively the non-random clustering of vortex points.

To check if coherent structures discussed above could be a fossil of the two-dimensional reverse cascade that survives in three dimensions, we explored a modified two-dimensional Onsager's system of point vortices similar to that shown in Figure [\ref=fig5]. We modelled the vortex motion out of the plane by removing randomly chosen vortex-antivortex pairs from the plane at a certain rate, and then randomly re-introducing them at random positions elsewhere in the plane. For example, if a moving vortex loop in three dimensions crosses the plane, the number of point vortices in the plane first increases by two, and then is reduced by two as the loop leaves the plane. As these disturbances violate the local enstrophy conservation, they can be used to model, in a heuristic manner, local three-dimensional effects. We found that Besag's function in such a disturbed two-dimensional system still shows tendency to clustering typical of the inverse enstrophy cascade, but weaker than in the pure two-dimensional case. The (positive) value of Besag's function depends on the rate of vortex removal. It is therefore likely that the two-dimensional tendency to cluster is limited by the fact that the enstrophy is not constant, but this tendency is not entirely suppressed entirely.

When interpreting our results, it is also useful to compare them with recent calculations of Numasato et al. [\cite=Numasato], who observed only the direct energy cascade in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These authors solved the Gross-Pitaevskii equation; this model allows vortex reconnections, hence does not conserve the number of vortices (i.e., the enstrophy). These authors also argued that the Gross-Pitaevskii model is compressible (the condensate's density vanishes at the vortex axes and large-scale sound waves are easily excited, as noticed by White et al. [\cite=White]), and the compressibility alone could explain the lack of the inverse cascade. Can compressibility be equally important in our case? As we already noted above, in a typical atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, either realized numerically or in the laboratory, the distance between the vortices, [formula], is only a few times larger than the vortex core radius a0, while [formula] in the superfluid helium. Therefore, compressibility is less likely to prevent the formation of coherent structures in the superfluid turbulence.

In the ordinary turbulence, the origin of coherent vorticity structures is often attributed to the roll-up of vortex sheets by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability [\cite=Vincent-Meneguzzi1994]. The superfluid turbulence considered here has no vortex sheets, so the coherent structures observed here seem to involve a different mechanism.

Our future work will explore if the number of vortex lines in the bundles increases as the circulation is reduced (with kinetic energy fixed), as one expects that the limit h  →  0 should yield the classical behaviour where the range of vorticity values in coherent structures is wider than that observed in our numerical experiments. To better understand the dynamics of coherent structures, we also plan to investigate the time evolution of Ripley's and Besag's functions for the three-dimensional vortex tangle and to explore the time correlations of the flow.

In summary, our numerical experiments with very intense quantum turbulence at absolute zero have revealed that the vortex tangle contains coherent vortical structures, or bundles of vortex lines, which arise from the Biot-Savart dynamics alone, and appear to be similar to the vorticity 'worms' observed in the ordinary turbulence. This result sheds new light on the relation between the ordinary and quantum turbulent flows, suggesting that their connection can be deeper than usually assumed. Given the relative simplicity of the quantum turbulence, this may provide new insights into the nature of turbulence.
