Introduction

The main purpose of the present paper is to continue the investigations in [\cite=1], [\cite=2], [\cite=3]. We study a class of Riemannian manifolds which admits a circulant metric g and an additional circulant structure q. The forth degree of structure q is an identity, and q is a parallel structure with respect to the Riemannian connection [formula] of g.

Preliminaries

We consider a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold M with a metric g and an affinor structure q. We note the local coordinates of g and q are circulant matrices. The next conditions and results have been discussed in [\cite=3].

The metric g have the coordinates:

[formula]

in the local coordinate system (x1,x2,x3,x4), and A = A(p),B = B(p),C = C(p), where p(x1,x2,x3,x4)∈F  ⊂  R4. Naturally, A,B,C are smooth functions of a point p. We calculate that det gij = (A - C)2((A + C)2 - 4B2)  ≠  0.

Further, let the local coordinates of q be

[formula]

We will use the notation [formula] for every smooth function Φ defined in F.

We know from [\cite=3] that the following identities are true

[formula]

[formula]

where E is the unit matrix;

[formula]

Now, let w = (x,y,z,u) be a vector in χM. Using ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=3]) we calculate that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let M be the Riemannian manifold with a metric g and an affinor structure q, defined by ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=3]), respectively. Let w(x,y,z,u) be no eigenvector on TpM( i.e. w(x,y,z,u)  ≠  (x,x,x,x), w(x,y,z,u)  ≠  (x, - x,x, - x) ). If φ is the angle between x and qx, and φ is the angle between x and q2x, then we have [formula] [formula] φ∈(0,π), φ∈(0,π).

We apply ([\ref=6]), ([\ref=7]) and ([\ref=8]) in the above equations and we get

[formula]

Almost conformal transformation in M

Let M satisfies ([\ref=1])- ([\ref=5*]). We note fij = gikqktqtj, i.e.

[formula]

We calculate det fij = (C - A)2((A + C)2 - 4B2)  ≠  0, so we accept fij for local coordinates of another metric f. The metric fij is necessarily undefined. Further, we suppose α and β are two smooth functions in F  ⊂  R4 and we construct the metric [formula], as follows:

[formula]

We say that equation ([\ref=12]) define an almost conformal transformation, noting that if β = 0 then ([\ref=12]) implies the case of the classical conformal transformation in M [\cite=2].

From ([\ref=1]), ([\ref=3]), ([\ref=11]) and ([\ref=12]) we get the local coordinates of [formula]:

[formula]

We see that fij and ij are both circulant matrices.

[\cite=3] Let M be a Riemannian manifold with a metric g from ([\ref=1]) and an affinor structure q from ([\ref=3]). Let [formula] be the Riemannian connection of g. Then [formula] if and only if, when

[formula]

Let M be a Riemannian manifold with a metric g from ([\ref=1]) and an affinor structure q from ([\ref=3]). Also, let [formula] be a metric of M, defined by ([\ref=12]). Let [formula] and [formula] be the corresponding connections of g and [formula], and [formula]. Then q = 0 if and only if, when

[formula]

At first we suppose ([\ref=14]) is valid. Using ([\ref=14]) and ([\ref=13*]) we can verify that the following identity is true:

[formula]

The identity ([\ref=15]) is analogue to ([\ref=13*]), and consequently we conclude q = 0.

Inversely, if q = 0 then analogously to ([\ref=13*]) we have ([\ref=15]). Now, ([\ref=13*]) and ([\ref=15]) imply the system

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=ur1]) we find the only solution α  =  β.q2, and from ([\ref=ur2]) we get the only solution β =  - β.q2. So the theorem is proved.

Let [formula] be the metric given by ([\ref=12]). If 0  <  β  <  α and g is positively defined, then [formula] is also positively defined.

From the condition (α  -  β)(A  -  C)  >  0 we get αA + βC  >  βA  +  αC  >  0. Also, we see that βA  +  αC > (α  +  β)B  >  0 and finely (αA + βC) > βA  +  αC > (α  +  β)B  >  0. Analogously to ([\ref=5*]) we state that [formula] is positively defined.

Let w = w(x(p),y(p),z(p),u(p)) be in TpM, p∈M, qw  ≠  w, q2w  ≠  w and g and [formula] be the metrics of M, related by ([\ref=12]). Then we have:

[formula]

Let w = w(x(p),y(p),z(p),u(p)) be a vector in TpM, p∈M, qw  ≠  w, q2w  ≠  w. Let g and [formula] be two positively defined metrics of M, related by ([\ref=12]). If φ and φ1 are the angles between w and qw, with respect to g and [formula], φ and φ1 are the angles between w and q2w, with respect to g and [formula], then the following equations are true:

[formula]

[formula]

Since g and [formula] are both positively defined metrics we can calculate cos φ and cos φ1, respectively. Then by using ([\ref=13]) and ([\ref=191]) we get ([\ref=18]). Also, we calculate cos φ and cos φ1, respectively. Then by using ([\ref=13]) and ([\ref=191]) we get ([\ref=19]).

Theorem [\ref=t4] implies immediately the assertions:

Let φ and φ1 be the angles between w and qw with respect to g and [formula]. Let φ and φ1 be the angles between w and q2w with respect to g and [formula] Then

1)[formula] if and only if when [formula] ;

2)if [formula] then [formula]

3)if [formula] then [formula].

Further, we consider an infinite series of the metrics of M as follows: where

[formula]

By the method of the mathematical induction we can see that the matrix of every gn is circulant one and every gn is positively defined.

Let M be a Riemannian manifold with metrics gn from ([\ref=20]) and an affinor structure q from ([\ref=3]). Let w = w(x(p),y(p),z(p)) be in TpM, p∈M, qw  ≠  w, q2w  ≠  w. Let φn be the angle between w and qw, with respect to gn, let φn be the angle between w and q2w with respect to gn. Then the infinite series: is converge and lim φn = 0, is converge and lim φn = 0.

Using the method of the mathematical induction and Theorem [\ref=4] we obtain:

[formula]

as well as φn∈(0,π). From ([\ref=21*]) we get:

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=22*]) implies cos φn  ≥   cos φn - 1, so the series { cos φn} is increasing one and since cos φn  <  1 then it is converge. From ([\ref=21*]) we have lim  cos φn = 1, so lim φn = 0.

Now, we find

[formula]

as well as φn∈(0,π). From ([\ref=21]) we get:

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=22]) implies cos φn  >   cos φn - 1, so the series { cos φn} is increasing one and since cos φn  <  1 then it is converge. From ([\ref=21]) we have lim  cos φn = 1, so lim φn = 0.
