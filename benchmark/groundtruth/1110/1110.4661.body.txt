Deformations of crystal frameworks

Keywords: periodic frameworks, deformations, flexibility, silica polymorphs.

Introduction

In this paper we present specific applications of our general deformation theory of periodic frameworks [\cite=BS].

Considerations related to framework flexibility appear already in the early structural investigations based on X-ray crystallography [\cite=G1] [\cite=G2] [\cite=P1] [\cite=P2]. For framework materials, envisaged as corner sharing polyhedra, an intuitive notion of a 'coordinated tilting' of the polyhedra is used in classifying similar structures [\cite=Gla] [\cite=M] or in studies of thermal and pressure effects. A most important area of theoretical and experimental studies where geometric models of deforming frameworks have been implicated is that concerned with displacive phase transitions [\cite=GD] [\cite=Dol] [\cite=D].

Regarding the use of geometrical facts, it should be observed that, for most framework structures, only a confined sample of geometrical possibilities has been explored in the literature, typically one-parameter families which are intuitively 'accessible'. The deformation theory developed in our paper [\cite=BS] shows that one may expect, in general, a rich and diverse geometry. The present undertaking describes the deformation spaces for tetrahedral periodic frameworks modeled on quartz, cristobalite and tridymite.

The quartz framework

The ideal structure considered here is made of congruent regular tetrahedra. The oxygen atoms would correspond with the vertices, each oxygen being shared by two tetrahedra. The silicon atoms should be imagined at the centers of the tetrahedra. We shall examine all the geometric deformations of the periodic framework described in Figure [\ref=FigQ], without concern for self-collision or any prohibition of a physical nature.

Equivalence under Euclidean motions is eliminated by assuming the tetrahedron marked A0A1A2A3 as fixed. Since all edges maintain their length, the positions of the two tetrahedra which share the vertices A0 and A1 are completely described by two orthogonal transformations R0, respectively R1 as follows: R0 fixes A0 and takes Ai to Bi, i  ≠  0, while R1 fixes A1 and takes Aj to Cj, j  ≠  1. The figure, by depicting only the 'visible' edges, implies that both R0 and R1 are orientation reversing, that is, as orthogonal matrices - R0, - R1∈SO(3).

If we denote the edge vectors Ai - A0 by ei,i = 1,2,3, we have:

It follows that the dependency condition of a zero sum for these four generators of the periodicity lattice takes the form

[formula]

Under our regularity assumptions, the three vectors R1(e1 - e2 - e3), R0(e1 - e2 - e3) and (e1 + e2 - e3) have the same length and form an equilateral triangle. This restricts R0(e1 - e2 - e3) to the circle on the sphere of radius ||e1 - e2 - e3|| (which corresponde with an angle of 2π / 3 with e1 + e2 - e3). Thus, - R0∈SO(3) is constrained to a surface, which is differentiably a two-torus (S1)2.

For each choice of - R0 on this torus, R1(e1 - e2 - e3) is determined by ([\ref=0sum]), hence - R1 is restricted to a circle S1 in SO(3). It follows that

The deformation space of the ideal quartz framework is given by a three dimensional torus (S1)3 minus the degenerate cases when the span of the four vectors is less than three dimensional.

The cristobalite framework

The case of the 'ideal β cristobalite' structure illustrated in Figure [\ref=FigC] is already covered in [\cite=BS]. The periodicity group of the framework is give by all the translational symmetries of the ideal crystal framework. As a result, there are n = 4 orbits of vertices and m = 12 orbits of edges.

Adopting the notations of Figure [\ref=FigCC], we may assume the tetrahedron Os1s2s3 as fixed and parametrize the possible positions of the other tetrahedon by a rotation around the origin O.

The deformation space of the ideal high cristobalite framework is naturally parametrized by the open set in SO(3) where the depicted generators remain linearly independent.

The tridymite framework

The tetrahedral framework (G,Γ) of tridymite is depicted in Figure [\ref=FigT]. We consider the ideal case made of regular tetrahedra. The quotient graph has |V / Γ| = 8 and |E / Γ| = 24. All deformations can be described by three orthogonal transformations (matrices) R0,R1,R2 acting with centers at O,O1 and respectively O2. With O as the origin and the tetrahedron OD1E1O1 assumed fixed, we put:

[formula]

Then, our orthogonal transformations are determined by the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

As a result, the two linear dependence relations between the six depicted periods take the form:

[formula]

where I denotes the identity. We note that the ideal high tridymite structure (the aristotype) corresponds to R0 =  - I and R1 = R2 the reflection in the plane span(f1,f2)).

We shall describe the deformation space in a neighbourhood of this high tridymite structure. We put - R0 = Q, R1 = Q1 and - R2R0 = Q2, so that ([\ref=Tdepend]) becomes

[formula]

with Q, - Q1, - Q2∈SO(3). Since the orthogonal transformations Q,Q1,Q2 are completely determined by their values on two vectors e1,e2 of a Cartesian frame with span(e1,e2) = span(f1,f2), we have to solve the system

[formula]

where we assume Q∈SO(3) given in a neighbourhood of the identity, and look for solutions Q1,Q2.

We may interpret this system as a problem about a spherical four-bar mechanism in the following way. All the vectors implicated in ([\ref=Tsystem]) are unit vectors and can be depicted as points on the unit sphere S2. For a given Q, we mark by Mi the midpoint of the spherical geodesic segment

[formula]

. This is illustrated in Figure [\ref=FigS].

It is an elementary observation that any solution Q1ei and Q2ei determines diameters of the corresponding circles for i = 1,2, with the two geodesic arcs

[formula]

and

[formula]

. Thus, there are four configurations with the prescribed distance.

We observe that if we replace Q1 by Q2 and Q2 by Q1 in the labeling of the vertices of a realization, the orientation is reversed, hence the configuration belongs to the other component. Thus, the two obvious solutions of ([\ref=Tsystem]), namely

[formula]

correspond with configurations on the two different loop components, as do the remaining two, which are also paired by relabeling. This discussion shows that all four solutions are obtained from the quadrilateral e1,Qe1,Qe2,e2 and its reflection in the geodesic

[formula]

marked as rA1,rB1,rB2,rA2. Then,, the solutions (Q1e1,Q1e2,Q2e1,Q2e2) of the system ([\ref=Tsystem]) are the following four solutions: (A1,A2,B1,B2), (B1,B2,A1,A2), (rA1,rA2,rB1,rB2) and (rB1,rB2,rA1,rA2).

We may summarize our result as follows.

The deformation space of the tridymite framework is singular in a neighbourhood of the aristotype and can be represented as a ramified covering with four sheets of a three-dimensional domain. There is a natural Z2  ×  Z2 action on this covering which fixes the aristotype framework.

Indeed, the two involutions, inverting the labeling and reflecting in
