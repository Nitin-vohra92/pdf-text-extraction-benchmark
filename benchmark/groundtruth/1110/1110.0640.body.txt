Motivation

The study presented here is a part of the development of the fully exclusive next-to-leading order (NLO) Parton Shower Monte Carlo (MC) for precision QCD predictions for the LHC experiments, see [\cite=Jadach:2010ew] [\cite=Jadach:2011kc] [\cite=Jadach:2011cr]. DGLAP [\cite=DGLAP] evolution of parton distribution functions (PDFs) is modelled in the Monte Carlo within the unintegrated phase space. A methodology based on the collinear factorisation theorems in physical gauge based on refs. [\cite=Ellis:1978sf] and [\cite=Curci:1980uw] is used. The MC program will simulate exactly NLO DGLAP evolution of PDFs by itself, as opposed to using pretabulated PDFs, provided by the non-MC programs like QCDNUM [\cite=Botje:2010ay]. For the construction of such a new NLO parton shower MC program a new exclusive (fully unintegrated) NLO evolution kernels are required in order to impose NLO corrections, by means of reweighting the LO distribution, as outlined in ref. [\cite=Jadach:2011cr]. In this method LO MC parton shower has to be reconstructed from the scratch, contrary to methodology of ref. [\cite=Frixione:2002ik], where at the price of MC weights being non-positive, one is able to use standard LO parton shower MC.

Very schematically, the corresponding MC weight reads:

[formula]

The potential problem is that a single Feynman diagram, or small subset of diagrams, entering the exclusive NLO kernel (and the MC weight) generally is not gauge-invariant and may feature uncancelled soft singularities. The Monte Carlo weights may then explode, unless the crude distribution of the LO MC already reproduces exactly soft singularities of NLO diagrams. It is therefore very important to understand in fine detail the structure of soft and collinear singularities in exclusive kernels, as implemented in the LO MC and also including complete NLO corrections.

For the purpose of the MC we are going to analyse the example diagrams and their groups one by one, gaining the detailed knowledge about the structure of collinear and soft singularities of each Feynman diagram contributing to the NLO kernel and the interplay between diagrams. We shall exploit tools and methods of the graphical analysis of the infra-red singularities which were already used for the non-singlet diagrams in ref. [\cite=Slawinska:2009gn]. Here, we will extend this study to a gauge invariant subset of two-real singlet diagrams contributing to the Pgq NLO DGLAP kernel. Let us stress that the cancellations discussed in the following are not of the usual KLN [\cite=KLN] nature, i.e. between the real and virtual Feynman diagrams, but rather among the real diagrams alone, and are governed by the spin and colour quantum numbers. The contributions of the diagrams to the standard DGLAP (inclusive) kernels analysed in the following have been already defined and used in refs. [\cite=Furmanski:1980cm] and [\cite=Ellis:1996nn]. Generally, we shall examine the structure of the soft and collinear singularities of the unintegrated distributions related to these NLO DGLAP evolution kernels.

Singlet diagrams considered

The singlet diagrams considered in this contribution originate from the LO amplitude for splitting a gluon into a quark (antiquark)

by means of adding the NLO corrections from the emission of an additional gluon:

Feynman diagrams contributing to the NLO kernel result from squaring the above sum of amplitudes and are displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:singlet]. It is worth noting, that the ladder diagrams (the first and the third in the upper row in Fig. [\ref=fig:singlet]) enter the NLO kernel supplemented with the so called collinear counterterms that subtract off the leading-order contributions. In this contribution, however, the counterterms will be included only at the end of the analysis, and before that the leading-order singularities will be visible.

We will adopt the same approach as in ref. [\cite=Slawinska:2009gn] and analyse all distributions in the logarithmic Sudakov variables ( ln (a1 / a2), ln (α1  /  α2)), where αi come from the Sudakov parametrisation of four-momenta of the emitted particles: [formula] and ai are angular (rapidity-related) variables, [formula], i = 1,2. All contributions are normalised to the eikonal phase space:

[formula]

with the angles integrated over and terms of order O(ε) neglected. Moreover, we will ensure that at least one emission is hard by constraining α1  +  α2  =  1 - x  >  0. Similarly, the maximal angle is fixed to an arbitrary parameter. Hence, the ratios a1 / a2 and α1  /  α2 will measure the relative hardness and angles of the two partons.

We will explore the soft limit of the diagrams in Fig. [\ref=fig:singlet], namely the limit where both [formula] and αi  →  0 (for a given i), but ai remains finite. In the logarithmic Sudakov variables the singularities will appear on the plots as one- or two-dimensional infinite structures.

Results

Let us first consider the C2F class of diagrams, corresponding to emission of a gluon from a quark. The bremsstrahlung type diagram is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:aCF2] (left). It has a doubly-logarithmic singularity visible as the infinite trapezoidal plateau, bordered by the lines α1  =  α2 and [formula] (the line of equal "lightcone minus variables" α-i). The second diagram, representing the amplitude-squared of the emission of a gluon from the emitted quark (Fig. [\ref=fig:aCF2], middle), features a collinear singularity manifesting itself as the infinite ridge along the line of equal angles. This singularity, however, is not related to the soft limit (it is compensated by the virtual diagram) and will not be considered here. This diagram has also a doubly-logarithmic singularity in the form of a triangular plateau, bordered by the lines of equal angles and "minus variables". The sum of the two (the rightmost plot in Fig. [\ref=fig:aCF2]) features two equal-height plateaux with the canyon at the line of equal minus variables.

The most singular terms from the distributions of the diagrams are necessarily proportional to the products of the leading-order DGLAP kernels:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where z1 = 1 - α1 and [formula]. Similarly:

[formula]

[formula]

where z1 = 1 - x and [formula].

In eqs. [\eqref=eq:Hgq] and [\eqref=eq:Hv] we also used [formula] (proportional to the denominator of the propagator of the most virtual quark) and a2  =  a21  +  a22  -  2a1a2 cos φ (proportional to the invariant mass of the emitted quark and gluon).

The "canyon" structure in the plot, being the remaining singly logarithmic singularity, however, spoils the soft limit regardless of the counterterm employed. If we add now the interference diagram, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:a+vCF2], the canyon gets removed.

What remains is the uniform plateau bordered by a1 = a2 collinear singularity. The "minus variable" ordering, preferred by each diagram separately, turns out to be irrelevant for the sum of diagrams!

From the above formulae it follows that the quadratic plateau represents the leading-order contribution. In the NLO kernel it is removed by the counterterm of the factorisation procedure proportional to

[formula]

The doubly logarithmic singularity of the counterterm depends on the details of factorisation procedure in use.

The CACF subset consists of diagrams that correspond to the emission of a gluon from the incoming gluon. They include only one amplitude-squared diagram. Displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:2lCFCA], left, it has a doubly-logarithmic singularity - the plateau stretching in the two regions: where the angle of the emitted gluon is larger than the quark's and vice versa. The diagram contributes in the region of phase space where both emissions are ordered in the minus variable. After adding the interference diagram, the boundaries of the resulting plateau are corrected and the sum contributes in the region of the phase-space, where the angle of the quark is larger than the angle of the gluon.

The collinear counterterm is given by:

[formula]

While the C2F counterterm of eq. [\eqref=eq:3qgcounterterm] features the a1 < a2 ordering, the ordering in the CACF counterterm of eq. [\eqref=eq:q3gcounterterm] is the opposite (a2  <  a1) due to a gluon being emitted before a quark.

The remaining CACF interferences feature single-log singularities, seen as infinite canyons/ridges along the line of equal minus-variables in Fig. [\ref=fig:1lCFCA] that cancell out when added. What remains is the little hill in the central region, which leads to a finite contribution.

The sum of all singlet diagrams discussed in this contribution is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:allplot]. The left-hand-side plot in this figure shows two leading-order plateaux separated by the line of equal angles a1  =  a2. The line represents a collinear singularity and comes from the diagram, in which the additional gluon is emitted from the emitted quark. The plateau on the left (in brown) corresponds to the topologies in which a soft gluon is emitted from a quark. The right-hand-side plateau (navy-blue) represents contributions with a soft gluon emitted from the incoming gluon. The relative height of both plateaux is equal to C2F / CFCA, as expected.

In the right plot the same sum is presented, but with the leading order singularities cancelled out by the factorisation counterterms of eqs. [\eqref=eq:3qgcounterterm] and [\eqref=eq:q3gcounterterm] on the left- and right-hand-side of this plot, respectively. The plot features the collinear singularity only.

Conclusions

We conclude that the restoration of gauge invariance (colour coherence) is crucial in cancelling infra-red singularities. We understand the soft limits of NLO exclusive kernels, observe and explain the cancellations of double- and single-logarithmic soft singularities. The angular ordering is the preferred parametrisation of the phase space in view of the soft singularity structure of the distributions from gauge-invariant subset of diagrams contributing to NLO evolution kernels in the exclusive (unintegrated) form.
