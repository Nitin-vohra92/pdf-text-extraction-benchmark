Increasing stability in an inverse problem for the acoustic equation

Introduction

In this paper we study the issue of stability for determining the refractive index in the acoustic equation by boundary measurements. It is well known that this inverse problem is ill-posed. However, one anticipates that the stability will increase if one increases the frequency. This phenomenon was observed numerically in the inverse obstacle scattering problem [\cite=CHP]. Several rigorous justifications of the increasing stability phenomena in different settings were obtained by Isakov et al [\cite=HI] [\cite=I07] [\cite=I11] [\cite=ASI07] [\cite=ASI10]. Especially, in [\cite=I11], Isakov considered the Helmholtz equation with a potential

[formula]

He obtained stability estimates of determining q by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for different ranges of k's. All of these results demonstrate the increasing stability phenomena in k. For the case of the inverse source problem for Helmholtz equation and an homogeneous background it was shown in [\cite=BLT] that the ill-posedness of the inverse problem decreases as the frequency increases.

In this paper, we study the acoustic wave equation. Let [formula] be a bounded domain, where n  ≥  3. Let ∂Ω be smooth. We consider the equation

[formula]

where the real-valued q(x) is the refractive index. Assume that the kernel of the operator Δ + k2q(x) on H10(Ω) is trivial. Associated with [\eqref=eq:eq], we define the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN map) Λ:H1 / 2(∂Ω)  →  H- 1 / 2(∂Ω) by

[formula]

where u is the solution to ([\ref=eq:eq]) with the Dirichlet condition u  =  f on ∂Ω, and ν is the unit outer normal vector of ∂Ω. The uniqueness of this inverse problem is well known [\cite=SU]. This inverse problem is notoriously ill-posed. For this aspect, Alessandrini proved that the stability estimate for this problem is of log type [\cite=A88] and Mandache showed that the log type stability is optimal [\cite=Ma]. In this paper, we would like to focus on how the stability behaves when the frequency k increases. Now we state the main result.

Assume that q1(x) and q2(x) are two sound speeds with associated DN maps Λ1 and Λ2, respectively. Let s  >  (n / 2)  +  1, M  >  0. Suppose [formula] (l  =  1,2) and [formula]. Denote [formula] a zero extension of q1  -  q2. Then there exists a constant C1, depending only on n, s, and Ω, such that if k2  ≥  1 / (C1M) and [formula] then

[formula]

holds, where C > 0 depends only on n,s,Ω,M and [formula]. Here [formula] is the operator norm from H1 / 2(∂Ω) into H- 1 / 2(∂Ω).

1. The estimate [\eqref=iest] consists two parts - Lipschitz and logarithmic estimates. As k increases, the logarithmic part decreases and the Lipschitz part becomes dominated. In other words, the ill-posedness is alleviated when k is large.

2. We would like to remark on the constant C exp (Ck2) / k2 appearing in the Lipschitz part of [\eqref=iest]. 1 / k2 comes from k2q in the equation, which appears naturally, while, exp (Ck2) is due to the fact that we use the complex geometrical optics solutions in the proof. Even so, we expect that the there is an exponential growth of the constant with frequency since we do not assume any geometrical restriction on q(x) other than regularity. For the wave equation it has been shown by Burq for the obstacle problem [\cite=B] that the local energy decay is log-slow and this is due to the presence of trapped rays. Notice that in our case we can have trapped rays. For the case of simple sound speeds we expect that there is no exponential increase in the constant. In [\cite=StU] a Hölder stability estimate was obtained for the hyperbolic DN map for generic simple metrics. For very general metrics there is not known modulus of continuity for the hyperbolic DN map, see [\cite=AKKLT] for convergence results.

However, in practice, k is fixed and so is the constant. Therefore, one should expect to obtain a better resolution of q from boundary measurements when the chosen k is large.

3. Unlike the result in [\cite=I11] (for equation [\eqref=eq0]) where the stability estimates were derived in different ranges of k, estimate [\eqref=iest] is valid for all range of k provided k2  ≥  1 / (C1M) .

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm] makes use of Alessandrini's arguments [\cite=A88] and the CGO solutions constructed in [\cite=SU]. The main task is to keep track of how k appears in the proof of the stability estimates.

Complex geometrical optics solutions

In this section, we construct CGO solutions to the equation ([\ref=eq:eq]) by using the idea in [\cite=SU]. The main point is to express the dependence of constants on k explicitly. We first state two easy consequences from the results in [\cite=SU].

Let s  ≥  0 be an integer. Let ε0  >  0. Let [formula] satisfy ξ  ·  ξ  =  0 and [formula]. Then for any f∈Hs(Ω) there exists w∈Hs(Ω) such that w is a solution to

[formula]

and satisfies the estimate

[formula]

where a positive constant C0 depends only on n,s,ε0 and Ω.

By using this lemma, we can obtain a solution to the equation

[formula]

satisfying some decaying property as in the following lemma.

Let s  >  n / 2 be an integer. Let ε0  >  0. Let [formula] satisfy ξ  ·  ξ  =  0 and [formula]. Let f,g∈Hs(Ω). Then there exists C1  >  0 depending only on n,s,ε0 and Ω such that if

[formula]

then there exists a solution ψ∈Hs(Ω) to the equation ([\ref=eq:SUtheorem23alphaeq]) satisfying the estimate

[formula]

where C0 is the positive constant in Lemma [\ref=lemma:SUprop21alpha].

The needed CGO solutions are constructed as follows.

Let s  >  n / 2 be an integer. Let ε0  >  0. Let [formula] satisfy ξ  ·  ξ  =  0 and [formula]. Define the constants C0 and C1 as in Lemma [\ref=lemma:SUtheorem23alpha]. Then if

[formula]

then there exists a solution u to the equation ([\ref=eq:eq]) with the form of

[formula]

where ψ has the estimate

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=eq:CGOform]) into ([\ref=eq:eq]), we have

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma:SUtheorem23alpha], we obtain this proposition.

Proof of stability estimate

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm]. We begin with Alessandrini's identity.

Let ul be a solution to ([\ref=eq:eq]) with q  =  ql, then we have

[formula]

Now we would like to estimate the Fourier transform of the difference of two q's. We denote F(f) the Fourier transformation of a function f.

Let s  >  (n / 2)  +  1 be an integer and M  >  0. Assume [formula], [formula] and k2  ≥  1  /  C1M, where C1 is the constant defined in Lemma [\ref=lemma:SUtheorem23alpha] corresponding to ε0  =  1. Let [formula] be a zero extension of q1  -  q2 and a0  ≥  C1. Suppose that χ∈C∞0(Ω) satisfies [formula] near [formula]. Then for r  ≥  0 and [formula] with [formula] the following statements hold: if 0  ≤  r  ≤  a0k2M then

[formula]

holds; if r  ≥  C1k2M then

[formula]

holds, where C > 0 depends only on n,s and Ω.

In the following proof, the letter C stands for a general constant depending only on n,s and Ω. By Proposition [\ref=prop:CGO], we can construct CGO solutions ul(x) to the equation ([\ref=eq:eq]) with q  =  ql having the form of

[formula]

for l  =  1,2, and we have

[formula]

from Proposition [\ref=prop:identity], where ψl satisfies

[formula]

if [formula] satisfies ξl  ·  ξl  =  0, [formula] and

[formula]

We remark that [formula] also holds. Indeed, we have

[formula]

Now, let r  ≥  0, and [formula] satisfy [formula]. We assume that [formula] satisfy

[formula]

Define ξ1 and ξ2 as

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Hence by ([\ref=eq:identityCGO]), we immediately obtain that

[formula]

provided [formula] and ([\ref=eq:xil]) are satisfied. We first estimate the first term on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:Fourierqtilde1] by

[formula]

since and s  >  n / 2.

On the other hand, by taking R large enough such that Ω  ⊂  BR(0), we have

[formula]

Likewise, we can get that

[formula]

since s - 1  >  n / 2. Consequently, we have

[formula]

Therefore, we can estimate the second term of the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:Fourierqtilde1]) by

[formula]

Summing up, we have shown that for r  >  0 and for [formula] with [formula] if we take α and ζ satisfying the conditions ([\ref=eq:kzeta]), [formula] and

[formula]

then

[formula]

holds.

Now assume that [formula] and k2  ≥  1  /  C1M. Thus if

[formula]

holds, then ([\ref=eq:zeta]) and [formula] are satisfied. Pick a0  ≥  C1. We first consider the case where 0  ≤  r  ≤  a0k2M. By choosing α and ζ satisfying

[formula]

both ([\ref=eq:kzeta]) and ([\ref=eq:zetaM]) are then satisfied since a0  ≥  C1. Hence we obtain ([\ref=eq:Fouriersummingup]), that is ([\ref=eq:lowerFourierestimate]). On the other hand, when r  ≥  C1k2M, we can choose α  =  0, η  ·  ζ  =  0 and [formula]. Then ([\ref=eq:kzeta]), ([\ref=eq:zetaM]) are satisfied and thus ([\ref=eq:Fouriersummingup]) holds and consequently ([\ref=eq:higherFourierestimate]) is valid.

Now we prove our main result.

As above, C denotes a general constant depending only on n,s and Ω. Written in polar coordinates, we have

[formula]

where a0  ≥  C1 and T  ≥  a0k2M are parameters which will be chosen later. Here C1 is the constant given in Lemma [\ref=lemma:Fourierest]. From now on, we take k2  ≥  1 / (C1M).

Our task now is to estimate each integral separately. We begin with I3. Since , q1  -  q2∈Hs0(Ω), and s  >  n / 2, we have that

[formula]

for ε  >  0, where m: = 2s  -  n.

On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Fourierest], we can estimate

[formula]

where χ∈C∞0(Ω) satisfies [formula] near [formula] and [formula]. In view of

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=i123]-[\eqref=i2] gives

[formula]

where positive constants C2 and C3 depend only on n,s and Ω.

Now we pick a0 and ε as

[formula]

(if needed, we take C2 large enough). We then obtain that

[formula]

for , where

[formula]

[formula], a: = 2C2CχM2 and C4  >  0 depends only on n,s and Ω.

To continue, we consider two cases:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where p will be determined later (see ([\ref=eq:p])).

For the first case ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmall]), our aim is to show that there exists T  ≥  ak2 such that

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim]) into ([\ref=eq:keyestimatewithT]) clearly implies ([\ref=iest]). Now to derive ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim]), it is enough to prove that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Remark that ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim2]) in equivalent to

[formula]

which holds if

[formula]

because of ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmall]). Setting T  =  p log (1 / A) (≥  ak2 by ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmall])), then ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim2b]) holds provided

[formula]

Now we turn to ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim1]). It is clear that ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim1]) is equivalent to

[formula]

since T  =  p log (1  /  A). It follows from ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmall]) that

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim1a]) is verified if we can show that

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

for log (1  /  A)  ≥  1. Now we choose

[formula]

Then ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim1b]) becomes

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

Hence if we choose C5 such that

[formula]

then ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim1c]) follows. Finally, we take

[formula]

which depends only on n,Ω,s,M and χ. With such choice of C5, the conditions ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim1C5]) and ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim2C5]) hold, and thus estimate ([\ref=eq:Lambdasmallaim]) is satisfied.

Next we consider the second case ([\ref=eq:Lambdanotsmall]). By ([\ref=eq:keyestimatewithT]) with T  =  ak2, we get that

[formula]

Hence it remains to show that

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

Since

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq:Lambdanotsmall]), we have ([\ref=eq:Lambdanotsmallaim]) if we take C6 large enough so that

[formula]

The proof is completed.
