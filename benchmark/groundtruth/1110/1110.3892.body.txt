Polytropic model fits to the globular cluster NGC 2419 in Modified Newtonian Dynamics

Introduction

The well-known discrepancy between the luminous components of galaxies and their dynamics has been interpreted as evidence that vast quantities of some unknown type of dark (non-luminous) matter surround these celestial structures. Although this dark matter has not yet been directly detected, its existence is consistent with other astrophysical analyses, including the dynamics of galaxy clusters and the formation of large-scale structure [\citep=Springel:2006p3642]. However, a very interesting alternative to this possibility, proposed by [\citet=Milgrom:1983p15031], is that our theory of gravity is incorrect or incomplete. According to this idea, General Relativity (or the Newtonian approximation to that theory) in the low-acceleration regime below a characteristic value a0(  ~  1.2  ×  10- 8  cm  s -  2) under-predicts the actual acceleration.

This Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory has succeeded in passing numerous observational tests over the almost three decades since it was first proposed (for instance, it is able to fit the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies, [\citealt=McGaugh:1998p18778], and tidal dwarf galaxies, [\citealt=Gentile:2007p18789], and can fit gravitational lenses, [\citealt=Shan:2008p18817]). Although there are outstanding problems with the predictions of the MOND theory (the growth of cosmological perturbations, [\citealt=Dodelson:2006p17084], the offset between lensing mass and baryons in the Bullet Cluster, [\citealt=Clowe:2006p15213], Solar System tests, [\citealt=Milgrom:1983p15031] [\citealt=Sereno:2006p15936], dynamical friction in dwarf galaxies, [\citealt=Ciotti:2004p17054] [\citealt=SanchezSalcedo:2006p17060] [\citealt=Nipoti:2008p17050] [\citealt=Angus:2009p17066], and the kinematics and density profile of satellite galaxies, [\citealt=Klypin:2009p17870], to list a few), the more widely-accepted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm has deep-set issues of its own (the missing satellite galaxies, the possible non-existence of dark matter cusps and the high angular momentum of galactic disks, [\citealt=Binney:2004p17034] [\citealt=Primack:2009p17036]). Determining which of the two competing theories of gravity represents reality remains a very important and fundamental task.

Recent improvements in the precision and multiplexing capabilities of spectrographs have led several teams to study large samples of stars in Galactic globular clusters as a means to test MOND on the scale of parsecs up to ~  100  pc [\citep=Scarpa:2003p17001] [\citep=Haghi:2009p16438] [\citep=Jordi:2009p16532] [\citep=Gentile:2010p16618] [\citep=Lane:2010p16975]. In a recent contribution to this effort, our team examined the distant halo globular cluster NGC 2419, re-measuring the surface brightness profile derived from HST/ACS, Subaru/Suprimecam and CFHT/MegaCam images, and obtaining high accuracy radial velocity measurements with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph [\citep=Ibata:2011p18386]. We argued that this globular cluster is by far the best globular cluster target to test MOND with current instrumentation. Most importantly, it lies far enough from the Milky Way so as to relatively isolated, and so suffers little external acceleration. Furthermore, it is massive, so it offers a reasonable number of targets within reach of available high-resolution spectrographs, its velocity dispersion is large enough to be easily measurable, and it is spatially extended, meaning that a substantial fraction of the cluster lies in the low-acceleration regime where MOND differs from Newtonian gravity.

Outside of the very central regions, the cluster is circularly-symmetric in projection, furthermore, the cluster does not show evidence of significant rotation (Paper I). These facts justify using spherical models to fit the system. The analysis presented in Paper I first examined Michie models, which are an extension to King models that allow for anisotropy in the orbits of the constituent stars of a spherical cluster. We found that a Michie model in Newtonian gravity (with a core radius of rc = 11.7  pc, a tidal radius of rt = 331  pc, a central velocity dispersion parameter of σ0 = 6.36  km  s -  1, and an anisotropy radius of ra = 1.5  ×  rc) gives an excellent representation of the data, whereas Michie models in MOND have significantly lower likelihood (the best model being a factor of more than 40000 worse than the best model in Newtonian gravity).

We then expanded our analysis to examine a wider range of models, using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to generate kinematic models consistent with the Jeans equation. The best such model in MOND was again found to be strongly disfavored compared to the best Michie model in Newtonian gravity.

However, these conclusions from Paper I were recently strongly criticized by [\citet=Sanders:2011p18268], on the grounds that other models could reproduce the system well in MOND. The MCMC procedure mentioned above that we implemented in Paper I examined one million different kinematic models. Nevertheless, it is certainly possible that a good model in MOND was missed by the MCMC routine. Indeed, S11 claims to have found a model that provides a counter-example refuting our conclusions, proposing a model in MOND that supposedly fits the available data. Here we will examine the particular polytropic model proposed by S11 and extend the analysis to search for the MOND polytropic model that best fits the data on NCG 2419.

The polytropes

The model proposed by S11 is a polytrope with polytropic index n = 10, central velocity dispersion of c0 = 7.5  km  s -  1, and central density of [formula]. These parameters are related via the polytropic equation:

[formula]

where [formula] is the square of the radial velocity dispersion, and ρ the density. In Paper I, we found that a significant orbital anisotropy was necessary to reproduce the cluster satisfactorily. The model proposed by S11 also included anisotropy, modeled via the Osipkov-Merritt relation [\citep=Osipkov:1979p15077] [\citep=Merritt:1985p15033]

[formula]

where [formula] is the anisotropy parameter. The variable [formula] is of course the square of the tangential (one-dimensional) velocity dispersion. As ra  →    ∞  , the models become isotropic. The value adopted by S11 for the anisotropy radius was ra = 18  pc. Assuming that the cluster is spherical and static, the kinematics and structure must obey the spherical Jeans equation:

[formula]

where r is radial distance, and g is the gravitational acceleration. It is straightforward to integrate this system of equations numerically, using a simple Euler scheme starting from r = 0. This procedure works both for Newtonian dynamics and MOND, though to simulate the latter the acceleration g needs to be altered according to the MOND prescription:

[formula]

where gN is the corresponding Newtonian acceleration that would result from the mass distribution given by ρ(r), while μ is the MOND interpolation function. As S11, we take [formula], with a0 = 10- 8cm  s -  2.

Figure [\ref=fig:S11] shows the surface brightness profile and line of sight velocity dispersion profile resulting from the parameters chosen by S11. The discrepancy with the observations is extremely large. From the 15 points in the surface brightness profile alone we obtain a chi-squared statistic of χ2 = 1123. While the S11 model is thus quantitatively completely excluded, it is very interesting nevertheless to examine whether other parameter values could provide an acceptable fit. To this end we used a general-purpose Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fitting algorithm to search the space of solutions of the polytropic models described above. The input parameters are n, c0, ρ0 and ra, and the code sweeps through the solutions trying to find the most likely model.

The (log) likelihood is calculated in a similar way to Paper I, by adding the logarithm of the likelihood of the models given the surface brightness measurements to the logarithm of the likelihood of the models given the line of sight velocity measurements of individual stars. The surface brightness data are derived from starcounts measured in annuli over the surveyed area. As detailed in Paper I, the HST and Subaru imaging of the cluster has significant gaps, so for any accurate model comparison it is necessary to take into account the missing areas. The window function of the imaging survey was therefore also applied to the models, and the models were integrated over exactly the same annuli as the data.

The surface brightness data, by their very nature, are binned averages. However, the kinematic data have much more discriminating power if they are left unbinned as individual line of sight velocity measurements. The likelihood of the model can then be calculated as the product of the likelihood of each data point (thus for these likelihood calculations we do not use the binned velocity dispersion estimates displayed on the bottom panels of Figures [\ref=fig:S11]-[\ref=fig:Michie], which are shown just to guide the eye). For the dynamical Michie models discussed in Paper I, we integrated the distribution function to derive the line of sight velocity distribution as a function of radius. However, for the polytropic models analyzed here we did not attempt to derive the distribution function, as we judged this an unnecessary complication. The reason for this is that the observed line of sight velocity distribution closely resembles a Gaussian distribution at all radii (see Paper I, Figure 14). We therefore assume that the radial and tangential velocity distributions are Gaussian, and expect this assumption to be a reasonable approximation to reality. Furthermore, it is unlikely that any small deviations from Gaussianity in the true line of sight velocity distributions will have any significant bearing on the results discussed below. It is straightforward then to integrate the polytropic model along the line of sight to obtain the predicted velocity dispersion at the projected radius of each kinematic datum. The full kinematic data set (samples A and B of Paper I) are included in the analysis, since this gives the most favorable case for MOND.

The most likely model found in this manner has c0 = 7.7  km  s -  1, n = 17.3, ra = 11.0  pc and [formula]. By starting the MCMC algorithm from several different initial parameter combinations, we verified that this corresponds to a global likelihood maximum. However, this fit did not take into account whether the resulting best model is physically plausible. We checked that the models obey the Global Density Slope-Anisotropy Inequality [\citep=Ciotti:2010p15374], and checked also for stability by calculating ξhalf, a variant of the Fridman-Polyachenko-Shukhman parameter [\citep=Fridman:1984p17072], defined as twice the ratio of radial to tangential kinetic energy within the half-mass radius (so that ξhalf = 1 for isotropic systems). [\citet=Nipoti:2011p18855] have proposed ξhalf as a stability indicator for spherical stellar systems in MOND, as the maximum value for stability ξhalf,s is only weakly dependent on the density distribution and on the internal acceleration of the system: in particular, for MOND models of NGC 2419 in Paper I we found ξhalf,s  ~  1.4 - 1.5. The best model above has ξhalf = 1.53, slightly beyond the stable region. Implementing a prior that forces ξhalf < 1.5 in the fitting procedure, yields a model with parameters close to the previous best-fit, having c0 = 7.9  km  s -  1, n = 17.6, ra = 11.5  pc and [formula], which has a total mass of [formula]. This best (stable) polytropic model is displayed in Figure [\ref=fig:best]. The residuals with respect to the surface brightness profile are very much smaller than for the S11 model, and a first visual impression is that this is a reasonable model of the cluster. Nevertheless, the likelihood of this fit is a factor of Λ = 1 / 5035 lower than the best Michie model fit in Paper I (and shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Michie]): the surface brightness and kinematic data contribute a factor of 81 and 62 to this likelihood ratio, respectively. In this comparison we have included an 8% component of binaries to the Newtonian model, as fit in Paper I; this has the effect of producing low-level "wings" to the velocity distribution. For the MOND polytropic model, the highest likelihood occurs with 0% binaries.

Both the polytrope and Michie models have the same number of parameters: three structural parameters, plus an anisotropy radius, plus a fitted mass to light ratio and a velocity zero-point. Given that the fits to both models have an identical number of degrees of freedom, the quantity - 2 ln Λ will be asymptotically distributed as χ2(1) [\citep=James:2006p18770]. This allows us to exclude the best MOND polytrope at the 99.996% confidence level.

While we judge the likelihood approach above to provide the strongest and most reliable method for model comparison, some readers may prefer the traditional frequentist χ2 hypothesis test. In the present context, the χ2 method has the disadvantage that it requires the kinematic data to be grouped into radial bins to derive the velocity dispersion. Since the individual velocity measurements come from different radial positions and have different uncertainties, much information is lost in calculating the sub-sample moments. Furthermore, the (weighted) velocity dispersion estimates listed in Paper I have strongly asymmetric non-Gaussian uncertainties. The following χ2 values are therefore presented with these caveats. For the best MOND polytrope, we calculate from the 15 surface brightness data points χ2SB = 22.55, whereas the best Newtonian Michie model has χ2SB = 13.75. From the 6 velocity dispersion measurements (shown in the bottom panels of Figures [\ref=fig:S11]-[\ref=fig:Michie]), we find for the MOND polytrope χ2kin = 7.88, and for the Newtonian Michie model χ2kin = 6.76. There are a total of 21 data points. The number of degrees of freedom for both models is 15. The probability of an experiment with 15 degrees of freedom yielding χ2 = 30.43 (the value for the MOND polytrope fit) or greater by chance is 1%. Hence the χ2 test (which for the reasons stated above is a weak statistical test for our kinematic data) allows us to reject the best polytropic model in MOND at the 99% confidence level. In contrast, a value of χ2 = 20.51 (the case for the best Newtonian Michie model) occurs by chance with 15% probability, which is perfectly acceptable. Inspection of Figure [\ref=fig:best]a shows that the last point in the surface brightness profile contributes significantly to the model discrepancy. Although there is no reason to doubt the validity of this datum, if we ignore it, the MOND polytropic model can still be rejected with 97% confidence.

We note finally that it would have been possible to perform all the analysis described above by first de-projecting the surface brightness distribution to estimate the three-dimensional density ρ(r), as was suggested to us by the anonymous referee; the model comparison would then have rested purely on the kinematic measurements. However, the significant uncertainties in the surface brightness profile at large radius mean that there is no single unequivocal solution to ρ(r), and any uncertainty estimates of this function would involve problems of correlated noise. Hence our choice to project the models into the space of observables should be viewed as a statistically simpler option.

Conclusions

In the analysis presented above we have derived the highest likelihood polytropic model of NGC 2419, fitting to the observed kinematics and structure of this globular cluster assuming MOND and allowing also for the possibility of anisotropy in the stellar orbits. The model is compared to a previously-fitted model in Newtonian gravity. NGC 2419 is probably the best target for this analysis, since its extreme Galactocentric distance (87.5  kpc, [\citealt=DiCriscienzo:2011p15907]) means that it is relatively unaffected by the external field due to the Milky Way (as confirmed by the N-body experiments presented in Paper I), while its large mass and luminosity allow us to resolve the radial velocity dispersion profile with a useful sample of stars. However, we have found that this best-fit polytropic model in MOND is a factor of ~  5000 less likely than the best Michie model fit in Newtonian gravity, and can be rejected with high confidence.

S11 suggests that a MOND model deviating slightly from the polytropic relation might improve the fit. However, we would like to point out that in MOND as in Newtonian gravity, given the density profile of a spherical model, its velocity dispersion profile is fully determined by the anisotropy profile (in other words two different distribution functions generating the same density profile give different velocity dispersion profiles only if the corresponding anisotropy profiles are different). Thus given an observed surface brightness profile, for a choice of M  /  L and β(r), there is only one possible velocity dispersion profile for each theory of gravity. In this sense, the experiment undertaken in Paper I, where we searched through a vast number of possible stable anisotropies at different M  /  L, is the definitive test to evaluate the relative likelihood of models. The fact that the polytropic models in MOND fare badly in comparison to the Newtonian Michie model was anticipated by that experiment. Furthermore, it must be noted that the best MOND model found with the MCMC analysis in Paper I, which was shown to perform poorly with respect to the best Newtonian Michie model (being less likely by a factor of ~   350), turns out to be more likely than the S11 model (by a factor of ~  10238), but also than the best MOND polytrope studied here (by a factor of ~  14). It follows that Sanders' (2011) suggestion to use MOND polytropes, though interesting, did not lead to finding MOND models of NGC 2419 better than those already considered in Paper I. These results reinforce the conclusions presented in Paper I: unless NGC 2419 is significantly non-spherical (for which there is no evidence from the projected measures we have access to), or has a radially-dependent mass to light ratio (which [\citealt=Dalessandro:2008p15030] argue against, based on the distribution of Blue Straggler Stars), or is out of equilibrium, it provides a very strong challenge to MOND theory.

The alternative to this deduction, suggested by S11, is that it is unwise to rely on formal statistical tests given that our data and physical analysis may be "plagued by systematic effects". While we have made the upmost effort to try to understand and take into account the noise properties of the instruments employed in this study (see Paper I), it is of course conceivable that random and systematic uncertainties bias our results. However, no such problems have yet been brought to light, and in the absence of such evidence (which we are aware is not evidence of absence!), we are unwilling to give up the objective tool that is statistical inference.
