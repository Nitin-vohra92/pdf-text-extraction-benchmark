Vacuum Misalignment in High Energy Collisions

Zheng Huang Theoretical Physics Group Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory University of California Berkeley, California 94720

Recently it has been speculated that disoriented chiral condensates may be observed in very high energy hadronic collisions where the temperatures are high and the energy density can be up to several   /  3 [\cite=anselm] [\cite=taylor]. It has been proposed to study this phenomenon at the Tevatron and at the SSC and the proposal has been approved for installation at the Tevatron. The experiment results are expected at the end of 1993. It is further argued that a disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) may be a possible explanation of the Centauro cosmic ray experiments [\cite=centauro], where a large fluctuation in the neutral pion distribution has been observed. In this paper, we study some theoretical aspects of this scenario, in particular, the role of intrinsic symmetry breaking (ISB). When the vacuum is misaligned with the preferential orientation determined by the ISB, the excited mesons are not stable and may have a negative ()2. We further point out a possibility of observing unsuppressed CP violation in the DCC phase.

In high energy collisions, the collision debris form a high temperature (T) and high density environment. These debris are highly relativistic and will expand outward at the speed of light, leaving behind a cool interior where the temperature suddenly drops from T to 0. If initially T > Tc (Tc is the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition), the vacuum orientation in the interior may, in general, be different from that in the exterior, since the interior is separated from the exterior by a hot shell of debris. The misaligned vacuum regions would relax to the true ground state (the state of the empty exterior) by coherent pion emissions. If a coherent configuration of pions are radiated along some particular direction in the isospin vector space, the probability of finding a fixed ratio (r) of neutral pions to charged pions is given by the probability of finding an arbitrary isovector whose angle with π0-direction is β (cos 2β = r)

[formula]

This probability distribution is very different from an ordinary Gaussian distribution where one expects it to be sharply peaked about 1 / 3.

There are many theoretical uncertainties in this picture, among which are the role of the intrinsic symmetry breaking, that is, the quark current masses, and the size of the correlated regions. In the linear σ-model,

[formula]

where φ is a four component vector [formula] in O(4) or equivalently [formula], there is an explicit symmetry breaking term cσ. Even at high temperature, cσ term cannot be dropped since the temperature dependence of c is weak. The least free energy configuration at T is not (0,0) but (〈σ〉,0). As a result, there is a pre-existent preferential direction when the chiral phase transition occurs. In principle, all possible oriented configurations from the ensemble must be a prior weighted by their corresponding free energies at temperature T. However, when T  ≥  Tc, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) is very small ([formula]) compared to T, the vacuum configurations with different orientations at the critical temperature do not have enough free energy to "relax" to the preferential direction if the system is out of equilibrium and the temperature drops fast enough. Practically, these field configurations [formula] will have approximately equal probability, evolving toward the subcritical region in the manner of a quench.

The crucial question in this picture is the typical size of the correlated region. If the dynamical evolution of the system is a process of cooling through equilibrium, one expects that domains in the interior will have different vacuum orientations, which individually evolve according to dynamics. Even if the misalignment does occur independently in small regions, their effects, however, are modest and the large fluctuations in the pion distribution will be washed out by averaging the orientations. However, as pointed out by Rajagopal and Wilczek (RW) [\cite=rw], the situation can be qualitatively different if the cooling process is very rapid and the system is out of equilibrium. An analog is quenching magnet by cooling a piece of hot iron. Typically what happens is the mismatch of the configurations and their evolution. After a quench, the high temperature configuration does not have time to "react" to the sudden change of the environment; instead, it will satisfy a zero temperature equation of motion. For example, the VEV's of φ would stay what it was at high temperature for a while, that is, |〈φ〉|  ~  0. But because the temperature is zero after the quench, the Goldstone boson ()2 becomes negative

[formula]

and the long wavelength modes will grow with time and the short wavelength will be suppressed. As a result, there will be a large size of the correlated region in which the vacuum orientation may be unique, and the pion emission from this region will be quite structural. This picture is also supported by some recent studies on this issue in lower dimensions and a four-fermion interaction model [\cite=kogan].

The appearance of negative ()2 modes due to the hesitation of the VEV's of φ when the temperature suddenly changes offers a serious theoretical challenge in the studies of the critical phenomena. Whether such a mechanism is also to provide enough energy density for the pion emission is however unclear. When |〈φ〉| stays around zero, even though the long range correlation may occur, the energy density of such a structure is small since it is proportional to |〈φ〉|. It is not clear that there will be enough pion radiations to be observed before |〈φ〉| oscillates to its zero temperature value. When |〈φ〉| gets close to the zero temperature VEV's, this mechanism cease to work and the correlated region would shrink into small pieces.

However, we argue that another mechanism may be in effect to hold the correlated region together even longer, and in the mean time to provide a large energy density. That is, when |〈φ〉| gets to its final value, the vacuum is still misaligned with the intrinsic symmetry breaking (ISB) since it takes longer for the vacuum orientation to relax due to the small free energy difference; and the Goldstone bosons are not stable: their ()2 can be negative if the misalignment is big enough. The picture based on this mechanism is in essence closer to Ref. [\cite=anselm] where the amplitude of classical pion fields is equal to the zero temperature VEV of φ. A theoretical idealization can be made by considering a zero temperature lagrangian while the vacuum orientation is however pre-determined at high temperature (not by the ISB). The treatment is opposite to what we do in the perturbation theory with degeneracy or in the vacuum alignment procedure [\cite=dashen]. We have a symmetric potential V0 and a symmetry breaking V1. In the perturbation theory, one has to first compute the vacuum orientation according to V1 and expand V1 in that basis. In our consideration, however, the vacuum orientation is set before the quench, and can in general mismatch with V1. For example, one may specify the VEV

[formula]

where [formula] is a unit vector in isospin space. The energy density of the vacuum is determined by the perturbation V1 in the lowest order

[formula]

Since [formula], the vacuum is misaligned. Note that Eθ is larger than E0 in the exterior and the difference is ΔEθ = Eθ - E0  =   - m2πF2π(1 -  cos θ) (and is different from that in [\cite=taylor]). The quasi-Goldstone modes excited from this θ-vacuum are not generally stable. To see this, we shift the fields as

[formula]

and the would-be Goldstone bosons have a ()2

[formula]

([\ref=c]) can also be calculated by [formula] [\cite=dashen]. When [formula], one has negative ()2 modes. These modes are not stable and long wavelength fluctuations will grow so that the interior with a vacuum orientation θ in the interval [formula] may be a correlated region and the pion production will be very structural. The energy density Eθ in this region is positive, which offers a good probability to observe coherent pion emissions.

It is potentially important to ask what happens to the U(1)A phase in the disoriented chiral condensate since the vacua may also differ in their U(1)A orientations. This query immediately runs into the question of the role of the axial anomaly in QCD. The reason why we have an approximate SU(2)-degeneracy of the vacua is that the ISB is small compared to ΛQCD. However, the U(1)A symmetry is badly broken by the chiral anomaly or the instanton effects at zero temperature. Nevertheless, at high temperature, the symmetry breaking caused by the anomaly is much softer than the ISB (the quark mass term). Because of the color screening effect, a typical instanton amplitude is generally suppressed at a high T [\cite=gross], e.g.,

[formula]

which provides a suppressing factor of 10- 7 for a typical hadronic energy scale if T = 2ΛQCD. Therefore, if the chiral anomaly is indeed mediated by the instanton effects, one has an additional approximate vacuum degeneracy in the U(1)A directions at high enough temperatures which may be attainable in high energy collisions. As a result, we have another freedom to choose the vacuum orientation (the freedom is again slightly violated by the mass term) if the instanton effects is effectively turned off at a high T. In terms of the quark language, the quark condensate may be tilted into one of the U(1)A directions

[formula]

There are two points to be clarified. First, if the cooling is in equilibrium, when the temperature drops from high T to Tc, the U(1)A-degeneracy is completely lifted since the instanton effects become substantial at Tc (one may avoid this by arguing that instanton interactions only become strong at an even lower temperature). Thus an out-of-equilibrium condition is as necessary as in the case of the SU(2) disorientation. Indeed, if there is a quench, the VEV's will stay around zero for some time as suggested by Rajagopal and Wilczek (RW) [\cite=rw], a disoriented U(1)A phase is possible. Second, a negative ()2 for the U(1)A particle (the η particle if we restrict ourselves to the two-flavor case) may not arise from the RW mechanism in the intermediate stages as it is the case for pions. This is because η is not a would-be Goldstone boson, its ()2 is given

[formula]

When T suddenly drops to zero, K(0) is large and may yield a positive m2η if K(0) > μ2(0). Although it is not very clear whether one needs a large size of the correlated region in order to have the CP-violating effects to be discussed below, it is still possible to have a negative η ()2 from the other mechanism which we have pointed out earlier.

What might be the effects associated with the U(1)A phase disorientation in high energy collisions? There will be an anomalous probability distribution of η and pion productions if the interior is also correlated in the U(1)A phase through the vacuum misalignment mechanism. It would be very hard to measure such an effect since the η has a large mass. However, there may be another possibility, that is, the CP violation in a disoriented U(1)A phase. The basic idea is following. Normally, if CP is conserved in QCD, the chiral condensate in ([\ref=d]) must be real because of the vacuum alignment. If, under some extreme condition, the vacuum condensate is misaligned with the ISB and the chiral anomaly, it is on longer possible to define definite CP transformation properties (parities) of η and pions that are consistent in both the vacuum and the lagrangian. In general, these mesons whose parities would be negative are mixtures of CP-even and -odd states. As a result of the mixing, an initially CP-odd state can decay to a CP-even state (e.g. η  →  2π) and CP symmetry is violated. This is what may happen in a rapid cooling process. At a high T the vacua are almost degenerate in their U(1)A phases, any φ-direction is equivalent to any other directions because K(T)  ~  0. There is no CP violation even if φ  ≠  0,π. Following a quench, the instanton interactions are suddenly turned on and K(0)  ≠  0, the misaligned configurations (φ  ≠  0,π) are not stable and can only relax to φ = 0 through CP violating processes, for example, η  →  2π decays. Luckily, we may be able to observe these events in high energy collisions even though QCD is a CP conserving theory under a normal condition.

The theoretical description of the picture can be idealized by considering an extended linear σ-model where φ representing LqR has eight degrees of freedom if only two flavors are relevant

[formula]

The potential for meson fields at zero temperature reads

[formula]

where V0 is invariant under U(2)L  ×  U(2)R

[formula]

the ISB mass term

[formula]

and the instanton-induced U(1)A-breaking term [\cite=huang]

[formula]

We consider a CP conserving theory by neglecting possible strong CP phases in Vm and VK. In this extended model, the disorientation in isospin space is described by the non-zero VEV's of [formula] fields (rather than [formula]). We will concentrate on the disorientation of the U(1)A phase. The VEV of φ as a relic of high temperature history is assumed

[formula]

The dynamics of the excited fields from this vacuum is obtained by shifting the fields (to get rid of tadpole terms) φ  →  eiφ(Fπ  +  φ). The vacuum energy density is calculated in the lowest order

[formula]

which is minimized at φ = 0. Thus a disoriented vacuum has a higher energy density. The η ()2 reads from the shifted potential or simply from [formula]

[formula]

Clearly η acquires an additional mass from VK. Like 2π in ([\ref=c]), 2η can be negative. The formation of a large size of φ-oriented region is also possible. The energy density Eφ is associated with the disorientation of the U(1)A phase; it can be released by CP violating processes. The CP violation occurs because it is not possible to define CP transformation property of φ; in particular, σ ([formula]) will mix with η ([formula]) in the presence of VK via an interaction

[formula]

Such a mixing is genuine only if the U(1)A-breaking term VK is present. Equivalently, one can diagonalize ([\ref=x]) by redefining the physical states, and CP violating vertices can be read off from the potential. For example, the amplitude of η  →  2π decays reads (K = m2η - m2π)

[formula]

and the decay rate is estimated

[formula]

This is expected because if the ππ channels are allowed, they become the most dominant decay modes. It is very important to note that unlike a normal η particle whose decay rate is about a kilovolt, the η in the DCC can decay very fast (~   several fm's) so that it could be in a full contact with the condensate before it decays and we may be able to observe such decay modes.

There are some theoretical and experimental uncertainties in this picture. Do we need a large size of U(1)A-phase correlated region to observe η  →  2π decays? We suspect so because otherwise we would average the amplitude quantum mechanically

[formula]

In this case, the negativity of 2η is very crucial to implement the idea. But it is not clear that ([\ref=f]) is really legitimate if different domains in the interior are independent in the U(1)A directions. Another question is how many η's can be produced in an event. Following [\cite=taylor], the total energy in the interior (mod E0) is

[formula]

where R  ~  3. Thus there may be as many as 10 η-mesons.

In summary, we have studied some theoretical aspects in an interesting proposal to observe the disoriented chiral condensate in high energy collisions. In particular, we have suggested an additional mechanism to have a negative ()2 for the mesons responsible for the formation of a large size of the correlated region. A possibility to observe unsuppressed strong CP violation such as η  →  2π decays is pointed out. This study may shed some light on the issues of chiral anomaly, instanton effects including the color screening mechanism and CP violation in strong interactions.
