1. Introduction

It is usually thought that present experimental data indicate that baryon number (B), electron number (Le), muon number (Lμ), and tau number (Lτ) should be taken as conserved quantum numbers, at least to a very good approximation. Actually, if we assume the conservation of B, Le, and Lμ, then there is no need for Lτ. For example, the fact that in neutrino interactions on nuclei, τ leptons are not produced is explained by the conservation of Le and Lμ. Analogously, the fact that τ does not decay into an antiproton + mesons requires only the conservation of B.

The reason that Lτ appears to be conserved is that given the standard SU(2) ×   U(1) electroweak gauge model with its minimal particle content, the conservation of B, Le, Lμ, and Lτ is automatic. An excursion beyond the standard model is necessary to see how Lτ may be different from Le and Lμ.

2. Supersymmetric Standard Model

Consider for example any supersymmetric extension of the standard model. In a notation where only left chiral superfields are counted, the quarks and leptons transform under SU(3) ×   SU(2) ×   U(1) as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

The Higgs superfields are

[formula]

The allowed terms in the superpotential are then

and

Whereas the first four terms conserve B, Le, Lμ, and Lτ, the above four do not and they are usually just ignored. What this amounts to is the imposition of B, Le, Lμ, and Lτ as conserved quantum numbers.

Instead of forbidding all possible combinations of the last four terms, it is just as natural to forbid some of them, resulting in the conservation of one or two lepton numbers. It has been shown[\cite=1] that there are 5 ×   3 ways of doing this, as given below.

Here the lepton-number assignments (Le,Lμ) are displayed for models 1 and 2, and L for models 3-5. For each model, there are of course three possible variations resulting from the permutations of e,μ, and τ.

3. Zero Lepton Number for τ

If τ is to have zero lepton number, then Model 1 is the prototype.[\cite=2] The superpotential is given by

[formula]

where the coupling matrix hi has been chosen to be diagonal. It reduces to the conventional supersymmetric model in the limit fe, ~ fμ, ~ fij, and μ' go to zero. The neutralino mass matrix spanning the gauginos (- iλγ, - iλz), the higgsinos (ψ01,  ~  ψ02), and ν3 is then

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], and M1,2 are allowed gauge-invariant mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauginos. As a result, the physical ντ is mostly ν3, but there is a small admixture of the other states so that it acquires a small see-saw Majorana mass

[formula]

For μ  ~  1 TeV, tan β  ~  10,  ~  μ'  ~  10 MeV, an interesting value of 5 eV is obtained for mντ.

In the conventional supersymmetric model without the μ' term, the smallest eigenvalue of the 4 ×   4 neutralino mass matrix is that of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and since R parity, defined to be ( - 1)2j + 3B + L, is conserved in that case, the LSP is absolutely stable. This has very important implications for the experimental search for supersymmetry because the LSP would be a weakly interacting particle which leaves the detector unobserved except that it carries away momentum and energy. Here, it is clear that ντ is the LSP, so that any of the other neutralinos such as the photino γ̃ (i.e. - iλγ) would decay through a scalar electron for example into e+e-ντ and might not remain stable within the detector in a typical high-energy physics experiment. 4. Phenomenological Constraints and Implications

The existence of the L3Qidcj term is a source of tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents. The most stringent constraints come from the neutral kaons. The magnitude of the KL  -  KS mass difference implies

[formula]

and the KL  →  μ+μ- rate implies

[formula]

The possible deviation from zero of the Michel parameter η in μ  →  eν decay implies

[formula]

The parameters ρ and δ remain at 0.75 as in the standard model.

Since the nonconservation of Lτ is only achieved here with the intervention of supersymmetry, possible tests of this model will likely involve the direct production of supersymmetric particles. The best case is [\cite=2]

which involves (for the τ+τ+ mode) the subprocesses u  →  ũLd̃*R through gluino exchange and their subsequent decay into dτ+ and ūτ+ respectively. The analogous reaction for an electron-proton collider is

which proceeds via the production of ẽRd̃R and their subsequent decay into νeτ- and uτ- respectively. 5. Conclusion

If supersymmetry exists, the issue of lepton number conservation will have to be reexamined experimentally. The conventional wisdom that L is conserved additively (or multiplicatively if neutrinos have Majorana masses) may not be correct. An interesting possibility would be that τ is actually a nonleptonic superparticle and
