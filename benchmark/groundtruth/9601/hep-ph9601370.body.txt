The common believe that Quantumchromodynamics (QCD) is the right theory of strong interactions, stems from a good agreement of theoretical predictions with the experimental data in deep inelastic scattering experiments [\cite=yn83]. The theoretical approach is thereby based upon perturbation theory, which is the appropriate technique since the effective expansion parameter, i.e. the running coupling constant, is small at high momentum transfer. At medium energies, the non-trivial ground state properties of the QCD vacuum induce corrections to the perturbative result. These corrections can be systematically included within an operator-product-expansion (OPE) [\cite=shi79] [\cite=tar84], where non-perturbative vacuum properties are parameterized in terms of condensates. The powerful technique of QCD sum rules [\cite=nar89] [\cite=rei85] combines the OPE and dispersion relations in order to address hadron properties. The actual values of the condensates are obtained by fitting the masses of mesons and hadrons [\cite=nar89] [\cite=rei85]. Unfortunately, a direct calculation of the condensates and hadron properties from QCD is not feasible at present stage, since a large effective coupling constant at low energies renders the investigations cumbersome.

Exploiting the realization of symmetries in low energy QCD provides further inside into the QCD vacuum structure and results in low energy theorems [\cite=ch84]. In particular, the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetries [\cite=nam61] leads to a good description of the light pseudo-scalar mesons as Goldstone bosons [\cite=appli]. A further consequence of chiral symmetry is the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GMOR) relation, which relates the pion mass mπ and the pion decay constant fπ to the product of current quark mass m and quark condensate 〈q〉. In the SU(2) iso-spin symmetry case, one has

[formula]

This equation is of particular importance, since it provides access to meson observables by simply studying properties of the quark ground state. Recently, the GMOR relation gained further phenomenological importance in estimating the density dependence of the meson observables as requested to describe compact star matter [\cite=newbr].

Despite of the success due to sum rules and symmetry arguments, one must resort to low energy effective models in order to move towards a "microscopic" descriptions of baryons and mesons. The one-gluon-exchange models [\cite=pa77] [\cite=sme91] [\cite=rob94] [\cite=fra96] [\cite=cah92] [\cite=cah95] have proven to be phenomenological very successful. In these models, the quark interaction is described by an effective one-gluon exchange, which match the well known interaction at high energies. The models are (at least one-loop) renormalizable, and confinement of quarks can be described by a quark propagator which finally vanishes due to infra-red singularities [\cite=sme91], or which does not have poles corresponding to asymptotic quark states [\cite=rob94]. Meson phenomenology can be successfully addressed [\cite=fra96] [\cite=cah95] (for a review see [\cite=rob94]), and the description of baryons in terms of the Faddeev equation approach seems feasible [\cite=cah92].

Within the context of the one-gluon-exchange model, Cahill and Gunner recently argued that the GMOR relation ([\ref=eq:1]) is wrong. A new formula which determines the product of pion mass and decay constant in terms of the quark propagator, was proposed [\cite=cah96] [\cite=fra96]. The discrepancy originates from the definition of the quark condensate as the trace of the quark propagator. This definition naturally provides a logarithmic divergent condensate, whereas the GMOR relation seems to require a finite condensate. The arguments involved are not confined to the one-gluon-exchange model implying that the problem at hand exists in the general context of QCD.

In this letter, we reconsider the GMOR relation in the context of the one-gluon-exchange models. We will show that, in the product of current mass and quark condensate, the logarithmic divergence of the condensate is precisely compensated by the vanishing of the bare current mass. The product is finite and coincides with the formula derived by Cahill and Gunner [\cite=cah96] and by Frank and Roberts [\cite=fra96], implying that the GMOR relation ([\ref=eq:1]) also holds in one-gluon-exchange models.

The Euclidean quark condensate is defined by

[formula]

where S(x) is the quark propagator, which in general can be decomposed in momentum space as

[formula]

At large momentum transfer k, the asymptotic behavior of the function Z(k2) and the self-energy Σ(k2) can be obtained in perturbation theory augmented with operator-product corrections. Z(k2) rapidly approaches 1,

[formula]

whereas Σ(k2) behaves like [\cite=pol76] [\cite=mir93],

[formula]

where μ is the renormalization scale, mR the renormalized current quark mass and 〈q〉OPE the quark condensate used as parameter in the OPE. dm is the anomalous mass dimension, which can be calculated in perturbative QCD, i.e.

[formula]

with Nf being the number of quark flavors. Inserting ([\ref=eq:4]) into ([\ref=eq:2]), one finds [\cite=rob94] in the chiral limit [formula] without resorting to a particular model

[formula]

where Nc is the number of colors and the dots indicate finite terms. This implies that the definition ([\ref=eq:2]) in general produces a logarithmic divergent condensate (in the chiral limit.)

The crucial observation is that ([\ref=eq:6]) does not rule out the definition of the quark condensate ([\ref=eq:2]), since the GMOR relation requires the product of current mass and condensate. The generic behavior of the bare current mass is to vanish at large values of the UV-cutoff Λ (see e.g. [\cite=co89]). One finds in QCD [\cite=yn83] [\cite=mir93]

[formula]

This directly leads to a cancelation of the logarithmic divergence in the product of current mass and condensate [\cite=mir93], i.e.

[formula]

This implies that the condensate appearing in the OPE is perfectly compatible with the one entering the GMOR relation.

In the rest of the letter, we will show that the mass formula, derived by Cahill and Gunner [\cite=cah96] and independently by Frank and Roberts [\cite=fra96], coincides with the left hand side of ([\ref=eq:8]). For this purpose, we resort to a particular model, where the self-energy is provided by the Dyson-Schwinger equation

[formula]

where Λ is the UV-regulator, which we will later take to infinity. The kernel D((p - k)2) can be interpreted as Lorentz and color trace of the effective gluon-propagator. It is not necessary to specify D((p - k)2) for our argument here. We only demand that D(k2) matches the large momentum behavior known from perturbative QCD, i.e.

[formula]

and that the function D((p - k)2) peaks at p = k. Here, we do not consider models which request a modification of the UV-renormalization in order to account for infra-red divergences. With the above standard assumptions, one observes that the ansätze ([\ref=eq:4a]) and ([\ref=eq:4]) for the asymptotic behavior of the self-energy and wave function are self-consistent solutions of the DS-equations. In particular, the momentum integration ([\ref=eq:9]) is in fact UV-finite, and the cutoff dependence of the current mass in ([\ref=eq:9]) is precisely that of ([\ref=eq:7]) [\cite=la96].

For later use, we also provide the self-energy Σ0(k2) in the chiral limit, which satisfies

[formula]

For small deviations off the chiral limit (mR  ≪  Σ0(0)), one might neglect the change in the function Z(k2) [\cite=rob94] implying that the same function Z(k2) appears in ([\ref=eq:9]) and ([\ref=eq:10]).

The properties of the light pseudo-scalar mesons in the case of a small explicit breaking of chiral symmetry can be addressed by powerful techniques which step by step exploit the symmetry aspects and which became standard nowadays (for a review see e.g. [\cite=rob94]). Exploiting the chiral symmetry, it is possible to relate the quark self-energy to the Bethe-Salpeter vertex for the pion, i.e.

[formula]

The normalization is obtained by normalizing the charge of the pion with the help of the electro-magnetic form factor to unity. The full electro-magnetic vertex function at small momentum of the incoming photon, which enters the electro-magnetic form factor, and the full axial vector vertex function, needed to bring fπ into the game, are unambiguously known from differential Ward identities. Expanding the pion's Bethe-Salpeter equation to leading order in mR (which is by assumption small to the scale set by Σ0(0)) and m2π with the help of a derivative expansion, we find

[formula]

In this equality, the regulator can be safely removed (Λ  →    ∞  ), since the integrand asymptotically decreases like 1 / k8 (up to logarithmic corrections). Since the deviation of Σ(k2) off its chiral limit value Σ0(k2) is proportional to the mass mR(μ) which is the scale of explicit chiral symmetry breaking, we define

[formula]

The asymptotic behavior of Σ(k2) and Σ0(k2), deduced from ([\ref=eq:4]), implies

[formula]

Inserting ([\ref=eq:13]) into equation ([\ref=eq:12]) yields to leading order in mR

[formula]

This result agrees with the findings of Cahill and Gunner [\cite=cah96] and of Frank and Roberts [\cite=fra96]. The main observation is that even for constant σ(k2) the momentum integration rapidly converges.

In order to relate the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:14]) to equation ([\ref=eq:8]), we first expand the Dyson-Schwinger equation ([\ref=eq:9]) to leading order in mR(μ), i.e.

[formula]

Note that the series ([\ref=eq:15]) with respect to powers of mR is well defined, since it can be verified that all appearing integrals are UV-finite.

In order to relate the formula of Cahill and Gunner ([\ref=eq:14]) to the standard GMOR relation, we multiply both sides of ([\ref=eq:15]) by

[formula]

and integrate over the momentum p, i.e.

[formula]

[formula]

In the last line of ([\ref=eq:16]), we have used the Dyson-Schwinger equation ([\ref=eq:10]) for the self-energy Σ0(k2) in the chiral limit. The first and the last term of ([\ref=eq:16]) cancel to yield

[formula]

The divergence of the integral at the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:17a]) in the limit Λ  →    ∞   is precisely compensated by the vanishing bare current mass m(Λ) to yield the finite result at the left hand side of ([\ref=eq:17a]). We therefore obtain our main result

[formula]

This result was numerically tested by Cahill [\cite=cah96p] using the model from [\cite=cah95] and by ourselves within the particular model [\cite=la96].

In conclusions, the cutoff-dependence of the bare current mass m(Λ) precisely cancels the logarithmic divergence of the quark condensate which is defined via the trace of the quark propagator. The finite value of the product of current mass and quark condensate precisely yields the formula recently derived by Cahill and Gunner [\cite=cah96] and independently by Frank and Roberts [\cite=fra96]. We have therefore shown that there is no reason to conclude that the GMOR relation is wrong in the context of the one-gluon-exchange models. The above definition of the quark condensate is also compatible with its OPE definition via the asymptotic behavior of the self-energy. The GMOR relation is still satisfied.
