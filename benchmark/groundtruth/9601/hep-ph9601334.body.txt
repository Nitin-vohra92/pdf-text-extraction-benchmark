DETERMINATION OF LEADING TWIST NON-SINGLET OPERATOR MATRIX ELEMENTS BY QCD SUM RULES

Introduction

QCD sum rules provide one of the few ways we have quantitatively to determine strong interaction effects and are applied widely when extracting information from data. For example QCD sum rule estimates for higher twist matrix elements have been used when testing the Bjorken and Ellis Jaffe sum rules [\cite=kogan1] [\cite=bbk] [\cite=ross] [\cite=stein]. However to our knowledge there has not been a systematic study of the validity and accuracy of these techniques when applied to structure functions. Given the importance of the subject we consider this to be a serious omission and the object of this paper is to provide just such a study. In particular we will use QCD sum rules to determine the leading twist-two non-singlet operator matrix elements (OMEs) contributing to deep inelastic scattering from nucleon targets. In addition the errors to be expected from the analysis are carefully analysed. The results will then be compared with the precise measurements of the leading twist matrix elements that are now available. This will allow us not only to compare the QCD prediction with experiment but also to test our error estimates.

The determination of nucleon structure functions via QCD sum rules has been pioneered by Belyaev and Ioffe [\cite=ioffe-dis] [\cite=ioffe-dis2]and subsequently developed further by Balitsky et al [\cite=bbk]. Indeed Belyaev and Ioffe have presented the predictions for the non-singlet structure functions themselves. To date we know of no analysis of the leading twist OMEs themselves and, given the current interest in determining specific OMEs in various processes [\cite=ross] [\cite=stein] [\cite=braun2], we consider it important so to do. As we shall see there are significant differences to be expected in the accuracy of determination of the matrix elements compared to the determination of the structure functions at fixed x. We will also estimate the errors that arise from a variety of sources. The first is the inherent error following from the uncertainty of parameters such as the quark and gluon condensates. The second is the error that arises from neglect of higher order terms in the expansion in powers of 1 / p2 where p is the momentum flowing through the nucleon source ("higher-dimension" terms). The third is the error introduced when estimating the left-hand-side of the sum rule by the resonance contribution. Finally we consider the error following from the perturbative expansion in powers of the QCD coupling. Of these it is the second and forth terms that we find give the dominant source of error in the determination of the OMEs and they are irreducible in the sense that there appears to be no choice for the Borel transform scale M that is consistent with the resonant saturation requirement while leading to a convergent perturbative expansion and a well behaved ([formula]) expansion. We discuss the origin of this problem and find it largely comes from the behaviour of the structure functions near x = 1. For this reason the situation is better for the determination of the structure functions at fixed x as originally suggested by Belyaev and Ioffe [\cite=ioffe-dis] [\cite=ioffe-dis2]. We reanalyse the fixed-x predictions, again making careful error estimates. We find that even for the intermediate values of x which have some convergence in the perturbative expansion the errors are large. Moreover there is still a question concerning the large corrections near x = 1 for these are related to the quark not hadron kinematics. As reliable predictions require some smearing of the predictions before comparison with experiment is justified, we expect some re-introduction of the sensitivity to the large perturbative corrections at large x. Finally we comment on the origin of the large corrections and argue that they are likely to be present in the determination of other interesting quantities including the determination of higher twist OMEs.

Analysis

To illustrate the difference between the calculation of the OMEs and the quark distribution, let us start with the QCD sum rules for the quark distributions obtained in ref. [\cite=ioffe-dis] :

[formula]

[formula]

where m is the nucleon mass, C is the Euler constant,

[formula]

[formula]

E0(z)  =  1 - e- z, [formula], W is the continuum threshold while L =  ln (M / Λ) /  ln (μ  /  Λ) takes account of the anomalous dimension of the currents. We express the M2 dependence of λ̄2N(M2) using the mass sum rule [\cite=mass]

[formula]

In equations ([\ref=start1]) and ([\ref=start2]), the first term on the LHS comes from the resonant saturation with a nucleon pole and the second parametrises some of the effects of the non-resonant background corresponding to the interference of the pole term with a continuum contribution. The RHS comes from an evaluation of the deep-inelastic scattering process in perturbative QCD. Note that the calculation keeps only leading powers in an expansion in ([formula]) and hence projects onto the leading twist contribution. For this reason, when comparing with experiment, the comparison in [\cite=ioffe-dis] was made at high Q2. However, this introduces an error due to the neglect of the anomalous dimension terms generating scaling "violations". As we presently discuss, these are most easily included when calculating the OMEs.

The predictions for the structure functions following from ([\ref=start1]) and ([\ref=start2]) are obtained in the usual way by matching the LHS and RHS at fixed x and Q2. We shall return to these shortly. First, however, let us consider the predictions for the twist-2 OMEs. They follow immediately from the equations ([\ref=start1]) and ([\ref=start2]) simply by taking moments:

[formula]

[formula]

Integrating the structure functions to obtain the moments as above is equivalent to evaluating the OMEs directly by the standard QCD sum rules method, inserting operators between nucleon currents. The only subtlety is that the [formula] term in eq. ([\ref=start2]) is replaced by [formula] where μ20 is the scale at which the operator is renormalised. This should be chosen in a manner that avoids higher order corrections, we take (μ20≃1GeV2) since the OMEs are taken between nucleon states.

The twist-2 OMEs are now determined:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and Γ(a) is the Gamma function. Since we are using dimensional regularisation, the singularities at x = 1 in eqs. ([\ref=start1]) and ([\ref=start2]) are not present, [formula] being replaced by the "+ prescription" [formula]. The term proportional to a2 in equation ([\ref=dmoment]) corresponds to the δ(1 - x) piece which was omitted in the structure function expression in eq. ([\ref=start2]) applicable at intermediate values of x.

In the following analysis we are particularly concerned with the errors involved in the sum rules determination. We shall use the following parameter values together with the quoted error estimates:

a  =  0.55  ±  0.20GeV3 [\cite=ioffe-dis] [\cite=gasser],

b  =  0.45  ±  0.10GeV4 [\cite=ioffe-dis] [\cite=voloshin] [\cite=narison],

μ = 0.5GeV which implies αsa2 = 0.13GeV6 for three flavour theory as in [\cite=ioffe-dis],

μ20 = 1GeV2,

Λ  =  125  ±  25MeV consistent with the range of values used in QCD sum rules; in ref. [\cite=ioffe-dis] it was taken to be 100MeV and in ref. [\cite=mass] it was taken as 150MeV,

m = 1.00  ±  0.15GeV [\cite=mass],

W2 = 2.3GeV2.

The uncertainty in the continuum threshold W2 is taken to be of order 10% consistent with [\cite=ioffe-dis] where the analysis was done for two choices of W2: 2.3 and 2.5 GeV2. However, as we shall see, increasing the uncertainty to 100% will not affect our phenomenological discussion (c.f. [\cite=ross] where varying W2 between 0.8 and 5 hardly affected the results).

Let us first consider the QCD sum rules for the OMEs. Figure  [\ref=fittingmoment] plots the RHS of the equations ([\ref=umoment]) and ([\ref=dmoment]) in the range [formula] for the moments 3 and 6.

According to the equations ([\ref=umoment]) and ([\ref=dmoment]), the RHS should be linear in ([formula]), and this may be seen to be approximately true. To quantify this, we consider the differences between a linear and a quadratic fit to the RHS. In the case of u-quark (d-quark) a quadratic fit changes the constant term by 46%, 23% (28%, 24%) for n = 6, 3 respectively. This gives a measure of the accuracy of the approximation of ignoring such terms in the LHS of the QCD sum rules. In order to reduce this uncertainty, one must show that the form of the continuum contributions are constrained to prohibit quadratic terms of this magnitude. For clarity of presentation, we shall not add this error to the errors found from the uncertainties in determining the parameters used, but it should be remembered that it must be included in the final error estimates.

The second source of errors comes from the uncertainties in parameters. By varying them over their allowed range and performing a linear fit, we are able to determine the range of intercepts (the OMEs) consistent within errors with the QCD sum rules. In Figs.  [\ref=figmoments].a and  [\ref=figmoments].b, we display the final results for the OMEs together with their errors following from these uncertainties. As discussed above, these are the twist-2 OMEs with normalisation scale of order 1GeV2. In order to compare with experiment, the moments of the measured structure functions at high Q2 are taken and fitted to the contribution of all (leading and non-leading twist) operators. At very high Q2, the leading twist operators dominate and so, using perturbative QCD to calculate the coefficient functions, the leading-twist OMEs normalised at a scale of order 1GeV2 are readily obtained [\cite=dick].

The results obtained in Figs.  [\ref=figmoments].a and  [\ref=figmoments].b are disappointing for the QCD sum rules method. The errors are very large, yet the discrepancy with experiment is even greater. To explore the origin of this discrepancy we consider the effect of the higher dimension terms and the higher order perturbative expansion, by looking at the effect of adding successive terms to the expansion, and comparing the result at each step.

The results are shown in Figs.  [\ref=succmoment].a and  [\ref=succmoment].b. From them we see that there is reasonable agreement with experiment for the u-quark in the absence of the O(αsa2) corrections. The latter contribution is peaked at x≃1 and affects all moments. For the d-quark, the agreement with experiment is spoilt both by the O(αsa2) terms and by the quark condensate which contributes a term [formula]. Again these terms contribute to all moments. The appearance of such large perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the free quark model result signals a breakdown of the expansion assumed in deriving the sum rules. For this reason, the error analysis presented is inadequate, and one may understand why there is overall disagreement between theory and experiment. It would be very interesting to determine whether the alternate interpolating nucleon current used in [\cite=stein] improves the situation.

As the large corrections just discussed appear for large x, there is a possibility that the predictions for structure functions are better behaved and so we turn to a consideration of these effects here. Figure  [\ref=fittingstrfun] shows the RHS of the equations  [\ref=start1] and  [\ref=start2] in the range [formula] for the values 0.3, 0.6 of x. From the RHS we may immediately determine the quark distribution at each value of x. Again using a linear and a quadratic fit, we may estimate the contribution to the errors from the deviation from a straightline. In the case of u-quark (d-quark) a quadratic fit changes the constant term by 146%, 48% (34%, 20%) for the values x = 0.6,0.3 respectively. This gives uncertainties which again should be added to the final errors.

Turning to the errors related to the uncertainties in the parameters, we show in Figures  [\ref=strfun].a and  [\ref=strfun].b the results for the up and down valence quarks. For comparison, the observed twist-2 contribution to the structure functions is shown-obtained by analysis of the large Q2 data and continued using QCD corrections to Q2 = 1GeV2[\cite=dick].

As before, we explore the effects of the higher dimension and higher order terms. This is presented in Figures  [\ref=succstrfun].a and  [\ref=succstrfun].b. The region where the effect of adding the gluon condensate followed by the αsa2 perturbative term does not exceed 30% corresponds to 0.4  ≤  x  ≤  0.64 for the u-quark and 0.15  ≤  x  ≤  0.25 for the d-quark. For the u-quark in the appropriate region, the predictions are consistent with measurements within the errors. However, as one may see, the theoretical errors are rather large.

Summary and Conclusion

The analysis shows that for the moments, in contrast to the structure functions, there is no region of convergence for the OPE series. The reason is that the behaviour at x = 1 causes the power and/  or perturbative expansion to break down. For the u-quark, this was caused by the presence of the perturbative term with component proportional to [formula] regularized by the "+   prescription". For the d-quark, the main problem is caused by the term involving the δ(1 - x) contribution. It is these large terms at x = 1 which cause the QCD sum rules analysis to break down.

The origin of the [formula] terms which give the large O(αsa2) corrections is particularly worrying for all QCD sum rules calculations of operator moments. They arise from the exchange of a virtual gluon in graphs with a single quark propagator. Such configurations occur for all OMEs calculations. Given their importance in leading twist calculations, we feel their magnitude should be computed to determine the reliability of any OME calculation. In particular, the higher twist calculations of [\cite=stein] have not been done to this order so some doubt needs to be cast on them.

In the case of the structure functions, the effect of these terms is apparently absent for values of x  ≠  1. At least for the u-quark, the predictions are in acceptable agreement with experiment. However, the question arises if the analysis is valid. In our opinion, this is debatable, since the large corrections at x = 1 arise from quark kinematics and are not physical, so when comparing to physical data, one can not assume their restriction to x = 1 as was done in [\cite=ioffe-dis]. Indeed the concept of duality tells us that we should average over the cross section for production of quarks and gluons in order to obtain the cross section of a physical process, i.e. one should smear the singularities of quarks. This is what the moments do, as they average over the whole x region of integration 0  ≤  x  ≤  1. While it may be possible to justify averaging over a smaller range of x, any such averaging will introduce sensitivity to the problematic behaviour at x = 1.
