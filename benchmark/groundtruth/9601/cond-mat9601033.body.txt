Introduction

In spite of long history of intensive studies, there are few exact results known on models of spin glasses. To summarize analytical calculations of the ground-state properties of the Ising model, Derrida et al. [\cite=Derrida] investigated linear chains, double-chain strips and the [formula] square lattice systems using a variant of the transfer-matrix method to obtain exact expressions of the ground-state energy. Morita and Horiguchi [\cite=Morita] and Fechner and Błaszyk [\cite=Fechner] investigated the linear triangular chain by summing up all the configurations of frustrated clusters. They derived analytical expressions of the ground-state energy for these systems. However, their methods are essentially an enumeration of possible configurations and therefore are very difficult to be generalized to systems with larger widths.

Recently, interest in this problem has been renewed by Dress et al. [\cite=Dress] who applied the method of Derrida et al. [\cite=Derrida] to the problem of error-correcting codes. In the present paper, we generalize their method to the calculation of the ground-state energy of the ±  J model and the site-random model on strips of various width. An important reason to consider the latter site-random model is that almost all experiments of spin glasses are carried out on site-random systems. Although bond-random and site-random models would share many important properties, there should exist some distinctions, a part of which is clarified in the present paper. An advantage of this method over the enumeration methods is that ground-state energy of strips of various width with various kinds of randomness can be calculated systematically without elaborate enumeration of configurations.

A useful aspect of the method used in the present paper is that the ground-state energy is obtained for general complex values of parameters to control probabilities of quenched random variables. This is in sharp contrast to the numerical transfer matrix technique which is applicable only to real probabilities. As long as the width of a strip is finite, the ground-state energy of models on the strip is analytic as a function of the probability of quenched randomness if this probability is restricted to real values. However, when the variable to control probability is analytically continued into the complex plane, the ground-state energy is found to have singularities. This analytic continuation into the complex plane is analogous to the idea of Lee-Yang zeros [\cite=Lee-Yang] for complex magnetic fields. Thus, a hint for the singularity of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional spin glass may be obtained from the behavior of the singularities in the complex plane as the width of strip is increased.

In § 2, we explain the formulation of the present method using examples of the width-two (ladder) systems. Explicit formulas of the ground-state energy of the bond-random and site-random models are given. Investigation of systems with widths larger than two needs additional techniques, which are explained in § 3. The exact ground-state energy is given for the case of width three. We could obtain locations of singularities of the ground-state energy only in limited regions of the complex probability plane when the width is four and five. This is due to limitations of computational resources (memory and CPU time). We should stress here that exact analytical expressions, not numerical values, of the ground-state energy can be obtained if sufficient computational power is available. In § 4, behavior of singularities in the complex probability plane is discussed. Differences between bond-random and site-random models are described and their physical implications are discussed.

Formulation of Exact Calculations

In this section, we formulate the procedure for the evaluation of the exact ground-state energy of the ±  J and the site-random models. The width-two (ladder) systems are treated as examples. This formulation is based on the method proposed by Derrida et al. [\cite=Derrida] and Dress et al. [\cite=Dress]. The main problem is how to evaluate averages over the distribution of randomness.

±  J model

First, we consider the ±  J Ising model on a ladder shown in Fig. [\ref=ladderJ]. The Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

where the variable σi(σ'i)  =    ±  1 represents an Ising spin on the upper (lower) line, and the exchange interactions Ki, K'i and Li take the values + 1 or - 1 randomly with the probabilities p or 1 - p, respectively. We calculate the ground-state energy per spin in the limit n  →    ∞  .

As is well-known, transfer-matrix calculation of the partition function of Ising models is based on the constrained partition functions Z±    ±n, in which the boundary spins are fixed as σn,σ'n  =    ±  1 in the 2  ×  n-spin ladder. These constrained partition functions obey the following recursion relation

[formula]

using the transfer matrix Tn given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the zero-temperature limit [formula], we have only to consider the leading term of z, namely,

[formula]

The exponent xn represents the energy of the strip of length n with the boundary condition σ  =  σ'  =    +  1. The exponents an, bn and cn correspond to the differences of energy between the systems with different fixed boundary conditions.

Since we are interested only in the energy, we concentrate on the exponents xn, an, bn and cn. For the asymptotic form ([\ref=zerolim]), the recursion relation ([\ref=recc]) is reduced to with

[formula]

and K  =  Kn + 1, K'  =  K'n + 1 and L  =  Ln + 1. Because of the global reflection symmetry in the spin space, bn is equal to an and cn is equal to zero. Then, the four recursion relations in  ([\ref=recn1])-([\ref=recn4]) are reduced to the following two recursion relations with

[formula]

The ground-state energy per spin is expressed as

[formula]

where the double brackets [formula] represent the average over the bond configuration. The quantity - (xn + 1  -  xn) corresponds to the increase of the energy by the transfer from Zn to Zn + 1. Equation ([\ref=recn5]) means that the quantity (xn + 1  -  xn) is a function of an, Kn + 1, K'n + 1 and Ln + 1. Since Kn + 1, K'n + 1 and Ln + 1 are independent of each other and of an, the probability P(an,Kn + 1,K'n + 1,Ln + 1) is decomposed as P(an)  ·  P(Kn + 1)  ·  P(Kn + 1)  ·  P(Kn + 1). Among the four factors in this product, only the distribution P(an) is nontrivial. The function P(an) can be calculated if we analyze the change of state from the nth stage of transfer to the (n + 1)th stage. Details are explained in Appendix [\ref=apA]. The result is

[formula]

This quantity is plotted as a function of real p between 0 and 1 in Fig. [\ref=2xinf_bond]. Note that this function is symmetric for the exchange of p with 1 - p as it should be.

Site-random model

Next, we consider the site-random Ising model on a ladder. The Hamiltonian is given by the same form as in eq. ([\ref=sgham]), except for the expressions of the exchange interactions Kn, K'n and Ln. The site-random model is composed of A and B ions with concentrations c and 1 - c, respectively. The value of the exchange interaction is + 1 for the neighboring ion pair A-A and is - 1 for A-B and B-B.

Calculations of the ground-state energy in this model can be carried out quite similarly to those of the ±  J model. Formulas ([\ref=sgham]) to ([\ref=Ep]) do not need modifications. Only the evaluation of the final expression ([\ref=Ep]) requires different treatments as explained below.

In the site-random model, the variables Kn + 1, K'n + 1 and Ln + 1 are functions of the type of ions Xn and X'n which are either A or B in the nth row and ions Xn + 1 and X'n + 1 in the (n + 1)th row. Hence, the quantity (xn + 1 - xn) is a function of an, Xn, X'n, Xn + 1 and X'n + 1. Let us remember that the variables Xn + 1 and X'n + 1 located at the edge of the strip are random. That is,

[formula]

where X stands for Xn + 1 or X'n + 1. On the other hand, the variables Xn and X'n are not random, since they can be regarded as having already been fixed in the previous step of transfer. Then, the distribution function is written as

[formula]

The non-trivial part of distribution function is P(an,Xn,X'n). Evaluation of this P(an,Xn,X'n) proceeds quite similarly as in the case of the ±  J model. Details are found in Appendix [\ref=apA]. We obtain the explicit expression of the ground-state energy as

[formula]

The value of this energy is drawn as a function of real c in Fig. [\ref=2xinf_site]. It is seen that this quantity is symmetric under the exchange of c and 1 - c as was discussed generally in Ref. [\cite=sristr].

Systems with Larger Widths

In the present section, we generalize the method explained in the previous section to strips with width lager than two for the ±  J and the site-random models.

In the case of width 3, the constrained partition functions in the low temperature limit is expressed as

[formula]

where the allocation of the exponents xn,an,bn and cn takes the global spin-flip symmetry into account. These exponents satisfy the following recursion relations analogous to eqs. ([\ref=recn5]),([\ref=recn6]):

with

[formula]

where a  =  an, b  =  bn, c  =  cn, K  =  Kn + 1, K'  =  K'n + 1, K''  =  K''n + 1, L  =  Ln + 1 and L'  =  L'n + 1.

We apply the above method to the ±  J and the site-random models. However, as was mentioned in Appendix [\ref=apA], the same approach to the case of width 2 requires a symbolic inverse of a matrix of size [formula] or [formula], which requires exceeding amount of CPU time. The following trick makes it possible to calculate the exact ground-state energy without explicit symbolic inverse of large matrices.

Equation ([\ref=dist]) can be written as

[formula]

where the index [formula] of Pi stands for an element of the set {an} and S̃N,i denotes the co-factor of [formula]. Then, eq. ([\ref=Ep]) is expressed explicitly as

[formula]

Let us recall here that S̃N,i and [formula] are polynomials of p with integer coefficients. Since it is easy to calculate S̃N,i or [formula] for given p numerically, we can determine the coefficients of the polynomials from numerical values at several points: If the degree of the polynomial is m, numerical values of the polynomial at (m + 1) points are sufficient to determine the exact values of coefficients. The same technique holds for the site-random model.

In this way we have carried out the average of eq. ([\ref=Ep]) and obtained the ground-state energy as

[formula]

with

[formula]

in the ±  J model, and

[formula]

with

[formula]

in the site-random model. These results ([\ref=fracEp]) and ([\ref=fracEc]) are plotted as functions of p or c in Figs. [\ref=3xinf_br] and [\ref=3xinf_sr].

In the case of width 4, the number of the bases of the transition matrix S defined in Appendix [\ref=apA] exceeds two hundred. Accordingly the degrees of polynomials of the denominator and numerator of the expression of the energy ([\ref=avE]) are much larger than in the case of width 3. Thus we have to determine the coefficients of polynomials of very large degrees from numerical values of the polynomials at many points. This procedure requires prohibitively high-precision calculations, which we were not able to perform.

Instead, we determined the locations of singularities (where [formula]) in restricted regions of the complex probability plane. First, the value of [formula] is scanned in the complex plane with the interval of 0.01 for real and imaginary parts of p or c. Zeros of [formula] correspond to the crossing points of two sets of curves, the first one corresponding to [null]  =  0 and the second to [null]  =  0. These curves are displayed in Fig. [\ref=curve]. Thus, the regions in which zeros are likely to be located are specified from the crossing points. Next, the zeros in the specified regions are precisely evaluated numerically using the subroutine of finding zeros of a function in the complex plane. In some cases, zeros of [formula] coincide with zeros of the numerator of eq. ([\ref=avE]). In such cases the energy is not singular. This type of zeros of [formula] should be excluded from our considerations. Direct numerical evaluation of the energy at such points reveals whether or not a zero of [formula] is a real singularity of the energy. We have in this way singled out real singularities of the energy. Note that the present method gives much more precise results than directly locating divergences of the energy in the complex plane which accompanies large rounding errors.

In the present analyses, we have concentrated on the region [formula] and [formula] due to the limit of computational time. Although some singularities lie outside this region, physically important ones are located near the real axis in the range [formula]. Therefore, for the purpose of investigation of effects of singularities in real physical systems, it is sufficient to concentrate our attention to the above mentioned region in the complex plane.

In the case of width 5, we could locate only one singularity nearest to the range [formula] for the ±  J model by using the same method as the case of width 4. The site-random model was not investigated for the width 5.

Let us note that the unit of strips is not limited to squares. For example, a strip composed of triangles can be treated, as shown explicitly for the case of width 2 in Appendix [\ref=apB].

Summary and Discussion

In the present paper, we have generalized the method for the calculation of the exact ground-state energy proposed by Derrida et al. [\cite=Derrida] and Dress et al. [\cite=Dress]. The ground-state energy of finite-width strips can be obtained by using this method.

We have applied the method to the ±  J Ising model on strips with width 2 to 5 and the site-random Ising model with width 2 to 4. In the case of widths 2 and 3, the exact ground-state energy and the singularities in the complex-probability plane of randomness have been obtained explicitly. In the case of width 4 and 5, the exact location of singularities near the physical region ([formula]) have been identified by numerical calculation.

In the ±  J model, Fig. [\ref=singular](a), there seems to exist a series of singularities which may approach a limiting point around p  ~  0.9 on the real axis as the size of the strip grows. In the site-random model, Fig. [\ref=singular](b), such series does not seem to exist within the present calculations. These results suggest that the ground-state energy of the ±  J model may have a singularity at the critical concentration pc  ~  0.89, [\cite=2DIs] and that the ground-state energy of the site-random model does not have any singularity at the critical concentration cc  ~  0.63 [\cite=sristr]. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the significance of these observations.

Evaluation of the Functions P(an) and P(an,Xn,X'n)

The recursion relation ([\ref=recn6]) has a stationary distribution P(an). As has been mentioned in § [\ref=sec21], the explicit form of this distribution function is necessary for exact calculation of the ground-state energy. It is found easily by explicit iteration of the recursion relation ([\ref=recn6]) starting from various finite values of an that the set {an} is restricted to a closed finite one. That is, we find {an}  =  {2,1,0, - 1, - 2} in the ±  J model of width 2. Similarly, in the site-random model with width 2, it is necessary to obtain the joint distribution function P(an,Xn,X'n) as explained in § [\ref=sec22]. It is again found by explicit iteration that the set {an,Xn,X'n} consists of (0,A,A), ( - 1,A,A), ( - 2,A,A), (0,A,B), ( - 1,A,B), ( - 2,A,B), (0,B,A), ( - 1,B,A), ( - 2,B,A), (2,B,B), (1,B,B) and (0,B,B) as the stationary state of the recursion relation ([\ref=recn6]).

Bearing these observations in mind, we construct a matrix S which transforms an to an + 1. In the case of the ±  J model with width 2, we find from eq. ([\ref=recn6])

[formula]

with q  =  1 - p. The stationary distribution P(an) is given by the eigenvector of S with the eigenvalue unity:

[formula]

where P(an) satisfies

[formula]

It is convenient to introduce the matrix [formula] defined by

[formula]

where N denotes the size of the set {an} (N  =  5 in the case of eq. ([\ref=transit])). Then eqs. ([\ref=a2]) and ([\ref=a3]) are written in a single relation

[formula]

Thus, we obtain

[formula]

Similarly, in the case of the site-random model with width 2, the distribution function can be obtained by using the transition matrix

[formula]

The matrix S or [formula] depends on models. The size of the matrix increases exponentially as the system size increases. The sizes of the matrices are 5, 28, 286, 3400 for widths 2, 3, 4, 5 in the ±  J model, and 12, 60, 528 for widths 2, 3, 4 in the site-random model. Thus the explicit evaluation of an inverse matrix by symbolic manipulation becomes difficult.

Strip Consisting of Triangles

We have calculated the ground-state energy of the one-dimensional ±  J model on the linear triangular chain (Fig. [\ref=triangle]) by using the same method. The ground-state energy is given by

[formula]

This model has already been "solved" by Fechner and Błaszyk [\cite=Fechner]. Although this expression is consistent with their Fig. 3, their expression of the ground-state energy is neither consistent with this expression nor with their own figure.
