Effects of Parton kT in High-pT Particle Production

Introduction

Direct-photon production has long been viewed as an ideal process for measuring the gluon distribution in the proton [\cite=halzen]. The quark-gluon Compton scattering subprocess (gq  →  γq) provides a large contribution to inclusive γ production for which the cross sections have been calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) [\cite=aurenche]. The gluon distribution in the proton is relatively well-constrained at x < 0.1 by deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and Drell-Yan (DY) data, but less so at larger x. Consequently, direct-photon data from fixed-target experiments can, in principle, provide an important constraint on the gluon content at moderate to large x.

However, a pattern of deviations has been observed between the measured direct-photon cross sections and NLO calculations [\cite=cteqkt]. The discrepancy is particularly striking in the recently published higher-statistics data from E706 [\cite=e706], for both direct-photon and π0 cross sections. The final direct-photon results from UA6 [\cite=ua6] also exhibit evidence of similar, although smaller, discrepancies. The suspected origin of the disagreement is from effects of soft-gluon radiation. Such radiation generates transverse components of initial-state parton momenta, referred to in this discussion as kT. (To be precise, kT denotes the magnitude of the effective transverse momentum vector, [formula], of each of the two colliding partons.)

Evidence of significant kT has long been observed in production of muon, photon, and jet pairs. A collection of measurements of the average transverse momentum of the pairs (〈pT〉pair) is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:pairpt], for a wide range of center-of-mass energies ([formula]). The values of 〈pT〉pair are large, and increase slowly with increasing [formula]. The values of 〈kT〉 per parton (estimated as ≈  〈pT〉pair/[formula]) indicated by these DY, diphoton, and dijet data, as well as the inclusive direct-photon and π0 production data, are too large to be interpreted as "intrinsic" -- i.e., due only to the finite size of the proton. (From the observed data, one can infer that the average kT per parton is about 1 GeV/c at fixed-target energies, increasing to 3-4 GeV/c at the Tevatron collider, while one would expect 〈kT〉 values on the order of 0.3-0.5 GeV/c based solely on proton size.) Perturbative QCD (PQCD) corrections at NLO level are also insufficient to explain the size of the observed effects, and, in fact, full resummation calculations are required to describe DY and W/Z [\cite=ellis] [\cite=WZ] [\cite=resbos], and diphoton [\cite=fergani] [\cite=diphoton] distributions. Similar soft-gluon (or kT) effects can be expected in all hard-scattering processes, such as the inclusive production of jets or direct photons [\cite=FF] [\cite=cont].

After reviewing a phenomenological model for kT effects in direct-photon production we will discuss its applications to data, as well as the implications for determining the gluon distribution. A more detailed presentation of these results can be found in [\cite=ktpheno].

kT Smearing Model

The Collins-Soper-Sterman resummation formalism [\cite=css] provides a rigorous basis for theoretical understanding of soft-gluon radiation effects. Despite recent progress [\cite=mang] [\cite=ster], no full treatment of inclusive direct-photon cross sections is yet available. In its absence, we use a PQCD-based model that incorporates transverse kinematics of initial-state partons to study the major consequences of kT for direct-photon production (and, by extension, for all hard-scattering processes).

In PQCD, the expression for the leading-order (LO) cross section for direct-photon production at large pT has the form:

[formula]

where σ̂ is the hard-scattering matrix element, and fa1 / h1 and fa2 / h2 are the parton distribution functions (pdf) for the colliding partons a1 and a2 in hadrons h1 and h2, respectively. To introduce kT degrees of freedom, we extend each integral over the parton distribution functions to the kT-space,

[formula]

and take [formula]) to be a Gaussian (as justified, e.g., by E706 data on high-mass pairs),

[formula]

Here, 〈k2T〉 is the square of the 2-dimensional RMS width of the kT distribution for one parton and is related to the square of the average of the absolute value of [formula] of one parton through 〈k2T〉 = 4〈kT〉2  /  π.

Since an exact treatment of the modified parton kinematics can be implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, but is more difficult in an analytic approach, it is convenient to employ Monte Carlo techniques in evaluating the cross sections according to the above prescription. In general, because the unmodified PQCD cross sections fall rapidly with increasing pT, the net effect of kT smearing is to increase the expected yield. We denote the enhancement factor as K(pT).

A Monte Carlo program that includes such a treatment of kT smearing, and the LO cross section for high-pT particle production, has long been available [\cite=owensll]. The program provides calculations of many experimental observables, and can be used for direct photons, jets, and for single high-pT particles resulting from jet fragmentation (such as inclusive π0 production). Unfortunately, no such program is available for NLO calculations, but one can approximate the effect of kT smearing by multiplying the NLO cross sections by the LO kT-enhancement factor. Admittedly, this procedure involves a risk of double-counting since some of the kT-enhancement may already be contained in the NLO calculation. However, we expect such double-counting effects to be small.

A complete treatment of soft-gluon radiation in high-pT production, should eventually predict the effective kT values expected for each process and [formula]. We will employ 〈kT〉 values representative of those found in comparisons of kinematic distributions in high-mass pair data with the above described model.

Applications of the kT Model to Data

The experimental consequences of kT smearing are expected to depend on the collision energy. At the Tevatron collider, the smallest photon pT values probed by the CDF and DØ experiments are rather large (10-15 GeV/c), and the kT-enhancement factors modify only the very lowest end of the pT spectrum, where pT is not significantly greater than kT. In the E706 energy range, large kT-effects can modify both the normalizations and the shapes of the cross sections as a function of pT. Consequently, E706 data provide a particularly sensitive test of the kT model. At lower fixed-target energies, the kT enhancements are expected to have less pT dependence over the range of available measurements, and can therefore be masked more easily by uncertainties in experimental normalizations and/or choices of theoretical scales. Nonetheless, the UA6 and WA70 data generally support expectations from kT smearing.

Comparisons to Tevatron Collider Data

At the Tevatron collider, the above model of soft-gluon radiation leads to a relatively small modification of the NLO cross section. In Fig. [\ref=fig:cdfd0] we compare the CDF and DØ isolated direct-photon cross sections [\cite=cdfd0phot] to theoretical NLO calculations with and without kT enhancement. In the lower part of the plot we display the quantity (Data-Theory)/Theory, for NLO theory without the kT-enhancement factor, and the expected effect from kT for 〈kT〉 = 3.5 GeV/c. This is the approximate value of 〈kT〉 per parton measured in diphoton production at the Tevatron [\cite=cdfd0phot], and one expects a similar 〈kT〉 per parton for single-photon production. (In the diphoton process, the 4-vectors of the photons can be measured precisely, providing a direct determination of the transverse momentum of the diphoton system, and thereby 〈kT〉.)

As seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:cdfd0], the kT effect diminishes rapidly with increasing pT, and is essentially negligible above ≈  30 GeV/c. The trend of deviations of NLO calculations from the measured inclusive cross sections is described reasonably well by the expected kT effect. Some of the observed excess can be attributed to the fragmentation effects in the isolated direct-photon production [\cite=gordon], but this alone cannot account for the entire deviation of the theory from data.

Comparisons to E706 Data

The conventional (〈kT〉=0) NLO calculations yield cross sections that are signficantly below the E706 direct-photon and π0 measurements [\cite=e706] (see Fig. [\ref=fig:xs530]). No choices of current parton distributions, or conventional PQCD scales, provide an adequate description of the data (for the presented comparisons all QCD scales have been set to pT/2). The previously described kT-enhancement algorithm was used to incorporate the effects of soft-gluon radiation in the calculated yields. That is, the theory results plotted in the figures represent the NLO calculations multiplied by kT-enhancement factors K(pT).

As seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:xs530], the NLO theory, when supplemented with appropriate kT enhancements, is successful in describing both the shape and normalization of the E706 direct-photon cross sections at both [formula] = 31.6 GeV and 38.8 GeV. As expected, the kT-enhancement factors affect the normalization of the cross sections, as well as the shapes of the pT distributions. The values of 〈kT〉 = 1.2 GeV/c at [formula] = 31.6 GeV, and 1.3 GeV/c at [formula] = 38.8 GeV, provide good representations of the incident-proton data. Both 〈kT〉 values are consistent with those emerging from a comparison of the same PQCD Monte Carlo with E706 data on the production of high-mass π0π0, γπ0, and γγ pairs [\cite=e706]. Similar conclusions are reached from comparisons between calculations and E706 data for π-Be interactions at [formula] = 31.1 GeV (not shown).

For comparison, results of calculations using 〈kT〉 values ±  0.2 GeV/c relative to the central values are also shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:xs530]. These can be taken as an indication of uncertainties on 〈kT〉, on the basis of several considerations. These include: (i) the range of kT values inferred from different distributions in the E706 high-mass pair data; (ii) differences observed between photon and π0 results; (iii) comparisons of 〈kT〉 values required in inclusive cross sections with those representing the properties of massive pairs at E706 and WA70/UA6 energies, and (iv) the differences between dimuon, diphoton, and dijet values of 〈pT〉pair seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:pairpt]. Examples of enhancement factors K(pT) for fixed-target experiments are displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:kfac530].

It is interesting to note that, for the fixed-target energy range, the kT enhancement increases at the highest values of pT. The shape of K(pT) can be understood through the following argument. At the low pT end of the measurements, a 〈kT〉  of ≈  1 GeV/c is non-negligible in comparison to the pT in the hard-scattering, and the addition of kT smearing therefore increases the size of the cross section (and steepens the slope). At highest pT (corresponding to large x), the unmodified NLO cross section becomes increasingly steep (due to the rapid fall in parton densities), and hence the effect of kT smearing again becomes larger.

NLO calculations for π0 production have a greater theoretical uncertainty than those for direct-photon production since π0 production involves parton fragmentation. However, the kT effects in π0 production can be expected to be similar to those observed in direct-photon production, and the π0 data can be used to extend tests of the consequences of kT smearing. Figure [\ref=fig:xs530] also shows comparisons between NLO calculations [\cite=aversa] and π0 production data from E706, using BKK fragmentation functions (ff) [\cite=BKK]. The previously described Monte Carlo program was employed to generate kT-enhancement factors for π0 cross sections, and 〈kT〉 per parton values similar to those that provided good agreement for direct-photon data also provide a reasonable description of π0 data. For π0 production, an additional smearing of the transverse momentum expected from jet fragmentation has also been taken into account.

Comparisons to WA70 and UA6 Data

Both WA70 and UA6 have measured direct-photon production with good statistics, and their data have been included in recent global fits to parton distributions. WA70 measured direct-photon and π0 production in pp and π-p collisions at [formula] = 23.0 GeV [\cite=wa70phot], and UA6 has recently published [\cite=ua6] their final results (with substantially reduced uncertainties) for direct-photon production in pp and [formula] collisions at [formula] = 24.3 GeV. These center of mass energies are smaller than those of E706, and the 〈kT〉 values are therefore expected to be smaller (perhaps of order 0.7-0.9 GeV/c, based on Fig. [\ref=fig:pairpt]). WA70 has compared kinematic distributions observed in diphoton events (for π-p interactions) to NLO predictions, and has found that smearing the NLO theory with an additional 〈kT〉 of 0.9±  0.2 GeV/c provides agreement with their data [\cite=wa70diphot]. We therefore use this 〈kT〉 as the central value for the kT-enhancement factors for both experiments, and vary the 〈kT〉 by [formula] GeV/c, as was done with E706. Over the narrower pT range of WA70 and UA6 measurements, the effect of kT is essentially to produce a shift in normalization, as illustrated on the right side of Fig. [\ref=fig:kfac530].

Comparisons of the WA70 direct-photon and π0 cross sections with the kT-enhanced NLO calculations are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:xs280p] (using QCD scales of pT/2). The π0 cross sections both for incident proton and π- beams, and the photon data from incident π- beam, all lie above the NLO calculations for 〈kT〉 = 0, and are in better agreement with the kT-enhanced calculations; only the photon cross section for incident protons seems not to require a kT correction.

The photon and π0 cross sections from UA6 for pp and [formula] scattering are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:xs315p]. The photon cross section for pp interactions lies clearly above the NLO calculation for 〈kT〉 = 0, but is consistent with kT-adjusted calculations for 〈kT〉 in the range of 0.7-0.9 GeV/c. The result for [formula] interactions is also above the unmodified NLO calculation, but requires a smaller value of 〈kT〉. We note that the dominant production mechanisms for the two processes are different: quark-gluon Compton scattering dominates for pp, and [formula] annihilation for [formula] at the UA6 energy. As in the case of E706 and WA70, the UA6 π0 cross sections are higher than the NLO calculation without kT, and can be described much better by introducing kT enhancement.

Impact on the Gluon Distribution

It is now generally accepted that the uncertainty in the gluon distribution at large x is still quite large. Thus, it would appear important to incorporate further constraints on the gluon, especially from direct-photon data. To investigate the impact of kT effects on determinations of the gluon distribution, we have included the E706 direct-photon cross sections for incident protons, along with the DIS and DY data that were used in determining the CTEQ4M pdfs, in a global fit to the parton distribution functions. The CTEQ fitting program was employed to obtain these results [\cite=cteqfit], using the NLO PQCD calculations for direct-photon cross sections, adjusted by the kT-enhancement factors. However, the WA70, UA6, CDF, and DØ data were excluded from this particular fit. The resulting gluon distribution, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:gluons], is similar to CTEQ4M, as might have been expected, since the kT-enhanced NLO cross sections using CTEQ4M provide a reasonable description of the data shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:xs530].

The new MRST gluon distribution [\cite=mrst] (also shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:gluons]) is significantly lower than CTEQ4M at large x. While the MRST fit employs kT enhancements (obtained using an analytic integration technique), it attempts to accommodate the WA70 incident-proton direct-photon data, which does not exhibit an obvious kT effect. In addition, the MRST kT-enhancements are larger than ours at large pT  (see Fig. [\ref=fig:kfac530]), resulting in a smaller gluon at large x [\cite=avkt]. In contrast, the CTEQ4HJ gluon distribution [\cite=cteq4hj], designed to improve the description of the high-pT jet data from CDF in Run IA, is much larger than CTEQ4M in the same x range. This spread of the solutions for the gluon distribution at large x is uncomfortably large, and additional theoretical effort is warranted to properly incorporate the available direct-photon data in the pdf fits.

Conclusions

We have described a phenomenological model in which 〈kT〉 values used in the calculations of kT-enhancements are derived from data. The results are remarkably successful in reconciling the data and theoretical calculations for a broad range of energies. The kT-enhancements improve the agreement of PQCD calculations with E706, UA6, and π- beam WA70 direct-photon cross sections over the full pT range of measurements, as well as with the low-pT end of CDF and DØ results. All discussed fixed-target π0 measurements also agree much better with such kT-enhanced calculations.

A definitive conclusion regarding the quantitative role of kT effects in hard scattering awaits a more rigorous theoretical treatment of soft-gluon radiation. Such theoretical progress is crucial for a more reliable determination of the gluon distribution, especially in the large-x region, where significant uncertainties remain.
