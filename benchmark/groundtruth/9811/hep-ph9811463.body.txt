The recent atmospheric neutrino results from Superkamiokande (SK) provide new, and increasingly credible evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations. The atmospheric neutrino data seems consistent with a two-flavor model involving νμ  -  νx oscillations, where νx could either be ντ or a new sterile state νs. The data favors a large ([formula]) mixing angle, with Δm2  ~  10- 2 - 10- 3  ~  eV2 [\cite=sup]. The solar neutrino data is consistent [\cite=bah] both with the vacuum solution in which Δm2  ~  5  ·  10- 11 - 10- 10  ~  eV2 and sin 22θ  ~  0.7 - 1.0, or the small mixing angle MSW solution with sin 22θ  ~  (few)·  10- 3 and Δm2  ~  (few)·  10- 6  ~  eV2. The 'vacuum' solution strongly indicates oscillations between active neutrinos, while the MSW solution can involve either an active or sterile neutrino [\cite=bah].

The importance of the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments stems from the fact that they may provide the first unequivocal evidence for physics beyond the standard model. It is hard to see how neutrino masses of order 10- 1 eV (or greater) can be generated within the framework of the standard model (SM) or its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM), even after non-renormalizable interactions are taken into account. Some extension of this framework is mandated, and perhaps the most elegant possibility is to introduce right handed neutrinos which, when coupled with the seesaw mechanism [\cite=seesaw], gives rise to neutrino masses and mixings. There are well known extensions of the SM, such as SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R [\cite=pati], SO(10) [\cite=so10] or flipped SU(5) [\cite=flip], which all predict the existence of right-handed neutrinos, and consequently non-zero neutrino masses and mixings.

A consistent theoretical framework for understanding the neutrino oscillation parameters allowed by experiments should also shed light on the observed charged fermion mass hierarchies and the magnitude of the CKM matrix elements. It seems natural to think that there exists some 'flavor' (horizontal) symmetry that distinguishes between the generations. In the supersymmetric setting, a global U(1)-R-symmetry would provide an example of such a symmetry. Note that the flavor symmetry need not be continuous, and indeed some superstring inspired models suggest the existence of discrete flavor 'gauge' symmetries.

In this letter we would like to develop a unified approach, based on νMSSM (MSSM augmented with the seesaw mechanism) and its grand unified extensions, that incorporates the various two-flavor oscillation solutions allowed by the data. Our approach is strongly guided by the desire to provide a general mechanism for realizing (essentially) maximal mixing in νμ  -  νx oscillations, which seems to be favored experimentally, to explain the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. The scheme that we propose here exploits a U(1) flavor symmetry [\cite=u1], whose breaking by a νMSSM singlet field X yields an important 'expansion' parameter [formula], where MP  =  2.4  ·  1018 GeV denotes the reduced Planck scale. In νMSSM the elements of the quark and lepton Yukawa matrices are expressed in powers of the expansion parameter ε, while in GUTs another dimensionless parameter [formula] can also play a role.

A brief summary of our paper is as follows. Within the framework of νMSSM supplemented by a U(1) flavor symmetry, we find (see also [\cite=ram]) that the SK data can be accommodated by implementing νμ  -  ντ oscillations with large mixing to explain the atmospheric anomaly, while the solar neutrino puzzle is resolved via the small mixing angle MSW solution. This scheme has the distinctive features that it does not require the existence of any sterile neutrino, has no 'hot' dark matter, and can be extended, more or less straightforwardly, to SU(5). One of its disadvantages is that some tuning of the parameters (with ~  1% accuracy) is required in order to achieve the correct magnitudes for the mass squared differences Δm2atm and Δm2solar. Perhaps a more serious shortcoming of this scheme is that it is not clear how to extend it to other interesting gauge groups such as SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R, SO(10) [\cite=babu] and flipped SU(5).

We propose a rather general mechanism for realizing (essentially) maximal νμ  -  νx mixings to explain the atmospheric anomaly. This mechanism inevitably requires the existence of a 'light' sterile neutrino νs in order to provide a simultaneous resolution of the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies. We show how the various two-flavor neutrino oscillation scenarios are naturally realized within the νMSSM (more precisely perhaps νsMSSM to emphasize the presence of a sterile neutrino) framework. The existence of neutrino 'hot' dark matter is noted in models that exhibit either bi-maximal neutrino mixing or maximal νμ  -  νs and small angle νe  -  ντ oscillations. The scenario here with bi-maximal neutrino mixings differs from those considered in ref. [\cite=bimax], since it involves a sterile neutrino state. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach to models beyond νMSSM, we show how it resolves the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles in flipped SU(5).

We begin with the quark sector and choose the U(1) flavor charge of the superfield X to be QX = 1. Expressed in terms of ε, the magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements Vus and Vcb are as follows:

[formula]

from which,

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=Qq]) automatically gives Qq3 - Qq1 = 3, so that Vub  ~  ε3, which indeed is of the right magnitude. From the known mass hierarchies of the up and down quarks, we have the following ratios of the asymptotic Yukawa couplings:

[formula]

[formula]

which, taking into account ([\ref=Qq]), gives

[formula]

[formula]

Expressions ([\ref=Qq]) and ([\ref=Qqr]) determine the structures of the Yukawa matrices of the up and down quarks (throughout the paper the matrix elements are only determined up to factors of order unity; we also ignore CP violation):

[formula]

As emphasized by several authors [\cite=u1], the flavor U(1) symmetry can provide a nice understanding of the quark mass hierarchies as well as the CKM mixing angles.

Turning to the lepton sector, let us remark that neutrino oscillations arise from a nontrivial lepton mixing matrix

[formula]

where Ue and Uν respectively diagonalize the left-handed charged lepton and neutrino 'Dirac' mass matrices, and Vν diagonalizes the matrix mdiagDM- 1RmdiagD (mD and MR denote the 'Dirac' and 'Majorana' mass matrices respectively). Clearly, rotations of the left-handed states [formula] only partially determine the VνCKM mixing angles. It seems reasonable to begin the study of lepton mixings with the charged lepton sector, since our knowledge about masses in this sector is so well established.

The well-known hierarchies among the Yukawa couplings of the charged leptons can be written:

[formula]

from which we conclude that:

[formula]

From ([\ref=Qs]), through proper prescription of the charges of l and ec states, we obtain the following possible choices for the structure of Ye:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the U(1) charges are

[formula]

[formula]

For generating neutrino masses through seesaw mechanism one has to introduce right handed νc states. In models such as SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R, SO(10) and flipped SU(5) these states are embedded in the unified multiplets. Considering three νc states with the following U(1) charges:

[formula]

the 'Dirac' and 'Majorana' mass matrices will have the forms:

[formula]

[formula]

where M is some mass scale.

From ([\ref=dir]), the contributions from mD to VνCKM (namely the elements of Uν) are θν12  ~  εk, θν23  ~  εn, θν13  ~  εn + k. Note that the diagonalization of the matrix mD does not change the hierarchical structure of the matrix MR. As far as the elements of the Vν matrix are concerned, they are determined from the matrix

[formula]

which gives θ12'  ~  εk, θ23'  ~  εn, θ13'  ~  εn + k. From ([\ref=mactive])we have for the masses of the light neutrinos:

[formula]

The mixing angles and masses of the left handed neutrinos do not depend on the U(1) charges of the νc states.

The case with n = 0 leads to the desirable large νμ  -  ντ mixing. According to ([\ref=nu132s1]) this case also gives mν2  ~  mν3. To solve solar neutrino puzzle through νe  -  νμ oscillations, we need some fine tunings in order to realize a suitably small mass for the `ν'2 state. For k = 0 the solar neutrino puzzle can be resolved through the large angle vacuum oscillations, while k = 2 would suggest small angle MSW oscillations. However, in these cases fine tunings to accuracies ~  0.01% and 1% respectively must be done. To avoid this 'unpleasant' fact, one can either introduce a sterile neutrino state for solution of the solar neutrino puzzle through small angle MSW oscillations, or perhaps put forward another mechanism for keeping the `ν2' neutrino light. The two cases (with (n, ~ k) = (0, ~ 2) and (n, ~ k) = (0, ~ 0)), as pointed out in [\cite=ram], can be realized in MSSM and SU(5) GUT respectively.

In many realistic unified theories, however, the choice n = 0 is not realized and so the contributions to the lepton mixing matrix in ([\ref=nuckm]) from the neutral sector are critical if the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is to be resolved. The neutrino 'Dirac' mass matrices in models such as flipped SU(5), SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R and SO(10) mostly have the same 'hierarchical' structure as the mass matrices of up quarks (or leptons in some special cases). This means that the contributions from Vν to the lepton mixing matrix will also be small if n  ≠  0 , unless the neutral sector of the models are suitably modified. As we will see, with our approach this also opens up the possibility of realizing the other allowed two-flavor oscillation solutions within the framework of realistic SUSY GUTs (as well as νMSSM). The mechanism that we propose naturally leads to maximal mixing between two oscillating neutrino flavors, and turns out to be a powerful tool for model building. By this mechanism a quasi degenerate texture for the mass matrix of the two flavors are obtained, and so the masses of the appropriate neutrino states cannot be changed through fine tunings. For an explanation of atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies we led to introduce a sterile neutrino state νs.

The introduction of the sterile state opens up the following scenarios (that are consistent with the latest solar and atmospheric neutrino data):

a) Atmospheric anomaly is explained through maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing, while the solar neutrino puzzle is resolved by small angle MSW νe  -  νs oscillations.

b) Deficit of atmospheric neutrinos is due to maximal νμ  -  νs mixings and maximal νe  -  ντ mixing resolves the solar neutrino anomaly (bi-maximal mixing scenario).

c) Atmospheric neutrino anomalies still explained by maximal angle νμ  -  νs oscillations, while the solar neutrino puzzle is resolved through small angle νe  -  ντ MSW oscillations. Below we will present a detailed discussion of how these scenarios are realized, and their phenomenological implications in a model independent way.

Let us demonstrate the mechanism by obtaining maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing, but it can work for any two flavors. We will show mechanism how to obtain large mixing for n  ≠  0 (this case can include the choice k = 0 ). We introduce two MSSM singlet superfields N2,3, which couple with νe,μ,τ to form the Dirac matrix. Their U(1) charges are as follows:

[formula]

where p, r are integers, and 0 < p  ≤  n  ≠  0, r  ≥  0 (it is important to have QN3 > 0 and QN3 + Ql3 + Qhu > 0; we also took Ql3 = Qhu = 0 for a simpler presentation). The 'Dirac' and 'Majorana' mass matrices turn out to be

[formula]

Here κ and M respectively denote some coupling constant and mass scale and depend on the details of the model. The light chiral neutrinos will acquire mass through the seesaw mechanism. Namely,

[formula]

From ([\ref=nu2]) we see that two states are quasi-degenerate with masses mν2≃mν3≃m and the third ν1 state is massless since the matrix ([\ref=nu2]) is obtained by the exchange of the two heavy singlet states. The matrix in ([\ref=nu2]) generate desired (essentially) maximal mixing [\cite=bin] in the νμ  -  ντ sector.

As may be expected, there is no dependence in ([\ref=nu2]) on the U(1)-charges of N2, N3. For the neutrino oscillation parameters we find:

[formula]

[formula]

For n = 1, m  ~  0.1 eV, or n = 2, m  ~  0.2 eV, one can obtain a value for Δm2μτ(~  3  ×  10- 3  ~  eV2) that is consistent with the atmospheric neutrino results. For either case n = 1 or 2, the model must be arranged such that these values for m are realized. Note that the neutrino masses in both cases are much too small for any significant contribution to hot dark matter.

However, the masses are sufficiently large (!) that the solution of the solar neutrino puzzle requires a sterile neutrino νs [\cite=foot]. The relevant superpotential couplings are:

[formula]

The coefficients Γ and ms should be strongly suppressed in order to guarantee a light νe  -  νs system. This can be realized with a U(1)-R symmetry [\cite=chun] [\cite=61] [\cite=422]. With the oscillation parameters

[formula]

[formula]

one finds

[formula]

The couplings of more heavy νμ and ντ states with νs are expected to be of the order of [formula]. Taking into account ([\ref=cond]) and ([\ref=nust]) we will have [formula] eV, which do not exceed to m and therefore the results presented above will be unchanged.

The above discussion shows how one can obtain maximal mixing between two 'active' neutrinos, in this case νμ, ντ, which is in good agreement with the atmospheric neutrino experiments. This scenario is accompanied by the small mixing angle MSW solution involving νe  -  νs. We now consider how an alternate description is possible in which νμ  -  νs oscillations resolve the atmospheric anomaly, while νe  -  ντ vacuum oscillations resolve the solar neutrino puzzle. It turns out that this 'bi-maximal' mixing scenario permits the existence of neutrino hot dark matter, with contribution to the cosmological density parameter of 0.2 - 0.25. Models of structure formation with both cold and hot dark matter [\cite=cdmat] are in good agreement with the observations.

We introduce the MSSM singlet states N1,3 and νs, such that

[formula]

(0 < p'  ≤  n + k,  r'  ≥  0). The relevant superpotential couplings involving the N states are

[formula]

The sterile state νs is required to have large mixing with νμ. This means that its U(1) charge must be such that it avoids forming a 'heavy' state with ντ. This is easily achieved if 1  ≤  Qνs  ≤  n, in which case the mass term for νs will also be forbidden. Consider the superpotential couplings

[formula]

Taking into account the couplings ([\ref=nuNNN1]), ([\ref=numus]) and integrating out the heavy N1,3 states, the mass matrix for the active and sterile neutrinos takes the form:

[formula]

where [formula], and we have defined [formula]. ms is the mass of the sterile neutrino. Farther we will assume that ms  ≪  m. The required suppressions of Γ' and ms can be achieved with the help of U(1) symmetry ([\cite=chun] [\cite=61] [\cite=422]).

From ([\ref=nus]) we see that νe  -  ντ and νμ  -  νs form massive states,

[formula]

and for the oscillation parameters we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

To obtain Δm2eτ≃10- 10  ~  eV2 in ([\ref=shift13]), for [formula], the m' should be taken in the range ~  2  ·  10- 5 - 4  ·  10- 4 eV respectively. The first term in ([\ref=shift2s]) does not give significant contribution to the Δm2μs (for allowed values of m' and n + k). The required splitting can occur due to ms. For ms  ~  5  ·  10- 4 eV, m can be ~  3 eV, corresponding to neutrino hot dark matter ~  15% of the critical energy density. For larger ms (say ~  2  ·  10- 2 eV), m should be taken less then ~  1 eV, which implies a non-significant contribution to dark matter.

In summary, the existence of neutrino hot dark matter is predicted in models in which νμ  -  νs oscillations with large mixing explain the atmospheric neutrino anomaly, while the large angle νe  -  ντ vacuum oscillations resolve the solar neutrino puzzle.

In obtaining maximal mixing between 'active' neutrinos the forms of matrices in ([\ref=nu2]), ([\ref=nus]) is crucial, and for the mechanism to work, one has to make sure that the 'zero' entries in these matrices will not be (radically) changed. The zero entries were guaranteed by the U(1) symmetry (see couplings in ([\ref=mats]), ([\ref=nuNNN1])), and in νMSSM there is no additional source which could change the picture. However, in models such as flipped SU(5), SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R, or SO(10) , in addition to the MSSM 'matter' content, we also have the MSSM singlet states νci with 'Dirac' couplings to the left handed neutrinos. Through the seesaw mechanism, they give rise to an additional contribution mν' to the neutrino mass matrix. The magnitudes of the appropriate entries of mν' depend on the specifics of the model, but for the scenario to work, these must be [formula] (see ([\ref=nu2])). One way to achieve this is to introduce additional 'matter' singlet (N) states. If N and νc superfields form large massive states M0νcN, and the terms lNhu and N2 either do not exist or are strongly suppressed (this could be arranged by the U(1) symmetry), it is easy to verify that after integrating out of the heaviest νc - N states, the neutrino masses will not receive significant contributions from the 'physics of νc sector', and the large νμ  -  ντ (νe  -  ντ) mixings will be realized. We will demonstrate this shortly with an explicit example based on flipped SU(5).

Before discussing this case, however, let us mention another possible scenario in which νe  -  ντ small angle MSW oscillations resolve the solar neutrino puzzle. Since the ντ state must be light it should not mix strongly with νμ. Since in this case we do not deal with large mixings between the active neutrino states we do not need to apply mechanism presented (involving N states) above. It turns out that this case predicts the heaviest neutrinos to be [formula] eV. Within the framework of νMSSM and some of its extensions, the mass matrix of the active neutrinos is expected to be as given by ([\ref=mactive]), with νe  -  ντ mixing ~  εn + k. For small angle MSW solution, a good choice is n + k = 2, and m'( = mτ)  ~  (10- 3 - 5  ·  10- 3) eV, which means that we need a sterile state νs to explain the atmospheric anomaly. To avoid large ντ  -  νs mixing, n must differ from zero. With the help of U(1) symmetry, νμ will form a 'degenerate' massive state with νs (mν2≃mνs). Having Couplings [formula], the whole neutrino mass matrix will have the form:

[formula]

where we will still assume that ms  ≪  m.

For the oscillation parameters we will have:

[formula]

[formula]

Two cases which give different implications should be considered: (i) For ms  ~  5  ·  10- 4 eV in order to get Δm2μs  ~  3  ·  10- 3  ~  eV2 (for either n = 1 or 2) the value for m should be taken (according to ([\ref=dif])) m  ~  3 eV; (ii ) For an increased value of ms, say ~  1.5  ·  10- 3 eV, (for either n = 1 or 2) m should be taken m  ~  1 eV, which is already not enough to have any appreciable neutrino hot dark matter. As we see the case (i) gives the possibility of existence of the neutrino hot dark matter also in this scenario.

To demonstrate how the scenarios discussed above can be realized in realistic models beyond νMSSM and, in particular, how the mechanisms work in practice, let us consider the flipped SU(5) model [\cite=flip]. We picked this model especially since the U(1) charges of the 'matter' superfields are rather precisely determined. The matter content of the model is :

[formula]

where i = 1,2,3 denotes the family index. Their 'gauge' U(1) charges are 1, - 3 and 5 respectively. Similarly the 'higgs' multiplets are :

[formula]

with U(1) charges - 2, 2, 1 and - 1 respectively. The VEVs of the scalar components of H, superfields break SU(5)  ×  U(1) to SU(3)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y. The well known doublet-triplet splitting problem is solved through the missing partner mechanism [\cite=flip].

The superpotential couplings which generate the quark, 'Dirac' and charged lepton masses are:

[formula]

where i,j are family indices. The matrices A, B, C have entries that depend on powers of ε. It is easy to see that the desired hierarchy ([\ref=lambdaud]) for the down quarks is achieved if the U(1) charges of 10i are related as follows:

[formula]

From ([\ref=Q10]) and the known hierarchies of the up quark Yukawa couplings ([\ref=lambdaud]), we also have:

[formula]

Similarly, from ([\ref=lamdae]) and ([\ref=Q5]) we find:

[formula]

Given ([\ref=Q10]), ([\ref=Q5]) and ([\ref=Q1]), we can determine the structure of the Yukawa matrices A,B,C:

[formula]

[formula]

where 0  ≤  a  ≤  2 determines the value of the MSSM parameter tan β([formula]).

Since the left handed leptons are contained in the [formula]-plets, from ([\ref=Q5]) and ([\ref=lep3]), we see that we are dealing with the case (n, ~ k) = (2,2). Therefore, without some suitable extension of this minimal scheme, we expect the νμ  -  ντ mixing angle θμτ  ~  ε2, in strong disagreement with the data. The choice (n, ~ k) = (2,2) tells us that we should suitably enlarge the model, so as to accommodate large angle νμ  -  ντ oscillations for the atmospheric anomaly, while the solar neutrino puzzle can be resolved through the small mixing angle (MSW) oscillations of νe into a sterile state νs (the other two scenarios, it turns out, either give mνμ  ~  1 keV or θeτ  ~  ε4, both of which are unacceptable).

To implement this scenario, we will take the horizontal U(1) symmetry to be an R symmetry. This will be crucial for the natural generation of appropriate mass scales in the neutrino sector. We introduce the singlet states N2, N3 and νs. Let us prescribe the following R charges to the various superfields:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and RX remain undetermined. This choice corresponds to a = 2 in ([\ref=ABC]), which means that the MSSM parameter tan β is not too far from unity.

The superpotential couplings involving N2, N3 fields are

[formula]

We see from ([\ref=Nflip]) that the coefficient κ  ~  εG(=  MGUT / MP), the mass scale M  ~  MPε4G (see ([\ref=mats])), and m  ~  κ2〈hu〉2 / M  ~  〈hu〉2 / (MPε2G)≃0.13 eV, which is precisely what is needed for the n = 2 case (see discussion after ([\ref=atm])). Here p = 1, ~ r = 0 and n  →  n + 1, ~ k  →  k + 1 (what matters are the relative values of the U(1) charges). After integrating out the N states, the νμ  -  ντ mass matrix will have precisely the desired form ([\ref=nu2]). We therefore should expect νμ  -  ντ oscillations with the parameters given by ([\ref=atm]).

The allowed couplings [formula] generate masses for νc states which, through the seesaw mechanism, yield contribution to the (2,2) element of matrix ([\ref=nu2]) ~  〈hu〉2 / (MPε2Gε2)≃3 eV. This would spoil the picture of maximal mixing in the νμ  -  ντ sector. For things to work out, we introduce additional singlet superfields Ni (one per generation), with R charges RNi = R / 2 + (4 - i)RX. With the couplings [formula] permitted, but the couplings NiNj and [formula] forbidden by the R-symmetry, integration of the heaviest N - νc states will not yield any contribution to the light neutrino masses. We have also checked that after integration of N - νc states, the forms of couplings ([\ref=Nflip]) are not changed. In other words, maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing through our mechanism can be realized in flipped SU(5).

The resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle requires a sterile state νs with R charge given by Rνs = (R - Rφ) / 2 - RH - 17RX. The relevant couplings are:

[formula]

from which, the corresponding mass scales are

[formula]

Comparison with expression ([\ref=nust]) shows that the solar neutrino puzzle is resolved via the small mixing angle MSW solution.

In conclusion, we have presented a rather general scheme for realizing maximal (and even bi-maximal) mixing in realistic models such as νMSSM and supersymmetric GUTs. Except in special cases, we are led to introduce a sterile neutrino so as to resolve the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles [\cite=lsnd]. A U(1) flavor symmetry, especially if it happens to be a R-symmetry, can nicely protect the sterile neutrino from becoming heavy. This symmetry, in addition, helps provide a consistent framework for understanding the charged fermion mass hierarchies, as well as the magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements. Neutrino hot dark matter can arise in models which exhibit either bi-maximal neutrino mixing or maximal νμ  -  νs and small angle νe  -  ντ MSW oscillations.
