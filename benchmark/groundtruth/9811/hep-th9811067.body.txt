Torsion and Quantized Vortices

L.C. Garcia de Andrade and C. Sivaram

ce2cm In a recent paper[\cite=1] it was shown following earlier works[\cite=2] [\cite=3] that the magnetic field associated with the torsion induced defects in spacetime with intrinsic spin density source could lead to line defects carrying a quantized flux with a relation satisfying

[formula]

Here Q is the torsion vector, (connected to the spin density σ through Q  =  (4πG / (c)2σ) α is the electromagnetic fine structure constant, [formula] is the Newtonian gravitational constant. The quantity on the r.h.s. has the dimensions of length and involves a new fundamental length different from the Planck length. This new length involves the fundamental constants e,c, and G. In this paper we extend the above approach to include also quantized vortices carrying the quantum of circulation [formula]. Earlier we had the analogy with type II superconductores, with the line defects induced by torsion carrying the flux quantum [formula].

No we will have the analogy with liquid helium II, where the superfluid has line vortices carrying the quantum of circulation [formula].

In the earlie work we had the magnetic field associated with the torsion induced line defect.

Here we would consider the torsion to be propagating and consider it as the derivative of a scalar field thus we can write[\cite=4],

[formula]

Thus [formula], where dS is the surface of integration, can be written:

[formula]

where dV is some volume element enclosed by the surface dS. Eq.([\ref=3]) follows from the Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem, and can be written :

[formula]

But from the Poisson equation :

[formula]

(as the source of φ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the density ρ in this case).

Thus

[formula]

where M is the total mass contained in the vortex. Since the source of Q is the intrinsic spin, quantized in units of [formula], it follows that GM is quantized in units of  / M(GM2  /   being dimensionless). Also [formula] must have dimensions of lenght and thus quantized as :

[formula]

Thus analogous to the chage flux quantum e, we have the mass flux [formula].

Thus torsion also induces vortices carrying the circulation quantum [formula]. This is analogous to the situation in superfluid helium, where quantized vortices carrying this mass flux quantum exist. The Helmoholtz vortex theorem :

[formula]

(V being the velocity potential ) implies the persistence of these vortices in the superfluid. We have on the one hand the analogy between torsion and the magnetic field (Q →  B,S.Q the spin torsion energy being the analogue of μ B the magnetic dipole energy[\cite=3]) and the analogy between B and the vorticity field given by W  =  curlV(i.e B  =  curlA is analogous to W  =  curlV) on the other hand. The torsion contact interaction[\cite=2] [\cite=5] can be represented by a Heisenberg type nonlinear equation[\cite=2] [\cite=6], which can be shown to reduce to a nonlinear Schr[formula]dinger equation of the type known[\cite=6] from the Landau-Ginzburg theory of superfluidity. The formal analogy between the Schr[formula]dinger equation :

[formula]

and the Navier-Stokes viscous dissipation equation :

[formula]

(where ν is the Kinematic viscosity ), implies that the quantum viscosity of these vortices is given by

[formula]

The life- time of a vortex length L is then :

[formula]

For a quantum vortex (as suggested by eq. ([\ref=6]) and ([\ref=7]) [formula], therefore giving

[formula]

(from eqs. ([\ref=11]) and [\ref=12]).

Eq.([\ref=13]) agrees with the uncrertainty principle estimate of the lifetime of an unstable state of mass M, enabling the possibility of picturing particles as quantum line vortices induced by the background torsion geometry. It is further amusing to note that if

[formula]

(as appropriated for describing collapsed gravitating configurations) then the background quantum viscosity given by eq. ([\ref=11]) would imply through eqs. ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=14]), a lifetime :

[formula]

for a collapsed object of mass M. Eq. ([\ref=15]) is precisely Hawking a formula for the quantum evaporation lifetime of black hole !

The appearence of [formula] in eq. ([\ref=15]) suggests that the decay is a quantum phenomenon, i.e.,   →   o, the lifetime is infinite. Thus quantum vortices of lenght L and mass M, if generated in a superfluid for instance, should have a lifetime of

[formula]

This could be possibly verified in laboratory expriments. Moreover if a particle or a beam of particles move around such a vortex line defect eqs.([\ref=2])-([\ref=4]), suggest that it should acquire a phase given by :

[formula]

(torsion being associated with the nonclosure of the circuit)

In the case of strings, this so called defect angle is related to the string tension μ as

[formula]

This was used in ref. 7 suggest that torsion was the basis for string tension, combining eqs.([\ref=17]) and ([\ref=18]). Further analogies will be discussed elsewhere.
