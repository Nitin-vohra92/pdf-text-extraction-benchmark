Semiinvariants of Finite Reflection Groups

Introduction

In 1989, P. Doyle and C. McMullen [\cite=McM-Doy] solved the fifth degree polynomial with a highly symmetrical dynamical system which preserved the Galois group A5. In 1997, S. Crass and P. Doyle [\cite=Cra-Doy] solved the sixth degree polynomial by again finding a dynamical system with special symmetry--this time A6 symmetry. Each dynamical system was formed by iterating a map that was equivariant under the projective action of the group. Such maps correspond naturally to semiinvariant differential forms. Because almost nothing was known about these forms, constructing the necessary dynamical systems was a difficult step in both cases.

We introduce here a general theory of semiinvariants. Specifically, we show that for any finite unitary reflection group G and multiplicative character χ of G, the module of χ-invariant differential forms has a natural multiplication which turns the module into an exterior algebra. This exterior algebra structure allows us to understand completely the forms that give rise to highly symmetrical dynamical systems, and gives us tools to compute these forms explicitly. We also show how to extend these results to vector fields (or derivations), and observe the relationship between semiinvariants and logarithmic forms.

The theory presented here builds on work by R. Stanley, who characterized the module of χ-invariant polynomials in 1977 [\cite=Stan]. It also builds on more recent work by Orlik, Saito, Solomon, Terao and others on invariant derivations and the theory of hyperplane arrangements (see [\cite=OrTer], Chapter 6). Note that det -invariant forms have received attention under the name of anti-invariant forms in the context of Coxeter groups (see e.g. [\cite=double]).

notation

Let G be a finite group of complex n  ×  n unitary matrices generated by reflections acting on [formula]. Recall that a unitary matrix is a reflection if it has finite order and fixes a hyperplane pointwise in V. Let [formula] be the ring of polynomials of V. Let [formula] be basic invariants, and [formula] be the ring of invariant polynomials. Let χ be a multiplicative character of G. Denote the module of differential p-forms on V by

[formula]

The group G acts contragradiently on V* and S, and Ωp is a [formula]-module. Define the R-module of χ-invariant differential p-forms as

[formula]

Let

[formula]

It is convenient to define Ip as the set of multiindices of {1,...,n} of length p:

[formula]

For a multiindex I, let Ic denote the complementary index. Denote the volume form on V by [formula]. If f and g are differential forms, we write [formula] if f  =  cg for some c in [formula].

We recall some facts and notation from Arrangements of Hyperplanes ([\cite=OrTer], p. 228). Let A be the hyperplane arrangement defined by G. For each H∈A, define αH∈S by ker(αH)  =  H. Fix some H∈A, and let GH be the cyclic subgroup of elements in G that fix H pointwise. Let sH be a generator of GH and let o(sH) be the order of sH. Define aH(χ) as the least integer satisfying 0  ≤  aH(χ)  <  o(sH) and χ(sH) =  det (sH)- aH(χ). Let

[formula]

The polynomial Qχ is uniquely determined, upto a nonzero scaler multiple, by the group G.

R. Stanley  [\cite=Stan] proved that [formula], and since vol is ( det - 1)-invariant, it follows that

[formula]

R. Steinberg  [\cite=Steinberg] proved that [formula] is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix [formula], upto a nonzero scalar multiple. Note also that [formula] ([\cite=OrTer], p. 229).

χ-wedging

The next lemma will be used to show that Qχ divides the exterior product of any two χ-invariant forms.

Suppose that μ is a χ-invariant p-form. Fix a hyperplane H∈A, and let a = aH(χ). Choose coordinates in which x1  =  αH and sH is diagonal. If

[formula]

in these coordinates, then xa - 11 divides μI whenever I1  =  1 and xa1 divides μI whenever I1  ≠  1, for each [formula].

Let s  =  sH and ρ be the determinant of s. Then

[formula]

and [formula], s- 1dx2  =  dx2, [formula], s- 1dxn  =  dxn.

Let I  =  {I1,I2,...,Ip}∈Ip. If I1  =  1, then

[formula]

If I1  ≠  1, then

[formula]

But μ is χ-invariant, so ρaμ  =   det (s)aμ  =  χ- 1(s)μ  =  s- 1μ. Hence if I1  =  1, then [formula], i.e. [formula]. Thus xa - 11 divides μI. Similarly, if I1  ≠  1, then [formula] and xa1 divides μI.

Qχ divides the exterior product of any two χ-invariant differential forms.

Let μ be a χ-invariant p-form and ω be a χ-invariant q-form. Fix H∈A. Let s  =  sH and a  =  aH(χ). Assume that a  ≠  0. We show that αaH divides [formula] by choosing coordinates from Lemma [\ref=lemma:degx1] in which αH  =  x1. Let

[formula]

in these coordinates. Then xa1 divides μI whenever Iq  ≠  1 and xa1 divides ωJ whenever J1  ≠  1.

Hence, for I∈Ip and J∈Iq, the polynomial μIωJ is divisible by xa1 given that not both I1 and J1 are 1. Since each γK is either zero or a sum of terms of the form ±  μIωJ where the multiindices I and J are disjoint, xa1 divides each γK and hence [formula]. Thus, [formula] is divisible by αaH  =  αaH(χ)H. Since H was arbitrary, Qχ divides [formula].

Lemma [\ref=lemma:Qdivides] prompts us to define the following multiplication in Ωχ: For differential forms μ and ω, define the χ-wedge of μ and ω as

[formula]

If μ and ω are χ-invariant forms, [formula] is again χ-invariant. Thus, Lemma [\ref=lemma:Qdivides] implies

The R-module Ωχ is closed under χ-wedging.

The following proposition gives a condition (similar to Saito's Criterion) for n 1-forms to generate Ωχ. The proof is similar to Solomon's original argument [\cite=Sol1] that [formula] generate the module of invariant differential forms.

Let [formula] be χ-invariant 1-forms. The forms [formula], for I∈Ip and p  ≥  0, generate Ωχ over R if and only if

[formula]

Assume that [formula]. The p-forms [formula] are χ-invariant by Corollary [\ref=cor:closed].

Since [formula], [formula], and the forms [formula], I∈Ip, are linearly independent over [formula]. If not, there exist rational functions rI with

[formula]

Fix J∈Ip and Jc∈In - p. Then

[formula]

and rJ must be zero. Hence the forms

[formula]

are also linearly independent over F, and thus span

[formula]

since Ωp(V) has dimension [formula].

Choose an arbitrary χ-invariant p-form μ. Then there exist rational functions tI ∈F with

[formula]

Fix J∈Ip and its complementary index Jc. We will show that tJ∈R.

By Corollary [\ref=cor:closed], the n-form [formula] is χ-invariant. Thus by Equation ([\ref=invn-forms]) above, there exists a polynomial f∈R with

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Thus [formula]. Hence, tJ∈R. Since J was arbitrary, μ is in the R-span of [formula]

The converse follows from Equation ([\ref=invn-forms]) above.

Condition satisfied

Since Ωp has rank [formula], the R-module (Ωp)χ is also free of rank [formula] (this follows from Lemma 6.45 of [\cite=OrTer], p.232). We will show that the generators of (Ω1)χ satisfy the condition given in Proposition [\ref=prop:generalSaito], but first we must gather some preliminary facts.

We recall some results about invariant vector fields. There exist n invariant vector fields, called basic derivations, that generate the module of invariant vector fields over R (see [\cite=OrTer], Section 6.3). Using Saito's Criterion, H. Terao showed that the coefficient matrix of the basic derivations has determinate Qdet - 1 upto a nonzero scaler multiple (see [\cite=OrTer], p.238). Using the minors of this coefficient matrix, we construct [formula]-invariant 1-forms, [formula], that satisfy

[formula]

The forms [formula] thus generate Ωdet - 1 over R by Proposition [\ref=prop:generalSaito]. We will use these forms to give an argument for arbitrary χ.

We also note the relationship between Qχ  ·   det and Qχ: Fix H∈A with aH(χ)  ≠  0. The exponent aH(χ  ·   det ) is the least nonnegative integer satisfying

[formula]

Hence, aH(χ  ·   det )  =  aH(χ) - 1. Now fix H∈A with aH(χ)  =  0. Then

[formula]

and aH(χ  ·   det )  =  o(sH) - 1. Thus,

[formula]

If [formula] generate (Ω1)χ over R, then

[formula]

Let M be the coefficient matrix of [formula], i.e. [formula]. Suppose that det M = 0. Then one row of M is a linear combination of the other rows over [formula]. Multiplying by a least common multiple yields a relation over S: [formula]. To get a relation over R, apply a group element g, multiply by χ- 1(g), and then sum over G:

[formula]

This contradicts the fact that (Ω1)χ is free over R with basis [formula]. Hence, det M  ≠  0.

By Corollary [\ref=cor:closed], [formula] is a χ-invariant n-form. Thus (from Equation ([\ref=invn-forms])) there exists a nonzero f∈R with

[formula]

Hence, [formula].

We show that f is constant by finding two polynomials that share no factors, yet are each divisible by f. Since each dfi is invariant, each [formula] is χ-invariant and hence a combination of [formula] over R. There exists a matrix of coefficients, N, with entries in S, such that

[formula]

But, [formula], so

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

and since det N∈S, f divides [formula].

Since each μi (introduced above) is [formula]-invariant, each [formula] is χ-invariant, and thus a R-combination of [formula]. There exists a matrix of coefficients, N', with coefficients in S, such that

[formula]

But we choose the μi so that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

and since det N'∈S, [formula] is divisible by f.

We show that the two polynomials

[formula]

have no common factors by writing them both in terms of the αH. We expand the factors:

[formula]

The first polynomial, [formula], simplifies to

[formula]

and the second polynomial, [formula], simplifies to

[formula]

Since f divides both polynomials, f must be constant. Thus, [formula] satisfy the criterion of Proposition [\ref=prop:generalSaito].

There exist n 1-forms [formula] such that Ωχ is generated over R by the forms [formula]. Thus Ωχ has the structure of an exterior algebra.

Example: G26

For an example, let us take a three dimensional complex reflection group, G26. This group is the symmetry group of a regular complex polyhedron, and is number 26 in Shephard and Todd's enumeration of finite irreducible unitary groups generated by reflections [\cite=Todd-She]. The group G26 consists of 1,296 complex 3  ×  3 matrices and is generated by reflections of order two and three. The associated collineation group (which results from moding out by the scaler matrices) is the Hessian group of order 216.

The group is generated by the matrices where α is a primitive cube root of unity.

The character table for this group reveals six multiplicative characters, each a power of the determinate character. Choose χ  =   det 3. Note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

The following 1-forms are det 3-invariant:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The polynomial Qdet 3 divides [formula], [formula], and [formula]. The determinate of the coefficient matrix of ω1, ω2, and ω3 is [formula], hence ω1, ω2, and ω3 χ-wedge to a multiple of Qχ  ·   det  =  Qdet 4. Proposition [\ref=prop:generalSaito] then implies that ω1, ω2, and ω3 generate the entire module of det 3-invariants over the ring of invariants via det 3-wedging.

Logarithmic forms

We have so far only discussed regular differential forms; we now consider rational differential forms. The S-module of logarithmic p-forms with poles along A (see also [\cite=OrTer], p. 124) is defined as

[formula]

Ziegler [\cite=Ziegler] extends this definition to multiarrangements of hyperplanes, hyperplane arrangements in which each hyperplane has a positive integer multiplicity. We apply his definitions to our context of reflection groups and semiinvariants: Let Aχ be the multiarrangement consisting of hyperplanes H∈A each with multiplicity αH(χ), i.e. the multiarrangement defined by Qχ. We define (as in [\cite=Ziegler]) the module of logarithmic p-forms of Aχ:

[formula]

Let

[formula]

[formula]

Choose ω in (Ωp)χ and fix H∈A. Using Lemma [\ref=lemma:degx1], choose coordinates in which x1  =  αH, [formula], and xaH(χ)1 divides ωI if 1∉I. Then dαH  =  dx1, and [formula], which is divisible by xaH(χ)1. Hence, [formula]. As H was arbitrary, [formula].

This relationship is stronger when χ  =   det - 1. In this case, the forms that generate Ωχ via χ-wedging over R also generate Ω(A) over S (see [\cite=Terao-Shepler] for an independent proof).

On a similar note, we have

Ω(Aχ) is closed under the exterior product.

Let ω  /  Qχ and μ  /  Qχ be in Ω(Aχ). Fix H in A and let aH(χ) = a. Choose coordinates such that x1  =  αH, and write [formula] and [formula] in these coordinates. Since [formula], ωI is divisible by xa1 as long as [formula]. Similarly, μJ is divisible by xa1 whenever [formula]. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:Qdivides], it follows that Qχ divides [formula]. Whenever [formula] and [formula], x2a1 divides ωIμJ, and thus

[formula]

is also divisible by xa1. Hence αaH divides [formula], and as H was arbitrary, [formula] is in Ω(Aχ).

Remarks

Analogous results hold for vector fields, or derivations. Let Υχ be the module of χ-invariant s in the exterior algebra of derivations. Because the group action differs here, Lemma [\ref=lemma:degx1] is slightly different, with a + 1 taking the place of a - 1 when I1 = 1. The case where I1  ≠  1 is the same as in the original lemma, and hence Qχ also divides the exterior product of two elements in Υχ (the proof is analogous to the case of Ωχ). The criterion for n derivations to generate Υχ via χ-wedging is also slightly different: they must χ-wedge to [formula] instead of [formula]. This follows from the fact that [formula] is ( det - 1)-invariant while [formula] is det -invariant. Finally, we note that the correspondence between differential p-forms (in Ωp) and (n - p)-forms in Υ (the exterior algebra of derivations) induces a module isomorphism between Ωχ and Υχ  ·   det.
