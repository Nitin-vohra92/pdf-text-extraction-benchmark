The Standard Model of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions has been dramatically successful in explaining the rates of high-energy e+e- and p reactions and the properties of the W and Z bosons. This great success, however, has focused attention on the fact the Standard Model (SM) requires a number of choices for its input parameters which are very difficult to understand. Among these are the value of the Higgs boson mass parameter μ2 and the value of the cosmological constant λ. If one assumes that the most fundamental scale in Nature is the Planck scale, [formula] GeV and writes these parameters in terms of this scale, one finds [formula], [formula].

The mystery of these small parameters has motivated many authors to consider radical ideas for the manner in which gravity is unified with the other fundamental interactions. The introduction of supersymmetry can lower the natural mass scale for μ2 and λ to 1 TeV. This ameliorates the problem of the Higgs mass but is not nearly enough of a reduction to solve the cosmological constant problem. Many authors have investigated whether a string theory of quantum gravity can provide a further reduction. String theory includes the possibility of additional microscopic space dimensions. In this context, Antoniadis [\cite=Anto] has proposed that Nature may contain additional compact dimensions of size [formula]/TeV [\cite=Lykken].

Recently, several groups [\cite=Sund] [\cite=ADD] [\cite=ST] have extended this proposal using new ideas about the strong-coupling behavior of string theory. In this regime, string theory may contain solitons or mirror surfaces that occupy lower-dimensional hypersurfaces, with some species of particle restricted to these objects. One can then imagine that the quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons of the SM live on a 4-dimensional hypersurface inside the full space-time, while gravity lives in the full, higher-dimensional space. Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) [\cite=ADD] have argued that, in these models, the fundamental gravitational scale can be as low as TeV energies, while the size of the extra dimensions can be as large as a millimeter.

If indeed gravity becomes strong at TeV energies, gravitons should be radiated at significant rates in high-energy particle collisions. In collider experiments, higher-dimensional gravitons (G) appear as massive spin-2 neutral particles which are not observed by collider detectors. As ADD pointed out, G radiation leads to missing-energy signatures in which a photon or a jet is produced with no observable particle balancing its transverse momentum. In this paper, we compute the rates of the missing-energy processes

[formula]

and the corresponding experimental constraints. We show that these experiments actually give the strongest present constraints on the size of the extra dimensions, and that future experiments will have even better sensitivity.

Conventions. In this paper, we assume that the gravitational field is the only field that propagates in the extra dimensions. It is likely that, in realistic models, the extra dimensions will also contain scalar, vector, and even fermion fields that couple to the SM particles with gravitational strength. These particles would produce additional, model-dependent, missing-energy signatures beyond those we consider here. We also assume that the typical momenta with which gravitons are emitted are small relative to the thickness of the hypersurface on which the SM particles live, and also relative to the fundamental gravitational scale. In this limit, the higher-dimensional gravitational field couples to the energy-momentum tensor of the SM, with precisely the coupling of standard 4-dimensional gravity [\cite=SundA]. To compute the rate of emission of a single G particle, we interpret the G momentum in the extra dimensions as a 4-dimensional mass for this spin-2 particle and use the Lagrangian

[formula]

Under our assumptions, this coupling is model-independent.

For definiteness, we will assume that there are n extra dimensions, and that these are compactified on an n-dimensional torus of periodicity 2πR. With our choices, the gravitational potential for r just larger than R takes the form

[formula]

Macroscopic measurements of the force of gravity constrain R to be less than a millimeter; for example, for n = 2, R  <  0.77 mm at 95% confidence [\cite=Mitro] [\cite=Price]. For r  ≪  R, the potential goes over to the r- (n + 1) dependence characteristic of the higher-dimensional space. The coefficient of this potential is proportional to a power of fundamental gravitational scale. ADD define this scale by the formula

[formula]

With this definition, M  =  1 TeV corresponds to R  =  0.68 mm for n = 2 and to R  =  3.0  ×  10- 12 cm for n = 6.

In computing the emission of G particles, it is necessary to sum over the possible values of the higher-dimensional momenta [formula]. This is, equivalently, a sum or integral over values of the 4-dimensional mass

[formula]

where Ωn is the volume of the unit sphere in n dimensions (= 2π for n = 2).

Electron-positron collisions. With these conventions, it is now straightforward to compute the rate of e+e- annihilation into an anomalous single photon recoiling against an unobserved G. This reaction could potentially be observed at the CERN e+e- collider LEP 2, or at a higher-energy e+e- collider.

The differential cross section for the reaction e-Le+R  →  γG, considered in the center of mass system for a G of mass m, is given by [\cite=helic]

[formula]

The same formula holds for e-Re+L; the helicity-violating cross sections are zero. These expressions must be integrated over the phase space ([\ref=mps]). The cross section behaves as σ  ~  sn / 2 / Mn + 2. Thus, the production of anomalous single photons increases dramatically as the center-of-mass energy is raised.

In the SM, single photon events are produced in the reaction e+e-  →  γν, which can proceed through s-channel Z0 exchange or (for the case of νe) through t-channel W exchange [\cite=Berends]. The effect of G emission would be observable as an enhancement of the cross section for single-γ production above that of this SM source. The single-γ cross section has been measured by the LEP 2 experimental groups at [formula] = 183 GeV [\cite=LEP]. The measurements agree with the SM prediction to 6% accuracy. If we integrate our prediction for the G signal over the kinematic region studied in these experiments, we find, for the case n = 2, the limits R  <  0.48 mm, M  >  1200 GeV at 95% confidence. Limits for higher values of n are given in Table [\ref=thetable].

In Figure [\ref=eefig], we show the energy distribution of single photons recoiling against G particles for the cases n = 2 and n = 6, for the parameter values at our limit, compared to the single-photon distribution from the SM process. The peak in the SM cross section results from the process in which the γ recoils against an on-shell Z0 which decays invisibly. Some additional advantage can be gained, then, in applying a cut which excludes this peak. For the kinematic region 20  <  Eγ  <  50 GeV, | cos θγ|  <  0.95 and [formula] GeV, we find the cross section for G production

[formula]

for n = 2,4,6 and M in TeV.

Higher-energy studies of e+e- annihilation will be done at a linear e+e- collider (LC). We have already noted that higher energy alone should lead to much higher sensitivity to G production. But the LC also offers another advantage, the possibility of electron beam polarization, which can be used to suppress the dominant t-channel W exchange piece of the SM background process. At [formula] TeV, with electron polarization P  =   + 0.9 (right-handed), integrating over the kinematic region 50 GeV <  Eγ  <  400 GeV, | cos θγ|  <  0.95, we find a SM background cross section of 82 fb and a G signal cross section of

[formula]

for n = 2,4,6 and M in TeV. To quantify the effect of this measurement, we assume that this cross section can be measured with 5% accuracy, and that the value to be found agrees with the SM. Then the measurement would give very strong limits on R and M which are listed in Table [\ref=thetable].

Proton-antiproton collisions. In a similar way, proton-antiproton collisions can lead to processes in which a single parton is produced at large transverse momentum recoiling against a G particle. This leads to a monojet signature of G production--a jet plus missing transverse energy (ET)--which may be visible at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The search for this reaction complements the search in e+e- reactions in the familiar way, with the higher energy available in hadron collisions compensating important losses in the definition of the signal.

The production of jets with large ET recoiling against G particles can arise from the parton subprocesses q  →  Gg, qg  →  qG, g  →  G, and gg  →  gG. The polarization- and color-averaged cross section for q  →  gG can be obtained directly from Eq. ([\ref=eeformula])

[formula]

where s,t,u are the Mandelstam variables: [formula]. The cross section for qg  →  qG can be obtained from this expression by crossing s  ↔  t:

[formula]

The cross section for g  →  G is also given by ([\ref=qgformula]). For the process gg  →  gG, we find the polarization- and color-averaged cross section [\cite=helictwo]

[formula]

All of these formulae must be integrated over the G mass spectrum using the measure ([\ref=mps]). The rate of monojet production can then be found by integrating these cross sections with appropriate parton distributions.

The processes q  →  gZ0, qg  →  qZ0, followed by an invisible decay of the Z0, give an irreducible physics background to G production. We will refer to this process as the 'SM background', and we will estimate the observability of our signal by comparing its cross section to that of this reaction. There are other important background sources from mismeasured jets and W production with forward leptons, but these backgrounds decrease sharply as the lower bound on missing ET is increased. Unlike the case of e+e- reactions, the detector does not measure the imbalance in longitudinal momentum, and there is not enough kinematic information from the single observed jet to exclude the kinematic region in which the Z0 is on-shell. On the other hand, the parton center of mass energies available at the Tevatron are higher than those of LEP 2, and we have seen that the G signal increases rapidly with energy. It is therefore reasonable to look for the monojet signal as an excess above the SM cross section for on-shell Z0 production. Though it is not so easy to compute the SM background rate accurately, this rate can be normalized to the corresponding process in which the Z0 decays to a lepton pair.

The CDF collaboration has presented a bound on monojet production based on its first 4.7 pb- 1 of data in p collisions at [formula] TeV [\cite=Markel] [\cite=later]. This analysis searched for events with missing ET greater than 30 GeV and one jet in the rapidity region |y|  <  1.2. The result was consistent with the Z0 background and can be represented as a limit on the number of neutrinos into which the Z0 decays: Nν  <  5.0 (95% confidence). We convert this to a limit on G production by comparing the cross sections for the G signal and the SM process, computed in the same framework. For simplicity, we carry out the calculations of both signal and background at the leading order in QCD, using the CTEQ4 lowest-order (set 3) structure functions [\cite=CTEQ]. We find a SM background cross section of 37 pb for the cuts listed above, and, for n = 2, a signal cross section of 20 pb/M4. This implies a limit R  <  1.2 mm, M  >  750 GeV. Limits for higher values of n are given in Table [\ref=thetable]. In Figure [\ref=ppfig], we show the missing ET spectrum of the signal and background processes.

It is advantageous to make a tighter cut on missing ET to remove the backgrounds from mismeasured jets which were a problem for the CDF analysis [\cite=Markel]. Integrating the signal and background rates over the region with missing ET  >  60 GeV and jet rapidity |y|  <  2.4, we find a SM background cross section for Z production of 10 pb, and signal cross sections in the ratios

[formula]

for n = 2,4,6 and M in TeV. Assuming that this measurement can be performed with 20% accuracy, and that the value to be found agrees with the SM, we find the potential limits on R and M listed in the third line of Table [\ref=thetable].

Hadron-hadron collisions will be studied at higher energy at the CERN LHC. At the LHC, most collisions are between gluons, since the gluon structure functions rise rapidly at low x. This suppresses the SM contribution, since gluon-gluon collisions cannot lead to Z0 production at the leader order in αs. However, we find that the most important contributions to G production also involve quarks, since the enhancement of the cross section at high energy partially compensates the falloff of the structure functions. Repeating the analysis leading to ([\ref=newTeV]) at the LHC energy of 14 TeV using the kinematic cuts ET  >  200 GeV, |y|  <  5, we find a SM background cross section of 11 pb and signal cross sections in the ratios

[formula]

for n = 2,4,6 and M in TeV. With the same assumptions as for ([\ref=newTeV]), we find the potential limits listed in the last line of Table [\ref=thetable]. It is important to note that, in the case n = 6, the dominant parton-parton center of mass energies are comparable to the quoted limit on M, so the effective coupling ([\ref=basicL]) might not be appropriate for this case.

Conclusions. In this paper, we have shown that high-energy collider searches for events with missing energy and transverse momentum provide a relevant, model-independent test of theories with large extra space dimensions. Current high-energy experiments at e+e- and p colliders already place the strongest direct constraints on these theories. Higher-energy experiments may place much stronger constraints. Or, more optimistically, they may allow us to observe an excess of missing-energy events above the SM expectation, providing direct evidence for this remarkable extension of our conception of the universe.
