Gap conjecture for 3-dimensional canonical thresholds

Introduction

Let (X∋P) be a three-dimensional canonical singularity and let S  ⊂  X be a [formula]-Cartier divisor. The canonical threshold of the pair (X,S) is

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] is rational and non-negative. Moreover, if S is effective and integral, then [formula]. Define the subset [formula] as follows

[formula]

The following conjecture is an analog of corresponding conjectures for log canonical thresholds and minimal discrepancies, see [\cite=Shokurov1988p], [\cite=Utah], [\cite=Kollar-1995-pairs], [\cite=Prokhorov-McKernan-2004], [\cite=kollar-2008].

The set [formula] satisfies the ascending chain condition.

The conjecture is interesting for applications to birational geometry, see, e.g., [\cite=Corti1995]. It was shown in [\cite=Birkar-Shokurov] that much more general form of [\ref=conj-acc] follows from ACC for minimal log discrepancies and weak Borisov-Alexeev conjecture. The important particular case of [\ref=conj-acc] is the following

[formula].

The aim of this note is to prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-gap] for n = 3 in a precise form:

[formula].

An analog of this theorem for log canonical thresholds was proved by J. Kollár [\cite=Kollar1994]: [formula].

Note that replacing (X∋P) with its terminal [formula]-factorial modification we may assume that (X∋P) is terminal. Thus the following is a stronger form of Theorem [\ref=main-1]:

Let (X∋P) be a three-dimensional terminal singularity and let S  ⊂  X be an (integral) effective Weil [formula]-Cartier divisor such that the pair (X,S) is not canonical. Then [formula]. Moreover, if (X∋P) is singular, then [formula].

The proof is rather standard. We use the classification of terminal singularities and weighted blowups techniques, cf. [\cite=Kawamata-1992-discr], [\cite=Kollar1994], [\cite=Markushevich-1996-discr].

Preliminaries

In the above notation the singularity (S∋P) is not Du Val.

This is well-known, see e.g. [\cite=Reid-1980can].

A weight [formula] is said to be admissible if [formula] contains at least one reduced non-toric component.

Gorenstein case

In this section we consider the case where (X∋P) is either smooth or an index one singularity.

If (X∋P) is smooth, then c  ≤  5 / 6.

Let c > 5 / 6. We may assume that [formula]. Let ψ(x,y,z) = 0 be an equation of S. Consider a weighted blowup [formula] with a suitable weight [formula]. Let [formula] be the exceptional divisor. Recall that (S∋P) is not Du Val. Up to analytic coordinate change there are the following cases (cf. [\cite=Kollar-Mori-19988]):

Assume that (X∋P) is a Gorenstein terminal singularity and (X∋P) is not smooth. Then c  ≤  4 / 5.

Let c > 4 / 5. We may assume that X is a hypersurface in [formula] (it is an isolated cDV-singularity [\cite=Reid-1980can]). Let φ(x,y,z,t) = 0 be the equation of X. Since (X∋P) is a cDV-singularity, [formula]. According to [\cite=Markushevich-1996-discr], in a suitable coordinate system (x,y,z,t), there is an admissible weighted blowup [formula] such that at least for one component G of [formula] we have a(G,KX) = 1. Then [formula], so [formula]. This means, in particular, that [formula]. Up to coordinate change we may assume that ψ = t. Write

[formula]

Then S is a hypersurface in [formula] given by η(x,y,z) = 0. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=l-G-1], using Morse Lemma we get the following cases:

The following examples show that bounds [formula] and ≤  4 / 5 in Theorem [\ref=main-2] are sharp.

Let [formula] and let S = Sd is given by x2 + y3 + zd, d  ≥  6. Then [formula]. We prove this by descending induction on [formula]. Take [formula] and consider the [formula]-blowup [formula]. Let [formula] be the proper transform of S. We have [formula] and [formula]. Hence, [formula]. Further,

[formula]

Thus it is sufficient to show that [formula] is canonical. We have three affine charts:

Ux: = {x  ≠  0}. Here [formula] x  ↦  x'3, y  ↦  y'x'2, z  ↦  z'x', [formula] is given in [formula] by the equation 1 + y'3 + z'dx'd - 6 = 0. Hence, in this chart, [formula] is smooth and does not pass through a (unique) singular point of [formula].

Uy: = {y  ≠  0}. Here [formula] x  ↦  x'y'3, y  ↦  y'2, z  ↦  z'y', [formula] is given in [formula] by the equation x'2 + 1 + z'dy'd - 6 = 0. Again, in this chart, [formula] is smooth and does not pass through a (unique) singular point of [formula].

Uz: = {z  ≠  0}. Here [formula] x  ↦  x'z'3, y  ↦  y'z'2, z  ↦  z', [formula] is given in [formula] by the equation x'2 + y'3 + z'd - 6 = 0. In this chart, [formula].

Thus [formula] has only terminal singularities, [formula] does not pass through any singular point of [formula], and the pair [formula] is terminal in charts Ux and Uy. In the chart Uz the pair by induction [formula] is canonical (moreover, [formula] is canonical if d  ≤  11). Therefore, [formula].

Let [formula] is given by x2 + y3 + zd + tz = 0, d  ≥  7 and let S cut out by t = 0. Take [formula] and consider the [formula]-blowup [formula]. Let [formula] be the proper transform of S. We see below that [formula] is admissible. Moreover, the exceptional divisor [formula] is reduced and irreducible. We have four charts:

Ux: = {x  ≠  0}. Here [formula], y  ↦  yx2, z  ↦  zx, t  ↦  tx5, [formula] is given in [formula] by the equation 1 + y3 + zdxd - 6 + tz = 0 and [formula] by two equations x = 1 + y3 + tz = 0. Hence, in this chart, both [formula] and [formula] are smooth.

Uy: = {y  ≠  0}. Here [formula], y  ↦  y2, z  ↦  zy, t  ↦  ty5, [formula], [formula], and [formula]. As above, both [formula] and [formula] are smooth in this chart.

Uz: = {z  ≠  0}. Here [formula], y  ↦  yz2, z  ↦  z, t  ↦  tz5, [formula], [formula], and [formula]. As above, both [formula] and [formula] are smooth in this chart.

Ut: = {t  ≠  0}. Here [formula], y  ↦  yt2, z  ↦  zt, t  ↦  t5, [formula], [formula], and [formula]. The variety [formula] has a unique singular point Q at the origin and this point is terminal of type [formula] the surface [formula] is smooth and does not pass through Q.

Thus we have a(G,KX) = 4, [formula], and [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Since the pair [formula] is canonical, [formula].

Non-Gorenstein case

Now we assume that (X∋P) is a (terminal) point of index r > 1. Let [formula] be the index-one cover and let [formula].

If (X∋P) is a cyclic quotient singularity, then [formula].

By our assumption we have [formula] for some [formula], 1  ≤  a < r, gcd (a,r) = 1. Assume that [formula]. Let ψ = 0 be a defining equation of [formula]. Consider the weighted blowup [formula] with weights [formula]. Then [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula] and so [formula]. Thus we may assume that ψ contains x3 (if [formula] we possibly have to permute coordinates). Then [formula] is smooth and [formula], i.e., S is Du Val of type Ar - 1.

If (X∋P) is a terminal singularity of index r > 1 and [formula], then KX + S  ~  0.

By Lemma [\ref=l-nG-1] (X∋P) is not a cyclic quotient singularity. There is an analytic [formula]-equivariant embedding [formula]. Let (x1,x2,x3,x4) be coordinates in [formula], let φ = 0 be an equation of [formula], and let ψ = 0 be an equation of [formula]. We can take (x1,x2,x3,x4) and φ to be semi-invariants such that one of the following holds [\cite=Reid-YPG1987]:

Main series. [formula], where gcd (a,r) = 1.

Case cAx / 4. r = 4, [formula].

In both cases [formula]. According to [\cite=Kawamata-1992-discr] there is a weight [formula] such that for the corresponding [formula]-blowup [formula] the exceptional divisor [formula] has a reduced component G of discrepancy a(G,KX) = 1 / r. Moreover, [formula], i = 1,2,3,4. Since c > 1 / 2, we have [formula], i.e., [formula], so [formula]. In particular, [formula].

Let ω be a section of [formula]. Then ω can be written as

[formula]

where λ is a semi-invariant function with

[formula]

Thus, [formula]. Hence, S  ~   - KX.

If (X∋P) is a terminal singularity of index r > 1, then c  ≤  4 / 5.

Since π is étale in codimension one, we have [formula]. Hence the pair [formula] is canonical (see, e.g., [\cite=Kollar-1995-pairs]). Assume that c > 4 / 5. By Lemma [\ref=l-nG-1] the point [formula] is singular. Then by Lemma [\ref=l-G-2] the pair [formula] is canonical. Therefore, [formula] is a Du Val singularity. Then the singularity [formula] is log terminal. On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=l-nG-2] the divisor KS is Cartier. Hence, (S∋P) is Du Val, a contradiction.
