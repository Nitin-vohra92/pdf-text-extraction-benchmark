n-LEVEL DENSITY OF THE LOW-LYING ZEROS OF QUADRATIC DIRICHLET L-FUNCTIONS

Introduction

The celebrated Riemann Hypothesis (RH) asserts that every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is of the form ρ = 1 / 2  +  iγ, with γ real. One possible approach towards establishing RH was suggested by Pólya and Hilbert long time ago, who conjectured that one should find a Hilbert space and a suitable linear operator acting on it whose spectrum is given by the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s). Then depending on the properties of the operator, the zeros are forced to lie on a line.

Montgomery [\cite=Mont] initiated the study of the local spacings of the zeros of ζ(s). Assuming RH, he derived, under certain restrictions, the pair correlation of the zeros of ζ(s) and made the famous pair correlation conjecture. His result drew the attention of Dyson, who pointed out that the eigenvalues of Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) have the same pair correlation as N  →    ∞  . With this insight, Montgomery went on to conjecture (the GUE Conjecture) that all the correlations would match up for the zeros of ζ(s) and eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices. Montgomery's pair correlation result then provides the first evidence in favor of the spectral interpretation of the zeros, suggesting that the relevant operator might be Hermitian.

Rudnick and Sarnak [\cite=R&S] studied the distribution of zeros of general L-functions. According to the Langlands program (see [\cite=Ge] , [\cite=Murty], [\cite=knapp]), all L-functions can be written as products of "standard" L-functions L(s,π) attached to automorphic cuspidal representations of GLM over [formula]. The Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for L(s,π) asserts that the non-trivial zeros of L(s,π) all lie on the line [formula] when properly normalized. The result of Rudnick and Sarnak [\cite=R&S] asserts that the n  ≥  2 correlations of the zeros of L(s,π) (assuming GRH and with some restrictions) are universally the GUE ones. Their result is confirmed by the numerical work of Rumely [\cite=Rum] for Dirichlet L-functions and of Rubinstein [\cite=Ru] for a variety of [formula] L-functions.

On the random matrix theory side, Katz and Sarnak showed [\cite=K&S1] that the local spacing statistics for the following types of spaces are universally GUE: (special) orthogonal [formula], (special) unitary SU(N) and (unitary) symplectic USp(2N) groups. In contrast to this, they also showed that the distributions of the eigenvalues nearest to 1 is sensitive to the particular symmetry of the group. Based on this and studies on the function field analogues, Katz and Sarnak conjecture (the Density Conjecture, [\cite=K&S]) that to each reasonable family F of L-functions (by which we mean a collection of geometric objects and their associated L-functions, where the geometric objects have similar properties), one can associate a classical compact group G(F) mentioned above, such that the behavior of zeros near the central point s  =  1 / 2 (the low-lying zeros) of L-functions in F is the same as the behavior of eigenvalues near 1 of matrices in G(F). This conjecture further suggests that in terms of the spectral interpretation, the relevant operators for L-functions should have some symmetry corresponding to the relevant classical group.

The 1-level density for quadratic twists of ζ(s) was obtained by Özlük and Snyder [\cite=O&S]. A stronger result which applies for ζ(s) as well as all L(s,π) was obtained by N. Katz and Sarnak [\cite=K&S]. The general case n  ≥  1 was obtained by Rubinstein [\cite=R]. Results are also obtained for a wide variety of families of L-functions, see [\cite=K&S1], [\cite=ILS], [\cite=Miller], [\cite=Gu], [\cite=D&M] and [\cite=H&M]. In all the results above, the Fourier transforms for test functions are assumed to be compactly supported in certain regions. In this paper, we will study the n-level density of the low-lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions. This family of L-functions was studied by Rubinstein in [\cite=R]. Our result in this paper extends the one of Rubinstein's by enlarging the region in which the Fourier transform for the test function is supported. In the next section, we shall give a detailed description of the problem studied in this paper and give an explanation on the method being used in the proof of the main result. Section [\ref=sec3.0] will be devoted entirely for the proof of our main result of the paper.

Statement of the Result and Outline of the proof

In this paper, we consider the average behavior of the low-lying non-trivial zeros of a family of L-functions hoping to find evidence in favor of the Density Conjecture. We focus on the quadratic twists of ζ(s), {L(s,χd)} as our family of L-functions, where [formula] is the Jacobi symbol. We recall here all real (quadratic) non-principal characters are of the form χd(n), where d belongs to the set Q of quadratic discriminants, Q  =  {d:d is not a square and [formula]. The character χd(n) is induced by a primitive character χd'(n) where d' belongs to the set F of fundamental discriminants, [formula] square-free } [formula] [formula] square-free } (see [\cite=D]).

To facilitate our study, it is more convenient to consider the family of {L(s,χ8d)} with odd, positive square-free d. We may thus avoid the possible impact of χ2 in our study and it follows from the discussions in the proceeding paragraph that χ8d is a real, primitive character with conductor 8d and χ8d( - 1) = 1. Let D denote the set of such d's, and let D(X) = {d∈D:X  ≤  d  ≤  2X}. It's easy to see that the cardinality |D(X)| of D(X) is asymptotically 4X / π2. In this case, the Density Conjecture suggests a unitary symplectic symmetry and our main result below (Theorem [\ref=thm2.1] ) or its corollary provides an evidence for it.

Let h be a function on [formula], we say that h tends to 0 rapidly at infinity (or rapidly decreasing) if for each positive integer m, the function x  ↦  (1 + |x|)mh(x) is bounded for |x| sufficiently large. We define the Schwartz space [formula] to be the set of functions on [formula] which are infinitely differentiable, and which tend to 0 rapidly at infinity, as well as their derivatives of all orders (see [\cite=L]).

Now for each fi even and in [formula], we write

[formula]

Throughout the paper, we assume GRH and write the non-trivial zeros of L(s,χ8d) as where and

[formula]

Let N(T,8d) denote the number of γ(j)8d's with |γ(j)8d| < T, then we have (see [\cite=D]) for T  ≥  2 We note here the above formula doesn't provide us much information when T is close to 1, since then the main term and the error term are of the same size. However, by taking T = 1 in N(T,8d) one may think that there are about log (8d) / π many zeros up to height 1 so that the mean spacing between them is 2π  /   log (8d), which is also likely to be the height of the lowest zero. Thus by scaling back this height to 1, and note that d is of size X, we are then interested in studying the asymptotic behavior of with L =  log X / (2π) and [formula] is over [formula] with jk1  ≠    ±  jk2 if k1  ≠  k2. Note that since f is rapidly decreasing, only the low-lying zeros contribute to the sums above. The Density Conjecture predicts that

[formula]

where and

Rubinstein [\cite=R] has shown that [\eqref=01.01] holds for [formula] being supported in the region [formula]. Presumably, [\eqref=01.01] also holds for f being compactly supported (by the Density Conjecture). However, since f and [formula] can't both be compactly supported, we can't approximate a compactly supported function by functions with compactly supported Fourier transforms. Thus one needs to prove [\eqref=01.01] for the support of [formula] being as large as possible. The main result in this paper is an evaluation of the left-hand side of [\eqref=01.01] for [formula] supported in [formula], which is given in the following:

Assume GRH and assume in [\eqref=01.01] that each fi is even and in [formula] and [formula] is supported in [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula] ranges over all ways of decomposing [formula] into disjoint subsets [formula] Fν()} with

[formula]

S ranges over all 2ν() subsets of [formula] and Sc denotes the complement of S. Here [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of S2 and [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of S3. Empty products are taken to be 1.

Unfortunately, we are not able to show the above result matches with the right-hand side of [\eqref=01.01] in general. In the case of n  ≤  3, one can show by direct computation that our result above does match with the right-hand side of [\eqref=01.01]. As the proof is not particularly enlightening, we shall omit it here by stating the following result and refer the interested reader to [\cite=Gao] for the proof:

Assume GRH. For n  ≤  3, equality holds in [\eqref=01.01] if each fi is even and in [formula] and [formula] is supported in [formula].

We note here one can also check that Theorem [\ref=thm2.1] implies Rubinstein's result.

Outline of the Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2.1]

Our approach of proving Theorem [\ref=thm2.1] relies on the following explicit formula, which essentially converts the sum over zeros of the L-function to the sum over primes, the one we use here follows from [\cite=R&S]:

Let h be a function on [formula] with [formula] smooth and compactly supported. Then

[formula]

with the implicit constant depending on h and

Note that fi( - x) = fi(x) implies that

[formula]

where The sum in [\eqref=8.1] is over distinct indices [formula]. In order to apply Lemma [\ref=lem2.2.1] to [\eqref=8.1], we would prefer to have a sum over all indices. To remove the distinctive condition, we use a combinatorial sieving as in [\cite=R&S]. We begin with some set-theoretic combinatorics. A set partition [formula] of [formula] is a decomposition of [formula] into disjoint subsets [formula]. The collection Πn of all set partitions of [formula] forms a lattice with the partial ordering given by [formula] if every subset Gi of [formula] is a union of subsets of [formula]. The minimal element of Πn is [formula] and the maximal element is [formula].

The Möbius function of a poset such as Πn is the unique function μ(x,y) so that for any functions [formula], satisfying we have In the case of Πn, the Möbius function can be computed explicitly [\cite=L&W], in particular

Given a set partition [formula], we have an embedding [formula], [formula] with yi = xj if i∈j. For example, for n = 3, the possible [formula]'s are {{1,2,3}}, {{1,2},{3}}, {{1,3},{2}}, {{1},{2,3}}, {{1},{2},{3}} and l{{1},{2,3}}(x1,x2) = (x1,x2,x2).

We now define

[formula]

Note that the inner sum on the right-hand side of [\eqref=8.1] is just [formula] and observe that for any ∈Πn, This is merely partitioning the unrestricted sum for [formula] as a sum over the various possibilities for coincidences between the indices. Thus we can use Möbius inversion to express [formula] in terms of the sums [formula]: so that the right-hand side of [\eqref=8.1] can be expressed as where [formula] ranges over all ways of decomposing [formula] into disjoint subsets {F1, [formula]. By [\eqref=01.00] and because we are assuming that the fi's are even, we can recast the inner sum above as going over all the γ(j)8d's ( instead of j > 0) with the presence of a factor 1 / 2ν(). Thus, [\eqref=8.1] becomes

[formula]

We write so that we can express [\eqref=8.1'] as

By the explicit formula [\eqref=01.3], we now arrive at the following (note that [formula] is supported in [formula], see Lemma [\ref=lem10.1] below):

Assume each fi in [\eqref=01.01] is even and in [formula] and [formula] is supported in [formula], then

[formula]

where (note that l(x) is even since each fi is even),

[formula]

For the moment, we consider the expression in [\eqref=8.3] without the term [formula]. When we expand the product over l, we obtain 2ν() terms, each a product of Cl's and Dl's. A typical term can be written as for some subset S of [formula]. (Empty products are taken to be 1.) The product of the Cl's contributes a factor of

In order to evaluate the contribution of the product of the Dl's, we first focus on finding the asymptotic expression of (with n  ≥  1) where ĝi(ui)'s are smooth and supported on [formula] with ε to be specified later. To emphasis this condition, here and throughout we shall set Y = X2 - ε and write the condition [formula] explicitly. In place of [formula] it is technically easier to consider the smoothed sum where Φ is a smooth function supported on (1,2), satisfying Φ(t) = 1 for t∈(1 + 1 / U,2 - 1 / U), and such that Φ(j)(t)  ≪  jUj for all integers j  ≥  0.

Let Z > 1 be a real parameter to be chosen later and write μ2(d) = MZ(d) + RZ(d) where

Define

[formula]

so that [formula].

Using standard techniques, we can show that by choosing U and Z properly, both the terms [formula] and |S(X,Y; [formula] -   [formula] are small. Hence the main term arises only from [formula]. We write it as

[formula]

From the above one can see that the problem of obtaining an asymptotic expression of the term [formula] is reduced to an evaluation of certain character sums, specifically,

To help understanding the situation, we consider a simple case, Z = 1 here and we also replace [formula] with P in the above sum, with no constraint on the value of P. Hence we are lead to consider the smoothed character sum

[formula]

We certainly expect the above sum is large when [formula], in which case the character [formula] is principal.

When [formula], we note that the length of our character sum is of size X and when P  ≤  X, we are dealing with a long character sum and therefore we expect substantial cancellations. This is exactly what was carried out in Rubinstein's work [\cite=R].

When [formula] and X  <  P, we are dealing with a short character sum. Our idea then is to apply the Poisson summation formula (see Lemma [\ref=lem2] below) to convert [\eqref=2.22] to another sum: with the definition of Gm and [formula] given in Lemma [\ref=lem1] and [\eqref=012], respectively. Here (x) can be thought as being supported in |x| < 1 and Gm(P) can be treated as a character. Hence we have converted [\eqref=2.22] to another character sum with length of size P / X and we expect to obtain a better estimation this way as long as P / X  <  X or P  <  X2, which is exactly why we can have [formula] in Theorem [\ref=thm2.1].

The Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2.1]

The Term SR

We recall here in Chapter [\ref=sec2.1] we have defined We will show in this section that this is negligible. As a preparation, we first seek a bound for for any non-principal quadratic character χ with modulus q and U  ≤  X2. We have the following

Assume GRH. For any non-principal quadratic character χ with modulus q and U  ≤  X2 and with [formula] smooth and supported in [formula],

Both the estimation and the method we use for the proof are standard and we include a proof here for completeness. We first assume 2  ≤  U  ≤  X2 and note the following discontinuous integral [\cite=D]: where c > 0 and that [\cite=D] for y > 0,c > 0,T > 0,

Using the above, we can recast [formula] as

[formula]

For the first error term above, we may assume U is an integer and we use [formula] for an arbitrarily small number δ so that the each single product is of size ≪  U- 1 / 2 + δ and there are at most (ω(U))n choices for selecting the pi's. Here ω(m) denotes the number of distinct primes dividing m and it's well-known that for m  ≥  3, It follows from this that the error term is of size

Note that [formula] is bounded below for [formula] or [formula] and those [formula] in this range contribute to the second error term above

For the terms [formula], we note that Hence these terms contribute

Similarly, the terms [formula] contribute

It remains to treat the integral on the right-hand side of [\eqref=3.01]. We first look at the case when χ is primitive. Note for any fixed |t|  ≤  T, V  ≥  2, Now write for c1 = 1 + 1 /  log V,

[formula]

Similar as in [\cite=D] and assume GRH, we have for T1 > |t| + 2,

[formula]

where ρ = 1 / 2 + iγ denotes a non-trivial zero of the L-function. Let N(T,χ) denote the number of zeros of L(s,χ) in the rectangle 0 < σ < 1,|t| < T. By [\cite=D], N(T + 1,χ) - N(T,χ)  ≪   log (qT) so that

For our application here, we will take V  ≤  T = X2. Hence upon taking T1 = X4, we obtain The above holds also for 1  ≤  V  <  2, hence by partial summation, for χ primitive, c = 1 /  log X,|t|  ≤  T,1  ≤  i  ≤  n,

[formula]

Now for χ induced by χ1 with modulus q1|q, we have

[formula]

Hence [\eqref=3.02] still holds in this case and on setting c = 1 /  log X,T = X2, we obtain for 2  ≤  U  ≤  X2, Note that [formula] when 1  ≤  U < 2 and this completes the proof.

As a consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop3.1], we have

With the definition at the beginning of this section,

On writing d = l2m, we obtain

[formula]

The Term SM

As explained in Section [\ref=sec_2.3], we will evaluate [formula] by applying the Poisson summation formula to the sum over d in [formula]. For all odd integers k and all integers m, we introduce the Gauss-type sums where e(x): = e2πix as defined before. We quote Lemma 2.3 of [\cite=sound1] which determines Gm(k).

If (k1,k2) = 1 then Gm(k1k2) = Gm(k1)Gm(k2). Suppose that pa is the largest power of p dividing m (put a =   ∞   if m = 0). Then for b  ≥  1 we have

For [formula] we define

[formula]

We quote Lemma 2.6 of [\cite=sound1] which determines the inner sum in [\eqref=3.1].

Let Φ be a non-negative, smooth function supported in (1,2). For any odd integer k,

Now we can write [formula] as

[formula]

The First Main Term

We consider the sum S0 in [formula] corresponding to the contribution of m = 0. It follows directly from the definition that G0(k) = φ(k) if [formula] and G0(k) = 0 otherwise. Thus S0 = 0 when n is odd and for the even n's, For a partition of the set [formula] into k subsets {Ii} with |Ii| = αi, we denote

[formula]

Using the above notation, we can express S0 as linear combinations of the sums of the following form

[formula]

where we have used If αi  ≥  4 for some i then the right-hand side expression in [\eqref=3.002] is readily seen to be Since there are On(1) partitions of the set [formula], we can now write S0 as where [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of [formula]. By using similar arguments as above, we see that removing the condition pi  ≠  pj introduces an error term of size ≪  X log n - 1X, hence

[formula]

where the integral on the right-hand side of [\eqref=4.1] comes from partial summation and Mertens' formula [\cite=D] .

The Error Term

We now consider the sums in [formula] corresponding to the contribution of [formula]. Using the notations in Section [\ref=sec_3.3], the sums in [formula] corresponding to the contribution of [formula] are linear combinations of the sums of the following form

[formula]

There are On(1) partitions of the set [formula] and we now consider the above sum for a fixed partition. Without loss of generality, we may assume there exists integers k1,k2 with 0  ≤  k2  ≤  k1  ≤  k such that for k2  <  i  ≤  k, [formula] and αi [formula] for i  ≤  k2; for k1  <  i  ≤  k, αi  =  1 and for k2  <  i  ≤  k1, αi  ≥  3. By Lemma [\ref=lem1], each m can be written as [formula] and we take empty product to be 1. Hence with a slightly change of notation, the sum we are interested in can be written as

[formula]

For any non-principal quadratic character χ with modulus q and for [formula] smooth with support in [formula], we write for U  ≤  X2, and similar to our treatment of [formula] in Section [\ref=sec_3.1], one has

[formula]

Note that so that we can express the condition [formula] by using the the character [formula]. As [formula] is a non-principal quadratic character and note that [formula] is supported in [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=lem10.1] below), we obtain by using [\eqref=3.04] and partial summation, that

[formula]

Hence we have where

[formula]

Now we need a lemma

For N > 0,M  ≥  2,

[formula]

Observe for |ξ|  <  1, and similarly for any i  ≥  0,

[formula]

Also note via integration by parts, Similarly, one can show for any i  ≥  0,j  ≥  1,

[formula]

Now using [\eqref=16'] with i = 0 and [\eqref=18] with i = 0,j = 2 we obtain

[formula]

and this proves [\eqref=3.05]. Similarly, using [\eqref=16'] with i = 0 and [\eqref=18] with i = 1,j = 3 we obtain

[formula]

which yields the estimation in [\eqref=3.06].

By Lemma [\ref=lem1] again, we can further divide the set [formula] into the union of two subsets I,J such that each m can be written as [formula]. There are On(1) such partitions and without loss of generality, we now consider the case [formula], for some integer 0  ≤  k3  ≤  k2 with [formula] and here we take empty product to be 1. We now bound Gm(pαii)  ≪  pαii for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k3 and Gm(pαii)  ≪  pαi - 1i for k3 + 1  ≤  i  ≤  k2 by Lemma [\ref=lem1] and apply [\eqref=3.05] with [formula] and [formula] to bound the sum over those m's in R1 as

Further note that αi  ≥  2 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k1, hence we deduce that

Similarly, by using the bound Gm(pαii)  ≪  pαii for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k3 and Gm(pαii)  ≪  pαi - 1i for k3 + 1  ≤  i  ≤  k2 and apply [\eqref=3.05] with [formula] and [formula], we can bound the sum over those m's in R2 as From this and that αi  ≥  3 for k2 + 1  ≤  i  ≤  k1, we deduce that

Lastly, we bound the sum over those m's in R3 by applying [\eqref=3.06] with [formula] and [formula] to be which yields

Combining the estimations above, we obtain

The Second Main Term

Using the notations in Section [\ref=sec_3.3], the sums corresponding to the contribution of [formula] in [formula] are linear combinations of the sums of the following form:

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we focus first on the case where there exists an integer k1 with 0  ≤  k1  ≤  k such that for k1  <  i  ≤  k, [formula] and [formula] for i  ≤  k1. By Lemma [\ref=lem1], each m2 can be written as [formula] and we take empty product to be 1. Thus the sum we are interested now becomes, by a slightly change of notation,

[formula]

where we have expressed the condition [formula] as [formula]. To treat the sum over m above, we need the following lemma:

For y > 0,

For y > 0, we write

Define then by Poisson summation,

[formula]

The last step above follows from [\eqref=16'] and [\eqref=18] with i = 1,2,j = 2 and this completes the proof.

We now divide the set [formula] into the union of two subsets I,J and set [formula]. Here we take empty product to be 1. When [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence these terms contribute to the right-hand side of [\eqref=6.1] of order

When [formula], by our discussion above,

[formula]

The error term above contribute to the right-hand side of [\eqref=6.1] of order

It's also easy to see that if αi  >  2 for i  ≤  k1 or αi > 1 for k1  <  i  ≤  k then the first term on the right-hand side of [\eqref=6.3] will contribute to the right-hand side of [\eqref=6.1] of order

Thus the main contribution to the right-hand side of [\eqref=6.1] comes from the case αi  =  2,i  ≤  k1, αi = 1,k1  <  i  ≤  k, which corresponds to a partition of [formula] into two subsets S,Sc with Sc nonempty, |S| even and a way of pairing up the elements of S. Hence by partial summation, we can write the sums in [formula] corresponding to the contribution of [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of S and we note here removing the condition pi  ≠  pj on the right-hand side of [\eqref=6.1] only introduces an error term of O(X log n - 1X).

The Asymptotic Expression

Putting together what we obtain and note that (0) = 1 + O(1 / U), we get

[formula]

where [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of [formula] and [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of S.

We now apply similar argument to the new choice Φ1(t) = 1 - Φ(t) for 1  ≤  t  ≤  2 and Φ1(t) = 0 otherwise and by taking [formula] to obtain

[formula]

From the above we deduce easily that

[formula]

Conclusion

We continue the discussion from Section [\ref=sec_2.3] here. To consider the contribution of the product of the Dl's, we need the following lemma [\cite=R] :

Suppose [formula] is supported in [formula]. Then [formula] is supported in [formula].

Now by the above lemma and [\eqref=9.1], the product of the Dl's considered in the paragraph below Proposition [\ref=prop2.5] contributes a factor of

[formula]

Here [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of S2 and [formula] is over all ways of pairing up the elements of S3. From this we find that [\eqref=8.1] tends, as X  →    ∞  , to the right-hand side of [\eqref=10.06].

To conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2.1], it is left to show that dropping the term O( log  log X  /   log X) won't affect our discussion above, and this is given by the following lemma [\cite=R] :

Let [formula], with [formula], then
