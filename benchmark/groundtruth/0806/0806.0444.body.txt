Abstract

We solve the Cauchy problem of the Ward equation with both continuous and discrete scattering data.

Introduction

The Ward equation (or the modified 2 + 1 chiral model)

[formula]

for [formula], ∂w  =  ∂  /  ∂w, is obtained from a dimension reduction and a gauge fixing of the self-dual Yang-Mills equation on [formula] [\cite=DTU], [\cite=T06]. It is an integrable system which possesses the Lax pair [\cite=W88]

[formula]

with [formula], [formula]. Note ([\ref=E:Lax3]) implies that J- 1∂ξJ =  - ∂xQ, J- 1∂xJ =  - ∂ηQ. Then by a change of variables (η,x,ξ)  →  (x,y,t), ([\ref=E:Lax3]) is equivalent to

[formula]

[\cite=FI01], and the Ward equation ([\ref=E:Ward]) turns into:

[formula]

The construction of solitons, and the study of the scattering properties of solitons of the Ward equation have been studied intensively by solving the degenerated Riemann-Hilbert problem and studying the limiting method [\cite=W88], [\cite=W95], [\cite=I96], [\cite=An97], [\cite=An98], [\cite=IZ98]. In particular, Dai and Terng gave an explicit construction of all solitons of the Ward equation by establishing a theory of Backlund transformation [\cite=DT07].

On the other hand, Villarroel [\cite=V90], Fokas and Ioannidou [\cite=FI01], Dai, Terng and Uhlenbeck [\cite=DTU] investigate the scattering and inverse scattering problem and solve the Cauchy problem of the Ward equation if the initial potential is sufficiently small. Under the small data condition, the eigenfunctions Ψ possesses continuous scattering data only and therefore the solutions for the Ward equation do not include the solitons in previous study.

Observing the similarity between Lax pairs of the Ward equation and the AKNS system [\cite=BC84], [\cite=BC85] and transforming the spectral equation ([\ref=E:Lax01]) into a [formula]-equation, the author uses the Beals-Coifman scheme, the L2-theory of the Cauchy integral operator and estimation of the singular integral to solve the scattering and inverse scattering problem and the Cauchy problem of the Ward equation if the initial potential possesses purely continuous scattering data [\cite=Wu].

The purpose of the present paper is to apply the above existence theory and the Backlund transformation theory to solve the the Cauchy problem of the Ward equation with mixed scattering data. The scheme we will follow was developed by [\cite=TU00], [\cite=DTU] to construct AKNS flows and Ward equations. More precisely, we will generalize the results of [\cite=V90], [\cite=FI01], [\cite=DTU], [\cite=Wu] by the following theorem:

If [formula], k  ≥  7 (see Definition [\ref=D:L11]), and the poles of Ψ0 (including the multiplicity) are finite and contained in [formula], then the Cauchy problem of the Ward equation ([\ref=E:chiral]) with initial condition Q(x,y,0) = Q0(x,y) admits a smooth global solution satisfying: for i + j + h  ≤  k - 4, i2 + j2 > 0,

[formula]

The Cauchy problem with purely continuous scattering data

We summarize the results of [\cite=Wu] which are necessary in proving Theorem [\ref=T:cauchy2]. First of all, define the functional spaces

[formula]

Let [formula], k  ≥  2. Then there is a bounded set [formula] such that

[formula] is discrete in [formula];

For [formula], the problem ([\ref=E:Lax01]) has a unique solution Ψ and [formula];

For [formula], the eigenfunction Ψ(x,y,  ·  ) is meromorphic in [formula] with poles precisely at the points of Z;

Ψ(x,y,λ) satisfies:

[formula]

Ψ(x,0,λ) satisfies:

[formula]

Where ε > 0 is any given constant, Dε(λj) is the disk of radius ε centered at λj. Finally, for λ∉Z,

[formula]

See Theorem 1.1, Corollary 4.1 and Lemma 4.14 in [\cite=Wu].

For [formula], k  ≥  7, if Ψ± exist, then there exists uniquely a function v(x,y,λ) such that

[formula]

Moreover, v satisfies the algebraic constraints:

[formula]

and the analytic constraints: for i + j  ≤  k - 4,

[formula]

Where Lλ  =  ∂y  -  λ∂x.

Note it is of no harm to replace the condition Z = Z(Ψ) = φ by the existence of Ψ± in the proof of Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=Wu].

Suppose v(x,y,λ) satisfies ([\ref=E:real1']), ([\ref=E:real2']), and ([\ref=E:0anal2'])-([\ref=E:0anal3']), k  ≥  7. Then there exists a unique solution Ψ(x,y,  ·  ) for the Riemann-Hilbert problem [formula] such that

[formula]

In addition, for each fixed [formula], and i + j  ≤  k - 4, Moreover,

[formula]

See Theorem 1.3 and Lemma 6.6 in [\cite=Wu]. Note ([\ref=E:0ana15']) is not used in the proof of Theorem 1.3 in [\cite=Wu]. It is only used in justifying the existence of Q(x,y) (see the proof of Theorem 1.4 in [\cite=Wu]).

If [formula], k  ≥  7, and there are no poles of the eigenfunction Ψ0 of Q0, then the Cauchy problem of the Ward equation ([\ref=E:chiral]) with initial condition Q(x,y,0) = Q0(x,y) admits a smooth global solution satisfying: for i + j + h  ≤  k - 4, i2 + j2 > 0,

[formula]

The Cauchy problem with purely discrete scattering data

We review results of [\cite=DT07] which are necessary for the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:cauchy2].

[formula]

For ψ∈Dr and [formula], we can factorize ψ as a product of [formula]. Where fi∈Dr, [formula] and zi  ≠  zj if i  ≠  j.

See Theorem 5.4 in [\cite=U89] and Corollary 4.5 in [\cite=DT07].

Let A0(x,y), A(x,y,t), and [formula].

η0(x,y) is called a fundamental solution of the system

[formula]

if for [formula] satisfies ([\ref=E:fundsimple]), there exists H(x + zy) such that

[formula]

η(x,y,t) is called a fundamental solution of

[formula]

if for [formula] satisfies ([\ref=E:fund1]), ([\ref=E:fund2]), there exists H(x + zy + z2t) such that

[formula]

The next goal is to solve the following Cauchy problem ([\ref=E:Laxini])-([\ref=E:bdc1]).

Suppose there exist A0(x,y), Ψ0(x,y,λ) such that

[formula]

and Where C1 is independent of x, y. Then there exist Ψ(x,y,t,λ), A(x,y,t), B(x,y,t) such that

[formula]

and

This theorem is indeed a rephrase of a very decent result (Theorem 8.6) in [\cite=DT07]. For convenience, the proof is sketched here. The theorem will be proved by simultaneously establishing ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:bdc1]), and the following statements ([\ref=E:fund3])-([\ref=E:fund6]):

[formula]

Where C2 is independent of x, y.

Suppose k = 1. By the results of [\cite=U89], [\cite=W88], [\cite=W89], one has

[formula]

Where [formula], π*0  =  π0, π20  =  π0, [formula] is spanned by columns of

[formula]

and Mn  ×  r denotes the space of rank r complex n  ×  r matrices. Note by ([\ref=E:diff]), one can find another ṽ(x + zy), [formula] is holomorphic in the neighborhood of p1, [formula], ps, and [formula] is spanned by columns of ṽ. Hence ([\ref=E:p0])-([\ref=E:V]) hold for [formula].

Now let us define

[formula]

then ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:bdc1]) are satisfied with

[formula]

To prove ([\ref=E:fund3])-([\ref=E:fund6]), by a Dai and Terng's construction (Theorem 8.6 in [\cite=DT07]), one can find a fundamental solution η(x,y,t) of ([\ref=E:fund1]) and ([\ref=E:fund2]) by defining Defining η0(x,y) by ([\ref=E:fund5]) and using ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:initial]), ([\ref=E:diff1]), ([\ref=E:bdc1]), the invertibility of η, one has ([\ref=E:fund3]), ([\ref=E:diff2]), and ([\ref=E:fund6]).

Now suppose ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:fund6]) hold for k and assume that Z(Ψ0) = {z} with multiplicity k + 1. Using the minimal factorization property of elements in Dr (see Section 4 and Theorem 8.1 in [\cite=DT07]), one would obtain

[formula]

and Where C3, C4 are independent of x, y. Conditions ([\ref=E:F1])-([\ref=E:fund6']), ([\ref=E:Laxini]), and Proposition 7.1, 7.4 in [\cite=DT07] conclude that there exist Where cj are independent of x, y. Besides, by ([\ref=E:F3])-([\ref=E:fund6']), and the induction hypothesis, there exists a fundamental solution ηk,0(x,y) of ([\ref=E:tildeA]). Hence there are H1, [formula], Hnk + 1:C  →  Mn  ×  1 such that Where cj' are independent of x, y. Moreover, by induction, one can find Ψk(x,y,t,λ) solution of ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:bdc1]), ηk a solution of ([\ref=E:fund4])-([\ref=E:fund6]) with Ψ0, A0, A, B, η0, η replaced by Ψk,0, Ak,0, Ak, Bk, ηk,0, ηk. So by ([\ref=E:exp]), ([\ref=E:tau]), and ([\ref=E:F1]), one can extend τj,0(x,y), πk + 1,0, Ψ by

[formula]

Therefore, we can apply Lemma 8.2, and Proposition 7.1 in [\cite=DT07] to prove ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:bdc1]) for the case of k + 1.

To prove ([\ref=E:fund3])-([\ref=E:fund6]) for the case of k + 1, by a Dai and Terng's construction, one can find a fundamental solution η(x,y,t) of ([\ref=E:fund1]) and ([\ref=E:fund2]) by defining Defining η0(x,y) by ([\ref=E:fund5]) and using ([\ref=E:Lax03])-([\ref=E:initial]), ([\ref=E:diff1]), ([\ref=E:bdc1]), the invertibility of η, one has ([\ref=E:fund3]), ([\ref=E:diff2]), and ([\ref=E:fund6]).

Suppose both f(x,y,t,λ) and g(x,y,t,λ) satisfy ([\ref=E:Lax03]), ([\ref=E:Lax04]) with different A, B. If [formula] with multiplicity of k, and f is holomorphic and non-degenerate at z, [formula]. Then there exist unique [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula] with multiplicity of k, [formula] is holomorphic and non-degenerate at z, [formula].

Ψ  =  g = f satisfies ([\ref=E:Lax03]), ([\ref=E:Lax04]) with new A, B.

Moreover, if for i + j + h  ≤  N, and [formula] fixed, then for i + j + h  ≤  N, and [formula] fixed, Where C1, C2, C3 are independent of x, y, t.

See Theorem 6.1 in [\cite=DT07]. Note the regularity property ([\ref=E:diff4]) and the asymptotic property ([\ref=E:boundary]) are proved by using the property "' each component of the minimal factorization of g satisfies ([\ref=E:diff3]), and ([\ref=E:bdc3'])"'.

The same argument yields

Suppose both f(x,y,λ) and g(x,y,λ) satisfy ([\ref=E:Laxini]) with different A0. If [formula] with multiplicity of k, and g is holomorphic and non-degenerate at z, [formula]. Then there exist unique [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula] with multiplicity of k, [formula] is holomorphic and non-degenerate at z, [formula].

Ψ  =  g = f satisfies ([\ref=E:Laxini]) with a new A0.

The Cauchy problem: Mixed scattering data

For [formula], k  ≥  7, if Z = Z(Ψ) is finite and [formula], then there exist uniquely f, ∈Dc, g, ∈Dr, such that

[formula]

Moreover, for i + j  ≤  k - 4, and [formula] fixed,

Since Z is finite. Theorem [\ref=T:LNexistence] implies the existence of Ψ±. Hence Theorem [\ref=T:CSDsum] implies that: [formula], [formula] such that By Theorem [\ref=T:invexistence], we can find a function f(x,y,λ), such that f satisfies ([\ref=E:diff5])-([\ref=E:determinant]), f(x,y,  ·  )∈Dc, and

[formula]

Hence if we define   =  Ψf- 1, then Theorem [\ref=T:LNexistence], f(x,y,  ·  )∈Dc, ([\ref=E:dual]), ([\ref=E:riemann]) and Z is finite imply

[formula]

Hence we prove the existence of f and [formula].

Besides, using a similar argument as that in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:CSDsum], there exists ṽc(x,y,λ), [formula] such that By a similar argument as that in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:invexistence], there exists a function (x,y,λ), such that [formula] satisfies ([\ref=E:diff5]), ([\ref=E:boundary5]), (x,y,  ·  )∈Dc, and

[formula]

Hence if we define g = - 1Ψ, then Theorem [\ref=T:LNexistence], (x,y,  ·  )∈Dc, ([\ref=E:tildedual]), ([\ref=E:tilderiemann]) and Z is finite imply g(x,y,  ·  )∈Dr and g satisfies ([\ref=E:diff5])-([\ref=E:determinant]).

Suppose Ψ  =  1f1  =  f where f1, 1 satisfy the statement of the theorem. Hence - 11 = ff- 11. The right hand side is holomorphic in [formula], the left hand side is continuous across the real line and tends to 1 at infinity. Thus the Liouville theorem yields - 11 = ff- 11 = 1 and we prove the uniqueness of f and [formula]. The uniqueness of [formula] and g can be obtained by analogy.

Suppose Ψ satisfies ([\ref=E:Laxini]), Ψ(x,y,  ·  )∈D, and [formula]. If for i = 1,  2. Then

[formula]

Where Lλ  =  ∂y  -  λ∂x.

The λ-independence of [formula] has been proved by Theorem 6.5 in [\cite=DT07]. We can use the same method to show the λ-independence of [formula]. That is, by ([\ref=E:fact1]) and a direct computation, we have

[formula]

Note ([\ref=E:fact2]), ([\ref=E:fact3]) imply that [formula] is holomorphic at z, [formula]. Using ([\ref=E:fact2]), ([\ref=E:Laxini]) and the left side of ([\ref=E:rewrite]), one has that [formula] is holomorphic outside {z,  }. Moreover, [formula] is bounded at ∞   by g2∈Dr, ([\ref=E:Laxini]), and the left side of ([\ref=E:rewrite]). By the Liouville's theorem, [formula] is independent of λ.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:cauchy2]: Since ([\ref=E:chiral]) is the compatibility condition of ([\ref=E:Lax01]), ([\ref=E:Lax02]). To prove Theorem [\ref=T:cauchy2], it is sufficient to show the following theorem.

For [formula], k  ≥  7, if Z = Z(Ψ0) is finite and [formula], then [formula], Q(x,y,t) such that

[formula]

Moreover, for i + j + h  ≤  N, and [formula] fixed,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=L:decom], one has Ψ0  =  0g0  =  0f0 with f0,  0∈Dc, g0, 0∈Dr and ([\ref=E:diff5]), ([\ref=E:boundary5]) being satisfied. Since Z = Z(Ψ0) is finite and [formula]. Successively multiplying Ψ0 by factors as [formula], [formula], one obtains

[formula]

and for i + j  ≤  k - 4, and [formula], Where C is a scalar which is independent of x, y. Moreover, by ([\ref=E:mixfg]), ([\ref=E:c+]), and Theorem [\ref=T:uhlenbeck], one can factorize

To prove the theorem, it is equivalent to showing the solvability of the following Cauchy problem

[formula]

as well for i + j + h  ≤  k - 4, and [formula] fixed, Since ([\ref=E:Lax032]), ([\ref=E:Lax042]) follow by computing the compatibility conditions of ([\ref=E:mixLax032]), ([\ref=E:mixLax042]). We are going to justify the solvability by inducing on the length k (the multiplicity) in ([\ref=E:mixlength]).

For k = 1, by ([\ref=E:mixLaxini]), ([\ref=E:mixfact]), Lemma [\ref=L:tail], there exist A'r,0(x,y), Ac,0(x,y) such that

[formula]

By ([\ref=E:mixLaxiniL]), ([\ref=E:mixfg]), ([\ref=E:diff9]), ([\ref=E:boundary9]) and Theorem [\ref=T:cauchydiscrete], one can find

[formula]

and for i + j + h  ≤  k - 4, [formula] fixed, By ([\ref=E:mixLaxiniR]), ([\ref=E:mixfg]), ([\ref=E:diff9]), ([\ref=E:boundary9]), Lemma [\ref=L:decom], and Theorem [\ref=T:cauchy], one can find

[formula]

and for i + j + h  ≤  k - 4, [formula], Therefore, applying Theorem [\ref=T:backlund], we can find a unique

[formula]

such that Ψ' satisfies ([\ref=E:mixLax032]), ([\ref=E:mixLax042]), ([\ref=E:diff10]), ([\ref=E:boundary10]), and Z('(x,y,t,  ·  )) = {α1}.

One the other hand, by ([\ref=E:mixfact]), ([\ref=E:mixfg]), ([\ref=E:mixLaxiniL]), ([\ref=E:mixLaxiniR]), and Theorem [\ref=T:backlundinitial], we have Ψ0(x,y,λ), 0(x,y,λ), '0(x,y,λ) are the unique functions which satisfiy ([\ref=E:mixLaxini]). Since g'(x,y,0,λ) = g'0(x,y,λ), f(x,y,0,λ) = f0(x,y,λ), we derive Ψ'(x,y,0,λ) = Ψ'0(x,y,λ). As a result, A'(x,y,0) = A'0(x,y) by ([\ref=E:mixLaxini]), ([\ref=E:mixLax032]) and we prove the theorem in case of k = 1.

For k > 1, we define

[formula]

Then ([\ref=E:mixfact]), ([\ref=E:mixlength]), ([\ref=E:mixfactk1]), ([\ref=E:mixfactk2]) imply

[formula]

So by ([\ref=E:mixLaxini]), ([\ref=E:mixfactk])-([\ref=E:phiR]), and Lemma [\ref=L:tail], there exist A''L,0(x,y), A''R,0(x,y) such that

[formula]

Hence one can prove the theorem in case of k > 1 by repeating the previous arguments except using the induction hypothesis to obtain the solution of the Cauchy problem

[formula]

We conclude this report by a brief remark on examples of [formula], k  ≥  7, and Z(Ψ0) <   ∞  . First we let v(x,y,λ) = v(x + λy,λ) satisfy

[formula]

and for [formula], j,  h  ≥  0,

[formula]

Here S is the space of Schwartz functions. We can solve the inverse problem and obtain ψ0∈S by the argument in proving Theorem [\ref=T:LNexistence]. Note here we need to use the reality condition v = v* > 0 to show the global solvability. Moreover, by using the fomula [formula], one obtains that q0 is Schwartz and possesses purely continuous scattering data.

Therefore, one can successively apply the theory of adding (or substracting) 1-soliton in [\cite=DTU] to construct Q0 such that [formula], k  ≥  7, and Z(Ψ0) <   ∞  .
