Introduction

Let SN is unit sphere in RN

[formula]

The sphere SN is naturally equipped with a positive measure dσ(x) and with an elliptic second order differential operator Δs, which named the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere. This operator is symmetric and nonnegative, it extends to a nonnegative self-adjoint operator on the space L2(SN) (by Lp(SN) we mean the Lp-space associated with the measure dσ(x) on the sphere). Let c be any positive number, and let A = Δs + 1. We denote by Spec(A) = {λk,k = 0,1,2,...} the spectrum of A. This spectrum is nondecreasing sequence of positive eigenvalues with finite multiplicities (and written as such) tending to infinity. We denote by Ykj(x) an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator.

[formula]

where λk = k(k + N - 1),k = 0,1,2.... The system of eigendunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is orthonormal basis in L(2SN). One of the main problems of harmonic analysis is the reconstruction of functions from their expansion:

in ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=eq1]) denoted by Yk(f,x)

[formula]

where [formula] is Zonal harmonic of order k. A spectral function Θ(x,y,λ) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on sphere is defined by

[formula]

Then the spectral expansions of the ([\ref=eq1]) can be rewritten as follow

[formula]

The Riesz means of the spectral expansions ([\ref=eq1]) is defined buy the next expression

where by [formula] denoted the Riesz means of the spectral function ([\ref=eq2]):

[formula]

Let us denote by [formula] the Cesaro means of the spectral expansions, which defined as follow

The maximal operator of the Integral operator ([\ref=eq3]) plays important role in establishing the almost everywhere convergent of spectral expansions

[formula]

Let [formula] is the class Lioville, which consists of all functions from Lp(SN), for which

[formula]

Main result of this paper is

Let [formula] then 1) [formula] 2) The Riesz means [formula] almost everywhere on SN converges to f(x).

Note that, if τ > N then Riesz means of spectral expansions uniformly convergence to f (see [\cite=Al]). In work [\cite=Bas] was investigated spectral expansions related to the Pseudo-differential operators and in the [\cite=Buv] considered spectral expansions of elliptic differential operators.

Preliminaries

In this section we recall some preliminaries concerning some properties of Liuoville space and Riesz means.

Let τ  ≥  0,α  ≥  0,p  ≥  1, then for all f∈C∞(SN) we have

[formula]

The proof of this lemma it follows from embedding properties of Liouvill space. For more details see [\cite=Al].

Let [formula] is the Riesz means of the spectral function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on sphere and 1) if spherical distance γ  =  γ(x,y) between x and y satisfied inequality [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

2) if 0  ≤  γ  ≤  π, then we have

[formula]

3) if 0 < γ0  ≤  γ  ≤  π, then we have

[formula]

This lemma proved in our work [\cite=Akh].

Let [formula] then for maximal operator of Riesz means we have

[formula]

Proof. For all τ  ≥  0 let us denote by [formula] the kernel of the integral operator [formula]:

[formula]

Let g = Aτ / 2f. Using the equality

[formula]

we can rewrite the Riesz means as follow

[formula]

The kernel [formula] we reduce to the next form

[formula]

[formula]

Using this representation for the kernel [formula] we can estimate the Riesz means of the spectral expansions as follow:

here we denoted by [formula] the maximal function of the function d(x) which defined by the formula

[formula]

where B(x,r) is the ball in the unit sphere with the center at the point x and the radius r:

Due to estimation 1) of lemma [\ref=sp] we have for I2
