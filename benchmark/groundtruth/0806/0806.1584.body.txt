Introduction

For K / F a quadratic extension of p-adic fields, let σ be the conjugation relative to this extension, and ηK / F be the character of F* with kernel norms of K*. If π is a smooth irreducible representation of GL(n,K), and χ a character of F*, the dimension of the space of linear forms on its space, which transform by χ under GL(n,F) (with respect to the action

Preliminaries

Let φ be a group automorphism, and x an element of the group, we sometimes note xφ instead of φ(x), and x-  φ the inverse of xφ. If φ  =  x  ↦  h- 1xh for h in the group, then xh designs xφ.

Let G be a locally compact totally disconnected group, H a closed subgroup of G. We note ΔG the module of G, given by the relation dG(gx) = ΔG(g)dG(x), for a right Haar measure dG on G. Let X be a locally closed subspace of G, with H.X  ⊂  X. If V is a complex vector space, we note D(X,V) the space of smooth V-valued functions on X with compact support (if [formula], we simply note it D(X)). Let ρ be a a smooth representation of H in a complex vector space Vρ, we note [formula] the space of smooth Vρ-valued functions f on X, with compact support modulo H, which verify f(hx) = ρ(h)f(x) for h∈H and x∈X (if ρ is a character, we note it [formula]). We note indGH(ρ) the representation by right translations of G in [formula].

Let F be a non archimedean local field of characteristic zero, and K a quadratic extension of F. We have K  =  F(δ) with δ2 in F*. We note | |K and | |F the modules of K and F respectively. We note σ the non trivial element of the Galois group G(K / F) of K over F, and we use the same letter to design for its action on Mn(K). We note NK / F the norm of the extension K / F and we note ηK / F the nontrivial character of F* which is trivial on NK / F(K*). Whenever G is an algebraic group defined over F, we note G(K) its K-points and G(F) its F-points.

The group GL(n) will be noted Gn, its standard Borel subgroup will be noted Bn, its unipotent radical Un, and the standard maximal split torus of diagonal matrices Tn.

We note S the space of matrices M in Gn(K) satisfying MMσ = 1.

Everything in this paragraph is more or less contained in [\cite=F1], we give detailed proofs here for convenience of the reader.

We have a homeomorphism between Gn(K) / Gn(F) and S given by the map Sn:g  ↦  gσg- 1.

For its natural action on S, each orbit of Bn(K) contains one and only one element of [formula] of order 2 or 1.

We begin with the following:

There exists r  ≤  n / 2 such that up to conjugacy, w is (1,2)(3,4)...(2r - 1,2r).

We write [formula], hence for i  ≤  r, we have ziσ(zi') = 1, and zjσ(zj) = 1 for j  ≥  2r + 1. Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that each zj,j  ≥  2r + 1 is of the form uj - 2r  /  σ(uj - 2r), for some uj - 2r∈K*. We then take [formula].

The group N(K) has a composition series 1N  =  N0  ⊂  N1  ⊂  ...Nn - 1  ⊂  Nn = N(K), such that each quotient Ni + 1 / Ni is isomorphic to (K, + ), and each commutator subgroup [formula] is a subgroup of Ni. Now we prove the Lemma by induction on n: If n = 1, then N(K) is isomorphic to (K, + ), one concludes taking a  =  x / 2. n  ↦  n + 1: suppose the Lemma is true for every N(K) of length n. Let N(K) be of length n + 1, we note x̄ the class of x in N(K) / N1. By induction hypothesis, one gets that there exists an element in h∈N1, and an element u in N(K) such that x = θ(u- 1)uh. Here h lies in the center of N(K), because [formula]. As xθ(x)  =  1, we get hθ(h) = 1. By induction hypothesis again, we get h = θ(b- 1)b for b∈N1. We then take a  =  ub.

We get back to the proof of the Proposition [\ref=order2].

For w in [formula], one notes Uw the subgroup of Un generated by the elementary subgroups Uα, with α positive, and wα negative, and Uw' the subgroup of Un generated by the elementary subgroups Uα, with α positive, and wα positive. Then Un  =  Uw'Uw. Let s be in S. According to Bruhat's decomposition, there is w in [formula], and a in Tn(K), n1 in Un(K) and n2+ in Uw, such that s = n1awn2+, with unicity of the decomposition. Then s = s-  σ  =  n2 + -  σw- 1a-  σn1-  σ. Thus we have aw  =  (aw)-  σ, i.e. w2 = 1 and aw  =  a-  σ. Now we write n1-  σ  =  u-u+ with u-∈Uw' and u+∈Uw, comparing s and s-  σ, u+ must be equal to n2+. Hence s = n1awu - - 1n1-  σ, thus we suppose s = awn, with n in Uw'. From s = s-  σ, one has the relation awn(aw)- 1  =  n-  σ, applying σ on each side, this becomes (aw)- 1nσaw  =  n- 1. But θ:u  ↦  (aw)- 1uσaw is an involutive automorphism of Uw', hence from Lemma [\ref=nilp2], there is u' in Uw' such that n  =  θ(u- 1)u. This gives s = u-  σawu, so that we suppose s = aw. Again waσw  =  a- 1, and applying Lemma [\ref=nilp1] to θ':x  ↦  wxσw, we deduce that a is of the form yθ'(y- 1), and s = ywy-  σ.

Let u be the element [formula] of M2(K); one has [formula] (cf. Proposition [\ref=cohom]). We notice for further use (cf. proof of Proposition 3.1), that if we note T̃ the subgroup [formula], then [formula].

For r  ≤  n / 2, one notes Ur the n  ×  n matrix given by the following block decomposition: [formula]

If w is an element of [formula] naturally injected in Gn(K), one notes Uwr  =  w- 1Urw.

The elements Uwr for 0  ≤  r  ≤  n / 2, and [formula] give a complete set of representatives of classes of [formula].

Let [formula] be the Bruhat decomposition of Gn. We call a double-class BwB a Bruhat cell.

Choose C1  =  Bn. It is closed in Gn. Now let w2 be an element of [formula], with minimal length. Then from 8.5.5. of [\cite=Sp], one has that the Bruhat cell Bw2B is closed in Gn  -  Bn with respect to the Zariski topology, hence for the p-adic topology, we call it C2. We conclude by repeating this process.

One can order the classes A1,..., At of [formula], so that Ai is closed in [formula].

From the proof of Proposition [\ref=order2], we know that if C is a Bruhat cell of Gn, then [formula] is either empty, or it corresponds through the homemorphism Sn to a class A of [formula]. The conclusion follows the preceeding Lemma.

Each Ai is locally closed in Gn(K) for the Zariski topology.

We will also need the following Lemma:

Let v∈Vρ, U an open subset of G that intersects X, small enough for h  ↦  ρ(h)v to be trivial on [formula]. Let f' be the function with support in [formula] defined by hx  ↦  ρ(h)v. Such functions generate [formula] as a vector space. Now let f be the function of D(X,Vρ) defined by [formula], then Φ(f) is a multiple of f'. But for x in [formula], [formula] because h  ↦  ρ(h)v is trivial on [formula], plus h  ↦  f(hx) is a positive function that multiplies v, and f(x) = V, so F(f)(x) is v multiplied by a strictly positive scalar.

Let Y be a closed subset of X, H-stable, then the restriction map from [formula] to [formula] is surjective.

This is a consequence of the known surjectivity of the restriction map from D(X) to D(Y), which implies the surjectivity of the restriction from D(X,Vρ) to D(Y,Vρ) and of the commutativity of the diagram:

[formula].

Distinguished principal series

If π is a smooth representation of Gn(K) of space Vπ, and χ is a character of F*, we say that π is χ-distinguished if there exists on Vπ a nonzero linear form L such that L(π(g)v) = χ(det(g))L(v) whenever g is in Gn(F) and v belongs to Vπ. If χ is trivial, we simply say that π is distinguished.

We first recall the following:

Let π be a smooth irreducible distinguished representation of Gn(K), then [formula].

Let χ1,...,χn be n characters of K*, with none of their quotients equal to | |K. We note χ the character of Bn(K) defined by [formula]. We note π(χ) the representation of Gn(K) by right translation on the space of functions [formula]. This representation is smooth, irreducible and called the principal series attached to χ. If π is a smooth representation of Gn(K), we note [formula] its smooth contragredient.

We will need the following Lemma:

We now come to the principal results:

Let [formula] be a character of Tn(K), suppose that the principal series representation π(χ) is distinguished, there exists a re-ordering of the χi's, and r  ≤  n / 2, such that χσi + 1  =  χi- 1 for i = 1,3,..,2r - 1, and that χi|F* = 1 for i  >  2r.

We write B = Bn(K), G = Gn(K). We have from Corollary [\ref=closedclasses] and [\ref=res] the following exact sequence of smooth Gn(F)-modules:

[formula]

Hence there is a non zero distinguished linear form either on [formula], or on [formula]. In the second case we have the exact sequence

[formula]

Repeating the process, we deduce the existence of a non zero distinguished linar form on one of the spaces [formula]. From Corollary [\ref=2bclasses], we choose w in Sn and r  ≤  n / 2 such that Ai  =  BUwrGn(F). The application [formula] gives an isomorphism of Gn(F)-modules between [formula] and [formula] where Δ'(x)  =  Δ- 1 / 2B(UwrxU- wr) and χ'(x)  =  χ(UwrxU- wr). Now there exists a nonzero Gn(F)-invariant linear form on [formula] if and only if Δ'χ' is equal to the inverse of the module of [formula] (cf.[\cite=BH], ch.1, prop.3.4). From this we deduce that χ' is positive on [formula] or equivalently χ is positive on [formula]. Let [formula] be the F-torus of matrices of the form

[formula]

with 2r + t = n, zi∈K*, xi∈F*, then one has [formula], so that χ must be positive on w. We  remark  that  if χ is  unitary,  then χ is  trivial  on w, and π(χ) is  of  the desired form. For the general case, we deduce from Theorem [\ref=autodual], that there exists three integers p  ≥  0,q  ≥  0,s  ≥  0 such that up to reordering, we have χ2i  =  χ-  σ2i - 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  p, we have χ2p  +  k|F* = 1 for 1  ≤  k  ≤  q and these χ2p + k's are different (so that χ2p + k  ≠  χ-  σ2p + k' for k  ≠  k'), and χ2p   +   q   +   j|F*  =  ηK / F for 1  ≤  j  ≤  s, these χ2p  +  q  +  j's being different. We note μk  =  χ2p  +  k for q  ≥  k  ≥  1, and νk'  =  χ2p + q + k' for s  ≥  k'  ≥  1. We show that if such a character χ is positive on a conjugate of [formula] by an element of Sn, then s = 0. Supose ν1 appears, then either ν1 is positive on F*, but that is not possible, or it is coupled with another χi, and (ν1,χi) is positive on elements (z,zσ), for z in K*. Suppose χi  =  νj for some j  ≠  1, then (ν1,χi) is unitary, so it must be trivial on couples (z,zσ), which implies ν1  =  νj-  σ  =  νj, which is absurd. The character χi cannot be of the form μj, because it would imply ν1|F* = 1. The last case is i  ≤  2p, then ν1-  σ  =  ν1 must be the unitary part of χi because of the positivity of (ν1,χi) on the couples (z,zσ). But χi-  σ also appears and is not trivial on F*, hence must be coupled with another character χj with j  ≤  2p and j  ≠  i, such that (χi-  σ,χj) is positive on the elements (z,zσ), for z in K*, which implies that χj has unitary part ν1-  σ  =  ν1. The character χj cannot be a μk because of its unitary part. If it is a χk with k  ≤  2p, we consider again χk-  σ . But repeating the process lengthily enough, we can suppose that χj is of the form νk, for k  ≠  1. Taking unitary parts, we see that νk  =  ν1-  σ  =  ν1, which is in contradiction with the fact that all νi's are different. We conclude that s = 0.

Let [formula] be a character of Tn(K), the principal series representation π(χ) is distinguished if and only if there exists r  ≤  n / 2, such that χσi + 1  =  χi- 1 for i = 1,3,..,2r - 1, and that χi|F* = 1 for i  >  2r.

There is one implication left. Suppose χ is of the desired form, then π(χ) is parabolically (unitarily) induced from representations of the type π(χi,χi-  σ) of G2(K), and distinguished characters of K*. Hence, because of Lemma [\ref=induced] the Theorem will be proved if we know that the representations π(χi,χi-  σ) are distinguished, but this is Corollary [\ref=cordist2] of the next paragraph.

This gives a counter-example to a conjecture of Jacquet (conjecture 1 in [\cite=A]), asserting that if an irreducible admissible representation π of Gn(K) verifies that [formula] is isomorphic to πσ, then it is distinguished if n is odd, and it is distinguished or ηK / F-distinguished if n is even.

For n  ≥  3, there exist smooth irreducible representations π of Gn(K), with central character trivial on F*, that are neither distinguished, nor ηK / F-distinguished, but verify that [formula] is isomorphic to πσ.

Take [formula], all different, such that χ1|F*  =  χ2|F*  =  ηK / F, and χj|F* = 1 for 3  ≤  j  ≤  n. Because each χi has trivial restriction to NK / F(K*), it is equal to χ-  σi, hence [formula] is isomorphic to πσ. Another consequence is that if k and l are two different integers between 1 and n, then χk  ≠  χ-  σl, because we supposed the χi's all different. Then it follows from Theorem [\ref=dist] that [formula] is neither distinguished, nor ηK / F-distinguished, but clearly, the central character of π is trivial on F* and [formula] is isomorphic to πσ.

Distinction and gamma factors for GL(2)

As said in the introduction, in this section we generalize to smooth infinite dimensional irreducible representations of G2(K) a criterion of Hakim (cf. [\cite=H], Theorem 4.1) characterising smooth unitary irreducible distinguished representations of G2(K). In proof of Theorem 4.1 of [\cite=H], Hakim deals with unitary representations so that the integrals of Kirillov functions on F* with respect to a Haar measure of F* converge. We skip the convergence problems using Proposition 2.9 of chapter 1 of [\cite=JL].

We note M(K) the mirabolic subgroup of G2(K) of matrices of the form [formula] with a in K* and x in K, and M(F) its intersection with G2(F). We note w the matrix [formula]. Let π be a smooth infinite dimensional irreducible representation of G2(K), it is known that it is generic (cf.[\cite=Z] for example). Let K(π,ψ) be its Kirillov model corresponding to ψ ([\cite=JL], th. 2.13), it contains the subspace D(K*) of functions with compact support on the group K*. If φ belongs to K(π,ψ), and x belongs to K, then [formula] belongs to D(K*) ([\cite=JL], prop.2.9, ch.1), from this follows that K(π,ψ) = D(K*)  +  π(w)D(K*).

We now recall a consequence of the functional equation at 1/2 for Kirillov representations (cf. [\cite=B], section 4.7). Forall φ in K(π,ψ) and χ character of K*, we have whenever both sides converge absolutely:

[formula]

where d*x is a Haar measure on K*, and cπ is the central character of π.

Let π be a smooth irreducible representation of G2(K) of infinite dimension with central character trivial on F*, and ψ a nontrivial character of K trivial on F. If [formula] for every character χ of K* trivial on F*, then π is distinguished.

In fact, using a Fourier inversion in functional equation [\ref=eq] and the change of variable x  ↦  x- 1, we deduce that forall φ in [formula], we have

[formula]

(d*t is a Haar measure on F*) which for x = 1 gives

[formula]

Now we define on K(π,ψ) a linear form λ by:

[formula]

for φ1 and φ2 in D(K*), which is well defined because of the previous equality and the fact that K(π,ψ) = D(K*) + π(w)D(K*).

It is clear that λ is w-invariant. As the central character of π is trivial on F*, λ is also F*-invariant. Because GL2(F) is generated by M(F), its center, and w, it remains to show that λ is M(F)-invariant. Since ψ is trivial on F, one has if φ∈D(K*) and m∈M(F) the equality λ(π(m)φ)  =  λ(φ) . Now if φ  =  π(w)φ2∈π(w)D(K*), and if a belongs to F*, then [formula] because the central character of π is trivial on F*, and [formula]. If x∈F, then [formula] is a function in D(K*), which vanishes on F*, hence [formula].

Eventually λ is M(F)-invariant, hence G2(F)-invariant, it is clear that its restriction to D(K*) is non zero.

Let μ be a character of K*, then π(μ,μ-  σ) is distinguished.

indeed, first we notice that the central character μμ-  σ of π(μ,μ-  σ) is trivial on F*. Now let χ be a character of K*  /  F*, then [formula], and as ψ|F = 1 and χ|F* = 1, one has ψσ  =  ψ- 1 and χσ  =  χ- 1, so that γ(π(χ,χ-  σ),ψ) = γ(μχ,ψ)γ(μ- 1χ- 1,ψ- 1) = 1. The conclusion falls from Proposition [\ref=gamma1].

Assuming Theorem 1.2 of [\cite=AG], the converse of Theorem [\ref=gamma1] is also true:

Let π be a smooth irreducible representation of infinite dimension of G2(K) with central character trivial on F* and ψ a non trivial character of K / F, it is distinguished if and only if [formula] for every character χ of K* trivial on F*.

It suffices to show that if π is a smooth irreducible distinguished representation of infinite dimension of G2(K), and ψ a non trivial character of K / F, then γ(π,ψ) = 1. Suppose λ is a non zero G2(F)-invariant linear form on K(π,ψ), it is shown in the proof of the corollary of Proposition 3.3 in [\cite=H], that its restriction to D(F*) must be a multiple of the Haar measure on F*. Hence for any function φ in [formula], we must have [formula]. From this one deduces that for any function in [formula]:

[formula]

This implies that either γ(π,ψ) is equal to one, or [formula] is equal to zero on [formula]. In the second case, we could define two independant K*-invariant linear forms on K(π,ψ) = D(K*)  +  π(w)D(K*), given by [formula], and [formula]. This would contradict Theorem 1.2 of [\cite=AG].
