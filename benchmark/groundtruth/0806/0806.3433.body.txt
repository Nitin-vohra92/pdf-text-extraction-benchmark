1. Preliminaries.

We recall that a t - (v,k,rt) design D = (P,B) is a finite set P with |P| = v, the elements of which are called points , together with a family B of subsets of P, called blocks , such that any block contains exactly k points and t points are contained in exactly rt blocks. For any s < t, any t - (v,k,rt) design D is an s - (v,k,rs) design with

[formula]

The number r1 of blocks containing any given point is consequently a constant. It is usual to denote r1 simply by r and r2 by λ. If we denote by b = |B| the number of blocks, a necessary condition for the existence of a t - (v,k,rt) design is vr = bk.

Labelling the points of P with [formula] and the blocks of B with [formula], the incidence matrix A = (aij) of D is defined putting

[formula]

It holds [formula], where J is the v  ×  v matrix the entries of which are all equal 1. It follows that [formula]. A 2-design where v = b, or equivalently r = k, is called symmetric and its incidence matrix is such that [formula].

The complementary design of D = (P,B) is the t - (v,v - k,) design  = (P,) where [formula] is the set of (v - k)-tuples of P which are the complement [formula] of a block [formula]. Consequently, we have [formula].

The supplementary design of D = (P,B) is the [formula] design [formula] where [formula] is the set of unordered k-tuples of distinct points of P which are not blocks of B.

1. Remark: The t - (v,k,rt) design D is the complementary design of [formula] as well as the supplementary design of [formula]. The complementary design of the supplementary design of D is a [formula] design which is equal to the supplementary design of the complementary design of D.[formula]

The derived design of D = (P,B) at the point P is the design [formula] where [formula].

Lastly, we recall that a Steiner k-tuple system is a t - (v,k,rt) design with t = k - 1 and rt = 1. Among the Steiner quadruple systems, i. e. 3 - (v,4,1) designs, we find the boolean quadruple system of order 2n , which is defined, for n  ≥  3, as the 3 - (2n,4,1) design obtained putting B to be the set of all quadruples of distinct vectors of [formula] the sum of which is zero.

2. Embedding in a group.

We start by asking a natural question: what designs are subsets of a finite commutative group, so that the sum of the elements in a block is a constant? If this constant is zero, there is a unique way to define such a group. Let [formula] be the free commutative group generated by the v points of P and let [formula] be the subgroup of [formula] generated by the b elements of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a block of B. The subgroup [formula] is clearly generated by the rows of the incidence matrix of D. Finally, define the group [formula] and consider the map [formula], [formula].

2. Example: Let D be the 2 - (9,3,1) Steiner triple system. After reducing the rows of the incidence matrix by elementary integer linear combinations

[formula]

we find that [formula], and the (images of the) points of D are:

[formula]

Thus [formula]. This gives evidence of the fact that D is isomorphic to the point-line design of the affine plane of order 3. Now we consider the 2 - (9,6,5) design of pairs of parallel lines in the affine plane of order 3. Here, after reducing the rows of the incidence matrix

[formula]

we find that [formula], and the points of D are:

[formula]

We remark that it is unexpected that the coordinates of the points are precisely the same as before, apart from the first one. Moreover, even if the first coordinate is constant, it seems to plays an important rôle, since it distinguish blocks from the first case: note that (P1 + P2 + P3) and (P4 + P5 + P6) here are not zero, whereas (P1 + P2 + P3) + (P4 + P5 + P6) = (0;0,0,0).[formula]

In the following proposition, which has clearly a connection with the computation of the p-rank of the incidence matrix in [\cite=Hamada] and [\cite=DHV], shows that the exponent of [formula] divides k(r - λ).

3. Proposition: For any [formula] we have k(r - λ)x = 0. If D has a partition in blocks, then (r - λ)x = 0.

Proof. Summing the points of the r blocks through any given point X we find

[formula]

hence (r - λ)x = 0 , if D has a partition in blocks. Otherwise, let [formula] be the points of a given block, then

[formula]

As [formula], the assertion follows.[formula]

We remark that the injectivity of the map [formula], [formula], is not always guaranteed. In particular we find that, if [formula], any Steiner triple system D of cardinality v is not embeddable in [formula]. In fact, as a consequence of [\cite=DHV], we have that the b  ×  v incidence matrix of D has rank v over any field of characteristic [formula] and it has rank v - 1 over a field of characteristic p = 3. This forces [formula] to be a cyclic group of a 3-power order, but by the above Proposition the exponent of [formula] must be a divisor of 3. Since D has more than three points, we can see that P is not embeddable in [formula].

The following proposition, though trivial, has a fine corollary.

4. Proposition: The map is injective if and only if for any [formula] and for any permutation matrix H, we have

[formula]

[formula]

5. Corollary: (Irrationality condition for the injectivity): If the map is not injective, then there exists a vector [formula] such that

[formula]

Proof. The assertion follows from the fact that, for any permutation matrix H, we have [formula]. [formula]

6. Corollary: A symmetric 2 - (v,k,λ) design D is embeddable in [formula] (unless D is a triangle).

Proof. It is known that a 2-design is symmetric if and only if [formula]. Hence, for any non-zero integer b-tuple [formula], we have

[formula]

[formula]

As pointed out in Proposition 3, it is necessary that the exponent of [formula] is a divisor of k(r - λ). Now we show that for the existence of a 2 - (v,k,λ) design having a p-group as the set of points it is sufficient that kx = 0.

7. Proposition: Let P be the Galois field with q = pt elements, p  ≥  2 a prime. For any k = mp, with 2 < k < q, let B be the family of unordered k-tuples of distinct elements of P the sum of which is zero. Then D = (P,B) is a 2 - (q,k,λ) design.

Proof. As the sum of the elements in the ground field is zero, we have that [formula]. Let now [formula], let Q1,Q2∈P and let ρ(X) = AX + T, with A,T∈P and [formula], be the affinity of the affine line defined on P, such that ρ(Pi) = Qi. Then

[formula]

As [formula] we find that [formula] is in B, hence the number of unordered k-tuples of B containing Q1,Q2 is equal to the number of unordered k-tuples of B containing P1,P2.[formula]

8. Remark: A remarkable case is when k = p and P is an n-dimensional affine space over a Galois field with pm elements, m > 1.[formula]

3. Boolean designs.

In this section we consider the case p = 2.

9. Proposition: Let P be a n-dimensional affine space over the Galois field with 2 elements. For any k = 2m, with 2 < k < 2n, let B be the family of unordered k-tuples of distinct elements of P the sum of which is zero. Then D = (P,B) is a 3 - (2n,k,r3) design.

Proof. Since a line in P cannot contain three points and the group of affinity is transitive on the triangles, we can move any three distinct points of P onto any three distinct points of P with an affinity. The proof follows as in Proposition 7.[formula]

In addition to the above one, in the following proposition we apply the fact that GLn(2) is transitive on the pairs of non-zero distinct vectors of [formula]. For k = 3 we find precisely the classical point-line design of a projective space on [formula].

10. Proposition: Let P be the set of non-zero vectors of [formula] and, for any [formula], let Bk be the family of unordered k-tuples of distinct elements of P the sum of which is zero. Then Dk = (P,Bk) is a 2 - (v = 2n - 1,k,λk) design such that [formula]. Consequently we have [formula] where

[formula]

[formula]

11. Remark: According to [\cite=Schatz] (see also sequences A010085-89 in [\cite=OEIS]), the numbers bk of blocks of Dk are equal to the weights of the huge (2n - 1,2n - n - 1,3)-Hamming code C, whereas the numbers [formula] of blocks of [formula] are the numbers of weights k vectors of a C which belong to weight 1 cosets of C. [formula]

12. Remark: The supplementary design [formula] of the above one is the [formula] design defined, for any 1 < k < 2n - 1, on the set P of non-zero vectors of [formula] by the family B of unordered k-tuples of distinct elements of P the sum of which is different from zero. [formula]

13. Remark: For k = 4 in Proposition 9 we get the boolean system of order 2n. We remark that in the affine space [formula] a necessary and sufficient condition for four distinct points to lie in an affine plane is that their sum is zero, that is the boolean quadruple system of order 2n is the classical design of two-dimensional subspaces of an affine space over [formula]. Consider now the design where k = 8. We remark that, in the affine spaces [formula] and [formula], a necessary and sufficient condition for eight distinct points [formula] to lye in a two disjoint planes is that their sum is zero. To see this, we can assume that any four of [formula] do not lie in a plane. Taking the sum of any three points of I, we get [formula] further points, not in I, which are mutually distinct, otherwise two of the eight points of I are equal. For n = 4,5 we get then a contradiction. Hence the design we get for n = 4,5 and k = 8 is the classical design of disjoint pairs of two-dimensional subspaces of an affine space over [formula]. Things change for [formula], because the following 8-ple, the sum of which is zero,

(0,0,0,0,0,0)  (1,0,0,0,0,0)  (0,1,0,0,0,0)  (0,0,1,0,0,0)

(0,0,0,1,0,0)  (0,0,0,0,1,0)  (0,0,0,0,0,1)  (1,1,1,1,1,1),

is not the disjoint union of two affine subplanes.[formula]

14. Definition: Let Dk = (P,Bk) be the 2 - (2n - 1,k,λk) design where P is the set of non-zero vectors of [formula] and Bk is the family of unordered k-tuples of distinct elements of P the sum of which is zero. We say that the block [formula] is reducible if it is the union of two disjoint blocks [formula], [formula], where k1 + k2 = k.

15. Proposition: Let [formula] be the canonical basis of [formula] and let [formula]. Then any block [formula] is irreducible if and only if [formula] is contained in the orbit of [formula] under GLn(2).

Proof. Let [formula] be an irreducible block. The claim follows if we show that [formula] are linearly independent. By contradiction, we may assume without loss of generality that [formula], with αj = 0,1, but not all zero. If any αj = 1, then [formula], a contradiction. Thus some αj = 0. But this forces [formula] to be reducible, a contradiction.[formula]

16. Corollary: The number of irreducible blocks [formula] is [formula]. [formula]

17. Remark: The family B of unordered k-tuples of linearly dependent vectors of P is such that [formula] if and only if [formula] contains a h-tuple of non-zero vectors the sum of which is zero, for some h  ≤  k. This shows that D = (P,B) is a 2-design, the supplementary of which is the 2-design defined by the family [formula] of unordered k-tuples of linearly independent vectors of P. [formula]
