Decomposition of phase space andClassification of Heisenberg groups

Introduction

In his mathematical formulation of quantum kinematics [\cite=Weyl50], Hermann Weyl introduced the concept of Heisenberg group as a special kind of central extension of an abelian group (which is thought of as phase space) by the circle group. His formulation allowed the phase space to be quite general, and besides real vector spaces, he considered finite abelian groups. A natural class of Heisenberg groups are the standard Heisenberg groups defined in Section [\ref=sec:defin-heis-groups], where the phase space is the product of a locally compact abelian group (thought of as position space) with its Pontryagin dual (thought of as momentum space). However, the theory of Heisenberg groups can be formulated independently of such a decomposition (see, for example [\cite=MR1116553]). In some important applications, the phase space associated to a Heisenberg group does not come with any natural decomposition into position and momentum spaces. In fact, it is not known to the authors whether such a decomposition exists in general.

In this article it is shown that, in a large number of cases including many of the standard examples, such a decomposition of the phase space exists and that the Heisenberg group is isomorphic to a standard Heisenberg group. In fact, the isomorphism class of the phase space (as a locally compact abelian group) determines the Heisenberg group up to isomorphism. We rely on known structure theorems for certain families of locally compact abelian groups. Since no structure theorem is available for locally compact abelian groups in general (even self-dual ones), new ideas may be needed to tackle the general case.

The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section [\ref=sec:defin-heis-groups], we recall the definition of Heisenberg group following [\cite=MR1116553] and introduce standard Heisenberg groups. In Section [\ref=sec:heis-lie-groups], we treat the case where the phase space is a Lie group. Isomorphism classes of Lie Heisenberg groups are found to be in canonical bijective correspondence with isomorphism classes of abelian Lie groups with finitely many connected components. In Section [\ref=sec:divis-tors-free], we treat the case where the phase space is a divisible and torsion-free locally compact abelian group. This includes Heisenberg groups whose phase space is a finite Cartesian product of local fields of characteristic zero and adèles of algebraic number fields. Isomorphism classes of Heisenberg groups with divisible torsion-free phase space are found to be in canonical bijective correspondence with divisible torsion free groups whose identity component is a Lie group. In Section [\ref=sec:groups-prime-expon], we treat the case where the phase space is of prime exponent (every non-trivial element has order p for a fixed prime number p). This includes Heisenberg groups whose phase space is a finite Cartesian product of local fields and adèles of global function fields of characteristic p. Isomorphism classes of Heisenberg groups with phase space of exponent p are found to be in canonical bijective correspondence with direct products of cyclic groups of order p.

Our results provide a simple minimal framework within which the study of many questions involving a large class of Heisenberg groups can be carried out. The classification of finite Heisenberg groups can be interpreted as the fact that the number of irreducible n- dimensional abelian groups of unitary rotations in ray space (see [\cite=Weyl50]) is the same as the number of isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order n (see [\cite=cow]).

Definition of Heisenberg Group

Let K be a locally compact abelian group, and [formula]. Consider a locally compact group G which is a central extension:

[formula]

The commutator map G  ×  G  →  U(1) defined by (g,h)  ↦  ghg- 1h- 1 descends to an alternating bicharacter e:K  ×  K  →  U(1) known as the commutator form. Thus, e is a homomorphism in each variable separately, and e(k,k) = 1 for all k∈K. Let [formula] denote the Pontryagin dual of K. Then a homomorphism [formula] is obtained by setting

[formula]

In this case, e is said to be a non-degenerate alternating bicharacter. In general, if K is a locally compact abelian group and c:K  ×  K  →  U(1) is a 2- cocycle (often called a multiplier) so that G can be realized as U(1)  ×  K with the group structure given by then e(k,l) = c(k,l)c(l,k)- 1. It is not difficult to see that c  ↦  e gives rise to an embedding of H2(K,U(1)) into the group of alternating bicharacters of K. Thus the data (K,e), where K is a locally compact abelian group and e is a non-degenerate alternating bicharacter, determine the Heisenberg group G up to isomorphism of central extensions. We refer to K as the phase space associated to G.

Lie Heisenberg groups

A Lie group will be assumed to have countably many connected components.

K can be decomposed as where Kf is a finite abelian subgroup, [formula] is a subgroup isomorphic to the additive group of a finite dimensional real vector space, Kt is a subgroup isomorphic to a compact real torus, and [formula] is a finitely generated free abelian subgroup. Thus [formula] inherits a decomposition where f, [formula], t and [formula] are subgroups of [formula] isomorphic to the Pontryagin duals of Kf, [formula], [formula] and Kt respectively. The isomorphism [formula] can be written as a matrix (eij), where eij:Kj  →  i for [formula]. Many of these entries are forced to be trivial, as there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from some types of groups to others. We see immediately that [formula] has the form: Noting that [formula] must also have a similar matrix form, we conclude that eii must be an isomorphism for each [formula]. Given an automorphism α of K, let eα(k,l) = e(α(k),α(l)). The automorphism α itself can be represented by a matrix (αij) of a similar form, with αii an automorphism of Ki. We have

[formula]

Here α*:  →   is the transpose of α, defined by α*(ξ)(k) = ξ(α(k)) for k∈K, ξ∈. For the purpose of proving Theorem A, it is always permissible to replace e by eα.

Since eii is an isomorphism for each [formula], we may take [formula] such that [formula] for each [formula], and [formula] such that Consider

[formula]

Its transpose, in matrix form, is

[formula]

Furthermore, the fact that e is alternating means that [formula]. Consequently,

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:4]), ([\ref=eq:2]) and ([\ref=eq:1]), and by our choice of α in ([\ref=eq:3]), we see that

[formula]

Therefore, it suffices to prove Theorem A in the cases where K = Kf, [formula] and [formula] separately.

Analysis of the finite part

The argument from [\cite=iafhg] is repeated here for the sake of completeness. Choose a basis [formula] of Kf such that the order of xi is di with [formula]. Let ζ denote a fixed primitive d1- th root of unity. For each [formula], there exists a non-negative integer qij such that Observe that qij is determined modulo d1 and is constrained to be divisible by d1 / (di,dj). Let Q(e) denote the matrix (qij) associated to e as above.

Any automorphism αf of Kf is of the form for a suitable matrix (αij) of integers, where αij is determined modulo di and is constrained to be divisible by di / (di,dj). Furthermore, In the above expression, α is identified with its matrix (αij), so that α* is identified with the transpose matrix. In particular, Q(eα) can be obtained from Q(e) by a sequence of column operations followed by the corresponding sequence of row operations. The following operations are permitted:

multiplication of the ith row and ith column by an integer σ such that (σ,di) = 1.

interchange of ith and jth rows and columns when di = dj.

addition of σ times ith row to the jth row, and σ times the ith column to the jth column when di / (di,dj) divides σ.

Since e is alternating, Q(e) can be taken to be skew-symmetric with zeroes along the diagonal. Since e is non-degenerate, there must be an integer in the first row of Q(e) that is coprime to d1. First, βiσ for appropriate σ can be used to make this entry equal to 1. If this entry is in the jth column, then the constraints on qij force dj = d1. Now, π2j transforms the top-left corner of the matrix into [formula]. In particular d1 = d2. Finally, α1jσ and α2jσ can used to make the remaining entries of the first two rows and columns vanish.

The form e identifies the Pontryagin dual of the subgroup generated by the first (transformed) generator with the subgroup generated by the second one. After splitting off the subgroup spanned by these two generators, we are left with a finite abelian group with n - 2 generators. By induction on n, we conclude that there exists a finite abelian group Af, together with an isomorphism φf:A  ×  Â  →  Kf such that

Analysis of the real part

Since [formula] is the additive group of a finite dimensional vector space, e(k,l) = eiQ(k,l) for all [formula] with [formula] a symplectic form. It is well known in this case that [formula] must be an even dimensional vector space, and that Q can be transformed into the standard symplectic form by an automorphism of [formula]. Hence there exists a vector space [formula] and an isomorphism [formula] such that

Analysis of the toric and free parts

By ([\ref=eq:5]), we may assume that [formula]. Note that [formula] is an isomorphism of [formula] onto the Pontryagin dual of Kt. When At = Kt, and [formula] is [formula], we have

Divisible torsion-free phase space

According to [\cite=MR551496], K can be decomposed as where [formula] is a subgroup isomorphic to the additive group of a finite dimensional real vector space, [formula] is a restricted direct product (over all primes p) of finite dimensional vector spaces over p- adic fields, [formula] is a subgroup isomorphic to the additive group of a finite dimensional vector space over the rational numbers with the discrete topology, and Ks is a subgroup isomorphic to a finite Cartesian power of [formula]. The finite dimensionality of the vector spaces over [formula] is not part of the classification of divisible torsion-free groups in [\cite=MR551496], where the minimal divisible extension of an arbitrary Cartesian power of [formula] is allowed, but is a consequence of the fact that K is isomorphic to its own Pontryagin dual.

Likewise, [formula] can be decomposed as where [formula], [formula], [formula] and s are subgroups of [formula] isomorphic to the Pontryagin duals of [formula], [formula], Ks and [formula] respectively. As in Section [\ref=sec:heis-lie-groups], the isomorphism [formula] can be written as a matrix some of whose entries are forced to be 0. It is not difficult to see that [formula] must have the form: where eij is a homomorphism Kj  →  i. Proceeding as in Section [\ref=sec:heis-lie-groups], we reduce Theorem B to the cases where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The first case, the analysis of the real part, has already been dealt with in Section [\ref=sec:heis-lie-groups], and the third case is similar to the analysis of the toric and free parts treated there. It remains to address the case where [formula]. We know that [formula] is a restricted direct product: where, for each prime p, Kp is a finite dimensional vector space over [formula]. For p  ≠  q, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms Kp  →  q. Therefore [formula], when restricted to Kp, gives rise to an isomorphism ep:Kp  →  p, and we are reduced the case where K = Kp is a finite dimensional vector space over [formula]. Let ψ be a non-trivial character ψ∈p. Then we may write e(k,l) = ψ(Q(k,l)) for all k,l∈Kp, where [formula] is a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form. As in the real case, this form can be transformed into the standard symplectic from by an automorphism of Kp, and the result follows.

Phase space of prime exponent

Using a result of Braconnier (see [\cite=MR551496]) and the fact that K is self-dual, we see that there exists a unique cardinal number m such that K can be decomposed as where Kc is a direct product of m copies of [formula], a compact group under the product topology, and Kd is the direct sum (in the category of abelian groups) of m copies of [formula], and is endowed with the discrete topology. Therefore, [formula] has a decomposition where c and d are subgroups of [formula] isomorphic to the Pontryagin duals of Kd and Kc respectively. Write [formula] as a matrix

[formula]

where eij is a homomorphism Kj  →  i. The image of edc, being the continuous image of a compact group in a discrete one, is finite and may be thought of as a finite dimensional vector space over [formula]. Any lift of a basis extends to a homomorphism [formula]. Let [formula]. Then Kc  =   ker edc  ×  F. Now let Kc' =  ker edc and let Kd' = F  ×  Kd. Suppose that, with respect to the decompositions K = Kc'  ×  Kd' and   =  c'  ×  d' (where c' and d' are isomorphic to the Pontryagin duals of Kd' and Kc' respectively), [formula] has the matrix then edc' = 0. Now Theorem C can be obtained as in the analysis of the real and toric parts in Section [\ref=sec:heis-lie-groups].
