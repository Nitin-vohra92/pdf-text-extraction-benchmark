Computational Results

The previous formulations have been compared by means of a computational study (see Tables [\ref=freeSS], [\ref=nofreeSS] and [\ref=random]).

Improving formulations

Some of these formulations have been improved and solution method have been again computationally compared on the same testbed.

Table [\ref=f1mejor] reports a comparative analysis of the results provided when solving formulation (F1) with and without a separation method.

Table [\ref=VI] shows the running times when solving formulation (F2) with several sets of additional inequalities. A separation procedure have been implemented and the results are given in Table [\ref=KK]. The results of solving the preprocessed formulation (F2) are presented in Table [\ref=f2Pre].

[formula]

In Table [\ref=f3mejor], the results obtained for formulation (F3) with and without the modified objective function have been compared.

A comparison between (F5.1) with and without preprocessing is shown in Table [\ref=f51Pre].
