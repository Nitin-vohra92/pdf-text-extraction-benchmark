Abstract. Let Pn,k be the number of permutations π on [formula] such that the length of the longest increasing subsequences of π equals k, and let M2n,k be the number of matchings on

[formula]

The Conjectures

Let Pn(x) and M2n(x) be defined as in the abstract. We propose the following conjectures.

Pn(x) is log-concave for n  ≥  1.

Pn(x) is ∞  -log-concave for n  ≥  1.

The polynomial sequence {Pn(x)} is strongly q-log-convex.

The polynomial sequence {Pn(x)} is ∞  -q-log-convex.

M2n(x) is log-concave for n  ≥  1.

M2n(x) is ∞  -log-concave for n  ≥  1.

The polynomial sequence {M2n(x)} is strongly q-log-convex.

The polynomial sequence {M2n(x)} is ∞  -q-log-convex. Furthermore, the polynomials M2n(x) are log-concave of any order with respect to ∞  -q-log-convexity.

The following conjecture is concerned with the Boros-Moll polynomials�� [\cite=BM] [\cite=BM2]. The log-concavity is established by Kauser and Paule [\cite=kau].

The sequence of the Boros-Moll polynomials is ∞  -q-log-convex, and they are log-concave of any order with respect to ∞  -q-log-convexity.

The Background

The longest increasing subsequences of permutations have been extensively studied; see, for example, [\cite=baik1] [\cite=Berg1] [\cite=chen] [\cite=gessel] [\cite=regev], in particular, the survey of Stanley [\cite=stan4]. Baik, Deift and Johansson [\cite=baik1] have shown that the limiting distribution of the coefficients of Pn(x) is the Tracy-Widom distribution. The numbers Pn,k can be computed by Gessel's theorem [\cite=gessel]. Let [formula] be the symmetric group on
