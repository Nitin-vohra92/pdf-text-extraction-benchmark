On the non-existence of some Steiner t-(v,k) trades of certain volumes

Introduction

Let 0 < t < k < v be three natural numbers and let X be a v-set. For every i, 0  ≤  i  ≤  v, the set of all i-subsets of X will be denoted by Pi(X), and also for any i > 1, we will denote the set [formula] by [formula]. The elements of Pk(X) are called blocks. A t-(v,k) trade T = {T1,T2} consists of two disjoint collections of blocks, T1 and T2, such that every element of Pt(X) is contained in the same number of blocks in T1 and T2. For simplicity, the notation of t-trade is commonly used in this manuscript. Let T = {T1,T2} be a t-trade. Clearly, |T1| = |T2| and |T1| is called the volume of the T and is denoted by and sometimes we denote vol(T) by , if it causes no confusion. The subset of X which is covered by T1 and T2 is called the foundation of T and is denoted by . Repeated blocks in T1(T2) are allowed.

Trade with no repeated block is simple. A t-trade is called Steiner t-(v,k) trade if every element of Pt(X) appears in at most one block of T1(T2). It has been shown in [formula] that in every t-(v,k) trade, |found(T)|  ≥  k + t + 1, vol[formula]. A t-trade T with vol(T) = 2t and |found(T)| = k + t + 1 is called minimal. A minimal t-(v,k) trade is unique, up to isomorphism, and can be cast in the following form [formula], where xi∈ found(T). After a formal multiplication, the terms with plus (minus) signs are to be considered as block of T1(T2). Let T = {T1,T2} be a t-(v,k) trade of vol(T) = s and x,y∈ found(T). Then the number of blocks in T1(T2) which contains x is denoted by rx, and the number of blocks containing {x,y} (for [formula] is denoted by λxy. The set of blocks in T1(T2) which contains x∈ found(T) is denoted by T1x(T2x) and the set of remaining blocks by [formula]. It has been shown [formula] that if rx  <  s, then Tx  =  {T1x,T2x}, is a (t - 1)-(v,k) trade of vol(Tx) = rx, and furthermore, [formula] is a (t - 1)-(v - 1,k) trade of vol[formula]. If we remove x from the blocks of Tx then the result will be a (t - 1)-(v - 1,k - 1) trade which is called a derived trade of T and is denoted by DxT = {(DxT)1,(DxT)2}. It is easy to show that if T is a Steiner trade, then its derived trade is also a Steiner trade. If T = {T1,T2} and T*  =  {T*1,T*2} are two t-(v,k) trades, then we define [formula] and [formula]. Note that the blocks that appear in both sides are omitted. It is easy to see that T  ±  T* are also t-(v,k) trades. Let T be a t-(v,k) trade and T  ≠  Tx + Ty (for x,y∈ found(T)) then T - (Tx + Ty) is a (t - 1)-(v,k) trade with volume s - (rx + ry) + 2λxy [formula]. Hwang [formula] has shown that there is no 2-(v,k) trade of volume s = 5, and as a generalization, she has also shown that t-trades with s = 2t + 1 do not exist, Mahmoodian and Soltankhah [formula] have shown that: Also in [\cite=MMS], the following conjecture has been stated:

[\cite=MMS]. There does not exist any t-(v,k) trade of volume s such that [formula].

In fact Theorem A is the answer for the conjecture for i = 0. Gray and Ramsay [formula], showed that no 3-(v,4) trade of s = 13 exists, and they also proved a generalization of this: For t  ≥  3, t-(v,t + 1) trades of volume s = 2t  +  2t - 1 + 1 do not exist. Of course this is a partial solution for i = 1 of the conjecture. Prior to this proof, in [formula] it is shown that there does not exist any Steiner 3-(v,4) trade of s = 13. Hoorfar and G.B. Khosrovshahi [formula] established the correctness of this conjecture for Steiner trades, for i = 1. In this paper, we prove the correctness of the conjecture for Steiner trades, for [formula]. In other words we show that the conjecture is true for Steiner trades .

Some necessary results

The following results are useful in our discussion.

[\cite=khosro]. In every Steiner t-trade T = {T1,T2} with k  =  t + 1, volume s and for every x∈found(T), we have [formula].

[\cite=khosro]. Let T = {T1,T2} be a Steiner t-(v,k) trade with k > t + 1 and of volume s, then s  ≥  (t - 1)2t + 2.

Main result

In this section we investigate the main theorem in two cases: k = t + 1 and k > t + 1. Note that as a result of Theorem [\ref=c2] , it follows that for t = 2, we have [formula] and for t > 2, we have s  ≥  2t + 1 + 2. Therefore Theorem [\ref=c2] establishes the truth of the Conjecture for any Steiner trade with k > t + 1. Therefore the case k = t + 1 remains to prove, which we discuss it in the following Theorem.

. For t  ≥  3, there does not exist any Steiner t-(v,t + 1) trade of volume s such that [formula].

Induction on i. For i = 0, this is true by Theorem A. Suppose that the theorem is correct for values smaller than i (i > 1) and we have to establish it for i. Now induction on t. The minimum possible value on t is equal to i + 2. First we show, the nonexistence of these t-trades. If t = i + 2, then s = 2t + 1 - 3. Suppose that the statement is not correct and there exists a Steiner t-(v,t + 1) trade T of volume s = 2t + 1 - 3 and |found(T)| = f. Then we derive a contradiction. Consider x∈ found(T), since DxT is a Steiner (t - 1)-trade with k = t and volume s = rx, therefore rx  ≥  2t - 1. On the other hand by Lemma 2.1, we have [formula]. [formula]. Therefore 2t - 1  ≤  rx  ≤  2t - 2. But by induction assumption, only values remain to be checked are: [formula]. Case A.1: there exists x∈ found(T) such that rx = 2t - 1 then, (a) suppose that there exists y∈ found(T) such that λxy = 0. this leads to a contradiction. To see this we look at T - (Tx + Ty) which is a (t - 1)-(v,k') trade of volume [formula] [formula]; [formula]. If k' > t, by Theorem 2.1 is impossible. If k' = t since [formula] is odd and by induction assumption, [formula] can not take a possible value. (b) suppose that for every y∈ found(T), y  ≠  x , we have λxy  ≠  0 then |found(Tx)| = |found(T)| = f. Now, since Tx is a (t - 1)-trade with k = t + 1 and volume rx = 2t - 1 such that x appears in all its blocks. Must be of the form

[formula]

We note that f = 2t + 1. This is a contradiction since in T we have

f  ≥  k + t + 1 = 2t + 2.

Case A.2: for every x∈ found(T): rx  ≥  2t - 2t - 2. (a) again suppose that there exists y∈ found(T);  y  ≠  x such that λxy = 0. Then the volume [formula] of the (t - 1)-trade T - (Tx + Ty) is: [formula]. With considering the values rx and ry we have

[formula]

since minimum volume from (t - 1)-trade is 2t - 1 it is a contradiction. (b) now for every x,y∈ found(T) we have [formula] Therefore: if [formula]; [formula] i: [formula] found[formula]. In this case volume (t - 1)-trade T - (Tx + Ty) is: [formula]

[formula].

Since [formula] is odd and by induction assumption, [formula] can not take a possible value. ii: [formula] found(T), λxy = 2t - 1 - 2t - u - 1. In this case to reach a contradiction, counting the pairs (y,B);y∈B∈(DxT) in two ways we obtain

[formula]

Since |found(DxT)| = f - 1, therefore

(f - 1)(2t - 1 - 2t - u - 1) = t(2t + 2t - u) ⇒  f = 2t + 1,

and this is in contradiction with f  ≥  k + t + 1 = 2t + 2.

Now suppose by induction assumption that the theorem is correct for values smaller than t(t > i + 2) and we show it for t. Suppose that the statement is not correct and there exists a Steiner t-(v,t + 1) trade T of volume [formula] where 0 < j < 2t - 1 - i. Then we derive a contradiction. Consider x∈ found(T). Since DxT is a Steiner (t - 1)-trade with k = t and volume s = rx, therefore rx  ≥  2t - 1 and on the other hand we have [formula]. Now by induction assumption: rx = 2t - 2t - u where [formula] Case B.1: there exists x∈ found(T) such that rx = 2t - 1 then (a) suppose that there exists y∈ found(T) such that λxy = 0. For (t - 1)-trade T - (Tx + Ty)

[formula]

[formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] In the first case according to induction assumption for (i - 1), there does not exist any (t - 1)-trade of this volume. In the second case according to induction assumption for i = 0 there does not exist any (t - 1)-trade of this volume. And ultimately the last case is in contradiction with minimum volume from (t - 1)-trade. (b) suppose that for every y∈ found(T), y  ≠  x we have λxy  ≠  0. The non-existence of T can be proved the same way as in the case t = i + 2. Case B.2: for every x∈ found(T) rx  ≥  2t - 2t - 2. (a) Again suppose that there exists y∈ found(T); y  ≠  x such that λxy = 0. For (t - 1)-trade T - (Tx + Ty) [formula] where [formula] [formula] by assumption 0 < j < 2t - i - 1 we have [formula] which this is in contradiction with minimum volume from (t - 1)-trade. (b) now for every x,y∈ found(T), rx  ≤  ry we have [formula] if rx = 2t - 2t - u, [formula] [formula] [formula]. i: [formula] found(T),  [formula]. In this case for (t - 1)-trade T - (Tx + Ty) have:

[formula] where [formula]; [formula]; [formula].

Therefore [formula] we have four cases: 1) [formula] [formula]. [formula] 2) [formula] [formula]. [formula] [formula] 3) [formula] [formula]. [formula] [formula] 4) [formula] [formula]. [formula] [formula]

All of the above cases are in contradiction with induction assumption. ii: [formula] found(T),  λxy = 2t - 1 - 2t - u - 1. In this case the non-existence of T can be proved the same way as in the case t = i + 2 (Case A.2(b)ii).

Remark: In this sequel we improved the conjecture for Steiner trade. It remained for interested reader to prove the correctness of this conjecture for any trade. Acknowledgement: The authors thank the referees who helped us to improve presentation of this manuscript.
