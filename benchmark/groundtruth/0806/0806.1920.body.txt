Analogue of Sylvester-Cayley formula for invariants of ternary form

1. Let Td be the vector [formula]-space of ternary forms of degree d:

[formula]

where [formula] The vector space Td is endowed with the natural action of the group [formula] and with the corresponding action of the Lie algebra [formula] Let us identify the algebra of polynomial function [formula] with the polynomial [formula]-algebra Ad of the variables [formula] The natural action of the group [formula] on Td induces actions of [formula] and [formula] on the algebra Ad. The corresponding invariant ring [formula] is called the ring of invariants for the ternary form of degree d.

The ring ASL3d is graded ring

[formula]

here (ASL3d)n is the vector space generated by homogeneous invariants of degree n. In this paper we discover the exact formula for calculation the dimension of the vector space (RSL3d)n. The formula is analogue of well-known Sylvester-Cayley formula for invariants of binary form

2. To begin with, we give a short proof of Sylvester-Cayley fo invariants of binary form. We will use the idea of the proof in next section to derive an analogous result in the case of ternary form.

Let [formula] be standard two-dimensional representation of Lie algebra [formula] The irreducible representation Vd  =  〈v0,v1,...,vd〉, dim Vd = d + 1 is the symmetric d-power of the standard representation V = V1, i.e. Vd = Sd(V), [formula] The basis elements [formula] [formula], [formula] of the algebra [formula] act on Vd by the derivations :

[formula]

The action of [formula] is extended to action on the symmetrical algebra S(Vd) in the natural way. The algebra Id

[formula]

is called the algebra of invariant of the "binary form" of degree d.

The algebra S(Vd) is graded

[formula]

and each Sn(Vd) is complete reducibly respresentation of the Lie algebra [formula] Thus, the following decomposition is hold

[formula]

here γd(n,i) is the multiplicities of the representation Vi in the decomposition of Sn(Vd). In particular, the multiplicities γd(n,0) of trivial respresentation V0 is equal to number of linearly independed homogeneous invariants of degree n for the binary form of degree d.

The set of weights (the eigenvalues of the operator E) of a representatin W denote by ΛW, in particular, [formula]

The formal sum

[formula]

is called the character of the respresentation W, here nW(i) denotes the multiplicities of the weight i∈ΛW. Since, the multiplicities of any weight of the irreducible respresentation Vd is equal to 1, we have

[formula]

The character Char(Sn(Vd)) of the representation Sn(Vd) is equal to ����� [formula] see [\cite=FH], where [formula] is the complete symmetrical function

[formula]

see [\cite=Mc] for details.

By putting xi = pd - 2  i, [formula] we obtain the expression for the character of Char(Sn(Vd)):

[formula]

[formula]

here ωd(n,i) is the number nonnegative integer solutions of the equation

[formula]

on the assumption that |α| = n. In particular, the coefficient of q0 (the multiplicities of zero weight ) is equal to [formula] and the coefficient of q2 is equal [formula]

On the other hand, the decomposition ( * ) implies the equality

[formula]

Now we can prove

The zero weight occurs once in any irreducible representation Vi, [formula] therefore

[formula]

The weight 2 occurs once in any irreducible representation (except trivial) Vi, [formula] therefore

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

This completes the proof.

One may show, see [\cite=Hilb], that

[formula]

here [formula] is the q-binomial coefficient:

[formula]

3. In the Lie algebra [formula] denote by Ei  j the matrix unities.The matrix� H1: = E1  1  -  E2  2 and H2: = E2  2  -  E3  3 generate the Cartan subalgebra in [formula]The elements H1,H2 act on the Ad, see [\cite=A] for the proof, in the following way

[formula]

Every monomial [formula] of degree n is the eigenvector of the operators H1, H2 with the eigenvalues n  d - (2ω1(α) + ω2(α)) and ω1(α) - ω2(α) correspondingly. Here [formula] [formula] [formula]

Denote by Γm1,  m2 the standard irreducible representation of [formula] with the highest weight λ = (m1,m2). It can easily be checked that [formula] [formula] see details in [\cite=FH].

Let us recall the definition of the formal character of the representation of the Lie algebra [formula]. Let Λ be a weight lattice of all finitedimension representation of [formula] and [formula] be their group ring. The ring [formula] is free [formula]-module with the basis elements e(λ), λ = (λ1,λ2)∈Λ, e(λ)e(μ) = e(λ  +  μ), e(0) = 1. Let Λλ be set of all weights of the representation Γλ. Then the formal character Char(Γλ) is defined, see [\cite=Hum], as formal sum [formula] here nλ(μ) is the multiplicities of the weight μ in the representation Γλ. For example, for the highest weight λ = (1,1) we have

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

The basis elements ai,j of the ring Ad have weights (d - (2  i + j),i - j), i + j  ≤  d, of the the multiplicities 1, thus

[formula]

The characted of the symmetric power Sn(Γd,  0) is the complete symmetric polynomial of degree n of the variable set e(d - (2  i + j),i - j), i + j  ≤  d, see [\cite=FH]. Therefore we have

[formula]

After simplification we obtain

[formula]

here cd(n,i,j) is the number of nonnegative integer solutions of the system of equations

[formula]

or the equivalent system

[formula]

For i = j = 0 we get ω1(α) = ω2(α) and n  d = 3ω1(α). It implies n  d  =  0 mod 3. By adding first two equations we obtain i - j = 0 mod 3. It implies i + 2  j = 0 mod 3.

On the representation Γλ let us define the value Eλ in the following way

[formula]

We assume that nλ(i,j) = 0 if (i,j)∉Λλ.

The following theorem play crucial role in the calculation.

For λ = (0,0) the statement is obvious.

Suppose now λ  ≠  (0,0). Let us recall that the weight multiplicities of Γ(i,j) increase by one on each of the concentric hexagons of the eigenvalue lattice and are constant on the internal triangles. To prove the theorem let us consider the cases - i - j = 0, |i - j| > 3 and |i - j| = 3.

Let λ = (m,m), m > 0. Then nλ(0,0) = m + 1, and it is clear that nλ(1,1) = m and nλ(3,0) = nλ(2,2) = nλ(0,3) = m - 1. It follows that

[formula]

Let λ = (m,k), |m - k| > 3. Then all multiplicities nλ(0,0), nλ(3,0), nλ(1,1), nλ(2,2), nλ(0,3) are equal to min (m,k) + 1 and therefore Eλ = 0.

Let λ = (m,k), m - k = 3. Then nλ(0,0) = nλ(3,0) = nλ(1,1) = k + 1 and nλ(2,2)  =  k, nλ(0,3) = k, ����� Eλ = 0.

If λ = (m,k), k - m = 3 then nλ(0,0) = nλ(0,3) = nλ(1,1) = m + 1 and nλ(2,2) = m, nλ(3,0) = m. This yields that Eλ = 0.

Now we are ready to calculate the value νd(n).

The number νd(n) is equal to the multiplicities γd(0,0) of trivial representation Γ0,0 in the symmetrical power Sn(Γ0,  d). Suppose the decomposition is hold

[formula]

It is implies,

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

It follows that [formula] By using previous theorem we have

[formula]

Taking into account γd(0,0) = νd(n) we obtain the statement of the theorem.

4. Let us derive the fourmula for calculation of νd(n).

It is not hard to prove that the number cd(n,0,0) of nonnegative integer solutions of the following system

[formula]

is equal to coefficient of [formula] the expansion of the following series

[formula]

Denote it in such way - [formula]

The number cd(n,3,0) of nonnegative integer solutions of the following system

[formula]

is equal to [formula] Similarly,

[formula]

Therefore the following formula is hold

[formula]

Let us define the pq-binomial coefficients in the following way

[formula]

The function [formula] are generating functions for the pq-binomial coefficients:

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Thus, the number νd(n) of linearly independed homogeneous invariants of degree n for the ternary form of degree d is calculating by the formula

[formula]

Below are present the first several terms of Poincaré series for the rings of invariants of the ternary forms of degrees 3,4,5,6,7.

[formula]

The results in the case d = 4 coincides completelly with the results of Shioda, see [\cite=Shi].
