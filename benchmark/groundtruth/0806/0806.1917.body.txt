The Kohn Algorithm on Denjoy-Carleman classes

Introduction

The systematic study of the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem on pseudoconvex domains in [formula] was initiated by Joseph J. Kohn in his paper [\cite=kohnacta] published in Acta Mathematica in 1979. Kohn defined subelliptic multipliers for the [formula]-Neumann problem and showed they formed a multiplier ideal sheaf. Kohn was the first to construct a multiplier ideal sheaf, which has become since a standard object in algebraic geometry. Kohn defined his subelliptic multipliers to be germs of [formula] functions and wrote down an algorithm that generates an increasing chain of ideals of multipliers, whose termination at the whole ring implies the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem. This termination condition is called Kohn finite ideal type. In the same paper [\cite=kohnacta], Joseph J. Kohn proved a three-way equivalence for pseudoconvex domains in [formula] with real-analytic [formula] boundary, namely that the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem on (p,q) forms is equivalent to Kohn finite ideal type for (p,q) forms and is also equivalent to the condition that holomorphic varieties of complex dimension q have finite order of contact with the boundary of the domain. The latter condition is called finite D'Angelo type after John D'Angelo who investigated its properties in detail in [\cite=opendangelo] and proved the crucial fact that it is an open condition.

The next important development in the investigation of the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem came in the mid 1980's with a series of three deep papers by David Catlin, [\cite=catlinnec], [\cite=catlinbdry], and [\cite=catlinsubell], in which he proved the equivalence of two out of the three properties that appear in Kohn's theorem for real-analytic domains, namely that for a smooth, pseudoconvex domain in [formula] the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem is equivalent to finite D'Angelo type. Catlin's construction uses some of the subelliptic multipliers defined by Kohn but does not investigate whether the Kohn algorithm terminates, i.e. whether Kohn finite ideal type is also equivalent to the other two properties for smooth, pseudoconvex domains in [formula] This three-way equivalence has been posited by Joseph J. Kohn and David Catlin and is called the Kohn conjecture.

The current investigation of the equivalence of types for Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes is an intermediate case between the [formula] one settled by Kohn in 1979 and the Kohn conjecture. It involves classes of functions without necessarily convergent Taylor expansions that still satisfy the Lojasiewicz inequalities, properties crucial to the equivalence of types.

The Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes are local subrings of the ring of smooth functions that satisfy certain bounds on their derivatives of various orders. The sequence of bounds behaves according to the Denjoy-Carleman Theorem, which means that the Taylor morphism is injective on any such Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class, i.e. there are no flat functions contained therein. Each Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class we will consider contains all real-analytic functions but is strictly larger, so it also contains functions with non-convergent Taylor expansions. The property that makes these Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes both peculiar and highly interesting is that they fail to satisfy the Weierstrass Division Property as Childress proved in [\cite=childress]. With one additional assumption on the sequence of bounds, each such Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class is closed under differentiation and therefore also closed under composition, division by a coordinate, and inverse. Edward Bierstone and Pierre Milman were thus able to extend in [\cite=bm] the resolution of singularities algorithm to all Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes satisfying this additional assumption. Their construction implies that all three Lojasiewicz inequalities hold. In addition, they proved topological Noetherianity, a weaker condition than Noetherianity but of great use for the equivalence of types considered here.

We shall show in this paper that for a pseudoconvex domain in [formula] with boundary in any such Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class, all multipliers generated by the Kohn algorithm stay in the same Denjoy-Carleman class and the three-way equivalence proved by Kohn for pseudoconvex [formula] domains extends to this case:

Let Ω in [formula] be a pseudoconvex domain with boundary in a Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class [formula] defined in a neighborhood of [formula] where the sequence of bounds M is such that [formula] is closed under differentiation. Let x0∈bΩ be any point on the boundary of the domain, and let Ux0 be an appropriately small neighborhood around x0. The following three properties are equivalent:

The [formula]-Neumann problem for (p,q) forms is subelliptic on Ux0;

The Kohn algorithm on (p,q) forms terminates at x0 by generating the entire ring CM(Ux0);

The order of contact of holomorphic varieties of complex dimension q with the boundary of the domain Ω in Ux0 is finite.

As mentioned at the beginning of this introduction, the implication (ii) [formula] (i) was already done by Joseph J. Kohn for [formula] functions in [\cite=kohnacta], so his construction applies here as well. The implication (i) [formula] (iii) is the contrapositive of Catlin's Theorem 1 in [\cite=catlinnec]. We should add that a complex variety passing through x0 that has infinite order of contact with bΩ is already sitting inside bΩ since the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic functions considered here contain no flat functions. Thus, the aim of this paper is to prove the implication (iii) [formula] (ii). The proof that will be given is purely qualitative in nature. There is no attempt to compute an effective bound for the subelliptic gain in the [formula]-Neumann problem in terms of the D'Angelo type and the dimension. The focus is instead on the interaction of the algebraic properties of the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes with the algebra of the Kohn algorithm.

In very recent work that is being written up, the author and Liat Kessler showed Denjoy-Carleman classes are non-Noetherian rings. Nonetheless, the topological Noetherianity proven by Bierstone and Milman permits the construction of certain finitely-generated subideals of the ideals of multipliers via which it can shown that the ascending chain in the Kohn algorithm stabilizes. Likewise, the presence of Lojasiewicz inequalities enables a Nullstellensatz for a notion of real radical particular to the Kohn algorithm. Therefore, this construction provides a glimpse into the algebra necessary for the direct proof of the Kohn conjecture. The ideas of constructing subideals of the ideals of multipliers that have special properties and proving a Nullstellensatz via the Lojasiewicz inequalities are also prominent in the direct proof of the Kohn conjecture as the reader can easily see by comparing the set-up in [\cite=an] with this one. The intricacies of the smooth case, however, make it much harder for the reader to identify the crucial algebraic points, whereas the algebra is clear here, in spite of the non-Noetherianity of the ring.

In addition to the main result, Theorem [\ref=maintheorem], concerning the equivalence of types, we derive a very simple consequence of Bierstone's and Milman's work in [\cite=bm], namely that all the rings corresponding to Denjoy-Carleman classes closed under differentiation satisfy the [formula] condition for the real radical notion [formula] In commutative algebra, this condition is the nicest a non-Noetherian ring can satisfy. The reader may consult [\cite=op] and [\cite=kaplansky] for additional information on this type of rings. In the light of the author's result with Liat Kessler on the non-Noetherianity of the Denjoy-Carleman classes, this result would be optimal, except for having to restrict to the neighborhood of a compact set.

Theorem

The paper is organized as follows: Section [\ref=DCdescription] introduces the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes and outlines a number of their properties. At the end of this section, Theorem [\ref=radaccprop] is proven. Section [\ref=subkohnalg] recalls the Kohn algorithm and other matters related to the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem. Finally, the equivalence of types, Theorem [\ref=maintheorem], is proven in Section [\ref=equivtypepf].

The author would like to thank Edward Bierstone and Pierre Milman for introducing her to their work on the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes and related literature as well as for very kindly taking the time to answer numerous questions on the properties of these classes. Additionally, the author would like to thank Fabrizio Broglia for a couple of astute algebraic observations that have led to important clarifications in the current manuscript.

The Denjoy-Carleman Quasianalytic Classes

We shall follow here the set-up of the Bierstone and Milman paper [\cite=bm], but the reader is also directed to Vincent Thilliez's expository paper [\cite=thilliez] for the properties of more general quasianalytic local rings.

We start with the definition of a quasianalytic class. Let us make the identification [formula] where [formula]

Since the [formula]-Neumann problem is posed on (p,q) forms in [formula] we must also introduce another class CM(U) of [formula]-valued quasianalytic functions. We will examine the properties of both classes [formula] and CM(U), going back and forth between them as necessary.

Definition

Remarks:

(1) Clearly,

[formula]

and

[formula]

(2) Consider any open set Ũ  ⊂  U. If f∈CM(U), then it is obvious from Definition [\ref=Cquasiandef] that the restriction [formula] The same holds for [formula] We shall use this fact extensively.

In order to ensure that [formula] is a local ring, which is essential for the algebraic considerations that will follow, we must make an additional assumption on the sequence M of bounds. The interested reader should consult [\cite=thilliez] for more information on this assumption and its implications.

Definition

One of the consequences of Definition [\ref=logconvexdef] along with the assumption that M0 = 1 is that [formula] is an increasing sequence of positive real numbers greater than or equal to 1. Since real-analytic functions satisfy estimate  [\eqref=realquasianest] with M|α| = 1 for all α, it follows that [formula] contains all [formula]-valued real-analytic functions and CM(U) contains all [formula]-valued real-analytic functions. In fact, Corollary 1 of Theorem 1 in [\cite=thilliez] gives a condition on M equivalent to having that [formula] is exactly the ring of [formula]-valued real-analytic functions on U, [formula]

Proposition

Given that the sequence [formula] is increasing, this proposition implies that we must assume

[formula]

in order to guarantee that both [formula] and CM(U) are strictly larger than the rings of [formula]-valued real-analytic functions and [formula]-valued real-analytic functions respectively.

Émile Borel was the first to give examples of quasianalytic functions that were not also real-analytic in two papers [\cite=borel1] and [\cite=borel2]. The reader should consult either these two papers of Borel or [\cite=thilliez] for such examples. This work by Borel led Jacques Hadamard to pose the question in 1912 as to whether there exists a condition on the sequence M that ensures the quasianalyticity of the corresponding class. The answer to Hadamard's question is the Denjoy-Carleman Theorem:

Denjoy-Carleman Theorem

Such a class [formula] or CM(U) satisfying the Denjoy-Carleman Theorem is called a Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class. We have just one more condition to impose on M, and we will have described completely the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic classes on which we will consider the equivalence of types. This condition guarantees that both [formula] and CM(U) are closed under differentiation. The result is originally due to Szolem Mandelbrojt and can be found as Corollary 2 to Theorem 1 of [\cite=thilliez]:

Proposition

Remark: Clearly, [formula] closed under differentiation implies CM(U) is also closed under differentiation.

We shall summarize now the results of Section 4 of [\cite=bm] in a proposition that lists all the properties of a Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class of the type described above that enable the resolution of singularities. This result is only stated for [formula] because some of the properties contained therein are awkward to give in complex coordinates.

Proposition

Remarks:

(1) Proposition [\ref=allpropsthere] part (v) is equivalent to the Implicit Function Theorem, which can be stated in this context as follows: Let U be an open subset of [formula] with product coordinates [formula] Let [formula] (a,b)∈U, [formula] and [formula] be invertible, then there exists a product neighborhood V  ×  W of (a,b) in U and a mapping [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  2p, g(a) = b, and f(x,g(x)) = 0 for all x∈V.

(2) Proposition [\ref=allpropsthere] part (v) implies that [formula] is closed under reciprocal, i.e. if [formula] is such that f(x)  ≠  0 for all x∈U, then [formula]

(3) Using the properties of [formula] in Proposition [\ref=allpropsthere], we can construct manifolds of class [formula] as well as functions on such manifolds. Since real and imaginary parts of functions in CM(U) are in [formula] we automatically also get well-defined manifolds of class CM(U) as well as functions on those manifolds.

As it will be seen in Section [\ref=subkohnalg], the Kohn algorithm yields an increasing chain of ideals of functions defined on the boundary of the domain [formula] We thus have to explore here what it means to have germs of functions in the class CM(U) defined on a manifold of the same class as well as sheaves of ideals in this class of functions. Let X be a manifold of class CM(U) such that [formula] Since X is embedded in [formula] we equip it with the subset topology, where [formula] has the standard Euclidean metric topology on it. Let [formula] be the set of germs of functions in CM(U) defined at points of X. We consider a sheaf of ideals [formula] and we would like to define what it means for [formula] to be of finite type.

Definition

We will work with ideals of finite type [formula] and with the affine varieties [formula] corresponding to such ideals. In this language, an ideal of finite type [formula] is a subsheaf on some open set Ũ  ⊂  U such that [formula] is open in the topology of X and for every [formula] the stalk at b is generated by the germs of [formula] at b and [formula] A particularly simple case occurs when Ũ  =  X, so [formula] is an ideal in the ring CM(Ũ). For a manifold X of class [formula] with germs [formula] on it, the definition of an ideal of finite type is the same as in the case of CM(U).

We can now state two of the consequences of applying resolution of singularities to the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class [formula] which Edward Bierstone and Pierre Milman obtained in [\cite=bm]. We shall state as corollaries in both instances the corresponding results for CM(U), which are the ones we are interested in here. Both of these are crucial for the equivalence of types on domains of class CM(U). The first of these important consequences is topological Noetherianity, which is Theorem 6.1 of [\cite=bm], stated here in a less general way that is more suited to our purposes.

Theorem (Topological Noetherianity)

To any ideal [formula] can be associated an ideal [formula] defined by

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] is of finite type if [formula] is and [formula] We thus obtain:

Corollary

The second of the important consequences of Edward Bierstone's and Pierre Milman's work is the full set of Lojasiewicz inequalities for the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class [formula] Theorem 6.3 of [\cite=bm].

Theorem

Since the real and imaginary parts of elements in CM(U) are in [formula] it is clear that parts (I) and (II) will also be true on CM(U). Part (III) is irrelevant for type equivalence, so we will not restate it for CM(U).

Corollary

Proof: Part (II) follows from part (I) by setting g(x) = d(x,Z). To prove part (I), we look at g21 + g22 and compare it to f21 + f22, where f = f1 + if2 and g = g1 + ig2 for [formula] Clearly, [formula] and [formula] so [formula] By part (I) of Theorem [\ref=rlojasiewicz], we conclude that in a neighborhood of any set K compact in the topology of X there exist C,α > 0 with [formula] such that

[formula]

for all x in a neighborhood of K. This is equivalent to

[formula]

We conclude that

[formula]

must hold with [formula]

We shall close this section with three important results for the equivalence of types on domains of class CM(U) that follow from Corollaries [\ref=topnoetherianity] and  [\ref=lojasiewicz] as well as the proof of Theorem [\ref=radaccprop]. I am indebted to [\cite=pieroni] for the observation contained in the first of these:

Proposition

Proof: This proposition is a consequence of topological Noetherianity. If [formula] is the zero ideal, there is nothing to prove, so we assume [formula] This means there exists some [formula] such that [formula] in a neighborhood of K. Let [formula] be the ideal generated by f1. If [formula] in a neighborhood of K, we are done; otherwise, there exists [formula] [formula] in a neighborhood of K such that [formula] Set [formula] [formula] is clearly of finite type. Inductively, given [formula] a subideal of finite type of [formula] either [formula] in a neighborhood of K or there exists [formula] in a neighborhood of K such that [formula] but [formula] Set [formula] We have thus constructed an increasing sequence of subideals of [formula] of finite type [formula] Consider now the decreasing sequence of the corresponding affine varieties [formula] By Corollary [\ref=topnoetherianity], there exists some k such that in a neighborhood of K, [formula] for all j  ≥  k. Set [formula] which is clearly a subideal of [formula] of finite type such that [formula] in a neighborhood of K.

The previous result and the Lojasiewicz inequalities, Corollary [\ref=lojasiewicz] imply a Lojasiewicz type Nullstellensatz. Before we can state this Nullstellensatz, we have to specify which notion of radical we will employ:

Definition

Remarks:

(1) As notation indicates, the power mK and the function fK may depend on the compact set K.

(2) The object in Definition [\ref=realrad] is indeed an ideal. Closure under multiplication follows from the fact that for each h∈CM(U) and any compact subset K of U, there exists some CK  =   max x∈K|h(x)|. We restate the estimate for g as [formula] noting that [formula] so [formula] To check closure under addition, we restate the estimates for some [formula] as [formula] and [formula] on K. It follows

[formula]

We then choose natural numbers n1 and n2 such that [formula] and [formula] and raise both sides of the previous estimate to the power 2n1n2 to obtain

[formula]

for an appropriately large M. Note now that the right hand side of the estimate is a function in CM(U) as needed.

Theorem (Lojasiewicz Nullstellensatz)

Proof: The inclusion

[formula]

is clear. We only have to prove the reverse inclusion. Consider any [formula] and set [formula] g∈CM(Ũ) since [formula] Since

[formula]

for any compact subset K of Ũ and UK an open neighborhood of K in Ũ, we apply part (I) of Corollary [\ref=lojasiewicz] to conclude that there exist C,α > 0 such that

[formula]

for all x∈UK with α rational. This precisely means that [formula] as needed.

We now have to use the Lojasiewicz inequalities to deduce that the affine variety corresponding to any ideal [formula] in a Denjoy-Carleman quasianalytic class, which is a ring, must have an open and dense set of smooth points. First, let us define a smooth point:

Definition

Remarks:

(1) The definition implies that the set of smooth points of a variety [formula] is open.

(2) Each element in CM(U) is a function of [formula] or its conjugate [formula] and if f vanishes on [formula] then so must . This justifies giving the Jacobian restatement of what it means for [formula] to be a submanifold in terms of complex gradients only without any mention of their conjugates because [formula]

For the ring of holomorphic functions [formula] and for the ring of [formula]-valued real-analytic functions [formula] it is known that any affine variety has an open and dense set of smooth points. For the ring of smooth functions [formula] this same statement is not always true but was proven by René Thom in [\cite=thom] for [formula] under the hypothesis that the ideal [formula] is Lojasiewicz. An ideal [formula] is called Lojasiewicz if it is of finite type and its generators satisfy the Lojasiewicz inequality with respect to distance, which is the content of part (II) of Corollary [\ref=lojasiewicz] for all elements of the ring CM(U). Given any ideal [formula] Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop] guarantees that [formula] can be presented in a neighborhood of a compact set as the variety [formula] corresponding to a subideal [formula] of [formula] of finite type. This result combined with part (II) of Corollary [\ref=lojasiewicz] leads us to expect that indeed any affine variety corresponding to an ideal in CM(U) must have an open and dense set of smooth points:

Proposition

Proof: We know the set of smooth points of [formula] is open, so we only have to show that it is dense. For any [formula] the set {x0} is compact in the topology chosen for X, so we set K  =  {x0} and apply Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop] to conclude that there exists a neighborhood U' of x0, U'  ⊂  Ũ, as well as a subideal of finite type [formula] such that [formula] on U'. Set [formula] f∈CM(Ũ) since [formula] It is obvious that [formula] By part (II) of Corollary [\ref=lojasiewicz], the Lojasiewicz inequality with respect to distance holds for f on U', so the proof of Rene Thom in [\cite=thom] or the even simpler proof of the same result given by Jean-Claude Tougeron in [\cite=tougeron] (proof of Proposition 4.6 in subsection V.4) apply verbatim.

Remark: Thom's theorem does not apply directly to this case because we are considering here an ideal [formula] of elements in the ring CM(U') and not in the ring [formula]

Finally, we can prove Theorem [\ref=radaccprop]:

Proof of Theorem [\ref=radaccprop]: Let [formula] be an increasing chain of ideals. For any compact subset K of U, let UK be an open neighborhood of K in U. Consider the increasing chain of ideals [formula] where the real radical is computed on UK. By Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop] with X = U, we know that there exists a subideal of finite type [formula] such that [formula] for each j  ≥  1. We apply next the Lojasiewicz Nullstellensatz, Proposition [\ref=nullstellensatz], to conclude that [formula] where the real radical of [formula] is computed on UK for all j  ≥  1 and both [formula] and [formula] are ideals in CM(UK). Note that we needed a finitely generated ideal in order to be able to apply the Nullstellensatz. By Topological Noetherianity, Corollary [\ref=topnoetherianity], the decreasing chain of varieties

[formula]

stabilizes, namely there exists some [formula] such that for all j  ≥  k, [formula] once again on UK. The largest ideal of functions, however, that vanishes on [formula] on UK is [formula] We know [formula] so from the application of the Nullstellensatz above, we conclude [formula] so [formula] stabilizes.

Remarks:

(1) The hypothesis that U be connected comes from the definition of CM(U), Definition [\ref=Cquasiandef].

(2) Even though our definitions have been given just for U in [formula] it is clear everything goes through if U is a subset of [formula]

(3) It might be possible to strengthen Theorem [\ref=radaccprop] to say [formula] stabilizes on all of U provided the following technical point can be bypassed: By employing an exhaustion by compact subsets [formula] such that [formula] it is easily seen that for any ideal [formula] in CM(U), there exist at most countably many functions [formula] such that [formula] For the proof of Theorem [\ref=radaccprop] to go through for [formula] on all of U, it would be necessary to combine such a sequence [formula] into just one function f∈CM(U) that could act as the sum of squares function g in the proof of the Lojasiewicz Nullstellensatz, Proposition [\ref=nullstellensatz]. In other words, the fact that our Nullstellensatz is restricted to ideals of finite type is the chief obstruction here. Definition [\ref=Cquasiandef] only gives bounds on compact subsets of U for functions in CM(U), whereas a bound that works on all of U would be needed to combine the sequence [formula] into just one function using a geometric series trick.

Subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann Problem and the Kohn Algorithm

We shall give here only a brief outline of the properties of subelliptic multipliers and the Kohn algorithm. The interested reader should consult Joseph J. Kohn's paper [\cite=kohnacta] for the set-up of the [formula]-Neumann problem as well as the proofs of the results cited in this section. We first give Kohn's characterization of subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem on (p,q) forms:

The non-ellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem is coming precisely from the boundary condition given by [formula] If the point x0 is inside the domain Ω then automatically estimate [\ref=subellestproblem] holds at x0 with the largest possible ε allowed by the [formula]-Neumann problem, namely ε  =  1. The problem is thus elliptic rather than subelliptic inside as it was proven by Kohn in [\cite=dbneumann1] and [\cite=dbneumann2] for strongly pseudoconvex domains as well as by Hörmander in [\cite=hormest] and Kohn in [\cite=kohnweakpsc] via weighted estimates for pseudoconvex domains. This implies subellipticity only needs to be studied on the boundary of the domain bΩ.

We shall now give Kohn's definition of a subelliptic multiplier:

Definition

The notation Iq(x0) for subelliptic multipliers at x0 for (p,q) forms drops reference to p, the holomorphic part of such forms, which is irrelevant in the [formula]-Neumann problem.

Remarks:

(1) If there exists a subelliptic multiplier f∈Iq(x0) such that f(x0)  ≠  0, then a subelliptic estimate holds at x0 for the [formula]-Neumann problem.

(2) If x0∈bΩ but f  =  0 on [formula] then estimate [\eqref=subellest] holds for ε  =  1, which is the largest possible value. This is the case if we set f  =  r, where r is the defining function of the domain Ω.

(3) If x0∈bΩ, the highest possibly gain in regularity in the [formula]-Neumann problem given by ε in estimate [\eqref=subellestproblem] is [formula] under the strongest convexity assumption, namely strong pseudoconvexity of Ω, as proved by Kohn in [\cite=dbneumann1] and [\cite=dbneumann2].

(4) The reader should note that Definition [\ref=subellmultdef] yields a sheaf of germs of subelliptic multipliers, which is precisely what is needed to capture the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem.

Kohn's Theorem 1.21 in [\cite=kohnacta] encapsulates the properties of subelliptic multipliers he proved in his paper. These motivate the way he sets up his algorithm, which determines whether or not the [formula]-Neumann problem is subelliptic:

Theorem

The Kohn Algorithm:

Step 1

Step (k+1)

where

[formula]

for [formula] and j  ≤  n - q. Note that (    ·    ) stands for the ideal generated by the functions inside the parentheses and [formula] is the determinant of the Levi form for q = 1, namely in the [formula]-Neumann problem for (0,1) forms. Evidently, Iqk(x0)  ⊂  Iq(x0) at each step k, and furthermore the algorithm generates an increasing chain of ideals

[formula]

We will employ the following notation pertaining to the varieties corresponding to ideals of multipliers just as Kohn does in [\cite=kohnacta]:

[formula]

We will now recall from [\cite=kohnacta] the definition of the Zariski tangent space to an ideal and to a variety, which are crucial in testing the progress of the Kohn algorithm. We will state everything in terms of ideals in the ring CM(U), which is the underlying ring in our construction. U is to be specified later.

Definition

The next lemma is Lemma 6.10 of [\cite=kohnacta] that relates [formula] with [formula]

Lemma

We define

[formula]

which is the subspace of T  1,0x(bΩ) consisting of the directions in which the Levi form vanishes. With this notation, we can define the holomorphic dimension of a variety lying in the boundary of the domain Ω.

Definition

We conclude this section with Proposition 6.12 of [\cite=kohnacta] that explores the implications of the Kohn algorithm not advancing at a particular point of [formula]

Proposition

Equivalence of Types

We start by showing that the Kohn algorithm on a domain whose defining function is in CM(U) for [formula] only produces germs of Denjoy-Carleman functions in the same class.

Proof: Let r be the defining function of Ω. The hypothesis says that r∈CM(U). As seen in Section [\ref=subkohnalg], the Kohn algorithm involves only differentiations, taking of real radicals, addition, and multiplication starting with r. Addition and multiplication appear not only in the generation of various ideals but also in the computation of all Jacobians involved. CM(U) is a ring, hence closed under addition and multiplication, and also closed under differentiation by assumption. Finally, by definition the real radical of an ideal [formula] stays in the same ring in which [formula] lies.

Convention: Since the two elements r and [formula] that start the Kohn algorithm are global, i.e. defined on the closure of the whole domain, it is possible to run a modification of the Kohn algorithm on a neighborhood Ux0 of x0 that is small enough that the following are satisfied:

For every [formula] the boundary bΩ has finite D'Angelo type at x. As mentioned in the introduction, D'Angelo type is an open condition, and we are assuming it holds at x0.

Ux0 is small enough that Topological Noetherianity (Corollary [\ref=topnoetherianity]), the representation of a variety by finitely many elements (Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop]), and the Lojasiewicz Nullstellensatz (Theorem [\ref=nullstellensatz]) all hold on Ux0.

In the modified Kohn algorithm, ideals are in the ring CM(Ux0) and [formula] is computed on Ux0 in the sense of Definition [\ref=realrad]. It is clear that the termination of this modified algorithm implies the termination of the original Kohn algorithm on germs.

The Modified Kohn Algorithm:

Step 1

[formula]

Step (k+1)

[formula]

where

[formula]

for [formula] and j  ≤  n - q.

Next, we will show that the decreasing chain of varieties [formula] given by the modified Kohn algorithm stabilizes on Ux0:

Proposition

Proof: If we can represent [formula] as corresponding to an increasing sequence of subideals of finite type [formula] where [formula] for all k  ≥  1, then Corollary [\ref=topnoetherianity] implies the result. By Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop], there exists a subideal of finite type [formula] such that [formula] on Ux0. Given a subideal of finite type [formula] such that [formula] on Ux0, we would like to produce the next subideal [formula] We start with [formula] in the proof of Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop] instead of the zero ideal and keep adding elements of Iqs(Ux0) until [formula] on Ux0. Corollary [\ref=topnoetherianity] guarantees only finitely many elements of Iqs(Ux0) need to be added just as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop].

We now recall Theorem 3 proven by Eric Bedford and John Erik Fornæ ss in 1981 in [\cite=bf]. This theorem gives a generalization to [formula] boundaries of the Diederich-Fornæ ss theorem in [\cite=df] that provides the crucial geometrical step connecting the failure of the Kohn algorithm to generate the whole ring with the existence of a complex variety in the boundary of the domain:

Theorem

We are finally ready to tackle the proof of the equivalence of types.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]: As explained in the introduction, the implication (iii) [formula] (ii) is the only one that needs to be proved. We will prove the contrapositive statement that the failure of the Kohn algorithm to terminate at the whole ring, negation of (ii), implies the existence of a holomorphic variety in the boundary of the domain, negation of finite D'Angelo type (iii). Let x0∈bΩ be any point on the boundary of the domain, and let Ux0 be a neighborhood of x0 having the properties outlined after the proof of Theorem [\ref=allinsidethm]. By Proposition [\ref=chainstabilizes], there exists some natural number k such that [formula] for all j  ≥  k on Ux0. By Proposition [\ref=finitetypeprop], there exists a subideal of finite type [formula] such that [formula] on Ux0. We apply the Lojasiewicz Nullstellensatz, Theorem [\ref=nullstellensatz], to [formula] on Ux0 to conclude that [formula] Since [formula] and [formula] on Ux0, then

[formula]

By assumption, [formula] so [formula] As [formula] for all j  ≥  k, Proposition [\ref=stilltherethm], and Lemma [\ref=zariski] together imply that [formula] has holomorphic dimension at least q. By Proposition [\ref=smoothptsprop], [formula] has an open and dense set of smooth points. We choose such a smooth point y∈Ux0, which has a neighborhood Ũ  ⊂  Ux0 satisfying that [formula] is a manifold. Then Theorem [\ref=dfsmooththm] implies that there exists a complex manifold [formula] such that [formula] This contradicts condition (iii), finite D'Angelo type at y. As the neighborhood Ux0 was chosen such that [formula] has finite D'Angelo type everywhere, this is the needed contradiction.
