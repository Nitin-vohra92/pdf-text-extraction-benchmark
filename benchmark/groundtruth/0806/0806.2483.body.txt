Localization-delocalization transition of a polaron near an impurity

A general approach to the theoretical description of a particle in a bulk medium coupled both to bosonic excitations and the potential of imperfections is an important but notoriously hard problem that poses a real challenge even to modern nonperturbative approaches [\cite=Olle03]. As yet only approximate results, relying, e.g., on dynamical-mean field theory exist. A central question in this context is the formation of three-dimensional (3D) polarons at impurities, or the Anderson localization of polarons in disordered media [\cite=DISPOL] [\cite=Bro] [\cite=AlKo]. The overall importance of the physics of electron-phonon interaction in doped materials makes this issue of general interest for different areas of physics and technology. As a matter of fact the interplay between disorder and interaction effects is an important issue for contemporary materials design. For example high temperature superconductors [\cite=Lee06] [\cite=Gun08] [\cite=Vit07_OCtJ08] or materials with colossal magnetoresistance [\cite=CMR] are doped Mott insulators where besides the coupling to bosonic excitations (phonons and magnons) disorder is present.

In this Letter we present the exact solution to the polaron problem in the presence of an attractive impurity in a 3D material. The accepted model for that situation is given by the Hamiltonian H = H(0)  +  H(1) with

[formula]

In H(0), U is the attractive impurity potential for the electron [formula] at site 0 and [formula] creates a dispersionless optical phonon with frequency [formula] at Wannier i. H(1) describes the electron transfer [formula] between nearest neighbor sites and local Holstein coupling to the phonons [formula].

In the absence of electron-phonon (el-ph) coupling (γ = 0), the critical U for particle localization at the impurity is Uc(γ = 0)  ≈  3.96 [\cite=KostSlet]; all energies are measured in units of t hereafter. In the adiabatic approximation (AA), setting [formula], the phase diagram in U - λ coordinates, with the dimensionless coupling constant [formula], was established in Ref. [\cite=ShiToy79]. The phase boundary in AA, separating delocalized polaron states from localized ones, crosses the U-axis at Uc(γ = 0) and the λ-axis at [formula]. The latter crossing is a confusing property of the AA phase diagram since it implies that for el-ph couplings [formula] the polaron is localized even when U = 0. Quite the contrary, a particle is never localized in a translationally invariant lattice (U = 0) with quantum phonons ([formula]). Instead the particle undergoes only a crossover from the weak-coupling light polaron to a strong-coupling heavy polaron with small radius around a self-trapping coupling [formula] [\cite=MPS_Rashba_Pekar]. The AA erroneously equates [formula] with the critical el-ph coupling strength λc required for polaron localization at U  ≠  0. Therefore drastic differences between the exact result and that obtained in AA are expected, especially at small Uc.

Having this delicate situation in mind, we decided to study the full Hamiltonian ([\ref=h0])-([\ref=int]) with quantum phonons. To this end we employ a new scheme combining the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DMC) method in direct space [\cite=MPSS] and the Stochastic Optimization Method for analytic continuation [\cite=MPSS] [\cite=Olle] which provides the approximation-free solution of the above problem without finite size errors and in zero temperature limit. Calculating the charge density distribution (CDD) around the impurity and the local density of states (LDOS) on the impurity site we establish the exact localization phase diagram for different phonon frequencies. We characterize two novel polaronic regimes in a system with impurities. The polaron at small U can be self-trapped though extended and not yet confined by shallow impurities. Another regime, arising near the critical parameters for localization at the impurity, shows spectroscopic response like a mixture of spectra typical for weak, intermediate, and strong coupling.

The direct space DMC method [\cite=Macridin2004] can provide the direct space Green functions (GFs) in imaginary time (τ) representation at zero temperature [formula] for the Hamiltonian ([\ref=h0]-[\ref=int]) by Feynman diagram expansion in the interaction representation

[formula]

The implementation of DMC [\cite=Macridin2004] requires to keep in computer memory all GFs [formula] in direct space, which restricts the lattice to about 25  ×  25 sites. To avoid this size limitation we calculate only quantities related to on-site GFs [formula]. With our implementation of DMC we are able to calculate the on-site GFs at zero temperature for a 108  ×  108  ×  108 lattice, thereby avoiding any finite-size or finite temperature errors. A slight modification of Eq. ([\ref=macrid]),

[formula]

introduces the estimator for the CDD at temperature T = β- 1. To make a calculation of the CDD feasible, we collect its statistics in a cube with 403 number of sites. Note that this strategy does not introduce finite-size errors because only the τ = 0,β points of the partition function loop are confined to the 403-cube while the diagrams are free to sample all (108)3 sites.

The CDD estimator is effective for locating the localization parameters for large U only but, because of the requirement of finite temperatures, fails at small U  ≪  t. Note that the path-integral quantum Monte-Carlo algorithm [\cite=Kornilo], which is another method relevant for the problem formulated above [\cite=AlKo], has serious precision limits for the same reason. Hence, the only rigorous method to locate the localization point in the infinite system is to calculate the on-site zero temperature GF [formula], determine the LDOS [formula] by analytic continuation [\cite=MPSS] [\cite=Olle], and check for the presence of a bound state in the LDOS [formula] at the impurity site.

To validate the new implementation of the DMC technique, we located the critical Uc(λ = 0)  ≈  3.96 by calculating the CDD, normalized to unity at the impurity site, around the impurity. It occurred that for U  ≤  Uc the charge density does not decrease exponentially with distance from the impurity while for U > Uc it does. Perfect agreement is found between CDD obtained by DMC and that obtained in Ref. [\cite=KostSlet]. For U close to Uc, however, determination of the LDOS [formula] is a much more precise method, since the CDD requires finite temperatures.

First let us demonstrate how trapped polaron states are determined using the LDOS. From the commutator
