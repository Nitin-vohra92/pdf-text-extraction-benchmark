In this talk, I present new results [\cite=NOMURA] obtained from QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR), on the bag constant parameters entering in the analysis of the B0(s)-0(s) mass-differences. Taking the average of the results from the Laplace and moment sum rules, one obtains to order αs: [formula], in units where fπ = 130.7 MeV. Combined with the experimental data on the mass-differences ΔMd,s, one obtains the constraint on the CKM weak mixing angle: |Vts / Vtd|2  ≥  20.2(1.3). Alternatively, using the weak mixing angle from the analysis of the unitarity triangle and the data on ΔMd, one predicts ΔMs = 18.3(2.1) ~ ps- 1 in agreement with the present experimental lower bound and within the reach of Tevatron 2.

Introduction

B0(s) and 0(s) are not eigenstates of the weak hamiltonian, such that their oscillation frequency is gouverned by their mass-difference ΔMq. The measurement by the UA1 collaboration [\cite=UA1] of a large value of ΔMd was the first indication of a heavy top-quark mass. In the SM, the mass-difference is approximately given by [\cite=BURAS]:

[formula]

where the ΔB = 2 local operator Oq is defined as:

[formula]

with: [formula] and [formula]; S0, ~ ηB and CB(ν) are short distance quantities and Wilson coefficients which are calculable perturbatively, while the matrix element 〈0q|Oq|B0q〉 requires non-perturbative QCD calculations, and is usually parametrized for SU(N)c colours as:

[formula]

fBq is the Bq decay constant normalized as fπ = 92.4 MeV, and BBq is the so-called bag parameter which is BBq≃1 if one uses a vacuum saturation of the matrix element. From Eq. ([\ref=deltam]), it is clear that the measurement of ΔMd provides the one of the CKM mixing angle |Vtd| if one uses |Vtb|≃1. One can also extract this quantity from the ratio:

[formula]

since in the SM with three generations and unitarity constraints, |Vts|≃|Vcb|. Here:

[formula]

The great advantage of Eq. ([\ref=mass]) compared with the former relation in Eq. ([\ref=deltam]) is that in the ratio, different systematics in the evaluation of the matrix element tends to cancel out, thus providing a more accurate prediction. However, unlike ΔMd  =  0.473(17) ~ ps- 1, which is measured with a good precision [\cite=PDG], the determination of ΔMs is an experimental challenge due to the rapid oscillation of the B0s-0s system. At present, only a lower bound of 13.1 ps- 1 is available at the 95% CL from experiments [\cite=PDG], but this bound already provides a strong constraint on |Vtd|.

Two-point function sum rule

Ref. [\cite=PICH] has extended the analysis of the K0-q0 systems of [\cite=RAFAEL], using two-point correlator of the four-quark operators into the analysis of the quantity [formula] which gouverns the B0-0 mass difference. The two-point correlator defined as:

[formula]

is built from the ΔB = 2 weak operator defined in Eq. ([\ref=eq:operator]). The corresponding Laplace (resp. moment) sum rules are:

[formula]

The two-point function approach is very convenient due to its simple analytic properties which is not the case of approach based on three-point functions . However, it involves non-trivial QCD calculations which become technically complicated when one includes the contributions of radiative corrections due to non-factorizable diagrams. These perturbative radiative corrections due to factorizable and non-factorizable diagrams have been already computed in [\cite=PIVO] (referred as NP), where it has been found that the factorizable corrections are large while the non-factorizable ones are negligibly small. NP analysis has confirmed the estimate in [\cite=PICH] from lowest order calculations, where under some assumptions on the contributions of higher mass resonances to the spectral function, the value of the bag parameter BB has been found to be:

[formula]

This value is comparable with the one BBd  =  1 from the vacuum saturation estimate, which is expected to be a quite good approximation due to the relative high-scale of the B-meson mass. Equivalently, the corresponding RGI quantity is:

[formula]

where we have used the relation:

[formula]

with γ0 = 1 is the anomalous dimension of the operator Oq and β1 =  - 23 / 6 for 5 flavours. The NLO corrections have been obtained in the [formula] scheme [\cite=BURAS]. We have also used, to this order, the value [\cite=SNMAS] [\cite=SNB]:

[formula]

and Λ5 = (250  ±  50) ~ MeV [\cite=BETHKE]. In a forthcoming paper [\cite=NOMURA], we study (for the first time), from the QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) method, the SU(3) breaking effects on the ratio: ξ defined previously in Eq. ([\ref=bbs]), where a similar analysis of the ratios of the decay constants has given the values [\cite=SNFBS]:

[formula]

We also improve the previous result on BBd by the inclusion of the B* - B* resonances into the spectral function.

Results and implications on |Vts / Vtd|2 and ΔMs

We deduce by taking the average from the moments and Laplace sum rules results [\cite=NOMURA]:

[formula]

in units where fπ = 130.7 MeV. As expected, we have smaller errors for the ratio ξ due to the cancellation of the systematics, while for [formula], the error comes mainly and equally from the pole mass Mb and the truncation of the PT series where we have estimated the strength of the α2s contribution assuming a geometric growth of the PT coefficients. These results can be compared with different lattice and phenomenological determinations given in [\cite=LATT] [\cite=LATT2]. By comparing the ratio with the one of fBs / fBd in Eq. ([\ref=fbs]) , one can conclude (to a good approximation) that:

[formula]

indicating a negligible SU(3) breaking for the bag parameter. For a consistency, we have used the estimate to order αs [\cite=SNFB1]:

[formula]

and we have assumed that the error from fB compensates the one in Eq. ([\ref=xi]). The result is in excellent agreement with the previous result of [\cite=PIVO] in Eqs ([\ref=eq:pivo1]) and ([\ref=eq:pivo2]). Using the experimental values:

[formula]

one can deduce from Eq. ([\ref=mass]):

[formula]

Alternatively, using: ρsd≃28.4(2.9) obtained by using the Wolfenstein parameters determined in [\cite=LATT], we deduce:

[formula]

in good agreement with the present experimental lower bound and within the reach of Tevatron run 2 experiments.

Conclusions

We have applied QCD spectral sum rules for extracting (for the first time) the SU(3) breaking parameter in Eq. ([\ref=xi]). The phenomenological consequences of our results for the B0d,s-0d,s mass-differences and CKM mixing angle have been discussed. An extension of this work to the study of the B0s,d  -  0s,d width difference is in progress [\cite=PREP].
