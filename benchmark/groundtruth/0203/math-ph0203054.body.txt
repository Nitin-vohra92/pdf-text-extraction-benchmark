Introduction

In this paper we study one-dimensional discrete Schrödinger operators on the "half line" (that is on [formula]), which are defined by

[formula]

(where 0  <  φ  <  π) along with a phase boundary condition

[formula]

The actual value φ from the definition of the operator Hφ will not be significant, therefore we will omit the index φ and will write H instead of Hφ. We assume that V(n) is a Coulomb potential, that is V(n) satisfies

[formula]

for some constant C > 0. We prove below the following theorem:

Let a potential V(n) satisfy the condition ([\ref=con]). Let Ej, j = 1,2,..., be eigenvalues of H corresponding to l2-eigenvectors. Suppose all Ej's lie in ( - 2,2) and Ej  ≠  Ek if j  ≠  k. Then holds the following inequality:

[formula]

In particular, the eigenvalues which lie inside of the interval

[formula]

Remark. The similar result for continuous one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with potentials of Coulomb type decay was proved by Kiselev, Last and Simon in [\cite=KLS], and the similar result for Dirac operators with Coulomb potentials was proved by the author in [\cite=Kr].

Auxiliary results

We use a EFGP transformation (also called a Prüfer transformation) to rewrite the discrete Schrödinger equation

[formula]

for E from the interval ( - 2,2). So, suppose that E∈( - 2,2) and let y be some solution of ([\ref=scheq]). Write E = 2 cos x with x∈(0,π) and define R(n) > 0, θ(n) by

[formula]

(We note that EFGP variables R(n) and θ(n) depend on the spectral parameter x.) Denote [formula] with νx(n). Then R and θ obey the equations (see [\cite=KLS])

[formula]

[formula]

(due to [\cite=KLS], [\cite=KRS]) If   [formula], then

[formula]

Let (γn) be a sequence of real numbers with the property |γn + 1  -  γn|  ≤  C1 / n for some constant C1 > 0 for n > n0 and let α be some real number ≠  2πn, [formula]. Then the sequence

[formula]

is bounded.

Proof. We can assume without loss of generality n0 = 1. We use the Abel transformation to obtain

[formula]

The first summand is bounded as N  →    ∞   because of

[formula]

and the second one is bounded as N  →    ∞   because the series

[formula]

converges, for we can majorize [formula] by (1 + C1) / n2 because of

[formula]

Let xj, j = 1,...,m, be real numbers which satisfy 2xj  ≠  πn, [formula], for all j and xj  ±  xk  ≠  πn, [formula], for all j  ≠  k, and let θj(n), j = 1,...,m, be EFGP angles corresponding to the eigenvalues 2 cos xj of H. Denote θj(n) + xj with j(n). Then the sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

are bounded.

Proof. First of all we choose n0 so that holds |νxj(n)|  <  1 / 2 for all j = 1,...,m and for all n > n0. We can do it because of the condition ([\ref=con]) (note that min j = 1,...,m| sin xj| > 0). Then we use Lemma [\ref=l2.2] with three different definitions of γn and α: 1)γn: = 2(j(n) + k(n)) - 2xjn  -  2xkn and α: = 2xj + 2xk (j  ≠  k), 2)γn: = 2(j(n) - k(n)) - 2xjn  +  2xkn and α: = 2xj - 2xk (j  ≠  k) and 3)γn: = 4j(n) - 4xjn and α: = 4xj. In all three cases the condition [formula] is satisfied for n > n0, because of Lemma [\ref=l2.1] and the condition ([\ref=con]). (We note also that α's satisfy in all three cases the condition α  ≠  2πn.)

We consider only the real parts of [formula] to obtain that the following three sequences are bounded: [formula] (the case 1), [formula] (the case 2) and [formula] (the case 3).

Then we obtain the boundedness of ([\ref=c1]) by substraction of the first sequence from the second one and the boundedness of ([\ref=c2]) from the boundedness of the third one by the boundedness of the sequence [formula]. [formula]

(due to [\cite=KLS]) Let {ei}Ni = 1 be such a set of unit vectors in a Hilbert space H, that holds

[formula]

Then for any g from H holds

[formula]

For all x from (0,ε) (ε > 0) hold the inequalities

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. We have only to use Mean Value Theorem:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t1]

Let m be an arbitrary but fixed positive integer. We consider eigenvalues E1,...,Em. Write Ej = 2 cos xj with xj∈(0,π). Denote min j = 1,...,m sin xj with a. It is evident that a > 0. We assume for the moment that all xj's lie in the interval (0,π / 2).

Let EFGP-variables Rj(n) and j(n) correspond to the l2-solution y(n) of ([\ref=scheq]) with Ej = 2 cos xj (we assume that Rj is normalized by Rj(0) = 1). From ([\ref=EFGP0]) follows [formula], which implies

[formula]

Thus, there exists the sequence Nl  →    ∞   (monotonically) so that for j = 1,...,m and for all l holds

[formula]

Now we choose n0 so that for n > n0 holds the inequality C / an  <  1 / 2, which implies |νxj(n)|  <  1 / 2 for all j = 1,..,m. Using ([\ref=EFGP1]) we obtain from ([\ref=eq]):

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=l.ln] and Lemma [\ref=l2.1], the condition ([\ref=con]) and the monotone behavior of the function ln x, we obtain from the last inequality for every j:

[formula]

where aj,n is defined by

[formula]

From the condition ([\ref=con]) follows easily the convergence of the series

[formula]

which implies (taking in account ([\ref=eq2])) that there exists such a constant C2, that for all j and all l holds the following inequality:

[formula]

Now we define for each fixed l the Hilbert space Hl as follows: Hl: =   l2(n0,...,Nl - 1)(n), that is the set of all finite sequences (bn)Nl - 1n = n0 with the scalar product [formula] (where b = (bn), c = (cn)).

We define vectors fj(n), ej(n) (∈Hl) by [formula], [formula]. From xj  ≠  xk, j  ≠  k, and xj∈(0,π / 2) follows 4xj  ≠  2πn, 2xj  ±  2xk  ≠  2πn, j  ≠  k, so we can apply Corollary [\ref=c2.3] to obtain from ([\ref=c2])

[formula]

(O(1) denotes here and further any quantity which is bounded as l  →    ∞  .)

If j  ≠  k we have from ([\ref=c1]):

[formula]

So we can use Lemma [\ref=l2.4] with g:   = V(n)∈Hl with sufficiently large Nl (so that for [formula] from the last formula holds [formula]) to obtain the inequality

[formula]

From the last inequality together with ([\ref=ineq1]) and with the inequality

[formula]

(where we used the condition ([\ref=con])) follows now for sufficiently large Nl's:

[formula]

On the other hand we have

[formula]

As we can choose Nl arbitrarily large, we obtain then [formula].

It is easy to see that if we replace the assumption xj∈(0,π / 2) for all j = 1,...,m by the new assumption xj∈(π / 2,π) for all j = 1,...,m, the whole consideration remains valid (we have in this case also 2xj  ±  2xk  ≠  2πn, j  ≠  k, and 4xj  ≠  2πn). Returning to a general situation we have now to take in account the "critical" point π / 2. Because of sin (π / 2) = 1 we obtain in a general situation the inequality

[formula]

The right side of this inequality is independent of m, therefore we can replace the finite sum on the left with the infinite sum [formula]. We have now only to use the relation sin 2xj = 1 -  cos 2xj = 1 - E2j / 4. The inequality ([\ref=eqt.1]) is proved.

From ([\ref=eqt.1]) it is easy to see, that for each fixed ε from (0,1) there exists at most finite number of eigenvalues Ej with Ej∈( - 2 + ε,2 - ε). So the only possible accumulation points of the set of eigenvalues of H lying in the interval
