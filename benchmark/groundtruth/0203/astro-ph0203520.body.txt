Abstract

The computation of PBH (primordial black hole) production from primordial perturbations has recently been improved by considering a more accurate relation between the primordial power spectrum and the PBH mass variance. We present here exact expressions which are valid for primordial spectra of arbitrary shape and which allow accurate numerical calculations. We then consider the possibility to have a significant part of dark matter in the form of PBHs produced by a primordial spectrum of inflationary origin possessing a characteristic scale. We show that in this model the relevant PBH mass is constrained to lie in the range [formula]. This is much less than the mass range coming from the QCD phase transition, allowing the two mechanisms to be easily distinguished.

Introduction: A consistent paradigm seems to emerge in cosmology, of which dark matter is an essential ingredient. However, the nature of dark matter remains to be one of the most important open problems. It is expected to account for about one quarter of the present critical energy density, most of the remaining three quarters being dark energy whose nature is also unknown. There exist many candidates which are classified into cold, hot, and warm dark matter. Some of these candidates would signal new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, such as relic neutralinos, the supersymmetric cold dark matter (CDM) candidate. Another possible CDM candidate could be primordial black holes (PBHs). The advantage with them is that their existence rests on known physics, general relativity and the presence of primordial fluctuations, independent of the mechanism which generates them. Indeed, it is well known that PBHs can be produced in the early universe due to the collapse of overdense regions on the linear size of the Hubble radius at the time when this corresponds to their Schwarzschild radius [\cite=CH74]. These fluctuations in the energy density must exist one way or the other in order to explain the origin of all inhomogeneities we see in the universe. Their existence, and in particular their primordial origin, is reflected in the presence of acoustic peaks in the cosmological microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, and is now well established by observations. Therefore, the generation of PBHs is unavoidable. Inflationary fluctuations are produced on a huge range of scales and the observation of PBHs formed after inflation could probe the fluctuations on scales where the CMB gives no information. It would therefore be complementary to the results which are extracted from the CMB data.

PBHs were produced in the very early universe. PBHs generated before 10- 23 s, corresponding to masses M < M*  ≈  5  ×  1014 g, have already evaporated by the present day due to Hawking radiation. PBHs with masses bigger than M* could, however, constitute a significant fraction, or even all, of the CDM. Unfortunately this possibility, though attractive, cannot be implemented with scale-free perturbations because they would lead to a negligible rate of PBH formation. However, in view of the naturalness of PBH generation, it is important to investigate whether other kinds of spectra could lead to a significant formation rate.

General formalism: We will consider Gaussian primordial fluctuations, the kind of fluctuations expected in most inflationary models. The density contrast averaged over a sphere of radius R then reads

[formula]

where the dispersion [formula] is computed using a top-hat window function,

[formula]

P(k) is the primordial power spectrum, and WTH(kR) is the Fourier transform of the top-hat window function divided by the probed volume [formula],

[formula]

The probability β(MH) that a region of comoving size [formula] has an averaged density contrast at horizon crossing tk in the range δmin  ≤  δ  ≤  δmax, is given by

[formula]

where [formula]. Recently, the connection between the mass variance on very small scales and the normalization on present COBE scales has been improved yielding a substantially lower mass variance [\cite=BKP1]. This formalism also allows for an accurate calculation of the mass variance for spectra with features. The quantity [formula] is often used; it is related to σ2H(tk) for an arbitrary primordial power spectrum as [\cite=P02] [\cite=BBKP]

[formula]

where [formula] (radiation-dominated phase). The time-independent quantity F(k) defines the primordial spectrum on super-Hubble radius scales. The upper integration limit can safely be taken to be infinity due to the rapid convergence of the integral. The evolution of the fluctuations on small scales differs from the long wave evolution, and this difference is encoded in the transfer function T(k',t). At the present day we have tk = t0, ~ k = k0 = a0H0 and T(k',tk)  ≠  T(k',t0). This is why the relation between σ2H(tk) and δ2H(tk) is not the same as today. An accurate evaluation of the transfer function will be presented elsewhere [\cite=BBKP] and gives

[formula]

A pure scale-invariant spectrum corresponds to F(k) = constant, and a numerical estimate for a critical-density universe (Ωm,0 = 1) gives [\cite=BBKP]

[formula]

The prefactors in the second and last equality differ by a factor [formula] which takes into account the transition from radiation to matter domination. In particular, the constraint on a pure blue spectrum (spectral index n > 1) is weakened. The inclusion of a cosmological constant Λ with ΩΛ,0 = 0.7 reduces the mass variance even further by about 15% [\cite=P02]. This constant decrease is degenerate with an increase in δmin [\cite=BBKP], so we choose to make our numerical simulations for the fiducial case Ωm,0 = 1, ~ δmin = 0.7. However, there is another important aspect of ([\ref=sigF1]). For a spectrum with a feature at some scale ks, the shape of the power spectrum will translate in a non-trivial way into σ2H(tk) (see, e.g., Fig. 1 below). Though the refinements described here make the prospects for the cosmological relevance of PBHs less promising since it reduces the probability to form PBHs, the situation looks bad only for scale-free spectra. Indeed, potentials with a feature on small scales could dramatically improve the PBH formation rate. This possibility was already considered in the past [\cite=INN94] [\cite=RSG96] and we would like to take it up again in the light of the improved calculations done in [\cite=BKP1].

PBH as a CDM candidate: It is not possible to have a significant fraction of the dark matter in the form of PBHs with a scale-free powerlaw primordial spectrum. We assume that the probability β(M) represents the fraction of the energy density at the PBH formation time that is going to form PBHs with mass M. Their present contribution to the critical density, ΩPBH,0, is then given by [\cite=BKP1]

[formula]

For a pure Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum normalized to COBE, the mass variance at Hubble-radius crossing, and therefore β(M), is (nearly) constant on all mass scales. When we go to lower masses, the corresponding ΩPBH,0 increases [formula] because PBHs of lower mass form earlier in the radiation era, while their energy density decreases less rapidly than that of radiation. On the other hand, the COBE normalization of the spectrum results in β(M)  ≪  10- 17 so that this increase is by far insufficient and will result in a negligible contribution of PBHs to the present energy density. One way to circumvent the problem is to invoke a blue spectrum, n > 1, in which case n  ≈  1.3 is needed in order to have a significant contribution with PBHs of mass M* [\cite=GL] [\cite=BKP1]. In such models, the spectral index is assumed to be constant over a huge range of scales. A more serious problem is that as the Hubble mass at the end of inflation is lower than M*, a sharp constraint exists on the density of evaporated PBHs from their contribution to the γ-ray background, ΩPBH,0  ~  10- 8. Therefore, a blue spectrum that satisfies the bound from the γ-ray background necessarily yields ΩPBH,0  ≪  1. The only way out is to boost the production of PBHs in a localized way.

Microlensing gives no detection limits on the mass of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) below [formula]. On the other hand, it is advantageous to form PBHs earlier, with masses not too far from M*. For larger masses, larger values for β are required in order to achieve the same ΩPBH,0. We are thus looking for a spectrum which increases β(M) in this region, but not in the mass range MPBH  ≤  M*. This cannot be achieved neither with a blue spectrum, nor using a pure step-like spectrum with more power on small scales [\cite=BKP1]. In the following we shall present a model with a feature at some characteristic scale, where this is possible.

The model: We consider here a model based on an inflaton potential with a step in its first derivative. The adiabatic perturbations spectrum was derived analytically by Starobinsky [\cite=S92] and has been applied either to explain a possible bump in the matter power spectrum P(k) [\cite=LPS98] on a scale k  ≈  125h- 1Mpc or on small scales as a cure to the dwarf galaxy problem [\cite=KL00]. In our case the feature will be placed on even much smaller scales, typically the scale corresponding to PBHs with mass M*. We expect that a deeper understanding of fundamental theories could give a distinguished scale from which the PBH formation rate could be calculated. In this model, the spectrum is defined by a characteristic scale ks (or mass Ms) and a parameter p, where p2 is the ratio of the power spectrum on large scales with respect to that on small scales. In view of its rich structure in the vicinity of Ms, in particular its oscillations, one must use ([\ref=sigF1]) in this crucial part of the spectrum in order to compute σH(M) correctly. The probability β(MH) to produce a PBH with mass M is obtained from the primordial spectrum in a non-trivial way according to

[formula]

with [formula], and tk is the Hubble radius ("horizon") crossing time k = (aH)tk. The non-trivial way in which the primordial spectrum F(k) translates into the mass variance σH(M) is obvious from Fig. 1.

We must distinguish three mass ranges: M  ≪  Mpeak, M  ~  Mpeak and M  ≫  Mpeak. For large masses M  ≫  Mpeak, β(M) is unsignificant; in this range we have a (nearly) flat plateau normalized to COBE. For small masses, M  ≪  Mpeak, we are on the higher plateau satisfying ([\ref=beta2]) (see below). Note that on both plateaus, corresponding to an effective spectral index n = 1, PBHs of arbitrary mass are equally probable in view of ([\ref=omega]). The probability β(M) that is obtained using ([\ref=omega],[\ref=sig]) displays a pronounced bump around the mass scale Mpeak  ≈  0.6 ~ Ms, see Fig. 2.

The crucial property is the drop on smaller scales M  ≪  Mpeak which, as we will show, is sufficient in order to satisfy the severe upper bounds set on the contribution of evaporated PBHs to the diffuse γ-ray background.

Using the gravitational constraint ([\ref=omega]), it is possible, for each value of the parameter Ms to find the value of p  ≥  pmin which yields ΩPBH,0  ≤  0.3. This is shown in Fig. 3. Let us consider now the range of masses which have already evaporated by now and that contribute to the γ-ray background. Actually only a relatively small range ΔM with masses 2  ×  1013 g  ≤  M  ≤  5  ×  1014 g contributes significantly to the observed diffuse γ-ray background [\cite=KL99]. The fraction of energy density going into PBHs in this mass range obeys

[formula]

Taking ΩPBH,0(Mpeak) = 0.3, this leads to the constraint

[formula]

Note that we have used here the stronger constraint ΩPBH,0(M  ≪  Mpeak)  <  10- 8 for each scale M  ≪  Mpeak rather than the (integrated) constraint ΩPBH,0(ΔM)  <  10- 8.

A shift in the location of the characteristic mass Ms (and corresponding scale ks) to higher masses (still much smaller than [formula]) is allowed, but smaller values of p will then be needed in order to achieve ΩPBH,0 = 0.3. However, this in turn increases the ratio [formula] which therefore gives an upper bound to Mpeak around 1021 g as can be seen on Fig. 3. Hence, requiring that ΩPBH,0 = 0.3, the γ-ray background constraint can be satisfied for a range of characteristic masses Ms (with Ms  ≈  1.6 ~ Mpeak)

[formula]

For higher Mpeak, the γ-ray background constraint is no longer satisfied. An observational constraint on the allowed range of MACHO masses would therefore give a strong constraint on our model as it must correspond to the window ([\ref=Ms]).

The bump for M≃Mpeak is well localized, hence the PBH masses in this model indicate essentially the location of the characteristic scale Ms in the primordial spectrum. Besides the various improvements we have used for the calculation of PBH production, we note that the model presented here contains one singularity in the inflaton potential, in contrast to the more sophisticated version with two bumps considered in [\cite=INN94].

It is interesting to compare these results with the approach in which PBHs of various masses M are produced by near critical collapse [\cite=NJ98] at one single time, the horizon crossing time tk corresponding to MH(tk) = Mpeak, with

[formula]

One finds for γ = 0.35, following [\cite=Y98],

[formula]

This is turn yields

[formula]

a result analogous to that obtained when PBHs of various mass M are produced at different times tk with M = MH(tk); in the latter case one obtains ΩPBH,tot(tkpeak)  =  β(Mpeak). Hence, our constraint on ΩPBH,0(Mpeak) using ([\ref=omega]) is stronger than the requirement ΩPBH,tot(t0)  ≤  0.3 based on ([\ref=omcc]). Note that Mpeak-MH in the notation of [\cite=Y98]- is the Hubble mass corresponding to the peak in the quantity β(M), not in the primordial spectrum itself, due to the distinction one has to make between the quantities σH(tk) and δH(tk). We stress also that the above mentioned approach does not take into account the properties of the feature in the primordial spectrum, in particular the width of the corresponding bump in β, besides the value β(Mpeak) which serves as a kind of overall normalization of the PBH abundance. On the other hand, it does account in a consistent way for the production of PBHs also in the monotonically increasing part of β(M) around Mpeak, [formula]. Obviously, the more spiky the primordial spectrum, the better this approach is expected to be, and our model provides such a concrete spectrum based on an underlying inflationary dynamics. An accurate determination of the mass spectrum would therefore yield valuable information, not only on the underlying primordial perturbations spectrum but also on PBH formation itself.

In conclusion, we have considered a power spectrum of inflationary origin in which PBHs constitute a significant part of CDM. In fact, it has already been speculated that the QCD phase transition could lead to PBHs of about one solar mass [\cite=KJ], in accordance with microlensing observations made some years ago. In our model PBHs are generated with much smaller mass. Our analysis is based on an accurate calculation of the mass variance at the PBH formation time tk and of the corresponding β(M). Though it was found recently that a more accurate computation of the probability to produce PBHs actually leads to a decrease of this probability, this letter shows that one can still have a significant ΩPBH,0 by using primordial spectra in concrete models with a characteristic scale on very small scales, scales much smaller than those usually probed by CMB anisotropy or large scale structure formation.
