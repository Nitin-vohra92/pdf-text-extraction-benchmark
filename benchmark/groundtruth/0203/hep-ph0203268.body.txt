Introduction

The spectrum of the applications of the 1 / Nc expansion [\cite=Hooft-74] to the analysis of the dynamics of strong interactions is rather rich. However, the parton distributions of hadrons remained a sort of exception for a long time. Historically the large Nc behavior of parton distributions was first analyzed in the context of the chiral quark soliton model [\cite=DPPPW-96] [\cite=PP-1996] but the general structure of the Nc counting in this model is the same as in QCD.

Among recent applications of the large Nc expansion to parton distributions one should mention the phenomenological analysis of the antiquark polarized distribution [\cite=DGPW-99], of the polarized gluon distribution [\cite=EGP-2000] and the large Nc relations between the quark distributions in the nucleon and in the Δ resonance [\cite=Chen-Ji-01]. Here we shall consider another interesting result: combining the large Nc expansion with the probabilistic interpretation of parton distributions one can derive certain inequalities for parton distributions [\cite=PP-2000] which are stronger than the corresponding inequalities known in the case of finite Nc.

Our analysis will be based on the standard picture of the large Nc baryons [\cite=Witten-79] as states that can be described by mean field (Hartree) equations of some effective theory. Although the exact action of this effective theory equivalent to the large Nc QCD is not known certain conclusions can be made using only the assumption about the symmetry [\cite=Witten-83] [\cite=Balachandran-83] [\cite=Dashen-94] of the solutions of the corresponding Hartree equations.

The large Nc inequalities described here are not mere products of the large Nc pure art per se. For example, they include the enhanced large Nc version of Soffer inequality [\cite=Soffer-95] for the transversity distribution that can be of interest for the phenomenological applications. Actually some of the results considered here were noticed earlier [\cite=PP-1996] in the context of the quark-soliton model [\cite=DPPPW-96]. Since the derivation was based only on the spin-flavor symmetry of the large Nc baryons the generalization to the case of the large Nc QCD is rather straightforward.

Positivity bounds at finite Nc

Let us first recall the well-known positivity properties of parton distributions in the real world at finite number of colors. The unpolarized parton distribution qf(x) is defined as the probability to find a quark of type f carrying fraction x of the nucleon momentum in the infinite momentum frame. The positivity of this probability leads us to the simplest inequality qf(x)  ≥  0. If one considers the longitudinally polarized nucleon then qf(x) can be decomposed into two pieces coming from quarks with the longitudinal spin collinear with nucleon momentum ([formula]) and with anticollinear spin ([formula])

[formula]

Since both functions [formula] and [formula] have a probabilistic interpretation they are positive

[formula]

The (longitudinally) polarized parton distribution is defined as

[formula]

Now it follows from ([\ref=q-decompos]), ([\ref=q-pol-pos]), ([\ref=q-pol-def])

[formula]

Next, one can consider the nucleon and quarks with the transverse polarization and define by analogy with ΔLqf the transversity distribution ΔTqf which will obey inequality

[formula]

One more inequality can be obtained by choosing arbitrary directions for the polarizations of quarks and nucleons. The positivity of the corresponding probabilities leads to Soffer inequality [\cite=Soffer-95]

[formula]

Positivity bounds at large Nc

Thus in the real world with Nc = 3 (and at any other finite Nc) we have the following set of the positivity bounds for the unpolarized (qf), longitudinally polarized (ΔLqf) and transversity (ΔTqf) quark distributions

[formula]

Below we shall derive the following analogs of these inequalities in the large Nc limit:

[formula]

Note that these inequalities for the large Nc case are stronger than the corresponding inequalities at finite Nc ([\ref=finite-N-c-ineq]) because of the factors 1 / 3 and 1 / 2 appearing in the right-hand sides. The origin of these factors can be traced to the spin-flavor symmetry of the large Nc baryons; in particular, the factor of 1 / 3 has nothing to do with the fact that 1 / Nc = 1 / 3 in the real world.

This enhancement of the positivity bounds in the large Nc limit is rather a striking result. Naively one could expect that in the leading order of the large Nc limit some part of information about parton distributions would be lost but instead in this limit we have new stronger bounds. The reason of this phenomenon can be explained in simple terms without appealing to the technical derivation of ([\ref=new-ineq]). In the leading order of the large Nc approximation the nucleon is degenerate with the Δ resonance and other baryonic resonances with [formula] For all of these particles one can analyze the twist-two parton distributions and derive the corresponding positivity bounds. Moreover, since all these particles are degenerate at the level of the leading order of the 1 / Nc expansion one can consider the formal superposition of states with different values of T = J and derive the positivity bounds for the parton distribution function of these formal superpositions. Although the superpositions of states with different T = J make no physical sense this formal trick allows us to derive the new enhanced positivity bounds ([\ref=new-ineq]) valid in the large Nc limit.

Large Nc counting for parton distributions

In order to derive the large Nc inequalities ([\ref=new-ineq]) we should start from the analysis of the large Nc behavior of the parton distributions. This analysis can be performed using standard large Nc counting rules of QCD (see e.g. [\cite=DPPPW-96] [\cite=EGP-2000] [\cite=Chen-Ji-01]). On the other hand, it is well known that the same large Nc behavior of various quantities can be also extracted from the nonrelativistic quark model, Skyrme model, quark soliton model etc. Below we briefly describe the large Nc behavior of parton distributions appealing mainly to the naive quark model and using sum rules for parton distributions.

Note the twist-two parton distributions qf(x),  ΔLqf(x),  ΔTqf(x) depend on Bjorken variable x so that the analysis of the large Nc behavior should involve a convention about the behavior of x in this limit. From the physical point of view the nucleon consists of Nc quarks (with an admixture of quark-antiquark pairs) so that it is natural to expect that at large Nc limit the nucleon momentum in the infinite momentum frame is more or less uniformly distributed between O(Nc) quarks and antiquarks. Then in the large Nc limit it makes sense to concentrate on x = O(1 / Nc). This physical argument shows that that the large Nc behavior of various parton distributions should have the form

[formula]

[formula]

Functions φf,  ΔLφf,  ΔTφf are stable in the large Nc limit so that the x dependence of the form φf(Ncx) implies that x  ~  N- 1c at large x. The factor of N2c ensures the consistency of the large Nc behavior for various sum rules for parton distributions. For example for the baryon charge sum rule

[formula]

we find in the large Nc limit

[formula]

[formula]

which really agrees with the sum rule ([\ref=baryon-number-sum-rule]).

In the leading order of the large Nc limit we have for the u and d distribution functions of the proton [\cite=DPPPW-96]:

[formula]

[formula]

These large Nc relations have a simple interpretation in the nonrelativistic quark model: at large odd Nc the proton consists of (Nc + 1) / 2 u-quarks and (Nc - 1) / 2 d-quarks. In the leading order of large Nc we have the same amount of u and d quarks which means that [formula]. Next, since we want to have the spin of the proton 1 / 2, at large Nc there must be a cancelation between the O(Nc) parts of the spin of u and d quarks, which is expressed by the last two equations ([\ref=q-u-q-d]).

Derivation of large Nc inequalities

Below we sketch the main ideas of the derivation of inequalities ([\ref=new-ineq]). The complete description can be found in ref. [\cite=PP-2000].

Although we cannot compute parton distributions in the large Nc QCD, still it is possible to write certain general relations using only the spin-flavor symmetry of the large Nc baryons. The twist-two quark distributions qu,ΔLqu,ΔTqu in proton can be represented in the form

[formula]

Here [formula] is an 8  ×  8 matrix with SU(2) flavor indices [formula] and with Dirac spin indices [formula]. Matrix ρ(x) depending on x is determined by the dynamics of the large Nc QCD and is not known. Nevertheless we are aware of the following general properties:

1) ρ is a hermitean positive matrix (i.e. all eigenvalues are positive or zero)

[formula]

[formula]

2) ρ lives in the subspace of the projector (1 + γ0γ3) / 2

[formula]

3) ρ commutes with [formula]

[formula]

These properties allow us to write the following general representation for ρ(x)

[formula]

where ci(x) are some scalar functions of x.

The positivity property ([\ref=rho-positive-0]) leads to the following constraints on coefficients ci

[formula]

[formula]

Inserting the explicit representation for ρ ([\ref=rho-c]) into the general equations for parton distributions ([\ref=q-rho]) we immediately express the parton distributions fi(x) in terms the coefficients ci(x). Then the constraints ([\ref=c-ineq-1]), ([\ref=c-ineq-2]) on these coefficients immediately lead to bounds ([\ref=new-ineq]) on parton distributions.

Phenomenological status

Concerning the practical applications of the large Nc inequalities we have to keep in mind two competing factors:

1) large Nc inequalities ([\ref=new-ineq]) are stronger than the standard inequalities ([\ref=finite-N-c-ineq]) valid at finite Nc,

2) at finite Nc inequalities ([\ref=new-ineq]) can be violated by large 1 / Nc corrections.

In the case of ΔLqf the 1 / Nc corrections are known to be rather large. Indeed, the Bjorken sum rule relates ΔLqu  -  ΔLqd with the axial constant gA and it is well known that gA is usually underestimated in various model calculations based on the leading order of the 1 / Nc expansion, which is usually attributed to sizable 1 / Nc corrections. Hence the 1 / Nc corrections to ΔLqf should be also large. Therefore one should not wonder that our large Nc inequality for ΔLqu  -  ΔLqd

[formula]

following from ([\ref=new-ineq]), ([\ref=q-u-q-d]) is in conflict with experimental data. For example, in the GRSV parametrization [\cite=GRSV-2001]

[formula]

On the other hand, the large Nc bounds ([\ref=finite-N-c-ineq]) can be of use in the case of the transversity distribution and polarized antiquark distribution where the experimental knowledge is rather poor.

Concluding remarks

In the large Nc limit one has the positivity bounds ([\ref=finite-N-c-ineq]) for twist-two parton distributions that are stronger than the standard positivity bounds at finite Nc. However, the practical applications of the large Nc inequalities are sensitive to the size of the 1 / Nc corrections.

In the case of finite Nc it is well known that positivity bounds ([\ref=finite-N-c-ineq]) are compatible with the DGLAP evolution equations in the following sense. If inequalities ([\ref=finite-N-c-ineq]) hold at some normalization point then the one-loop evolution to higher normalization points will not violate these inequalities. In ref. [\cite=PP-2000] it was shown that the large Nc inequalities ([\ref=new-ineq]) have the same property: if one uses the evolution kernels only in the leading order of the large Nc expansion then inequalities ([\ref=new-ineq]) are preserved by the evolution upwards.
