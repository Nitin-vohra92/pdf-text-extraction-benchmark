Rationally connected varieties over finite fields

In this paper we study rationally connected varieties defined over finite fields. Then we lift these results to rationally connected varieties over local fields.

Roughly speaking, a variety X over an algebraically closed field is rationally connected if it contains a rational curve through any number of assigned points [formula]. See [\cite=Ko01] for an introduction to their theory and for an explanation of the place of rationally connected varieties in the framework of the classification theory of algebraic varieties. There are many equivalent conditions defining this notion, see, for instance, [\cite=rcbook]. The definition given below essentially corresponds to the case of 2 points. In positive characteristic we also have to be mindful of some inseparability problems.

A smooth, proper variety X is called separably rationally connected or SRC, if there is a variety U and a morphism [formula] such that the induced map

[formula]

is dominant and separable.

If X is defined over a field k and the Pi are also defined over k, it is of interest to find rational curves defined over k passing through these points. In general this cannot be done. For instance, consider the surface

[formula]

Let S  ⊃  S0 be any smooth compactification. The fibers of the projection to the z-axis [formula] are conics, thus S is ruled over [formula]. Therefore S is rational over [formula]. As a topological space [formula] has m connected components. If we pick points P1,P2 in different connected components of [formula] then there is no rational curve defined over [formula] passing through both points (since [formula] is connected).

The main technical result of the present paper (Theorem [\ref=main.geom.thm]) implies that for finite fields one can almost always find such rational curves. More precisely, we have the following:

There is a function [formula] with the following property:

Let [formula] be a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected variety of dimension ≥  3 over a finite field k and S  ⊂  X a zero-dimensional smooth subscheme.

If |k| > Φ( deg X, dim X, deg S), then there is a smooth rational curve CS  ⊂  X containing S, where |k| denotes the cardinality of k.

(1) If dim X = 2 then there are very few smooth rational curves even over k̄. For instance, in [formula] the only smooth rational curves are lines and conics. If S consists of 3 points on a line plus another point then there is no smooth rational curve containing S.

For all applications considered in this paper, one can work with [formula] instead of the surface X to obtain the relevant conclusions.

One can also see from the proof that if X is a surface, we obtain an immersed curve [formula] through S.

(2) We can also be more precise about the curve CS. For instance, with small modifications of the proof one sees that Theorem [\ref=main.charp.thm] remains true if we only assume that S has embedding dimension 1.

We can also require that CS avoid a given codimension 2 subset of X and that it be transversal to a given divisor at all points outside S.

(3) The function Φ is explicitly computable from the proof though it is rather huge. Even if we allow singular curves CS, some condition on |k| is needed. For instance, the number of k-points in S cannot exceed |k| + 1, the number of k-points in [formula]. We do not know any other necessary condition with singular CS. In the smooth case, there are also problems with too few k-points. For instance, [\cite=SD] contains an example of a cubic surface S over [formula] with only one rational point. Thus S  ×  S does not contain any smooth rational curves defined over [formula]. We do not know what a reasonable Φ should be.

(4) By a recent result of [\cite=esn], an SRC variety defined over a finite field always has a point in that field.

We give two applications of this result to the study of the R-equivalence of points and the Chow group of 0-cycles [formula]. The interesting part is the Chow group of degree zero 0-cycles, denoted by [formula].

The Chow group of zero cycles over a finite field is completely described in [\cite=ka-sa]. Their result implies that if X is a smooth, projective variety defined over a finite field which is geometrically simply connected then [formula]. SRC varieties were recently shown to be geometrically simply connected (see [\cite=kol-let] or [\cite=deb-b]), so [formula] for them. We give a geometric proof of this result for SRC varieties. The advantage of this proof is that it allows one to go from finite fields to local fields. (For our purposes local fields are the quotient fields of complete discrete valuation rings with finite residue field.) Lifting results of this type have been known for cubic surfaces [\cite=SD]. Recently this was extended to cubic hypersurfaces [\cite=ct-stud??]. For surfaces both results were established by [\cite=ct-surfcase].

[\cite=ka-sa] Let k be a finite field and X a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected variety over k. Then [formula].

Let K be a local field with residue field k and X a variety over K. Assume that X has a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected reduction over k. Then [formula].

R-equivalence on cubic surfaces was introduced in [\cite=manin] in order to study the parametrization of rational points. [\cite=SD] proves that R-equivalence is trivial on smooth cubic surfaces over finite fields. Precise computations on certain algebraic groups and related spaces are done in [\cite=gille1] [\cite=gille2] [\cite=mb01] [\cite=mb02].

Let X be a proper variety defined over a field k. Two points x,x'∈X(k) are called directly R-equivalent if there is a morphism [formula] (defined over k) such that f(0:1) = x and f(1:0) = x'. The equivalence relation generated by this is called R-equivalence. Informally speaking, two points are R-equivalent if they can be connected by a chain of rational curves over k. If all the points in X(k) are R-equivalent, then we say that R-equivalence is trivial on X(k).

There is a function [formula] with the following property:

Let [formula] be a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected variety over the finite field k. If |k| > Ψ( deg X, dim X) then R-equivalence is trivial on X(k).

There is a function [formula] with the following property:

Let K be a local field with residue-field k and [formula] a variety over K. Assume that X has a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected reduction over k. If |k| > Ψ'( deg X, dim X) then R-equivalence is trivial on X(K).

The following corollary answers a question of Colliot-Thélène which was the starting point of our investigations. Let X be a smooth projective variety over a number field K. For a prime P, let XP denote the corresponding variety over the P-adic completion KP. Our results imply that the Chow group of zero cycles and R-equivalence are both trivial for almost every completion. This has been known in several special cases, see [\cite=cts] [\cite=ct-surfcase] [\cite=ctssd] [\cite=gille2] [\cite=mb01] [\cite=mb02].

Let X be a smooth projective rationally connected variety over a number field K. Then [formula] and R-equivalence is trivial on X(KP) for all but finitely many primes P.

The main technical result of the paper is a statement about SRC varieties over arbitrary perfect fields:

Let [formula] be a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected variety of dimension ≥  3 over a perfect field k. Let S  ⊂  X be a zero-dimensional smooth subscheme.

Then there is a nonempty locally closed subset W of the Hilbert scheme [formula] such that

W parametrizes certain smooth rational curves C  ⊂  X of degree d(X,S) which contain S.

W is geometrically irreducible and smooth.

The restriction TX|Cw( - S) is ample.

d(X,S) is bounded from above in terms of dim X, deg X and deg S.

In contrast with some similar results (for instance [\cite=rcfg2]) we no longer have k-points in compactifications of W. We lose this in Step 2 of ([\ref=main.steps.say]).

Assume that k is algebraically closed. Let [formula] denote the space of all rational curves in X passing through S. If α denotes a numerical equivalence class of curves, then R(X) decomposes as a disjoint union [formula]. It is reasonable to expect that for "general" α, the spaces Rα(X,S) are irreducible. This would be a much stronger statement than ([\ref=main.geom.thm]). There are, however, very few definitive results in this direction. The case when X is homogeneous and [formula] is treated in [\cite=kim-pandh]. Lines on low degree hypersurfaces are discussed in [\cite=hmp].

The most straightforward application of ([\ref=main.geom.thm]) is to varieties over pseudo-algebraically closed fields. By definition, a pseudo-algebraically closed field or PAC field is a field k such that every geometrically irreducible k-variety has a dense set of k-points. (See [\cite=fried-jardin] for many examples and properties of such fields.) ([\ref=main.geom.thm]) now implies the following:

Let X be a smooth, projective, separably rationally connected variety of dimension ≥  3 over a perfect PAC field k and S  ⊂  X a zero-dimensional smooth subscheme.

Then there is a smooth, geometrically rational curve CS  ⊂  X which is defined over k and contains S.

In particular, R-equivalence is trivial on X(k) and [formula].

The proof of the implication ([\ref=main.PAC.thm]) ⇒   ([\ref=main.charp.thm]) is completely formal using the fact that the ultraproduct of infinitely many finite fields whose orders go to infinity is PAC. See, for instance, [\cite=fried-jardin] for such techniques.

A more classical proof, given below, relies on some basic boundedness results and on the Lang-Weil theorem [\cite=Lang-Weil] (which is also at the core of the above ultraproduct result).

For a quasi-projective scheme [formula] let [formula] denote its closure and [formula] its boundary. Define the degree of a reduced projective scheme to be the sum of the degrees of its irreducible components (even if they have different dimensions). We call N, dim (U), [formula] and deg (∂U) the basic projective invariants of a reduced quasi-projective scheme U.

The set of all reduced quasi-projective schemes with given basic projective invariants is bounded. That is, there is a scheme of finite type S and a locally closed subscheme [formula] such that every reduced quasi-projective scheme with given basic projective invariants occurs among the fibers of U  →  S. (This is an easy consequence of the classical theorem, going back to Cayley, that the Chow variety of pure dimensional reduced closed subschemes of [formula] of a given degree is bounded. See [\cite=ho-pe] for a classical treatment and [\cite=rcbook] for a modern update.)

Conversely, if S is a scheme of finite type and [formula] is a locally closed subscheme then the basic projective invariants of the fibers form a bounded set.

Using basic existence results of the relative Hilbert scheme (see, for instance, [\cite=rcbook]), we get the following:

Let [formula] be a projective variety and S  ⊂  X a zero-dimensional subvariety. Let [formula] be the locally closed subset of the Hilbert scheme parametrizing all smooth curves of degree d containing S. Let Wid  ⊂  Wd be any irreducible component.

Then the basic projective invariants of Wid can be bounded in terms of dim X, deg X, deg S and d.

The easiest case, Step 1, is handled in the following, essentially proved in [\cite=rcloc]. (See also [\cite=arko] or [\cite=rcfg2] where a much stronger result is proved.)

Let [formula] be a smooth, projective, SRC variety over a field k and P∈X(k) a point. Then there is a family of rational curves

[formula]

defined over k, with the following properties:

FP(VP  ×  (0:1))  =  P.

FP:VP  ×  (1:0)  →  X is smooth, hence dominant.

VP is geometrically irreducible and smooth.

The pullback of TX to each curve [formula] is ample, even after twisting by O( - 3).

The degree of the curves [formula] is bounded in terms of dim X and deg X.

A genus zero comb over k with n teeth is a reduced projective curve of genus 0 (i.e. a curve C with h1(C,OC) = 0) having n + 1 irreducible components over k̄. One component, defined over k, is called the handle. The other n components, [formula] are disjoint from each other and intersect C0 in n distinct points. Every Ci is smooth and rational. The curves [formula] may not be individually defined over k. A comb can be pictured as below:

[formula]

Let X be a smooth projective variety over k and S  ⊂  X a zero-dimensional smooth subset. Set n =  deg S. A k-comb through S is

a k-comb with n teeth [formula],

a k-morphism f:C  →  X, and

a k-morphism [formula] such that [formula], and each Ci,i  ≥  1 contains exactly one point of Sk̄.

Set [formula]. Over a perfect field, a comb through S can also be given by a k-morphism [formula] and a conjugate set of k̄-morphisms [formula], [formula] such that

gi(0:1) = Pi, and

gi(1:0)  =  g0(s(Pi)) for [formula], where [formula] is some embedding.

A family of combs through S parametrized by a scheme T can be identified with n + 1 morphisms

[formula]

with the expected properties.
