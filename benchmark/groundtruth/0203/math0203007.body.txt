On surfaces with pg = 2, q = 1 and non-birational bicanonical map

2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 14J29

Introduction

If a smooth complex surface S of general type has a pencil of curves of genus 2, then the bicanonical map φ of S is not birational. We call this exception to the birationality of the bicanonical map φ the standard case. The classification of the non-standard cases has a long history and we refer to the expository paper [\cite=ci] for information on this problem.

The classification of non-standard irregular surfaces has been first considered by Xiao Gang in [\cite=xiaocan]. He gives a list of numerical possibilities for the invariants of the cases which might occur. More precise results have been obtained in [\cite=cfm], [\cite=ccm] and [\cite=cm].

In this note we prove the following:

Let S be an irregular surface of general type over [formula] with χ(S)  ≥  2 and non-birational bicanonical map. Then S has a pencil of curves of genus 2.

In view of the results contained in the aforementioned papers, in order to prove this theorem, it suffices to exclude the existence of non-standard cases with pg = 2,q = 1. This we will do in § [\ref=theorem] (see theorem [\ref=main]). In § [\ref=preliminar] we prove some vanishing results which we apply later. In §§ [\ref=paracanonical], [\ref=nonbirat] we study the paracanonical system of the surfaces in question, proving a few numerical and geometric properties of it which allow us to prove theorem [\ref=main].

A preliminary result

In this section we prove some results that we will need further on.

Let S be an irregular surface of general type.

If C is a 1-connected curve on S and η∈Pic0(S) is a point such that h1(S,OS(K + η)) = 0, then h1(S,OS(K + η + C))  ≤  1 and equality holds if and only if η|C≃OC.

Furthermore, if h1(S,OS(K + C)) = 0 and h1(S,OS(K + η + C)) = 1, then η is a torsion point of Pic0(S).

Let S be an irregular surface of general type such that either q = 1 or the image of the Albanese map a:S  →  Alb(S) is a surface.

(i) If C is a 1-connected curve on S and η∈Pic0(S) is a general point, then h1(S,OS(K + η + C))  ≤  1.

(ii) If C is a 1-connected curve on S which is not contracted by the Albanese map a:S  →  Alb(S), then h1(S,OS(K + C)) < q and if η∈Pic0(S) is a general point, then h1(S,OS(K + η + C)) = 0.

(iii) If C is a 1-connected curve on S which is contracted by the Albanese map a:S  →  Alb(S), then h1(S,OS(K + C)) = q and if η∈Pic0(S) is a general point, then h1(S,OS(K + η + C)) = 1.

Some properties of the paracanonical curves

Let S be an irregular surface of general type. We denote by K a canonical divisor of S. If η∈Pic0(S) is any point, we will consider the linear system |K + η|. We denote by Cη a curve in |K + η|, called a paracanonical curve of S.

Assume now that pg = 2,q = 1 for S. Then, for a general point η∈Pic0(S), the linear system |K + η| is a pencil. The curves Cη thus describe, for a general point η∈Pic0(S), a continuous system K of dimension 2 of curves on S, called the main paracanonical system of S.

We will write |K + η| = Fη + |Mη|, where F: = Fη is the fixed part and |M|: = |Mη| is the movable part of |K + η|. Next we prove two lemmas about the main paracanonical system.

In the above setting, there is a not empty open Zariski subset U  ⊆  Pic0(S) such that either Fη or |Mη| stays fixed as η varies in U.

Let S be a minimal surface of general type with pg = 2, q = 1, with no pencil of curves of genus 2 and K2  ≤  8. For any η∈Pic0(S) such that h0(S,OS(K + η)) = 2, the general curve in |Mη| is irreducible. Furthermore:

(i) if |Mη| = |M| does not depend on η∈Pic0(S), then either Fη is 1-connected or Fη = Aη + B, where B is a fundamental cycle, A: = Aη is 1-connected, and K2S = 8, KS  ·  M = 4, A  ·  B = 0, K  ·  A = 4, A2 = 2, M  ·  A = M  ·  B = 2;

(ii) if Fη = F does not depend on η∈Pic0(S), then either F = 0, or F  ·  M = 2, F is 1-connected and M2  ≥  4 or K2 = 8, M2 = F  ·  M = 4 and K  ·  F = 0. In this latter case either F is 1-connected or F = A + B with A, B fundamental cycles such that A  ·  B = 0.

Non birationality of the bicanonical map and the paracanonical system

Now we will consider a minimal surface S of general type with pg = 2,q = 1, with non-birational bicanonical map φ, presenting the non-standard case. Notice that, by [\cite=reider] and by proposition 3.1 of [\cite=cm], one has then K2  ≤  8. We also recall the following lemma already contained in [\cite=ccm] (see lemma (2.2) of that paper):

Fix η∈Pic0(S) and let x, y be points on S such that φ(x) = φ(y), with y not lying in the base locus of |K - η|. In particular one may assume that x, y are general points such that φ(x) = φ(y). Then x belongs to a curve Cη in |K + η| if and only if y∈Cη.

Let ν > 1 be the degree of φ. In view of this lemma, φ restricts to the general curve Mη to a map of degree ν to its image. In particular, if φ has degree 2, then the bicanonical involution fixes the curves Mη and therefore also the curves Fη.

Now we are ready for the proof of the following proposition:

Let S be a minimal surface of general type with pg = 2, q = 1, with non-birational bicanonical map, presenting the non-standard case. Then, with the same notation as in lemma [\ref=fm], we have that F = Fη is independent of η∈Pic0(S), and either:

(i) F = 0 or F is 1-connected, strictly contained in a fibre of the Albanese pencil of S and F  ·  M = 2, M2  ≥  4, or;

(ii) F = A + B with A, B fundamental cycles such that A  ·  B = 0 and M2 = F  ·  M = 4, K2 = 8.

In any case for a general η∈Pic0(S), the general curve M∈|Mη| is bielliptic and for a general ε∈Pic0(S), the linear system |Mε| cuts out on M a complete linear series whose movable part is a g14 composed with the bielliptic involution on M.

The bicanonical map has then degree 2 onto its image, and the bicanonical involution ι acts on the general curve M as the bielliptic involution.

Notice that the assertion concerning the degree of the bicanonical map contained in the above proposition, also follows by the results of [\cite=xiaocan].

The main theorem

In this section we will prove the following:

If S is a surface of general type with pg = 2, q = 1, non-birational bicanonical map, then it presents the standard case.

By proposition [\ref=fmmore], if S is a minimal surface of general type with pg = 2, q = 1, such that the bicanonical map is not birational and S presents the non-standard case, then for η∈Pic0(S) a general point, the pencil |K + η| = F + |Mη| has a fixed part F which does not depend on η and a movable part |M| = |Mη| which depends on η. Notice that all components of F sit in fibres of the Albanese pencil.

We let M be the 2-dimensional system of curves which is the closure, in the Hilbert scheme, of the family of curves |Mη|, with η∈Pic0(S) a general point. If we let μ: = M2, then μ  ≥  4 and the general curve M∈M is irreducible. Notice that M has a natural morphism M  →  Pic0(S) whose general fibre is a [formula].

Fix a general point x∈S and set x': = ι(x). Consider the system Mx of curves in M passing through x. We claim that the system Mx is irreducible, of dimension 1, parametrized by Pic0(S). Indeed any irreducible component of Mx has dimension 1 and no irreducible component of Mx can be contained in a fibre of M  →  Pic0(S). Since Mx cuts the general fibre of M  →  Pic0(S) in one point, the claim follows.

Notice that Mx  =  Mx', so it is appropriate to denote this system by Mx,x'.

Let us point out the following corollary of proposition [\ref=fmmore]:

In the above setting, two general curves in M have intersection multiplicity μ - 4 at fixed points of S, and intersect at 4 further distinct variable points, which are pairwise conjugated in the bicanonical involution ι. In particular, given a general point x∈S, two general curves in Mx,x' intersect at 2 distinct variable points, which are conjugated in the bicanonical involution.

Recall that the index of a 1-dimensional system of curves on a surface is the number of curves of the system passing through a general point of the surface. Next we prove the following lemma:

In the above setting, the system Mx,x' has index ν = 2.

Set Pic0(S): = A' and fix x∈S a general point. Another general point y∈S determines two point m1,y,m2,y in A' corresponding to the two curves of Mx,x' containing y. Thus we can consider the map:

[formula]

which takes the general point y∈S to the divisor class of m1,y + m2,y. This map is clearly surjective and it factors through the Albanese map. We denote by G the general fibre of α, which is composed of curves of the Albanese pencil.

We are finally in a position to give the:

Proof of theorem [\ref=main]. Assume S presents the non-standard case. Let us keep the above notation and let us set n: = G  ·  M. By proposition [\ref=fmmore], one has G  ·  K = G  ·  F + G  ·  M = G  ·  M = n. Since we are in the non-standard case, we have n  ≥  4.

Fix a general point x∈X and the system Mx,x'. Let M be a general curve in Mx,x'. Let [formula] consist of the points x1,...,xn. Notice that each of the points x1,...,xn is a general point of S, in particular it is different from x and x'. Let m be the point of A' corresponding to the curve M. By lemma [\ref=index] and by the generality of x1,...,xn, for each i = 1,...,n there is only another curve Mi∈Mx,x', different from M, containing xi. Let mi be the point of A' corresponding to Mi, i = 1,...,n. One has α(xi) = m + mi, i = 1,...,n. On the other hand, by the meaning of G, one has α(x1) = ... = α(xn), i.e. the divisor classes of m + mi on A' are the same for all i = 1,...,n. This implies m1 = ... = mn, i.e. M1 = ... = Mn. Let M' be this curve. Then x1,...,xn sit in the intersection of the two curves M and M' of Mx,x', off the points x,x'. By corollary [\ref=corol] we have n + 2  ≤  4, i.e. n  ≤  2, a contradiction.
