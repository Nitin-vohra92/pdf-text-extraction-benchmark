Abstract

We analyze some aspects of recently performed Franson-type experiments with entangled photon pairs aimed to test Bell's inequalities. We point out that quantum theory leads to the coincidence rate between detectors which includes in fact a dependence on the distance. We study this dependence and obtain that for large distances the correlation function vanishes. Therefore with taking into account the space parts of wave functions of photons for large distances quantum mechanical predictions are consistent with Bell's inequalities. We propose an experimental study of space dependence of correlation functions in  Bell-type experiments.

Introduction

Violation of Bell's inequalities is the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental investigations

[formula]

and others researchers

[formula]

. In this paper we consider the spacetime dependence of correlation functions in Franson-type experiments for entangled states.

Consider a pair of spin one-half particles in the singlet spin state. If we neglect the spacetime dependence of the wave function the quantum mechanical correlation of two spins is

[formula]

Here a and b are two unit vectors in space and  σ = (σ1,σ2,σ3) are the Pauli matrices. Bell's theorem states that  this can not be represented in the form of classical correlation function P(a,b). Bell-Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) form of Bell's inequality of two stochastic processes is

[formula]

From the other hand if [formula] then

[formula]

and Bell's inequality is violated.

Now we suppose that detectors are located in two separated regions [formula]and O2 respectively and perform localized observations. In this case the quantum correlation is

[formula]

Here PO is the projection onto the region O. If the wave function has a special form of the product of the spin part and the space part, ψ  =  ψspinφ(r1,r2) then

[formula]

where the function

[formula]

describes correlation of particles in space. The factor g(O1,O2) is important. We obtain that Bell's inequalities can be violated only if

[formula]

The factor g(O1,O2) deserves an experimental studying. It was shown  in

[formula]

). At time t = 0 an atom is assumed to be excited into the upper state ψ1, which has a relatively long lifetime τ1. After emission of a photon γ1 with wavelength λ1 the atom will be in the intermediate state ψ2, which has a relatively short lifetime τ2  ≪  τ1. Thus a second photon γ2 with wavelength λ2 will be emitted very soon after γ1 and a coincidence counting experiment would show a very narrow peak with a width ~  τ2. Photons γ1and γ2 are collimated by lenses L1 and L2 into beams which propagate toward distant detectors D1 and D2, respectively. The coincidence counting rate will simply show a narrow peak indicating that γ1and γ2 were emitted at times which were the same to within a small uncertainty ~  τ2.

The quantum-mechanical description of this process is highly nonlocal in space since the time at which either photon was emitted was initially uncertain over a much larger time interval ~  τ1. As a result, the two photons must initially be described by wave packets in which their time of emission and thus their position is relatively uncertain. The detection of one of the photons, say γ1, immediately determines the time of emission of the other photon and thus its position to within a much smaller uncertainty, which must be reflected by a nonlocal change in the wave function describing the other photon. This nonlocal reduction of the wave function is analogous to that which occurs in the polarization measurements of Bell's original theorem. The relative phases of the photons play the role of polarization angles in Bell's type experiments.

Correlation function

Let us investigate the dependence on the distance in the coincidence experiment with the half-silvered mirrors in place. To calculate the coincidence rates one introduced

[formula]

ψ (r)= ea(k)dk

[formula]

ψ (r,t)=eψ (r)e

[formula]

ψ (r,t)=ψ (r,t)+eψ (r,t-Δ T)

[formula]

ψ (r,t)=ψ (r,t)+eψ (r,t-Δ T)

[formula]

R=〈 0| ψ (r,t)ψ (r,t)ψ (r,t)ψ (r,t)| 0〉

[formula]

Model

Let us consider the quantum model with the Hamiltonian

[formula]

Here f(k) is a formfactor (test function) and ω(k) is a dispersion low. The field operators (in coordinate representation) are

[formula]

In the Heisenberg representation the states remain constant while the operators evolve in time so that

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Our goal is to study the quantity

[formula]

Using ([\ref=2]) one immediately gets

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Let us consider two cases. The first case the formfactor f(p) has an exponential form and the second case the formfactor has the form of a simple cut-off.

In order to investigate the behavior of φ(r,t) as |r|  →    ∞   let us consider some concrete examples of formfactor and dispersion low. Suppose that our Hamiltonian describes massless particles, i.e. ω(p) = |p|, p∈R3. We will consider two types of formfactor - the step-function and a gaussian formfactor. In both cases formfactor depends only on |p|. Therefore for φ(r,t) one has

[formula]

[formula]

Here we denoted

[formula]

Now we consider the case f(|p|) = θ(|p| - A) where θ is the step function for some positive constant A. We have

[formula]

This means that [formula] vanishes for large |r| at least as 1 / |r|2.

For the gaussian formfactor f(|p|) = e- |p|2 / A the asymptotics has the same form [formula].

This means that R0 polynomially decreases at large distances between detectors.

Moreover one can slightly modify the gaussian formfactor in some neighborhood of p = 0 in such a way that R0 will decrease faster then any polynomial. To obtain such a behaviour just take f(x) to be a test function with a compact support on the positive semiaxis.

Conclusions

In this paper the space dependence of correlation function in Franson-type experiments is discussed. The role of the spacetime dependence of the correlation function in Bell-type experiments was considered earlier in

[formula]

and others researchers) and the form of Rc in Eq. (5) is identical to that obtained in earlier experiments based upon Bell theorem where [formula] and [formula] correspond instead to the orientation of distant polarizers

[formula]

correlation coefficient E is independent of R0 (R0 is canceled out in process of calculation of E) but Larsson et al.

[formula]

. Hence 1 / 2 is a coefficient in left part of Bell inequality and that's why it is not violated. In

[formula]

one proposed to use the visibility V as a coefficient before the function of cosine of phase differences. If V ≤   [formula] then there is no violation of the Bell's inequalities and therefore there is no violation of locality in the corresponding state of wave function. Authors notes that visibility decreased compared to short distance experiments but without obvious visibility dependence on distance. In
