Introduction

The slow dynamics of non-equilibrium systems displays several characteristic features which are absent for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, see [\cite=Bray94] [\cite=Bouc98] [\cite=Cate00] [\cite=Godr01] for reviews. Most notable among these are the break-down of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the aging of the system as conveniently displayed in the two-time autocorrelations and auto-response functions. While these features were first observed in glassy systems, they also occur in simple ferromagnetic spin systems without disorder. The present paper studies such relatively simple non-equilibrium systems.

Usually, the system is prepared in some initial state (a completely disordered initial state of effective infinite temperature is common) and then brought out of equilibrium even at very long times by a rapid quench to some final temperature T which may be below or equal to the critical temperature Tc. The subsequent evolution then takes place at that fixed temperature T. Main observables include the two-time autocorrelation function C(t,s) and the auto-response function R(t,s) where s is the waiting time and t the observation time. A convenient way to characterize the distance of the system from equilibrium is through the fluctuation-dissipation ratio [\cite=Cugl94a] [\cite=Cugl94b] [\cite=Bouc98]

[formula]

At equilibrium, both C and R only depend on the time difference τ = t - s and X = X(τ) = 1. Physically, this is realized if the initial quench was made to some temperature T > Tc. Then for time scales large compared to the (finite) characteristic time scale τeq the system relaxes exponentially fast towards equilibrium.

On the other hand, if either T < Tc or T = Tc, an infinite spin system does not reach equilibrium on some finite time scale but instead undergoes either phase ordering kinetics or non-equilibrium critical dynamics. In both cases, two-time observables such as C = C(t,s) and R = R(t,s) depend on both the waiting time s and the observation time t and not merely on their difference τ = t - s. This breaking of time translation invariance is usally referred to as aging and will be used in this sense from now on. Consequently, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X = X(t,s)  ≠  1 also becomes a non-trivial function of both s and t. Empirically, it is well-established [\cite=Bray94] that the aging process is associated with dynamical scaling, that is in the scaling regime with times 1  ≪  s,τ long enough after the initial quench one finds

[formula]

where a,b are non-equilibrium critical exponents and fC and fR are scaling functions. Here and in the sequel we always have t > s. For large arguments x = t / s  ≫  1, these scaling functions typically behave as

[formula]

where z is the dynamical exponent and λC,λR are the autocorrelation [\cite=Fish88] [\cite=Huse89] and autoresponse exponents. Throughout this paper, we are only interested in this late-time regime where scaling occurs.

Usually, the long-time behaviour after a quench from a completely disordered state is studied. In this case, the available evidence as reviewed in [\cite=Godr01], and based on results notably from the Glauber-Ising model [\cite=Godr00a] [\cite=Lipp00] and the spherical model with a non-conserved order parameter [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Godr00b] is consistent with the autocorrelation and autoreponse exponents being equal, λC  =  λR, and, for a quench exactly onto criticality T = Tc, with the additional relation a = b. However, exceptions to this rule exist. Consider the 2D XY model with a fully ordered zero-temperature initial state and quenched 'upwards' to some temperature T < TKT, where TKT is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature. A recent calculation by Berthier, Holdsworth and Sellitto [\cite=Bert01] based on the spin-wave approximation has produced analytical results for both the autocorrelation and autoresponse scaling functions fC(x) and fR(x) and found the scaling "in complete agreement with the results obtained by Godrèche and Luck [\cite=Godr00b] for the spherical model at the critical point" [\cite=Bert01]. Indeed one has a = b = η / 2, where η  =  η(T) is the usual static (and temperature-dependent) critical exponent, but the autocorrelation exponent λC / z = η / 4 and the autoresponse exponent λR / z = 1 + η / 4 [\cite=Bert01] are different from each other. We therefore ask ourselves what may generically become of the relation between λC and λR for more general initial states than fully disordered or fully ordered ones. Beyond a case study in a given model, this allows a test of the generic scaling and universality properties as reviewed abvoe and should provide useful insight. The rôle of the initial conditions on aging in spin-glasses has been and continues to be actively studied, see [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Zote02] and references therein.

Questions of this sort are best addressed first in some non-trivial exactly solvable model before being studied further through simulations. We shall therefore examine for the kinetic spherical model described by a non-conserved Langevin equation (see section 2 for precise definitions) the rôle of long-range correlations in the initial state which are characterized by a power law for the Fourier transformation [formula] of the spin-spin correlator, in the low-momentum limit [formula]

[formula]

and we shall study how the above scaling forms are affected, if at all, by varying α. We can therefore interpolate between a disordered initial state with α = 0 and a fully ordered state (α =  - d) as considered in [\cite=Bert01]. While much is already known for T < Tc [\cite=Bray91], we shall see that for T = Tc there occur several new regimes for the long-time aging behaviour which depend on the value of α. Our calculations suggest the new scaling relation λC  =  λR  +  αeff where αeff  =  αeff(α) is the effective value of α which actually describes the long-time behaviour. We shall show that this also explains the results obtained in the 2D XY model [\cite=Bert01] and referred to above.

Furthermore, introducing a new parameter into the kinetics permits an instructive test of the assertion by Godrèche and Luck [\cite=Godr00b] that the limit fluctuation-dissipation ratio

[formula]

is a universal number and we shall indeed confirm this universality (see section 3).

Finally, we recall that recently the precise form of the autoresponse function R(t,s) was derived from conformal invariance [\cite=Henk99], for [formula] being inside the scaling regime [\cite=Henk01] [\cite=Henk02]

[formula]

where r0 is a normalization constant. As we shall see in section 4, this functional form is indeed recovered, but the exponents a and λR will be functions of α.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In the next section, to give a self-contained presentation, we recall the main steps of the general formalism for the exact calculation of correlation and response functions. In section 3, we analyse these in the scaling limit where aging occurs and find the scaling functions fC(x) and fR(x) as functions of the initial conditions characterized by the parameter α. In section 4, the physical conclusions from these calculations are drawn. In the appendix, we shall briefly present some results on initial conditions in the 1D Glauber-Ising model such that the mean magnetization is non-vanishing.

Formalism

We now describe the calculation of the two-time autocorrelation and autoresponse functions in the exactly solvable spherical model in d spatial dimensions, for arbitrary initial conditions. Our calculation follows closely the standard lines established several times in the past, see [\cite=Bray91] [\cite=Jans89] [\cite=Newm90] [\cite=Kiss93] [\cite=Coni94] [\cite=Cala02] for continuum field theories and [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Zipp00] [\cite=Godr00b] [\cite=Cann01] [\cite=Corb02] for lattice models. The effects of specific initial conditions on the long-time behaviour and aging will be analysed in the next section.

The spherical model is defined in terms of real spin variables [formula] attached to the sites of a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice and subject to the constraint

[formula]

where N is the total number of sites, and the usual spin Hamiltonian [formula] where the sum extends over nearest neighbour pairs only. The (non-conserved) dynamics is given by the stochastic Langevin equation

[formula]

where [formula] are the nearest neighbour sites of the site [formula], the Gaussian white noise [formula] has the correlation

[formula]

and [formula] is determined by satisfying the spherical constraint ([\ref=2:SpCon]) in the mean. By a Fourier transformation

[formula]

where the integral is over the first Brillouin zone B, eq. ([\ref=2:eqMot]) is transformed into

[formula]

where in addition, together with the [formula] limit

[formula]

The formal solution is [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Godr00b]

[formula]

which forms the basis for all subsequent calculations.

The Lagrange multiplier g(T,t) is determined from the spherical constraint and the initial conditions. To see this, consider the equal-time spin-spin correlation function

[formula]

where spatial translation invariance is already taken into account. Here and in the sequel, the brackets denote the average over the ensemble of the initial conditions and over the thermal histories, i.e. the realizations of the noise [formula]. The spherical constraint ([\ref=2:SpCon]) implies that

[formula]

In Fourier space the equal-time correlator [formula] is obtained from

[formula]

and is given by

[formula]

From the spherical constraint ([\ref=2:SpCon2]) we have in Fourier space that [formula] and this leads to the following Volterra integral equation for g(T,t), see [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Godr00b]

[formula]

where the two auxiliary functions f(t) and A(t) are defined as follows

[formula]

and where I0 is a modified Bessel function [\cite=Abra65]. The solution of equation ([\ref=2:Volt]) is found from a Laplace transformation

[formula]

and is given by

[formula]

Therefore the entire evolution of the system, starting from a freely chosen initial condition, can be described in terms of the properties of the functions f(t) and A(t). In particular, the initial state is characterized exclusively by the initial correlator [formula] and these data enter explicitly only into the function A(t). The simplest case may be considered to be an initial state without any correlations. Then [formula], therefore [formula] and thus A(t) = f(t). This case has been analysed in great detail, see [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Zipp00] [\cite=Corb02] and in particular [\cite=Godr00b].

We postpone the analysis of the effects of initial conditions given by [formula] to the next section and now give the general expressions for the two-time correlators and the two-time response functions. The two-time correlation function is defined as

[formula]

where s is the waiting time, t the observation time and t  ≥  s  ≥  0 always. In Fourier space, it is easy to see that

[formula]

and where the expression ([\ref=2:Ctt]) for the single-time correlator has been used. Below, we shall be mainly be interested in the two-time autocorrelation

[formula]

which we shall analyse in the next section. The response function is obtained in the usual way [\cite=Newm90] [\cite=Kiss93] [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Godr00b] by adding a small magnetic field term [formula] to the Hamiltonian. This leads to an extra term [formula] on the right-hand side of the Langevin equation ([\ref=2:eqMot]). Provided that causality and spatial translation invariance hold, we have to first order

[formula]

which defines the (linear) response function [formula]. The calculation is completely standard [\cite=Newm90] [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Godr00b] and we merely quote the result

[formula]

Again, we shall be mainly concerned with the autoresponse function

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=2:Ctt],[\ref=2:Cts],[\ref=2:Rts]) give the single-time correlation function and the two-time autocorrelation and autoresponse functions, respectively, for yet arbitrary initial conditions. Together with the spherical constraint ([\ref=2:Volt]), which fixes the function g(T,t) in terms of the auxiliary functions f(t) and A(t), these are the main results of this section.

Analysis

It is our aim to consider the effects of long-range correlations in the initial state on the long-time and aging behaviour of the model. For the long-time behaviour, only the low-momentum regime should be relevant, which we take to be of the form [\cite=Bray91]

[formula]

where α is a free parameter and c0,cα are normalization constants. For α > 0, the long-time behaviour depends to leading order only on the first term while for α < 0, we have effetively c0 = 0, to leading order. For the purposes of this paper, namely the study of the rôle of long-range correlations in the initial conditions as parametrized by α, it is sufficient to study the case c0 = 0, which we shall assume from now on. For α < 0, this corresponds to initial correlations of the form [formula] for large distances [formula]. This initial condition should lead to the following t  →    ∞   asymptotics of the auxiliary function

[formula]

The case without initial correlations considered previously [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Zipp00] [\cite=Godr00b] [\cite=Corb02] corresponds to [formula] and is recovered if we formally set α = 0. Any differences between the scaling behaviour coming from the initial conditions ([\ref=3:Ini]) and for those analysed previously must related to a different long-time behaviour of the functions A(t) and f(t) (it is well known that for t large, one has f(t)≃(8πt)- d / 2). It is the purpose of this section to carry through the technical analysis and especially to obtain the explicit scaling functions for the autocorrelation, autoresponse and the fluctuation-dissipation ratio. The physical discussion of the results will be presented in section 4.

The single-time correlator [formula] has been analysed in great detail by Coniglio, Ruggiero and Zanetti [\cite=Coni94] in the context of coarse-grained field theory.

We now analyse the long-time behaviour of the two-time correlators and response functions. For the questions we are interested in, namely the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and/or aging effects, it is enough to restrict to temperatures at or below criticality. Indeed, for T > Tc, the system will simply relax to equilibrium within a finite time scale τeq  ~  (T - Tc)- 2ν, where ν is the known equilibrium correlation length exponent, see [\cite=Godr00b] and references therein. For the same reason, we restrict to d > 2 throughout such that there is always a phase transition at a non-vanishing critical temperature Tc > 0. In addition, the early stages of the evolution of the system (notably the evolution of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio) will depend on whether the system was initially prepared in an equilibrium state or not but this information requires more knowledge on the initial state than merely its low-momentum behaviour eq. ([\ref=3:Ini]). Rather, the behaviour we are interested in is described by the scaling or aging limit which is reached when both the waiting time s and the observation time t become simultaneously large, that is 1  ≪  s  ~  t - s. As we shall be interested in the scaling properties of C(t,s) and R(t,s), it is useful to work with the dimensionless scaling variable

[formula]

Taking the scaling limit t,s  →    ∞   with x fixed, it is convenient to rewrite the results ([\ref=2:Cts],[\ref=2:Rts]) of the previous section as follows

[formula]

where we have neglected correction terms to the leading scaling behaviour. Next, we need the leading behaviour of g(T,t) for t large.

Non-equilibrium critical dynamics

We first consider the case when T = Tc, the equilibrium critical temperature. In general, we expect the leading asymptotics of g(T,t) to be of the form

[formula]

where the dependence of ψ  =  ψ(α,d) must be calculated and g0 is a constant. We determine ψ by finding first from eq. ([\ref=2:Lapg]) the low-p behaviour of [formula], which in turn is given by the small-p behaviours of [formula] and [formula]. These may be found from the integral representations ([\ref=2:fA]) using well-established techniques [\cite=Mont65] [\cite=Godr00b]. At the critical point, the results are as follows:

[formula]

where Tc  =  1 / (2A1) is the equilibrium critical temperature and [formula], [formula] which exist for d > 2k. Similarly, we find

[formula]

where aα is given in eq. ([\ref=3:Aa]) and [formula] which exists for d + α > 2 (if either d = 2,4 or d + α = 0,2 additional logarithmic factors will be present, which we shall discard throughout). From this, [formula] follows and transforming back to g(T,t), the exponent ψ(α,d) describing the leading behaviour for t large is found. We collect the results in table [\ref=tab1] and identify five regimes where the behaviour of g(T,t) is different. It is convenient to characterize these regimes in terms of an effective dimension

[formula]

the meaning of which we shall discuss in section 4. From these results, we find the following scaling forms

[formula]

where the values of the exponent φ = 1 + ψ  +  α / 2 are also listed in table [\ref=tab1] and

[formula]

Furthermore, the scaling of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio can be written in the form

[formula]

where the functions M(x) and K(x) are defined by

[formula]

and we see that the scaling of C(t,s) and consequently of X(t,s) depends on the sign of φ. For that reason, the regimes IV and V have to be distinguished.

We can now list the scaling functions for both the autocorrelation and autoresponse functions

[formula]

together with the fluctuation-dissipation ratio. The results for the exponents a and b are given in table [\ref=tab2] below. For the response function, the scaling function simply is in all five regimes

[formula]

and the values of ψ can be read off from table [\ref=tab1]. We shall return to this result in section 4.

The functions fC(x) and X(t,s) are listed below: for regime I, we find

[formula]

The fluctuation dissipation ratio becomes in the scaling limit a function of x only, which reads for α  ≠   - 2

[formula]

together with the leading behaviour for infinitely separated timescales x  →    ∞  . For α =  - 2, we find

[formula]

Therefore, if α  ≠   - 2, the limit fluctuation-dissipation ratio has the universal value X∞ = 0 but the approach towards that limit does depend on the initial condition, while for α =  - 2, we have X∞ = 1 signalling that an equilibrium state will be reached.

The behaviour of the scaling function X(x) is illustrated in figure [\ref=Abb2]. In the left part (figure [\ref=Abb2]a) we consider initial states with α  ≥   - 2 which are more disordered than the critical equilibrium state. In all cases, one starts from equilibrium at equal times, since X(1) = 1. If α  ≠   - 2, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio decays with x increasing. However, if α approaches the border between regions I and region III, the scaling function X(I)(x) obtained for the region I goes over smoothly into the one found for region III. Close to that boundary, quite large values of x are needed in order to distinguish these functions. On the other hand, for α =  - 2, the long-range properties of the initial state are the same as for the equilibrium state. Although the system departs initially from equilibrium, since X(x) > 1, the non-equilibrium short-range correlations are succesively equilibrated and the system finally arrives at the equilibrium value of the limit fluctuation-dissipation ratio X∞ = 1. If we now consider the case α  ≤   - 2 (figure [\ref=Abb2]b) with an initial state more ordered than the equilibrium state, the behaviour is completely different. Starting from X(1) = 1, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio increases with x and encounters at some finite value xs = xs(d,α) a singularity. For x > xs, it is negative and rapidly decays to zero with increasing x.

For regime II, we find

[formula]

where the integral A2 was defined in section 3. Therefore for any value of x, X(xs,s) = 0 in the scaling limit s  →    ∞  , since d > 4 here.

For regime III, we have

[formula]

which reproduces the scaling functions previously found [\cite=Godr00b] for α = 0. The entire scaling functions turn out to be completely independent of α. Therefore, the scaling behaviour in this region is governed by the effective value αeff = 0 in the initial condition ([\ref=3:Ini]) and all scaling functions are universal. In particular, the limit fluctuation-dissipation ratio X∞  =   lim x  →    ∞X(x) = 1 - 2 / d is a universal number, as expected.

We have for the case of regime IV

[formula]

which again agrees completely with the earlier results found for α = 0 [\cite=Godr00b]. Again, the scaling functions are independent of α and thus αeff = 0. In particular X∞ = 1 / 2 is a universal number.

Finally, in the regime V, we find

[formula]

where the constant BV is given by

[formula]

Therefore X(xs,s) = 0 in the scaling limit, since 1 + α / 2 < 0.

From the x  →    ∞   asymptotics

[formula]

and the known fact that z = 2 [\cite=Bray94] for the spherical model at and below Tc, we read off the critical autocorrelation and autoresponse exponents λC and λR and collect the results in table [\ref=tab2]. They will be discussed in section 4.

Phase ordering

Having found the scaling behaviour at criticality, we now turn to the ordered phase, where T < Tc. This case was considered long ago in the context of the coarse-grained O(n)-symmetric field theory in the limit n  →    ∞   [\cite=Bray91] [\cite=Newm90]. The relations ([\ref=3:CRtsSkal]) remain valid, but the Lagrange multiplier g(T,t) now has for large times the leading behaviour

[formula]

where M2eq = 1 - T / Tc is the squared equilibrium magnetization. In the scaling limit s  →    ∞  , t  →    ∞   but x = t / s fixed, one has for α  ≤  0

[formula]

For α = 0, these results were already known [\cite=Newm90] [\cite=Godr00b] [\cite=Corb02] (for α > 0, the constant term in ([\ref=3:Ini]) is dominating the long-time behaviour). As expected, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X = 0 in the scaling limit. The scaling functions fC(x) and fR(x) are defined as

[formula]

and we obtain

[formula]

and formally b = 0 if we were to compare with the scaling ([\ref=3:fcfr]) at criticality. From these, using again eq. ([\ref=3:fasymp]), we have the autocorrelation and autoresponse exponents

[formula]

These results, valid for T < Tc, supplement those for the critical case T = Tc given in table [\ref=tab2]. For arbitrary α < 0 the value of λC was already known [\cite=Bray91]. A long time ago, Newman and Bray [\cite=Newm90] studied the case of zero waiting time s = 0. From eqs ([\ref=2:Cts],[\ref=2:Rts]) and the initial condition g(T,0) = 1, one has

[formula]

in full agreement with their results.

Discussion

The long-time behaviour of the kinetic spherical model depends on the spatial dimension d and the parameter α which charcaterizes the initial condition eq. ([\ref=3:Ini]). We have already introduced the effective dimension D, see eq. ([\ref=3:D]). In terms of these, the equilibrium correlation function [formula] at criticality and the initial correlation function [formula] scale for large distances [formula] as

[formula]

(since the equilibrium critical exponent η = 0 for the sperical model). Therefore, we have studied the influence of the fluctuations of an effectively D-dimensional system onto a model defined in d dimensions. We can conclude:

In the scaling limit which describes the aging of the system, the results obtained for a quench to a temperature T < Tc below the critical point and given in eqs. ([\ref=3:Tbas1],[\ref=3:Tbas2]) show that the effect of initial long-range correlations persists for all times of the ongoing non-equilibrium behaviour, but without provoking any qualitative changes, as observed long ago [\cite=Newm90] [\cite=Bray91]. Remarkably enough, however, for times 1  ≪  t - s  ≪  s which in the scaling limit corresponds to x≃1 and for any initial condition, the two-time autocorrelations saturate at a plateau value C(x = 1)≃M2eq, see eq. ([\ref=3:CRXbas]). For larger differences between the waiting time s and the observation time t, C(t,s) decays to zero according to a power law which now again depends on the initial conditions and the systems shows thus a sort of memory of its initial state.

Surprisingly, the results for a quench precisely to T = Tc are qualitatively different. They are collected in tables [\ref=tab1] and [\ref=tab2] and the resulting phase diagram is shown in figure [\ref=Abb1]. Indeed, we find five regimes with different aging behaviours. These regimes are distinguished by the presence (when 2 < d < 4 and/or 2 < D < 4) of strong critical fluctuations in either the equilibrium or the initial state, respectively, or else their absence (when d > 4 and/or D > 4) when either the equilibrium or the initial state are in the mean field regime. In addition, if both d > 4 and D > 4, it is of relevance whether the initial correlations decay faster than those in the equilibrium state or not. If d = D, the system is prepared in its critical equilibrium state, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is valid and no aging occurs. That is the situation of equilibrium critical dynamics. Specifically, we find

Only if the initial correlations are in the mean field regime, i.e. D > 4, and if in addition the initial correlations decay faster than in equilibrium, the system may show a non-vanishing value of the fluctuation-dissipation ration X∞. In these cases (regimes III/IV), the entire scaling functions fC(x), fR(x) and X(x) do not depend of the initial conditions at all and agree with the previously known results obtained for a disordered initial state of infinite temperature, see [\cite=Cugl95] [\cite=Godr00b] [\cite=Corb02]. One therefore has effective initial conditions such that αeff = 0. That finding is in full agreement with the expected [\cite=Godr00b] [\cite=Godr01] universality of these scaling functions and of X∞ in particular.

A non-trivial result for the scaling of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X(x) is found if both the equilibrium and the initial states are fluctuation-dominated (regime I). The limit value for very large separations x = t / s  →    ∞   between the waiting time s and the observation time t is the universal value X∞ = 0, provided that α  ≠   - 2, but the approach towards this limit depends on the initial condition through X(x)  ~  x- |α| / 2, as was illustrated in figure [\ref=Abb2]. It is not impossible that the rather trivial value X∞ = 0 which is more typical of a low-temperature phase might be a peculiarity of the spherical model. On the other hand, if α =  - 2, then X∞ = 1 and the system evolves towards equilibrium.

If the equilibrium state is in the mean field regime and if in addition the initial correlations decay slower than in equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X vanishes in the scaling limit, independently of the value of x = t / s (regimes II/V). Despite of having fixed the temperature at its critical value, this behaviour is typical for a quench into the low-temperature ordered phase.

It would be of interest to see whether a similar variety of different types of non-equilibrium critical dynamics may be established for different spin systems (especially with z  ≠  2) and in particular, whether the rôle of the equilibrium and/or the initial state being in the mean-field regime can be confirmed. As a preparation for this we briefly treat in the appendix an example where the mean magnetization does not vanish.

Turning to the values of the autocorrelation exponent λC and the autoresponse exponent λR, we find that one of the following two scenarios is realized: either (i) the two exponents are equal

[formula]

which occurs at criticality in the regimes III and IV characterized by αeff = 0 and where also X∞  ≠  0 or else (ii) they satisfy the relation

[formula]

which is realized in the entire ordered phase and for the critical regimes I, II and V, where αeff  =  α and X∞ = 0. As an extreme case, this also includes a completely ordered initial state, where [formula] which corresponds to α =  - d. Up to eventual logarithmic corrections, this case may be included by taking the limit D  →  2 + .

We point out that the results λC / z = η / 4 and λR / z = 1 + η / 4 obtained for the 2D XY model [\cite=Bert01] for a fully ordered initial state (therefore α =  - d =  - 2) in the low-temperature phase are consistent with eq. ([\ref=4:lClRa]), since z = 2 in that model. Indeed, the behaviour of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X2D  XY(x) of the 2D XY model is quite analogous to the one found here for the spherical model in regime I at criticality. In figure [\ref=Abb2]b we show the fluctuation-dissipation ratio of the 2D XY model when starting form a fully ordered initial state

[formula]

which is valid in the entire low-temperature phase, using the spin-wave approximation [\cite=Bert01]. The similarity with the functions X(x) of the spherical model in regime I with α <  - 2 is evident.

Therefore, we conjecture that the relationship between λC and λR is in general given by eq. ([\ref=4:lClRa]) and that only in those special cases where αeff = 0 applies these two exponents happen to be equal. That was indeed the case in all models reviewed in [\cite=Godr01]. Tests of the conjectured scaling relation ([\ref=4:lClRa]) in other models would be most welcome.

Similarly, the usual anticipation, see e.g. [\cite=Godr01], that at criticality the two exponents a = b = 2β  /  νz, where β and ν are standard equilibrium critical exponents, can be checked through the entries of table [\ref=tab2]. It appears again more as a property of certain initial conditions than as a generally valid statement. From table [\ref=tab2], a = b appears to hold whenever X(t,s) does not vanish identically for all x in the scaling limit. In these cases the proposed relationship to the exponents β,ν,z seems rather to be a hyperscaling relation since it does not hold in regime IV.

Having examined the asymptotic properties of the scaling functions fC(x) and fR(x) for x large, we now turn to their functional form for finite values of x. Indeed, as already mentioned in the introduction, conformal invariance predicts that the scaling function of the autoresponse function should be given by [\cite=Henk01] [\cite=Henk02]

[formula]

That prediction can be tested by comparing with the exact result ([\ref=3:fRskal]) for a critical quench and with ([\ref=3:Tbas1]) for a quench into the orderd phase. Inserting the values of the exponents a and λR which can be read from table [\ref=tab2] and from eqs. ([\ref=3:Tbas1],[\ref=3:Tbas2]), respectively, show perfect agreement, both below criticality and at criticality for all five aging regimes.

In addition, we may also test the full space-time dependent response function. Since the dynamical exponent z = 2 in our model, conformal invariance predicts for z = 2 [\cite=Henk01] [\cite=Henk94]

[formula]

where spatial translation invariance is already taken into accout, the autoresponse function R(t,s) is given as before by eq. ([\ref=1:ConfR]) and M is a non-universal and dimensionful constant. To check this, we calculate the full response function from eq. ([\ref=2:Rqts]). In the scaling limit we are interested in, where both t,s as well as their difference t - s become simulataneously large, we may use the q  →  0 limit ([\ref=2:omega-eta]) in the integral

[formula]

and it is easy to see that the resulting gaussian integrals reproduce eq. ([\ref=4:Rfull]) exactly, with M = 1 / 2.

This suggests that the presence of conformal invariance in aging systems should be independent of spatially long-ranged correlations in the initial state. Further tests of conformal invariance in different aging systems with spatially long-range initial conditions are called for.

Summarising, the study of the influence of spatially long-range correlations in the initial state on the long-time behaviour of two-time observables of the exactly solvable spherical model has led us to the recognition of several new types of non-equilibrium critical dynamics in that model. As a consequence, we could formulate the conjecture eq. ([\ref=4:lClRa]) on the relationship between the autocorrelation exponent λC and the autoresponse exponent λR. Finally, the hypothesis of conformal invariance in aging ferromagnetic systems could be tested in a new way.

Appendix. Some remarks on the 1D Glauber-Ising model

Here we consider briefly some non fully disordered initial conditions in the 1D kinetic Ising model with Glauber [\cite=Glau63] dynamics. The Hamiltonian is on a chain of N sites with periodic boundary conditions

[formula]

where σi  =    ±  1 are the Ising spins. The dynamics may be given through the heat bath rule, which gives the probability of finding the spin variables σi(t + 1) in terms of those at time t

[formula]

Here we consider the following initial conditions in terms of the spin-spin correlator [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is the initial averaged magnetization. This allows a simple case study of situations where the mean magnetization [formula] does not vanish. Here and in the sequel spatial translation invariance is already taken into account. We study the long-time evolution of the 1D model after a quench to zero temperature at time t = 0.

The exact solution of the model is closely parallel to the standard lines as presented for the special case M0 = 0 in [\cite=Godr00a] [\cite=Lipp00]. We shall therefore merely state our results. First, the mean magnetization [formula] does remain constant for all times t. We are interested in the connected autocorrelation function Γ(t,s) and the autoresponse function R(t,s) defined as

[formula]

where [formula] is an external magnetic field at the site [formula].

In 1D, we find in the scaling limit t,s  →    ∞   but with x = t / s > 1 fixed

[formula]

and the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X(t,s)  =  R(t,s)(∂Γ(t,s) / ∂s)- 1 becomes a function of x only and reads X(t,s) = X(x) = (x + 1) / 2x. Up to the prefactor [formula], the results for Γ(t,s) and R(t,s) (and therefore also for X(x)) are exactly the same as found in [\cite=Godr00a] [\cite=Lipp00] for the autocorrelation and autoreponse functions at M0 = 0. Therefore, unless M0 = 1 and the system is prepared in a zero-temperature equilibrium state, the exponent α introduced in the text takes the value αeff = 0 here. That agrees with the fact that the autocorrelation and autoresponse exponents are equal, λC  =  λR = 1.

It would be interesting to study the effects of non fully disordered initial conditions in wider settings, e.g. in higher dimensions, conserved order parameters and so on. Acknowledgements
