On the rotating doubly connected patches

On rotating doubly connected vortices

Introduction

The motion of an incompressible ideal fluid with constant density is described by the Euler equations where [formula], T > 0, denotes the velocity field of the fluid particles and the scalar function P stands for the pressure. The incompressibility condition is an immediate consequence of the continuity equation when the density is assumed to be constant. The mathematical theory for this classical system is very reach. Many results were devoted to the local well-posedness problem in different function spaces. Roughly speaking, it is well-known that the Cauchy problem is locally well-posed if the initial velocity is above the scaling of C1 functions, for example, if [formula]. For more details about this we refer the reader to [\cite=BM] [\cite=Ch] [\cite=Kato] and the references therein. Whether these solutions develop singularities in finite time is still an open problem, apparently very difficult. In dimension 2 global regularity was proved long ago [\cite=Wolib] and extensions to the context of axisymmetric flows without swirl were obtained in [\cite=Uk]. In these cases the global existence follows from a special structure of the vorticity, which yields some strong conservation laws.

In this paper we shall focus on the vorticity dynamics in the plane. In this case the vorticity can be identified with the scalar function ω  =  ∂1u2  -  ∂2u1 and its evolution is governed by the transport equation

[formula]

which amounts to saying that vorticity is conserved along particle trajectories. This yields the conservation laws

[formula]

The preservation of vorticity along trajectories allows to go beyond the limitations inherent to the general theory of the hyperbolic systems and to show existence and uniqueness of a global weak solution under the assumption that [formula]. This remarkable result was proved by Yudovich in [\cite=Y1]. Uniqueness follows from the fact that the gradient of the velocity belongs to all Lp spaces and its Lp norm obeys the slow growth condition

[formula]

This framework offers new perspectives for study and allows for example to deal rigorously with vortex patch structures in which the vorticity takes finitely many values over a bounded region. More precisely, we say that the initial vorticity is a patch if it takes a non-zero constant value c0 on a bounded domain D and vanishes elsewhere. In fact, we normalize so that c0 = 1 and the initial vorticity is the characteristic function of the domain D. Since vorticity is preserved on particle trajectories, it can be recovered by the formula

[formula]

where ψ is the flow associated with the velocity field u, that is, the solution of the ODE

[formula]

Remark that a vortex patch can be seen as a desingularization of a point vortex and provides a suitable mathematical model to study the effects of finite vortex cores.

In the vortex patch problem the dynamics of the vorticity is reduced to the motion of the one-dimensional boundary curve ∂Dt according to the nonlocal equation

[formula]

which is referred to in the literature as the contour dynamics equation. The problem of global existence of smooth solutions to the contour dynamics equation was solved by Chemin in [\cite=Ch] (see [\cite=BC] for a short proof). He proved that if the initial boundary ∂D belongs to the Hölder class Cs,1 < s < 2, then the boundary ∂Dt remains in the same class for any positive time. In particular, singularities like corners or cusps cannot appear in finite time if the boundary of the initial domain D is smooth.

In general, the motion of the boundary of the patch is extremely complex, due to the nonlinear effects of the induced velocity. There is in the literature only one explicit solution in the simply connected case (that is, the case in which D is a simply connected domain). It is the Kirchhoff elliptical vortex, in which D is an ellipse with semi-axes a and b. The motion of this vortex patch is simply a rotation around the center of mass of D with angular velocity [formula] When a = b one obtains the circular steady solution known as the Rankine vortex. See [\cite=BM] [\cite=Kirc] [\cite=L].

The behavior of elliptical patches in an external field was first studied by Chaplygin in [\cite=Chapl] for a pure shear. He proved that the vortex retains its elliptical shape, rotates with variable angular velocity and pulsates according to a certain law. This result was extended by Kida [\cite=Kida] and Neu [\cite=Neu] for a uniform straining field and it was found that the vortex exhibits various types of motion depending on the magnitudes of the strain. For example, for weaker straining field the vortex can rotate or nutate. However, for strong strain the vortex elongates indefinitely. Comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the analytical techniques are provided in [\cite=New] [\cite=Saf].

A vortex patch that rotates, like the Kirchhoff ellipses, is called a rotating vortex patch or a V-state (for vortex state). This terminology was introduced by Deem and Zabusky in [\cite=DZ], where the contour dynamics equation [\eqref=contour] was solved numerically to show existence of V-states having an m-fold symmetry for any m = 2,3,... (m = 2 are the Kirchhoff ellipses). The reader is urged to consult [\cite=WOZ] where pictures of m-fold symmetric V-states and their "limiting" shapes are shown. A rigorous study including a proof of existence of non circular m-fold symmetric V-states was peformed by Burbea in [\cite=B]. He used conformal mappings combined with a bifurcation analysis. The authors showed recently in [\cite=HMV] that close to the circle of bifurcation the V-states are convex and have C∞ boundaries. Global bifurcation in this context has not been studied.

The evolution of a system of N disjoint patches is in general very complicated to analyze and each individual patch varies in response to the self-induced velocity field and to that of other patches. Thus it seems to be very difficult to find explicit solutions as for the single rotating patches. The most common approximate model used to track the vortex dynamics is the moment model of Melander, Zabusky and Styczek [\cite=Mela] leading to a self-consistent system of ordinary differential equations governing the local geometric moments. Its truncated model is highly effective to treat. For example, the interaction between several Kirchhoff ellipses which are far apart can be dealt with. For a valuable discussion about this subject see [\cite=New]. A general review about vortex dynamics can be found in [\cite=A].

The main goal of this paper is to study the rigid-body motion (that is, rotation with constant angular velocity) for a linear superposition of finitely many increasing patches. For the sake of clarity and simplicity we only deal with the case of two bounded simply connected domains D2 and D1 such that the closure of D2 is contained in D1. The initial vorticity is of the form

[formula]

so that the parameter α represents the magnitude of the initial vorticity in the interior domain D2. Clearly the initial vorticity is 1 on [formula] and 0 off D1. By the conservation of vorticity along trajectories the vorticity ωt at time t is of the form

[formula]

for some domains D1t and D2t. We say that the solution ωt of [\eqref=vorts1] with initial datum [\eqref=exp] rotates uniformly if ωt is a uniform rotation of the initial vorticity, namely where

[formula]

is the center of mass of ω0 and Ω is some real number that has to be found. The problem we consider consists in finding the couples of domains D1 and D2 such that the multi-vortex ωt rotates. Notice that for α = 0 we are considering an initial doubly connected vortex patch [formula] and we are asking under what conditions this patch rotates uniformly (around its center of mass). The question was raised by Luis Vega and was the initial motivation for this work. An annulus is the only known explicit solution of the doubly connected vortex patch problem.

When the domains are confocal ellipses Flierl and Polvani found in [\cite=Flierl] the complete solutions to this problem by using elliptical coordinates. In that work the authors dealt with finitely many ellipses and special attention was devoted to the stability condition in the case of two confocal ellipses, thus generalizing the known result of Love for the Kirchhoff elliptical vortex.

It seems that no other explicit solutions of the form under consideration can be found in the literature. The aim in this paper is to solve completely the problem of the rigid-body motion in the particular case when the interior interface ∂D2 is an ellipse. We shall prove that under this constraint the vortices of Flierl and Polvani are the only solutions. Our first result concerns Rankine vortices and reads as follows. Let Γj  =  ∂Dj,  j = 1,2.

Accordingly, if one of the curves is a circle and the second one is not then there is no rotation and the dynamics of the vorticity is not easy to track.

The second result deals with the generalized Kirchhoff vortices. Before stating it we need to introduce a piece of notation. For an ellipse with semi-axes a and b define

[formula]

Before giving a brief account of the proofs some remarks are in order. We present now an outline of the proofs of our two results. We first derive the equations governing the motion of the boundaries in the general framework considered here. The uniform rotation condition is shown to be equivalent to a system of two steady nonlocal equations of nonlinear type coupling the Cauchy transforms of the domains D1 and D2. It is hopeless to solve completely this system because of its higher degree of complexity. Nevertheless, when the interior boundary Γ2 is an ellipse we obtain an explicit formula for the Cauchy transform of the unknown domain D1. This leads to an inverse problem of the following type: one knows the Cauchy transform of a domain and one wants to determine the domain. It is well-known that this is not always possible [\cite=Var]. It is, however, possible in our special situation by using Schwarz functions and the maximum principle for harmonic functions. Once we know that Γ1 is an ellipse we come back to the system in order to find the compatibility conditions which will in turn fix all the involved parameters.

The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we gather some general facts about rotating vortices. In section 3 we derive the equations of motion of the boundaries via the Cauchy transforms of the domains D1 and D2. In section 4 we review some useful tools from complex analysis and potential theory and we discuss some inverse problems. The last section is devoted to the proofs of the main results.

Preliminaries on rotating vortices

In this section we discuss some elementary facts on vortex dynamics for incompressible Euler equations. Recall that vorticity ω  =  ∂1v2  -  ∂2v1 satisfies the transport equation [\eqref=vorts1].

We shall focus on the vortices whose dynamics undergoes a planar rigid-body motion. In this case the motion can be described by a combination of translations and rotations. For the sake of simplicity we restrict the study to the group of rotations. In the vortex patch class this definition reduces to the following: ω0  =  χD, with D a bounded domain, is a rotating vorticity (or, equivalently, D is a rotating vortex patch or V-state) if and only if

[formula]

In the preceding definition the vorticity ω0 is assumed to be bounded and integrable in order to get a unique global solution according to Yudovich's theorem. The velocity dynamics in the framework of rotating vortices is described as follows.

Let ω0 be a rotating vorticity as in Definition [formula]. Then the velocity v(t) can be recovered from the initial velocity v0 according to the formula

[formula]

We shall use the formula

[formula]

Performing some algebraic computations we get

[formula]

Thus the velocity fields [formula] and v differ by a harmonic function and both decay at infinity. Hence they are equal.

The total mass and the center of mass are invariants of the motion. We include a short proof of this classical fact for the sake of the reader.

Let ω0 be a smooth compactly supported initial vorticity with non zero total mass. Then for any positive time t

[formula]

The conservation of mass follows easily from the characteristics method. The vorticity ω(t) can be expressed in terms of its initial value and the flow ψ according to the formula

[formula]

The incompressibility condition entails that the flow preserves Lebesgue measure and thus the mass is conserved in time.

The invariance of the center of mass follows from the constancy of the functions

[formula]

Differentiation of the functions fj with respect to the time variable combined with the vorticity equation [\eqref=vorts1] yields

[formula]

Since ω  =  ∂1v2  -  ∂2v1, an integration by parts yields

[formula]

We now explore the relationship between center of rotation and center of mass.

Let ω0  =  χD be a vortex patch with non zero total mass, which rotates around the point x0, . Then necessarily x0 is the center of mass of the domain D.

By a change of variables

[formula]

Since X(t) = X(0) by Proposition [\eqref=cons1], X(0) is fixed by the rotation and thus X(0) = x0, as claimed.

The last result of this section is the nontrivial fact that any rotating patch must have a constant angular velocity.

Let ω0  =  χD be a rotating vortex patch different from the Rankine vortex. Then the angular velocity is necessarily constant, that is,

[formula]

for some constants Ω and θ0.

Let s  ↦  γt(s) be a parametrization of the boundary of the patch [formula] Then, as we will prove in the next section, the motion of the boundary ∂Dt satisfies equation [\eqref=boundary], namely

[formula]

Here the prime denotes derivative with respect to the s variable. This equation leads to [\eqref=triss1], that is,

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

If there exists some s with [formula] then, since the right-hand side does not depend on the time variable, we conclude that [formula] is constant. Otherwise, [formula] vanishes everywhere, which tells us that the initial domain is a disc. Thus our vortex is the Rankine vortex, which rotates with any angular velocity.

Boundary motion

We shall in what follows describe the motion of a piecewise constant vorticity in the plane. Let Dj,  1  ≤  j  ≤  n, be a family of simply connected domains such that for each j the closure of Dj + 1 is contained in Dj. Assume moreover that the boundary Γj of Dj is a Jordan curve of class C1,   1  ≤  j  ≤  n. We set [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1 and En  =  Dn. Let αj,1  ≤  j  ≤  n, be a family of real numbers such that α1  ≠  0 and αj  ≠  αj + 1 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1. Now take an initial vorticity of the form

[formula]

where χEj denotes the characteristic function of Ej. Since the vorticity is conserved along the particle trajectories, the initial structure of the vorticity is preserved in time. Thus the vorticity at time t has the form

[formula]

where ψ is the flow map

[formula]

associated with the velocity v. We will describe the dynamics of the interfaces [formula] In particular, the case n = 1 gives the equation for the boundary motion of a simply connected vortex patch and the case n = 2 and α1  =  1,α2 = 0, provides the system of two equations for the boundary of a doubly connected rotating vortex patch. There are at least two natural ways to derive the equations of the boundary.

First approach

The motion of the interfaces Γj,t,  1  ≤  j  ≤  n, is subject to the kinematic constraint that the boundary is transported with the flow. In particular, it is a material surface and thus there is no flux matter across the boundary. Since we assume that the interfaces Γj are C1-smooth we can express Γj, for each fixed j satisfying 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, as where φj is a real function of class C1 on the plane, such that [formula] φj  <  0 on Dj and φj  >  0 on [formula] One says that φj is a defining function for Γj. Set where ψ is the flow [\eqref=flow]. Then x  →  Fj(t,x) is a defining function for Γj,t  =  ψ(t,Γj). Since by definition Fj(t,x) is transported by the flow , it satisfies the transport equation

[formula]

Now, let γt(s) be a parametrization of Γ1,t, continuously differentiable in t, and let [formula] be the unit outward normal vector to Γ1,t. Differentiating the equation F(t,γt(s)) = 0 with respect to t yields

[formula]

Since for x∈Γj,t the vector [formula] is perpendicular to Γj,t, we obtain

[formula]

The meaning of [\eqref=boundarys] is that the velocity of the boundary and the the velocity of the fluid particle occupying the same position have the same normal components. We observe that equation [\eqref=boundarys] can be written in the complex form

[formula]

where the "prime" denotes derivative with respect to the s variable.

We now take a closer look at the case of a rotating doubly connected vortex patch. Assume that the two interfaces rotate with the same angular velocity [formula] around some point, which can be assumed to be the origin. Denote by γ0 a parametrization of one of the initial interfaces. Then γt(s) = eiθ(t)γ0(s) is a parametrization of the transported interface at time t and, on one hand, we get

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=vel-eq]

[formula]

Hence, on the other hand,

[formula]

Therefore [\eqref=boundary] becomes

[formula]

It follows from the identity above, as we remarked before, that the angular velocity [formula] is constant. Recall that [formula] and let Ψ stand for the stream function at time 0, namely, Then v0(z)  =  2i∂zΨ(γ0) and so

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=triss1] and [\eqref=Imv] we conclude that the initial interfaces [formula] satisfy the system of n equations

[formula]

where [formula] denotes a tangent vector to the boundary at the point z.

Second approach

We will give another way to derive the equation [\eqref=eq1], which consists in analyzing directly the vorticity equation. According to the Definition [\ref=defa1] and assuming that the center of rotation is the origin a rotating vorticity has the structure [formula] Straightforward computations show that

[formula]

Combining this identity with Proposition [\ref=vel-eq] yields

[formula]

We have used the symbol 〈,〉 to denote the usual scalar product in the plane and in the second identity the fact that rotations preserve the scalar product. A simple calculation yields

[formula]

Consequently, the vorticity equation becomes

[formula]

Recall that for a smoothly bounded domain D

[formula]

where dσ is the arc-length measure on ∂D and [formula] the exterior unit normal. Then, for an initial vorticity as in [\eqref=multiconss], we get

[formula]

with dσj the the arc-length measure on the curve Γj. Since by the assumption α1 and αj + 1  -  αj do not vanish, equation [\eqref=vortds] is equivalent to

[formula]

We conclude from [\eqref=second2] that the only way in which [formula] may be non-constant is that [formula] on the union of the interfaces [formula] If this is the case then the interfaces must be concentric circles. Denote by [formula] a tangent vector at the point x = z of Γ. Using the identities

[formula]

we finally obtain

[formula]

which is [\eqref=eq1] after setting [formula].

We close this subsection by noticing that a rotating vortex appears as a stationary solution for the vorticity equation for the Euler system in the presence of the linear external velocity [formula], namely,

[formula]

This follows easily from [\eqref=vortds].

The role of the Cauchy transform

In this subsection we describe the motion of a rotating vortex patch of the form [\eqref=multicon11] by means of the Cauchy transforms of the domains Dj. Without loss of generality and in order to simplify the presentation we shall restrict our attention to the case of two interfaces. Hence the initial vorticity has the form

[formula]

One usually defines the stream function as the logarithmic potential of the vorticity at time t, that is,

[formula]

where dA is Lebesgue measure on the plane. Differentiating [\eqref=logpot] with respect to the variable z yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

denotes the Cauchy transform of the domain D (actually, of the characteristic function of D). It is well-known and easy to check that the Cauchy transform is continuous on [formula], holomorphic off [formula] and has zero limit at infinity. If D is a bounded domain with boundary of class C1, there is a formula for the Cauchy transform of D, which we proceed to describe below, involving only integrals over the boundary Γ  =  ∂D. The Cauchy integral of the function [formula] on D is

[formula]

where we have used the notation [formula]. Similarly the Cauchy integral of [formula] on [formula] is

[formula]

It is plain that the previous functions are holomorphic in their domains of definition. They can be extended continuously up to the boundary of D. This follows easily from dominated convergence and the identity

[formula]

which holds in the domains of definition of γ±. For the sake of simple notations the one-sided limit at the boundary will be denoted by γ±(z) as well. The Plemelj-Sokhotski formulae (see [\cite=V]) for the function [formula] are the identities

[formula]

where the boundary integrals are understood in the principal value sense. Subtracting one gets the jump formula

[formula]

The Cauchy transform of D can be reconstructed from the functions γ±. According to the Cauchy-Pompeiu formula for the function [formula] ( see[\eqref=GC1] below) one has

[formula]

and

[formula]

We emphasize that these formulae hold also on the boundary Γ.

We now come back to the formula [\eqref=stream] for the stream function. Denote by γ±j the Cauchy integrals of [formula] for the domain Dj,  i = 1,2. The identities [\eqref=Cauchydins] and [\eqref=Cauchyfora] combined with [\eqref=stream] yield

[formula]

and

[formula]

Putting together [\eqref=gam1], [\eqref=gam2] and [\eqref=eq1] we obtain the nonlinear system of two equations

[formula]

with λ = 1 - 2Ω.

We mention for future reference that on Γ2 the preceding equation can also be written in the form

[formula]

Tools from potential theory

Preliminaries on complex analysis

We begin by recalling a classical results about complex functions. The derivatives of a smooth function [formula] with respect to z and [formula] are defined as

[formula]

Let D be a finitely connected domain bounded by finitely many smooth Jordan curves and let Γ be ∂D endowed with the positive orientation. Then the Cauchy-Pompeiu formula reads as For z∈∂D the boundary integral has to be understood as the limit from D of the same integral. Taking [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Cauchy transform

We intend to compute the Cauchy transform [\eqref=Cauchy] of discs and ellipses. This can be done rather easily using [\eqref=Cauchydins] and [\eqref=Cauchyfora], namely,

[formula] The discs. To begin with we consider the unit disc. Since [formula] on ∂D,

[formula]

Therefore For a disc of center z0 and radius r translating and dilating the previous result gives

[formula] The ellipses. Let D be the domain enclosed by the ellipse [formula] We set c2 = a2 - b2. If the major semi-axis is a then the foci of the ellipse are [formula] Otherwise the foci are [formula] Rewriting the cartesian equation of the ellipse in terms of the variables z and [formula] and solving for [formula] leads to

[formula]

where

[formula]

By Cauchy's Integral Formula

[formula]

Since [formula] is holomorphic off [formula] and has a double zero at infinity,

[formula]

Hence To compute the function γ- we use Cauchy's Integral Formula in [formula] to get

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

Remark that γ -  satisfies the equation

[formula]

For the general case where the ellipse is centered at z0 and its major axis makes an angle θ with the horizontal axis one has

Inverse problems

We shall see along this paper that the equations governing the interfaces of the rotating patch can be solved in some cases and allow to get explicitly the Cauchy transforms of the involved domains. It is a general fact that the knowledge of the Cauchy transform outside a domain D is equivalent to the knowledge of the geometrical moments [formula] defined by [formula] since it is a generating function of these moments. Now the problem is to see whether the shape of the domain is encoded by its Cauchy transform. This is an inverse problem of potential theory which appears in several contexts like celestial mechanics or geophysics: earth's shape, gravitational lensing [\cite=Fas], Hele-Shaw flows [\cite=Var],... The inverse problem is not uniquely solvable in general as some counter-examples show (see for instance [\cite=Var]). However uniqueness can be established for example under the assumption that the domains are starlike with respect to a common point ([\cite=Nov]).

In our context, the Cauchy transform has a special algebraic form and, as we shall see, this determines uniquely the shape giving rise to the Cauchy transform at hand. There are two kinds of problems that we are led to deal with. In the first one we discuss the case where the Cauchy transform is known inside the domain and given by a first order polynomial function. In the second one the Cauchy transform is known outside the domain and this case seems to be trickier. For the first case we prove the following result.

Let Γ be a Jordan curve of class C1 enclosing a bounded domain D. Assume that there exist [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

Then the curve Γ is an ellipse of center z0 with semi-axes a and b satisfying

According to the jump formula [\eqref=plem] we have on Γ the decomposition

[formula]

with γ- holomorphic on [formula] and decaying at infinity like [formula] It follows that for any z∈Γ

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let A and B be two real numbers that will be chosen later on. For z∈Γ one has

[formula]

with

[formula]

Now choose A and B such that BQ - A(1 + Q2) = 0 in order to kill the quadratic term. For example we can take

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

The function g is clearly holomorphic on [formula] and has a limit at infinity given by

[formula]

where we applied Green-Stokes in the last identity. Notice that g has a continuous extension up to the boundary Γ and takes real values on this set. Then the imaginary part of g is a harmonic function on the exterior domain [formula], continuous up to the boundary and satisfying

[formula]

By the maximum principle we conclude that [formula] is identically zero on [formula]. Thus the holomorphic function g is real on [formula] and consequently must be constant. This means that

[formula]

with C a constant. Set [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

This is an equation for the curve Γ in the cartesian coordinates X and Y. For [formula] the curve Γ is an ellipse. For Q∈{ - 1,1} the curve reduces to a segment, which is not possible by the assumptions. The proof of the desired result is complete.

Next we shall consider the case where the Cauchy transform is prescribed outside the domain. We will prove the following result.

Let Γ be a Jordan curve of class C1 enclosing a domain D and let z1 be a point in D such that

[formula]

with a and b real constants. Then there exists a constant c such that curve Γ is contained in the set

[formula]

From the jump formula [\eqref=plem] we have

[formula]

with

[formula]

By assumption Set [formula] and   [formula]. Then the preceding identity can be written as

[formula]

with [formula], which is holomorphic in [formula]. By [\eqref=sifr] and where φ1 is holomorphic in [formula]. Taking the appropriate linear combination of the previous three identities we kill the singularity at the origin, that is, It is plain that φ2 is holomorphic in [formula] and the function in the left-hand side is real-valued. Thus φ2 is constant and so

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Proofs of the main results

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=impresuld] and Theorem [\ref=impresul]. Recall that we are dealing with a rotating vorticity of the form [\eqref=multiconss] with only two interfaces, that is, where D1 and D2 are simply connected domains satisfying [formula] As we have already seen the description of the rotating vorticity in this special case is governed by the equations [\eqref=bdd1]. Owing to the complicated structure of this system, which is strongly nonlinear and nonlocal, a description of the full set of solutions seems to be out of reach. However, as we stated in Theorem 1 we can show that if one of the interfaces is a circle then the patch is necessarily trivial, in the sense that it is an annulus. In Theorem 2 we completely solve the system assuming that the inner interface is an ellipse. Then the exterior interface is a confocal ellipse and certain relations (introduced in [\cite=Flierl]) between the angular velocity of rotation, the inner vorticity α and the parameters of the ellipses must be satisfied. Likewise the result should also hold under the assumption that the exterior interface is an ellipse, but we have not been able to solve the corresponding inverse problem.

Circular interfaces : the proof of Theorem 1

The proof relies on equation [\eqref=bd1] combined with the inverse problem results established in the previous section. We first study the case in which the inner interface Γ2 is a circle, which is easier than the other one.

Case 1 : Γ2 a circle.

Let Γ2 be a circle centered at z2. Assume, without loss of generality, that z2 lies in the real axis. Then γ+2(z) = z2 and thus equation [\eqref=bd1] reduces to

[formula]

Since [formula] is a tangent vector at the point z∈Γ2,

[formula]

Observe that γ+1(z) = (1 - 2Ω)z2 is a solution of the above equation. We will show that this is the only solution. Set φ(z) = γ+1(z) - (1 - 2Ω)z2, so that

[formula]

It is plain that z  ↦  φ(z)(z - z2) is holomorphic in D1, which contains [formula], and its imaginary part is a harmonic function vanishing on the boundary Γ2. By the maximum principle [formula] in D2 and so φ(z)(z - z2) is constant in D2. Evaluating at z2 we see that this constant must be zero and then that φ vanishes identically on D2 and hence on D1 by holomorphic continuation. Therefore

[formula]

Now in view of Proposition [\ref=propinv] the function γ+1 determines the shape of the boundary Γ1, which turns out to be a circle centered at the point [formula] The next step is to show that the two circles have the same center. With this in mind we substitute in equation [\eqref=bdd1] the expression [\eqref=gamma2] for γ+1 and the identity

[formula]

r being the radius of the circle Γ2. We conclude that

[formula]

Since z1 and z2 are real,

[formula]

Set w = z - z1 and z0 = z1 - z2. Write the preceding equation in terms of w and z0, replace w by - w and add the two equations. We obtain

[formula]

As α  ≠  1 we obtain z0 = 0, namely z1 = z2. Then the interfaces are concentric circles and there is no restriction on the parameters α and Ω. This is coherent with the fact that in this case the vorticity is radial and therefore the flow is stationary.

Case 2 : Γ1 a circle.

Let z1 be the center of Γ1. Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] and that the center of mass is the origin. This implies that the center of mass z2 of D2 is real. Our goal is to prove that Γ2 must be a circle centered at z1. Equation [\eqref=bdd1] on Γ1 takes the form which is clearly equivalent to Set w = z - z1, Γ̃j  =   - z1  +  Γj and   =   - z1  +  Dj,i = 1,2. Thus the preceding equation becomes

[formula]

Since [formula] for ξ∈Γ̃2 and w∈Γ̃1, one has

[formula]

where

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

By Green-Stokes

[formula]

Now since α  ≠  1 and [formula], equation [\eqref=four1] holds true if and only if

[formula]

r1 being the radius of Γ1. Thus we obtain the following expression for γ2

[formula]

Since γ-2 is continuous in [formula] the pole z1 of γ-2 must be in D2. Now we will evaluate the coefficient a1. Using Green-Stokes

[formula]

Let z2 be the center of mass of D2. Thus

[formula]

and so

[formula]

If we knew that z1 = z2, then a1 = 0 and therefore Γ2 would be a circle of center z1 by Proposition [\ref=invext].

It remains to show that a1 vanishes. Combining equations [\eqref=bdd1] and [\eqref=gamma102] we get

[formula]

Our next task is to find a useful expression for a tangent vector [formula] to Γ̃2 at the point w. Recall that by Proposition [\ref=invext] the curve Γ̃2 is defined in Cartesian coordinates by

[formula]

A tangent vector is then given by

[formula]

Substituting this expression for w' in equation [\eqref=bdr1] one gets

[formula]

where we have set A = a1(1 - α). This gives

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

Using [\eqref=cart] with a replaced by a0 and b by a1 we find

[formula]

Since [formula] is connected, either |w| is constant on [formula] and we are done, or |w| takes a continuum of values on [formula] In the second case the polynomial obtained by replacing in the left-hand side of [\eqref=equa] |w| by the real variable t has infinitely many zeroes and hence is the zero polynomial. Thus the coefficient a0A must be zero. Since πa0  =  |D2|  ≠  0 and α  ≠  1, a1 = 0 and the proof is complete.

Elliptical interfaces : the proof of Theorem 2

We turn now to the proof of Theorem [\ref=impresul]. First we will prove that if the interior curve is an ellipse then the rigid motion of the interfaces will force the domains to have the same center of mass. The equations [\eqref=bdd1] and the explicit form of the function γ+2 will lead to the identification of γ+1, via the maximum principle. At this stage we are led to understand the link between the geometry of the domain and its inside Cauchy transform γ+. This is a kind of inverse problem of two-dimensional potential theory that we have already discussed in the previous section in the context of circles. In the case at hand we show that the exterior curve Γ1 is an ellipse and we find some information on its shape. Armed with this precious information we solve explicitly the equations [\eqref=bdd1].

First reduction

First of all we can assume without loss of generality that z2 is a positive real number. Let θ denote the angle between the major axis of the ellipse Γ2 and the real axis. We have to show that [formula].

Recall that by [\eqref=bd1] the equation that describes rotation with angular velocity Ω on Γ2 is where [formula] denotes a tangent vector to Γ2 at the point z. For j∈{1,2}, let φj denote a complex primitive of γ+j on the domain Dj. This primitive is well-defined since γ+j is holomorphic on the simply connected domain Dj. Consequently equation [\eqref=bd1] is equivalent to

[formula]

for some constant C.

Let ψ be the solution of the Dirichlet problem on D2 with boundary data |z|2,  z∈Γ2. Since ψ is harmonic in D2 and D2 is simply connected, there exists a holomorphic H function on D2 such that ψ is the real part of H. Hence equation [\eqref=bd2] becomes

[formula]

The function in the left-hand side of the preceding identity is harmonic in D2 and continuous up to the boundary. By the maximum principle this function is identically zero in the domain D2. Therefore, since holomorphic functions that take real values on a domain are constant,

[formula]

where prime denotes derivative with respect to z. Hence

[formula]

because [formula] This determines completely the function γ+1 in D2 and thus in D1, by analytic continuation. To take full advantage of [\eqref=gamma] we need to have explicit expressions for γ+2 and 2∂zψ. For γ+2 it is just a matter of applying a translation and a rotation to [\eqref=Eqq4]. We get

[formula]

For ∂zψ we solve explicitly the Dirichlet problem defining ψ and then we take a derivative with respect to z. In order to do so we need to write the equation of the boundary Γ2 in the variables z and [formula] Consider first the ellipse [formula] Expressing x and y in terms of z and [formula] we find for E the equation

[formula]

Assume now that a and b are the semi-axes of the ellipse Γ2. Then an equation for Γ2 is

[formula]

Solving for |z|2 and remarking that the function which gives the solution is harmonic in D2 we conclude that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Inserting [\eqref=SPD] and [\eqref=gamma2plus] in [\eqref=gamma] yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

We have proved that γ+1 is a first degree polynomial and we are almost done. First we remark that the assumption that the center of mass of the initial vorticity is the origin implies that the centers of mass zj of Dj,j = 1,2, satisfy

[formula]

In particular z1 is a real number.

It is a general fact that if D is any bounded domain then

[formula]

This follows from [\eqref=Cauchydins] and the observation that

[formula]

because the Cauchy kernel is odd. Taking the mean value of γ+1 on D1 and using [\eqref=gamma1] and [\eqref=center] one obtains

[formula]

Thus 2θ is an integer multiple of π and so the line through the origin and z2 is an axis of Γ2.

We are left with the task of showing that Γ1 is an ellipse, which is easy. Indeed, setting

[formula]

where the minus sign corresponds to θ = 0 and the plus sign to θ  =  π / 2, we obtain, rewriting [\eqref=gamma1],

[formula]

Here the plus sign corresponds to θ = 0 and the minus sign to θ  =  π / 2. Since z1 is real an application of Proposition [\ref=propinv] shows that Γ1 is an ellipse, which completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=gamma1ellipse].

Second reduction

We know now that if ω0  =  χD1 + (α - 1)χD2 is a rotating vorticity and the interior curve is an ellipse, then the exterior curve is also an ellipse and its axes are parallel to those of the interior ellipse. However, the only information we have up to now about the relative position of the center of mass of ω0 and the centers of the ellipses is that they lie on a straight line.

Assume, without loss of generality, that the center of mass of ω0 is the origin. Let zj be the center of Γj,  j = 1,2. We may also assume that z2 is real. Then z1 is also real because of [\eqref=centermass]. By [\eqref=bdd1] the equation that describes rotation with angular velocity Ω on Γ1 is

[formula]

with λ = 1 - 2Ω. Since z1 is real, by the first reduction γ+1(z) =   ±  Q1(z - z1) + z1. Assume that the sign in front of Q1 is plus (the same argument will work with the minus sign). Then

[formula]

Setting w = z - z1 the preceding equation becomes

[formula]

Here [formula] is the tangent vector to the ellipse - z1  +  Γ1 at the point w. The expression of A1 and B1 in terms of the length of the semi-axes a1 and b1 of Γ1 can be obtained by using the standard parametrization of an ellipse. One gets

The ellipse [formula] is centered at the origin and its axes lies along the coordinate axes. Set

[formula]

As we mentioned in [\eqref=Eqq4] h2 is given by

[formula]

Translating we see that

[formula]

Let d  =  z1 - z2. Then equation [\eqref=dsr1] can be rewritten as

[formula]

The ellipse - z1  +  Γ1 is centered at zero and invariant under the mapping w  →   - w. Therefore writing the above equation for - w and subtracting both equations yields, for w∈ - z1  +  Γ1,

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the extended complex plane (or Riemann sphere). Let U be the domain enclosed by the ellipse  - z1  +  Γ1. Our next task is to find a solution to the Dirichlet problem in the domain [formula] in the Riemann sphere with boundary data [formula] By [\eqref=cauc12]

[formula]

with

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and so

[formula]

and

[formula]

The right-hand side above is harmonic in [formula] and then is the solution of the Dirichlet problem in [formula] with boundary data the left-hand side. Inserting this identity into [\eqref=Ez12] and using [\eqref=Ez124] and the relation A1 + B1Q1 = 1 one gets

[formula]

where A stands for [formula] In the left-hand side of the preceding identity one is taking the imaginary part of a holomorphic function in [formula] Hence, for some constant C,

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

Computing the coefficient of [formula] in the expansion at ∞   of the left-hand side of [\eqref=hol] we get the relation

[formula]

Set

[formula]

An easy argument based on [\eqref=hol] and [\eqref=coe] gives

[formula]

The function in the left-hand side above is odd and holomorphic at ∞   so that in its expansion in powers of 1 / w the even powers vanish identically. The coefficient of 1 / w also vanishes identically. Instead, the fact that the other odd powers vanish, because of [\eqref=zero], provides a countable family of equations in the parameters d,c1 and c2. Our goal is to show that d = 0 using the equations corresponding to the coefficients of 1 / w3,1 / w5 and 1 / w7. Recall that then z1 = z2 = 0 and we are done.

The coefficient of 1 / w3 is Hence either d = 0 or

[formula]

The coefficient of 1 / w5 is

[formula]

As before, if d = 0 we are done and so we can assume that this is not the case. If cj = 0 for j = 1 or j = 2, then Γj is a circle and this case has been dealt with in subsection 5.1.

Dividing in [\eqref=c5] by c42, eliminating the even powers of d by means of [\eqref=di] and setting q = c1 / c2 we get q2 - 12q + 11 = 0, which yields q = 1 or q = 11. If q = 1 then d = 0 by [\eqref=di]. Let q = 11. The coefficient of 1 / w7 turns out to be

[formula]

Eliminating the even powers of d in [\eqref=c7] by means of [\eqref=di] and setting c21  =  11c22 we obtain Since we are in the case c2  ≠  0, we conclude that d = 0, which completes the proof.

Resolution of the boundary equations

Up to now we have shown that if the interior curve is an ellipse then necessarily the exterior curve is an ellipse with the same center and parallel axes. Our next target is to give a complete description of the parameters λ,α,Q1 and Q2 in order to get a uniform rotation. This will complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=impresul].

We start by investigating the equation on the interior curve Γ2.

Equation on Γ2. Recall that the equation [\eqref=bd1] that describes rotation with angular velocity Ω on Γ2 is

[formula]

We have used the fact that γ+j(z) = Qj  z,  j  =  1,2. As we mentioned before, a straightforward computation shows that a tangent vector to the ellipse Γj at the point z is given by

[formula]

Recall that c2j  =  a2j - b2j gives the foci of the ellipse. Hence we obtain

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

This condition is satisfied only when

[formula]

We would to write this equation in terms of Q1,Q2 and Ω only. From the elementary identities

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Thus [\eqref=Eqs2] becomes

[formula]

Equation on Γ1. Using equation [\eqref=bdd1] on Γ1, we get

[formula]

Since [formula]

[formula]

Let us introduce the function

[formula]

Since on Γ1 we have [formula] G(z) can be written as

[formula]

Setting M = λB1 + Q1A1 and using the identity A1 + B1Q1 = 1 we find

[formula]

Thus equation [\eqref=eqgam1] on Γ1 becomes

[formula]

The next step is to solve the Dirichlet problem on the domain [formula] of the Riemann sphere [formula] with boundary data [formula] With this goal in mind recall the identity

[formula]

where

[formula]

Squaring [\eqref=schwarz] we obtain

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq4]

[formula]

It is easy to check that

[formula]

Consequently

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

which tells us that the function on the right-hand side is the solution of the Dirichlet problem in [formula] with boundary data given by the left-hand side. Inserting this into [\eqref=Eq7] yields

[formula]

Since the function inside the imaginary part in the preceding identity is holomorphic on [formula] it is constant. In other words, for some constant C,

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=eq4] we obtain

[formula]

and recalling that B2  =   - c22 / 2a2b2

[formula]

Dividing this equation by {γ-2(z)}2 we get a second degree polynomial equation in the unknown γ-1  /  γ-2, namely,

[formula]

This implies that [formula] with μ a constant. Consequently,

[formula]

In particular the ellipses Γ1 and Γ2 are confocal. Moreover

[formula]

One can easily check that

[formula]

This yields

[formula]

We will rewrite this equation in terms of Q1,Q2 and λ. By [\eqref=Eq8] equation [\eqref=Eq10] reduces to

[formula]

Now M can be expressed as

[formula]

Thus equation[\eqref=Eqss1] becomes, if [formula]

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

Combining this equation with [\eqref=eq3] we get the system

[formula]

To solve this system we distinguish two cases.

Case 1: Q1 + (α - 1)Q2 = 0. Since the ellipse Γ2 is not a circle then [formula] and the second equation of the preceding system gives necessary λ = 1 - α. Inserting this value into the first equation of [\eqref=ss12] yields α = 0 and so Q1 = Q2. The latter condition is impossible because the ellipses are confocal and different.

Case 2: [formula]. Dividing the first equation in [\eqref=ss12] by the second we get

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Multiplying the second equation of [\eqref=ss12] by Q2 and using the previous identity we see that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Recalling that 1 - λ = 2Ω elementary arithmetics leads to

[formula]

Set [formula] Then equation [\eqref=ident11] is

[formula]

The solutions of the quadratic equation above are

[formula]

which can be readily written as

[formula]

From the second equation in [\eqref=ss12] the Q1 associated to Ω+ is given by

[formula]

Since the ellipses are confocal this means that they are the same, which is not the case. The value of Q1 associated to Ω- is given by

[formula]

Recall that the ellipses are confocal and [formula] Then 0  <  Q1 / Q2  <  1, which is equivalent to

[formula]

In conclusion, the ellipses rotate with the same angular velocity Ω if and only if we have the relations which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=impresul].
