A New Generalization of Fermat's Last Theorem

1. Introduction

In this paper, we consider some hybrid Diophantine equations of addition and multiplication. First of all, such that for [formula], which is a new variant of Waring's problem: We denote by g'(k) (resp. G'(k)) the least positive integer such that every integer (resp. all sufficiently large integer) can be represented as a sum of at most g'(k) (resp. G'(k)) positive integers, and the product of the g'(k) (resp. G'(k)) integers is a k-th power. We show [\cite=1] that where k is a positive integer and p is prime. In this paper, we improve the results on composite numbers as follow.

For any composite number k, G'(k)  ≤  k + 2.

Next, we consider Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1637, Fermat claimed that the Diophantine equation has no positive integer solutions for any integer [formula]. This was proved finally by Andrew Wiles in 1995 [\cite=15] [\cite=14].

There are several generalizations of Fermat's Last Theorem, e.g., Fermat-Catalan conjecture, which states that the equation am + bn = ck has only finitely many solutions (a,b,c,m,n,k) , where a,b,c are positive coprime integers and m,n,k are positive integers, satisfying [formula]. So far there are only 10 solutions found [\cite=4] [\cite=10]. Meanwhile, Beal's conjecture [\cite=7] states that the equation Ax + By = Cz has no solution in positive integers A,B,C,x,y and z with x,y and z at least 3 and A,B and C coprime. Beal has offered a prize of one million dollars for a proof of his conjecture or a counterexample [\cite=16]. Obviously, there are only finite solutions for Beal's equation under Fermat-Catalan conjecture. Meanwhile, it's known that both FLT and Fermat-Catalan conjecture are the consequences of the abc-conjecture, the latter was claimed to be proved in 2012 but not confirmed yet by Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki [\cite=9].

Now we expand the same idea to Fermat's equation as we did before to Hilbert-Waring problem. We consider a new Diophantine equation

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. It is easy to see that if gcd (A,B,C) = 1 then A,B,C are pairwise coprime. Therefore,

[formula]

In view of (2), we may ask some natural questions concerning (1) : 1. Is it possible to have a solution for all [formula]? If so, is it possible to have infinitely many solutions ? 2. Is it possible to have a solution when gcd (A,B,C) = pk, where p is a prime, [formula] ? In this paper, we answer the first question affirmatively by proving the following result.

For any [formula], (1) has infinitely many positive integer solutions; for any [formula], (1) has no positive integer solutions.

For the second question, we discuss the special cases n = 4,5 and obtain the following

If gcd (A,B,C) = pk where [formula], p is odd prime and [formula], then the equation

[formula]

has no positive integer solutions.

For p = 2 and some [formula], it is possible for (3) to have a positive integer solution when gcd (A,B,C) = p. For example where p =  gcd (A,B,C) = 2,17,5,239, so [formula] respectively.

If gcd (A,B,C) = pk where [formula], p is odd prime and [formula], then the equation

[formula]

has no positive integer solutions.

In general, we have the follows:

If n  ≥  3 is prime, gcd (A,B,C) = pk where [formula], p is odd prime and [formula], then (1) has no positive integer solutions.

Finally, if n > 3 is prime, we construct special prime p such that (1) has positive integer solutions for gcd (A,B,C) = pk as following

If n > 3 is prime, [formula], 1  ≤  r  ≤  2, [formula], [formula], such that [formula] is an odd prime and a + b = mn, then [formula] and (1) has positive integer solutions for gcd (A,B,C) = pk where [formula], [formula].

Let a = 2,b =  - 1,m = 1, we obtain

If n > 3 is prime, [formula], 1  ≤  r  ≤  2 and p = 2n - 1 is Mersenne prime, then (1) has positive integer solutions for gcd (A,B,C) = pk where [formula], [formula].

Moreover, we have the following

If n > 3 is prime, [formula], 1  ≤  r  ≤  2 and gcd (A,B,C) = pk where p is prime and [formula] , then (1) has no positive integer solutions.

In particular, if n > 3 is prime, then [formula], so [formula], it follows that we have a special case of Conjecture 2 when k = 1:

If n is odd prime, gcd (A,B,C) = p is prime, then (1) has no positive integer solutions.

If n = 3, Conjecture 3 is true by Theorem 2. If abc-conjecture is true, then Conjecture 3 should be true for fixed prime p and sufficiently large n where n need not be prime.

Because gcd (A,B,C) = p, then [formula]. By (1) we have So [formula] and [formula]. For any [formula] and [formula], we deduce and By abc-conjecture, there exist only finitely many triples [formula]. Let [formula], then gcd (A1,B1,C1) = 1, p3A1B1C1 = Dn. Let M be the greatest m such that there is prime q satisfying qm|A1B1C1. Then, if n > M + 3, there is no solution for p3A1B1C1 = Dn. Hence, when gcd (A,B,C) = p, (1) has no positive integer solutions for sufficiently large n.

However, we could not deduce Conjectures 1-3 from abc-conjecture.

2. Preliminaries

[\cite=2] Let c be a nonzero integer. The equation x4 - y4 = cz2 has a rational solution with [formula] if and only if |c| is a congruent number.

[\cite=13] Let p be a prime congruent to 3 modulo 8, then p is not a congruent number.

[\cite=5] Let A > 2 be a positive integer and has no prime divisors of the form 10k + 1, then the equation

[formula]

has no nonzero integer solution. If A = 2, the solutions of (5) are (x,y,z) =   ±  (1,1,1).

This lemma was first conjectured by V. A. Lebesgue [\cite=6] in 1843 and proved by E. Halberstadt and A. Kraus [\cite=5] in 2004.

For any prime p, integer [formula], if gcd (A,B,C) = pk and [formula], [formula], then (1) has no nonzero integer solutions.

Let [formula], [formula], [formula], in view of gcd (A,B,C) = pk and (1), we obtain that A1,B1,C1 are pairwise coprime and (1) can be changed into But [formula], A1,B1,C1 are pairwise coprime, so A1 = xn, B1 = yn, C1 = zn and xn + yn = zn. By Fermat's Last Theorem, we deduce that xyz = 0, so ABC = 0. Contradiction.

3. Proofs of the Theorems

For every positive integer n, let n = km + r where 0  ≤  r  ≤  k - 1. If r = 0, when n > 2k2k, we have [formula] and If 0 < r  ≤  k - 1, when n > k2k - 1 + k, we have [formula] and

If [formula], then there exists [formula] such that [formula]. It is well known that there exist infinitely many [formula] such that a2 + b2 = c2. Let So we have infinitely many positive solutions (A,B,C) satisfying (1), where [formula]. If [formula], suppose (A,B,C) is a positive solution of (1). Let d =  gcd (A,B,C). Then [formula] and [formula] are pairwise coprime and d3|Dn. But 3|n, so we have [formula] and Since [formula] and [formula] are pairwise coprime, so [formula] and x3 + y3 = z3. By Fermat's Last Theorem, we deduce that xyz = 0 and ABC = 0. Contradiction.

In view of Lemma 4, we only need to discuss [formula]. Suppose odd prime [formula] and (3) has a positive integer solution (A,B,C). In view of gcd (A,B,C) = pk, (3) can be changed into

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula] are pairwise coprime. But [formula], we deduce that only one of A1,B1,C1 is congruent to 0 modulo p. Let [formula], then 1  ≤  r  ≤  3. In view of (6) and reorder A1,B1 if necessary, we obtain

[formula]

or

[formula]

where x,y,pz are pairwise coprime. If A1,B1 and C1 satisfy (7), then

[formula]

But gcd (y,p) = 1, we have integer [formula] such that [formula]. By (9) we deduce that which implies that - 1 is a square modulo p, this can only hold for p = 2 and [formula], in contradiction with [formula]. If A1,B1 and C1 satisfy (8), then

[formula]

When r = 2, we have x4 - y4 = (pz2)2, but it is well known that the equation X4 - Y4 = Z2 has no nonzero integer solutions. So r = 1 or r = 3 and (10) can be changed into

[formula]

or

[formula]

respectively. By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we obtain that (11) and (12) have no positive integer solutions when [formula].

In view of Lemma 4, we only need to discuss [formula]. In view of gcd (A,B,C) = pk, (4) can be changed into

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula] are pairwise coprime. But [formula], we deduce that only one of A1,B1,C1 congruent to 0 modulo p. Let [formula], then 1  ≤  r  ≤  4. In view of (13) and reorder A1,B1,C1 if necessary, we obtain

[formula]

where x,y and pz are pairwise coprime. From (13) and (14) we deduce that

[formula]

But p is an odd prime and [formula], by Lemma 3, (15) has no positive integer solutions.

First of all, we prove that [formula] for any odd positive integer k, where [formula], [formula]. It is obvious that f(x,y) > 0 when [formula]. So we only need to prove the case xy < 0. If k = 1, [formula]. Suppose [formula] where [formula]. Because xy < 0 and [formula], we obtain By mathematical induction, we deduce that [formula] for any odd positive integer k, where [formula], [formula]. By condition of Theorem 5, we have a prime p such that

[formula]

Since [formula], we deduce from (16) that

[formula]

So

[formula]

Let

[formula]

where r is defined in the condition of Theorem 5 and integer [formula]. By (17), (18), (19) and a + b = mn, we obtain that A,B and C satisfy (1) where D = pr + 3tabm and where [formula]. Finally, we want to prove that [formula]. We only need to prove that [formula] because both p and n are odd primes. Since [formula], [formula] is prime, by Fermat's little Theorem, we have Now we only need to prove that [formula]. Suppose [formula], then [formula] and But p and n are two primes, so we deduce that p = n. If ab < 0, We may assume that a > 0, b < 0, then contradiction. If [formula], we may assume that [formula], [formula], but [formula] is prime, so a  ≠  b and [formula]. Reorder a,b (if necessary), we may assume that [formula], [formula]. If a = 1,[formula], then [formula]. Let f(b) = (bp + 1) - p(b + 1), then so for odd prime p, from which we deduce that [formula]. Contradiction. If [formula], [formula], then [formula], once again a contradiction!

Finally, we list some primes p satisfying the condition of Theorem 5 when n = 5,7.

4. New Fermat equation in quadratic fields

It's well-known that Fermat's equation xn + yn = zn has only the trivial solutions in integers when n  ≥  3. Therefore, it is an interest problem that whether Fermat's equation has non-trivial solutions in algebraic number fields. There are numerus papers on this problem and we can refer to [\cite=20] [\cite=19] and the references there. For the case n = 3, it was solved almost completely. In 1915, W. Burnside [\cite=20] proved that in quadratic field Fermat's equation x3 + y3 = z3 has solutions of the form

[formula]

where k is a rational number not equal to 0 and - 1. While k = 0, Fermat's equation x3 + y3 = z3 has no non-trivial solutions in [formula].

In 2013, M. Jones and J. Rouse [\cite=19] gave necessary and sufficient conditions on a square-free integer t such that x3 + y3 = z3 has a nontrivial solution in quadratic fields [formula], under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

Now we consider the new Fermat equation (1) for n = 3 in quadratic fields [formula]. Assume that the solution in quadratic fields [formula] has the form [formula] with ab  ≠  0. We have the following theorem.

For any square-free integer [formula] such that the elliptic curve

[formula]

has a nonzero rational solution (u,k), then (1) has infinitely many solutions (A,B,C,D) in [formula] for n = 3.

Let [formula]. When n = 3, we get from (1) that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Solving the above two equations, we have

[formula]

Taking e = kc,f = kd, from the formula of t, we have

[formula]

Let us consider ad + 2ab + cb - 2ck3d = 0, then

[formula]

Hence, we get

[formula]

Put a - 2ck3 = (1 + 4k3)b, then

[formula]

Therefore, for n = 3, (1) has solutions

[formula]

where a,c and k are non-zero rational numbers.

Let tu2 = 1 + 4k3, where t is a square-free integer and t  ≠  0,1. Then for n = 3 the new Fermat equation (1) has solutions

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem 6.

As an example, taking k =  - 1, then (1) has solutions

[formula]

where a,c are non-zero rational numbers.

To get Burnside's solutions for a given t, we need to consider the following elliptic curve

[formula]

By some calculations, we find that the elliptic curves tu2 = 1 + 4k3 and tu2 =  - 3(1 + 4k3) have the same j-invariant, so they are isomorphic and have the same rank. If they have the rank greater than 1, then there are infinitely many rational solutions (u,k) for both of these two elliptic curves. If they have the rank zero, we can't distinguish the torsion points on them, they might have or not have non-zero rational solutions. For - 50  ≤  t  ≤  50 and t is square-free, we find no other t as the above example t =  - 3. So we may ask the following question.

Question: Are there other t  ≠   - 3 such that for n = 3 the new Fermat equation (1) has non-trivial solutions but the Fermat equation x3 + y3 = z3 hasn't?
