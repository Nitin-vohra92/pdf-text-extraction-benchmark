On the Viability of Thermal Well-Tempered Dark Matter in SUSY GUTs

Introduction

The major motivations for supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM) are gauge coupling unification, a solution to the hierarchy problem, and the existence (in R-parity conserving models) of a dark matter (DM) candidate. In particular, supersymmetry allows the gauge couplings to unify at an amazing precision of about 3% [\cite=Dimopoulos:1981yj] [\cite=Dimopoulos:1981zb] [\cite=Ibanez:1981yh] [\cite=Sakai:1981gr] [\cite=Einhorn:1981sx] [\cite=Marciano:1981un]. Supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY GUTs) also allow for Yukawa coupling unification. For example, in minimal GUTS, each family of the standard model matter lives in one 16 dimensional representation, while the Higgses live in a 10 dimensional representation. The only renormalizable Yukawa coupling that can be written down in such theories is a λ , allowing for Yukawa coupling unification at the GUT scale. t - b - τ Yukawa unification requires [formula] in order to reproduce the correct ratio between the top and the bottom quark masses. The constraints on the SUSY boundary conditions at the GUT scale coming from requiring Yukawa unification have been extensively studied [\cite=Blazek:2001sb] [\cite=Baer:2001yy] [\cite=Blazek:2002ta] [\cite=Tobe:2003bc] [\cite=Auto:2003ys] [\cite=Gogoladze:2011ce] [\cite=Gogoladze:2011aa] [\cite=Badziak:2011wm] [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2012tj] [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2013cwa] [\cite=Ajaib:2013zha].

In SUSY GUT models with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is typically a pure Bino, for which the DM relic density is too high in thermal histories. A pure thermal Bino could produce the observed relic density through coannihilation effects or the A-resonance, in a region where [formula], where MA is the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs. Neither of these options are straightforward, however. Since each SM generation belongs to a 16-dimensional representation there is one universal scalar mass for each family at the GUT scale. The third generation sfermion mass is constrained to be very heavy ([formula] few TeV) due to flavor physics constraints from b  →  sγ transitions that are enhanced at large . Hence, coannihilation effects due to a light slepton that is nearly mass-degenerate with the LSP is difficult to obtain in these SUSY GUTs (assuming that the DM mass is itself in the sub-TeV range). Moreover, Yukawa unified GUTs prefer a large CP-odd Higgs mass to satisfy the Bs  →  μ+μ- constraint which puts the A-resonance region also in tension. The popular remaining options are to opt for a candidate such as the pure Wino or Higgsino (either in a non-thermal setting [\cite=Allahverdi:2012wb] or as a part of multicomponent DM scenarios [\cite=Baer:2008eq] [\cite=Baer:2008yd]) or to rely on a (thermal) well-tempered candidate. We will not explore the non-thermal or multi-component options in this paper. Dark matter in Yukawa unifed SUSY GUTs have been discused in earlier works of Ref. [\cite=Dermisek:2003vn] [\cite=Dermisek:2005sw] [\cite=Baer:2008jn] [\cite=Baer:2008yd].

The purpose of this paper is to study thermal, single-component well-tempered DM candidates [\cite=ArkaniHamed:2006mb] satisfying the relic density in SUSY GUT models, given the constraints emerging from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For models with heavy scalars, the gluino is constrained by CMS and ATLAS searches [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2013-061] [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013wxa] to be [formula] TeV, where the actual bound depends on the search strategy based on the final states from the decay of the gluino. On the other hand, the LHC has observed a new boson consistent with the SM Higgs with mass of about 125 GeV [\cite=:2012gu] [\cite=:2012gk].

One of the first conclusions we draw from the current study is that light ([formula] GeV) Higgsinos are difficult to obtain in Yukawa unified SUSY GUT models. This comes from simultaneously satisfying the observed Higgs mass and corrections to the bottom quark mass while also obtaining a gluino heavier than the LHC-excluded lower bound. For gluino [formula] 1.2 TeV, we find tensions in obtaining a 125 GeV Higgs mass, in spite of the heavy scalars. The fact that light Higgsinos are difficult to obtain implies that light Bino/Higgsino (  /  H̃) DM is disfavored in these models. This further implies that universal gaugino mass conditions, where   /  H̃ is the only viable thermal well-tempered DM candidate (due to large mass separation between the Bino and the Wino), are similarly disfavored.

We then proceed to explore Bino/Wino/Higgsino (  /  H̃  /  W̃) and Bino/Wino DM (  /  W̃). These cases require departure from gaugino mass universality at the GUT scale (to reduce the mass separation between Bino and Wino). The boundary condition we choose is mixed modulus-anomalous (mirage) mediation [\cite=Choi:2007ka] [\cite=Lowen:2008fm] [\cite=Baer:2006tb] which is independently well-motivated from string constructions. We perform a global χ2 analysis including the observables MW, MZ, GF, α- 1em, αs(MZ), Mt, mb(mb), Mτ,  b  →  sγ, BR(Bs  →  μ+μ-) and Mh. We then explore the best fit regions and study the thermal relic abundance, Ωh2.

Our main findings for   /  H̃  /  W̃ and   /  W̃ are the following: Compared to the case of universal gaugino masses and   /  H̃ DM, these cases perform better but are also somewhat fine-tuned. A certain degree of fine-tuning is expected in general for Bino/Wino coannihilation effects to be operational. This is exacerbated by the additional constraints on the Higgsinos, outlined above and shown in detail in Section [\ref=universalgaugino]. Nevertheless, we obtain regions of parameter space that have a well tempered neutralino DM and fit the other observables mentioned above at 90-95% confidence level.

The best fits are obtained for a certain range of α which is a parameter that controls the degree of departure from GUT-scale gaugino universality. α parametrizes the relative importance of (universal) modulus mediated and (β-function dependent) anomaly mediated contributions to the GUT scale gaugino masses. For α    ~    0 (the limit in which anomaly mediated contributions vanish), the tensions associated with universal gaugino masses become manifest while for large α (the limit in which anomaly mediated contributions dominate), the well tempering is ruined and the LSP becomes Wino-like. In the intermediate regions of α, the DM is a well tempered   /  H̃  /  W̃ or   /  W̃, where each component plays a role in the final annihilation cross section. Typically, in the case of   /  H̃  /  W̃ DM, the Higgsino component in the LSP turns out to be less than 8%, allowing us to (just) evade current direct detection limits although this type of DM will be detectable in the near future. The main annihilation channels in this region are [formula] and the coannihilation channels are [formula]. In the case of   /  W̃ DM, the Higgsino content is less than 1% and the relic density is mainly satisfied through coannihilation effects while the spin independent scattering cross section is much below current direct detection bounds.

It is important to note that independent of the thermal dark matter viability, these models will be severely constrained by the absence of a gluino at the next run of LHC. The best fit regions require a light gluino. The lower bound on the gluino mass is growing from the LHC data and the 14 TeV run at the LHC will conclusively test the regions discussed here.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In Section [\ref=yukawa], we introduce Yukawa unified SUSY GUT models, discuss well-tempering in these scenarios, and also discuss the procedure we adopt for the obtaining the best fit points. In Section [\ref=universalgaugino], we present the case light Higgsinos and Bino/Higgsino DM in models with universal gaugino masses. Section [\ref=BHdarkmattersection] contains our results for the   /  H̃  /  W̃ and   /  W̃ DM. Here, we first give a short background on the mirage boundary conditions and then present the spectra, fits, and properties of the well-tempered scenarios. We end with our conclusions. In the Appendices, we present analytical expressions for the annihilation cross section of [formula], which is one of the main annihilation channels of the   /  H̃  /  W̃ case. We also show the best fit regions for several intermediate values of the parameter α, which demonstrate that the fits get progressively better as one departs from gaugino universality.

Model and Procedure

Supersymmetric parameters are heavily constrained when one requires Yukawa coupling unification. In the case of  Yukawa unification, one Yukawa coupling gives rise to the top, bottom and the tau masses. The only way to reproduce the hierarchy between the top and the bottom masses is by requiring large   ~  50. At large , the GUT scale SUSY parameters are further constrained. For example, in the large  regime the down quark mass matrix and the CKM matrix elements receive significant corrections [\cite=Blazek:1995nv]. Thus, requiring that the Yukawa couplings unify in addition to gauge coupling unification removes a lot of freedom from the GUT scale parameters.

The model parameters are summarized in [\ref=tab:parameters]. The model is defined by three gauge parameters, αG,MG,ε3, where [formula], and [formula] is the GUT scale threshold corrections to the gauge couplings. There is one large Yukawa coupling, λ, such that, λt(MG)  =  λb(MG)  =  λτ(MG)  =  λ. Typically, there are small corrections to this relation at the GUT scale, coming from the off-diagonal Yukawa couplings to the first two families. Here we consider a third family model, since the SUSY spectrum (and relic abundance) does not heavily depend on these small off-diagonal Yukawa couplings. SUSY parameters defined at the GUT scale include a universal scalar mass for squarks and sleptons, m16; universal gaugino mass, M1 / 2; m10, the universal Higgs mass; A0, universal trilinear scalar coupling and D, the magnitude of Higgs splitting. Note that non-universal Higgs masses are necessary in order for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in these models. We will also consider in general a parameter α that determines the ratio of anomaly mediation to gravity mediation contribution to the gaugino masses. The parameters μ,  tan β are obtained at the weak scale by consistent electroweak symmetry breaking. In the case of  unification,  is restricted to be around 50.

We follow the same procedure used in Ref.[\cite=Anandakrishnan:2013cwa] to calculate 12 low energy observables. We use the 2-loop MSSM RGEs for both dimensionful and dimensionless parameters, integrate out the heavy scalars at their masses, evolve all parameters to the weak scale without the first two generation scalars. We use maton    to perform the RGE evolution, calculation of the couplings at the weak scale and the masses of the gauge bosons, top, bottom quarks and the τ lepton. For the calculation of Higgs mass, we define an effective theory at the scale [formula] and interface our calculation with the code by authors in Ref.[\cite=Bernal:2007uv]. The flavor observables are calculated using the code susy_flavor [\cite=Crivellin:2012jv],  and the relic abundance is computed using MicrOmegas[\cite=Belanger:2010pz]. A χ2 function is constructed by comparing the predicted observables, yi (except the relic abundance) with their measured values, [formula], given by the standard definition:

[formula]

where σi, is the assumed uncertainty in the calculation of the observable. The χ2 function is minimized to determine the best set of GUT scale parameters. This minimization procedure is carried out using MINUIT [\cite=James:1975dr]. The input parameters are listed in [\ref=tab:parameters], and the observables and the theoretical errors assumed in estimating them are summarized in [\ref=tab:allobservables]. Note that the model is defined in terms of 12 parameters of which, some are fixed during the minimization procedure. We compare our predictions to 11 observables, and calculate the 68%, 90%, and 95% confidence level intervals using the χ2 function for the appropriate number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.).

The main constraints on the SUSY spectrum come from fitting the third family masses, the Higgs mass, and the flavor observables b  →  sγ and Bs  →  μ+μ-. Fitting the t - b - τ masses requires that  be around 50, in order to reproduce the hierarchy between the top and the bottom masses, when λt(MG)  =  λb(MG). In addition, fitting the bottom mass and the Higgs mass simultaneously requires light gluinos [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2012tj]. The flavor physics observable b  →  sγ in MSSM is enhanced by a chargino-stop loop at large , and requires that the stops (and consequently all scalars) be heavier than a few TeV. Bs  →  μ+μ- rate is also enhanced at large , and constrains CP odd Higgs mass, [formula] 1.2 TeV. This pushes the model to the decoupling regime (MA >  > MZ), and the lightest Higgs is predicted to be SM-like.

Well-tempering in SUSY Models

The lightest neutralino in the MSSM is a mixture of the Bino ([formula]), Wino (W̃), and Higgsino (,) eigenstates

[formula]

where the N1i are the relevant weights along the different directions.

There are essentially three options for obtaining the observed relic density: (i) thermal single-component DM: the lightest neutralino is the sole DM candidate and the observed relic density is obtained by thermal freeze-out. (ii) non-thermal single-component DM: the lightest neutralino is the sole DM candidate and has a non-thermal cosmological history. Both cases of thermal under-production and over-production can be accommodated in this case. (iii) multi-component DM: the relic density is satisfied by the lightest neutralino along with one or more additional candidates, motivated by other physics (not necessarily supersymmetry). We will be interested in option (i) above, reserving the study of non-thermal DM in these models for future work.

If [formula] is a pure Higgsino, i.e. N11  =  N12  =  0, the thermal relic density is approximately given by [formula] Clearly, TeV-scale Higgsinos are required to satisfy the thermal relic density. A pure Higgsino LSP with a thermal history is thus somewhat in conflict with naturalness arguments . Similarly, for a pure Wino, i.e. N11  =  N13  =  N14  ~  0, the thermal relic density is satisfied for masses around 2.5 TeV. A pure Bino over-produces DM in the scenario considered in this paper, with decoupled supersymmetric scalar and Higgs sectors.

The correct relic density can be obtained if [formula] is an appropriate admixture of Bino, Wino, and Higgsino states. There are three possibilities here: a   /  H̃,   /  W̃, and a   /  H̃  /  W̃ DM candidate. The idea is that an over-abundant Bino acquires a larger Wino or Higgsino component, allowing it to annihilate rapidly to Z,W, and h final states. For the case of   /  H̃ DM, the low-energy values of M1 and μ are required to be close to each other, typically to within 10%.   /  W̃ DM requires M1  ~  M2 and gives the correct relic density mainly through coannihilation of [formula] with [formula] and [formula].

Light Higgsinos and   /  H̃ DM with Universal Gaugino Masses

In this section, we discuss the case of well tempered DM in Yukawa unified SUSY GUTs with universal gaugino masses. Since   /  W̃ DM requires M1  ~  M2 at low energies, it cannot be obtained if one assumes gaugino unification at the GUT scale. The remaining option then is   /  H̃ DM. This requires light Higgsinos. There is however, a very strong tension in obtaining   /  H̃ DM in these models. This tension arises from an unusual candidate: the corrections to the bottom quark mass.

It is well known that there are corrections to the bottom quark mass from a gluino-sbottom loop and a chargino-stop loop in MSSM that are O() enhanced. These large corrections can be written as

[formula]

where [formula], mt̃ and [formula] are the sbottom, stop, and gluino masses respectively. When the stop and sbottom masses are roughly degenerate ~  , we can rewrite the above expression as

[formula]

Light Higgsinos (small μ) suppresses these corrections, which have to be at about a few % (and negative), and are necessary to fit the bottom quark mass. This requirement places stringent constraints on the SUSY boundary conditions in the large  regime. When the scalars are heavy, and when μ is small, one needs some fine-tuning between the gluino mass, [formula] and the At parameter to generate these corrections. Collider constraints from LHC place significant lower bounds on the gluino mass, which is required to be heavier than ~  1000 GeV in these models. Therefore, to get the correct ~   few % corrections, the trilinear coupling has to be large (and negative). When the absolute value of the trilinear coupling is forced to be larger than [formula] (maximal mixing), it drives the Higgs mass to smaller values (or equivalently, the bad fit can be transferred to the bottom and tau mass). This tension between the bottom quark mass and the Higgs mass disfavors light Higgsinos in these models.

This tension is reinforced further when one considers well tempering in this context. If one does take the Higgsinos with mass ~  400 GeV or greater, Binos are constrained to have similar mass, to give a well tempered DM. Due to gaugino universality, the gluinos then have mass ~  1300  -  2000 GeV (but cannot be too much lighter), further forcing trilinear terms to go beyond maximal mixing. These tensions are reflected in [\ref=alpha0] with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, where the the best fit points are displayed in the M1 / 2  -  μ plane. The region between the red lines has relic density in the range Ωh2  =  0.08    -    0.2. The relic abundance is satisfied in this region due to a well tempering of Bino/Higgsino DM (due to universal conditions, the Bino-Wino mass splitting is too large to allow coannihilation). The olive curves are contours of constant gluino mass. In the plot, the regions under the blue contours (lightest to darkest) represent χ2 / d.o.f.  =  1.2, 2.3, 3 corresponding to 68%, 90%, and 95% CLs, respectively. The regions were obtained by a parameter space scan with two degrees of freedom (m16,μ, and M1 / 2 were held fixed). Well tempering is obtained for comparable Bino and Higgsino masses, which gives gluinos in the mass range of 1600 - 2000 GeV. The situation is worse for pure Higgsino DM which have to be heavier than a TeV and thus requiring even heavier gauginos. Therefore, in comparison with the phenomenological scenarios of CMSSM and NUHM, Yukawa unified GUTs are further constrained. Note that in the case of CMSSM and NUHM it has been pointed out that a TeV scale Higgsino LSP is preferred since it is unconstrained by current experiments and the correct Higgs mass can be easily obtained in this region [\cite=Roszkowski:2009sm] [\cite=Kowalska:2013hha].

We find from our χ2 analysis that in this case, the worst fits are to mb(mb), and Mτ, and αs all of which have pulls ≫  1. It is also clear from [\ref=alpha0] that regions with [formula] GeV generally give large χ2 / d.o.f.  >  3 in these scenarios. It is abundantly clear that there is tension between requiring Yukawa unification and a well tempered DM, when one starts with universal gaugino masses. To retain the thermal single component DM scenario in these models, one must move away from the gaugino mass unification assumption at the GUT scale.

/  H̃  /  W̃ and   /  W̃ DM

In this section, we relax gaugino mass universality at the GUT scale to add the possibility of having   /  H̃  /  W̃ or   /  W̃ DM candidates. A particularly well-motivated boundary condition is combining a universal (modulus) contribution with varying degrees of anomaly-mediated contributions. To this end, we first give some basic details about mixed modulus-anomaly or mirage mediation. We then give our main results for   /  H̃  /  W̃ and   /  W̃ DM.

Effective Mirage Mediation

Non-universal gaugino masses could arise when there is a non-singlet F-term under the GUT symmetry or when there are hybrid SUSY breaking mechanisms. States in non-singlet representations of the gauge symmetry could contribute large threshold corrections to the gauge couplings and could ruin precision gauge coupling unification. Hence we depart from gaugino universality by assuming that there is a hybrid SUSY breaking mechanism at the GUT scale like the "mirage" mediation scenarios studied in string-inspired effective supergravity models [\cite=Choi:2007ka] [\cite=Lowen:2008fm] [\cite=Baer:2006tb]. The boundary conditions considered here have been recently studied within Yukawa unified SUSY GUTs [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2013cwa]. Non-universal gaugino mass scenarios were considered in the context of GUTs in the analyses of Refs. [\cite=Badziak:2011wm] [\cite=Gogoladze:2011ce] [\cite=Gogoladze:2011aa] [\cite=Ajaib:2013zha] [\cite=Guchait:2011hj], where the SUSY breaking F-term that couples to the gaugino transforms as a non-singlet of the unified SO(10) gauge group, and hence gives rise to non-universal masses.

The gaugino masses at the GUT scale obey a "mirage" pattern:

[formula]

In the above expression, α is a parameter that controls the relative importance of the universal and anomalous contributions, and bi  =  (33 / 5,1, - 3)  for  i  =  1,2,3, are the relevant β-function coefficients. We note that larger α leads to larger anomaly mediated contributions (and hence departure from the universal scenarios). The definition of α has appeared in different forms in the literature. The above expression matches with the definition in Ref. [\cite=Choi:2007ka] (with the assumption, however, that m3 / 2≃m16), but is related to the definition in Ref. [\cite=Lowen:2008fm] by the transformation [formula]. For the scalars, we assume a universal mass and trilinear coupling at the GUT scale. Note that, while the gaugino and scalar soft terms can be obtained from the heterotic framework of Ref. [\cite=Lowen:2008fm], the issue of obtaining large A terms is still a model building challenge. Here, we let the phenomenology guide our choice of large trilinears at the GUT scale.

The additional degree of freedom α, allows well-tempering by tuning the ratios of M1 and M2. To limit the regions of interest, we illustrate in [\ref=m123], the ratio of M1 and M2 and the value of M3 obtained at the weak scale by a simple 1-loop analysis. We are interested in the regions where |M1|  ≤  |M2|, when the lightest neutralino starts to be a blend of Bino and Wino. This ratio of |M1| and |M2| is obtained when α is less than 3, below which the Wino becomes significantly lighter. [\ref=m123] also shows that simultaneously satisfying the collider bound on the gluino mass further restricts M1 / 2  >  250 GeV. Note that the plot shows M3 and there are additional corrections to the gluino pole mass. Once we identify the region of interest in the M1 / 2  -  α parameter space we proceed to check if this region of the effective mirage mediation model is compatible with Yukawa unification. As an aside, we note that in Ref. [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2013cwa], it was assumed that μ,  M1 / 2  <  0, and α  ≥  4 such that M3  >  0,M1,M2  <  0. This combination was useful to simultaneously satisfy the b  →  sγ constraint and the corrections to bottom quark mass. These boundary conditions led to very distinct spectrum and interesting phenomenology but as noted earlier, large values of α lead to anomaly mediation being the dominant source of SUSY breaking, and thus a pure Wino-like LSP. Therefore, they are outside the range of this work on thermal single component dark matter.

As α is gradually increased from 0, there are two important effects that become apparent. The first one is that the Wino component of the LSP begins to increase. Therefore, the correct relic density is obtained for larger values of μ (compared to the universal case). Due to the constraints on light Higgsinos, this is preferable. On the other hand, since the beta-function coefficient is negative for SU(3), the gluino mass decreases with increasing α. Then the model starts conflicting with the LHC results as α increases. Below are our results for the case of α  =  1.5 in [\ref=mirage]. In Appendix [\ref=appotheralpha], we discuss the intermediate values of α  =  0.5 and α  =  1, where we find progressively improving (compared to the α  =  0 case) results for the χ2 fit. There, we also show that the model starts to conflict severely with the LHC results at around α  ~  2. There is a finite volume of parameter space that permits well-tempering and the entire volume is within the reach of the LHC and DM experiments.

Results for   /  H̃  /  W̃ DM

The gaugino masses are maximally split in the universal case. As anomaly contributions increase with increasing α, the mass splitting between the gaugino masses decrease. Due to the greater proximity of Bino and Wino masses, now, in fact,   /  H̃  /  W̃ and   /  W̃ DM can both be options for the well tempered DM candidate. Moreover, for the same Bino mass, the gluino can now be lighter ([formula] GeV), reducing the tension with fitting the b mass. Indeed, we find now that we find better fits to all the observables in [\ref=tab:allobservables]. This is reflected in [\ref=alpha1.5] where we present fits with α  =  1.5. The region between the blue and red lines gives Ωh2  =  0.08    -    0.2. We see that this region now extends to areas of smaller χ2, with gluino mass ~  1100 GeV. As in the universal case α  =  0, the region with low [formula] GeV gives a large value of χ2 and this region is qualitatively similar to the universal case. However, with larger [formula] GeV a region of low χ2 opens up and the relic density band extends into it.

We present a sample benchmark point in [\ref=benchmarkspectrumbhw]. The best fit point obtained here is very similar to the benchmark points discussed in Dermisek-Raby model with universal gaugino masses [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2012tj]. The SUSY boundary conditions at the GUT scale are typically:

[formula]

The first two family of scalars are very heavy (~   20 TeV), and the spectrum has the inverted scalar mass hierarchy with the third family of squarks and sleptons between 3 - 6 TeV. These scalars are out of the reach of the LHC. The gauginos are light and the LSP (the DM candidate) is a well tempered   /  H̃  /  W̃ mixture. The gaugino sector differs from the previous studies, and we are able to satisfy the relic abundance. The gluino tends to be lighter than the universal case due to the presence of the anomaly contribution. We have increased the overall scale of the gauginos, and the LSP mass but the gluino remains light enough to contribute the required corrections to the bottom quark mass. Note that all the extra Higgses of SUSY are heavy and thus the lightest Higgs is purely SM like. Finally, the gluino decays into a variety of final states. The final states should include many jets, b-jets and a large amount of missing energy, and large total transverse jet momentum. We expect the bounds from present LHC results to be similar to the model discussed in [\cite=Anandakrishnan:2013nca] and we expect the 20 fb- 1 data from 8 TeV LHC to rule out gluinos lighter than 1 TeV.

/  H̃  /  W̃ DM Annihilation and Scattering Cross Sections

The main annihilation channels of [formula] in this region are displayed in [\ref=Zh_cross_section].

The left panel shows the annihilation cross section [formula] as a function of the relic density. The cross section is enhanced for large Bino/Higgsino mixing. As the Higgsino becomes decoupled, the cross section for this annihilation channel becomes negligible. These results have been obtained using MicrOmegas and we have verified the result theoretically; the main formulae are collected in Appendix [\ref=appZhcalculation]. The right panel shows the relative importance of the Zh  +  t channel and the ZW channel as a function of the relic density. For low relic density, the coannihilation channels [formula] dominate. The DM is then a Bino/Wino well tempered neutralino. For larger separation between Bino and Wino, the coannihilation becomes ineffective and the relic density increases as [formula] becomes predominantly Bino. The main annihilation channel then becomes [formula]. We note that at the sweet spot Ωh2  ~  0.1, the annihilation to Zh and coannihilation to ZW are comparable, indicating that the DM is a well tempered Bino/Wino/Higgsino type.

In [\ref=darkmatterannihilation], we display the annihilation channels and scattering cross section of the DM candidate corresponding to the benchmark point in [\ref=benchmarkspectrumbhw]. The main annihilation channel is [formula] with a value of 〈σv〉Zh  =  1.02  ×  10- 26 cm3s- 1. For the benchmark point, the spin independent scattering cross-section is 1.6  ×  10- 8 pb. We note that the scattering cross-section for this [formula] is just at the exclusion limit at 90% CL from XENON100 [\cite=Aprile:2012nq]. Direct detection bounds for well tempered scenarios are getting particularly stringent. For μ  >  0, XENON100 exclusion limits force [formula] GeV in the large    limit [\cite=Cheung:2012qy]. Typically, Bino/Higgsino mixing larger than 10% starts to conflict with exclusion bounds from XENON100 in these regions [\cite=Dutta:2013sta] [\cite=Han:2013gba] (for our benchmark scenario, the degree of Bino/Higgsino mixing is ~  8%). We thus see that the   /  H̃  /  W̃ well-tempering is particularly interesting since it is likely to be conclusively probed by XENON1T [\cite=Aprile:2012zx]. In fact, by changing α, one can control the degree to which Bino/Wino coannihilation contributes to the relic density, and also the scattering cross section.

Results for   /  W̃ DM

As α increases further, the wino starts becoming a substantial component of the LSP and the relic abundance is satisfied for larger values of μ. In this region we obtain a   /  W̃ DM. A typical spectrum is shown in [\ref=benchmarkspectrum2]. Note that we have chosen a higher scale for the supersymmetric scalar masses, m16, so as to obtain a better fit to the Higgs mass. This also gives rise to larger corrections to the gluino mass. The gluino is [formula] 1100 GeV, in spite of α  >  2, in comparison with [\ref=otheralpha], where m16 was chosen to be 20 TeV. The other qualitative features of the spectrum remain unchanged. The main channels as well as the spin independent scattering cross section are shown in [\ref=darkmatterannihilation2]. The annihilation cross section of the DM is dominated by various coannihilation processes among [formula] and [formula]. The spin independent scattering cross section is well below XENON100 limits, as expected in this case.

We have studied the viability of a thermal DM candidate in Yukawa unified SUSY GUTS. Given the model parameters at the GUT scale, we have used the low energy observables MW, MZ,  GF, α- 1em, αs(MZ), Mt, mb(mb), Mτ, b  →  sγ, BR(Bs  →  μ+μ-) and Mh to constrain the parameter space. It is well known that uniformly heavy scalars and decoupled SUSY Higgs sector are required in these models to evade flavor physics constraints from b  →  sγ, BR(Bs  →  μ+μ-). The heavy scalars make it impossible to achieve coanhhilation scenarios with staus or the CP-odd Higgs. The model also prefers a light gaugino spectrum and therefore disfavors Higgsino LSP. Then, the remaining option to obtain a thermal DM candidate in these models is to consider a well-tempered neutralino that is either   /  H̃ or   /  W̃ or   /  H̃  /  W̃ admixture.

The first observation is that light Higgsinos with mass [formula] GeV are difficult to obtain in these models. In particular, the tension arises from simultaneously obtaining acceptable corrections to the bottom quark mass and the mass of the Higgs, as well as evading the lower bound on the mass of the gluino mass. This is clearly represented in [\ref=alpha0], where Higgsino masses less than ~  O(500) GeV uniformly have a large χ2 / d.o.f. for gluino mass [formula] GeV. This makes light well-tempered   /  H̃ DM less preferred; and hence, universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale also less preferred, since   /  H̃ DM is the only well-tempered option with that boundary condition.

We studied the cases of   /  H̃  /  W̃ and   /  W̃ DM by allowing for non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, in a mirage pattern. Non-universality of the gauginos at the GUT scale is required to compress the mass splitting between the Bino and the Wino. We find that there are small regions of parameter space that can accommodate all the low energy observables including a 125 GeV Higgs that do not conflict with the LHC constraints on the gluino. In both cases there is a considerable degree of fine-tuning between the Higgsino, third generation squark, and gluino masses in order to satisfy all the constraints.

The best fit regions require a light gluino. The lower bound on the gluino mass is growing from the LHC data and the 14 TeV run at the LHC will conclusively test the regions discussed here. For gluino ~   1.3 TeV, we find tensions in obtaining a 125 GeV Higgs mass, in spite of the heavy scalars in the model. Our findings are that the trilinear coupling At is pushed beyond maximal mixing, and hence drives the Higgs mass to smaller values. On the other hand, the   /  H̃  /  W̃ will also be probed by XENON1T. While there are still small pockets of the parameter space with accidental degeneracies, we find that these are considerably fine-tuned and may even require DM with mass larger than a TeV. It is important to note that independent of the thermal dark matter viability, these models will be severely constrained by the absence of a gluino at the next run of the LHC. Hints of the gluino at the next run of the LHC without any immediate detection from direct DM searches would leave only the   /  W̃ as a viable scenario.

Annihilation channel [formula]

In this section, we present the analytical expression for the annihilation cross section of DM into Zh final states, following [\cite=Kamionkowski:1991nj]. The annihilation of DM into Zh final state occurs due to two contributions: s-channel exchange of a Z and t- and u- channel exchange of all four neutralinos. The cross section in the limit of vrel  →  0 is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the momentum of the outgoing particles. In the limit of heavy Higgs partners, the quantity X is given by

[formula]

The various quantities in [\ref=XinZh] are: (i) the coupling at the hZZ vertex z  =  gmZ sin β   -   α  /   cos θW (g is the SU(2)L coupling constant), (ii) the coupling of the [formula] vertex Fij  =  g(Zi3Zj3  -  Zi4Zj4) / 2 cos θW, (iii) the coupling at the [formula] vertex Mijk available in [\cite=Griest:1989zh], and (iv) [formula]. The sum is over all neutralinos.

α  =  0.5, 1 & 2

In the main text, we have given the examples of α  =  0 (universal gaugino masses) and α  =  1.5. The problems with the universal gaugino mass case were described, and the eventual benchmark at α  =  1.5 was presented. In this Appendix, we give the results for several intermediate values of α. We note that the region with relic densty Ωh2  =  0.08    -    0.2 starts extending more and more into the region with small χ2, as the b-mass fitting improves due to the reasons mentioned in the text. For α  =  2.0, the χ2 fit is the best; however, the trade off is that the gluino becomes too light.
