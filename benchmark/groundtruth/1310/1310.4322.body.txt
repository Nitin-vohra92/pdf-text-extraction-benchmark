Carbon Monoxide Clouds at Low-Metallicity in the WLM Galaxy

Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) is an isolated dwarf galaxy at the edge of the Local Group[\cite=leaman12]. It has a low star formation rate because of its small size, and like other dwarf Irregulars (dIrr), no previous evidence[\cite=tk01] for the molecular gas that always accompanies young stars in larger galaxies[\cite=bigiel11]. One problem is that the dominant tracer of such gas is carbon monoxide (CO), and dIrr galaxies have low carbon and oxygen abundances relative to hydrogen. No galaxy with O / H abundance less than 20% has been detected in CO[\cite=taylor98] [\cite=leroy11] [\cite=schruba12]. Far more abundant is H2, but this does not have an observable state of excitation at the low temperatures ([formula] K) required for star formation.

To search for star-forming gas, we surveyed WLM for CO(J  =  3 - 2) and continuum dust emission at 345 GHz using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope at Llano de Chajnantor, Chile, with the the Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI[\cite=vassilev]) and the Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA[\cite=siringo]). We also used a map of dust emission at 160  μm from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy Survey[\cite=dale09], and a map of atomic hydrogen re-reduced from the archives of the Jansky Very Large Array radio telescope. The dust measurements convert to a dust temperature and dust mass, and after applying a suitable gas-to-dust ratio, convert to a gas mass from which the HI mass can be subtracted to give the H2 mass for comparison to CO.

Figure 1 shows WLM and the two regions where we detected CO(3-2) emission, along with HI, far-infrared and sub-mm images. Observed and derived parameters are in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The peak CO brightness temperature in each detected region is [formula] - 0.015 K and the FWHM linewidth is [formula] km s- 1. Previous efforts to detect CO(1-0) in WLM[\cite=tk01] partially overlapped Region A with a 45" aperture and concluded a 5σ upper limit to the CO(1-0) intensity of 0.18 K km s- 1. Our observation with an 18" aperture measures [formula] K km s- 1 for CO(3-2) in the same region. The difference arises because the CO cloud is unresolved even by our 18" beam - we did not detect comparable CO(3-2) intensities in our searches adjacent to Region A. The previous upper limit corresponds to a maximum CO(1-0) luminosity of 8300 K km s- 1 pc2 inside 45" (which is 215 pc at WLM), whereas the cloud we detect has a CO(3-2) luminosity [formula] times smaller, 1500 K km s- 1 pc2. Likewise, the previous null detection[\cite=tk01] in CO(2-1) claimed a 5σ upper limit that is about the same as our CO(3-2) detection, but their closest pointing differed from our Region A by [formula] pc (14" or half the beam diameter at CO(2-1)), which could have been enough to take it off the cloud.

The 160  μm, 870 μm and HI peaks are slightly offset from the CO positions, indicating variations in temperature and molecular fraction. A large HI and FIR cloud that surrounds Region A, designated A1, was used to measure dust temperature, [formula]K, which was assumed to apply throughout the region (the 160  μm observation does not resolve Region A so a more localized temperature measurement is not possible). Td was determined from the 870  μm and 160  μm fluxes corrected for the CO(3-2) line and broadband free-free emission (Table 1) assuming a modified black body function with dust emissivity proportional to the power β of frequency. Local measurements[\cite=planck] suggest β = 1.78  ±  0.08, although a range is possible[\cite=draine03] [\cite=galametz12], depending on grain temperature and properties[\cite=coupeaud11]. The 870  μm flux was also corrected for an unexplained FIR and sub-mm excess that is commonly observed in other low metallicity galaxies[\cite=galametz11] [\cite=verdugo12]. An alternate combination of lower β with no sub-mm correction[\cite=plan11] gives similar results (suppl. material). The dust mass was calculated from an emissivity[\cite=draine03] of κ = 13.9 cm2 gm- 1 at 140  μm, and converted to 870  μm with the same power law index β. The dust mass for Region A is then Mdust,A = S870,AD2  /  κBν(Td) for flux S870,A, distance D, and Black-Body function Bν.

Dust mass is converted to gas mass with a factor equal to the gas-to-dust mass ratio, RGD. An approximation[\cite=leroy11] is to assume the solar value[\cite=draine07] (1 / 0.007) increased by the inverse of the metallicity of WLM (0.13), which would give 1100. We use this approximation here, but allow for a scaling factor to the gas mass, δGD = RGD / 1100; i.e., the gas-to-dust ratio normalized to the Milky Way and scaled to the metallicity.

The results are in Table 2 assuming β = 1.8 as the fiducial value, and also β = 1.6 and 2 to illustrate the dependence of the results on β. Dust and gas mass correlate[\cite=galametz12] with the assumed β. The total gas mass column density in a 22" region around position A is [formula] pc- 2 for β = 1.8. Atomic hydrogen contributes [formula] pc- 2, and the remainder is ascribed to molecular H2 traced by the observed CO.

The integral under the CO(3-2) line from Cloud A is [formula] K km s- 1. This has to be converted to CO(1-0) before comparing it with H2 mass in the conventional way. We take as a guide[\cite=nikolic] the CO(3-2)/CO(1-0)[formula] ratio in another low metallicity galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud[\cite=dufour84] (SMC, where O/H= 20%). The result, 0.25 K km s- 1, is combined with the H2 mass column density to determine the conversion factor, αCO, from CO(1-0) to H2. If αCO can be calibrated as a function of metallicity, then CO observations can be used directly to infer the molecular gas content irrespective of the dust spectral energy distribution. Extensive compilations[\cite=taylor98] [\cite=leroy11] [\cite=schruba12] show αCO increasing strongly at lower metallicity, from [formula] in the Milky Way[\cite=leroy11] where the metallicity[\cite=asplund09] is 12 +  log (O / H) = 8.69, down to the previous CO detection limit[\cite=leroy11] in the SMC where [formula] at 12 +  log (O / H) = 8.0. Our observations of WLM[\cite=lee05] at 12 +  log (O / H) = 7.8 continue this trend.

Taking the H2 column density from the residual between the dust-derived total and the HI column density, [formula] pc- 2, and dividing by the inferred CO(1-0) line integral of 0.25 K km s- 1, we obtain [formula] including Helium and heavy elements, with a range in αCO from 34 to 271 as β varies from 1.6 to 2. The corresponding XCO factor for H2 column density conversion from ICO would be [formula] cm- 2 [formula], with a range from [formula] to [formula] with β. There is a large uncertainty because of the unknown dust properties (β, κ, δGD, sub-mm excess) and molecular excitation (CO(3-2)/CO(1-0)) in dIrr galaxies.

The star formation rate based on the Hα and FUV[\cite=hunter10] fluxes within an 18" diameter aperture centered on Cloud A is [formula] yr- 1. Dividing these rates into the CO-associated molecular mass with [formula] pc- 2 (K km s- 1)- 1 gives a CO-molecular consumption time of 4.6-3.8 Gyr for region A. In Region B, the star formation rates by these two tracers are [formula] yr- 1 and the CO-molecular consumption time is 6.7-1.5 Gyr. These times are only slightly larger than the average value in spiral galaxies[\cite=leroy08], which is [formula] Gyr, but they are 10  ×   larger than the rate per molecule in local giant molecular clouds[\cite=lada12], which is a more direct analogy with our observations.

The detection of CO in WLM suggests that star formation continues to occur in dense molecular gas even at lower metallicities than previously observed. The similarity between the metallicities of dIrr galaxies like WLM and those of larger galaxies at high redshift[\cite=mannucci09] implies that we should be able to study star formation in young galaxies using the usual techniques.

Table 2 notes: a The units of αCO are [formula]; the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainties in the 160  μm and 870  μm fluxes, as indicated by their error limits in Table 1; the error limits are approximately symmetric. b The dust temperature in region A is assumed to be the same as the measured dust temperature in region A1. c δGD = RGD / 1100 is the gas to dust ratio RGD normalized to that of the Milky Way scaled to the metallicity of WLM. Lowering δGD lowers αCO, but this does not seem reasonable: Engelbracht et al.[\cite=eng] show a correlation suggesting [formula] when [formula], and this implies larger [formula] and αCO. The gas mass and resulting αCO also depend on the assumed correction factor of 1.7 for sub-mm excess. With no sub-mm excess correction, αCO increases for all β: at β = 1.8, αCO = 370. Solutions with no sub-mm excess correction and lower β[\cite=plan11] are in the Supplementary material. In addition, αCO depends on the assumed ratio CO(3-2)/CO(1-0), which was taken to be 0.8 for the table; a value of CO(3-2)/CO(1-0)= 1 increases αCO to 155 for β = 1.8. d The HI mass column density is corrected for He and heavy elements. e The molecular mass for region B was calculated using the CO integrated intensity and the value of αCO determined from Region A.
