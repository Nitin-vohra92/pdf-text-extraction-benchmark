Cycles in Projective Spaces

Introduction

In recent years, several articles have been written on the study of embeddings of cycles, and other families of graphs, into finite affine and projective planes. For example, Lazebnik, Mellinger, and the fourth author proved in [\cite=LMV13] that finite planes (both affine and projective) admit embeddings of cycles of all possible lengths. They also found, in [\cite=LMV09], close expressions for the number of k-cycles in any projective plane, for k = 3,4,5,6. This work was later expanded by Voropaev in [\cite=V13] to k = 7,8,9,10. In addition, the work of the fourth author with Peabody and White in [\cite=PVW13] shows interesting connections between these embeddings and the structure of the finite field coordinatizing the 'host' plane.

Not much is known (really, nothing at all for n > 2) about embeddings of cycles into PG(n,q). For n = 2, besides the articles mentioned in the previous paragraph, Singer's work [\cite=Singer38] implies the existence of cycles of maximal length in PG(2,q), and Schmeichel [\cite=Schm89] proved pancyclicity of PG(2,q) for when q is prime. We refer the reader to [\cite=LMV13] for a thorough introduction to embeddings of graphs into finite structures.

We start with a few definitions, conventions, and well-known facts. Any concept we miss to define may be found in [\cite=B98], [\cite=Demb], or [\cite=H].

A graph G is a finite collection of vertices together with edges connecting pairs of vertices. We denote the set of vertices of G by V(G), and the set of edges of G by E(G). A k-cycle Ck is a graph on k vertices and k edges such that every vertex has degree two. We will say that k is the length of Ck.

Throughout this article, q will always be the power of a prime, and GF(q) will denote the field of order q.

For n  ≥  3, we let V to be an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over GF(q). The n-dimensional finite projective space, denoted PG(n,q), is the geometry constructed from V as follows:

its points are the 1-dimensional subspaces of V,

its lines are the 2-dimensional subspaces of V,

in general, its k-dimensional projective subspaces are the (k + 1)-dimensional subspaces of V, for all [formula].

Incidence is given by standard set-theoretical inclusion.

The construction above is also valid for n = 2. However, in this case we cannot say that PG(2,q) is the projective plane, as there may be several non-isomorphic projective planes constructed on the same set of points (this is not the case for dimension 3 and above). From now on we assume n  ≥  3.

Just like projective planes, PG(n,q) is very symmetric. The following results are not too hard to prove (and may be found in [\cite=H]).

PG(n,q) contains

[formula]

Note that there are more lines than points.

Every line of PG(n,q) contains exactly q + 1 points.

Every plane of PG(n,q) is isomorphic to PG(2,q).

A collineation of PG(n,q) is a permutation of the points of PG(n,q) that preserves incidence. The group of all collineations of PG(n,q) is denoted Aut(PG(n,q)).

Now that we have seen the main two objects we will study, we define the way they will interact with each other.

Let P denote the set of points in PG(n,q) and L denote the set of lines in PG(n,q). We will say that a graph G = (V,E) is embedded (or embeds) into PG(n,q) if there is an injective map φ:V  →  P, that, by preserving incidence, induces a injective map [formula]. In the case such a function exists we will call it an embedding of G into PG(n,q), and write [formula], or just [formula] when the context allows it.

If [formula], we will identify G with φ(G), the vertex v with the point φ(v), and the edge e connecting vertices v and w with the whole line φ(v)φ(w). Hence, when the context allows it, we will call points in PG(n,q) vertices, and lines in PG(n,q) edges.

We can now start studying embeddings of cycles into PG(n,q). Our ultimate goal, in this article, is to prove the following result.

PG(n,q) is pancyclic. That is, k-cycles embed in PG(n,q), for all [formula].

Our approach to embedding cycles into projective spaces is of a recursive nature. It is based on the results in [\cite=LMV13] and the few results in the following short section.

Cycles in PG(2,q)

Let π be a projective plane in PG(3,q), isomorphic to PG(2,q), with 'origin' O and line at infinity [formula]. Following the notation in [\cite=LMV13], we will denote the lines through O by li, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  q + 1, and the points [formula] by (i).

The proof of Theorem 1 in [\cite=LMV13] not only shows that a k-cycle Ck may be embedded in an affine plane of order q, for all 3  ≤  k  ≤  q2. In fact, a close analysis of this proof also yields that Ck may be embedded in one of the following two ways:

O is a vertex of Ck, and there is at least one line through O that is not an edge of Ck.

O is not a vertex of Ck, k = t(q + 1), for some 1  ≤  t  ≤  q - 1, and no line through O is an edge of Ck.

Next is the result we really need for later on.

For every 3  ≤  k  ≤  q2 + 2, a path on k vertices can be embedded into π in such a way that its endpoints lay on [formula] and no other point on [formula] is a vertex of this path.

The cases k = 3,4 are trivial, so let 5  ≤  k  ≤  q2 + 2 and consider a (k - 2)-cycle C with the characteristics mentioned in Remark [\ref=rem1]. If O is a vertex of C. Let li and lj be the two edges of C through O, and let lt be a line through O that is not an edge of C. Now delete the edge li from C to get a path P on k - 2 vertices. Then the path

[formula]

has length k and the desired properties. If O is not a vertex of C then we consider three 'consecutive' vertices in C: Pi,Pt, and Pj, which are on the lines through O labeled by li,lt, and lj, respectively. We delete the edges PiPt and PtPj, and the vertex Pt, from C to get a path P on k - 3 vertices with endpoints Pi and Pj. Then the path

[formula]

has length k and the desired properties.

We now have enough to address our main problem.

Cycles in PG(n,q)

In order to construct cycles in PG(n,q) we will 'glue' paths on certain projective subspaces of PG(n,q), that have been arranged in a 'nice' way. For this strategy to work, we need the following remark.

Given a projective subspace [formula] of PG(n + 1,q), there are exactly q + 1 n-dimensional projective subspaces (all isomorphic to PG(n,q)) of PG(n + 1,q) containing Σ. These PG(n,q)s partition the points of [formula]. The collineation group of PG(n + 1,q) is transitive on the set of its n-dimensional projective subspaces.

The following technical lemma is 'folklore', and easy to prove using elementary linear algebra. We include it here for future reference.

Let Π  =  PG(n,q) and let

[formula]

which is isomorphic to PG(n - 1,q). Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then,

Aut(Σ) acts transitively on the set of lines of Σ. Moreover, the stabilizer of a line acts doubly-transitively on the points of such line.

Both Aut(Σ) and AutΣ act on the points of [formula]. Moreover, The orbit of [formula] under AutΣ consists of at least q - 1 elements.

Lemma [\ref=lemPGn-1inPGn] holds for any Σ, isomorphic to PG(n - 1,q), contained in any projective space Π that is isomorphic to PG(n,q).

Let [formula]. For every 3  ≤  k  ≤  qn + 2, we can construct a k-cycle on PG(n,q) with exactly two points of Σ as vertices, and exactly one line of Σ as edge.

We will proceed by induction on n. The result is true for n = 2 because of Corollary [\ref=cor1]. Hence, we assume it is true for n  ≤  d.

For n = d + 1  ≥  3, we use Remark [\ref=rem5] to 'partition' PG(d + 1,q) into q + 1 copies of PG(d,q), labelled [formula], that share [formula].

If 3  ≤  k  ≤  qd + 2 then the induction hypothesis gives us a k-cycle in Π1 with exactly two points of Σ as vertices, and exactly one line of Σ as edge. Since [formula], this cycle can be seen as a k-cycle in PG(n,q) with exactly two points of Π2 as vertices, and exactly one line of Π2 as edge.

Let qd + 3  ≤  k  ≤  qd + 1 + 2. We write k = αqd  +  β, where 0  ≤  β  <  qd, and 1  ≤  α  ≤  q.

Case 1. β = 0,1,2: First notice that β = 0,1,2 forces α > 1. For every 1  ≤  i  ≤  α - 1 we use the induction hypothesis to get a cycle Ci in Πi of length qd + 2 with exactly two points of Σ as vertices, and exactly one line of Σ as edge. Similarly, we get a cycle Cα in Πα of length qd  +  β with exactly two points of Σ as vertices, and exactly one line of Σ as edge. We now use Lemma [\ref=lemPGn-1inPGn](a) to get all these cycles to share the edge in Σ and the two vertices in Σ. We will call this common edge [formula] and the two common vertices P and Q.

If α  =  2, then we delete [formula] from C1 and from C2, and notice that the union of [formula] and [formula] yields a cycle with the desired length and properties.

If α > 2 then, for every 1 < i  <  α, we delete the three edges incident with P and Q in Ci. The path left will be denoted Ti, and its endpoints will be labeled Ai and Bi. Next we delete the vertex Q with the two edges adjacent to it in C1, the resulting path has endpoints P and B. Then we delete the vertex P with the two edges adjacent to it in Cα, the resulting path has endpoints A and Q.

Now we want to connect B with A2, B2 with A3, B3 with A4, and so on, until connecting Bα - 1 with A. When this is done, we would finally connect P and Q using [formula] to get a cycle of the desired length and properties. However, we still need to prove that the lines needed to create this cycle, in this last part of the construction, have not been previously used.

Note that the line [formula] has not been used so far, as B∈Π1 and A2∉Π1 and all lines previously used connected points on the same Πi. A similar argument applies to all other needed lines. However, it is possible that [formula]. If this is the case then we can use Lemma [\ref=lemPGn-1inPGn](b) to 'move' A3 away from the point [formula]. By labeling this new point as A3 we get that [formula]. We perform this process of 'moving' and labeling α  -  2 times, for all points Ai, 3  ≤  i  ≤  α - 1, and for A. In this way we get the lines needed for this construction to be all distinct. Note that when 'moving' Ai we have already determined i - 2 lines, and thus there are at most i - 2 points that are forbidden for Ai to move to. So, we would need the points to be moved to have at least α - 2  ≤  q - 2 possible final locations (at least that many elements in its orbit), which is granted by Lemma [\ref=lemPGn-1inPGn](b).

Case 2. β  >  2: This construction is almost the same as that in Case 1. The only difference is that, for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  α, we now consider cycles Ci in Πi of length qd + 2 with exactly two points of Σ as vertices, and exactly one line of Σ as edge, and also one cycle Cα + 1 in Πα + 1 of length β with exactly two points of Σ as vertices, and exactly one line of Σ as edge.

Now we are ready to prove our main result.

We will prove this by induction on n. The case n = 2 was proved in [\cite=LMV13]. Hence, we assume the claim is true for n  ≤  d. Now notice that Lemma [\ref=lemshortedcycles] gives us k-cycles for most values of k. We only need to study the cases [formula].

For n = d + 1  ≥  3, we 'partition' PG(d + 1,q) into q + 1 copies of PG(d,q), labelled [formula], that share [formula]. We also write k = qd + 1  +  β, where [formula]. Notice that the induction hypothesis yields β-cycles in Πq + 1, for all [formula].

Let [formula] be a line of the β-cycle Cq + 1 in Πq + 1. WLOG, [formula] is a line of [formula]. We use Lemma [\ref=lemshortedcycles] to get a cycle C with length qd + 1 + 2 in PG(d + 1,q) with exactly two points of Πq + 1 as vertices, and exactly one line of Πq + 1 as edge. We next use Lemma [\ref=lemPGn-1inPGn] to get the edge of C in Πq + 1 to be [formula]. Finally, we delete the edge [formula] from C and from the β-cycle Cq + 1. The union of the resulting paths is a cycle with the desired length.
