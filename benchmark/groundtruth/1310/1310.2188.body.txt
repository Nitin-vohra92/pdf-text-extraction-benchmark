Introduction

All graphs considered in this paper are finite, undirected and simple. Let G be a graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G). For a positive integer k, let [formula]. A (proper) k-coloring of G is a mapping f:V(G)  →  [k] such that f(x)  ≠  f(y) whenever xy∈E(G). The chromatic number of G, denoted by χ(G), is the smallest integer k such that G admits a k-coloring. We call the set f- 1(i) = {x∈V(G):f(x) = i} a color class for each i∈[k]. Notice that each color class in a proper coloring is an independent set, i.e., a subset of V(G) of pairwise non-adjacent vertices, and hence a k-coloring is a partition of V(G) into k independent sets. For a fixed positive integer r, an r-equitable k-coloring of G is a k-coloring for which any two color classes differ in size by at most r. A graph is r-equitably k-colorable if it has an r-equitable k-coloring. The r-equitable chromatic number of G, denoted by χr =(G), is the smallest integer k such that G is r-equitably k-colorable. For a graph G, the r-equitable chromatic threshold of G, denoted by χ*r =(G), is the smallest integer k such that G is r-equitably k'-colorable for all k'  ≥  k. Although the concept of r-equitable colorability seems a natural generalization of usual equitable colorability (corresponding to r=1) introduced by Meyer [\cite=meyer1973] in 1973, it was first proposed in a recent paper by Hertz and Ries [\cite=hertz2011], where the authors generalized the characterizations of usual equitable colorability of trees [\cite=chen1994] and forests [\cite=chang2009] to r-equitable colorability. Quite recently, Yen [\cite=yen2013] proposed a necessary and sufficient condition for a complete multipartite graph G to have an r-equitable k-coloring and also gave exact values of χr =(G) and χ*r =(G). In particular, they determined the value of χ*r =(Km(n)), where Km(n) denotes the complete m-partite graph with n vertices in each part.

[\cite=yen2013] For integers n,r  ≥  1 and m  ≥  2, we have [formula], where θ is the minimum positive integer such that [formula].

The special case of Lemma [\ref=balancer] for r = 1 was obtained by Lin and Chang [\cite=lin2010].

For two graphs G and H, the Kronecker product G  ×  H of G and H is the graph with vertex set {(x,y):  x∈V(G),y∈V(H)} and edge set {(x,y)(x',y'):xx'∈E(G) and yy'∈E(H)}. In this paper, we pay attention to the r-equitable colorability of Kronecker product of two complete graphs. We refer to [\cite=chen2009] [\cite=furmanczyk2006] [\cite=lin2010] [\cite=yan2013] for more studies on usual equitable colorability of Kronecker products of graphs.

In [\cite=duffus1985], Duffus et al. showed that if m  ≤  n then χ(Km  ×  Kn) = m. From this result, Chen [\cite=chen2009] got that χ=(Km  ×  Kn) = m for m  ≤  n. Indeed, let V(Km  ×  Kn) = {(xi,yj):  i∈[m],j∈[n]}. Then we can partition V(Km  ×  Kn) into m sets {(xi,yj):  j∈[n]} with [formula], all of which have equal size and are clearly independent. Similarly, for any r  ≥  1, χr =(Km  ×  Kn) = m for m  ≤  n. However, it is much more difficult to determine the exact value of χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn), even for r = 1.

[\cite=lin2010] For positive integers m  ≤  n, we have [formula].

In the same paper, Lin and Chang also determined χ*=(K2  ×  Kn) and χ*=(K3  ×  Kn). Note that the case when m = 1 is trivial since K1  ×  Kn is the empty graph In and hence χ*=(K1  ×  Kn) = 1. Recently, those results have been improved to the following.

[\cite=yan2014] For integers n  ≥  m  ≥  2, where s* is the minimum positive integer such that [formula] and [formula].

From the definition of s*, we see that s*  ≠  1 and hence s*  ≥  2. Let θ = s* - 1. Then we can restate Theorem [\ref=KmKnr1] as follows.

For integers n  ≥  m  ≥  2, where θ is the minimum positive integer such that [formula] and [formula].

If n  ≥  m and [formula] then χ*=(Km  ×  Kn) < χ*=(Km(n)).

Since Km  ×  Kn is a spanning subgraph of Km(n), χ*=(Km  ×  Kn)  ≤  χ*=(Km(n)). Therefore, the lemma follows if we can show χ*=(Km  ×  Kn)  ≠  χ*=(Km(n)). Let n = (m + 1)s + t with [formula] and 2  ≤  t  ≤  m - 1. We have [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=resKmKnr1], [formula] and hence m is not a factor of χ*=(Km  ×  Kn). On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=balancer], m is a factor of χ*=(Km(n)). Therefore, χ*=(Km  ×  Kn)  ≠  χ*=(Km(n)) and hence the proof is complete.

The main purpose of this paper is to obtain the exact value of χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn) for any r  ≥  1, which we state as the following theorem.

For any integers n  ≥  m  ≥  2 and r  ≥  1, where θ is the minimum positive integer such that [formula] and [formula].

Theorem [\ref=main] agrees with Theorem [\ref=resKmKnr1] when r = 1. Firstly, [formula]. Secondly, we claim that [formula] implies [formula]. Let n = (m + 1)s + t with [formula] and 2  ≤  t  ≤  m - 1. Then (m + 1)s < n < (m + 1)(s + 1) and hence

[formula]

Finally, we need to check that two definitions of θ in Theorems [\ref=resKmKnr1] and [\ref=main] are equivalent. Clearly, [formula] if and only if [formula]. Since [formula] is an integer and [formula], we have [formula]. As we have already shown [formula], we see that [formula]. This shows the two definitions of θ are equivalent.

For fixed integers m and r  ≥  2, Theorem [\ref=main] can be simplified when n is sufficiently large. Compared to Corollary [\ref=usu], the following theorem indicates that the behaviors of χ*r =(Km(n)) and χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn) with r  ≥  2 are quite different from the case when r = 1.

For any integers n  ≥  m  ≥  2 and r  ≥  2, if [formula] then χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn) = χ*r =(Km(n)), and moreover, Km  ×  Kn and Km(n) have the same r-equitable colorability, that is, Km  ×  Kn is r-equitably k-colorable if and only if Km(n) is r-equitably k-colorable.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=equ]

[\cite=yen2013] For any integer r  ≥  1, In has an r-equitable k-coloring with color classes of sizes between m and m + r if and only mk  ≤  n  ≤  (m + r)k.

Lemma [\ref=empty] is slightly different from Lemma 7 in [\cite=yen2013]. However, the original proof also applies in this statement.

[\cite=yen2013] For integers n,r  ≥  1 and k  ≥  m  ≥  2, Km(n) is r-equitably k-colorable if and only if [formula]

Let m,n and r be positive integers. (1) If [formula] then [formula]. (2) If [formula] then [formula]. (3) If [formula] then [formula].

Let n = (m + r)s + t with 0  ≤  t  ≤  m + r - 1. Clearly, [formula] and Therefore, (1) if 1  ≤  t  ≤  m - 1 then [formula], (2) if t = 0 or t = m then [formula], (3) if m + 1  ≤  t  ≤  m + r - 1 then [formula]. This proves the lemma.

The following lemma determines an upper bound for χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn), a generalization of Lemma [\ref=upperbound1].

For positive integers m  ≤  n and r, we have [formula].

Let [formula] and let k be any integer with k  ≥  Γ. We need to show that Km  ×  Kn is r-equitably k-colorable. Noting χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn)  ≤  χ*=(Km  ×  Kn) and [formula], Lemma [\ref=upperbound1] implies χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn)  ≤  n. Therefore, we may assume further k  ≤  n and hence Γ  ≤  k  ≤  n. Let V(Km  ×  Kn) = {(xi,yj):  i∈[m],j∈[n]} and n = (m + r)s + t, where [formula].

Case 1. [formula] i.e. 0  ≤  t  ≤  m.

By Lemma [\ref=inequ], [formula] and hence [formula]. Let Vj  =  {(xi,yj):  i∈[m]} for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - ms. By the definition of Kronecker products, each Vj is an independent set. Let n' = n - (k - ms). Since ms + t = Γ  ≤  k  ≤  n, we have ms  ≤  n'  ≤  n - t = (m + r)s. Let Ui  =  {(xi,yj):  k - ms + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n} for [formula]. Clearly each Ui is an independent set of size n'. By Lemma [\ref=empty], we can partition each Ui with [formula] into s independent sets of sizes between m and m + r. Combining [formula] with these ms independent sets gives an r-equitable k-coloring of Km  ×  Kn.

Case 2. [formula] i.e., m + 1  ≤  t  ≤  m + r - 1.

By Lemma [\ref=inequ], [formula] and hence m(s + 1)  ≤  k  ≤  n. Let Vj  =  {(xi,yj):  i∈[m]} for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - m(s + 1). Clearly, each Vj is an independent set of size m. Let n' = n - (k - m(s + 1)). Since m(s + 1)  ≤  k  ≤  n, we have m(s + 1)  ≤  n'  ≤  n = (m + r)s + t  ≤  (m + r)(s + 1). Let Ui  =  {(xi,yj):  k - m(s + 1) + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n} for [formula]. Clearly each Ui is an independent set of size n'. By Lemma [\ref=empty], we can partition each Ui with [formula] into s + 1 independent sets of sizes between m and m + r. Combining [formula] with these m(s + 1) independent sets gives an r-equitable k-coloring of Km  ×  Kn.

If m,n,r and θ are positive integers with m  ≥  2 and [formula], then Km(n) is not r-equitably [formula]-colorable for 1  ≤  i < m.

Let [formula]. If θ + r|n then [formula], yielding [formula], a contradiction to the assumption of this lemma. Hence [formula]. Now we have [formula] Consequently, [formula] and [formula]. Note that we may assume q - 1  ≠  0 since the lemma trivially follows when q = 1. Therefore, [formula] for 1  ≤  i < m. By Lemma [\ref=yendis], Km(n) is not r-equitably [formula]-colorable.

For positive integers m  ≥  2, s,θ,n and r, if Km(n) is not r-equitably k-colorable for some [formula], then there is a positive integer θ' such that [formula], [formula] and θ' < θ.

By Lemma [\ref=yendis], [formula]. Hence, [formula] for some nonnegative integer θ' and so

[formula]

If θ' = 0 then the first inequality of ([\ref=theta]) implies k > mn and hence Km(n) is clearly r-equitably k-colorable, a contradiction. Thus, θ' > 0. By ([\ref=theta]), we see [formula] and hence [formula]. Also from ([\ref=theta]), we have [formula] and [formula]. Finally, [formula] implying θ' < θ.

For positive integers m  ≥  2, s,θ,n and r, if Km  ×  Kn is r-equitably k-colorable for some [formula], then Km(n) is also r-equitably k-colorable.

Let V(Km  ×  Kn) = V(Km(n)) = {(xi,yj):  i∈[m],j∈[n]}. Let c be any r-equitable k-coloring of Km  ×  Kn with [formula]. It suffices to show that each color class of c is a subset of {(xi,yj):  j∈[n]} for some i∈[m]. Let [formula] denote the number of color classes, each of which is a subset of {(xi,yj):  i∈[m]} for some j∈[n]. Note that each independent set of V(Km  ×  Kn) is either a subset of {(xi,yj):  j∈[n]} for some i∈[m] or a subset of {(xi,yj):  i∈[m]} for some j∈[n]. Therefore, we only need to prove [formula]. Suppose to the contrary that [formula] and let [formula] be such color classes defined above. Since any two color classes of c differ in size by at most r and some color class, say U1, contains at most m vertices, each color class is of size at most m + r. For each i∈[m], let ki be the number of color classes contained in [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

Define [formula] for q  ≥  0. Since [formula], the minimum of {aq:  q  ≥  0} exists and is achieved by aq for some [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. Let n = (m + r)s + t with [formula]. Now, [formula]. We shall show either of the following two cases yields a contradiction.

Case 1. 0  ≤  t  ≤  m - 1.

We claim in this case that [formula] and hence k  ≥  ms + t. Clearly, at = ms + t. If 0  ≤  q  ≤  t - 1 then [formula]. If t + 1  ≤  q  ≤  m + r - 1 then t - q  ≥  0 - (m + r - 1) >  - (m + r) and hence [formula]. On the other hand, as shown in the proof of Lemma [\ref=inequ], we have [formula]. This is a contradiction to our assumption that [formula].

Case 2. m  ≤  t  ≤  m + r - 1.

We claim in this case that [formula] and hence k  ≥  m(s + 1). Clearly, [formula] If 1  ≤  q  ≤  t - 1 then [formula]. If t  ≤  q  ≤  m + r - 1 then [formula] Similarly, as shown in the proof of Lemma [\ref=inequ], we have [formula], a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. Denote [formula] We divide the proof into two cases.

Case 1. [formula] and [formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=upperboundr] and [\ref=inequ], [formula]. Let [formula]. We need to show that Km  ×  Kn is not r-equitably k-colorable. Noting k < Γ, it suffices to show that Km(n) is not r-equitably k-colorable by Lemma [\ref=mulkro].

By the first condition of this case, let n = (m + r)s + t with 2  ≤  t  ≤  m - 1. We have [formula] and hence ms < k < m(s + 1). Consequently, [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], we have [formula] from the last condition of this case. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=yendis], Km(n) is not r-equitably k-colorable. This completes the proof of this case.

Case 2. [formula], or [formula] and [formula]

Since [formula], by Lemma [\ref=minusi], Km(n) is not r-equitably [formula]-colorable. Since [formula], by Lemma [\ref=mulkro], Km  ×  Kn is not r-equitably [formula]-colorable. In the following, we prove that Km  ×  Kn is r-equitably k-colorable for all [formula], which implies [formula].

Suppose to the contrary that Km  ×  Kn (and hence Km(n)) is not r-equitably k-colorable for some [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=upperboundr], k < Γ. By Lemma [\ref=thetaprime], there is a positive integer θ' such that [formula], [formula] and θ' < θ. By the minimality of θ, [formula].

Let n = (m + r)s + t with 0  ≤  t  ≤  m + r - 1. We show each of the following three subcases yields a contradiction.

Subcase 2.1. [formula], i.e., t = 0,1.

By Lemma [\ref=inequ], [formula]. Since k < Γ we see k < ms + t  ≤  ms + 1, and hence k  ≤  ms. Therefore, [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Subcase 2.2. [formula], i.e., [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=inequ], [formula]. Hence k < m(s + 1) and [formula]. This is a contradiction.

Subcase 2.3. [formula] and [formula]

By Lemma [\ref=inequ], [formula]. If k  ≤  ms then [formula], a contradiction. Now assume k > ms. Since k < Γ = ms + t, we have ms < k < ms + t < m(s + 1), yielding [formula] and [formula]. Consequently, by the second condition of this subcase, [formula] Therefore, Km(n) is r-equitably k-colorable. This is a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=equ]. Comparing Theorem [\ref=main] with Lemma [\ref=balancer], it suffices to show, for the first part, that under the assumption of this theorem, the following two statements hold: () [formula], () if [formula] then [formula].

By the assumption that [formula], we have [formula], yielding

[formula]

Multiplying the first and last term of the inequality by [formula] gives

[formula]

Dividing by [formula] leads to [formula]. Hence, [formula], which implies ().

Now we assume further [formula] and show [formula]. If [formula] then [formula], a contradiction. Hence [formula] Multiplying by (θ + 1)(θ + r) gives (θ + 1)(θ + r) > (r - 1)n  ≥  (m + r)(m + 2r - 1), implying θ > m + r - 1. Hence [formula]. It remains to show [formula]. Since θ > m + r - 1 and [formula], we have

[formula]

as desired.

Since Km  ×  Kn is a spanning subgraph of Km(n), Km(n) has an r-equitable k-coloring only if Km  ×  Kn has an r-equitable k-coloring. Suppose that Km  ×  Kn is r-equitably k-colorable for some integer k. If k  ≥  χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn) then k  ≥  χ*r =(Km(n)), since χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn) = χ*r =(Km(n)), and hence Km(n) is r-equitably k-colorable. If k < χ*r =(Km  ×  Kn), then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=upperboundr]. Therefore, Lemma [\ref=mulkro] implies that Km(n) is r-equitably k-colorable. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=equ].
