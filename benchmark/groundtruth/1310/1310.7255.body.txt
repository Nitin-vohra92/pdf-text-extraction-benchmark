On groups with locally compact asymptotic cones

Let G be a group generated by a finite set X. Then G can be considered as a metric space where [formula] is the length of a shortest word on [formula] representing g- 1h. Let ω be a non-principal ultrafilter on [formula], i.e. a function from the set of subsets [formula] to {0,1} with [formula] if [formula], [formula] and ω(A) = 0 for every finite set A.

Note that if [formula], then [formula] because [formula] is a disjoint union of A and [formula]. For every [formula], we have ω(A)  ≤  ω(B) because B is a disjoint union of [formula] and A. For every two subsets [formula], [formula] because [formula] is a disjoint union of [formula] and B. Also if ω(A) = ω(B) = 1, then [formula] because [formula]. For every property P of natural numbers, we say that P is true ω-almost surely if the set S of numbers with property P satisfies ω(S) = 1. Thus is ω-almost surely every natural number satisfies P and ω-almost surely every natural number satisfies Q, then ω-almost surely every natural number satisfies P and Q. We are going to use this property of ultrafilters several times later without reference.

For every sequence of real numbers ri  ≥  0 one can define the limit lim ωri as the (unique) number [formula] such that for every ε we have |ri - r| < ε ω-almost surely for all [formula] (see [\cite=D]).

Choose a sequence of scaling constants dn > 0 such that lim ωdn  =    ∞   and define a pseudo-metric [formula] on the Cartesian power [formula] as

[formula]

Let [formula] be the connected component of the sequence [formula]. Thus [formula] consists of all the elements from [formula] at finite distance from [formula]. Let ~   be the equivalence relation (ui)  ~  (vi) if and only if [formula]. Then [formula] induces a metric [formula] on [formula], and [formula] with this metric is called the asymptotic cone of G corresponding to the ultrafilter ω and the sequence of scaling constants (dn), denoted [formula] (for more details see [\cite=D] [\cite=DS] [\cite=SBMS]). Elements of [formula] corresponding to sequences [formula] will be denoted by (yi)ω. Note that [formula] is a group which acts on [formula] transitively by isometries: (gi)  ·  (ui)ω = (giui)ω (see [\cite=D] [\cite=SBMS]).

Asymptotic cones were first explicitly used by van den Dries and Wilkie [\cite=DW] to prove the celebrated theorem of Gromov [\cite=G1] that every finitely generated group of polynomial growth is virtually nilpotent (for more applications see [\cite=G2] [\cite=D] [\cite=DS] [\cite=SBMS]). One can easily deduce from [\cite=DW] that if all asymptotic cones of a finitely generated group are proper (i.e. all closed balls are compact), then G has polynomial growth and hence is virtually nilpotent.

A finitely generated group can have several non-homeomorphic asymptotic cones [\cite=TV]. In fact there are finitely generated groups with continuum non-π1-equivalent asymptotic cones [\cite=DS]. On the other hand, every virtually nilpotent finitely generated group has only one asymptotic cone up to isometry by Pansu [\cite=Pan]. In [\cite=DW], van den Dries and Wilkie asked whether local compactness of just one asymptotic cone of G implies that G is virtually nilpotent.

F. Point proved [\cite=P] that if one asymptotic cone of G is locally compact and has finite Minkovsky dimension, then G is virtually nilpotent.

Here we will show how to use a recent result of Hrushovsky [\cite=H] to answer the question of van den Dries and Wilkie affirmatively. To formulate Hrushovsky's result we need the notion of an approximable subgroup.

Let G be a finitely generated group, k∈N. Assume that G has a collection [formula] of k-approximate subgroups such that any finite subset F  ⊂  G is contained in a one of the Fi. Then G is virtually nilpotent.

If one asymptotic cone of a finitely generated group G contains a compact closed ball of positive radius, then G is virtually nilpotent.

Suppose that a closed ball of radius ε > 0 in [formula] is compact. Since C admits a transitive group of isometries, we can assume that this is the ball BC(ε,) of radius ε around [formula]. Since BC(ε,) is compact, it is contained in the union of a finite number of balls [formula], [formula], [formula]. Let xi = (gi,j)ω, [formula], [formula]. Note that by the definition of asymptotic cone, for every [formula], [formula] ω-almost surely (since [formula]).

For every [formula] let 2pj be the smallest even natural number which is greater than εdj. Then |2pj  -  εdj| < 2 for every j, whence lim ωpj  =    ∞  .

For every [formula] and [formula] consider the balls BG(2pj,1) and BG(pj,gi,j) = gi,jBG(pj,1) in G (viewed as a metric space).

We claim that ω-almost surely for every j, the ball BG(2pj,1) is covered by the balls BG(pj,gi,j), [formula]. Indeed, let S be the set of natural numbers j for which this is true. Suppose that ω(S) = 0. Then [formula]. For each [formula] let yj be a point in BG(2pj,1) which does not belong to any of the balls BG(pj,gi,j). Consider any sequence [formula] such that zj = yj for all [formula]. Since [formula], z = (zi)ω is at distance at least [formula] from (gi,j)ω = xi, [formula]. Therefore z does not belong to any of the balls [formula]. Hence z does not belong to BC(ε,). But [formula], a contradiction.

Thus ω-almost surely for every j, the ball BG(2pj,1) is contained in the union

[formula]

But BG(2pj,1) is equal to the product BG(pj,1)BG(pj,1) in G. Hence BG(pj,1) is a k-approximable subgroup of G ω-almost surely for every j. Since G is finitely generated and lim ωpj  =    ∞  , every finite subset of G is contained in one of the balls BG(pj,1), so it remains to apply Theorem [\ref=t:71].
