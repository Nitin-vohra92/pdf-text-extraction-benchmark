Reply to the reply to "Comment on Universal out-of-equilibrium transport in Kondo-correlated quantum dots"

Two recent works attempt to extend results for the conductance through a quantum dot described by the particle-hole symmetric (PHS) impurity Anderson model out of the PHS case using renormalized perturbation theory in U (PTU) [\cite=sca] [\cite=mu]. A controversy between the authors of these papers exists [\cite=com] [\cite=reply]. First Muñoz et al. added an incorrect note in arXiv:1111.4076 criticizing Ref. [\cite=sca] (arXiv:1110.0816) before it was published. These points were clarified in Ref. [\cite=com], but a criticism of Muñoz et al. regarding Ward identities (addressed below) persists [\cite=reply].

On the other hand, my main criticism [\cite=com] is that lesser and greater quantities in Ref. [\cite=mu] are incorrect even in the PHS case. This includes the expressions for the lesser self energy and Green function, relating them with the retarded ones Σ<MBK(ω) = 2ifeff(ω)Im

[formula]

, where feff(ω) is the average of the Fermi function at the two leads, weighted by the corresponding Γν. The hybridization term, leading to the broadening iΔ can be included either in the non interacting Hamiltonian or in the perturbation. Clearly, the first (simpler) approach was followed [\cite=mu]. The retarded quantities are right in the PHS case, but the lesser quantities are not, as can be checked comparing with earlier work on PTU [\cite=her].

As explained in Ref. [\cite=com], out of the PHS case, if one uses incorrect lesser and greater quantities, conservation of the current is not guaranteed, and even retarded quantities might be wrong. The rapid deterioration of the agreement with numerical-renormalization-group (NRG) results at equilibrium as the system is moved away from PHS is suggestive [\cite=merker].

The arguments in Ref. [\cite=reply] regarding an alleged failure of Ward identities in the analytical expression for Σ<(ω) given by Eq. (20) of Ref. [\cite=sca] is flawed because the authors assumed that ∂Σ<  /  ∂V is an analytic function, which is not true at T = 0. To keep the argument simple, let us consider symmetric voltage drops and couplings to the leads (this implies γ = 0 in the notation of Ref. [\cite=sca] which I use here). In this case, Eq. (20) of Ref. [\cite=sca] coincides with Eq. (87) of Ref. [\cite=her] at T = 0. Trivial derivation leads to

[formula]

Obviously, for V=0, ∂Σ<  /  ∂V vanishes identically, as required by the Ward identity ∂Σ<  /  ∂eV  =    -  γ(∂Σ<  /  ∂ω  +  ∂Σ<  /  ∂Ed) [\cite=ogu]. This identity is valid only for V = 0 since the arguments used to relate the different derivatives require that the Fermi levels of both leads coincide. Due to the non analyticity of the step functions θ(ω), even a tiny V leads to a term proportional to ω for ω  →  0 in Eq. ([\ref=dsl]). This term is quite right. This points that it is at least dangerous to use Ward identities for an expansion of the self energies around T = 0 as done in Ref. [\cite=mu].

For the general asymmetric case, derivation of Eq. (20) of Ref. [\cite=sca] and evaluation at V = 0 leads to (up to terms linear in ω) [\cite=note]

[formula]

Since ∂Σ<  /  ∂Ed is of higher order, this also agrees with the Ward identity. More details and extension to finite temperature are in Ref. [\cite=ng].

If [formula] and [formula] are determined from either susceptibility and specific heat, NRG or Bethe ansatz, there is no problem with overcounting. Terms of higher order in [formula] lead to terms of higher order in ω and V.
