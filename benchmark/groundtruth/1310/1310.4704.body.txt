Introduction

In [\cite=mehtapaulysemistabledirectimage] Mehta and Pauly asked whether for a smooth projective curve over a field of characteristic p  >  0 and E a semistable bundle on X the length of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of [formula] is at most p. In [\cite=zhoucounterexampleshnflength] this is answered negatively. Examples are constructed based on a result of Sun ([\cite=sunfrobdirectimage]). The bundles for which examples are obtained in [\cite=zhoucounterexampleshnflength] have rank ≥  2p (in fact, examples are constructed for any np with n  ≥  2) and are over curves of large genus since restriction theorems and Bertini are used. The purpose of this short note is to provide surprisingly simple down to earth examples in characteristic p for certain smooth plane curves and bundles of rank [formula]. In characteristic 2 negative examples exist on any smooth projective curve of genus ≥  2. We note that our examples are only polystable, while one should be able to obtain stable bundles using the methods outlined in [\cite=zhoucounterexampleshnflength].

The example

Clearly S is semistable. We have μ(Gi)  =  2μ  -  μ(Li) which implies μ(Gi)  <  μ(Gi + 1) for all i. We also have μ(Li)  >  μ(Gj) for all i,j. Indeed, we may assume that i  >  j then μ(Li)  -  μ(Gj)  =  μ(Lj)  -  μ(Gi) and by assumption μ(Li)  >  μ(Lj)  >  μ(Gj). Hence, μ(Lj)  >  μ(Gi).

It follows that the slopes of the quotients Qi of the filtration form a strictly decreasing sequence. As all Qi are semistable as line bundles this is the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of [formula].

Assume to the contrary that E is unstable and let N denote the maximal destablizing subbundle E. The maximal destabilising subbundle of [formula] is [formula]. Since the Harder-Narasimhan filtration is unique and in the rank 2 case automatically strong we must have [formula]. Hence, [formula] for some p-torsion bundle T.

Consider now the natural inclusion [formula] and the projection p:E  →  M. The Frobenius pull-back of the composition [formula] is the identity. In particular [formula] is non-zero. Since both line bundles are of the same degree this map is an isomorphism. Hence, if E is not semistable then the sequence has to split which contradicts the assumption c  ≠  0.
