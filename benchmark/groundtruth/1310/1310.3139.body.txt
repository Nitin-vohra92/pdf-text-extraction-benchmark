Inclusive J  /  ψ  production in p-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC

Introduction

Production of charmonia, bound state of c and [formula] quarks, is an intense research activity, both experimentally and theoretically. The peculiar properties of some of the charmonium states, like their small size (<  1 fm) and strong binding energy (several hundred MeV), make them ideal probes of the strongly interacting deconfined matter, the so-called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [\cite=ALICE] was designed to study heavy-ion collisions and the properties of the QGP. One of the signatures of the QGP formation is the so-called J  /  ψ  "melting" [\cite=matsui] that results in a suppression of the J  /  ψ  in heavy-ion collisions. The J  /  ψ  suppression can be quantified in terms of the nuclear modification factor:

[formula]

where YAA is the invariant yield of the J  /  ψ  measured in nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions, TAA is the nuclear thickness function, σJ / ψpp is the J  /  ψ  cross-section in pp collisions at the same energy. If RAA differs from unity nucleus-nucleus collisions cannot be considered as a simple superposition of elementary nucleon-nucleon collisions. ALICE measured RAA  =  0.545  ±  0.032(stat.)  ±  0.083(syst.) in Pb-Pb collisions at [formula] = 2.76 TeV [\cite=alicepbpb]. The J  /  ψ  suppression observed in this measurement was well described in terms of hot nuclear matter effects (related to QGP formation). However other effects, related to cold nuclear matter (CNM) are expected to play a role. They can be divided into three main groups:

Initial state effects. Gluon shadowing [\cite=shad] (or gluon saturation [\cite=satur]) is an effect of depletion of low-momentum gluons in nuclei compared to protons. It is currently poorly constrained by data at LHC energy.

Nuclear absorption. A J  /  ψ , or a pre-resonant c pair can be dissociated by interacting with cold nuclear matter [\cite=absorp]. At the LHC, due to the large Lorentz boost of the colliding nuclei at mid­‐ and forward rapidity in p-­Pb collisions the c pair spends a very short time within cold nuclear matter. Therefore such effect (also known as nuclear absorption) is expected to be negligible.

Coherent parton energy loss [\cite=arleo]. It is related to the medium-induced radiative loss by the initial (partons) or final (c pair) state.

To investigate the role of CNM effects and disentangle them from the hot nuclear matter effects in Pb-Pb collisions, p-Pb collisions were studied at the LHC at [formula]  = 5.02 TeV in 2013. First results are already submitted for publication [\cite=aliceppb].

Analysis

The ALICE detector allows to study the J  /  ψ  production down to zero transverse momentum in two decay channels: dimuon at forward and dielectron at mid-rapidity. In this work we will concentrate on the dimuon channel, studied in the muon spectrometer [\cite=ALICE] with an acceptance - 4  <  ylab  <   - 2.5. Due to the LHC beam energy asymmetry the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass system is shifted by Δy  =  0.465 in the direction of the proton beam with respect to the laboratory system. Two configurations were adopted, obtained by inverting the direction of the two beams in the machine. The measurements of the J  /  ψ  production in ALICE were then performed in two different rapidity ranges: backward (- 4.46  <  ycms  <   - 2.96) and forward (2.03  <  ycms  <  3.53) with an integrated luminosities of 5.81 ±   0.19 nb- 1 and 5.03 ±   0.18 nb- 1, respectively. This analysis is based on the dimuon trigger selection, requiring a coincidence of minimum bias (MB) interaction with two opposite sign muon tracks detected in the trigger chambers of the muon spectrometer. The MB trigger efficiency for non-single-diffractive events is > 99% [\cite=MBtrigger]. The dimuon trigger efficiency reaches 96% for [formula]1.5 GeV/c. To reject single muons at the edge of the acceptance of spectrometer the condition of - 4 < ημ <  - 2.5 was required.

The raw J  /  ψ  yield was extracted by fitting the opposite-sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum by the sum of a background and a signal function. The numbers of J  /  ψ  and its systematic uncertainty were evaluated from different fits varying background, signal ([\cite=crystalball] [\cite=NA60]) functions and the fitting range. The acceptance times efficiency (A  ×  ε) was estimated using a pure J  /  ψ  signal Monte-Carlo simulation tuned on the real data kinematic distributions. The integrated values of A  ×  ε are (17.1  ±  1.2)% and (25.4  ±  1.3)% for the backward and forward rapidity regions, respectively. The difference in the values results from different tracking efficiency in the two periods of data taking. In order to study the nuclear effects on the J  /  ψ  production in p-Pb collisions, the nuclear modification factor RpPb defined as ([\ref=eq:RAA]) was used. Given the fact that there are no measurements of σJ / ψpp at [formula] 5.02 TeV, an interpolation procedure was followed, based on the following steps:

Energy interpolation: existing ALICE pp results at [formula] and 7 TeV (covering 2.5  <  y  <  4.0 in six bins) were interpolated with empirical shapes (linear, power law and exponential).

Rapidity interpolation/extrapolation: due to the y-shift in p-Pb, the results from the previous step were fitted with empirical shapes (gaussian, polynomial) to reach the desired y-coverage.

The results of the procedure were validated by comparison with theoretical models: CEM [\cite=CEM] and actual FONLL calculation for c production [\cite=FONLL]. The values for σJ / ψpp scaled by the Pb-nucleus mass number are shown in the left panel of Fig.[\ref=sigma] by a blue band representing the uncertainties estimated by this procedure.

In addition to RpPb the forward-to-backward ratio RFB, defined as:

[formula]

and independent on the pp reference cross section, was also studied.

RFB was measured in a narrower rapidity range (2.96  <  |ycms|  <  3.53) than RpPb. The advantages of RFB are that nuclear thickness function and σJ / ψpp cancel out in the ratio and therefore, a pp interpolation is not needed. However the overall statistics was reduced by 30%.

Results

The measured J  /  ψ  cross-sections in p-Pb collisions at [formula]  = 5.02 TeV for the full statistics are shown in Fig.[\ref=sigma] differentially in y (left panel) and in [formula] (right panel). In the backward region the J  /  ψ  production is larger, and softer in [formula]. The nuclear modification factors RpPb integrated over [formula] for the forward and backward rapidity ranges are:

RpPb (2.03 < ycms < 3.53) = 0.70  ±  0.01stat.  ±  0.04syst.uncorr.  ±  0.03syst.part.corr.  ±  0.03syst.corr.

RpPb (- ­‐4.46 < ycms <  - ­‐2.96)=1.08  ±  0.01stat.  ±  0.08syst.uncorr.  ±  0.07syst.part.corr.  ±  0.04syst.corr.

The uncertainty is dominated by the pp interpolation and the tracking efficiency. In Fig.[\ref=RpA] the rapidity dependence of RpPb is presented. In the forward rapidity region the Color Glass Condensate (CGC)-based model underestimates the data while predictions of models including parton energy loss and/or shadowing are in fair agreement with the data.

An integrated value of RFB  =  0.60  ±  0.01(stat.)  ±  0.06(syst.) was measured. In Fig.[\ref=RFB] the results on RFB are shown as a function of rapidity (left) and pT (right). The uncertainty on RFB is dominated by the tracking efficiency. A model which includes shadowing as the only CNM effect slightly overestimates the data integrated over [formula], while the inclusion of an energy loss component leads to a better agreement. A sizeable pT dependence of RFB with a stronger suppression at low pT is measured. Theoretical models including energy loss and shadowing show strong nuclear matter effects at low pT in fair agreement with the data.

Conclusions

Inclusive J  /  ψ  suppression was measured by ALICE in p-Pb collisions at [formula]  = 5.02 TeV. The RFB (RpPb) were measured vs y and [formula] (vs y) and compared with theoretical models. Within uncertainties, both the shadowing and the coherent energy loss approaches give a fair description of the data, while the CGC-inspired model underestimates the data.
