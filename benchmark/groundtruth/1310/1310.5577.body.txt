On cross-section computation in the brane-world models

Introduction

There are a lot of softwares for simulating a "New physics" processes at the accelerating experiments. Such programs as CompHep [\cite=Boos:2009un] and PYTHIA [\cite=Sjostrand:2000wi] are among them. Nevertheless, one can consider an infinite extra spatial dimension in the brane-world models. CompHep and PYTHIA are not adopted for such class of models. In this paper we present the numerical simulations of the processes pp  →   + EmissT on Mathematica7 in the backgound of modified Randall-Sundrum brane model with one infinite and n compact extra dimensions (RSII-n model). In this brane world model neutral particle such as Z boson and photon can leave our brane, escaping in to the extra dimension of infinite size. In our sumulation we use Gluck Reya Vogt leading order parton distribution functions. In Sec. [\ref=Motiv] we compare LO Gluck Reya Vogt PDF [\cite=Gluck:1998xa], by with CTEQ [\cite=Pumplin:2002vw], MRST [\cite=Martin:2002dr] and Alekhin's [\cite=Alekhin:2002fv] LO PDFs. This PDFs coincide at large QCD scale parameter squared Q2. In Sec. [\ref=Comparison] we compare CompHep and Mathematica7 numerical simulations of the process pp  →   + Z0 in the framework of standard model. We discuss RSII-n set up in Sec. [\ref=RSsetup]. In Sec. [\ref=EnergyMissing] we present numerical simulations of the process pp  →   + EmissT in the framework of RSII-n model.

Comparison of PDFs at large Q2.

In this section we compare LO Gluck Reya Vogt parton distribution functions with CTEQ, MRST and Alekhin's PDFs. Corresponding distributions for u and ū quarks are presented on Fig. [\ref=figureA]. We suppose that QCD scale parameter is fixed at Q = 100 GeV. These data are taken from an open High energy physics database [\cite=hep]. We can see from Fig. [\ref=figureA] that GRV LO PDFs coincide with CTEQ LO, MRST LO and Alekhin's LO PDFs at large Q2. One can obtain an analogous distribution for d, [formula] quarks and gluon. This means that in the numerical analysis we can use GRV LO PDFs as well as CTEQ, MRST and Alekhins PDFs if Q2 is fixed at large values.

CompHep vs Mathematica7 in the SM framework.

In this section we compare CompHep and Mathematica7 numerical simulations for the parton cross-sections in the framework of standard model. In Fig. [\ref=figureB] we show the differential cross-section of the processes dg  →  Z0d and ug  →  Z0u versus transverse momentum of Z0 boson. The QCD scale is fixed at Q = 1000 GeV. The diagrams for GRV and CTEQ LO PDFs are coincided. But there is a small discreapancy in xu(x,Q2) distribution at high pT values. The analogous distribution can be obtained for the other SM processes such as g  →  Z0, ūg  →  Z0ū, d  →  Z0g and ūd  →  Z0g. Nevertheless, the main contribution to the process pp  →   + Z0 comes from the gluon cross-sections which are shown on Fig. [\ref=figureB].

Modified Randall-Sundrum model

In this section we discuss a peculiar features of the modified RSII-n model. Let us consider a 3-brane with n compact dimensions embeeded in a (5 + n) space-time AdS metric

[formula]

This metric was suggested by T. Gherghetta and M. Shaposhnikov [\cite=Gherghetta:2000qi]. Here z is the infinite extra dimension, θi are the compact extra-dimensions θi∈[0,2πRi], [formula], Ri are the sizes of compact extra dimensions, n - is the number of compact extra dimensions, a(z) = e- k|z| is a warp factor from Randall-Sundrum model and k is a AdS curvature.

We put entire SU(2)  ×  U(1) gauge sector, as well as the Higgs sector into the bulk space, but the fermions of the standard modell are supposed to be localized on the brane. The action of the model is

[formula]

Γ(M)≤ ΔΓ=1.5  MeV.

Numerical simulation of the process pp  →   + EmissT.

In this section we discuss numerical simulation of the process pp  →   + Zbulk(γbulk) at the collider experiment in the frame work of RSII-n model. Here the jet originates from gluon or quark, and Zbulk and γbulk are the particles which escape the brane. The differential cross-section of this process is

[formula]

where Mij  →  k(bulk) are parton amplitudes for the subprocesses gq  →  qZbulk(γbulk), q  →  gZbulk(γbulk) (see Ref. [\cite=Kirpichnikov:2012vb] for details); m is a bulk invariant mass of Zbulk and γbulk:

[formula]

and fi(x1,Q2) are GRV LO PDFs [\cite=Gluck:1998xa]. The QCD scale parameter is fixed at Q = 1 TeV. We compare the distribution ([\ref=DiffCrSect]) with the standard model background pp  →    +  ν. This background was computed by CompHep program [\cite=Boos:2009un].

Let us consider the case of the proton center-of-mass energy equal 14 TeV. In Fig. [\ref=figure1] we show pT and jet rapidity distributions of the process pp  →   + Zbulk(γbulk). One can see from Fig. [\ref=figure1] that if n = 6 and n = 5, then the signal dominates over the background for pT  >  500 GeV and pT  >  750 GeV, correspondingly. And the background dominates over the signal for n = 3,4. Once the larger values of k correspond to the smaller n (see Tab. [\ref=table1]), so that the signal cross section grows with the increase of n. It is clear from Fig. [\ref=figure1] that the jet rapidity distributions are correlated with the jet transverse momentum distributions. In Tab. [\ref=table2] we show the integrated luminosity and number of signal events needed for 5σ discovery at the LHC center-of-mass energy equal 14 TeV. Where the cuts in jet rapidity and transverse momentum are |y| < 2, pT  >  900 GeV.

Now let us consider the case [formula] TeV. In Fig. [\ref=figure7] we show the jet transverse momentum and rapidity distributions. Only the case with n  ≥  6 can be probed, since the background dominates over the signal for n = 3,4,5. The integrated luminosity required for 5σ discovery at the LHC is L = 200  - 1 even for n = 6.

Summary

In the framework of RSII-n model the distributions of the process pp  →    +  Z0bulk(γbulk) were simulated on Mathematica7 with GRV LO PDFs implemented. The detection of the extra spatial dimension at 7 TeV appears to be hopeless. At the LHC energy equal 14 TeV the luminosity needed for 5σ discovery is in the range (10 - 100)- 1.
