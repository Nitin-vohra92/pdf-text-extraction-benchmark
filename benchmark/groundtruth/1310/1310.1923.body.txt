Introduction

Star forming galaxies at redshift z  ≈  1 - 2 have high gas fractions [formula]50%, probed by both their molecular gas and dust properties ([\citealt=daddi10_gasfrac] [\citealt=magdis12] [\citealt=tacconi13], but note criticism from [\citealt=narayanan12]). Many galaxy evolution models under-predict gas fractions at high redshifts [\citep=dutton10] [\citep=dave12], and cosmological simulations find gas fractions as low as 10% at z  ≈  1 - 2 for stellar masses in the 1010 - 1011 M[formula] range (e.g. [\citealt=ceverino10] [\citealt=keres12], but higher in some cases, e.g. [\citealt=genel12]). This likely results from a too-rapid consumption of gas reservoirs at z  >  2, where observations suggest that the efficiency of star formation is more moderate [\citep=daddi07] [\citep=gonzalez10] [\citep=elbaz11] [\citep=bouwens12] [\citep=reddy12] [\citep=stark13]. The need to delay star formation in the z > 2 progenitors of star-forming galaxies, summarized by [\citet=bouche10] and [\citet=weinmann12], may [\citep=henriques13] or may not be solved by stellar feedback - recently simulated galaxies with stronger feedback still become star-dominated within their effective radii by z  ≈  3, with excessive specific star formation rates at earlier epochs [\citep=ceverino13]. Feedback from active galactic nuclei tends to exacerbate the problem by lowering gas fractions [\citep=dubois12_dual] if it has a substantial effect at all [\citep=gabor13_bh_growth]. Low metallicity could play a role by hindering cooling [\citep=krumholz12_metal]. Here we examine another possibility to maintain high gas fractions: infalling gas streams could themselves delay star-formation.

Cosmological simulations indicate that galaxies are predominantly fed by relatively diffuse gas flowing along dark matter filaments, rather than mergers [\citep=keres05] [\citep=ocvirk08] [\citep=brooks09]. If the kinetic energy from the infalling gas couples with the galactic disk, this may increase the turbulent velocity dispersion at early times [\citep=elmegreen10] [\citep=genel12_analytic], until grown-up galaxies at lower redshift manage to self-regulate their gas turbulence. We propose that this boosted velocity dispersion will tend to increase the physical size of the galaxy gas distribution, lowering the gas density and star formation efficiency. As we will show, the overall SF effiency can be reduced by factors of about three at z  ≥  3, making it possible to maintain high gas fractions of 40-50% down to z  ≈  2 - 3. We study this process with an analytic model (§[\ref=sec.model]) that combines the "bath tub" approach for galaxy evolution [\citep=bouche10] [\citep=dave12] [\citep=lilly13] with analytic descriptions of star formation in turbulent gas [\citep=elmegreen02] [\citep=krumholz07] and accounts for the external energy supply. We also simulate the hydrodynamic interaction of galaxies with infalling gas streams (§[\ref=sec.sims]) and confirm that rapid gas infall feeds only reduced and delayed star formation in z  ≈  3 - 6 conditions.

Analytic model

We develop an analytic model for galaxy evolution that combines three main physical elements: an estimate of self-regulated vs. infall-driven gas turbulence, a star-formation rate linked to the gas density and velocity dispersion, and a standard "bath-tub"-like mass budget.

(i) Self-regulated vs. infall-driven gas turbulence: We use an approach similar to [\citet=elmegreen10] to determine the gas velocity dispersion. Internal processes in galaxies that generate turbulence (e.g. gravitational instabilities, radial flows, star formation feedback) all saturate about the limit for gravitational instability, which corresponds to a Toomre parameter Q = 0.7 for thick disks [\citep=dekel09]. These processes, regardless of their respective individual contribution, stir the gas disk at a minimal level [formula] below which the gas velocity dispersion cannot drop (in a steady state). Σgas is the gas surface density, and Ω  =  vrot / r is the orbital frequency of the disk.

The next question is whether external gas infall alone can stir the disk above this internally-determined level. Because internal processes saturate at σ min, a contribution from external sources lower than σ min will not add turbulence - it will only decrease the relative contribution of internal sources in the σ min. External infall at a mass rate [formula] injects kinetic energy at a rate [formula], where [formula], Mh is the halo mass, and H(z) is the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter [\citep=croton06]. Ainfall specifies the coupling efficiency of infall energy to the turbulent energy of the disk. For simplicity we assume that Ainfall  =   (disk surface area)/  (stream cross-sectional area), with a maximum value of 1. We address the disk radius and thus the disk area below. We assume the typical cosmic stream radius to be fstream = 0.1 times the virial radius of the characteristic Press-Schecter halo [\citep=dekel06]. This typically gives Ainfall = 1 at [formula] for the galaxies we study here, which is supported by our simulations in §[\ref=sec.sims]. The other key behavior of this coupling is that it becomes weak around z = 2, as required to prevent low-z disks from being too thick [\citep=genel12_analytic]. We discuss the coupling further at the end of §[\ref=sec.results].

While inflows add turbulent energy, dissipation of that energy occurs over fdiss  ≈  3 disk dynamical times [\citep=maclow98] [\citep=gammie01], so that [formula], where vrot is the galaxy rotation velocity, and Rgal is the radius. With the equations we track the turbulent energy in the gas, Eturb, and the velocity dispersion achievable from infall [formula]. Because of the previously mentioned saturation effects, we assume that the gas settles at a velocity dispersion equal to max (σ min,σinfall).

(ii) The star formation rate is determined based not just on the gas density, but also on its velocity dispersion. We assume the gas takes on a log-normal density probability distribution function (PDF) typical of supersonic turbulence [\citep=padoan97], independent of the main source of turbulence. The peak of the log-normal is determined from the average gas density of the galaxy (see below) and the width of the PDF is ( ln (1 + 0.75(σ / cs)2))(1 / 2), where the sound speed cs is assumed to be ≈  10km s- 1 for the star-forming gas [\citep=padoan97] We assume that gas at number densities above 100 cm- 3 forms stars at a volumetric rate of [formula], where tff is the free-fall time and ε* = 0.01 is the local star-formation efficiency per free-fall time [\citep=krumholz12_sflaw]. Numerical integration over the density PDF and galaxy volume gives the total SFR of the galaxy.

Determining the average gas density requires an estimate of the galaxy geometry. The disk radius depends on the galaxy's angular momentum, which is highly uncertain for high-z galaxies. For simplicity and consistency with previous work, we follow [\citet=krumholz12_metal] to obtain the standard, undisturbed disk scale radius of Rscale  =  0.5λRv, where λ is the halo spin parameter and Rv is the halo virial radius. We use λ = 0.07 as a typical value [\citep=dutton11]. This radius is increased when infalling gas increases the velocity dispersion and scatters gas to larger radii. We can estimate this effect by taking v2rotation  ≈  v2circ  -  3σ2 for the rotational specific energy, then assuming angular momentum is approximately conserved with Rscalevcirc  ≈  Rdisturbedvrotation. Here vcirc is the circular velocity and vrotation is the actual rotational velocity. The disk scale radius becomes Rdisturbed  ≈  Rscale(1.0  -  3σ2  /  v2circ)( - 1 / 2). For simplicity, we multiply this scale radius by 1.7 to obtain the total disk radius, as appropriate for exponential disks. The scale height of the gas disk is given by H  =  σ2  /  (πGΣs + g), where Σs + g is the total mass surface density of stars and gas in the disk. Thus, when inflowing gas streams increase σ, both the radius and scale height increase. The average gas density decreases because the rapidly infalling gas does not immediately settle into a thin, self-gravitating disk.

(iii) "Bath tub"-like mass budget: Cosmological inflow acts as a gas source, while star formation and galactic winds act as sinks. We take the cosmological mass inflow rate of gas into a dark matter halo of mass Mh at redshift z to be [formula] [\citep=dekel09]. We assume that the cosmological fraction of baryons fb = 16.5 per cent accompanies the dark matter into the halo, and for simplicity we assume the baryons all enter as gas via cold streams (rather than mergers). Although recent simulations raise doubt that cold streams can penetrate the halo [\citep=nelson13], they are likely the dominant mode of galaxy fueling in low mass halos at high-z. Star-formation (as described above) removes gas from the galaxy's reservoir, and we assume that young stars drive galactic winds that eject gas from the galaxy at a rate equal to the SFR.

Using these equations to track the turbulent energy, star-formation, and gas reservoir, we evolve a model galaxy over cosmic time with a simple numerical integration scheme. To make the discussion concrete, we focus on a Milky Way progenitor galaxy with an initial halo mass of [formula] at z = 6 and a final (z = 0) halo mass of [formula]. The galaxy has an initial baryonic mass of [formula], an initial gas fraction of 75 per cent, and an initial velocity dispersion of 50 km s- 1, but the galaxy rapidly evolves towards an equilibrium independent of these choices.

Results of the inflow model

Figure [\ref=fig.time_series] compares the results of our fiducial coupled-inflow model with a control model, in which inflow is decoupled from the disk. In the decoupled model, the galaxy has the same mass inflow rate, but we neglect any energy coupling between inflows and the disk.

At z > 2 in our infall model (solid blue lines), inflows are strongly coupled to the galactic disk. They deposit turbulent energy into the disk, causing a boost in the velocity dispersion (bottom panel). The boosted velocity dispersion slightly lowers the average gas density of the galaxy, thus lowering the global SF efficiency and SFR. Because the SF efficiency is suppressed, gas is allowed to accumulate in the galaxy, leading to a sustained high gas fraction (higher by a factor of [formula]). The specific SFR remains almost unchanged compared to the control model because both the SFR and stellar mass are suppressed by infall.

At z = 2 the coupling between the infalling cold streams and galaxy disk becomes less efficient (with an abruptness owing to our simple assumptions about Ainfall). This occurs when the typical filament size equals the size of the galaxy disk. When the coupling weakens, the turbulent energy in the disk decays, causing the velocity dispersion to decline (bottom panel near z = 2). This leads to an increase in gas density that causes a brief spike in the SFR (top panel). The gas fraction begins to decrease and eventually the SFR does as well, and all quantities converge toward the "decoupled inflow" model at low redshifts. The galaxy converges towards its normal state as a self-regulated, star-forming disk.

In summary, the main effect of infalling gas is to increase the velocity dispersion, "puff up" the galaxy disk, lower the SFR and SF efficiency, and increase the gas fraction. These effects persist as long as the coupling between infalling gas and the galaxy disk is strong (as we have assumed). When the coupling becomes weak (at [formula] in our model), the galaxy converges towards the solution where infalling gas is decoupled from the disk.

Simulations

To test our model, we simulate the accretion of cold gas flows by young galaxies with the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code ramses [\citep=teyssier02]. A key difference with existing idealized and cosmological simulations is that we ensure relatively high resolution in low-density gas, at the expense of the maximal resolution in the densest regions. We start with a coarse grid of resolution 1.0 kpc, and refine each cell into eight smaller cells when its gas mass exceeds 200 [formula] and/or it contains more than 240 particles (of stars and/or dark matter). The maximal resolution of 32 pc is ensured as soon as the gas number density exceeds 0.2 cm- 3 (with 64 pc resolution at 0.025 cm- 3). We allow cooling down to 104 K and enforce a pressure floor to keep the Jeans length resolved by at least four cells.

Old stars, new stars and dark matter are modeled with particles of 2  ×  103, 800, and 8  ×  103 M[formula], respectively. Star-formation occurs in gas denser than 1 cm- 3, with an efficiency of 0.01 per local gravitational free-fall time [\citep=zuckerman74]. The low density threshold ensures that variations in the SFR are not caused by artefacts near the highest resolvable densities, although in practice most of the SFR is obtained from gas at and above 100 cm- 3. We include stellar feedback - photoionization and radiation pressure, using the [\citet=renaud13] model with a trapping parameter κ  =  5, and supernovae feedback: ten Myrs after its birth, a star particle dumps thermal energy in the nearest gas cell, at a rate of 1051 ergs for each [formula] of progenitor mass. We account for non-thermal processes in supernova remnants by decreasing the gas cooling rate in the affected cells, as proposed by [\citet=teyssier13]. This can also be seen as a way to prevent over-cooling of the thermal phases in supernovae remnants [\citep=stinson06].

We use two galaxy models, roughly representative of progenitors of Milky Way-mass galaxies at redshifts z  ≈  5 and z  ≈  1 - 2. They start with a stellar mass of 1.3  ×  109 M[formula] for z  ≈  5 (respectively 8.0  ×  1010 M[formula] for z  ≈  1 - 2) and a gas fraction of 75 per cent (resp. 50 per cent). The disk scale-length is 1.8 kpc (resp. 4 kpc) and a bulge of radius 240 pc (resp. 500 pc) contains 15 per cent of the stellar mass. Dark matter halos with NFW profiles are used with concentration parameters set to 7.0. A hot (>  106K) atmosphere is included with an homogeneous density (a few ×  10- 5 cm- 3) such that the mass comprised in the dark halo virial radius is 37% of the disk mass.

Each galaxy is modeled with and without accreting cosmological streams. The inflow rate is 15 M[formula] yr- 1 for the z  ≈  5 case and 80 M[formula] yr- 1 for the z  ≈  1 - 2 one - for the lower-mass, higher-redshift progenitor, this corresponds to a twelve times higher specific inflow rate at z  ≈  5, as expected from theory (cf. §[\ref=sec.model]). The inflowing gas is introduced in three streams. The streams originate at a distance from the galaxy center equal to 1.2 times the virial radius of the dark matter halo. They have a circular cross-section with an azimuthal profile as follows: a central density set by the required inflow rate, an exponential decay with a scale-length equal to the galaxy disk radius, and a truncation at 2.5 times this scale length. In the disk frame, the streams are set to cross the virial radius at latitudes of (+35, -45 and +65) degrees, respectively, and longitudes of (-90,+90 and +180) degrees, respectively. They contain respectively 45, 35 and 20 percent of the mass inflow rate, have impact parameters of 1.5, 2.0 and 1.5 disk scale lengths with prograde orientations except for the third and weakest one. This configuration, while arbitrary, is consistent with cosmological simulations [\citep=danovich12], and so is the gas density along the flow axis (0.01 - 0.05 cm- 3, [formula] times lower than the average initial density in the galaxy).

Simulation results

We simulate each galaxy for [formula] rotation periods (300 +  Myr). Figure [\ref=fig.disk_image] shows edge-on gas maps of the two low-mass [formula] galaxies at t = 107 Myrs. The cold inflows puff up the disk, leaving the galaxy with fewer regions at the highest densities. Inflows increase the effective scale height from 325 pc to 612 pc, and the half-mass radius from 2.12 kpc to 2.86 kpc. We measure mass-weighted gas velocity dispersions and star-formation rates within 5 kpc of the galaxy center, along with radial profiles of gas surface density and an estimate of the Toomre Q parameter (assuming the gas and stellar velocity dispersions are equal). The velocity dispersion in the inflows simulation is higher by a factor of [formula], leading to a thicker disk and a SF efficiency lower by a factor of [formula]. The figure also shows the (volume) density PDFs of the two simulations, illustrating that cold inflows can reduce the amount of gas at high, star-forming densities above 100 cm- 3. The lower right panels show that the central gas surface density, Σgas, is actually decreased due to inflows. Rather than merely adding gas to the galaxy, the inflows contribute energy that stabilises the disk at all radii, as indicated by the boosted Toomre Q parameter.

Thus abundant, filamentary cold gas inflows can disturb small galaxies at [formula], boosting the velocity dispersion and effectively lowering the SFR. For more massive galaxies at lower redshifts, the cold streams do not affect the gas disk as strongly, as demonstrated by our [formula] simulations. In these simulations the velocity dispersion is barely changed (53 km s- 1 with inflows versus 47 km s- 1 without), and the SF efficiency remains within [formula] per cent, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig.sfe_highmass]. This agrees qualitatively with the 'high-redshift' simulations of [\citet=hopkins13_turb], which are broadly representative of massive [formula] galaxies. We speculate that the ~  10  ×   higher specific inflow rate ([formula]) in our low-mass [formula] galaxies leads to a stronger coupling between infalling gas and the disk. Cosmological simulations - even zoom-ins - generally lack the resolution in the low-density circum-galactic gas to model this effect accurately [\citep=danovich12] [\citep=dubois12_feeding].

These simulations imply that energy from infalling streams can, at least under some circumstances, couple strongly to the galactic disk. In our analytic model (§[\ref=sec.model]) we posit that the coupling (Ainfall) is strong at z > 2 and then weakens as the streams become larger than the galaxy. Our simulations, though limited in the scope of parameter space, suggest instead a dependence of the coupling on halo mass or specific accretion rate. This dependence also leads to reduced SF efficiency at high-z followed by a transition to normal efficiency at lower z. Another possibility is that cold streams are disrupted before they fully penetrate the halo [\citep=nelson13] - while such disruption precludes interaction with the disk, it could effectively delay star-formation by prolonging the time spent in the circum-galactic reservoir. In our simulations the streams penetrate an idealised hot atmosphere without disruption, but cosmological simulations with high resolution in a more realistic circum-galactic gas distribution may be needed to confirm this result. Although some physical details remain in question, our model and simulations support a scenario where infalling cold streams delay star formation in low-mass galaxies at high-z, but have little effect on their more massive descendents at [formula].

Conclusion

Our simple model of cold gas inflows into high-redshift galaxies shows that if the coupling between inflows and the gas disk is strong, then inflows can lower the star-formation efficiencies by factors of 3 and keep gas fractions above 40 per cent until z < 2. While previous models suggest the coupling between inflows and the disk is fairly weak [\citep=klessen10] [\citep=hopkins13_turb], our simulations with inflows show that this coupling can be strong if enough gas is inflowing. When the coupling is strong, cold flows don't settle into a self-regulated disk, but rather stir up the disk and suppress star-formation. Our work implies that in the high-z Universe where galaxies are small and inflow rates are large, the energetic injection of cold inflows has an important impact on galaxy evolution.
