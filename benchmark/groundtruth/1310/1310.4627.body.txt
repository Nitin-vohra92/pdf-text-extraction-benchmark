Introduction

The target space duality, T-duality, is an important symmetry and it exhibits special attribute of string theory. We do not encounter a symmetry of such a nature in quantum field theories. I am recapitulating a few salient aspects of T-duality. There are excellent introductions to T-duality in several books on string theory [\cite=books] [\cite=booksa] [\cite=booksb] [\cite=booksc] [\cite=bookd] [\cite=booke] [\cite=bookf]. A number of very good review articles [\cite=rev] [\cite=rev1] [\cite=rev2] [\cite=rev3] [\cite=rev4] [\cite=reva] [\cite=revb] [\cite=revjm] provide pedagogical treatment of T-duality as well.

In order to qualitatively comprehend T-duality symmetry, let us focus our attention on a closed bosonic string in critical spacetime dimensions, 26, and assume that one of its spatial dimensions is compactified on a circle of radius R. The excitations along this direction (besides the contributions from the oscillators) will have momentum proportional to 1 / R as is the case in Kaluza-Klein compactification. However, since string is an extended one dimensional object, it can wind around the S1 and therefore, the energy is proportional to sum of two terms (i) a term 1 / R due to the KK mechanism and (ii) contributions from winding term which is proportional to R. The perturbative spectrum of closed string, one of whose spatial dimension is compactified on S1 with radius R, matches with that of another closed string for which the corresponding spatial coordinate is also compactified on a circle of radius [formula]. Thus the spectrum of the two theories are identical and the case of latter its KK modes and winding modes are interchanged with those of the former. This is the R  ↔  1  /  R T-duality symmetry. In a more general compactification scheme, when we consider the dimensional reduction of the string effective action on a torus and assume that the background fields do not depend on the coordinates of the compact directions, the T-duality group corresponds to the noncompact O(d,d) symmetry group, d being the number of compactified dimensions. Thus given a set of backgrounds satisfying the constraints imposed by worldsheet conformal invariance, one can judiciously implement O(d,d) transformation and generate a new set of inequivalent backgrounds. These backgrounds are such that they cannot be connected to the original backgrounds through 'gauge transformations' i.e. through general coordinate transformations associated with the target space metric G or the gauge transformation of the two form potential B, if the effective action is obtained from the worldsheet σ model in the presence of the backgrounds G and B. The effective action is derived through the computation of the β-function of the σ model where the backgrounds G and B play the role of coupling constants. Moreover, as is well known, T-duality has played a very important role in study of string cosmology, in black hole physics and in the context of Dp-branes. The target space duality has been investigated from the perspective of the string worldsheet. I advocate the point of view that this approach provides us a deeper understanding of the symmetry since this duality is intimately related to the fact that string is a one-dimensional object. As mentioned above when we toroidally compactify some spatial dimensions and dimensionally reduce the effective action, the resulting lower dimensional action is expressed in manifestly O(d,d) invariant form. When we resort to the worldsheet description, some careful analysis is necessary in order to reveal the underlying O(d,d) symmetry. The standard Polyakov worldsheet action of the compactified theory is not invariant under O(d,d) transformations. Indeed, it is customary to introduce dual (string) coordinates for the compact coordinates (which satisfy the same worldsheet boundary conditions as the original compact coordinates) and dual backgrounds [\cite=duff] [\cite=mahat] [\cite=ms] (these are independent of compact coordinates) which live along compact directions. Thus we construct a dual action in terms of the dual compact coordinates and the corresponding dual backgrounds. The 'spacetime' string coordinates and the backgrounds (which transform as spacetime tensors) are inert under T-duality thus this part of the worldsheet action is retained as it is. Next, one obtains the Euler-Lagrange's equations of motion for the compact string coordinates in the presence of backgrounds as well as the equations of motion resulting from dual action. If the number of compact coordinates is d, then we have, in total, 2d set of equations of motion. The two sets of equations of motion can be suitably rearranged to cast them in an O(d,d) covariant form. The results derived for closed bosonic string can also be derived for NSR superstring with certain modifications and technical improvements [\cite=jmnsr] over previous works [\cite=dm] [\cite=warren] [\cite=rest] [\cite=resta] [\cite=restb] [\cite=restc]. It is evident that T-duality is an important symmetry and it has played a very important role to generate new background configuration from known ones. Especially, it has been utilized very crucially in study of string cosmology [\cite=reva] [\cite=revb] and in the physics of stringy back holes from diverse directions [\cite=duff1] [\cite=youm] [\cite=just]. The purpose of this article is to exhibit how T-duality can be applied to study scattering of string states. Let us very briefly summarize the steps for constructing scattering amplitudes for the closed string states in the first quantized formalism. The first ingredient is the vertex operator associated with the stringy states. It is required to satisfy a set of general principles (see Section 3). These vertex operators are generally constructed in the weak field approximation; for example, graviton is a massless excitation. Thus for the graviton, in this approximation, we consider a weak field around the Minkowski metric. Therefore, the vacuum is the free string vacuum and all correlators/Green's functions are evaluated in this frame work. As a consequence, in computation of three point function or any N-point functions, involving any of the stringy states, we have the product of the corresponding set of normal ordered vertex operators. Then one can adopt any of the well defined formalisms to compute the scattering amplitudes. As alluded to above, we can generate new backgrounds from known backgrounds by implementing O(d,d) transformations. In this proposal, we intend to generate new scattering amplitudes from a given amplitude with judicious implementation T-duality symmetry. Therefore,in order to achieve this goal, we have to adopt the weak field approximation. We outline the prescription below. Let us consider the moduli G and B arising from the dimensional reduction of the graviton and the antisymmetric tensor field from the two massless states of a closed string in (say) critical dimensions. The duality transformation rules for the each of the individual scalars G and B separately is quite involved; even that of G + B is not very simple either. Therefore, in order to study the emergence of T-duality symmetry, O(d,d) when it is compactified on Td, it is very convenient to introduce the so called M-matrix (see the next Section for more details). The new backgrounds, say G' and B', are generated by first implementing T-duality transformation on M-matrix (to get an M'-matrix) and extract G' and B' from M'-matrix. In the context of scattering of moduli and/or their counter parts arising from dimensional reduction of excited massive level, first we have to lay down the procedure. We adopt the weak field approximation for the backgrounds (say G and B). Next task is to construct the corresponding vertex operators in this frame work. However, if we intend to study duality transformations on the desired scattering amplitude, the vertex operators as such associated with G and B, are not quite suitable. Therefore, I feel that we must first construct the corresponding M-matrix and incorporate the weak field approximation to this matrix to begin with. I have introduced a proposal to construct the desired vertex operators originally starting from the M-matrix itself. I argue that, within my prescription, we can implement T-duality on three point and higher point functions since it acts on the vertex operators. Thus starting from a given amplitude a new amplitude can be generated by implementing T-duality operations. The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we examine how O(d,d) transformations are implemented for weak background fields and study their consequences. Section 3 contains some applications of our proposal. First, we consider a 3-point function, consisting of three vertex operators of massless states. These states arise from compactification of [formula]-dimensional graviton to lower dimension and these external legs are on shell. Then we argue how this vertex can be transformed under T-duality describing another 3-point function. I have studied T-duality symmetry associated with excited massive states of closed bosonic string [\cite=jmmass] [\cite=revjm]. I construct the three point vertex involving the first excited massive state vertex operator and two other vertex operators for scalars arising from dimensional reduction of the graviton. I also give an explicit example of T-duality transformation when we compactify on T2 and the corresponding duality group is O(2,2). There is a formalism due to Kawai, Llewellen and Tye [\cite=klt] where they demonstrate that the tree level closed string N-point amplitudes can be expressed in a factorized form in terms of open string N-point amplitudes. I utilize this formalism and propose a new way to implement T-duality transformations on closed string amplitude when the string is compactified to lower D spacetime dimension with d compactified dimensions. In particular,this formalism looks quite promising if we consider higher excited massive states and their tree level amplitudes Then I consider a 4-point amplitude to implement T-duality in weak fiend approximation for tachyon and a gauge boson. This gauge boson arises due to the isometries associated with dimensional reduction. The T-duality transformation emerges elegantly when we appeal to [\cite=klt] with appropriate modifications suitable for our proposal in this work. I present an argument how my proposal will work for scattering involving massive excited state with other states. Section 4 contains discussions and conclusions.

T-duality in Weak Background Approximation

Let us first recapitulate some of the salient features of T-duality from the worldsheet point of view. Consider evolution of a closed bosonic string in [formula] spacetime dimensions in the background of its massless excitations, graviton and antisymmetric fields denoted by Ĝ and B̂.

[formula]

where γab is the worldsheet flat (inverse) metric. [formula]. The backgrounds depend on string coordinates [formula]. This is identified as the two dimensional σ model action. [formula] and [formula] are to be treated as coupling constants. In order to get an intuitive perspective, let us assume, for the time being that Ĝ and B̂ are independent of [formula]. The canonical Hamiltonian density is expressed in terms of [formula]-matrix (see below) [\cite=mmatrix] [\cite=matrixa] [\cite=matrixb] [\cite=matrixc] [\cite=matrix2] [\cite=matrix2x] [\cite=matrix2a] [\cite=matrix2ay]

[formula]

where P̂ are conjugate momenta of [formula]. The Hamiltonian density, Hc is invariant under global [formula] transformations

[formula]

[formula] is symmetric and transforms as

[formula]

where

[formula]

and η0 is the O(,) metric.

[formula]

where [formula] is [formula] unit matrix and [formula]. Let us consider the scenario when the [formula]-dimensional manifold is decomposed such that we have a lower dimensional spacetime manifold MD and a compact manifold Kd .i.e. [formula]. Let the coordinates on M be denoted by Xμ,μ = 0,1..D - 1 and those on Kd by Yα,α = 1,2,...d so that [formula]. Further more, in adopting Scherk-Schwarz [\cite=ss] dimensional reduction, it is assumed, in this work, that all the backgrounds depend on spacetime coordinates Xμ only. When we examine the worldsheet action ([\ref=poly]), we note that all backgrounds, when appropriately decomposed, depend only on the string coordinate Xμ. Next we decompose the [formula]-dimensional tensors Ĝ and B̂ to lower dimensions [\cite=ms] and as is well known, we get tensors, vectors and scalars in lower spacetime dimension D. The vierbein formalism for the metric is convenient for our purpose and the vierbein which defines the [formula]-dimensional metric is given by

[formula]

The spacetime metric is gμν = erμg(0)rsesν and the internal metric is Gαβ = EaαδabEbβ; g(0)rs is the D-dimensional flat space Lorentzian signature metric. A(1)βμ are gauge fields associated with the d-isometries and it is assumes that the backgrounds depend on coordinates Xμ and are independent of Yα. Similarly, the antisymmetric tensor background, depending only on Xμ can be decomposed as

[formula]

As expected, there are gauge fields, Bμα(X), arising from the compactification of B̂. After the dimensional reduction, we also encounter the M-matrix which belongs to T-duality group O(d,d). It is given by

[formula]

Note that M∈O(d,d) and therefore, it satisfies the usual constraints, MηM  =  η and η, the O(d,d) metric is

[formula]

and 1 is d  ×  d unit matrix. Under the O(d,d) transformation, M  →  ΩMΩT and the metric η remains invariant. In order to generate new nontrivial backgrounds, starting from an initial set of backgrounds, we apply desired O(d,d) transformations. For sake of simplicity, let us set Aαμ = 0 and Bμα(X) = 0 (note that these two gauge field can be combined following the rules of dimensional reduction and this combination of the gauge fields transforms as a vector under O(d,d) transformations [\cite=ms]). The the Hamiltonian density corresponding to internal coordinates {Yα} is given by

[formula]

[formula] are the momenta conjugate to Yα, here 'dot' and 'prime' denotes derivative with respect to the worldsheet coordinates τ and σ respectively. The vertex operator associated with Gαβ(X) can be identifies as [formula]. In terms of phase space variables it is: Gαβ(X)PαPβ + Gαβ(X)Y'αY'β. If we intend to compute, for example, scattering of two of these massless particles, we have to resort to approximation scheme as has been discussed in the previous section. The conventional method is to adopt weak field approximation. As an illustrative example, consider vertex operators for spacetime graviton. Here we write

[formula]

where g(0)μν is the flat Minkowski space metric and 'a' is a small expansion parameter (is related to Newton's constant in linearized approximation of Einstein-Hilbert action) and h̃μν(X) is the graviton in the weak field approximation . Then the graviton vertex is

[formula]

and the canonical momentum is defined from the free string Lagrangian, [formula]; moreover, [formula] and [formula]. The vertex operator ([\ref=gvertex]) is required to be (1,0) and (0,1) primary with respect to the free string stress energy momentum tensors, T+  + and T-  - respectively and these are given by

[formula]

Now we quote the standard result when we demand ([\ref=gvertex]) to have conformal weight (1,1).

[formula]

Here [formula] is the flat space D-dimensional Laplacian. If we express h̃μν = eik.Xεμν, ~ εμν being the polarization tensor of graviton. The above constraints translate to the familiar equations,

[formula]

Similarly, we can write

[formula]

and b(0)μν is the constant antisymmetric tensor, analog of g(0)μν. However, presence of this constant antisymmetric tensor in the free string worldsheet action, does not contribute to the equations of motion (we are dealing with noncompact string coordinates) and we can still decompose Xμ(σ,τ) = XμL  +  XμR. Thus we can ignore the presence of this constant tensor in all our subsequent discussion. Moreover, [formula] also satisfies similar constraints as h̃μν(X) as above

[formula]

Similarly, for the backgrounds Gαβ and Bαβ we adopt the weak field approximation

[formula]

and 'a' being the expansion parameter. Although we might loosely use the term toroidal compactification, it is understood that we do not account for special features of winding modes etc in this investigation. Note that Gαβ and Bαβ transform as scalars (these are moduli) from the point of view of D-dimensional spacetime and these are symmetric and antisymmetric under α  ↔  β respectively. Moreover, hαβ and bαβ also share the same attributes. If we demand the vertex operators [formula] and [formula] to be (1,1) primaries with respect to

[formula]

then we arrive at

[formula]

We remark in passing that if we had considered the gauge fields Aαμ and Bαμ they will couple to the worldsheet coordinates Xμ and Yα. The conformal invariance implies equations of motion

[formula]

and the transversality conditions

[formula]

If we had envisaged the [formula]-dimensional worldsheet action with backgrounds Ĝ and B̂, the conformal invariance will lead to equations of motion of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are to be understood as weak field expansions of Ĝ and B̂. We also obtain the appropriate transversality conditions on these background. Note that, upon dimensional reduction Ĝ  →  {gμν,Aαμ,Gαβ} and B̂  →  {Bμν,Bαμ,Bαβ} and the conditions we have derived above are the same i.e. the tensors and gauge fields satisfy equations of motion and transversality conditions. Whereas the moduli satisfy equations of motion as given above. In the Hamiltonian formulation, the vertex operators can be obtained too. Moreover, in the weak field approximation the canonical momenta are taken to be the τ derivative of the corresponding string coordinates. If we focus attention on the compact coordinates {Yα} and assume they couple to corresponding backgrounds (we confine to massless excitations) which only carry Xμ dependence then we could explore T-duality properties of the vertex operators. Since the Hamiltonian density ([\ref=hamiltonian]) is T-duality invariant, we may obtain nontrivial new backgrounds by implementing T-duality transformations and the string will propagate in these backgrounds. These backgrounds are desired to fulfill constraints of conformal invariance. However, if we intend to consider interactions such as three point and four point functions (or even N-point functions), then the vertex operators obtained from ([\ref=hamiltonian]) are not useful and we should resort to the weak field approximation. In view of preceding remarks, I propose to define the M-matrix ([\ref=matrixm]), in the weak field approximation, as follows

[formula]

where [formula] is the 2d  ×  2d unit matrix, 'a' is the small expansion parameter. Sometimes we omit the presence of of 'a' in such an expansion. However, it is always understood that such weak field 'fluctuations' are due to the presence of 'a' even if it does not appear explicitly. The backgrounds G- 1, G and B appearing in the definition of M, ([\ref=matrixm]) have weak field expansions ([\ref=weakgb]) as alluded to earlier. Therefore, [formula] can be expressed in terms of hαβ, hαβ and bαβ (note that hαβ and hαβ are related and see below). Since M∈O(d,d) it satisfies the constraint MηM = η,

[formula]

Note that [formula] is not an O(d,d) matrix unlike M. Furthermore, from the relation GαβGβγ  =  δγα, we get

[formula]

when we retain terms to order 'a' in expansion ([\ref=wfield]). The above relation between hαβ and hαβ is consistent with the constraint ([\ref=mtilde]). Moreover, by retaining terms to order 'a', we notice that block the diagonal elements of [formula] are hαβ and hαβ and the two off diagonal block elements are - b and b. Thus [formula] is also a symmetric matrix like M-matrix; however, it has to satisfy ([\ref=mtilde]). Now I present the steps as how to generate new set of backgrounds from given backgrounds. Let us start with initial backgrounds Gin and Bin and define the matrix Min and corresponding [formula] in order to implement the weak field approximation. Let Ω be the desired O(d,d) transformation. Then the new matrix, Mf is given by

[formula]

I adopt the prescription that just as Min has weak field approximation [formula], having obtained Mf, it will have weak field expansion [formula]. In order to decompose Mf in this manner we might have to rescale the new metric appearing in the definition of Mf obtained through ([\ref=mf]). Let us explore more about [formula]. Recall that [\cite=ms] we can write an O(d,d) matrix

[formula]

satisfying ΩTηΩ  =  η. With this decomposition G + B transform as quotients reminiscent of SL(2,R) transformation and this avenue does not take us too far to get handle on new backgrounds as can be seen by working out the details and try to carry out the weak field approximation for the transformed G + B. Therefore, we incorporate the T-duality transformation through the Ω transformation on the M-matrix. Let us assume that under T-duality

[formula]

We can obtain G' by inverting top left block matrix G'- 1 and then easily extract antisymmetric B' matrix. As mentioned earlier, then carry out the weak field approximation. Notice that G' and B' will be expressed in terms of G and B once we specify an O(d,d) transformation (see the next section for an explicit example). It is obvious from examination of ([\ref=oddtrans]) that the right hand side off diagonal block matrix will eventually lead to extraction of nontrivial B' in general. Now we are in a position to implement T-duality on scattering amplitudes.

Scatterings in the Weak Field Approximation

In this section we explore how one can apply T-duality transformation on a scattering amplitude to relate it to another one. Our strategy is as follows. Let us consider a three point function i.e. product of three vertex operators. We start with a vertex operator, call it V(1), with only [formula] and two other vertex operators. Next, we decide to apply T-duality on V(1), then under this transformation hαβ  →  h'αβ and it can have an additional term [formula] although the antisymmetric field bαβ was absent to start with. This is achieved follows according to our proposal . Given initially an hαβ we construct the corresponding [formula]. Then we implement the O(d,d) transformation on Min constructed from [formula] to generate Mf. Thus [formula] can be defined once Mf is generated and finally we shall extract b'αβ. This procedure is an application for compactification on Td (we ignore effects of windings etc.). Let us consider a simple example to illustrate the point. We start with T2 compactification of a bosonic string such that we have nontrivial Gαβ as initial background to start with and Bαβ = 0. Thus under T-duality

[formula]

Explicitly,

[formula]

where Gαβ is symmetric, so is its inverse. Similarly, G'αβ is also symmetric, being the new metric of the internal space and B'αβ is desired to be antisymmetric. Given the metric G'- 1, we can extract B'. We intend to consider a three point function and examine how T-duality can be applied to generate a new three point function. Let us consider a vertex with three massless scalar gravitons G(1)α1β1, G(2)α2β2 and G(3)α3β3. These arise from compactification of the metric in [formula]-dimension to D-dimensions and we may refer to them as 'scalar graviton' from now on. First we have to construct the vertex operators in the weak field approximation as has been discussed earlier. The generic vertex operator for this case, [formula] is expressed as

[formula]

where l = 1,2,3, εh(l)αlβl is the 'polarization tensor' of the scalar graviton and it is symmetric in its indices. Superscript h(l) reminds that it is 'polarization tensor' associated with hαβ for the lth vertex operator. Note that eiKl.Xl stands for the plane wave for lth scalar and the plane wave depends only on the spacetime coordinates. Thus, due to the absence of dependence on (Yα, ~ Pα) in the plane wave part, hαβ(X) propagates in the noncompact spacetime. We may call attention of the reader to the fact that here we are not taking into account presence of winding modes etc. due to the choice of the propagating plane wave. The vertex operator with a general structure is required to satisfy the following invariance properties [\cite=wein1] [\cite=wein2] [\cite=phongd1] [\cite=phongd2] [\cite=ryu]. (i) Spacetime translation. It is already satisfied since we have explicitly factored out the 'plane wave' here. (ii) Spacetime Lorentz transformation. Note that the indices α and β represent those of compact coordinates. Thus Lorentz invariance is automatically respected. (iii) General two dimensional coordinate transformation. We have already adopted the conformal gauge for worldsheet metric. (iv) Conformal invariance of the vertex operator. Notice that the requirements (iii) and (iv) are fulfilled if k2l = 0 is satisfied with the choice of the above vertex operator. We shall not present the explicit evaluation of the three point vertex here which can be computed by following standard procedures [\cite=books] [\cite=booksa] [\cite=bookd] [\cite=booke] for example. Thus the three point function is

[formula]

zi and [formula] are complexified worldsheet coordinates. The normal ordered vertex operators are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We can arbitrarily fix three coordinates of the worldsheet z1,z2,z3 for this three point function ([\ref=threept]) and its computation is well known using techniques given in the text books [\cite=books] [\cite=booksa] [\cite=bookd] [\cite=booke] and we shall not repeat them. However, we shall present how we can generate a new three point function from A3 by applying T-duality. We could apply three different T-duality transformations on V(1), V(2) and V(3); however, it will suffice to apply the transformation on one of the vertex operators, say V(1), to bring out the essential argument. Given h(1)α1β1(X) now taken to be εh(1)α1β1eiK1.X1 we note that the plane wave part i.e. eiK1.X1 is inert under T-duality. Therefore, given a 'polarization' εh(1)α1β1 we can reconstruct Gα1β1 = 1 + εh(1)α1β1 since εh(1)α1β1 is an element of the [formula]-matrix. We omit the explicit the factor of the plane wave eiK1.X1 whose presence or absence does not affect the arguments in sequel. After implementing the T-duality transformation we can reconstruct the new backgrounds; that is ε'h(1)α1β1 and generate another component ε'b(1)α1β1 corresponding an antisymmetric 'polarization' tensor. Such a tensor would have appeared if we would initially start with backgrounds G'α1β1 and B'α1β1 and then resorted to the weak field approximation and eventually expressed the weak fields as product of a plane wave and 'polarization' tensor. I shall present an explicit and simple O(2,2) transformation matrix later and another example of a three point function which involves an excited massive stringy state and two of the massless 'scalar gravitons'. Let us consider three point function of a massive scalar arising from compactification of the first excited massive state of a closed string and two scalars coming from the massless sector as above. We briefly recall how such a scalar arises from the toroidal compactification. There are three terms in the vertex operator for the first excited massive state. For this case the one corresponding to the leading Regge trajectory is a physical state, the other two can be gauged away. This argument becomes physically transparent if we count physical degrees of freedom in the light cone gauge (also see [\cite=wein1] [\cite=wein2]). The vertex operator is sum of four terms,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that [formula] is symmetric under interchange of either [formula] or [formula] and also simultaneous interchange of these pair of indices. However, there is no a priori reason to impose any symmetry constraints on interchange of unprimed and primed indices. The three other terms in ([\ref=mvertex]) V2, V3 and V4 are

[formula]

and

[formula]

We do not entertain terms containing [formula] or [formula] in any vertex operators since they vanish by virtue of free string equations of motion. This argument also holds for vertex operators involving Xμ and compact coordinates Yα when we consider the case of compactified string coordinates. The vertex operator V1 corresponds to the state lying on leading Regge trajectory. The requirement of the condition that V1 be (1,1) primary imposes constraints on [formula]. However, note that same is not applicable to [formula], [formula] and [formula]. These three are not independently (1,1) primaries although they satisfy mass shell condition and appropriate [\cite=ov1] [\cite=ov1a] [\cite=kr] [\cite=ao] transversality conditions. These three are related to [formula]. We have mentioned earlier that we shall only focus attentions on V1 and therefore, we shall not dwell on attributes of V2, V3 and V4 in what follows. If we demand [formula] to be of conformal weight (1,1) with respect to T+  +(X̂) and T-  -(X̂) the the following constraints are to be satisfied by [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is the [formula]-dimensional Laplacian defined with the flat space metric. Furthermore, in analogy with the graviton [formula] in [formula]-dimensional graviton, [formula] also satisfies transversality and gauge conditions [\cite=ov1] [\cite=ov1a].

[formula]

Let us consider compactification of [formula] to D spacetime dimension. Thus the expression for V1 decomposes into sum of several terms and we discuss their structures below very briefly. (I) There will be a term where the F(1) tensor will have four D-dimensional Lorentz indices of the form [formula].

(II) There will be a term will all internal indices i.e. those lie along compact directions. This is of the form [formula]. We remark that, so far as F(1)μν,μ'ν' and F(1)αβ,α'β' are concerned, their symmetry properties under the interchange of indices are identical as those of [formula] as noted earlier.

(III) There will a structure with three Lorentz indices and one internal with appropriate contractions with ∂X and ∂Y and/or antiholomorphic parts. A generic term is [formula]. There are three more terms of this type with various indices and only feature is that there are three Lorentz indices and one internal index (total four terms).

(IV) There is another structure which has one Lorentz index and three internal indices. All the F(1)'s satisfy the mass shell condition since [formula] does so. Moreover, ~  ~  [formula]. There are also three more terms of this form.

(V) Finally there are six terms (in all) which have two Lorentz indices and two internal indices. A generic term of this type is [formula]. We observe that the vertex operator defined in (I) above is inert under T-duality. F(1)μν,μ'β', appearing in (III) transforms as a third rank tensor and has only one internal index and therefore, the internal direction is affected under T-duality transformation. Similarly, F(1)μβ,α'β' transforms as a vector under Lorentz transformations and therefore, it will satisfy transversality condition like a gauge field. Finally, in case of the tensor appearing in (V) which has two Lorentz indices and two internal indices, it transforms like a second rank spacetime tensor. We have presented our arguments elsewhere, how we can combine the 16 terms appearing in (I) to (V) to show that this combined vertex operator can be cast in O(d,d) invariant form. We refer the interested reader to these articles [\cite=jmmass] [\cite=jmplb] [\cite=revjm]. Our focus is on the term defined in (II) which correspond to scalars when we envisage their spacetime transformation properties. We recall that it is symmetric under interchange of α  ↔  α' and also under β  ↔  β'. The states arise from composition of left and right mover and the form is consistent with the level matching condition [formula]; the super script Y refers to the fact that we are considering only the compact coordinate sector. When we require the vertex operator

[formula]

to be (1,1) primary it satisfies two conditions

[formula]

Here [formula] is the D-dimensional flat space Laplacian. Moreover,

[formula]

If we compare this equation with ([\ref=transg]) then we note that the second term in each of the two relation present in ([\ref=transg]) are absent. It is understood easily since F(1)αβ,α'β' depends only on Xμ. Thus any derivative with respect to Yα acting on F(1)αβ,α'β'(X) vanishes. Now let us express F(1) as a product of a 'polarization tensor and plane wave,

[formula]

It satisfies mass shell condition is k2 = 2. Moreover, the polarization tensor has the properties that it is symmetric independently under (i) α  ↔  β and α'  ↔  β'

[formula]

We would like to construct the three point function for the massive scalar, k2 = 2, and two massless scalar gravitons coming from compactification of the [formula]-dimensional graviton.

[formula]

We may implement T-duality transformations on any one of the tree vertex operators to generate new background as discussed before. Let us consider a specific example when two spacial dimensions are compactified on T2. The duality group is O(2,2) and it is isomorphic to [formula]. Note that the moduli Gαβ and Bαβ parametrize the coset [formula] and it is isomorphic to [formula]. It is easy to see that former has 4 parameters and latter too has same number of parameters. Therefore, an arbitrary T-duality transformation will be specified by four parameters (say if we made two separate SL(2,R) transformations). We consider a very simple O(2,2) transformation to illustrate our prescriptions. Let us start with diagonal Gαβ = (g11, ~ g22) and set Bαβ = 0 as the initial background configuration. Thus the M-matrix is block diagonal. The O(2,2) transformation is defined by a single parameter as was adopted by us [\cite=matrix2a] to study the string cosmology in the Milne universe case and it has interesting consequences. Note that the choice of Ω is similar to the one adopted in [\cite=matrix2a] with a slight difference due to the convention adopted here; however, it fulfills all the requirements of an O(d,d) matrix ([\ref=transodd]).

[formula]

where c = coshγ and s =  sinh γ and γ is a bounded real parameter. It is easy to check that Ω defined above ([\ref=omega]) satisfies requirement of O(2,2) transformation. The initial Min-matrix is

[formula]

If we implement this duality transformation as stipulated in ([\ref=transodd]), we expect to generate new backgrounds. Let

[formula]

We can read off the transformed, G'αβ to be

[formula]

We observe the appearance of the symmetric off diagonal elements g'12 = g'21 as expected. We also note that already nontrivial B' has been generated since we have nonzero elements U13,U14,U23 and U24 corresponding to - G'- 1B'. After inverting G'- 1 we can extract B'. We present the matrix elements for G'- 1B' for sake of completeness.

[formula]

Given these matrix elements, we can extract B' since we can invert ([\ref=newmetric]). A tedious and straight forward calculation shows B'11 = B'22 = 0 as expected. Moreover, B'12 =  - B'21. We give one matrix element below

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

An explicit calculation shows B'12 =  - B'21 and confirms that B' is antisymmetric. The antisymmetric tensor background generated through the duality transformation in expressed in terms of g11,g22,g11 and g22. In order to facilitate weak field expansions for the new backgrounds, our first step will be to adopt weak field expansion for the initial metric, g11  ~  and  ~  g22, its inverse g11  ~  and  ~  g22,

[formula]

and α,α,'β,β' = 1,2. In the expression for the new inverse metric ([\ref=newmetric]), we find that off diagonal elements have appeared and these matrix elements will need to be expanded in the weak field expansion of original gαβ and gαβ. Another point is that, when we resort to weak field expansions for original metric, the newly generated metric starts with a constant (  ≠  1). Thus we should scale this constant part to have a weak field expansion, similar to the initial metric. Second point worth mentioning is that to obtain weak field expansion for B'-field, we should expand the initial metric in this approximation. We find that after this expansion, a constant piece appears in nonzero components of B' as can be seen from the expressions for T1 and T2 given by ([\ref=term1]) and ([\ref=term2]). However, as we argued earlier, the constant piece does not contribute to the equations of motion. Therefore, we may ignore this constant piece, if we so desire, in our subsequent discussions. The antisymmetric tensor field continues to maintain its antisymmetry property after the expansion. Now if we express hαβ(X) = εhαβeiK.X then it is easy to see that

[formula]

We can derive this relation starting from plane wave approximation for hαβ, then construct [formula]. After we implement the transformation ([\ref=omega]) we obtain Mf. Next we derive [formula] and then extract ε'(h') and ε'(b'). Therefore, if we applied this T-duality transformation on one of the legs of the three point function ([\ref=threept]) we shall generate a new three point function with B'-background in the weak field approximation along with the G'. Same argument holds for the other legs, consisting of 'scalar gravitons' in the three point amplitude, Ã3 given by ([\ref=fvertex]). If we want to apply the T-duality transformation on the massive scalar appearing in ([\ref=fvertex]), it is not so straight forward as the case of the 'scalar graviton'. In order to examine how it works, let us explicitly write the terms for this scalar vertex operator ([\ref=yvertex]). It will have altogether 16 terms. We mention in passing that all the tensorial indices corresponding to compact directions are raised and lowered by Kronecker delta here and in particular [formula]. We can group the 16 terms into five classes and define each term to be a vertex function. Thus the vertex operator ([\ref=yvertex]) is sum of 16 vertex functions. I list them below for later conveniences: 1. A term which has products of all {Pα}'s suitably contracted. We have dropped superscript (1) of the F and the expression is :

[formula]

2. Another term which has products of all {Yα}'s. It is

[formula]

3. There are four terms which are composed of product of three Pα and one Yβ:

[formula]

4. There are another group of terms which have product of one Pα and three {Y'β}. These are

[formula]

5. There are six terms in this class. Each term is a product of a pair of Pα's and a pair of Y'β.

[formula]

Let us discuss the T-duality, Pα  ↔  Y'α, which is the discrete Z2 duality. We observe that the two terms given in [formula] and [formula] above interchange. Therefore, if the F's interchange accordingly they are Z2 symmetric. Next, consider the four terms in [formula] and four terms in [formula]. Under this duality we find the combined eight terms are also T-duality invariant. Finally the six terms in [formula] transform among themselves under Pα and Y'α interchange. Furthermore, I have proposed a prescription to express vertex operators of excited massive levels in T-duality invariant form. Therefore, if we start with any vertex function given above then by a suitable O(d,d) transformation or series of such transformations, we can generate other terms [\cite=jmmass]. For example we can write Pα as

[formula]

as mentioned earlier the double Pα and Y'α transform like O(d,d) vector. Thus P+ projects out the upper component. Similarly, projection operator P- projects out the lower component Y'α (see [\cite=jmmass] for details). Moreover, the lower component Y'α can be flipped if we operate the O(d,d) metric η on it. In view of the above arguments, we can start with three point function, Ã3, of the excited first scalar massive level with two 'scalar graviton' in a given configuration for the massive state and implement O(d,d) transformation to generate another configuration. Since T-duality symmetry is expected to be valid in each order of perturbation theory my conjecture is that these transformations to generate new three point functions are expected to hold good beyond the tree level, order by order in perturbation theory. We present another argument which makes T-duality transformation intuitively more appealing for at least some special states when we consider the tree level amplitudes. These are the massive scalars coming from compactification of the state in [formula]-dimension which lie on the leading Regge trajectory. We invoke the arguments of Kawai, Llewellen and Tye [\cite=klt] who provide a very elegant technique to establish relationship between open string and closed string scattering amplitudes at the tree level. First we recapitulate their arguments very briefly and then apply them to the case at hand. In particular, we exploit the formulation of KLT for construction of vertex operators of excited closed string states to the end that the theory is compactified to lower dimension. Subsequently. we modify their approach appropriately to propose vertex operators which have desirable transformation properties under the T-duality transformation. The physical degrees of freedom, for a free closed string, are composed of left-movers and right-movers since the oscillators from these two sectors act on the vacuum. We can treat them independently. Second point to note is that a closed string with only left-moving or right-moving mode is intimately related to open string theory in the mathematical sense. When we compute closed string tree level scattering amplitudes, we have product of vertex operators with multiple integrals. The integrand can be expressed in a factorized form into left moving and right moving sectors. We can identify that these are same as the ones appearing in the open string amplitudes. Of course, there are some subtleties in expressing the N-point closed string tree amplitudes as products of N-point open string amplitudes at tree level. In particular the three point and four point closed string amplitudes can be explicitly written in the factorized form for products of three point and four point open string amplitudes respectively. We recall: (a) the closed string point point function A(3)closed can be determined by fixing the three worldsheet variable arbitrarily (the so called three Koba-Nielsen variables). As KLT [\cite=klt] demonstrated, this three point function is determined in terms of the product of two open string three point function. (b) In case of the 4-point function, the closed string amplitude can be computed once we fix three variables and an analogous factorization was demonstrated. Moreover, they have laid down the prescriptions to compute N-point closed string tree amplitude in the factorized form of products of tree level open string amplitudes. The prospect of going beyond tree level in this kind of approach has been explored in [\cite=mp]. Our principal goal is not so much as to utilize the KLT factorization formula to compute scattering amplitudes; rather we take the clue from this work to construct vertex operators for excited stringy states and study their duality properties from the perspectives of KLT. We argue that their formulation simplifies some calculations for the states coming from the leading Regge trajectories when we envisage the corresponding vertex operators. In order to achieve this objective we recapitulate how vertex operators associated with the excited states be constructed starting from the tachyon vertex operator. While employing the Green's function technique (or the path integral approach) we should use the appropriate boundary conditions for the open string coordinates and closed string coordinates. We shall not dwell on them here. Let us begin with the open string tachyon vertex operator: V(k,X) = :eik.X:. The N-point amplitude is product of these vertex operators located at N different points and integrated over appropriate worldsheet variable. The essential point to note is that the emission vertex for the first excited state can be extracted by looking at OPE of the product of two tachyon vertex operators. From a simple analysis KLT arrive at the known vector boson vertex operator

[formula]

Their observation that this vertex operator can be extracted from a modified expression of tachyon vertex operator leads to interesting and important consequences for the results of [\cite=klt]. The vertex operator they propose is

[formula]

The vertex operator ([\ref=vectb]) can be obtained if we expand ([\ref=klt1]) in powers of ζμ and retain only the linear term. Thus, with this trick, the N-point scattering amplitude of massless vector bosons of open string can be computed. Moreover, they propose that the vertex operators for excited massive open string states can also be constructed

[formula]

where ζ(m).∂X  =  ζ(m)μ.∂Xμ. Thus we can compute amplitudes by assembling multilinear terms in ζ(l)μ after evaluating products of N such operators as argued by KLT. We can resort to similar formulation for evaluation of the amplitudes for closed string excited states. Let us consider the graviton vertex in this perspective. Moreover, we intend to explore duality properties of the vertex operator in this formalism when we compactify the theory. Therefore, we start with vertex operator in [formula]-dimensions. In our notation, if we express ([\ref=oldgvertex]) in terms of the polarization tensor and plane wave

[formula]

This vertex operator satisfies the mass shell condition and the transversality conditions respectively

[formula]

In the formalism of KLT, we can express the vertex operator as

[formula]

Here [formula] and [formula] two vectors contracting with [formula] and [formula] respectively. In order to establish relations between ([\ref=newgvertex]) and ([\ref=kltgvertex]) we should expand the latter and keep terms proportional to [formula]. Note that equations ([\ref=newgvertex]) and ([\ref=kltgvertex]) differ by a factor of 'i' it can be easily taken care of by a suitable redefinition. Moreover, [formula] is symmetric in its indices. One more point might be worth mentioning here. The vertex operator extracted from ([\ref=kltgvertex]) as the coefficient of the biliear in [formula] and [formula] is to be understood as the weak field expression for graviton vertex operator. Thus to bring out this aspect explicitly, we could reintroduce the small parameter 'a' through a scaling

[formula]

Note, however, that the product [formula] can be decomposed as sum of a symmetric and antisymmetric second rank tensor. The symmetric part is identified with the graviton polarization tensor whereas the antisymmetric one is that of the [formula]. Both the polarization tensors satisfy the transversality constraints. Let us examine how the compactification scheme will be introduced in this frame work. As we have explained earlier the polarization tensors will be decomposed to four pieces in this case i.e. [formula]. If we look at the symmetric part of the product [formula] it will decompose into [formula]. Obviously, the first one corresponds to polarization tensor of D-dimensional graviton, the next two are polarization vectors of gauge bosons and last one is to be identified with 'scalar graviton'. Let us carefully analyze the terms appearing in the exponential of ([\ref=kltgvertex]). We have argued earlier that plane wave part of the vertex operator does not depend on the compact coordinates; thus [formula]. Then the pair of terms [formula]. Therefore, when we expand the exponential and retain the bilinear terms as alluded to above, we can identify the symmetric part of the 'polarization' tensors to be the one which couples to the 'scalar graviton' after we have compactified the theory to lower dimension. So far we have not addressed the issue of duality in this scheme. Now I propose the following for the massless sector (the first excited states) and this argument can be generalized to all excited massive levels lying on the leading Regge trajectory. In order to express the compactified vertex operators in KLT scheme we shall go through following steps (I shall confine to the products of [formula] here) 1. We must express ∂Y = P + Y' and [formula] in terms of O(d,d) vectors [\cite=jmmass]. This is achieved by introducing projection operators given by ([\ref=projecto]). If we define an O(d,d) vector

[formula]

then we can express

[formula]

In the above equation ([\ref=py]) P  ±  Y' are to be understood as O(d,d) column vectors. We remind that η flips lower component Y' vector to an upper component one. In order to construct an O(d,d) invariant object out of ζα∂Yα and [formula], we introduce doublets, which transform as O(d,d) vectors, as

[formula]

Thus if we demand that the inner product

[formula]

be O(d,d) invariant, the compactified sector of KLT vertex can be cast in O(d,d) invariant form since the plane wave part eik.X is inert under T-duality transformations. The introduction the doublet of polarization tensors should not surprise us. We encounter appearance of extra fields/parameters in a Lagrangian in order to enforce manifest invariance of the Lagrangian. In fact, when we expressed the Hamiltonian density in manifestly O(d,d) invariant form ([\ref=hamiltonian]), we introduced 2d  ×  2d M-matrix which is of larger dimension. At that point we knew that the standard form of the canonical Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of Gαβ and Bαβ which together have only d2 independent elements. Thus M is not an arbitrary O(d,d) matrix and it is a special one (see Section 3 of ref.[\cite=ms] for details). We can write analog of ([\ref=kltgvertex]) in our formulation for the first excited massless scalar graviton state

[formula]

We can extract the scalar graviton vertex by picking up the bilinear term in [formula] and [formula]. This prescription to construct vertex operators corresponding to compact directions is more elegant and simple than my initial proposal [\cite=jmmass]. However, we note that we have succeeded in utilizing KLT technique for states lying on the leading Regge trajectory in [formula]-dimension and then focusing on the scalars arising from compactification to D-dimension. It is clear that the same argument will hold for background vector fields as well. We can also adopt the prescriptions of [\cite=klt] for excited massive levels coming from compactification of corresponding states in [formula]-dimension to lower dimension. For excited massive levels in [formula]-dimensions one is expected to introduce a number of polarization tensors [formula] and correspondingly [formula] in the exponential. Then expand the exponential and keep multilinear terms, however, the number of [formula] should be exactly the same as those of [formula] in order to fulfill level matching condition for the closed string. When we compactify to lower dimensions, we shall have states with Lorentz tensor indices and internal indices as has been pointed out earlier. Therefore, as before, we should introduce doublets of ζ and [formula] when we have compactified to lower dimensions i.e. we have a set of doublets

[formula]

Note that l = 1,2..n and l' = 1,2...n in order to satisfy level matching condition. We are in a position to discuss the T-duality transformation on the vertex operator associated with excited massive scalar in this frame work. Let us consider the three point function ([\ref=fvertex]). The vertex operator of the massive state ([\ref=planeyvertex]) can be re-expressed as follows

[formula]

The inspection of ([\ref=mvertex]) shows that the contraction of indices of [formula] correspond to the recasting of terms ∂Yα∂Yβ in terms of the projections of W's whereas indices of [formula] contract with those coming from recasting of [formula]. Therefore, the product is symmetric under i  ↔  j and i'  ↔  j'. However, there is no compelling reason regarding such properties under i  ↔  i' and j  ↔  j'. We remind the reader about construction of graviton vertex operator in the KLT formalism: the symmetric product of ζμζν' was associated with graviton polarization whereas the antisymmetric product with the polarization tensor of Bμν. Moreover, both these backgrounds couple to [formula]. For the case at hand the product like, say, [formula] will have symmetric and antisymmetric decompositions in general. We can implement suitable O(d,d) transformations on [formula] each one of which transform as component of an O(d,d) vector (doublet). Therefore, if we start with a given three point function with a specific form of ([\ref=dualityvert]), we can generate a new three point function keeping the two scalar graviton legs unaltered if we so desire. This is an example how T-duality transformation can act with two scalar graviton and a massive scalar k2 = 2. The procedure to construct vertex operators for excited states of a compactified closed string has been outlined above. We can implement T-duality transformations on amplitudes involving an arbitrary vertex operator of this type to generate another amplitude. Now I consider a simple four point amplitude and discuss how T-duality transformation can be applied in the context of the present formulation. Let us consider a four point function for scattering a gauge boson and a tachyon in D-dimensions. We assume that the gauge boson, denoted as Aαμ(X) owes its origin to compactification of [formula]-dimensional graviton. The vertex operator is

[formula]

Here εμα is the polarization vector satisfying transversality condition kμεμα = 0. If we were to generate this vertex operator in the KLT formulation, we shall follow the prescription

[formula]

then keep the bilinear term [formula] in the expansion. This term is to be identified with gauge boson polarization tensor. Let us consider the four point amplitude amplitude for T + Aμα  →  T' + A'νβ where T  ~  and  ~  T' are the incoming and outgoing tachyons and Aμα  ~  and  ~  A'νβ are incoming and outgoing gauge bosons which arise due to compactification of the [formula]-dimensional graviton to lower dimensions. In fact from the definition of the vierbein they should have indices {Aαμ,Aβν}; recall, however, that the internal indices are raised and lowered by δαβ and δαβ in the weak field approximation. The amplitude is

[formula]

where εμαενβ are vector polarization tensors of the two gauge bosons (includes internal index as well). These can be decomposed as

[formula]

when we adopt the KLT formalism. We intend to explore implications of T-duality on this amplitude ([\ref=fourpt]). The two tachyon vertex operators are unaffected by T-duality transformation as argued earlier because these are plane waves eik.X. We also know how to convert [formula] in the exponential appearing in ([\ref=vectklt]) to O(d,d) vector. A careful inspection shows that the internal vector [formula] needs an other partner and presence of this can be justified from an old result [\cite=ms]. It was shown by us that the d vector potentials, associated with the isometries, which arise from compactification of graviton, combine with another d vector potentials coming from compactification of B̂-field to constitute a double which transform as O(d,d) vector as W is also such a vector. To be more precise, A(1)αmu and A(2)μα  =  B̂μα + BαβA(1)βμ form an O(d,d) and these together have 2d components which transform as O(d,d) vector. However, our argument that follows, is not affected even if we incorporate these subtleties. Therefore, incorporating the above argument we see that an amplitude describing scattering of a tachyon with a gravi-photon under the T-duality transformation will give us an amplitude which describes scattering of gravi-photon on a tachyon going to tachyon and admixture of gravi-photon and axi-photon in the final state. The gauge boson coming from compactification of B̂-field is termed as axi-photon. It is important to recall that Sen [\cite=senoddlr] [\cite=hassen] proposed [formula] transformation to generate new backgrounds from initial ones in the context of black holes. In fact his proposal can be implemented very elegantly when we look at the KLT prescription for strings with compact dimensions since one transformation is O(d)L and the other one is O(d)R. To complete this section, we note that we have set up formalism for the three point functions involving three scalar gravitons as well as one for one excited massive (scalar) state and two scalar gravitons in the weak field approximation. The T-duality can be implemented on scalar gravitons utilizing our formalism. We have shown that the modified version of KLT formalism has certain advantage over my earlier prescriptions. Moreover, the new formulation is better suited for studying T-duality transformation on appropriate scattering amplitudes.

Summary and Discussions

Our goal in this paper is to study scattering of close string states which arise due to compactification to lower spacetime dimension and explore the consequences of T-duality symmetry. In order to envisage scattering in string theory, in the first quantized formulation, we have to adopt an approximation scheme. The accepted procedure is to construct vertex operators which are (1,0) and (0,1) primary with respect to T+  + and T-  - respectively. Then one writes down the N-point function following the standard prescriptions. However, when we desire to study the duality transformation properties of the scattering amplitudes for the states arising out of compactifications, we have to evolve a strategy. I have proposed a procedure to construct suitably modified vertex operators so that we can implement duality transformations on them. This is one of the main results of this investigation. The basic point to recognize is that the backgrounds which arise after compactification, let us focus on massless scalars for definiteness, get transformed under T-duality. Moreover, it is convenient to combine these backgrounds to define the M-matrix as is well known. In the weak field approximation, for we need to adopt a suitable scheme, we have recalled how the backgrounds are expanded. Therefore, we should adopt a similar prescription for the M-matrix in the weak field approximation. To recall the case of 'metric' Gαβ, we express it as Gαβ  =  δαβ + hαβ. Similarly, we adopt a scheme where we expand, [formula]. We also noted that [formula] is not an O(d,d) matrix. Therefore, if we desire to apply T-duality transformation to generate a new amplitude starting from a given one, we have to follow the steps outlined in this article. Thus we start from an initial configurations of backgrounds and construct the M-matrix, then adopt the weak field approximation. In order to employ weak field approximation for transformed backgrounds, we should transform the M-matrix to generate the new matrix, M' and then adopt the weak field approximation. We have dealt with the technicalities involved and laid down the procedures. Moreover, we presented a simple example for T2 compactification and showed that starting from only the scalars coming from the compactification of the metric, we can generate the scalars associated with the B-field by following the steps proposed in this work. We also argued that following the arguments of [\cite=jmmass] we can implement T-duality transformation on vertex operators associated with the massive scalars. We have found that the prescriptions of [\cite=klt] are quite efficient and elegant to construct T-duality invariant vertex operators and implementation of duality transformation becomes quite transparent. Moreover, we have studied a four point function where a gauge boson scatters with a tachyon. The closed string gauge boson, we termed it as gravi-photon, arises from compactification of the [formula]-dimensional metric. We argued that under T-duality this scattering amplitude can be related to an amplitude where the final state is an admixture of gravi-photon and axi-photon the latter arises from compactification of the B-field. I feel that the present investigation is another application of the T-duality symmetry in the context of scattering of stringy states. Let us discuss a few possible applications of the present work. In recent years, there have been interests in the study of massive excited states in string theory [\cite=heavy1] [\cite=heavy2] [\cite=heavy3] [\cite=heavy4] [\cite=heavy5] [\cite=heavy6]. Highly excited massive states have exponential degeneracy and if these states have high enough mass they can be identified with the stringy black holes. Such states have attracted a lot of attention from diverse perspectives. It is also well known that, in certain string theoretic models where some extra compact dimensions are permitted to be large. There is the prospect experimentally observing these stringy states in currently operational accelerator like LHC [\cite=larger1] [\cite=larger2]. In my opinion some of these studies might lead to interesting result if T-duality is incorporated as an additional ingredient. We have also proposed that vertex operators of massive stringy states of NSR string can be expressed in T-duality invariant form. However, we succeeded in the case of massive levels in the NS-NS sector. The present work can be extended to NS-NS sector of superstring. Some of these investigations are underway and these will be presented in future.
