Paperfolding infinite products and the gamma function

Introduction

Unexpected explicit values for infinite series or infinite products are somehow fascinating. One of the most famous examples is the celebrated tour de force of Euler addressing the Basel (or Mengoli) problem and finding the closed form

[formula]

This formula is indeed unexpected: how could we guess that the square of the area of a circle with radius 1 would be occurring here? Of course this suggests looking at the more general sums [formula]: we know that Euler himself gave their values (also unexpected) for k an even integer, while the case where k is odd is still largely open, even after Apéry's proof of the irrationality of ζ(3) (see [\cite=vdp]), Ball-Rivoal's proof that infinitely many ζ(k) with k odd are irrational [\cite=BR] [\cite=Rivoal], and Zudilin's proof that at least one of the reals ζ(5),ζ(7),ζ(9),ζ(11) is irrational [\cite=Zudilin].

Another classical closed formula, which also looks intriguing at first sight, is the infinite product discovered by Wallis about 80 years before Euler's result, namely

[formula]

Again there is no immediate intuition why π should occur when multiplying the even numbers twice and dividing by the odd numbers twice.

Much less famous, but unexpected as well, is the Woods-Robbins infinite product [\cite=Woods] [\cite=Robbins]. Define s(n) to be the sum of the binary digits of the integer n, and consider the sequence ( - 1)s(n). In other words mn  =  ( - 1)s(n) can be defined by

[formula]

This sequence is known as the (Prouhet-)Thue-Morse sequence, and its first terms are [formula] Then

[formula]

More general products of the form [formula] where (un)n  ≥  0 is a sequence with "regularity properties", and R(n) is an ad hoc rational function can be looked at. Among possible sequences (un)n  ≥  0, one can think of automatic sequences: a sequence (un)n  ≥  0 is q-automatic for some integer q  ≥  2 if its q-kernel, i.e., the set of subsequences {(uqkn  +  j)n  ≥  0, k  ≥  0, j∈[0,qk  -  1]} is finite (see, e.g., [\cite=AS] to read more on automatic sequences). While finding closed forms of [formula] where (un)n  ≥  0 is any automatic sequence seems out of reach, closed forms for particular 2-automatic sequences were found (see, e.g., [\cite=AllCohen] [\cite=ASlms] [\cite=AllSon] [\cite=LouPro]). These are typically sequences (( - 1)wn)n  ≥  0 where wn counts the number of occurrences of some pattern in the binary expansion of n: for example the Thue-Morse sequence (( - 1)s(n))n  ≥  0 (the sum of the binary digits of n is also the number of 1's in the binary expansion of n). Another classical, but totally different, 2-automatic sequence is the regular ±  1 paperfolding sequence εn which is obtained by iteratively folding a rectangular piece of paper, see, e.g., [\cite=AS]. The regular paperfolding sequence can be defined by

[formula]

If we try to mimic one proof (see [\cite=ubiq]) of Equality ([\ref=TM]) above, we can proceed as follows. Let A and B be the two infinite products (they are convergent as will be seen in Proposition [\ref=conv] below) defined by

[formula]

Multiplying these two products, we can write

[formula]

Splitting the product on the right into odd and even indexes, we thus have

[formula]

Since the last product is A (≠  0), we have

[formula]

Using classical results on the gamma function (Proposition [\ref=ww] below and the reflection formula) we obtain

[formula]

The purpose of this paper is to show how to obtain closed forms for certain infinite products [formula], where R(n) belongs to some families of rational functions. These closed forms involve, as in Equality ([\ref=PP]), values of the Γ function (and of trigonometric functions).

Two premiminary results

In this section we give three preliminary results. The first two are classical.

Let d be a positive integer. Let (ai)1  ≤  i  ≤  d and (bj)1  ≤  j  ≤  d be complex numbers such that no ai and no bj belongs to [formula]. If [formula], then

[formula]

The Gamma function satisfies the "reflection formula" and the "duplication formula" respectively given by

[formula]

The third result that we need is the asymptotic behavior of the summatory function of the (regular) ±  1 paperfolding sequence and an application to the convergence of certain series.

Let (εn)n  ≥  0 be the ±  1 paperfolding sequence.

We have the upper bound

[formula]

Let f be a map from [formula] to [formula] such that, when x tends to infinity, f(x) tends to zero and |f(x + 1)  -  f(x)|  =  O(1 / xa) for some a  >  1. Then the series [formula] is convergent.

Proof.

(i) Let [formula]. Looking at S(2n) and splitting the sum into even and odd indexes yields

[formula]

Let us prove that for all n  ≥  1 we have |S(n)|  ≤  1  +   log 2(n) (where log 2 is the base 2 logarithm). Since S(1)  =  ε0  =  1  =  1 +  log 21, it suffices to prove that if the inequality is true for n, then it is true for both 2n and 2n + 1. (Hint: this implies by induction on N that, if the property is true on

[formula]

.) Equality ([\ref=S2n]) above implies

[formula]

(ii) This is an immediate consequence of (i) by Abel summation.   [formula]

A general product involving the paperfolding sequence

We give here a general result, involving the ±  1 paperfolding sequence. (We use the notation [formula] for the set of non-negative real numbers and [formula] for the set of positive real numbers.)

Let g be a map from [formula] to [formula] such that, when x tends to infinity, g(x) tends to 1 and g(x + 1) / g(x)  =  1  +  O(1 / xa) for some a  >  1. Then

[formula]

Proof.   Convergence of the infinite products results from Proposition [\ref=conv] (ii) with f  =   log g. We then write

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Taking [formula] defined by [formula] if x  >  0 and g(0)  =  1, and using Propositions [\ref=ww] and [\ref=gamma-rel], we obtain Equality ([\ref=PP]) of the introduction:

[formula]

Using a classical result on elliptic integrals (see, e.g., [\cite=ChSe]), it is amusing though anecdotical to note that

[formula]

Paperfolding infinite products and the gamma function

In this section we give applications of Lemma [\ref=general] above to finding closed-form expressions for "simple" infinite products involving the paperfolding sequence.

Let b be a positive real number. We have the following expression.

[formula]

Proof.   Apply Lemma [\ref=general] with [formula] and Propositions [\ref=ww] and [\ref=gamma-rel].   [formula]

Taking b = 2 (resp. b = 3) in Theorem [\ref=gamma-simple] above, we obtain

[formula]

A totally unexpected relation can be obtained from Theorem [\ref=gamma-simple] above with [formula] and from Relation (14) in the paper [\cite=Blagouchine] of Blagouchine

[formula]

Taking a nonnegative integer k, and replacing b by [formula] in Theorem [\ref=gamma-simple] above, we get

[formula]

By multiplying together these formulas for consecutive values of k, we can obtain a closed formula for the infinite products [formula] (where k and [formula] are nonnegative integers with [formula], and where b is a positive real)

[formula]

Thus, by replacing in [formula] the quantity [formula] by c, we have a closed form formula for the infinite product Uj(c), defined by (where j is a nonnegative integer, and where c is a real [formula])

[formula]

An example of an infinite paperfolding product obtained with Remark [\ref=k-ell] is

[formula]

Namely

[formula]

We do not know how to characterize the positive integers u,v,w for which the infinite product [formula] can be expressed in a closed form (also see Remark [\ref=do-not-know]).

We can give a more symmetric expression which will have the advantage of yielding "gamma-free" values of paperfolding infinite products.

Let b and c be two positive real numbers. Then

[formula]

Proof.   Apply Theorem [\ref=gamma-simple] for b and c and compute the quotient.   [formula]

Another possibly anecdotal remark is that the right side of the equality in Theorem [\ref=gamma] above can be seen as a coefficient in a connection formula for algebraic hypergeometric functions (see, e.g., [\cite=Erdelyi]; also see [\cite=Kato1] [\cite=Kato2]): with the notation of [\cite=Kato1], [formula], we have

[formula]

"Gamma-free" paperfolding products

In this section we describe "gamma-free" paperfolding infinite products, i.e., products where the gamma function "does not appear explicitly". We begin with a "trigonometric" corollary of Theorem [\ref=gamma] above.

(i) Let b be a real number in (0,2). Then

[formula]

(ii) Let k be an integer ≥  3. Then

[formula]

Proof.   Relation (i) is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=gamma] above with c  =  2 - b, and of the reflection formula Γ(z)Γ(1 - z) = π  /   sin (πz) (Proposition [\ref=gamma-rel] above). The first two relations in (ii) are obtained from (i) by taking b  =  (k - 1) / k and b  =  (k - 2) / k; multiplying them together gives the last relation.   [formula]

Relations obtained for some particular values of b or of k are of interest. In particular it has been known since Lambert (see [\cite=Lambert]; or see, e.g., [\cite=Garibaldi]) that trigonometric functions at angles whose values in degrees are [formula] can be written using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and (possibly nested) square roots, of rational numbers. Using these expressions in (i) and then in (ii) yields, e.g., the following paperfolding infinite products.

For [formula] we obtain

[formula]

For [formula] we obtain

[formula]

For [formula] we obtain

[formula]

For k = 3 we obtain

[formula]

For k = 5 we obtain

[formula]

One may ask whether it is possible to find other cases of "gamma-free" paperfolding products. In particular the so-called "short gamma products" may give paperfolding products where the gamma function does not occur explicitly. Results on short gamma products are due to Sándor and Tóth [\cite=ST] and to Nijenhuis [\cite=Nijenhuis], while "isolated" examples can be found in the literature (see the paper of Borwein and Zucker [\cite=BZ]; also see [\cite=Nijenhuis]). Before stating these results we give some notation: φ is the Euler function; the set Φ(m) is the set of integers in

[formula]

Γ() =

Γ() = 2 π.

Arithmetical nature of the paperfolding products

So far trying to give closed-form expressions for infinite products of the type [formula] where (un)n  ≥  0 is some automatic sequence, is possible when un  =  ( - 1)wn (where wn counts the number of occurrences of some pattern in the binary expansion of n) as recalled in the introduction, or, as done above, when un  =  εn is the ±  1 paperfolding sequence. But the choice for the corresponding R(n)'s is in both cases drastically limited. This does not apply to the case where un  =  1 for all n; see Proposition [\ref=ww] where the only limitation is that the infinite product converges.

A partly related question is the arithmetical nature of these infinite products: when are they algebraic, and where are they transcendental? The question is certainly not easy, even when we have a closed-form expression. In the examples above, we know that:

all infinite products given in Corollary [\ref=tangent] (i) for b rational, and in Corollary [\ref=tangent] (ii) are algebraic;

both products in Theorem [\ref=sporadic-appl] are algebraic;

the two examples of products following Theorem [\ref=gamma-simple] as well as the example following Remark [\ref=k-ell] are transcendental from a result of udnovs'ki (see [\cite=Cudnovskii]; also see, e.g., [\cite=Waldschmidt]) stating that the numbers Γ(1 / 4) and π are algebraically independent;

In order to prove the transcendence of the infinite product (as previously (εn)n is the paperfolding sequence) [formula], we do not need the full strength of udnovs'ki's result: it suffices to use, e.g., [\cite=BT]: the transcendence of [formula] can be proved by relating this constant to a nonzero period of the Weierstrass P-function, i.e., of the elliptic curve y2  =  4x3  -  4x.

We would like to cite two such problems in this section: the nature of a very particular product on one hand, and a hard general problem on the other hand.

The Flajolet-Martin constant

In a 1985 paper [\cite=FM] Flajolet and Martin came across the following constant

[formula]

where γ is the Euler constant and, as in the introduction, s(n) is the sum of the binary digits of n. It is easily proven that [formula], where

[formula]

This product resembles the (algebraic) Woods-Robbins product quoted in the introduction very much and it is not extraordinarily different from the third example (transcendental) given after Remark [\ref=k-ell], respectively

[formula]

But not only we do not know any closed-form expression for the infinite product Q, but also we do not know its arithmetical nature, nor the arithmetical nature of the Flajolet-Martin constant.

In the same spirit, looking at the infinite products A and B given in the introduction

[formula]

we do not know any closed-form formula for A, nor whether this is a transcendental or algebraic number.

The Rohrlich and Rohrlich-Lang conjectures

A strong conjecture known as the Rohrlich conjecture predicts that the algebraicity of any products and quotients of normalized gamma values (the normalized gamma function is [formula]) must derive from the properties Γ(x + 1) = Γ(x), the reflection formula and the multiplication formula for Γ (see, e.g., [\cite=Lang] or [\cite=Waldschmidt]). An explicit formulation is given, e.g., in [\cite=RR]:

Let [formula] be rational numbers that are not in [formula]. Let D be a common denominator of the ai's. Then the product [formula] is an algebraic multiple of πr / 2 if and only if for all [formula] relatively prime to D we have [formula], where {x} denotes the fractional part of the real x.

There is an even stronger conjecture, known as the Rohrlich-Lang conjecture. The interested reader can look, e.g., at [\cite=Waldschmidt].

The Rohrlich conjecture implies a criterion for the algebraicity of the infinite products in Theorem [\ref=gamma]. We first need an easy lemma.

Let {x} denote the fractional part of the real number x. Then we have

[formula]

Proof.   Left to the reader.   [formula]

Let b be a positive rational number with denominator a such that b / 4 is not an integer. Then, under the conjecture of Rohrlich, we have that the infinite product

[formula]

is algebraic if and only if for all [formula] such that m is relatively prime to 4a we have either ({mb / 4}  <  1 / 2 and {m / 4}  ≤  1 / 2) or ({mb / 4}  ≥  1 / 2 and {m / 4}  >  1 / 2). In other words this condition is equivalent to saying that for all [formula] and relatively prime to a we have {mb / 4}  <  1 / 2, and for all [formula] and relatively prime to a we have {mb / 4}  ≥  1 / 2.

Let b and c be positive rational numbers with common denominator a. We also suppose that neither b / 4 nor (c - 2) / 4 are integers. Then, under the conjecture of Rohrlich, we have that the infinite product

[formula]

is algebraic if and only if for all [formula] such that m is relatively prime to 4a we have either ({mb / 4}  <  1 / 2 and {mc / 4}  ≤  1 / 2) or ({mb / 4}  ≥  1 / 2 and {mc / 4}  >  1 / 2).

Proof.

Since Assertion (i) is the particular case c = 1 of Assertion (ii), it suffices to prove (ii). Applying Theorem [\ref=gamma] and the reflection formula for the gamma function, we have

[formula]

Since b and c are rational, the product [formula] is algebraic. Hence A(b,c) is algebraic if and only if the quantity

[formula]

is algebraic (recall the conditions on b and c). Under the conjecture of Rohrlich, we thus see that A(b,c) is algebraic if and only if for all [formula] which is relatively prime to 4a we have

[formula]

Since m is relatively prime to 4a, m must be odd, thus the condition becomes

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=fractional] this is equivalent to

[formula]

Conclusion

The quest for closed-form values is teasing but endless. Since we focussed on the (regular) paperfolding sequence here, we would like to cite here a result (due to von Haeseler in the case s = 1, see [\cite=AS]):

[formula]

Note that this result can also be obtained from an additive version of Lemma [\ref=general].
