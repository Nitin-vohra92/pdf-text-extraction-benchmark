Multi-Objective Design Optimization of the Leg Mechanism for a Piping Inspection Robot

INTRODUCTION

In a nuclear power plant, there are many places that the human workers cannot reach due to the high level of irradiation (which can be deadly). However, for safety reasons inherent to a nuclear power plant, the pipe-line equipments (which are large in such a plant) require periodic and rigorous inspections. In this context, the development of robotic system suitable to finding and to repaire a failure in such an environment is essential. It is for this reason, since many years, numerous articles appeared on this subject. In [\cite=Taguchi], the key issues raised by the design and the control of a piping inspection robot are presented. More generally, in the field of pipe inspections, four following major issues have to be faced: 1) how to move in a pipe; 2) how to locate in a pipe; 3) how to inspect a pipe area; 4) how to repair a default. Let us note that the work presented in our paper only deals with the first issue which falls within the locomotion issue. To achieve locomotion in such highly constrained pipe environment, we can classify the robot designs in two categories depending whether one takes inspiration from animals living in narrow spaces or from engineering knowledge and nine associated subcategories [\cite=Kassim2006a]. In the first category, we can imagine designs inspired from the earthworms [\cite=Drapier1961], the snakes [\cite=Ikuta], the millipedes [\cite=Utsugi1979], the Lizards [\cite=Treat1997] and even from soft animals as the octopus [\cite=Ginsburgh1988]. For the second one, we find designs based on the using of wheels and pulleys [\cite=Takada1996], the telescopic [\cite=Masuda], the impact [\cite=Hyun2001] and the natural peristalsis [\cite=Iddan1997]. The main problem of all these solutions is that each designed robot has a specific architecture for a given specification which is different in each case. Thus it is difficult to find the best architecture that responds to an user request. Despite this fact, the common denominators of all these systems are the mechanisms to adapt the contact points of the robot on the pipe surface and those to generate the expected contact forces required by the desired motion in the pipe. It is in this context that this paper takes place. Thus, the aim of the paper is to design a mechanism able to adapt the contacts on the inner surface of a pipe under constraints inherent to the environment. More precisely, before defining the complete architecture of our piping robot, we want to find by an optimization into a mechanism selection, the best design minimizing the bulk volume of the robot and maximizing the transmission factor between the embedded motor and the contact points. To simplify, in this article, we call now such a system : the legs such as they are depicted in figure [\ref=fig:robot_pipe]. In the context of our study, the considered pipe has a variable diameter between 28 mm and 58 mm with bends.

The outline of the paper is as follows. The mechanisms that we use to make the legs of our piping inspection robot are presented in first section. Then, the objective functions and the constraints on the design parameters are introduced. In section three, the optimization results under the form of Pareto fronts are presented. Moreover, CAD models of candidate mechanisms are shown. Finally, the article ends with a discussion and concluding remarks.

Locomotion and environment

The locomotion can be obtained either by putting actuated wheels or by varying the body length while the front and the rear part are alternately fixed to the pipe, the way worms do. These examples come from the classification made in [\cite=Roh2005] where seven categories of locomotion types as (i) the pig [\cite=Okamoto1999], (ii), the wheel [\cite=Choi2007], (iii) the crawler [\cite=Kwon2012], (iv) the wall press [\cite=Tsuruta2000], (v) the walking [\cite=Phee2000], (vi) the inchworm [\cite=Ono2010] and (vii) the screw type [\cite=Horodinca2002]. However, it is a well-known that the locomotion can be achieved in different ways according to the type of pipe: the wheels for the straight lines and the earthworms for the bends.

Before presenting the retained mechanisms, let us introduce some notations. Its inner radius of the pipe r varies between rmin and rmax with rmin = 14 mm and rmax = 29 mm.The minimum value is fixed in such a way that the robot can embedded a motor, electric and energy. Moreover, we define a reference frame whose the axis of motion, denoted by x, is along the main pipe axis and the motion of the mechanism under study is along the radius axis (Figure [\ref=fig:robot_pipe]).

Geometric variations of piping

Park [\cite=Park2011] lists a five principal geometric variations of piping. There are variations of (a) diameter, (b) curvature, and (c) inclination, (d) branched pipe, and (e) uneven inner surface. A pipe section can combine several geometric variations. For example we can have an inclined branched pipe with uneven inner surface. The variations of curvature limit the size of the robot when it negotiates the elbow [\cite=Choi2007]. There are four parameters to determine the size of the robot ([\ref=eq:elbow0pts]). The pipe have two parameters with the radius of piping rp and the curvature rc. The robot is defined in a cylinder with a diameter dr and length lr.

[formula]

So we choice a cylinder with a diameter of dr = 30mm and a length of lr = 60mm because the minus radius of curvature is rc = 45 mm and radius of piping rp = 20 mm.

Selection architectures of mechanism

We have selected two locomotion types, the inchworms . Then we have selected compatible mechanisms of locomotion types and geometric variations of piping. The three architectures of mechanism selected is a slot-follower mechanism [\cite=Valdastri2009] [\cite=Kim2002] [\cite=Quirini2007], a crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars [\cite=Roh2005] and 6 bars [\cite=Okada1987]. Several mechanism have been removed. the solutions of Kawaguchi [\cite=Kawaguchi1965] have proposed magnetic wheels but the environment is nonmagnetic. Dertien [\cite=Dertien2011] have built the Pirate robot for diameter range between 63 mm to 125 mm but the robot cannot be miniaturized and climb vertical pipe. Suzumori [\cite=Suzumori1999] have designed a micro inspection robot for recover an object in a 25 mm pipe, but drive system [\cite=Miyagawa2007] is limited a small pipe diameter variation. Anthierens's thesis [\cite=Anthierens] [\cite=Anthierens2000a] focuses on an inchworms locomotion in steam generator but variations and curvatures of diameter are not possible.

A slot-follower mechanism, a crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars and 6 bars

From the literature review, we have selected three architectures of mechanism suitable to be used according to the size of the pipe. For the three mechanisms, O is the origin of the reference frame, P(x,y) is the coordinate of the end-effector and ρ is the length of the prismatic joint OA.

Figure [\ref=fig:biellette-schemat] is a slot-follower mechanism [\cite=Valdastri2009] [\cite=Kim2002] [\cite=Quirini2007] where the fixed prismatic joint is actuated and the other joints are idle. Lengths l1 and l2 denoting the lengths of AP and OB respectively define the geometry of mechanism entirely. The serial singularities (working mode changing) occur when the points A and O are coincided. The mechanical limits occur when the points P and B are coincided.

Figure [\ref=fig:3barres-schemat] is a crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars [\cite=Roh2005] where the fixed prismatic joint is actuated and the other joints are idle. Lengths l1, l2 and l3 denoting the lengths of AB, OB and BP respectively define the geometry of mechanism entirely. The parallel singularities occur when O, B and A are aligned.

Figure [\ref=fig:6barres-schemat] is a crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars [\cite=Okada1987] where one fixed prismatic joint is actuated and the other joints are idle. To reduce the design parameter space, we have added some equalities. Lengths l1 denotes the lengths of AB and OB, lengths l2 denotes the lengths of BD and BC and lengths l3 denotes the lengths of DP and CP. These simplifications will be justified by the conclusion of the optimization of the crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars (See Section V). The parallel singularities occur when O, B and A are aligned or C, D and P are aligned.

Kinematic modeling of three mechanisms

The geometric parameters of the mechanism, l1, l2 , l3 (only 4 bars and 6 bars mechanism) and the actuator displacements ρ permit us to define the Direct Kinematics Model (DKM) to have the relation between the geometric parameters of the mechanism, the actuator displacements and the moving platform pose y. The assembly mode is chosen such that y > 0 and y > yB, where yB is the ordinate coordinate of the point B. We also add constraints to avoid the singular configurations. The limits of y is defined by ymax and ymin. Figures [\ref=fig:biellet-schemat-traje]-[\ref=fig:6barres-schemat-traje] depict the three mechanisms in their lower, upper and intermediate configurations for the assembly mode chosen in the paper. The size of the mechanism is defined by Δx.

For a slot-follower mechanism (Figure [\ref=fig:biellet-schemat-traje]), a single assembly mode exists and we have:

[formula]

The limits ymax and ymin are:

[formula]

ymin is constrained by the mechanical limits, when the points P and B are coincide and ymax is constrained by the length of l1 in vertical, when the points A and O are coincide (Figure [\ref=fig:biellet-schemat-traje]). As for a crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars (Figure [\ref=fig:3barres-schemat-traje]), two assembly modes exist and we set

[formula]

The limits ymax and ymin are:

[formula]

ymin is zero when the mechanism is in parallel singularities because the points O, B and A are aligned.

As for a crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars (Figure [\ref=fig:6barres-schemat-traje]), four assembly modes exist and we set

[formula]

with:

[formula]

The limits ymax an ymin are:

[formula]

ymax is equal l1 + l2 + l3 because the mechanism is in serial singularities when the all points are aligned in vertical. ymin is constrain by parallel singularities.

MULTI-OBJECTIVE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION

Objective functions

The multi-objective optimization problem aims to determine the optimum geometric parameters of the leg mechanism in order to minimize the size of the mechanism and to maximize the transmission factor.

[formula]

where Δx is the size of ​​the mechanism on the x axis which is directly connected with the swept volume of the mechanism. Δx is obtained by the projection onto the x-axis of any points of the mechanism during its motion. We set:

[formula]

The first limit avoids the serial singularities [\cite=chablat1998] and the second one restricts the mechanism size.

[formula]

where Fa is the actuator force along the x axis, Fw is the contact force in P along the y axis and ηf is the transmission efficiency between the two forces. Moreover, for convenience, we set the transmission efficiency as follows:

[formula]

In accordance with the definition of the transmission efficiency, for a slot-follower mechanism, we have:

[formula]

As regarding the crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars, we have:

[formula]

Finally, for a crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars, we have:

[formula]

with

[formula]

Design constraints

Due to assembly constraints, we have a set of inequalities. For a slot-follower mechanism, we have:

[formula]

For a crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars, we have:

[formula]

For a crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars, we have:

[formula]

Design Variables

Along with the above mentioned geometric parameters l1, l2 and l3 are considered as design variables, also called decision variables. As there are three leg mechanisms under study, the leg type is another design variable that has to be taken into account. Let d denote the leg type: d  =  1 stands for the slot-follower mechanism; d  =  2 stands for crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars and d  =  3 stands for the crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars. As a result, the optimization problem contains one discrete variable, i.e., d, and three continuous design variables, i.e., l1, l2, l3. Hence, the design variables vector [formula] is given by:

[formula]

Multi-objective optimization problem statement

The Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOO) for a leg mechanism can be stated as: Find the optimum design variables [formula] of leg mechanism in order to minimize the size of the mechanism and maximize the transmission factor subject to geometric constraints. Mathematically, the problem can be written as:

[formula]

[formula]

Optimization implementation

The classic approach to optimization is to calculate all possible combinations in the solution space. With five settings (l1,l2,l3,d,ρ), the computation time becomes excessive. For example, we have 12 billion combinations with 250 values for l1,l2,l3,ρ and 3 values of d. To solve the optimization problem, we use the genetic algorithm of Matlab [\cite=chablat2010]. A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. The computation time per mechanism is 2 hours with the settings:

population size: 6000;

pareto fraction: 50%;

tolerance function: 10- 4;

number of sessions per problem: 5.

To scan the solution space, the algorithm uses a population of 6000 individuals with 50% of individuals on the Pareto front. This allows the other half of the population to reach other optimal solutions. For the same reason, we execute five sessions per mechanism in order to have redundancy. To reduce the computation time, tolerance precision of the objectives functions is 10- 4. The computer use an Intel Core i5-560 at 2.67GHz with 8 Go RAM.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Based on the kinematic models introduced in section III, the multi-objective optimization problem, expressed in section IV, is solved by means MAPLE and MATLAB. MAPLE codes given the expression of the objective functions and MATLAB code provides functions for the optimization and to make filter to obtain the Pareto front. Figure [\ref=fig:Solution] depicts the Pareto front obtained after the optimization.

To allow a better understanding of the Pareto front, we made three optimizations by setting d = 1, 2, 3, i.e. the type of mechanism, as is depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:All_Solutions].

Slot-follower mechanism

From the Pareto front, we can extract three values:

optimum value of Δx  =  25.7  ~  mm with ηf = 0.35:

[formula]

optimum value of ηf = 1.25 with Δx = 32.3:

[formula]

intermediate solution Δx = 29.1 and ηf = 0.94:

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:Solution_Bielle] depicts the evolution of the design variables and Figure [\ref=fig:CAD_Bielle] the CAD model associated with the optimal value of Δx and ηf and an intermediate solution. We note that l2 = rmin. Figure [\ref=fig:Trace_Bielle] depicts the evolution of the transmission force efficiency between the lower and upper configurations of the slot-follower mechanism. The constraint g8 prevents a serial singularity. So the lever arm between points P, B and C intervenes. The value of transmission force efficiency is high for the optimum efficiency and Intermediate solutions because the length between P and B is small with l2  ≈  rmin. In contrast to the optimum size with a l2 small.

Crank and slider mechanism with 4 bars

From the Pareto front, we can extract three values:

optimum value of Δx  =  25.4mm with ηf = 0.52:

[formula]

optimum value of ηf = 0.75 with Δx  =  35.0mm:

[formula]

intermediate solution Δx  =  30.3mm and ηf = 0.65:

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:Solution_4bars] depicts the evolution of the design variables and Figure [\ref=fig:CAD_3barres] the CAD model associated with the optimal value of Δx and ηf and an intermediate solution. We note that l1 = l2 and the Pareto front is defined by:

[formula]

The Pareto front is a straight line in the design parameter space of mechanism. The size of the mechanism is proportional in the length of l1 and l2. The transmission force efficiency is proportional in the length of l3 because there is a lever arm between l1 and l3. If l1 is smaller than l3, the size of the mechanism is favoured. If l3 is smaller than l1, the transmission force efficiency is favored.

Crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars

From the Pareto front, we can extract three values:

optimum value of Δx  =  16.4mm with ηf = 0.30:

[formula]

optimum value of ηf = 0.75 with Δx  =  34.9:

[formula]

intermediate solution Δx  =  25.7mm and ηf = 0.56:

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:Solution_6bars] depicts the evolution of the design variables and Figure [\ref=fig:CAD_6barres] the CAD model associated with the optimal value of Δx and ηf and an intermediate solution.The Pareto front is defined by:

[formula]

The first line of the Pareto front is without constraint g9 and l2 = l3. The second line of the Pareto front with constraint g9 and l1 = l2. The two lines are orthogonal. If we want to maximize the transmission force efficiency, we are in the case l2 = l3 (S3a), so the ratio of the lever arm depends l1  /  l2. If we want to minimize the size of the mechanism, it is in the case l1 = l2 (S3c), so the ratio of the lever arm depends l2  /  l3.

CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we have presented a multi-objective optimization problem to design the leg mechanisms of a pipe inspection robot. Three closed loop mechanisms are candidate to be used for the locomotion of this robot. We have defined two objective functions and a set of constraint equations related to the kinematic behavior. A genetic algorithm is used to solve this problem with discrete and continuous variables. The optimization is made for each mechanism as three separate problems to explain the Pareto front obtained by the multi-objective problem resolution. We find out that the slot-follower mechanism is the best solution for a transmission force efficiency greater than 60% and the Crank and slider mechanism with 6 bars is the best for the other cases. We note that, for our constraint equations, the crank and slider mechanisms have similar performances. We select a S1a solution of slot-follower mechanism. The size of the mechanisms changes little between different solutions. The transmission force efficiency significantly changes between 60 % and 125 %. In a practical case, there will be at least 3 legs by groups. But The contact forces of legs is influenced by the cantilever between points 0, P and between two groups of legs. Similarly, dynamic phenomena are not taken into account in this paper. The transmission force efficiency is lower than for the slot-follower mechanism. Conversely, the slot-follower mechanism may be more difficult to build because of the passive prismatic and friction can reduce its efficiency. The mechanical strength of axes mechanisms may limit the transmitted power. In future works, the dynamic model with friction parameters will be used in locomotion phases to compare the efficiency of these mechanisms. Several locomotion pattern will be tested in our simulator to ensure contact between the robot and the inside surface of the pipe.
