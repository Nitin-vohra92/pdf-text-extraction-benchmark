Towards High-Fidelity Quantum Computation and Simulation on a Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuit

Introduction

Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) -- waveguide-based systems of optical elements such as beamsplitters and phase shifters that are monolithically integrated on a single chip -- enable control over the propagation and coupling of optical modes with exceptional phase stability and at the scale of tens to hundreds of waveguides. In particular, PICs fabricated using mature silicon processes have seen rapid development in recent years for optical interconnects and other classical applications [\cite=2010.vlasov.exascale] [\cite=2000.miller.optical_intercon]. Additionally, PICs have been shown to be an appealing platform for quantum optics: PIC-based experiments have demonstrated quantum simulation [\cite=2012.NPhys.Walther.photonic_quantum_sim] [\cite=2013.Crespi.Sciarrino.boson] [\cite=2010.Peruzzo.OBrien.QRW], boson sampling [\cite=2011.ACM.Aaronson.boson_sampling] [\cite=2013.Broome.White.BosSamp] [\cite=2013.Spring.Walmsley.BosSamp], linear optical quantum gates [\cite=2008.Science.OBrien.quantum_circuit] [\cite=2012.NPhoton.Obrien.Shor_photon_recycling], and the simulation of bosonic quantum walks [\cite=PhysRevLett.100.013906] [\cite=2010.Peruzzo.OBrien.QRW] [\cite=ander.PIC.2013].

One of the main impediments to quantum optics experiments on PICs has been the need to fabricate custom chips for each experiment, an expensive and time consuming process. In addition, many applications require PICs to be tuned between consecutive experiments. While some experiments have shown on-chip reconfigurability [\cite=Matthews:2009uo] [\cite=2014.peruzzo.obrien.eigenvalue] [\cite=2012.shadbolt.obrien.source], there has been to date no analysis of a fully reconfigurable PIC that can implement arbitrary circuits. Additionally, PIC-based experiments to date have suffered from reduced fidelity due to variations and imperfections in the fabrication process.

In this work, we propose and analyze the design of a reconfigurable quantum photonic processor (QPP) -- achievable with existing, mature silicon processes -- that overcomes fabrication imperfections. We demonstrate how to program arbitrary transformations into this system and, using a fabrication model with conservative assumptions on technology, demonstrate a tuning algorithm that overcomes fabrication imperfections and achieves high fidelity quantum operations. This programmable linear optics circuit would enable the rapid testing of quantum optics algorithms.

In the next section, we introduce the QPP architecture and discuss the origins of imperfections in realistic devices. Section III shows how to implement quantum gates on a QPP, quantifies the detrimental effects of fabrication errors, and then demonstrates a computationally scalable, gate-by-gate procedure that allows us to recover high-fidelity gate operation. As an example of the power of this technique, we analyze a circuit implementing a full quantum algorithm, the iterative phase estimation algorithm (IPEA), and show that gate-by-gate optimization is sufficient for high-fidelity operation of the full circuit. Next, in Section V, we propose and simulate a novel bosonic transport experiment that leverages the reconfigurability of the QPP to investigate 1000 realizations of quantum walks under a range of disorder and decoherence levels and to perform state preparation on a pair of input photons. To close, we discuss methods of extending this architecture with recent advances in integrated quantum devices.

The QPP Architecture

The proposed QPP architecture consists of a lattice of 2  ×  2 building blocks (Figure [\ref=fig:QPP](a)), each of which is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) (Figure [\ref=fig:QPP](b)) [\cite=1994.PRL.Reck-Zeilinger-Bartani.any_unitary_operator]. In the spatial mode basis, an ideal MZI applies the 2  ×  2 unitary given by where θ and φ correspond to the labels in Figure [\ref=fig:QPP](b).

In realistic integrated optical devices, photon loss, phase errors, and unbalanced beam splitters can severely impact performance. To simulate the effect of these imperfections, we consider a model for the well developed, CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, based on deep-UV photolithography [\cite=2012.Baehr-Jones.Hochberg.25GBS] [\cite=Hochberg:2013vj]. As photon loss is a primary concern in quantum optics experiments, we have chosen the lowest-loss elements available in this material system: directional couplers [\cite=mikkelsen2014dimensional] for the beamsplitters and thermo-optic phase modulators [\cite=2014.opex.harris-galland.heater].

Figs. [\ref=fig:QPP](c,d) illustrate the primary causes of non-idealities in these devices: in directional couplers, small variations in the dimensions and spacing of coupled waveguides (Fig. [\ref=fig:QPP](c)) result in varied splitting ratios, while in phase shifters, free carrier absorption in the doped silicon regions (Fig. [\ref=fig:QPP](d)) results in increased propagation loss. Our model accounts for realistic variations by using wafer-scale test results for directional couplers [\cite=mikkelsen2014dimensional] and phase shifters [\cite=2014.opex.harris-galland.heater]. Wafer-scale test data -- as opposed to single-device test data -- improves the validity of our model. We model the splitting ratios by a Gaussian distribution with a mean (standard deviation) of 50% (4.3%) [\cite=mikkelsen2014dimensional]. We assume the loss in each thermo-optic modulator is also sampled from a non-negative Gaussian distribution with a mean (standard deviation) of 5.16% (2.84%). While we vary only two phase shifters in each MZI, we include four phase shifters in the design to balance loss (see Fig. [\ref=fig:QPP](b)).

To incorporate these errors into simulations of QPP performance, we need to modify [formula]. First, to account for unbalanced splitting ratios, we make the replacement for each directional coupler, where the value of the transitivity t is chosen randomly according to the distribution above.

To incorporate losses -- if we wish the analysis to remain unitary -- it is necessary to add an additional mode for each lossy component. Then, loss is simply introduced as a beamsplitter with reflectivity equal to the loss. However, due to the block structure of the resulting matrix along with the post-selected nature of the quantum gates we simulate, we can instead work only with the 2  ×  2 sub-matrix corresponding to the waveguide modes. As such, each diagonal element in the 2  ×  2 phase-shift matrices acquires a factor of [formula], where the values of the γs are distributed according to the loss distribution given above:

High Fidelity Quantum Gates on the QPP

Individual Quantum Gates

To demonstrate linear optical quantum gates in the QPP architecture, Figs. [\ref=fig:QPP](e,f) show the post-selected linear optical CNOT gate previously implemented in a custom, static PIC [\cite=2003.obrien.branning.cnot] [\cite=2008.Science.OBrien.quantum_circuit] and the same gate programmed into a subset of the (ideal) QPP lattice, respectively. The beamsplitting ratio of each MZI in Fig. [\ref=fig:QPP](f) is given by [formula].

This gate, as well as those discussed later, uses the well known dual-rail encoding, i.e. each qubit is encoded in the photon amplitudes in a pair of modes [\cite=KLM01]. The control (target) modes are labeled c0 and c1 (t0 and t1) in the figure. The gate succeeds if and only if a single photon is detected in each pair of modes. Experimental realizations of this gate have demonstrated the promise of PICs, but imperfections in fabrication likely contributed to the reduction in gate fidelities (e.g., to 94% in Ref. [\cite=2008.Science.OBrien.quantum_circuit]). To analyze realistic performance in a QPP system, we simulated 1000 QPPs with splitting ratios and losses given by the aforementioned fabrication model. We then programmed the CNOT gate into each QPP.

To evaluate the performance of each gate, each simulation calculates the sub-matrix corresponding to the input and output computational modes:

[formula]

In simulations, the splitting ratios and losses are determined from a Monte Carlo process; these values can be experimentally determined for a real system using methods presented in [\cite=seeSI]. This sub-matrix can then be used to calculate the 4  ×  4 transform in the computational (i.e. two-qubit) basis [formula] [\cite=2011.ACM.Aaronson.boson_sampling], after post-selection. This is then compared to the ideal transformation with the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product [\cite=nielsen-chuang] [formula], where V0 is the ideal 4  ×  4 transform and V is the calculated transform. Normalization (corresponding to post-selection) is performed by scaling V and V0 such that F(V,V) = F(V0,V0) = 1.

The blue histogram in Fig. [\ref=fig:CNOT](a) shows the fidelity of the CNOT gate over the 1000 simulated QPPs, without optimal MZI tuning. These simulations yield a median fidelity of 94.52%, which is similar to experimentally reported values in custom PICs (e.g., [\cite=2011.Thompson.OBrien.review] [\cite=2008.Science.OBrien.quantum_circuit]). We then performed a nonlinear optimization [\cite=RinnooyKan_Timmer_nlopt] [\cite=Kucherenko_Sytsko_nlopt] [\cite=2014.Forthcoming.Steinbrecher.Optimization] of the MZI phase settings [\cite=QPPnote_reck] to maximize this fidelity for each instance of disorder [\cite=seeSI]. The green histogram in Fig. [\ref=fig:CNOT](a) shows the optimized QPP performance; the median fidelity improved dramatically to 99.99%.

We performed the same tuning procedure on the post-selected CPHASE gate of Ref. [\cite=kieling2010photonic], for which we observe a similar improvement in median fidelity after optimization from 92.22% to 99.99% (see Fig. [\ref=fig:CNOT](b)). These results show that post-fabrication optimization enables the reliable implementation of high-fidelity quantum logic gates on QPPs using currently realizable PICs.

Iterative Phase Estimation Algorithm

The possibility of high-fidelity operations makes the QPP architecture attractive for studying larger-scale quantum algorithms. As it is dynamically reconfigurable, it is well suited for iterative algorithms that rapidly update the circuit in response to previous measurements. Here, we examine the performance of one such algorithm, the iterative phase estimation algorithm. The IPEA is an iterative procedure used to solve for the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian, which has applications in sensing and simulation, which has applications in sensing and simulation [\cite=2012.NPhys.Walther.photonic_quantum_sim]. The IPEA maps a Hamiltonian H to a unitary propagator [formula]. In this approach, solving the eigenvalue problem [formula] is equivalent to calculating the energy levels of H. A binary expansion of λ can be calculated by adaptive and iterative bitwise measurements [\cite=2005.Science.Aspuru-Guzik.qu_sim_molecular_energy] [\cite=2011.Whitfield.Aspuru-Guzik.IPEA].

Fig. [\ref=fig:IPEA](a) shows the quantum circuit for the two qubit IPEA; as demonstrated in [\cite=Lanyon:2010jf], this is sufficient to calculate the first four energy levels of an H2 molecule over a range of atomic separations. This is achieved through the use of a basis set in which the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal with at most 2  ×  2 blocks. To simulate the performance of this system on the QPP, we decompose the controlled unitary of the IPEA into a CPHASE gate with additional single-qubit rotations. We then split the system into three sections that were optimized separately: the input single-qubit rotations, the CPHASE gate, and the output single-qubit rotations. This decomposition into individually optimized gates is useful for computational efficiency.

We find that for 10,000 simulated instances of the QPP, the unoptimized IPEA performed with a median fidelity of 82.63% (Fig. [\ref=fig:IPEA](b), blue). When using our optimized gates, the median fidelity rose to 99.77% (Fig. [\ref=fig:IPEA](b), green). While only two qubits are required for small simulations, such as an H2 molecule, more qubits are required for larger systems, motivating the development of large-scale PICs such as the QPP.

Quantum Random Walks

The programmability of the QPP also enables detailed studies of single- [\cite=PhysRev.109.1492] [\cite=segev.2007.ander] [\cite=PhysRevLett.100.013906] and multi-photon [\cite=PhysRevLett.102.253904] [\cite=2010.Peruzzo.OBrien.QRW] [\cite=PhysRevLett.105.163905] [\cite=ander.PIC.2013] [\cite=2013.Giuseppe.Saleh.Anderson] quantum random walks on a lattice with discrete, nearest-neighbor coupling. QRWs are attractive for their application to the problems of quantum simulation [\cite=2008.JCP.Mohseni.qu_sim_photosynth], database search [\cite=Childs_Goldstone_2004], and Boson Sampling [\cite=2011.ACM.Aaronson.boson_sampling].

In the discrete-time QRW, a particle with an internal binary degree of freedom (a "coin") is placed on the lattice. At each step of the walk, two operations occur: the internal state of the coin is prepared and the particle is shifted left or right (as indicated in Fig. [\ref=fig:QRW]) according to the state of the coin ("left" and/or "right"). We use a spatial encoding for both the position and the coin state of a quantum walker: position is defined at an MZI, while the coin state is defined by occupation between the two output waveguides of the MZI. The coin toss operation is controlled by the MZI splitting ratio and output phase. The MZI lattice implements a shift operation where photons in the left (right) state propagate left (right) to the next layer of the QPP. The rectangular lattice shown in Fig. 1(a) can implement such a QRW more compactly than the triangular lattice proposed in Ref. [\cite=1994.PRL.Reck-Zeilinger-Bartani.any_unitary_operator].

We studied the propagation of two indistinguishable photons on a QRW in the QPP. The path-entangled initial state is [formula], where and are the two outputs of the first MZI of the QRW, MZI1. This state is prepared in the QPP by first launching indistinguishable photons into the two waveguides of the first MZI set to (η,φ) = (0.5,π / 2), producing the desired state [formula]. The next layer of MZIs is set to (η,φ) = (1,0) and (1,0) in order to route the state to the first layer of the random walk. The state is then evolved in the following 15 MZI layers of the QPP, where all internal phases θ are set to π / 2. In these simulations, disorder is introduced by sampling the MZI output phases (φ) randomly from a uniform distribution on the interval

Discussion

We have shown that a QPP, fabricated in current silicon photonics processes, could enable high-fidelity quantum gates and quantum simulation. We focused on post-selected gates to compare this system to preceding PIC-based experiments. Looking forward, one goal of linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) systems is to achieve the error threshold necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computation [\cite=KLM01]. For post-selected LOQC, this threshold can be as high as  1% [\cite=knill2005], but with limitations on overhead (e.g., < 104 physical CNOT gates per qubit and gate), the error rate must be much lower: ~  10- 3 - 10- 4 [\cite=knill2005]. The optimization work presented above, in combination with advanced silicon processes, offers a path toward achieving these demanding error rates in the QPP architecture.

Proposed universal quantum computers based on LOQC will also require efficient single-photon sources, single-photon detectors, and feed-forward operations. There has been rapid progress integrating these elements into the silicon photonics platform; recent examples include entangled-photon sources based on four-wave mixing [\cite=2010.chen.migdal] and waveguide-integrated superconducting single-photon detectors [\cite=2013.Najafi-Mower.PIC-SNSPD] [\cite=2011.Pernice.Tang.SNSPD]. The potential for multiplexing the emission of spontaneous single-photon sources [\cite=PhysRevA.66.053805] [\cite=2011.PRA.Mower.AMPP] could enable high-efficiency state preparation for quantum computation; low-latency superconducting logic [\cite=mccaughan2014superconducting] could enable the feed-forward required for scalable LOQC; and low photon-number nonlinear elements could enable photon-photon interaction and deterministic quantum logic [\cite=PhysRevLett.111.247401] [\cite=Englund2008].

The high-dimensional transformations possible on the QPP could also enable a number of applications in classical optics, including multi-input multi-output, transparent, non-blocking switches [\cite=Yang:11] [\cite=Chen:2014el], signal routers, high-dimensional beam splitters, and large phased arrays [\cite=sun2013large], e.g., for LIDAR applications.

Conclusion

We presented a detailed analysis of the feasibility of a reconfigurable quantum photonic processor that enables high-fidelity linear optical transformations and could greatly accelerate prototyping of quantum algorithms in integrated quantum photonics. As demonstrated by our simulation of quantum walks, reconfigurability also enables a single device to perform statistically robust studies of the propagation of photons through complex optical networks. The predicted high fidelity of quantum operations under realistic fabrication defects suggests that a QPP reaching high post-selected gate fidelities is within experimental reach.
