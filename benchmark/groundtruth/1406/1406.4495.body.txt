Asymptotics of the 3j and 9j Coefficients

In this paper we focus on equations (11 and 13), and (23 and 24) of the work of Kleszyk and Zamick [\cite=Kleszyk]. In particular we consider the case when the total angular momentum I is equal to [formula] and [formula], and n = 0,1,2,... We take the limit of large j where n becomes much smaller than j. For convenience, we also define J = 2j, where j is the total angular momentum of a single particle.

We first address the 3j coefficient, using the formula Eq. (13) of [\cite=Kleszyk], a derivation of which is contained in the work of Racah [\cite=Racah]:

[formula]

We express the total angular momentum I using a new variable m such that I = 4j - 2m, where this time m = 1,2,3,.... We can separate parts of the 3j which now becomes

[formula]

where the 6 factors Ni are:

[formula]

We use the Stirling approximation,

[formula]

and it should be noted that the approximation approaches the true value asymptotically. Now we can write: Ni = (αi  +  βim + γiJ) with differing constant coefficients. In Eq.[\eqref=eq:defN] we give the contribuition of [formula] and γJ ln N. For the latter we break things up into (a) "extreme" and (b) "next order". This is necessary because "next order" has contributions comparable to those in "- N".

First notice that "γJ ln N" result is [formula], which cancels the [formula] from "- N". Adding up all the totals we get

[formula]

[formula]

Taking the antilog we get

[formula]

and note that [formula].

Putting everything together and putting things in terms of j and n we obtain

[formula]

We see that in the limit n  ≪  j, 3j goes as [formula]. Alternatively the Clebsch-Gordan has an asymptotic value

[formula]

We next consider the unitary 9j coefficient 〈(jj)2j(jj)2j|(jj)2j(jj)2j - 2〉I. Again we will write I = 4j - 2m, with m = 1,2,3,.... In Eq. (11) from [\cite=Kleszyk], we have a factor (2J + I + 1)! which becomes (4J + 1 - 2m)!. This can be written as (4J + 1)!  ×  PROD where PROD = (4J + 1)(4J)...(4J + 2 - 2m). For convenience we break this equation into several parts:

[formula]

where

[formula]

with

[formula]

There are 2m terms in PROD. We use the fact that (4J + 1 - 2m)! = (4J + 1)!  ×  PROD, and asymptotically we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

We use the Stirling approximation to calculate FAC. The detailed results are given in Table [\ref=table:u9j].

We next combine Tables 1 and 2. There are many cancellations when we add the totals of ln FAC and [formula] in Table [\ref=table:3j] and Table [\ref=table:u9j]. The result is

[formula]

The antilog is

[formula]

The j dependence comes from

[formula]

and PROD

[formula]

putting everything together we obtain the result

[formula]

In the different limit of fixed I and j  ≫  I, we get the behavior

[formula]

The best way to demonstrate the power-law behavior of the U9j symbol is to plot the logarithm of U9j vs. the logarithm of j. We plot this in Figure 1. Note the independence of the slopes of the curves for different values of n.

We present results of the percent deviation of our approximate values of 3j and U9j from the exact values in Tables 3 and 4.

We note other work on asymptotics of CG coefficients by Reinsch and Morehead [\cite=Reinsch]. In their work they define

[formula]

They find an approximate expression for the CG coeffecients in their Eq.(B9).

[formula]

[formula]

We quickly run into trouble in making a comparison with our results, especially for n = 0. In their Eq.(B12) they have in the leading term CG proportional to [formula]. However for the case j = j1 + j2, that is to say I = Imax, with our n = 0, we see that β vanishes and hence their expression for CG blows up. Evidently their formula is not valid in this region. On the other hand, our expression Eq. (13) from [\cite=Kleszyk] works just fine.

In this work, we have given the details of how the asymptotic behaviors of selected 3j and 9j coefficients and their unitary counterparts are obtained. There are some subtleties, e.g. in the second column of Table 1, although term-by-term we get non-zero results, the entire sum is zero and so we must expand further as in the following column. There are similar points for Table 2. We further note that one can take asymptotic limits in more than one way. Here the emphasis is on when the total angular momentum I is large (I = Imax - 2n,n  ≪  j), and one obtains a power-law behavior 1 / jn . This is most easily seen by plotting [formula]. On the other hand, if one keeps I fixed and increases j one gets a dominantly exponential behavior, as shown in Eq. (19).This is most easily seen by plotting U9j vs. j. Lastly, we recall the physics motivation for this work--how maximum-j pairing manifests itself in nuclei [\cite=Escuderos].
