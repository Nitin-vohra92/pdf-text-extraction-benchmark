A Subgroup Theorem for Homological Filling Functions

Introduction

The nth homological and homotopical filling functions of a space are generalized isoperimetric functions describing the minimal volume required to fill an n-cycle or n-sphere with an (n + 1)-chain or (n + 1)-ball. These functions have been widely studied in Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Group Theory; see for example [\cite=AWP] [\cite=Snowflake] [\cite=WordProc] [\cite=Ge99] [\cite=Gromov83] [\cite=MP15]. In this paper, we study the relation between the nth homological filling functions of a finitely presented group and its subgroups. Our main result provides sufficient conditions for the nth-filling function of a subgroup to be bounded from above by the nth-filling function of the ambient group. The hypotheses of our theorem are in terms of finiteness properties of the ambient group and the subgroup. Our result contrasts with known examples illustrating that this relation does not hold under weaker conditions [\cite=NonHyp] [\cite=YoungHeisenberg] [\cite=Young13].

Statement of Main Result

A K(G,1) for a group G is a cell complex X with contractible universal cover [formula] and fundamental group isomorphic to G. If G admits a K(G,1) with finite n-skeleton, then G is said to be of type Fn. Such finiteness properties are natural (topological) generalizations of being finitely generated (type F1) and finitely presented (type F2).

If X is a K(G,1) with finite (n + 1)-skeleton, then the [formula]-homological filling function of G is an optimal function [formula] such that FVn + 1G(k) bounds the minimal volume required to fill an n-cycle γ of [formula] of volume at most k, with an (n + 1)-chain μ of [formula] having boundary ∂(μ)  =  γ. See Section [\ref=sec:fvg] for precise definitions.

It can be shown that the growth rate of FVn + 1G is independent of the choice of X up to an equivalence relation ~  , hence FVn + 1G is an invariant of the group G, see [\cite=Fl98] [\cite=Young]. The relation f  ~  g between functions is defined as [formula] and [formula], where [formula] means that there is C  >  0 such that for all [formula], f(n)  ≤  Cg(Cn  +  C)  +  Cn  +  C. Our main result is a generalization of a result of Gersten [\cite=Ge92] to higher dimensions.

Let n  ≥  1. Let G be a group admitting a finite (n + 1)-dimensional K(G,1) and let H  ≤  G be a subgroup of type Fn + 1. Then

[formula]

Some examples that contrast with Theorem [\ref=SubgroupDehn] are the following. In [\cite=NonHyp], Noel Brady constructed a group G admitting a finite 3-dimensional K(G,1) such that FV2G is linear, and G contains a subgroup H  ≤  G of type F2 with FV2H at least quadratic. Another source of examples are the generalized Heisenberg groups H2n + 1, for which Robert Young computed the homological filling invariants in [\cite=YoungHeisenberg] [\cite=Young13]. For instance, H5 admits a finite 5-dimensional K(H5,1) and has quadratic FV2H5. On the other hand, H3 can be embedded in H5, admits a 3-dimensional K(H3,1), and has cubic FV2H3. Likewise, H5 has quadratic FV3H5 and can be embedded in H7 which has FV3H7 polynomial of degree 3 / 2.

Theorem [\ref=SubgroupDehn] also imposes constraints on certain well known constructions. For example, given a finitely generated group H with decidable word problem in nondeterministic polynomial time, Birget, Ol'shanskii, Rips and Sapir produce an embedding of H into a finitely presented group G with polynomial Dehn function [\cite=BORS02]. For this construction, Theorem [\ref=SubgroupDehn] implies that if H has a finite 2-dimensional K(H,1) and FV2H is not bounded by a polynomial function, then G does not admit a finite 2-dimensional K(G,1). A particular example of such a group H is the Baumslag-Solitar group B(m,n) with |m|  ≠  |n|, for which the embedding constraint is known [\cite=Ge92].

We discuss some applications of Theorem [\ref=SubgroupDehn] to hyperbolic groups and homotopical filling functions below. Recall that a group G is hyperbolic if it has a linear Dehn function. In [\cite=Ge96], Gersten proved the following:

[\cite=Ge96] Let G be a hyperbolic group of cohomological dimension 2. Then every finitely presented subgroup H  ≤  G is hyperbolic.

Gersten's result does not hold in higher dimensions as Brady has exhibited a hyperbolic group G of cohomological dimension 3 containing a non-hyperbolic finitely presented subgroup H  ≤  G [\cite=NonHyp]. We can however, obtain a result similar to Theorem [\ref=GerstenSubgroup] by considering homotopical filling functions of higher dimensions. The [formula]-homotopical filling function δnG of a group G is defined analogously to FVn + 1G but restricts to filling n-spheres with (n + 1)-balls inside the universal cover of K(G,1) with finite (n + 1)-skeleton. Roughly speaking, δnG(k) bounds the minimum volume required to fill an n-sphere of volume at most k, with an (n + 1)-ball. Precise definitions of "volume" and δnG can be found in [\cite=AWP] [\cite=Snowflake].

Let G be a hyperbolic group of geometric dimension n + 1, where n  ≥  2. Let H  ≤  G be of type Fn + 1. Then δnH is linear.

Recall that the geometric dimension of a group G is the minimum dimension among K(G,1)'s. The Eilenberg-Ganea Theorem [\cite=Brown] [\cite=EilenbergGanea] states that the cohomological and geometric dimensions of a group G are equal for dimensions greater or equal than 3. This justifies our use of geometric dimension in the corollary above. In addition to Corollary [\ref=GerstenHigherDimension], we have the following homotopical version of Theorem [\ref=SubgroupDehn] for sufficiently large n.

Let n  ≥  3. Let G be a group admitting a finite (n + 1)-dimensional K(G,1). Let H  ≤  G be of type Fn + 1. Then [formula].

Corollaries [\ref=GerstenHigherDimension] and [\ref=HomotopicalMain] follow from Theorem [\ref=SubgroupDehn] and the following results:

[\cite=ABDY] For n  ≥  3, the [formula]-homotopical and homological filling functions δnG and FVn + 1G are equivalent. For [formula].

[\cite=Lang] Let G be a hyperbolic group. Then FVn + 1G is linear for all n  ≥  1.

A theorem of Rips imples that G admits a compact K(G,1), see [\cite=GH90] and then the Eilenberg-Ganea Theorem implies that G admits a compact (n + 1)-dimensional K(G,1), see [\cite=Brown]. Theorems [\ref=SubgroupDehn] and [\ref=ThmLang] imply that FVn + 1H is linear. It then follows from Theorem [\ref=HomotopicalHomological] that δnH is also linear.

Apply Theorems [\ref=HomotopicalHomological] and [\ref=SubgroupDehn].

Corollary [\ref=GerstenHigherDimension] does not apply to Brady's example H  ≤  G mentioned above since H is not of type F3. It is an open question whether or not the subgroups H in Corollary [\ref=GerstenHigherDimension] are in fact hyperbolic.

It is an open question whether or not the statement of Corollary [\ref=HomotopicalMain] holds for n  =  1 or 2. In general [formula] and [formula], examples of such groups are given in [\cite=ABDY] [\cite=Young].

Filling Norms on [formula]-Modules

In this section we define the notion of a filling-norm on a finitely generated [formula]-module. Most ideas in this section are based on the work of Gersten in [\cite=Ge96]. The section contains four lemmas on which the proof of the main result of the paper relies on.

A norm on an Abelian group A is a function [formula] satisfying the following conditions:

[formula] with equality if and only if a  =  0, and

[formula].

If, in addition, the norm satisfies

[formula], for [formula],

then it is called a regular norm.

If A is free Abelian with basis X, then X induces a regular [formula]-norm on A given by [formula], where [formula].

Two norms [formula] and [formula] on a [formula]-module M are linearly equivalent if there exists a fixed constant C  >  0 such that

[formula]

for all m∈M. This is an equivalence relation and the equivalence class of a norm [formula] is called the linear equivalence class of [formula].

Suppose G is a group and F is a free [formula]-module with [formula]basis [formula]. Then [formula] is a free [formula]-basis for F as a (free) [formula]-module. This free [formula]-basis induces a G-equivariant [formula]-norm [formula] on F. We call a free [formula]module based if it is understood to have a fixed basis, and we use this basis for the induced [formula]-norm [formula].

Let η:F  →  M be a surjective homomorphism of [formula]-modules and suppose that F is free, finitely generated, and based. The filling norm on M induced by η and the free [formula]-basis of F is defined as

[formula]

Observe that this norm is G-equivariant.

Gersten observed that filling norms are not in general regular norms. He illustrated this fact with the following example [\cite=Ge96-2]. Let X be the universal cover of the standard complex of the group presentation 〈x|x2,x2k〉, where k  ≥  2. The filling norm on the integral cellular 1-cycles Z1(X) induced by [formula] is not regular since [formula].

If F is a finitely generated based free [formula]-module, then the [formula]-norm induced by a free [formula]-basis is a filling norm.

The following lemma is reminiscent of the fact that linear operators on finite dimensional normed spaces are bounded.

[\cite=Ge96] Let φ:F  →  F' be a homomorphism between finitely generated, free, based [formula]modules. Let [formula] and [formula] denote the induced [formula]-norms of F and F'. Then there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all x∈F

[formula]

Let [formula] be the [formula]basis of F inducing the norm [formula]. Then φ is given by a finite n  ×  m matrix whose entries are elements of [formula]. Observe that for any g∈G, x∈F, we have [formula]. Define [formula] and let x∈F be arbitrary. Then

[formula]

Let φ:P  →  Q be a homomorphism between finitely generated [formula]modules. Let [formula] and [formula] denote filling norms on P and Q respectively. If P is projective then there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all p∈P

[formula]

Consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

constructed as follows. Let A and B be finitely generated and based free [formula]-modules, and let A  →  P and B  →  Q be surjective morphisms inducing the filling norms [formula] and [formula]. Since P is projective and B  →  Q is surjective, there is a lifting ψ:P  →  B of φ; then let [formula] be the composition [formula]. Let C be the constant provided by Lemma [\ref=EquivFree] for [formula]. Let p∈P and let a∈A that maps to p. It follows that

[formula]

Since the above inequality holds for any a∈A with ρ(a) = p, it follows that

[formula]

[\cite=Ge96] Any two filling norms on a finitely generated [formula]-module M are linearly equivalent.

Consider a pair of surjective homomorphisms of [formula]modules η:F  →  M and η':F'  →  M such that F and F' are finitely generated, free, based modules inducing the filling norms [formula] and [formula] on M. Since η' is surjective, the universal property of F provides a homomorphism φ such that [formula]. Let m∈M be arbitrary and take x∈F such that η(x)  =  m. Since [formula], by Lemma [\ref=EquivFree] there exists C  >  0 such that

[formula]

As this inequality holds for all x∈F satisfying η(x)  =  m, we have

[formula]

The other inequality proceeds in a similar manner.

[\cite=Ge96] Let [formula] be a short exact sequence of [formula]modules where

M is finitely generated and equipped with a filling-norm [formula].

N is free, based, and equipped with the induced [formula]-norm [formula].

P is projective.

Then there exists a retraction ρ:N  →  M for the inclusion ι:M  →  N and a fixed constant C  >  0 such that [formula] for all x∈N.

Since P is projective there is a retraction ρ' for ι. Since M is finitely generated, N is isomorphic to a product [formula] of free modules where I is finitely generated and contains the image of M. Define ρ:N  →  M by ρ|I  =  ρ'|I and ρ|Q  =  0. Then ρ is a retraction for ι with support contained in I.

Each x∈N has a unique decomposition x  =  y  +  q where y∈I, q∈Q such that ρ(x)  =  ρ(y) and [formula]. Apply Lemma [\ref=lem:ProjBounded] to the restriction ρ:I  →  M to obtain C  >  0 such that

[formula]

Homological Filling Functions of Groups

In this section, given a group G of type FPn + 1, where n  ≥  1, we define the group invariant FVn + 1G. In the first part of the section we provide an algebraic definition of FVn + 1G and prove that it is well defined. This algebraic approach, while naturally inspired by the topological approach, provides a convenient algebraic framework suitable for some of the arguments in this paper. This algebraic approach has been also explored in [\cite=JOR13]. In the second part, we recall the topological approach to FVn + 1G and show that the topological and algebraic approaches are equivalent for finitely presented groups of type FPn + 1. The final subsection discusses why FVn + 1G(k) is a finite number.

Algebraic Definition of FVn + 1G

Let f and g be functions from [formula] to [formula]. Define [formula] if there exists C  >  0 such that for all [formula]

[formula]

The functions f and g are linearly equivalent, f  ~  g, if both [formula] and [formula] hold. This is an equivalence relation and the equivalence class containing a function f is called the linear equivalence class of f.

[\cite=Brown] A group G is of type FPn if there is a resolution of [formula]-modules

[formula]

such that for each [formula] the module Pi is a finitely generated projective [formula]-module. In this case, such a resolution is called an FPn-resolution.

Let G be a group of type FPn + 1. The algebraic [formula]-filling function is the (linear equivalence class of the) function

[formula]

defined as follows. Let

[formula]

be a resolution of [formula]-modules for [formula] of type FPn + 1. Choose filling norms for Pn and Pn + 1, denoted by [formula] and [formula] respectively. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is not immediately clear that the maximum in Definition [\ref=def:algFVG] is a finite number. In Section [\ref=sec:FVGfinite] we recall some results from the literature which, under the assumption G is finitely presented, imply that FVn + 1G is a finite valued function for n = 1 and n  ≥  3. The authors are not aware of a proof for the case n = 2.

For n = 2, all results in this paper regarding FV3G hold under the following natural modifications. First, work with the standard extensions of addition, multiplication, and order, of the positive integers [formula] to [formula]. Definition [\ref=def:lin-equiv] is extended to functions [formula], but we emphasize that the constant C remains a finite positive integer. In Definition [\ref=def:algFVG] the function FV3G is defined as an [formula] function. We observe that no argument in this paper relies on FVn + 1G(k) being finite.

Let G be a group of type FPn + 1. Then the algebraic [formula]-filling function FVn + 1G of G is well defined up to linear equivalence.

Let [formula] and [formula] be a pair of resolutions of [formula]-modules of type FPn + 1 with choices of filling-norms for their [formula] and [formula] modules denoted by [formula] and [formula], and [formula] and [formula] respectively. Let [formula] and [formula] be the induced functions according to Definition [\ref=def:algFVG]. By symmetry, it is enough to show that [formula].

It is well known that any two projective resolutions of a [formula]-module are chain homotopy equivalent, see for example [\cite=Brown], and hence the resolutions [formula] and [formula] are chain homotopy equivalent. Therefore there exists chain maps fi:Fi  →  Pi, gi:Pi  →  Fi, and a map hi:Fi  →  Fi + 1 such that

[formula]

Let C denote the maximum of the constants for the maps gn + 1, hn, and fn and the chosen filling-norms provided by Lemma [\ref=lem:ProjBounded]. We claim that for every [formula],

[formula]

Fix k. Let α∈ ker (∂n) be such that [formula]. Choose β∈Pn + 1 such that δn + 1(β)  =  fn(α) and [formula]. By commutativity of the chain maps and the chain homotopy equivalence,

[formula]

Since α∈ ker (∂n), we have that [formula]. Rearranging the above equation, we obtain

[formula]

Hence gn + 1(β)  -  hn(α) has boundary α. Observe that

[formula]

Since α was arbitrary, [formula] for all [formula]. This shows that [formula] completing the proof.

Topological Definition of FVn + 1G

For a cell complex X, the cellular chain group Ci(X) is a free Abelian group with basis the collection of all i-cells of X. This natural basis induces an [formula]-norm on Ci(X) that we denote by [formula]. Recall that a complex X is n-connected if its first n-homotopy groups are trivial.

A group G is of type Fn if there is a K(G,1)-complex with a finite n-skeleton, i.e., with only finitely many cells in dimensions ≤  n.

[\cite=Fl98] [\cite=Young] Let G be a group acting properly, cocompactly, by cellular automorphisms on an n-connected cell complex X. The topological [formula]-filling function of G is the (linear equivalence class of the) function [formula] defined as

[formula]

where

[formula]

J. Fletcher and R. Young have independently provided geometric proofs that the topological [formula]-filling function FVn + 1G is well defined as an invariant of the group, see [\cite=Fl98] and [\cite=Young] respectively. In the work of Fletcher, the topological definition of FVn + 1G requires X to be the universal cover of a K(G,1), while Young's proof is in the more general context introduced above.

[\cite=Young] Let G be a group admitting a proper and cocompact action by cellular automorphisms on an n-connected cell complex. Then the topological [formula]-filling invariant FVn + 1G of G is well defined up to linear equivalence.

Even in the topological definition, it is not trivial that FVn + 1G is a finite valued function and Remark [\ref=rem:FVGfinite] also applies in this case. For the rest of the section, we show that the topological and algebraic approaches to FVn + 1G are equivalent for finitely presented groups of type FPn + 1.

Let n  ≥  1 and let G be a group of type Fn + 1. Then G is of type FPn + 1 and the algebraic and topological [formula]-filling functions of G are linearly equivalent.

Let X be a K(G,1) with finite (n + 1)-skeleton. The G-action on the universal cover [formula] of X induces the structure of a [formula]-module to the group of cellular chains [formula] and each boundary map ∂i is a morphism of [formula]-modules. Since the G-action on [formula] is cellular and free, each [formula] is a free [formula]-module with basis any collection of representatives of the G-orbits of i-cells. Since the action is cocompact on the (n + 1)-skeleton, each [formula] is a finitely generated free [formula]-module for [formula]. Since [formula] is a contractible space, all its homology groups are trivial and therefore we have a resolution of [formula]-modules

[formula]

of type FPn + 1. Under our assumptions, the induced topological [formula]-filling function of G is a particular instance of an algebraic [formula]-filling function of G. The conclusion then follows from Theorems [\ref=AlgebraicDef] and [\ref=ThmYoung].

[\cite=Brown] Let G be finitely presented and of type FPn where n  ≥  2. Then G is of type Fn.

Propositions [\ref=prop:Fn1] and [\ref=prop:Fn11] imply the following statement.

Let G be a finitely presented group of type FPn + 1. Then the topological and algebraic definitions of FVn + 1G are equivalent.

Finiteness of FVn + 1G(k)

Let G be a finitely presented group of type FPn + 1, or equivalently assume that G is of type Fn + 1; see Proposition [\ref=prop:Fn11]. We will sketch why FVn + 1G is a finite valued function for n = 1 and n  ≥  3.

Case n = 1

Finiteness of FV2G follows from that of the Dehn function δG. We summarize the argument from Gersten's article [\cite=Ge99]. Let X be a K(G,1) with finite 2-skeleton and let [formula] be a 1-cycle with [formula]. Then [formula] for some m  ≤  k where each zi is the 1-cycle induced by a simple edge circuit γi in [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Case n  ≥  3

A group G of type Fn + 1 has a well defined invariant called the nth-homotopical filling function [formula]. There are multiple approaches to define δnG, we sketch the approach found in [\cite=ABDY] [\cite=Snowflake]. Roughly speaking, if X is a K(G,1) with finite (n + 1)-skeleton, then δnG(k) measures the number of (n + 1)-balls required to fill a sphere [formula] comprised of at most k n-balls. Here the maps [formula] and fillings [formula] are required to be in a particular class of maps called admissible maps. This allows one to define the volumes, vol(f) and vol(), as the number of n-balls and (n + 1)-balls of Sn and Dn + 1 respectively, mapping homeomorphically to open cells of [formula]. The filling volume of f is given by

[formula]

and δnG by

[formula]

Alonso et al. use higher homotopy groups as π1(X)-modules to provide a more algebraic approach to δnG, in particular they show that δnG is a finite valued function [\cite=AWP]. It is observed in [\cite=Snowflake] that Alonso's approach and the approach described above are equivalent.

The finiteness of FVn + 1G then follows from the inequality

[formula]

which holds for all n  ≥  3. We outline the argument for this inequality described in the introduction of [\cite=ABDY]. Let X be a K(G,1) with finite (n + 1)-skeleton and let [formula] with [formula]. Using the Hurewicz Theorem, one can show (see [\cite=Gromov83] [\cite=White]) that γ is the image of the fundamental class of an n-sphere for a map [formula] such that [formula]. If [formula] is an extension of f to the (n + 1)-ball Dn + 1, then the image of the fundamental class of Dn + 1 is an (n + 1)-chain μ with ∂(μ)  =  γ and [formula]. Therefore the filling volume

[formula]

is greater than or equal to the filling norm [formula]. It follows that FVn + 1G(k)  ≤  δnG(k)

Main Result

As we will be working with cell complexes, all relevant computations in this section are understood to occur within cellular chain complexes.

A [formula]-module P is stably free if there exists finitely generated free [formula] module F such that [formula] is free.

[\cite=Brown] Let G  =  π1(X,x0), where X is a cell complex. Then X is a subcomplex of a complex Y such that the inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence, and the cellular n-cycles of the universal covers [formula] and [formula] satisfy [formula] as [formula]-modules.

Let x0 be a 0-cell of X, and glue an n-cell Dn to (X,x0) by mapping its boundary to x0. The resulting space is the wedge sum of X and an n-sphere Sn. To obtain Y, attach an (n + 1)-cell Dn + 1 by the attaching map that identifies ∂Dn + 1 with the n-sphere Sn. Then [formula] where the [formula] factor is generated by a lifting of the n-cell Dn to [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a homotopy equivalence.

[\cite=Brown] Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

be exact sequences of R-modules with Pi and Pi' projective for i  ≤  n - 1. Then

[formula]

We are now ready to prove our main result which is a generalization of [\cite=Ge92]. The proof is based on Gersten's proof of [\cite=Ge96] and is adjusted for higher dimensions:

Let G be a group admitting a finite (n + 1)-dimensional K(G,1) and let H  ≤  G be a subgroup of type Fn + 1. Then [formula]

Let W be a finite (n + 1)-dimensional K(G,1). Let X be the (n + 1)-skeleton of a K(H,1). Since H is of type Fn + 1, we may assume that X is a finite cell complex. Then, after subdivisions, there exists a cellular map f:X  →  W inducing the inclusion [formula] at the level of fundamental groups. Let Mf be the mapping cylinder of f and consider the exact sequences of [formula]-modules

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denote the universal covers of W and Mf respectively.

Applying Schanuel's lemma to the above sequences shows that the [formula]module [formula] is finitely generated and stably free. Let Y be the space obtained by attaching a finite number of (n + 1)-balls to the base point of Mf as in Lemma [\ref=StdTrick] such that [formula] is finitely generated and free as a [formula]-module.

From here on, we are only concerned with the inclusion map X  →  Y realizing the inclusion H  →  G at the level of fundamental groups with the property that [formula] is finitely generated and free as a [formula]-module. Since the inclusion X  →  Y is injective at the level of fundamental groups, any lifting [formula] is an embedding. Moreover, we can choose the lifting to be equivariant with respect to the inclusion H  →  G. Without loss of generality, assume that [formula] is an H-equivariant subcomplex of [formula].

Since the ring [formula] is free as a [formula]-module, it follows that [formula] is a free [formula]-module. Since [formula] is an H-equivariant subcomplex of [formula], the [formula]module [formula] is a free factor of [formula]. Hence the quotient [formula] is a free [formula]module.

Restricting our attention to n-skeleta, the following short exact sequence of chain complexes of [formula]-modules arises

[formula]

Consider the induced long exact homology sequence

[formula]

Since X is the (n + 1)-skeleton of an K(H,1), the homology group [formula] is trivial. Now the exact sequence [\eqref=eq:HXY] can be truncated, obtaining the short exact sequence

[formula]

where ι is induced by the inclusion [formula]. We claim that the short exact sequence [\eqref=SES] satisfies the three hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=RetractionLemma].

First, since X is a finite cell complex, [formula] is finitely generated as a [formula]-module. Therefore [formula] is also finitely generated as a [formula]-module.

Second, the construction of Y guarantees that [formula] is a free [formula]-module, hence [formula] is a free [formula]-module.

Third, we need to verify that [formula] is a projective [formula]-module; in fact we show that it is stably free. Indeed, since X(n) and Y(n) are the (n + 1)-skeletons of a K(H,1) and a K(G,1) respectively, the reduced homology groups [formula] and [formula] are trivial for 1  ≤  k < n. Then, considering the exact sequence [\eqref=eq:HXY], we have that

[formula]

is also exact. Since all the [formula]-modules [formula] are free, and application of Schanuel's Lemma to [\eqref=eq:CYX] and a trivial resolution of [formula] shows that [formula] is a stably free [formula]-module.

Thus we have shown that the short exact sequence [\eqref=SES] satisfies the three hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=RetractionLemma]. Before invoking this lemma and concluding the proof, we set up notation for the norms required to specify representatives of FVn + 1G and FVn + 1H.

Let [formula] denote the [formula]-norm on [formula] induced by the basis consisting on all i-cells of [formula]. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-norm on [formula] induced by a free [formula]-basis; by definition this is also filling norm on [formula]. Then (a representative of) FVn + 1G is given by

[formula]

Since [formula] is a free factor, the [formula]-norm on [formula] induced by the (n + 1)-cells of [formula] equals the restriction of [formula] to [formula]. Let [formula] denote the filling-norm on [formula] as a [formula]-module induced by the boundary map [formula]. Then

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=RetractionLemma] applied to the short exact sequence [\eqref=SES], there exists a constant C1 > 0 and a morphism of [formula]-modules [formula] such that

[formula]

for every [formula], and [formula] is the identity on [formula].

Let [formula] and let [formula] such that [formula]. Then [\eqref=eq:main] implies that

[formula]

Since γ was arbitrary, we have FVn + 1H(k)  ≤  C  ·  FVn + 1G(k).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Main] does not apply to obtain that [formula] for m < n. As mentioned in the introduction, that statement is false. The argument breaks down since [formula] is not projective if m < n.
