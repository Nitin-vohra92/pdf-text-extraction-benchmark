Secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type Instabilities in the Reconnection Exhaust Jet as a Mechanism for Supra-Arcade Downflows

Introduction

Supra-arcade downflows (hereafter referred to as SADs) (also known as tadpoles due to their wavy appearance) are low-emission, elongated features usually observed in active-region coronae above post-eruption flare arcades ([\citealt=mckenzi99] [\citealt=mckenzie00]). SADs arthe extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) using the filter ratio method ([\citealt=hara92]) to deduce the temperature with the data from the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), [\citet=mckenzi99] showed that SADs are low-density (< 109cm- 3), high-temperature ([formula]) structures. This result is supported by [\citet=savage12] as well as the SUMER spectroscopic analysis conducted by [\citet=innes03a]. [\citet=asai04] found that the occurrences of SADs are highly correlated with nonthermal bursts in microwave and hard X-ray (HX the observed high-velocity is not clearly established by these studies. More recently, [\citet=savage11] conducted a statistical study and found that the average velocity of most SADs is around 150km/s, which is a fraction of the typical Alfv�n speed (~  1000 km/s) of the supra-arcade plasma in corona. Furthermore, [\citet=mckenzie13] performed local correlation tracking (LCT) on sequences of EUV images and found that vortices existed at the regions where SADs were observed.

It is important not to confuse SADs with plasmoids or magnetic islands. Observationally, SADs are density depletion regions ([\citealt=savage12] [\citealt=innes03a]), whereas plasmoids are usually density-enhanced structures ([\citealt=lin05] [\citealt=liu10]). Plasmoids are observed edge-on as bright blobs moving along the post-CME current sheet, whereas SADs are most clearly visible when observing the current sheet

Although SA "patchy reconnection" model (e.g., [\citealt=linton06] [\citealt=linton09]) uses intermittently over time along the current sheet layer to triggerThe reconnected magnetic field lines then cause intermittent disturbances in the current sheet as they contract toward the downstream region, and the flux tubes that emerge, with tear drop-like cross-sections, have been interpreted as SADother hand, the SAD model developed by [\citet=Costa09], [\citet=Maglione11], and [\citet=Cecere2012] assumes multiple reconnection sites in which the SADs are a consequence of shocks and rarefactions bouncing back and forth in magnetic structures. In these studies, magnetic reconnection is not directly simulated; instead, reconnection ejections are modeled with localized pressure enhancements in the initial condition. Recently, [\citet=cassak13] proposed that SADs are flow channels carved by low-density, sunward-directed reconnection jets in high-density underlying arcades. In this scenario, reconnection is continuous in time so that the SADs are not filled in from behind as they would be if they were caused by isolated descending flux tube

The studies mentioned above have a common feature that reconnection has to be at least spatially localized, while in some scenarios reconnection has to be temporally localized as well. In this Letter, we show that the finger-like SADs can arise as a result of secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in the downstream region of reconnection in a post-eruption current sheet. This physical mechanism was first suggested in [\citet=asai04] and explored partially by [\citet=tandokoro05] by means of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations primarily in the context of the Earth's magnetotail. In this work we carry out two simulations, one with uniform resistivity and the other with spatially localized anomalous resistivity. We find that Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities arise in both simulations. Dynamic features of the instabilities exhibit good agreement with observations of SADs, and the emulated synthetic emission count rate from simulations also shows qualitative similarities with extreme ultra-violet (EUV) images obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). restingly, the uniform resistivity simulation appears to be in better agreement with observations.

Simulation

In this section, we introduce the setup of our MHD simulation for studies of SADs, the simulation results, and examine their consistency with observations.

Simulation setup

Our numerical model solves the following normalized three-dimensional MHD equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here ρ is the plasma density, [formula] is the plasmas velocity, [formula] is the magnetic field, [formula] is the electric current density, p is the plasma thermal pressure, μ is the plasma viscosity, and η is the plasma resistivity. Our model includes ohmic heating, but exclude viscous heating, heat conduction and radiation cooling. Gravity is not included.

We consider a triply periodic system in the domain - Lx  ≤  x  ≤  Lx , - Ly  ≤  y  ≤  Ly, - Lz  ≤  z  ≤  Lz. However, simulations are carried out in the region 0  ≤  x  ≤  Lx and 0  ≤  z  ≤  Lz, and solutions in the remaining part of the domain are inferred by symmetry. The initial magnetic field is the Harris double current layer [\citep=tandokoro05] defined as:

[formula]

where a is the Harris current sheet width, and B0 is the asymptotic magnetic field strength in the upstream region. The plasma thermal pressure is calculated by the force balance condition:

[formula]

and the density profile is determined by the ideal gas law p = 2ρT0, where T0 is the constant initial temperature and the factor 2 is due to contributions from both electrons and ions. In normalized units, we set T0 = 0.125, B0 = 1, a = 1, and [formula]. The density ρ = 1, the plasma beta [formula], and the Alfven speed VA = 1 in the asymptotic region. The initial density profile is seeded with a random noise o The dimensions of the simulation box are Lx = 150, Ly = 5, Lz = 40, with grids nx = 800, ny = 150, nz = 400, respectively. The + x direction is interpreted as the sunward direction. With this basic setting, we have carried out simulations with uniform, as well as with spatially localized anomalous resistivity.

Uniform resistivity run

In the first run, we use a uniform resistivity [formula] for the whole simulation box. To start the reconnection, we add an initial perturbation to the magnetic field in the x and z directions:

[formula]

[formula]

Subsequently, magnetic reconnection occurs along an extended Sweet-Parker current sheet. plasma ejected by the reconnection outflows accumulate and form a high-density region. Panel (b) of Figure [\ref=fig2] shows a 2D slice of the density profile in the xy plane at z = 0.1, panel (c) shows the temperature profile and panel (d) shows the expected count rate (DN/s/pixel) in the AIA [formula] channel calculated from the simulation data at the same plane.The emission count rate is calculated according to the formula [formula], where f(T) is the AIA [formula] response function ([\citealt=lemen12]), where n is the electron number density, T is the temperature and dl is the line element along the line of sight. To use the response function, the plasma density and temperature have to be converted to dimensional units. Here the density is converted by assuming that unit density in simulation equals 109- 3. The temperature is converted by assuming that the initial normalized Alfven speed VA = 1 in the lobe corresponds to VA = 1000, which gives the initial temperature [formula] for our simulation. Likewise, the initial normalized magnetic field in the lobe (Bcode = 1) corresponds to [formula], which is a reasonable value for the coronal magnetic field.

The finger-like structures are caused by plasma instabilities in the exhaust region of a reconnecting current sheet. As can be seen from Figure [\ref=fig2], the instabilities take place at the interface between lighter reconnection outflows and denser plasma (piled-up density in front of reconnection outflows). Because the reconnection outflows push the relatively stationary plasma ahead, the deceleration existing between lighter and denser plasma plays a role that is equivalent to gravity in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Furthermore, the magnetic field lines in the arcade are highly bent in the downstream region (Figure [\ref=fig2]), producing unfavorable curvature that makes the system potentially unstable to the ballooning instability (cf. [\citealt=bhattacharjee98]). While we have not carried out a detailed linear stability analysis and leave this to future work, we propose that the finger-like SADs in the downstream region are results of the nonlinear evolution of instabilities of the Rayleigh-Taylor/ballooning type.

The typical speed of the SADs (speed of the tip motion) in this run is [formula], which is comparable to the observed value. The instabilities also induce transverse motion of SADs. Figure [\ref=fig3] shows the flow pattern on the x - y plane, overplotted on the density profile shown in color. Downward moving tadpoles and upward moving spikes can be seen in Figure [\ref=fig3], as well as vortices. The plasma in the cusp region/supra-arcade fan is quite turbulent due to secondary instabilities. The observations of eddies co-existing with SADs have been reported by [\citet=mckenzie13].

the four panels of Figure [\ref=fig2], we see that there are two clusters of finger-like structures, one at [formula] and the other at [formula]. Throughout the whole simulation, there are four clusters of finger-like structures.

Anomalous resistivity run

To test how the reconnection mechanism may affect the instabilities in the downstream region, we have carried out a second run with Petschek-type reconnection triggered by introducing a locally enhanced anomalous resistivity η  =  η0 exp ( - x2 - z2), with [formula]. The Petschek-type reconnection soon creates a shock-like front propagating along the + x direction, with the Bz component and the plasma density ρ piled up on the downstream side of the front.as shown in Figure [\ref=fig4]. Panel (a) of Figure [\ref=fig4] shows a projected view of magnetic field lines, and a slice of the Bz profile at z = 0.1. Panel (b) of Figure [\ref=fig4] shows a 2D slice of the density profile on the x - y plane at z = 0.1. Panel (c) shows the temperature profile, and panel (d) shows the AIA [formula] emission count rate calculated from the simulation data on the same plane.

The finger-like structures in Figure [\ref=fig4] consist of two parts. The "tadpoles" move in the + x (sunward) direction and have low density, high temperature, and weak emission, and the "spikes" are fingers developing toward the - x (anti-sunward) direction with higher density, lower temperature, and brighter emission.

Note that although a locally enhanced anomalous resistivity is employed in this run, the localized resistivity is uniform in the y direction (along the current sheet layer) and constant over time. Therefore, the finger-like SADs are caused by instabilities and not a direct result of anomalous resistivity. Furthermore, the SADs in this run are qualitatively similar to the ones we obtained with the uniform resistivity. This suggests that the reconnection mechanism in the upstream region does not directly affect instabilities in the downstream region. Nevertheless, there are some differences regarding where and when the SADs take place and the visual propagation speed of SADs, which we will discuss in the next section.

Summary and Conclusions

The mechanism causing the formation of SADs has been an open question since their first discovery. Existing simulations of SADs depend on intermittently and locally induced reconnection events to reproduce finger-like SADs along current sheet layers. In addition, questions such as why the speeds of SADs are much slower than the Alfven speed paper, we describe simulations to test the idea that SADs might be the result of essentially ideal plasma instabilities in the downstream region of a reconnection site. We implement resistive MHD models with both uniform and spatially localized anomalous resistivity. Finger-like structures are generated in both runs with different dynamic behaviors. The comparisons between our simulations and observations of SADs can be summarized as follows:

Our results indicate that the exhaust region of magnetic reconnection can become unstable to Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, and the resulting finger-like structures exhibit features qualitatively similar to observations of SADs. Most importantly, we have shown that SADs can arise without reconnection being patchy, i.e. localized in either space or time (or both). In fact, the reconnection site in both runs of this study does not develop apparent 3D (i.e. y-dependent) structures, and reconnection continues at a constant rate throughout the simulations. Of course, in reality the reconnection site is likely to exhibit 3D effects, either due to the local onset of reconnection or 3D instabilities in the current sheet. It will be interesting to study how the 3D nature of the reconnection site affects the structures in the exhaust region.

In conclusion, our results suggest that Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in the downstream region of a reconnecting current sheet provide a plausible mechanism for the formation of SADs. Between the two models of resistivity employed in our simulations, the uniform resistivity appears to agree better with observations. Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities have also been observed in recent fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations ([\citealt=Vapirev13]). Further study of the instabilities with different underlying models and detailed comparison with observations should shed new light on the nature of SADs, as well as what can be learned about the structure of the reconnection site from the appearance of SADs.
