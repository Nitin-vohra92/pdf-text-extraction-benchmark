Quantum spatial search on planar networks

Introduction

One of the key motivations for the development of quantum information theory is the possibility to utilize quantum systems for computational purposes. Main progress in this field has been done since two most known algorithms were introduced - Grover's search and Shor's factorization algorithms. In this work we study the issue of the of computational resources necessary to perform effective computational tasks in quantum systems. The issue has been studied in terms of the possible interactions represented by a connection graph [\cite=mater2013blueprint] [\cite=konno2013spectral] [\cite=watrous2001undirected] [\cite=konno2013spectral], most commonly within quantum walk notation [\cite=portugal2013quantum].

The original Grover's search algorithm corresponds to an underlying complete graph of connections [\cite=portugal2013quantum]. Related results considering the quantum search on less complex networks are based on such graphs as hypercubes 2n [\cite=shenvi2003walksearch], twisted toroids [\cite=douglas2013complexity], Hanoi networks [\cite=marquezino2013hanoi] and other. These graphs are not planar. Moreover, the networks exhibit high symmetry and in particular in each of the cases all of the nodes can be considered equivalent. The results regarding the effectiveness of the quantum walk search on general networks are based on asymptotic complexity analysis [\cite=ambainis2007quantum].

Our goal is to find a network suitable for efficient computation with properties similar to the 2-dimensional grid which is planar and sparse. We turn our attention onto iteratively generated planar networks. For this purpose we study Apollonian networks. These networks are planar and the average node degree converges to a constant number. Additionally, the nodes in the network are not equivalent (even in the case of the last generation nodes only), what could allow quantum phenomena to occur [\cite=faccin2013degree].

In this work we focus on showing that the asymptotic search complexity is not enough to determine the possibility to successfully implement search algorithm and when it is possible to efficiently utilise Apollonian network for search purposes. In particular, we consider two cases of possible marked nodes location regions and show that they lead to the same asymptotic results. However, when we consider the possibility to implement the search with single measurement we show that the basic search approach fails but the appropriate use of the symmetry in the network allows us to maintain the optimal quantum search speed-up.

Apollonian networks

We focus on an example of highly symmetric iteratively generated planar network - Apollonian network - an undirected graph constructed during the process of filling the plane with circles [\cite=boyd73osculatory] [\cite=boyd73residual]. Namely, we consider a graph representing connections between the circles. Each node represents one circle and is connected with nodes that represent neighbouring circles. While adding new circle to the plane a new node is created with appropriate connections. Equivalently it can be defined as the result of subdivision of a triangle into smaller triangles, which is the case of three initial circles on the plane. The model is also considered with various modifications. In particular random Apollonian networks are created by dividing only a number of triangles in the network. A model defined this way can be used to describe a vast variety of iteratively generated planar networks. Any iteratively generated family of planar networks where each new node created during creation process is connected with all possible neighbours can be considered as Apollonian network. Apollonian networks have attracted extensive attention in the field of studying large complex networks due to their small-world and scale-free properties. For more detailed analysis of the properties of Apollonian networks we refer to [\cite=doye05self-similar].

The main motivation to execute spatial search algorithm on Apollonian network is the network complexity. Basic version of the Grover's algorithm requires a complete network to run [\cite=portugal2013quantum]. This means that the system with N positions must support [formula] interactions. Additionally, the degree of all nodes is equal to N - 1.

In the case of Apollonian network the total number of connections increases linearly and is equal to

[formula]

where the number of nodes in the network N is related to the generation K of the network by the formula

[formula]

Additionally, maximum node degree in the network is

[formula]

while the average node degree is equal to [formula] and converges to 6.

Quantum walk search on Apollonian network

In this section we aim at introducing a quantum walk model. We consider asymptotic search complexity and discuss possibility to implement the search with a single measurement. We consider two cases and provide a comparison.

The model for the quantum walk algorithm

Quantum walks model has been introduced as a modification of classical random walks [\cite=zagury1993walks]. Most attention was paid to quantum walks on a line, a lattice and other regular graphs [\cite=kempe2003overview] [\cite=aharonov2001ongraphs] [\cite=childs2004spatialsearch].

In the usual quantum walk model we consider a bipartite system [formula]. Every step of the evolution U is a composition of coin and shift operators

[formula]

where [formula] is the initial state. In this case the coin operator acts on the internal state subspace. Because we consider a regular structure the internal state space is the same for each position. Thus, the overall operator can be represented as a tensor product.

When the considered network is not regular we need to modify the usual product space model. We consider all the possible pairs (j,i), where node i is connected to node j. Let us denote the degrees of all of the nodes in the network by d1,...,dN such that the degree of i-th node is equal to di. We construct a space of dimension equal to [formula] with basis vectors [formula], where [formula] denotes the relation between joined nodes. The space can be represented as a direct sum of subspaces corresponding to the subsequent nodes. We attribute every position i with a space [formula] and consider a quantum system defined as

[formula]

We denote basis states by [formula] which represent a state with position equal to i directed to node j. The shift operator in this walk is defined as

[formula]

Additionally, before each shift the coin operator is applied. In the general case, when Ci denotes the coin operator for i-th node, the overall operator denotes

[formula]

In order to execute the walk performing the search procedure we set Ci  =  Gdi, where Gd is a d-dimensional Grover's diffusion operator

[formula]

The only exception is the marked node where the coin operator is multiplied by ( - 1) such that Cm  =   - Gdm.

In this work for the search purposes we assume that the initial state [formula] is an equal superposition over a fixed set of basis states. In particular we consider the whole basis and the states with position representing nodes form the last generation of a given network.

Asymptotic complexity

In this section we recall the results that imply that searching for an arbitrary node in a network within the introduced quantum walk model is possible with complexity [formula]. We stress that this results do not give any formula for the exact time step to perform the measurement and consider each of the marked states separately thus do not determine whether it is possible to choose a common measurement step time that succeeds for marking any of the nodes.

Let H be a finite dimensional Hilbert space and [formula] be an orthonormal basis for H. Let [formula] be two states in H which are superpositions of [formula] with real amplitudes and [formula]. Let U1,U2 be unitary transformations on H with the following properties:

U1 is the transformation that flips the phase on [formula] ([formula] and leaves any state orthogonal to [formula] unchanged.

U2 is a transformation which is described by a real-valued m  ×  m matrix in the basis [formula]. Moreover, [formula] and, if [formula] is an eigenvector of U2 perpendicular to [formula], then [formula] for θ∈[σ,2π   -   σ] (where σ is a constant, σ > 0)

Then, there exists t  =  O(1 / α) such that [formula]. (The constant under Ω(1) is independent of α but can depend on σ.)

In this paper we consider the space given in Eq. ([\ref=eq:directsumspace]) with basis states [formula] and operators U1 = Om, U2 = SC which are real in the considered basis. The operator Om satisfies property 1 trivially. We prove property 2 for the operator SC on a restricted state space with use of the following fact.

Lets denote the subspace spanned by the λ-eigenvectors of U2 for [formula] by [formula]. The subspace X' < X spanned by the states from [formula] satisfies:

[formula],

[formula], [formula],

[formula] for [formula], [formula].

Pt. a) is satisfied trivially. The marked state [formula] belongs to X' because is is assumed to be a local equal superposition. The states not included in X' are exactly 1-eigenvectors orthogonal to the initial state and can be expressed as states that are orthogonal to any local equal superposition. It follows from the fact that the U2 operator is a composition of two operators that exhibits only [formula] eigenvalues. Thus, any 1-eigenvector of U2 is a common 1 (or -1) eigenvector of S and C. The initial state is the only common 1 eigenvector. Common -1 eigenvectors are in particular -1 eigenvectors of the Grover's diffusion operator and thus are locally orthogonal to any possible target state. Pt. c) is a consequence of the two. We can now consider the operators O and SC in the X' space so that the condition 2 is met.

The proposed method works for any network if the applied operators are constructed the same way.

The number of steps required to find any marked state using procedure described in section [\ref=sec:model] adopted for any Apollonian network is [formula].

We showed that searching for any marked node in the Apollonian network with the introduced search model requires [formula] steps. The above results suggest that regardless to the set selection the search complexity is optimal. In the following section we will consider various approaches to the search problem with different sets of nodes that can be marked.

Measurement step

Obtaining an effective search algorithm requires translating the final state into classical information about the result. In the case of quantum systems it is performed by a measurement. The decision about making a measurement needs to be made without any knowledge about the searched node. Thus, it is crucial that the designed algorithm enables us to obtain high success probability for every possible node in the same step of the evolution. In the case of the original Grover's search it is satisfied due to completely symmetric network structure. When using less complex networks we need to ensure that regardless of the localization of the marked node algorithm efficiency is maintained with use of exactly the same operations.

In this work we aim for analysis of iteratively generated planar networks. We showed that the asymptotic complexity of the search is the same for all of the nodes. In particular, we provide an example of the 8th generation Apollonian network case. Contrary to the asymptotic results, the numerical results show that for nodes from different generations of the network the optimal measurement time is different. This is caused by the fact that the asymptotic complexity considers each of the positions separately and neglects the constant factor of the overall complexity trend. The numerical results show how this constant factor differs for various classes of nodes. The probability of measuring a marked node averaged among the nodes from the same generation is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:avg-prob-by-gen]. In this case the probability dynamics is very similar for nodes form the same generation, but the step of optimal measurement for nodes from different generations varies significantly. Thus, it is not possible to fix the measurement time such that the algorithm works efficiently when marking arbitrary node in the network is allowed.

In this work we differentiate the two cases. The search among all of the nodes and search among nodes form the last generation. Both cases exhibits the same asymptotic complexity but only the later allows us to perform successful search with fixed measurement step.

We utilise the fact that for every node created in the last iteration the success probability is maximal at the same time step and search with the following algorithm:

Prepare a superposition of all nodes from the last generation.

Run quantum walk.

Perform a projection onto the subspace of last generation nodes.

Measure the position register.

Such approach guarantees that in the moment of measurement the probability of successful search will be maximized regardless of the choice of the marked node. The projection step can be interpreted as a measurement with post-selection. The possibility of measuring the desired subspace is approximately one half as the amplitudes localizes approximately equally in the marked node and its neighbours. Moreover, if the measurement fails the state of the systems almost surely evolves into desired subspace after application of the shift operator. Thus the complexity of the procedure is not affected by the projection.

Numerical simulation

Performing the search tasks as described in section [\ref=sec:strategy] one is able to measure the marked node with the probabilities presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:cosinuses]. The maximum probability and the corresponding steps are presented in Table [\ref=tab:time].

Let's note that the number of nodes increases exponentially with generation number

[formula]

As presented in Table [\ref=tab:time] the time of maximum success probability increases three times every two generations. For this reason one can assume that the optimal measurement step T0 can be expressed as

[formula]

where α is a scaling constant. With this assumption and using Eq. ([\ref=eq:number-of-nodes]) one obtains

[formula]

This allows us to estimate the complexity of the algorithm as

[formula]

which induces a quadratic speed-up with respect to the classical algorithm. Thus, we obtain the optimal speed-up rate for a quantum search algorithm with use of an Apollonian network in the case of the restricted search.

Concluding remarks

This work is motivated by the search for simple quantum system structures that are sufficient for efficient computation. We described a quantum walk search procedure on general graph. For the purpose of determining network computational potential we applied the existing asymptotic complexity evaluation methods. We showed that the asymptotic complexity for the given model is optimal - [formula]. The analytical results show that asymptotic complexity is the same for any search scheme. We focus on showing that the asymptotic complexity is not enough for determining the potential of the network.

We perform a numerical study in the case of a quantum walk on Apollonian network. We considered two cases of the search. We have developed an algorithm that can be used to search for an arbitrary node and a node from the last generation of an Apollonian network aiming at searching with fixed measurement step. The approach is not possible to adopt for whole network search. We show numerical evidence that in the restricted search approach it is possible to adopt Grover's search algorithm with a measurement time independent from the localization of the marked node while maintaining the efficiency. Numerical results performed for generations 4-8, that consist of 43-3283 nodes, allowed us suggesting the estimate of the algorithm complexity which is consistent with analytical predictions. Provided algorithm exhibits quadratic speed-up in relation to the classical counterpart.

The presented approach exhibits not only quadratic speed-up with respect to the classical algorithms, but also allows us to obtain quadratic reduction of the complexity of the network compared to the basic quantum counterpart by using a network with O(N) number of connections instead of O(N2) in the complete network case.
