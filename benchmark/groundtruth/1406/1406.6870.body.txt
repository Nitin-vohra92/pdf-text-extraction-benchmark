1. Introduction

Graph considered here are all finite and undirected with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G). A multigraph is a graph with multiple edges. If every vertex in a graph has the same degree r then this graph is referred to as a r-regular graph. A matching M in G is a set of independent edges, and |M| denotes the number of edges in M. A factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph of G. A k-factor of G is a factor of G that is k-regular. Thus a 1-factor of G is a matching that saturates all vertices of G, and is called a perfect matching of G. A mapping l:E(G)  →  A, where A is an abelian group which written additively, is called a labeling of the graph G. Given a labeling l of the graph G, the symbol s(v), which represents the sum of the labels of edges incident with v, is defined to be [formula], where v∈V(G). For every positive integer [formula], a graph G is said to be zero-sum h-magic if there is an edge labeling from E(G) into [formula] such that s(v)  =  0 for every vertex v∈V(G). The null set of a graph G, denoted by N(G), is the set of all natural numbers [formula] such that G admits a zero-sum h-magic labeling.

Recently, Saieed Akbari, Farhad Rahmati and Sanaz Zare [formula] obtained the following interesting results about magic labeling of regular graphs.

They also proposed the following conjecture in [formula].

In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this conjecture. The following lemma is essential in the proof of the conjecture.

2. Main Results

In this section, we will give a proof of the Conjecture.

If a graph G has vertices v1, v2, [formula], vn, the sequence d=(d1, d2, [formula], dn) is called the degree sequence of G, where di = d(vi) for [formula]. A nonincreasing and nonnegative integer sequence d=(d1, d2, [formula], dn) is graphical if there is a simple graph with degree sequence d. It is obvious that the conditions [formula] for all i, and [formula] being even are necessary for a sequence to be graphical. Firstly, the following lemma will be obtained.

Proof    For convenience, we let Gn denote the corresponding graph related to the sequence d=(d1, d2, [formula], dn).

Firstly, we prove that if d1 = d2 = [formula] = dn = 5 and [formula] then d is graphical. The proof is by induction on n. If n = 6, then it is a obvious result since the complete graph K6 being the graph G6 with degree sequence (5,5,5,5,5,5). When n = 8, the corresponding graph G8 is obtained from G6 through the following construction. Let V(G6)={v1, v2, [formula], v6}. Firstly, we add two new vertices v7 and v8 to G6, and add an edge connecting v7 and v8. Secondly, we select, in G6, two different matchings M1 and M2 with [formula] and |M1|=|M2|=2. Deleting the four edges in [formula] from G6, and connecting the four vertices in M1 to v7, the other four vertices in M2 to v8, we get the graph G8 with degree sequence (5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5). Now, suppose that [formula]. By induction hypothesis the 2k-elements sequence [formula] is graphical and the corresponding graph is G2k. So the graph G2(k + 1) can be obtained from G2k through the same procedure as that of G6 to G8, and the proof is complete.

As for the case d1 = d2 = [formula] = dn = 4 and [formula], we also through the induction on n. If n = 6, then it is an easy work to find a 4-regular graph G6 with degree sequence (4,4,4,4,4,4). When n = 8, the corresponding graph G8 is obtained from G6 through the following operation. Let V(G6)={v1, v2, [formula], v6}. Firstly, we add two new vertices v7 and v8 to G6, and select, in G6, two different matchings M1 and M2 with [formula] and |M1|=|M2|=2. Deleting the four edges in [formula], and connecting the four vertices in M1 to v7, the other four vertices in M2 to v8, we get the graph G8 with degree sequence (4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4). Now, suppose that [formula]. By induction hypothesis the 2k-elements sequence [formula] is graphical and the corresponding graph is G2k. So the graph G2(k + 1) can be obtained from G2k through the same procedure as that of G6 to G8, and the proof is complete. [formula]

Proof    It is obvious that every 5-regular graph G is of even order since 2  ·  E(G) = 5  ·  V(G). For |V(G)| < 6, the correctness of the theorem is easily to verify. When [formula], according to the Lemma 1.1 and Lemma 2.1 we can get that every 5-regular graph G contains a 1-factor. So, labeling the edges in the 1-factor with 2 ([formula]) and the remaining edges with 1 ([formula]), we will get a zero-sum 3-magic labeling of the 5-regular graph. [formula]

The following theorem can be easily deduced from the Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 2.1.
