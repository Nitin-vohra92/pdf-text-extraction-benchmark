The main results of [\citet=Haller-Beron-13]

We consider a two-dimensional velocity field v(x,t), with x labeling the location within a two-dimensional region U of interest and with t referring to time. Fluid trajectories generated by v(x,t) are denoted x(t;t0,x0), with x0 referring to the initial position of the trajectory at time t0. These trajectories solve the differential equation

[formula]

and generate the flow map

[formula]

which takes an initial position x0 at time t0 to its current position at time t.

The right Cauchy-Green strain tensor field associated with the flow map is defined as [formula], with eigenvalues λi(x0) and eigenvectors ξi(x0) satisfying

[formula]

In [\citet=Haller-Beron-13] we sought the time t0 positions of Lagrangian vortex boundaries as closed stationary curves of the averaged Lagrangian strain. Such curves turned out to coincide with the zero-energy solutions of a one-parameter family of variational problems defined as

[formula]

Here the strain energy functional Eλ(γ) is defined through the generalized Green-Lagrange strain tensor family

[formula]

Consider the flow domain

[formula]

where the tensor field Eλ has two nonzero eigenvalues of opposite sign. Then the quadratic function

[formula]

defines a Lorentzian metric [\citep=Beem-etal-96] on Uλ, with signature ( - , + ) inherited from the eigenvalue configuration of Eλ. The zero-energy solutions of ([\ref=eq:qdef-1]) are therefore precisely the closed null-geodesics of the Lorentzian metric gλ, which satisfy one of the two differential equations

[formula]

In [\citet=Haller-Beron-13] we concluded that closed orbits of ([\ref=eq:ode-1]) (termed closed λ-lines) must necessarily encircle metric singularities of gλ. Such singularities occur at points x0 where λ1(r) = λ2(r) holds for the eigenvalues of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor.

The Lorentzian metric interpretation discussed above implies a geometric analogy between coherent Lagrangian vortex boundaries and photon spheres in cosmology. Below we give more detail on this analogy, followed by an improved version of its summary with a more relevant reference.

More on the analogy with photon spheres

In the vicinity of any λ-line in Uλ, the vector fields ξi define a curvilinear coordinate system with pointwise orthogonal coordinate lines. Direct substitution of ξi into the metric ([\ref=eq:g]) gives

[formula]

showing that gλ(ξ1,ξ1) < 0 and gλ(ξ2,ξ2) > 0 everywhere in Uλ. This shows that ξ1-trajectories form the time-like coordinates and the ξ2-trajectories form the space-like coordinates of the metric gλ in Uλ [\citep=Beem-etal-96]. We further note that gλ(η±λ,η±λ) = 0, and hence a λ-line is nowhere space-like in the language of Lorentzian geometry. Given that our closed null-geodesics are nowhere space-like hypersurfaces built out of null-geodesics, they are photon surfaces by the general definition of [\citet=Claudel-etal-01].

Next we note that

[formula]

Consequently, trajectories of the ξ1(r) line field (ξ1 coordinate lines) intersect any closed λ-line γ transversally, with an angle of intersection that is always less than [formula], as sketched qualitatively in Figure [\ref=fig:proj]. In the same figure, we also show a representative trajectory of the ξ2(r) line field (a ξ2 coordinate line) which is pointwise orthogonal to the ξ1 coordinate lines by construction. We conclude that the projection of γ onto a space-like submanifold along the time-like coordinates results in a periodic (albeit discontinuous) space-like orbit (cf. Figure [\ref=fig:proj]).

In summary, a closed orbit γ of the η±λ(r) vector field is a photon surface of the (Uλ,gλ) space-time. Geodesics forming this photon surface have periodically moving projections on the space-like coordinates, with the projection taken along the time-like coordinate lines.

The orbit γ, therefore, satisfies a plausible extension of the Claudel-Virbhadra-Ellis definition of a photon sphere [\citep=Claudel-etal-01] from symmetric higher-dimensional space-times to non-symmetric two-dimensional space-times. This extension relaxes the requirement for a rotational symmetry and smoothness of the projected spatially periodic orbits. Both of these features are unattainable in curved, two-dimensional space-times, and hence can be reasonably waived.

Revised wording of the cosmological analogy

In view of the above discussion, the wording of the mathematical analogy between coherent Lagrangian eddy boundaries and photon spheres in cosmology [\citep=Haller-Beron-13] should be revised as follows:
