Comment on "Discretisations of constrained KP hierarchies"

The pioneering works of Calogero and Degasperis [\cite=Calo75] [\cite=Calo76], Chiu and Ladik [\cite=Chiu77], Hirota [\cite=Hiro77] and Orfanidis [\cite=Orfa1] [\cite=Orfa2] in the late 1970s revealed that a certain class of auto-Bäcklund transformations and the associated nonlinear superposition principle (Bianchi's permutability theorem) can directly provide integrable discretizations of the original continuous equations. Some relevant results can be found in [\cite=QNCL] [\cite=NCWQ] [\cite=NQC83].

In 1982, Konopelchenko [\cite=Kono82] (also see Chudnovsky-Chudnovsky [\cite=Chud1] [\cite=Chud2]) presented an elementary auto-Bäcklund transformation and the associated nonlinear superposition principle for the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) hierarchy; the latter reads

[formula]

where μn and νm are arbitrary Bäcklund parameters that can depend on one of the two discrete independent variables m and n. It was rediscovered by Date, Jimbo and Miwa [\cite=DJM83] in 1983 as an integrable discrete NLS system. Note that unlike the Ablowitz-Ladik discretizations [\cite=Chiu77] [\cite=AL1] [\cite=AL77], this discretization does not admit the complex conjugation reduction between qm,n and rm,n, so it is not a proper discretization of the NLS equation.

By construction, the fully discrete NLS system ([\ref=superpo]) possesses an infinite set of higher symmetries in each lattice direction. For example, the first nontrivial symmetry in the n-direction is given by the elementary auto-Bäcklund transformation [\cite=Kono82] [\cite=Chud1]:

[formula]

for any fixed value of m. Other polynomial symmetries in the n-direction [\cite=Chud1] are obtained from the continuous NLS flows by eliminating the x-derivatives using ([\ref=x-deri]). Note that, with a minor reformulation, ([\ref=x-deri]) can generate an infinite set of continuous NLS flows [\cite=Vek02] [\cite=DM06] [\cite=DM-SIGMA], so all the information on an infinite number of polynomial higher symmetries in the n-direction is encoded in one symmetry ([\ref=x-deri]). By changing the notation as rn + 1  →  pn, x  →    -  t1, we obtain a more familiar form of the differential-difference system [\cite=Chud1] [\cite=Chud2]:

[formula]

This lattice system (mostly in the simple case of μn  =  0 or - 1) has been rediscovered repeatedly in the literature; some earlier references are [\cite=SY91] [\cite=SviYami91] [\cite=Zhang91] and the inverse scattering method was developed in [\cite=Bhate].

Even without such preknowledge about its origin, the fully discrete system ([\ref=superpo]) allows us to generate an infinite set of higher symmetries using the notion of Miwa shifts. To this aim, we consider a rescaling [formula], rm + 1,n  →    -  νmrm + 1,n for all n and rewrite ([\ref=superpo]) as

[formula]

Then, by setting [formula] where hm is a step-size parameter in the m-direction and taking the limit hm  →  0, we obtain higher symmetries starting from ([\ref=x-deri]).

Besides such polynomial higher symmetries, the fully discrete NLS system ([\ref=superpo]) also possesses rational higher symmetries. By setting μn  =  μ, νm  =  μ  +  δm where δm is a step-size parameter in the (m + n)-direction and taking the limit δm  →  0 in such a way that qm + 1,n + 1  -  qm,n  →  0, we obtain higher symmetries in the n-direction starting from

[formula]

By changing the notation as rn + 1  →  pn and superimposing ([\ref=x-deri2]) in the case of a constant μn, we obtain a (not proper) integrable space discretization of the NLS system:

[formula]

This lattice system was introduced by Gerdjikov and Ivanov [\cite=GI2] in 1982 and rediscovered by Merola, Ragnisco and Tu [\cite=Tu]; it is related to the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice [\cite=AL1] through a nonlocal transformation of dependent variables involving an infinite product [\cite=GI2]. This transformation can be rewritten in a local form if one uses a τ-function formalism (cf. [\cite=TD11]). Note incidentally that in arXiv:1204.2928, Gerdjikov proposed a new type of integrable three-wave equations with a Lax pair, but these results were previously reported in .3 of arXiv:1012.2458.

All the above discussion (except the τ-function formalism) can be generalized straightforwardly to the case of matrix-valued dependent variables, but we focused on the scalar case to enhance readability.
