Studies of the superconducting properties of Sn[formula]In[formula]Te ([formula] to 0.45) using muon-spin spectroscopy

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, with surfaces that have a gapless metallic state that is protected by time-reversal symmetry, has generated considerable excitement.[\cite=Hasan] [\cite=Qi] Further interest has resulted from the work that showed that CuxBi2Se3 could be made superconducting, although the studies of superconductivity in this material have sometimes been hampered by the inhomogeneity of the samples.[\cite=Hor] [\cite=Kriener] [\cite=Das] The half-Heusler compounds YPtBi, LaPtBi, and LuPtBi, all of which have noncentrosymmetric crystal structures and strong spin-orbit coupling, have also been investigated as candidates for 3D topological superconductivity.[\cite=Butch] [\cite=Goll] [\cite=Tafti]

The existence of a different class of materials called topological crystalline insulators (TCI), in which the mirror symmetry rather than time-reversal symmetry produces the topologically protected metallic surface states, was proposed by Fu.[\cite=Fu] Subsequent experimental work, including angle-resolved photo emission spectroscopy (ARPES), has shown that SnTe exhibits all the required characteristics of this TCI state.[\cite=Hsieh] [\cite=Tanaka]

SnTe crystallizes in the rock salt structure and is classified a TCI because it satisfies the conditions required for the mirror symmetry. It is a narrow band semiconductor and in the as-grown state it usually forms with a number of Sn vacancies and is perhaps better described as Sn1 - δTe where δ is around 1%. The Sn vacancies introduce holes. When the level of vacancies reaches 1020 cm- 3, Sn1 - δTe is a superconductor, but with a superconducting critical temperature Tc remaining below 0.3 K for hole carrier densities p up to [formula] cm- 3.

Tc can be enhanced by replacing Sn with In.[\cite=Erickson] This doping with In introduces one further hole per In atom. For x less than some critical In doping level xc  ≈   ~ 2%, or viewed another way, for a hole doping level p less than a critical level [formula] cm- 3, Sn1 - xInxTe undergoes a ferroelectric structural phase transition adopting a rhombohedral structure at low temperature, while above this critical In doping level x  ≥  xc these materials remain cubic to zero kelvin.[\cite=Erickson] For In substitution levels of around 6% in Sn0.988 - xInxTe, the Tc of these materials is around 2 K. Point contact spectroscopy and ARPES measurements on Sn1 - xInxTe with low levels of In substitution (x  =  0.045) show the signature of a topological surface state [\cite=Sato] and suggest that this low-carrier-density superconductor exhibits surface Andreev bound states, odd-parity pairing, and topological superconductivity.[\cite=Sasaki2] More recently, it has been shown [\cite=Zhong] [\cite=Balakrishnan] that higher levels of In substitution ([formula] to 0.45) in Sn1 - xInxTe gives a superconductor with a transition temperature as high as [formula] K.

Studies of the bulk characteristics of Sn1 - xInxTe, a material in which the superconductivity emerges from a parent TCI material, are essential in order to develop a more complete understanding of this important new class of materials. To this end, we have used muon-spin rotation and relaxation, μSR, to investigate the superconducting properties of Sn1 - xInxTe for 0.38  ≤  x  ≤  0.45. This level of In substitution gives close to the optimum Tc for this system. μSR is an ideal probe to study the superconducting state as it provides microscopic information on the local field distribution within the bulk of the sample. It can be used to measure the temperature and field dependence of the London magnetic penetration depth, λ, in the vortex state of type-II superconductors. [\cite=Sonier] [\cite=Brandt] The temperature and field dependence of λ can in turn provide detailed information on the nature of the superconducting gap. This technique can also be used to detect small internal magnetic fields associated with the onset of an unconventional superconducting state.[\cite=Aoki] [\cite=Luke] [\cite=Hillier]

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Sample preparation

Samples of Sn1 - xInxTe for x = 0.38, 0.40, 0.42, and 0.45, were prepared by the modified Bridgman method adopting a similar procedure to that described by Tanaka et al. [\cite=Tanaka] for SnTe. Stoichiometric ratios of the starting materials, 99.99% Sn,(shot) In (shot) and Te (powder), were placed in evacuated and sealed quartz ampoules. The quartz tubes were then heated to around [formula]C and slowly cooled ([formula]C/h) to [formula]C, followed by a fast cooling to room temperature.

Powder x-ray diffraction on powdered portions of the as grown boules were carried out using a Panalytical X' Pert Pro system with monochromatic Cu[formula] radiation.

Measurements of dc magnetization M as a function of temperature T at fixed applied field H, were made using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) SQUID magnetometer, while measurements of the dc magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field at fixed temperature were carried out in an Oxford Instruments vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).

Muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments

Muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments were performed on the MuSR spectrometer of the ISIS pulsed muon facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. At ISIS, a pulse of muons with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of [formula] ns is produced every 20 ms. The 100% spin-polarized muons are implanted into a sample and after coming to rest the muon spin precesses in the local magnetic environment. The muons, with an average lifetime of 2.2 ~ μs, decay emitting a positron preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay.

In transverse-field (TF) mode, an external magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the initial direction of the muon spin polarization. The magnetic field was applied above the superconducting transition and the samples then cooled to base temperature (FC). In this configuration the signals from the instrument's 64 detectors were reduced to two orthogonal components which were then fitted simultaneously. Data were also collected in zero-field (ZF) mode. Here, the decay positrons from the muons were detected and time stamped in the detectors which are positioned either before [formula] or after [formula] the sample. The asymmetry in the positron emission as a function of time can then be determined as [formula], where NF(t) and NB(t) are the counts in the forward and backward detectors respectively, and α is a relative counting efficiency for the forward and backward detectors.[\cite=Lee:book] [\cite=Yaouanc:book] In ZF mode, any stray fields at the sample position are canceled to within 10 μT by three pairs of coils forming an active compensation system.

The powdered samples of Sn1 - xInxTe were mounted on high-purity silver plates. For each sample, the powder was packed into a circular indentation [formula] mm deep and [formula] mm2 in area, cut into the square plate. In order to aid thermal contact, a small amount of General Electric (GE) varnish diluted with ethanol was added to the samples and the mixture allowed to dry. In the TF mode, any silver exposed to the muon beam gives a non-decaying sinusoidal signal, while in the ZF relaxation experiments, any muons stopped in the silver sample holder give a time independent background. The x = 0.38 and 0.45 samples were covered with thin silver foil and measured in an Oxford Instruments He3 sorption cryostat with a base temperature of 0.30 K. The intermediate compositions with x = 0.40 and 0.42 were covered with Al foil and were studied in a conventional Oxford Instruments He4 cryostat with a base temperature of 1.1 K.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Structural Characterization

The observed powder x-ray diffraction patterns collected at room temperature for the Sn1 - xInxTe are consistent with the published patterns for the SnTe (x = 0) parent phase and the In doped Sn1 - xInxTe materials.[\cite=Zhigarev] [\cite=Zhong] The materials all have a cubic Fmm structure. The lattice parameters calculated from the data are shown in Table [\ref=table_of_latticeparameters]. These values agree well with the published results for Sn1 - xInxTe which show that there is a linear decrease in the lattice parameter a with increasing x until at around x = 0.40 to 0.45, a becomes almost constant with x.[\cite=Zhigarev] [\cite=Zhong] All our samples contain a small fraction of the tetragonal InTe phase, and the level of this phase increases with x. Once again this is consistent with previous published work which showed compositions around [formula] contain both the cubic and tetragonal materials, while for [formula] only the tetragonal phase of Sn1 - xInxTe is formed.[\cite=Zhong]

Superconducting properties

Measurements of the dc magnetic susceptibility ([formula]) as a function of temperature were used to investigate the onset of superconductivity. [formula] measurements were carried out in applied fields of 2 mT. Figure [\ref=Figure1Saghir] shows the zero-field-cooled warming (ZFCW) data for all four samples we have studied and the field-cooled cooling (FCC) data for the sample with x = 0.45. The transition temperature of each sample is taken as the temperature at which we observe the onset of a clear (5% of the full Meissner signal) diamagnetic signal. Tc increases slightly with increasing x saturating at around 4.80(5) K for x = 0.45, in good agreement with of previous studies of the doping dependence of Tc. [\cite=Zhong] [\cite=Balakrishnan] The transitions are all rather broad and the magnetization observed in the superconducting state only begins to saturate at the lowest temperatures measured. We also note that a very small diamagnetic signal extends up to higher temperature (e.g. up to T = 5.14(2) K in the case of the x = 0.45 sample). Figure [\ref=Figure1Saghir] also shows the field-cooled cooling data for one of the four samples. On cooling, there is an expulsion of the flux at the same temperature as on heating. The low temperature diamagnetic signal is around one tenth of that seen in the ZFCW data at 1.8 K indicating considerable bulk pinning of the magnetic flux.

The lower critical fields Hc1 estimated from the first deviation from linearity in the low-field regions of our magnetization versus applied field [formula] scans (data not shown) are of the order of 1 to 2 mT at 1.8 K.

High field [formula] scans can be used to extract values for Hc2(T). A typical four-quadrant [formula] loop at 1.8 K for a sample with x = 0.38 is shown in Fig. [\ref=Figure2Saghir](a). Two-quadrant [formula] loops at selected temperatures up to Tc for the same sample are shown in Fig. [\ref=Figure2Saghir](b). The [formula] loops all exhibit hysteresis at low fields indicating significant bulk pinning of the flux-line lattice. As the field increases the loops close. At 1.8 K the loop is reversible above 1 T, however, Hc2 in not indicated by this closing of the loop but by a sharp change in slope at 1.31(5) T. The μ0Hc2(T) values for Sn0.62In0.38Te extracted from these data are shown in Fig. [\ref=Figure2Saghir](d). Hc2(T) is fitted using a simple parabolic temperature dependence, [formula], to estimate the zero temperature limit of the upper critical field μ0Hc2(0). The values of μ0Hc2(0) for the x = 0.38 as well as the other compositions are given in Table [\ref=table_of_gapparameters] and range from 1.56(1) T for x = 0.38 to 1.62(1) T for x = 0.45. The Hc2(T) curves for the four samples are later used to correct the values of [formula] determined from the muon spectroscopy data.

Transverse-field muon-spin rotation

TF-μSR asymmetry data were collected at different temperatures for each of the four samples studied. The samples were cooled in fixed transverse-fields of between 5 and 50 mT. Our [formula] data indicate that in these fields, below Tc, the samples are in the mixed state. The temperature was then increased in steps through Tc. At each temperature step a TF-μSR time spectrum containing at least [formula] muon decay events was collected. Figure [\ref=Figure3Saghir] shows the TF-μSR precession signals in 30 mT, collected below and then above Tc for the x = 0.38 and x = 0.45 compositions, and are typical of the data collected during this study.

Figures [\ref=Figure3Saghir](b) and  [\ref=Figure3Saghir](d) show that in the normal state (T > Tc), the signal decays slowly, due to the homogeneous magnetic field distribution throughout the samples. In contrast, Figs. [\ref=Figure3Saghir](a) and  [\ref=Figure3Saghir](c) show that in the superconducting state (T < Tc), the rate at which the asymmetry of the signal is lost is much more rapid, due to the inhomogeneous field distribution arising from the flux-line lattice. The TF-μSR precession data were fitted using an oscillatory decaying Gaussian function,

[formula]

where ω1 and ω2 are the frequencies of the muon precession signal and the background signal respectively, φ is the initial phase offset, and σ is a Gaussian muon-spin relaxation rate. Figures [\ref=Figure4Saghir](a) and  [\ref=Figure4Saghir](b) show the temperature dependence of σ obtained from the TF-μSR data collected in an applied of 30 mT for the x = 0.38 and 0.45 phases of Sn1 - xInxTe.

The relaxation rate σ can be written as [formula], where [formula] is the superconducting contribution to the relaxation rate and [formula] is the nuclear magnetic dipolar contribution which is assumed to be constant over the temperature range of the study. The inset in Fig. [\ref=Figure4Saghir](a) shows the magnetic field dependence of [formula] at 0.30 K for the x = 0.38 sample. The data confirm that the magnetic field dependence of [formula] must be considered when these data are used to extract values of the magnetic penetration depth λ.

At some temperature T < Tc in a superconductor with an upper critical field Bc2(T) that is not many times larger than the internal field B and in which there is a hexagonal Abrikosov vortex lattice, the muon-spin depolarization rate [formula] is related to the penetration depth λ(T) at the same temperature by [\cite=Brandt2003]

[formula]

Therefore, using the values of [formula] from magnetization and [formula] from μSR we have determined the temperature dependence of the London magnetic penetration depth [formula]. The penetration depth [formula] can then be fit within the local London approximation [\cite=Tinkham] [\cite=Prozorov] for an s-wave BCS superconductor in the clean limit using the expression

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fermi function and [formula]. The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by the expression [\cite=Tinkham] [formula].

Alternatively in the dirty limit we have

[formula]

We obtain good fits to the [formula] data for all four samples using both the models discussed above (see Fig. [\ref=Figure5Saghir]). There is little difference between the quality of the fits, as measured by [formula], in the clean and dirty limits. The superconducting parameters, including the magnitude of the gap, Tc, and the penetration depth [formula] at T = 0 K determined from these fits are given in Table [\ref=table_of_gapparameters]. As expected, the magnitudes of the gap in the clean limit are larger than those obtained for the dirty limit (e.g., for x = 0.38 Δ is reduced to 0.66(3) meV in the dirty limit), but in both cases the values obtained place the materials in the intermediate to strong-coupling limit. There is reasonable quantitative agreement between the penetration depths calculated from our μSR measurements and the values of [formula] determined previously from dc magnetic susceptibility data.[\cite=Balakrishnan] The transition temperatures determined from the bulk muon spectroscopy data are systematically lower than those given by the magnetization measurements. This may, in part, be due to the lower applied fields used in the magnetization measurements, and the requirement to establish an inhomogeneous field distribution in order to depolarize the muons. Any small differences between the transition temperatures determined from fits to the [formula] data and those estimated from the [formula] data are due to uncertainties in establishing exactly where [formula] and the determination of [formula] from [formula] data made using Eq. [\ref=BrandtEq].

Plotting [formula] as a function of the reduced temperature, T / Tc, for the different compositions of Sn1 - xInxTe reveals that all the data collected fall on a single universal curve (see inset of Fig. [\ref=Figure5Saghir]). This scaling of the data clearly suggests that in this composition range at least, Sn1 - xInxTe has the same gap symmetry.

We now compare these results with previous work on Sn1 - xInxTe. To date, there have only been a limited number of studies of the bulk superconducting properties of Sn1 - xInxTe for 0.3  ≤  x  ≤  0.5. Low-temperature measurements of the thermal conductivity, κ, for a single crystal of Sn0.6In0.4Te with a Tc of 4.1 K gave a small value for the residual thermal conductivity κ0 / T in zero magnetic field and weak field dependence for this term.[\cite=He] It was argued that this gave strong evidence for a full (nodeless) superconducting gap in the bulk although it was also suggested that the superconducting state was most likely an unconventional odd-parity state. The results are also consistent with estimates of the gap ratio [formula], a measure of the coupling strength, for Sn0.6In0.4Te made using the temperature dependence of the heat capacity [formula] below Tc, although an estimate for the strength of the coupling from the jump in [formula] at Tc gives lower values.[\cite=Balakrishnan]

The results obtained in our study are in line with previous work on more lightly doped Sn1 - xInxTe.[\cite=Erickson] [\cite=Novak] Heat capacity data for Sn1 - xInxTe with 0.02 ≤  x  ≤  0.08 were fitted using a modified BCS theory which allows α to vary.[\cite=Novak] [\cite=Padamsee] For x = 0.025, the hole doping p is less than pc, and Sn1 - xInxTe is fully gapped with α = 1.77 and a Tc of 1.44 K. For slightly higher doping levels (x = 0.04, [formula]cm- 3, Tc = 1.2 K and 0.05 with [formula]cm- 3, Tc = 1.41 K) the fits gave α values of 1.83 and 1.88 respectively which are are larger, but the [formula] data are still well described by a modified BCS model.[\cite=Novak] In an earlier study of materials in this doping regime, estimates of the coupling strength made from heat capacity data collected below Tc also suggested these materials were superconductors with intermediate to strong coupling. However, in the same way as for the more heavily doped Sn0.6In0.4Te, the α values estimated from the jump in [formula] at Tc give weaker coupling values.[\cite=Erickson]

Zero-field muon-spin relaxation

We have also performed ZF-μSR measurements on the x = 0.45 composition of Sn1 - xInxTe in order to search for any (weak) internal magnetism that may arise as a result of ordered magnetic moments, as well as to look for any temperature dependent relaxation processes associated with the onset of superconductivity. [\cite=Aoki] [\cite=Luke] [\cite=Hillier] In these relaxation experiments, any muons stopped in the silver sample holder give a time independent background. The ZF-μSR time spectra at base temperature (0.30 K) and 6 K are shown in Fig. [\ref=Figure6Saghir]. There is no precessional signal, ruling out the possibility of a large internal field and hence long-range magnetic order. These data can be modeled using

[formula]

where the depolarization can be described by the Kubo-Toyabe function, [\cite=Hayano]

[formula]

where A0 is the initial asymmetry, [formula] is the background, [formula] is the relaxation rate associated with the nuclear moments and Λ is the electronic relaxation rate. The fits yield the parameters shown in Table [\ref=ZF_table_of_fits] that to within error are the same above and below Tc, confirming the qualitative view that there are no changes in the form of the data with temperature. Note that fits with Λ fixed at zero also gave values for A0, [formula], and [formula] above and below Tc that agree to within error.

The behavior observed in the ZF-μSR data, and the values of [formula] extracted from the fits, are commensurate with the presence of random local fields arising from the nuclear moments within the samples that are static on the time scale of the muon precession. There is no evidence for any additional relaxation channels that may be associated with more exotic electronic phenomena such as the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. [\cite=Aoki] [\cite=Luke] [\cite=Hillier]

SUMMARY

We have performed μSR and magnetization studies on bulk polycrystalline samples of Sn1 - xInxTe for 0.38  ≤  x  ≤  0.45. The materials are all bulk superconductors with Tc increasing with x up to a maximum of around 4.80 K for x = 0.45. The upper critical fields are estimated to be [formula] T in this doping range. Magnetization versus field loops indicate bulk pinning in low applied fields while the response is close to reversible in applied fields close to Hc2. There is no evidence in these materials either for long-range magnetic order or for any unusual electronic behavior in the superconducting state. Our μSR results also confirm that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in this system. The absolute values of the magnetic penetration depth [formula] lie in the range 500 to 580 nm. The temperature dependence of λ for Sn1 - xInxTe in this doping range can be adequately described using a single isotropic s-wave gap; bulk Sn1 - xInxTe appears to be fully gapped superconductor. The magnitude of the superconducting gap ratio α for all four samples suggest that these are intermediate to strong-coupling superconductors.
