An Intrinsic Way to Control E-Sail Spin

Nomenclature

Introduction

The electric solar wind sail (E-sail) uses charged tethers to tap momentum from the solar wind (SW) [\cite=paper1]. The baseline configuration uses a set of radial main tethers which are kept under centrifugal tension by spinning the system [\cite=paper9]. For dynamical stability, the tips of the main tethers are connected together by auxiliary tethers [\cite=paper9]. For each tether, the generated E-sail thrust points along the tether-perpendicular component of the SW flow direction. Thrust vectoring is thereby possible by inclining the sail (the tether spin plane) with respect to the SW flow (Fig. [\ref=fig:3D]). For each tether, the magnitude of the thrust can be controlled by modulating the voltage of the tether, and sail attitude maneuvers are possible by E-sail force only.

If the E-sail spacecraft orbits the Sun while having its sail inclined, the orbital Coriolis acceleration interacts in a nontrivial way with the spin of the tether rig [\cite=paper14]. Specifically, the spin rate accelerates (decelerates) if the sail is inclined so as to spiral the orbit outwards (inwards) in the solar system. The angular acceleration of the rotating sail is approximately given by

[formula]

where the sail inclination angle α is taken to be positive if the sail accelerates away from the sun (i.e. if the E-sail thrust component along the orbital velocity vector is positive). Equation [\ref=eq:angacc] leads to exponential change of ω unless compensated by spin rate control.

The E-sail also needs spin rate control to generate angular momentum during deployment of the tethers. Cold gas thrusters and ionic liquid field effect electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters have been prototyped for spin rate control yielding RemoteUnit mass of 0.56 kg [\cite=D412], and solar photonic blades have been considered at lower technical readiness level (TRL) [\cite=paper16]. Here we propose a new intrinsic method of controlling the spin rate by the E-sail force itself.

Spin rate modulation by electrified auxtethers

Consider an E-sail as in Fig. [\ref=fig:3D] where now the auxiliary tethers (auxtethers) can at least partly be put under voltage. A segment of auxtether generates E-sail thrust which is perpendicular to it if one neglects end effects. We now want to show that if the auxtether voltage can be controlled independently from the adjacent maintether voltage, pure E-sail spin rate control becomes possible.

Figure [\ref=fig:Principle]a shows an E-sail inclined at angle α to the SW flow and one of its charged maintethers which at the moment happens to lie in the XZ plane i.e. in the plane of the figure. At this moment the maintether in question generates thrust vector [formula] which is perpendicular to the tether spinplane (dashed line), i.e. inclined by angle α with respect to the SW.

Figure [\ref=fig:Principle]b shows the same maintether a quarter cycle later when it is aligned along Y axis. Now the maintether is already perpendicular to the SW so that the thrust [formula] is simply aligned with the SW. [formula] can be decomposed into spinplane component [formula] and spinplane normal component [formula]. The spinplane component of the E-sail thrust tends to decrease the tether's ω when it climbs upstream. The reverse happens half a cycle later when the tether moves downstream so that overall no change in spin rate is generated.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:Principle]c there is a short charged auxtether segment attached to the tip of the maintether at the same moment as in [\ref=fig:Principle]b. The E-sail thrust vector [formula] is now a vector sum of the maintether thrust and the auxtether thrust. The maintether thrust is along the SW flow as in [\ref=fig:Principle]b, but the auxtether thrust is perpendicular to the auxtether, i.e. perpendicular to the spin plane. As a result, [formula] is not fully aligned with the SW and its spinplane component Fs is smaller. To prevent the sail from turning, it is necessary that Fn has the same value when the tether is moving upstream and downstream. However, the spinplane component Fs can be different because the same Fn can be obtained by different combinations of the maintether and auxtether voltages. Effectively, we have two control parameters (maintether voltage and auxtether voltage) which allows us to control the two thrust parameters Fs and Fn freely. By having the same Fn but different Fs in the upstream and downstream portions of the maintether's cycle, one can modify the sail's spin rate while keeping its orientation fixed.

Effect strength

Consider an E-sail consisting of N maintethers of length R, approximating each by a point mass m located at the tip so that m contains the masses of the maintether, the Remote Unit and the associated auxtether segment. Assume that the E-sail thrust per unit length f at solar distance r0 (select r0  =  1 au for definiteness) is f0. At other distances r, f  =  f0(r0 / r) [\cite=paper9]. Assume also that at each solar distance r the spin rate ω is chosen such that the centrifugal tension of the maintether is k times the E-sail force acting on it where one typically requires [formula] for stability. This implies mRω2  =  kfR so that

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:angacc]) gives the secular angular acceleration due to the orbital Coriolis effect. The corresponding Coriolis torque is

[formula]

Thus, Eq. ([\ref=eq:tauc]) gives the torque that must be compensated by the electrified auxtether E-sail effect.

Consider the tether when it's pointed along Y (Fig. [\ref=fig:Principle]b,c) where the length of its associated auxtether segment is [formula]. If the maintether has voltage and the auxtether has not, the E-sail thrust acting on the maintether is F  =  fR whose components are Fs  =  F sin α and Fn  =  F cos α. If both tethers have voltage, then Fs  =  gfR sin α and [formula] where g is a dimensionless factor by which the maintether voltage is modulated (0  ≤  g  ≤  1). Requiring that Fn causes the same torque in both cases implies

[formula]

and the difference in spin axis aligned torques becomes

[formula]

Let us assume that the auxtether voltage is used only when the tether is close to vertical, in phase angle interval of length δφ, so that the average E-sail torque due to auxtether electrification is [formula]. Requiring [formula] we can solve for δφ. Using above definitions, the result can be expressed as

[formula]

where Ω0 is the orbital angular frequency at r = r0: Ω  =  Ω0(r0 / r)3 / 2. For example for the baseline 1 N E-sail orbiting at 1 au N = 100, k = 5, r = r0, [formula] s- 1, m = 1 kg, and f0 = 500 nN/m so that [formula]. This is a conveniently small fraction of the full circle, hence there is typically an abundant performance margin that can be used e.g. for running the auxtethers at reduced voltage or for having only part of the auxtether being conductive.

Conclusion

In many missions the orbital Coriolis effect causes a secular variation of the E-sail spin rate which must be compensated by technical means. We showed conceptually that this can be effected by making the auxtethers partly or completely from conducting material and having a way to control their voltages. The resulting pure E-sail concept does not need any auxiliary propulsion systems such as cold gas thrusters, FEEP thrusters or photonic blades for its long-term spin rate management.

In the future, more refined engineering studies should be carried out concerning conducting auxtether designs and the voltage regulation mechanisms of the auxtethers. One should also study the details of how the proposed scheme can be used for angular momentum generation during tether deployment.
