Comment on Temperature dependent fluctuations in the two-dimensional XY model

In [\cite=PML], the temperature dependence of the probability density function (PDF) of the magnetization (the order parameter) was first shown by numerical Monte Carlo analysis using the finite 2D XY model. This result contradicted the previous claims found in the literature [\cite=BFHPPPS]. Recently, [\cite=BB] shows semi-analytically that the PDF depends on the system temperature T. To show this dependence the authors compute the contribution of the multi loop graphs (MLG) to the moments of the PDF within the Harmonic approximation of the XY model. They show that the MLG depend on T and may not be neglected in the thermodynamic limit contrary to previous assumptions [\cite=BFHPPPS]. Using a Monte Carlo simulation they compute the skewness γ3 or normalized third moment of the PDF, which provides a clear measure of the variation of the PFD with temperature , and using a Monte Carlo simulation, obtain the numerically approximated expression for γ3, valid for a square lattice of lattice size L = 16,

They also obtained for the lattice size L = 32 a value much closer to the theory with γ3(T)   ≈   - 0.88 + 0.15T, and finally argued that the skewness is relatively computational expensive due to the need for averaging and, as their results appear to confirm the evolution of γ3 with T, they ... leave the determination of the precise form of γ3(T) from larger systems to another time .

This comment is devoted first to show that an explicit analytical expression for γ3(T), valid for arbitrary system size and to all orders in T, can be deduced starting from their equation (11) for the higher moments 〈mp〉 of the PDF, and second to show that the numerical values of the slope of γ3 reported in their paper are not just numerically incorrect, but their scaling with the lattice size is wrong.

Starting from their equation (11) and using the translational invariance of the lattice propagator G, the exact expression for the moments to all orders in T can be obtained, yielding:

[formula]

where Λ denotes the lattice, N = L2 is the volume and the lattice propagator G is given for example by its Fourier representation [formula] is the lattice momentum defined as usual as (KL)i  = 2 sin (Ki / 2) with i = 1,2 and Ki lies in the first Brillouin zone. We now use the definition of the skewness as the third normalized moment [formula] and write

[formula]

and explicitly expanding up to order T, we obtain

[formula]

where the quantities gn are defined in terms of the power n of the lattice propagator G as gn = Gn(0) / Nn - 1. The expression of eqn. ([\ref=skewness]) agrees with the corresponding equation (33) of ref. [\cite=MPV], where the skewness and kurtosis are computed for the full 2D XY-model up to two-loops, including the anharmonic corrections to the Hamiltonian (see the two last terms in eqn. (33)), which are suppressed by a volume factor N, and which are negligible in the thermodynamic limit but are relevant for finite lattice sizes. Higher order corrections in T can be directly computed along the lines outlined here. From the numerical point of view, we use the known numerical values for the lattice coefficients gn, which are directly and easily evaluated by using MATLAB for example, and obtain γ3(T)   ≈   - 0.8540 + 0.1358T for L = 16 and γ3(T)   ≈   - 0.8763 + 0.1331T for L = 32 respectively. Independent of the numerical differences found for the first two coefficients of the skewness, one observes that the values for the slope (linear term in T) reported in [\cite=BB] increases with the system size, contrary to the tendency of the analytic expression displayed by eqn. ([\ref=skewness]). In fact, the slope is a decreasing function of the system size and its thermodynamic limit converges to the value 0.1319. Finally, and in order to compare our results with the accurate numerical values obtained in [\cite=MPV] for the skewness, we evaluate the contribution obtained from the anharmonic corrections

and obtain δγ3(T)  ≈  0.0197T for L = 16 and δγ3(T)  ≈  0.0191T for L = 32 respectively . Perfect agreement is found with the corresponding value in [\cite=MPV], (see eqn.( 36)), when adding this contribution to the value obtained in eqn. ([\ref=skewness]) for γ3(T).
