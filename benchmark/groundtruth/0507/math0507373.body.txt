Operator Amenability of Fourier-Stieltjes algebras, II

Introduction

History and context

Let G be a locally compact group, and let [formula] and [formula] denote its group and measure algebra, respectively. In [\cite=eymard], P. Eymard introduced the Fourier algebra [formula] and the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra [formula] of G. In the framework of Kac algebras [\cite=enockschwartz], [formula] and [formula] as well as [formula] and [formula] can be viewed as dual to one another: this duality generalizes the well known dual group construction for abelian groups.

It is a now classical theorem of B. E. Johnson [\cite=johnsonM] that [formula] is amenable if and only if G is an amenable group. On the other hand, [formula] is an amenable Banach algebra only if G has an abelian subgroup of finite index [\cite=forrestr] [\cite=runde]. In order to obtain the appropriate statement dual to Johnson's theorem, we first need to recognize that [formula]--as the predual of the von Neumann algebra [formula]--is canonically equipped with an operator space structure. In [\cite=ruan], Z.-J. Ruan modified Johnson's notion of Banach algebraic amenability from [\cite=johnsonM] by considering only completely bounded module actions and derivations and obtained the notion of operator amenability. Since [formula] is abelian, the canonical operator space structure of [formula] is [formula], so all bounded maps from [formula] are automatically completely bounded; consequently, [formula] is operator amenable if and only if it is amenable. As the predual of the group von Neumann algebra [formula], the Fourier algebra [formula] also carries a natural operator space structure, and in [\cite=ruan], Ruan showed that [formula] is operator amenable if and only if G is amenable. We further note that Johnson [\cite=johnson91] proved that [formula] is always weakly amenable (see [\cite=despicg] for a simpler proof) whereas [formula] is known to be weakly amenable only if G if the component of the identity is abelian [\cite=forrestr]. On the other hand, [formula] is always operator weakly amenable [\cite=spronk] [\cite=samei1] [\cite=samei2].

The questions for which G the measure algebra [formula] is amenable or weakly amenable, respectively, were eventually settled by H. G. Dales, F. Ghahramani and A. Ya. Helemskii [\cite=dalesgh]: [formula] is amenable if and only if G is discrete and amenable, and it is weakly amenable if and only if G is discrete. In abelian group duality--and more generally in Kac algebra theory--, the property dual to discreteness is compactness. Thus, parallel to the [formula]-[formula] situation, one is led to expect that [formula] is operator (weakly) amenable if and only if G is compact, as was conjectured in both [\cite=rundes] and [\cite=spronk] (see also [\cite=helemskii]). In fact, it was shown in [\cite=rundes] that [formula] is operator amenable with operator amenability constant C < 5 if and only if G is compact. At the time [\cite=rundes] was written, the authors felt that the condition imposed on the amenability constant was unnecessary.

In the present article, we refute our previous conjecture by exhibiting examples of non-compact groups G for which [formula] is operator amenable. Moreover, we show that the operator amenability constant of [formula] for those G is precisely 5: this shows that the estimate for this constant from [\cite=rundes] cannot be improved. All of our examples, which are taken from work by L. Bagget [\cite=bagget] and G. Mauceri and M. A. Picardello [\cite=maucerip], are separable Fell groups with countable dual spaces.

The groups G for which [formula] is amenable were characterized in [\cite=forrestr]: they are precisely those compact G with an abelian subgroup of finite index. In analogy with the corresponding result for [formula], one might conjecture that [formula] is weakly amenable exactly when G is compact with an abelian connected component of the identity. Our examples show that that this natural conjecture is false too.

Furthermore, we establish some amenability results for the spine [formula] of [formula], which was introduced and studied by M. Ilie and the second-named author in [\cite=ilies1].

Definitions and notation

The Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes algebra, [formula] and [formula], of a locally compact group G were introduced in [\cite=eymard]. the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra [formula] is the space of all coefficient functions of weakly operator continuous unitary representations on Hilbert spaces, i.e., [formula], where ΣG denotes the class of such representations. Using direct sums and tensor products of representations, it can be verified that [formula] is an algebra of functions. Moreover, [formula] is the dual space of the enveloping [formula]-algebra of G, and under this norm is, in fact, a Banach algebra. The left regular representation [formula] is defined through left translation on the space of square integrable functions with respect to left Haar measure. The Fourier algebra [formula] is the space of all coefficients of [formula], and is a closed ideal in [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is the predual of the enveloping von Neumann algebra, [formula], and [formula] is the predual of the group von Neumann algebra, [formula].

In its capacity as the predual of [formula], [formula] is an operator space by [\cite=blecher]. Our standard reference for operator spaces and completely bounded maps is [\cite=effrosrB]. Taking the adjoint of the multiplication map [formula], one obtains a [formula]-homomorphism--and thus a complete contraction--[formula], where [formula] denotes the von Neumann tensor product. Consequently, m0 extends to a complete contraction [formula], where [formula] stands for the operator space projective tensor product [\cite=blecherp] [\cite=effrosr]. All in all, [formula] a completely contractive Banach algebra. It is clear that every closed subalgebra of [formula]--such as [formula]--is also a completely contractive Banach algebra. Note that that [formula] is canonically completely isometrically isomorphic to a closed subspace of [formula], and that [formula] holds completely isometrically isomorphically [\cite=effrosr].

If [formula] is a completely contractive Banach algebra, a completely bounded [formula]-bimodule is an operator space [formula], which is a module for which the module maps [formula] and [formula] extend to completely bounded maps [formula] and [formula]. Dual modules of completely bounded [formula]-bimodules with the dual space operator space structure and the dual action are also completely bounded [formula]-bimodules. A completely contractive Banach algebra [formula] is said to be operator amenable if, for every completely bounded [formula]-bimodule [formula], every completely bounded derivation [formula] is inner.

The concept of a bounded approximate diagonal can be readily adapted from the Banach algebra context [\cite=johnson72] to the operator space setting: a completely contractive Banach algebra is amenable if, and only if, it admits a completely bounded approximate diagonal, i.e., a bounded net [formula] in [formula] for which

[formula]

for each [formula], where [formula] and [formula] for [formula], and [formula] is the multiplication map. We say that [formula] has operator amenability constant C, or is C-operator amenable, if C is the largest number for which [formula] for any completely bounded approximate diagonal. (This notion is again adapted from the corresponding notion for Banach algebras, which was developed in [\cite=johnson94] specifically to address non-amenability of Fourier algebras for certain compact groups.)

Following [\cite=badecd], we say that a (completely contractive) commutative Banach algebra [formula] is (operator) weakly amenable if every (completely) bounded derivation [formula] into a (completely) bounded symmetric bimodule--i.e., satisfying [formula] for [formula] and [formula]--is zero.

Some operator amenable Fourier-Stieltjes algebras

For any prime number p, let [formula] denote the field of p-adic numbers, which is a locally compact field. It is defined to be the completion of the rational numbers [formula] by the p-adic valuation |  ·  |p, which is a multiplicative, non-Archimedian valuation, i.e., satisfies |rs|p = |r|p|s|p and |r + s|p  ≤   max {|r|p,|s|p} for [formula]. We then let [formula], the p-adic integers, which is a compact open subring of [formula]. The multiplicative group of [formula] is [formula]. The family of sets [formula] forms a basis of neighborhoods of 0, so that [formula] is totally disconnected.

Let [formula] denote the multiplicative group of [formula] matrices with entries in [formula] and determinant of valuation 1. This compact group acts on the vector space [formula] by matrix multiplication, and we set

[formula]

For n = 1, this is the group [formula] of [\cite=bagget]. It is reasonable to call Gp,n the "nth rigid p-adic motion group".

In [\cite=maucerip], it was shown--using the "Mackey machine"--that the dual space of [formula]--the set of all (equivalence classes) of irreducible continuous unitary representations of Gp,n--is countable. In fact each group Gp,n is of the form [formula] where

K is a compact group acting on an abelian group A, with each of the groups separable, and

the dual space [formula] is countable and decomposes as [formula] where [formula] is the discrete dual space of K, q:G  →  K is the quotient map, and each [formula] is a subrepresentation of the left regular representation.

The following was proven for Gp,1 independently in [\cite=mauceri] and [\cite=walter]. A proof for general Gp,n can be obtained in a similar way. For the reader's convenience, we give a proof for general groups of the form [formula] satisfying (1) and (2).

For [formula] as above, [formula] holds.

Let [formula], so that [formula] for some [formula] and [formula]. By [\cite=taylor] and (2) above, π is totally decomposable. We may thus write we write

[formula]

where [formula] and βk are multiplicity constants. For [formula] and [formula], let [formula] and Pk denote the orthogonal projection associated with [formula] and [formula], respectively. We then obtain for s∈G that

[formula]

By [\cite=arsac], which uses standard von Neumann algebra techniques, this is an [formula]-direct sum, i.e.,

[formula]

Each [formula] lies in [formula], and each [formula] belongs to [formula]. All in all, we see that u = u1 + u2 with [formula], where [formula] and [formula].

Since [formula] and Gp,n are both disconnected, it follows from [\cite=forrest], that [formula] and [formula] are both generated by idempotents. Hence, it follows from Proposition [\ref=KAprop] that [formula] is generated by idempotents as well.

From the remarks following the proof of [\cite=badecd], we thus obtain:

For each [formula], the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra [formula] is weakly amenable.

Since weak amenability implies operator weak amenability, Corollary [\ref=wacor] already shows that--contrary to what one might expect in view of [\cite=dalesgh]--there are non-compact, locally compact groups with an operator weakly amenable Fourier-Stieltjes algebra.

We shall now see that [formula] is even operator amenable. In fact, we will work again in the slightly more general setting of Proposition [\ref=KAprop].

For [formula] as in Proposition [\ref=KAprop], [formula] is operator amenable with operator amenability constant 5.

This proof is adapted from [\cite=johnson96].

Since K and [formula] are amenable groups, it follows from (an inspection of) [\cite=ruan] that [formula] and [formula] are each 1-operator amenable. Let [formula] be a norm 1 completely bounded approximate diagonal for [formula] and let (vβ)β∈B be such for [formula]. Since K is compact, we can arrange for vβ(k,k) = 1 for all k∈K. Again, [formula] denotes the completely contractive multiplication map.

Let [formula] be the product directed set [\cite=kelley], let [formula] for each [formula], and, for each [formula] in Γ, set

[formula]

Since

[formula]

by [\cite=rundes], we see that

[formula]

for each [formula].

We shall now verify that [formula] is a completely bounded approximate diagonal for [formula].

We first check that [formula] is asymptotically central for the right and left module actions. For [formula], we have

[formula]

which can be made arbitrarily small for sufficiently large [formula] and [formula]. For [formula], we have

[formula]

which can be made arbitrarily small for sufficiently large choices of β. For general [formula] with [formula] and [formula], it is thus clear that [formula] can be made arbitrarily small for sufficiently large [formula].

Next, we check that [formula] is an approximate identity for [formula]. Note that, for [formula] we have

[formula]

For [formula], we then obtain

[formula]

because [formula] for each [formula] as [formula]. A similar calculation shows that [formula] for [formula].

Consequently, (wγ)γ∈Γ is indeed a completely bounded approximate diagonal for [formula], so that the operator amenability constant C of [formula] can at most be 5. Since G is not compact, C < 5 cannot occur by [\cite=rundes]. Hence, C  =  5 must hold.

The operator amenability of [formula] in Theorem [\ref=theo:fsalgopamen] can easily be obtained by observing that [formula] is an operator amenable ideal in [formula] with operator amenable quotient [formula] and then applying the operator space analog of [\cite=rundeB]. The disadvantage in doing this, however, is that it yields no information on the operator amenability constant of [formula].

In [\cite=rundes], we introduced, for an arbitrary locally compact group G, a decomposition [formula], which can be interpreted as dual to the decomposition of [formula] into the discrete and the continuous measures. For non-discrete G, it is well known that there are continuous measures in [formula], and we conjectured that, at least for amenable G, the inclusion [formula] is proper unless G is compact [\cite=rundes]. Theorem [\ref=theo:fsalgopamen] shows that this conjecture is false.

Operator amenability of the spine

The spine of [formula]

The main theorem of the previous section is actually a particular case of a more general result. The groups Gp,n are all non-compact amenable groups for which [formula] holds, where [formula] is the spine of [formula] as defined in [\cite=ilies1]. In this section, we study amenability properties for spines.

We recall the definition of the spine of a Fourier-Stieltjes algebra [formula] of a locally compact group G below. Full details are presented in the article [\cite=ilies1].

Let Tnq(G) denote the family of all group topologies τ on G with the following properties:

The completion Gτ of G with respect to the left uniformity generated by τ is a locally compact group. (This completion is unique up to homeomorphic isomorphism, and it is the same completion as gained from the right uniformity.)

If τap is the coarsest topology making the almost periodic compactification map η:G  →  Gap continuous, then τ  ⊇  τap.

We call such topologies non-quotient locally precompact topologies. The family Tnq(G) is a semilattice, i.e., a commutative, idempotent semigroup, under the operation [formula], where [formula] is the coarsest topology which is simultaneously finer than both τ1 and τ2. In particular, this semilattice is unital with unit τap.

For each τ∈Tnq(G) we let ητ:G  →  Gτ be the natural map into the completion. Then the Fourier algebra [formula] is completely isometrically isomorphic to the subalgebra [formula] of [formula]. We have that [formula] if [formula] and [formula] for [formula] (j = 1,2), in this case. The spine is then the algebra

[formula]

which is graded over Tnq(G), i.e., [formula] for [formula] (j = 1,2).

As in [\cite=ilies1], we can calculate that Tnq(Gp,n) = {τap,τp,n} for any of the groups Gp,n, where τp,n is the given topology on Gp,n. Moreover, the quotient map [formula] is the almost periodic compactification map. Consequently, [formula] holds.

Operator amenability of [formula]

For our discussion of the operator amenability of [formula], we introduce some auxiliary notation. For any F  ⊆  Tnq(G), let 〈F〉 denote the sublattice of Tnq(G) it generates, and define

[formula]

Note that, if F  ⊆  Tnq(G) is finite, then so is 〈F〉.

Since Tnq(G) is finite for each of the groups Gp,n, the following lemma extends (the qualitative part of) Theorem [\ref=theo:fsalgopamen].

Let G be an amenable, locally compact group, and let F  ⊆  Tnq(G) be finite. Then [formula] is operator amenable.

We shall prove that [formula] is amenable by using induction on |F|.

Suppose that |F|  =  1, so that F = {τ} for some τ∈Tnq(G). Since G is amenable, so is Gτ by [\cite=rundeB], which implies that [formula] is operator amenable by [\cite=ruan].

Now suppose that |F| > 1. Fix τ∈F, let [formula], and set

[formula]

where [formula]. Then IF,τ is an ideal in [formula] containing [formula] as an ideal. Since [formula] is operator amenable by the induction hypothesis, and since [formula] is either [formula] or {0}, we conclude from the completely bounded analogue of [\cite=rundeB] that Iτ,F is operator amenable. Since [formula] and [formula] is operator amenable by induction hypothesis, a similar argument yields the operator amenability of [formula].

It is immediate from Proposition [\ref=spineprop] that [formula] is operator amenable if G is amenable and Tnq(G) is finite. We shall see that these are the only conditions under which [formula] can be operator amenable.

For the the following lemma, note that, by linearity and continuity, the product of Tnq(G) extends to [formula] turning it into a Banach algebra. Since the canonical operator space structure of [formula] is [formula], this Banach algebra is canonically completely contractive.

Let G be a locally compact group. Then the map

[formula]

is a complete quotient map and an algebra homomorphism.

Note that [formula] is the dual space of [formula]. For each τ∈Tnq(G), let [formula] be the central projection corresponding to the identity element of [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a normal [formula]-monomorphism and the adjoint of Π. This show that Π is indeed a complete quotient map.

To see that Π is multiplicative, let τ1,τ2∈Tnq(G), and let [formula] for j  =  1,2. It follows that [formula] and thus

[formula]

By linearity and continuity, this proves the multiplicativity of Π.

Let G be a locally compact group. Then [formula] is operator amenable if and only if G is amenable and Tnq(G) is finite.

The "if" part is provided by Proposition [\ref=spineprop].

For the "only if" part, suppose that [formula] is operator amenable. The central projection [formula] corresponding to the identity operator in [formula] forms a completely contractive projection onto [formula] via the predual action, [formula]. Thus [formula] is a completely complemented ideal in [formula] and hence is operator amenable by the completely bounded analog of [\cite=rundeB]. Therefore, by [\cite=ruan], G is amenable.

Since [formula] is operator amenable, so is its quotient [formula], and since the canonical operator space structure of [formula] is [formula], it follows that [formula] is amenable in the purely Banach algebraic sense. From [\cite=gronbaek], we conclude that Tnq(G) is finite.

Using computations from [\cite=ilies1], we obtain that [formula] is operator amenable for G being any one of the following groups: the real numbers [formula], the integers [formula], the Euclidean motion groups [formula] for [formula], the ax + b group, or [formula], where p is any prime. On the other hand, the spine fails to be operator amenable for any of the groups [formula] or [formula] with n  ≥  2, for [formula] as a discrete group, and for any non-amenable group.

For any locally compact group G, let [formula] denote the closed ideal of [formula] consisting of functions vanishing at ∞  . For the Euclidean motion groups, it is known (see, for example, the discussion on [\cite=chou]) that [formula]. We suspect that [formula] is never operator amenable when it is properly larger than [formula] (see [\cite=figatalamanca] for situations in which this is known to be the case). This would entail that [formula] cannot be operator amenable.

In view of Theorems [\ref=theo:fsalgopamen] and [\ref=spinethm], we a prepared to make the conjecture that, for a locally compact group G, the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra [formula] is operator amenable if and only if [formula], G is amenable, and Tnq(G) is finite.

We note:

Let G be a locally compact group. Then [formula] is amenable if and only if G has an abelian subgroup group of finite index and Tnq(G) is finite.

If [formula] is amenable, it is operator amenable, so that Tnq(G) must be finite. Since [formula] is a complemented ideal of [formula], it must be amenable, too. Hence, G has an abelian subgroup of finite index by [\cite=forrestr] [\cite=runde].

Operator weak amenability of [formula]

In contrast to Theorem [\ref=spinethm], we have the following:

Let G be a locally compact group G. Then [formula] is operator weakly amenable.

Let [formula] be an completely bounded symmetric [formula]-bimodule, and let [formula] be a completely bounded derivation. Then

[formula]

holds. Since [formula] is operator weakly amenable by [\cite=spronk], it follows that [formula] for each τ∈Tnq(G) and thus D  =  0.

It is not clear at all for which locally compact groups G, the spine [formula] might be weakly amenable (in the original Banach algebraic sense). The spine is weakly amenable for any compact group with an abelian connected component of the identity by [\cite=forrestr] and also for any of the groups Gp,n by Corollary [\ref=wacor]. However, there are compact groups K for which [formula] is not weakly amenable [\cite=johnson94]. If we let G be any discrete group for which Gap admits such a group K as a quotient, then [formula] appears not to be weakly amenable. Indeed, [formula] is a quotient of [formula]. Furthermore [formula] contains an isometric copy of [formula]. Thus, it appears unlikely that [formula] is weakly amenable, and we conjecture the same for [formula].
