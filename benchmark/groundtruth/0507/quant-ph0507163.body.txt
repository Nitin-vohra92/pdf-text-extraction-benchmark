Quantum Computation Beyond the "Standard Circuit Model"

The "Standard Circuit Model"

The "standard circuit model" is an established proposal to implement quantum gates in quantum computation [\cite=Barenco95]. In this model essential is the notion of the universal gate [\cite=Deutsch85]. Thus, any given quantum gate (any given unitary transformation of the quantum system that implements the quantum computer) can be analyzed using a set of basic gates, known as universal gates. The selection of the set of universal gates is not unique [\cite=Lloyd95]. One-qubit gates can be analyzed using only Hadamard and phase gates. Two-qubit gates can be analyzed using Hadamard, phase and the CNOT gate and this is generalized in the case of N-qubit gates, while it was noted that in the general case an infinite number of steps are needed to perform a gate explicitly [\cite=Deutch95].

In the "standard circuit model", physical systems are neglected if they cannot copy easily the model (if someone cannot perform easily one of the selected universal gates). Also, neither the number of computational steps nor the total time to perform computation are optimal [\cite=Sproel05].

Quantum Control Theory

In quantum control theory, the generalization of the control theory in quantum systems, a system is said to be controllable if an arbitrary Lie group element W∈SU(2N) can be decomposed in finite time as

[formula]

where [formula] are generators of the corresponding su(2N) Lie algebra and [formula]. In the case of quantum computation, W is equivalent with an arbitrary unitary transformation (up to a global phase) so it is equivalent with an arbitrary N-qubit gate. J(k) corresponds to the Hamiltonians describing the system under consideration while ai are equivalent with time parameters ti. The controllability on Lie groups from a mathematical point of view was studied in [\cite=JurSus75] [\cite=Rama95] [\cite=Khaneja01] [\cite=SchFuSo01]. This direct relation between the problem of controllability in Lie groups and the problem of universal quantum computation allows us to approach quantum computation with an alternative way beyond the "standard circuit model". In this approach if the selected Hamiltonians [formula] form a complete set of operators, then every W∈SU(2N) can be exactly realized using a finite number of steps, although this number of steps is not fixed, where in the case of the "standard circuit model" the same element SU(2N) could be approximately realized using an infinitely number of steps. The order of generation (the number of computational steps required to perform an arbitrary N-qubit gate) is available for arbitrary Hamiltonians only in the case of the SU(2) group (one-qubit gates) via the Lowental's criterion [\cite=Lowenthal72]. In this case, only two Hamiltonians [formula] are sufficient to form a complete set. If the Hamiltonians are orthogonal, i.e. Trace(J1J2) = 0, then three at most steps are required, to realizing any W∈SU(2)). When Trace(J1J2)  ≠  0, the number of steps are given by the Lowental's criterion, but the algorithm to obtain the solution is not known.

In the case of higher order groups there is an analysis based on the Cartan decomposition of the su(2N) algebras [\cite=Khaneja01]. This analysis provides also an analytical way of calculating the corresponding time parameters (Euler angles) in the case of the SU(4) (2-qubit gates). On the same spirit is the proposal for exact computation by Whaley and collaborators [\cite=Zhang03]. Open problems in Lie groups controllability are:

SU(2) group (one-qubit gates). An algorithm which, given an arbitrary couple of generators-Hamiltonians, will be able to provide analytically the time parameters to perform universal computation, if the number of required steps are more than three.

Higher order groups. A criterion for minimum number of steps to generate an arbitrary element of the group (which corresponds to an arbitrary N-qubit gate, respectively) in the case where the generators-Hamiltonians are not orthogonal. Algorithms to evaluate the corresponding time parameters.

Quantum Gates Using the Intrinsic Abilities of a Physical System

The main points of our proposal can be summarized briefly as follows

Instead of forcing a physical system to act as a predetermined set of universal gates we focus on the ability of the physical system to act as a quantum computer using only its natural available interactions (encoded universality [\cite=DiVincenzo00]).

Construction of any given gate and algorithm in terms of a minimal configuration and computational procedure.

Minimized finite number of steps, evolving in time according to a finite number of basic, intrinsic Hamiltonians, controlled by a minimal finite number of classical switches (the selection of the switches is not unique).

Implementation does not depend on the psecific system used as a qubit. Several solid state proposals as charge Josephson junctions, SQUIDs, quantum dots have been tested but our proposal can be extended to NMR quantum computation, trapped ions etc in order to test it with various physical systems described by different Hamiltonians and interactions.

This computer consists of one cell controlled by external binary switches and evolving in time using these switches. Quantum gates and algorithms are translated into manipulation of these switches. It is a simple device which overcomes the notion of transposition from classical circuits and does not have any "quantum" connections (one of the difficult parts in physical implementation-especially in solid state devices).

The above proposal is based in the following mathematical Propositions:

A number of N + 1 switches are sufficient for universal quantum computation in a N-qubit device.

A set of N + 2 Hamiltonians provided by the basic Hamiltonian of the N-qubit device through appropriate tuning of the N + 1 switches, can generate the su(2N) algebra.

The construction scheme of any quantum gate consists of a finite number of steps evolving in time according to a finite number of basic Hamiltonians (reiterating in cyclic pattern) and provided by proper switches' manipulation.

[formula]

It is an open conjecture that every U can be generated exactly by O(4N) steps.

The manipulations of the quantum computer can be codified by a rudimentary Quantum Machine Language [\cite=Chatzisavvas03].

Results

One-qubit gates

According to the "standard model" the most usual analysis of an arbitrary one-qubit gate includes two Hadamard gates and two phase gates.

Even if both Hadamard and phase gate can be realized in one computational step, then at least four steps are required to perform universal quantum computation. Usually decompositions of elementary one-qubit gates require at least 8 computational steps according to this analysis and it is performed most of the times in systems which provide us with orthogonal Hamiltonians.

With the presented computational scheme the results in the case of the one-qubit gates are the following:

Orthogonal Hamiltonians If the Hamiltonians are orthogonal, i.e. (H1,H2) = Trace(H1H2) = 0, then two Hamiltonians and three computational steps at most are required, to realize any W∈SU(2).

[formula]

For example in the case of NMR (where orthogonal Hamiltonians are used) we can perform universal quantum computation within three computational steps, while the analytical solutions for the time parameters are the trivial Euler angles.

Non-Orthogonal Hamiltonians If the Hamiltonians are non-orthogonal i.e. (H1,H2) = Trace(H1H2)  ≠  0, the number of steps-the order of generation is n = k + 2, given by the Lowental's criterion

[formula]

and the corresponding construction scheme is the following

[formula]

For example in the case of the charge Josephson junctions where the general Hamiltonian is [formula] manipulation of the bias energy Ec which is controlled by the binary switch of gate voltage Vg, provides the following non-orthogonal Hamiltonians

[formula]

The pair {H1,H2} generates the su(2) algebra but since Trace(H1H2)  ≠  0 the whole SU(2) group cannot be cover in 3 steps.

The Lowenthal's parameter ψ is

[formula]

If x is small enough, then [formula] and every element of the SU(2) group [formula] (one-qubit gate), can be constructed in 4 steps at most. The corresponding analytical solutions in that case are

[formula]

[formula]

Two qubit gates

Analysis according to the "standard circuit model" requires at least 5 Hamiltonians and 19 computational steps and and it is performed most of the times in systems which provides orthogonal Hamiltonians.

In the case of orthogonal Hamiltonians there is the Cartan decomposition of the SU(2N) group [\cite=Khaneja01], directly applied to the SU(4) group, which gives analytical solutions and was recently extended with an algorithm to realize every SU(2N) [\cite=Earp]. The decomposition provided by [\cite=Khaneja01] requires 5 different Hamiltonians and 27 computational steps to simulate an arbitrary gate while the number of computational steps reduces to 19 in the case of a controlled gate.

Next we show the results of numerical simulations of the present computational scheme:

Orthogonal Hamiltonians If the Hamiltonians are orthogonal (e.g. Heisenberg interaction [\cite=Braunstein00], BQHD [\cite=Scarola03], SQUIDs [\cite=Mahklin00]) then with two binary switches providing us with 3 different Hamiltonians and within 15 computational steps we cover the SU(4) group (conjecture) and all the tested gates are successfully simulated.

For example, in a system described by a general Hamiltonian of the form [formula] (Heisenberg interaction), only 3 Hamiltonians

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

are sufficient for universal quantum computation in 15 computational steps

[formula]

Non-Orthogonal Hamiltonians If the Hamiltonians are non-orthogonal (charge Josephson junctions [\cite=Mahklin00], quantum dots [\cite=Tanamoto00], permanent interaction which cannot be switched off etc) but the interaction between the qubits is weak, then using 4 different Hamiltonians and within 15 computational steps (time parameters) a large part of the SU(4) is covered and all the known important gates for quantum computation are successfully simulated. In general, the weaker the interaction, the larger the part of the group covered (more gates can be simulated).

a) Permanent Interaction. If the interaction J12 of the previous paradigm can not be switched of then a construction scheme with two binary switches and 3 non-orthogonal Hamiltonians

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

simulates all the basic gates in 15 steps ([\ref=eq:15steps]).

b) Charge Josephson junctions. A system of two identical coupled Josephson junctions is described by the following general Hamiltonian [formula]. Manipulation of 3 binary switches of the system provides the following 4 non-orthogonal Hamiltonians

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and all basic gates are simulated in 15 steps ([\ref=eq:15steps]).

The efficiency of our simulation is defined by a test function, ftest. It is a function of 15 time variables

[formula]

In our numerical simulations ftest usually attains values of 10- 8 or less. Taking into account more decimal digits in the approximation of the time parameters results to a further decrease of its value. Gates that have been tested numerically are all the important two-qubit gates for quantum computation such as the CNOT gate, the SWAP gate, the Quantum Fourier Transform gate for two qubits, several controlled gates etc. The ratio of the values of the external switches tuning amplitudes over the magnitude of the interaction is not in the area of hard pulses. Numerical results are available upon request from the authors.
