I. Introduction

The spectrum and structure of the scalar mesons are one of the most controversial subjects in hadron physics. In the recent issue of Review of Particle Physics[\cite=pdg], too many light scalar mesons in the region below 2 GeV are claimed to exist experimentally: two isovectors a0(980) and a0(1450), five isoscalars f0(600) / σ, f0(980), f0(1370), f0(1500) and f0(1710); and three isodoublets [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Among these states, it is not yet clear which are the members of the ground scalar meson nonet.

With respect to the nature of the a0(980), although some possible interpretations such as Kq molecule[\cite=KK], four-quark state[\cite=4quark] were proposed in the literature, many results given by different approaches support the argument that the a0(980) belongs to the ground scalar meson multiplet: (1) The K-matrix analysis of the Kπ S-wave[\cite=kpi] showed the mass of the 1 ~ 3P0 isovector state is about 960  ±  30 MeV and supported that the a0(980) is dominantly q system; (2) The naive quark model predicts that the LS force makes lighter the J = 0 states with respect to the J = 2, which favors that the a0(980) rather than the a0(1450) belongs to the the scalar member of the lowest 3PJ multiplet, because the a2(1320) is well established as a q pair. The same behavior is evident in the c and the b spectra[\cite=vij]; (3) Based on the theory of fine structure, it is suggested that it is the a0(980) but not the a0(1450) that could be a candidate for the ground 3P0 state [\cite=bad]; (4) Most of the fits of the data using the nonrelativistic quark model strongly favored that the a0(980) is the isovector member of the ground scalar nonet[\cite=nrqm]; (5) The calculation of the partial width for the decay a0(980)(f0(980))  →  γγ[\cite=tworr] based on the assumption that the a0(980) and f0(980) are the members of the 1 ~ 3P0 q multiplet is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data, which supports the idea of q origin of the scalar mesons a0(980) and f0(980); (6) The systematics of scalar q states on the linear trajectories in the (n,M2) and (J,M2) plane indicate the a0(980) lays comfortable on the linear trajectory, together with other scalar states[\cite=lintraj]; (7) The calculation within QCD sum rules method based on the argument that a0(980) is considered as a q bound state is consistent with the existing experimental data[\cite=sr]; (8) Some theoretical models such as U(3)×  U(3) σ model[\cite=nap], SU(3) σ model [\cite=su3], chiral quark model of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type[\cite=9904226] also suggested the mass of the isovector member of the ground scalar nonet is close to that of the a0(980).

Recently, the experimental discovery of the low-lying charm-strange meson [formula][\cite=dsj] maybe open a new window to reveal the nature of the scalar states. All experimental findings, such as all the observed decay modes and angular distributions are consistent with the interpretation as P-wave states with spin-parity assignment JP = 0+ for the [formula]. On the one hand, the picture of the [formula] composed of a heavy quark c and a light quark s fits well with the heavy-quark, chiral symmetries that predict parity doubling states (0-, 1-) and (0+, 1+), with the inerparity mass splittings in the chiral limit given by the Goldberger-Treiman relation, the subsequent observation of 1+ state [formula] strongly supports this picture[\cite=loop], and the assignment that the [formula] is the cs̄ member of the 1 ~ 3P0 q multiplet has been suggested by Particle Data Group[\cite=pdg]. On the other hand, the cs̄ picture of this state does not play well with the potential model calculations, which generally predict substantially larger mass. For example, the measured mass of the [formula] is 2317.4  ±  0.9 MeV, while the prediction of the 1 ~ 3P0 cs̄ state by Isgur and Godrey is 2.48 GeV[\cite=p1] and that by Di Pierro and Eichten is 2.487 GeV[\cite=p2], which are about 160 MeV higher than the measured mass of the [formula]. The substantially small observed mass led to many other interpretations on the nature of the [formula], such as the (DK) molecule, four-quark state, Dπ atom or baryonium. For the detailed review see e.g. Refs.[\cite=rev1] [\cite=rev2]. However, it should be noted that the one loop chiral corrections for heavy-light mesons in potential model[\cite=loop] and the coupled channel effect[\cite=couple] can naturally account for the unusually mass of the [formula], which confirms the q picture of the [formula]. More recently, radiative decays of the [formula] and [formula] have been studied by Colangelo et al. within light-cone QCD sum rules, the results show that invoking nonstandard interpretations of the [formula] and [formula] is not necessary, and strongly favor the idea of ordinary cs̄ origin of of the [formula] and [formula][\cite=0505195].

In the present work, we shall assume that the a0(980) and [formula] are the members of the 1 ~ 3P0 q multiplet, and discuss a possible assignment for the ground scalar q nonet in the framework of Regge phenomenology and meson-meson mixing.

II. The mass of the 1 ~ 3P0 ns̄ state in Regge phenomenology

A series of recent papers[\cite=lintraj] [\cite=lintraj1] [\cite=dmli] indicate that the quasi-linear Regge trajectory can, at least at present, give a reasonable description for the meson spectroscopy, and its predictions may be useful for the discovery of the meson states which have not yet been observed. By assuming the existence of the quasi-linear Regge trajectories for a meson multiplet, one can have

[formula]

where i ([formula]) refers to the quark (antiquark) flavor, J and Mi are respectively the spin and mass of the i meson, αi(0) and [formula] are respectively the intercept and slope of the trajectory on which the i meson lies. For a meson multiplet, the parameters for different flavors can be related by the following relations(see Ref.[\cite=dmli] and references therein)

(i) additivity of intercepts,

[formula]

(ii) additivity of inverse slopes,

[formula]

From relations ([\ref=trajectory])-([\ref=slope]), one can have

[formula]

where n denotes u- or d-quark.

In our estimate of the mass of the 1 ~ 3P0 ns̄ state, we adopt the assumption presented by Ref.[\cite=dmli] that the slopes of the parity partners' trajectories coincide. Under this assumption, the slopes of the scalar meson trajectories are the same as those of the vector meson trajectories. With the help of slopes of the vector meson trajectories extracted by Ref.[\cite=dmli], we have [formula] GeV- 2, [formula] GeV- 2, [formula] GeV- 2 and [formula] GeV- 2. Inserting Mnn̄ = Ma0(980) = 984.7  ±  1.2 MeV, Mc = Mχc0(1P) = 3415.19  ±  0.34 MeV and [formula] MeV[\cite=pdg] into relation ([\ref=nsmass]), one can have Mns̄ = 1051.99  ±  1.48 MeV.

III. The 1 ~ 3P0 meson nonet in meson-meson mixing

It is well known that in a meson nonet, the pure isoscalar nn̄ and ss̄ states can mix to produce the physical isoscalar states f0(M1) and f0(M2). In order to understand the physical scalar states, we shall discuss the mixing of the nn̄ and ss̄ states below.

In the [formula], S = ss̄ basis, the mass-squared matrix describing the mixing of the f0(M1) and f0(M2) can be written as[\cite=su3] [\cite=jpg]

[formula]

where MN and Mns̄ are the masses of the states N and ns̄, respectively; β denotes the total annihilation strength of the q pair for the light flavors u and d; X describes the SU(3)-breaking ratio of the nonstrange and strange quark propagators via the constituent quark mass ratio mu / ms. The masses of the two physical scalar states f0(M1) and f0(M2), M1 and M2, can be related to the matrix M2 by the unitary matrix U

[formula]

and the physical states f0(M1) and f0(M2) can be expressed as

[formula]

The constituent quark mass ratio can be determined within the nonrelativistic constituent quark model(NRCQM). In NRCQM[\cite=nrqm] [\cite=prd57], the mass of a q state with L = 0, Mq is given by

[formula]

where m and [formula] are the constituent quark mass and spin, Λ is a constant. Since [formula] for spin-0 mesons and 1 / 4 for spin-1 mesons, in the SU(2) flavor symmetry limit, one can have

[formula]

From relation ([\ref=dig]), one can have

[formula]

For the scalar meson nonet, the masses of two isoscalar physical states satisfy the following approximate sum rule

[formula]

which is derived by Dmitrasinovic in the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with a UA(1) symmetry-breaking instanton-induced 't Hooft interaction[\cite=sumrule].

With the help of MN = Ma0(980) and Mns̄ = 1051.99  ±  1.48 MeV estimated in section II, from relations ([\ref=mix])-([\ref=sumrule]), we can obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, under the assumption that the a0(980) and [formula] belong to the 1 ~ 3P0 meson multiplet, in the Regge phenomenology and meson-meson mixing, we suggest that the a0(980), [formula], f0(1099) and f0(530) constitute the ground scalar meson nonet.

IV. Discussions

Obviously, the mass of the f0(530) agrees with that of the observed scalar resonance f0(600) / σ with a mass range of 400-1200 MeV, also, the picture that the f0(530) is composed mostly of nonstrange quarkonia is consistent with the decay patterns of the f0(600) / σ[\cite=pdg]. This suggests that the f0(530) would correspond to the observed state f0(600) / σ.

The K-matrix analysis of the Kπ S-wave by Anisovich et al.[\cite=kpi] reveals the lowest scalar kaon with the pole position at 1090  ±  40 MeV, which favors our estimated mass of the [formula]. Comparison of the [formula] and the observed scalar kaon states, κ, [formula] and [formula], indicates that if the κ really exists, the [formula] would very likely correspond to the κ(900) with a mass of 905+ 65- 30 MeV[\cite=ishida].

With respect to the f0(1099), its estimated mass is close to the mass of the observed scalar state f0(980) (980  ±  10 MeV), also close to the mass of the observed scalar state f0(1370) (1200 - 1500 MeV), and relation ([\ref=content]) clearly shows that the f0(1099) is composed mostly of ss̄. The results of analysis[\cite=ani] for the two-meson spectra support the picture that the f0(980) is composed mostly of ss̄ quarks. The transition φ(1020)  →  γf0(980) can be well described within the approach of additive quark model, with the dominant q component in the f0(980)[\cite=0403123], and the decay f0(980)  →  γγ can be also treated in terms of the q structure of the f0(980)[\cite=tworr] [\cite=tworr1]. The values of partial widths in both decays ( φ(1020)  →  γf0(980) and f0(980)  →  γγ) support the existence of a significant ss̄-component in the f0(980). The study of the D+s  →  π+f0(980) decay by many authors[\cite=d1] [\cite=d2] [\cite=d3] [\cite=d4] also led to the conclusion about the ss̄ nature of the f0(980). The decay patterns of the f0(1370)[\cite=pdg] implies that the f0(1370) should be mainly non-strange. Therefore, the mass and the quarkonia content of the f0(1099) strongly suggest that the f0(1099) would correspond to the observed scalar state f0(980) rather than the f0(1370).

Based on the above analysis, the results of the present work predict the ground scalar meson nonet consisting of the a0(980), [formula], f0(1099) and f0(530). These states would correspond to the observed scalar states a0(980), κ(900), f0(980) and f0(600) / σ, respectively.

The masses of the ground scalar meson nonet has been estimated by Volkov[\cite=9904226] in the framework of a nonlocal version of a chiral quark model of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type where the correct masses for the ground pseudoscalar meson nonet and vector meson nonet can be produced. The calculation of Volkov[\cite=9904226] shows that the ground scalar meson nonet is composed of the a0(830), f0(530), f0(1070) and [formula], and thereby suggests that these states correspond to the observed scalar states a0(980), σ, f0(980) and [formula], respectively.

Oller[\cite=oller] has already suggested that the a0(980), κ, f0(980) and σ resonances constitute the lightest scalar nonet in three different and complementary ways: a) by establishing the continuous movement of the poles from the physical to a SU(3) limit, b) by performing an analysis of the couplings of the scalar mesons to pairs of pseudoscalars and c) by analysing the couplings of the scalars with meson-meson SU(3) scattering eigenstates. The results given by Oller[\cite=oller] show

[formula]

Clearly, the agreement between ([\ref=content]) and ([\ref=content1]) is good.

It is worth mention that our suggested q assignment for the ground scalar nonet is also favored by the results suggested by U(3)×  U(3) σ model[\cite=nap] and SU(3) σ model[\cite=su3].

Finally, we remark also that the masses of the f0(1099) and f0(530) predicted in the present work are below a typical range of 1730  ±  50  ±  80 MeV suggested by Lattice QCD calculation for the ground scalar glueball[\cite=lattice]. The masses of the two isoscalar scalar mesons may get shifted from the predicted values due to the possible mixture with the ground scalar glueball.

V. Concluding remarks

In the presence of the a0(980) and [formula] belonging to the 1 ~ 3P0 q multiplet, we estimate the mass of the 1 ~ 3P0 kaon meson in the framework of the quasi-linear Regge trajectory. Then in the framework of the meson-meson mixing, we suggest the a0(980), [formula], f0(1099) and f0(530) constitute the ground scalar meson nonet. We find that the f0(1099) is mostly strange while the f0(530) is mainly non-strange. We suppose that the [formula], f0(1099) and f0(530) would likely correspond to the observed scalar states κ(900), f0(980) and f0(600) / σ, respectively. Our suggested q assignment for the 1 ~ 3P0 meson nonet is consistent with the assignments established by [\cite=nap] [\cite=su3] [\cite=9904226] [\cite=oller] in different approaches. The fact that the agreement between the present findings and those given by other different approaches is satisfactory implies that the argument that the a0(980) and [formula] are ordinary 1 ~ 3P0 q states may be reasonable.
