Grassmannians and representations

Introduction

For any positive integer n the higher cohomology of the line bundle O(n) on [formula] vanishes. The dimension of the space of global sections of this bundle is easily calculated to be [formula] via the identification of [formula] with the vector space of homogeneous forms of degree n in m variables.

If we view [formula] as the space of lines in an m-dimensional vector space V, then the line bundle O(n) is the n-th tensor power of the dual of the tautological line subbundle O( - 1). Generalizing to the Grassmannian of k-planes we are led to a number of questions about the cohomology of vector bundles on Grassmannians.

The most obvious question is the following: Let V be a vector space of dimension m. Compute the dimension of the space of sections [formula] as a function of k,m,n, where V is the dual of the tautological rank k subbundle on the Grassmannian of k-planes in V. Likewise, if we are interested in the dimension of linear systems we could ask for the dimension of the linear system [formula].

In this note we use Bott-Borel-Weil theory to answer these questions. In particular we will compute for any (irreducible) representation W of [formula] the dimension [formula] where W is the vector bundle on [formula] whose fiber at a point corresponding to a k-dimensional linear subspace L is the dual vector space W* viewed as a [formula]-module. In addition we explain when the higher cohomology vanishes.

Our motivation came from trying to understand cohomology of vector bundles on classifying spaces. It is also closely related to the study of representations of ind-groups ([\cite=twoivansandthewolf]). The classifying space, [formula], for the multiplicative group [formula], is the infinite projective space [formula]. The sequence of bundles [formula] defines a line bundle on [formula] whose global sections is the limit of the countable sequence of finite dimensional vector spaces [formula].

In a similar way the classifying space [formula] may be identified with the infinite Grassmannian [formula] which is the limit of the finite-dimensional Grassmannians [formula]. For a given [formula]-module W, the associated sequence of vector bundles on [formula] defines a vector bundle on the classifying space [formula]. As we show below, the global sections of these bundles on Gr(k,m) have natural [formula]-module structures and the sequence of global sections {H0(Gr(k,m),W)}∞m = k defines a representation of the ind-group [formula]. When W is irreducible this is an irreducible representation of [formula] in the sense of [\cite=twoivansandthewolf].

Definitions and statement of results

We work over an arbitrary algebraically closed field K.

For any k and m  ≥  k we may construct the Grassmannian [formula] as follows: Let [formula] be the open set parametrizing m  ×  k matrices of rank k. There is a free action of [formula] on Uk,m given by right matrix multiplication and [formula]. The principal bundle [formula] is the frame bundle; i.e., the fiber over a point of [formula] corresponding to a linear subspace L is the set of all possible bases for L in the vector space Km. When k = 1, this gives the familiar construction of [formula] as the quotient of [formula] by [formula].

If W is a (left) [formula]-module then we obtain a vector bundle on [formula] by taking the quotient [formula] where [formula] acts diagonally on the product Uk,m  ×  W. When W is the defining representation of [formula], then W is the dual of the tautological rank k subbundle of [formula]. Likewise if W is the determinant character, then W is the line bundle which gives the Plücker embedding.

Since [formula] acts on Uk,m by left matrix multiplication the quotient bundle [formula] is [formula]-equivariant, so the cohomology of W is a (left) [formula]-module. The main result of this paper is the determination of these cohomology modules.

To state our theorem we recall some notation about [formula]-modules. Let [formula] be the group of diagonal matrices and let Bk the group of upper triangular matrices. Any nonincreasing sequence of integers [formula] determines a [formula]-module V(k)λ which is defined as follows: The sequence of integers λ determines a character of Tk which we also call λ. This character extends to a representation of Bk. Let Lλ be the line bundle [formula], where Bk acts diagonally, and set [formula]. When the characteristic of K is 0 then V(k)λ is irreducible. In any characteristic, the groups Hi(GLk / Bk,Lλ) vanish for i  >  0 [\cite=Demazure].

With this notation Vλ and Vλ' restrict to the same representation of [formula] if and only if λl  -  λ'l is constant (i.e. independent of l). In this case [formula] where r  =  λl  -  λ'l and D is the determinant character of [formula].

Let [formula] be a sequence of non-increasing integers and let V(k)λ be the associated representation of [formula]. Let Vλ be the corresponding vector bundle on [formula].

(a) If λk  ≥  0, then [formula], and [formula] for i > 0. Here V(m)λ denotes the [formula]-module with highest weight [formula].

(b) If λk  <  0, then for sufficiently large m, [formula] for all i.

Bott-Borel-Weil theory for parabolics

The material here is well known, but we do not know a reference with algebraic proofs.

Let H be an affine algebraic group and let π:X  →  Y be an H-principal bundle. If F is an H-equivariant OX-module, set FH to be subsheaf of invariant sections of π*F. Given an OY-module G, [formula] has a natural H-action given by the action of H on OX. Because H acts freely, the functors G  ↦  π*G and F  ↦  FH are inverse to each other.

Let [formula] and X  →  Y be principal H-bundles. Let q:X'  →  X be a H-equivariant. Then there is an induced map p:Y'  →  Y such that the diagram

[formula]

commutes.

Diagram [\eqref=diag.cartesian] is cartesian.

Since the diagram commutes there is an H-equivariant map X'  →  Y'  ×  YX. Now X'  →  Y' and Y'  ×  YX  →  Y' are both principal bundles over Y. After base change by a flat surjective morphism X'  →  Y' both bundles are trivialized. Thus the map of Y'-schemes, X'  →  Y'  ×  YX is an isomorphism after flat surjective base change. Therefore it is an isomorphism.

Let [formula] be a commutative (hence cartesian) diagram of principal H-bundles as above. Then for any H-equivariant OX'-module F there are natural isomorphism of OY-modules (Riq*F)H  =  Rip*(FH) for any i  ≥  0.

Because [formula], and cohomology commutes with base change [\cite=Hartshorne], there are natural isomorphisms Riq*F  =  π*Rip*FH. Pushing forward by π and taking H-invariants yields the desired isomorphism.

Let G be an algebraic group, B  ⊂  G a Borel subgroup and P  ⊃  B a parabolic subgroup. Let p:G / B  →  G / P be the projection.

If λ is a B-module, then G  ×  PHi(P / B,P  ×  Bλ)  =  Rip*(G  ×  Bλ) as G-equivariant bundles on G / P.

The map G  ×  P / B  →  G / B given by (g,pB)  ↦  gpB is a P-principal bundle, where P acts freely on G  ×  P / B by the formula q  ·  (g,pB)  =  (gq,q- 1pB) where q∈P.

Thus we have a commutative diagram with the vertical arrows proper and the horizontal arrows quotient maps by the free action of B.

[formula]

Consider the P-equivariant line bundle L = G  ×  (P  ×  Bλ) on G  ×  P / B. Since q is a projection, Riq*L  =  G  ×  Hi(P / B,P  ×  Bλ). On the other hand LP  =  G  ×  Bλ so so by Lemma [\ref=lem.invcommute], G  ×  PHi(P / B,P  ×  Bλ) is naturally isomorphic to Rip*(G  ×  Bλ). Since this isomorphism is natural, it is equivariant for the G-actions on these bundles.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm.main]

Let [formula], and let Bm be the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices. Let P be the parabolic subgroup of matrices of the form [formula] with [formula], [formula] and U an arbitrary k  ×  (m - k) matrix. The subgroup N of matrices of the form [formula] is normal and [formula].

Uk,m is isomorphic to the homogeneous space G / N.

Any m  ×  k matrix of maximal rank can be viewed as the first k columns of a nonsingular m  ×  m matrix. Since [formula] acts transitively on itself by left multiplication, it also acts transitively on the space Uk,m of m  ×  k matrices of maximal rank. The stabilizer of the m  ×  k matrix [formula] is the subgroup [formula].

Using Lemma [\ref=lem.framebundle] we obtain the well known identification of [formula] [formula]. Likewise for any [formula]-module, the vector bundle [formula] is identified with G  ×  PV where V is made into a P-module via the surjective map [formula].

Since P is a parabolic subgroup containing B we have a proper map [formula]. Let Lλ be the line bundle on G / B corresponding to the weight [formula]. Then by Bott-Borel-Weil H0(G / B,Lλ)  =  V(m)λ.

p*(Lλ) = Vλ as [formula] equivariant bundles on [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=prop.parabolic], p*(Lλ)  =  G  ×  PH0(P / B,P  ×  BLλ). Thus to prove the Lemma we must compute H0(P / B,P  ×  BLλ).

Since P is a unipotent extension of GLk  ×  GLm - k, the homogeneous space P / B is isomorphic to the product GLk / Bk  ×  GLm - k / Bm - k, where [formula] and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

Since [formula], its restriction Bk is the highest weight vector [formula], and its restriction to Bm - k is trivial.

Part (a) of the theorem now follows easily from Lemma [\ref=lem.pushforward]. First observe that [formula]. If all of the λk's are nonnegative then H0(G / B,Lλ)  =  V(m)λ and Hi(G / B,Lλ)  =  0 for i  >  0. It follows from the Leray spectral sequence that that Hi(G / P,p*Lλ)  =  0 as well.

We now prove (b). Suppose that λk  <  0. It suffices to show that, for m sufficiently large, that Hi(G / B,G  ×  Bλ)  =  0 where is the character of the maximal torus with weight [formula].

Let [formula] be the flag fixed by the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices [formula]. For any l  <  m let Pl be the parabolic subgroup fixing the subflag [formula]. Then Pl  ⊂  Pl - 1 and the fibers of the map pl:G / Pl  →  G / Pl - 1 are isomorphic to the projective space [formula]. In this way the flag variety G / B  =  G / Pm - 1 is realized as being at the top of the tower of projective bundles

[formula]

The group Pl is isomorphic to the product [formula] where Bl is the Borel group of upper triangular matrices in [formula]. Thus, irreducible representations of Pl are of the form χ  ×  W where χ is a character of the maximal torus in Bl and W is an irreducible representation of GLm - l. If [formula] is a character of the maximal torus of Bl then the same argument used in the proof Proposition [\ref=prop.parabolic] shows that Ripl *(G  ×  Plχ)  =  G  ×  Pl - 1Hi(Pl - 1 / Pl,Pl - 1  ×  Plχ). Under the identification [formula] the line bundle Pl - 1  ×  Plχ corresponds to [formula].

If λ is a character of Tm with [formula] then we may view λ as Pl-module for l  ≥  k. The argument of the previous paragraph implies that Hi(G / B,G  ×  Bλ)  =  Hi(G / Pk,G  ×  Pkλ). If λk  <  0 then, for all j, [formula] whenever m  ≥    -  λk + k. Thus Rjpk *(G /   ×  Pkλ)  =  0 for all j as long as m is sufficiently large. Therefore, by the Leray spectral sequence, it follows that Hi(G / B,Lλ)  =  0 for all i.

Some explicit dimension computations

We conclude by using Theorem [\ref=thm.main] to compute the dimensions of [formula] for some particular Vλ involving symmetric powers and the determinant. To do this, we combine Theorem [\ref=thm.main] with [\cite=Fulton-Harris] to obtain a convenient formula for the dimensions.

Let [formula] be a sequence of nonincreasing integers, and let V(k)λ be the associated representation of [formula] with Vλ the corresponding vector bundle on [formula].

If all λi  ≥  0, then

[formula]

where j runs from 2 to m, and [formula].

The first proposition gives a symmetry result about the dimension of a power of the determinant. Throughout the rest of this section, let V denote the standard k-dimensional representation of [formula] and V the corresponding tautological rank k vector bundle on [formula].

For all 0  <  k  ≤  m and l  >  0,

[formula]

[formula]

The partition λ associated to [formula] is [formula]. Hence by Lemma [\ref=lem.dimensions],

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

To show that the two dimensions are equal, we induct on l. When l = 1, it is easy to compute that both dimensions are [formula]. Suppose now that s  >  1, and we have proven that the dimensions are the same for l = s - 1. The induction hypothesis gives us that

[formula]

Hence, letting l = s,

[formula]

[formula]

The rightmost product is what we want, so it suffices to show that the product of the first two factors is one. Note that

[formula]

which completes the proof.

Assume that the characteristic of the ground field is 0. If we fix k and l and let m go to infinity, then sequence of irreducible [formula] representations [formula] determines an irreducible representation of the ind-group [formula]. Proposition [\ref=prop.symmetry] implies that the dimensions of the finite dimensional representations [formula] are the same as the dimensions of the irreducible [formula]-modules [formula].

As noted in [\cite=twoivansandthewolf] the infinite Grassmannian [formula] is an ind-projective variety. For fixed l, the sequence of [formula]-modules [formula] is the ind-representation of [formula] corresponding to the degree l component of the ideal of Plücker relations for the embedding of [formula] into the infinite projective space given by the sequence of projective spaces [formula]. (Here Vm denotes the standard representation of [formula].)

Proposition [\ref=prop.symmetry] allows us to compute the sequence of dimensions of the Plücker relations in degree l. In particular the dimension of the [formula]-module of Plücker relations in degree l is

[formula]

For all r  ≥  0 and 0  <  k  ≤  m,

[formula]

Use Lemma [\ref=lem.dimensions] and the partition [formula].

For all r  ≥  0, l  ≥  0, and 0  <  k  ≤  m,

[formula]

[formula]

As we would expect, when l = 0, we get [formula], and when r = 0, we have (after a bit of manipulation) the dimension of [formula]. Also, the product over j is exactly [formula] (again easy to see after a little algebra).

We use the partition [formula], where λj  =  0 for all k + 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. By Lemma [\ref=lem.dimensions], the dimension is

[formula]

The first product is [formula]. Consider the second product. We have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The last factor is

[formula]

Multiplying the top and bottom by l! yields

[formula]

Finally, multiplying all three products together completes the proof.

Using Theorem [\ref=thm.main] it is easy to show that if d  ≤  k then [formula] where Vm is the standard representation of [formula]. In particular [formula]. An interesting question is to determine whether there are relatively simple formulas for the dimension of [formula]. If l  ≥  0 then Theorem [\ref=thm.main] gives the summation formula

[formula]

where the sum is over all k-element partitions λ of d, mλ is the product of the hook lengths in the tableau corresponding to the partition [formula], and V(m)λ + l refers to the [formula]-module with highest weight [formula]. Unfortunately, we have do not know how to simplify this sum. Other summation formulas can also be obtained using the Riemann-Roch or localization theorems. When - d  <  l  <  0, there is the added difficulty that some, but not all, of the sequences [formula] have negative entries, so the corresponding line bundles on [formula] have no cohomology for sufficiently large m.
