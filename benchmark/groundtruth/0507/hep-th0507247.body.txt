Recently H.Katsura and H.Aoki [\cite=KA] considered an exact supersymmetry in the relativistic hydrogen atom in general dimensions. It was established, that supercharges are connected to the pseudoscalar invariant, which commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian in Coulomb field. In usual 3-dimensions this invariant coincides to the Johnson-Lippmann (J.-L.) operator, which was introduced by these authors in 1950 in a very brief abstract [\cite=JL]. As to more detailed settle, by our knowledge, it had not been published neither then nor after. First respond on relativistic Kepler problem in this point of view appeared in 60-ies [\cite=Bi]. Main attention was paid to the ways of deriving simpler solutions of the Dirac equation as far as possible.

After 80-ies the interest was grown from the positions of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Supersymmetry of the Dirac equation in Coulomb problem was demonstrated, but for this purpose mainly the radial equations was considered for deriving the best separation of variables.

In the above mentioned paper [\cite=KA] the supercharges in relativistic case is obtained for the first time. As it turns out, the decisive part plays the J.-L. operator, the generalization of which in arbitrary dimensions was introduced by these authors and, therefore they named it as Johnson-Lippman -Katsura-Aoki operator.

In any article [\cite=KA] or text books (See, [\cite=Ber] , for example), there is underlined only that its commutativity with Hamiltonian can be proved by longtime and tedious calculations.

Derivation of Witten superalgebra is based on very simple logic: It is known that the so called Dirac operator, which has the form [\cite=Ber]

[formula]

commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian

[formula]

(In fact, K commutes with Hamiltonian for arbitrary central potential). In equation ([\ref=Dirope]) [formula] is the angular momentum vector and [formula] is the electron spin matrix

[formula]

The Sommerfeld formula for the Hydrogen atom spectrum reads [\cite=Dir]

[formula]

Here k is the eigenvalue of K, [formula]. It seems, that the energy spectrum is degenerate with respect of signs of k, ±  (k).

An operator, that anticommute with K, is able to interchange these signs, moreover if this operator would commute with Hamiltonian at the same time, the supersymmetry algebra appears. It was shown in [\cite=KA], that the J.-L. operator has precisely these properties. The J.-L. operator looks like [\cite=JL]

[formula]

We are inclined to think that in following importance of this operator will enhance in studies of dynamical symmetries because of its connection to the Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector and "accidental" degeneracy.

Therefore it seems highly desirable , by our opinion, to derive the J.-L. operator from the first and simplest principles. Below we propose one of our path of construction this operator, which is rather simple and very transparent.

First of all we need to extend one important theorem known for Pauli electron [\cite=AJ] [\cite=BL] to the Dirac equation.

Theorem: Suppose [formula] is a vector with respect to the orbital angular momentum [formula], i.e.

[formula]

At the same time [formula] is to be perpendicular to [formula], i.e., [formula].

Then the Dirac's K operator anticommutes with [formula]- scalar operator [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

The proof of this theorem is very easy. For that it is sufficient to consider the product [formula] in direct and reversed orders, making use of commutating properties of Dirac matrices. It follows that

[formula]

Remembering [formula], this result can be carry over the Dirac's K operator

[formula]

It is evident, that the class of anticommuting with K(or K- odd) operators is not confined by these operators only - any operator of type [formula], where Ô is commuting with K, but otherwise arbitrary, also is K-odd.

Let mention, that in the framework of constraints of above theorem, the following very useful relation takes place

[formula]

We see, that the antisymmetrized vector product, familiar for LRL vector, appears on the right- hand-side of this relation.

Important special cases, resulting from the above theorem, include [formula] (unit radial vector), [formula] (linear momentum) and [formula] (LRL vector), which has the following form [\cite=TT]

[formula]

According to ([\ref=usrel]), there appears one relation between these three odd operators

[formula]

So far as = 0, it follows that [formula] and [formula] can be used as a permissible K-odd operator.

Our purpose is to construct such combination of K-odd operators, which would be commuting with Dirac Hamiltonian. We can solve this task by step by step. As a first trial expression let consider the following operator

[formula]

Here the coefficients are chosen in such a way, that A1 be Hermitian, when x1 ~ , ~ x2 are arbitrary real numbers. These numbers must be determined from the requirement of commuting with H. Let calculate

[formula]

Appearing here commutators can be calculated easily. The result is

[formula]

One can see, that the first term in right-hand side is antidiagonal, while the second term is diagonal. So this expression never becomes vanishing for ordinary real numbers x1 ~ , ~ x2. Therefore we must perform the second step: one has to include new odd structure, which appeared on the right-hand side of above expression. Hence, we are faced to the new trial operator

[formula]

Here f(r) is an arbitrary scalar function to be determined. Let calculate new commutator. We have

[formula]

Grouping diagonal and antidiagonal matrices separately and equating this expression to zero, we obtain equation

[formula]

This equation is to be satisfied, if diagonal and antidiagonal terms become zero separately, i.e.,

[formula]

First of all, let us integrate the second equation in the interval (r ~ , ~   ∞  ). It follows

[formula]

Accounting this in the first equation, we have

[formula]

Then we obtain also

[formula]

Therefore finally we have derived the following operator which commutes with Dirac Hamiltonian

[formula]

It is K-odd, in accord with above theorem.

If we turn to usual [formula] matrices using the relation [formula] and taking into account the expression ([\ref=Dirham]) of the Dirac Hamiltonian, A2 can be reduced to the more familiar form (x1, as unessential common factor, may be dropped)

[formula]

This expression is nothing but the Johnson-Lippmann operator, ([\ref=JLoper]).

In order to clear up its physical meaning, remark, that equation ([\ref=opcomDH]) may be rewrite in the form

[formula]

It is evident, that in nonrelativistic limit, when β  →  1 and γ5  →  0, this operator coincides to the projection of LRL vector on the electron spin direction, [formula] or because of [formula] it is a projection on the total [formula] momentum direction.

After this it is clear that the Witten algebra can be derived by identifying supercharges as

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

This last factor may be identified as a Witten Hamiltonian (N=2 supersymmetry).

As for spectrum, it is easy to show that the following relation holds [\cite=KA]

[formula]

Because all operators entered here commute with H, we can replace them by their eigenvalues. Therefore, we obtain energy spectrum pure algebraically. In this respect it is worth-while to note full analogy with classical mechanics, where closed orbits were derived by calculating the square of the LRL vector without solving the differential equation of motion, [\cite=Gol]. In conclusion we are convinced that the degeneracy of spectrum relative to interchange k  →   - k is associated to the existence of conserved J.-L. operator which takes its origin from the LRL vector. It is also remarkable, that the same symmetry is responsible for absence of the Lamb shift in this problem. Inclusion the Lamb-shift terms into the Dirac Hamiltonian breaks commutativity of A with H.

In conclusion we should like to express our cincere appreciation to professors Misha Zviadadze, Gela Devidze and Badri Magradze for their critical remarks.
