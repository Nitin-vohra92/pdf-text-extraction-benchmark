Introduction

There are two main approaches to complex spinors on Riemannian manifolds that are not necessarily orientable. The first assumes the existence of a pinc structure, defined as a reduction of the bundle of all orthonormal frames of a Riemannian manifold M of dimension m to the group [formula]. The consideration of a pinc, rather than pin, structure is motivated, in part, by the need of physics to describe charged fermions. The insistence on pin, rather than spin, structures is also influenced by physics where it is necessary to consider transformations of spinor fields under reflections. Spinc structures appear in the theory of the Seiberg-Witten invariants. The second approach is based on the notion of complex spinor bundles. If m is even, then these two aproaches are equivalent: the spinor bundle is associated with a pinc structure. If m is odd and M is not orientable, then a spinor bundle is associated with a weaker Lipschitz structure, a notion introduced by Friedrich and Trautman [\cite=FT2000]; it is recalled here in Section [\ref=s:prel].

In every mathematical category it is of interest to know for which pairs of objects a product is defined. For example, there is a natural, direct product of every pair of Riemannian manifolds. If both factors have a spin structure ('are spin'), then their product is also spin. The product of two Riemannian manifolds has a pin structure if, and only if, both factors are pin and at least one of them is orientable [\cite=CGT].

In this paper we consider the question of existence of a pinc structure on the product of two closed (i.e. compact without boundary) Riemannian manifolds. The main result consists in the proof, in Section [\ref=s:proof], of the following

Let M1 and M2 be closed Riemannian manifolds. The Riemannian manifold M1  ×  M2 has a pinc structure if, and only if, both M1 and M2 have a pinc structure and there holds one of the following conditions:

(i) one of the manifolds is orientable,

(ii) the first Stiefel-Whitney classes of both manifolds have integral lifts, i.e. there exist elements [formula], i = 1,2, such that

[formula]

To make the paper self-contained, we recall in Section [\ref=s:prel] some results on Lipschitz structures proved in [\cite=FT2000]. In Section [\ref=s:ex], Theorem 1 is used to construct examples of manifolds with a Lipschitz structure that do not admit a pinc structure. Among them is a manifold of dimension 5, this being the lowest dimension for which this phenomenon can occur.

Preliminaries

Notation and terminology

We use the standard notation and terminology, mainly the one of [\cite=ThF2000], [\cite=FT2000] and [\cite=Lawson89]. For the convenience of the reader, some of the relevant definitions are presented below. The ring of integers modulo m, where [formula], is denoted by [formula]; in particular, [formula] is the two-element field. A real, finite-dimensional vector space V with a positive-definite quadratic form is referred to as a Euclidean space; the orthogonal group of its automorphisms is [formula]. The dual of a finite-dimensional vector space S over [formula] is [formula] and [formula] is the evaluation map. The vector space of all semi-linear maps from S* to [formula] is denoted by S̄; there is a semi-linear map S  →  S̄, φ  ↦  , defined by [formula] for every ω∈S*. The vector spaces [formula] and [formula] can be identified and are denoted by S̄*. All manifolds and maps among them are assumed to be smooth; TM denotes the total space of the tangent bundle of the manifold M. The trivial bundle [formula] is denoted by θk.

Results from topology

Our main references for algebraic topology are [\cite=Greenberg81] and [\cite=MiSt74]. The standard notation for the homology and cohomology groups is used; the ith Stiefel-Whitney class of a vector bundle E  →  M is denoted by wi(E).

Obstructions to existence of spinor structures

Recall that w1(TM) = 0 is equivalent to the orientability of M. Depending on whether the group Pin is defined in terms of a Clifford algebra based on a quadratic form that is positive- or negative-definite, one has the notion of a pin+ or pin- structure. A Riemannian manifold M has a pin+ (resp., pin-) structure if, and only if, w2(TM) = 0 (resp., w2(TM) + w1(TM)2 = 0); it has a pinc structure if, and only if, w2(TM) is the mod 2 reduction of an integral cohomology class [\cite=ThF2000] [\cite=Lawson89].

The Universal Coefficient Theorems

These theorems relate homology and cohomology groups with different coefficients. Let R be a ring; there are natural short exact sequences:

[formula]

and

[formula]

When R is a field, then

[formula]

Pinc and Lipschitz groups

Clifford algebras and spinor representations

Let V be a Euclidean, m-dimensional space, and let [formula] be its Clifford algebra. We put [formula] A volume element [formula] associated with V is defined as the product of a sequence of m pairwise orthogonal vectors and normalized so that η2 = 1; if η is a volume element, then so is -  η. There is a canonical antiautomorphism a  ↦  a† of [formula] defined as an [formula]-linear isomorphism of the vector structure such that a†  =  ā for [formula], v† = v for [formula] and (ab)† = b†a† for every a and [formula]. The antiautomorphism defines a unitary group

[formula]

Assume from now on that V is of odd dimension 2n - 1, [formula], define W to be the orthogonal sum [formula] and denote by u∈W a unit vector orthogonal to V. Since the dimension 2n of W is even, the algebra [formula] is simple and there is a complex, 2n-dimensional vector space S and an isomorphism

[formula]

of complex algebras with units, i.e., a faithful and irreducible 'Dirac representation' of the Clifford algebra in S. The map [formula] is also a faithful irreducible representation of [formula]; the simplicity of the algebra implies that they are equivalent: there is an isomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. By rescaling, [formula] can be made to satisfy [formula]; the Hermitean form

[formula]

is positive and invariant with respect to the action of the group [formula] in S, [formula] for every [formula] and φ∈S. The scalar product ([\ref=e:scp]) is used to define the adjoint f† of [formula] so that γ(a†) = γ(a)† for every [formula].

The restriction of ([\ref=e:Drepr]) to [formula] is a faithful, but reducible, representation of [formula] in S: if η is the volume element associated with V, then the subspaces

[formula]

are invariant for this restriction and [formula]. The 'Pauli representations' σ+ and σ- of [formula] in S+ and S-, respectively, are irreducible and inequivalent, but not faithful. For the purposes of this paper, it is convenient to refer to γ and [formula] as the spinor representations of the algebras in question.

The notation is chosen so that, taking into account that γ is an isomorphism, one can identify [formula] with [formula] and this is done in the sequel.

Pinc groups

The group [formula] is generated by the set of all unit elements of W and [formula] is generated by [formula] and [formula]. The adjoint representation of [formula] in W is given by [formula]. Similar definitions apply to the groups [formula] and [formula].

The dimension of W being even, there is the exact sequence

[formula]

The volume elements of the odd-dimensional space V are in the kernel of [formula] and the image of [formula] by [formula] is the special orthogonal group [formula]. To describe spinors on a nonorientable manifold, one needs a sequence like ([\ref=e:pin2n]), with the full orthogonal group as the image of [formula]. In odd dimensions, this can be achieved by either using, instead of [formula], the twisted adjoint representation [\cite=ABS] or extending the group [formula] to a larger Lipschitz group. Only the latter approach is suitable when one considers spinor bundles as the primitive notion.

The Lipschitz group

In the notation of Section [\ref=ss:srep], the Lipschitz group, associated with the odd-dimensional Euclidean space V  ⊂  W, is

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] is a subgroup of [formula] and the homomorphism [formula] is surjective because [formula] and [formula]. The kernel of [formula] is the subgroup

[formula]

so that there is an exact sequence

[formula]

Spinor bundles and Lipschitz structures

Spinor structures

Let M be a Riemannian manifold of dimension m; let V be a Euclidean space of dimension m and denote by P the [formula]-bundle of orthonormal frames on M. Let us agree to say that G is a spinor group if it contains [formula] as a subgroup and there is homomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. A spinor structure of type (G,ρ) on M is a reduction Q of P to a spinor group G characterized by the maps

[formula]

such that χ(qa) = χ(q)ρ(a) for q∈Q and a∈G.

Spinor bundles

One defines the complex Clifford bundle associated with a Riemannian manifold M as

[formula]

A complex vector bundle [formula], with a homomorphism

[formula]

of bundles of algebras over M, is said to be a bundle of Clifford modules. In particular, a spinor bundle is a bundle of Clifford modules such that the restriction of τ to every fibre is a spinor representation in the sense of Section [\ref=ss:srep].

A spinor bundle [formula] on an odd-dimensional manifold is said to be decomposable if there is a non-trivial vector bundle decomposition [formula] such that [formula]. In [\cite=FT2000] it is shown that there holds:

A spinor bundle on an odd-dimensional Riemannian manifold M is decomposable if, and only if, M is orientable.

Note that, for every x∈M, there is a decomposition [formula], as in ([\ref=e:dec]), and [formula], but a global decomposition holds only in the orientable case.

Since, by assumption, M is paracompact (even compact), there is a Hermitean scalar product on the fibres of [formula],

[formula]

Lipschitz structures

Let M and V be a Riemannian manifold and a Euclidean space, both of odd dimension m, respectively. A Lipschitz structure on M is defined as a spinor structure ([\ref=e:CD]) of type [formula]. A spinor bundle [formula] with a Hermitean scalar product defines, and is associated with, a Lipschitz structure such that the fibre Qx, x∈M, consists of all isomorphisms [formula] satisfying qVq- 1  =  τ(TxM) and [formula] for every φ∈S. The action of [formula] on Q is by composition of maps.

An odd-dimensional manifold M admits a Lipschitz structure if, and only if, there is a vector bundle [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

A proof of this proposition is in [\cite=FT2000].

Proof of the Theorem

Throughout the rest of the paper, M1 and M2 are closed Riemannian manifolds. By virtue of the Künneth theorem [\cite=Greenberg81], every element [formula] admits a decomposition

[formula]

An element [formula], decomposed as in ([\ref=e:decomp]), is the mod   2 reduction of [formula] if, and only if, there are elements [formula] such that [formula].

From the second sequence in Section [\ref=ss:UCT] and the fact that [formula] is free there follows

[formula]

Therefore, the groups [formula] are free for i = 0 and 1; the Künneth theorem applied to c gives

[formula]

To complete the proof, one reduces both sides of the last equality modulo 2 and notes that such a reduction respects the decomposition and acts on each summand separately.

The Whitney formula gives

[formula]

Applying Lemma 1 to the last equation one obtains that a necessary condition for the existence of a pinc structure on M1  ×  M2 is that both M1 and M2 have pinc structures. The condition becomes sufficient if, in addition, there holds:

[formula]

To complete the proof of the Theorem, one has to show that the alternative '(i) or (ii)' is equivalent to ([\ref=e:cond]). Part (i) is easy: one of the manifolds under consideration is orientable, if and only if, one can take c11 = 0 in ([\ref=e:cond]). Assume now that (i) does not hold so that α11  ≠  0. Since our manifolds are closed, their homology and cohomology groups are finitely generated,

[formula]

where Ti is the torsion of [formula] other than the 2-torsion part so that [formula]. Using ([\ref=e:H1Hom]) one can write

[formula]

where a'i and b'i is the reduction mod 2 of ai and bi, respectively. The classes w1(TM1) and w1(TM2) can be decomposed with respect to the above bases and one sees that condition ([\ref=e:cond]) is satisfied if, and only if, w1(TM1) and w1(TM2) do not contain summands with c'i and d'i, respectively.

Examples

Products of pinc manifolds

Recall that the real projective space [formula], [formula], has a pin structure [\cite=DT86]; therefore, a fortiori, it has a pinc structure. If [formula] and [formula], where k and l are positive integers, then M1  ×  M2 has no pinc structure.

Indeed, [formula] cannot be the reduction of an integral cohomology element because [formula] for [formula].

For every integer [formula] we now construct a non-orientable manifold Mk of dimension k so that Mk  ×  Mk has a pinc structure. Let B be the two-dimensional Möbius band and let Dk be the unit ball of dimension k so that its boundary is [formula]. The manifold Mk is defined as the sum of two manifolds, glued along their common boundary,

[formula]

The non-orientability of B implies that of Mk. One easily finds

[formula]

These groups are free and so are the groups [formula] for i = 0,1,2. This implies that all elements of [formula] have an integral lift; therefore, the manifold Mk  ×  Mk has a pinc structure, but, being a product of two non-orientable manifolds, it has no pin structure.

Lipschitz manifolds without pinc structure

In this section, we construct a series of examples of manifolds with a Lipschitz structure and without pinc structure. Following a remark in [\cite=KT90], we show that every three-dimensional manifold is pin-. We construct examples of five-dimensional manifolds with a Lipschitz structure and without pinc structure.

From Example [\ref=ex:1], it follows that [formula] has no pinc structure. Therefore, the same is true of the five-dimensional manifold [formula]. We now construct a vector bundle E  →  N, with fibres of real dimension 2, such that [formula] is a trivial. The embedding [formula] induces on [formula] a trivial bundle so that there is a line bundle l such that [formula] is trivial. One puts [formula]. From the Whitney product theorem one obtains w1(E) = w1(TN) and

[formula]

Since, for every manifold M, w1(TM)2 is the reduction mod 2 of an integral element (see, e.g., Section 6 in [\cite=FT2000]), the criterion ([\ref=e:FT]) for the existence of a Lipschitz structure on N is satisfied.

If M is a three-dimensional manifold, then Wu's formula (see § 11 in [\cite=MiSt74]) gives

[formula]

Here [formula] is the ith Wu class of M characterized by

[formula]

so that vi = 0 for i > 3 - i implying ([\ref=wuv2]). Equations ([\ref=wuw1])- ([\ref=wuv2]) give now w2(TM) = w1(TM)2; this shows that every three-dimensional manifold has pin- structure; therefore, a fortiori, a pinc structure (Section [\ref=ss:exist]). As a consequence, five is the smallest dimension of a manifold admitting a Lipschitz structure, but no pinc structure.

Example [\ref=ex:lnonpinc] can be generalized; it suffices to note that the example is based on two facts: [formula] is parallelizable and [formula] is stably trivial (even trivial). The projective space [formula] is also parallelizable and there are many manifolds with a stable trivial tangent bundle (Lie groups, spheres, orientable three-dimensional manifolds and products of these manifolds). This leads to the following example:

If M is (2n + 1)-dimensional and such that

[formula]

then the manifold

[formula]

has a Lipschitz structure, but no pinc structure. Indeed, denoting by li the normal line bundle for the embedding [formula], one can take

[formula]

One easily checks that

[formula]

and so the manifold ([\ref=e:manif]) has the desired property.
