A remark on higher congruences for the number of rational points of varieties defined over a finite field

Version franaise abrégée. Dans [\cite=EsUneq], Theorem 1.1, nous montrons que si X est un modèle régulier d'une variété X propre et lisse définie sur un corps local de corps résiduel [formula], alors si la cohomologie [formula]-adique Hi(X̄) est supportée en codimension ≥  1 pour i  ≥  1, le nombre de points rationnels de sa réduction Y modulo p vérifie [formula] modulo q. En fait, pour être plus précis, sous cette hypothèse, les valeurs propres du Frobenius géométrique agissant sur la cohomologie [formula]-adique Hi() de Y sont divisibles par q en tant qu'entiers algébriques. Le but de cette note est de discuter une formulation en coniveau supérieur. Une faon naturelle de généraliser la condition de coniveau ≥  1 pour i  ≥  1 est de supposer que Hi(X̄) / Hi(X̄)alg est supportée en codimension κ, où Hi(X̄)alg est nulle si i est impair et sinon est la partie algébrique. Nous montrons cependant que cela n'implique pas que les valeurs propres du Frobenius géométrique sont divisibles par qκ en tant qu'entiers algébriques sur [formula], où [formula] est nulle si i est impair et sinon est la partie sur laquelle le Frobenius agit par multiplication par [formula]. En particulier la formule naturelle [formula] modulo qκ n'est pas valable en général. Cette formulation est proposée par N. Fakhruddin dans [\cite=Fakh] qui la montre sous certaines hypothèses pour une famille géométrique en égale caractéristique p > 0. Nous montrons en quoi ces hypothèses sont très fortes.

Introduction

In [\cite=EsUneq], Theorem 1.1, we show that if X is a regular model of a smooth proper variety X defined over a local field with finite residue field [formula], then if [formula]-adic cohomology Hi(X̄) is supported in codimension ≥  1 for i  ≥  1, the number of rational points of its mod p reduction Y fulfills [formula] modulo q. To be more precise, the assumption implies that the eigenvalues of the geometric Frobenius acting on [formula]-adic cohomology Hi() of Y are q-divisible algebraic integers. The proof relies on a version of Deligne's integrality theorem [\cite=DeInt], Corollaire 5.5.3 over local fields [\cite=DE], Corollary 0.4. The goal of this note is to discuss a formulation in higher coniveau level. A natural generalization of the coniveau ≥  1 condition for i  ≥  1 is to assume that Hi(X̄) / Hi(X̄)alg is supported in codimension ≥  κ, where Hi(X̄)alg is equal to 0 if i is odd, else is the algebraic part of cohomology. This means that there is a codim ≥  κ subscheme Z  ⊂  X so that [formula]. Said differently, Hi(X̄) = Hi(X̄)alg for i  ≤  2κ, and [formula] for i  ≥  2κ.

However we show that this assumption does not imply that the eigenvalues of the geometric Frobenius acting on [formula] are divisible by qκ-divisible algebraic integers, where [formula] is equal to 0 if i is odd, else is the part of cohomology on which Frobenius acts by multiplication by [formula]. In particular, the formula [formula] modulo qκ does not hold in general. This formulation was proposed in [\cite=Fakh] by N. Fakhruddin, who shows it under certain assumptions in a geometric family in equal characteristic p > 0. We show how strong are those assumptions.

Our example consists of a Godeaux surface in characteristic 0. We take a reduction mod p which is a cone over a smooth curve C of higher degree. After desingularization of the mod p reduction, H1()( - 1) enters H3(), and this destroys the possibility of the [formula] mod q2 congruence.

The example

Let us consider the Godeaux surface [formula] defined as the quotient of the Fermat quintic [formula] of homogeneous equation px50 + x51 + x52 + x53 by the group μ5 acting via ξ  ·  (xi) = (ξi  ·  xi). Here p is prime to 5, and ξ generates the group of 5-th roots of unity. As well known [\cite=BPVdV], V, 15 and VII, 11, H0(X0,Ω1X0) = H0(X0,Ω2X0) and by comparison of de Rham with étale cohomology, one obtains H1(X̄0) = H3(X̄0) = 0, H2i(X̄0) = H2ialg(X̄0) for i = 0,1,2. Let us assume we have a regular model X  →  Spec(R) of X0 over an extension [formula], with local field K = Frac(R) and residue field [formula]. Thus the general fiber is [formula], and we denote by Y the mod p reduction over [formula].

We use the computation in [\cite=EsUneq], sections 2 and 3. One has an exact sequence where u means the pull back via the extension K  ⊂  Ku to the maximal unramified extension, and [formula] means the pull back via the extension to the algebraic closure. The sequence is equivariant with respect to the action of the geometric Frobenius [formula] acting on [formula]. One also has the exact sequence where I  ⊂  Gal(q / K) is the inertia group, with quotient [formula]. The sequence is equivariant with respect to the action of Frob. So using Gabber's purity theorem [\cite=Fu], Theorem 2.1.1. as in [\cite=EsUneq], section 2, one obtains and an equivariant exact sequence where [formula] singular locus. Thus in particular, Frob acts via multiplication by q on H2(). So via Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula [\cite=Gr] and the fact that [formula], we conclude The question becomes whether H3() dies or not.

We now construct X and show H3()  ≠  0 for this X. The mod p reduction in [formula] of the model [formula] of F defined by the same equation px50 + x51 + x52 + x53 is the cone over the Fermat curve [formula] of equation x51 + x52 + x53. Then μ5 acquires one single fix point [formula] which is the vertex of [formula]. We base change [formula] via π5 = p and denote by [formula] the residue field and [formula] the local field. So [formula] is defined by the equation π5x50 + x51 + x52 + x53. The μ5 operation is still defined by ξ  ·  xi  =  ξixi and now the only fix point [formula] is at the same time the only point in which [formula] is not regular. The affine equation of [formula] in [formula] with coordinates [formula] on which μ5 acts via ξ  ·  Xi  =  ξiXi, is π5 + X51 + X52 + X53. We blow up the singularity x to obtain [formula]. Then σ- 1(x) is isomorphic to the Fermat quintic Z2 in [formula] of equation X50 + X51 + X52 + X53 with action ξ  ·  Xi  =  ξiXi. Consequently, μ5 acts fix point free on F' and the quotient X, which is defined over R, is a regular model of [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is the union of two components, one being the blow up Z1 in the vertex of [formula], the other one being the Fermat quintic Z2. Thus the mod p fiber Y of X has two components Si = Zi  /  μ5. They meet along [formula]. As p  ≠  5, the covering [formula] is étale, and genus(C) = 2.

The normalization sequence for Y yields a Frob equivariant exact sequence On the other hand, one has

[formula]

Thus which shows H3()  ≠  0.

Discussion

Higher dimension

One can produce examples as above in all dimensions by taking the product [formula], which is still regular. Then [formula] for all i, while [formula] for all j  ≥  0.

Motivic condition

From [\eqref=2.1], using [\eqref=2.2] and applying [\cite=DE], Corollary 0.4 to the eigenvalues of Hi(Xu), we see immediately that the eigenvalues of Frob on Hi() fulfill Here Nκ is the coniveau filtration as explained in the Introduction.

In [\cite=Fakh], N. Fakhruddin analyzes the motivic conditions for a family [formula] defined over a finite field k, with [formula] smooth, to have the property that a singular fiber Y over a closed point s with residue field [formula] fulfills the property [formula] modulo qκ. More precisely, he studies the motivic conditions in a geometric family forcing the eigenvalue behavior described in [\eqref=3.1]. He singles out three conditions. We explain them and analyze the consequences they have on the completion [formula] at s of the family f. Here R is the completion of the equal characteristic ring of functions at s∈S. Surely, as in [\cite=EsPoint], the first one is base change for the Chow groups CHi(X̄),i  ≤  (κ - 1). We know by Bloch's type argument that this implies the coniveau condition in level κ on H*(X̄) / H*(X̄)alg, but we are extremely far of understanding that this is equivalent to it, as predicted by the general Bloch-Beilinson conjectures. The second one is that [formula] are constant local systems. This is to say that the specialization map Hi()  →  Hi(X̄) is an isomorphism, which in particular forces spu to be injective, but is stronger than this. So we see that those two conditions imply the weaker cohomological conditions in [\eqref=3.1] which already force the eigenvalue conclusion on Hi(). The third condition says that the Chow groups CHi(),i  ≤  (κ - 1), are hit by specialization. This should translate into the condition spu injective above, which is then a consequence of the cohomological consequence of the condition forcing [formula] being a constant local system.

At any rate, even if, as explained above, the conditions developed in [\cite=Fakh] are far from sharpness, they tacitly raise the question of a finer formulation, and are a motivation for this note.

Formula

It is of course extremely rare that one can check motivic conditions. It is in the rule easier to control cohomological conditions, and [\eqref=3.1] gives conditions for a good behavior of rational points on Y. However, the condition spu injective is very nongeometric and likely very nonnatural as well. It would be better to understand a finer condition on the contribution of [formula] in Hi() via the sequence [\eqref=2.1].
