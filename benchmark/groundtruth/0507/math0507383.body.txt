classification of cubics up to affine transformations

Introduction

An algebraic curve over a field K is the solution set of an equation f(x,y) = 0, where f(x,y) is a polynomial in x and y with coefficients in K, and the degree of f is the maximum degree of each of its terms (monomials). A cubic curve is an algebraic curve of order 3 with [formula] real numbers.

One of Isaac Newton's many accomplishments was the classification of the cubic curves. He showed that all cubics can be generated by the projection of the five divergent cubic parabolas. Newton's classification of cubic curves appeared in the chapter "Curves" in Lexicon Technicum [\cite=Lex], by John Harris published in London in 1710. Newton also classified all cubics into 72 types, missing six of them. In addition, he showed that any cubic can be obtained by a suitable projection of the elliptic curve

[formula]

where the projection is a birational transformation, and the general cubic can also be written as

[formula]

This classification was criticized by Euler, because of it's lack of generality. There are also other classifications, ranging from 57 to 219 types. The one with the 219 classes was given by Plucker.

We classify cubics up to affine transformations, in seven class, and give a complete set of representatives of the these classes. This result is complete and briefer than the similar results. We done this by studying the structure of symmetries of the of an special differential equation which M is it's solution.

Forming the problem

Let [formula] have the standard structure with the identity chart (x,y) and ∂x: = ∂  /  ∂x and ∂y: = ∂  /  ∂y are the standard vector fields on [formula]. Let

[formula]

have the induced differentiable structure from [formula]. Let M be the set of all sub-manifolds in the form ([\ref=eq:1]) with c230 + c221 + c212 + c203  ≠  0. M can be regarded as an open sub-manifold [formula] of [formula], with the trivial chart:

[formula]

Let [formula] be the Lie group of real affine transformations in the plan:

[formula]

Which, act on [formula] as

[formula]

The Lie algebra [formula] of this Lie group spanned by

[formula]

over [formula]. [formula] as a Lie group act on [formula] and so on the set M of all sub-manifolds in the form ([\ref=eq:1]) of [formula]. Two curves C1 and C2 in the form ([\ref=eq:1]) are said to be equivalence, if there exists an element T of [formula] as ([\ref=eq:3]) such that T(C1) = C2. This relation partition M into disjoint cosets. The main idea of this paper is to realize these cosets by giving a complete set of representatives.

Theorem 1.

Every cubic curve ([\ref=eq:1]) can be transformed into a cubic in the form

[formula]

with C  ≥  0, by an affine transformation.

Proof: Let [formula] act on [formula] and result be [formula]. There are two cases,

Let c30  ≠  0 or c03  ≠  0. If one of these numbers is zero, we can transform C into a similar curve with non-zero c30 and c03, by using the affine transformation (x,y)  ↦  (x + y,x). Therefore, we can assume that c30 and c03 are non-zero. Now, we have

[formula]

Let 12 = 0 and solving the result equation for a11, we find that

[formula]

Thus, by putting a11 in 30 and 03, we have

[formula]

Now, if we can assume that

[formula]

then, 30  =  21 and 12  =  03 = 0. The equation ([\ref=eq:3]) is an third order in a22 and the coefficient of a322 is c03  ≠  0. Therefore, has a real solution. On the other hand, if the left hand side of the ([\ref=eq:4]) be zero, for all a12  ≠  0, then it must be c30 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the relations ([\ref=eq:3]) and ([\ref=eq:4]) can be valid. Because a12  ≠  0, we can choose a21 such that det (g) = a11a22 - a12a21  ≠  0.

Let c30 = c03 = 0. Therefore, c21  ≠  0 or c12  ≠  0. Assume, g  ·  (x,y) = (x + αy,y). Then, we have

[formula]

Because c21  ≠  0 or c12  ≠  0, we can choose α such that 03  ≠  0, and this is the case (a).

If C < 0, we can apply the transformation (x,y)  ↦  ( - x, - y), and take a curve with [formula].  [formula]

Definition 1.

The set of all cubics of the form ([\ref=eq:2]) is denoted by M, and define [formula] by

[formula]

as a chart of M. Then, M has a six-dimensional manifold structure isomorphic to [formula]:

[formula]

Conclusion 1.

M is a regular six-dimensional sub-manifold with boundry of M, and a section of action [formula] on M.  [formula]

Conclusion 2.

We can classify M up to affine transformations, instead of M.  [formula]

Reducing the problem

Let C  =  φ(A,B,C,D,E,F)∈M and (y,x)∈M. The equation ([\ref=eq:2]) can be writen as f: = x3 + x2y - Ax2 - Bxy - Cy2 - Dx - Ey - F = 0. Since ∂f / ∂y = x2 - Bx - 2Cy - E and by the initial assumption C is of order 3 in x, then ∂f / ∂y  ≠  0 for all (x,y)∈C, without a finite set of points. Therefore, we can assume y is a function of x in almost every points of C. Now, we can prolong y up to sixth order j6y, and forming J6C the sixth order jet space of M. For this, it is enough to compute the sixth order total derivative of equation ([\ref=eq:2]). That is, we apply

[formula]

in six times. In this manner, we find six equation. By solving these equations for A, B, C, D, E and F, and substitute these values into ([\ref=eq:2]), we find that

Theorem 2.

If (x,y,y',y'',y(3),y(4),y(5),y(6)) be the standard chart of [formula], then the curve φ- 1(A,B,C,D,E,F) in [formula] prolonged into the hyper-surface

[formula]

in [formula]. Which is a five order algebraic curve in [formula], or a six order and five degree ordinary differential equation in [formula].  [formula]

Conclusion 3.

We can classify E the solution set of ([\ref=eq:5]) up to affine transformations, instead of M. That is, we find the [formula]invariant solutions of the ODE ([\ref=eq:5]).  [formula]

Solving the problem

In order to find the symmetries of the differential equation ([\ref=eq:5]), we use the method which is described in the page 104 of [\cite=Olv]. Let [formula] be an arbitrary element of [formula], and prolong it to the [formula], which actis on ([\ref=eq:5]). Because the variables x, y, y', y'', y(3), y(4), y(5) and y(6) are independent in [formula], we obtain a system of 422 partial differential equations for ξ and η. Reducing this system by the method of Gauss-Jordan, and find the following

[formula]

This system too, in turn equivalented to

[formula]

The general solution of this system is

[formula]

Which C1, C2, C3 and C4 are arbitrary numbers. Therefore,

Theorem 3.

There is only four linearly independent infinitesimal generators for the action of [formula] on the solution of ([\ref=eq:5]):

[formula]

The commutator table of [formula] is:

[formula]

[formula]

Definition 2.

Let G be the closed connected Lie sub-group of [formula], which it's Lie algebra is [formula].

Conclusion 4.

The necessary and sufficient condition for a one-parameter Lie transformation T leaves E invariant, is that the corresponding infinitesimal transformation belongs to [formula]. That is, be a linear combination of X1, X2, X3 and X4 of ([\ref=tr])  [formula]

Now, we study the action of G on M. To this end, we find the one-parameter transformation group corresponding to any generators of [formula], and then, applying those on φ(A,B,C,D,E,F)∈M. For example, if exp (tX4)  ·  (x,y) = (x̄,), then must have

[formula]

Therefore, (t) = x and (t) =   ±  et(y - x) - x. In a similar fashion, we can prove that

Theorem 4.

A set of generating infinitesimal one-parameter sub-groups of action G are

[formula]

Now, In order to a complete list of G - invariants on M, applying the each of infinitesimals of ([\ref=inf]) on φ- 1(A,B,C,D,E,F): For example, for 4 we have

[formula]

In a similar fashion, we can prove that

Theorem 5.

If i be the infinitesimal generator corresponding to one-parameter Lie group gi, then

[formula]

If I be an G - invariant, then it is necessary and sufficient that I be a solution of the PDE

[formula]

Therefore,

Theorem 6.

Every sixth order G - invariant of action [formula] on M is a function of following invriants

[formula]

Conclusion 5.

Let C1 and C2 are two curves in the form ([\ref=eq:2]). The necessary condition for C1 and C2 being equivalent, is that I1(C1) = I1(C1) and I2(C1) = I2(C1).

Now, we choose one representative from every equivalent coset, by applying the generating one-parameter groups of [formula] on φ- 1(A,B,C,D,E,F)∈M. This, can reduce the section M to a minimal section of the group action [formula]. on M. That is, a section with one element from any coset. this complete the Conclusion 5, and prove the sufficient version of this fact.

Let gi(ti), with i = 1,2,3,4 of ([\ref=gis]) operate respectively on φ- 1(A,B,C,D,E,F), where [formula]. Consider following seven cases:

Case 1.

If C > 0 and

[formula]

then, we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,1,D1,0,F1), with ε  =   sgn(Δ1)∈{ - 1,1},

[formula]

We define

[formula]

Case 2.

If C > 0, Δ1 = 0 and

[formula]

then, E = 4C(B - 1) - (B2 + 8AC) / 3 and we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,1,ε - 1, - 3,F1), with a constant F1.

We define

[formula]

Case 3.

If C > 0 and Δ1  =  Δ2 = 0, then E = 4C(B - 1) - (B2 + 8AC) / 3 and we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,1, - 1, - 3,2 + Δ3 / (4C3e4t4)), where

[formula]

If [formula], we can assume 4t4  =   ln (|Δ3| / 4C3), and obtain 2 + Δ3 / (4C3e4t4) = 2 +  sgn(Δ3). Therefore, we obtain following curves:

[formula]

Case 4.

If C = Δ1 = 0 and Δ2 and Δ3 are not zero, then we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,0,ε,0,γ), where ε  =   sgn(Δ2) and γ  =   sgn(Δ3). If γ =  - 1, we can use the transformation (x,y)  ↦  ( - x, - y), and obtain a curve with γ = 1. Therefore, we obtain following curves:

[formula]

Case 5.

If C = Δ1  =  Δ2 = 0 and Δ3 be not zero, then we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,0,0,0,ε), with ε  =   sgn(Δ3). If ε =  - 1, we can use the transformation (x,y)  ↦  ( - x, - y), and obtain a curve with ε = 1. Therefore, we obtain following curve:

[formula]

Case 6.

If C = Δ1  =  Δ3 = 0 and Δ2 be not zero, then we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,0,ε,0,0), with ε  =   sgn(Δ2). Therefore, we obtain following curves:

[formula]

Case 7.

If C, Δ1, Δ2 and Δ3 are zero, then we can assume

[formula]

and obtain the curve φ- 1(0,0,0,0,0,0), or

[formula]

Therefore, we prove that

Theorem 7.

Let C be a curve in the form ([\ref=eq:2]), then only one of the following cases are possible:

C1a,b  :  x3 + x2y = y2 + ax + b, with [formula];

C2c,d  :  x3 + x2y = y2 + cx - 3y + d, with c∈{ - 2,0} and [formula];

C3e  :  x3 + x2y = y2 - x - 3y + e, with e∈{1,2,3};

C4f  :  x3 + x2y = fx + 1, with f∈{ - 1,1};

C5  :  x3 + x2y = 1;

C6g  :  x3 + x2y = gy, with g∈{ - 1,1};

C7  :  x3 + x2y = 0.

Finally, we prove the main Theorem:

Theorem 8.

Any cubic can be transformed by an affine transformation to one and only one of the following cubics:

C1a,b  :  x3 + x2y = y2 + ax + b, with [formula] and [formula];

C2c,d  :  x3 + x2y = y2 + cx - 3y + d, with c∈{ - 2,0} and [formula];

C3e  :  x3 + x2y = y2 - x - 3y + e, with e∈{1,2,3};

C4f  :  x3 + x2y = fx + 1, with f∈{ - 1,1};

C5  :  x3 + x2y = 1;

C6h  :  x3 + x2y = hx, with h∈{ - 1,1}; and

C7  :  x3 + x2y = 0.

Furthermore, the isotropic sub-group of this curves are

Iso(C1a,b) = {Id}, if a > 2;

[formula], with T(x,y) = ( - x - 2,2x + y + 2);

Iso(C2c,d) = Iso(C3e) = Iso(C4f) = {Id};

[formula], where Ta(x,y) = (ax,(a- 2 - a)x + a- 2y);

[formula], where Ta(x,y) = (ax,(a- 1 - a)x + a- 1y); and

[formula], where Ta,b(x,y) = (ax,a(b - 1)x + aby).

Proof: By the Theorem 7, every cubic belongs to one of these seven families. It is therefore enough to show that any cubic of a family is not equivalent to one of the other families.

Let C1a,b and C1A,B = g  ·  C1a,b are equivalent, and

[formula]

By solving the corresponding system of equations, and find that {t1 = t2 = 2,t3 = t4 =  - 1,A = 4 - a,B = b + 4 - 2a}, or {t1 = t2 = 0,t3 = t4 = 1,A = a,B = b}. Therefore C1a,b is equivalent to C14 - a,b + 4 - 2a, by the action T:(x,y)  ↦  ( - x - 2,2x + y + 2), where T2  =  Id. If a < 2, then 4 - a > 2, and we can restrict the curves C1a,b in [formula]. Therefore, every two cubics of type C1a,b with [formula], are not equivalent. If a > 2, then the isotropic sub-group Iso(C1a,b) of C1a,b is { Id}; and otherwise, Iso(C12,b) = {Id,T}, with T2  =  Id.

If a curve be in the form C2c,d, then Δ1 = 0, and I1 and I2 are not "undefined". Thus, every cubic of the type C1a,b is not equivalent with any cubic of type C2c,d.

This is similar to (1-2).

≥  4)   Let φ- 1(0,0,0,α,β,γ) = g  ·  C1a,b are equivalent. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that et4 - t3 = 0, which is imposible. Therefore, any curve of type C1a,b is not equivalent to any cubic of type Ca with [formula].

Let C20,d and C2, = g  ·  C20,d are equivalent. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that {t1 = et4 - 1,t2  =  1 - t1 - 2et4(t1 + 1) + e2t4,t3 = t4, = e- 3t4 - 1, = 2 + e- 4t4(d - 3) + e- 3t4}. If  = 0, then t4 = 0 and  =  - 2. If  =  - 2, then e- 3t4 =  - 3, which is impossible. Thus cubics C20,d and C2- 2,, with d  ≠  , are not equivalent; and Iso(C2c,d) = {Id}, for any c and d.

Let C3e = g  ·  C2c,d are equivalent. By solving the corresponding system of equations, and find that e- 3t4(c + 1) = 0. But c∈{ - 2,0}, which is imposible. Therefore, any curve of type C3e is not equivalent to any cubic of type C2c,d.

≥  4)   This is similar to (1-C).

Let C3e and C3ē = g  ·  C3e are equivalent. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that {t1 = et4 - 1,t2  =  1 - t1 - 2et4(t1 + 1) + e2t4,t3 = t4,ē - 2 = e- 4t4(e - 2)}. But e,ē∈{1,2,3}, therefore e = ē and t4 = 0. Thus, the curves C3e and C3ē are equivalent, if and only if e = ē; and Iso(C3e) = {Id}, for any e.

≥  4)   This is similar to (1-C).

Let C4f and [formula] are equivalent. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that {t1 = t2 = 0,t4 =  - 3t3, = et3f}. But f,∈{ - 1,1}, therefore f =  and t3 = 0. Thus, the curves C4f and [formula] are equivalent, if and only if f = ; and Iso(C4f) = {Id}, for any f.

≥  5)   Let φ- 1(0,0,0,0,α,β) = g  ·  C4f are equivalent. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that e- t4 - 2t3f = 0, which is imposible. Therefore, any curve of type C4f is not equivalent to any cubic of type Ca with [formula].

Let C5 = g  ·  C5. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that {t1 = t2 = 0,t4 = 3t3}. Therefore, [formula], where Ta(x,y) = (ax,(a- 2 - a)x + a- 2y).

≥  6)   This is similar to (4-C).

Let [formula]. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that {t1 = t2 = 0, = et4 + 2t3h}. But h,∈{ - 1,1}, therefore h =  and t4 =  - 2t3. Thus, the curves C6h and [formula] are equivalent, if and only if h = ; and [formula], where Ta(x,y) = (ax,(a- 1 - a)x + a- 1y).

This is similar to (4-C).

Let C7 = g  ·  C7. By solving the corresponding system of equations, we find that {t1 = t2 = 0}. Therefore [formula], where Ta,b(x,y) = (ax,a(b - 1)x + aby).  [formula]
