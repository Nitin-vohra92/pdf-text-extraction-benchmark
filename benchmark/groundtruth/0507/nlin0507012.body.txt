Introduction

We consider the most general two-degree of freedom, classical, time-independent Hamiltonian of the physical type (i.e. the sum of a kinetic energy and a potential energy),

[formula]

and the problem which we address is to determine all the potentials V(q1,q2) such that some unspecified integer power qnjj(t) of the general solution is a single valued function of the complex time t.

In the case of one degree of freedom, this problem only admits two solutions,

[formula]

In both cases, qn is an elliptic function and, in the second case, q is generically multivalued.

This property that the general solution of a differential equation is singlevalued, except maybe at the singularities of the equation itself, is called the Painlevé property (PP) [\cite=Cargese1996Conte].

The equations of motion for qj(t) are obtained by eliminating the momenta p1,p2 between the Hamilton's equations of motion,

[formula]

which results into the system of two coupled second order ordinary differential equations (ODE)

[formula]

together with the first integral

[formula]

To prove the Painlevé property, one must perform the two following steps.

Generation of necessary conditions for the single valuedness of the general solution. This step is algorithmic and known as the Painlevé test [\cite=Cargese1996Conte]. However, its output is only a set of necessary conditions, in our case a selection of candidate potentials V(q1,q2).

For each such candidate V, explicit integration of the equations of motion, so as to indeed check the single valuedness of the general solution.

In section [\ref=sectionSelection], we select the potentials V(q1,q2) according to the prescriptions of the Painlevé test. In section [\ref=sectionThe_seven], we present the seven so-called Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonians. In section [\ref=sectionConfluences], we establish confluences from one subset of these seven Hamiltonians to another subset, thus restricting the question of their explicit integration to the first subset. In sections [\ref=sectionPoint] and [\ref=sectionBirational], we recall the explicit integration of this first subset, the so-called "quartic" cases.

Selection of the candidate potentials V

The difficulty is that very few results exist concerning coupled systems of nonlinear ODEs possessing the Painlevé property. On the contrary, for a single ODE, many results exist, either as exhaustive lists of equations in a given class (e.g. second order first degree) which possess the PP, or as precise necessary conditions to be satisfied.

Let us therefore build, by elimination of q2, a single ODE in q1(t) in a class at least partially studied. Taking the shorthand notation

[formula]

one eliminates q1'',q2'',q2' between the system of four equations made of ([\ref=eqHamiltonianSystemOrder4]) and the first two derivatives of

[formula]

This yields

[formula]

and the fourth order first degree ODE for q1(t)

[formula]

in which the coefficients Vmn only depend on (q1'',q1) after the (implicit) elimination of q2 from ([\ref=eqHamiltonianSystem_q1second]).

The similar elimination with ([\ref=eqHamiltonianFirstIntegral]) yields the third order second degree ODE

[formula]

None of the two ODEs ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_bad]), ([\ref=eq_q1_Order3]) is very helpful to generate necessary conditions on V, but the combination which eliminates q1'''2, namely

[formula]

is quite helpful since it has only degree one in q1'''.

Indeed, in 1902 Painlevé [\cite=PaiActa] established necessary conditions for an n-th order first degree ODE

[formula]

to possess the PP, when F is assumed rational in u(n - 1),u(n - 2), algebraic in [formula], and analytic in t (we will also assume such a dependence for ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_good])).

The first necessary condition is that the highest derivative u(n), as a function of the next highest derivative u(n - 1), be a polynomial of degree at most two (i.e. that the ODE for u(n - 1) be of Riccati type),

[formula]

which is indeed the case for both ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_bad]) and ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_good]).

The second necessary condition states that, as a function of the second next highest derivative u(n - 2), each coefficient Aj has for only singularities simple poles, the poles of A1 and A0 are among those of A2, and the difference between the degrees of the numerator and denominator of Aj does not exceed - 1,1,3 for, respectively, j = 2,1,0. When applied to ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_good]), since A2 is identically zero and thus has no poles (this feature is precisely the advantage of ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_good]) over ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_bad])), this latter condition requires that the coefficients [formula] and A0 (in which, as always, q2 is eliminated from ([\ref=eqHamiltonianSystem_q1second])) be polynomials in q1'' with maximal respective degrees 1 and 3. The necessary condition arising from A1 is

[formula]

Assuming the additional condition F1(q1) = 0, the partial differential equation ([\ref=eqPDEV]) is integrated as

[formula]

in which the four functions must be further constrained.

Instead of f2(q2), let us introduce its inverse function F2(r1) from ([\ref=eqHamiltonianSystem_q1second]),

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_good]) then becomes

[formula]

in which the dependence on q1'' is also implicit through the dependence on r1 in the last two lines, and A0 must be a polynomial in q1'' of degree at most three.

The term q1'2 first constrains F2,

[formula]

in which the coefficients dj are constant, then the term depending on h2 generates the constraint

[formula]

in which the coefficients ej are constant. The resulting fourth power of q1'',

[formula]

must be canceled, which implies d4 = 0 and e5 = 0. Finally, if one performs the α-transformation

[formula]

the limit ε  →  0 of ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_form2]),

[formula]

must have the PP, which requires d3 = 0 and e4 = 0 since the constant a is arbitrary.

The other α-transformation

[formula]

should constrain f1(q1), but we have not further explored this way.

The differential equation obeyed by f2(q2),

[formula]

has the Painlevé property, and its solutions are displayed in Table [\ref=Table1]. =1.5truemm =0.5truemm

The same study about the single valuedness of q21 would lead to another, similar table listing a finite number of admissible potentials depending on a finite number of arbitrary constants. This Table [\ref=Table2] will be established in a very near future.

To conclude this first part of the Painlevé test, the admissible potentials V for which the general solution (qn11,qn22), nj  =    ±  1 or ±  2, may be single valued are built by taking the appropriate information on (fj,hj) from Tables [\ref=Table1] and [\ref=Table2]. These potentials depend on a finite number of arbitrary constants.

The second part of the Painlevé test is very well known [\cite=Kowa1890a] [\cite=GambierThese] [\cite=Cargese1996Conte] and consists in analyzing the system of two coupled second order ODEs ([\ref=eqHamiltonianSystemOrder4]), in order to enforce the absence of any branch point (either algebraic or logarithmic) whose location depends on the initial conditions (one says movable). This test is well defined only when the ODEs are algebraic, which is the probable reason for the usual discarding of the trigonometric cases. Although the test seems to have never been applied yet to the full rational cases isolated above, we will not perform here these lengthy calculations and directly skip to the question of the explicit integration of the candidate cases.

The seven Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonians

Among the set of rational potentials V(q1,q2) selected in section [\ref=sectionSelection], there exists a subset, called for historical reasons Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonians [\cite=HH]. These seven potentials, usually denoted "cubic" or "quartic" according to their global degree in (q1,q2), were in fact isolated by the condition that a second integral of the motion should exist [\cite=H1987] (Liouville integrability). The difference between the two approaches is quite important: requiring singlevaluedness generates necessary conditions on V(q1,q2), while requiring the existence of a second integral of motion only results in sufficient conditions since V(q1,q2) must be an input.

The cubic case basically arises from f1 = b1q1,f2 = a2q22  +  c2, and the quartic case from f1 = a1q21  +  c1,f2 = a2q22  +  c2, and their usual notation is as follows.

In the cubic case HH3 [\cite=CTW] [\cite=Fordy1991] [\cite=CFP1993],

[formula]

in which the constants α,β,ω1,ω2 and γ can only take the three sets of values,

[formula]

In the quartic case HH4 [\cite=RDG1982] [\cite=GDR1983],

[formula]

in which the constants A,B,C,α,β,γ,Ω1 and Ω2 can only take the four values (the notation A:B:C = p:q:r stands for [formula]),

[formula]

For each of the seven cases so isolated there exists a second constant of the motion K [\cite=Drach1919KdV] [\cite=BEF1995b] [\cite=H1984] [\cite=H1987] [\cite=BakerThesis] [\cite=BEF1995b] in involution with the Hamiltonian,

[formula]

Confluences from HH4 to HH3

As is well known, there exists a limiting process (confluence) which, starting from the Gauss hypergeometric equation, generates the sequence: Whittaker equation, Hermite-Weber and Bessel equations, Airy equation. The general solution of all these equations is therefore deductible from that of the Gauss hypergeometric equation.

A similar confluence also exists [\cite=Rom1995b] [\cite=V2003] [\cite=CMVAngers2004] among the seven HH Hamiltonians, and each cubic case can be obtained by a confluence of at least one quartic case.

The following confluences have been established,

[formula]

The absence of any confluence originating from HH4 1:6:1 still has to be explained.

Consider for instance the quartic 1:12:16,

[formula]

It admits a confluence to both the HH3 KK and SK cases,

[formula]

they are (the integers et and e1 can be chosen arbitrarily),

[formula]

and

[formula]

One checks the loss of one parameter in the process, since the three quartic parameters (α,β,ω) coalesce to only two cubic parameters (B,Ω).

From the quartic case HH4 1:2:1 to the cubic case HH3 KdV5, the confluence is

[formula]

Since the three HH3 cases have been generated from some quartic case, it is useless to find the general solution of the cubic cases.

It is quite instructive to also perform the confluence starting from HH4 1:6:8. In fact, there exist two mutually exclusive subcases of 1:6:8 which are Liouville-integrable [\cite=H1987], these are

[formula]

and, if one requires the presence of the inverse square term q- 21 in the resulting HH3 case, only the subcase HH4 1:6:8b is able to achieve a confluence to a cubic case, and only two cubic cases can be produced: HH3 KK with an additional term νKKq- 62 (therefore also Liouville integrable [\cite=H1987]) and HH3 KdV5 provided ν is nonzero. With the definition

[formula]

the results are

[formula]

and

[formula]

Integration of HH4 1:2:1 with a point transformation

The two cases HH4 1:2:1 and HH3 KdV5 are related by the (one-way) confluence ([\ref=eqConfluence_1:2:1_to_KdV5]), but their relation is even stronger, and there exists a point transformation [\cite=CMVCalogero] between this quartic 1:2:1 case H(Qj,Pj,Ω1,Ω2,A,B) and the cubic KdV5 case H(qj,pj,ω1,ω2,α,γ).

[formula]

Its action on the genus two hyperelliptic curve which integrates KdV5 [\cite=Drach1919KdV] is just a translation.

It is worthwhile to notice that the variables Q1 and Q2 of 1:2:1 and the variable q2 of KdV5 are generically multivalued.

An attempt to find point transformations between the other quartic cases and any cubic case has been unsuccessful for the moment.

Integration of the 1:6:1, 1:6:8, 1:12:16 cases with birational transformations

The classification of fourth order first degree ODEs in the class

[formula]

in which P is polynomial in y'',y',y and analytic in t, has been recently completed [\cite=Cos2000a] [\cite=Cos2000c]. Although this class is too restrictive to include our equation ([\ref=eq_q1_Order4_form2]), there exist transformations [\cite=CMVCalogero] mapping each HH4 case to at least one time-independent equation with the PP in the class ([\ref=eqclass_order4_deg1_poly]). These transformations, which are birational transformations, conserve the PP, therefore they establish the PP for all the quartic cases and, by confluence, for all the cubic cases. Their explicit form is not very compact, so we refer to Ref. [\cite=CMVCalogero] for further details.

Conclusion

Although we have not yet finished to revisit the derivation of all the two degree of freedom time-independent Hamiltonians with the Painlevé property, we thought it worthwhile to perform it starting from the basic principles, so as to avoid any a priori restriction on V(q1,q2).

About the integration of the seven Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonians, the result, already summarized elsewhere [\cite=CMVCalogero], is the following. All these seven Hamiltonians have a meromorphic general solution, expressed with hyperelliptic functions of genus two, therefore they have the Painlevé property. Moreover, these seven Hamiltonians are complete in the Painlevé sense, i.e. it is impossible to add any time-independent term to the Hamiltonian without ruining the Painlevé property.
