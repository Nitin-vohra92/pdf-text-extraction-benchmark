Abstract

We have studied the critical behaviour in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 near the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition temperature. We have analysed our dc magnetisation data near the transition temperature with the help of modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher method. We have determined the critical temperature Tc and the critical exponents, β and γ. With these values of Tc, β and γ, we plot M / (1 - T / Tc)β vs H / (1 - T / Tc)γ. All the data collapse on one of the two curves. This suggests that the data below and above Tc obeys scaling, following a single equation of state.

I. INTRODUCTION

The parent compound LaCoO3 has been studied extensively.1 - 4 This is a semiconductor with a conductivity gap of almost 0.6 eV and shows a decrease in susceptibility below 100 K with a broad maximum and a gradual reduction obeying Curie-Weiss law at higher temperatures. The magnetic properties of the system are explained by a progressive conversion of low-spin CoIII into high-spin Co3 +. In the temperature range 100K  <  T  <  350K, the ratio of the high-spin to low-spin Co reaches 50:50 with short range ordering of low-spin and high-spin Co ions. Above 600 K it behaves metallic. Substitution of Sr2 + for La3 + causes a remarkable change in the system. Due to Sr doping the material segregates into hole-rich, metallic ferromagnetic regions and a hole poor matrix like LaCoO3. The Co ions in the ferromagnetic phase are in intermediate-spin configurations.5 In La1 - xSrxCoO3, for x  <  0.2, the hole rich regions are isolated from each other and show superparamagnetic behaviour below Tc  ~  240K.5,6 These clusters freeze at a lower temperature. For x  >  0.2, the onset of ferromagnetic transition is observed .5,7,8 Metallic ferromagnetism has been suggested for the range 0.30  ≤  x  ≤  0.50.5 However, the hole-poor matrix interpenetrating the ferromagnetic regions persists to x = 0.5.5,6,9

In order to fully understand the nature of the ferromagnetic transition we carried out the study of the critical exponents in detail associated with the transition. For our study we have chosen the extreme ferromagnetic limit La0.5Sr0.5CoO3. Experimental studies of critical phenomena have been previously made on manganese oxides .10  -  12 Recently similar study has been done in La1 - xSrxMnO3 system .13,14

II. EXPERIMENTAL

The sample, La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 was prepared by a solid state reaction method starting with preheated La2O3, CoO and SrCO3. The appropriate mixture was ground and calcined at 1000oC for 1 day. The mixture was then ground again and heated at 1100oC in air for 2 days with intermediate grindings. It was then pelletized and fired in air at 1300oC for 1 day. The phase purity was checked with X rays and the sample was found to be of single phase and the diffraction pattern compared well with the reported data.

The magnetisation measurements were performed using SQUID magnetometer ( Quantum Design). The data were collected at 2 K intervals over the temperature range from 202 K to 270 K, in fields from 100 Oe to 55 kOe. The maximum deviation in the temperature was ±  0.02 K at each measuring temperature.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The second-order magnetic phase transition near the Curie point is characterised by a set of critical exponents, β(associated with the spontaneous magnetisation), γ (associated with the initial susceptibility) and δ (related to the critical magnetisation isotherm). They are defined as14

where ε  =  (T  -  Tc) / Tc, Tc is the Curie temperature and M0, h0 / M0 and A0 are the critical amplitudes. Our aim is to determine the critical exponents and the critical temperature from the magnetisation data as a function of the field at different temperatures.

Figure 1 shows the zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetisation data as a function of temperature in a field of 100 Oe. A sharp rise in the ZFC magnetisation below 240 K is considered as the signature of ferromagnetic ordering. Below the Curie temperature, FC magnetisation value is different from the ZFC value. Figure 2 shows hysteresis loop at 5 K. The loop is similar to that of a ferromagnet with small coercive force and remanence.

Figure 3 and figure 4 show the magnetisation data as a function of the magnetic field at different temperatures. Figure 5 shows the M2 vs H / M plot or the Arrot plot. According to the mean field theory near Tc, M2 vs H / M at various temperatures should show a series of parallel lines. The line at T = Tc should pass through the origin. In our case the curves in the Arrot plot are not linear. This suggests that the mean field theory is not valid. Then we tried to analyse our data according to the modified Arrot plot method. This method is based on the Arrot-Noakes equation of state .15 According to this method, the plot of M1 / β and (H / M)1 / γ at several temperatures close to Tc should give a series of parallel straight lines. We adopted this method and obtained almost parallel straight lines with the values of β and γ equal to 0.365 and 1.336 respectively. Figure 6 shows the modified Arrot plot in our case. This plot shows that the isotherms are almost parallel straight lines in the high-field region. The high field straight line portions of the isotherms can be linearly extrapolated to obtain the intercepts on the M1 / β and (H / M)1 / γ axes. From these intercepts the spontaneous magnetisation Ms(T) and the inverse susceptibility χ- 10(T) can be computed. The temperature variation of Ms(T) and the same for χ- 10(T), obtained from figure 6 are shown in figure 7 and figure 8. The continuous curves in figures 7 and 8 show the power-law fit obtained from equation (1) and (3) respectively. Then we apply Kouvel-Fisher method16 to obtain Tc, β and γ. The Kouvel-Fisher method suggests that the quantities Ms(T)(dMs(T) / dT)- 1 and χ- 10(T)(dχ- 10(T) / dT)- 1 plotted against temperature, give straight lines with slopes (1/β) and (1/γ) respectively, and the intercepts on the T-axes are equal to Tc  /  β and Tc  /  γ respectively. From figures 7 and 8 we have computed Ms(T)(dMs(T) / dT)- 1 and χ- 10(T)(dχ- 10(T) / dT)- 1. Figure 9 and figure 10 show respectively the plots of Ms(T)(dMs(T) / dT)- 1 and χ- 10(T)(dχ- 10(T) / dT)- 1 vs temperature. The linear fit to the plot shown in figure 9 gives the value of β as 0.321 ±   0.002 and Tc as 222.82 K. The linear fit to the plot shown in figure 10 gives the value of γ as 1.351 ±   0.009 and Tc as 223.18 K. Figure 11 shows M vs H plot on a log scale at few temperatures close to TC. The straight line shows the fit for the interpolated data at Tc = 223 K. This gives the value of δ as 4.39 ±   0.02.

Next we compare our data with the prediction of the scaling theory17

[formula]

where (+) and (-) signs are for above and below Tc respectively. This relation further predicts that M / |ε|β plotted as a function of H / |ε|β  +  γ give two different curves, one for temperatures below Tc and the other for temperatures above Tc. Taking the values of β, γ and Tc obtained from our analysis, the scaled data are plotted in figure 12. All the points fall on two curves, one for T  <  Tc and the other for T  >  Tc. This suggests that the value of the exponents and Tc are accurate enough.

We started analysing our data with the help of modified Arrot plot. Finally we got the exponent values as β  =  0.321  ±  0.002, γ  =  1.351  ±  0.009, δ  =  4.39  ±  0.02. Our experimental value of β is very close to 3D Ising value. However, the value of γ and δ do not match very accurately. The value of the critical exponents depend on the range of the exchange interaction J(r). According to Fisher et al.18 J(r) varies as 1 / rd + σ, where d gives the dimension of the system and σ gives a measure of the range of the interaction. If σ is greater than 2, then the Heisenberg exponents (β = 0.365, γ = 1.386 and δ = 4.8) are valid. The mean field exponents (β = 0.5, γ = 1 and δ = 3.0) are valid for σ less than half. For 1 / 2  <  σ < 2, the exponents belong to different universality class which depends upon σ. La1 - xSrxCoO3 is not a very simple ferromagnetic system. It shows a large difference between the ZFC and FC magnetisation below Tc. The hole-poor matrix is also present in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3.5 Hence one cannot expect the exponents to belong to any universality class.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied the the critical behaviour of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 polycrystalline sample from dc magnetisation measurement near Tc. We have determined the values of Tc, β, γ, δ. The value of β is very close to 3D Ising value. However, the values of γ and δ do not completely agree with any universality class.
