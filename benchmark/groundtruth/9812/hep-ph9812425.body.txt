Introduction

The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry UPQ(1) [\cite=Peccei77], with its accompanying axion [\cite=WW], continues to be the most attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD. At present axions are of great interest not only in theoretical aspects of elementary particle physics, but in some astrophysical and cosmological applications as well [\cite=Turner] [\cite=Raffelt90] [\cite=Raffelt-book]. Although the original axion is excluded experimentally, modified PQ models with very light and weakly coupled "invisible" axions are still tenable [\cite=Raffelt-book] [\cite=Peccei96]. Invisible axion models are classified into two types depending on whether or not they have a direct coupling to leptons. In KSVZ model [\cite=KSVZ] axions have only induced coupling to leptons. In DFSZ model [\cite=DFSZ] axions couple to leptons at tree level.

At present axions are strongly constrained by astrophysical and cosmological considerations which leave a rather narrow window [\cite=Raffelt-castle97] [\cite=Raffelt-school97] [\cite=Raffelt-flor98]:

[formula]

in which they can exist and provide a significant fraction or all of the cosmic dark matter. The extremely small value of the axion mass ma and, consequently, a gigantic axion lifetime in vacuum:

[formula]

does not leave any hope to observe a  →  γγ decay in laboratory conditions.

It is known that an external electromagnetic field can affect substantially decays of very light, weakly interacting particles. The examples of the strong catalyzing influence of the field on processes allowed in vacuum are radiative decays of the massive neutrino ν  →  ν'γ [\cite=GMV] and the axion a  →  γγ [\cite=MV-agg]. One of the results obtained in [\cite=GMV] [\cite=MV-agg] is that the external field removes the main suppression caused by the smallness of the decaying particle mass. To illustrate this for a  →  γγ decay [\cite=MV-agg] we give the comparison of the decay probability W(F) induced by the field with the vacuum one W(0):

[formula]

where P(χ) is some function of the field dynamical parameter.

Another special feature of the external field influence is that the field can open novel channels forbidden in vacuum. In particular, the axion decay into electron-positron pair a  →  e+e- is opened due to a specific kinematics of charged particles in the field. We have studied this decay in two classes of invisible axion models [\cite=MV-aff] [\cite=MOV-agee]. It was shown [\cite=MV-aff] that the axion lifetime in DFSZ model is reduced to 105 s in the case of the decaying axion energy ~  1 MeV in the magnetic field of strength ~  1015 G while for KSVZ axions the lifetime becomes even of order seconds [\cite=MOV-agee] for the above mentioned parameters.

However considering axions effects in astrophysical and cosmological environments it is important to take into account not only the magnetic field influence, as it was done in [\cite=MV-aff] [\cite=MOV-agee], but the plasma one as well. The most physically realistic situation is that when from both components of the active medium the plasma dominates. So, the magnetic field B is relatively weak

[formula]

(where μ and T are the electron chemical potential and temperature, respectively) and a great number of the Landau levels is excited. Whereas the condition T2  ≫  eB is fulfilled, the magnetic filed is strong enough, eB  ≫  m2e, in comparison with the known Schwinger value Be  =  m2e / e≃4.41  ·  1013 G. Possible mechanisms to generate fields as strong as B  ~  1015  -  1017 G in astrophysical objects [\cite=magnetar] [\cite=toroidal] and in the early Universe [\cite=cosmol] are widely discussed.

In this paper we investigate the field-induced axion decay into electron-positron pair a  →  e+e- in the plasma.

Matrix Element

The axion decay a  →  e+e- is described by two diagrams in Fig. [\ref=fig:agee-sum] where solid double lines imply the influence of the magnetic field on the electron wave functions and undulating double lines imply the influence of medium on the photon propagator. The diagram (a) describes this process in the model [\cite=DFSZ] with a direct axion-fermion coupling:

[formula]

where gaf  =  Cfmf  /  fa is a dimensionless coupling constant; fa is the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale; Cf is a model-dependent factor; mf is the fermion mass (electron in our case); f and a are the fermion and axion fields, respectively.

The diagram (b) describes the decay via a photon intermediate state. The effective axion-photon coupling can be presented in the form:

[formula]

where Aμ is the four potential of the quantized electromagnetic field, [formula] is the dual external field tensor; aγ is an effective coupling in the presence of the magnetic field with the dimension (energy)- 1 [\cite=MRV]:

[formula]

Here, gaγ corresponds to the well-known aγγ coupling in vacuum (diagram (a) in Fig. [\ref=fig:ag-eff]) with a constant gaγ  =  αξ  /  2πfa [\cite=Raffelt90], where ξ is the model-dependent parameter. The second term in ([\ref=eq:Gag1]) is the field-induced contribution to the effective coupling aγ which comes from a diagram (b) in Fig. [\ref=fig:ag-eff]:

[formula]

Here, f(η) is the Hardy-Stokes function and χf is the dynamic parameter:

[formula]

where ef  =  eQf, e > 0 is the elementary charge, Qf is a relative electric charge of a loop fermion; [formula] is the four-momentum of the axion. As it was pointed in [\cite=MRV] this term gives a contribution comparable with gaγ for the fermions with χf  ≫  1 only.

The decay probability of particles in the magnetic field depends on invariant field parameters. In a general case of arbitrary values of particles energies and the magnetic field strength two independent field invariants (e2(FF))1 / 2 and (e2(qFFq))1 / 3 exist. Therefore the decay probability is a function of these parameters. In the case of a relatively weak magnetic field, when a great number of the Landau levels is excited, and ultrarelativistic particles the invariant (e2(qFFq))1 / 3 occurs the largest one. So, the decay probability depends actually on the dynamic parameter χf ([\ref=eq:Chi]) only. It means that we can perform calculations in a crossed field ([formula], E  =  B) with zeroth field invariants (FF) and (F).

The matrix element of a  →  e+e- decay corresponding to the diagrams in Fig. [\ref=fig:agee-sum] is a sum:

[formula]

where S(a) corresponds the diagram (a) in Fig. [\ref=fig:agee-sum]:

[formula]

and S(b) describes the contribution from the diagram (b):

[formula]

Here, ψ(p,x) is the exact solution of the Dirac equation in the external crossed field [\cite=BLP]; [formula] and [formula] are the quasi-momenta of final electron and positron (p2  =  p'2  =  m2e); (γh)  =  γμhμ, γμ are the Dirac γ-matrices. The condition of the relative weakness of the magnetic field, eB  ≪  T2,μ2, means that from both components of the active medium the plasma determines basically the properties of the photon propagator Gαβ. The propagator can be presented as a sum of transverse and longitudinal parts:

[formula]

Here, Π(T) and Π(L) are the transverse and longitudinal eigenvalues of the polarization operator; t(λ)α (λ = 1,2) and lα denote the transverse and longitudinal photon polarization vectors:

[formula]

where uα is the four-velocity of medium.

Being integrated over the variable x the matrix element ([\ref=eq:S1]) is:

[formula]

Here, Fμν  =  kμaν  -  kνaμ (k2  =  (ka)  =  0) is the crossed field tensor; Q  =  q  -  p  -  p', [formula] is the perpendicular to [formula] component ([formula]). The bispinor U(p), which is normalized by the condition ŪU  =  2me, satisfies the Dirac equation for the free electron ((γp)  -  me)U(p)  =  0. Finally, Φ(η) is the Airy function:

[formula]

and Φ'(η)  =  dΦ(η) / dη.

Decay Probability

After integration over the phase space of the e+e- pair the decay probability is:

[formula]

where the variable x  =  E / Ea is the relative electron energy; n and n̄ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions of electrons and positrons, respectively. The functions ρ1,2 have a meaning of the average values of suppressing statistical factors and are, in general case, inside the interval 0  <  ρ1,2  <  1.

The second term in ([\ref=eq:prob-tot]) describes the contribution of the longitudinal plasmon intermediate state only and has a resonant character at a particular energy of the decaying axion Ea  ~  E. This is due to the fact that the axion and the longitudinal plasmon dispersion relations always cross for a certain wave-number k  =  E. The contribution of the transverse plasmon to the decay probability of a  →  e+e- in the ultrarelativistic case is negligibly small. The dimensionless resonance width γ in Eq. ([\ref=eq:prob-tot]) is:

[formula]

where ΓL(E) is the total width of the longitudinal plasmon; ZL is the renormalization factor of the longitudinal plasmon wave-function:

[formula]

Note that without the external field the plasmon decay into neutrino pair is kinematically allowed only. In the presence of the strong magnetic field (eB  ≫  α3E2) the main contribution to the width ΓL(E) is determined by the process of the longitudinal plasmon absorption γLe-  →  e- [\cite=MRV] which becomes possible in this kinematical region also.

Below we give the expressions for E2 and γ in two cases: i) degenerate plasma (μ  ≫  T)

[formula]

ii) nondegenerate hot plasma (T  ≫  μ)

[formula]

Considering possible applications of the result to cosmology we estimate the axion lifetime in a hot plasma. Under the early Universe conditions the hot plasma is nondegenerate one and the medium parameters ρ1,2 are inside the interval 1 / 4  <  ρ1,2  <  1. With E2 and γ ([\ref=eq:nondegen]) we obtain the following estimation for the axion lifetime (diagram (b) in Fig. [\ref=fig:agee-sum]) in the resonance region:

[formula]

It is interesting to compare Eq. ([\ref=eq:time-KSVZ]) with the axion lifetime without taking into account the resonant contribution via plasmon

[formula]

The expressions ([\ref=eq:time-KSVZ]) and ([\ref=eq:time-DFSZ]) demonstrate the strong catalyzing influence of medium, the plasma and the magnetic field, on the axion decay. Nevertheless, the axion lifetime is determined by the axion decay via the longitudinal plasmon in both invisible axion models [\cite=KSVZ] [\cite=DFSZ].
