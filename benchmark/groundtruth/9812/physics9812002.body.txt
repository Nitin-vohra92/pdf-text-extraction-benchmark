Influence of the second viscosity on the flow propagation

The second (volume) viscosity coefficient ζ can be negative in nonequilibrium media. Medium with the negative second viscosity is acoustically unstable. The nonlinear structures in the acoustically active gases is strongly different from that in the equilibrium media. In present paper we investigate some problems, connected with the second viscosity influence on flow characteristics.

Let us consider the thin body (lx / ly  ≫  M), M > 1 is the Mach number in the supersonic laminated stream of nonequilibrium gas. It is proposed that the angle of attack [formula]. It follows in the standard way ([\cite=6131ARef1]) that a system of relaxation gasdynamics equations reduces to the equation

[formula]

with the boundary conditions

[formula]

Here u    =    ∂φ  /  ∂x, φ is velocity disturbances potential, [formula], α    =    α(ζ)    <    0 is an acoustic increment, y    =    ξ2;1(x) are equations of upper and lower body surface.

Using equation (1) we obtain the coefficients of resistance Cx and lifting force Cy. In the limit case of homogeneous nonequilibrium particles distribution the expressions for these coefficients is reduced to form:

[formula]

where θ2;1(x) = ∂ξ2;1(x) / ∂x    -    δ, ξ2;1(0)    =    ly  ,  ξ2;1(lx)    =    0.

Our main result is some decrease of Cx and Cy at α    <    0, i.e. in media with negative second viscosity.

The result, presented above, is only correct for laminated streams. In the nonequilibrium media the bounds of laminar region is changed. The traditional neglect of the second viscosity in subsonics is not correct if ζ    ≫    η, where η, is the shear viscosity coefficient. For example, in CO2,N2O - gases the relation ζ  /  η    >    103, as T    >    300K. ([\cite=6131ARef2]). Therefore, the second viscosity is essential for the sound propagation and the supersonic flows.

It is shown that such neglect is only correct under following conditions

[formula]

where R is Reynolds number. In other cases the second viscosity can even be impotant for subsonic flows.

Taking into account these conditions the critical Reynolds number is obtained

[formula]

where

[formula]

vik    =    ∂vi  /  ∂xk, [formula] is a disturbance of the main flow.

At ζ    =    0, condition (2) is similar to one from the ([\cite=6131ARef1]). At ζ    >    0, the instability threshold increases comparatively with the ([\cite=6131ARef1]). Otherwise at ζ    <    0, but |B|    <    D the instability threshold decreases. Finally, at |B|    >    D the critical nomber does not exist. Moreover, at R    <    Rc the flow is unstable relatively to every low frequency disturbances.

The condition |B|    ≥    D is satisfied with Mach numbers M    ≥    (η  /  |ζ|)1 / 4 if R    ≥    1 or M    ≥    (R2η  /  |ζ|)1 / 4 if R    ≪    1.
