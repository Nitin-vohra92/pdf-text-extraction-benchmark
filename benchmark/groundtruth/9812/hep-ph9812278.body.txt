Introduction

Determining the angles of the CKM unitarity triangle, denoted by α, β and γ, is one of the important aims of the B-factories. Methods have been suggested to determine γ ([formula] Arg ([formula] where V is the CKM matrix) using decays of Bd,B+ and Bs (and their CP-conjugates) to two pseudoscalars belonging to the SU(3) octet including the effects of the Electroweak Penguin (EWP) diagrams. These methods rely on the flavor SU(3) symmetry.

Many of these methods neglect the effects of (soft) final state rescattering. In particular, the decay amplitude for B+  →  π+K0 is assumed to contain only the weak phase eiπ from the penguin diagram with the top quark in the loop. Tree level operators have the weak phase eiγ, but since they have the transition   →  s̄uū, they contribute, in the absence of rescattering, only through annihilation to this decay. Annihilation contributions are argued to be small since they are suppressed by fB / mB (in the absence of significant rescattering effects). Assuming that the B+  →  π+K0 amplitude has no eiγ weak phase, references [\cite=ghlr1] [\cite=dh] [\cite=gr] [\cite=nr2] have suggested methods to determine γ.

However, rescattering from an intermediate state, for example π0K+, created by a (color-allowed) spectator decay of a B+ due to tree level operators, can generate a significant amplitude with the weak phase eiγ in the decay B+  →  π+K0 as well. So it would be better to have a method to determine γ which does not use the assumption of no rescattering effects. Rescattering might also enhance annihilation contributions [\cite=n] and thus necessitates their inclusion.

Buras and Fleischer [\cite=bf2] gave a method to determine γ without neglecting rescattering using Bd  →  π-K+, B+  →  π+π0 decays and time dependent measurements of the Bd  →  π0KS decay. For this method, they also require time dependent analysis of, for example, Bd  →  J / ψKS to measure β. Gronau and Pirjol [\cite=gp] suggested a method using time independent measurements of all the Bd  →  πK and Bs  →  πK modes. In their method also rescattering effects are included. However, it might be diffcult to measure the neutral modes of Bs decays since that will involve tagging at hadron machines.

In this paper, we suggest a technique to determine γ including rescattering effects (and the EWP operators) using B meson decays to π's and K's. We will illustrate this technique using four cases; see table [\ref=cases].

We do not require any time dependent studies. The strategy is as follows. In cases [\ref=intro] and [\ref=bpipi], using 5 ΔS  =  0 decay modes, we determine the strong phases and magnitudes of the tree level and penguin contributions as functions of γ (assuming flavor SU(2) symmetry). Then, using flavor SU(3) symmetry, we predict the rate for one ΔS  =  1 mode in case [\ref=bpipi]. In case [\ref=intro], two ΔS = 1 modes have to be measured to make a prediction for a third ΔS = 1 mode. The measurement of the decay for which we have a prediction (as a function of γ) then determines γ. A similar idea can be applied to predict a ΔS  =  0 decay mode as a function of γ using measurements of ΔS  =  1 (and some ΔS = 0) modes (cases [\ref=bpik] and [\ref=conclude]).

The B+  →  π+π0, Bd  →  ππ,  πK modes should be relatively accessible at the e+e- and hadron machines. For the Bd decays to a CP eigenstate, we require (external) tagging (i.e., the CP-averaged decay rate is not sufficient). The Bs decay modes were accessible at LEP1 and will be accessible at hadron machines. The Bs  →  ππ decay mode (case [\ref=intro]) might be hard to measure since it requies tagging whereas in cases [\ref=bpipi] and [\ref=conclude], the Bs modes are either "self-tagging" (π+K-) or a CP-averaged measurement is sufficient (for K-K+, π0q0). In case [\ref=intro], we show that if we measure additional Bd modes, a CP-averaged measurement of the decay rate Bs  →  ππ is sufficient.

Although flavor SU(3) symmetry is used in all the four cases (as in all the other methods mentioned above), in the last section, we discuss how to take into account SU(3) breaking.

Cases 1 and 2

We will write the decay amplitudes for the decays Bi  →  M  M, where M is a pseudoscalar belonging to the flavor SU(3) octet, in terms of the 5 linearly independent SU(3) invariant amplitudes denoted by CT,P3, CT,P6, CT,P15, AT,P3 and AT,P15 (where T and P stand for the parts of these amplitudes generated by tree level and penguin operators, respectively). These SU(3) invariant amplitudes include rescattering effects. The annihilation amplitudes, A3,15, are the ones in which the quark index i of Bi is contracted directly with the Hamiltonian. Neglecting rescattering effects is equivalent to assuming CT3  -  CT6  -  CT15  =  0 and A3,15  ~  fB / mB. For example, the tree level part of the decay amplitude [formula] contains this combination of the CT amplitudes and AT15.

In this notation [\cite=d], the amplitudes for B  →  ππ decays can be written as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here, [formula] (q  =  u,c,t and [formula]) and CPq, APq denote the penguin amplitudes due to q running in the loop. I2 and I0 are the amplitudes for B  →  ππ(I = 2) and (I = 0) respectively or in other words the ΔI  =  3 / 2 and ΔI  =  1 / 2 amplitudes.

Using the unitarity of the CKM matrix, i.e., λ(d)t  =    -  λ(d)u  -  λ(d)c, we get

[formula]

where Ti = CTi  -  CPi,t  +  CPi,u and CPi  =  CPi,t  -  CPi,c. A similar notation is used for ÃTi and APi.

In the B+  →  π+π0 decay, which contains only the ΔI  =  3 / 2 amplitude, there is no contribution to CP15,q from the strong penguin diagrams since these diagrams are ΔI  =  1 / 2. Neubert and Rosner [\cite=nr1] showed that CP15,q  =  CT15  3 / 2  κq, where κq  =    (c9,q  +  c10,q)  /  (c1  +  c2) is the ratio of Wilson coefficients (WC's) of the EWP operators (with quark q running in the loop) and the tree level operators in the effective Hamiltonian. We expect c(9,10),t  ≫  c(9,10),(u,c) since the top quark EWP diagram with Z exchange is enhanced by m2t / m2Z and so henceforth we neglect κu,c and denote κt by κ. So, we get

[formula]

[formula]

Using Eqns.([\ref=notation]), ([\ref=nrresult0]) and ([\ref=nrresult]), we can rewrite [formula] [formula] as

[formula]

Since 3 / 2  κ  ~  2% and |λ(d)u|  ~  |λ(d)c|, we neglect the second term (i.e., the EWP contribution) in the right hand side of Eqn.([\ref=a2]) for now and we assume |T15|  ≈  |CT15|. We will show later how to include it. Then, using the Wolfenstein parametrization in which λ(d)u  =  |λ(d)u|eiγ and λ(d)c  =  |λ(d)c| (and similarly for d replaced by s), we get

[formula]

so that |CT15| can be obtained directly from the B+  →  π+π0 decay rate. We have chosen a phase convention such that the strong phase of CT15 is zero.

From Eqns.([\ref=b0]) and ([\ref=b+-]), we get

[formula]

The five quantities: |CT15|, T̃, P, φT̃ and φP (where the φ's are the CP conserving strong phases) can thus be determined as functions of γ from the measurements of the five rates: B+  →  π+π0, Bd  →  π+π-, Bd  →  π0π0 and the CP-conjugates of the Bd decays.

Explicitly, rotating the CP-conjugate amplitudes by ei2γ (and denoting them by "bars"), we get the triangle formed by B+  →  π+π0, Bd  →  π+π- and Bd  →  π0π0 (Eqns.([\ref=b+]), ([\ref=b0]) and ([\ref=b+-])):

[formula]

and the one formed by the CP-conjugate decays. These are shown in Fig.[\ref=figbpipi] (from Eqn.([\ref=approxa2]), I2  =  Ī2).

From Eqn.([\ref=a0]), we get

[formula]

Thus, the length of Ī0  -  I0 (obtained from Fig.[\ref=figbpipi]) gives P as a function of γ. The angle between Ī0  -  I0 and I2 is φP  +  π / 2 (see Eqns.([\ref=approxa2]) and ([\ref=idiff1])) so that the orientation of Ī0  -  I0 (obtained from Fig.[\ref=figbpipi]) gives φP independent of γ.

Similarly,

[formula]

gives φT̃ and T̃ (or knowing I0,  P and φP gives φT̃ and T̃ using Eqn.([\ref=a0])).

There is a discrete ambiguity in this procedure since in Fig.[\ref=figbpipi], the vertices C and D could be on opposite sides of I2. This has been discussed in the literature [\cite=nq] [\cite=gl].

All the analysis up to now actually relies only on flavor SU(2) symmetry.

Case 1

The Bd  →  Kπ and Bs  →  ππ amplitudes are given by [\cite=d]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From Eqns.([\ref=bk+pi-]) and ([\ref=bspipi]) and using the notation of Eqn.([\ref=notation]) and rearranging we get

[formula]

Using Eqns.([\ref=nrresult]) and ([\ref=a0]) and assuming CT15  ≈  T15, we get

[formula]

i.e., from Eqns.([\ref=b+-]) and ([\ref=bkpibspipi]), we see that the combination of the amplitudes [formula] can be obtained from the amplitude for Bd  →  π+π- by scaling the tree level contribution in the latter by |λ(s)u| / |λ(d)u| and the penguin contribution by |λ(s)c| / |λ(d)c|. In particular the EWP contribution ([formula]) is important in the last line of Eqn.([\ref=bkpibspipi1]) since, due to the CKM factors, it is comparable to the tree level contribution (unlike in the Bd  →  π+π- decay; see Eqn.([\ref=a2])).

Similarly, from Eqns.([\ref=b0]), ([\ref=bk0pi0]) and ([\ref=bspipi]), we see that the combination of the amplitudes [formula] can be obtained from the amplitude [formula] by scaling the latter by CKM factors. This gives

[formula]

We emphasize again that in obtaining the last lines of Eqns.([\ref=bkpibspipi1]) and ([\ref=bkpibspipi2]), it is crucial that we use the Neubert-Rosner result (Eqn.([\ref=nrresult])), i.e., that κ is calculable. If [formula], we can determine [formula] from the decay rate Bs  →  π+π-. Then, measuring the decay rate Bd  →  π-K+ gives [formula] as a function of γ (using Eqn.([\ref=bkpibspipi1])) (φP, φT̃, P and T̃ are already known as functions of γ). Knowing [formula] and [formula], we have a prediction for the decay rate Bd  →  K0π0 (Eqn.([\ref=bkpibspipi2])) and then γ can be determined by measuring this decay. Thus, we can determine γ, including rescattering effects, by measuring the 8 decay modes: B+  →  π+π0, Bd and d  →  π+π-,π0π0, Bd  →  π-K+, Bd  →  K0π0 and Bs  →  ππ (any one) (or CP-conjugates of the last three modes).

From Eqn.([\ref=bspipi]), we see that the decay mode Bs  →  ππ has only an annihilation contribution. If (either from experimental measurement of the Bs  →  ππ rate (or a limit on the rate) or a theoretical estimate including rescattering) the annihilation amplitude ~  A3  +  A15 does turn out to be small (smaller than, say, the experimental error in the measurement of the (magnitude) of [formula]) then, a decay rate Bd  →  πK can be predicted (as a function of γ) by simply scaling the corresponding Bd  →  ππ amplitude by CKM factors. Thus, in this case, 6 decay modes: B+  →  π+π0, Bd (and d) →  π+π-,π0π0 and any one Bd  →  πK are sufficient to determine γ.

As mentioned in the introduction, we require tagging to measure the Bs  →  ππ decay mode (i.e., the CP-averaged rate is not sufficient in the above method). If this tagged decay rate is hard to measure whereas the CP-averaged rate can be measured, we can proceed as follows. Writing [formula], the CP-averaged rate is [formula]. Measuring the Bd  →  πK decay rates, from Eqns.([\ref=bkpibspipi1]) and ([\ref=bkpibspipi2]), we can determine [formula] (and [formula]) as a function of γ. Similarly, the d  →  πK decay rates will give [formula]. Thus, the CP-averaged Bs  →  ππ rate can be predicted as a function of γ and its measurement gives γ.

Case 2

The expression for the Bs  →  K+K- decay amplitude in terms of the SU(3) invariant amplitudes is identical to that for Bd  →  π-π+, including annihilation contributions (unlike the decay mode Bd  →  π-K+), modulo CKM factors, i.e., up to λ(d)q  →  λ(s)q [\cite=d]. Thus, we also have a prediction (as a function of γ) for this decay rate and also the rate for its CP-conjugate process including all rescattering effects. So, the measurement of this CP-averaged decay rate can be used to determine γ.

Cases 3 and 4

Using the same technique as in section [\ref=bpipi], we can predict the rate for a Bd  →  ππ (or a Bs  →  πK) decay as a function of γ given the decay rates for Bd  →  πK. The difference is that in the triangle construction to determine the tree level and penguin contributions to the Bd  →  πK amplitudes, we have to take into account the EWP contributions to the Bd  →  πK amplitudes (the EWP amplitudes were neglected in the B  →  ππ triangles in section [\ref=bpipi]; see Eqns.([\ref=a2]) and ([\ref=approxa2])). So, we discuss the application of the technique again.

The decay amplitudes for Bd  →  πK (Eqns.([\ref=bk+pi-]) and ([\ref=bk0pi0])) can be written as

[formula]

[formula]

where I1 / 2 and I3 / 2 are the amplitudes for Bd decay to π  K  (I = 1 / 2) and (I  =  3 / 2) respectively. Then,

[formula]

using Eqn.([\ref=nrresult]) and |T15|  ≈  |CT15| (i.e., neglecting the EWP contribution in the B+  →  π+π0 decay). δEW is given by - |λ(s)c|  /  |λ(s)u|  3 / 2  κ  ~  O(1), i.e., as mentioned earlier, the EWP contribution is important for Bd  →  πK decays. |CT15| can be obtained from the B+  →  π+π0 decay rate as before.

I1 / 2 is given by (in analogy to I0 of section [\ref=bpipi])

[formula]

As in section [\ref=bpipi], the four quantities: [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] can thus be determined as functions of γ from the measurements of the four decay rates: Bd  →  π-K+, Bd  →  π0K0 and their CP-conjugates.

Due to the EWP contribution (see Eqn.([\ref=A3/2])), the triangle construction is a bit different in this case as shown below.

As before, we multiply the CP-conjugate amplitudes by ei2γ to get the "barred" amplitudes. In this case (unlike the case for I2 in section [\ref=bpipi]) there is an angle between I3 / 2 and Ī3 / 2 denoted by 2γ̃ and their magnitudes are functions of γ (see Eqn.([\ref=A3/2])):

[formula]

[formula]

Given γ, we can thus construct the triangles of Eqn.([\ref=A3/2]) and its CP-conjugate (see Fig.[\ref=figbpik]). As in section [\ref=bpipi], knowing the magnitudes and orientations of I1 / 2 and Ī1 / 2 from Fig.[\ref=figbpik], we can determine [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] as functions of γ, using equations similar to Eqns.([\ref=idiff1]) and ([\ref=idiff2]).

This construction also shows how to include the EWP contributions to the B+  →  π+π0 decay in section [\ref=bpipi] as follows.

Once EWP's are included, as for the case of I3 / 2 and Ī3 / 2, there is an angle [formula] between I2 and Ī2 and the magnitude of T15 will depend on γ (see Eqn.([\ref=a2])):

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is given by [formula].

Case 3

The Bd  →  K+K- amplitude is given by [\cite=d]:

[formula]

From Eqns.([\ref=b0]), ([\ref=b+-]), ([\ref=bk+pi-]), ([\ref=bk0pi0]) and ([\ref=bkk]), we can see that [formula] can be obtained from [formula] and [formula] can be obtained from [formula] by scaling the ΔS = 1 amplitudes by appropriate CKM factors, i.e., in this case, the decay mode Bd  →  K-K+ plays the role of the decay mode Bs  →  ππ of case [\ref=intro] (compare Eqns.([\ref=bspipi]) and ([\ref=bkk])). Thus, as in case [\ref=intro], we can determine γ, including all rescattering effects, by measuring the 8 decay modes: B+  →  π+π0, Bd and d  →  πK (all), Bd  →  K+K-, Bd  →  π0π0 and Bd  →  π-π+ (or CP-conjugates of the last three modes). If the annihilation amplitudes are small, as in case [\ref=intro], we can determine γ by measuring any one Bd  →  ππ decay mode, in addition to the B+  →  π+π0, Bd (and d) →  πK decay modes. As in case [\ref=intro], if we measure the CP-conjugate Bd  →  ππ rates as well, then a CP-averaged measurement of the decay rate Bd  →  K+K- suffices.

Case 4

The expressions for the decay amplitudes for Bs  →  π+K- and Bs  →  π0q0 in terms of the SU(3) invariant amplitudes are identical to those for Bd  →  π-K+ and Bd  →  π0K0, respectively, including annihilation contributions (unlike the case of Bd  →  ππ and Bd  →  πK decays), modulo the CKM factors [\cite=d]. Thus, the same method predicts the rates for the Bs  →  πK decays and the CP-conjugate processes. It suffices to use the Bs  →  K-π+ decay (or its CP-conjugate) which is a "self tagging" mode or the CP-averaged decay rate for Bs  →  π0q0. Thus, no external tagging is required.

Discussions

The analysis of the above three cases is strictly valid only in the flavor SU(3) limit. In the tree level amplitudes, i.e., CT15 and the T̃'s, the corrections due to SU(3) breaking can be taken into account more reliably in the factorization approximation and are expected to be given by fK / fπ (see, for example, Gronau et al. in [\cite=ghlr1] [\cite=nq]). For example, in Fig.[\ref=figbpik] the lengths of AF, FE and FC will have to be multiplied by fK / fπ. However, since the strong penguin amplitudes include (V - A)(V + A) type operators, the (factorizable) corrections due to SU(3) breaking there are less certain, but the corrections are still less than ~  O(30%). This is especially relevant for the cases [\ref=intro] and [\ref=bpipi] where the penguin contribution dominates in the Bd  →  πK, Bs  →  K+K- decays and we are predicting this contribution from the Bd  →  ππ decays using SU(3) symmetry. In the cases [\ref=bpik] and [\ref=conclude], we use SU(3) symmetry to predict the penguin contribution in a Bd  →  ππ (or a Bs  →  πK) decay from the Bd  →  πK decays, but now the tree level contributions dominate the Bd  →  ππ decay rate and so the uncertainty due to the SU(3) breaking in the penguin amplitudes is less important.

We have a prediction for more than one rate in some of the cases. For example, in case [\ref=conclude], we can predict both Bs  →  π+K- and its CP-conjugate decay rate or in case [\ref=intro], neglecting annihilation, we can predict the decay rates Bd  →  π-K+ and π0K0. So, we can treat the SU(3) breaking in the penguin amplitudes as an unknown and determine it (in addition to γ) from the measurement of seven decay rates.

We have also assumed that the SU(3) breaking in the strong phases is small. A possible justification is that at the energies of the final state particles ~  mb / 2, the phase shifts are not expected to be sensitive to the SU(3) breaking given by, say, mK  -  mπ (which is much smaller than the final state momenta). However, it is hard to quantify this effect.

If we measure all the B  →  ππ and Bd  →  πK decay rates, then we can compute the tree level parts of the amplitudes, both T̃ and [formula] (see Eqns.([\ref=a0]) and ([\ref=a1/2])), as functions of γ as discussed in sections [\ref=bpipi] and [\ref=bpik]. If the annihilation amplitudes are small, then we have [formula] (in the SU(3) limit) since the decay amplitudes Bd  →  ππ and Bd  →  πK are the same up to CKM factors. To include the SU(3) breaking in this analysis, we use the modified relations CT15  (ΔS = 1)  =  fK / fπ  CT15  (ΔS = 0) and [formula]. This can be used to determine γ, including SU(3) breaking (without having to to deal with SU(3) breaking in the penguin amplitudes and in the strong phases).
