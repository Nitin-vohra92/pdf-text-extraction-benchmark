ABSTRACT

It is well known that baryons can be obtained from topological solutions, known as SU(2) Skyrmions, since homotopy group Π3(SU(2)) = Z admits fermions [\cite=adkins83] [\cite=sk] [\cite=hsk]. Using collective coordinates of isospin rotation of the Skyrmion, Adkins et al. [\cite=adkins83] have performed semiclassical quantization having static properties of baryons within 30% of the corresponding experimental data. The hyperfine splittings for the SU(3) Skyrmion [\cite=su3] has been studied in two main schemes. Firstly, the SU(3) cranking method exploits rigid rotation of the Skyrmion in the collective space of SU(3) Euler angles with full diagonalization of the flavor symmetry breaking (FSB) terms [\cite=fsbsu3]. Especially, Yabu and Ando [\cite=yabu] proposed the exact diagonalization of the symmetry breaking terms by introducing higher irreducible representation mixing in the baryon wave function, which was later interpreted in terms of the multiquark structure [\cite=multi] in the baryon wave function. Secondly, Callan and Klebanov [\cite=callan] suggested an interpretation of baryons containing a heavy quark as bound states of solitons of the pion chiral Lagrangian with mesons. In their formalism, the fluctuations in the strangeness direction are treated differently from those in the isospin directions [\cite=callan] [\cite=sco].

On the other hand, the Dirac method [\cite=di] is a well known formalism to quantize physical systems with constraints. In this method, the Poisson brackets in a second-class constraint system are converted into Dirac brackets to attain self-consistency. The Dirac brackets, however, are generically field-dependent, nonlocal and contain problems related to ordering of field operators. These features are unfavorable for finding canonically conjugate pairs. To overcome the above problems, Batalin, Fradkin, and Tyutin (BFT) [\cite=BFT] developed a method which converts the second-class constraints into first-class ones by introducing auxiliary fields. Recently, this BFT scheme has been successively applied to several models of current interest [\cite=BFT1] [\cite=kpr]. Especially this BFT method [\cite=BFT] has given an additional energy term in SU(2) Skyrmion model [\cite=hkp98] and has been also applied [\cite=hong00] to an open string theory with D-branes.

The motivation of this paper is to generalize the standard flavor symmetric (FS) SU(3) Skyrmion rigid rotator approach [\cite=kleb94] to the SU(3) Skyrmion case with the pion mass and FSB terms so that one can investigate the chiral breaking pion mass and FSB effects on c the ratio of the strange-light to light-light interaction strengths and [formula] that of the strange-strange to light-light.

Now we start with the SU(3) Skyrmion Lagrangian of the form

[formula]

where fπ and fK are the pion and kaon decay constants. Here e is the dimensionless Skyrme parameter and lμ = U†∂μU with an SU(3) matrix U and M is proportional to the quark mass matrix given by

[formula]

where mπ = 138 MeV and mK = 495 MeV. Note that LFSB is the FSB correction term due to the relations mπ  ≠  mK and fπ  ≠  fK [\cite=pari91] [\cite=hong93] and the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term [\cite=wzw] is described by the action

[formula]

where N is the number of colors and the integral is done on the five-dimensional manifold [formula] with the three-space volume V, the compactified time S1 and the unit interval I needed for a local form of WZW term.

Now we consider only the rigid motions of the SU(3) Skyrmion

[formula]

Assuming maximal symmetry in the Skyrmion, we describe the hedgehog solution U0 embedded in the SU(2) isospin subgroup of SU(3)

[formula]

where the τi (i=1,2,3) are Pauli matrices, [formula] and f(r) is the chiral angle determined by minimizing the static mass E given below and for unit winding number lim r  →    ∞f(r) = 0 and f(0) = π.

Since A belongs to SU(3), [formula] is anti-Hermitian and traceless to be expressed as a linear combination of iλa as follows

[formula]

where

[formula]

After tedious algebraic manipulations, the FSB contribution to the Skyrmion Lagrangian is then expressed as

[formula]

In order to separate the SU(2) rotations from the deviations into strange directions, the time-dependent rotations can be written as [\cite=kleb90]

[formula]

with A(t)∈ SU(2) and the small rigid oscillations S(t) around the SU(2) rotations. Furthermore, we exploit the time-dependent angular velocity of the SU(2) rotation through

[formula]

Note that one can use the Euler angles for the parameterization of the rotation  [\cite=schwei91]. On the other hand the small rigid oscillations S, which were also used in Ref. [\cite=kleb94], can be described as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Including the FSB correction terms in Eq. ([\ref=fsblag]), the Skyrmion Lagrangian to order 1 / N is then given in terms of the angular velocity αi and the strange deviations D

[formula]

where χ = fK / fπ. Here the soliton energy E, the moments of inertia I1 and I2, the strength Γ0 of the chiral symmetry breaking and the inertia parameters Γi (i = 1,2,3) originated from the FSB term are respectively given by

[formula]

The momenta πih and παs, conjugate to the collective coordinates αi and the strange deviation D†α are given by

[formula]

which satisfy the Poisson brackets

[formula]

Performing Legendre transformation, we obtain the Hamiltonian to order 1 / N as follows

[formula]

where [formula].

Through the symmetrization procedure [\cite=hkp98], we can obtain the Hamiltonian of the form

[formula]

where the isospin operator [formula] is given by [formula] and the ellipsis stands for the strange-strange interaction terms of order 1 / N which can be readily read off from Eq. ([\ref=ham00]). Here one notes that the overall energy shift [formula] originates from the Weyl ordering correction in the BFT Hamiltonian scheme. (See Ref. [\cite=hp00] for details.)

Following the quantization scheme of Klebanov and Westerberg for the strangeness flavor direction [\cite=kleb94], one can obtain the Hamiltonian of the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

and a† is creation operator for constituent strange quarks and we have ignored the irrelevant creation operator b† for strange antiquarks [\cite=kleb94]. Then, introducing the angular momentum of the strange quarks

[formula]

one can rewrite the Hamiltonian ([\ref=htilde3]) as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here note that the FSB effects are included in c and [formula], through Γ1, Γ2, [formula] and χ and Γ3 in μ.

The Hamiltonian ([\ref=hjs]) then yields the structure of the hyperfine splittings as follows

[formula]

where [formula] is the total angular momentum of the quarks, and c and [formula] are the modified quantities due to the existence of the FSB effect as shown above.

Now using the experimental values of the pion and kaon decay constants fπ = 93 MeV and fK = 114 MeV, we fix the value of the Skyrmion parameter e to fit the experimental data of cexp = 0.67 to yield the predictions for the values of c and [formula]

[formula]

which are contained in Table 1, together with the experimental data and the SU(3) rigid rotator predictions without pion mass. For the massless and massive rigid rotator approaches we have used the above values for the decay constants fπ and fK to obtain both the predictions in the FS and FSB cases. As a result, we have explicitly shown that the more realistic physics considerations via the pion mass and the FSB terms improve both the c and [formula] values, as shown in Table 1.
