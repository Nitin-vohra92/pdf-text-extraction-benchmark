Observational Estimates for the Mass-Loss Rates of α Centauri and Proxima Centauri Using HST Lyα Spectra

INTRODUCTION

Coronal winds analogous to the solar wind have proven to be very difficult to detect around cool main sequence stars like the Sun. This is not surprising given the low density of the solar wind, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of only about [formula] M[formula] yr- 1, and the fact that the wind is fully ionized. These properties mean that such winds cannot be detected spectroscopically like the massive winds of hot stars and evolved cool stars.

Ionized winds would be expected to produce radio emission, and searches for this emission have provided upper limits for the mass-loss rates of many solar-like stars. However, these upper limits are typically 3 or more orders of magnitude higher than the solar mass-loss rate [\citep=ab90] [\citep=sad93] [\citep=jl96b] [\citep=ejg00]. There have been some claims of high mass-loss rates detected for a few very active stars using observations at millimeter wavelengths and studies of UV absorption features [\citep=djm89] [\citep=djm92]. However, these interpretations of the data remain highly controversial [\citep=jl96a] [\citep=jl96c]. There are theoretical arguments for large mass-loss rates from active stars [\citep=gdc76] [\citep=djm92], but [\citet=jl96c] argue that massive ionized winds would completely absorb the coronal radio emission that is commonly observed from these stars.

Fortunately, a new method for indirectly detecting winds around cool main sequence stars has recently become available, using spectroscopic observations of stellar Lyα lines made by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Models of the interaction between the solar wind and local interstellar medium (LISM) predict that charge exchange processes should create a population of heated neutral hydrogen gas throughout the heliosphere [\citep=vbb95] [\citep=gpz96] [\citep=gpz99b] [\citep=hrm00a]. This material produces a detectable absorption signature in the Lyα lines of many nearby stars [\citep=kgg97] [\citep=vvi99] [\citep=bew00b]. However, not only is heliospheric absorption detected in the data, but analogous "astrospheric" absorption from material surrounding the star is also observed in some cases.

Astrospheric Lyα absorption has by now been detected for seven nearby coronal stars, although some of the detections are tentative [\citep=bew96] [\citep=ard97] [\citep=kgg97] [\citep=bew98] [\citep=bew00a]. This absorption can only be present if a stellar wind is present, and if the star is surrounded by ISM material that is at least partially neutral. A larger stellar mass loss rate will result in a larger astrosphere and more Lyα absorption. [\citet=hrm00b] used this fact to estimate mass-loss rates for two stars (ε Ind and λ And) based on the amount of observed astrospheric absorption. In this paper, we perform a similar analysis to estimate the mass-loss rate of the α Cen binary system (G2 V+K0 V), which has also been observed to have detectable astrospheric Lyα absorption [\citep=jll96] [\citep=kgg97].

In addition, we present new HST Lyα observations of α Cen's distant companion star Proxima Cen (M5.5 Ve), which can be compared directly with the α Cen data to search for differences in astrospheric absorption that would indicate differences in stellar wind properties. Unlike the two α Cen stars, which will share the same astrosphere since their orbit has a semimajor axis of only 24 AU [\citep=dp99], Proxima Cen will have an astrosphere all to itself. Proxima Cen is about 12,000 AU from α Cen, based on its [formula] separation on the sky and its closer distance of 1.295 pc compared with 1.347 pc for α Cen [\citep=macp97]. Thus, while the LISM and heliospheric absorption should be identical toward α Cen and Proxima Cen, the astrospheric absorption should be different.

COMPARING THE LYα LINES OF α CEN AND PROXIMA CEN

Proxima Cen was observed on 2000 May 8 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on HST [\citep=bew98a]. We observed the 1150 - 1720 Å spectral range through the [formula] aperture with the moderate resolution E140M grating. The total exposure time of the E140M spectrum was 20,580 s. The data were reduced in IDL using the STIS team's CALSTIS software package [\citep=dl99]. The reduction includes assignment of wavelengths using calibration spectra obtained during the course of the observations, and a correction for scattered light is performed using the ECHELLECAT routine in the CALSTIS package. The resulting Lyα spectrum is displayed in Figure 1. The stellar emission is contaminated by narrow, weak deuterium (D I) absorption and very broad, saturated hydrogen (H I) absorption. A geocoronal emission feature is apparent at 1215.69 Å, which is removed from the data by fitting a Gaussian to the feature and then subtracting the Gaussian (see Fig. 1).

Both members of the α Cen binary system were observed in 1995 May with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) instrument that preceded STIS on board HST. The observations included high resolution spectra of the Lyα line, which were analyzed by [\citet=jll96]. The α Cen B spectrum is shown in Figure 2, where we have normalized the fluxes using the assumed stellar emission profile. Since a precise LISM H I column density could not be derived for the α Cen line of sight, [\citet=jll96] actually presented two possible stellar profiles. We use the one that results in a derived deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio of D  /  H = 1.5  ×  10- 5, the value that [\citet=jll98] finds to be consistent with very nearby ISM material along many lines of sight. The LISM H I column density derived from the α Cen B data using this profile is log NH  ~  I = 17.60.

We use this column density to estimate the stellar emission line profile for Proxima Cen (see Fig. 1) using the following procedure. By assuming this column density, we can compute a wavelength dependent opacity profile for the H I absorption, τλ. The stellar profile outside the saturated core of the H I absorption is then derived simply by extrapolating upwards from the data, multiplying the spectrum by exp (τλ). We then interpolate the profile over the saturated H I absorption core.

The green dashed line in Figure 2 shows the LISM absorption toward α Cen, based on a fit in which the H I absorption is forced to have a central velocity and Doppler broadening parameter consistent with D I and other LISM absorption lines [\citep=jll96]. Excess H I absorption is apparent on both sides of the LISM absorption. [\citet=kgg97] used hydrodynamic models of the heliosphere to show that heliospheric H I could account for the excess absorption on the red side of the line, but not the blue-side excess. The redshift of the heliospheric absorption relative to the LISM is due to the deceleration of interstellar material as it crosses the bow shock. The blue-side excess is presumably due to analogous "astrospheric" material surrounding the star, which is seen as blueshifted rather than redshifted because we are observing the material from outside the astrosphere rather than inside [\citep=kgg97].

The observed Proxima Cen fluxes are normalized to the stellar profile shown in Figure 1, and the result is plotted in Figure 2 for comparison with the α Cen B data. We shifted the Proxima Cen spectrum by 2 km s- 1 to force its D I absorption feature to line up with that of the α Cen spectrum. The Proxima Cen data have a lower spectral resolution than the α Cen B data, explaining why the D I line is broader and not as deep. The amount of observed D I absorption toward the two stars is essentially identical, as one would expect.

The Lyα absorption profiles of Proxima Cen and α Cen agree very well on the red side of the line, implying that the heliospheric absorption responsible for the aforementioned red-side excess is identical toward both stars. We would not expect to see any spatial variations in heliospheric absorption between two stars so nearby in the sky, but the data were taken five years apart and the heliosphere could have conceivably changed in the interim. The 1995 α Cen data were taken close to the minimum of the Sun's activity cycle, while the 2000 Proxima Cen data were taken close to solar maximum. Apparently, the structure of the outer heliosphere does not vary significantly during the solar activity cycle. This result is consistent with the theoretical predictions of [\citet=gpz99a], whose time-dependent heliospheric models predict little variability for global H I properties in the outer heliosphere despite the fact that the solar wind ram pressure near Earth varies by about a factor of two during the solar activity cycle [\citep=ajl90] [\citep=jdr97].

Unlike the red side of the Lyα line, the Lyα absorption profiles of α Cen and Proxima Cen do not agree well on the blue side of the line. The blue side of the Proxima Cen Lyα absorption agrees well with the estimated ISM absorption, meaning there is no detectable astrospheric absorption toward Proxima Cen, in contrast to α Cen. Note that the blue-side excess absorption seen toward α Cen and other stars has been interpreted as being due to astrospheres primarily because the properties of the absorption are consistent with theoretical expectations for astrospheric absorption. The difference in absorption between Proxima Cen and α Cen seen in Figure 2 represents the strongest purely empirical evidence that the blue-side excess absorption observed toward α Cen is indeed due to circumstellar material surrounding α Cen, which does not extend as far away as Proxima Cen. This provides particularly strong evidence for the astrospheric interpretation of the excess absorption. Differences in stellar wind properties must be responsible for the difference in astrospheric absorption. In particular, the significantly lower astrospheric H I column density of Proxima Cen suggests a much smaller astrosphere, which in turn suggests that Proxima Cen's wind is much weaker than that of α Cen.

ESTIMATING MASS-LOSS RATES

In an attempt to estimate mass-loss rates for α Cen and Proxima Cen, we compute a series of hydrodynamic models of the astrospheres assuming different loss rates (see Fig. 3). These models are extrapolated from a heliospheric model that correctly predicts the amount of heliospheric absorption for various lines of sight bew00b. We assume the same input parameters for the astrospheric models, with the following exceptions. Instead of an ISM temperature of 8000 K appropriate for the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) around the Sun, we assume a temperature of 5650 K for the ISM surrounding Alpha/Proxima Cen, since these stars are not in the LIC, but are in the cooler "G cloud" . Based on the G cloud flow vector [\citep=rl92] and the known stellar space motion of the Alpha/Proxima Cen system, we find that the stars see a slightly slower ISM wind speed than the Sun: 25 km s- 1 compared with 26 km s- 1 for the Sun. This slight difference in ISM flow velocity is also taken into account.

The "baseline" heliospheric model we are extrapolating from assumes a proton density for the wind of n(H+) = 5.0 cm- 3 at 1 AU from the Sun. In our astrospheric models, we experiment with different stellar mass-loss rates by changing n(H+). Figure 3 shows the H I density distribution for four models with mass loss rates of [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], illustrating how the size of the astrosphere increases with increasing mass loss. The H I density enhancement shown in red is the "hydrogen wall" between the bow shock and "astropause" (analogous to the "heliopause"), which will be responsible for most of the astrospheric absorption for the line of sight toward the Sun, [formula] from the upwind direction.

The models provide tracings of H I temperature, density, and projected flow velocity along the line of sight toward the Sun from which we can compute the astrospheric Lyα absorption predicted by each model. The predicted absorption of the four models is shown in Figure 2. The [formula] model reproduces the α Cen data well. This is a very sensible result, because the two α Cen stars individually have coronae with solar-like temperatures and X-ray luminosities [\citep=mh99] but collectively have about twice the surface area of the Sun, assuming radii of 1.20 R[formula] and 0.90 R[formula] for α Cen A and α Cen B, respectively . The [formula] model is the only model that does not produce too much absorption to be consistent with the Proxima Cen data, and therefore represents an upper limit for Proxima Cen's mass-loss rate ([formula]). Despite this low value Proxima Cen's mass loss per unit surface area could still be as much as 8 times larger than the Sun, since Proxima Cen's radius of 0.16 R[formula] [\citep=pmp93] implies a surface area about 40 times smaller than that of the Sun.

We should point out that our mass-loss estimates may contain sizable systematic errors since our technique of applying solar wind models with rescaled densities to stellar winds relies on significant assumptions about the applicability of these models to other stars. For example, we assume that the stellar winds have the same velocity as the solar wind at 1 AU (v = 400 km s- 1). To first order, the size of an astrosphere and the column density of astrospheric absorption should scale with the square root of the wind ram pressure, Pwind [\citep=bew98]. Since [formula], our mass loss estimates will vary inversely with the assumed wind speed. For the α Cen stars, a wind velocity equivalent to that of the Sun is clearly the best assumption, since these stars and their coronae (where the winds are accelerated) are very solar-like. However, Proxima Cen's corona has a significantly higher temperature and X-ray surface flux than the Sun [\citep=mh99], so its wind velocity is more likely to be different.

The low mass-loss rate that we find for Proxima Cen is not surprising in the sense that Proxima Cen is much smaller and dimmer than the α Cen stars and the Sun. However, like many M dwarf stars it has a surprisingly active corona that produces large flares, and it has a quiescent X-ray luminosity about equal to that of the Sun and α Cen [\citep=mh99]. Since the winds of cool main sequence stars are accelerated in the corona, one might therefore expect that Proxima Cen's wind might be as strong or stronger than that of α Cen and the Sun. Indeed, it has been proposed that the large flares on active M dwarfs like Proxima Cen should induce very large mass loss rates [\citep=gdc76] [\citep=djm92]. Our observations suggest that this is not the case. However, general conclusions about the mass-loss rates of active M dwarfs should await observations of additional active M stars, especially since Proxima Cen's activity level is quite modest compared to many M dwarfs.
