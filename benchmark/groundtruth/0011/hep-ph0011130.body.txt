Hybrid Inflation

The non-Supersymmetric Version

The most important disadvantage of inflationary scenarios such as the 'new' [\cite=new] or 'chaotic' [\cite=chaotic] ones is that they require 'tiny' coupling constants in order to reproduce the measurements of the cosmic background explorer (COBE) [\cite=cobe] on the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). This difficulty was overcome by Linde [\cite=hybrid] who proposed, in the context of non-supersymmetric grand unified theories (GUTs), the hybrid inflationary scenario. The basic idea was to use two real scalar fields χ and σ instead of one that was normally used. χ provides the 'vacuum' energy density which drives inflation, while σ is the slowly varying field during inflation. This splitting of roles between two fields allows us to reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations of the CMBR with 'natural' (not too small) values of the relevant parameters in contrast to previous realizations of inflation.

The scalar potential utilized by Linde is

[formula]

where κ, λ are dimensionless positive coupling constants and M, m are mass parameters. The vacua lie at 〈χ〉  =    ±  2M, 〈σ〉 = 0. Putting m=0, for the moment, we observe that V possesses an exactly flat direction at χ = 0 with V(χ = 0,σ) = κ2M4. The mass2 of the field χ along this flat direction is m2χ =  - κ2M2  +  λ2σ2 / 2. So, for χ = 0 and [formula], we obtain a flat valley of minima. Reintroducing m  ≠  0, this valley acquires a non-zero slope and the system can inflate as it rolls down this valley. This scenario is called hybrid since the 'vacuum' energy density (=  κ2M4) is provided by χ, while the slowly rolling field (inflaton) is σ.

The ε and η criteria (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=cosmology]) imply that, for the relevant values of parameters (see below), inflation continues until σ reaches σc, where it terminates abruptly. It is followed by a 'waterfall', i.e., a sudden entrance into an oscillatory phase about a global minimum. Since the system can fall into either of the two minima with equal probability, topological defects (monopoles, walls or cosmic strings) are copiously produced [\cite=smooth] if they are predicted by the particular particle physics model employed. So, if the underlying GUT gauge symmetry breaking (by 〈χ〉) leads to the existence of monopoles or walls, we encounter a cosmological catastrophe.

The onset of hybrid inflation requires [\cite=onset] that, at a cosmic time of order H- 1, H being the Hubble parameter during inflation, a region exists in the universe with size greater than about H- 1, where χ and σ happen to be almost uniform with negligible kinetic energies and values close to the bottom of the valley of minima. Such a region, at the Planck time tP = M- 1P (MP  ≈  1.22  ×  1019  ~  GeV is the Planck mass), would have been much larger than the Planck length [formula] and it is, thus, very difficult to imagine how it could emerge so homogeneous. Moreover, as it has been argued [\cite=initial], the initial values (at tP) of the fields in this region must be strongly restricted in order to obtain adequate inflation. Several possible solutions to this problem of initial conditions for hybrid inflation have been already proposed (see e.g., Refs.[\cite=double] [\cite=sugra] [\cite=costas]).

The quadrupole anisotropy of CMBR produced during hybrid inflation can be estimated, using the standard formulae (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=cosmology]), to be

[formula]

The COBE [\cite=cobe] result, (δT / T)Q  ≈  6.6  ×  10- 6, can then be reproduced with M  ≈  2.86  ×  1016  ~  GeV, the supersymmetric (SUSY) GUT vacuum expectation value (vev), and [formula]. Note that m  ~  1012  ~  GeV for κ, λ  ~  10- 2.

The Supersymmetric Version

Hybrid inflation turns out [\cite=lyth] to be 'tailor made' for application to globally SUSY GUTs except that an intermediate scale mass for σ cannot be obtained in this context. Actually, all scalar fields acquire masses of order m3 / 2  ~  1 ~ TeV (the gravitino mass) from soft SUSY breaking.

Let us consider the renormalizable superpotential

[formula]

where [formula], φ is a conjugate pair of GS (the standard model gauge group) singlet left handed superfields belonging to non-trivial representations of the GUT gauge group G and reducing its rank by their vevs, and S is a gauge singlet left handed superfield. The parameters κ and M (~  1016  ~  GeV) can be made positive by field redefinitions. The vanishing of the F-term FS implies that 〈〉〈φ〉 = M2, whereas the D-terms vanish for |〈〉|  =  |〈φ〉|. So, the SUSY vacua lie at 〈〉*  =  〈φ〉  =    ±  M and 〈S〉 = 0 (from [formula]). We see that W leads to the spontaneous breaking of G.

The same superpotential W gives rise to hybrid inflation. The potential derived from W in Eq.([\ref=eq:superpot]) is

[formula]

D-flatness implies * = eiθφ. We take θ = 0, so that the SUSY vacua are contained. Note that W possesses a U(1)R R-symmetry: φ  →  φ, S  →  eiαS, W  →  eiαW. Actually, W is the most general renormalizable superpotential allowed by U(1)R and G. Performing appropriate G and R-transformations, we bring [formula], φ, S on the real axis, i.e., [formula], [formula] where χ, σ are normalized real scalar fields. V then takes the form in Eq.([\ref=eq:lindepot]) with κ  =  λ and m = 0. So, Linde's potential for hybrid inflation is almost obtainable from SUSY GUTs but without the mass term of σ which is, however, crucial for driving the inflaton towards the vacua.

One way to generate the necessary slope along the inflationary trajectory is [\cite=dss] to include the one-loop radiative corrections on this trajectory (  =  φ = 0, [formula]). In fact, SUSY breaking by the 'vacuum' energy density κ2M4 along this valley causes a mass splitting in the supermultiplets [formula], φ. We obtain a Dirac fermion with mass2 equal to κ2|S|2 and two complex scalars with mass2 equal to κ2|S|2  ±  κ2M2. This leads to the existence of important one-loop radiative corrections to V on the inflationary valley which can be found from the Coleman-Weinberg formula [\cite=cw]:

[formula]

where the sum extends over all helicity states i, Fi and M2i are the fermion number and mass2 of the ith state, and Λ is a renormalization mass scale. We find that ΔV(|S|) is given by

[formula]

where z = x2  =  |S|2 / M2 and N is the dimensionality of the representations to which [formula], φ belong. For z  ≫  1 (|S|  ≫  Sc), the effective potential on this trajectory can be expanded as [\cite=dss] [\cite=lss]

[formula]

Note that the slope along the inflationary valley which is provided by these radiative corrections is Λ-independent.

From Eq.([\ref=eq:rc]) and using the standard formalism (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=cosmology]), we find that the quadrupole anisotropy of CMBR is

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

Here, NQ is the number of e-foldings suffered by our present horizon scale during inflation, and xQ  =  |SQ| / M, with SQ being the value of S when our present horizon scale crossed outside the inflationary horizon. For |SQ|  ≫  Sc, [formula]. Finally, from Eq.([\ref=eq:rc]), one finds

[formula]

The slow roll conditions (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=cosmology]) for SUSY hybrid inflation are ε,|η|  ≪  1, where

[formula]

[formula]

Note that η  →    -    ∞   as x  →  1+. However, for most relevant values of the parameters (κ  ≪  1), the slow roll conditions are violated only 'infinitesimally' close to the critical point at x = 1 (|S| = Sc). So, inflation continues practically until this point is reaches, where the 'waterfall' occurs.

From the COBE [\cite=cobe] result, (δT / T)Q  ≈  6.6  ×  10- 6, and eliminating xQ between Eqs.([\ref=eq:qa]) and ([\ref=eq:kappa]), we obtain M as a function of κ. For xQ  →    ∞  , yQ  →  xQ and xQyQΛ(x2Q)  →  1-. Thus, the maximal M is achieved in this limit and equals about 1016  ~  GeV (for N = 8, NQ  ≈  55). This value of M, although somewhat smaller than the SUSY GUT scale, is quite close to it. As a numerical example, take κ = 4  ×  10- 3 which gives M  ≈  9.57  ×  1015  ~  GeV, [formula], yQ  ≈  2.42. The slow roll conditions are violated at x - 1  ≈  7.23  ×  10- 5, where η =  - 1 (ε  ≈  8.17  ×  10- 8 at x = 1). The spectral index of density perturbations n = 1 - 6ε + 2η [\cite=liddle] is ≈  0.985.

The SUSY hybrid inflationary scenario can be considered 'natural' for the following reasons:

In summary, for all these reasons, we consider SUSY hybrid inflation (with its extensions) as an extremely 'natural' inflationary scenario.

Hybrid Inflation in Concrete SUSY GUTs

We will now discuss how the SUSY hybrid inflationary scenario can be 'embedded' in concrete SUSY GUTs. As an example, let us consider a moderate extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) based on the left-right symmetric gauge group

[formula]

(see Refs.[\cite=lss] [\cite=hier] [\cite=trieste]). The breaking of GLR to GS is achieved via a conjugate pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields c, lc with B - L (baryon minus lepton number) equal to -1, 1, which acquire vevs along their right handed neutrino directions cH, νcH corresponding to the superfields [formula], φ in Sec.[\ref=subsec:susy]. The (renormalizable) superpotential for the breaking of GLR is

[formula]

where κ, M can be made positive by field redefinitions. This superpotential leads to hybrid inflation exactly as W in Eq.([\ref=eq:superpot]). The quadrupole anisotropy of CMBR, (δT / T)Q, and the coupling constant κ are given by Eqs.([\ref=eq:qa]) and ([\ref=eq:kappa]) with N = 2 since c, lc have two components each.

An important shortcoming of MSSM is that there is no understanding of how the SUSY μ term, with the right magnitude of |μ|  ~  102 - 103  ~  GeV, arises. One way [\cite=rsym] to solve this μ problem is via a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry U(1)PQ [\cite=pq], which also solves the strong CP problem. This solution is based on the observation [\cite=kn] that the axion decay constant fa, which is the symmetry breaking scale of U(1)PQ, is (normally) 'intermediate' (~  1011 - 1012  ~  GeV) and, thus, |μ|  ~  f2a / mP. The scale fa is, in turn, ~  (m3 / 2mP)1 / 2, where [formula] is the gravity-mediated soft SUSY breaking scale (gravitino mass). In order to implement this solution of the μ problem, we introduce a pair of gauge singlet superfields N̄, N with PQ charges 1, -1 and the non-renormalizable couplings λ1N2h2 / mP, λ2N̄2N2 / mP in the superpotential. Here, h = (h(1),h(2)) is the electroweak Higgs superfield, which is a bidoublet under SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R, and λ1,2 are taken positive by redefining the phases of N̄, N. After SUSY breaking, the N̄2N2 term leads to the scalar potential:

[formula]

where A is the dimensionless coefficient of the soft SUSY breaking term corresponding to the superpotential term N̄2N2 and ε, [formula], θ are the phases of A, N̄, N respectively. Minimization of VPQ then requires |N̄| = |N|, ε + 2 + 2θ  =  π and VPQ takes the form

[formula]

For |A| > 4, the absolute minimum of the potential is at

[formula]

The μ term is generated via the N2h2 superpotential term with |μ| = 2λ1|〈N〉|2 / mP, which is of the right magnitude.

The potential VPQ also has a local minimum at N̄ = N = 0, which is separated from the global PQ minimum by a sizable potential barrier preventing a successful transition from the trivial to the PQ vacuum. This situation persists at all cosmic temperatures after the 'reheating' which follows hybrid inflation, as has been shown [\cite=jean] by considering the one-loop temperature corrections [\cite=jackiw] to the potential. We are, thus, obliged to assume that, after the end of inflation, the system emerges in the PQ vacuum since, otherwise, it will be stuck for ever in the trivial vacuum.

The gauge group GLR implies the presence of right handed neutrino superfields νci (i = 1,2,3 is the family index), which form SU(2)R doublets Lci = (νci,eci) with the SU(2)L singlet charged antileptons eci. In order to generate 'intermediate' scale masses for the νc's, we introduce the non-renormalizable superpotential couplings γiccLciLci / mP (in a basis with diagonal and positive γ's). The νc masses are then Mi = 2γiM2 / mP (with 〈c〉, 〈lc〉 taken positive by a B - L transformation). Light neutrinos acquire hierarchical masses via the seesaw mechanism and, thus, cannot play the role of hot dark matter (HDM) in the universe. They are more appropriate for a universe with non-zero cosmological constant (Λ  ≠  0) favored by recent observations [\cite=lambda]. The presence of HDM in such a universe is not necessary [\cite=lambdafit] [\cite=primack]. Note that the couplings which generate the νc masses are also responsible for the inflaton decay (see Sec.[\ref=subsec:reheat]).

From our discussion above, it is clear that the superpotential of the model must contain the following extra couplings:

[formula]

Here Qi and Li are the SU(2)L doublet left handed quark and lepton superfields, whereas Qci = (uci,dci) are the SU(2)R doublet antiquarks. The quartic terms in Eq.([\ref=eq:couplings]) carry a factor m- 1P which has been left out together with the dimensionless coupling constants and family indices.

The continuous global symmetries of this superpotential are U(1)B (and, consequently, U(1)L) with the extra superfields c, lc, S, N̄, N carrying zero baryon number, an anomalous PQ symmetry U(1)PQ, and a non-anomalous R-symmetry U(1)R. The PQ and R charges of the superfields are as follows (W carries one unit of R charge):

[formula]

[formula]

Note that U(1)B (and, thus, U(1)L) invariance is automatically implied by U(1)R even if all possible non-renormalizable terms are included in the superpotential. This is due to the fact that the R charges of the products of any three color (anti)triplets exceed unity and cannot be compensated since there are no negative R charges available.

In order to avoid undesirable mixing of the components of the L's with the ones of c or h(2) via the allowed superpotential couplings N̄NLcc, N̄NLhlc, we impose a Z2 symmetry ('lepton parity') under which L, Lc change sign. This symmetry is equivalent to Z2 'matter parity' under which L, Lc, Q, Qc change sign since U(1)B is also present and contains 'baryon parity' under which Q, Qc change sign. The only superpotential terms which are permitted by U(1)PQ, U(1)R and 'matter parity' are the ones already included and LLlclcN̄2clc and LLlclchh modulo arbitrary multiplications by non-negative powers of the combination clc. The vevs of c, lc, N̄, N leave unbroken only the symmetries GS, U(1)B and 'matter parity'.

'Reheating' and the Gravitino Constraint

A complete inflationary scenario should be followed by a successful 'reheating' satisfying the gravitino constraint [\cite=khlopov] on the 'reheat' temperature, [formula], and generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). After the end of inflation, the system falls towards the SUSY vacuum and performs damped oscillations about it. The inflaton (oscillating system) consists of the two complex scalar fields [formula] (δcH  =  cH - M, δνcH  =  νcH - M) and S, with equal mass [formula].

The oscillating fields θ and S decay into a pair of right handed neutrinos (ψνci) and sneutrinos (νci) respectively via the superpotential couplings ccLcLc and Sclc. The relevant Lagrangian terms are:

[formula]

[formula]

and the common, as it turns out, decay width is given by

[formula]

provided that the mass Mi = 2γiM2 / mP of the relevant νci satisfies the inequality Mi < minfl / 2.

To minimize the number of small coupling constants, we assume that

[formula]

so that the inflaton decays into the second heaviest right handed neutrino superfield νc2 with mass M2. The second inequality in Eq.([\ref=eq:ineq]) implies that [formula] for NQ  ≈  55. This gives [formula]. As an example, choose xQ  ≈  1.05 (bigger values cannot lead to an adequate BAU) which yields yQ  ≈  0.28. From the COBE [\cite=cobe] result, we then obtain M  ≈  4.06  ×  1015  ~  GeV, κ  ≈  4  ×  10- 4, minfl  ≈  2.3  ×  1012  ~  GeV and M3  ≈  1.35  ×  1013  ~  GeV.

The 'reheat' temperature Tr, for the MSSM spectrum, is given by [\cite=lss]

[formula]

and must satisfy the gravitino constraint [\cite=khlopov], [formula], for gravity-mediated SUSY breaking with universal boundary conditions. To maximize the 'naturalness' of the model, we take the maximal value of M2 (and, thus, γ2) allowed by this constraint. This is M2  ≈  2.7  ×  1010  ~  GeV (γ2  ≈  2  ×  10- 3). Note that, with this M2, the first inequality in Eq.([\ref=eq:ineq]) is well satisfied.

Baryogenesis via Leptogenesis

In hybrid inflationary models, it is [\cite=lepto] generally not so convenient to generate the observed BAU in the usual way, i.e., through the decay of superheavy color (anti)triplets. Some of the reasons are:

It is generally preferable to produce first a primordial lepton asymmetry [\cite=leptogenesis] which is then partly converted into baryon asymmetry by the non-perturbative electroweak sphaleron effects [\cite=sphaleron]. Actually, in the left-right model under consideration as well as in many other models, this is the only way to generate the observed BAU since the inflaton decays into right handed neutrino superfields. The subsequent decay of these superfields into lepton (antilepton) L ([formula]) and electroweak Higgs superfields can only produce a lepton asymmetry. It is important to ensure that this lepton asymmetry is not erased [\cite=turner] by lepton number violating 2  →  2 scattering processes such as LL  →  h(1)  *h(1)  * or Lh(1)  →  h(1)  * at all temperatures between Tr and 100 ~ GeV. This is automatically satisfied since the lepton asymmetry is protected [\cite=ibanez] by SUSY at temperatures between Tr and T  ~  107  ~  GeV and, for [formula], these scattering processes are well out of equilibrium provided [\cite=ibanez] [formula], which readily holds in our case (see below). For MSSM spectrum, the observed BAU nB / s is related [\cite=ibanez] to the primordial lepton asymmetry nL / s by nB / s = ( - 28 / 79)nL / s.

As already mentioned, the lepton asymmetry is produced through the decay of the superfield νc2, which emerges as decay product of the inflaton. This superfield decays into electroweak Higgs and (anti)lepton superfields. The relevant one-loop diagrams are both of the vertex and self-energy type [\cite=covi] with an exchange of νc3. The resulting lepton asymmetry is [\cite=neu]

[formula]

where |〈h(1)〉|  ≈  174 ~ , mD2,3 (mD2  ≤  mD3) are the 'Dirac' neutrino masses (in a basis where they are diagonal and positive), and c  =   cos θ, s  =   sin θ, with θ and δ being the rotation angle and phase which diagonalize the Majorana mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos. Note that Eq.([\ref=eq:leptonasym]) holds [\cite=pilaftsis] provided that M2  ≪  M3 and the decay width of νc3 is ≪  (M23 - M22) / M2, and both conditions are well satisfied in our model. Here, we concentrated on the two heaviest families (i = 2,3) and ignored the first one. We were able to do this since the analysis [\cite=giunti] of the CHOOZ experiment [\cite=chooz] shows that the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations decouple.

The light neutrino mass matrix is given by the seesaw formula:

[formula]

where mD is the 'Dirac' neutrino mass matrix and M the Majorana mass matrix of right handed neutrinos. The determinant and the trace invariance of the light neutrino mass matrix imply [\cite=neu] two constraints on the (asymptotic) parameters which take the form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where m2 = mνμ and m3 = mντ are the (positive) eigenvalues of mν.

The μ  -  τ mixing angle θ23  =  θμτ lies [\cite=neu] in the range

[formula]

where φ is the rotation angle which diagonalizes the light neutrino mass matrix in the basis where the 'Dirac' mass matrix is diagonal and θD is the 'Dirac' mixing angle (i.e., the 'unphysical' mixing angle with zero Majorana masses for the right handed neutrinos).

We take mνμ  ≈  2.6  ×  10- 3  ~   which is the central value from the small angle MSW resolution of the solar neutrino problem [\cite=smirnov]. The τ-neutrino mass is taken to be mντ  ≈  7  ×  10- 2  ~   which is the central value implied by SuperKamiokande [\cite=superk]. We choose δ  ≈    -  π / 4 to maximize - nL / s. Finally, we assume that θD is negligible, so that maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing, which is favored by SuperKamiokande [\cite=superk], corresponds to φ  ≈  π / 4.

From the determinant and trace constraints and the diagonalization of mν, we determine the value of mD3 corresponding to maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing (φ  ≈  π / 4) for any given κ. We find that a solution for mD3 exists provided that [formula]. For the numerical example in Sec.[\ref=subsec:reheat], we find mD3  ≈  8.3 ~ GeV and mD2  ≈  0.98 ~ GeV. The lepton asymmetry turns out to be nL / s  ≈   - 2.23  ×  10- 10 and, thus, the baryogenesis constraint is satisfied. We see that, with not too 'unnatural' values of κ (≈  4  ×  10- 4) and the other relevant parameters (γ2  ≈  2  ×  10- 3, γ3  ≈  1), we can not only reproduce the results of COBE [\cite=cobe] but also have a successful 'reheating' satisfying the gravitino and baryogenesis requirements together with the constraints from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

Extensions of SUSY Hybrid Inflation

In trying to apply (SUSY) hybrid inflation to higher GUT gauge groups which predict the existence of monopoles, we encounter the following problem. Inflation is terminated abruptly as the system reaches the critical point on the inflationary trajectory and is followed by the 'waterfall' regime during which the scalar fields [formula], φ develop their vevs starting from zero and the spontaneous breaking of the GUT gauge symmetry occurs. The fields [formula], φ can end up at any point of the vacuum manifold with equal probability and, thus, monopoles are copiously produced [\cite=smooth] via the Kibble mechanism [\cite=kibble] leading to a cosmological catastrophe (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=mono]).

One of the simplest GUT models predicting monopoles is the Pati-Salam (PS) model [\cite=ps] based on the gauge group GPS = SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R. These monopoles carry two units of 'Dirac' magnetic charge [\cite=magg]. We will discuss possible solutions [\cite=smooth] [\cite=jean] of the magnetic monopole problem of hybrid inflation within the SUSY PS model, although our mechanisms can be readily extended to other semi-simple gauge groups such as the 'trinification' group SU(3)c  ×  SU(3)L  ×  SU(3)R, which emerges from string theory and predicts [\cite=trinification] monopoles with triple 'Dirac' charge, and possibly to simple gauge groups such as SO(10).

Shifted Hybrid Inflation

One idea [\cite=jean] for solving the monopole problem is to include into the standard superpotential for hybrid inflation the leading non-renormalizable term, which, as explained in Sec.[\ref=subsec:susy], cannot be excluded by any symmetries. If its dimensionless coefficient is of order unity, this term can be comparable with the trilinear coupling of the standard superpotential (whose coefficient is ~  10- 3). The coexistence of these terms reveals a completely new picture. In particular, there appears a non-trivial (classically) flat direction along which GPS is spontaneously broken with the appropriate Higgs fields ([formula], φ) acquiring constant values. This 'shifted' flat direction can be used as inflationary trajectory with the necessary inclination obtained again from one-loop radiative corrections [\cite=dss]. The termination of inflation is again abrupt followed by a 'waterfall' but no monopoles are formed in this transition since GPS is already spontaneously broken during inflation.

The spontaneous breaking of the gauge group GPS to GS is achieved via the vevs of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields

[formula]

in the cH, νcH directions. The relevant part of the superpotential, which includes the leading non-renormalizable term, is

[formula]

where MS  ≈  5  ×  1017  ~  GeV is the string scale and β is taken positive for simplicity. D-flatness implies that c  * = eiθHc. We restrict ourselves to the direction with θ = 0 (c  * = Hc) containing the non-trivial inflationary path (see below). The scalar potential derived from δW then takes the form

[formula]

Defining the dimensionless variables w = |S| / M, y = |Hc| / M, we obtain

[formula]

where ξ  =  βM2  /  κM2S. This potential is a simple extension of the standard potential for SUSY hybrid inflation (which corresponds to ξ = 0) and appears in a wide class of models incorporating the leading non-renormalizable correction to the standard hybrid inflationary superpotential.

For constant w (or |S|), ṽ in Eq.([\ref=eq:vtilde]) has extrema at

[formula]

Note that the first two extrema (at y1, y2) are |S|-independent and, thus, correspond to classically flat directions, the trivial one at y1 = 0 with ṽ1 = 1, and the non-trivial one at [formula] with ṽ2 = (1 / 4ξ - 1)2, which we will use as our inflationary path. The trivial trajectory is a valley of minima for w > 1, while the non-trivial one for w > w0 = (1 / 8ξ - 1 / 2)1 / 2, which is its instability (critical) point. We take ξ < 1 / 4, so that w0 > 0 and the non-trivial trajectory is destabilized before w reaches zero (the destabilization is in the chosen direction c  * = Hc). The extrema at y3  ±, which are |S|-dependent and non-flat, do not exist for all values of w and ξ, since the expressions under the square roots in Eq.([\ref=eq:extrema]) are not always non-negative. These two extrema, at w = 0, become the SUSY vacua. The relevant SUSY vacuum (see below) corresponds to y3 -(w = 0) and, thus, the common vev v0 of c, Hc is given by

[formula]

We will now discuss the structure of ṽ and the inflationary history in the most interesting range of ξ, which is 1 / 4 > ξ > 1 / 6. For fixed w > 1, there exist two local minima at y1 = 0 and [formula], which corresponds to lower potential energy density, and a local maximum at y3 + lying between the minima. As w becomes smaller than unity, the extremum at y1 turns into a local maximum, while the extremum at y3 + disappears. The system can freely fall into the non-trivial (desirable) trajectory at y2 even if it started at y1 = 0. As we further decrease w below [formula], a pair of new extrema, a local minimum at y3 - and a local maximum at y3 +, are created between y1 and y2. As w crosses (1 / 8ξ - 1 / 2)1 / 2, the local maximum at y3 + crosses y2 becoming a local minimum. At the same time, the local minimum at y2 turns into a local maximum and inflation along the 'shifted' trajectory is terminated with the system falling into the local minimum at y3 - which, at w = 0, develops into a SUSY vacuum.

We see that, no matter where the system starts from, it always passes from the 'shifted' trajectory, where the relevant part of inflation takes place, before falling into the SUSY vacuum. So, GPS is already broken during inflation and no monopoles are produced at the 'waterfall'.

It should be noted that, after inflation, the system could fall into the minimum at y3 + instead of the one at y3 -. This, however, does not happen since in the last e-folding or so the barrier between the minima at y3 - and y2 is considerably reduced and the decay of the 'false vacuum' at y2 to the minimum at y3 - is completed within a fraction of an e-folding before the y3 + minimum even comes into existence. This transition is further accelerated by the inflationary density perturbations.

The mass spectrum on the 'shifted' trajectory can be evaluated [\cite=jean]. We find that the only mass splitting in supermultiplets occurs in the cH, νcH sector. Namely, we obtain one Majorana fermion with mass2 equal to 4κ2|S|2, which corresponds to the direction [formula], and two normalized real scalars [formula] and [formula] with m2± = 4κ2|S|2  ∓  2κ2m2. Here, m = M(1 / 4ξ - 1)1 / 2 and δcH  =  cH - v, δνcH  =  νcH - v with v = (κM2S / 2β)1 / 2 being the common value of c, Hc on the trajectory.

The radiative corrections on the non-trivial trajectory can then be found from the Coleman-Weinberg formula [\cite=cw] in Eq.([\ref=eq:deltav]) and (δT / T)Q and κ can be evaluated. We find the same expressions as in Eqs.([\ref=eq:qa]) and ([\ref=eq:kappa]) with N = 2 (N = 4) in the formula for (δT / T)Q (κ) and M generally replaced by m. The COBE [\cite=cobe] result can be reproduced, for instance, with κ  ≈  4  ×  10- 3, which corresponds to ξ = 1 / 5, v0  ≈  1.7  ×  1016  ~  GeV (for β = 1). The scales M  ≈  1.45  ×  1016  ~  GeV, m  ≈  7.23  ×  1015  ~  GeV and the 'inflationary scale', which characterizes the inflationary 'vacuum' energy density, vinfl  =  κ1 / 2m  ≈  4.57  ×  1014  ~  GeV. The spectral index n = 0.954.

The model can be completed by adding the superpotential terms

[formula]

In analogy with the model of Sec.[\ref=sec:guts], the first two terms are needed for solving the μ problem via a PQ symmetry, the third term represents the Yukuwa couplings, with F = (4,2,1), Fc = (,1,2) being the 'matter' superfields, and the fourth term is required for generating masses for the νc's (and, thus, for the ν's) and allowing the inflaton to decay. The last two terms, with G = (6,1,1), are novel and were introduced [\cite=leo] in order to give masses to the superfields cH, dcH in c, Hc.

The model possesses a PQ and a U(1) R-symmetry with charges

[formula]

[formula]

We further impose a Zmp2 symmetry ('matter parity'), under which F, Fc change sign. Additional superpotential terms allowed by the symmetries of the model are FFHcHcN̄2, FFHcHchh, FFccN̄2, FFcchh, FcFcHcHc. All superpotential terms can be multiplied by arbitrary non-negative powers of the combinations cHc, (c)4, (Hc)4. The symmetry which is left unbroken by the vevs of c, Hc, N̄ and N is GS  ×  Zmp2.

In contrast to the model in Sec.[\ref=sec:guts], B (and L) violation is present here. It comes from the last three additional superpotential terms mentioned above (and the combinations (c)4, (Hc)4) which give couplings like ucdcdcHνcH, ucdcucHecH, udcHcH, udūcHēcH with appropriate coefficients. The couplings Gcc and GHcHc also give rise to B (and L) violation. Proton can decay via effective dimension five operators generated by one-loop graphs with two of the ucH, dcH or one of the ucH, dcH and one of the νcH, ecH in the loop. Its lifetime, however, turns out to be long enough to make it practically stable.

The 'reheating' proceeds as in Sec.[\ref=subsec:reheat] with m2infl = 2κ2v20(1 - 2ξv20 / M2)2. The inflaton again decays into the superfield νc2 with mass M2 = 2γ2v20 / MS, which is evaluated by saturating the gravitino constraint. The observed BAU is again generated via a primordial leptogenesis from the subsequent decay of νc2. The gravitino constraint together with the restrictions on the primordial lepton asymmetry ([formula]) from the low deuterium abundance constraint [\cite=deuterium] on the BAU ([formula]) can be satisfied with 'natural' values of the relevant parameters and in accord with the neutrino oscillation data.

A typical solution, for κ = 4  ×  10- 3 (minfl  ≈  4.1  ×  1013  ~  GeV), is M2  ≈  5.9  ×  1010  ~  GeV, M3  ≈  1.1  ×  1015  ~  GeV (γ3 = 0.5), mνμ  ≈  7.6  ×  10- 3  ~  eV, mντ = 8  ×  10- 2  ~  eV, mD2  ≈  1.2 ~ GeV, mD3 = 120 ~ GeV, sin 22θμτ  ≈  0.87, and nL / s  ≈   - 1.8  ×  10- 10 (θ  ≈  0.016 for δ  ≈    -  π / 3).

Note that the mass scale v0 is of order 1016  ~  GeV which is consistent with the unification of the gauge coupling constants of MSSM. Also, the 'Dirac' mass parameter mD3, after including renormalization effects with large tan β and MSSM spectrum, becomes consistent with 'asymptotic' Yukawa coupling unification which is implied by SU(4)c (see Ref.[\cite=neu]). Finally, the μ-neutrino mass turns out to be consistent with the large rather than the small angle MSW resolution of the solar neutrino problem.

Smooth Hybrid Inflation

An alternative solution to the monopole problem of hybrid inflation has been proposed [\cite=smooth] some years ago. We will present it here within the SUSY PS model of Sec.[\ref=subsec:shifted], although it can be applied to other semi-simple (and possibly some simple) gauge groups too. The idea is to impose an extra Z2 symmetry under which cHc  →    -  cHc (say Hc  →   - Hc). The whole structure of the model remains unaltered except that now only even powers of the combination cHc are allowed in the superpotential terms.

The inflationary superpotential in Eq.([\ref=eq:susyinfl]) becomes

[formula]

where we absorbed the dimensionless parameters κ, β in μ, MS. The resulting scalar potential V is then given by

[formula]

where we used the dimensionless fields   =  χ / 2(μMS)1 / 2, σ̃  =  σ / 2(μMS)1 / 2 with χ, σ being normalized real scalar fields defined by cH  =  νcH  =  χ / 2, [formula] after rotating cH, νcH, S to the real axis.

The emerging picture is completely different. The flat direction at  = 0 is now a local maximum with respect to [formula] for all values of σ̃, and two 'new' symmetric valleys of minima appear [\cite=smooth] [\cite=prep] at

[formula]

They contain the SUSY vacua which lie at   =    ±  1, σ̃ = 0. It is important to note that these valleys are not classically flat. In fact, they possess an inclination already at the classical level, which can drive the inflaton towards the vacua. Thus, there is no need of radiative corrections in this case. The potential along these paths is given by [\cite=smooth] [\cite=prep]

[formula]

The system follows, from the beginning, a particular inflationary trajectory and, thus, ends up at a particular point of the vacuum manifold leading to no production of disastrous magnetic monopoles.

Inflation does not come to an abrupt end in this case since the inflationary path is stable with respect to [formula] for all σ̃'s. The value σ̃0 of σ̃ at which inflation is terminated smoothly is found from the ε and η criteria (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=cosmology]), and the derivatives [\cite=prep] of the potential along the inflationary path:

[formula]

[formula]

The quadrupole anisotropy of CMBR, (δT / T)Q, and the number of e-foldings, NQ, of our present horizon during inflation can be found from the standard formulae (see e.g., Ref.[\cite=cosmology]) and using Eq.([\ref=eq:firstder]). One advantage of this scenario is that the common vev of c, Hc, which is equal to (μMS)1 / 2, is not so rigidly constrained and, thus, can be chosen equal to the SUSY GUT scale MG  ≈  2.86  ×  1016  ~  GeV. (δT / T)Q can be approximated [\cite=smooth] as

[formula]

From the results of COBE [\cite=cobe] and taking NQ  ≈  57, we obtain MS  ≈  7.89  ×  1017  ~  GeV, μ  ≈  1.04  ×  1015  ~  GeV, which are quite 'natural'. The relevant part of inflation takes place between σQ  ≈  (9NQ / 2)1 / 6σ0  ≈  2.72  ×  1017  ~  GeV and [formula].

The inflaton with mass [formula] decays again into νc2's. One can show [\cite=prep] that the gravitino and leptogenesis constraints can be satisfied with 'natural' values of the parameters together with the restrictions from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations and SU(4)c invariance. However, this model requires slightly higher Tr's (up to 1010  ~  GeV), which are perfectly acceptable [\cite=kawasaki] provided that the branching ratio of the gravitino to photons is somewhat smaller than unity and m3 / 2 is relatively large (of the order of a few hundred GeV).

Conclusions

We have shown that, in a wide class of SUSY GUTs, hybrid inflation arises 'naturally', in the sense that no 'tiny' coupling constants are needed, the superpotential is restricted only by symmetries, and inflation can be protected against radiative and SUGRA corrections.

This inflationary scenario can be readily incorporated in concrete SUSY GUT models which simultaneously meet a number of other requirements such as the solution of the strong CP and μ problems (via a PQ symmetry), and the generation of (seesaw) masses and mixing for light neutrinos. Moreover, in these concrete models, hybrid inflation is followed by a successful 'reheating' leading to adequate baryogenesis (via a primordial leptogenesis) and satisfying the gravitino constraint on the 'reheat' temperature together with the available solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data. We give an example of such a SUSY GUT model based on the left-right symmetric gauge group SU(3)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B - L.

Natural extensions of the standard SUSY hybrid inflationary scenario, which still meet all the above requirements, can also solve the problem of the possible monopole overproduction at the end of inflation. This is vital for the application of hybrid inflation to higher GUT gauge groups such as the PS group SU(4)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R or the 'trinification' group SU(3)c  ×  SU(3)L  ×  SU(3)R predicting the existence of monopoles.
