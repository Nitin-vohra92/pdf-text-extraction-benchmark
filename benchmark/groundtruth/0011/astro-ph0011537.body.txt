Multi-wavelength observations of the red giant R Doradus with the MAPPIT interferometer

Improvements in atmospheric models for M giants requires measurements of stellar radii over a wide range of wavelengths. We present such observations for R Doradus (HR 1492; V = 5.4; spectral type M8 IIIe), a nearby Mira-like star. We used MAPPIT (Masked APerture-Plane Interference Telescope), an interferometer operating at the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope. The telescope aperture was masked with a slit and a prism was used to disperse the interference pattern in wavelength.

We measured visibility over a wide range of wavelengths and compared our observations with the M-giant models by Bessell, Brett, Hofmann, Scholz and Wood (see Hofmann et al. 1998 and references within). We find agreement in the general features, with clear drops in visibility within the TiO absorption bands. However, although some models match the visibility observations in some regions, none match across the whole spectrum. The static 1M[formula] models, in particular, did not fit our observations well. The 1.2M[formula] M-series models (and 1M[formula] D models), both of which pulsate in the fundamental mode, appear to be the best fits to our observations (see Fig. [\ref=p84ihere]).
