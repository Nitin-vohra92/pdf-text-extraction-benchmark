Radiative B Decays at CLEO

Introduction

Flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) are well known to be forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM). At higher order, however, loop diagrams (box and penguin diagrams) can generate effective flavor changing neutral currents, i.e., b  →  s and b  →  d transitions. The rates for such transitions in the SM are functions of the top quark mass as well as the masses of the W and and Z gauge bosons. Additionally, these rates are also sensitive to the exchange of heavy non-SM particles such as charged Higgs. Deviations from SM rates for b  →  s and b  →  d transitions are then a signature of physics beyond the SM. Hence, measurements of b  →  s and b  →  d transitions are an effective low energy probe of physics at a much higher energy scale. This report emphasizes studies of reactions mediated by electromagnetic penguin diagrams.

General Experimental Strategy

All data is taken at a symmetric e+e- collider in the vicinity of the Υ(4S) resonance, just above threshold for B production so that B mesons are produced nearly at rest. Approximately two-thirds of the data is taken at the resonance and one-third is taken slightly below the resonance to study continuum and to perform background subtraction. The total luminosity, summed over on and off resonance data, is 14.0  fb- 1, corresponding to 9.7  ×  106 B pairs.

Two observables are particularly useful for reconstructing B candidates. The first is the difference in energy between a B candidate and the beam energy, ΔE  =  EB  -  Ebeam. The second is the beam-constrained B-mass, [formula], where pB is the momentum of the B candidate. Additionally, the shape of spherical B events is used to distinguish them from jet-like continuum events.

Exclusive Modes

CLEO first observed the exclusive mode [formula] and continues to collect statistics. The [formula] always decays to Kπ and CLEO reconstructs four modes (K±π±,K0S,K±π0,KSπ0) to be consistent with the [formula] resonance. No other [formula] resonances lie in this mass range. The Kπ system and a hard photon are required to be consistent with the B mass using the variables ΔE and MB. The major background is from continuum (e+e-  →  q with q  =  u,d,c,s) events accompanied by a hard photon from initial state radiation or events of the type e+e-  →  (π0,η)X with π0,η  →  γγ. Both backgrounds are suppressed with appropriate events shape and π0,η vetoes. Summed over all [formula] modes, the yield versus MB distribution is shown in figure [\ref=fig:kstar].

Separated into neutral and charged B modes, the measured branching fractions are: [formula] and [formula].

CLEO's large sample of [formula] decays allows a search for direct CP violation by measuring the fractional CP asymmetry parameter ACP  =  (B(b)  -  B() / (B(b)  +  B(), where B(b) is the branching fraction of B- and 0 into [formula] and B() is the branching fraction of B+ and B0 into [formula]. Here, self-tagging [formula] decay modes are used to produce the result, summed over charged and neutral B decay modes, [formula].

CLEO has searched for resonances heavier than [formula], the [formula] and the [formula], each of which has an appreciable branching fraction to the final state Kπ: [formula] and [formula]. These modes can be distinguished because of their different helicity distributions and decay widths. Fitting the MB distribution for both decay modes yields the branching fraction results: [formula] and [formula] at 90% CL.

The likelihood contours for the fit are shown in figure [\ref=fig:contours]. These results imply that [formula], favoring models that use relativistic form factors[\cite=veseli] to predict these rates and disfavoring those with non-relativistic form factors[\cite=ali].

CLEO has also searched for b  →  dγ transitions of the form B  →  ργ and B  →  ωγ which are a means to limit the CKM ratio |Vtd / Vts| through the ratio of branching fractions [formula], where ξ is the ratio of B  →  ρ and [formula] form factors and lies in the range 0.6-0.9. The ΔE vs. M(ππ) distributions for B0  →  ρ0γ and B+  →  ρ+γ candidates are shown in figure  [\ref=fig:bdg]. The branching fraction limits are B(B0  →  ρ0γ) < 1.7  ×  10- 5 and B(B+  →  ρ+γ) < 1.3  ×  10- 5 at the 90% CL. This corresponds to R < 0.32 at the 90%CL. For the choice ξ = 0.6, this implies |Vtd / Vts| < 0.72 at 90% CL. The search for B  →  ωγ yields the limit B(B0  →  ωγ) < 0.92  ×  10- 5 at the 90% CL.

Inclusive Modes

CLEO has measured the inclusive branching fraction B(b  →  sγ) by determining the hard photons energy spectrum and then performing an ON/OFF resonance subtraction. Backgrounds for this analysis are from continuum with initial state radiation and from continuum with a high energy π0, η, or ω, where one of the daughter photons escapes detection. The ON-resonance background is suppressed by two methods. The first method uses a neural net (NN) technique based on event shape variables to separate B events from non-B events. The second technique uses a pseudo-reconstruction method and a second NN. The end result is that events are weighted by a NN output. Afterwards, OFF-resonance data is subtracted. Photon energies Eγ between 2.1  GeV  <  Eγ  <  2.7  GeV are used for the final result. Using only 3.1  fb -  1 of ON-resonance data, CLEO measures [formula], consistent with SM calculations.

CLEO has searched for direct CP violation in b  →  sγ decays for the full data sample of [formula] B events by constraining the fractional CP violation parameter ACP. Although in the SM, ACP is expected to be less than 1%, some non-SM physics scenarios[\cite=kagan][formula][\cite=aoki] permit ACP  <  10 - 40%. Events are flavor tagged using either the charge of a high momentum lepton from the "other" B or by using a pseudo-reconstruction technique similar to the one used in the inclusive b  →  sγ analysis. The typical mis-tag rate is 10%. CLEO finds - 0.22 < ACP  <   + 0.09 at the 90% CL.

Non-penguin Radiative Decays

Finally, CLEO has searched for radiative B decays not mediated by electromagnetic diagrams, as shown in figure [\ref=fig:savinov]. In the SM such decays are expected to be small but their observation would permit the importance of W exchange diagrams in B decays to be gauged. Here, the [formula] decays by π0 or γ emission and the D0 is reconstructed in the K-π+,K-π+π0,K-π+π-π+ final states. No events are found in MB  -  ΔE space which leads to the branching fraction limit[\cite=savinov] [formula] at the 90% CL.
